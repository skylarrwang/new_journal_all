points of departure
I 
took a drag, and the vapor was thick and harsh. 
The nicotine of a cigarette; the flavor of a hoo­
kah. My first taste of #VapeLife left the lungs feel­
ing clean.

Inside the brick walls of Chapel Street’s White 
Buffalo Vapors, I sat at a hardwood counter known 
as the “juice bar.” Behind the counter, shelves held 
rows of brightly colored vials of “e-juice” — liq­
uid nicotine mixed with flavored oil — everything 
from the woody notes of a heavy cigar, or a light 
strawberry blend. It was simple: choose a flavor, 
press a button on the vaporizer to heat the oil, 
and inhale. 

Since its invention just a decade ago, “vap­
ing” has exploded into a billion-dollar industry. E-
cigarettes, which seek to imitate the look and feel 
of a traditional smoking experience, are the most 
talked-about part of the trend, as a safer alterna­
tive to old-school “cancer sticks.” E-cigarettes can 
be found in gas stations and pharmacies, and they 
are relatively cheap. But, until White Buffalo Va­
pors opened in March, high-end vaping was yet to 
be found in New Haven. The pipes aren’t meant to 
replace old-fashioned smokes; crafted in the shape 
of ornate tobacco pipes or steampunk machines, 
they can cost hundreds of dollars and are meant 
for long-term use. Since it was my first time vap­
ing, I didn’t drop any cash; Noah Morganson, an 
employee, lent me his pen-shaped vaporizer.

If Chapel Street passersby happen to look in 
these days, they’d probably see a handful of peo­
ple inside, talking and vaping. But the owners of 
White Buffalo — Sammy Chamino, Sasha Zabar, 
and Max Young, all avid vapers and ex-smokers un­
der thirty — have big plans for the space. They 
started with a register, some mismatched furni­
ture, and a small case featuring a few expensive 
vaporizers, but now they are dreaming big: coffee, 
live music, a rustic vibe. This August, they tore out 
a drop ceiling and linoleum flooring to expose an 
old white tin roof and pine floor, leading all the 
way to a small back patio area, in preparation for a 
grand opening in the fall.

“We’ve had escaped convicts and police, 
firemen, and bus drivers. And lots of hipsters,” 
says Young, a quiet man with a dark beard and 
mustache. “We want to continue that kind of 
diversity.”

But the crew is still fighting against public 
distrust. E-cigarettes have exploded onto the mar­
ket without any comprehensive health studies or 
FDA regulation, leading to a frenzy of media hype:

Welcome to the August issue of the New Journal! Around 
here, we talk to strangers. We tell stories. We take our time. 
Also, we like to write.

In the last few months, we rode along with police officers, puffed on e-cigarettes, and became world 
renowned for our inventions (almost). We thought about what’s happening in New Haven these days. 
We hope you’ll follow along on our journeys.

As always, we welcome all students—freshmen and seniors; rookies and experts; writers, photogra­
phers, designers, and business managers—to join the New Journal community! Contact us at editors@
thenewjournalatyale.com if you’re interested in getting involved.

With our best wishes and highest hopes for the year ahead,
