xams were approaching, and Lauren Canalori, 
a literacy coach at Fair Haven School, was ap­
prehensive. In a few weeks, her students would 
be taking a new round of standardized tests, 
the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium 
(SBAC). It was April 2014, and the tests would 
measure how well the district’s Common Core 
curriculum, implemented over the past three 
years, was working. Canalori had helped develop 
the curriculum and train teachers to execute it; 
now, her efforts would be put to the test. On the 
untimed examination, students in grades three 
through eight would have to tackle fifteen to sev­
enteen questions, which would take an estimated 
two to four hours. Canalori’s own son would be 
taking the exam as well. 
“He’s a really strong student, he’s a think­
er, and he’s going to struggle on the test,” she 
said, after discussing the sample questions she’d 
seen. Bookshelves surrounded the round table 
at which she sat, in a small chair intended for a 
middle schooler. The brightly lit library was qui­
et after students had left the weekly lunchtime 
tutoring session.  

The Common Core, one of the largest and 
most ambitious education reforms in the history 
of the United States, is an Obama-era project that 
replaces statewide standards in reading and math 
for kindergarten through twelfth grade with na­
tional standards. In 2009, experts across the na­
tion wrote the new guidelines, aiming to reduce 
the dramatic variation in standards from state 
to state. While the federal government does not 
force states to adopt the Common Core, it pro­
vides additional funding for those that do, and for­
ty-three states have decided to make the switch. 
The New Haven test results will be released 
in the next six months, and teachers, parents, and 
students are all unsure of what they will look like. 

In New York State, where Common Core testing 
was implemented in the spring of 2013, the first 
tests were so difficult that they brought many stu­
dents to tears. In some New York schools, as many 
as eighty-five percent of students failed, according 
to The New York Times.  

The standards, which expect first-grade stu­
dents to “identify who is telling the story at vari­
ous points in a text” and fifth-grade students to 
“graph points on the coordinate plane to solve 
real-world and mathematical problems,” are not a 
curriculum in themselves. However, they do pro­
vide a classroom framework for educators. 

In Connecticut, New Haven was one of the 
first districts to embrace the standards. Students 
and teachers have spent the past few years adjust­
ing to a Common Core-aligned curriculum. And 
while educators hope that the city’s head start will 
show in the test results, opinions on the new stan­
dards are mixed.

When Carlos Torre, a member and former 
president of the New Haven Board of Education, 
talks about the Common Core, his voice is calm.
