kill you!”
Pyers still remembers her son’s remorse upon 
waking from emergency surgery hours later. “He 
remembered looking into the officer’s face and 
said, ‘I brought this man into my nightmare, and I 
shouldn’t have done that.’”
Pyers, who had already been working in the 
mental health field, soon realized that her son re­
quired a case manager to oversee his treatment, so 
she quit her job to take care of him full-time. She 
could not help but wonder: How many others had 
come before her son, using police officers as the 
instrument in their own suicides? 


She began researching the issue, and in Au­
gust of 2001, she published her findings in the FBI 
National Academy magazine. One in four officer 
shootings, she concluded, are purposefully pro­
voked by the victim—a phenomenon known as 
“suicide by cop.”
Pyers initially founded CABLE as a research 
and education non-profit to support further study 
on suicide by cop. But soon after she published 
her initial findings, she got a call from Captain 
Ken Edwards of the New London Police Depart­
ment. “I saw your information on suicide by cop,” 
she recalls him saying. “He said, ‘We’re doing a 
program here called crisis intervention training. 
Do you want to see it in action?’” Pyers had heard 
about the CIT program in Memphis, and Edwards 
told her that his department had gone to Tennes­
see to learn how the program worked. 


When she went to New London to attend 
a CIT training session, she realized for the first 
time that the scope of perilous interactions be­
tween law enforcement and people with mental 
illness extended far beyond suicide by cop. But 
she also remembers feeling surprised by the pas­
sion of the officers at the training, all of whom had 
volunteered to learn more about mental illness. 
It was the conversations with these officers, she 
says, that helped her understand the full scope of 
the problem.
After the training, she approached Edwards 
and asked him if he would help her implement 
the program statewide. In 2004, CABLE, with 
Edwards’ help, won a grant from the Connecti­

cut Department of Mental Health and Addiction 
Services (DMHAS) that would enable Pyers to 
do just that. Now, the state pays CABLE about 
$65,000 per year to run five weeklong CIT train­
ings. It also offers each police department a $1,500 
stipend per officer it sends to be trained. DMHAS 
issues about $20,000 in training stipends per year, 
according to Loel Meckel, the assistant director of 
DMHAS’s Division of Forensic Services.
The training, which spans five eight-hour days, 
includes educational lectures on different types of 
mental illness, role-plays to practice de-escalation 
skills, and a simulation of what it might feel like 
to hallucinate. For a more personal perspective, 
Pyers also invites the officer involved in her son’s 
incident to speak to the training attendees; he 
tells his story, and her son tells his own in a pre-
recorded video. 


Baranoski, the Yale professor of psychiatry, 
teaches what she calls “Mental Health 101” on the 
first day of each training. She opens the module 
with basic science: She introduces officers to sev­
eral broad classes of mental illness and their asso­
ciated symptoms. She explains how brain chemis­
try causes disturbances in thought. But, she always 
tells the officers, it is much more important for 
them to understand how to handle an individual in 
crisis than to recognize the specific illness plagu­
ing him or her. 


“The diagnosis doesn’t matter,” she explains. 
“What matters is the state that the person is in 
when the police gets involved. They’re over­
whelmed. Their usual behavior and their usual 
coping methods are not working. So how do you 
manage that? How do you get people to the right 
level of treatment?”
During the eight-hour evening shift on which 
I accompany Pepe, he receives no “Signal 90” 
calls—NHPD code for a situation involving a psy­
chiatric crisis. (The call involving the two women 
is technically classified as a “Signal 98,” a drug-
related situation.) But Pepe tells me that this is 
rare. It is not uncommon for an officer to take one 
or two Signal 90’s per shift. And even situations 
that are not technically psychiatric crises—drug-
related crises, for example—allow him to use some

of the skills that he learned in CIT training. 


Each situation requires its own set of strate­
gies, he says, but at the core of his approach is an 
attempt to understand what sort of help the men­
tally ill person actually needs.
“They might not know what’s goin’ on. So you 
have to slowly try to reel them in, to get them 
whatever help they need,” Pepe says. “Maybe they 
want medication. Maybe, at the end of the day, 
maybe the only reason they called you is because 
they’re just unsatisfied with where they live. They 
wanna go somewhere else, but they don’t know 
what to do.”
Pepe drives me past the Park Street Inn, one of 
the group-living homes he is sometimes called to. 
A converted brownstone walk-up that dates back 
to the early 1900s, the three-story home currently 
houses 15 residents with a range of mental health 
conditions and substance abuse issues. Most often 
when Pepe comes here, he has been summoned 
by one of the residents. Their complaints, he ex­
plains, are often things like “This person is talk­
ing to me mean” or “This person put his hands on 
me.” Though two on-duty staff members manage 
the home at all times, the residents are granted a 
large measure of independence, and often they are 
the ones making the 911 calls. Still, Pepe says, he is 
not sure why they turn to the police.


“Maybe we’re just a different avenue,” he spec­
ulates. “They know, maybe we’ll just get them to 
the hospital a little quicker. I don’t know what 
they know. I think they just know 911.”
A few days after accompanying Pepe on his 
shift, I go back to visit the Park Street Inn. The 
house is managed by a team of social workers, 
but they work mainly in offices at the front of the 
home, on the first floor. Residents mill about the 
rest of the cramped space, wandering down to 
the kitchen, or gathering to watch television on a 
large flat-screen in the home’s cozy dining room. 
Though the residents appear amicable when I vis­
it, Dan Collins, one of the Park Street Inn’s pro­
gram directors, tells me they occasionally clash or 
make “very poor decisions.” When one resident 
threatens the safety or well-being of another resi­
dent or staff member, he says, “Yeah, they’ll see an 
officer in blue.” 


But in the thirty or so years he has worked in 
such environments, Collins says, he has never seen 
officers interact with people who have emotional 
difficulties as well as Pepe and his colleagues do.
“Law enforcement’s understanding and skills 
at engaging our program members has just been 
getting better with each passing year,” he says. 
He rattles off the names of several officers, Mike 
Pepe’s among them, who have been particularly 
effective. “They are more at ease. And they’re 
more comfortable and skilled at making a connec­
tion with the person.”
For example, he says, an officer might try to 
move a conversation into a more comfortable 
space. We are standing in the foyer of the home, 
a tiny round room with doors and hallways shoot­
ing off in every direction and a large fish tank at 
its center. He gestures around us. “You don’t want 
an explosive situation happening in this confined 
area,” he tells me. We walk down one of the hall­
ways to the dining room, which has two red high-
backed wing chairs in one corner. “So the officer 
might say, ‘Hey, would you be comfortable going to 
sit in the dining room?’” With that simple change, 
a CIT officer could solve a problem another of­
ficer might not even have noticed. 


“‘You smell like shit.’ ‘You stepped in dog shit.’ 
‘You smell like poop.’ ‘You stepped in poop.’”
Pepe remembers the relentless voices well. He 
was trying to make a purchase and count out exact 
change. But his headset was playing a looping re­
cording of three or four voices, speaking at differ­
ent volumes, sometimes overlapping one another. 
It was, he said, the part of his CIT training 
that most affected him. The exercise gives officers 
a sense of what someone on the street might be 
experiencing when they say, “The voices told me 
to do this.” Each officer heard a different set of 
voices, echoing a different set of insults. By the 
end of the exercise, none of them held the correct 
amount of money. “You are literally like looking 
at your shoe, like, ‘What, are you serious?’” he re­
calls. “You literally just got so confused with all 
the different things that were goin’ on.”
The experience “doesn’t make a social worker 
out of them by any means,” Pyers says. “But it 
really gives them insight. We teach them to rec­
ognize symptoms and say, ‘Oh, okay, this person 
is obviously hearing things that I’m not hearing
