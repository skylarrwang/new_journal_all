UNDER NEW HAVEN’S MUNICIPAL ID LAW, RESIDENTS CAN APPLY FOR AN ID AT THE OF­FICE OF VITAL STATISTICS AT CITY HALL WITHOUT PROOF OF IMMIGRATION STATUS.

person Sarah Barr said the bank is limited in 
the types of identification it can use, because it 
is a national bank that requires permission from 
federal regulators. 

An employee at Citizens Bank who asks to re­
main anonymous tells me that residents come in 
once or twice a month requesting to open an ac­
count with the municipal ID. “I wish I could take 
it. I get so many people who come in and that’s 
all they’ve got,” he says, but a manager explains 
that the bank’s policy is based on “government-
issued IDs”—and apparently New Haven’s does 
not make the cut.

Chase, Wells Fargo, and Sovereign Bank will 
take the card as a secondary form of ID. First Ni­
agara spokesperson Karen Crane said the bank 
would also take it “on an exception basis,” when 
New Haven residents who are applying for bank­
ing services do not have other approved forms of 
identification and if the bank manager approves 
it. She cannot guarantee the same outcome in 
every case. 

The murkiness of banks’ policies leads to 
confusion among residents and means that fewer 
of them end up opening accounts. According to 
the 2012 JUNTA report, residents in the organi­
zation’s focus groups were more likely to try to 
open accounts at big-name banks, which means 
that some may have been denied accounts simply 
for turning to the wrong bank. (Start Community 
Bank, for example, had had only 148 people open 
accounts using the Elm City Resident ID as of 
August of this year.) Only 48 percent of people 
surveyed reported having a bank account, and 27 
percent stated that they used no financial services, 
including credit cards, prepaid cards, or check-
cashing. Residents who could not open bank ac­
counts because they lacked proper identification 
or because they didn’t understand the identifica­
tion requirements were left without a safe, reliable 
way to manage their money. 

Beyond the banks, only some local businesses 
accept the card as photo documentation. In a 2012 
study titled “Documenting the Undocumented,” 
three Yale students concluded that Latinos were 
more likely than whites to be carded when paying 
with a check. However, stores were more likely to 
accept Ameracard—an unofficial ID, from a com­
pany based in Stamford that can be purchased on­
line without proof of one’s identity—than the Elm 
City Resident ID. The problem, the researchers 
reported, was largely the municipal ID’s amateur­
ish design and unofficial-sounding name. 

If New Haven wants people to renew their ID 
cards, it will have to convince them that the card 
is a useful investment of time and money. At pres­
ent, people lack information about its processing, 
and banks’ and businesses’ unwillingness to par­
ticipate makes the card ineffective. 

Luis Alberto Lopez, another New Haven resi­
dent, tells me that ten members of his extended 
family have the card, but it hasn’t helped them


much. Bank of America turned 
it down when he attempted 
to open a bank account, and 
Walmart and Comcast refused 
to accept it as photo ID when 
he tried to make credit-card 
payments several years ago. A 
policeman in North Branford 
stopped a car he was a passen­
ger in and asked about the ID, 
“Where did you get this one?” 
“As soon as I realized that no­
body takes it, I realized that I 
better use my passport,” Lopez 
says, referring to his Mexican 
documentation.

Another immigrant couple 
Mallma introduces me to says 
that neither of them has the 
card, though they have been 
living in New Haven for eight 
years. The man tells me that the 
consular ID he uses marks him 
as a foreigner, so the Elm City 
ID would probably be good to 
have. But his wife states they 
did not have much information 
about it earlier, and now she can­
not apply because her passport 
is expired. Their answers about 
the card are, in many ways, half-
hearted; they alternate between 
lukewarm positivity and verbal 
shoulder-shrugging. After a pro­
longed conversation, the man 
concludes that there is no real 
difference between the munici­
pal ID and the consular one: “I 
don’t get a better job if I have 
the card. It neither betters nor 
worsens life. It’s the same.” 

The municipal ID has cer­
tainly helped some New Haven 
residents, but with mediocre re­
views and little current publicity, 
current residents may not hear 
about the benefits in the years to 
come. And the 2014 changeover 
in the city’s administration intro­
duced a new set of officials who 
were not around for the exten­
sive community discussions that 
led to the creation of the card. 

Though Laurence Grotheer, the 
new mayor’s communications 
director, tells me that the city is 
still considering adding a debit 
function to the card, he adds 
that there is no real timetable 
for such a change. Instead, he 
points to another city project, 
the Shop•Dine•Park gift card, 
released in January 2014, which 
can be loaded with money to 
serve as a debit card at parking 
meters or to make purchases at 
more than two hundred partici­
pating local businesses—as the 
flagship ID card never could.  

At present, seemingly more 
legitimate forms of identifica­
tion also threaten the success of 
the New Haven card. Starting in 
2015, undocumented immigrants 
will be able to obtain Connecti­
cut drivers’ licenses, though 
they will be marked “for driving 
purposes only” on the back and 
will have to be renewed every 
three years. 

Emily Tucker, an attorney 
for immigrant rights and racial 
justice at the Brooklyn-based 
Center for Popular Democracy, 
says that New Haven’s work still 
serves as a model for the rest of 
the country, where municipal 
ID’s are the focus of many peo­
ple’s efforts. The center has been 
one of the groups instrumental 
in developing the legislation in 
New York, after conducting a 
comprehensive review of the 
nation’s municipal ID card pro­
grams. “New Haven was at the 
forefront, so all of the lessons 
learned from that campaign, we 
knew they were going to come 
up for us too,” she says. But they 
also took into account the card’s 
shortcomings.

Theoretically, a municipal 
ID could offer even more advan­
tages than a DMV-issued card or 
a Shop•Dine•Park card. Where 
the city has failed—in getting an 
official-looking design and offer­
ing discounts to card users—cit­
ies such as San Francisco and 
Oakland have succeeded.

In New York City, where the 
undocumented population con­
sists of about 500,000 people, 
some of the key concerns raised 
at the start of the Elm City ID 
program and those in other 
cities are being revisited on a 
larger scale. Questions remain 
about why New York City will 
keep copies of applicants’ docu­
ments—such as pay stubs or 
children’s educational records—


for at least two years. The New 
York Civil Liberties Union re­
fused to support the legisla­
tion because of concerns that 
the police department, FBI, or 
Department of Homeland Se­
curity could force the city to 
turn over the records without 
probable cause. 

There is still a vocal group of 
Americans opposed to measures 
that are so openly supportive 
of immigrant groups, and these 
voices exacerbate the worries 
of the population now gingerly 
approaching new forms of iden­
tification. William Gheen, the 
president of the Americans for 
Legal Immigration PAC, states 
that New Haven is still a sign of 
the federal government’s terrible 
willingness to turn a blind eye 
to the “illegals” in the country. 
When the card was first released, 
his group distributed bilingual 
pamphlets in forty states with 
the instructions: “Come to New 
Haven CT for sanctuary. Bring 
your friends and family mem­
bers quickly.” His opinion has 
changed little since 2007, when 
anti-immigrant groups such as 
the Yankee Patriot Association, 
Southern Connecticut Citizens 
for Immigration Reform, and 
the Community Watchdog Proj­
ect protested against the card. 
“It sends a clear message to en­
courage illegal aliens to enter 
the United States,” he says.  

DeStefano, 
the 
former 
mayor, is not blind to the city’s 
failure to build a complete sup­
port structure for the immigrant 
population. But he slips out of 
the precision of policy makers 
into the language of an idealist 
when I ask why he still believes 
that the country will come to 
embrace its immigrants: “There 
is an American identity that 
does value freedom and does 
respect hard work and does 
value choice and does respect 
decency,” he says. 

Even if New Haven’s mu­
nicipal ID card still needs some 
work to be effectively inte­
grated into the political, social, 
and economic life of the city, it 
outlined a process to help resi­
dents considered “illegal,” allow­
ing other cities to learn from 
the Elm City’s successes and 
missteps.

Okafor, of the Community 
Services Administration, says 
expects to see Toni Harp’s ten­
ure as mayor to bring greater 
collaboration with banks, as 
per the card’s original goals. 

The summer has brought the 
early stages of planning, as she 
attempts to assess the barriers 
still in place for undocumented 
residents who have not man­
aged to open accounts. In the 
meantime, many are still in 
economic limbo.

Idealists brought the card to 
New Haven, but it remains to be 
seen whether the idea can stay 
alive—and whether programs 
like it are the right answer for 
America’s undocumented. “We 
strive for perfection. We do 
not always accomplish perfec­
tion,” DeStefano adds, before he 
leaves for work. 

IF NEW HAVEN 
WANTS PEOPLE TO 
RENEW THEIR ID 
CARDS, IT WILL 
HAVE TO CONVINCE 
THEM THAT THE 
CARD IS A USEFUL 
INVESTMENT OF 
TIME AND MONEY.
