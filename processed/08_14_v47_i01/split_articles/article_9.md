Chevy’s last visible Yale parking permit expired on 
May 28, 2012. Another five vehicles appear simi­
larly abandoned in the garage. Some of the cars I 
found did not have any sort of permit altogether, 
and others had permits that expired years ago. 
Ed Bebyn, Yale’s director of parking and tran­
sit, writes in an email that “essentially, these cars 
are permitted vehicles.” That is to say: Cars that 
are parking in the garage are required to have per­
mits, so if a car is parking in the garage, it must 
have a permit. There are always some abuses, he 
adds, but a new sticker program to be implement­
ed this fall should make the few offenders com­
ply. Karen Peart, a press officer at the Office of 
Public Affairs, explained that only cars in open 
Yale lots are currently required to have stickers; 
Pierson-Sage is not an open lot, but rather a ga­
rage. The new program would extend the sticker 
requirement to Yale’s garages starting on Sept. 2. 
However, she declined a phone interview, so I nev­
er received an answer about what would happen 
to these abandoned cars. If the New York DMV 
can’t even find a record of the ’65 Dodge, I doubt 
Yale can.

In his email, Bebyn said that some of the dust-
covered cars belong to students who buy long-
term parking and just keep the cars in the garage. 
Some cars thus only appear to be abandoned. No 
conspiracy there.

But others have tires that look like they have 
not functioned in years, and their windshields do 
not display valid parking permits. One has to won­
der whether someone is really paying Yale nearly a 
hundred dollars a month to store his or her junk. 
The persistent, suspicious presence of these cards 
indicates they are low on the list of the priorities 
of the parking administration. 

Some people who pass through the garage are 
taking justice into their own hands — more ac­
curately, their own fingers. Some have wiped mes­
sages into the grime covering a few of the cars. 
The front window of a red Metro Geo: “DANG 
WASH ME PLZ.” Someone has drawn a frown, 
nose, and eyebrows on the hood. But nobody has 
taken up the task set forth by the anonymous 
complainant.

When I leave the parking garage with the em­
ployees that cold night in March, I am still search­
ing for a story. But sometimes a garage full of cars 
really is just a garage full of cars. There are no 
secret documents here — except, perhaps, those 
related to the new sticker policy. This story is full 
of actors who go half way: laypeople interested 
enough to demand cleanup but lazy enough only 
to scratch off enough dust to leave their message, 
and a parking office interested enough to promise 
amorphous change but stubborn enough to not 
explain it.

Not all mysterious parking lots will bring 
down the presidency.
