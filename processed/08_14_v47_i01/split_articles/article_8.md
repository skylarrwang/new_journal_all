rumors of a suicide by liquid nicotine injection, 
reports that e-juice shares ingredients with anti­
freeze, accusations that the industry deliberately 
markets to kids by offering flavored juices. Some 
concerns are justified, because e-juice spilled on 
skin can be fatal, certain low-quality juices are in­
deed made with toxins, and no data on the possible 
effects of second-hand smoke from e-cigarettes 
exists. But the owners of White Buffalo Vapors 
insist that they only sell high-quality, domestic, 
natural juice, and they do support certain precau­
tions, like age restrictions on purchases. For the 
most part, though, they bring a playful attitude to 
their “vapeangelism” advertising, making liberal 
use of the #VapeLife hashtag and posting tweets 
like “Our #ecigs have all been sanctified & carved 
with protection sigils. No demonic influence in 
our vapes! Enjoy PURE flavor.”


On online forums, vapers are defensive of 
their choices, calling out people they dub “ANTZ” 
(Anti Nicotine and Tobacco Zealots). They pro­
vide testimony of their improved health since 
switching from analog cigarettes, and rejection of 
perceived anti-vape “scare tactics.” But at White 
Buffalo, the wacky group of vapers I meet are 
downright friendly, eager to bring new members 
into the fold; one tells me vaping turned him into 
a hobby electrician, since he worked on his vapor­
izers, while another describes how users will fin­
ish a single bottle in the shop by smoking over 
several hours.


Chamino, an energetic man who sports a wiry 
beard and army style jacket, points out that the 
customer base for vaping is as wide as that of 
cigarettes, including everyone from “blue collar 
workers to trendy Hollywood people.” That diver­
sity brings an eclectic feel to the shop, but it may 
make it difficult to built cohesion there. Still, as 
people linger and vape, they bond over their fringe 
subculture.


They’re setting out to create a new communi­
ty and establish an industry. Vaporizers, still in the 
wild west of untested products, owe some of their 
cool to pure novelty, but the goal of the White 
Buffalo folks is to stay ahead of the herd, and cre­
ate a spot where vapers will come to stay.

knobs for the car radio. I worry 
that I will find a body inside, 
but instead I find a rusty paint 
scraper and a pair of shoelaces. 
The stuffing explodes out of the 
back seat, but I cannot locate 
the animal that has been gnaw­
ing on the fabric. The odometer 
reads 67,256, and a 1994 New 
York emissions test sticker in­
dicates the exact same mileage. 
Either the odometer is broken 
or this car was moved from New 
York to Yale’s Pierson-Sage ga­
rage two decades ago.
The New York State Depart­
ment of Motor Vehicles doesn’t 
help, but not for lack of trying. 
A license plate search returned 
no registration or inspection 
records — records are deleted 
after ten years of no activity, ac­
cording to Pete Bucci, the de­
partment’s public information 
officer. The decaying sticker 
provides the only evidence of 
this car’s strange journey.
While nobody — except 
one intrepid journalist — seems 
to have been thinking about this 
car in over a decade, parking lot 
patrons are taking note of other 
abandoned cars. On the top lev­
el of the garage sits an old pick­
up truck. Its flat tires hint that 
it hasn’t been driven in a while, 
but that hasn’t stopped people 
from using it — as a trash dump. 
Garbage litters the Chevy’s bed. 
Broken windshield wipers poke 
through a layer of plastic bottles, 
coffee cups, and rusty hubcaps. 
I can’t find the shredded docu­
ments; maybe they have already 
decomposed.
Someone has stuck a note 
underneath the windshield wip­
er that reads, “Is this truck for 
sale? If so, let me know.” I give 
Bill, the man who left the note, 
a call. He says that he noticed 
the pickup in July 2013, because 
his son has an identical one that 
needed some spare parts. Now, 
at the end of August, he hasn’t 
received a call back. When I re­
turn to the garage, the note is 
gone, but the truck remains.
It’s unclear why the truck 
hasn’t 
been 
removed.

nder the cover of darkness, 
we drive into the Pierson-
Sage parking garage, just north 
of Yale’s Science Hill. It is night­
time in mid-March. Two recent 
graduates, now Yale employees, 
promise a juicy story. I can’t help 
but think of the scene in “All 
the President’s Men” when Bob 
Woodward coaxes the Water­
gate story out of an informant in 
a parking garage in Washington, 
D.C. But our target that night is 
not a national scandal (though I 
still kept my hopes up); it is an 
unlikely fleet of abandoned cars.
“Welcome to the graveyard 
of elephants,” one of the Yale 
employees says as we descended 
into the bowels of the garage. 
We creep up on a handful of 
tarp-covered cars, vaguely re­
sembling sleeping pachyderms. 
Upon closer inspection, three or 
four of the cars appear luxurious 
enough to belong in someone’s 
private collection. One stands 
out from the crowd.
The 1965 Dodge is so old 
that it has sliders instead of
