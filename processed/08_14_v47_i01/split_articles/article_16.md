emerging on the market at the same time, were 
thought effective enough to quiet anxiety, depres­
sion, bipolar disorder, and psychosis—many of the 
most severe syndromes that had originally forced 
states to institutionalize individuals. Civil com­
mitment laws around the nation were reformed 
so that only the most severely mentally ill—those 
who posed an immediate threat to themselves or 
to others—could be hospitalized against their will. 


At the same time, state budgets were shrink­
ing, and state hospitals were a prime target for 
cuts. By the turn of the century, the number of 
beds per 100,000 people had fallen to twenty. 
Dwindling funds, moreover, meant that states 
were not financially equipped to build the com­
prehensive, community-based mental healthcare 
systems necessary to care for people who had been 
discharged from hospitals.

Connecticut has one of the nation’s most 
well-funded and well-managed mental healthcare 
systems. Even so, says Madelon Baranoski, an as­
sociate professor of Law and Psychiatry at Yale’s 
School of Medicine who teaches a module of CA­
BLE’s CIT training course, not enough services 
have sprung up to provide the care once offered 
in hospitals. Consequently, many people with se­
vere mental illness are left to their own devices, 
encountering mental health professionals only in 
times of crisis. Public health officials liken this ne­
glect to only treating a patient with heart disease 
once he has suffered a heart attack—ignoring a se­
rious problem until it becomes a crisis.

Nearly every day, police departments across 
Connecticut receive phone calls from families 
where one member with mental illness is in crisis; 
the callers fear either for the ill family member’s 
safety or for their own. In addition, in the state’s 
urban centers—cities like Hartford, Bridgeport, 
and New Haven—many homeless residents suf­
fer from mental illness, wandering the city streets 
talking to themselves, disconnected from any 
available mental health resources. New Haven, 
in particular, has an especially large population 
of people with mental illness, largely because of 
its Yale-affiliated hospitals and its abundance of 
group-living homes.

Sgt. Chris McKee, an officer with the Windsor 
Police Department who has taught CIT courses 
for four years, says that, in general, police are not 
adequately taught to recognize signs of mental ill­
ness. “It’s our job to get a scene safe,” he says. “But 
we can’t run into a house with a bipolar person 
and put our hands on their shoulders and force 
them to sit down. They are going to pace. They 
are going to get up and fidget and feel anxious. 
When the police tell them to do something, they 
don’t always listen.” In cases like these, McKee 
says, officers may arrest—or even shoot—the in­
dividual because they do not recognize his or 
her uncooperative behavior as a manifestation of 
mental illness.

CIT training attempts to prevent these situ­
ations by teaching police officers to recognize 
symptoms of mental illness and to use techniques 
that will calm people in crisis. What you need, 
Pepe says, is sensitivity: sensitivity in what tone 
you take, sensitivity in which words you choose, 
sensitivity in your physical interactions. Such an 
approach, proponents of CIT hope, reduces the 
risk of injury to both police officers and individu­
als with mental illness, diverting those individuals 
to mental health treatment instead of jail.

“Police have learned that the command pres­
ence that they use—usually with the bad guy or 
the robber—that command presence, yelling, be­
ing really forceful, doesn’t work with people with 
mental illness,” says Louise Pyers, the founder and 
executive director of CABLE. “It makes it worse. 
So if they can identify, ‘Here is someone who 
clearly has a mental illness,’ they can come in a lot 
slower, be a lot less threatening, speak softly, ask 
questions in a non-threatening way.”

Pepe, a burly, dark-haired teddy bear of a man, 
is the perfect guy for the job. He can be gruff 
when a situation warrants it, but, for the most 
part, he is soft-spoken and jovial. As we drive in 
his cruiser, he listens to pop music and chats about 
his two kids. His speech, tinged with a mild Bos­
ton accent, is frequently punctuated with short, 
loud belly laughs. When we pass by other offi­
cers, he rolls down his window and shouts their 
nicknames. Though he wears a gun on his hip, 
and he has warned me that violence could come 
around any corner, I feel strangely safe sitting by 
his side. Perhaps it’s the unending banter. “I like 
talking to people,” he tells me over the whirs and 
beeps from the cruiser’s radio. “I have no problem 
talking to pretty much anyone.” (That’s good, be­
cause I’ve been in his passenger seat for close to 
seven hours.)

Pepe tells me that his CIT training, which he 
completed two years ago, has primarily taught 
him to slow down and use conversation as a way of 
making others feel comfortable. “You get sent to 
a call like, ‘guy standing in the middle of the street 
yellin’ and screamin’,’ you have no idea—you don’t 
want to put yourself in a situation to have that 
yelling and screaming become a fight between you 
and him.”

“That’s where I think some of the CIT stuff 
comes out,” he continues. “‘What’s going on, 
how are ya’, what’s your name, where do you live?’ 
You’re not gonna yell and scream at him, ‘Get out 
of the road! I’m gonna lock ya up!’” The latter kind 
of interaction, he says, can even act as a trigger for 
mental health crises. 

Once Pepe has won someone over, it’s easier to 
convince him or her to go to the hospital without 
putting up a fight. After talking for long enough, 
some people even choose to go voluntarily. In cas­
es where Pepe has been called to mediate, but de­
cides that hospitalization is not necessary, he can 
pass the individual’s name along to New Haven’s 
CIT clinician, based at the Connecticut Mental 
Health Center. She can then follow up to connect 
the individual with mental health services.

Proponents of the CIT model emphasize that 
it expands a police officer’s range of options. Pepe 
says that, in some situations, he doesn’t have much 
choice. When he is called to a situation involving 
domestic violence, for example, Connecticut law 
requires him to make an arrest. But CIT teaches 
officers, in the words of Amy Watson, an associ­
ate professor at the University of Illinois at Chi­
cago’s Jane Addams College of Social Work, “not 
to arrest for stupid stuff”—charges like “disor­
derly conduct,” when a person’s symptoms cause 
them to behave in disruptive, but not necessarily 
criminal, ways.

That doesn’t let people with mental illness 
off the hook for all crimes. “Certainly,” Watson 
tells me, “if you have a mental illness, it doesn’t 
mean that you shouldn’t be arrested if you steal 
something. But if your voices are telling you 
to steal something, maybe arrest isn’t the most 
productive avenue.”

In 1988, police in Memphis, Tennessee shot a 
27-year-old man named Joseph Dewayne Robin­
son. Robinson was in the midst of a mental health 
crisis at the time, cutting himself with a knife 
and threatening suicide. The officers repeatedly 
ordered him to drop the knife, but he only grew 
more agitated, moving toward the officers. They 
shot him eight times.

A public outcry surrounding Robinson’s death 
led the Memphis Police Department and research­
ers at the University of Memphis to collaborate on 
a program that would teach officers how to inter­
act more humanely with the mentally ill. Before 
CIT, patrol officers used to ask separate mental 
health experts to join them on calls requiring psy­
chiatric training. But each police department’s 
fleet of mental health professionals was small—if 
they could afford one at all.

CIT helps rank-and-file members to add these 
skills to their repertoire. (At least 2,600 local de­
partments currently have CIT-trained officers on 
the ground, according to the University of Mem­
phis’s estimate.) In New Haven, elements of the 
CIT model have been incorporated into the initial 
training that all patrol officers receive, and the de­
partment is attempting to send as many officers as 
it can afford to CABLE’s training courses. “I think 
it’s just an extra tool you use when you’re on the 
street,” Pepe says. “I think it’s for everyone.”

The numbers prove that Pepe’s success in 
the scene I witnessed wasn’t just an anomaly. In 
2002, Dr. Randy Dupont, a professor of crimi­
nology and criminal justice at the University of 
Memphis, oversaw a project that tracked 1,200 
individuals with serious mental illnesses who en­
gaged with law enforcement officials during that 
year, to gauge CIT’s effectiveness in Memphis. 
Six hundred had interacted with CIT-trained of­
ficers, while another six hundred had encountered 
untrained officers. Dupont and his colleagues only 
tracked individuals who were directly connected 
to community services and individuals who were 
sent to jail but soon diverted back into community 
services, so as Dupont puts it, “their paths con­
verged very quickly.” Not only did the research­
ers find that CIT-trained officers were much less 
likely to send mentally ill individuals to jail than 
their untrained counterparts, they also found that 
mentally ill individuals who had briefly been ex­
posed to the jail environment were less likely to 
see an improvement in their psychiatric symp­
toms three months later, less likely to remain in 
treatment, and more likely to be rearrested. Du­
pont’s research, along with scores of other studies 
coming out of Memphis, encouraged other cities 
and states to consider the CIT model.

Just as the death of Joseph Dewayne Robinson 
spurred unprecedented collaboration between the 
police department and the mental health system 
in Memphis, an unexpected run-in with law en­
forcement was the catalyst that led Pyers to bring 
the Memphis model to Connecticut. In 1997, her 
son Seth, whose name has been changed in this 
story, was a 19-year-old engineering student at a 
university in New Jersey. Soon after entering col­
lege, Seth was diagnosed with Major Depressive 
Disorder and prescribed anti-depressants. Ev­
ery month, he would drive up to his hometown 
in central Connecticut for a routine visit with his 
psychiatrist. One morning that spring, Pyers was 
awoken early by a phone call. An officer from the 
local police department informed her that Seth 
had been shot in the stomach by an officer in the 
middle of the night.

Pyers was confused: Her son had come home 
for a doctor’s appointment just several weeks 
prior, and he was not due back home for several 
more. Seth was no longer a minor, so his psychia­
trist could not have informed Pyers that her son 
had recently taken an emotional nosedive. Seth 
had attempted to take his own life by swallow­
ing an entire bottle of over-the-counter painkill­
ers. When that effort failed—“All it did was make 
him sick,” Pyers recalls—he began thinking about 
other, more fail-proof methods. 

The evening before Pyers received the phone 
call, Seth had decided his surest option would be 
to use a gun. But he did not own one, and neither, 
he knew, did his parents. Then it occurred to him: 
Police carry guns. 

So that night, he clambered into his car, sped 
to Connecticut, and led several police officers on a 
car chase. In an effort to end the encounter quick­
ly, he rear-ended one of the cop cars. The officer 
Seth had rammed got out of his car, and Seth ran 
toward him shouting, “You better shoot me, or I’ll
