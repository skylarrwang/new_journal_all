continue to sign up are indeed 
the immigrants who stand to 
benefit most from it, the card 
may have achieved some of 
its goals. Martha Okafur, who 
started as Community Services 
Administrator in June, said her 
department is in the process of 
assessing what still needs to be 
done to help the unbanked, and 
plans to discuss with banks their 
reluctance to accept the card. 
But without the data, the only 
way to find out what’s really go­
ing on is to speak to members of 
the community. 

Ten years ago, chances are 
that I would have been mugged 
on my bike ride to Fair Haven, 
says neighborhood resident Ru­
ben Mallma, an organizer for the 
immigrant rights group Familias 
en Camino. Crime rates in the 
area were higher back then, and 
he credits the ID for contrib­
uting to a sense of safety in his 
neighborhood.
Fair Haven, the city’s im­
migrant hub and home to thou­
sands, is the place to watch when 
following New Haven’s progress 
on immigration issues. It is dif­
ficult to obtain accurate figures, 
since undocumented individu­
als may be wary of officials who 
are collecting population statis­
tics. But according to “A City to 
Model,” approximately 3,000 
to 5,000 people in Fair Haven 
are undocumented. About half 
of the neighborhood’s popula­
tion is Latino, with people from 
Mexico, Ecuador, Peru, and sur­
rounding countries.
Mallma’s stories illustrate 
the difficult realities and daily 
problems that the ID card at­
tempted to address: Residents 
without bank accounts were of­
ten robbed, and were too fear­
ful of the police to report the 
crimes. He knew of eight peo­
ple living in a three-bedroom 
apartment in Fair Haven whose 
three-bedroom apartment was 
burglarized ten years ago but 
they did not tell police. Another 
man got off a public bus with 
the money from four paychecks 
in his pocket. He was chased by 
a thief until Mallma pulled him 
into his house. Since police were 
often not alerted about these 
crimes, they could not keep ac­
curate statistics. But newspa­
pers reported that the undocu­
mented were called “walking 
ATMs,” and people kept track 
of the situation through stories 
passed from one neighbor to 
the other.
Many of the city’s undocu­
mented have little hope of ob­
taining citizenship, unless they 
are able to marry a U.S. citizen 
or find an employer to spon­
sor them. So they find ways to 
conceal their status. Two de­
cades ago, many of the people 
Mallma knew carried fake docu­
ments.  Some had papers from 
people who were deceased in 
other states. Others used their 
IRS tax identification numbers 
instead of Social Security num­
bers. Living in the shadows, 
people couldn’t help but feel 
that they didn’t quite belong in 
“When the police knock 
on your door, or when the po­
lice stop you for driving your 
car without a driver’s license, or 
when you try to buy something 
by credit and you are denied, 
you think, ‘What am I doing 
over here?’ You, as a person, you 
are nothing,” Mallma says. 
David Hartman, the me­
dia liaison for the New Haven 
Police Department, states that 
when the Elm City Resident 
ID Card was first implemented, 
the number of burglaries and 
robberies reported in Fair Ha­
ven increased—and the police 
actually found that encourag­
ing. The change suggested that 
people were more willing to re-

port crimes. Overall crime rates 
dropped across the city in fol­
lowing years, and Hartman says 
that the ID card was part of the 
change. With more people turn­
ing to the police, “those people 
that were perpetrating these 
crimes realized that their de­
scriptions were going to be out 
there,” making it more likely 
that they would be apprehend­
ed. Indeed, crime reports for the 
county show that the robbery 
rate dropped steadily after 2007, 
while the burglary and larceny 
rates jumped by several hundred 
in 2008 and then returned to 
lower levels. However, it is all 
but impossible to determine if 
the Elm City card was the pri­
mary cause of these changes.
At a small meeting of Uni­
dad Latina members in April, 
I seat myself next to John Jairo 
Lugo, the bearded organizer 
whose name often appears in 
news articles about the latest 
immigrants’ rights protests. Uni­
dad Latina, founded in 2003, is 
the new kid on the block, as far 
as Latino rights organizations 
go; its collaborator, JUNTA, 
which also works on issues af­
fecting the Latino population, 
has been around since 1969. But 
there are still over twenty peo­
ple gathered in the long, wood-
floored room in the New Haven 
People’s Center on Howe Street. 
There is an old A.B. Chase 
piano in the corner, next to the 
whiteboard where Lugo stands 
with a dry-erase marker in hand, 
poised for discussion. The walls 
are adorned with a black-and-
white image of Rosa Parks, a 
poster commemorating “Amer­
ica’s Labor Heritage,” a paint­
ing by the Mexican artist Di­
ego Rivera, and a collection of 
children’s drawings on colored 
construction paper with mes­
sages addressed to “Dear Mayor 
Toni Harp.”  
Knowing that I came to 
hear people’s stories, Lugo turns 
to one of the other early arriv­
als and says, in Spanish, “Marco, 
you have the ID card, right?” 
When the skinny man next to 
me assents, Lugo grins: “Your 
first victim,” he says to me, be­
fore turning back to the man. 
“Only if you want to [talk], 
of course.”  
“People want the card,” 
Marco Rodriguez tells me in 
Spanish. “It’s good.” Not great, 
not life-changing. But he did use 
it to open several bank accounts. 
However, many people, he tells 
me, cannot apply for the card, 
because they do not receive 
utility bills in their name. That 
makes providing proof of resi­
dence difficult.
Lugo points to a couple 
other people as they walk in, re­
peating his question, and each 
man pulls out his card from his 
wallet and extends it toward me, 
so I can see. I know what the 
cards look like from photos, so 
I am not sure what more I am 
supposed to find printed on the 
white surfaces. It is simply a mo­
ment of proof, of providing the 
identification that was asked for.
The meeting’s agenda in­
cludes the dispute over under­
paid, undocumented workers at 
Gourmet Heaven and the cases 
of several residents who were 
arrested by ICE. As Lugo at­
tempts to rally people for a pro­
test in the following weeks, he 
tries to convince a woman in the 
back that one does not need to 
be documented to participate. 
But after her own experience 
being detained, she is afraid to 
take such a risk: “I haven’t got­
ten over the trauma,” she says.
Looking back at the 2007 
raids, New Haven’s most public 
round of deportation, it is clear 
that ICE cannot round up the 
undocumented without proper 
warrants for arrest. But it can 
entangle people in years of legal 
battles, with the threat of extra­
dition constantly hanging over 
their heads. Of the twenty im­
migrants represented by the Yale 
Law School’s Jerome N. Frank 
Legal Services Organization af­
ter the raid, all were released 
except two, and the rest decided 
to either voluntarily leave the 
U.S. or to seek outside counsel, 
according to Wishnie. When 
eleven were awarded compen­
sation of $350,000 in 2012, the 
Yale Law School reported that it 
was the “largest monetary settle­
ment ever paid by the United 
States in a suit over residential 
immigration raids, and the first 
to include both compensation 
and immigration relief.” Howev­
er, not everyone is so lucky, and 
no amount of money can take 
away the anxiety that the wom­
an at the meeting—and thou­
sands like her—live with daily.
This fear lies at the core 
of the Elm City ID’s struggles. 
Even 
when 
official 
policies 
change, people’s attitudes might 
not. The ID card arrived soon 
after another victory for immi­
grant groups; in 2006, the local 
police department ruled that 
officers cannot ask about wit­
nesses’ or victims’ immigration

status. This measure was intended to encourage 
undocumented residents to report crime; previ­
ously, if they gave their name to the police, they 
ran the risk of being matched to ICE’s national 
database. New Haven police followed officials in 
several other cities in declaring that their role was 
not to enforce federal law, but to keep the city 
safe. Last year, Connecticut as a whole took an­
other step toward curtailing ICE’s powers by be­
coming the second state to sign the TRUST Act, 
promising not to detain immigrants unless they 
are convicted of serious crimes. 
Still, a 2012 report by JUNTA and the Trans­
national Development Clinic at the Yale Law 
School stated that there is still “widespread suspi­
cion” among Fair Haven residents about the resi­
dent ID card. Rumors persist, the report noted, 
that the card is solely for people who did not have 
papers or that federal officials will use it to detain 
undocumented workers. Okafor, the Community 
Services Administrator, says that until her staff 
starts meeting with focus groups and conducting 
interviews in September, they cannot know the 
community’s current attitudes toward the card. 
Anecdotes are, for now, the only evidence.
The card hopes to make residents feel safer in 
their community, but after past run-ins with the 
local police, some residents remain wary. After the 
meeting, Abel Sanchez, who has lived in New Ha­
ven for fourteen years, tells me that a policeman 
stopped him three years ago while driving—“I 
knew it was racist,” he says—and did not accept 
the card. It is useful as an identification document 
when dealing with the city’s trash collection ser­
vices, he adds. But he doesn’t have much more to 
say about it, and he knows of only a few friends 
who have one.
Domingo Lopez, who has lived in New Haven 
for twenty-two years, tells me the ID is important 
here. He uses it at businesses and hospitals, and 
he has even opened a bank account. But he has 
also had problems with the police, even during the 
time he has had the card: “They see that you’re 
Latino, and they bad-mouth you,” he says. How­
ever, when I ask him for more details, he tells me 
that his last problem with a policeman was five 
years ago. 
Latrina Kelly-James, the deputy director for 
Development & Programs at JUNTA, says the 
people she works with understand that ICE and 
local police operate independently, and that the 
municipal ID has helped give residents a sense of 
pride in New Haven. “The card makes them feel 
part of the city and makes them feel civically en­
gaged,” she says. 
However, the card is ineffective beyond city 
limits, where they may face other threats. In 2010, 
after being sued by residents, the city of East 
Haven was found guilty of repeatedly harassing 
Latinos. The city paid a $450,000 settlement in 
June 2014, but residents are still uneasy outside 
New Haven.
 “When you have a welcoming city and two 
blocks down, you have a fear of being deported, 
that sense of fear is always going to be there,” 
Kelly-James notes. 
Back in the People’s Center, Lugo asks a man 
who was released after being detained for eight 
months to come speak at the front of the room. 
As the man tells it, he was on his way to buy a sand­
wich when the police stopped him and sent him 
to immigration services. Lugo pulls out a mailing 
envelope and, with a flourish, hands the man at 
the front of the room his own United States Em­
ployment Authorization Card. “You can get Social 
Security, and a driver’s license,” Lugo tells him, 
and the man looks genuinely moved as he holds 
the card in his hand, until someone shouts from 
the back, “You can pay taxes, too!” Lugo takes a 
photo of the man holding up the card as he poses 
at the front of the room. 
Documentation is coveted in this community. 
Even though the national card is just a temporary 
work permit, it is prized. And it grants far more 
privileges than New Haven’s local ID ever will.  
The Elm City ID can help holders accomplish 
everyday tasks, but it only works if city organiza­
tions and companies accept it. Liberty Bank and 
Start Community Bank, both local banks, accept 
the card as a primary form of identification from 
people who wish to open a bank account. But, de­
spite DeStefano’s early efforts, many of the city’s 
largest banks do not. 
TD Bank, People’s United Bank, and Web­
ster Bank do not accept the card as identifica­
tion when opening an account. Webster spokes-
