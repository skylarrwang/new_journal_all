CIT training has taught Pepe to be on the 
lookout for these symptoms in people on the 
street—not just in the people he encounters dur­
ing calls. He says that as he drives, his head is al­
ways “on a swivel.” Many symptoms, he adds, are 
very easy to pick up. Patterns emerge: If someone 
is about to do something violent, he or she will of­
ten grind his or her teeth or tense his or her hands 
into fists. If someone is about to take off running, 
he or she will often first pull his or her pants higher 
on the waist. If someone is using drugs, he or she 
might be yelling in the street or sitting on a curb 
looking dazed.

But, Pepe emphasizes, he can quickly gain 
a much better understanding of what exactly is 
troubling someone just by chatting with them. “A 
majority of people are willing to talk. You just have 
to find that area that lets them open up.”

The research conducted on CIT training so far 
has proven promising but inconclusive. The 2002 
Memphis study results were an early indication of 
the program’s potential, and the most recent stud­
ies suggest that CIT-trained officers arrest fewer 
people with mental illness and connect more with 
the mental health services they need. But existing 
data have not necessarily borne out the claim that 
CIT-trained officers use less force than their non-
trained counterparts. Researchers have also not 
been able to determine whether a change in of­
ficers’ attitudes about mental illness significantly 
impacts their choices on the job. 

“We have a reasonable level of confidence that 
[CIT training] can improve safety in encounters 
and probably increase the number of people that 
officers connect to services,” Watson, the Univer­
sity of Illinois professor, tells me. But, she cau­
tions that these effects are only moderate. “A lot 
of officers who aren’t CIT-trained [already] do a 
fairly decent job—they learn what works.”

Pyers says that these findings mirror what she 
has observed in Connecticut so far. Officers are 
often required to arrest individuals with mental 
illness, especially if their crimes do not result di­
rectly from their symptoms. But, in the past de­
cade, many others have been transported to the 
hospital for evaluations or connected to existing 
services instead of being charged for a crime their 
illness led them to commit. And, whereas officers 
may have arrested a person with mental illness on 
a petty crime like breach of peace before the CIT 
model was implemented, they are now more likely 
to understand that such an individual would be 
better off in treatment than in jail. 

Meckel, the state official who oversees the 
DMHAS grants that fund CABLE’s CIT training 
courses, says that the state cannot truly measure 
the CIT model’s success because it lacks sufficient 
data to do so. “The police are not in the busi­
ness of doing these cost-benefit analyses,” Meckel 
tells me. “We can think of a lot of numbers that 
would be useful to have, but it’s not what the po­
lice usually collect.” It might be helpful to know, 
for example, the number of people diverted from 
the criminal justice system and instead connected 
with mental health services. But even if the police 
were able to track the number of people diverted 
into public programs, they would not be able to 
track those who have private insurance and seek 
help through their own providers.

“The difficulty of all of this work is that you 
can’t say you prevented something,” Baranos­
ki says. “You can collect data over time and say, 
‘O.K., maybe we’ve made fewer arrests.’” But a lot 
of factors can influence that statistic.

Still, by Meckel’s estimation, funding CA­
BLE’s CIT training program turns out to be cost-
effective for the state. Assuming that CIT-trained 
officers prevent even a handful of individuals with 
mental illness from entering the criminal justice 
system, he says, the state is likely to save money. 
Even when the state pays for community-based 
services including psychiatrists, psychologists, 
case managers, rental subsidies, and hospitaliza­
tions, these costs add up to a fraction of the yearly 
“IT’S A SAD COMMENTARY 
ON THE STATE OF MENTAL 
HEALTH SERVICES. THE POLICE 
ARE STEPPING UP TO DO IT, 
BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE WILL.”


Watson takes a much more pessimistic view. 
No one, she says, says it’s a terrible idea to train 
officers in the principles of CIT. But, she adds, 
the fact that police must take on such a burden 
speaks to just how inadequate the American men­
tal healthcare system has become.
 “It’s a sad commentary on the state of mental 
health services. The police are stepping up to do 
it, because no one else will.”

Near the end of my ride with Officer Pepe, I 
ask him if he thinks CIT is effective. He remains 
silent for an uncharacteristically long time, con­
templating his answer. Finally, he responds, “You 
know, I think about it all the time. I sent this guy 
to the hospital two weeks ago. Did it help? What’d 
it do? We don’t really know those things, you 
know? I mean, we kind of are just the first step.”

cost of sending a person with severe mental ill­
ness to prison. For example, according to a 2008 
study conducted by the Connecticut Office of 
Legislative Research, the cost per individual at the 
Garner Correctional Institution, a state prison in 
Newtown that housed mainly inmates with men­
tal illness at the time of the study, was $85,000 per 
year. By contrast, the average cost of incarceration 
across the state stood at $40,000. And when an 
individual successfully reintegrates into his or her 
community, it also becomes more possible for that 
individual to find work, require less financial sup­
port, and contribute to the economy.

Cost effectiveness aside, Meckel believes the 
CIT model offers Connecticut other, intangible 
benefits. It has, in his judgment, helped people 
with mental illness come to trust the police. “We 
want people with serious mental illnesses—who 
are much more likely to be the victim than the 
perpetrator of a crime—we want them to feel 
comfortable going to the police,” Meckel says. 
“The more positive interactions they have with 
police officers, the more likely that is to happen.”
