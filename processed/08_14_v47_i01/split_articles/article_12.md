He sounds like a lawyer explain­
ing the facts of a case he knows 
he will win. And he feels that the 
Common Core standards are 
a key step in moving American 
education forward. “It’s the first 
attempt in this country to have 
anything that resembles a na­
tional conversation about what 
our students should be able 
to know, understand, or do,” 
he explained.  

Architects of the Core, along 
with their supporters, think that 
every American child should be 
taught how to think critically 
rather than spend time memo­
rizing formulaic strategies for 
taking standardized tests. That 
means that teachers will have to 
make fundamental changes in 
the way they teach. But they do 
have the new guidelines to point 
them in the right direction. For 
example, reading and writing are 
now supposed to take a more 
central place in every class. 
“When you start to become 
departmentalized in the older 
grades, teachers start to become 
very territorial about what their 
content is and what they do,” 
Canalori said. “[But] the Com­
mon Core says very clearly that 
everyone is a literacy teacher.” 
To make that a reality, she is 
helping her colleagues under­
stand how best to teach differ­
ent kinds of writing across sub­
ject areas. Now, in science class, 
students learn argumentative 
writing based on observations of 
experiments, while social stud­
ies lessons include persuasive 
writing based on data collection.
Under the Core, students 
also need to be able to read and 
analyze a wider variety of liter­
ary genres, and the Fair Haven 
School’s library shelves show it: 
Both nonfiction survival narra­
tives and Sharon Draper young 
adult novels exploring the lives 
of urban teenagers expose stu­
dents to a variety of genres and 
satisfy Common Core require­
ments. In math, Howe said, stu­
dents develop a stronger sense 
of numbers, acquiring a more 
intuitive understanding of how, 
say, place value works. They fo­
cus on fewer concepts, but delve 
more deeply into each one. 
Before the Common Core, 
Canalori says, teachers often 
gave students “formulas” for 
answering different categories 
of questions on state assess­
ments. “We have all these pas­
sive learners now. I think that 
the Common Core is going to 
take that away, because we don’t 
know what the kids are going to 
be asked,” Canalori said. In the 
past, teachers knew what type 
of essay their students would 
be asked to write: Fourth grade 
wrote narrative, fifth expository, 
seventh and eighth persuasive. 
Now, the test is unpredictable. 
Students need to be trained in 
many different kinds of writing, 
because the old formulas will 
not work on test day. 
Canalori knows that that 
these tests are going to be a 
challenge. “The test is really 
hard. I firmly believe that teach­
ers should have high expecta­
tions and that children rise to 
the expectations you set for 
them, and I’ve lived that in my 
career as a teacher. But the test 
is really difficult and I personally 
wonder if it’s developmentally 
appropriate.”
The already-difficult tests, 
she says, are made even tougher 
by the fact that they are taken 
on the computer. When I visited 
her at school, her students were 
busy practicing their computer 
skills, clicking away on desktops 
in the school library, building 
websites based on what they’d 
read about natural disasters. “I 
worry about their personal tech 
skills, but also I worry that we 
are somewhat behind in our 
technology 
infrastructure 
in 
the building and now we’re kind 
of running to play catch up,” 
Canalori said. Some schools sim­
ply have better equipment: Her 
son’s school in the suburbs sup­
plies every student with an iPad, 
integrating technological litera­
cy into everyday activities, but 
in Fair Haven, computers are 
often older models. But that’s 
changing: The school has re­
ceived donated computers, and 
a state grant is helping schools 
across the New Haven district 
buy thousands more, largely in­
tended to help students take 
the tests.
Marlin Coon, a sandy-haired 
student at the K-8 Worthington 
Hooker School in East Rock, 
took the test last spring, at the 
end of his third-grade year. He 
found that it was a little harder 
than tests he had taken previ­
ously, mainly because of the 
technology component. “I didn’t 
know what all the keys were. 
Plus writing is much faster than 
typing,” he said, swinging his 
legs while sitting next to his fa­
ther at a local coffee shop. 
Parent Dave Coon, PTA 
president 
at 
Worthington 
Hooker, voices a different con­
cern. He and his fellow parents 
are worried that excessive test­
ing will negatively impact their 
children’s education by forc­
ing teachers to spend instruc­
tional time coaching students 
for tests. And, at Worthington 
Hooker, where Coon’s two sons 
attend school, testing occupied 
the school’s computers and shut 
down its library for two months. 


Many parents report that 
even homework doesn’t look like 
it used to.Carol Boynton, a sec­
ond-grade teacher at Edgewood 
School, said that many parents, 
unable to understand their chil­
dren’s homework, have asked her 
what’s so terrible about teaching 
math the “normal” way. She rec­
ognizes that these new standards 
cause anxiety for parents. “I see 
a lot of frustrated parents react­
ing,” she said. “And I understand 
that.” She tries to explain that 
“some of this [material] has been 
around forever. It’s not really 
new. It’s just being formatted in 
a new way.” 

Roger Howe, a Yale math 
professor who helped design 
the new standards in math, ex­
plained that the national stan­
dards are just that—standards. 
While the tests are adminis­
tered nationwide, states and 
districts are left to design their 
own curricula. Three and a half years 
ago, the New Haven Unified 
School District replaced the 
previous math curriculum with 
Singapore math, which empha­
sizes independent problem solv­
ing to guide students towards 
discovering concepts and for­
mulas instead of memorizing 
them. And two years ago, they 
introduced the reading curricu­
lum designed in part by Canalo­
ri. In this sense, Common Core 
standards aren’t so new after all, 
and New Haven’s classrooms 
are already moving in the right 
direction. “It’s new for the rest 
of the state, it’s new for most of 
the country…but it isn’t for us,” 
Torre said.
This early adaptation sets 
New Haven apart from other 
states and districts because it 
has given students, and most 
importantly, teachers, time to 
adjust to and understand the 
new methods. Howe believes 
this head start has prepared 
New Haven students “in a pret­
ty significant way,” making the 
difference between a successful 
rollout and a failed one. 

But every teacher, in every 
classroom, in every school, still 
needs to be prepared to meet 
the standards. “The essential 
thing for the Common Core, 
or really any kind of curriculum 
innovation, is that you have to 
make sure teachers are ready to 
do it,” Howe said. “And this is 
what the U.S. education system 
chronically fails to do.” A survey 
conducted by Education Week 
in October 2013 found that 
teachers spent fewer than four 
days in Common Core training 
for both subjects. New Haven is 
hardly an exception and does not 
have many programs in place to 
provide teachers with opportu­
nities for professional develop­
ment and training to teach the 
Common Core.
The most promising pro­
gram available—the Yale-New 
Haven Teachers Institute—is 
facilitated and funded by Yale, 
rather than by the city or the 
state. The seminars, which work 
with teachers to develop inno­
vative curricula that they then 
post online, target Common 
Core strategies, because that’s 
what teachers are most inter­
ested in learning about. But they 
are not certified by any oversee­
ing organization.
Founding 
Director 
of 
the Institute Jim Vivian sees 
teacher support as a weakness 
of the rollout both nationally 
and in New Haven. He knows 
that his workshops only reach 
a handful of teachers, and even 
the lesson plans that they pro­
duce and publish for free on­
line can only provide so much 
support. He worries that not 
enough similar programs exist 
to support teachers through the 
transition process. 

Boynton attended her first 
seminar at YNHTI in 2007. She 
continues to attend the program 
and use the online resources, and 
she encourages her colleagues 
to do the same. “It’s what we 
need as teachers. It’s an experi­
ence that teachers can have that 
will provide them with the tools 
they need to approach the Com­
mon Core,” she explained.
At both Fair Haven and 
Edgewood, students and teach­
ers await results from the pilot 
round of SBAC testing. Scores 
from the pilot will not be used 
to make decisions about individ­
ual students’ placement or per­
formance, but they will provide 
a general indication of how the 
district might perform once the 
final version of the test is admin­
istered next year. 

Boynton feels a little more 
hopeful about the results that 
Edgewood School will receive 
this year. It was one of a few New 
Haven schools that participated 
in an earlier round of SBAC pi­
lot testing in 2013, and her an­
swer suggests that the tests are 
not to be feared. “Because we’ve 
been ahead of it a little bit, we’ve 
done it, we know a lot about 
what has to occur— not every­
thing, but we have some ideas. I 
don’t think the anxiety is as high 
as it is in other places.”
Educators hope the Com­
mon Core standards will better 
serve their students. But, ulti­
mately, many encourage their 
students to look beyond the 
test. “I work at a school where 
the philosophy is that you are 
much more than a test score,” 
Leslie Blatteau, a high school 
history teacher at Metropolitan 
Business Academy, said. “We 
want students to demonstrate 
creativity, innovation, collabora­
tion, problem solving, analysis, 
citizenship—all 
these 
things 
that involve much more than sit­
ting down at a computer.”
