EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
I know the best mornings are made of 
pancake batter, warm skin, loose stockings,
how to count tree rings, 
the precise moment to
bite into a persimmon—
how to catch them 
before they splatter onto the ground.
The red in my bottom lip is proof 
I shouldn’t have, but  
I swallowed the pomegranate seed 
anyway. 

When I came home for the holidays,
I didn’t tell my mother a tree started 
growing inside me	
 without her
my roots have sunken 
into things darker than soil
deeper than earth, and
I’ve started to hunger for
things other than harvest.
But in postcards to her
from places like empty apartments 
and the edges of the ocean, 
I write:	
“Doing fine. Miss you.” in the language of 
the dead.
I never pick the prettiest flower anymore,
pluck it right out of the ground.
That is something girls do—
girls who do not know 
how easy it is 
for the ground to break open,
how fathers will stand by
in old college sweatshirts and watch. 
The difference between 
sinking and drowning  
is the acceptance of fate.
Sometimes 
I dip myself in the river 
to forget. 
All the hours are violet here.  
From Persephone

**Title: Watching**
**Author: Ariel Katz**

This is what happened when 
a twenty-three-year-old humpback 
threw herself out of the water:
the guide told us that breaching 
is inexplicable, and that she herself
once tried to lob her body out of its context.
We hooted when our whale
hit her white tail against the sea surface.
It makes me want to cry, a woman said.
A line of red blood ran down a man’s ankle
from an old wound, recently disturbed,
maybe by the ship—it sent us all into each other. 
We stepped on feet, grasped strange shoulders—
there weren’t enough rails to hold.
Girls in identical dresses used their hands to keep
skirts from becoming inverted umbrellas:
they staggered. The guide said in her ponytailed
voice, whale tails are like fingerprints. 
We jostled each other
as the black tire back rolled into and out of our air 
and the intersection tail split the horizon.
Finally, there was the full whale, 
whose largeness was still unseen 
even when the body came before us.
We stretched our cameras and 
tried to keep out the whorls of fingers.
