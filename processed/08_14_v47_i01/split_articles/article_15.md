O
fficer Mike Pepe is cruising around the 
Dwight-Kensington neighborhood when he 
gets the call. Two women, the dispatcher tells him, 
are sitting on a park bench at a nearby elemen­
tary school playground. They’re staring into space 
while a toddler lies screaming on the ground. 
Pepe, a four-year veteran of the New Haven 
Police Department, quickly heads to the scene. 
He finds the two women, perhaps in their thirties, 
their eyes bloodshot, ignoring the baby girl sob­
bing desperately before them.
Pepe climbs out of his cruiser. I follow about 
ten feet behind, wrapping myself tightly in a thick 
knit sweater. It is an unusually frigid afternoon for 
late April, too cold, I think, for a mother to bring 
her child to the park. The baby’s coat looks thin 
and shabby, not thick enough to shield her from 
the wind.
Another officer, Sgt. Mario Francia, arrives on 
the scene. As he and Officer Pepe approach, one 
of the women spots him and finally acknowledges 
the baby. “What happened, mama?” she slurs, not 
moving to scoop the child off the ground. Her 
companion remains too catatonic to react.
Pepe approaches the women, a kind look of 
concern on his face. It is immediately clear to 
him that both are high on something, perhaps 
PCP. “Hey, how are you doin’?” Pepe calls out, 
cautiously approaching the two women. “What’s 
your name?”
Again, neither woman responds. After a long 
pause, the one who had cooed at the baby a mo­
ment earlier utters, “Katina.” The second woman 
still does not speak; she cannot speak.
“What happened to her?” Pepe asks casually, 
gesturing at the child on the ground. “Did she fall 
or somethin’, guys?” 
“She aright,” Katina responds in a daze, the 
baby’s sobs growing louder.
Pepe picks up the baby and starts bounc­
ing her. The baby’s diaper, he later tells me, feels 
as though it is reaching the point of explosion. 
“That’s my baby!” Katina raises her voice. “Why 
you actin’ like this? I’m just chillin’.”
“You seem, uh, very out of it,” he explains 
calmly, asking her to remain seated. “What’d you 
do today?” No response. “You do drugs? You drink? 
Any alcohol or somethin’?”
Pepe is calm and nonjudgmental. He contin­
ues for several more minutes, cajoling and sooth­
ing the women to the best of his ability, until an 
ambulance and a police cruiser arrive to take the 
two women away. Katina does not want to go, yell­
ing that she has done nothing worthy of arrest. 
But she succumbs to her handcuffs and her com­
panion, still impassive, is loaded onto a stretcher 
to be taken to the emergency room. The baby’s 
godmother, who lives nearby, takes the child home. 
“I think we handled that situation the best 
we could,” Pepe tells me back in the cruiser. But, 
several years ago, Pepe adds, he might have ap­
proached the scene differently. He might have ex­
pressed his frustration at the two women; after all, 
they had both willingly taken drugs, endangering 
the baby. Had he acted on these emotions, Pepe 
might have yelled at the women out of frustration, 
perhaps handcuffing Katina more aggressively. He 
could have decided to arrest both women, rather 
than sending one to the hospital. But Pepe now 
understands that when an officer rough-handles 
someone with mental illness, his actions can exac­
erbate the situation.
These days, Pepe responds differently to calls 
like these, thanks to a program in Connecticut 
designed to teach police officers how to recog­
nize and work with individuals who are mentally 
ill. The program, run by a nonprofit organization 
called the Connecticut Alliance to Benefit Law 
Enforcement, or CABLE, has employed the Crisis 
Intervention Team (CIT) model since 2003. The 
core purpose of CIT is to intertwine the realms 
of law enforcement and mental healthcare—
two fields that, until recently, have remained 
resolutely separate. 
Decades ago, such a division made sense: A 
vast majority of Americans with a diagnosable 
mental illness lived out their lives confined inside 
state hospitals or other institutions. In 1955, at 
the peak of “institutionalization,” as the practice 
is now known, these facilities contained 339 beds 
per every 100,000 Americans. But from the late 
fifties through the early eighties, patients were 
discharged from hospitals and returned to their 
communities. The shift was partially intentional: 
Advocates of the plan believed that these individ­
uals would live more fulfilling lives integrated into 
normal society. New psychiatric drugs, which were
