L
ast year, I embarked on a mission at the behest 
of the great American inventor Greg Steiner, 
whose legend preceded him, as legends often do 
in the era of the World Wide Web. I discovered 
him while searching for what remained of the 
workbench tinkerer. Lacking fluency in the arcane 
languages of the high-tech tools that had come to 
govern my life, and armed with a degree in history, 
of all things, I feared being cut off by the 21st cen­
tury’s blade of progress. I wanted some assurance 
that the tinkerer lived on. 
Steiner is, after all, the creator of the famous 
Squeeze Breeze, a hand-held spray bottle with an 
attached fan that allows users to cool off by mist­
ing themselves during, say, a Little League prac­
tice. The Squeeze Breeze is the epitome of what 
he calls “junk inventions,” items that can be made 
in five hours or less. Having sold 80 million units, 
Steiner is king of the junk inventors. And here he 
was, offering his Midas touch to wannabes like 
myself. On Steiner’s website, an Einstein-esque 
caricature named Professor Thinksalot declares 
his noble intentions: “Sincerely Helping the First 
Time Inventor.”
I had read that the wellspring of Yankee inge­
nuity had slowed to a trickle. After Eli Whitney ’92 
(that’s 1792) invented the cotton gin, Yalies all but 
ditched the business of simpler machines. The in­
ventors of yore—Ben Franklin and the like, whose 
Eureka moments became the stuff of American 
folktales—were consolidated in corporate R&D 
departments, which discouraged the more radi­
cal, harebrained, and heroic breakthroughs of de­
centralized innovation. Individuals in the U.S. are 
granted fewer patents today than they were in the 
seventies, both on a per capita basis and as a per­
centage of overall patents issued. 
I wondered what had become of the tinkerers 
who comprised that shrinking sliver, and how, in 
this day and age, they could ride their ideas to the 
top. So I decided to try it myself.
Like any good junk inventor, I had an eye on 
life’s smallest, peskiest, and least-addressed prob­
lems. Loofahs grow moldy, dryers turn socks in­
side out, car seats overheat when you park in 
the sun. Solving these issues is hardly a priority 
for the human race, but if everyone aimed for 
the Nobel Prize, the shoelace would never have 
been invented. 
Aspiring inventors navigate an industry that 
makes big profits from their unrealized dreams

ability to turn inventors’ ideas 
into high-grossing products—
dream factories, I thought. I 
completed the forms provided 
and submitted my idea. Before 
long, my phone was ringing off 
the hook with calls from repre­
sentatives all over the country, 
eager to lend me their wisdom. 
Needless to say, I was flattered. 
When I walked into his of­
fice in Braintree, Massachusetts, 
Carl Cook, a New Product Re­
cruiter for Invents Company, 
LLC, asked me to sign a form 
acknowledging that the odds 
were not in my favor. 
“Ninety-one thousand peo-
ple have sat in your shoes,” 
Cook said, and that was just 
last year. Of those hopeful in­
ventors, a mere 381 made it to 
the next stage, in which the 
company’s 
researchers, 
engi­
neers, and marketers get in­
volved. From that point, just 
eleven inventions made a profit
 for their inventors.
We met in a three-room 
suite across the hall from Ameri­
can Laser Skincare (whose door 
promises 
“Beauty 
Through 
Technology”) in Braintree Ex­
ecutive Park. The reception 
area bookshelf was decorated 
with “As Seen On TV” inven­
tions: the Booty Slide, the Lint 
Lizard, Silly Slippeez, the Sift 
& Toss. Cook’s sole colleague 
at Invents Company’s so-called 
Boston office was Bruce, a 
portly, avuncular man roughly 
one decade Cook’s elder. Both 
employees 
wore 
black-gray 
paisley-patterned ties and had 
ruddy complexions. 
Professor Thinksalot 
of­
fered a list of “the most impor­
tant inventions” to help me on 
my way: Telephone, Light Bulb, 
Microwave, 
Airplane, 
Print­
ing Press, Computer, Skate­
board, Pacemaker, Can Opener. 
I clicked on “Inventors Club,” 
and entered my name and email 
address while membership was 
still free. When the site failed to 
process my request, I called the 
number for the company’s office 
in Downers Grove, Illinois, and 
was greeted by the shrill buzz of 
corporate extinction. 
But in the days that fol­
lowed, the idea came to me. ‘Eu­
reka!’ as they say. 
I encountered many nay­
sayers on my journey from idea 
to product, but rejection only 
hardened my resolve to forge 
ahead. I entered in the Yale En­
trepreneurial Society’s “Elevator 
Pitch Competition” with a shot 
at winning $300, but I never 
even got to present my idea to 
the judges. I also entered in the 
“What’s your thousand dollar 
idea?” competition sponsored 
by a student hacking group 
called Y-Hack, and I finished in 
ninth place, behind seven pro­
posals for software applications 
and one for a t-shirt brand. 
Forsaken by Steiner, Think­
salot, and my classmates, I 
sought a local support group in 
the Inventors’ Association of 
Connecticut, hoping to pick up 
some pearls of wisdom from in­
dustry veterans and meet other 
innovatively inclined Average 
Joes. At the IACT monthly 
meeting, a few dozen people a 
few dozen years older than me 
gathered to discuss their hopes, 
their fears, and—with shifty 
eyes and cautious words—their 
ideas. When their leader, Dr. 
Douglas Lyon, a short, sinewy 
man with a stringy ponytail and 
a Ph.D. in Computer and Sys­
tems Engineering, asked me to 
introduce myself to the group, I 
told them I was an aspiring first-
time inventor in my senior year 
at Yale, majoring in history. 
“Oh, so you invented his­
tory?” quipped an elderly man in 
the group. The room erupted in 
laughter.
“I’m reminded of an old 
joke,” Dr. Lyon chimed in. “You 
can tell a man’s profession by the 
way he responds to a new inven­
tion. The engineer asks, ‘How 
does it work?’ The accountant 
asks, ‘How much does it cost?’ 
The history major asks, ‘You 
want fries with that?’”
Again, the crowd went wild. 
Tail between my legs, I re­
turned to the Internet to seek 
other help. A cursory Google 
search returned a handful of 
companies 
advertising 
their 
“[THESE COM­
PANIES] DON’T 
MAKE THEIR 
MONEY FROM 
THE INVENTION. 
THEY MAKE THEIR 
THE INVENTOR.”
