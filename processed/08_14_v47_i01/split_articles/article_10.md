Jon Roy makes a living from his food truck on Cedar Street
D
uring lunchtime, the stretch of New Haven’s 
Cedar Street between Congress Avenue and 
York Street is filled with the clanking of knives 
and the sizzling of frying fat. Nearly a hundred 
people mill about the two-dozen food carts clus­
tered around the Yale School of Medicine. 
“Where else can you get a full meal for five 
or six dollars?” asks Mary Weng, a student at the 
Yale School of Public Health, as she orders a half-
chicken, half-steak burrito from one of the carts.

Standing in his food truck, Jon’s Lunch, on a 
cold Saturday in March, Jon Roy is working with 
a steady rhythm. Wearing jeans, a black sweater, 
and a Bacardi Limón baseball cap, he serves up 
a “Yagi Soba,” which consists of salad, steak, and 
spaghetti, and a “Stinky Bomb” sandwich with 
gorgonzola, pastrami, onion, and sausage. Roy 
is one of the few truck employees who runs his 
own show, without a boss calling the shots over 
his shoulders. Every weekday, he pulls in at 9:00 
a.m., waiting for the regular medical students, re­
searchers, workers, and administrators who stop 
by between shifts.

When I speak with him in April, he is less than

thrilled that the New England winter has been so 
long this year. He’s tired of this weather, the con­
stant chill. Business is slow when it’s cold outside. 
“There are easier ways of making money,” he says. 
But he has become a familiar face for people who 
form lines at his cart each day.

Customers reach into the till — a simple white 
bucket — to make their own change. “Trusting 
guy, isn’t he?” says an older man with golden glass­
es who stops by for a buffalo chicken wrap.

Roy works alongside trucks serving Chinese, 
Mediterranean, Japanese, Bengali, Indian, Italian, 
Mexican, Korean, Vietnamese, Italian, Ethiopi­
an, and Thai food. But he offers straightforward 
American fare: subs, salads, and wraps. He pre­
pares almost all of the food on site, drawing on 
lessons from childhood summers on an island near 
Maine, where his grandmother and great-aunt — a 
“Julia Child wannabe,” he says — taught him to 
cook. They prepared recipes from cookbooks and 
television cooking shows together.

He ran a food truck with a friend starting 
two decades ago, but when his girlfriend — now 
his wife — got pregnant, he started his own busi­
ness to cover the bills. Getting into the industry 
is not cheap; a used truck can cost around four 
or five thousand dollars, while a new one is usu­
ally around ten thousand. A yearly permit in New 
Haven costs $200.

Now he earns “enough to live comfortably,” he 
says, and he speaks with pride of his 22-year-old 
daughter, who is out of college and working for 
Next Step Energy, a company that designs and in­
stalls renewable energy systems. But when asked 
whether he would want to pass on his business, he 
chuckles: “No. This is my Social Security. I might 
lease it sooner rather than later.”

As we talk, a vendor from a truck on the other 
side of the street comes over to fish some change 
out of Roy’s white bucket, because he’s short a 
few coins.

“You’re a pain in the ass,” Roy says, rolling 
his eyes.

“But I’m a good pain in the ass, right?” replies 
his fellow vendor, grinning. 

“Everybody’s really nice,” Roy assures, after 
the vendor has left. “When I got married, half of 
these vendors were at my wedding.” 

He can never predict whether the business 
day will be good or bad, but the lunchtime crowd 
has sustained him through the years, along with 
the line of trucks on either side of him, making a 
one-man job a more social affair. 

A man in scrubs who is paying for his food 
interrupts our conversation. “This is embarrass­
ing,” the man begins uncomfortably. “But I forgot 
to pay you last time.” For an instant, Roy looks 
taken aback. A second later, he smiles, accepts the 
money for both orders, and tells his regular not to 
worry about it. 

At 2:00 p.m., he begins loading up his materi­
als and cleaning his cart. Then, he hitches it to a 
truck and drives back home.
