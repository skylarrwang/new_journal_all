contribute a homier feel to the 
process. 

When interviews are 
finished and applications are 
read, the committees must pick 
their top choice courses. They 
need to find which ones are most 
engaging, to sift through what's 
fun as a concept and determine 
what works as a class. According 
to Balaban, "a lot of proposals 
come that are frivolous. A subject 
is taken and given a sexy title." 
It's up to the students to see 
through the title and make sure 
the syllabus itself is up to par. 
What one committee finds 
compelling, another might find 
unappealing. That's a good thing 
-
while all the colleges read all 
the applications, each can select 
only two per semester. If they 
all pick the same favorite class, 
they've got to fight for it later 
on. According to Geoff Shaw 
'10, former seminar committee 
coordinator for Branford, "there 
is never an objectively most 
popular class ... One time, there 
was a class on I-banking that 
I thought would be the most 
popular - I thought it would go in 
a flash, but it didn't wind up going 
soon." 

The process finally 
concludes at the long-awaited 
"draft." Coordinators from 
every college meet to battle 
amongst each other in the name 
of academic selection. It can get 
intense. Walker summed up the 
April 2010
whole experience: "It's like the 
United Nations of colleges." 

According to Shaw, Branford's 
seminar committee develops a 
detailed strategy before entering 
the draw. They determine a 
ranking of desirability for their 
choices, and decide how much 
they are willing to compromise 
in the sponsorship of certain 
courses. 

But Branford's biggest 
rival puts them to the test. 
"Saybrook is very passionate 
about the committee," Walker 
reports. "They're very passionate 
about the whole seminar process. 
They have people come to the 
draft in Saybrook gear, facepaints. 
It's really funny and it lightens 
the mood. I kind of wish more 
colleges did it." 

Though one Davenport 
representative described the 
draft as "a passive-aggressive cut-
throat process," Shaw and Walker 
categorized it as "collegial" 
and "friendly competition," 
respectively. Most seminar 
committee members will take 
few, if any, of the courses they've 
personally picked; for them, the 
time and emotion invested in the 
draft comes down to residential 
college loyalty. To each college 
their own, and may the best class 
win.
