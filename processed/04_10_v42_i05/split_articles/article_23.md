In local lobster lore,

1999-will forever be kriown as 
an apocalyptic year. Connecticut 
lobstermen like Rich and Johnny 
started pulling pots full of dead 
lobsters. Scientists thought the 
h<;)t surmer had warmed the 
Sound, weakening the lobsters' 
immune systems and making 
them vulnerable to parasites. 
'!'he lobstermen, for the most 
part, blame a pesticide blitz that, 
combined with sununer storms, 
drained chemicals into the Sound. 
"There was nothing left to 
fish. People lost their licenses. 
It was a war back then." Johnny 
says. Lobster levels still haven't 
snapped back to the way they _ 
were before. 
Rich agrees. ''It stopped being 
April2010 
predictable. You used to know 
. exactly when the lobster. would be 
·. 
coming May 15, then May 20. 
You could tell by the barnacles. 
After 1999, we had to just wait 
and see." 
While they waited, though, 
the fishermen broadened their 
nets. Conch fishing has kept Rich 
in· business, allowing him to hang 
onto his equipment and shop, 
_always hoping for the lobster to 
feturn in greate~ number. "That's 
·what's in my heart ... to me, each 
~h~llfish has a cycle. Right now 
w~'re in a low, and we have been 
for the last seven or eight years. I 
don't know how long it's going to 
take to come back, but I think it's 
. going back up." 
_ On ~e water,· Rich guides 
his boat along lines that run 
North and South on the Sound 
sinking his lobster pots to the 
ocean floor, eight to each buoy, 
fifteen buoys every mile. There is 
no TV, no radio, no boss, and his 
wedge boat is a "big heavy, good 
sea boat from Canada" that he 
bought with a forme£- business 
partner a1tnost ten years ago. 
If the lobster were to 
return in force, Rich thinks the 
business could be lucrative. Rich's 
twelve year-old daughter Kristin 
likes to go out on the boat with 
~ 
and next year, the boat will 
bear her narne. He imagines 
that some day he might pass the 
business on to her.

While Rich is helping :~ "" ·: 
customer, Johnny pulls the largest 
· of the lobsters from the tank. 
He touches a finger to one of 
its claws. This orie, he guesses, is ~ . 
fifty-five years old. 
As Rich finishes with the· , 
customer, Johnny looks toward . ...:_ 
them and rests his hands on the · · 
· edge of the tank. "You know, this 
business isn't luck, it's skill." The 
work is dangerous, his wife, R~se,. 
often reminds him, and business 
has been draining. "I guess having 
your wife and kids say some Hail ~ · 
Mary's every day doesn't hurt 
either." 
p 
The customer walks out 
the open door of the shop, a bag 
of half-century old crustaceans 
swinging from her hand. The 
lobsters inside cling to its plastic 
edges; that was the last sale of 
the day. Before dawn the next 
rnorning, Rich will ready the traps 
and head out on the Sound once 
more.
