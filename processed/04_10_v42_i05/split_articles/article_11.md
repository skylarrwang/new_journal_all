Final 
raft 
The fight to write the blue book 
" 
ay what? SAYBROOI<! Say 
what? SAYBROOI<!" Residential 
·college cheers are regularly heard 
at Intramural sports games, but 
this time, the setting isn't Yale's 
playing fields 
it is a small 
classroom in Scheffield-Sterling-
Srathcona hall. After hours of 
preparation, the time has come 
- not to demonstrate athletic 
superiority, but to pick classes. 
This is the residential college 
seminar draft, the cultnination 
of a long process of evaluation 
negotiation, and strategy. 
Most students know 
the Residential College Seminar 
Program for its nontraditional 
courses; recent offerings have 
included Christian Theology 
and Harry Potter, The Science 
of Brewing, and Hip Hop 
Music and Culture. Instructors· 
aren't Yale professors 
they 
are professionals, hailing from 
fields as diverse as screenwriting, 
children's literature, politics, 
• rnvestment, and nonprofit 
management. The classes 
themselves are unique, but so is 
the student run process that gets 
them here in the first place. 

Established in 1968, the 
sem....,...,lnar program "vas born during 
6 
a period of social revolution 
as a response to what the yale 
College Dean's Office called "a 
· widely felt need for innovation 
and experimentation in the Yale 
College curriculum." In an effort 
to forge bonds between students 
and the administration, the Dean 
invited undergraduates to help 
build the course catalog. Four 
decades later, experimentation 
and innovation are still hallmarks 
of the program. College sen1inars 
are, in fact, required to offer 
something that the regular 
curricuhun doesn't already 
include. 

College seminar proposals 
flood Yale each semester -
between forty and seventy five 
individuals, on 
average, apply 
to teach. In 
each college, a 
srnall group of 
students gather 
with a faculty 
advisor to 
form a seminar 
comm1ttee. 
They' e got 
work ahead 
of them-
conu.,..ruttee 
read and discuss all proposals, 
then interview applicants before 
they decide which classes to 
select. 

Each college meets 
candidates in a slightly different 
way. According to Ian Walker 
'1 0, head of the Si1lirnan Seminar 
committee, "a few colleges will 
try to have a block of interviews 
in one day. We kind of have 
a different philosophy ... we 
wine and dine our interviewees. 
What we usually do is take them 
to dinner in Silliman dining 
hall, we spread it over a week 
or two." Davenport takes its 
own approach: interviews are 
conducted in faculty advisor 
Eytan Halaban's apartment to
