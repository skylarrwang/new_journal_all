The Last Lobsterman 
Is it the end of the line 
for Rich Gambarella's lobster business? 
~SarahMich 
R
ch Gambardella sets 
up shop at the corner of Chapel 
and Mill Streets, half a block 
past a drawbridge that separates 
a small Fair Haven inlet from 
the larger Long Island Sound. 
Stacked lobster traps sit at the 
end of the driveway near a small 
dock. Across the inlet is a giant 
pile of mulch, covered by a black 
tarp and held down by tires. At 
least twice a week for the past 
twenty years, Rich has watched 
th~ sun rise over this shiny 
plastic volcano as he heads out 
into the Sound-setting gear and 
pulling pots before returning to 
his New Haven Lobster Shop 
by two in the afternoon. He is 
the last lone lobsterman of New 
Haven. 

"We're very simple, very 
small. We don't draw attention 
to ourselves-not really used 
to press," he says as he walks 
me into his shop. "D on't mind 
the mess." Rich picks up empty 
plastic bags and moves them 
from the top of the freezer to 
the cabinet. There is a small 
makeshift kitchen to the right, 
where he sometimes cooks crab 
with Cajun seasoning, and a 
desk to the left, where he keeps 
an eight-cup coffee pot that 
he finishes off daily. Lobsters 
and rock crabs scuttle about a 
green basin in the back half of 
the store, separated by species 
and size with white lattice. The 
one-room storehouse is damp 
but clean, and smells more like a 
fresh tide pool than a fish tank. 

The way Rich tells the 
story, the sea was always in 
his blood. "My first memories 
are of fishing for big blackfish 
right here in New Haven," he 
says. Nevertheless, he stumbled 
into the lobster business 
unexpectedly. His uncle had 
been a lobsterman for thirty 
years when his brother-Rich's 
father--decided to join him in 
1990. Just few years later, Rich's 
father got hurt, so Rich stepped 
in. "My dad said I could fill in 
for him for two days. I've done it 
ever since." 

Rich has the outline of a 
lobster on his right forearm, a 
tattoo he got four years ago but 
has never had inked in. He hopes 
someday to add his lobstermads 
license number and his buoy color 
· to the body of the crustacean. 

Lobsters are very important to 
Rich, and he knows a lot about 
them. 

"They say a lobster can live a 
hundred years," Rich told me one 
Sunday afternoon in early April. 
"They· say they grow as much as 
75 pounds, and they daim they 
can live to be 1 00 years old." 

Since he began lobster fishing 
and selling in Fair Haven in 1999, 
Rich says the neighborhood 
demographic has trapsitioned 
fro~ Italian, to Black, to Puerto 
Rican. "Now it's all Latinos-
Guatemalans, Ecuadorians, 
Mexicans. All big fish eaters. 
Since Christmas, business has 
been great. It's been easy. They 
keep coming back." As he speaks, 
two women in a white car drive 
onto the gravel. ''Ah-see, here's a 
customer 
here comes one now. 
She was here yesterday. I close 
at 4 pm and it's 4:30. They're 
lucky. . . usually by halfway 
through Sunday I'm out of crabs." 

Inside, one of the women 
moves around the basin, past the 
signs that Rich has labeled conchs, 
corucha, scungilli. "iQue grande es!" 
She points to" a crab. 

''Ah yeah, you see a big one?" 
Rich says.

"Two for me and two for 
her. And that one," the woman 
requests. 

Rich picks up a large rubber 
rake and scrapes the crabs 
towards the sun. 
"Gee ... you're 
making me reach all the way 
over there? You oughta get it." 

By this time of day, he explains, 
the best crabs are mostly picked 
through. Tomorrow morning, the 
stragglers will be sold wholesale, 
to be replaced by a fresh batch on 
Thursday. 

There is, arguably, one 
other lobsterman in New Haven, 
a fifty-year old man named 
Johnny. He and his wife Rose 
stop by at five o'clock to pay their 
thanks for the rock crabs Rich 
gave thetn last night. ''Those were 
delicious, Richy. Salty. Definitely 
salty. I was spiu ing up salt this 
morning." 

Johnny and Rich have 
known each other since they were 
kids and they share the waters 
of the New Haven Sound. Rich 
sets his traps at depths between 
40 and 98 feet, and Johnny takes 
the shallower water. Rich's boat is 
bigger, though, and his business 
is full-titne. ''Johnny's boat could 
probably fit on the back of mine," 
Rich tells me later, "which is why 
they might call me the last true 
lobsterman. But don't tell that to 
Johnny." 

There is no doubt they're 
different men. Johnny has many 
more tattoos; a Technicolor 
mermaid swirls around his right 
shoulder. He speaks more loudly 
and more often than his friend. 
Johnny's gestures reach closer 
to your face; Rich's are more 
conservative. When the two of 
them talk, they reminisce about 
the lore of the Sound. "In the last 
five or six years all the old-tirners 
have retired and gotten out of 
it. There used to be five in New 
Haven, and seven fishing in our 
part of the Sound," Rich says. 
"But even then, Richy, 
we're probably the only two guys 
who got along," Johnny adds. 
''Richy could call me and say 'I 
need ya,' and I'd be there. The old 
guys were worried about what the 
other guys were doing. It was boat 
for boat." 

Johnny wi11 be fifty-one 
next week. He mentions this, 
and Rich turns and puts his hand
