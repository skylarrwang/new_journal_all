The union of faith and romance 
by Kate S elker 
___..eah Libresco '12 hoped that 
her boyfriend, Chris Pagiriella '12, 
could find her a very particular 
Valentine's Day Card. 
"I told him he didn't have to 
get me one unless he could find 
• 
one that said, 'I love you so much that 
I am accidental!J condemningyou to hell 
f?y wishingyou existed. m She tells me. 
Chris looked. "But it wasn't in 
the Yale Book store! Not the first 
or second floor," he laments. 

The romantic sentiment, which 
didn't quite make it to Hallrnark, 
began with a wild hypothetical: 
Would Chri~ a practicing Catholic, 
rather have Leah, an ardent atheist, 
exist with her heart hardened complete!J 
against Christ forever- or would he 
rather she did not exist at all? 
Chris thought for a moment. 
''Well I'd probably wish you 
existed, but that would be for 
selfish reasons." He's in love. 
Come Hell or high water, he 
wants her by his side. 

Conunons is a cavernous, 
cro\.vded space, but when I meet 
· Leah and Chris in the back, they 
only see each other. Throughout 
16 
our conversation, Leah will 
squeeze Chris' cheek or he'll pat 
down her hair. When one puts 
. 
an elbow on the table, the other 
soon follows, and when one leans 
back, it's only a matter of tirne 
before the other is tipping in his 
or her chair. (I've read about this 
"chameleon effect" in psychology 
class - when a couple is close, 
they unconsciously mirnic each 
others' reactions.) 
Chris and Leah have agreed, 
along with three other couples, to 
be interviewed about religion and 
relationships at Yale. It's the type 
of stuff you're never supposed 
to bring up at a cocktail party. 
We're told to avoid politics, avoid 
God, avoid talking about your 
great boyfriend or your horrible 
ex. But there's so much to learn 
if we do. Chris and Leah, Sloane 
and Harris, Jessica and Roland, 
and Michelle and Alan have let 
me into their private lives. So they 
talk, and I listen. 

SEX 
for Sloane Heller '12, is about 
doing a good deed. I meet her and 
her boyfriend Harris Eppsteiener 
'12 in the Slifka Center, which 
serves as a hub of Jewish life 
at Yale. She is small and brown 
haired, with a cheery, high 
cheeked smile; he has a politician's 
gaze and blue eyes. They speak 
to me frofi! the same bench, 
opting to squeeze in next to each 
other instead of spreading out in 
separate chairs. He leans on her 
shoulder.

Can you have sex on Shabbat? 
I ask the pair. Shabbat is the tirne 
between Friday night and Saturday 
evening, considered holy in the 
Jewish tradition. 
Sloane nods furiously. 
''DOUBLE MITZVAH!" Mitzvot 
' 
are acts of hun1an kindness. By 
THE NEW JOURNAL

Jewish law, you're required to do 
them. 
Harris corrects her. "No no 
no, that's basically only if you're 
married.'' 
Then again, they admit, college 
kids sometimes ignore that part. 
And besides, Sloane and Harris 
argue, J udiasm is very pro sex. 
''Within the context of the family, 
it's absolutely encouraged," Sloane 
explains. "There are passages in 
the Talmud, which is the main 
-
text of Jewish law, about how to 
please your wife." 
"I've never read them." Harris 
adrnits. 
Sloane turns to look at her 
boyfriend. "I have. " 
. ·-
fn truth, they explain, it's more 
about procreation than pleasure . 
By Jewish law, men are required to 
have sex with their wives. (There 
are some logistical dispensations. 
"If you're a sailor, you can do it 
£ 
"H 
) 
ewer t1 rnes, 
arns notes. 
"Jewish babies! Yay!" Sloane 
exclairns. 
But she's serious. "Since the 
Holocaust, there's a very prevalent 
fear in our grandparents' 
generation that we could be 
wiped out. And that's a very 
visceral thing, because all of 
my grandparents' friends were 
survivors.'' She looks at Harris . 
"Barbara" she says. 
''Barbara?" he asks. 
April2010 
"Babs," she clarifies. 
"Oh, Babs." He gets it now. 
Babs is Sloane's grandmother; . 
the majority of her friends are 
Holocaust surVivors. With so 
many people murdered under 
Hider's rule, it makes sense that 
Babs' generation feels strongly 
about making sure the religion 
doesn't die out. And since Judiasm 
doesn't proselytize, the only way 
to perpetuate the religion is by 
raising Jewish children. 
"It's the first commandment in 
the 613 commandments!" Harris 
says. "Be fruitful and multiply." 

For a Protestant opinion, I talk 
with Jessica Letchford '11. She's 
dating a fellow Christian, Roland 
Reimers '11, long distance while 
he spends a semester abroad in 
Beijing. Jessica talks to me about 
their relationship from a bench 
in the Davenport courtyard, her 
blonde hair glows in the sunlight. 
Roland emails me about Jessica 
from China. "Our fundamental 
trust in God is what binds us 
closely together," he-writes. 
"Since we have assurance in God's 
plan for us no matter what, we 
can just enjoy our relationship 
exactly the way it is." 
Jessica, too, says sex has 
it's place in religion -- when 
it is between a pair united in 
matnmony. 
"I think that God created sex 
to be a really good thing, but that 
it brings the greatest happiness 
and the greatest fulfillment in 
the context that He created it 
for." That· context is marriage. 
According to the Bible, Jessica 
tells me, God intended the 
relationship between a man and 
a woman to mirror the bond 
between Christ and the church. 
As such, it shall be sacred. 

RITUALS 
are common across religions. 
Leah, the atheist, was skeptical 
of the ones performed at Chris' 
Catholic Mass. "At first, to be 
honest, it looked like when you 
watch a fantasy movie," she tells 
me. "There are these bizarre and 
arcane rituals!" 
"I love your National 
Geographic take on this," Chris 
responds. 
She softens somewhat. 
"Mass doesn't seem to touch 
on Catholicism that much, but 
rather just on being decent 
people. I was su t prised," she 
acqmesces. 
Chris smiles goofily at his 
girlfriend. Leah turns to look at 
n1.e. She's read his mind. 
"He thinks you can't ha e 
objective morality without God," 
she says, and Chris nods . 
At least they're on the same 
page about how they disagree.

Sloane and Harris, for their 
part, keep Shomer Shabbat. The 
practice means different things to 
different people, but it's mainly 
about observing the Sabbath's 
prohibition on work. From Friday 
at sundown until Saturday night, 
Harris doesn't use money, cook, 
write, use his computer, or drive 
a car. 
"l.don't use lights." Sloane 
explains. She and Harris don't 
use their cell phones on Shab bat, 
either. (fhis can make it hard to 
meet up with friends on a Friday 
night.) But Sloane breaks one 
particular rule. 
"I do take showers." She looks 
at Harris. "That shower's for 
you. That's a gift" she tells hirn, 
then looks over to me. ''You're 
not supposed to shower because 
you're hot supposed to heat 
water'' she explains. 
Harris smiles. 

Jessica says she misses Roland. 
But they, too, share a ritual that 
keeps them close to each other, 
by' keeping them close to God. 
S 
EIS 
THEIR VIRTU-
e 
PEL 
Christian relationships, according 
to Jessica, are like a triangle. God's 
at the top, and each partner forms 
a bottom corner.

'~nd if you each grow 
closer to God, you grow closer 
together!" she explains. 
So they pray together, even 
though they're far apart. Skype is 
their virtual chapeL 
''We both close our eyes, and 
. . 
usually one will pray first, and 
· the other one will pray next. We 
pray out loud together. We'll · 
pray for each other and for each 
other's friends, and pray for our 
relationship," Jessica tells me. 
Roland writes to me that 
praying. over Skype "reaffirms and 
cements the fact that we, first and 
foremost, want to look to God 
for ever 
· g in our life, before 
we look to each other. Fears and 
co'ncerns that we have - whether 
about school work and classes, 
looking for jobs and grad schools, 
or o~her post-graduation plans 
- don't seem nearly as daunting 
when we can pray about them 
openly and honestly with each 
other." 
For them, the ritual of prayer 
brings comfort. It works.

works, too. I learn this from 
Alan Wesson '11 and Michelle 
Ho '11; Alan's been a life-long 
Christian, but Michelle just 
recently joined the faith. One of 
their first shared experiences was 
at Alan's church. He'd invited 
Michelle and two other friends, 
and none of the three were 
religious. 
"One of them was like, 'Yeah, 
I don't think I'm going to find 
God in a church.' The other one 
found it hard to believe, too, 
because science makes sense to 
him," Alan remembers. 
But Michelle was different. 
She left the church changed. At 
that time, Michelle was absorbed 
in thoughts of her fatnily back 
home, and how she missed them. 
The pastor spoke about love and 
cotnrnunity. He spoke more about 
people than about God. 
"I just sat there, and I 
remember clearly he referenced 1 
Corinthians 13, the passage about 
what love is." It felt right to her. 
The choir started playing ''Your 
Love Never Fails," and Michelle 
was tnoved to tears. 
"It was just like, oh, this 
is speaking right to me," she 
remembers. "That's what I needed 
to hear." Over the sutnrner, 
Michelle stayed at Yale, and 
the Christian community here 
welcomed her. 
"Just through potlucks, and 
talking," she found her place 
in the Church. "My needs were 
being filled all over the place," she 
explains. 
The process was moving for 
Alan, too. His world changed.
