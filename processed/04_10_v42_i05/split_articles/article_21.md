pushes me to the side as a forklift 
whizzes by,. nearly taking off my 
arm. 
. "This place .is chaotic like that. 
. 
You've got to watch yourself," 
he says handing me a pair of 
safety goggles that all employees 
and visitors are required to wear 
on the work floor. The complex 
is vast and mazelike, with long 
poorly lit hallways opening up to 
work stations. From the way he 
navigates it seems that Dwight 
could find his way around the 
factory in his sleep - and perhaps 
he has. He has spent the past 
six years working the graveyard 
shift six to seven nights a week. 
At first he tried to a:void working 
w~kend nights, but Sikorsky pays 
$1;000 for one night of overtime 
• • 
-an offer Dwight finds hard to 
refuse. 


Despite the amount of 
titne he has spent looking at 
helicopters, Dwight has never 
flown in one. On Sikorsky's 
annual fatni1y day, members of 
the Sikorsky ad rni nistration drive 
a number of helicopter models 
out onto the flight field ~here 
they allow employees and their 
fami1ies to sit in the luxurious 
leather seats and finger the 
controls, but the vehicles remain 
securely on the ground. 
''I wouldn't argue if they tried 
to give me one of those," Dwight 
says, palling one of the corporate 
helicopters, complete with wood-
paneled bars, which sell·for up to 
$15 million. 
"I would just park it in 
my front yard for the neighbors 
to gawk at. No _way I could pay 
for gas, but can you imagine?" 


Before we call it a · 
day, Dwight wants to show 
me som~thing special: a fleet 
of helicopters that Sikorsky 
is building for Obama. We 
wind through hangers housing 
completed helicopters and . 
storerooms with disembodied 
helicopter parts. We dodge 
forklift after forklift and weave in 
and out of a tour group of yoqpg 
children and teenagers dressed 
in camouflage. "Stratford Eagles: 
Stratford's Civil Air Force" I 
make out on their patches. 
"Did you know that the 
President actually flies with three 
helicopters so that potential 
terrorists don't know which one 
he's in?" Dwight asks as we walk. 
"It's an awful waste of fuel, but 
he is Obama." 


Finally we arrive at our 
destination: a door with a small 
wire-crossed window cut in it. 
We peek through the 
wired glass to catch a glimpse of 
the aitcraft, but a frowning guard 
taps at us from the other side and 
shakes his finger "no." 
"Aw, shucks," Dwight 
says, sighing. "Security on those 
birds is ti-ight." 


Defeated, he leads me 
to the cafeteria so he can get a 
· ·snack. I feel relieved. It is 3 p.m. 
and I have yet to see hitn eat or 
drink anything since I met him at 
9:30 a.m. I had started to wonder 
whether Dwight was a machine 
himself. 


The hot food area is closed, 
so he opts for something from 
one of the five vending machines 
in the lounge. He punches in 
D7 and watches intently as the 
mechanical springs move to 
eject a plastic wrapped blueberry . 
muffin from its roost. He waits 
a split second to claim his treat, 
trying to figure out the mechanics 
of the machine. 


Back at Yale, Dwight and I sit 
on a bench outside of William L . 
Harkness Hall, and we talk about 
his overall experience as a Yalie. 
Because he's so busy, Dwight 
has had little titne to get to know 
other undergraduates. In fact, 
in his five years at Yale, he tells 
me I am just the third person to 
inquire about his background. 
''Whether people ask me 
about my story or not is not the 
issue," Dwight explains. "Even 
though the Eli Whitney Students 
Program has been in existence 
for over 20 years, a lot of people 
don't know about it. It was alrnost 
as if Yale was hiding it." 


I had to put posefully dig 
to find infonnation on the 
Eli Whitney program and its 
students. The web site, a small 
subset of yale.edu, is oddly 
sparse. The promotional video 
in which Dwight appears, a short 
description, and a Frequently 
Asked Question s section are the 
only components. There is no list 
· of current or past E li Whitney 
students, or reports on their 
acco~plishments before enrolling 
at Yale. 


Presumably, this is to protect 
the privacy of the Eli Whitney 
students who 
like their 
Yale take classes. Yale doesn't 
publicize personal information 
or profiles about its other 
undergraduates, so why should 
the Eli Whitney students be 
treated differently? 


Most Yale undergrads speak of 
their classmates as the centerpiece 
of their Yale experience; they 
often claim geu ing to know 
other students is more important 
than classes themselves. It seems 
strange, then, that the Eli Whitney 
progra 111 accepts individuals with 
such unique life experiences, ·but 
does not provide a fra rnework in 
·which they can easily share them. 


If the program were m ore visible, 
other Yale undergraduates would 
be less fearful of intruding and 
more likely to engage their Eli 
Whitney classmates outside of 
lecture and section. 


The promotional video on 
the website, fihned and posted 
in 2008, represents Yale's recent 
.realization for a need. to publicize 
the Eli Whitrtey students 
program. 


''When I first saw that video," 
Dwight says pausing, "I cried. 
I used to walk around -campus 
looking at the buildings and think 
'how did I make it here? Am I 
even alive?'" 


Considering his 
circumstances, Dwight has done 
very well at Yale - earning 7 As 
and A-s in his 17 classes. 
"John Hope Franklin 
graduated Harvard with a 3.7," 
Dwight cormnen,ts, referring to 
the renowned black scholar whose 
biography he'd read in Norms and 
Deviance. "But during that tirne 
he didn't work, or have a wife, or 
kids. To me graduating Yale with a 
3.3 would be like graduating with 
a 4.0." 


Dwight credits his graduation 
frorn Yale to years of hard work, . 
sacrifice and the support of his 
fan1ily. Graduating from college 
has been his goal for over 30 
years, though he never dreamed it 
would be from Yale. 


"My father once told me that I 
would never amount to anything. 
Finally, I can stop trying to prove 
him wrong." 


A Yale Spanish professor 
once asked Dwight if there was 
anything she could do to help 
make her class easier for him. 
Dwight was struggling with 
conjugations and pronunciation, 
and couldn't seem to remember 
vocabulary. 


"I thanked her for her offer, 
but told her that I wasn't looking 
for any sp~cial treatment. I'm just 
a Yale student just like -any other. 
Except maybe a little older." 


Dwight has never taken 
handouts and doesn't plan on 
starting now. When the dean of 
Ezra Stiles College hands hitn his 
Yale diploma in May, it will be 
because he's earned it .
