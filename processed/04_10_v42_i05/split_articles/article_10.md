Hitting a High 
ote 
How one New Haven organization uses music to build community 
Tina Lee Hadari skips to the 
corner of the classroom with 
startling spunk for a woman in 
her third trimester. A young girl 
sitting in the middle of the room · 
pulls a bow across the strings of a 
cello that is almost her size. ''Am 
I warmer?" Hadari asks, crinkling 
her face into a s:mile as she peeks 
behind a piano for the teddy bear 
her student has hidden. 
Hadari is the founder of 
Musk .Haven, an not-for-profit 
organization for budding string 
players who live or go to school 
in the Hill, Dwight, Dixwell and 
N ewhallville neighborhoods, 
four of New Haven's poorest 
areas. Few of Music Haven's 
students have had experience 
with instrumental music before 
entering the program; few could 
afford less.ons or instruments. 
Music Haven itself is a young 
performer. In the fall of 2007, 
Hadari handed twelve youngsters 
wooden dowel rods with erasers 
on the end to practice holding . 
a bow. The newly-minted 
tnusicians, generally around seven 
years old, proved responsibility by 
bringing the dowels to class each 
day and not breaking them. After 
a year, they were handed a more 
precious gift 
a free musical 
• mstrurnent. 

For the musicians of 
Music Haven, community is 
paramount. At Music Haven,

says Hadari, "this is a farrlily; 
we take can~ of each other." ·

hard to integrate themselves into 
the city fabric. Four days a week, 
each musician offers after-school 
lessons to twelve students at 
the Wexler Grant and John C. 
Daniels schools. By night, the 
group meets as the Haven String 
Quartet. 

As members of the 
professional quartet, the four 
musicians bring world-class 
instrumental performances to 
the Elm City for free. Most 
chamber groups are based in an 
academy or conservatory, but 
the Haven String Quartet has an 
"urban residency;" the entire city 
is home turf. Though they play 
some ticketed performances ~n 
churches and other traditional 
venues, they play most concer_ts 
in libraries, senior residences, 
private homes and schools. Their 
aim is to make music "accessible 
' 
to everybody within the 
community: financially, culturally, 
and location-wise" says Sarah 
Perkins, Program Coordinator. 
Any donations from the concerts 
go towards the lessons program 
and the instruments given to 
students. 

As a professional group, 
the quartet members confront 
matters of teamwork, 
accountability, and musicianship 
- the same ideals that they 
emphasize with their pupils. 
Says Hadari, "we're still trying 
to develop all the skills we 
want to impart to the kids, like 
communication, how we take care 
of each other. That's the bigger 
goal of Music Haven: Through 
music, we're trying to teach 
them how to be part of a bigger 
THE NEW JOURNAL 


In 2007, after a year spent 
assembling a board of directors, 
applying for grants, an~ raising 
money, Hadari received the go-
ahead to establish Music Haven 
in New Haven public schools. 
She called in analysts from the 
Yale School of Management to 
conduct a needs assessment to 
decide where to set up residence. 
The program began with 
twelve students. It doubled to 
twenty-four students in 2009 ' 
and trains thirty-six this year. Its 
waiting list projects over sixty 
students for next year, at which 
point Music Haven may be 
forced to cap the program. All 
students receive free instrurnents 
from Music Haven, which obtains 
them at wholesale discount 
with :help from localluthier Ute 
Brinkmann. 

Music Haven even has a 
composer-in-residence 
Hadari's 
husband, acclaitned violinist 
Netta Hadari. Mr. Hadari 
composes music to accompany 
children's books like The Lorax 
and Giraffes Can't Dance, which 
the Quartet then performs while 
Mr. Hadari reads the stories. He 
is currently working on a piece 
called "Everyone Knows What 
a Dragon Looks I .ike." The 
end result will give each quartet 
member a one-tninute solo ' 
played collaboratively with the 
New Haven Charnber Orchestra 
and the Music Haven kids 
themselves. · 
April2010 
The Music Haven program 
is modeled after Conununity 
MusicWorks in Providence ' 
Rhode Island, a non-prc>fit 
organization that aims to unite a 
lessons program and quartet into 
a symbiotic entity. Hadari hopes 
that her quartet will "become 
more of a 
feature of the 
neighborhood" 
and "bring 
together a 
diverse audience" 
through local, 
long-standing 
relationships 
within the 
commuruty. 
The community 
members must 
be convinced that Music Haven 
will not go the way of the many 
other well-intentioned but short-
lived endeavors that originate 
from Yale. Money is an ongoing 
concern for an organization 
funded largely by donations and 
grants. 

But the program is being 
noticed. Music Haven recently 
received an Arts Award from the 
Arts Council of Greater New 
Haven in 2008 as a "Ground 
Breaker," an accolade given to 
"individuals or organizations 
whose fresh, raw ideas spur 
mnovatlve programs." And 
David Brensilver, Director of 
Communications at the Arts 
council, lauds the program as 
something that "no one else is 
doing;" in bringing instrutnental 
lessons to students who wouldn't 
have had it before. 

Hadari does not think of 
Music Haven as catering to a 
particular group or 'serving' 
- disadvantaged residents, though; 
. instead, the organization 
should encourage community 
members of different social ' 
ethnic, and cultural groups to 
mix. She envisions Music Haven 
expanding beyond the lessons 
progratn to become a "fun place 
for kids to hang out and play 
chamber music and talk about 
issues in their lives, almost like 
a youth group at church, but 
revolving around music." 
The program is still finding 
its footing, but Hadari is 
conmutted to helping it adapt 
and grow. As Hadari says, smiling 
optirnistically and pau ing her own 
maternal bulge, ''progress comes 
in baby steps."
