Reading between the lines at New Haven's Public Library 
At Yale, we do not 
simply house books, we worship 
them. Sterling Memorial Library, 
according to its architect James 
Gable Rogers, is a "Cathedral of 
Learning" and Beinecke bears 
resemblance to a marble-walled 
shrine. Our library system is the 
fourth .largest in the country, 
holding upward of 12 million 
volutnes. Right off of the Green, 
closer to 0 ld Campus than 
Sterling itself, is the New Haven 
Public Library. Though it is often 
overlooked by University students, 
this city library has its own 
devotees. 

The Public Library may 
have fewer books than Yale's · 
library system, but each is more 
carefully selected for popular 
interest. Besides, while New 
Haven residents can visit Yale's . 
libraries during the day, they can't 
take out books for free, like they 
can at the Public Library. 

Most interactions between 
Yale and the New Haven Public 
Library aren't for checking out 
books. It's sometitnes a site

. for public readings of student 
writing, and it's where a number 
of Yalies do community service, 
helping visitors with tax forms or 
technology. Some Yale students 
use the library's local history 
room, which is home to old maps, 
city directories, and newspapers, 
for research.

Kathy DeNigris, the Chief of 
Public Services, guesses a mere 
150 current Y alies hold library 
cards. "They're probably checking 
out bestsellers 
and films are 
huge," she said. Maria Tonelli, 
the library's Head of Circulation/ 
Access Services, estimates that 
only one Yale student visits the 
library each day. 

I arrive for a visit at 9:39 
on the Saturday before Easter . 
The library is supposed to open at 
10:00, but I've heard a line usually 
forms before opening time, so 
I arrive early. When I get to the 
library, there's no line. Actually, 
there's not a single person on the 
library steps. A few people walk 
by on the street, but no one stops. 
The website had told me the 
library was closed yesterday for 
Good Friday, but it said nothing 
of Saturday. A sign on the door 
indicates otherwise. "GOOD 
FRIDAY," says the printed sign: 
''We Will Close For This Holiday." 
But someone has reconsidered 
and left a mark in Sharpie. ''Both 
GOOD FRIDAY + Saturday, 
April 3." 

As it turns out, many of 
the library's visitors hadn't gotten 
the message, either. A man 
saunters up to the doors a couple 
minutes aftet; I've arrived. He's
