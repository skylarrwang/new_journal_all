·dad is John and David!" I told 
people for weeks), but things 
went smoothly enough for my 
mom to 1ssue a second invite. 
Gradually, Plan A was discarded. 
Three . years and nine months 
after his initial contribution ' 
John Leonard became my father. 
Throughout 
my 
school 
years, neither of my parents 
had a partner, and the not-
so-keen observers at parent 
potlucks were quick to read 
them 
as 
affable 
divorcees. 
Sexuality aside, I can't think of 
an unlikelier union. At a titne 
when my mother was routinely 
mistaken for my grandmother, 
my father could bring a bottle 
of wine to the checkout stand 
and still, from titne to tirne, get 
carded. Annette Lund makes

But 
perhaps 
most 
importantly, my mother is not 
that gay. She never came out to 
her parents; she didn't send tne 
to any two-mommy playgroups. 
With time, she came to identify 
more with heterosexual parents 
than 
the 
childless 
lesbians 
she had known. Given the

out as unfeminine. But until 
I asked him not to, my dad

Every Friday during middle · 
school, I'd drop my coat at 
Martini's feet, _kick off shoes 
and socks, and .sit cross-legged 
on the couch, waiting for the 
central ritual of my weekly 
visits to begin. My father would 
bring a blanket, and facing each 
other on opposite ends of the 
couch, I'd read aloud 
to a 
man who averaged a book a 
year 
a single chapter of Harry 
Potter. Our ritual was best on 
rainy days. My father · wocld 
warm my pruny feet under the 
blanket while I sucked on cough 
drops to recover from the latest 
round of nasal British accents I 
affected to win his laughter, like 
applause. We made it through 
the first four vohunes this way, 
ninety-four 
chapters, 
1,824 
pages overall.

Dad's Day, as we came 
-· 
to call it, was an exercise in 
distilled parenting. Infused with 
the deliberateness of a fatniiy 
relationship 
pursued 
once 
weekly, Fridays with my father 
never failed to be quality tirne. 
This meant rituals. Before Harry 
Potter, we took turns reading 
from 
D'Aulaire's 
~Book of 
Greek Myths and covering the 
walls of my room with drawings 
of the goddesses. Before that ' 
the heart of Dad's Day lay in the 
weaving of five blindingly tiny 
rows on tny authentic Native 
American 
miniature 
beading 
loom, snacking while we let 
our eyes rest, then squinting 
our way across five tnore rows. 
For years, I recycled any joke 
that earned its place within our 
father-daughter pantheon: the 
"easy-to-assemble lamp" that 
never got completed, the trendy 
uncomfortable furniture, 
fact it t?ok hitn three Junes to 
read Three Junes. 


And so, surrounded by gay 
paraphernalia, I occupied my 
father's space with a stubborn 
adherence to the ·· culture of

childhood. Our best joke and 
best 
ritual 
happened 
every 
Friday night. ''Tuck me in!" I'd 
yell, and my father would leap 
up from wherever he was and 
-run to my bedside, his hands 
stuffing the blankets under the 
ntattress in a manic display of 
thoroughness. I'd kiss hirn on · 
the cheek and he would say 
goodnight. But in the sliver 
of the door shutting behind 
hirn I could always see a slice 
of the Martini lady, cleavage 
spouting above her bandeau ' 
and I'd feel my stornach tighten. 
Surrounded 
by 
signs 
but 
cushioned by assntned illiteracy, 
I feared a tirne when I might be 
called upon to understand the 
language. 
The older I grew, the rnore


the apartment 
closed to the 
outside world 
became the one 
place I could interact with my 
father on my own kiddish terms. 
His friends were kind to me, but 
they were just too edgy. One 
April, my father organized an 
egg hunt at one of his friend's 
houses and I came home sulky, 
complaining that the last time I 
checked, the real Easter Bunny 
didn't drink beer or smoke 
cigarette. At gatherings, ·he was 
constantly depositing me with 
some snarky dyke comedienne, 
only to find me alone in the 
garden 
ten 
minutes 
later, 
observing somebody's terrier. 
I knew I should try harder. 
But I didn't want to talk to 
these people on the plane of 
equivalence adolescence would 
provide. And I especially didn't 
want to be a teenager around my 
father, who was too young, too 
current, claiming the cultural 
and sexual territory I wanted for 
my own. 
When my father's thirties 
came to a close, he threw a huge 
FUCI< FORTY costume party 
in a rented space near Broadway. 
I showed up early with my 
mother to make an appearance 
b_efore the party really started, 
wearing a bra for the first time. 
Only a handful of _ people 
had arrived, and I circUlated 
from guest to guest, doing my 
best to make cute, exuberant 
conversation. At one point, 
my father sidled up to me and, 
indicating a man on the opposite 
side of the room, cracked a joke 
about his outfit: red body paint 
and a black leather thong. It was 
a real gay man joke told just for 
me 
campy, blunt, the kind I'd 
hear hitn make to his friends 

when discussing something like 
Monica Lewinsky's make-up. 
I feigned confusion. What 
defense did I have except to act 
younger, remain a child who 
could still, in innocence, walk 
eyes open through . a parent's 
sexual world? But I felt a stab 
of shame at my . own evasion. 
Now that I was thirteen, I was 
. 
spending more and more time 
swatting aside my father's offers 
of parity. I wasn't _ ready . for us 
to be equals. All I wanted was to 
return to the apartment~ where 
I could close my doors to GQ, 
and from within the walls of a 
bedroom decked out in my own 
pastel renderings of Aphrodite, 
wait for my father~s hands to 
tuck me in . .

forward into high school. The 
half-done lamp continued to 
serve as a mockable floor piece, 
but I was starting to worry. We 
needed new vocabulary, and

with accusation. Gayness was

wasn't asking more about my

feared the sex content of 
his answers. Who· ·else's father

called "The Greatest Hole on 
Earth?" There were whole parts 
of his history I only knew about 
in pieces: the former boyfriends, 
the plague years of the eighties, 
the fully sketched story of his 
corrung-out. 
All those high school years 
in the apartment, I was haunted 
by who I might have been if I'd 
been raised entirely by my father. 
In . a blue state, his brand of 
gayness was not a liability but an 
asset: what could be. cooler than 
having a dad who was ex-besties 
with . a nationally syhdicated sex 
columnist? But I had fallen-short 
of claiming my inheritance. Side-
by-side, we looked like a fixer 
duo o;ut of Queer Eye. I felt 
stung whenever he suggested I

denied 
having 
crushes and never shared my 
tentatively emerging music taste, 
even as I eyed his cabinets full 
of alb{uns. I was so intimidated 
by his 
style-commentary that 
on Fridays, I dressed myself in 
T-shlrts. Flipping through his 
DVD collection, my father would 
always joke that we should settle 
for my favorite, Finding Nemo. 
"Don't you want to update 
your room?" my father often 
asked when he stopped in to find 
me, his curiously studious child, 
bent over my desk. My room in 


the apartment had the satne 
old things on the walls it always 
had: drawings of Demeter and 
Aphrodite from the Greek 
Myths phase, pictures from 
the Harry Potter movies. But 
I never· could decide how to 
replace them. I ·came in one 
day to see a poster for the 
Seattle 
International 
Fihn 
Festival hung above my bed. 
He figured I needed something 
current. 
My father moved to San 
Francisco the fall of my senior 
year of high school, but didn't 
sell the apartment until the 
nine months later, after I 
graduated. Busy putting my 
own belongings into boxes 
for the trek to college, I only 
showed up to help him the 
verY.. last day. The apartment 
had been gutted and all that 
•. 
was left to do was move 
the remaining boxes out of 
the basement storage space. 
Lugging files and folders in the 
still heat of August exhausted 
us, so after an hour,.we stopped 
to have a drink with some ·of 
my father's friends who lived 
on the other side of Broadway. 
Sitting on the porch with three 
gay men, I felt the detachment 
of an anthropologist, involved 
yet marginal. I ate more chips 
and guacamole than the three 
of them put together because I 
didn't have as much to say. 
Back at the apartment, I 
was impatient to finish the last 
round of loa · 
up. Carrying 
my fathees boxes to the curb,· 
I thought of my own boxes 
geu ing shipped off to my 
dorm room at Yale, and how 
little attention I'd given to what 
I would put up on the walls. At 
first, I had planned on pursuing 
an aesthetic 
my father had 
brought table runners and 
mood lighting and 
candle 
holders made of sea glass to 
college 
but quickly discarded 
the idea as overcalculated. I 
settled for shoving a few travel 
postcards and a painting of 
the Cascade Mountains into 
the bottom of my suitcase and 
calling it a day. 
Tired 
sweaty, 
we 
trudged up to the second-floor 
apartment one last titne. At 
the entrance, I kicked off my 
flip-flops to walk barefoot on 
the hardwood. Light flooded 
the open space. Our silence 
sounded without the mute 
of visual interference, and 
not knowing what else to do, 
I sat down in the center of 
the room. Even from where 
he stood by the window, 
my father loomed over me, 
enormous. This is it, I thought. 
This is what I've wanted, to 
be surrounded by bare walls. 
This is not something worth 
wanting. But here, with our 
accessories packed up in boxes, 
I felt an unfarniJiar comfort. In 
the moment before my-father 
stepped 
forward 
to 
kneel 
down beside me, our eyes 
locked across the width of the 
apartment, a tilted plane of 
contact m an empty room.
