~-"I just remember being like, 
wait! Wait! What's going on? It 
was a paradigm shift- that Jesus 
can talk to people no matter what 
their background is." Michelle's 
mom had been Catholic, her dad 
had been Buddhist, and she'd 
never really been either. 
''I was raised nothing," she 
tells me. With Alan's stray 
suggestion, she found something. 
Chris and Leah are constant 
thinkers. They started sharing 
religion as part of an intellectual 
bargain. Do they ever have 
arguments about their beliefs? 
"Oh rny goodness, we have 
them all the tirne!" Leah tells me.

and they often disagree. So, 
recently, they made a deal. As they 
tell me about, Chris and Leah go 
from holding hands to playing a 
feisty game of thumb war. 
"I wanted bim to dance with 
me at the Yale Political Union 
~ 
Ball. So I told him if he went to 
ballroom dancing with me for 
two hours, I would go to Mass 
with him. I'm still not Catholic, 
but he knows how to waltz!" She 
laughs. 
Chris looks at her. 
"You went on holy days," he 
says, "which I really appreciated." 
The thurnb war continues. 
''As much as I make fun of 
Mass," Leah notes, ''I'm also 
pretty glad I go now. It's an 
important part of Chris' life. 
And I like being able to have 
argurnents." 
Chris' face breaks into a smile. 
can be difficult. After 
Michelle's freshman year, she 
and her big brother sat together 
outside, watching the Perseid 
Meteor shower. 


"I just kind of popped it 
up, like, 'By the way, I think I 
. 
might've become Christian in the 
past couple months,"' she recalls. 
Her brother was surprised. He 
pushed back. 
''He started asking questions 
· like 'How do you know the 
difference between God's love 
and people's love?' and 'Why does 
-
the world keep turning if people 
don't believe?' These questions 
got me pretty flustered." 
As Michelle speaks. today, she 
waves her hands around to help 
explain. Alan watches her closely. 
"I would try to answer, and it 
would be pretty circular," she says. 
"I kept referring to this 'litnitless 
feeling' that was 'pooling from 
this ocean of love,' and I just got 
flustered, and really frustrated, 
because I thought, 'you're asking 
the wrong questions!"' 
She calms as she comes 
to her conclusion: It took her 
brother a minute to grasp, but 
he understood her· conviction. 
It wasn't that he didn't support 
her choice, but simply that he 
wouldn't have made it for hi tnself 
"For hirn," Michelle 
told me, "ever 
· g, even down 
to feelings, can be explained by 
science, something other than 
God." And for him, that was 
enough. 

For Chris, God and rationality 
both serve important roles in 
the world; he's· quick to ·apply 
academic rigor to his faith. 
"I did a lot of research on 
the historicity ofJesus and the 
Gospels, and it was a hypothesis I 
could· believe in," he· explains. 
Leah coughs a little, and Chris 
reaches out to pat her on the back 
and continues, "The· historical 
arguments are there~ I believe in 
Jesus as a man and as a part of 
the conception of the Trinity and 
God. I try to critically evaluate 
each Gospel claitn." 
Leah begs to differ. 
"I've never really seen a 
persuasive case" for God, she tells 
me, and, looking at Chris, adds, 
"despite many efforts." 
She rubs his head. He rubs 
hers. 
PARENTS 
have ideas of their own. Chris' 
parents are very religious. Leah's 
parents are very much not. Her 
nineteenth-century ancestors 
were among the Europeans first 
printing Ernile Zola's radically 
socialistic, naturalistic books. 
If Leah ever converted to 
Christianity, I ask, would her 
parents support it? 
"Oh, they'd kill me," she 
exclairns. 
Just don't tell Chris' mom. She 
wants Catholic grandkids, and 
Chris is under some pressure to 
supply. Ms. Pagliarella, however, 
approves of Leah, even if she 
holds out hope that she'll convert. 
Chris explains that his mom and 
dad have gotten used to the idea 
of Leah. ''You'd think it'd be 
problematic that I'd bring home a 
liberal, bisexual, atheist Jew from 
Long Island," but despite it all, 
his parents have gladly welcomed 
Leah into their home on breaks. 
If she doesn't keep the kids from 
growing up Catholic, eve.t;ything 
will be just fine. 

That works for Leah. She · . 
won't keep them from growing up 
anything they don't want to be. "I 
wouldn't stop hitn from taking the 
children to church," she explains. 
"I· should be strong enough in my 
truth c1aitn that it shouldn't be 
hurt by the fact that somebody 
saw the Cross." 
Michelle's mother, too, had 
oplllions. 
"My morn and I have this 
running joke that boys need to 
'apply' to be my boyfriend, and 
when I went home she really 
expressed concern about me 
dating Alan." 
Alan had plans to follow his 
religion to wherever it led him, 
and this wasn't safe enough for 
Michelle's mom. Faith did not 
guarantee a lucrative job, and 
Michelle's mother knew this. 


"She was like, 'you need to 
be financially stable,"' Michelle 
explains. 
When Michelle came home 
. after break, she told Alan what 
her mom had said. '~nd he 
was just like, 'if there's an 
· g 
that could break us up, it's your 
mom."' 
Alan's face gets serious and 
he nods. He stars speaking 
slowly. "I guess I should imagine 
more what it might feel like to 
be your mom," he says. "Like, I 
came on a boat from Vietnam 
and created a life for my family. 
I sacrificed a lot to make sure 
Michelle had ever 
· g she 
wanted and needed to succeed, 
and now she's at Yale University 
and she seems to be floating, 
because she met this boy, talking 
this jivetalk about Jesus, but he 
doesn't have a concrete way to 
take care of my daughter-:-" and 
here ~~Alan pauses, then speaks for 
.· .. 
hirnself. '~d I think that's a valid 
question." He sighs, looks up · 
and away, put his hands under his 
knees and sits on them. 

THE FUTURE 
then, isn't always clear. 
But the couples I spoke to 
couples have faith that it's going 
to be O.K. 
"I worry about things 
sometirnes." Alan tells me, then 
turns back to look at Michelle. "I 
get anxious when I think about · 
what it would mean for my life 
and your life if we decided to 
stick together for the long haul." 
Michelle plays with the side of 
her chair and looks towards the 
far corner of the room. 
'~s in, how could we do that, 
where following where Jesus 
might take us, knowing that we 
could be in the suburbs of a 
major city, but could also be in a 
slun1 in India!" 
Michelle laughs now. Alan 
does, too. 
"Just to make an extreme 
point," he clarifies. "I ask myself 
a lot of hard questions about well, 
~an, you do have crazy ideas 
about your life, do you realize 
Michelle might not want to live in 
Fellowship Place for a year while 
you are chaplain, Michelle might · 
not want to go to Washington 
state and work with incarcerated 
prisoners, she might actually want 
to settle down and have a family!"' 
He pauses, then continues. 
"Or, I think, 'you might 
actually want to settle down and 
have a family, Alan!"' 
Michelle looks up; she's 
surprised. She smiles _at Alan. She 
looks back down towards the 
floor. 
Alan explains a little more 
of the dangers the two of 
them might face. A life spent 
in religious service isn't always 
lucrative. 
"It's like the security of the 
American dream, tossed out the 
window." He holds his arms out 
in front of hitn, to demonstrate . 
"Like, "SECURITY!" and toss 
it out, five stories down." 
Michelle laughs again. No 
matter their circumstances, it 
seems, they'll be keeping tabs on 
each other. 
We talk about a lot," she says. 
Alan agrees. 
"We have a library of 
conversations we need to talk 
about," he says. "But it bodes well 
for the future if we have things 
to talk about in restaurants when 
we're old." · 
Michelle smiles. "I have this 
overwhelming feeling that this is 
solid," she says. · 
We can pray for the best.
