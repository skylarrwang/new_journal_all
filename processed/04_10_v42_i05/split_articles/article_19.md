us inspire the young people to 
explode in the midst of worship, 
Lord God. Make us ready, Lord 
God!" 

They release hands and 
assume their appropriate positions 
at instruments or microphones. 
Jason gives the go-ahead, and the 
music begins. 
Is it enough to gather in this place?The worship dancers 
twirl across the floor and make 
sweeping movements with their 
arms as if reaching to heaven. 
Is it enough to lift your hands in 
praise? The singers belt into their 
microphones, eyes closed, rocking 
back and forth. You want it all: my 
spirilj mind and heart. Amidst this 
emQtional scene, Dwight seems 
strit:ngely collected. He leans over 
his~ keyboard like a brain surgeon 
over his patient, meticulously 
following the notes on his music. 

Dwight loosens up a little 
bit for the next song. He taps 
his foot bobs his head, and in a 
rare moment of impulsiveness 
even sweeps his fingers across 
the keyboard. Perhaps because 
he's had to improvise so much 
in his life, Dwight adrnits he 
is mildly uncomfortable with 
musical spontaneity. He likes to 
have a plan, a blueprint that lets 
bitn know exactly what to do and 
when to do it. 
"I don't like to be 
vulnerable," he explains.

After rehearsal ends, 
Dwight and I jump in his silver 
2003 Chrysler and drive to his 
home on Westminster Street. 
Painted onto his leg. 
"Sit, Elliot! You know 
better!" The dog drops to the 
floor for a few seconds before 
Dwight as a young trurnpeter 
surrounded by a snowy white 
picket fence, Dwight's house is 
inviting and homey. As we pull 
up behind the house Dwight 
rnutters something about needing 
to rake the "damn lea es," but 
otherwise he seems vet} proud 
of his home. He unlocks the door 
and a fluffy white dog catapults 
hopping up on my leg instead. 
"Elliot!)' D-wight warns. 
The dog hits the ground. "Elliot's 
my daughtees dog, but for some 
reason that I can't figure out, he 
likes me the best. Oooh," Dwight 
says, remembering something. He 
rnotions for me to come to the 
mantle. "C'mere I want to how 
you this." 
He holds up a faded 
photograph of a woman and a 
man standing in front of a brick 
building with a fire escape snaking 
down the exterior. The pair is 
nicely dressed- the man in a suit 
arid the woman in a skirt suit and 
hat with lacey appliques. Only the 
woman is smiling. 
"My parents," Dwight says, 
nearly whispering. 

Born November 6th, 1956, 
to Elmore and Dora Dickerson, 
Dwight was the ninth of ten 
children. Five were from Elmore's 
previous marriage and lived out 
of the house, while Bernice, 
Patricia, Donna, Dwight and 
Betty all grew up together in the 
Dickersons' cramped apartment 
in the _Morrissania neighborhood 
of the South Bronx. Dwight's 
mother stayed home to take care 
of her gaggle of children while 
his father worked as a mechanic 
for Con Edison Light and Power. 
Later, Elmore opened two 
UnoleurnÂ·tile and carpet stores 
where the Dwight and his older 
siblings worked after school. 
Then, as now, poverty 
and desperation reigned in 
Morrissania. When Dwight played 
outside he had to watch for 
hypodermic needles discarded by 
neighborhood junkies and avoid 
known gang territories. Once 
Dwight was carrying groceries 
home when a group of men 
cornered him, guns cocked, and 
demanded he hand over all of his 
money. Though he immediately 
surrendered his wallet, the teens 
shot him in the thigh as they left. 
"Went straight through," Dwight 
informs me. After that, the pulse 
of gunshots often resonated in 
his head when he tried to sleep at 
night. 

Dwight credits a different kind 
of beat for keeping hitn out of 
trouble: music. When Dwight was 
nine, his father presented hitn 
with a guitar. Dwight mastered 
the riffs and chords so quickly 
that before a year had passed he 
was invited to play at his church's 
Sunday folk mass. Elmore 
scrounged to pay for lessons for 
his son. Before long Dwight had 
mastered the tenor sax, piano and 
accordion. While his friends from 
the neighborhood fooled around 
beneath the tracks of the Third 
Avenue elevated train, Dwight 
fooled around on his collection of 
mstruments. 
"I owe a lot to my Dad for 
introducit).g me to music," Dwight 
says with a sigh. "Paying for my 
music lessons was pretty much 
the only thing my Dad did that 
showed he had any faith in me. 
Otherwise he just told me I was 
good for nothing. That's part of 
the reason I am so determined to 
finish college." 
At ten years old, 
Dwight joined a newly formed 
competitive drum and bugle corps 
then called the Morrissanian 
Lancers .. Within a year, he had 
honed his skills enough to 
become the lead horn soloist. 
Dwight credits his involvement 
with the corps for keeping hiln 
"off the streets," though his tirne 
with the Lancers was also the 
closest he carne to being on them. 
At its foundation, the Lancers 
was a fusion of two Morrissanian 
street gangs - the Savage Skulls 
and the Imperial Bachelors. To fit 
in, Dwight felt he needed to join 
one. He picked the "Bachelors," 
where he eventually became the 
warlord, the leader of the gang. 
"They picked me as 
warlord because I was the least ... 
assurntng," Dwight remembers, 
his lips curling into a smug smile. 
"Everyone thought I was just a 
god-fearing, goody two-shoes 
Catholic school boy, which was 
pa r1 ia11y true. But it meant I could 
fly under the radar." 

Dwight ~sists that the gang 
didn't get in too much trouble. 


Yes, sometitnes they jutnped 
onto the backs of buses to get 
around for free, on occasion they 
"'"smoked herb," but it was the 
70s! Who didn't? The energy that 
most gangs would funnel towards 
violence, however, the Bachelors 
focused on music, teaming up 
with the Skulls to win many 
state and national competitions. 
"I was a lover, not a fighter," 
Dwight admits. Gang tensions fell 
away and the Lancers became a 
close-knit troop with a common 
purpose. Every member counted. 
Once, on the day of 
a competition, his father had 
grounded Dwight for talking 
back. He was sitting forlornly 
on his bed, fingering his Lancers 
uniform - black pants and a red 
satft_l jacket- which he'd laid out 
the night before in anticipation 
of the contest. Suddenly Dwight 
heard a honk and ran to the 
window where he saw two 
big coach buses pull up and 
discharge the Corps director, 
Carmela Saez. Carmela winked at 
Dwight through the window and 
disappeared inside Dwight's front 
door. Dwight's heart beat like a 
snare drum. After a few tninutes 
of suspense, Elmore opened the 
door and said simply: "Go." 
"It was my first experience 
with really feeling valuable - like 
I was part of a larger group. Man, 
if they were willing to drive up in 
two big buses to come get me, I 
must be worth something."

Dwight's experiences 
with the Lancers are still very 
important to him. Dwight picks 
up a multi-photo frame inscribed_ 
with phrases like '"Wow!" '"What a 
night!" '"'"Let the good titnes roll!" 
An adult Dwight stares back from 
the photos, posing with various 
people in a hotel ballroom. 
"This is from a few years 
ago when I was honored by the 
Lancers," he explains, smiling 
down at the frame. "That's my 
wife, Loretta and those are the 
Lancers I used to jam with." 

Dwight served as the lead horn 
soloist for the Lancers until 197 5, 
when he graduated from Cardinal 
Hayes high school, -an all-boys 
catholic institution, and moved to 
Boston to attend Berklee College 
of Music. For two years, Dwight 
thrived on the regimented practice 
schedule, living and breathing in 
scales, majors, and sharps. 
But one day Dwight found 
that he couldn't practice any more. 
Something just felt wrong. Amidst 
the cacophony of horns, strings, 
pianos, and drums emanating 
from the practice rooms, Dwight 
felt empty. He needed more -
more stirnulation, more variety, 
and more choice. 

Dwight took tirne off to 
help with his father's_ business 
in the Bronx before enrolling at 
Howard University, a liberal arts 
institution, in 1979. The transfer 
allowed him to take politics and 
sociology as well as music. He 
loved Howard - he loved living 
in Washington, D.C., he loved 
his classes and his classmates. 
But it didn't last long. After only 
two years at Howard, in January 
1981, Dwight's mother, Dora, 
passed away. Dwight dropped 
out of school and returned to the 
Bronx to support his father and 
help hi tn run his linoleutn and 
carpet warehouses. Only a few 
months later, Elmore married a 
woman with whom Dwight soon 
discovered he'd been having a 
long-term affair, extending back 
far before his mother's death. 
When Elmore passed away 4! 
October of that same year, his 
new wife seized the fam11y's assets, 
leaving Dwight and his siblings 
virtually penniless. 
"It took me fifteen years 
to finally visit his grave," Dwight 
says, picking up a rolled American 
flag he'd taken from Elmore's 
burial site. "I felt a lot of anger 
towards him."
