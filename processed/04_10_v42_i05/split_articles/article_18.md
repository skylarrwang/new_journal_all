53 year-old Dwight Dickerson was accepted to Yale College in part for his "exception-
al background." So why don't niost students know about it? 
, Many Yale undergraduates are 
surpri~ed to encounter Dwight 
Dickerson in their Spanish 
seminars and Political Psychology 
lectures. His usual uniform is 
collegiate enough - black Velcro 
sneakers, blue jeans, a black 
pinstriped button-down left un-
tucked and a grey Yale Bulldogs 
sweatshirt - but his bald head and 
. 
the white hairs salting his pepper 
black mustache suggest he is a 
fair bit older than your average 
undergraduate. 


Dwight sees them 
staring, and sometitnes even 
whispering about what he's doing 
in the classroom. Is he really an 
undergraduate? Perhaps he's just 
auditing? How old is he? 


If he wanted to, Dwight 
coUld volunteer that he is indeed 
an undergraduate - a 53- year-old . 
senior. He could tell them about 
the obstacles he overcame on 
his sinuous path to Yale - how 
he grew up in the poorest area 
of the South Bronx where he 
was once shot in the leg, how 
he had to drop out of Howard 
University when both of his 
parents passed away in the same 
year, or how his father's mistress 
seized his meager inheritance. He 
could reveal how he lost his job 
after September 11th, and had to 
work five temp jobs to stay afloat. 
When his classmates complain 
about their overwhelming slew of 
exams and extra-curriculars, he 
could mention that in addition to 
taking classes~ he works 11 :30pm 
to 6:30am seven days a week 
as an inspector at the Sikorsky 
helicopter plant. He could tell 
them that his ·wife is ill making 
him the sole breadwinner for his 
family of four. 


He could tell them all this if 
he wanted. But Dwight doesn't 
want to draw attention to himself, 
and sensing that his background is 
different, his. younger peers don't 
want to pry. 


When I first met Dwight in my 
discussion section for Colonial 
Latin America, an undergraduate 
history course, I was one of those 
undergraduates too nervous to 
ask him about his background. 
How would I even phrase the 
question, I wondered. How are 
you here? No. Why are you here? 
No, definitely not. Why are you so 
old? Even worse. 


I resorted to asking other 
people in my section about 
Dwight. Though everyone I asked 
was intrigued, no one had any 
answers. One friend responded 
that she had once been in class 
with another older man - his 
name was Robert Johnson '10 
and he was an active duty officer 
in the United States Army. She 
explained that he was part of 
"the Eli Whitney something or 
other", unable to remember the 
program's official name. 


Suspecting that Dwight 
might be part of the satne 
progratn, I visited the website for 
more clues. The most protninent 
item on the strikingly sparse and 
archaic homepage was a video 
titled 'CVoices of the Eli Whitney 
Students Program.'' 


'1:f someone would have 
told me when I was younger ... 
that I would be graduating from 
Yale at the age of 53 ... I would 
have told them that they were 
crazy." Suddenly, I realized that

· I knew that voice: deliberate, 
articulate with pauses for 
reflection. "I would not have had 
an inkling of an idea that that 
would happen to an -individual like 
myself from the South Bronx ... 
But it has." 


Since 2004, Dwight 
has attended Yale as an Eli 
Whitney student. Previously 
known as Yale's Special Student 
program, the Eli Whitney 
Student prograrn accepts "non-
traditional" students to work 
towards Yale bachelor's degrees. 
These students are usually older 
than typical undergraduates 
because their college plans have 
been postponed or interrupted. 
They are selected, according 
to .the prograrn's website, for 
their unique life experiences and 
perspective that 18 to 22 year-old 
undergraduates simply cannot 
offer. 


Past and current Eli Whitney 
students run the garnut from 
Mike Richter, a former goalie 
for the New York Rangers, to 
25 year-old used car salesman-
cum-financial advisor William 
Chmelar and gay rights activist 
Gregg Gonsalves. The prograrn 
garnered international media 
attention in 2006 when former 
Taliban spokesman 
atullah 
Hashemi applied. Hashemi had 
sta1 ted talcing classes at Yale in 
September 2005 on the non-
degree track, and applied for 
degree status -as an Eli Whitney 
April2010 
student in Spring 2006. Possibly 
because of the controversy _ . 
sparked by his presence at Yale 
even as a non-degree student, 
Hashemi was denied from the Eli 
Whitney students program - a 
decision that prompted even more 
press. But in spite of the ample 
coverage of Hashemi, the Eli 
Whitney Students program and its 
participants still remain under the 
radar, relatively mysterious. 


My restraint eroded, I shot 
Dwight an email and asked if he 
would share his story. Instead of 
being offended that I'd violated 
his privacy, Dwight welcomed 
me into his world, insisting that 
I call hirn Dwight instead of Mr. 
Dickerson. 


"I arn more than willing to do 
this," he wrote. ''The question I 
pose is: are you?" 


The following week I find 
myself in a basement classroom 
in Rosenkranz Hall, where Norms 
and Deviance, Dwight's sociology 
class, meets every Monday. Taught 
by renowned ethnographer Elijah 
Anderson, the sen1inar covers 
the origins, development and 
reactions surrounding deviance in 
contemporary soctety. 


Dwight flips deliberately 
through his copy of John Hope 
Franklin's autobiography Mirror 
to America. The book details 
Franklin's path from childhood in 
segregated Oklahoma to serving 
as first black president of the 
American Historical society. 
Dwight has coated the book's 
pages with highlighter and penned 
notes. Unlike many undergrads at 
Yale, he actually seems to finish 
his reading. 


Anderson calls on him, and he 
launches into a comment, subtly 
gesticulating as he speaks. 
"I agree with Bianca's 
deduction that in parts of this 
book, Franklin tries to downplay 
his race." Dwight speaks slowly, 
taking ti rne to think and pause, 
picking just the right word. ''But 
even though he never directly 
alluded to it, there wasn't an hour 
where race wasn't an issue." 


"The fact that he's black and 
grew up in the inner city in the 
'60s and '70s gives hin1 a different 
perspective than a lot of the other 
kids in class," explains Professor 
Anderson, Dwight's professor for 
Norms and Deviance. ''But he 
doesn't bring his background into 
his cornrnents much, it just comes 
out with conunenta 1 y." He adds, 
without a hint of irony, "He's a

\·cr} bright young man." 


\\"hile Dwight's two classes last 
semester, Norms and Deviance 
and Colonial Latin 1\merica, 
might seem a light workload to 
your aYerage )ale undergraduate, 
your aYerage Yale undergraduates 
also don't work 6 7 c..lays a week 
from 11 :30 p.m. to 6 a.m. And 
if they did, you would probably 
find those normal Yale students 
sleeping in their free time instead 
of playing piano for the local 
church band, volunteering at 
a program to aid previously 
incarcerated indh iduals readjust 
to everyday life and singing on 
sales-"\vorthy demo CDs.

Lastly, your average Yale 
stuc..lcnts probably don't know any 
of these things about Dwight. 


Both in and out of the 
classroom, when it comes to Eli 
Whitney students, a tacit policy 
of «don't ask don't tell"seems to 
be in effect. Younger Yalies don't 
want to seem rude by peppering 
their older peers with personal 
questions, and the Eli \X'hitney 
students keep quiet, wanting to 
assimilate as best they can. While 
this unofficial system protects 
the privacy of the Eli Whitney 
students, it also fails to honor 
the accomplishments that earned 
them positions at Yale. 


Dwight invites me to spend 
a Saturday with him so I can 
better understand his life outside 
academia. He begins the day at 
9:30 a.m. with band 
rehearsal for Sunday 
services at Church on 
the Rock, a cinderblock 
cube in ).Jew 
Haven's Long Wharf 
neighborhood. 


When! walk 
into the Church's 
airy auditorium, I 
immediately spot 
Dwight on the stage, 
leaning over the piano. 
He is dressed in his 
usual outfit: black 
Velcro sneakers, a black 
turtleneck tucked into 
jeans, and a gold cross 
on a chain. His oft-
worn Bulldogs sweatshirt drapes 
over a front row chair facing the 
stage. 


The room looks more like a 
United 
ations conference room 
than a place of worship. Flags 
from Japan, Brazil, Jamaica and 
Scotland hang on the back wall, 
and there arc no stained glass 
windows, carvings of saints, or 
other religious symbols anywhere 
in sight. The only sign of the 
room's function is an inscription 
carved above the stage: "For my 
house shall be called a house of 
prayer for all nations ... - Isaiah." 


Except for Dwight, a 
drummer, and a sprinkling of 
college-aged girls choreographing 
dances to gospel songs, the space 
is empty. Dwight checks his 
watch. It is pushing 9:50 a.m.; 
practice was slated to start twenty 
minutes ago. Dwight taps his 
foot an."<iously as his band mates 
slowly trickle in. He's on a tight 
schedule, and tardiness can throw 
things off. 


At around 10 a.m. the 
conductor of the Church on the 
Rocks band arrh~es, a tall, broad 
shouldered man named Jason. 
Dwight and Jason hug and slap 
each other on the back before 
Jason puts his arm around Dwight 
and leads him down the stairs 
off the stage. He summons the 
rest of the band, the dancers, and 
the singers to circle up. They join 
hands and .Jason leads the group 
in prayer, so impassioned he is 
almost shouting. 

"Call us forward to 
prepare us, Lord God, soldiers 
in your name Lord God. Let
