Chinese Y a lies I uncensored views of Google Is China controversy 
H
alfway through 
January, Google announced on 
its blog that they would soon 
be taking "a new approach to 
China." The decision was sparked 
by an alleged cyber attack on 
Google's corporate infrastructure. 
The company believed their 
attackers were Beijing government 
officials. 
"We launched Coogle. en in January 
2006 in the belief that the benefits 
of increased access to information for 
people in China ... outweighed our 
discomfort in agreeing to censor some 
results" read the announcement. 
As time passed, however, Google 
continued, "[these} attacks and 
the surveillance thry have uncovered-
-combined with the attempts over the 
past year to further limit free speech on 
the web--have led us to conclude that 
we should review the feasibility of our 
business operations in China. " 
Three months later, in March, 
Google took action. It took a 
stance against China's censorship 
and began redirecting all mainland 
searches to the uncensored 
Google engine based in Hong 
Kong.

On January 13,2010, after four 
years of flying relatively under 
the radar in China, Google's fame 
peaked overnight. Now, it Now, 
Google was more than a search 
engine: it was a controversy. Its 
fame skyi:ocketed overnight. 
Debates araged amongst mong 
bloggers, computer scientists, 
entrepreneurs and human right 
supporters stormed American 
media. The American media 
eagerly followed the drama. Here 
at Yale, the Chinese students' 
panlist was Hooded with heated 
commentary: "It is apparendy the 
conspiracy of some ill-intended 
capitalists and the manipulated 
government to further destroy 
China's international image!" one 
student barked. 
Government-GoogleTensions 
between the government and 
Google tensions had grown 
graduallyhad grown gradually as 
after 2008 as ChinaChina built 
it's so-called "Great Firewall" 
higher and higher .. Thousands 
of blogs and search terms were 
eliminated in the government's 
"anti-pornography campaign." 
Google complied with the the 
governments's censorship 
demands until December 2009, 
when they fell victim to a 
cyber attack that they believed 
originated from Mainland China. 
Further investigation traced 
the attack to an elite Chinese 
university with the nation's top 
computer science program, and 
a vocational school that was a 
feeder of computer specialists to 
the military. It The attack targeted 
the G Gmail accounts of several 
Chinese human right activists. 
These facts put put together 
convinced the Western media of 
the involvement of the Chinese 
government. 
that the Chinese government 
had been involved. 
Google China, for all the 
political controversy it has now 
generated, had less of a force in 
my lifepresence in my life growing 
up in Beijing than the American 
media may have American 
commentators might assume.d. 
Google is certainly a part of the 
Chinese netizen's daily vocabulary, 
but the company doesn't have a 
strong grasp on the market.
