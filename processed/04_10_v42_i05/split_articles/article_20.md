the ~ronx and no money to 
support hirnself, Dwight moved · 
to Bridgeport, Connecticut to 
live with his sister Patricia. There, 
he worked odd jobs at homeless 
shelters and restitution centers 
until meeting Loretta. 

W h en I ask how they met he 
laughs. 
"Well do you want the version 
I tell everyone or the real story?" 
Without waiting for an answer he 
launches into both. 
Dwight's sister lived 
across the street from a woman 
named Doris who ran a 
hairdressing business out of her 
home; Doris· immediately took a 
liking to Dwight and insisted on 
trying to set hirn up. One day she 
dernanded that he come over to 
her house because .there was a 
"nice Christian girl" she wanted 
him to meet. 

"The girl was nice enough, 
but she had this roorrunate that 
came to pick her up. I saw her pull 
up _in her car and I liked what I 
saw. When she rang the doorbell, 
you can bet I made sure to be the 
one who answered it," Dwight 
pauses and shakes his head, 
chuckling. "I always tell people 
that when I opened the door 
Loretta started drooling so much 
I had to ask her if she needed a 
napkin. In reality, it was probably 
the other way around." 
The couple was married 
on Valentine's Day of 1987 in 
Maryland, where they settled so 
D wight could finally finish his 
education at Howard. But Loretta 
was deeply unhappy living in 
Maryland. She missed her friends, 
and above all her church back 
in Bridgeport where her uncle 
served as the pastor. She was 
hom esick. 

"It got to the point where 
I would come home at night after 
work and find her sitting on the 
side of the bed crying," Dwight 
remembers. "Finally, I _asked 'You 
wanna move back?"' 
A close friend of Dwight's 
from Bridgeport put hirn in 
touch with another friend who 
was renting out his apartrnent on 
Auburn Street in New Haven. 
Without even looking at the 
apartment, Dwight and Loretta 
packed up their things and moved 
back to Connecticut, further 
postponing Dwight's college 
plans. 
Suddenly Elliot starts growling 
at the door. ''Elliot! Sit!" A key 
turns in the lock and the door 
opens to reveal a young woman 
overloaded with groceries. 
''A little help?" she asks. 
Dwight rushes to the door 
and takes most of the bags. 
"Lanna, this is Haley. She's 
following me around for a day 
because she thinks I'm interesting. 
Haley, this is m y daughter 
Ta'Lanna." 

Ta'Lanna sets her remaining 
bags on the kitchen counter and 
gives me a once over. "So you're 
stalking hirn for a day?" Laughing, 
she raises an eyebrow and says: 
"His life is not that interesting. His 
kids are all raised and working, he 
has a great job and goes to a great 
school. Sounds pretty easy to me. 
In addition to Ta'Lanna, 
a twenty one year-old junior at 
the University of 
ew Haven, 
Dwight has two other children: 
Chris, a twenty two year-old who 
recendy graduated with a B.A. 
Ta'Lanna, Dwight and Loretta 
in Theater from the University 
of Vermont and Andres, a 
thirty year-old son by a prior 
relationship who now lives in 
Texas with a wife and children. 
For years, Dwight has also 
provided for one of Ta'Lanna's 
friends, Clarissa, whose previous 
home life was in Dwight's 
euphemistic words, ''unhealthy." 
"We give Dad a lot of 
crap for going to Yale," Ta'Lanna 
continues. "Whenever he makes 
a mistake, or adtnits he doesn't 
know something we're like 
'What?! You don't know this?! But 
you go to Y/4 T .EF" Dwight's smile 
fails to mask his exasperation but 
Ta'Lanna rattles on. "He's gotten 
better but he certainly has his 
moments." 
"Lanna)" Dwight warns, in a 
voice that resembles the one he 
used to speak to Elliot. 
"Fine, well can I at least 
tell her the story about you at 
church that one titne? Please?" 

Dwight agrees and the tension 
dissipates as Ta'Lanna begins her 
stor with a laugh . 
"Dad doesn't get a lot of 
sleep so he's constantly 'resting 
his eyes.' At red lights, at the 
dinner table, whate er. Anyway, 
one day at our old church he was 
on stage because he'd played a 
trumpet solo, and he fell asleep 
during the preacher's sermon! The 
preacher was so offended that he 
turned around at one point and · 
shouted: am I BORI G you?!" 

Dwight counters, "Well 
it was 12:01. The sermon was 
supposed to end at 12. That was 
MY time." 
Dwight schedules his life 
down to the minute. If he didn't 
construct a daily plan to follow, 
he might break down, like a 
' helicopter without a blueprint. 

Ta'Lanna has satisfied her 
need to embarrass her Dad and 
Dwight is eager to show me other 
things. "Let me take you to my 
wife's favorite part of the house," 
he says, walking up the stairs. We 
walk down the hall and he opens 
the door to a large bedroom 
decorated in.rich beiges and 
brown. 

"Loretta decorated all 
this," he says, opening the door 
to the bathroom. ''I call this the 
bathroom, but Loretta calls it her 
palace." 

The room is large and airy 
with a bean-shaped Jacuzzi, huge 
vanity mirrors, and a glass-paned 
shower that houses a waterproof 
phone and radio. The sinks and 
ftoors are pink marble and it 
smells faintly of flowers. The 
toilet is hidden from the rest of 
the room, separated by a wall and 
a door. 

"This," Dwight says 
sweeping his hand across the 
room "is why I work." 
He explains that, seven 
years ago, Loretta developed 
gastric fibrosis and had to go on 
disability leave from her job at 
the Yale Child Studies Center. 
For a while she thought she'd be 
able to return to work but then 
the disease triggered problems 
with her pancreas, and on top of 
everything she developed lupus, 
a disease of the immune .system 
that causes joint pain, muscle 
pain, and chronic fevers. 
For the first year Loretta 
stopped working, Dwight had 
a hard titne making ends meet. 
In 2001, Dwight lost his job at 
aviation supplier G KN aerospace 
when they relocated to St. Louis 
after September 11th and for the 
next two years he juggled five 
temp jobs. He worked such long 
hours that he barely saw the 
family he was working to support. 
It was only in 2003, when 
Dwight landed his job at Sikorsky, 
that things got a little bit easier. 
His starting salary at Sikorsky 
was $55,000- more than his old 
illcome combined with Loretta's 
when she could still work - which 
allowed him to quit all his other 
jobs. 

Working at Sikorsky also 
allowed him to fulfill his lifelong 
drearn of finishing school. 
United Technology, the umbrella 
company that owns Sikorsky, runs 
an employee scholar program that 
completely covers the cost of the 
education of all its employees as 
well as offering paid study tirne. 
As an incentive for employees to 
pursue education, the company 
also presents them with a $10,000 
stock option upon completion 
of their bachelor's degree. This 
policy allowed Dwight to enroll at 
Yale, where he is set to graduate 
on May 24th, 2010. 
The ample benefit package is 
not the only reason Dwight loves 
working at Sikorsky. 
"I was born to be a machinist," 
Dwight insists as we walk into 
the plant, a, sprawling compound 
right off of the Merritt Parkway 
in Stratford. "I've always loved 
taking things apart, seeing how 
they work, and putting them back 
together." 
Dwight's role as a final line 
inspector does not require 
active building, but it is just as 
important. Blueprint in hand, 
Dwight scours his assigned 
helicopters millirneter by 
millirneter to make sure every last 
screw matches the plan. It hurts 
his eyes a "heck of a lot" but 
Dwight finds the job extremely 
fulfilling. He knows that if he 
makes one misstep there could 
be dire consequences. The safety 
of the helicopter's future crew 
-whether it be Army men, navy 
men or businessmen - is in his 
hands and on his eyes. 
We begin our tour of the 
Sikorsky plant at the blades and 
spars station. As we approach 
the rows of metal rods, Dwight
