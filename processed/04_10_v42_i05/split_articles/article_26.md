T
he fust figure to greet 
anyone entering my father's 
second-floor apartment was the 
Martini Lady. Printed on poster 
board, she stood with her hip 
jutted, strong-jawed and slouch~ 
in a red strapless cocktail 
dress. Her hair was cut short 
and her raised hand exposed 
an unshaved armpit; I never 
knew if these spiky black tufts 
emphasized Martini's dykiness 
or exposed her to be not a lady, 
but a delicate man. 

Despite her vamping, Martini 
was a welcome sight. Whenever 
I went outside with my father, I 
wanted desperately to get back 
in. Seattle's freeway was a direct 
shot to his apartment, but if he 
needed groceries, we'd detour 
along South Broadway, 
the 
gayest street in the second-gayest 
city in America. My father knew 
everyone on the avenue. As we 
passed men with hoops in their 
earlobes and Calvin Klein briefs 
peeking over their low-slung 
jeans, he'd greet them with a kiss 
on the lips and introduce me, 
hiking his voice into a higher 
register. I was never at ease 
with these men, and I didn't feel 
myself loosen until we turned 
off Broadway and the streets 
took on the same calm feel of 
the sleepy neighborhood where 
I lived six days out of seven 
with my mom. When I finally 
met eyes with Martini, I was like 
a sprinter crossing the capture-
the-flag line from deep in enemy 
territory, safe at last. 

Unlike the house I lived in 
with my mother, my father's 
apartment was furnished by 
selection, 
not accumulation, 
and each room looked torn 
from a catalogue on interior 
design. As early as elementary 
school, I perceived something 
threatening beneath the soft 
lighting and sleek Scandinavian 
furniture. A framed sketch of 
a cartoon king had pubic hair; 
a gridded poster in my father's 
room depicted a finger indenting 
a nipple; in the kitchen, a black 
man licked melted ice cream 
off his partner's balding head. 
~!agazine racks displayed issues 
of 0Ht and GQ, whose covers 
exhibited some variation on 
the words HOT HOT HOT 
superimposed over gleaming 
pectorals. What wasn't on the 
walls, I uncovered myself. Once, 
I grabbed something in my 
father's closet, and a cascade 
of birdseed scattered across 
the floor, leaving me gripping 
an empty leg of pantyhose. He 
explained that he had gone to 
a drag party that weekend, and 
filled them to make breasts. 
Another 
time, 
I 
remember 
handling a familiar Christmas 
tree ornament, and lifting its 
skirt to see two sewn-on jewel 
balls attached beneath a tiny 
beaded penis. 

Every Friday, 
my father 
hung his coat on the rack beside 
Martini and closed the door to 
the apartment. We were home.

from 
one 
of 
the world's most deliberate 
conceptions; my father was the 
accident. He'd agreed at twenty-
eight to donate his sperm to my 
mother, Annette, a forty-year-
old lesbian determined to have 
a biological baby before the last 
slow tick of her biological clock. 
Arranged by a third party, I was 
conceived 
through 
artificial 
insemination. My parents never 
met, nor did they plan to. But by 
the time I reached toddlerhood, 
my mom's partner had split and 
I was down a parent, so she 
decided to invite my father over. 
He showed up with his then-
boyfriend D avid, which caused 
some lingering confusion (Â«My
