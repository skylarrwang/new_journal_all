trying to find a good recipe for 
a chicken dish, will exclaim "I'll · 
Coogle it!" but open Baidu instead. 
Baidu is China's domestic search 
engine. The word Baidu, literally 
meaning "hundreds of times", 
comes from a poem written 
· eight centuries ago. For the 
Chinese, the word it suggests the 
persistent search for the ideal. It 
• 
was l~unched in 2000, six years 
before Google entered China. 
During those six years, millions 
of Chinese families entered the 
digital world and first experienced 
the c·onvenience of having 
endless streams of information 
lie only one just a click away. For 
most Chinese, this convenience -
carries the nametag of Baidu. 
I .ike my mother, when in 
China, I use Baidu when I'm 
home in China. The company 
boasts a tnarket share of 63.9 
0/o while Google owns a mere 
third of that amount. The 2006 
founding of Google China may 
have been a big move for those 
Western investors coveting 
China's fast-growing market, but 
it has barely affected the lives of 
ordinary families like mine. 

Amidst the groWing media 
frenzy, some of my Chinese 
friends scoff. "Google is a big 
company, and they got attacks 
almost everyday, from not just -
China but all over the world. 
Why have they never complained 
until now?" one student wrote to 
Yale's Chinese students' panlist. 
He thinks the move is more 
about saving face than saving 
information. He is not alone in 
his argument. The Global Times, 
China's biggest English-language 
daily newspaper, recendy 
announced that 70 percent of 
Chinese polled believe Google's 
threat to exit China as a result of 
its failure to compete with Baidu. 
Maybe so. But a quick look at 
the cases of other international 
business trying to enter markets 
in Asia reveals that other 
corporate giants like McDonald's 
and Starbucks also struggled for 
years before they finally reached 
their desired market share. The 
process requires initial losses, but 
ultimately pays off. 

From Google's perspective, 
a cost-benefit analysis shows 
litde economic reason to leave . 
In truth, the underperformance 
of its branch in China will barely 
cause the company to sweat: 
Analysts estitnate Google's China 
business is a modest 1 percent. 
to 2 percent of its $6.5 billion 
in annual net profit. But by 
leaving China so soon, Google is 
abandoning the largest potential 
market in the world. 

So if the move is not about 
money, then what's it about? Just 
as Western observers suggest the 
Chinese government was behind 
the most recent cyber attack, 
many Chinese suspect that the 
United States government plotted 
Google's departure from China. 
There has long existed, after 
all,After all, there has long been 
tension between China and the 
US regarding the topic ofissues 
of media freedom. Emails sent 
betweenMany of Yale's Chinese 
students students atsupport this 
"conspiracy theory" rnodel. They 
decriedln recent emails to their 
panlist, they credit Google's move 
as an attempt by US government 
to further destroy China's 
international ilnage. 

Other students view the 
controversy as the result of a 
difference in cultural expectations. 
"Chinese people nowadays tend 
not to believe things the way 
they are told and always suspect 
there are things left unspoken. 
American people, on the other 
hand, do believe, because of 
the transparency of its society," 
Chinese Yale student Ge Yang '10 
pointed out. 

7,000 miles away from Yale, 
Chinese youth, the most avid 
users of Internet, remain mostly 
silent. Besides the bunches 
of flowers left in front of 
Google's Beijing headquarter to 
lament its departure, Google's 
announcement has little brought 
little buzz to China itself. After 
all, With the poor state of the 
job market and skyrocketing 
apartment prices in China, what is 
there to fret over in not being able 
to read about Dalai Lama?
