Taking art classes at Yale 
can be an expensive en-
deavor. Should Yale help 
its art students out? 

The starving artist 
survives on canned beans and 
spends his or her pinched pen-
nies on canned paint instead. The 
image is familiar, cliched. Yale's 
undergraduate Art students are 
by no means starving, but they 
face far higher expenses than our 
other majors do. Liberal arts uni-
versities such as Yale pride them-
selves on their ability to offer 
students nearly absolute freedom 
in crafting their academic careers. 
But for Art students at Yale, this 
freedom comes with a price tag -
literally. 

Yale Art majors have been 
known to purchase up to $1000 
in materials for a single class. 
Art major Chika Ota '11 never 
spends less than $200 on materi-
als each semester; she adds that 
oil painters and photographers 
often spend upwards of $500. 
Art materials are generally more 
expensive than course books, and 
they don't come used. Moreover, 
art students often feel that the 
highest quality materials make the 
highest quality art; if they can't 
afford them, they're at an artistic 
disadvantage. 

In addition to the costs of 
buying personal materials, most 
art classes at Yale require an extra 
class materials fee. These range 
from $25 to $150 - the more 
advanced the class, the steeper 
the price. 

Most art students finance 
their own work through jobs dur-
ing the school year. Ota has two 
jobs that help cover 
the costs. Another art 
student, Fidel Gurrola 
'12, has a job at the Art 
School and digs into 
his personal savings if 
his salary alone can't 
cover the cost of sup-
plies. 

Resources 
like the Digital Media 
Center for the Arts 
(DMCA), a building on 
York Street that houses 
top of the line technol-
ogy for audio, visual, 
and printed work, also 
come with price tags. 

In the DMCA students can rent 
digital cameras, digital video cam-
eras, microphones, field lighting 
and recording equipment -- but 
they must pay to do so. Accord-
ing to Ken Lovell, the Associate 
Director of the DMCA, this 
is the school's way of showing 
tough love. The facility exists, he 
explains, "to train people to do 
the work themselves" instead of 
paying someone else to do it for 
them, ultimately helping them to 
become more self-sufficient art-
ists. He said, "their mission is to 
show you how to do your work, 
not to do your work for you." 

Even keeping that in mind, it's 
hard to imagine how students 
on financial aid could afford to 
take Yale's undergraduate art 
courses. Though the school often 
subsidizes academic books for 
students on financial aid, they 
will not chip in towards the costs 
of art fees or materials. Van As-
sen, a member of the Art School 
faculty, explains that it would be 
difficult for Yale to fund under-
graduate work because the costs 
of projects can vary so greatly 
between classes and students. 
"Some person might require 
a lot of material, and another 
person very little and both could 
be equally good for 
equal reasons. It's 
better for students 
to take responsibil-
ity for their expens-
es," he said. 

Our rival Uni-
versity has a dif-
ferent take on the 
matter. At Harvard, 
Art majors are not 
expected to fund 
equipment or ma-
terials for any class. 
Instead, they are 
given a budget for 
the semester, usu-
ally between $150 
to $600, to use at their discretion. 

Harvard Art student Isidore 
Bethel '11, expressed that this 
stipend has helped the art major 
from becoming financially exclu-
sive. Bethel is on a full scholar-
ship at Harvard, and said that the 
Art department's subsidies were 
one of the reasons he chose the 
school in the first place. 

The difference in subsidy rais-
es questions about Yale's invest-
ment in their artists. The Uni-
versity has produced successful 
artists from both its undergradu-
ate and graduate programs, such 
as sculptor Jessica Stockholder 
MFA '85, who is now a faculty 
member of the Yale School of

Art. If the school values their 
contribution, some students 
wonder, why don't they fund it? 
Science students don't have to pay 
for their lab space, their equip-
ment, or their chemicals. Why 
should art students be forced to 
pay for their paint and clay? 

This year the art depart-
ment counts 50 majors who were 
not deterred by the costs of pur-
suing their craft. 

"Students are willing to 
set aside certain things that will 
allow them to do whatever they 
are passionate about." Van Assen 
explained. He sees it as a "matter 
of making choices." According to 
him, the ideal students will give up 
the luxuries that their peers enjoy 
in order to pursue their craft. 

To Van Assen's pleasure, 
and to the credit of many of 
the faculty within the art school, 
many Yale art students agree that 
the work they produce is worth 
the costs. Instead of shelling out 
cash for summer travels or unpaid 
internships, some Art students 
work all summer long to make 
enough to buy that new camera or 
new set of paints that they need. 
Others are particularly economi-
cal with their spending during 
the school year. "I don't really 
buy anything I don't need," Ota 
says. Many art students don't view 
this frugal lifestyle as a punish-
ment, but rather an unavoidable 
trade off in order to pursue what 
it is that they love. "What I am 
spending now is very important 
for building a portfolio for later," 
says Fidel Gurrola '12, who hopes 
to be a graphic designer after 
graduation. 

Gurrola's passion is ad-
mirable, but for some students, 
passion can't pay the bills. If 
our University wants to keep its 
talented artists, then it should not 
make its artists give up so much 
for their work. 

While the starving artist-
in-training sentiment may have 
its place, it isn't at Yale. Yale has 
money. The artists have talent. 
Yale wants talent. Student artists 
need money. It's in the Universi-
ty's hands to strike an even trade.
