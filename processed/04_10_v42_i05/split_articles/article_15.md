' and scruffy. He's wearing a dirty 
white tank top, a blue denirn 
jacket, and sandals. When he 
reaches the library's double front 
' 
doors, he pulls. Nothing. He 
pulls again, then tries the other 
door. He looks around, slowly 
)Urns back and proceeds slowly 
down the steps, hands in his 
pockets. He leans against a railing, 
standing idly, looks around for a 
minute, moves to the edge of the 
-sidewalk. He watches, as if about 
to cross the street, but several 
minutes pass and no traffic blocks 
his path. 

Finally, I approach him. 
'Were you trying to go into the 
library?" I ask. 
He looks at me. Pauses . 
. 
Slowly, he responds: "No, no." 
I thank hirn. I walk away. A 
minute later, he crosses the street 
onto the Green, and he's gone. 

In the next twelve minutes, 
fourteen people try to enter the 
library. Some arrive by car or 
bike, but rnost are on foot. A 
mom drops off her high school 
\ 
daughter in a white pickup truck. 
A minute later, the girl is back, 
dur nping her iPod and books in 
the car. "They open at noon," 
she says, though I see no such 
indication. 

Only a tall man in a red 
pril2010 
-
shirt expresses disappointment 
before leaving. He arrives· alone, 
tugs on the doors a few times, and 
grunts loudly before heading back 
to the Green. 

When I return on a 
Wednesday afternoon, I meet 
Alberta Taylor standing idly on 
the steps. She has just left the

library. ''I was trying to learn 
how to take care of my math," 
she tells me. She's been going to 
school 
adult classes 
for the 
last two years, though she hasn't 
been going recendy because she's 
working as a full-rime babysitter. 
Her friends would use the library, 
too, she says, if they were ''out 
here." But, she adds ''I don't have 
~ 
friends no more. Some of them 
are locked up." 

Taylor stands in the middle 
of the stairs for a while, no\v one 
of the small crowd of library 
loiterers, and I go inside. 

The 
ew Haven Library, 
like the books it holds, doesn't 
change much each day. The arne 
people visit. The same man sits at 
the same table in the back corner 
of the first floor reading room. 
flis name is George Nelson, and 
he's leaning back in his chair. 
Nelson visits the library every 
other day, mostly to use M ySpace _ 
and Facebook, as he 9oesn't have 
a computer at home in Hamden. 
He far prefers the New Haven 
library to the Hamden one, 
though. Here, he says, "I know 
everybody." He sees friends from 
he graduated two years 
back and now works busing tables 
at the Omni Hotel 
and family. 

While we're talking, he sees his 
cousin across the room and stops 
to greet her. 

Nelson sees all the same 
people every day, doing the 
sa_me things. And he sticks to his 
routine: He uses the computers. 
"No books," he says as 
soon as I mention the library's 
other offering. Nelson isn't alone 
in passing on books. The larger 
attraction at the library is its mass 
of free computers 
one needs 
only a library card to access one 
of the seventy-five machines. 
They're hea\-1.ly used by visitors, 
especially by those looking for 
jobs in this hostile economy. In 
recent years, many jobs have 
required applicants to complete 
all application materials online, so 
those who don't own computer 
come to the library. The library

maintains a jobs task force with 
resolirces for the unemployed. 

But there are also the 
willful few who stick to reading. 
In the back of the library's 
main level, Everett Echols leans 
over the WallS treet Journal. He 
. is surrounded by books and 
newspapers. Under the Journal is 
the New York Times; next to him

WAITING FOR 
GO DOT. 

is a bulky tome titled Principles of 
Corporate Finance, which he says is 
his favorite book. 

Like Nelson, Echols comes to 
the library every day. He sits at the 
same table every day 
unless it's 
taken. He sees "the same crowd 
every day." He arrives around 
noon 
"I get up, I eat, then I 
come here" 
and stays until 
closing. "Usually people have their 
routine," he says. This is his. 

Echols has been retired for 
twenty years. Born and raised in 
Cleveland, Echols never went 
to college, instead working at 
McDonald's and in several other 
jobs in the service industry. He 
came to 
ew Haven many ears 
ago to work on Long Wharf, 
loading and unloading. 

Now, Echols checks out 
five or six books every week. He 
reads about history, economics, 
philosophy, mathematics, and 
physics. "I like to read," he 
says several times. He started 
with Waitingfor Godot. which he 
picked up off a shelf in a library 
in Cleveland for no particular 
reason. "I just continued reading." 

He moved on to Sartre, Camus, 
Virginia Woolf. He doesn't like 
fiction much anymore 
turning 
instead to works like Principles of 
Corporate Finance. 

Echols doesn't talk to 
others at the library, though he 
recognizes many of the people 
there. The library offers a variety 
of programs for its visitors, but 
Echols has never gone to any. He 
talks quietly, slowly. It's clear he'd 
like to get back to his reading. I let 
him, and leave him to the quiet.
