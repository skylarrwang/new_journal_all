A frequently asked question these 
days is "When will Kingman Brewster 
step down?" Rumor has it that he will 
depart soon. The Yale he leaves will be 
vastly different from the one he inheri-
ted in 1963. We hope that this issue of 
The New J oumal will cause people to 
reflect on how Yale has changed in the 
last decade. Brooks Mather Kelley, 
the author of the main article, gradua· 
ted from Yale in 1953 Sl!.d received his 
Ph.D. in history from the University 
of Chicago in 1960. Last March he 
published Yale, A History, which 
ended with A. Whitney Griswold's 
death. Kelley realizes the risks invol· 
ved in analyzing a current presidency. 
He admits, "Over a period of time, 
some things I have stressed in my ar-
ticle may not seem as important as 
they do now." 

The New Journal will set aside 
space in its next issue for responses to 
the Brewster article.


**Title: Our brother's thinker?**

On May 5, 1972, John McGuerty, 
Director of the New Haven City Plan 
Department, went to Yale's 
Woodbridge Hall to discuss 
with Yale officials the plans for two 
new residential colleges which the 
university hoped to build on Grove 
and Temple Streets. He was anxious 
for the meeting; McGuerty wanted 
to assure, among other things, that 
the new buildings would not disrupt 
the surrounding area. But when he 
entered Woodbridge's second-floor 
Corporation Room he found laid out 
on the long table a minutely detailed 
scale model of the proposed complex. 
From the first, McGuerty had objec-
tions to the model, but theY ale of-
ficials present made it clear to him 
that the plans were in a very ad· 
vanced stage and could only be 
changed at great expense. The uni-
versity would begin its final working 
drawings and construction, he was 
told, as soon as the New Haven 
Aldermen approved the plan. 

But the Aldermen never approved 
the plan and the university has 
temporarily laid plans for the two

Haven relationship during Kingman Brewster's 
administration; John Etra ponders the moral and 
aesthetic implications of a hatless Brewster.
