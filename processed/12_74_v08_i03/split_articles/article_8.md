**But the King Wears No Crown**

Power inspires a multitude of hats.
If we consider the innumerable
positions, legitimate and ex officio,
occupied by the President of Yale, it
would be no trivial matter to catalogue
the concomitant assortment of hats
so Byzantine an eminence implies.
One envisions a hat box as big as
Beinecke, a special wing of Woodbridge
to contain the load. Curiously,
however, Mr. Brewster has chosen
otherwise. Sans fedora, sombrero,
panama, and fez, he is consistently
hatless. There is no tangible hat in
his life.

Of course for graduation he poses in
the sporty Oxford cap and at late
season games waves his sturdy
Russian black fur for the fans. A
rather amorphous beige cotton rain
hat is also reported from time to time
in his keeping. But all told these
amount to little in the great cranial
equipage of eternity, the head cover-
ing struggle of our race.

True, the hat is not indispensible
even to the traditional titular
authority. Did Caesar wear a hat?
Was Einstein hatted at the discovery
of relativity. Witness Adam at the
creation-is there a hat? Hatlessness
is by no means a stigma, clearly not
at all the social indiscretion of let us
say shoelessness, facelessness or
mindlessness. And yet one may in
the long run expect something by
way of a boater or deerstalker from
the PRESIDENT OF YALE. Some-
thing by way of a concession to the
role, not ostentatious or gaudy, but
in keeping with the high stature and
miasma of place, something is cer-
tainly in order. Indeed, not as a mere
gesture to tradition, but as vividly
functional appendage, a cranial buf-
fer against the contemptuous on-
slaught of time and change.

But I would not force circum-
stance upon anyone bold enough to
resist. If Mr. Brewster would breast
the elements bareheaded, unhouselled
and resolute, why then so be it. I
salute him. Why be encumbered by
the ineffective cranial baggage of the
past, the cerebral cloth of our
mortality?

And returning again to Dr.
Suess, in the end hatlessness may be
the greatest of all labors. As Bar-
tholomew Cubbins' agon irrevocably
details, the turmoil of achieving
hatlessness is the difference twixt
innocence and understanding. And
for such vision in our own aspiring
leader, we must all tip our
hats in applause.
