For the Old Blue: 
committees and concessions 
As the university entered the 1970's (amid a 
sudden "eerie tranquility" after the events of the 
spring), there were many recommendations in the 
air to make Yale a better place. Commissions had 
been at work studying alumni relations and 
university governance. The Study Commission on 
Governance was appointed by Brewster in 1969 
when numerous complaints about the conduct of 
the university were in the air. It reported at 
length in 1971. The commission detailed a wide 
variety of ways in which the university could pro-
vide better information about decisions at all 
levels and allow greater participation by all mem-
bers of the community in decision-making. Many 
of its recommendations were, in fact, never 
enacted. But several important changes were 
made. On April2, 1971 the Yale Corporation 
voted 12 year terms for Successor Trustees (they 
had previously held office until the commence-
ment following their sixty-eighth birthday). The 
Corporation specifically rejected a commission 
recommendation for the election of two trustees 
by students and faculty because they feared that 
would create "special constituents." They also 
instructed the Yale officers to respond promptly 
to the recommendation for four all-university 
councils (on priorities and planning, institutional 
policies, investment and finance, and operations 
and services), but only the council on priorities 
and planning has been created as of this writing. 
The Corporation at the same meeting requested 
the University Secretary, Reuben Holden, to 
make a specific proposal for a news bulletin. Out 
of this vote came the Yale Weekly Bulletin and 
Calendar in the fall of 1972 -a much improved 
form of the old university calendar. The Corpora-
tion lastly asked the deans of the schools to get 
the response of the faculties to aspects of the 
report which affected them. 

A year later the chairman of the commission's 
monitoring committee (appointed for a year) re-
ported that while some parts of their report had 
been accepted, and some were being considered, 
"others seem to have been ignored." He noted, 
however, that because the commission had been 
working at a time of particular crisis, some of their 
recommendations were already "dated-or even 
passe." Still, the chairman found that junior 
faculty were playing a larger role in decision-
making, students were being consulted more fre-
quently, and progress had been made in devel-
oping "appropriate disciplinary bodies designed 
to safeguard individual rights yet to protect the 
commonweal in cases of infractions of University 
rules by either faculty or students." 

Chairman Jaroslav Pelikan overlooked or ig-
nored, however, the poor handling of the case of 
Kenneth Mills-a leader of the black faculty 
during the May Day period. Mills was found in 
1972 to be holding a full-time tenure position at 
the State University of New York at Stony Brook 
while still working full-time at Yale. Mills was 
suspended for a year but always claimed that he 
did not get "due process." While the ultimate 
decision of the university was probably right, had 
the case been referred to an all-university tribunal 
as recommended by the Governance Commission 
the sense that justice had been done might have 
been greater. 

The problem with the alumni was of more im-
mediate danger to the university, however, than 
the problem of governance. Alumni can be useful 
to any college or university in a wide variety of 
ways, of course, but the most important of all is 
through their financial support. Yale's alumni 
were beginning to withhold some of their dollars 
from alma mater. So the worsening Yale finan-
cial situation prompted actions to pacify the 
graduates. Undergraduate admissions procedures 
were altered to admit more athletes and the 
children of "Old Blues." Having pushed neces-
sary admissions changes too rapidly, and perhaps 
even somewhat too far in the early sixties, Yale 
now found itself forced into a sizeable retreat. But 
the first step was to reorganize the alumni body 
following the recommendations of the report on 
the Commission on Alumni Affairs, usually 
known as the Dwyer Commission, its chair-
man, and a feasibility study under the leadership 
of George B. Young. 

Though Bishop Paul Moore, Jr., a Fellow of 
the Corporation, joked that changing the alumni 
organization was "like rearranging the deck chairs 
on the Titanic," the plan for an Association for 
Yale Alumni was given the go-ahead by the Yale 
Corporation in October 1971. The new group was 
given overall responsibility for coordinating alum-
ni-related boards and its chairman was given the 
right to attend meetings of the Institutional 
Policy Committee of the Corporation and other 
committees as necessary. A complicated system 
was worked out whereby all of the university's 
alumni would be represented in an assembly of 
350 delegates. But the most important product of 
the reform was the Governing Board, which would 
exercise the powers of oversight and coordination 
of alumni activities and which, in the provost's 
words, would provide "an effective link between 
Yale and all her alumni." Endicott P. Davison 
(B.A. 1945), appointed to the newly created post 
of Director of Institutional Development and 
Capital Support in 1971, was to be the chief 
alumni liaison on campus. He put the purposes 
of the organization more crudely: "Alumni will 
now have clout that they never had before." 

Undergraduate admissions were undoubtedly

the key area of alumni concern. By the 1970's the 
university was beginning to try to show that it 
really cared about the children of its graduates. 
The Office of Institutional Research released a 
report showing that by 1971 Yale-affiliated ap-
plicants in the middle applicant pool-where most 
individuals fall- had a five times better chance of 
acceptance than those with no Yale relatives. 
President Brewster began to express his con-
cern as well. In his annual report for 1971-72, he 
finally admitted that the admissions office had not 
paid enough attention to alumni relationships. By 
that time, R. Inslee Clark had resigned and pres-
sures for change were building. Throughout the 
years 1969-73, however, alumni children remained 
at a level of about 13-15 per cent of each entering 
class. Under the insistence of the AYA, however, 
things began to change. In the fall of 1973 the 
alumni group called for an increase of the children 
of graduates in each class to "a figure closer to 20 
or 22 per cent." The AYA chairman, Frederick P. 
Rose (B.E. 1944), said, "It's necessary to elimi-
nate the impression created by the admissions of-
fice of previous years that Yale is not interested in 
alumni children." While the dean of admissions 
considered the 20 per cent figure "unrealistic" 
based on the present applicant pool, the president 
directed that alumni children be actively en-
couraged to come to Yale. One way or another, 
the class of 1978 had the highest number of the 
sons and daughters of graduates in many years-
nearly 20 per cent of the class. 

"Old Blues" had also been concerned about 
what seemed to them a noticeable decline in Yale's 
prowess on the athletic field. Here, too, the presi-
dent, while carefully hedging his statement, 
declared that "the Corporation members do wish 
to eliminate every financial or other handicap to 
the admission of scholar athletes." Positive 
weight, Dean of Admissions Worth David was 
told, was to be given to athletic distinction in the 
appraisal process. Brewster also wanted each 
class to have more scientists, more New Haven 
students, more minority students, and better 
geographic distribution.

A million dollar windfall 
but the crisis remains 
Whatever else might be said about these 
moves-and it is still too early to tell what effect 
they will have on Yale or its graduates-two 
things were clear: an attempt was being made to 
woo the alumni back to caring about Yale, and the 
university (by that one would have to mean Brew-
ster) was making a broad retreat from its earlier 
position. "Inky" Clark had felt that Brewster and 
the Corporation wanted a more diverse and intel-
lectually stronger student body. Clark had 
specifically rejected geographic representation as 
an element in the make-up of classes. In 1970, 
Brewster had said there was no intention of hav-
ing any consolidation or retrenchment in the ad-
missions procedure. Now the change was on. 

The reason, of course, was the financial situa-
tion. The shift from good times to bad had first 
been indicated in the fall of 1969 when the first 
cut-backs (in things, rather than people) had 
begun. But the real problem only became appar-
ent in the spring and summer of 1970. While the 
treasurer stressed at that time the decline in 
alumni giving, other gifts used for operating 
expenses were falling as well. Between 1967-68 
and 1969-70 total "Gifts Availed of for Operating 
Expenses" fell by $1 million. They had undoubted-
ly been budgeted to grow at a rate of at least nine 
per cent along with everything else. The fall in 
income, however, did not stop the rise in expenses.  
The rate of inflation was picking up. The costs of 
medical and fire insurance and social security were 
rising, as were wages, utility expenses, and inter-
est rates. In his report for the frightening year of 
1969-70, the treasurer said that if Yale were to 
continue "at its present pace" the estimated 
shortfall would be $8 million in 1971-72. In Octo-
ber 1970 the Corporation approved a plan for a 
total reduction in "activities and people" of $5.3 
million from the predicted 1971-72 expenses: The 
people of Yale had already been warned. In Sep-
tember they had been told that "virtually all 
aspects of Yale will be required to cut back" and 
this was followed, in October, by a freeze on hir-
ing. The situation did not brighten when, that 
same fall, the city put eleven pieces of Yale's prop-
erty on its tax lists. 

While Yale's various moves to cut expenses 
were helpful, they could not solve the financial 
problem because of the scarcity of gifts for opera-
ting income. Though the alumni fund increased 
slightly in 1970-71, other gifts of this sort again 
declined. Over four years, gifts in this total cate-
gory were down, while university expenses in-
creased by 32 per cent. At the same time, addi-
tional expenses were coming on line. Yale's com-
prehensive health plan, operating from a new $6.7 
million building (not including equipment) went 
into operation in July 1971. The experimental 
Tuition Postponement Option plan, by which a 
student could defer the payment of a portion of 
tuition, and repay it by a percentage charge on 
income after graduation, was instituted for 1971-
72. The president had long talked of such a plan, 
funded by the federal government, but in the face 
of rising tuition it became a necessity. For 1970-
71, tuition and room and board amounted to 
$3,900. A $500 increase was added for 1971-72. 
(In 1964-65 the inclusive fee for resident students 
was $2,800. By 1974, it had reached $5,350.) But 
Yale could not afford to increase its financial aid. 
So Yale turned to its new experimental plan, even 
though there was a risk it might cost money, or 
students, in the long run. 

The deficit for the year 1970-71 was $2.6 mil-
lion; in June 1971 it appeared that the 1971-72 de-
ficit would soar to $6.5 million. The Yale Corpora-
tion realized that the university was in "a major 
financial crisis." It was decided that educational 
costs must be cut 20 per cent from the forecasts 
over the next three years. As part of this pro-
gram, the president appointed a committee, under 
the chairmanship of Professor Robert Dahl, to get 
a fundamental and fresh appraisal of Yale's educa-
tional functions. 

In January 1972 the Corporation announced 
its intention of launching a fund drive after the 
current reviews of the educational and financial 
operations of the university were completed. Yale 
had to get its "own house in order," according to 
Brewster, and should "come forward with an edu-
cational prospect which commands widespread 
enthusiasm by all sectors of the community." 
After that was done, it could go to the country for 
money. 

Unfortunately for Brewster and his hope for 
rapid movement, the faculty found little it liked in 
the Dahl Report of 1972. The report had many 
worthwhile features, but two points attracted the 
attention of the faculty. The proposal for two very 
long semesters each year, which would have fit the 
normal 104 weeks of instruction a student received 
in four years into three years, was not appealing to 
those who had to teach the long terms. The pro-
posed "mentor program," designed to give stu-
dents throughout their years at Yale better ad-
vice, guidance, and evaluation of their work, 
seemed expensive and not really very innovative. 

The Dahl Report, which was intended to give 
"recommendations concerning the future of Yale 
over the next 20 years" was hailed by Brewster as 
being restrained by "an admirable modesty and a 
healthy pragmatism." The faculty, however, laid 
it aside and asked its executive committee to 
appoint an ad hoc committee to "consider the 
future of Yale University as a whole ... (and) to 
report to the faculty on possible ways in which Yale 
may achieve and maintain financial stability and 
excellence in scholarship and undergraduate and 
graduate teaching over the next generation." The 
Blum Committee, as it was called after its chair-
man, Professor John M. Blum of the history de-
partment, had some problems even beyond the 
stretch of their mandate. The major difficulty was 
in getting firm financial information. Throughout 
their deliberations it appeared that the deficit for 
the year 1971-72 would be about $4.6 million (in-
cluding contingency allowances of $1 million). In 
fact, just as they were about to report, it was re-
vealed that the deficit was only $1.2 million. 

Thus, while everyone was delighted over the im-
proved results, the committee's financial projec-
tions had to be reworked. The error, which was 
later shown to be due to numerous factors all 
working in Yale's favor, combined with a poor 
tracking system, caused a certain amount of anger 
and embarrassment. It undercut the weight of the 
administration's words. As Brewster told the Cor-
poration in September 1972, the divergence be-
tween estimates and performance posed "a danger 
that no future forecasts" would be believed "and 
that there will be continued skepticism about the 
adequacy of the information about where we stand 
financially at any given time." 

Despite the difficulties with financial infor-
mation, when it reported in December 1972, the 
Blum Committee agreed there was a very real 
financial problem. And while it pointed to various 
ways the university could, and should, save 
money, its major suggestion was a rejection of the 
Dahl Committee's extended semesters and a rec-
ommendation that Yale adopt a trimester plan 
and include a summer term which would be manda-
tory for one term for all undergraduates. It 
further suggested an increase in the size of Yale 
College to 5300 students upon the completion of 
two new residential colleges. The committee mem-
bers believed this would involve no necessary 
additions to physical plant and service facilities, 
although they confessed it would not relieve over-
crowding in the colleges. A majority of the com-
mittee did not think overcrowding was, in fact, a 
serious problem. The two undergraduate mem-
bers of the committee and one current and one 
former master disagreed, but they were outvoted 
by the others-most of whom were not closely 
involved with the colleges. The majority even 
suggested converting faculty offices in the col-
leges into residential space although that would 
have undercut a major purpose of the colleges and 
would have done nothing to solve the problem of 
overpopulation of public spaces. 

The Blum Committee was only slightly more 
successful than the Dahl Committee-perhaps 
because their report was undercut by the treas-
urer's error in estimating the deficit. The faculty 
and the Corporation did vote in January 1973 to 
move to a trimester plan for 1973-74 and the fac-
ulty appointed a committee to work on plans for a 
new pilot summer term in 1974. 

The new academic schedule-beginning 
early in September in order to make room for a 
summer term-went into effect with freshman 
registering on September 2, 1973 and the upper 
classes on September 5. The students arrived in 
the midst of the worst heat wave of the summer 
which, it must be conjectured, influenced faculty 
feelings about a summer term. The professors 
were also presented with a report of the Council of 
Masters which said that a "mandatory summer 
term will seriously injure undergraduate educa-
tion by damaging those aspects of education be-
yond the classroom which contribute to Yale's 
distinctiveness." The science faculty feared that 
the normal sequential progress of their students 
would be disrupted. Debate began at an October 
11 meeting where the faculty was surprised to 
hear President Brewster say he would support a 
voluntary summer semester rather than a manda-
tory one. If this move was based on a pragmatic 
decision that this was all he could get, it still 
undercut and embarrassed those who had suppor-
ted the mandatory term because the president had 
said it was necessary. After Brewster's state-
ment, a lively debate continued in and out of meet-
ings for two weeks. Finally, on October 25, the 
faculty voted for an experimental summer term in 
1975. They had debated too long for it to begin in 
1974. Interestingly, the new term would not do 
much to solve Yale's financial problem-the 
main reason the change had been suggested. 

Putting the best face on it he could, Brewster 
said in his annual report for the year 1973-74 that 
"The test of morale is the faculty's willingness to 
assume a degree of responsibility for helping the 
University make ends meet. This challenge has 
been met with remarkably good temper." And he 
wrote that he believed the imaginative design of

**Title: The Campaign for Yale**
**Page number(s): 12**

The Campaign for Yale 
Despite the continuing slide of the stock mar-
ket, the university unveiled its new fund drive on 
April 5, 1974. Yale was going to try to raise $370 
million over three and a half years in a "Campaign 
for Yale." This sum would be the largest amount 
of money ever sought by a university in the 
United States. Of the total amount, $239 million 
was for badly needed endowment, $55 million for 
operating expenses, and $76 million for improve-
ments. 

Comparing the new drive with the ten year 
campaign which had sought funds only from those 
who would make major gifts, it was interesting to 
see how Yale's goals had changed. In its six year 
history to June 30, 1973, the ten year plan had 
raised 39 per cent of its revised goal of $443 mil-
lion (43 per cent of endowment needs and only 21 
per cent of facilities). For current funds (not in-
cluded in the $443 million goal), the university had 
done much better- it was right on target with 
60 per cent, $43.3 million. The most notable 
change from the ten year plan to the $370 million 
campaign was in the disappearance of the Social 
Science Center- originally budgeted for $27 mil-
lion in the campaign. Gifts to that structure had 
been very hard to get. Instead, taking over Berke-
ley Divinity School in 1971 had allowed Yale to 
move its social science library to the Berkeley 
buildings and to establish a social science center 
there and in many of the beautiful old houses near-
by on Hillhouse Avenue. More alarming in its dis-
appearance from the list of Yale's needs was the 
provision of housing for graduate, law, and divin-
ity students. $6.1 million had been slated for this 
purpose in the ten year campaign. And in 1970, 
when John Hay Whitney created a $15 million 
trust for the new colleges, he made his commit-
ment with the understanding that Yale would ob-
tain similar support for an equal number of gradu-
ate students. Though the trustees voted funds for 
planning and designing new housing, that impor-
tant goal was not listed in the Campaign for Yale. 

Other changes were made, but none seemed quite 
as important as these. A substantial decline in the 
amount needed for various medical buildings was 
probably due to the fact that money for these pur-
poses could be found elsewhere. 

One reason for the timing of the announce-
ment of the new campaign was that Yale was 
finally bringing income and expenditures into 
balance. This had been achieved at the cost of 
painful contractions-"a 19 per cent reduction in 
(projected) educational budgets"-and with 
"real qualitative losses," as the president ob-
served. Though the number of professors, asso-
ciate professors, and assistant professors had in-
creased over the years, the total number of officers 
of instruction, research, and administration had 
decreased from a peak of 3,250 in November 1971 
to 2,859 in the fall of 1973. While undergraduate 
enrollment increased to 4,899 in the fall of 1973, 
graduate student enrollment had fallen from a 
peak of 2,473 in 1969 to 2,293 in 1973. The total of 
graduate and professional enrollment no longer 
surpassed the number of undergraduates after 
1970, as it had in the sixties. 

The pain of numerous budget cuts had re-
duced the deficit. In 1972-73, Brewster's tenth 
year, it was down to $896,082, the smallest 
amount since 1968-69. The total deficits and in-
tentional expenditures from capital gains for 
Brewster's ten years were $62 million. Even the 
best management would probably have faced defi-
cits in the 1970's, but a somewhat more conserv-
ative approach might well have preserved more 
endowment with which Yale could have faced the 
whipsaw of a temporary decline in gifts and raging 
inflation. 

It is interesting to note what has happened to 
the administration's eminence grise to the east. 
In 1950, Yale's total assets were about 56 per cent 
of Harvard's (at book value and probably also at 
market). By 1963, at book value, Yale's assets 
were 57 per cent of Harvard's, and were only 
about 50 per cent at market. By 1972 when Yale's 
endowment reached the highest level in history, 
the university's total assets at book were 58 per 
cent of Harvard's ($642 million to $1,119 million) 
and only 46 per cent at market ($695 million to 
$1,515 million). 

While Yale's performance in the money mar-
kets was marked as "good" in some 
areas by an observer from Dartmouth, he did note, 
according to the Yale Alumni Magazine, that over 
the last five years (1969-73) "the compound rate of 
annual return on all Yale money, including long-
term real estate holdings ... and restricted stocks 
which donors require not to be sold, has been 0.79 
per cent. By comparison, a group of 76 other uni-
versity endowment funds produced a median re-
turn of 4.38 per cent." The university's financial 
manager, Endowment Management & Research 
Corporation of Boston, had done much better with 
the funds under its care, but the total figure was 
shocking for a university administration which 
had prided itself on its "go-go" outlook.

**Title: Considerable gains**

Considerable gains 
The Brewster administration could not be 
given much praise for its financial management. 
In measured tones the Blum Committee had re-
marked that neither in "the long-term planning 
nor the short-term financial management has the 
University been as efficient or as alert as we wish 
had been possible." There were other areas of the 
university's activities, however, which deserved 
somewhat more acclaim. A high point would have 
to be Paul Mellon's gift announced in 1966, of his 
great collection of British paintings, drawings, 
books and manuscripts for a new center for British 
art and British studies. Mellon, long one of Yale's 
most generous friends, also gave a $7.4 million 
building and funds for its maintenance. While 
Louis Kahn's structure for housing the collections 
has yet to create much enthusiasm, the inclusion 
of space for commercial stores (at the insistence of 
art and architecture students and, more signifi-
cantly, the city) did mark a major commitment by 
Yale to New Haven. Unfortunately, the city re-
fused to accept this procedure in the new colleges 
and instead insisted on being able to tax the entire 
place. Wisely, Brewster rejected this demand of a 
city government which refused to view Yale's 
financial situation by any other standard than the 
size of Yale's endowment. 

Though the university's library system was 
never able to raise much of its goal under the ten 
year plan, a new Cross Campus Library was con-
structed underground at a cost (in borrowed 
funds) of $3.7 million. While many students be-
grudge the new building's sterility, they never had 
to work in the jammed Reserve Book Room in 
Sterling. In addition, the new air-conditioned 
space will be more highly valued by those who 
must work in the library in the summer. 

On the intellectual front, an achievement of 
real note was Yale's purchase in 1973, through the 
impressive efforts of Donald Gallup, of the Ezra 
Pound papers. The completion of this transaction 
(the papers arrived at Yale in 1966) made possible 
planning for the establishment of a Center for the 
study of 20th Century Literature which would 
draw upon the great resources of the Yale Collec-
tion of American Literature in Beinecke Library. 

Yale's ability to attract Charles Montgomery 
from Winterthur as Professor of the History of 
Art and Curator of the Garvan and Related Collec-
tions of American Art brought about the creation 
of an exciting display of those treasures in the new 
Mabel Brady Garvan Galleries of the Art Gallery. 
Montgomery's goal was "to create an exciting 
teaching museum." This end was achieved to crit-
ical acclaim. 

From early in his presidency, the develop-
ment of the social sciences was high on Brewster's 
agenda. The Social Science Institute and Center 
were important in this progress. The expensive 
new center has now disappeared from Yale's 
plans, as previously noted, but the institution is 
now an operating entity. While Brewster has 
vocally resisted the idea of Yale becoming a ser-
vice center, the institution is a definite move in 
that direction. It is, as the university explains, 
"an educational and research group applying 
social sciences and related professions to contem-
porary social problems in the city, in education, 
and in the management of large organizations." 
The Institute was to be made up of centers, estab-
lished for no more than ten years, which would 
continue thereafter only if there was a clear need 
for them. In a move little heralded but of enor-
mous significance, one center has already escaped 
from this position. In 1973 the Yale Corporation 
voted that on July 1, 1974 the Center for Organ-
ization and Management would become the School 
of Organization and Management absorbing the 
Department of Administrative Sciences. Thus did 
Yale finally, with little fanfare and under different 
colors, accept the business school which it had 
so long resisted. 

There were many other achievements of lesser 
note and undoubtedly many observers of the Yale 
scene will find major omissions here, but more 
important than the details of the very few new 
buildings (more in medicine than anywhere else), 
some new programs and several reorganized or 
enlarged programs (such as the School of Forestry 
becoming the School of Forestry and Environ-
