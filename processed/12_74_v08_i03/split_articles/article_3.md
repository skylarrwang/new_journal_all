control and see that it did not waste its financial 
resources. 

Thus under the president's direction, Howard 
Phelan was hired from Arthur Little & Co. to be-
come Director of Operations, new business person-
nel were employed, and major changes were made 
in the treasurer's office. The chart of accounts 
was revised and computerized, thereby increas-
ing the number of individual university accounts 
from 15,000 to 65,000 (the number has now 
reached 100,000). By 1972 the Office of Adminis-
trative Data Systems was using the computer to 
such an extent that it cost $1.2 million a year. 
These changes and others were all intended to 
reveal just what total amount was expended in 
running the university and where the money went. 
In the past, certain expenditures with offsetting 
income (largely government sponsored research) 
had been netted in the treasurer's reports; now all 
transactions were shown. Because of these new 
techniques, university expenditures which were 
shown as $57 million in 1964-65 apparently 
jumped to $79 million in 1965-66-actual expen-
ditures increased nowhere near as much. 

Another highly significant step was an at-
tempt to use the endowment more fully and freely. 
The endowment fund managers were to be allowed 
to spend not only income but a part of capital 
gains. The fund's managers would then be re-
leased from the need to invest for income and could 
purchase growth stocks providing little or no im-
mediate return. To get more knowledgeable han-
dling of the funds, the university set up its own 
investment counseling firm, owned half by the 
university and half by the firm's active managers. 

The new directors of Yale's finances (inside 
the university and out) were incredibly optimistic 
about their methods. They were convinced they 
could show everyone else how best to handle a uni-
versity's funds. The president was equally 
well. Shortly after Brewster took office he saw 
many things he wanted to do immediately. Pick-
ing up a phrase of Griswold's, he began to speak 
of Yale's "educational deficit," by which he meant 
"the best estimate of your officers and trustees 
about how much more it would cost annually to 
bring Yale to a standard of educational quality 
completely worthy of her best traditions and po-
tential.'' To begin to overcome the educational 
deficit, Brewster did not think it unwise to suffer, 
for a time, a financial deficit. The university he 
inherited was after all, more prosperous than it had 
ever been. In any case, to begin to do the things 
that needed doing, Yale immediately started prac-
ticing deficit spending. In 1963-64, the gap be-
tween income and expense amounted to $540,265 
and was projected for over a million dollars in 
1964-65. As Brewster explained, these deficits 
reflected "a deliberate corporate judgment that 
Yale will be stronger in the long run if we make 
certain operating improvements now, even though 
it may diminish slightly our pool of unrestricted 
capital for the future." 

Thus it was that during what were later called 
"the bonanza years" Yale's expenditures went 
from a "new" accounting $79 million in 1965-66 
to $125 million in 1969-70. At the same time, the 
university suffered a deficit every single year 
(though university officials never mention a defi-
cit prior to 1966-67). In 1966-67, when there was a 
deficit of $300,000,-the smallest deficit between 
1963-64 and 1972-73-the treasurer wrote, "An 
Operating Surplus evidences lack of achievement 
rather than good management if educational qual-
ity can be improved." And the following year a 
$600,000 deficit was dismissed as "not itself a 
matter for sharp concern." 

In fact, it should have been a matter of the 
very deepest concern, for Yale had failed to recall 
the parable of the seven fat years and the seven 
lean years. The university's period of prosperity 
was rapidly coming to a close. The stock market 
began to fall, tax reform proposals dangerous to 
colleges dependent on charity were in the air, gov-
ernment policies were about to change, inflation 
was increasing rapidly, and the alumni were be-
coming constantly more discontented over certain 
Yale policies. 

Not until 1968-69 did the treasurer begin to 
recognize that Yale's deficits were not due only to 
rising expenses or minor accounting errors, but to 
"short-falls in estimates of income, attributable in 
some measure to over-optimism." Increasingly 
large deficits were predicted for the years imme-
diately ahead. Cut-backs began to be made in 
numerous areas. "Significant" reductions in 
"activities both academic and administrative" 
were predicted. Due to over-optimism the uni-
versity now faced the future with the deepest 
gloom. 

From optimism to alarm


Yale's problems were not hers alone (many 
other private universities were in even worse 
shape), but some of the reasons were peculiar to 
Yale. As far as the general situation was con-
cerned, for years Griswold and others had warned 
that the universities were not making their true 
costs clear to the public. Furthermore, they noted 
that the people called for education but were not 
willing to pay the real price for it. The temper of 
alarm in academic circles dropped off somewhat 
during the prosperous days of the late fifties and 
sixties, only to rise again late in the decade. In 
June 1967 Time magazine noted that "Behind the 
impressive facades of most private universities 
and colleges there is a deep concern. They are in 
grave financial trouble." While his treasurer was 
still talking optimistically in his reports, Brewster 
was quoted as saying that Yale "has never had a 
more difficult financial prospect." The university 
was said to be facing "an annual operating deficit 
of more than $15 million by 1977." Many others 
thought in one way or another that the private 
universities were facing "imminent bankruptcy." 

Yale's administration had seen the need for 
aggressive fund-raising very early. In November 
1964 the university revealed that it wanted consi-
derably more than $100 million in capital funds, 
without even including necessary programs for 
the Divinity, Drama, and Music Schools. Areas of 
importance were additional library space, a build-
ing for engineering and applied sciences, and 
massive expenditures for the Medical School. 
Very high on the list of priorities at this time was 
a great new social science building. As Brewster 
viewed the "strategy" of the university-a favor-
ite approach of the president's-he thought he 
saw a great breakthrough coming in the social 
and behavioral sciences. Yale must develop those 
areas, he believed, if it were not to be left behind 
as it had been in the scientific explosion of the 
1920's and 1930's. 

The 1964 needs were merely a preliminary 
estimate. As Yale's new managers ("technocrats 
of the educational world," Professor Paul Weis 
called them) studied the university's needs over 
the next ten years, the figures grew and grew. By 
1967 they had decided that Yale must raise nearly 
a billion dollars from all sources over the next ten 
years. Of this amount the alumni fund would have 
to come up with nearly $45 million, and gifts from 
private sources for endowment and facilities must

reach $388 million (later raised to $443 million 
after Yale College became coeducational). This 
great sum, Brewster announced, was "The Cost 
of Quality." 

Yale intended to raise the needed funds not 
by "primary" reliance on a crash campaign 
(though not announced, one was planned to begin 
about 1970), but by seeking out "the several hun-
dred members of each generation whose assets 
would allow them to be philanthropists of 
capital significance." If these men would remem-
ber Yale's "significance to them and believe in 
her significance to the nation," the university 
would achieve its enormous goal. 

There was, however, one sizeable difficulty 
standing between Yale and the great achieve-
ments her imaginative, creative, and courageous 
managers foresaw. The university was losing the 
support of a significant part of the Yale 
College alumni. 

A sizeable neglect


Every Yale president has to deal with various 
constituencies-the students, the faculty, the 
alumni, the city of New Haven, the state, the 
federal government, the public at large. The 
interests of these groups (as well as their capacity, 
or desire, for trouble-making) are often dissimilar, 
and balancing their demands is a difficult politi-
cal feat. At first, Brewster appears to have been 
most interested in the concerns of faculty and 
students-towards the end of the sixties, the stu-
dents were to overshadow everyone else. The 
president began by showing a somewhat arrogant 
disregard for the concerns of the alumni of Yale 
College and often seemed to take their support for 
granted. Public relations, when practiced at all, 
consisted of "splashy" appointments which would 
make headlines in the New York Times. Still, 
Yale might have kept the support of its graduates 
had not other factors combined to alienate them 
and to confirm their distrust of the president. 

Admissions procedures, as they had earlier in 
the century, became a point of sizeable controver-
sy. Brewster had inherited from Griswold's era a 
powerful and persuasive program for the future of 
Yale College in the Freshman Year Report of 1962. 
In addition to calling for coeducation, one of its 
key recommendations had been for the admission 
of a much more intellectually oriented student 
body. President Brewster appears to have accept-
ed most of the recommendations of the report-
indeed, it became nearly a blueprint for his 
approach to the College. In his first appearance 
before a Yale club, he announced that academic 
excellence was Yale's primary business and there-
fore it must seek out those with the highest 
intellectual and moral capacities. This message 
could not have been a popular one with many 
"Old Blues," for Yale's alumni, as a little research 
would have shown the president, have always 
valued character over intellect. 

Nevertheless, Brewster plunged ahead. With 
his goal of a more scholarly student body 
linked with a policy (voted in May 1963) of 
financial aid for anyone who needed it, there soon 
occurred a striking change in the student body. In 
1960, 26 per cent of the class admitted were 
alumni sons. Seven years later only 14 per cent 
of the class admitted were the sons of alumni. 
Throughout the 1950's, students from private 
schools made up over 50 per cent of every class. 
By 1967 this group had dropped to 38 per cent. 
Another major change, produced by the civil 
rights movement, was the addition of blacks. In 
the class of 1962, just three had been admitted; 
the class of 1973 contained 96 black men and 
women. Many graduates tended to view Yale as 
"their" college and were outraged over these 
changes. Perhaps the bitter pill might have been 
made more palatable if it had been offered to them 
more slowly, with some skill, and a certain amount 
of sugar coating. Instead, the university's 
young Dean of Admissions, R. Inslee Clark 
(B.A. 1957), tended to make what some felt were 
ill-considered statements, which infuriated alumni 
and private school administrators alike. At the 
same time, Yale seemed to make a conscious effort 
to conceal the fact that alumni sons still had a 
better chance of being accepted in the college than 
their less favored schoolmates. 

By October 1966 the annoyance of Yale grad-
uates was so obvious that Brewster was forced to 
defend the admissions procedures in the 
Yale Alumni Magazine and the Alumni Board felt 
called upon to investigate the whole question. 
Unfortunately, the board's report, which appeared 
in 1967, did nothing to dispel alumni anger. 
The chairman of the committee concluded, "it 
appears that Yale's administration is providing 
the leadership, foresight and facilities to handle 
today's problems and enable Yale to maintain its 
tradition of excellence." Few alumni believed him. 

The alumni, in fact, may no longer have been 
capable of being persuaded. Too much more was 
happening that disturbed them. 

Women, radicals, and ROTC


Part of the problem undoubtedly was due to a 
series of things done by Yale and men at Yale of 
which the largely conservative alumni disap-
proved. First, the University Chaplain, William 
Sloane Coffin, made newspaper headlines as a 
peripatetic warrior in the civil rights confronta-
tions of the early 1960's. Then, Martin Luther 
King was given an honorary degree in 1964. 
After that, the divisive war in Vietnam began to 
cause problems at Yale, just as it did in the coun-
try at large. Here again, Coffin was in the front 
rank, but this time he shared the limelight with an 
attractive young assistant professor of history, 
Staughton Lynd. An outspoken proponent of the 
New Left, Lynd was already a subject of 
controversy when he took a trip to Hanoi with 
Herbert Aptheker and Thomas Hayden over 
Christmas 1965 to attempt to clarify North 
Vietnam's peace terms. Brewster reacted by 
pushing the powers of his office as far-per-
haps even farther-than he legitimately could: 
he called Lynd to his office to try to discover if the 
young teacher was sincere in his opinions. 

This action scarcely satisfied many Yale alumni. 
Forgetting the fact that the university had a 
greater responsibility to protect the rights of free-
dom of speech and action than a business 
corporation, they called for Yale to fire Coffin and 
Lynd. 

As the war in Vietnam dragged on and created 
ever-deepening divisions between Americans, so it 
also increasingly divided the university from its 
graduates. When Coffin was indicted in 
January 1968 (along with Benjamin Spock [B.A. 
1925] and others) for conspiring to persuade 
young men to give up their draft cards, and then 
was reappointed University Chaplain while still 
under indictment, many graduates felt that their 
worst fears about Yale had been justified. That 
Lynd was not reappointed by the history depart-
ment, that same year, received no acclaim. 

As if all these problems were not enough, 
Yale announced in the fall of 1968 that it would 
admit 500 women as undergraduates the next 
year. To some alumni this action marked the end 
of old Yale. 

The story of Yale's move to coeducation is 
long and complex, but the major points worth 
noting are that after the Freshman Year 
Report of 1962 recommended the admission of 
women, little was done until the spring of 1966. 
Then, President Brewster announced that the 
corporation had laid down certain guidelines 
which were to control future deliberations on the 
subject: the corporation did not favor admit-
ting women if it meant reducing the number of 
male undergraduates; the admission of women 
must be underwritten by sufficient funds to 
maintain the quality of the university; and, if 
studies indicated the desirability of coeducation, 
the corporation preferred it to be achieved by 
means of a coordinated woman's college, rather 
than by the expansion of Yale College. 

(Strangely, Brewster's 1972 memorandum on co-
education says the corporation never discussed 
the matter until 1967). 

In December 1966 it was revealed that Yale 
had invited Vassar to study the possibility of 
moving to New Haven. But the migration was 
not to be. In the face of large-scale alumnae 
opposition, Vassar decided on November 20, 1967 
to remain in Poughkeepsie. Brewster, though ex-
pressing disappointment, said that the studies 
with Vassar had at least clarified Yale's think-
ing about the problem and given some specific 
idea of the cost. One thing was certain, he de-
clared, and it was that coeducation would come to 
Yale in the form of a coordinate college which 
would allow Yale to "educate women not as a 
direct by-product of educating men." 

One year later the impatient Yale students


--- Page 6 ---

decided to try a bit of coeducation on their own. 
They held a coeducation week from November 4 to 
November 11, 1968. On November 6, Brewster 
told them, "by 1972 ... there will be women at 
Yale." Three days later, the president received a 
petition from 1700 students and visiting coeds 
requesting: 

1) equal admission for men and women for 
the class of 1973; 2) a limited number of 
transfer students to be added to the classes 
of 1970, 1971, and 1972; and 3) active re-
cruitment of female faculty with equal oppor-
tunity for advancement. 

On that very day, November 9, 1968, though 
the students did not know it, the Corporation 
voted to admit women to Yale College. On 
November 14, the college faculty gave their ap-
proval. Five hundred women, it was announced, 
would be admitted in the fall of 1969 on an experi-
mental basis. The extra cost to Yale would be met 
by tuition and fee charges. It appears, from 
various later explanations of President Brewster, 
that as late as October 1968 he still believed in a 
coordinate college approach, but the Corporation 
wanted to be sure whatever was done could be 
easily converted to total coeducation. "As a result 
of this Corporation meeting and ensuing discus-
sions with colleagues," Brewster wrote, he shifted 
from the coordinate approach to full coeducation. 
He was convinced, it appears, by the experience of 
Radcliffe, Pembroke, and the Princeton study of 
coeducation. To the Princeton Study, Brewster 
said, "we owe a great debt." It seems possible 
that Brewster feared Princeton might somehow 
get ahead of Yale. 

In any case, the die was cast. Nearly every 
guideline the Corporation had laid down three 
years before had been broken. Without money, 
without buildings, without, indeed, much specific 
planning (it was not even known where the women 
would live), President Brewster, the Yale Corpora-
tion, the college faculty, and the students plunged 
eagerly into the unknowns of coeducation. When 
within a short time the problems of overcrowding, 
quotas, and "male chauvinism" began to appear, 
many people wondered if Yale might not have 
moved with a bit more forethought. 

Hardly had the Yale alumni had time to ad-
just to the stunning news of coeducation than 
they were greeted by another startling piece of in-
formation. On January 30, 1969 the Yale College 
faculty voted 116 to 28 to remove the academic 
status of Army and Navy R.O.T.C. and make 
them extracurricular activities. The programs 
had always lacked intellectual rigor (General 
Westmoreland said, "Hell, we don't even give 
academic credit for military courses at West 
Point"), but the faculty's action in the midst of 
the Vietnam war turned a long needed curricu-
lar revision into a political act. Many alumni were 
outraged: "Whatever has happened to 'For 
God, for Country, and for Yale'?" was a constant 
theme of their letters to the alumni magazine. 

All of these shocks to Yale's alumni were 
taking place, of course, at the same time that a 
change in generations was bringing students with 
different dress, different hair, different life styles, 
and different outlooks to the college. The new 
undergraduates were part of a generation 
which had known little but peace and prosperity 
until the United States became involved in Viet-
nam. Hence their perspective tended to be 
incredibly different from that of alumni who had 
lived through world wars and depression. These 
new students not only looked and thought differ-
ently, but to the horror of the alumni they 
smoked marijuana, used LSD, and who knew 
what other forms of mind distorting substances. 
With Yale's changed admission procedures it 
became easy for alumni to place the blame for 
what was plainly a generational question on 
Kingman Brewster. 

All the bitter discontent that had been build-
ing up in many a Yale alumnus was expressed 
in December 1969 by Julien Dedman (B.A. 1948) 
in a pamphlet entitled The Rape of Yale. 
Dedman fulminated at length about the students, 
especially their slovenly appearance and "the aro-
ma of 'pot'" on campus. He blamed it all on 
Brewster's appointment of R. Inslee Clark. 
Dedman also cried out against the university's 
"radicalism," which could be seen in the presence 
of Coffin and Lynd, the "defense" of draft 
dodgers (they were to be readmitted on the same 
terms as those who withdrew for military service), 
the anti-war stand of many of Yale's faculty, the 
activities of the Drama School (especially the 
appearance there of the Living Theater), the 
"rude reception" Ronald Reagan had received at 
Yale, the banning of George Wallace as a 
speaker (at the time of a New Haven city elec-
tion), the removal of academic credit for R.O.T.C., 
and the arrogant emasculation of Yale by the ad-
mission of women "without any consultation 
with the alumni groups on whom Yale depends for 
financial support." Yale, Dedman concluded, had 
been betrayed "under the guise of a misguided 
liberalism." 

Certainly to the Dedmans among the Yale 
alumni no change at Yale would have been 
welcome. Many other less alienated alumni 
criticized Yale because of a basic lack of under-
standing of a university and its functions. 

But Brewster, on the other hand, does not seem to 
have been sufficiently attuned to alumni feeling. 
Even if many of the graduates were wrong or 
misguided or simply out of touch, he and his aides 
should have realized that the "credibility gap" 
they knew had developed was in fact based on a 
real lack of honest, straightforward communica-
tion. Brewster might have done well to study 
some advice of Griswold's. The president has a 
duty not only to raise money, he had said, but 
an even greater responsibility to educate the pa-
trons of the university in its purposes: 

"The reason some institutions have forged ahead 
of others is that they have been more enterprising 
and more successful in this mission." This 
responsibility Brewster had failed to accomplish. 

The inability or unwillingness to educate the 
alumni, and their increasing restiveness, may not 
have seemed very worrisome at first. The uni-
versity's fund-raising strategy was directed to a 
few large donors. As long as they could be 
convinced, all seemed well. But then in 1970 
the treasurer reported that a major cause of 
Yale's deficit that year was a "shortfall" in the 
alumni fund. This failure he put down to "over-
optimism about what the war classes of 1945-
1945W could do in spite of the lack of a normal 
college life." Since the alumni fund, like 
every part of the university's income, had been 
projected by the university's optimistic managers 
to grow at a certain set rate (about 9 per cent) 
every year, and future budgets were planned on 
the basis of that growth, the failure was an 
ominous one. It was especially so because, 
Treasurer John Ecklund said, "the prospect of the 
shortfall did not become known until late in May, 
1970, therefore the same problem carried forward 
to the budget for 1970-71." 

The last sentence was a revealing one. For 
April and May 1970 had produced one of the more 
traumatic experiences in Yale's long history. It 
seems likely that the events surrounding May 
Day 1970 in New Haven, when combined with an 
already very high level of discontent, had a 
great deal more to do with the alumni fund's 
failure than the lack of a normal college life 
for the members of the classes of 1945 and 1945W. 

May Day 1970


The "strike" of late April and early May 
1970 appears to have been the swan song for the 
Yale student generation of the 1960's. It 
occurred against a background of rising student 
activism at the university. Though Yale had 
remained comparatively peaceful throughout the 
period of increasing violence at the universities 
which began in 1964-avoiding the crises which 
struck most noticeably at Berkeley, Columbia, 
Cornell, San Francisco State, Chicago, and 
Harvard-it had had its moments of excitement 
tinged with fear. The spring of 1969 had seen the 
first critical period when there had been cries for 
changes in Yale University governance (especially 
to give the students a greater voice) and, much 
more forcefully, a call for the complete ejection of 
the reserve officers training programs from the 
campus. This last demand had reached its peak at 
a mass meeting of the university where a resolu-
tion to deny the military programs any place at 
Yale ended in a staggering 1286-1286 tie vote. 

As the Yale Alumni Magazine observed, "It 
was as if a giant balloon had been popped." 

The months of May and June 1969 were also 
marked by demonstrations at the Art and Archi-
tecture School over inadequate financial aid to 
students, what students felt was a lack of 
consultation over the selection of a chairman for 
the art department, and finally, the crisis in the
