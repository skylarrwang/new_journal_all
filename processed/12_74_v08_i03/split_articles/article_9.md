EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
IF YOU DON'T MAKE IT INTO THE 
BANNER 
DIRECTORY OF ORGANIZATIONS, 
YOU JUST DON'T MAKE IT. 
The 1975 Yale Banner yearbook will include a Directory of Organizations, complete with full 
descriptions of the group's activities, full membership rosters, and a photograph of the group. 
Whether you're in MEChA, BSAY, or YUWO, The Revue, New Journal, or Daily, the Dramat, the 
Symphony, or the Baker's Dozen, Dwight Hall, U.S. Grant Foundation, or Alpha Phi, the Prom 
Committee, Tang Team, or JCSC, there is a place for you in the Banner. 
Any Yale College or residential college organization providing enlightenment, entertainment or 
service to others is eligible for inclusion. 
What's the catch? The organizations must provide all the material: a description (maximum 150 
words), the list of officers and members, and the optional group portrait. 
Too much effort? It should take very little time, and it will secure for you and your organization a 
handsome niche in Yale College's only permanent record. 
Call us at 68650 for more information, or bring your statement and roster to the Yale Banner, 
under the Woolsey Dome. 
DEADLINE WEDNESDAY 15 JANUARY
