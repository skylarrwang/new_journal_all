Brewster pointed with pride in 1973 to an
improved faculty: "Perhaps the least heralded
change at Yale was the raising of standards for
senior faculty ranks in the early sixties." This had
been accomplished by building on steps taken
while he was provost under Whitney Griswold.
These first moves were now expanded and system-
atized so that while nominations for tenure ap-
pointments still originated with departments,
they were now reviewed by divisional committees
for the fields of humanities, sciences, and social
sciences. This judgment by "a jury of peers out-
side the department," according to Brewster,
resulted in much better standards: "Softness was
squeezed out. A Yale professorship means more
today than it did ten years ago." During these
years members of the Yale faculty, for the first
time, won Nobel prizes. One went to Lars On-
sager, a Yale Ph.D. and, fittingly, J. Willard
Gibbs Professor of Theoretical Chemistry, and
another went to George Emil Palade, a new mem-
ber of the Medical School.


Judgment of a university is a notably slip-
pery thing. In a poll in 1964, the Yale graduate
school was either third in the nation, or eighth, if
engineering was included. By 1969, a similar poll
indicated that even including engineering, the
school had moved to fifth. In the 1969 report, it
was shown that Yale had improved more than any
other university, for fifteen of its departments re-
ceived higher ratings in 1969 than in 1964. Yale
ranked first in the country in English, French,
history, political science, and pharmacology. A
poll of professional school deans was not so kind
to Yale, but it, of course, was dismissed as being
badly conducted (which it probably was). Even
so, it did give the Yale Divinity School top rank in
its field, placed Yale second in law, behind Har-
vard, and put the Medical School in a three-way
tie for third place. It did seem clear, as well, that
excellent appointments had been made in many
areas, the sciences had definitely improved, and
Yale's traditional great strength in the humanities
had been retained- perhaps even increased. One
recognition of Yale's position in this list area was
receipt of $2.75 million from the National Endow-
ment for the Humanities to fund for four years the
first National Institute for the Humanities to
work toward a new approach to teaching subjects
in this area.


Looking back and beyond

As Brewster began his second decade as pres-
ident of Yale one of the most striking changes was
in the tone of the student body. While no change
in admissions procedure could yet have caused the
result, all through the university there was a
quietness and seriousness that was hard to believe
after the boisterous, often pugnacious, late sixties.
By the fall of 1971, use of the Cross Campus
Library was up 66 per cent over the previous year.
And one of the few protests of the year occurred
when the library, in a budget cutting move, tried
to reduce its hours. Still, the students had not
completely given up concern for other things-
especially as long as the Vietnam War continued
or escalated as it did in the spring of 1972. In one
case, during April 1972, General William West-
moreland cancelled a speech at Yale to avoid
angry and noisy demonstrators in the Law School
auditorium. University administrators had done
little to see that the speech would not be disrup-
ted. Westmoreland had already prepared a letter
of withdrawal and had refused the advice of Sec-
retary of the University "Sam" Chauncey to go
ahead and speak. Brewster used these incidents
as excuses to make a self-serving statement about
Yale's "determination to risk whatever confronta-
tion might have occurred to vindicate the Political
Union's right to listen to speakers of their choice
without interruption." Two years later, when
William Shockley tried to put forth his ideas on the
genetic inferiority of blacks in a debate on the
necessity for society "to diagnose and treat" (by
which Shockley meant "voluntary sterilization"),
he was prevented from doing so by the noisy
disapproval of many students. Again, the univer-
sity administration's defense of the right of free
speech was weak and uncertain.


The escalation of the war in Vietnam in 1972
brought calls for a new strike, but 65-80 per cent
of the students continued to attend classes. Some
students got themselves arrested for various
forms of disruptive behavior, but most were not
involved. A strange mixture of individuals from
town and gown traveled to Washington to lobby
with their representatives against the war. Some
later got themselves arrested in the rotunda of the
Capitol. But this was not the revival of the old
era. More characteristic was the constant and
ever increasing talk of "grim professionalism" in
the college. The year 1972-73 was described by
one student as "the year of the weenie,"-the
grind. More and more students were choosing
professional schools as their goal beyond Yale,
and an increasing number of them felt it necessary
to work much harder than before. Chemistry labs
were overcrowded by pre-medical students and the
chemistry department was worried about becom-
ing nothing but a training ground for future doc-
tors.


One aspect of the tone of the college may have
been the overcrowding. While the university
administration, the Blum Committee, and others
continued to deny the situation, to those who
experienced it there was no doubt of its existence.
While Dean of Undergraduate Affairs John Wil-
kinson (B.A. 1960) said the situation was worse
in 1945-62 before Morse and Stiles Colleges were
opened, apparently he was only counting students
per room and ignored the fact that many more
students now lived off campus. On a measure of
one body per room, the colleges were at 101 per
cent of capacity in the fall of 1973 with 600 living
off campus. The crowding of public spaces-
common rooms, libraries, and dining halls-was
especially noticeable. The quality of Yale residen-
tial college life was definitely deteriorating and a
resource which had probably been very helpful in
keeping Yale a liveable community and reducing
outbreaks in the sixties was clearly being under-
cut. The Yale Daily News complained of "cattle-
car accomodations." George W. Pierson, the
University Historian, undoubtedly spoke for
many when he said in 1973, "I don't eat lunch at
Davenport anymore, I find it too unpleasant. It's
disorderly, overcrowded, overnoisy. Yale has be-
come a very impersonal place compared to what it
used to be."


Another measure of the flavor of Yale was a
return to some of the silliness of earlier days.
Though fraternities continued to close because of
financial problems (only Fence remained in the fall
of 1974), "streaking" naked through the streets
page 13
and within the campus made its appearance in the
spring of 1974. Drunkenness became a problem
once again. And in better sign, the traditional
clay pipes, banished by the puritans of '69, return-
ed to class day in 1974.


As Yale approached its 275th year it appear-
ed to be in a state of "normalcy": the financial
situation was serious as usual; students were com-
plaining about the quality of life; and the univer-
sity, despite all, remained a dynamic place of
world significance. What it would be like decades
later on its 300th anniversary was another ques-
tion. Certainly, the actions of the president, who-
ever he might then be, would make a substantial
difference.


As Brewster entered his second decade as
president of Yale, he was speaking more openly of
the day he would resign, and university sooth-
sayers were studying their crystal balls for a suc-
cessor. One rumor had it that Brewster would
leave his post when those who liked him had con-
tributed to the Campaign for Yale, so his succes-
sor could then collect from his enemies. Whatever
the length of the remainder of his presidency, it
was still too soon to figure a "final mark" for his
leadership. It seemed clear that in dealing with
the fractious students of the 1960's, Brewster's
pragmatism and flexibility had been a positive
plus to him and the institution. The alienation of
the alumni, given the problems of the years of
student protest, may have been unavoidable, but
Brewster's handling of the admissions procedure
had only served to irritate the graduates further.
The president's financial policies still could not be
judged. While the performance to 1974 was far
from successful, the new devices and arrange-
ments might ultimately prove themselves. De-
spite the financial stringency of the seventies and
the disgraceful level of assistant professors' sal-
aries, the overall faculty was larger, better paid,
and probably stronger (though weaknesses cer-
tainly remained) than when he began. The admin-
istrative organization of the university had been
improved and modernized, but again it was some-
what too early to tell how successful these changes
had been.


Today one senses a certain fatigue about the
whole administration, but that may only be the
damper that financial stringency places on every-
one. The throbbing vitality of the entire institu-
tion which one felt only a few years ago, seems to
have lessened. If fear of the ultimate disruption
by the students has disappeared-for which
everyone must be thankful-so has some of the
vigor their commitment and activity brought to
life at Yale. This particular flavor Brewster
neither brought nor took away. This survey of the
Brewster years must end with neither the fanfare
of trumpets nor a dirge-only uncertainty. The
financial situation remains sufficiently gloomy
that one must wonder with the president if some
day Yale may "cease to exist in recognizable
form as a free, internationally significant insti-
tution."
