sociate pastor, had any knowledge of
the city from outside a Yale con-
text-but Brewster rarely took coun-
cil with them. Others, like Director
Barnes, who had been a CIA agent
before returning to Yale, were un-
familiar with the city's particular
problems. Outside the Council,
Brewster relied heavily on Old Blue
advisors such as Al Fitt, who had
been an Undersecretary of Defense,
and Cyrus Vance. These men, while
skilled in international affairs, lacked
an understanding of the personal-
ities and problems of a blue-collar
community.


The Council failed to develop a co-
herent strategy for university-city
relations. It first tried to fund com-
munity groups. Yale gave $100,000
to the New Haven Black Coalition
for use in various community pro-
grams. But other groups pressured
the university for funds it could not
provide. Tension arose as New Ha-
ven's other ethnic organizations re-
garded the grant as favoritism
toward the Coalition. Yale discontin-
ued these grants.


The Council fared no better devis-
ing a strategy to govern the universi-
ty's physical expansion- the most
visible of its problems with the city.
When Yale announced plans to build
the Mellon Center (now the Center
for British Art and British Studies)
on Chapel Street, it met strong op-
position from the city, which was
nervously eyeing its shrinking
Grand List (the list of all taxable
land in the city). Though a compro-
mise was worked out- Yale
would allow retail stores on the
ground floor of the Center- universi-
ty officials failed to use the situation
to begin communications with the
city on the general problem of tax-
exempt land in New Haven. The inci-
dent simply represented another case
of Yale dealing with the city only af-
ter a specific project had offended
the community and its leaders.


Finally, the Council showed short-
sightedness in its technical assis-
tance to New Haven. It failed to plan
a way to implement Brewster's pro-
mise "to make it easier for faculty,
staff and students to contribute their
own time, talent and energies as vol-
unteers, consultants or even salaried
workers on city problems." More im-
portant, the Council failed to stop
the university from cutting out
worthwhile programs that were help-
ing New Haven: the Summer High
School, ISSP, and the Masters of
Arts and Teaching program all dis-
appeared. No programs took their
place.


While Yale never constructed a
policy to guide its attitude toward
New Haven, many New Havenites
felt that the city should devise one
toward Yale. Bartholemew Guida,
President of the Board of Aldermen
in 1968, was obviously one such New
Havenite. He authored the Institu-
tional Development Ordinance- the
so-called "Guida-Amendment" -de-
claring that no land could be re-
moved from New Haven's tax rolls
without prior aldermanic approval.
In 1969, Bartholemew Guida was
elected Mayor of New Haven.


Unlike his predecessor, Guida was
not impressed with grandiose plans
and flashy appointments. The son of
Italian immigrants, Guida had no in-
timate Yale connections and brought
to the office of mayor the more tradi-
tional concerns of the New Haven
community. He also had new prob-
lems facing him. Lee had heavily fi-
nanced his renewal program with
federal funds, and when (under the
Nixon Administration) those funds
dried-up, New Haven's financial situ-
ation grew steadily worse. Guida felt
that Yale, as a citizen of the com-
munity, had an obligation to help
New Haven financially- as Harvard,
MIT, Dartmouth, and Princeton had
long done in their own communities.


Yale officials apparently did not
realize that there had been a change
of style in City Hall. Yale's attemp-
ted fait accompli with the design of
the two residential colleges might
have gone over well with Lee (who
had quite a flair for the fait accompli
himself), but it reportedly annoyed
Guida. Perhaps Brewster and other
officials felt that because they had
applied the "Mellon formula" to the
colleges there was no need to consult
the city further. The city disagreed.
United by what they saw as another
example of Yale's arrogance, the Al-
dermen twice rejected the university
proposal. Many people at Yale con-
sidered New Haven's actions tanta-
mount to blackmail, but the city
seems to have been simply and force-
fully saying that it was time, per-
haps long past time, for Yale to sit
down with the city to discuss the fu-
ture. The city was even willing to
sacrifice the economic benefits at-
tached to building the colleges in or-
der to gain a more permanent settle-
ment with Yale.


It is only since the colleges have
been turned down that Brewster and
the Yale Administration have made
a serious effort to deal with New Ha-
ven. Interestingly enough, Brewster
almost repeated a past mistake when
he first considered a Philadelphia
man for Yale's liason with the city.
In the end, however, he appointed
Henry "Sam" Chauncey to the po-
sition- one of the most positive de-
cisions he has made to further Yale-
New Haven relations.


Chauncey is clearly a Yale man;
but he has shown an ability to see be-
yond the one-sided approach and


view town-gown problems realistic-
ally. Since taking on the job, he has
made progress in coordinating the
various functions of Yale which af-
fect the city. Several activities, in-
cluding the Office of Community Af-
fairs Development, the Council's suc-
cessor, and Yale Volunteer Services
now fall under Chauncey's auspices.
In addition, Chauncey has been able
to discuss hard issues with city of-
ficials-something previous Yale of-
ficials could not or would not do.
Chauncey dexterously handled the
New York Giants negotiations for
the university which has resulted in
a profitable deal for both Yale and
the city.


But Chauncey, too, has been short-
sighted at times. In his article in the
December 1973 issue of the
Yale Alumni Magazine entitled,
"What Are We Doing Wrong?What
Can We Do Better?" Chauncey dwelt
too long on cosmetic problems.
While students crossing against the
light at College and Grove Streets
and the "frightening entrance" to
the Yale Art Gallery may be annoy-
ances to New Havenites, larger prob-
lems exist to which Chauncey should
devote more time-such as the Med-
ical School's lack of involvement
with the health problems of the Hill
neighborhood. He claims that the
university has not made itself "un-
derstandable to the official city peo-
ple"; the fact may be, however, that
the city people understand Yale all
too well.


Chauncey does recognize that Yale
has been too cavalier with New Ha-
ven. He noted in his article that the
problem with the colleges was not
simply over the tax question, but al-
so involved historic antagonisms,
and Yale's over-optimism about hav-
ing its way.


For the future, Chauncey has as-
sembled a staff to deal with the
town-gown problem. They have di-
vided their task into five key areas:
educational and cultural, physical
plant, economic and financial, medi-
cal care, and volunteer. Within these
divisions, Chauncey hopes to care-
fully investigate everything
from how Yale could make its facili-
ties more available, to how Yale's
considerable investment real estate
holdings affect New Haven's neigh-
borhoods.


Chauncey's efforts are at least a
first step. The question remains
when and if he will present a co-
herent and workable plan to the Cor-
poration and how the Corporation
will treat such a plan. If Yale main-
tains the view that its "mission"
cannot allow it to actively work with
New Haven, the university may find
that it is jeopardizing its own goals
in the process.
