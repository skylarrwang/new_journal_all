A history of Kingman Brewster's Yale 
Corporation Room underlines anum· 
ber of themes in the recent history 
of Yale-New Haven relations. Most 
important has been the lack of con-
tinuous dialogue between the univer· 
sity and the city engendered by what 
has been, until quite recently, Yale's 
insensitivity to New Haven's needs. 

Among the things Kingman Brew-
ster inherited from President A. 
Whitney Griswold was a cordial 
relationship with then Mayor of New 
Haven, Richard C. Lee. It was a val· 
uable relationship. During the 1950's 
and early 1960's, Yale benifited more 
from Lee's nationally heralded urban 
renewal program than did most New 
Havenites. Lee's first project, the 
Oak Street slum clearance, paved the 
way for the expansion of the Yale 
Medical School. In 1955, Yale paid 
New Haven well above the market 
price to have the Hillhouse and 
Boardman Commercial High Schools 
removed from the spot where Stiles 
and Morse Colleges now stand. 

Lee accomplished his renewal pro· 
gram by creating a parallel govern· 
ment of appointed bureaucrats, thus 
short-circuiting any input from the 
city's traditional power bases (the 
Democratic Party machine), and the 
community. Consequently, neither 
Griswold nor Brewster, who became 
president in 1963, had to deal with 
those groups either. They simply 
worked with Lee or his bureaucrats. 

The fast-paced, feaerally funded 
days of urban renewal also allowed 
the university to ~porarily push 
aside what had always been a divi· 
sive issue between Yale and New 
Haven: the issue of taxation. 

In 1967, the black neighborhoods 
Lee had neglected for so long rioted. 
Although riots occurred nationally 
that summer, two-issues were unique 
to New Haven. The black leaders 
demanded a larger say in Lee's 
program, and insisted that Yale do 
something for the people of ~ ew 
Haven, whom, the leaders said, the 
university had totally neglected. The 
latter claim was not entirely true. 
Since 1965 Yale had sponsored such 
programs as the U.S. Grant Founda-
tion, theY ale Summer High School, 
and the Intensive Summer Studies 
Program (ISSP)-all helping disad· 
vantaged youths. These programs, 
however, reflected actions by indi· 
viduals within theY ale community .. 
rather than official university policy. 

In 1968, Yale had plans for further 
physical expansion, but still no co-
ordinated policy for dealing with 
New Haven's needs. 

In response to community pres· 
sure in New Haven and to growing 
urban problems in the nation at 
large, President Brewster acknow-
ledged in 1968 that Yale did have an 
obligation to its urban community. 
Nevertheless, he put limits on where 
that obligation could lead Yale. Sinee 
becoming president, Brewster had 
stressed that Yale's "mission" in the 
world was to be a sanctuary for 
scholars and students. In the late 
1960's, Brewster felt Yale's "mission" 
challenged by a soCiety which wished 
to use universities to solve social 
problems. Brewster feared, as bad 
Griswold, that Yale would become a 
"service station" for needy com· 
munity groups. Yale could never 
help all those groups, Brewster as· 
serted, and so he felt Yale should 
take on only those tasks that would 
not divert it from its central purpose. 
"We are, in short," Brewster wrote 
in 1968, "best equipped to be our 
brother's thinker." Through scholar-
ly enterprises like the proposed Insti· 
tution for Social and Policy Studies, 
Brewster felt Yale would pioneer in 
devising theories to solve the 
national problem of urban blight. Aft, 
a theory, Brewster's idea was per· 
haps noble. But for a university 
which owned 36 per cent of the tax 
exempt land, was the city'slargest 
employer, and whose students were 
rapidly devouring the city's housing, 
the concept of being "our brother's 
thinker" was entirely inadequate. 

Brewster sought to implement his 
ideas about Yale and New Haven by 
establishing in 1968 the Council on 
Community Affairs. Directed by C. 
Tracy Barnes ('33), the 12-man coun· 
cil was charged with establishing 
links with the community and 
devising a strategy for dealing with 
the city. From the beginning there 
were serious problems with the 
Council. Apparently because of 
Brewster's concern with Yale's 
"mission" and because of his tenden· 
cy to view the situation in national 
terms, he was reluctant to appoint 
men to the Council familiar with the 
community. With few exceptions, 
Brewster appointed sons of Eli who 
had acquired reputations either at 
Yale or nationally. Only Ernest 
Osborne, who had been with theRe-
development Agency, Herbert Ca-
hoon, Director of Yale Volunteer 
Services, and Samuel.Slie, an as-

A. Whitney Griswold, the sixteenth leader of 
Yale, died of cancer on April19, 1963. Under the 
Yale Corporation's by-laws the recently appointed 
provost, forty-three year old Kingman Brewster, 
Jr., became acting president. He was, as well, the 
leading candidate for head of the university, and it 
was rumored that Griswold had wanted him to 
have the post. Despite Brewster's pre-eminence 
as a candidate, the Corporation spent the spring 
and summer studying the nature of the office and 
seeking nominees. Having made all the necessary 
motions (whether they were real or symbolic will 
not be known until the committee records are 
opened many years from now), the Corporation 
elected Kingman Brewster president in October 
1963. 

The new president appeared in many ways to 
fit the traditional mold of a leader of Yale. Of 
impeccable lineage (a descendant of the famous 
Brewster of the Mayflower), he had attended Yale, 
served as chairman of the News, been tapped for 
Skull and Bones (which he refused because he dis-
approved of the secrecy of senior societies), and 
selected by his class as the one "who had done 
most for Yale." After service as a navy pilot 
in World War II, Brewster had attended Harvard 
Law School and then, after a brief tour with the 
Marshall Plan and a period at M.I.T., he had re-
turned to Harvard to serve on the faculty. He had 
been brought to Yale in 1!}60 as·provost by his 
summer neighbor on Martha's Vineyard, Whitney 
Griswold. 

Brewster believed deeply in freedom, respon-
sibility, and the need to make moral choices. 
He thought success should be related to effort and 
that the fullness of life could be measured by the 
extent to which a man felt he had an impact on the 
lives of others. He was convinced a leader should 
act decisiv~ly. Withal, he was fundamentally a 
pragmatist. Unlike most of his predecessors in 
the presidential office, he was ttot an intellectual. 
As he confessed to Time magazine, "I get more 
stimulation by talking to people than by retreat-
ing to the library-it's out of the hurly-burly 
that I get my ideas." The change from Griswold 
was noticeable. Time observed that Brewster 
was "an ear-wearying speaker whose official utter-
ances are frequently pedantic and dull." They 
were sometimes repetitive in content as well. His 
written reports often lacked clarity and eloquence. 
In small groups the president was at his best-
here his wit, intelligence, and sense of fun could 
come quickly to the fore. Although he later 
largely overcame the failings in his speaking and 
writing, those shortcomings-along with a some-
what naive assumption that Yale's greatness 
needed no selling to anyone-were rapidly to com-
plicate his relations with the always powerful 
alumni of Yale College. 

Those difficulties were hidden in the future, 
however, as Brewster' a presidency began with the 
most elaborate inaugural ceremony-even includ-
ing a ball in Ingalls Rink-ever seen at conser-
vative old Yale. Charles, it seemed, was succeed-
ing Cromwell. 

1 The bonanza years 
Kingman Brewster's goal for Yale, as he soon 
made clear, was to make it the very best in every-
thing it tried to do, and to justify its existence by 
sharing its greatness with others via television 
and other modem devices. He wanted to make 
sure that Yale had as great an impact on the 
generation to come as it had on the generation 
past. To these ends, he intended to organize it 
well, to see that it used its existing financial and 
intellectual resources to the full, and to increase 
those resources to enable it to do more things 
better. 

One of Brewster's first efforts was to modern-
ize university organization. During the Griswold 
era the university's expenditures had grown from 
$15 million to nearly $50 million, but administra-
tive development had lagged behind the rapid 
change. No doubt the university was better or-
ganized than it had been in Charles Seymour's 
day nearly 30 years before (when the president 
could still take the time to personally reject a re-
quest from the dean of Yale College for $300 to 
purchase maps for teaching), but there still re-
mained much to do to bring the institution under
