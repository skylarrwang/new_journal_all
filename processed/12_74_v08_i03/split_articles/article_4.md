city planning department. This last situation 
occurred when the department admitted students 
for the fall of 1969 without the required consulta-
tion with the dean of Art and Architecture. The 
president then stripped the chairman of the de-
partment of his administrative responsibilities 
and sent letters to the students so admitted 
advising them not to come to Yale for city 
planning since the future of that department was 
in doubt. 

Great activity that spring on the part of the 
president-almost nightly he attended meetings 
in the various residential colleges-no doubt 
played an important part in keeping any issue 
from reaching the level of a cause celebre and 
Yale completed the academic year 1968-69.peace-
fully. Then disaster struck. Shortly after the 
departure of most students for the summer, "a 
mysterious and devastating fire swept through 
three floors of the Art and Architecture build-
ing dUring the early morning hours of June 14,, as 
the Yale Alumni Magazine reported. Though 
arson was immediately suspected, a six week 
investigation by the fire department produced no 
evidence of it. Still, the possibility lingered 
for the investigation produced no indication of 
what had caused the blaze. 

Hardly had the academic year 1969-70 gotten 
under way when the Law School became embroiled 
in problems. Complaints by black students of 
police harassment and the failure of the uni-
versity to intervene with what the blacks thought 
was sufficient energy produced first the disruption 
of a few classes and finally a boycott of classes by 
about half the student body. That crisis 
(and the interminable meetings which always 
accompanied these affairs) was just drawing to a 
close, when the college was alarmed by the occupa-
tion of the personnel supervisor's office and incar-
ceration there of four university officials. This 
contretemps had been produced by the Students 
for a Democratic Society in a demonstration 
against what they considered the ·university's 
ill-treatment of a black waitress who either quit 
(the dining hall manager's story) or was fired 
(she said) after a dispute with a white bursary 
student in which she tossed a glass of orange juice 
in his face. 

As in the other situations, sensitive treat-
ment of the problem by university officials 
prevented an explosion, but theY ale College 
faculty showed its riSing impatience with 
student activism. When the college executive 
committee let the students off with only pro-
bation, tlie faculty was extremely annoyed. 
They met three times to discuss the handling of 
the incident and then, failing even to refer to the 
action of the executive committee, went on 
record as expecting that "physical restriction, 
coercion, or intimidation of any member" of the 
university would "ordinarily result in temporary 
or permanent separation from the college." 

It was with this background of events, 
combined with deep-felt concern throughout the 
university over the war in Vietnam, the My Lai 
atrocities, the 1968 election (and especially the 
Democratic convention), the trial of the Chicago 7, 
and what appeared in newspaper reports to be an 
attempt by the police to eradicate the Black 
Panthers, that the Alex Rackley case broke on 
New Haven. Rackley, a New Haven Black 
Pantlier, had been found dead near Middlefield, 
Connecticut-his body bullet-riddled and bearing 
torture marks. Police thereupon rounded up 
various New Haven Panthers. Bobby Seale, 
National Chairman of the party, was picllced 
California on an extradition warrant c~tar~~g 
with ordering Rackley's death. 

The Rackley case (or that of the New Haven 
9, as some called it) began to produce concern 
and discontent during the winter of 1970. In 
part this situation was caused, as John Hersey 
(B.A. 1936), the Master of Pierson College, ex-
plained in his Letter to the Alumni, by 
an outfit calling itself the Panther Defense 
Committee, led by a white radical from New 
York named Thomas Dostou, joined by a few 
Yale dropouts, [which] set itself up in town 
and began making statements, some of them 
violently provocative, about the trial, and in 
due course it announced that, with the sup-
port of the seven defendants (besides Seale) 
in the Chicago conspiracy trial, a huge rally 
would be held on May 1 with the ominously 
stated purpose of "ending" the trial. 

Beginning about the middle of April, the level 
of concern began to rise at Yale. Meetings were 
held, attended by William Kunstler, lawyer for the 
Chicago 7, Doug Miranda, captain of the New 
Haven Panthers, Big Man {Elbert HQward), 
the Panther's Deputy Minister of Information, 
and Artie Seale, Bobby's wife. As the content of 
the rhetoric became increasingly violent, the 
judge in the case, Harold Mulvey, over-reacting 
to a generally tense situation, sentenced David 
Hilliard and Emory Davis, two national Black 
Panther leaders, to six months in jail for contempt 
of court because of a trivial incident. "And 
so," as Hersey well put it, "the mindset was 
prepared for confrontational hysteria." 

The release of Hilliard and Douglas a few 
days later, after they had apologized to Judge 
Mulvey, did little to quiet concern. Nor did Chap-
lain Coffin's declaration that the trial might be 
legally right but morally wrong and his call for a 
non-violent march on the courthouse. 

Amass meeting of students was held at 
Ingalls Rink the night Hilliard and Douglas were 
released (April 21 ), to discuss going out on strike 
to protest against the trial. The meeting of some 
4500 to 5000 students was marked by an element 
of hysteria in the audience, a clash between the 
crowd and Hilliard {when he said there was 
nothing wrong with killing police), and Hilliard's 
page7 
body guards "roughing up" an overly excited 
architecture student who wanted to speak. 

After the meeting, which, according to 
Hersey, turned nearly everyone against violence, 
the students returned to their colleges to vote on 
whether or not to strike. At this point there was 
mass confusion-some going on strike and others 
refusing to. Support of the strike, a term various-
ly defined, ranged from nearly unanimously in 
favor of it {at Calhoun and Silliman Colleges) to 
strongly against it {at Saybrook). 

As the students were trying to decide what 
they would do, another group was trying to reach 
a conclusion about what Yale was striking for. 
The Strike Steering Committee, made up of 
"representatives of all12 residential colleges, 
graduate schools [sic], law school, drama school, 
black medical students, black faculty, Coalition of 
Concerned Women and the Third World Organi-
zation," worked out a tentative series of strike 
demands. Only then did it become clear that a 
whole series of student discontents were to be 
voiced in the strike. There was something for 
everyone, from a demand that "theY ale Corpora-
tion call for the immediate dismissal of charges 
against the nine Panthers," through complaints 
against Yale's physical expansion in the city, calls 
for day care centers for the children of Yale 
employees and "adequate wage and workman's 
compensation and retirement plans" for the 
workers, to an end to " all plans and construction 
of the Social Science Center and Institute" 
{which some students charged would manipulate 
people). 

These demands were by no means accepted by 
all students. Still, by April 24 the first edition of 
the Strike Newspaper, which had sprung into exis-
tence at Dwight Hall, estimated that attendance 
at classes was "down 65-75 per cent though some 
science classes report 45 per cent attendance." 
The paper also said, 

Most of the Humanities and Social Science 
classes still held are discussing the Seale 
trial, the Panther's situation, and Yale's re-
lation to the community. The Drama School, 
Music School and School of Art and Archi-
tecture have ceased normal activity. 

On Thursday, April23, the Yale College 
faculty met in Sprague Hall to decide what action 
they should take. Instead of the approximately 
100 members who might atte~d a normal faculty 
meeting, 450 of the 700 college teachers appeared. 
Outside, a mob of student demonstrators 
gathered. 

President Kingman Brewster was clearly 
scheduled to speak first, but he yielded the floor to 
Professor Roy Bryce-Laporte representing the 
black faculty {a dozen or so of whom were sitting 
together in the front of the room). After "a long 
impassioned preamble," he introduced a resolu-
tion which called upon Yale to recognize "essen-
tial human and constitutional rights" by sus-
pending normal academic functions, to establish a 
fund made up of faculty contributions "to deal 
with any financial aspects that might arise from 
the present situation," to support a national con-
ference of black organizations at Yale, and, in 
John Hersey's words, 

to establish a commission with representa-
tives from the New Haven black community 
and from the University to discuss Yale-

community relations, especially issues of 
land expansion and housing. 

Bryce-Laporte made it clear that the black faculty 
would tolerate little, if any, modification of their 
resolution. 

With this powerful demand before the faculty 
and with the sounds of the crowd echoing outside, 
Kingman Brewster rose to speak. He announced 
that he saw two issues currently disturbing Yale: 
"The first is the trial of Panther members; the 
second is Yale's relation to the community." 

While he made it clear that Yale wished to see 
justice done in both cases, and was ready to assist 
faculty members to monitor the trial, report on its 
development, and review it fairness, he rejected 
any outright contribution of university money to 
the defense of the Panthers (which some were cal-
ling for). There was, he said, "an absolute legal 
barrier'' to such a use of university funds. Follow-
ing his remarks on the university's position in the 
crisis, Brewster made a comment for which he 
was later to be strongly criticized. Probably 
wishing to show students and black faculty that, 
despite the necessity for Yale as an institution 
to remain neutral, he, as an individual, was not 
unsympathetic with their fears, he said, 

I personally want to say that I am appalled 
and ashamed that things should have come 
to such a pas's that I am skeptical of the 
ability of black revolutionaries to achieve a 
fair trial anywhere in the United States. 

Then, after a few more remarks, he closed his 
statement by calling for everyone to "cool rather 
than heat up the atmosphere in which the trial will 
be held.'' In the context of the meeting and the 
times, the president's "skepticism" statement 
was hardly as shocking as when it appeared in the 
nation's press. Some years later he explained, 

My decision was not a simple self-indulgence 
of my right of free speech. It was the result 
of a deliberate balance of judgement about 
what' degree of speaking out was best for the 
University under the circumstances: how to 
avoid excessive exploitation of the presiden-
tial office, and how to avoid being a moral 
eunuch on a morally anguished campus. 

After Brewster spoke to the faculty, others 
introduced a resolution calling for the week of 
Apri127 to May 2 to be used for "critical discus-
sion, reasoned analysis, and informed debate 
about issues and proposals." Students and facul-
ty could pursue this end in any way they wished. 
The resolution specifically condemned "force, 
coercion, obstruction or violence." It was clear, 
however, that in the face of the black faculty reso-
lution, their carefully considered proposal had no 
chance to pass. 

At this point Dean Georges May, who was 
presiding, announced that the students gathered 
outside wanted the faculty to listen to their repre-
sentative. May said their spokesman was a de-
pendable and trustworthy young man named Kurt 
Schmoke, and he suggested that the faculty cir-
cumvent their rules against the presence of non-
faculty at their meetings by "adjourning" to hear 
him. 

After the faculty had adjourned, Schmoke, a 
black member of the class of 1971 and its perma-
nent secretary, appeared on the platform. In a 
brief and moving address, Schmoke asked the 
faculty to give the confused and frightened stu-
dents moral leadership. As one observer later 
wrote, "When he left, the entire faculty rose to its 
feet as an expression of homage to the courtesy of 
his speech and the charm of his person.'' 

The faculty then turned to the difficult task 
at hand. Led by Brewster and Kenneth Mills, a 
black assistant professor of philosophy, the facul-
ty altered the original resolution to call for a sus-
pension of normal academic "expectations." A 
section specifically condemning violence was ad-
ded. The two and a half hour meeting then ended 
with the passage of the slightly altered resolution. 
Those faculty members who were opposed to this 
decision were, it appears, caught off guard by the 
speed with which the faculty acted. They were 
furthermore, in an uncomfortable position. Any 
opposition to the resolution, no matter how re-
strained, was liable to be termed "racist." 

George Pierson did suggest, according to Hersey's 
account of the meeting, "that momentous actions 
were being precipitately taken, and he urged ad-
journment and a day's reflection." But the facul-
ty was not to be halted. Many members 
undoubtedly felt that unless the black faculty and 
the students got some clear-cut action which

showed the depth of theY ale College faculty con-
cern, any number of catastrophic events might occur. 

began to roam the campus trying (unsuccessfully) 
to shut down any class, library, or intellectual 
activity that continued. Charges and counter-
charges echoed across the land, against Yale for 
the so-called shutdown, and against Brewster for 
his statement of skepticism. Attacks on the presi-
dent by a judge, the Governor of Connecticut, and 
Vice President Agnew (among other&), helped to 
unify Yale behind Brewster. But there was some 
concern about his leadership in the crisis. One 
conservative student feared that the president 
was politicizing Yale in order to save it. He 
warned, in the Yale Daily News, that both the 
president and the university might become "even 
more removed from the people outside," and in the 
process Brewster and Yale might be irrevocably 
weakened. 

Whatever these decisions meant for Y.ale's 
long-term future, the university as a teaching 
institution was rapidly shutting down and prepar-
ing for the onslaught of participants in the May 
Day demonstration. Only the Medical and 
Nursing Schools continued much a.s usual. 

All the students' love for extracurricular 
affa.irs now surfaced as they got ready for May 
Day. In his Letter to the Alumni, Jolm Hersey 
gave a fascinating glimpse of "by no means all" 
the activities at Yale on just one day, shortly be- · 
fore the feared arrival of the demonstrators: 

Picketeers meet at breakfast in their residen-
tial colleges at 8:00a.m. to get their orders 
for the day. A group in Branford College 
attempts to set up a free breakfast program 
for New Haven children that is not connected 
with the Black Panthers. The Strike Steer-
ing Committee calls a press conference of the 
sixty to eighty out-of-town news reporters 
who have come to cover the weekend car-
nage. Italian-speaking students (haircuts 
available at Silliman College, 50 cents) go 
out to canvass key Italian neighborhoods, 
carrying leaflets with pictures of Sacco and 
V anzetti. A meeting for Theological Reflec-
tion in the Divinity School at 10 a.m. Study 
group forms to investigate restrictions put 
on faculty members by their departments. 
Those planning to work as medic aides are 
assembled for instruction. An ad in Strike 
Newspaper announces a meeting for SPIR-
ITUAL MEDICS: ''Help convert the energy 
into good energy: high-centered people need-
ed as spiritual medics ... Don't underestimate 
yourself!'' Yale Coalition of Concerned 
Women recruits marshals: "Women are more 
effective as marshals in preserving a non-
violent situation." Davenport College being 
converted into a childcare center for the 
weekend. Three lectures at the Law School: 
"Arrest and Search," "Immunity and Con-
tempt," "Conspiracy." A "Rock Expertise" 
group<:al.ls for ''people experienced in stage 
management, light-shows, equipment hand-
ling, politics, the logistics of large concerts, 
and bizarre business in general." There is a 
"law table" in each college at lunch. Stu-
dents distribute "fact sheets" on the Panther 
trial at the gates of the Olin Mathieson Win-
chester arms factory. Silk screeners print 
posters. Filmmakers coalesce into a unity 
called May First Media. The Strike News-
paper staff turns out its daily stint. The 
Medical Committee for Human Rights sets 
up first aid stations. A murmuration of 
meetings in the colleges on housing, feeding, 
communicating. Teach-ins and teach-outs in

college common rooms and out on the town; 
community residents teach students, and 
vice versa. An afternoon lecture in Morse 
College on "Coloniz~Jtion and Race in Planta-
tion America." Ad Hoc Faculty Resource 
Group holds an open forum in Strathcona 
Hall on "Psychology of Racism." The var-
sity lacrosse team crushes Williams 13-4. A 
training meeting for marshals is held in 
Dwight Chapel. The Student-Faculty Moni-
toring Committee announces its concern 
about the organization and planning of the 
weekend demonstrations. Drama students 
put on a psycho-drama in Morse College "to 
investigate physically and emotionally the 
energies and tensions arising from the cur-
rent crisis." The Russian Chorus gives a 
benefit for Panther defense. The Rogues' 
Trial, a contemporary Brazilian comedy is 
staged in Stiles College as a benefit for 
BSA Y; "come to relieve your head," the 
notice advises. Mass meeting at Ingalls 
Rink. 

This hectic activity was further stimulated as 
reports and rumors circulated of the theft of guns, 
of fires at the Law School and Wesleyan Universi-
ty, of the arrival of Hell's Angels from California, 
of the alerting of federal troops. New Haven 
stores were boarded up. Schools closed. 

May Day dawned warm and sunny and 
beautiful. At first it appeared that what was 
sometimes known as "Kingman's luck" had 
failed. But perhaps it was luck after all. The ac-
tivities on the green were more like a country fair 
than a protest. Rock groups played Q.Dd represen-
tatives of a wide variety of causes spoke intermi-
nably. Both Women's and Gay Liberation made 
their cases. A skywriter put a great peace symbol 
in the clear blue sky over the mob. The crowd of 
15-20,000 {instead of the feared 50,000) was alter-
nately bored and entertained, but seldom very ex-
cited. Though attempts were made by a few uni-
dentified individuals to foment trouble both Fri-
day and Saturday nights {and the smell of tear gas 
swept through the campus and .,stung many eyes), 
excellent work by Panthers, police, civilian mar-
shals, the black community, andY ale students 
kept the confrontations small. Fortunately, the 
Connecticut National Guard, which was on the 
scene and was later reported to have been carrying 
live ammunition, retained its self-control. Per-
haps it helped that some of its members were 
Yale students. 

The major untoward event of the weekend 
was the explosion of several bombs in the stair-
wells of Ingalls Rink. Fortunately, a rock concert 
had just ended when the bombs went off, and only 
75 to 100 persons remained in the building to be 
knocked down by the force of the blast. No one 
was seriously injured and the $50-100,000 worth of 
damage to the rink could be repaired. 

But even with the departure of the crowd 
{Coffin claimed, " we licked them with love" ), the 
Yale strike did not end. Though the people of Yale 
had united in the face of the onslaught, now the in-
vaders were gone and Brewster still had to reply 
to the demands of the strike committee. He 
promised that Yale would assist faculty members 
to work for a fair trial, and the university would 
try to play a more constructive role in New Haven, 
especially through a new joint Yale and communi- . 
ty housing and development corporation. A plan 
for a day care center would go forward on an ex-
perimental basis. Employee benefits, he said, 
would have to be studied in the light of a new 
federal law and contract negotiations with the 
union which were coming up the following year. 
He defended both the social science center and 
institute. 

On the same day that he gave his reply to the 
Strike Committee, Brewster announced that "reg-
ular academic expectations" would be restored in 
all schools on Tuesday, May 5. But the Strike 
Committee rejected Brewster's reply, broadened 
its demands {especially condemning the recent in-
cursions of U.S. forces in Cambodia), and at-
tempted to keep theY ale strike alive as part of the 
national student strike which was then under way. 
Though most faculty members and numerous stu-
dents returned to the classroom, many other 
undergraduates did not. Picketing became, as one 
strike leader put it, "as coercive as possible with-
out hitting people." The killing of students at 
Kent State by the National Guard hardly helped 
to calm the situation at Yale. But since atten-
dance was not taken in classes, no one knew 
exactly how many students were still on strike. 

Trying to remain at the head of the university 
and keep its support, Brewster and 1200 students 
went off to Washington to "talk to the Yale 
graduates who are members of Congress" about 
how to stop the war, how to counter the "White 
House effort to isolate and make scapegoats of 
universities and their students," and how to elect 
anit-war congressmen. 

The academic year 1969-70 finally straggled 
to a strange, disjointed end. Most of the students 
went home, though some did not complete all their 
work until fall. But Kingman Brewster had to 
remain behind to face the wrath of the alumni who 
returned for reunion. 

6 Survival for what purpose? 
Most Yale graduates were not, apparently, 
grateful to Brewster for getting Yale through May 
'~)age 9 
Day and the strike without a disaster. Instead, they 
were furious at him for his "skepticism" state-
ment, for politicizing {as they thought) the univer-
sity during the strike and his trip to Washington, 
and for all the old issues of admissions procedures, 
the R.O.T.C., and Coffin and Lynd. Brewster 
tried hard to explain the actions he had taken 
during the difficult days of spring. But it is 
doubtful the alumni were willing to listen. They 
thought he was destroying Yale and they were 
showing their displeasure in the most obvious 
way- gifts were falling off. Not only had the 
alumni fund failed to make its target, but the 
development office reported to the Yale Alumni 
Magazine, 

We have raised about 27 per cent of the cap-
ital goal [of $443 million] with 36 per cent of 
the time elapsed. The average level of new 
commitments is substantially below the $50 
million per year required to fulfill our goals. 

As Yale began 1970-71, Kingman Brewster 
told the newly entered freshmen that while 
the question of Yale's survival was not ''prepos-
terous," he did not think it was the most impor-
tant question. "Yale will probably survive ... ," he 
said. "The real question is survival for what pur-
pose?" And in his annual report, dated just one 
day after his speech to the freshmen, he remarked 
that during the past year it had occurred to him 
"that some day Yale might cease to exist in recog-
nizable form as a free, internationally significant 
institution." Yale had been endangered, he 
pointed out, like all universities, by suggested 
changes in tax laws and the attacks of federal 
officials. These threats had not damaged Yale, he 
reported, but they showed the danger clearly: "A 
university cannot survive without the support of 
society in general, its alumni in particular." What 
it all came down to was that "Yale's freedom and 
integrity and quality depend upon their [the ·. 
alumni's) tangible and intangible support. Sur-
vival itself is in the balance." 

Another serious problem to which the presi-
dent referred in his report on the year 1969-70 was 
the relationship to the local New Haven communi-
ty. Yale, he made clear, would have to cooperate 
with the community to help the city solve its 
problems, but without becoming just a service 
institution for New Haven. 

Yale had a two-point agenda for the year 
ahead, Brewster concluded, 

in addition, of course, to the desperate effort 
to maintain our quality and our momentum 
in the face of shrunken resources and inflated 
costs. That agenda is: to take measurable 
and significant steps to put Yale's relation-
ship with its alumni and Yale's relationship 
with its own urban neighborhood on a more 
adequate basis. 

Certainly the need to solve these problems 
was great and ever-increasing. Yale was under 
rising pressure from the city administration to 
pay taxes and from city blacks to stop the univer-
sity's growth into their neighborhoods and to 
share its resources more freely with them. And an 
alumni committee bluntly reported that " for 
alumni of all ages, persuasions, backgrounds, and 
interests, Yale is no longer a given, unexamined 
good."
