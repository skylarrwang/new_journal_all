Standing at the threshold of society, 
newly released inmates plan their next steps

Hudson Street, just off of Whalley Avenue, looks 
like any other street after a hard winter. The as­
phalt is pocked with fresh potholes, the sidewalks 
cracked from months of ice. Debris litters the edg­
es of the road—stray tires, plastic bottles, scraps of 
clothing, a discarded pair of shoes. The shoes look like 
black-and-white low-top Converse, but their rubber 
soles are thinner and flimsier, and the ripped canvas 
bears no insignia. They are state-issued prison sneak­
ers, given to inmates by the Department of Correction

On one side of the street is a row of houses with 
small front yards; on the other is a row of cellblocks 
behind barbed wire. This is the New Haven Com­
munity Correctional Center, commonly known as 
Whalley Jail. 
Roughly eighty male prisoners are released each 
month at the jail’s back gate on Hudson Street. On 
average, twenty-five of these men are released directly 
from the county jail. The rest are dropped there from 
prisons all over Connecticut. They walk out in the ear­
ly morning hours, quietly and inconspicuously.

At around 6:30 a.m., a white minibus with gold 
and blue trim pulls into the gate’s entryway. A cor­
rectional officer sits in the driver’s seat holding a clip­
board. The passenger windows are tinted and rein­
forced with metal mesh. The gate slides open, and the 
bus drives through. After a moment, the gate closes. 
The officer walks into the building and returns 
a few minutes later. He opens the door of the bus, 
and three men file out. They wear DOC-issued cloth­
ing—long-sleeved white shirts and loose white or tan 
pants. Each man’s wrists are bound by metal cuffs that 
connect to a chain around his waist. They rattle as they 
walk through the sally port, the controlled release area 
at the back of Whalley Jail.

At 7:00 a.m., the three men reemerge. The cuffs 
are gone. In place of prison tans, one man now wears 
a pair of blue jeans. Another wears a checkered flannel 
shirt. Each man holds a brown paper bag full of his 
possessions. 

They stand behind the gate, waiting for it to open. 
The man in the middle bounces up and down. 
“I fuckin’ hate this place,” he says, as much to 
himself as to the two men beside him, who nod in 
agreement. 

The gate begins to open. As soon as it slides wide 
enough to fit through, the three men rush out onto 
the sidewalk, smiling. Two of them take a left out of 
the gate and begin walking toward Whalley Avenue. 
“You got any smokes?” one man asks me as he 
passes by. 
“Nah man, sorry.”

The third man, still in full prison clothes, turns 
right out of the gate. He is practically running, but he 
stops when he sees the pair of shoes on the sidewalk. 
“Somebody left they skippies,” he says, laughing. 
He pauses, then continues down the street. He rounds 
the corner. Only moments have passed since the gate 
opened, and already all three men have disappeared 
from view. But where are they going?

An inmate in the Connecticut DOC can ar­
range to be picked up at the end of his sentence 
from the facility where he has served his time. 
He also has the option of requesting DOC transport to 
one of four drop-off sites: Middletown Courthouse, 
Hartford Courthouse, Bridgeport Correctional Cen­
ter, or New Haven Correctional Center. If there is no 
one to pick him up from the drop-off site he chooses, 
the DOC provides a 90-minute bus pass upon release. 
Men who choose to be dropped off at Whalley Jail 
typically return to New Haven or to a nearby town. 
The same is true for women, who are let out near the 
police department headquarters on Union Avenue. 

I went to Whalley Jail each morning for two 
weeks to meet men as they were released. Even those 
who had been incarcerated for a short time—less 
than a year—spoke of the anxiety of reintegration and 
the uncertainty of what lay ahead. After a long pe­
riod of living under prison conditions, the first steps 
back into society can be overwhelming. The world 
they return to is neither fully prepared nor totally 
willing to support men coming out of prison. Em­
ployment is hard to come by, especially while many 
ex-offenders grapple with housing instability or 
chronic health problems. Returning to high-risk areas 
can trigger relapse, into substance abuse or crime. 

A 2008 study by the Connecticut Department 
of Corrections found that forty-seven percent of ex-
offenders return to prison within two years of re­
lease, twenty-one percent within the first six months. 
Yet many New Haven residents regard ex-offenders 
as a threat, rather than a population in need. Sev­
eral years ago, the local community protested the 
release of the men directly onto the busy thorough­
fare of Whalley Avenue. For that reason, they now 
walk onto sleepy Hudson Street, out of sight and 
out of mind.
