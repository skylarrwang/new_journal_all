Community Engagement and Civic Pride.” Randall 
cited the Inside Out New Haven photo series as an 
example of what photography could accomplish. In 
2012, he and other Inside Out photographers mount­
ed four-by-six-foot black-and-white portraits of New 
Haven residents onto the underpasses that divide 
neighborhoods around State Street. Drivers would 
stop, meet each other, get their photo taken, and then 
continue on. 
For Kerekes, ILNH is an effort to shift the me­
dia’s focus away from crime reports. “‘If it bleeds, it 
leads,’ seems to be the policy. When I was 30, I moved 
to New Haven, and its reputation just didn’t match 
the experience,” he says. A neighbor told him he 
shouldn’t go out after dark. “I laughed at him, but he 
was dead serious.”

We lapse into technical conversations about RAW 
files and Photoshop, how best to organize memory 
cards. Kerekes gives no gratuitous smiles. He talks 
with his eyebrows instead. When I ask whether or not 
he loves the Elm City more after founding ILNH, his 
eyebrows shoot up and then knit themselves together 
as he considers his answer. He pauses, and then says 
he isn’t sure. But do his subjects? “Some do, some 
don’t,” he says.

He leans forward and whispers, “That’s why we 
chose the name, I Love New Haven. After a while, 
hopefully people feel that way.”

With Randall, New Haven seems like a smaller 
version of itself, one where a police officer on a bike 
waves to us in a quiet neighborhood. Randall photo­
graphs a security guard who worked with him at the 
Winchester factory when he made shotgun barrels 
from 1998 to 1999. He also runs into a law profes­
sor and a hot dog stand owner in a space of fifteen 
feet, and embraces them as close personal friends. 
The Yale Security guard in front of Willoughby’s yells 
across York Street that Randall just missed the Ash­
ley’s ice cream truck—he knows that Randall goes to 
Ashley’s almost every day.

ILNH’s lens, the “Main Street” it represents an idyll 
constructed by a dreamer and a pragmatist?

As I browsed the posts on ILNH’s website with 
Carlton Heath, a 20-year-old chemistry student at 
Gateway Community College and a friend of Kerekes’s, 
he asked where the photos of Newhallville were.  
“Growing up there, I’ve seen everything. There’s 
a basketball court off Shelton Avenue, and once I was 
just having fun, playing basketball, and four teenagers 
on bicycles, in broad daylight—they started shooting 
at it. And they rode off so casually, like nothing hap­
pened.” Heath smiles bitterly. “Every night they used 
to shoot, every single night. And that’s still the way it 
is, it’s just not being put on the news as often.”

Yet, several months later, in March 2015, Heath 
invited Kerekes to follow him through Newhall­
ville. They took dozens of pictures, including a por­
trait of Heath at a basketball court. Heath wrote in 
the ILNH.com post, “There may not be luxurious 
homes and buildings over here but there are many 
luxurious people with dreams and ideas for bettering 
this community.” 

Randall could have said the same. He, at least, 
feels that ILNH has brought him closer to his neigh­
bors across the city: “Maybe it’s just because I’ve taken 
pictures so much…But I want us to feel like we’re all 
in this together, and this is a good place to be.” Af­
ter following his path through downtown, I feel like 
I’ve observed an organic experiment in cross-city in­
timacy. Randall is an optimist, undoubtedly, but as the 
site’s popularity increases, feedback from residents 
like Heath has the potential to alter its direction, ex­
panding the edges of the frame. 
ILNH is rooted in a love of photography, the 
spontaneous connection of a street portrait. “Ulti­
mately, what I want to do is depict people as people. 
To me, everybody has a story and everybody has an 
interesting face,” Randall says. 
Stick around New Haven long enough, and he’ll 
let you know in person.
