EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
When I visit his shop in March, the inside looks simi­
lar to an REI. There are sleeping bags, water filtration 
devices, shoes, backpacks, and first aid kits. A couple 
spends at least half an hour chatting with Harris about 
his collection of duck decoys, set up in the back cor­ner of the store. 


Harris admits there is a good deal of overlap be­
tween backpackers and preppers, and it can be hard 
to tell them apart based on their purchases. Many 
outdoor enthusiasts read the shop’s slogan, “Pre­
pared for every adventure,” and don’t recognize the 
range of meanings the words “prepared” and “ad­
venture” can assume. Talking to Frank, Higgins, and 
others, I get the impression that they might relish 
a shit-hits-the-fan moment as a kind of adventure, 
maybe even as an opportunity for heroism. But they 
still bear little resemblance to the Doomsday Prep­
pers who are morbidly convinced of imminent de­
struction. I ask Harris what he thinks about the show 
and its depiction of excessive consumption of niche 
products as the route to salvation. He says the people 
on Doomsday Preppers just aren’t very good at prep­
ping.
“Honestly, I think they’re stupid to be on that 
show, because they’re disclosing all the things you 
shouldn’t be disclosing,” he says, referencing their 
exhibition of their bunkers, food supplies, and back­
up generators, now vulnerable to attack or theft. 
“They sold themselves to the devil.”


Harris’s response to Doomsday Preppers points to 
the eventual limits of some preppers’ desire to help 
one another in crisis situations. A certain degree of 
secrecy is crucial to survive in a world of scarcity 
and competition. Even when the catastrophic event 
is a natural disaster, the use of physical force against 
other people must be on the table. As Frank puts it, 
New Orleans descended into anarchy within a few 
days of Hurricane Katrina. Stockpiled food is only as 
good as your ability to defend it. No one at the medi­
cal training class mentioned it, but the hotdogs and 
potato chips in Provost’s kitchen were secure; after 
one woman had to remove her pistol holster to try 
on Wyman’s thigh rig, I looked around the room and 
realized nearly every adult was carrying a weapon.


At Wyman’s course, someone’s box of bul­
lets spills over a coffee table in the Provosts’ living 
room. One of Provost’s daughters wanders through. 
She leans over the coffee table and rolls the bullets 
under her tiny fingers. Their cold metal casing slides 
across the wooden surface. The potential for violence 
is omnipresent, even casual, but there’s not much dis­
cussion about how to take down the gunman or the 
home invader. The class is all about what to do once 
the fighting stops. 


Because self-defense seems to be a crucial com­
ponent of prepping, I wanted to talk with people as 
they actively work on their ability to fight. In Febru­
ary, I learned from the CRRT Facebook group about a 
course taking place one weekend at King 33, a “public 
safety training” center in Southington. The class was 
a two-day home-defense course taught by a special 
forces veteran named Larry Vickers. Participants would 
learn how to use firearms to defend their homes and 
businesses from attack. Topics to be covered included 
“weapons manipulation, movement and approaches, 
room entry and domination, family member rescues, 
safe room set-up and defense, low light encounters, 
surgical shooting exercises, etc.” The course cost six 
hundred dollars. There would be actual shooting.  


The King 33 facility is located off Highway 84 
in a complex of former warehouses. King 33’s door 
is tiny, unremarkable relative to the enormous ware­
house behind it. At least fifty cars sprawl across the 
parking lot, bearing license plates from Pennsylvania, 
New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Delaware. 
I step inside a small foyer with a television, a 
few chairs, and a desk with a nearly emptied box of 
Dunkin’ Donuts doughnut holes. A man and woman 
who look to be in their 70s stand up from the desk. 
They are Pat and John Michaels, friends of King 33’s 
owner Chris Fields, a special operations veteran. The 
couple greets me with expressions first of concern, 
because the door is opening twenty minutes late, and 
then confusion. I don’t look like their typical client. 
After I explain that I’d like to meet participants in the 
course, John leaves through a door across the room to 
search for someone to ask about my request, leaving 
Pat and me to chat. A television is set to Fox News. On 
screen, a boat is being pummeled by violent waves 
somewhere in the Atlantic, waiting for rescue.


Pat tells me about the courses King 33 offers: pis­
tol safety, marksmanship, self-defense, women-only 
self-defense, and a slew of courses designed for law 
enforcement personnel.  The self-defense classes don’t 
require participants to use firearms, she says. “You 
should take it. Especially living in New Haven.”


After a few minutes, John Michaels returns and 
leads me through the other door into a much larger 
space—so large a car is parked inside. John explains 
that students use the car to practice defending them­
selves from an attacker waiting for shoppers incapaci­
tated by their bounteous purchases.


A higher-up comes in and apologizes: the course 
isn’t run by King 33 but by Larry Vickers, so they can’t 
give me permission to go inside the training facility or 
meet participants. 
“They’re good people, but they’re private people,” 
Michaels says. 


Besides, it’s a live-fire course with bullets that can 
draw blood, and I don’t have proper protective gear. 
IT’S IMPORTANT THAT 
PARTICIPANTS FEEL A REAL 
SENSE OF DANGER AND 
POTENTIAL PAIN, BECAUSE 
OTHERWISE THE EXPERIENCE 
WON’T MIMIC REAL LIFE, 
WHEN THE MAN TRYING 
TO HOLD YOU HOSTAGE IN 
YOUR OWN HOME WON’T BE 
SHOOTING RUBBER BULLETS.


I say goodbye to John and Pat and walk back out 
into the snow, past the dozens of cars, empty storage 
units and a rusting water tower. I start walking down 
the road, trudging away from King 33. I’ve only gone 
a few hundred feet before a car pulls up beside me and 
the driver rolls down her window. She smiles at me 
and asks if I need a ride. I tell her no, thank you. 
“Are you sure?” she nods her head at the toddler 
in the back seat. “We’re just headed up the road to 
Stop and Shop. It’s no trouble.”
That’s all right, I say. 
“Oh, are you staying at the park?” she gestures be­
hind her. I turn and look down the long, empty road, 
which must stretch onward to a place where young 
people camp even in the winter. It strikes me that she 
is probably not aware that close by, dozens of people 
are running around a warehouse in bulletproof vests, 
shooting at each other, diligently preparing to protect 
their families. She does not realize the risk she takes 
in driving through the snow without an emergency 
supply of food and medicine. She’s not thinking about 
how vulnerable she makes herself simply by living 
in America today—talking to strangers, paying for 
her groceries with a credit card, trusting that it will 
all be O.K.


I think about Frank, who seems as typical as the 
woman now offering me a ride. He told me, at the 
end of the medical disaster class, “You just never know 
what’s going to happen.”


He’s right, of course. The woman and her child 
drive away to the Stop and Shop, where the fluorescent 
lights are always bright, the number of cereal brands 
dazzles, and the imported vegetables shine. I keep 
walking through the snow.
