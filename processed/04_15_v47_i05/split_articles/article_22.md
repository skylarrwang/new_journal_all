T
he walls of Nick Provost’s suburban Connecticut 
living room are decorated with a taxidermied 
deer head and a few grandmotherish tchotchkes in 
the colors of the American flag. A flat-screen television 
occupies one corner. Provost’s three blonde daughters, 
ages 9, 8, and 7, chase each other through the room. 
About a dozen people sit around on couches, chairs, 
and stools. 

Nick Provost, a boyish 28-year-old with a warm, 
crooked smile, lies on the floor. A black strap called a 
Hasty Harness is wrapped between his legs, behind 
his back and around his armpits. The people sitting 
in a semicircle around his prone body watch care­
fully as Jason Wyman, a barrel-chested former army 
medic whose beard looks long enough to reach his 
navel, holds the ends of the strap and pulls up. One 
of Wyman’s arms is covered in ornate gothic script 
that reads, “From the gates of hell.” On the other 
arm is printed “To the halls of Valhalla.” Wyman eas­
ily drags Provost’s muscular six-foot frame using the 
lightweight contraption. Provost groans as the straps 
tightens around his upper thighs.
“My primary rule: pain is the patient’s problem,” 
Wyman says. 

The observers had come to learn, from a com­
bat medic, how to care for the victims of countless 
violent scenarios: mall shootings, car accidents, pipe 
bomb explosions, home invasions, urban riots. The 
type of disaster that might require a Hasty Harness 
seemed far away from Provost’s living room on that 
grey Saturday in November. But for the people watch­
ing Provost squirm—members of a Facebook group 
he runs called the Community Rapid Response Team 
(CRRT)—planning for the worst is a way of life. Their 
group is a small part of the vast network of Americans 
interested in disaster preparedness and self-defense. 
The “prepper” lifestyle was made famous by the Na­
tional Geographic show Doomsday Preppers—a love­
child of TLC’s Hoarders and MTV’s Cribs, with the ad­
dition of existential and often politicized dread. But 
many CRRT members, including Provost, reject that 
label, conscious of the stereotype that preppers are 
paranoid, irrational, or crazy. 

“We’re not a militia, we’re not survivalist, we’re 
not preppers,” Provost says. “We go about our normal 
lives and we prepare to take action in bad situations.”

Those “bad situations” run the gamut from a mas­
sive snowstorm to a home invasion. The good news is 
that modernity offers up a host of useful gadgets and 
gizmos, approved by the U.S. military and available for 
purchase online or at particularly well-supplied out­
door equipment stores. With a little ingenuity and a 
bit of cash (the Hasty Harness costs just twenty-five 
dollars), the average American can feel ready to fight 
whatever Mother Nature or a fellow human being 
dishes out. 

A former soldier now supervising shifts at a plant 
that manufactures nuts and bolts, Provost established 
CRRT in the summer of 2014. CRRT became the latest 
addition to a virtual world of disaster preparedness 
and self-sufficiency communities, joining the Con­
necticut Preppers group (“Preparation for when ‘IT’ 
happens!”) and the Connecticut Preppers Network 
page’s 900+ members. The CRRT group now has over 
170 members, twelve of whom paid Wyman fifty 
dollars to attend the medical course. Twenty to thirty 
regularly attend events. 

Jason Wyman, the medical instructor, spent four 
years as a military medic in Iraq. He was there in 2005, 
during the insurgency. When he came home to Maine, 
he brought with him stories of shrapnel-studded or­
gans, jellied brains, exploded limbs, the comrades he 
had saved and those he hadn’t. Now, as an instructor 
at the self-defense training company Muzzle Front, he 
teaches civilians how to do what he did. But instead 
of gearing up for patrol in Fallujah, they’re protecting 
themselves for a trip to the mall. 

The members of the CRRT focus on everyday 
disasters. I spoke with people who use downtime 
at work to browse the web for supplies and devote 
weekends to practicing marksmanship. For others, a 
trip to the grocery store is an occasion to pick up a 
few extra cans of beans to add to their stockpile. One 
man begins his daily commute by checking that the 
bag filled with medical supplies and enough food and 
water for 72 hours is still tucked safely in his car’s back 
seat. They rarely discuss such behavior with outsiders, 
who often dismiss these actions as paranoid. Quietly, 
methodically, they stock the basement shelves. 

Driven in part by nostalgia, members of the CRRT 
ultimately advocate self-sufficiency. They invoke the 
lifestyles of their grandparents to explain why they do 
what they do. Two generations ago, they insist, every 
household in America stocked enough food to last a 
week without power or transportation. Kids learned 
basic survival skills on camping trips, everyone knew 
their neighbors, and journalists told the truth. The 
off-screen, Regular Joe disaster preparedness move­
ment is rooted in the belief that Americans back then 
had less to fear, when the national lifestyle was one 
of communal sufficiency. Their behavior is a response 
to distinctly contemporary events. They’re often vio­
lent, and occasionally horrific: September 11, mass 
shootings, the financial meltdown. Responding to 
these events requires preppers, despite their nostal­
gia for a bygone way of life, to embrace the com­
plex technology and grim outlook that pervade our 
times. I am not surprised, then, that Jason Wyman was 
teaching us how to conduct triage, not how to plant 
victory gardens.  

The group in Provost’s living room reflects the 
demographics of the broader disaster prepared­
ness crowd, estimated at three million Americans 
and growing: mostly male, mostly white, mostly 
middle-aged. 

Wyman’s instruction takes up the better part of 
two hours, during which the audience asks many 
questions. Should you try to remove shrapnel from a 
patient? Where can you buy the equipment to set up 
an IV unit? Can a tampon be used to stop bleeding 
from bullet wounds?

When he finishes covering the material, Wyman 
pulls out a large brown pack and takes out its con­
tents to show everyone what to consider purchasing 
for their own medical equipment kit. 
“This is my fuckin’ murse,” he says. “Got multiple 
kinds of beard lotion because that shit’s important.” 
There are also eye drops, bandages, Ace wrap, gloves, 
a bandage with a plastic closure apparatus, and a large 
holster called a “thigh rig” that allows the wearer to 
strap supplies around their hips and both legs. 

After showing off his equipment, Wyman tells 
us to present our medical emergency kits so he can 
evaluate their strengths and weaknesses. On the couch 
beside me, a middle-aged man in a neat button-down 
shirt sets down the yellow legal pad and pen with 
which he’s been carefully taking notes.
“My kit’s in the car, but I’m not even going to go 
get it,” he says, seeming ashamed of and a little guilty 
about his substandard equipment. 

He introduced himself as Frank. Frank now lives 
in the greater Hartford area and works in real estate, 
but he traces his prepper impulse back to the long 
gasoline lines he witnessed as a 6-year-old in Con­
necticut during the 1973 oil embargo. He learned 
then that basic assumptions of American life could be 
quickly and unpredictably undermined, though he 
didn’t start prepping in earnest until a few years ago. 
He can’t pinpoint a specific event or experience that 
led him to begin stockpiling food, taking self-defense 
classes, and researching humanity’s long history of 
disasters, but he thinks the recession of 2008 made 
the world seem a more fragile place. 

In the scores of credit card-carrying customers at 
the grocery store, Frank sees a contemporary insecu­
rity. What will happen if the power goes out? Or if 
the computer systems that allow cashless transactions 
fail? The everyday technology that makes the modern 
American lifestyle so convenient, so easy, so comfort­
able, Frank says, is particularly vulnerable to attack or 
malfunction. 

Frank can rattle off a cascading list of crises end­
ing at the present: in 1859, a major coronal mass 
ejection—a burst of solar wind that caused electrical 
disturbances on earth; in the nineteen-seventies, the 
gasoline shortages; September 11; Hurricane Katrina; 
the Great Recession; Hurricane Sandy; the blizzard 
Nemo. His primary concerns are natural disasters, fi­
nancial crises, and home invasion. He considers the 
more extreme potentialities only as a kind of enjoy­
able thought experiment on prepper forums and 
Facebook groups. 

 “We’ll discuss what we would do, like if you knew 
an asteroid was coming,” he explains. “Fun stuff.”

Frank is a generalist. Like others I meet, he prides 
himself on not wasting mental energy and resources 
seriously preparing for unlikely events such as the as­
teroid collision. His approach to general preparedness 
is systematic and disciplined. And though many of 
the disasters he fears are caused by modern technol­
ogy, that same technology has enabled him to connect 
with thousands of like-minded individuals to share 
thoughts on preparedness. 

Robert Higgins, one of the CRRT’s most active 
members, owns Muzzle Front, the self-defense train­
ing business where Wyman works. Higgins thinks that 
the actions of American preppers now congregating 
en masse online would have seemed unremarkable a 
generation ago. He believes that contemporary Ameri­
cans embrace convenience more than ever before. As 
American urbanization has continued, camping and 
outdoor activities interest people less than they once 
did. In earlier generations, when people lived farther 
from shopping centers and had stronger memories 
of hardship, they were sturdier. Higgins’s parents 
were born just after the Great Depression, and they 
grew vegetables and canned them for the winter in 
his childhood. Sometime in the nineteen-nineties, he 
realized that such behavior was increasingly unusual.  

 “The more people had easy access to things, the 
less they stored things in their home,” he says. “Fis­
cally that can make sense. Why have anything sitting 
on your shelf when you could go get it at any time 
and still have access to the capital should [a disaster] 
arrive?”
