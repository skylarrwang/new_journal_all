W
hen you walk into Calling All Dolls, a doll shop 
and repair facility in Cobalt, Connecticut, the 
atmosphere feels tense. It’s as if you suddenly inter­
rupted a group conversation and everyone looked in 
a different direction, trying to ignore the intrusion. 
Dolls with moony eyes and plastic hair, porcelain dolls 
with tattered Victorian dresses, designer dolls with 
photo-realistic eyes sit across from each other, stuffed 
in a room and suspended in a disrupted moment. 
They don’t frighten the shop’s owner, Renee Silvester. 
She put them that way. She fixes them when they’re 
broken. She has been doing this for a long time. 
Things last longer than people do; that’s the great 
romance of collecting. But the popularity of kitsch 
objects is much shorter than a human lifespan. And 
so the collector’s nostalgia is split between the long­
ing for a time no one remembers and the wistful 
memory of one’s own life years ago—in a different 
world, full of different things. Silvester knows both 
impulses well, as the owner of a doll collection span­
ning the nineteenth century to the present day. But at 
heart, she is a child of the 1950s. This was the greatest 
era of American dolls, she says, when toy companies 
started using plastic instead of a wood-pulp material 
called composition. Suddenly, dolls were cheaper to 
manufacture and more durable, ushering in a new age 
of brand-name vinyl companions—Patti PlayPal, Toni, 
Boopsie, Lolly, Judy Splinters; the list goes on. (Barbie, 
who debuted in 1959, technically belongs to this era 
as well. This is irrelevant to Silvester. “Barbie doesn’t 
do it for me. I want a big doll,” she told me. “You can 
buy Barbie for five dollars in a drugstore. That’s not a 
doll in my mind.”) 

Silvester has a deep and engrossing appreciation 
for her dolls as artifacts—both of their historical era 
and her own life. She seems to define her childhood 
in terms of dolls. Growing up in a lower-middle-class 
Italian family in Cromwell, Connecticut, “you’d get 
one doll a year, at Christmas, maybe one on your 
birthday.” Silvester’s older sister Maria (who owns a 
doll shop in Florida) sewed her doll clothes from fab­
ric scraps. Silvester is proud and a little defensive of 
her upbringing. “I’m obsessed with high-quality doll 
clothes, I think, because we had to make all of our 
own when we were little girls,” she told me. But the 
skills came in handy—the wardrobe she sewed herself 
in high school won her “Best Dressed” in the year­
book’s senior superlatives. 

Silvester wanted to open a doll hospital since she 
first successfully reunited a doll’s leg with its body as 
a teenager. But her financial savvy trumped her child­
hood fantasies, so, newly married at 22, she worked 
administrative jobs at people hospitals and orthope­
dic practices. Travelling often for business, she started 
scouring antique shops for anything old and senti­
mental—mirrors, dolls, clothes. She even has a collec­
tion of fifties-era alligator purses, all made from real 
alligator skin, and topped off with a taxidermied baby 
alligator. All thirty-five of them filled the lobby of the 
orthopedic practice where she worked, until an anti-
leather activist picketed for their removal.

Throughout the early seventies, Silvester and her 
husband flipped houses. They took out loans to ac­
quire “handyman specials”—multi-family homes that 
needed major repairs—and renovated them on nights 
and weekends. They rented them out and Silvester 
managed the tenants, all the while working full time 
and raising two daughters and a son. It’s not clear how 
she managed such a huge workload. She has round­
about way of talking. Often she ends up at the logi­
cal opposite of where she started, despite finishing 
with a tone of finality. “Don’t forget—there’s no fun 
in my life. But that’s where I think I’m a little differ­
ent. The fun stuff has always been work. What’s fun 
for you, going out partying on a Friday night? Well 
for me, when I was younger, I used to go out danc­
ing at clubs. Ah, I was a maniac dancer. On tables, and 
that sort of thing.” 

Regardless of how she did the work, it paid off. 
In 1981 Silvester and her husband could finally afford 
the Captain Ralph Smith House, a 1780s-era build­
ing not far from Cobalt. “That was the Dream House,” 
Silvester recalls. Her plans changed four years later, 
when her husband died in a motorcycle accident. She 
moved out of the Dream House, but she came into 
a bit of inheritance money and was finally able to 
collect dolls seriously. She treats this tragedy-fortune 
complex matter-of-factly. “I just kept doing things 
without him. Never stopped.” 

I first visited Calling All Dolls because its name 
sounded like an escort service. I was travelling with 
two male friends at the time, and we noticed a sign 
on the store’s front lawn that said “Meet Grace, Doll of 
the Year!”  None of us had ever been inside a doll shop 
or an escort service, and we were eager to meet this 
mysterious “Doll of the Year.” We shuffled through 
deep snow to make it to the front door, where a 
small, hand-crank bell was situated at just the right 
height for a little girl. I bent down and rang it. A short 
woman in a grandmotherly fleece answered. Her big 
eyes scanned us over and steadied—it was Silvester. 
“Welcome,” she said. “You’re the first customers I’ve 
had all day.” She motioned us in and shook our hands. 
“And you’re in a little harem!”

Once inside, we were in the company of a thou­
sand un-blinking eyes. I quickly realized what sur­
rounded us—American Girl dolls, their vacant faces 
all the same. Children are her main customer base, 
Silvester explained, and they don’t like vintage dolls. 
But Silvester knows what they do like. Standing in 
the room felt like being inside of a birthday cake. 
The smooth pink plaster had white crown moldings, 
the little chandelier cast the space in a honey glow, 
and American Girls sat on every wall, table, shelf, 
and crevice in sight. The Doll of the Year was one of 
them—her name was Grace, and her signature trait 
was “Francophile”. Around her, there dolls on a table 
poised for a sleepover. An ice skater doll in a victory 
pose. A group of cool doll friends having a camping 
trip by the window. And, confusingly, a doll on the 
counter with a waxen head and a legless torso, straw 
bleeding from the stumps. 

Suddenly, a man with a hamster in each hand 
emerged from a door behind the cash register.  Silves­
ter introduced him as Jeff, her buddy that helps with 
repairs on weekends. “This is Peanut, and this is Prin­
cess,” he told me, as one of the vicious rodents wrig­
gled out of his grip and clawed at his arm. “They’re 
usually asleep. You can hold them. Peanut’s a biter.” 

“They used to be my grandchildren’s,” Silves­
ter explained. “But they got bored of them, so they 
live here now.” 

“Do you live here, too?” I asked her. 
“Yes, I do,” she said. “I have a space in the back. 
It’s also my repair room. And, of course, at night I pull 
out a sleeping bag and sleep with the dolls.” We made 
eye contact. She held it. 
“What?” I said. 
She paused for a second, with a wide, tepid smile. 
Then replied, “I’m kidding.” 

I returned to Silvester’s store a few months later, 
this time with a female friend who, Silvester noted, 
highly resembled a collection of red-haired artisan 
dolls in the store. Eager to talk, Silvester took us on a
