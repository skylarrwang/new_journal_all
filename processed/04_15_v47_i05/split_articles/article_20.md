tour. In a side room, dolls clustered in little displays, 
organized by time period and country—a group of 
rosy-cheeked German dolls from the early nineteen-
hundreds in the corner; crazed, yarn-haired nineteen-
sixties-era cloth dolls on the shelf; a subdued brunette 
in a blue dress, sitting alone. American doll compa­
nies really started in the twenties, Silvester told me. 
The brunette was one of the only American antique 
dolls made in the early twentieth century, manufac­
tured by a New Jersey company that operated from 
1918 to 1921. 

Nearby, dozens of shoddily painted Native Amer­
ican figurines populated a glass case.  “Skookums!” 
said Silvester. “This company paid housewives to as­
semble the dolls from a kit. Now, none of them look 
the same—look, some are carrying little babies! Ah.” 
She clicked her tongue and tossed her head back, 
like a southern belle swooning at a pleasant thought. 
“They’re my little Navajos.” They were all smiling and 
painted in with permanent side-eye, looking politely 
uncomfortable. Silvester said the right-side glance is a 
sign of good luck.

Next, Silvester took us to the infirmary in the 
back room. When she’s not selling American Girls to 
little children, she’s repairing their parents’ childhood 
companions, or their ancestors’ stately heirloom dolls. 
She runs this part of the business in the middle of her 
kitchen, working from three shelves of convalescent 
doll beds whose occupants have all sorts of gruesome 
injuries. A forties-era baby doll with a smashed-in 
face lay beside twin boudoir dolls from the twenties, 
naked with no eyes. Underneath them, a teddy bear 
hemorrhaged stuffing. “I spend all my time in the doll 
hospital,” Silvester said. “I never cook. Women spend 
too much time in the kitchen, that’s what I think.” 
Customers aren’t generally allowed in the hospital. 
“When little girls see a broken doll, they scream!” she 
explained. “If they see an old doll, they say, ‘ewwww.’”

The doll market is peculiar nowadays. American 
Girls, with their look-like-me appeal and their strange, 
blank uniformity, by far outsell any other eighteen-
inch doll on the market for children. Meanwhile, a 
whole community of doll artists use glass eyes, hu­
man hair, and extremely lifelike molds, creating limit­
ed-release dolls for adult collectors. 

Silvester’s favorite dolls come from one of these 
collections. They’re new, from 2005, designed by the 
German doll artist Annette Himstedt. Himstedt spent a 
year travelling the world and capturing the likenesses 
of the little girls she saw in eerily realistic vinyl. Silves­
ter has ten of them and knows all of their names. “This 
one is Natiti, my little Aborigine,” she said, stroking 
her hair. “And Tawni, she’s another Navajo. She’s my 
favorite.” Tawni’s eyes were deep-set and fuzzy with 
lashes around the edges, so attentively detailed they 
were almost cartoonish. “Those are human prosthetic 
eyes,” Silvester said, then insisted, “They’re real eyes.” 
She walked away from the doll and a little ironi­
cally, a little wistfully, smiled. “I paid one thousand 
a piece for them. Ah, I sometimes kiss them, I love 
them so much.” 

Tawni and her friends stand stepwise on the stair­
well, which is the first display customers see when 
they walk in. About eight people come into Calling 
All Dolls every day. The rest of the time Silvester is 
alone in the store, or her home, which doesn’t start or 
end anywhere distinct. She works constantly. She says 
she’s finally living her dream. Still, wandering around 
Calling All Dolls, it feels less like the realization of a 
long-held vision than a life’s retrospective, Silvester’s 
personal memory palace of dreams and experiences. 
The orthopedic practices turned a doll hospital, the 
antique Dream House an overflowing doll shop, the 
childhood memories resurrected in the staring, age­
less company of the rooms—I wonder how much Sil­
vester works, and how much she just reflects.  

Perhaps the reflection was always the point for 
Silvester. For someone who surrounds herself with 
little-girl-likenesses, she isn’t bursting with affection 
for the real ones. 

“The kids now, they don’t just want dolls. They 
want the Kindles, the iPods, and all the technology,” 
she says. But she relishes the experience her shop 
gives young visitors. “When little girls walk in here, 
they must think it’s a palace. And that’s my reward—
they’re going to remember that the rest of their lives.” 
Given Silvester’s keen sense of objects and memory, 
she’s probably right. Even if some of those enchanted 
little girls will remember accidentally wandering nto 
Silvester’s kitchen, and running out screaming, “Ah! 
What did she do to that doll’s eyes!”
