Steven’s sister helped him develop a clear plan for 
the coming days. She is going to pick him up, and she 
has an apartment ready for him back in Meriden, as 
long as he can get a job and pay rent. He’s planning to 
go back to tree removal, his old line of work.

“Without her, I’d have to go to a shelter,” he says. 
“I wouldn’t even be here right now. I’d be walking 
down Whalley Avenue blind, not knowing where I’m 
gonna pick up a dollar bill.”  

But negotiating family relationships can also 
be fraught with difficulty. Steven tells me his big­
gest concern is reconnecting with his wife of fifteen 
years, with whom he has two sons. She has a protec­
tive order against him and did not write him during 
his sentence. 

Easter weekend is coming up, and Steven believes 
that his wife will contact him when he returns to Me­
riden. “I want to be with my wife and kids for the 
holiday, eating ham,” he says. “But I’m on thin ice.”

Because of the protective order, any reports of 
abusive or threatening behavior on his part will like­
ly be a violation of Steven’s probation, which could 
send him back to prison for up to three-and-a-half 
years. This is a common problem for ex-offenders 
with histories of abuse. William “June Boy” Out­
law, a community advocate at Easter Seals Goodwill 
Reentry, a New Haven program that serves high- to 
moderate-risk ex-offenders in New Haven, explains 
to me that a record of domestic violence raises an 
immediate red flag.

	
“If I see domestic violence on a client’s re­
cord I wanna get into that,” Outlaw tells me. “I wanna 
know do he intend to reconcile the dispute. Because 
those never reconcile. The woman he was with knows 
the button to put him back in jail. She can call the 
police and say your name”—he snaps his fingers—
“and that’s it. If you don’t go back, you take your­
self out of that high-risk situation, which is usually 
better for everybody.”

Paul tells Steven he should cut ties altogether. 
That is what Paul has decided to do with his ex-
girlfriend, with whom he has three-year-old twins. 
His only tie to her now is the child support he owes.

“You’re not free when you get outta jail,” Paul 
says. “I owe four grand and counting in child sup­
port. I gotta go to probation meetings and domestic 
violence classes. I gotta get a job.”

Paul clenches his hands together and grits his 
teeth. He has none of Steven’s coolness, perhaps be­
cause he has been in and out of prison less often than 
the older man. 

“I got anxiety bad,” he says. “I been planning this 
shit for two months and I don’t know what the fuck 
to do with myself. My heart’s racing, man.”

Steven laughs. Paul doesn’t. 

Paul’s biggest concern is that he won’t be able to 
land a job. He is required to attend a domestic vio­
lence class once a week and meet with his probation 
officer three times a month, which he believes could 
make him miss work seven times a month. He does 
not know how he will afford child support.  

Paul stands up from the McDonald’s booth and 
looks out the window. The woman who is picking 
him up has pulled into the parking lot. He sits back 
down and repacks his bag. 

“I’m shittin’ my pants, man,” Paul says to Steven 
and me. “I’m thinking of leaving the state. I wanna 
go to New Mexico. I been there once. It’s beautiful.”

Going to New Mexico without permission would 
be a violation of Paul’s probation, which could lead to 
a five-year prison sentence. 

Steven chuckles as Paul walks to the door to meet 
a young woman, whom he greets with a “My girl!” 
They embrace, and Paul follows the woman to her car. 

A man walks over to where Steven and I are sit­
ting and offers him a cigarette. Steven takes it. He bor­
rows the man’s lighter to walk outside and smoke. 

Steven hasn’t had a cigarette in eight months. He 
takes a slow drag and blows smoke toward Whalley 
Jail across the avenue. 

He remains calm as he speaks of reentry, though 
he cannot know exactly where he’s headed. “It’s scary 
when you come out,” he says. “You feel like you lost 
everything. There’s obstacles, but I think positive. You 
can’t let things overwhelm you. That kid, he was get­
ting overwhelmed. You just gotta wait it out. Like my 
mother always said, ‘You don’t get things overnight, 
and when you do you don’t appreciate them.’ When I 
get something I wanna appreciate it.”

I thank Steven for speaking with me. He nods. 
I leave him standing outside the McDonald’s. The 
morning is still cold and raw. He cups the cigarette in 
the palm of his hand, out of the wind.
