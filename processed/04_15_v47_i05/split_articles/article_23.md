movement,” Muzzle Front’s website explains. “Better 
to discover it in the dojo, than in some back alley 
with Pookie the Crackhead.”

Some of the people interested in his courses harbor fears that Higgins considers extreme. He doesn’t 
cater to such people, whom he describes as “on the 
brink of paranoia,” but rather to those who have 
what he considers legitimate concerns and reasonable plans to address them. Sitting in Blue State Coffee 
on Wall Street, he tells of his encounters with people 
on the fringe. Higgins once went to a meeting of the 
Connecticut State Militia, a group that prepares to 
fight back in the event of a government attack on the 
American people. Their Facebook group is closed but 
offers a description that includes the emphatic claim 
that “THIS IS AMERICA, NOT RUSSIA, NOT CUBA, 
NOT CHINA AND SURE AS HELL ISNT NAZI GER­
MANY!!!!”

When he arrived, Higgins found a group of people who represented the sect of preppers from which 
he distances himself. 
“I said to them, ‘You look like a bunch of white 
supremacists, you look like you’re ready to attack the 
world, and you look like a bunch of middle-to-old-
aged white guys,’” Higgins says. “I offered to help 
steer them in the right direction, and leadership decided that they didn’t need that help. They were an 
interesting group of individuals.”

As Higgins explains the underground landscape 
of Connecticut’s radicals, a man near us in Blue State 
seems to be tilting his head in to listen. 
“It’s not polite to eavesdrop,” Higgins rebukes him.

I don’t blame the man for listening. I, too, find it 
hard to understand how someone could see America 
on the road to becoming a new Third Reich. 

Higgins views this extremism as a predictable 
outcome of the way we consume news and information today. Dark rumors spread rapidly across computer screens and televisions. When Frank says he believes 
today’s America faces a uniquely volatile economic 
and international relations landscape, referencing the 
crisis in Crimea, quantitative easing, ISIS, and cyber 
attacks, it’s hard to tell if we actually face more threats, 
or if we are simply more aware of them. Perhaps the 
past is appealing because back then we were less cognizant of danger. 


The members of CRRT draw a sharp line between 
themselves and extremists. The CRRT doesn’t obsess 
over government plots like the Connecticut Militia. 
Frank, who owns a pistol for self-defense and a rifle 
for hunting, seems to enjoy preparing for disasters in 
the same way other people enjoy crafting or training 
for triathlons. But when I ask how he spells his last 
name, he hesitates. He worried about giving away too 
many identifying details. 
“We talk about this thing called op-sec, operational security,” he explains. “If something was to hit 
the fan, they would know where to get my supplies.”


Though the Internet plays a crucial role in connecting preparedness-minded Americans, the mission of the CRRT is to build community in person. In 
addition to the medical training class, the group has 
participated in hikes, a cold-weather pistol technique 
class, and overnight camping trips. Provost’s cousin, 
Adam Hummel, believes that what makes CRRT special is its rejection of the isolation instinct that leads 
preppers to hoard knowledge and resources. He recently posted a message encouraging members to 
ask each other for help with spring cleaning projects 
and renovations.

Provost sometimes gets into virtual arguments, 
defending cooperation within families and communities as key to survival. In response to preppers 
who insist that, come the Big One, they will barricade themselves inside their homes with their weapons and stockpiled food, Provost always poses the 
same question:
“What happens when I come burn your 
house down?” he asks.  “You have to come out 
of the house.”

Provost’s disdain for aggressive individualism 
is a far cry from the blunt self-interest prevalent on 
other prepper forums. Alex Kingsbury, a self-described moderate prepper I met on the Connecticut 
forum of the American Prepper Network site, said he 
doubted many people would want to be interviewed 
because they fear compromising their identity, 
location and supplies. 
“I don’t know you, but I think it’s probably pretty unlikely that you’ll show up at my house with a 
gun to steal my beans,” Kingsbury says.

Given their emphasis on amassing supplies and 
equipment, catering to preppers is big business 
across the country. Companies offer everything from 
fairly standard camping supplies to vast quantities 
of dehydrated food to ready-to-use nuclear bunkers.
“There’s a whole industry out there,” Hummel says.

Hummel, who serves as the group’s IT specialist, 
established a program on Amazon that allows equipment vendors to sell their products to his members at discounted prices. Sitting at his office desk, 
he pulls up the group’s Amazon page and lists off 
items members have bought: water bottle holders, 
fishing kits, emergency blankets, and a physician’s 
desk reference. 

Within this community, as in many American 
communities, the act of consumption bonds people together. The CRRT members in Provost’s living 
room ooh and aah at the disaster gear Wyman shows 
off the way I imagine Greenwich matriarchs admire 
expensive clothing at trunk shows. 

Some companies marketed to preppers focus 
on a particular genre of disaster. Based in Gonzales, 
Texas, a company called Ki4u.com sells items to help 
people survive nuclear disaster. An $815 “Radiation 
“WE’RE NOT A MILITIA, WE’RE 
NOT SURVIVALIST, WE’RE NOT 
PREPPERS. WE GO ABOUT 
OUR NORMAL LIVES AND WE 
PREPARE TO TAKE ACTION IN 
BAD SITUATIONS.”

Safety Combo Package” includes radiation detection 
devices, KI tablets and facemasks to minimize contamination, as well as several books and pamphlets 
produced by the company. One is entitled “The Good 
News About Nuclear Destruction!” 

Other companies profit by selling “situational awareness,” according to Stephen Austakalnis, who founded 
AlertsUSA in the aftermath of September 11 to help people access immediate information about threats emanating from all over the globe. His team of six spends all 
day monitoring news outlets around the world. When 
they notice a potentially troubling development—say, the 
murder of a Mexican politician by a drug cartel or an announcement that American troops will be sent to battle 
Ebola in West Africa—they send an alert to twenty thousand subscribers. The subscription is ninety-nine dollars 
per year.

The American Preppers Network offers users the opportunity to become “Gold Members.” For sixty dollars 
annually, the Gold Member gains access to an exclusive 
newsletter, special discounts at shops that offer survival 
food and supplies, and a private Facebook page to connect with others similarly dedicated to surviving disaster. 
For five hundred dollars, one can obtain “Platinum Lifetime Membership” and receive these benefits for life.

In Connecticut, the Old Saybrook storefront of 
Harris Outdoors began as an Amazon vendor account. 
Bob Harris, the owner, bought and resold outdoor 
supplies he considered high quality, and soon local 
customers were filling his driveway, eager to pick up 
equipment instead of paying for shipping. Now, he 
does almost all his sales out of the shop he opened 
three years ago and recently doubled in size. He sees 
about twenty to thirty customers a week, estimating 
that at least half are preppers.
“Our more reliable customers seem to be a fairly 
tight-knit community,” Harris tells me over the phone. 
“As far as our success story, the biggest thing has been 
word of mouth.”

Harris considers himself a “common-sense prepper.” He stocks his home with extra food and practices 
his outdoor survival skills through backpacking trips.
