EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
I follow the two men who turned left out of the 
gate. I find them sitting in a booth at the McDonald’s 
across Whalley Avenue.
“How you guys doing?” I ask
“Doin’ good man.”
“Better than yesterday.”
The man in blue jeans who asked me for ciga­
rettes outside the jail gate tells me his name is Steven. 
The correctional officer at the sally port gave him the 
jeans, left behind by another inmate. He wears them 
in place of the tans he arrived in. His off-white, long-
sleeved T-shirt and white sneakers are his from before 
his stint inside. 
His salt-and-pepper hair is buzz cut, and his 
clean-shaven cheeks are nicked with small scars. He 
has a wheezy laugh and a wry smile that curls up on 
one side of his mouth. He is 49 years old.
Paul, the other man, is muscular, with a hand­
some, chiseled face and short brown hair. He takes 
off his checkered flannel shirt (also given to him at 
the sally port) to reveal a blue Catholic cross tattooed 
along the side of his right bicep. He is 34. He wears 
black-and-white canvas “skippies,” like the ones left 
on the sidewalk, and he tells me his feet are still freez­
ing from the cold walk.
Paul picks up the flannel shirt and walks over to a 
table where an old man in a raggedy winter jacket sits 
watching television. He drapes the shirt over the back 
of the man’s chair and comes back to our booth. 
“He needs it more than I do,” Paul says, gestur­
ing with his thumb to the man, who has put the shirt 
on his lap. 
“Damn straight,” Steven replies.
Paul pulls on a gray sweatshirt with “NHCC” writ­
ten under the collar in black block letters. He hunches 
over, his elbows on the table. He drums his fingers and 
taps his feet, before opening up his crinkled brown 
bag. Paul spreads some of the letters, notebooks, pa­
perwork, and pamphlets he collected while in prison 
out on the table. He fiddles with a folder labeled “Re­
entry and Transitions.” Steven sets his bag on the table 
but leaves it rolled up.
Steven has just done eight months in the Cor­
rigan-Radgowski Correctional Center, a combined 
level three and four high-security prison in Uncas­
ville, where he served time for a domestic violence 
charge after he threatened his wife—in his case, a 
Class A misdemeanor. He was originally sentenced to 
nine months, but he was released one month early for 
good behavior. He now has two years of probation. 
Paul was charged with domestic violence for 
threatening his ex-girlfriend. He spent three months 
of his six-month sentence in Radgowski before trans­
ferring to a lower-security section of Niantic Annex, 
where he completed his time. He, too, will be on pro­
bation for two years.
Neither of the men is from New Haven, but they 
chose to be dropped off at Whalley Jail because it 
is the facility closest to their homes. Steven is from 
Meriden, Paul from Northford. Steven’s sister should 
arrive at 8:30 a.m., so he has an hour-and-a-half to 
kill. Paul uses my phone to call his girlfriend, due to 
arrive any minute. 
“It always feels weird to be coming outta there 
into society,” Steven says. “We don’t even got normal 
clothes to wear, so people can spot us easy and tell 
where we come from. Feels like people are looking at 
us like we’re crazy. But really they don’t know.”
He smiles and looks at me as though I and every­
one else in the McDonald’s are missing an inside joke. 
Steven has spent fifteen years of his life behind bars 
for various charges. He was out for four years before 
his most recent bid. When I ask him how it feels to be 
out this time, he shrugs.
“When you’re outta society for so long it just 
seems like a different world. I mean, I’m just dying to 
see a twenty-dollar bill. Just the simplest things in life 
are big right now,” he says.
The men speak with bitterness about the prison 
conditions they just left, focusing on the difficulty of 
living without privacy. 
“Niantic Annex is a fuckin’ nightmare. It’s level 
two security, so you think it’s supposed to be better, 
but it’s fuckin’ terrible,” Paul says. 
He tells me that sixty men slept in the bunks on 
either side of him. 
“They’d roll over in their sleep and knock me 
in the head,” he continues. “There’s nowhere to go. 
You’re trapped in this little room with no air. You ei­
ther sit on your bunk or you sit next to your bunk. 
For months. There’s no movement. You’re depressed 
’cause you can’t even walk.”
The men focus on the small details of daily life: 
the uncomfortable sleep, the cold food, the placement 
of the toilets.
“I was in a room with fourteen people,” Steven 
says of the Corrigan-Radgowski Correctional Center. 
“Living shoulder to shoulder. All of us using one bath­
room. They don’t give you no supplies neither. When 
you get in they give you a little piece of soap”—he 
measures a two-inch bar of soap with his fingers—
“and the state deodorant, which is like water. When 
you go to the counselor to ask for something, they say 
they don’t have nothing. Tell you to bum it off of one 
of the other inmates.”
Steven tells me there is no hot water allowed in 
the cells, as hot water can be used as a weapon. To 
heat food from the commissary, inmates improvise 
by making a “stinger.” You take an extension cord 
and cut it open with a pair of nail-clippers, he ex­
plains. You pull out the exposed wires, the neutral and 
the hot, and put a plastic spoon between them. The 
wires can’t touch. You wrap a scrap of metal around 
the spoon and wires, stick the end in a tub of water, 
and plug in the cord. It’s essentially a dead short cir­
cuit. Then you wrap your food in a garbage bag and 
put it in to warm.
Steven and Paul agree, though, that in many ways 
reentry is much more intimidating than prison. 
“When we come out, it’s not over,” Steven says. 


“This is the bad part. Jail’s easy. Inside you got no re­
sponsibility. You get up, you eat, you shit, you take a 
shower, you go back to sleep. They tell you when to 
do everything. This is the real life out here. You gotta 
figure out which way to turn.”
Paul nods in agreement. The six-month sentence 
that ended today has been his only time served since a 
five-year stint after he left the Navy in 2002. He shifts 
in his seat and fidgets with his belongings. Whenever 
a car pulls into the parking lot, he hoists himself up 
to peer through the window, asking, “Is that my girl?” 
Joseph Roach, who works as a counselor at Whal­
ley Jail, says that the DOC cannot control the circum­
stances before or after an inmate’s sentence. A soft-
spoken, middle-aged man with round-framed glasses, 
Roach tells me they can only help an inmate while he 
is incarcerated.   
“If you don’t take the time to take advantage of 
[what’s offered] until the last minute desperation, 
you’re gonna struggle. And then you’ll say it was the 
system that messed you up,” he says.  
But there is sometimes a disconnect between the 
perceptions of prison staff and inmates who believe 
the system is set up solely to punish them. Both Steve 
and Paul enrolled in reentry classes to improve their 
chances of getting out on parole, but both were de­
nied. Steven is convinced that the DOC offers the 
classes only to receive funding from the state and 
federal governments. He says his instructor did not 
care whether the inmates participated, only that they 
showed up. Paul relates a similar experience. 
“The classes they offer are ridiculous,” Paul says, 
shaking his head. “It’s a scam. The whole thing in 
there is money.”
Paul says he wrote to the counselor supervisor 
and the reentry counselor at Radgowski asking for 
help finding reentry programs and employment op­
tions after release. In the McDonald’s, he flattens two 
formal request sheets, one for each counselor, out on 
the table and points to their responses under his notes. 
One told him to consult with his probation officer 
after getting out, and the other said that what Paul 
asked for was not under the counselor’s authority. 
It is difficult to ascribe blame in a situation like 
Paul’s without full knowledge of the facts. Just as there 
are prisoners who do not make the effort to engage 
with resources, there are counselors who do not care 
and simply go through the motions of their job. The 
real issue emerges when jaded prisoners stop seeking 
out resources and stumble along without support. 
Paul reaches into his paper bag and pulls 
out a laminated rectangular card, which reads 
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS: DISCHARGE 
RESOURCE CARD.
“They give you this and basically tell you to kick 
rocks,” he says dismissively. “A list of shelters. I’m not 
going to a shelter.”
WHILE SOME PROGRAMS SEND 
REPRESENTATIVES TO SPEAK 
WITH INMATES AND INITIATE 
PERSONALIZED PLANS WITH 
CLIENTS BEFORE RELEASE, MOST 
RELY ON WORD OF MOUTH TO 
DRAW EX-OFFENDERS TO 
THEIR OFFICES. 

I look at the card. It isn’t a list of shelters. It’s a 
list of phone numbers that access a general reen­
try assistance line, housing authority, The Salva­
tion Army, low-income adult medical benefits, food 
stamps, the employment-assistance organization, and 
childcare services. 
New Haven’s city government works to keep 
the formerly incarcerated informed about all avail­
able resources. Project Fresh Start, a reentry service 
the mayor’s office launched in January, assists anyone 
with a criminal record. The program serves as a bridge 
between ex-offenders and specialized resources: so­
ber houses, job training, mental health care provid­
ers, adult education centers, health clinics, the hous­
ing authority, and more. Chance Jackson, one of the 
program’s coordinators, tells me Project Fresh Start 
should be a “mecca” for ex-offenders, with ties to ev­
ery reentry resource in New Haven. 
Around 260 people walk into Project Fresh Start’s 
office at City Hall each month, but lack of awareness 
persists in the larger ex-offender community. Every 
reentry service I spoke to, from Project Fresh Start to 
CT Works to Project MORE (an ex-offender reintegra­
tion organization) to Transitions Clinic—a free health 
clinic for ex-offenders with chronic ailments—told 
me there needs to be more outreach before release, so 
that men in prison have a sense of what options await 
them when they get out and can prepare accordingly. 
While some programs send representatives to 
speak with inmates and initiate personalized plans 
with clients before release, most rely on word of 
mouth to draw ex-offenders to their offices. Jack­
son explained that he often meets people who have 
been out of prison for months and have strug­
gled on the streets before finally connecting with 
Project Fresh Start. 
Jerry Smart, a community health worker at Transi­
tions Clinic, which aims to serve the roughly eighty 
percent of ex-offenders who come out of prison deal­
ing with chronic illness, put it plainly:
“I’d like to see us connect with prisoners at least 
three to six months prior to their coming home, to 
build a rapport with them and come up with an ac­
tion plan,” Smart said. “If you’ve got this dream of 
getting a job and house, and you don’t have no skills 
and no résumé and basically no contacts, how you 
gonna make that work without a support system?” 
Ryan, another ex-offender, had just completed a 
nine-month sentence when we met on the morning 
of his release. He was in an intensive drug rehabilita­
tion program at Carl Robinson Correctional Institu­
tion in Enfield, where he said he spent his days fill­
ing notebooks with plans for the future. He had been 
incarcerated twice for violating his probation through 
drug use, but was determined to stay clean through 
Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous 
meetings. His past incarcerations caused two “false 
starts” with community college, but he planned to en­
roll in Middlesex Community College in Middletown 
as soon as possible. 
“People who get out of jail and say, ‘I don’t know 
what to do or where to go,’ they just didn’t try,” Ryan 
tells me. “Some people do fall through the cracks, and 
sometimes it’s on the DOC, but if you put in a little bit 
of work, they’re gonna help you out.” 
Paul’s and Steven’s greatest advantage, even if they 
deny the help of nonprofits, is that they have families 
waiting for them. The support of relatives can ease the 
transition back to the rhythms of daily life.
