**Title: FINDING ITS CENTER The Yale Center for British Art restores Louis Kahn’s vision**
**Author: Catie Liu**

T
he Yale Center for British Art is a shell of its former 
self. The once-open portico at the entrance has 
been sealed off and replaced by a single small door. 
The lobby is a construction zone draped in blue tarp. 
The museum, closed for renovations this past January, 
will not reopen until spring 2016. As I walk to the 
front desk, I feel I’m interrupting a work in progress. 
Stripped down to its steel frame, the YCBA is ready 
for renewal. The conservation project is the Center’s 
largest refurbishment since 1998. It is a critical up­
grade of the nearly 40-year-old infrastructure, but the 
plan goes beyond routine maintenance. The Center’s 
staff aspires to return to architect Louis I. Kahn’s orig­
inal vision, using blueprints, sketches, and notes from 
the 1974 construction. 

“You’ll have to wear a hardhat,” YCBA Deputy 
Director Constance Clement tells me, “and sign this 
release form.” The chaotic construction site is the cul­
mination of more than a decade of planning by YCBA 
Director Amy Meyers and Clement. We climb the 
stairs to the fourth floor, holding railings wrapped in 
plastic. The Center’s installation team carefully moves 
the art to other floors before the construction pro­
ceeds, attentive to Paul Mellon’s request that works 
of art he donated be housed in the building. Much 
of the building has been torn out—the carpets, the 
linen walls, the insulation, the movable gallery walls, 
down to the tubes that drain condensation from the 
windows. The gruff world of construction has tempo­
rarily taken the place of delicate paintings. 

Daphne Kalomiris, an architect with Knight Archi­
tecture LLC, explains the logistics as we walk through 
the Center. The exterior walls will be stuffed with a 
mineral wool for insulation. The moveable interior 
walls will be raised slightly off the floor, in keeping 
with a 1974 Kahn sketch. 

The level of attention to the smallest functional 
detail is reminiscent of Kahn’s own obsessive care for 
design. “We’ve literally had to get inside of Kahn’s 
mind,” Kalomiris explains. She describes studying ev­
ery scrap of planning that Kahn left behind. His vision 
was grand: a building that would provide the best 
possible viewing experience and still leave spaces for 
study, fulfilling the Center’s educational goals.

In a way, the building is the Center’s greatest work 
of art, a masterpiece whose original materials are part 
of its ethos. As we continue along the fourth floor, 
Clement and Kalomiris lift up a strip of wood from 
the floor to reveal travertine underneath. “It’s less ex­
pensive and less effort to replace travertine tiles than 
to repair them,” Kalomiris gestures to the cracks and 
worn edges, “but our entire mission is to conserve.” 
This notion of conservation extends even to the lay­
out of the galleries and their relationship to the art they 
contain. The 1998 renovation project divided the fourth 
floor’s Long Gallery, but the new renovations will reopen
