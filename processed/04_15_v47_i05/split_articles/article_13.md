Chris Randall spins around to stop a stoop-shouldered elderly woman, moving so quickly that I have to duck his arm. “Hi, Miss, I love your face—may I take your picture?” 


“Sure, where’s it going?” 


“I Love New Haven—it’s a website that celebrates people, places, and things in New Haven, and I want to celebrate you!” 


“Nah, that’s all right.”


Randall shrugs off the rejection. “I always start out thinking, oh, no one’s going to let me do this, no one’s going to want me to take their picture—but you just do it, you just ask anyway, and you end up with a post. The rejection rate is about fifty-fifty.”


His smile drops a little. “Maybe I’m weirding people out by saying, ‘I love your face.’”


Randall, a professional photographer, has made a career out of such enthusiasm. Hard to miss with his blaring bike horn, he first met his I Love New Haven collaborator, Jeffrey Kerekes, near their homes in Wooster Square. He and Kerekes—a psychotherapist and amateur photographer—established the ILNH site in 2012. Since then, five regular photographers have joined the photography team, and ILNH has accrued over eight thousand Facebook followers.


Like Brandon Stanton’s Humans of New York, ILNH often employs a candid plus caption format—except with a universally positive vibe. It has highlighted Boxing in Faith, a nonprofit gym that trains at-risk youth to box, and the Under 91 project, which decorated the underpass below the highway with public art. Yancey Hitt, a student at Wilbur Cross High School, contributed a photo essay on New Haven Reads, the community book bank and tutoring program.


While the oft-T-shirted and gift-mug’d phrase “I Love New York,” is universally recognized, “I Love New Haven” is still catching on. The ILNH site is an evolving project, rather than a viral feel-good phenomenon, or a larger-scale tourism campaign. But Randall dreams big: he wants to radically rebrand the city through a glossy photo makeover. Whether this is grounded in residents’ true feelings about their city is unclear. Who is the “I” in I Love New Haven?


Walking through Yale’s campus, we pass a tall couple. The man has stubble and neon-rimmed glasses, so Randall jumps in. “Hi, I like you guys’ faces, can I take your picture?” The woman just walks away, and the man shakes his head, “Oh no, no, n—”


“C’mon, I’m Chris.”


“I know who you are, I do. I work for Market New Haven, so we repost a lot of your stuff—but no.”


“Why not?”


“Because I’m behind the scenes like you are, man!”


Randall laughs, and after pressing him once more unsuccessfully, turns onto York Street. Stopping a student, he tells her he likes the contrast between her hair and the leaves. “Can I ask you to make a funny face?” She sticks out her tongue and half-closes her eyes. A masterpiece, and Randall’s first “yes.” The fifty-fifty rejection rate had to turn over sometime.


Whenever you see him on the street, Randall is chatting animatedly with strangers, or whirling abruptly to salute a friend half a block away. Kerekes, a 35-year-old with glasses and greying brown hair, is the quieter half of ILNH, the pragmatist to Randall’s dreamer.


Still, Kerekes has been known to step from behind the lens into the public eye. In 2011, frustrated with high taxes, he ran for mayor of New Haven, challenging the eighteen-year incumbent John DeStefano Jr. Kerekes, a newcomer, lost by only ten percent, though DeStefano outspent him by over a half million dollars.


Randall has political experience too: he worked for the New Haven Land Trust and co-chaired Ward 8 from 2003 to 2013. However, he made his name as a photographer by sneaking into Mill River’s defunct and contaminated English Station power plant, ignoring warnings that the site was toxic and that he could be arrested for trespassing.


Together, Randall and Kerekes see ILNH as a way to—in the words of their website—“Promote snapshot
