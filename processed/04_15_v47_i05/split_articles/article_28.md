LISTENING TO AFRICA
Behind the scenes of Yale’s first Africa Salon
E
arly on a Saturday morning in March, I found 
myself surrounded by African artists, speakers, 
and performers in the basement of the Afro-Ameri­
can Cultural Center. We ate Egyptian salad and South 
African banana bread for breakfast, and we didn’t 
talk much. I assumed that the others were nervous, 
like me, and thinking over what they were going 
to say. We were preparing to participate in the Af­
rica Salon, billed as “Yale’s first-ever contemporary 
African arts fest.” 

A month or so before the event, I’d received an 
email from Ifeanyi Awachie, a Woodbridge Fellow 
with the Yale Africa Initiative and the organizer of the 
Salon. She asked me to perform a poem I’d written 
about visiting my father’s country, Nigeria, for the 
first time as a child. I felt nervous when I saw that the 
program listed me as a “Yale artist to watch”: an Afri­
can audience could disagree with my experience, or 
assume that I, an American citizen, was too unfamiliar 
with the continent to voice my opinion. A first-gen­
eration Nigerian American, Awachie assured me that 
my transnational viewpoint was valuable to the Salon, 
which aimed to expose audiences to the perspectives 
of Africans from all over the diaspora.  

Africa Salon is a much-needed step forward in 
Yale’s Africa Initiative, which formed in response to 
President Salovey’s statement in his inaugural address 
to have “a greater focus on Africa.” Awachie became 
involved with the Africa Initiative because she wanted 
the University’s new concentration to be “something 
with soul and content, not an institutional gimmick.” 

Too often, the continent is thought of as static, in 
need of development and with few contributions for 
the Western world. The Salon provided an important 
counterpart to this perspective, exposing the Yale 
community to contemporary art that few Yalies were 
likely to recognize. Visiting artists from Ghana, Nige­
ria, Kenya, South Africa, and the U.S. discussed their 
work—literature, visual arts, and music—alongside 
Yale’s a cappella group Asempa!, the dance group Dza­
na, and African student photographers and writers.

The Salon added to an ongoing conversation 
among African students at Yale. Comprising just over 
one percent of Yale’s student population, many feel 
like they are forced to become the sole voice and im­
age of the continent’s many countries. Opelo Matome, 
a freshman from Botswana, said that in classes, “I’m 
called upon to speak as an African student—not repre­
sentative of just my country, but the whole continent.” 

But the visitors at the Africa Salon could all comment 
on their complicated relationship with the West, add­
ing nuance to the conversation.

At times, debate turned into disagreement: when 
Nigerian journalist Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani asserted 
that African authors had to publish off the continent 
in order to be really successful, Nigerian publisher 
Bibi Bakare-Yusuf arched her eyebrows. She glanced 
at the audience, inviting them to share in her shock 
and disbelief. When Bakare-Yusuf finally spoke, she 
pushed back against misconceptions. She addressed 
three points neatly and rapidly: yes, African publish­
ers were capable of producing manuscripts without 
typos, yes, there was literary work emerging outside 
of the U.S. and Europe, and no, she did not consider 
herself to be an idealist. This connected to the Salon’s 
project to “rebrand Africa,” as Awachie said, by pre­
senting African art to Americans not because the art­
ists needed Western validation, but because Americans 
need to be better informed.

Nodumo Ncomazi, a Zimbabwean sophomore 
who sat behind me, periodically snapped her fingers 
to indicate agreement with the panelists, or groaned 
loudly to voice her dissent. Later, Nodumo told me 
that she felt that as an African student, she was con­
stantly observing white American culture. At the 
Salon, she felt that she was finally being observed, 
her culture considered valuable enough to warrant 
outsiders’ attention. 

But how can the students at Yale carry on the 
discussions started at Africa Salon? Yale has created 
the Young African Scholars Program to recruit more 
African students, since they now make up only one 
percent of the student body. YYAS prioritizes teaching 
in remote areas of the continent, free of charge. The 
program’s project manager, Helinna Ayalew, networks 
with Yale affiliates in Africa to ensure that students 
from low-income areas hear about the program, al­
lowing for a more diverse population of international 
students at Yale. Ayalew, who received her doctorate 
in African Studies last year, helped organize the first 
YYAS program in her home country of Ethiopia in the 
summer of 2014. “There are so many students who 
would be great at a school like this, but who have no 
idea how to begin the application process,” she said. 
“Going to college in the U.S. would be like going to 
the moon.”  

Rachel Adams, Yale’s associate director for Africa, 
lauds YYAS as one of the most effective steps Yale has 
taken in outreach to Africa. As a native of Zimbabwe 
who did not attend a privileged school, she uses her 
personal network to help recruit students. She’s proud 
of the progress the Africa Initiative has made—the 
class of 2018 has the highest enrollment of African 
international students to date. 

But the Africa Salon showed that even a few stu­
dents can start a conversation. At the concert, the 
manager of a musical guest called Awachie onstage, 
presented her with a Maasai cloth—a bright, striped 
purple blanket—and tied it around her shoulders. 
“Every superwoman needs a super cape,” the manager 
said. Awachie replied with modest relief: “It’s like it 
was another version of me that did all this,” she said. 

I delivered my piece, forgot a couple of insignifi­
cant lines and stuttered once. The audience applauded 
politely. I was still unsure whether I deserved to be at 
an event celebrating contemporary Africa and all its 
complexities. Admittedly, I’ve only been to the conti­
nent four times. I worried that I sounded naïve and, 
by depicting Nigeria through a child’s eyes, roman­
ticized it in some way. I wrote about hearing Yoruba 
for the first time and thinking it was a song-language. 
But the poem was a sincere account of my experience:

Later my cousins will interlace their fingers 
with mine and compare, saying
Chocolate and cinnamon 
Copper and coconut shell 
Even though I have grown dark here
and I can walk with my father and no one asks him
where he got me—
this is not my home but I know that it is his
I hear him speak this tonal language and his tongue 
does not twist around last 
names, has no lilt, does not curl back on itself when it
knows it has mispronounced 
and betrayed its employer 
and for the first time his speech hides nothing.

My Nigerian friend Fadeke and I talked after the 
Salon, and we decided we were considering African 
art the same way some people consider charity: if 
it’s not on your mind at least some of the time, it 
should weigh on your conscience. We felt guilty for 
not thinking of these African conversations more of­
ten. To comfort each other, we said: it’s not all serious. 
African students, myself included, so often complain 
about Yale parties—no one dances! Why isn’t anyone 
dancing? But Battell Chapel was nearly full when the 
Kenyan funk group Just a Band came onstage, and 
during the performance of U.S.-South African rapper 
Jean Grae, most of the audience went to the front of 
the concert hall to dance. Here, at Yale, they gave us 
clips of so many sounds that are missing, so many 
voices that are waiting to be heard.
