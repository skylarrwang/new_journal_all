condition Jesus action figure in his basement office 
across the hall. A look at his website suggests he wears 
mostly cargo (sometimes camo-cargo) pants and 
muscle tees. His current research is primarily on ex­
tant primate ecology and behavior—“monkey busi­ness,” quite literally. But he’s very serious about the 
sacredness of this corpse, this human being, which 
the lab purchased several years ago as an anatomi­
cal teaching tool for classes like “Human Functional 
Anatomy” and “Mammology.” “I’m going to trust that 
you’re a good person,” he says before unlocking the 
laboratory door. Now I’m stuck between a shameful 
instinct to roll in the grossness of it all (“SKIN CELLS! 
SKIN CELLS!”) and the keen sense that I’ll be struck 
by lightning (or a flying mint-condition Jesus action 
figure) at any moment. 

The man on the table has been plastinated; he has 
undergone a mummification of sorts. His body has 
been pumped with formalin to halt tissue decay, cut 
free of skin and connective tissues, dissolved of fat 
and water in an acetone bath, and, finally, stuck in a 
vacuum. Silicone rubber has replaced the water and 
fat formerly in his tissues and organs.

The 1,500-hour, $50,000 plastination procedure 
was first patented in 1977 by Dr. Gunther von Hagens, 
who has since gained infamy—and the nickname 
“Dr. Death”—for serving as the director of the inter­
national travelling corpse exhibition “Body Worlds.” 
Beyond a basic conservative revulsion, critics of von 
Hagen cite transgressions including a 2009 exhibit 
in Berlin’s Postbahnhof featuring children, dead em­
bryos, and—positioned in coitus—the bodies of two 
people who never knew each other in life. 

The body on this table comes from a “cost-for-
service” plastination lab at the University of Michigan 
Medical School, which opened after Hagens’s patent 
expired in 1989. For almost twenty-five years, the 
lab—one of the only plastination labs in the coun­
try—rendered ten to twenty donated cadavers each 
year into dry, odorless, three-dimensional models for 
anatomy education. In July 2014, it closed for reasons 
not publicized. 

Looking to the man on the table, I worry that he 
gave his body to science to escape the grossness of 
decay. Now, sections of his corpse have been dissected 
to different depths, in a sort of violent capitalization 
of his deadness. A visceral cut to the left cheek ex­
poses root-like nerve tangles. The left arm is a meaty 
hunk of fibrous muscle. A horseshoe-shaped flap in 
the chest has been sawed with a serrated blade and 
sits folded over his groin like an apron. The flap is 
topped with yellow fatty tissue and plastic-bag intes­
tines that add new color and texture to a brown body 
that is alternatingly wax paper and string and splin­
tered wood and cave rock and packing paper and rope 
and burnt poultry. And in an act of insufficient mod­
esty, the flesh apron covering the groin interrupts a 
thigh-bones-connected-to-the-hip-bone rhythm that 
could otherwise lead a person from this man’s toe­
nails (still attached, still dead), up the tendons of his 
feet, past a metal shin plate (“Property of Yale Uni­
versity Equipment #170463”) and all the way up to 
his face. Which is also in layers. One eye is closed and 
lined with a thin fuzz of short white lashes, and the 
other socket has been intricately excavated around an 
epicenter of macabreness: a shriveled eyeball. 

Then there are the pieces that have been cut away 
entirely, and sit on the white sheet to the corpse’s side. 
A lung. The heart. Half a kidney. Half a skull. The skull 
is cut at the brow line, its outside covered in peach 
fuzz and its inside cream-colored. A small cardboard 
box sits at the corpse’s feet. The box reads, “THIS SIDE 
UP.” His brain is in there, sitting on a paper towel. 

It occurs to me that I could carry this box of brain 
across the room. I could put the brain on a gradu­
ation cap that Dr. Aronsen has positioned atop a steer 
skull, and I could place the kidney half inside a binder 
on Formaldehyde Spill Protocol. The skull bowl could 
go in the sink like a dirty dish, and the heart on one 
of the paper plates sitting above the cadaver cabinet. I 
could unpack the man and carry all the little pieces 
to corners of this lab—sprinkle the room with his 
crumbs. He’d grow vast with invisible tendons, until 
everything in the room was within him and between 
him. He’d be everywhere. A landscape. He’d take up 
the whole room, and he’d never even know.
He already does.
