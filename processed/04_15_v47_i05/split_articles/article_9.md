A
t the beginning of every semester, Yale Law 
School professor Ian Ayres stands at the front of 
the classroom and opens his wallet. He pulls out crisp 
bills and hands them out, one by one, to the pass­
ing law students. The students walk out not only with 
their casebooks, but also with ten dollars from the 
author himself.

In a 2005 New York Times opinion article titled 
“Just What the Professor Ordered,” Ayres sparked a 
national debate when he wrote, “Professors’ incen­
tives in choosing textbooks are in some ways more 
distorted than doctors’ incentives in choosing drugs.” 
On average, course book authors receive ten percent 
of the cover price in royalties for each book sold. Ayres 
argued that they could abuse their freedom to assign 
reading for financial gain.

Ayres finds this freedom particularly alarming given 
soaring textbook prices. In 2013, the National Associa­
tion of College Stores, a campus retail group, estimated 
the cost of one new textbook to be seventy-nine dollars, 
bringing the average cost of a student’s required course 
materials to over six hundred dollars per semester.

The American Association of University Profes­
sors delegates responsibility to individual universities 
to regulate this ethical quandary. Professors at Virgin­
ia State, the University of Minnesota, and Southern 
Utah University, for example, must have their syllabi 
screened by committees for potential conflicts of in­
terest. After a November 2014 article published in 
the University of Buffalo’s newspaper, The Spectrum, 
exposed professors who assign their own books for 
profit, the university’s Faculty Senate instated a com­
mittee to draft a policy addressing the matter. 
Yale, however, does not monitor the texts profes­
sors assign. When I scoured the new Faculty Standards 
of Conduct draft, I found no mention of the topic. 
When I wrote Stephanie Spangler, head of the Ad Hoc 
Committee on Faculty Standards of Conduct, she con­
firmed its absence and directed me to the University’s 
policy on conflicts of interest, where, again, there was 
no explicit reference to assigning textbooks.

Regardless, some Yale professors have heard 
Ayres’s clarion call. Journalism professor Steven Brill 
promised to give his students a check if they pur­
chased his book, America’s Bitter Pill, at the end of 
this past semester. Music professor Craig Wright puts 
a picture of a ten-dollar bill on the last slide of his pre­
sentations, prompting students to come forward and 


“retrieve the money that is rightly theirs.” But most 
Yale educators are reluctant to make such refunds.

I walk into American Studies professor Matthew 
Jacobson’s office to discuss one of twelve required 
texts on his “Formations of Modern American Cul­
ture” syllabus, What Have They Built You to Do, a book 
about Cold War America and the film The Manchurian 
Candidate. My questions, however, aren’t about Mc­
Carthyism or communist ideology. Instead, they are 
about present-day capitalism. The book, co-written 
by Jacobson, costs $1.04 on Amazon for a used copy, 
$10.87 for a Kindle edition, and $17.96 for a new pa­
perback. “None of us are in it for the money,” Jacob­
son tells me, “People don’t even think of it as income. 
I can show you stubs from royalty checks that are, 
like, forty dollars.”

Professor Robyn Creswell assigns his own edition 
of That Smell and Notes from Prison for the course 
“Politics and Literature of the Middle East.” He, too, 
responds to my questions with a shrug. As a translator, 
his royalties are only one to two percent of the cover 
price, and only when the book is purchased new. Ja­
cobson hasn’t negotiated for Kindle profits, and pro­
fessor David Blight says he makes no royalties off A 
Slave No More “for complicated contractual reasons.”

I’ve been at Yale for four semesters and I’ve been 
assigned five books written by my professors, on ev­
erything from environmental law to poetry. I haven’t 
asked any professors for a refund. But inspired by 
Ayres’s insistence, I shyly ask professor Creswell 
whether he’d consider handing out cash if the profits 
were greater. “Maybe I would take students out for 
doughnuts,” he says.

As I speak to professor Ayres on the phone, I 
pace back and forth in Sterling’s nave, watching stu­
dents thumb through thousands of dollars worth of 
readings. I’ve started viewing the books as their re­
ceipts, but Ayres snaps me out of it, reminding me 
that books, above all, are meant to teach students. 
“I’m hired to transmit ideas I think are of value,” 
Ayres says. “Assigning a book you’ve written allows 
you to more officially profess ideas you created and 
believe in passionately.”

But there’s an inherent conflict of interest here, 
too. CAN—OR WILL—STUDENTS OBJECTIVELY 
DISCUSS AND CRITIQUE 
THE AUTHOR’S 
ARGUMENT WHEN 
THEIR GRADE DEPENDS 
ON THEIR RELATIONSHIP 
WITH SAID AUTHOR?

When professor Creswell asks my class what we 
think of his translation, we compliment the rawness of 
the language, the shortness of the sentences. We don’t 
find anything to criticize. But, Creswell says, “students 
certainly have to be made to feel that they are inter­
locutors,” empowered to participate and respond.  

To that end, Jacobson asks his graduate students 
to write critical responses to the readings he assigns, 
including his own. “If they promise to be respectful, 
I promise not to be defensive,” he chuckles. Similarly, 
Brill assigns the forty-page article upon which Amer­
ica’s Bitter Pill was based, providing students with 
thick stacks of the photocopied pages. “I told them 
to find something badly sourced or badly written,” 
he says.  

Some professors circumvent the question of text­
book profits by allocating them to a charity related to 
their field. John Grim, who teaches courses on reli­
gion and ecology, donates to Native American groups. 
George Chauncey, the instructor of “U.S. Lesbian and 
Gay History,” donates to groups advocating for LB­
GTQ rights and researching AIDS. 

But Ayres still implores Yale professors to consider 
returning the proceeds to the students who are there 
to learn. “I call upon students to ask their professors 
to join me in disgorging the profits,” he proclaims. 
“Rather than there being a law, let’s start modestly by 
just politely asking.” Nowadays, he prefers to let his 
administrative assistant handle this “disgorgement,” 
as he calls it. Handing out cash himself has come to 
seem too dramatic, he says. And besides, he doesn’t 
always have exact change.
