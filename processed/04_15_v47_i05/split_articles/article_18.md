snowy grounds on their phones, and I could hear 
their laughter as I approached.  
“This death and dying class is not something 
I’m into,” Tina told me, shaking her head. She’s 
become increasingly uncomfortable over the 
course of the semester, she said. “I don’t think 
you’re ever prepared to die.” I told them about 
the app and opened the home page. They raised 
their eyebrows, but Tina seemed to get it. “On­
line has become the physical for a lot of peo­
ple,” she said, shrugging her shoulders. “It’s like 
when you go into a wake and see pictures framed 
on a table.” 

Shironda’s grandmother died three weeks be­
fore that day, and her family had just brought home 
the cremated remains. As we walked to her car, she 
talked about the process of accepting the loss. She 
would never use something like the Evergreen app, 
“but today answered a lot of questions,” she told 
me, getting into the driver’s seat. She headed back 
to school to finish class as the snow fell.

Driving down the Evergreen asphalt, Shironda 
reminded me of something important: she, along 
with Fiore, Lindemann, her classmates, and I, can 
leave the cemetery at any time. For the thousands 
lying still beneath the grass, though, the app might 
be the only to way to do that, to transcend a carved 
stone and fading memories. As family members 
create online resting places more personal than 
small plots of land, the “cemetery for the living” 
can extend beyond the fences of Evergreen. That’s 
good business for Fiore. But for someone like me, 
the user, meeting these people for the first time on 
the app, scrolling through profiles feels like peer­
ing into a private museum.
