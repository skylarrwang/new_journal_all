T
he walk to New Haven’s Evergreen Cemetery pre­
pares you for where you’re going. Yale New Ha­
ven Hospital, a nursing facility, and the Jewish Home 
for the Aged line Davenport Avenue leading up to 
the wrought iron gates. “RIP” is written in Sharpie 
on metal lampposts surrounding the grounds. Once, 
I saw the leathery face of a butchered pig lying 
in the street. 

But on a Sunday morning, as I passed through 
Evergreen’s brick entrance, the words “Hello and 
Welcome…” appeared on my phone over a picture of 
bright, blossoming trees and well-kept grass. Tomb­
stones—some as small as shoeboxes, some towering 
and ornate—catch the sunlight at the bottom of the 
photo. The scene is the homepage for the Evergreen 
Cemetery app, released last year by webCemeteries.
com. When it came out, Evergreen’s newsletter, The 
Bough, declared, “We are on the cutting edge of the 
Cemetery industry.” 

The app isn’t exactly Facebook for the dead, but 
it’s the closest thing. After opening the app, a user 
is offered three options: “Search,” “Nearby,” and 
“Tours,” all in modern, inviting sans serif. If you’re 
on Evergreen’s grounds, a tour places you on a satel­
lite map of the cemetery as a pulsing grey dot. Blue 
markers appear on the screen around you, pointing 
out themed collections of graves. “The Ladies of Ev­
ergreen” tour highlights tombstones with female 
statues, many with faces turned down or covered 
by a stone hand. The “Governors and Lt. Governors 
Tour” is, expectedly, pretty straightforward. 

Much of the tech experience is far removed 
from Evergreen’s gravel paths. Within days of a new 
burial, webCemeteries.com creates a profile of the 
deceased on the app and Evergreen website. Relatives 
can post photos, obituaries, life stories, and memo­
ries online. The most decorated profiles are those of 
historical figures, such as Edward Bouchet, Yale’s first 
black graduate, or William Chester Minor, who shot 
a man, entered an insane asylum, and wrote defi­
nitions for the Oxford English Dictionary (in that 
order). A few recent burials have contributions. One 
user, easily the most active, has uploaded eighty-six 
photos and more than forty memory posts on her 
husband’s page since his death in 2013. 

Dale Fiore, who has been the general man­
ager of Evergreen Cemetery since 1986, monitors 
the profiles and authored some of the tours. Fiore 
first encountered the idea for an app after seeing a 
webCemeteries.com demonstration at a trade show. 
Fiore is a loud speaker with a gravelly voice, gestur­
ing with full arms and leaning his broad shoulders 
back in his chair. “We’re a very solid, progressive 
business,” he told me. He has been at the helm of 
the cemetery’s other modernization efforts, set­
ting up a new office location and a mausoleum for 
cremated remains.

The app, his latest project, is part of his idea to 
build a “cemetery for the living.” After interrogating 
the company’s representative about the technology 
(“I really want to kick the tires and make sure things 
work before I invest in them,” he said), he brought 
the app to Evergreen, where all records now sync 
automatically with webCemeteries’ database.

I asked Fiore if having a posthumous online 
presence makes it easier to think about dying. Could 
the “online cemetery” replace the real one? He 
seemed uncomfortable with metaphysical questions. 
“I never really gave it much thought,” he said. “I want 
to make sure that in my time here I do the right 
things for sustaining the cemetery’s future, forever 
and ever.” For now, that means keeping technology 
at an involved but careful distance. “You really can’t 
feel them,” he said of personal memories, “until you 
tangibly go and touch the stone or see your loved 
one’s grave.” 

During a March snowstorm, about twenty 
women came to the cemetery on a field trip for their 
“Death and Dying” class at Albertus Magnus Col­
lege. They gathered in the crematorium in rows of 
folding chairs, and Fiore stood at the front to dis­
cuss the process of cremation before giving a tour 
of the machine. 

Evie Lindemann, the professor, was eager to talk 
about the app, an idea “fraught with difficulties and 
blessings,” she said. “The question I always ask my­
self is, what’s the nature of these connections that 
we’re establishing? I think there’s something about 
the human connection that we’re always all going 
to need.”

The class went outside to sketch tombstones 
(Lindemann has a degree in art therapy). Two of 
the students, Shironda and Tina, held umbrellas and 
wandered among graves on a hill near the cremato­
rium. They took photos of the engraved names and 
I ASKED FIORE IF 
HAVING A POSTHUMOUS 
ONLINE PRESENCE MAKES 
IT EASIER TO THINK 
ABOUT DYING. COULD 
THE “ONLINE CEMETERY” 
REPLACE THE REAL ONE?

UNCOMFORTABLE 
WITH METAPHYSICAL 
QUESTIONS.
