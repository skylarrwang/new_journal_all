bearded men, with black jack­
ets—military 
jackets, 
Shahid 
thought. He watched as they 
shoveled gravel out of the back of 
a white, unmarked van and tossed 
it into the earth, near the duplex’s 
drainage pipe. An assortment of 
children’s toys from the fami­
lies at the duplex—remnants of a 
Cozy Coupe and a pink bicycle, 
half-buried—dotted the back lot, 
which was surrounded by fence. 
Shahid tried not to make eye con­
tact with the men who watched 
him, silently, as he climbed the 
wooden stairs that hugged the 
back of the duplex. He walked 
into his family’s third-floor apart­
ment, where he lived with his par­
ents and five younger siblings. 
By noon the next day, when 
Amila, Shahid’s mom, left the 
house for a doctor’s appointment, 
the men were gone. At the south 
end of the lot, they had left a shad­
owy rectangle of gray gravel, in a 
darker shade than the rest of the 
yard, as if a cloud had floated over 
and stopped at the edge of the 
fence.


When Amila and her husband, 
Navid, first saw the vinyl-sided 
façade of 18 Dewitt Street, they 
thought the property was a step up 
from their first American home. 
The Dewitt Street apartment was 
more affordable––a lean $1,200 
per month––and closer to the 
K-8 school in The Hill that four 
of their six children attended. But 
after signing their lease, a series 
of unpleasant discoveries made 
the property less attractive: mice, 
insects, and raccoons frequently 
scurried across the living room 
floor and into the kids’ bedrooms. 
Outside the room that Shahid 
shared with his brother, a long 
rod of twisted iron swung slightly 
from the top frame of a bay win­
dow. 


Later in March, after living 
there for over a year, the Naqib­
zois learned another fact about 
18 Dewitt Street that had gone 
undisclosed: the property was 
contaminated with toxic levels 
of lead. A city inspection, con­
ducted after a suspected poisoning 
at the property, found the chem­
ical on their windowsills, in the 
dust lying on the stairwell, and, 
in its most concentrated form, in 
the soil surrounding the drainage 
pipe of their house. According 
to the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA), soil with lead con­
centration at 400 parts per million 
or greater is considered so great a 
public health hazard that the lead 
must be removed immediately, 
and children must vacate the res­
idence. The soil surrounding the 
Naqibzois’ home, where children 
used to play, was over three times 
that number.


What Shahid had witnessed that 
day in February was the final step 
of the removal process, called a lead 
abatement: the legally required 
remediation of lead-based hazards 
in a child’s home. When toxic lead 
is present in the ground, the EPA 
says, the contaminated soil must be 
carefully dug up and hauled away. 
Then, a property owner, usually 
dependent on hired maintenance 
contractors, brings a “clean” soil 
deposit to the premises, making 
them safe for small children to 
inhabit. 


Six months earlier, their land­
lord, Shmuel Aizenberg of Ocean 
Management, was ordered by 
the city’s Health Department to 
perform a lead abatement of 18 
Dewitt. Yet city officials were 
aware of the soil contamination as 
early as November 2020, when an 
inspector received lab results that 
confirmed hazardous lead quanti­
ties in the property—and in 2016, 
a city inspection report had found 
similar levels of contamination. 
Eight years before the Naqibzois 
were made aware of it, the proper­
ty’s history of lead poisoning was 
marked in the public record.


For the Naqibzois, informa­
tion about the lead contamination 
came too late. 18 Dewitt Street 
wasn’t their first time as Ocean 
Management tenants—it wasn’t 
even the first Ocean property 
where they had lived with lead 
contamination. The first house 
in America where the Naqibzois 
lived, on Howard Avenue, was 
another one of the hundreds of 
Ocean-owned low-income prop­
erties in New Haven, operated 
under the names of smaller com­
panies. While living there, at age 
2, Shahid’s younger sister tested 
positive for lead poisoning.

THE  NEW  JOURNAL
The Naqibzois were not alone. 
Over the course of this four-
month investigation, I confirmed 
that at least seven refugee families 
in New Haven, including over a 
dozen children, were exposed to 
toxic levels of lead in their homes 
without their knowledge. Emails, 
lab results, and city inspection 
reports from three FOIA requests 
show that city officials and land­
lords neglected to remove toxic 
lead for months from properties in 
New Haven where refugee fami­
lies with young children were liv­
ing.


Refugee families in the United 
States, who are disproportionately 
affected by lead poisoning, have 
little say over the first places where 
they are told to live, and receive 
few federal protections against 
lead exposure during resettle­
ment. Where toxic lead is found, 
children who left homes once 
for safety must leave new homes 
again: after resettlement, a second 
exile.

The Poison 
Lead, the most common indus­
trial contaminant in America, can 
cause significant negative health 
effects for anyone exposed, but 
particularly for children under 
six. At that age, even low levels of 
exposure can permanently damage 
brain development. At extremely 
high levels, lead poisoning can 
lead to seizures, coma, and death. 
“No amount of lead exposure is 
safe,” Erin Nozetz, a Yale pedi­
atrician and the director of New 
Haven’s Lead Task Force, told me. 
Yet the behavior of New Haven 
landlords form a pattern: they 
often fail to remove lead contam­
ination, or alert families about its 
presence in their homes, within 
the time frame required by law. 
Along with city officials, landlords 
often fail to provide translated 
information about the risks to 
families who don’t speak English, 
many of whom are refugees. (One 
reason frequently cited in city 
documents for inspection delays: 
“language barriers.”) None of the 
families that I contacted, with the 
help of Pashto and Dari interpret­
ers, had been promptly informed 
by their landlord of toxic lead lev­
els in their home. In some cases, 
we were the first to inform fami­
lies of lead contamination in their 
current or former homes.


The 
New 
Haven 
Health 
Department’s policy is to inspect 
a house for lead after a child under 
six has already been poisoned. 
So far this year, inspections have 
discovered lead contamination in 
at least 44 properties with young 
children, according to public 
records. The most common cul­
prit is paint: until 1978, when the 
product was banned for residen­
tial use, lead paint was a staple of 
American real estate. According to 
a report by former health director 
Paul Kowalski, 83 percent of New 
Haven’s housing stock was built 
before 1978. The paint is partic­
ularly hazardous when it chips or 
peels, making it easier for a child 
to ingest.


The Centers for Disease Con­
trol and Prevention (CDC) con­
siders children under six “lead 
poisoned” when their blood lead 
levels (BLLs) are 5 micrograms 
per deciliter or above. A recent, 
internally-circulated report from 
the Connecticut Department of 
Public Health shows a staggering 
statistic: while 1.7 percent of Con­
necticut children under six have 
BLLs at that level or higher, 43.7 
percent of refugee children under 
six do—nearly one in two children 
poisoned.


“Refugees and other newcomer 
persons resettled to the U.S.,” the 
CDC says, are a “population at 
higher risk” of lead exposure. One 
explanation for that higher risk is 
children’s prior exposure before 
coming to the United States. 
In Afghanistan, for instance, a 
greater presence of lead-based 
gasoline could signify a greater 
risk to children. Another, in the 
CDC’s phrasing, is exposure to 
risky “cultural practices, tradi­
tional medicines, and consumer 
products”—or as Camille Brown, 
the director of Yale’s Pediatric 
Refugee Clinic, puts it, “behaviors 
of different cultures.”


It’s true that many products 
made abroad, such as metal jew­
elry, spices, or cosmetics, contain 
lead, often because lead is cheap 
and easy to mold. Yet at best, 
reports  from three Connecticut Freedom 
of Information Act requests show that 
city officials and landlords neglected to 
remove toxic lead for months from 
properties in New Haven where refugee 
families with young children were living.

these assumptions of exposure 
abroad provide a partial picture: 
prolonged American exposures to 
lead are a regular occurrence for 
refugee children too. During the 
COVID-19 pandemic, at the lead 
treatment center where Nozetz 
works, families took her on a 
“Zoom walk” through their house, 
and she’d point out potential haz­
ards. Common sources included 
peeling paint, windowsills, and 
stairwells covered in lead dust. If 
refugee children are placed in fur­
ther harm’s way, Brown said, U.S. 
resettlement risks “exacerbating” 
prior exposure.  Children’s BLLs 
should start to decrease after a few 
months in lead-free environments; 
high BLLs after three months 
could signify that they are still 
being exposed. One 2017 study 
suggested that newcomers’ “joint 
exposure”—first, 
to 
lead-based 
products in a country of origin, 
and second, to an older home in 
the United States—was a signifi­
cant driver of higher BLLs. In the 
Connecticut Department of Public 
Health report, “paint/lead dust” is 
listed as refugees’ primary source 
of exposure to lead. Contaminated 
soil is second.


One of the most recent fatalities 
of lead poisoning in the United 
States, in 2002, was a refugee 
child. Sunday Abek, a 2-year-
old girl, died of lead poisoning 
in Manchester, New Hampshire, 
after the landlord of the property 
failed to disclose the presence of 
lead paint in their apartments. 
Sunday’s mother settled a lawsuit 
for $700,000 against the property 
manager and building owner; the 
property manager was also sen­
tenced to fifteen months in federal 
prison. Her lawyer said, “had she 
known the price for coming to 
America would be the life of her 
youngest child…she never would 
have come.”

The First Exile
Amila, a skilled tailor and dress­
maker, met her husband Navid 
Naqibzoi in 2003, in their home­
town of Khost near the Pakistani 
border. He was her next-door 
neighbor, and they married the 
following year. In 2012, Navid 
began to work as a medic on a U.S. 
military base, Forward Operating 
Base Chapman, in Logar Province. 
Everything from simple sutures to 
I.V. drips to EMT calls fell under 
his purview. Navid accompanied 
American soldiers on missions out­
side Chapman, and he was adept at 
making friends. He liked to crack 
the occasional grim joke about the 
American War on the base, which 
endeared him to the others. At 
home, he kept details about Chap­
man to himself. 


Eventually, concerns that the 
Taliban would target Afghans 
working at the base in Khost 
became so extreme that Navid 
warned his family not to venture 
beyond their walled home except 
for emergencies. Each morning, he 
carefully mapped the directions of 
his driving route to Chapman, so 
that he could follow another route 
back home and avoid a tail.


On the advice of a close friend, 
Amila and Navid applied for Spe­
cial Immigrant Visa (SIV) status 
in 2016. For Iraqi and Afghan 
nationals who face persecution as a 
result of working for the U.S. mil­
itary and its affiliates, SIV status is a 
means of protection by relocating: 
applicants who are approved for 
SIV status receive permanent resi­
dency and a green card to move to 
the mainland United States. Suc­
cessful receipt of SIV status, how­
ever, is a notoriously slow, bureau­
cratic process. In 2018, a group of 
Afghan and Iraqi nationals sued 
the U.S. federal government over 
application delays that lasted as 
long as five years, which a federal 
judge later ordered the Trump 
administration to remedy.


After three years of waiting, the 
Naqibzois’ SIV application was 
finally approved. On November 
18, 2019, they boarded a plane, 
for thirty-six hours of flying and 
an eight-hour layover in Dubai. 
Shahid was bored: the novelty of 
his first flight wore off quickly, and 
he wanted to get on the ground. 
In Khost, when he watched the 
World Wrestling Entertainment 
channel, he especially liked Amer­
ican wrestling aficionado Roman 
Reigns, whom other WWE audi­
ences loved to hate. “Even though 
he’s 
the 
World 
Heavyweight 
Champion!” Shahid protested. He 
was anxious to see the country 
Reigns was from, where “they said 
they don’t have war.” 


Upon their arrival in the United 
States, a refugee resettlement case­
worker told the family to move to 
a multi-family unit on Howard 
Avenue, at that point owned by 
an affiliate of Ocean Management. 
Navid searched for a medical job 
in New Haven, but no hospital 
in Connecticut would recognize 
his certificate from Chapman. He 
worked as a delivery driver down­
town, for Uber and DoorDash, 
to make money. He learned the 
addresses of Yale’s residential col­
leges, and grew to appreciate Sil­
liman College residents for their 
reliable late-night Papa John’s 
orders. 


Shahid and his siblings, includ­
ing his younger sister, who goes 
by 'Naz,' underwent a mandated 
“refugee health assessment,” which 
included testing for the children’s 
blood-lead levels, measured in 
micrograms per deciliter. When 
Naz’s results came back from Yale-
New Haven Hospital, a few days 
later: her BLL was nine micro­
