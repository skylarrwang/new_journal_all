“The attic was a fascinating place for me,” reads a 
note atop six panels of navy blue linework drawings. 
In the upper three panels, a young boy digs around an 
old chest, discovering a gun, bullets, a grenade, and 
other military equipment. In the lower three panels, 
another character comes across some clothing, a vial 
of morphine, and a sword. The caption: “Attic discov­
eries—1925 and 2020.”

It seems like what the characters are really discov­
ering is pieces of themselves; we are just not sure 
what. Simone Hasselmo, who uses any pronouns, 
drew these panels as part of one of their first longform 
comic projects in which they explore their grand­
father’s experiences growing up in Nazi Germany, 
alongside their own experiences in medical school. As 
my eyes travel from panel to panel, I am struck by the 
unchanged expressions of innocence on their charac­
ters’ faces as time inevitably passes.

“I don't think I would be doing it if I felt like I had a 
choice,” Simone Hasselmo, a Yale School of Medicine 
student tells me about their passion for zine and comic 
making. For Hasselmo, narrative art is a compulsion—
one that informs and is informed by their passion for 
medicine. Hasselmo’s art combines the clarity and 
precision of comic-style minimalism with the com­
plicated nature of their identity—leaning on humor, 
caricature, and the exploration of familial bonds. But 
narrative art doesn't just contain Hasselmo’s iden­
tity. It informs it, too. They are able to explore their 
own relationships, like that with their grandfather, as 
well as their own queerness and femininity, they tell 
me. Like an attic discovery, zine-making provides a 
medium for Hasselmo to uncover parts of themself, to 
interrogate their identity. But this would not always 
have been possible for someone like Hasselmo.

The modern conceptualization of the zine arose 
first in post-World War I science fiction circles. They 
came to be known as an art form that combined 
images and writings, often self-published and created 
by individuals or a small handful of people. Fans of the 
medium would use them to share literature and ideas 
they were passionate about. In the nineteen-nineties, 
a third-wave feminist movement called Riot Grrrl 
expanded the countercultural significance of the zine, 
and centered it around the experiences of young, 
often lesbian and bisexual women making radically 
feminist punk music. 

Despite how progressive the Riot Grrrl creators 
were, the scene was almost completely dominated 
by cisgender white women. Not only were trans­
gender and BIPOC women denied the same plat­
form and prominence, many of the white, cisgen­
der musicians within the scene continued to remain 
loyal to trans-exclusionary radical feminist causes. 
For instance, artists like Kathleen Hanna of the Riot 
Grrrl band and zine both titled Bikini Kill performed 
at a festival called Michfest, which was marketed as 
only for “womyn born womyn.” Transmisogyny 
and racism existed in the Riot Grrrl community, 
but concurrent movements emerged that were more 
inclusive. Women of color during this time created 
something known as Sista Grrrl Riots, as a rejection 
of Riot Grrrl’s exclusivity. The Riot Grrrl movement 
fell mostly apart only a few years after its inception, 
and zine-making became more and more inclusive as 
it persisted into the twenty-first century. Though still 
far from perfect, there exists a robust zine community 
today, built on collaboration, collectivity, and support 
of each other's art.

For a creator like Hasselmo, whose zines connect 
them to the present, zines are more than just historical 
artifacts. “I’m actually a really private person,” Has­
selmo tells me. “But I somehow just feel the need to 
get my experiences down on paper.” 

Despite being a self-proclaimed private person, 
Hasselmo finds joy and meaning in New Haven’s zine 
and comic arts community. Hasselmo was featured 
recently on February 26 at the New Haven Zine Fair 
at Bradley Street Bicycle Co-Op, organized by Con­
necticunt Magazine and Bridge and Tunnel Crowd. 
The Fair offered space for queer creators, like Has­
selmo, to share their experiences through their art and 
engage with a community that is beginning to reflect 
a more multi-faceted queer experience that includes
