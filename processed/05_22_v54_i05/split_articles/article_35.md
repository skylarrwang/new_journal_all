dergarten while Amila started cut­
ting red linens for her daughter to 
wear on her first days of school. 
In the living room, as his sisters 
turned on a Bollywood movie, I 
talked to Shahid about his weekly 
routine. He attended an IRIS youth 
group after school on Fridays, in 
the church next to Yale’s Timothy 
Dwight College. He would start 
attending again, after Eid. 
Shahid remembered Eid last 
year. It was May 2021, and his 
friends took him to Lighthouse 
Point Park for a barbecue.  The 
boys had hoped for an empty park, 
so that they could dance Attan 
along the boardwalk. Attan is a 
traditional Pashto dance, involving 
left-to-right pivots, careful steps, 
and twisting wrists. “There were 
Americans, and they were taking 
photos of us, they were recording 
us,” Shahid recalled. He didn’t like 
it, at all—the silent gaze of strangers 
made him feel self-conscious. The 
boys preferred to dance unseen, 
going out as late as 3 a.m. in the 
park to do so. 
Shahid guessed the Americans 
“thought we were Arab, or from 
Turkey.”Eventually, 
the 
boys 
asked the onlookers not to post 
any of the photos they took, and 
his friends decided to post their 
own videos of Attan on TikTok, 
to claim the recordings for them­
selves. 
In past years, the park had 
hosted the annual New Haven 
Lead Poisoning Awareness Pic­
nic, the short-lived brainchild of 
former health director Paul Kow­
alski. “We’re trying to keep the 
issue alive,” Kowalski told the 
New Haven Register in 2018. At 
one picnic, Kowalski dismissed the 
lead-related lawsuits against the 
city as “lies and distortions.” The 
fair was discontinued when Kow­
alski resigned, in 2019, after he was 
named in Marx’s class action suit. 
Picnics featured a banner with a 
slogan used in lead awareness cam­
paigns across the country:
LEAD FREE IS BEST FOR ME!
The message is no longer on 
display at Lighthouse Point Park. 
But on the day Shahid visited with 
his friends in 2021, to remind their 
onlookers in the park who they 
were, he hung the tricolor banner 
of Afghanistan from the ceiling 
of the park’s wooden pavilion—
though today, the Taliban’s flag 
flies in Kabul. Wind buffeted the 
flag in the direction of the light­
house, whipping bands of red, 
black, and green toward the sea. 
The boys kept dancing Attan.
