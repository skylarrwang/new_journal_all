I often find myself strolling through the bowels of 
the Schwarzman Center, Bow Wow sushi in hand, in 
search of a quiet place to study. Occasionally, tempted 
by the porthole-like windows on the double doors 
at the base of the rotunda, I bypass the bustling Elm 
and approach the Schwarzman Center’s new bar, The 
Well. Peering inside, I’m beckoned by a scene that’s 
part speakeasy, part corporate waiting room, with 
warm lighting, brass fixtures, and orange armchairs 
galore. On one such sojourn, I mustered the courage 
to attempt to swipe in, only to be thwarted by the 
jarring red beep of the card scanner. Was my intrigue 
insufficient for admission to The Well? It was exclu­
sive. It was strange. I needed to know more.

A few days later, sitting in the Starr Reading 
Room on a spring evening, the magnetic draw of 
The Well—now newly open for business—reached a 
fever pitch. I couldn’t stay away any longer. I shoved 
my laptop into my backpack and trudged across the 
pristine granite of Beinecke Plaza and back into the 
Schwarzman basement. This time was different. I was 
greeted at the door of The Well by a friendly bar­
tender who scanned my ID and wrapped a printed 
band around my wrist, which listed my full name, 
birth date, and driver’s license number. Although the 
white plastic of the wristband made me feel as though 
I had just entered a hospital rather than a bar, I was 
glad to have finally made it in. The bartender surveyed 
the almost-empty room and told me that it could get 
busier, sometimes. When I asked her what it’s like to 
work in The Well, her face lit up: “This is the best job 
in the world: we get to see whatever happens here. 
When the professors start to loosen up a bit and begin 
offering to buy people drinks…” She trailed off but 
quickly caught herself: “of course, nothing scandalous 
happens, but it is interesting.”

        	My intrigue intensified and I approached 
the bar in hopes of loosening up myself. As I perused 
the menu, a few balding men wearing blazers spoke 
in hushed tones on one side of me, while a woman 
laughed loudly with the bartender on the other. I 
ordered a beverage entitled, rather meticulously, 
“American Hard Cider Stormalong Unfiltered Wall­
ingford, CT Blue Hills Orchard EST 1904 Hard 
Cider.” I sipped my drink (which was delicious) and 
plopped down in a chair. As I sat observing the scene, 
lit by a soft golden light, I was struck by the odd­
ness of the space. A few men in their mid-twenties 
wearing khaki pants arrived and awkwardly high-
fived one another before quickly downing a couple of 
beers. Some tattooed graduate students laughed in the 
corner over their glasses of sauvignon blanc. Despite 
being firmly in the heart of Yale’s campus, I felt pro­
foundly uncertain about my surroundings. What was 
this place? Was I the only undergrad present? After 
finishing my drink, I rose and ascended the stairs back 
into the dark, warm night.

Later, in hopes of settling my confusion, I began 
probing whatever authorities I could find on The 
Well. The Schwarzman Center website promises that 
one can “refresh and unwind under the Rotunda… 
[in this] 21+ pub with comfortable seating and a 
curved, two-level bar.” The sparse description left 
me with more questions than answers, primarily: 
why was this place created in the first place? To my 
disappointment, my emails to Schwarzman Center 
employees went deflected or unanswered. I decided 
that my inquiry would require me to traverse through 
the murky depths of the internet, and, beckoned by 
the second yellow ‘O’ in the “Goooooooooogle” at 
the bottom of the page, I forged on.

There, I found a website linking to the designers of 
The Well. I contacted Melissa DelVecchio, of Rob­
ert A.M. Stern Architects, LLP, the head architect for 
the Schwarzman Center project. DelVecchio claimed 
that the idea for The Well came from students, who 
she said requested a place where those of age could 
responsibly consume adult beverages together as part 
of the 2015 report to President Salovey. “[Our team]
