THE  NEW  JOURNAL
Author’s preface: This article is 
the product of a four-month-long 
investigation into how delays in New 
Haven’s lead poisoning prevention 
practices affected families with young 
children in the city, including many 
refugees. I reviewed over two hun­
dred pages of previously unreleased 
government documents related to four 
New Haven addresses, the bulk of 
which were obtained through three 
Connecticut Freedom of Information 
Act (FOIA) requests. This article 
involved dozens of interviews with 
former and resettled refugees, gov­
ernment officials, medical and legal 
academics, employees of IRIS and 
other nonprofits, and property own­
ers. Some names have been changed, 
and some details omitted, to protect 
the locations and identities of inter­
view subjects. 
Before writing this article, I for­
merly worked at Integrated Refugee 
and Immigrant Services (IRIS), one 
of the organizations in this story, as 
a remote intern in 2020-2021. My 
work consisted of filing Section 8 
applications and UI claims during 
the COVID-19 pandemic. I met the 
Naqibzois separately, through sources 
at Elena’s Light, who connected us 
through a mutual friend.
This article could not have beeen 
completed without Elena’s Light, a 
refugee-led organization dedicated 
to women’s and children’s welfare in 
New Haven, that provided Pashto 
and Dari interpreters under contract 
with The New Journal.

Left in the Dark 
Earlier this year, on a cold Feb­
ruary day around 2:30 p.m., Sha­
hid Naqibzoi got off the bus from 
Wilbur Cross High School and 
walked toward his home in The 
Hill neighborhood of New Haven, 
still thinking about favorite class, 
biology. A tall, wiry fifteen-year-
old, Shahid knew he wanted to 
become a doctor, or maybe an 
engineer, with the encourage­
ment of his new teachers. When 
he turned the corner to his back­
yard and saw strange men digging 
outside his family’s yellow duplex, 
he assumed they were “from the 
government.” 
In 
Afghanistan, 
when U.S.-funded infrastructure 
began to crumble during his ado­
lescence, he had seen officials in 
similar attire fix the potholes.
There were four of them,
