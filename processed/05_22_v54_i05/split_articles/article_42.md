Where was it that I first heard the rumors? Was it 
a comment on a drive back from a bike race? A stray 
remark at a holiday party? I struggled to believe that 
one person could be so many things: a Yale professor, 
the architect of Obamacare, and the fastest cyclist in 
New Haven. Looking to separate truth from fiction, I 
set out to find the man.


I had started biking more seriously only during the 
pandemic. Hours of open road and blue skies served 
as a vital escape from the constraints of lockdown 
life. But the risks of the sport always weighed heavily 
upon me. Riding on the shoulders of car-filled roads, I 
thought often about what would happen if one of the 
cars swerved. Perhaps a ride with an expert in health­
care policy could help me figure out if the sport was 
really worth it.


On the same day that Obama visited the White 
House to mark the 12th anniversary of the passage of 
the Affordable Care Act, I met Jacob Hacker, Stan­
ley B. Resor Professor of Political Science, outside his 
East Rock home. I could spot his neon-yellow gloves 
from two blocks away, the only spot of color on his 
otherwise all-black, skin-tight kit. 


In his professional life, Hacker is most known for 
his work on social and public policy. Though he 
didn't create Obamacare, he did generate the idea for 
the public option, a government-created health insur­
ance plan that would have functioned as an afford­
able alternative to options on the private market, 
though it never became law. Elsewhere in his work, 
he has written about how the U.S. government has 
transferred burdens and risks from corporations onto 
individuals and the working class in the post-Reagan 
years of anti-government politics. You might not 
guess it while watching Hacker cycle—in the groups 
he rides with, bikes are worth sums that others would 
not save in months—but concern for lower-income 
citizens permeates his writings. One of his books—
Winner-Take-All-Politics: How Washington Made the 
Rich Richer and Turned Its Back on the Middle Class—
became a New York Times best-seller during the 
Occupy Wall Street protests.


After meeting at his house, we set off for Sleeping 
Giant State Park, a dozen or so miles from Yale’s cam­
pus, and the site of a weekly road ride that is notori­
ously brutal and fast. Hacker insisted he's not the fast­
est cyclist in the city today, but he is one of the fastest. 
I had no hopes of keeping up with Hacker and his 
fellow racers once that ride began. So, as we rode up 
through East Rock and then north out of New Haven 
on our way to meet the group, I worked to get in as 
many questions as I could. More theoretical questions 
about, say, the neoliberal resonances of cycling tights, 
would have to be explored another time.


As our ride progressed, it became clear to me that 
Hacker is the closest thing to Rob Lowe's The West 
Wing character I could hope to meet in person. A 
three-time collegiate national cycling champion, he's 
a triple threat: a celebrated intellectual, a top-tier ath­
lete, and, frankly, pretty handsome. On the day of our 
ride, even Hacker's salt-and-pepper stubble seemed to 
sparkle.


As Hacker and I dodged protruding sewer grates 
and made way for passing cars, I asked him about 
some of the darker aspects of the sport he has come 
to love.
I jumped straight in.


"Have you had any friends get killed while cycling?" 
At the heart of road biking, there's a bit of a par­
adox. If all goes well, you usually come back from 
your ride energized, relaxed, and more tolerant of 
the irritations of daily life. Exercise is understood to 
improve mental health, and if it's true of running on a 
treadmill, it's a good bet for biking as well. Whizzing 
through the countryside with little beneath you but 
a pair of wheels and nothing above you but the sky, 
life is better.


The risks of the sport, however, are hard to ignore. 
More than eight hundred cyclists have been killed 
each year since 2015, according to the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration. And though 
the odds of getting hit on any given ride might not 
be particularly high, it's little consolation as an eigh­
teen-wheeler zooms past. Cars have passed me by lit­
tle more than the length of the hair on my legs.


Hacker told me he hasn't had any friends killed in 
bike accidents, but he’s had some bad crashes of his 
own. A number of years ago, he was riding with a 
group from New Haven down Connecticut Route 17 
when he struck debris in the road. Unable to react in 
time, he was catapulted headfirst into the road's side 
rail, and his face split open. The other riders in the 
group called 911 immediately, and he was rushed to a 
hospital where he received the care he needed. If they 
hadn't been present, things may not have worked out 
as well.


"I would probably be dead," Hacker said. 


After the crash, he did not cycle for a long time, and 
he questioned whether the sport was really worth the 
risks. I asked him what ultimately brought him back. 
"The joy," he replied.


The shoulder narrowed, and he pulled ahead of me 
as we rode over a highway overpass. In the distance, 
the clustered trees of a nearby state park sat unmov­
ing beneath the overcast, light gray afternoon sky. To 
our right, a pair of birds circled patiently in the air. 
Moments later, a pair of cars took the opportunity to 
pass us. The noise of their engines growled in our 
ears from a few feet away, and my left-side peripheral 
vision was momentarily subsumed by a rush of black 
and gray, the colors of the cars driving past . A blend 
of suburban tedium, car-induced micro-terror, and 
pastoral ideal, it's typical of rides in the area.


We turned off Ridge Road and wound our way 
through a hilly neighborhood that sits between 
Hamden and North Haven. Feeling short of breath, 
I bracketed hopes for extended conversation and 
focused on keeping up. Hacker, ahead of me by a few 
bike lengths, had crested the section's final climb and 
began the descent. As I pushed my way to the top, 
Hacker tucked his forehead to his handlebars to mini­
mize air resistance and sped down the hill. A driveway 
sat treacherously at the bottom of the hill, partially 
hidden by a curve in the road. Ninety-nine times out 
of a hundred, the thinking goes, a driver would look 
both ways before exiting the driveway. As for the one 
in a hundred? Hacker and I are lucky to have health 
insurance.
