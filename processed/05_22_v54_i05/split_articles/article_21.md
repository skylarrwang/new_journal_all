A DYING 
    BUSINESS
BY ISABELLA YANG
To my father, who has just started 
washing dishes at a Chinese restau­
rant in North Carolina.

I wasn’t expecting the line to be 
so long. Beyond the point of Celia 
Pinzi’s outstretched finger, the line 
snakes backward from the hallway 
into the parking lot. It hugs the 
white wooden fences. Somewhere 
down the block, its end disap­
pears. Police are parked outside the 
building, directing traffic. This, 
Celia explains to me, is one of 
the largest post-lockdown crowds 
she’s hosted as the owner and chief 
funeral director of West Haven 
Funeral Home. It is around five 
p.m., and the wait time for those 
at the end of the line is estimated 
at five hours.

We walk through the back 
door, brushing past the lightly 
chattering, 
sometimes 
weep­
ing, extremely well-dressed, and 
orderly crowd of people that takes 
up half of the hallway. Celia briskly 
strides forward, occasionally stop­
ping to greet familiar faces, or to 
clear empty tissue boxes out of the 
way. She is dressed in all black, her 
medium-length blond hair tossed 
behind her back, and she wears 
a stern, concentrated expression. 
Worry not, it says. Everything here is 
under my control.

We walk on. An ornamental 
jumble covers the walls—there 
are clocks, mirrors, old maps of 
West Haven, pictures of sunsets, 
gold-sprinkled flower paintings, 
sketches of Italian towns, wreaths 
of dried flowers, decorative frag­
ments of old ceilings. When we 
pass some old-fashioned, can­
dle-like standing lamps, Celia 
turns to me.
“Now you’re in the heart of a 
traditional American wake,” she 
says.

When there is no wake, the 
entire funeral home smells of 
WoodWick’s signature Redwood 
reed diffuser; but as we walk into 
the parlor, the aroma of flowers 
permeates the air. Trails of flow­
ers, purple and white and yellow, 
follow the trickling line of people 
to a single point in the center of 
the room.

Against the soft white fabric 
inside the gleaming steel casket, 
the body of a 36-year-old woman 
lies with her hands peaceably 
folded in front of her chest. Under 
the soft glow of overhead incan­
descent lights, her long red hair 
shines like rivulets of water and 
cascades down the sides of her face, 
mingling with the flowers under­
neath. Visitors sob in front of her. 
Some may have touched her hair. 
With the line between me and her, 
I cannot tell. I cannot look at her 
for more than two seconds without 
feeling a need to avert my gaze––
because I didn’t know her, because 
Celia has turned her body into 
something too delicate and private 
to be beheld by an outsider. In fact, 
Celia has turned death itself into 
to be beheld by an outsider.

 ...
The only dead body I have seen 
up to this point in my life was that 
of my paternal grandfather, who 
was cremated in rural China when 
At the West Haven Funeral Home, 
Celia Pinzi keeps her macabre 
business alive in an increasingly 
challenging industry.

I was 12. I caught no more than a 
glimpse of him, stored in a wooden 
coffin filled with ice to keep his 
body from decaying in the summer 
heat. He hadn’t been embalmed; 
there were few embalmers in 
China, since so many people pre­
ferred cremation. His body looked 
blackened. Blackened by the ice, 
or old age, or both. There was lit­
tle glamor in the ceremony. Fam­
ily circled the coffin before it was 
taken off to the crematory. There, 
death was presented as a fact, a 
blackened fact.

At Celia’s place, things are differ­
ent. In the “prep room”—a metal­
lic, clinical space where bodies are 
received, washed, embalmed, and 
adorned—Celia shows me the box 
of cosmetics she and her fellow 
embalmer, Mike Dion, used on the 
deceased woman with the red hair. 
With tiny tweezers, she picks up a 
pair of artificial eyelashes from the 
stainless-steel table. “Would you 
believe that? People now have those 
magnetic eyelashes that they attach 
to the magnetic eyeliner they put 
on,” Celia says, pinching her eye­
lids and imitating the movement of 
applying eyeliner. “She used to use 
these all the time, so we just had 
to do the same.” Before the wake, 
she tells me, Mike had to make an 
extra run to grab a fresh pair from 
CVS.

One of Celia’s many jobs is to 
make death, however sudden and 
repellant, look presentable, even 
dignified. The woman with the 
red hair died of an overdose at a 
friend’s house. Her body, prior to 
entering the funeral home, under­
went an autopsy that carved a wide 
triangle in her chest and sliced 
open her head. Celia has made sure 
the body looks intact. Lacerations 
closed, eyes closed, mouth closed, 
hair done, nails done, magnetic 
eyelashes done. Though only the 
upper half of the casket was open 
for the wake, she put high heels on 
the woman’s feet. Underwear, too, 
is a must for every body that passes 
through her hands. A body must 
always be in good order, clean 
and preferably beautiful, but not 
only for the purpose of presenta­
tion. What people cannot see is as 
important to Celia as what people 
can see.

Dead bodies are among some of 
Celia’s most familiar things. She 
has been in the funeral industry 
for over forty years, and has han­
dled thousands of cadavers. But the 
embalming practice, Celia admits, 
can still feel foreign. “It's not just 
bathing, or grooming them, but 
actually making an incision into 
someone. Removing their bodily 
fluids and replacing them with 
embalming fluid,” she says to me. 
“How would you ever have expo­
sure to that?”

Celia was exposed to the death 
business by her father, Nello J. 
Pinzi. Nello, an Italian man who 
moved to Connecticut from Wis­
consin in the nineteen-sixties and 
founded West Haven Funeral 
Home, still has his picture hung at 
the entrance of the building. He 
was by Celia’s side as she ran down 
the same hallways we had walked 
through, after countless child­
hood days out ice skating on West 
Haven Green. He was by Celia’s 
side as she became an embalmer 
and a funeral director.

If Celia and I were to compare 
fathers, I think both of us would 
agree that they have little in com­
mon. Hers was born in Italy, came 
to America at a young age, and 
quickly found his place. Mine was 
born in China, came to America 
at a relatively old age, and is still 
struggling to find his place. Hers 
served customers from one town. 
Mine served customers from all 
around the world. Hers spent a 
lot of time with her. Mine spent 
next to no time with me. Hers was 
the person she modeled her career 
after. Mine is the person I deliber­
ately chose not to model my career 
after. But there is one thing they 
have in common: both ran busi­
nesses. Yet her father’s business is 
flourishing in her hands, while my 
father’s business collapsed into a 
debt-stricken shutdown after three 
agonizing years of trade wars, 
mysteriously-vanishing 
clients, 
and a pandemic.

Unlike Nello J. Pinzi, my father 
always made a strenuous effort to 
separate his daughter and his busi­
ness. Perhaps it was out of a mas­
culine unwillingness to ask his 
daughter for help. Or, more likely, 
perhaps he felt I could do better 
than his business. He was one of 
those “Made in China” tag makers, 
the first college student from his 
small rural town who went back 
to establish a small factory there, 
making large quantities of cheap 
clothes to be sold in North Amer­
ica. Though his factory made lots 
of clothes, many of them for chil­
dren, he almost never brought any 
home for me. His clothes, accord­
ing to my mom, were too ugly for 
me. I grew up wearing Korean 
brands my mom had handpicked 
from city-center shopping malls, 
while the extra samples printed in 
the factory were thrown onto our 
car’s backseat to be used as napping 
blankets.

In the fall of 2018, in the midst 
of Trump’s trade war with China, 
my father visited me in New
