those towns’ funds would have to 
go towards financial assistance for 
individual families, not to mention 
support programs like ESL classes 
at community colleges. Govern­
ment aid aside, many of the towns’ 
locals were fearful of a job market 
saturated by new arrivals, raising 
further issues of xenophobia and 
racism. 

This is the history our diaspora 
carries-–a history we negotiate as 
we create spaces like Pad Thai, 
spaces where we can safely exist 
together.

Ba Mai gestures to the man at 
the host stand—her husband—who 
smiles and waves. “This is Luong.” 
Older uncle. I smile back. 
“Your name is Candy, right?” 
My name is Kylie. I have a dis­
tant cousin back home who hap­
pens to be named Candy. For 
whatever reason, I assume she 
knows Candy, and because I only 
understand about ten percent of 
what Ba Mai is saying, my next 
assumption is that she must be 
asking if I know Candy. 
“Dawy,” I answer. Yes. I still 
haven’t cleared up my mistake 
with her. 

Ba Mai goes on. “You want to 
meet more kon Lao, right? Your 
daddy told me over the phone.” 
She pauses for a minute to 
think. “There are a lot of Lao peo­
ple [in Connecticut], especially in 
Bridgeport and by the Walmart. 
[There’s also] a temple we all go 
to in Morris. And if you want, I 
can take you there to meet every­
one…” 

It’s an enthusiastic outpour, 
delivered in the musical, up-and-
down cadence of our tonal lan­
guage. But much of Ba Mai’s 
other wisdom slips past me, and I 
find myself focusing mostly on the 
words I can recognize. I take what 
I can from the conversation any­
way: a paper bag of hot sticky rice, 
skewers of ping mu, and that feel­
ing of wholeness from the famil­
iarity of spoken Lao. That feeling 
of reconnecting with one of my 
kwan. 
“Kawp jai,” I say with my hand 
on the door. Thank you. 

April, of any given year
Pi Mai is always celebrated for 
three days in the middle of April. 
It marks the beginning of mon­
soon season, which is often the 
hottest time of the year. It is also 
the time of year when the Lao 
diaspora is most culturally visible, 
when we come together on the 
grounds of Theravada Buddhist 
temples around the world. 

In my hometown of Kansas 
City, Pi Mai looks like this: the 
open field by the temple where 
lines of tents sell sinh skirts of 
bright blues, purples, and greens; 
cheap bubble wands and cans of 
silly string for the kids; steam­
ing bowls of pho that lace the air 
with anise and cardamom. There’s 
a main tent where the uncles’ 
bands play mor lum on electric 
guitars and keyboards that appro­
priate cheesy nineties synth with 
a rhythmic Lao flair. The aunts, 
meanwhile, sway and arch their 
fingers in a traditional fawn dance, 
floating their hands along like 
flowers on the dance floor. 

Pi Mai is a cultural beacon, a 
welcome-home gathering for the 
local Lao community as well as a 
few curious outsiders from nearby 
towns. Tucked in the quiet of 
its own little corner is the tem­
ple itself, where monks in saffron 
robes perform su kwan, the long-
awaited ceremony that calls all 
thirty-two of our spirits back to 
our bodies. Finally, those spirits 
are bound to us when a monk ties 
to our wrists a bracelet of delicate 
white thread.

I’m in my room, talking to 
Luong Janh over the phone during 
his half-hour break at work. He 
is Ba Mai’s older brother and, 
according to my dad’s text from 
the day before, he is a community 
leader who can give me a broader 
sense of the Lao people living 
here. I have never seen his face.
Our call is mediated by my dad 
back home, splitting and mending 
our conversation from the North­
east and the Midwest. In real time I 
watch my transcription app incor­
rectly record Luong Janh’s spoken 
Lao as “Caitlyn Jenner longtime 
mean young lady,” “how to play 
an accordion with gun,” and then, 
“I’m a Libra. I’m a Libra. I’m a 
Libra. I’m a Libra.”
“Okay Kylie,” my dad says, then 
Luong Janh through my dad: “the 
Lao people are the people who 
want to reach out and help oth­
ers. It’s not just about our com­
munity—we want to reach out to 
everybody. We want to share. We 
want people to see our weddings 
and to visit for Pi Mai.” 

There are over fifty Lao fam­
ilies living in the New Haven 
area, according to Luong Janh. 
When he resettled in one of the 
first waves of Lao refugees, there 
were only about thirteen. And 
where they have contended with 
fragmentation, they also move 
continuously in the direction of 
wholeness. 
“Every 
time 
more 
people 
arrived, we would try to get in 
touch. We’d share our things with 
each other so we could all get by 
with what we had.” 


As my dad translates, I wonder 
if he is thinking the same about 
himself.

Luong Janh, Ba Mai, and the 
rest of the Lao community are 
not the only ones currently reach­
ing for wholeness in New Haven. 
Within the city, there is a grow­
ing momentum towards connec­
tion by broader groups of Asian 
Americans. On Zoom, I spoke to 
Jennifer Heikkila Diaz, Christine 
Kim, and Caroline Tanbee Smith, 
three leaders of aapiNHV (Asian 
American & Pacific Islander New 
Haven). The group was established 
about a year ago, spurred by wide­
spread community grief in the 
aftermath of the 2021 Atlanta spa 
shootings, along with the spike in 
anti-Asian hate crimes that made 
clear the need for AAPI spaces in 
order to see and be seen. 

“This group started as an action 
to overcome the great fear and 
anguish that a lot of us and I per­
sonally felt, especially after the 
shootings,” said Kim. One way 
to overcome these feelings was to 
come together. Like the Lao peo­
ple, to reach out and gather and 
share. Like our kwan, to join a 
body seeking a feeling of peace.

“Part of the way we did that was 
just by really holding space for 
each other’s experiences and sto­
ries,” Smith chimed in. “And that 
was a way of building a foundation 
of respect and acknowledgement 
of the complexity and differences 
that we all experienced moving 
through the world…”

Heikkila Diaz said the group 
finds itself in uncharted territory, 
as it is a non-hierarchical organi­
zation. They aim to grant all mem­
bers the same amount of influence 
in group activities, from youth 
to elders, and from East Asians to 
South and Southeast Asians—who 
have historically seen less repre­
sentation in pan-Asian groups.

I looked at the square on my 
Zoom screen and its four sub­
sections. Me. Jennifer. Christine. 
Caroline. Perhaps, in their own 
ways, they also embody our Lao 
patchwork of thirty-two.

I write my ending at the begin­
ning of Pi Mai. 

Tonight, I will catch up with a 
friend at one of the dining halls. 
Tomorrow, I plan to call my par­
ents and grandparents. On Sunday, 
I hope to go to the temple with 
Ba Mai and Luong Janh. Over 
the course of this piece’s creation, 
I’ve been called to a gathering of 
kwan that I did not expect to find. 

This weekend, I will call to mine 
and welcome back a body of thir­
ty-two. I think of everyone I’ve 
met in this process and wonder if I 
can make room for their kwan too, 
joining a body of sixty-four, one 
hundred twenty-eight, and maybe 
even two hundred and fifty-six. 
Maybe even more. 

I will tie us all together—for 
now—with a small white thread.
