My stomach hurts when I step 
into Pad Thai for a late lunch.

The visit is at my dad’s recom­
mendation, even though he’s only 
been to New Haven twice and to 
Pad Thai never. If this were any 
other Thai restaurant, I would’ve 
shrugged him off. What does 
he know about the New Haven 
restaurant scene anyway? Not 
much. But in this case, my dad 
does know the owner’s brother, 
who happens to be his bowling 
buddy back home in Kansas. Like 
me, the owners are Lao. And since 
coming to New Haven for school 
about eight months ago, I’ve yet 
to meet another Lao person. 

Though Lao-owned, Pad Thai’s 
menu is filled mostly with Thai 
dishes: chicken satay, a rainbow 
of curries, and som tam, a spicy 
papaya salad known to Laotians as 
tam mak hoong. Much of Thai­
land’s northeast Isan region is eth­
nically Lao, so Lao and Isan food 
are incredibly similar. But it’s 
actually quite common for busi­
nesses to brand themselves as Thai 
restaurants instead of Lao restau­
rants, even if they don't serve 
exclusively Thai cuisine. This 
makes their businesses more mar­
ketable to an American audience. 
Call it a visible invisibility.

I order the drunken noodles, 
which arrive in a golden-brown 
nest garnished with chili flakes, 
yellow bell peppers, and a sprig 
of holy basil. Wafts of steam tell 
me it’s too hot to start eating, 
but I choose to burn my mouth 
anyway. The food tastes like my 
dad’s—soft rice noodles balanced 
between the salt of the soy sauce 
and sweet suggestions of brown 
sugar. 

I could scream and cry about 
how good it is, about how it 
sends me back to my kitchen table 
at home in Kansas. But I eat in 
silence. It’s three o’clock, there is 
only one other group of patrons 
here, and I’m mentally preparing 
to introduce myself to the owner. 
The restaurant’s interior looks 
like my grandmother’s house—
dim and warm, the walls decorated 
with a yellowed map of Thailand 
alongside black-and-white por­
traits of family members that exude 
nostalgia. When I’m done eating, I 
ask for the owner, explaining that 
my parents are friends with her 
brother in Kansas and that I’d like 
to meet her. In a dirty apron and 
worn non-slip clogs, she emerges 
from the kitchen with slow, heavy 
steps. Still, her exhausted expres­
sion melts into a welcoming grin. 
It turns out that my dad had called 
earlier that weekend. She was 
expecting me. 

I’m always nervous when it 
comes to meeting new Lao peo­
ple, especially elders. Seeking 
Laotians outside of my family feels 
like an unearthing, like calling out 
to someone you haven’t seen in so 
long that you’ve become strangers.

**A Secret History**

March 6, 2020
Lao people are traditionally 
animists. Many of us believe that 
everything has a spirit, that every 
spirit has a home. Our bodies are 
home to not just one spirit, but 
to a collective of thirty-two that 
drift away from us as we progress 
through our lives. Every so often, 
they must be called back and retied 
to us, preserving our health, good 
luck, and balance. Kwan, we call 
them. Kwan, we reach out for but 
cannot see. 

Nay Saysourinho’s essay, “Your 
Body has Thirty-Two Kwan,” 
reminds me of all the things that 
make me, and I’ve been thinking a 
lot about her lately. She was a pan­
elist at a literary conference in San 
Antonio, which I attended during 
a trip with my high school English 
program. Most other panels had 
been canceled due to the emerg­
ing threat of the coronavirus, but 
it so happened that the one with 
Saysourinho was one of the few 
still taking place that day. It was 
also, by chance, the only panel 
I was interested in, a discussion 
about Asian exoticism in contem­
porary fiction. 

I remember almost falling asleep 
at the panel, drowsy from a late 
afternoon slump. But towards the 
end, the panelists began to open 
up more about themselves as Asian 
women in writing. When it was 
Saysourinho’s turn, she mentioned 
that she was raised by refugees. I 
sat up, my new sense of alertness 
motivated by my similar upbring­
ing. Curious, I looked back at the 
program and found her last name, 
distinctly Lao with its four flow­
ing syllables. My heart began to 
race. Suddenly, I didn’t want to 
miss a word she said. 

Looking back, I like to think 
that electric feeling, so unexpected 
and ineffable, was our kwan being 
called to each other. Growing up 
in Kansas, I rarely saw Lao peo­
ple outside of my own family. 
Surrounded instead by whiteness 
and its elimination of otherness, I 
wonder if I was made to drift from 
my kwan rather than the other 
way around, the way it naturally 
happens. I like to think that Say­
sourinho, who grew up in Can­
ada, understands me for this. 
Of the kwan Saysourinho lost in 
her own youth, she admits in her 
essay, “There are souls I no longer 
understand.”

A secret history
Lao people have a traumatic his­
tory of fragmentation. This his­
tory was never made clear to me 
until after high school, the result 
of my family’s unspeakable mem­
ories and a lack of information 
everywhere I tried to look. Even 
when my history teachers cov­
ered the Vietnam War, not once 
did they mention what was hap­
pening across the border in Laos. 
Growing up, I knew that there 
had been a war—my family called 
it “The War”—but I didn’t know 
much more than that. Most of this 
violence, muted and long-lasting, 
stems from the seldom-mentioned 
and often redacted history of the 
Secret War, an unauthorized mil­
itary operation carried out by the 
CIA on Laotian soil. 

The most destructive phase of 
the Secret War took place from 
1964 to 1973. Over the course of 
580,000 total bombing missions, 
the United States dropped more 
than two million tons of cluster 
bombs over Laos. To this day, 
only about one percent of the 
eighty million undetonated left­
overs have been removed. 

The bombings were an effort 
to thwart the North Vietnamese 
Army along the Ho Chi Minh trail 
and combat the communist forces 
of the Pathet Lao. Direct foreign 
intervention in Laos had been 
restricted by the 1962 Geneva 
Agreement. Nonetheless, to bol­
ster U.S. forces within Laos, Amer­
ican military personnel enlisted as 
“volunteers” of the Royal Lao Air 
Force to train a small group of 
Laotians and a larger group of the 
ethnically Hmong people living 
in the Laotian highlands. Once 
the U.S. withdrew after the Fall 
of Saigon, the Pathet Lao would 
go on to overthrow the royal gov­
ernment, persecuting the U.S.-
backed allies that were left behind. 
Waves of fleeing Laotians reset­
tled in America, scattered further 
by a far-flung network of sponsor 
families and Catholic volunteer 
agencies. As suggested by former 
President Gerald Ford’s Advi­
sory Committee on Refugees, 
these resettlement structures were 
intended to mitigate the economic 
strain on towns receiving these 
refugees. Should a concentrated 
ethnic enclave form, much of
