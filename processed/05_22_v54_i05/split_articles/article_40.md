EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
our suburban Pennsylvanian homestead. My hometown, growing off the edges of a turnpike, offered 
little in the way of adventure. Gas stations, fast food 
joints, and supermarkets clustered around the pike 
like pins on a magnet, while lush plains fluttered in 
my daydreams. My imagination filled in some gaps: 
telephone wires transformed into clotheslines, and 
the new-growth dogwoods became bulging maples 
ready for sapping. I could not, however, conjure 
acres of crops, and my mother’s perennially empty 
soil bed saddened me. Our little brush-cut lawn was 
too neat. I told my father to stop cutting our grass so 
that it could billow freely in the wind. He responded 
that, thanks both to biology and our development’s 
landscaping regulations, our grass could never grow 
as tall as the grass on the prairie. It was forever fet­
tered to a manicured existence. I could sympathize. 
I told my father that there was not enough rugged 
glamor in this life for me, not enough mustangs or 
twenty-foot snowstorms. My Old Navy sweaters 
and khakis were suffocating me. I was born to be 
draped in calico and gingham. 

My father—with his clean-shaven face and neat, 
professorial wardrobe—didn’t fit into my picture of 
a hardscrabble life on the American frontier, either. 
Instead of reading books by the TV, I wanted him 
to grow a full beard and oil muskets by the fire. I 
wished that he would, just once, stave off wildcats 
in the night instead of shooing away rabbits from 
the bushes. I mistook his gentleness for a lack of nec­
essary vigor. But in his own way, my father enter­
tained my fantasy. One July morning, he showed me 
that there were wild onions growing sporadically in 
the empty lot behind our house. We crouched down, 
observing how the clay-toned soil threw the onions’ 
emerald sprigs into relief. My father knew that I 
would delight in any opportunity to forage, to act 
out the enterprising nature I so admired in Laura. He 
offered to pay me ten cents per onion (ludicrously 
generous by eighteen-seventies standards), and I 
jumped at the offer. Every day that July, I scavenged 
for wild onions in the back lot. That summer was 
particularly dry, and heat relentlessly chased away 
the clouds and morning dew, baking the dirt of the 
lot into a leathery citrine. Only the most hardy tufts 
of grass and weeds survived––and, surprisingly, so 
did many wild onions, which flourished in otherwise 
barren patches.

My eyes sharpened. Soon enough, I could detect 
the wild onions’ slender bristles from a distance, even 
through the glare of the midday sun. Spotting one 
always brought the thrill of finding a clever hide-
and-seek player. If these onions learned to tame their 
unruly cowlicks, I thought, they’d be imperceptible. 
Upon finding an onion, I’d excise it carefully from 
the ground, never tugging its mane for fear of dam­
aging my precious find. After trowelling around it, 
I’d remove it with a surrounding womb of earth, 
then finish by dusting it off with reverence. I always 
felt a little intoxicated by the sharp-sweet smell of 
a freshly unearthed onion fermenting in the heat. 
Granular beads of juice dripped from the skin, accen­
tuating its luster and making it sticky to the touch. 
The bottom of the onion, where its slopes converged 
into a perfect point like the tip of a medieval helm, 
was my favorite. 

My delight in finding onions never wavered. I 
imagined that the barren lot, home of my prairie fan­
tasies, was once a rippling green plain now laid bare 
by a locust storm. And the miracles were believable: 
whenever it seemed I had exhausted the onion sup­
ply, I found that the weary earth somehow mustered 
the strength to graciously provide more.

One day, after harvesting a particularly bountiful 
crop, I squatted to detangle the onions’ knotted stems 
in the shade of the car in our driveway. Nearby was 
my mother’s small soil bed, which had been empty 
since she had attempted to cultivate basil there at 
the start of the summer. She planted the seeds and 
watered them diligently to no avail. Every day for a 
month, I watched her inspect the earth for signs of 
growth, but not even the smallest shoot emerged. I 
brushed it off. That, I thought, was life on the prairie. 
Not every crop had the fortitude of my wild onions.

As I untwisted and arranged my onions into neat 
three-by-three columns, I saw my father walk out 
of the house and approach the empty bed. He didn’t 
see me behind the car as he poked around the soil, 
examining it with a gentle bobbing of the head. I 
was curious; I thought only my mother nursed the 
fantasy that something might still sprout there.

But my father knelt gingerly beside the dirt and 
revealed a small pot, which had been nestled in the 
crook of his arm. I craned forward, convinced I was 
witnessing something secret. He pulled a miniature 
trowel from his pocket and dug a hole in the grave­
yard of my mother’s basil seeds. Tenderly and slowly, 
he extracted a tiny sprout from his pot and trans­
planted it. He muddled the mulch around the sprout, 
disguising its true identity, and threw the pot into the 
trashcan in the garage before hurrying back inside.

I watched all of this so intently that I didn't real­
ize my onions were frying on the pavement, their 
stems reduced to limp strings while their bulbs 
deflated like birthday balloons a week after the party. 
I took them back to the empty lot and left them in 
a row for animals to eat. I didn’t want to disappoint 
my father with low-quality produce. From the lot, I 
looked over to my house and saw my parents come 
outside. My father pointed at the bed, and they both 
doubled over, inspecting what I knew was the newly 
transplanted sprout. My mother sprang up, and her 
delighted voice rang out as she thrust her arms into 
a triumphant V above her head. I laughed to myself, 
knowing what she never would. She thought that the 
growth of her basil was a miracle. I decided not to tell 
her. I was content to turn back to my work, glanc­
ing up to see her silhouette moving in the heat, arms 
outstretched in victory like the stems of a wild onion. 
Only years later did I realize that the lot behind my 
house was completely barren after that summer—and 
that there were marks of my father’s affection that I 
didn’t see.
