hair sprouting through. Jovanni, 
though six feet tall, has a gentle 
way of holding themself. Their 
shoulders slope downwards—the 
curve of their back a concave 
“C.” Jovanni unscrewed various 
makeup jars, laying out a selection 
of tools. They began by slicking 
back their eyebrows with a purple 
Elmer’s glue stick. 
Jovanni is a drag queen. They 
were preparing for a performance 
at Partners, a gay club in New 
Haven. Their makeup routine 
took at least two hours, starting 
with three coats of a custard-like 
foundation. While waiting for 
each layer to dry, Jovanni fussed 
over my comfort. I assured them 
that I didn’t mind their cat Tux’s 
newfound interest in wrapping 
himself around my legs (he was 
a kitten, Jovanni explained), that 
I wasn’t cold with the window 
open (Jovanni was prone to over­
heating), that it was fine to leave a 
muted episode of Charmed on the 
television (it was a part of Jovan­
ni’s preshow routine), and that I 
hadn’t minded the drive to Jovan­
ni’s apartment in Hartford (they 
always got ready at home).  
Jovanni performs under the 
drag 
name 
Xiomarie 
LaBeija 
(Xiomarie, I was told, uses she/
her pronouns). Xiomarie is a reg­
ular presence at certain clubs and 
restaurants throughout Connecti­
cut and Massachusetts. She also 
performs at Pride parades, college 
LGBTQ events, charity fundrais­
ers for queer advocacy groups, and 
once, a retirement home. 


Xiomarie is not the thin, white 
drag queen you would expect 
to see on an episode of RuPaul's 
Drag Race, which has been criti­
cized for forwarding conventional 
beauty standards. Jovanni, now in 
their late twenties, is Afro-Latinx, 
gender nonbinary, and plus-sized 
(they sometimes refer to Xioma­
rie as “Xiomarie XL”). They told 
me that race and gender preju­
dices run rampant in the business, 
and it’s not easy to get opportuni­
ties when you don’t resemble the 
archetypical drag queen (thin and 
white). Drag, once a subculture 
forced to remain underground, 
has now come to resemble most 
other entertainment industries, 
luring people in with the promise 
of fame and money. Its prolifera­
tion is driven by mainstream pro­
grams like RuPaul, which purport 
to pluck queens out of obscurity 
and deliver them to the Met Gala 
or the pages of Vogue. This is the 
world that Jovanni exists within—
one that promises a neoliberal 
color- and gender-blindness while 
chasing the approval of institu­
tions that opened their doors only 
when they realized that drag sells. 

For Jovanni, though, drag was 
a calling. They spent most of their 
childhood in Bridgeport, Con­
necticut as “that fat gay boy.” At 
18, they were introduced to drag 
at a small gay club in Bridge­
port—the only of its kind at the 
time. Watching the performance, 
Jovanni had three thoughts in 
rapid succession: 
1. I can totally do that. 
2. I totally want to do that. 
3. I’m totally going to do that. 

There is a steep learning curve 
to drag. Before drag makeup tuto­
rials became commonplace on 
YouTube, most queens learned 
their professions through mentors. 
Many join “drag families,” where 
older members called “drag moth­
ers” take in fledgling performers. 
In a community where biologi­
cal relationships may be strained, 
these family units provide neces­
sary support. They also function 
as apprenticeships: older members 
train younger ones in presentation 
and performance. Jovanni learned 
how to vogue—a style of dance 
inspired by fashion model poses—
from their drag mother. Their 
drag family was also an early and 
crucial source of queer solidarity. 
It’s a tradition that Jovanni has 
carried on with their own drag 
daughters. 

Drag families are also important 
because jobs aren’t easy to find, 
especially paid ones. Fledgling 
queens might be asked to perform 
for free drinks or “exposure.” More 
established queens will bring their 
drag daughters on as supporting

on April 1, 2022.

      Partners Cafe in New Haven, Connecticut, 
This is the world 
that Jovanni exists 
within—one that 
promises a 
neoliberal color- 
and gender-
blindness while 
chasing the 
approval of institu­
tions that opened 
their doors only 
when they realized 
that drag sells.
acts, helping them find a foothold 
in the business. But even so, few 
drag queens make enough money 
to perform full-time. Jovanni has 
often had to work two or three 
jobs on top of performing. They 
recently got a full-time job as a 
caseworker at A Place to Nourish 
your Health, a Connecticut non­
profit that provides services for 
people impacted by HIV/AIDS, 
substance abuse, and mental ill­
ness. 

In Connecticut and Massachu­
setts, established queens are usu­
ally paid a flat fee of one to two 
hundred dollars per performance. 
These flat rates are barely enough 
to cover the cost of costumes, 
makeup, and transportation. Cash 
tips are what might make a per­
formance “worth it” for Jovanni, 
in terms of money invested versus 
money made. But tips are notori­
ously unreliable. Fewer and fewer 
people carry cash these days, and 
audiences that are new to drag 
may 
not 
understand 
tipping. 

Jovanni has adapted by advertis­
ing their Venmo account before 
and after performances. They have 
also always been frugal—driving a 
fifteen-year-old car that doesn’t 
have heating and improvising 
drag outfits from discount Hal­
loween stores. 

So why do they continue to do 
drag? Jovanni is full of aphorisms 
like “representation matters” and 
“everyone is equal.” These phrases 
mean more coming from someone 
like Jovanni, who truly believes 
that seeing a drag queen (espe­
cially a plus-sized one of color) 
could change someone’s life. And 
why not? It changed theirs. 

As Jovanni puts it, “The conver­
sation changes once I perform. I 
don’t think you’ve ever seen some­
one who’s three hundred pounds 
do handstands while lip-syncing.”

Drag began as female imperson­
ation. At one time, the success of 
a drag was judged on a cis man’s 
ability to pass convincingly as a 
cis woman. It was about creating a 
feminine silhouette—tucking gen­
italia up and away, padding the 
breasts and hips. It was about eras­
ing masculine features from the 
face—softening a jaw, paring back 
the brows. Julian Eltinge, a female 
impersonator at the turn of the 
twentieth century, sold out shows 
and scored astonished reviews in 
major newspapers. Eltinge became 
something of a fashion icon to 
women, who flocked to his shows 
to take note of his stylish gowns 
and exquisite posture. Though 
one is not necessarily indicative 
of the other, female imperson­
ation has long been associated 
with homosexuality, so Eltinge 
had to work hard offstage to prove 
otherwise. He gave interviews 
about his upbringing on a farm 
and his interest in duck hunting. 
Being perceived as gay was dan­
gerous at the time. Police often 
raided gatherings where men 
reportedly dressed like women. 
Attendees were arrested for “social 
vagrancy”—code for homosexu­
ality. As historian Sharon Ullman 
puts it, the public has tended to 
“read sexual practice onto public 
gender presentation.” 

Around the same time as Eltinge 
was on Broadway, the formerly 
enslaved William Dorsey Swann 
held secret cross-dressing balls for 
Washington, D.C.’s gay commu­
nity. Swann took on great per­
sonal risk in throwing these par­

ties, which were attended by other 
formerly enslaved Black men. He 
was arrested several times and sent 
to prison at least once. Writer 
Channing Gerard Joseph claims 
that, as the leader of his circle, 
Swann was known as the “queen 
of the drag”—“drag” being a port­
manteau for “grand rag,” a term 
for a masquerade ball. This, Joseph 
argues, would make Swann the 
first known drag queen. 

Swann makes a fitting prede­
cessor to Harlem’s balls of the 
nineteen-seventies 
and 
nine­
teen-eighties. These balls were 
almost 
entirely 
populated 
by 
Black and Brown members of 
the queer community, who gath­
ered to compete in events evoc­
ative of beauty pageants. Some­
times the contests were judged 
on “realness”—the ability to pass 
convincingly as the aspirational 
object, which could range from a 
businessman to a military officer, 
a gangster to a schoolgirl. Other 
times, contestants were judged on 
stylistic and dramatic flair. 

Ballroom culture was immortal­
ized by Jennie Livingston in her 
1990 documentary Paris is Burning. 
The film is credited with introduc­
ing the underground subculture 
to mainstream audiences, but it’s 
often overshadowed by the con­
troversy surrounding Livingston, 
a queer, white Yale graduate who 
has been widely criticized for not 
compensating her subjects despite 
the film’s considerable profits. The 
documentary depicts the balls as 
raucous and joyous gatherings 
of a vulnerable community. The 
specter of poverty, homelessness, 
and the coming AIDS crisis looms 
large. Inside the ballroom, though, 
a queen, draped in billowing gold 
lamé and donning black opera 
gloves, saunters down an impro­
vised catwalk. Audience members 
fling their hands back in mock-
swoons. 

Notably, the documentary also 
features “drag houses,” which is 
a grandiose way of describing a 
multigenerational 
family. 
“House” is borrowed from the 
term for royal bloodlines, as in “of 
Windsor.” Belonging to a house 
allows you to claim an artistic 
lineage; the best houses can often 
trace their roots back to these 
Harlem balls. (Jovanni belongs to 
the House of LaBeija, which touts 
itself as the first drag house.)  
Today, drag queens can be 
found performing anywhere from 
boozy brunches on the Upper 
East Side to children’s story times 
at public libraries. RuPaul’s Drag 
Race has won four Emmys and 
Leishla Thompson performs on stage at Partners Cafe in New Haven, Connecticut.
