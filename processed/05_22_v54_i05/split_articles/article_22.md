Haven and gave me a yellow 
leather jacket. It was a sample his 
factory had printed. His clothes 
had improved enough to suit my 
style, he insisted. On the same 
visit, he asked me if I could make 
a few calls to some potential clients 
in New York, since my English 
was better than his. Swamped with 
work and annoyed he couldn’t 
promptly get his tax return forms 
for my last-minute financial aid 
application, I put off making the 
calls. When I finally got around 
to it half-a-month later, no one 
expressed any interest. The few 
who didn’t hang up at the words 
“Chinese factory” asked about 
prices and sample types—questions 
I could not answer—so they hung 
up as well. Ashamed and infuri­
ated by my defeat, I sent my father 
a long text blaming him for not 
having provided outlines for my 
call and lists of his company’s past 
accomplishments. 
“Understood,” 
he responded. It wasn’t until a few 
hours later that I realized I had said 
“textiles” instead of “clothing” in 
most of the calls. I never wore the 
yellow leather jacket.


Now, my father’s business is 
officially 
dead. 
When 
cutting 
costs to the bone still did not yield 
any profit, and instead drove him 
deeper into debt, he closed the 
factory. He managed to pay all 
the workers, but only by borrow­
ing from loan sharks behind our 
family’s back. Earlier this year, 
my mother had to personally drag 
him to the sharks and pay off his 
nonbank debts using all of her sav­
ings. Bank debts remain unpaid. 
I wouldn’t say I’m responsible for 
his business’s demise. But I feel 
guilty. If I had learned how every­
thing works, would I have prevented 
this? Could I have saved his dying 
business?


Celia learned how everything 
worked, and Celia did save a dying 
business. Her mother was a teacher, 
just like my mother. Her mother 
had discouraged her from pursuing 
the “blue collar life” of her father, 
much in the way my mother dis­
couraged me from wearing those 
made-in-China factory clothes. 
Celia went to Georgetown. She 
decided to go back home and 
apprentice with her father after 
graduation. Recounting her moth­
er’s attitude toward her choice, 
she chuckles. “Given how we 
were brought up and what edu­
cation meant in our family… Yes, 
it’s respectable and all that. But it 
was not exactly, you know, the 
Georgetown…” Her voice trails 
off. I knew what she meant. The 
Georgetown graduate expectation. 
Or, perhaps more accurately, her 
mother's expectation.


But Celia chose her father’s path 
anyway. She acknowledged that it 
could be because she grew up very 
close to her father, but there was 
also a feeling of obligation, like she 
had to take over her father’s busi­
ness despite her mother’s reluc­
tance. At the time, though, neither 
she nor Nello was sure if she could 
do it. Celia repeatedly referred to 
the year she spent apprenticing 
with her father handling cadavers 
as a trial; she and Nello agreed that 
if she passed the trial, she would 
stay. “He was like boot camp. Very, 
very, very difficult,” she said. “And 
I thought if I can survive that, then 
I'm really okay.”


She survived. Nello lived for 
another twenty years, with his 
daughter running his business by 
his side, before his death in 2009. 
His funeral, including the embalm­
ing, was performed by his staff, and 
for once, Celia assumed the role 
of griever instead of director. To 
her, funeral directors are buffers 
between the family and death—
composed, professional figures that 
distraught families can rely on to 
shield them. Celia had acted as that 
buffer many times before, but for 
her father’s funeral, she let her staff 
be her Celia. She then took over 
the business completely, and peo­
ple started calling her “the boss.”


West Haven Funeral Home has 
long been the busiest funeral home 
in West Haven—by a mile. Keep­
ing it in the family keeps it alive—
the home has been handed down 
through generations, both for the 
family who owns it and for the 
families who use it. At the age of 
62, Celia has been recognized as 
“Celia Pinzi, L.F.D., past President 
of the Connecticut Funeral Direc­
tors Association and public mem­
ber of the Medical Legal Commis­
sion for the State of Connecticut.” 
In a trim blazer and sparkling 
jewelry, she strides down the hall­
way full of memorabilia from her 
father’s time, converses confidently 
and tilts her head intently when­
ever she inquires about a funeral 
detail, as if that detail were the 
most important thing in the world. 
The young apprentice freshly 
graduated from Georgetown has 
become a woman with wrinkles 
on her hands and neck beneath the 
jewelry, one whose vast experi­
ence has taught the subtle tricks of 
the death business.


One trick is to compartmental­
ize. Almost everyone at the funeral 
home agrees that compartmen­
talization is a necessity for their 
work. At home, the staff meticu­
lously avoid using the same brands 
of shampoo and shaving creams 
they use in the prep room; even 
the little things can bring death 
into the house. They also try to 
avoid emotional attachment to 
the cases they work on. Celia is 
extremely good at compartmental­
izing. When she works on a body, 
she forces herself to not think 
about the stories behind their 
death. “The things that disturb 
the average person disturb me,” 
she says. Suicides are always 
tough—so 
are 
overdoses. 
Working on children is the 
hardest for Celia, especially 
after she had her own kids 
and truly understood what 
the loss of a child can mean 
for a family. But when­
ever she gets emotional, 
she reminds herself that 
she is not there to walk in 
the family’s shoes. She is 
there to hold her breath 
in a room reeking of formaldehyde 
and to keep everyone calm.


Less appealing than the smell of 
formaldehyde, to Celia, is the cap­
italism of the funeral industry. “It’s 
all marketing and consumerism,” 
Celia tells me as we walk past the 
samples in her casket room: Cham­
pagne Rose, $4995; Belvedere, $1995; 
Clairmont, $3295; Valencia, $2695. 
Polished stainless steel caskets, gold 
and green and blue and purple, line 
up on wall shelves like jewelry on 
display. A corner with a sign read­
ing “CASKET EXPRESSIONS” 
contains customizable decorations, 
like little freezer magnets or laptop 
stickers, to be hooked on the edges 
or embroidered on the insides of 
caskets: an American eagle, golden 
angels, roses, jumping fish, army 
and navy prints, motorcycle prints. 
With thousand-dollar personal­
ized caskets, custom-made DVD 
tapes, and obituaries posted in 
the local newspapers, the price of 
a funeral can easily get into five 
digits, sometimes even reaching as 
high as $20,000—and that doesn’t 
include the gravestone, the recep­
tion, or the cemetery plot. The 
large wake I saw was just a part of 
one such funeral. For some, there is 
an allure in the dignified grandeur 
of an expensive funeral. Even one 
of the staff members at the funeral 
home, a young man around his 
thirties named Jim, tells me he quit 
a finance job in New York to work 
in the funerary industry with Celia 
because of the “formality, deco­
rum, and the black cars.”


The glamor of elaborate wakes 
and ceremonious burials endures, 
but behind the ornamental flow­
ers and delicately made-up bodies, 
things are changing in the death 
business, and Celia senses it. On 
the other side of the wall from 
thousand-dollar caskets sit the dif­
ferent, but equally various species 
of urns: Anoka Blue, $295; Ava­
lon Bronze, $495; Imperial Stone, 
$395; Tree of Life, $495. Celia 
points out a pair of smaller, pock­
et-sized urns called “footprints,” 
telling me they can be portable 
keepsakes and were used recently 
in 
another 
local 
middle-aged 
woman’s funeral. They are made of 
fine blue-and-white gradient por­
celain, polished to perfection, and 
cost no more than $295. Cre­
mations can cost a tenth of a 
full-scale funeral, or even less 
at places where procedures 
are not so personalized. To 
a community like West 
Haven, where many live 
paycheck-to-paycheck, 
the choice is obvious.


I’m no stranger to 
cremations. In China, 
where I grew up, a 
piece 
of 
legislation 
called “Regulations on Funeral 
and Interment Control” released 
in 1997 restricted all burials in cit­
ies and encouraged cremations in 
rural areas to preserve farmland. 
Burials quickly became things of 
the past, a relic now largely expe­
rienced through funeral objects in 
museums, excavated from ancient 
tombs. Cremations, on the other 
hand, exhibit a mechanical effi­
ciency that many prefer to the 
impractical pomp and ceremony of 
an old-fashioned burial. Beijing’s 
Babaoshan Crematorium processes 
approximately 25,000 bodies each 
year; bodies packed in cardboard 
boxes enter automated cremation 
machines on belts, burn in fur­
naces, and turn into ashes packed 
in little bags with QR codes to help 
families identify their loved ones. 
In modern Chinese crematories, 
operations are clean, quick, and 
minimalist. The funeral services, 
colloquially called yitiaolong (one 
full dragon), can take care of all the 
steps between receiving the body 
and delivering the ashes. A sim­
ilar service exists at Celia’s place 
now. In the middle of one of my 
conversations with Mike and Jim, 
Jim pauses to pick up a call from 
a potential client. The woman, 
whose grandmother had just passed 
away at a nursing home, wants 
West Haven Funeral Home to pick 
up the body, perform the crema­
tion, and deliver her the ashes. She 
doesn’t need to see the body. After 
the call ends, Jim, a strong propo­
nent of formal burials, sighs and 
says, “It’s another one of those.”


The “ones of those” have been 
taking over. The National Funeral 
Directors 
Association’s 
web­
site currently has a whole section 
called “Cremation on the Rise.” 
According to data from NFDA, 
cremations 
have 
outnumbered 
burials since 2014. Almost 60 per­
cent of bodies in the United States 
are now cremated, while a little 
under 40 percent are buried. It is 
estimated that in twenty years, 80 
percent of bodies will be cremated. 
The Vatican has even allowed 
practicing Catholics to be cre­
mated, despite their common belief 
in the resurrection of the physical 
body after death. COVID-19, too, 
is accelerating the change: crema­
tion is faster than burial—a great 
advantage during the pandemic 
when funeral homes are strained 
by an unusually large number of 
bodies—and the World Health 
Organization has recommended 
cremation instead of embalming 
to prevent the spread of the virus. 
Celia has referred to an open-cas­
ket funeral with an embalmed and 
dressed-up body as a “traditional 
American experience.” This tradi­
tion, it seems, is dying.


Oak Grove Crematory, the offi­
cial cremation branch of Celia’s 
business, now receives as much 
attention as the funeral home. 
In one corner of the casket room 
are pamphlets about “The Living 
Urn,” a new, $129 service that 
allows people to grow plants out of 
the ashes of their loved ones. Celia 
hasn’t gone as far as some funeral 
homes in incorporating services 
that turn ashes into cups, rings, 
fireworks, glass art, memorial tat­
toos, or vinyl records, but she is 
already adjusting to the new trends 
to keep her business alive.


There is, however, only so much 
one can adjust and only so much 
one can control. Celia has her 
uncontrollables: kids who do not 
want to take over the family busi­
ness. Unlike my father, who kept 
me away from his business, Celia 
would very much love for her two 
sons to take over her place. But 
reality speaks differently. Both 
of her sons live in New York 
now. One graduated from Yale 
and works for American Express, 
the other works for the Miche­
lin-star-winning 
Momofuku 
Restaurant Group. Neither has 
any intention of returning to West 
Haven. They believe they could do 
better than her business.


We are in Celia’s car driving 
back to campus when I ask her 
what will become of West Haven 
Funeral Home. She stays silent 
for a good moment, and I see her 
tighten her grip on the steering 
wheel.
“Big corporations will buy it,” 
she finally says. She would retire 
completely and receive good com­
pensation. But is that what she 
really wants?


When Nello started the business, 
he named it “West Haven Funeral 
Home” so it carried the name of 
the town instead of his own Ital­
ian name. Back then, West Haven 
was a town divided between Ital­
ians and Irishmen; funeral homes 
served either one group or the 
other, and a place named “Pinzi 
Funeral Home” would only attract 
Italians. But Nello wanted his 
place to belong to everyone in 
West Haven. Through the name, 
he left Celia with a special legacy. 
She feels the weight of the name 
every time she sees a crowd gather 
in her hallway and spill into the 
parking lot, or when she and Mike 
restore a mutilated body’s dignity 
and open the casket for visitors 
to weep at the ephemeral beauty 
of their loved one, resting among 
flowers, which will soon become
