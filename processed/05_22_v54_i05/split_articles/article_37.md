EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
My father and I drive in silence. No sound but the grinding of the gears. A car as old as my resentment. He shifts for 
me. Then the sudden urge to hit metal to metal, sending the car skidding endlessly towards an end. Handling stick 
is like handling a woman so why couldn’t he be good to my mother. As if responding, the leather on the steering 
wheel begins to peel away. Black bits sticking to my hands. The neighbourhood we drive through is a place I’ve 
always wanted to grow up in: houses big enough to hide anything you want. Anywhere you want.  The trees lining 
the road guide us into a dream of gentle suburbia, where someone tightly holds their child.  She has not yet torn up 
the pages. A jaguar slinks by carrying someone’s father. I ask the trees what a metal box could do to erase the drift 
between generations.


I sleep the dream of a sick person
Between my dreams there are patches of darkness that vibrate to the pulse of whatever love song I heard last. 
The black pulses are desperate. 
There is a film called loving where all the people kiss for three minutes. 
my fists clench where their eyes meet.
I go out into the streets in the middle of the night.
Is loving in this tree? In the scent of a flower? In the stones of the stair?


Yesterday we drilled seven holes in the wall trying to look for a place to hang my mosquito net.
So that I could have a place to rest.
The first hole was Thunder Road—I held you as you cried in the parking lot.
The second was the races. I still have the picture: me bald, you alive.
The third was an empty Josh Groban CD case stashed in between the car seats.
The fourth is a leather passport case.
The fifth hole is the frame of our picture at the races. It is made of cardboard, pink beads and playdough.
The sixth is the thing that holds up the frame, which is missing. 
The seventh is when you came to our bake sale and made the other dads laugh
by putting queen cakes on your head.
Today my only home is a P.O. Box.

eetering mountains of

plastic IKEA drawers overflowing 
with costume jewelry. On a pile of 
clothing hangers in an open suit­
case, a black cat perched.

from a cut nude stocking. It had a
