she/her pronouns, and went by 
Xiomarie. It was easy to pass, but 
being Xiomarie all the time didn’t 
feel authentic. “I realized I needed 
to take her off,” Jovanni told me. 
“I almost lost myself.” 
The transition also stopped, 
in part, because Jovanni moved 
home with their mother. They 
grew up in a traditional Chris­
tian family, where church was a 
big part of everyday life. Jovanni’s 
mother believed that homosexu­
ality was a sin and that Jovanni’s 
queer identity was a curse. Jovanni 
said, “For years, I’ve compromised 
my identity just to make sure that 
I wasn’t disappointing her.”  
Early this year, Jovanni had a 
breakthrough with their mother. 
inspired six spin-offs. As drag has 
found new audiences, it has also 
found new practitioners. Trans 
and cis women, as well as nonbi­
nary people have established forms 
of drag. Drag has long been tied 
to public and private expressions 
of the queer self, whatever form 
that may take.

In Hartford, Jovanni drew out 
the contour of their nose with 
an even hand. They left this 
unblended. They overlined their 
lips into a pink pout. As I watched 
them carve out the shadow of 
a cheekbone in a deep brown, 
Jovanni promised, “It’ll all come 
together.” 
Drag is meant to be an exag­
geration. Lashes are often inches 
long and thick as caterpillars. 
Wigs are voluptuous and flow­
ing. The point is to sell a fantasy, 
but not the fantasy of the ‘ideal 
woman,’ or at least not one you 
might imagine gracing the cover 
of Sports Illustrated or Cosmo­
politan. Drag is femininity in the 
extreme, so extreme that it might 
defy femininity altogether. There 
is no illusion of realism. Drag is a 
satire of gender performance, ask­
ing, ‘what is gender anyways?’ 
Jovanni might know better than 
anyone. They’ve moved through 
a spectrum of gender identities—
cis man, trans woman, nonbinary 
person. When they first entered 
the drag community, Jovanni 
thought they were a gay man 
trying out a new form of self-ex­
pression. Xiomarie, their drag 
alter ego, was just one facet of 
themselves. But Jovanni never felt 
quite at home in their masculinity. 
At college and away from home 
for the first time, Jovanni started 
identifying as a trans woman. 
They wore their hair long, used 


During the last hour of a long 
drive back from Baltimore (where 
Jovanni had two very successful 
gigs), their mother called. Jovan­
ni’s brother had always been 
supportive 
and, 
unbeknownst 
to Jovanni, had confronted their 
mother about her relationship 
with Jovanni. He knew that 
Jovanni’s 
strained 
relationship 
with their mother was prevent­
ing Jovanni from fully embracing 
their identity. 
During this call, Jovanni finally 
told their mother about being 
nonbinary. They also told her 
about their career as a drag queen. 
To Jovanni’s surprise, their mother 
was supportive.
“We were able to break down 


boundaries and barriers that have 
been up for so long,” Jovanni told 
me, “And I was able to hear words 
that I’ve never thought—even 
in my dreams—I would hear.” 
Jovanni felt that a burden had 
been shed, that they could finally 
be themselves in all facets of their 
life. 
What does drag mean to some­
one who has struggled with 
expressing their queerness? It 
might seem odd that someone 
who has rejected the gender 
binary would come to embrace an 
art form that seems to be a perfor­
mance of gender in the extreme. 
But as queer scholar Nick Cherry­
man writes, “Much of mainstream 
drag comes to represent another 
gender altogether removed from, 
yet integrally linked to, the social 
idea of the gender binary…The 
‘drag queen gender’ [exists] in the 
queer-‘other.’” Drag isn’t easily 
categorized into male or female 
gender expression. It is a form of 
gender expression within itself. It 
has its own gender norms—expec­
tations of social behavior, physical 
appearance, and sexual prefer­
ences. These norms are enforced, 
like most gender stereotypes, by 
both in- and out-group members. 
In a subculture under much public 
scrutiny, the expectations may be 
more stringent. 
Drag is a performance much 
like—à la Judith Butler—all gender 
is a performance. It’s a testament 
to Jovanni’s skill as a performer 
that I found it difficult to pin­
point the moment Jovanni became 
Xiomarie. I asked them if there is a 
particular moment when they feel 
themselves stepping into another 
identity. “When I have those 
lashes on,” Jovanni said, “honey, 
This was a six-foot-tall, 
three-hundred-pound 
person executing a 
five-minute dance 
routine with the pep 
and stamina of a Dallas 
Cowboys cheerleader.
you can’t tell me anything.” 
Jovanni and I parted ways at 
their apartment in Hartford, tak­
ing our own cars to the venue. 
When I arrived at Partners in New 
Haven, it was Xiomarie I found. 
She was in a makeshift dressing 
room in the dingy basement of 
the club, putting the final touches 
on her look. Xiomarie wore a tie-
dyed leotard with sewn-on yel­
low mesh sleeves, trimmed with 
large rhinestones. Paired with a 
flouncing and voluminous pink 
wig, it gave the effect of an nine­
teen-eighties aerobics instructor 
to the nth degree. 
The club was packed, leaving 
little room between Xiomarie 
and her audience. The closeness 
made the physicality required for 
her routine all the more obvious. 
When Xiomarie flung her leg into 
a perfect high kick or launched 
herself off the stage directly into a 
split, you could feel her movement 
through the air, hear the thud of 
her heeled boots against the floor. 
This was a six-foot tall, three-
hundred-pound person executing 
a five-minute dance routine with 
the pep and stamina of a Dallas 
Cowboys cheerleader. As prom­
ised, everything came together in 
the performance. The makeup was 
meant to be seen in movement. 
Even from across the club, you 
could make out every lip-synced 
word and dramatic wink. The wig 
clung to place through each hair 
flip and somersault. (I later learned 
that Xiomarie had duct-taped the 
wig to her scalp.) Between the 
headstands and the triple axel, 
but before the closing death drop, 
Xiomarie had worked the crowd 
into a fervor. They jostled against 
each other to get a better view. 
They cheered so hard their vodka 


sodas splashed onto their neigh­
bors. Those who had brought cash 
were frantically waving it, which 
Xiomarie collected with appropri­
ate dramatic flair. 
Drag is a fantasy that engages 
both the performer and the audi­
ence. There are meaningful com­
parisons to be made between drag 
and stripping, as queer scholar 
Sarah 
Hankins 
notes. 
Some 
queens, like strippers, create inti­
mate and even erotic connections 
with audience members. There 
may be individualized attention, 
the allowance of some touch, or a 
privately shared smile. Like strip­
pers, drag queens rely on cash tips 
and know how to get them. Like 
strippers, drag queens work in the 
medium of their body. There is 
the flourish of an arm, the swivel 
of a hip, the extension of a leg. 
There is something sensual and 
heady about the performance and 
its proximity. You feel that, per­
haps, you can share in the queen’s 
beauty. 
By the end of Xiomarie’s set, the 
stage was littered with crumpled 
bills. The hostess, a drag queen in 
a red Jessica Rabbit dress named 
Kiki Luca, commanded “white 
twinks” in the audience to get on 
all fours and collect the money. In 
the tittering commotion, Xiom­
arie disappeared into the back of 
the club. 
In the dressing room, I found 
Xiomarie draped over a velvet 
sofa, trying to catch her breath. 
The other queens were either 
recovering from or preparing for 
their own performances. It looked 
like a beauty store had exploded. 
All over, there were open bottles 
of loose glitter, disembodied man­
nequin heads (for wigs), tins of 
translucent powder, and all sorts 
of serums and glues and creams. 
Xiomarie seemed to be taking it 
all in—the cacophony of queens 
trading barbs and the din of the 
crowd upstairs, the soft blanket of 
cigarette smoke and hairspray set­
tling over the room. 
I was watching from my own 
corner, thinking about how drag 
returned the body to itself. Drag 
removes the body from what it 
means or what it should be. The 
body just is.

Back in the dressing room 
though, Jovanni had more import­
ant things to do than agonize 
over the phenomenology of it all. 
There was only one hour between 
the first and second show and an 
entire costume change to execute. 
Tape was readjusted, dresses shim­
mied off, wigs swapped, powder 
reapplied to every crevice. 
After all, the show must go on.
