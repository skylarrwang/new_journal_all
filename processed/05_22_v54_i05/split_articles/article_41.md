My mother let me sit in the front seat of her car when 
I was far too young to sit in the front seat of any car. 
None of my friends were allowed to sit there. They 
all sat in the back and their mothers waited until they 
buckled their seatbelts before driving. My mother never 
reminded me to buckle my seatbelt, but I did anyway 
because I knew that kids were supposed to use seatbelts 
and the other mothers would look down on my mother 
if they found out I wasn’t. 

My mother always had the radio playing in her car: 
100.5. I traced circles in the frost from the cold water 
vapor on the passenger seat window. My mother drove 
fast, her car chasing the street lights and the moon 
chasing us, and the radio playing “Hey There Delilah.” 
What’s it like in New York City, he asked. I didn’t 
know what New York City was. I didn’t really want 
to know. I drew a tulip in the frost, bending my knees 
so that I was sitting like the ugly bird my mother once 
showed me in a science book. Tonight you look so 
pretty, he sang. I leaned my chin against the window 
and traced a butterfly, then covered the drawings with 
my thumb because I didn’t want anyone to see them.

THE POPSICLES ARE MELTING 
AGAIN

The Walgreens coolers aren’t cool. The hollowed-out 
stumps hug the Fanta-orange tulips (she loves tulips). 
You’re scouting out perches, not-so-secret gardens, and 
benches if they’re free around noon. These unending 
days make you feel invincible, but also bring a tinge 
of nightly turbulence. Are you sun-kissed or is that 
sucker-punched feeling just a fever? You indulge in 
three-hour naps. You dream of Managuan rainstorms, 
but then remember what humidity does to your hair. 
You miss the snow because it was new, but you like the 
trees because they are old. “They weren’t supposed to 
have flowers on them.” But they do. You’ve always liked 
generous seasoning, but you never quite understood the 
seasons like you did on Tuesday. 

It’s these big, little changes that grip you. 

Your friend wears silver streaks in her hair, but she’s not 
graying—she’s just bored. It’s a blissful sort of restless­
ness. Dangerous, even. 

You asked her for blue streaks in yours. 

The sprouting of spring feels like the tinsel tied to your 
curls. It glimmers, it hides. It tucks behind your ears, and 
sometimes when they see it, strangers speak to you for 
no reason at all.
