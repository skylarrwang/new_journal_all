discovered that the space below the Rotunda had 
beautiful foundation walls made of local Stony Creek 
Granite hidden behind the plaster,” she said, “making 
it a natural fit for the student-requested area where 
alcohol could be served.” Surprised by the notion 
that students had spearheaded the idea for The Well, 
I searched for the document DelVecchio mentioned.
The closest thing I could find was a ninety-six-page 
report from 2015 entitled “The Schwarzman Center 
Advisory Committee: Report to Yale President Peter 
Salovey.” The titular committee, composed of only 
twelve students (four of whom were undergraduates) 
and fifteen faculty and staff, envisioned in meticulous 
detail the space and programs that would one day 
comprise the Schwarzman Center: “‘Sunrise Yoga’ 
lessons in the Dome Room at seven a.m.,” “periodic 
wine and cheese parties for g&p students…in the 
Presidents’ Room,” and “several Yale minibuses…
on site to take students safely home” are just some of 
the many offerings described with rhetorical flourish. 
It was replete with flashy graphics, five appendices, 
a narrative describing “A Day in Schwarzman,” and 
only passing discussion of The Well. This seemed 
to be the official document which largely informed 
the completed Schwarzman Center we know today. 
Although this document did reference a space which 
would sometimes serve alcohol—“We do think that 
wine and beer should be available in the Bistro in the 
evenings,” it says—it contained scant rationale for 
such a space. The committee wrote that, “We hold 
the hope that offering beer and wine will stem the 
‘pre-gaming’ drinking tendency, at least for events at 
the Schwarzman Center.” Although it did seem that 
some students had some minor role in the idea for The 
Well, I was curious whether this was representative of 
the student body’s views as a whole.

I continued my search and found a document from 
2014 titled “Student Center at Yale,” released by the 
Yale College Council (YCC), the Graduate and Pro­
fessional Student Senate (GPSS), and the Graduate 
Student Assembly (GSA). In this eleven-page doc­
ument, where the student governments argued for 
the merits of a student center, there were no refer­
ences to the sipping of spirits. The document had the 
word “alcohol” fourteen times, with the suffix “-free” 
appended almost every time. Student desires centered 
on a departure from Yale’s drinking culture, rather 
than further investment in it. My confusion abounded. 
DelVecchio claimed that the vision for a bar came 
from a student request. While the 2015 report she ref­
erenced did indeed include a vague recommendation 
for a space which served alcohol, it did not clearly 
indicate that this came from the students (who com­
posed a minority of the committee) and provided only 
minimal rationale for the space. When contrasted with 
the enthusiasm and idealism with which the student 
governments had described their vision of a space to 
provide alcohol-free programming—described as “a 
student center with compelling alternatives to drink­
ing [which] would disentangle campus-wide social 
interaction and alcohol consumption…[and] foster a 
greater sense of community across the university”—I 
found DelVecchio’s claim of student support for The 
Well to be unconvincing.

I wondered if student attitudes towards a bar on 
campus had grown more outwardly favorable in the 
past eight years, so I turned to my friends for their 
perspectives. “Schwarzman is just made to entertain 
Yale’s donors, surely The Well is no different,” came 
one cynical response. “I am just waiting until a pro­
fessor holds office hours there,” another friend chuck­
led as we walked by it one day. “I think it would be 
inappropriate if [a professor] is even sighted there!” a 
third friend responded. I had yet to find a student who 
was enthusiastic about The Well, although there were 
plenty who were skeptical. 

As if in answer to my continued bewilderment, an 
email arrived from Dr. Maurice Harris, the Direc­
tor of Marketing and Communications for the 
Schwarzman Center. “The design and programming 
of Yale Schwarzman Center, based on the vision of 
Yale’s three student governments,” he wrote, “called 
for a space onsite that could offer beer and wine to 
stem the ‘pre-gaming’ drinking tendency.” He added 
that, originally, The Underground would have hosted 
the beer and wine offerings, but planners feared the 
risk of underage drinking in such a “popular, all-ages 
venue.” Finally, he concluded, “The Well provides a 
way to honor students’ original vision while enforc­
ing our commitment to the care and safety of our 
Yale community.”

This appeal to students’ enjoyment of partying 
seemed to be an insufficient explanation, too. The 
phrase “pre-gaming tendency” was also used in the 
Schwarzman Center Advisory Committee report, 
which barely referenced spaces that serve alcohol. If 
Harris’ discussion of “Yale’s three student govern­
ments” is a reference to the report from 2014, then 
his claim that a space serving alcohol was the vision 
of the student governments seems untrue. That report 
never asks for a place that serves alcohol, instead argu­
ing for the merits of alcohol-free socialization. If he 
is instead referencing the 2015 Schwarzman report,

claiming that the recommendation of the committee 
(with a minority of students) is the “students’ vision” 
seems an exaggeration. Perhaps there is another, defin­
itive declaration of the student governments’ vision? 
Hours of searching yielded no answer, and when I 
asked Dr. Harris for clarification, he directed me to 
a website which only included links to the 2014 and 
2015 reports. These reports hardly constitute evidence 
for a pre-existing student desire for The Well––and 
verge on cherry-picking. It seemed that the adminis­
tration’s carefully crafted language and repeated attri­
bution to the student governments' vision lacked any 
definitive proof in the public record; in fact, there was 
ample evidence to the contrary.

Yale presents itself as a progressive institution that 
believes in harm reduction, which fits its reputation as 
an Ivy League school home to a relatively robust social 
scene. Rather than RAs who administer punishment 
for underage drinking, Yale employs FroCos who pour 
out the alcohol when they catch first-years with red 
Solo cups. The University asks all students to undergo 
training administered by The Office of the Alcohol 
and Other Drugs Harm Reduction Initiative, which 
promises that they will not get in trouble or have their 
parents contacted if they seek help for alcohol-related 
health incidents. But when it comes to implementing 
safety measures that threaten to compromise their rep­
utation, Yale falls short. Although there is no Greek 
life officially sanctioned by the University, Yale coex­
ists with frat houses that throw raucous parties only 
steps from its academic buildings and most of its first-
year dorms. Students are still commonly brought to 
Yale Health in ambulances due to alcohol poisoning, 
fraternities are the sites of sexual assaults involving 
intoxicated students, and it is socially acceptable for 
people to drink as frequently as five nights per week. 
This culture does not seem healthy or balanced, but 
Yale allows it to exist.

The Well, on the surface, seems like another mis­
guided half-measure to reduce harm without really 
changing anything—a student-safety advertisement 
wrapped in a Yale bow. In reality, students didn’t 
seem to ask for anything close to The Well, nor does 
it reduce the “pre-gaming tendency” for the quarter of 
the undergraduate population that’s of legal drinking 
age. Are we meant to believe an on-campus bar that 
closes at 11 p.m., serves single glasses of beer that cost 
as much as a handle of cheap liquor, attracts mainly 
professors, and lacks all the charming interior décor 
of Sig Nu is really going to tempt students away from 
their Dubra shots and drinking games?

Rather than taking further steps to address the 
many issues facing the student body, the Universi­
ty’s choice to sink millions of dollars into the con­
struction of The Well allows Yale to applaud itself 
for reducing “pre-gaming” without designing an 
establishment to do that. This carefully constructed 
space reflects a familiar tactic of the administration in 
dealing with student complaints: it curates exclusive 
spaces that appear to be a solution, but in fact leave 
the roots of problems intact. To a professor or donor 
sitting in the basement of Schwarzman, watching one 
or two students slowly sip their alcoholic beverages, 
the drinking culture of Yale might appear safe. Yet 
this does not capture the mad, weekly rush to High 
Street, the toilet bowls full of vomit, and the ambu­
lance calls routinely made by concerned friends after 
long Saturday nights. Melisa DelVecchio’s team may 
have peeled back the plaster of the basement room, 
but their true contribution was not to reveal beautiful 
Stony Creek Granite: it was to hide the dark reality of 
the Yale Administration’s often dangerous and dys­
functional attitude towards alcohol consumption on 
campus.
