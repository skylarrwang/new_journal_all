home in December, Amir’s daugh­
ter tested positive for high blood-
lead levels. Just as in Naz’s case, 
the test triggered a legal duty for 
the city to inspect the property 
within five working days of the 
report. Internal city documents 
show that the Health Department 
did not inspect Amir’s apartment 
until February 9, 2022—almost 
two months after Amir’s daughter 
had tested positive. The reason for 
the delayed inspection, written on 
Health Department documents in 
neat cursive, was, once again, “lan­
guage barriers.”


When 
Health 
Department 
inspectors arrived at the apart­
ment, they found toxic amounts 
of lead paint at seventeen differ­
ent locations, including within 
the family’s kitchen, living room, 
and bedroom. The report ordered 
the landlord to repaint the inte­
rior rooms and the building’s front 
porch, where lead on the doors 
and windows were sixteen times 
greater than the concentration 
deemed “hazardous.” In response, 
the landlord presented Amir with 
a document and asked him to sign 
it. “During time of construction, 
[Amir and his family are] going for 
a few days (3 days or more) to their 
relatives with his family,” the writ­
ten agreement read. “During this 
time the managers will change the 
windows, paint the apartment.” 
Amir agreed, and left for a few 
days in March.


Amir’s landlord made no men­
tion of lead or hazardous health 
conditions 
in 
the 
agreement. 
What’s more, the 2021 settlement 
requires that where lead paint is 
found in New Haven, children 
and their families must be relo­
cated “at the expense of the prop­
erty owner,” and not on their own 
dime, as Amir did. Amir told me 
that he guessed why his landlords 
removed the paint, after hearing 
from his daughter’s pediatrician 
and reading educational mate­
rials sent by the Health Depart­
ment. Had he depended solely on 
his landlord for information, he 
wouldn’t have known that lead 
paint was even present.


Amir and his family weren’t 
the only IRIS clients placed in a 
lead-contaminated property via a 
pre-arranged lease: his caseworker, 
Zaker Sultani, was resettled to 
one himself. In an earlier inter­
view with me, Sultani confirmed 
that before he worked for IRIS, he 
had formerly lived at 18 Dewitt 
Street—the Naqibzois’ past prop­
erty. Our conversation in Febru­
ary, 2022 was the first time he had 
heard about the toxic lead in his 
old backyard. His children, a fif­
teen-month-old and a four-year-
old, regularly played in the soil 
behind the house, sometimes for 
two hours a day. “Ocean Manage­
ment was very callous, very reck­
less,” Sultani told me. “From day 
one, the property was filled with 
mice.” 


I could not confirm whether 
Amir’s or Sultani’s homes were 
tested for lead before they arrived, 
either by their landlord or IRIS. 
But the eventual discovery of lead 
contamination on those properties 
suggests that pre-arrival inspec­
tions did not occur. 


Resettlement agencies like IRIS 
are required, as a condition of their 
federal funding, to ensure that ref­
ugees’ housing is “free of visible 
health and safety hazards and in 
good repair.” Their cooperative 
agreement with the State Depart­
ment states, “no peeling or flak­
ing interior paint” for dwellings 
built before 1978. “IRIS is stuck 
between a rock and a hard place,” 
Amy Marx, the NHLAA attorney, 
said. The organization is responsi­
ble for finding refugees housing, 
but it remains under-resourced, 
and constrained by poor condi­
tions that afflict most affordable 
units in New Haven. 


When I arrived outside Amir’s 
building for the second time, hop­
ing to speak with his property 
owner, a man of middle age in a 
gray pickup truck arrived. He got 
out of his car and stared at me icily. 
I explained to him that I found the 
address and its lead paint inspec­
tion results from New Haven’s 
public records.  


“Why do you all care about 
this?” he said. “They”—gestur­
ing at the building, where Amir’s 
family lived—“had lead in them 
before they arrived. They came 
here from Mandy.” Mandy Man­
agement is another local landlord 
whose properties are frequently 
found with housing code viola­
tions. When I asked whether any 
tenants on the property had been 
informed of their rights while the 
landlord removed lead paint, as 
required by law, he said he did not 
care to answer.


“I shouldn’t be talking to you,” 
he said. “I’ll report you for tres­
passing!” He told me to leave.


One IRIS employee recounted 
the condition of a basement in 
one Mandy Management-owned 
apartment, which was being rented 
by refugee clients. It “would make 
you vomit,” he told me. There was 
“raw sewage, spilling onto a base­
ment floor, attracting maggots, it 
was the result of ridiculously dumb 
plumbing.” Despite the risks of 
renting with Mandy or Ocean, the 
employee said, there are few alter­
natives for refugee clients, given 
the two firms’ dominating shares 
of affordable housing stock in New 
Haven. Multiple IRIS employees 
wished not to speak on the record 
for fear that Mandy and Ocean 
Management would retaliate by 
refusing to rent to future clients.

THE  NEW  JOURNAL
Mandy, alongside Ocean Man­
agement, have been called “inves­
tor-landlords” in local press. “The 
pattern we see,” Marx said, “is that 
these landlords continue to neglect 
their properties.” ‘Investor-land­
lords’ partner with private-equity 
firms, who package landlords’ loans 
into mortgage-backed securities, 
then 
purchase 
formerly-owned 
properties with the extra credit and 
convert them to rental housing, 
largely in low-income neighbor­
hoods. Ocean’s director, Shmuel 
Aizenberg, put 101 multi-family 
homes on the city’s housing market 
as a $52 million package deal last 
month. This Monday, Aizenberg 
pleaded guilty to charges brought 
last October for fifteen housing 
code violations at three properties. 
He paid a fine of $3,750.


A representative of Ocean Man­
agement told me in February that 
the company did not currently 
keep a maintenance agency. “We 
get Farnam Realty Group to out­
source for us,” the representative 
told me. (As of April 30th, Farnam, 
a local brokerage firm, had severed 
ties with Ocean Management.)


When I inquired about Wade 
Beecher, the maintenance man­
ager of 18 Dewitt Street, the rep­
resentative informed me that as of 
January, Beecher was no longer an 
employee at Ocean Management. 
In May, the representative said 
they could not comment on indi­
vidual properties or ongoing legal 
cases.

The Second Exile
By April of this year, the Naqib­
zois had moved to their third home 
since arriving in the United States, 
a 
recently-constructed, 
afford­
able-housing complex, still close to 
their children’s K-8 school. Amila 
and Navid successfully applied for 
a unit there. It is clean and safe and 
the rent was slightly cheaper. 


Erin Nozetz, the Lead Task 
Force director, recalled asking a 
social worker with a poisoned cli­
ent at the hospital about what could 
fix the lead contamination crisis: 
“She said, ‘if I could wave a wand, 
affordable housing.’” Median rent 
in New Haven has risen sharply, 
and getting off the waitlist for a 
Section 8 housing voucher, along­
side about eighteen thousand oth­
ers in line, can take seven to ten 
years. “Where do you go?” Nozetz 
asked.


I spoke with Alice Rosenthal, 
the director of Yale-New Haven 
Hospital’s 
medical-legal 
part­
nership, about the impact of the 
city’s lackluster prevention poli­
cies on vulnerable families. After I 
described the case of the Naqibzois 
to her, she was silent for a moment. 
“That’s terrible,” she said. “You’re 
leaving a kid in a home that’s 
incredibly vulnerable to further 
permanent damage for their brain. 
That’s egregious.” Yet account­
ability for affected families may

prove elusive. Rosenthal explained 
that families who learn about lead 
contamination later, from a past 
apartment, have little to no hope 
for a successful lawsuit, especially 
if they cannot prove where their 
child was first poisoned.


Advocates hope that H.B. 5045, 
which passed the Connecticut 
House on May 3rd with the sup­
port of the governor, will tighten 
the state’s threshold of “actionable” 
lead levels in children to match 
the CDC’s newest standard, at 
3.5 micrograms per deciliter. As 
the House debated the bill, New 
Haven’s leadership on lead since 
the settlement was cited as a pos­
itive. Mayor Justin Elicker has 
maintained a stricter standard for 
investigating lead cases since his 
election in 2020. But Connecti­
cut is just the beginning—and 
legislation does not always imply 
enforcement. New Haven is an 
“improvement upon other cities,” 
Brown and Nozetz say. But these 
improvements haven’t met the 
needs of families like the Naqib­
zois.


Maritza Bond, the current direc­
tor of New Haven’s Health Depart­
ment and the person who received 
the Naqibzois’ case files by email, 
has also expressed support for the 
bill. She announced her candi­
dacy for Connecticut Secretary 
of State last March. As she con­
sidered a run in September, 2021, 
Bond said, “I’ve led New Haveners 
through one of the worst moments 
in human history, while tackling 
long-standing, unanswered issues 
like lead poisoning in our infants 
and children.” 


When Bond was hired as Direc­
tor in January 2020, after leading 
Bridgeport’s Public Health depart­
ment for three years, she made 
lead poisoning a major priority. 
The reason so many lead abate­
ments appear in public records at 
all, some have argued, is because 
of Bond’s updated procedures, 
digital record-keeping, and newly 
hired lead inspectors—including 
Joy Waldron-Clouden. Even Amy 
Marx, who closely observed the 
city’s reforms after the class-action 
lawsuit, was impressed.


In July 2020, Bond blamed the 
city’s COVID-19 shutdown for 
delays in identifying young chil­
dren with lead poisoning. From 
mid-March to early June, she told 
the New Haven Register, the Health 
received 
no 
new 
reports of high lead levels because 
“there was a delay in routine chil­
dren’s care.” Naz’s case, however, 
began in November 2019, well 
before the shutdown. While the 
city’s first inspection delay in 2020 
could conceivably be explained by 
the pandemic, the Health Depart­
ment had lab evidence of her home’s 
contamination for months after 
in-person inspections and home 
visits resumed. Marx guesses that 
the delays were due to the “period 
of transition” for Mayor Elicker’s 
administration, which had to close 
an overload of lead poisoning cases 
left from the Harp administration. 
Even so, the Naqibzois’ case is 
“totally unacceptable,” Marx said. 
“But not unexpected.”


Rosenthal points to Massachu­
setts, where tenants must receive 
a property’s lead contamination 
history before signing a lease, or 
the District of Columbia, where 
inspectors have broader authority 
to assess any houses where chil­
dren are living, as more preventive 
models for lead poisoning. “But 
that’s really it, across the country,” 
Rosenthal said. “Generally, we’re 
being very reactive.” Landlords, 
insurers, and the lead paint industry 
have successfully fought lawsuits 
and lobbied on the state and federal 
level against greater protections. In 
Connecticut, health departments 
have even pushed back against the 
more stringent standards in H.B. 
5045, protesting that it presents an 
undue burden on inspectors and 
officials. Rosenthal scoffed at that 
idea. “These are children—this is 
children’s development!” she said. 
“I’m not even understanding why 
this is a conversation. How many 
kids do we have to poison before 
we take this seriously?”

Recently, I joined the Naqibzois 
as they broke the day’s fast at sun­
down. It was Ramadan, and Naz 
was preparing to start kindergarten 
the next fall at the school across the 
street. As we sat on long maroon 
couches, trading flatbread, dishes 
of beans with lemon, pakora frit­
ters, and vegetable samosas, Navid 
described his past annual vacations 
to Afghanistan. Each time, he tried 
to bring a gift to the friend who 
had helped him with his SIV appli­
cation in 2016. But with the Tal­
iban’s takeover, the vacations are 
no longer possible, and his friend 
is still in the country. I asked 
whether the family had any way of 
contacting him, and Navid shook 
his head. “I can’t reach him. I don’t 
even have his email anymore.” 


Amila and Navid were optimistic 
about their children’s new begin­
nings, but dispatches from Khost 
were difficult not to think about. 
As foreign aid evaporated, and 
their friends reported “no salaries, 
no food, no money,” Navid tried 
to budget $550 each week and 
wire it to his parents in Afghani­
stan. He did not know whether to 
expect to see them again. 


After dinner, Amila and Navid 
packed away the leftover flatbread 
for tomorrow’s 4 a.m. pre-sun­
rise meal. Shahid and his younger 
brother deciphered the paperwork 
required for Naz’s entry into kin-
