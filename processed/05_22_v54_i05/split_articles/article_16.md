Yale professors view him as the angel of death, Sam 
Burton jokes, because he visits them before they die to 
relieve them of their literary treasures. As the owner 
of Grey Matter Books, he is not just a bookseller, 
but a master collector for his customers. His search 
for fresh, intriguing books often means waking up at 
the crack of dawn, scouring trunks at estate sales, and 
traversing the state to poke around in long forgot­
ten collections. It can lead him anywhere: recently, 
he found himself fishing for books in the wine cellar 
of a man who “supposedly killed his wife…and then 
committed suicide.” 

Burton has worked as a book buyer for thirty years. 
He started at the Strand in New York City, where he 
jokes that you could get a job “if you knew who Vir­
ginia Woolf was.” From the Strand, Burton moved to 
San Francisco and finally to Powell’s in Portland, Ore­
gon. After an interlude selling books online, which 
was “lonely and alienating,” Burton established two 
bookstores of his own, hoping to recapture an inti­
macy with surrounding communities that bookstores 
like the Strand and Powells have lost since becoming 
national empires. The first Grey Matter is in Hadley, 
Massachusetts, and the second is on York Street, nes­
tled within the imposing shadow of Sterling Memo­
rial Library. 

The harm that the internet has done to brick-and-
mortar bookstores is well-known. But they still exist, 
argues Paul Freedman, a professor and food histo­
rian at Yale, because algorithms such as Amazon’s are 
“laughable”—they will never replicate the experience 
of browsing. “The whole point is to emerge from the 
store with something you hadn’t been looking for,” 
he says. On a recent trip through New England, he 
and his wife happened upon a small used bookstore 
with a large collection of community cookbooks—
recipes assembled and bound by small communities 
to give to friends and record important dishes. Freed­
man took home the “Rolls Royce Club Cookbook,” 
a cookbook created by members of a car club. The 
rigid categories and subcategories of online stores and 
research databases, Freedman speculates, would have 
made it near impossible to find something so unique.

“I don’t lament as many things as other people do,” 
Freedman insists. Freedman has faith that books are 
not like vinyl, destined to become vintage relics. He 
believes the internet’s ability to categorize material 
will never replace the feeling of browsing for used 
books or scouring through archives—what Freedman 
calls “the thrill of the chase.”

Burton embodies this nonchalant optimism about 
the fate of the used book. He does not romanticize the 
book trade. There are no signs in Grey Matter implor­
ing customers to support struggling used bookstores. 
“I don't feel that missionary about really anything,” 
Burton says. “The only thing I feel strongly about is 
having enough cheap books…you can get a copy of 
Dante for $3, or Homer for less than the price of a 
sandwich across the street,” he reminds me. “Mine are 
always cheaper than [Amazon's].”

But Burton’s model is also not driven by pure eco­
nomic efficiency. Most used books are “garbage any­
way, or they’re just kind of bland, or common,” he 
says, referring to the quickly recycled popular fiction 
that you will never see in Grey Matter. Instead, he lets 
his own tastes and growing sensibility for the com­
munity’s preferences drive his book buying and shape 
the store’s selection. He has found that his taste is usu­
ally “positively reinforced” by his customers, but he 
also takes notes about our literary preferences. “The 
hunger for classics, for Latin stuff, Greek stuff [in 
New Haven] is pretty much bottomless,” he reports. 
Henry James books seem to fly off the shelves, but “I 
can go a month without selling a Henry James book 
at the other store. And you take note.”

While I was interviewing Burton, he reached back 
and pulled out a book of sonnets by Raymond Que­
neau, sliced into horizontal strips to invite the reader 
to make their own poems in various permutations. 
“This is something that, in a way, I hope I don’t sell, 
cause I think I like having it around.” Burton bought 
the book from a convicted forger, he reports with a 
grin. “Luckily that one was not signed.” For now, 
the book sits on the back wall above the check-out 
counter. “There’s a lot of stuff that I like having, that 
I’m not in a big hurry to sell, although after a couple 
of years, I’ll either take it home or I’ll mark it down 
and actually price it to sell.” 

From a perch amongst the unruly stacks of recent 
acquisitions, a boisterous voice chimed in. “Sam is a 
pioneer!” exclaimed Jay Gitlin, a Senior Lecturer in 
American History at Yale, and a regular at Grey Mat­
ter. For him, browsing is therapeutic. It’s a chance to 
discover new ideas that hadn’t occurred to him and 
hold a piece of communal history from the collections 
of Yale scholars. He is grateful to Burton for helping 
keep print culture alive and encourages his students 
to buy paper copies of the books he assigns from Grey 
Matter whenever possible. While he does lament the 
passage of many used bookstores that used to line the 
streets of New Haven during his undergraduate days, 
he sees Burton and Grey Matter as “the forefront of a 
changing of the guard.” 

According to Freedman, there used to be a book 
buyer from West Virginia who specialized in buy­
ing out the collections of aging Yale professors, and 
it seems that Burton has largely taken over that role. 
Burton reserves the slim shelf facing York Street for 
the collections of late professors—a sort of literary 
gravestone. Rather than distributing these books by 
subject throughout the store, he keeps the collections 
intact and affixes a sign with the name of the pro­
fessor. “My concerns are always more about getting 
books than selling them,” Burton muses. In recent 
years, he has acquired books from the collections of 
renowned scholars including Geoffrey Hartman and 
Immanuel Wallerstein.

“People like me are desperate to get rid of books…I 
can’t bring these books home,” Freedman tells me, 
pointing to his office shelves. “These aren’t particu­
larly valuable. I’m not going to live in my old age 
with books piled on the floor everywhere.” This is 
the golden age of book collecting, Freedman claims, 
because there is little demand for the books being dis­
carded. 

Burton’s trips to appraise collections and buy books 
from people who are getting older and starting to 
downsize are often “intense and personal,” he reflects. 
Freedman went through this process with his parents 
when they passed away ten years ago; he could not 
keep all of their books, and instead sold them off as a 
collection to an estate liquidator. “They were unsell­
able…I wonder what they did with the 90 percent of 
stuff [that has] no commercial value.” Burton’s pro­
cess is similar: he remembers purchasing four thou­
sand books from the collection of J. Hillis Miller, a 
member of the Yale school of deconstructionist lit­
erary critics. Burton estimated that four hundred of 
them would sell. 

Part of what keeps the community coming back to 
Grey Matter is a chance to inherit books from thinkers 
like Miller. The selection of the store takes its shape 
from the collections that Burton purchases. Even­
tually, he says, he will bring many of these books—
including an inscribed Edward Said—out of storage. 
“I’ve had this long standing plan to have a second rare 
book case that will be more focused on the history of 
ideas, [but] IKEA has been out of this cabinet for two 
years. So that’s, that’s horrible.” 

Walking into Grey Matter, I gravitate towards the 
massive philosophy section at the center of the store. 
Burton studied philosophy as an undergraduate and 
wanted the subject to have a prominent place in his 
sanctuary. I glance around to see what’s new: the 
shelves at Grey Matter look completely different from 
week to week. This week, there’s a beautiful hard­
cover set of Montaigne’s complete essays. Its colorful 
dust jacket and thin but sturdy pages are tempting. 
Do I really need to spend $15 on this right now? It’s 
a completely reasonable price, but I set it back down 
and decide to wait a few days. The next time I return, 
it’s already been sold. I am not disappointed: I am 
confident another will crop up before long. 

Burton has dedicated his life to wading through 
this literary labyrinth—to chasing and searching and 
bringing the books worth saving to a community 
with a seemingly endless desire for them. “I’m always 
at least trying to guess what is going to mean some­
thing to people around here,” Burton reflects. As I 
browse my way through Grey Matter and assemble 
my own collection, I know that thanks to Burton, 
I am inheriting from a grand collection built from 
those who came before me.
