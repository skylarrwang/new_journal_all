THE  NEW  JOURNAL
disabled creators, asexual creators, transgender cre­
ators, and creators of color.

For as long as people have been creating them, 
zines have been a communal medium. As a zine cre­
ator myself, I have grown used to connecting on all 
levels with other creators, circulating my magazines 
by trading back and forth with other creators, giv­
ing a piece of myself in return for a small window 
into another worldview. Zines at Yale, though, are all 
the more complicated. Thousands of pieces of paper 
memorabilia are held in Yale’s Queer Zines, Maga­
zines, and Newspapers Collection. The archive is vast 
and varied. I was touched by handwritten love notes 
on the backside of sepia stained photographs—decla­rations of queer vulnerability and longing are all the 
more painful when confined to vignettes. I was almost 
embarrassed reading Brat Attack, a 1993 black, white, 
and red comic newsletter that was full of visual and 
textual imagery, sparing no details about the experi­
ence of queer femme sex and bondage. The last zine 
I explored was the best: the words of Allison Wolfe 
of the femme punk band Bratmobile in the zine Girl 
Germs, examining what it means to be “punk” and 
writing, “We should really think about and talk about 
what punk means to us and who we really are and 
what kind of privilege (or lack of) we come from.”

Yet, as someone familiar with both the history and 
present face of zine culture, it was troubling to visit 
the archive room. Why were they even there? Zines 
have always been deeply intertwined with their cre­
ators and their zine communities, and in the folders of 
a Yale archival collection, even the most lively expres­
sions of alternative, progressive culture are reduced to 
inert records. The troubled yet important history of 
collectivity that they represent is completely tucked 
away in the recesses of an institution which, for a lot 
of people, represents the same status quo that contrib­
uted to their exclusivity. 

In 1989, the Yale Police Department arrested activ­
ist Bill Dobbs for hanging posters in Yale Law School 
to spread awareness of AIDS care groups in New 
Haven. Many artists and prominent figures of zine 
culture died of AIDS, largely due to the negligence 
and homophobia of powerful institutions. In fact, less 
than a year after Dobbs’ arrest, the artist Keith Har­
ing died due to complications with AIDS. Now, just 
a few decades later, how we are supposed to accept 
that Haring’s work is sitting in a collection of archives 
owned by an institution that perpetuated queer vio­
lence durning his lifetime? Bikini Kill, probably the 
most lastingly popular zine of the Riot Grrrl move­
ment sits closed, untouchable, behind a glass case as 
part of an exhibition called Points of Contact, Points of 
View. With or without the glass, as long as they are 
tucked away in little folders, we will never confront 
them as part of a living history.

On campus, as marginalized students carve spaces 
for themselves that prioritize inclusivity and accessi­
bility, zines have found their place. I am drawn most 
to a zine on campus called DOWN Mag. Lighthearted 
listicles are an important aspect of their content, such 
as one example entitled “Nonhuman Characters That 
We All Know Are Black,” which includes Marceline 
the Vampire Queen from Adventure Time as well as all 
of the penguins from Happy Feet. But they also pro­
duce more serious pieces, such as their call to “Abolish 
Directed Studies,” on account of its serving as “a vehi­
cle committing violent acts of intellectual privileging 
against marginalized groups at Yale.” I spoke with 
staff writer Anaiis Rios-Kasoga ’25 (she/her) about her 
experience writing for DOWN. 

“DOWN is the only on-campus publication that 
only publishes things written by people of color and 
for people of color, so that is really cool,” says Rios-
Kasoga. “Our main goal is just to highlight commu­
nity and culture voices that don’t find an outlet at 
most other publications at Yale.”

Rios-Kasoga was drawn to DOWN for its grass­
roots nature—writing for the magazine didn’t feel like 
working for a distant institutional force, like journal­
ism at Yale often has a tendency to feel. “[We] don’t 
have a classic editorial structure that most print mag­
azines have. We are just a board of directors, there is 
no editor-in-chief—there is on paper, but it doesn’t 
operate like that.” Rios-Kasoga will serve as the arts 
and culture editor for DOWN next fall, and she hopes 
to continue using the platform to communicate her 
experiences as a woman of color, as DOWN contin­
ues to be a space for collectivity and communication 
for students of color navigating Yale’s many tumults.

Zines are collectiveness distilled into its purest 
form. They are objects of communication, self-sus­
taining pieces of art, and personal declarations of one’s 
right to own and express their perspective. As both a 
creator and a consumer, I am moved by their power. 
After speaking with Hasselmo and immersing myself 
in New Haven’s zine culture—past and present—I 
am left certainly with more questions than answers, 
but also with the overwhelming desire to keep creat­
ing. Personal creativity, I am beginning to learn, has 
the power to open dialogues and doors that are long 
overdue to be unbarred.
