their last memory of the deceased. 

But West Haven Funeral Home, 
despite its name, is fundamentally 
a family business. When Celia 
cannot take care of it anymore, her 
father’s business will be, despite all 
her efforts keeping it alive, as dead 
as my own father’s.

Then comes the ultimate ago­
nizing question: why do we try? 
Why do we try so hard to keep 
something alive, knowing that 
it will eventually die? If death is 
inevitable, how should one go? 
When Celia prepares a body for 
an open-casket wake, she does it 
so that the family remembers only 
the beautiful ending, not the ugly 
thing leading up to death—be it 
traffic accident or overdose, an act 
of violence or a long, painful, dis­
ease. But Celia has no one to turn 
to when her business dies, some­
one like her to make everything 
neat and clean and hide away the 
ugliness behind flowers and cos­
metics. Instead, there are two big 
funeral 
corporations, 
Carriage 
Funeral and Service Corporation 
International, which have been 
conducting “cluster business” for 
a while—joined businesses with 
shared staff and shared equipment 
in a certain region. Both trade on 
the stock exchange. “They go into 
an area and saturate it,” Celia tells 
me. And they are saturating Con­
necticut. One has already acquired 
a family-owned funeral home in 
West Haven, to pair with another 
in Milford. Celia knows the end­
ing. She tries not to think about it. 
She is good at compartmentaliz­
ing, after all.

Nine years ago, Celia worked on 
a series of funerals for the children 
killed in the Sandy Hook Elemen­
tary School shooting. She heard 
the news right after her office’s 
in-house Christmas party and 
immediately decided to drive up 
to Newtown where the school is 
located to visit Daniel Honan, the 
only funeral director in town. For 
some reason she felt that she had to 
be there, the same way she felt that 
she had to take over her father’s 
business. When Honan saw her, 
he recognized her as the late Nello 
J. Pinzi’s daughter, and asked her 
if she needed any help. “I came to 
help you,” Celia responded.

She was the first to help. Others 
followed. Soon, a circle of funeral 
directors nearby set up a tempo­
rary command station at Honan’s 
funeral home, and they divided 
the work. Celia took the bodies of 
three children back to West Haven 
Funeral Home and embalmed 
them before bringing them back 
to Newtown. “They needed so 
much reconstruction for the fam­
ilies to view them,” she said. “I was 
exceedingly aware that these were 
babies, that these were little kids. 
And why is it different from any 
child?”

“It was twenty of them. That’s 
what’s surreal.”

At the command station, there 
were always at least two people 
working together at a time, and 
people took turns when they felt 
that they couldn’t continue the 
work anymore. Every once in a 
while, Celia held hands with the 
other funeral directors, encourag­
ing each other that they still had 
everything under control. Fam­
ilies came; state troopers came; 
the media came; President Obama 
came. Celia did not know about 
Obama’s attendance because she 
deliberately avoided the news. A 
few reporters attempted to inter­
view Celia, asking her if she had 
any comments. “And sometimes I 
would say, I just don’t, I’m—I’m 
overwhelmed. And I’m speech­
less. I don’t know what to say,” she 
remembered. Finally, all the bod­
ies were restored, dressed, finger­
printed so jewelry could be made 
with prints, set up for viewing, 
sent to church services and even­
tually to cemeteries or crematories. 
The work was done.

Celia told me about her work 
with the children from Sandy 
Hook nine years to the day after 
the shooting happened. It had been 
almost a decade, yet what happened 
had never left her. I asked her what 
made her carry on, both with her 
work there and with her work 
after that. Celia acknowledged 
that it was partially the humanity 
and empathy she saw among the 
funeral directors and helpers, and 
the overflows of anonymous let­
ters, flowers, and gifts sent to every 
service. But, being Celia, she also 
felt a duty to carry on. “Again, my 
compartmentalization,” she said. 
“This is what I need to do.”

On my last visit to the West 
Haven 
Funeral 
Home, 
Celia 
was supervising two temporary 
employees as they loaded a van 
with bodies to be cremated. I stood 
in the hallway while the men hur­
ried around, carrying at least half-
a-dozen caskets to the van. One of 
them, wearing a faded baseball cap 
and smelling of tobacco, asked me 
to step aside so he could remove 
another body from the prep room. 
I stepped into the slightly hazy 
afternoon sun. The van was right 
in front of me. It was filled with 
caskets, mostly simple, resembling 
cardboard boxes. It was hard to 
imagine that each cardboard box 
contained a person who had once 
walked the surface of this planet. 
In this dying business, there is a lot 
of burning to be done.
