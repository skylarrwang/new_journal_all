' 
n the gloomy sub-basements of Yale 
Medical's Brady Building, hallways 
snake beneath exposed industrial pip- · 
ing past stacks of cardboard boxes labeled 
"TOXIC: HUMAN WASTE." The temper-
ature begins to drop as I near Room 37, 
where a man in a lab coat with a thick 
Russian accent asks me what I'm doing 
"down here." I push my way through two 
stainless steel doors and it becomes clear 
why he asked: this is not a place often wan-
dered upon. 
Room 37 is the Yale Morgue the first 
stop for anyone who expires at Yale-New 
• 
Haven 
Hospital. 
Art Belanger, 
the 
morgue's manager -a giggly man who 
recalls the sea captain of the Tintin 
comics-calls the bodies he autopsies his 
"patients.'' He wears a sweater to work and 
· keeps a jug of methyl butane on an upper 
shelf, next to his motorcycle helmet. His 
office is small, windowless and lined with 
hundreds of boxes of Fluidshield surgical 
masks and Safeskin purple· nitrate gloves. 
In the comer stands a file cabinet straight 
out of the Twilight Zone: there must be 
over 300 miniature drawers labeled "Old 
Autopsy Files." 
The main function of the morgue is to 
store a body until the funeral director picks 
it up, or, in the case of twenty percent of 
Yale Hospital deaths, to perfonn an autop-
sy. Belanger and his crew do 230 autopsies 
every year on patients whose deaths are 
investigated either by the request of a doc-
tor, family member, or in the case of sus-
picious circumstances-"If it's an untimely 
death[] like accidents, homicides, etc. Then 
the state has the right not only to investi-
gate but to order an autopsy," says 
Belanger. 

Within the morgue, dark hallways feed 
into two sterile laboratories, each with two 
metal tables in the center of the rooms. 
The first table, scooped out like a bowl to 
contain and then drain the fluids, is where 
the technicians unload the body. The sec-
ond flat table displays a row of glinting 
surgical instruments along its left-hand 
side. "That's where we'll put the organs 
when we remove them," he says quickly, 
before walking to the second laboratory, 
where Maxwell-a graying, soft-spoken doc-
tor in a getup right out of Yi>ttng 
Frankenstein hoses dark, clotted blood into 
the drain. "He's just cleaning up from an 
autopsy of a fetus this mouain~" Art says, 
. 
and Maxwell nods. I shiver. This is not 
something I want to see. 
Though death has been conveniently 
concealed in the sub-basements of the 
morgue, packed in boxes stuck with neon 
stickers, and barricaded behind steel doors, 
it is no less real. I finger a small white card 
in my back pocket, and know what it says 
without reading: "My body has been donat-
ed to YALE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF 
MEDICINE," it proclaims. 
There was a 
blank for my signature. I signed. When I 
called the Body Donation Network a few 
weeks ago, the secretary on the other end of 
the line asked me out of curiosity how old 
I was. My voice must have sounded young 
over the phone. "Nineteen?" she asked, 
again. "You're crazy." Maybe she's right. 
If everything goes according to plan, 
someday I will be lying here. Forget million 
dollar bequests, football fields and fellow-
ship grants. Giving ·a dead corpse to your 
alma mater is the most generous donation 
possible. 

I have chosen to donate my body 
"whole," which means it will be wheeled 
upstairs to the anatomy labs to help med~ 
ical students learn the Greek vocabulary for 
my insides. But if I really want my body 
donated to science, Art explains, I had bet-
ter pray I don't need an autopsy. "Medical 
doesn't accept autopsied bodies for dona-
tion," he explains, "because in autopsy aU 
the organs are removed, which is exactly 
what Medical students are going to want to 
do with their donated cadavers." 

Behind the autopsy lab, in a stuffy 
sideroom, these organs sit cooped up in 
plastic beach pails. Some are labeled "breast 
tissue," others "heart." Near a sink, three 
medical students are working quickly. 
"Today is brain cutting day," Art says. 
There's a bread knife on the counter and a 
blonde medical student named Amanda is 
laying banana-bread-thick slices of human 
brain onto numbered cookie trays lined 
with formaldehyde-soaked p~r towels . 
The numbers on the trays stand for 
patients: 212,213, 215. Art notes that 214 is 
missing. "It's standard to take out the brain 
in an autopsy, so maybe the family of 
patient 214 requested to restrict the autop-
sy to only the diseased organs. They didn't 
want anyone messing with what wasn't nee-
essary. " 

There's a pervading fear that tamper-
ing with the dead hurts them in some way. 
THE NEW joURNAL 


Today, these brains will be 
seen by a neurologist scanning 
for brain disease. What the 
doctor finds may further med-
ical science, and the brains 
themselves may enter . class-
rooms as examples to live for 
years in glass jars on distant 
upper shelves. But the missing 
brain of patient 214 can go 
only two ways: it will be 
buried or burnt. 

Though my body may 
never go through an autopsy 
a~d my· organs may go uncut, 
the little white card in my 
pocket ensures that I will end 
up here, on a gurney in the 
last room in Art's tour. 
Welcome to the freezer. Just 
above the do9r, a large button 
is twice label~d, "Emergency 
Release." I'm glad about the 
button, because I would not 
want to be stuck here. Art 
agrees. Though about 1200 
bodies come through this room every year, 
today there are only two-an amputated left 
leg of an Orthodox Jewish man wrapped up 
in a trash bag ("the Orthodox Jews believe 
our bodies must be buried whole, so a 
funeral director will keep it for twenty years 
or so until the poor guy dies"). There's also 
something bright in the other corner of the 
room. Motioning toward the pale body bag, 
Art says, "She's been here a month. No 
one's come to claim her yet," and then 
shakes his head. "It's my nightmare that 
that should happen to me, and I tell it to all 
the doctors upstairs. They know if I go, to 
come pick me up." 

Though it is a regular question in bis 
business, Art hasn't decided whether he 
wants to end up like his patients. "Really, 
I'm tom between three things," he says. 
"Whether I should have an autopsy, 
whether I should donate it to science, or-" 
he lingers, "whether I should just be cre-
mated and left alone." Most people choose 
to be "left alone." Even pathologists-who 
benefit directly from the knowledge accrued 
during autopsies-are not immune to the 
fear that maybe there is something disre-
spectful about disturbing the dead In the 
morgue, workers are superstitious, careful, 
scared-because in the "business of death" 
as they call it, death never really becomes a 
NoVEMBER 2004 

Ultimately, however, the route of our 
afterlives is not only ours to map. "It's real-
ly what the family decides," Art explains. 
'~If a donor has a card that says they'd like 
to donate their body to science, and the 
family says no, Yale is not going to go 
against the family. It's just not worth it for 
the University." If my family goes along 
with my decision, I will be part of the "very 
.small percent" of those who Art carts 
directly from the freezer to the s-econd 
floor, across the elevated walkway to 300 
Cedar Street-the heart of the. Yale School 
of Medicine and the home of Yale's 
Anatomy Department. 

he Anatomy Department both is 
and is not as I envisioned it. There 
is a predictably stark white hallway 
that seems to extend infinitely, but then 
again, amateur watercolor landscapes hang 
on the wall because someone who donated 
money to the department thought it 
looked "too sterile." True: there is a real 
skeleton peeping out from a comer, and a 
display of x-ray photographs; but there's 
also ·a homey quilt sewn by last year's 
anatomy class as a departing gift to their 
"donors." In the anatomy department, 
Art's "patients" become "donors." The 
word choice is deliberate. These people

chose to end up here. These corpses carried 
the card. 

The lucky finder of a body with a 
donor card is asked to telephone Yale's 
"Anatomy Mortician." The voice on the 
other end of the line belongs to Phil Lapre, 
a smiley people-person who got his training 
at New York's Bellevue morgue at the peak 
of the AIDS epidemic. Today, he hands out 
caramel candies to anyone who enters his 
office and keeps framed photos of his two 
daughters · on an upper · shelf. Though his 
geniality seems out of place in this morbid 
profession, it's practically in the job 
description. As the anatomy morti<;ian, he 
is the first contact for anyone even vaguely 
considering full b<;>dy-donation. "We speak 
to donors if they have any questions, pro-
vide them with paperwork, give them coun-
sel." Phil tells potential donors as much as 
they'd like to know, stressing that donors 
are never recruited. "None of the people 
who donate to Yale are solicited. They come 
of their own volition and fill out the paper-
work that you received." But donors can 
always change their minds. The filing cabi-
nets pushed against every wall guard the 
paperwork of the undead who signed on 
but may never show up. 

For those who stick to their decision, 
Phil is also the first contact for the grieving 
family of the loved one who has wiJJed her

When a body is accepted for donation, 
it is wheeled up to the Anatomy Morgue-
affiliated with Yale School of Medicine. 
Here, no funeral homes are telephoned; no 
family members need to identify the 
corpse. This is the workroom where Phil 
prepares the bodies not' for display, but for 
dissection. 

For the fifty or so donors who come in 
every year, Phil's job is to keep them look-
ing as fresh as the day they arrived. 
Through a cut in the neck, a tube attached 
to a vat of formaldehyde runs a formalin 
solution through the donot:'s veins. Once 
the corpse is sufficiently saturated, the body 
stays in a freezer with fifty bedfellows until 
a day in August, when it will be wheeled out 
to the lab and studied by hundreds of sets 
of eyes. 

t is late August: One-hundred first-year 
medical students shuffle into a large 
amphitheater where they are greeted by. 
Dr. Bill Stewart and Dr. Lawrence Rizzolo, 
the two lead professors of first-year anato-
my-an academically and emotionally chal-
lenging class regarded as a Med school rite 
of passage. On the first day, the students 
don't 
dissect. 
Instead, 
they become 
"acquainted" with the donor they will soon 
dismantle. Most medical students approach 
the bodies with a chilling, robotic respect-
perhaps the donors expected as much. 
But donors probably didn't expect to 
be viewed by another brand of student 
entirely-over-eager sixteen-year-olds from 
Career High School-a public science mag-
net made up of mostly inner-city kids. They 
have never seen a dead body before. And, 
up until today, neither have I. 

It's no coincidence that the table in the 
center of the amphitheater in the Hope 
Medical building is the perfect size to curl 
up and nap on. This hall is modeled after 
old operation theaters, and the table was 
designed to hold the cadaver undergoing 
dissection. That's probably why Dr. Bill 
Stewart has chosen this room to speak to 
eighteen Career High School students and 
me. We are a fidgety audience. "Years ago," 
he says, motioning to an invisible corpse, 
"they would have been homeless people or 
criminals who didn't want to be dissected." 
Our ears perk up. 

Eighty years ago, the dead bodies that 
ended up here did not sign consent forms 
when they were living, and may not have 
I been so pleased to be plucked apart. 
In 
1824, when the grave of a 19-year-old West 
Haven resident, Bathsheba Smith was 
found plundered, angry townspeople point-
ed their pitchforks accusingly at the 
Medical School, then located at the inter-
section of Grove and Prospect Streets· where 
the SSS building sits today. Yale anatomy 
students had indeed stolen the body, just as 
they had stolen others before, and when 
Smith's corpse was found hastily reburied 
in the basement of the Medical School, 
New Haveners were furious. Fearful for 
their lives, anatomy students barricaded 
themselves in the medical building, while 
protestors outside pelted the windows with 
burning chunks of coal. Today Dr. Stewart 
assures us that the situation couldn't be 
more different than the "Dissection Riot of 
1824." 

"All the people upstairs donated 
their bodies," he emphasizes. "They would 
be excited to know . that people like you 
were looking at them." 

From a few rows behind, nervous whis-
pering signals that its time to go to the lab. 
"Are you feeling okay?" a·med student asks 
a girl who is on her way out. 
"Oh, yeah," she says. "Dead people just 
make me feel great." 
"Well, they're better that way," the stu-
dent assures her. "They can't do anything." 

Moving through the same hall-
ways that . the bodies travel from the 
morgue, Doctor Stewart, bubbling with 
excitement, asks me, as an aside, "Have you 
seen a body before?" The rest of the stu-
dents here have had to fill out waivers. 
"Nope," I say. 
"Are you ready?" 

ear the waistline of my labcoa4 a 
bloodstain runs in a perfect line. A 
medical student at the door of the 
classroom hands out masks, though Doctor 
Stewart doesn't take one. At firs4 I follow 
Stewart's lead. But the student warns me, 
"You're going to want this when you smell 
it." Gloves are also a necessity. One hun-
dred years ago, approximately one medical 
student in each graduating class would die 
from infection from the cadaver-a hand cut 
with a scalpel exposed to the cadaver's dis-
-
eased flesh would immediately result in 
infection. Putting the gloves and mask 
on, a tall boy turns to the girl on his left, 
and says excitedly, "This is just like 
E.R.," referring, of course, to the TV 
show, 
not 
hospital wing. 

Above the sink in the classroom 
there is a selection of tools-a bone saw 
for getting through the skull, a hammer 
and chisel for separating the segments of 
spinal cord. A table is covered with boxes 
of gloves, suture needles, sandwich bags 
for storing removed organs, flashlights 
for peering into dark spaces and, against 
the wall, red buckets to collect excess 
skin, which will later be incinerated. In 
the center of the room are three rows of 
four metal boxes that serve as temporary 
caskets. 

We separate into groups: four high 
schoolers, two med students, and one 
dead body. We are told by Dr. Stewart to 
"use the buddy system, and look out for 
each other." My buddy is Jonathan, an 
enthusiastic medical student who later 
blushes when he talks about the body of · 
a woman with a "third nipple." I'm glad 
he's watching out for me: "It can be a lit-
tle upsetting," Dr. Stewart assures us. "If 
you feel a little upset, leave the room and 
take a break." I've heard that the first 
dead body you see changes your life. 

In this momen4 I am waiting for 
my life to change. Two students, one on 
each end, unsnap the locks of the case 
and heave its lid open. All I can see is a 
mess of paper towels. It reminds me of 
my brother as a child-his favorite hide-
and-seek position was to wrap himself in 
bed sheets and lay splayed-out and still, 
trying hard not to breathe. The medical 
students uncover the body sheet by 
sheet. The skin is yellow and crumpled 
like a paper bag. We are invited to touch 
it. "It seems fake," a girl in my group 
says flatly. "It doesn't smell fake," a med 
student says. 

"It's clearly a person, but it's also 
dead," says my buddy Jonathan. "And 
it's hard to understand that." Though 
Stewart professes the body "isn't that 
messy ye4" it is pretty messy: the torso 
has been opened up like a ,car hood, and 
the ribs, brittle and yellow, lift open to a 
mass of pinks and blues. A Ziploc bag, 
oozing with pinkish water, contains the
