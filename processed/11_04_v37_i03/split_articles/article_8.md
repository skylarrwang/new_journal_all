On Guard 
IN 1966 the great 
philanthropist 
Paul 
Mellon 
donated his exten-
sive collection of British art to Yale, and in 
· 1974, the great architect Louis Kahn com-
pleted his last building, a museum to house 
that art, and ever since then, the most beau-
· 
tiful spot on Yale's campus has been the 
fourth floor of the Yale Center for British 
Art on a mellow mid-afternoon when the 
sky is nothing but blue and the sun hits the 
stone angels on the bridge over High Street 
and the city is a crazy mess of spires and 
pointed roofs jutting into the distance and 
"The Dort Packet-Boat from Rotterdam . 
Becalmed" by J.M.W. Turner shines a light 
of its own onto the sea and the city it 
depicts. 

Weekday afternoons at the YCBA are 
slow, and as I sat by this painting one 
sunny Tuesday, only a few people passed by. 
There was a couple with a baby girl 
("Look," they said to her, pointing at the . 
painting, "It's alive."). Then there were two 
glossy, gray-suited women gesturing flam-
boyantly ("Turner was a genius."), and then 
for a long time there was nobody but a 
security guard with a silver hoop in his ear. 
He was short and stocky and he darted in 
and out looking at "The Dort Packet-Boat" 
from several angles. 
Once or twice he 
swiped his hand over the painting's huge, ·· 
gold frame. "I don't know," he said into his 
radio. · "It doesn't look that bad." 

I was curious about what he was doing, 
but I didn't think I was allowed to ask. I 
had just come from the museum's "control 
room," where I spoke at length with Len 
Costanza, the head security supervisor of 
the YCBA, who had given me explicit 
instructions not to interview the security 
guards-"I don't know what they might tell 
you!" he exclaimed in mock horror before

. 
adding gravely, "We alwao/s need to be secu-
rity conscious." Len is always security con-
scious. On the bulletin board above his. 
desk he has tacked up articles about devas-
tating art heists. 
"2 Art Treasures With 
Value of At Least $200 Million Stolen!" "A 
Robbery, A Reporter, and Somewhere a 
Cellar Full of Masterpieces!" When I asked 
him if I could turn on a tape recorder, he 
squinted at me and quickly shook his head. 
Definitely not, nope. 
He couldn't allow 
himself to be recorded, "for secu.rity rea-
sons." Instead, he made a counter-offer: I 
could take notes, and he would inspect 
them. As we began to speak I mentioned 
that I come to the museum often. 
"I 
know," he said quietly. "I've seen· you." 

Len"s office is right next to the control 
room, which is not one of the most beauti-
ful spots on the Yale campus. Just a door 
· and a corridor away from the smooth, soar-
ing spaces of Kahn's museum, these walls 
are made of cinderblocks instead of paneled 
oak and crammed with television screens 
instead of paintings. There is a huge series 
of Polaroid snapshots depicting everyone 
who is authorized to enter the building. 
There is a drawing of Betty Boop. And 
then, of course, there is Len, who has been 
a constant presence here for 25 years, when 
he started as a security guard. He knows the 
place inside -and out and keeps a very close 
eye on things, but even so, a few more sets 
of eyes don't hurt. 

Tha"s why the YCBA has 35 roving 
security cameras, which, I have been 
assured, will find you wherever you are. 
The cameras are state-of-the-art: they can 
swivel around the room, follow people 
through the museum, and zoom in on 
minute details. They produce a record of 
every visitor's motions from the time he 
enters the building to the time he leaves, 
stored on a hard drive. When I visited the 
control room, a petite woman was manning 
the computers and scanning the images 
·intently. Len introduced her. "I have every 
confidence inJen here," he said. "She's seen 
things under fire. She oversees everything 
from this room. She even makes sure the 
UPS guy isn't an imposter." Jen cast a har-
ried glance at me and turned back to her six 
computer screens as they flashed from scene 
to scene. A man walked through a doorway. 
Another man walked through another 
doorway. Nothing looked particularly sus-
picious to me, but as Len pointed out sev-
eral times, the guards· at the YCBA have to 
be constantly alert, constantly ready for dis-
aster. "You have to think like this," he says. 

Len Costanza does not think or speak in 
ambiguities, because the way he sees it, . 
there are none, at least not in his line of 
work. Either the museum is secure or it is 
not. One of his favorite phrases is "we must 
always assume", as in, "we must always 
assume a fire alarm is set off in an attempt-
ed burglary," or, "we must always assume 
that someone is hiding out in the bushes 
ready to steal a painting," or simply, "we 
must always assume the worst." 

These aren't just blind assumptions 
Len knows the worst, because he has seen it. 
He still remembers the exact date and time 
of the first and last major "security inci-
dent" in YCBA history. At 9:15 on the 
morning of July 19, 1984, a guard discov-
ered something missing from the Henry 
Moore sculpture "Bird and Egg" -namely, 
the egg, which had been completely 
detached from the base and spirited away. 
The 
s~ulpture's defacement caused an 
uproar, and although the egg was returned 
11 days later (via inter-office mail, enclosed 
in a brown envelope labeled "sorry for the 
hassle"),. the memory still haunts Len, who 
keeps a manila folder full of yellowed clip-
pings about the theft. When I asked him 
about the incident, he winced Did he ever 
find out who did it? "Well, ubviously-no, I 
obviously can't say." Weii, if everything was 
secure the night before, it must have been a 
guard, right? "I can't go into it further D I 
could never say it was an inside job," he

said abruptly. "But timing-wise, it had to be 
someone who was in the building prior to 
its opening." He changed the subject. "We 
have to be in a position to prevent things 
like this from happening ever again,, he 
said emphatically. "It's almost like someone 
invaded my personal-." He stopped and 
began again. "This is our house, and we 
take so much pride in the beauty of the 
building, the Louis Kahn building, and the 
art. We takeJt personally. Somebody gets 
something robbed, the next thing they do is 
put in a whole new security system. My way 
of thinking is that we always need to be two 
steps ahead. Many times on a Sunday,- I'll 
walk this building and look for vulnerable 
places. We can't rely on luck-luck has noth-
ing to do with it-we just don't take any 
shortcuts. There's only one way to do it, 
and that's to do it right." 

Suddenly, he straightened up in his 
Aeron chair and looked me in the eye. "I 
knew Mr. Mellon-! have a signed copy of 
one of his books-and I feel I have a duty to 
live up to his treasures. If he was going to 
give his treasures to this museum, I wi).l do 
everything in my power to protect those 
treasures. He was such a wonderful man." 

When I asked him about his own favorite 
art, he had a ready answer. "I always 
admired the Stubbs paintings. I love horses, 
and I know these were Mr. Mellon's favorite 
paintings. I'm fascinated by the oldest 
paintings in the collection. How artists 
made their paints and constructed this art 
and it's still standing here 500 years later." 

He dwelt on Paul Mellon and his lega-
cy for a while, which makes sense; after all, 
these paintings are Len's to protect, and he, 
perhaps more than any other man, is 
· charged with the mission of keeping them 
intact until he chooses to pass them on to 
another protector. But his eloquence faded 
to jargony, nervous patter as I prepared to 
leave and asked if I could talk to an actual 
security guard He clammed up again and 
gave me a "no, sorry, I don't think so, secu-

rity issues," and I gave him a "thanks for 
your time" and returned to the fourth floor 
of the museum to sit by the Turner paint-
ing. I started to write and stopped again, 
acutely conscious of the 35 cameras pan-
ning the building ("I could read someone' s 
book with this camera," I remembered Len 
saying). I didn't dare speak to the guard 
with the earring, but I watched as he paced 
in and out of the room, still talking into his 
radio and eyeing "The Dort Packet-Boat." 
Eventually he returned and slid a slatted 
window shut. He looked at me apologeti-
cally-"Sorry about that, but we've gotta 
keep the sunlight off the painting, we've 
gotta protect it" -and then the room was 
darker but the painting still glowed and the 
guard moved on.
