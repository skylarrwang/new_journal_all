Weddings I Celebrations? 
by Romy Drucker 
KEVIN ABELS, ELLIOT GREENBERGER 
0RLY FRIEDMAN, ANDREW CEDAR 
Orly Friedman, daughter of Thomas and 
Anne Friedman of Bethesda, Maryland, has 
been dating Andrew Cedar, son of Phil and 
Dr. Meryl Cedar of Scarsdale, New York, 
· since the two met at a Yale College Council 
(YCC) meeting in October of 2003. Though 
the pair has been together an "unlucky" 
thirteen months, Ms. Friedman· and Mr. Cedar's forecast as a couple 
remains as auspicious as their beginnings. 


Fr~edman's interest began as an innocent crush on a Harry Potter 
look-alike. She approached Cedar with a bogus question as an excuse to . 
strike up a conversation. (Today, the conversation continues.) A few days 
later Cedar, who would soon be elected YCC President, emailed 
Friedman in true Yale fashion. "I know," he says. "It·is a little .nerdy." It 
paid off, d(!spite her roommates' original impression that he was a 
"shmuck." Mter a salsa dancing date at Berkeley. and some unconven-
tional bonding on Yom Kippur, Friedman and Cedar found themselves 
' 
in a serious relationship. 


The busy power pair-he, the executive ofYCC, she, an active mem-
ber of the Yale Student Activities Committee and United Way-enjoys 
cooking Italian delicacies in the Swing Space kitchen, puzzling over their 
Game Theory problem sets together, appreciating American art and 
challenging other couples to Trivial Pursuit. When no one is looking, . 
they may hold hands · in the Sterling Memorial Library courtyard. "New 
Haven can be romantic if you make good use of it," says Friedman. 


Although she laments the fact . that Cedar~s on-campus prominence 
"does not allow for romantic getaways," he makes up for it by being a 
good shopping partner. 


Her father is a Pulitzer Prize winning columnist. Her mother is a 
first grade reading teacher. His father, a lawyer, and his mother, a pedia-
trician, met as undergraduates at Brandeis University in Boston. Are Ms. 
Friedman and Mr. Cedar following in their parents' footsteps? 


WHITNEY SEIBEL, EDWARD HIGGINS 
The heartland of America has united two 
Yale hearts. Whitney Seibel of McPherson, 
Kansas, and Edward Higgins of Kansas City, 
Kansas, both juniors in Trumbull, have been 
together since the sparks began to fly in 
Bingham D two years ago. 


Maybe it was geography, maybe it was destiny, or maybe it was a 
capella. Some combination of the threehas kept couple in harmony. 
Seibel sings for The New Blue; Higgins is a member of the Spizzwinks?. 
But they make their best music together. "It's hard to think about plan-
ning, but we definitely want things to work out in the future," Seibel 
says, adding that the two have never taken a "break" in their three years 
at Yale. "I don't have a college experience without Eddie," she says ebul-
liently. Considering as one of his thefacebook.com "interests" is "cud-
dling," one can see why. 


Seibel, who dabbles in modeling and recently appeared in Maxim, is 
a Psychology major. Higgins majors in History. They continue to be a 
major Yale item. 


Like two ships passing in the night, 
Kevin Abels of White Plains, New Yqrk 
and Elliot Greenberger of Chicago, 
Illinois always spotted each other 
around campus. "Should I say 'hi?"' 
they each wondered at a FOOT party in 
Spring 2003, when suddenly a friend 
ushered them toward each other. It seemed like slow motion. 


But Abels and Greenberger are not a movie couple. In fact, they 
proudly "keep it· real." "Actually I'm the keep-it-realer," boasts 
Greenberger. Abels, a Literature major with a penchant for community 
organizing, and Greenberger, an English major who sings for Mixed 
Company and excels 1n dance and theater, are so busy, they are forced to 
be nocturnal lovebirds. Neither this temporal distance nor a term 
· abroad has kept them apart, and maybe nothing ever will. "I'm excited 
about that possibility," smiles Abels. 


It may be all flowers and candy for the adorable duo, but not when 
it comes to gifts. Greenberger bought Abels a wind-up ear toy to show 
his appreciation for his beau's stellar listening skills. Abels knows how 
to cheer up his partner: he can always count on a ginger ale and a sand-
wich from Gourmet Heaven to turn Greeberger's frown upside-down. 


Especially when dressed up in Liberace outfits as Siegfried and Roy, 
the couple are a fearsome twosome. The icing on the cake? The white 
Bengal beanie baby Siegfried wore on his shoulder. This couple has 
found the key to companionship. 


MICHELLE Ros 
ISAAC KLAUSNER 
Maybe Michelle Rosenthal and Isaac 
Klausner's four year relationship works 
because it started off on the right foot. 
That is, FOOT. The two weren't on the 
same trip but met for the first time on the 
train coming up to Yale. They even rode 
. 
in the same taxi to Phelps Gate. 


Destiny or lady luck? They got together on Casino Night 2001, and 
the two· Stilesians have been rolling high ever since. The best part, they 
agree, is sharing their relationship with their friends. "Last year they 
threw us a surprise anniversary party," says Rosenthal. 


'They have 
watched us evolve." They live under the same roof in a fourteen person 
house with their Stiles family, and, in fact, Klausner and Rosenthal have 
never been more than an entryway or two apart: "Yale is a place where 
we can do our own thing and still be together," says Klausn£_r. Well-con-
nected and intensely involved, she is a Dwight Hall co-coordinator; he 
is a star on the Yale Film Scene-and the self-proclaimed "first man of 
Dwight Hall." 


When they are not listening to Brazilian Jazz or reading plays 
aloud, the pair share their favorite children's books. They are writing 
one too: a fairy tale
