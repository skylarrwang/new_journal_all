THE GIORDANO BROTHERS' SHOWROOM looks like an extension of the cemetery across the street. The front lawn is lined with three rows of gravestones, some of which bear inscriptions, all arranged around a colossal granite cross as tall as the showroom itself. The scene unfolds inside, where Pat Giordano, Sr. stands amid more headstones, a portable phone pressed into his ear, as he confirms such information as the name of "the deceased"-never "the dead." He's so poised and professional that it's easy to overlook the morbidity of his business-after all, he does sell tombstones for a living. "Me, it doesn't bother," he says, walking past the headstone of Albert Marzala, June 29, 1920-August 17, 2000. "But some people get very uneasy when they come in here." As for the headstones that populate the store, most were intended for specific clients. "In thirty-five years, you make a few mistakes," he admits with a shrug of his shoulders.


Selling headstones is a touchy business. Along with undertakers and funeral directors, Pat Sr. is one of the first people to come in contact with a family after a family member has died. He says that he's had a fair number of people cry in the store. Grieving pet owners, surprisingly, are one of the most devastated groups. "You have the biggest, burliest guys come in here and break down," he says.


As far as emotional strain is concerned, Pat Sr. claims his job is far easier than that of, say, an undertaker. However, he notes that buying a headstone marks a turning point in a family's grieving process. "Some people will keep having you change little things on headstones, because that's the final gift that you can give a loved one," he says. "Once it's done, you reach a kind of closure, and some people aren't ready for that."


Currently, Pat Sr. is the only Giordano running the monument store. Once upon a time, however, it was owned by the Giordano brothers-all four of them. Pat Sr.'s grandfather founded the store along with his three brothers in 1921. It has remained at the same location across from the Yale Bowl ever since, and has subsequently been owned by Pat Sr.'s father, and now Pat Sr. himself.


Although some carving is done at the quarry in Barre, Vermont, from which Pat Sr. orders the majority of his granite, most of the tombstones are etched in a shop behind the showroom. Over the span of his career, Pat Sr. has witnessed the decline of hammer-and-chisel-carved stones and an increase in the use of more high-tech techniques like sandblasting and computer imaging. It's even possible to use computers to etch a photograph of the deceased onto a tombstone.


Beyond manufacturing headstones, Pat Sr. also has to be acutely aware of the rules and regulations governing headstones in the cemeteries where his products will end up. Each cemetery allows only headstones of certain sizes and specific materials to be placed on its grounds. Many cemeteries even have subsections with more specific rules.


Most bylaws governing headstones are of a practical nature: all Connecticut cemeteries require headstones to be made of granite, not marble, because marble erodes quickly in the local climate. Some, however, concern religious beliefs. The Catholic Cemetery Association (CCA) requires that all tombstones in their cemeteries have a certain amount of religious iconography-praying hands, large crosses, and images of saints are all strongly encouraged. Pat Sr. finds the specific percentages that the CCA dictates baffling. "We still can't figure out what the hell they're talking about," he says.


Other customers choose more secular images to rest alongside their loved ones. In particular, Pat Sr. notes that many customers have requested alcohol-related engravings-martini glasses, Manhattan glasses, even detailed Budweiser cans. "I guess they enjoyed the time they spent drinking together," he says.


For such an attention-grabbing storefront, Pat Sr. is lucky to suffer little vandalism or defacement of his property. The only incident he can recall occurred a couple of years ago when one of the headstones in front of the store disappeared in the middle of the night. "The police got a kick out of it," he says. "It was very unprofessionally done-it had to be a frat."


Technological changes aside, selling headstones seems like a relatively non-transient business: there's a steady demand for product, and little direct competition. Despite this, Pat Sr. says that he's seen business dwindle during his years in the industry. "Monuments have gotten smaller and smaller," he says. "Cemeteries have to keep sizes down-they're running out of space." He also points to young people's lack of interest in the business: "I've found that when people reach the age of retirement, no one takes over-they go out of business. I've known three places that's happened to in the past couple of years."


Nevertheless, Pat Sr. has little fear of his store following in the wake of his now-defunct competition. He's confident that when he retires, his own son, Pat Jr., who currently works alongside his father, will keep the family business alive. After all, for the Giordano's, their store is a tradition in the vein of family-run tailors and furniture stores-except, instead of inseams or ottomans, their business revolves around "the deceased."
