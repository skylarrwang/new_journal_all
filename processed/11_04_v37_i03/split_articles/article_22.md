ing the pro-life author's journey accompanying a friend to her abor-
tion, makes me wonder if some believers are actually striving for 
new depths of cruelty: Did you bother to tell her that she will have 
to face judgement for her actions someday. You have given the 
, impression that God will tolerate the murder of her child. The word 
says the truth will set you free. Your actions have placed that young 
lady into bondage. If she dies in her sins, you will bear part of the 
responsibility. 
rer wrote that knew just where to stab and twist. By 
accusing a Christian trying to emulate Christ's compas-
sion of driving someone into "bondage," the writer sug-
gests she is acting as a tool of the Devil. The completeness with 
which that statement violates· the spirit of Christ might be funny, if 
nen I arrived at the North Berkeley corner of Cross 
Campus _ on October 21, I was surprised at how 
uneventful the scene was. The position that CLAY rep-
resents is not popular at Yale. Last year, when advertising for CLAY 
events, I often revisited the same boards two or three times, to find 
that our posters had been ripped down. Still, opposition is rela-
tively tame, compared to what pro-lifers encounter elsewhere. While 
protesting at the March for Women's Lives in D.C. la.st spring, 
. Mary was confronted by a pro-choice marcher who said to her, 
"Your mother should have aborted you." Here, after CLAY mem-
bers scrawled "A person's a person, no matter how small" on the 
steps leading up to Sterling Memorial Library, I had expected to see 
at the very least some demonstration-a lone protester holding a 
' only it were fictional. 
"Stop Anti-Choice at Yale" sign, even-but the message remained 
unmarked. · 
On the other end of the spectrum, the Canadian government 
is one of the few in .the world that imposes absolutely no restric-
tions on abortion rights, a policy which has strongly influenced my 
.. country's identity. For example, my high school English teacher 
once mentioned Bush's restrictions on overseas abortion funding, 
dismissed them as dangerously conservative, then moved onto the 
· particulars of iambic pen-
tameter. In Canada, 
the 
debate over abortion is exem-
plified by the following 
exchange from the 2004 fed-
The

On the night of the vigil there was only a lonely-looking table 
stacked with literature and a cluster of people gathered at the wall 
overlooking Cross Campus Library, placing candles into paper 
bags. On the lawn, the scattered bags bore a vague resemblance to 
a cross. There was no "us vs. the world" binary here, only a two-
thousand-year-old symbol of compassion.

For a few minutes, I placed 
candles and made small talk. In

lifers as militant automatons, with 
a penchant for chanting Scripture . 
and writing death threats to 
Planned Parenthood directors, the 
truth is rather boring-namely, that 
we are creatures of human impulse. 
Talking about the mundane seems 
to be instinctual at events that 
remember the mystery of exis-
tence. I was about to ask my part-
ner about his courses when Mary 
came up to us, an apologetic smile

· women as evidence of an 
"anti-choice ideology." That 
last epithet says everything 
its attern reco niza le. 
about the prevailing ethos in 
, Canada: a woman's choice is 
the only issue at stake. Any 
concern for the organism kicking inside the womb is necessarily 
misogynistic. However proud I may be of hockey and socialism, I 
fear that being Canadian these days means embracing a philosophy 
in which humanity is denied according to personal opinion. 
Which brings me to the vigil and why I was sitting in Machine 
City folding paper bags. I have little use for the intimidation games 
many pro-lifers play-the bu ruing eye of judgment turned towards 
the women who choose abortion and the blind eye to the hardships 
facing those who do not. But it is just as difficult for me to stom-
ach the rhetoric of choice, in which pro-lifers are dismissed as exer-
cising freedom of religion instead of engaging in serious dialogue. I 
cannot accept a world where a human embryo's rights are not con-
sidered, a world that reduces a growing life to an inconvenience, a 
tumor-like tissue fit for surgical dismemberment. For me, this vigil 
was the first step in defusing a war zone. It would honor the dead 
without making murderers of pregnant women. It would also try a 
tactic that has been forgotten on most college campuses: silence. 
on her face. 
"We're starting the 
vigil soon," she said, "so I guess we 
should start keeping silence." 
"Okay," I said, flushing with 
embarrassment. As the cross of candles began to appear, the crowd 
settled into a meditative hush. The silence was short-lived, howev-
er: our memorials burst into flame, as improperly settled candles lit 
their bags on fire. The sight of CLAY members running out onto 
the field to stomp out the miniature testaments to unborn lives-
quite vehemently, in the case of the more frantic extinguishers-
must have seemed incongruous to onlookers. 
Some members 
laughed nervously, while others stared on as if they saw it as a 
melancholy symbol. The metaphorical implications, of course, 
were fodder for freshman English: the violence with which we were 
stamping out the fires was an inadvertent demonstration of the vio-
lence inflicted on the lives they symbolized. 
"Another life put out by abortion," someone said In hind-
sight, that seems horrifically trite, b_ut at the time 1 didn't know 
what to do but smile. Despite my smirking, I was profoundly irri-
tated: to simply accept our disintegrating arrangement as some kind 
of divinely orchestrated comment on the violence of abortion
