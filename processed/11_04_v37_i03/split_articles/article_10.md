A portrait of Pearson graces the wall to
the left of the reading · room ·in the library
and reveals not only his warm, intelligently
wrinkled countenance, but also his many
interests. Set in the professor's HGS study,
the painting boasts in its background the
Oxford Anthology of American Literature,
which Pearson edited with his friend
William Rose Benet. Perched next to the
Oxford anthology is Dusty Diamonds, a
"boys' book" representative of Pearson's
collection of this genre. But most striking is
a painting of a woman whose cold face con-
trasts markedly with Pearson's own: it is the
face of "Arabella," who stares out of D. H.
Lawrence's only portrait (which Pearson
owned). Arabella's distant, overly large eyes
and awkwardly open mouth suggest that
Lawrence was wise to stick to his day job.
Pearson acquired "Arabella" for his collec-
tion fronf the model who sat for it, and dis-
played the painting in his office because his
wife declared there to be "too much artisti-
cally wrong" with it to be displayed in the
Pearson home. Much of the art in Pearson's
collection was similarly obtained from
writer-friends, who included e.e. cum-
mings, William Carlos Williams, Tom
Wolfe, and Denise Levertov. Purchased
pieces
by
Robert
Louis
Stevenson,
Thackeray, Proust, and Hugo, among oth-
ers,
round
out
the group.
Pearson's interest in writers' art
stemmed from his desire to gain a fuller
picture (so to speak) of the writers whose
literature he enjoyed. Pearson wrote, "[I]
like to meditate on the relationship
between a writer's painting and his poetry
and prose. Is there a correlation? Does a
writer write better because of learning to
hold a brush?" One might look to e. e.
cummings' paintings for an answer. Along
with Herman Hesse, cummings is one of
the few writers in the collection whose artis-
tic endeavors are particularly extensive and
well known. One of his watercolors, "View
of Silver Lake" is intensely colorful and joy-
ous, yet deliberate. This controlled eupho-
ria is familiar to the reader of such poetry,
as "Picasso I you give us things I which I
bulge: grunting lungs pumped full of sharp
thick mind." Although Cummings' grace-
ful
paintings
do
not
themselves
"bulge:grunting lungs pumped full," these
landscapes demonstrate the ppet's serious
aspiration to be a gentler Picasso.


More obscure is the art of William
Carlos Williams, who studied visual art
before he took up poetry. The calm, bucol-
ic mood of his green-and-brown New Jersey
landscape, "View of Passaic River," shadows
the less calm America of his long poem
"Paterson." The painting hangs in the
office of Nancy Kuhl, the Assistant Curator
of the American Literature collection. "So
few people seem to know that Williams
painted at all-even those who otherwise
know a great deal about his work and his
life," she says. "When they see the painting
in my office, I think people take it in as a
painting, but they begin also to factor the
fact of it into their larger understanding of
the poet/man/doctor/artist who painted
it." Seeing the art of other writers besides
Williams and cummings likewise enhances
familiarity with the people behind the pen.
Like Williams, GUnter Grass also
began his career as a visual artist. His litho-
graph of four huddling, cloaked men whose
heads resemble that of "The Scream,"
haunts the collection. So does Tom Wolfe's
ink sketch of Hugh Hefner as a smoking,
boozing, dictatorial imp. Less threatening
but equally impish is Henry Miller's paint-
ed self-portrait, in which abstract blobs
almost accidentally fuse to compose a
blank-eyed bohemian. George Bernard
Shaw's own watercolor self-portrait, as an
ethereal Don Quixote, reveals the play-
wright's romantic and wry side.


Some of the pieces are more strange
than illuminating. Hilaire Belloc, a French-
turned-British writer of poetry, literary crit-
icism, and military and social history, con-
tributes to the collection an ink sketch of
cartoonish goblins and fairies surrounding
a watercolor inset of a nebulous landscape.
By way of explanation, a pseudo-Latin
inscription captions the picture. Queen
Victoria's miniature figure studies, the
product of her fourteen-year-old hand, also
distinguish the collection. The Queen ren-
ders a pair of horses, a horse-riding Turk,
and a gypsy girl with a goat and tambourine
in simple lines and dutiful cross-hatching.
The "Art for the Wrong Reason" col-
lection was featured in a Beinecke exhibit
about twenty years ago, but since then most
of the art, which is flat and unframed, has
sat quietly in two grey, acid-free boxes. The
occasional scholar does request to see a par-
ticular piece. Yet even if the art does not
regularly appear to the public, there is
virtue in the possibility of future exhibi-
tion, in its in-the-meantime aid to scholars,
and in its very preservation.
Would a Twain sketch by any other
name look as sweet? Perhaps not, but a
Williams painting or Grass litho might.
These works of art, though not master-
pieces, help us to piece together the person-
ality of masters.
