seemed to be ·an excuse for complacency, the same complacency I 
see in a culture that settles for abortion. 


My unfocused thoughts were answered by the sound of our first 
"protester" approaching. "I'm right here," a girl was muttering into 
her cell phone. "Yes, right here." She ended her call,. walked up to 
the table and asked, "What is this?" 
Mary explained and offered her a pamphlet. The girl star~d at 
her in disbelief. She grabbed the pamphlet and declared, as if shout-
ing over a violent commotion, "I really resent this." Then she 
marched off towards WLH, leaving Mary at a loss for words. I 
turned back to the others and wondered if kneeling in prayer with 
them would clear my mind. 


After about two seconds of meditation, we were greeted by 
music so loud I heard it reverberate in the library behind me. Those 
praying around me snapped to attention and glared at the source of 
the offending noise: the top floor of Calhoun. Any idea that the 
disruption was coincidental evaporated when I actually listened to 
the song lyrics: "Here's a butterknife, cut it open, shit it out/That 
motherfucker ain't mine/I ain't payin shit." As devastating protest 
music, it wasn't exactly Dylan; as a disturbance, it was enough for 
Jacqui to phone the police and call in a complaint. I was seeing red 
by this point, but a quick glance around made me feel alone in my 
anger. Everyone else was looking on at the candles with a calmness 
I couldn't understand. Even Mary looked back with a tired smile, 
as if to say: what did you expect? 


I fumed while rap became rock became a repeat of the first song 
again, more butterknife abortion for our edification. What did they 
think we would do-pack up our candles and leave, all because of a 
thousand-decibels of the Red Hot Chili Peppers? Or did they find 
our presence so disgusting that simply causing us humiliation was 
victory enough? I found myself considering the possibility that our 
grave statement on abortion was a joke. It seems to me that too 
many people eschew dialogue every day: the fundamentalists drown-
ing out the world with screams of hellfire; the doctors vacuuming 
heart and brain into the trash; and in my weaker moments, me with 
my pat condemnations of both. I could have laughed, but instead I 
pulled my hood over my head to keep the-cold out. 


Twenty minutes later, a couple of officers showed up, looking 
as annoyed as I was. When the music was finally turned off, every-
one breathed a sigh of relief. I took that as a sign to stop griping to 
myself and finally, somehow, pay my undivided respects. But even 
then it was impossible: I kept drowning out the silence in my head 
with the litany of injustices that fill the pro-life polemic-dehuman-
ization, violation of women, unthinking submission to social 
nonns. I was afraid that if I stopped to listen to myself, I would dis-
cover no grief at all-just empty self-righteousness over a cause 
divorced from my heart and an inability to find meaning in the 
small lights dancing on the grass. 


The discourse in my head was joined by a murmur: the students 
kneeling in front of the candles were beginning a Hail Mary. After 
the _assault of noise to which we had just been subjected, the sound 
of the Rosary was a strange comfort, even for a Protestant-and yes, 
even at that point, I was one of only two Protestants present. 


Realizing this fact made the gears inside start churning again. On 
one hand, something in me stirred at the words, "Blessed is the fruit 
of thy womb, Jesus." On the other hand, I had to wonder why it 
was only natural for our group to mom n with the Rosary. Were

there no others who believed in the humanity of the fetus? 


The religious dynamic of our vigil was altered, however subtly, 
by the arrival of another Protestant. He put his hand on my shoul-
der, as if in sympathy with the sorrow I wished would overwhelm 
me, and bowed his head in prayer. I bowed my head too, fumbling 
for the improvised simplicity of an Evangelical prayer, but, as if on 
cue, the voice of dissent returned. The girl who had informed us of 
her resentment was walking down the steps from the library again, 
with more helpful commentary: "The netve of you people," she 
huffed; then, as she hurried away, "Self righteousr So· ~uch for 
defusing the war zone. 


From that point on, the vigil settled into a stillness that was 
both peaceful and troubling. I closed my eyes and found a rhythm 
of prayer, begging God to visit the unborn, mothers, doctors, 
Canadians, Americans. In an article the next day, the YDN would 
publish a quote that, as much as it pains me, may well be the case: 
"Most students here have made up their minds about abortion, and 
I don't feel a·vigil. is going to change that." 


In spite of its logistical failures, I do not believe our vigil was a 
joke, because at some point I had a revelation that I am still coming 
to grips with. After about an hour of shivering and staring into the 
back of my eyelids, I opened my eyes. The crowd reciting the rosary 
had dispersed, leaving only a handful of the faithful still meditating. 
The cross of candles was burnt out in places but the stubborn lumi-
• 
naria still flickering were enough to keep its pattern recognizable. I 
stared at the candles, the 167 children who will never grow into men 
and women, and suddenly thought: it is so good to be aliye. Written 
down, it sounds almost idiotic, but standing there in the bitter cold 
I repeated it in my head, like my own rosary. I now know what 
pushed distractions out of my mind: the longing to rejoice. I longed 
to celebrate on that freezing night, to pray for a cause no one was 
interested in discussing, as people accused and mocked me. I longed 
not to grieve for the 167 but to celebrate them, the six-week lives, 
the two-month lives, those mute spirits for whom the universe was 
warm and dark and ended all too soon. It may take me a lifetime to 
learn how to celebrate, but that nig~t I came to know how good it 
is to be alive-how good it is to have been born. 


A wind began to blow from behind The candles started to 
flicker; some of the bags were rocking back and forth. I knelt down 
impulsively,~ hands reaching out to steady one of them, though I 
knew it was pointless. Eventually I would have to stand up. The 
wind would still be blowing, and what would the paper bag do but 
begin to rock again? But I stayed squatting anyway, hands poised, 
eyes level with the light.
