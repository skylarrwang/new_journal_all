Twenty years of experience in Manhattan 
paid off for Chung Cho. 
The Whangs deliver exactly what Yale 
recruited them for. With a clean, colorful 
storefront on Broadway, Gourmet Heaven 
brings dining and grocery options to a 
street frequented by students. No alcohol or 
cigarettes are sold, because as Peter said, "It 
just seems inconsistent with the healthy 
concept of food." 
The store fits 
the image Yale's 
Development Office wanted to create for 
Broadway. Hong Kong Grocery, a thirteen-
year veteran of Whitney Avenue was denied 
a Broadway spot because their store was 
"too messy," according to owner Guo 
Zengguang. Their extensive grocery inven-
tory and attached Chinese restaurant were 
not 
enough 
to 
convince 
Yale's 
Development Office that they were a good 
fit for Broadway. Its smell of raw fish and 
exotic vegetables were considered . too far 
from the mainstream. 

AS BUSINESS BEGAN TO PICK UP, the 
Whang family devoted more of its 
time and energy to their New Haven · 
business. "The Manhattan stores became an 
afterthought," said Peter. "If we franchise in 
New England, it would be out of a New 
Haven base," he said. "Yale invested in us, 
and in a way, relocating is our way of 
returning that good will." 
But in some ways, New York City is 
hard to leave behind. The two New Haven 
Gourmet Heavens receive produce shipped 
daily from Huntspoint Market in _the 
Bronx,. the same provider that they've had 
for more than thirty years. When he first 
joined the family business, Peter personally 
made the drive every two days. 
"It's certainly not the easy way to do 
things, but you know, it's a trust thing," he 
said "We know that the produce is of a cer-
tain 
quality, 
and 
the 
customers 
deserve that." 
Peter, who had been working in 
California as a web developer, was called 
back to the East Coast to help out with the 
second Gourmet Heaven, now open on 
Whitney Avenue across the street from 
Hong Kong Grocery. He was out of a job 
after the dot com bubble burst; but for 
Peter, giving up an Internet career to work 
in the deli business meant coming back to 
his root~ He decided that his place was with 
his family.

"It's funny, I got a college degree, l;>ut 
here I am, becomiQg my dad." He pauses, 
nostalgic. "Most people would see that as a 
step down. But I'm proud of it, if I can be 
half the man my dad is. 
I watched him 
struggle to keep up the business. It's hard, 
especially if you don't speak the language." 
So far, ·life in Connecticut is treating 
Peter well, even though the Yankee fan in 
him still bristles when Red Sox victories 
ignite celebration across New England. 
Unlike his brother-in-law, who went to · 
high school in Korea, he is a native English 
speaker, and over the past couple of years 
has become the public face of Gourmet 
Heaven. He has also been working to shift 
the Whitney Avenue store away from the 
Broadway model to fit the demographic of 
the area. Whereas the salad bar and buffet 
options are extremely important for the 
students on Broadway, residential complex-
es near Whitney appreciate the sale of pro-
4uce and specialized organic goods. Law 
offices in the locale provide a steady 
lunchtime sandwich business as well. 
· "It's definitely a change of pace, and 
nothing can duplicate the sheer volume you 
get in Manhattan," he said. "But people 
here are friendly-there is definitely attitude 
in Manhattan-and we're just a big family." 
A growing sense of community for his new 
home is, according to Peter, one of the 
biggest perks of his new career. 
For new storeowners like Peter, Annie, 
and Sera, serving the customer better than 
the competition is essential to success. And 
that means going the extra mile to under-
stand the needs of an unfamiliar communi-
ty. They know that good service brings cus-
tomers back. Sera Nail Salon and Gourmet 
-~ 
Heaven, both young businesses, have had a 
New Haven tenure shorter than a college 
student's four-year stay, but their owners 
have had more intimate contact with the 
city than the average Yalie. 
Annie projects a concerned motherly 
persona toward her young female clientele. 
She stands up briskly to welcome her first 
customer of the hour. 
"How are you?" she asks, helping take 
off the coat of a girl who seemed accus-
tomed to this ritUal. 
"My nails are a mess!" she complained. 
"Long time!""- countered Annie in the 
tone of maternal ~eprimand. 
"Yeah, it's been three weeks," admitted 
the girl. She sat down across from Annie at 
• 
a mamcure statiOn. 
Annie is a pro of 14 years. She makes 
small talk with her client while shaping 
nails deftly. Even though she is dissatisfied 
with her English skills Annie knows how to 
gain the trust of her devoted client base. 
ither by appealing to the University or 
by tapping into the needs of the local 
clientele, these enterprising new store-
owners are part of a new trend of recent 
emigrant businesses opening up in small 
cities and rural areas. With a hardworking 
immigrant ethic and a strong tendency to 
rally around the family unit, they make 
their small businesses in New Haven more 
profitable than Manhattan ventures. They 
are able to capitalize on existing consumer 
populations in· New Haven, finding niches 
left empty by locals. 

When a vacancy arises, should Yale's 
Development office be looking for candi-
dates closer to home? The new faces in New 
Haven-Peter, Annie and Sera-have escaped 
the competition of New York City. But .to 
the Elm City, they have only brought it 
back.
