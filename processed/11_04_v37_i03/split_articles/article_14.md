member to deal with the needs of queer students. As a result, Yale's 
so-called "queer resource center" -which also doubles as the the Co-
op's meeting space-has no regular open hours. Students in need of 
advice, information, or . help are usually forced to turn elsewhere. 
Similarly, there is no counseling service offered to students dealing 
specifically with issues of their sexual or gender identity, and fresh-
men counselors are selected without consideration of their openness 
to LGBT discussion. Finally, Yale allocates no part of its budget to 
addressing the social needs of this segment of its student population. 
When Justin Ross and Arianna Davlos became coordinators of 
the Co-op, the second sem~ster of their freshmen years, they walked 
into a challenge: "When we took over," says Ari, "we were facing 
bankruptcy, and we were constantly worrying about sources of 
funding. We went through a stag~ of real pessimism where we near-
ly gave up. Even now, it's a huge strain-we sometimes joke that we 
should stop attending classes altogether and just run the Co-op." 
Unlike queer student umbrella groups at many other universi-
ties, the Co-op must petition for yearly funding from the 
Undergraduate 
Organization's 
Funding 
Committee, rather than

for necessary change. they hope to utilize the same tactics Stanford 
students employed to mobilize their University, reminding the 
Administration that students only perform well academically when 
they are socially comfortable and happy. 

The push for a queer space is not a push for isolation. "So 
many queer students here are worried about self-segregation," says 
Ari, "but that's not what an LGBT space would be about." Yale's 
cultural houses were · creat~d to facilitate integration and celebration 
of shared background, not to isolate the community; a Queer 
House, advocates insist, would serve that same function .. It would 
also provide a physiCal space to help build a cohesive community. 

The current fragmentation does not allow for a unified voice with 
which to argue for change. 

This fragmentation may be one reason for the relative lack of 
queer activism . which ·one might expect to thrive on a campus as 
politically active and liberal as Yale's. But here queer student 
activists often find themselves defending the purpose of their advo-
cacyt, instead of actually fighting for change. This brickwall may be

a product of tolerance: the lack 
of overt homophobia means 
that students may be more like-
ly to question the need for 
activism. Loren Krywanczyk is 
a queer student organizer and 
also the leader of Trans Action .. 
He notes: "You have to justify 
to people that there really is a 
problem-that 
homophobia 
"has to go through the

goals, and face bankruptcy 
if they are not able to draw 
in large proceeds from dances and other social events. 
There is not just a question of funding, but also a question of 
space. For most concerned student and faculty members at Yale, the 
absence of an official space for queer students, such as a Queer 
House, is a pressing issue. Stanford University boasts a spacious ·and 
recently renovated on-campus Queer Center in a converted fire sta-
tion, with two full-time staff members, paid student coordinators, 
support groups and counseling sessions. It is a facility in which stu-
dents-queer and straight alike-come to study, eat, hang out and 
organize. Co-op heads Justin and Ari visited the Center last year, 
and described it as having a "thriving, fun, and supportive" atmos-
phere, in marked contrast to the back room of 305 Crown Street to 
which the Yale Co-op has been relegated. In addition, each depart-
ment at Stanford designates a faculty member who is openly LGBT 
and is willing to talk to students about LGBT issues. "These little 
things can make a big difference," says Justin, "The more I investi-
gate other schools, the more I realize Yale is lagging behind." 
Justin and Ari believe that Yale should use Stanford as a model

But recently, an uncharac-
teristically public sign of anti-
gay sentiment arrived uninvit-
ed at Yale's doorstep. Beenie 
Man, a rap artist notorious for 
his lyrics inciting people to 
lynch and bum gays, played at 
Toad's in October, despite fer-
vent protest and a signed petition from Yale's queer-friendly com-
munity. "It was a real slap in the face," comments Loren, who orga- · 
nized the protest, "particularly on the anniversary of Matthew 
Shepard's murder, one of the worst recent cases of homophobia." 

And yet, proving that homophobia exists within Yale is not as 
hard as it may seem. The lack of persistent, overt anti-gay sentiment 
obscures the homophobia that does exist, which is private and hard 
to confront. Justin remembers how he was chalking an advertise-
ment for a queer dance on the co~bles of Old Campuslast year, 
wqen a small group of intoxicated Yale students began spitting on 
the sign and shouting homophobic slurs. 

But these instances are perhaps more frequent than at other 
sc\l:ools. Charlie reflects on the environment at Eastman School of 
~sic: "It was so much easier to pull together an active gay com-
I¥nity based on activism, because there were always r~ent acts of 
~emophobia in the collective memory., Charlie recalls putting up 
posters for queer activities, only to have them defamed the next 
mprning by the Christian Fellowship, and fraternity members 
THE NEW jOURNAL 

In response to Toad's refusal to cancel the Beenie Man show, 
"' 
and in honor of Shepard's death, members and allies of the queer 
student community held a candlelight vigil outside of the bar, pass-
ing out fliers and speaking with Toad's customers. In response, they 
were verbally abused and insulted. One girl, Justin and Ari remem-
ber, took a flier, declared that "going in was ok, because her aunt was 
gay," and tnen proceeded inside. More than rampant homophobia, 
complacency-that "some-of-my-best-friends-are-gay" attitude-
defines much of the Yale population's attitudes towards queer issues. 


Because of ·the lack of sufficient support for queer activism, 
Charlie believes that the path towards change is to temporarily put 
aside serious issues, and to focus instead on throwing 
good LGBT parties to rally the community. To this 
end, he and William Cornwell started GaYalies, a 
queer student group that emphasizes the social aS"'"" 
of queer life at · Yale. With their catchy posters-
"Because Britney's a fairy, and so are you" -Ga Yalies 
hopes to use social events as the first step towards 
building a more unified queer community that can then 
agitate for .Fhange. "If I had tried to create a society of 
activism," e:lSplains Charlie, "it wouldn't have worked-
which is why we bill Ga YaJies as a social thing q It's a first 
step to bettering the community." So far, the endeavor seems to be 
a successful one: the GaYalies parties have been well-attended by a 
mixture of undergraduates, graduate s:tudents, professors and non-
Yale students. Charlie hopes the Friday night excitement will soon 
translate into a more serious movement. 
This tactic fits the vision of the Co-op. Says Justin: "When we 
took over the Co-op, we decided to begin with social events to cre-
ate a cohesive community-an active and vibrant queer community 
needs to be demonstrated to the Administration." Ari echoes the 
importance of this approach, "Although (the presence of the queer 
community] seems obvious to students, the Administration just 
isn't aware enough." 

ESPITE ITS LACK OF SUPPORT FOR QUEER STUDENTS, Yale is 
quickly on its way to becoming the pre-eminent academic 
institution for gay, lesbian and queer studies-perhaps 
affirming, in a new way, its identity as the "gay Ivy'". Unlike most 
other universities in the U.S., Yale has been relatively eager to 
embrace queer studies as a serious academic field, something that 
has yet to occur at many other schools across the globe. In doing so, 
Yale has bucked the social-first trend of most universities, taking 
queer academic seriously before seriously supporting queer 
student life. 

Within the recently renamed Women's, Gender, and Sexuality 
Studies (WGSS) department, students are presented with a wfde 
array of course choices dealing with academic approaches to issues 
of sexuality and gender identity as categories of cultural analysis. 
· WGSS majors can choose from one of two tracks: Women's thd 
Gender Studies or Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Sexuality Studies. The 
department is also home to the Larry Kramer Initiative for LesbHln 
and Gay Studies, a five-year long academic endeavor begun in 2062 
, which brings in visiting professors to teach at Yale and host a 
number of academic lectures, symposia, and special events relatiHg 
OcToBER 2004 
to LGBT studies . 

Yale's determination to be at the academic forefront has led it 
to support queer academics over the social needs of its own queer 
community. Jonathan Katz, the Executive Coordinator ofLKI, says, 
"If I were forced into a stark choice, I would say that I am glad Yale 
has chosen to support queer academia first, because it has had an 
impact that has been felt outside ofYale itself." But Katz is also the 
first to admit that social change is 
long overdue: "But I think it's 
time. It's striking to me that a 
university 
that 
supports 
LGBT queer studies can fail to 
understand the palpable 
stress among queer stu-
dents here." 

HAT "PALPABLE stress," unrecognized or at least unaddressed by 
the Yale Administration, has meant that professors like Katz 
end up picking up much of the slack where the institution 
falls short. Queer students often describe Katz as a "super hero" who 
is always willing to go the extra mile when it comes to supporting 
activism. Likewise, many Yale students meet LKI Professor Seth 
Silberman at queer social events before meeting him in the class-
room. While in the classroom Katz insists that LKI is a purely aca-
demic endeavor, rightfully treated as such by Yale, he acknowledges 
that he goes beyond the call of his academic duty; "I am stretched 
thin-the vast majority of my time is spent pursuing academic excel-
lence for LKI, but I would have to be willfully uncaring to ignore 
unmet need." While it is rumored that the Yale Administration 
looks at Katz' involvement in queer student organizing with an 
unsympathetic eye, he serves a need that is otherwise ignored, stu-
dents say-and until someone else is hired to fill this role, he and 
other concerned faculty members will have to fill in. 

Even on the academic front, however, there is room for 
improvement within the program. The Womens, Gender, and 
Sexuality Studies Department l~cks a tenure track for a sexuality 
specialist, meaning that there is, of now, no possibility of a queer 
studies specialist finding a permanent home at Yale. Moreover, while 
LKI ·brings in exciting innovators from the field, it is only a five-
year long program, and LKI professors only have two year-long con-
tracts. For Silbennan, that means that his relationships with his stu-
dents are short-lived: "My students are so fantastic 0 but I'm not 
going to be here to work on most of their senior essays with them," 
he says sadly. The destiny of LKI is unclear. After it completes its 
five-year 
lifespan 
in 
2007, 
it 
might 
be 
over 
for good. 

Consequently, as more queer students come to Yale because of 
its burgeoning academic offerings, more queer students will suffer 
from Yale's lack of social support. "Yale is not only known as the 
gay Ivy, it is also the growing leader in LGBT academia," says 
Justin, who came to Yale partly for the queer studies program. 
"Although it is attracting more LGBT students, it is not address-
ing their social needs to help them perform.'' Justin foresees the rip-
ple effect of Yale's myopia. ~It's such a gaping problem for us, we 
don't understand how others don't see it."
