PROBLEM APPEARS TO BE ROOTED in both financial and 
social causes. Some students and faculty point towards Yale's 
hesitance to invest heavily during its "no growth" period; 
' 
others emphasize the lack of awareness of the Yale Administration 
about LGBT issues. But students and faculty voice one common 
and recurring theme: complacency. Professor Silberman explains the 
problem in these terms: "Despite the obvious shortcomings, things 
are pretty good here. And that 'pretty-goodness' is an excuse not to 
change things." 

While some queer students question the need for a queer house 
or social support, Justin :warns that it is dangerous to assume that 
every queer student will fit easily into the Yale without a more struc-
tured LGBT social program. "We're not just doing this for us. Not 
everyone who comes here is going to be as comfortable~" 

Ari points to the dearth of lesbian students at Yale-she esti-
mates the undergraduate population to be less than fifty-and under-
scores that being a gay woman is not as easy as being a gay man at 
Yale. "There is little to no community of queer women ... gay men 
have been at Yale so long, but lesbians still remain a real minority. 
This translates into even less support [for queer w<:>men]." 

Similarly, students who are trans or coping with trans issues 
find themselves outside of the neat "gay Yalie" conception. With 
even fewer trans students than queer women on Yale's campus, trans 
students make a case for greater ·institutionalized support. Queer 
issues and trans issues are not entirely the same thing-'queer' relat-
ing to one's sexuality, and 'trans' to one's gender identity-still their 
concerns often overlap. Loren has been an active leader of Yale's 
queer community since his freshman year, but has recently started 
to extend his activism to raise awareness· of the needs of trans stu- · 
dents. In doing so, he has realized that while Yale underserves the 
queer community as a whole, its policies are even less supportive of 
trans students. 

How are single-sex suites to accommodate a trans-male student? 
And how are trans students supposed to categorize their "sex" when . 
· · they apply to Yale? How is an institution to take seriously not just 
one's sex, but one's gender identity? Beyond bringing these issues to 
light, of trans students demonstrates that the "gay issue" is not a 
simple one. While some queer students find their home easily at the 
"gay Ivy," others face deep~r challenges. 

Katz echoes this sentiment, pointing in particular to the diffi-
culty some students face with coming out; "People who come out 
[at Yale] do so, overwhelmingly, individually. Coming out is greatly 
eased by a community context-but we have no network for that 
here." Katz adds that this often places a particular burden on ·some 
international members of the community: "My sense is that a per-
centage of all international students choose to study abroad based 
on reasons other than just academics. It's particularly charged as 
Yale becomes more global, and we have students who are glimpsing 
possibilities that are literally foreclosed in their home countries." 

Loren is making slow headway in his attempt to change Yale 
policies to be more trans-aware and friendly. In a series of meetings 
held this year, Loren spoke to Associate Dean of Yale College and 
Dean of Student Affairs Betty Trachtenberg in an attempt to bolster 
administrative awareness about trans issues. The result, he hopes, 
will be some small but significant changes in Yale policy: inclusion 
of "gender identity" in its anti-discrimination policy; changes in 
housing policy to accommodate trans students; and altering the Yale 
application to allow students the option of including written com-
ments about their gender identity, rather than just ticking the 
"male" or "female" boxes. The overall effect of these changes, Loren 
says, will be a resounding message that Yale "institutionally wel-
l " 
comes trans peop e. 

Despite disappointment over Yale's response to queer student 
needs, there are signs that Yale may be creeping forward. One sign 
of progress is the ·recently created LGBT Advisory Committee, a 
body that brings queer student and faculty leaders from Yale College 
and the graduate . schools, together with members of the 
Administration. Begun by Jesse Reed, Program Coordinator of the 
Office of Diversity and Eqt1al Opportunity, the committee seeks to 
centralize the queer resources that currently exist on the Yale cam-
pus, and to gain a broader perspective on the needs of the commu-
nity. PartiCipants hope this initial discussion will catalyze substan-
tial reform. 

The hope that this committee brings is tempered by realism. 
Ventures like this have occurred before at Yale, only to fizzle out 
without making any real progress. And while some prominent 
administrators are beginning to lend a thoughtful ear to queer con-
cerns, including Dean Betty Trachtenberg, they have taken little 
action. 

Despite differing levels of optimism about the Yale 
Administration's readiness, there is a shared sentiment within the 
community about what it will take to effect change. A fragmented 
and complacent community will not suffice; for Yale to become 
institutionally more queer-friendly, concerned students-queer and 
straight-must put pressure on the University. "If the Administration 
is reticent, it's the students' responsibility," Charlie says, "Students 
have to represent their needs and vocalize them." 

· Professor Silberman, who will be leaving at the end of this year 
when his two-year contract with Yale expires, hopes that his students 
will witness changes that he will not be around to see: "What I tell 
my students is that Yale is an institution with 300 years of history-
it is therefore very cautious and has a long-term perspective on 
things, necessarily. Students need to be very articulate, vocal, and 
persistent about what they want." But Silberman reminds his stu-
dents that the onus lies on them to override Yale's complacency 
about queer issues; "LKI itself got here by polemicism-Yale just 
couldn't ignore it anymore. A student outcry can nudge change." 

If the queer community at Yale can push Yale to live up to its 
nickname, then it can be the "gay Ivy" not by default, but by 
principle.
