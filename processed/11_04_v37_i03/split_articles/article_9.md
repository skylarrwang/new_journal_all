Double Agency 
LAST 
MAY-
· , Eritrea celebrated the 13th anniversary of 
its 
independence 
from 
neighboring 
Ethiopia, to which a UN Resolution had 
formally ceded it in December 1950. But a 
major Amnesty International review under-
taken in the months before the country's 
birthday paints what the BBC calls "a 
damning portrait of what Eritrea, once seen 
as one of Mrica' s brightest hopes, has 
become." !he report cites the nine-year 
detention of religious minorities and jour-
nalists, the continued internment of 
Ethiopian POW s, the torture of political 
prisoners and women conscripts, and the 
continued avoidance of a multi-party elec-
-tion despite a 1997 constitutional amend-
ment calling for one. 

Law School Professor Lea Brilmayer 
may be the highest ranked and most over-
looked government official teaching at Yale 
University. Author of two books on the 
conflict between domestic and global 
courts, tenured as the Boltzmann Professor 
of International Law, and an ardent anti-
secessionist, she is also the Chief Legal 
Advisor to the Office of the President of 
Eritrea. 

According to Don Lewis, a partner at 
PiperRudnick LLP in Washington, D.C. 
and one of the counsels for Ethiopia, no 
one is better cut out for the job. "She's a 
true believer in the Eritrean Cause," he says, 
with a certain degree of astonishment that 
anyone actually could be. She could pass a 
lie detector test asserting that Eritrea was an 
innocent little country whose neighbors 
were all out to get it." 

However questionable an affiliation 
with a country that Amnesty International, 
Human Rights Watch, and the UN High 
Commissioner for Human Rights have 
condemned, none of these accusations faze 
either Brilmayer or Yale. In fact, the 
University supports her. The Law School's 
Orville 
H. 
Schell, 
Jr. 
Center 
for 
International Human Rights is the infor-
mational and financial umbrella under 
which all foreign aid programs sponsored 
by the Law School are organized-a Dwight 
Hall for the global community. In its annu-
al guide to human rights programs, there is 
a listing for an 'Eritrea Project.' "Summer 
placements are available for a small number 
of students interested in working in Asmara 
on development and public international 
project 0 rang[ing] from urban planning, to 
seeking compensation for victims of illegal 
deportation from Ethiopia, to preparing 
documents for international arbitration. 
The Law School provides basic travel 
expenses.'' According to Brilmayer, about 
twenty students have taken her up on this 
opportun1ty. 

While Lewis freely admits that Yale 
faculty members are allowed their private 
endeavors, the involvement of students and 
University fundi_ng baffles him. "How," he 
asks, "does a human rights center justify the 
giving of these grants? These students aren't

helping Eritreans, they're helping Eritrea: 
helping its government, its criminal sol-
. diers, and its corrupt president." He cites 
the reports of human rights groups and The 
Hague's decision to condemn Eritrea for 
the "frequent physical abuse of [Ethiopian] 
civilians by means of intentional killings, 
beatings and abductions" as evidence for a 
side of the country ignored by Brilmayer 
and her supporters. 

Brilmayer denies all of these allega-
tions in the same breath as she protests 
implicating the University in her work. The 
Schell Center, in her mind, serves a neces-
sary information conduit that should not 
be confused with support. The same ratio-
nale keeps her from spreading the gospel of 
Eritrea in her classroom or public lectures, 
interesting and relevant as her work might 
be. "I don't proselytize. It's very different if 
a student comes to me in a one-on-one set-
ting and asks about what I do. Then we can 
sit down and talk about it. But I d.on't bring 
it up in the classroom." 

The secrecy with which she blankets 
her work, given its magnitude and the stu-
dent body's interest in international rela- . 
tions and human rights,is almost astound-
ing. Lewis, remarking on Brilmayer's 
unquestioned support by the University · 
and the ignorance of students on the situa-
tion, asks what would have happened if this 
had been not Eritrea but "1980's apartheid 
South Africa. Or Pinochet." While his post 
as opposing counsel has undoubtedly 
biased him against the Eritrean govern-
ment-and Ethiopia has committed its own 
share of human rights abuses and war 
crimes, to be sure-it is curious that 
Brilmayer's work has never elicited either 
interest or controversy in the politicized 
environment of Yale. While apartheid 
South Africa and Pinochet's Chile may be 
too one-sided to serve as good examples, it 
does seem that Eritrea gets ignored largely 
because of its geographical location. Were a 
professor to become centrally involved in a 
contentious western European government, 
however small, it's safe to say that campus 
would take rather severe notice. With a 
recent census count giving it a population 
of some 4,362,000, Eritrea has nearly ten 
times the citizens of Luxembourg and 
about 400,000 more than the Republic of 
Ireland. Why should a professor's taking 
sides in full-scale atmed conflict be less 
polarizing than the endorsement of, ·say, 
6 
the IRA? 

And it's not as if the international 
community has turned a blind eye . 
Following the 2000 
<;f!ase-fire which 
brought an end to what The Hague calls the 
' ·! 
"costly, large-scale interna~ional armed con-
flict'' that raged between Eritrea and 
:~~ . 
Ethiopia, The Hague set up two tribunals to 
settle the sources of co~ict-a Boundary 
Commission to determin'' the new border · 
.. 
of the countries, and a Cl · ims Commission 
to assess awards owed by each country for 
war crimes committed during the conflict. 
In the preface to its decision in support of · 
Ethiopia, the Claims Commissioners 
encouraged both nations to guard against 
the 
"nationalization of the 
truth." 
Btilmayer, who spent the 2000-2001 acade-
mic year on sabbatical in the city of 
Asmara to collect evidence for exactly that 
nationalization, is listed as the chief coun-
sel for the Eritrean government in both 
deliberations. 

Prestigious 
as 
title 
sounds, 
Brilmayer is quick to downplay her role in 
the Eritrean government. Though she 
began handling cases for Eritrea shortly 
after its founding, it is a relationship she 
describes ·as starting almost "irrationally." 
"I'd always been interested. in Africa, I don't 
really know why. I wenJ over and did one 
job for them, and everyone was very warm. 
It was just one of those things," she · 
explains. When confronted with the idea 
that her job description sounds remarkably 
similar to that of the United States 
Attorney General, she only laughs before 
protesting that she doesn't deal with any 
aspects of domestic policy-no Patriot Acts 
come from behind her desk. "I think they 
had . to give me a title of some sort," she 
says, "and this just happened to be it. 
Something to put on my nametag."

Rhyme 
and 
Reason 
ADMIRERS OF MARK TwAIN's 
literature might be unaware 
of the humorist's hidden tal-
ent for doodling on dinner 
napkins while blindfolded. 
Indeed, the underground 
annals of the Beinecke house 
both the manuscript notes 
"Self Portrait, by Henry Miler. 
Adventures. of Tom Sawyer and "Un-Eyed 
Dog," a sketch ."Executed instantaneously 
and blindfolded by I Truly Yours /Mark 
Twain/ (Educated 
artist).'~ ~ The jaunty 
humor ofTwain's caption is reflected in the 
title of the collection to which the sketch 
belongs: the "Art for the Wrong. Reason" 
archive of the Yale Collection of American 
Literature. The archive is named for the rea-
son the works were collected: Its 68 pieces 
were amassed primarily out of interest in 
the writers who created them and less out of 
appreciation for the works' artistic merit. 

The works range from the hastily-com-
posed caricature to the ambitious litho-
graphs or oil painting. The collection was 
originally the private investment of 
Norman HoltJ:leS Pearson (BA 1932, Ph. D. 
1941 ), Ya.le Professor of English and 
American studies and advisor to the Yale 
Collection of American Literature. After 
his death in 1975, all of Pearson's personal 
and scholarly papers were donated to the 
Beinecke, including what he had dubbed 
the 'Art for the Wrong Reason' collection. 

The scholar's own story informs that of the 
art collection he donated to the Beinecke.
