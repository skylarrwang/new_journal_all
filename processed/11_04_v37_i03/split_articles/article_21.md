from the stuffy New England prep school scene, but, as Stover 
realizes, their ideas will inform the future. 
At our own future alma mater, Dink indirectly helps to 
overthrow the system of favoritism that ushers the more tradi-
tional prep school boys .into sophomore societies, junior frater-
nities and the essential senior societies (Skull and Bones, Scroll 
and Key and Wolfs Head). After entering the system seamlessly, 
Dink balks at its mechanism when he instead becomes fascinat-
ed by the bright American dream of his less fortunate class-
mates. Rather than "dropping in" on the elite of his class, he

takes to sitting at the feet of an informal debate society, where 
he encounters Brockhurst, Owen Johnson's own alter ego and 
the intellectual heart of the novel. Brockhurst believes in 
America; he believes in the individual; and he believes that the 
Yale system is completely outdated. "Work for Yale 0 Bah! 
Sublime poppycock!" He rants against Stover's proposition that 
one must put his talents in the school's service. "Of all drivel 
preached to young Americans, this is the worst. I came to Yale 
for an education." Brockhurst rips through his comrades and the 
stultified information that they absorb from Yale courses and 
soon forget. He sees his school and its flaws as a paradigm of 
what's holding the whole country back: "What I criticize here, I 
32 
criticize in American life," he says. He argues for real education-
education about politics, contemporary art and the real world. He 
argues against elitism. Brockhurst's fierce individualism may 
reflect a classic American ideology, but has it really been reflected 
in today' s Yale? The Yale class of 2006 may be more diverse in 
some ways than its 1901 predecessors, but Lawrenceville sent six 
students to Yale in 2002-the same number that passed through 
Phelps Gate over a century ago. 
Yet Stover's Yale barely resembles ours. The residential col-
lege system is still three decades away; co-education, three more. 
While secret societies still recruit juniors to their ranks, now a 
cappella commandeers the rituals of Tap Night (in Stover's day, 
"tap" was a hefty slam on the back, rather than a frantic chorus 
accompanied by a huge cup of mysterious liquid). When Stover 
was on the· football team, he worried for weeks over his punts; if 
our football team only had him and his punts at the Game this 
year, we would eas-
ily best our 
enemy! 
Although 
Johnson's prose 
begs to be read out 
loud in a high 
Bostonian accent, 
he can still pull 
the modern reader, 
even a female one, 
swiftly and enjoy-
ably through 
Dink's boyhood 
and his growth as 
a man. This is a 
story about com-
ing of age. 
Moreover, the 
foundation of 
Dink's experience 
still holds true. At 
Yale, Dink not 
only enjoys the 
warmth of his 
teammates and the 
company of good 
friends, both 
inside and outside 
of his secret society, he also learns that Yale is a difficult place. 
On his very fust day of Yale, his .sophomore mentor, appropriate-
ly named Le Baron, tells him, "In every class there are just a small 
number of fellows who are able to do it and who will do it. All 
the rest don't count." 
Although he rejects Le Baron's point of view, Dink, still 
ambitious, cannot find peace with his less traditionally successful 
companions. Out from under the watchful eyes of his 
Lawrenceville masters, Dink solves his problems by drinking him-
self silly every night at Mory's. On the first train to Yale, he is 
certain he will conquer sophomore year, however he is deeply 
enmeshed in a struggle that he doesn't know how to solve. This

battle of wills between classic society men and the less elite mem-
bers of the class, each trying to create their own path to success, is 
still relevant at Yale today. Cocky freshmen who arrive each year 
on Old Campus find themselves eye-to-eye with men and women 
who equal them in intelligence and drive. Just as Dink was 100 
year -ago, we are thrown among ambitious classmates, and what 
once came easily may now be a struggle. Like Dink Stover, we feel 
like "big men from big schools," but must learn how to live 
among others just as smart and driven as ourselves. Even todays . 
many Yalies still learn more from each other than from professors. 
In the end, elitism prevails for Dink. The very last man 
tapped for Skull and Bones, he is flooded with relief as he is wel-
comed back into the fold, receiving "the mark of approval from 
his own kind." Brockhurst, the visionary, remains outside the sys-
tem, spending his time questioning how Yale should interact with 
the rest of the country. In the 21st century, as Yalies flood the 
White House and vie for political hegemony, this question still 
rings loudly in our ears. Relevant as his questions are, Brockhurst's 
answers are of little help in defining what approach we can take 
today. The role ofYale in America has changed. Yale, a big school 
from a big league, must compete with up-and-coming Midwestern 
NoVEMBER 2004 
and Southern schools for power in the country. 
The meaning ofYale has changed, and no arena demonstrates 
this more clearly than the football field. Whereas Dink's efforts as 
the Yale tight end landed him a spot on the All-American roster, 
Yale football today has become more of a farce than an epic strug-
gle. But while many of us may not understand· the rules of foot-
ball, or what exactly an end does, we understand precisely what it 
is to win, what it is to beat Harvard, and what it is to carry the tri-
umphant shouts of our school up and out of the stadium.
