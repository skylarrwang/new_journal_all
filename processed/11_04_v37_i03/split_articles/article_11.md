WITH MY SEATBELT AND EARMUFFS SECURE,
we go over the final pre-take-off precau-
tions, following yet
pre-made, all-
encompassing checklist. A voice signals
that all is clear, and the plane inches for-
ward. The comfortable feeling of being safe-
ly strapped into the backseat of a car van-
ishes as the single engine propeller plane
jumps from the airstrip and begins to wob-
ble awkwardly. My eyes dart to the pilot,
Ricky Kamp, Forestry School graduate, a
flight student, and his instructor, Charlie
Skelton, the President of Yale Avaiation,
hoping to be assured that everything is run-
ning smoothly. Eventually, the plane stead-
ies, cutting through the autumn air, as my
view of New Haven expands. Scanning the
three glass panes of the aircraft, I feel as
though I am peer-
ing into an undis-
turbed snow globe
of New Haven.
Every
building
appears to me in a
new context, a
part of a clearer
picture of New
Haven. My exag-
gerated view of
Yale as the epicen-
ter of New Haven
shifts into scale.
Yale Aviation
was launched in
1915 by then Yale
sophomore
Trubee Davison.


The club's alumni include the founders of
Pan American Airlines and of Federal
Express. The group became the first aerial
coastal patrol unit and originally served as
a springboard into the Army. Today's club
is purely recreational. It is no longer direct-
ly affiliated with Yale because of liability
reasons, and twenty percent of its members
have no Yale affiliation. Interest in sustain-
ing the club has not dwindled over the
years, and it still serves-indirectly at least-as
occupational training. Kamp believes that
air training is the ultimate multi-tasking
challenge.
"Ikea's parking lot is nearly full again,"
Skelton laments. The massive aerial eyesore
is matched by a parking lot, nearly as large
and equally bland. Gliding past Ikea,
Skelton offers a passing remark about Yale-
New Haven's presence. "You get a feel of
the size of Yale's hospital-and it's expand-
ing." He points out Ingalls rink. I turn to
glance down at it as we fly by. Its smooth
lines make it look like a grey turtle shell
sleeping amongst the beautiful collage of
treetops.


Yale Aviation provides an enticing
promise: "The possibilities that await you
as you soar skyward are endless." The orga-
nization extends its invitation on signs at
Yale Station post office, The club boasts up
Skelton, a dedicated, top-notch head
instructor in a four-plane fleet, and a flock
of 82 members, who take in the view of
New Haven-among other sights-from
2,000 feet up.
Skelton's red-tinted aviator glasses and
his captain's voice-soothing, steady, and
clear-make the
novice flyer feel
safe under his
wings. His rela-
tionship
with
planes
started
when he joined
the Air Scouts, a
group under the
international
Scouting move-
ment
that
emphasizes fly-
ing
activities.
He obtained a
job through the
Air Scouts ser-
vicing airplanes
at
Tweed-New
Haven airport, where he worked until
enrolling in Quinnipiac University. He
then joined Yale's Navy ROTC and later
served as a Marine colonel and fighter pilot.
His aviation and military background are
revealed in his regimented yet calm
demeanor.


Before we take off, Skelton's equally
meticulous student, scans his checklist a
second time while peering into crevices in
search of "crack manifolds" that could dan-
gerously spread. "It's no place to pull over
up there," he says as he stares under the
plane for any malfunctions. Skelton
explained to Kamp that most repairs to the
planes, whose manufacturing dates range
from 1966 to 1975, are "frighteningly
expensive." Still, the club services its fleet
more often than is required by law. Skelton
has yet to witness an accident, and the
planes' ages are masked by new paint jobs
and polished parts. Kamp regularly reads
the National Transportation Safety reports.


Many fatal accident reports cite "relative
inexperience," he says. Kamp can but has
not flown solo because he refuses to take
the written test, which necessitates 40
hours of previous flight. He believes gain-
ing experience is important and is in no
hurry to rush through the pilot classifica-
tions.
In the air, a message blurs over the
radio signaling that another plane is near-
by. Suddenly, my two companions begin
making brisk movements in all directions
trying to spot the other craft. This time I
am unwarrantedly calm. When they spot
the other aircraft, they settle comfortably
in their seats again. Despite the over 100
hours of flying time Kamp has clocked,
Skelton maintains a "sterile cockpit"-con-
versation is mainly limited to take-off,
landing and flying. "If you're going for
instruction, paying for instruction, you are
going to be instructed," Kamp said.


It is no surprise that the club is expen-
sive, which is one reason the faculty advi-
sor for the club, Lawrence Manley posits
for limited undergraduate enrollment. The
club requires an initial $150 fee-undergrad-
uates receive a $25 discount-and monthly
dues of $37.50. In addition, flyers pay an
in-flight hourly fee that hovers around $80
per hour. The price is well worth it for
those who can afford membership, howev-
er. "For me, it's exhilarating. It keeps me
out of the office," Kamp said.
For Kamp, his flying hobby and his
career mingle in the cockpit. According to
Skelton, Kamp "takes more photos than
anyone I have known." The aerial photos
allow him to assess environmental viola-
tions, part of his job with the Department
of Environmental Protection. The view
from above gives him a better idea of envi-
ronmental damage. His first comments are
not about the buildings, as Skelton's are,
but about the impending haze where the
New York city skyline should be. He
remarks that after it rains, everything
appears clean and fresh from above, but the
pollution quickly builds up again.
As we circle New Haven one last time,
my head aches slightly and my stomach is
tested by two minor patches of turbulence
(perhaps caused by the wind deflecting off
