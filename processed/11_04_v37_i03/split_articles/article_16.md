**Title:  Korean Dreams in New Haven**

VERY DAY SERA KIM AND ANNIE PARK 
spend three hours commuting from 
Queens, New York to open up shop on 
the corner of College and Crown St., where 
none of their customers speak Korean. 

Annie had worked for over 14 years as a 
manicurist in Queens, but bought into the 
New Haven deal when Sera decided to buy 
a nail salon about three years . ago. 

"Good location, but not busy now," 
. 
Annie says, waving her arm at the empty 
manicure stations. "Oh my god, it's dead in 
here!" For a Thursday, business is frustrat-
ingly slow. Annie and Sera are waiting at 
the register, wondering if they will break 
even today. 

Annie, straight faced, with her hair in 
a tight bun, looks her part-a keen business 
woman who has spent decades just making 
ends meet. In Korean, Annie is an expert 
conversationalist, but when she switches to 
English, her choppy pidgin is as economi-
cal as her appearance. "She really likes it 
here," says Annie, pointing at Sera after a 
long conference in Korean with her friend, 
"but meD" --she makes a gesture as if to say, 
she could be better. "Very big problem for 
the language. "I want to perfect speak. But I 
can't, 
so 
I 
sayD;" 
She 
makes 
the 
• 
gesture agam. 

Sera and her husband came to the 
United States because they believed their 
sons would be better served with an 
American college degree. Annie, too, came 
fourteen years ago to give her daughter an 
American education. The two met at the 
Korean church in Queens where Sera's hus-
band now serves as pastor. The church has 
served as both an internal and external net-
work. It helped them adapt to the neigh-
borhood and then raise the resources to 
branch out of it in favor of this new one. 

Sera, a relative newcomer to the coun-
try compared to Annie, is a former full-
time housewife. Now, like many other 
immigrants, she is building her own 
American dream: she has opened a store in 
a new town where the business is said to be 
good, in order to put her two sons through 
college. 

Sera struggles to explain with the little 
English that she knows. "I spend a lot of 
money for my sons' education in this coun-
try," she says. Her older son is at Buffalo 
University, and her younger son is prepar-
ing for the SATs. She doesn't see him 
very much. 

But Sera doesn't seem unhappy. If she 
feels resigned to the fact that she is dedicat-
ing her middle age to daily three-hour com-
mutes, she doesn't show it. Above all, she's 
a "mommy," she says, and if her sons are 
happy, she is happy. 

Crossing the Long Island Sound is not 
a new immigration pattern. New Haven 
prides itself on a long history of ethnic 
diversity, but because the city is dominated . 
by black and white issues, with an occa-
sional mention of the Hispanic population, 
most discussions focus on race relations of 
these groups. Only 3.9 percent of the popu-
lation is identified as Asian. Most· new· 
immigrants, even those who have heard of 
New Haven, deem New York City a more 
logical place to settle. The area of Queens 
where Annie once worked was filled with · 
people who spoke her language. But recent-
ly, New Haven has lured a few entrepre-
. neurs away from those communities. 

Why did Annie and Sera leave the 
comfort of their original Korean enclave in 
New York and risk the few resources they 
had to start their own business? Why did 
they walk out of their comfort zone, the 
surrogate home of Korean Queens, and 
into the unknown? 

In an immigrant neighborhood, com-
petition is fierce. Despite the fact that New 
York's Asian immigrant community is 
strong and cohesive, everyone is trying to 
make money using a similar skill set. 
Restaurants, delis, laundromats and mani-
cure salons are on every block, fighting for 
the same clientele. In New Haven, on a 
quiet day like today, the move seems like a 
mistake, but the truth is, Annie and Sera 
don't have nearly as many competitors on 
the corner of College and Crown as they 
would on a corner in Queens. 

The two friends get a strong returning 
Yale clientele and a decent amount of busi-
ness from locals. They earn enough profit 
to make it worth the demanding schedule, 
· the risk, the loneliness, and the commute. 
They have the satisfaction of putting their 
children through college. , For these women, 
there has never been another option. They 
live for their families. 

For storeowners wi~ longer history in 
New Haven, however, family has become 
synonymous with business. Annie and Sera 
still have one foot in ~ew York and one 
foot in New Haven. But other immigrant 
families have transplantep their en~re lives 
here. Although Peter Whang, one of the 
owners of Gourmet Heaven, grew up watch-
·ing his parents run delis in Manhattan, he 
now lives in Connecticut. The store he left 
in New York was a family business, which 
his parents started before he was born, more 
than thirty years ago. Many of his parents' 
friends also ran delis, tapping into a busi-
ness pattern that worked within the ~orean 
immigrant community, which burgeoned 
during the 60s, 70s, and 80s. But in the past 
five years, delis have been closing left and 
right. 

"It just doesn't make sense anymore," 
said Peter, who was born and bred in 
Manhattan. "My feeling is that the 
Manhattan area is tapped out. Delis are a 
dime a dozen there. The rents are astro-
nomical; and the economic downturn has 
something to do with it, too." One store-
front that his family had leased for several 
years, he recalled, started asking $75,000 a 
month. The September 11 terrorist attacks 
were a particularly personal trauma for the 
Whangs, who owned a deli inside the World 
Trade Center. Pressured by the increased 
number of delis in the area and the eco-
nomic downturn, the Whangs looked 
to move. 

When Bruce Alexander, Yale's Director 
of New Haven and State Affairs, aggressive-
ly recruited the Whangs to open a deli in 
New Haven, they were ready for change. 
Peter's brother-in-law Chung Cho opened 
the first New Haven Gourmet Heaven on 
Broadway in March of 2001. 

Representatives 
from 
. Bruce 
Alexander's office specifically chose the 
Whang deli out of all the delis in 
Manhattan. During a formal trip to 
Manhattan, Alexander and his representa-
tives entered and asked to speak with the 
owner. Eventually, they persuaded the 
Whangs to make a move out of a city they 
have called home for decades. 

And if sales are any measurement, a 24-
hour Manhattan-style deli is just what New 
Haven needed. The Yale student response to 
the first store was immediate. Although 
prices are high for the average student bud-
get, Gourmet Heaven is one of the only 24-
hour food sources available. Savvy to the 
health-consciousness of a college campus, 
the Whangs take special care to serve organ-
ic and high quality food. They fill their 
drink refrigerator with designer juice bottles 
instead of clunky family-sized cartons.
