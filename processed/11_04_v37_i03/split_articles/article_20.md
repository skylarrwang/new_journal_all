I heart. The kids pass it around, and Clara tests us by asking if we can name all four chambers. Everything is a mash of slippery, greasy mush and looks nothing like the drawings of the human body I yawned at in high school science classrooms. "It's almost, in some ways," Clara says, thinking out loud, "as if we are more different on the inside than on the outside." 


A curious Career student asks why the face is still covered up. "That's just not to freak you out," Clara says candidly. "It's easier to go into surgery mode with the sheet over their face. It's sort of upsetting to think, 'Whoa, this is a person with a life and a family."' 


I take a deep breath and step back from the table. Jonathan looks at me with concern. "Whoa," I am thinking: "This could be me." 


"surgery mode" is not the point of first year anatomy. On the contrary, other medical schools have described Yale's anatomy courses as too "touchy-feely." 


"Most other medical schools," Dr. Rizzolo defends, "would say 'toughen up, suck in your gut."' Yale, instead, encourages students to feel. "We can't afford to deny our emotions: the rate of drug abuse and suicide in this profession is very high." To get the job done and to be a good surgeon, doctors need to deal with their fears to a certain extent. "What's the alternative? To become some kind of machine? 0 We don't want to suppress the qualities that make you a good caregiver. To do this you have to come to terms with your own feelings about death and dying." In Anatomy Classroom N331, the living are studying the dead and the dead are teaching the living. With the living hovering over, the dead lay on tables, their cloudy eyes staring toward the sky. 


And it's not until I'm halfway home-my lab coat shoved in the laundry bin, the latex residue from my bloody gloves violently scrubbed from my hands, that I realize I have never been so afraid of death. 


Each February, anatomy students gather in the Yale Medical Historical Library, a wooden room in a nearby building on Cedar Street, for the yearly "Service of Gratitude." Programs are passed about with a short list of speakers printed on the interior flap, but everyone here already knows what it says: the only invitees to this ceremony are the graduates of this anatomy class, who gather to present poems, songs, speeches, and artworks to the memory of their "donors." In 2002, the service included a poem by a student named Jena titled "Appalled;" in 2003, a story titled "Be not afraid." Every year, students use the forum to express mixed feelings about the practice. Last year, in the spring of 2004, one student denounced the practice of dissecting cadavers at all. 


"One student got up and said this was sacrilegious, that he just didn't buy it," said Rizzolo. "I remember the dissenting student very well," Stewart recalled. "He was unable to ever feel comfortable with it. Although he did it, and passed the course," he pauses, "he felt as if it was a violation." 


Instead of shunning the "dissenter," the two co-professors invited him to speak at next year's first class. "We think that there are probably elements of his feeling in just about all of the students," Stewart explained. "Every year there is one." 


This year, it's probably Roald, who as a Yale undergrad, with a degree in art, and is cast by his classmates as the sensitive student who always finds a way to disagree with his entire discussion group. "Every time I walk around I see people but I also sort of notice that they're walking bags of organs and water," Roald says. "I just think it's a sad fact that we have to adopt this world view." Everyone in my section is always saying, 'I've never been the same ever since I found that organ with my bare hands.' Well, I don't want to feel that change. I don't trust their enthusiasm. I think it's just a fine line that separates scientific considerations and morbid curiosity." 


Some schools have found that teaching from cadavers is outdated and are beginning to work with technology that images a 360 degree view of the interior of a human stitched together from thousands of MRI scans. Classes taught this way have tested just as well as classes taught from bodies, and even Dr. Stewart admits that "in 100 years, technology will probably replace the donor," though there are strong arguments against this literal de-humanization. 


Rizzolo and Stewart are careful when they speak to me about "donors." To them, questioning the donors' decision at all is disrespectful. Medical students are expected to be grateful. In this light Roald's stance is near heresy: "Maybe it's not respectful toward my donor to feel this way about dissecting her, but none of the stuff I'm doing to her is either," he says. "I personally feel really certain that this whole practice will be seen as outmoded and barbaric, just as grave-robbing does to us now." Though it may be systematized, he argues, the details are still hazy to most. 


Knowing the exact details of what will happen to your body is known as "informed consent." Stewart agrees that while donors know they will be dissected, "if you asked them what those procedures were and how they would appear when they were dissected, they would not be able to answer." And perhaps with good reason: dissection is grizzly, some argue if donors were fully informed they would rescind their generosity. Even Dr. Rizzolo, who speaks of the body as "an incredible machine, more fantastic than you can imagine," has been, to put it bluntly, grossed out. "The second time I did this, up until the dissection of the pelvis, everything seemed as though you could put it back together, and at the day's end, things were whole," Rizzolo says. "But with this procedure it seemed like so many mangled bodies-legs stuck out at angles you could not have stretched in life." 


These professors are maximally informed. And neither has chosen to donate his body for dissection. "If you go around a hospital and ask, you'll find that very few doctors would be willing to donate their bodies, and these are the people who benefited directly from it," Rizzolo says. Phil Lapre, the anatomy mortician, would also choose not to donate, and instead opt, like Belanger, for a quick cremation. When I ask Lawrence Rizzolo why the majority of doctors are unwilling to gut themselves for their own cause, he pauses: "My very non-scientific, informal response is that maybe they know too much of what goes on inside." 


If I was going to go ahead and donate, I thought I needed to be informed, to know "too much." But I may have been going about this all the wrong way.


Though physically, my donated body will follow the path I've been tracing, I won't actually be anywhere at all. So I turn towards the philosophical. Samuel Gorovitz-a Yale philosophy professor, ethicist, and author of Doctors' Dilemmas: Moral Conflict and Medical Care, who spends most of his time pondering the afterlife, argues that the question of donation is moot. 


"We must ask the question, 'should we care at all about what happens to our bodies after we're dead? Logically, the answer is 'no, of course not.' Because when we're dead, we don't exist anymore, and it shouldn't make any difference to us now." But Gorovitz understands that, strangely, logic is not at issue here: "The reality is that most of us do care." Gorovitz himself wouldn't donate anything. "I would choose cremation because I take pretty seriously the land use aspects around today's sprawling cemeteries." 


What values do I hold? And do they have anything to do with overcrowded cemeteries or a handful of students I will have never met? Shirley Neighbors, the teacher who created and currently teaches the publicized Career High School course, has calculated the benefits her students have received in multiple ways. At a Boston conference of the American Medical Association, Ms. Neighbors and Dr. Stewart presented statistics that they believe prove that high school students can learn anatomy. "Not only did they pass difficult exams," Ms. Neighbors says with pride, "Their grades in other classes went up when they took this class." This year, Dr. Stewart hopes the high schoolers' exposure to these bodies will prompt them to take their own health into stronger consideration: eat more vegetables, exercise regularly, and respect and appreciate their own bodies. He believes that their direct confrontation with death impacts their lives in a fundamental way, and understands that when we learn from the dead, we appreciate most what it means to be living. 


The majority of the bodies in the anatomy lab lived outside the ivied walls and now serve as "research tools" for the University. When Harvard University accepted a cadaver a few years ago, it came with a note (they often do). "I couldn't make it to Harvard as a youngster, but I'm coming now." The note is initially shocking, but it's worse when you learn that such letters are "typical." Whoever wrote that note did end up at Harvard, but only as chunks of skin in red pails lining a room. He ended up incinerated and disposed of. He went through corridors, freezers, embalmment rooms, classrooms. He ended up the way we all eventually do. 


Since seeing the bodies, I am constantly queasy. I have stopped eating meat. When I look at people's hands I hallucinate that I can see their tendons moving like streams. I pray. I have nightmares and cry when characters on TV shows die. Before I go on a road trip one weekend, I write a provisional will on the desktop of my computer. Everyone, even when wrapped in their wintry parkas and chattering busily in steamy cafes, seems to me packed and cold, "bags of organs and water." I suddenly want to control it all, to stop it, to pull the plug. I want to rip up my donor card. I want to be cremated, to go untouched. But I realize it doesn't matter. I will not really go to the morgue or to the snaking tunnels buried in Yale's basements. I will see nothing. I will hear nothing. And so I might as well give everything away.


Two weeks later, it's as if nothing ever changed. I suppose I've repressed it all, forgotten the bone saws and eyeballs, the bodies lined up in rows. There will be snappy stories that will bubble up in cocktail party conversations, or days when I shudder at the memory of some daydreamed image, but this is a piece of my life which refuses to fit with the rest. To leave the world of death is to leave a country to which you can never return. Perhaps it is hidden because we should not go there.
