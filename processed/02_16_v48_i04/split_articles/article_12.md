not get the letters, and many who did get the letters did 
not understand that they could be deported if they did 
not attend their hearings.

By October, legal assistants began to understand the 
scope of the problem. One of the main organizations 
working at the detention centers, CARA, a coalition of 
immigrant advocacy groups, maintains a database of 
information about asylum seekers. This database cov-
ers only the asylum seekers who have interacted with 
CARA (as of publication, approximately six thousand), 
just a fraction of the total flow, Reddy says. 

With the information from CARA, ASAP can call 
into a government hotline, obtain information about 
upcoming hearings, and notify women about their 
court dates. The voice on the other end of the line has 
the flatness of an official recording: “Welcome to the 
automated case information hotline,” a woman’s voice 
says with little inflection. The recording is a little too 
loud, and a little too repetitive: “The alien registration 
number, also known as the A-number, begins with the 
letter A and is followed by an eight- or nine-digit num-
ber.” It is neither hostile nor friendly, but the flatness 
is unsettling. “Please enter those numbers now.” The 
Yale volunteers have heard these recordings dozens of 
times—the same message appears every time they call. 

About two hundred Yale Law students and under-
graduates filed into room 127 in the Sterling Law Build-
ing in late October. Armed with laptops and phones, 
they turned the lecture hall into a call center. They 
dialed for hours. The room was mostly quiet as they 
typed numbers identifying asylum seekers into their 
phones; occasionally, someone would get information 
about an upcoming hearing and yell. (Alina Aksiyote, 
a volunteer, told me that the number entered often has 
no record to match, either because the asylum seeker 
has been deported or a hearing has not yet been sched-
uled.) Pizza appeared, and the volunteers ate. Then 
they kept dialing. This went on from six to nine at night 
and happened again the next day, and the day after.

ASAP got through the backlog of approximately 
four thousand released asylum seekers during the ini-
tial flurry in October. Twenty or so volunteers drawn 
from the seven other schools affiliated with ASAP, 
including the law schools at Columbia, Georgetown, 
and DePaul, now aim to assist a few hundred people 
per week. They work from a spreadsheet, filling logis-
tical details into a script they send out through texts. 
“Hello,” it begins, in Spanish. “I am a volunteer with 
the group that helped (name) when she was detained. 
This is a reminder that (name) has an immigration 
court hearing on (date) at (time) in (city, state).” The 
asylum seekers often do not have cell phones; these 
messages go to their family, friends, or hosts, who are 
listed in the database. It continues: “It is very import-
ant that she attend this hearing, as not attending might 
result in her deportation.” 

One of the volunteers, Charlotte Finegold ’17, 
described it as sending texts “out into the ether.” Some-
times, those who text back ask if ASAP can help friends 
with legal problems. Many reply with something far 
briefer: “Muchas gracias.” 

ASAP seeks to guide asylum seekers around the 
flaws of a system which the government could fix but 
hasn’t. This lack of official aid, for Reddy, is the most 
emotionally exhausting part of the work. The detention 
centers, the broken notification system for hearings, 
the hair-trigger threshold for deportation—ultimately, 
the government is treating these people not as asylum 
seekers, but as criminals, according to Reddy. Her con-
solation is the attorneys at the detention centers; the 
volunteers updating the database in New Haven; the 
churches in Texas where asylum seekers and their chil-
dren receive backpacks full of clothes and food. 

What else is there to do when you’re wrestling with 
World War II-era refugee conventions, state-subsuming 
criminal gangs a continent away, and an impersonal 
federal bureaucracy? Prepare twenty-five document 
collections a week. Send two hundred texts. Scale up, 
expand. Expect that the system can change, and try to 
temporarily cover its cracks.

There was a fatal flaw 
in the government’s 
plan: hundreds of 
families did not get the 
letters, and many who 
did get the letters did 
not understand that 
they could be deported 
if they did not attend 
their hearings.
