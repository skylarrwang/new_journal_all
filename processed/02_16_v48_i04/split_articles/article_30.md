Dear readers,

This brief letter serves as both an introduction and a 
sign-off: we will not be at the helm of the publication 
for the upcoming issue. For the past year, we’ve been 
working behind the scenes to bring you The New Journal 
by helping our writers share their reporting with you. 
Just as the school year is unpredictable, so too is the ebb 
and flow of the news cycle. We hope you’ve learned as 
much as we have while following our reporters along 
on their trips, from basement parties in New Haven to 
doomsday-preppers’ homes in suburban Connecticut, 
from cornfields in Mexico to protests at the heart of Yale. 
Thank you for supporting us in all our endeavors. We 
look forward to joining you, our readers, when we open 
the next issue of the magazine in April.
