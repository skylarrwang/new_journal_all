Initiative to come inspect her apartment. She tried 
filing her own case against Northland. (She was training 
to be a paralegal at the time, she told me, which helped 
her with the process.) But when Del Hoyo made a 
minor mistake on a form, Northland’s lawyers were 
able to get the case dismissed. She went to Marx at New 
Haven Legal Assistance, and the two of them started 
gathering other accounts of mistreatment. Del Hoyo 
texted neighbors she knew in the complex, asking if 
their apartment had black spots on the ceilings; Marx 
walked around Church Street South, asking people if 
she could see if the walls in their homes were leaking. 
Her office is now working with ninety-nine families, and 
the list is growing. 

While we are talking, DeJesus’s youngest daughter, 
Ashley, who’s 13 and speaks in a soft, measured voice, 
and 
Naydeliz, 
DeJesus’s 
2-year-old, 
bright-eyed 
granddaughter, run into the room. They ask: “Can we 
go to the lobby?” and then, later, “Can we go to the 
pool?” Those are their only options for play, unless they 
want to run down the hall with their Yorkshire or hold 
their green parrot Pistachio, who squawks from beneath 
the pink rag covering its cage. 

DeJesus’s aunt, Haydee Diaz, who lives on the third 
floor of the Clarion, joins us on the couch. Diaz lives 
by herself. She also has breathing problems, and she 
says her doctor insists on monthly visits after seeing 
photos of the mold under her sink at Church Street 
South. With Diaz in the room to add to the complaints, 
DeJesus gets angrier about how long she’s waited for a 
home. They repeat the phrase, “What’s going to happen 
after a year?” after most of their sentences, as if it were  
a prayer. 

“We’re not asking to come out of the Jungle and 
live in a palace!” DeJesus says. “We want something 
comfortable,” The city’s housing authority is helping 
locate new homes, but finding a comfortable spot 
requires time and energy, the kind DeJesus simply 
doesn’t have. With her severe illnesses, children, and 
lack of a job, she is more disadvantaged in the housing 
race than most tenants. 

When the kids are off at the pool, DeJesus and Diaz 
have a harder time keeping their emotions in check. 
When Diaz starts to cry, steeling her face by looking 
at the TV, DeJesus burrows her face in her aunt’s 
shoulder. Then, she looks at me. 
“You know, we’re sitting here and talking to you,” she 
says slowly. “But inside we’re dying to cry.” 

She adds one more thing. 
“All I can say is, God bless Amy. God bless David 
Rosen.” Diaz nods in approval. 

City Hall, New Haven, Connecticut
In November, Marx and Del Hoyo came to Meeting 
Room 3 of New Haven’s City Hall to present their 
case to the Black and Hispanic Caucus of the Board 
of Alders. (The majority of tenants at Church Street 
South, like the residents of New Haven generally, are 
Black or Latino.) Del Hoyo came straight from work, 
her burgundy-tinted hair pulled back into a tight bun.
“Thank you, chairwoman, for your tireless efforts 
so far,” Marx said, addressing Ward 6 alder Dolores 
Colón, the chairwoman of the caucus. After hearing 
Marx’s concerns and Del Hoyo’s testimony, the alders 
voted unanimously to put pressure on Northland from 
inside the city government. Perhaps they could deny 
the company building permits or cite the Fair Housing 
Act rules to describe how Northland’s harmful practices 
disproportionately affect minority residents. There 
would continue to be meetings about Church Street 
South and the larger housing landscape of New Haven 
in the coming months, in the same room and with 
many of the same faces. But, for Del Hoyo and DeJesus, 
little has been decided. The rest of the complex’s 
families have to stay put in the meantime.  

Small numbers of residents continue to move out of 
Church Street South each month, but the number of 
available spaces for them in New Haven is shrinking. 
No law requires Northland to replace the complex’s 
301 units. Marx is wary that the company could find a 
way to duck out, perhaps by dumping all the tenants 
into temporary housing or building apartments that the 
current residents couldn’t afford.

Gottesdiener, Northland’s CEO, told the Boston 
Globe that the Church Street South negligence “is an 
organizational failure and I take responsibility for it. 
We’re not seasoned subsidized housing developers.” But 
he also wrote about Marx in an October email to the 
New Haven Independent:

While we commend her for shining a spotlight on 
this issue, it is time for her to stop pointing fingers and 
start working toward the ultimate goal, getting all of the 
families into quality housing with as little disruption to 
their lives as possible…

In December, Northland proposed a new plan 
designed to relocate the Church Street South tenants 
within the next six months. If HUD approves it, the 
tenants will have two options for new housing: they 
can take part in something called an “8bb transfer,” in 
which residents will move to another large complex that 
Northland has to find and coordinate. They can also 
request a “portable voucher,” a type of subsidy that will 
follow them to an apartment or house of their choice. 
Both pose problems: the 8bb is preferable for people

who might have trouble getting voucher approval, 
since certain landlords deny leases on the basis of 
language barriers, illnesses, disabilities, and criminal 
records. But the list of possible locations that Northland 
has proposed to HUD for this transfer, Marx says, is 
anything but helpful—even a “fiction.” One location, 
called Val Macri, is a fully subsidized, fully occupied 
complex for homeless people. Many of the other 
buildings aren’t even in New Haven. The voucher 
allows people to select their own homes, for which the 
tenants will pay only thirty percent of the cost. But in 
New Haven, there simply aren’t enough units in the 
city—the pickings for three-, four-, and five-bedroom 
apartments are slim and often too expensive. 

Karen DuBois-Walton, executive director of the 
Housing Authority, explained that it’s impossible for 
Northland to move the Church Street South tenants 
at once: “They’re not going to find 301 units all in one 
effort, so my guess is they’ll find the first twenty, and 
then another thirty.” 

Northland, HUD, and the city are currently 
negotiating who is going to pay, and how much, to make 
this all come to pass. After the company agreed to pay 
for portable vouchers, the process gained momentum. 
Civil rights attorney David Rosen is preparing a 
lawsuit separate from Marx’s. He wants Northland to 
pay its former occupants for damages. In his office on 
Orange Street, with his feet propped on his desk, he 
tells me he’s looking for serious compensation.  

The New Haven Register called Rosen the “dean 
of the civil rights lawyers in Connecticut.”  In 1970, 
he represented Bobby Seale, the co-founder of the 
Black Panther Party. Seale was tried and acquitted for 
shooting Alex Rackley, a fellow Panther thought to be 
a spy, in the back of the head and dumping him in the 
Coginchaug River in Middleton, Connecticut. Since 
what Rosen calls “the trial of the century of the year,” 
he’s continued to focus on civil rights cases.

“They’re stuck,” Rosen says of the Church Street 
South tenants. “For the most part, they’re parents of 
young children, and the ones who are working aren’t 
making much money at all.” He’s working with Del 
Hoyo, DeJesus, and many others, but his process thus 
far is quieter than Marx’s—his case is simmering as he 
collects information on everything from lost furniture to 
damaged lungs.  

If Rosen’s lawsuit ends up calling national attention 
to Church Street South, it could also emphasize serious 
questions about how HUD conducts business with 
low-income properties. While the 20/100 score HUD 
recently gave the complex reflects tenant complaints, its 
81/100 score in October 2014 is confusing. There were 
no major capital investments in Northland between 
2013 and 2015, meaning that there is no obvious reason 
their evaluation rose about 20 points from 64/100 in 
October 2013 before plummeting so drastically.   

Amidst all the wrangling over who is to blame, 
one thing is clear: nobody wants to pay. Rosen’s 
case is against Northland, but the government was 
still responsible for funneling money to a negligent 
landlord. Rhonda Siciliano, the spokeswoman of the 
HUD regional office in Boston, which oversees New 
Haven, says the department sampled only a few units 
at Church Street South during the earlier inspections, 
contributing to the misleading results. Their inspection 
process, she said, doesn’t even allow mold to affect 
scores in meaningful ways. If HUD can miss serious, 
complex-wide issues, how can the department ensure 
that they catch life-threatening conditions? 

Tyler Street, New Haven, Connecticut
At this visit, there’s no lobby to go through—or 
around—before knocking on the door. Yomaly Rivera’s 
new house is on Tyler Street, and I’m waiting on her 
front steps. The house has two floors, a driveway, its own 
mailbox, a backyard, and even a Christmas tree inside, 
under which Rivera has placed a tower of presents for 
her kids. She’s still in the process of decorating, but 
she’s proud to show me around. (Her daughter Tatiana’s 
room, for instance, lacks a bedframe, but it has cheetah-
print curtains for now.) “I love it here,” she says, again 
and again. She’s right across the street from Evergreen 
Cemetery. When she lets me in the front door, she 
glances at the rolling hills of tombstones from her 
porch. “The neighbors are quiet.” 

“I was so excited,” she said, remembering the

moment she found the house. She could finally move 
out of her room at the Premiere Hotel, where she had 
lived since August. “I was jumping around.” That day, 
the landlord called her to say the house passed HUD 
inspection, and all that was left was to get an official 
record of that pass, sign some papers at Church Street 
South, and move her belongings, most of which were 
still in their boxes (new and mold-free) and piled in the 
corner of the hotel room. She looked forward to having 
some privacy on Tyler Street—and some peace.  

Rivera is letting herself enjoy the house, but she can’t 
yet cut ties with Northland. Until the portable vouchers 
get approved by HUD headquarters, she will continue 
using something called a “pass-through lease” to pay her 
rent—a temporary subsidy that is not part of Northland’s 
proposed voucher program. All tenants who have 
moved into their own apartments or houses currently 
use these leases, and in most cases, Northland has 
been paying about twelve hundred dollars a month for 
them, Marx said. Pass-throughs are part of a process that 
HUD usually reserves for those in the wake of a natural 
disaster. In this case, the disaster is Church Street  
South itself. 

Even though she’s settled in her new home, Rivera 
still feels the instability of relocation due to her 
financial dependency on Northland. She started 
cosmetology school to try to secure a more steady 
income. (Her hair had become a collage of bright 
red and brown since we first spoke in her room at the 
Premiere.) She’s worried that the house could become 
too expensive, even after she receives her voucher from 
Northland. If she has no other options, Rivera could 
potentially move back into an apartment complex like 
Church Street South. For her, this is the last resort—she 
recoils from even talking about her old home. 

She plans to host her mother-in-law, who’s coming 
from Pennsylvania, for Christmas this year. It will be a 
far cry from Thanksgiving, when half of her possessions 
were still in the hotel, the lease unsigned, and her 
husband sick with pneumonia. “Now, it’s kind of calm,” 
she tells me. “We good now.” 

Rivera’s situation represents the ideal outcome for the 
tenants, but she’s one of the early—and lucky—ones. 
She is now waiting, with fingers crossed, for the results 
of David Rosen’s lawsuit. “I know we’re gonna win this. 
It wasn’t our fault. We were dying, little by little, inside 
that place.” 

Armed with photos of mold stretched across her 
drywall, she says she’s ready to testify in court during 
the lawsuit. In one of them, something that looks like 
a mushroom sprouts from a kitchen wall. She goes 
back to Church Street South only to pick up the mail.  
“It’s dead over there,” she says. 

Church Street South, New Haven, Connecticut
From the ground, it’s clear why they call it the Jungle. 
Snow is either frozen into solid sheets or melted 
into dark, static pools in the mud. It congregates, too, 
around the more eerie relics of Church Street South’s 
late-sixties architecture: yellow stone cylinders sticking 
out of the ground; vacant cinderblock buildings with 
barred windows, and, in the middle of one courtyard, an 
inexplicable concrete monolith.

It’s easy to get lost in the Jungle, seemingly by design. 
The system of squat walls is so jumbled that you’ll 
find yourself in a corner, completely hidden to others 
in the complex or anyone on the street. Each dense 
building has cramped passageways running through it, 
dark even on a sunny afternoon. Amy Marx points to 
the rusting stairways, the dripping, icy pipes, and the 
trash collecting in abandoned yards. As she walks past 
Del Hoyo’s former yard gate (a wooden one, painted 
green with a yellow sun), someone sticks a head out of a 
parked minivan to yell, “Hey, that’s Amy Marx!” She has 
become a familiar face at the complex.

“I was just really speechless for a while,” she says of 
her first visit. “It was hard to believe that we had families 
in New Haven living in conditions that were so close to 
the places that all of us go, and yet so far from the reality 
of the rest of our lives.” 

She’s here to visit yet another family that has called 
her office. They live in a building called De Diego by 
the parking lot, and their apartment is bookended by 
ones that have been condemned. Black plywood covers 
the windows and doors here, too. Marx sighs. “It’s 
brutalism in disrepair.” 

Marx approaches a woman who is standing by the 
staircase, smoking a cigarette. 
“Hey there, I’m a legal aid,” Marx tells her. “Carolyn 
called me. Is she home? Do you have mold?”

The woman quickly finishes her cigarette. She nods. 
They walk upstairs and go inside.

Most, if not all, of the tenants will be relieved to close 
their Church Street South doors for the last time. But 
when they leave their apartments, they’ll also leave 
behind a place they called theirs. There’s pride in that 
sense of belonging. For over a thousand people, that 
pride is in jeopardy. In the meantime, they’ll be living 
in limbos—ones that are intact, dry, and without mold, 
but ones that certainly are not home.
