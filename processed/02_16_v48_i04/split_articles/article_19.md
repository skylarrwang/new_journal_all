room apartment in the city is high: $2,173. Though the 
Homebuyer Program has not caused the rents to sky-
rocket, it now sits in the uneasy position of handing out 
money without making a concentrated effort to direct 
it to places that truly need it the most.

Despite the changes in the city and the University, 
Yale touts the program as proudly as ever. “For more 
than two decades, the University has sought to engage 
in even more powerful ways with its neighbors,” says 
Morand, delivering a well-practiced speech in his deep 
baritone. “The Homebuyer Program is a key facet of 
this comprehensive engagement with our neighbors.” 
The program has attracted roughly thirty-five partici-
pants per year in the last few years, and the majority 
of those homeowners end up staying in their homes 
for a long term. In that sense, Morand says, it is a clear 
success. And participants in the program are, unsur-
prisingly, thrilled by the financial rewards and by more 
intangible benefits. 

“I definitely feel more vested in New Haven as a 
city,” says Sarah Kuebbing, a postdoctoral associate 
in the School of Forestry. She and her husband, Josh 
Galperin, who teaches at Yale Law School and the 
School of Forestry, bought their home in Beaver Hills 
after renting an apartment in East Rock. Even though 
they were already living in New Haven, looking to buy 
a home encouraged them to move outside of the “Yale 
Bubble,” as they referred to it several times during our 
interview. “I’m more interested in the community and 
the politics than I would be if I lived in East Rock,” she 
says. Owning a home in Beaver Hills allows the couple 
to take advantage of one of the greatest benefits of liv-
ing and working in New Haven—the short commute—
while also being able to become part of a close-knit 
community. On weekends, they spend much of their 
time working in their yard, which slopes high above 
the street and gives them a good vantage point from 
which they can talk to their neighbors next door and 
across the street. “They’re great neighbors,” says Dana 
Holahan, who lives next door to Galperin and Kueb-
bing. “They’re committed to making the neighborhood 
better.” Homeowners like Galperin and Kuebbing are 
exactly the type of “ambassadors” that Chauncey says 
the University hopes to dispatch through the Home-
buyer Program.

But while the ambassadors help Yale put forward a 
friendly face, DeStefano says housing is no longer the 
biggest problem that New Haven faces, and certainly 
not as big a problem as it was in 1994, at least as far as 
vacancies and rampant blight go. “The problem now 
is how we invest in young people, not how we invest 
in housing stock. I frankly happen to think that invest-
ment in core competencies of human capital around 
things like higher education, entrepreneurship … are 
more important,” DeStefano says. 	

After the end of her Thursday shift in the Berkeley 
dining hall, Annette Tracey leans forward in a chair in 
the common room and proudly flips through pictures 
of her home in Dixwell. “This is my back yard… This 
is my street…” she says, swiping quickly through sunny 
photos of her red-with-white-trim house on her phone. 
She leans back, her lipsticked mouth pulling back into 
a wide smile as she shakes her head, still in disbelief at 
her good fortune ten years after she bought her home. 
A happy-ending story like Tracey’s is certainly one of 
the biggest accomplishments of the Homebuyer Pro-
gram. Indeed, in the twenty-two years and counting 
of its existence, the Homebuyer Program has helped 
more than a thousand Yale employees buy homes and 
fulfill their “American Dreams,” as Tracey puts it. But 
the Homebuyer Program is essentially an investment, 
and as with any investment it is made because the 
investor plans to get something out of it. 

Morand concludes that one of the many functions 
of the Homebuyer Program today is “maintaining the 
momentum that New Haven has built over the last 
twenty years.” But when it comes to maintaining the 
momentum of the city’s tremendous comeback since 
the nineties, it is hard to see how the Homebuyer Pro-
gram, ill-suited to the city’s current needs in education 
and employment, could play a big role.
