the occasional memoir. I consumed them all in bulk, 
my curiosity driven by lingering pre-diagnostic doubt. 
(I still have an irrational fear that I’m faking it.) Our 
social circles overlapped at exactly one point. I asked 
our mutual friend to arrange a psychiatric blind date. 
It went well. We ate quickly and then, in a virtuo-
sic display of conformity to stereotype, lectured each 
other on the minutiae of our favorite science fiction 
franchises for almost six hours. Around midnight, 
we started talking case history. Like me, he also had 
ADHD, though he was diagnosed as a young child. In 
high school, they hadn’t believed he had a learning dis-
ability—his grades were too good.

That was less of a problem at Yale. The Resource 
Office on Disabilities offers two services to students 
with developmental disabilities: note taking, for lecture 
classes, and extended time on tests. Joshua used both. 
“The system was incredible,” he told me the last time 
we spoke. He had only one complaint. Many autistic 
people have a marked discrepancy between their verbal 
and quantitative abilities. Joshua, while gifted mathe-
matically, struggles with writing. He described the sus-
tained effort, even for a short paper, as almost physically 
painful. “I couldn’t take lots of courses I wanted to take 
and learn things that I thought would be valuable, in 
philosophy, the humanities, in public policy,” he said. 
Heavy writing requirements effectively prevented him 
from accessing much of the Yale curriculum. 

According to York, students also have access to tutor-
ing, writing assistance, and waivers on core require-
ments. This isn’t always conveyed to the students who 
might need these resources. Not all autistic or devel-
opmentally disabled students are registered with the 
resource office; of those who are (including myself), no 
one I spoke to had heard of these additional accommo-
dations. Personally, I’ve always found York and the rest 
of the resource office staff helpful, especially in seeking 
housing accommodations. For instance, I requested 
and received a single. Academics are harder. Univer-
sities are often less equipped than elementary or high 
schools to address individual autistic students’ very dif-
ferent needs, if only because the cases they encounter 
are fewer and less severe. “It seems unfair to call them 
unhelpful when they’re not really set up to deal with 
someone like me,” Elise said.  Her situation is Josh-
ua’s in reverse: quantitative skills that lag far behind 
her verbal ability. “The things they’re able to provide 
are not relevant to me. So I can’t really blame them for 
that. On the other hand, it was increasingly becoming 
clear that I had a problem fulfilling my science and 
math requirements, and they were patently unhelpful 
in figuring out what to do about it.” 

To find a solution for her particular problem, Elise 
had to bypass the office. After discovering that dyslexic 
students are allowed to use literature classes in transla-
tion to fulfill their foreign language requirement, she 
petitioned Yale for a similar substitution: she would 
take writing-based classes in economics as her QRs. 
“No one knew it was a thing you could do, and I was 
the first ever to have ever done it,” she said. “There was 
no institutional support.” Even so, she doesn’t think 
her autism is an academic liability. “Being an aspie 
is probably why I’m good at studying. It’s not in spite 
of it,” she told me. “I’m good at it because my brain  
works differently.”

Joshua’s worst problems were more social than aca-
demic. Though he got good grades, he struggled with 
social and organizational skills his classmates took for 
granted. He didn’t know how to socialize in a group, 
introduce himself to strangers, or ask girls out on dates. 
“Yale was set up to help me academically,” he told me, 
“but not in other ways. But I blame myself and my 
peers for that, more than the University.” 

When I was in eighth grade, my classmates were 
obsessed with a card game called Mau. The gimmick 
is that new players can’t be told any of the rules—they 
can only learn by being penalized for breaking them, 
and new ones are added every round. The whole thing 
is entertaining for about five minutes, after which you 
want to strangle the grinning adolescent sadist who 
invented it. It’s the best analogue I’ve ever come across 
for trying to have a social life while autistic. The only 
difference is that, in Mau, you won’t be ostracized for 
admitting you don’t know how to play.

Joshua is willing to learn the rules. In an ideal world, 
he said, “people would actively seek me out and strive 
to include me, would listen to me when I say things.” 
This admission made him nervous. Few needs are both 
more basic than companionship, and more impossible 
to demand of others. Joshua wanted to be part of a com-
munity without forcing himself to be the type of person 
it naturally embraced. “People will accuse me of ‘enti-
tlement’ for most of what I’ve said here. They’re right 
“Should we be getting 
treatment to conform 
ourselves to society, or 
should society expand 
its range of acceptable 
behavior?” 


in that I do think I’m entitled to it. I think everyone is 
entitled to it.” 

Zack Williams ’16, the president of SAAAY (Stu-
dents for Autism Awareness At Yale), is an expert on 
the question of autistic behavioral adjustment. His own 
experience with social skills training had been over-
whelmingly positive. That’s why he wants to complete 
an MD/Ph.D. in neuroscience, specializing in autism 
treatment. “I don’t like ABA or anything like that,” he 
said, naming Applied Behavioral Analysis, a common 
behavioral therapy, widely opposed in the autistic com-
munity for its abuse potential and excessive focus on 
normalization. But he says, “exhibiting an autism-like 
behavior is going to impair their social functioning.” 

Behavioral intervention is a divisive issue. Elise, 
among others, takes the opposing view. “I know there’s 
a lot of disagreement—Zack and I have this argument 
all the time.  Should we be getting treatment to con-
form ourselves to society, or should society expand its 
range of acceptable behavior?” She shook her head. 
“Maybe it’s because I was diagnosed so late—I’ve been 
doing all this work, now you guys can do some work 
and adapt.”

That was when I realized I was making an effort to 
avoid her eyes. The same thing had happened when I 
met Joshua. Both times, I’d found myself anxious not 
to look too normal. After years spent learning body 
language’s most common dialect, I’d forgotten how to 
move and act and speak unnaturally—that is to say, 
like an autistic person. I tend to agree more with Elise, 
if only because it’s unsettling to think how much of 
my behavior is adapted from parents and teachers and 
occupational therapists in an attempted regression to 
the behavioral mean. 

Social skills are always learned, even if most people 
don’t take notes. It’s harder for me, and I work harder 
to compensate. But I can choose to socialize with the 
people who meet me halfway. That gets easier as the 
world gets bigger. Joshua is happier since graduation 
from Yale. “It’s a combination of a change in meds, 
being with people who shared my values, and being 
more mature,” he said. “Not sure how much of each.” 

I’m lucky enough to have found close friends at Yale, 
as are Elise and Zack. “Everything before Yale was a lot 
worse,” Elise said. “I have a lot more friends now than 
I did then. A lot of it is we are incredibly nerdy gener-
ally. We are a university of nerdy people. I went to a 
very small high school. There were fifty people over six 
years. How many nerds is that? Like four.” 

“Nerdy” is an interesting proxy for autistic. In defi-
ance of taste and popular opinion, some of us don’t 
even watch Star Trek. But before “nerdy” connoted 
awkward, persecuted schoolyard intellectualism, it just 
meant weird—and that’s in the most pejorative sense. 
(A similar alchemy has affected the word “geek,” which 
originally referred to a circus performer who bit the 
heads off live chickens). For all the benefits and draw-
backs of our neurotype, the costs and consequences, 
I’m most defensive of our involuntary idiosyncrasies. 

Elise said it more concretely: “On the one hand, I 
made spreadsheets of my toys when I was 7. But how 
many 7-year-olds know how to make spreadsheets?”

TV autism—think Sherlock Holmes or Spock—is all 
social isolation and dazzling brilliance, as if the two 
could balance each other out. In real life, though, neu-
rochemistry doesn’t have to play fair. My autism isn’t a 
good thing or a bad thing, it’s just me.
