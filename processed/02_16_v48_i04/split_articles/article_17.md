“You can come if you want,” Emma adds, as an  
afterthought. 

We enter the building through the trash room and 
climb the stairs to her third-floor suite, where she lives 
with her friend Claire. Emma lets me in and goes off, 
saying she’ll be back soon. In the meantime I turn on 
the lights and go into the kitchen, where I open all 
the cabinets and drawers one at a time. Between Claire 
and Emma there are ten mugs, two handfuls of orna-
mented forks and spoons, and one slim knife. Inside 
one cabinet I find twelve types of tea, several of which 
are labeled “for women.” I decide on a cup of Women’s 
Chai. I press the home button on my phone repeated-
ly—I like to see it light up—and wait for the tea to boil. 
I’m going to study her when she comes back. I’ll 
inspect her eyes, and watch her person for a smelly 
pouch or a plastic bag. But her hands are empty 
when I see her; her jeans don’t even have any pock-
ets. She goes into her room and tells me she has to get 
some reading done. “It’s only the first day of break,” 
I say. Already, she’s with Persuasion, wrapping herself  
in blankets.

My mother, Susan, is a Chinese woman whose ability 
to find and befriend other Chinese women, including 
Emma’s mother, Shirley, will one day be revealed as 
an advanced form of echolocation. Susan and Shirley 
met in line waiting to pick us up from the first day of 
first grade. At Emma’s house, Susan and Shirley drank 
tea in the dining room while a floor below Emma and I 
decided we liked each other over a tub of one thousand 
Legos. That’s how friendship happens when you’re 
smaller: you presume it. The older you get, the longer 
it takes to be sure that someone is on your side. I’d call 
of the sprawling tapas menu. When we’re splitting the 
bill I think suddenly about what my dad is always say-
ing, that Emma’s father is a doctor who could afford 
to buy our entire neighborhood and still have change 
for pizza, and how that’s probably not true and anyway 
it’s a bad thought to think, but I can’t help that I’ve 
thought it.

In the car I realize I wasn’t even all that hungry, just 
tired. I was up until 4 a.m. scanning other people’s 
writing into an online database for a writing contest, 
crouched beside a finicky, old, all-in-one printer with 
hundreds of pages to go. The overhead light was dim, 
and my roommate had inexplicably packed up all the 
lamps, so I worked in the dark. Everyone I knew had 
left campus. When the machine sputtered, I patted it 
as if I were consoling a child. From beneath the glass 
snuck bursts of light that I thought were trying to tell 
me something. 

I wasn’t supposed to be looking at any of the submis-
sions because contest staff were to remain impartial, 
but of course I read everything I happened to see as if it 
were addressed to me. The last story was eighteen pages 
about a father and his son, who is a musician. The dedi-
cation, at the top of one cream-colored page, read “For 
Charles.” I wondered if Charles knew about this story, 
and if he did, whether he enjoyed it, or if he was put off 
by how self-consciously constructed it came across. But 
when I reread it imagining I was Charles, I was moved.

Emma is an English major, like me, except she wants 
to be a doctor, unlike me. She spent the last semester 
abroad in Dublin taking courses on medieval British 
literature because the upper-level courses on Joyce 
were closed to transfer students. In Dublin, she met 
Mason, who is taking some time off from art college in 
Tennessee to engage more fully in his jazz death metal 
band. When I hear this, I nod convulsively to show her 
how open-minded I have become. She doesn’t have 
any photos of Mason, only photos of her taken by him 
on her phone. They’re all black and white. She’s sitting 
on a brick wall strewn with graffiti, looking at the cam-
era, at him, and now at me, sort of.

Emma pulls into the parking lot next to her dorm, 
a stout building in beige. She’s a good driver, and fits 
her car into a tiny space like she’s threading a needle. 
Then she shuts off the music, this thrashing electron-
ica that she’s kept muzzled at a low volume. “We can 
go up, then I’m going to pick up my weed,” she says, 
yanking the key out of the ignition. The heat in the car 
lingers, but I feel the incoming cold even beneath my 
down jacket, two sweaters, and the last t-shirt in the 
clean pile, which I received at the conclusion of my 
high school AP United States History class and reads 
“Four Score and Seven Assignments Ago...”

most of my earliest acquaintances “elevator friends.” 
These are people you’d never meet if it weren’t for 
repeated happenstance in intimate spaces, until one 
day you’re trying to call your house and you call their 
house instead.

When we were smaller, Emma wasn’t allowed to 
bring her toys upstairs. We spent most of our time play-
ing in the basement, where I accidentally broke a lot of 
things. Worst of all was a scale Lego model of Dumb-
ledore’s study that took her weeks to build. She didn’t 
seem angry, but she refused to let me put the pieces 
back in order. “Everything you touch, you break,” she 
said, pressing a yellow tile into the place it had been 
moments ago. That’s not true, I protested. It was a little 
true. Once I was alone in her basement inspecting a 
paper model of an ornate Chinese junk when one of 
the sails broke off in my hand. I was so surprised and 
upset I almost yelled. But I didn’t want to her to dis-
cover what I had done, so I kept quiet and buried the 
pieces in a crate full of books beneath her desk. Why 
did people bother making things if they were going  
to break?

Emma’s silky lavender blanket is bunched around 
her knees. I haven’t brought anything to do, so I sit in 
her chair and open the small black notebook I carry 
around to a clean page. I’m in an introductory fiction 
class and have a story due the week after break. On 
Emma’s desk is a photocopy of E. M. Forster’s Aspects 
of the Novel. Chapter Three: Plot. “‘The king died and 
then the queen died’ is a story. ‘The king died, and 
then the queen died of grief’ is a plot.” A story, Forster 
writes, makes you ask “And then?” and a plot makes you  
ask “Why?” 

I’ve been considering writing about a florist who has 
ceased to leave his shop and lives surrounded by over-
grown houseplants. He makes his final sale, a bouquet 
of gardenias, to a woman who has axed her way through 
the shrubbery. Once he loved her. Then he suffocates 
on a daffodil. “And then?” “Why?” I get distracted. 
The snow starting outside seems unnecessary. There 
is already enough of it, these stout mounds brooding 
around the edges of Emma’s building like they’re wait-
ing to be invited in.

At around 9 p.m., a girl enters without knocking and 
paws through Emma’s sparse wardrobe. The three of 
us go downstairs, where five of Emma’s other friends 
are already sitting knee-to-knee in a circle on Hannah’s 
small floor planning their road trip to Buku, which 
I learned earlier is a music festival in New Orleans. 
There is a tie-dyed dreamcatcher the size of a pocket-
watch dangling off a hanger in Hannah’s open closet, 
the sort of thing you buy at a street fair and forget about. 
In one trip scenario they’re going to spend a night 
in Atlanta and a night in Nashville on the way back. 
In another they’re staying a day in Houston, two days 
in New Orleans instead of one, and eating dinner with 
Martin’s sister in Richmond. At one point Martin has 
tacked on an extra ten hours to their driving time with 
the addition of a stop at the Mexican border. “Martin,” 
Emma says, after which her friends laugh and drop 
the idea. She’s only lying on Hannah’s bed looking at 
her phone, but she’s definitely the one in charge. The 
group sticks little red circles across the map like they’re 
spreading a pox. Around midnight Emma says she’s had 
enough and we decide it’s time to leave.

After Emma falls asleep, I go for a walk around her 
hallway and find a place to pace between the balcony 
and the vending machine. My phone starts vibrating. 
I see Home calling and don’t pick up. It’s my mom. 
She wants to know where I am. No one I know knows 
where I am, except for Emma. I like it that way. Every 
year I tell myself I’m not going back, and every year I 
hate myself for walking in the front door, taking off my 
sneakers by stepping on their backs the way my high 
school track coach said you’re not supposed to—it’s 
bad for your ankles—and taking my seat on the living 
room couch like it’s been reserved for me. I lean really 
far over the balcony, which is about a story and a half 
above the laundry room, and think about being reck-
less. If people were looking for me, where would they 
look first? Bang on my door, then check the library, 
the classroom I study in and have privately dubbed “A 
Room of My Own,” the coffee shop where I and a thou-
sand other people have spent their time.

I’m pretty bad at hide-and-seek. I was tall long before 
the other kids in first grade were tall, which made hid-
ing behind even the highest chairs or play castle walls 
difficult. So I sought walk-in closets, cabinets, once 
even a narrow pantry crammed with Italian herbed

tomatoes, which made me feel like I was in a cave of 
little hearts. I wondered what would happen if I fell 
over this ledge and when Emma would realize, if it 
would take minutes, or hours, or the terrifying possibil-
ity of a year. And I wondered why the people we care 
about don’t just somehow know when bad things have 
happened to us without us having to tell them, why 
that’s not a sense anyone thought we needed to have. 
“Jenny,” I hear. My mother; I’ve picked up. “Where 
are you? Is it snowing where you are? It’s snowing here.” 
We’re both quiet, like we’re stopped at a light and wait-
ing for the other to go. “The snow looks like flour,” she 
says. “Someone had an accident in the kitchen if that’s 
true,” I finally respond. “That was a joke,” I add, when 
there’s silence.

The snow really does look like flour. I’m looking out 
the window next to the balcony where you can see the 
snow falling. That big, innocent backyard. “Where are 
you?” my mother asks again. “Are you coming home 
soon?” She misses me. She says she misses me every 
time she looks at the snow. I don’t tell her I’m coming 
home. I haven’t decided if I will yet, but in three days 
I’ll be back on my parents’ couch. 

The next morning Emma drops me off at the shuttle 
stop going back to Yale. We hug and I tell her to keep 
in touch. While I wait, I listen to other people calling 
their doctors about appointments. Hi it’s Jane, Hi it’s 
Matthew, Hi it’s Duncan, just confirming for Monday, 
Wednesday, Thursday. I wonder if any of the calls are 
serious, if anyone might have cancer or a grandmother 
dying, and I feel immediately guilty. 

It’s cold outside, and I don’t get back until late. I 
unlock the door to my room and switch on the over-
head light. As usual it does not turn on when requested, 
but takes its time, sliding into brightness. When it 
finally does turn on, the light is ungenerous, showing 
me everything exactly as I left it.
