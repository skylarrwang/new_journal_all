WHEN YALE MOVES IN
Has a university program meant to stabilize the city  
become a publicity stunt?
Natalie Yang
A dramatic exposé published in a 1994 issue of GQ 
magazine lamented that Yale was about to cheer 
its “Last Boola Boola.” The pre-apocalyptic article 
described an institution whose sluggish endowment 
struggled amid a “war zone of poverty, crime, and 
drugs as frightening as any American city.” New Haven 
was hauling itself out of a recession, and while the city 
and Yale were certainly not quite as rotten as the arti-
cle made it seem, the bad press was an indicator of the 
University’s declining public image.

It was true that bad blood between Yale and New 
Haven had existed for decades. “Twenty-five to for-
ty-five years ago, there was a time when the president 
of Yale and the mayor of New Haven wouldn’t even 
speak to each other,” remembers Sam Chauncey ’57 
who served as the University’s vice president and secre-
tary under President Richard Levin GRD ’74. The 1991 
murder of Christian Prince, a fourth-generation Yale 
student who was shot through the heart on Hillhouse 
Avenue, shocked the Yale community. His was the first 
murder of a Yale student on campus since 1974. Even 
as it highlighted the gulf between the campus and the 
rest of the city, Prince’s murder served as a reminder 
that Yale was inseparable from New Haven.

The Yale Homebuyer Program was a product of this 
turbulent time, when the Elm City and its wealthiest 
institution shared a bleak outlook but seemingly lit-
tle else. Less than a year after his inauguration, Levin 
announced the initiative: any Yale employee who 
bought a house in New Haven would receive two 
thousand dollars per year for ten years to help offset 
the city’s hefty property tax. Modeled after similar pro-
grams at Columbia and the University of Chicago, the 
program was designed to simultaneously stabilize the 
University’s workforce and address the city’s blight. “It 
asked, how can we promote efforts that create fierce 
neighborhood 
loyalty 
through 
homeownership?” 
remembers former mayor John DeStefano, who was 
sworn in four months after the program began. Today, 
the Yale Homebuyer Program has declining relevance 
for New Haven, but it remains a centerpiece of Yale’s 
sloganeering about its investment in the city.

According to The New York Times, in 1994, when 
the Homebuyer Program was founded, only about 
thirty percent of Yale’s employees lived in New Haven. 
Yale employees met the program with a mix of praise 
and trepidation. For some, the program was a wel-
come incentive to move into New Haven. For others, 
it wasn’t enough to make the city seem safe. Dee Dee 
Emery, a food service worker who rented an apartment 
in New Haven, and whose son had been shot and killed 
the year before, told the Associated Press in July of that 
year that she still wanted to move out of the city. “Any-
where away from here,” she said. But others jumped at 
the financial benefits. “If it weren’t for Yale’s assistance, 
we wouldn’t be looking [for a home] in New Haven,” 
Richard Gold, a professor at the School of Drama, told 
the Yale Daily News in October 1994. 

Despite the initial ambivalence, the program was 
quickly lauded. “Homebuyer Program Succeeds,” 
declared a headline in the Yale Daily News just four 
months after the program’s launch. Today, more than a 
thousand Yale employees have bought homes through 
the program. The Yale Corporation has renewed fund-
ing for the Homebuyer Program every two years since 
its inception, most recently the past December. Each 
renewal is marked by the publication of an upbeat arti-
cle in the University-run site YaleNews, boasting the 
University’s commitment to the city and highlighting 
the stories of a few satisfied new homebuyers. For the 
program’s twentieth anniversary in 2014, the  Yale Daily 
News called it one of President Levin’s “most widely 
acclaimed town-gown initiatives.” 

According to the 2010 census, New Haven had the 
largest population growth of any city in New England 
over the previous decade. New Haven’s crime rates 
hit a twenty-year low the same year, and today New 
Haven has one of the lowest vacancy rates in the coun-
try, according to the Hartford Courant. Luxury apart-
ment buildings are popping up in response to the 
high demand for housing. But at the same time, says 
Jim Paley, executive director of Neighborhood Hous-
ing Services, “We have a great disparity between more 
affluent people in New Haven and poor people.”

Homes in wealthy neighborhoods, continues Paley, 
have had fairly stable value on the housing market. 
Those in lower income neighborhoods, though, have 
seen a precipitous fall when the economy declines.

The question to consider, then, is what role the 
Homebuyer Program plays in a city that is very differ-
ent from the city of twenty years ago. Since 1994, Yale 
has committed more than $28 million to the Home-
buyer Program. The program has produced over a 
thousand happy poster children who, as Chauncey 
points out, can go on to be “ambassadors for Yale” in 
their neighborhoods. And with these many beneficia-
ries and the good press that has followed each biennial 
renewal, the Homebuyer Program is an opportunity for 
Yale to profess a commitment to New Haven. It’s clear 
that the program serves Yale. It’s less clear that it still 
serves New Haven. 

May Brantley stands at the front door of her home 
surveying the busy rain-slicked road on a November 
morning. The street is lined on one side with color-
ful houses whose azure and lime-green paint peels 
in small patches. On the other side of the street are 
several small apartment buildings with uniform win-
dows that seem to repeat endlessly down the street. 
Brantley, a lifelong New Haven resident who works 
in Yale’s Theater Studies Department, purchased her 
home in the Dwight neighborhood two years ago. “All 
I could say was wow,” she remembers, recreating the 
open-mouthed look of delight she wore when she first 
walked into the house. 

From her vantage point on the couch, she points 
out all the things she loves about her home: a small 
stained-glass window, her collection of potted plants, 
a fireplace stocked with logs, stairs leading to a spa-
cious bedroom. She has a room for her mother to stay 
in when she is visiting, and a backyard that is large 
enough for family barbecues. She had been planning 
to leave New Haven until she heard about the Home-
buyer Program. “I was going to move to Hamden,” she 
says as the television plays softly in the background. 
“They have much lower taxes there.” The benefit pro-
vided by the Homebuyer Program, though, was enough 
to at least partly offset the high property taxes she has  
to pay.

Homebuyer Program has two primary target audiences: 
people who live outside New Haven and might not 
have considered moving into the city, and people who 
rent in New Haven and need assistance or incentive 
to buy a home. Brantley, who fits into the second cat-
egory, is a model beneficiary of the program: a native 
of the Elm City who could afford to purchase a home 
thanks to Yale, and as a result promotes stability in the 
Dwight neighborhood. 

When Brantley bought her home two years ago, the 
program had gone through around ten renewals and 
modifications. When it first began, employees could 
receive the benefit if they bought a home anywhere in 
New Haven. After the first two years, it was limited to 
only homes purchased in parts of East Rock, Beaver 
Hills, Wooster Square, Dixwell, Newhallville, Dwight, 
the Hill, and West Rock. Specific areas of the latter 
five neighborhoods are federally designated “empow-
erment zones” in need of economic development. 
Fair Haven, which does not include an empowerment 
zone, was also added to the Homebuyer Program in 
2003 at the request of union contract negotiators to 
accommodate employees who wanted to live in a pri-
marily Latino neighborhood. Now, eligible employ-
ees—professors with appointments of at least one year 
and permanent staff who work at least twenty hours per 
week—can receive up to a total of thirty thousand dol-
lars, paid in installments over ten years.

Though the Yale Homebuyer Program includes mul-
tiple empowerment zones, there is one area of partic-
ular focus. The University offers a $5,000 additional 
credit to individuals who purchase homes in Dixwell, 
the neighborhood immediately northwest of the new 
residential colleges, which are scheduled for comple-
tion by 2017. Dixwell currently has lower crime and 
poverty rates than both Newhallville and the Hill. 
Yale, however, offers no extra incentive to homebuy-
ers in those latter two neighborhoods. By contrast, the 
Neighborhood Housing Service, a New Haven-based 
organization that provides a wide range of programs 
to support new homeowners with down-payment assis-
tance and homebuyer education programs, specifically 
targets Newhallville and parts of the Hill for its housing 
renovations and support, but not Dixwell. Neighbor-
hood Housing Services’ Jim Paley says his organization 
focuses on areas where money can have the greatest 
impact. “A lot of areas in Dixwell have come back very 
strong,” he explains, contrasting it with Newhallville 
and the Hill. “I think Yale is selecting Dixwell because 
it is just adjacent to where the new residential colleges 
are being built.” 

One way of reading Yale’s selection of neighbor-
hoods, says Chloe Taft, a postdoctoral associate in the 
American Studies department who teaches a course on 
the history of housing in America, is to conclude that 
Yale has chosen the empowerment zones as areas that 
could particularly benefit from increased homeowner-
ship and the investment it would bring. “On the other 
hand,” she continues, “Yale has an interest in creating 
buffer zones” by investing specifically in the areas that 
border the campus, creating more stability through 
homeownership in an area, like Dixwell, that is close to 
student housing.

Yale’s focus on empowerment zone neighborhoods 
also contributes to subtle shifts in the demograph-
ics of communities surrounding the University. “The 
Homebuyer Program is gentrification in that it implies 
investment in the community,” says Elihu Rubin, an 
assistant professor at the Yale School of Architecture. 
“The dark side of that, though, is displacement.” As 
homebuyers purchase homes and go on to live in them 
instead of renting them out, a house that might have 
once been rented out at an affordable rate is no longer 
on the market, reducing supply and, considered on a 
large scale, gradually raising prices.

DeStefano points out that New Haven’s housing 
problem today—now that the rate of home vacancies 
has been brought down significantly—is the avail-
ability of affordable housing. “The community that is 
feeling squeezed by the development of market-rate 
housing feels like we need to have policy that pre-
serves affordable housing,” he says. Bridgette Russell, 
director of the Homeownership Center of the Neigh-
borhood Housing Services, points out that New Haven 
has become a target for real estate investors because 
of its low vacancy rates—2.1 percent, according to the 
New York-based real estate research firm Reis—and 
high rents. According to a 2014 report by the City of 
New Haven, the average monthly rate for a two-bed-
For the program’s
