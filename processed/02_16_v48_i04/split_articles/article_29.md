individual tables, facing their clients. To my left, a few 
rows of chairs form a waiting area where people pass 
the time until they’re called up for their appointment 
with destiny. Someone is playing gauzy New Age music 
from an old iPod. Most of the people look old enough 
to be my parents or grandparents. 

Inside, I reach for my wallet and realize I have 
no cash. “Do you take —” I start to ask. “Yes,” says 
Reverend Robert Stempson. He’s been organizing 
these psychic fairs since 1984, through his for-profit 
business, the Programs for Human Development. PHD 
puts on four psychic fairs a month across Connecticut. 
Stempson doesn’t sit behind a crystal ball; he has a 
MacBook and a cash register. His white hair and beard, 
combined with a checkered button-down shirt and 
khakis, make him look like a high school principal on 
his day off. He swipes my debit card. Fifteen dollars for 
fifteen minutes. I am a little poorer, but I figure it’s a 
small price to pay to resolve The Future. 

My first interaction is a disaster. Starr, a medium 
wearing librarian chic—lilac shirt underneath a 
lavender cardigan—sits behind a table covered with 
Dragon’s Blood herbs, Magic Pagan incense, a Hindu 
om charm, a crucified Jesus, a seated Buddha. I just want 
to interview her, but then she tries to squeeze in some 
psychic predictions. She made one banal observation 
(I like to write, go figure—I’m carrying a notebook). 
And then she goes for it: “You got a grandmother that 
was a slave. Do you know about it?”  I try not to roll 
my eyes. My grandparents all live in Nigeria. No one 
in my family was ever a slave. And besides, even if my 
family were American, my grandmother would have to 
be approximately 150 years old to have been a slave in 
this country. Millennials do a lot of things well, and 
one of them is refusing to put up with weird racial 
commentary from old white people. Some people may 
say that this means we are “coddled.” I feel bad for these 
people—they didn’t get to grow up in my America. 

When I return to Stempson to choose my reading, the 
Tarot is on my mind. A few weeks ago I acquired a little 
book called The Symbolism of the Tarot: Philosophy 
of the Occultism in Pictures and Numbers, originally 
published in Russia in 1913 by a mathematician and 
“esotericist” named P.D. Ouspensky. He explains 
that the Tarot is a pack of fifty-six cards divided into 
four suits (scepters, cups, swords, and pentacles), plus 
twenty-two more numbered cards with special names 
like The High Priestess and The Hanged Man. 
According to Ouspensky, the Tarot is no game. It is a 
diagram of the universe. In the center, there’s a single 
card: The Fool, representing man. The twenty-one 
other named cards are placed around it, in a triangle 
with seven cards on each side. This is the Christian 
Trinity—God. On the outside, the fifty-six remaining 
cards form a square, representing the physical universe. 
That is to say: everything is the Tarot and the Tarot 
is everything.  

I scan through the options on Stempson’s table: 
Barbara S. reads the stars, James is a clairvoyant and 
medium (and does a lot of readings with a blindfold on), 
Ivory reads playing cards, and Barbara D. is a medium 
and a pet psychic. I wonder what sort of person would 
want to have a conversation with their dead parakeet or 
Pekingese. Then I see Heather: warm brown eyes and 
a kind face that patients must be happy to see at the 
hospital where she works as a nurse. And she reads the 
Tarot. Heather’s the one. 

I sit down across from her and shuffle the cards, 
clumsily. I’ve never met with a psychic before. It’s 
the sort of activity that my immigrant parents would 
consider haram, or at least highly suspicious. 

I make three equal-sized stacks with the cards 
facing down. I pull one card from each stack and 
then place it on top, facing up. I will do this four 
times in our fifteen-minute session: The Future in 
twelve cards. First, a wizened old man holding a staff 
and a glowing lantern. “The Hermit is going within, 
having a lot of a connection to spirit,” Heather says. 
“When you go to sleep at night you can ask spirit to 
help you to answer questions or to take you where you 
want to go.” But to this day, my dreams remain a mix 
of petty embarrassments (sleeping through finals) and 
embarrassing absurdities (Justin Bieber is my next door 
neighbor and we go surfing together).  

I pull the Ace of Pentacles, a hand reaching through 
a white cloud and holding a glowing sphere. “This is 
a new beginning coming with money,” Heather says. 
Thank god. Here, I almost insert a quip about how little 
money is in my Wells Fargo account. I imagine myself 
spinning around in a shower of $100 and $50 bills, 
grinning. Spirit, you are too kind.  

In a second, Heather holds up the Page of Cups, a 
young guy grasping a golden goblet. She asks if I’m 
dating anyone right now. I hesitate. “Kind of,” I say. 
I am in a thing right now, after becoming a little too 
comfortable with the rhythmic swiping of Tinder. But 
this thing is missing an emotional center. Out loud, 
it’s easy to blame hookup culture—why don’t we care 
about true romance? But that’s just me parroting the 
typical line. In all honesty, I wonder if I’m incapable 
of affection. 

“There’s more of a love relationship coming in for 
you,” Heather says after I pull the Two of Cups. “A 
heart connection.” It’s not like Heather gives me a 
name or a date. But: Love, actually…Eventually. The

rational me says that this is an obvious conclusion: of 
course I would find love, most people do. But I have to 
admit that I feel relief wash over me.

As the remaining fifteen minutes turn into ten 
and then five, Justice tells me that what I’m studying 
is “meant to be.” Eight of Swords says I need to stop 
worrying so much, and The Hanged Man assures 
me that, with my divine connection, I will get the  
answers in time. 

The psychics are purveyors of suspended disbelief. 
Optimism is so elusive because pessimism—about the 
depressing lunacy of our politics, the catastrophe of 
climate change, the persistence of religious extremism, 
the ambient fear of gun massacres—feels like it has 
been the underlying emotion in the United States for 
the past couple of decades (as long as I’ve been alive). 
That pessimism has seeped from the national narrative 
into our own lives. 

The psychic fair offers instant validation. All you 
have to do is hand over a bit of money—and what’s 
more American than that? 

As I sit in the hotel lobby, watching my Uber inch 
closer to me on the virtual map, I think about why I 
came here: to see what the psychics could offer a young 
person from this generation, cultured by snark streaked 
with sincerity, raised during a tumultuous time. At the 
fairs, I ran into only a couple of people my age; the 
prime demographic seemed to be middle-aged women 
who burn a lot of incense. But in a single afternoon, 
I had been promised that someone will love me, that 
I will be rich, that I’m on the right path. While my 
political science courses tell me that good public 
policy is the only way to save America from flaming 
ruin, perhaps what I need is the optimism of the Tarot.
