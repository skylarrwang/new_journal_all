On psychic fairs, the tarot, and millennial angst
I am a twenty-year-old college junior and terrible 
at making decisions—the sort of person who agonizes 
for an hour about which pack of white socks to buy 
on Amazon. I have a handle on my immediate future; 
the rainbow tiles of my Google Calendar are a warm, 
constant presence in my life. But beyond tomorrow 
or next week or next month, I am at a loss as to how to 
make Decisions about The Future. People say follow your 
dreams, but I am not destined to become Aziz Ansari’s 
personal assistant. I have tried going to Yale’s Office of 
Career Strategy, but the well-meaning people there ask 
way too many questions: What do you want to do? What 
are your passions? If I knew, I would not have trekked half 
a mile to their office in the first place.

As twentysomethings growing up in this era, we 
are privileged to have so many more options than 
our parents. (Amazon offers 348,353 search results for 
“white socks.”) But, sometimes, too much choice can 
be paralyzing. For this reason, I have decided to see  
the psychics. 

In early November, I travel to two weekend psychic 
fairs. The first is in the Best Western Plus hotel in 
North Haven, which exudes the sort of muted despair 
I associate with bland, you-could-be-anywhere-in-
America architecture. The second is in the Hyatt 
Regency in Greenwich, whose lobby is comically ritzy, 
filled with trees that reach up two stories, climbing vines, 
shrubs, a lazy river, a pond, a waterfall, and glowing 
lanterns. I Instagram it immediately. Outside each hotel 
is a small lawn sign staked a foot from the highway:  
Psychic Fair Today!

Psychics don’t have the best reputation. If we 
examine the foundation of our shared cultural memory, 
Harry Potter, we find a typical portrayal of the psychic: 
Professor Sybill Trelawney. She bumbles around 
Hogwarts with her crystal balls, making predictions 
that range from the laughably vague to the absurdly 
alarmist, serving mostly as comic relief.

In the real world, high-profile seers don’t get much 
respect, either. Nancy Reagan consulted the stars before 
making any important decisions—for that reason, her 
husband’s 1967 swearing in as governor of California 
took place at 12:10 a.m. Later, an embarrassed President 
Reagan insisted to reporters, “No policy or decision in 
my mind has ever been influenced by astrology.”  (Too 
bad—maybe the constellations could have saved us 
from trickle-down economics.) 

In the best case, I will leave these hotel lobbies with 
clear next steps. In the worst case, I’ll find myself in 
a small room with a bunch of Sybill Trelawneys. But 
remember: Professor Trelawney was wrong ninety-nine 
percent of the time. The other one percent of the time, 
she did indeed have the power to prophesize. 

When I get to the Best Western, I take a picture with 
the psychic fair sign for my Snapchat Story. This is 
partly to announce what a cool Saturday I’m having 
and partly to leave the police a precise geographic 
location of my whereabouts in case the Spirits don’t 
want to let me go. I gather my courage, step through 
the sliding glass doors, and head inside. I walk into a 
small conference room decorated in chain-hotel chic.
