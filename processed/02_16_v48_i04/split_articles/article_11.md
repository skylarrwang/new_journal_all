When two groups of Yale Law students arrived in 
Dilley and Karnes, Texas, in the spring of 2015, the 
detention centers they saw housed over two thousand 
asylum seekers. The people inside were overwhelm-
ingly women and children fleeing rising violence in 
Central America’s Northern Triangle, and the volun-
teers intended to help them stay in the United States. 
They were there to conduct interviews, to ask the fam-
ilies what they had experienced that would help them 
win their cases in front of a government judge. 

Swapna Reddy LAW ’16 described the first center 
she visited as a “jail made out of trailers.” The Yale Law 
students saw asylum seekers locked twelve to a room in 
crowded cells. They talked to mothers whose children 
had vomited for several days straight; when they asked 
for assistance, the center’s medical staff prescribed 
more water. Many of the pro-bono lawyers working at 
Dilley, Reddy told me, called it “baby jail.” They set 
up makeshift offices to record women’s informal tes-
timonies about their persecution while their children 
watched cartoons or made up games about court pro-
ceedings, miming the lawyers.  

The detention centers at Karnes and Dilley have 
been criticized for their bleak conditions. The govern-
ment’s response is that it had to deal quickly with the 
unanticipated migrant surges. Most of the migrants 
from El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala fled gang 
violence to cross the Rio Grande and make it into the 
U.S. The Karnes center had been open since 2010, and 
it could hold five hundred people. The one in Dilley 
opened in December 2014, after a historic spike in the 
number of asylum seekers. It is the biggest in the coun-
try, with a maximum capacity of 2,400. Both centers are 
operated by private prison corporations. 

Reddy and the four others on the trip assisted one 
asylum seeker through a successful hearing and many 
others with their preliminary interviews. When they 
returned to New Haven, Reddy and Conchita Cruz 
LAW ’16 formed the Yale Asylum Seekers Advocacy 
Project (ASAP) to continue their work from afar—
poring over intake files, reading transcripts of inter-
views with officials, and conducting phone interviews 
to prepare the information the lawyers on the ground  
would need.

The initial asylum process has three stages: a prelim-
inary interview to establish “credible fear” (a legal term 
indicating the asylum seeker has reason to fear for her 
life should she return to her home country), a “mer-
its” hearing (where the immigration judge makes a first 
decision about the credibility of the asylum case), and 
a final hearing. Around August 2015, the government 
began releasing asylum seekers on bond after the initial 
interview, with only a letter following them to notify 
them of the hearings that would occur many months 
later. Previously, it had held them at the centers for 
longer periods before releasing them. There was a fatal 
flaw in the government’s plan: hundreds of families did
