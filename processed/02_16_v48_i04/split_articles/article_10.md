EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The magician slowly slices the grapefruit in half 
with a large knife. He pries the halves apart, juice 
running down his hands. Wedged in the center of 
the grapefruit is a dollar bill, which he was holding 
just seconds before. The audience around the table 
applauds, enjoying the opening act of a nightlong din-
ner spectacle. Alone in the kitchen, the chef and mas-
termind of the evening quietly prepares the first course 
of the meal. 

Every Friday night, junior Abdel Morsy cooks an 
elaborate dinner for twelve people. Sometimes the 
invitees know each other; often they do not. For one 
evening, they sit around a gleaming wood table at what 
Morsy calls “The Sticker Shop.” (The location, he 
insists, must be kept secret.) 

Morsy doesn’t formally promote The Sticker Shop—
it’s a purely word-of-mouth phenomenon. He invites 
most people personally, but others email him in the 
hope of getting a seat at his table. He’s also invited his 
Uber drivers, train conductors, and barber. 

The premise of The Sticker Shop is that guests pay 
not for a meal, but for an intricate sticker that Morsy’s 
graphic design team creates each week. It’s a way to 
avoid the legal restrictions of being a restaurant, but 
Morsy says that it’s also the celebration of an art form 
“as lowly as the sticker.” His humble stickers certainly 
aren’t cheap—each has a “suggested donation” of 
twenty to sixty dollars, though Morsy is willing to take a 
loss per head if someone cannot pay in full.

The food is the centerpiece of the project but not 
its essence. “Every artistic expression is valid at the 
dinner table,” Morsy says. Each night begins with a 
short performance—music, magic, or another art form. 
The magician performing the grapefruit trick was 
a Yale student and a friend of Morsy’s from the Yale  
Magic Society. 

A square of votive candles flickers in the middle of 
the table. Behind me, a white floor-to-ceiling bookshelf 
holds elegantly arranged objects: knuckles of ginger, a 
row of glowing onions, two packages of ramen noodles, 
an army of white ceramic bottles, a hefty pumpkin, a 
lone jar of anchovies. On the other side of the room, 
Morsy is bent over the kitchen counter. He is a flurry of 
motion, whirling from stove to sink to fridge, and then 
utterly still, garnishing a row of twelve identical soups. 
He does not look up as the magic show continues, 
but silently concentrates on the work before him. He 
has an intense air—eyes framed by round tortoise-shell 
glasses, a dark beard and moustache, hair pulled back 
into a tight bun—and an obsessive zeal about his work 
at The Sticker Shop. “If I fuck up a dish on Friday, all 
Saturday I’m redoing that dish,” he says. “I’ve pulled 
all-nighters cooking during exam period.” 

He talks about his work at The Sticker Shop with 
gravitas. “We’re challenging the conventions of a din-
ner,” he announces as he welcomes guests. He describes 
The Sticker Shop with the language of a self-fashioned 
foodie out to make a mark: “collective artistry,” “radical 
localism,” and the creation of “memorable experiences 
of the highest standard.” The endeavor is all Morsy does 
outside of classes. “Not just a project,” he declares, but 
the thing to which he wants to commit his life.

I first heard of Morsy via a friend who raved about 
a dinner “an upperclassman” had prepared on a 
weekend retreat for the Urban Improvement Corps—
another of Morsy’s extravagant meals. For the next few 
weeks, I heard bits and pieces about a mysterious Yalie 
who made restaurant-quality dinners at an off-campus 
apartment. Eventually I tracked him down, and at his 
request we met at Blue State late one night. I circled 
the place a few times before a man who had been 
sitting near the door pulled off the hood of his Baja 
hoodie and I realized it was Morsy. 

Morsy studies cognitive science at Yale but has been 
cooking seriously since he was a teenager. Originally 
from Alexandria, Egypt, he has worked at an array 
of restaurants, most recently at an izakaya in Japan. 
During a gap year before college, he struck an unusual 
deal with families in over fifty homes around the world 
using the travel site Couchsurfing: if they let him stay 
for a few nights, he would make them an extraordinary 
meal. Working with whatever appliances and resources 
were available, he “adapted very quickly to constraint.”

At The Sticker Shop, he has “two working burners, 
not even a standard-size sink, [and] a half-size fridge,” 
but also his magician’s flair for making “something out 
of nothing.” The limited set enhances the drama of his 
dinner-as-performance.  

The first course arrives: a covered white ceramic pot 
beside a hunk of homemade baguette on a wooden 
platter. I open the lid to find a roasted pepper soup. 
We all suspend conversation as we dip our bread. The 
soup appears simple, but Morsy reveals that it’s made 
from thirteen vegetables, including a ghost pepper. 
The soup is smooth and sweet until I taste its powerful 
spicy kick and have to rip off another piece of bread.

Out comes the second course: soy-braised pork belly 
with a caramel-miso-cinnamon glaze, served with 
a pickled vegetable and pear slaw and paired with a 
Goose Island wheat ale.

As we dig into the tender pork, happy groans echo 
around the table. “Every meal after this is not going 
to be the same!” someone laments. Morsy glances up 
from the kitchen and grins, filling fluted glasses with 
mango lassi provided by The Lassi Bar, a Yale startup.

Morsy ferries out the third course: long black 
boards with truffle arancini (risotto balls) served on a 
smear of spinach puree. By the time the next course 
arrives—dry-aged rib-eye with a red wine and raspberry 
reduction sauce—it seems impossible to eat more.  
But we do.

As the hours pass, our conversations grow louder and 
more animated and the votive candles go out one by 
one. In a dark corner of the kitchen, Morsy sweeps a 
blowtorch over a row of glass jars, toasting marshmal-
lows for desert. Four hours into the dinner, his concen-
tration is as intense as ever. Though working only a few 
feet from the table, he exists in another world.

For the final course, we are served “Dirt” in glass 
jars: a rum- and coffee-based chocolate mousse, topped 
with salty, hot figs and a homemade marshmallow 
infused with white chocolate liqueur and chestnuts.

Around midnight, the dinner winds to a close. Morsy 
is weary but radiant. “If you Google ‘runner,’ the third 
suggestion is ‘runner’s high,’” he says. “If you type in 
‘chef,’ there’s no ‘chef’s high.’ But I run, and I know the 
chef’s high is so real.” The fervor is a little much, but 
his pride is genuine. 

The Sticker Shop flips the dynamic of an ordinary 
restaurant, in which servers bring out dishes to patrons 
who will never meet the chef, never witness the sweat 
and imagination behind the meal. Here, Morsy is the 
star, and even when he’s quietly removed from his 
audience, it’s impossible to forget this. “How do you 
know Abdel?” people ask as their plates are cleared 
each round.
