Marx, a lawyer with New Haven Legal Assistance, 
represents the people who lived there. Del Hoyo, 
DeJesus, Rivera, their children, and more than fifty 
other families at Church Street South who were 
displaced due to black mold, decaying ceilings, 
crumbling staircases, and illnesses, among countless 
other issues. New Haven’s Livable City Initiative 
declared their units unlivable last September, and 
occupants moved into hotels around the city. Over the 
past few years, Northland Investment Corporation, 
the Boston-based company that owns the complex, 
has been the target of myriad accusations of neglect 
because of the Church Street South conditions. 
Northland is now at the center of legal action involving 
more than a thousand tenants. Over two hundred 
families remain in the apartments, waiting to hear 
where they will go. Their homes haven’t yet been 
condemned, but they know that the buildings will soon 
be torn down.

When the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development (HUD) assessed the property in response 
to the September inspections and other complaints, it 
came back with a score of 20 out of 100, the lowest given 
to any complex in New Haven’s history. The former 
residents are asking who is to blame. The previous 
year, HUD’s partial assessment was a positive eighty-
one percent, calling into question how much attention 
the department really pays to low-income properties. 
With the help of the Housing Authority of New Haven 
(HANH), Northland has begun to relocate families in 
the most severe conditions, but the process of finding 
new, affordable housing is sluggish at best and torturous 
for many. It’s a project that requires government 
inspections, landlords who will accept subsidized rent 
for short periods of time, and vacant, affordable homes. 
At the time of this publication, only forty-two families 
had managed to sign leases and relocate—only about 
fifteen percent of the residents at Church Street South. 
Representatives from Northland declined to comment 
for this article. 

Marx and another local attorney, David Rosen, 
separately represent the tenants against Northland, but 
while the private sector wrestles with accountability, 
families live in uncertainty. Seventeen families—left 
without homes in Church Street South or elsewhere—
are still staying in hotels. Some have gone to the 
Clarion, six miles north from where Marx stood; others 
have ended up in the Premiere, one mile past the 
train tracks. They have been there for months. Their 
belongings are often in storage if not destroyed by mold, 
and even large families are crammed into rooms with 
two beds. This is the aftermath of neglect. 

Clarion Hotel, Hamden, Connecticut
I had to enter the Clarion through the side entrance 
to meet Del Hoyo in her room. Plywood panels covered 
the main doors and windows of the lobby, and the front 
desk had been moved into the continental breakfast 
area, across from the cereal dispensers. The Sunday 
before, at 3 a.m., Del Hoyo woke up thinking a bomb 
had gone off. After the explosion, she scrambled out of 
bed with Jeilyn, her 1-year-old daughter, to get dressed, 
in case she had to run through the shards of glass that 
covered the hallways.

When she stepped outside, she realized that the 
bomb was, in fact, a silver sedan that had careened 
through the lobby’s wall. In a video she took of the 
scene, a doorframe torn off its hinges lies on the floor, 
chunks of glass litter the carpets, and police lights blink 
through gauzy curtains from the parking lot outside. In 
the center of the frame, the car’s pixilated back bumper 
sticks out of a pile of rubble that, minutes before, had 
been the reception desk. 

This incident didn’t faze Del Hoyo. Taking a record 
of her surroundings is routine by now, after snapping 
endless pictures of black mold and waterlogged 
windowsills from Church Street South. Compared to 
the gradual decay of her home, the car incident was 
minor—and ended quickly. 

When I knock on her first-floor door, she welcomes 
me in as if I were coming over for dinner. But there is 
no place for Del Hoyo to serve dinner, let alone cook, 
in her room. Northland gives her a weekly allowance 
for food. Her amenities add up to one queen-sized bed, 
a flat screen TV, and a bathroom. Laundry lies in piles 
near the door, and her daughter’s shoes (a pink boot, a 
sparkly sneaker) are scattered across the carpet. 

“There’s nothing to do here,” she says as she takes a 
seat on the bed, allowing me the only chair in the room. 
She’s been going to her mother’s and grandmother’s 
houses to avoid the hotel. “I literally have been going 
to work even on days that I don’t work, even on days 
when the office is closed.” She is still dressed in the 
scrubs she wears to her receptionist job at a health care 
clinic. Jeilyn crawls across the bed’s surface, back and 
forth, over and over, her small hands leaving slight 
impressions in the sheets. 

Because of the mold that climbed up the walls of 
Church Street South, Jeilyn now has three inhalers. 
Like many other children who grew up in the complex, 
she visits the doctor frequently. Del Hoyo seems 
exhausted when describing her apartment falling to 
pieces. There’s no mold at the Clarion or the other 
hotels where tenants are staying, but their sterile 
anonymity is hard to adjust to.

THE  NEW  JOURNAL
Across the hotel, on the second floor, Luz DeJesus 
is cooking rice in a Crock-Pot that teeters on the edge 
of a countertop barely big enough for the small sink. 
Her short frame is cramped while standing in front of 
it to stir. The food—held in rubber bins and cardboard 
boxes stacked on top of one another—leans against 
the wall behind her. She offers me a glass of water 
and free reign of the room’s mauve striped couch, 
but she’s offering me access not to her home, but to a  
temporary space. 

In September, both Del Hoyo and DeJesus moved 
out of Church Street South and into the Premiere 
Hotel, where they had stoves and a bit more space 
than they do now. The Premiere was close to their 
old apartments and the kids’ schools. But when Yale 
parents arrived for the University’s Family Weekend, 
DeJesus, Del Hoyo, and others had to move out. They 
were sent to the Clarion, on the other side of town, to 
make room for the visitors, a transfer coordinated by the 
Premiere. Larry Gottesdiener, the CEO of Northland, 
told the New Haven Independent that the incident was 
“unavoidable” and that “most or all” of the tenants 
would be moved back to the Premiere within days. The 
promise hasn’t held for DeJesus or Del Hoyo. 

DeJesus had lived at Church Street South’s José 
Martí Court building since 1996. She’s no stranger to 
the neglect from Church Street South administrators, 
which, she says, forced her family to be its own 
maintenance staff—it took building custodians two days 
to respond to her clogged sink, so her 17-year-old son 
Ramon bought supplies and did it himself. 

“We knew we had mold in the bathroom,” she says. 
“But nobody really knew the condition we were living 
in.” DeJesus stresses how impossible it was to get help 
from the complex’s maintenance. If she called about 
the mold, they often told her they didn’t have the 
supplies or time. If they did come, they strolled in days 
after the complaint and did a flimsy patchwork job. 

The environment became harder to bear as time 
went on. Her eyes and nose watered. The lupus she was 
diagnosed with in 2006 began acting up, and her whole 
family contracted asthma, a common symptom of living 
in the condemned apartments. “We’re all human just 
like they were,” she says of the Church Street South 
staff and executives. “But we were all living there 
basically, as I see it, as animals.” 

As the mold pushed her out of her apartment, the 
violence and drug use in the Church Street South 
courtyards pushed her back in. The complex takes 
up three blocks with no through streets; areas hidden 
behind concrete walls make it easier to commit crimes. 
DeJesus says gunshots kept her awake at night. “I never 
used to come out of the house,” she remembers. “If I sat 
out front, it was for a little bit so my kids could get air, 
and then we’d come back inside.”

DeJesus’s case first gained momentum after Del 
Hoyo introduced her to Marx. In February 2015, Del 
Hoyo got the ball rolling by calling the Livable City 
Luz and Ramon DeJesus with their parrot Pistachio.
