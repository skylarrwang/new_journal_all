Tony Sudol surveys his territory from the projection 
booth. He makes a brief foray into the theater to check 
light and sound levels, then returns satisfied. The show 
tonight, Jean-Luc Godard’s 1961 French New Wave film 
Breathless, is one Sudol has projected dozens of times. He 
knows exactly how it’s supposed to look and sound. While 
the first reel unspools in one of the reel-to-reel projection 
towers, Sudol runs his finger over the next, which he’ll 
load into the second tower in twenty minutes. He starts to 
thread the polyester film through the projector sprockets, 
saying he could do this in his sleep.

Inside the booth, the film sounds like a distant 
jackhammer as it rattles through the gears. We sit in silence 
and watch the characters’ drowned-out flirtations, waiting 
for the flashing black dot at the top right of the screen that 
will cue Sudol to change projectors. Sudol sings along 
with the movie’s four-note theme, the only sound from 
the theater that we manage to hear. I ask him if he likes 
Breathless. He pauses. “I do, but it isn’t successful because 
Jean-Luc Godard directed it,” he says. “It’s good because 
Jean-Pierre Melville, the great French director, suggested 
that he cut out all the unnecessary stuff. So he made this 
jump-cut storyline that was completely new at the time. I 
don’t like Godard.”


Sudol is Yale’s projectionist extraordinaire. A middle-
aged man with a balding ring of brown hair and nearly 
translucent blue eyes, he wears about twenty keys on his 
belt for all the rooms he has to access. He has worked 
at the Film Studies Center since 1997. He organizes 
speakers, rents prints, and—most importantly—projects 
movies nearly every day of the school year. He’s master 
of a profession that has very recently turned obsolete. In 
2000, there were thirty commercial digital screens in the 
world. By 2010, thirty percent of all theaters had gone 
digital, and by 2015, nearly every theater in the world had. 
The Whitney Humanities and Loria Centers are now 
the only venues in New Haven that still project film, and 
Sudol the shadowy figure in the back of the theaters who 
keeps the wheel moving.

He is a film buff with a projectionist’s eye; he can 
not only rank every film Scorsese ever made and rattle 
off all the relevant Bollywood flicks of the 2000s, but 
he also knows what kind of film they were shot on, 
what their appropriate color contrasts are, which high-
quality film prints do them justice and which digitized 
versions render them flat and lifeless. He much prefers 
film to digital, mostly because it gives him control over 
the screening—the power, as he puts it, “to see that the 
director’s vision for the film is rightfully displayed.” While 
modern projectionists download a movie and press play, 
Sudol controls everything about a reel-to-reel screening, 
including the light, sound, projection speed, and aspect 
ratio (the relationship between the image’s width and 
height). He knows, for example, that badly digitized 
versions of silents often use the wrong speed, chopping 
off the sides of the image or speeding up frames so the 
characters zip around like wind-up dolls. This drives 
Sudol mad. He notices everything. Once, watching a 
1960s film he’d seen before, certain that the focus on the 
projector was correct, he noticed that the credits on the 
print itself were out of focus. 

Projection itself isn’t an art form; Sudol considers it 
“protecting someone’s art form.” While he has no control 
over the quality of a print, he can certainly project it 
badly. If he screws up, the effect is like a handsome dog in 
terrible makeup. Charlie Chaplin can run too fast or the 
mysterious four-note theme in Breathless can shriek over 
Patricia Franchini’s disaffected musings on love. If you see 
a film at Yale, Sudol is probably there. If he does his job 
right, you won’t know it.

Sudol once wanted to be a filmmaker. He tried to make 
movies out of college in the eighties, went into debt, got 
a day job at a phone company, and started working as a 
part-time projectionist in 1988. He was a programming 
director for nine years at the New Haven International 
Film Festival, and has worked at Yale since 1997, full-time 
since 2010. The job is technical, but Sudol obsesses over 
film from all angles. 

As many films as he has seen and projects in a given week, 
as hyper-aware as he is of their presentation, his reason for 
watching movies is rather ordinary: to be immersed in a 
story. He hates films with hackneyed narratives that aim to 
score style points or box-office success, but he still believes 
in substance over style. “Story—and the telling of it—is 
the most important part of a film,” he says.

On this point, Sudol has a long-running disagreement 
with Ron Gregg, a film professor and programming 
director of the Whitney Humanities Center. Gregg, who 
teaches Postwar Queer Avant-Garde Film in the fall and 
Hollywood in the 21st Century in the spring, doesn’t even 
pay attention to movie narratives anymore. “Film follows 
a formula,” Gregg says. “I’m rarely lost in film because 
I can tell you within the first five minutes what’s going 
to happen.” Somehow this realization hasn’t made him 
jaded. “So why do I still go see movies? Why did I see 
Mad Max: Fury Road? I know that Mad Max is going to 
win. It doesn’t matter—the experience of the story is the 
aesthetics of it: the costumes, the acting, the editing. The 
story was fine but the aesthetics were amazing. Amazing!”

Sudol and Gregg argue all the time. One of Gregg’s 
favorite movies of this millennium is the Wachowski’s 
2008 remake of Speed Racer. “That movie is pure eye 
candy,” he says. “It’s like watching a moving painting. It’s 
the most expensive art film I’ve ever seen.”

“I hate that movie,” Sudol told me. “There’s no story 
there. It’s unbearable.”     	

Sudol’s favorite films play with Hollywood formula. His 
first cinematic love was Sam Peckinpah’s 1969 Western, 
The Wild Bunch. “What Peckinpah did in that movie was 
take the rules of a Western and flip them on their heads—
he started where all other Westerns end and made the 
good guys the bad guys.” Sudol seems to set up rules for 
what he likes so that they can be inverted. “I like movies 
to have beautiful sets, but Lars von Trier didn’t do that in 
Dogville,” he says. “That movie didn’t have a set; it broke 
all the rules for me. But I was sitting on the edge of my seat 
by the end of it, thinking, ‘Lars, don’t fail me, don’t fail 
me.’ And he didn’t! I was so immersed that I wasn’t even 
paying attention to what I usually look for.”

Sudol gets excited when films manipulate their 
audiences—not emotionally (“I can’t stand it when movies 
pull at my heartstrings,” he says), but physically, when they 
trick viewers into thinking they’re actually in the movie. In 
one scene in Polanski’s Rosemary’s Baby, for example, the 
characters are talking in a room and the camera is placed 
right behind the doorframe. In a theater, Sudol says, you’ll 
see people craning their necks, trying to see beyond the 
door. It’s a clever aesthetic trick in a movie with a famous 
narrative—though whether the shot is engrossing because 
of the devil baby story or the devil baby story is engrossing 
because of the shot is up for debate.

Sudol acknowledges that not all viewers notice, or care 
about, the details he obsesses over. He’s so attuned to 
editing, acting, lighting, and film quality that when he’s 
jolted out of a viewing experience, he knows exactly why. 
He doesn’t like talking about the mechanics of filmmaking 
because it makes him too self-conscious. “If you’re pulled 
out of a film and you know that a jump cut irritated you, 
it ruins the illusion,” he says. But in order for the illusion 
to be successful, the film has to be screened correctly. He 
wanted to see Once Upon a Time in the West since he was 
a teenager, but he refused to rent a corrupt digital copy. 
Instead, he waited twenty-five years until the movie was 
playing at a nearby theater so he could see it on film.  

If the students watching Breathless for class examine 
the film as an image, Sudol examines it as an object. 
Debating aesthetics versus narrative means nothing to a 
projectionist without considering how the film is actually 
shown—on an original print, on a crappy re-print, on 
Blu-Ray, streamed online. In Sudol’s opinion, every 
technological change in the way a movie is shown affects 
the quality of the illusion. This makes him understandably 
anxious these days. Film technology has never been so in 
flux as it is now. 

The argument that pits analog purists against digital 
progressives is often boiled down to sentimentality versus 
practicality (“Film looks better!” cry the purists; “Digital is 
the future!” reply the progressives), but neither medium is 
objectively superior, aesthetically or practically. 
Film doesn’t always look better than digital. 

Appreciators laud film’s chemical advantage, which 
provides sharper, more vibrant pictures than cookie 
cutter pixels. While it’s true that digital pixels haven’t yet 
achieved the chemical precision of film, the gap is closing 
quickly. “I was watching a Blu-Ray copy of Citizen Kane 
the other day and it looked pretty damn good,” Gregg tells 
me. “Certainly the average viewer couldn’t have told the 
difference from a film print.” Moreover, the actual quality 
of a film image depends on the quality of the print, which 
varies wildly. Old prints are often scratched and spotted; 
most prints from the sixties and seventies were shot on 
cheap film that has since turned pink.

Humans have always disrespected film, even when it 
was the dominant movie-making technology. Sudol calls 
it the “abused art form.” Ninety percent of American silent 
films are lost for good, because American film studios 
destroyed the prints after sound emerged in the 1930s. 
The studios didn’t want to pay to store the unpopular 
silents. TV stations would simply wipe the film used for 
newsreels and sitcoms and reuse the base. And there’s 
the millions of small-scale abuses: cheap theaters that 
kept their light bulbs until they burned out, ushers who 
threaded platter reels so that the gears scratched the prints 
diagonally, student projectionists who fell asleep while the 
reel jammed and the bulb burned a hole in the frame.

Unlike data, film decays. How it decays depends 
on when it was made: films before 1954 were all shot 
on a highly flammable nitrate base, which can auto-
ignite (as happened in 1978, when the nitrate vaults of 
both the United States National Archives and Records 
Administration and the George Eastman House burned 
to the ground and their rare contents were lost forever) or 
decay into goo, dust, and a no-less flammable gas. Between 
1954 and the early nineties the base switched to acetate, 
which degrades into acetic acid. Any archivists can tell 
that a film has died the second they open its canister and 
smell vinegar. Now film is made of polyester, a strong, 
pliable, durable plastic ideal for prints. But the material is 
too strong for cameras, which will break if the film jams. 
While film doesn’t last forever, digital isn’t necessarily 
more stable. “Someone can find a film that’s been in a 
hut in a jungle for seventy years and it still holds up,” says 
Brian Meacham, an archivist at the Yale Film Studies 
Center, “whereas the digital footage you shot yesterday 
could be inexplicably corrupted.” Film can last for over 
one hundred years if preserved correctly, at a relatively low 
cost for the archivist. Digital archives cost twelve times as 
much per film to maintain, and are under constant threat 
of data extinction, tech obsolescence, and degradation. If 
a studio runs out of money, you won’t find the digital data 
miraculously preserved in a jungle. 

Film lovers like Sudol and Meacham like to honor 
a film by showing it in its original state. But every film 
is a physical product of its era, altered as technology 
changes. The nitrate films of the Twenties were projected 
onto screens made with actual silver, to dazzling three-
dimensional effect. Some Blu-Ray recordings remove the 
hisses and scratches from old prints and enhance their 
fading colors; others compress the print into a dull plane. 
Some digital films turn black backgrounds grey and 
wobbly; others offer special effects so convincing that they 
swirl out of every shot like a moving painting. Directors 
like the Wachowskis dive triumphantly into digital cinema, 
while Quentin Tarantino outfitted theaters worldwide 
with old projection equipment this past year, so that he 
could show The Hateful Eight in seventy-millimeter film. 
Maybe digital archives will fail and prove the purists right. 
Maybe digital will advance so far that even Sudol can’t 
tell the difference between a pixel and a molecule. For 
now every film exists in suspended copies of itself, some 
in binary and some in celluloid, each distinct difference 
altering the film’s experience for the sharp-eyed viewer. 

So we have people like Sudol, in a relic profession, 
projecting our film experiences like Oz behind the curtain. 
You come for a pleasant experience and he generates your 
illusion, knowing, through obsession, what you don’t—
that the illusion may auto-ignite in a warehouse or be 
deleted when a studio runs out of money, that the jump 
cut wasn’t Godard’s idea, that the Blu-Ray copy corrupted 
the colors, that Polanski put the camera by the door so 
you’d try and see beyond it, that this is a good story because 
it turns the Western trope inside out, that this is a piece of 
crap because the story is just a chase scene, that you may 
never see a movie as dazzling as Citizen Kane on nitrate, 
that the credits are out of focus on this print.
