MANAGEMENT IN A MASON JAR

Yale SOM is investing in applesauce
Amelia Nierenberg
The first time I met Catherine Wu, she sat with 
two small, misshapen apples at the Happiness Lab, 
a coffee shop on Chapel Street. Beside her were also 
three tiny mason jars, each with a different flavor of 
UglyFruit, the “artisanal applesauce” Wu makes from 
Connecticut apples and sells to local coffee shop(pe)
s. I had just taken a bite of the “vanilla bourbon” flavor 
(savory, spicy, an applesauce iteration of how houses 
smell after wood fires), when she leaned across to ask 
what I thought. “It’s good,” I said, surprised at her 
intensity. She nodded knowingly. “But how good?” 
she probed, her quiet voice clipped and professional. 
“What does it make you think about?”

The 
name 
“UglyFruit” 
doesn’t 
make 
sense 
immediately. The finished product is far from ugly. The 
mason jars (which you can bring back to the Happiness 
Lab for a discount on your next purchase) are, frankly, 
adorable. But the apples Wu uses are ugly, which is why 
farmers couldn’t profit from selling them in grocery 
stores. Thousands of pounds of apples rot in orchards 
across Connecticut every harvest season because they’re 
too unsightly for consumers. Wu has managed to turn 
this excess into a resource, fodder for a business idea. She 
conceived the idea of targeting food waste after watching 
a John Oliver segment on America’s wasted produce. 

In her snug green sweater and delicate gold jewelry, it’s 
hard to imagine Wu—Cat to her friends—going apple 
picking. Wu doesn’t even like regular applesauce. She has 
a “super strong gag reflex” for the stuff (though she does 
love apple pie). So she made applesauce that she could 
actually eat: no mealy texture, no added sugars.

She fancies herself the Johnny Appleseed of New 
Haven, but has little previous experience in agriculture. 
Before she enrolled in the Yale School of Management, 
she graduated from Wellesley with a double major in 
Economics and Political Science, then worked as a 
consulting analyst and for education non-profits.

She’s successfully made applesauce, a staple of lunch 
boxes and old age homes, pretty hip. “It’s weird,” she 
said. “I’m known as the applesauce lady at SOM.” With 
a grant and mentorship from the Venture Creation 
Program at SOM, Wu has thrown herself into mission-
driven business, seeking to profit and also do social 
good. She views UglyFruit as a “lifestyle brand”: its 
customers hypothetically live ethical, healthy, and 
socially minded lives, so they gravitate towards a snack 
that satisfies both their values and their appetites. 

At least, that’s the marketing strategy. It works for 
loyal customer and equally idealistic SOM student 
Hannah Grill ’17: “This goes beyond turning apples 
into applesauce—this is about connecting people to 
the food they eat in a new way.” Through limited trials, 
Wu has sold over one hundred jars and has over eighty 
customers with direct delivery pre-orders. She plans to 
have product in mainstream grocery stores sometime  
this spring. 

When Wu talks about potential flavor experiments 
(“There’s so much you can do with apples”), UglyFruit 
seems less like a solution to a dire problem and more 
like an entrée to entrepreneurship. For all its novelty, 
UglyFruit is the outcome of the standard MBA mindset—
find a hole in the market, make a business idea around 
it, and launch your product. Many of the other start-ups 
out of the SOM Venture Creation Program also employ 
this doing-good-by-doing-well business model: Braingrove 
provides a social learning platform, Sustainable Luxury 
Pearl creates luxury jewelry by restoring the natural 
pearl farming environment in China, and Maike 
Water reduces the brine discharge related to seawater 
desalination technologies. 

UglyFruit is not yet at the core, pun intended, of the 
SOM social enterprise start-up scene, but Wu is already 
testing new flavors. Next up in applesauce: vanilla earl 
grey. It’s not on the market yet, but Wu describes it as an 
“Asian-Japanese taste of more floral flavors,” and she’s 
catering to a female demographic. It’s the taste of next 
week’s success—light, sweet, and just a little zany.
