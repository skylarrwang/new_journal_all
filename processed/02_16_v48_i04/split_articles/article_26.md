Navigating the limits of the University’s support

Elise* ’16 speaks the way most people write—with-
out garden-path syntax, unnecessary repetition, or filler 
words. Her tone is even and detached, simultaneously 
emphatic and matter-of-fact. Her lack of facial and audi-
tory expressiveness is common in autistic people and bril-
liant but abrasive television detectives—but then, I knew 
what to look for. We didn’t make eye contact. 
Like many women with autism, Elise received her 
diagnosis relatively late in life. She was frank about 
the process. “It sucked. I always knew something was 
wrong, or off, and I just thought I was crazy.” This was 
the first of several points in our interview where I was 
forced to suppress a powerful urge to babble in sympa-
thy. My own emotional memory ranges from patchy to 
nonexistent, but I’ve never had any trouble recalling 
the way I felt the first time I read the words “Asperg-
er’s Syndrome”: recognition, followed by manic,  
soaring relief.
One of the more prevalent clichés in the autistic 
community is that if you’ve met one autistic person, 
you’ve met one autistic person—a counter to the com-
mon misconception that our personalities, opinions, 
symptoms, and capabilities proceed uniformly from 
our diagnosis. If anything, our shared experience is the 
experience of being different. (It’s worth noting that 
my experience is necessarily and drastically limited to 
those of us with the cognitive and motor skills neces-
sary for mainstream education. Self-awareness requires 
some liminal relationship with normality.) We grow up 
with bizarre talents and unexplained skill gaps, intel-
ligent and incapable and out-of-place. Fear, guilt, and 
self-doubt are as close to universal as anything I’ve  
ever encountered. 
But we are often met with the polite conviction that 
people like us don’t exist. Yet even among medical pro-
fessionals, there is a tendency to assume certain attri-
butes are incompatible with an autism diagnosis. 
Elise started looking for explanations midway 
through her sophomore year. “The doctor I saw said, 
‘Nope, nothing wrong.’ I wasn’t satisfied with that, and 
I wanted a second opinion.” She seemed to be in a 
good place to get one: with Yale’s Child Studies Cen-
ter, New Haven is a strong contender for the autism 
research capital of the United States. But that’s not to 
say that Yale-affiliated psychologists are, broadly speak-
ing, equipped to handle the fact that autistic children 
grow up to be autistic adults. Most doctors wouldn’t 
even agree to see her. She was too old, too female, and 
too competent. “One of the reasons for why I couldn’t 
be autistic was ‘Oh, but you got into Yale,’” Elise told 
me. Cue sympathy-babble. No one at Yale has reacted 
to my diagnosis with cruelty, hostility, or even ill intent, 
but I’d heard the same thing before.
There is no one autistic story. There is no one 
“attending Yale while autistic” story, and I haven’t tried 
to write it. According to the Resource Office on Dis-
abilities, there are at least eleven. That’s how many 
Yale students have registered for academic or housing 
accommodations. Judy York, the office’s director, told 
me that the actual number is almost certainly higher. 
I’ve spoken to three. Two more declined to be inter-
viewed. With such a small sample size, I can’t claim 
to be dispelling stereotypes about a marginalized, if 
miniscule, group. This is a call to accuracy, not action. 
I owe my friendship with Joshua* ’15 to unvarnished 
anthropological self-interest. I’d been at Yale for about 
three months and had settled into a socially anxious 
orbit around other Directed Studies students. He was a 
chronically introverted physics major. I hadn’t yet met 
another autistic person at Yale. At that point in my life 
I’d met exactly two, total. Everything I knew about the 
inside view came from blogs, magazine articles, and
