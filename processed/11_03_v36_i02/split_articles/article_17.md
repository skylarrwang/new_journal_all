ROM THE ROAD THAT WINDS OUT OF THE TOWN of Guilford and 
down into the valley, the lake seemed to be at peace in its bed. A 
red blanket of hemlocks and oaks had folded over the hills and 
Lake Quonnipaug lay still and flat. Past the bend in the road, in the 
center of the III -acre stretch of water, a fisherman wrapped in his over-
coat had slowed his boat to a stop and dropped anchor. As he cast his 
line and watched it sink that October morning, he might have thought 
that all was well in the waters below. 
· 
What the fisherman may have not known was that the sleepy 
waters were under siege. In the dark ledges of the lake, two weeds born 
in distant waters had wheedled their way into the soil-bed, made them-
selves at home, and slowly begun to choke the lake. No one, not the 
town residents who spend so many hours on the water, nor the expert 
researchers who investigate the spread of the invasion, knows whether 
the lake will ever return to what it once was. But they're willing to give 
it a try 
even if it means fighting a battle that may already be lost. 


HE WEEDS WERE FIRST SPOTTED over four years ago, lurking 
around the boat launch in the northern cove. It was here that 
Ben Sylvester, the long-standing secretary of the Friends of 
Quonnipaug and the man who first saw the odd-looking plant waving 
its spindly green fmgers and perking up its pearly white head. Having 
spent almost every day of the past four decades out on the lake, he 
knew something new and alien had taken root. 

Sylvester had already lost one lake to the weeds and he wasn't 
about to lose another. Back in 1963, as director of rowing at the Choate 
School, Mr. Sylvester had to tell the Wild Boars boys' team that they 
could no longer row in Community Lake in Wallingford, where they 
had practiced for almost to 50 years. The weeds had grown up to the 
surface and closed off the lake. 

Forced out by the weeds, the team moved to the boat launch in the 
north end of Lake Quonnipaug. Except for the lily-pads in the south-
channel, the lake was in pretty good shape. It was here that Sylvester, 
an experienced single sculler, coached his team to many national cham-
pionships: As a ·continuous presence on Lake Quonnipaug, he has 
come to know the ways of the lake better than most people. 

Sylvester arid other residents began to worry about their lake. They 
first saw the strange plant along the boat· cove, cropping up near the 
beach and skulking into the shallow ledges in the heart of the lake. 
Though the town had been dealing with an overgrowth of pondweed 
and lily-pads for several years, no one living by the water had ever seen 
the likes of these massive roots. 

Fearful that the strange plant might put an end to summer boat-
ing, decimate property values and take hold of the entire lake, Sylvester 
and a small group of Guilford residents began to pressure the town 
experts to do something about the invading alien species. When the 
chairman of the Milford Conservation Community called to order the 
spring meeting three years ago, the first order of business was to devise 
a plan of action for the lake. They decided to call in the experts. 

The two alien weeds identified in the lake are formally known as 
Cabomba caroliniana and Eurasian water milfoil. Each is a noxious 
. 
non-native species, and, if released in the right conditions, it has the 
potential to choke out native plants, birds, fish, and reptiles. The 
plants, popular aquarium decorations, travelled a long way before 
reaching Connecticut. Researchers believe that Eurasian milfoil may 
have slipped from a lake somewhere in Europe or North Africa onto 
the underside of a commercial freight and traveled into the Chesapeake 
Bay as early as the r88os. Cabomba probably traveled a shorter distance 
to Lake Quonnipaug 
perhaps tucked in a shipping crate from its 
native lakes in the southern United States to an aquarium store some-
where on the Atlantic seaboard, then moving to the gravelly base of a 
fish-tank in a child's room, only to be poured into a backyard creek, 
where the weed was free to run rampant. 

By the mid I990s, weed sightings by Connecticut lake managers 
and residents had become commonplace.. Seeds were hitdiing rides on 
boat motors to new lakes, and flying on the beaks of birds scanning the 
waters for food, before finding new territory and laying root to blos-
som.

However the weeds entered Connecticut, the scientific communi-
ty agrees that these non-native species pose a very real threat to lake 
ecology. A report published last July by the State Council on 
Environment Quality names non-native plants and animals as the sec-
ond greatest threat to Connecticut's natural habitats after land devel-
opment. The Union of Concerned Scientists has estimated that non-
native species are responsible for at least half of the threatened species 
in this country. Weeds like Cabomba and Eurasian milfoil are particu-
larly troubling because they have the potential to wipe out entire native 
species, fostering a monoculture that would destroy the delicate balance 
of the ecosystem. 

Confronted with this growing body of evidence both national and 
state legislators have taken several initiatives to control and curb the 
spread of non-native plants. In February of 1999, President Clinton 
formed the National Invasive Species Council to investigate ways to 
halt the spread of these species, which annually cost the country 
approximately $137 billion, while aquatic needs cost $275 million. 
Earlier this year, Congress passed a landmark piece of legislation, the 
National Aquatic Invasive Species Act, which alocated $170 million for 
"

prevention, contro , an researc _ . 

Many lake communities welcome these efforts, bur legislativ~ 
debates on prevention methods and the imposition of restrictions on 
the sale of non-native species are of little use to residents like Ben 
Sylvester whose lakes have already been invaded by Cabomba and mil-
foil. For them, the overgrowth of weeds could transform their beloved 
lake to a murky marsh. The loss would be more than sentimental: 
. . 
Studies have shown that non-native weed overgrowth can lead to a 
drop of ro percent or more in land valu~. 

So while legislators and conservationists gather in closed rooms to 
. discuss various proposals for prevention, town residents have taken 
their own initiative. They want the weeds gone for good, but they are 
slowly discovering that weeds may be fiercer than suspected. 

NoVEMBER 2003 

RESIDENTS PHONED THE CoNNECTICUT Agricultural 
Experimental Station (cAEs) three years ago, there was no 
aquatic weed expert around to pick up. The scientists at 
CAES, a brick building pocketed-in New Haven's tree-lined Hutchinson 
· Street, were busy with other tasks: chasing an Asian beetle that was 
rapidly consuming New England's hemlocks, and researching the 
spread and containment of West Nile Disease. Given that non-native 
weeds had only recently begun appearing in Connecticut lakes, there 
did nor yet seem to be a need for an aquatic weed specialist. 

When Greg Bugbee, an expert responsible for the station's soil test-
ing laboratory, offered to look at the lake, he seemed as well equipped 
as anyone. A soil scientist with over twenty years experience at CAES, 
Bugbee had already tackled one weed problem in Bashan Lake in East 
Hamden, Connecticut the year before. Having grown up on lakes and 
studied their beds, Bugbee knew them to be a realm of ecological sci-
ence where there- were more questions than answers. 

After an initial survey of Quonnipaug Lake, Bugbee discovered 
that the lake's vegetation had undergone some very rapid changes, 
which was highly unusual considering the typically static nature of lake 
water chemistry. The CAES study confumed that extensive areas of 
Eurasian milfoil and Cabomba had cropped up in Lake Quonnipaug. 
At the time, affected areas were confined mostly to the boat launch 
cove and the beach area, but unless action was taken, these weeds could 
soon t~e over the whole lake. 

With the residents demanding action, and published evidence 
backing the residents' demands, the GCC realized it needed to find a 
solution quickly. In early summer of 2001, Guilford took its first stab 
at removing the weeds no other town in Connecticut had beaten. 
The town agreed to fund a team from CAES to investigate the effec-
tiveness of treating the non-native weeds with spot applications of her-
bicide. At the very least, the project would allow Bugbee to observe the 
weeds' response to herbicide. With any luck, the projectwould destroy 
the plants for good, preserving the lake's biodiversity and pacifying the 
rowers, fishermen, and home-owners.

The process of weed hunting quickly 
turned into a game of hide-and-go-seek. 
Over the following two summers, in accor-
dance with the research plan, a powerboat 
equipped with a spray can of granular fluri-
odone set out to test the toughness of 
Cabomba · and Eurasian milfoil. When the 
weeds were blasted with up to 150 pounds of 
herbicide per acre, they didn't last long. 
Within a matter of weeks, the green foliage 
had turned brown and limp. The shriveled 
remains floated to the_ surface, and no plants 
from the boat area alone were hauled away in 
trucks. 

In the weeks following the treatment, it 
looked as if the combination of herbicide and 
machinery had succeeded. Follow-up surveys 
after the treatments in 2002 confirmed that 
almost every last stem of Cabomba and 
Eurasian milfoil had died 
the boat launch 
cove and the beach were finally clear. When · 
the Commission convened last January, the 
final reports came in: residents were pleased 
with the hydro-raking. With a little bit of 
spray, a week of heavy mowing, and a lot of 
pressure from homeowners, the lake had been 
restored 
or so they thought. 

But the home-owners weren't 
completely satisfied. In the spring of 
2002, after the initial herbicide treat-
ments in the north, 369 Guilford res-
idents signed a petition demanding 
that the town clear out the lake's 
south end, where native lily-pads had 
clogged up the channel for years. 
Realizing the mobilized force of resi-
dents expected action, when the 
Commission gathered again for its 
regular town meeting in March, the 
Chairman proposed a last resort tech-
nique that had not yet been dis-
cussed: hydro-raking . . 
. The hydro-raking process is akin 
to lawn-mowing for lakes, and is · a 
fairly common method of weed con-
trol. In the past hydro-raking has 
proven to be a useful, if pricey, strate-
gy for removing vegetation. The lake 
residents and the GCC hoped that the 
machines would remove the last of 
the submerged vegetation, floating 
· debris, and clumps of soil. Acco1·ding to 
Aquatic Control Technologies, . the private 
hydro-raking 
company 
from 
Sutton, 
Massachusetts that agreed to take on the job, 
the mowing would pose little or no perma-
nent threat to the lake's sediment and soil 
structure, and the hefty fee they demanded 
would be worth the results. 

Even 
though 
the 
Connecticut 
Department of Environmental Protection 
had expressed concerns that the raking might 
cause more harm than good, the township 
pressed on. In October of 2002, a heavy-set 
man 
in 
a 
plaid shirt 
arrived 
. Massachusetts, switched on an enormous 
machine armed with giant teeth and a pow-
erful engine, and set to work. For one week, 
the rake dug deep into the lake-bed. A pro-
cession of dump trucks loaded with lake sed-
iment and vegetation wove its way to the 
town compost. 

RUISING PAST THE SOLE FISHERMAN 
out on the water on that day of 
October, Greg Bugbee adjusted his 
reflective sunglasses and headed straight for 
the south end. Bugbee had not been to the 
lake for over a. month, and this excursion 
might be his last chance this season to inves-
tigate the area. It had been a year since the 
hydro-rakers departed, but even before he 
reached the lake's southern tip, Bugbee knew 
that the weeds would still be there waiting for 
him. 

Sure enough, when Bugbee eased off the 
throttle and the boat entered the south chan-
nel, he saw that the seemingly peaceful lake 
was growing sick again. Entire patches of the 
lake bed-dark and deadened soil never 
intended to see the light of day 
had made 
their way up to the surface, forming islands. 
Scattered between these clumps of alien land, 
thick lily-pad roots torn from the sediment 
arced out of the water. 

As the boat slowed, Bugbee tipped up his 
Guilford baseball-cap, and leaned over the 
whalings to have a closer look. He peered 
through the aqua scope, a tube used for 
underwater observation. As bubbles ran 
under the circle of glass, a brilliant green ten-
dril waving in the current came into focus: 
Cabomba. The weed had slipped from the 
northern to the southern side without anyone 
noticing, and was now slowly weaving a thick 
green carpet across the entire channel. 

The weed had slipped from the 
northern to the southern side 
without anyone noticing and was 
now slowly weaving _a thick green 
carpet across the entire channel. 

Putting away the aqua scope, Bugbee 
stood and returned to the wheel. He did 
not look pleased. As he maneuvered the 
boat through the placid southern chan-
nel, Bugbee knew that the culprit respon-
sible for the murky islands and the 
uprooted mess of lilies were not the hated 
alien weed. This time around, the 
machines seemed the. root of the prob-
lem. When the heavy metal teeth gnawed 
up the lily pads last October, they dis-
lodged the soil bed, and in the wrecked, 
open space, Cabomba had dosed in. In 
fact, the blade spinning behind the 
machine may even have spit out 
Cabomba seed fragments leftover from 
other lake jobs. 

"It just dug up the whole bottom," 
Bugbee explained, nodding at the section 
of the lake that now resembled a marsh. 
Bugbee had supporters: both the town 
commissioners and the Friends of 
Quonnipaug recognized their blunder. 
As the chairman of the Gee William 
Johnson explained, "By disturbing the 
site we actually created conditions for inva-
sives to come in where they were not present 
before." Even Sylvester, who's still hoping he 
will have more luck with this lake than his last 
one, agrees the fight against weeds may have 
led to more problems than answers. 

EGATIVE SIDE-EFFECTS like those in 
the southern channel have prompt-
ed some environmentalists.to won-
der if it might be better to let the weeds run 
wild. According to Chuck Lee at the 
Connecticut DEP, there is always a chance 
that Mother Nature will sort things out at her 
own pace. Not only do mechanical control 
options like hydro-raking have the potential 
to destroy local habitats and even advance the 
spread of non-native species by transporting 
seed fragmentS from lake to lake, but herbici-
dal methods, if not properly administered,
