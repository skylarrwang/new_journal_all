WHEN I FIRST ENTERED THE BACKROOM of 
the Eli Whitney Museum, it felt more like the 
North 
Pole 
at 
Christmas time 
than 
Connecticut. The walls were lined with book-
shelves bearing toy soldiers and brightly 
painted wooden dolls. Giant model planes 
swung from the ceiling. I half-expected an elf 
to peep out from behind one of the piles of 
old-fashioned wooden board games on the 
counters. I was even greeted by a tall jolly 
man with white hair. Clearly, here was the 
master of this whimsical toyshop. 


But behind this child's paradise was not

Santa, but Bill Brown, the director of the Eli 
Whitney Museum. Unlike Santa, Brown ·· 
wears a prominent patch over his right eye, 
. and works in an office where employees' cos-
tumed dogs roam freely. Comfortable in an 
atmosphere as unorthodox as he is, Brown 
tends to the daily affairs of the museum and 
spins the history of one visionary to imple-
ment the ideas of another. 


Eli Whitney, Yale class of 1792, may have 
been one of America's most innovative inven-
tors, but his groundbreaking work was often 
used for sinister aims. Whitney designed 
guns, and most famously invented the cotton 
gin, the machine almost solely responsible for 
sustaining the institution of slavery in 
America. Despite Whitney's dubious legacy, 
Brown has found a way to promote his 
unique views on education by channeling 
Whitney's innate genius and passion as an 
inventor. ''I'm using Eli Whitney," Brown 
explains. "He did not read until he was 
twelve, he. was wonderful with his hands. His 
persona gave me an excuse to institute this 
kind of program which I am sure I would 
.. have just done somewhere else." 


· Brown's liberal view of Whitney has 
inspired a broad repertoire of classes for 
Connecticut kids. The museum organizes 
workshops ranging from a doll-making 
course for three, four, and five-year-olds, to 
instructions on building model airplanes and 
race cars for older students. He has developed 
an extensive selection of projects for 
preschoolers to high school students, all 
focusing on kinetic learning, a type of 
instruction not normally present in the class-
room. Brown, originally trained as a clinical 
sociologist, claims that "15-20 percent of the 
population is not suited for learning in the 
classroom." The museum advertises these 
projects as a "return to the basics." They are 
modeled after the type of experiments done 
by Da Vinci, Newton, the Wright Brothers, 
and, of course, Whitney. All focus on solving 
problems by working with your hands. 


Brown also attempts to incorporate his-
tory into his projects. In one course, students 
build toy soldiers, which they use to reenact 
wars. Recently, Brown worked with a school 
group to build and reenact Alexander the 
Great's campaign across Persia. "You might 
think it odd since I'm a Quaker that I would 
want to do projects reenacting war, but I have 
observed that if you learn the history of bat-
tles, you also learn how worthless they are and 
how much you don't want to have them," 
Brown said, extending this message into a 
warning: "Some modern leaders should real-


ize that nobody ever conquered Persia suc-
cessfully." Ironically, the very site where these 
pacifist lessons are now being taught was once 
the factory for Winchester Repeating Arms 
Company, the largest firearms manufacturer 
in the United States. 


Brown looks for students in these group 
activities that especially excel at hands-on 
projects. It is these children that are invited 
back to work for the museum as members of 
the apprenticeship program. The program 
employs up to 75 high school students who 
spend from 50 to 500 hours a year developing 
building challenges for younger students~ ·. 
helping to run the museum and working on 
inventions of their own. "I have learned that 
people who often struggle in the classroom 
paradoxically have the gift that makes them 
great car builders," Brown explained. Many 
of these apprentices have gone on to excel in 
the design field or in computers, and one 
even participates in model airplane competi-
tions on a national team. 


Besides helping students, . the school-
wide projects also give the museum workers 
an opportunity to observe students in a labo-
ratory-like setting. Bill Brown spends time 
observing the basic behavioral patterns of the 
students he teaches, and has developed a wide 
array of sociological theories. For example, 
one project asks a group of female elementary 
students to build a castle from materials of 
their choice. Brown has noticed that although 
girls often build a "womb structure," which is 
what psychologists predict, they also at times 
build a "phallic structure," a form more often 
chosen by boys. 


"These programs are for the people that 
don't necessarily go to school or finish col-
lege," Brown says. "It's hard to be the one 
who does the. exploring," he said, referring to 
dropouts. Brown claims that this is not only 
because families don't approve, but also 
because society itself, in its very nature, is 
against them. "It is much easier to go Yale, 
which makes your mother happy, as opposed 
to doing something else," Brown said 
brusquely. 


Although Bill Brown has a refreshingly 
non-academic vision of learning, it is also a 
romantic one. He seems to be using the lega-
cy of a man whose life was in many ways dia-
metrically· opposed to the values he is trying 
to teach the children who go through his 
museum. The museum's guidebook reports 
that the museum is contemplating changing 
its name to the Whitney Workshop. Perhaps 
it would be more accurate to drop Whitney 
from the title altogether.
