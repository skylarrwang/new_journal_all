N SEPTEMBER 26, 1998, 15-year-old Tabatha Brendle hung herself 
in her bedroom at the Long Lane School, a now defunct juvenile 
facility for violent teens in Middletown, Connecticut. Before her 
stay at. Long Lane, Brendle had endured years of physiCal and sexual 
abuse at home. The state was never able to intervene. Brendle's suicide 
revealed a disturbing trend: Unlike in the I960S and I970S., when most 
children in need of protective serVices were orphans or children of ter-
minally ill parents, today children like Breridle are more often victims 
of unspeakable acts of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. · 
Today, horror stories of children under state care appear in news- · 
papers all the time. The Connecticut system is no exception. In 
September 1994, a 19-month-old Waterbury girl named Tazjin Jones, 
whose family was under the watch of the Department of Children and 
Families (ocF), was beaten to death by her mother's boyfriend. On 
March 13, 1995, a 9-momh-old Emily Hernandez, died under similar 
circumstances. In 1999, five children were removed from the care of 
their Manchester foster parents after one of them, a 4-year-old girl, was 
allegedly burned with cigarettes and forced to eat her own excrement. 
In fiscal year 2003 there were 95,214 allegations of child endanger-
ment statewide, 20,322 of which were substantiated by DCF . . Of these 
20,322 unlucky children, 1.437 were physically abused, . 4,528 were 
"emotionally. neglected, II 12,053 were II physically neglected," and 573 
were sexually abused. In New Haven alone, 1,387 cases of child endan-
. 
germent were subst;mtiated in 2003. In the mid 1990s, responding to 
similar statistics and to the shocking deaths of Jones and Hernandez, 
DCF changed its philosophy. Whereas the agency had once pushed for 
family preservation at all costs, it now began to place the well-being of 
its children above family, stability, and community 
all things lauded 
IO 
by the old administration. With this shift in policy came new prob-
lems. Workers were now hyper-vigilant and, fearing the consequences 
of new beatings o:r additional suicides, began to yank children out of 
their homes at the slightest signs of parental indiscretion. 

Once removed from their homes, though, many children were 
- victims of further abuse. These ·children 
molested, beaten, starved, 
and neglected 
req~ired medical and psychiatric attention that DCF 
could no·t always provide. Consequently, some of Connecticut's most 
difficult children were being placed in some of the state's most inexpe-
rienced foster homes, with parents green to the very idea of foster care, 
let alone the notion of ~aring for special-needs children. Five years ago, 
faced with a pending class action lawsuit, a handful of tragedies, and 
endless criticism from the press, DCF initiated a bold project, the 
Supportive Housing for Families Program (sHF), which promised con-
structive change and maybe even a solution. 

Two weeks ago SHF was presented with the Touch of Life Award by 
the United Way of Greater New Haven. The award was a sign that 
DCF's reputation is on the mend. Yet this reputation hangs in a delicate 
balance, as one of DCF's biggest threats is also one ,of the hardest to 
. gauge. Betsy Cronin, Program Director for SHF, points out that one of 
the biggest problems facing DCF in 2003 is . the difficulty of reunifYing 
reformed parents with their children. 

When parents go to jail or check into drug treatment centers, they 
give up everything 
property, possessions, and. their children. Once 
rehabilitated, parents can regain custody only if they find adequate 
housing. But the housing market in Connecticut is expensive and 
options are limited. The farther one ventures from New Haven, where 
drugs and crime routinely tear families apart, the more one has to pay.

The result is a disheartening cacch-22 in which parents who wane co 
reconnect with their children are prevented from doing so by the tur-
bulent past they are trying to leave behind. They cannot take charge of 
their new lives, since rene everywhere--shore of the most ravaged 
neighborhoods in Connecticut's worse cities-is high, and landlords 
are unwilling co accommodate crack addicts, prostitutes, and criminals 
looking to launch their American Dream. Without a stable home to 
return to, their children are left to the whims of a crude foster care sys-
tem.

ORMA HAS LONG BLACK HAIR. SLEEPY EYES, and a smile that oscil-
lates berween guarded, nervous, and friendly. We chat at a table 
in the middle of an old ballroom at the SHF office in New Haven. 
Her story is fragmented, her words alternately convoluted and familiar, 
melting together into a classic story of mental illness, urban poverty, 
and loss. 

SHF officials, the champions of the nuclear family, sit on 
either side of us, watching as I ask Norma about drugs, lost children, 
and pain. Upon first impression Norma does not seem to be a mem-
ber of a functional family. She has one 16-month-old son, a teenage 
daughter who lives with Norma's adoptive dad, and a 7-year-old who 
has lived with his paternal grandmother since he was four months old. 
Her family seems markedly dysfunctional, yet many mornings SHF 
delivers the paper to her little country apartment, gives her rides, helps 
her with errands, and dispenses neighborly advice. 

Her life is 
remarkably normal. 

As a child, Norma was given up for adoption 
after her mother was deemed 
unstable. She hated her new parents, especially her adoptive father. 
When she was 13 years old, she ran away to New Haven, where she 
knew her mother resided. Norma spent three rain-soaked nights look-
ing for her house, asking strangers whether they knew her. Eventually 
she found someone who directed her to a house on a street that no 13-
year-old had any business visiting. She rang the doorbell, scared, excit-
ed, full of hatred, love, and confusion, and was greeted by the woman 
who had given her up years earlier. After Norma introduced herself, 
the woman cold her co leave and never come back. 

Norma started doing drugs when she was 15. She would gee high 
during the day because doing it at night was coo scary and too emo-
tional. Soon she got pregnane and gave birch co a daughter whom she 
immediately turned over to her adoptive father. Her drug abuse spi-
raled out of control, and after having three more children, rwo of 
whom the state permanently removed from her care, she ended up in 
jail. After being released she faced che possibility of seven more years 
in prison. She was a physical and emotional mess, but somehow, she 
started co improve. She sobered up, gave birth co a fifth child, a baby 
boy, and got involved with SHF through The Connection, 
a comprehensive community organi-
zation established in 1972,

"in response to the devastation being wrought 
on families as a result of addiction, crime, 
abuse, and neglect." 

SHF has a strategy for dealing with people 
like Norma. For recovering addicts or child 
abusers, the biggest barrier to good parenting, 
aside from mental problems, is affordable and 
safe housing. SHF is first and foremost an 
advocacy group which specializes in finding 
suitable housing for its clientele. Since land-
lords do not readily hand over property to the 
type of people in need of state intervention, 
SHF forms its own relationships with local 
landlords. According to Cronin, SHF is in 
good standing with over 50 landlords in New 
Haven alone. The organization also employs 
two full-time housing coordinators who 
inspect tenements, ensuring cleanliness and 
livability. Once housing is found, SHF leaves 
it up to the state to help parents cover rent. 
Many SHF clients qualify for a state voucher 
that reduces their rent to a flat rate of 30 to 40 
percent of their income. Parents who would 
otherwise need to work three or four jobs can 
now work only one, and still have money for 
groceries, clothing, transportation, and 
school supplies. 

SHF understands the danger in giving 
former addicts disposable income in 
neighborhoods where drugs are 
readily available. But they also know 
that placing addicts in neighbor-
hoods where drugs are not prevalent 
is expensive. Part of SHF's task is to 
strike a compromise, to fmd a place 

N ITS INITIAL PLANNING OF SHF, the 
Department of Children and Families 
rejected the idea of building new housing 
projects, knowing full well that an entire ten-
The Connection, Inc. (SHP) 
ement of fragile people could be more dan-
gerous than a single household of the same. 
DCF also rejected the idea of expanding 
Connecticut's transitional housing system. 
The system, as officials saw it, was good for 
certain types of people--the loner looking to 
be reintegrated into society, the juvenile 
offender-but was inappropriate for families 
who needed to rebuild stable households. 
Once released from transitional care, parents 
these families would be admitted to the hous-
ing program. 

To date, the number of people SHF has 
helped does not even approach the number of 
Connecticut children neglected in 2003. 
Even so, SHF thinks it has discovered a tenta-
tive, albeit counterintuitive solution to 
Connecticut's problem: Give kids back to 
their neglectful or once abusive parents to 
reestablish a traditional family, but pair these 
reunified families with caring individuals who 
are not overworked social workers, but pro-
fessionals whose sole task is to ensure day-to-
day existence. Give SHF administrators a lit-
de money, stick them under an established 
umbrella organization, and pray for change. 

ORMA NOW LIVES IN THE COUNTRY, 
away from New Haven and five miles 
from the nearest bus stop. If she want-
ed to get high these days, she would have to 
carry her 16-month-old boy over an hour to 
the bus, scrounge up enough money for the 
fare and for drugs, and then somehow get 
back home. This is too much for Norma. 
She spends most of her days bored and alone, 
save for her son. 

In this svste01, 
there are no 
Norma's situation reveals the limitations 
of the program that has tried so 
hard to save her. Four of Norma's 
five children are gone, either living 
with relatives or lost to foster care, 
and she still must wrestle with men-
tal illness and unemployment. She 
now has small support networks. 
far enough from urban centers to be 
safe, and close enough to urban cen-
ters to be affordable. 

Good geography, however, is 
not enough to reunite struggling 
parents and fragile children. The lairvtale endings. 
SHF drops in and helps her out 
when needed. She has reconciled 
with her adoptive father, and visits 
her oldest daughter on a semi-regu-
lar basis. "Our relationship is more 
final task SHF officials face is rehabilitation. In 
conjunction with DCF caseworkers, SHF devel-
ops a battery of wrap-around services for its 
clients, including counseling, vocational 
training, transportations, help with ettands, 
and general support. As Cronin noted, some 
families are so far in debt that they cannot 
even turn on the electricity in their new 
homes. Solving such problems is SHF's spe-
cialty.

still might not make enough money to pro-
vide housing, and their children would 
inevitably return to state custody. 

DCF finally decided on a "scattered site 
model" 
that had worked in other states. 
They gave this scattered site program a name 
and a budget, and erected it so that a family 
could develop a plan-of-action with DCF case-
workers. If they followed this plan, exhibited 
good faith, and filled out an application, 
sister-sister or friend-friend," she 
explains. She refuses to take credit for her 
daughter's upbringing, in which she played 
no part, giving full credit to her adoptive 
father. She has also recently started speaking 
with her real mother, the same woman who 
coldly rejected her as a girl. 

But this long-awaired reconciliation was 
almost Norma's undoing. When she revisited 
the house, Norma found her mother a differ-
ent woman, softened by encroaching senility.
