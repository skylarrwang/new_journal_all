UNSATISFIED AND DESPERATE, I decided to seek 
professional help. I needed a watering hole in 
the emotional tundra that was my life. So I 
arranged to meet with radio talk-show host, 
New Haven Advocate advice columnist, and 
self-proclaimed "Love Queen," Dr. Linda 
Olsen. As I waited inside the Chapel Street 
Starbucks, my imagination ran wild about the 
woman behind the crown, a woman whose love 
life I could only begin to imagine in my wildest 
dreams, a woman who in a deep, smoky voice 
shared her hard-earned boudoir knowledge 
with America's emotionally needy. I heard 
"Love Queen" and thought "Queen of the 
Night." Dr. Linda, however, did not have copi-
ous amounts of cheap plastic jewelry, dangling 
bra straps, or an alias of "Madame Chloe." The 
stylishly coiffed blonde I met that sunny after-
noon in Starbucks screamed Greenwich, not 
Greenwich Village. Clad in a cream-colored 
dress-suit and multi-carat cut diamond ear-
rings, Dr. Linda looked sort of normal. 


I only knewÂ· Dr. Linda from her weekly 
column in the Advocate, but I soon learned that 
she is much more than a sex advice columnist. 
A clinical psychologist with a doctorate from 
Emory University, as well as a trained therapist, 
she preaches to the lovelorn across Connecticut 
as the host of the radio call-in show "America's 
Love Doctor." But she is far from satisfied. Dr. 
Linda won't settle for anything less than the 
summit of her field: "You know how Martha 
Stewart is the 'Home Queen'? I want to be the 
'Love Queen,"' she declared. I was excited by 
the prospect of being coached by a trained 
expert 
someone who has honed the art of 
"partner selection" down to a science. I believed 
I was in good hands. 


We sat down at a cozy table near the win-
dow, and the doctor began to decipher the mys-
terious code that is love. "You have to under-
stand the basics of partner selection," she 
leaned in to tell me. "People, particularly teens, 
just don't understand. You have to ask yourself, 
'Who am I? What do I want? What do I want 
in a partner?' If you don't know what you want 
or what you are, you can't give much to a rela-
tionship." I think I know the answers to those 
questions, but what if my 'Mr. Right' has 
already passed me by? "There is definitely no 
such thing as just one soul mate," Dr. Linda 
reassured me, "but rather three or four that 
you'll meet in your lifetime." 


I sat fascinated as Dr. Linda continued to 
reveal her teachings. She is a proponent of the 
theoretically-based 
and 
"clinically-tested" 
"Imago Theory" of partner selection, which 
claims that each person possesses an inner 
"Imago." According to Dr. Linda's website love-
doctor. com, "Your Imago" is the image carried 
in your mind of that 'perfect partner' who can 
make you feel complete. The Imago forms dur-
ing childhood and draws on a combination of 
the positive and negative traits of the people 
who raise you. In essence, each of us will be 
irresistibly drawn to three or four "perfect" 
mates during our life-mates who will all share 
defining traits with our parents. These select 
few are our "Imago matches." These matches 
are supposed to be able to complete the unfin-
ished business of our childhood. "You're find-
ing the lost part of yourself," Dr. Linda 
explained. 


I had never thought that I might not be 
"whole." The idea of love as a scavenger hunt 
for self completion terrified me. I needed to be 
convinced that fulfillment was indeed possible. 
For Dr. Linda, her own romantic experience is 
proof enough: "I followed my high school 
sweetheart to college," she told me. "I didn't 
have a due about partner selection. I eventual-
ly decided he wasn't intelligent enough for me 
... that's why I left the relationship." Now hap-
pily married and the mother of three young 
boys, Dr. Linda believes Imago worked for her. 
"Don't settle," she advises, "What attracts you 
[now) will irritate the crap out of you later." 


Soon Dr. Linda will be doling out more 
than mere advice. She is currently managing 
the release of her product line, "The True Love 
Collection," set to hit stores this Valentine's 
Day. The "Collection" will include everything a 
couple needs to keep the flame alive, including 
the "True Love Journal, the "Gourmet 
Chocolate Lovebite," and the "Journey to 
Love" musical CD which articulates in song the 
Imago Theory stages of love. 


At this point, my doubts mounted about 
having a love counselor at all. As reassuring as 
this packaged advice sounded, I found myself 
Starting to feel repelled by the prospect of a 
trademarked path to love. After all, shouldn't I 
be learning these love lessons on my own? Love 
therapy and counseling is popular these days, 
and Dr. Linda is just one of many catering to a 
lovesick American public. Her radio show was 
rtcendy syndicated and her book will soon hit 
shelves everywhere. Imago Theory could 
become a national phenomenon. Dr. Linda's 
advice has the potential to help people all over 
the nation, but on at least one issue in life, this 
londy romantic is a conservative. For matters of 
the heart, Frank Sinatra is still the only Love 
Doctor I need.
