EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The school has had success in creating a 
close-knit environment, where the entire fac-
ulty collaborates to monitor student progress. 


Individual students are discussed at faculty 
meetings, allowing teachers from different 
subjects to comment on ways to help trou-
bled students. One student at the school; 
once known for her disruptive behavior, has 
learned that this attitude is not acceptable at 
this school. The student now voices her opin-
ions in class and has become a discussion 
leader, Baldwin said. Her accomplishments 
showcase the founder's primary goal: prepar-
ing students for college by teaching them to 
speak out, participate, and think on their 
own. Instead of rote memorization, students 
learn what questions to ask when they are 
studying and how to develop their own ideas 
and criticisms from the material they are 
â€¢ 
gtven. 


But Baldwin does more than philoso-
phize. He wears more hats and more latex 
gloves than most principals, who only inter-
act with students through chance hallway 
confrontations. Along with being a teacher, 
secretary, and guidance counselo~, Baldwin 
also acts as a "hall monitor, custodian, and 
lunchroom supervisor." Baldwin and Gavrin 
knew life at a small school could be like this, 
and Baldwin cherishes the intimacy that 
allows him to develop a stronger, more casual 
relationship with students. The couple hopes 
to stay at New Haven Academy until they 
retire, and Baldwin imagines his school 
becoming a resource for the greater New 
Haven community. But this, he says, "is like 
a rookie saying what he will do when he gets 
really good." For now, Baldwin is busy hand-
ing out city bus tokens, and answering 
phones.
