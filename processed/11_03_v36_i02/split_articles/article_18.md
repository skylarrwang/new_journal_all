may actually kill off the native and threatened 
species. 

Last spring, the Connecticut DEPrefused 
to grant the town permission to use the her-
bicide in the lake, arguing that a certain 
threatened species in Lake Quonnipaug, the 
water marigold, might suffer the same fate as 
the Cabomba and Eurasian milfoil. Currently, 
the Gee is negotiating with the DEP to secure 
permission to apply a limited amount of her-
bicide to targeted areas without endangering 
the rest of the lake. 

Even Bugbee wonders if it might not be 
. 
better just to let the lakes be. Leaving the 
southern channel that morning, Bugbee turns 
to look at the lake he has known for so many 
years. He muses aloud that he would not 
mind leaving it be. Bugbee is, however, con-
cerned about preserving the lake's biodiversi-
ty and protecting the local species, and is 
working in conjunction with the town to 
develop alternative ways of slowing the 
growth of the dreadful Cabomba. In his opin-
ion, it all boils down to a combination of sci-
ence and politics. Bugbee is currently helping 
to launch a comprehensive study of the 
effects of herbicides on aquatic weeds for the 
state, set to begin sometime next year. 

In the meantime, the best course of 
action for dealing with Lake Quonnipaug 
remains a mystery. In a world where land val-
ues are determined by aesthetics, and where 
people cling to the memories of past after-
noons on a pristine lake, it does not seem 
likely that the town will be willing to turn its 
lake over to the weeds 

Before Bugbee returned to the GAEC to ~ _ 
write his report, he dropped anchor in the 
heart of the lake. Stooping like a doctor over 
an aging body, he recorded the lake's temper-
ature and measured its oxygen levels. As he 
revved the engine and coasted back toward 
the boat launch, he pointed to where con-
struction workers were building a large win-
dow-filled house on the bank. 

A year earlier, the owner of the house-to-
be had called Bugbee to ask if there were 
weeds in the lake. He wasn't going to buy 
land and build if his investment would swift-
ly lose its value. And Bugbee told him what 
he knew, that they were working to keep the 
weeds under control. At this point though, 
only time can tell if the view out the house's 
new windows will be the one the owner want-
ed.
