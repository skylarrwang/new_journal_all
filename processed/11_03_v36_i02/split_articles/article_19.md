**Yale's Portraits: A History of Neglect and Ridicule**
**Author: Not specified**
**Page number(s): 26-27**

NOVEMBER 1965, Branford College 
accepted a donation of four paintings by 
French contemporary artist, Max Papart, 
valued between four and seven thousand dol-
lars each. While the donor had given the 
paintings to Branford College in order for 
students to experience contemporary art "in 
an everyday environment, instead of a muse-
um," most students ignored them. At Yale, 
we have grown used to eating our apple tofu 
crisp in ·the company of dark portraits of 
white men in suits. We dine in the midst of 
what the curators jokingly refer to as the "Yale 
Worthies," 
men 
with 
names 
like 
Fayerweather, Gaylord, Billings, Jessup, 
Luquiens, and Eleazar. And we don't give 
them a second glance. 

These formal portraits, though often 
ignored, are occasionally the targets of food 
fights and practical jokes. The archaic, osten-
tatious paintings of authority figures preside 
over dining halls, where generations of 
stressed-out students have been armed with a 
limitless supply of oily food and a little too 
much time. On Saturday, February 10, 1973, 
Yale Poli~e conducting a routine check of 
Commons noticed an abnormally bright, rec-
tangular spot on one wall. A painting was 
missing. The thieves weren't very careful, as 
the frame and back were circled by an array of 
sneaker marks beneath the space where the 
portrait had hung. Even so, the painting was 
never recovered. Occasionally, students add 
their own art instead of stealing it. In 1982, a 
portrait of Solomon Porter was removed 
because the "cheeks, ears, and lips of the sub-
ject appeared to have been defaced with a felt 
tip pen." Paintings are regularly caught in the 
line of fire in food fights. A Calhoun Dining 
Hall master's portrait was permanently dam-
aged when a meatball smashed neatly through 
the subject's face. When a roof leak damaged 
three portraits in Commons, the conservator 
couldn't bear to handle them, writing in his 
report that the works were "[too] disgusting 
to touch 
they had food, grease, and heaven 
knows what else on them." But Solomon 
Porter, the Calhoun Master with a taste for 
meatballs, 
and the three soggy "Yale 
Worthies" were not thrown away: They were 
kept cloistered in a basement gallery known 
simply as "Bs7." It is a graveyard for paintings 
laid to rest alongside their fallen comrades 
and stained with deep gummy oils, darkened 
with the weather of years of thumb prints or 
ripped neatly by massive food fights. Here, in 
BS7, aged masters look out dumbly from 
behind masks of hateful red paint with fork-
pierced eyes, as congealed drips of crimson 
berry pie m n down their faces like tears. 

Why should Yale spend the money to 
conserve these soiled paintings, or even keep 
them at all? Why should anyone care? As any 
snooty art major will tell you over Sunday 
brunch, these portraits are not even well-exe-
cuted. Some of them are horrific, painted in a 
style that would amuse any six-year-old. Rosy 
cherubic faces are squashed against sea-foam 
green backdrops and their shoddy canvases 
are bordered in gilt frames so ridiculous they 
seem like relics from a baroque opera. The 
paintings' subjects are just as dull: Men sit 
uncomfortably in haunted, dark worlds, their 
hands folded neatly in their laps, their white 
collars starched crisply, their handsome 
Windsor knots choking them at the throat. 

But the portraits, if not artistically interest-
ing, are at least historically important, argues 
Jennifer Bossman, the Yale University Art 
Registrar whose job includes keeping an 
inventory of these works and their decaying 
conditions. "Portraiture at Yale is an ongoing 
tradition," she explains. "The first piece of art 
the Yale Art Galleries acquired was a portrait 
of King George, and paintings of historical 
figures are at the core of the gallery's collec-
tion." Bossman adds that she considers his-
torical context when deciding where to hang 
newly restored portrait. She tries to shift por-
traits to appropriate locations 
for example, 
hanging a recently acquired portrait of John 
C. Calhoun in the Calhoun dining hall, or 
replacing a crumbling portrait of William 
Law Learned with a large and inelegant 
painting .of George H. W. 
Bush in 
Commons. Bossman and other workers in 
the art registrar's office have tried to assemble 
a sort of pictorial history 
checkering Yale's 
walls with historically important portraits, as 
if eating beneath these exonerated figures will 
give students the knowledge held by the wise 
figures of their University's past. 

Bur two dining hall paintings have sepa-
rated themselve.S from their peers. These are 
the portraits toward which groups of bored 
students, sleep-deprived and short on conver-
sation, can always turn for inspiration. 
Students love to hate the modern portrait of 
current Master Steven Smith hung just to the 
left of the Branford Dining Hall's huge fire-
place, and the surreal portrait of Master Stout 
hung in the center of the wall opposite the 
.Berkeley dining hall entrance. 

Master Smith stares at us from a dull, 
dingy office, his torso curving in and out of 
the painting like a slippery fish. Behind him, 
a snowy Yale courtyard glows in the watery 
sunlight, the bare branches of dark trees 
wavering as if seen through an aquarium. 
The portrait, commissioned by the class of 
1997 
the first graduating class over which 
the master presided 
is unlike any other 
portrait at Yale in that it was commissioned 
as a surprise for its subject. The class of 1997 
asked their classmate, James Prosek, to paint 
the portrait from a photograph of the master. 
As a graduating senior, Prosek was well 
known for his paintings of trout. He had just. 
completed a best-selling book of watercolors, 
"Trout: An Illustrated History," and his 
classmates didn't think it would be a prob-
lem that he had never before painted a 
human. "This perhaps explains the slightly 
'fishy' look of the portrait," Master Smith 
explains. Though his portrait is admittedly 
wacky 
Master Smith's glasses rest lopsided 
below his oversized forehead, his necktie is 
painted in a fierce cadmium yellow with the 
face of an unknown woman smudged in its 
lower half-
it. is successful, not as a portrait, 
but as a caricature. It captures Smith's like-
ness, conveying his quirky, constant energy 
through pulsing loopy brushstrokes. Smith 
appears gaunt and squirmy, as if painted by 
Egon Schiele, if Schiele had used Lucian 
Freud's somber palette. Despite its bleak 
color choices, Smith seems happy and 
untroubled. He doesn't look foreboding or 
snooty, despite his high perch and isolation 
from the audience behind a broad wooden 
desk. Indeed, the portrait's success rests in its 
lack of pretension. 

Smith's tie is loose, his jacket unbut-
toned, his shirt wrinkled . . The room sur-
rounding him is not ostentatious or even ele-
gant, but simple and modern. It does not dis-
tract from its subject. Granted, the actual 
painting isn't very well done. It feels muddy, 
the reflection floats like a mirage in the desk, 
the subject is backlit and the lighting doesn't 
work. In addition, the composition is child-
ishly symmetrical and the local color of the 
white shirt reflects poorly against the snow in 
the background. But at least this paint.ing 
does not pretend to be something else. It is 
different than the "Yale Worthies" crowding 
the room 
men like Charles William 
Harkness and Joshua Huntington, William 
Maxwell Evans and George Lincoln 
Hendrickson 
distinguished men with indis-
tinguishable portraits. 

And then there is the infamous "Skip in 
Space," a portrait of Master Harry "Skip" 
Stout, so nicknamed by those who frequent 
the Berkeley dining hall. The portrait, in all 
its strangeness, is the subject of constant 
ridicule. When current master John Rogers 
sent out an email asking students if they 
would be willing to contribute a portion of 
the college's funds toward a frozen . yogurt · 
machine, one student replied asking where 
the master's priorities were: "We shouldn't be 
concentrating our money on ice cream when 
we could be allocating funds to build a force 
field to protect us from the flying Berkeley 
shields headed straight for our heads!" But 
the portrait of Master Stout, painted by 
Berkeley Associate Fellow R. Beggs, is no 
laughing matter. 

During his first year as Master, 
Stout approached Beggs on a visit to the 
painter and filmmaker's San Francisco home. 
Beggs took over fifty photos of Master Stout, 
who was too busy to sit for him, and also 
"took pictures of all the preceding portraits to 
remind [him] of what [he] wasn't. interested 
in doing." Committed not only to capturing 
his "likeness" and his authority, Beggs 
attempted to convey Stout's spirit on the can-
vas. "While hardly conscious, I made a series 
of decisions about what the portrait would 
be," explains Beggs. "[Stout] was a friend and 
a bearer of tradition. There is an irreverence 
about him but also a dignity and seriousness 
of purpose. The idea of Berkeley as an insti-
tution and Harry embodying that institution 
and at. the same time passing through, transi-
tory, like all the previous masters, was an 
underlying idea. The relaxed figure, open col-
lar, and the darting College ~ms are manifes-
tations of those ideas, at. the time felt, not. 
acknowledged. Hindsight is great. n
