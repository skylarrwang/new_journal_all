Being and Nothingness 
' 
ON THE CROWDED POSTER BOARDS around 
Yale's campus, one can almost always find 
a tacked-up flier that boasts the alluring 
benefits of yoga, meditation or Pilates. 
Despite the current pop culture obsession 
with 
physio-soulful 
nourishment, 
Buddhism at Yale, a relatively new mem-
ber of the Yale Religious Ministry, is more 
than a passing fad. With a permanent 
home in the Indigo Blue Center for 
Buddhist life at Yale, and a chaplain dedi-
cated to the cause, Buddhism on campus 
promises to be more than a new millenni-
um trend. For several years, Yale Buddhist 
Chaplain Bruce Blair, class of 1981, has 
been quietly. and lovingly sprinkling the 
seeds of Buddhism in 'the campus's rockiest 
areas 
these places that exist not . in the 
landscape, but in the mind. Blair seeks to 
alleviate the feelings of desperation, angst, 
fear, and anxiety that are familiar to so many 
Yale students. According to Blair, we have all 
tried at one time or another to deny these 
feelings rather than to cope with their reality. 
Blair is trying to create a space for Yale stu-
dents to explore and recapture their lost real-
ity 
a space where people ~an contemplate 
"fitting into the myth," as Blair puts it, and 
perhaps attempt to understand life's difficul-
• ues. 

According to Blair, Buddhism is a space 
in the modern sense of the word. In the feng 
shui of Yale, in which each organization and 
department form part of an academic and 
spiritual aesthetic, Buddhism sets out to be a 
"source of our strength that gives us the 
capacity to be who we are." It is about broad-
ening our perspectives and eschewing reli-
giosity or routine. It makes us ask the difficult 
questions: How are we supposed to feel? How 
do we relate to one another? Does it matter? 
Blair cites the nation's contemplative 
mood in the aftermath of September II as the


source of Yalies' newfound interest in 
Buddhism. Many religious leaders thought 
students should have a place to go cope, 
grieve, and think in the long hours between 
9pm and 3am. In typical Zen fashion, Bruce 
suggested that silence would be the most 
effective way of reaching out to students. The 
religious ministry agreed. "Most of the people 
who showed up who were most distraught 
were not those who had lost people in 9/n. It 
was people who had lost people but hadn't 
grieved until that time," Blair says. "9/n 
brought questions to mind that people had 
not taken the time to consider." These expres-
sions of delayed grief were a ·precursor for 
"Silence, Candlelight, and Tea," a new daily 
observance between midnight and 2am in 
Battell ChapeL "It is a place where people can 
be alone with their questions," Blair says. 

According to his philosophy, as our thoughts 
race faster than our feet and our ignitions 
turn to over-drive, sometimes we iose sight of 
the reason we are here. Buddhism asks us to 
be aware of our uniqueness. In silence, we can 
actively listen to the things we are most 
likely to tune out and consider the why 
behind our particular existence. 

This Zen movement is not only about 
going to meditation instruction on 
Monday and Wednesday evenings. Nor is it 
about stopping by Battell for tea and quiet 
during midterms (though both are highly 
recommended.) A dedication to Buddhism 
requires much more than observing for five 
minutes, however pleasant or beautiful. 
These beginnings are easy, but the rewards 
of Buddhism do not ~orne so quickly. 

Blair's work aims to create a lasting space 
on our campus, a bastion of scholarship 
and learning that is comfortable not having 
all the answers . 
.In Western culture, the word "empty" 
has acquired a negative connotation. If 
something is empty, it is in some way inferi-
or. But in the Buddhist teaching, to empty 
oneself can be cleansing 
we finally hear the 
rhythmic clicking of your fingers on a key-
board, the icy scratch of a pencil on a note-
book, the chiming bells of Harkness tower. 
"We can very easily become our criticisms," 
Blair observes. "The Dharma teaches we need 
to work from a pla.ce of love not from a place 
of fear. We must learn how to truly honor 
ourse ves. 

But for all Blair's instruction, he knows 
that Buddhism is not really meant to be ver-
balized. "The Dao that is spoken is not the 
real Dao," he laughs, aware of the paradox of 
discussing Buddhism as part of an article, or 
..... 
as anything outside of the internal sel£ But 
this article is neither posing as the Dao, nor 
as a mission. "It is absolutely necessary to 
speak of this in a way that's not confronta-
tional," Bruce said concernedly. "It is about 
Truth, Tone, and Timeliness," he said. This 
applies to both Zen master and disciple, to 
those outside of.Zen, and even to this article.
