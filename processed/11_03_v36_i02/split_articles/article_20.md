EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Painted in a style reminiscent of neo-expressionists like Eric Fischl and David Park, 
Master Stout smiles, basking in the reflected 
haze of a far-off fluorescent light, Berkeley 
shields flying like icy bullets toward his smil-
ing maw. The work's composition is more 
interesting than those of its classical com-
rades. The subject is pushed to the left edge of 
the rectangle, and the shields lead our sight 
from the right corner back to the left. While 
it seems like the master is floating in space, 
this hazy dark background is almost more 
natural than the phony constructed atmos-
phere of a traditional office. Stout's casual 
attire 
open shirt, and rumpled suit 
feels 
more realistic than the robes donned by his 
colleagues. This portrait is certainly different 
from those surrounding it. But Beggs is still 
not entirely satisfied: "Certain things could 
have been pushed more. It's a hard call. 
Whose happiness and satisfaction is at stake?" 
Ultimately, a painting's success can be 
measured by the opinions of the students 
who view it daily. So mock these two portraits 
all you want. Admittedly they are not that 
good, but they are not as bad as one might 
think. Portraits like those of Stout and Smith 
are successful because they are interesting, 
because they are different, and because their 
painters had the courage to embrace change 
instead of pushing for the traditional and out-
moded. These paintings are less authoritative, 
less strict, and less archaic. They are less like-
ly to be vandalized with red pens, because 
they already seem to mock themselves. They 
are less likely to end up in basement storage 
rooms, a meatball shot through one eye. And 
you can be sure of one thing: If they are 
stolen, everyone will notice.
