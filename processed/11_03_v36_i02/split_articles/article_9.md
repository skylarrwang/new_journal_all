School ofThought 
TucK F.D IN FIVE FORMER OFFICES, at the end 
of a fluorescent-lit hallway, above the 
Connecticut Mental Health Center, is the 
newest addition to the New Haven Public 
School system. New Haven Academy opened 
this fall, but just barely. The magnet school 
gained accreditation in June, only three 
months before the fall term, leaving little 
time to recruit students and teachers. The 
Academy organized its own admissions lot-
tery for its first class of 65 from a pool of 250. 
But those accepted won a dubious prize: 
admission to a school whose location had not 
yet been secured. 

In late July, just a month before opening, 
the school's founders, the husband and wife 
team of Gregory Baldwin and Meredith 
Gavrin, secured a second-story office space 
off Nicoll Street. This last minute accom-
plishment came after six hard years of prepa-
ration. In 1998, the couple left their jobs at 
the Institute for Collaborative Education, a 
thriving magnet school in New York City, 
hoping to create a similar school in New 
Haven. When they arrived, they spent a year 
meeting with anyone in NHPS who seemed 
willing to provide a support system. When 
they finally opened, these connections proved 
invaluable. 

New Haven Academy does not resemble 
the prototypical high school with spacious 
hallways and rows of lockers. No one chats in 
the cafeteria or loiters in the hall. Students are 
always several feet from their next class. The 
closest thing to a cafeteria is a vending 
machine, and the library consists of a cart of 
laptop computers. Currently, the school uses 
the East Rock Magnet School library for its 
weekly school-wide "town meeting," and they Â· 
hope to secure use of the gym as well. 

Despite meager resources, Baldwin 
remains optimistic: The school's intimate 
space, he says, is actually conducive to his 
vision. The seven faculty members know all 
the students personally and because students 
are so physically close, no one can hide. "Two 
months ago I didn't know these 65 families 
that I now know really well," he said. 

Baldwin's program brings to New Haven 
an amalgamation of present public education 
philosophies. For example, the Academy has 
embraced a program called "Facing History 
and Ourselves," which examines historical 
movements of oppression. The related moral 
choices discussed within the class will inform 
his students' everyday decisions, and promote 
their civic engagement. As a member of the 
Coalition of Essential Schools, the Academy 
aims to create small, racially diverse and intel-
lectually challenging learning environments.
