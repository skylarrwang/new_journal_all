She also found the house a mess. People were 
getting high upstairs, and Norma craved 
drugs more than she had in a year. But for 
some reason, possibly the thought of her son 
back home, she did not get high that day. 
Instead she chatted with the woman she had 
once hated in the middle of a city she desper-
ately wanted to forget. · She continues to 
return there week after week, her craving 
more muted upon each return. 

HOUGH N ORMAS STORY is far from 
happy, she has fared far better than girls 
like Emily Hernandez and Tazjin Jones. 
But nothing can change the fact that she has 
lost four of her children. In this system, there 
are no fairytale endings. 

And for every innovative program like 
SHF initiated by the DCF, there is still an over-
burdened social worker, a forgotten child or 
an 
overlooked 
family. 
Maybe 
the 
Connecticut child welfare system is as good as 
dead. Maybe foster care is a doomed concept. 
But then again, through programs like SHF 
and programs yet unseen, the system has a 
fighting chance 
just as Norma did standing 
on a porch, decades ago, three days sleepless, 
pleading with a woman who said she would 
never accept her.
