**Beyond the Grave**

As I write, there is an exchange taking place 
about truth. But then the question arises: 
How do we communicate truth? Where do 
we listen for it? What language do we use? 
These questions get at the very heart of why 
it is important to talk about Buddhism as a 
philosophy and as a University presence. 
Whether in tea and silence, or in abstract 
musings, Buddhism at Yale may be able break 
the hectic cycles of college life. 
Beyond the Grave 
"My FRIEND PASSED AWAY 
this summer," a woman in 
the audience announced, 
brushing her hair back with 
her hand. "I was at my 
boyfriend's house, sleeping 
in the basemenc. I woke up 
and saw this black shape. 
Then I saw a white light 
coming out from behind it. 
It came out of this, like, 
white background." Her 
-Romy Drucker 
voice began to tremble. "The black shape 
looked like my friend. I think I saw my 
friend's ghost." 

Lorraine Warren shook her head. "No, 
that's not possible," she said. 
"She was drunk!" someone yelled. 
Spectators guffawed and murmured. "What?" 
the woman mouthed, speechless. 
"The figure of a human spirit would 
never be black," said Mrs. Warren. "Human 
spirits only appear as white." 

Lorraine Warren, Connecticut's celebrity 
ghost hunter, had just finished a spectacular 
two-hour lecture before an audience of 1_,300 
in an auditorium at Southern Connecticut 
Novnnn!R 2.003 
State University. Warren's grandmotherly 
demeanor belies her extraordinary powers. 
Bumping into her on the street, with her gray 
hair tied back in a bun, and clad in a black 
sweater speckled with large orange pumpkins, 
one would never imagine that she's one of 
America's preeminent experts on spirits and 
demonology and a co-founder of the New 
England Institute of Psychic Research-
membership $30. 

One also may not have guessed that Mrs. 
Warren can see "light transcendent media," 
but she can. "She can see your health, your

state of mind, before you even 
open your mouth," said Tony 
Spera, her colleague and son-
in-law. "Gold and red, for 
instance, mean a lot," he 
added. 

Warren does not appear 
to be particularly "clairaudial" 
or "clairvisual." But these sixth 
and seventh senses-the abili-
ty to see and hear supernatural 
phenomena-have propelled 
Mrs. Warrren and her husband 
through 55 lucrative years of 
"supernatural investigation and manage-
ment." The couple has dedicated their lives to 
battling goblins, sprites, and other "evil spir-
its who exist for the sheer purpose of oppos-
ing the works of God." 

Lorraine's husband, the equally famous 
Ed Warren, is a theological demonologist. 
From his title, one might assume Warren 
worships the devil. Not so. ":We worship 
God," said Spera, "because if you worship 
God, God is more powerful than any 
demon." 

Being on God's side, however, doesn't 
make demonology easy. Being born with 
super senses means you must work with 
demons who are not very good at following 
directions. Demonology is a risky business. 
"I've been punched, thrown across rooms, 
slashed. I've had burn marks across my body," 
Mr. Warren testified on a cas Halloween spe-
cial. Lorraine added that in the most deadly 
haunted houses, knives have flown across the 
room. "Some places aren't worth saving," she 
shrugged. 

The ghost-busting duo found each other 
more than half a century ago, while attending 
the same art school. In 1952., they founded the 
New England Society for Psychic Research, 
and since then they have witnessed 10,000 
"hauntings and paranormal activity," or 
about four ghosts a week. 

In the packed scsu auditorium, Mrs. 
Warren and Tony Spera showed slide afrer 
slide of indisputable hard evidence of the 
supernatural and taught the audience, mostly 
college students, how to interpret these pho-
tographs. 
"I'll point her out--eyes, nose, ears, spir-
it aura, " Warren said with the authority of a 
college professor, as she flicked her red laser 
beam across the screen to focus on the image's 
key features. 
"The woman you're going to see is a 
Satanist," said Spera gravely, before changing 
the slide. "See the monster in her hair?" At 
first the slide seemed only to depict a 
woman's hair, which had so much body she 
could have modeled for Vidal Sassoon, but if 
you stared hard enough you could just make 
out an angry, devilish face scaring right back. 

Ghosts appear on ftlm even when the 
human retina doesn't pick them up, Mrs. 
Warren explained. "All they have to do is 
think of what they want to look like, and that 
is how they appear," she said. Some choose to 
appear as floating orbs of light, some as 
Pillsbury Doughboy-like creatures, and some 
ghosts, called "avenging spirits," feign large 
wingspans for their haunting affect. "Oh my 


God. That's fucking scary," said the woman 
behind me. Indeed. 

"That's your typical Halloween ghost. 
You see the appendages 
arms, legs, hands, 
and head. But when there's one ghost, there's 
always more than one." When spirits congre-
gate with other ghosts to form a swirling tor-
nado, they are called "ghost veils," and they 
suck the energy out of the ground, typically 
leaving a cold spot in a cemetery. "That ener-
gy is drawn from animal and plant life. That 
is what the spirit draws upon in order to pro-
ject this image onto your ftlm." 

But it takes an expert to identify them. 
In one slide, what we thought was a ghost 
veil, with magnification, proved to be a col-
umn of dozens of faces of World War II vet-
erans haunting a living room. 

Sometimes, however, 
understanding 
spirits requires some historical background . 
For instance, in one photograph of a seem-
ingly ordinary window, Lorraine pointed to 
an image in the glass of two children in ante-
bellum-style clothes. But this was not a reflec-


cion, Lorraine explained, because the children 
had drowned 30 years before the picture was 
taken. 

One of the clairaudial segments of the 
presentation was an audiotape of Ed Warren 
talking with a spirit named Fred in 1977· 
Ed: "Were you a Christian?" 
Fred: [grumble, mutter} soldjah. 
Ed: What did he say? 
Other voice: He. said, "No, a soldier.

Ed: Aren't soldiers Christian? 
Fred: No answer. · 
Ed: Are you a Christian? 
Fred: [ruff! ruff!] 

Ed: What do you think of we Americans? 
Do you like us? 
Fred: [low growl] 

Ed and Lorraine have authored nine 
books including Deliver Us from Evz1, The 
Devil in Connecticut, and Werewolf, and have 
been the subject of two movies. Lorraine has 
continued the couple's educational lecture 
series at high schools and colleges across the 
country. 

Ed and Lorraine's basement, now con-
verted into a museum, harbors a collection of 
· "possessed artifacts." A Raggedy Andy doll, 
called Annibelle or the · "Devil's Doll," is 
responsible for the deaths and dismember-
ment of several who have dared to· mock it . 

"He died that night; she never walked again," 
Lorraine lamented. Now Annibelle is safely 
encased behind glass. There's a Ouija board 
alongside a collection of Hindu and Buddha 
figurines, costume jewelry, playing cards, 
busts, and plastic skulls. One fan wrote on a 
Warren fan club website, "Many times I have 
stared into Annibelle's eyes, many times from 
just outside the glass. It is truly an experience 
you would never forget."
