As it happened, Kruger and Healey never met 
for coffee (Kruger was headed out of town to 
do research for his senior essay), and these 
emails were the only private interaction 
between the candidates during the course of 
the campaign. When school began, Kruger's 
campaign was already well underway and 
Healey found himself in unfamiliar territo-

a competitive race. 


-IOlJGH HE HAD SERVED on the Board 
of Aldermen for two and a half years, 
Healey had never had to organize a real 
campaign. As a freshman, he was handpicked 
by Mayor DeStefano's staff to replace 
Alderman Julio Gonzalez (CC '99), who was 
leaving his seat to become the mayor's cam-
paign manager in the 2001 election. When 
Healey ran for the Board the following fall, he 
faced no opponent. But even though Healey 
has never needed to prove himself in a cam-
paign, he nonetheless dedicated his resources 
to his job and spent time molding the seat to 
his agenda. In his time on the Board, Healey 
has frequently criticized the nature of Yale's 
involvement in New Haven, and concentrat-
ed on issues reaching far beyond the Yale 
campus. This broad focus demonstrates a new 
path for the Ward One Alderman, and has 
engendered respect and dismay alike across 
the city. Gonzalez himself, now the Mayor's 
Executive Assistant, has only praise for 
Healey. "The platform I had [as alderman] 
was much less focused on the Yale relation-
ship to the city... [Healey] works on issues 
that are relevant to the community . real 
issues that people care about, " Gonzalez said. 


But Sledge recounts a far different history. He 
sees Healey's agenda as "narrow and relatively 
unimaginative," and refers longingly to the 
days of Gonzalez's predecessor, Josh Civin 
(CC'96), who combined a general dedication 
to the city with what Sledge calls "very specif-
ic student oriented issues." 


When Kruger announced his candidacy, 
Healey was waist-deep in his work for New 
Haven. He was struggling to promote the 
Naclerio Amendment, domestic partnership, 
new urban environmental policies, and clean 
elections. He was supporting Locals 34 and 
35, organizing the Immigrant Worker's 
Freedom Ride, and working with the 
Connecticut Center for a New Economy, 
pushing urban families to organize into a 
coalition of working people. A soft-spoken, 
twenty-one year old whose mild manners and 
easy smile belie his hard line politics, Healey 
was busy as usual. Now, for the first time in 
his young political career, he would have to

defend his platform against an opponent. He 
adopted "Students First" as his campaign slo-
gan. When asked why, Healey shrugged his 
shoulders. "Michael Montano (TD' 03) [a 
DeStefano campaign staffer] suggested it. He 
knew that's what I'd be criticized for." 


Kruger and Healey's first public con-
frontation was a debate organized by the Yale 
College Democrats in early September. 
Kruger thought Healey didn't take the event 
seriously. "It was pretty clear that he felt this 
[race] was just a fun thing .... He didn't speak 
well. He would say, 'This is our city, riiight?' 
and 'We need to take ownership; riiight?' You 
know how people do that when they speak? I 
felt like it was a high school debate." But if 
Healey began his campaign lightly, he soon 
rose to Kruger's challenge. And as the cam-
paign heated up in September, both candi-
dates began raising funds in earnest. Though 
Kruger had denied Healey's suggestion that 
"Yale stuff" was all that divided their plat-
forms, the tension between the University 
and the unions largely drove the support for 
each campaign. While Kruger accepted ·con-
tributions from Sledge and administrators at 
Yale's Office of New Haven and State Affairs, 
Healey received donations from organizers of · 
the New England Health Care Workers, the 
Communication Workers of America, and 
the Connecticut Center for a New Economy. 


In the Yale Daily News, a letter by James 
Kirchick (PC' o6) denounced Healey's affilia-
tion with union leader Bobby Proto by 
declaring, ''A Vote for Healey is a Vote for 
Proto." In a second debate, this time spon-
sored by the Yale Political Uniqn, Healey did 
not apologize for his financial backers and 
pointedly remarked, "You know ~..-ho our 
friends are, and you know who we'll be work-
ing with." 


This question of whom each candidate 
would work with once in office buzzed 
around the race like an aggressive mosquito. 
Master Sledge, observing how this election 
differed from those in the past, commented, 
"What's struck me 
and I don't feel like I 
fully understand this 
is that we're preoccu-
pied now with the power arrangements 
around the candidates, rather than the candi-
dates themselves." But it is no wonder that 
people with a long term investment in New 
Haven politics, like union organizers and 
Sledge himself, were concerned about who 
Healey and Kruger would ally with in the 
city. With former aldermen like Morand and 
Gonzalez shaping current New Haven poli-
tics, it has become increasingly clear that the 
young politician who holds the Ward One 
20 
seat is not a mere passerby. 


It seems a single alderman's 
term can launch a J.J.'-' .J.J<,J.JLUJ<. 
politician to the upper tiers 
of city power.

dominated the cam- · 
paign hype, power arrange-
ments could not 
the outcome of this · race. 
After all, the unions could-
n't elect Healey. Any elec-
tion hinges upon how well the candidates are 
able to reach out to their voters. In Ward 
One, where the constituent base is largely 
transient and historically indifferent, this can 
pose a peculiar challenge. Healey and Kruger 
not only had to court student voters, they also 
· had to convince them that New Haven poli-
tics matter in the first place. Many Yale 
undergraduates, passing through in only four 
years, feel that city issues do not affect them, 
and prefer to register in their hometowns. & 
Kruger has noted, "In the past I think that 
local politics in Ward One have been-viewed 
as something that is only in the interest of a 
few people who tend to see themselves as 
involved in this city, and therefore not as 
something the average person in Ward One 
should really be affected by or take part in, 
and I think that that's a misconception." Part 
of Kruger's mission, therefore, was "to change 
the political arena and broaden it," that is, to 
appeal to the silent majority ofYale students, 
and to reach out to students who might have 
been jarred out of their apathy by the sound 
of strikers banging pots at eight in the morn-
• mg. 


Kruger tried to engage the "average per-
son in Ward One" by canvassing all the col-
leges in the district. He went door to door 
introducing himself to his peers. First there

then, "My name is Dan Kruger and I'm run-
ning for Ward One Alderman. You're on the 
magic list of people registered to vote in Ward 
One, did you know that?" or some similar 
variation. Some students seemed interested, 
some didn't, some were out, and others were 
napping. Kruger tried to pique student inter-
est by attending Residential College Council 
meetings, an approach which won him little 
support. At these meetings, where discussions 
usually revolve around a field trip or the next 
dance, "I got almost no reaction," he recalled, 
"It was like I was a piece of the woodwork." 


Seeking a better way to present his plat-
form, members of Kruger's campaign orga-
nized a Master's Tea in Ezra Stiles College. 
This time he did get a reaction, though per-
haps not the one he anticipated. Armed only 
with a cookie and a cup of tea, Kruger found 
himself facing . a wall of students in green 
"Vote Ben!" t-shirts. He responded jovially 
enough. "I want to leave the majority of time 
for any of you guys to question me, to grill 
me, to use it as a sort of inquisition," he told 
the students. "This chair is sort of a rack ... 
you can turn me around and torture me any 
way you want." Indeed, they did just that. & 
the tea dragged on, Kruger's ears grew red in 
spite of his apparent good humor. 


As the race continued, Kruger's cam-
paign tactics demonstrated a profound 
naivete regarding the dynamics of this elec-
tion. When Master Sledge invited him to 
hold a reception in his home on October 27, 
Kruger accepted, sparking a fiasco that pro-
vided his opponents with ample material to 
label him "a tool of the administration." 
Sledge emailed his college an invitation to the 
reception, which uhleashed a volley of explo-
sive responses. Calhoun freshman Marissa 
Levendis sent a fiery email to Sledge and 
copied the email to all of Calhoun. 
Her 
words were scathing: "You, as the Master of 
Calhoun College, have the duty to not abuse 
the power you have over the Calhoun student 
body. Quite honestly, your contifl.l!al, con-
centrated support of Dan Kruger seriously 
makes me uncomfortable and makes me feel 
that you are seeking to pressure me, from 
your position of authority over me, to think a 
certain way about politics." Levendis was not 
the only one concerned by the master's 
endorsement.

Kruger offered to cancel the reception. "If I 
were the Master. of Calhoun College, I'm not 
sure what I would have done," he explained. 
However, when Sledge decided to proceed, 
Kruger followed suit. "It's not my role to 
decide what the Master should and shouldn't 
do." But given his self-described role as the 
race's independent voice one might have 
asked, why not? 


The evening of October 2 7 was cold and 
rainy. And while Kruger was attempting to 
engage students under Master Sledge's roof, 
Healey traipsed across campus from one stu-
dent meeting to another. He set out from 
Dwight Hall at 6:30 PM, using one of his 
campaign posters as an umbrella as he navi-
gated his way through the streets. His first 
stop was La Casa, the Hispanic cultural 
house. There was a black-out, and a dozen 
students sat in the living room, discussing the 
business of the evening while they waited for 
the lights to come back on. Careful not to 
interrupt, Healey pulled up a chair and 
leaned in, listening to their conversation in 
the dark. When it was his turn to speak, he 
introduced himself "To the people I don't 
know, hi, I'm Ben." After chatting for a few 
minutes, he passed around a volunteer sheet, 
thanked the group for having him and head-
ed back into the rain. His next visit was the 
AFL-CIO meeting back at Dwight Hall, then 
out again through the puddles to the Yale 
College Democrats meeting in Branford 
College. Later that week at La Casa, he went 
on to address the pivotal issue of Yale's rela-
tionship to the city. "I think that New Haven 
has a set of issues that we need to confront 
internally, and they deal with the power rela-
tions in the city ... [with] how an eleven bil-
lion dollar institution that is the biggest 
socio-economic engine in the city relates to 
the rest of the town. We all recognize that 
Yale is not going to solve the problems of 
New Haven, right?" 


Healey speaks in :1 
mild voice and calls con-
. tuents, labor organizers, 
no politicians "folks." He 
talks to students about the 
he's done as alder-
man and the work "we're 
doing together." While 
Kruger sought to bring

forums,

thought 
He wanted to 
them their broader 
ideals could be realized through city politics, 
and they did not need to rely on the 
University to effect change. After the meeting 
with the Yale Democrats on that rainy 
Monday evening, Healey headed back into 
the night, canvassing door to door, trying to 
engage students in the issues he cared about 
and was convinced they cared about, too. 


On the Saturday before the election, 
Healey sat in the Branford College court-
yard, attempting to concentrate on home-
work. It was a perfect New England after-
noon, sunny and crisp, with deep yellow 
leaves crunching under the feet of students 
walking by. The quadrangle is the pride of the 
Yale Admissions office. After the tour guide 
tells you that New Haven really isn't that dan-
gerous, she'll lead you into Branford. From 
inside, it is impossible to see any part of the 
outside world but the sky, and reality dis-
solves in a careful arrangement of gothic 
spires·. Healey had been trying to attend to his 
school work, but his Normative Ethics book 
sat uncracked on the bench beside him. "I 
know that there's a certain percentage ofYale 
students who are not going to want to~ do 
more than concentrate on their studies, live 
their college life, and get out of here, but my 
work is to make that percentage as small as 
possible by continuing to talk to people. This 
is our life here. This is our home." He gazed 
pensively at the autumn light on Harkness 
tower. "For me, the work is engaging the folks 
because the institutional bollndary doesn't 
translate into individual boundaries. I think 
we can all transcend them." 


Two days earlier, Kruger had discussed 
election ·day as he sipped his lemonade, and 
had characteristically looked on the bright 
side. "No matter the outcome, it's a win-win 
situation in my mind because we've started a 
debate, and gotten people talking about, real-
ly talking about the issues and the approach 
to politics ... which is great and that's some-
thing I'm really excited about and I'm proud 
of . . . If Ben is re-elected, I think that he will 
be a better alderman by my rubric, if you like, 
than he ·was before." 


These words, recalled after the election, 
make Kruger's loss less disheartening. He 
pushed Healey to think about his con-
stituents and reevaluate their bond with the 
city. He pushed Healey to redefine the Ward 
One seat as the link between his peers and 
what had become his home. And he pushed 
students finally to think about the course of 
New Haven's future. 


LECTION DAY WAS DANK and cold. 
Healey arrived on Old Campus at six 
in the morning, and held his ground 
resolutely until the polls closed at eight at 
night. Kruger shivered right alongside him, 
stopping passersby with a cheerful, "Hey 
there, have you voted yet?" When students 
packed into Dwight Hall to hear the results, 
Kruger was absent. "He had to go back to 
his apartment to let someone in," his cam-
paign manager explained. 


For most Yale students, as Kruger dis-
covered, the fate of New Haven remains a 
future largely unrelated to their owri. 
However, this race demonstrated the increas-
ing number of students who are invested in 
the city, and its outcome determined the 
way they hope to change it. In the last days 
of his campaign, Healey had told a group of 
students, "I think that we, as Yale students, 
tend to honor our University and look there 
for problem-solving because we don't know 
how to charter the outside sources." On 
November 4, voting students chose Ben 
Healey, not Dan Kruger by a margin of 
three to one. Perhaps they chose him 
because he was the incumbent, perhaps 
because they knew him personally, perhaps 
because they liked his t-shirrs. Or, perhaps, 
presented with two visions of the relation-
ship between Yale and New Haven, they 
chose to put their faith not in their 
University, but in the city, and in their alder-
man.
