To the Editor: 
It is oddly gratifying but fundamentally
distressing to observe the extraordinary
way the Sixties Myth "intimidates" you
"consciously" and "subconsciously." This period of "student 
protest" was not "a frivolous and 
misguided affair." Our essential problem was losing. 

Jolted by assassinations (Malcolm 
X, Martin Luther King, Robert Kennedy) 
and 
disrupted 
by 
illegal 
wiretaps, 
informers, 
agent 
provocateurs 
government 
conspiracies (Operation COINTELPRO, 
Operation CHAOS), we lost the large 
battles to transform American society. 
We did not end the war fast enough. 
we did not fundamentally redistribute 
wealth, we did not stem the arms race, 
nor did we end an imperialist foreign 
policy that still sides with oppressive 
dictators against movements for social 
justice, most evidently these days in 
Central America. 

Yes, Mr. Sides, it was a glorious era; 
free marches on Washington, May 
Day, and all the other protests were 
not primarily social events (despite admitted overindulgence in sex, drugs, 
and rock 'n' roll), but glamorous, ex-
citing 
ultimately 
important 
historical events-even at Yale! It re-
mains a mystery to me and others in the 
"Big Chill" generation who have not 
abandoned the causes which 
ignited 
our bright college years, why you and 
your colleagues do not rise with pas-
sion to the issues of your time. Surely 
Reagan's policies toward El Salvador, 
Nicaragua, Honduras, South Africa, 
Grenada and Chile must raise your 
ire? How can 
new escalations of 
nuclear madness or the ever more 
deadly threats of toxic waste, acid rain 
and other impending environmental 
disasters not 
inspire a 
passionate 
anger? And 
finally, 
how can you 
stand for the human mistreatment Reagan 
malevolently inflicts upon working 
people, the poor and the elderly with 
his evanescent "safety nets"? Where the 
hell are you people? We made many
errors 
born 
of excess 
immaturity - errors 
which 
can 
be 
recognized and avoided- but we never 
failed to fight. Mr. Sides, seize the 
time. 

Sincerely, 
Barry C. Scheck '71

**Letters: Delivering H.D. Whole**
**Author: Diana Collecott**
**Page number(s): 4-5**

As a foreign scholar drawn to Yale by 
the Norman Holmes Pearson collection 
in the Beinecke Library, I was pleased 
that you gave space to Katherine 
Scobey's substantial article "H.D.: the 
Making of a Poet" (TNJ, February 3, 
1984). 

Precisely because information about 
this poet has been slow to surface, we 
should be sure that it is accurate. Ms. 
Scobey's account of H.D. is highly 
resourceful, but I should like respectfully 
to correct its heterosexist assumptions. 

It is not true to say that H.D. "turned 
to bisexuality" after separating from her 
husband or to imply that her "lesbian 
impulses" were in some way occasioned 
by "male rejection." 

H.D.'s love for women as well as for 
men was already evident circa 1910, 
when her intimacy with Frances Gregg 
displaced that with Ezra Pound. This 
episode is fictionalized in HERmione, 
which describes the heroine's doubts 
about her engagement 
to 
"George 
Lowndes" and 
her deep 
sense of 
sisterhood with "Fayne Rabb." Far from 
being followed to London by "a smitten 
Hilda," Pound found himself introducing 
two young women to the capital.
Unfortunately Barbara Guest, in her 
biography of H.D., trivializes this affair 
between the 23-year-old Hilda Doolittle 
and 25-year-old Frances Gregg as "girl-
love" and is reluctant to take on the full 
implications of her later relationships 
with women.


Anyone wishing to understand more 
fully the resonances between H. D.'s life 
and her writings should also turn to two 
essays by Susan Friedman and Rachel 
DuPlessis: "Romantic Thralldom in 
H.D." in Contemporary 
Literature 20 
(1979) and "The Sexualities of H.D.'s 
Her in Montemora 8 (1981). 

These writers point out that: "Virtually
all of H.D.'s ... works ... drastically
underplay her status as a companionate 
woman and her connections 
through Bryher with homosexual and 
lesbian circles in Europe. At the same 
time, the narrative of heterosexual at-
traction, betrayal and victimization was 
a recurrent feature of her writing. Both 
her fiction and poetry frequently ex-
press her need to be delivered from the 
cultural scripts of romantic thralldom in 
which she repeatedly immersed herself." 

As women readers who share that 
need, we have a special responsibility to 
deliver H.D. whole. 

Yours faithfully, 
Diana Collecott 
New Haven, Ct.


**Letters: Toward Perfection**
**Author: Jeffrey W. Clark**
**Page number(s): 5**

I do not share Mr. Sides' view that it is 
arrogant to think that Yale should be a 
perfect place ("Shaving Cream on the 
Floor," TNJ, February 3, 1984). 

Personally, I think the whole world 
should be a perfect place. At the same 
time I don't cross the Green at 3 am. I 
realize that the world and the Yale com-
munity, as a part of that world, is not 
populated with people totally sensitive 
the 
needs of each 
other. (If 
Philadelphia can not live up to its name, 
how much worse the rest of the world 
must be.) 

Having faced that realization, what 
shall we do? Accept the situation and 
harden ourselves to the reality of the 
cold, 
cruel 
world out 
there (i.e., 
Buffalo)? Is it not better that we try to 
improve the situation? 

I, for one, applaud the approach of 
the Yale Students Against Violence by 
Yalies. They call upon the community 
to acknowledge that any behavior harmful 
to others is wrong, and to act accordingly. 
This is not a giant step to take, nor 
does it cram adulthood down our 
throats. We are fortunate that Yale of-
fers us so many opportunities to revel in 
our immaturity as it is. 

The arrogance lies, I think, in believing 
that since we are young and 
sheltered, our acts of violence (of 
whatever degree) should be tolerated as 
"blowing off steam," and that the vic-
tims should tend to themselves. 

Be seeing you, 
Jeffrey W. Clark

**NewsJournal: Congratulations**
**Author: N/A**

The New journal is pleased to announce 
the election of Peter Phleger, Silliman 
'85, as publisher effective April 20.


**NewsJournal: In Appreciation**

As graduation approaches, the magazine
will be losing a hard-working and 
dedicated group from the Class of 1984. 
We extend our thanks to Nicholas 
Christakis, 
Paul 
Hofheinz, 
Katie 
Kressmann, Tom McQuillen, Morris 
Panner, 
Laura Pappano, Vanessa 
Sciarra, Katherine Scobey, Sally Sloan 
and W. Hampton Sides for the talent 
and enthusiasm they brought to the 
magazine. Ed Bennett, who stepped 
down as publisher in September, will 
also be graduating. Ed refounded The 
New journal in 
1981, 
with 
remarkable energy developed 
editorial and business policies which 
have shaped the magazine. We wish 
them all the best of luck in the future.


**NewsJournal: Scholar of the Boat**
**Author: Wes Boyd**
**Page number(s): 6**

Steve Kiesling '80 set himself apart from 
his fellow Yale students and oarsmen 
when he made the US Olympic crew 
team four years ago. Although his in-
terests have led him in other directions 
since graduation, he has now returned 
to his first talent and is trying to make 
the 1984 Olympic team in a pair with 
former Yale teammate Matt Labine '81. 

Ironically, Kiesling thought of quit-
ting crew during his junior year-"Its 
all-absorbing nature became absurd," he 
recalled. Instead, Kiesling applied to 
the Scholar of the House program, hop-
ing to gain some perspective on athletics 
and academics. Specifically, he planned 
to make the US Olympic crew team in 
1980 and to write a book about it- a 
large project, especially for someone 
who had been rowing for less than three 
years and had never "written anything 
longer than a ten-page term paper." It 
took Kiesling months to write his pros-
pectus, and because of its main re-
quirement-making the Olympic team 
-he calls the proposal "his best selling 
job ever." It was accepted and his "en-
tire being became absorbed" in his 
goals. 

Kiesling made the Olympic team and 
wrote 
his 
project. The committee 
thought his work was "illiterate" and 
gave Kiesling a B. In fact several times 
during his senior year the Scholar of the 
House committee had tried to throw 
him out of the program. "They felt like 
they'd turned a jock loose to do nothing 
more than train athletically," says Kies-
ling. Instead of complaining, he revised 
part of the draft and got it published as 
The Still Gam~, which sold 20,000 copies 
and received favorable book reviews, 
including one in The New York Times. 

Kiesling then joined the staff of the 
new magazine American Health, where 
two years later, he has become senior 
editor. His work on an article for 
American Health inspired him to his next 
project: a video exercycle. From his 
research Kiesling concluded that video 
games are the "mental equivalent of 
sport" because of the stress they induce. 
When experimenting with a blood 
pressure monitor he claims he found 
them to be even more stressful than be-
ing with his girlfriend. 

So, 
with the 
help of electrical 
engineer Dave Potter, also a former 
Yale oarsman, Kiesling decided to hook 
up video games to exercycles. The 
result, the "aerobics joystick," required 
its 
user 
to peddle 
a 
bicycle to 
manipulate the video game's joystick. 
Although Kiesling went around the 
country on a promotional tour which 
included spots on The Today Show, CBS 
News and PM Magazine, he was too late. 
The video game craze had peaked and 
the public showed little interest. 

After these various projects, why has 
Kiesling decided to row again? He 
states, "My girlfriend was transferred to 
Paris. I had nothing better to do." 

Labine, his partner, attributes their at-
tempt to make the Olympic team to an 
"improbable combination of bizarre 
coincidences," adding a barely audible 
comment of "right place at the right 
time," without elaborating. As for their 
chances of actually making the team on 
what at first was little more than a lark, 
Kiesling playfully states, "They're get-
ting better all the time." 


**NewsJournal: Mail Stuffing**

We have to admit it. We were wrong.
In "Basketball Bounces Back" (TNJ, 
Dec. 7, 1983) we all but handed Y.U.
basketball an Ivy League championship. The team's subsequent 4-10 Ivy
League record (7-19 overall) landed 
Yale dead last in the league, disappointing
both players and fans. 

Apparently some people were more
disappointed than others. A recent letter
sent to Yale alumni across the country
attributes the team's poor season to 
second-year coach Tom Brennan. Calling
Brennan "an embarrassment to 
YALE," the writers charge Brennan 
with intolerable behavior on the court, 
exploitation of the team's black players
to win a coaching job at a larger school,
and all-around bad coaching. "He is,"
the authors say further, "an internal problem, one we would like to
take care of within the Old Blue Family
... before Brennan and his conduct
become a public issue." The proposed
solution: 
concerned 
alumni should
bombard President A. Bartlett Giamatti
and Athletic Director Frank Ryan with
letters demanding the immediate firing
of Coach Brennan.

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Who wrote this letter? A lot of people 
would like to know, but no one really 
seems to. The authors sign off with the 
cryptic "Yours very truly, Bill and jack 
Elis," and though the letter's postmark 
reads Houston, Texas, the writers do 
seem 10 have a better than long distance 
knowledge' of Yale basketball. 

Instead of getting Brennan sacked, 
however, the letter has had just the op-
posite results, sparking a burst of sup-
port for the ftery coach. Frank Ryan 
called the letter "one of the vilest pieces 
> of defamation I've ever seen," adding 
that it is the.only negative input he has 
l 
received concerning Yale basketball 
since Brennan became coach. Carl Ek, 
Vice-President of the Yale Club of New 
Haven and a recipient of the letter, said 
that the anonymous authors reeked 
with "the stench 
of hypocrisy." 

Giamatti would not comment on the 
letter. 

And Tom Brennan? Busy working 
,on improving his team, he said, "Of 
course it hurts, but I don't have any fear 
of losing my job. I can see how my style 
could offend some people, but it's hard 
to take this seriously when they don't 
sign their names. What can I say? As 
the team gets better, my behavior will 
~et much better. I'm just doing my job."

**Title: Beautiful Perspiration**

"People go to be identified with the 
people there," said one freshman male. 
"There are a lot of Beautiful People who 
are concerned with being beautiful from 
the neck down." Who would have 
thought that the hottest social scene at 
Yale right now would be the Payne 
Whitney Gym? The chic crowd is only 
one faction of Yalies who, joining a 
, growing national trend, have found a 
new way to unwind: an aerobicise class 
taught by sophomore Liz Pitts. 

At 3:45 every Monday, Wednesday 
and Friday afternoon, 80 to 100 people 
, cram into the largest room on the fifth 
floor and spend an hour stretching, lift-
ing, pulling and pumping their ~ies 
~ know gids who've gone out and bought 
u new leotards and stirrup tights just to be 
seen in the exercise class," said one 
junior woman, "and the guys who stand 
in the last row are there to scope. There 
are some exercises that I'm really em-
barrassed to do because there are 
always at least five guys looking in the 
window." 

into hard-earned shape. "It's the whole 
Jane Fonda aerobics syndrome," said 
Liz Massey, Davenport '86. "It'sjockish 
but not too jockish. You know-'1 can 
sweat and stilr wear make-up, too!'" 

Yale's answer to Jane Fonda is 
19-year-old Floridian Liz Pitts. Tall, 
blonde and physically fit. Pitts provides 
a role model for her peers. Hannibal 
Hodgson, Timothy Dwight '86, claim-
ed, "She's our goddess of pain. She's a 
symbol as much as a teacher. She has 
the Tom Sawyer effect of making 
something difficult look so easy." 

Pitts feels that the music she plays 
-everything from 
the Go-Go's to 
jazz- is a big reason for the popularity 
of the class, and students agree. "T'd say 
the class is definitely a turn-on, both do-
ing it and watching it being done,~ said 
Hodgson. "It centers around rhythm. 
There's a constant beat; it tantalize<; 
your primordial need for pulse.~ 

The sensual appeal of a room full of 
highly charged, exuberant bodies can-
not be denied, and the cla'>s has been 
called everything from "sexercise~ to 
"the body discovery of the century . ~ "I 

The "guys in the back" for the most 
part deny these accusal ions. "Guys 
stand in the back because they're em-
barrassed. I neve•· went to scope on 
girls," football player Paul Spivack, 
Timothy Dwight '85, said indignantly. 
"I don't see how you could do the exer-
cises and scope at the same time. 
Besides, I think that the girls are over-
confident as to how attractive they are." 

Wrestler Jirn Tannenbaum, Timothy 
Dwight '85, added. "You're so tired you 
can barely think. It's not the place to 
meet people." 

H owever, many refute this noble 
claim. "People go to sec and be seen," 
said one sophomore male. "They go out 
and buy jumpsuits together and talk 
about their Danskin colors." Brooke 
Runnette, Jonathan Edwards '87, said, 
"It's not so much that people get skinny 
doing it: they get skinny .for it.~ 

Some find the social aspect of the 
class annoying and disrupting. "I've 
gone from the bcl{inning," said Sarah 
Hutt , 
Calhoun 
'86, 
"and 
now 
I 
recognize a large contingent of BPs. 
Frankly, I don't get my kicks from 
aerobics. 
Sweaty. exhausted people 
aren't all that sexy. At this school JX'Ople 
are ah,ays searching for some artificial 
construct of status. and this is just the 
latest thing." 

But whatever the social motivations, 
football players. swimmers, crew jocks, 
sailors. 
hockey

and 
other 
athletes "do Liz~ and take the workout 
very seriously. As one runner put it. 
"This class rakes you over the coals. 
You feel like jello afterwards." Head 
football coach Carm Cozza commented 
wryly, "Anything that will make tbe 
pl~-ers a little more graceful can onl>• 
help us.~

the national fitness trend diminishes, so 
will the enrollment of Pitts' class. "Sure.

it's a fad," she admits, "but it's a fad that 
is beneficial. When people feel beuer 
they're going to keep coming.n 

Fad or no, physical activity and social 
interaction combine successfully 
for 
Yale students. "I think the class is really 
a 
fantasy," 
H annibal 
Hodgson 
speculates, "an escape into a world or 
rhythm and intensity. There's a strong 
dichotomy between the personal chal· 
lenge and the social pressure you're 
dealing with. You play the two tensions 
off one another, and your body does 
awesome things."

**Title: Plato Goes Video**
**Author: Joyce BanerJee**
**Page number(s): 8-9**

One sunny afternoon, Socrates and 
Meletus attack each other in a Yale Law 
School classroom. Fists and togas fly· 
ing, they wrestle to the floor. Then the 
camera stops filming, the fighting ends, 
and scene three of Ken Goldstein's 
movie Apology is complete. The motion 
picture, which marks the first use of 
videotape 
in 
the Theater Studies 
department, synthesizes Goldstein's ex· 
perience as a Theater Studies/Philo-
sophy major. 

Goldstein, 
Timothy 
Dwight '84. 
came up with tpe project several yea~ 
ago when enterrng his unique major. 
Initially planning to film Plato's Apolo!J• 
Goldstein later decided to adapt the 
work to college life. "I want to show hoW 
great literature and philosophy affect 
students' 
thinking," he explained. 
"Philosophy becomes viable in people's 
lives but they often abuse the wisdorn 
they find." 

"The Dialectics of Youth," as Apolo~ 
is alternately titled, focuses on four 
students who seek direction and mean· 
ing in their college experience. Senio~ 
pre-med Brett Rosen discovers Socrates 
ideas and haphazardly applies them to 
his own unsatisfying life. In the process 
he loses his girlfriend Michelle Barr>:· 
but gains freshman John Peters as h•s 
friend and protege. Enter Tripp Mar· 
cus III, who dislikes both philosophY 


and Brett. Their enmity-and the 
movie -climaxes in a modern day re-
enactment of Socrates' trial, with Brett 
as Socrates and Tripp as Meletus the 
accuser. 

Though the film is based on classical 
philosophy, Goldstein does not believe 
the material will intimidate an au-
dience. "The movie is 
gear·cd 
anyone, not just philosophy majors," he 
said. "The philosophy is watered down 
to make it understandable." 

Additionally, Goldstein thinks Yalies 
can easily identify with the characters. 
"The students in Apology are all based on 
real observations," he pointed out. "I 
figure everyone at college is either a 
Brett, Michelle, john ot· Tripp. They 
are just the archetypes." 

Goldstein created the characters last 
fall when writing the screenplay, and he 
has devoted spring term to the casting 
and production of the film. In making 
the movie Goldstein uses videotape 
rather than the more widely used 16mm 
film; he believes that video has great 
potential in the performing arts. "There 
is a general snobbery at Yale against 
video," Goldstein said, "because people 
don't consider it to be an art form like 
theater. But they have to realize that 
video is here to stay." 

G oldstein plans a May 3 debut for 
Apology, and he thinks the film should 
be well-received. "It's a student film. We 
have no delusions of grandeur," he said. 
"But a high energy level will definitely 
come across."

**Title: Where the Aesthetes Eat: A Visit to the Elizabethan Club**
**Author: Tina Kelley**
**Page number(s): 10-11**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
If you have a key or a friend with one, 
you can come for tea in the very old 
Clubhouse at 459 College Street. A key 
is $1.50. Lifetime membership is $10, if 
you have friends with keys who will 
write kind letters about your ability to 
participate in "free and unaffected 
discussion." Over tea and sandwiches 
from four to six, members of the Lizzie 
talk about literature and the finer things 
in life. And their theses and their novels 
and their trips to England. And philosophy. And the sandwiches, which vary 
from cucumber to peanut butter and 
jelly.


Roger Pardo-Maurer, Branford '84, 
is sketching archangels on a blank post-
card back in the tea room. He laughs at 
the result. They are pulling a bedraggled 
man out of an ocean. He writes a 
caption beneath them in an awkward, 
childish scrawl. "It's from the 34th 
psalm," he says in his Costa Rican ac-
cent. "But I found it on a bridge while I 
was traveling this summer in Czecho-
slovakia. It sounds much better in Ger-
man." He demonstrates. His favorite 
poems are Rilke's Duino Elegies. He is 
memorizing them in the original Ger-
man. It wouldn't be worth his while to 
do it in English, he says. "I think we 
should have ostrich egg and seaweed 
sandwiches instead of those!" He points 
to the linen-draped table with its tea-
service, Pepperidge Farm cookies, and 
deviled ham sandwiches, which he 
dislikes. 

The living room, the first on the 
right, is painted a chalky forest green. 
The table lamp lights the stacks of 
Punch, London News and Country Life 
magazines, and the picture of Alex-
ander Pope, a lovely portrait, the front-
ispiece for many fine editions. The 
elderly man in the leather chair beneath 
it looks like Pope, except his hair is 
greyer and he has fewer wrinkles. He 
very well may have lived his entire life 
indoors. 

"Look at this, isn't it beautiful?" He 
points to a picture of a sixteenth-
century Tudor mansion in the issue of 
Country Life he is reading. "And only 
£80,000." He doesn't pause to calculate. 
"That's only $120,000 for a lovely 
manor house in the country. You've 
been over, of course?" He has crossed 
the Atlantic forty times. His eyebrows 
are long and grizzled. 

The vault is open only on Fridays. If 
you leave your tea, cookies and pipes 
outside, you can browse among price-
less first editions of Paradise Lost, rare 


Shakespearian folios and a 1558 copy of 
The Quenes Maiesties Passage through the 
Citie of London to Westminster the Daye 
before Her Coronation. But today is Sun-
day and you must satisfy yourself with 
The Quenes Maiesties portraits in the 
tea room. 

There is a knock at the door. Someone 
has forgotten his key. Matthew 
Lopes answers. He wears a mustard 
waiter's coat several shades lighter than 
his skin. He takes small steps and has 
served the Lizzie for over 25 years. 
"Hello, hello," he says to Elizabeth Ar-
chibald, a graduate student, who likes 
the Lizzie's food and fellowship so much 
that she once gave up the Club for 
Lent. Matthew goes back to the kit-
chen, where he keeps a short-legged, 
long-haired 
dog 
that 
growls at 
everyone. 

Dan Duffy '83, according to one 
member of the Club, has the face of a 
macho cherub, a perfect face with green 
eyes. He also laughs extremely loudly at 
public poetry readings. He directs a 
series of them at Timothy Dwight Col-
lege and is starting a press to publish 
New Haven poets. Dan Duffy can write 
a page in his head and see it all at once. 
"I can tell . . . where the words repeat 
... and how they look ... in relation 
to each other," he says in between long 
exhalations of pipe smoke. "It's kind of 
like ... the electric signs they have in 
Times Square. You know ... the kind 
where the words come out ... all in a 
line ... in letters made of green dots? 
... That's how I see my thoughts ... 
when I write." 

No one interrupts Dan Duffy. No 
one's ever sure when he's done talking. 
His pauses are profound and thought-
ful. It would be terrible to interrupt 
those strings of green dots. 

The vault room is sunny. King Lui 
Wu, vice-president of the Elizabethan 
Club, sits by the window. He teaches a 
course entitled "Daylight and Architec-
ture." "When I design a building I want 
it to be human- to be concerned with 
people," he says. "I design modern 
buildings but I build with the view of 
the past and the future, from the 
substance of the past, and though you 
can't see any of the past in it, it is in 
there." 

Wu likes to study philosophy and 
poetry, disciplines he likes because they 
also build on tradition. "I urge my 
students to read poetry," he says. "It 
humanizes them and their architec-
ture." Wu writes verse of his own. He 
looks aside and leans his head back. "I 
write in Chinese, I do not think my ... 
command of English is good enough to 
write English verse," he says, smiling. "I 
only show it to a very few friends who 
speak Chinese. There are two ways of 
creating art, the analytical way which is 
more with your head, and then the in-
tuitive way, with your heart. I get more 
pleasure from the creative way, and 
here we are lucky in an academic set-
ting to just be able to enjoy it." 

"What's going on in the kitchen?" 
Tim Cone, a law student, is upset. He 
brandishes his deviled ham sandwich at 
Elizabeth Archibald. "It's Sunday, isn't 
it? Why isn't this date nut and cream 
cheese?" Elizabeth Archibald does not 
know. Maybe Matthew would. "Well 
I'm not sure if cream cheese and date 
nut made sense with Sundays, or if 
Sundays made sense with cream cheese 
and date nut," Tim Cone explains to 
anyone who will listen, "but you can imagine my profound dismay when I bit 
into this!" Tim Cone is going to be a 
corporate lawyer. He makes significant 
eye contact. Rumor has it that he made 
an innocent Newsie kiss him before he 
would tell her where Matthew keeps the 
teabags for the Lizzie's brew. Matthew 
doesn't use teabags. 

Matthew takes empty tea cups off the 
tables in the vault room. How are you? 
"Oh fine, fine." His voice is deep but 
wavering. This place is always pretty 
busy, yes? "Oh yes, yes." 

What have 
you been up to, Matthew? "Oh, the 
same old thing. And you?" The answer 
is always much longer. 

King Lui Wu loves poetry because it 
is so precise. "With just a few words you 
can capture what in a novel would take 
up perhaps four pages," he says. He 
studied poetry in China, where he grew 
up. After studying English there for a 
summer, he enrolled in Yale. "My tutor 
wanted me to go to England, but the 
war in Europe was approaching then 
and my father thought it would be bet-
ter to go the United States. But I tra-
veled to England later, seven or eight 
times. And to Italy too. There are many 
beautiful architectural styles there." He 
smiles. "The Pantheon has one tiny hole 
in the ceiling, one very small hole, and 
it is only about 4 percent of the area of 
the floor, but it lets in a beautifully dif-
fuse light, like old wine, instead of 
whiskey. 

"I've designed everything from a 
house to a bank to a church. In China, 
now they have different ideas, so it is a 
very different challenge to build there. 
When I designed a church in New Ha-
ven I had to learn about the religion." 

He gets up to leave. The sun has left the 
vault room. 

"I think the best profession in law is 
that of a tax lawyer," says Tim Cone. 
"You see, when you reach my stage in 
life (and you will) you'll find yourself 
looking for that special person." Tim 
Cone makes significant eye contact. "A 
tax lawyer spends all of his time finding 
shelters. A woman loves a shelter. A 
corporate lawyer settles down in a posi-
tion of financial security that women 
admire." (Meaningful glance.) "As I 
said, my views aren't terribly compati-
ble with feminism. But after I'm settled 
down and married, then I can go into 
public advocacy and that sort of thing." 

The old grandfather clock in the liv-
ing room strikes six. Matthew turns off 
some lights in the tea room. The old 
man who looks like Pope hopes the 
sandwiches will be date nut and cream 
cheese next Sunday, but he says this 
quietly, so as not to offend Matthew. 
Dan Duffy is going to hear one of his 
friends, "the sensitive poet," read new 
work over old tobacco. Tim Cone must 
leave now; he is meeting someone for 
dinner. Soon Matthew is left alone with 
the Shakespearian folios and the dog 
that growls. And a plate full of deviled 
ham sandwiches.

The Secret Link 
Rich Blow 
Steve Kohn came to New Haven this 
fall to hire Yale's most talented seniors, 
men and women who were extremely 
bright, were proficient in a foreign 
language, knew how to use a com-
puter 
and loved their country. In 
return for their skills Kohn could offer 
them careers in one of the world's most 
powerful institutions. But Kohn does 
not work for Morgan Stanley, nor 
were the 40 seniors who heard him talk 
interested in working on Wall Street. 
Steve Kohn is a recruiter for the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency. 

Kohn's visit to Yale is an important 
part of the CIA's largest recruitment 
drive in three decades. With the strong 
support of President R eagan, 
the 
Agency is vigorously looking for new 
blood and turning to universities 
across the country to find it. At more 
than 400 schools nationwide, including 
the entire Ivy League, the CIA is busi-
ly searching for the spies of the ·so s. 
C IA advertisements can now be found 
in newspapers and magazines from 
coast to coa.st, from the Los Angeles 
Times 
to 
Wall 
Street Journal. 
Students are responding: as many as 
2000 resumes 
reach the C IA 
m 
Washington every week. 

National recruitment is only a recent 
innovation for the C IA. During its be-
ginning years the CIA sought its 
agents almost entirely from just three 
schools: Yale, Harvard and Princeton. 
Yale graduates in particular would 
come to dominate the Agency, giving 
it the familiar tone of a class reunion. 
Since the formation of the C IA in 
1947, Yalies have found the world of 
intelligence an exciting alternative to 
the slower pace of academia or the 
dangers of front-line fighting. Once 
established within the CIA, Yale grad-
uates sought out their old friends and 
classmates to work alongside them, 
creating a network of Ivy League con-
nections that would control the Agency 
for decades. 

Gaddis Smith, Larned Professor of 
History, now says, "Yale influenced 
the CIA more than any other institu-
tion did. The Agency was very much 
an Ivy elite. It was thought of as roman-
tic and mysterious and it attracted the 
Big Men on Campus." 

Some of the names are familiar: 
William F. Buckley, George Bush, 
William Sloane Coffin. 
However, 
there were many other Yalies who 
entered the CIA whose names and 
stories are not so well known. James 
Angleton, J ack Downey and Richard 
Bissell were part of this group of men, 
creating a world of spies where you 
could still fraternize with your Yale 
classmates. 

James 
Jesus Angleton '39 was 
a brilliant but eccentric man. After 
graduation from Harvard Law School 
Angleton took the advice of his old 
English professor at Yale, Norman 
Holmes Pearson, and joined the Office 
of Strategic Services (OSS), the war-time predecessor to the CIA. Pearson, 
himself a former member of the OSS, 
later said that Angleton took to the in-
telligence business "like a dog to 
water." 

It was in 1943 that Angleton joined 
the OSS; by late 1944 he had assumed 
control of OSS counter-operations 
against the Axis powers in Italy. For 
the patriotic 28- year -old, known as 
"The Poet" because of his fondness for 
Ezra Pound, it was an astonishingly fast 
rise to power. 

Not surprisingly, Angleton moved 
on after the war to the CIA, a fledgling 
organization which desperately needed 
his expertise, his connections and his 
natural aptitude for intelligence. In 
1951 he created and headed the Agen-
cy's counter-intelligence division, the 
first of its kind in America. For the 
next quarter-century Angleton would 
reign as the American master of coun-
ter-intelligence, maybe the best at his 
job in the world. He was obsessed with 
flushing out Soviet agents, constantly 
intent on discovering KGB "moles" 
within th~ CIA. His critics, however, 
thought h1m paranoid (Angleton con-
sidered them probable Russian agents) 
and would by 1974 get him fired , 
casting Angleton out of the intelligence 
community. 

The habits of a spy are deeply in-
grained in Angleton, and he refused to 
talk about his career when questioned. 
His speech reflecting a lifetime of suspi-
cion, Angleton would only say, "I've 
never heard of your magazine. I don't 
know what political slant you may 
have, or what you may be trying to 
prove. A nd I don't like talking about 
my personal life. I'm sorry, but that's 
all I can tell you." 

Ex-CIA agent Jack Downey, now 
Chairman of the Connecticut Public 
Utility Control Authority and a former 
candidate for the U.S. Senate, is not so 
secretive. At Yale Downey was a self-
described jock who played on the varsi-
ty football, wrestling and rugby teams-
as Gaddis Smith put it, a Big Man on 
Campus. He was an English major 
who had the bad luck to graduate in 
1951 at the height of the Korean War. 
On the advice of Political Science Pro-
fessor Arnold Wolfers, Downey at-
tended a CIA recruitment meeting in 
the spring of his senior year. He still 
remembers it clearly: "Everyone was 
looking for the best deal he could get, 
and the CIA was a glamorous option. 
Unlike the situation in the Vietnam 
War, it was taken for granted that 
you'd serve in some way. It was either 
the CIA or fight in Korea." 


--- Page 14 ---

Downey chose the C IA. Unlike An-
gleton, the ex-athlete moved into the 
operations side of the Agency rather 
than work in intelligence analysis. He 
recalls that in tratntng camp "half of 
my class was from Yale, Harvard or 
Princeton." Despite his decision not to 
join the military, Downey was not un-
committed, nor unpatriotic. "My at-
titude," he said, "and that of my Yale 
classmates was that the war was a 
direct result of a Communist probe 
that had to be resisted. We really 
believed that the free world depended 
on the United States. Today, that must 
sound a little naive, but I still think it's 
basically accurate." 

Downey paid for his convictions 
with the loss of 21 years freedom. In 
November of 1952 he was captured by 
Chinese Communist troops in Man-
churia. He had flown into the country 
to meet with a CIA agent working 
there, but the rendezvous had gone 
wrong; the C IA's plant had been dis-
covered, and Downey and his crew 
were ambushed. Until 1973 Downey 
was held captive in a Chinese prison, 
cut off from the outside world. Finally, 
as Cold War tensions were receding 
and Richard Nixon was normalizing 
relations with China, J ack D owney 
was allowed to return home. Eleven 
years later he has the humor and 
strength to say, "I'd planned to take 
some time off after college, but it 
turned out to be a lot longer than I had 
planned." 

While Downey was languishing in a 
Chinese prison, another Yale graduate 
was working his way up the C IA lad-
der. Confident, brilliant and ambi-
tious, Richard Bissell came from a 
background familiar to the intelligence 
community: Groton 
'28, Yale '32. 
After teaching at Yale and M IT Bissell 
helped formulate the Marshall Plan. 
The C IA was a logical next step, and 
Bissell joined the Agency in 1954. 
With surprising understatement Bissell 
now says he joined the CIA simply 
because he thought it would be "an in-
teresting job." 

Within a year Bissell had assured his 
success at intelligence-gathering. 
Almost single-handedly he developed 
the U-2 reconnaissance plane, a tre-
mendous breakthrough for an intel-
ligence service which, nearly a decade 
after its inception, still knew embar-
rassingly little about the Russians. For 
four years U-2 flights boldly took pic-
tures of the Soviet Union until, as one 
of Bissell's contemporaries said admir-
ingly, "It was impossible for the Soviets 
to lay a sewer pipe in Siberia without 
CIA knowing it." Though the U-2 pro-
gram would come to an abrupt end 
with 
the shooting down of Gary 
Powers in 1960, Bissell's reputation 
was untouchable. By that time he had 
already developed the satellites to 
replace his plane. 

Bissell's extraordinary talents were 
quickly noticed by CIA Director Allen 
Dulles, who in 1959 made Bissell the 
CIA 
Deputy 
Director 
for 
Plans 
(DDP). After less than five years as an 
agent, Bissell had become head of the 
covert action arm of the CIA. "At the 
time," B.issell now says wistfully, "the 
political climate for the job was very 
favourable, probably more so than at 
any time since." 

For Bissell covert action often meant 
covert 
assassination. 
In 
1960 
he 
ordered the death of African Jead~r 
Patrice Lumumba through the injec· 
tion of a lethal virus into Lumumba'S 
toothpaste. The plan failed. In that 
same year Bissell woulrl supply guns to 
the political opponents of Rafael Tru· 
jillo, brutal dictator of the DominicaJl 
Republic. Some of these guns would 
later show up in the hands of the rnen 
who killed Trujillo. 

But because of pressures from John 
and Robert Kennedy, Fidel Casu{) 
became the CIA's main target. Work· 
ing with old schoolfriend Tracl' 
Barnes, also a graduate of Groton and

**''It Worries Us Too:'' Children's Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament**
**Author: Katie Kressmann**
**Page number(s): 18**

The meeting was an exercise in con-
trolled mayhem. Ahhough only seven 
people showed up, the clamor of their 
voices and laughs easily filled 13-year-
old Katie Janeway's 
lan~e. brightly 
decorated bedroom. It seemed in-
congruous and unlikely that this group of 
allracti\'C and lx>isterous adolescents 
should be gathered to discuss strategies 
for opposing nucl<'ar war. Fourteen-
year-olds Karen Gt•rsten and Jessica 
Williams, co-founders of the 
t ew 
Haven Children's Campaign 
for 
Nuclear Disarmament, sat with Karen's 
12-year-old sister Sara on the floor. The 
twins Moira and F'anya Cutler, also 14, 
cha11ered with tlwm from the bed and 
beanbag chair. Thirteen-year-old Josh 
Bloom wandered restlessly around the 
room, examining Katie's things and 
flicking small 
o~je<.ts at people who 
weren't watching.

New Haven chapter has appeared oa 
local and national television, spoken to 
classes, written letters and organiztd 
rallies to educate people about the issu< 
of nuclear arms and to promote l 
nuclear freeze. It is also the hea:: 
chapter of the international CCND. 
which has over 70 chapters in countritl 
including France, England, Swedt11 
and Japan (but none in the Sovicl 
Union). Although the group provic:ks 
children with a way to work out thc:ll'

most meeting time is spent doin( 
business- reading petitions and letter!. 
organizing smaller groups and plannin( 
fund raising and rallies. Currently tht 
group is working on the "Students fora 
Future" rally to be held on the New 
Haven Green in early May. 
"You have grown-upc; <>aying, 'Let me 
out of here. I don't want to think about 
it,"' said Moira. 
"If we all have these nuclear weapons 
around when we grow up the problem 
will still be there," said Josh. "There are 
people who say that you don't have to 
worry about it, that you should just live 
now and enjoy the world, don't think 
about it ... " 
"But that's wrong," cut in Sara em-
phatically. "By pushing it aside you are 
just procrastinating until there's trou-

house, 14 Everit Street in New Haven. 
"We get 100 letters a week," Donald 
said, the heavy steel chains on his wrist 
jingling as he shook an impressive 
three-inch thick packet. "People write in 
from all over to ask about CCND," he 
explained. "They ask how to start a 
chapter, how to introduce their children 
to the issue of nuclear arms or what the 
group is doing." 
Some people send in donations, 
others write 
to 
cntlc1ze, 
accusing 
CCND of being a Communist organiz-
ation. The group does not worry about 
the people who already oppose disarma-
ment. "You can't get through to them," 
said Karen. "Even if you do there is no 
way of knowing; it is like working 
against a concrete wall. You can only 
convince the ones· you can talk to. The 
kids arc hearing." 

One of CCND's most successful ac-
tivities has been class presentations on 
the topic of nuclear arms. "It was 
strange to find out how many people 
didn't know about what was going on 
and how much we could teach them," 
said Karen. The fifth-, sixth-
and 
seventh-grade audiences they address 
are usually completely uninformed. 
Few know that nuclear weapons have

ever been used, much less that the 
bombs were dropped by the United 
States. Generally working in pairs, 
members go through the 
11-page 
CCND pamphlet explaining the history 
and use of nuclear weapons from the 
first use on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to 
the modern arms race and peace move-
ment. Each has his own approach. "If 
you can find someone who is pro-nuke, 
the best way to get into it is by arguing 
enthusiastically. "We don't try to scaJt 
them, and I think we succeed in nol 
scaring them. We give them the fa<.15 
and we don't really force an opinion: \It 
simply say this is the state of things and 
this is what you can do," said Donald. 
Sara, who became a CCND member 
just this year, confirmed the influence 
of CCND's talks. "I was in a class last 
year, and you guys came and talked, 
and I know that all through lunch and

with them about it, and then you can 
bring up points," said Josh. 

Their talks have a strong effect. "At 
the beginning of class you come in on a 
bunch of sixth graders all babbling at 
the top of their mouths. They don't pay 
any attention to you, but 15 minutes 
later they are all sort of staring at you, 
you know, and by the end of the class 
they have so many questions that it's 
impossible for you to leave," said jessica 
all through the next day everyone ~·~ 
like, 'Wow did you hear those k1dsj 
They sure know a lot about it. Maybe 
should get involved.' It did start to rnaJ<e 
people think about it." 

The students learn more than histon· 
from CCND's presentations. "It is io· 
teresting to them because they arc 
scared, and they see that as kids we arc 
talking to them and we know whll1 
is happening," said Karen. "rm sure '


t of them realize that there are other 
roups made up of adults. They don't 
alizc that they have a voice and can 
se i1. The kids are not ignorant, but 
hey art• surprised that they can have an 
mpan." 

itting in her living room on a quiet 
estvillc side street, Karen seems more 
ike an average, even conservative, 
4-year-old than the co-founder of an 
ctivist group. Her short brown hair is 
lean and neatly brushed, and she 
ears jeans, a turtleneck and a lilac 
hetland sweater. Her speech is free of 
argon, and her voice is even, although 
t speeds up slightly when she says 
mething she feels strongly about, as if 
he were t'mbarrassed by the force of 
er feel ings. 
"I think that it is really likely that we 
will have a nuclear war soon, if we don't 
keep pushing harder. If I just sit back 
and let it happen then I am being 
really ... " she pauses 
while she 
searches for the right word," ... pitiful. 
I might as well do something about it 
because othenvise it will be inevitable." 
Her exuberant puppy tries to clamber 
o? to the couch, and Karen gently puts 
htm down. 

Karen got involved in CCND when 
her best friend j essica told her about the 
group and what they were doing. 
"T~ere was a letter-writing campaign 
gomg on, and she said that we could 
start a chapter. So first she asked me 
and all my friends to write letters. It 
took her about three weeks to get me to 
~nall_y write the letter, 'cause I kept put-
tmg 11 off, but finally I wrote it." That 
was when the reality of what they were 
protesting began to sink in. "We started 
thinking about what would happen. 
We're a mile away from the Green, and 
t~e target is the Green, and that was 
kmd of scary," said Karen. "It just kind 
of hit me. After that I think I was 
~?tivated to do something. Maybe that 
IS JUSt how I am-when I see something 
wrong I have to try and fix it. It makes 
me feel better, and I think it would help 
a lot of kids." 

Members are proud that they run 
CCND tht'm~t>Ives, explained Karen. 
"We've had a couple of problems with 
people saying '"ho's the director, who's 
running things, who's the adult here," 
"he said, .. except there's no adult- it's 
just kids, and we can tell you a few 
things that we have done, and what is 
happening here if you want, but there is 
no adult here. and wt" run it. E\(·rvcmc

"Nuclear war is a big thing," said 
Karen, "and I think that's why so many 
kids are starting to think about it, and 
saying, 'Hey we've had these weapons 
for 40 years and the adults aren't doing 
anything about it, maybe we should 
start speaking up- it worries us too.'" 

A Russian girl to whom Karen spoke 
by satellite when she appeared on The 
Today Show echoed the same sentiment. 
"I asked Tanya what she thought when 
people said 'You're only a kid, why are 
you doing this?'" said Karen. "She 
replied that she thought that maybe the 
leaders were getting senile, and of course 
we should be working on this- it's our 
world too.'" 

The parents and many teachers of the 
members of CCND are the grown up 
children of the sixties. Many were in-
volved in the activism of that time, 
something their children are very aware 
of, sometimes more than they are. "I 
have trouble convincing him that I was 
not a hippie in 
the sixties," said 
Donald's mother. 

Most parents agree that they have 
more respect for their children's opin-
ions than their parents had for theirs. "I 
think taking children seriously 
is 
something new," said Dr. Kim Jane-
way, Katie's mother. "Absolutely, hav-
ing a parent from· the sixties has had a 
big influence on these kids." 

"It 
important 
that 
they are 
respected as people, not treated as 
another species- sheltered, ignored, or 
controlled," said Liz Gersten, Karen 
and Sara's mother. "You want to listen 
with respect. Our respecting them frees 
them up to work with us too, it em-
powers them not to feel like an op-
pressed minority- that they must ac-
cept or rebel. They are responsible 
about their actions." 

The kids feel that they have come to 
their opinions on their own. "I was in-
fluenced by my parents, by the fact that 
I was educated by them," said Katie. "I 
wasn't told how to think. They told me 
what they thought and I could object to 
it if I wanted to. I think if my parents 
had been pro-nuke I probably would 
have objected to it, and then I wouldn't 
have been influenced by them." "I was 
brought up to disagree with my mother," 
said Josh. "It was 'Do what you want; if 
you agree with me it is a coincidence.'" 

The parents have another equally 
powerful legacy to pass on to their 
children. They have grown up with a 
knowledge and fear of nuclear weapons 
which has been reinforced by each new 
bit of information. Most remember 
hiding under their desks during air-


drills. "when no one thought we would 
be annihilated," said Dr. Janeway. "I 
don't think I thought then that we 
would be annihilated." 

Their feelings have deepened. "I have 
a fear that is like falling off a bridge," 
she said. "It is a real fear to me ... that 
this will hurt me physically and in many 
other ways." That same feeling, a con-
crete imagining of the effects of a 
nuclear war and a conviction that one 
could happen in their lifetimes, is 
shared by most of the members of 
CCND. They 
are 
not 
perpetually 
haunted by it, but the conviction in 
their voices when they speak of war is 
unmistakable. The parents did not need 
formal lectures to tell their children 
about their fear of nuclear arms; the 
strength of their feelings has come 
across in casual conversations over the 
dinner table. 

The parents see the issue of the 
nuclear arms race as one which cannot 
be eluded and must be dealt with in a 
responsible manner. "What they are do-
ing is the best possible response. They 
are facing up to the problem rather than 
escaping or ignoring it," said Dr. 
Charlie Janeway. "I think that it would 
be atrocious for them not to know that 
the issue exists, not to have a clear-
headed picture of what the realities are, 
and having that picture I don't see that 
there is really much choice how you 
stand on the matter." 

"It is so important to have some ac-
tion one can take," said Ms. Gersten. "It 
is helpful for all of us, particularly the 
kids, since they are more likely to feel 
helpless in terms of their whole lives. If 
you have control over a little piece then 
you don't despair." 

It seems to work. "I think a lot of peo-
ple have nightmares about nuclear war 
because they have no hope at all," said 
Karen. "It helps if you are doing 
something. Of course I think about 
nuclear war more than the average kid 
would, but it helps a lot. I don't have 
nightmares about nuclear war."

$55,000, a full-time staff and the large, 
stone Chi Psi frat house at 211 Park 
Street. 

About 
200 of Yale's 330 black 
undergraduates pay yearly dues of $30 
to join the Center. The AACC is at the 
center of a web of the University's black 
organizations. It houses the Black 
Church at Yale, the offices for the 
magazine Ritual and Dissent and student 
and non-student groups ranging from 
the Heritage Theater Ensemble to the 
Black Pre-Professional Council to the 
Yale Gospel Choir. On a given night 50 
to 100 people use the Center, and the 
Center's parties are something of a 
legend on campus_. 

Yet in the midst of the AACC's sue· 
cess, some students have argued that a 
separate social center for black students 
at Yale may contribute to racial pro· 
blems while attempting to solve them. 


~~~~~~~~~ The very raison d'ttre of the Afro-
American 
Cultural Center escapes 
white students. After all, the 
Board t?f Education decision to 
public schools became law 30 
this May. Yale is presumably 
most open universities in the 
complete with hardworking 
~""""'"-~"missions recruiters and

is the point of the AACC and 
minority organizations like Yale 
, the Asian-American Student's 
""""IR.O'""~~·ation and MeCha? Do these 
segregation 

me people may have been a bit sur-
• for instance, by the appearance 
ast year of Ritual and Dissent, •A Journal 
of Black Arts and Letters." Yale already 
had the Yale Dai!y News (YDN), its 
Magazine, The New Jour1UJ1, Tlte Interna-
tional Forum, Yale Political Montlrly and 
several literary magazines and other 
periodicals. There would seem to be 
plenty of room for black writers and 
issues in the existing campus media. 

Five or six blacks work at the YDN, but 
there are no black staff writers at Tlu 
Nav Jour7UJI and very few anywhere else. 
What's more, complaints about campus 
coverage of black issues have a long 
history at Yale. For example, Ritual tnttl 
Dissent editor Elizabeth Alexander '84 
has strongly criticized the YDN for its 


failure to cover a conference of black 
women writers at Yale in the fall of 
1982. Among the speakers was the 
Pulitzer Prize-winning Alice Walker, · 
author of The Color Purple. 

If coverage of black issues on campus 
has been poor, then why haven't more 
black writers worked within the existing 
publications to fill the gap? Even Alex-
ander is unsure why many black writers 
shy away from mainstream publica-
tions. "Is it after they've submitted 
something and it's been rejected? Is it 
after they've worked with an editor who 
hasn't really understood what they were 
trying to say? Is it just this huge general 
perception that they don't want to write 
for white people? You can't know that. 
For me it's a combination of all three of 
those things and the excitement of 
wanting to do something myself." 

Whatever the reasons for the low 
black profile in Yale publications, Ritual 
and Dissent staff members vigorously 
argue the need for the magazine. 
"There still is a need to address issues 
pertinent to black Americans in a forum 
that is devoted to that end," said AACC 
director Caroline Jackson '74, founder 
of the magazine. "There is a difference 
between just trying to get more black 
students writing, which is a sub-goal, 
and trying to establish a mechanism to 
talk 
about 
black 
issues, 
which 
is 
sornl·thing that no other publication 
should be expected to do." 

The issue of black representation re-
cently raised by Ritual and Dissent t>x-
tends to all areas of black life at Yale 
The question is, how can any predom-
inantly white organization treat black 
issues with the same integrity and depth 
as issues that are of more direct interest 
to whites? Jackson says it is the racism 
permeating all American society which 
"I don't feel that I should be carrying the 
burdens of the past around with me, 
because I think that m eans you're bringing 
them into the future." 
gives rise to institutions like the Afro-
American Cultural Center. "If we ac-
cept the fact that America has been a 
racist and segregated society for more of 
its history than not, then I think one has 
to look carefully at what happens when 
you suddenly introduce large numbers 
of formerly excluded people into an in-
stitution, people who have presumably 
some shared cultural background that is 
in some way distinct from the majority 

A service of the Black Church at the AAC C

~ group. Alice Walker said this about go-
~ ing to a white college: 'I found it im-
:t possible 
to go where my mother 
! couldn't come.' She was saying it 
~ metaphorically-'I'm not gonna go 
• alone and chop myself off from 
~ 
., everything else I've known.' The Center 
6 has been a support mechanism for black 
students and it has made sure that cer-
tain cultural activities unique to the 
Afro-American experitnce are present 
on campus for anyone who wants to en-
joy them.'' 

But if Jackson is worried about black 
students being expected to "chop" 
themselves ofT from their cultural pasts, 
others fear that they may be un-
necessarily excluding themselves from 
the activities of their white fellow 
students. Kim Westcott, a black Ezra 
Stiles sophomore from New York, ex-
plained that the reason she has not par-
ticipated much in AACC activities was 
that she fears cutting herself ofT from 
her wide circle of friends. "I feel that the 
Afro-Am Center is really good for 
security reasons: for feeling that you've 
got people who've experienced the same 
kinds of things. You'll know they can 
understand some things that other peo-


pie simply won't. But I also think it's 
easy to fall into a niche. You don't end 
up learning as much and "hitt•s don't 
end up learning as much about vou." 

Letitia Moore, born in the C~ntral 
American nation of Belize but raised in 
Los Angeles, offered other reasons for 
not attending Center activities. "Usual-
ly I don't feel comfortable in a group of 
black people who are espousing how 
black they are and rights for blacks and 
how we've been discriminated a~ainst." 
aid the black Calhoun sophomore. "I 
can relate to it on an intclkuual level. 
but I just don't feel like I've been 
discriminated against. I don't feel that I 
~hould be carrying the burdl·ns of the 
past around with me, because I think 
that means you're bringing it into the 
future. I guess as a result I just make a 
point not to hang around wuh them and 
not to be associated with bc.-ing black at 
Yale.

"I think part of it is because I am 
from Belize. I still have lots ofverv Beli-

have been put down and have suffered 
that I should dassify myself as a black 
person. The human race should stick 
together, shouldn't I><• broken down by 
colo•·." 

Some white <,tudents fear that organ-
izations like the Afro-American Cul-
tural Cemer promote a detrimental 
racial separatism, not by intent but by 
effect. J. B. Schramm. a white Stiles 
sophomore, attended a half-·white, half-
black Denver public -.chool and said 
that integration thc.·n· worked even on a 
social level. "You "ouldn't find a group 
of over five or six JX'ople gathered in the 
school where it wouldn't be interracial."

member, pastor of the Black Church at 
Yale, jazz saxophonist and music 
graduate student, defends the House 
against accusations that it ·promotes 
separatism. "The white students are 
more than welcome at the AACC. 
There's never been any kind of move to 
exclude them. What we've tried to do is 
to 
make 
sure 
the 
Afro-American 
heritage had a voice on campus, and 
that's not simply for the black students, 
but for the benefit of all. The same is 
true for the Black Church at Yale. We 
have white students who are members, 
we have white faculty members who 
come, white students who are in the 
choir. Those people have elected to 
come in and take seriously whatever the 
black spiritual and religious agenda is 
and J:>ecome a part of it." 
Ezra Stiles senior Kori King affirmed 
Andrews' views. "It never was the 
Center's purpose to serve as an instru-
ment of segregation," she said, "and 
there is no conspiracy to limit the ser-
vices of the Center to blacks. Only the 
individual is at fault for failing to seek 
out 211 Park Street." 
Through most of Yale's history, there 
were never more than one or two black 
students. In the late 1950s the college 
began to admit more black under-
graduates, but by 1964 there were still 
only 20 on campus. The class of 1968 
included 14 blacks, the class of '70 had 
33 and the class of '73 contained a 
record 96 black men and women. Many 
of those students 
weren't 
entirely 
satisfied withc_yv~at ,they found here. A 
historical paper at the AACC notes that 
blacks fQund campus mixers not to their 
liking and were even hassled by univer-
sity police who mistook them for un-
wanted townspeople. In the mid-sixties 
the Black Student Alliance at Yale 
formed to address such problems. Ac-
cording to Jackson, b lack students had 
four primary concerns: to monitor 
Yale's interaction with the New Haven 
community, increase the number of 
black students and faculty, insure that 
the curriculum reflected black history 
and culture, and promote student ac-
tivities that reflected their heritage. 
Working with President Kingman 
Brewster's receptive administration, 
black students lobbied to introduce the 
Afro-American Studies major in 1969 
and convinced the Corporation to 
charter the AACC, two gains which 
came without the violence and building 
seizures that occurred•at colleges like 
Cornell in the late sixties and early 
seventies.

"I think that this university has been 
extraordinarily careful to do what it can 
to meet the needs of its minority stu-
dents," said Jackson, "but I do think 
there are certain kinds of things in-
herent in being a white, male, elitist in-
stitution for 300 years that just can't be 
wiped out in 15 or 20. I don't think 
anybody means for these problems to be 
there. What you hear most from the 
black students are things that occur 
because of the reality of being a minori-
ty. For instance, if there are only 300 
black students, you better believe that 
there are a lot of people who are still the 
only black students in their classes. 
Slavery comes up and everybody looks 
at them! I still hear one story every year 
of the black person who gets into a room 
and the parent of a white roommate is 
there and says, 'Oh, you're my son's 
roommate?' I mean this really does hap-
pen. At least once a year I hear that." 
Black students also find themselves 
having to explain the more mundane 
characteristics of black 
culture 
curious whites. "There's always the 
weight of the things people don't know 
about," Jackson explained. "How you 
do your hair- the fascination with 
every little thing that you take for 
~ted. Sec. the thing about being 
black in America is vou know even:-
thing about what 
,~·hitc people do 
~cause it's everywhere. It's on TV. it's 
tn the magazines. The opposite is n()t 
true." 
The problems black students ex-
perience at Yale can sometimes be more 
"erious. "There are subtle things and 
there are not-so-subtle things," said 
Alexander. "Subtle things like, 'Oh, 
you're not really black You're preppv.' 
as if one cancels out the other. Or, 
'\Vhat do black people think about ... ?' 
Or, 'You just got in here because you're 
a black woman.' Now this is subtle. I'm 
quoting things that all have been said to 
me. Then when vou think of not-
so-subtle things . . . . There was a 
college seminar that I actually had to 
withdraw from because the teacher was 
very uncomfortable when I would write 
about 'black things.' Now that was very 
interesting tO me because I wasn't 
always \Hiting about C.'\plicitly black 
things. I was writing about me. A nd he 
threatened to kick me out of his class if I 
didn't stop \Hiting about 'black stufT.'"

cultural ground at Yale extends to the

the AACC, Ritual and Dissml, and the 
Black Church at Yale, which seek to 
maintain some of these things that Yale 
as an institution is not necessarily 
designed or fit to do." 

As 
the 
Afro-American Cultural 
Center enters its fifteenth year these 
questions of black identity and the best 
means of remedying the problems of 
racism will continue to be debated. 
"Racial progress presumes that all the 
parties involved will have to acknowledge
the fact that racism still is an 
issue," said Andrews. "Much of our 
community would like to think that 
is no longer true, and that denial in a 
sense impedes any kind of progress. I 
think the more the white students transcend
themselves and look at other 
peoples' concerns and issues, the more 
progress will be made. It is possible, I'm 
sure of that, because we've already seen 
it in reverse. There are black students 
here who know Sartre and Camus and 
all of these guys as well as anybody else. 
I mean, this is part of our culture. This 
is part of the dominant culture. We 
learn the languages. Now this must 
happen in reverse. You see it's very in-
teresting from the standpoint of what a 
black American might say to Camus, 
given the black American's status in this 
country. It's also very important that 
the white American look at those 
aspects of Afro-American culture which 
have their own validity and standing, 
that he might bring to bear whatever he 
might have to say about it. But first of 
all you must do what the black students 
have had to do by necessity, which is to 
transcend their own station. That's very 
important."

"I am not an activist, I am an in-
dividualist. But the quality of my life 
went up the day I joined.".Jane Krieger 
did not vote for a union when she was 
first offered a 
ballot in 
1977. "I 
associated unions with truck drivers and 
men smoking cigars," said Krieger, an 
employee of the British Art Center. 
Four years later she had changed jobs 
four times. Each change, billed as a 
promotion, brought with it the same 
salary classification. Feeling trapped in 
a dead-end situation, Kreiger saw two 
alternatives: accept the status quo, or 
leave. Her voice rims with intensity as 
she states, "Joining the union gave me a 
whole new set of options, ways to 
change my situation." 

For Kneger and other active mem-
bers of Local 34, the Federation of 
University Employees, the events of the 
past few weeks have been an all-absorbing 
preoccupation. the culmination of four 
years of work. Other workers feel the

union's presence has brought only 
dissension and division. The decision 
whether or not to join Yale's newest 
union forced many to rethink their at-
titudes about their jobs, their careers 
and their roles in the University com-
munity. Behind the strike publicity the 
union has quietly brought about many 
changes in the lives of Yale's clerical and 
technical workers. 

Krieger's pro-union shift was not uni-
que among Local 34 members. At-
tempts to organize a clerical union 
failed in 1968, 1971 and 1977, although 
each time by a smaller margin. John 
Wilhelm, chief negotiator for Local 34, 
interprets the success of this union as 
the reflection of larger national trends. 
"As our economy shifts more and more 
towards services and away from heavy 
industry," he said, "I think the labor 
movement will have to shift with it." 

However, these service or "pink col-
lar" jobs are usually held by women who 
are new to organized labor. Susie 
Eyzaguirre, a clerical worker in the 
Medical School, explains, "We've always 
been 
'professionals.' We 
bought 
business suits and went to night school. 
And there's this traditional 
prejudice 
against 'professionals' organizing." 

Eyzaguirre came to Yale from Barnard 
as the wife of a graduate student and 
began working part-time. Now a di-
vorced mother of two, she says, "I kept 
thinking I was going on to do I don't 
know what. But at some point I guess I 
grew up. I thought, if I don't take my 
job seriously now, when will I?" She 
joined the union and became a member 
of the negotiating committee. 

Like Eyzaguirre, many women in 
Yale's new union are slowly coming to 
the realization that their "temporary" 
jobs are not going away. The union has 
given these women a forum for their 
ideas about on-the-job training pro-
grams, day care for their children and 
salary raises. It gives them control over 
their careers to an extent not possible 
before. Eyzaguirre smiles. "I don't 
mean to wax poetic about all this 'com-
munity' stuff, but this union has given 
women I know the courage to stand up 
for themselves, to say 'I'm important' in 
a way they never could before." She 
pauses. "When I joined, I met all of 
these terrific people, doing interesting 
jobs all over Yale, and affecting the Yale 
community in important ways, none of 
whom I ever knew existed before." 

For its members, union meetings 
have served as the basis for a whole new 
network of friends and associates. 
Eyzaguirre laughs. "The University 
probably should negotiate to keep us on 
campus. They have no idea how much 
better things run." Krieger points to 
some subtler advantages. "Now, if you 
want to know something, say about a 
job transfer, you know who to call. It 
wasn't that we weren't trying to get 
ahead at Yale before the union, it was 
that we had to do it alone. There was 
this feeling that you could make it at 
Yale, but only if you looked out for your 
own interests." 

Local 35, the dining hall and 
maintenance union, has for the past 
decade shown Yale's clericals what a 
union can achieve. With a 
tight 
organization and a series of very effec-
tive strikes, they have gained salaries 
and benefits superior to those of the 
clericals. To Eyzaguirre the connection 
was obvious. "It wasn't that Yale valued 
its truck drivers and dishwashers more 
than its secretaries and librarians, it's 
just that the truck drivers had a voice, 
but the secretaries didn't." 

Sitting in her office on Ashmun Street, 
Lisa Huck is on the other side of the 
campus and on the other side of the 
union controversy from Eyzaguirre and 
Krieger, but she speaks with equal con-
viction. "Unions take away initiative 
and drive," she said, "and are not con-
ducive to a working atmosphere, which 
some people seem to forget is what this 
is supposed to be." Huck, a former Yale 
Divinity School student, now a com-
puter operator 
in 
purchasing 
department, 
becomes increasingly 
"I don't mind paying fifteen dollars a month 
to get the union off my back."

agitated as she lists incidents of union-
inspired antagonism. Huck claims to 
have overheard personal abuse directed 
at non-union members, has seen papers 
overturned and moved on co-workers' 
desks, and recounts that co-worker Ann 
Fiore received a package of dead fish in 
the mail. Along with Fiore, she recently 
formed a group of anti-union clerical 
and technical workers (C&T-), an 
organization she says will continue, 
although the threat of an imminent 
strike has disappeared. She explains, "It 
can be very isolating to feel like you're 
the only one who doesn't buy the union 
line, who likes her job at Yale." Huck, 
Fiore 
and 
the 
approximately 400 
workers they represent see the union's 
success as the result of coercion and 
"strong-arm" tactics, not communal ef-
fort. 

However, 
union 
proponents attribute its success in overcoming tradi-
tional stereotypes to its unique organizing 
methods. Like most unions Local 34 
began with a small group of 30 "charter 
members," led by a representative from 
the International. From there, instead 
of immediately trying to get a quorum 
for an election, the group decided to 
develop a real grassroots base and to 
educate employees about the issues. 
This meant a lot of talking-or "arm-
twisting," according to Lisa Huck. Ann 
Brocker, 
one 
of the union's paid 
organizers, simply shrugs off such ac-
cusations. "The premise behind the 
drive was that if someone wanted to 
stick her head in the sand, we wanted to 
pull it out and tell her to listen." 

Organizing from the inside also 
meant employing organizers who knew 
the Yale community. Local 35, Yale's 
dining hall union, was already here, 
and its organizers, including Wilhelm, 
were crucial in getting Local 34 off the 
ground. Brocker, a 1977 graduate, ex-
emplifies the kind of person involved. 
She first worked in a union while she


was a student, and since then has had 
various kinds of organizing experience. 
She explains, "my job is to organize 
myself out of a job. The people in the 
offices have really done the work 
themselves. We've made a commitment 
to talk to every worker, so that everyone 
has a part to play." 

Once a 
final contract has been 
signed, none of the International's 
organizers plan to work at Yale. In-
stead, the leadership positions will all be 
filled by union members. Spokeswoman 
Krieger explains, "We will never 
stop organizing, because with every 
change in the workplace, our union has 
to change too. A union has to be what 
its workers want it to be." She remembers 
that in 1977, "I bought the whole 
thing-'Yale is your family' and all of 
that. I didn't realize that a union could 
also be a democracy." The "grassroots" 
organizing tactics slowly 
changed 
Krieger's and others' opinions. 

Democracy did become a very im-
portant issue for many members when 
the decision was made not to strike. 
Some left the vote early, threatening to 
resign, claiming the union capitulated 
under pressure. Wilhelm believes dis-
satisfaction comes from workers who 
are unfamiliar with the contract, which 
as far as he knows is the only one of its 
kind. Although it does not raise salaries, 
it institutes grievance procedures which 
will allow workers to have their job clas-
sifications changed and their salary 
classifications raised without impossible 
paperwork. It also guarantees job se-
curity if a clerical is fired because of 
funding cuts or department reorganiz-
ation. 

Finally, the interim contract does not 
contain a no-strike clause. "This con-
tract is extremely unusual," says Wil-
helm. "I don't know of any others like it. 
I'm just tickled at the tactical oppor-
tunities it opens up," alluding to the 
possibility of a short strike. Eyzaguirre 
points to the positive side of the dissen-
sion within the union. "There's a lot of 
energy out there, and it can be chan-
neled. People were ready to strike. 
Believe me, if no contract has been 
signed by graduation, you'll hear from

has a few minutes in the afternoon to sit 
at her kitchen table and recall some of 
the frustrations of union bargaining. 

One night she was forced to choose be-
tween a negotiating session and a long-
standing promise to take her children to 
the Icc Capades. She chose the Ice 
Capades. Negotiations had been taking 
place during the afternoons, time she 
usually spends with her children. "It 
was only fair," she says. 

She laughs. "Here's what happens. 
We sit down. They sit down. They 
usually 
talk 
first. 
They 
propose 
something. They go into another room, 
we talk about it. They come back and 
listen to what we have to say, and then 
their lawyer runs over to 451 College 
Street (the Yale Administration Offices) 
to ask the big boy<; what to do. We 
wait." Eyzaguirre lights a Marlboro. "I 
would call the process cumbersome. I 
also think there is something inherently 
wron~ with proxy negotiations. It seems 
to me that they might understand us 
better if we spoke face to face." 

In general, Eyzaguirre claims to be 
satisfied with the gains made so far. "I 
think we're all 
feeling a 
bit let 
down-actually, I think my children 
were the sorriest that there was no 
strike. They thought they might see me 
more often if I didn't have to go to 
work." Now that negotiations will be 
taking place during work hours, she 
hopes the pace will slow down. "Mom-
my's getting boring," pipes up her 
daughter Claudia. "All she talks about is 
the union." 

Eyzaguirre has to leave. Claudia is 
going with her to Steering Committee. 
As she puts on a raincoat, she relates 
one last anecdote. "Two days ago, after 
we signed the interim contract, a doctor 
who used to work at Yale came into the 
office. I don't think he was pro- or anti-
union or anything. He asked a few 
questions, looked around, and said, 
'Hmmm ... the University had to sign 
a comract with the clerical union.' I 
don't know- to me, that somehow 
summed it up. We're here now."

Patrick Eaglin has been instruning 
and inspiring students of Shoto· Kan 
Karate at Yale since he founded the pro-
gram in September of 1982. The class is

Eaglin, 40, took up the art 17 years 
ago when he saw a demonstration grven 
by a fourth degree black belt. "The 
serenity that came from that man was 
phenomenal," he recalls. "It was the 
~auty of it that got me." What followed 
m Eaglin's training was not always 
beautiful or serene, but always intt·nse. 
While teaching classes and training 
under Kazumi Tabata, 
the grand 
master of Shoto-Kan Karate, Eaglin 
PU~"'<m·d his studies. He received a Ph.D. 
from Harvard, V~.ent on to be a pro-
fessor of English at Michigan State and 
then entered Yale Law School. This 
spring he will complete his studies and 
exams, and will join a Ia"' firm in Col-
orado. Leaving the program he has 
begun and the students he has in-
structt•d

and 10 those \'\ho practice the art it is 
just that. Then· is a spirit in the art that 
becomes ins<.'parable from the martial 
artist. "In 
the 
Wt•st 
they call 
it 
charisma." says Eaglin. It is invisible 
control, power; it is what he has spent 
years cultivating in himself. 

Eaglin has a power and a presence 
that is gripping. In room EF he starts 
thl' count with an unintelligible cry. 
Everyone knoV~.s that it means "one." A 
<;in~l~. drivin~ '>yllablt• marks c·very mo-
tion that follows. It is the force and the 
un~ing behind the count, not the count 
itself that matter.,. 

Riccardo 
Fre~gi, a brown belt in 
Morse, is one of thost• student<; inspired 
by Eaglin's intensity. "I saw this huge 
crazy black man," says Frcggi, rccaJiing 
his fir·st impression of Eaglin. "H e was

yelling and I said to myself 'this guy's 
crazy'-but I stayed." Frc·~~i. v.·ho has

I would ~ct hurt. Then Sensei would

would say. 'pain good, Patrick, pain 
good.' And at some point I accepted it." 

The· nec·d to physicalize intense emo-
tions is what initiallr draws many peo-
ple to karate and the other martial arts. 
"People who become fighters have 
urwesolved life anger- they arc· people 
who can ckal with pain.'' says Eaglin. "I 
like being hit-not in the masochi'lti<

Eaglin. For him there was no sq>ara-
tion between what happened in tlw do 
jo and what happent·d in tht· outsidt• 
world. He had always pern·ivt·d himsl'lf 
as a gentle man, yet he was living in a 
world of total violem:c. He dropp<•d out 
of the art. H e had been teaching at the 
YMCA in Cambridge. "I walkt·d 10 the 
Y and tOld my students that I quit," he 
says. "I told them that karatt' is neither 
good nor bad. but simply what you 
choose to do." 
Eaglin felt diffused- he wasn't train-
ing- he didn't have a center. There was 
a void in his life. "Trainin~ scoops it all 
up and says 'straight down that road,"' 
"I am seeking to 
perform th e perfect 
act. " 
he says. "There is an ugly fet'lin~ that 
comes from people. who think tht•y're in 
an art to hurt people." After much 
thought, he returned to the art. Now, 
he says, "The sparring is n:duced. I'm 
more interested in perfection of form 
and moving into different states of 
mind." 

M editation is an important part of 
karate. Zen. "M y perception is that the 
'spirit' in the mystical sense is tht· soun·c 
of all things," says Eaglin. The st>nse of 
spirit relies on 
the 
disc-ipline and 
maturity of the martial artist. One must 
get rid of the excitement to practice: the 
art requires control. It is not a physi<·al 
vent for frustrations. "You have to be 
able to act without emotion,,~ ht• savs. 
'"If you are acting in a deta<:hed fa,hion.

are stern and cool. In turn Eaglin 
moves i:>ehind each of them and touches 
his finger to a spot on their backs "Get 
power out of my fingertips," he says. 
The sound of breathing builds. The 
room sounds windswept; it seems va-
cant. "Okay, your hips should be lifting 
as you push." The rhythm of his words 
matches the slow motion of punches 
analyzed through practice. H e guides 
them into a karate-do state of mind. 
"This is not a muscle exercise. When 
you're doing it slow, your mind carries 
it through." His voice ascends to 
another register. It could be speaking 
from above the skylights. "Make your 
punches feel like they're going through 
me. Touch me."

and H bdicver in miracles, is clearly one

can be filled with love. If people grow, 
the cancer doesn't. When patients 
become new people, they don't need the 
old illness." 

H is healing practice is based on lessons 
learned from his parents. From his 
mother, he learned the power of love 
and the will to live: "She was hyper-
thyroid, weighed ninety pounds, and 
was told that if she became pregnant, 
she would most likely die. She found an

a couch for three months until she 
t:{ained the weight. Then she became 
pregnant, had me, and the hyper-
thyroidism disappeared. The message I 
got from that was, 'You can't do 
anything wrong. Your mother's well 
and here you are. You're a gift."' 
From his father he learned the ac-
ceptance of death: "At age 90 plus, my 
father's grandfather told everyone that 
he was going to die that night, and to 
get his friends and a boule of schnapps. 
Of course they humored him. He had 
his party and afterwards went upstairs 
and lay down and died." 
Both his parents are still alive. "I'm 
still somebody's child. That's very im-
portant. It allows me to do a lot of 
things, as a child." 

Graduating from Cornell Medical Col-
ege in 1957 and setting up a surgical 
pra~tice in New H aven, he found it dif-
ficult to harmonize his parents' legacy 
with his new role. "I wasn't trained to 
see m y patients as people. I saw them as 
rlisease, as machines I had to repair. I 
started having a conflict over the life-
saving image. I had to take care of peo-
ple who were d ying, but most of the 
physicians 
who were 
my teachers 
couldn't handle it." They dealt with 
death by denial and a belief in their own 
invulnerability. A nd that's a reason they 
don't often worry about preventive 
medicine. 
"I felt I had to make myself vulner-
able, and begin to learn from my pa-
tients. I redefined my roles. I became at 
different times a healer, teacher, care-
giver or student. My relationship with 
my patients became one of shared re-
sponsibility. People whose lives were 
threatened were able to teach me the 
how and why of living." 

Siegel, an associate professor at the 
medical school,_ decided to set up a 
mutual support group for cancer pa-
tients after attending a 1978 workshop 
on "Psychological Factors, Stress and 
Cancer," which explored the usc of 
meditation and visualization as tools for 
healing cancer. On the first day there 
was;mexercise in which each participant 
was supposed to meet an inner guide. 
"I went into the experience with a 
very negative attitude: I will not meet 
anybody, nothing will appear, noth-
ing's going to happen. Then I thought, 
well, since I'm a surgeon, who else 
would dare appear in my head but Jesus 
or 
Moses? And then along came

George-my inner guide with a beard 
and a \\.hite gown, This was an incredi-
ble experience because I never thought 
it would happen. I found I could talk to 
George and get very honest answers, 
some of \\.hich I didn't neccssaril>· like." 
The power of this and other mental 
exercises impres<.ed him. He asked 
George if he should go back to school 
and become a psvchiatrist. "He told me, 
'Don't forgt.·t, Sit·gcl, you're a little vain. 
You don't want to giv<.· up something 
you're good at. And you can open doors 
being in a hospital, do things like death 
and dying counseling, talking with pa-
tients, kissing them. hugging them.' 
"So I remained a surgeon."


He started reading enormous amounts, 
especially Carljung. H e learned to use 
dreams to diagnose physical illness and 
illustrate the mind's awareness of the 
body. He was astounded b}' the preci-
sion of those diagno. es. One of his 
young patients dreamt that his teddy 
bear was on crutches and had one leg 
missing. 1-i'e woke up and told his 
brother: "M y leg has cancer, but don't 
tell mommy." A year later his leg had to 
be amputated above the knee. 
A woman dreamt that the top of her 
head was shaved. and on her scalp was 
the word "CANCER" in b i<Xk letters. 
There were no svmptoms to show her 
doctor, so she stayed at home, waiting, 
until the pain began. 
Dr. 
Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, 
the 
author of On Death and Dying, taught 
him a drawing technique that also adds 
to the overall diagnosis. The method 
assigns certain meanings to colors and 
the placement of images on the page. 
Siegel would have his patients draw pic-
tures of themselves and their suspected 
illnesses, then review them after the pa-
tients became ill and try to map the cor-
respondences. 
He notes, "The drawings allowed me 
to deal with symbols that were truer and 
more revealing than spoken language. 
As a surgeon, having both the minds 
and bodies to work with, I was able to 
train myself. I am now able to predict 
future events based upon unconscious 
beliefs and attitudes."


He has the energy of a man who gets 
the governor's pardon moments before 
they strap him into the chair. Bernie 
Siegel is ionized almost beyond belief. 
His is not nervous energy; he has no 
trouble sitting stilL His words are rapid-
fire, his gestures sharp and sweeping. 
He gives off the glow of the born-again. 
His mission is wide-ranging: surgery 
and sermon , probing with scalpel and 
scythe. His medical practice encom-
passes end-stage care, 
preventive 
strategies and 
mental 
heahh. 
His 
spiritual practice draws on all of the<.e 
and more. H e says he feel 
mo t at 
home in a church or temple. He sull 
finds time to consult George and u e 
his advice. H e does so many thing . but 
shows no outward signs of doubt. ;\lone 
at all.

faith in a particular therapy can deter-
mine ih sun css. Siegel uses the draw-
ings to divim· his patients' attitudes. 
"If JX'ople draw their cht·motherapy 
as a bum h of arrowo;. but not one single 
arrow poiming to their cancer, then you 
kno'' that their unnmo;cious is sayinlt, 
'This \tuft is totally int>fTcctive and it

consc.·iously."


.. 1 don't l{t'l depressed bec.·ause I don't do 
rhin~ts to patic.·nts anymore. If you come 
10 me as a patient and <>ay, 'Help me get 
well,' I 'iay, 'Thc.•sc.• are the ways I can 
44 Tht• ;-., ..... Juurn.ti/April 20. 1984 
help,' and if you say that's accc.·prable, 
then \'lle're a team. We do it togetht·r. 
We operate, and you wake up and f(:d 
great, and I walk out f<.·ding great 
because we're a ream. The kl·y is shar-
ing. T hat's how I save my life."


H e repeats a favorite quotation from 
Albert Schweitzer's writings: "It's sup-
posed to be a professional secret, but I'll 
tell you anyway. 
We doctors do 
nothing. We only help and encourage 
the doctor within."


Siegel sent out a letter 10 about one 
hundred cancer patients, telling thc.·rn 
he had discovered something whic·h 
could probably improve the quality and 
extent of their lives. H e expc.•ctcd at 
least 
five 
hundred 
replies 
and 
wondered how he'd scat them all. H~ 
got twelve respono;es. 
"This was when I began to under-
stand that nor all patients want to g<>t 
well. It made me really begin to wonder 
what we as physicians arc doing."


~About fifteen to twenty percent of peo-
ple who arc seriously ill would prefer to 
die: if given the opportunity. F ifty to six-
ty percent of patients are willing to get 
better as long as the doctor does the 
work and the medicine doesn't taste too 
bad. The final fifteen to twenty percent 
sa)', 'I'll do anything I have to do to get 
well. Just show me."' 
People from the last group came to 
form Exceptional Cancer Patients. He 
slows his voice to add weight to his 
words: "When I be~an to meet these 
people, it was the beginning of my edu-
cation. They began to teach me what 
people who want to live have to do. 
\\'hen you spend time with people who 
literally could die tomorro'" but go on 
living, you begin to learn why they're 
waking up each day.-


He explains the four questions he asks 
each or his exceptional cancer patients: 
Do you want to live to be I 00 years 
old? 
.. A positive response says I am in con-
trol of my life and enjoy it. I do not fear 


the futurt' and I have a will to live. ln an 
audience made up of physicians, fewer 
than five percent will respond positive-
ly." 
What has happened in you•· life in the 
year or two prior to the illness? 
"I do not believe that it is a coin-
cidence when a m~jor illness strikes an 
individual. Some examples: an in-
dividual having a desultory love affair 
may develop cancer of the cervix or 
uterus. A mother losing a child may 
well develop cancer of the breast." 
What does the diagnosis mean to 
you? . 
"Doctors must deal with negative ex-
pectations, theirs and the patient's. 
Since they do not know the future, they 
must give the patient the chance to be 
the exception. Statistics can kill, emo-
tions can make you well." 
Why do you need this illness? 
"Sometimes it provides the patients 
with benefits that can be achieved 
through more positive means-atten-
tion, love ,control- the possibilities are 
limitless. One patient of mine entered 
the hospital after her remission from-
cancer 
for other 
reasons, 
simply 
because she had no one to tell her 
triumph to at home."


On love: 
"Love is the most powerful immune 
stimulant in the body. Not only that, it 
feels good."


Last year a woman came to him and 
said, "I want God to heal me. But I 
want you to monitor it." "I'm very 
unassuming," he notes, "so as a surgeon 
I don't mind monitoring God's work. 
"I'm a believer, I'm open. I see 
things. I believe in the concept of a 
God, as the primal force, as the begin-
ning of our collective unconscious, what 
have you. I'd be willing to label those 
things God. And when I meditate, I 
open myself up to God's presence, to his 
message, in order to do his work. Our 
work, actually."

O ne year after he shaved his head, 
Siegel used the drawing technique to 
find out why. He drew himself with a 
rainbow-colored 
bird on his right 
shoulder and George counseling him at 
his left. T here was a pond with a fish 
out of water, and mountains whose tops 
were filled in with white crayon. 
K ubler-Ross helped him interpret it. 
T he first thing she asked was "What 
are you hiding? You don't need white 
crayon on white paper." Combining 
this clue with the fish symbol, he real-
ized that he had been hiding his love 
and spirituality, because of the way he 
was taught to practice medicine. And he 
realized that all along he had been get-
ting messages in his meditations to un-
cover something. H e had taken that 
message literally and shaved his head. 

19 
On his office desk are a few AN-
TIC IPATE 
M IRACLES bumper 
stickers and a "Bald is Beautiful" mirror 
stand with a fat baby figurine inserted 
in to its wooden base. He wears a rain-
bow "Bernie" button and belt buckle.

"Elizabeth told me"- he imitates 
Kubler-Ross' Swiss accent-"'that the 
spirits, the healing spirits, need a lot of 
energy to materialize, and music pro-
vides that energy.' She likes Hank 
W illiams, so in the operating room I 
play Williams, Willie Nelson, baroque 
music, 'Amazing Grace,' a lot of things. 
I realized what a powerful effect the 
music had on the O.R. when I forgot 
my tapes one day. Everyone missed it, 
especially the nurses. One of my 
associates, Richard Selzer, a surgeon 
and writer, made me realize that when 
they took the windows out of the 
operating room, they took out God. I 
want to bring God back in." 

21 
"Years ago, I was giving a speech and 
found myself torn between my planned 
outline and the unplanned things that 
were coming out of my mouth thanks to 
who-knows-what. I fmally decided that 
'the other guy' was doing a better job 
and I let go of the outline and let him 
give the speech." He spoke for 90 
minutes without notes. "Afterwards, a 
woman came up to me and said that 
she'd heard me speak before, but I had 
never been this inspirational. Another 
woman stood before me and said 'I'm a 
medium, and in the middle of your 
speech, this figure appeared before the 
podium. I drew a sketch of him for you.' 
I looked at the paper and cried out, 'My 
God, it's George!'" 

22 
Possible epitaph: "You don't have to be 
afraid of living. Because you can stop 
when you want to." 
' 

23 
This is one of his favorite stories: "Son-
ny, one of my exceptional patients, 
went to Hospice to die. Surrounded by 
love, she didn't die. After many months 
Sonny's husband asked how to help his 
wife. I told him, 'You have to tell her 
that you and the boys love her and will 
be okay and she can go if she wants to.' 
He told her Wednesday morning while 
shifting her breakfast tray. Wherr he 
turned to look back at her, she had 
gone. Later that day, I was praying for 
her in the hospital chapel. A plaque on 
the wall began to shake. and being the 
scientist that I am, I looked at it dispas-
sionately. The plaque read, 'In the 
midst of life, I am with you.' It was Son-
ny's way of saying goodbye." 

24 
He recently spoke at the annual con-
vention of the American Medical Stu-
dent Association. "Think of what I 
could do to the practice of medicine if 
every year I talked to 1000 students! 
I've converted a lot of people in New 
Haven already." 

25 
"It hurts me to know that everyone is 
not living the way I know they can live. 
I see people who won't listen to their in-
ner needs, including my own family. 
When I feel or sense conflict, I lzaue the 
answer. But many people just don't 
want it."

ediwr of the Yale Daily News Magazine.
