EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
If you have a key or a friend with one, 
you can come for tea in the very old 
Clubhouse at 459 College Street. A key 
is $1.50. Lifetime membership is $10, if 
you have friends with keys who will 
write kind letters about your ability to 
participate in "free and unaffected 
discussion." Over tea and sandwiches 
from four to six, members of the Lizzie 
talk about literature and the finer things 
in life. And their theses and their novels 
and their trips to England. And philosophy. And the sandwiches, which vary 
from cucumber to peanut butter and 
jelly.


Roger Pardo-Maurer, Branford '84, 
is sketching archangels on a blank post-
card back in the tea room. He laughs at 
the result. They are pulling a bedraggled 
man out of an ocean. He writes a 
caption beneath them in an awkward, 
childish scrawl. "It's from the 34th 
psalm," he says in his Costa Rican ac-
cent. "But I found it on a bridge while I 
was traveling this summer in Czecho-
slovakia. It sounds much better in Ger-
man." He demonstrates. His favorite 
poems are Rilke's Duino Elegies. He is 
memorizing them in the original Ger-
man. It wouldn't be worth his while to 
do it in English, he says. "I think we 
should have ostrich egg and seaweed 
sandwiches instead of those!" He points 
to the linen-draped table with its tea-
service, Pepperidge Farm cookies, and 
deviled ham sandwiches, which he 
dislikes. 

The living room, the first on the 
right, is painted a chalky forest green. 
The table lamp lights the stacks of 
Punch, London News and Country Life 
magazines, and the picture of Alex-
ander Pope, a lovely portrait, the front-
ispiece for many fine editions. The 
elderly man in the leather chair beneath 
it looks like Pope, except his hair is 
greyer and he has fewer wrinkles. He 
very well may have lived his entire life 
indoors. 

"Look at this, isn't it beautiful?" He 
points to a picture of a sixteenth-
century Tudor mansion in the issue of 
Country Life he is reading. "And only 
Â£80,000." He doesn't pause to calculate. 
"That's only $120,000 for a lovely 
manor house in the country. You've 
been over, of course?" He has crossed 
the Atlantic forty times. His eyebrows 
are long and grizzled. 

The vault is open only on Fridays. If 
you leave your tea, cookies and pipes 
outside, you can browse among price-
less first editions of Paradise Lost, rare 


Shakespearian folios and a 1558 copy of 
The Quenes Maiesties Passage through the 
Citie of London to Westminster the Daye 
before Her Coronation. But today is Sun-
day and you must satisfy yourself with 
The Quenes Maiesties portraits in the 
tea room. 

There is a knock at the door. Someone 
has forgotten his key. Matthew 
Lopes answers. He wears a mustard 
waiter's coat several shades lighter than 
his skin. He takes small steps and has 
served the Lizzie for over 25 years. 
"Hello, hello," he says to Elizabeth Ar-
chibald, a graduate student, who likes 
the Lizzie's food and fellowship so much 
that she once gave up the Club for 
Lent. Matthew goes back to the kit-
chen, where he keeps a short-legged, 
long-haired 
dog 
that 
growls at 
everyone. 

Dan Duffy '83, according to one 
member of the Club, has the face of a 
macho cherub, a perfect face with green 
eyes. He also laughs extremely loudly at 
public poetry readings. He directs a 
series of them at Timothy Dwight Col-
lege and is starting a press to publish 
New Haven poets. Dan Duffy can write 
a page in his head and see it all at once. 
"I can tell . . . where the words repeat 
... and how they look ... in relation 
to each other," he says in between long 
exhalations of pipe smoke. "It's kind of 
like ... the electric signs they have in 
Times Square. You know ... the kind 
where the words come out ... all in a 
line ... in letters made of green dots? 
... That's how I see my thoughts ... 
when I write." 

No one interrupts Dan Duffy. No 
one's ever sure when he's done talking. 
His pauses are profound and thought-
ful. It would be terrible to interrupt 
those strings of green dots. 

The vault room is sunny. King Lui 
Wu, vice-president of the Elizabethan 
Club, sits by the window. He teaches a 
course entitled "Daylight and Architec-
ture." "When I design a building I want 
it to be human- to be concerned with 
people," he says. "I design modern 
buildings but I build with the view of 
the past and the future, from the 
substance of the past, and though you 
can't see any of the past in it, it is in 
there." 

Wu likes to study philosophy and 
poetry, disciplines he likes because they 
also build on tradition. "I urge my 
students to read poetry," he says. "It 
humanizes them and their architec-
ture." Wu writes verse of his own. He 
looks aside and leans his head back. "I 
write in Chinese, I do not think my ... 
command of English is good enough to 
write English verse," he says, smiling. "I 
only show it to a very few friends who 
speak Chinese. There are two ways of 
creating art, the analytical way which is 
more with your head, and then the in-
tuitive way, with your heart. I get more 
pleasure from the creative way, and 
here we are lucky in an academic set-
ting to just be able to enjoy it." 

"What's going on in the kitchen?" 
Tim Cone, a law student, is upset. He 
brandishes his deviled ham sandwich at 
Elizabeth Archibald. "It's Sunday, isn't 
it? Why isn't this date nut and cream 
cheese?" Elizabeth Archibald does not 
know. Maybe Matthew would. "Well 
I'm not sure if cream cheese and date 
nut made sense with Sundays, or if 
Sundays made sense with cream cheese 
and date nut," Tim Cone explains to 
anyone who will listen, "but you can imagine my profound dismay when I bit 
into this!" Tim Cone is going to be a 
corporate lawyer. He makes significant 
eye contact. Rumor has it that he made 
an innocent Newsie kiss him before he 
would tell her where Matthew keeps the 
teabags for the Lizzie's brew. Matthew 
doesn't use teabags. 

Matthew takes empty tea cups off the 
tables in the vault room. How are you? 
"Oh fine, fine." His voice is deep but 
wavering. This place is always pretty 
busy, yes? "Oh yes, yes." 

What have 
you been up to, Matthew? "Oh, the 
same old thing. And you?" The answer 
is always much longer. 

King Lui Wu loves poetry because it 
is so precise. "With just a few words you 
can capture what in a novel would take 
up perhaps four pages," he says. He 
studied poetry in China, where he grew 
up. After studying English there for a 
summer, he enrolled in Yale. "My tutor 
wanted me to go to England, but the 
war in Europe was approaching then 
and my father thought it would be bet-
ter to go the United States. But I tra-
veled to England later, seven or eight 
times. And to Italy too. There are many 
beautiful architectural styles there." He 
smiles. "The Pantheon has one tiny hole 
in the ceiling, one very small hole, and 
it is only about 4 percent of the area of 
the floor, but it lets in a beautifully dif-
fuse light, like old wine, instead of 
whiskey. 

"I've designed everything from a 
house to a bank to a church. In China, 
now they have different ideas, so it is a 
very different challenge to build there. 
When I designed a church in New Ha-
ven I had to learn about the religion." 

He gets up to leave. The sun has left the 
vault room. 

"I think the best profession in law is 
that of a tax lawyer," says Tim Cone. 
"You see, when you reach my stage in 
life (and you will) you'll find yourself 
looking for that special person." Tim 
Cone makes significant eye contact. "A 
tax lawyer spends all of his time finding 
shelters. A woman loves a shelter. A 
corporate lawyer settles down in a posi-
tion of financial security that women 
admire." (Meaningful glance.) "As I 
said, my views aren't terribly compati-
ble with feminism. But after I'm settled 
down and married, then I can go into 
public advocacy and that sort of thing." 

The old grandfather clock in the liv-
ing room strikes six. Matthew turns off 
some lights in the tea room. The old 
man who looks like Pope hopes the 
sandwiches will be date nut and cream 
cheese next Sunday, but he says this 
quietly, so as not to offend Matthew. 
Dan Duffy is going to hear one of his 
friends, "the sensitive poet," read new 
work over old tobacco. Tim Cone must 
leave now; he is meeting someone for 
dinner. Soon Matthew is left alone with 
the Shakespearian folios and the dog 
that growls. And a plate full of deviled 
ham sandwiches.
