"We get 100 letters a week," Donald 
said, the heavy steel chains on his wrist 
jingling as he shook an impressive 
three-inch thick packet. "People write in 
from all over to ask about CCND," he 
explained. "They ask how to start a 
chapter, how to introduce their children 
to the issue of nuclear arms or what the 
group is doing." 
Some people send in donations, 
others write 
to 
cntlc1ze, 
accusing 
CCND of being a Communist organiz-
ation. The group does not worry about 
the people who already oppose disarma-
ment. "You can't get through to them," 
said Karen. "Even if you do there is no 
way of knowing; it is like working 
against a concrete wall. You can only 
convince the ones· you can talk to. The 
kids arc hearing." 

One of CCND's most successful ac-
tivities has been class presentations on 
the topic of nuclear arms. "It was 
strange to find out how many people 
didn't know about what was going on 
and how much we could teach them," 
said Karen. The fifth-, sixth-
and 
seventh-grade audiences they address 
are usually completely uninformed. 
Few know that nuclear weapons have

ever been used, much less that the 
bombs were dropped by the United 
States. Generally working in pairs, 
members go through the 
11-page 
CCND pamphlet explaining the history 
and use of nuclear weapons from the 
first use on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to 
the modern arms race and peace move-
ment. Each has his own approach. "If 
you can find someone who is pro-nuke, 
the best way to get into it is by arguing 
enthusiastically. "We don't try to scaJt 
them, and I think we succeed in nol 
scaring them. We give them the fa<.15 
and we don't really force an opinion: \It 
simply say this is the state of things and 
this is what you can do," said Donald. 
Sara, who became a CCND member 
just this year, confirmed the influence 
of CCND's talks. "I was in a class last 
year, and you guys came and talked, 
and I know that all through lunch and

with them about it, and then you can 
bring up points," said Josh. 

Their talks have a strong effect. "At 
the beginning of class you come in on a 
bunch of sixth graders all babbling at 
the top of their mouths. They don't pay 
any attention to you, but 15 minutes 
later they are all sort of staring at you, 
you know, and by the end of the class 
they have so many questions that it's 
impossible for you to leave," said jessica 
all through the next day everyone ~·~ 
like, 'Wow did you hear those k1dsj 
They sure know a lot about it. Maybe 
should get involved.' It did start to rnaJ<e 
people think about it." 

The students learn more than histon· 
from CCND's presentations. "It is io· 
teresting to them because they arc 
scared, and they see that as kids we arc 
talking to them and we know whll1 
is happening," said Karen. "rm sure '


t of them realize that there are other 
roups made up of adults. They don't 
alizc that they have a voice and can 
se i1. The kids are not ignorant, but 
hey art• surprised that they can have an 
mpan." 

itting in her living room on a quiet 
estvillc side street, Karen seems more 
ike an average, even conservative, 
4-year-old than the co-founder of an 
ctivist group. Her short brown hair is 
lean and neatly brushed, and she 
ears jeans, a turtleneck and a lilac 
hetland sweater. Her speech is free of 
argon, and her voice is even, although 
t speeds up slightly when she says 
mething she feels strongly about, as if 
he were t'mbarrassed by the force of 
er feel ings. 
"I think that it is really likely that we 
will have a nuclear war soon, if we don't 
keep pushing harder. If I just sit back 
and let it happen then I am being 
really ... " she pauses 
while she 
searches for the right word," ... pitiful. 
I might as well do something about it 
because othenvise it will be inevitable." 
Her exuberant puppy tries to clamber 
o? to the couch, and Karen gently puts 
htm down. 

Karen got involved in CCND when 
her best friend j essica told her about the 
group and what they were doing. 
"T~ere was a letter-writing campaign 
gomg on, and she said that we could 
start a chapter. So first she asked me 
and all my friends to write letters. It 
took her about three weeks to get me to 
~nall_y write the letter, 'cause I kept put-
tmg 11 off, but finally I wrote it." That 
was when the reality of what they were 
protesting began to sink in. "We started 
thinking about what would happen. 
We're a mile away from the Green, and 
t~e target is the Green, and that was 
kmd of scary," said Karen. "It just kind 
of hit me. After that I think I was 
~?tivated to do something. Maybe that 
IS JUSt how I am-when I see something 
wrong I have to try and fix it. It makes 
me feel better, and I think it would help 
a lot of kids." 

Members are proud that they run 
CCND tht'm~t>Ives, explained Karen. 
"We've had a couple of problems with 
people saying '"ho's the director, who's 
running things, who's the adult here," 
"he said, .. except there's no adult- it's 
just kids, and we can tell you a few 
things that we have done, and what is 
happening here if you want, but there is 
no adult here. and wt" run it. E\(·rvcmc
