"I am not an activist, I am an in-
dividualist. But the quality of my life 
went up the day I joined.".Jane Krieger 
did not vote for a union when she was 
first offered a 
ballot in 
1977. "I 
associated unions with truck drivers and 
men smoking cigars," said Krieger, an 
employee of the British Art Center. 
Four years later she had changed jobs 
four times. Each change, billed as a 
promotion, brought with it the same 
salary classification. Feeling trapped in 
a dead-end situation, Kreiger saw two 
alternatives: accept the status quo, or 
leave. Her voice rims with intensity as 
she states, "Joining the union gave me a 
whole new set of options, ways to 
change my situation." 

For Kneger and other active mem-
bers of Local 34, the Federation of 
University Employees, the events of the 
past few weeks have been an all-absorbing 
preoccupation. the culmination of four 
years of work. Other workers feel the

union's presence has brought only 
dissension and division. The decision 
whether or not to join Yale's newest 
union forced many to rethink their at-
titudes about their jobs, their careers 
and their roles in the University com-
munity. Behind the strike publicity the 
union has quietly brought about many 
changes in the lives of Yale's clerical and 
technical workers. 

Krieger's pro-union shift was not uni-
que among Local 34 members. At-
tempts to organize a clerical union 
failed in 1968, 1971 and 1977, although 
each time by a smaller margin. John 
Wilhelm, chief negotiator for Local 34, 
interprets the success of this union as 
the reflection of larger national trends. 
"As our economy shifts more and more 
towards services and away from heavy 
industry," he said, "I think the labor 
movement will have to shift with it." 

However, these service or "pink col-
lar" jobs are usually held by women who 
are new to organized labor. Susie 
Eyzaguirre, a clerical worker in the 
Medical School, explains, "We've always 
been 
'professionals.' We 
bought 
business suits and went to night school. 
And there's this traditional 
prejudice 
against 'professionals' organizing." 

Eyzaguirre came to Yale from Barnard 
as the wife of a graduate student and 
began working part-time. Now a di-
vorced mother of two, she says, "I kept 
thinking I was going on to do I don't 
know what. But at some point I guess I 
grew up. I thought, if I don't take my 
job seriously now, when will I?" She 
joined the union and became a member 
of the negotiating committee. 

Like Eyzaguirre, many women in 
Yale's new union are slowly coming to 
the realization that their "temporary" 
jobs are not going away. The union has 
given these women a forum for their 
ideas about on-the-job training pro-
grams, day care for their children and 
salary raises. It gives them control over 
their careers to an extent not possible 
before. Eyzaguirre smiles. "I don't 
mean to wax poetic about all this 'com-
munity' stuff, but this union has given 
women I know the courage to stand up 
for themselves, to say 'I'm important' in 
a way they never could before." She 
pauses. "When I joined, I met all of 
these terrific people, doing interesting 
jobs all over Yale, and affecting the Yale 
community in important ways, none of 
whom I ever knew existed before." 

For its members, union meetings 
have served as the basis for a whole new 
network of friends and associates. 
Eyzaguirre laughs. "The University 
probably should negotiate to keep us on 
campus. They have no idea how much 
better things run." Krieger points to 
some subtler advantages. "Now, if you 
want to know something, say about a 
job transfer, you know who to call. It 
wasn't that we weren't trying to get 
ahead at Yale before the union, it was 
that we had to do it alone. There was 
this feeling that you could make it at 
Yale, but only if you looked out for your 
own interests." 

Local 35, the dining hall and 
maintenance union, has for the past 
decade shown Yale's clericals what a 
union can achieve. With a 
tight 
organization and a series of very effec-
tive strikes, they have gained salaries 
and benefits superior to those of the 
clericals. To Eyzaguirre the connection 
was obvious. "It wasn't that Yale valued 
its truck drivers and dishwashers more 
than its secretaries and librarians, it's 
just that the truck drivers had a voice, 
but the secretaries didn't." 

Sitting in her office on Ashmun Street, 
Lisa Huck is on the other side of the 
campus and on the other side of the 
union controversy from Eyzaguirre and 
Krieger, but she speaks with equal con-
viction. "Unions take away initiative 
and drive," she said, "and are not con-
ducive to a working atmosphere, which 
some people seem to forget is what this 
is supposed to be." Huck, a former Yale 
Divinity School student, now a com-
puter operator 
in 
purchasing 
department, 
becomes increasingly 
"I don't mind paying fifteen dollars a month 
to get the union off my back."
