Eaglin. For him there was no sq>ara-
tion between what happened in tlw do 
jo and what happent·d in tht· outsidt• 
world. He had always pern·ivt·d himsl'lf 
as a gentle man, yet he was living in a 
world of total violem:c. He dropp<•d out 
of the art. H e had been teaching at the 
YMCA in Cambridge. "I walkt·d 10 the 
Y and tOld my students that I quit," he 
says. "I told them that karatt' is neither 
good nor bad. but simply what you 
choose to do." 
Eaglin felt diffused- he wasn't train-
ing- he didn't have a center. There was 
a void in his life. "Trainin~ scoops it all 
up and says 'straight down that road,"' 
"I am seeking to 
perform th e perfect 
act. " 
he says. "There is an ugly fet'lin~ that 
comes from people. who think tht•y're in 
an art to hurt people." After much 
thought, he returned to the art. Now, 
he says, "The sparring is n:duced. I'm 
more interested in perfection of form 
and moving into different states of 
mind." 

M editation is an important part of 
karate. Zen. "M y perception is that the 
'spirit' in the mystical sense is tht· soun·c 
of all things," says Eaglin. The st>nse of 
spirit relies on 
the 
disc-ipline and 
maturity of the martial artist. One must 
get rid of the excitement to practice: the 
art requires control. It is not a physi<·al 
vent for frustrations. "You have to be 
able to act without emotion,,~ ht• savs. 
'"If you are acting in a deta<:hed fa,hion. 
it is the same thing to put out your hand 
to kill and to put out your hand to tout"h 
and love. If I am successful. I withdraw 
from the fruits of m\- labor and att for 
the joy of acting- I am '-t'l'in~ to per-
form the perfect act." 
Room EF feels empty. "I "ant to 
hear you breathe," sa>·s Ea~hn Side by

his students stand as if on 
horseback. They look like J apanese 
cowboys; they are strong, silt"nt and 
under control. Eyes dosed. tht•ir fates
