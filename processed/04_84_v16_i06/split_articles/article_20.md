"Nuclear war is a big thing," said 
Karen, "and I think that's why so many 
kids are starting to think about it, and 
saying, 'Hey we've had these weapons 
for 40 years and the adults aren't doing 
anything about it, maybe we should 
start speaking up- it worries us too.'" 

A Russian girl to whom Karen spoke 
by satellite when she appeared on The 
Today Show echoed the same sentiment. 
"I asked Tanya what she thought when 
people said 'You're only a kid, why are 
you doing this?'" said Karen. "She 
replied that she thought that maybe the 
leaders were getting senile, and of course 
we should be working on this- it's our 
world too.'" 

The parents and many teachers of the 
members of CCND are the grown up 
children of the sixties. Many were in-
volved in the activism of that time, 
something their children are very aware 
of, sometimes more than they are. "I 
have trouble convincing him that I was 
not a hippie in 
the sixties," said 
Donald's mother. 

Most parents agree that they have 
more respect for their children's opin-
ions than their parents had for theirs. "I 
think taking children seriously 
is 
something new," said Dr. Kim Jane-
way, Katie's mother. "Absolutely, hav-
ing a parent fromÂ· the sixties has had a 
big influence on these kids." 

"It 
important 
that 
they are 
respected as people, not treated as 
another species- sheltered, ignored, or 
controlled," said Liz Gersten, Karen 
and Sara's mother. "You want to listen 
with respect. Our respecting them frees 
them up to work with us too, it em-
powers them not to feel like an op-
pressed minority- that they must ac-
cept or rebel. They are responsible 
about their actions." 

The kids feel that they have come to 
their opinions on their own. "I was in-
fluenced by my parents, by the fact that 
I was educated by them," said Katie. "I 
wasn't told how to think. They told me 
what they thought and I could object to 
it if I wanted to. I think if my parents 
had been pro-nuke I probably would 
have objected to it, and then I wouldn't 
have been influenced by them." "I was 
brought up to disagree with my mother," 
said Josh. "It was 'Do what you want; if 
you agree with me it is a coincidence.'" 

The parents have another equally 
powerful legacy to pass on to their 
children. They have grown up with a 
knowledge and fear of nuclear weapons 
which has been reinforced by each new 
bit of information. Most remember 
hiding under their desks during air-


drills. "when no one thought we would 
be annihilated," said Dr. Janeway. "I 
don't think I thought then that we 
would be annihilated." 

Their feelings have deepened. "I have 
a fear that is like falling off a bridge," 
she said. "It is a real fear to me ... that 
this will hurt me physically and in many 
other ways." That same feeling, a con-
crete imagining of the effects of a 
nuclear war and a conviction that one 
could happen in their lifetimes, is 
shared by most of the members of 
CCND. They 
are 
not 
perpetually 
haunted by it, but the conviction in 
their voices when they speak of war is 
unmistakable. The parents did not need 
formal lectures to tell their children 
about their fear of nuclear arms; the 
strength of their feelings has come 
across in casual conversations over the 
dinner table. 

The parents see the issue of the 
nuclear arms race as one which cannot 
be eluded and must be dealt with in a 
responsible manner. "What they are do-
ing is the best possible response. They 
are facing up to the problem rather than 
escaping or ignoring it," said Dr. 
Charlie Janeway. "I think that it would 
be atrocious for them not to know that 
the issue exists, not to have a clear-
headed picture of what the realities are, 
and having that picture I don't see that 
there is really much choice how you 
stand on the matter." 

"It is so important to have some ac-
tion one can take," said Ms. Gersten. "It 
is helpful for all of us, particularly the 
kids, since they are more likely to feel 
helpless in terms of their whole lives. If 
you have control over a little piece then 
you don't despair." 

It seems to work. "I think a lot of peo-
ple have nightmares about nuclear war 
because they have no hope at all," said 
Karen. "It helps if you are doing 
something. Of course I think about 
nuclear war more than the average kid 
would, but it helps a lot. I don't have 
nightmares about nuclear war."
