"The minority students have always been 
asked to be bilingual in a kind of m ental 
and emotional and linguistic sense." 
member, pastor of the Black Church at 
Yale, jazz saxophonist and music 
graduate student, defends the House 
against accusations that it ·promotes 
separatism. "The white students are 
more than welcome at the AACC. 
There's never been any kind of move to 
exclude them. What we've tried to do is 
to 
make 
sure 
the 
Afro-American 
heritage had a voice on campus, and 
that's not simply for the black students, 
but for the benefit of all. The same is 
true for the Black Church at Yale. We 
have white students who are members, 
we have white faculty members who 
come, white students who are in the 
choir. Those people have elected to 
come in and take seriously whatever the 
black spiritual and religious agenda is 
and J:>ecome a part of it." 
Ezra Stiles senior Kori King affirmed 
Andrews' views. "It never was the 
Center's purpose to serve as an instru-
ment of segregation," she said, "and 
there is no conspiracy to limit the ser-
vices of the Center to blacks. Only the 
individual is at fault for failing to seek 
out 211 Park Street." 
Through most of Yale's history, there 
were never more than one or two black 
students. In the late 1950s the college 
began to admit more black under-
graduates, but by 1964 there were still 
only 20 on campus. The class of 1968 
included 14 blacks, the class of '70 had 
33 and the class of '73 contained a 
record 96 black men and women. Many 
of those students 
weren't 
entirely 
satisfied withc_yv~at ,they found here. A 
historical paper at the AACC notes that 
blacks fQund campus mixers not to their 
liking and were even hassled by univer-
sity police who mistook them for un-
wanted townspeople. In the mid-sixties 
the Black Student Alliance at Yale 
formed to address such problems. Ac-
cording to Jackson, b lack students had 
four primary concerns: to monitor 
Yale's interaction with the New Haven 
community, increase the number of 
black students and faculty, insure that 
the curriculum reflected black history 
and culture, and promote student ac-
tivities that reflected their heritage. 
Working with President Kingman 
Brewster's receptive administration, 
black students lobbied to introduce the 
Afro-American Studies major in 1969 
and convinced the Corporation to 
charter the AACC, two gains which 
came without the violence and building 
seizures that occurred•at colleges like 
Cornell in the late sixties and early 
seventies.

"I think that this university has been 
extraordinarily careful to do what it can 
to meet the needs of its minority stu-
dents," said Jackson, "but I do think 
there are certain kinds of things in-
herent in being a white, male, elitist in-
stitution for 300 years that just can't be 
wiped out in 15 or 20. I don't think 
anybody means for these problems to be 
there. What you hear most from the 
black students are things that occur 
because of the reality of being a minori-
ty. For instance, if there are only 300 
black students, you better believe that 
there are a lot of people who are still the 
only black students in their classes. 
Slavery comes up and everybody looks 
at them! I still hear one story every year 
of the black person who gets into a room 
and the parent of a white roommate is 
there and says, 'Oh, you're my son's 
roommate?' I mean this really does hap-
pen. At least once a year I hear that." 
Black students also find themselves 
having to explain the more mundane 
characteristics of black 
culture 
curious whites. "There's always the 
weight of the things people don't know 
about," Jackson explained. "How you 
do your hair- the fascination with 
every little thing that you take for 
~ted. Sec. the thing about being 
black in America is vou know even:-
thing about what 
,~·hitc people do 
~cause it's everywhere. It's on TV. it's 
tn the magazines. The opposite is n()t 
true." 
The problems black students ex-
perience at Yale can sometimes be more 
"erious. "There are subtle things and 
there are not-so-subtle things," said 
Alexander. "Subtle things like, 'Oh, 
you're not really black You're preppv.' 
as if one cancels out the other. Or, 
'\Vhat do black people think about ... ?' 
Or, 'You just got in here because you're 
a black woman.' Now this is subtle. I'm 
quoting things that all have been said to 
me. Then when vou think of not-
so-subtle things . . . . There was a 
college seminar that I actually had to 
withdraw from because the teacher was 
very uncomfortable when I would write 
about 'black things.' Now that was very 
interesting tO me because I wasn't 
always \Hiting about C.'\plicitly black 
things. I was writing about me. A nd he 
threatened to kick me out of his class if I 
didn't stop \Hiting about 'black stufT.'" 
This difficulty in finding common 
cultural ground at Yale extends to the 
graduate level as '"ell. 0\ ... ight Andrews
