To the Editor: 
It is oddly gratifying but fundamentally
distressing to observe the extraordinary
way the Sixties Myth "intimidates" you
"consciously" and "subconsciously." This period of "student 
protest" was not "a frivolous and 
misguided affair." Our essential problem was losing. 

Jolted by assassinations (Malcolm 
X, Martin Luther King, Robert Kennedy) 
and 
disrupted 
by 
illegal 
wiretaps, 
informers, 
agent 
provocateurs 
government 
conspiracies (Operation COINTELPRO, 
Operation CHAOS), we lost the large 
battles to transform American society. 
We did not end the war fast enough. 
we did not fundamentally redistribute 
wealth, we did not stem the arms race, 
nor did we end an imperialist foreign 
policy that still sides with oppressive 
dictators against movements for social 
justice, most evidently these days in 
Central America. 

Yes, Mr. Sides, it was a glorious era; 
free marches on Washington, May 
Day, and all the other protests were 
not primarily social events (despite admitted overindulgence in sex, drugs, 
and rock 'n' roll), but glamorous, ex-
citing 
ultimately 
important 
historical events-even at Yale! It re-
mains a mystery to me and others in the 
"Big Chill" generation who have not 
abandoned the causes which 
ignited 
our bright college years, why you and 
your colleagues do not rise with pas-
sion to the issues of your time. Surely 
Reagan's policies toward El Salvador, 
Nicaragua, Honduras, South Africa, 
Grenada and Chile must raise your 
ire? How can 
new escalations of 
nuclear madness or the ever more 
deadly threats of toxic waste, acid rain 
and other impending environmental 
disasters not 
inspire a 
passionate 
anger? And 
finally, 
how can you 
stand for the human mistreatment Reagan 
malevolently inflicts upon working 
people, the poor and the elderly with 
his evanescent "safety nets"? Where the 
hell are you people? We made many
errors 
born 
of excess 
immaturity - errors 
which 
can 
be 
recognized and avoided- but we never 
failed to fight. Mr. Sides, seize the 
time.
