The meeting was an exercise in con-
trolled mayhem. Ahhough only seven 
people showed up, the clamor of their 
voices and laughs easily filled 13-year-
old Katie Janeway's 
lan~e. brightly 
decorated bedroom. It seemed in-
congruous and unlikely that this group of 
allracti\'C and lx>isterous adolescents 
should be gathered to discuss strategies 
for opposing nucl<'ar war. Fourteen-
year-olds Karen Gt•rsten and Jessica 
Williams, co-founders of the 
t ew 
Haven Children's Campaign 
for 
Nuclear Disarmament, sat with Karen's 
12-year-old sister Sara on the floor. The 
twins Moira and F'anya Cutler, also 14, 
cha11ered with tlwm from the bed and 
beanbag chair. Thirteen-year-old Josh 
Bloom wandered restlessly around the 
room, examining Katie's things and 
flicking small 
o~je<.ts at people who 
weren't watching. 
pf children. In the last two years tht 
New Haven chapter has appeared oa 
local and national television, spoken to 
classes, written letters and organiztd 
rallies to educate people about the issu< 
of nuclear arms and to promote l 
nuclear freeze. It is also the hea:: 
chapter of the international CCND. 
which has over 70 chapters in countritl 
including France, England, Swedt11 
and Japan (but none in the Sovicl 
Union). Although the group provic:ks 
children with a way to work out thc:ll' 
feelings and fears about nuclear war 
most meeting time is spent doin( 
business- reading petitions and letter!. 
organizing smaller groups and plannin( 
fund raising and rallies. Currently tht 
group is working on the "Students fora 
Future" rally to be held on the New 
Haven Green in early May. 
"You have grown-upc; <>aying, 'Let me 
out of here. I don't want to think about 
it,"' said Moira. 
"If we all have these nuclear weapons 
around when we grow up the problem 
will still be there," said Josh. "There are 
people who say that you don't have to 
worry about it, that you should just live 
now and enjoy the world, don't think 
about it ... " 
"But that's wrong," cut in Sara em-
phatically. "By pushing it aside you are 
just procrastinating until there's trou-
ble, and then you'll wish you'd done 
something."
