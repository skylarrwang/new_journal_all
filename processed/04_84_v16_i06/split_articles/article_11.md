Steve Kiesling '80 set himself apart from 
his fellow Yale students and oarsmen 
when he made the US Olympic crew 
team four years ago. Although his in-
terests have led him in other directions 
since graduation, he has now returned 
to his first talent and is trying to make 
the 1984 Olympic team in a pair with 
former Yale teammate Matt Labine '81. 

Ironically, Kiesling thought of quit-
ting crew during his junior year-"Its 
all-absorbing nature became absurd," he 
recalled. Instead, Kiesling applied to 
the Scholar of the House program, hop-
ing to gain some perspective on athletics 
and academics. Specifically, he planned 
to make the US Olympic crew team in 
1980 and to write a book about it- a 
large project, especially for someone 
who had been rowing for less than three 
years and had never "written anything 
longer than a ten-page term paper." It 
took Kiesling months to write his pros-
pectus, and because of its main re-
quirement-making the Olympic team 
-he calls the proposal "his best selling 
job ever." It was accepted and his "en-
tire being became absorbed" in his 
goals. 

Kiesling made the Olympic team and 
wrote 
his 
project. The committee 
thought his work was "illiterate" and 
gave Kiesling a B. In fact several times 
during his senior year the Scholar of the 
House committee had tried to throw 
him out of the program. "They felt like 
they'd turned a jock loose to do nothing 
more than train athletically," says Kies-
ling. Instead of complaining, he revised 
part of the draft and got it published as 
The Still Gam~, which sold 20,000 copies 
and received favorable book reviews, 
including one in The New York Times. 

Kiesling then joined the staff of the 
new magazine American Health, where 
two years later, he has become senior 
editor. His work on an article for 
American Health inspired him to his next 
project: a video exercycle. From his 
research Kiesling concluded that video 
games are the "mental equivalent of 
sport" because of the stress they induce. 
When experimenting with a blood 
pressure monitor he claims he found 
them to be even more stressful than be-
ing with his girlfriend. 

So, 
with the 
help of electrical 
engineer Dave Potter, also a former 
Yale oarsman, Kiesling decided to hook 
up video games to exercycles. The 
result, the "aerobics joystick," required 
its 
user 
to peddle 
a 
bicycle to 
manipulate the video game's joystick. 
Although Kiesling went around the 
country on a promotional tour which 
included spots on The Today Show, CBS 
News and PM Magazine, he was too late. 
The video game craze had peaked and 
the public showed little interest. 

After these various projects, why has 
Kiesling decided to row again? He 
states, "My girlfriend was transferred to 
Paris. I had nothing better to do." 

Labine, his partner, attributes their at-
tempt to make the Olympic team to an 
"improbable combination of bizarre 
coincidences," adding a barely audible 
comment of "right place at the right 
time," without elaborating. As for their 
chances of actually making the team on 
what at first was little more than a lark, 
Kiesling playfully states, "They're get-
ting better all the time." 


**NewsJournal: Mail Stuffing**

We have to admit it. We were wrong.
In "Basketball Bounces Back" (TNJ, 
Dec. 7, 1983) we all but handed Y.U.
basketball an Ivy League championship. The team's subsequent 4-10 Ivy
League record (7-19 overall) landed 
Yale dead last in the league, disappointing
both players and fans. 

Apparently some people were more
disappointed than others. A recent letter
sent to Yale alumni across the country
attributes the team's poor season to 
second-year coach Tom Brennan. Calling
Brennan "an embarrassment to 
YALE," the writers charge Brennan 
with intolerable behavior on the court, 
exploitation of the team's black players
to win a coaching job at a larger school,
and all-around bad coaching. "He is,"
the authors say further, "an internal problem, one we would like to
take care of within the Old Blue Family
... before Brennan and his conduct
become a public issue." The proposed
solution: 
concerned 
alumni should
bombard President A. Bartlett Giamatti
and Athletic Director Frank Ryan with
letters demanding the immediate firing
of Coach Brennan.
