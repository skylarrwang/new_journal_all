agitated as she lists incidents of union-
inspired antagonism. Huck claims to 
have overheard personal abuse directed 
at non-union members, has seen papers 
overturned and moved on co-workers' 
desks, and recounts that co-worker Ann 
Fiore received a package of dead fish in 
the mail. Along with Fiore, she recently 
formed a group of anti-union clerical 
and technical workers (C&T-), an 
organization she says will continue, 
although the threat of an imminent 
strike has disappeared. She explains, "It 
can be very isolating to feel like you're 
the only one who doesn't buy the union 
line, who likes her job at Yale." Huck, 
Fiore 
and 
the 
approximately 400 
workers they represent see the union's 
success as the result of coercion and 
"strong-arm" tactics, not communal ef-
fort. 

However, 
union 
proponents attribute its success in overcoming tradi-
tional stereotypes to its unique organizing 
methods. Like most unions Local 34 
began with a small group of 30 "charter 
members," led by a representative from 
the International. From there, instead 
of immediately trying to get a quorum 
for an election, the group decided to 
develop a real grassroots base and to 
educate employees about the issues. 
This meant a lot of talking-or "arm-
twisting," according to Lisa Huck. Ann 
Brocker, 
one 
of the union's paid 
organizers, simply shrugs off such ac-
cusations. "The premise behind the 
drive was that if someone wanted to 
stick her head in the sand, we wanted to 
pull it out and tell her to listen." 

Organizing from the inside also 
meant employing organizers who knew 
the Yale community. Local 35, Yale's 
dining hall union, was already here, 
and its organizers, including Wilhelm, 
were crucial in getting Local 34 off the 
ground. Brocker, a 1977 graduate, ex-
emplifies the kind of person involved. 
She first worked in a union while she


was a student, and since then has had 
various kinds of organizing experience. 
She explains, "my job is to organize 
myself out of a job. The people in the 
offices have really done the work 
themselves. We've made a commitment 
to talk to every worker, so that everyone 
has a part to play." 

Once a 
final contract has been 
signed, none of the International's 
organizers plan to work at Yale. In-
stead, the leadership positions will all be 
filled by union members. Spokeswoman 
Krieger explains, "We will never 
stop organizing, because with every 
change in the workplace, our union has 
to change too. A union has to be what 
its workers want it to be." She remembers 
that in 1977, "I bought the whole 
thing-'Yale is your family' and all of 
that. I didn't realize that a union could 
also be a democracy." The "grassroots" 
organizing tactics slowly 
changed 
Krieger's and others' opinions. 

Democracy did become a very im-
portant issue for many members when 
the decision was made not to strike. 
Some left the vote early, threatening to 
resign, claiming the union capitulated 
under pressure. Wilhelm believes dis-
satisfaction comes from workers who 
are unfamiliar with the contract, which 
as far as he knows is the only one of its 
kind. Although it does not raise salaries, 
it institutes grievance procedures which 
will allow workers to have their job clas-
sifications changed and their salary 
classifications raised without impossible 
paperwork. It also guarantees job se-
curity if a clerical is fired because of 
funding cuts or department reorganiz-
ation. 

Finally, the interim contract does not 
contain a no-strike clause. "This con-
tract is extremely unusual," says Wil-
helm. "I don't know of any others like it. 
I'm just tickled at the tactical oppor-
tunities it opens up," alluding to the 
possibility of a short strike. Eyzaguirre 
points to the positive side of the dissen-
sion within the union. "There's a lot of 
energy out there, and it can be chan-
neled. People were ready to strike. 
Believe me, if no contract has been 
signed by graduation, you'll hear from
