EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
George-my inner guide with a beard 
and a \\.hite gown, This was an incredi-
ble experience because I never thought 
it would happen. I found I could talk to 
George and get very honest answers, 
some of \\.hich I didn't neccssaril>· like." 
The power of this and other mental 
exercises impres<.ed him. He asked 
George if he should go back to school 
and become a psvchiatrist. "He told me, 
'Don't forgt.·t, Sit·gcl, you're a little vain. 
You don't want to giv<.· up something 
you're good at. And you can open doors 
being in a hospital, do things like death 
and dying counseling, talking with pa-
tients, kissing them. hugging them.' 
"So I remained a surgeon."


He started reading enormous amounts, 
especially Carljung. H e learned to use 
dreams to diagnose physical illness and 
illustrate the mind's awareness of the 
body. He was astounded b}' the preci-
sion of those diagno. es. One of his 
young patients dreamt that his teddy 
bear was on crutches and had one leg 
missing. 1-i'e woke up and told his 
brother: "M y leg has cancer, but don't 
tell mommy." A year later his leg had to 
be amputated above the knee. 
A woman dreamt that the top of her 
head was shaved. and on her scalp was 
the word "CANCER" in b i<Xk letters. 
There were no svmptoms to show her 
doctor, so she stayed at home, waiting, 
until the pain began. 
Dr. 
Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, 
the 
author of On Death and Dying, taught 
him a drawing technique that also adds 
to the overall diagnosis. The method 
assigns certain meanings to colors and 
the placement of images on the page. 
Siegel would have his patients draw pic-
tures of themselves and their suspected 
illnesses, then review them after the pa-
tients became ill and try to map the cor-
respondences. 
He notes, "The drawings allowed me 
to deal with symbols that were truer and 
more revealing than spoken language. 
As a surgeon, having both the minds 
and bodies to work with, I was able to 
train myself. I am now able to predict 
future events based upon unconscious 
beliefs and attitudes."


He has the energy of a man who gets 
the governor's pardon moments before 
they strap him into the chair. Bernie 
Siegel is ionized almost beyond belief. 
His is not nervous energy; he has no 
trouble sitting stilL His words are rapid-
fire, his gestures sharp and sweeping. 
He gives off the glow of the born-again. 
His mission is wide-ranging: surgery 
and sermon , probing with scalpel and 
scythe. His medical practice encom-
passes end-stage care, 
preventive 
strategies and 
mental 
heahh. 
His 
spiritual practice draws on all of the<.e 
and more. H e says he feel 
mo t at 
home in a church or temple. He sull 
finds time to consult George and u e 
his advice. H e does so many thing . but 
shows no outward signs of doubt. ;\lone 
at all.

One of Sieltcl's students, when asked to draw a boat, drew this picture. "'What's wrong with your breasts?" h e ask ed . 
The student was diagnosed as h aving a hormone p roblem with her b reasts. 
They <ould die. I'm involved in it. But 
if the patient does die.·, I still have a role: 
to hdp heal those.· who have had this 
loss, to shan· their pain. I wish more 
doctors would do this, bn:ause the feed-
back ir positive. Pt•oplc know we aren't 
perfc<:t. ~


faith in a particular therapy can deter-
mine ih sun css. Siegel uses the draw-
ings to divim· his patients' attitudes. 
"If JX'ople draw their cht·motherapy 
as a bum h of arrowo;. but not one single 
arrow poiming to their cancer, then you 
kno'' that their unnmo;cious is sayinlt, 
'This \tuft is totally int>fTcctive and it 
huns me' Paric.•nto;. who sav yes to the 
d<Ktnr bur sc.·c.· the chemotherapy as 
poison will n·m·r as if poisoned. The pic-
ture c.·an reveal this and help the patient 
avoid rhe problem by dealinlt with it 
consc.·iously."


.. 1 don't l{t'l depressed bec.·ause I don't do 
rhin~ts to patic.·nts anymore. If you come 
10 me as a patient and <>ay, 'Help me get 
well,' I 'iay, 'Thc.•sc.• are the ways I can 
44 Tht• ;-., ..... Juurn.ti/April 20. 1984 
help,' and if you say that's accc.·prable, 
then \'lle're a team. We do it togetht·r. 
We operate, and you wake up and f(:d 
great, and I walk out f<.·ding great 
because we're a ream. The kl·y is shar-
ing. T hat's how I save my life."


H e repeats a favorite quotation from 
Albert Schweitzer's writings: "It's sup-
posed to be a professional secret, but I'll 
tell you anyway. 
We doctors do 
nothing. We only help and encourage 
the doctor within."


Siegel sent out a letter 10 about one 
hundred cancer patients, telling thc.·rn 
he had discovered something whic·h 
could probably improve the quality and 
extent of their lives. H e expc.•ctcd at 
least 
five 
hundred 
replies 
and 
wondered how he'd scat them all. H~ 
got twelve respono;es. 
"This was when I began to under-
stand that nor all patients want to g<>t 
well. It made me really begin to wonder 
what we as physicians arc doing."


~About fifteen to twenty percent of peo-
ple who arc seriously ill would prefer to 
die: if given the opportunity. F ifty to six-
ty percent of patients are willing to get 
better as long as the doctor does the 
work and the medicine doesn't taste too 
bad. The final fifteen to twenty percent 
sa)', 'I'll do anything I have to do to get 
well. Just show me."' 
People from the last group came to 
form Exceptional Cancer Patients. He 
slows his voice to add weight to his 
words: "When I be~an to meet these 
people, it was the beginning of my edu-
cation. They began to teach me what 
people who want to live have to do. 
\\'hen you spend time with people who 
literally could die tomorro'" but go on 
living, you begin to learn why they're 
waking up each day.-


He explains the four questions he asks 
each or his exceptional cancer patients: 
Do you want to live to be I 00 years 
old? 
.. A positive response says I am in con-
trol of my life and enjoy it. I do not fear 


the futurt' and I have a will to live. ln an 
audience made up of physicians, fewer 
than five percent will respond positive-
ly." 
What has happened in you•· life in the 
year or two prior to the illness? 
"I do not believe that it is a coin-
cidence when a m~jor illness strikes an 
individual. Some examples: an in-
dividual having a desultory love affair 
may develop cancer of the cervix or 
uterus. A mother losing a child may 
well develop cancer of the breast." 
What does the diagnosis mean to 
you? . 
"Doctors must deal with negative ex-
pectations, theirs and the patient's. 
Since they do not know the future, they 
must give the patient the chance to be 
the exception. Statistics can kill, emo-
tions can make you well." 
Why do you need this illness? 
"Sometimes it provides the patients 
with benefits that can be achieved 
through more positive means-atten-
tion, love ,control- the possibilities are 
limitless. One patient of mine entered 
the hospital after her remission from-
cancer 
for other 
reasons, 
simply 
because she had no one to tell her 
triumph to at home."


On love: 
"Love is the most powerful immune 
stimulant in the body. Not only that, it 
feels good."


Last year a woman came to him and 
said, "I want God to heal me. But I 
want you to monitor it." "I'm very 
unassuming," he notes, "so as a surgeon 
I don't mind monitoring God's work. 
"I'm a believer, I'm open. I see 
things. I believe in the concept of a 
God, as the primal force, as the begin-
ning of our collective unconscious, what 
have you. I'd be willing to label those 
things God. And when I meditate, I 
open myself up to God's presence, to his 
message, in order to do his work. Our 
work, actually."
