**Letters: Delivering H.D. Whole**

As a foreign scholar drawn to Yale by 
the Norman Holmes Pearson collection 
in the Beinecke Library, I was pleased 
that you gave space to Katherine 
Scobey's substantial article "H.D.: the 
Making of a Poet" (TNJ, February 3, 
1984). 

Precisely because information about 
this poet has been slow to surface, we 
should be sure that it is accurate. Ms. 
Scobey's account of H.D. is highly 
resourceful, but I should like respectfully 
to correct its heterosexist assumptions. 

It is not true to say that H.D. "turned 
to bisexuality" after separating from her 
husband or to imply that her "lesbian 
impulses" were in some way occasioned 
by "male rejection." 

H.D.'s love for women as well as for 
men was already evident circa 1910, 
when her intimacy with Frances Gregg 
displaced that with Ezra Pound. This 
episode is fictionalized in HERmione, 
which describes the heroine's doubts 
about her engagement 
to 
"George 
Lowndes" and 
her deep 
sense of 
sisterhood with "Fayne Rabb." Far from 
being followed to London by "a smitten 
Hilda," Pound found himself introducing 
two young women to the capital.
Unfortunately Barbara Guest, in her 
biography of H.D., trivializes this affair 
between the 23-year-old Hilda Doolittle 
and 25-year-old Frances Gregg as "girl-
love" and is reluctant to take on the full 
implications of her later relationships 
with women.


Anyone wishing to understand more 
fully the resonances between H. D.'s life 
and her writings should also turn to two 
essays by Susan Friedman and Rachel 
DuPlessis: "Romantic Thralldom in 
H.D." in Contemporary 
Literature 20 
(1979) and "The Sexualities of H.D.'s 
Her in Montemora 8 (1981). 

These writers point out that: "Virtually
all of H.D.'s ... works ... drastically
underplay her status as a companionate 
woman and her connections 
through Bryher with homosexual and 
lesbian circles in Europe. At the same 
time, the narrative of heterosexual at-
traction, betrayal and victimization was 
a recurrent feature of her writing. Both 
her fiction and poetry frequently ex-
press her need to be delivered from the 
cultural scripts of romantic thralldom in 
which she repeatedly immersed herself." 

As women readers who share that 
need, we have a special responsibility to 
deliver H.D. whole. 

Yours faithfully,
