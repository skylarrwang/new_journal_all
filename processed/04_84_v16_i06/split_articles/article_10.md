**Letters: Toward Perfection**
**Author: Jeffrey W. Clark**
**Page number(s): 5**

I do not share Mr. Sides' view that it is 
arrogant to think that Yale should be a 
perfect place ("Shaving Cream on the 
Floor," TNJ, February 3, 1984). 

Personally, I think the whole world 
should be a perfect place. At the same 
time I don't cross the Green at 3 am. I 
realize that the world and the Yale com-
munity, as a part of that world, is not 
populated with people totally sensitive 
the 
needs of each 
other. (If 
Philadelphia can not live up to its name, 
how much worse the rest of the world 
must be.) 

Having faced that realization, what 
shall we do? Accept the situation and 
harden ourselves to the reality of the 
cold, 
cruel 
world out 
there (i.e., 
Buffalo)? Is it not better that we try to 
improve the situation? 

I, for one, applaud the approach of 
the Yale Students Against Violence by 
Yalies. They call upon the community 
to acknowledge that any behavior harmful 
to others is wrong, and to act accordingly. 
This is not a giant step to take, nor 
does it cram adulthood down our 
throats. We are fortunate that Yale of-
fers us so many opportunities to revel in 
our immaturity as it is. 

The arrogance lies, I think, in believing 
that since we are young and 
sheltered, our acts of violence (of 
whatever degree) should be tolerated as 
"blowing off steam," and that the vic-
tims should tend to themselves. 

Be seeing you,

**NewsJournal: In Appreciation**

As graduation approaches, the magazine
will be losing a hard-working and 
dedicated group from the Class of 1984. 
We extend our thanks to Nicholas 
Christakis, 
Paul 
Hofheinz, 
Katie 
Kressmann, Tom McQuillen, Morris 
Panner, 
Laura Pappano, Vanessa 
Sciarra, Katherine Scobey, Sally Sloan 
and W. Hampton Sides for the talent 
and enthusiasm they brought to the 
magazine. Ed Bennett, who stepped 
down as publisher in September, will 
also be graduating. Ed refounded The 
New journal in 
1981, 
with 
remarkable energy developed 
editorial and business policies which 
have shaped the magazine. We wish 
them all the best of luck in the future.
