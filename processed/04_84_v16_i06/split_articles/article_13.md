"People go to be identified with the 
people there," said one freshman male. 
"There are a lot of Beautiful People who 
are concerned with being beautiful from 
the neck down." Who would have 
thought that the hottest social scene at 
Yale right now would be the Payne 
Whitney Gym? The chic crowd is only 
one faction of Yalies who, joining a 
, growing national trend, have found a 
new way to unwind: an aerobicise class 
taught by sophomore Liz Pitts. 

At 3:45 every Monday, Wednesday 
and Friday afternoon, 80 to 100 people 
, cram into the largest room on the fifth 
floor and spend an hour stretching, lift-
ing, pulling and pumping their ~ies 
~ know gids who've gone out and bought 
u new leotards and stirrup tights just to be 
seen in the exercise class," said one 
junior woman, "and the guys who stand 
in the last row are there to scope. There 
are some exercises that I'm really em-
barrassed to do because there are 
always at least five guys looking in the 
window." 

into hard-earned shape. "It's the whole 
Jane Fonda aerobics syndrome," said 
Liz Massey, Davenport '86. "It'sjockish 
but not too jockish. You know-'1 can 
sweat and stilr wear make-up, too!'" 

Yale's answer to Jane Fonda is 
19-year-old Floridian Liz Pitts. Tall, 
blonde and physically fit. Pitts provides 
a role model for her peers. Hannibal 
Hodgson, Timothy Dwight '86, claim-
ed, "She's our goddess of pain. She's a 
symbol as much as a teacher. She has 
the Tom Sawyer effect of making 
something difficult look so easy." 

Pitts feels that the music she plays 
-everything from 
the Go-Go's to 
jazz- is a big reason for the popularity 
of the class, and students agree. "T'd say 
the class is definitely a turn-on, both do-
ing it and watching it being done,~ said 
Hodgson. "It centers around rhythm. 
There's a constant beat; it tantalize<; 
your primordial need for pulse.~ 

The sensual appeal of a room full of 
highly charged, exuberant bodies can-
not be denied, and the cla'>s has been 
called everything from "sexercise~ to 
"the body discovery of the century . ~ "I 

The "guys in the back" for the most 
part deny these accusal ions. "Guys 
stand in the back because they're em-
barrassed. I neve•· went to scope on 
girls," football player Paul Spivack, 
Timothy Dwight '85, said indignantly. 
"I don't see how you could do the exer-
cises and scope at the same time. 
Besides, I think that the girls are over-
confident as to how attractive they are." 

Wrestler Jirn Tannenbaum, Timothy 
Dwight '85, added. "You're so tired you 
can barely think. It's not the place to 
meet people." 

H owever, many refute this noble 
claim. "People go to sec and be seen," 
said one sophomore male. "They go out 
and buy jumpsuits together and talk 
about their Danskin colors." Brooke 
Runnette, Jonathan Edwards '87, said, 
"It's not so much that people get skinny 
doing it: they get skinny .for it.~ 

Some find the social aspect of the 
class annoying and disrupting. "I've 
gone from the bcl{inning," said Sarah 
Hutt , 
Calhoun 
'86, 
"and 
now 
I 
recognize a large contingent of BPs. 
Frankly, I don't get my kicks from 
aerobics. 
Sweaty. exhausted people 
aren't all that sexy. At this school JX'Ople 
are ah,ays searching for some artificial 
construct of status. and this is just the 
latest thing." 

But whatever the social motivations, 
football players. swimmers, crew jocks, 
sailors. 
hockey 
players 
and 
other 
athletes "do Liz~ and take the workout 
very seriously. As one runner put it. 
"This class rakes you over the coals. 
You feel like jello afterwards." Head 
football coach Carm Cozza commented 
wryly, "Anything that will make tbe 
pl~-ers a little more graceful can onl>• 
help us.~ 

Skeptics say that once the hype from 
the national fitness trend diminishes, so 
will the enrollment of Pitts' class. "Sure.

it's a fad," she admits, "but it's a fad that 
is beneficial. When people feel beuer 
they're going to keep coming.n 

Fad or no, physical activity and social 
interaction combine successfully 
for 
Yale students. "I think the class is really 
a 
fantasy," 
H annibal 
Hodgson 
speculates, "an escape into a world or 
rhythm and intensity. There's a strong 
dichotomy between the personal chal· 
lenge and the social pressure you're 
dealing with. You play the two tensions 
off one another, and your body does 
awesome things."
