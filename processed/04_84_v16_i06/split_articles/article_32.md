O ne year after he shaved his head, 
Siegel used the drawing technique to 
find out why. He drew himself with a 
rainbow-colored 
bird on his right 
shoulder and George counseling him at 
his left. T here was a pond with a fish 
out of water, and mountains whose tops 
were filled in with white crayon. 
K ubler-Ross helped him interpret it. 
T he first thing she asked was "What 
are you hiding? You don't need white 
crayon on white paper." Combining 
this clue with the fish symbol, he real-
ized that he had been hiding his love 
and spirituality, because of the way he 
was taught to practice medicine. And he 
realized that all along he had been get-
ting messages in his meditations to un-
cover something. H e had taken that 
message literally and shaved his head.

On his office desk are a few AN-
TIC IPATE 
M IRACLES bumper 
stickers and a "Bald is Beautiful" mirror 
stand with a fat baby figurine inserted 
in to its wooden base. He wears a rain-
bow "Bernie" button and belt buckle.

"Elizabeth told me"- he imitates 
Kubler-Ross' Swiss accent-"'that the 
spirits, the healing spirits, need a lot of 
energy to materialize, and music pro-
vides that energy.' She likes Hank 
W illiams, so in the operating room I 
play Williams, Willie Nelson, baroque 
music, 'Amazing Grace,' a lot of things. 
I realized what a powerful effect the 
music had on the O.R. when I forgot 
my tapes one day. Everyone missed it, 
especially the nurses. One of my 
associates, Richard Selzer, a surgeon 
and writer, made me realize that when 
they took the windows out of the 
operating room, they took out God. I 
want to bring God back in."

"Years ago, I was giving a speech and 
found myself torn between my planned 
outline and the unplanned things that 
were coming out of my mouth thanks to 
who-knows-what. I fmally decided that 
'the other guy' was doing a better job 
and I let go of the outline and let him 
give the speech." He spoke for 90 
minutes without notes. "Afterwards, a 
woman came up to me and said that 
she'd heard me speak before, but I had 
never been this inspirational. Another 
woman stood before me and said 'I'm a 
medium, and in the middle of your 
speech, this figure appeared before the 
podium. I drew a sketch of him for you.' 
I looked at the paper and cried out, 'My 
God, it's George!'"

Possible epitaph: "You don't have to be 
afraid of living. Because you can stop 
when you want to."

This is one of his favorite stories: "Son-
ny, one of my exceptional patients, 
went to Hospice to die. Surrounded by 
love, she didn't die. After many months 
Sonny's husband asked how to help his 
wife. I told him, 'You have to tell her 
that you and the boys love her and will 
be okay and she can go if she wants to.' 
He told her Wednesday morning while 
shifting her breakfast tray. Wherr he 
turned to look back at her, she had 
gone. Later that day, I was praying for 
her in the hospital chapel. A plaque on 
the wall began to shake. and being the 
scientist that I am, I looked at it dispas-
sionately. The plaque read, 'In the 
midst of life, I am with you.' It was Son-
ny's way of saying goodbye."

He recently spoke at the annual con-
vention of the American Medical Stu-
dent Association. "Think of what I 
could do to the practice of medicine if 
every year I talked to 1000 students! 
I've converted a lot of people in New 
Haven already."

"It hurts me to know that everyone is 
not living the way I know they can live. 
I see people who won't listen to their in-
ner needs, including my own family. 
When I feel or sense conflict, I lzaue the 
answer. But many people just don't 
want it."
