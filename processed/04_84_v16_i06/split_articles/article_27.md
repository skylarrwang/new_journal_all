"I kno .. , vou're gomg to love mt• in a

and instructor of Yale's Show-Kan 
Karate Club. H is voice is like an 
amplifier. lt fills the fifth floor ext:rcise 
room at Payne Whitney Gym, prt•ssing 
against lht• walls and rebounding to tlw 
front of the room where he stands. 

Eaglin is tall. strong and wdl-built. 
"Sit-ups. Ll•t's count twenty around the 
room " His students tighten the bdts 
around their laundered v~ohite uniforms.

Patrick Eaglin has been instruning 
and inspiring students of Shoto· Kan 
Karate at Yale since he founded the pro-
gram in September of 1982. The class is 
small and nl·ws of it travels solt•ly by 
word of mouth. It is not listed in Payne 
W hitnt•v Gym's leaflet of da'lses and a<·· 
tivities: the onlv martial arts classes of·

Eaglin, 40, took up the art 17 years 
ago when he saw a demonstration grven 
by a fourth degree black belt. "The 
serenity that came from that man was 
phenomenal," he recalls. "It was the 
~auty of it that got me." What followed 
m Eaglin's training was not always 
beautiful or serene, but always intt·nse. 
While teaching classes and training 
under Kazumi Tabata, 
the grand 
master of Shoto-Kan Karate, Eaglin 
PU~"'<m·d his studies. He received a Ph.D. 
from Harvard, V~.ent on to be a pro-
fessor of English at Michigan State and 
then entered Yale Law School. This 
spring he will complete his studies and 
exams, and will join a Ia"' firm in Col-
orado. Leaving the program he has 
begun and the students he has in-
structt•d 
will 
be especially difficult 
becaust• of tht• nature of his approach to 
~ the art 

T he Shoto-Kan Karate Club is not 
a n 
O\ er-e ro" ded 
grm 
class of 
undergraduates tl") ing to learn tht• 
moves of a Thursdav-night television 
star. It is not kung-fu. haiku. thop. 
hi f. hi-va and all of that. It is karate-do. 
"Do" ~t·ans ~way of life" in .Japanc'>e. 
and 10 those \'\ho practice the art it is 
just that. Then· is a spirit in the art that 
becomes ins<.'parable from the martial 
artist. "In 
the 
Wt•st 
they call 
it 
charisma." says Eaglin. It is invisible 
control, power; it is what he has spent 
years cultivating in himself. 

Eaglin has a power and a presence 
that is gripping. In room EF he starts 
thl' count with an unintelligible cry. 
Everyone knoV~.s that it means "one." A 
<;in~l~. drivin~ '>yllablt• marks c·very mo-
tion that follows. It is the force and the 
un~ing behind the count, not the count 
itself that matter.,. 

Riccardo 
Fre~gi, a brown belt in 
Morse, is one of thost• student<; inspired 
by Eaglin's intensity. "I saw this huge 
crazy black man," says Frcggi, rccaJiing 
his fir·st impression of Eaglin. "H e was 
knocking people around and he was 
yelling and I said to myself 'this guy's 
crazy'-but I stayed." Frc·~~i. v.·ho has 
sound. "Ewry sin~le time I fought them 
I would ~ct hurt. Then Sensei would 
stand 0\ cr me \••hc·n I was down and he 
would say. 'pain good, Patrick, pain 
good.' And at some point I accepted it." 

The· nec·d to physicalize intense emo-
tions is what initiallr draws many peo-
ple to karate and the other martial arts. 
"People who become fighters have 
urwesolved life anger- they arc· people 
who can ckal with pain.'' says Eaglin. "I 
like being hit-not in the masochi'lti< 
wa\ -but I associate it with manhood 
anil lwroi<;m." In tht.· beginnintt Eal.{lin 
did not hold any respect for those• .. , ho 
could not ovc·rnmw him phvsicall~. For 
him tlw most important part of karate· 
bc·nmw tlw ac·tual fighting: sparring.

trainin~ s<.'ssion, no one could leave· the

"Sensei would stand over me when I was 
down and he would say, 'pain good, 
Patrick, pain good." And at some point I 
accepted it." 
bt·e•n in martial arts training for the past 
four yc·ars, credits Eat.tlin with "getting 
him out of the armcharr. We stopped 
playing patt\-·Cake· 
in 
class," says 
Frc•ggi. "I had the armchair point-of-
view. \\"e would \'<.'ar thc·.;e cute-looking 
white pajamas with colored belts and 
have lots of fun. Aftc·r a few months 
with Patrick I startt·d changing my 
mind." 

Eaglin's teaching '>tylt.· comes from a 
fusion of his personal insi~hts and his 
tratnrng directly under Sensei 
("Teacher" or "Master") Kazumi 
Tabata. Eaglin v.as one of Tabata's five 
original black belts, an achievement 
that demanded an almost blinding in-
tensitv during training. "Tabata put me 
agrun~t people that I wuldn't possiblv 
beat. \\'hen I wa-. a gn:en belt I was
