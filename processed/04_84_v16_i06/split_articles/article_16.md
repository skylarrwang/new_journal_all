The Secret Link

Steve Kohn came to New Haven this 
fall to hire Yale's most talented seniors, 
men and women who were extremely 
bright, were proficient in a foreign 
language, knew how to use a com-
puter 
and loved their country. In 
return for their skills Kohn could offer 
them careers in one of the world's most 
powerful institutions. But Kohn does 
not work for Morgan Stanley, nor 
were the 40 seniors who heard him talk 
interested in working on Wall Street. 
Steve Kohn is a recruiter for the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency. 

Kohn's visit to Yale is an important 
part of the CIA's largest recruitment 
drive in three decades. With the strong 
support of President R eagan, 
the 
Agency is vigorously looking for new 
blood and turning to universities 
across the country to find it. At more 
than 400 schools nationwide, including 
the entire Ivy League, the CIA is busi-
ly searching for the spies of the ·so s. 
C IA advertisements can now be found 
in newspapers and magazines from 
coast to coa.st, from the Los Angeles 
Times 
to 
Wall 
Street Journal. 
Students are responding: as many as 
2000 resumes 
reach the C IA 
m 
Washington every week. 

National recruitment is only a recent 
innovation for the C IA. During its be-
ginning years the CIA sought its 
agents almost entirely from just three 
schools: Yale, Harvard and Princeton. 
Yale graduates in particular would 
come to dominate the Agency, giving 
it the familiar tone of a class reunion. 
Since the formation of the C IA in 
1947, Yalies have found the world of 
intelligence an exciting alternative to 
the slower pace of academia or the 
dangers of front-line fighting. Once 
established within the CIA, Yale grad-
uates sought out their old friends and 
classmates to work alongside them, 
creating a network of Ivy League con-
nections that would control the Agency 
for decades. 

Gaddis Smith, Larned Professor of 
History, now says, "Yale influenced 
the CIA more than any other institu-
tion did. The Agency was very much 
an Ivy elite. It was thought of as roman-
tic and mysterious and it attracted the 
Big Men on Campus." 

Some of the names are familiar: 
William F. Buckley, George Bush, 
William Sloane Coffin. 
However, 
there were many other Yalies who 
entered the CIA whose names and 
stories are not so well known. James 
Angleton, J ack Downey and Richard 
Bissell were part of this group of men, 
creating a world of spies where you 
could still fraternize with your Yale 
classmates. 

James 
Jesus Angleton '39 was 
a brilliant but eccentric man. After 
graduation from Harvard Law School 
Angleton took the advice of his old 
English professor at Yale, Norman 
Holmes Pearson, and joined the Office 
of Strategic Services (OSS), the war-time predecessor to the CIA. Pearson, 
himself a former member of the OSS, 
later said that Angleton took to the in-
telligence business "like a dog to 
water." 

It was in 1943 that Angleton joined 
the OSS; by late 1944 he had assumed 
control of OSS counter-operations 
against the Axis powers in Italy. For 
the patriotic 28- year -old, known as 
"The Poet" because of his fondness for 
Ezra Pound, it was an astonishingly fast 
rise to power. 

Not surprisingly, Angleton moved 
on after the war to the CIA, a fledgling 
organization which desperately needed 
his expertise, his connections and his 
natural aptitude for intelligence. In 
1951 he created and headed the Agen-
cy's counter-intelligence division, the 
first of its kind in America. For the 
next quarter-century Angleton would 
reign as the American master of coun-
ter-intelligence, maybe the best at his 
job in the world. He was obsessed with 
flushing out Soviet agents, constantly 
intent on discovering KGB "moles" 
within th~ CIA. His critics, however, 
thought h1m paranoid (Angleton con-
sidered them probable Russian agents) 
and would by 1974 get him fired , 
casting Angleton out of the intelligence 
community. 

The habits of a spy are deeply in-
grained in Angleton, and he refused to 
talk about his career when questioned. 
His speech reflecting a lifetime of suspi-
cion, Angleton would only say, "I've 
never heard of your magazine. I don't 
know what political slant you may 
have, or what you may be trying to 
prove. A nd I don't like talking about 
my personal life. I'm sorry, but that's 
all I can tell you." 

Ex-CIA agent Jack Downey, now 
Chairman of the Connecticut Public 
Utility Control Authority and a former 
candidate for the U.S. Senate, is not so 
secretive. At Yale Downey was a self-
described jock who played on the varsi-
ty football, wrestling and rugby teams-
as Gaddis Smith put it, a Big Man on 
Campus. He was an English major 
who had the bad luck to graduate in 
1951 at the height of the Korean War. 
On the advice of Political Science Pro-
fessor Arnold Wolfers, Downey at-
tended a CIA recruitment meeting in 
the spring of his senior year. He still 
remembers it clearly: "Everyone was 
looking for the best deal he could get, 
and the CIA was a glamorous option. 
Unlike the situation in the Vietnam 
War, it was taken for granted that 
you'd serve in some way. It was either 
the CIA or fight in Korea."

Downey chose the C IA. Unlike An-
gleton, the ex-athlete moved into the 
operations side of the Agency rather 
than work in intelligence analysis. He 
recalls that in tratntng camp "half of 
my class was from Yale, Harvard or 
Princeton." Despite his decision not to 
join the military, Downey was not un-
committed, nor unpatriotic. "My at-
titude," he said, "and that of my Yale 
classmates was that the war was a 
direct result of a Communist probe 
that had to be resisted. We really 
believed that the free world depended 
on the United States. Today, that must 
sound a little naive, but I still think it's 
basically accurate." 

Downey paid for his convictions 
with the loss of 21 years freedom. In 
November of 1952 he was captured by 
Chinese Communist troops in Man-
churia. He had flown into the country 
to meet with a CIA agent working 
there, but the rendezvous had gone 
wrong; the C IA's plant had been dis-
covered, and Downey and his crew 
were ambushed. Until 1973 Downey 
was held captive in a Chinese prison, 
cut off from the outside world. Finally, 
as Cold War tensions were receding 
and Richard Nixon was normalizing 
relations with China, J ack D owney 
was allowed to return home. Eleven 
years later he has the humor and 
strength to say, "I'd planned to take 
some time off after college, but it 
turned out to be a lot longer than I had 
planned." 

While Downey was languishing in a 
Chinese prison, another Yale graduate 
was working his way up the C IA lad-
der. Confident, brilliant and ambi-
tious, Richard Bissell came from a 
background familiar to the intelligence 
community: Groton 
'28, Yale '32. 
After teaching at Yale and M IT Bissell 
helped formulate the Marshall Plan. 
The C IA was a logical next step, and 
Bissell joined the Agency in 1954. 
With surprising understatement Bissell 
now says he joined the CIA simply 
because he thought it would be "an in-
teresting job." 

Within a year Bissell had assured his 
success at intelligence-gathering. 
Almost single-handedly he developed 
the U-2 reconnaissance plane, a tre-
mendous breakthrough for an intel-
ligence service which, nearly a decade 
after its inception, still knew embar-
rassingly little about the Russians. For 
four years U-2 flights boldly took pic-
tures of the Soviet Union until, as one 
of Bissell's contemporaries said admir-
ingly, "It was impossible for the Soviets 
to lay a sewer pipe in Siberia without 
CIA knowing it." Though the U-2 pro-
gram would come to an abrupt end 
with 
the shooting down of Gary 
Powers in 1960, Bissell's reputation 
was untouchable. By that time he had 
already developed the satellites to 
replace his plane. 

Bissell's extraordinary talents were 
quickly noticed by CIA Director Allen 
Dulles, who in 1959 made Bissell the 
CIA 
Deputy 
Director 
for 
Plans 
(DDP). After less than five years as an 
agent, Bissell had become head of the 
covert action arm of the CIA. "At the 
time," B.issell now says wistfully, "the 
political climate for the job was very 
favourable, probably more so than at 
any time since." 

For Bissell covert action often meant 
covert 
assassination. 
In 
1960 
he 
ordered the death of African Jead~r 
Patrice Lumumba through the injec· 
tion of a lethal virus into Lumumba'S 
toothpaste. The plan failed. In that 
same year Bissell woulrl supply guns to 
the political opponents of Rafael Tru· 
jillo, brutal dictator of the DominicaJl 
Republic. Some of these guns would 
later show up in the hands of the rnen 
who killed Trujillo. 

But because of pressures from John 
and Robert Kennedy, Fidel Casu{) 
became the CIA's main target. Work·

z mem. During the war years and be-
yond, 1he number of students attending 
C IA recruitment mee1ings dropped 
steadily. In 1975 - the same year Presi-
dent Ford formed a Senate committee 
to inves1igate 1he legality of CIA ac-
tivities-student pressure forced tht· 
Agency to hold its recruitment mt·elinl{s 
at the Park Plaza Hotel rather than on 
campus.
