About 
200 of Yale's 330 black 
undergraduates pay yearly dues of $30 
to join the Center. The AACC is at the 
center of a web of the University's black 
organizations. It houses the Black 
Church at Yale, the offices for the 
magazine Ritual and Dissent and student 
and non-student groups ranging from 
the Heritage Theater Ensemble to the 
Black Pre-Professional Council to the 
Yale Gospel Choir. On a given night 50 
to 100 people use the Center, and the 
Center's parties are something of a 
legend on campus_. 

Yet in the midst of the AACC's sue· 
cess, some students have argued that a 
separate social center for black students 
at Yale may contribute to racial pro· 
blems while attempting to solve them. 


~~~~~~~~~ The very raison d'ttre of the Afro-
American 
Cultural Center escapes 
white students. After all, the 
Board t?f Education decision to 
public schools became law 30 
this May. Yale is presumably 
most open universities in the 
complete with hardworking 
~""""'"-~"missions recruiters and 
of black and white students

--""'"'"., made great strides here? If 
is the point of the AACC and 
minority organizations like Yale 
, the Asian-American Student's 
""""IR.O'""~~·ation and MeCha? Do these 
segregation 

me people may have been a bit sur-
• for instance, by the appearance 
ast year of Ritual and Dissent, •A Journal 
of Black Arts and Letters." Yale already 
had the Yale Dai!y News (YDN), its 
Magazine, The New Jour1UJ1, Tlte Interna-
tional Forum, Yale Political Montlrly and 
several literary magazines and other 
periodicals. There would seem to be 
plenty of room for black writers and 
issues in the existing campus media. 

Five or six blacks work at the YDN, but 
there are no black staff writers at Tlu 
Nav Jour7UJI and very few anywhere else. 
What's more, complaints about campus 
coverage of black issues have a long 
history at Yale. For example, Ritual tnttl 
Dissent editor Elizabeth Alexander '84 
has strongly criticized the YDN for its 


failure to cover a conference of black 
women writers at Yale in the fall of 
1982. Among the speakers was the 
Pulitzer Prize-winning Alice Walker, · 
author of The Color Purple. 

If coverage of black issues on campus 
has been poor, then why haven't more 
black writers worked within the existing 
publications to fill the gap? Even Alex-
ander is unsure why many black writers 
shy away from mainstream publica-
tions. "Is it after they've submitted 
something and it's been rejected? Is it 
after they've worked with an editor who 
hasn't really understood what they were 
trying to say? Is it just this huge general 
perception that they don't want to write 
for white people? You can't know that. 
For me it's a combination of all three of 
those things and the excitement of 
wanting to do something myself." 

Whatever the reasons for the low 
black profile in Yale publications, Ritual 
and Dissent staff members vigorously 
argue the need for the magazine. 
"There still is a need to address issues 
pertinent to black Americans in a forum 
that is devoted to that end," said AACC 
director Caroline Jackson '74, founder 
of the magazine. "There is a difference 
between just trying to get more black 
students writing, which is a sub-goal, 
and trying to establish a mechanism to 
talk 
about 
black 
issues, 
which 
is 
sornl·thing that no other publication 
should be expected to do." 

The issue of black representation re-
cently raised by Ritual and Dissent t>x-
tends to all areas of black life at Yale 
The question is, how can any predom-
inantly white organization treat black 
issues with the same integrity and depth 
as issues that are of more direct interest 
to whites? Jackson says it is the racism 
permeating all American society which 
"I don't feel that I should be carrying the 
burdens of the past around with me, 
because I think that m eans you're bringing 
them into the future." 
gives rise to institutions like the Afro-
American Cultural Center. "If we ac-
cept the fact that America has been a 
racist and segregated society for more of 
its history than not, then I think one has 
to look carefully at what happens when 
you suddenly introduce large numbers 
of formerly excluded people into an in-
stitution, people who have presumably 
some shared cultural background that is 
in some way distinct from the majority

~ group. Alice Walker said this about go-
~ ing to a white college: 'I found it im-
:t possible 
to go where my mother 
! couldn't come.' She was saying it 
~ metaphorically-'I'm not gonna go 
• alone and chop myself off from 
~ 
., everything else I've known.' The Center 
6 has been a support mechanism for black 
students and it has made sure that cer-
tain cultural activities unique to the 
Afro-American experitnce are present 
on campus for anyone who wants to en-
joy them.'' 

But if Jackson is worried about black 
students being expected to "chop" 
themselves ofT from their cultural pasts, 
others fear that they may be un-
necessarily excluding themselves from 
the activities of their white fellow 
students. Kim Westcott, a black Ezra 
Stiles sophomore from New York, ex-
plained that the reason she has not par-
ticipated much in AACC activities was 
that she fears cutting herself ofT from 
her wide circle of friends. "I feel that the 
Afro-Am Center is really good for 
security reasons: for feeling that you've 
got people who've experienced the same 
kinds of things. You'll know they can 
understand some things that other peo-


pie simply won't. But I also think it's 
easy to fall into a niche. You don't end 
up learning as much and "hitt•s don't 
end up learning as much about vou." 

Letitia Moore, born in the C~ntral 
American nation of Belize but raised in 
Los Angeles, offered other reasons for 
not attending Center activities. "Usual-
ly I don't feel comfortable in a group of 
black people who are espousing how 
black they are and rights for blacks and 
how we've been discriminated a~ainst." 
aid the black Calhoun sophomore. "I 
can relate to it on an intclkuual level. 
but I just don't feel like I've been 
discriminated against. I don't feel that I 
~hould be carrying the burdl·ns of the 
past around with me, because I think 
that means you're bringing it into the 
future. I guess as a result I just make a 
point not to hang around wuh them and 
not to be associated with bc.-ing black at 
Yale.

from Belize. I still have lots ofverv Beli-

values. Just as you have ,,bite races-
Gc.·rman, Scandanavian, whatever-
you have black people from diftercnt 
areas. I don't feel because black people 
have been put down and have suffered 
that I should dassify myself as a black 
person. The human race should stick 
together, shouldn't I><• broken down by 
colo•·." 

Some white <,tudents fear that organ-
izations like the Afro-American Cul-
tural Cemer promote a detrimental 
racial separatism, not by intent but by 
effect. J. B. Schramm. a white Stiles 
sophomore, attended a half-·white, half-
black Denver public -.chool and said 
that integration thc.·n· worked even on a 
social level. "You "ouldn't find a group 
of over five or six JX'ople gathered in the 
school where it wouldn't be interracial." 
He's been disappointed by the segrega-
tion he's found at Yale ... The bigotry 
I've heard here is JUSt «o much stronger 
than at home 
Pn~judi'c is blindness, 
and you can't he.· blind about blacks 
when \'Ou'rc ,,ith thc•m all dav long. I 
think it would be.• worth the t~ubl~ of 
reallv tn.·in'{ w work blacks in rather 
than' sa,·ing. 'OK. we'll give blacks their 
Afro·A·m House -let 'em stav in their 
own neighborhood.'"
