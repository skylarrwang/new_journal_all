are stern and cool. In turn Eaglin 
moves i:>ehind each of them and touches 
his finger to a spot on their backs "Get 
power out of my fingertips," he says. 
The sound of breathing builds. The 
room sounds windswept; it seems va-
cant. "Okay, your hips should be lifting 
as you push." The rhythm of his words 
matches the slow motion of punches 
analyzed through practice. H e guides 
them into a karate-do state of mind. 
"This is not a muscle exercise. When 
you're doing it slow, your mind carries 
it through." His voice ascends to 
another register. It could be speaking 
from above the skylights. "Make your 
punches feel like they're going through 
me. Touch me."

Emotional Healing 
Dr. Bernie Siegel walks briskly towards 
the orange elevator doors. They're not 
opt·n. hut he has faith. At the last possi-
hlt• moment they part, and he steps in-
sick· without lookint:{ up from his chart. 
"That\ the eighth time today," he 
laughs. 

Few men have the right face to support 
" bare <;kull, hut Bernie Siegel, a 
sur~{·on ;11 Yale-New Haven Hospital 
and H bdicver in miracles, is clearly one 
of those men. H is gaze is keen, almost 
pil'r<'ing, but he has even features and 
an t•asy -.mile. His haldness gives him a 
tlwrapt·utit advantage. When he first

f(lr yt·ars '>Uddenly confided their life 
histories to him. Here was a doctor

ofT a leg, producing a physical loss, the 
response is the growth of a new leg. Our 
losses are not physical, but the body 
responds in a physical way- as if it had 
to generate something new. One patient 
told me, 'It's a lack of love. There's a 
space inside of me that's empty, so I 
{{row something to fill it.' T hat space 
can be filled with love. If people grow, 
the cancer doesn't. When patients 
become new people, they don't need the 
old illness." 

H is healing practice is based on lessons 
learned from his parents. From his 
mother, he learned the power of love 
and the will to live: "She was hyper-
thyroid, weighed ninety pounds, and 
was told that if she became pregnant, 
she would most likely die. She found an 
obstetrician who was willing to take a

T here's a space inside of me that's empty, 
so I grow something to fill it.' If people 
grow, the cancer doesn't."

chance with her if she gained thirty 
pounds. Her mother literally fed her on 
a couch for three months until she 
t:{ained the weight. Then she became 
pregnant, had me, and the hyper-
thyroidism disappeared. The message I 
got from that was, 'You can't do 
anything wrong. Your mother's well 
and here you are. You're a gift."' 
From his father he learned the ac-
ceptance of death: "At age 90 plus, my 
father's grandfather told everyone that 
he was going to die that night, and to 
get his friends and a boule of schnapps. 
Of course they humored him. He had 
his party and afterwards went upstairs 
and lay down and died." 
Both his parents are still alive. "I'm 
still somebody's child. That's very im-
portant. It allows me to do a lot of 
things, as a child." 

Graduating from Cornell Medical Col-
ege in 1957 and setting up a surgical 
pra~tice in New H aven, he found it dif-
ficult to harmonize his parents' legacy 
with his new role. "I wasn't trained to 
see m y patients as people. I saw them as 
rlisease, as machines I had to repair. I 
started having a conflict over the life-
saving image. I had to take care of peo-
ple who were d ying, but most of the 
physicians 
who were 
my teachers 
couldn't handle it." They dealt with 
death by denial and a belief in their own 
invulnerability. A nd that's a reason they 
don't often worry about preventive 
medicine. 
"I felt I had to make myself vulner-
able, and begin to learn from my pa-
tients. I redefined my roles. I became at 
different times a healer, teacher, care-
giver or student. My relationship with 
my patients became one of shared re-
sponsibility. People whose lives were 
threatened were able to teach me the 
how and why of living." 

Siegel, an associate professor at the 
medical school,_ decided to set up a 
mutual support group for cancer pa-
tients after attending a 1978 workshop 
on "Psychological Factors, Stress and 
Cancer," which explored the usc of 
meditation and visualization as tools for 
healing cancer. On the first day there 
was;mexercise in which each participant 
was supposed to meet an inner guide. 
"I went into the experience with a 
very negative attitude: I will not meet 
anybody, nothing will appear, noth-
ing's going to happen. Then I thought, 
well, since I'm a surgeon, who else 
would dare appear in my head but Jesus 
or 
Moses? And then along came
