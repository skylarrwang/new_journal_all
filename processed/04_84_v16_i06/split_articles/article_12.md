EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Who wrote this letter? A lot of people 
would like to know, but no one really 
seems to. The authors sign off with the 
cryptic "Yours very truly, Bill and jack 
Elis," and though the letter's postmark 
reads Houston, Texas, the writers do 
seem 10 have a better than long distance 
knowledge' of Yale basketball. 

Instead of getting Brennan sacked, 
however, the letter has had just the op-
posite results, sparking a burst of sup-
port for the ftery coach. Frank Ryan 
called the letter "one of the vilest pieces 
> of defamation I've ever seen," adding 
that it is the.only negative input he has 
l 
received concerning Yale basketball 
since Brennan became coach. Carl Ek, 
Vice-President of the Yale Club of New 
Haven and a recipient of the letter, said 
that the anonymous authors reeked 
with "the stench 
of hypocrisy." 

Giamatti would not comment on the 
letter. 

And Tom Brennan? Busy working 
,on improving his team, he said, "Of 
course it hurts, but I don't have any fear 
of losing my job. I can see how my style 
could offend some people, but it's hard 
to take this seriously when they don't 
sign their names. What can I say? As 
the team gets better, my behavior will 
~et much better. I'm just doing my job."
