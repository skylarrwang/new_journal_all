EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
has a few minutes in the afternoon to sit 
at her kitchen table and recall some of 
the frustrations of union bargaining. 

One night she was forced to choose be-
tween a negotiating session and a long-
standing promise to take her children to 
the Icc Capades. She chose the Ice 
Capades. Negotiations had been taking 
place during the afternoons, time she 
usually spends with her children. "It 
was only fair," she says. 

She laughs. "Here's what happens. 
We sit down. They sit down. They 
usually 
talk 
first. 
They 
propose 
something. They go into another room, 
we talk about it. They come back and 
listen to what we have to say, and then 
their lawyer runs over to 451 College 
Street (the Yale Administration Offices) 
to ask the big boy<; what to do. We 
wait." Eyzaguirre lights a Marlboro. "I 
would call the process cumbersome. I 
also think there is something inherently 
wron~ with proxy negotiations. It seems 
to me that they might understand us 
better if we spoke face to face." 

In general, Eyzaguirre claims to be 
satisfied with the gains made so far. "I 
think we're all 
feeling a 
bit let 
down-actually, I think my children 
were the sorriest that there was no 
strike. They thought they might see me 
more often if I didn't have to go to 
work." Now that negotiations will be 
taking place during work hours, she 
hopes the pace will slow down. "Mom-
my's getting boring," pipes up her 
daughter Claudia. "All she talks about is 
the union." 

Eyzaguirre has to leave. Claudia is 
going with her to Steering Committee. 
As she puts on a raincoat, she relates 
one last anecdote. "Two days ago, after 
we signed the interim contract, a doctor 
who used to work at Yale came into the 
office. I don't think he was pro- or anti-
union or anything. He asked a few 
questions, looked around, and said, 
'Hmmm ... the University had to sign 
a comract with the clerical union.' I 
don't know- to me, that somehow 
summed it up. We're here now."
