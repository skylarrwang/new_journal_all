**Title: Plato Goes Video**
**Author: Joyce BanerJee**
**Page number(s): 8-9**

One sunny afternoon, Socrates and 
Meletus attack each other in a Yale Law 
School classroom. Fists and togas fly· 
ing, they wrestle to the floor. Then the 
camera stops filming, the fighting ends, 
and scene three of Ken Goldstein's 
movie Apology is complete. The motion 
picture, which marks the first use of 
videotape 
in 
the Theater Studies 
department, synthesizes Goldstein's ex· 
perience as a Theater Studies/Philo-
sophy major. 

Goldstein, 
Timothy 
Dwight '84. 
came up with tpe project several yea~ 
ago when enterrng his unique major. 
Initially planning to film Plato's Apolo!J• 
Goldstein later decided to adapt the 
work to college life. "I want to show hoW 
great literature and philosophy affect 
students' 
thinking," he explained. 
"Philosophy becomes viable in people's 
lives but they often abuse the wisdorn 
they find." 

"The Dialectics of Youth," as Apolo~ 
is alternately titled, focuses on four 
students who seek direction and mean· 
ing in their college experience. Senio~ 
pre-med Brett Rosen discovers Socrates 
ideas and haphazardly applies them to 
his own unsatisfying life. In the process 
he loses his girlfriend Michelle Barr>:· 
but gains freshman John Peters as h•s 
friend and protege. Enter Tripp Mar· 
cus III, who dislikes both philosophY 


and Brett. Their enmity-and the 
movie -climaxes in a modern day re-
enactment of Socrates' trial, with Brett 
as Socrates and Tripp as Meletus the 
accuser. 

Though the film is based on classical 
philosophy, Goldstein does not believe 
the material will intimidate an au-
dience. "The movie is 
gear·cd 
anyone, not just philosophy majors," he 
said. "The philosophy is watered down 
to make it understandable." 

Additionally, Goldstein thinks Yalies 
can easily identify with the characters. 
"The students in Apology are all based on 
real observations," he pointed out. "I 
figure everyone at college is either a 
Brett, Michelle, john ot· Tripp. They 
are just the archetypes." 

Goldstein created the characters last 
fall when writing the screenplay, and he 
has devoted spring term to the casting 
and production of the film. In making 
the movie Goldstein uses videotape 
rather than the more widely used 16mm 
film; he believes that video has great 
potential in the performing arts. "There 
is a general snobbery at Yale against 
video," Goldstein said, "because people 
don't consider it to be an art form like 
theater. But they have to realize that 
video is here to stay." 

G oldstein plans a May 3 debut for 
Apology, and he thinks the film should 
be well-received. "It's a student film. We 
have no delusions of grandeur," he said. 
"But a high energy level will definitely 
come across."
