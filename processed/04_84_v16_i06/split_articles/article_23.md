the AACC, Ritual and Dissml, and the 
Black Church at Yale, which seek to 
maintain some of these things that Yale 
as an institution is not necessarily 
designed or fit to do." 

As 
the 
Afro-American Cultural 
Center enters its fifteenth year these 
questions of black identity and the best 
means of remedying the problems of 
racism will continue to be debated. 
"Racial progress presumes that all the 
parties involved will have to acknowledge
the fact that racism still is an 
issue," said Andrews. "Much of our 
community would like to think that 
is no longer true, and that denial in a 
sense impedes any kind of progress. I 
think the more the white students transcend
themselves and look at other 
peoples' concerns and issues, the more 
progress will be made. It is possible, I'm 
sure of that, because we've already seen 
it in reverse. There are black students 
here who know Sartre and Camus and 
all of these guys as well as anybody else. 
I mean, this is part of our culture. This 
is part of the dominant culture. We 
learn the languages. Now this must 
happen in reverse. You see it's very in-
teresting from the standpoint of what a 
black American might say to Camus, 
given the black American's status in this 
country. It's also very important that 
the white American look at those 
aspects of Afro-American culture which 
have their own validity and standing, 
that he might bring to bear whatever he 
might have to say about it. But first of 
all you must do what the black students 
have had to do by necessity, which is to 
transcend their own station. That's very 
important."
