Between the Vines/ Peter Zusi 
Understanding Disaster 
It finally happened: I met the Space 
Shuttle Cynic. I had thought, perhaps 
too audaciously, that even in this 
breeding ground of cynicism called 
Yale, the news of the shuttle explosion 
might escape unscathed. I should have 
known better. I was hanging out at 
Yale Station when the figure emerged 
from his cloud of cigarette smoke and 
approached me. Conversation began 
innocently enough: we exchanged a 
couple of quick wittici;;ms about the 
lighting in the L&B room and then 
progressed into a protracted discussion 
about Christmas vacation. Yet before I 
knew what happened, the word had 
been said. Shuttle. As in Space, that is. 
As in explosion, as in thousands of kids 
watching six 
astronauts and a 
schoolteacher die six miles from Earth. 
"What did you think of the accident?" 
his look seemed to ask me. "It really 
d isturbed me. I was shocked much 
more deeply than I expected to be. 
Yeah, it was really awful." The en-
counter had begun. 

"That's stupid," sneered the Cynic. 
"I think the whole thing has been 
blown out of proportion. What are you, 
patriotic?" This, I realized, was the 
first exchange of what could be a fierce 
battle, and that slowly, point by point, 
the Cynic hoped to reduce my kneejerk 
reaction to rubble. I considered my op-
tions against this first question. Truth 
be known, I don't think I am especially 
patriotic- I feel more allegiance to the 
local bagel store than to the United 
States. When I 
think of modern 
America, tackiness comes to mind: 
3-D movies, big cars with loose-fitting 
chrome parts, or people dressed up in 
Mickey Mouse costumes. American 
Cheese, I've always felt, was a good 
symbol of our country: it's an un-
natural orange color, and it looks like 
plastic. 

"No," I said. 

"Aha! Since you are not disturbed by 
the demise of a patriotic symbol, nor 
upset over the damage to the country's 
image," he said, squinting his eyes, 
"you must be an aficionado of high 
technology." 

H mmm. This one made me think 
hard. I kept trying to conjure up the 
technology in my life and aJI I could 
see was the refrigerator. That started 
to make me hungry. I had to admit to 
myself, 
though, 
that kitchen 
ap-
pliances didn't really count as "high 
technology," and that I had to think of 
something else. 

Backyard satellite 
television 
antennae? 
No. 
Cruise 
missiles? No. I started to tremble at the 
thought of conceding another point, 
but what else could I do? 


"Well, well, well. If you weren't 
disturbed by the glaring failure of 
American technology, nor by the set-
back to future shuttle m issions, could 
it be the deaths which upset you?" 

I saw the trap he had lain. If I said 
yes then I would be open to the reply 
about airline disasters, about how 500 
people 
can 
be 
killed over 
the 
Himalayas and we hardly bat an eye, 
but when seven people are killed over 
Florida everyone gets upset. This was 
not even to mention tidal waves in 
Bangladesh, which have killed over 
20,000 people, or the ongoing suffering 
of people in South Africa or South 
America, or the Bronx. If I answered 
this question with a straight "yes," I 
was bound to be snowballed. 

"In a way but . . . " but I was inter· 
rupted. 

"In a way? What about plane crashes 
which kill 500 people, or mudslides in 
South America which kill 20,000 peo· 
pie, or the ongoing suffering of people 
in Angola, or Nicaragua, or even 
the Bronx. In terms ol human sutler· 
ing the Shuttle accident was a minor 
one. So where does that leave your 
argument now? Why are you so shock-
ed by the incident?" 

"It ... um ... " I replied. 

"Obviously, my friend, you're a 
puppet of the press, responding to the 
size of the type on the front page of The 
New York Times, to the 10 solid pages of 
Shuttle stories in that first issue, and to 
the flood of front page articles which 
have appeared every, day since then. 
Do you really think that's an intelligent 
way to respond to an event? In my 
opinion, 
the whole affair only 
demonstrates bow easily the press 
manipulates the masses. It's really very 
frightening. The Shuttle has gotten far 
too much attention. People are ob· 
sessed with it." Having posited these .
truths, the cynic turned and disap· 
peared behind his cloud of smoke, 
from whence he came. 

So, I had met the Space Shuttle 
Cynic, we battled, and I lost. Lost, I 
thought, in a big way. I walked home, 
feeling like Jello in a dining hall. 
The hallway had little pools of beer 
left over from a party the night before. 
I waded into my room, sat c!own with 
my head in hands, and reconsidered 
myself. Why did I commit myself to a 
viewpoint which I couldn't even de· 
fend? Why didn't I think these issues 
through? Maybe I'm just too young, 
inexperienced, too naive to see clearly 
in 
such 
a 
situation. 
I 
hurled 
deprecating epithets at myself. Unin· 
sightful fool. 
Babe-in-the-woods. 
Sophomore. I felt like an idiot, a 
failure. But then, just as I was indul· 
ging in self-flagellation, my instincts 
for self-preservation kicked in. I was 
sure I had been right. There was
