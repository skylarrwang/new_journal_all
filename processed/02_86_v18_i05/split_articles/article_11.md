**Title:  Joining the Club A History of Jews and Yale**
**Author: Dan A. Oren**
**Page number(s): 19**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
In a unique and richly informative addition to American educational, 
religious, and cultural history, Dan Oren examines the college life of Jews 
at Yale from the first Jewish graduate in 1809 to the present time, drawing 
comparisons to the Jewish experience at other elite colleges and universi-
ties and to the experiences of other minorities at Yale. 

"Oren's scrupulous and highly 
readable survey of an area hitherto 
unexplored in Yale history will be 
illuminating and even instructional 
not only for the Yale family but for 
students of American mores and 
social attitudes in our times."
