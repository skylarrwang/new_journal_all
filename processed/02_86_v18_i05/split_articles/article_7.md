ETC production of Adding Machine. 

Electronic music echoed through the 
auditorium. White gas, spewing from 
under their seats, enveloped the audi-
ence. On stage, large white numbers 
were suspended against a black cur-
tain, and wood stumps popped open 
into flowerbeds of colored balloons. 
Presenting shows such as this 1923 
Elmer Rice drama, 
The Adding 
Machine, The Ensemble Theater Com-
pany (ETC) sees itself as a vanguard 
for small theater. Though it lacks the 
funding to pay any of its artists or to 
construct elaborate sets, ETC produces 
plays that are risky, imaginative, and 
what its directors hope will be a 
refreshing alternative to other theater 
in New Haven. 

Founded last year by Artistic Direc-
tors Kevin Cochran, '83, and Bill 
8 The New J ournal/February 28, 1986 
Ferguson, '83, ETC has already tap-
ped into the audiences that attend the 
Longwharf and Yale 
Repertory 
Theatres. With success that surprises 
even Cochran and Ferguson, ETC has 
sold out every seat for each of its plays 
and already has a loyal following of 250 
season subscribers. 

One reason for the theater's success 
lies in the informal and spirited at-
titude of the ensemble. 
Cochran 
believes that ETC appeals to people by 
offering the fun that larger theaters in 
New Haven lack. "Theater is enter-
tainment," he said. "If you don't relax 
the audience, you'll never affect them." 

Tom Killiam, a drama critic for the 
NtW Haven Register who has seen much 
of their work, agreed. "It's the adven-
ture of the whole thing. Whether au-
~ 
keep• track of finance• in the 
diences like (the play] or not, everyone 
enjoys the experience." 

ETC has performed without a 
theater for most of the season, taking 
its plays instead to different locations 
around New Haven. Inherit the WinJ 
was produced at the Moot Court in tht 
Yale Law School. For Life is a Dream, 
blindfolded audiences were loaded on· 
to a schoolbus and taken to an 
unknown location, to identify with the 
play's protagonist. ETC also plans to 
produce Tommy . . . the Rock Opera at 
Toad's Place, as well as Agnes of God in 
Yale's Dwight Chapel. 

"The use of different locations camt 
about as a happy coincidence of 
historical and aesthetic motivations: 
Ferguson explained. Without the fund· 
ing to establish a permanent home,


ETC has the opportunity to experi-
ment with different ways to involve the 
audience in its plays. "When you take a 
play out of the theater," Ferguson con-
tinued, "you also take away hampering 
conventions." Once the habits of 
"typical" theater, such as where one sits 
and when one applauds, are broken, 
Ferguson believes that the audience's 
experience wiJI be very different. 

non-threatening," Cochran asserted. 
"If they're bored somewhere else, they 
feel stupid. If they're bored here, the 
play just didn't work out." 

ETC's future will depend on its 
special audience appeal. Rather than 
fundraising through government and 
corporate grants like 
most new 
theaters, ETC has chosen to support 
itself solely through ticket sales. With 
The Ensemble Theater Company, undaunted by its lack of a permanent atage, 
produces its plays at a variety of locations in New Haven. Here, Inherit tlu 
Wind is performed at Moot Court at the Yale Law School. 

ETC's artistic directors believe that 
through this experimentation, they 
have successfully created a dynamic 
relationship with their audience. "Thev 
are not alienated by our faults," 
Ferguson explained. "Our faults are 
avenues into the show. At the same 
time, these flaws allow us to get closer 
to the audience." During a perfor-
mance of Th~ Adding Machmt when the 
set got caught in a curtain. the audi-
ence laughed and then applauded. 
Rather than detract from the play, 
such events add to the intimate ex-
perience ETC seeks to create. "We're 
the development of a loyal following, 
ETC can avoid the fate of many ex-
perimental theaters which quickly 
become conservative under the 
pressure of corporate support and 
boards of directors. While ETC has the 
artistic freedom to perform lesser-
produced plays in challenging ways, 
the audience remains Cochran's 
primary reason for sustaining that 
freedom.
