labelling and re-examining his critic<.J 
standpoint, neither was he enthusiastic 
in the late sixties when students began 
demanding a re-examination of the 
role of the university in modern 
America. Rejecting condemnations of 
the university as the institutionalization 
of elite values, Giamatti turned for 
support to the positions of 16th-
century Humanism, just as he had 
always turned to traditional texts for 
clarification of his values and beliefs. 


There he rediscovered classically 
liberal notions of the university and 
education, notions to which he still 
subscribes. 
The University, claims Giamatti, is 
'"a paradoxical creature. You have an 
involved, 
very competitive com-
munity-very competitive by design-
and yet the normal financial incentives 
for competition are absent." Because of 
the absence of self-serving motives, the 
University is a place where people are 
free "for pursuing not one single truth, 
but all the various truths there are, and 
all the new knowledge that there can be 
at the same time as you remember and 
accumulate the old." Competition oc-
curs within this "free market of ideas" 
in a "fruitful, yet joyous and intense 
fashion, and that's the wonderful 
mystery at the heart of the university. 
That people are free, yet they assume 
constraints that keep other people free 
.... , You're really independent when 
you begin to understand the pleasure 
of dependence on others. You don't 
have to be isolated to be independent." 


Giamatti will grant that this is an 
ideal. He won't pretend that his vision 
describes everyday life at Yale. But he 
will defend his positions vehemently, 
and in the early seventies that meant 
attacking anyone who questioned the 
value of education at private institu-
tions like Yale. His writings satirized 
"open" classrooms, New Math, and the 
•individualized instruction" and •eJective 
systems" which produced students who 
emerged "not knowing how to listen to 
anyone else, not knowing how to take a 
direction." He refused to accept the 
prevailing idea that Yale was an elitist 
institution which needed to reorient 
itself in a new political direction. 


Again, Renaissance texts supported his 
arguments. 
"Humanism," he pro-
claimed, "was designed to develop a 
flexible method of inquiry, not a 
preconceived message. Education was 
linked to politics- one was meant to be 
led out into the city-but education 
was not 'politicized.'" 


The sports articles which Giamatti 
wrote during his years as an English 
professor also provide telling evidence 
of Giamatti's attitude towards 
American youth and American values 
during that period of time. His "Tom 
Seaver's .l:'"areweU," which he wrote for 
HOTpers;- praised the Mets pitcher for 
"gaining control over a block of soace 
approximately three feet high, 18 in-
ches wide," while "Yippies yipped, 
flower children blossomed and 
withered." Giamatti wrote that he had 
"no idea what opinions Seaver then 
had on race, politics, war, marijuana, 
and the other ERA, but whatever they 
were, or are, they are beside the point. 
The point is the way Seaver was 
perceived- as clean-cut, larger than 
life, a fastballer, 'straight,' all the time 
when many other young people, who 
were getting lots of newspaper 
coverage, were none of the above." 


In a more blatant attack on anti-
Establishment sentiment, Giamatti 
caricatured one of these "other young 
people" as "outfitted for peace at the 
Army-Navy store with his coded cries 
about relevance and community and 
his roomful of stereos, cameras, and 
electric typewriters, whose deepest 
dream was to bring about the Revolu-
tion and get credit for it." Yet he also 
considered these students a failure on 
the part of American educational in-
stitutions. Liberal arts universities 
had failed to articulate their relation-
ship with society, to clarify their goals 
and purposes. This lapse had resulted 
in the halt of intelligent debate and 
communication, the central focus of 
Giamatti's ideal university. In the early 
seventies, he feared that the intellec-
tual tradition would erode into senti-
mentality. Language had become a 
medium 
for expressing individual 
desire rather than a forum for shaping 
the relationship between the free, ra-
tional individual and society. 


Given these viewpoints, it was no 
surprise when Giamatti, despite his 
"liberal" image, turned out to be a con-
servative president. He simply stuck to 
his principles. Just as he had verbally 
defended the humanistic university 
against radical attacks during the six· 
ties, he continued as president to de-
fend its independence against the more 
concrete intrusions of government, 
unions, the M oral Majority, and the 
remains 
of student activism. 


In 
Giamatti's eyes, his assurance of finan-
cial aid for students denied govern-
ment loans for refusing to register for 
the draft derived from the same princi-
ple which led him to reject binding ar-
bitration during the Local 34 strike. He 
insisted that the Yale G lee Club could 
not sing the Solidarity anthem on the 
Voice of America for the same reason 
that he consistently refused to reveal 
his own opinions on current political or 
social issues. He explains, "I would 
have seen all of those issues as trying to 
be consistent to a 
sense of the 
autonomy of the university, and the 
capacity of the university to manage its 
own affairs." Moreover, he believes 
that neither Yale nor Yale's president 
should associate themselves with a 
single partisan viewpoint. "I think I 
should encourage an environment 
where I can have my judgements and 
you can have yours. I am not obliged 
to satisfy 
everybody's ideological 
labels." 


Even if Bart Giamatti did arrive in the 
office of the Yale presidency with a clear 
mandate from the Corporation a nd his 
own set of classical educational prin-
ciples, he knew it would take time to 
enact them. As he explains it, the 
greatest problem he faced during his 
first years was that "you have to find a 
voice, find a style, fmd a way of ex-
pressing yourself that doesn't presume 
on the one hand to be the innermost 
thoughts o f an extraordinarily 
variegated group of people, many of 
whom will shortly profoundly disagree 
with what you say. But on the other 
hand, your style can't be hedging so 
many .bets and being so cautious as to 
be totally bland a nd inaudible. I didn't 
have an institutional style. I hadn't 
been pre!!ident very long. I was work-
ing on it." 


In the process of finding this voice, 
Giamatti encountered several stumb· 
lin ~r blocks. He found himself con· 
fronted with an immediate change in 
lifestyle, even more abrupt and ex· 
treme than he had expected. "You are 
not doing what you did before. It's a 
different job, and it carries a different 
way of life. That doesn't mean your 
values change, but it certainly changes 
what you do and how you do things. I 
can't go slouching into the Yale Bowl 
and sit in the end zone in my blue jeans 
and workboots on a Saturday the way I 
could when I lived across the street in 
Westville. First of all, I can't sit in the 
end zone. I have to sit where the presi· 
dent sits. What- do you think I could 
move evervthing to the end zone?" 


Giamatti re~embers in particular 
the shock of his first interview, con-
ducted by Sally Quinn of the Wash-
ington Post. "You sit down, and you talk 
to th:s person, and you go home, and 
she prints an article, and what does she 
say? 'H e looks like a Mafioso.' She did. 
She said this. 'He looks like a don, and 
with him is a guy who looks like his 
consigliere.' She had no idea what a 
slur, to use a polite word, that was. If 1 
were a black or a Jew she wouldn't 
have said something that egregious. 


"Not everything's as dramatic or as 
painful as that was. But it was that pro· 
cess of translation from father or Yale 
academic or a guy who writes about 
sports for Harper's to this object which 
has no relation to your self-perception. 
If you decide you're going to be what 
they say, then you're playing with 
them. If you decide the heck with 
them, I'm me- they'U take you apart. 
You make adjustments." 


Even after discounting the shock of 
becoming a public figure so quickly, 
Giamatti's memories of the first two 
years are not particularly cheerful. 
"People would say to me in the first 
year, 'Do you like it?' and I would say, 
'Oh, it's ... fascinating!' People would 
say, 'Are you having fun?' and I'd say, 
'Fun? I'm not sure about having fun . 
Fun?'" Almost immediately, a conflict 
between personal feelings and presi·


dential responsibility arose when his 
first major appointment, Provost Abe 
Goldstein, was revealed to have spent 
some $70,000 of Yale money re-
decorating his university-owned 
house. Shortly after, Goldstein re-
signed. The issue remains so emo-
tionally charged that Giamatti still 
refuses to talk about it. 


Not long after, Giamatti faced a dif-
ferent challenge from Robert Brustein, 
then dean of the Yale Drama School. 
The two quarrelled over a range of 
issues, including how much emphasis 
the school should place on the Yale 
Repertory Theater- Brustein's per-
sonal project-how much on the 
graduate school, and how much on the 
undergraduate Dramat, 
to which 
Giamatti himself had belonged. The 
disagreement swelled into an argu-
ment over how much control the cen-
tral university administration had over 
a department. Brustein ultimately left 
Yale to head the American Repertory 
Theater in Cambridge, but the quarrel 
left Giamatti extremely sensitive about 
future challenges to his authority. 


Giamatti explains, "After all, it's im-
portant to every university president 
that they are able to legitimately take 
the responsibility they are given. This 
is a job with a lot of responsibility, and 
not a whole lot of authority." Giamatti 
had realized that the Yale presidency is 
a position whose prestige and whose of-
ficial power do not necessarily match 
one another. At least, he asserts it to be 
that way. "Power!" he exclaims. "I 
would love to have, in reality, a 
smidgen of what is ascribed." 


In a literal sense, Giamatti is right. 
As Corporation member Maxine 
Singer explained, "When he started as 
President,_1:here were certain customs 
and established practices, certain ex-
pectations about the relation between 
the Corporation and the Yale Presi-
dent which he assumed." The Presi-
dent cannot simply step in and take 
control. For example, the Corporation 
by-laws do give the president the right 
to appoint faculty, 
but accepted 
custom prevents this from happening 
under normal circumstances. The 
president is also technically in charge 
of the budget, yet the burden of its 
specific divisions falls to the Provost. 
The president is 
therefore under


On the President's Image: 
"The Yale community doesn't want 
a president who makes a fool or a 
public spectacle out of himself. 
There may be people who think I 
do, but it's not because I set out to 
do it. But then you don't want some 
shrinking, sad, wizened little 
creature that I claim I am all the 
time. You want to have someone 
you can feel good about when you're 
watching the David Susskind show. 
You don't want to say, 'Oh no, it's 
Giamatti, let's get into the car and 
go to .... Burger King or some-
thing.' Not tlilat you should sit there 
and say' 'Ob my God, rm in awe, 
it's the president of Yale!'" 


On America: "The thing about 
America is that the elite class, 
whatever that means, tends to be 
made by universities, not by in-
herited wealth, standing armies, or 
the state church. One of the reasons 
American culture is so devoted to 
education is that education was the 
way you made yourself into an 
American. That was different from 
the Old Country and I'm sufficient-
ly a patriot to say that it's better. I 
would rather live in a country where 
you didn't have to be born in a fami-
ly that always went to college in 
order to go to coUege.• 


On Poetry: •I think criticism is 
interesting, but I don't think it's as 
interesting as reading a great poem. 
And I don't think it's nearly as in-
teresting as writing a great poem. 
And if I really could have asked the 
Creator to make me in a way that 
would have been interesting, it 
would have been to write poems, 
not to engage in debates about 
whether or not my insight into 
somebody else's insight was creative 
or not.•
