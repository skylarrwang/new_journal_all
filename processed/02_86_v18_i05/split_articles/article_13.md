Growing into Motherhood 
Susan Orenstein 
In 
New H aven, the frequency of 
teenage pregnan1 y has become great 
enough to warrant its own statistic. 
Each year, the c..ny records hundreds of 
new births to teenage girls, ~orne of 
them as young as 13. Once they leave 
the hospital, they wiJJ begin to adjust 
their lives, at school and at home, to 
accomodate the demands of their 
children. Long after the city's books 
are put away each year, teenage 
mothers will continue to encounter 
problems and constraints which 
statistics never reveal. 

The Hill Health Center in New 
Haven reports that, citywide, 449 
teenage girls had children in 1983, the 
most recent year statistics were 
available. While startling, the high 
number of teen mothers in New Haven 
reflects a national problem that has

picture a girl behind a school desk who 
asks, "Do I look like a mother to you?" 
The problem has been considered so 
important by Time that it featured teen 
mothers on a recent December cover. 

For a teenager, a baby alters both 
her body and her personal identity, 
and she finds herself caught between 
school and motherhood. Since many of 
New Haven's teenagers already come 
from a life of inner-city poverty, 
motherhood creates both increased 
financial strain and reasons to drop out 
of school. The city has instituted pro-
grams to help young mothers function 
with their babies and has made ef-
forts aimed at prevem:on, but if the 
number of out-of-wedlock births to 
New Haven teenagers does not 
decrease, teen pregnancy may become 
too commonplace to reverse. 

In New Haven, the best sources for 
insight into the problem are the young 
mothers themselves. Michelle, who is 
18 and lives with her father and step-
mother in New Haven, sat and talked 
one day in school after making up a 
test. Her hands were folded over her 
stomach, and she looked down at them 
when she thought about the baby. "I 
just didn't think I could get pregnant," 
she said. "I was doing good, four whole 
years (without contraception), and 
then I popped up pregnant this year." 

Michelle's belief in her security comes 
naturally to adolescents who don't 
want to worry beyond the present. A

"l just didn't think I 
could get pregnant. I 
was doing good, four 
whole years (without 
contraception), and 
then I popped up 
pregnant this year." 

Federation reports that only one in 
seven adolescents comes to a clinic 
before having sex, and the delay be-
tween first intercourse and first con-
traception 
is usually .six months. 

Michelle found out about her preg-
nancy last August and since then has 
given up her hope to join the Navy. 
Now she plans to go to college part-
time at night but will wait until her 
child is at least one year old. 

In New Haven, teenagers accounted 
for 20 percent of the total number of 
women who gave birth in 1983. Within 
Connecticut, the teen pregnancy rate 
was reported at 10 percent, twice as 
high as national figures. But even at 
five percent, the United States has the 
highest rate in the western world, and 
the only one still rising, according to a 
recent study by the Guttmacher In-
stitute. Reporting on developed coun-
tries, the study cited openness about 
sex as the crucial factor in controlling 
teen pregnancy. For example, in 1975 
Sweden and the United States had 
comparable teen pregnancy rates, but 
since then Sweden has liberalized its 
abortion laws and mandated 
sex 
education, issues still under debate in 
the U.S. Sweden now has a teen 
pregnancy rate less than half that of the 
United States. 

Christine, a 16-year-old at Hillhouse 
High School in New Haven, would 
have benefited from better sex educa-
tion. Part of the problem was how her 
own mother approached the topic of 
sex. "As soon as I got my period," she 
said, "all my mom said was 'You better 
not get pregnant.'" Left at that, such a 
statement ignored crucial issues about 
sex, particularly contraception. 

Though she wanted to avoid having a 
baby, Christine was using birth control 
incorrectly when she became preg-
nant. According to Kathleen London, 
head of a program at Hillhouse for 
school-age parents, a girl may actually 
ask her mother for birth control and 
then go ahead with sex even if her 
mother says no. Living on welfare with 
a daughter 10 months old, Christine 
says that preventing another baby is on her 
mind every day, largely because she 
doesn't think she could withstand 
another 25-hour delivery. 

Recent studies of teen pregnancy 
show that the problem is not limited to 
girls of poverty like Christine. Subur-
ban areas have seen an increase in 
pregnant teenagers, with more girls 
carrying their pregnancies to term. But 
the extremely high rate of pregnancy 
in New Haven indicates that poverty 
makes the problem worse. Dr. James 
P. 
Comer, 
professor of child 
psychiatry at the Yale Medical School, 
believes that a breakdown in the com-
munity accompanied by early ex-
posure to sex causes the teen preg-
nancy rate to rise. Among people who 
are most marginal in any society, such 
as farm women in Europe, the rates 
are highest. According to Comer, New 
Haven suffers because teenagers here 
do not sense they have a chance for 
economic success and lack a reason rot 
to have a child at a young age. 

In fact, in New Haven, many girls 
find numerous reasons w haue babies. 
Michelle thinks some girls are like her, 
arriving at their pregnancies by 
mistake, while some become pregnant 
because their friends do. They either 
see having a baby as a sign of maturity 
or as just something to love. And the 
sight of other girls with babies brings 
the idea home, making it more im-
mediate and plausible. A mother in 
school, 
Sharon looked like any 
appearance-conscious teenager walk-
ing down the hall, her lipstick freshly 
applied even near the end of the day. 
But with a two-year-old son, her time 
is spent taking care of a baby as well as 
herself. Sharon was not using birth 
control when she became pregnant in 
the eighth grade. "The problem with 
girls is they don't have their mother to 
talk to them about sex. I knew I could 
get pregnant but at the time I wanted 
the experience." Aside from curiosity 
about sex, many teenage girls may also 
gain a sense of gratification from 
having a child. In an article he wrote 
for The Crisis magazine, Dr. Comer 
claimed that having a child often com-
pensates for a lack of success in family 
life, school, or employment. 

In his article, Dr. Comer also discussed 
the male motivation behind teen 
pregnancy. "Closed out of an oppor-
tunity for economic adequacy too 
many black males turn to sexu.al con-
quest as a major source of a sense of 
adequacy," he wrote. Evelyn Elliot, 
who graduated from Hillhouse last 
spring with a 15-month-old son, agrees 
with Dr. Comer. She sees how, in her 
community, males will rely on sexual 
prowess and experience to shape their 
self-image. "A lot of girls I know, the 
fathers are around, just around," she 
said. "He likes to say 'yes, this is my 
son,' but when it comes to respon-
sibility he's not there . . . . See, we grow 
up and get more mature because we go 
through the whole nine months. But 
they don't, so they go out and do what 
they were doing. All they realize is 'I 
got a son.' Guys on my street go brag-
ging 'I got three babies.' And other 
ones say 'I hear you, man.'" 

Problems with self-esteem also 
plague the girls themselves, leading 
some into young motherhood. 
Especially when the teenager has been 
physically abused as a child, she may 
get pregnant as a part of her fantasy to 
bring her mother back into her life. 
The most belligerent mothen, London



says, often pay more attention to a girl 
when she is pregnant, and there have 
even 
been "false 
pregnancies" in 
response to severe abuse. 

For such varied reasons, 9,498 
teenagers actually became pregnant in 
Connecticut in 1983, and over half of 
them terminated the pregnancy in 
abortion. London says that despite the 
city's high birth rate there are more 
abortions in New Haven than people 
realize. Manv of these abortions, 
however, occur among girls who either 
later do become teen mothers or who 
already have a child. A recent article in 
Connecticut magazine provided 
evidence suggesting that suburban 
white girls are more likely to have 
abortions than urban blacks. Accor-
ding to Dr. Coll)er, in the lower-income 
urban communities of New Haven, 
seeing other people have early sexual 
experiences and babies creates a com-
munity trend. "Many middle-class 
families are not going to keep your 
baby for you," Dr. Comer said. He added 
that, while low-income communities in 
New Haven have experien-ced a degree 
of deterioration, some families are 
more willing to help raise children 
because it is their only usable skill. At 
Hillhous_e, 
17-year-old Beth is 
sometimes late for school and has to 
start her day at the attendance office. 
She tells the annoyed secretary there 
that she was busy with her daughter 
and came to school as soon as she 
could. Beth says she is fortunate to 
come to school at all, because her 
mother watches her baby during the 
day. In another family, however, 
Sylvia wonders how she will stay in 
school, since her mother, at age 33, 
doesn't necessarily want to watch the 
children while she is in class. In order 
to finish high school, Sylvia meets her 
cousin at 7:45 a.m. to give her the 
baby for the morning, and h~r best 
friend, the baby's godmother, helps 
watch him in the afternoon. 

a 
decision about it, the 12-week 
deadline may preclude abortion, 
unless they are willing to travel to 
Bridgeport or other places outside the 
city. According to London, Yale/New 
Haven Hospital is 
reluctant to 
use medicaid for abortions because it 
receives federal funds and does not 
want to run counter to the current 
administration's policy. Cur-
rently, an effort by Connecticut to 
discontinue state medicaid for abor-
tions is pending decision in court, and 
plans to balance the federal budget 
threaten grants provided to Women's 
Health Services. 

For some girls, whether or not toter-
minate a pregnancy depends not on 
cost considerations but on die moral or 
religious issues surrounding abortion. 
Michelle, for example, said, "I don't 
like abortion 'cause you're killing 
something that's alive. There's no 
reason that I should have gotten an 
abortion. I mean, I could see if I was 
raped." Within her church, a girl faces 
a split in opinion concerning her 
motherhood. Becoming pregnant out-
of-wedlock is viewed as wrong, but go-
ing through with the birth is the right 
decision, and the church will support it 
over an abortion. 

Aside from the potential for family 
support and the example set by teen 
mothers in the community, other fac-
tors often influence a girl's decision to 
have her baby. At an estimated cost of 
$225, affording an abortion is one bar-
rier to terminating a pregnancy. Both 
Planned Parenthood and the Women's 
Health Services, Inc. may perform 
abortions covered by state medicaid, 
though they will provide services only 
through the first 12 weeks of pregnan-
cy. For girls who have trouble accept-
ing their pregnancy, let alone making
