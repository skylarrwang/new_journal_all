**Title: Giamatti's Departure**

Hamlin agrees, saying, "I think that 
the real commttment ne has to educa-
tion and to the humanities has had to 
be put on the back burner in order to 
tend to things like the budget and the 
alumni support, and the buildings and 
grounds, and labor problems. This was 
hardly what he had in mind when he 
came into office." 


To an extent, Giamatti concedes the 
point, saying, "I haven't been able to 
sit here thinking what I can do for the 
humanities- but then 
I 
shouldn't 
have. Of course anybody who's presi-
dent of a university is going to be 
presented with labor problems and 
municipal probl~ms. But I did not 
slack in 
my devotion 
to 
the 
humanities, I have simply increased 
my devotion to the rest of the place." 


Even when Giamatti has been able 
to speak out on educational theory, his 
renowned emphasis on the humanities 
never really embraced the sciences. No 
matter how much money Giamatti 
sank into the renovation ·of science 
facilities, or how much time he spent 
trying to woo prominent scientists to 
the Yale faculty, it was clear that 
Giamatti could not articulate a love for 
the sciences as he could for the 
humanities. 


"From a personal standpoint, I was 
disappointed in his talks which so often 
dealt with the question of liberal edu-
cation," said Singer, a highly-respected 
biologist in addition to being a Cor-
poration member. "I agree with those 
talks as far as they go, yet he didn't in-
clude the sciences in his definition. If I 
were defining a liberal education, I 
would at least include the sciences." 


If Giamatti failed to attend to such 
concerns because more mundane 
troubles kept him too busy, his deci-
sion 
to retire seems somewhat 
mysterious. Why would he choose to 
leave when the strike's end meant the 
first problem-free horizon for Yale 
since Giamatti had become president? 


If there were ever a time when Giamat-
ti could advance his educational agen-
da-and he surely does have one-it is 
now, when Yale is free of the financial 
and labor troubles that occupied so 
much of Giamatti's time in the past. 


There are numerous rumors why 
Giamatti is leaving- to attend to his 
health and his family life, to name 
two- but none of them fully explains 
why a president at the peak of his 
power, having spent more than half his 
life at Yale, would choose to step down. 


The answers are rooted eight years in 
the past, in Giamatti's own mixed feel-
ings about becoming president. 


In 
the sudden transition from 
private to public figure, G iamatti was 
forced to give up P.asttimes he loved. 
The greatest sacrifice was teaching, 
but there were other losses: writing, 
meeting with students, spending time 
in libraries- the day-to-day activities 
of a man in the thick of Yale life, rather 
than distantly above it. Giamatti 
remembers, "I said in my interview 
[with the Corporation] that I was not 
the kind of person .they wanted, and I 
had no interest in being a butcher. I 
didn't see myself as a person who was 
going to slash budgets. I was candid 
about the fact that I wasn't someone 
who I would have thought they would 
have come to." At the time, Giamatti 
predicted that he would only serve as 
president for seven years. 


Publicly, Giamatti reconciled 
himself to his new role. Still, one 
senses that privately he has never been 
completely comfortable trying to be 
president and teacher, administrator 
and educational spokesman all at once. 


That struggle to be the "Renaissance 
Man" has exacted 
a 
tremendous 
physical and personal toll on Giamatti. 


Moreover, he worries that in staying 
longer he risks losing the respect he has 
acquired. 


"I never want to be one of those peo-
ple of whom they're saying in parking 
lots and hallways, 'When's he going to 
go?"' Giamatti says. "Because that's too 
late. And I didn't want to come to a 
point where I had a feeling of defend-
ing what I had done- saying well, yes, 
we had to do all that renovation 
because it was so necessary. Or yes, I 
didn't do that because we were 
rebuilding faculty salaries. Then I 
think the institution slows down. It 
keeps pace with you; it's patient, it 
waits. But the place deserves to keep 
moving at a certain momentum." 


Giamatti says these words with con-
viction. Undoubtedly he thinks it best 
for Yale and himself that he move on, 
but his choices are limited. H e has 


turned down offers to go into politics, 
and he almost certainly will not go into 
business. Being president of another 
university or a foundation would prob-
ably strike Giamatti as redundant or 
anticlimactic. 


In truth, there are surprisingly few 
options for a former president of Yale, 
especially one who is as proud as 
Giamatti. Other presidents have 
retired after leaving office, 
and 
presidents have 
died in 
office. 
Kingman Brewster is now master of an 
Oxford college. But Giamatti is far 
younger than all of them were, and 
even he doesn't seem to know what the 
job market holds for ex-Yale 
presidents. 


Of course, Giamatti has spent the 
majority of his life as an academic, and 
many faculty members have told him 
they would like to see him return to 
Yale 
to teach again. 
Giamatti, 
however, 
is pessimistic about the 
possibility. There are enemies made 
over the years to consider, the problem 
of catching up with a decade's worth of 
scholarship, the difficulty of downshift-
ing 
from president to 
faculty 
member, and the awkwardness his 
presence at Yale might mean to 
President-designate Benno Schmidt. 


For a man who loves Yale as much as 
Giamatti does, such a threatened 
separation is more like exile. Giamatti 
can't help but be aware of how ironic it 
is for a president who has always 
stressed the importance of choice at 
Yale to find that he has little choice but 
to leave Yale, never to return except as 
a visitor. 


"I've been here about as long as I 
thought I should be," Giamatti says 
softly. "You should know when enough 
is enough. You should do it just for the 
sheer joy of doing it, because the place 
deserves better than just repetition." 


He pauses. "Then let somebody else 
do it. This isn't my career. I mean, I 
do like it. I used to get asked that ques-
tion five, six, seven years ago, and I 
wasn't so sure. Now, if you say to me, 
'Are you having fun?' I'd say, 'Yes. I 
enjoy the job.' And I will miss it.•
