teenagers m New Haven will have 
their babies, the city responded 20 
years ago with the opening of an alter-
native school for pregnant girls. The 
school has recently changed locations, 
and on a trip down Columbus Avenue, 
a billboard gives the first welcome to 
the neighborhood, its bold black letters 
reading "Having a Baby? We Deliver!" 
The Polly T. McCabe building, identi-
fied by a hand-written sign in the win-
dow, 
is 
school 
for hundreds of 
teenagers each year. Within the school 
system, Polly McCabe receives about 
90 percent of the city's pregnant girls, 
the official count last year being 211. 
Most of them black or Hispanic, their 
ages range from 12 to 20, or from si.xth 
to 12th grade. 

A key purpose of McCabe is to make 
the pregnant teen feel ~omfortable by 
offering her the company of others in 
the same situation. The entrance to the 
school has a round table that serves as 
a student lounge, and in between 
classes pregnant girls gather there, 
talking and laughing together. Mc-
Cabe seeks to help students not only 
socially but educationally, and the sub-
jects written on the classroom doors 
resemble those of other schools: social 
studies, English, home economics. 
路 The program aims at keeping girls in 
school throughout their pregnancy, so 
that they can either graduate or con-
tinue In regular schools such as 
Hillhouse. 

For -Michelle, attending McCabe 
this year will mean a high school 
diploma as well as something equally 
vital: lessons in mothering. "I'm scared 
... 'cause I don't know nothing about 
babies," she said. "I'm scared I might 
get up in the middle of the night and be 
angry for getting up." When she first 
found out she was pregnant, Michelle 
also feared the pain of childbirth. To 
help prepare for labor, she takes a class 
at McCabe on childbirth and health 
that meets twice a week. The room is 
also used for delivery exercises, so on 
those days it is empty of desks and

teenagers about preventing pregnancy. 
chairs. More than the open space, the 
posters on the walls show that the 
classroom is far from ordinary. One 
presenting a series of pictures is called 
"Stages of Labor," and another, on the 
other side of the room, reads "How a 
Baby Grows." 

Michelle says she feels more in-
volved with school now than before her 
pregnancy, and one reason could be 
the personally important issues she en-
counters in class. Taught by Adair Lu-
ciani, "Childbirth and Health" deals 
w1th delivery, nutritional information, 
birth control, and family dynamics. 
Ironically, Luciani finds that the girls 
in her classroom are in many ways 
naive. "The swingers know enough to 
use birth control," she said. "The ones 
who get pregnant are the innocents." 
Michelle, not realizing she could get 
pregnant after four years of sex 
without birth control, is an example of 
such innocence. Her face is covered 
with freckles, making her protruding 
stomach incongruous with her youth. 
She realized she was pregnant when 
she called her mother after being sick 
for a while. "We just took it as a joke, I 
guess, I don't know. She didn't yell, 
she didn't get mad or nothing. She 
said, 'If you throw up phlegm then 
you're pregnant.' I was throwing up, 
and my mother said 'I guess I'll be a 
grandmother.'" 

As soon as she delivers her baby, 
Michelle will face difficulties that Lu-
ciani's class may not have prepared her 
for. After having people worry about路 
her while pregnant, she will start wor-
rying about her own baby. And her 
goals to finish school and get a job will 
become more difficult than she im-
agined. She will already break the pat-
tern of 50 to 85 percent of teenage 
mothers nationwide by finishing high 
school. Going on to college would be 
exceptional, as well as draining. 

Addressing the problem of high 
dropout rates among young mothers, 
Lee High School in New Haven in-
twduced a program eight years ago 
designed to keep teenage parents in 
school. Today, all three high schools in 
New Haven have programs, but only 
Hillhouse employs a teacher full time. 
London, who ran 
the 
program's 
original model, is currently the teacher 
at Hillhouse. Having formerly worked 
at McCabe, she believes the hardest 
work for young mothers comes after 
the baby is born. London believes that 
many of the 111 students enrolled in 
her program this year find that they 


are separated from other girls in 
school. "I do think some of the other 
girls view it sadly as a loss of their 
teenage friends, and it is," she said. 
"But I don't think they pass moral 
judgment at all." 

Still, the student mother recognizes 
the split in what she deals with at home 
and at school all in the same day. "I'm 
still a teenager," Beth said defiantly. "I 
don't have to be grown. I don't have to 
cut my fun out because I'm still young. 
I'm notgoingto play the grown role yet 
. . . but I like being around older peo-
ple. Young girls, they act too silly. You 
know, smart remarks about the baby." 

Before she comes to school, Beth gets 
up at 5:30 or six a.m., checks on the 
baby and changes her. She wishes she 
could take care of her daughter during 
the day, and she also wishes she could 
earn her own money. Beth sees her 
younger sister, who is pregnant now, 
as a source of conflict, not as someone 
following her own lead. With two 
babies in the family, Beth thinks she 
won't have as much money allotted to 
her as before. 

Sharon, who helped 路 others with 
their babies before becoming a mother, 
thinks she was ready for the respon-
sibility. Separation from peers does not 
concern her, because most of her 
friends now have babies. Even though 
having a child out-of-wedlock trapped 
Sharon and other teenagers into pover-
ty, their motherhood serves to bring 
them together. She wishes she could 
have had her own son when she wasn't 
a student, but her friends provide the 
emotional support which makes 
motherhood bearable. Still,- among her 
friends with babies, Sharon does feel 
distanced from the ones who don't stay in 
school and says they use motherhood as 
an excuse to drop out. 

Young mothers in New Haven face 
alienation because school is designed 
for teenagers who do not have to worry 
about dependent children. Trying to 
be both students and mothers, teenage 
girls may feel successful as neither. In


order to resolve the conflict, they may 
choose a single identity and abandon 
school because motherhood comes 
first . Remarkably, New Haven has a 
drop-out rate for teen mothers of only 
18 percent, a figure far below the na-
tional average. The city's school-age 
parents' program plays a major role in 
keeping young mothers in school 
because it removes them from an 
alienating environment for one period 
each day. Everything in London's 
room, for example, speaks directly to 
them. A table in the corner is covered 
wtth pamphlets that include informa-
tion on, among other things, birth con-
trol, drinking and pregnancy, men and 
sex, and sexually transmitted diseases. 
Across the room from the pamphlets, a 
bulletin board displays pictures of 
babies born to London's students. 

Along with troubles at school, teen 
mothers often must face 
difficult 
choices within their own homes. One 
of the concerns that differs from 
mother to mother is the specific finan-
cial situation of her family and the way 
she supports her baby. Rules govern-
ing state aid are confusing, even in-
timidating, and teenagers may not 
understand what is available to them. 
London will call and even visit the 
welfare office and then explain the in-
formation to her students. Currently, a 
major problem for young mothers is 
that they do not receive the welfare 
award for their babies while living at 
home. In late 1984, the state transfer-
red responsibility for the babies to the 
maternal and paternal grandparents, 
so that they receive the added award 
instead of the mothers. The new policy 
seeks to make parents more respon-
sible 
for 
their teenagers' sexual 
behavior, but it has the adverse effect路 
of leading young mothers out on their: 
own. Some of them are genuinely 
more responsible than their parents 
and feel a great need to control the 
baby's funds. But to do so, they must 
declare their independence, and many 
will move out only to face increased 
poverty. London says some young 
mothers end up with no place to live as 
a result of the new policy, and others 
may resort to lying to evade the law. 

Christine is one young mother in 
New H aven who moved out of her 
house so that she could receive welfare 
compensation for her baby directly. 
Though she says she hates being "on 
state," Christine 
became too 
frustrated living with her mother. 
"When my mother was getting my 
money, I wasn't getting anything at all. 
I wish I could move back and still get 
it," she said. With her own apartment 
near her mother's house; Christine 
comes home from school and confronts 
the tasks of running a household. Plan-
ning her monthly budget, she always 
sets aside enough for two spare boxes 
of Pampers. "Mrs. London's class is 
the only reason I come to school," 
Christine said. "Otherwise I would 

For Sylvia, life in her mother's house 
has also proved difficult, and she plans 
to move out soon. Finishing out the 
year at Polly McCabe, her son just 
three months old, Sylvia talked while 
her two-year-old daughter fell asleep 
on her lap. The baby, holding ~nto her 
mother's shirt, had two braids fastened 
with Raggedy 
Ann 
barettes, 
braiding part of her mother's daily 
routine. Sylvia says her own mother, 
who became a single parent when she 
was 15, challenges her role with the 
children. "I can't feed my son when I 
want," Sylvia said. "I can't change 
him when I want. There's a certain 
time I can play with my child." 
certain time I can play with my child." 
Her mother gives her $140 a month to 
live on and also pays for her food, but 
Sylvia plans to receive S500 a month 
paying a low rent at her aunt's house. 
Sylvia finds that most of her friends 
from 
high 
currently 
have 
babies, and she knows of only one who 
is married. For most young mothers, 
marriage does not coincide with hav-
ing a baby, and the ones who do re-
main with their baby's father often feel 
unusual. Although she has a new 
boyfriend, Sylvia considers her 
children the most important part of her 
life, and she wants to go to college and 
open a home for young mothers. Col-
lege is a way for her to escape a 
dependence on welfare, and she is 
eager both to support herself and to get 
married. "I'd like to be married but 
there ain't no boy dumb enough to 
marry someone with two kids already," 
she said. She would have married her 
babies' father, but speaking of him now 
brings her noticeable pain. With a 
disillusioned outlook on men, she says 
they are like little children even though 
they can be fathers. She finds it painful 
to answer her daughter's questions 
about her father anr:l think-: abo11t pro-
tecting her son from his example. 

Evelyn, with a two-year-old son, 
went through different stages of emo-
tions regarding her baby's father. "I felt 
like at first I didn't want my baby's 
father to have anything to do with me 
and my baby," she said. "Then I felt 
selfish, like I should let him be with his 
child. Then I felt like maybe I rushed 
him. But he's never around. I don't 
think he deserves this baby. Guys get 
what they want, then they leave. This 
isn't what I wanted in him. The love 
that you thought you had is gone." 

Currently, her son's father has another 
baby, born to the teenager who lives 
next door to Evelyn. Evelyn feels 
resentful when he will not help take 
care of her baby and then goes into the 
house next door. She says she knows a 
number of young mothers who receive 
financial 
help from 
their babies' 
fathers, but most of the love and emo-
