"The constitution of 
Yale is a constitutional 
monarchy, but one in 
which the king is 
crucial. And the 
president is king." 
10 The New JournaVFebruary 28, 1986 
On a Saturday in 1978, the Yale Corporation interviewed A. Bartlett 
Giamatti. On Sunday they asked him to be president of Yale, and on 
Monday, Giamatti accepted. Not long after, he became the victim of 
a recurring nightmare. 

"I was in a huge airplane hangar, an immense structure, larger than 
I could define the limits of," he remembers. "There was a puzzle in 
there, one of those huge puzzles, and I wasn't even sure I knew where 
all the pieces were. I knew I didn't know where all the pieces were." 

Giamatti's qualms about his nearly overnight transformation from 
English professor to Yale president didn't affect his emerging public 
image. The press loved Bart Giamatti then and has ever since. He was 
articulate, outspoken, and president of Yale, more than enough to 
make colorful reading. He looked different from most college 
presidents. In those early days, he was described over and over again 
as a "Renaissance Man," a student of Machiavelli and Dante who 
walked around campus wearing work boots and a battered Red Sox 
cap. His family car was an aging Volkswagen Bug. I-te had a sense of 
humor; this was the man who once said that the only thing he had 
ever wanted to be was president of baseball's American League. And 
he represented a break from tradition- Yale's first "ethnic" president. 

After eight years, the hoopla surrounding Giamatti's ascendence to 
the Yale presidency has given way to more realistic, if sometimes con· 
flicting, perceptions of his beliefs and principles. Now he is difficult to 
label. The same people who hailed him as a great liberal after he 
blasted the Moral Majority· in a speech to the freshmen felt betrayed 
when he took an obviously sincere hard-line stance during the strike, 
refusing to consent to binding arbitration. On the other hand, the Old 
Blues who applauded when he announced in his Inaugural Address 
that the University should be a place of "civilized order" and a "stan-
dard in times of uncertainty and disaffection" surely grimaced when 
he declared his belief that no money or effort should be spent on 
athletic recruiting. And although it's hard to find many people within 
the administration who will say anything negative about him, grumb-
ling students and faculty members accuse him of having grown stale 
and of lacking innovative ideas. 

Giamatti takes these accusations as a part of the job. "If people like 
what you do, you're a shining moral light. And if they don't like what 
you do, while you think you're doing the same thing in a different con-
text, then you're a retrograde oppressor of everybody. All I want to do 
is to be consistent with my perception of my principles." 

ButGiamatti'sprinciplesdid notinstantlyemerge when he became pres-
ident, nor have they always been clear to the Yale community. To under-
stand his presidency, it's critical to understand his principles, for they have 


always dictated his actions as presi-
dent. They derive from his devotion to 
Yale as an institution, his Renaissance. 
scholarship, and his experiences as a 
teacher at Yale during the late sixties 
and early seventies. 

In a series of interviews over the past 
several weeks, Giamatti discussed the 
origins of his principles, how they have 
shaped Yale, and how he acquired the 
authority to apply them. 

Talking with Giamatti, one can't 
help but notice how much older he 
looks than he did when he first became 
president. He has gained weight; 
wrinkles and deep bags line his face 
and eyes. He smokes heavily, in the 
hungry manner of someone who en-
joys smoking too much even to con-
sider quitting. There is no more black 
in his once-raven beard. But Giamatti 
has lost none of the verbal and mental 
dexterity that made him such an at-
tractive candidate for the presidency in 
1978. Why did he decide to talk now? 
"Because it's the end," he explains. 
"Because in a funny way you want it 
said." 

The entry for Angelo Bartlett Giamatti 
in the Class of'60 yearbook reads like a 
list of Yale social clubs: the Dramat, 
Pundits, the Elizabethan Club, Delta 
Kappa Epsilon, Aurelian, Scroll and 
Key. He joined almost as many com-
mittees: 
Charities Drive, 
Under-
graduate Affairs Committee, Senior 
Advisory Board, Class Day Orator, 
Saybrook College Council. Giamatti 
was a Yale man to the core. He had the 
family heritage- his father, a professor 
of Italian, was class of'32-and he had 
been "prepared," as the yearbook put 
it, at Andover. 

Giamatti was both well-liked and 
well-known. According to University 
Secretary John Wilkinson, a classmate 
of Giamatti's, "After six months every-
one knew who he was. He was just a 
powerful 
personality. 
He was 
dramatic. He always wore a trench-
coat, always wore dark glasses, always 
walked around with a cigarette hang-
ing out of his mouth. He was sort of in 
a Humphrey Bogart phase." 

Giamatti's enthusiasm and admira-
tion for Yale institutions didn't end 
with his undergraduate days. Cyrus 
Hamlin, one of Giamatti's graduate


classmates in Comparative 
Literature and later a fellow Yale pro-
fessor, recalls a time when the two 
were playing a Whiffenpoof record. 
"When it came to the Whiffenpoof 
song, Bart insisted that no one speak. 
It was that kind of intensity." In fact, 
Giamatti has spent only two years of 
his adult life away from Yale, teaching 
at Princeton after he received his 
Ph.D. in 1964. He then returned in 
1966 and became a full professor 
within five years. At age 33, he was 
one of the youngest scholars ever to be 
granted tenure in the Yale English 
department. 

Giamatti's respect for the sanctity of 
institutions extended beyond his devo-
tion to Yale. As a scholar, Giamatti 
never pretended to be anything other 
than a traditionalist. Even at a universi-
ty world-famous for its avant-garde 
critics, the home of the "Yale School~ 
and deconstructionism, he remained a 
staunch advocate of traditional notions 
of reading and interpretation. Today, 
Giamatti freely expresses his distaste 
for "people who wish to have it thought 
that everything we teach is a structure 
of the political and economic systeJll 
we come out of." The point of scholar-
ship, he feels, is to elucidate texts, to 
"show what they meant, then implicitly 
or explicitly evaluate them against 
some notion of what was good and 
what wasn't." The importance of the 
original statement of the poet exceeds 
the value of issues like the examination 
of the social role of the critic or un· 
earthing the implied ethical values of 
the literary canon.
