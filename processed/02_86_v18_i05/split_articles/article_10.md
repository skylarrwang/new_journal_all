unavoidable financial 
constraints. 

Finally, he is without any guarantee 
that in most cases his advice will be 
obeyed, especially by the faculty, 
which guards its independence fiercely. 
Aside from his ceremonial func-
tions, his only official task is to make 
appointments such as university of-
ficers, deans, masters, and department 
chairpersons. All of these appoint-
ments are made through an extensive 
committee process, and again the 
president is obliged by custom to heed 
their advice. 

There is, however, another side to 
the coin. As History Professor Donald 
Kagan puts it, Giamatti's willingness 
to deprecate his own power is "part of 
Bart's shrewdness and wisdom. That's 
one of the first requirements of a presi-
dent, to say that. But my own opinion 
after watching Yale for 17 years is that 
the constitution of Yale is a constitu-
tional monarchy, but one in which the 
king is crucial. And the president is 
king." Giamatti may not have many 
officially designated tasks, but as 
Kagan points out, "When the presi-
dent, as the symbol of the university, 
comes to people and says, 'Look, I 
need your help,' you know what they'd 
do? They'd say 'yes.'" 

Giamatti is not unaware of this 
aspect of his job. He explains, "Power 
is essentially a 
function, to which Â· 
everyone subscribes. And if it is ascrib-
ed to you, even if you don't have it, 
you do have it." For Giamatti, wielding 
power at Yale is like conducting a sym-
phony orchestra. "If the orchestra 
decides they're not going to look at the 
conductor, then they're not going to do 
it. But if they decide to look at the con-
ductor and they trust him, then they 
may not like it all the time, but they'll 
follow him." The Yale president, like 
an orchestra conductor, must convince 
people to trust him if he wants to maintain 
his authority. After overcoming 
some initial insecurity and challenges 
to his authority, Giamatti seems to 
have obtained this trust. And with the 
respect of the Yale community comes 
an immense amount of what he calls 
"the power of suasion, the power to 
persuade." 

Giamatti attributes the success of his 
administration to his sense of self-
preservation, saying, "I don't mean


"I never want to be 
one of those people of 
whom they're saying 
in parking lots and 
hallways, 'When's he 
going to go?'" 

self-preservation in a physical literal 
sense of the word, I mean politically 
viable. And I mean politically in the 
best and largest sense of the word, try-
ing to involve a polity, create a com-
munity. To that extent you do not 
engage in acts that are designed to lose 
the goodwill that you must draw upon 
when something you're trying to do 
needs to be done. I can't say, 'You're 
going to be Master of X, you're going 
to be Chairman of Y, and you're going 
to be Director of Z.' People do not have 
to obey." Instead, Giamatti relies on 
his humility. "I paint myself as this 
besieged, weak creature trying to get 
through the day-the Wimp of Woodbridge 
Hall. It is not ineffective." 

But Giamatti's persuasive talents ex-
tend beyond simple self-preservation. 
Kagan attributes Giamatti's success 
with people to his sincere devotion to 
the institution. "You can't say no, 
because you know he means it, you 
know that he cares, you know that he's 
not a distant figure who is them, rather 
than us." Director of Athletics Frank 
Ryan adds, "You have to realize that 
there's nobody who doesn't like Bart 
Giamatti. People like him because he 
likes them. He's the mouth for their 
own emotions and feelings. He can 
converse with the common man." 

In short, Giamatti's ability to exer-
cise power as Yale president is inseparable 
from, even dependent upon 
the power of his personality. Not 
everyone feels this style of leadership is 
always appropriate. Comments 
Wilkinson, "Giamatti doesn't walk on 
water. He can be tempestuous, dif-
ficult, cranky. And he's called some 
things wrong, stylistically, maybe said 
the right thing the wrong way. On oc-
casion the very force and power of his 
personality have been such that there 
were people who felt that they weren't 
really heard." 

Critics also challenge Giamatti's 
sincerity, pointing to his ability to 
charm with personality if he can't con-
vince with facts. 
More than one 
observer has invoked Giamatti's 
undergraduate acting career as proof 
that the president can play whatever 
role a 
situation demands. 
One 
Literature professor compared 
Giamatti 
to 
Prince 
Hal 
in 
Shakespeare's Henry V, emphasizing 
Hal's transformation from a fun-loving 
inhabitant of the "tavern world" to the 
aloof and manipulative King Henry V. 

If Giamatti has taken advantage of 
his strong personality to 
wield 
presidential power more effectively, he 
has also paid a personal price for it. 
When the power of the president 
depends on the individual's strength of 
personality rather than written codes, 
the president becomes a ripe target for 
those who wish to attack the institu-
tion. During the 1984 strike, for in-
stance, Local 34 ridiculed Giamatti by 
printing and selling "Bartbuster" 
t-shirts and chanting anti-Giamatti 
manifestos. The union's strategy was 
to discredit the position of the Yale ad-
ministration by discrediting Giamatti. 

"No human being enjoys having to 
have a bodyguard to walk around on 
campus," Giamatti says today, almost 
certainly with more stoicism than he 
could manage at the time. "No human 
being enjoys having his family sub-
jected to the kinds of things mine were. 
No human being enjoys being called 
those names and being held up to con-
tempt and ridicule. But no human 
being who confronts that and then 
changes all of his beliefs about what the 
place stands for and how money is 
allocated would be worth very much." 

Despite his reliance on style, 
Giamatti will probably be remembered 
in substantive terms as the president 
who balanced the books at Yale. That 
was Giamatti's first priority when he 
became president, and he has succeeded 
in eliminating the Yale deficit- for 
years a multi-million dollar embar-
rassment- and helped almost triple 
Yale's endowment. That achievement, 
along with his well-publicized attention 
to alumni relations, Yale-New Haven 
relations, boosting faculty salaries, and 
restoring campus buildings, has given 
his presidency a "housekeeping" flavor.
