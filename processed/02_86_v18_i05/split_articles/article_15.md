tional support go out of the relation-
ship. Her own son calls his father by 
his first name since he knows him more 
in the caoacity of friend than of "Dad-
dy." 

Throughout New Haven, 
many 
young mothers expect that, for the 
time being at least, they will live on 
their own. Though many of them cur-
rently have boyfriends, these men are not 
necessarily 
expected 
to 
become 
husbands. Beth, who is still together 
with her baby's father, doesn't think he 
will be the ma n she will marry. "You 
can't expect to stay with your baby's 
father 
forever," she said, "because 
pretty soon he'll break loose. H e don't 
want no woman with babies all the 
time." Michelle, who has watched her 
parents, her brother and her friend all 
suffer troubled marriages and separa-
tions, has turned down her boyfriend's 
proposal. "I don't want to get m arried," 
she said. "I did, but I don't want to 
now. H e got the ring, but I told him I 
didn't want it. Marriage, that's a scary 
word because then they feel that they 
own you. They got papers saying 
you're his or whatever. You can't just 
go your way and he go his way." 

Though Michelle's outlook is sober-
ing, current statistics show that her 
chances for a successful marriage are 
not very good . A task force on teen 
pregnancy in Connecticut reported 
that marital disruption within 15 years 
is three times more likely for women 
who become mothers between the ages 
of 14 and 17 than for those who wait 
until after they are 20. For women 
becoming mothers at ages 18 or 19, the 
likelihood for disruption is two times as 
great. Aside from a troubled marriage, 
poverty is also more likely for a 
teenage mother. Families headed by 
young mothers are seven times more 
likely to live in poverty, and in 1984, 
58 percent of Connecticut's Aid to 
Families with Dependent Children 
(AFDC), or welfare, went to women 
who were teen mothers. 

The figures for children born to 
young mothers are equally troubling. 
Teenagers are twice as likely to have 
low birth-weight babies than mothers 
who are ages 20 to 24, and in 1983 
New Haven's infant mortality rate was 
23 deaths per 1,000 live births. This 
figure was more than double the state 
rate of 10.1 and the national rate of 
11.5. In addition, New H aven had a 
nine percent rate of low birth-weight as 
compared to the state's 6.4 percent and 
the U.S.'s 6.8 percent. According to 
Bob Kilpatrick at the Hill H ealth 
Center, being both poor and a teen-
ager automatically places a young 
mother in higher risk of having a baby 
who is below weight or unable to sur-
vive. H e cites problems such as low in-
come, language and cultural barriers, 
lack of transportation, and fear of 
medical a id as some reasons why 
young mothers do not receive better 
prenatal care. 

The generation of babies being born 
to black teen mothers faces other 
disturbing predictions. The Children's 
Defense Fund in W ashington, D.C. 
wrote in 1985 that "Our principal con-
elusion is that black children are 
sliding backwards." The report also 
says that black teenage girls are three 
times as likely to die during childbirth. 
Babies of black teen mothers are four 
times as likely to live with neither 
parent and be supervised by child 
welfare and five times as likely to be 
dependent on welfare and becom e 
pregnant as teens. For New Haven, 
such predictions give a grim outlook 
for the future, since nearly 20 percent 
of the female school population has 
children each year. 

In searching for a solution to New 
Haven's problem, Comer says it is dif-
ficult for teenagers to break away from 
community trends because the com-
munity provides their base of emo-
tional support. A large ' gap exists be-
tween the immediate environment in 
which m any teenagers have children 
and the outside community that is 
more ready to reject such a practice. 
Comer suggests the idea of "bridge 
people," such as church leaders or 
teachers, who work from within the 
community to provide mainstream at-
titudes, values, and skills. To aid 
teenagers in New Haven who need a 
strong academic program that will 
motivate them towards jobs, Comer is 
currently working at Hillhouse to 
develop the curriculum and address 
health issues, including teen pregnan-
cy. London believes that fathers should 
also have increased opportunity for 
vocational training. "They feel they 
should be fmancially responsible, and 
yet they are for the most part unable," 
London said. 

Young mothers in New Haven, 
recognizing that teen pregnancy is a 
problem, do not know how to change 
it. Beth said, "Everybody you know is 
pregnant. And it's sad too 'cause there's 
nothing you 
can do 
for 
them." 
Christine, shaking her head, added, 
"Best thing I could tell them is to take 
the pill every day." Thinking for a mo-
ment, she expanded her advice. "Tell 
them how hard it is," she said. "If you


---

do have sex, make sure you have 
double protection." Hoping to tell 
teenage girls how hard it is before they 
get pregnant is one of the objectives of 
a newly formed project in New Haven 
called Helping Others Win. Founded 
by Evelyn Elliot last spring, the pro-
gram originally called for visiting the 
elderly in convalescent homes and then 
began discussing sex and pregnancy 
with teenagers. Elliot and her partner 
in the organization, Dinah Milton, 
also try to encourage young mothers to 
remain in school after giving birth. "At 
graduation , we felt like we should've 
been respected more highly than any-
one else because we had children. I felt 
like I was gonna burst and cry and do 
everything at the same time," Elliot 
said. She and Milton have been 
visiting classrooms since last year but 
ultimately want to open an office 
where teenagers won't be afraid to talk. 

Another independent program, Life 
H aven Inc., plans to open a shelter for 
pregnant teenagers and mothers in the 
greater New H aven area to provide 
housing, counseling, and follow-up 
work. T he project has aiready received 
50 requests for help, though it will ac-
commodate only 12 girls at once when it 
opens this summer. 

Meanwhile, New Haven's city-run 
programs continue to provide some 
essential services. Connecticut magazine 
last May reported that London's 
school-age parents program has re-
duced the number of young mothers 
who become pregnant a second time 
within two years to eight percent, com-
pared to 60 percent nationwide, and it



has also helped to keep young mothers 
in school. At Yale, several researchers, 
headed by Vicky Seitz in the Child 
Studies Center, have interviewed 145 
young mothers since 1981. Their re-
sults show that mothers who attend 
McCabe go on to have increased 
educational success, 
as 
well 
healthier babies. 

Despite their positive effects, New 
H aven's programs do not reach the 
core of the city's teen pregnancy prob-
lem. 
Teenagers isolated 
from 
economic opportunity will not find. 
compelling reasons to avoid having 
children, and their futures will be d ic-
tated by adjustments to motherhood 
instead of academic or career goals. 
Daily, such young women will face 
questions concerning their child's 
welfare, the possib ility of dropping 
out, and the sufficiency of their AFDC 
check. Some believe, however, that 
they can attain a future apart from 
these problems, perhaps one of securi-
ty. "In five years," Beth said, "I hope to 
be in my last year of college, finding 
me a good nursing job. I want one 
more baby, I want to be married." 
T hen, smiling a bit, she said what she 
really wanted: "I want to go to Europe. 
I want a fresh start and take my family 
with me and be happy."
