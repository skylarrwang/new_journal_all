nothing wrong with being upset by the 
crash. I had just been caught off-
guard and couldn't justify my re-
action; I needed to think it through 
more thoroughly. 

Why did I have such a strong re-
action to the shuttle accident? The 
more I thought about it, the more dif-
ficult it was to explain. Maybe it had 
something to do with my age, with how 
I grew up relative to the space pro-
gram. I was too young to remember 
the moon landing, but one of my 
earliest memories is of a T .V. set up in 
our kitchen, showing a cloudy image 
which my parents told me was a 
rocket. On the same screen, but years 
later, I watched the Apollo-Soyuz 
hook-up. Through high school, I saw 
the shuttle develop from preliminary 
drawings published in magazines to 
live footage on the T .V. They even 
named the protot1·pe after the ship in 
m y favorite T.V. show; I remember 
seeing Mr. Spock being interviewed in 
front of the Space Shuttle Enterprise. I 
remember how silly the shuttle looked, 
perched on the back of a 747. I watch-
ed 
the 
first launching of the 
shuttle and thought, "No way. There's 
no way that it is going to land." And 
then I saw it land. I remember the age 
when I considered m yself "too old" to 
be interested in the shuttle, and then 
genuinely losing interest a little later. 
Maybe I do associate the .shuttle with 
the United States after all, in a strange 
way. It was one of the few positive na-
tional symbols which I didn't find em-
barrassing, one of the few rockets 
which didn't kill people. 

I had some basic elements of an 
argument here: I just had to put them 
together, condense them, and I would 
be ready for a rematch with the Shuttle 
Cynic. So, the shuttle was one of the 
few positive symbols of the U.S., and it 
was floating in a sea of American 
Cheese. It was a particularly powerful 
and familiar image for my generation, 
the Shuttle Generation. In a way it 
represented my childhood: when it ex-
ploded, so did my youth. 

That sounded awful. I could barely 
repeat that to myself, let alone use it as 
an argument against the Cynic, who 
wanted to hear a solid justification for 
my reaction to the accident. He cer-
tainly wasn't interested in exploding 
youths. It just didn't seem like I was 
going to be able to wrap up my 
response to the explosion with fl few 
strings of logic- it was too compli-
cated, had too many sharp edges. But 
my inability to justify my response 
logically no longer led me to conclude 
that I was inept. I couldn't logically 
restate the reasons for my reaction 
because those reasons weren't logical. I 
realized that I had reacted on an 
emotional and certainly valid level, 
and the feelings I was working with 
could not be handed out as arguments 
in a debate. 

People at Yale are very concerned 
with arguments. They like to debate. 
The value of a gut emotional response, 
however, often goes unappreciated 
here. The explosion of the space shut-
tle is an example of an event which, for 
many people, provoked a huge gut 
response. For me, the explosion is not 
disturbing because of its political and 
intf':llectual ramifications; it is shocking 
in and of itself. 

The emotional 
response I experienced was not just ~ 
by-product of the event- it was the 
event, and it constitutes the sole im-
portance of that event. But how can I 
explain this to the Cynic? I don't 
understand my reaction m yself; I just 
know how badly I felt. I can't explain· 
my reaction logically. But that doesn't 
make it any less real. 

Maybe I am a fool to believe that an 
inexplicable emotional response can 
have more value than solid logical 
arguments, but I don't mind. The next 
time I meet the Cynic, I will hurl 
taunts at him: "Go ahead! Call me a 
fool!" I like it better that way.
