Cheap Service · 
To the Editor: 
In his article entitled "Out of Touch" 
(TN], 1/31/86), James Bennet has 
listed several instances of sloppy prac-
tice by the Yale University Health Ser-
. vices. His conclusion, that the pro-
blems would disappear if members 
discuss them with the Health Services, 
does not follow from the evidence. It is 
perhaps more logical to conclude that 
the Health Services' avowed goal of 
providing the cheapest possible 
medical care is incompatible with the 
patients' interest in receiving proper 
medical treatment. The Health Ser-
vices has had difficulty attracting and 
keeping a full staff of physicians, with 
the consequence that indicated medical 
examinations and treatments are 
postponed. Many departments, such 
as opthamology and gynecology, are 
staffed at a level inadequate to meet the 
demands for their services; patients are 
simply told that a two-month wait is 
"normal." The stories cited by Mr. 
Bennet, along with many others that 
he did not present, indicate that a large 
number of those physicians and nurse 
practitioners who do consent to work at 
the Health Services are either not suffi-
ciently competent or irresponsible. It is 
a reasonable guess that one reason real 
tragedies have not been reported is that 
patients recognize the shortcomings of 
the treatment that they receive at the 
Health Services and go elsewhere. 
These problems are substantial and 
will not evaporate once we discuss 
them with the Health Services, in part 
because many of them are problems in-
herent 
to Health Maintenance 
Organizations. 

The problems with the Yale Univer-
sity Health Services would be less im-
portant if Yale students could choose 
among, for example, the range of 
health plans that is open to Yale 
employees. The correct solution to the 
problems .. with the Health Services is 
not for students to talk about them 
while waiting for a tragedy but rather 
for Yale to allow its students to vote 
with their feet. 
Sincerely yours,

Oversight 
While I realize that The New journal is a 
publication of Yale College students, I 
wish that the article, "Out of Touch" 
(TN], 1131186) would have dealt with 
some of the problems that graduate 
and professional students have with 
UHS. It's not so much that the words 
"undergraduate" and "student" were 
used synonymously in the article (you 
get used to that around here after a 
while), but rather that it dealt exten-
sively with the Undergraduate Walk-in 
Service, a service by definition 
unavailable to G and P's. 

Having been ·an undergraduate here 
before entering the graduate school, I 
continued using the Walk-in Service 
until . my second year, when I was 
"found out" and told that as a graduate 
student I would have to make an ap-
pointment. The nature of my ailments 
(at the time a rather sore neck) had not 
changed with my academic status, 
neither had the cost of my health plan, 
only the accessibility of a 
nurse-
practitioner. 

T he U's in both DUH and UHS 
stand 
for 
university, 
not 
undergraduate. 
Sincerely, 
Jeffrey Clark

Sobering Thoughts 
A few thoughts upon the University 
Chaplain's "Final Words" (TN}, 
1/31186), and upon the general topic of 
hymns and prayers at University con-
vocations. 

As a Christian I find myself ill at 
ease when I meet with the parapher-
nalia of worship in secular settings. 
This is not only because I don't think 
non-believers should be manipulated 
into singing hymns and mouthing 
prayers, but also because I worry 
about what believers themselves think 
they are accomplishing by such obser-
vances. Our religiosity is complacent 
and self-serving enough at church; we 
need not add to our sins by making a 
pageant of it at school. Moreover, and 
in addition to the legitimate objections 
that can be raised by non-Christian 
members of the University com-
munity, Christians themselves ought 
to think twice before endorsing the 
religious trappings with which Yale, in , 
its more nostalgic moments, occa-
sionally decorates itself. 

We all like to solemnize our impor-
tance, institutions being no exception. 
And there is no more heady form of 
self-importance than to align oneself 
with the deity. Long before the Moral 
Majority was lining u p, God, America, 
morality and the free enterprise system 
in the fight against evil, a Puritan in-
stitution could exhort its membership 
to give its all "for God, for country, 
and for Yale." Yet quite apart from the 
fact that Yale no longer serves a self-
consciously Christian community, 
thoughtful Christians must question 
whether any institution's efforts to 
legitimate itself in religious terms 
should pass unchallenged. 

It seems to me that Christians, more 
than anyone else, should balk at sing-
ing lines like, 
"0 God beneath Thy guiding hand 
Our exiled fathers crossed the sea . . . " 
which were on the program for the 
Graduate and P.rofessional Assembly 
in September. For here it is precisely 
the Christian Gospel which is being 
misunderstood by enlisting it to 
validate the self-image of New England 
and its revered institutions. 

Believers and non-believers alike, 
Christians, J ews, and those who only 
question, will all do better to let God 
be God, and let institutions like Yale 
do their work in sobriety rather than 
self-glorification. For by the grace of 
God there is much good work to be 
done, honorable work which is both 
delightful in itself and of profit to this 
sick and suffering world. There is good 
reason to take up this work with joy, if 
we remember who we are and what we 
are about. The sobriety to remember 
that we and our endeavors are not 
God, sometimes comes easier to those 
who don't believe in God in the first 
place, but it will do believers a world of 
good to keep it in mind as well.
