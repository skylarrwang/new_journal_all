Last month's explosion of the space shuttle Challenger inspired a flood of media 
attention, some calling it the worst national tragedy since the assassination of 
President Kennedy. The author, however, must contend with rational Yalies 
who separate themselves .from the common reaction and look cynically at the 
event. By Peter Zusi.

Because it lacks both funding and a permanent home, The Ensemble Theater 
Company creates its own style of innovative drama. By Tom Augst.

**Author: Anne Applebaum and Rich Blow**
**Page number(s):  (Page number missing from provided text)**

Over the past eight years, Yale President A. Bartlett Giamatti has been both 
cheered and mocked, praised and vilified. He has never been called boring. 
With just months before he leaves Yale, Giamatti discussed in a series of ex-
clusive interviews how he m.o.de the transition .from Yale professor to Yale presi-
dent, and what he tried to achieve dun·ng his tenure. By Anne Applebaum and 
Rich Blow.


**Title: Growing into Motherhood**
**Author: Susan Orenstein**

The rate of teen pregnancy in New Haven exceeds the national average, creating 
a problem further complicated by inner-city poverty. Coping with the realities of 
motherhood, hundreds of teenage girls struggle each year, trying both to raise 
their children and remain in school. By Susan Orenstein.

Cheap Service · 
To the Editor: 
In his article entitled "Out of Touch" 
(TN], 1/31/86), James Bennet has 
listed several instances of sloppy prac-
tice by the Yale University Health Ser-
. vices. His conclusion, that the pro-
blems would disappear if members 
discuss them with the Health Services, 
does not follow from the evidence. It is 
perhaps more logical to conclude that 
the Health Services' avowed goal of 
providing the cheapest possible 
medical care is incompatible with the 
patients' interest in receiving proper 
medical treatment. The Health Ser-
vices has had difficulty attracting and 
keeping a full staff of physicians, with 
the consequence that indicated medical 
examinations and treatments are 
postponed. Many departments, such 
as opthamology and gynecology, are 
staffed at a level inadequate to meet the 
demands for their services; patients are 
simply told that a two-month wait is 
"normal." The stories cited by Mr. 
Bennet, along with many others that 
he did not present, indicate that a large 
number of those physicians and nurse 
practitioners who do consent to work at 
the Health Services are either not suffi-
ciently competent or irresponsible. It is 
a reasonable guess that one reason real 
tragedies have not been reported is that 
patients recognize the shortcomings of 
the treatment that they receive at the 
Health Services and go elsewhere. 
These problems are substantial and 
will not evaporate once we discuss 
them with the Health Services, in part 
because many of them are problems in-
herent 
to Health Maintenance 
Organizations. 

The problems with the Yale Univer-
sity Health Services would be less im-
portant if Yale students could choose 
among, for example, the range of 
health plans that is open to Yale 
employees. The correct solution to the 
problems .. with the Health Services is 
not for students to talk about them 
while waiting for a tragedy but rather 
for Yale to allow its students to vote 
with their feet. 
Sincerely yours, 
William H. Gilson

Oversight 
While I realize that The New journal is a 
publication of Yale College students, I 
wish that the article, "Out of Touch" 
(TN], 1131186) would have dealt with 
some of the problems that graduate 
and professional students have with 
UHS. It's not so much that the words 
"undergraduate" and "student" were 
used synonymously in the article (you 
get used to that around here after a 
while), but rather that it dealt exten-
sively with the Undergraduate Walk-in 
Service, a service by definition 
unavailable to G and P's. 

Having been ·an undergraduate here 
before entering the graduate school, I 
continued using the Walk-in Service 
until . my second year, when I was 
"found out" and told that as a graduate 
student I would have to make an ap-
pointment. The nature of my ailments 
(at the time a rather sore neck) had not 
changed with my academic status, 
neither had the cost of my health plan, 
only the accessibility of a 
nurse-
practitioner. 

T he U's in both DUH and UHS 
stand 
for 
university, 
not 
undergraduate. 
Sincerely, 
Jeffrey Clark

Sobering Thoughts 
A few thoughts upon the University 
Chaplain's "Final Words" (TN}, 
1/31186), and upon the general topic of 
hymns and prayers at University con-
vocations. 

As a Christian I find myself ill at 
ease when I meet with the parapher-
nalia of worship in secular settings. 
This is not only because I don't think 
non-believers should be manipulated 
into singing hymns and mouthing 
prayers, but also because I worry 
about what believers themselves think 
they are accomplishing by such obser-
vances. Our religiosity is complacent 
and self-serving enough at church; we 
need not add to our sins by making a 
pageant of it at school. Moreover, and 
in addition to the legitimate objections 
that can be raised by non-Christian 
members of the University com-
munity, Christians themselves ought 
to think twice before endorsing the 
religious trappings with which Yale, in , 
its more nostalgic moments, occa-
sionally decorates itself. 

We all like to solemnize our impor-
tance, institutions being no exception. 
And there is no more heady form of 
self-importance than to align oneself 
with the deity. Long before the Moral 
Majority was lining u p, God, America, 
morality and the free enterprise system 
in the fight against evil, a Puritan in-
stitution could exhort its membership 
to give its all "for God, for country, 
and for Yale." Yet quite apart from the 
fact that Yale no longer serves a self-
consciously Christian community, 
thoughtful Christians must question 
whether any institution's efforts to 
legitimate itself in religious terms 
should pass unchallenged. 

It seems to me that Christians, more 
than anyone else, should balk at sing-
ing lines like, 
"0 God beneath Thy guiding hand 
Our exiled fathers crossed the sea . . . " 
which were on the program for the 
Graduate and P.rofessional Assembly 
in September. For here it is precisely 
the Christian Gospel which is being 
misunderstood by enlisting it to 
validate the self-image of New England 
and its revered institutions. 

Believers and non-believers alike, 
Christians, J ews, and those who only 
question, will all do better to let God 
be God, and let institutions like Yale 
do their work in sobriety rather than 
self-glorification. For by the grace of 
God there is much good work to be 
done, honorable work which is both 
delightful in itself and of profit to this 
sick and suffering world. There is good 
reason to take up this work with joy, if 
we remember who we are and what we 
are about. The sobriety to remember 
that we and our endeavors are not 
God, sometimes comes easier to those 
who don't believe in God in the first 
place, but it will do believers a world of 
good to keep it in mind as well.

Between the Vines/ Peter Zusi 
Understanding Disaster 
It finally happened: I met the Space 
Shuttle Cynic. I had thought, perhaps 
too audaciously, that even in this 
breeding ground of cynicism called 
Yale, the news of the shuttle explosion 
might escape unscathed. I should have 
known better. I was hanging out at 
Yale Station when the figure emerged 
from his cloud of cigarette smoke and 
approached me. Conversation began 
innocently enough: we exchanged a 
couple of quick wittici;;ms about the 
lighting in the L&B room and then 
progressed into a protracted discussion 
about Christmas vacation. Yet before I 
knew what happened, the word had 
been said. Shuttle. As in Space, that is. 
As in explosion, as in thousands of kids 
watching six 
astronauts and a 
schoolteacher die six miles from Earth. 
"What did you think of the accident?" 
his look seemed to ask me. "It really 
d isturbed me. I was shocked much 
more deeply than I expected to be. 
Yeah, it was really awful." The en-
counter had begun. 

"That's stupid," sneered the Cynic. 
"I think the whole thing has been 
blown out of proportion. What are you, 
patriotic?" This, I realized, was the 
first exchange of what could be a fierce 
battle, and that slowly, point by point, 
the Cynic hoped to reduce my kneejerk 
reaction to rubble. I considered my op-
tions against this first question. Truth 
be known, I don't think I am especially 
patriotic- I feel more allegiance to the 
local bagel store than to the United 
States. When I 
think of modern 
America, tackiness comes to mind: 
3-D movies, big cars with loose-fitting 
chrome parts, or people dressed up in 
Mickey Mouse costumes. American 
Cheese, I've always felt, was a good 
symbol of our country: it's an un-
natural orange color, and it looks like 
plastic. 

"No," I said. 

"Aha! Since you are not disturbed by 
the demise of a patriotic symbol, nor 
upset over the damage to the country's 
image," he said, squinting his eyes, 
"you must be an aficionado of high 
technology." 

H mmm. This one made me think 
hard. I kept trying to conjure up the 
technology in my life and aJI I could 
see was the refrigerator. That started 
to make me hungry. I had to admit to 
myself, 
though, 
that kitchen 
ap-
pliances didn't really count as "high 
technology," and that I had to think of 
something else. 

Backyard satellite 
television 
antennae? 
No. 
Cruise 
missiles? No. I started to tremble at the 
thought of conceding another point, 
but what else could I do? 


"Well, well, well. If you weren't 
disturbed by the glaring failure of 
American technology, nor by the set-
back to future shuttle m issions, could 
it be the deaths which upset you?" 

I saw the trap he had lain. If I said 
yes then I would be open to the reply 
about airline disasters, about how 500 
people 
can 
be 
killed over 
the 
Himalayas and we hardly bat an eye, 
but when seven people are killed over 
Florida everyone gets upset. This was 
not even to mention tidal waves in 
Bangladesh, which have killed over 
20,000 people, or the ongoing suffering 
of people in South Africa or South 
America, or the Bronx. If I answered 
this question with a straight "yes," I 
was bound to be snowballed. 

"In a way but . . . " but I was inter· 
rupted. 

"In a way? What about plane crashes 
which kill 500 people, or mudslides in 
South America which kill 20,000 peo· 
pie, or the ongoing suffering of people 
in Angola, or Nicaragua, or even 
the Bronx. In terms ol human sutler· 
ing the Shuttle accident was a minor 
one. So where does that leave your 
argument now? Why are you so shock-
ed by the incident?" 

"It ... um ... " I replied. 

"Obviously, my friend, you're a 
puppet of the press, responding to the 
size of the type on the front page of The 
New York Times, to the 10 solid pages of 
Shuttle stories in that first issue, and to 
the flood of front page articles which 
have appeared every, day since then. 
Do you really think that's an intelligent 
way to respond to an event? In my 
opinion, 
the whole affair only 
demonstrates bow easily the press 
manipulates the masses. It's really very 
frightening. The Shuttle has gotten far 
too much attention. People are ob· 
sessed with it." Having posited these .
truths, the cynic turned and disap· 
peared behind his cloud of smoke, 
from whence he came. 

So, I had met the Space Shuttle 
Cynic, we battled, and I lost. Lost, I 
thought, in a big way. I walked home, 
feeling like Jello in a dining hall. 
The hallway had little pools of beer 
left over from a party the night before. 
I waded into my room, sat c!own with 
my head in hands, and reconsidered 
myself. Why did I commit myself to a 
viewpoint which I couldn't even de· 
fend? Why didn't I think these issues 
through? Maybe I'm just too young, 
inexperienced, too naive to see clearly 
in 
such 
a 
situation. 
I 
hurled 
deprecating epithets at myself. Unin· 
sightful fool. 
Babe-in-the-woods. 
Sophomore. I felt like an idiot, a 
failure. But then, just as I was indul· 
ging in self-flagellation, my instincts 
for self-preservation kicked in. I was 
sure I had been right. There was

nothing wrong with being upset by the 
crash. I had just been caught off-
guard and couldn't justify my re-
action; I needed to think it through 
more thoroughly. 

Why did I have such a strong re-
action to the shuttle accident? The 
more I thought about it, the more dif-
ficult it was to explain. Maybe it had 
something to do with my age, with how 
I grew up relative to the space pro-
gram. I was too young to remember 
the moon landing, but one of my 
earliest memories is of a T .V. set up in 
our kitchen, showing a cloudy image 
which my parents told me was a 
rocket. On the same screen, but years 
later, I watched the Apollo-Soyuz 
hook-up. Through high school, I saw 
the shuttle develop from preliminary 
drawings published in magazines to 
live footage on the T .V. They even 
named the protot1·pe after the ship in 
m y favorite T.V. show; I remember 
seeing Mr. Spock being interviewed in 
front of the Space Shuttle Enterprise. I 
remember how silly the shuttle looked, 
perched on the back of a 747. I watch-
ed 
the 
first launching of the 
shuttle and thought, "No way. There's 
no way that it is going to land." And 
then I saw it land. I remember the age 
when I considered m yself "too old" to 
be interested in the shuttle, and then 
genuinely losing interest a little later. 
Maybe I do associate the .shuttle with 
the United States after all, in a strange 
way. It was one of the few positive na-
tional symbols which I didn't find em-
barrassing, one of the few rockets 
which didn't kill people. 

I had some basic elements of an 
argument here: I just had to put them 
together, condense them, and I would 
be ready for a rematch with the Shuttle 
Cynic. So, the shuttle was one of the 
few positive symbols of the U.S., and it 
was floating in a sea of American 
Cheese. It was a particularly powerful 
and familiar image for my generation, 
the Shuttle Generation. In a way it 
represented my childhood: when it ex-
ploded, so did my youth. 

That sounded awful. I could barely 
repeat that to myself, let alone use it as 
an argument against the Cynic, who 
wanted to hear a solid justification for 
my reaction to the accident. He cer-
tainly wasn't interested in exploding 
youths. It just didn't seem like I was 
going to be able to wrap up my 
response to the explosion with fl few 
strings of logic- it was too compli-
cated, had too many sharp edges. But 
my inability to justify my response 
logically no longer led me to conclude 
that I was inept. I couldn't logically 
restate the reasons for my reaction 
because those reasons weren't logical. I 
realized that I had reacted on an 
emotional and certainly valid level, 
and the feelings I was working with 
could not be handed out as arguments 
in a debate. 

People at Yale are very concerned 
with arguments. They like to debate. 
The value of a gut emotional response, 
however, often goes unappreciated 
here. The explosion of the space shut-
tle is an example of an event which, for 
many people, provoked a huge gut 
response. For me, the explosion is not 
disturbing because of its political and 
intf':llectual ramifications; it is shocking 
in and of itself. 

The emotional 
response I experienced was not just ~ 
by-product of the event- it was the 
event, and it constitutes the sole im-
portance of that event. But how can I 
explain this to the Cynic? I don't 
understand my reaction m yself; I just 
know how badly I felt. I can't explain· 
my reaction logically. But that doesn't 
make it any less real. 

Maybe I am a fool to believe that an 
inexplicable emotional response can 
have more value than solid logical 
arguments, but I don't mind. The next 
time I meet the Cynic, I will hurl 
taunts at him: "Go ahead! Call me a 
fool!" I like it better that way.

Book.keepu Mr. Zero (Bert Gankof) auiduoualy, 
ETC production of Adding Machine. 

Electronic music echoed through the 
auditorium. White gas, spewing from 
under their seats, enveloped the audi-
ence. On stage, large white numbers 
were suspended against a black cur-
tain, and wood stumps popped open 
into flowerbeds of colored balloons. 
Presenting shows such as this 1923 
Elmer Rice drama, 
The Adding 
Machine, The Ensemble Theater Com-
pany (ETC) sees itself as a vanguard 
for small theater. Though it lacks the 
funding to pay any of its artists or to 
construct elaborate sets, ETC produces 
plays that are risky, imaginative, and 
what its directors hope will be a 
refreshing alternative to other theater 
in New Haven. 

Founded last year by Artistic Direc-
tors Kevin Cochran, '83, and Bill 
8 The New J ournal/February 28, 1986 
Ferguson, '83, ETC has already tap-
ped into the audiences that attend the 
Longwharf and Yale 
Repertory 
Theatres. With success that surprises 
even Cochran and Ferguson, ETC has 
sold out every seat for each of its plays 
and already has a loyal following of 250 
season subscribers. 

One reason for the theater's success 
lies in the informal and spirited at-
titude of the ensemble. 
Cochran 
believes that ETC appeals to people by 
offering the fun that larger theaters in 
New Haven lack. "Theater is enter-
tainment," he said. "If you don't relax 
the audience, you'll never affect them." 

Tom Killiam, a drama critic for the 
NtW Haven Register who has seen much 
of their work, agreed. "It's the adven-
ture of the whole thing. Whether au-
~ 
keep• track of finance• in the 
diences like (the play] or not, everyone 
enjoys the experience." 

ETC has performed without a 
theater for most of the season, taking 
its plays instead to different locations 
around New Haven. Inherit the WinJ 
was produced at the Moot Court in tht 
Yale Law School. For Life is a Dream, 
blindfolded audiences were loaded on· 
to a schoolbus and taken to an 
unknown location, to identify with the 
play's protagonist. ETC also plans to 
produce Tommy . . . the Rock Opera at 
Toad's Place, as well as Agnes of God in 
Yale's Dwight Chapel. 

"The use of different locations camt 
about as a happy coincidence of 
historical and aesthetic motivations: 
Ferguson explained. Without the fund· 
ing to establish a permanent home,


ETC has the opportunity to experi-
ment with different ways to involve the 
audience in its plays. "When you take a 
play out of the theater," Ferguson con-
tinued, "you also take away hampering 
conventions." Once the habits of 
"typical" theater, such as where one sits 
and when one applauds, are broken, 
Ferguson believes that the audience's 
experience wiJI be very different. 

non-threatening," Cochran asserted. 
"If they're bored somewhere else, they 
feel stupid. If they're bored here, the 
play just didn't work out." 

ETC's future will depend on its 
special audience appeal. Rather than 
fundraising through government and 
corporate grants like 
most new 
theaters, ETC has chosen to support 
itself solely through ticket sales. With 
The Ensemble Theater Company, undaunted by its lack of a permanent atage, 
produces its plays at a variety of locations in New Haven. Here, Inherit tlu 
Wind is performed at Moot Court at the Yale Law School. 

ETC's artistic directors believe that 
through this experimentation, they 
have successfully created a dynamic 
relationship with their audience. "Thev 
are not alienated by our faults," 
Ferguson explained. "Our faults are 
avenues into the show. At the same 
time, these flaws allow us to get closer 
to the audience." During a perfor-
mance of Th~ Adding Machmt when the 
set got caught in a curtain. the audi-
ence laughed and then applauded. 
Rather than detract from the play, 
such events add to the intimate ex-
perience ETC seeks to create. "We're 
the development of a loyal following, 
ETC can avoid the fate of many ex-
perimental theaters which quickly 
become conservative under the 
pressure of corporate support and 
boards of directors. While ETC has the 
artistic freedom to perform lesser-
produced plays in challenging ways, 
the audience remains Cochran's 
primary reason for sustaining that 
freedom.

"The constitution of 
Yale is a constitutional 
monarchy, but one in 
which the king is 
crucial. And the 
president is king." 
10 The New JournaVFebruary 28, 1986 
On a Saturday in 1978, the Yale Corporation interviewed A. Bartlett 
Giamatti. On Sunday they asked him to be president of Yale, and on 
Monday, Giamatti accepted. Not long after, he became the victim of 
a recurring nightmare. 

"I was in a huge airplane hangar, an immense structure, larger than 
I could define the limits of," he remembers. "There was a puzzle in 
there, one of those huge puzzles, and I wasn't even sure I knew where 
all the pieces were. I knew I didn't know where all the pieces were." 

Giamatti's qualms about his nearly overnight transformation from 
English professor to Yale president didn't affect his emerging public 
image. The press loved Bart Giamatti then and has ever since. He was 
articulate, outspoken, and president of Yale, more than enough to 
make colorful reading. He looked different from most college 
presidents. In those early days, he was described over and over again 
as a "Renaissance Man," a student of Machiavelli and Dante who 
walked around campus wearing work boots and a battered Red Sox 
cap. His family car was an aging Volkswagen Bug. I-te had a sense of 
humor; this was the man who once said that the only thing he had 
ever wanted to be was president of baseball's American League. And 
he represented a break from tradition- Yale's first "ethnic" president. 

After eight years, the hoopla surrounding Giamatti's ascendence to 
the Yale presidency has given way to more realistic, if sometimes con· 
flicting, perceptions of his beliefs and principles. Now he is difficult to 
label. The same people who hailed him as a great liberal after he 
blasted the Moral Majority· in a speech to the freshmen felt betrayed 
when he took an obviously sincere hard-line stance during the strike, 
refusing to consent to binding arbitration. On the other hand, the Old 
Blues who applauded when he announced in his Inaugural Address 
that the University should be a place of "civilized order" and a "stan-
dard in times of uncertainty and disaffection" surely grimaced when 
he declared his belief that no money or effort should be spent on 
athletic recruiting. And although it's hard to find many people within 
the administration who will say anything negative about him, grumb-
ling students and faculty members accuse him of having grown stale 
and of lacking innovative ideas. 

Giamatti takes these accusations as a part of the job. "If people like 
what you do, you're a shining moral light. And if they don't like what 
you do, while you think you're doing the same thing in a different con-
text, then you're a retrograde oppressor of everybody. All I want to do 
is to be consistent with my perception of my principles." 

ButGiamatti'sprinciplesdid notinstantlyemerge when he became pres-
ident, nor have they always been clear to the Yale community. To under-
stand his presidency, it's critical to understand his principles, for they have 


always dictated his actions as presi-
dent. They derive from his devotion to 
Yale as an institution, his Renaissance. 
scholarship, and his experiences as a 
teacher at Yale during the late sixties 
and early seventies. 

In a series of interviews over the past 
several weeks, Giamatti discussed the 
origins of his principles, how they have 
shaped Yale, and how he acquired the 
authority to apply them. 

Talking with Giamatti, one can't 
help but notice how much older he 
looks than he did when he first became 
president. He has gained weight; 
wrinkles and deep bags line his face 
and eyes. He smokes heavily, in the 
hungry manner of someone who en-
joys smoking too much even to con-
sider quitting. There is no more black 
in his once-raven beard. But Giamatti 
has lost none of the verbal and mental 
dexterity that made him such an at-
tractive candidate for the presidency in 
1978. Why did he decide to talk now? 
"Because it's the end," he explains. 
"Because in a funny way you want it 
said." 

The entry for Angelo Bartlett Giamatti 
in the Class of'60 yearbook reads like a 
list of Yale social clubs: the Dramat, 
Pundits, the Elizabethan Club, Delta 
Kappa Epsilon, Aurelian, Scroll and 
Key. He joined almost as many com-
mittees: 
Charities Drive, 
Under-
graduate Affairs Committee, Senior 
Advisory Board, Class Day Orator, 
Saybrook College Council. Giamatti 
was a Yale man to the core. He had the 
family heritage- his father, a professor 
of Italian, was class of'32-and he had 
been "prepared," as the yearbook put 
it, at Andover. 

Giamatti was both well-liked and 
well-known. According to University 
Secretary John Wilkinson, a classmate 
of Giamatti's, "After six months every-
one knew who he was. He was just a 
powerful 
personality. 
He was 
dramatic. He always wore a trench-
coat, always wore dark glasses, always 
walked around with a cigarette hang-
ing out of his mouth. He was sort of in 
a Humphrey Bogart phase." 

Giamatti's enthusiasm and admira-
tion for Yale institutions didn't end 
with his undergraduate days. Cyrus 
Hamlin, one of Giamatti's graduate


classmates in Comparative 
Literature and later a fellow Yale pro-
fessor, recalls a time when the two 
were playing a Whiffenpoof record. 
"When it came to the Whiffenpoof 
song, Bart insisted that no one speak. 
It was that kind of intensity." In fact, 
Giamatti has spent only two years of 
his adult life away from Yale, teaching 
at Princeton after he received his 
Ph.D. in 1964. He then returned in 
1966 and became a full professor 
within five years. At age 33, he was 
one of the youngest scholars ever to be 
granted tenure in the Yale English 
department. 

Giamatti's respect for the sanctity of 
institutions extended beyond his devo-
tion to Yale. As a scholar, Giamatti 
never pretended to be anything other 
than a traditionalist. Even at a universi-
ty world-famous for its avant-garde 
critics, the home of the "Yale School~ 
and deconstructionism, he remained a 
staunch advocate of traditional notions 
of reading and interpretation. Today, 
Giamatti freely expresses his distaste 
for "people who wish to have it thought 
that everything we teach is a structure 
of the political and economic systeJll 
we come out of." The point of scholar-
ship, he feels, is to elucidate texts, to 
"show what they meant, then implicitly 
or explicitly evaluate them against 
some notion of what was good and 
what wasn't." The importance of the 
original statement of the poet exceeds 
the value of issues like the examination 
of the social role of the critic or un· 
earthing the implied ethical values of 
the literary canon.

labelling and re-examining his critic<.J 
standpoint, neither was he enthusiastic 
in the late sixties when students began 
demanding a re-examination of the 
role of the university in modern 
America. Rejecting condemnations of 
the university as the institutionalization 
of elite values, Giamatti turned for 
support to the positions of 16th-
century Humanism, just as he had 
always turned to traditional texts for 
clarification of his values and beliefs. 


There he rediscovered classically 
liberal notions of the university and 
education, notions to which he still 
subscribes. 
The University, claims Giamatti, is 
'"a paradoxical creature. You have an 
involved, 
very competitive com-
munity-very competitive by design-
and yet the normal financial incentives 
for competition are absent." Because of 
the absence of self-serving motives, the 
University is a place where people are 
free "for pursuing not one single truth, 
but all the various truths there are, and 
all the new knowledge that there can be 
at the same time as you remember and 
accumulate the old." Competition oc-
curs within this "free market of ideas" 
in a "fruitful, yet joyous and intense 
fashion, and that's the wonderful 
mystery at the heart of the university. 
That people are free, yet they assume 
constraints that keep other people free 
.... , You're really independent when 
you begin to understand the pleasure 
of dependence on others. You don't 
have to be isolated to be independent." 


Giamatti will grant that this is an 
ideal. He won't pretend that his vision 
describes everyday life at Yale. But he 
will defend his positions vehemently, 
and in the early seventies that meant 
attacking anyone who questioned the 
value of education at private institu-
tions like Yale. His writings satirized 
"open" classrooms, New Math, and the 
•individualized instruction" and •eJective 
systems" which produced students who 
emerged "not knowing how to listen to 
anyone else, not knowing how to take a 
direction." He refused to accept the 
prevailing idea that Yale was an elitist 
institution which needed to reorient 
itself in a new political direction. 


Again, Renaissance texts supported his 
arguments. 
"Humanism," he pro-
claimed, "was designed to develop a 
flexible method of inquiry, not a 
preconceived message. Education was 
linked to politics- one was meant to be 
led out into the city-but education 
was not 'politicized.'" 


The sports articles which Giamatti 
wrote during his years as an English 
professor also provide telling evidence 
of Giamatti's attitude towards 
American youth and American values 
during that period of time. His "Tom 
Seaver's .l:'"areweU," which he wrote for 
HOTpers;- praised the Mets pitcher for 
"gaining control over a block of soace 
approximately three feet high, 18 in-
ches wide," while "Yippies yipped, 
flower children blossomed and 
withered." Giamatti wrote that he had 
"no idea what opinions Seaver then 
had on race, politics, war, marijuana, 
and the other ERA, but whatever they 
were, or are, they are beside the point. 
The point is the way Seaver was 
perceived- as clean-cut, larger than 
life, a fastballer, 'straight,' all the time 
when many other young people, who 
were getting lots of newspaper 
coverage, were none of the above." 


In a more blatant attack on anti-
Establishment sentiment, Giamatti 
caricatured one of these "other young 
people" as "outfitted for peace at the 
Army-Navy store with his coded cries 
about relevance and community and 
his roomful of stereos, cameras, and 
electric typewriters, whose deepest 
dream was to bring about the Revolu-
tion and get credit for it." Yet he also 
considered these students a failure on 
the part of American educational in-
stitutions. Liberal arts universities 
had failed to articulate their relation-
ship with society, to clarify their goals 
and purposes. This lapse had resulted 
in the halt of intelligent debate and 
communication, the central focus of 
Giamatti's ideal university. In the early 
seventies, he feared that the intellec-
tual tradition would erode into senti-
mentality. Language had become a 
medium 
for expressing individual 
desire rather than a forum for shaping 
the relationship between the free, ra-
tional individual and society. 


Given these viewpoints, it was no 
surprise when Giamatti, despite his 
"liberal" image, turned out to be a con-
servative president. He simply stuck to 
his principles. Just as he had verbally 
defended the humanistic university 
against radical attacks during the six· 
ties, he continued as president to de-
fend its independence against the more 
concrete intrusions of government, 
unions, the M oral Majority, and the 
remains 
of student activism. 


In 
Giamatti's eyes, his assurance of finan-
cial aid for students denied govern-
ment loans for refusing to register for 
the draft derived from the same princi-
ple which led him to reject binding ar-
bitration during the Local 34 strike. He 
insisted that the Yale G lee Club could 
not sing the Solidarity anthem on the 
Voice of America for the same reason 
that he consistently refused to reveal 
his own opinions on current political or 
social issues. He explains, "I would 
have seen all of those issues as trying to 
be consistent to a 
sense of the 
autonomy of the university, and the 
capacity of the university to manage its 
own affairs." Moreover, he believes 
that neither Yale nor Yale's president 
should associate themselves with a 
single partisan viewpoint. "I think I 
should encourage an environment 
where I can have my judgements and 
you can have yours. I am not obliged 
to satisfy 
everybody's ideological 
labels." 


Even if Bart Giamatti did arrive in the 
office of the Yale presidency with a clear 
mandate from the Corporation a nd his 
own set of classical educational prin-
ciples, he knew it would take time to 
enact them. As he explains it, the 
greatest problem he faced during his 
first years was that "you have to find a 
voice, find a style, fmd a way of ex-
pressing yourself that doesn't presume 
on the one hand to be the innermost 
thoughts o f an extraordinarily 
variegated group of people, many of 
whom will shortly profoundly disagree 
with what you say. But on the other 
hand, your style can't be hedging so 
many .bets and being so cautious as to 
be totally bland a nd inaudible. I didn't 
have an institutional style. I hadn't 
been pre!!ident very long. I was work-
ing on it." 


In the process of finding this voice, 
Giamatti encountered several stumb· 
lin ~r blocks. He found himself con· 
fronted with an immediate change in 
lifestyle, even more abrupt and ex· 
treme than he had expected. "You are 
not doing what you did before. It's a 
different job, and it carries a different 
way of life. That doesn't mean your 
values change, but it certainly changes 
what you do and how you do things. I 
can't go slouching into the Yale Bowl 
and sit in the end zone in my blue jeans 
and workboots on a Saturday the way I 
could when I lived across the street in 
Westville. First of all, I can't sit in the 
end zone. I have to sit where the presi· 
dent sits. What- do you think I could 
move evervthing to the end zone?" 


Giamatti re~embers in particular 
the shock of his first interview, con-
ducted by Sally Quinn of the Wash-
ington Post. "You sit down, and you talk 
to th:s person, and you go home, and 
she prints an article, and what does she 
say? 'H e looks like a Mafioso.' She did. 
She said this. 'He looks like a don, and 
with him is a guy who looks like his 
consigliere.' She had no idea what a 
slur, to use a polite word, that was. If 1 
were a black or a Jew she wouldn't 
have said something that egregious. 


"Not everything's as dramatic or as 
painful as that was. But it was that pro· 
cess of translation from father or Yale 
academic or a guy who writes about 
sports for Harper's to this object which 
has no relation to your self-perception. 
If you decide you're going to be what 
they say, then you're playing with 
them. If you decide the heck with 
them, I'm me- they'U take you apart. 
You make adjustments." 


Even after discounting the shock of 
becoming a public figure so quickly, 
Giamatti's memories of the first two 
years are not particularly cheerful. 
"People would say to me in the first 
year, 'Do you like it?' and I would say, 
'Oh, it's ... fascinating!' People would 
say, 'Are you having fun?' and I'd say, 
'Fun? I'm not sure about having fun . 
Fun?'" Almost immediately, a conflict 
between personal feelings and presi·


dential responsibility arose when his 
first major appointment, Provost Abe 
Goldstein, was revealed to have spent 
some $70,000 of Yale money re-
decorating his university-owned 
house. Shortly after, Goldstein re-
signed. The issue remains so emo-
tionally charged that Giamatti still 
refuses to talk about it. 


Not long after, Giamatti faced a dif-
ferent challenge from Robert Brustein, 
then dean of the Yale Drama School. 
The two quarrelled over a range of 
issues, including how much emphasis 
the school should place on the Yale 
Repertory Theater- Brustein's per-
sonal project-how much on the 
graduate school, and how much on the 
undergraduate Dramat, 
to which 
Giamatti himself had belonged. The 
disagreement swelled into an argu-
ment over how much control the cen-
tral university administration had over 
a department. Brustein ultimately left 
Yale to head the American Repertory 
Theater in Cambridge, but the quarrel 
left Giamatti extremely sensitive about 
future challenges to his authority. 


Giamatti explains, "After all, it's im-
portant to every university president 
that they are able to legitimately take 
the responsibility they are given. This 
is a job with a lot of responsibility, and 
not a whole lot of authority." Giamatti 
had realized that the Yale presidency is 
a position whose prestige and whose of-
ficial power do not necessarily match 
one another. At least, he asserts it to be 
that way. "Power!" he exclaims. "I 
would love to have, in reality, a 
smidgen of what is ascribed." 


In a literal sense, Giamatti is right. 
As Corporation member Maxine 
Singer explained, "When he started as 
President,_1:here were certain customs 
and established practices, certain ex-
pectations about the relation between 
the Corporation and the Yale Presi-
dent which he assumed." The Presi-
dent cannot simply step in and take 
control. For example, the Corporation 
by-laws do give the president the right 
to appoint faculty, 
but accepted 
custom prevents this from happening 
under normal circumstances. The 
president is also technically in charge 
of the budget, yet the burden of its 
specific divisions falls to the Provost. 
The president is 
therefore under


On the President's Image: 
"The Yale community doesn't want 
a president who makes a fool or a 
public spectacle out of himself. 
There may be people who think I 
do, but it's not because I set out to 
do it. But then you don't want some 
shrinking, sad, wizened little 
creature that I claim I am all the 
time. You want to have someone 
you can feel good about when you're 
watching the David Susskind show. 
You don't want to say, 'Oh no, it's 
Giamatti, let's get into the car and 
go to .... Burger King or some-
thing.' Not tlilat you should sit there 
and say' 'Ob my God, rm in awe, 
it's the president of Yale!'" 


On America: "The thing about 
America is that the elite class, 
whatever that means, tends to be 
made by universities, not by in-
herited wealth, standing armies, or 
the state church. One of the reasons 
American culture is so devoted to 
education is that education was the 
way you made yourself into an 
American. That was different from 
the Old Country and I'm sufficient-
ly a patriot to say that it's better. I 
would rather live in a country where 
you didn't have to be born in a fami-
ly that always went to college in 
order to go to coUege.• 


On Poetry: •I think criticism is 
interesting, but I don't think it's as 
interesting as reading a great poem. 
And I don't think it's nearly as in-
teresting as writing a great poem. 
And if I really could have asked the 
Creator to make me in a way that 
would have been interesting, it 
would have been to write poems, 
not to engage in debates about 
whether or not my insight into 
somebody else's insight was creative 
or not.•

unavoidable financial 
constraints. 

Finally, he is without any guarantee 
that in most cases his advice will be 
obeyed, especially by the faculty, 
which guards its independence fiercely. 
Aside from his ceremonial func-
tions, his only official task is to make 
appointments such as university of-
ficers, deans, masters, and department 
chairpersons. All of these appoint-
ments are made through an extensive 
committee process, and again the 
president is obliged by custom to heed 
their advice. 

There is, however, another side to 
the coin. As History Professor Donald 
Kagan puts it, Giamatti's willingness 
to deprecate his own power is "part of 
Bart's shrewdness and wisdom. That's 
one of the first requirements of a presi-
dent, to say that. But my own opinion 
after watching Yale for 17 years is that 
the constitution of Yale is a constitu-
tional monarchy, but one in which the 
king is crucial. And the president is 
king." Giamatti may not have many 
officially designated tasks, but as 
Kagan points out, "When the presi-
dent, as the symbol of the university, 
comes to people and says, 'Look, I 
need your help,' you know what they'd 
do? They'd say 'yes.'" 

Giamatti is not unaware of this 
aspect of his job. He explains, "Power 
is essentially a 
function, to which · 
everyone subscribes. And if it is ascrib-
ed to you, even if you don't have it, 
you do have it." For Giamatti, wielding 
power at Yale is like conducting a sym-
phony orchestra. "If the orchestra 
decides they're not going to look at the 
conductor, then they're not going to do 
it. But if they decide to look at the con-
ductor and they trust him, then they 
may not like it all the time, but they'll 
follow him." The Yale president, like 
an orchestra conductor, must convince 
people to trust him if he wants to maintain 
his authority. After overcoming 
some initial insecurity and challenges 
to his authority, Giamatti seems to 
have obtained this trust. And with the 
respect of the Yale community comes 
an immense amount of what he calls 
"the power of suasion, the power to 
persuade." 

Giamatti attributes the success of his 
administration to his sense of self-
preservation, saying, "I don't mean


"I never want to be 
one of those people of 
whom they're saying 
in parking lots and 
hallways, 'When's he 
going to go?'" 

self-preservation in a physical literal 
sense of the word, I mean politically 
viable. And I mean politically in the 
best and largest sense of the word, try-
ing to involve a polity, create a com-
munity. To that extent you do not 
engage in acts that are designed to lose 
the goodwill that you must draw upon 
when something you're trying to do 
needs to be done. I can't say, 'You're 
going to be Master of X, you're going 
to be Chairman of Y, and you're going 
to be Director of Z.' People do not have 
to obey." Instead, Giamatti relies on 
his humility. "I paint myself as this 
besieged, weak creature trying to get 
through the day-the Wimp of Woodbridge 
Hall. It is not ineffective." 

But Giamatti's persuasive talents ex-
tend beyond simple self-preservation. 
Kagan attributes Giamatti's success 
with people to his sincere devotion to 
the institution. "You can't say no, 
because you know he means it, you 
know that he cares, you know that he's 
not a distant figure who is them, rather 
than us." Director of Athletics Frank 
Ryan adds, "You have to realize that 
there's nobody who doesn't like Bart 
Giamatti. People like him because he 
likes them. He's the mouth for their 
own emotions and feelings. He can 
converse with the common man." 

In short, Giamatti's ability to exer-
cise power as Yale president is inseparable 
from, even dependent upon 
the power of his personality. Not 
everyone feels this style of leadership is 
always appropriate. Comments 
Wilkinson, "Giamatti doesn't walk on 
water. He can be tempestuous, dif-
ficult, cranky. And he's called some 
things wrong, stylistically, maybe said 
the right thing the wrong way. On oc-
casion the very force and power of his 
personality have been such that there 
were people who felt that they weren't 
really heard." 

Critics also challenge Giamatti's 
sincerity, pointing to his ability to 
charm with personality if he can't con-
vince with facts. 
More than one 
observer has invoked Giamatti's 
undergraduate acting career as proof 
that the president can play whatever 
role a 
situation demands. 
One 
Literature professor compared 
Giamatti 
to 
Prince 
Hal 
in 
Shakespeare's Henry V, emphasizing 
Hal's transformation from a fun-loving 
inhabitant of the "tavern world" to the 
aloof and manipulative King Henry V. 

If Giamatti has taken advantage of 
his strong personality to 
wield 
presidential power more effectively, he 
has also paid a personal price for it. 
When the power of the president 
depends on the individual's strength of 
personality rather than written codes, 
the president becomes a ripe target for 
those who wish to attack the institu-
tion. During the 1984 strike, for in-
stance, Local 34 ridiculed Giamatti by 
printing and selling "Bartbuster" 
t-shirts and chanting anti-Giamatti 
manifestos. The union's strategy was 
to discredit the position of the Yale ad-
ministration by discrediting Giamatti. 

"No human being enjoys having to 
have a bodyguard to walk around on 
campus," Giamatti says today, almost 
certainly with more stoicism than he 
could manage at the time. "No human 
being enjoys having his family sub-
jected to the kinds of things mine were. 
No human being enjoys being called 
those names and being held up to con-
tempt and ridicule. But no human 
being who confronts that and then 
changes all of his beliefs about what the 
place stands for and how money is 
allocated would be worth very much." 

Despite his reliance on style, 
Giamatti will probably be remembered 
in substantive terms as the president 
who balanced the books at Yale. That 
was Giamatti's first priority when he 
became president, and he has succeeded 
in eliminating the Yale deficit- for 
years a multi-million dollar embar-
rassment- and helped almost triple 
Yale's endowment. That achievement, 
along with his well-publicized attention 
to alumni relations, Yale-New Haven 
relations, boosting faculty salaries, and 
restoring campus buildings, has given 
his presidency a "housekeeping" flavor.

**Title: Giamatti's Departure**
**Author:  Not specified**
**Page number(s): 19-21**

Hamlin agrees, saying, "I think that 
the real commttment ne has to educa-
tion and to the humanities has had to 
be put on the back burner in order to 
tend to things like the budget and the 
alumni support, and the buildings and 
grounds, and labor problems. This was 
hardly what he had in mind when he 
came into office." 


To an extent, Giamatti concedes the 
point, saying, "I haven't been able to 
sit here thinking what I can do for the 
humanities- but then 
I 
shouldn't 
have. Of course anybody who's presi-
dent of a university is going to be 
presented with labor problems and 
municipal probl~ms. But I did not 
slack in 
my devotion 
to 
the 
humanities, I have simply increased 
my devotion to the rest of the place." 


Even when Giamatti has been able 
to speak out on educational theory, his 
renowned emphasis on the humanities 
never really embraced the sciences. No 
matter how much money Giamatti 
sank into the renovation ·of science 
facilities, or how much time he spent 
trying to woo prominent scientists to 
the Yale faculty, it was clear that 
Giamatti could not articulate a love for 
the sciences as he could for the 
humanities. 


"From a personal standpoint, I was 
disappointed in his talks which so often 
dealt with the question of liberal edu-
cation," said Singer, a highly-respected 
biologist in addition to being a Cor-
poration member. "I agree with those 
talks as far as they go, yet he didn't in-
clude the sciences in his definition. If I 
were defining a liberal education, I 
would at least include the sciences." 


If Giamatti failed to attend to such 
concerns because more mundane 
troubles kept him too busy, his deci-
sion 
to retire seems somewhat 
mysterious. Why would he choose to 
leave when the strike's end meant the 
first problem-free horizon for Yale 
since Giamatti had become president? 


If there were ever a time when Giamat-
ti could advance his educational agen-
da-and he surely does have one-it is 
now, when Yale is free of the financial 
and labor troubles that occupied so 
much of Giamatti's time in the past. 


There are numerous rumors why 
Giamatti is leaving- to attend to his 
health and his family life, to name 
two- but none of them fully explains 
why a president at the peak of his 
power, having spent more than half his 
life at Yale, would choose to step down. 


The answers are rooted eight years in 
the past, in Giamatti's own mixed feel-
ings about becoming president. 


In 
the sudden transition from 
private to public figure, G iamatti was 
forced to give up P.asttimes he loved. 
The greatest sacrifice was teaching, 
but there were other losses: writing, 
meeting with students, spending time 
in libraries- the day-to-day activities 
of a man in the thick of Yale life, rather 
than distantly above it. Giamatti 
remembers, "I said in my interview 
[with the Corporation] that I was not 
the kind of person .they wanted, and I 
had no interest in being a butcher. I 
didn't see myself as a person who was 
going to slash budgets. I was candid 
about the fact that I wasn't someone 
who I would have thought they would 
have come to." At the time, Giamatti 
predicted that he would only serve as 
president for seven years. 


Publicly, Giamatti reconciled 
himself to his new role. Still, one 
senses that privately he has never been 
completely comfortable trying to be 
president and teacher, administrator 
and educational spokesman all at once. 


That struggle to be the "Renaissance 
Man" has exacted 
a 
tremendous 
physical and personal toll on Giamatti. 


Moreover, he worries that in staying 
longer he risks losing the respect he has 
acquired. 


"I never want to be one of those peo-
ple of whom they're saying in parking 
lots and hallways, 'When's he going to 
go?"' Giamatti says. "Because that's too 
late. And I didn't want to come to a 
point where I had a feeling of defend-
ing what I had done- saying well, yes, 
we had to do all that renovation 
because it was so necessary. Or yes, I 
didn't do that because we were 
rebuilding faculty salaries. Then I 
think the institution slows down. It 
keeps pace with you; it's patient, it 
waits. But the place deserves to keep 
moving at a certain momentum." 


Giamatti says these words with con-
viction. Undoubtedly he thinks it best 
for Yale and himself that he move on, 
but his choices are limited. H e has 


turned down offers to go into politics, 
and he almost certainly will not go into 
business. Being president of another 
university or a foundation would prob-
ably strike Giamatti as redundant or 
anticlimactic. 


In truth, there are surprisingly few 
options for a former president of Yale, 
especially one who is as proud as 
Giamatti. Other presidents have 
retired after leaving office, 
and 
presidents have 
died in 
office. 
Kingman Brewster is now master of an 
Oxford college. But Giamatti is far 
younger than all of them were, and 
even he doesn't seem to know what the 
job market holds for ex-Yale 
presidents. 


Of course, Giamatti has spent the 
majority of his life as an academic, and 
many faculty members have told him 
they would like to see him return to 
Yale 
to teach again. 
Giamatti, 
however, 
is pessimistic about the 
possibility. There are enemies made 
over the years to consider, the problem 
of catching up with a decade's worth of 
scholarship, the difficulty of downshift-
ing 
from president to 
faculty 
member, and the awkwardness his 
presence at Yale might mean to 
President-designate Benno Schmidt. 


For a man who loves Yale as much as 
Giamatti does, such a threatened 
separation is more like exile. Giamatti 
can't help but be aware of how ironic it 
is for a president who has always 
stressed the importance of choice at 
Yale to find that he has little choice but 
to leave Yale, never to return except as 
a visitor. 


"I've been here about as long as I 
thought I should be," Giamatti says 
softly. "You should know when enough 
is enough. You should do it just for the 
sheer joy of doing it, because the place 
deserves better than just repetition." 


He pauses. "Then let somebody else 
do it. This isn't my career. I mean, I 
do like it. I used to get asked that ques-
tion five, six, seven years ago, and I 
wasn't so sure. Now, if you say to me, 
'Are you having fun?' I'd say, 'Yes. I 
enjoy the job.' And I will miss it.•

Growing into Motherhood 
Susan Orenstein 
In 
New H aven, the frequency of 
teenage pregnan1 y has become great 
enough to warrant its own statistic. 
Each year, the c..ny records hundreds of 
new births to teenage girls, ~orne of 
them as young as 13. Once they leave 
the hospital, they wiJJ begin to adjust 
their lives, at school and at home, to 
accomodate the demands of their 
children. Long after the city's books 
are put away each year, teenage 
mothers will continue to encounter 
problems and constraints which 
statistics never reveal. 

The Hill Health Center in New 
Haven reports that, citywide, 449 
teenage girls had children in 1983, the 
most recent year statistics were 
available. While startling, the high 
number of teen mothers in New Haven 
reflects a national problem that has

public.

the Planned Parenthood Federation 
picture a girl behind a school desk who 
asks, "Do I look like a mother to you?" 
The problem has been considered so 
important by Time that it featured teen 
mothers on a recent December cover. 

For a teenager, a baby alters both 
her body and her personal identity, 
and she finds herself caught between 
school and motherhood. Since many of 
New Haven's teenagers already come 
from a life of inner-city poverty, 
motherhood creates both increased 
financial strain and reasons to drop out 
of school. The city has instituted pro-
grams to help young mothers function 
with their babies and has made ef-
forts aimed at prevem:on, but if the 
number of out-of-wedlock births to 
New Haven teenagers does not 
decrease, teen pregnancy may become 
too commonplace to reverse. 

In New Haven, the best sources for 
insight into the problem are the young 
mothers themselves. Michelle, who is 
18 and lives with her father and step-
mother in New Haven, sat and talked 
one day in school after making up a 
test. Her hands were folded over her 
stomach, and she looked down at them 
when she thought about the baby. "I 
just didn't think I could get pregnant," 
she said. "I was doing good, four whole 
years (without contraception), and 
then I popped up pregnant this year." 

Michelle's belief in her security comes 
naturally to adolescents who don't 
want to worry beyond the present. A 
task force of the Planned Parenthood

"l just didn't think I 
could get pregnant. I 
was doing good, four 
whole years (without 
contraception), and 
then I popped up 
pregnant this year." 

Federation reports that only one in 
seven adolescents comes to a clinic 
before having sex, and the delay be-
tween first intercourse and first con-
traception 
is usually .six months. 

Michelle found out about her preg-
nancy last August and since then has 
given up her hope to join the Navy. 
Now she plans to go to college part-
time at night but will wait until her 
child is at least one year old. 

In New Haven, teenagers accounted 
for 20 percent of the total number of 
women who gave birth in 1983. Within 
Connecticut, the teen pregnancy rate 
was reported at 10 percent, twice as 
high as national figures. But even at 
five percent, the United States has the 
highest rate in the western world, and 
the only one still rising, according to a 
recent study by the Guttmacher In-
stitute. Reporting on developed coun-
tries, the study cited openness about 
sex as the crucial factor in controlling 
teen pregnancy. For example, in 1975 
Sweden and the United States had 
comparable teen pregnancy rates, but 
since then Sweden has liberalized its 
abortion laws and mandated 
sex 
education, issues still under debate in 
the U.S. Sweden now has a teen 
pregnancy rate less than half that of the 
United States. 

Christine, a 16-year-old at Hillhouse 
High School in New Haven, would 
have benefited from better sex educa-
tion. Part of the problem was how her 
own mother approached the topic of 
sex. "As soon as I got my period," she 
said, "all my mom said was 'You better 
not get pregnant.'" Left at that, such a 
statement ignored crucial issues about 
sex, particularly contraception. 

Though she wanted to avoid having a 
baby, Christine was using birth control 
incorrectly when she became preg-
nant. According to Kathleen London, 
head of a program at Hillhouse for 
school-age parents, a girl may actually 
ask her mother for birth control and 
then go ahead with sex even if her 
mother says no. Living on welfare with 
a daughter 10 months old, Christine 
says that preventing another baby is on her 
mind every day, largely because she 
doesn't think she could withstand 
another 25-hour delivery. 

Recent studies of teen pregnancy 
show that the problem is not limited to 
girls of poverty like Christine. Subur-
ban areas have seen an increase in 
pregnant teenagers, with more girls 
carrying their pregnancies to term. But 
the extremely high rate of pregnancy 
in New Haven indicates that poverty 
makes the problem worse. Dr. James 
P. 
Comer, 
professor of child 
psychiatry at the Yale Medical School, 
believes that a breakdown in the com-
munity accompanied by early ex-
posure to sex causes the teen preg-
nancy rate to rise. Among people who 
are most marginal in any society, such 
as farm women in Europe, the rates 
are highest. According to Comer, New 
Haven suffers because teenagers here 
do not sense they have a chance for 
economic success and lack a reason rot 
to have a child at a young age. 

In fact, in New Haven, many girls 
find numerous reasons w haue babies. 
Michelle thinks some girls are like her, 
arriving at their pregnancies by 
mistake, while some become pregnant 
because their friends do. They either 
see having a baby as a sign of maturity 
or as just something to love. And the 
sight of other girls with babies brings 
the idea home, making it more im-
mediate and plausible. A mother in 
school, 
Sharon looked like any 
appearance-conscious teenager walk-
ing down the hall, her lipstick freshly 
applied even near the end of the day. 
But with a two-year-old son, her time 
is spent taking care of a baby as well as 
herself. Sharon was not using birth 
control when she became pregnant in 
the eighth grade. "The problem with 
girls is they don't have their mother to 
talk to them about sex. I knew I could 
get pregnant but at the time I wanted 
the experience." Aside from curiosity 
about sex, many teenage girls may also 
gain a sense of gratification from 
having a child. In an article he wrote 
for The Crisis magazine, Dr. Comer 
claimed that having a child often com-
pensates for a lack of success in family 
life, school, or employment. 

In his article, Dr. Comer also discussed 
the male motivation behind teen 
pregnancy. "Closed out of an oppor-
tunity for economic adequacy too 
many black males turn to sexu.al con-
quest as a major source of a sense of 
adequacy," he wrote. Evelyn Elliot, 
who graduated from Hillhouse last 
spring with a 15-month-old son, agrees 
with Dr. Comer. She sees how, in her 
community, males will rely on sexual 
prowess and experience to shape their 
self-image. "A lot of girls I know, the 
fathers are around, just around," she 
said. "He likes to say 'yes, this is my 
son,' but when it comes to respon-
sibility he's not there . . . . See, we grow 
up and get more mature because we go 
through the whole nine months. But 
they don't, so they go out and do what 
they were doing. All they realize is 'I 
got a son.' Guys on my street go brag-
ging 'I got three babies.' And other 
ones say 'I hear you, man.'" 

Problems with self-esteem also 
plague the girls themselves, leading 
some into young motherhood. 
Especially when the teenager has been 
physically abused as a child, she may 
get pregnant as a part of her fantasy to 
bring her mother back into her life. 
The most belligerent mothen, London



says, often pay more attention to a girl 
when she is pregnant, and there have 
even 
been "false 
pregnancies" in 
response to severe abuse. 

For such varied reasons, 9,498 
teenagers actually became pregnant in 
Connecticut in 1983, and over half of 
them terminated the pregnancy in 
abortion. London says that despite the 
city's high birth rate there are more 
abortions in New Haven than people 
realize. Manv of these abortions, 
however, occur among girls who either 
later do become teen mothers or who 
already have a child. A recent article in 
Connecticut magazine provided 
evidence suggesting that suburban 
white girls are more likely to have 
abortions than urban blacks. Accor-
ding to Dr. Coll)er, in the lower-income 
urban communities of New Haven, 
seeing other people have early sexual 
experiences and babies creates a com-
munity trend. "Many middle-class 
families are not going to keep your 
baby for you," Dr. Comer said. He added 
that, while low-income communities in 
New Haven have experien-ced a degree 
of deterioration, some families are 
more willing to help raise children 
because it is their only usable skill. At 
Hillhous_e, 
17-year-old Beth is 
sometimes late for school and has to 
start her day at the attendance office. 
She tells the annoyed secretary there 
that she was busy with her daughter 
and came to school as soon as she 
could. Beth says she is fortunate to 
come to school at all, because her 
mother watches her baby during the 
day. In another family, however, 
Sylvia wonders how she will stay in 
school, since her mother, at age 33, 
doesn't necessarily want to watch the 
children while she is in class. In order 
to finish high school, Sylvia meets her 
cousin at 7:45 a.m. to give her the 
baby for the morning, and h~r best 
friend, the baby's godmother, helps 
watch him in the afternoon. 

a 
decision about it, the 12-week 
deadline may preclude abortion, 
unless they are willing to travel to 
Bridgeport or other places outside the 
city. According to London, Yale/New 
Haven Hospital is 
reluctant to 
use medicaid for abortions because it 
receives federal funds and does not 
want to run counter to the current 
administration's policy. Cur-
rently, an effort by Connecticut to 
discontinue state medicaid for abor-
tions is pending decision in court, and 
plans to balance the federal budget 
threaten grants provided to Women's 
Health Services. 

For some girls, whether or not toter-
minate a pregnancy depends not on 
cost considerations but on die moral or 
religious issues surrounding abortion. 
Michelle, for example, said, "I don't 
like abortion 'cause you're killing 
something that's alive. There's no 
reason that I should have gotten an 
abortion. I mean, I could see if I was 
raped." Within her church, a girl faces 
a split in opinion concerning her 
motherhood. Becoming pregnant out-
of-wedlock is viewed as wrong, but go-
ing through with the birth is the right 
decision, and the church will support it 
over an abortion. 

Aside from the potential for family 
support and the example set by teen 
mothers in the community, other fac-
tors often influence a girl's decision to 
have her baby. At an estimated cost of 
$225, affording an abortion is one bar-
rier to terminating a pregnancy. Both 
Planned Parenthood and the Women's 
Health Services, Inc. may perform 
abortions covered by state medicaid, 
though they will provide services only 
through the first 12 weeks of pregnan-
cy. For girls who have trouble accept-
ing their pregnancy, let alone making

teenagers m New Haven will have 
their babies, the city responded 20 
years ago with the opening of an alter-
native school for pregnant girls. The 
school has recently changed locations, 
and on a trip down Columbus Avenue, 
a billboard gives the first welcome to 
the neighborhood, its bold black letters 
reading "Having a Baby? We Deliver!" 
The Polly T. McCabe building, identi-
fied by a hand-written sign in the win-
dow, 
is 
school 
for hundreds of 
teenagers each year. Within the school 
system, Polly McCabe receives about 
90 percent of the city's pregnant girls, 
the official count last year being 211. 
Most of them black or Hispanic, their 
ages range from 12 to 20, or from si.xth 
to 12th grade. 

A key purpose of McCabe is to make 
the pregnant teen feel ~omfortable by 
offering her the company of others in 
the same situation. The entrance to the 
school has a round table that serves as 
a student lounge, and in between 
classes pregnant girls gather there, 
talking and laughing together. Mc-
Cabe seeks to help students not only 
socially but educationally, and the sub-
jects written on the classroom doors 
resemble those of other schools: social 
studies, English, home economics. 
· The program aims at keeping girls in 
school throughout their pregnancy, so 
that they can either graduate or con-
tinue In regular schools such as 
Hillhouse. 

For -Michelle, attending McCabe 
this year will mean a high school 
diploma as well as something equally 
vital: lessons in mothering. "I'm scared 
... 'cause I don't know nothing about 
babies," she said. "I'm scared I might 
get up in the middle of the night and be 
angry for getting up." When she first 
found out she was pregnant, Michelle 
also feared the pain of childbirth. To 
help prepare for labor, she takes a class 
at McCabe on childbirth and health 
that meets twice a week. The room is 
also used for delivery exercises, so on 
those days it is empty of desks and

a student at Southern Connecticut State University where she helps counsel 
teenagers about preventing pregnancy. 
chairs. More than the open space, the 
posters on the walls show that the 
classroom is far from ordinary. One 
presenting a series of pictures is called 
"Stages of Labor," and another, on the 
other side of the room, reads "How a 
Baby Grows." 

Michelle says she feels more in-
volved with school now than before her 
pregnancy, and one reason could be 
the personally important issues she en-
counters in class. Taught by Adair Lu-
ciani, "Childbirth and Health" deals 
w1th delivery, nutritional information, 
birth control, and family dynamics. 
Ironically, Luciani finds that the girls 
in her classroom are in many ways 
naive. "The swingers know enough to 
use birth control," she said. "The ones 
who get pregnant are the innocents." 
Michelle, not realizing she could get 
pregnant after four years of sex 
without birth control, is an example of 
such innocence. Her face is covered 
with freckles, making her protruding 
stomach incongruous with her youth. 
She realized she was pregnant when 
she called her mother after being sick 
for a while. "We just took it as a joke, I 
guess, I don't know. She didn't yell, 
she didn't get mad or nothing. She 
said, 'If you throw up phlegm then 
you're pregnant.' I was throwing up, 
and my mother said 'I guess I'll be a 
grandmother.'" 

As soon as she delivers her baby, 
Michelle will face difficulties that Lu-
ciani's class may not have prepared her 
for. After having people worry about· 
her while pregnant, she will start wor-
rying about her own baby. And her 
goals to finish school and get a job will 
become more difficult than she im-
agined. She will already break the pat-
tern of 50 to 85 percent of teenage 
mothers nationwide by finishing high 
school. Going on to college would be 
exceptional, as well as draining. 

Addressing the problem of high 
dropout rates among young mothers, 
Lee High School in New Haven in-
twduced a program eight years ago 
designed to keep teenage parents in 
school. Today, all three high schools in 
New Haven have programs, but only 
Hillhouse employs a teacher full time. 
London, who ran 
the 
program's 
original model, is currently the teacher 
at Hillhouse. Having formerly worked 
at McCabe, she believes the hardest 
work for young mothers comes after 
the baby is born. London believes that 
many of the 111 students enrolled in 
her program this year find that they 


are separated from other girls in 
school. "I do think some of the other 
girls view it sadly as a loss of their 
teenage friends, and it is," she said. 
"But I don't think they pass moral 
judgment at all." 

Still, the student mother recognizes 
the split in what she deals with at home 
and at school all in the same day. "I'm 
still a teenager," Beth said defiantly. "I 
don't have to be grown. I don't have to 
cut my fun out because I'm still young. 
I'm notgoingto play the grown role yet 
. . . but I like being around older peo-
ple. Young girls, they act too silly. You 
know, smart remarks about the baby." 

Before she comes to school, Beth gets 
up at 5:30 or six a.m., checks on the 
baby and changes her. She wishes she 
could take care of her daughter during 
the day, and she also wishes she could 
earn her own money. Beth sees her 
younger sister, who is pregnant now, 
as a source of conflict, not as someone 
following her own lead. With two 
babies in the family, Beth thinks she 
won't have as much money allotted to 
her as before. 

Sharon, who helped · others with 
their babies before becoming a mother, 
thinks she was ready for the respon-
sibility. Separation from peers does not 
concern her, because most of her 
friends now have babies. Even though 
having a child out-of-wedlock trapped 
Sharon and other teenagers into pover-
ty, their motherhood serves to bring 
them together. She wishes she could 
have had her own son when she wasn't 
a student, but her friends provide the 
emotional support which makes 
motherhood bearable. Still,- among her 
friends with babies, Sharon does feel 
distanced from the ones who don't stay in 
school and says they use motherhood as 
an excuse to drop out. 

Young mothers in New Haven face 
alienation because school is designed 
for teenagers who do not have to worry 
about dependent children. Trying to 
be both students and mothers, teenage 
girls may feel successful as neither. In


order to resolve the conflict, they may 
choose a single identity and abandon 
school because motherhood comes 
first . Remarkably, New Haven has a 
drop-out rate for teen mothers of only 
18 percent, a figure far below the na-
tional average. The city's school-age 
parents' program plays a major role in 
keeping young mothers in school 
because it removes them from an 
alienating environment for one period 
each day. Everything in London's 
room, for example, speaks directly to 
them. A table in the corner is covered 
wtth pamphlets that include informa-
tion on, among other things, birth con-
trol, drinking and pregnancy, men and 
sex, and sexually transmitted diseases. 
Across the room from the pamphlets, a 
bulletin board displays pictures of 
babies born to London's students. 

Along with troubles at school, teen 
mothers often must face 
difficult 
choices within their own homes. One 
of the concerns that differs from 
mother to mother is the specific finan-
cial situation of her family and the way 
she supports her baby. Rules govern-
ing state aid are confusing, even in-
timidating, and teenagers may not 
understand what is available to them. 
London will call and even visit the 
welfare office and then explain the in-
formation to her students. Currently, a 
major problem for young mothers is 
that they do not receive the welfare 
award for their babies while living at 
home. In late 1984, the state transfer-
red responsibility for the babies to the 
maternal and paternal grandparents, 
so that they receive the added award 
instead of the mothers. The new policy 
seeks to make parents more respon-
sible 
for 
their teenagers' sexual 
behavior, but it has the adverse effect· 
of leading young mothers out on their: 
own. Some of them are genuinely 
more responsible than their parents 
and feel a great need to control the 
baby's funds. But to do so, they must 
declare their independence, and many 
will move out only to face increased 
poverty. London says some young 
mothers end up with no place to live as 
a result of the new policy, and others 
may resort to lying to evade the law. 

Christine is one young mother in 
New H aven who moved out of her 
house so that she could receive welfare 
compensation for her baby directly. 
Though she says she hates being "on 
state," Christine 
became too 
frustrated living with her mother. 
"When my mother was getting my 
money, I wasn't getting anything at all. 
I wish I could move back and still get 
it," she said. With her own apartment 
near her mother's house; Christine 
comes home from school and confronts 
the tasks of running a household. Plan-
ning her monthly budget, she always 
sets aside enough for two spare boxes 
of Pampers. "Mrs. London's class is 
the only reason I come to school," 
Christine said. "Otherwise I would 

For Sylvia, life in her mother's house 
has also proved difficult, and she plans 
to move out soon. Finishing out the 
year at Polly McCabe, her son just 
three months old, Sylvia talked while 
her two-year-old daughter fell asleep 
on her lap. The baby, holding ~nto her 
mother's shirt, had two braids fastened 
with Raggedy 
Ann 
barettes, 
braiding part of her mother's daily 
routine. Sylvia says her own mother, 
who became a single parent when she 
was 15, challenges her role with the 
children. "I can't feed my son when I 
want," Sylvia said. "I can't change 
him when I want. There's a certain 
time I can play with my child." 
certain time I can play with my child." 
Her mother gives her $140 a month to 
live on and also pays for her food, but 
Sylvia plans to receive S500 a month 
paying a low rent at her aunt's house. 
Sylvia finds that most of her friends 
from 
high 
currently 
have 
babies, and she knows of only one who 
is married. For most young mothers, 
marriage does not coincide with hav-
ing a baby, and the ones who do re-
main with their baby's father often feel 
unusual. Although she has a new 
boyfriend, Sylvia considers her 
children the most important part of her 
life, and she wants to go to college and 
open a home for young mothers. Col-
lege is a way for her to escape a 
dependence on welfare, and she is 
eager both to support herself and to get 
married. "I'd like to be married but 
there ain't no boy dumb enough to 
marry someone with two kids already," 
she said. She would have married her 
babies' father, but speaking of him now 
brings her noticeable pain. With a 
disillusioned outlook on men, she says 
they are like little children even though 
they can be fathers. She finds it painful 
to answer her daughter's questions 
about her father anr:l think-: abo11t pro-
tecting her son from his example. 

Evelyn, with a two-year-old son, 
went through different stages of emo-
tions regarding her baby's father. "I felt 
like at first I didn't want my baby's 
father to have anything to do with me 
and my baby," she said. "Then I felt 
selfish, like I should let him be with his 
child. Then I felt like maybe I rushed 
him. But he's never around. I don't 
think he deserves this baby. Guys get 
what they want, then they leave. This 
isn't what I wanted in him. The love 
that you thought you had is gone." 

Currently, her son's father has another 
baby, born to the teenager who lives 
next door to Evelyn. Evelyn feels 
resentful when he will not help take 
care of her baby and then goes into the 
house next door. She says she knows a 
number of young mothers who receive 
financial 
help from 
their babies' 
fathers, but most of the love and emo-

tional support go out of the relation-
ship. Her own son calls his father by 
his first name since he knows him more 
in the caoacity of friend than of "Dad-
dy." 

Throughout New Haven, 
many 
young mothers expect that, for the 
time being at least, they will live on 
their own. Though many of them cur-
rently have boyfriends, these men are not 
necessarily 
expected 
to 
become 
husbands. Beth, who is still together 
with her baby's father, doesn't think he 
will be the ma n she will marry. "You 
can't expect to stay with your baby's 
father 
forever," she said, "because 
pretty soon he'll break loose. H e don't 
want no woman with babies all the 
time." Michelle, who has watched her 
parents, her brother and her friend all 
suffer troubled marriages and separa-
tions, has turned down her boyfriend's 
proposal. "I don't want to get m arried," 
she said. "I did, but I don't want to 
now. H e got the ring, but I told him I 
didn't want it. Marriage, that's a scary 
word because then they feel that they 
own you. They got papers saying 
you're his or whatever. You can't just 
go your way and he go his way." 

Though Michelle's outlook is sober-
ing, current statistics show that her 
chances for a successful marriage are 
not very good . A task force on teen 
pregnancy in Connecticut reported 
that marital disruption within 15 years 
is three times more likely for women 
who become mothers between the ages 
of 14 and 17 than for those who wait 
until after they are 20. For women 
becoming mothers at ages 18 or 19, the 
likelihood for disruption is two times as 
great. Aside from a troubled marriage, 
poverty is also more likely for a 
teenage mother. Families headed by 
young mothers are seven times more 
likely to live in poverty, and in 1984, 
58 percent of Connecticut's Aid to 
Families with Dependent Children 
(AFDC), or welfare, went to women 
who were teen mothers. 

The figures for children born to 
young mothers are equally troubling. 
Teenagers are twice as likely to have 
low birth-weight babies than mothers 
who are ages 20 to 24, and in 1983 
New Haven's infant mortality rate was 
23 deaths per 1,000 live births. This 
figure was more than double the state 
rate of 10.1 and the national rate of 
11.5. In addition, New H aven had a 
nine percent rate of low birth-weight as 
compared to the state's 6.4 percent and 
the U.S.'s 6.8 percent. According to 
Bob Kilpatrick at the Hill H ealth 
Center, being both poor and a teen-
ager automatically places a young 
mother in higher risk of having a baby 
who is below weight or unable to sur-
vive. H e cites problems such as low in-
come, language and cultural barriers, 
lack of transportation, and fear of 
medical a id as some reasons why 
young mothers do not receive better 
prenatal care. 

The generation of babies being born 
to black teen mothers faces other 
disturbing predictions. The Children's 
Defense Fund in W ashington, D.C. 
wrote in 1985 that "Our principal con-
elusion is that black children are 
sliding backwards." The report also 
says that black teenage girls are three 
times as likely to die during childbirth. 
Babies of black teen mothers are four 
times as likely to live with neither 
parent and be supervised by child 
welfare and five times as likely to be 
dependent on welfare and becom e 
pregnant as teens. For New Haven, 
such predictions give a grim outlook 
for the future, since nearly 20 percent 
of the female school population has 
children each year. 

In searching for a solution to New 
Haven's problem, Comer says it is dif-
ficult for teenagers to break away from 
community trends because the com-
munity provides their base of emo-
tional support. A large ' gap exists be-
tween the immediate environment in 
which m any teenagers have children 
and the outside community that is 
more ready to reject such a practice. 
Comer suggests the idea of "bridge 
people," such as church leaders or 
teachers, who work from within the 
community to provide mainstream at-
titudes, values, and skills. To aid 
teenagers in New Haven who need a 
strong academic program that will 
motivate them towards jobs, Comer is 
currently working at Hillhouse to 
develop the curriculum and address 
health issues, including teen pregnan-
cy. London believes that fathers should 
also have increased opportunity for 
vocational training. "They feel they 
should be fmancially responsible, and 
yet they are for the most part unable," 
London said. 

Young mothers in New Haven, 
recognizing that teen pregnancy is a 
problem, do not know how to change 
it. Beth said, "Everybody you know is 
pregnant. And it's sad too 'cause there's 
nothing you 
can do 
for 
them." 
Christine, shaking her head, added, 
"Best thing I could tell them is to take 
the pill every day." Thinking for a mo-
ment, she expanded her advice. "Tell 
them how hard it is," she said. "If you


---

do have sex, make sure you have 
double protection." Hoping to tell 
teenage girls how hard it is before they 
get pregnant is one of the objectives of 
a newly formed project in New Haven 
called Helping Others Win. Founded 
by Evelyn Elliot last spring, the pro-
gram originally called for visiting the 
elderly in convalescent homes and then 
began discussing sex and pregnancy 
with teenagers. Elliot and her partner 
in the organization, Dinah Milton, 
also try to encourage young mothers to 
remain in school after giving birth. "At 
graduation , we felt like we should've 
been respected more highly than any-
one else because we had children. I felt 
like I was gonna burst and cry and do 
everything at the same time," Elliot 
said. She and Milton have been 
visiting classrooms since last year but 
ultimately want to open an office 
where teenagers won't be afraid to talk. 

Another independent program, Life 
H aven Inc., plans to open a shelter for 
pregnant teenagers and mothers in the 
greater New H aven area to provide 
housing, counseling, and follow-up 
work. T he project has aiready received 
50 requests for help, though it will ac-
commodate only 12 girls at once when it 
opens this summer. 

Meanwhile, New Haven's city-run 
programs continue to provide some 
essential services. Connecticut magazine 
last May reported that London's 
school-age parents program has re-
duced the number of young mothers 
who become pregnant a second time 
within two years to eight percent, com-
pared to 60 percent nationwide, and it



has also helped to keep young mothers 
in school. At Yale, several researchers, 
headed by Vicky Seitz in the Child 
Studies Center, have interviewed 145 
young mothers since 1981. Their re-
sults show that mothers who attend 
McCabe go on to have increased 
educational success, 
as 
well 
healthier babies. 

Despite their positive effects, New 
H aven's programs do not reach the 
core of the city's teen pregnancy prob-
lem. 
Teenagers isolated 
from 
economic opportunity will not find. 
compelling reasons to avoid having 
children, and their futures will be d ic-
tated by adjustments to motherhood 
instead of academic or career goals. 
Daily, such young women will face 
questions concerning their child's 
welfare, the possib ility of dropping 
out, and the sufficiency of their AFDC 
check. Some believe, however, that 
they can attain a future apart from 
these problems, perhaps one of securi-
ty. "In five years," Beth said, "I hope to 
be in my last year of college, finding 
me a good nursing job. I want one 
more baby, I want to be married." 
T hen, smiling a bit, she said what she 
really wanted: "I want to go to Europe. 
I want a fresh start and take my family 
with me and be happy."
