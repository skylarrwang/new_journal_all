sixties was followed by the selection 
of Charles Moore, the king of 
creative, humane and zooty modem 
architecture, as Dean of the Archi-
tecture School. Yale became a focus 
of a movement of architectural design 
which has since swept America; the 
university's strong faculty and long 
history of architecture as a series of 
sensitive images constructing a care-
fully defined world placed it in a 
leading position. It is no coincidence 
that such men as Robert Venturi 
("Complexity and Contradiction in 
Modern Architecture"), Charles 
Moore, Louis Kahn and Vincent 
Scully were all connected with Yale. 
The most obvious product of this 
movement was Venturi's design for 
the new mathematics building and the 
competition which produced it. The 
design called for a re-use of some of 
the materials prevalent on Hillhouse 
Avenue and a graceful gesture to the 
mansions up the hill. It represented a 
complete surrender to the desires of 
the present and future users of the 
building and, as such, it was an 
unexciting structure symbolic of 
Yale's retrenchment. The money for 
the math building was to come from 
that left-over plan from the corporate 
image days, the dismally faltering 
Campaign for Yale. 
The most successful and most 
succinct modern statement of the Yale 
image which this new awareness 
produced is the British Art Center. 
When Paul Mellon gave the money 
and the collections for this center, he 
envisioned the building as a trans-
mitter of the values of humanist order 
that were to him the central feature of 
seventeenth century English culture. 
To Mellon, Yale is very clearly a 
continuation of this elitist, creative, 
humanistic and rationalistic society, 
and the design of the Center was to 
be, as Director Jules Prown put it, 
"suffused with these qualities." Archi-
tect Louis Kahn, a former faculty 
member, emphasized over and over 
again his view that our present-day 
society could only be saved by re-
imbuing its institutions with meaning, 
a process in which architecture was 
extremely important. 
The building he created focuses 
very heavily on courtyards and the 
importance of the interaction of 
human beings in a public space. It 
also creates a world that is completely 
understandable to the human mind 
and recalls the luxurious setting in 
which a Yale Man, along with his 
spiritual ancestors at Oxford and 
Cambridge (Mellon attended this last 
institution) would feel at home. The 
aggressive tower is gone from the 
traditional imagery, perhaps because 
of Yale's new humility. Instead, the 
tower is inside, in the form of the 
great concrete stairwell which is the 
actual and spiritual focus of the 
building. 
On the outside, the building's 
greyness is a combination of a grey 
flannel J. Press suit and a grey New 
Haven day, the reserved elitism of 
Yale and the realities of a North-
eastern big city. The Center is a large 
jewelbox, like Beinecke, protective of 
its valuable interior, but, like the 
Rogers colleges, it helps define the 
city in opposition to and in inter-
action with its process of self-
enclosure. As such it is perhaps the 
finest statement of modern architec-
ture at Yale, the complete model for 
the present-day Yale Man. 
Yale architecture continues to 
search for ways of expressing the 
university's role in a dialogue with the 
city. "We let the city in very early on 
in the design process," says Ed 
Dunne, Yale's Director of Facilities 
Planning. "We are very concerned . 
with the quality of New Haven life." 
"Yale has opened up considerably," 
agrees John McGuerty, head of New 
Haven's City Planning. "We are 
consulted pretty early on .... In 
general, I'd say that the buildings on 
the Yale campus are among the most 
successful urban structures of the 
country. They really define the street, 
the courtyards are magnificent .... 
Now Giurgola in the design for the 
Whitney Avenue Colleges was going 
to have these external courtyards. 
That's baloney, it just doesn't work." 
Yale's courtyards are obviously not 
meant for New Haven. 
There are some areas of tension. A 
large institution means a lot of cars, 
and McGuerty believes the parking 
lots that surround Yale destroy the 
city environment. "Hell," he says, 
"I've got to keep pushing." There also 
remains an undying hatred between 
such men as McGuerty and Scully, 
who tried to save City Hall from the 
zealous hands of city planners: two 
different value systems clashed, and 
probably will continue to clash, 
though the city seems to have grown 
more sensitive to the Scully-esque 
arguments for the preservation of 
urban identity, as Yale tries to 
respond to New Haven's outcries. 
Yale has committed itself to a 
policy of "filling in the gaps between 
the teeth," as Barnes puts it. No 
major new buildings are planned. The 
emphasis is now on the extensive re-
use of existing buildings. The fore-
most example of this is Herb 
Newman's and Barnes' design for the 
Old Campus renovations. "We tried to 
bring back the atmosphere of the 
original rooms," Newman says. His 
j __________ 
_ 
design -
six units around a very 
large communal living room -
is a 
miniature version of the courtyard. 
Just as noteworthy is the set of 
fashionable East Side images evoked 
by the new rooms: smooth white 
walls, highly polished wood floors and 
skylights looking out over the city. 
They seem a promise of what the 
modern Yale Freshperson has to look 
forward to after graduation -
a nice 
reward for fulfilling Yale's objectives. 
The rooms are also interesting in 
that they were designed in close 
cooperation with the students, faculty 
and administration. Everybody is now 
concerned about what building means 
at Yale, what its values and implica-
tions are. Dunne and Newman like to 
point out the degree in which the total 
Yale population is now involved in 
the design of Yale buildings. As 
Dunne says: "We do talk about what 
a Yale building means, what that 
involves in the design, with every-
body. We think that the talented 
architects who have built here have 
each come up with their own inter-
pretation, and that they have built, 
without exception, quite successful 
buildings." "Yes," Scully affirmed, 
"there is very definitely a way in 
which Yale architects have worked in 
a great tradition, within the frame-
work of what Yale as an instittttion 
means, worked with the image of the 
Yale Man." 
The students and faculty have 
resigned themselves to this elitist 
tradition, or have decided to work 
the new journal, May 2, 1978 
within it. The Lipstick has been 
quietly moved to a corner of Morse 
College, where it sits facing the 
Master's House and Saarinen's great 
tribute to the Yale Man, while almost 
no one remembers its revolutionary 
meaning. Yalies seem to accept their 
world of images, their fairyland, with 
varying degrees of pleasure and agita-
tion, once again molding themselves 
in the images the buildings provide 
for them. 
The contradictions of architecture 
at Yale continue nevertheless, for 
example at the new complex of 
buildings under construction for the 
School of Organization and Manage-
ment on Hillhouse and Trumbull 
Streets. For a branch of the university 
that expresses the pure power of the 
Yale image, Barnes designed a build-
ing that tries to hide itself completely 
behind the older, more humanistic 
order of the houses on Hillhouse, 
while asserting itself with a curious 
little pavilion reminiscent of a Pizza 
Hut. "One of Yale's problems right 
now," says Susan Ryan, an expert on 
Yale architecture who has taught a 
course here on the subject, "is that 
they realize that as an institution with 
a message their buildings have, in a 
sense, to be monuments. But the times 
we live in and their awareness of the 
problems of putting a new building in 
an old context leads them to deny 
that monumentality." Yale wants to 
state its meaning in its buildings, yet a
