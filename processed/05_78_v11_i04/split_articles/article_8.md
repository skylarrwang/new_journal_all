EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Green grass edges the billow of my sister's dress 
She is flagrantly on the ground, hours of sunlight 
On her face, a mind for daring and murmurous speech. 
Anxious to know a cloud's configuration, 
She will dance about now, pointing to the sky. 
I said, "No, Mary, your beauty is excessive. 
You will spin off like the petals on everyone's 
Favorite flower." She said, "Yes Yes Yes, 
Brother, for each there is love." 
She is the woman that I don't know. 
She is in chic silks in Asian cities 
At the moment. Pushpins hold her postcards. 
"Mary, do you see the broad slapdash cloud? 
It is a furious modern painting, tears of a tree." 
Had I been introduced I would have known her.
