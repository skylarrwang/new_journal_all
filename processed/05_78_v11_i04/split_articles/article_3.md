These ate the men and Karen of Yale 
baseball. These are the unsung suitors of 
Eli's spring. Of their travels and travails, 
their losses and their win, their days and 
mostly their nights, I sing. I am their muse. 
My music is their song. 

Saturday, March II. First of all, I 
should let you know. I'm no good -
that's both on the field and off it. 
Case in point: I just showed up fl.fteen 
minutes late (and without a pillow) 
for the bus (nicknamed Sputternick, 
after an incredibly sad knuckleball 
thrown by Ivan, our ambidextrous 
Russian transfer student) which is to 
chariot us to Florida for our aimual 
spring trip. This is no good. I'm not a 
starter and I don't have a pillow. 
Sputternick waits for no one, unless 
he has an ERA under 2.00 or a BA 
over 300. Or will eventually go on to 
play professional football. In the 
entire history of Yale baseball only 
two men have missed the bus and 
survived to tell about it -
Brian 
Dowling and Dick Jauron. But I 
don't want to play professional foot-
ball, and am, in fact, destitute of a 
pillow. 

At the bus I discover that everyone 
else is late as well, mostly hung over 
from a Rookie party held the night 
before. At 8:30A.M. Sputternick 
finally pulls out of Phelps Gate. We 
are heading down Route 95 to North 
Carolina, South Carolina, and Florida 
in order to play an eleven game 
schedule which is our version of the 
major league's spring training. Only 
our games count on our record, and 
we don't get paid. Our first day is to 
be spent entirely on the road, getting 
to know our Sputternick. With great 
circumspection we choose our seats 
and settle ourselves in cosily. We 
discover our Sputternick's innermost 
secrets, plumb her deepest caverns, 
and explore her tiniest crevices. We 
stop to check her pulse. Every so 
often we let her drink at a fast-food 
fountain. Once we pull over to the 
side of Route 95 and let her relieve 
herself. 

Choice of seats is actually quite 
important. A certain subtle hierarchy 
is mysteriously established as board-
ing proceeds. The front rows are 
occupied by Coach Kenzie (ex Eli, ex 
Met, and ex Expo) and his gang of 
card sharks, backgammon wizards, 
and assorted sycophants. These are 
the "moving men" of Eli baseball, the 
high-need achievers, the hustlers 
trying to crack the starting line-up or 
win millions of dollars in Topps 
chewing gum cards. All of them know 
that playing with Kenzie they can 
only win. If they whoop Coach at a 
game of black-jack, they can bribe 
him with the profits; if Coach whoops 
them (which never happens) they have 
succeeded in feeding his starved 
appetite for victory; they will be in the 
starting line-up the next day. 

In the middle of the bus are the 
vets. The guys with the pillows. 
In the back of the bus is Third 
World. And me. The rookies. When I 
selected my seat -
with astounding 
forethought -
for the privacy, quiet, 
and roadscape vista it apparently, 
and, indeed, actually affords, I failed 
to notice the large grey stall perched 
next to it in the corner. The notorious 
dumpster. Sputternick's tin tummy. I 
had unknowingly picked my place -
on a fully air-conditioned, all-window-
closed bus -
next to the most 
beloved seat. Some teammates drop 
by to visit. At first I think I'm 
popular. Later I detect a vaguely 
euphoric smile on the faces of my 
teammates as they return from the 
dumpster to their seats. Odors 
emanate. I consider emanating. I 
consider becoming odorous, but elect 
to become odious. I bar the aisle with 
the barricado of my legs and I rend 
the air with the howling of mystic 
incantations. 

A pit stop at a,.. hot spot somewhere 
in Virginia. Now we're on the road 
again. I have a baseball bat with me 
this time -
just in case the howling 
isn't enough of an arsenal to ward off 
any would-be defilers of the dumpster. 
I notice that Sputternick is beginning 
to lose velocity and fade anemicly to 
the right. Flashing lights. Some skin-
fead type in a navy blue get-up has 
pulled us over to the side of the road. 
"What's the matter,~ I moan drearily. 
"Copper," comes the reply from the 
front of the bus. 
"Quick, stash the stuff." 
Coach Kenzie turns around, be-
fuddled. 
"Bribe him," the shout goes up. 
"Yea, yea," peals of approval. 
Quickly, we pass around a baseball 
to get signatures from everyone on the 
team. Outside of the bus, the cop 
suddenly decides to let us go. The ball 
is ruined. 

The guys from Massachusetts make 
themselves evident. "Hey, look, aren't 
the trees weird down here." 
"Wait till you see the grass down in 
Kentucky." One of the vets. 
"No?" the Mass. boy replies, "Is it 
really blue?" 
"You bet," says Coach, "Our alums 
pay them to paint it for us." 

We are about to arrive at Wilming-
ton, North Carolina. It's II :30 at 
night and we've been on the road 
fifteen hours. Sputtemick sputters to 
a halt and the boys (and Karen) 
emerge woozily from their lofts and 
perches. Bodies descend from the 
luggage racks and crawl forth from 
beneath the seats. We enter our 
lodging for the night, and for the 
following three nights -
a former 
army barracks consisting of one 
dumpster and twenty-eight bunk beds 
lined side by side in a rectangular cell. 
Everyone grabs the bottom bunk 
except Moon Beamy (who likes the 
sensation of being high up). Once in 
bed, Cricket, a freshman, whips out a 
teddy bear, O.C., an Irishman, whips 
out his rosary, and Alvin, a music 
major, whips out something under-
neath his sheets. 

Suddenly, Coach Kenzie bursts into 
the barracks with Corporal Stanton, 
our trainer. Deferentially, I tap my 
heels together and salute .. 
"At ease, Private Pershan," allows 
Coach Kenzie. I put down the 
baseball bat and tuck it back under 
the sheets. I like sleeping with it; it 
makes me feel secure, like a clean-up 
hitter. And it reminds me of the Eli 
baseball motto: "If God had meant 
for his Elis to be hitters, they would 
have been born with bats between 
their legs." No wonder we can't hit. 
"Taps will be at midnight tonight, 
men," Coach announces, as a cannon 
goes off in the distance. Then Coach 
about-faces, and heads into town. As 
soon as he's out the door all the guys 
crack up in giant, jock giggles. "Chain 
dream, chain dream," comes the call 
from one of the beds. Uncle Wiggly, 
who is everyone's uncle and the best 
fairy-tale teller on the team, fishes out 
one of the rookies from his bed, and 
we proceed. 
"I'm thinking of something red and 
white with dots," Big Hags opens. 
"I told you not to get down on my 
mother," comes a shout of indignation 
from one of the beds. 
"Oh, oh, so you finally admit he 
got down on her." 
"Oh, foul ball, foul ball." The voice 
of Uncle Wiggly, who is also. our 
Captain and spiritual counselor. 
"She was, she was," the voice of 
Lowty, our general man-about-town, 
spiritual corruptor, and favorite guy. 
We got Lowty _through the Admis-
sion Office's special "You Name Him, 
We Tame Him" mail-away service. 
"That's enough fellas, knock it off," 
comes the stentorian voice of our 
leader, "We got a game tomorrow." 
"Jees, captain, did you have to spoil 
it," Goldy Lox, seconded by a chorus 
of whimpers. 

Sunday, March 12. At 11:00 we suit 
up for practice and sally forth to the 
battlefields. It is the first day we've 
been outside all season, so the guys all 
dress in T -shirts and gym shorts and 
try to ignore the cruel taunts of the 
scant spectators and the even crueler 
buffets of the wind. It is forty degrees 
warmer than it was in New Haven, or 
about 40°. Since this account is 
limited to what happened off the field, 
I cannot offer any report of the game, 
except to note that Moon Beamy 
made a spectacular diving catch and 
hit a home run. Neither of these 
events, of course, counted: the first 
occurring out of play, the second, in 
batting practice before the game. 

March 13. Our second day out and 
it's a beaut. We're on our famous 
sandwich schedule -
baseball, then a 
sandwich for lunch, then baseball.· But 
this time we win and there's cham-
pagne and euphoria in the locker 
room because we're spared our usual 
post-game jogging. That's real incen-
tive. We vow to win again the next 
day. 

That evening, at dinner, an Ivy 
Leaguer manque wearing topsiders 
and a Cornell crew sweat shirt sidles 
over to our table and introduces 
himself as Mark Davis. Now, we 
already know a Mark Davis, he's an 
outfielder on the Yale baseball team 
and one of the people to whom Mark 
Davis II has just introduced himself. 
Mark's southern twin ivy-league-ally 
slithers into some glib talk and winds 
up inviting the whole team to a 
southern-hospitality bash the next 
night. 

After dinner I trek across a sea of 
pine cones to visit the UNC library. 
My visit is made not so much out of 
any curiosity or need (I have; in fact, 
imported my own books from Yale, 
smuggled out of overnight reserve 
from CCL), as out of spite. It. makes 
my gut feel good. It makes Harkness 
Tower look taller. I sit in the 
reference room and smirk. I go to the 
bathroom and am happily appalled at 
the paucity and pissity of the 
grafeetity. On the walls of the stall I 
doodle tiny vignettes of Handsome 
Dan the XIV asserting himself man-
fully over Silly Willy III, the UNC 
mascot, a seagull. I feel honorable, 
pr..md, Bool-ish. 

Tuesday, March 14. I feel 
miserable. A New-Haven-like day. 
The air has that ubiquitous grey hue 
and sensation which makes us feel at 
home. Almost like eating at 
commoos. 

The game is frustrating, depressing, 
wounding. But we have agreed to 
attend Mark Davis Il's party after-
wards. He zips by at 9:00 in a TR 7 
two-seater. It takes nearly fourteen 
one-guest trips to shuttle us, but we 
finally arrive and, with the cold-
blooded calculation that only a Yalie 
could summon at such a moment, 
proceed to get totally trashed. The 
evening is very illuminating. At last 
we find out who the real hitters are. 
At 12:00 curfew we drive back to the 
barracks, but Moon Beamy, Big 
Hags, and Lowry stuff their beds with 
clothing, sticking caps on their pil-
lows, lower themselves out the 
windows with a rope improvised of 
bed sheets, and scatter into the 
woods. When they reappear the next 
morning, each sports at UNC at 
Wilmington T -shirt. Trophies. I make 
a mental note to visit the UNC 
bookstore first thing in the morning
