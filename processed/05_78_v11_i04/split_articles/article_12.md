Even good old Nathan Sterster 
Brewling Osborne doesn't have any 
input into the admissions process. 
Nathan can harass Carm all he wants, 
but he can't touch Worth David. 
There is an aura of something sacred 
in the admissions office, and when 
Worth says, "representative class," it 
sounds tragically sincere. I know five 
or six Bonzos who were recruited 
here, none of whom were accepted, 
and all of whom received "paid 
visits." Penn's football uprising is 
partially due to three of these Bonzos. 
Recruiting and success are self-
perpetuating. Carro can look better 
than Columbia's or Princeton's coach 
simply because of his record. A good 
year on the field means a good year 
recruiting, which means another good 
year on the field. Princeton's and 
Cornell's women's teams succeed on 
the same prin<(ipal. Yale, by post-
World 'War II standards, still has 
football facilities which would do 
justice to any nationally ranked 
university, while the basketball facili-
ties are not worthy of a serious high 
school program. And the women's 
facilities seem to be basic men'!! 
facilities after a poorly executed sex-
change operation. How can the 
women's coach leave her recruits 
drooling the way Carm left Bonzo? 
She can't, but women's sports are 
gaining a closer look from alums. 
Athletic recruiting can only be seen 
as a necessary evil or good. Yale's 
tradition, image and financial wen-
being depend on a "representative" 
student body which is superior to the 
"representative" student bodies of 
other colleges and universities, fist-
shaking idealists included. Paul 
Newman didn't become a star because 
he had a lisp and knew Hegel inside-
out. 

For the time being, Carm can rest 
easy while the other coaches kiss 
alums and give away cigars to get the 
won-lost percentages in the black. 
And the Bonzos and Ringos, as well 
as the Bonzettes and Ringorinas, will 
be accepted and rejected like everyone 
else, though the Bonzos may have an 
advantage. Even if John Pagliaro 
stares aimlessly a lot, he added some-
thing to this place. So, as a close 
associate of mine once told me, "Shut 
up, Snee." Remember, without creeps 
like me you'd have to bitch at 
inanimate objects.


**Question I**

Question I 
When a bolt 
strikes 
and cuts with its 
voltsÂ· 
coring 
the carcass 
left to rot 
and shrivel in its smallness, 
the charged air 
steals a spirit before it dissipates and settles, 
suffocate cry, 
under the rumble.
