Wednesday, March 15. Another 
get-to-know-your-Sputternick day, all 
fifteen hours worth from Wilmington 
to Winter Park, Florida. Certain 
things become evident to me. Those 
hustlers up at the front of the bus 
don't play simply because they want 
to crack the starting line-up. They dO' 
it because they're all getting rich. At 
least that's what they say. Lowry, who 
wears Coach's jacket, is getting rich; 
Big Hags, who sleeps with Coach's 
pillow, is getting rich. Certainly M.D., 
who eats Coach's Big Mac, is getting 
rich. We all wonder who's not telling 
~ the truth. 

The ethos of the day is the southern 
smuggle. Every hour or so, Walter 
slides Sputternick off the road and 
slips her through the trees, down 
some dirt road. Each of the dirt roads 
looks identical to me; all have a 
strange looking tree, kind of like a 
hybrid cigar, jutting up every 
hundredth marking. Even stranger, 
there's a sign fixed to each -
"Welcome, Yale Baseball" -
above a 
mysterious logo: a Y pierced by what 
'looks like a baseball but is actually a 
cigar. Eventually, each one of these 
roads leads to a one-room shack, 
where we stop while Walter, the pilot, 
hops down from his cockpit and 
snaps for a few assistants to follow 
him. Soon some of the guys come 
back bearing armfuls of cigars. 

Mysteriously, O.B. opens up the 
luggage berth in Sputternick's mid-
belly and removes the bat bag. 
Squatting on the grass, the guys 
. ._. proceed to remove the plastic caps 
from the ends of all of the bats. I 
didn't even know they came off. 
Inside, they're entirely hollow. Walter 
instfucts his men to stuff the bats with 
cigars. They do so, re-cap the bats, 
return them to the case, and return 
the case to the luggage berth. Walter 
makes a final trip to the shack to 
settle financial matters and comes 
back to the bus, puffing blissfully on 
a Louisville Slugger. 

Thursday, March 16. Rollins 
College. Wind wafted palm trees, a 
campus constructed around a swim-
ming pool and dedicated to one 
purpose, the sun. Courses in water 
polo, water skiing, and pool strutting. 
We -
the men and Karen of Yale 
baseball -
make ourselves conspicu-
ous. We are the only people camped 
about the pool before 7:00 in the 
morning. We are also, with the 
exception of Third World, the only 
people who sport our native coloring: 
the Yale pale. By game time this 
condition is rectified, but with severe 
consequences. No one can budge a 
limb. We try to-cancel the game, but 
are denied our request. Instead we 
play under protest and sunscreen. 

The solaces of losing a game at 
Rollins College are many and sooth-
ing. Most involve fluids of some sort. 
At 9:00 Cricket, Moon Beamy, and I 
begin the evening's revels with a 
• skinny dip in the officially closed 
Rollins College swim pool. By 
4:00P.M. we are all fast asleep. 

Friday, March 17. Our last day at 
Rollins, so we strive to maximize ~he 
ray absorption and leave town with a 
good bronze. In a morning swim, 
underwater in the deep end, I notice 
a poster enclosed in glass, planted on 
the bottom of the pool. Unbelievably, 
it turns out to be an advertisement for 
a singing concert the next evening. 
The photo depicts a cadre of twenty, 
typically rude-looking long hairs, clad 
in bikinis and posed in V formation in 
front of Sterling Library. Deja vu? 
Sun stroke? Drowning and an after-
life? Not with that crowd. The twenty 
bikini-bottom bad boys turn out to be 
for real, none other than the Society 
of Orpheus and Bacchus, more 
generally known as the SOB's. Among 
the motley contingent there snickers 
my roommate. Immediately I re-
surface and begin to plot. The SOB's 
are to sing tomorrow, but Yale 
baseball is to leave tonight. I won't 
have a chance to dispose of my 
roommate myself, but I will have 
immunity once I arrange for someone 
else to dispose of him for me. I get 
hold of pen and paper and compose a 
one-line letter, "David, kiss me, you 
ghoul, now." Next I seal the letter in 
an envelope and scout about for 
suitable game. She must be blonde 
and the sheer weight of her mammary 
mass must make not only me, but my 
roommate, David, giddy and grateful. 
I find such a person, who identifies 
herself as Dolly. I say "Hello Dolly," 
and dissolve into my Carol Channing 
imitation. Dolly sits, resplendently 
and abundantly. She is nonplussed. 
How could she be more plussed? 
Finally, after I settle down, she 
consents to deliver the note. My only 
regret is that I cannot learn the results 
until I get back to school. Not to 
disappoint the reader, however, we 
shall leap forward in time and get the 
inside story a week in advance. Dolly, 
dolt that she is, lost the letter, went 
up to David in the middle of the show 
anyway, and was immediately 
snatched up by David, who was 
giddy, grateful, and quite ga'llant. 

Saturday, March 18. A short flash 
of the Sputternick brings us to Lake-
land, Florida, an eight lane strip of 
highway lined with palaces of plastic 
nre-cooking. Hamburger Row. 
Hardy's, Burger King, White Tower, 
Gino's, McDonald's, the Calhoun 
Cabaret. The American zip dream run 
amok. Paroxysms of hamburger 
phobia, until I remember -
today is 
an off day. 

The guys splinter in several direc-
tions, some the way of Disney, others 
the way of Tampa Bay, and still 
others the way of the motel swimming 
pool. I select this last route and sit 
chaise-lounged by the kiddy pool. 
I wiggle my toes in the shallow end. 
I think about Eli. 

I remember I'm supposed to pre-
pare something for our annual rookie 
talent show. Since I don't know how 
to yodel and find it repugnant to 
dress up in drag {unlike Cricket, 
Wheels and Baby Hags, who perfume 
and perform admirably as the "Point-
less Sisters"), I have to resort to my 
only talent, plagiarizing second-rate 
poetry. The result of my effort, 
"Kenzie at the Fungo," the long-
awaited sequel to "Casey at the Bat," 
is printed, in part, below: 

There were saddened hearts in 
Mud ville. 
For a week or even more 
There were muttered oaths and curses, 
Every fan in town was sore. 
"Just think," said Hags, "How good it 
looked with Kenzie at the bat 
And then to think he'd go and pull a 
bush league move like that." 
(Kenzie had whipped with the bases 
full.) 
The Elis are now in the last half of the 
ninth, down 3-2 to Harvard. Their 
numero-uno slugger, the mighty 
Kenzie, currently, as noted above, out 
of favor with the fans, is about to 
come to bat, with the tying run 
already on first. 

A dismal groan in chorus came 
A scowl lined Walter's face 
As Kenzie walked up, fungo in hand 
And slowly took his place. 
But fame is fleeting as the wind 
And glory fades away; 
There were no wild or wooly cheers, 
No glad acclaim that day. 

At this point, Kenzie works the Harvard 
pitcher to a 3-2 count, then ·takes a 
wicked rip at a fastball. The poem 
concludes: 

Oh, somewhere in this favored land 
Crimson clouds may hide the suo 
And Mo's harmonica sadly play 
And Beamy have no fun. 
And somewhere over rookies' lives 
There may hang a heavy pall, 
But Eli hearts are happy now, 
Cause Kenzie jacked the ball. 

Unfortunately, the delivery of this 
chef-d'oeuvre was frustrated when, 
later that night, the rookies decided to 
restrict their show to a one act 
dousing of Uncle Wiggly in the motel 
pool. 

Sunday, March 19. All I remember 
is some girl knocking on the door to 
my motel room. I let her in. 

Monday, March 20. Her name is 
Jasmine. The rest of the trip is lost in 
a swirl of color and sun-tanned limbs. 
Now, nearly a month later, I am in 
love, and needless to say. no longer 
playing Eli baseball. 

Jacked to the fence in center field 
In rapid whirling flight 
The sun grew dim, both spheres were 
trashed 
And then. both lost to sight. 
Five thousand Elis mid-terms forgot 
Five thousand threw a fit 
But no one ever. found the ball 
That mighty Kenzie hit.
