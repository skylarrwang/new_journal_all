Black Bodies 
for Malcolm and Janet Thompson 
"And oh," says one child, "look at it! 
Spoon-moon." It is only soundless, 
Intimate, perfect as a roof 
Of closeness itself; whether a 
Window on the unbearable 
Brilliance of elsewhere, other skies 
Behind our own, or a tilted 
Face thrust in our midst, or even 
The blank centre of our lone eye, 
._. It is too large to hang. But then 
See -
its wavering bit of edge 
Brings the memory of a dead 
World pictured suddenly, for it 
Gives itself away with movement. 
The children run about the yard. 
As the light dims and thickens, each 
Tick of awareness in daylight 
Clouds, freezes, hesitates even; 
They become bolder and blinder 
In their running. Withdrawn into 
The glory of their own skins (thought 
Shells around the soft, weighty hull 
Which is robbed of light: a body), 
They escape in night. They stamp, shout 
And pound sightlessly at dumb ground, 
Halting only when something like 
A great telescope, there outdoors, 
continued from page 7 
the trail and reload my M-16 and 
keep on running. The foot hurts like 
hell, but keep on running. Fire a few 
rounds back but they can't see me and 
I'm going west. Their movement is 
north-south. They'll leave me now. 
I'm getting near Z7 and my foot is 
bleeding like crazy. I better find a 
place to crash until daylight. White 
man looks the same as a gook in the 
infrared and the new sniper line is up 
here. I smell lifers. A few yards ahead 
is a bush. Head for it. Just going for 
it ... CRACK-ck-ck-ck-ck. M-16 fire 
and I'm on my back. Silence. Blood. 
No pain yet. Flashes were straight 
ahead of me thirty yards. Sniper fire. 
My legs ain't movin' when I tell :~m 
to and I can hear the trees. Faintly. 
"Monkey 3 reports lone troop in 
Rll by Z7 zone. No other activity. 
No artillery needed. Over and out." 
The M-16 still by my side and my 
apea 7 days a week 
11 
lights going out. Scope the trees. 
Starting to feel the pain now. Never 
feel the pain until a minute after. Set 
the nozzle on medium spread. Scope 
it again and watch the two little 
Christmas fairies move. Radio me 
dead . . . Aim . . . then shoot me, you 
welcher . . . lifer . . . Pull the trigger 
and hundreds of rounds eat the 
tree ... listen. Leaves, twigs and shit 
hitting the ground, then the biggest 
shit around ... 
Forget it now ... a real nice sexy 
woman is coming down a long fur-
lined hallway. Come on baby, I'm 
ready like a bride on wedding night. 
Nice sexy soft woman. Come on baby 
and bring your sister for Malone ... 
come on you fine thing ... I empty 
my gun, aimed into darkness.

Makes them remember, holds their moon. 
Then the children play warrior. 
In the midst of theatrical 
Death, when stones, grass, stars still hover 
In balance at her falling head, 
One little girl remembers the 
Image she saw; she sighs, wriggles 
With delight, and shocks the others, 
Who cry, "But you're dead!" for she 
Gives herself away with movement.
