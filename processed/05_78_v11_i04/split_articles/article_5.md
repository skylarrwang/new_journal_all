The Saybrook "Round Table," although a recent 
tradition, is ... well, formidable. In the general dining hall 
scheme of things, the Round Table carries a great deal of 
weight, about a ton, by recent estimate based on the 
number of bodies and their relative size. How Saybrook, 
and the Table in particular, has amassed so much ... 
presence, shall we say, is the subject of debate on evenings 
at dinner when the only other thing you can think of to talk 
about is how much work you have. One theory claims that 
the dining hall floor is lower at this point than at any other, 
and that the football team has collected there by sheer force 
of gravity. This would be difficult to prove, but it is 
certainly true that the Round Table is closest to the kitchen, 
and is so situated that no one can pass in or out of the 
dining hall unobserved by its denizens. It is also true that, 
when an alternative arrangement of the table was suggested 
to the dining hall manager, he demurred on the grounds 
that "The Round Table wouldn't like it." The Round Table 
is always spoken o'f in capital letters. The Round Table is 
impossible to ignore. Not that anyone would want to. Like 
a bouquet of Yale's biggest and bestest, the Round Table 
adorns each meal in Saybrook, the focal point of the dining 
room. A must for the home decorator, in five different 
colors. A certain quality of monumentality presides over 
Saybrook with the Round Table, a quality for which the 
college is justly renowned. Who else can boast the combined 
presences of Vito, Nubes, and Ziroccoco at breakfast, lunch 
and dinner? The Round Table is a legend in its own time 
which, like the phoenix, dies each May, only to reappear 
again in the fall with a few new faces but the same 
approximate poundage. The mysterious self-perpetuation of 
the Round Table is only one aspect of its myth, which will, 
we fervently hope, go down in Yale History like the old 
Brick Row.
