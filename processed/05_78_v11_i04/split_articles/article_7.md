probably understood this better than 
anybody else and expressed this 
process and these values in their 
buildings. 

a polemic paraphrase 
When you enter your o~k-paneled, 
carved-stone bedroom, or approach 
the altar of Sterling Library, or 
ascend the Kline Spaceport, or pene-
trate the jewelbox of the British Art 
Center, you are, whether you like it or 
not, defining your existence as a Yale 
Man: Race, sex and political beliefs 
have nothing to do with it. The stones 
and concrete of this little piece of the 
Ivy League care only about the way 
their imagery can transform you into 
a loyal son of Old Eli. The last three 
presidents of Yale and half-a-century 
worth of Yale architects all believed in 
the conscious or unconscious program 
shared by almost all Yale buildings 
built in this century. The campus of 
Yale University is an everlasting 
tribute to the power of architecture in 
helping to form Men or, as one 
graduate student defined it, to "the 
ability of a lot of money, very 
tastefully applied, to co-opt absolutely 
everybody." 

Although the bulk of the Yale 
undergraduate experience takes place 
in an environment created by ·one 
architect and several capitalists -
the 
Gothic of James Gamble Rogers, built 
with the money of Harkness, Sterling, 
Cross and several others in the 
twenties and thirties -
Rogers and 
his donors were already working in a 
fairly well-established framework. 
Architects since then have continued 
to refine their images in terms of that 
framework, which can only be defined 
as the Yale Tradition. 

. Yale's first buildings were unpre-
possessing structures that might have 
housed any large New England enter-
prise. Typified by the Old Brick Row, 
they were square blocks in the 
reserved Colonial and Federalist style. 
It wasn't till after the Civil War, when 
Yale started to be both a major force 
in the city of New Haven and a large 
institution with its own traditions and 
identity, that the Yale buildings, 
mainly on the Old Campus, started to 
become more identifiable. 

The first Post-Bellum impulse was 
to be proud and open. Osborne Hall, 
which stood on the corner of Chaoel 
and College Streets, reflected this · 
opturusm, opentng up to the city with 
wide steps and poly-chromatic stone 
facade, large arches bending around 
the comer. Other buildings, such as 
Farnam Hall and Durfee, exploded 
with neo-Gothic turrets and beauti-
fully carved stone. YalC was no longer 
a somber divinity school, and its 
architecture, spearheaded by the f'rrst 
architecture school in America, was as 
bold as the young men immortalized 
on the walls of Mory's and in the 
yellowing pages of old class records. 
They have a stem look, are well 
dressed, athletic and careless, and 
their environment matched this bold 
and colorful image. 

But the buildings, by their very 
nature as institutions. discinlined with 
'their tall walls, narrow and heavy 
moldings. They did so even more when 
the city of New Haven discovered 
exactly how carelessly self-confident 
these Yalies were feeling, and reacted 
against them in, among other inci-
dents, the famous riot of 1914. Yale, 
as an institution, started to close itself 
off from the city and became a 
bastion, a closed castle on the highest 
side of the Green, a protective and 
aggressive stronghold of New England 
capitalist values. 

~n the roaring twenties, Yale be-
came more democratic, more open to 
the bright and the rich of all levels of 
society, as its outlook and dimensions 
expanded. The money that fueled this 
expansion came from some who 
didn't belong to the old families, who 
were not dedicated to the preservation 
of the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant 
Capitalist way of life, but to the 
pursuit of wealth, period. However, 
they felt that Yale and all it repre-
sented was absolutely necessary. Yale 
made a young man of talent into a 
Henry Luce or a Cole Porter or a 
Harkness: a successful member of this 
country's elite. The Yale Man became 
a definable being, commemorated in 
American folklore, whose central 
attributes were success, power and 
creativity. 

Architecture was a pnme tool in th( 
acculturation which built this image. 
James Gamble Rogers (himself a Yale 
Man) and his network of donors 
For its expansion, Yale adopted the 
system which had successfully kept 
the self-perpetuating elite of Oxford 
and Cambridge going for several 
hundred years. Somewhere in Yale's 
voluminous archives, there allegedly 
exists a box of postcards and draw-
ings from which Rogers used to steal 
ideas -
often quite literally -
for his 
designs on the Yale campus. But 
Rogers' own adaptation of that 
Gothic language helped to define the 
Yale Man. 

The two most obvious features of 
Rogers' architecture here are the 
tower and the courtyard, and since his 
time they have become the most 
dominating themes in all Yale archi-
tecture. The courtyard derives directly 
from its English models, but here has 
a very special meaning. Its potential 
was perhaps suggested to Rogers by 
the success of the great sheltered 
courtyard of the Old Campus. Always 
set off of the axes of New Haven and 
controlled not by open colonnades or 
by entrances through large public 
spaces, but by comparatively small 
and threatening gates, it represents the 
private, introspective and elitist side 
of Yale. Magnificently scaled, these 
courtyards are controlled by several 
distinct landmarks: the dining hall, 
the entryway-passage and -axis, often 
including subsidiary courtyards or 
narrow paths between forbidding 
walls, and the wasteful space of the 
towers, great masses of stone given 
over wholly to the message of a proud 
university displaying its wealth and 
intellectual power, in contrast to the 
inner sanctum of the courtyard itself. 

The courtyards and the dining halls 
were and are the places where the Yale 
Man is celebrated and formed by social 
accultqration. 

Rogers was playing historic games 
with the language of his towers and 
the statues with which he filled them. 
They are the spires of a new church of 
knowledge, whose body, the dining 
hall, takes the place of the church in 
the original monastery model as the 
place of public gathering. (Battell 
Chapel is Yale's only surviving 
church, and it doesn't even have a 
spire.) In the basement of Beinecke, 
there is a series of drawings by 
Rogers' office of some of the walls of 
the Harkness complex (Branford and 
Saybrook Colleges) in which every 
stone is carefully rendered in its 
casual uneveness, and then numbered 
for exact duplication by the stone-
cutters. These walls and their open-
ings are meant to be complex in both 
·historic and architectural terms, gently 
revealing the tradition and the future 
available here. Nowhere else has such 
a beautiful marriage of private and 
institutional objectives taken place in 
the creation of space. 

On the outside, these colleges have 
reached a perfect understanding with 
New Haven. They do not loom over 
the street; in fact, they meet it with 
very humanly scaled walls. But they 
clearly define the character of Yale. 
On the outside they conform and tell 
New Haveners about their values; on 
the inside, the New Haven street axis 
is often shifted slightly and the world 
of the courtyard envelops the Yale 
Man like a womb. 

The architects bu'ilding along with 
and after Rogers all conformed to thi~ 
plan -
as Calhoun College and the 
Hall of Graduate Studies show. But 
Rogers was the master in this lan-
guage and his greatest work, the 
Sterling Memorial Library, is a monu-
rpent to all of these themes. Sterling is 
a religious paean to Alma Mater, Our 
Lady of the Circulation Desk who 
looms over the dispensing-place of 
knowledge, symbol of the spirit which 
built this place, which inhabits it and 
which will form all of the library's 
partakers into its devout followers. 
Ironically, rebel forces have pene-
trated this Sanctum Sanctorum of the 
Yale Man. in the left-hand comer of 
the mural, a carpenter holds up a 
hammer and a sickle to the Lady. 

After the second world war, when 
America ruled the world and Yale, 
Harvard and Princeton ruled 
America, a new university president 
set out to further expand Yale, self-
consciously using the architecture to 
convey the proper image. A. Whitney 
Griswold, a scion of the best Yale 
families immersed in both the realities 
and the tradition of Yale, thought of 
the university concretely as having 
"buildings as lessons," reflecting the 
philosophy of Thomas Jefferson. 

Jefferson thought that his campus for 
the University of Virginia would teach 
its students the new values of en-
lightened, humane rationality. 

Griswold believed that Yale's build-
ings should show the diversity, the 
unbounded possibilities of architec-
ture and, by implication, of Amencan 
society. As one member of the Archi-
tecture School said, in an article/ 
interview with Griswold: "The ad-
ministration views the architecture of 
the university as an integral part of 
the educational process .... It is 
understood that architecture is largely 
a matter of intangibles, and that cost, 
while it is ill'\portant, is not the most 
important consideration." 

These were heady days for Yale and 
Yale architecture. While the university 
expanded r~pidly, it began to strain 
the boundaries of its walls, bursting 
out in the late fifties and early sixties 
with a great flood of buildings: the 
new art gallery, Science Hill, includ-
ing the massive Kline complex, the 
Whale, the Art and Architecture 
building, CCL and the monstrosities 
plunked down at the medical school. 
It was university policy to attract the 
top architects of the country to do at 
least one building at Yale, creating a 
stellar display of whatever American 
architecture had to offer. Yale quickly 
became, and remains, one of the 
centers of architecture in the 
country -
every single 'name' archi-
tect having either graduated from 
here, taught here or built here, often 
all three. Overlooking the dazzling 
panorama of talent, in which each 
building supposedly represents a stvle 
absolutely and polemically inimical 
to !he structure next to it, one 
nevertheless feels that all of these 
buildings have done no more than 
{urther define the image of the Yale 
Man. 

There is a very obvious reason for 
this: the most architecturally influen-
tial man at Yale during Griswold's 
presidency was Yale graduate Eero 
Saarinen, of whom Griswold himself 
said: "[I] came to have a great feeling 
of confidence in his opinion. I used to 
have long conversations with him 
about Yale ... from then until his 
death, Lhe) became the most influen-
tial spirit and voice in our site 
planning ... and in our building 
program." One becomes conscious of 
that famous "old boy network" which 
partially controls everything from the 
people who teach at the Architecture 
School to the architects who get the 
big commissions here. As any good 
Yalie knows, it is who you know that 
counts, perhaps because it is easier to 
trust a commonality of values and 
outlook than the cold facts of a 
resume. 

Saarinen understood what Yale was 
all about and, in designing the two 
new colleges paid for by Paul Mellon, 
our present-day Harkness, he followed 
the Rogers System. Using his own 
historical reference, the Italian village 
of San Gimigiano, he built the same 
off-axis courtyards opening up from 
narrow paths of entry and focused on 
the great volumes of the dining hall 
and the towers. The complexity with 
which the walls recede and advance 
matches that of Rogers' accidental 
stone walls. Saarinen wanted these 
modern, poured-concrete colleges to 
parallel those of his great predecessor. 
He had stones fitted into the forms of 
the concrete, around which the pour.:. 
ing was done. Later, judging the 
finished walls not 'stony' enough, he 
had workmen chisel away at the 
concrete and place more stones in the 
already set wall. Saarinen preached 
sensitivity and controlled monumen-
tality, and he successfully created a 
beautiful new home for the Yale Man 
with those terms. 

In the over-confident years of "The 
Best and the Brightest," when 
America was over-reaching itself in 
Vietnam, Yale over-reached itself on 
Beinecke Plaza. Dedicated to that 
arcanest aspect of Yale, the careful 
preservation of endless tomes of rusty 
knowledge, this scaleless wonder was 
originally conceived of, according to 
local folklore, in green onyx. When 
the architects, representatives of 
America's favorit~ corporate archi-
tectural firm Skidmore, Owings and 
Merrill, discovered that there was not 
enough commercially available onyx 
in the world to build this monster, 
they chose translucent marble; it is 
still, according to rumor, the most 
expensive building per square foot 
ever built. (These last facts cannot be 
verified because of Yale's secrecy in 
such matters.) At the same time, 
Beinecke broke all of the traditions, 
destroying a. courtyard, conforming to 
the axis of the streets and to a single 
scale. Like the average Yalie in the 
corporate world, it is hard, inhuman 
and yet magnificently cogent on the 
outside, meticulously detailed, 
luminous and elegant on the inside. 

Other disasters befell Yale: Becton, 
Helen Hadley Hall, and the new 
D.U.H. building sent such defenders 
of the sensitive Yale tradition as 
Vincent Scully howling in outrage. 
Another debacle, somewhat later in 
date, was Cross Campus Library, 
given over to Edward Larrabee 
Barnes, the favorite architect of the 
next president of Yale. Though it 
managed to surrender to the great 
Yale tradition, it is a badly designed 
building which gives in to that tradi-
tion without adding any creative 
elaboration of its own. 

By the time of President Kingman 
Brewster, Yale had come up with a 
grand plan for its further develop-
ment. This plan, unveiled in January 
of 1965, called for the expenditure of 
no less than $100 million for the 
construction of what amounted to a 
completely new campus. Cross 
Campus was to be extended across 
College Street, breaking through the 
New Haven street plan once more, 
and the whole block from there down 
to Temple Street was to house a 
massive set of social science buildings. 
Becton had already been planned. 
·Kline Science Center was the second 
of the projects, together with the new 
math building, transforming Science 
Hill into a monolithic monument to 
the computer, the test tube and the 
slide rule. The third project called for 
the massive expansion of the facilities 
at the medical school. 

Obviously and, some would say, 
luckily, this plan was never fully 
carried out. Yale realized, in the late 
sixties, its limitations. Its own stu-
dents, the city of New Haven and the 
demographics and economics of 
America each revolted against the 
transformation of the creative Yale 
Man, housed in a humanistically 
scaled cainpus devoted to the humani-
ties, into a technological master of 
computers. For the first time in a 
century, Yale had to rework its role in 
maintaining the creative elite: the 
failure of "the best and the brightest" 
and the failure of some of the new 
buildings at Yale can be seen as · 
parallel processes. 

The students and some of the 
faculty openly rebelled against the 
Yale image at this point. In the dead 
of night they erected Claes Olden-
burg's great Lipstick, a self-
proclaimed comment on our capitalist 
society, in Beinecke Plaza. Oldenburg 
had predicted that a placing of one of 
his works on the Yale Campus (he, 
too, studied here) would signal the 
coming of the revolution. Unfortu-
nately, this time the power of the 
image failed, although as a platform 
the lipstick became an integral part of 
the May Day riots. 

Only one building managed the 
intrusion of the sciences into the 
hearts and the curriculum of the Yale 
Man, precisely because it worked 
within the architectural language 
already set up by Yale. Philip 
· J ohnso.n, himself a vital link in 
various good old boy networks, en-
visioned the Kline Science Center as a 
bold tower, slightly but very confi-
dently off-axis, built from materials 
meant to blend with the rest of • he 
campus, enclosing a courtyard. But 
this courtyard is a sterile, wind-swept 
spaceport where all social focus is 
;nissing, perhaps because t~e whole 
complex of buildings was never 
completed. 

The Art and Architecture Building, 
designed by Paul Rudolph, was the 
other major building of the sixties, 
and the capstone of this architect's 
extensive involvement with New 
Haven and Yale, which included a 
deanship at the School and numerous 
civic and Yale buildings. Striking a 
tower's pose and creating only court-
yard spaces on the inside, it is an 
extremely compact statement and a 
part of the bastion motif: its walls are 
rough, its structure forbidding and 
domineering, its sheer play of forms 
an academic game with its own 
history (Frank Lloyd Wright, for 
one). These walls were formed, at 
grea.t expense, by attaching triangular 
pieces of metal inside the forms which 
mold the concrete and (here rumor 
starts), once the forms were taken off. 
having two hundred workmen pQund 
the not yet set concrete with jack-
hammers to achieve the proper degree 
of roughness.

aggressive view of Yale building in the
