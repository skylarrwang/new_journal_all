EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
the jungle silence is broken by the 
sound of my shit hitting the ground 
from up here. Not real busy in the 
middle of the hot afternoon so I keep 
crapping and radio Malone at the 
next position to let him know he owes 
me fifty big ones on the Ohio State-
._ Michigan game. I squat up in the tree. 
"Come in, Monkey 3, this is Monkey 
4. You owe me fifty bucks, Malone." 
Monkeys do it this way and so do I. 
"Roger, Monkey 4, this ii Monkey 
3, Skremsky speaking. Malone says 
you're lyin'. He hasn't head any score 
yet." 
"This is Monkey 4 and you tell 
Malone to quit smoking that mind-
killin' weed and that he owes me fifty 
clams." "I heard it on my little 
transistor radio. Tell him to catch the 
six o'clock Radio Saigon Sports 
Show." 

I wipe my ass and wait for a reply. 
They gave me a plastic bag so no one 
could smell me up here, but those 
gooks can smell a white man a 
hundred yards away and they don't 
need to smell his shit to know he's 
there. I dump it out of this little 
treetop bungalow so I can't smell it. 
" Monkey 3 to Monkey 4. That's a 
negative. It's against orders to have 
.,. any non-Army equipment in sniper 
nests. Over ... Malone's voice. 
··You damn, welching lifer, Malone, 
I'll transmit it to you then. That'll be 
flfty bucks on Wednesday. Over and 
out ... Malone'd pimp his mother to 
avoid paying off a bet. An RA, royal 
asshole or regular army, lifer, in for 
. life or till he dies, whichever comes 
first. Enlisted, not drafted ass. Christ, 
it still smells up here, and no matter 
what I do I can smell it. 

Even so, it's an amazing set-up, up 
here. I get a two week supply of food, 
a radio for transmitting troop move-
ments to artillery, a first-aid kit, 
water, and it's all laid out on top of a 
big net which is home for two weeks. 
Sniper Nest. Almost invisible from the 
ground too, but even so I better bit 
any gook that gets close enough to 
smell me or I'm a treed 'coon with a 
hundred little yellow dogs on my tail. 
It'd be pretty hard for that to happen. 
There's a whole line of sniper nests 
1 here. Huh, I got stuck next to 
Malone. 

Nothing to fJie at so I clean my 
weapon. It's quiet now. Amazing 
weapon, the M-16, capable of firing 
two hundred rounds in a few seconds, 
ten .. bullets" in each shot, like a 
cannon full of nails. You can control 
the bullets like water with a garden 
hose. Real wide spray for short range, 
real narrow for long range. I use long 
range. My targets usually show up 
two hundred yards in front of me on 
the Big Trail, and the poor suckers 
never know what hit 'em. I never 
miss, and seeing as how I can get off 
ten rounds in a wink ifs just a sealed 
package when I pull the trigger. 

Getting a little darker now, almost 
six,' and I transmit my Korean 
transistor to Malone to remind him 
that even though be outranks me a 
notch, be still owes me. The sound of 
the score confirms my kill on his 
money. 

So I sit up here smoking cigarettes 
and listening to Radio Saigon. Maybe 
take another shit, who knows? Right 
;on the DMZ and the big trail looking 
:for the little fellas to walk down the 
·thirty foot section that I can make out 
clearly. Thirty feet ain't that much, 
but soon as I see a gook prancing 
along I just take the old M -16 and 
put the lights out on him, hear the 
rest hit the dirt. I radio artillery and 
it's just a matter of the pansies 
shelling the daylights out of 'em. 
Works pretty good, too. I've had the 
little devils shelled fifteen times in the 
last three days. Hasn't been that busy 
since the New Year's fJieworks last 
year. Gooks must be moving in. 

Two more days for me until they 
send up ·another group of snipers for 
this line. Two men to a tree. I'm 
alone, though, because my partner got 
nailed four days ago. Fragments from 
a stray U.S. shell. They're a lot more 
dangerous than the gooks. I had to 
dump him out of the tree too, and 
when there's no wind I can smell him 
dead down there. No replacement for 
him. Didn't want to give away the 
pos1tion with the heavy VC activity 
and all. Eighty yards each side of me 
are teams doing the same job as me, 
but I hear me shooting a lot more 
than I hear them shooting. North of 
me there's my sector leader, RA, 
dopehead and welcher all in one -
Malone, and Skremsky. They rarely 
shoot anything and when I hear their 
shots I keep my eyes wide open 
because whatever they missed will 
show up in my sector, sometimes 
wounded, and I doubt if they've ever 
had a clea:t kill. Not like me. I kill -
now. The guys South of me are 
connected to a different artiiiery 
group so I don't have much to do 
with them and besides, I have the 
gooks on their asses before they get 
that far down the trail. I'm a damn 
good sniper. 

Now in sniper training the first 
thing they tell you is Don't Smoke. 
Group leader emphasized the fact that 
smoke coming from a tree is a dead 
giveaway of a sniper position. Tough 
beans, lifer. The second rule is No 
Radio Contact, except for artillery or 
first aid. The static of a radio's sound 
carries like a .. son of a bitch," he told 
us. That's life, lifer. I'd go loony 
without Radio Saigon, bad as it is, up 
here with me. Right now I can hear 
The Cowsills singing some stuff about 
long hair, which I used to have. 
Maybe next I'll bear Bing Crosby. 
Just as good as that Crosby, Nash, 
Stills junk. I don't need big musical 
experiences, just noise. The silence 
can drive you batty. It'd be nice to get 
out of here soon. I ate all the decent 
food they gave us like Hershey bars 
and peanuts and about the only thing 
left that I can stomach is powdered 
milk and some nasty beef jerky. I get 
more money for working in this 
penthouse. 

It's completely dark now and I have 
to use the infrared scope to see much 
of anything. A human body looks like 
a little red outline in the infrared 
scope. Cute little outlines too. No 
such thing as darkness for the infrared 
scope. Last night was pretty quiet, 
only five targets spotted. Five kills. 
Well, I'm going to catch a few hours 
sleep. I'll fire a few rounds in the 
vicinity of the trail and have artillery 
send a few big boomers over that 
way. I'll try and get the potheads to 
cover my section and keep me 
informed if anything serious comes 
up, while I'm sleeping. Then I'll grab 
some powdered milk and go back to 
work. I hope my ex-partner's smell 
isn't too bad tonight. I'm getting sick 
of smelling a corpse. I sleep. 

Mostly I dream of other things 
when I sleep up here. No army 
uniforms, no slant-eyes. Just women, 
sexy, soft women inside warm rooms 
with fur-lined walls. Come on baby, 
love those fur-lined walls, and just 
check out the beautiful women I see 
in my sleep. Busty blondes, leggy 
redheads, brown-eyed Italian 
brunettes. Just a few hours of 
beauty . . . 

I know it's going to be pitch black 
out when I wake up, but I make sure 
my mind knows what I'm going to see 
before I open my eyes. The darkness 
changes nothing I see in daylight. I 
have the infrared. I'm convincing 
myself that what I'm about to see is 
real because if I don't I'll be grouchy 
all day, or night, as the case may be. 
Tonight in the black I bear gunfire 
before I'm ready to open my eyes, 
making me have to open them and 
know I'm going to be grumpy. It's 
coming from a couple hundred yards 
south of me. Odd, I should have 
heard something on the radio. The 
gooks never get that far down the 
trail. I'm confused. Better wake up. 

Gunfire waking me up makes my 
stomach want to scoot out my butt. 
Maybe I'm dreaming, but there's 
usually a notable absence of gunfire in 
dreams about naked women. Still, I 
feel- safe due to experience. I call the 
nest north .of me ... no answer. 
Scope my section of the trail and the 
whole scope lights up red like a 
Christmas tree. Heavy, heavy move-
ment. I radio artillery. No need for 
me to fire at that many gooks, let the 
big boys do it. 

.. Monkey 4 calling for heavy artil-
lery barrage at coordinates R 15 by 
Z3." I try and be quiet. "Come in, 
Peashooter?" 

.. Negative Monkey 4 . . . uh ... 
You still up there?" 

.. No, I'm in Cleveland. I need heavy 
barrage now, Peashooter." 

"Ub, artillery is mobile in a west-
ward direction. No possibility of fiiing 
barrage at those coordinates ... Ub, 
retreat was ordered two hours ago ... 
urn ... Monkey 3 said you was dead 
when we radioed them. VC offensive 
moving in ..... 

.. Retreat?" Shit. ''Could you give 
me some mortar fire?" 

..Negative, Monkey 4, out of range. 
Get out of there. New sniper line is 
being set up at Z7 line with artillery 
support. Retreat at once." 

.. Send me a chopper with rockets, 
Peashooter." 

.. Roger, Monkey 4. Will call air-
borne. Over and out ... Good luck." 

Oh Jesus. Malone. I light a 
cigarette and immediately bear distant 
voices and a few leaves ripping with 
pellets zipping through the trees. 
Some gook must have seen the match 
light, but be's lost me now. Gooks 
must still be pretty far away. Minutes 
go by and I hum a little tune and 
think. No chopper pilot's going to fly 
into this at night, he'd be a sitting 
duck, and a rea.l noisy one. If be came 
he'd have to blow up the whole area, 
including me, just to get close enough 
to drop me a chair, if he could see 
me. Shit. Hell no, I'm getting out. 
Malone and Skremsky, kiss your asses 
goodbye. Now for business. 

Z7 is four miles due west. Trail 
number two beads that way. Booby 
traps on the trail. In the dark yet. 
Maybe Malone got a bamboo stick up 
his nose. Better scope the entire area. 
Big trail's running with the suckers. 
More than a hundred. No use 
shooting that mob. A few shots 
coming in my direction now and then. 
They can smell me. I know it. Scope 
the northern end. Damn near thick as 
grass a hundred yards up there. The 
gooks are moving heavy, real heavy. 
The southern end. Lots of them, but 
the whole concentration is over a 
hundred yards east of my position. 
Cover everything from there to here 
with the scope. Picks up any body 
heat. Ab, five little outlines flfty yards 
north and moving this way. Got to 
freeze 'em. I nail three of them with a 
burst of flfty rounds. Now the rest of 
the gooks are shooting at my area. 
Lots of stuff getting ripped up in the 
trees. Gooks ain't got infrared. But I 
hear the zips getting closer now. I 
better get out. I put the rope out of 
the nest, turn up my transistor radio. 
Hope the gooks still think I'm up 
here. It'll at least make the sound of 
me less obvious. 

Halfway down my foot gets zipped 
and it's numb. Now it's starting to 
hurt, but I'm down. I empty a few 
hundred rounds aU over the place and 
pop a flare up into my old nest. Tree 
lights up. They shoot about a million 
7 
rounds at it and I make tracks down
