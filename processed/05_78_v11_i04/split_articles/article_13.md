was scheduled for undergraduate 
shows this year because no time was 
left on the schedule. It does not feel 
good to be forgotten. Students who 
feel the need to exhibit their work 
have taken the initiative themselves. 
Some students are attempting to 
secure a new permanent undergrad-
uate ~;a llery space, while others have 
worked to organize shows inde-
pendently of the art school, for 
example, the recent show of under-
graduate women's art at the Women's 
Caucus in Hendrie Hall. There have 
been three open houses organized by 
students. The students' unified efforts 
call attention to the lack of effort the 
administration puts into integrating 
the undergraduates into art school 
and Yale activities. 

This lack of interest implies a lack 
of respect for undergraduates. One of 
my art teachers calls us "kids." I am 
not a fanatic over vocabulary, but I 
do not like the tone of "kids," which 
implies a popsicle-box producing arts 
and crafts shop instead of a studio. I 
call attention to this because the belief 
that "undergraduates are not serious" 
is manifested in a variety of ways. The 
painting studios are "not conducive to 
serious painting," as one student put 
it. Two studios are in the basement of 
the building with no windows, poor 
ventilation, overcrowding (as many 
people know, art classes are often 
overcrowded, and it is almost impos-
sible for a non-art major to get into 
most of them) and lights which seem 
better suited to growing Spider plants 
than painting. The advanced studio 
on Chapel Street is only slightly 
better. Students speak positively of 
the Hammond Hall sculpture space 
and the photography facilities, but 
again all students complain of the 
lack of show space. 

Uther comments on the art depart-
ment: 
"Studious, pressured, academic, sort 
of stifled, not overly creative in 
outlook ... in general I think there is 
too much verbal self-justification, 
putting one's work in historical con-
text." 
"I think we're encouraged to paint 
pretty 'acceptable' pictures and not to 
eXplore the world through paint." 
"The more art courses I take, the 
more I enjoy them and get something 
out of them, regardless of teaching 
quality ... " 

Almost all art students would agree 
that the graduate students are a very 
positive part of the art school. I have 
had some truly excellent and con-
cerned T.A.'s. The art school's guests 
are first-class, and the lectures and 
critiques given by visitors and faculty 
are nearly always worth attending. 

I expect that my own need to make 
and build things out of what I see in 
the world will be with me long after I 
leave Yale. If it is, if I am truly filled 
with ideas of art (that may mean 
colors, sounds, concepts), I will have 
no qualms about calling myself an 
artists. I am not sure I will ever know 
whether I am "good" or not, and it is 
not a major question for me now. As 
one student said, "The people I 
respect, respect me and my work and 
in the long run that's all that 
matters."

**Mona Hanna**
**Author: Robert R. Roman**

Mona Hanna 
The Yale University Art Galkry 
recently announced the auction and 
sale of a veritable masterpiece, 
virtually unknown in art circles, 
entitled "Hanna from Heaven." (Fig. 
l) She has been purchased by the 
University of Chicago for six million 
dollars. Little art-historical criticism 
has been published about the work, 
and the artist is unknown, although, 
judging from stylistic and compo-
sitional characteristics, the photog-
rapher plays off a well-developed 
theme: "Hanna" is a direct descendant 
of Leonardo da Vinci's "La Joconde" 
("Mona Lisa"), dating 1503-1505 (Fig. 
2). 

Leonardo's masterpiece is best 
known for the enigmatic expression 
on Mona Lisa's face. She sits com-
fortably, her gaze directed toward the 
onlooker, breaking through the two-
dimensional painted surface of the 
canvas to establish a mysterious 
rapport with the viewer. In this 
respect, "Hanna from Heaven" (or, 
the "Mona Hanna," as it is more 
commonly known) differs from its 
predecessor: the smile has widened, 
yielding a perplexed look; her eyes 
peer heavenward, requesting divine 
intervention (but not non-binding 
arbitration). 

Mona Hanna feels threatened by 
some unknown force and reacts by 
crossing her arms protectively. Note 
the more warm, welcoming hands of 
the earlier Mona Lisa: the caressing 
hands convey a maternal gentleness 
which Mona Hanna lacks, her hands 
hidden securely away; one might 
never shake hands with this tight-
fisted woman. In contrast to the 
motherly Mona Lisa, Mona Hanna is 
no Mother Yale. 

That "Hanna from Heaven" is 
closely related to "La Joconde" is 
unquestionable, but other copies and 
alterations of the Mona Lisa have 
been created over the years. The Dada 
movement of the post-World War I 
era ,_qoasts the Marcel Duchamp 
"ready-made assisted version" of the 
Leonardo masterpiece. Duchamp 
added mustache and beard to the 
Mona Lisa, entitling the work 
"LHOOQ," a crude French play on 
words. "Hanna from Heaven" is also 
subject to violation by a modem 
artist -
with mustache and beard, 
Mona Hanna would be labeled 
"LHOOQ2- ("Elle a chaud aux 
coudes"), translated loosely as "She's 
got bot elbows." Perhaps the un-
known photographer foresaw this 
future addition and seated his subject 
with her arms in this conspicuous 
pose. 

"La Joconde" was the inspiration 
behind "Hanna from Heaven," yet the 
great Leonardo masterpiece itself 
evolved from an even earlier work, 
the Archaic Greek Auxerre kore, c. 
650B.C. (Fig. 3). The female figure 
displays a similar, albeit Archaic, grin, 
despite severe damage to a major 
portion of the face. The statue itself 
expresses a monumental stoicism 
which is repeated by Leonardo, but 
somehow lacking in "Hanna from 
Heaven." Most important, however, is 
the statue's arm; it crosses obliquely 
in front of the figure, a motif which 
Leonardo continued and developed, 
including both arms in a tnJly gentle 
configuration. In the modern compo-
sition, Mona Hanna crosses her arms 
more st. r'ly, in reaction to the 
,. 
threatening forces of American 
society. Note how the centuries 
separating the Mona Hanna from the 
kore have de-emphasized the idealized 
schema of the maiden, yielding a 
more naturalistic depiction of 
twentieth-century woman. 

The evolution from kore to Mona 
Lisa to Mona Hanna is remarkable, 
transcending the differing media; 
"Hanna from Heaven" constitutes the 
culmination of this stylistic trend. 
Thucydides said that history repeats 
itself; this is true for the history of 
fine arts as well. A group of statues 
now in the University of Chicago 
Museum, dating as early as 2700B.C., 
resemble Hanna in the motif of 
crossed arms (Fig. 4). Or could this be 
an ancient representation of a Yale 
Corporation meeting? 

In purchasing Mona Hanna, the 
University of Chicago adds a truly 
exceptional objet d'art to its col-
lection. However, Chicago has ob-
viously recognized the importance of 
Mona Hanna; it is attempting to 
acquire a work from each phase .in the 
evolution of strategic arm location.

**Yale Architecture and its Contradictions**

continued from page 1 2 
part of that very meaning is the fact 
that, in our democracy, the powerful 
elite must hide its power utterly in the 
fabric of society. Though Yale's 
buildings must be an aggressive 
bastion, they may not be too visible 
to the village below. 

One person who feels he can work 
out all of these difficulties is the 
university's consulting architect, Herb 
Newman. To him, Yale is a world 
unto itself, scaled for the pedestrian 
Yale Person, a treasury of great 
architecture and of ideals, one that he 
will work very hard to preserve. 
"Yale," he told me, "and Yale 
architecture have a knitting kind of 
quality, they form a network of ideas. 
That's what the Old Boy Network is 
all about: it's about human relations, 
putting the person in the center, and 
it's about the pursuit of excellence. 
The network has gone beyond being 
WASP; it includes people like 
Giamatti, and me, a Jew from the 
neighborhood here .... It's about the 
preservation of a humanistic tradition 
of values, a kind of elitist making you 
aware of the fundamental value of 
architecture, the fundamental issues at 
the heart of education. The architec-
ture doesn't deal so much with 
specific people like Griswold or 
Brewster; the architecture here is self-
perpetuating, we are only trustees." 

Since Yale has been successful in 
creating such a cogent, ever-changing 
model for the Yale Man, the fmal 
question is what we as trustees want 
to do with that model, and bow we 
are to deal with the inner contradic-
tions which not only give it elegance 
but might, in the end, destroy it.
