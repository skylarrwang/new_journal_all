Many people question the credi-
bility of Yale's admission policy 
towards athletes. Like all issues that 
appear to have a loose end somewhere 
(the Warren Commission, for ex-
ample, or whether Farrah is really a 
lesbian), Yale's recruiting policy 
invites skepticism. Ever since I saw 
John Pagliaro taking notes with 
crayons, I've had my own doubts. 
Having proven myself a poor 
investment on the football office's 
balance books -
I was a hopelessly 
undernourished, overconfident passing 
quarterback, a gazelle in a herd of 
buffalo, as I like to think of it -
can still imagine people looking at me 
with the same skepticism. And I am 
basically familiar with the processes 
which bring the objects of this · 
::kepticism to Yale. 

The NCAA and Ivy League recruit-
ing guidelines, which are changed 
more often than my underwear, rule 
the procedure. The Ivy League, 
because of its ideal philosophy of 
intercourse between athletics· and aca-
demics, offers no scholarships. 
("Ideal," as far as I can tell, means 
athletics should be forced into a 
meaningful love affair with academia, 
instead of a casual erotic affiliation.) 
Through the graces of the NCAA, 
Yale nevertheless competes for 
athletes with reichs like Michigan, 
USC and Notre Dame. Any athlete 
on financial aid in the Ivies is 
considered in the same light as 
someone at a Big Ten School on a 
"full-ride," which is legally defined as 
tuition, room and board, period. Each 
school is limited to a total of 105 
scholarships for all sports, though 
only varsity athletes count. (How 
Carro must have twitched with delight 
when my name went off the roster.) 

The alums foot most of the bill for 
this operation, and Yale's recruiting 
dollars come directly from Old Blues 
all over this great country of ours. 
Tigers and Cantabs do the same for 
their Alma Maters. And while Ray 
Carazo and Carro enjoy a bottle of 
wine somewhere, Old Blues scour the 
sports pages looking for talented 
young studs and studettes with good 
grades. A major conference school 
like Michigan has an astronomical 
number of dedicated alums, and 
regional loyalties are involved. 

Carro and Ray get the scoop from 
the alums and, in the words of a 
Times Square vendor, "check it out." 
The impressior.able youths in question 
are then inunJated with form letters, 
phone calls and good advice: if you 
don't go to Yale, you'll be a ditch-
digging Cleveland State dropout. The 
various football coaches get the 
proper information and then it's their 
ball. 

Like sailors in a brothel on payday, 
the coaches actively pursue the 
available talent and meet the recruits 
in one-horse towns everywhere, if 
possible. They assess all the available 
facts, watch movies, talk with coaches 
about the recruit's attitude and poten-
tial: my own high school coach was a 
convicted con man. Some sports, such 
as gymanstics, fencing and women's 
as gymnastics, fencing and wome~'s 
softball recruit via phone and mat! for 
the most part. simply because of lack 
of funds. Translated, that means lack 
of alumni interest, which may be due 
to lack of success on the playing field, 
or may simply reflect overall attitudes 
towards sports which are less extr~va­
gant in terms of spectator populanty. 
(Quick: who was the captam of the 
fencing team the same year John 
Smoot was the football captain?) 

Enter once again the NCAA. The 
impressionable youths will want to see 
the holy temple of higher education 
they've been hearing so much about, 
but there are strings attached. Sup-
posing Jimmy (Bonzo) Quarnucci; all-
Ohio, brick-eating fullback with 800 
SATs wants to see Yale? You can bet 
your mother's padded bra that Carro 
will invite him up. Carro calls Nathan 
Sterney Whitling Osborne the fifti.eth, 
rich Old Blue, and sings Bonzo's 
praises. Bonzo receives a plane ticket 
to Hartford, gets a ride to Yale, stares 
at his first Gothic building and, open-
mouthed and drooling, shakes hands 
with Carro. He eats lunch with "real, 
live college football players!" and gets 
drunk for the next two days. Needless 
to say, he goes back to Waponetka 
highly impressed. This is what is 
known by the NCAA as a "paid 
visit": the recruit receives food, lodg-
ing and/or transportation a Ia Uni-
versity, which in Yale's case means the 
alums. Bonzo was sponsored by 
Osborne. 

Now, supposing Ringo Slowrunner, 
a lackluster place-kick holder from 
New Rochelle, wants to visit. In spite 
of his acne and crooked eyes, Carro 
will invite him up. "Ringo," he'd say, 
"Get in your father's Rambler and 
come on up." Ringo will drive up, get 
lost on Dixwell A venue, shake Carro's 
hand (maybe) and get a free lunch 
with an assistant coach who will yawn 
frequently. Then Ringo will drive 
·back home, also a highly impressed 
youth. This visit is known simply as a 
"visit," and Ringo can come back 
every day for a year to do the same, 
and as far as the NCAA is concerned, 
he hasn't had a "visit." Woody Hayes 
won't have Carro assassinated for 
feeding the likes of Ringo. "Paid 
visits" are for the blue-chippers. 

A university (Division I to the 
NCAA) is allowed to have 95 such 
youths come on "paid visits." These 
ninety-five are a select group who 
A) Probably qualify academically, 
B) Want to come here, C) Weigh 
about 250 pounds, D) Are favorites of 
the alums who want to "sponsor" 
their visits, E) Eat a lot of raw meat. 
And there is no way someone who 
hasn't already applied to Yale will get 
the Bonzo Quamucci treatment. 

Bonzo, or Ringo, or anyone else is 
allowed six of these paid visits to 
various schools, according to the 
NCAA, so he must also assess the 
situation. 

Now that the leg work is done, the 
Ringos and Bonzos sorted out, Carro 
and his boys (all the athletic depart-
ments' coaches) sit back and wait for 
Bonzo is a "highly diversified young man 
with many interests outside aca~emics" 
women, booze, tying his shoelaces. 
Worth David's crew at the Admis-
sions Office. Sort of. 

If you believe that Worth and the 
friendly folks at admissions haven't 
heard about Bonzo's talent, then 
you're an idealist who probably 
boycotts everything and eats wheat 
germ. For the record, there is a ~'very 
formal" liaison between Admissions 
and Ray Tomkins House. (Her name 
is Margot and I bet she's a looker.) It 
is her responsibility to find out from 
the various coaches who's a Bonzo 
and who's a Ringo, and she gets the 
word from Gib Holgate, Associate 
Director of Athletics, who gets his 
info from the horses' mouths, the 
coaches. Gib might tell Margot that 
Bonzo is "a highly diversified young 
man with many interests outside of 
athletics" -
women, booze, tying his 
shoelaces. Margot, not being a 
moron, will report to Worth that 
man who eats bricks and kills small 
animals for kicks." 

The whole mess is now in Worth's 
lap. Now, from my own experience as 
a recruit, I know that certain aspects 
of the admissions process are not as 
airtight as they seem on paper. For 
instance, I was allowed to send in my 
application on February 2, though the 
deadline plainly reads "January 1." I 
asked Mr. David about this, expecting 
him to break into a cold sweat and 
offer me a few C-notes not to let on. 
He sat back, smirked, and stated that 
the deadline was an ideal and that it 
might be extended for anyone. (A 
definite retroactive blow to my ego.) 
Idealist, strike two. When you were 
sweating it out over a Yale applica• 
tion while your family enjoyed 
Christmas dinner, you could have 
been munching wheat germ instead of 
developing ulcers. The deadline, as 
Mr. David puts it, is "to give us a 
reasonable amount of time to review 
all the applicants." It is not, alas, a 
life-and-death boundary. 

People like Bonzo, who kill small 
animals and eat bricks, are part of 
what Worth calls "a representative 
class, not 1300 statistics." He also says 
that "not everyone we admit is a 
potential Phi Beta Kappa." (The 
idealists shake bony fists at the idea.) 

Could Worth be avoiding the ques-
tion? When asked if the admissions 
office, i.e., W.D., had any thought in 
general on athletic recruits, Mr. David 
replied, cool as ever, that, "First of 
all, we don't admit anyone who isn't 
capable of doing the work at Yale. 
Secondly, we know that athletes have 
successfully demonstrated their energy 
and motivation and we know that this 
motivation may be adapted to fit into 
their Yale experience. We want to 
admit someone whose Yale experience 
will be fruitful even if athletics fade 
from the picture," for instance be-
cause of injury, or undernourishment 
and overconfidence. (I was beginning 
to like this guy.)
