Springtime really blooms here, but thighs and shins stay white long beyond that. A good friend who just graduated from Saybrook came to visit me at the May Ball last June (the 'May' is British misdirection) only to ask why no one played Frisbee in Cambridge. "A question I asked myself at first, too," I said to her.


Spring brings knifeblades of bulb-shoots onto the perimeters of smooth carpeted grass that keeps its green long into fall; she, like I, had been accustomed to seeing oil-basted bodies browning by Berkeley wall, to watching the Cross Campus lawn pulverized, replanted, and annihilated again by over-calloused feet. It did not matter which way the bodies were turned or entwined - they were all white bodies in a supine line-up: you saw only a swath of hair and a pair of Polaroid sunglass lenses with mock-Gucci frames.


"Why don't the English lie out in the sun here?" she asked; no one was in sight.


"Because they want to stay English," I answered.

Every cloud has a silver lining. English skies have mostly clouds.


"Didn't you know," advised my plump Tutor, in his stately, cold room at St. John's College, "that the secret to enjoying England as a country is learning to get the most out of its teas?"


"Its teas?"


"Precisely. Its teas."


Teas flowing in and out of every pore; weekly trips with other Americans on fellowships to London stores or hotels where tea is a ritual of much weight - Fortnum and Mason's, Brown's (where Faulkner always insisted on staying), Harrod's; big teas and little teas; with demerara and granulated sugar; black or white; one or two; strainers to keep tiny tea leaves out; sweet, medium-dry, dry sherries after; exotic Oriental teas, murky, despotic, opium-smoking Fu Manchu teas; teas steeping placidly in teacups and teapots of china teaware, adm ist saucers full of crumpets and scones, livening Britain's chilly circulations.


None of it drives the English clouds away or the English out of doors. "It sure was awful when we had that drought here, back in the summer of '76," I heard one British student say. "Nothing but sun, sun, and more sun. I'll be damned if I didn't get so brown I'd turned into a Paki." This is a culture of the indoor life: clouds and the dribbling grey rain on chilly windowpanes. No one dares to go out in the Springtime heat for fear that they will find what they have missed before, that their bones will thaw and they will feel a colder coldness come wintertime. Tea (like the Deutsche Bundesbahn in Germany) is still the only thing in England, except for the Greenwich Observatory, that you can definitely set your watch by. 4:30 is time for tea.




I am now lost to Cambridge. It is a sign of healthy adjustment. Last month, crossing the Cam in the Basil Rathbone fog, I realized that I have become invisible to Cambridge as Cambridge had been to me. Invisible, because I no longer make mistakes here. I have grown used to hearing otherwise normal people say: "I could sure use a fag tonight," meaning 'cigarette'; or "I'm pissed," meaning 'drunk'; or "I think I'll go knock up a girlfriend of mine tonight," meaning 'to visit'. It was invisible to me for so long ... Sir Kenneth Clark ... Propert's Saddle Soap . . . Harvey's Bristol Cream: a potpourri of stereotypes, unseen, unheard as such. Now I end every statement with an interrogative, consensus-producing "... isn't it?" Now I am not overtly curious about anything. Nothing exists outside of England, except Wales, Scotland, and, remotely, Ireland. The sun never sets here.


"You Americans at Cambridge have it easy," said a pipe-smoking, phlegmatic American friend of mine at Oxford, who had been a nice guy at Yale. I wanted to leave, but there was only the infrequent and unreliable bus to ferry me back across country over the Midlands to the Eastern fens, and I knew I could not get back to Cambridge (so invisible that I call it 'home') unless I waited for him to drive me. "You all only have to put up with the British. Sure, they're boring and talentless. But we here at Oxford have the Americans and Canadians, too. What could be bloody worse? One doesn't have a single English friend here. You might as well be going to Yale again, mightn't you? Every third jacket in Oxford is of down, isn't it? Every sixth foot is sitting in an L.L. Bean hunting shoe or topsider. You haven't as many Americans as us down in Cambridge, have you?" I would have answered "No, we haven't," but I realized that the cultural interrogative was only a British effect, and rhetorical questions should always remain unanswered.




Political wines here are very thin. There are five South Africans living with me in my hostel who tell me that blacks have ruined America, and they won't let that happen in S.A. in a million years. The new Master of King's College is a celebrated English Marxist. He is served nightly on High Table by staff waitresses and servants making a pound an hour garbed in dour black robes. Pass the snuffbox, won't you? Cambridge owns Cambridge lock, stock, and barrel. New Haven, you never had it so good.
