A
t her day job at Yale Dining, Shamica 
Frasier is who co-workers turn to with 
all birth-related questions. Pregnant 
co-workers consult with her on breastfeed­
ing, mood swings, and unexpected changes 
in their body. Other colleagues solicit health 
advice to pass on to their wives, grandmas, 
cousins, and friends.
Frasier loves these questions, no mat­
ter how random or intimate. Birth is 
her life's work. When she’s not at 
Franklin and Murray dining 
halls, Frasier is a doula, guid­
ing clients through a birth­
ing process often marred 
by confusion and fear. 
“Being a doula isn’t 
just you clock in one day 
and clock out,” Frasier says. 
“You’re always clocked in.” 
Since becoming a doula 
three years ago, Frasier has 
discovered that everyone has 
questions about childbirth—
especially Black families, who 
can receive inadequate hospital care 
and face grim maternal and infant health 
disparities.
Frasier, whose red glasses match the magen­
ta-streaked locs that tumble over her shoulders, 
developed an interest in health and anatomy as a 
young girl. She was a teenager when she became 
pregnant with her first child. The birth of her sec­
ond child a few years later was traumatic. 
After her second birth, Frasier began to won­
der: were other Black mothers experiencing simi­
larly harrowing births? What could she do to give 
other people a better experience?
Researching online, she came across the term 
“doula,” a companion who provides emotional and 
physical support to parents throughout pregnancy, 
birth, and the postpartum period. She learned 
how, for centuries, births in African American 
communities were attended by midwives and 
birth companions who drew from African heal­
ing traditions.
The idea of becoming a doula captivated 
Frasier. As a doula, she could directly support 
parents like herself without incurring massive 
student debt to become a highly-trained med­
ical professional. While both midwives and 
doulas focus on low-intervention, natural births, 
midwifery involves professionalized medical 
care. Certified nurse-midwives, the most highly 
trained type of midwife, must complete three 
degrees and pass a national certification test in 
order to practice. Doulas, in contrast, can become 
certified through a variety of different channels, 
including workshops, online training, and shad­
owing other doulas. 
Frasier signed up for training, became a cer­
tified breastfeeding counselor, and eventually 
opened her own New Haven-based business, 
New Birth Journey, in 2019. Since she began prac­
ticing three years ago, Frasier has helped fifteen 
clients through their pregnancies. 
“Being able to see moms overcome something 
that they fear…being able to usher them through 
a whole life changing experience—it’s been a love 
for me,” Frasier says. 
Doulas have risen in prominence over the 
past few years, with several studies linking 
doula care with higher rates of vagi­
nal births, a reduction in preterm 
births, and a lower likelihood of 
birth complications. Last sum­
mer, Connecticut Governor 
Ned Lamont signed S.B. 986, 
which will create a state cer­
tification process for doulas 
and provide Medicaid cov­
erage for doula care, among 
other provisions. Advocates 
argue that the state should 
invest in doulas to help keep 
parents and infants healthy as 
maternal mortality rates climb and 
access to maternal care narrows. 
The United States faces a mater­
nal health crisis. The number of pregnancy-re­
lated deaths in the United States doubled in 
the last twenty years. Over the same period 
of time, maternal mortality in other high-in­
come countries declined—even though the U.S. 
spends more per capita on healthcare. Black and 
Indigenous women experience the highest rates 
of pregnancy-related complications, with rates of 
pregnancy-related deaths for Black people three 
times higher than the rate for white people. 


As maternal mortality rates climb, people 
across the country face fewer options for where 
and how they can deliver their babies. More than 
one in ten U.S. counties have lost obstetrical units 
in the past five years. At least five Connecticut 
hospitals have terminated their maternity wards 
since 2010, many after being acquired 
by larger healthcare corporations. 
In New Haven, the closure of 
the Vidone Birth Center at 
Saint Raphael Hospital 
has narrowed options for 
people seeking low-in­
tervention, 
midwife­
ry-centered births. 
The financial push 
for hospital consoli­
dation and the closure 
of maternity wards has 
made 
it 
increasingly 
difficult for doulas and 
midwives to care for low-in­
come communities. Doulas 
like Frasier, intent on giving qual­
ity care to the people who need it most, 
find themselves working in a profit-driven system 
set up against them. 
Black and Indigenous women 
experience the highest rates of 
pregnancy-related complications, 
with rates of pregnancy-related 
deaths for Black people three 
times higher than the rate for 
white people.
More than one in ten U.S. 
counties have lost obstetrical 
units in the past five years. At 
least five Connecticut hospitals 
have terminated their maternity 
wards since 2010, many after 
being acquired by larger health­
care corporations.


Before giving birth, patients may only see 
their doctor and nurses a handful of times, if at 
all. Frasier prides herself on working with clients 
from the very beginning of pregnancy to well 
after the baby is born. While clients are preg­
nant, she teaches them different birthing posi­
tions and explains what to anticipate during the 
delivery. During labor, Frasier is by her client’s 
side, whether they’re delivering in the hospital 
or at home. After the pregnancy, she helps cli­
ents breastfeed, watches the newborn while the 
new parent rests, and even does loads of laundry. 
Frasier’s job, as she tells it, is to help her clients 
feel knowledgeable about their options, especially 
in the hospital.
“It’s giving them that confidence to be able 
to not walk out with their tail between their 
legs, but their head up and shoulders back 
like ‘Hey, I have an idea of what I’m talking 
about,’” Frasier says. She is keenly aware 
of how Black patients’ voices are often 
pushed to the margins in a hospital 
setting, and how the birthing pro­
cess can spin out of their control.
“There’s a cascade of inter­
ventions that often happen in 
hospital births that themselves 
can be harmful, can cause 
adverse outcomes—what we call 
birth trauma—and take away 
control from the patients,” Gina 
Novick, Associate Professor of 
Midwifery at the Yale School of 
Nursing, explains. 
While such interventions, includ­
ing C-sections and inductions, can be 
necessary to protect pregnant people and 
infants, unnecessary C-sections can have 
lethal consequences, including infections, 
blood clots, and hemorrhaging. C-section 
rates above 19 percent of live births have not been 
shown to improve maternal or infant health, but 
in Connecticut, 35 percent of births are C-sections. 
In 2021, the C-section rate for Black women in the 
United States was 19 percent higher than the rate for 
white women.
Jessica Westbrook, another New Haven-
based doula, views herself as an advocate for 
clients in the hospital setting. Like Frasier, 
Westbrook decided to become a doula after 
receiving poor hospital care, feeling isolated and 
abandoned after the birth of her first child. As a 
doula, she says that she notices discrepancies in 
the treatment her white and Black clients receive 
at the hospital—even with the same provider. 
“Sometimes they treat the women of color 
like they are just numbers,” Westbrook said. “It 
just seems very routine—there’s no sort of bed­
side manner that feels comfortable with them.” 
She’s observed an increased push for C-sections 
with her Black clients. 
Westbrook described working with a recent 
client, a Black woman pregnant with twins. 
Hospital staff wanted to put her on a steroid as 
part of “standard procedure.” After pressing pro­
viders on why the woman needed the steroid and 
what the possible side effects could be, hospital 
staff checked the patient’s file and saw that she 
was allergic to the steroid. Westbrook believes 
that if she hadn’t intervened, the woman could 
have lost her life. 
“Medicine is driven to look at people like 
a complication, like a disease,” says Lucinda 
Canty, a certified nurse-midwife and Associate 
Professor of Nursing 
at University of Massachusetts, Amherst. “When 
I was in the hospital setting, it was like a woman 
comes in—if she’s not really in labor, we’re going 
to send her home. If she doesn’t move fast enough, 
we’re going to have to give her Pitocin or medi­
cine to speed things up. If she’s still not moving 
fast enough we’ve got to start thinking about a 
Cesarean. Once she comes into the system, she’s 
already a problem.” 
Childbirth in the United States wasn’t 
always so medicalized. In 1900, half of all babies 
in the United States were delivered by midwives, 
who were mainly immigrants from Europe 
and Mexico, or Black women. Katy Dawley,
