Rolling hills. A long pasture of highway. 
Cars grazing in the distance. 
The view from the classroom at Danbury 
Correctional Facility could be idyllic enough for 
portraiture—if one leaves out the chain link fence. 
Jonathan Herrera Soto YSA ’23, a Teaching 
Fellow in the Yale School of Art’s Art and Social 
Justice Initiative, spent the slippery months of 
mid-summer driving up a jagged path to a small 
parking lot in western Connecticut.
Lugging art supplies from his trunk, Herrera 
Soto would enter the prison for a security screening reminiscent of the TSA’s. At times, guards 
turned materials away, forcing him to return 
crates of styrofoam back to his car and improvise 
lesson plans without them. 
 “I know I'm not supposed to bring in, like, 
hazardous contraband, but I don't really know 
what contraband is,” he told me. “I'm also not 
imaginative enough to see how some of these 
things could be used as weapons.”
