Mass Education
gonna go back to the community, they need 
education, they need to be able to get a job. 
Otherwise, it's just a vicious cycle.”
The philosophy that helps pitch prison edu­
cation programs, then, stands on two fronts. One, 
that attending college in prison will behaviorally 
reform inmates, decreasing recidivism rates and 
increasing public safety. Two, that education pro­
grams will make inmates more productive in the 
workforce, becoming high-functioning and con­
tributing members of society. 

While these are the principles that help get 
prison education programs through the door, 
they often come with fraught implications.
Hinton argues in her lecture “Second 
Chances: Redemption and Reentry after Prison” 
that reliance on recidivism as a metric further 
reinforces the idea that education is a privilege. 
“It is necessary to redefine education from social 
utility,” Hinton says, “from its purpose being to 
train people to develop useful skills that will 
allow them to succeed in a global capitalist mar­
ket, to individual utility.”
This, Hinton tells me, looks like a world 
where education is afforded to incarcerated stu­
dents simply so they can “understand the world 
better, expand their horizons”—without any 
expectation of capital return. 

Yet, for some students, education is a 
means to an end. Reentry often means low-
wage, labor-intensive jobs at warehouses or 
construction sites. Having a degree opens up 
an entirely different trajectory—the ability to 
make a living. 

Rodriguez describes how in the Bard Prison 
Initiative, some inmates would apply year after 
year: “Every time they keep trying…because they 
see people go home and have good jobs.”
“Wesleyan’s motto was ‘Education for the 
sake of education.’ No one in that program 
was looking to be educated for the sake of edu­
cation,” says Jeter. “It's impossible to be real, 
because learning has been so commodified in 
America…Men and women want to get out. 
They want to get better. They want redemption. 
They want to prove something. So this isn't for 
the sake of education.”
Ultimately, inmates have lives they lead out­
side of prison, and many have hopes of one day 
making their way back to the places and people 
they love. In one of Herrera Soto’s assignments, 
where students were tasked with drawing por­
traits, many turned to the only references they 
had—photos of their children. 

“That was particularly hard because I wasn't 
expecting the effect,” Herrera Soto says. “There's 
nothing that prepared me for going to check 
on people's homework and then they're sharing 
their stories of their kids.”
For one student, prison education was a way of 
reconnecting with her daughter who was finishing 
high school. “She's participating in the YPEI to

show her daughter,” Herrera Soto told me, “…if 
your mom can do it, then it's never too late.”
The Prison-To-College Pipeline
“[Yale] owns New Haven,” says Harvin. “Yeah. 
That's how I felt. That they own it. And maybe 
that they owed something to it?” 
Historically, Yale has a long record of per­
petuating racial and economic inequality in 
New Haven, purchasing large swaths of land, 
over-policing, and limiting local hires—all 
while evading property taxes. The majority of 
students at MacDougall-Walker Correctional 
Institution are from New Haven, Hartford, and 
Bridgeport, directly residing in spaces where Yale 
is implicated.
“Therefore,” says Hinton, “it should be part 
of Yale’s responsibility to share its resources 
with students.” 

Currently, Yale’s investment in the YPEI 
primarily comes through administrative sup­
port, such as faculty and indirect contributions. 
Roland stresses the importance of these resources, 
yet the University’s direct financial commitment 
to the program is “such a low number” that she 
doesn’t share it. “We raise nearly the entire bud­
get for this program through private grants and 
individual donations,” she says. “And it's all funds 
that are raised not through Yale, but through 
Dwight Hall."
Real buy-in from Yale, Hinton says, would 
require an expansion of resources and a shift in 
its educational mission. 

In the past, courses in prison counted as 
overload for faculty—classes they taught on the 
YPEI’s payroll—in addition to a full schedule at 
Yale. A recent administrative win means that now, 
professors can count one credit taught in prison 
as part of their normal workload, covered on the 
University’s dime. In Hinton’s view, this policy 
should apply to all course credits. 

What does this mean for the University’s 
educational goals on campus? 
Rather than a “side project,” Hinton says Yale 
should include educating incarcerated students 
in its primary mission, thus addressing inequali­
ties that are “studied so deeply [at the University] 
but that Yale as an institution has helped to cre­
ate.” This could look like a degree awarded by 
Yale itself—something that the YPEI admin­
istrators I spoke with characterized both as an 
improbable pipe dream and an ultimate goal. 
Hinton calls this the “Prison-to-College 
Pipeline,” a radical reimagining of prisons as a 
space for “mass education,” and a world where 
the transition to college post-release is seamless, 
with institutions like Yale taking the lead in facil­
itating degrees for students upon reentry. 

This is work that the YPEI has already begun 
to undertake. The College-to-Career Fellowship

offers one to two years of funded “professional 
development, career exploration, and mentorship 
opportunities” for formerly incarcerated alumni 
of any prison education program. Students pur­
sue their academic interests, drawing from the 
wealth of resources that Yale offers—professors, 
libraries, mentorship. Roland calls it a “Fulbright 
for formerly incarcerated students.”
Marisol Garcia, a College-to-Career Fellow 
and a graduate of Wesleyan’s Center for Prison 
Education (CPE), is using the Fellowship to 
supplement her exploration of teaching and 
policy, while also pursuing her law degree at the 
University of Vermont. 

“Even let's say people who are not formerly 
incarcerated,” Garcia said. “[To] have an oppor­
tunity for a two-year fellowship at a university as 
large as Yale, with their resources, and their net­
works, and the different opportunities?” 

Initially, Garcia’s many commitments dis­
suaded her from taking on a full-time fellowship, 
but a mentor told her, “You would give up an 
opportunity that would take you multiple life­
times to be able to even explore Yale.”
A Select Few
Hearing about the application process for the 
YPEI, I was surprised by its extensive rigor, some 
components even exceeding what was required 
for my own application to Yale. 

After an initial information session, the 
YPEI invites interested students to submit a 
written component, consisting of three to four 
short answer questions and a longer essay. Next, 
students complete a timed essay in response to 
a prompt—often quotes from literary icons. A 
committee of faculty and formerly incarcerated 
staff read their applications, looking primarily 
for the “desire to engage with questions.” Some 
are then invited to participate in a mock Socratic 
seminar. Finally, a select group of students are 
interviewed. In 2018, out of nearly six hundred 
applicants to the first YPEI class, twelve were 
granted a spot, amounting to an acceptance rate 
of 2 percent.
It follows then, that for participants in the 
YPEI, being a student is a matter of prestige, rep­
licating Yale’s real-world hierarchy and the hos­
tility its exclusivity creates.
“People in the community college programs 
will often subordinate themselves to someone in 
the Yale program. ‘I'm not as smart as you Yale 
dudes,’” Harvin says. “So what it does is, it kind 
of gives the people in that program, rightfully so, 
some level of esteem amongst their peers. It takes 
a lot to get into the program, even more to stay in 
the program, and not just to stay, but to excel in 
the program.”
Yet, in a setting where those I spoke with 
described professors as the only ones who treat 
A YPEI classroom.
