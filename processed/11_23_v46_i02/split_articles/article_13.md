them like humans, what does it mean that this 
program is only accessible to a select few, and 
that “it takes a lot” to excel within it?
“Everyone should understand that education 
is always valuable,” says Francis Ernest, an alum­
nus of the YPEI (‘18). “Most of us wouldn't be 
here if we had education. Right, you will make 
better choices…An educated person doesn't 
commit crime because you understand the reality, 
right?”
Indeed, while prison education is often 
touted as a “second chance,” Hinton argues in 
her lecture that “most incarcerated people never 
had a first chance” at school. With over-po­
licing in historically under-resourced districts, 
many Black and brown youth are funneled into 
places like MacDougall by the school-to-prison 
pipeline. Prison education, then, is the righting 
of a wrong that begins before inmates are even 
incarcerated. 
And it must be treated as such. “Until there's 
legislation that says a person has a right to edu­
cation,” says Ernest, “there's always going to be a 
small amount.”
In a prison setting, this exclusivity runs the 
risk of maintaining the carceral system.
“Prisons do just enough to basically say we’re 
doing something,” says Ernest, “but they don’t 
want to turn prisons into colleges…It’s in your 
best interest not to educate everyone because if 
no one comes back, why would you exist?” 
The YPEI must be funded, developed, and 
nurtured. On this, faculty and students are in 
overwhelming agreement. If Hinton’s vision 
comes to pass, prisons will one day be colleges, 
democratizing education and the humanization 
that can come with it.
At 
MacDougall 
Walker 
Correctional 
Institution, Harvin was referred to by a number: 
403853. 
Today, as I sit in the crowd at Pitts Chapel 
United Free Will Baptist Church, he is intro­
duced by a Bishop who marvels at how three 
days after being released from prison, Harvin 
found himself “on top of a hill at Yale University.” 
Among the sea of friends and family who have 
come to see his first sermon, Harvin shouts out 
one row in particular—his professors at the 
University of New Haven, where he is now com­
pleting his degree. 
“I got some good news,” he says. “Number 
403853 has passed on.”
The crowd cheers; the organ blares; “It’s your 
time!” someone shouts. Harvin ends the sermon 
with a beginning: “Allow me,” he says, “to rein­
troduce myself.”

After his summer teaching for the YPEI, 
Herrera Soto returned to his studio in Erector 
Square, uncertain about what came next for the 
lives he briefly encountered. 
“Something about leaving always felt hard…
Saying bye and then going through a bunch of 
gates and then you drive away,” Herrera Soto says. 
“Yeah. It was kind of gnarly.”
Still, part of him was relieved.
“There's so many contradictions, so many 
things that get in the way sometimes,” he slows, 
cars from the street below droning through the 
silence. “It’s hard to hold the feelings of caring 
for your students. And then that feeling, some­
times in my body, like you shouldn't be in here. 
And I don't know. I don't know if I've resolved 
that for myself.”
Sitting on a crate, Herrera Soto’s silver ear­
ring catches the abundant light of the studio. It’s 
a stark contrast to the darkness of the prison he 
drove to three times a week, in the wet heat of 
mid-July. 
“At Danbury when I taught, all the good and 
bad was also housed within this feeling of dread 
of the prison,” he says. “Every minute you're 
there, there's this feeling. Like you can't leave. 
Like once you're in there…You're in a prison. 
You can't just run out the door.” 
Before I go, Herrera Soto shows me his stu­
dents’ drawings. Just one more, he insists, pausing 
to marvel at each one. It’s a beautiful piece, he 
affirms. Over and over again: “Like objectively, 
just looking at, it’s a beautiful drawing.”
For her final project, one student—Felicia—
drew a self-portrait. Her inked signature is shad­
owed by charcoal. She is the focal point of the 
piece, elevated in a vortex, hair parted by the 
wind. The floating faces of her classmates flock 
out from around her. A sea of eyes, they stare 
at her as we stare at them. We, the viewers, are 
aliens. And we’re abducting her. 
“The fact that she's bigger or the other peo­
ple are smaller. It doesn’t necessarily make sense. 
[But] she's the most important part,” Herrera 
Soto says. “When you're imagining from a dif­
ferent perspective, you’re imagining more of the 
whole…Which is hard for a student.”
He ponders whether the alien is a metaphor 
for wanting to escape. I think about wholeness. 
“Yeah,” he tells me. “It was hard to leave.”∎
