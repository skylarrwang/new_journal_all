Debi Killer talks me through 
her trauma like it’s a grocery 
list. Abusive household. Alcoholic 
father. Foster system at 11. Near-fatal car 
accident at 16. Breast cancer. Stroke and 
complete paralysis at 52. Milk. Eggs. No 
four-leaf clovers. But Killer doesn’t see 
herself as unlucky.
“I’ve had a lot of miracles in my life,” 
she remarks with the throaty voice of 
a sure smoker. There’s nothing divine 
about her endurance, though. She’s just 
tough. “Killer” is a name her friends gave 
the gritty 11-year-old Debi to help her 
remain unidentified when she ran away 
from home. At 62, the faint haunt in her 
eyes tells you she’s had to be as cutthroat 
as the title.
And yet, those eyes are the last 
thing you notice about Killer. They’re 
shielded by her head-to-toe baby-pink 
outfit. Her glasses, bandana, vest, biking 
gloves, sneakers, and lipstick all match 
so closely that you’d think she dyed 
them herself. They also match the bright 
pink ’78 Shovelhead motorcycle that 
she’s been riding for over forty years––
and still rides after making a complete 
recovery from her stroke.
“Because my past was so hard and 
so rough, this is my escape,” she says 
of riding motorcycles. “A lot of peo­
ple bike for that freedom, that relief of 
trauma that they dealt with in life.”
Killer is the president of the 
Connecticut Women Motorcycle Club 
Nomads, a female motorcycle group that 
also holds events to advocate for breast 
cancer awareness. She has seen the num­
ber of female bikers riding in Connecticut 
grow exponentially during her lifetime. 
She founded the group in 1987 with twelve 
“sisters.”  Today, forty-five women ride with 
the Club.
Killer is full of laughter and quick 
with aphorisms. She doesn’t project 
ferocity. She explains that it’s because 
she, along with most of those she’s rid­
den with throughout her life, values 
respect above all else: “It's brotherhood, 
sisterhood, we're tight-knight. If some­
one's broken down on the side of the 
road, I don't care if I know them or not, 
I'm pulling over.”
Biking is all about the community, 
I’m told over and over by bikers across 
the city. Being a biker doesn’t mean just 
owning a bike—it’s when you bike with 
others that you truly become a biker.
Jordan Voss, a 40-year-old biker 
from West Haven, put it simply: “Biking 
alone is like having a party by yourself.” 
It’s an oxymoron. 
Like many bikers I spoke to, Voss 
feels close to the biker community despite 
being unaffiliated with a particular group. 
Five bikers told me that it’s normal to 
ride with different groups on different 
days, joining larger crowds to attend bik­
ing events in far-flung cities. According to 
Killer, there are too many biking groups to 
count, and various groups handle mem­
bership differently. She accepts new riders 
based on a vote of current members along 
the criteria of “no lies, no drugs, no trou­
ble, and no negativity.”
I sit with Voss on cushy leather 
couches in the back of the Owl Shop 
cigar lounge. He smokes Blondie cigars 
and sips bourbon, trading flirty insults 
with the waitress as she comes by. He 
turns the conversation in unexpected 
directions, first toward the Israel-
Hamas war, then to DeSantis versus 
Trump. Then, in an effort to find some 
point of connection between us, Voss 
draws a metaphor. Biking is like being 
an overseas journalist, he says. “You’re so 
motivated to become part of that indus­
try that you’d put yourself in danger.”
Court charges and broken limbs are 
the price some bikers pay to claim the 
identity and image they romanticize—
free, cool, part of something.
Biking is, indeed, an industry: Cue 
Gabriel Canestri Jr. and Salvatore Fusco, 
two bikers based out of New Haven who 
have turned the activity into a business 
and a source of fame. Both men have 
hundreds of thousands of followers on 
Instagram and post videos that regu­
larly garner millions of views. The rapper 
Drake follows Canestri, and 19.2 million 
people have viewed a video the biker 
posted of himself riding a completely 
vertical bike inside the clubhouse where 
he and Fusco work.

“It’s brotherhood, sisterhood, we’re tight-knit. If someone’s broken down on 
the side of the road, I don’t care if I know them or not, I’m pulling over.”

“—people bike 
for that freedom, 
that relief.”

“EVERYTHING WILL KILL YOU.  CHOOSE 
SOMETHING FUN.”
The words loom over the Hole in 
the Wall clubhouse, better known to 
bikers as “The Shop.” Tucked behind an 
abandoned church, The Shop is home 
to the New Haven-based motorcy­
cle merchandise and hard parts brand 
Eastcoastin Crew. The large, open-air 
garage is filled with gleaming Harley-
Davidsons. The walls are plastered with 
stickers and spray-painted tags boast­
ing slogans so stereotypical they come 
across as ironic.
Canestri and Fusco, co-owners 
of Eastcoastin, run up and down the 
clubhouse ramp, wide enough only 
for a single wheel. They tend to the 
bikes with purpose and urgency, halt­
ing their constant motion only to 
noogie the shop dogs. Fusco coaxes 
the handlebar of a bike with precise 
twists of his fingers, his hands black 
with grease.
When Canestri and Fusco started 
Eastcoastin in 2017, it revolutionized 
the New Haven bike scene. They were 
among the first people to attempt 
advanced stunts on Harley-Davidsons, 
which are larger and heavier than other 
motorcycles. The average motorcycle 
weighs about 430 pounds; most Harleys 
weigh between 540 and 905 pounds. 
On these bikes, the men attempt tricks 
such as stoppies, lifting the back wheel
