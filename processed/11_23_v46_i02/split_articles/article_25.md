realized that I’d seen his face before. He 
worked evening shifts at the gym—sta­
tioned at the front desk every time I 
walked in. 

We didn’t speak in real life, other 
than a hey, which signaled a history. 
Sometimes, I’d tilt my head up—cran­
ing over his coworkers to see him—and 
almost smile. I did not want him, but I 
tried to act the part. 

I started dressing differently. I 
swapped my sweatpants out for jer­
sey shorts with a 7-inch inseam. How 
my thighs curved. How my calves 
mounted to a peak. I became infatuated 
with myself and the skin I could show. 
Summer is a good time to be hot. 

Outside of the gym, I wore the 
collared shirts my mother always told 
me would make me look powerful. 
Sometimes I’d wear them to the gym, if I 
hadn’t had time to change at home, and 
he’d message me afterwards. You looked 
good today. He reminded me that some­
one was looking. 

I was desired, so hotness became my 
reality. It was something which I could 
exercise and embody. I had been addicted 
to the idea that beauty could connect me 
to the world, but here was hotness doing 
the same. Acceptance—the passive exis­
tence that beauty bought—was no lon­
ger enough. I had worked to be wanted 
conditionally and achieve success in the 
economy of desire. And I enjoyed the gig. 

I feigned seduction with gym guy 
for the rest of the summer. He texted me, 
and I would text back days later. One day 
in late July, I opened Tinder after a week 
of no contact to find that his icon had 
vanished. I thought about seeing him 
again and began to work out exclusively 
in the mornings.

n late August, I moved into my house 
in New Haven. The school year started, 
and I began going to the gym regularly 
again. When the weather allowed, I 
wore collared shirts and left two buttons 
undone for my 9 a.m. English seminar. 
My roommate called it slutty. 

Gradually, inevitably, the weather 
turned cold and cotton shirts became 
impractical. I layered on knit wool and 
began looking in the mirror less and 
less. What was there to see but fabric? 
Who was there to please with my crew 
neck sweaters?  

Without gym guy, there was no 
second set of eyes grounding hotness in 
reality. Its allure returned to my mind, 
where it joined beauty in the place where 
images reside. It was impossible to make 
either fully physical and present. 

It became more and more difficult to 
look in the mirror—to make a conscious 
choice in how I looked. 

The picture of my grandfather 
ceased to be anything more than an 
image stored on my phone. And like 
that version of him, my season of hot­
ness has become history. The age of 
looking is over.∎
