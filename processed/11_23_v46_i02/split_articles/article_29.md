“It is true that there is not enough beauty in the world. 
It is also true that I am not competent to restore it. 
Neither is there candor, and here I may be of some use.”
- Louise Glück, “October”

I
t was this very candor that char­
acterized our first interaction. I was a 
freshman at the time, and a friend who 
was enrolled in her workshop offered to 
introduce us if I walked her to class early. 
Nervous and giddy, I followed my friend 
into the seminar room and approached 
the head of the table. My literary idol 
looked surprisingly casual in her scarf 
and navy blue coat. “It’s so nice to meet 
you, Professor Gloock,” I said, hast­
ily pronouncing the last name with an 
exaggerated vowel, as in glucose. “You’ve 
been a huge inspiration for my poetry.” 
She looked at me and, without malice 
or warmth, said, “it’s pronounced Glück,” 
pronouncing the umlaut like the word 
“Buick” with the two vowels melded into 
one. Then she moved on with her class. 
Embarrassed as I felt, I was also amused 
that the real-life Louise Glück was just as 
straightforward as the one I’d encountered 
on the page. 


I first came across Glück’s criti­
cal essays as a 16-year-old poet. At the 
time, I was torn between loving poetry 
and hating what I deemed its self-im­
portant discourse. Many American 
poets, seeing the general public’s disdain 
for their work, responded by doubling 
down on praise of one another’s writ­
ing, making sweeping statements about 
poetry’s urgency rather than demon­
strating it. Glück was the first writer I 
found who departed from this ostenta­
tious tone. She wrote with clear passion 
for poetry’s inexhaustible mystery, and 
at the same time diagnosed contempo­
rary poetry’s drift toward self-obsession 
and fruitless abstraction, warning of the 
conditioned responses such tendencies 
evoked. Contemporary literary journals, 
she argued, are full of “poems in which 
secrets are disclosed with athletic avid­
ity…poems at once formulaic and inco­
herent.” I shivered at her recognition of 
the precise kind of poetry I had begun 
to write in hope of publication. She 
unveiled a new vocabulary for discussing 
poetry: one of aesthetics, form, and tone, 
one that recognized how poetry existed 
to make the world both more clear and 
more strange. In a sea of poets and 
critics who were constantly selling the 
importance of this or that work, Glück’s 
rejection of bullshit made her the only 
voice I could trust. 


It took me a couple years to explore 
Glück’s verse itself. Perhaps because I 
found her essays so incisive, I worried 
that her lines might disappoint me. They 
didn’t. Here, too, Glück rejected perfor­
mative drama for a deliberate and dis­
tant voice, one whose authority stilled 
you, whose scathing irony made you 
listen close and allowed glimpses of vul­
nerable beauty to cut ever more deeply. 
Take “Celestial Music,” which begins, “I 
have a friend who still believes in heaven. 
/ Not a stupid person, yet with all she 
knows, she literally talks to God.” Cruel 
and prosaic as Glück sounds here, she 
earns my trust. Having chuckled at her 
friend, I become receptive to her praise 
of this friend’s bravery, her disclosure of 
their shared affinity for wholeness, and 
the stunning ending when the two look 
upon a dead caterpillar and Glück writes, 
“It’s this stillness that we both love. / The 
love of form is a love of endings.” 


Whenever I was skeptical of poetry 
and deprived of inspiration, I returned 
to Glück’s texts. During the pan­
demic, I convinced my parents to rent 
an Airbnb near Alabama’s Lake Smith. 
We sat outside, the cicadas humming 
all around, the host’s labrador curled 
up at my feet, and read Glück’s poetry. 
For my parents, two Eastern European 
emigres who’d grown up on the Russian 
poetic tradition, Glück’s poems, as 
lucid in image and thought as those 
of Mandelstam and Akhmatova, were 
among those few which resonated with 
them. The three of us connected in our 
shared marveling. After my parents 
went to bed, I walked out on the dock 
and sat there for several hours with my 
Kindle copy of Averno. Periodically, I 
set down the glowing screen to look up 
at the stars, listen to the water, and let 
the words echo. I hope she will forgive 
my pathos here.


Glück’s poetry seminar was offered 
every fall semester, but through a con­
fluence of bad luck and trepidation 
at working closely with someone I 
admired, year after year passed with­
out me enrolling. My first year, I was 
so weary of poetry that I didn’t apply; 
my second year, after regaining passion 
for poetry through Glück’s work, I was 
accepted into the course, but it was 
unexpectedly canceled; my third year, 
I was rejected. Only this semester did 
I finally enroll in the Iseman Seminar. 
My parents were overjoyed. I studied up 
on the umlaut and, thankfully, Professor 
Glück seemed to have forgotten 
about my mispronunciation of her 
name all those years ago.


The Louise Glück I met in 
the Iseman Seminar was consis­
tent with the one I’d read—just 
as unpretentious and honest, just 
as cautious of tropes and senti­
mentality. As in her texts, her 
directness, though sometimes 
ruthless, garnered complete 
trust. Yet despite the darkness 
of much of her poetry, she was 
also surprisingly jovial. I loved 
how comfortably she passed 
aesthetic judgements with no 
need for explanation. “This word is 
off,” she would say, or “this line should 
be replaced with another,” identifying 
problems the ear understands better than 
the mind and trusting us to find solutions. 
She hated unnecessary adjectives and 
loved specificity, especially geographic. In 
one of my poems, she suggested scrap­
ping almost every line except one 
which was merely a descrip­
tion of place: “through 
Cuneo, they came to 
Florence.” She vehe­
mently rejected bull­
shit, not only poetic 
but also interpersonal. 
Despite being a Nobel 
laureate, she was never 
condescending—joking frequently with us, 
never insisting on decorum. She seemed 
to be less an instructor than a peer, seated 
at the same round table as the rest of us.


I won’t pretend that we became 
fast friends in the five weeks of class we 
had together, as much as I would love 
to indulge such a fiction. We had class 
in person twice, and I never made it to 
her in-person office hours. One after­
noon, however, we discussed a couple 
poems of mine over the phone. I sat in 
my sunny dining room and typed madly 
in an attempt to write down her every 
word, her every criticism of every line, her 
divulgence that writing prose poetry was 
one of the most enthralling experiences of 
her life. When she made the off-handed 
disclosure that she liked my poems, my 
heart leaped. As the call was drawing 
to a close, there was a brief 
but seemingly endless 
silence in which I thought of asking 
something deeper, beyond the minu­
tiae of my lines—about the usefulness 
of rhyme, about the disarming poten­
tial of prosaic language, about writing 
from beyond a singular I, about decod­
ing Ashbery and understanding Oppen. 
There was so much I wanted to ask her 
that I hardly knew where to begin. 


There will be time for those ques­
tions later, I decided, so why keep her 
now? I said, “Thank you so much, see 
you soon,” and she said, “See you.”∎
