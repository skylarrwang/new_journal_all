**Title: When the Paint Dries**

O 
n october 4th, 1984, a group 
of Yale students carried cans full 
of paint into the Lillian Goldman 
Law Library. Some hands grabbed boxes 
of catalog cards. They dusted the floor 
with delicate slips, dropping hundreds 
of hours of work—in paper catalogs—
onto the ground. They painted “Support 
Local 34” in massive letters in red across 
the center of the reading room car­
pet. More notes in support of Local 34 
defaced sections of the floor. Smaller 
messages littered carrels throughout the 
building. “Shut it down,” the wooden 
walls decried. The protestors left one 
catalog card propped up in the center 
of the library. It implored Yale to accept 
the worker’s binding arbitration. They 
left the building before any workers 
entered, leaving the door locked behind 
them. The vandals were not caught. 

For months prior to the incident, 
tension had been mounting throughout 
Yale’s campus. In response to being sig­
nificantly underpaid, a cohort of clerical 
and technical Yale employees, which 
were 82 percent female at the time, 
unionized and formed Local 34 and 
Local 35. Protests followed, culminat­
ing in more than five thousand people 
demanding that Yale meet the workers’ 
demands. Subsequent teach-ins, faculty 
reports, and worker testimonials shed 
light on the discrimination occurring. 

Despite these protests and the flood of 
information, Yale remained steadfast in 
meager compromises, insisting that they 
were paying staff fairly. They maintained 
vague policies regarding free speech. 
Police shut down nonviolent protests 
despite them conforming to policies, 
and some professors harassed students, 
with one writing to a protesting student 
that other faculty members were “out 
for his scalp.” Yale stood behind those 
who shut down transgressions. Workers 
went on strike throughout October and 
November of 1984. Picket lines blocked 
off buildings and classes moved into 
off-campus locations like the Grove 
Street Cemetery. 

Critical
In the battle against 
student and administrative apathy, the 
vandals chose an emotive outburst as 
their weapon. They transgressed author­
ity—in this instance, Yale—by harming 
its property. Maria Jose Hierro, a professor 
of political science at Yale, says that van­
dalism, when linked to protest, “relates 
to emotions, to anger, to frustration, to 
some form or feeling that is the outcome 
of a grievance...it calls the attention of the 
authority but it’s about the individual’s 
expression.” Perhaps the vandals felt their 
voices and faces were not enough. They 
needed a faceless, bright red, and massive 
expression, one that explicitly defies the 
authority, to demand their acknowledg­
ment. They expressed themselves in a way 
that cannot be ignored. 

And they weren’t alone. Yale’s history 
of vandalism adorns each social move­
ment. With each major twentieth century 
protest—the Black Panthers, anti-Apart­
heid in South Africa, anti-Gulf War 
intervention—came a slew of shattered 
glass, graffitied walls, and broken doors. 
This act of vandalism in 1984 con­
tained an attempt at strategy. A mem­
ber of the group anonymously called 
reporters of the Yale Daily News. She 
claimed that Yale was oblivious to stu­
dents bearing the brunt of the strike, 
stating that she was tired of having 
classes in a graveyard and “wanted to 
bring it close to home to end student 
apathy.” She explicitly distanced the 
vandals’ actions as separate from the 
Union and the University. 
The Union, writing to 
the News in response, 
claimed that such tac­
tics only harmed their 
movement. Another stu­
dent in the News wrote 
that such actions were 
cowardly because they 
hid themselves behind 
anonymity, not allow­
ing for conversational 
responses. 
Allies—
including the very 
Union 
itself—crit­
icized the medium 
of the transgression, 
with little regard 
for its message, in 
response to van­
dalism. Attention 
heeded, but con­
versations shut down.
Vandalism often incurs controversy, 
allowing for others to criticize the move­
ment due to its destruction rather than the 
message of the movement itself. For Hierro, 
the strategic calculus of vandalism seldom 
justifies it. “One wants to disrupt authority 
without thinking about the consequences 
of those actions and how those conse­
quences distort your message,” she says. 
“You get a lot of pushback from potential 
allies or the authority.” 

The consequences of these actions 
go further than disagreeability. In a 
News report, a Law Librarian Morris 
Cohen remarked that the main individ­
uals affected by the actions were those 
that had to clean it up. Though prop­
erty damage may appear to disrupt the 
authority that manages it, those who 
steward the property are often more 
affected than the superseding authority.

B
ut what if vandalism’s transgression 
is creative instead of destructive? 
Here we encounter graffiti, where the 
defiance of authority becomes the basis 
of community.
Kevin Repp, the curator of the 
Beinecke’s current exhibit—“Art, Protest, 
and the Archives”—talks through sev­
eral of these examples. “Art,” he says, “can 
sit on the edge of violence.” He tells me 
this as we sit between cases with Dadaist 
works that gesture to the horrors of 
World War I and photos of the Sioux art 
tent pipeline protests in South Dakota. In 
each instance, people were bound by the 
art they formed. He tells me that certain 
artistic communities, brought together 
through creation, retain their energy by 
implicit transgression. To him, art’s trans­
gression either unfolds through straight­
forward messages or by directing the 
viewer’s emotions against reason using 
shock. In each instance, art challenges 
an authority’s narrative, either by ques­
tioning or offering a counternarrative. By 
maintaining this challenge, art edges on 
violence. And, centered around the edge 
where art subsists, people come together.
Graffiti can tie people together 
through transgressive narratives just 
as art does. Hierro recalls a summer 
she spent teaching in Barcelona where 
student organizations painted murals 
advocating for socialism, independence, 
and women’s rights. “To me, those were 
very artistic, and they were art—in the 
sense that they were trying to leave an 
imprint, in the walls of their university, 
of their ideals.” 

In other instances, people call for 
empathy through art. She tells me 
about graffiti on walls in Mexico and 
in Palestine. “Why are they in English?” 
she asks. “Because they are seeking the 
solidarity of people in other places in the 
world.” Uniting around the defiance of a 
common authority, graffiti can combine 
art’s coalescing power with vandalism’s 
transgression to sustain a community.
T
he frustration with Yale as an 
authority, both in dictating permis­
sible expression and in determining 
institutional action, remains. Yet Yale’s 
campus remains mostly pristine. In the 
last decade, the only publicized acts of 
property damage have been hate speech 
graffitied onto overlooked public spaces. 
Why are these the most visible afterlives 
of vandalism? What’s changed?
An initial explanation is that Yale 
focuses more on its community than ever 
before. Joey Adcock, an area manager 
for the campus, pulls out a graffiti-re­
moval spray can from his desk drawer 
as he describes this shift. “I’ve wanted 
service staff to be seen, to show we take 
care of the place, that we care enough 
to be out in public and be a resource 
for those around us,” he says, “and as a 
result, custodial staff are more respected.” 
The consideration for those who are 
harmed by property damage seems 
to have landed with some students.
