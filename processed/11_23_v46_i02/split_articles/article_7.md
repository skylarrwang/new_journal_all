When Leah Margulies spotted McClure at 
the Conference, she had already heard a rumor 
about a red-headed first-year at Yale with rock 
band experience. Marguiles moved to New 
Haven in 1968 and started practicing the flute 
along the way. She yearned to play in an 
all-female band. 

Virginia “Ginny” Blaisdell went to 
the Conference because “everyone was.” 
Her best friend, Naomi Weisstein, was 
a speaker at the Conference and would 
go on to start the Chicago Women’s 
Liberation Rock Band at the same time 
the New Haven chapter came together. 
The sister bands remained in close 
contact throughout their careers—
it didn’t hurt that New Haven’s 
Jennifer Abod and Chicago’s Susan 
Abod were sisters. 

Eight women in their early 
20s made up the New Haven 
Women’s 
Liberation 
Rock 
Band. The other core mem­
bers were Harriet Cohen, who 
played guitar, Florika Remetier 
and Pat Ouellette, who played 
bass, and Judy Miller, who played 
drums. Kate Field ’75 and Anna 
Tsing Lowenhaupt ’73—who, like 
McClure, were also in Yale’s first 
class of women—joined briefly. 

The women were united by their 
disgust with the blatant sexism of 
rock music. Weisstein and Blaisdell 
explained this feeling in their 1972 
article, “Feminist Rock: No More 
Balls and Chains” for Ms. magazine: 
“Rock has become more blatantly, 
menacingly sexist than anything that 
had preceded it.” 

In the late nineteen-sixties 
and early nineteen-seventies, rock 
music championed rugged mascu­
linity. Groups like The Rolling Stones 
and Led Zeppelin created what crit­
ics termed “cock rock”—aggressively 
asserting masculinity by standing with 
their legs wide open, mimicking sex 
with their guitars, and singing about 
empty-minded, sexually subservient 
girls. The Rolling Stones’ “Under My 
Thumb,” for example, compares a girl 
to “a squirming dog” and “Siamese cat” 
that “does just what she’s told…under 
my thumb.” In 1967, Jimi Hendrix pre­
tended to rape his guitar on stage. Cock 
rock’s sexual aggression extended beyond 
lyrics and performances and reflected the 
prevalent sexual violence women endured. 

In 1968, at the Sky River rock festival, 
three women were gang raped and one 
woman was stabbed while trying to escape. 

Even amid this hostile landscape, 
the New Haven Liberation Band’s first 
concert at Delta Kappa Epsilon was an 
uproarious success. The band distributed 
tambourines and lyric sheets, performed 
comedy and theater, and spoke candidly 
to their audience mid-performance. By 
refusing to distance themselves as rock 
stars, they engaged their audience as 
equals. The Band reinvented the rock 
concert experience from a spectator 
sport to a participatory celebration. In 
1976, Blaisdell wrote in Sister, New 
Haven’s first feminist magazine, that 
the band “had somehow momentar­
ily succeeded in creating an event 
that incorporated [their] vision of 
a better society because it changed 
the way performers and audiences 
behaved with each other.”

T
he Band challenged the sex­
ism of rock music by inserting 
their feminist, affirmative, and 
humanitarian visions. “We were 
first and most necessarily femi­
nists. Only second were we musi­
cians,” Blaisdell wrote in 1976. 

In their Ms. magazine article, 
Weisstein and Blaisdell defined 
their music as “musical organiz­
ing.” Through their lyrics, they 
deconstructed women’s oppres­
sion in order to empower them. 
The Band sang about the whole­
hearted female experience: “...our 
strengths and dignity and courage 
and humor and honor and love and 
uniqueness and wisdom, our joy as 
well as our pain.”

Songs emphasized everything 
from resistance to solidarity.  In 
“Sister Witch,” the Band sings, 
“When I feel my 
sister’s embrace, there’s all the 
space and the love that I need. Yes, we 
need each other.”

But to combat sexism, the Band 
wanted to do more than subvert lyr­
ics. They wanted, as Weisstein and 
Blaisdell wrote, to “demystify the 
priesthood of the instrument and 
the amplifier.” Because women play­
ing music, especially rock music, was 
unheard of at the time, the Band, by 
playing their instruments, moving and 
fixing their equipment, and recording 
by themselves, wished to strengthen 
female autonomy and self-confidence. 
“It’s hard to imagine how much of a 
man’s world it was at that time,” Alper 
said. “It was almost as if women were 
like cows or horses or some species that 
couldn’t possibly figure out how to play an 
electric guitar.” 

When the Band played at women’s 
conferences, they would often hold work­
shops afterward on how to play rock music 
with their own instruments. 

“Our mission was to open the rock 
music world to women and show them 
that they could be rock musicians too,” 
Margulies explained.

For the members who had never 
played rock music or been inside a 
recording 
studio 
before, 
McClure, 
Florika, and Blaisdell—who each previ­
ously had ten to twenty years of train­
ing—acted as their mentors, writing 
songs and teaching their less-experi­
enced members how to perform. 

hroughout the Band’s four-
year course, members’ personal 
lives were intrinsically linked with 
the intersectional causes they 
championed. Influenced by the 
Because women playing music, especially 
rock music, was unheard of at the time, the 
Band, by playing their instruments, moving 
and fixing their equipment, and recording 
by themselves, wished to strengthen female 
autonomy and self-confidence.

gay liberation movement, some members saw 
same-sex relationships as the logical answer to 
their past romantic struggles with men and their 
feminist resistance. 

Everyone broke up with their former part­
ners and experimented with their sexualities. “I 
played with whoever I wanted to,” Blaisdell said. 
She divorced her husband. Marguiles ended her 
marriage to explore polygamous and lesbian 
relationships. Alper broke up with her boy­
friend. Abod came out as a lesbian. McClure 
frequented a gay bar near Yale. 

“We talked about how oppressed we were 
and how much men suck,” Alper described. “It 
was very disruptive and upsetting. There were 
a lot of hurt feelings and conflict. Nothing 
about our lives was placid.” 

Many of the women also joined femi­
nist consciousness-raising groups, tight-
knit clusters of women that would speak 
and share their intimate feelings and needs. 
While some of the members were 
close friends or had romantic relation­
ships with one another, other members 
of the Band merely toler­
ated one another or didn’t 
get along as well. Despite 
their enlivening and exhilarat­
ing performances on stage, the 
Band frequently fought off stage. 

“It was pandemonium,” Rika 
said. “We fought about every­
thing and nothing.” 

When Marguiles married in 
1968, her parents offered to either 
give her some money or pay for an 
elaborate wedding. Marguiles chose 
the money and bought a van for the 
Band. The Band agreed that all money 
earned from their gigs would be used 
communally on food, equipment, and 
transportation expenses. They charged 
each audience member only the amount 
they could afford to pay. “There was no 
financial interest,” Alper said. 

O
n December 13, 1970, the Band had 
the unforgettable thrill of performing 
at a prison in Niantic, 
Connecticut. Blaisdell wrote, 
“The [prison] was buzzing 
with an incipient politi­
cal consciousness.” Two 
to three hundred incar­
cerated 
people, 
mostly 
young Black women, sat 
in the gym, bobbing up 
and down and yelling in 
their seats. They were 
not allowed to dance, 
but they did so none­
theless. Every time a 
guard 
motioned 
for 
one dancer to sit down, 
another dancer would 
pop up on the other 
side of the room.

of 
these 
women was Ericka 
Huggins, a leading 
member of the Black 
Panther Party, who

wrote a poem inspired by the 
performance. 

She 
describes 
the solidarity she felt blossom 
across racial lines: “it was all 
a total exchange / of energy…
they sang / and our voices 
answered their guitars…a feel­
ing there that one day—soon— 
/ all people will be free…we left 
/ stronger / able to smile.” 

Moved 
by 
the 
crowd’s 
energy in defiance of the guards, 
the Band extended their perfor­
mance until the prison matron 
made them stop. 

But at Cornell University, 
where the New Haven Band 
played alongside the Chicago 
Band, the women’s presence 
provoked outrage. Most of the 
all-female audience took their 
shirts 
off 
mid-performance. 
Male students at Cornell—
overhearing this and feeling 
enraged by what they felt was 
exclusion—stormed the concert 
venue, calling the Band mem­
bers “cunts” and hurling things at 
them. Police were called to evac­
uate the Band and the attendees. 

Despite this incident, the Band 
still received overwhelmingly 
positive responses from their 
female audiences. 

“People were thrilled with 
us,” Alper said. “It was so novel to 
hear music with these types of 
lyrics and to see women 
jumping up and 
down 
with 
an electric instrument.” The Band devel­
oped a loyal, young, and female New 
Haven fan base that would follow them 
to every concert, which stunned the 
members. “It seems magical that people 
knew we were playing in another city,” 
Alper said. 

In the fall of 1971, Marian Levy 
approached McClure at a concert and 
asked if the Band was interested in mak­
ing a record. Levy was the co-founder of 
Rounder Records, a self-described “politi­
cal collective as well as a record company.” 
The Band agreed but felt completely 
unprepared. “The idea was preposterous 
and terrifying,” Blaisdell wrote. “We were 
so perplexed by the enormity of the idea 
and also anxious to talk about the polit­
ical implications of what we had been 
doing for a year.” 

The New Haven chapter of the Band 
was then invited to a recording studio in 
Southboro, Massachusetts for a week­
end to record the album alongside their 
Chicagoan counterpart. Levy left the two 
bands to themselves, saying, “It was also 
part of the political point being made, 
which is that women can not only make 
their own music, they can have creative 
control over their own music. And so, 
they did.” 

In 1972, the New Haven and Chicago 
Women’s Liberation Rock Bands released 
their sole album, Mountain Moving Day, 
which sold a few thousand copies across 
college towns and feminist bookstores. 

I
n 1973, the Band was invited by The 
Furies Collective, a group of lesbian sep­
aratists that viewed lesbianism as a politi­
cal decision, to Washington D.C. to play 
for what they assumed was a public dance. 
But it was the Furies’ private party, the 
Band realized.

Outraged, Blaisdell saw the incident 
as a sign that the movement “began to 
therapize itself” and that women would 
choose their personal pursuits over col­
lective activism. She wrote, “We con­
sidered ourselves the ‘cultural arm’ of 
feminism, but it wasn’t clear that fem­
inism wanted such an arm or knew 
what to do with it.” 

By 1974, as the feminist 
movement 
waned, 
members 
of the New Haven Women’s 
Liberation Rock Band no 
longer felt they were ful­
filling their purpose. “Our 
era was coming to an 
end,” Rika said. “Roe v. 
Wade was passed. The 
anti-war movement was coming 
to a close.” 

The Band was splintering. 
During her time with the Band, 
Marguiles became a member of 
Sullivanian Therapy, a cult that 
practiced radical psychoanalysis, 
communal living, and polygamy, 
and refused to compromise with 
other members who didn’t support 
her beliefs. Unbeknownst to the 
other members, McClure struggled 
with alcohol and substance abuse. 
Eventually, encouraged by a psychol­
ogy student at Yale, McClure sought 
therapy in New York and could no 
longer play in the New Haven Band. 

In 1974, four years after its founding, 
the original New Haven Women’s 
Liberation Rock Band disbanded. 

Abod 
said, “We 
had a right to 
do this, and it might 
not have come out 
as well as we wanted. 
The people after us will 
do it better, but we had 
to do it for the first time.”
