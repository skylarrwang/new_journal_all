The stress is palpable for doulas Frasier 
and Westbrook. They recall providers looking 
overworked and understaffed when accom­
panying patients to Yale New Haven 
Hospital. Telfer and Muhammad 
also described an atmosphere 
of staff burnout and fatigue. 
“Turnover 
has 
been 
dramatic,” Telfer said. “I 
barely know any of the 
nurses there. A lot of 
the ones who have been 
there for many years 
have left to do other 
things—they are very 
unhappy with the pres­
sure and the lack of safety 
at times of having to care 
for too many people at once.” 
Executive Director Sparer 
said that while several senior 
nurses left during the pandemic and 
there has been turnover among midwives at the 
hospital, retention has been very high among 
younger nurses. 

According to Westbrook, one of the patients 
she was working with was scheduled for a 
C-section at Yale New Haven Hospital so that 
the birth would be over before the doctor went 
on vacation. State Senator Robyn Porter, whose 
district includes New Haven, said she spoke with 
a woman who felt pressured to get an epidural 
she did not want. A close friend, who Porter con­
siders her non-biological niece, had a traumatic 
experience at Yale New Haven Hospital. She 
believes it resulted in the loss of her infant at five 
months old. 

Frasier said some of her clients wanted to 
deliver at Saint Raphael because of its reputation 
for patient-centered, low-intervention care but 
were disappointed to learn that they no longer 
had the option.
“Our practice from the last few years—the 
midwifery model is barely there. It is a very busy 
labor unit,” Telfer said. “We’re not providing the 
kind of model that midwifery is known for and 
actually reduces bad outcomes—reducing unnec­
essary Cesareans, preterm labor, preterm birth, 
NICU admission—because we’re not able to give 
full patient-centered care experience.” 

A Safe Beginning
Muhammad kneels next to a woman, per­
forming a vital check before a weekly prenatal 
group meeting. She and a medical assistant mea­
sure the woman’s blood pressure, pulse, weight, 
and fundal height—the distance from the pubic 
bone to the top of the uterus—to make sure fetal 
growth is on track.
“How are you feeling?” Muhammad asks. She 
wears a salmon-pink headwrap that matches her 
scrubs and speaks slowly, with a steady calmness. 
“Do you have any concerns?” An interpreter next 
to her translates her words into Spanish. 

Next to Muhammad, the members of the 
prenatal group sit in a circle of chairs, some 
accompanied by their partners. A projector plays 
a video about breastfeeding on the wall. A table 
with tortilla chips, dip, and a veggie platter stands 
in the corner. In the hallway outside, a red sign 
reads “Keep Calm and Call the Midwife.” 

The prenatal group convenes weekly to build 
community between parents and provide infor­
mation beyond what Muhammad can cover 
during a twenty-minute consultation. During the 
sessions, Muhammad isn’t as much of a lecturer 
as she is a facilitator. The women share concerns 
they’ve noticed, such as swollen feet, brittle nails, 
and heartburn, and share tips and solutions. They 
talk about the importance of healthy relation­
ships during pregnancy. The final question of the 
day is “how would you like to enjoy the rest of 
your pregnancy?” 

The session ends, as it does every week, 
with a breathing exercise. Muhammad puts 
on an acoustic track. Everyone stands up and 
breathes together: in through the nose, out 
through the mouth. 
“This is how I want you to breathe during 
labor,” Muhammad says. “This is how I want you 
to breathe if you need to get a C-section.” 

Following Muhammad, everyone in the room 
reaches their arms up towards the ceiling. Behind 
them, the guitar swells.∎
