I 
left for Oxford in January of 
2023, expecting that my life would 
be different there. I had spent the 
past four months in New Haven, in 
pain. First, it was swelling in the tis­
sue around my heart, which left me 
popping a dozen Ibuprofen a day 
to keep the feeling of a heart attack 
at bay. Then came the body aches 
and headaches, a product of stress 
and sleepless nights. At night, panic 
attacks brought the feeling that my 
chest was collapsing, my throat per­
manently closing. These were pains 
reserved for the United States; I 
imagined they would disappear on 
the other side of the Atlantic.

Then the insomnia came. Weeks 
after I could feasibly use jet lag as an 
explanation, I spent the hours between 
two and five a.m. laying awake in a suf­
focating room, lit only by the gray light 
of the low-hanging moon and the blue 
light of my phone screen. One night, I 
stayed awake simply because I was too 
afraid to go back to sleep. I had dreamt 
that my body was rotting from the soul 
outward, heart crumbling like stale 
bread, muscles going green, then black, 
bones eroding like brittle rocks. I woke 
up to stop the decay.

E
xcellence has always been the 
bar in my life. 
After years of academic achieve­
ment and extracurricular success, my 
friends and family have begun to oper­
ate under the assumption that I will 
regularly do extraordinary things. Their 
friends know me only through their 
stories and have come to see me as—to 
quote one of them—“a unicorn.” This 
picture of me grows all the more mythic 
by my being Black and from the west 
side of Chicago. I’m the first person that 
family friends and people in the neigh­
borhood know that has gone to Yale 
—whenever I come home, I field eager 
questions about the big things I have 
done and the big things I have planned. 
When I came back to Chicago for a few 
days this past summer, I ran into a friend 
of my mom’s on the street. He immedi­
ately introduced his children, told them 
where I went, and said they had to live 
up to what I had done with my life.

I go to a university made concrete to 
people from home only through movies 
and TV shows and rumors about the Ivy 
League—I have become an embodiment 
of their hopes. I am supposed to be the 
wealthy East-Coaster bold enough to 
leave Chicago, or the Black president 
that actually decides to help our com­
munity, or the public intellectual doing 
book talks and speaking tours. Whatever 
I become, it must be high-profile, but 
it cannot take me too far from home. I 
should be the one they can brag about 
at their churches and offices, but I need 
to stay generous and within reach. I 
have to say yes to every opportunity I 
get, because how often do people like 
me, from where I’m from, get them? It’s 
crucial that I take risks, but I have to be 
so, so careful because the world’s expec­
tations for me are much different than 
those of my family. 

When America acquitted George 
Zimmerman and forced me to read those 
headlines with my fourth-grade eyes, the 
country laid the possibilities for my life 
before me. Criminality, death, or both. I, 
from the west side of Chicago, will never 
be the Black president who started his 
political career in my hometown. I, Black 
boy from the west side of Chicago, will 
find bullets in my back or handcuffs on 
my wrists, or both, if I step out of line. I 
strove to meet my community’s expecta­
tions so that I could avoid settling into 
the world’s.

But when you carry the expectation 
of excellence into Yale, it’s easy for this 
place to collapse your identity. My time 
here would only be useful if I achieved 
those things worth bragging about, those 
things which definitively placed me on 
What is the cost of excellence?
