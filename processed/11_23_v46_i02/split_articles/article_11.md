In his application for the fellowship, Herrera Soto wrote about his older brother who was incarcerated. During visits, a glass window stood between them. The separation was part of what brought him to the craft of drawing. The “technique of seeing and looking” became a way to better understand his memories. Yet, a summer teaching in prison challenged him to ask: in the art of rendition, is the truth only what appears?
“Part of [one] assignment was to draw outside,” he tells me, describing students’ apprehension about including the fence. “As your instructor, I want to say that it's your choice, if you're going to use the chain link fence as evidence of what you actually see. But also…omission is a creative decision to maybe get at a deeper truth or more of the truth. And I had the students [say] to me, ‘Alright, from here on out, no more fences.’”


In the summer he taught at Danbury, Hererra Soto joined a host of Yale and University of New Haven faculty who teach in the Yale Prison Education Initiative—a Dwight Hall program founded in 2016 by Yale alumna Zelda Roland ’08, GSAS ’16. Each semester, the YPEI hosts approximately thirteen classes at MacDougall Walker Correctional Institution and Danbury Federal Correctional Institution, with between seven to fifteen students in each course. The YPEI is a member of the Bard Prison Initiative's nationwide Consortium for the Liberal Arts in Prison, which runs programs from fifteen universities across ten states. 

The partnership between universities and prisons can occupy a tenuous space, particularly given the difficulties plaguing both institutions. Citing students, with soaring fees, post-graduate employment in limbo, and faculty bogged down by bureaucratic bloat, media and academics have claimed that the University is in crisis. The Prison, too, has been decried for its inhumane conditions, and the disproportionate representation of low-income BIPOC in its surging populations. For two institutions that have accumulated a barrage of negative media coverage over the past few decades, prison education programs present a unique opportunity to change the narrative.

From a PR perspective, it’s not difficult to see the benefits of hosting a program like the YPEI for an institution like Yale. Last year’s graduation alone turned up more than sixty hits from a quick Google search, with nationwide media outlets such as AP News, PBS, and NBC picking up the story. The Yale name finds itself front and center in this coverage, with headlines including “The Jail to Yale Journey” and “Seven Prisoners Earn College Degrees from Top World University.”
“As you can probably tell,” Roland tells me, “the University is celebrating this program in a big way. It's taking a lot of credit for what we're doing. And what we're hoping for is that it will lead to better investment and buy-in.”

When Roland initially pitched the program to the Connecticut Department of Corrections, the Commissioner stopped her mid-spiel: he’d been waiting for someone at Yale to propose this idea for years.
“For me, the prison system in Connecticut always wanted us inside it,” Roland explains. “Yale was the holdup.”

Ultimately, while the YPEI bears the Yale name, degrees are awarded by the University of New Haven—a decision informed in part by logistics (Yale doesn’t offer Associate Degrees), and in part by exclusivity.
“There's always a tacit awareness that the selective nature of elite universities in the United States necessarily means that only a few can have something that's valuable,” says Peter Crumlish, Director of Dwight Hall. Extending that education to more people—particularly incarcerated people—breaks down Yale’s value system. “And you hear people saying, well, what about people who aren't incarcerated who are deserving? Shouldn’t we start with them?”

This question of merit—who deserves an education, particularly a Yale education—clouds the rollout of the program. For faculty and students within the YPEI, higher education is a means of reclaiming inmates’ humanity in prisons and paving a better life post-release. Yet, resources and funding constraints mean that only a select few can access this legitimizing force. In a setting where release isn’t guaranteed, performance post-prison still seems to be the prevailing metric that matters. This begs the question: in between the Prison and the University, is personhood something you have to prove? 


For students at MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institution, the journey to class is a taxing one. 

Much of students’ days—twenty hours if the prison is in lockdown—is spent in cells. When it’s time for class, they embark down a long gray “hallway of hopelessness,” according to Marcus Harvin, an alumnus of the YPEI (’23) and a current College-to-Career Fellow. He described how the trek is a double-edged sword—“a sign of hope for the inmate population but a sign of ridicule for the Corrections Officers.”

Indeed, despite supportive prisons from the YPEI’s administrative perspective, all five incarcerated students I spoke with described a degree of hostility from guards across prisons. Though some COs displayed interest in students’ coursework, many firmly espoused the belief that incarcerated people did not deserve an education, much less one from an institution like Yale. 

“Some will even be bold enough to say to each other when a group of students are coming by, ‘Oh, we got to pay X amount of dollars [for college], all they got to do is come to prison,’" says Harvin. “You got to get through a lot of hostility, to get to, let’s say for vernacular’s sake, History.”

History is held in a seminar room at the end of the hall. With a round table, chairs, and a window, it could resemble any classroom at Yale. But instead of lush courtyards and blue skies, students gaze out at the prison block, where other inmates walk to and from class. Harvin describes it as an “educational warehouse.”

Part of the violence of a prison is its mundanity, says Hector Rodriguez, an alumnus of the Bard Prison Initiative and a current College-to-Career Fellow at the YPEI.
“I will look into the yard and people go in circles like zombies,” he told me. “That's your routine for every day of the sentence. You're doing the same thing.”

For Herrera Soto, proposing assignments for Basic Drawing meant finding ways to fight this mundanity. He suggested that students use abstraction—rendering an image with scribbles. “It's great because it’s not really your bunk or the concrete hallway…but [still what] we're trying to learn, which is value,” he said.

The classroom itself, for many students, is a departure from the oppressive routine of the prison.
“You’re planning something and you're performing or you're writing and that brings you to another world,” says Elizabeth Hinton, a History professor at Yale and in the YPEI. “It's important to provide people—[where] the purpose of prison is to remind them where they are in the world—to be able to transcend that.”

James Jeter, an alumnus of the Wesleyan Center for Prison Education and the Founder of the Dwight Hall Civic Allyship Initiative, labels professors as “idealists,” facilitating a space where “for the first time…[students] get to actually have an experience outside of being an inmate.”
“It's like the best part of the day that anybody in such a situation could have,” says Harvin. “Because you don't only get educated. You get community, communication, camaraderie. And that's something that prison lacks because it's such an independent process…It's like a facade or dream, right? …But like, we can't really survive by ourselves.”

Cultivating this community of optimism is not without its challenges. For Paul North, Co-Faculty Director of the YPEI, teaching a class called Non-Cynical Socialists required an exercise in imagination. 
“We looked for a way to think about society that wasn't cynical,” North said. “What does it mean to look for utopian moments? And students are resistant at first.”

For their final projects, students were tasked with analyzing an intentional community in history. One decided to focus on Black Wall Street, a prosperous area in Tulsa, Oklahoma heralded by Black agriculturists in the early twentieth century. It was eventually the site of a devastating massacre. For their final projects, students resurrected the community, acting out a day on Black Wall Street. 

Hinton describes how in her African American Literature class, many students were able to name—for the first time—the structural forces of race, class, and gender that played a role in their imprisonment. 
“This is essentially the essence of the value of a liberal arts education,” says North, “liberating your mind.”

And yet, liberation in a prison setting is always limited. Eventually, class ends, and students, armed with the academic tools to interrogate their oppression, must still embark back down the “hallway of hopelessness.”
“Of course, it's cool to be on Instagram for the Governor. It's cool to be on Yale’s Instagram…But it sucks to have to go back to a cell after you learn all of this stuff,” says Harvin. “After you've just been told by one of the most brilliant people in your field that you are brilliant yourself. But you’re still behind bars.”

In a prison setting, where students tolerate harassment to go to class, Jeter says inmates must be wary of conflating studenthood with personhood. 
“You can't get roped into believing that something is worth more than your freedom,” says Jeter. “That this version of your humanity is worth more than your overall humanity. Nothing is worth more than your personhood.”


For many, college in prison isn’t just about education; it’s about the future it offers post-release.
“A lot of times, we're not really looking at recidivism as a metric of success in higher education. That's not important to us,” says Roland. “But to sell the program to the facilities, they want to know that higher education is impactful for recidivism, or that it's having these different metrics, which it does.”

At the Danbury location, Site Director Tracy Westmoreland mentions a new Ward who really “sees the value” in the program: “If the students are
