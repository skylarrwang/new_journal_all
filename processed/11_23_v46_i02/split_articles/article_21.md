On Sunday, October 22nd, more 
than one thousand from Yale, New 
Haven, and throughout Connecticut 
gathered on the New Haven Green to 
march around the Elm City in solidarity 
with Palestine. They protested the ongo­
ing bombing campaign in Gaza, which 
the UN has called “a graveyard for chil­
dren,” and that has left more than ten 
thousand dead, according to Palestinian 
health officials.

Whole 
families, 
students, 
and 
organisers marched for about three 
hours, chanting “Free Palestine” or 
“Not another nickel, not another dime, 
not another dollar for Israel’s crimes,” 
among other chants. People donned tra­
ditional keffiyehs and masked their faces 
out of concern for the spike in doxing 
of openly pro-Palestine people across 
workplaces and campuses nationwide. 
The rally was organised by American 
Muslims for Palestine Connecticut, 
Students for Justice in Palestine at 
UConn, and Yalies4Palestine.
