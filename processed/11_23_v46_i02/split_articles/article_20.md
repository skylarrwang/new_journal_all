EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
who organized with the Environmental 
Justice Coalition during her years as a 
student, told me that “vandalism just 
wasn’t at the top of our minds because 
we thought there were other things we 
could do that were based more on build­
ing community.” 

Another explanation is that incessant 
surveillance prevents property dam­
age. Police presence at Yale has evolved 
beyond bodies. Property itself can see, 
too, with cameras watching students 
everywhere at all times. As Adcock 
explains it, there are more eyes watching, 
with cameras at every corner, and more 
mechanisms for faceless expression. The 
internet now platforms countless anon­
ymous voices. He leans back in his chair, 
saying, “Anonymity is huge. It’s a lot 
easier for people to just open up a lap­
top, open up the phone, and, and put 
out what they want. It takes a lot more 
time, thought, and effort to put a mes­
sage out in writing.” The internet’s ano­
nymity grows even more attractive when 
one realizes that nearly every physical 
place is monitored, with skilled investi­
gators prepared to track down culprits. 
Vandalism has lost its anonymity, while 
the internet makes anonymous expres­
sion far easier than ever before. 

And even when students move 
to touch things without the intent to 
destroy, surveillance pounces on them. 
“Vandalism” has become a term Yale uses 
to antagonize disagreeable movements. 
The Native and Indigenous Student 
Association at Yale—Yale’s oldest and 
largest organization of Indigenous stu­
dents—held a vigil for Missing and 
Murdered Indigenous Women in 2022. 
Hands, stamped with easily-washable 
red Crayola paint, covered the walls 
of Cross Campus in memory of these 
missing women. The activists both com­
municated their actions to Yale Facilities 
and planned to clean after themselves. 
Administrators messaged the organizers 
to immediately remove all displays. They 
strove to, but risked frostbite. A few dis­
plays were left to be cleaned the next 
morning. Organizers found themselves 
subject to more hostility—cleaned walls 
and responsible names demanded by 
administrators.

Later in the year, a pterodactyl, 
taken from Indigenous land by Yale 
professor O.C. Marsh in the nineteenth 
century and immortalized in a glass 
display case, found its shelter covered 
in small red sticky notes which read 
“STOLEN.” These actions were eas­
ily removable forms of protest which 
did not significantly disrupt campus 
life. Sticky notes are sticky notes, easily 
removable and nondestructive, espe­
cially when on a glass display case. The 
Yale Police Department identified the 
Native student protesters by their shirts 
and IDs, calling them to declare their 
acts as vandalism. The accusation was, 
evidently, not about the method of pro­
test, which was harmless. It was about 
its agreeability with the institution, an 
institution that could so easily frame 
certain actions as vandalism. 

Today, the incidents of vandalism 
that leak into this campus appear to be 
done by outsiders. In the last decade, the 
only major reported instances of vandal­
ism have been three acts of antisemitic 
hate speech. In each case, the Yale Police 
successfully identified the responsible 
culprits—the identified culprits were 
juveniles outside of the Yale community. 
They happened in less visible places than 
the other acts of vandalism—a bath­
room stall, an entryway door, the Law 
School steps. But these acts were pos­
sible only to those outside of the Yale 
community, those unable to be tracked 
by shirts and IDs. They act without fear 
of an institution that they don’t have to 
answer to. 

It remains an open question as to 
when vandalism will return to cam­
pus in the activist vein it once existed. 
Security camera screens, with their 
timestamps ticking away, may be the 
first to let us know.∎
