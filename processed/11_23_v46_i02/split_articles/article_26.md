EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
A single red sclera scans linoleum.
It encloses the 
white irises that I bathe the milling men and
women and children in. They are scattered 
on the smooth floor.
I stare down 
rows neater than hangars
columns of dates and times, and flights
an endless array of white arriveds 
and red lates. 
I spit out the brisk walking 
businesswoman, the curly haired teenager,
the bearded man with a black mandala 
on his shirt. Their shells roll with them,
worn as their faces. Tiny heads crane
to look through my eastern gate—searching
for mothers weary, fathers hurried, siblings
with sound proof headphones and textbooks 
weighing their carry ons. A crumb-fingered child 
hops to his mom, and a sister hands her a damp bouquet. 
A woman cannot stop her wide, toothy smile 
directed at my open mouth.
I chew all who are missed, so their faces weary are
lit up red seeing the ones caring. I chose the boundary
between away and returned. I decide when their waiting 
comes to a halt. I watch over them in red, bold. 
Unnoticed. In the end, no one disobeys my 
command. In the end, none of the travelers
ever turn back.
