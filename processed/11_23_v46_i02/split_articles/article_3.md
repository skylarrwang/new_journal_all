EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The adminstration has also taken on an 
influencer role itself.  
“Day in the Life” reels are no lon­
ger restricted to influencers’ Instagrams; 
they are all over Yale’s admissions 
account. The image of Yale that influ­
encers portray becomes far more official 
in creating a specific perception of Yale 
when it is endorsed by Yale channels. 
Yale’s social media presence is filled 
with these student-made videos, with 
administrators encouraging students 
to toe the line between student and 
influencer. It seems a new frontier of 
advertising has opened up—one that 
relies on faux candid sixty second vid­
eos and maximizing online buzz.

Before I came here, Yale occupied 
an unattainable standard in my mind. 
Everyone was living a life that looked 
straight out of a movie, one that I just 
couldn’t seem to capture. Now I’ve come 
to love Yale much more. Instead of long­
ing for only the picture perfect, I revel in 
the tangible, quiet moments of reflection. 
I revel in the mundane.∎
