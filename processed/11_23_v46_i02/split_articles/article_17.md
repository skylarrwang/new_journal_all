EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
nurse-midwife and professor at Drexel University, 
has written about how early twentieth century 
physicians, nurses, and public health reformers, 
intent on building credibility for obstetrics and 
bringing births into the hospital, launched a calculated campaign to stamp out Black and immigrant midwives. Advocates began writing racist 
and xenophobic articles that framed midwives as 
backwards, ignorant, and dirty—one published in 
Harper’s Magazine in 1930 decried “rat-pie midwifery.” Such articles ignored statistics showing 
that births attended by Black and immigrant 
midwives in the nineteen-twenties and nineteenthirties had significantly lower death rates. 
By the nineteen-thirties, midwives only 
attended 15 percent of births in the United 
States. Now, almost a century later, midwives 
attend about 


12 percent of births in the U.S. This attendance 
is significantly lower than in countries like 
England where midwives deliver nearly half of 
all babies and maternal outcomes are much safer. 
Today, only 7 percent of midwives are Black. 
Hafeeza Ture, a mother of three from a 
multi-generational New Haven family, can trace 
this shift away from the home and into hospitals through her own lineage. Her grandmother’s 
generation was the first to give birth in a hospital. Both her grandmother and mother used formula instead of breastfeeding. After unsatisfying 
prenatal appointments with an OB-GYN, Ture 
decided to have her children at a freestanding 
birth center, and then at home, attended to by 
midwives and doulas. 
For Ture, returning to natural births felt 
like returning to a tradition that runs in her 
blood. She never had the opportunity to ask 
her great-grandmothers about her memories of 
childbirth, but she thinks about what they might 
have told her. 
“I wish I could have sat at their feet and asked 
them: what was this like, what was that like?” she 
said. “Do you recall your grandmother’s mother?”


On a Thursday evening in early 
October, 
Oni 
Muhammad 
takes a brief dinner break at 
home before heading back 
to Yale New Haven Hospital 
to complete her on-call midwifery shift. Her day started 
at 8 a.m. when she attended a 
C-section and saw a postpartum 
patient. She’s headed back to the 
hospital at 8 p.m. and will be there 
until 8 a.m. the next morning.
Muhammad will be on-call for a 
total of twenty-four hours. She will only get paid 
for eight. 
“We get paid more in karma, and less in cash,” 
she says. 
Muhammad is a certified nurse-midwife at 
Fair Haven Community Health Clinic, a federally recognized health center. Latine activists 
founded the clinic in the early nineteen-seventies, 
frustrated by the lack of accessible and culturally 
sensitive care for Fair Haven’s growing Latine 
community. Many patients live within walking 
distance of the center. Today, the majority of the 
clinic’s patients are either underinsured or uninsured, and over half of patients earn less than half 
of the federal poverty line. Since Connecticut 
expanded Medicaid coverage of prenatal and 
postpartum care available to undocumented 
immigrants last year, the clinic has seen more 
than a 20 percent increase in patients.
This increase means Muhammad and other 
midwives at the Fair Haven clinic are working in 
overdrive. Five full-time midwives at the clinic 
work to provide continuous care, from prenatal 
counseling to accompanying patients to hospitals like Yale New Haven Hospital for delivery. 
Muhammad estimates that she helps deliver 
fifteen to twenty births a month. Recently, the 
midwives renegotiated their contracts with Fair 
Haven Health Clinic to decrease their on-call 
hours to avoid burnout: instead of a monthly 
seventy-two hour on-call shift, the midwives 
will have a forty-eight hour shift every five weeks. 
For their weekly twenty-four hour on-call shifts, 
their salaries still only compensate one-third of 
their hours. 
“[Midwifery care] is not compensated because 
it’s not lucrative,” Muhammad says. “C-sections 
are much more lucrative from an insurance standpoint. On-call and vaginal births are just not 
where the money is at.”
Like midwives, doulas who want to serve 
low-income families struggle to make a living. 
With S.B. 986’s implementation still in process, doulas are not currently covered through 
Medicaid in the state of Connecticut, meaning 
that hiring a doula requires out-of-pocket 
money. Frasier charges $700 for 
“Birth Support,” which includes 
services like prenatal visits, 
constant accessibility over 
text, support during labor, 
breastfeeding help, and 
a postpartum visit. She 
charges $30 an hour for 
additional 
postpartum 
services, and $20 an hour 
for lactation consultation. 
Frasier tries to connect clients who cannot pay with 
programs that will cover the 
cost of her services. She often 
finds herself drastically reducing 
her fees so she can provide care for 
the underserved Black communities who 
motivated her to become a doula to begin with. 
Still, she wonders: how accessible is her care to a 
teenage mom, like the one she once was?
Frasier's dream is to quit her day job at Yale 
Dining and commit herself to being a full-time 
doula. Right now, the money is simply not there. 


Over the past thirty years, large healthcare 
corporations have engulfed Connecticut’s independent hospitals. The two largest, Hartford 
HealthCare and Yale New Haven Health System 
(YNHHS), own nearly half of the hospitals in 
the state. After consolidating, many hospitals 
cut services to cut costs, and labor and delivery is 
often one of the first to go. 
In 2007, Hartford HealthCare acquired 
Windham Hospital, which had been struggling 
financially. In 2020, the hospital closed its labor 
and delivery unit. After Nuvance Health acquired 
Sharon Hospital, the hospital filed for permission 
to terminate its birthing services in 2021.
A similar story has played out in the heart 
of downtown New Haven with Saint Raphael 
Hospital’s Vidone Birth Center. Founded in 1907 
as a small Catholic hospital, Saint Raphael was 
acquired by YNHHS in 2012. After Yale School 
of Nursing midwifery began its practice at St. 
Raphael’s the following year, the Vidone Birth 
Center developed a strong reputation as 
a midwife-centered, low-intervention birthing center. 
“We really built it to thrive 
on a midwifery-led model 
of care and had excellent 
outcomes,” said Michelle 
Telfer, a certified midwife 
and Assistant Professor in 
Midwifery and Women’s 
Health at the Yale School 
of Nursing who worked at 
Saint Raphael. “We were 
drawing patients from all 
over the state.” 
The midwifery model practiced by Telfer and other midwives 
at Saint Raphael focused on helping 
patients give birth as naturally as possible. Midwives avoided social inductions—early 
labor inductions performed for patient or provider convenience rather than medical necessity. 
In 2014, Saint Raphael established the Vidone 
Volunteer Doulas program which provided 
on-call doulas to support people during labor, 
opening access beyond patients who hired a 
doula privately. In 2015, 20 percent of births at 
Saint Raphael were C-sections—well under the 
state average of 34 percent. 
In the spring of 2020, YNHHS closed the 
Vidone birth center at Saint Raphael. Citing 
concerns about COVID-19 transmission and an 
inability to operate two obstetric units during 
the pandemic, YNHHS consolidated the Saint 
Raphael unit with the maternity ward at Yale 
New Haven Hospital. The two units merged in 
less than two weeks. Though YNHHS initially 
intended for the consolidation to be temporary, 
the Vidone Birth Center never reopened.
The obstetrical unit at Yale New Haven 
Hospital is now the largest in the state. According 
to Cynthia Sparer, executive director of Yale New 
Haven Children’s Hospital, the decision to permanently merge the two delivery units was made 
in order to centralize care and provide better 
services to both low and high-risk patients. Yet 
Telfer, Muhammad, Westbrook, and Frasier—
along with three other midwives and doulas 
with experience delivering at Yale New Haven 
Hospital—shared that since the consolidation, 
Saint Raphael’s original midwifery-led, low-intervention model has dissolved. Providers and 
patients pointed to three central issues: a hospital 
layout that limits communication between nurses 
and residents; burnout and high rates of turnover 
among staff; and a pressure to speed up births, 
sometimes due to inadequate bed capacity. 
At Saint Raphael’s Vidone birth center, one 
hallway housed six labor beds, the nurses’ station, 
and the provider call room. “I feel like it made for 
safer outcomes, just because we can see each other 
easier in a small environment,” said Muhammad, 
who has worked at both Saint Raphael and Yale 
New Haven Hospital. 
Now, 
at 
Yale 
New 
Haven 
Hospital, nurses, residents, and 
private 
practitioners 
occupy 
physically separate rooms, and 
there is no room large enough 
for nurses, residents, and 
midwives to review patient 
records together. This distance forces communication 
over text from siloed sections 
of the labor unit instead of 
face-to-face discussion. Telfer 
expressed concern over this 
dependence on digital problem-solving. “I think a lot gets lost,” 
she said. “When you have less collaboration you have less communication, and not 
as good outcomes for patients.”
Telfer sees this physical isolation as a remnant of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the 
hospital intentionally limited contact between 
different providers. But even now, the separated 
sectors of the labor unit continue to hinder 
communication efforts. 
“Structurally, you don’t see people. You 
don’t have that visual contact with people,” said 
Heather Reynolds, lecturer in the Nurse-Midwife 
Specialty program at Yale School of Nursing. 
Though 
Hospital 
increased its bed capacity during renovations 
in 2018, the hospital still sent a few overflow 
patients to Saint Raphael each year before the 
Vidone Birth Center closed. Since the consolidation, no new labor beds have been added 
to the hospital, meaning capacity across Yale 
and Saint Raphael is down six beds. Patients 
sometimes labor in triage because there is no 
labor bed available. While the triage beds are 
designed to “flex” into labor beds, Telfer and 
Muhammad said that the triage beds are not 
ideal for labor—there is no room for more 
than one support person, and laboring patients 
must walk through triage to use the toilet. 
Additionally, triage beds do not accommodate 
different birthing positions. 
Both Telfer and Muhammad said that the 
shortage of labor beds can create pressure to perform C-sections. Telfer said nurses have asked 
her to intervene to speed up births, because 
there's no time for a physiologic birth if other 
patients are waiting for a bed. 
“Turnover has been
dramatic,” Telfer said. 
“I barely know any of the 
nurses there. A lot of the 
ones who have been there for 
many years have left to do other 
things—they are very unhappy 
with the pressure and the lack 
of safety at times of having to 
care for too many people 
at once.”
