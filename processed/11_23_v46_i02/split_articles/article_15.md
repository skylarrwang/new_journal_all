In the end, curly seems like a fair 
middle—it’s not the wavy hair salon 
or the tight curl salon. She adds a final 
word: “if you have curls of any kind, 
we’re the place.”


Sharon Joy Salon and Trachouse 
both grapple with the material lim­
itations of the natural hair movement. 
People like my mom, who cut out relax­
ers and went natural, found that empow­
erment and hair “health” were no match 
for hair loss, whether due to chemother­
apy, alopecia, or any other host of factors. 
How can you go natural when your hair 
simply won’t grow?


At Sharon Joy Salon, I talk to styl­
ist Ranada Morrison. She’s currently in 
school to become a licensed trichologist, 
someone who studies diseases or prob­
lems related to the hair and scalp.
“After the pandemic, when we came 
back into the salon, I noticed that a lot 
of clients were suffering from hair loss,” 
Ranada tells me as she presses a client’s 
hair. She felt a responsibility to help them, 
but because it wasn’t something taught in 
cosmetology school, she enrolled in the 
Institute of Trichology Studies online. 
Though she’s not fully done with her 
trichologist certification, she shows me 
a before and after photo of a client she’s 
helped. “She’s been suffering from alo­
pecia for ten years,” she explained, “and I 
was able to help her in a few weeks.” 
Renee 
Brown, 
the 
owner 
of 
Trachouse, specializes in hair loss 
through another medium: wigs. Every 
October, Trachouse hosts what they 
call the “Pink Project,” a day where 
breast cancer survivors will receive a 
makeup application, wig installation, 
and photoshoot with food and gifts, all 
provided for by the salon and its donors. 
Wigs, which may seem at odds 
with the natural hair movement, can 
be understood as an extension of one 
of its central goals: choice. Both Sharon 
Joy Salon and Trachouse are looking 
for new ways to help their clients when 
those choices are limited. 


My mom tried wigs, too, but decided 
they weren’t for her. 
After the second round of chemo, 
her hair began to fall out. One night, we 
sat side-by-side on the couch, watch­
ing TV, when I noticed a clump of hair 
subtly distended from her scalp. It was 
in the process of falling.
For a moment, I forgot there was an 
obvious cause and asked “what’s that?” 
As my mom pulled that piece 
out, the hair offering no resistance, we 
couldn’t help but remember. She was 
calm; I pretended to be. I’d done my 
mom’s hair before—I liked to do hair, 
and it saved money. My mom wasn’t too 
particular about those things. I’d cut her 
bangs, styled it when it was curly and 
natural, and given her twist outs.
I sprang into action. I told her I’d 
give her a short haircut, cute yet mod­
ern, like ones she’d had before. I got the 
scissors and a comb and carried a dining 
room chair into the living room for her 
to sit. 
I had to comb to cut, but as I 
combed, the hair kept coming. It was 
unexpected. I didn’t imagine she’d lose 
this much, this soon. I was trying to stop 
the bleed.
We went upstairs to wash her hair 
in the tub. She sat, kneeling over the 
tub, her head under the faucet—the 
way I had so many times before—and 
I kneeled behind her, the same way she 
would. I lathered shampoo in her hair 
and scrubbed, and the hair kept falling. 
Now, the water bound it to my hands. 
How was there so little when there 
had been so much? 
I wasn’t able to be strong anymore, 
to keep up the problem-solving noncha­
lant charade, even for her. Was I stand­
ing or sitting when the tears came? It’s 
all awash. Even though it was her hair 
and her battle, it was my mom who held 
me in that moment, and told me that it 
was okay. That it was “just hair.”    


In the world of Black hair, it can 
feel impossible to extricate oneself from 
a painful past of denigration and dehu­
manization. Efforts to empower women 
and Black people—to uphold the right 
to choose what to do with your hair—
are complicated by the implication each 
style carries. 


As Monique sits under the dryer, 
her curly hair cutting session almost 
complete, a teenage boy walks into the 
salon, still dressed in his school uniform. 
When he expresses doubt that he’s in the 
right place, I remember what Susie said 
about trauma that she and other curly 
girls experience, and I think about the 
boys, too, about everyone. A member of 
the The Curly Hair Salon team assures 
him that he’s arrived. He admits he has 
never had a curly cut or styling before. 
Soon, he’s grinning as the hairdresser 
shapes and defines his fro.


The Curly Hair Salon, like those 
around it, exists as a contradiction, inter­
vention, remembrance, and stagnation 
at once. The ever-growing salon indus­
try in New Haven suggests that there 
is something complementary about 
these contradictions, something inher­
ent about them to these practices. Or it 
suggests, as Renee said, that “people will 
always want to get cute.”∎
