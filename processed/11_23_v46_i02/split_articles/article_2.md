Points of Departure
Across the Board
At first, I thought I was on the wrong 
floor of the library. I had just gotten off 
a phone call with my parents. Their sur­
prise at the existence of a Go Club in 
New Haven heightened my excitement 
to uncover its existence for myself. I had 
anticipated wooden Go tables sprawled 
out across an open floor in a small, 
closed-off section of the library. My par­
ents teased that I would be out of place. 
Baduk—the Korean name for Go—is an 
old person’s game.

Perhaps there would be rice crackers 
and dried squid, and I would have to be 
prepared to introduce myself in Korean. 
I was worried the elders might find my 
questions bothersome; the church elders 
I knew weren’t always fond of gameplay 
interruptions. But the prospect of meet­
ing Korean American elders in New 
Haven excited me nonetheless. 

The Korean American Students at 
Yale newsletter introduced me to the 
New Haven Go Club. Hearing about 
the club prompted me to trace back 
the spaces I associate with Go. In cele­
bration of Lunar New Year, the Korean 
American church in my hometown 
transforms its cafeteria into a hall brim­
ming with Korean dishes and snacks, 
church members wearing hanboks, and a 
large spread of traditional games. Lining 
one side of the cafeteria, pairs of Korean 
elders play long, silent matches of Baduk 
against the backdrop of lively festivities. 

A similar sight awaits at the Korean 
sauna: in the recreational area, next to 
the chess boards, are Baduk boards with 
small bowls of black and white stones 
placed neatly next to them.

For me, Baduk is an emblem of the 
diasporic Asian community, finding its 
way into churches on Long Island, sau­
nas in New Jersey, and libraries in New 
Haven. It embodies the post-colonial, 
diasporic Korean experience in its very 
essence: a strategy game of conquest 
and capture, sacrifice and liberty, life 
and death.

As I descended the New Haven Free 
Public Library stairs, I saw no elders or 
young Korean students. It was all white 
people. But the Go boards—with their 
sure grids and black and white stones—
were unmistakable. Four people hunched 
around a long white folding table. And 
Quentin Bateux-Mocquard was one of 
them, just about to start his first match.

Bateux-Mocquard, the club founder 
and a postdoctoral researcher at Yale, 
enjoys abstract games and logic: a reflec­
tion of his background in computer 
science. He first heard of Go as a boy 
through Hikaru no Go, a manga about 
a boy possessed by a Go player from 
Japan’s Heian period. But it wasn’t until 
2015, when AlphaGo became the first 
Go computer program to defeat a pro­
fessional player, that Bateux-Mocquard 
revisited Go as an adult. That technolog­
ical feat intrigued Bateux-Mocquard. He 
began playing Go through local clubs 
across France. 

Bateux-Mocquard, with a smiley 
demeanor and an eagerness to teach, 
walked me through my first game of Go. 
I had never played before and found it 
funny that a white man in New Haven 
was the first one to teach me. I don’t have 
a talent for abstract strategy games and 
struggled to foresee obvious formations 
and predict Bateux-Mocquard’s moves. 
But Bateux-Mocquard is especially sea­
soned in teaching total beginners. He 
taught me all the basic components and 
strategies. The term “Atari,” for exam­
ple, refers to when a stone or a group 
of stones can be captured on the next 
move by the opponent—similar to a 
check in chess. I found myself in Atari 
quite frequently. 

Next to us sat John Grisafi. He was 
more soft-spoken than Bateux-Mocquard
but sometimes looked up from his own 
game to chime in with advice on cleaner 
ways to play. Grisafi is a fifth-year gradu­
ate student at Yale with a focus in Asian 
religions and has previously researched 
U.S. military occupations in South Korea. 
His research, as well his marriage to a 
Korean person, drove him to explore 
Korean hobbies. “I was exposed to the 
game after initially being exposed to 
Janggi,” he says as he deliberates his next 
move, talking through his turn. Janggi 
is a chess variant played in Korea on a 9 
inch by 10 inch gameboard. Grisafi owns a 
board with Janggi layouts on one side and 
Go on the other. After a year and a half 
of playing the Janggi board, he decided to 
flip it over and try the Go side. 

Grisafi has helped Bateux-Mocquard 
advertise the club by reaching out to Yale 
student organizations like the Ancient 
Chinese Traditions Club. Both men are 
committed to growing the club for the 
same reason: personal connection. 

Bateux-Mocquard’s motivation for 
starting the club in March of this year 
grew out of a frustration with the lack 
of connection in playing Go online. “I 
need the balance of being able to actually 
see people and play and chat and play 
against a lot of different levels, and teach 
sometimes.” He adds that seeing people 
face-to-face motivates him.

Grisafi, who started playing through 
apps, also acknowledges the merit of 
playing in-person: “I was in Daegu, 
Korea, and I was at a park and saw older 
men playing. It’s seeing people play it in 
person that really rekindles your interest 
in doing so.” 

Halfway into the club meeting, 
Justin Kim arrived, a newcomer to the 
Go club and a Korean American grad­
uate student at Yale. He was the only 
other Asian person in attendance and 
had joined in interest of playing in per­
son. Kim, who grew up playing with his 
brother, says, “It makes it much more 
human…it’s nice to talk to someone and 
chat before and after or just have small 
talk during it.” 

Kim adds that there is an added layer 
of excitement that comes with play­
ing against real people—it heightens 
the stakes. He recalls his experiences of 
playing against chess hustlers in New 
York City, where putting money down 
made him even more exhilarated to play. 
Similarly, the dynamic of a Go game 
transforms when your opponent is sit­
ting right in front of you, even with no 
money involved. 

Teaching, watching, and chatting 
comprised the ethos of the members’ 
interactions at the club meeting. Before 
a game, members would negotiate how 
to even the playing field, often play­
ing someone with more or less expe­
rience. At the end of a game, players 
would deliberate moves they should’ve 
taken and exchange analyses of the 
other’s game. Throughout the games, 
members also shared anime recommen­
dations and bonded over their love for 
Californian cities. For a club I expected 
to be a silent, meditative escape from the 
rainy weather, the session was brimming 
with jokes—the club was asked to quiet 
down three times by library personnel. 
By the end of the session, all three of 
the remaining members huddled around 
Kim and Bateux-Mocquard’s game, 
watching intently and offering lively 
commentary.  

I did not leave the club meeting 
any better at Baduk than I did walking 
in. The terms, ironically, still feel foreign 
to me—atari, liberties, ladders. I cannot 
inherit Baduk: my parents and cousins 
in America do not play, and the ones 
that might live fifteen hours away. And 
yet I can walk five minutes to the New 
Haven Free Public Library, where a 
small piece of this uninherited culture 
is nestled tightly into a community that 
handles it with care.∎

Unsubscribing
F
rom my home in Mumbai, I 
devoured all of Aimee Catherine’s 
vlogs. “LIVING LIKE RORY GILMORE FOR 
A DAY AT YALE UNIVERSITY.” “Harvard-
Yale Game 2021 | ‘The Game’ Vlog.” 
“college weekend in my life at yale.”

Each left me in awe of the life she 
leads at Yale, and more excited to come 
here in the fall.

Now Catherine ’25 sits in front of me 
in the Morse common room. She’s taller 
than I expected, a wonderful listener, 
and refreshingly down-to-earth. The 
Yale junior also has more than twenty 
thousand subscribers on YouTube, a sig­
nificant share of which are high school 
girls. I look at her with a mix of awe and 
anticipation, incredulous to be talking to 
the same person whose weekly videos I 
once watched religiously.

She'd sketched out Yale with the 
tools I would need to succeed here. I 
thought I knew Yale; I thought I knew 
her—it turns out, I know neither.

“I center my content around my life­
style, a big part of which is Yale,” she 
tells me. “It’s a way for me to channel 
my creativity and document my experi­
ences, and was never meant to be a gen­
eralization of what Yale is for everyone.”

I logically know that Catherine and 
campus influencers are not complicit in 
the discrepancy between the content 
they produce and the resulting image 
they create for their followers. And yet, 
I can’t help but feel deceived.

Until I arrived at Yale this August, 
I was one of those many followers, con­
vinced that life at Yale was as perfect 
as it looked online, with the First-Year 
Dinner and East Rock hikes and picnics 
on a beautiful fall day that influencers 
advertised. It didn’t take long for the 
rosy camera lens to fog.

I grew up in Mumbai—coming to 
Yale meant not only a transition from 
high school to college but also a fun­
damental cultural adjustment. For the 
first time, I found myself in several 
situations where I was the only brown 
person in the room—some references 
went over my head, and my accent 
often felt uncomfortably distinct. Never 
before had my Indian identity felt so 
pronounced, as I fielded questions like 
“How on Earth is your English so good?” 
and “If you’re from India, how did you 
get into Yale?” 

I am not alone in this isolation. 
Fellow international students echo sim­
ilar struggles—the lack of our represen­
tation on social media, the differences 
between the one-size-fits-all Yale expe­
rience and the one we have.

“We see glimpses of what it’s like to 
be at Yale,” my friend and fellow first-
year Mansi Anil Kumar ’27 told me, 
“but never what it’s like to be at Yale as 
an international student.” Indian stu­
dents at Yale like Mansi have become 
my makeshift home and family, people 
that I cannot imagine my life here with­
out. The hashtags and TikToks never 
talk about the intense homesickness 
and loneliness that several of us have 
experienced given the huge transition 
we are making. 

It can feel difficult to move beyond 
the constructed image of Yale online to 
a real one—one beyond the myth. 

Some of my happiest moments have 
been in the last few months. My intel­
lectual curiosity has never felt as nur­
tured, my friends are some of the most 
wonderful people I have had the privi­
lege of meeting, and I have truly started 
to feel at home here. But, this semester 
has also been rife with moments of self-
doubt and imposter syndrome, with 
the constant doubt of whether I truly 
deserve to be here. 

Curious about the image Yale influ­
encers seek to present, I also talked to 
Emme Zhou ’23, an influencer known 
for her Yale dining hall content. Her 
“come get a meal with me at Yale!” 
TikToks went viral, accumulating mil­
lions of views. I remember obsessively 
rewatching her videos and salivating 
over apple pancake brunches. Talking 
to her was surreal. She was the same 
Emme who was my primary source of 
information about Yale dining halls, 
the same Emme whose food content 
has made all my friends at other univer­
sities bitterly jealous. 

“I wasn’t providing thoughts and 
opinions on the Yale experience, I was 
just showcasing what we have,” Zhou 
told me. Living in Pauli Murray, her 
“daily breakfast was delicious,” and she 
aimed to let her viewers draw their own 
conclusions about life at Yale. Of course, 
Zhou did not advertise that she was an 
employee of Yale Hospitality as a stu­
dent worker—even if she told me that 
payment did not impact her content. 

While talking to her, I realize that 
this disparity between the “Yale” that 
influencers portray and the “Yale” we 
imagine is an unintended consequence 
of being an influencer at Yale. But, to 
be perfectly honest, she did set the bar 
high with her cannoli pancake-filled 
montages—a bar that my daily salad 
and hummus could never dream of liv­
ing up to. 

Both Catherine and Zhou seemed 
careful not to generalize the Yale expe­
rience to everyone. But, their wide 
reach—particularly when Catherine’s 
viewer demographics consist mostly of 
high schoolers—means that there is a 
fine line between “showcasing” a Yale 
experience and having that become the 
standard for future Yalies. 

These influencers are situated in a 
much broader network of Yale’s care­
fully curated online presence. Their 
work begs the question: Who should be 
held accountable for crafting the ideal­
ized myth of Yale?

Perhaps more pervasive—if sub­
tle—is the Yale Admissions Office and 
other Yale administrative presences 
online. I remember coming across an 
admissions blog titled “What are Yale 
Youtubers,” which publicized a Harvard-
Yale game day vlog, Catherine’s “FIRST 
DAY OF COLLEGE AT YALE UNIVERSITY | 
Freshman Year!” video, among several 
other influencers’ YouTube channels.
