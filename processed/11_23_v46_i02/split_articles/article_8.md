company, and to teach as a professor in 
universities across the Northeast. Alper, 
though still passionate about music, realized that she is more skilled as a developmental psychologist. Marguiles went 
to law school and practices law to this 
day, her activist spirit strong as ever. 
McClure kept at her musical dreams. 
She became the first woman to graduate 
with a master’s degree in saxophone performance from the Manhattan School 
of Music. After juggling jobs as a music 
teacher at five different New York City 
schools, she founded the Kit McClure 
Band, an all-female jazz band that went 
on to play sold-out venues throughout 
the Northeast United States, Europe, and 
Japan. She is 72 and resides in Manhattan 
with her husband of eighteen years. 


Only Blaisdell and Abod hoped to 
continue playing, so they put out advertisements in Ms. and Sister to find new 
members for a more musical and less 
political band. “The new band sounded 
immensely better than the old one,” 
Blaisdell wrote. “But there were problems.” By 1976, because the women’s 
movement was holding fewer conferences and events, the Band struggled to 
find gigs and eventually dissolved. 


While the heart of the Band lingers 
with the members, they’ve since found 
their own paths. Abod went on to anchor 
The Jennifer Abod Show, the first nightly 
AM radio program with a female host, 
to found a feminist-centered production 
Blaisdell remained in New Haven, 
working at the New Haven Independent 
and serving on the editorial board for 
Sister. To her, the shortness of the Band’s 
tenure meant that they were unable to 
accomplish their mission of radicalizing rock music. The end of the women’s 
movement marked an end to the Band. 
“We blew it,” Blaisdell wrote. “Without a 
movement, an assault against the cultural 
forms of our society will fail.” 


But hope glowed through Blaisdell’s 
disappointment—even as they disbanded,

something greater had been set in motion. 
Abod said, “We had a right to do this, and 
it might not have come out as well as we 
wanted. The people after us will do it better, but we had to do it for the first time.” 


While the band has not performed 
publicly in almost fifty years, its legacy 
carries on within Connecticut’s music 
scene and within Yale. East Rock House 
celebrates and spotlights queer and 
trans musicians by hosting events like 
the Trans 4 Trans music festival. Space 
Ballroom fosters an inclusive space dedicated to musical freedom and personal 
expression. Tarek, the lead singer of the 
hardcore punk band Intercourse, said 
that Connecticut treasures a prominent 
experimental punk scene that counters 
traditional exclusive and masculine rock. 


Today, Blaisdell is 83 and lives 
with her partner, historian and professor Amy Kesselman. Her home—and 
its bookshelves stocked from floor to 
ceiling, a room dedicated to her drum 
set and dozens of her used cameras, 
and a refrigerator covered in political 
magnets––still bursts with her youthful dynamism. 


“There wouldn’t be women [at Yale] 
today if people hadn’t pushed the crap 
out of it,” Blaisdell said. Her Band’s radical humanitarian and utopic vision still 
lingers in New Haven today. ∎
