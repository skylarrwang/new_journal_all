The boy comes in at ten to sit again. 
He is a model for Hermes. The sculptress 
wears safety glasses and earmuffs and 
her bootprints leave neat trails across 
her studio floor. She climbs a ladder 
and works on a big white face. In every 
direction: marble torsos, marble heads, 
marble all over. 
The boy watches. Three times this 
week he has woken in the sculptress’s 
bed and opened his eyes to the light of 
an unfamiliar window. The sculptress 
looks down at him, looks back at her 
work. Chink chink chink, says her 
chisel. Chink chink chink, chink chink 
chink. She tells the boy he is perfect 
for her project. The boy sits and smirks. 
He smirks because he is in love, and 
the sculptress, from atop her ladder, 
says his smirk is what she likes most 
about him. His smirk is just right for 
Hermes, god of thieves, god of speed 
and distant messages. 
But the smirk is not right. The boy is 
no god. The sculptress does not tell the 
boy, but when she chisels away at the nose, 
when she carves the fullness of the lower 
lip, she does not think of the boy’s nose 
and lip but of the nose and lip of a man 
she would like to make exist. Because with 
each stroke of the hammer, the sculptress 
thinks of the boy mispronouncing 
synecdoche; thinks of how his swaggered 
walk is clearly forced; thinks of that 
terribly embarrassing way he pouts when 
she is unimpressed by his poetry. The boy 
is no god. Here’s Hermes: curly-haired, 
marble, seven feet tall. The boy is not 
marble or seven feet tall. 
The sculptress wipes the back of 
a glove across her brow. She studies 
the face of the god she has made, and 
Hermes glows with something like 
gratitude. “He’s finished,” the sculptress 
says. “How do you know?” asks the 
boy. She says she just knows. One 
gets a feel for these things. But there’s 
more to it than that, of course. Hermes 
is finished, and she knows he is 
finished because all his imperfections 
are on the floor. The sculptress, for 
all her accolades, has just two skills: she 
locates something she doesn’t like—
and then she destroys it.
