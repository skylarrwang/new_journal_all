“H
ow’s mom?” one stylist asks as she 
settles her client into the chair, 
draping a black smock over her. The styl­
ist invokes a collective mother, not your 
mom or my mom, but a mom where the 
our is silent. 
The air is misty with the blow dryers’ 
smoky clouds. It smells like fruits and oils, 
like suds and sheen. 
I am visiting The Curly Hair Salon 
for my friend Monique’s biannual “curly 
cut.” As Susie Baez washes Monique’s 
hair, I sit in the empty seat beside them. 
Susie says that the salon’s location in Fair 
Haven, within the smells and rhythms 
of New Haven’s little Puerto Rico, feels 
like home. 

In the way that stories so often told 
become a memory, I somehow remem­
ber sitting propped in a portable car 
seat opposite my mom in her salon 
chair. It’s a story only a mother could 
tell: me, well-behaved, observant for 
about an hour until I wanted out, with 
all the women in the salon fighting over 
who could hold me. This was when we 
lived in Baltimore. The salon was around 
the corner from us, on University Place, 
when my mom still relaxed her hair, 
before that became a sort of sin. 
In The Curly Hair Salon, you will 
find nary a flat iron or curling iron—
G-d forbid any relaxers or texturizers, 
chemical treatments meant to smooth 
or straighten textured hair. Instead, the 
salon offers curly cuts, curly training, 
and curly styling, as well as color and 
various hair-health treatments like deep 
conditioners and protein treatments. 
The salon, open since 2011, sustains 
itself with a steady stream of regulars 
and first-timers. It is a new type of 
salon, part of a movement that elevates 
natural hair as a means to self-love and 
empowerment. 
Susie says her job is “healing.” Curly 
girls have trauma, she laments, whether 
with their hair or from the salon. Every 
year, from about the ages of 5 to 8, I 
asked to get my hair done for my birth­
day. No matter how many products my 
mom brought for the Hair Cuttery hair­
dresser to use, my haircut looked like 
a one-dimensional poof. But the fol­
lowing year, I’d ask to go back—even if 
the hairstylist pulled my hair while she 
detangled it and I was too shy to talk 
with her like my mom talked with her 
hairstylist Linda. I was happy to sit in 
the salon, to walk from the bowl to the 
chair with a smock around my neck, the 
droplets from my hair pattering against 
it—to feel, in that moment, a little more 
like my mom, like a woman. 
Hair trauma can take many forms. 
For some children, it might look like 
bullying or familial othering. For others, 
it might stem from a mom or dad that 
doesn’t know what to do with their hair, 
leading them to get relaxers at an early 
age, inflicting permanent damage. And 
when your hair won’t fit under a swim 
cap or can’t be done in the style you 
wanted for prom, you receive the mes­
sage early on that your hair is abnormal, 
unwanted, difficult. You start to think 
the only path to beauty is to manipu­
late the hair that naturally grows out of 
your head. 
So for Susie, one of the most 
rewarding aspects of her job is when a 
client tells her, “Susie, that trick you 
gave me saved my life.” 
In my seat next to Susie, light spurts 
of water leap out of the bowl, splashing 
me. With my hair in braids and not flat 
ironed (straight), I’m not worried about 
it getting wet. Today I let myself enjoy 
the odd sprinkler, as Susie tells me about 
her own hair trauma. Growing up in 
predominantly white neighborhoods 
and schools, she mostly straightened and 
relaxed her hair. In cosmetology school, 
she finally stopped. With the expertise 
of a hairdresser in training, Susie felt 
more confident than ever before in her 
ability to finally “figure out” her hair. 
Still, cosmetology school offered 
Suzie practically no training for curly 
hair. She turned to natural hair influenc­
ers on Instagram and YouTube, whose 
videos she watched almost religious­
ly—“like everyone else.” Important to 
Susie’s increased confidence was a place 
to learn from people like her, people 
with natural hair too.
Luvena, the salon’s owner, disclosed 
that the biggest secret to her hiring 
method is prayer, asking G-d to send 
her who she needs. 
“I can teach you how to do hair,” 
Luvena explains, “but I can’t teach you 
to be kind, to care about people.”
The Curly Hair Salon is one of the 
three salons I visited in the Greater 
New Haven area. For generations, New 
Haven has sustained the tradition of 
the Black salon as a way of maintain­
ing and uplifting the community amid 
urban trends like disinvestment, police 
violence, crime, and poverty. Hair salons 
are forced to reckon with the world—
its prejudices, changes, and joys—both 
within the confines of the salon floor 
and in the neighborhood beyond it. 

B
lack hair styling has a long his­
tory, often tied up in expression, 
rebellion, and belonging. 
The divide between natural and 
manipulated hair in the U.S. has its roots 
in chattel slavery, scholar Chanté Griffin 
writes, with enslaved women working 
in the fields covering their natural hair. 
Those working in plantation homes, 
though, sometimes styled their hair to 
mimic their enslavers, wearing wigs or 
manipulating their natural hair. In the 
era following emancipation, hair styl­
ing became a way to promote the Black 
respectability that leaders like DuBois 
and Washington espoused. Madam 
C.J. Walker, the first female African 
American millionaire, popularized a 
straightening comb and invented hair 
care products meant to “tame” Black hair. 
The Civil Rights Movement and 
Black radical politics of the twentieth 
century brought with them a new push 
for natural hair. Popular leaders along­
side celebrities—from Angela Davis 
to Michael Jackson—sported afros. As 
Marcus Garvey said, “Do not remove 
the kinks from your hair, remove them 
from your brain.” Natural hair in the 
nineteen-sixties and nineteen-seventies 
was a political statement, or as Griffin 
writes, a “sign of Black power and rebel­
lion against white American beauty 
standards.”
In the nineteen-eighties and nine­
teen-nineties, assimilation came back 
to the forefront. Hair care ads mar­
keted permed and pressed hair to Black 
women yet again. Still, images of popu­
lar celebrities like Janet Jackson wearing 
braids or cornrows proliferated.
In the late two-thousands and early 
two-thousand-tens, the national imagi­
nation seemed to be captivated to some 
extent with Black hair, particularly in its 
natural form. Popular films like Chris 
Rock’s Good Hair and Regina Kimbell’s 
My Nappy Roots: A Journey Through 
Black Hair-itage appeared on screens at 
the same time bloggers like Naptural85, 
Blackonyx77, and Patrice Yursik sur­
faced on people’s social media feeds. 
Videos like “My Natural Hair Routine,” 
“How to Get the Perfect Twistout,” and 
“The Best Deep Conditioners, Ranked” 
showed Black women talking about, 
styling, and experimenting with their 
natural hair. Soon, what had been a rel­
atively invisible phenomenon became a 
sensation. YouTube, in a way, became a 
new type of salon, and YouTubers, a new 
type of hairstylist. 
Beyond mere social media engage­
ment, the natural hair movement rap­
idly turned into a booming industry. 
Before, hair care aisles at major stores 
were dominated by mainstream brands 
like Pantene or Garnier. One of the only 
Black hair brands available was Dark 
& Lovely, famous for at-home perm 
kits. Brands like SheaMoisture, Carol’s 
Daughter, and Miss Jessie’s have since 
entered the market in quick succession. 
Now, natural hair products are at the 
helm of a burgeoning hair and beauty 
industry catered to women of color. 
Whereas chemical relaxers accounted 
for 60 percent of the textured hair cat­
egory in 2009, as of 2020, 60 percent of 
this market, which has topped one bil­
lion dollars in revenue, belongs to prod­
ucts marketed towards the specific needs
