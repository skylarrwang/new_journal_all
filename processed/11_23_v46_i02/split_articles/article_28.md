I've lived here for two months 
already, and it’s clear this space does not 
allow for another. I am left holding frag­
ments of two homes in my bare hands. 
Norfolk has discolored from memory; 
New Haven has not materialized. I stop 
myself from waving hello to old friends 
on Cross Campus. They do not exist here. 
My dorm is decorated like my childhood 
bedroom—it is familiar but not the same. 
I swipe my card for a vanilla chai 
and a tattered paperback. Book Trader 
Cafe unites worlds: vintage and new, 
books and coffee, students and locals. 
Here, there is motion and stillness. 
Baristas bustle about, people stop to flip 
through a book then run out with a cup 
in hand. Stacks and shelves of novels are 
indomitable as they loom over me, but 
if I take one out the rest falls to a slant. 
Everything is a counterbalance; every­
thing exists in harmony. 
Each book is a living archive 
that would have been forgotten if not 
recorded; the pages are yellowed but their 
contents remain. Time sharpens their 
stories and they endure discoloration. 
Running my fingers along cracked, well-
loved spines, I think home has come into 
focus for me now. Though discrete, the 
two cities can coexist. My past and pres­
ent are reconciled.
