“W
e’ve got to control our 
own lives,” Jennifer Abod sings. 
Her voice, sharp and convincing, cre­
scendos. “Free our sisters! Abortion 
is a right!” 
Virginia Blaisdell delivers the 
final riff on her French horn. Judy 
Miller strikes the last note on her 
cymbal and smiles. Rika Alper cracks 
a joke and tunes her guitar. Kit 
McClure distributes papers with the 
lyrics to the next song. “Sing along!” 
Leah Margulies shouts. Their audi­
ence of women, standing shoulder to 
shoulder, roars. 
It’s midnight on Wednesday in 
the summer of 1970. At Yale’s Delta 
Kappa Epsilon fraternity house, stu­
dents experience something like never 
before—the debut of the New Haven 
Women’s Liberation Rock Band. 
Six months before this performance, 
the soon-to-be bandmates had met at 
the Free Women’s Conference, a two-day 
event consisting of feminist speeches 
and discussions in which over three 
hundred women participated. The event 
sought to recruit new activists for the 
New Haven women’s movement, a 
group that emerged in 1966 out of 
frustration with the male-dominated 
American Independence Movement. 
Both the Conference and the Band 
underpinned 
the 
second-wave 
feminism movement, a period of 
advocacy for women’s equality and 
visibility—primarily for the wealthy 
and white.
Among them was Kit McClure 
’75, a first-year in Yale College’s first 
co-educational class in 1969 and 
the sole female member of the Yale 
Precision Marching Band in 1970. 
But after a male student forcibly 
picked her up and carried her across 
a football field, she quit. She’d also 
left the Directed Studies program, 
frustrated by the male students who 
talked over her in class. 
In 1970, Rika Alper was invited 
to the Free Women’s Conference to 
speak about the feminist struggle 
rampant within the anti-war move­
ment. Having grown up playing 
folk guitar, Alper always fantasized 
about running away and joining a 
rock band.
