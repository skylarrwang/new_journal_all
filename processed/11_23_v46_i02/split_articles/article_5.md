up to meet the ground with their eyes, 
and wheelies, hoisting the front wheel 
to hang, suspended horizontally, off the 
back of the bike. Canestri and Fusco’s 
gravity-defying, 
eye-widening 
tricks 
carved out a name for New Haven in 
the biking world, drawing many more 
bikers to the area and more of those 
already in the area to biking.
“They do tricks and controlled slides 
in very close proximity to each other,” 
marveled Mario Galasso, co-owner of 
the Freedom Road Harley-Davidson 
dealership in Branford. “When they’re 
doing their shows, it’s like an orches­
trated ballet.”
Canestri and Fusco declined to 
speak on the record about biking, cit­
ing concerns about an ongoing lawsuit 
brought against them by the city of New 
Haven. In 2022, Mayor Justin Elicker’s 
administration sued five defendants 
affiliated with Eastcoastin over a party 
and stunt show the business hosted in 
2021. The City claims that the event 
broke a Connecticut law requiring 
event organizers to cover the cost of 
police protection in any “place of pub­
lic amusement.” The lawsuit separately 
alleges that the defendants violated the 
Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices 
Act, which “prohibits unfair competi­
tion and unfair deceptive acts,” arguing 
that it is unfair for Eastcoastin to have 
profited from the event while the City 
incurred the costs of public protection. 
Underpinning the ongoing legal dis­
pute is a fundamental divergence of 
opinion between Eastcoastin and the 
City about whether biking should be 
tolerated in public spaces.
Elicker recently launched a joint 
regional task force with several munic­
ipalities neighboring New Haven. It’s 
part of a yearslong effort to combat ille­
gal riding in Connecticut of dirt bikes, 
which have two wheels and are intended 
for off-road driving, and all-terrain vehi­
cles, which have four wheels and are 
meant for off-highway use. In a press 
conference, the mayor said that New 
Haven has seized thirty-three dirt bikes 
and ATVs so far this year.
Elicker told me that there is a differ­
ence between street-legal bikers and dirt 
and ATV bikers. Street-legal bikers sim­
ply break minor traffic laws, while the 
dirt and ATV bikers “do street takeovers” 
and are “somewhat regularly” found with 
guns when they are arrested for biking. 
Although Eastcoastin uses street-legal 
bikes with brakes, headlights, and other 
safety equipment, 
Elicker said that 
he is concerned about similar “street 
takeover” issues when they gather bik­
ers who upset traffic patterns, riding 
through the city en masse.
“In that circumstance, it’s some­
what similar,” he said, referring to the 
2021 event at the center of the lawsuit. 
“Thousands of people came either as 
spectators or riders and completely 
took over the streets.”
Eight of the bikers I talked to said 
the same thing about dirt and ATV 
bikers. They’re kids. They’re hooli­
gans. It’s okay, though—let them live. 
There’s no tension between them and 
the Harley riders, even if there’s ten­
sion between them and the law.
The dirt and ATV bikers, accord­
ing to Voss, are often just 15 or 16 years 
old, and “cause chaos throughout the 
city, break windows on cars, and steal 
bikes. But there’s no tension because the 
groups just don’t associate.”
Killer agreed. In fact, she’s “been in 
the pack a few times,” she said, referring to 
the younger, more reckless crowd. This is a 
common theme among motorcyclists who 
have had long riding careers. It’s custom­
ary to fall in with the daredevils as a young 
rider before graduating to more sanc­
tioned riding styles and bikes. When the 
older bikers I spoke to stop at red lights, 
they are left with nostalgia for their more 
reckless days. Connection, not just danger, 
characterizes the rides of younger bikers. 
“Everyone’s together, everyone wants 
to join in,” Killer said, frying her vocal 
chords for emphasis on toGEther. “Why 
not? We all just want to be left alone 
and be free.”
Dave Molster-Pecoraro, a 51-year-
old biker from East Haven unaffili­
ated with a biker group, credits biking’s 
unifying power for reuniting him with 
his biological father. A few years ago, 
Molster-Pecoraro identified his father 
through Ancestry.com. They decided to 
meet and bonded over their shared love 
of bikes. A few hours after their conver­
sation, he checked his phone to learn he 
had won a Harley-Davidson in a raffle. 
He and his father now take a weekly ride 
together on Sundays. “It’s like we were 
never apart,” he said.
A cheerful Molster-Pecoraro cranks 
up “Hellraiser” by Ozzy Osbourne on 
the speaker of his Harley. He’s offered 
me a ride. I hold on to the skull tat­
too on his upper left shoulder for dear 
life, and without GPS or a watch, we 
set off through East Haven. He salutes 
each passing biker with the “biker wave,” 
extending his middle and pointer fin­
gers downward and curling the rest 
together. His sharp, staccato “ha-ha-ha” 
cuts the wind.
When we pull into a parking lot, 
he tells me it’s impossible to explain in 
words why biking bonds people together 
so well. It’s a feeling you only understand 
when you’re riding. Once you’re on that 
bike, suddenly, you’re sharing an experi­
ence with every other biker you pass.
Galasso, co-owner of the Branford 
Harley-Davidson dealership, told me 
that bikers welcome anyone who believes 
in the freedom philosophy of riding 
regardless of age, background, race, or 
gender. Killer contended that outside 
of the speckless Harley dealership, 
it’s more complicated. She and other 
women have had to work hard to carve 
out space for themselves in the biking 
world, which is male both in constitu­
tion and in temper.
When it comes to intergroup atti­
tudes, motorcyclists, dirt bikers, business 
owners, and joy riders set their different 
styles aside. They coexist, bonded by 
their common passion and mutual value 
of freedom from judgment. Tough child­
hoods are understood, even assumed. If 
you’re in, the acceptance is radical.
And to be in, you just have to under­
stand that the thrill comes when the 
rules go. The wind belongs to everyone. 
A guaranteed equalizer.
“That’s why I brought you for a ride,” 
he smiles. “I wanted you to experience it.”
My hair has ballooned into a fluffy, 
wind-blown tangle. I feel included.∎
