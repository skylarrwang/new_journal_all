Of course it is. Aren't we all? Poets have 
been rash enough at times to repeat the 
idle boast of Horace (himself now hardly 
ever read) that they were erecting a monument more enduring than brass. Novelists 
never have displayed such conceit. The 
worm was in their juicy fruit as soon as it 
ripened; or perhaps rottenness set in even 
before the novel reached its "age of 
wisdom," before Flaubert, Thackeray and 
Henry James. A hundred years ago, or a 
little more, the novelist became aware of 
some of the potentialities of fiction as an 
art form rivalling and succeeding the epic 
and tragedy, having a structure, and 
adopting one or several points of view; 
Criticism of the novel and ever more 
subtle disquisitions on how a story should 
be told, how time might be manipulated, 
how characters could weather the passing 
of years or how they could even be dispensed with, grew so rife that readers who 
naively enjoyed being moved by a powerful novel developed the pangs of a bad 
conscience. How remote we are today, 
and even Flaubert was, from a novelist 
probably superior to him, because more 
natural and less tensely painstaking: 
Stendhal! The latter, after reading the 
famous article in which Balzac had praised 
La Chartreuse de Parme, published in 
1839, naively wrote to Balzac: "It had not 
occurred to me that there could be rules. 
... I had not thought about the art of 
making a novel. ... Following a plan 
refrigerates me." A score of years later, 
Sainte-Beuve answered a novelist, Champfleury (the one who first brandished the 
banner of realism), who had invited him 
to collaborate on a periodical devoted to 
fiction. "The novel is a vast experimentation ground, opening up to all the forms 
of genius. It is the epic of the future, the 
only one which modern manners probably 
allow. But let us not shrink it. Let us not 
theorize too much about it. Let us not 
organize it. ... All expositions and apologies should never cost us one good novel 
which the novelist might be composing 
instead of disserting!" 

If the novel were dying today in the 
Western world, it would be primarily due 
to the inordinate number of disquisitions 
on and around it. These are done with rare 
subtlety by professors who are a hundred 
times more clever at analyzing, dissecting, 
elaborating and formulating their rules 
and their exclusions than mute inglorious 
creators ever were. They have confidently 
asserted that no self-respecting author 
could, these days, tell a story as Tolstoy 
or Stendhal once did, claim to omniscience 
like Balzac or Mauriac, go unashamedly 
to the tragedy of today (in Napoleon's 
phrase), that is, to politics, as Malraux had 
dared do. Their self-assurance has unfortunately impressed a number of novelists; 
not so much in America or in England, 
where creative writers seldom read or 
heed what professors legislate, as in 
France, where much novel writing nowadays is addressed not to the reading 
public, but to the critics who dissert with 
profundity in esoteric magazines and who 
sit on the committees which award the 
coveted prizes. Any literature is in a sorry 
plight if it is composed with a view to 
disarming the objections or to currying the 
favors of a certain critical sect. 

Professors denounced the critical conditions of the novel many times and long 
before the nineteen sixties. There have 
indeed been ups and downs, and after the 
splendid flowering of fiction from 1810-
1880, the "fin de siecle" era was remarkable for its poetic achievement, with 
French and Russian Symbolism, but 
hardly for its novels. Convincing reasons 
were adduced to account for the death of 
the great tradition. The coarseness of the 
Naturalists had gone too far; social issues 
failed to interest a selfish society; psychology had become stale. Just when fiction 
was pronounced dead and buried, new 
novelists appeared on the scene who revived the art of the novel in several lands. 
Before and just after World War I, 
Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Hermann 
Hesse, Franz Kafka, D. H. Lawrence, 
Joyce and Virginia Woolf, belied all the 
sombre forecasts of critics. In France, 
Gide, Proust, Malraux, Giono, Julien 
Green, Celine, Mauriac and Bernanos 
turned the years 1910-1940 into a great 
age of fiction. 

Those giants were in their turn charged 
with having dug the grave of an art which 
had, with them, exhausted all its possibilities. Joyce, Hermann Broch, Faulkner and 
perhaps Proust himself, may perhaps have 
nurtured the dream of making the survival 
of fiction impossible after their own 
achievement. It is, after all, any creator's 
ambition to break and kill their tool, or 
the mold which they had elected to cast, 
so that their achievement may not be 
degraded by imitators or eclipsed by followers who might become rivals. They 
succeed in that monstrously egotistical attempt only in the sense that the truest disciples of Hugo or Mallarme, of Cezanne 
and of Joyce, have to disown their masters 
and strike independent paths of their own. 

Periodically, foes of the art of fiction arise 
who question the assumptions of novelists, 
pour scorn over the platitudinousness of 
their narratives of banal incidents, smile 
at their desperate endeavors to make us 
believe in their puppets and at the contrived pseudo-mysteries which they naively 
forge. 

Paul Valery, then the Surrealists, and 
many others in France-critics, publishers, 
even unsuccessful or retired novelists-
thus assaulted the novel as devoid of inner 
necessity and deprived of poetry. Such 
incessant heckling has proved healthy for 
French fiction. If it achieved little else, 
the novel certainly tried to renovate itself. 
Sartre, Camus and some of their friends 
in the years when Existentialism was the 
rage went to American fiction to find 
sources of renewal, thus moving away 
from Proustian introspection and from 
Mauriac's claim to godlike omniscience. 
Then, with the ingratitude of all intellectual borrowers, they discarded their 
American inspirers. Sartre acknowledged 
that he had proved too severe on Mauriac 
in his youthful polemical article and too 
lenient on Dos Passos' glaring artificiality. 
He reserved his bitterest animadversions 
for the patron saint of the younger novelists, Flaubert, chastizing himself in Flaubert for his own bourgeois features and 
his inveterate love for words. Like many 
men after their sixtieth year, he refused to 
see much validity in the ambitions of 
younger fanatics of the new novel who 
were taking him to task in the name of 
structuralism and of their theories on language. "I have always thought that the 
word was a way of possessing the thing," 
he declared in a dialogue published in 1965 
in the Revue d'Esthetique; "I refuse (the 
French word is stronger, "je repousse") 
structuralism inasmuch as it is behind me: 
I have nothing behind me." The determinism of the structure which constricts 
authors and characters (or mechanical actors) in the recent French novel is profoundly incompatible with the faith in 
freedom and in man's ability to create his 
own values which has always animated 
Sartre. A society may not, but a man may 
always break away from his structure and 
act in an unpredictable way. 

If the modern novel in France is today 
in danger of languishing, and is indeed 
finding few readers relative to the greater 
success of traditional novelists, of sociologists, of reporters and of philosophical 
popularizers, it is due to a number of 
factors, a few of which may be mentioned 
here. 

First to a failure of nerve in the novelist 
himself: to his lack of naivete and to his 
...
