You really don't hear too much talk about Yale's mission to produce a thousand leaders a year any more. Last year, with the Singer Report and its accompanying rhetoric, it was still in the air, but even then it was dying, and now, as the Seventies are upon us, Yale's obligation to give society her bankers and stockbrokers is all but forgotten.


Not only are new graduates forsaking the old ways, but a little liberation is beginning to seep down to recent alumni, too. There's one Skull and Bones man-Jerry Clark, '65-who no longer wears a three-piece suit. In fact, he no longer wears anything at all. Clark, a professional actor, has been making his living in a nude revue in New York, "The Way It Is," a show of the "Oh, Calcutta!" genre that until a couple of weeks ago was playing at a new theatre on the Upper West Side. It's a long subway ride away from Wall Street.


The show wasn't very good. In fact, Clark quite frankly calls it "the worst show I've ever done." But he also calls it "liberating," which is a hell of a way for a Bones man to be making his living. "It's sort of like skinny-dipping," he says. "It all hinges on whether you're comfortable in your own body. There are a lot of people who shouldn't take their clothes off."


The cast rehearsed fully clothed; nudity did not emerge until the dress rehearsal-or a close approximation to a dress rehearsal since the confused management of "The Way It Is," anxious to capitalize on New York's nudity craze, never got organized enough to schedule a real rehearsal. The skits-full of men's room jokes and worse-were written by a middle-aged Westchester dentist and rehearsed by the cast as the dentist's forty-ish wife sat in the front row and scowled.


Once things finally got under way-at $7.50 a head-the show began to attract fairly good crowds. Most were male-"They were all there to see the boys," Clark acknowledges-and very few were below thirty. Later in the run, many of the older Jewish couples from the theatre's West Side neighborhood began to fill the audience, providing an appropriately bizarre foil for the picture of a Skull and Bones man frolicking nude on the stage.


Jewish matrons, however, cannot make a show, even one with a Yalie in the raw, and "The Way It Is," alas, folded in mid-January at considerable financial loss.


Maybe the liberation ain't all that widespread after all-when some of the other '65 Bones men came to see their brother make the big time they laughed, but when they came backstage to congratulate ol' Jerry they seemed sort of nervous, and then they sort of gazed back and forth at their wives and they didn't know what to think.


High class bathroom inscriptions seem to be quite the rage these days-not that they ever were not, of course, but now literacy talent is becoming increasingly visible in the handwritings on the wall. Such is the case in one bathroom in Ezra Stiles College, where a talented group of limerick and epigram writers created a stall that was a virtual gallery of eloquent graffiti. The curious flocked from miles around-well, from entryways around-to see this stall, and its creators were justly proud. They had deftly wedded man's baser instincts with the higher arts.


But alas, not all agreed, and one sad morning last week the poets-in-residence entered their inner sanctum to find their graffiti gone, the tiles washed clean, and in place of their work, a clenched, Magic Marker-red fist.


Surely, they reasoned, this could not be the work of a puritan minded custodian. It wasn't. It was, it turned out, a member of New Haven Women's Liberation who took it upon herself to censor these gentlemen's creations.


Of all people, indeed.


Walking through the campus, one is impressed with the solidity of the buildings, with their sheer stoniness. Perhaps it is this manifest capacity to endure that convinces the alumni that Yale in its most essential parts is unchanged. From 1937 to 1966 under the editorship of Buzz Bronson, the Yale Alumni Magazine participated in this judgment. The magazine recorded the anniversaries and histories of old buildings and the ground-breakings and dedications of new ones, the successes and failures in game-by-game detail of the various teams, and in the "Class Notes," the present doings of the sons of Yale. Most of the message seemed to be that, although growing, the old blue mother was unaltered, that she is what she was, alma mater.


Perhaps that was all very true for the largest portion of Bronson's time as editor. The world was not quite so much with Yale, and the world itself, had it been there, probably would have sat down, shut up and worked for a B.A. Now everybody stomps out or occupies. Nobody shuts up, and the worth of a B.A. is questioned by students and Spiro T. alike.


So Bronson's successor was in for a very different world and, as Yale became involved in it, a very different home-ground for his magazine. In addition, the average age and degree of professionalism of his audience had shifted. About the time of Bronson's retirement, the number of alumni from the graduate schools began to equal the number from Yale College, and the number of alumni graduated after 1950 began to equal the number graduated before. It is to the credit of Bronson's successor, William Hamilton Jones, that he did not ignore change or the world, and that he presumed and believed in the expertise and humanity of his readers.


Tony Jones' intent was to use the magazine not just as a memory prod for old blues but as quite another kind of prod. It became the instrument of connection between Yale and the issues uprooting American society, between the Yale of now and the mythical Yale, and, consequently, between all those things and the alumni. The "Class Notes" remained. "At the University" continued, changing only as its subject matter changed-and that is very much. The feature articles were less about sports and buildings and more about faculty and student reflections on their roles at Yale and Yale's role in the community and the country. Breaking with Bronson's precedent, articles on issues independent of the University-drugs, poverty, educational experimentation, welfare reform and the family and its functions-made their appearance.


Joel Katz, responsible for the shape of Tony's intent, has photographed Yale with incisive, touching precision. His pictures are less often presentations of an article's author or action shots, than they are reflections, giving one a sense of the specialness and revelatory character of the objects and faces photographed.


Katz drastically changed the magazine's graphics too. The mix of heads, columns and photographs makes one glad to look and curious to read. The print stands up straighter and sturdier more often, refusing the temptation to slop into a more decorative, narrow-limbed and nostalgic slouch. The equality of size formerly allotted to each word of the magazine's title-Yale as large as Alumni as large as Magazine-has been disturbed. Yale is biggest of all, and without closer examination, one might take yAM to be Yale Magazine-and he would be half-close to right.


The magazine has consistently refused to pander to the need to reminisce. It is about Yale now, which is far more extended than Yale then. Ex-Yalies seeking escape into those more distant, sheltered and dead-end times have been denied. And they have complained achingly; perhaps much as they complained when they wrote that first paper or did all that research Junior year.


So Jones has realized his intent. The magazine has come to function for the alumni as the University once did-it educates them-and not as radical to liberal, but as Socrates to the Athenians.


Jones gave up the editor's spot last summer. As a result, Katz had to change his outlook from one whose primary concern was with the magazine's graphics to one that included its editorial content as well. But now Katz is leaving too. And with him goes the dazzling fact of collaboration with Jones between 1966 and 1969.


Ren Fructin, now acting editor, has one hard job ahead.

**Title: The real underground**
**Page number(s): 3**

At first I suppose it is the noise that you notice most, followed by the wave of heat. It sounds like hell. Like Hell, that is. A kind of whistling, mingled with the sighing of many souls. Not an intense sound but a primeval one. You know it has been going on in there for a long time.


Tentatively you enter, and the door, old and heavy, swings shut-a bit too quickly for comfort-and you turn to lock it again with some reluctance. But you have to. Then the sound, that geothermal sound, so unequivocally there, begins to recede and become a part of you and where you are: the Tunnels.


Everyone has heard about them. Some of them have been momentarily humanized-De Basement in Berkeley College, dramatics, Merriwell "raids" on Commons in the Old Days ("Gosh, Prof., how'd the President's Cassock get up there?"). But most, the vast and forbidden network, connecting all of Yale underground, exists as rumor-the tunnel beneath the tunnel, the door with no number that opens on a stairway going down, the partly overheard, lunchline conversation of that senior next door of a "secret" below ground route edging mystically close to (penetrating?) Book and Snake.


Keys are a requisite for the Yale tunnels. Not special ones, but an accretion of the common passkeys that sprout from the corrupt aide, the unwary janitor, the power plant man out for lunch. But most stop at the College gates; after all one is enough. They don't work everywhere. You hear another rumor in the key crowd: the Grand Master. It will open any Yale (Sargent) lock. Then you begin to notice keys; trade them; and above all, copy them. A word about keys at that. Besides the room number, so homey, so used and warmly stamped, there are other signs. "LN" and "LC," in a lozenge, elsewhere maybe a faint M. They seem to be associated with the longitudinal grooves in the key. So that's why Branford doesn't fit Silliman! But does Silliman fit the impenetrable Branford attic storerooms? Try it and see.


It is the older Yale that is the mother lode of doors. Morse and Stiles, even unto Beinecke, have disappointingly finite doors, ingenuous and exposed and postwar piping, featureless and integrated paneling with lights. Where are the groaning and lockwired valves, hidden poorly behind moldering composition board insulation? No plastics. Where are the fine brass knife-switches to plunge the Old Campus into darkness in April? Where are the pipes that carry the sweltering heat to the sixth floor of Calhoun?


The infinite doors of the old Colleges and the Old Campus. You are trying your keys (all three, by this time, with two promised and one hinted) on the way back from dinner thinking you can enter the tunnels to avoid the winter rain. None of the keys work much of anything. Some firewood, wrecked bicycles, DC-AC converters (God, imagine having one of them in the room to run the KLH?), dust, the smell of stone and exfoliating plush couches, some andirons. Nothing much. The old darkroom, and then ... valves, pipes and noises. Finally something not useful, but interesting. And very much bigger than you had thought. And in the rear, another door, an iron door with a bar, and a different lock. Your three keys don't fit, and the door is warm. It must be, you think, the tunnels, the Steam Tunnels. And now you know why the maintenance men have such a big ring of keys. And so you forget about keys and the tunnels for a while; over vacation and reading period, why bother?


But there was a time in the life of every Yale man in those desolate 1950's when he made it to the Tunnels. The chance would come perhaps when a door was left open next to the squash courts, perhaps when a really daring friend would unscrew
