Letters: What should medical 
education be? 
Following are three of the many letters 
received in response to the cover story 
"Yale Med: How Long on Top of the 
HilJ?" which appeared in the November 
23, 1969 issue of The New Journal. A 
reply by author Jim Ross follows the 
letters. 

To the Editors: 
The article "Yale Med: How Long on 
Top of the HilJ?" by J im Ross in the Nov-
ember 23 issue of the New Journal has 
brought to light a few essential questions 
which face Yale University in the teach-
ing, research and practice of its health 
professionals. 

It delighted me that Mr. Ross began the 
article by describing the contribution of a 
medical student, Mr. Barry Rand, when 
he spoke at the American Association of 
Medical Colleges. Many of us admire the 
courage and capability of Mr. Rand (as 
well as other students such as Bruce Bloch, 
Mary C h arlson, Richard Katzman, Jane 
Silver and Peter Orris) to examine, under-
stand and search for solutions to problems 
in our health-care institutions. They de-
serve great credit for their contribution. 

Mr. Ross makes clear that Yale must 
ask, "Are our doctors educated to meet 
the needs of their clients?" The question 
must also be asked with respect to the 
lawyers, architects, nurses and clergy Yale 
educates. Society in general and the New 
Haven Community in particular are saying 
clearly and loudly that their needs are not 
being met. Many of us in the Yale-New 
Haven Medical Center who have heard 
community residents such as Margaret 
Leslie, Rose Harris and Ronald Johnson 
speak, recognize that we must be willing 
to take their observations into account. It 
was unfortunate that Mr. Ross wrote about 
the controversy between the Connecticut 
Mental H ealth Center and the community 
as if it arose from a personal difference 
between the principles involved. The real 
issue is the ideological difference in defin-
ing mental illness and prescribing therapy. 
Those who adhere to psychoanalytic 
theory a nd practice do not understand the 
efforts of those who help by changing the 
environment as well as or in addition to 
changing the patients psyche. 

Just as important as redefining mental 
illness and assessing psychiatric therapy, 
all the health professionals at Yale Univer-
sity would do a great service if they re-
defined illness in general. Ray Duff and 
August Hollingshead have suggested just 
that, and also implied that we understand 
the circumstances which cause people to 
come to ask for medical help-and what 
treatments are helpful. 

Perhaps Mr. Ross's article will be the 
catalyst to stimulate Yale and its profes-
sional schools to redefine its goals, revamp 
its education and research and its rei a- · 
tionship with the community. Then Yale 
could indeed be a model for other univer-
sities to emulate.

I applaud the concern of Jim Ross for the 
residents of the Hill, a concern shared by 
so many of his schoolmates. This is a wel-
come change from my college days in the 
McCarthy era when any social criticism 
was discouraged and critics sociaJiy 
isolated. I am not prepared to agree with 
his point of view which, though well inten-
tioned, is anti-intellectual and destructive. 
First of all, poverty is not a medical 
illness, nor is juvenile delinquency nor 
adult crime nor racism nor riots. Phy-
sicians are not trained to deal with these 
problems, nor are they capable of handling 
them without compromising everything 
else they must accomplish. Alcoholism and 
other addictions, though called "diseases," 
are not diseases in the same sense as dia-
betes or meningitis .... Lead poisoning 
occurs in the setting of poverty. It is really 
caused by social factors which involve 
cupidity, landlords, tenants, ignorance, 
neglect of children, and emotional distur-
bances which give rise to pica. Physicians 
can treat lead poisoning but have done 
little to prevent it. The main questions are: 
Should physicians take on immense social 
problems as subjects which are properly 
included among their professional duties 
as practitioners of good medicine? and, if 
so, how should they go about it? 

I think that physicians have the obliga-
tion to usc their professional authority 
individually and in groups to bring pres-
sure to bear upon the political structure 
to provide a kind of intervention in press-
ing social issues which is truly the respon-
sibility only of government. Perhaps phy-
sicians have been remiss in this and have 
not done enough. However, social issues 
are not medicine, and to include them as 
part of the province of practitioners or 
even to devote to these problems a large 
section of time in the medical school cur-
riculum would be to dilute medical prac-
tice and knowledge with potentially 
catastrophic results. The art of medicine 
is so complex, knowledge so immense and 
yet so inadequate, the responsibility of the 
physician so vast and the need to act in 
an individual case so pressing that lives 
would be lost if the medical student and 
practitioner were also immersed in the 
great problems of society which have 
frustrated so many others who were better 
qualified to deal with them. 

The second point is that a great medical 
school must regard research and teaching 
as its primary goals. Community serv1ce 
is subsidiary to these. Lest I appear cold-
hearted and unpractical, let me give an 
example. It might have been possible for 
someone to argue 20 years ago that money 
spent on basic research in virology and 
immunology would be better spent on the 
victims of diseases such as polio. There-
habilitative measures such as the Sister 
Kenney treatment and bracing were suc-
cessful and available only to those who 
could pay for them. Here was social in-
justice! How could a medical school with 
any pretensions to excellence not try to 
provide rehabilitation to the entire im-
poverished community in which it was 
located, even at the expense of basic re-
search? Yet the development of techniques 
which have all but eradicated polio from 
the United States would have been impos-
sible without basic research performed at 
the expense of service. The practicality of 
basic research has been proven so many 
times over that further examples are un-
necessary but the appropriateness of its 
primacy at Yale does not depend on prac-
ticality. For Yale University is in the 
knowledge business and knowledge is 
austere. It is to be pursued for its own sake 
and not for the many dividends it bestows. 
Education and knowledge are the major 
concerns of Yale Nniversity; they are the 
whole purpose and justification for its 
existence. 

I do not mean to imply that service is 
unimportant, but if Yale does not, through 
its interest in teaching and research, pro-
vide adequate medical service to the com-
munity, the city has a responsibility to 
provide it. Not only has the city of New 
Haven not provided a city hospital or city 
clinics, but it has not paid the Yale-New 
Haven Hospital for a fraction of the costs 
of caring for welfare cases. The responsi-
bility for community health is, in the last 
analysis, the community's and not Yale's, 
and pressure to improve medical service 
should be applied not to President 
Brewster but to the elected officials of 
the government.

This letter is written to correct untruths in 
an article by Mr. Jim Ross, published in 
the New Journal on November 23rd, 
1969. 

I. It is not true that the Hill neighborhood 
and the ghetto provide most of the people 
the medical school "needs" as quoted with-
out correction. People need medical and 
health care, and the Medical Center pro-
vides most of the institution-based care for 
all of the neighborhoods of New H aven 
and the surrounding towns. Ecological 
data concerning patients and where "most" 
of them come from are easily available to 
anybody with a minimal degree of jour-
nalistic conscientiousness ..• 

2. Neither Dr. Max Pepper nor "Doctor" 
Fichtenbaum (what "doctor" is he?) re-
ceived a grant for anything. Federal grants 
for "Community Medicine," i.e., specifi-
cally the Hill Health Center, were pro-
cured through the efforts of Drs. D. Cook, 
R. Weincrman, M. Pepper and F. C. Red-
lich. Another grant was procured for the 
establishment of a catchment service, i.e., 
total mental health services to a defined 
area, the Hill Neighborhood and West 
Haven in this case, by Dr. F. C. Redlich, 
then Director of the Connecticut Mental 
Health Center. Dr. Max. Pepper was put in 
charge of this service and Mr. Fichten-
baum assigned as the chief social worker. 

3. This catchment area contained then 
72,000 people, presumably not every one 
of them a "potential patient." The staff 
of this service didn't "discover·· the condi-
tions listed; they were well known to exist 
became they are endemic throughout the 
nation. 

4. At no time was Dr. Max Pepper serving 
as Acting Director of the Connecticut 
Mental Health Center, and Dr. Redlich 
was not then "on vacation," out at an 
International meeting. He returned im-
mediately upon being advised of the riots 
in New Haven. So did Dr. Gerald Kler-
man, who had just been appointed Direc-
tor of the Center. In the meantime, Mr. 
John O'Connor and I were the senior 
members of the Department present and 
involved in, and responsible for the opera-
tions of the Department of Psychiatry of 
which the Center is a component. The 
second floor of the Center was not taken 
over by state troopers. 

5. Neither Dr. F. C. Redlich nor Dr. G 
Klerman ever "condemned" the Connecti-
cut Mental Health Center's action during 
or after the crisis. It is true that we-
psychiatrists included-proved to have no 
competence in the logistics of emergency 
evacuation of a neighborhood which we 
helped arrange. Later there was critical 
evaluation of our operation during the 
crisis by ourselves, and by staff not directly 
involved, as there should be. 

6. Dr. Pepper did not leave New Haven 
"shortly afterwards." He moved into the 
Dean's office as had been planned prior to 
the riots to work in community medicine 
and health projects commensurate with his 
interests-a distinct advancement over his 
previous assignment to a single Mental 
Health Service unit. ... 

7. There is no particular "research-service 
conflict" at the Connecticut Mental Health 
Center, and the operation which began 
under Dr. Pepper has continued to grow 
and develop including "effective exchange 
of ideas with its neighbors." 

8. Mr. Harris's appointment last spring re-
sulted from Dr. Kleeman's concern with 
the Center's insufficient involvement and 
communication with neighborhoods out-
side the H ill-West Haven area where we 
were making progress. 

9. Barry Rand and Mary Chadson are en-
titled to their opinions, but they should be 
identified as such. Miss Charlson, how-
ever, may need the services of an opthal-
mologist. If Mr. Rand "committed a nine-
teen-year-old mother with two young 
children to the state mental institution" 
he acted illegally, as only a physician can 
legally do this. Incidentally, the CMHC is 
a "State Mental institution." 

I 0. Beds for detoxification at the CMHC 
have not been "denied," although the num-
ber alotted is inadequate, but so are the 
number of beds for all other psychiatric 
conditions if they were all to be taken care 
of by the 67-bed CMHC. It was never 
designed to take care of "all" problems of 
any type. 

I I. The Yale New Haven Medical Center 
is participating in the treatment of lead 
poisoning and always has. Prevention of 
this condition requires community action 
and health education. to which Yale is also 
contributing specificaly through Dr. L. 
Levin, who is in charge of Health Educa-
tion programs in the Department of Epi-
demiology and Public Health. 

12. Mr. Ross could easily have informed 
himself of these matters. He, furthermore, 
failed to inform himself of the complex-
ities of the issues involved and prefers to 
see "gulf factions .. and the like instead of 
appreciating that many people in the medi-
cal school are concerned and involved with 
improving health services, and in estab-
lishing community-university partnerships 
in these programs. Many of us have 
worked in this direction for many years-
long before the CMHC opened its doors, 
but its doors were opened because of the 
vision of such a community oriented men-
tal health service by local pioneers in 
social psychiatry: Drs. Redlich, J . V. 
Coleman, M. Senn and A. Sol nit, the late 
B. Roberts, and Professors Hollingshead 
and J . Myers, and by Professors l. S. Falk 
and R. Weinerman in social medicine.

Professor of Psychiatry 

The awhor replies: 
Two of the above letters challenge my 
New Journal article as "untrue" and "anti-
intellectual and destructive:· 1 think these 
accusations ignore two significant limita-
tions which I faced as a journalist in writ-
ing the article. First, my views on the sub-
