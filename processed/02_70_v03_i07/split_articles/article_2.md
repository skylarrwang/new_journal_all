the old lock and replace it with his very 
own from the Bicycle Shop. But somehow, 
the day would come. 

And then there it was. The same tunnel 
that James Gamble Rogers designed and 
didn't tell the world about when he drew 
up the plans for the hulks of Sterling 
Library and the Law School just above .... . 
There is room to walk freely, to stand up, 
to leave the iron door a few quick steps 
behind before smashing your forehead on 
a transverse pipe ... and then you move 
on. 

The Tunnels are not to be explored by 
one person. There are no maps. When you 
emerge your roommate sees, besides your 
skinned temple, that you are dusty and 
covered with sweat. You had hardly noticed except that the courtyard felt 
deliciously cool. 

A few nights later, after this beginning 
test, the real thing, the real trip. You, 
avoiding the late paper, your roommate 
finished (as usual) with his, are glimpsed 
in the basement by two squash players. 
An odd sight: flashlights (two), keys (up to 
five, now) on rings (like the pros), tools 
(pliers, screwdrivers in three sizes-including a Philips head), wirecutters, compasses 
(BSA 1954 issue), a little string (remember 
Theseus?), and the most expendable jogging-
shirt, culled from the bottom of the 
bureau drawer, still redolent of the fall's 
bladderball. 

The new lock works perfectly, the inner-
door opens easily, but it seems darker. 
There is no dim light to become accustomed to; it is darkroom-black and you are 
heading north from JE in a wide high 
corridor, flanked by the huge pipes and 
their sound, following the flashlights' 
beam. Shortly, a branch to the left. Duck 
some pipes, be careful. About a hundred 
degrees hot, but getting cooler. Turn back 
from what must be the Pierson-Davenport 
analog to your entrance and rejoin the 
main stream. Another hundred yards, and 
the sound is much louder, and then a sharp 
bend, and the noise is almost deafening-
do you dare get closer? It is a huge valve, 
dripping with scalding water and shrieking as the steam turns the corners of its 
construction. You duck by it nervously and 
head on slowly and suddenly emerge into 
light. A roomful of pipes and valves, obviously a control room of some kind beneath Saybrook. Lots of little machines, 
pumps, panels with switches. But too well 
lit to stop and hang around. Find an exit 
where the tunnel continues, and notice for 
the first time the manhole covers ten feet 
overhead, the gratings. That is why it is 
cooler. But dark again, and you talk in 
whispers as it gets hotter and narrower, 
the pipes crowding in. Then inevitably, 
another door. A patient selection of keys, 
"LN" is sticky but it works. It actually 
works, under the ground! A little cocky, 
now, and not prepared for the next door, 
a gate. The flashlights are failing, the heat 
enervating and getting worse especially 
where the tunnel rises to cross something 
(what?) and the ceiling pinches down. You 
could faint in there from the heat. Next 
time, bring salt tablets. 

The gate, near the Library. It's easy with 
some bent pliers to hold the hasp bolts 
through the grating. And then in the massive sub-basement of the Sterling Library. 
It is big and there are large stairs and the 
bottom of the elevator shaft is there-where 
the elevator would stop if the operator 
piled on a few too many negative g's on 
the trip down from the Boswell Room. 
Where you would stop. The basement of 
Sterling is a bad place to be coin-theft-wise 
so try to find a way through. Dead end. 
Big iron doors, hot to the touch. To HGS? 
The Law School? But all locked. And you 
know that up above, in the nave of the 
Sterling, The Gutenberg Bible rested once 
in splendor, lit in its glass case on a bronze 
pedestal, glowing all night through. (What 
if, years before the Beinecke had removed 
all hope of-if not dreams of-acquisition, 
the metal stairway up from the Sterling 
sub-sub-sub-sub-basement had been used 
for the archetypical prank? The plans are 
laid: one group through the tunnels across 
the pipes, up the stairs to the door inside 
the men's room anteroom. Another to 
wait in the room for corroboration of the 
"harmless prank" aspect of the raid. And 
another two to climb, burlap (what else?) 
sack in hand, up the stone stairs and to 
dash, cutters ready, into the light, to work 
swiftly, smoothly, the brain surgeons, on 
the glass and to remove the precious Bible, 
one of twelve, they said, in the world. 

And then down, and back, smudged, 
perhaps out a Saybrook door, into the 
trunk with the cargo, and then ... to 
Argentina? Or to my room in JE, where 
campus police would never think to tread. 
Laugh on, you skeptics, I still maintain 
to this day that we could have pulled it off. 

Backtracking to some places where the 
pipes proliferate and disappear off to one 
side. Time to crawl a little, which is what 
you've been trying to avoid thinking about 
too much. But promises of Berkeley and 
possibly the Old Campus draw you on. A 
very bad trip, you discover, as you realize 
that just beyond the pipes there are about 
four inches of grey dust that you have just 
bellied through. It goes well with sweat: 

And then in new, fresh, standing room an 
old ladder leans against a demolished 
brick wall, with more blackness beyond. 
One of the old foundations. Over the top 
and into hands-and-knees crawling past 
the brick footings of Berkeley, below all 
the tunnels on the sand of native New 
Haven. You could get lost in there, easily, 
if your lights went out. A very bad scene 
to imagine. 

Bricks and rubble everywhere and the 
constant problem of aiming the flashlight 
while crawling; no wonder miners wear 
those hats. Emerging to some more room 
to stand, or crouch rather, and see a new 
opening ahead, over the pipes and cables. 
A tunnel once again. It feels good to stand 
up in the heat and feel familiar concrete 
underfoot ... to feel familiar Yale there. 

It is time for confident striding, for the 
knowledgeable fending off of cobwebs, 
and avoiding the hot pipes and looking for 
cryptic chalkmarks of masons and electricians and plumbers working together. 
Their message of long ago is for you: 
"21 ft. Vlv 234 Nov 7 36." Confident and 
free beneath (you think) the Berkeley 
tunnel heading north (you're sure). And 
the tunnel turns, just where it should, but 
does not go up the stairs and on to Commons in the sunlight, that familiar route to 
rainsoaked Freshmen. The tunnel goes on 
-the stairs, when you do come to them, go 
down to you, so a test is made: to climb 
up, and carefully open the unmarked door 
from the wrong side and see the friendly 
basement hallway. But in a new way, an 
alien. 

So back down and gleefully on to Commons in Dink Stover's path. "Grub Street" 
is submerged and commodious, and even 
lit, and you enter the ancient kitchens but 
touch nothing because being there, getting there is what matters. Under Commons, Yale enters the ground with confidence and opulence with wide ramps and 
screened-off, pre-refrigeration vegetable 
coolers. It is cool and airy, and in the distant stairwell light there are the ubiquitous 
white tiles that link you to the surface. 

Here are more rumors: that you can get 
from Commons to the Physics labs; that 
there are crawlways there too; that there 
are trunklines of cables; that it is easy to 
get lost, and the locks are unfamiliar; that 
is a winding way, fraught with cul-de-sacs. 
But how does the tunnel get under the 
railroad tracks? You are beginning to 
notice the topography. There are many 
very old buildings on the way; do these 
have central heating, city power? Or are 
they fed too by the Plant? And the new 
buildings in the Kline complex. Wonder 
at the incredible basis of the Tower; can 
you crawl below those massive pediments? 
Or is it like Harkness Tower, unassailable. 
You remember a stone, visible from Branford courtyard ... "taken from the bedrock seventy-four feet below the ground." 
Can you hear the bells there? 

The sciences are best approached directly, from their own entrances, with 
a separate set of keys. So turn to the Law 
School, or to Silliman and Byers Hall and 
perhaps on to Timothy Dwight. But you 
have seen their tunnels shining up at you 
in the daylight, as opulent as Grub Street. 
And who can tell about Book and Snake; 
what strange exudate of ritual lies below 
its Doric block? Beinecke Library is a 
foregone conclusion; you have heard how 
it sinks three stories to a concrete slab, 
how the pumps worked night and day to 
keep its foundations dry, and most of all, 
like Morse and Stiles, it is new and has not 
found its alliance with the dirt. And so 
threading (the heat back again in force) 
east of Commons. It is very hard going-
the worst yet as the concrete walkway 
pinches and heaves, and loose cordons of 
cables make seeing difficult. 

The heat is becoming fantastic. At one 
abrupt rise, a sort of gas-dome (Science II 
is full of handy analogies), the temperature 
rises and the heat is very bad. Later you 
enter from the Law School with a lab 
thermometer and it reads 180 degrees 
Fahrenheit. You check your reading to 
be sure. That's what it is there, 180 degrees. And very dark, a red dark. But 
the dome is passed, and the temperature 
drops to a refreshing 110Â°, which is like 
a cool breeze as you walk together slowly 
toward HGS-and inevitably, what had 
seemed so far away, the Power Plant. 

HGS is ignored. Who cares? The Power 
Plant. There are more pipes, more heat 
and a new noise. Most of all, a new noise. 
The shrillness is still there, but the note, 
the fundamental, is emerging as a deep 
humming, fitted to the heat. You are conscious of the giant rushing outward of heat 
and power through the pipes as you 
wriggle and twist past the outcrops of 
bulkheads. You can feel yourself getting 
nearer. 

And at last the great room opens out. 
It is not a control room, only the pipes 
and cables there in the heat. But there is a 
staircase-metal, like a fire escape-going 
up to a door. Is this really the Power 
Plant? The door is cool, it must be. (Remembering the open portals, the sandstone lions, the courtyard and the generators inside on your devious way to the 
gym.) 

So open it. 

Damn, an ALARM! 

So walk out casually, just Yalies, right? 
Curious, right? The bell is loud. The lights 
are greenish-yellow. Offices, cubicles. 
Charts. A man in a sport shirt walking fast 
to where we are. OK, smile. "Follow me," 
he says, "I've got to call this in." Follow 
him, docile, looking around. "Yeah." 

He goes into a little office. Must be a 
complicated alarm. Probably goes off in 
Phelps Gate. Take a curious walk to see 
the generators. The courtyard. The big 
open doors. Run like hell, over the bars. 
Into the courtyard. The gate. Where the 
hell is the gate! It is cold as hell. Look 
back, see him walking fast past the 
generators. 

Over the fence. A Yale fence, wrought 
iron. Up. Do not slip. Do not slip. 
Jump. 

And run like hell towards Morse; you 
hear another thud, look back; it's Charlie, 
run like hell; don't look back, feel suddenly 
cold and naked on your left leg but run up 
the passage stairs, down the passage stairs 
between the Colleges three at a time, to the 
Tower, up the stairs; don't wait for the 
elevator. Twelfth Floor, stop. Knock. 
Sheldon? Let us in? Safe. Quite safe. And 
tell the story .... 

And Tuesday to walk to the gym, 
curious, to see half a trouser hanging 
from the fence. Quite safe. â¢
