Dick Cavett is a Yalie. 
by Martha Gershun 
At the Yale Club in New York everyone 
gathers 'round the television screen these 
days to wave their handkerchiefs when, at 
one in the morning, the strains of "John's· 
Walts" mark the end of "The Dick Cavett 
Show." For Dick Cavett is one of them, a 
graduate of Yale College-dass of 1958. 
And more importantly, he is successful 
one. 

Yet there are paradoxes in Dick Cavett's 
success. His hours on the home screen-
where time is money is no metaphor-have 
been spent in conversation with Allen 
Ginsberg, Ralph Nader, Paul Weiss, public 
figures and personalities whose intelligence 
had remained hidden from the viewing 
public whether or not they had ever been · 
seen on television. 

Cavett's first two ABC network talk 
shows ("This Morhing," seen daily from 
March 1968 to January 1969, and "The 
Dick Cavett Show," generally seen three 
times at week at 10 P.M.last summer) re-
ceived a variety of accolades that only tele-
vision could inspire and endure: too good, 
too intelligent to last, a noble experiment. 
Noble experiment is television critics' talk 
for we know it's a wonderful show, but 
poor in the ratings and bound to be can-
celled. Cavett's prime time nobility evoked 
not only critical favor but steadily (if 
slowly) climbing ratings during his summer 
joust. 

The ratings, however, didn't save the 
show, and among its September replace-
ments was "Jimmy Durante presents The 
Lennon Sisters." Cavett's reprieve came in 
late November when ABC hired him for its 
late-night talk show. ABC was worried by 
Joey Bishop's low ratings, so the network 
forced his swift retirement. Cavett's resur-
rection was well deserved, but television 
traditionally saves its best for a special 
kind of sacrifice; one recalls the period in 
the late fifties when the networks were 
crying "I love you but you're too good 
for me" to their own Playhouse 90 and 
Armstrong Circle Theatre. 

The switch from television's Siberian 
summertime to the big time in the nightly 
talk show was as ragged as it was quick. 
Cavett's first shows were technically flawed 
by awkward moments of suspension as 
cameras cut to and from commercials. Yet 
the content of the show rapidly took a 
pleasant texture, if a sometimes forced 
one. To an extent the program developed 
a liturgy. Each guest seemed to praise 
Cavett, applaud the real honest-to-god-
we've-finally-escaped-mediocrity quality of 
the show, and swore they watched it every 
night, before the communion would begin. 

And for all the frenzied hyperbole, the 
element of truth was there in those pro-
nouncements. So little Dickie Cavett is 
arrived. 

Yet, for all of the novelty the show has 
brought to television's entertainingly mind-
less talk shows, Cavett the man is in some 
ways a little less novel. He's like many who 
come more quickly to mind these days, a 
man of the fifties. Yale 1958: a year not 
often cited for stimulating events, dynamic 
style, or very much of anything, in New 
Haven or elsewhere. Cavett too is low key. 
He's on but he doesn't glitter. He's funny 
but the laugh is in the eyes. He's built solid 
and small at the same time, so the impres-
sion comes in one look. He admires Jack 
Paar, Stan Laurel and Groucho Marx,

whom he originally worshipped back in 
Nebraska as emcee of "You Bet Your 
Life," the quintessentially innocent TV 
quiz show that rewarded contestants with 
a flying duck and twenty-five dollars if 
they said "stove" or "motor," the evening's · 
secret word. 

Cavett remembers Yale as being peace-
ful, except for the beginning of the ice 
cream riot. "There was rivalry," he recalls, 
"between a Good Humor man and some-
one else on the post office corner, and stu-
dents took sides. But actually that was 
before I went to Yale." 

"I remember Adlai Stevenson being 
booed as he came up to speak. He was in 
a motorcade; there was terrific booing, 
and I remember not knowing what the 
issues were." 

But in the Yale of the fifties, when train-
loads of seniors left after graduation for 
Wall Street, there was a bit of the unusual 
surrounding Cavett. For he was the only 
senior in the 1958 Class B.ook who desig-
nated his future occupation as the "enter-
tainment business." 

Although he worked as a copy boy for 
Time after leaving Yale, Cavett's ambi-
tions were still directed towards the "en-
tertainment business," directed strongly 
enough to land him a job on Jack Paar's 
writing staff after he simply approached 
Paar with a freshly typed monologue. 

Cavett later tried out a stand-up comedy 
routine in nightclubs such as New York's 
Bitter End and the hungry i in San Fran-
cisco. He was not an immediate success, 
and he's still not enthusiastic about club 
dates. "When you're actually up doing it 
it isn't bad. It's finishing one that went well 
and thinking I've got to do another later 
so I haven't gained anything. If I were told 
by an evil fairy that I would never go back 
into clubs I would not be unhapy about it." 

"It was pleasanter when I was in Chicago 
because I know some people there. I've 
stayed at Hefner's house, which is a funny 
experience. He's up in the middle of the 
night. He wants to play-I think it's called 
Risk-that game where you dominate areas 
of the world on a board. I introduced word 
games into the Hefner house. That irri-
tated him because all the bunnies were 
going around playing Perquacky ... I was 
the insidious word game influence. I un-
derstand it's died out. It took it about a 
year and a half." 

What "entertainment business" eventual-
ly came to mean was television, or, rather, 
seven and a half hours a week of public 
conversation about the urban crisis, Las 
Vegas, French cooking and Southeast 
Asia. He plays an excellent host. He's 
more sustained than Steve Allen, less 
threatening than Jack Paar, not nearly as 
innocuous as Merv Griffin, nor as slick as 
Johnny Carson. Cavett's guests talk for ten 
minutes or more without a commercial 
interruption, or a joke. 

Unfortunately, there is the occassional 
tendency to facile balancings of the guest 
list: hence Senators Goodell and Tower 
come as a team. Yet, this is partially com-
pensated for when, in his more brilliant 
moments, Cavatt manages to manoeuver 
seemingly unbalancable guests into vigor-
ous discussions. Recently, he led Margaret 
Mead and Ann Corio, the queen of old 
time burlesque, into an amusingly reveal-
ing dialogue on sex and morals. There was 
Margaret Mead, the dumpy, scholarly 
spinster, advocating sexual and moral lib-
eration while Ann Corio, the liberated 
stripper, vehemently came back arguing 
for conservatism and restraint. 

On another evening his guests included 
Johnny Mathis and Democratic Senator 
Gale McGee of Wyoming, who was there 
to respond to Wayne Morse's strong re-
marks made on a previous Dick Cavett 
show against the Vietnam war. Backstage 
ten mjnutes before the taping was sched-
uled to begin Johnny Mathis was hurrying 
around half naked in sneakers and white 
ducks. A tall, dark wavy-haired man in a 
black suit, Gale McGee, arrived with his 
twelve year old daughter and was directed 
to a secluded chamber. On the stage a 
young woman sat staring under bright 
lights into a TV camera. She said she was 
the "color girl", and as a visitor asked her 
the qualifications for the job a man in grey 
sharkskin gestured feverishly at her side. 
Several tall men with sunglasses and silk 
collars and breast pockets strolled easily 
from camera to control booth as the an-
nouncer began to "warm up" the audience. 
The announcer's name is Fred Foy, and 
he is familiar to many as the voice that 
used to roll out a mighty "Heigh Ho 
Silver!" during the golden '40s. He warms 
the audience with the same patter every 
night the show is taped: a laugh about the 
distant balcony, a mjld insult for the band-
leader, a reminder about the importance of 
the studio applause signs. 

Behind him Dick Cavett is just arriving 
backstage. In mustard slacks and a green 
cap. After he has checked with his secre-
tary to see that the guests have arrived he 
retires upstairs to his dressing room to go 
over the opening monologue with his 
writers. The tight, brassy little ABC or-
chestra strikes up the lively introduction 
theme. Cavett strides out smiling, this time 
in grey slacks, and jokes for ten minutes. 
During the commercials Cavett.talks on 
his desk telephone and exchanges nods 
and smiles with his writers, who are now 
in the first row of the audience. As the 
camera moves in for the return close-up 
he looks up and waits. 

Johnny Mathis sings two songs. Senator 
McGee, his lefi foot trembling, talks for 
some time about Vietnam and answers 
Cavett's questions about the Tonkin Gulf 
resolution. When the band begins to play 
the theme for the final roll of credits, and 
the stage manager signals that the show is 
over, Senator McGee takes a piece of 
paper from his pocket. He wants the auto-
graphs of Johnny Mathis and Dick Cavett 
for his daughter. Cavett can excuse the 
Senator's lapse for he himself has hustled 
mementos of the great, even of his idol 
Groucho Marx. 

Cavett met Groucho at GeorgeS. Kauf-
man's funeral. "I just decided to walk over 
to where the funeral was. Beautiful day. 
I went in, and there was Groucho across 
from me, which gave me a great thrill. 
I never expected that he actually existed. 
All the big people associated with the 
Roundtable were there; it was a nostalgist's 
paradise. Groucho sort of split off from 
them. I thought I would accost him and 
I did, corner of 81st and Fifth. I worked 
for Paar at the time so I said I'm in the 
business. He said 'you want to walk a 
ways'-he loves to walk-so we walked all 
the way down to the Plaza.". 

"Then we got to the Plaza and he said, 
'Well you're a nice young man and I'd like 
to take you to lunch.' Since then I kept 
up the friendship. I still can·t believe it.'' •
