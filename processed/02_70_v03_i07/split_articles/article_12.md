What ho! 
A medium priced amplifier 
that really sounds fine 
Medium priced amplifiers have always been a problem. 
Most of them boast in large advertisements huge numbers of 
"watts", but few actually produce any quantity of clean 
undistorted power. Those that produced power often had an 
over-bright transistor sound. What could we recommend? 
Nothing. Until Pioneer. The Pioneer SA-500 is rated at, and 
produces, twenty-eight real RMS watts. It will drive good 
acoustics suspension speakers with amazing clarity. It costs 
one hundred dollars and we guarantee it for two years. 
Come play with it in our store.
