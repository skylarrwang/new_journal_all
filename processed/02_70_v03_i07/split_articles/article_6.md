Now Preacherman gets up to stretch 
his legs a bit, and as he struts around 
the kitchen he looks a little more like the 
North Carolina hillbilly he claims to be. 
And even though he doesn't speak with 
the bitterness of the Panthers he still 
has some of the regalia of the upcoming 
revolutionist. For one thing, he cannot 
be separated from his blue sunglasses. 
Indoor, outdoor, rain, or shine, he wears 
them. He has cowboy boots too, with 
moderately high heels, and they stick 
out from under his light blue work pants 
as he strolls across the floor. 
Other expressions of current revolu-
tionary fashion are acknowledged by 
Preacherman. Not even he could hold 
up his head in revolutionary circles if 
he were without his black vinyl jacket. 
Practically every respectable revolu-
tionary has a black vinyl jacket. 
Preacherman's jacket is hip length, 
and it has buttons, much like the ones 
worn by the Panthers. 

Tom Oostou, another Patriot who, 
among other things, acts as a sort of 
boyguard for Preacherman, stands near 
him in a doorway wearing his own black 
vinyl jacket. Dostou had a personal run-
in with the law a couple of weeks ago, 
just after the Patriots got started, and 
the Party claims Dostou is the victim of 
police harassment. He was picked up 
on charges of non-support of his wife 
in front of his house on the evening of 
January 21st by detectives of the New 
Haven Police Department and was 
turned over to the state police, who 
charged him with illegal possession of 
controlled drugs and, without making 
any specific charges, vaguely asso-
ciated him in a press release with the 
murder of a UConn coed last Novem-
ber. The Patriots say the charge of non-
support is false, and they claim they 
cannot even find out who filed the com-
plaint. They claim Dostou's wife, the 
Child Welfare Bureau and the Family 
Assistance Bureau all deny it. In addi-
tion they say the "controlled drugs" 
found on Dostou were actually prenatal 
pills for his obviously pregnant wife. 

Then Larry Moore, the New Haven 
chapter head enters in his jacket; only 
his is shorter, and it has a big steel 
zipper instead of buttons. It is a lot like 
the motorcycle jackets white working 
class boys wear around the local drive-
in hamburger stands on Saturday 
nights. Larry himself is of the working 
class. He went to the University of 
Oregon in Eugene for a while and 
dropped out to work with the Patriots 
when they set up a chapter here. Fes-
perman says Larry was such a good or-
ganizer that the national headquarters 
in the Yorkville district of Manhattan 
picked him up and brought him back 
East. About a month ago, he was sent to 
New Haven to set up a branch and be-
come its head, known as the " New 
Haven defense captain" with-in Patriot 
circles. 

According to Preacherman, most of 
the Patriots came into the Party like 
Larry Moore did, with no other back-
ground in radical activity. He says they 
come because they see that the Patriot 
way is the only realistic approach to 
problems of social oppression. 
"Sure, we support any party or or-
ganization which serves the needs of 
the people, but most people in the Pa-
triot Party have not been in the old 
movement-no peace work, or draft 
resistance, or civil rights, or SDS. We've 
had some of that too; we've even had 
requests from whole chapters of the 
SDS to join the Patriot Party. But most 
people just come in off the street and 
get to work. 

"We have some problems, too, having 
all these different people around. These 
intellectuals come in, and they have all 
the solutions. Well, they want to look 
at the psychological side of everything. 
They have to be remolded. And we get 
street people too who come in and are 
all for running out and blowing up 
police stations, and they have to be 
remolded too. You can't make a revolu-
tion with just a mind or just a body. 
You have to have both a mind and a 
body in the revolution to make it." 

" In the meantime, though, we're go-
ing to support some of those upperclass 
organizations too, like the peace move-
ment, as long as they see that the basic 
needs of the people have to be met. But 
we're not issue-oriented ourselves; we 
have a revolutionary program." 

Moore takes off his coat, and every-
one leaves the kitchen and goes into 
the front office, which probably was a 
living room back when the headquart-
• ers was just another rundown duplex. 
Not that it is any less rundown these 
days, but now it is the home of most of 
the New Haven Patriot Party. The col-
lective, as they call the group, exists 
for reasons of theory and of everyday 
convenience. It provides an opportun-
ity for the Patriots to be full-time revol-
utionaries, and it gives them a chance 
to try out primitive socialism before 
the big revolution comes along. 

At meetings of the collective theoreti-
cal and practical problems are thrashed 
out in criticism and self-criticism ses-
sions. According to Moore, it is at the 
collective T-groups that matters such 
as the issue of women's liberation are 
fitted into the party's Marxist class 
analysis. 

The Patriots do not have much use 
for student revolutionaries in their 
movement, and no place at all for them 
in their collective. The students may 
think they are working for the same 
thing, but Fesperman says they have 
yet to show they really mean it. He has a 
bemused contempt for the students who 
agitate for revolution. The Patriots 
think the Weatherman are downright 
funny, or would be if they were not do-
ing the name of the revolution so much 
harm. 

For the Patriots being a revolutionary 
means being a revolutionary all the time 
and never being anything else. A stu-
dent, they say, cannot by definition be a 
revolutionary. One must either be a 
student or a revolutionary. Among the 
New Haven Patriots is a former Yale 
student who joined the Party, but he is 
a rarity. The Patriots have low regard 
for New Haven's leading educational 
institution ("a big sick hunk of brain") 
and its students ("if you students let 
Chairman Bobby die in the murder trial, 
you're all punks and we're going to beat 
the shit out of you" ). According to the 
Patriots' formal position as stated by 
Fesperman, the idea of a student revol-
utionary can never work. He is from the 
wrong social class, and he does not un-
derstand "proletariat thinking." 

" Proletariat thinking is working 
twenty-four hours a day on meeting the 
needs of the people." according to Fes-
perman. " That's why the people here 
live together; they can be·here and 
share things, and devote their whole 
lives all day and all night to meeting the 
needs of the people. If they need money 
to live they can get jobs for a while, or 
they can hustle money from liberals 
like I did myself after I went up to Up-
town in Chicago from North Carolina. 

" Hey, you know what Uptown is like? 
Did you see Haskell Wexler's Medium 
Cool? That place where that cute hill-
billy gal lived is Uptown, and you can 
bet that that poor little kid in the movie 
is still living there," and he talks some 
more about life in Uptown, deliberately 
trying to skip over mentioning that be-
fore he went to Uptown, he attended the 
University of North Carolina " for a 
while." He tries to avoid mentioning 
such things, to avoid letting himself 
look as smart as he may actually be, to 
make sure he really does sound like and 
talk like a typical working class man. 
Sometimes he slips and makes a knowl-
edgeable reference to a movie or a 
book that a typical " dumb hillbilly" 
wouldn't. But most of the time Preacher-
man pulls off the "dumb" stance pretty 
well. 

While Preacherman is talking and 
drinking his coffee on a chair by the 
front window, Annie sits behind the 
desk, still answering the phone and 
listening as different Patriots file in and 
out. Behind Annie on the wall is a huge 
Confederate flag. She is wearing a 
button which says "Resurrect John 
Brown." Preacherman performs some 
strenuous logical acrobatics to explain 
the connection. 

" See, the way we figure it, John 
Brown was doing the right thing, only 
he was doing it for the wrong reason. 
He was doing it for religion, and he 
should have been doing it to meet the 
basic needs of the people. Now if he 
had gotten together with Nat Turner, 
then nothing would have stopped 
them .... 

"The flag? Well, you see, the reason 
for the flag is that it represents the 
South. The South is going to be where 
the revolution comes from. The South 
will rise again, only it will be different 
this time. C. Vann Woodward and 
Robert Penn Warren live around here, 
don't they? C. Vann Woodward writes 
all that stuff about the burden of South-
ern history. Well, somebody ought to 
tell that history teacher that the South's 
going to rise again. 


111 The New Journal I February 8, 1970 
" The poor Southerners have seen 
everything. They don't even know what 
racism is because the poor people-all 
poor people-practice primitive social-
ism. Call it Christian brotherhood or 
whatever you like, but it's really social-
ism. And maybe it's because Souther-
ners have seen all these things that 
we're going to be the first to say, 'That's 
going far enough!' 

"You see, I know the South. I know it 
scares some people when they see a 
film like Easy Rider. The bad South. But 
those are mostly petty bourgeois people 
-the ones who scare and the one who 
gets scared. Hell, those guys are the 
capitalists. 

"We Southerners, we grow up think-
ing we're inferior. We always feel we 
have to prove ourselves. We could beat 
people up, but that doesn't prove we're 
not inferior. We've got to prove we're 
smarter too. And maybe because we've 
seen what we have, we'll be the first to 
end this system." 

Then he talks for a while about the 
specific plans he has for setting up 
Patriot Party branches In the South. 
He calls the whole effort an "educa-
tional" one, to change people's minds 
by changing their social situation 
through concrete action. 

"We're in this class struggle. There 
are lots of oppressed people, and his-
tory's going to change. Capitalism isn't 
that bad, you know; at least it's better 
than feudalism and whatever went be-
fore it. History's going to change, and 
we're here to help it. People have to 
be remolded. 

"We're following In the steps of our 
American forefathers. You know, 
George Washington and Thomas Jeffer-
son and all. They say all men are equal, 
and then they practice slavery. Well, 
we're going to change that. We're going 
to make the country follow what the 
Constitution is supposed to mean; we 
want to put the country back together 
again. 

"We know we can't make a conclu-
sion for history. But we do think we see 
in the Rainbow Coalition the beginnings 
of a national liberation struggle in this 
country." 

He is really preaching now, and no 
one else in the collective can get a word 
in. But then he realizes what he is do-
ing and stops. He leans against the 
bookshelf and starts talking with Annie 
in a more conversational tone of voice. •
