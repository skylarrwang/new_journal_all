conviction that he henceforth Jives in the 
"era of suspicion" announced by Stendhal: 
hence that there is no fundamental absurd-
ity in the world and in man's behavior, 
is dead and gone. It rested upon the dis-
carded assumption that the real is rational, 
hence that there is no fundamental ab-
surdity in the world and in man's behavior, 
that describing things as they appear to be 
endows them with a significance. It is by 
no means certain that a return to realism 
is out of the question in the fiction of 
tomorrow; indeed there are many inven-
tories of objects in the fiction of this very 
day and a lurking conviction that "les 
choses" and their obtruding omnipresence 
are displacing man from his erstwhile 
regal position as the ruler of this sublunar 
world. The regrettable feature of Robbe-
Grillet at his worst, of Pilhes and Pingel 
and other devotees of endless and repeti-
tious inventories is that their realism, un-
like that of Balzac and Zola, of H einrich 
Mann and even of Frank Norris, is not a 
visionary realism. It grants far too little 
to the eye which pierces through the be-
havior of people and the motionlessness of 
objects and which transfigures them. 

Second comes the glibly repeated asser-
tion that the novel, especially when it de-
picted the rise and fall of families, the 
conflict of father and son, and the in-
heritance and the dilapidation of estates, 
was bound up with the ascent of the 
bourgeoisie. Since the bourgeoisie is now 
in its demise or already dead, the syllogism 
goes, the novel is likewise dying. Nothing 
could be more ridiculous than the ease 
with which such a groundless piece of 
reasoning seems to be accepted by writers 
on fiction, old and young. For the bour-
geoisie rose long before the novel came 
into prominence: to it were also addressed 
the Roman de Renart, The Canterbury 
Tales, Moliere's comedies, indeed the 
tragedies of Racine and the Miltonic epic. 
The industrial revolution and the French 
Revolution established the bourgeoisie 
more firmly in its moneyed interests, in its 
power and in its self-contentment. If 
YES! 
novelists wrote for that class, they did it in 
a strange way, exposing its selfishness, its 
lack of charity, its greed, its secret corrup-
tion. Balzac, Stendhal, Flaubert, Zola and 
other novelists elsewhere acted as the de-
termined grave diggers of the very group 
from which they stemmed, and the more 
fiercely assailed the bourgeois was, the 
more willingly he bought and often sub-
sidized those novels. He was either in-
credibly naive, or incurably masochistic, 
or uncannily perfidious in realizing that 
attacks and caricatures by Daumier and 
Flaubert acted as a healthy safety valve 
and left him all the freer to fleece the poor 
classes and to fatten himself on the favor-
ite pastimes of the bourgeois: gastromony 
and extra-marital love. 

Sociologists notwithstanding, things 
have not changed. It will be recognized 
some day that the years of triumph of the 
bourgeoisie were not 1840 or 1860, but 
1920-1970. And no decline is in sight. 
The aristocrats, who had long since ceased 
to count, have been absorbed by the 
middle class. The workmen and the farm-
ers are so "em bourgeoises" that one has 
to go to underprivileged lands of Africa 
or South America today to meet the true 
proletarians. Intellectuals, novelists, com-
posers, painters all stem from the bour-
geois class or migrate into it. Security, 
intellectual comfort, the enjoyment of 
leisure, the ambition to leave one's chil-
dren better educated and richer than their 
parents were, the urge to invest and gamble 
on the stock market: all these characteris-
tics of the bourgeois have spread to the 
whole society today in the Western world. 
It is because the bourgeoisie is so universal 
and so powerfuJiy entrenched that it is, in 
words at least, derided and indicted by 
writers and by the new romantic idealists 
of the modem world, the hippies. If the 
art of fiction flourishes when a certain 
stability prevails in society and when the 
novelist feels attuned to his milieu, one 
wonders why it did with Defoe or Balzac 
or Dickens or Dostoevsky.
