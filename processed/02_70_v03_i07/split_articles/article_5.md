HISTORY IS GOING TO CHANGE, 
SAY THE PATRIOTS, AND THEY 
AIM TO HELP IT. 
by George Kannar 
She's a pretty girl, Annie is, as she 
passes by on her way to answer the 
phone. She leans across the desk, lifts 
the receiver, says in a sweet business-
like voice "All power to the people," 
then she giggles for a second, pauses, 
and completes the phrase, " Patriot 
Party, can I help you?" 

Meanwhile out in the kitchen, a few 
members of the party sit around over 
mugs of coffee discussing the revolu-
tion's fortunes, which they feel are not 
as good as they might be. They talk 
about the situation in Norwalk High 
School, the Chicago murder of Fred 
Hampton, and the New Haven murder 
conspiracy trial of Black Panther Party 
Chairman Bobby Seale which will get 
underway any day now. 

But all this is small talk. They've all 
been over this before, and it isn't the 
reason they've come. The real reason Is 
that the Patriot Party's national chair-
man is in town to give the New Haven 
branch a little publicity and a morale 
boost as it gets started. Their hope is to 
assume a position in the poor white 
community something like that which 
the Panthers are try to achieve in the 
black community. Right now the Pa-
triots think the best way to win com-
munity support is to "meet the basic 
needs of the people" by providing what-
ever "the people" want, including such 
programs as free breakfast for two 
dozen children in Fair Haven, conven-
ient medical assistance and cheap 
firewood. 

The national chairman, Bill Fesper-
man, known as the Preacherman, has 
been with the Patriot Party since its 
formation about ayear ago, when a 
group of hillbilly radicals from. the Up-
town section of Chicago broke off from 
a local organization called the Young 
Patriots and decided to go national. 
The idea was to set up a national party 
among working class whites to over-
come racism and to make the revolu-
tion. The Patriot platform is practically 
indistinguishable from the Panther pro-
gram, as are its internal rules and reg-
ulations. From the Patriot collective in 
Fair Haven to the New Haven Panther 
headquarters a regular communica-
tions line is kept open; people shuttle 
back and forth all the time. In front of 
Liggett's the Patriot girls, like Annie, 
sell the Panther newspaper to arouse 
some interest in and to generate some 
financial support for the mutual cause. 

The Panthers are generous in the sup-
port they have given the Patriots, rang-
ing from the joint rally in the Yale Law 
School auditorium on January 16th 
to the constant availability of the official 
Panther photographer for Patriot pur-
poses. According to the Panthers, the 
Patriots, unlike student revolutionaries, 
"understand revolutionary discipline 
and get away from the Cultural revolu-
tion shit. We're coming from the same 
trip." 

Preacherman sits in the corner of the 
kitchen watching the local party mem-
bers go about their tasks while playing 
with two little mullato kids, both of 
whom are wearing buttons with hori-
zontal stripes of brown, white, red, 
black and yellow. "They represent the 
Rainbow Coalition," Preacherman says, 
and he tells of the informal working al-
liance between the Panthers, the Patri-
ots and the Puerto Rican Young Lords. 

Preacherman himself makes sure the 
revolution doesn't lose its sense of 
humor. His artificial revolutionary af-
fections are few. Fesperman talks sense 
to his followers with an intelligence and 
wit which frequently leaves others be-
hind. He is a genial, serious-minded 
Abbie Hoffman-serious but always on 
the lookout for a put-on. While the 
Panthers are talking about killing 
Richard Nixon, Fesperman says he'd 
rather put the President to work re-
painting the White House in the colors 
of the Rainbow Coalition button, mak-
ing it a striped Executive mansion. He's 
happy, confident and optimistic, and he 
seems quite content to be making the 
revolution in America. 

" I really love this country, man. I love 
its rivers; I love its mountains; I love 
its ocean coasts. Some people say it's 
lousy; they say they want to get out of 
here, but I don't. I just want to change it 
and make it better." 

The Patriot Party philosophy, as Fes-
perman explains, is a variation of Marx-
ism. It's a lot like the Panther theory but 
the emphasis on racism is less. Most of 
the time the Patriots have to fight the 
charge that they themselves are pre-
judiced, or at least that the people they 
are working with, lhe poor and working 
class whites, are the most prejudiced 
segment of the United States. 

" Well, you know, when we got started 
in Uptown they told us we were racist. 
Well, we checked it out, and we found 
ount that they were racist; only they 
were racist on a higher level. You're 
racist at a high level if you're racist and 
you don't lay it down on the line. What 
you have to do is look at the class anal-
ysis, you have to check out people by 
their social practice. That's the way we 
do it. You have to check out whether 
or not a man's social practice is racist 
before you call him a racist. 

"You know, you always hear that all 
the horrible racist oppressors are in the 
South. Well, that's not so. The Rocke-
fellers don't live in the South; the 
Kennedys don't live there."
