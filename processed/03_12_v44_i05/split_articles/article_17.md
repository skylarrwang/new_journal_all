Mugaburu’s 
mapping 
project 
gained a global platform when 
Google released a program called 
Map Maker in 2008. Google Map 
Maker is an editing tool that allows 
ordinary people to shape, revise, 
and detail public maps of their 
communities online. Citizen mappers 
have put countries like Kazakhstan 
and Romania on the map and have 
kept maps of US cities current using 
satellite imagery, local knowledge, and 
GPS devices. With their help, Google 
Maps has become the most popular 
internet map, garnering 71 percent of 
online US map traffic in February and 
over two hundred million installations 
on mobile phones worldwide.


But as surely as Google has torn 
down the old hierarchy in mapping, 
it has built up a new one, restricting 
access to its data, allowing politics to 
influence its choices, and using free 
labor to turn a profit. Google has left 
behind a movement of citizen mappers 
eager to chart their communities but 
fearful that the spirit of independent 
cartography will be corrupted.


When Mugaburu first took stock 
of Peru’s status on Google Maps in 
2008, he was dismayed by what he 
saw. “There were only a couple of 
cities and they were only half done.” 
Armed with his local knowledge of 
Lima, satellite images, and college 
credits in Geographic Information 
Systems, Mugaburu intended to equip 
Peruvians with the geographic data 
he’d thirsted for himself in Hartford. 
He wanted to put Peru on the map.


Mugaburu 
was 
drawn 
in 
particular to a blank spot that he 
knew to be Pachacutec, a slum of 
200,000 residents north of Lima 
that the government refused to 
recognize. Peru didn’t have the money 
or political will to expend resources 
on Pachacutec’s displaced people, 
so it left the slum off of maps. The 
map’s blankness, in turn, justified the 
government’s assertion that there was 
no official settlement in Pachacutec. 
The result was a wasteland of a city 
with no running water, no electricity, 
no roads, and no health services.


Using Map Maker, Mugaburu 
drew the shoreline bordering the slum 
and all the roads that ran through it. 
When his edits were added to Google 
Maps, people in Pachacutec noticed 
and added street names, schools, 
hospitals, and a technical college. 
Now, Mugaburu said, “in the event 
of a disaster emergency personnel can 
get to places.” But maps have more 
than practical power, he explained. 
“We’re giving people who live in 
shantytowns some sense of place.” 
In his excitement, Mugaburu’s accent 
became more pronounced. He spoke 
for Pachacutec’s citizens: “Yes, this is 
where we are. We are on the map. This 
is where my business is. Come visit, 
just follow the driving directions.” 
When he’s not working at Yale’s 
Sterling Memorial Library, Mugaburu 
now travels to Google conferences 
to speak about mapping as a Google 
Map Maker Advocate.


Mappers like Mugaburu from 
around the world have been charting 
their 
hometowns, 
working 
to 
empower communities often lacking 
a common geographic currency. 
Kyril Negoda, who has made over 
twenty thousand edits on Map Maker, 
grew up in Karaganda, Kazakhstan, 
before moving to Minnesota at age 
fifteen. Karaganda, a mining town 
that once generated energy for much 
of the Soviet Union, withered during 
Negoda’s youth as energy technology 
changed and jobs vanished. As a 
boy, Negoda was a winner of the 
Kazakhstani 
State 
Olympics 
geography, and he watched with a 
cartographer’s eye as population 
loss reshaped the town’s physical 
landscape. But no records were made. 
“Kazakhstan was going through all the 
political and economic changes after 
the Soviet Union. The importance of 
mapping fell by the wayside,” Negoda 
said. A town struggling to adapt to 
changing economic and demographic 
realities still relied on maps from the 
Soviet era to get around.


“I wanted to capture that 
changing landscape in my town,” 
Negoda explained. Giving people 
public access to their geographic 
data changed the way they related to 
their community. They took out their 
smart phones and traced Karaganda 
on Google Maps. When Negoda 
made a mistake, they logged into 
Map Maker themselves and fixed it. 
Karaganda was now known to the 
world—or at least could become 
known—and the investment that 
Negoda first made in his hometown 
“trickled down from top to bottom.” 
Karaganda’s cartographic presence 
also helped its business community 
recruit customers and bring back 
some of the jobs lost during Negoda’s 
youth. Mapped businesses are each 
assigned short Google Maps pages, 
where users can rate and comment 
on them, encouraging more hits and 
more customers, Negoda explained. 
Negoda and Map Maker have helped 
give Karagandans a voice in remaking 
their community.


Anas 
Qtiesh 
ushered 
his 
hometown of As Suwayda, Syria, 
through a similar transition. Before 
Qtiesh took to Map Maker, locals 
relied on their own memory for 
direction, streets were unnamed, and 
the official map was oriented with 
North to the left. State censorship 
kept citizens from acquiring the 
tools they needed to formalize their 
geography; Syria banned GPS devices, 
satellite images, and smart phones. 
“It’s a policy of keeping people in the 
dark,” said Qtiesh, who now blogs 
and maps from San Francisco. For 
Qtiesh, mapping is a tool of resistance 
against an apathy that impairs people’s 
personal sense of place and their 
commitment to political change. 
“Providing maps is a way of fighting 
back against that,” Qtiesh said. “It’s 
about people finding their place in a 
country.”


But the Google Map Maker 
revolution goes further. Mapping in all 
times and all places has given people 
tools to understand their space. But for 
the first time ordinary people, rather 
than governments or corporations, 
are drawing the lines. They’ll draw 
the lines not to snatch territory from 
neighboring states or to make a profit 
but simply because people deserve to 
know their way around. As Mugaburu 
puts it: “It can shift the power 
balance. It’s done by us, not by big 
governments. We know our countries 
best, our neighborhoods, and we have 
the power to change that.”


Google Map Maker claims to 
be part of a democratic revolution 
in how information gets produced. 
When communities generate the 
knowledge, communities can ensure 
that corporate or political interests 
don’t shape the way they get mapped. 
As Google said in a 2011 press release, 
“You know your neighborhood or 
hometown best, and with Google 
Map Maker you can ensure the places 
you care about are richly represented 
on the map.” Map Maker positions 
itself as a project by citizens, for 
citizens, which has garnered positive 
responses. In January 2012, the World 
Bank announced it would begin a 
partnership with Map Maker in its 
grassroots endeavor. Google may 
be a profit-seeking corporation, but 
volunteer mappers put in hundreds 
of hours of unpaid labor because 
they want to be part of a movement 
overturning the traditional hierarchy 
in mapping. 


However, 
the 
may 
be less democratic than it seems. 
Rhetorically, Map Maker latches on 
to the Wikipedia model of bottom-
up knowledge production. In practice, 
Bill Rankin, professor of history of 
cartography at Yale, says Map Maker 
falls short of that vision. “It’s more 
like last.fm and Amazon where people 
provide information to a company 
and they don’t have a voice in how 
it gets used,” he said. “It’s less about 
people coming together to determine 
how their knowledge will be used and 
more about people providing free 
labor to Google.” 


Negoda, who spent five hundred 
unpaid hours over two years mapping 
Kazakhstan, feels betrayed by the 
restrictions Google places around 
its mapping data. “Google needs to 
recognize its place as a partner to 
the community and become a good 
steward of the geographic treasure 
it is entrusted with. Until then, Map 
Maker represents little more than an 
elaborate front in a grand extortion 
scheme.” Earlier this year, Negoda 
dropped his affiliation with Google in 
protest over its policies.


Even 
Mugaburu, 
at 
first 
unerringly positive, acknowledged 
that cracks were beginning to form 
in his loyalty. “I started mapping in 
the good faith that Google will do 
the right thing. I don’t know other 
people’s threshold for good and 
ethical conduct, but they’re getting 
close to my threshold.”


When first joining Map Maker, 
mappers must hand over all legal 
claims to the data they will produce. 
Mappers can’t participate in decisions 
about how the data is used, receive no 
guarantees that it will live on should 
something happen to Google Maps, 
and surrender the right to share the 
data outside of Map Maker. Negoda 
and Mugaburu give over their data, 
trusting that Google will handle it 
in the best interests of the mapping 
community. 


Rather than make freely available

the data it freely acquired, Google 
places strict limits around the use of 
its mapping data. OpenStreetMap, an 
alternative to Map Maker that has a 
weaker global presence but is growing 
in popularity, allows people to use its 
data for whatever purpose and on 
whatever platform they see fit. Google, 
on the other hand, restricts access to 
its data in order to maximize profits. 
Under the Google Map Maker License 
Agreement, mappers are prohibited 
from using non-profit open source 
tools, like OpenStreetMap, to work 
with data introduced on Map Maker, 
killing the possibility of collaboration 
in what is billed as a collective, citizen-
centered project. Another stipulation 
in the License Agreement prevents 
for-profit groups from displaying 
Map Maker data, jeopardizing Google 
Maps’ capacity to build small business 
in developing nations.


Mappers like Mugaburu are 
willing to accept these limitations so 
long as Google doesn’t ask customers 
to pay high prices for the product 
they’ve helped produce for free. But 
prices for Google Maps services are 
rising. In October of 2011, Google 
announced that independent web 
developers whose sites feature Google 
Maps must pay four dollars for every 
thousand Maps views over twenty 
five thousand. Though larger Web 
sites have always been subject to fees, 
the price hikes prompted Apple and 
FourSquare, a social media service, 
to switch from Google Maps to 
OpenStreetMap for parts of their 
applications. Negoda may sound 
like a man with a grudge when he 
calls Map Maker a “grand extortion 
scheme.” But as long as Google 
continues to recruit free labor under 
the banner of bottom-up citizen 
mapping, it can’t guard its data for 
ever-steeper profits without mappers 
and viewers questioning its motives. 
Representatives from Google did 
not respond to multiple requests for 
comment on its pricing and other 
policies.


With final decision-making power 
concentrated in a group of executives, 
dubbed the “Google gods” by 
Mugaburu, data for politically sensitive 
locations is often ignored. Active edits 
to the map of Cyprus were suppressed 
and the country was left blank because 
Google feared offending the Turks 
or Greeks with their use of one 
language over the other. Map Maker 
has closed editing in Gaza, where 
people lack access to basic geographic 
data, even as they face threats of 
violence. In contrast, during the 
Gaza War of 2009, OpenStreetMap 
issued a call for contacts familiar 
with Gaza’s geography to fill its 
online map. “Information is our most 
powerful tool towards peace and 
understanding,” Mikel Maron, a Board 
Member of the OpenStreetMap 
Foundation, wrote on his blog at the 
time. “Let’s work towards openness 
and freedom.” OpenStreetMap now 
features a detailed map of roads 
and public services in Gaza. Asked 
by e-mail why he thought Google 
refused to open Map Maker to Gaza, 
Maron responded in a few terse 
sentences. “There is nothing political 
or financial to gain from opening up 
in Gaza,” he wrote. He speculated that 
“Google also has a substantial Israel 
presence.” Google is likely concerned 
about political spam, but to Maron 
there’s no defense for prioritizing 
corporate anxieties over equal access 
to information.


The combination of Google’s 
price hikes and restrictive policies have 
sucked the spirit from Mugaburu’s 
mapping efforts in the United States, 
though he plans to continue mapping 
in Peru. With mappers discouraged 
from voicing their concerns, Negoda 
and Mugaburu hope that consumer 
pressure will lead to reform. Pressure 
from activists recently compelled the 
World Bank to revise its relationship 
with Map Maker—“if the public 
helps to collect or create map data, the 
public should be able to access, use, 
and re-use that data freely,” a March 
2012 press release from the World 
Bank said—but a more widespread 
boycott remains unlikely. 


A geography teacher at St. 
Thomas Elementary School in New 
Haven recently asked Mugaburu to 
speak to his class about mapmaking. 
Mugaburu began developing ideas 
for demonstrations and activities 
and asked his supervisor at Google, 
Jessica, if she could provide stickers 
and other props. “I don’t think it’s a 
good idea for you to do this,” she told 
him. Mugaburu was discouraged; he’d 
been excited to share his mapmaking 
efforts with a new generation of 
cartographers. Jessica explained that 
an internet protection law prohibits 
anybody under the age of thirteen 
from having an e-mail account. She 
didn’t see why Mugaburu would want 
to promote mapmaking among kids 
too young to sign up for Google. As 
Mugaburu understood her, “if they 
can’t map, what are they good for?” 
wants 
give 
others a glimpse of the power of 
mapmaking, of the personal and 
political transformation that becomes 
possible when people get together to 
chart their world. He wants Google 
to recognize its obligation to the 
mappers who have offered their 
service under this ideal. And above all 
he wants to grant the next generation 
the gift of knowing that there’s a tool 
as powerful as words or songs or 
dances to understand its place and tell 
its stories. Google, on the other hand, 
just wants more mappers.
