         POINTS OF DEPARTURE

Pietro Bembo’s De Ætna, an esoteric 
Venetian manuscript printed in 1495. 
The text’s inventive typography makes 
it one of the most important works in 
the history of the printed word.
The story of the De Ætna type 
begins with Venetian publisher Aldus 
Manutius, who wanted to spread 
knowledge 
by 
printing 
portable 
and affordable versions of classical 
texts. To do this, he hired a master 
typographer named Francesco Griffo.
Griffo 
made 
a 
tremendous 
mark on the history of printing and 
punctuation. It was the De Ætna 
typeface that popularized the use 
of crisp and unornamented Roman 
characters in printing, replacing the 
archaic blackletter script introduced 
by Gutenberg. While Griffo was 
carving the De Ætna type, Manutius 
asked him to devise a way to separate 
interdependent clauses. Griffo solved 
the problem by inventing the first 
semicolon. A few years later, Griffo 
developed another innovation: a 
typeface 
fashioned 
after 
cursive 
handwriting. He called it Italic type, 
after the name of his homeland. 
Despite Griffo’s ingenuity, it 
was Manutius whose star continued 
to rise. Dissatisfied with his relative 
anonymity, Griffo left Manutius in 
1503 and crafted a set of Italic type for 
another Venetian publisher. Outraged, 
Manutius somehow convinced the 
Pope to decree that only the Manutius 
publishing house was permitted to 
use Italic type. Yet the Papal decree 
proved difficult to enforce, and the 
Italic style quickly spread throughout 
Europe. 
Meanwhile, Griffo was ruined. 
He only appears in the historical 
records once more, in 1516, when 
he was executed for murdering his 
son-in-law with an iron bar (which he 
probably used for carving type).
The Yale Typeface is not the first 
to take inspiration from De Ætna. 
Typographer Stanley Morrison’s 1929 
facsimile, named Bembo, quickly 
became one of the most admired 
typefaces of the twentieth century. 
However, when attempts were made 
to digitize Bembo decades later, 
something went terribly wrong. As 
the Yale Typeface website describes, 
“Unfortunately, the more recent 
photocomposition 
and 
digital 
versions of Bembo lack the vigor, 
weight, and formal integrity of either 
the De Ætna face or the original 
Monotype 
version 
of 
Bembo.” 
Designers around the world posted on 
bulletin boards lamenting the loss of 
a classic typeface. Rather than using a 
font lacking in formal integrity, Yale 
hired the world-famous typographer 
Matthew Carter, responsible for 
classics such as Georgia and Verdana, 
to design a private copy of the famed 
1495 original.
To understand De Ætna’s charm, I 
went to view Yale’s copy of the text in 
the Beinecke.  The book was tiny and 
beautiful. While the librarians weren’t 
looking, I brushed my finger against 
the world’s first semicolon; it was 
strangely satisfying. I compared the 
actual book to the printed specimens 
of the Yale Typface and Bembo that I 
had spread out on the desk. With both


Last November, Yale University 
Printer John Gambell stood before 
a group of twenty-five employees, 
spreading the gospel of the Yale 
Typeface. He politely explained why 
the academic departments whose 
communications they designed were 
no longer allowed to have unique 
logos set in their favorite font. Instead, 
their publications had to use the eight-
year-old typeface and the classic Yale 
Blue.  Over the course of several 
years, Gambell oversaw the creation 
of the Yale Typeface and designed 
a new, consistent campus signage 
system in order to standardize the 
University’s brand. But it wasn’t the 
experience of years or even decades, 
but rather centuries, that produced the 
Yale Typeface.
In many ways, the Typeface 
fits right in amongst Yale’s icons. 
It aspires to resemble a centuries-
old European artifact but is in fact 
relatively new—much like Yale’s 
neogothic architecture. The Typeface 
is based heavily on the font used in
