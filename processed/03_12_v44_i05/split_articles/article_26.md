call ‘beefing’ with other groups for 
reasons I don’t know. As soon as you 
get the kids in, you’ve got innocent 
kids that’s being killed as well. You’ve 
already seen the newspaper. There’s 
like, what, thirty-something homicides 
already this year?”

The end of 2011 marked a 
twenty-year 
high 
of 
thirty-four 
homicides in New Haven. Both 
city-led and grassroots initiatives 
have sprung up in response to this; 
the week I spoke to Whitaker there 
was a panel at Cooperative Arts 
and Humanities High School called 
“Fighting Back” attended by two 
hundred people. Panelists included 
our own Allick, as well as Mayor 
John DeStefano, and Dixwell beat 
cop Shafiq Abdussabur. Abdussabur 
is a well-known youth advocate who 
runs a program educating young men 
about gun violence. 

“I know Shafiq,” says Whitaker. 
“I wish more people came to his 
programs, but they’re teenagers, and 
you know how they get. It’s like, 
‘POLICE!’” She raises her eyebrows 
and shakes her hands on either side of 
her head. “I would like to see the kids 
who really need a role model come to 
the program—you really need to reach 
these fifteen-, sixteen-, fourteen-year-
old guys out here. Their trust is not 
going to come easily, even with Shafiq. 
Trust is earned. It’s not given.”

Whitaker says she doesn’t keep 
in close touch with old Elm Haven 
residents who moved away. She 
wishes more of those who stayed on 
at Monterey Place would be involved 
with the Residents’ Council. “People 
were very vocal during the transition 
process. But now they just sit back and 
say ‘OK, it’s done.’ But it’s not a done 
deal. People should still be concerned 
with the problems in the community, 
instead of only speaking up when 
there is a regulation that they have to 
fuss about.”

Although Whitaker would like 
residents to be more proactive about 
setting a positive tone for young 
people, she thinks the changes to the 
current management of Monterey 
Place have made progress as far as 
setting a behavioral standard. She 
would agree with Allick that change 
starts in the mind, and praises the 
landlord for its policies. “Some 
people, you can take them out of the 
ghetto, but they still have that ghetto 
mentality. I’m glad BCJ is strict,” she 
says. “I got tired of living in the Wild, 
Wild West.” 

R
obert Solomon, who served 
HANH for a total of fourteen 
years as director, board member, and 
chairman of the board, was also a 
ten-year director of clinical studies at 
Yale Law School. Since 1994, Yale has 
operated an Employee Homebuyer 
Program that will pay employees thirty 
thousand dollars toward buying a home 
in certain areas of the city that include 
all of New Haven’s “Empowerment 
Zones”—neighborhoods designated 
by the U.S. Department of Housing 
and Urban Development to receive 
special funding because of the 
“high 
unemployment, 
crumbling 
infrastructure, minimal access to 
business capital, and poverty.” Before 
the end of 2011, employees received 
$35,000 if they bought a house in the 
Dixwell zone. Yale has directly funded 
a mixed-income housing project 
downtown called the Residences at 
Ninth Square. 

In other words, when you’re 
talking about making over New Haven 
by determining who settles down 
where, you have to talk about Yale. 
The changes in the city over the last 
few decades would not have occurred 
without the influence of some minds 
from the university, whether they were 
crafting public policy or providing 
private support. On tours, I say that 
New Haven benefits from having 
Yale just as Yale benefits from being 
in New Haven—again, the kind of 
PR you say because you want it to be 
true, not because it is unconditionally 
so. Yale has had problematic effects 
on the city as well, and the truth is 
that the two are so intertwined, it is 
worthless to speculate about what one 
would be like without the other.


This narrative of the university 
benefiting the city has become 
stronger—at least in the press—
over the past few decades. In a sort 
of town-gown university dream, a 
March 2011 Wall Street Journal article 
said that downtown New Haven was 
undergoing a “renaissance—reversing 
a flight to the suburbs and bringing 
people back to the city” due in part to 
Yale real estate investments in the city. 

Allick is not so quick to heap 
praise on the University. He says 
Yale wants to take all of the current 
residents of Monterey Place and move 
them out to a just-remodeled, mixed-
income development in West Rock. 
“Yale don’t want no violence next to 
their school, period. So if they could 
buy the property and move everybody 
out, they willing to do that,” he says 
with raised eyebrows. “Have you 
heard anything about that?” 

I am appalled, but also skeptical. I 
haven’t heard. Where did he hear? 
“There is a guy who lives out 
there in the Brookside”—one of the 
developments to get redone—“who 
used to come and tell us things. He 
would let us know what’s about to 
happen, but he don’t come no more. 
You should check if it’s true.”  

Robert Solomon says there is no 
legal way Yale could do that. “There are 
protections on the subsidies for many 
of those homes, which means there is 
a period of time in which they can only 
go to low-income renters. In Monterey 
Place, some of the protections last 
thirty years, some longer. Somehow 
there is always a rumor that Yale 
would want something like that, but 
they have no way of mandating it.” 

I passed the information back to 
Allick, wondering whether the rumor 
reflected more widely-held stereotypes

in the neighborhood about Yale’s 
intentions with public housing in 
the city. Gallman and Allick’s offer 
to be tour guides to me was part of 
the community outreach projects 
they have been doing since they’ve 
“stepped outside of the box.” The 
first time I met them, they had come 
to eat lunch with some Yale students 
to explain pressures in youth growing 
up in New Haven. Allick wishes there 
could be more informal hanging out 
between Yale students and kids at high 
risk from “the street—from the real 
New Haven.” 

Since our tour, Allick has 
continued this kind of work. He hopes 
to have his criminal record cleared 
soon. Depending on how you frame 
things, Gallman has poorer timing 
or graver past sins—on a phone call, 
Allick told me he had been “locked 
up” for three years. Gallamn had been 
fighting a sales of narcotics charge 
since January, 2010. 

At the end of the day, regardless 
of Yale’s institutional aspirations, 
many New Haven residents measure 
its relationship with the city through 
the Yalies they know. Whitaker could 
care less whether Yale wants graduate 
students to live in Monterey eventually. 
She remembers with fondness a 
program during the seventies through 
the nineties in which Yale students 
would come work with the kids and 
“show them the world outside of 
just this…It’s good to set them down 
and say, ‘you’re a man,’ you know, or 
‘you’re a young lady.’ Fine. But teach 
me how to live in the world.”

O
n Saturday, March 31, two events 
had been carefully planned that 
aimed to bring Yale and New Haven 
communities together. The first was 
a march to protest racial profiling in 
the wake of the February shooting 
of unarmed black Florida teenager 
Trayvon Martin by a neighborhood 
watch volunteer. The second was a 
rap showcase featuring Yale and New 
Haven rappers cohosted by WYBC 
Yale Radio, the African-American 
Cultural Center at Yale, and a new Yale 
student organization called Middleman 
that aims to “improve conduits 
between the university and New 
Haven’s inner-city neighborhoods.” 
Middleman’s founder, Alan Sage, was 
the one who had first introduced me 
to Gallman and Allick. 

At noon on the 31st, an email 
went out to the WYBC Yale Radio 
DJs announcing the cancellation of 
the evening event due to security 
concerns from the Yale Police. An 
email from YPD Assistant Chief 
Michael Patten to the Yale Daily News 
cited “tensions we’ve seen between 
various groups in the city and recent 
incidents occurring outside events.” 
The phrase “fear of gang activity” 
was used by the organizers as an 
explanation for its cancellation. 

The march for Trayvon Martin 
took place at 4 p.m. with gusto. Over 
four hundred participants, roughly 
a quarter of them Yale students, 
gathered at the Q House and marched 
down Dixwell Street and through 
Yale’s campus on Elm Street, circling 
the New Haven Green and ending up 
on the steps of City Hall, where various 
community organizers gave speeches. 
I saw several faces at the march that 
I might have expected to see at the 
rap showcase that evening, but more 
importantly, there were so many faces 
at the march. It was conceived by 
the political action chair of the Black 
Students Alliance at Yale, who worked 
with various other activist groups 
from Yale and New Haven such as 
NAACP chapters and community 
organizers from the Dixwell area. Also 
present was Dixwell-area alderwoman 
Jeannette Morrison, who is working 
with a group of Yale students and 
New Haven residents to advocate 
and fundraise for the re-opening of 
the Q House. There was the rogue 
speaker during comments who made 
sure to remind Yale students present 
that their university was built on the 
back of slave labor, but several others 
commended so may Yale students for 
attending the event.  

G
allman, Allick, and I finished 
up the fall tour of New Haven 
driving by the colony of tents on the 
New Haven Green. “What are they 
doing?” Gallman had asked. I spoke to 
him briefly about Occupy Wall Street 
and dissatisfaction with the wealth 
distribution in the country.  “Ohhhh,” 
Gallman intoned. “Were they the ones 
that got sprayed by the police?”

“I think so, in New York.” 

He and Allick most certainly fall 
in the 99 percent, but they seemed 
a little bemused by the campers’ 
manifesto. The Occupiers didn’t have 
much hustle.

The Tribe, too, has lost some of 
its hustle since it became Monterey 
Place. The Q House and “hood club” 
are vacant, and it’s now “responsibility 
time” instead of everyone having your 
back. Neither City Hall nor the Tribe 
wants to return to the dense projects 
of the past, but I got the sense that 
the old soul of Elm Haven could 
perhaps be harnessed to strengthen 
Monterey Place. The fight to reopen 
the Q house is an example of this 
possibility. Gallman and Allick’s tour 
might be just one version of the story, 
but by holding up the qualities they 
value in their community, they showed 
me the importance of considering the 
souls of New Haven neighborhoods 
instead of just their statistics.
