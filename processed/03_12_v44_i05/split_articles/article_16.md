he Peru that Yale librarian 
Daniel Mugaburu left with 
his family at age thirteen was 
a broken country. On August 8, 1990, 
the night before his departure, the 
price of gasoline had risen by 3,000 
percent. The highway into Lima,

garbage. Terrorist bombings had

by candlelight for weeks at a time. But 
through the chaos, Mugaburu had

“Mapping was a way to familiarize 
myself 
with 
my 
whereabouts,” 
Mugaburu recalled. “It was about 
finding whether I belong here or not.” 
Mugaburu drew the streets that others 
only walked. When he could afford it, 
he went to a local convenience store 
and bought a professional map to
