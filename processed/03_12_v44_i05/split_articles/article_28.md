My Four Pillars chart is 
weighted heavily toward 
Fire. 

Anyone 
schooled 
in feng shui would be alarmed at its 
extreme skew after performing the 
requisite set of calculations with my 
gender and date and time of birth. Fire 
is associated with red, green, triangles, 
and rectangles. These colors and 
shapes in my environment will bring 
out Fire. Being “born of Fire,” as it’s 
called, I am susceptible to ailments of 
the heart and tongue and might seek 
to improve my health by consuming 
mushrooms and apricots. I’m likely to 
become a great musician, artist, actor, 
or writer. I may also have a passion 
for antiques or electronics. However, 
experts consider a chart so consumed 
by one element to be undesirable and 
dangerous, and I should surround 
myself with representations of Water, 
Earth, Wood, and Metal for balance.


I learned some of this from 
special guidebooks and some of it 
from Gregg Nodelman, a feng shui 
consultant who says he has a karmic 
responsibility not to use his privileged 
knowledge to tell fortunes. He worries 
that people may unconsciously work 
to fulfill negative as well as positive 
prophecies and he would prefer not to 
mess around with that. He calculates 
Four Pillars charts, which are also 
called Pillars of Destiny, but applies 
them only to his clients’ physical 
surroundings. He used to do this by 
hand but now uses special software.
“The way I work is, I’m really 
literal,” Nodelman says.


Nodelman is a Metal, so his lungs, 
nose, and large intestine are prone to 
sickness. He is slim and tallish, with 
neat, close-cropped salt-and-pepper 
hair. When I first met Nodelman, he 
was wearing a forest-green shirt and 
striped button-down with skillfully 
matched dark green slacks. Nodelman 
strives for balance by surrounding 
himself with Earth tones like these. He 
does not smoke. He wears hexagonal 
spectacles with transitional lenses that 
are clear inside and shaded outdoors 
so his eyes are at home anywhere. 
Officially, Dancing Dragon Feng 
Shui is based in Nodelman’s home 
office in Branford, Connecticut. 
There, he calculates Four Pillars charts, 
which determine clients’ mingua, or 
favorable directions independent of 
their domiciles. Feng shui is an ancient 
Chinese system for determining 
auspicious arrangements of manmade 
space. It deals not only with rooms, 
but also with their inhabitants, whose 
individual needs—as revealed by 
their Four Pillars charts—require 
differently arranged environments. 
Nodelman also can pin down lucky 
spots in a particular building using its 
location and age, a process he calls 
“flying the stars.” 


Most 
of 
Nodelman’s 
work 
happens on-site, at homes and 
businesses to which people have 
summoned him. He shuffles around 
seats at businesses—a town hall, a hair 
salon—to manipulate the firms’ power 
dynamics. He has found that people 
who ask him to rearrange their homes 
often have bigger problems they wish 
he would solve. Clients break down. 
They tell him about infidelities and 
impending foreclosures. Nodelman 
was once asked to rearrange a family’s 
home and wound up intuiting that 
one son had a drug problem. He later 
found the son’s stash in the ceiling of 
his bedroom.


Nodelman always asks clients 
for their specific goals in seeking his 
services. When I asked him to view 
my apartment, I wasn’t entirely sure 
what to tell him. I was curious to hear 
his recommendations but couldn’t 
rationally conceive of a problem that 
flown stars could solve. I don’t believe 
in feng shui—or even, really, in interior 
decorating. I have a high clutter 
threshold. I never unpack suitcases 
and tend to leave papers and jackets 
and plates strewn about my space. 
After my parents divorced, I grew up 
stuffing clothes into a navy blue duffel 
bag in one temporary bedroom on 
Friday evenings and emptying them 
onto the floor of another, even more 
temporary bedroom, only to restuff 
them two days later. Nodelman 
wonders of his clients, “Does their 
room look like this as a manifestation 
of their life, or is their life like this 
because of the way their room is 
arranged?” I think, “I just live here.”


But this was no reason not to 
see what Nodelman would do to my 
apartment. I gave him my time, date, 
and place of birth, as he requested. 
I managed to come up with a worry 
about my future career. He said that 
was enough to go on. “The feng shui 
leaves people with their own to-do 
lists,” he added. “Whatever changes 
I suggest would have to be done by 
you. I’m not going to move your 
desk.” It’s sometimes necessary to 
move desks because poorly placed 
objects can affect the energy, or chi, of 
a space. A few days before he visited 
my apartment, as Nodelman and I 
were taking a walk around the New 
Haven Green, he stopped and told me 
to point my pen at my eye. 


I maneuvered my pen and looked 
at him.


Nodelman corrected me, pulling 
out his own pen to demonstrate. I 
had to really point it. I placed the pen’s 
business end a few inches from my 
right eye and stared it down.


He asked me how I felt.
“Bad,” I said.
“That’s a poison arrow,” he said 
triumphantly. “That’s what’s coming 
off your pen. You know you’re not 
going to stab yourself in the eye. It’s 
energetic.” He gestured expansively at 
a building overhanging Chapel Street. 
“You know that building’s not going 
to collapse,” he said, “but standing 
under all that concrete and glass, 
you’re going to feel a little bit off-
balance.”


I pocketed my pen and looked 
slightly askance at Nodelman. He was 
standing with his back to a blinding 



Under the Shang dynasty, which 
ruled China from 1600 to 1050 
BCE, diviners burned luminous, 
prophetic oracle bones; under the 
Sung dynasty, which reigned from 
960 to 1126 AD, they practiced the 
first professional feng shui; over the 
intervening two thousand years, 
a series of sages yoked the 
common wisdom for choosing 
sanitary burial grounds to the 
aggregated beliefs of Buddhism, 
Confucianism, Taoism, ancestor 
worship, and elemental and yin 
and yang energies—and came 
out with feng shui, which means 
“wind water.” Many Chinese 
homeowners and businessmen 
still seriously consult its rules. 


When feng shui attained 
fad status in the West during 
the 1990s and 2000s, its focus 
shifted from exterior space 
to interior design and from 
placating ancestor spirits to 
solving 
personal 
problems. 
Practitioners in the West have 
generally 
exaggerated 
the 
astrological component of feng shui 
because of their clients’ seemingly 
bottomless need to control what lies 
ahead. Western feng shui guidebooks 
promise that expertly arranged homes 
guarantee 
love, 
fulfillment, 
and 
financial success. Initiates write letters 
like this to the agony-aunt column on 
World of Feng Shui, a British online 
magazine founded in 1998:


I have placed a raw amethyst crystal 
geode under the marital bed and I am 
sleeping on the right side of  the bed and 
my husband should sleep on the left. I have 
also placed mandarin ducks and a couple 
of  married toys on the table next to my bed 
too with red table lamp on each side. But 
my husband is still committing infidelity. 
He asked for divorce and is ill-treating our 
children. He is a Rabbit and I am a Dragon. 
He is planning to see the lady in July, Aunt 
Agga, please help, I need your advice on 
how I can bring his heart back. I have also 
placed a Rooster with Fan and Amethyst in 
the North of  the living room. Please reply 
soonest possible, as my husband is planning 
to see the lady very soon. Please help, I am 
very sad and desperate for help and advice to 
mend the situation. Thank you.


Aunt Agga replied with horror, 
sympathy, and the suggestion that the 
writer double-check that the crystal 
geode under the bed was clean and 
tied to the bed with red thread.


In some ways, Nodelman and 
Dancing Dragon Feng Shui are 
products of this craze. Nodelman 
studied feng shui at the Metropolitan 
Institute of Design in Syosset, New 
York, whose Universal Feng Shui 
Practitioner Certification Program 
was the first in the country to be 
accredited. However, Nodelman found 
the program too “watered-down” and 
“Westernized.” He notes that feng 
shui was not yet wildly popular when 
he founded Dancing Dragon in 1992. 
While many Western practitioners 
orient a house using its front door, 
Nodelman insists on using the lo pan, 
the traditional Chinese compass with 
dozens of numerals, characters, and 
I Ching symbols ringing its magnetic 
needle. He considers many Western 
feng shui consultants to be quacks. 
He says that some carry suitcases 
filled with wind chimes, crystals, 
and mirrors to sell to gullible clients. 
“There’s a certain practitioner where 
everyone, whether they need it or not, 
gets a bamboo flute over the 
doorway,” he said. 
“We Westerners, we like a 
quick fix. We like that sort of 
magic pill. ‘I need a job; tell me 
where to hang the crystal,’ ” he 
said. “Some people say crystals 
and mirrors are the aspirin of 
feng shui… I mean, look, I’ll use 
crystals or mirrors as cures, but 
I just won’t use them every time, 
and I’ll be cautious about it.” 


As a boy, Nodelman tried to 
hypnotize his friends on the 
playground at recess. He would 
spin in circles to make himself 
dizzy, developing an interest in 
“altered perceptions and how 
your environment affects that.” 
He found kits for strobe lights 
at RadioShack and assembled them in 
complex patterns of light and sound. 
“I’d fairly regularly blow fuses in 
my parents’ house as a kid,” he said. 
When he got a little older, Nodelman 
began to experiment seriously with 
meditation. Decades later, he still can’t 
help scrutinizing the world around 
him and imagining it differently 
composed. He never sees anything 
whole without also grasping how its 
parts could combine more elegantly.


Nodelman grew up in New 
Haven, like his father, Stewart, and 
grandfather, Otto, who founded 
the New Haven Chair Company in 
the 1950s. Nodelman worked there 
summers in high school. After Otto 
died in 1967, Stewart bought the 
business. Nodelman says he inherited 
his father’s eye for design and aptitude 
for construction, though Stewart is 
skeptical of feng shui. Nodelman 
doesn’t blame him. “Some people are 
seekers, and they’re always looking for a 
new awareness,” he said. “Some people 
are just happy with the awareness they 
have.” Nodelman considers himself 
a seeker. After studying industrial 
design for a couple years at Syracuse 
University, he transferred to Southern 
Connecticut State University to be 
nearer the factory. He dropped 
out of college halfway through 
his junior year in order to work 
there full-time, secretly relishing 
the act of rebellion.


By 
then, 
business 
had moved to a new factory. 
Nodelman told me the original 
factory near Fair Haven was 
demolished by Richard Lee, an 
ambitious New Haven mayor 
who sought to renew the city 
by 
manipulating 
its 
spatial 
arrangements in the sixties. 
As Nodelman remembers, his 
family was told that the land 
was needed for a new school, 
which was never built. Dick 
Lee’s infamous failed experiment 
in spatial planning was the 
Richard C. Lee Highway, also called 
the Oak Street Connector. The low-
income Oak Street neighborhood was 
razed to make way for this highway. 
The displacement of an estimated 
two thousand five hundred eighty-
seven people and two hundred fifty 
businesses haunted their former 
community, 
which 
sank 
further 
into decay. The highway was never 
completed.


As his hometown absorbed these 
structural 
dissonances, 
Nodelman 
developed an interest in harmonious 
design. He eventually started his 
own business repairing furniture. His 
wife, Sandra, an engineer with an 
open mind, introduced Nodelman to 
various alternative practices—t’ai chi, 
acupuncture, herbology—and these 
experiences led him to feng shui. 
He felt an immediate affinity for the 
trends his wife had tested; he has used 
a naturopathic healer whom Sandra 
once visited as his general practitioner 
for more than twenty years. “I had 
this hot moment,” he explained, 
“when I realized that the chi that 
you’re working with in your body is 
the same as the chi that you’re working 
with in a space.” When the interior 
designers Nodelman knew through 
his business learned about his interest 
in feng shui, they began to solicit his 
opinion. He decided to seek more 
training and charge for his services. 
Nodelman is now certified to perform 
space clearing and clutter clearing 
ceremonies in which he uses candles, 
incense, and special rites to exorcise 
lingering, negative “predecessor chi.” 
“The earth has energy,” he told 
me. “The earth has memories.”


has 
always 
lived 
around New Haven. He says he has 
hometown pride for this city, which 
has always been peculiar in its physical 
space. While other colonial cities 
like Boston grew organically around 
geographic features—streets twisting 
crazily to follow the course of rivers—
its original nine square blocks made 
New Haven the first planned city in 
the colonies. The ancient Chinese 
used feng shui to plan cities that would 
fit into the existing natural landscape, 
but nothing in nature takes the shape 
of a three-by-three grid. Chi tends 
naturally to spiral—as in seashells, or 
tornadoes.


Westerners usually expect feng 
shui consultants simply to shuffle 
sofas and mutter mysticisms, but in 
fact practitioners have always applied 
their art to larger canvasses than 
interior design. Beijing, Nanjing, 
Luoyang, and Xian, four major 
ancient Chinese cities, were 
chosen for their lucky locations 
and laid out carefully along axes 
that run north to south. Rules 
for auspiciously arranging cities 
were so well codified that a 
Chinese emperor ignored them 
at his own risk. Planned cities 
are often the places where the 
human desire to control the 
environment reaches its fullest 
potential for success and for 
failure.


The Air Rights Garage on 
York and North Frontage Streets 
is a gargantuan parking garage 
built to straddle the Oak Street 
Connector. Instead, the highway 
dead-ends right before it. A section of 
York Street lined by a bodega and a 
couple of fast-food places bisects the 
garage. It is always dark there because 
of the cement mountain overhead. 
Nodelman and I recently walked to the 
Air Rights Garage and looked down 
into the cavernous pit underneath, 
where the highway was supposed to 
run. I wanted to know how Nodelman 
could account for his hometown’s 
predicament. “They weren’t thinking 
about people and nature when they 
were doing this,” he said. “They 
were thinking of engineering and 
construction and traffic flow.”


Dick Lee began to raze the Oak 
Street neighborhood in 1957, three 
years before Nodelman was born.
