the legibility of Bembo and the gravity 
and crisp lines of the De Aetna face, 
the Yale Typeface was the cleanest and 
most attractive of the three.
Most students don’t know that 
they can use the Yale Typeface, but 
awareness of its charm is growing 
on campus. Gambell has his own 
theory about why administrators have 
received it so well: it is something 
private that the members of the 
Yale community can all share among 
themselves. “It’s not as silly as a secret 
handshake, but it has a little bit of that 
cachet.” 
Gambell cheerfully reports that 
so far it doesn’t seem like anyone 
outside the university is attempting to 
use the font. 
“Wait—they’re not allowed to?” 
I asked.
“No, they’re not allowed to. 
They’d probably just get a letter from 
General Counsel saying ‘puh-lease.’”
Like Manutius centuries ago, the 
University is willing to prosecute in 
order to protect its license, although 
a letter from Yale’s lawyers is probably 
less potent than a Papal mandate. I’m 
already preparing myself for the day 
when I’m no longer allowed to use the 
Typeface, only several months ahead.

“I like to know the names of 
things,” David Heiser tells me, and 
his office proves it. The table where 
we sit is covered with piles of framed 
and labeled insects with a jewel-
like turquoise beetle at the very top. 
Behind him is an enormous, pastel-
colored model of a flower’s insides, 
which looks vaguely pornographic. 
And near my hand, the tip of a hairy 
leg is just visible through the crack 
in a pouch marked “Tarantula.” As 
Head of Education and Outreach at 
The hardest part, of course, is 
knowing what we’re seeing. Most 
students hardly know a hawk from a 
handsaw, let alone an ovenbird from a 
thrush. Just as van Arkel had to brush 
up on her galaxy types before joining 
the Galaxy Zoo project, we will need 
to review our bird identification. 
To start the learning process, the 
Peabody organizes bird walks to 
help beginners learn how to identify 
their sightings.  Heiser adds that we 
are currently sitting only a few steps 
away from the Peabody’s hall of 
Connecticut birds, which is a sort of 
“3-D field guide.”
The very next day, I tour that 
hall with Jim Sirch, Public Education 
Coordinator at the Peabody and one 
of the leaders of the museum’s bird 
walks. He appears out of place in 
the faint blue light of the exhibit, as 
though he would be more at home 
up to his waist in brush, or crouching 
on a riverbank. Walking from glass 
case to glass case, he points out the 
different plumages of warblers and 
the difference in size between the 
Cooper’s hawk and the sharp-shinned 
hawk. When I ask him about the red-
tailed hawk I had seen several times 
perched on the gargoyles of Harkness 
Tower, he uses the stuffed birds to 
show me that the juveniles have a 
stripy tail instead of the russet that 
gives the bird its English name. 
I am an avid birdwatcher, so I 
am interested in the details that Sirch 
points out: the number of wing-bars, 
the color of eye-rings. I have spent 
hours staring at far-off shorebirds, 
hoping to catch a glimpse of rarities. I 
have gotten up at the crack of dawn to 
watch geese take off from a flooded 
field. I love swamps. But I struggled 
to see the urgency of birdwatching 
around the quiet, paved Yale campus.
The Yale Office of Sustainability 
thinks differently. The citizen science 
program was the office’s idea, and the 
program is part of its 2010 strategic 
plan to make Yale greener. 
the Peabody Museum, Heiser, along 
with other Peabody employees and 
the Yale Office of Sustainability, leads 
an initiative to create a body of citizen 
scientists, laypeople who collect data 
and report it to professionals. The 
team behind this project hopes to 
harness the simple observational skills 
of Yale’s students, faculty, and staff 
to contribute to the evaluation of the 
University’s urban ecology. 
To many people, the term 
“citizen scientist” seems like an 
oxymoron. It’s easy to imagine citizen 
historians—historical societies are full 
of them. And self-proclaimed citizen 
philosophers are a dime a dozen. But 
citizen scientists? To take part in the 
scientific endeavor, you must need 
a degree, not to mention funding, a 
working knowledge of statistics, a 
command of jargon, and a lab—right?
Not necessarily. In 2007, Dutch 
schoolteacher and citizen scientist 
Hanny van Arkel discovered a green 
blot in the Leo Minor constellation. 
She had been spending her free 
time poring over images from the 
Sloan Digital Sky Survey as part of 
the Galaxy Zoo project which uses 
laypeople to help classify galaxies. 
This green spot didn’t match any of 
the categories van Arkel had learned 
to recognize—and it wasn’t only 
laypeople like her who were perplexed. 
Now known as Hanny’s Voorwerp 
(“object” in Dutch), the blot is as big 
as the Milky Way and contains a hole 
stretching over ten thousand light 
years. Astrophysicists are still trying to 
figure out what it is. 
      “You too can make this kind 
of discovery,” Heiser tells me and 
about thirty-five other volunteers 
gathered in the Peabody auditorium 
on March 26. Our task is simple. We 
are instructed to regularly walk a route 
around campus and make note of the 
birds we see. We will then enter our 
names, the species of birds we’ve 
seen, and the times and locations of 
our sightings into a database.
