The New Journal
psychological relevance, but Knobe 
first published it in a philosophical 
journal. Knobe is an associate 
professor of both philosophy and 
cognitive science at Yale University, 
and he helped found a movement 
that is blurring the lines between 
philosophy and psychology. This 
new approach, called experimental 
philosophy, aims to apply the practical 
tools and findings of the cognitive 
sciences to philosophical problems. 
At first, the term doesn’t make 
sense: a philosopher is supposed to 
ponder deep truths in an armchair, 
not administer studies in a lab coat, 
clipboard in hand. But experimental 
philosophers claim to follow a deeper 
philosophical tradition that predates 
twentieth century philosophy. Plato 
hypothesized on the structure of 
the mind, Hume and Adam Smith 
considered moral judgments and 
empathy, and Descartes tried to find 
the seat of the soul (he settled on 
the pineal gland, a small endocrine-
secreting organ in the center of the 
brain). But the questions philosophers 
ask now tend to be more abstract: 
What does it mean for something 
to mean something? Is a liquid that 
looks and tastes just like water but 
has a different chemical structure still 
water? Are actions good because of 
their consequences or the kind 
of action they are? 

Experimental philosophers 
want to return to the questions 
that 
attracted 
philosophers 
centuries ago, but with new 
tools informed by the cognitive 
sciences. They investigate topics 
such as the way the mind works 
and how morality, rationality, 
and emotion interact, using 
techniques ranging from fMRI 
scans to paper and pencil 
surveys.

I first heard of experimental 
philosophy roughly two years 
ago as a sophomore psychology 
major. I had just grown out of 
thinking of philosophy as its 
worst stereotype: speculative 
nonsense that engages little, if 
at all, with reality. 

My advisor suggested that 
I take a class called “Philosophy 
and Science of Human Nature,” 
taught by Knobe at the time. In each 
lecture, we addressed readings in 
classical philosophy by authors like 
Plato, Schopenhauer, and Marx, then 
turned to modern scientific research, 
often from the last decade, that 
addressed the same questions.

The class left me conflicted. 
Though it kindled my personal interest

oshua Knobe isn’t forty yet, 
but he already has a discovery 
named after him. Imagine that 
a chairman of a large company is 
deciding whether or not to implement 
a new—and very lucrative—green 
initiative. The chairman thinks about it 
for a minute and says, “I actually don’t 
care about the environment at all. I 
just want to make as much money as 
I can.” He implements the policy, the 
air gets cleaner, and the chairman gets 
a new house in the Hamptons. 
Would you say he intentionally 
helped the environment? If 
you’re like most of Joshua 
Knobe’s subjects, you answered 
no, any environmentally friendly 
by-product was coincidental, not 
intentional. In his 2003 survey, 
only 23 percent  of Knobe’s 
subjects answered yes.

Now consider a slightly 
different scenario. This time, 
the program would harm the 
environment. All other factors 
are constant. The chairman 
still doesn’t care about the 
environment, only wants money, 
and goes ahead with the policy. 
The environment was harmed, 
but did he harm it intentionally? 
This time, you probably said, 
along with 82 percent of 
Knobe’s 
subjects, 
the 
chairman did intentionally harm 
the environment. 
The only difference is here is 
morality. But should a decision’s ethical 
status have nothing to do with whether 
its side-effects were intentionally 
produced? The difference between 
the 82 and 23 percent is sometimes 
called the side-effect-effect, or the 
Knobe effect. 
Clearly this finding has some 
“I want to 
know the way 
the fucking 
mind works,” 
Mandelbaum 
told me.
