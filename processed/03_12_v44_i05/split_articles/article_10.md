Pulling Back the 
Curtain
Department of Public Works, which 
directly handles recycling and trash 
pickup, sometimes refuses to pick up 
trash “contaminated” with recyclables. 
But Tang is also looking ahead. 
Eventually, the office hopes to create a 
bulk citywide composting program, a 
goal even more ambitious than raising 
recycling rates. Currently, no facility 
exists in Connecticut to handle bulk 
composting, but the more daunting 
task is getting residents on board. 


Progress still needs to be made 
in the recycling program. While 
the service’s rates have risen, many 
residents didn’t seem aware of the 
single stream policy, much less that 
compliance was a law. Come garbage 
pick-up day, some will put out both 
of their toters, recyclables and trash 
waiting separately. But most won’t. In 
neighborhoods like Dwight, the city’s 
encouragement alone may not be 
enough to effect the change it wants 
to see.

**The Undergraduate Organizing Committee: A Legacy of Activism**
**Author: Not specified**

It’s the dead of night. Most of 
Yale is fast asleep. A handful of stu­
dents sneak around, using chalk and 
fliers to “rename” a few residential 
colleges. They put up signs on Jona­
than Edwards College that read “Titus 
X College,” renaming the seventy-six 
year old college after one of Edwards’ 
slaves. On Cross Campus, they chalk 
the phrase “Emancipate Yale.” Stu­
dents wake up to these messages the 
next morning, more confused than 
angry. Who took the time and energy 
to do this? And why?


Founded in 2002, the Undergrad­
uate Organizing Committee was one 
of the most influential student activ­
ist groups on campus for most of the 
past decade. With a stated mission to 
fight for racial, social, and economic 
justice in Yale and New Haven, the 
group frequently made campus head­
lines, whether for its 2009 protest of 
the names of some of the residential 
colleges or for its less recent 2005 sit-
ins in the Office of Undergraduate 
Admissions to protest financial aid 
policies, which led to financial aid re­
form. Perhaps the group’s most note­
worthy activity was its 2008 sit-in in 
Yale’s Investments Office to protest 
the University’s investment in HEI 
Hotels & Resorts, a company that 
allegedly supported poor working 
conditions. Ben Crosby ’13, a former 
UOC member who currently serves 
as co-chair of Ward 1 in New Haven, 
said that UOC drove the campaign 
that led Yale to divest from HEI. “It 
played a significant role. Or certainly 
the UOC pressure as part of a broader 
student movement in colleges across 
the country.”


Despite its success, the UOC 
deliberately remained small and con­
cealed over the years. “The UOC 
often made a strategic choice during 
campaigns to put the issue out front 
rather than the organization,” said 
Mac Herring ’12, an active member 
for three years starting in the fall of 
2008. “The focus was to make change, 
not to recruit students.” Herring ex­
plained that a group challenging Yale 
on such important issues couldn’t af­
ford to be self-aggrandizing. But the 
UOC’s limited membership and lack 
of visibility also contributed to its 
reputation as a radical, self-righteous 
group. After nearly a decade of activ­
ism, the UOC gradually dissolved in 
the fall of 2011. Why did a group so 
confident in its goals and methods 
come to such a sudden end? Yale’s his­
tory with student activism may help il­
luminate the answer.


History professor Jay Gitlin ’71 
witnessed the heyday of New Ha­
ven political protests during his junior 
year, when a variety of New Haven 
trials involving members of the Black 
Panthers brought radicals and liberals 
from across the country to campus. 
Gitlin called the atmosphere “chaot­
ic,” “bizarre,” and “tumultuous,” and 
he was struck by the visible nature of 
the protest. “You would see people 
hang banners with some sort of po­
litical content,” he said. “Political un­
rest was more public.” This meant that 
students were generally more knowl­
edgeable about the important issues, 
even if they weren’t necessarily par­
ticipating in the protests.


Both Gitlin and another history 
professor, Gaddis Smith ’54, have 
watched open political protest disap­
pear from the undergraduate commu­
nity. Smith recalls a sit-in during the 
first couple of years of the Iraq War, 
in which a panel of teachers and about 
forty students occupied the second 
floor of the Hall of Graduate Stud­
ies to protest the war. When Smith 
asked how many of the protestors 
were undergraduates, only two raised 
their hands. “My general impression 
was that Yale undergraduates were not 
as politically attuned or ready to take 
action as they had been in the sixties, 
seventies, eighties, even in the nine­
ties,” he said.


The UOC dissolved because stu­
dents wanted to reverse this trend and 
make student activism visible once 
again. During the aldermanic elections 
last fall, more than fifty students—
some who were longtime members of 
UOC and others who were involved in 
political activism for the first time—
began canvassing and doing campaign 
work for Sarah Eidelson ’12, a UOC 
member who shared the group’s inter­
est in labor reform. The canvassing ef­
forts contributed to bringing a record 
number of students to the polls in the 
Ward 1 aldermanic race and propelled 
Eidelson to victory. Students were 
more excited and informed than Ei­
delson’s team expected, Herring said.


After members of the UOC saw 
the power of broader participation, 
it no longer made sense for them to
