of the last government benefits to 
remain geographically defined,” says 
Cynthia Horan, a professor of urban 
politics at Yale. “Most things the 
government provides you today are 
based on qualities that move with 
you when you move. Your family 
income, for example, is going to 
determine whether you get a welfare 
check or whether your children get 
free lunch at school.” Horan says 
subsidized housing is unique in that 
the government is pointing to a 
specific area on a map that it wants to 
improve. The Housing Authority has 
to consider how that area fits into and 
affects the city as a whole.


In making these choices, HANH 
is limited by what it can afford to 
build and refurbish. This makes for 
slow work. Because public housing 
developments have gone so famously 
wrong in the past, this work is also 
highly scrutinized by the neighbors. 
Monterey Place was built fourteen 
years ago. Is it working today? 
“It’s tricky to say whether public 
housing works or not, because there 
are no across-the-board metrics,” 
says Paul Bass, editor of the New 
Haven Independent. Having covered 
Connecticut for over thirty years, Bass 
has seen many New Haven projects 
come and go. As a first measure, 
he suggests comparing crime rates 
before and after a development 
is redone. Secondly, how has the 
appearance of the place changed? 
And most difficult to measure, but 
of towering importance, is whether 
those 
theoretically 
transformative 
relationships between low- and high-
income tenants is occurring: “Are 
neighbors friends if their backyards 
are connected?” 


A 2003 Yale Law Review article 
pointed 
out 
that 
the 
Dixwell 
neighborhood had indeed become 
safer since the development of 
Monterey Place, and that there was a 
waiting list to live in both the market-
rate and the subsidized units.  Past 
HANH head Robert Solomon is 
generally satisfied with the project, 
but he says there is has an important 
drawback to keep in mind. Because 
the project spread out the affordable 
units, they became fewer in number 
overall: “You’re always looking for 
ways to create more units. Always, 
when the need is so high.”


Putting 
aside 
generally 
positive numerical indicators about 
the quality of life in Monterey Place, 
there has certainly been a change in 
the way residents relate to each other. 
But it’s a little more complicated than 
whether neighbors become friends. 
A
s Allick remembers it, Elm 
Haven began with the premise 
that “if you can’t get a job, you can 
always hustle in the projects, and 
everybody had your back.”  Mentally, 
he says it was very hard to justify 
stepping out of this culture, and “the 
body follow the mind.” Now both 
Allick and Gallman have stepped out: 
they mentor juvenile offenders at the 
state-funded Juvenile Review Board, 
and Allick gives talks at Dixwell-area 
Hillhouse High School encouraging 
kids to choose alternative paths from 
joining the traffic. 


Allick says the culture in his 
old neighborhood has changed in 
that “now, with the new project, it’s 
responsibility time. You gotta go out 
there, get a job. You gotta step outside 
the box, and a lot of people can’t step 
outside the box.” Because of their old 
habits, many of the residents of the 
Elm Haven were not allowed to move 
into new homes in Monterey Place. 
There were several police inspections 
of Elm Haven homes right before 
its demolition, and “if your house 
got raided and they found drugs, 
you couldn’t come back and live over 
here,” Allick says. “It happened to a 
lot of people.”


This is when Allick and Gallman 
first point out a downside to the 
changes in the neighborhood: “It 
broke everyone up,” says Allick. 
“We’re not able to see each other like 
we used to see each other, like every 
day. Now they all claim to be from 
another project, and they act funny 
when they see each other.”


We drive by two closed buildings 
that the navigators point to as losses 
for the community. The first is their 
“hood club,” for which Allick gives 
me a different name depending on 
which year I ask him about: it was 
either Cardinals, the Dirty Bird, 
Butta J’s, or Red Café. It resembles a 
cement block. The second place is a 
community center called the Dixwell 
Q House, which Gallman says “was 
like a father figure to many.”


“They had sports there—football, 
basketball,” says Allick. “We could go 
there for recreation. There were arts 
and crafts and a ping-pong table, and 
dances at night for the community. 
Now people are fighting for it to open 
back up. There is a petition, and even 
the alderman is on board.” 


Most of all, Allick seems to miss 
knowing everyone. We drive into the 
neighborhood to the south and he 
explains that the Tribe was friends with 
the group in this community, called 
the Tre. These are neighborhood 
groups, not gangs, Allick maintains, 
but still “if you was from the Tre, and 
you shot someone from the Tribe, we 
would retaliate. If they shot one of 
our boys, we would go back and shoot 
one of their boys.”  


Labels carry heavy weight in 
these situations. The New Haven 
Police Department has used the term 
“gang” in association with violence 
in the Tribe, but Allick maintains that 
these were simply personal beefs, and 
that current neighborhood groups 
are different from older New Haven 
gangs and national gangs like the 
Latin Kings that have been edging in 
recently. “Bloods and Grape Street—
that’s not from here; that’s California 
stuff.” 


We’re headed for the Tre now,
