“Where do the birds fit in? 
They’re an indicator for understanding 
land use,” said Julie Newman, the 
office’s director. The fluctuation in 
bird populations on campus can help 
us understand what Yale is doing right 
and what it’s doing wrong when it 
comes to New Haven’s urban ecology. 
Heiser refers to the information we 
will be collecting as “baseline data,” a 
large body of statistics that will allow 
the Peabody to look for anomalies. 
After all, you can’t know if something 
is wrong in the environment unless 
you know what’s normal.


Using 
citizen 
scientists 
to 
produce baseline data is nothing 
new. Thoreau meticulously observed 
the asters in his garden in Concord, 
Massachusetts, between 1851 and 
1858, and wrote down when each 
flower bloomed, noting changes 
each year. When a team of scientists 
discovered Thoreau’s unpublished 
records, they realized they were full 
of valuable baseline climate data—the 
timing of plant flowering is closely 
tied to temperature. In a February 
2012 article in the journal BioScience, 
this team showed that plants are now 
flowering ten days earlier in Concord 
than they were in Thoreau’s time. 
They used his data to suggest that the 
temperature in Concord increased by 
4.32 degrees Fahrenheit.


Aside 
from 
leading 
bird 
walks, 
Sirch 
is 
also 
organizing 
and participating in the Peabody’s 
FrogWatch program, which has citizen 
scientists collect baseline data on 
frog populations. You arrive at your 
designated wetland a half hour after 
sunset, wait for two minutes so that 
the frogs aren’t frightened by any noise 
you might have made, and then spend 
three minutes listening. You can hear 
the spring peeper’s chirp, “the three-
minute-long high trill of the American 
toad, the snore of the pickerel frog,” 
Sirch told me. The idea is that the frog 
watcher has some fun while helping 
scientists establish normal figures for 
local frog populations and habitat 
health. 


But “normal” can’t accurately 
describe a lot of ecological systems 
today. When Heiser asked if anyone 
had seen any spring warblers last 
year, a lady in the front row raised 
her hand. “Dead,” she said. “That 
itself is important information to 
know,” Heiser said. While there are 
many similarities between the hordes 
of self-trained naturalists of the 
nineteenth-century and the boom in 
citizen science today, the pressures of 
the environment have intensified. 


The university is “exploding 
campus with all these new buildings,” 
Julie Newman says. So, she poses, how 
can we make an argument for green 
space and prove that we need it? One 
argument could draw strong evidence 
from the large number of warblers 
that stop here on their migratory 
routes. Although Heiser insists that 
theirs is not an advocacy mission, he 
acknowledges that the research could 
have a great ecological impact. Many 
of these species can act as a campus 
bellwether, helping the university 
understand what it is doing to the 
ecosystems within which it is located. 


Besides 
informing 
the 
administration’s 
expansion 
effort, 
the citizen science research program 
has other benefits. It opens a door to 
experiencing wonder in the natural 
world. As E. O. Wilson wrote in his 
1984 book Biophilia:
To the extent that each person can 
feel like a naturalist, the old excitement of  
the untrammeled world will be regained. I 
offer this as a formula of  reenchantment to 
invigorate poetry and myth: mysterious and 
little known organisms live within walking 
distance of  where you sit. Splendor awaits in 
minute proportions.

Citizen science may work as a 
data-collecting tool, but it also builds 
connections between man and other 
species. And isn’t learning the name 
of the blackburnian warbler or a 
yellow-bellied sapsucker the first step 
to caring whether it lives or dies?



**Title: Apocalypse Now?**

Apocalypse Now?
A painting of a dark apocalyptic 
landscape, 
John 
Martin’s 
1835 
Destruction of  the Cities of  the Plain, hangs 
in Michael Coe’s East Rock living 
room. The Yale professor emeritus 
of anthropology, still sprightly in his 
eighties, blinked up at it. 
The 
bright-eyed, 
gray-haired 
professor pulled from one bookshelf 
an 1827 print of Paradise Lost illustrated 
with 
mezzotints. 
“You 
could buy these for a song back in 
the sixties,” he said. Images of the 
apocalypse recur in Coe’s life. “I 
went to a church school and I’ve read 
through the Bible twice, including 
the Book of Revelations,” he said. “I 
don’t believe any of it now, but that 
certainly influenced me.” He laughed, 
but then added, “The Maya probably 
thought in very similar ways.”
Coe was the first to suggest that 
the ancient Mesoamerican civilization 
had predicted that the world would 
end in 2012. His analysis ignited a

before the cycle begins again. This 
December 23 will mark the end of a 
single b’ak’tun, but not a piktun, she 
said. 
And, 
Maxwell 
added, 
some 
Mayan descendants who have revived 
their ancestors’ calendar will actually 
spend December 23 celebrating the 
end of the b’ak’tun. All of which raises 
the question: is fear of the Mayan 
Apocalypse even Mayan at all—or is 
it American?
Books, movies, and late-night 
television have all capitalized on the 
Mayan Apocalypse. “First, the Mayan 
calendar predicted it. Now, science has 
confirmed it. But we never imagined 
it could really happen,” ran the tagline 
for the Sony/Columbia movie 2012 
(released in 2009), which grossed 
almost $800 million worldwide. The 
film was inspired by British writer 
Graham Hancock’s 1995 book The 
Fingerprints of  the Gods, which draws on 
ancient Mayan myth and astronomy to 
predict a coming global environmental 
catastrophe. The Fingerprints of  the Gods 
has been translated into twenty-seven 
languages and has sold about three 
continuing debate in academic circles 
and provided popular culture with a 
new fixation. In his seminal book The 
Maya, published in 1966, he directed 
attention to Monument 6, a stone in 
Tortuguero, Mexico, whose face is 
marked with a Mayan noun, a verb, 
a subject, and a date. Monument 
6 describes the prophecy and its 
appointed date of fulfillment—Dec. 
23, 2012.
The noun on Monument 6 is the 
name of a god. The deity also appears 
on a vase that depicts all the Mayan 
gods meeting in darkness at the 
creation of the current world, which 
makes Coe think it is has something to 
do with the end of the world. “I think 
this god is associated with cataclysm,” 
he says. Though the verb isn’t entirely 
legible, Coe maintains that it translates 
to “will descend.” 
 “The Mayans would have been 
worried!” Coe said, smiling earnestly. 
The Mayans believed that the world 
had been created and destroyed 
multiple times. Violent Mayan myths 
of creation and destruction tell how 
past worlds have been destroyed by 
giant jaguars, wind, fire, and flood. 
Their calendar starts on Aug. 13, 3114 
B.C.E., when, according to Mayan 
tradition, this world was first created. 
Since then, twelve cycles of roughly 
four hundred years, or b’ak’tuns, have 
passed. December 23 is the final day 
of the thirteenth and current b’ak’tun.
But 
Coe’s 
reading 
of 
the 
monument 
is 
not 
universally 
accepted by his fellow academic 
Mayanists. 
Gerardo 
Aldana, 
an 
associate professor at University of 
California, Santa Barbara, who studies 
Mayan 
hieroglyphic 
history 
and 
Mesoamerican art, said that he doesn’t 
believe the Mayans thought the end 
of every thirteenth b’ak’tun would be 
a cataclysmic event. He agreed with 
Judith Maxwell, an anthropologist 
at Tulane University, who said that 
twenty b’ak’tuns—which constitute 
a piktun, a larger cycle—must pass 
Clare Randt
million copies worldwide. The idea 
that 2012 might spell doom has found 
a home in the popular American 
consciousness.  
Coe points out that Americans 
have long been preoccupied with the 
apocalypse. Themes of mass death 
and earthly destruction can be found 
in the theology of religious sects 
like the Millerites, who eventually 
became the Seventh Day Adventists, 
and events like 2011’s “rapture 
hour,” when an American Christian 
radio host’s end-of-world prediction 
went viral. Apocalypse anxieties also 
underlined Cold War nuclear threats 
and fears of global environmental 
collapse. “I think it’s in the American 
mind,” Coe said. 
If he is right, then the debate 
over this December 23 does not say as 
much about Mayan culture as it does 
about our own.
