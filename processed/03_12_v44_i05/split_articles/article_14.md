in philosophy, I still doubted whether 
experimental 
philosophy 
could 
meaningfully be called philosophy 
at all. Experimental philosophers 
like Knobe argue that keeping big 
questions out of labs and away from 
data confines the discipline to a narrow 
space. The debate about experimental 
philosophy deals with these questions: 
what is philosophy, what should it be, 
and who are these people who think 
they can change it?


I 
made my way into a dimly lit 
seminar room, choosing a seat out 
of the way and in the corner. I had 
come to visit Knobe’s lab meeting, and 
I was late. A graduate student with a 
faint southern drawl was presenting at 
the front of the room. Someone from 
the back called out a suggestion about 
research methods, another disagreed, 
and the discussion grew somewhat 
heated before Knobe calmed them 
down, laughing. 
“Friends, I’m afraid we must 
move on,” he said soothingly. His 
voice was high-pitched and fluid, and 
seemed to invite me along to discover 
deep truths along with him. Knobe’s 
hair is dark and shaggy, and he wore a 
striped gray t-shirt with faded brown 
corduroy pants.


As the lab meeting came to a 
close, I approached Knobe, hoping 
to hear more about experimental 
philosophy and its place at Yale. 
“Sure.” he said. “Do you want to grab 
a burrito?” I did. I was starving, and I 
love burritos. 


If experimental philosophy is 
a revolution, then it’s a “very mild-
mannered” one, Knobe assured me 
as we ate at Moe’s Southwest Grill 
on Whitney Avenue (his choice). 
I find it hard to imagine Knobe 
as a revolutionary but, then again, 
the symbol of his movement is a 
flaming armchair. It serves as an 
omen, suggesting that neuroscience 
and psychology could replace the 
introspection in answering questions 
about human nature. 


In 
2006, 
Slate 
magazine 
profiled recent work in experimental 
philosophy. The article went largely 
unnoticed by the average reader, but 
it caused some controversy in the 
world of academic philosophy. David 
Velleman, a philosopher at New York 
University, responded in a blog post, 
arguing that experimental philosophy 
has no bearing on any philosophical 
problems. Other philosophers rushed 
to defend Knobe and his colleagues, 
and the sudden attention led Oxford 
University Press to approach the Yale 
professor in a matter of days, asking 
him to co-edit a volume of research 
in the field. “A bunch of people at the 
same time were doing the same kind 
of thing,” he explained. “There was 
this convergence.” 


Knobe came to Yale when 
a faculty position opened in the 
cognitive science program, which 
proved particularly well-suited to 
Knobe’s interdisciplinary work. Knobe 
has written papers on varied topics, 
including free will and cosmology, and 
a recent paper he co-authored with 
Yale psychologist Paul Bloom explored 
how people’s clothes influence what 
we think about their capability to feel 
pain or plan ahead. If it weren’t for 
Knobe’s hiring, Yale’s small band of 
experimental philosophers might not 
exist today, and certainly wouldn’t 
exist in its current capacity. 


After a brief stint travelling 
through Europe to translate “really 
terrible” Russian poetry, Jonathan 
Phillips, a graduate student pursuing 
a joint PhD in psychology and 
philosophy followed Knobe to Yale, 
working first as the professor’s lab 
manager, then as his graduate student.  
Phillips studied philosophy at 
the University of North Carolina at 
Chapel Hill when Knobe was still a 
professor there. He had begun to feel 
disillusioned with modern philosophy 
(“I thought, ‘This is just all bullshit’”), 
and so was relieved to discover that 
Knobe shared some of his concerns. 
“I had already actually started the 
process to switch to take extra time 
in college to go to medical school—
basically to do something useful with 
my life,” he said, laughing. Knobe 
convinced him to pursue experimental 
philosophy instead. 


Eric Mandelbaum, a postdoctoral 
fellow and lecturer in Yale’s philosophy 
department, also moved with Knobe 
from Chapel Hill to Yale. Though 
Mandelbaum 
considers 
himself 
more of a theoretical psychologist 
than an experimental philosopher, he 
shares an interest in the fundamental 
questions of human nature. 
“I want to know the way the 
fucking mind works,” Mandelbaum 
told me in the basement of Anna 
Liffey’s, in between sips of Guinness. 
He had invited me to have drinks after 
one of Knobe’s lab meetings.


Mandelbaum wore a collared 
shirt under a tight black hoodie, and 
he glowed with what I think of as 
the endearing and somehow earnest 
cynicism of an artist. He was, indeed, 
a writer and used to play music. His 
face lit red every so often as the LED 
at the end of his electronic cigarette 
flared up, and he mentioned that he’d 
recently quit smoking after seventeen 
years. I laughed, and mentioned
