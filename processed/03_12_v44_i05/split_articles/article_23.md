“So this is called ‘the G,’ which is 
short for the Ghetto,” Allick begins. 
“I couldn’t tell you why they call it 
that. But these are the worst projects 
in New Haven. Even though they 
remodeled them about four, five years 
ago, they are still projects. A lot of 
illegal activity still takes place around 
here.” 

Allick would know. He says he 
is allowed over here because of his 
history of hustling. “I know everybody 
from everywhere. If we was talking on 
the phone, I could figure out where 
you at according to what projects you 
was in. ‘Oh, you was in the Hill? The 
Island? The Ville? The Tribe?’ ” 

The Tribe’s physical frame has 
been remodeled into Monterey Place 
for thirteen years now, time enough to 
check back in about the culture of the 
area. By spending time with Allick and 
Gallman, I hoped to find out what the 
culture had changed from, and what it 
was changing into.   

“So our buildings were like this, 
“Now, with the 
new project, it’s 
responsibility time. 
You gotta go out 
there, get a job. You 
gotta step outside 
the box, and a lot 
of people can’t step 
outside the box.”
transactions, and relationships. We 
tend to veer toward what we value in 
the place, in the hope that others will 
see that as well. 

I met Hugh “HG” Gallman 
and Darrell Allick through a fellow 
student who got to know them while 
researching the New Haven rap scene. 
Through their tour, Allick wanted 
to show me what they valued in the 
Dixwell area of New Haven, known 
to them as The Tribe, and how 
it had changed since they grew 
up there. Eager to hear their 
perspective, I got in the back of 
their sedan. 

“T
he Tribe” refers to the 
community that grew up 
in the Elm Haven housing project 
on Dixwell Avenue between 
Webster and Bristol Streets. 
At the time of its demolition, 
the Elm Haven was the oldest 
public housing in New Haven. 
It made way for a development 
called Monterey Place, a mixed-
income housing community that 
abuts Yale’s campus just past 
the police station and health 
center. Like all mixed-income 
housing, Monterey Place is a 
social experiment; theoretically, 
interspersing market-rate homes 
with 
government-subsidized 
homes would dilute the culture itself 
of poverty and promote more positive 
values in the community.  

After he picks me up on the 
northeast corner of Yale’s campus, 
Gallman doesn’t drive straight to the 
Tribe. To help me understand what 
his area used to be like, he is driving 
us to another part of town, heading 
east down Grand Avenue toward the 
neighborhood of Fair Haven. We turn 
left down Franklin Street and begin to 
encircle a group of red brick, three-
story buildings called Farnam Courts. 
At the front of the development, there 
is a busy playground of parents and 
children. At the back, there is a long 
but worse,” Allick continues, pointing 
in the G. “Dirty, nasty, filthy. That’s 
how it was back in ’88, ’90. And our 
high-rises were twelve stories instead 
of three, like you see here. Remember 
this.”

When we are done in Fair Haven, 
we reverse course back toward 
downtown New Haven, pass it, and 
turn up Dixwell. The sign announcing 
“Monterey Place,” with a perky “y” 
styled to look like a musical 
note, appears freshly painted. 
So do the wood-paneled homes 
behind grassy lawns. They are 
all 
professionally 
landscaped. 
If Farnam Courts is The Wire, 
Monterey Place is The Stepford 
Wives.

M
onterey Place was designed 
in the mid-nineties by the 
Housing Authority of the City of 
New Haven (HANH), the local 
arm of the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development 
(HUD). The Elm Haven high-
rises had been demolished in 
1991. It took seven years for the 
construction of low-rise, garden-
style apartments and townhomes 
in their place. The majority of 
these homes are designed for one 
family. Only some are subsidized. 
Management of the property was 
transferred to a private real estate firm, 
and Monterey Place was inaugurated.  

The Housing Authority, which 
remains responsible for overseeing 
around three thousand housing units 
and over three thousand Section 
8 Housing vouchers, offers rent-
assistance for low-income families. 
HANH is the largest landlord in the 
city. It also has the tricky mandate 
of strategically adding or relocating 
government-subsidized housing units 
where it sees fit.
