that he was either way older than he 
looked, or he started smoking when 
he was a baby. “A little bit of both,” 
he replied, grinning. I imagined him as 
a skinny-jeaned fifteen year-old with 
shaggy hair, taking a smoke break 
from band practice behind his friend’s 
garage. It seemed plausible.

For a brief period, Mandelbaum 
had also pursued a PhD in psychology, 
but he found that philosophy provided 
him more time and freedom to pursue 
his interests, as he no longer needed 
to spend his time collecting data. 
“Anyone can collect the data,” he told 
me, grinning some more.

As a waitress took Mandelbaum’s 
order, he mentioned that as a graduate 
student in the department where 
Knobe had his first job, he was in 
a privileged position to observe 
Knobe’s career. Mandelbaum and 
another graduate student had rallied 
to get him hired at Chapel Hill. The 
academics have since become friends.

“When his book came out, he 
suckered me into opening for his wife 
in a split indie rock/academic talk 
setting,” Mandelbaum said. Knobe’s 
wife, 
an 
indie 
singer-songwriter, 
played a set, and Mandelbaum, he 
admitted, “got a little bit tipsy and 
gave a talk called ‘Why is everyone 
such an asshole?’” 

Yale’s community of experimental 
philosophers is somewhat unique. 
Outside 
of 
Harvard, 
where 
Mandelbaum will work next year, 
and a handful of smaller philosophy 
programs such as City University 
of New York and the University of 
Arizona, 
philosophy 
departments 
with an interest in cognitive sciences 
are few and far between. “In my 
depressed moods, it makes me just 
wanna go open a record store,”

Timothy Dwight College.
Mandelbaum said, laughing. But he 
noted that cognitive science centers 
were beginning to be more common 
in Europe. “Sad to think that that 
might be where the future is, because 
the structures here are just not set 
up to move easily.” It seems that not 
many universities may be open to 
philosophical revolutions.

N
ot everyone at Yale is convinced 
that experimental philosophy 
can provide answers to the eternal 
questions 
philosophy. 
Clark 
Professor 
Philosophy 
Shelly 
Kagan expressed skepticism that 
experimental philosophy would be 
any more successful than previous, 
ultimately 
failed 
philosophical 
revolutions. Yet Kagan embraced the 
project nonetheless. It’s difficult to 
tell in advance which philosophical 
projects will pay off. 

“Let a thousand flowers bloom,” 
Kagan told me. 

Whether or not experimental 
makes 
significant 
contributions to the philosophical 
canon, Kagan sees it at as relevant for 
the cognitive sciences. “I’m personally 
inclined to think that this stuff is 
primarily a subfield of psychology,” he 
added. And I realized that, consciously 
or not, I had also been treating the 
research coming from experimental 
philosophy as part of psychology. 

I found myself still in a strange 
place—I was interested in philosophy 
the way Kagan and other modern 
philosophers understood it, but also 
as Knobe and other experimental 
philosophers understood it. I had 
trouble clearly locating my interests in 
philosophy or psychology, and I still 
couldn’t precisely define philosophy. 
But perhaps it didn’t and doesn’t really 
matter. Knobe told me, “I think it 
would be great if we could just go after 
questions with everything we can, and 
not worry about distinctions.” I think 
he’s right.

A few weeks later I sat in a leather 
sofa across from Professor Bloom, 
whose psychological research touches 
on philosophical issues. Floor-to-
ceiling bookshelves peppered with a 
few bits of cognitive esoterica stood 
behind us. His arm swung casually 
over the edge of his chair while a 
colorful and rectangular clay mug 
stood on the floor at the other side of 
the room. 

Bloom 
represents 
the 
psychologist who deals in deep 
questions of human nature without 
being too concerned about calling it 
philosophy. He was a great admirer of 
thinkers like David Hume and Adam 
Smith and sees philosophers like 
Knobe as following in their footsteps. 
Sitting up in his chair and smiling, 
Bloom added, “If Ada­m Smith was 
around today he’d have a lab.” He 
seemed clearly delighted by the idea, 
and I think I was, too.
