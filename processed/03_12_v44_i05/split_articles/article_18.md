pardon she received saved her life. “It 
means a wonder to have a pardon, it 
means I can start my life over with a 
clean slate,” she tells me over pizza. 
“My son, my daughter, my four 
grandkids, they’re all so proud of me” 
It’s been easier to get jobs, too, since 
employers no longer reject her after 
completing a background check.
It’s been thirteen years since 
Downing stopped selling crack. She 
now works as a crossing guard in New 
Haven, and sells homemade pies on 
the side. In some ways, she says her 
pie-baking business fills the void left 
when she stopped selling drugs. She 
often sells pies to her friends when 
they stop by her house. 
Downing seems to be proof that 
people really can change, and that 
makes me feel good. But then I ask 
her if having a pardon means she’ll 
never return to her criminal ways. 
“I’m trying to stay away from 
that for sure. These days I do my 
baking, I belong to a church, I’m 
trying to straighten my life out,” she 
says. Then, she adds a surprising 
concession: “You know, sometimes 
I am tempted to go back into selling 
drugs. Hopefully I won’t, but hey, we 
all have our personal hang-ups.” 
“What’s the sense in getting a 
pardon if you’ll go back on your 
word?” she adds, and I’m quick to 
agree. But perhaps the ease with 
which a pardon permits a felon to 
deceive explains why, despite how nice 
Downing seems, much of society may 
be uneasy with the notion of legal 
pardons. Criminal records serve a 
purpose: they provide warning signs to 
society to watch for recidivists. Some 
convicts who apply for pardons have 
physically assaulted people, and some 
have killed. Last year, the state of 
Connecticut pardoned four hundred 
three formerly convicted felons; that’s 
four hundred three people who can 
legally say they never committed the 
crime for which they once were found 
guilty. 
T
irzah Kemp, who helps people 
like Downing apply for pardons, 
has three appointments scheduled 
before her lunch break. One is with 
a man who holds a double homicide 
conviction, and two are with men 
who were arrested for possession of a 
firearm. It’s the beginning of a typical 
Thursday morning.
Tirzah, known to her friends as 
“Tee,” works in a small office tucked 
away on the second floor of New 
Haven’s City Hall. There, she works 
for the city’s Prison Reentry Initiative, 
a program launched in 2008 to offer 
resources and advice to formerly 
incarcerated residents — “everything 
from where to buy bus passes to how 
to draft a resume,” Kemp likes to 
say. Kemp’s work puts her in a good 
position to help ease societal concerns 
about pardons. 
Kemp is the typical social worker: 
friendly, motherly, efficient. She takes 
care to ask clients if they’ve spoken 
to their parents, if they have enough 
food stamps, whether or not they’re 
happy. 
Her office is covered with posters 
that encourage felons to vote or apply 
for housing or claim their civil rights. 
She grins when she tells me — as she 
often does — about clients of hers 
who have gone on to find gainful 
employment and turn their lives 
around.
In short, she seems born for this 
job. But until roughly a decade ago, 
she had never heard of it.
“I started working here after I got 
my felony,” she tells me the first time 
we meet. The public record will tell 
you that on September 6, 1999, she 
was convicted for assault in the second 
degree after stabbing her ex-boyfriend 
with a knife. She will add that it was 
the result of a short, tumultuous 
relationship that often turned violent.
Before her arrest, she’d never 
thought about felons or the lives 
they lead. But then came her charge 
and soon after, the three years on 
V
irginia Downing, 61, can 
legally 
say 
she’s 
never 
committed a crime.
Search 
“Virginia 
Downing” 
on any database of court records, 
and you’ll get nothing. Her record is 
spotless, indistinguishable from that 
of the most average, law-abiding 
citizen.
Yet ask her, and she’ll tell you 
that she’s been arrested “three or 
four times” in Fair Haven. She began 
cooking and selling crack in the early 
1990s, when she was bored and 
unemployed. Her friends would come 
to her apartment after work, begging 
her to supply them. “Idle hands are 
the devil’s workshop,” she intones. 
She sighs, accentuating the wrinkles 
on her weathered face. 
The last time Downing was 
arrested, in 1998, the police officer 
said to her, “Mrs. Downing, could 
you please find something else to 
do?” That’s when she realized she’d 
had enough. “They never found any 
guns on me or anything. I didn’t open 
my house for that,” she says. “I just 
wanted company. But it just wasn’t 
worth it anymore.”
The secret to her clean public 
record? She was pardoned.
In 2008, Connecticut removed 
Downing’s 
criminal 
conviction 
records from public view. A previously 
convicted felon may apply for a 
Connecticut state-issued pardon five 
years after committing a felony or 
three years after a misdemeanor. 
Downing spent the five years 
after her conviction getting clean, 
working at Krispy Kreme and Olive 
Garden, and volunteering at Mothers 
for Justice, an advocacy group for low-
income women. From her sobriety, 
employment, and community service 
work, she built a pardon application 
that stressed how the woman she 
had become was different from the 
one who once illegally sold drugs and 
alcohol. 
To hear Downing tell it, the
