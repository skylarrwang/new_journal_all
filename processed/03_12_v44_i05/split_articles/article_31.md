brought them there or what it was like 
for them.
TNJ: What do you think about 
the idea that there are two 
different schools of  writers and 
journalists now —  the kind that 
likes technology and the kind that 
doesn’t like putting a personality 
online?
SS: As a journalist today, you’re 
expected to put yourself in the 
public sphere and feel comfortable 
participating 
in 
instantaneous 
debates and conversation, in a way 
that wouldn’t have been possible ten 
years ago. That’s really exciting and 
energizing in a lot of ways, to be able to 
be in touch with one’s readership and 
get immediate feedback and engage. 
But I think it also runs counter to a 
lot of what draws me to journalism. 
I’ve never felt particularly articulate 
off the cuff, and I really appreciate 
the time to choose my words carefully. 
The translation process between what 
is going on in my head and what is 
coming out of my mouth is never 
happening at 100 percent or even 70 
percent efficiency. So being able to 
spend time calibrating my words is 
useful.
TNJ: Does it feel like there is a 
stronger population of  tech-savyy 
journalists now?
SS: I think so, because a lot of 
publications really want you to be 
a part of it. Even writers that are 
resistant, like the Jonathan Franzens 
of the world, have reluctantly resigned 
themselves to the fact that every now 
and then they may find themselves 
participating in a videocast or a live 
author chat.
TNJ: Do you think the place for 
long-form journalism is changing?
SS: I’m so excited about some of 
the new platforms that are providing 
journalists 
with 
the 
opportunity 
to try out hypertextual modes of 
storytelling. Places like The Atavist 
where people are experimenting with 
integrating audio and visuals into the 
arc of a longform story. There are 
some unbelievable new opportunities 
for thinking about how we tell stories 
creatively. 
TNJ: 
Do 
you 
see 
yourself  
integrating multimedia into your 
pieces in the future?
SS: Multimedia offers some new 
tools, I think, for getting out of your 
own way as a narrator. You’ll always 
have the complication of being the 
person who’s editing things down and 
choosing what parts of someone’s own 
self-presentation make it out there. 
But multimedia allows for a degree 
of immediacy that wasn’t available to 
storytellers before. It’s like creating a 
direct line between sources and reader. 
I’m such a Luddite in a lot of ways 
but I’m trying to embrace these new 
vehicles, partly because I think they’re 
interesting and meaningful. 
What 
has 
been 
most 
embarrassing in your career?
SS: I’ve written a lot of things that 
make me cringe. It’s so complicated 
that for young writers on college 
campuses now, no one has the 
opportunity to learn in private, 
because of the Internet. Part of 
learning to be a journalist these days 
is learning to accept the fact that your 
opinions will change over the course 
of your lifetime and you have to feel 
comfortable recognizing that your 
thoughts are evolving. Yet another 
reason why it’s good to have a great 
editor.
