probation, the inevitable questions 
from her kids, the public stigma, the 
drawn-out job search. “But I always 
had a passion for helping people,” 
she’ll tell you. “I always tell people I 
didn’t choose to work with former 
offenders as a career path, it kind of 
chose me.”
A former felon herself, Kemp 
empathizes with her clients. But if 
Kemp stands at the pearly gates, 
helping some to get pardons and 
start anew, she also wants the chance 
to enter. For this reason, she decided 
in 2009 to begin her own pardon 
application. 

when I first contacted Amy 
Meek, Kemp’s colleague and 
the Reentry Initiative director, she did 
not want to talk to me about pardons.
“Advocates in the area of 
prisoner reentry really struggle with 
the press,” she told me over a phone 
call. “The fundamental issue is there is 
a lot of stigma associated with having 
a criminal conviction, sometimes with 
good reason, sometimes not.” Some 
reporters write about “ex-cons” or 
“felons,” unaware that these terms 
pigeonhole those trying to move 
on with their lives. Many don’t do 
background research. Most were 
probably brought up to believe that 
once someone becomes a criminal, 
they will always be one.

It 
is 
this 
perception 
that 
Amy fears. “The media too often 
stereotypes what someone looks like 
who has a criminal conviction. There’s 
an idea that they are a bunch of big, 
bad guys. But it’s estimated that nearly 
one in every four adults has a criminal 
conviction. So it’s not just about bad 
guys.” 

She’s right: according to a 
March 2011 study by the National 
Employment Law Project, nearly 
sixty-five million Americans have 
some sort of criminal record. That’s 
about a fifth of the population of the 
United States.

we’re 
on 
Kemp’s 
second 
appointment of the day, a 
twenty-eight-year-old 
black 
man 
named Smith Smith. He was convicted 
in 2009 for carrying a firearm and was 
released from jail this past January, on 
parole until this July. He’s here to work 
on his resume. 

Kemp sees a lot of people 
like Smith, who ask about resumes 
and job searches. Getting a job is 
difficult for anyone in this recessed 
economy, but for a convicted felon, 
it is nearly impossible. On top of 
this, the advocacy non-governmental 
organization Human Rights Watch 
estimated that nearly 3.5 million 
Americans are ineligible for federal 
housing based on their criminal 
records. 

Unsurprisingly, 
many 
are forced into homelessness and 
debilitating poverty — conditions 
that inspire some to return to a life of 
crime.

I 
ask 
Smith 
what 
he’ll 
do 
if 
his 
criminal 
conviction 
bars him from getting a job.
“I mean right now, I need money,” he 
says. “In the future I want to further 
my education and stuff. I don’t have 
much family support. I’ve never been 
a person who got into trouble, but 
I was caught at the wrong time. It’s 
always been hard to get jobs, but by 
having this big felony on me it’s going 
to be really hard. I know that.”

At this point Kemp interjects and 
asks me if I’ve read The New Jim Crow, 
a book by American Civil Liberties 
Union attorney Michelle Alexander. I 
haven’t.
“Read it. This is a perfect example 
of what she’s talking about,” she says 
gesturing towards Smith. “You have a 
black gentleman who made a very, very 
poor decision, no doubt. Rather than 
him getting an education or changing 
his behavior, he was incarcerated. 
The warehouse of his mind was not 
cultivated. And he’s coming home 
with the same mental behavior, if not 
more angry, and now the system will

not allow him to right his wrong.”

Smith, who seems not to have 
thought about his conviction in those 
terms before, seems a bit taken aback. 
He is straight out of jail, quick to 
laugh, still optimistic that he can get 
his life back. He keeps telling me that 
he’s sure he’ll get a job.

Kemp joins in. “I didn’t realize 
how difficult it would be when I got 
my felony either,” she says. She had 
a job at that point and maintained 
her employment. But then she had 
her second son and took some time 
off. When she began searching for a 
new job, things were different. 

These days, employers can look 
up everything online, and even 
a cursory background check 
reveals her second-degree assault. 
They saw her felony, she said, 
and assumed she was prone to 
violence. Kemp thinks that few 
looked past her criminal record.

She stops typing up his 
resume for a moment to do a 
quick Google search for job 
openings. She has a point to 
make. “Look, here’s one.” It’s 
for kitchen maintenance work, 
a dishwasher. “You must have some 
experience in the kitchen,” she reads. 
“You must be able to pass a criminal 
background check.” She laughs at the 
requirement as if it were obviously 
absurd. For a moment, I wonder 
what’s so ludicrous: if I were working 
in a kitchen, I’d want some confidence 
that the dishwasher wasn’t a murderer. 
But then I realize the sort of criminal 
record Kemp means is probably 
something like possessing marijuana 
fifteen years ago — not the kind of 
crime that would put me or anybody 
else in our kitchen at risk. New Haven’s 
Board of Alderman have recently been 
thinking along similar lines as Kemp, 
voting on April 2 to make it easier for 
former felons to obtain street vendor 
licenses from the city. The Collateral 
Consequences Ordinance should help 
the one in seven applicants for street 
vendors licenses in New Haven who 
have been turned away because of 
their criminal records.

Kemp continues, it’s not that 
people with criminal records can’t 
get jobs. They can. They just have to 
know how to market themselves.

That’s where she can be of most 
help. There are certain tricks of the 
trade. She tells her clients that when 
an employer asks about their records, 
they should first explain that they 
regret their past actions and have 
learned from their mistakes. Then 
they should list all of the positive 
efforts they’ve made since then to 
reintegrate into the community. It’s a 
science: after they’ve established that 
they take full responsibility for their 
actions, they draw the employers’ 
attention away from their crimes and 
onto their progress.

Smith asks if she can write that 
down for him, and they both laugh. 
Start studying tonight, she jokes. Then 
she’s serious again: “Right now your 
record outweighs your skills. But with 
the correct marketing, it can be the 
opposite. I feel frustrated when guys 
come to me and say no one’s going 
to hire me because of my record. I’ve 
been doing this ten years now, and I 
don’t believe that’s true.”

She prints out his completed 
resume and continues searching for 
jobs online. Voila! A Connecticut 
company is looking for a truck tire 
changer. A valid driver’s license is the 
only requirement. She prints this out 
for him as well. We’re at the end of his 
appointment.
“Good luck,” I say to Smith as he 
puts his resume in his bag and gets up 
to leave.
“I need it,” he replies.

We’ve 
gone 
the 
whole 
conversation without bringing up one 
crucial fact: everything comes back to 
the pardon.

With a pardon, people like Smith 
don’t have to worry about employers 
conducting background checks. They 
don’t have to worry about being 
stopped at international borders. 
They don’t have to hedge when 
someone asks their criminal 
history.

Pardons 
can 
sometimes 
seem like an elusive holy grail. 
But where do they actually come 
from? While pardons can feel like 
the touch of Grace, gratuitous 
and redeeming, they are in fact 
doled out by the human hands of 
Connecticut state employees. 

only a short distance from 
the Waterbury train station 
lies a large, gray circular building, 
home to the Connecticut Board of 
Pardons and Paroles. Here, a board 
of eight reads and evaluates each 
pardon application. Here, the fate of 
people like Kemp and Smith hangs in 
the balance. Last year, nine hundred 
twenty-five 
people 
applied 
for 
pardons. Slightly more than one-third 
of these were granted.

On the fifth floor near the 
cubicles, Andrew Moseley, the official 
board manager, sits down at his desk. 
He is a black man of average height, 
soft-spoken and serious. He speaks 
slowly, with deliberation. When I ask 
him what the board looks for in a 
successful pardon application, he says 
it varies based on factors like how 
many convictions a person has or 
what type of life they led before their 
arrest.
“Suitability 
trumps 
eligibility 
every time,” he says. “The board likes 
to see people doing community service, 
we look for things like education, 
good references. They also look for 
a person’s sincerity in the application 
process. We look for honestly. We’re 
not interested in people who deny the 
veracity of their conviction because 
we’re not rehashing a case, simply 
going over what has been done since 
then.”

The board also looks at things 
like whether or not applicants have 
kept up with child support payments, 
what their family history is like, and 
if they have a clean motor vehicle 
record. If the board decides not to 
grant a pardon, it might still grant a 
provisional pardon — a certificate ex-
felons can show employers that says 
the state deems them fit to work.

But Moseley acknowledges what 
I’ve often heard Kemp complain 
about: provisional pardons are not 
as effective as they could be because 
the certificate lists all the crimes for 
which a person was convicted. When 
employers see that list, the provisional 
pardon becomes a reason to reject 
an application rather than accept it. 
Moseley said the board is working to 
create a provisional pardon that does 
not list criminal activity, but this may 
not happen for another year or two. 

Moseley sees his office as working 
with the Kemps and Smiths of the 
world rather than against them. He 
speaks with pride about Connecticut’s 
generous 
pardon 
system 
and 
believes strongly that pardons afford 
previously convicted felons a much-
needed chance to reintegrate back into 
society.
“Pardons allow people to get a new 
start, a real new start,” he says. “You’re 
back. Despite the years that have gone 
by, you’re back to never having been 
convicted.”

going back is easier said than 
done. The pardon application 
is fourteen pages long, with three 
additional pages for references. Like 
a college application, it asks for 
personal background information, a 
list of community service activities, 
and a few essays on why you should 
be granted a pardon.

Kemp tells me it took her roughly 
seven months to compile her own 
pardon application, which required 
hunting down old job supervisors 
recommendations, 
getting 
fingerprinted at the police station, 
and tracking down her written arrest 
record. “Putting the pardon package 
together and realizing how much I’d 
accomplished made me extremely 
proud of where I’ve come since the 
incident,” Kemp says.

She even asked her fourteen-year-
old son to write a letter on her behalf 
(“Why should Mommy get a pardon?” 
she remembers asking him), adding 
that she left his letter unedited so that 
his voice “really comes through.” She 
chokes up as she remembers what he 
wrote: “My mother is a very good 
mom... she teaches me the way to 
grow up so my life can be better than 
hers.”

At this point, Kemp pulls out her 
own pardon application to show me. 
It’s a huge packet, probably at least 
thirty pages long. As I read through, I 
am struck by the sincerity one passage 
in particular:
“A pardon will allow me the 
opportunity to live life on a clean 
slate, claim my freedom, and peace 
of mind,” she writes in Section 13: 
Purpose of Application. “My mother 
has been by my side through my 
transformation and I would love to 
show her how I have moved on with 
my life for the good.”

For Kemp, the stakes are high. 
If she loses her job, she might once 
again face hostile employers. When 
she decides it’s time for her family to 
move homes, she will once again have 
to apply for subsidized housing. More 
than these practicalities, a pardon 
would finally divorce her crime from 
her character.
“I made a bad choice and I had to
