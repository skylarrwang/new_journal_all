Spring 2012
Nodelman recalled that this area—
past the parking garage, beyond 
the unfinished highway’s premature 
end—remained an unused no-man’s 
land for decades, wracked by sha chi, 
or negative energy. Now, the area 
between North Frontage and Legion 
Streets is a parking lot that seems to 
stretch from Dwight Street to the 
horizon. I had the sense that the 
massive lot is never completely filled. 
Residents of the former Oak 
Street neighborhood reunited years 
after its dismemberment at Anthony’s 
Oceanview Restaurant on Lighthouse 
Road. City lore considers the area a 
battlefield where a residential culture 
was mowed down by a mayor’s 
unthinking hubris. As Nodelman 
and I stood at the brink of the great 
paved-over expanse, I asked him 
whether the parking lot between 
Dwight and Orchard Streets could use 
a space clearing ceremony. “I would 
say it does,” he said, “but that’s called 
earth clearing, and I don’t do that. I 
have a friend in Seattle who does earth 
clearing, and I usually refer people to 
him. He can do it on-site or remotely.”


I 
knew before he rang my doorbell 
that I was not Nodelman’s ideal 
client. He likes to help people who 
are desperate for his help. “I actually 
appreciate that they’re as open as they 
are,” he said of these clients. “I tell 
people, the more you tell me, the more 
I can help you. If you tell me your 
most innermost desires, then that’s 
what we can work on.” Nodelman 
recently graduated from a program 
in marriage and family therapy at 
Southern Connecticut State University 
and is licensed as a drug and alcohol 
counselor by the state of Connecticut. 
He works as a counselor a few hours 
a week at West Haven and Milford 
Youth and Family Services.	


Unlike some of Nodelman’s 
clients, I dislike talking to strangers 
about my problems. He told me 
not to clean before his visit, but I 
couldn’t resist kicking a heap of dirty 
laundry into my closet. Still, it’s hard 
to get my apartment entirely neat. My 
roommate is similarly cavalier about 
our living space. At the time, she and I 
were flummoxed by our kitchen sink’s 
failure to drain. A mud-colored liquid 
speckled by coffee grounds had welled 
up there for a few days. (Later, I rolled 
up my sleeves and plunged in an arm 
to loose debris from the drain. My 
roommate came home and shrieked 
with joy. “What did you do?” she 
asked.)


I sat Nodelman at my kitchen 
table, so he could not see the liquid in 
the sink. He found my kitchen to have 
good chi, although he recommended 
that I move the toaster next to 
the microwave in order to bundle 
together the Fire energy. Its current 
position next to the fridge created an 
undesirable juxtaposition of Water 
and Fire elements. 


Along with my completed Four 
Pillars chart, Nodelman brought along 
the tools of his trade. He keeps the 
colorful lo pan tucked under his arm, 
in a soft brown leather case. He also 
has a small black box that detects 
electromagnetic fields in volts per 
meter. He uses two metal dowsing 
rods, L-shaped and about a foot long, 
to trace geopathic stress lines. He 
holds them loosely in front of his hips 
and watches them bend apart or inch 
closer together. After he’s finished, 
he tucks the rods into a pouch of 
crushed red velvet. Nodelman said he 
can often intuit the needs of a space 
without any instruments. He was born 
with a cleft palate and retains a cut 
in his mouth that never completely 
healed. He said this slit is sensitive 
to air quality and smoke. “It’s like my 
built-in meter,” he said.


Nodelman can spend three or 
four hours on a consultation. Because 
we were short on time, he focused 
on my bedroom. He checked for 
electromagnetic fields around my 
pillow and recommended that I

unplug a nearby lamp. “You can’t put a 
price on a good night’s sleep,” he said. 
He turned next to my overstuffed 
bookshelves and recommended that 
I thin the books until someone with 
two glasses of water could set them 
down. “This can be a cure for allowing 
new possibilities to come in,” he said. 
“The bookshelves are bowing from 
the weight of the books, so you could 
feel like there’s a lot of weight on 
your shoulders.” Taking in the stacked 
tomes that loomed like thunderclouds 
over my bed, I felt as though I’d 
caught myself complaining about 
a particularly arduous homework 
assignment.


Before he left, Nodelman told 
me that he once consulted a massage 
therapist who couldn’t work because 
her hands were red with eczema. 
He discovered moss growing up an 
exterior wall and recommended she 
power-wash the house. “It cleared 
right up,” he recalled.


Nodelman’s faith in small changes 
was catching. Not long after he visited 
my kitchen, I decided to move the 
toaster next to the microwave. I 
needed to shuffle around a few things, 
squishing the olive oil, vinegar, and 
knives closer together. I wedged in 
the toaster. Its sides were sticky. It 
occurred to me that the sides of 
our toaster—like the strip of floor 
under our couch—are a part of our 
apartment that my roommate and I 
have neither touched nor cleaned in 
the year and a half we’ve lived here. 
I wiped my hands and looked at the 
toaster and the microwave for several 
minutes. The larger, sleeker microwave 
reclined powerfully, leonine in its 
corner. The toaster stared back at me, 
small, white, and spunky. Eventually, 
my roommate came home.
“Do you notice anything different 
about the kitchen?” I asked finally.
“The toaster is in a different 
place,” she said.
“Do you like it?” I asked.
“I like it,” she said.
I asked her if she felt anything 
more.
“I like it a lot,” she said. “Is there 
something else different that I missed? 
It looks very nice. Is there something 
else?”


recently 
returned 
without 
Nodelman to the Air Rights Garage 
and made my way to its roof, nine 
stories up. It was warmer there than 
at street level. I took off my jacket. 
There was nothing between me and 
the sun. 


The rooftop parking lot is 
concrete, and the few pebbles 
lying around are concrete, and a 
pockmarked concrete wall about 
four feet high rims the whole space. 
I stepped over crusty old snow to the 
edge. I looked downtown, over the 
cardboard-colored AT&T building, 
over the Walgreens where once I 
overheard a man say in Spanish 
that he got his black eye in a fight. I 
could read the time on the clock atop 
Harkness Tower, the Gothic icon of 
Yale University, but the tower was 
very far away. My apartment was 
blocked by one of the twin high-
rises on Crown Street. It seemed far 
away, too. Ambulances wailed on their 
way to the nearby hospital. A breeze 
was chasing away the smell of car 
exhaust. Dust-colored birds alighted 
on the perimeter wall, chirping shrilly. 
I looked down on the spot where the 
Oak Street Connector pools into a 
roundabout planted with unflowering 
shrubs. This complicated mess of 
roads is always clogged with traffic. I 
thought some more about a people’s 
continuous efforts to control the 
land I was looking at. I imagined the 
primordial New Haven, a low, silky 
swamp. I wondered whether the city 
was doomed to failure, or whether 
its leaders simply needed to be more 
thoughtful and meticulous in planning 
their space.


Through the tall buildings of the 
Yale School of Medicine, past a few 
smokestacks that billowed chemical 
steam, I could make out a sliver of 
blue. I once asked Nodelman about 
the damage this city incurred by 
cutting itself off from the sea. “Water 
is a really strong life force,” he said. 
“If you cut off the water energy for 
people, it’s going to create a problem 
for them.” I asked him how he would 
fix New Haven. “For something this 
major, you could hang all the mirrors 
and talismans in the world and it 
wouldn’t do a thing,” he said. 


I braced myself against the low 
wall, letting the unfinished cement 
scratch my palms, and looked straight 
down. I knew I wasn’t going to fall, 
but I still felt queasy from the height.
