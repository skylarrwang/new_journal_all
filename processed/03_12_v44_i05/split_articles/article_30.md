A Conversation 
with Sarah 
Stillman
Reading Sarah Stillman’s resume is scary. 
Six years after she graduated from Yale 
with a Marshall Scholarship, as well as 
both Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in 
Anthropology, Stillman has written for 
The Nation, The Washington Post, 
The Atlantic.com, and The New Yorker. 
“The Invisible Army,” which The New 
Yorker published last June, is a finalist for 
a National Magazine Award. She sat down 
with The New Journal to talk about finding 
her journalistic voice.
The New Journal: How was your 
road from Yale to writing for 
magazines like The New Yorker ?
Sarah Stillman: Highly circuitous. 
I went to Oxford, where I realized 
that I could get cheap tickets to go 
travel during breaks. I started flying 
off to places where I wanted to 
pursue stories—Berlin, West Africa, 
Australia. I started doing side stories 
on the Iraq war and other issues that I 
cared about, but I quickly realized that 
super-opinionated punditry wasn’t my 
strong suit. I’m more comfortable 
with in-depth narrative and slow, 
methodical reporting—the sort of 
stuff you don’t have to turn around in 
a day for the blogosphere.


TNJ: What is your philosophy 
when you go out to get a story?
SS: Often, I start by looking for 
socially relevant stories that are at 
the margins of more widely-reported 
events 
or 
phenomena—stories, 
for instance, that emerge from the 
questions that remain unanswered by 
mainstream headlines. Then, I try to 
start scratching beneath the surface 
through reporting, making phone 
calls, showing up in the relevant places. 
I try to be open to the facts on the 
ground and the places they lead me. 
It’s amazing how often my initial, tidy 
idea of a story gets complicated or 
even totally unraveled once I actually 
show up and start poking around. 
Often, I’ll find that something far 
more nuanced and interesting is taking 
place than what I’d imagined. 


TNJ: You uncovered the story of  
an “invisible army” of  foreign 
workers at U.S. army bases, which 
was published in The New Yorker in 
June 2011. How did you know that 
that was the place that you should 
go and the story that you should 
cover?
SS: When I was at Oxford, I was in this 
Indian restaurant and my waiter heard 
my American accent and came to me 
and said, “Oh my gosh, I worked on a 
US military base and I have pictures of 
me and Jessica Simpson.” He busted 
open his phone and had all these 
pictures. He had had a really great 
experience in Iraq. He shared with 
me how many of his friends from his 
hometown also ended up there—but 
he also had colleagues who’d faced 
serious abuses and injuries. When I 
was able to go to Iraq for the first time 
in 2008, that was one of the things on 
my radar — who is this international 
workforce?


As soon as I arrived, I noticed that 
these 
workers 
were 
ubiquitous. 
Everywhere I went, they were cooking 
all of the food, they were cleaning 
the latrines, they were trucking all of 
the goods from here to there. You 
couldn’t be in Iraq and not see them. 
But I noticed that I had read very 
little about where these people come 
from. They were Indians, Bengalis, 
Fijians, and from Sierra Leone. It 
was stunning to me that we had tens 
of thousands of these people, but 
rarely read about the conditions that
