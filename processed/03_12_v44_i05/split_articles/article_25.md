The New Journal
and Allick has a suggestion for a 
better route. “Turn up here, H., onto 
Edgewood.” He swivels backward to 
explain, “I memorized New Haven 
so much that I travel by the light. I 
memorized all of the quickest traffic 
lights. I’m impatient, so I will go the 
easiest route according to which light 
is going to change and which takes the 
longest.”

It’s not long before Allick 
recognizes someone at a home we pass 
and comments to Gallman, “Blizz be 
over here all the time—he always on 
the porch.”

“Well, I think he married one of 
them,” Gallman replies.

“It gotta be Ron G baby mother. 
It gotta be the younger sister.”

“Yeah, it is.”

“Alright—it can’t be the other 
one, because she live on the other side 
of the fence. I used to think ‘Why 
Blizz always on the porch?’ but you 
just confirmed it! He married one of 
them.” 

Allick turns to me in the peanut 
gallery. “There are three sisters we 
know over here, and one of my boys 
married one of them.” 

Back to Gallman: “I didn’t 
know…so he left Tash. Right?”

“Mm-hm.”

W
hen I give Yale tours, I 
explain our own comically 
overprivileged mixed-income housing 
system, the residential colleges, which 
I would argue does create diverse 
friendships. And just as Allick took 
close care to describe the community 
aspect of the Tribe, there is much 
talk on Yale tours about the general 
happiness and lack of competition 
among the student body here. 

Does that generalization describe 
all Yalies, all of the time? Certainly not. 
I don’t think 18 to 22-year-olds would 
really have formative experiences if 
they were happy and comfortable all 
of the time.  The anxiety of navigating 
Yale is hardly comparable to the 
anxieties of living in the old Elm 
Haven, but it is a tangible part of the 
tapestry of life here.

Darrel’s tour certainly paints the 
Tribe in a positive light. But must he 
acknowledge the darker moments 
between community members in 
the Tribe to be telling “the truth” 
about the place? He and I both deal 
in allusions—we will mention those 
moments if asked about them. But 
I see in Allick my own tendency 
to favor qualities I value in my 
community when recruiting new 
members, or explaining ourselves to 
visitors—I think it helps turn those 
values into realities. Allick and I aren’t 
going to bring up competition among 
students or the lure of a career in the 
drug traffic, because we believe in the 
power of narrative to shape a culture. 

T
o hear a different voice from the 
inside of the Dixwell community, 
I walk into Monterey Place on a 
Sunday afternoon during holiday 
season. In the community resource 
center, a white-painted building next 
door to Wexler-Grant School on 
the north end of the development, 
the New Haven Police Department 
has funded a holiday party. Children 
emerge across the empty lawn, trailing 
parents with take-home baggies of 
fried chicken and Cheetos. Inside, two 
women are directing the takedown of 
decorations, which will be bundled in 
a lace tablecloth that tears off a little 
at the corner when you try to tie it. It’s 
kind of stiff and has a couple of hot 
sauce stains. 

“Don’t worry about it, honey—I 
think that may be on its last leg.”

The lady in charge is Barbara 
Whitaker, president of the Residents’ 
Council of Monterey Place. She is “a 
senior citizen and proud of it,” with a 
buoyant Congresswoman hairdo and 
a floor-sweeping peacock wool coat. 
She and fellow event coordinator 
Gloria Gray are gathering up the 
extra food and distributing it to those 
making their way out. “If we leave it in 
the kitchen here, kids will just steal it.” 
Finally, the only things left in the main 
front room are an empty table and a 
Christmas tree blinking a glow across 
the cement floor.

Whitaker has lived here since 
1964, save a five-year period when her 
husband was in the military.  She got a 
degree in social services and has been 
active in community leadership since 
the early eighties. “And she is related 
to everyone in New Haven,” says Gray, 
who at fifty has several grandchildren 
of her own. Whitaker’s job is to 
mediate between the residents of the 
subsidized Monterey Place units, the 
Housing Authority, HUD, and the 
private landlord Beacon Corcoran 
Jennison (BCJ). She can tell you all 
about the negotiations surrounding 
the planning of Monterey Place, when 
“they told us we were gonna have 
chandeliers, and then that went under 
the rug. Oh, and basements, which I 
wish we did have with all these storms 
and stuff.” 

Today Whitaker’s biggest day-
to-day work is navigating the “gray 
area” between the stipultions of the 
different agencies that supervise the 
low-income residents. HUD only 
comes to inspect their homes once 
a year, but BCJ requires four to five 
inspections a year, about which they 
give varying degrees of notice. 

“It’s an aggravation. It got to the 
point where we got two lawyers from 
Legal Aid,” said Whitaker, “because 
the real estate company has some big 
time 
lawyers—money, 
honey—all 
the way in Washington D. C., so we 
got our lawyers to say to them, ‘The 
laws of Connecticut state if it’s not 
an emergency, they have no right to 
come into your home when you are 
not there.’ As a matter of fact, one girl 
moved out because of it. Oh god, what 
was her mother’s name? She comes 
home, and this maintenance guy is 
standing in the middle of her floor. 
And she didn’t call for maintenance!”

“Oh, wow,” murmurs Gray. 

“Oh, it’ll come to me. I think it 
was Renée’s niece—”

“Renée?”

“Renée that passed.”

“Oh, okay. Okay. Shawna.”

“Yeah. It was her house. And 
really it was an invasion of privacy.”

Like Whitaker, Gray has lived 
here since the beginning. She says the 
biggest change in the community since 
it was redone is that people are “more 
to themselves. We have a lot of new 
people here, which is good, but they 
don’t socialize or interact as much.” 

“When we first moved here,” 
Gray continues, “all of the parents 
got together, and we gave them 
respect. Everybody was our mom. 
And you had better give them respect 
because if you did something wrong, 
everybody’s on the phone, and by the 
time you got home, Momma’s in the 
door. Today you don’t have that.”

Whitaker agrees. “At old Elm 
Haven, no matter what all our 
problems were, I’ll tell you point 
blank: we had a unity there. Maybe 
it’s because of the way the homes are 
situated now. It’s supposed to be less 
dense. Today you put up a poster for 
an event, and not that many people 
will come.” 

Gray chimes in: “Used to be with 
events, you would know somebody 
who knows so-and-so, and everyone’s 
asking ‘are you going to the meeting 
tonight?’ Not anymore. Then again, a 
lot of people don’t like the way it is 
here no more.”

“That’s because they have to 
follow rules and regulations, which is a 
good thing,” says Whitaker. They both 
agree the changes in the community 
are good on the whole. But they say 
young people’s involvement in crime 
is rising since its original drop in the 
early 2000s. “Back then, the guys 
who go to the Q House could leave 
at eleven or twelve o’clock and end 
up safe.  My fear now is that another 
neighborhood may come driving 
by and shooting and things of that 
nature.”

“That’s my concern,” says Gray. 
“You can have programs for the 
kids, but these kids are what they 
Monterey Place homes opposite Wexler-Grant School on Foote Street 
frame Yale’s Payne Whitney Gymnasium.
