EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
As I walked through Dwight, a 
largely residential neighborhood west 
of downtown New Haven, I saw trash 
and recycling bins crammed into alleys 
between buildings and, occasionally, 
waiting out at the curb. Pickup for 
most residents was still two days away, 
but many of the bins were already 
brimming. 


The recycling waiting inside 
those bins, or toters, has recently 
become a major focus for the city in 
recent years. In late 2009, the Board 
of Aldermen authorized a new single 
stream recycling policy that the Office 
of Sustainability, partly established 
to create this policy, implemented 
citywide by the end of last year. Single 
stream recycling means that residents 
no longer need to sort their items into 
glass, paper, and plastic. Instead, the 
city’s Department of Public Works 
picks up the mixed recyclables and 
exports them to Willimantic Waste 
in Norwich, Connecticut, where they 
are processed by a machine and their 
remains bundled into large bales to be 
resold. 


The city distributed blue ninety-
six-gallon toters for recyclables and 
brown forty-eight-gallon ones for 
trash to every home in New Haven, 
free of charge. Most of the toters that 
I saw along the streets and alleyways 
of Dwight seemed to have items 
sorted properly -- recyclables in the 
blue and trash in the brown.
Although 
data 
shows 
that 
recycling rates have tripled overall, 
and in every neighborhood, not all 
districts recycle equally. Currently, 
most neighborhoods report rates 
between 21 and 28 percent, and 
there is significant room for growth. 
Areas such as Dwight which haven’t 
consistently recycled in the past 
have shown limited increases since 
the policy has been implemented, 
especially compared to areas like East 
Rock with historically higher recycling 
rates. Despite the city’s efforts, which 
include 
new 
toters, 
educational 
campaigns, 
and 
mobilization 
of 
community 
management 
teams, 
certain neighborhoods still lag behind. 


Why are some residents so 
resistant? It seems that the city could 
hardly make it easier to recycle: its bins 
are bigger, its instructions clearer, and, 
more importantly, the process has been 
drastically simplified. But there’s only 
so much that the city can accomplish 
through policy. An important factor 
seems to be the example of other 
residents; if residents recycle, it’s likely 
their neighbors will too.


To Christine Tang, director of 
New Haven’s Office of Sustainability, 
the increase in recycling rates isn’t 
enough. “Recycling isn’t optional,” 
said Tang. “It’s a state law and it’s 
a requirement in the city of New 
Haven.” Tang said that neighborhoods 
with higher rates of rental occupancy 
and greater population density usually 
have lower recycling rates, though 
she was quick to note that correlation 
does not imply causation. 
Neighborhoods with higher rates 
of turnover also have lower recycling 
rates, said Justin Elicker, Ward 10 
alderman and chair of the City 
Services and Environmental Policy 
committee. Immediately following 
the distribution of new bins, recycling 
rates increased significantly, he said. 
But as educational campaigns were 
completed, the message didn’t get 
out to people who had moved, which 
was a particular problem in the 
neighborhoods with more turnover. 
To meet the city’s ambitious recycling 
goals—30 percent of household waste 
recycled by the end of 2012 and 58 
percent by 2020—all neighborhoods 
need to participate.
Tang 
has 
considered 
implementing certain “enforcement 
mechanisms,” although no decisions 
have been made. Though the Office of 
Sustainability would rather maintain a 
friendly relationship with city residents 
than apply the proverbial big stick in 
dealing with “serial noncompliers,” 
said 
fines, 
though 
unpopular, could be an option.
