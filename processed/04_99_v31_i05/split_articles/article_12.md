A 
.rusud highway overpass blcxlt~ half: the sky to the west 
of Farnam Courts, one of the-iiaily developmena run by 
HANH, the Housing Aumtiq of New Hawn. On 
1-91, it takes merely seconds to speed t;\ the sprawling compfttx below 
on the way north to Hartford or soath to f-9S al\d ~York City. 

Down on the ground, though, the three blocks from one end of 
Farnam to the other seem to go on forever, an iftfinite stretch of brick 
and iron railing. Within the walls, empty plazas of clothesline and 
concrete blanket the project in stillness. From down below, the 
highway and its massive concrete pillars separate the area from the rest 
of New Haven, allowing just one lint of traffic, Grand Avenue, in and 
out. Only Franklin Street veers off Grand into Farnam CourtSÂ· 
running between parking lots and residential buildings to the weeds 
and railroad track at the northern end of the project. At Farnam's 
entrance, on the corner of Franklin and Grand, stand wire fences and 
old jungle gyms pounded into the dirt. Welcome to The Ghetto.
