Amidst Buckley's accolades, however, is 
anÂ· astute assessment of the troubles a series 
such as the Annals of Communjsm inevitably 
must face. The world of Soviet studies has 
traditionally been as bipolar as the Cold War 
world itself, but with a battlefield not nearly 
so tepid. The dipoles are, on the left, the 
revisionists, who see the Soviet Union as a 
noble experiment gone tragically wrong, and 
on the right, the anti-communists for whom 
Soviet oppression was the inevitable outcome 
of any experiment with socialism. The 
historical truth, which presumably lies 
somewhere in the middle, is potentially very 
dangerous to both poles. A series such as the 
Annals, therefore, which proposes to publish 
thousands of previously unavailable Soviet 
documents, is a political powder-keg. As 
Buckley observes: 
The left has never liked the idea of disgorg-
ing all the secrets because it has th.e effect of 
eviscerating any trace of idealism in the 
Soviet experiment, at least in the hands of 
its generals. And the right doesn't like it . 
because the firm hand of authoritarian gov-
ernment beckons to a sociery punch-drunk 
with liberalism and suffering now corrup-
tion, crime, inflation and unemployment. 

Jonathan Brent confirms Buckley's 
assessment, noting that the volumes in the 
series are "frequently controversial and subject 
to partisan attack." 

Until recently, the criticism has come 
more often from the left than from the right. 
This is not surprising given the volumes the 
series has published thus far. The Yale Press 
gave the editorship of Lenin's secret 
correspondences to Harvard historian 
Richard Pipes. Pipes, a former national 
security advisor to President Reagan, portrays 
Lenin as consummately evil. According to the 
book's introduction, Lenin's rightful heirs are 
not merely Stalin and Brezhnev, but Hider 
and Saddam Hussein. This is hardly a 
revisionist stance, and crus volume has been 
duly attacked from the left for making Lenin 
into Lucifer. The Secret World of American 
Communism, a similarly hard-line anti-
communist work, has been criticized even by 
non-revisionist scholars. Reviewing the work 
for The New Republic, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., 
a staunch anti-communist, complains that 
the work comes down too harshly on 
American communists. Once again, it is the 
left that has had occasion to criticize the Annals. 


It comes as a surprise therefore to read 
that "the Soviet studies field has been 
captured by revisionists who dismiss as Cold 
War humbug the notion that the Soviet 
Union was a totalitarian country." Yet this is 
the position of Jacob Heilbrunn, author of an 
October 1998 article in The New Republic. 
The article, entitled "Historical Correctness," 
accuses Jonathan Brent of having "caved" to 
the pressures of revisionist historians. 

Heilbrunn, a Senior Editor at The New 
Republic, ba.seS his claims upon the fact that 
Brent and the Yale Press denied Sdviet scholar . 
Vla~fimir N. Brovkin an editorship after 
solicitin_g a proposal from him. Brovkin 
applied for the editorship of the volumes in 
the series dedicated to the Soviet prison 
system, known as the gulag, a system already 
made inf.unous by the prolific literary works 
of Alexander Solzhenicsyn. Brent approached 
Brovkin in 1997, asking him to submit a 
proposal. Brovkin submitted a seven-page 
prospectus and the proposal was scrutinized 
in the Yale Press's stringent review process. 
The Annals' ~ry 
committee voted nearly 
unanimously against giving the editorship to 
Brovkin, and Brent informed Brovkin in a 
letter this past August that his proposal had 
been denied. 

A committed anti-communist and an 
opponent of revisionist portrayals of the. 
Soviet system, Brovkin was described by 
Heilbrunn as "a brilliant historian." He had 
bee!) suggested to Brent by the venerable 
writer Robert Conquest and by the 
aforementioned Richard Pipes. Brovkin 
worked with Pipes at Harvard, where he 
taught until recendy, when he was denied 
tenu re in what Heilbrunn calls a 
"controversial and dubious decision." Since 
leaving Harvard, Brovkin has been unable to 
find another full-time teaching position; he is 
currently helping to direct a study of Russian 
crime at American University. Prior to his 
stint at Harvard, Brovkin was a member of 
the Government department at Oberlin 
College, where among his proteges was one 
Jacob Heilbrunn. 

After being denied the gulag editorship, 
Brovkin contacted his former student 
Heilbrunn. Brovkin believed (and still insists) 
that he was rejected by Brent because the 
Annals of Communism's board of advisors is 
dominated by revisionist historians who not 
only refuse to publish non-revisionist history 
but also hold a gru"dge against Brovkin for his 
attacks on revisionist historians in the past. 

Through his mouthpiece, Heilbrunn, 
Brovkin claimed that Brent's decision to 
reject him was not based on hls ability as a 
scholar. Rather, say Brovkin and Heilbrunn, 
the rejection was based solely on 
historiographical politics. 

Brovkin and Heilbrunn's accusations are 
unfounded and unsupported, betraying a 
paranoia of a revisionist stranglehold on 
Soviet studies that simply does not exist. As a 
result, Heilbrunn constructs a largely 
spurious account of the events: his building 
blocks are sound-bite quotations, his mortar 
hyperbole. In an article in The Nation 
examining the controversy caused by the 
Heilbrunn article, 
Eric Altermann 
demonstrates that Heilbrunn's argument 
employs willful misreading and deliberate 
deceptiqn. In an attempt to portray the 
reviewers of Brovkin's proposal to the Yale 
Press as apologists for the Soviet regime, 
Heilbrunn cites editorial committee member 
Mark von Hagen, director of Columbia 
University's Harriman Institute for Russian 
and East European Studies. Heilbrunn quotes 
von Hagen as claiming that the gulag 
contained "the kinds of criminals who are 
incarcerated in every viable state." Heilbrunn 
makes von Hagen appear to be a foolish 
Soviet sympathizer who denies the horror of 
the gulag system and its role in Soviet

political oppression. In order to paint chis 
portrait of von Hagen, and by extension the 
YUP editorial committee, Heilbrunn has done 
something ~at would make any sixth-grade 
English teacher cringe: separate a "not only" 
from a "but also." Heilbrunn has 
conveniently sliced off the first part of von 
Hagen's sentence: "the camps held not only 
large numbers of f31sely accused citizens and 
political oppositionists .... " Thus von Hagen's 
comment that the wrongfully imprisoned 
were not the only inmates is spun around by 
Heilbrunn to mean that only criminals were 
imprisoned in the gulag. 

Heilbrunn's selective quotation is not the 
only hole in his careered attack against che 
YUP-ic is merely an indicator of his attack's 
lack of depth. Heilbrunn and Brovkin claim 
chac Brent caved into pressure from an 
editorial board controlled by revisionists. This 
claim is simply noc borne ouc by the facts. 
The Annals of Communism series is 
governed by an editorial advisory committee 
comprised of 17 American and 12 Russian 
scholars and archivists. Before a new project 
can be added, a proposal must be presented 
before the American section of the advisory 
comrnitt~e. If the proposal is approved and a 
manuscript produced, it must still survive the 
rigors of University Press peer review. Often 
the Yale Press solicits as many as three co five 
outside readings before making the decision 
co publish. 

Seven members of the American advisory 
committee responded in writing co Brovkin's 
proposal for che gulag volume. Five of the 
responses were negative. Of che two 
remaining responses, one was a mixed review 
and one a positive assessment. Professional 
standards do not allow the YUP to release the 
names of che scholars who considered 
Brovkin's proposal. Brent, however, has 
written that while two of the five negative 
responses were penned by scholars who could 
be categorized as revisionist, the remaining 
three responses came from scholars with "no 
particular political agenda." It is due to the 
responses of these three scholars, Brent says, 
that he chose not to offer the editorship to 
Brovkin. Brent also points out that the same 
advisory committee that denied Brovkin the 
editorship of the gulag volume rejected a 
revisionist's candidacy for a volume on the 
assassination of Leningrad Party leader Sergei 
Kirov. Brovkin cannot make a case for a 
personal bias either: his last book, Th~
