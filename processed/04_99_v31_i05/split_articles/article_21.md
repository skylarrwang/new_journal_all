EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The Yale series' widely-applauded efforts to 
reveal the truth about Soviet communism 
has inevitably resulted in an objectivdy anti-
Soviet ~rspecrive, and any trace in that 
series of revisionist apologies for the Soviets 
exist only in the imagination of the patho-
logically suspicious. 


There is a difference between opposing 
revisionist history and becoming so obsessed 
with discrediting it that your scholarly work 
becomes no longer scholarly, no longer 
designed 
to 
elucidate 
history. If 
historiography is lowered into mere diatribe 
against other historical viewpoints, history 
becomes a more political tool. Herein lies the 
irony in Brovkin's dispute with the Yale Press. 


One of the most terrifying powers of the 
totalitarian state is the ability to manipulate 
history for political ends. Brovkin accuses the 
Yale Press of trying to shape history by only 
sponsoring revisionist history, but time and 
again Brovkin has used his own historical 
works to attack his enemies in the academy. Is 
there a conspiracy among academics against 
true history as Brovk.in claims, or is he the 
one to be feared? Brovkin allows his view of 
how history should be told to cloud his 
pursuit of the truth-this is why he did not 
receive the editorship of the gulag volume. 


Jacob Heilbrunn, defending his former 
mentor, is guilty of the same error: allowing 
his personal feelings to interfere with his 
professional writing. Heilbrunn's position as a 
former student of Brovkin's should have 
prevented him from writing the piece on 
Brovk.in's dispute with the Yale University 
Press. Another irony comes to mind: the 
opening of the Soviet archive has led Soviet 
studies into a period of revolution not unlike 
the Russian Revolution, with different 
factions fighting for control of a new era. 


Brovkin and Heilbrunn, in their blind effon 
to tell the truth and fight those who differ in 
opinion, are doing their best to impersonate 
Lenin, at least the Lenin described by 
Richard Pipes.
