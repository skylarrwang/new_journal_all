housing, which gives low-income families 
rent vouchers to live in private sector 
housing, is seen as cleaner, quieter, and more 
desirable than public housing projects. This 
building, however, had failed inspection on at 
least four different occasions, and due to the 
landlady's failure to enact the specified 
changes, the Housing Authority had withhdd 
its rent vouchers for nearly a year. With the 
landlady claiming she couldn't make 
improvements without rent money and the 
Section 8 managers claiming they couldn't 
give money unless they saw improvements, 
the situation had led to an eleven-month 
stalemate in which both sides had turned to 
Bland to resolve the issue once and for all. 
When he arrived at the residence, Bland 
headed around back to check out the yard. 
The landlady and her Section 8 manager 
were already on the porch, but Bland waved; 
he would be right back. He only needed one 
glance to make his assessment. 
"Mmm-hmin, that's going to need to be 
cleaned up," he mumbled to himself. Pieces 
of paper and decaying candy wrappers lined 
the inside of the chain-link fence surrounding 
the yard . 
The tails of Bland's long, brown trench 
coat whipped above the ground, flapping in 
·the wind. But Bland seemed oblivious to the 
cold. He called over the landlady and Monica 
Blazic, head of Section 8 in New Haven, and 
they moved on to the basement. 
"See that?" Bland pointed through the 
basement window to a storage pile. ·~ that 
junk will have to go. Someone could drop a 
cigarette down there and the whole place 
could go up." 
Blazic mentioned that the missing 
basement window also posed a security risk. 
The landlady looked disturbed. In the five 
minutes she'd been waiting to discuss the rent 
situation, she'd gotten three violations, and 
the HANH people hadn't even gone inside to 
check out the heating problem, which was 
the reason she thought they had come down 
in the first place. Bland kept going . 
"When was the last time you had this 
place painted? You've got some peeling paint 
over there, you know." He pointed to the 
door. "If I go in there and there's no heat, 
there won't be anything to discuss." 
As it turned out, there was heat inside the 
apartment, but the discussion took place only 
between the landlady and the resident, 
Alveria Sanchez. They argued about storage 
space and the neighbors while Bland carried a 
chair around the apartment and checked all 
the smoke detectors. He found one non-
functional smoke detector and waited 
patiently for the arguing to stop. 
"This is how we're going to resolve it," 
Bland began. He turned to the landlady. ''I'm 
not going to pay you until I'm assured that 
the smoke detector is .fixed, the window is 
fixed and the basement's cleaned out. We'll be 
back on Monday." To the resident: "[Within 
weeks] you'll have a new apartment." 
With that Bland took his leave. He had 
four other places to go. 
I watched Bland for the rest of the day, 
hopping from site to site, troubleshooting as 
he went. By the next Monday, the apartment 
on Blatchley Street had passed inspection and 
recently the landlady received her final rent 
payment. Sanchez has since moved out, 
although she has not finalized plans for a 
permanent residence. 


Bland's Housi'ng Authority is more 
efficient than ever, but as it works to please 
officials in Cleveland who in turn work to 
please officials in Washington, it often misses 
the reality of what residents need in New 
Haven, like trash cans and police officers on 
the corner. The ultimate goal remains 
increasing scores on HUD inspections; and at 
that Bland is a great success. If HUD says all 
the toilets in a certain unit must be fixed, 
Bland can do it. If HUD says all the 
apartments in a cenain unit must be sprayed 
for roaches, Bland can do it. If HUD says cut 
back on security and outdoor cleaning in all 
your units (HUD inspections do not grade for 
having guards or cleaning up lawns), he can 
do that, too. Bland confidently states that 
passing HUD inspection by September 1999 is 
not just a goal, it's a given. But passing 
inspection and creating livable housing 
projects ~ay not be the same thing, a 
problem that Bland and HUD seem slow to 
understand. "Things are going to be coming 
down around here. I want to see elbows and 
heels. In 10 years," he continues, "we'll be the 
best housing authority in the state, in the 
country. That's my vision. That's the goal 
we're shooting for."
