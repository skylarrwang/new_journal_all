T he back of 
Soviet Communism 
had not been broken 
for long before the 
spines of Th( Last 
Diary 
of 
Tsarina 
Akxandra were released 
by the Yale University Press 
(YUP) in 1992. The book was the 
first in the YUP's Annals of 
Communism serie.s, a large-scale 
project dedicated to publishing 
scholarly work using the archives of the 
former Soviet Union. According to series 
editor Jonathan Brent, the purpose of the series "is 
. 
to produce a documentary history of Soviet comm~sm , 
from the 1917 revolution to the demise of the system m 1991. Such . 
a window on the Soviet system was not possible before the draWIDg 
back of the Iron Curtain; the archives scrutinized by the Annals of 
Communism only became available to scholars after the 1991 collapse. 
The archives include documents that run the gamut from red tape to 
red bait. Since the release of Th( lAst Diary, five other volumes have 
been published in the series: Th( Fali of th( Romanovs, Th( UnJrm:wn 
Lmin, Stalin's L(tUrs to Molotov, Tht Surtt World of Ama~can 
Communism, and, most recently, Th( Sovitt World of Amazcan 
Communism. Each volume is 
edited by an American scholar 
and a Russian scholar working in 
collaboration. 


Critics of all political stripes have 
praised the Annals of Communism 
series, acknowledging both the vision 
of Brent and the individual work of the 
authors. Senator Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan (o-NY) writes: 


All of us who care ro ensure thal dlis genera-
cion and furure ones possess an adequale under-
slanding of whal rran.spired .~ 
1917 a.J?d 
1991. .. are in lhe dcbl of Yale Uruverslly Press for llS 
effom and contriburions. 


William F. Buckley, wrote an entire syndicated column 
on the series, calling it "a huge contribution to an understanding 
of the mOst important political phenomenon of the century, the rise 
and f.ill of the communist international movement." (So taken with 
the importance of the series is Buckley that he dosed his article with an 
appeal to his readers for finmcial support of the project: "If.you ~ve 
influence, use it to raise money for the Annals of Commurusm senes 
of the Yale Universtiy Press, Jonathan Brent, Executive Editor, 302 
Temple St., New Haven, Conn. o6520. ")
