Peering over the top of her New York Times, 
my mother barked, "Did you catch anything 
yet?" My father pretended not co hear. 

I smiled at him apologetically. Watching 
him cast was like watching golf on television: 
it quickly moved from uninteresting co 
excruciating. All the fly-fishing gadgets in the 
world couldn't make the trout bite. I couldn't 
help but snicker at the fucility of the venture. 

An underground world of fly-fishing 
thrives at Yale, thanks in large part to the 
Migdalski family. Ed Migdalski, a former 
ichthyologist at the Peabody Museum, served 
as the director of Yale's Outdoor 
Education and Club Sport 
programs and as the Fishing Club's 
advisor. An accomplished fisherman, 
Migdalski has traveled the world, 
breaking fishing records and 
collecting samples for the museum. 

Migdalski has since retired-he rurned 81 
this year-but his son, Tom, is also an 
accomplished angler. As a toddler, Tom began 
fishing in the family's duck pond, which the 
elder Migdalski would stock each spring. Now 
Tom occupies the post his father held, 
ensuring that the sport-or as the most 
dedicated argue, the art-of fly-fishing 
continues co flourishes at Yale. He runs the 
Fly-Fishing Club and, with Ken MacKenzie, 
teaches a coUISe in the painstaking art of fly-
tying at Payne Whitney Gymnasium. 

Each year, Yale stocks its own trout pond 
in East Lyme, Connecticut. The students, 
faculty, staff and alumni who make the one-
hour trip co the pond may be expert 
fishermen and fly-tiers or novices who have 
never wetted a line. Although the number of 
fly-fishermen at Yale is small, the camaraderie 
is great. "I've never met a fly-fisher I didn't 
like," said John Gould (BK '99). Relationships 
are forged and nourished around fly-fishing. 

Remember the tear-jerking scenes of familial 
love between Brad Pitt and his brother and 
father in A River Runs Through It? 

There is a mysticism co the sport. 
Something about it compels everyone from 
the novice to the experienced angler to put 
pen to paper. From tales of father-son jaunts 
to the drama of "the one that got away," fly-
fishing inspires literature. According to Joe 
Furia (Pc 'oo), Isaac Walton's book The 
Compleat Angler has been reprinted more than 
any other book except the Bible. 

With chis notion in mind, James Prosek 
(BR '97) and Furia first started the Yale Anglers' 
journal. Furia came to Yale as a pre-frosh 
during Bulldog Days. He brought his rod 
with him because "you never know when 
you're going co pass by a stream," and ended 
up casting on the lawn with then-
undergraduate Prosek, who has since authored 
numerous books on the subject. His first, 
Trout: An Illustrated History, was published 
while he was still an undergraduate. 

Poems, essays and stories by everyone 
from William F. Buckley to Elizabeth Bishop, 
Ed Migdalski and Vmcent Giroud, a curator 
at the Beinecke Library-which houses one of 
the 
biggest 
collections of 
fishing 
literature in 
the United States-have graced the pages of 
the journal. That said, some speak of the spon 
with slighdy alarming devotion. Is fly-fishing 
really a lens through which to view life, or the 
embodiment of the epic struggle between 
man and fish on that boundless sea? 

Still, you can't help but appreciate the 
Zen-like quality of the sport. In the editor's 
note to the ina\lgural edition of the Yale 
Anglers' journal, Furia urges the reader, "Read 
on, pen your passions, and always hope for a 
bigger fish, a better hatch, or a smoother 
case."
