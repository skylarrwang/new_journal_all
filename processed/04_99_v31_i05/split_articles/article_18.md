celebrate. Or I'd have a Monday off and I'd 
have to celebrate," Elliott tells me. "Then I'd 
go to court, my urine comes back dirty, the 
judge puts me in jail for one night, two 
nightS. I miS! court one time because I'm on 
the run, trying to get $10 for a bag. The judge 
says, 'Next time, you're getting your full 
sentence.' 


"Next time comes around, and I'm dirty. 
And I think, well, they've got me, might as 
well get as high as you can, for as long as you 
can, until they catch you. I told my six-year-
old son that I was going away for a while, and 
I told him to be good, and he said, 'No, you 
be good.' 


"I get to court. I was late, I was high. I 
thought the sheriff would shackle me right 
there. W hen I walked in, the j udge 
interrupted whoever was up there, and said, 
'Good afternoon, Mr. Elliott. Thank you for 
coming to court. Would you please remove 
your hat?' 


"He thanked me," Elliott says, shaking 
his head. "I couldn't believe it. He wasn't 
going to just lock me up and throw away the 
key." Elliott spent two weeks in jail and 45 
days in the Stonington Institute, an inpatient 
detox center, and hasn't used crack since. Last 
month, when Elliott graduated from Drug 
Session, Simon interrupted courtroom 
proceedings for him again. The judge came 
down from the bench and embraced him. 


'I'm like the dad, but only to a certain 
point," explains Simon, who grew up 
in Bridgeport, the son of a Puerto 
Rican mother and a Cuban father, both 
immigrantS. "In some drug courtS, you'll see 
there's no space at all between the judge and 
the client, or there might be just a desk But I 
think a certain amount of formality is fine. 
The client has to realize that he's still in a 
courtroom, you know, that this is a judicial 
relationship. I don't want him thinking. 'Hey, 
it's Tuesday, I'm going to see my buddy 
now."' 


Jim C hase adds, "T he judge is like the 
father, and I'm like the big brother." Chase is 
a recovering alcoholic, a status that has 
granted him the influence of experience upon 
his clientS. "If I'm telling somebody that they 
have to give up their addiction, they have to 
put their toys away, they might say, 'Well, 
what the heck do you know about it?' And I 
can say, 'Well, quite a bit, actually.'" 


A certain organic connection to the 
experiences of drug court clients is a state of 
mind that Chase has access to and Sim6n, it 
seems, does not. Chase, a portly gentleman 
with a greying beard and a predilection for 
colorful suspenders and paisley ties, provides 
a rumpled counterpoint to the tall, athletic 
Simon's sleek professionalism. Simon plays 
well the part of the strict, loving father, but 
he does make curious stumbles here and 
there. He forgetS the name of a not-very-new 
client, and one Tuesday tells three male 
defendantS in a row, "You look good, you've 
put on some weight." The third in this line, a 
large fellow with an impressive beer gut, 
reddens slightly and replies, "Yes, sir, I've got 
to work on that. One thing at a time." Bail 
commissioner Ronje Davis rolls her eyes and 
tells Simon, "You've gotta find something else 
to compliment the man on." 


Sim6n moves right past the gaffe to Cara, 
who is feeling prone to a relapse. "How are 
you doing. Cara?" 


''I'm fine if I stay away from my parentS' 
house. Ifl go there then bad things happen." 


"T hen stay away from your parents' 
house!" 


"My kids are there." 


Simon tells Cara to talk to her social 
worker. Cara seems strongly inclined to son 
out her current dilemma with the judge, but 
Simon repeats that she should talk to her 
social worker. It's another mantra, like 
"You've put on some weight," useful in most 
cases but not invariably so. 


"Other than that, though, things are 
going pretty good?" Sim6n asks, with that 
soft smile. 


Cara hesitates. "Yes, sir," she replies, and 
takes her seat again, her audience with the 
judge having arrived at itS swift conclusion. 


A
lthough the New Haven Drug 
Session sees drug offenses as a health 
problem rather than a criminal 
matter per se, this view is strictly 
circumscribed. The program bars the door to 
dealers, however low-level. The drug court 
also does not allow for reductions in length or 
intensity of treatment for users of marijuana 
or marijuana's popular upstart cousin, "illy," 
pot soaked in formaldehyde. Ask Judge 
Simon what differences come into play in 
treating users of marijuana as opposed to 
physically addictive and crippling drugs like 
heroin, and he !lady replies, "None. There's 
not much difference in the need for some 
structure and support in the lives of people 
who use marijuana as there is with any other 
controlled substance." Chaco agrees, citing 
the familiar maxim about pot being a 
gateway drug. 


This a-drug-is-a-drug stance creates 
strange juxtapositions in the courtroom. 
Devon, the college athlete caught for 
marijuana, has his turn with the judge just 
before Alyssa. Alyssa's urinalysis test came 
back clean; her unsteady gait and slightly 
garbled speech can be attributed to 
withdrawal and methadone maintenance. 
T he judge calls her "sweetie" and tells her she 
looks wonderful. Alyssa smiles coquettishly 
and fiddles with her blouse. When she stands 
up, one observes that her skin is slit up the 
back, perilously high. 


"The most obvious difference between 
different drugs is the physical effectS," Sim6n 
says. "This is especially the case with heroin 
and women. It just devastates them 
physically. A lot of them are prostitutes, 
turning tricks to get enough money for the 
next fix." H e pushes some photographs across 
the table to me; they're mugshots of Sandra, 
who was arrested for solicitation a year ago 
and now has just a few weeks before she 
graduates from d rug session. In the 
photographs sh.,e looks wan, haggard, 
emaciated; her mouth is twisted and angry, 
her eyes dead. In the courtroom one sees a 
different person, a mild-looking woman with 
thick brown hair and a sweet smile. 


Sim6n points at Chase, who is passing 
through the judge's office at the end of 
another long day. "He cries every time he sees 
her," the judge says. "I do, I do," Chase says, 
looking at the photos. Sure enough, tears well 
up in his eyes and he takes off his glasses. 


"See? See?" Sim6n exclaims, touched and 
amused. "These women who earn their living 
the way they do, they feel so badly about 
themselves," Chase explains. "With the drug 
court, you can see the complete 
transformation of another human being. It's 
akin to a born-again experience, a radical 
spiritual change." He takes another look at 
Sandra's mug shots. "It's like seeing your own 
daughter being saved."
