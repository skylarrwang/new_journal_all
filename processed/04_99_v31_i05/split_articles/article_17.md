A
s usual, session's starting late, and the people assembled in 
Courtroom C of the city courthouse at 121 Elm Street are 
. 
getting chatty, fidgety, restless. Sheepish-looking teenagers, 
umforml,y tall, black, and hunched beneath their puffy Tommy 
Hilfiger jackets, talk with sheepish-looking lawyers, uniformly white 
and male, their chests puffed out under their double-breasted navy-
blue suits. A young woman in a red sweatshirt, her hair in cornrows, 
sits in the front row of spectator seats, pushing a stroller methodically 
back and forth, staring into space. Another woman-whose Mae West 
strut into the courtoom occasioned one courtgoer to excitedly whisper, 
"Hey, Alyssa's here!" -struts back out again. Alyssa is white, late-
thirtyish, sporting teased bleached-blond hair and a tiny denim skirt 
that she keeps tugging at. She has a nervous habit of shifting her 
weight from one skinny leg to the other, back and forth, teetering on 
her spiked heels; she lasted about three minutes in the courtroom 
before leaving for the bathroom, slurring over her shoulder, "Could 
somebody watch my pocketbook? Don't take the drugs that are in 
there." Her seatmates giggled, and Alyssa laughed too, a high-pitched, 
rattling noise. 

Alyssa's joke catered to her audience: most of the people in the 
spectator seats of Courtroom C are defendants in the Drug Session of 
the New Haven Superior Court. Charged with non-violent, narcotics-
related crimes, clients complete court-ordered drug treatment in lieu of 
prison sentences. After Judge Jorge Sim6n finally takes the bench a 
half-hour past the hearing's 2 PM scheduled starting time, the 
defendants will take turns rising for a brief consultation with the judge. 
Most of these chats with Sim6n amount to genial formalities, as 
friendly and banal as small talk. John, a compact, weatherbeaten man 
in a flatinel shirt and jeans, is called; his turn with the judge is typical. 
"Good afternoon, John. How ya doin'?" 
"Good, sir." 
"Good. You had a negative urine today, good job." 
"Yes, sir." 
"You've put on some weight, you've got some color in your cheeks. 
I'm real proud of you." 
"I'm real proud of mysel£" 

The exchange between judge and defendant would seem 
surprisingly intimate, except for the thirty other defendants watching 
from behind John, a cluster of drug counselors and social workers to 
John's right, and most awkwardly, a ten-foot-long table situated 
between John and the judge's bench. At the table are prosecutors, 
public defenders, court liaisons, bail commissioners and more social 
workers, all listening attentively to the conversation. 

"I want a sense of empathy in the courtrOOm, a sense that everyone 
is working closely together," Judge Sim6n says later, in his chambers. 
He is the sole judge presiding over the New Haven Drug Session; each 
client sees him every other week during the arduous year-long 
treatment program. "I try to foster camaraderie. I make everyone stay 
to listen to all the clients' progress." Perhaps this is why Sim6n is 
chronically late to court: the defendants have a chance to mill around a 
bit, get to know each other outside their required Narcotics 
Anonymous (N.A.) meetings and group therapy sessions. 

Sirn6n is saddled with a difficult task: to play the tough-love father 
to dozens of different people in five-minute increments every two 
weeks. The soft, indulgent smile Sim6n wears while talking to a baby-
faced college freshman ("Basketball season's all done now, right? So you 
can spend some time studying?") is replaced with a mask of suppressed 
ang~r fo;, his next visitor, Manuel, who hobbles to his mark wearing leg 
chams. Manuel had a real unfortunate accident where some bleach 
splashed into his urine sample; we're not sure how," Sim6n tells the 
courtroom, his voice steeped in sarcasm. "So I locked him up." 

Manuel will spend a few weeks in jail for this relapse, and Sim6n has 
also extended the duration of Manuel's treatment by a few months. 
As Sim6n quickly proceeds through these points with Manuel's 
private attorney, the hostility in his voice eases. "So we're going to win 
this thing together, right?" Sim6n asks Manuel, switching to Spanish, 
the offender's first language and his own. "Yes, of course. You have to 
win, because it's your life." Sim6n offers him a big smile; Manuel 
stands silent, nodding. As Manuel and his attorney take their seats, the 
young lawyer huddles down, rubbing his hands together nervously, as 
if implicated in his diem's tra..-1sgression. 

T
he concept of drug courts was the brainchild of Attorney 
General Janet Reno. In cities like New Haven where drug court 
programs have been adopted, defendants can apply to have 
their cases transferred to a single docket dealing exclusively with 
narcotics cases. Under this alternative paradigm of law enforcement, 
rehabilitation is privileged over punishment and viewed as a 
collaborative, even familial effort between judge, prosecutor, defender, 
a battery of social workers and drug counselors, and the defendant. 
Modeled on the pilot drug court program started by Judge Stanley 
Goldstein in Miami, New Haven's court opened in June 1996, the first 
of its kind in Connecticut. It responded to a growing concern that, as a 
means of responding to the state's drug problem, heavy reliance upon 
the criminal justice system was miscalculated. Public defender Jim 
Chase, who represents the majority of drug court defendants, says, "If 
it weren't for this drug court, all of my clients would be going to 
prison. Drugs are the reason why people commit crimes, and nobody 
gets off drugs in jail. With the drug courts, recidivism drops to single 
digits." Of the 65 graduates of the New Haven Drug Session, only five 
have been arrested since on any other charge. 

Without any prompting, Chase will tell you that Goldstein and 
other proponents of alternative sentencing measures for drug crimes 
"aren't knee-jerk liberals." Pat Chaco of Project MORE, the "alternative 
incarceration center" of the New Haven Drug Session and the focal 
point of rehabilitation for drug court clients, also stresses that "the 
drug court program is not easy. It's not soft on crime." 

Chaco, director of substance abuse ueatment at Project MORE, 
continues, "It's very difficult for a client to follow through for one full 
year with treatment. If they apply to drug court just to get out of jail, 
they're not going to make it." Prospective clients are first referred to 
Project MORE by social workers in the p.ublic defender's office. Violent 
Judge jorge Simon dishes out justice, family-style.
