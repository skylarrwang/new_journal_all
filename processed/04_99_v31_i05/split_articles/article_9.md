faster than expected, he entered the restaurant 
business. In 1971, he opened the first 
Mamoun's Restaurant in Greenwich Village, 
New York City. Gradually, he was able to 
bring his immediate family-three elder 
brothers and two younger sisters-to the U.S. 
Together, they expanded the, business, 
founding Mamoun's in New Haven and 
inviting more members of the family to join 
them. 

Suleiman and Belial, Mamoun's nephews, 
are two of the many relatives working in the 
New Haven restaurant. I spent a recent 
evening there during Belial's shift. He 
had little time to talk; the 
restaurant was filled with a 
constant stream of customers. 

Even as he paused to answer 
my questions, his eyes moved 
around the room, alert to every 
detail, every customer's need. 
Then, at r20 AM, when the place 
finally emptied, he had the 
chance co talk as he swept 
the floor and mopped it 
clean with ammonia: "My father told me 
cleanliness is the most important thing." 

Bella! maintained his characteristic focus as he 
worked, only speaking to answer direct 
questions. "A family-run business takes care in 
a special way," he said. "My father says that 
you should think of everything you do as if it 
is for yourself. If you don't eat· the 
food,don'tserveit." 

I asked Belial to 
put on the music 
most often played at 
Mamoun's. Soon a passionate, 
deep, female voice was singing from the 
dining room speakers. This is the voice of 
Oum Koulsoum, he told me, the most 
famous Arab singer of the century. Born in 
Egypt, she was loved throughout the Middle 
East. When she died 30 years ago, 250,000 
people attended her funeral. "What does she 
sing about?" I asked. "Love songs," Belial 
replied. "Love songs full of hurt." 

As I listened, I looked around the room 
more closely. O n the walls around the 
counter, there are large color photographs of 
the Kaaba at Mecca-the holiest place in the 
world for Muslims-surrounded by millions 
of pilgrims dressed in white. When I asked 
Belial about these, he told me that Mamoun 
himself had just returned to the U.S. after 
going on the hajj-a holy pilgrimage to 
Mecca that every Muslim hopes to perform 
once in his lifetime. He had gone with his 
brothers. 

I turned to the Qu'ranic inscriptions hung 
around the room, and asked Bella! if he could 
tell me what they said. He hesitated. 
According co traditional Islamic belief, the 
Qu'ran is the word of God and no translation 
of its Arabic verses can do justice to the 
original meaning. Still, he cautiously provided 
an interpretation pf one: "God bless this 
place." 

It's a popular spot, Mamoun's of New Haven. 
You probably know the place well-the dim 
lantern-cast light, plant-screened windows 
and muted browns. Step over the threshold, 
and it looks like you're a world away from 
New Haven's Howe Street. Elements of the 
Middle East cover the space: ornate Persian-
style rugs, calligraphic inscriptions from the 
Qu'ran, Arab vocal music playing in the 
background. Is the atmosphere authentic, or is 
it only part of a decor contrived to make us 
think we're eating authentic falafel? 
"Seems authentic," more than one 
student said of the food. "It's ;t 
comfortable place," a place to 
relax, eat, chat and smoke. The 
room itself is definitely part of 
the experience, and it's hard not 
to notice the objects in it. But rather 
than propelling most customers into 
probing questions, they serve as a 
backdrop. "I was after a timeless 
look," says Jim Gordeuk, the 
restaurant's business manager since 
its establishment in 1977. "Not too weird, or 
too modern, but comfortable." Obviously his 
plan worked. But although Jim might have 
put them up to create a "look," some of the 
decorations hanging in this room hold more 
meaning.

Mamoun Chater was born in Damascus, 
Syria, the oldest continually inhabited city in 
the world. He grew up in the neighborhood 
of Bab Salaam ("Door of Peace"), one of the 
seven gates of the capital, and came co 
America as a student in 1970. His plan was co 
continue his studies and become a 
pharmacist, but when his money ran out
