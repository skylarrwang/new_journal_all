EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
A congregation of Korean immigrants transforms its children into Korean-Americans 
Koreans are the fastest-growing ethnic group in America. After the 
Immigration Ace of 1965, the number of Korean immigrants ballooned 
a hundred-fold in only a decade, from 200 co 20,000 annually. While 
nearly three-quarters of this co~unicy is affiliated with a Protestant 
church, embracing Western Â· religion hasn't meant assimilation: 
predominantly Korean congregations, like che United Methodist 
Church of New Haven, are prospering. 

At 2 PM every Sunday, Korean-American college students stream 
out of the building as parents ascend the brick steps with young 
children. They have come to chis church from all over Connecticut-
research scientists, post-doctorates, physicians, guest lecturers, 
computer scientists, engineers and housewives. 

United Methodist hosts a temporary community based on a shared 
heritage. Congregants form an insular social network that extends 
outside the church. According to Pastor Soon Kook Ahn, about one-
third lives on the same street in Hamden, and many ochers live in the 
same apartment complexes: Ivy Manor, Avalon and Hamden Hill. The 
families mingle at parties and the adults gather for Bible readings. 
Their children often see each other at school, sit in 
the same English as a Second Language (ESL) 
classes and play with each ocher. 

As important as preserving their Korean 
identity is to the adults, it's equally 
important to them that their 
children 
prepare for 
America. But how can so insular a community prepare its children for 
life outside the church? 

The answer is language. Learning English means power, academic 
achievement and high-paying jobs. Pastor Ahn conducts services in 
Korean, but when he questions the restive Sunday school class on 
religion, he speaks English. After Sunday school, many of the children 
study English composition and grammar, forgoing classes in Korean 
In fact, the children devote themselves so wholeheartedly to 
learning English that many forget Korean. One Korean-American, 
Mark, spoke only Korean when he moved from Texas to New Haven 
at the age of five. After three years of ESL at Worthington Hooker 
Elementary School, Mark speaks English fl.uently-:-but comprehends 
little Korean. Many of the young children~ about to enter school 
understand only simple Korean directions. On one Sunday afternoon I 
observed Hedy, a Sunday School teacher, asking a young boy to repeat 
after her in Korean, "Do you know what day it is?" Befuddled, the boy 
could not answer. She turned co another Korean boy and repeated the 
question. He, coo, remained silent. Finally when a little boy repeated 
the line fluently the entire class cheered. 

Why the celebration? Although their parents recognize English as 
an important tool, many bi-cultural children associate Korean with 
maternal warmth, paternal authority, gossip and the church. The 
ability to speak Korean is a gift: it means not only understanding 
parents' private conversations, but also communicating with 
grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins. 

For children, the choice between Korean and English is not always 
clear. In one Sunday school class, four boys and one girl sac at a small, 
rectangular cable. Unversed in the Bible and Korean, I was nervously 
substituting for their bilingual teacher. Three of the boys had 
arrived from Korea within the past year, while the other boy, 
Mark, sac quietly in the back. The lone girl, Elena, urged 
me to speak only "American" in the classroom. By 
the end of the 4o-minute class, two factions had 
formed, each asserting its respective language. 
I had. instructed the third-grade children to 
follow the 4th Commandment, "Honor thy 
father and thy mother," by drawing cards of 
appreciation on construction paper. Most of 
them drew stick-figure portraits of their 
parents. "I'm drawing Mr. Potato Head!" 
Chung-Bae, a Korean boy shouted. 
Elena ~ked up. "I'm going to call you 
'pig' then." 
Moment of silence &om the other side. 
''I'mpif." 
"Yes! If you call me that." Gulp of air. "If 
you call me something, I call you 
something." 
"I-you are the most," Chung-Bae lifted 
himself &om his seat and swelled his lungs 
with air, "em-bar-rasses!" Another heave of 
breath, "em-bar-rasses!" he shouted, mocking 
her for using English, with its accented 
syllables-which are absent from Korean. 
"Embarrasses is not a word," Elena 
retorted. 

Chung-Bae , 
noticeably 
calmer, 
replied slowly, "So you 
could get state-of-the-
art surgery unavailable 
in her home country. 
n important tool.vnany bi- She can hear well now, 
are a stupid pig."

Translated &om one 
language to the other, with 
these 
seemingly 
incoherent torments 
made perfect sense to 
the 
children. 
Chtmpi, 
or 
"How 
embarrasSing!" carries the connotations of 
babies peeing and parents' scolding. Similarly, 
pig, or t.kji, is common playground parlance 
in Korea, as are the insults wan t.kji and suptr 
wan t.kji, or "king pig" and "super king pig." 

Although acceptance of English isn't 
unanimous, the children have absorbed 
American usage through the popular media. 
Suk-Jae, convinced that the President would 
eventually listen to my tape recording of the 
class, shouted the name of another student's 
love interest, which sounded like "Monica." 
He then read his story in a Korean accent: 
Once there was a snake (I'm going to make 
this ape hear this) named Mark (he's right 
here beside me). He is a harmless grass snake 
and is a goof just like Barney the Dinosaur. 
If you don't know Barney the Dinosaur, 
w.uch Barney, watch Barney the Dinosaur 
and sec how babyish at crv at 5 o'dock. .. 
After splitting the snake in two, Suk-Jae 
announced, "Surgeon General's Warning: this 
document is highly violent and is PG-8. Or 
else it is hazardous to your health." Although 
he used the chtmpi strategy ("see how 
babyish") that Chung-Bae had tried ("em-
bm-.rasses!"), he said it like an American TV 
announcer. 
Suk-Jae's insistence that Bill Clinton 
would overhear the tapes resounds with the 
political embarrassment he hopes to exact on 
his classmate. Despite an imperfect 
pronunc1auon, 
Suk-Jae 
established 
dominance in the classroom over his more 
Buent friend. He had absorbed material &om 
his main channel to the external world, 
television, and incorporated the tropes for his 
schoolwork. 

Eu-Jong, a winsome four-year-old, is 
already taking advantage of American 
opportunities. She was born in Korea, deaf in 
one ear. Until recently, Eu-Jong's disability 
had prevented her &om learning to talk at all. 
Her family moved to the United States so she 
Korean but has some catching 
up to do. She speaks no 
aternal Korean, and babbles in 
her 
own 
incomprehensible 
English. 

Eu-Jong's mother, for her part, speaks 
only halting English. She realizes, though, 
that her daughter's only shot at success 
depends on learning the language, and refuses 
to talk to her in Korean lest she cause 
confusion. She's taking English classes, but it's 
been an uphill struggle. She worries about 
when to pronounce the plural "s" as "z~ how 
to teach her children to ask for more milk 
and how to ask her fifth-grade daughter, 
"What did you do at school today?" 

With so strong a support network, many 
like Eu-Jong and her peers will live out their 
parents' dreams for them. But those dreams 
will undoubtedly take them away from 
United Methodist and old-world traditions. 
Suk-Jae plans to artend Yale, Chung-Bae 
wants to be an architect, Mark aspires to be 
an engineer and Yung-Min, a shy girl who 
speaks little English, hopes to be a lawyer. In 
the shelter of a close Korean community, 
they're learning to speak American.
