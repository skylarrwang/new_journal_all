The United Stakes of America 
Two Yale Profs want to give you $80,000,

ove over, Germany. Move over, 
Japan. It's America's turn to kick 
ass. The Dow Jones just hit 10,000. 
We're breaking records by the hour. The 
NASDAQ is up nearly 20 percent this year. We 
have politicians brave enough to stake their 
careers on those numbers-politicians brave 
enough to throw our Social Security into the 
mix, to make sure America claws its way up 
to 11,000, and then who knows how high? 

A few things have been bothering me, 
though. We keep scoring all these points on 
the Dow. But who are we scoring them 
against? And when do we get to win? 

Let's be serious. Not counting Russia, 
America's wealth is distributed more unevenly 
than any other industrialized country. From 
1973 to 1997, real household income rose 1.6 
percent among the poorest fifth of Americans 
and p percent among the middle fifth. Over 
the same period, reaJ income among the 
richest twentieth rose 56.8 percent. And 
things are getting worse. From 1989 to 1997, 
as the Dow ballooned, real income actually 
dropped 2.4 percent among the poorest and 
0.7 percent for the middle class. The richest 
saw their wealth increase by 20.4 percent. 

Is this the end of American equal 
opportunity? In their new book, Tht 
Staluholdtr Socitty, YaJe professors Bruce 
Ackerman (LAw '67) and Anne Alston (LAW 
'87) hatch a plot to keep the Founders' 
promise of the right to pursue happiness. 
Every citizen, they say, is entitled to an 
s8o,ooo stake in America on his 21st birthday. 
He can spend it however he likes. He can 
snort it in cocaine in a Manhattan high-rise. 
She can blow it on roulette in Vegas. He can 
start a small business. She can pay for college, 
in which case she could claim her stake upon 
matriculation. The government has no say. 
No indentured servitude. No guidelines. 
"Stakes are a marter of right, nor a handout." 
It's time to build the late-capitalist wdfare 
state, Ackerman and Alston write: 

We are rrying to break the hold of the famil-
iar vision of the welfare state in America. In 
this view, modern government has succeed-
ed to the traditional tasks of the church-
tending to the old, the sick, the disabled. 
Like the church, the welfare state is con-
cerned with providing the weak with a 
decem minimum. 

In other words, welfare feeds on our 
nostalgia for gentler times--if feudalism can 
be called gentle. As politicians give in to every 
corporate whim, liberals crusade like Biblical 
prophets to raise the poverty line. It's no 
surprise, then, that anti-welfare arguments 
claiming our present system is outdated have 
met with so much success. 

But Ackerman and Alston don't mind 
marker forces, as long as everyone has an 
equal shot at the market: 

As liberals, we believe that each citizen 
Bru('f' AckPrman Anne ALc;tott 
should be free to shape her outcomes as she 
thinks best. But as activist liberals, we 
emphasize the f.lilure of the capitalist system 
to give each citizen an equal opponuniry to 
exercise this freedom as she goes about the 
task of shaping her life. 

Social programs should attack disparities 
in the market, not dean up after the market 
has done its damage. "Our primary focus is 
on the young and energetic, nor the old and 
vulnerable." The authors have made it their 
mission to excise conservativism from liberal 
movements. Politicians will be able ro gut 
welfare as long as it remains an anachronism 
utterly contingent to the main event, the 
Dow Jones Industrial Average. 

The rich man will probably want to 
know why he has any responsibility to make 
things easier for poor teens. What have 
juvenile delinquents ever done for him? To 
begin with, Ackerman and Alstott say no one 
gets to choose his parents. Unless he puts his 
faith in predestination, the rich man must 
admit that it was only his good fortune to be 
born into great fortune. And even if he was 
not born rich, he was most likely born into 
privileges, like a good education. Bur even if 
he had made himself entirely without his 
parents, Ackerman and Alstott argue that the 
market depends on every American's 
participation: "Nobody makes money simply 
on the basis of his own efforts." The public 
already spends billions to preserve the kind of 
social order necessary for free enterprise. 
THE NEW jOURNAL 


"Without billions of voluntary decisions by 
Americans to respect the rights of property in 
their daily lives, the system would collapse 
overnight. All Americans benefit from this 
cooperative activity-but some much more 
than othe~s." As Americans, we have a 
responsibility to our fellow citizens-and, 
perhaps, on the same grounds, to every 
citizen of the world. But that is a project for 
another book. 

To realize Jefferson's dream of life, liberty 
and the pursuit of happiness for all, we must 
first see John Locke's dream through: life, 
liberty and property. "We propose to 
revitalize a very old republican tradition that 
links property and citizenship." This 
connection, as the authors realize, is a 
dangerous one. In older times, for example, 
women were denied suffrage because they 
couldn't own property. That doesn't mean, 
however, that we should rid ourselves of 
private property altogether. On the contrary, 
we should strengthen the property-citizenship 
link by distributing property more equitably. 

The authors refuse to define the members 
of society by their class status, as Marxists do. 
"It is not one's relationship co the means of 
production that should shape tax status but 
the exte)lt to which liberal society has 
honored its promise of equal opportunity." 
John Q. Public is an American, not a Ford 
worker. Indeed, Ackerman and Alstott cake 
special, if subtle, care not to attribute the 
success of capitalism to the exploitation of 
labor. The capitalist's responsibility to his 
worker comes not from the former's 
dependence on the extraction of surplus value 
but from the latter's "voluntary" support of 
the social order. And although the authors 
don't try to refute Marxist claims about class 
struggle, it's as clear now as it was in the Cold 
War: communism is just plain un-American. 

Individual liberties are well and good. But 
who's going to finance them? Ackerman and 
Alstott suggest a twofold plan to raise the 
money, which they estimate at $255 billion a 
year (Social Security and Medicare, by 
contrast, cost $477 billion ). It won't shock 
you to learn that the wealthy will cover most 
of the cost. The richest 41 percent would pay 
an extra 2 percent income cax, a relatively 
small price to thank the plebeians for not 
revolting. Besides, stakeholders would be 
required to return their stakes when they die. 
In real 1999 dollars, an s8o,ooo stake would 
grow to about $250,ooo over 6o years. But 
APRIL 16, 1999 
the stake is not a government loan. If Tom 
decides to blow his stake on hookers and dies 
broke at 22 of a heroin overdose, his estate 
isn't liable for the stake. But successful 
stakeholders will pass a stake on to their 
children, who will receive $8o,ooo at age 21 
like everyone else. 

Freedom is great, but shouldn't we be 
worried about how this money is going to be 
spent? Ackerman and Alstott do take a few 
precautions. Stakeholders have to graduate 
high school, and no one would get all her 
money at once. Instead, she would receive 
four annual payments of about $2o,ooo, 
enough to cover a year of tuition at most 
private colleges. 

In the end, Ackerman and Alstott's 
society is relatively indifferent to so-called 
stakeblowers. What matters to them is that 
everyone has a stake to blow in the first place. 
A liberal society has only one responsibility: 
to provide equal opportunity to every citizen. 
In this respect, the plan is profoundly anti-
utopian. The idea isn't to improve society so 
much as to help it fulfill its moral 
responsibility to its members. 

Will "moral responsibility" alone inspire 
Americans to undertake such a huge project? 
Ackerman and Alstott think so. Citizens will 
rightly believe themselves entitled to their 
stakes. This is not something we do for other 
people; it's not charity for the poor. It is 
rather something we do for ourselves. "When 
our children or grandchildren come forward 
to claim their st.akes, they are doing it for 
themselves and for America: they are 
recognizing their common citizenship and 
gaining the effective freedom to take their 
own projects of self-definition seriously," 
Ackerman and Alstott say. Again and again 
the authors tell us that the stake means more 
than money. Stakeholders: 

will locate themselves in a much larger 
national project devoted to the proposition 
that all men are created equal. By invoking 
this American ideal in theit own case. they 
link themselves not only to all others in the 
past who have taken steps ro realize this fun-
damental principle but also to all those who 
will do so in the future. 

So, despite its anti-utopian rhetoric, Th~ 
Staluholder Soci~ty can't suppress a certain 
utopian glee. In a chapter enthusiastically 
titled "Profiles in Freedom," Ackerman and 
Alstott spin yarns about future stakeholders. 
There's "Brenda" and "Bill," a working-class 
couple. Bill works construction but has 
trouble finding steady work. Brenda is a 
home health aide, but she'd like to train to be 
a nurse. Lucky for them, they share a 
$16o,ooo stake chat allows Bill to go to 
technical school to become a mechanic. 
There's also "Mike" and "Mary Anne." Mike's 
a Teamster who wants to start his own small 
trucking business. Mary Anne wants to 
pursue her college degree. 

At times, The Stakeholder Soci~ty reads 
like a really boring work of fiction, which 
makes sense, given that the book details an 
imaginary social program (real as it may seem 
to its authors). Ackerman and Alstott chortle 
to themselves about the culture of 
stakeholding. New terms like "stakeblower" 
will come into common parlance, we learn. 
Newspapers will brim with tales of how Jane 
Doe made millions with her stake or how Jim 
Jones lost all his money on a single night. It's 
never quite clear why the authors play up 
these banalities. 

But the biggest unanswered question is 
exactly bow any of this could come about. 
The book's underlying premise seems to be, 
"We live in a democracy. Now let's put our 
money where our mouth is." But real 
problems with American democracy can 
easily prevent a plan like this from ever taking 
shape. When the House passed a campaign 
finance reform package last year, for example, 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott 
singlehandedly killed it. What's to stop an 
interested few among the wealthy from 
dismantling any hope of stakebolding? The 
authors hearken back to the New Deal and 
the Gl Bill, two about American projects that 
succeeded. Stakeholding, presumably, is the 
next link. 

It would certainly be nice if all that were 
true. Ackerman and Alstott persuasively 
define American economic success not by the 
Dow Jones Industrial Average buc by equal 
economic opportunity for every citizen. The 
plan is simple and elegant. But for now, we'll 
have to content ourselves with their less-than-
elegant fiction.
