Fifty years ago, the Monsanto Corporation 
produced PCBs, the chemicals that make 
Hudson River stripedhass a-health risk. In the 
1970s, they produced a particularly dangerous 
variety of the defoliant known as Agent 
Orange. In the early 1990s, the corporation 
sold its controversial chemicals unit, cut toxic 
emissions dramatically, began to talk of 
"synergy" and "sustainability," and won more 
enemies than ever. 

As Monsanto spent billions transforming 
into a genetic engineering powerhouse, it 
aroused public disdain on a wide variety of 
issues. The European Union banned 
Monsanto's genetically modified seeds. 
Organic Farmers complained that Monsanto's 
super-pesticides, produced by the plant's very 
own cells, would create breeds of resistant 
super-pests. And worldwide suspicion has 
greeted the company's acquisition of patents 
for the ominously named "terminator 
technology," a genetic engineering technique 
which will protect Monsanto's patented crop 
varieties by insuring that a seed's offspring will 
be infertile. 

Monsanto tried to defuse criticism ~y 
trumpeting its hopes to "feed the world," to 
reduce pesticide use by increasing 
effectiveness. But disaster struck during the 
first week of the ad campaign when Great 
Britain's Prince Charles responded with a well 
publicized endorsement of organic farming 
and a con<!,emnation of genetic engineering. 

Still, the corporation has thus far held on co 
the right to slip genetically engineered crops, 
unannounced, into such staples of the U.S. 
food supply as the McDonald's french fry. 
Terrified chat regulators will slap "Genetically 
Engineered" labels on its produces, Monsanto 
has embarked on a novel public relations 
venture for the new millennium, and the 
name of the game is pathos. 

And so I felt bad for Robert Horsch. The 
diminutive vice president of the Monsanto 
Corporation struggled with a hostile audience 
and a faltering voice on a rainy Wednesday 
afternoon in the Forestry School's gloomy 
Sage Hall. He paused in his discussion of 
corporate synergy and "Spaceship Earth" to 
glance uneasily at the large crowd. He smiled 
plaintively. "I hope there's no pies thrown," he 
said. Horsch had good reason to worry: his 
boss, Monsanto chief Robert Shapiro, took a 
pie in the face a few months ago in San 
Francisco, and Yale environmental activists 
held heated debates over the ethics of pie-
throwing in the weeks preceding Horsch's 
arrival. When the day came, the plant 
botanist-turned-V.P. got off easy-after an 
extended, combative question-and-answer 
period, six undergraduates stormed the stage 
to present him with the "Victor Frankenstein 
Award for Unrestrained Progress in 
Technology." As the protesters launched into a 
skit, Horsch held his award aloft, smiling 
uncertainly, until a silver-haired Forestry 
School administrator took him firmly by the 
arm, confiscated his award and seated him 
along the wall. 

When I arrived the next morning at the 
restaurant on the 19th floor of the Omni 
Hotel, I found Horsch at a small corner table. 
Dressed in a light green shirt and earth-tone 
tie, he bought me yogurt and coffee with the 
air of an uncertain suitor. Then Horsch, a 
man in early middle age with large glasses and 
a quizzical look, set about explaining how it 
feels to be so misunderstood. 

Horsch ruefully remembered the 
optimism that marked the beginning of this 
decade for Monsanto. A denim-shined model 
executive named Robert Shapiro-but 
known, of course, as Bob--moved into the 
position of chief executive from his old post as 
the head of Monsanto's Nutrasweet Group. 
APRIL 16, 1999 
"He is a very thoughtful person. I'd call him a 
philosopher as well as a business leader," 
Horsch said. 

After the expensive, 
counterproductive ad campaign intended co 
improve Monsanto's image, Shapiro lead the 
company into a period of intense self-
examination, Horsch said. 

"Monsanto's position in advertisements 
over the past year has been oversimplified, 
over-stated," Horsch admitted penitently. 

After all, repentence is the first step. 
Monsanto hasn't perfected its new public 
image, he said, but "we're pretty sure it 
involves discussion, listening, engagement." 

And, as it turns out, all is for the best in the 
best of all possible worlds. "The questions 
have triggered a personal journey or 
exploration into the social issues chat, as a 
scientist, I had largely ignored." Now, he 
muses, "I realize science and technology can 
create problems as well as solve problems." 

Naturally.
