Deus ex Machina

The word "machine" is from a word in Greek, a noun that means device. The Greek 
connotes machines, akin to cranes, designed to hoist the actors on and off the stage 
in plays. Euripides, we think, employed machines to float his gods above the mortal 
souls below. Machines like these are best unseen. 
But here the photos stare at three machines. The camera, format large, allows a 
focus sharp. Beneath a cloth, the artist captures gear and blade and groove. 
Which is to say that the machines in these photographs could not be shown in such 
detail were it not for the antique machinery used to create them: the large format 
camera. The camera remains invisible, but just as the antique iambic meter of the 
preceding two paragraphs props up the prose unseen, a literary devise, so does the 
invisible machinery of the selected camera suspend these photographs, like the 
deus ex machina.
