"The Ghetto," like "The Jungle" (Church St. South) and "The Terror 
Dome" (Rockview and Brookside}, serves as a reminder of the city's 
worst drug days. Along with the names come territorial hand signals 
and a stream of young black men who remember when wandering into 
another project likely meant never returning to your own. Back then 
the projects were true ghettos, whose "get tough or get taken" way of 
life forced young men like A.J. Ogman to carry their first guns by age 
twelve. Just four years ago, the fear of dying in Farnam Courts ran so 
high that A.J .'s brother, Bubba, now 21, never left home without a 
bulletproof vest. It saved his life one night when he took six bullets 
meant for someone else. 


But Bubba's mother, Mary Ogman, hasn't heard gun shots in 
Farnam Courts for nearly two years. Both violent crime and drug use 
in the city are down, and most of the project's toughest residents are 
now either dead or in jail. On sunny days, Farnam's walkways fill with 
kids on their bikes and residents chatting with their neighbors. The 
Housing Authority, which constructs and maintains all subsidized 
housing in the city, recently added front stairs and sidewalks to the 
development, and residents have begun to plant small gardens of 
squash and coUard greens in previously unused patches of dirt. Since I 
met Mary in October, the Housing Authority, under the new direction 
of Edward Bland, has also launched several major clean-ups of the area 
and has increased its contact with the Farnam Tenant Representative 
Council (TRC), of which Mary is president. Real progress, however, 
comes slowly. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development (HUD), classified HANH as "troubled" in 1997, and even if 
this classification is dropped after HANH's September 1999 inspection, it 
wiU have taken two years to meet minimum government standards. 


Hope for the future remains high, though, and A.J. Ogman reUs me 
that Farnam Courts is now considered one of the best housing 
developments in the city. But looking at graffiti-scrawled waJls, 
doorways covered in plywood, and an entrance strewn with plastic 
bags and old beer bottles, that isn't saying much. 


''Farnam's looking pretty clean," Bland says as he drives past 
the development in his green Ford Explorer, license plate 
"HANH-x." As the new Executive Director of HANH 
(affectionately pronounced "Hannah" by its staff), Bland spends most 
of his days driving to various sites in the city, checking on the work of 
his crews and listening to residents' concerns. The Housing Authority 
brought Bland to New Haven in January 1998, soon after it was 
classified as "troubled" and lost its HUD funding. While the Housing 
Authority coUects rent from its residents, it relies on federal funding to 
subsidize security, maintenance, and its much-needed Youth Crime 
Prevention and Drug Elimination programs. According to an April 
1998 report from HUD (the most recent statistics available), the number 
of families in need of housing assistance nationaUy has risen to 5Â·3 
million. Federal funding administered by housing authorities provides 
the- only opportunity for qualified families and single elderly an~ 
disabled residents to live decently while paying only 30 percent of thetr 
income, or $25, in rent, without the added cost of utilities. HUD makes 
APRIL 16, 1999 
clear, however, that subsidized housing should not mean substandard 
housing. In a September 1997 HUD inspection, New Haven's Housing 
Authority nearly failed across the board. 


Losing money is not unusual for housing authorities, which 
provide services for low-income families and individuals, but HANH 
had made few effons to coUect rent from residents who weren't paying 
or to fill its vacant units with those who could pay. As its earned 
income fell, HANH turned to HUD for more money. HUD offered 
subsidies and grants for security and drug elimination, but soon found 
HANH's social programs falling grossly behind their goals. Further 
inspection also revealed that HANH's administration had mysteriously 
misaUocated over $2.9 milJion in federal funds. Whether the money 
was disappearing because of inefficiency or into the pockets of HANH 
employees, it wasn't being used to maintain HANH's residential units. 


The Housing Authority's failure to inspect units or to complete work 
orders, even emergency ones, left many residents living in squalor, 
without heat or running water for months at a time. 


The 1997 failure was HANH's fourth in four years, earning the 
Authority a place on Huo's short and infamous list of "troubled" 
agencies. HUD demanded that HANH find a new director and begin 
complying with federal regulations, or face complete termination of its 
employees and dissolution of the entire agency. As a requirement of the 
new classification, control of HANH has moved from the state office in 
Hartford to the new HUD office for "troubled" agencies in Cleveland. 


The Cleveland office, under orders from Washington to monitor the 
New Haven Authority, has cut funding for HANH programs in both 
drug elimination and security provided by extra-duty police officers. 


Bland, HANH's choice for the new director, is considered a 
hardworking, no-nonsense kind of guy by staff and residents. Under 
the control of the 55-year-old former Director of Housing 
Management in Alexandria, Vtrginia, HANH has slowly been earning 
back Huo's trust, and has even regained its funding for the Drug 
Elimination program. While HUD continues to audit the agency every 
two months or so, it seems pleased with Bland's work He has already 
made over 25 staff changes, with still more to come. 


R
elief for residents, though, has been slow to come. The first 
time I visited Mary Ogman, I found her on a bench near the 
end of Franklin St., watching her 15-year-old son, Jack, rake 
leaves into a garbage bag. The walkway he was cleaning was public 
space, the concrete front yard for eleven other Farnam apartments, and 
technicaUy Housing Authority responsibility. Two months earlier the 
Housing Authority, under directions from HUD to cut spending, 
decided to dean Farnam only once a week The Authority has since 
changed that policy and comes to clean the project every weekday, but 
it does lircle to monitor the work of the cleaners and by the weekend 
the project looks nearly as bad as it did before the changes. Broken 
glass and empty beer cans lie near residents' aparonents and dozens of 
white plastic grocery bags rumble along the ground. The crash blows in 
from the highway and other pans of the city, but mainly it comes from 
the residents themselves, who have no trash cans outside their 
7


apartments and rarely take their crash to the 
dumpster in the parking lot. Mary hopes that 
by having Jack clean and set an example for 
other residents, she may alleviate the litter 
problem in Farnam. "Whenever I'm needed I 
try to 6t me and my children in it," she says. 
"These young people who are coming in 
here, you've got to teach them how to clean. 
We need to teach kids to stop thinking of this 
place as garbage. It's only garbage if you allow 
it to become garbage." 


Mary is a heavyset black woman with 
braided hair that shows tufts of white peeking 
from the top. When she walks, she does so 
slowly and with some difficulty. She moved 
into Farnam Courts 13 years ago, after the city 
condemned her previous house. The city also 
condemned and confiscated her furniture, so 
she had to start all over again. When she 
moved to the project, Mary had seven 
children; she's had six more since. A few years 
ago her eldest son died in a motorcycle 
accident. Still, her family has stayed together 
through the hardship, and most live with 
Mary in Farnam Courts. Mary has so many 
people come in and out of her apartment, she 
jokes that she never locks the door: "They 
come in and shout, 'Honey Mom, it's me!' 
and I say, 1\ll right!' I don't know who 'me' is, 
but it must be mine." 


All of her children help out with Mary's 
projecrs in Farnam's residential affairs: Jack 
cleans, AJ. distributes donated food to the 
residents, and one of her daughters is head of 
Edworrl Blond, !he new housing oulhority 
a younger version of the Tenant 
Representative Council which her mother 
runs. Mary got involved with Farnam's TRC as 
soon as she moved into public housing. 
"When I got here I wanted to make a 
difference," she says. The Farnam TRC works 
on the same small issues other TRCS work on 
throughout the city: solving maintenance 
problems or planning 'new 6dd trips for the 
residents. As President of the Farnam TRC, 
Mary presents resident concerns and plans to 
the Executive Direcror. Her big projecr this 
year is the learning center, which will take 
over Farnam's old community building. The 
center will feature day care, GED classes, and 
computer training (Bland's idea). Mary hopes 
to merge the technological learning with 
spiritual and moral learning. "I want to get a 
videotape of Jesus, you know, the cartoon, 
and show it on a Wednesday," she says. "We 
don't want to lose another generation of kids 
to disrespectfulness." 


Disrepect seemed the least of Mary's 
concerns as she watched Jack clean the yard. 
She worried that the Housing Authority was 
spending too much time correcting mistakes 
of the past, that Bland was not the kind of 
"people-person" who paid attention to what 
residents truly wanted: a livable environment 
and dependable security. She looked up to see 
Jack leaning against a tree, a pained 
expression on his face. Mary laughed, which 
she does a lot, and her eyes scrunched up 
tight, "Don't just stand there, Jack. Get 
THE NEW JouRNAL 


another bag and start working." Jack pushed 
himself off the tree and plodded upstairs to 
Mary's apartment. After all, he does clean up 
the neigbborhood for free. Mary laughed, 
"When I-feed him, that's his payment." 


E
dward Bland's salary comes from HUD, 
roughly $95,000 a year. He also gets the 
company car and a spacious office 
overlooking Audubon Court in downtown 
New Haven. Inside the HANH building, 
Bland's executive reception area is big enough 
to house at least three other offices; as it is, 
the office comfortably accommodates rwo 
secretaries and a duster of several couches. In 
Bland's office, a map of New Haven stands in 
center view. To the right of the map is his 
desk, and behind the desk every so often is 
Bland-a tall, grandfatherly black man with 
round glasses, white hair and a mustache. 


Growing up in Vienna, Maryland, a farm 
community of fewer than 500, Bland never 
dreamed of working in urban housing 
development. He graduated college with a 
B.A. in Social Sciences and French, worked as 
a schoolteacher, served in the Army and the 
Boy Scouts, and then happened to become 
friends with a recruitment officer from the 
Baltimore Housing Authority. From 
Baltimore he made his way through cities and 
promotions, moving from Baltimore to 
Columbus and on to Alexandria, Virginia, 
before finally landing his first Executive 
Directing position in New Haven-a city he 
had never seen. 


Bland is only one of a number of city-
hopping officials who make up the top 
management in housing authorities across the 
country. Dependent almost entirely on 
federal funds, the housing authorities that 
provide the bulk of housing for inner-city 
residents across the country have virtually no 
formal ties with their affiliated city. The city 
government is not required to give political or 
monetary support to its housing authority, 
and in turn, the housing authority has no 
obligation to respect the wishes of the city. 
The top directors and property managers in 
housing authorities move from city to city 
solving problems and troubleshooting, a club 
of super-housing players. Membership in the 
club requires expertise, but not necessarily in 
the specific problems each city presents. 


The specific problem Bland faced as I 
followed him one day was with a Section 8 
house on Blatchley Avenue. Usually Section 8
