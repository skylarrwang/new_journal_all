Off the Beaten Path! 
The Marquis de Sod take a beat ing, 
but will t hey keep on seeding? 
by julia Kqrdon 
T
hese recent halcyon days, as I walk from Old Campus to join 
the hourly flood of Yalies flowing across Elm Street co Cross 
Campus, I leave a peaceful world of expensive green sod and 
enter the theater of a small war. The first sign of battle appears as I pass 
through the Porter gace t<? Cross Campus: a long, dusty scar gouged in 
the grass runs the length of che scone walk. Ac che end of che first 
Berkeley wall (a battlefield in itself) the full ravages of the· struggle are 
revealed as Ground Zero comes into view. Two intersecting swaths of 
pitted, bare earth cue through the meager grass of che lower Cross 
Campus lawn, signs of the feet that leave the sanctioned scone paths 
for a tempting shortcut. 

Disturbed by this silent struggle at the heart of Yale's campus, I 
stood ac the corner of Cross Campus one morning to question the 
perhaps unwitting aggressors. Most peop1e, understandably, claimed 
that saving time was the reason for their trespass. Still, the reasoning of 
some stood out. The first person I accosted coming across the scarred 
lawn offered a formal geometric proof, explaining at length how the 
diagonal through the grass was the hypotenuse of the triangle of his 
daily path. The next person I stopped, cutting the corner at an 
intersection of the walks, was less a strategist than a follower, saying he 
did it "because [the grass] was already trampled on." He exhibited a 
disjunction between thought and action that I suspect exisrs in the 
minds of most of the grass oppressors: when asked if he would answer 
some questions about the Cross Campus grass, he told me, "It needs 
some, chat's what you should say!" 

Back on Old Campus, I spoke to a gardener raking the grass co 
find out about defense strategies. According to him, spring '98 was the 
lase time Grounds and Maintenance brought out the artillery-
machines that spray "hydroseed," a high-tech mixture of grass seed and 
fertilizer. They barricaded the seeded lawn, buc "stakes and ropes aren't 
going to keep [the students] from crossing the grass," he said. Since 
then, Yalies' determinacion to find a shorter route and the 
encroachment of the Berkeley renovation upon the grass has caused 
Grounds and Maintenance to give up resistance, at least temporarily. 
"It's a big political thing. It makes us look bad. My boss doesn't want 
to buy seed, and his boss is yelling ac him because of the condition of 
the grass," the gardener volunteered, and then asked to remain 
anonymous, fearing retaliation if it became known that he had 
volunteered this intelligence. His boss, Supervisor of Grounds and 
Maintenance John Kul, claimed that the Berkeley renovation is the 
reason for the neglect of Cross Campus. He admitted that "it's sore of 
been a forgotten area in the past year," but maintained that there are 
plans for a renovation within the next year. 

Roberto Meinrath, deputy director of Yale's Office of Facilities, 
gave me a litcle history of the Grass Wars. Apparently, the destruction 
of Cross Campus lawn is merely ·a single instance in a pattern of 
aggression by Yale students. "When che good Old Campus was in 
good old pretty bad shape, we could keep volleyball and soccer off 
Cross Campus," he told me, saying that these activities and events like 
Spring Fling made traditional attempts co protect the grass completely 
futile. Meinrath seemed resigned to hi~ defeat in the defense of the 
grass, saying "there's no point in continuing to try to fight the never-
ending war of keeping students off the grass." Instead of continuing 
the fight, the Office of Facilities has chosen the strategy of 
appeasement: the upcoming renovations will include two new 
crosswalks roughly approximating the swaths of lawn worn to bare 
earth and a complete replacement of the grass on both the upper and 
lower lawns, an overhaul with an estimated cost of up to $Ioo,ooo. 

I figured chis was a rather large defense budget to use essentially on 
grass, so I decided co investigate just how much time cutting through 
Cross Campus saves. At a moderate pace, using the stone walks to 
travel along two sides of the lawn to the opposite corner took 58 
seconds; walking along the worn diagonal across the grass took 48 
seconds. This is a savings of ten seconds, about the amount of time it 
takes a Yale student to say "lt's okay. I'm caking ic Credit/0/Fail." But 
this doesn't seem like a ten seconds any of the people I spoke with 
really needed, since they all agreed to talk to me. A few calculations 
involving these ten seconds may be illuminating. Spreading the price 
of the renovation over a year, and allowing for one trip, ten seconds 
faster, per day, per Yalie, Yale is valuing its students' time spent walking 
to class at about $40 an hour. If walking across campus were a 40 hour 
a week, 50 week a year job, it would pay on the order of s8o,ooo a 
year. But such spendthrift ways seem common co all institutions with 
more money than they could possibly need. Just look at the U.S. 
Department of Defense-<lo they really need s4oo toilet seats and 
two-billion dollar bombers co fight their own wars?
