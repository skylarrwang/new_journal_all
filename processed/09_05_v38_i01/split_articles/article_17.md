speech-writing staff, had in fact 
already emailed Urbahn to commend 
him for his plucky biweekly column, 
which marked its author out as a 
• 
dogged anomaly on a liberal campus. 


At a Yale-in-Washington dinner later 
in the summer, Michel said that, like 
many of his fellow young alumni, he 
still trolls the YDN and keeps an eye 
out for good writers like U rbahn. In a 
sense, Michel is just returning the 
favor: At the same dinner, he 
explained that he got his job when a 
member of the ·YDN alumni board 
put him in touch with a Yale alum 
working in the White House, who 
helped hhn to get an internship in 
speech-writing and 
then, a 
few 
months later, to turn the internship 
r into a staff position. The reason for 
· that help, and its iffiplication, was not 
lost on Michel . 


"If you go to Yale and you're con-
servative~· you're part of a group that is 
I' 
especially small. I think there's that 
drive to hire people and help people 
along," explained U rbahn. "There's a 
sense that I 
know what you're 
going through." 


White, who left his fiUD job in 
August to become the assistant editor 
of AEI's in-house magazine, agreed. 
"Most Y alies are willing to go out on a 
limb for other Yalies, even people 
you've never met before. And proba-
bly especially wirh conservative Yalies, 
because there aren't as many of us, so 
if we want to fill up DC with like-
minded Y alies we have a smaller pool 
to pull from." 


And with that as their bond, Yale 
conservatives 
will 
find 
that in 
Washington, they are not alone. 


**Title: IN GOOD CoMPANY**

wo features of Yale's con-. 
servatism 
consolidated 
undergraduate institutions, 
and the catalyzing effects of 
minority status 
find an 
almost 
uncanny 
reflection 
in 
Washington. This summer, few topics 
seemed as in vogue among lefti~t 
organizers as the right's edge in culti-
vating young leaders, and the left's 
need to play catch up. Conservative 
organizations like Heritage, The Cato 
Institute, 
The 
Project 
for 
the 
American Century, and the Inter-
Collegiate Institute have been preen-
ing college-aged conservatives for 
decades. In the 1960s and '70s, 
Buckley's Young America Foundation 
did the 
same thing, channeling 
resources to conservative student 
groups on campuses. across the coun-
try. These organizations were intend-
ed to counteract the liberal onslaught 
Buckley had trumpeted years earlier, 
but by now, they have a two decade 
head start. 


The Heritage Institute, with its 75-
student internship program is a 
Washington 
standout: 
well-estab-
lished, well-funded and, best of all, 
chock full of true believers 
the old 
alongside the young. And this sum-
mer, it had the good fortune to attract 
a recent Yale graduate who, in the pre-
vious four years, had plenty of impe-
tus to reflect on his conservative 
views: Brian Christiansen. 


Christiansen spent the summer at 
Heritage interning for Edwin Meese 
III, a constitutional law scholar and 
fellow 
Yale 
alumnus, 
compiling 


research and writing a position paper 
that will help Heritage establish its 
stance on prisoners' rights at the mili-
tary base where Christiansen once 
lived, Guatanamo Bay. The program, 
which he described as "half intern-
ship, half school," was an eye-opener: 
Christiansen discovered a whole 
movement, rooted in Reagan conser-
vatism, to counteract the leftward tilt 
on college campuses that had hit him 
in the face in a Farnam dorm room 
four years earlier. Intellectually, . it 
engaged him as few classes or forums 
at Yale had 
though, of course, Yale 
had a big effect on his experience. His 
internship was funded with a fellowship 
from his Yale fraternity, Zeta Psi, and he 
says he is a better writer and researcher 
because of his time there. He added 
amused, "Sometimes I'll say stuff and 
people will write it off like, he's been 
brainwashed at liberal Yale.'' 


His time at Heritage taught 
Christiansen a few things about liberal 
Yale too. In June, The New York Times 
published a high-profile article on the 
J 
' 
Heritage program, which mentioned 
Christiansen's name and said that · he 
was happy to have reprieve from the 
"liberal ethos" at Yale. Afterwards, he 
began receiving calls and emails from 
other Yale graduates who had looked 
up his contact information in the 
alumni directory. "They just wanted to 
congratulate me on what I'm doing," 
Christiansen recalled in August. As 
one of the quiet conservatives at Yale, -
he was shocked to find he had so 
much company. "I a1most feel like 
there's this secret cell of conservatives 
who you don't know about," he mar-
veled. "I thought I was one of like ten 
conservatives." 


Apparently, the people whq called 
him thought the same thing. They fig-
ure Christiansen is unique at Yale, just 
like they once were. And but for his 
time at Heritage, Christiansen would 
still agree with them.

TANKS: 
CONVINCING 
C ASES, SMILING FACES**

nterning at a posh DC think-
tank can do more than unite stu-
dents of a political feather. 
Christiansen estimates that 
when he applied to Heritage, only 
sixty percent of his responses to 
application questions were in accord 
with the Institute's positions. On a 
few crucial issues, like affirmative 
action, he was at odds. But over 
lunch at the Capital Hill Brewery on 
the last day of his internship, he 
admitted that the careful case 
Heritage had presented against 
affirmative action was hard to 
refute. Now, he says, he sees the 
problems with the policy he had 
supported. 


Jonathan Swanson, a Heritage intern 
last sutnmer, recounts a similar near-
transformation on the issue of gay 
marriage. He explained, "It's not indoc-
trination, it's just really persuasive." 


At most think tanks, interns act as 
researchers for the institute's full-time 
scholars, finding mentors and making 
contacts in the process. Juliet Squire, a 
two-summer AEI intern, describes the 
program as akin to "a three-month 
long interview process," one that 
brings many interns back for a position 
on the staff. Her co-intern, Matthew 
Ciesielski, objects to the characteriza-
tion of AEI's internship program as a 
Republican Party feeder ("I'm not sure 
the kids think of it that way; it's not like 
they're be · 
· gin single-A and they'll 
be in the pros in twenty years."), but he 
agrees that the ties, like the experience, 
are helpful. 


Jonathan Swanson can testify to the 
potency of those ties. As a junior, he 
applied twice to intern at the White 
House, both titnes unsuccessfully. Last 
summer, 
he 
landed 
a 
Heritage 
Foundation internship ... instead. With 
Heritage on his resmne, his third White 
House internship application was 
accepted, and he spent last fall as an 
intern at the National Economic 
Council at the White House. Back at 
Yale in the spring for' his second-to-last 
semester, Swanson began organizing 
students around the same issue he had

worked on for while there: adding pri-
vate accounts to social security. When 
he returned to DC for a second sum-
mer, this time to manage the group he 
had co-founded, Students to Save 
Social Security (S4), Swanson began to 
cash in on his earlier contacts. Heritage 
staffers provided hiin and his student 
colleagues with advice on eve 
· g 
from getting an op-ed into the. paper 
("If you say you have twelve chapters 
in an editor's state, that helps.") to 
attracting more media coverage ("The 
media wants something to take a pic-
ture o£ I never would've thought that 
of that."). Heritage even arranged for 
the group to do a free media training 
session with the National Leadership 
Institute 
complete with television 
cameras, live callers, and professional 
producers to .critique the students on 
their_ fauX: guest appearances. 


"Little things like that are really prac-
tical,',' S~;mson said later. ''There was 
one guy in our group who's really artic-
ulate but on camera he never smiled. 
They told hirn that." 


To date, the group has opened chap-
ters at over 150 colleges, staged a 
demonstration outside the Capital, 
enjoyed modest fundraising success, and 
scored an invitation to the White House. 
Swanson himself was the focus of an 
August Washington Post at ~de about up-
and-coming political organizers. 


Like a lot of people, the Yale sen-
ior concluded that the heightened 
youth recruittnent and training efforts 
he witnessed from Republicans were 
no aberration. The right is simply bet-
ter organized overall. A key break-
through in Swanson's development of 
S4 came when he wrangled a speaker's 
spot at Grover Norquist's famous 
Wednesday morning meeting, an 
essential weekly stop for conservative 
strategists and politicians in DC. 


Swanson told the group about his 
organization and asked for any help 
people at the meeting could offer. 
''Afterwards people were coming 
around" 
here Swanson raised his
