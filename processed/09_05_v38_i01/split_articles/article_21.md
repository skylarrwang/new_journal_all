Sabbath has the potential to be a 
social hindrance. "It is personal 
what is in the spirit of Shabbat," 
says Zvika. He considers "hang-
ing out" on Friday night okay, but 
he draws the line at parties or 
events with music or electricity, 
opting for more laid-back Shomer 
S habbos-friendly fetes. Zvika, a 
founding 
brother 
of 
Alpha 
Epsilon Pi 
a popular Jewish fra-
ternity at Yale established two 
years ago 
is trying to be a model 
of an observant yet hip Orthodox 
Jew. "It's hard to argue that get-
ting drunk is against the Torah," 
he says with fraternal spirit. He 
may not consider himself socially 
r 
restrict~d, but non-Jews and Jews 
alike might see some of Zvika's 
choices 
thpugh he is 
a 
frat 
boy 
as sociaJlir :'limiting. 

In cohtrast, Josh seems to 
avoid most mainstream social 
events. Sarah is still dealing with 
the issue of whether or not to go 
out on Friday nights. "I am still 
trying to find what I feel comfort-
able with in my Jewish routine," 
she says. But for each of them, 
these are difficult decisions. 

After deferring his matricula-
tion to spend a year in I-srael, 
Z vika decided to become S homer 
Negfyah, a rite that forbids him to 
touch females before he consum-
mates 
his 
marriage. 
As 
he 
explains: "When I got to Yale I 
told everyone about it. I made a 
big deal about it. It was easier that 
way because it was a big deal-
"'Oh, you're the guy who can't 
touch girls!'" Zvika and Josh, who 
is also Shomer Negfyah, do not face 
anything Orthodox men of the 
past were not used to. In the late 
1980s, Rabbi Shlomo Shu1man faced 
sin1iJar challenges as he grew into his 
Orthodoxy, also incorporating S homer 
Negjyah into his undergraduate life. 
He offers an anecdote about the diffi-
culty of appreciating S homer Neg!yah 
September 2005 
on a co-ed campus: "There was a 
somewhat promiscuous woman ·who 
hugged someone and then yelled to 
me, 'I can't hug you, you're Shomer 
Negjyah.' 
I did not want to hug her 
anyways ... ·but because she said that, I 
thought I should be more careful. 
Shomer Negjyah was a mitzvah I did not 
fully realize until I graduated." 

One 
milestone 
Rabbi 
Shulman's journey to Orthodoxy 
traces the recent historical pres-
ence of Orthodox Judaism in the 
Yale community. He nostalgically 
recalls that when he joined the 
Kosher _Kitchen in the fall of . 
1987, it was located in the base-
ment of 305 Crown Street. "My 
job was to be in charge of the 
bagel brunches. 
I was proud of 
them. I would bribe people to 
drive me to Manhattan, but we 
always made a lot of money," he 
recalls jocularly. The establish-
ment of a Kosher Kitchen, how-
ever makeshift, was a step in the 
right direction. A turning paint 
came eight years later in 1995 
when the ribbon was cut to open 
the Slifka center on Wall Street, 
finally a monument of the influ-
-ence of Judaism at Yale. For 
Rabbi Shulman, Slifka is the 
promised land; and Crown Street 
was a struggling kibbutz in the 
desert. "Then, it was us against 
the world fighting for survival," as 
Shulman describes. "The minyan 
was very hamish)" he says, noting 
the beauty of its simplicity and 
hominess; "and I hope they don't 
lose that now being that it is fancy 
and beautiful." 


ecently, Rabbi Shulman 
felt stirred to become a 
new presence on campus, 
one decisively aimed at reviving 
religion as a force in the lives of 
the University's Jewish students. 
With his partner and wife Aviva, 
he founded a Yale branch of a

nationally-funded Jewish educa-
tional program geared towards 
reconnecting Jewish college stu-
dents with their rich religious her-
itage. Every Tuesday night last 
semester, he eagerly commanded a 
second floor classroom of Linsly-
Chittenden Hall to show a batch 
of students how Judaism is inte-
gral to the practical aspects of 
everyday life. Participants received 
a $500 stipend. 

Last year's group, a small, 
hand-picked assortment of gradu-
ate and undergraduate students, 
all Jewish, many only by birth, 
received Rabbi Shulman's words 
with the finesse of true Yalies. 
They questioned. They probed. 
They learned. They refuted. They 
argued. They dismissed. They 
accepted 
hesitantly. 
They 
probed again. Prominent profes-
32 
sionals 
from 
the 
national 
Orthodox community visited as 
lecturers to discuss the spiritual 
and material value -of leading an 
Orthodox life. Shabbaton week-
end trips to Rabbi Shulman's 
homogenous Orthodox neighbor-
hood in Waterbury, · Connecticut 
offered an on-site glimpse into the 
nuances of Orthodox life in the 
real world. Students lived with 
other rabbis and their families for 
a weekend, experiencing the cus-
tom and emotion of the Sabbath 
first-hand. 

Through all of these initiatives, 
Rabbi Shulman hopes to prepare stu-
dents for Jewish life, something that at 
best, Yale can do only half-heartedly. 
''Mairnonides has given me a greater 
appreciation for the gift of life and 
God's presence in the world," says 
Michael Rucker, a graduate of the pro-
gram. "But, there are still many ques-
tions that have not been answered for 
me. I am a true believer in openness to 
new ideas and people and I feel that any 
conservative belief system is dangerous. 
Although Judaism allows for question-
ing, which is very important and differ-
ent than most conservative ideologies, a 
strict religious doctrine causes sepa-
ratism no matter how you look at it." 

Rabbi Shultnan is teaching skeptical Jews 
about the importance of sacrifice in the 
name of religion. And this s~mester his 
mission continues. He may not succeed 
in cultivating a new generation of 
Orthodox Jews, but he is reinforcing the 
existence of that community at Yale and 
in the world.
