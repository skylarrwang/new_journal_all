ROPES ARE STRETCHED, COILED, AND 
knotted, holding mast to deck to prow to 
stern and you can hear the slow creaking 
as ropes adjust to the shifting water and 
wind. Everyone aboard is tou · 
rope. 

little girls examine thick ropes, frayed and 
hardened by sun and salt. At the prow, a 
man drapes himself over the anchor, 
clenching the knot ·on top and leaning 
hard into the wind. 

It takes most of the 
people 
aboard the schooner to set the sails. They 
line up with feet planted apart and grab 
the rope with both hands, preparing for a 
game of tug-of-war against the immense 
mast. Two of the crew members station 
themselves 
Monica at the throat, Eve at 
the peak and start shouting directions. 
Heave! 
Hold the line! 
Everyone throws the weight of their bod-
ies back and forth, mimicking the rocking 
of waves, and the heavy mast slowly 
groans upward. More ropes are unfas-
tened; white sails, unleashed, whip out 
and bulge against the wind. 

As a woman knots and coils up ends 
of rope, Captain Bill Pinkney, the portrait 
of a seaman white beard, enormous 
glasses, baseball cap, gold hoop earring'--
saunters above deck and urges us to gath-
er around to hear the tale of the Amistad, 
which has just pulled out of the pier at 
Long Wharf and away from the sounds 
of I-95. Pinkney punctuates his sentences 
with sharp exaggerated hand gestures, as 
if he is conducting a rather obstinate and 
near-sighted symphony orchestra. 1bis 
story is very important, his hands seem to 
say as they conjure a trove of tales from a 
lost sea world; pay attention. Gradually, 
all of ·the passengers move in doser, 
drawn into the mesmerizing rh 
· his words. 

The story of the Amistad, he explains, 
is the story of Sengbe Pie~ one of 53 
Mende captives aboard 
the small 
schooner when it set sail for Cuba in 
1839. As the story goes, one day Sengbe 
went to the cook to ask for more food. 
The cook's response was to drag two 
fingers across his neck and point at 
the cooking pot Sengbe believed 
that his captors were planning to 
kill and eat the captives, and rushed 
back to inform the others. With lit-
tle hope of survival, the . group 
' 
decided to fight for its freedom. 

Using a steel nail pried from a plank, 
the captives managed to pick the lock 
on the chains that bound them below 
deck each night They discovered that the 
cargo bins they had been chained above 
were conveniently full of long, sharp 
sugar-cane knives. Armed, the captives 
stormed above deck and seized control of 
the Amistad, hacking the captain to death. 

Unable to operate a ship, they conunand-
ed the two remaining crew members to 
sail toward the sunrise in order to return 
home to Africa. 

During the day, the two Spaniards 
dutifully sailed east towards the sunris~ 
but at night, when the captives could not 
tell which direction was east, they used 
their compasses to sail north instead. 
Rather than sailing towards Africa, the 
ship moved steadily towards New York 
and eventually ended up at Montauk 
Point The ship was never contacted by 
another vessel, because it looked like a 
pirate ship. 

When the Amistad finally reached 
America, the two Spaniard captains sail-
. ing it demanded full property rights of 
the ship and its human cargo. The case 
reached the Supreme Court, where John 
Quincy Adams argued for six hours 
straight on behalf of the captives. He 
eventua11y secured their freedom, a mira-
cle considering that seven of the nine jus-
rices owned slaves or resided in a slave 
state. The decision was one of the first 
judicial triumphs for human rights. The 
Mende setded in Fartnington, Cf, where 
a church group taught them English and 
helped them readjust to the cornmunity. 
When 
the 
Mende raised 
enough money, . they hired a ship and 
· sailed home. 

As Captain Pinkney's hand gestm:es 
become even grander as he approaches 
the finale of his oration, he explaines why 
is so special: It brings people 
together, in physical and spiritual proxim-
ity. All types of people come aboard the 
'i!m.'St. 
during its public sai1s 
today in 
the Ehn Oty as it travels up and down 
the coast. Surrounded by open water, the 
schooner becomes home, prison, and 
means of escape; New Haveners are its 
captives. 

Strangers wander around the 
sma11 deck during the three-hour sail, so 
close that they brush against each other as 
they situate their bodies to the fi 
waves. Tl 
er, they operate the ship 
using the leverage of their combined 
weight. They all listen to the tale of the 
original Amistad's maiden voyage, a story 
of people reco 
· · 
in each other the 
cotnmon trait of humanity and through 
this recognition learning to help and 
understand each other. As they sail home 
against the backdrop of a sky faded pur-
ple, streaked with livid pink and orange, 
they find it easy to believe in Captain 
Pinkney's message. The ship seems much 
louder as it retu tns to the wharf, filled 
with the murmured conversations of 
people who have just met, even if they are 
about to get on the highway.
