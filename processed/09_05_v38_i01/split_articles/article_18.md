last four decades. In 1964, when 
. 
. the GOP's conservative wing final-
ly marked its ascertdancy by nomi-
nating ultra-right winger Barry 
Goldwater, 
the 
Democrats 
trounced them in all but six states. 
Buckley predicted the defeat; even 
before the results were in, he was 
encouraging his party to look ahead 
to the next battle. It wasn't until 
1980 .that far-right conservatives 
like Buckley found an ideological 
. peer in the White House. In the 
meantime, the party rallied around 
its self-image as the embattled 
underdog. Today, Republicans con-
trol the White House, both houses 
of Congress, and over half of gov-
ernorships 
but the back-to-the-
wall fighting spirit developed in the 
1960s and '70s still appears, for 
political purposes, like the gift that 
keeps on givirig. 
Most likely the movement to 
change that philosophy won't origi-
22 
nate at Yale. Here, unlike in the 
country at large, conservatives' 
sense of embattlement is often 
quite justified, and it has been for 
decades. Buckley felt it in 19 50. In 
1980, Steven Calabrasi, the founder 
of the Federalist Society, did too; 
he claims that he resolved to estab-
lish the conservative lawyers' asso-
ciation one day in a .Yale Law 
School classroom when he was one 
of only two in a class of 90 to say 
he had voted for Ronald Reagan; 
When he arrived at . Yale two

experience was almost identical. 
For most middle-of-the-road 
Yale liberals, no experience in a 
Yale dorm- or classroom is likely to 
be as catalyzing as this. If their 
conservative peers are correct, far 
too many of them simply assume 
that everyone · is basically liberal-
. or, at least, that· they would be if 
they thought about it a little more.

Edelman, the director of the 
Yale-in-Washington 
program, 
thinks that is how the summer 
events calendar ended up with such 
a high proportion of conservative 
speakers, relative to Yale's typical 
bias. "Bill Kristol's office will call 
us back in a day, whereas James 
Carville won't give us the time of 
day," Edelman complained midway 
through 
summer. 
Far-left 
celebrities are hard to come by, he 
explained, and even those who are 
well known 
like Carville, a promi-
nent Democratic strategist and 
author 
are not necessarily very 
convincing. He thinks their failure 
lies in their refusal to engage the 
opposition on equal terms, prefer-


ring as they do to highlight its illog-
ic. Part of the problem may lie in 
the inherent differences between 
conservative and liberal ideologies; 
while the right can coalesce around 
a finite set of axiomatic beliefs, 
easily conveyed and universally 
applicable,. the left is by nature less 
coherent, more like a federation 
attempting to speak the aims of 
disparate citizens than a centralized 
state in which shared aims ar·e the 
uniting factor. But if that charac-
terization is accurate, liberals ought 
to have more cause for substantive 
debate, not less. And they should 
be able to refute conservative argu-
ments with considerably more 
nuance. 
A lot · of conservative under-
graduates, 
like 
Christiansen, 
would 
welcome 
change. 
Calling President Bush an idiot, 
they argue, is no substitute for 
spirited intellectual discussion
