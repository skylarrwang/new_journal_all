into the only restaurant in town, I 
stuck out like an iguana in a bowl of 
marshmallows. 

Everyone 
knew 
everyone, and I had to be ready to 
listen 
maybe even interject if I 
were bold enough 
to the town 
gossip bursting with scandal: The 
same terrible things people do to 
each other everywhere. 

People in small towns live in his-
toric districts. There is always a rail-
road or a river carrying coal-loaded 
reminders of industry and progress. 
The older residents lead slow-paced 
lives and wield a sepia-stained wis-
dom that could never mature in a 
city bustling with billboards, trends, 
and state-of-the-art technological 
devices. These small towns don't 
even get cell phone reception. Many 
of the residents work the land, and a 
good way to find a centuries-old 
farmhouse is to look for a sign by a 
mailbox advertising eggs. You have 
to drive slowly on the dirt driveway 
though, so as not to run over the 
chickens 
that 
will 
eventually 
feed you. 

I met Marjorie this way. She gave 
me a handful of eggs (which I later 
cooked on my camping stove at the 
back of a bank parking lot 
very 
September 2005 
Dharma Bums) and recalled one fasci-
nating story aJter another: child-
hood misadventures with her sis-
ter 
who lived just a mile or two 
• 
thataway 
on the farm they grew up 
on, which was about fifteen miles 
thisaway. 

Marjorie's nephew lives 
there now with · his wife and four 
kids. 

During our conversation, 
someone knocked softly on the rick-
ety screen door. It was one of

Marjorie's grandsons, who often vis-
its her to play with the baby chickens 
in a cardboard box in the backroom. 

As I hopped into my car and 
drove off, I reached for my note-
book to record a testament to 
Marjorie. Again, I felt strained by 
my pen's 1inutations, but I had to 
memorialize her in some way before 
my car traveled too far. By sunset, I 
would have reached this big city or 
that hip college town with the week-
ly arts paper unfolded in my lap. 

Often, the name of a certain street 
' 
. ' 
or neighborhood caught my atten-
tion, and I sought to find it. Diverse 
contingents thrive in every town. I 
met small-town types and big-city 
types, Midwesterners and Pacific 
Northwesterners, the college sort 
and the "bad at school" sort; they're 
all different, yet I could relate to 
them in a bizarrely similar way. 

They offered me their stories, and I 
offered them a few of mine, and I 
began to suspect that the repetition 
I faced in my encounters was a testa-
ment to a common sympathy for the 
human experience.

No matter where I went, the 
conversations 
occurred-
famously and less-famously 
. . 
~ ,.· 
over-discussed topics. 

Weather is 
the obvious one. It's muggy in New 
Orleans, and it rains in Portland; I 
could 
describe 
a 
million 
"mishaps" 
ruined gardens, sore 
hipbones, braying animals 
all trig-
gered by the weather. Everyone 
seems to consistently share certain 
pieces of information more readily 
than others. 

Money. Everyone likes to talk 
about money. I know more salaries 
and rents and good deals than I 
could ever use in a lifetime. Jordan

pays $550 a month for his room in a 
four-person apartment. Alice pays 
$180. 

That . boy 
in 
Northern 
California saved $1500 to buy a 
motorcycle. An acre of land outside 
of Taos, New Mexico costs $1200. 
Larry bought his solar panel for just 
under $300 on eBay. If Scott works 
full-time for a week, he can take 
three weeks off and still pay rent 
no 
and have enough money to spend on 
food. Jacob pays $250 rent. Or 
maybe the entire apartment is $250, 
and Jacob pays $125 of it. It's qne 
detail I can't exactly remember. 

Sometimes, discussions of 
finances led to a discussion of my 
· own travels. Doesn't it cost a lot to 
drive around? Where do you get gas 
44 
money? 

"Yale gave me enough money to 
pay for my trip." 

How much? 

"Six-thousand dollars." 

· 

"You got $6000 to drive around 
the country?! Where's the catch?" 

"There isn't one." . 

"Yeah, hut what do you have to 
do?"

"I told them I'd write a play. But, 
that's not what I have to do. What I 
have to do is prove that I used the 
money to travel around the country 
in my car. Just like I'm doing." I 
don't like to tell them that they will 
end up as a page in my notebook or 
the 
phone 
numbers 
and 
addresses they give me will end up 
r 
•• 
piled on a growing stack of the 
same. Nor do I tell them that they 
may or may not be the inspiration 
for that play that I will put on in the 
fall, or that it's possible that I will 
forget them tomorrow or remember 
them forever. 

Another frequent topic was poli-
tics. Eric sat on a barstool next to me 
in New Orleans and insisted that I 
ouseJ no 
needed to "shut Yale down" in order 
to prove that th~ nation's president is 
an idiot, a protest that would surely 
end the war in Iraq. Adam wanted to 
hide behind his bong· and keep tabs 
on what was going on around his 
room 
not the country. Kyle associ-
ated Yale with George W. Bush and 
wanted to know if everyone there is 
"like that." 

''Well, I'm cer-
tainly not a younger 
female version of 
the. president." 

"No, apparent-
ly 
you 
aren't, 
they'd reply. 

For 
one, you're making 
your 
way 
alone 
around the coun-
try, risking danger 
from terrorists and 
serial killers. You 
naven't met any of 
yet, 
have 
you?" 

"Nope." 

''No creeps? I 
wouldn't trust pea-
. ple these days." 

''You can recog-
nize them."

"I'm just saying, 
be careful. Doesn't 
anyone worry about 
you or 
anything? 
Don't you get scared 
and lonely?" 

"I'm having the 
tirne of my life right 
now. Even when I'm 
sitting in my car by 
myself, I can turn the 
music up really loud 
and roll the windows 
down and watch the 
countryside pass by 
like a moving land-
scape painting. It's 
perfect." 

I'm lucky, they 
tell me. My life, they 
/ 
say, is perfect. No 
hou·s5!,. ·no_ pets, no 
boyfti~·~, no job, 
and 'a· .• Y-ale educa-

world 
must be at your feet. 

Now, as I glance 
back at the red note-
book 
sprawled 
across my backseat 
like a sleeping passenger, its p ages 
plastered with sketches, anecdotes, 
and quotes from · the people I've 
met, I fantasize and fear what they 
would write about me. 

I was somewhere south of 
Chestnut, Illinois when I made the 
connection between this fear and 
the unavoidability of forcing my 
new acquaintances 1nto stereo-
types. I had just passed the after-
noon outside a small-town gas sta-
tion discussing life, the universe, 
and everything else with 65-year 
old Bob. 

As I drove away, the 
thought of compacting him into a 
few paragraphs nearly moved me 
to tears. 

While turning onto the high-
way, I questioned my notebook, 
my method, my journey. 

I had 
spent the summer playing the 
role of a cultural an thropologist 
, but I don't think I'll ever be 
capable of boiling a 
human 
being like Bob d own to a few 
bullet points after kn owing him 
for a fe·w minutes o r hours or 
~ 
even years. 

A cross A m enca, I 
found parallels in d emeanor, 
conversation, and even cooking 
technique. 

These p arallels did-
n't justify the categoriz ation of 
my new friends, however; they 
only 
proved 
their 
c o mmon 
humanity. And why was I always 
trying to reduce real experience 
to 
bite-size 
c o cktail 
_party 
soundbytes? 

Was this the skill 
Yale 
had 
taught 
me? 

Couldn't I just le t life unfurl? 

After spending three days with 
Josh, a young man I tnet in Boulder, 
Colorado, I found myself moving 
·"·'·" 
.:-·--- --
beyond the superficial to deeper 
matters. 

Books. 

Astronomy. Jim 
Jarmusch. Vapor Caves. I wanted to 
--
hear what he had to say about Henry 
Miller, and I wanted to discuss art, 
education, and how to make the per-
fect grilled cheese sandwich. 

Like 
others before him, Josh can't be lim-
ited to college-ruled paper, but I still 
made the attempt. 

Despite the 
insufficiency of my writing, and my 
fear of anyone attempting to rewrite 
me, the pages in my notebook are 
irreplaceable memories of a sur nmer 
on the open road. Plus, my gauge 
reads 116,000.
