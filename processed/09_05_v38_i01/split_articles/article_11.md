"DO NOT THINK, THAT I AM COME TO SEND PEACE ON EARTH: I CAME NOT TO SEND PEACE, BUT A SWORD." ---Matthew 10:36

This citation is incorrect. The line actually comes from Matthew 10:34. But for the authors of a biting exchange of messages (the scrawled retort: "Christianity is evil and violent") on a marble wall dividing the third and fourth stalls in one of Yale's largest restrooms, that made little difference. When I first noticed the Matthew exchange, the second writer had the last word. But when I returned several weeks later, another artist had added: "No Christian has ever flown a plane into a building." One conclusion gave the debate a poetic flair, "Your breath smells so mean, you need Listerine/ Not a sip, not a swallow, but the whole damn bottle."

Around the corner from Machine City in Cross Campus Library, the restroom is long and wide, with a few yards separating a row of urinals from a line of twelve toilet stalls. From the outside of the stalls almost no graffiti is visible, but inside, it cannot be ignored. Some of it is carved into the stone inscriptions dating back to the seventies are still visible--and others written with Sharpie markers and ballpoint pens appear to have suffered little wear over the years. Most of the graffiti in the stalls arcs around a reader seated on a toilet, and the industrious bathroom user performs two simultaneous tasks.

A forum for political debate, young man humor, and a blank slate for personal ads, the bathroom stalls are primarily a message board, not unlike Craigslist. That is, more numerous than any other types of posting are raunchy solicitations for sex, often with time, place, and sometimes, a racial qualifier. Writers tempt readers to join them beyond the bathroom doors at Woolsey Hall or East Rock Park for anal and oral sex; specific requests are made for younger boys, Yale students, large genitalia, and, in one entry dated December 12, 1989, "real love."

Many of the more recent sexual requests are repeated by their authors in several stalls, and are often accompanied by e-mail addresses set up specifically for the occasion, with monikers derived from the author's physical characteristics and the year of writing. Only a few, including one describing himself, the writer, as a "closeted masculine athlete guy," admit any sexual repression. And while it's unclear whether a restroom pleading does result in rendezvous, no evidence exists to the contrary. The following poem, however crude, suggests that, perhaps, encounters do occur:

Here I sit
Thinking I was alone ...
While the gays in the next
stall moan.

Some writers receive responses demanding more details, but most often, requests are greeted with homophobic slurs and derogatory epithets. In fact, hateful words proliferate: There are a few swastikas, and on one wall, a number of phrases in German have been scratched out, leaving only "Ein Fuhrer."

Fortunately, the community of water-closet writers polices itself: Next to the anti-semitic graffiti is written an equally nasty response to the perpetrators. Most of the stalls are privy to hateful and largely witless denunciations of George W. Bush; and I found claims that our sitting president ingested cocaine, defecated, masturbated, and "knocked on the coffin."

Among these displays of rancor, loneliness, and unfulfilled desire, there is a scattered collection of the absurd, the inspired, and the inexplicable. Some inscriptions are authoritative ("The world is God's gargantuan testicle"); some are spiritual ("The balance: Why wait, grab your life/ Seek the middle path,"). There is a two-line excerpt from Robert Lowell's "Skunk Hour," a few declarations of love, one declaration of freedom, a discussion about the income of Yale staff, and an appeal to an indefinite subject to "Lock your mama up and throw away the key." Though perhaps the product of boredom, many of the inscriptions seem to be manifestations of the tensions inherent in the developing personalities of young adults and in the frustrated lives of employees. Where no one is looking, where no vandal can be
