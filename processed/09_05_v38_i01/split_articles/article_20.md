Orthodox Jews." Considering the 
omnipresence of the issue for 
Orthodox Jews at Yale, Rabbi 
Shlomo Shulman, another Yale 
graduate 
as well as rabbi, parent, 
and 
leader of 
Yale's Jewish 
' Awareness America Maimonides

has his own opinion: "I 
certainly . believe 
that 
as 
an 
American and a Yale alumnus that 
the Yale Five decision was unjust . 
and not consistent with the liber-
al, anti-discrimination platform of 
the University." 
Last year, two Harvard gradu-
ates 
published . a 
pamphlet 
addressing the moral residue the 
Yale Five case left on the academ-
ic world. The premise of the pam-
phlet, 
"A 
Parents 
Guide 
to 
en z 
Orthodox 
Assimilation 
on 
. 
University Campuses," stresses 
that if parents want their · kids to 
maintain a high level of religiosity, 
then they shouldn't turn to vaunt-
ed Ivy League schools · as the edu-
cational paradigm. But Rabbi 
Shulman, who graduated from the 
University in 1989, is an_ anomaly; 
he became Orthodox during his 
four years in New Haven. He sug-
gests that the Yale Five decision 
turned away Orthodox students 
because some people were eager 
to interpret Yale's position, per-
haps incorrectly, as a rejection 
of God. 
The compounded effect of this 
relatively short history and the 
"Yale Fiv~" incident is apparent in 
the dem<;>graphic of the communi-
ty today. Though estimates are

that about one-quarter, to · one-
third 
of 
undergraduates · are 
Jewish, within that group, the 
University's Orthodox community 
is tiny. Compared to the extensive 
networks of Orthodox students · 
that Ivy League schools like 
Columbia 
University 
Pennsylvania have been able to 
attract, largely due to New York 
Philadelphia's 
vibrant 
Orthodox communities, very . few 
Orthodox students matriculate at 
Yale each year. The ·reasons for 
this discrepancy are both.structural 
self-perpetuating. Orthodox 
Jews who do select Yale are inher-
ently making a statement and tak-
ing a risk. At Yeshiva University, 
a Jewish college that many kids 
who are products of Orthodox 
upbringings choose to attend, the 
customs that these students had 
been taught all their lives are rein-
forced; at Yale, students must 
elect to follow the customs at all, 
and even then, reinforcing them is 
very difficult. Elsewhere, the sac-
rifices made by Orthodox stu-
dents like Josh, Sarah and Zvika 
are commonplace. At Yale, it con-
tributes 
their 
sense 
in di vi duality. 
Still, it is hard for the trio to 
· ignore that their O..rthodox friends 
at Penn and Columbia are having 
very different, less exacting social 
experiences at college. At Yale, 
practical issues stand in the way of .. 
daily devotion. "At Columbia they 
have ten different services a day," 
says Zvika. "At Yale, we have a 
mere three: a pragmatic example 
of why it is easier to be observant

in a large community." And on a 
good day, the Yale Orthodox 
minyans 
prayer services 
usually 
attract just over the requisite min-
imum 
quorum 
ten 
men. 
Consistently following the Jewish 
tenets specified in the Torah and 
Halacha, the book of Jewish law, 
becomes much simpler when a 
group of 500 people, rather than a 
fistful, make collective lifestyle 
choices. At Yale Orthodox Jews 
are forced to perform rituals in a 
context that makes them seem 
unusual. Here, at one of the most 
enlightened places in the world, 
· some people just don't get it. 
For Sarah Raymond, this was 
iniFially frustrating. Last year, as a 
freshman, she struggled to recon-
cile who she· was ' as a religious 
woman with who she would be as 
Yale woman. And she had a lot of 
-::..-· 
choice( -":~The Jewish community 
here, especially the Orthodox 
community, is very different. At 
other schools people may find the 
community to be oppressive and 
issues become polarized," she 
explains. When things are polar-
ized, the choices are clear cut, 
making it easier to be religious 
and rely on the community. But 
Yale's Orthodox Jews _are a grab 
bag, a microcosm of the national 
community of Orthodox Jews: 
Some like the festivity of the Chai 
Society, others the warmth of 
Slifka. To some Orthodox Jews, 
this diversity is contradictory to 
their sectarian beliefs. 
But the 
model seems to work at Yale, 
largely due to the diffuse nature 
of the Jewish community on cam-
pus in general. 
One symbol of this diversity is 
the Joseph Slifka Center for 
Jewish Life at Yale. Home to the 
student group Yal_e Hillel, the cen-
ter serves both Jews and non-
Jews. This vision of Slifka as a 
multi-cultural institution is prob-
September 2005 
lematic for some Orthodox Jews 
who feel that at Yale, Sli.fka is all 
they've got and that it should exist 
to meet their demands. As a cul-
tural and not always traditionally 
religious institution, Slifka Center 
with expectations about the com-
munity, and an uncompromising 
mindset on issues like gender, has 
caused the community to become 
more conservative 1n tts practices.

is thus a place where all Jews are 
welcome, but where some may 
feel out of place. 
"By nature, the Orthodox com-
munity tends to be overpowering 
because they have so many needs," 
Zvika admits. But he knows that 
being at Yale precludes the possibil-
ity of an exclusively Orthodox facil-
ity. Yale's small Ortliodox popula-
tion cannot command the space or 
the attention that they might at 
other schools. And as the court 
decision stipulated 
they chose this 
life . .. "The kind of people who can 
stay religious at Yale are the kind of 
people who -thrive on challenges, 
who like obstacles," remarks Zvika. 
Not all of those obstacles 
come from outside the Jewish 
or 
even the Orthodox 
community. 
Some students believe that an 
influx of Orthodox undergradu-
ate males admitted between 2001 
and 2003, men who came to Yale 
in ·2002, Rabbi Jason Rappaport, 
may have similarly impacted the 
community. Some undergraduates 
who pray and study with Rabbi 
Rappaport have characterized him 
as "right-wing" on issues such as' 
the participation of women in the, 
mitryan, even on high holidays such' 
as Yom Kippur, which demands 
25 hours of davaning, or prayer. 
The friction over these issues 
is indicative of a larger conflict 
within 
Orthodox Judaism, 
in 
which no mainstream rabbis have ' 
endorsed the larger role 
for 
women in services that more left-
leaning students are demanding. 
Some more liberal-minded gradu-
ate students have stopped attend-
ing the Orthodox services as a 
result of Rabbi Rappaport's atti-
tude. One graduate student sup-
posedly went so far as to call 
Rabbi 
Rappaport "dishonest." 
Another student, however, dis-

Rappaport as ccstudents who are 
frustrated with Orthodox Judaism 
in general and are simply throwing 
stones at Yale's rabbinic figure." 
The debate has fomented largely 
beneath the surface, but its effects 
are definitely felt. 
Among the Orthodox Jews, 
Sarah acknowledges, "Being a 
woman and being Orthodox. is an 
issue on everyone's mind." 
Her 
comment is indicative of a certain 
degree of con1placency in the 
Orthodox community when it 
comes to women, especially the 
place of a woman in an Orthodox 
minyan. In general, at Yale, Sarah is 
not allowed 
to lead services, 
though outside of her religious 
life, the school encourages her to 
30 
er o 
speak her mind. 
"Gender is always a lively dis-
cussion at our Sunday night pizza 
and learning," Josh says diplomat-
ically, of the weekly forum he 
helps organize for the graduate 
undergraduate . Orthodox 
community. One step in the right 
direction is the New Minyan, a 
prayer service Sarah has some-
times chosen to attend because it 
perm1ts women to lead sections . 
But the service is not a staple on 
campus 
like 
the 
standard 
Orthodox minyan. Sarah observes 
that the New Minyan has faced 
some resistance: "We have had a 
problem getting a requisite ten 
men. If Orthodox men don't feel 
comfortable, they could actively 
recruit any Jewish men. I haven't 
voiced this suggestion to anyone, 
and I most definitely should have 
done so and have the opportunity 
to do so." 
Sarah's peers encounter daily 
tension between modern life and 
traditional religious values. This is 
something that Zvika, · Josh and 
Sarah have learned by 
b~ing 
S homer S habbos, following the tra-
ditional laws for the strict obser-
vance of the Sabbath. While none 
of them write, drive, carry money 
or keys, use . their cell phones or 
check their e-mail between sun-
down on Friday and sundown on 
Saturday, the three students make 
... 
sz on 
individual choices about what 
S homer S habbos means in a college 
context. 
, 
These choices became more 
significant for all of them at Yale 
given the school's weekend-domi-
nated social scene. Suddenly, the
