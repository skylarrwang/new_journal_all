I don't want to 
work for The New 
Journal! 1 have better 
things to do with my 
time than work for a 
magazine that has 
received every major 
writing prize at Yale 
as well as the Rolling 
Stone College 
Journalism Award. 
Besides, you and I both 
know that The New 
Journal is just a training 
ground formedia types 
like TNJ founder, and

Well, while we won't be seeing him at any TNJ meetings, we would 
love to see you! The New Journal is looking for innovative writers, DTP demigods, 
cutting-edge designers, dynamic photographers, artistes extraordinaires, business 
tycoons, and interested, interesting Yalies in general. If one of the above applies to 
you, come to one of our two snappy organizational meetings or call us.
