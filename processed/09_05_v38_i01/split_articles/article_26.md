s my friend and I turned the corner of 42nd and Vanderbilt, 
she knit her brows with concern. "I heard that these guys 
were thrown out for wearing sneakers." 
I snapped my gum. "No way." 
She nodded solemnly. ''I swear ... did you look at the website?" 
The website for the Yale Club of New York devotes an entire sec-
• 
tion to the dress code. ''Inappropriate attire;' my friend parroted to me, 
"includes, but is not limited to, denim, shores, t -shirts, sandals ... " 
I swailowed my gum and assessed my post-work get-up, which 
was indisputably ''business casual," but had 
melted onto my back during the sweltering 
subway ride to Grand Central. I felt like a 
limp piece of steamed broccoli. 

I had expected more fanfare. According 
to the website, the building boasts "22 
floors of home away from home"-a fact 
that I confirmed by joy-riding the elevator. 
Hidden within its unassuming exterior are 
three top:-tier restaurants, a full gymnasium 
with squash courts, a stocked library, and 
several bedrooms that members can utilize 
as they see fit. 

Typically, membership is limited to due-
. paying Yale alumni, graduate students, and faculty. In June and July 
however, this stipulation· is lifted on Thursday evenings for a spe-
cial happy hour during which all Yale alumni are invited to enjoy 
snacks (free), alcoholic beverages (not free), and the enlightened 
company of their fellow Eli's (invaluable?). In addition to business-
men hoping to network and former art majors prowling for free 
food, the event attracts a large, fake ill-toting undergraduate pop-
ulation.

Besides the navy flag, the club's entrance was marked by a group 
of yuppies 
outside~ chain-smoking and hissing into their cell 
phones. I pulled out my Yale ID and waited. 
The doorman, however, paid me no notice, and the receptionist 
barely glanced up when we entered. I shoved my ID back int~ my 
wallet. ''I can't believe they don't check," I murmured to my friend. 
She raised her eyebrows. ''Disappointed?" 

The lobby, on the other hand, met my vision of elitist exclusivity; 
the mahogany decor, plush carpeting, and austere portraits all 
matched the style I'd come to associate with Ivy League traditional-
ism. A grandfather clock ticked menacingly by the coat check, and 
two men seated in overstuffed arm chairs stroked their beards. 

We followed a noisy group of freshmen to the third floor. I .ike 
the foyer, the furnishings were dark wood. Chandeliers swung from 
the vaulted ceiling, and old photographs and dimly-lit sconces decked 
the walls. The ambience of the gigantic room was only disrupted by 
the crowds of raucous drinkers. The resulting mood was a cross 
between a speakeasy and an upscale ski lodge; I half expected to see 
Al Capone saunter in wearing a pink parka. 

As we wriggled to the bar, I bumped into Pete, a senior who told 
46 
me where to buy a drink ticket. His voice was barely audible amidst 
the clatter of huge gilded cups of beer banging against the tables. 
After procuring an overpriced glass of merlot, I scanned the crowd 
for classmates interning in New York for the summer. There were a 
few familiar faces, but the scene was dominated by graduates. In a city 
renowned for its diverse fashion sensibility, the look of the Yale Club 
was surprisingly square. As I navigated the room, I couldn't help but 
feel as though I was drowning in a sea of polo shirts, pearls, and pastel 
. Before sitting down, we made a pit stop for food. Again, my hopes 
were squashed; instead of fancy hors d'oeu-
vres, there were punch bowls brimming 
with Ruffles. A waiter waltzed by me, 
squeezing ranch dressing into plastic cups 
and spooning salsa out of a jar. 
''It's like a cheap bar mitzvah;' I whis-
pered.· 
"Hey, they're serving chili out of the 
same things they'- use in the dining halls!" 
She gestured towards hot, trays mounted 
over flames like pedestals - monuments to 
-
canned beans and Spam. As we sat down, 
_ I eyed two bins resembling the containers 
used to store jungle juice. A sign that read 
"decaf" was taped to one of them, assuaging 
my fears that I'd stumbled into a frat party. 

While drinking and nibbling on wings, our table assessed the 
crowd. Bald spots and canes notwithstanding, most of the graduates 
could pass for current students. Phrases like "post-colonialism," ''lit-
igate," and "keg stand" exploded across the room like fireworks. I 
pointed out a table of lookalikes wearing identical Yale ties. 
Nat, a junior, smirked and stroked his buzz cut "This is one of 
the creepiest scenes you'll find;' he said. 
"That's kind of pessimistiC:' argued Alice, also a junior. ''I mean, 
there's something to be said for the tradition. It's fun to see Yale 
friends in the city 
like a home away from home." 

Despite the deflation of my shi-shi expectations and my distaste 
for blue-blooded homogeneity 
an admittedly hypocritical combi-
nations of biases 
I found myself agreeing with Alice. After spend-
ing the summer in a city bursting with strangers, attending happy 
hour did make me feel as though I was a part of something. 

My thoughts wete interrupted by a heavy ~lash on my shoulder. 
I turned and saw an huge blond man trudging by with an overflow-
ing Mary's cup. 
"Sorry," he said sheepishly. 
I smiled and shrugged. like Yale, happy hour is a crossroads 
between Ivy League tradition and Animal House antics. To be a part · 
of it means accepting the occasional waterfall of cheap beer.
