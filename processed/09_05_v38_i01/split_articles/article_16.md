In his biweekly Yale Daily News column "Unchained Reactionary," Keith Urbahn claimed that the Bush-Cheney t-shirt he donned the week before last fall's election uncovered a "covert fraternity of Bush supporters on campus"—a substantial number of fellow Republicans who may not have had t-shirts of their own, but did offer thumbs up and looks of approval for his. His conclusion was that his political peers were not hiding their political beliefs; they just didn't feel like brooking all the criticism they would face if they chose to advertise.


At a casual Greek eatery near Dupont Circle this July, Urbahn elaborated. At Yale, he said, the liberal atmosphere is intimidating for people who disagree with it: "You're constantly barraged. So you either don't say anything or you feel like you know what you're talking about enough to interact with people." Clearly, Urbahn prides himself on being in the latter category. But of course, not everyone hankers for debate.


"If you get to know me well enough," Priscilla Adams explained at a restaurant on the other side of Dupont, "You'll see I have conservative written all over my forehead." But Adams doesn't flaunt it, and she has reasons not to: "If you're going to be really vocal, you have to be willing to argue all the time... and I'm not a confrontational person." Instead, as a sophomore, she applied for a Pickering Fellowship, which put her on track to spend two years getting a Masters Degree in International Relations, courtesy of the federal government, then join the Foreign Service for another four. She's not sure about a future in politics, but obviously, for the time being, she is ahead of the pack on getting a toehold in government.


The distance between Urbahn and Adams represents the division in the conservative demographic at Yale. There are a few highly vocal conservatives (another Yalie interning in DC this summer estimated there are five and then proceeded to count them off on his fingers; Urbahn was number two) and a larger mass of quiet ones, people like Adams and Christiansen, likely to join the political fray, but only after they graduate. Even Andrew Bender, the Vice President of the Yale College Republicans and a summer intern at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, recalls being unsure whether to mention his role in YCR in postcards to his freshmen counselees: He didn't want to compromise their goodwill before he even met them.


The silence of the latter variety of conservatives shrouds the University's Republican minority in ambiguity. There is little doubt that it's there, but its members can be difficult to identify, and easy for the liberal majority to ignore.


Coming to Washington, then, where most organizations carry a political designation by reputation, if not on the door, can bring Yale's political demographics into sharper relief. For Austin Broussard, who interned at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) last year and this summer for his Republican senator David Bitter, the experience was revealing: "It's not like we conservatives run in the same circles at Yale, so it's almost like a coming-out party: It's like wow, you too? I didn't even know!"


But in the world of DC interns, conservative Yalies aren't so few and far between. Last summer, when Broussard worked at AEI—home to administration luminaries like Lynn Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz and John Bolton '67, LAW '70—seven of the 55 summer interns were from Yale. This year there were another five. The Heritage Institute, a conservative think tank noted for its stellar internship program, had two Yalies this summer and three the previous year. Three of this summer's White House interns were from Yale.


But those numbers need context: A lot of Yale students intern in DC. When R. David Edelman set up a Yale-in-Washington program for summer interns last spring, 450 students registered for the mailing list. Of those, 300 attended Yale-in-Washington events between the start of June and mid-August, many with noted Washington conservatives like Weekly Standard publisher William Kristol and Senator John McCain. Edelman did not record participants' places of employment, but he agreed with many interns' estimates that at least half of the Yalies in DC were right-of-center.


At Yale itself, the proportions are much more skewed. Judging by membership in the Yale Democrats and the Yale College Republicans, Democrats outnumber Republicans at Yale by almost three to one. Of course, not all conservatives identify as Republican, nor all Republicans as all-around conservatives, but the numbers are telling. Conservatives constitute a much higher proportion of Yale students interning in DC than they do in the undergraduate population as a whole.


For a minority accustomed to dissimulating at school, DC is like a summer-long coming-out party.


**The New Radicals**

Even in William Buckley's era, at the start of the 1950s, conservatives were a minority, more prone than liberals to cause offense and less likely to receive slack for it. In God and Man at Yale, the former YDN chairman complained that his right-of-center editorials elicited far more ire than those of his leftist successor in the class of 1951. For Buckley, the experience indicated a turning point in Yale history: "I am forced to conclude from my experience with the Yale Daily News through several years, and from other evidence also, that at least at this college level, the great transformation has actually taken place. The conservatives, as a minority, are the new radicals."


At the time, conservatives of Buckley's political ilk really were radicals, fitful in their relationship even to the Republican Party. Today, conservatives occupy far less of a political fringe. Still, many of them count their status as radicals among the University's blessings. That's because they hail disproportionately from places where, as Adams said of her hometown in the Florida panhandle, "You're hard-pressed to find a Democrat" (though probably not as hard-pressed as Jordan Stevens, a sophomore from Midland, Texas who interned on Capitol Hill this summer. In the president's hometown, Stevens says, "Nobody I know, literally nobody, is liberal."). At Yale, by contrast, conservative-minded students encounter frequent opposition to the views they grew up with. Many say the contention forces them to re-trench and learn how to argue for their positions. Escape, after all, would be impossible. "If I weren't open to hearing liberals, I'd be shunned," chuckled Matt Ciesielski, a conservative from small-town Indiana, and an AEI intern this summer.


All that contact with the liberal opposition keeps conservatives on their toes. By way of example: The Yale Democrats has over a thousand nominal members, about one hundred of whom participate in the group's meetings or events. In the Yale College Republicans, by contrast, over fifty of the 350 members are active: one in six, as opposed to one in ten Yale Democrats.


And at the Yale Political Union, as president Silas Kulkarni explained, "Though the left outnumbers the right by about two to one in membership, the attendance pattern is almost the exact inverse... People have tried very hard to get the left to show up in force, but so far that has proven very difficult." The Party of the Right (POR), the most conservative of the six YPU parties, consistently has the best attendance at YPU debates: On average, Kulkarni estimates, 20 to 25 POR members attend, compared to only five to ten members of the furthest left party.


The reason, Kulkarni believes, is that liberals prefer activism to politicking. In a sense, that is not surprising: The Yale Democrats and liberal YPU parties are only two options in a whole smorgasbord of left-leaning, single-issue groups and clubs. Conservatives have fewer places to go—as Ciesielski said, "If you're not involved with the Yale College Republicans or the YPU, you're kind of just out there as a conservative." But undergraduates on the right also have more cause to consider their politics and, to the extent that they opt for political involvement at Yale, not to take that involvement lightly. The result is that, proportionally, there are fewer armchair conservatives than liberals.


Of course, there are a few places at Yale where conservatives are no minority. When Stevens' football coach polled the team after the election last fall, seventy percent of the players said they voted for Bush. And Ali Jiwa, the president of the Yale College Republicans, noted, "Especially at election times, when we needed to rally, it was up to someone to call up the DKE guys"—DKE being, as Urbahn put it, home to "a lot of Cheney hats." Outside the President's old fraternity, however, there are few groups whose members would dare to show their colors.

Ironically, having fewer conservative organizations at Yale has its perks—conservative Yalies who do get involved in campus politics know where to find each other, whether they need help or are in a position to offer it. When David Barnes, a former president of the Party of the Right, joined the staff of the Heritage Institute last year, he advised several POR members still at Yale to apply for one of Heritage's vaunted summer internships. When they did, Barnes says he was in a good position to advocate. David White, another alumnus from the class of 2003, did the same thing for his former cohorts at The Politic, eventually picking Will Ritchie to intern with him in the speech-writing department at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) this summer.


There is nothing new about connections helping students to secure jobs and internships in Washington. But for conservatives, minority identification lends a degree of camaraderie that dime-a-dozen liberals would find hard to match.


Urbahn, the YDN columnist, got his job as an intern in speech-writing at the Department of Defense when he sent his resume to David White at HUD, who passed it along to fellow Yale alumni in the White House and the Department of Defense. Though Urbahn did not have a formal interview at the White House, those he spoke to in both places were Yalies. "You share stories," he recalled later in the summer. "One guy was a reporter for the YDN; he just identified with me." Chris Michel, the former YDN editor-in-chief now serving on Bush's
