got eight. Let's get started."

The New Haven branch celebrated its 25th anniversary four years ago, recalls Dick, a retired history teacher who graduated from Yale in 1952 and occasionally plays in its marching band. But before he can get too nostalgic, Christopher Anagnostakis, the instructor for the evening and the group's veteran, interjects: "There have been groups of people dancing since the late sixties. They were around years before we became a recognized branch, which was no simple task." According to Christopher, there must be at least two certified instructors in each branch, as well as a minimum number of members. "The certification comes straight from Edinburgh," he announces with pride.


The best way describe Scottish dancing is to describe what it is not. "Don't confuse it with highland dancing, which is much more focused on the individual," Dick warns, wagging a stubby and weathered finger. "And it's a lot more competitive, for the young and strong and athletic," he says with disdain.

"It's like a mix between ballet and the figures from square dancing," Jane adds. "People who have a background in ballet will pick it up pretty easily."

During official demonstrations, the members don traditional Scottish garb which most of them own- but Dick prefers to wear a kilt in class as well. "It allows me more freedom," he says, shunning his kilt from side to side. All except one member are wearing ghillies, the traditional Scottish dancing shoes which are low cut, wide-laced, and wrap around the ankle like ballet slippers.

The members face each other in two parallel lines, with men on one side and women on the other. They dance a sequence of formations, weaving in predetermined directions. Some dance in place while others move around them. Other times, couples circle each other or switch partners altogether. Sometimes the dancers flow into circles of four in the middle of which each person puts one hand in to form a pinwheel.

The movement is fluid and in time with the music. There is no set dance movement, per se, as the members traverse the steps some skip while others shuffle, some trot while others strut each infuses his or her own personality into the routine.

Christopher announces that tonight they will attempt a series he adapted from an English country dance. This causes some raised eyebrows, but he immediately begins to read the sequence from a directions sheet: allemande, ladies chain, birl, arch, slip step, cast, snake, promenade; the members nod their heads as they visualize the dance.

As Christopher adjusts the stereo, some bend their knees in anticipation, while others start hopping or marching in place. They jump right into the dance once the music begins, executing the first few steps without interruption. But then Jane gets lost during a reel and stands frozen between the two lines.

"You were already chained! You don't make another chain," snaps Christopher. Jane ponders the direction for a moment, then smiles and falls back into place. Christopher waves his hand in a circle over his head and restarts the music.

Later that night, as he watches the group practice from the side, he explains, "I like things to be meticulous, which is why I was pushing them hard tonight to stand straight in the rows and make the movements flawless."

He quickly turns his attention back to the group. "When I said stretch your body to meet her, I really meant stretch," he barks. "I'm doing what I can," one of the older members snips and then giggles. "Scottish dance is all about precision and syncopation," Christopher notes.


After a few more rehearsals, the group seems to have worked out the kinks and executes the dance seamlessly. The mood is lighter and Dick even breaks the circle at one point to twirl, eliciting a collective cheer. As the room heats up, one of the older ladies recklessly takes off her knit button-down sweater and throws her hands up in the air. At the end of the dance, Dick and Jane steal a quick kiss.

As the last person leaves, George packs away the stereo equipment and shuts the creaking wooden door to the ballroom.

At 55 years-old, George, who is class chair of the New Haven branch, is one of the youngest in the group. "You know, we really could use some new blood in this group. And it's really such a shame, us being so close to Yale and all, full of young kids. Oh well. We're all young at heart," he says without the least bit of sarcasm.
