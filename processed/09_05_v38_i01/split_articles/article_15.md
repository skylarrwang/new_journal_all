**Yale and the Conservative Paradox**
**Author:  Not specified**
**Page number(s): 14-15**

In coming to Yale, Brian
Christiansen knew he was
entering a social enclave
more liberal than any he had
ever experienced; that was
exactly why he chose it. The son of a
retired navy captain, Christiansen had
always lived on military bases-
including, years earlier, the US base in
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba
and his par-
ents had reinforced the conservative,
patriotic tendencies of the military
community. But when Christiansen
decided to go to West Point as a high
school senior, his parents urged him
to test new waters; he could always
return to the military life later. In the
meantime, choosing Yale over West
Point would
offer
a
different
perspective.
And it wouldn't take long.
One of Brian's freshman-year suit-
mates also identified himself as a
conservative, but they were the only
ones in their Old Campus dormitory.
"I remember we were sitting around
in a dorm room in Farnam one day,"
Christiansen recalled this summer,
three months after he graduated and a
month before returning to Yale
School of Management as a Silver
Scholar, "and someone said, 'Well, at
least we won't run into many
Republicans here!' John and I looked
at each other and we both kind of
slowly raised our hands."
The experience was a harbinger of
ideological divergence to come. From
the beginning, Christiansen was less
than thrilled with the quality of politi-
cal discussion at Yale
and with the
acrimony of many of his peers' Bush-
bashing. "So after 9/11, I kept my
views to myself and studied and pre-
pared for my post-Yale career," he
recalled ruefully, but with characteristic
good cheer.
In hindsight, Christiansen posits
that the quality of political dialogue at
Yale has decreased since the time
when future members of America's
conservative vanguard
people like
Governor George Pataki '67 or
President Reagan's attorney general,
Edwin Meese III '53
studied there.
But criticism of Yale's leftist skew and
the resulting paucity of substantive
debate was nothing new in that era
either. In fact, the person most often
hailed as the father of modern
American conservatism, William F.
Buckley, graduated from Yale in the
class of 1950 and within a year, had
cut his teeth in national politics by
writing a book that denounced what
he saw as Yale's creeping liberal bias,
God and Man at Yale.
In the book, Buckley warned the
good Christian men dominant among
Yale alumni and trustees that, rather
than filling their ranks with more of
their own, Yale had taken to convert-
ing its students into "atheistic social-
ists." The book caused a furor in the
national media. Meanwhile, Buckley
went on to found the conservative
magazine The National Review and to
reign over traditional conservatives
for more than four decades. His career
captured a curious irony: Yale simultaneously bred the first public backlash
against left-wing dominance of col-
lege campuses, in the form of
Buckley's landmark critique, and peopled the vanguard of Republican pol-
itics. Today, Yale is the best-represent-
ed university among staffers in the
current Republican administration-
the second, in fewer than twenty years,
under a Yale Republican
and well
represented in a range of conservative
DC institutions. On the surface, it
seems Buckley was mistaken in con-
demning his alma mater. If what he
said was true, how could Yale have
continued attracting young conservatives, and propelling them into the
upper echelons of Republican politics
for another half century?
The question sheds light on the
