As both a Yale student and New Haven native, I know this town like the back of my hand. That said, it took me an entire year to notice the city's renovated street lights; and then, only after someone pointed them out to me.

With its new lights installed, the city shines not bigger or brighter but better, with the full cut-off light the directing the light downward instead of upward or out. The old style- the cobra head drop lights- relied on faulty logic. The theory went: The more light there is, the better you see.

Bob Crelin, a member of the Astronomical Society of New Haven (ASNH), has a different hypothesis, one that emphasizes brightness with contrast. He believes that the effectiveness of a fixture depends upon how the light it sheds is used, not how much of it there is. To see better at night, one should simply "lessen the contrast," as Crelin says, between light and dark. Dim the lights; your eyes will adjust. "It's a matter of letting your eyes do what they do naturally," he says.

Crelin, who authored *There Once Was a Star Full of Stars*, uses this example: Suppose you are in a pitch-black room with only a bare bulb to ward off the darkness. How well can you see? Not well. Now, suppose you shield the bulb with your hand. Much better. At night, on local streets, the new system's full cut-off fixture acts as your hand. It is a shield that not only clarifies your vision but also prevents stray rays from streaming into a bedroom window or producing glare on a car windshield.

The renovated system similarly battles light pollution the ultimate luminary evil- by protecting the sky from excess illumination. Overlighting, the primary cause of light pollution, is caused by basic fear of the dark. Anxiety over what lurks in the shadows provokes the copious amount of light. On its website, the International Dark Sky Association, an organization intent on combating light pollution, states that bright light is not equivalent to strong security. "The task is to be safe, not just to feel safe. We want to be able to see well, rather than lighting the criminal's way. Good lighting can be a help, poor lighting always compromises safety." Bob Carruthers, Vice President of the ASNH, states that the extra light meant to deter crime is, in fact, "counter-productive." "People do feel safer," he explains, "But in actuality they're not."

The battle of light versus dark is not a new one; and neither is the full cut-off solution. As early as 1997, Mayor John DeStefano, Jr. looked into revamping the city's light system but decided to maintain the status quo. "It wasn't popular back then," Crelin says, adding that full cut-off lighting now constitutes a hip alternative.

In 2004, the city reconsidered Crelin's project. New Haven's Street Lighting Manager, Tim Keyes, and its Purchasing Agent, Mike Fumiatti, took lead roles. Shortly after, the city hired two separate, private contractors to carry it out. In their entirety, the renovations cost New Haven close to $1.5 million $646,397.50 for the labor and $849,620.40 for the material. Star-lit skies don't come cheap.

Despite this investment, Brendan Cohen, a member of the student-group STARRY --Society for Telescopes and Astronomical Research and Recreation at Yale is not confident that the change in lighting provides city-dwellers with stronger star visibility. The group, which hosts observing sessions on Cross Campus, is fully aware of the diffusion that streetlights bring to the sky. "We're still in a city," he argues. "There's still gonna be light pollution." He cites this urban conundrum as the reason why STARRY makes little effort to combat over-lighting.

Stars or no stars, the new fixtures do require less power to function. Over time, the expensive project should pay for itself. Keyes cited consumption savings as equal to $220,000 each year. Crelin considers the renovation to be "a well-intentioned step in the right direction," but believes that New Haven would have benefited from more extensive research. He contends that with an even greater decrease in wattage, the city could have further reduced operating costs and saved a larger amount of money. But that's for the next round of bulbs.

With a full understanding of the project, I decided to test its environmental promise. Once darkness settled, I looked outside my window to the street light directly across from my house. Sure enough, its light aimed straight down. I reversed my gaze and looked up with a hope to see stars. No such luck that night there were only clouds.
