ad Cotton Mather, presi-
dent of a school called 
Collegiate, had the fore-
sight in 1718 to hire a brand 
management 
professional, 
doubtless "Yale" would have 
been cut from the list of edgy 
names for America's next great 
university. While these days 
ascendant universities pay high-
earning professionals to revamp 
their names and images, Mather 
kept it 
simple. 
Elihu 
Yale 
. 
. . 
donated · 560 sterling pounds 
worth of . books: although his 
own experience had more to do 
with 
colonial administration 
than academia, Yale's name was 
emblazoned onto American aca,... 
demic history. 

Given this haphazard start, 
Yale has built up substantial 
brand equity over the years, 
rounding off a basic liberal arts . 
education with sister schools of 
forestry, 
law, medicine, and 
business. To its students, Yale 
University is a mark 'of distinc-
tion forever headlining their 
resumes. To the University's 
Vice President and Secretary 
and 
the 
University 
Licensing 
Department, 
name is a trademark to be 
guarded from "misrepresenta-
36 
tion to the public." 

Yet despite Linda I<och 
Lorimer's tireless watch, Yale's 
image has a few hidden dimen-
sions. In fact, the three "yale" 
en tries in the Oxford English 
Dictionary have little to do with 
ivory 
towers 
academic 
excellence. With almost 2000 
years of use . behind it, errant 
meanings and associations can 
slip between the phonemes of 
even the most stalwart name. 

Like the rich, eccentric uncle 
who avoids family reunions and 
forgets to send birthday checks, 
the Yale student body has gen-
erally 
ignored 
its 
nominal 
cousins, perhaps to its own loss. 

These eccentric allusions may 
chip away at Yale's jealously 
guarded brand purity, but just 
like Elihu, they are part of the 
Yale narrative. 

77: Pliny the Elder introduces a 
beast called the eale (Latin) to 
the ancient world in his Natural 
Histories. The "yale" (English 
translation) sized up to ele-
phants and hippopotami, but its 
defining feature was its horns, 
which swiveled forward in bat-
tle. Some scholars have identi-
fied Pliny's yale with the Indian 
water buffalo. 

1443: John, third son of Henry 
IV, 
becomes . the 
Earl 
of 
Kendal. He adopts the yale as 
his supporter: and as one of the 
Royal Beasts of England. The 
beast resembled an antelope, 
with the tail of a lion or goat, 
again 
horns 
that 
swiveled on their own. In 1443, 
the Earldom passed to John 
Beaufort, who kept the yale as a 
supporter. Now the creature 
was speckled with gold bezants 
the characteristic markings of 
Beaufort, and enhanced with a 
pair of sharp tusks. 

15th 
Century: 
In 
medieval 
Wales, the Yal, Jal, or Ial district 
was an upland region ringed b y 
hills. By the late 1400s, this 
area, together with an adjoining 
district, had betome the lord-
ship of Yale and Bromfield, in 
the county Denbigh. 
Welsh 
children 
usually 
took 
their 
fathers' given names as sur- ·· 
names; no one system dictated 
custom, however, and some 
took an estate or a district for a 
surname. In this way, the word
