King Tut, Busted 
LAsT FEBRUARY, NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC 
approached Michael Anderson, a 
museum curator at the Peabody, with a 
seemingly 
straightforward 
request: 
reconstruct the face of a long-dead 
organism based on data gathered from a 
CAT scan of its skull. The catch? 
Anderson was not given a hint as to 
whose skull it was and his results would 
be com 
to those of a French team 
performing an identical reconstruction. 
Since his previous work included recon-
structing · the 
famous 
faces 
of 
Australopithecus aforensis Lucy and a giant 
Luna Moth for an exhibit on Dr. 
Doolittle, he knew the skull could belong 
to just about an 
· 
Luckily, a pl} · · 
CAT scan indi-
cated that the skull was, in fact, human. 
And it revealed tell-tale signs of the 
skull's origins. It still had a smattering of 
soft tissue 
nasal cattilage and lip tis-
sue 
and desiccated skin attached to it, 
indicating that it was not a fossil, since 
only bone fossilizes. Evu1 more telling, 
the brain case was full of resin. Only one 
civilization extracted the brains of its 
4 
dead through their nostrils and poured 
molten plant goo into the ensuing empty 
space: Anderson had a mumn1y on 
his hands. 

Anderson's next step was to use the 
data from the CAT scan to determine the 
mummy's basic characteristics: its age, 
sex, and race. 
''When I first saw the skull, I looked 
at it, and from my limited knowledge of 
skull morphology it looked like a female;' 
Anderson said. He based his assessment 
on the skull's .. soft brow ridges 
most 
males have prominent brow ridges-and 
its delicate facial features. 
''I knew I coulddt rely on my own 
hunches to do this reconstruction," 
· Anderson said. So he took the data to a 
series of experts around New Haven-
first to 
Aronsen at Yale's anthropol-
ogy department, then to an expert at 
Quinnipiac who had previously per-
formed scans on the Peabody's own 
mununy. 
Aronsen 
agreed 
with 
Anderson's initial assessment of the 
mummy's sex, but declined to speculate 
on its age or race. The expert at 
Quinnipiac ventured that the mummy 
· was in its early tw-enties, but was not able 
to definitively ascertain its race or sex. 
By now it was April, and Anderson did 
not feel comfortable going ahead with 
the reconstruction when he did not even 
know this pre · · 
information. ''I 
went back to National Geographic and I 
said 'Look, I think this is a female; I think 
it's someone in their early tw-enties; I 
don't know what race it is. I can do the 
reconstruction with this information, but 
if anyone puts a microphone in my face, 
I'm going to say I did it by the seat of 
mypants,"' he said. 

National Geographic put Anderson in 
touch with Susan Anton at NYU, who 
was able to insert the skull's precise meas-

urements into a computer program and 
produce a profile of the mummy. The 
results were not what Anderson had 
expected. According to Anton, the skull 
belonged to an 18-20 year-old male. 
'That was a real stunner;' Anderson 
said. But Anton's report revealed why 
Anderson, as well as two experts in the 
field, had been stymied by the mummy's 
sex. The mumn1y came from an 
extremely gracile population and was 
quite young, which meant that his facial 
features would have been more delicate 
than the average tnale. Also, his skull had 
been deliberately deformed, molded into 
a precise shape during the mummy's early 
childhood 
flat on top, bulbous in the 
back which would have decreased the 
prominence of the brow ridge. 

The moment Anderson found out the 
skull belonged to a male mummy, flash-
ing lights went of£ ''They told me when 
I first took the job, 'This is a very famous 
person. You will know who it is, and 
every person in the country will too,"' 
he said. 

Because Anderson initia11y thought the 
skull belonged to a female, he guessed 
that he was being asked to reconstruct 
the face of Cleopatra or Nefertiti. But 
that changed as soon as Anton con-
firmed that his project was male. There 
was only one truly famous male mummy: 
KingTut. 
''I was ahnost certain that it was Tut, 
but I was so hesitant to hazard a guess," 
Anderson said. ''It didn't matter to what 
I was doing." Now that the analytical 
work was out of the way, Anderson 
could 
· sculpting. 
''I started with sculpting the big chew-
ing muscles 
when you clench your 
teeth together you can feel them;' he 
said ''Then I produced the fat pads and 
the s · 
structures. Basically I built up 
the muscles, things that are going to 
affect the contours of the skin." 

After he perfected the facial struc-
tures, Anderson spent days detailing the 
sculpture's skin. He took molds of living 
people's faces, then put clay into the 
molds and grafted it to the sculpture's 
face in order to get a realistic texture in 
other words, King Tut may have the 
enlarged pores of some guy in account-
ing at the Peabody. Anderson presented 
his bust to N arional Geographic in May, 
and both he and the organization were 
extraordinarily pleased with his results. 
'~ou could draw a line down the 
French reconstruction and mine and put 
them together 
there's very little differ-
ence," he said. 

The French team~s reconstruction was 
featured on the cover of the June 2005 
issue of National Geographic and went on 
· display at the Natural History Museum 
of Los Angeles County the same month. 
Then, National Geographic encountered a 
publi<;: ,. relations 
snafu 
epic 
proporttons. 
"There were huge protests in Los 
Angeles about the color of his skin,---
they decided to yank the reconstruction;~ 
Anderson said. 

African-American activists in Los 
Angeles thought that the French 
team's reconstruction looked whiter 
than King Tut · should. Although 
Anderson did not initially have to 
make a choice about what skin tone he 
was going to use on his reconstruc-
tion 
National Geographic asked hirn to 
submit a plaster cast rather than a full 
color version in order to compare its 
features and bone structure to those 
on the French reconstruction; he has 
now been· commissioned to do two 
more busts of Tut as a result of the 
melee. One will feature a light 
Egyptian skin tone, and one will fea-
ture a dark skin tone, with the original 
French reconstruction serving as a 
mid-range model. 
"They're goin_g to put mine and the 
French team's (reconstructions) all up 
together and say 'This is the range of
September 2005 
skin color he might have had' and let 
the public make their decision," 
"To tell the truth, I don't quite get 
the protests," he continued. "It's a 
political hot potato, but the science is 
pretty clear about it and based on that 
science the skin color should have 
been such and such but we don't 
know what Caucasoids~ skin tone was 
when Tut lived. There are some very 
dark skinned portraits of Tut and 
there are some very light skinned ver-
sions 
so who knows." 

Despite uncertainties about the 
color of Tut's skin, Anderson and his 
French colleagues have likely put 
_ together the most accurate representa-
tion to date of what the boy king 
looked like when he died. And while 
the reconstructions of Tut will more 
likely inspire picketers than reveal 
unknown truths about the Egyptian 
royalty, there's something to be said 
for making one of Egypt's most 
famous pharaohs seem a little more 
human than he did when we only 
knew him from the gilded exterior of 
his sarcophocus. It's the beauty of 
finally putting a face to a name.
