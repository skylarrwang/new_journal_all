EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
• large red notebook lies in 
the backseat of my car, 
slotted between the week-
ly 
newspapers 
from 
Denver, Milwaukee, Fargo, and a 
milk crate stuffed with road maps, 
incense, ski-vests, and a cell phone 
charger. The dirty, tattered note-
book is filled with names and pic-
tures, celebrating each person I've 
met since I drove out of New 
Haven in May. I know now that my 
efforts were insufficient, but what 
else could I do to create tangible 
memories of a summer on the road? 
In 
the 
form 
of 
a 
Kinglsey 
Fellowship, Yale wrote me a check 
for $6000 to travel across the coun-
try, interact with a broad swath of 
Americans, and use my experiences 
to compose a play. The play has yet 
to be written, but the people I met 
are already becoming characters in 
my mind. 


One get-to-know-you conversa-
tion after another, proved that 
everyone in AmeriCa talks about the 
· same things; and I would offer simi-
lar pieces of information about my 
own life again and again, like a sit-
com reintroducing its characters on 
each episode. If asked about my ori-
gins, I'd say that I was from New 
Haven; I preferred not to discuss my 
childhood in Atlanta unless it served 
as a setting for a story or saved me 
from,. ''Oh, so you're a Yankee?" I 
wanted to inhabit the role of a per-
petual traveler, a curious and fun-
loving girl with only a car and a few 
colorful stories. 
Did I squeeze 
myself into a stereotype? I met a girl

named Mollie with the same story in 
Eugene, Oregon. 
I never saw her again, and prob-
ably never will; but she will be forev-
er summarized in my notebook as 
the traveler I met at the Oregon 
Country Fair. Ben from Seattle, on 
the other hand, deserves a more 
detailed description. By the time we 
had finished "rocking Portland," as 
he put it, we actually felt like we 
knew each other. 
Nonetheless, I 
have yet to muster the courage to 
write a full a·ccount of him. I doo-
dled 
his 
face 
slightly apelike, 
framed by brown dreadlocks 
and 
scribbled a few sentences about how 
we met, then left three blank sheets 
of paper and moved on to describe 
things I cared less about .. I came to 
realize that the people I grew to 
know best couldn't be confined to 
paper, could never exist again for 
me outside of our brief moments 
together. 


I generally

my 
path 
around 
Lake 
Michigan, through South Dakota 
and Wyoming, down, up, over, back 
down, up, and over. Llano, Texas. 
Rising Sun, Kentucky. Hannibal, 
Missouri. Keokuk, Iowa. Nederland, 
Colorado. Raymond, Minnesota. 
Small-town America exists. -Big-city 
America does too;. that's where I 
found the twenty-somethings living 
in 
under-furnished : apartments, 
working as cooks, and chain-smok-
ing hand-rolled cigarettes. 
But small towns: I still dream of 
one town that I saw time and time 
again. The library was the size of 
Mamoun's, and was only open from 
2:00 to 5:00 p.m. on Tuesdays and 
Thursdays. Main Street coincided 
with state highway 34 or maybe it 
was county highway E. The old-style 
gas station mini-mart served as the 
main grocery store, which really 
meant that it sold liquor, flour, and

granulated sugar. The hand-
painted wooden signs 
were peeling, and
