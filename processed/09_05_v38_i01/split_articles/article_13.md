·Bin~ry Systems 
"So 
CONNECilCUf IS A LOUSY 
place to do astronomy;' says Charles Bailyn, 
ar1: astrOnomy professor who has discov-
ered smaJ1 black holes in the Musca and 
Scorpius conste1lations, who first noted 
uniformity in the masses of black holes 
fanned by imploded stars, and who is cur-
rently observing binary star systems-all 
from 
his 
foothold 
in · Southern 
Connecticut. ''What you want, to get good 
observations, is mountains. In the desert" 
So once, maybe twice a year, the squir-
relly academic packs his bags for La Serer•a, 
Chile. Seven thousand feet. above the sea 
and two-hours from the nearest town, in 
the craggy, purple mountains of the Andes, 
just where the . lean dirt road

Bailyn is really just traveling from one Yale 
campus to another. Yale's ·Astronomy 
Department, working under the National 
Optical 
Astronomy 
Observatory 
(NOAO), contracts and hires Chilean tech-
nicians to maintain the Cerro Tololo Inter-
American Observatory here, and e-mail its 
images to the department 
When Bailyn arrives at twilight, he has 
the habit of counting the condors-those 
big, mousy awkward birds, who are grace-
ful only iri flight If they're flying this high, 
it is due to updrafts-bad news for observ-
ing. In La Serena, the local technicians have 
coined a phrase ''A three condor night,'' 
and it means the observations are going to 
be lousy. 
Yale astronomers get ten percent of 
the viewing time, while the other ·ninety 
percent is divided between the institutions 
which helped Yale to refurbish the scope. 
Because of a law which applies to all 
Chilean telescopes, Chilean astronomers 
get ten percent of all research time. 'The 
· only problem,'' Bailyn say8, "is that there 
just too few Chilean astronomers.'' Instead 
of letting the valuable re 
· · 
ten per-
cent go to waste, Yale's Astronomy 
Department agreed to help the University 
of Chile start up a graduate astronomy pro-
gram, even offering Chilean students class-
es in New Haven. Today, Professor Bailyn 
is the scope's director, delighting in all of its 
. .. 
successes. "A lot of people read about the 
new planet in the news this year;' he said, 
sp 
offhandedly about the discovery 
of 2003UB313, the supposed planet 
beyond Pluto, 
first found by the 
astronomers at Yale and Caltech. ''Really, 
their research was backed up by observa-
tions made on the telescope in Chile, run by 
Yalies." Graduate students swiveling in 
office chairs on Science Hill type e-mails to 
the astronomers in the Andes, and the next 
morning, receive digital images of swaths 
. 
of Southern Hermsphere. 
Ten years ago, Professor Bailyn traveled 
to Chile for three nights of valuable view-
ing time. On the first night, it rained. On the 
second night, the astronomers nearly fell 
off their swivel stools 
scared by the 
shrapnel-echo of "ping-pong-sized chunks 
of hail" pelting the hollow tin roo£ On the 
third night, they got lucky, and found evi-
dence of a black hole. 'The fun part of it 
was that we were able to examine the data 
as it was acquired,'' Bailyn said. "So we 
could see the star's motion around its invis-
ible companion while it was happening.'' 
This immediate joy is lost on most 
astronomers who today use a technique 
known as "queue observation" 
employ-
ing permanent on-site technicians and 
instructing them via the internet 
Though they're no longer harnpered by 
hailstorms-eve

is just pushed back in 
the event of inclement weather-many 
astronomers larnent the new efficiency. 
''We don't get as many cool trips,'' Bailyn 
jokes. And of course, it's less exciting to 
open a ]PEG the next morning than to 
catch an orbiting binary as it orbits. Jokes 
aside, queue observing is actnally a very 
serious controversy within the astronomi-
cal community. Many astronomers find it 
difficult to make informed judgments 
about the quality of the observations when 
-
they haven't seen them obtained. And, 
sadly, more and more students are graduat-
ing from astronomy programs without get-
ting their hands dirty with a real, 
huge telescope. 
Forty years ago, the telescope cratered 
in the Andean rock Was kept much closer 
to. those who ran it. Originally, Yale's 1.0 
meter scope (the mirror from which the 
sky's light is reflected has a 1.0 meter diam-
eter) scanned the Northern Hemisphere 
from cozy Bethany, Connecticut But, as 
Bailyn explained, 'Though there's excellent 
research that can be done from there, it was 
stupid." Due to · 
light pollution 
and poor weather, misty, humid Bethany 
just "didn't make sense." At that time, in the 
1960s, Yale was using time on larger tele-
scopes in other locales, which were able to 
see objects much further away. Other uni-
versities were throwing their 1.0 meter tele-
scopes away. 
In the face of this new technology, Yale 
opted to move Bethany's 1.0 meter tele-
scope in 1973 to an area of the sky they 
were interested in seeing more broadly. The 
Southern Hemisphere. 'The Southern 
Hemisphere is so much better than the 
6 
Northern Hemisphere; there's the closest 
- star, Alpha Centauri, and the 
Way 
stripes across," said Professor Bill van 
Altena, fr-om his office in the Northen1 
Hemisphere. "EVi 
of interest is 
down there.'' When the departinent moved 
its Bethany scope south, it was following a 
long tradition of research in the Southern 
Hemisphere, 
in 1920 when Yale 
started to develop its Johannesburg, South 
Africa station with a 26-inch refractor built 
in a Yale lab. In the 1960s, the department 
constructed a new observatory, the largest 
of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere, in 
the easten1 foothills of the Andes, at El 
Leoncito, 
tina. From 1965 to 1974, 
the department used this telescope to tack-
le the ambitious project of surveying the 
enti rc hanisphere. At the end of a ten year 
span, they had proof that these telescope 
were quite useful: They had produced the 
most exact photograph of the southern 
sky ever taken. 
Though the bulk of astronomical 
re; ~rch fits snugly within the stereotype of 
the bookish, de tical mathematician, Yale's 
Astronomy D 
ent puts their little 
to work all over the globe. Van 
Altena still goes south to train new workers 
and conduct his own resea reb several times 
, 
a year. Trips South have also become per-
sonal. ''My wife is Argentinean,'' he says; he 
September 2005 
met her on a sabbatical Professor 
Bailyn makes the trip less often, 
but cer1ainly looks forward to 
the travel. "It's fun to have an 
excuse to just 
oft:'' 
he said. '~d the students 
like it" To ensure that 
. Yale's 
grads do get 
hands-on 
experience, 
Bailyn founded a pro-
gram tided SMARTS 
(Small 
and 
Moderate 
Aperture 
Research 
Telescope System) which, 
among other 
forces grad 
students to ~ 
the observatory 
thanselves when the Andean workers 
. take vacations. In the program, students 
have observed 
Ray Bursters, mon-
itored black holes, and tracked asteroids. 
Today, the department is even looking to 
address the lack of study abroad programs 
for scia1ce majors by creating a summer 
..., ....... ::. .... un for undergrads who are interested 
in studying astronomy abroad, and speak-
ing entirely in Spanish .

Van Altena's teatn is currendy compar-
ing the map obtained 30 years ago using 
only 17 by 17 inch photo plates, which 
show the precise positions of the stars back 
then, with new digital exposures his team is 
of the same area of the sky. ·By 
' the two digital i.tnages, van 
Altena and his students will look at how, in 
the

stars in our

that will fiu d1er our knowledge about the 
mass and da1sity of our

existence of dark matter there. '~the 
initial census, where we counted the stars 
and added up their mass, there wasn't tnuch 
of a gap,'' van Altena says, referring to the 
observable tnass of the 
, versus the 
mass implied by the way it is moving; "We 
found no evidence fur dark maucr locally, 
near the sun in our own 
, though it 
may exist in other parts of the

and dark a1ergy-that invisible stuff that

"Before the advent of comput-
er-controlled large telescopes and 
instrumentation, observing meant 
being trapped in an observing cage, 
which is five feet in diameter and six 
feet long, high above the floor" van 
Altena described. "It's one of the 
most mystical experiences for an 
observer. You have the feeling of 
being able to see the distances 
between stars." In New Haven, 
where the sky at night glows dull 
orange, where the stars look like 
pinpricks, astronomers feel much 
further from the stars they study. 
Researchers say that El Leoncito, 
Argentina is so dark that when the 
moon is down but the Milky Way is 
up, you can read a newspaper by the 
lig~t of the stars. ''At least in my 
generatiori:," said van Altena, "we 
became astronomers because we 
loved to look at the sky, and really 
see it."
