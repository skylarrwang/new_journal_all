The conference will bring together a number of scholars from different 
disciplines, centering around the Jewish philosophical exegete, Philo. 
This conference will situate Philo in his geographical, philosophical, and 
ideological context, looking for affinities and precursors in other ancient 
texts. The conference will also examine Philo’s reception and influence, 
particularly among Jewish and Christian readers.
