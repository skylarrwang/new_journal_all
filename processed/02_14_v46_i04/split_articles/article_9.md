**Title: The Same Old Song**

When I walk into the large room jutting out of 
Tony DeLucia’s garage, I am momentarily lost in 
time. A metallic 1947 Wurlitzer jukebox stares 
at me from across the room. My eyes pick out 
a British Invasion pinball machine from the 
seventies, and a hefty silver-and-bronze See­
burg jukebox from the fifties. The jukebox 
plays songs like the Wurlitzer and The Crests’ 
doo-wop hit “Sixteen Candles,” and the pinball 
machine sits by the back wall beneath a wooden 
shelf displaying rainbow-colored records, and 
glass soda bottles. I’ve walked into another de­
cade, but I’m not quite sure which one. 

DeLucia strides over to me, his hands ca­
sually slipped into his pockets. “Do you mind 
if I write this down? I forgot a tape recorder,” I 
explain, and he laughs. “Sure. Why not? I guess 
you’ll just have to do it the old-fashioned way.” 
DeLucia opened his shop, Antique Amuse­
ment Services, in Hamden thirty-three years 
ago, so he knows “old-fashioned” better than 
anyone else. “I’ve been doing this part-time—all 
the time—since I was young,” he explains. In the 
last few decades, he has repaired everything 
from vintage soda machines to coin-slot arcade 
games for clients all around the Northeast. He 
has made a name for himself, literally—people 
call him “Tony the Jukebox Man.” “It just sort of 
stuck,” he says.   

Here in his workshop are the days of can­
dy parlors, soda fountains, and drive-in movie 
theaters. Black-and-white photos of smiling 
quartets in matching blazers and dresses cover 
the walls; I pick out Elvis but the rest are unfa­
miliar. I can imagine people coming to Antique 
Amusement Services, mesmerized by visions 
of apple-pie America. But as I turn back to De­
Lucia, I realize he must recognize my brand of 
nostalgia after seeing it time and time again, 
the obsession with the proof of the past, indul­
gences he has learned to treat with care.

DeLucia is the son of a mechanic, and he 
remembers learning to appreciate his father’s 
technical and artistic skill. After trade school, 
he repaired mainframe computers, carrying his 
father’s work into the modern era. Jukebox ma­
chines were his part-time focus for eight years 
until he left the computer industry to found an 
antiques company out of his home in Hamden.

These days, Tony spends much of each day 
working alone. He consults with his wife over 
business matters, but the rest of the time he 
disassembles, rewires, and repaints old ma­
chines. Each one has a motor and an amplifier, 
though the mechanics and designs often vary. 
Some need chrome plating while others re­
quire specific paint tones and gas pipes. It’s “old 
equipment, but new and different all the time,” 
he tells me.

During his busy six-day workweek, DeLucia 
visits customers in New Jersey, New York, Con­
necticut, and Massachusetts. “I’ll just about go 
anywhere,” he says, and his repaired machines 
have done their own traveling, starring along­
side Robert DeNiro and decorating the houses 
of Whitney Houston and Keith Richards. But, 
out of the 2,600 clients he works with, most are 
elderly couples and families. Some people show 
up every few months; others every few years, 
for tune-ups. DeLucia likes keeping his busi­
ness personal. 

“Individuals are always better than compa­
nies,” he tells me. “It’s easier to work with hu­
mans.” 

In the workshop, as I take in the time warp 
around us, DeLucia keeps his eyes fixed on me. 
He reminds me that repairing antiques is no 
game: “It’s a job. It’s an interesting job, but it 
has its headaches too.” Impossible restorations. 
Long trips to Manhattan and Massachusetts. 
Equipment that never arrives. 

DeLucia isn’t one to get swept up in memo­
ries, but he’s pleased when his customers share 
his enthusiasm for these clunky, colorful game 
boxes. It’s the newest generation that gives 
him the greatest pleasure, the ones who come 
in with family heirlooms in the trunk. He re­
members fixing a jukebox belonging to a cus­
tomer’s late grandfather, and dropping it off at 
the Manhattan apartment where the client had 
gathered the whole family to receive it. 

Over the course of a day, DeLucia some­
times tries out the machines in his workshop 
while on break. He will play a quick game of 
pinball, or play one of his favorite records on 
one of the jukeboxes. Then he gets back to his 
fixing and refixing, the music playing as he 
works. Though he walks me through the me­
chanics of various machines, the moments that 
stick with me are not the names of the parts 
and their mechanisms, but his own moments of 
reminiscence.

“It’s a very good feeling,” he tells me, “bring­
ing something back to life.”

**Title: Sharpened Points**
**Page number(s): 5-6**

A lot of mapmakers end up selling posters, Yale 
professor Bill Rankin tells me, but he wants his 
projects to be something more. He wants to rei­
magine the conventions of cartography, going 
beyond images you could hang for display or 
decoration. A Rankin map might be aestheti­
cally pleasing, but you can be sure it will also be 
intellectually challenging.

Rankin grew up in the orderly grid of Chi­
cago, where he always knew which way north 
was. When he moved to Philadelphia in 1999, 
he turned to mapping as a way of situating him­
self in his new environment. Mapmaking pro­
vided him a point of entry into the narrative of 
the city, a way of understanding both the plac­
es he frequented and those he didn’t. Moving 
to Boston for graduate school disoriented him 
again, and he learned to understand its winding 
roads and racial divisions by drawing them. In 
2003, Rankin created a depiction of the city’s 
subway system, highlighting the ways in which 
its connections and dead ends contributed to 
racial segregation by neighborhood. He decided 
to share his work. He considered hanging print­
outs of the map at stops, confusing travelers 
just enough to provoke questions about access. 
Ultimately, he built a website, radicalcartog­
raphy.net, which hosts this and his other proj­
ects. Sometimes, he uploads them to Wikipedia, 
where they often become the standard maps on 
their subjects.

“Radical Cartography wasn’t so much about 
making maps that were part of radical activism, 
but rather part of a radical new way of making 
maps,” Rankin said. He decides what’s visible 
and invisible, rather than deferring to the gov­
ernment, or to Google. “Often, mapping is done 
with a preconceived idea of what the relevant 
boundaries are,” he explained. “We assume that 
state boundaries are important, and so we map 
with those in mind.”

Rankin does not follow the common prac­
tices of the maps found in textbooks, which 
often shade in borders according to language, 
religion, or economic conditions, with a broad 
brush. He peels back the traditional base layers 
of maps to allow the data to show more complex 
patterns. Above all, he values detail. His dot 
maps display each individual data point rather 
than shaded averages—the more granular the 
data, the more descriptive the map. As a result, 
he is limited by the availability of good data; for 
instance, he has shied away from mapping obe­
sity because reliable statistics only exist at the 
state level. Still, he brings obscure information 
into the public light in sometimes whimsical 
ways. He recently mapped a web survey asking 
French citizens how many times they kissed 
in greeting, the results outlining unofficial re­
gions that emerge through custom. 

Since he moved to East Rock in 2011 to 
teach history of science at Yale, Rankin has 
again familiarized himself with a new city 
through his craft. In August 2012, Rankin cre­
ated two “heat maps” that showed the epicen­
ters of initiated and already-foreclosed homes 
in the city. Red blotches blossom in areas with 
moderate amounts of foreclosure, yellow areas 
have higher rates, and white designates the 
foreclosure hotspots of the city. 

Carla Weil, executive director of the Great­
er New Haven Community Loan Fund, who 
herself majored in geography at UCLA, appre­
ciates the logic behind Rankin’s maps. “I think 
of things in terms of maps,” she said. “I see the 
overlays of factors.” She points to two yellow 
hot spots on the map of initiated foreclosures, 
one in the Hill and one in Fair Haven. “These 
two crescents were surprising to me,” she said. 
By comparing the sizes of those hotspots to 
those on the map of completed foreclosures on 
Rankin’s maps, Weil found that almost none of 
the threatened foreclosures actually happened 
in the Hill, while in Fair Haven, most did.

Rankin was also surprised by the outcome 
of his project. “The narrative we hear in the 
national press is really about hard-hit middle 
class families, because there’s a clear kind of 
moral agony in there,” he said. “But the actual 
geography of foreclosure is that the places that 
are already struggling are the places that are 
hit the most.”

The maps have allowed the Weil and her 
colleagues to decide which areas most need 
their canvassers, and to correct imbalances in 
outreach and counseling services. They also 
helped the group secure funding. Hard num­
bers can only communicate so much, says Bri­
anna Gavigan, programs manager of the Great­
er New Haven Community Loan Fund. Rankin’s 
maps illustrate the impact of foreclosures with 
precision, locating them in familiar places. 

While not all of Rankin’s maps are motivat­
ed by issues as serious as foreclosure, they all 
result from his desire to better understand his 
world. When he wanted to know if an animal’s 
evolutionary development played a role in the 
ethics of eating the animal, he turned to map­
ping, creating “Eat the Animalia?” which now 
hangs outside his office. Using seafood ratings 
from the Monterey Bay Aquarium and typical 
farming conditions for poultry and livestock, 
he color-coded an evolutionary cladogram, 
or tree, and found new patterns. A formerly 
a strict vegetarian, Rankin was surprised to 
find that sardines were a far more sustainable 
source of protein than cage-farmed eggs. After
