School asked Walton to create an after-school 
nutrition education program for its students. 
She agreed instantly but quickly ran into a 
problem. The food supplied by Connecticut 
Food Bank, where she worked, was healthy but 
unappealing. 

Walton met with Anne Demchak, a board 
member of the Connecticut Food Bank who was 
then the manager of a Stop & Shop just outside 
of New Haven: “I said, ‘I don’t have the fresh 
fruits and vegetables I need, and she said, ‘Just 
come over to my store on Amity and take what­
ever you want.”

One spring morning, Demchak and Walton 
were walking through the Dwight neighbor­
hood when Demchak noticed the old Shaw’s 
lot. She stopped in front of the parking lot and 
asked the question Walton had asked herself, 
every time she drove to Dixwell or Amity to get 
her groceries: “Why did 
Stop & Shop not take this 
spot?” 

Less than two weeks 
later, when the regional 
manager of Stop & Shop 
happened to be doing a 
sweep of all the stores 
in the area, Demchak 
and Walton invited him 
to lunch. Soon after, the 
three of them stood in the parking lot of the old 
Shaw’s, looking out across the warm tarmac. 
Just a few miles from Yale, this neighborhood 
was in desperate need of a grocery store. At the 
time, Whalley was dotted with dollar stores and 
chicken shacks. 

“These guys at the corporate level hadn’t 
seen the site,” Walton said. “None of them re­
alized the unbelievable location. It’s not like”—
she scrounges to find an absurd example to tell 
me—“putting a Stop & Shop in Bridgeport. They 
hadn’t realized how close Yale was, how close 
the hospital was, how many thousands of work­
ers might shop there.” Walton’s Bridgeport ex­
ample shows how corporate supermarkets find 
the right location—by assessing the potential 
for profit, not the need for food.  Once the re­
gional manager approved the new store, nego­
tiations started within the week.

Stop & Shop came with a gas station and 
landscaping, but that wasn’t enough. It needed 
to be integrated into the neighborhood. During 
the summer of 2011, Walton hosted a nutrition 
program at every library branch in and around 
New Haven, supplying Stop & Shop clemen­
tines, granola bars, and two percent milk. Since 
Stop & Shop opened, it has been donating to lo­
cal distribution sites, including soup kitchens, 
and has given priority in hiring to Shaw’s for­
mer employees. 

But given the history of the lot where 
Shaw’s once stood, Stop & Shop’s presence can 
sometimes feel tenuous, and temporary. What’s 
stopping the supermarket from selling out 
when business goes sour? 

Across town, a different kind of community 
grocery store had already been taking root. It 
started in 2010, when Bruce Becker was busy 
working on his latest development, a mixed-
use thirty-two-story tower at 360 State Street. 
When Becker got from permission New Haven 
to build, however, the city 
added 
another 
condition: 
Becker had to find a grocery 
store to lease out the ground 
floor. 

In theory, the location by 
the train station was ideal. 
But taxes were projected to 
be 
unusually 
high—about 
$1.4 million for the build­
ing—and there wasn’t much 
room for a parking lot. Whole Foods and Trader 
Joe’s both turned down Becker’s offer, so he 
contacted Mark Regni, an organic foods re­
tailer who was working for Whole Foods at the 
time. 

Cooperatives are usually designed by a 
group of members who invest together to main­
tain bargaining power against vendors. They 
tend to be small, intimate, and community-gov­
erned. Elm City Market, on the other hand, was 
built from the top down; before it had members, 
it was completely designed by outside develop­
ers. Together, Beckers and Regni designed a 
plan for a hybrid co-op—a store that would sell 
both basic non-organic foods and higher-end 
natural foods. Regni then signed on as general 
manager. 

Once Becker identified the creation of a 
co-op as the solution to the lease requirements, 
he made plans for making the store attractive 
to downtown New Haven residents right away. 
In a glossy newsletter published each month, 
the developers detailed the construction pro­

cess. By February 2011, they were finalizing a 
logo for the market. By March, Becker and his 
team were focusing on how to optimize the ar­
chitecture to bring “visual rhythm and images 
of nature into the pageantry of buildings.” In 
April, they asked future members to hand-
write notes about their wishes for the store, 
which would be placed in the floorboards on 
the ground floor. By November, the market had 
finally opened its doors in the 360 State Street 
building. Yet it still faced a problem most co-ops 
never encounter: how to find a critical mass of 
members.

Two years later, near the entrance to Elm 
City Market, cases of Guinness stand next to a 
pile of plantains. Beside the checkout counters, 
Snickers and Hershey bars sit next to a sign for 
“Organic Decorative Gourds.” On the busy Sat­
urday when I visit, the market is bustling when 
a supervisor named Derek Faulkner finally 
wanders into the market, eating salad out of a 
cardboard to-go box. He has a rhinestone stud 
in each ear, and wears a blue polo shirt. The tat­
too on his arm reads, “Vive et vivas”—live that 
you may live.

Faulkner, a native of Branford, Connecticut, 
has been here since the market opened. “I didn’t 
even really know what a co-op was,” he says, 
spearing a cherry tomato. “My sister came and 
bugged everyone in my family, so we all became 
members.” Faulkner has since moved up from 
member to supervisor. First he was in charge of 
ordering most of the groceries, and now he  di­
rects the purchase of beer and bulk products—
things like oats, nuts, and dried fruits, which 
customers can buy in any quantity out of tubs 
that line the west wall of the market.

“Almonds are one of my top products since 
we opened,” Faulkner says, pointing towards 
the tubs. “That and oats and rice—white and 
brown rice.” The market also sells quite a few 
non-staple items in bulk, including dried man­
go strips, date rolls, and organic gummy bears.

“It’s easy for us to get a request and fulfill 
it,” Faulkner says. “Whenever I’m in the beer 
aisle and I chat with a customer and they want 
to switch out a brewery, it’s easy for me to do 
that without having to get approval.” He con­
trasts this policy with the larger chains like 
Stop & Shop, noting that he has the freedom

to rotate products and to see which ones sell: 
“There’s no middleman. Just the man.”

Assistant marketing manager Stephanie 
Berberich designs cooking classes and other 
educational events to get people interested in 
the market and thinking about how they eat. 
“Even if we were to hand out vegetables, they 
might not necessarily know what to do with 
them,” Berberich says.

Meanwhile, the market tries to reach low­
er-income shoppers. “We want everyone to feel 
welcome to shop here,” Faulkner told me. Elm 
City Market offers “fresh cards,” which entitles 
a SNAP-eligible card-holder to ten dollars of 
fresh produce. The market has also started a 
“basics” program, setting competitive prices on 
staple household items that are still organic and 
local. The top of the list looks like this: Puffins 
Cereal, 3.49. Baby carrots (16 oz), 2.79. Tropi­
cana Orange Juice, 4.49. For reference, a 16-oz 
bag of baby carrots at Stop 
& Shop is 1.69. For Elm 
City Market’s non-“basics” 
offerings, the price dif­
ference is even bigger; a 
loaf of whole-wheat bread 
might run you five dollars, 
compared to Stop & Shop’s 
1.99. Despite Elm City 
Market’s efforts, it’s hard 
to imagine how someone 
living on SNAP would choose to frequent a 
store where the “competitively priced” items fit 
on a single sheet of paper.

Not surprisingly, the community market 
is struggling to integrate into the New Haven 
landscape. Elm City Market is still in business; 
organic, local food clearly appeals to enough 
customers. But to a large subset of Elm City’s 
proclaimed target population, the pineapples 
and arugula facing the entrance of Elm City 
Market are simply inaccessible. It may be a 
community market, but the community it 
serves is not the one that needs it most.

I first met Tanya, who declined to give her last 
name, at the Community Soup Kitchen on a 
rainy November afternoon. Tanya has lived in 
New Haven for over a decade. She can list, with 
encyclopedic precision, the opening hours of 
every food pantry and soup kitchen within a 
half-mile radius of downtown New Haven. She 
eats her pulled-pork sandwich quickly. “I don’t 
eat at places like this all the time,” she says. 
“Just if I’m in the neighborhood.”

At the Community Soup Kitchen, a few late 
visitors sit at the red-checked tables, hunched 
over their food. One is a young woman wear­
ing tight sweatpants and a hoodie; another is a 
gaunt man wearing shorts and battered suede 
chaps. As these visitors disperse, they toss sty­
rofoam plates flecked with coleslaw and pork 
into a trashcan. 

New Haven has more soup kitchens and 
food pantries than most surrounding cities. The 
Community Soup Kitchen is situated roughly 
halfway between the two supermarkets and 
across the street from Gourmet Heaven on 
Broadway, a small market where the imported 
candies displayed next to the entrance might 
cost you over five bucks. 

Rick Durance, one of the assistant man­
agers, surveys the room. “We try to make the 
meals nutritious,” he says, 
opening a styrofoam con­
tainer to show me a typical 
serving. “Usually the salad 
is a little bit bigger.”

“We actually see a fair 
number 
of 
people 
com­
ing from out of town to use 
these resources,” the man­
ager, Dave O’Sullivan, tells 
me later. “New Haven is an 
attractive place to food-insecure people. Peo­
ple will come from as far as Wallingford,” a city 
twenty minutes away. 

Tanya, who is almost a year sober from crack 
cocaine and alcohol addiction, found solace in 
Community Soup Kitchen when she was first 
recovering. “If you give respect here, you get it,” 
she says, licking her fingers. She gestures at her 
outfit: striped green sweater, matching cordu­
roy pants, shiny green eye shadow. “A year ago, I 
was not like this.”

Tanya buys most of her food from grocery 
stores, usually with the help of food stamps. 
She used to receive $189 every month in ben­
efits, an amount that gets loaded onto an elec­
tronic benefits transfer (EBT) card and can be 
used like a debit card. After government cut­
backs in October 2013, she receives a little bit 
less. She can’t spend that money on pre-made 
food from, say, the burrito joint just down the 
street. It has to be groceries. Tanya fiercely 
guards her EBT card—not even relatives are
