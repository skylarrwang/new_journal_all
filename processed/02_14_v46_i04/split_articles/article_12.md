It was a typical Saturday night in New Haven: a 
long line of people snaked back alongside Toad’s 
Place on York Street. Cabfulls more got out at 
the curb every few minutes. Hordes of college 
students spilled onto the adjacent walkway 
that divides the venue from Mory’s, the private 
club next door, and leads back to two of Yale’s 
residential colleges.


Over the course of its nearly forty years in op­
eration, Toad’s has hosted its fair share of legend­
ary acts. In 1989, the Rolling Stones opened their 
longest tour ever with a surprise performance 
there. Its frequent concerts and dance parties 
have established the venue as a mainstay of New 
Haven nightlife. Yet many regulars I talked to 
that night, and since, haven’t heard about the on­
going legal battle that threatens to close it down.


Several doors of the Toad’s building open 
onto Yale property, including the walkway that 
borders Mory’s. For thirty years, the two enti­
ties had a standing legal agreement that gave 
Toad’s access to those exits. But in 2008, the 
university laid out new terms: exits could only 
be used in emergencies, and Yale could termi­
nate the agreement at will. Toad’s rejected that 
offer, largely on the grounds that the agree­
ment’s short duration rendered it useless. “In 
ten years, it’s over,” explained Jim Segaloff, who 
has not been representing the club in this par­
ticular suit but is Toad’s longtime lawyer. “Yale 
revokes it or terminates it, and then where are 
we?” But Yale press secretary Tom Conroy dis­
misses this argument, comparing it to a lessee 
who wants an infinite lease on a property.  He 
explains, “Think of all the businesses that have 
leases. Their lease is going to run out, they’re 
going to have to negotiate with their landlord, 
and their landlord might decide, ‘I have another 
use in mind for that property.’” 


The club has continued to use the disputed 
property on the basis of easement by implica­
tion, a legal term that indicates that a right 
can be established over time, even without an 
explicit agreement. Yale responded by filing an 
injunction against Toad’s in 2010. The case has 
been in limbo since Bill Gallagher, the attorney 
representing the club in the dispute, died in 
December. Segaloff said that the case would 
remain on hold for the time being while Galla­
gher’s colleagues grapple with their loss.   


In recent decades, Yale has brought in high-
profile businesses like J.Crew, Urban Outfitters, 
and Apple, through its commercial properties 
management division, University Properties. 
Despite its popularity among students, the 
club’s grittier aura seems out of place among 
the sleek upscale chains that line the neighbor­
ing avenue, Broadway. Toad’s campus market­
ing representative, Yale senior Arvind Mohan, 
contends that, “The lawsuit just seems like it’s 
more about politics than the actual door.” Yet 
Conroy insists that, in the Toad’s case, Yale’s ef­
fort to rebrand New Haven is “irrelevant, com­
pletely irrelevant.” 


In 2008, Yale engaged in a similar battle 
with local restaurant Bespoke. The restaurant’s 
back door opened onto a lot owned by Yale, and 
its owners fought to establish permanent free-
access rights to that space. While the issue was 
being resolved in court, Yale built a fence along 
the property line about one foot from Bespoke’s 
back wall, making it impossible to open the 
back door more than a sliver. The restaurant’s 
owners won their case, but they ultimately sold 
the restaurant and left New Haven, telling the 
Yale Daily News that the emotional and finan­
cial toll of the ordeal had been too much to bear. 


Meanwhile, Mory’s, which regularly hosts 
trivia nights and undergraduate a capella 
groups, also has several exits that open onto the 
contested walkway, yet it has negotiated with 
Yale without incident. Since 2010, there has 
been an agreement in place that permits their 
use of these exits. While it includes a yearly re­
newal process and a similar capacity to termi­
nate at will, these provisions have proven much 
less problematic than for the dance club next 
door. 


One night at Toad’s, I asked a group of stu­
dents what they thought of the ongoing prop­
erty dispute between the club and Yale. “The 
ongoing what?” they shouted back at me. For 
now, revelers continue to dance into the early 
morning hours, blissfully unaware that the 
court must eventually come down on one side 
of the street or the other.
