The beach shrinkage is compounded by 
the presence of humans—specifically, by the 
homes, hotels, and restaurants they build. Ac­
cording to Johnson, there used to be a line of 
dunes on the beach—piles of sand three to five 
feet high. Beach grass grew on top of the dunes 
and sent roots down deep, holding the sand in 
place. But when people started building on the 
beach in the late 1800s, they knocked down 
the dunes, and the beach grass had nowhere to 
grow. Now, the beach is not only flat, but also 
rapidly shrinking.


In 1891, seven cottages dotted the shoreline. 
Seven years later, the New Haven Street Rail­
way Company ran a trolley line from downtown 
to the beach. The ride cost a nickel and took 
about forty-five minutes. Hundreds flocked to 
the beach, building summer cottages and pa­
tronizing restaurants and hotels. A boardwalk 
stretched across Cosey Beach Avenue; there 
were pool halls and old-fashioned ice cream 
stands. Women relaxed on the beach in long 
white dresses, their husbands standing nearby 
in black suits and flat straw hats.  


Anne Hines’s grandfather purchased a 
squat cottage about a quarter-mile from the 
beach in 1910. Five years later, he outfitted it 
with a cellar, a second story, heating, and elec­
tricity. Hines was born in 1938, and she has 
lived in the same house ever since.  


As a child, she spent most of her summers 
there. She was on the beach by 8:30 every morn­
ing, half an hour before swimming lessons be­
gan. Anyone who forgot a swimming suit could 
rent one for a quarter, and boat rentals cost a 
dollar a day.  Hines and her friends passed the 
day playing card games, volleyball, or tennis, 
and working on their tans. “It was the greatest 
place in the world to be,” Hines told me.


In the evening, they gathered at the fire­
house, a few blocks landward of the beach, to 
watch the Branford Manor Drum Corps. Decked 
out in beige slacks, white shirts, and red jackets 
with gold buttons, the Corps marched up and 
down the street, playing their instruments. 
Hines and her friends marched right behind 
them.  


“We just passed the time away together,” 
Hines said. “And that’s what it was all about.”  


The golden age of Cosey Beach came to a 
close after the Second World War. Develop­
ment in the second half of the twentieth cen­
tury brought a new, retirement-age crowd to 
the area. Joseph Vegliante, who built about 
three-dozen houses in East Haven at the time, 
credits the boom to the low interest rates of the 
seventies.


Some long-time residents remain, but they 
agree with Johnson and Tait that the beach 
has been shrinking over the past century. The 
sand that used to be on the beach is not, how­
ever, gone—it’s just sitting out there in the Long 
Island Sound. And that means that people can 
bring it back. With the right technology and 
enough money, they can pull sand up from the 
bottom of the Sound and move it back onto the 
beach. Beach erosion plagues coastal towns 
around the United States, and people have been 
replenishing beaches up and down the Atlantic 
coastline. The Army Corps of Engineers carries 
out the work, and any nonfederal government 
body—a city, a state, or a special tax district, for 
example—can apply to receive this service.  


Over fifty years ago, the Army Corps re­
plenished the beach of West Silver Sands, 
which lies directly to the west of Cosey Beach 
Avenue. West Silver Sands resident Donald Di­
Palma said that his house sustained little dam­
age in Irene and Sandy, for which he credits the 
Army Corps. 


But DiPalma has noticed that the beach is 
smaller than it used to be, even after replenish­
ment. More than half the sand added in 1956 
has already eroded. DiPalma is meeting with 
officials from Connecticut’s Department of 
Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) 
to secure permits for another replenishment 
project. They need the permits before they can 
apply to the Army Corps. DiPalma doesn’t ex­
pect anything to happen for a few months.


Irene inspired Cosey Beach residents to take 
action. State Senator Len Fasano held a meeting 
in September 2012, about a year and a month 
after the storm, to inform residents about their 
options for keeping their shoreline homes safe. 
One option was to apply to the Army Corps for 
beach replenishment.  


At that meeting, Virginia Cellura, a full-
time resident of Cosey Beach Avenue, volun­
teered to coordinate community efforts to 
replenish the beach. She assembled a team to 
gather information about what would be re­
quired to complete the replenishment and to 
distribute that information to residents. Hillel

Auerbach is a New Haven lawyer, and he volun­
teered for the project.


In order to petition the Army Corps, the 
residents needed to apply as a tax district, 
rather than a group of individuals. Residents 
planned to fund the project with a tax to be 
levied upon the district, but they didn’t know 
exactly how much it would cost. Rough esti­
mates from the Army Corps ranged from five 
to ten thousand dollars per house, said Steven 
Ruotolo, who rents property on Cosey Beach 
Avenue. But, mired by miscommunication and 
misinformation, the project fell apart after a 
few meetings. The group has not yet been able 
to form a district, much less petition the Army 
Corps. Cellura has since handed off the reins to 
another Cosey Beach resident, who will soon be 
re-launching the effort to petition the town for 
the creation of the district.  


But even if the residents can get the Army 
Corps to restore some of the sand, it won’t re­
main on the beach for long. Dumping sand on 
top of a beach might make the beach larger, but 
it’s a temporary solution—it’s only a matter of 
time before the water sweeps it back out to sea. 
It’s like building a sand castle. You pack sand 
into buckets and then overturn them, forming 
turrets. You form a wall around your structure, 
patting it all down to make it last. But all you 
did was put something in the way of the water. 
Eventually, the water will wash the sand away. 
“It’s sort of a Sisyphean task,” Tait laughed.


This has happened to beach replenish­
ment projects in other parts of the country. 
The Army Corps has replenished Wrightsville 
Beach, North Carolina, twelve times from 1939 
to 1986. The sand never stuck around for more 
than four years.  


Even so, Tait thinks that beach replenish­
ment is the best solution for the residents of 
Cosey Beach Avenue. Moving the sand from 
the Sound to the shore could protect more 
homes, even if it’s just for now.  Beyond that, 
Tait thinks that the only long-term fix is mov­
ing away.  Many residents are trying; at the end 
of November, at least eight houses along Cosey 
Beach Avenue sported “For Sale” signs.  Wein­
stein has been trying to sell his property for the 
past two years, but hasn’t received a single of­
fer.  Residents say that they haven’t seen any­
one new in the neighborhood in years.  


Some, like Weinstein, could retreat to other 
homes away from the beach. But others have 
nowhere else to go, and policymakers are at a 
loss for how to help them. In late January, a Con­
necticut state agency determined that home­
owners who want the government to buy their 
homes would get no money from a recent grant 
from Federal Emergency Management Agency 
(FEMA). The committee decided that all FEMA 
funds would go to infrastructure projects in­
stead. In a January 31 letter, however, Governor 
Malloy directed the committee to reconvene 
and reconsider their allocation of funds. 


Local legislators presume that state money 
will likewise be unavailable. James Albis, East 
Haven’s state representa­
tive, said he isn’t aware of 
any 
conversations 
about 
state-funded buyback pro­
grams for coastal proper­
ties in dangerous areas, but 
he is concerned with the 
state’s ability to fund such a program. And in 
Connecticut, municipalities have jurisdiction 
over zoning—cities can decide who can build 
what where. Towns like East Haven have an 
incentive to promote development, even in po­
tentially dangerous areas, Albis said, because 
more development means more property taxes. 
He knows that people shouldn’t build homes in 
hazardous places, and he has had conversations 
privately at the state level to try to change zon­
ing laws. “It’s an uphill battle,” Albis told me.  


Meanwhile, at the town level, East Haven 
has its own battles. It wants to help people who 
lost property during the storm, but also recog­
nizes the need to adapt to a changing environ­
ment. For now, the scales are tipping toward 
short-term assistance. “We’ve done our best to 
get people back to normalcy as quickly as pos­
sible,” said Frank Biancur Jr., East Haven’s di­
rector of planning and zoning.  His board has 
approved all permits to rebuild and elevate 
homes on Cosey Beach Avenue, but he can do 
little more. “We can’t force people to come in 
and rebuild,” he said.  


Higher-level government agencies have 
different priorities. Dan Esty, who was the 
commissioner of DEEP during both hurricanes, 
put it bluntly: “A number of people are either 
going to have to move their houses back from 
the shoreline, lift them up on support struc­
tures, or otherwise change the placement of 
their homes.”  Instead of returning people to 
normal—what their lives were like before Irene 
and Sandy—Esty urges them to look toward a 
new normal.


Some have come to that decision them­
selves. At first, Weinstein thought he was going 
to rebuild his house.  He applied for permis­
sion to rebuild along with the Auerbachs, and 
both families got zoning approval and commis­
sioned construction plans.  A few months after 
the storm, Weinstein testified at an insurance 
hearing. His homeowners insurance was deny­
ing him money to pay for damages they claimed 
were caused by water, which was not covered, 
as opposed to wind, which would be. 


At the hearing, Wein­
stein met Albis. Impressed 
by Weinstein’s insight and 
passion, Albis invited Wein­
stein to join the Shoreline 
Preservation Task Force, a 
committee chaired by Al­
bis about how to protect coastal communities. 
Composed of legislators and other citizens, the 
committee produced a report last year with rec­
ommendations to local, state, and federal agen­
cies on how to reduce damage in future storms.  


The more Weinstein learned about erosion 
and rising sea levels, the more he realized that 
rebuilding his house on the beach was a bad 
idea. He didn’t want to be saddled with beach­
front property that would keep disappear­
ing before his eyes. “I’ve probably got another 
twenty years,” Weinstein said. “That’s twenty 
more years of beach erosion.” That means twen­
ty more years of worrying about the security of 
his house and twenty more years of paying to 
raise it, move it back, or replenish the beach.


The tipping point was when he looked 
at maps created by the Nature Conservancy, 
which show what the coastline looks like after 
hurricanes of varying magnitudes. A category 2 
hurricane that would arrive in 2020 will likely 
put Cosey Beach Avenue, and some roads be­
hind it, underwater.  


Others hope it is possible for humans to 
overcome these threats. Sara-Ann, with her 
thirteen-foot-high concrete pillars, says she 
hopes her grandchildren will have a beach to 
play on. Hines is even less worried, and finds
