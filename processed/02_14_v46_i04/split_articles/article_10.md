Lost and Found
The trees on the New Haven Green are some­
how unexpected. Many of their old trunks are 
too wide to measure with outstretched arms, 
and yet I might not have paid attention to them 
in all the open space. It was the maps of New 
Haven that have taught me to truly look at 
them. One map, from 1748, marks out two trees 
on the Green and labels each of them—“2 Trees 
Planted in 1686”—the way a church or town hall 
might be identified. I cannot find them, and I 
doubt that they still stand centuries later.


The earliest map of New Haven, drawn 
in 1641 by John Brockett, depicts the city as 
a swath of white space bounded by today’s 
George, York, Grove, and State streets. The area 
is divided into nine squares, each square subdi­
vided by labeled divisions of land: a thin black 
line divides Richard Perry’s two and a half acres 
from Theophilus Eaton’s; Stephen Goodyear’s 
plot borders that of William Hawkins. The order 
provided by the map indicates neither cardinal 
directions nor street names, only the nine large 
rectangles and the smaller ones within them—
broad outlines of a mostly uncharted place. 


Over the course of three and a half centu­
ries, those nine squares have become increas­
ingly detailed, in construction and in represen­
tation. In a map from the eighteenth century, 
the allotments of land of the Brockett map be­
come color-coded and labeled sketches of build­
ings. On several nineteenth-century maps, the 
relative sizes of blocks approach an accurate 
measure. A 1929 aerial photograph captures as 
much detail as technology could provide at the 
time: streets and buildings, cars and awnings, 
and the thin and shadowy branches of trees. 


Maps create distance from places—they 
provide perspectives that inherently zoom out 
from the reality of experiences like walking 
down the street. Yet they echo experience, and 
can often augment it. For me, this has been true 
as long as I can remember. I grew up surround­
ed by maps that told me where I was in the 
world, and where I could go. I spent afternoons 
poring over the already-dated eighties atlas my 
father passed down to me, tracing routes and 
town names with my fingers; I ate many bowls 
of macaroni-and-cheese on a placemat with a 
U.S. map; I helped navigate family road trips 
to national parks with highway maps that, un­
folded, were bigger than me. 


My first experiences in cities far from 
home always begin with a lack of meaning, 
swaths of blank space. I only know that the 
streets are unfamiliar, sometimes winding, 
and infinitely detailed. At most, I know several 
broad strokes—a river, a central square, the di­
rection the sun sets against a bell tower. But 
after an hour of walking, I can learn the perim­
eter of any neighborhood, some outlined terra 
incognita. Once I learn peripheral streets, I can 
let myself get lost on side streets and in court­
yards, knowing that if I wander long enough, I 
will happen upon a familiar street I’ve already 
learned. Broad strokes, then specifics, a frac­
tal-like system of zooming in, and zooming in. 


For a long time, I have imagined that I no 
longer need a map to experience New Haven—
I have convinced myself that a map of the city 
exists in my mind. I can visualize buildings 
with their various shapes, streets with their 
diagonal sidewalks between them. I have long 
stopped looking for the ornate designs of roof­
tops against blue skies, and dismiss the dif­
ference between rust and russet bricks on Old 
Campus. The city feels dense with its own pri­
vate meanings, with a history I cannot access.


And yet the New Haven maps I’ve looked at

the new journal
reveal unseen details and rich patterns layered 
one over the other. On the Green, I remember 
only the rough sketch of the 1748 map—and 
the space I experience is beyond what paper 
and ink can record. The wind is cold. There are 
no people on the benches. But because of that 
map, I know to look for old and knotted trees.
