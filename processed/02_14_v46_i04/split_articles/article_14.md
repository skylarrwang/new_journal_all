a weekend in Pittsburgh at an environmental 
conference called Power Shift.
I first saw the city from the height of a stage­
coach bus. Along with over six thousand college 
students, I was headed toward a giant white 
convention center, to one of the largest envi­
ronmentalist conferences in the country. 
I had imagined that Power Shift would look 
like Woodstock in 1969. And it did, if Woodstock 
had involved Twitter, an advertising team, and 
a weekend-long agenda of workshops and pan­els. Despite the attendees’ youth and leftist ten­
dencies, corporate America loomed.  Gaggles 
of white girls with dreadlocks in baggy pants 
hula-hooped while on a break from sessions 
like “Environmental Justice 101.” Nearby, a 
young black man in thick-rimmed glasses rode 
a bike around the lobby holding a sign that read, 
“PROTECT APPALACHIAN 
COMMUNITIES.” But con­
ference goers were never 
very far away from the lob­
by featuring Coca-Cola ad­
vertising and a Sierra Club 
table touting merchandise 
for “Swag Prices!”  
Since Power Shift be­
gan in 2007, its members 
have met every two years to plan protests and 
form advocacy groups on issues such as frack­
ing, tar sands, and environmental justice. This 
year, in Pittsburgh, they wanted to focus on 
grassroots strategies. Power Shift chose the 
location because Pittsburgh is the first Ameri­
can city to ban “dirty and dangerous fracking,” 
according to the promotional materials at the 
conference. They further claim that the mea­
sure was all the more impressive because Pitts­
burgh is within a few hours of the coal mines of 
West Virginia and the shale gas fields of Penn­
sylvania. 
Looking outside the convention center 
window to Pittsburgh’s old factories and black-
and-yellow bridges, I saw a city built on fossil 
fuels. Pittsburgh largely owes its existence to 
the energy-intensive steel industry. But inside 
the lobby of the David L. Lawrence Convention 
Center, I couldn’t feel further from the heart of 
coal country.
It was hard to tell if other Power Shift at­
tendees were worried about the contradictions 
of this “green” convention and the potential pit­
falls of “green-washing.” Just looking at what 
we were wearing, you could tell we were a divid­
ed group. The granola-crunching hippies wore 
baggy pants; the trendy urban hipsters dripped 
with asymmetrical jewelry; the eco-conscious 
yuppies-to-be sported Patagonia; the moody 
anarchists wore all black. And underneath the 
surface, there lay more important, less visible 
philosophical distinctions. 
There were the students who had come 
to learn about green energy and divestment, 
including many members of Fossil Free Yale. 
These environmentalists liked that the con­
vention center was gold LEED-certified, but 
its walls also sported ads touting Pittsburgh’s 
commitments to “progress” and “industry.” 
They differ enormously from activists like 
Ariana Shapiro, the Yale student who organized 
the trip to Power Shift. Shapiro is not a current 
member of Fossil Free Yale, 
though her work was key to 
the group’s campaign in the 
2012-2013 school year. She 
quit this past fall, frustrated 
with 
divestment’s 
accep­
tance of the assumptions of 
modern industrial capital­
ism. Shapiro considers her­
self a grassroots, front-line 
environmental activist, and she sees social and 
economic reform as central to the movement. 
Many activists share her trepidation, feeling 
that divestment lacks the social vision of more 
radical environmentalism.
Shapiro is from Ithaca, New York, where 
reserves of natural gas lay in wait, and under 
threat of being extracted by fracking. Her fight 
for her home community played a major role 
in her decision to take a year off between high 
school and Yale. During that year, she dedicated 
herself to fighting fossil fuel production, even 
getting arrested in Washington, D.C. alongside 
Bill McKibben, an environmental activist and 
the mastermind behind the current movement 
to divest from fossil fuels. Shapiro takes care 
to point out, however,  that she comes from 
a white, middle-class background, while the 
consequences of environmental destruction 
have hit lower income, non-white communities 
hardest. 
Activists from these affected communities 
were less prevalent among Power Shift attend­
ees, but discussions of race, class, and privilege

were not absent. Kimberly Wasserman, one 
of the weekend’s best-received speakers, had 
organized a campaign to shut down two of the 
dirtiest coal plants in the country to protect 
herself, her son, and her Chicago neighborhood 
from asthma and economic decline. She came 
to Power Shift to ask people to stop focusing 
on big “green” campaigns like divestment and 
to start a conversation about the underlying 
issues, like an economic system that creates 
ever-expanding production and consumption 
at the cost of marginalizing certain popula­
tions. A large percentage of her community is 
unemployed, she said, leaving them vulnerable 
to joining companies that engage in practices 
that are not only environmentally dangerous 
but also dangerous for the 
health of her son and her 
neighbors. “We don’t need 
that junk,” Wasserman said. 
“What we need is an invest­
ment in our communities.” 
Divestment can potentially 
serve as a key to this kind 
of real environmental and 
social change. On the last 
day of the conference, I met 
Prexy Nesbitt, who fought 
apartheid with the African 
National Congress, the po­
litical party that eventually 
came to govern post-apartheid South Africa. He 
drew comparisons between what divestment 
meant in the nineties and what it could mean 
now. 
“Divestment is a good answer,” he said. “But 
it becomes a good answer to the extent that 
we link it to other issues. It cannot be done in 
a vacuum.” 
Nesbitt told me what I hadn’t wanted to 
admit: an institution like Yale may not want 
to widen its campaign to address the social is­
sues that are underwritten in the environmen­
tal crisis. Yale’s resistance to divesting from 
apartheid, despite its clear social harm, does 
not bode well. 
Yet it is universities’ very resistance to 
campus divestment movements that can help 
move environmentalism beyond the rhetoric of 
saving the Earth. The environment has always 
been in flux. The crisis is whether the human 
species will be able to survive in the environ­
ment we are creating—or, more trickily, which 
members of the species will not just survive, 
but also live well. The climate change crisis is, 
at its root, about more than the trees or the po­
lar bears. It is about the health and survival of 
human societies.
After Power Shift, I knew that several other 
members of Fossil Free Yale wanted to change 
the course of Yale’s history and make a suc­
cessful, socially-based movement on campus 
in addition to advocating for divestment. They 
wanted a campaign aligned with cultural and 
social justice groups.  At the first meeting after 
the conference, on November 3, I pitched the 
idea.
“This school claims to stand for liberal, 
humanitarian values. Let’s 
tear that down,” I said, with 
the shantytowns on Bei­
necke Plaza in mind. 
But I was shot down 
quickly. “I think incorporat­
ing social justice detracts 
from what we’re trying to 
do,” said Sam Miller, a stu­
dent at the Yale School of 
Forestry who also attended 
Power Shift this year, and 
who had attended before. 
Miller says he isn’t against 
furthering human rights, 
but that he thinks environ­
mental campaigns get too bogged down by at­
tempting to incorporate every affiliated social 
campaign. Others redirected our focus. Fossil 
Free Yale needed to concentrate on the upcom­
ing student referendum, they said. For weeks, 
the group’s leaders had been preparing for the 
student vote on whether or not Yale should di­
vest. 
Over half of the undergraduates voted be­
tween November 17 and 20, and the referen­
dum passed with eighty-three percent of votes. 
Fossil Free Yale has gained momentum to push 
the student body to get more serious about 
pressuring the administration to divest. 
But the question remains: what will that 
push look like? I worry that it won’t transform 
into a social justice campaign—and that it won’t 
work.
Despite the referendum’s success, even the 
less-ambitious process of divestment will not

come easily at Yale. Since the referendum, Fos­
sil Free Yale has been negotiating with Yale’s 
trustees on assessing environmental metrics. 
But the decision to divest will ultimately fall 
to the Corporation, and if they say no to divest­
ment, the situation could escalate. 
Bill McKibben said it himself: when univer­
sity investors refuse to divest, the campaign 
starts to move in a more radical direction. 
“What it means,” he explained, “is we can start 
fighting with a little less restraint.” 
McKibben believes that my generation is 
more inclined to respect authority than our 
predecessors at Woodstock, and rightfully so—
but we will have to resist authority more openly 
to produce the change we desire.  
Yale activists may already be headed in 
this direction. Fossil Free Yale’s new logo fea­
tures an image of windmills planted firmly in 
the ground, a widely-recognized symbol for 
divestment—but its orange square comes from 
the red square that epitomized the 2012 Que­
bec student protests against rising tuition. The 
time will come when Fossil Free Yale will have 
to act on the radical message symbolized in this 
logo, and when it does, maybe it will push all so­
cial groups on campus to make a serious social 
statement about their cause. 
If we really want to stop climate change, 
the divestment movement needs to be about 
more than just divestment. We also need to 
challenge ourselves to confront uncomfortable 
issues of race and inequality that underpin our 
environmental crisis. Fossil Free Yale needs to 
look beyond the current, short-term conversa­
tion about our school’s divestment. It’s time to 
remember that human communities are the 
most important part of the ecosystem we are 
fighting for.
