O
n your way up Whalley Avenue to the Stop 
& Shop in New Haven, you pass a Papa 
John’s, a Burger King, and a rundown Ja­
maican food cart. Further down, you can stop 
at  Subway, or McDonald’s. Every block or two, 
a convenience store appears. Mostly, though, 
this avenue—and the surrounding residential 
neighborhood—is all about fast food.


But quick calories aren’t everything when 
it comes to feeding a community. Fourteen per­
cent of New Haven residents are what sociolo­
gists call “food-insecure,” meaning they don’t 
have a regular or reliable supply of nutritious 
food. The problem is largely caused by food des­
erts: areas without easy access to a supermar­
ket, in which lower-income communities lack 
the cars to shop at faraway supermarkets and 
the financial resources to shop at small, high-
end food stores.  


New Haven’s only major supermarket, 
Shaw’s, closed in 2010. For almost a year, the 
city’s low-income residents had few food op­
tions. They could go up the street to Popeye’s—
where food stamps are not accepted—or they 
could go down the street to Edge of the Woods, 
a small natural foods store where food stamps 
can be used to buy pricey organic fruits and 
vegetables. They could also take a series of bus­
es to the closest supermarket, which, for most 
New Havenites, is prohibitively troublesome 
and time-consuming. 


Then, within six months of each other, two 
new shopping centers popped up, a corporate 
giant and a custom-designed cooperative. The 
opening of Stop & Shop and Elm City Market in 
2011 was trumpeted as the solution to New Ha­
ven’s food issues. But the way that they opened, 
and the way that these markets are now operat­
ing, sheds light on the strange, arid landscape 
that is New Haven’s food deserts.


When I first meet Kate Walton in the upstairs 
conference room of the Stop & Shop on Whalley, 
she is wearing a neat green Christmas sweater 
and clogs. Somehow, even her innocuous pas­
tels and curled blonde hair contributes to her 
intimidating aura. Almost as soon as I arrive, 
she thrusts a report on Community Food Secu­
rity in Connecticut at me with a French-mani­
cured hand. Walton then hands me a folder of 
meticulous notes from her ten-year tenure at 
the Connecticut Food Bank. The notes detail 
inefficiencies in the food bank’s administra­
tion and the problems she encountered on an 
everyday basis. In Walton’s world, New Haven’s 
various social problems all connect to food. She 
connects malnutrition to low birth-weights, 
children doing poorly in school, and gang vio­
lence. Walton understands food as central to a 
community’s success. 


Walton is currently the community rela­
tions coordinator at Stop & Shop, but my first 
conversations with her are all about soup kitch­
ens. Though she was a central player in bringing 
the supermarket to the city, her path took her 
first through the food assistance system. Her 
career includes almost two decades heading 
the Fellowship Place, an organization that pro­
vides services for people with mental illness, 
and a decade at the Connecticut Food Bank, 
where she distributed five million pounds of 
government food throughout the state each 
year—of which New Haven received about two 
million pounds. 


During her tenure, she founded a number 
of programs aimed at relieving the city’s food 
deserts. One was a mobile pantry truck that 
carried as much as ten tons of food in refriger­
ated compartments, making the rounds in New 
Haven three times a month to distribute food 
to the elderly, the disabled, and people without 
access to a car. Another was the Kids’ Backpack 
program, aimed at children who got most of 
their nutrition from school lunches; teachers 
slipped boxed food into their backpacks in or­
der to keep them fed through the weekends. 
Walton is still waiting on a grant for a program 
to help distribute food to seniors. 


She sums up her work matter-of-factly: 
“There is an incredible network of relief pro­
grams, but the fact is, most people want to get 
their food from a supermarket.” For many, 
shopping for food means both independence 
and choice.


In 1979, Walton was a young mother living 
near Elm Street with her two children when 
the small grocery store that served the entire 
Dwight neighborhood shut down. When no 
plans for a new supermarket materialized, she 
re-located Fellowship Place to the old lot. Over 
a decade after the supermarket closed, when 
auto shops were so ubiquitous that Whalley 
Avenue was called “Automobile Avenue,” Wal­
ton also joined a new community organization, 
the Greater Dwight Development Corporation 
(GDDC), in its efforts to recruit a large chain su­
permarket into the area. New Haven’s reputa­
tion, however, made it difficult.


“The other towns with Shaw’s were much 
more desirable,” Walton said. “Desirable,” for 
supermarkets, is often synonymous with “sub­
urban.” In affluent suburbs, residents spend 
more money on foods with high profit mar­
gins, like fancy cheeses and chocolate truffles. 
New Haven’s population, though, encompasses 
a broad range of  socioeconomic backgrounds. 
Yale students on the dining plan pay $12.46 
for a single buffet-style dinner; some of those 
students live next door to families who stretch 
less than two hundred dollars a month in food 
stamps into breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 


In 2000, GDDC finally persuaded Shaw’s to 
open a site on Whalley Avenue. It was the first 
time in twenty years that the neighborhood had 
a convenient supermarket. But in 2010, after a 
decade of serving the Dwight Street commu­
nity, the corporation that owned Shaw’s made 
the choice to close all eighteen Shaw’s branches 
in Connecticut. Sixteen other locations were 
promptly purchased by other supermarket 
chains, but New Haven, by far the poorest of 
those cities according to census data, remained 
empty. After months working to find a store to 
fill the space, the GDDC had received scattered 
offers from discount stores, but none from full-
service supermarket chains.


New Haven finally got its Stop & Shop 
through a combination of serendipity and re­
lentless work, with Walton at the center of it 
all. In the winter of 2010, the Wexler-Grant
