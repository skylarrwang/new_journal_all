EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Like a faint gray smudge sullying a building’s side—the only trace of the burned-down house that once 
stood next door—my photographs seek out the unexpected ways in which the natural and the man-
made are intertwined. Rather than finding an easy division between the two, the images create an 
artificial naturalness and a natural artificiality. Along the way, I use both so-called “pure” observation 
and digital alteration; at times, I physically construct my own scenes. Seeing is as active as making: 
there is no such thing as a photograph that has not been manipulated. My photographs are not abso­
lute statements; they only offer a possible way of seeing.
