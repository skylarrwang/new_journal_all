O
n a Sunday afternoon last Septem­
ber, the three musicians started to 
groove. The fiddle wailed, and the bass 
ba-dummed. “We got this battle,” the 
melodica-player crooned, “We’re gonna sit in 
their office, get a fossil free Yale.” It was a real-
life protest song, the twenty-first century Pete 
Seeger. I knew it was corny. But as a folk musi­
cian myself, I couldn’t help but feel excited. 
 “Welcome!” said a tall blond woman in a 
white summer dress. She introduced herself 
as Diana Madson, a second-year student at the 
Yale School of Forestry. She looked like just 
about everyone else in the room: attractively 
but casually dressed, slim, white. “Together, 
you, me, everyone here—we are Fossil Free 
Yale,” Madson continued. “And we are happy 
you’re here, because the more people we have, 
the more likely we are to get the university to 
divest from the fossil fuel industry.” 


We were in a classroom in WLH  to talk 
about how to convince Yale to sell its stocks 
in energy companies with high emissions to 
considerably dent the fossil fuel industry. Fos­
sil Free Yale was preparing for a Yale College 
Council student referendum in November to 
gauge the level of support among undergradu­
ates for divestment. They would then present 
the referendum’s results to Yale’s Advisory 
Committee on Investor Responsibility. The ref­
erendum, the first in the school’s history, was 
a landmark push for a democratic voice in uni­
versity governance. 


Fossil Free Yale’s proposal asked that the 
university investigate one hundred coal com­
panies and one hundred oil and gas companies 
identified by a 2011 Carbon Tracker Initiative 
report as having the largest carbon reserves. 
If a company refuses to disclose its emissions 
data, Yale’s investment managers would then 
request the data. And if the company did not 
release the information within a business 
quarter, Yale would divest over two years. Com­
panies that already make high level of emis­
sions known have just one business quarter to 
implement a plan to clean up their progress. If 
they didn’t don’t make sufficient progress, Yale 
would divest over two years. 


At $20.8 billion, Yale has the second-largest 
university endowment in the country, smaller 
only than Harvard’s. Students at Yale who sup­
port the divestment campaign believe that this 
gives Yale the power to make a large impact on 
the environmental practices of energy compa­
nies.


But critics of divestment say that impact 
would be temporary at best. If Yale sold its 
stocks in fossil fuels, some hedge fund manag­
er would buy them up, said Jonathan Macey, the 
chair of Yale’s Advisory Committee on Investor 
Responsibility. And what difference would that 
really make for the environment? The shares 
would be bought and used anyway, and Yale 
wouldn’t make any profit.


Madson countered that divestment has 
symbolic value. “Yale is a big school,” she said. 
“Everyone knows it. If we divest, it goes in the 
New York Times and sends a big message to fos­
sil fuel companies.” She hoped that they and the 
government would then be pressured into pur­
suing cleaner energy policies.


History suggests that Madson is right. In the 
mid-eighties, the divestment of 155 universi­
ties from companies that were doing business 
in apartheid South Africa helped push the U.S. 
government to pass the Comprehensive Anti-
Apartheid Act of 1986. This act imposed sanc­
tions on South Africa that were critical to end­
ing apartheid in the early nineties.


Yale fell short of playing an important role 
in this campaign, however, even after years of 
sustained student struggle for full divestment. 
In April 1986, after years of quieter campaign­
ing, students built a shantytown in Yale’s Bei­
necke Plaza to grab the administration’s atten­
tion and embarrass the university. Over seventy 
students camped out in cardboard and plastic 
shacks. They declared that they wouldn’t leave 
until the university removed its estimated 
$350 million worth of stock held in companies 
doing business in South Africa.


They stuck to their word. For ten days, they 
slept in the shanties. On a Monday evening in 
April, Yale police arrested seventy-eight peo­
ple living in the shantytown, seventy-three of 
them Yale students. Seven hundred protestors 
responded with demonstrations on Beinecke 
Plaza; national media in both the United States 
and South Africa then told their story.


The protestors were soon released on bail, 
and Yale administrators reluctantly allowed 
the shantytown to remain. The rest of spring 
brought rallies and protests to Beinecke Plaza, 
transforming a central part of campus into a 
hotbed of protest and debate. The activists even 
constructed a large wooden monument bearing 
the names of black South Africans who had died 
in the recent unrest. They paraded the monu­
ment around Beinecke Plaza in stark contrast 
with Yale’s own war monument (“In Memory of 
the Men of Yale Who Gave Their Lives So That 
Freedom Might Not Perish From the Earth”). 


The shantytown survived until 1988, when it 
was torched by a disgruntled alum at a reunion.


The Yale Corporation ultimately removed 
shares from seventeen companies doing busi­
ness in South Africa at a total market value 
of twenty-three million dollars, according to 
Yale’s Advisory Committee on Investor Re­
sponsibility. But Yale never fully divested from 
apartheid, even though the very idea of divest­
ment was born at the university. In 1972, a Yale 
professor named John Simon and two graduate 
students, Charles Powers and Jon Gunnemann, 
published a book called The Ethical Investor: 
Universities and Corporate Responsibility, ar­
guing that a university should remove its in­
vestments from a company when it is causing 
“grave social harm,” and that harm cannot be 
remedied by working with the company. Fos­
sil Free Yale hopes that this time, divestment 
at Yale will play a more critical role in affect­
ing change, rather than reacting to the political 
tide.  


The idea that divestment could bring this 
kind of student involvement—and this kind 
of success—was exciting to me. I couldn’t tell 
from the kick-off meeting if Fossil Free Yale 
was ready for this kind of political campaign. 
But I knew I wanted to find out, so I signed up 
to work with the organization. My first step:
