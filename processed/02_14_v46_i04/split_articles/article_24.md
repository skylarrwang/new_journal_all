the power of the beach compelling still: “Whatever is bothering you has gone out on the waves 
and you are at peace.”


Tait identified something encouraging 
about the attention to the situation: residents 
are being forced to realize that they’re in a 
fight with nature. What Tait doesn’t say is what 
comes next: many residents remain in denial 
about the cold truth that they’re on the los­
ing side. Some can’t leave Cosey Beach Avenue 
because they can’t sell their property, others 
are financially secure enough to weather any 
storm, and some stay adrift with nostalgia, with 
a sense of home even as the sand under them is 
swept away.

Lake
you could not say it
was the lake the
ducks often come
here a nice glide
after dark I
must say the
cold freshens their
feathers and any
way they could hardly
do better now
could they as
the sky blackens they
do so slowly
