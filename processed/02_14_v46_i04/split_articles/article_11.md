Austin Reed wrote in silence and in darkness. 
Over the course of three decades, he crafted his 
memoirs in a prison cell in upstate New York, 
where he was prohibited from speaking and 
forced to work ten hours a day. The first line 
reads: “The bright sun was just a shining into 
the window of my father cottage when I was 
call’d by the voice of a female to come and take 
the last look of my dying father.” 


Yale’s Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript 
Library acquired Reed’s manuscript in 2009 
at an estate sale in Rochester, New York; its 
whereabouts during the preceding 150 years 
remain largely unknown. Titled “The Life and 
Adventures of a Haunted Convict, or the Inmate 
of a Gloomy Prison,” and composed between the 
1830s and the 1850s, it is the earliest known 
prison narrative by a black writer. He wrote 
under the name Robert Reed. Scholars guess 
that Robert was his middle name, or that it was 
a pen name playing on the word Rob because he 
was in jail for theft. Perhaps, some speculate, it 
served as an ode to Robinson Crusoe or Walter 
Scott’s Rob Roy.


The authenticity of the manuscript was 
verified by English professor Caleb Smith in 
December using a letter Reed wrote in 1895, 
as well as court records, prison documents, and 
newspaper articles. “There is no voice quite like 
this in the literature of the period,” says Smith, 
who has written two books on incarceration 
and is preparing Reed’s text for publication in 
early 2016.


The elegant handwriting fades into the 
weathered paper, marking the moments when 
Reed ran low on ink, but the 304-page manu­
script remains highly legible a century and a 
half after its completion. The memoir moves 
from childhood anecdotes to prison conditions 
and poetic musings, from moments of denial 
and indignation to remorse and acquiescence. 
In his concluding note, written two decades af­
ter he began the memoir, Reed reflects on his 
time as a prisoner and tells the Reader to heed 
his life as a cautionary tale.


Reed resorted to theft and violence after 
the death of his father, and landed himself 
first in a Manhattan reformatory for juvenile 
delinquents that offered instruction in read­
ing and writing. He was later sent to Auburn 
State Prison, a reform institution that aimed 
to create a rehabilitative prison model. In addi­
tion to enforced silence and labor, inmates had 
to walk in lockstep to prevent them from fac­
ing one another. They were subject to punish­
ments such as shower-baths, a form of torture 
Reed describes vividly: “Stripping off my shirt 
the tyrantical curse bounded my hands fast 
in front of me and orderd me to stand around. 
Turning my back towards him he threw Sixty 
seven lashes on me according to the orders of 
Esq. Cook. I was then to stand over the dreain 
while one of the inmates wash my back in a pail 
of salt brine.” 


Reed wanted to publish the manuscript 
during his lifetime, but he never did. Perhaps 
it was censored because he was trying to ex­
pose the system, or maybe it just never got into 
the right hands. In any case, his attempt to il­
lustrate the horrors of prison firsthand put 
him in the growing group of prison reformers, 
who were closely allied with the abolitionists. 
In 1858, the year Reed completed his memoir, 
the state prison faced unwanted attention from 
the press when a black inmate was killed in the 
shower bath. “This was a sensitive issue, even at 
the time,” Smith says, “in part because the pris­
on reformers were so strongly identified with 
anti-slavery, and didn’t want people to be able 
to say about their prisons that they were racist 
institutions—that they were like slavery.”


Reed was born a free man near Rochester, 
but he faced violence from a young age. Shortly

after his father’s death, a white farmer came to 
his door to complain that Reed and his friends 
had cut down trees on his property. Reed’s 
mother, who was raising her five children 
alone, decided to give him a lashing: “She took 
a rawhide from the mantlepiece and orderd me 
to strip off my coat. I jump for the ax that stood 
behind the door and raising at my mothers head 
told her if she struck me one blow with that 
rawhide that I would sliver her brains out on the 
floor.” The farmer intervened and attempted to 
take the weapon from Reed, who cocked back 
and threw the ax at him with all the force his 
small frame could muster, leaving a deep cut 
below the farmer’s knee. Reed was six. 


He was sent to work on the farmer’s prop­
erty as retribution and recompense. Reed once 
told the farmer that he was tired of laboring 
and that he would go home to see his mother 
and siblings, and the man responded with the 
whip. No ax by his side, Reed received his lashes 
with his hands tied behind his back.


Despite the age of the manuscript, Reed’s 
narrative remains all too familiar. Though 
whippings and salt brine are no longer common 
practice, tens of thousands of inmates today 
spend twenty-two to twenty-four hours a day 
in sterile steel boxes of solitary confinement in 
most states, including Connecticut. The lights 
stay on,  and meals are served through slots 
in the doors. Rather than walking in lockstep, 
recreation entails supervised, shackled pacing. 
The U.S. still claims the highest incarceration 
rate in the world; forty percent of the country’s 
2.3 million inmates are black, disproportion­
ately representing just thirteen percent of the 
country’s population. And just as two-thirds of 
today’s American inmates end up back in prison 
within three years, Reed was reincarcerated af­
ter only a few months of freedom in 1842. 


From his dark room at the Auburn reform 
institution, Reed looked back on the moment 
beneath the white farmer’s rawhide. He wrote, 
“Then was the hour that I thought of my beloved 
who was sleeping in the grave—yes then was 
the time that I needed a father’s protection.”
