march in the morning, and came home that 
evening. McCoy said her feet were hurting, the 
weather was hot, and she’s not sure the expe­
rience was worth all the suffering. Bergmann, 
however, thinks it was worthwhile. Along with 
thousands of other Americans, members of the 
New Elm City Dream and the YCL marched in 
Washington to carry the torch lit by an earlier 
generation of civil rights leaders. Jim Crow is 
gone, but full equality of opportunity remains 
a dream—and that can make recruitment chal­
lenging for groups like Bergmann’s. 
“The conditions that people have to live in 
because of extreme racism and extreme in­
equality slow down organizing sometimes,” 
Bergmann said, “because people are trying to 
get through the day.” 

More light-hearted stories wove their way 
into this talk of street shootings and freedom 
marches. Houston told me about a time when 
they went outside McCoy’s house to play for 
a few minutes. When it started to thunder, 
McCoy got scared and ran back inside. They 
laughed at the memory, and then got up to go 
watch the breakdancing troupe performing on 
the other side of the massive dinosaur skeleton. 

If the younger members seem to not always 
know what’s going on, perhaps it’s because to 
them, the threat of violence seems as ubiqui­
tous and commonplace as a cloud cover. It’s part 
of the problem they have to grow up with, along 
with bad sandwiches and tired feet.
At the People’s Center, Jackie eventually got 
almost everyone into a circle. I was the second 
person to dance in Dance Telephone—a bless­
ing because I only had to do two dance moves 
instead of more than ten. Everyone laughed at 
me, at each other, and at themselves. 

When we sat down again, Jackie announced 
the day’s main goal: to invite adults to a special 
meeting intended to showcase the group’s work 
and recruit new supporters. Though the mem­
bers are proud of their own resourcefulness, 
adults can bring new faces to meetings, help 
with fundraising, and offer guidance. 

Soon, giggles broke out again. Kelsha Sailor 
made fun of Jennifer Graham, sixteen, for cov­
ering her mouth all the time. McCoy hid her 
face in the crook of her elbow on the table’s 
surface. Areliz Marks slouched in her chair and 
folded her arms over her chest. 
“We would have better discipline if we had 
more adults here,” Jackie said. 
“I’m thinking about it less as them disciplin­
ing you and more as your sharing your awesome 
work with them,” Bergmann responded.  She 
wants this organization to be a forum for young 
people to practice leadership and find their 
own venues for community involvement, not 
another space for adults to call the shots.
The organizers of the meeting talked about 
their marches, their survey findings, the com­
mittees that members have sat on, and their 
goals for the future, including a march for Nel­
son Mandela’s birthday in June. Canteen and 
White demonstrated how to encourage an adult 
to attend the event over the phone. Then the 
New Elm City Dream members pulled out their 
phones to start calling. 

Sailor complained that she invited her sis­
ter to the meeting and her sister didn’t come. 
“That means you keep inviting her,” Alex said. 
Jackie wanted to get the mayor’s number. 
At last week’s meeting, when they first began 
discussing the February event, Jackie almost 
seemed to be joking when she suggested invit­
ing the mayor. But Bergmann said she didn’t 
see any reason not to, and this week Jackie was 
adamant. “I need to call Toni Harp.”  

A year ago, she spoke at the New Elm City 
Dream’s Peace, Love & Jobs march, at which she 
and about seventy-five others chanted: “Jobs 
for youth, jobs for all.” They called on the city 
to offer better careers and more youth commu­
nity centers. After the march, they headed up 
Whalley Avenue to the home of Tramire Miller, 
who had been a year old when he was struck 
by a bullet in the stomach in October 2012. He 
survived, but in Jackie’s speech, she offered her 
condolences for everything he had suffered.
“And I told him when our meetings are,” 
she told me, so when he gets older he’ll know 
to come to the People’s Center at 5:30 every 
Thursday evening. “But I sounded like a baby, 
which was embarrassing.”
“You did not sound like a baby,” Bergmann 
protested.
Jackie shrugged and said she doesn’t get 
nervous in front of crowds, whether or not she 
sounds like a baby. “I don’t want to be in the 
background not talking. This is what it’s here 
for, to have your voice heard.”
