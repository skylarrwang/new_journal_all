Nota Bene 


Yale New Haven Regular Singing, 
the University's Sacred Harp singing 
ensemble, does not perform. Instead, 
its members sit in a hollow, democratic 
square, sopranos facing basses, tenors 
facing altos. Each singer is a listener, as 
well as a musician. 


The group ranges from ten to 
twenty undergrads, graduate students, 
and New Haven community members. 
Founded about a year ago by Ian Quinn, 
a professor of music theory, the group 
chatters familiarly as they wait in the 
hall for a course section to vacate their 
meeting room in William L. Harkness 
Hall on Wall Street. Some are clearly 
regulars, and others, like me, are here for 
the first time. 


In 
eighteenth-century 
New 
England, Puritans began Regular Singing 
to encourage the community to learn to 
read music and thereby. renew religious 
devotion. The usual way had been to 
pra~tice in unison a rote repertoire of 
only a handful of tunes each Sunday. 
These revivalists founded pedagogical 
singing schools, and around the turn of 
the nineteenth century, invented shape-
note music notation. From do to do, each 
syllable had a shape. La, fa, and mi were 
transcribed to the page as tiny, stalked 
squares, triangles, and diamonds, nested 
between the black bars of the staf£ To 
me, musical notes have been just dots 
on a page ever since I quit the trumpet 
in fourth grade. I can see how the 
shaped notes' simple geometry would 
make sight -singing easier and, perhaps, 
religious devotion more accessible. 


A proliferation of shape-note books 
appeared throughout New England in 
the early nineteenth century, the most 
famous of them called The Sacred Harp. 
Its tide is now the common name for 
the practice of Regular Singing. After 
many iterations and editions, the book 
is still used today. I turn a copy over in 
my hands outside room 205 of Harkness 
Hall as I wait for the meeting to begin, 
fumbling with the wide, yellow pages. 


Opening to a random page in The 
Sacred Harp, I find a song entided "Save, 
Lord, or We Perish." Below the strange-
looking notes are the words from Luke: 
"Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace." 


Despite the message of faith, the group 
is secular. ''We sing very religious music, 
without feeling like a religious group," 
says Carson Evans '13. 


It is the music, not the meaning, 
that draws some people. Charles Biada 
'13, a self-described agnostic-atheist and 
a member of the Yale Secular Student 
Alliance, has come almost every week 
since Quinn started the group. "If 
you're going to sing old music and if 
you're only going to sing songs that 
conform perfectly to your world view," 
he says, "you're 'going to find yourself 
with very few songs to sing. And all this 
old music 
the poetry, the melodies, the 
ideas 
is way too good not to sing. It's 
simple and raw and real and beautiful." 


He adds, however, "If you as a 
singer did wish to treat the songs as a 
form of prayer at the individual level, 
the atmosphere could be conducive to 
that as well. .so it's not exactly religious, 
but it's not un-religious either." 


Quinn calls everyone to order, 
joking with them and ushering me into a 
seat in the square arrangement of chairs. 


When the singing starts, we first sing 
tunes once through "on the notes," with 
fa's, so's, and Ia's, and then repeat them, 
adding ·lyrics. The music is alternately 
fast-paced and slow-moving, and it is 
uncomfortably loud at climatic moments. 
Many singers, books propped open on 
their laps or held in front of their eyes, 
let their free hands rise and fall in time 
with the music, creating an . undulating 
line of metronomes. The fading evening 
light catches rays of dust motes through 
the high mullioned windows that look 
out onto Cross Campus, where I imagine 
passers-by hear our lilting verses. 


The practice of Sacred Harp, 
sprung from the revivalist fervor of 
the same congregants who n 1ight have 
rubbed elbows with Elihu Yale in the 
wooden pews of their spare church 
naves, eventua1ly faded from the North 
during the Civil War era. Rural Baptists 
in Alabama picked up the tradition and 
preserved it by singing the music not for 
an audience, but for God and for one 
another. Since then, Sacred Harp has 
wound its way back to this university, 
which was founded in 1701 to renew 
strict theological study after Harvard 
grew too lax and too liberal for the taste 
of some New England Puritans. 


Now, though, this narrow, vaulted 
room is hardly filled with religious 
fervor. The voices of music majors 
mingle with those of atheist ex-Jews and 
Divinity School students as they sing 
together from Sacred Harp books. 


"I feel like a great deal of Yale 
activities are very achievement-based, 
which is fine 
we achieve many great 
and 
beautiful things 
here," Evans 
remarks. "But singing your heart out is 
a nice release." 


Here, the only requisite is singing 
loudly, though the group still manages 
to sound quite beautiful. 


Coming 
together to sing centuries-old hymns 
overlapping, 
swelling 
harmonies 
makes me feel like I am sitting not in 
a classroom but ·in the crowded pews 
of a colonial church 
a noteworthy 
achievement indeed.
