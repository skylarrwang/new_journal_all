(Fight with Teacher Taking 
Bets., 
One student, Esther Rose-Wilen, 
who goes to Wilbur Cross, explained to 
another student her idea behind a scene 
she'd written. "If they did treat us like 
humans,. we would be more motivated 
and stay in school." The student 
listening, Tavist Jones, a senior at High . 
School in the . Community, told her he 
understood and wouldn't cut too much 
from her scene 
he would just try to 
make that point "less vague." 
· Later, Jones stood behind a grand 
piano wrapped in a quilted cloth cover, 
quietly testing the lyrics of a rap he'd 
written for the · play, a beat issuing 
steadily from his open computer, one 
hand p9ised alertly on the keyboard. 
Jones was one of several seniors I spoke 
with who . are on track to be among 
the first to receive funds from New 
Haven Promise in a few months. Jones 
has been accepted to the University of 
Connecticut and other state schools, but 
he plans to attend DePaul University in 
Chicago if he is accepted. Like some of 
his peers, Jones does not think that 25 
percent of in-state tuition will be enough 
to influence his college decision. Then 
again, his financial situation is special. 
As he is a ward of the state, his tuition 
. will be paid for completely at in-state 
colleges and up to $21,000 at colleges 
out of state. 
"I hate 
school," he muttered 
offhandedly, showing me the rap, which 
. described his experience taking the SAT 
in a Yale classroom. His face softened, · 
and he added with irony, "I mean, life's a 
giant test anyway, so you never really get 
out of school." 
"I think everyone here is excited 
that we get a chance to speak our minds," 
he said. "This is our chance to rant about 
it. School is our life right now, and we 
don't get much of a chance to talk about 
it. Whatever is good, we're going to blow · 
it up to ~e extreme, because there isn't 
much good, we feel. Whatever's bad, 
we're going to kill it." 
Characters in the working version 
of The Education Project script include 
"bored, uncaring teacher," 
"racially 
profiled black girl trying to escape 
sp,ecial ed," and "Megan, 13, cries a lot, 
disabled, has panic attacks." Jones told 
me he hopes the Board . of Education 
will be in the audience when he and 
his classmates perform their play-
not so that the board members will be 
embarrassed, but so that "maybe if they

Mayor DeStefano told me at his office, 
"and ultimately, a middle-class creation 
strategy." Not only is the program a 
long-term investment in the economic 
potential of New Haven students, it 
could also stimulate property demand in 
the city. 
It is based on an initiative launched 
five years ago in Kalamazoo, Michigan, 
which 
has 
since 
inspired 
similar 
programs in eighteen other cities cross-
country. Unlike New Haven Promise, 
the Kalamazoo Promise stipulates no 
cutoff GPA. Students need only live in-
district to receive the scholarship, which 
can be put toward vocational school as 
well as college. "In Kalamazoo, it's about 
transforming the entire community, so 
we believe it should go to all students," 
said Bob Jorth, director of Kalamazoo 
Promise.

Census data showed an increase of five 
percent in the population of Kalamazoo 
County from 2000 to 2010, and an 
increase of 22 percent in enrollment 
in Kalamazoo Public Schools since the 
Promise program began in 2006. These 
initial data are hopeful, but it remains 
to be seen whether what worked in 
Kalamazoo will work in bigger, grittier 
New Haven.

education reform. Rather than simply 
aiming to graduate students from high 
school, educators must instead focus 
on preparing them for college so they 
can succeed in an economy where a 
college degree matters more than ever.

into public high schools. 
At a Chubb Fellowship lecture at 
Yale shortly after New Haven Promise 
was announced, DeStefano described 
"a new way of life in 
ew Haven where 
our children are born knowing that they 
can go to college and that it is expected 
that they go to college." 
That 
dream 
spreading. 
"I 
haven't seen this community react as 
enthusiastically to anything else I've seen 
in New Haven," said Will Ginsberg, 
president and CEO of the Community 
Foundation for Greater 
ew Haven, 
which administers New Haven Promise. 
At the center of public enthusiasm, 
Gins berg said, is 
Yale 
University's 
agreement to underwrite the program. 
But it's created a mild controversy among 
some Yale students, especially those who 
were participants in the Teacher Prep 
program that was cut by coincidence in 
the same week Promise was announced. 
"If this were an example of Yale caring 
about education, this is a very odd way 
to show their priorities," said Brian Bills 
'12. Bills heads the Ulysses S. Grant 
program, which places Yale students 
as teachers in New Haven during 
the summer, and he believes that the 
University should be using the money 
instead to fund research on education 
or professors who will turn more Yale 
students into teachers. 
Yet the people 
interviewed 
were less concerned with whether 
Yale decided to fund Promise with an 
eye toward its public image and more 
excited about the program's potential 
impact on the students it will help. Yale's 
investment in New Haven has grown 
since Yale President Richard Levin took 
office simultaneously with DeStefano-
New Haven Promise being a sign of 
the times 
and most are happy about 
the opportunity this has presented to 
New Haven's youth, especially if the 
University decides to fund Promise past 
these first four graduating classes. 
''There's a lot of obstacles here," 
Ginsberg added. ''No one's pretending 
school change wil1 be easy." These 
obstacles include the slowness of state-
level education reform, according to 
Ginsberg; the difficulty of publicizing 
Promise among a community not entirely 
used to focusing on college, according 
to Byrne 
and what to do when even a 
Promise worth thousands of dollars isn't 
enough to get some students to earn 
B's.

college in-state, is waiting to hear from 
Westerm and Southern Connecticut 
State University, and says that Promise 
would be a great help to his family, but 
Emery's 2.2 GPA will bar him from 
receiving Promise funds unless he is able 
to it nprove it before the end of the year.

Class of 2015 learned of its acceptance 
to Yale, but Emery was still unsure of 
his plans.

I was going through things a 
litde bit. It's a phase a lot of people go 
through. But I think that if somebody 
were to really, like, stick on me, and really 
be in my hair a lot, then I would meet the 
requirements." In the parlance of Fryer's 
study, Emery lacked the tools necessary

to convert his effort to achievement. 
Byrne and her team hope to create 
support systems and build on plans for 
systemic .reform in order to make the 
.requirements of New Haven Promise 
simple and accessible, but until that 
happens, they may have on their hands a 
case like that of Fryer's students in New 
York and Chicago. 
Emery transferred to Cross before 
his junior year in order to play on its 
basketball team. He remembered having 
trouble with the transition to Cross, 
which is one of two high schools :ranked 
in the lowest tie~ Tier ill. Students 
at Cross who spoke to me were coolly 
aware of this classification, but they 
also had their own ways to describe the 
barriers that mvironment posed to their 
success. ·~ this school there's a lot of

people make you try things, do things 
.that you really don't want to. A lot of 
kids in my classes are immature, and they 
talk over the teachers, and the teachers 
sometimes give up, and stop explaining 
the stuff, which I don't like, because I 
want to learn and it affects my grade." 
Promise would serve as a good 
incentive for Emery, if only he could 
.figure out how to earn it. "When people 
talk to me about college, I really listen, 
because I really want to go to college." 
For his classmates who are slipping 
the fastest, however, Promise may not 
matter at all. 'Teople who really don't 
care about school don't really care about 
going to college. When they hear about 
this New Haven Promise thing, they're 
just like, ~whatever. It is what it is. I 
ain't really looking forward to going to 
college."' 
Emery would not place himself 
in that group. ''I know a lot of people 
that are ttying to turn their whole lives 
around, ttying to get their GPA up, and
