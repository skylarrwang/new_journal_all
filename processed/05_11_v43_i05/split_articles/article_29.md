their fu:st two years of high school." He 
told me that he'll tty to work as hard as 
he can to earn Promise funding before 
the school year is out and that it will 
be the biggest challenge he's ever faced. 
Students 
at 
Cross 
face 
many 
challenges, most of which are rooted in 
poverty, said Michael Robin, a second-
year teacher of the lowest track of 
English at Cross. "You can rattle off a 
laundry list. Drugs, and pregnancy, and 
gangs, and taking care of your siblings, 
and taking care of your children ... " 
''These may be cha11enges, but we 
cannot allow them to be excuses for 
underachievement," Robin clarified in a 
~ 
subsequent e-mail. ''Many of my highest 
achieving students have been through 
significant struggles in their lives." 
He estimated his classes have only 
60 to 70 percent attendance on any given 
day. A 2007 study by Johns Hopkins 
University labeled Cross a "dropout 
factory," one of 14 in the state, because 
it found that only 50 percent of the 
MAY 2011 
students in the classes of 2004, 2005, 
and 2006 who entered Cross as freshmen 
graduated fouryears later. (New Haven 
Superintendent Dr. 
Reginald 
Mayo 
disputed the finding, saying that it didn't 
account for students transferring out 
of Cross into different high schools. 
Even generously corrected for that, 
the dropout rate is quite high 
about 
a quarter of students 
and the city has 
been criticized for artificially inflating its 
schools' reported graduation rates.) 
"The problem with 
ew Haven 
Promise," Robin said, "is that the people 
who need this the most aren't going to 
get this money. This money will go to 
good kids, don't get tne wrong ... The 
kids who need this the most are the kids 
who are way below the poverty line and 
the vast majority of tho e kids won't 
see a dime of this .money, because they . 
won't be able to meet the standards this 
program asks for." He emphasized the 
importance of attracting goo<L new 
teachers to the district to help srudents 
• 
.reach their goals. 

The people behind New Haven 
Promise are aware of the hurdles they 
face, and alongside the scholarship 
they've unveiled a detailed plan to support 
students in reaching the program's 
requirements. They plan to begin talk 
of college with students and parents in 
the elementary schools, and flag each 
year students who have slipped below 
Promise standards. They plan to create a 
College Corps of community adults who 
will go door-to-door explaining what 
students need for college to parents who 
may not even hav-e finished high school 
They have partnered with College 
Summit to bring a pilot curriculum about 
applying to college into the classroom at 
Cooperative Arts and Humanities High 
chool, and ~'ill extend this program to 
two more high schools next year.

a teacher at 
Cro s who asked not to be named told 
me that the most effective recent change 
at the school was reducing its size.

The sign outside Wilbur Cross High School. 


Over the past five years, the population 
of Cross has been reduced by about 
four hundred students transferring to 
recently opened magnet schools. Now, 
the hallways at Cross are less crowded, 
so there are fewer fights. 

The teacher showed me a cell phone 
video taken by a student of a fight 
between two other students. One male 
student lunges at another, sending the 
pair spinning noisily against the orange, 
red, and yellow lockers. At least one more 
cell phone recording the fight is visible 
in the frame, and onlookers are shouting. 


Afterward, the teacher said, the attacked 
student suffered a cerebral hemorrhage, 
and his attacker was expelled. "Our job 
in fights is just to ignore them," the 
teacher told me. Instead, fights fall under 
the purview of security guards. ''Kids 
are very used to it." 

f you're a student at one of New 
Raven's public schools, by this point 
in the school year, you may have given 
a bit of thought to what you'd like to 
do after you graduate. You might be 
among the 42 percent of seniors living 
in-district who hive applied for funding 
from 
ew Haven Promise. Or, your 
plans might not involve college at all. 

Brian Flanagan, a guidance counselor at 
Cross, was careful to say that he's happy 
to point his students toward vocational 
schools or employment if thafs what 
is right for them. (Of New Haven 
Promise, he said, "Sure, they'll pay for 
college, but you'll have a lot of families 
where the student will just need to go to 
work after graduating school to support · 
their family.") 


You might be one of the lucky ones. 
You might be like Donald Walker, a senior 
·at Metropolitan Business Academy who 
this September will become a first-
generation college student, thanks in part 
to the funds he'll receive from Promise. 
He wants to earn a degree in history and 
become a teacher. For now, he has a job 
at the Peabody Museum, pushing the 
fossil cart and explaining the museum's 
exhibits to visitors. Walker described 
his 27- and 25-year-old brothers as 
''rebellious," saying, ''I saw from both 
my brothers' mistakes." 

You might be like Victoria Ortiz, 
also a senior at Metropolitan Business 
Academ~ 
whose 
grandmother 
immigrated to New Haven from Puerto 
Rico, long ago. Orr iz feels deep loyalty 
to the city. "When you grow up in a 
communicy," she told me, "you should 
want to give back." She wants to study 
to become a nurse because after her 
hospitalization during a bout of sickness 
her freshman year, Ortiz felt indebted 
to her nurses' kindness. Her mother, 
who is single, lost her job after talcing 
off too much time to care for Ortiz, so 
'"'ew Haven Promise will be important 
in helping Ott iz to become a first-
generation college student this fall. 

You might be like Maria Arnold, a 
senior at High School in the Community 
who is also about to receive Promise 
funds. and 
become 
another 
first-
generation college student. Arnold has 
been accepted to Trinity College, where 
she hopes to engage in a genomics 
research program. After college, she 
' 
p. 
wants to pursue research in cancer 
a. 
and diabetes 
and has "since fifth i 
,, c -
grade," she said. ' 
ow, even more so. 

{. 
The guidance counselor's daughter has 



leukemia, and my grandfather died from 
cancer." 

For her birthday, a friend gave 
Arnold a dorm-room sized fridge, and 
over the next few weeks, Arnold plans 
to tour Trinity and the other schools 
she's been accepted to. She is quiet, with 
long brown hair, and is an enthusiastic 
reader. She recently read Hamlet with her 
AP English class and made it a personal 
project to commit to memory the 
prince's most famous speech. 

''Whether 'tis nobler in the mind 
. 
to suffer the slings and arrows of 
outrageous fortune ... " 

Meanwhile, the staff of New 
Haven Promise has been touring the city 
in order to inform students and parents 
about what's possible. At a meeting in 
the community room of Quinnipiac 
Terrace, a public housing project on the 
river in Fair Haven, a predominantly 
Latino neighborhood in the eastern part 
of the city, Adriana Arreola, who works 
in the Promise office, said, ''New Haven 
Promise is a scholarship and support 
program. We're not about just giving out 



money." 

The handful of people assembled 
included 
a 
few 
members of 
the 
community who started an after-school 
homework club for the neighborhood 
because many of the children there live 
with grandparents who may not speak 
English or be able to help them. They 
were quiet, attentive, nodding. They took 
the glossy pamphlets 
"School Change 
Begins With Me," "Making the Promise 
of College a Reality" 
and asked only 
how they could best help get the word 
out to parents and students. 

''We have at least five seniors I can 
think of. Very bright," said Demetria 
McMillian, one of the residents. But 
none of them were there yet. ''We wish 
they would have come out tonight. We 
were really trying to connect them with 
you. " 

''It's like expanding their world to 
show them the choice,'"' said Mary Anne 
Moran, another resident, of New Haven 
Promise. 

Finally, after several minutes, one 
of the parents whom McMillian was 
awaiting arrived, his teenage daughter 
in tow. "That's my sunshine," he saia 
proudly, in accented English, as she 
took a pamphlet. She had to get going 
to choir rehearsal soon, he said, but in 
the meantime, he wanted her to hear 
about New Haven Promise. There was, 
after all, the chance she'd be among 
the first few generations of scholarship 
recipients. And then there was the chance 
she would not, the possibility that she'd 
end up someplace besides college, the 
cards stacked against her by history and 
• c.t.rcnmstance. 

For the 
time 
being, 
however, 
Arreola switched to Spanish as she, the 
father, and the student opened the door 
to an adjacent room, where they'd talk 
over the details.
