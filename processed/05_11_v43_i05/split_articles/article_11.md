in Heaven, we are grateful to be able 
to have Institute today, to discuss the 
problems of life and put the• n in the 
light and perspective of Scripture. In the 
name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

Institute is just a short name for 
Institutes of Religion, the program 
whereby the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints provides for and 
~ 
educates those I .DS students going 
to school outside of Brigham Young 
University. I'm visiting to hear Brother 
Stephen Weber lead today's lunchtime 
class at the New Haven Institute of 
Religion, which students from Yale, 
Quinnipiac, and other schools in the 
area attend in this Trumbull Street 
church. Yes, this is a church, but ifs 
an educational institute first 'We're 
turning it into a greater-use building," 
Brother Weber says. The fourth floor 
is a welcoming space because of the 
skylights, particularly on a nice sunny 
day like today, and there's a foosball table 
.and a ping-pong table and air hockey 
and bi1Iiards. If you just want to come 
here to relax or study, you're of course 
welcome any time. 

Anyone who shows up later wi11 
just have to trust that the food has 
been blessed. Brother Weber is serving 
drinks. Apple juice, grape juice, or 
Sprite. He admonishes a congregant 
to serve himself a healthful portion of 
chicken salad. His class today is on the 
Doctt ine and Covenants, the revelations 
given through Joseph Smith during his 
life. Smith was the Church's founding 
prophet, called by God to restore the 
Gospel to earth in its fn11ness. 

Brother Weber's assistant Valerie 
Ramos has just gotten off the phone 
with the mother of a high school senior 
who has a rule for her daughter that 
every college she applies to must have 
an Institute program. Valerie, wearing 
slacks and a sr nart periwinkle cardigan, 
has been with the Institute since her 
husband began the Yale School of 
Medicine's Physician Associate progra••• 
more than a year ago. They have no 
children. ''Not yet," adds a woman 
parking a stroller beside us. Some rime 
after my visit, Valerie wiiJ announce she 
is expecting a child in the fall. 

In the meantime, two women here 
are pregnant, so Bailey, the baby in 
the stroller, will soon have playmates 
anyway. In addition to the hundred-odd 
undergraduates in the congregation, 
there are about thirty LDS graduate 
students or residents at Yale, and many 
of them are married and have families, 
according to Brother Weber. In raising 
their children while pursuing advanced 
degrees, they've chosen . a difficult path, 
but a sweet one as well. 

Soon we are all seated and eating 
at the four round tables covered with 
wine-colored plastic tablecloths. We are 
discussing the story of Martin Harris. 
As you know, in 1828 the prophet had 
translated the first 116 pages of the Book 
of Mormon, and he entrusted the work 
he had completed so far to Harris 
after 
the Lord had acquiesced to this through 
the prophet. That portion of the Book 
was called the Book of Lehi, and it was 
. 
lost. The pages fell into the hands of 
. . . 
wicked men who were trying to stop the 
work of the Lord. 

Bailey, sitting in her mother's lap, 
is talking quiedy to herself. She begins 
to cry, and her mother carries her away 
as we go. on. talking about Harris. We're 
going on ''~ Scripture chase," Brother 
Weber announces. Turn to section 
111, verse eight of the Doctrine and 
Covenants. A husband and wife are 
following along on one of those fancy 
smartphones with a touch screen. She 
turns the phone sideways to make the 
words of Scripture easier to read: 
"The place wher~ it is my will that 
you should tarry, for the main, shall be 
signalized unto you by the peace and 
power of my Spirit, that shall flow unto 
you." When the Book of Lehi was lost, 
· Joseph Smith also lost his gift of being 
able to . translate the Scripture, and he 
was in despair. The peace of the Lord 
was lost to him, explains Brother Weber. 

· Brother Weber is a tall man with a 
shaven head, a smiling face, and intense 
. eyes. He spent most of his life out west, 
in San Diego and Seattle. There are far 
more members of the Church in that part 
of the country. "The culture here is not 
as familiar with Mormon philosophy and 
practice, and that's fair," he says later. He 
is a carpenter and a general contractor 
. by trade, and for two summers his 
camng was to work on the rebuilding of 
the first temple in Nauvoo, Illinois. His 
hardhat and a few of his grandfather's 
carpentering tools rest on a shelf in his 
office. Brother Weber has five sons 
the 
sixth died in a car accident-and twelve 
grandchildren and counting. 

He is directing our reflections to 
one passage from Scripture and then to 
another. Bailey can be heard bo1mcing a 
ping-pong ball on the floor in a comer 
of the room as we turn to the words 
of Paul in 1 Corinthians. Many people 
think the Church of Jesus Christ does 
not read the Bible, but its members 
indeed acknowledge the Old and New 
Testaments as the word of the Lord. See 
that painting on the far wall? The white-
robed figure among other figures on the 
stone steps of a fountain? It depicts an 
episode from the Gospel of John. 

Of course, other paintings in this 
building tell stories from th~ Book of 
Mormon. One on the first floor shows 
the white-robed figure among a group 
of people in garb resembling that of 
the American Indians. The man in white 
shows the wounds in his hands to the 
people surrounding him, who smile and 
weep. They are members of a tribe of 
Hebrews in North America to whom 
Jesus appeared after His resurrection.-
they had journeyed there from Canaan 
centuries earlier. 

Unfortunately, it's getting time· for 
us to wrap up. The prophet lost that 
peace of the Lord for a time along with 
his gift. But his gift and his peace were 
restored to him, and in spite of the loss 
of those 116 pages, the work of the 
Lord could not be stopped. "The Book 
of Lehi is gone," says Brother Weber. 
"We don't need the Book of Lehi. That 
book in front of you starts with Nephi, 
and that's where the Lord knew it would 
start." To accept that, you really have to 
have faith. 

All right, let's get a closing prayer. 
Will someone say it for us?
