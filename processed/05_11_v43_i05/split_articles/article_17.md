Opposite page: For the past few years, Yale has formed committees to address the problem of sexual misconduct on campus.  Those who understand it, are highlighting two aspects of Yale life that violate Title IX: inadequate response to many incidents where groups of men disparage women in public with chants such as "No means yes, and yes means anal" or by stealing the T-shirts created by victims of sexual assault for Take Back the Night; and a disciplinary system that does not appear to take sexual assault seriously enough.


As for the first problem, I understand the frustrations administrators must feel as they try to regulate the activities of drunk young men taking advantage of the tolerant cocoon university life deliberately provides. Nevertheless, it is clear from the reactions to these incidents that many people think that given the great privilege of a Yale education, a little sexual harassment by frat boys in the evening is not something to make into a federal case. In 1977, we, too, were told that the occasional proposition or grope or rape was something we should simply learn to handle. Now the general public has come to agree that sexual harassment is not to be tolerated, and Yale no longer belittles victims' concerns.


But it does not seem to want to take them seriously either: It often cites a free speech argument in defense of the status quo, claiming that it would not be possible to punish the dirty mouths on campus without risking greater harms. I am not convinced by this. Yale's own policies impinge on free speech rights in this very area. Students being disciplined for sexual harassment before the Executive Committee must stay silent; whatever incident gave rise to the charge effectively disappears from the newspapers and campus dialogue. No one really knows: who are the perpetrators, who are the victims, how frequent and how serious are their crimes?


As it did in the 1970s, Yale still keeps disciplinary issues fiercely in-house. It counts sexual assaults by Yale students against other Yale students, in buildings where no one but Yale students live, apartment buildings as well as frat houses, as exempt from Clery Act reporting because they are "off campus." Yale's disciplinary and counseling systems encourage women victims of sexual assault to pursue their cases internally. Private resolution saves the University lots of bad press. Confidentiality may have advantages for many women, but for others, living on the same campus as their assailants, who are punished lightly if at all, can be distressing and traumatizing.


Change is often slow, and inertia is powerful. But more can be done. I am encouraged by the announcement of the University Wide Committee, which furthers the Alexander v. Yale plaintiffs' decades-old goal of a single, campus-wide reporting system for sexual misconduct. Hopefully, this Title IX complaint will accelerate the speed and expand the scope of such action. One potential approach could be a major report on the status of women and the state of sexual harassment drawn up not only by Yale students and staff but also outside experts and observers not dependent upon Yale for promotion. These outsiders could also form the backbone of a standing committee on equality issues, meeting regularly and reporting in public annually, able to hold up a mirror to Yale to test whether its actions are meeting its intentions.


Yale College Dean Mary Miller wrote in her recent email to the Yale community: "I can also say that what I have heard about the substance of the complaint does not reflect the Yale that I know." I am sure she is sincere. I think the project at hand is fundamentally an educational one, as it was in 1977, to encourage people to reexamine their assumptions, so they see the evidence around them in a different light. I have had two daughters go through Yale, and we have hired dozens of Yalies as legal assistants for our law firm. I regret to say that the complaint does reflect the Yale many of them have known. On the Juicy Campus Web site several years ago, a man who said he was in my older daughter's college discussed in detail how he planned to rape her, and another commenter compared the "fuckability" of my two daughters. Yale did not defend Juicy Campus, but like the excrement I received in the mail, these anonymous comments were symptoms of the large and complex problem the school still faces from misogyny. It is a problem, one that seriously affects the lives of Yale women and men.


Yale remains one of the best places in the world to get an education and to grow as a person. I am grateful to it, and so are my daughters. But Yale can get better. The University should embrace the complaint as an opportunity to become a pioneer for preventative programming and resources. Yale has the opportunity to be a model of transformation. As it does in many other areas, Yale should aim to lead.
