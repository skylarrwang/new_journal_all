long 
mid-morning 
class 
period, which lasts from 10:05 
to 11:35, can be tedious if you're 
a student at Wilbur Cross, a public high 
school in New Haven. On a rainy day in 
early April, class was especially tedious 
for one st:Udent, whom I will call Shawn. 
He was working in the school library's 
computer room with his junior English 
classmates, and he was supposed to be 
researching a presentation on ''Battle 
Royal," the first chapter of Ralph 
Emson's 1952 novel, Invisible Man. 
It was a long period, the day was 
dreary, and Shawn hadn't done the

reading. Worse, his teacher, Michael 
Robin, was pushing him awfully hard, 
even though few others seemed to 
have done the reading either, and even 
though Shawn was one of five students 
in a class of eleven to have arrived in the 
classroom before the late bell rang. As 
the class period began, Robin explained 
that he wanted students to fill in gridded 
worksheets . with information about the 
story's author, quotations from the text, 
and their own analysis. 

By 10:38, the students had settled 
in the library with their Web browsers 
open. A few minutes earlier, Robin's goal 
for the class had dropped to recording 
and analyzing four quotations apiece, 
but even that much seemed insufferably 
boring to Shawn. He copied and pasted 
the story he was reading from a Web · 
. site to a Word document, fiddling with 
the font. By 11:22, Robin was begging 
Shawn to find just two quotations, but 
Shawn was still reluctant. 

By 11 :30, having tried every trick he 
could muster, having been called a racist 
by Shawn, who is black, Robin, who is 
white, settled on a pep talk. 'cy ou're way 
too talented to just blow it off," he told 
Shawn. Dropping to his knees beside 
Shawn's chair, he asked Shawn to spend 
two minutes finding just one quotation. 
"Can you do that?" 

In the end, Shawn threw up his 
hands, saying impassively to his friend 
beside him that he didn't care. It didn't 
matter. After class, his mood was 
markedly low, quiet. Shouldering his 
backpack, he told me he wasn't on his 
A-game. 

While Shawn left the library as 
quickly as he could, I asked his classmates 
whether they had ever heard of 
something called New Haven Promise. 
Yes, they had. But they didn't think that 
many people they knew would actually 
qualify for the scholarship program, 
which will begin this September to fund 
tuition at any in-state public university 
for graduates of 
ew Raven's high 
schools who meet its requirements for 
good behavior, academics, and residmcy 
in 
ew Haven. Most people, they told 
me, weren't focused on their grades-
only on passing enough classes to 
graduate high school. 

Students who spoke to me at four 
of New Raven's high schools said 
some of their classmates find it hard to 
understand why they should work at all 
in high school when they can't afford 
college anyway. "Some of these kids 
are slipping," said Diana Hernandez-
Degroat, a guidance counselor at High 
School in the Community. "The cost 
of college, some of them think it's too 
expensive and they can't go." Those 
behind New Haven Promise plan to 
change this. They have stated a goal to 
halve New Raven's high school dropout 
rate in five years by allowing all students 
to think of college as a possibility. 

Any student who lives in New 
Haven and attends one of the city's 
public schools is eligible to receive 
Promise funds, scaled according to how 
long they've studied in-district 
and 
so long as they have an attendance rate 
of 90 percent, complete forty hours 
of community service, and maintain a 
3.0 GPA. The program wi11 be phased 
in gradually, with current high school 
seniors receiving 25 percent of tuition 
and current freshmen, 100 percent. (It 
will take into account current seniors' 
senior-year GPA only and only the hours 
of community service they've completed 
since 
last 
fall.) 

The 
Community 
Foundation for Greater New Haven has 
taken on the program's operation from a 
small office with a handful of staff and 
a busy whiteboard, and Yale University 
will guarantee the scholarship's funding 
for four classes of students, for up to 
four mi11ion dollars each year, after 
which the program will be reviewed 

The program aims not only to provide 
students with college funding, but also 
to revitalize the city's economy. 

The greatest hope for Promise is 
that it will create a college-going culture 
in New Raven's schools, explained 
Emily Byrne, the program's director. She 
believes that the program's requirements 
will incentivize students to stay in school 
and sr 1 ive for a B average. ''We're like the 
golden carrot for these kids," she said. 

In the field of education, creating 
incentives 
can be 
tricky. 
Recently, 
Harvard economist Roland Fryer tested 
• what happens when children are paid 
to learn. When Fryer's team paid Dallas 
second graders two dollars for each book 
they read, students read many more 
books, and their reading comprehension 
scores increased measurably when tested. 

In New York and Chicago, however, 
where Fryer's team told students they'd 
pay them for good grades or test 
scores, students didn't do any better on 
standardized tests (though their grades 
did go up becau.se they attended class 
more regularly). 

· "If students lack the structural 
resources or knowledge to convert 
effort to measurable achievement," 
the 
study 
concluded, "or if 
the . 
production 
function 
has 
important 
complementarities out of their control 
(effective teachers, engaged parents, or 
peer dynamics, e.g.) then incentives will 
have very litcle impact." 

If you're a student at one of New 
Haven's public high schools, you might 
be able to rise to the challenge set by 
New Haven Promise, but you might not. 
Even if earning Promise funds seems an 
attractive enough incentive to tug you 
through 13 years of schooling, you'll still 
· need to be helped along the way. 

It was hard for me to tell what 
exactly made Shawn so resistant to work 
that April morning. Similarly, what it will 
take to create a true college-going culture 
in New Haven is a riddle 
the one that 
those behind New Haven Promise hope 
to solve. As its first students to benefit 
from Promise prepare to go off to 
college this fall, New Haven is poised to 
test their answer. 

'' 
WILL 
BE 
THE 
MOST 
SIGNIFICANT 
ANNOUNCEMENT EVER MADE 
IN NEW HAVEN," ·wrote Jessica 
Mayorga, then New Haven's director 
of communications, in a press r~lease 
before the program was announced last 
November. 

'Who's that district that people 
look to, to be a model? We think that · 
it's New Haven," Byrne told me. ''With 
32 
this program, with Promise added to 
. it, it becomes a beautiful example of 
what education reform can be." She 
. . 
. 
referred to School Change, the package . 
of reforms rolled out by Mayor John 
DeStefano, Jr. in February 2009. 


**Title: New Haven Promise and School Change**
**Page number(s): 32-33**

mayor has repeatedly stated a goal to 
make New Haven the nation's best urban 
school district 
a tall order, given that 
the city's public schools have long rested 
at the bottom of the achievement gap 
between rich and poor school districts i..~ 
Connecticut, which has the widest such 
gap of any state. The state's neighbors-
New York, Massachusetts, and Rhode 
Island 
all won funds in 2010 from the 
federal Race to the Top initiative, but 
Connecticut was not even a finalist. 

This is where the district stands. 
89 percent of its tenth-graders scored 
below the goal level in Science on the 
Connecticut Academic Performance Te.st 
in 2009, with only 6 percent of school 
districts statewide scoring the same or 
worse. 83 percent of a representative 
group of New Haven students qnaHfy 
for 
free or reduced-price lunches, 
compared to 30 percent statewide. (The 
percentage of students eligible for free 
or reduced-price lunches is often used 
as an indicator of economic need in a 
district.) New Haven's schools have a 
dropout rate of 27.5 percent, meaning 
that of all the freshmen who matriculate 
at one of the city's high schools, about a 
quarter won't graduate. 

It was 
as 
he was 
beginning 
his 
campaign for reelection to an 
unprecedented 
ninth 
term 
that 
DeStefano, who sent his own soris to 
Wilbur Cross, first described what's 
become his signature education reform 
initiative. New Haven Promise is only 
one aspect of School Change, which 
also includes strategies for ranking 
schools into tiers, evaluating teachers 
administrators, 
engaging 
parents and members of the community 
education 
reform. 

DeStefano's 
administration succeeded in reaching 
a new, reform-n•inded labor contract 
with the teachers' union in 2009 
a 
victory when in other districts across the 
country, and famously in Washington, 
D.C., disagreement between teachers' 
unions and cities has caused standstill in 
· reform efforts. 

"New Haven Promise, to me, could 
really only be a meaningful and optimal 
program if it occurred in the context 
of a set of investtnents, efforts, and 
energy," DeStefano told me at his office. 
Wherl. 'the success of Promise is brought

succeed without the other. 

For now, before -anything has been 
reviewed, proponents of School Change 
and Promise are hopeful "There's no 
question that we are a national example 
right now," said Garth Harries '96, 
assistant superintendent for portfolio 
and performance management and a 
recent hire to New Haven. "In many 
ways, we think we are leading the state, 
and leading the country." 

This is not the first time in its 
history that the leaders of New Haven 
have considered their city a model for 
the nation. In the 1960s, Mayor Richard 
Lee wanted to rejuvenate a city that 
was stuck after the war with decreased 
industr ia1 production and no place to 
put its newly swollen population, many 
of them blacks recently arrived from the 
South, seeking work. Lee's projects to

**Title: The Education Project**

n Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday 
afternoons, sunlight falls in long 
rectangles onto an array of music 
stands, two grand pianos, and a smooth 
hardwood floor in the recital room 
at the Neighborhood Music School 
on Audubon Street. The space comes 
alive when students spill in. Having 
completed the half-days they spend at 
various public high schools in the New 
Haven area, they assemble for meetings 
of a class called The Education Project. 
It's the most recent in a string of classes 
on social justice theater taught at the 
Educational Center for the Arts, a half-
day arts magnet school. The class, led by 
Peter Loffredo, a' teacher at ECA for 14 
years, teaches students to use hip-hop 
theater to examine education. Over the 
course of the setnester, they create and 
perforn1 a full-length play on the theme. 

Loffredo 
taught 
other 
classes on soc~ justice theater, with 
themes ranging from hepatitis C to 
homelessness, but he's never seen a topic 
provoke more passion in students than 
this one. 

~'They're more enthusiastic 
about this because it speaks to their 
immediate needs and issues that they're 
facing on a daily basis," he told me, 
leaning on one of the pianos. Loffredo 
is an energetic man with a booming 
voice, a graying beard, and a guffawing 
laugh. To his students, he is Peter. When 
they call him Mr. Loffredo, he likes to

shout theatrically, ''Did r ••y father come 
in here?" 

"They see the flaws in the structure," 
Loffredo said, serious now as he told me 
what his students have said to him about 
uninspired teaching, shoddy classroom 
environments, and failing figures of 
authority. ''They may not be able to do 
it in schools, but they want to call the 
system on depriving them . . And they get 
frustrated when they can't." 

Loffredo and ECA have provided a 
place where they can. When I visited in 
early spring, the class had compiled an 
initial draft of their play, and they were 
at work revising it. They began class 
by clustering their chairs in a circle and 
reading aloud an outline of the sea ipt 
they'd composed jointly. Bullet points 
represented scenes, groups of scenes, or 
monologues in the fon •• of raps. Bolded 
phrases were to-dos for the session.
