Du_ring violent protests, visiting expatriate 
parents at their home in Bahrain. 
' 
y father wrote me an email from 
u:ru·n on February 11, a month 
before I visited him and my mother there 
over spring break. ''We hear the honking 
of cars from the road in the distance in 
celebration of Mubarak's resignation," 
he wrote. "If things go well, this will be 
a step forward for the Arab world." A 
few days later, on February 14, I read in 
the New York Times that the violence 
had spread to Bahrain. To oversimplify 
the conflict, the majority of Bahrain's 
population is Shiite, but the· monarchy 
is Sunni. Primarily Shiite protestors 
were demanding greater political and 
economic freedoms. 

Pearl Square quickly became the 
meeting point of the protestors. "Pearl" 
refers to a monument in the area 
a 
white concrete orb held up by six curved 
pillars that commemorates the country's 
pearl-diving history. Pearl "Square" is 
a creation of the international media, 
an allusion to Egypt's Tahrir Square. 
I've always known this area as Pearl 
Roundabout or Lulu Roundabout, after 
the name of the nearby supermarket. 
Pearl Square is most definitely a circle. 
When I'm in Bahrain, I go around it 
just about every day, and every single 
time, my mom says, ''Be careful dt iving 
through roundabouts. Some drivers just 
don't know how to keep turning to stay 
inside their lane." 

In the early hours of Febn1ary 17, 
police fired tear gas and rubber bullets 
-
at the masses in Pearl Roundabout. 
Whole families had camped out there:-
some with young children 
and man 
were asleep when the crackdown began.

Paramedics responding to . the scene 
were targeted. At the end of the next 
day, hundreds were injured. In the first 
five days of demonstrations, seven 
protestors were killed. On February 19, 
the Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad al-
Khalifa ordered the withdrawal of forces 
from Pearl Roundabout, giving it to the 
protestors as a place of demonstration. 
A national tragedy had occurred, but it 
appeared to be over. Pearl Roundabout 
had become a new symbol 
one of 
popular revolt. 

In the month of peaceful protests 
following the initial violence, I wasn't so 
worried as I followed events from New 
Haven. Sleepy little Bahrain, making 
headline news. Nicholas Kristof filing 
editorials from the house of my parents' 
neighbors. I looked at as many photos 
of the protests as I could find, trying to 
identify the buildings in the background 
that I knew from my visits. 

am an expatriate because of my father, 
who works in international finance. 
My father is an expatriate by choice. 
As a young lawyer in New York, 
my father began trading textiles. One 
of my early memories of Manhattan 
is of a carpet store. Carpets were hung 
on the walls, rolled up along the sides 
of the room, piled several layers deep 
on the floor. Dust spiraled ·in the shafts 
of sunlight, disturbed as carpets were 
unrolled for display. As my parents 
examined the rugs, my older sister and 
I jumped between the stacks and hid in 
corners, engulfed in the mu ty smelL 
Born and raised in 
orth Carolina, 
my father had never known anything like 
the textile-trading world. Maybe that's 
what attracted him to it. At first, he could 
not afford to buy carpets, but he still went 
to the stores and talked to their owners . 
He learned how to distinguish between 
the carpets of different tribes 
Soumac, 
Belouch, Konya. He heard about the 
cities where textile traders bought their 
stock Istanbul, Lahore, Tehran. 

By the time he visited those cities 
for himself, years later, he had the 
knowledge of a professional. In the 
Grand Bazaar in Istanbul, my blond-
haired and blue-eyed father looked like 
the perfect target for carpet dealers who 
wanted to sell him new, chemically dyed,· 
Persian designs. They harassed him as he 
walked by. He would turn around and 
say, "Unless you have an antique Shirvan 
or Suzani, I'm not interested." They left 
him alone after that. 

Now, my father owns around fifty 
carpets, though he trades them regularly. 
Some were bought in New York. More 
were bought in Singapore, where we 
lived after New York. A few were bought 
during travels in Turkey, Pakistan, Iran, 
Uzbekistan. 

He often stands in the living room, 
staring at a carpet he has recently 
unrolled. If I walk by, he will ask my 
opinion of it. He thinks I have an "eye 
for color." I pause for a minute, loolcing 
thoughtful. Actua11y, I'm staring without 
thinking, waiting until I can get away. I 
say something neutral. I just don't care 
about the carpets. To me, they all look 
about the same. 

I wish I could appreciate therra the 
way my father does. Each one of the 
seven houses where I have lived has 
had carpets on the floor in New York, 
Singapore, and now Bahrain. But I've 
never been able to shake off the idea 
that home should be a fixed point on a 
map. 

ivfy father often reminds me that 
Bahrain is my home. It's not. I've never 
actna11y lived there 
I left for college 
at the same time my parents moved to 
Bahrain. During school vacations, it's 
where I "go home.n But it's not my 
home.

eing an expatriate means being 
ready to move to a new country 
without much warning. In the expatriate 
world, it is an anomaly that I lived in 
Singapore for eleven years. My father 
passed on opportunities to relocate so 
I could complete school in Singapore. 
When I finished high school, though, 
my parents were free to leave. Within a 
few weeks of graduation, years of life irt 
Southeast Asia were packed, given away, 
or discarded. 

My mother and I flew to Bahrain 
for the first time that summer. My father 
already had been living there for six 
months. He picked us up at the airport 
and wanted to immediately take us the 
ruins of a seventeenth-century Persian 
fort. I convinced him to let me sleep 
instead. 

I went to a mall a few days after 
arriving 
beautiful 
mall, 
more 
sophisticated than any I've seen in the 
States, with Saks Fifth Avenue and every 
European · designer store. Manhattan, 
Singapore, Bahrain: all tiny islands, all 
meeting points. Some women dressed 
in ·curtain-like black abayat and face-
covering niqab. Since even their feet 
were covered, they seemed to glide over 
the marble floor. Others pranced around 
in skin-tight distressed jeans. My mother 
left me for a few minutes to do errands, 
and I was alone among strangers. 

I had already traveled a lot in 
the Middle East, in Egypt and in 
Jordan. There was nothing naturally 
shocking or intimidating about my 
surroundings at the mall. But alone in 
this new country 
a country that had 
44 
just become a part of my life · I was 
suddenly and irrationally overcome with 
fear. I felt self-conscious in my baggiest 
jeans and most .formless shirt, like every 
man weat:ing a white robe and headscarf 
. was stadng at my body. I sat paralyzed 
inside a Starbucks, apprehensive of the 
men with Cartier watches and women 
with Bv~gari jewelry, desperate for my 
mother to return. 

That first . trip to Bahrain, my

mother and I took a taxi to the mall 
once a . day to buy groceries. Otherwise, 
. we stayed in the temporary apartment 
where my father had been living. He 
took the car to work every morning. 
Bahrain has no public transportation, 
and taxis are prohibitively expensive, 
so we tried to avoid taking them more 
thari was necessary. I worked out in the 
aparttnent gym. Its only other users were 
U.S. servicemen from the Navy's Fifth 
Fleet, stationed a few minutes away by 
car. I · watched television. Bahraini TV 
airs a lot of American shows. I read a 
couple of books 
one about Jakarta, 
which 
brought 
back 
memories 
of 
living 
in 
Singapore. 
I 
thought 
about 
my 
friends 
Singapore, 
hanging out at the 
American 
Club, 
a facility with a 
pool, gym, lihtary, 
and 
restaurants 
where we all had 
spent a lot of

time groWing up. Now' tliat we were all 
finally eighteen years old, my friends 
would be going to the bar there. 

n Bahrain, my mom and I looked for 
a house. My father had brought a few 
small carpets to put on the floor of the 
temporary apartment, but it still smelled 
like plastic. While he was at work, the 
real estate agent picked up my mother 
and me in his car. We drove all over the 
island, visiting house after house. My 
parents wanted a house with·"character." 
Because there would only be the two of . 
them living there, my mother wanted a 
house that would be manageable to take 
care of by herself. Instead, the real estate 
agent showed us huge, marble palaces 
with gilded iron gates. McMansions, my 
m?m called them. They are built primarily 
fot wealthy expatriates and Arabs; often 
clustered in gated communities. During 
my first visit, we did 'not find a single 
place my parents wanted to live. 

Those neighborhoods of opulent 
houses 
with smaller exterior buildings 
where the domestic workers and drivers 
who work at the bouse live 
are the ones 
I think of as typical in Bahrain. But this 
"typical" is coming from the perspective 
of a Westerner with a sheltered life 
there.· My "typical" is not accurate. 
There are outlying Bahraini villages I've 
never visited. There are neighborhoods 
of migrant workers who have left their 
home countries and send money back 
to their families. Filipinos work in the 
service industry; South Asians work 
in construction. The presence of so 
rnariy migrant workers made me feel 
comfortable during those first few weeks 
in Bahrain. I was accustomed to seeing 
people from diose places in Singapore. 

I did not embrace Bahrain. My . 
father did. This t nanifested itself in a 
suqden and passionate love for eating 
dates. He had hated dates when he was 
younger, but according to him,. that was 
because they lost their flavor traveling 
long distances. Dates in Bahrain were 
fresh-that is to say, freshly dried. Every 
time anyone asked, "What's Bahrain 
like?" he would mention dates. Every 
night after dinner, I would hear, "Helen! 
THE NEw JouRNAL

The writer (second from right) and her family at the Shaikh Isa bin Ali House in Muharraq, Bahrain . 
Have a date." I hated dates. Truthfully, I 
was indifferent to the taste. But willingly 
eating them seemed something like 
gtvmg m. 

Flights often leave Bahrain in the 
middle of the night. My father complains 
about driving to the aitport at that hour, 
but he does it anyway. Normally, I say 
goodbye to my parents at the terminal's 
security checkpoint before Immigration. 
Then, when I'm leaving with my sister, 
we start singing, "Freedom... Freee-
doooom." We are only half kidding. 

y parents finally found a house 
_ct,Ll.rlng my first semester in college. 
They moved in on Thanksgiving Day, 
which I spent with far nily in Boston. 
The house across the street had a 
Sri Lankan maid narned Rani who, by 
tradition, also worked in the house we 
had rented. My tnother decided this 
arrangement would continue. One of 
the first questions Rani asked my mother 
was, "Do you like cats?" She was relieved 
when my mother said no. The previous 
tenants not only had several cats of their 
own, but they also fed all of the stray 
and pet cats in the neighborhood. Every 
evening, around fifty cats would stream 
to the house for food. The house had to 
be renovated before we moved in, in part 
because the cat smell was unbearable. 

Our house is in what would be 
called a gated community in the States, 
although the term "compound" is still 
used in Bahrain. The houses in the 
community are all white and one· or two 
stories ta11. There is a tennis court and a 
pool. The compound is literally an oasis, 
built over a natural water source that still 
springs up in a pool today. As a result 
of the fresh water, it is exceptionally 
verdant, with luxurious bougainvillea 
bushes and overgrown hedges spming 
over garden fences. Massive date paln1s 
line the streets. They are tended by a 
crew of quiet Nepalese gardeners, who 
collect thousands of green dates from 
the trees every spring. 

Over the course of visits to Bahrain 
during school vacations, I got to know 
some of the people in the community. 
Because the houses are only for lease and 
not for sale, most are expat• iates. Grace, 
an elegant Asian-American woman from 
Colorado, is one of my favorites. She 
helped me with rtty Chinese homework 
over winter break. Her husband owned 
his own business in Colorado, but he lost 
it in the recent financial crisis. The only 
work he could find was in Bahrain, so 
they sold their house and moved. 

During my visits there, I usnaJ1y did 
very little, relishing in the kind of luxury 
that only arises during a school vacation. 
I stayed up too late at night, watching 
DVDs on my laptop, sometimes until 
the sunrise call to prayer was broadcasted 
from a dozen mosques nearby. During 
the day, I padded around the dark and 
cool house in my pajamas, the bottoms 
of my bare feet cushioned by the carpets 
in every room. My favorite carpet, fleecy 
soft with a blue and red geometrical 
design, was in a smaller room off the 
living room with enormous bookshelves. 
I set ambitious goals for reading books 
and failed to meet them. When my 
father was in the house, music would be 
playing 
classical, jazz, contemporary 
Algerian, or something else. Sometim~ 
m y mother, sister, and I would go to 
the pool or the movie theater. 
was about it Bahrain is a quiet placee-
nothing ever happens there. 

n Bahrain, as in other Middle Eastern 
countries, people often say · 
It

prayer beads through one's bands even 
when one is not actna11y praying. Initially~
