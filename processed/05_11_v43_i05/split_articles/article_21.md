against a brick wall or a fence while 
Rocky peers around the corner ahead. 
Once he has determined that the coast is 
clear, he motions to us to move along. At 
the corner outside the Chinese takeout 
restaurant my roommates frequent, he 
invites me to look around with him-
. 

after he's done the preliminary check, 
of course. He points to a stoop under 
a yellow restaurant awning about thirty 
feet away. 

''We'd look in places like that," he 
says. To Rocky's trained eye, any activity 
in side alleys, in slightly hidden stoops, 
or behind dumpsters is an immediate red 
Bag. He tells me he simply strolls up to 
the suspicious person and suggests they 
move out. If a drug dealer or a prostitute 
or an addict has been spotted, he or she 
is likely to want to move on wimngly, he

explains. 
I look hard into the shrouded 
corners of each alleyway we pass, willing 
my eyes to see what Rocky sees, but 
I'm getting nothing. I stick to watching 
Rocky's massive shoulders lumber in 
front of me. 
Rocky and Taxi split up the group, 
sending Ninja, Tank, and Cisco one 
block ahead of us while we follow. 
Splitting the formation, they explain, will 
ensure that if the other three patrollers' 

presence sttrs up any acttvlty or nervous 
responses, our half of the patrol can 
follow up in their rear. But on a quiet 
night like this one, Ninja, Tank, and 
Cisco seem to be strolling casually ahead 
of us, leaving me to chat with Rocky 
and Taxi. As we walk, Rocky makes eye 
contact with almost everyone we pass~­espedally 
the 
occasional 
homeless 
person slouched against a building. Eye 
contact is part of the mission. Rocky 
wants the patrollers' red jackets to 
become a familiar, comforting presence. 
Rocky says patrols like this 
with a lot 
of walking and very little action 
are 
part of the job. Too often he's seen 
young men who join expecting a fight 
every night grow disappointed when 
they discover the job is usually quiet. 
Still, he reminds me to stay on the inside 
of the group. 
&~f something happens, you need 
to be able to get back so we can protect 
you," he says. 
Rocky, like all· the Guardian Angels, 
goes by a nickname. The true identities 
of the Angels must remain private, he 
tells me, because of the work they do. 
They are the eyes and ears and arms 
of neighborhoods all over the world-
and dn1g dealers and gang members 
can never be allowed to know their 
real names. On the ·street and even at 
the headquarters, they all address one 
another by nicknames, and that is how I 
will refer to them here. 
spent four nights patrolling the 
ew Haven streets with the cit:fs

nonprofit vol1inteer safety patrol that 
fights Clime unanued. The Guardian 


Angels' red berets and jackets have been 
seen around the city since 2007, when 
they first set up a chapter in New Haven. 
It was the Hassidic Jewish population in 
the Edgewood community that called 
in the Angels. Violence had escalated to 
the point that community leaders had 
begun arming themselves, ready to take 
the situation into their own hands. When 
Curtis Sliwa, the founder of the original 
Guardian Angels 
chapter in 
New 
York, swept into town at the request 
of Edgewood rabbis, the New Haven 
chapter was born. He appointed leaders 
from other Connecticut chapters to 
help develop the New Haven group and 
collaborate with the Jewish community 
for its protection. The results are clear. 
Rocky reports that the Edgewood 
neighborhood has seen a sixty percent

reduction in crime since 2007. 
Today the New Haven chapter of 
the Angels is one of 143 across fifteen 
countries. Originally founded in 1979 in 
New Yo~ the Angels have gained an 
international reputation for _wallcing the 
line between s 
ero and vigilante.

apartment that acts as their headquarters 
to plan their route before heading out 
for patrol. The rooms are sparse and 
the building is old, but Rocky's "office" · 
has been arranged to look as official as 
possible. He speaks to me from behind 
a desk littered with flyers advertising the 
Angels. It's important to self-publicize, 
Rocky tells me, because they're still 
building up the chapter and he needs 
as many eyes on the streets with him as 
possible. 
It has proven difficult for Rocky 
to find people willing to give up their 
nights on a weekly basis to roam around 
the city preventing crime. Most Angels 
members' careers last only a few years, 
Rocky says, but lately the New Haven 
chapter has retained patrollers for longer 
periods of time. Still, the guys have 
their own jobs, Rocky tells me, and they · · 
want to spend their time off with their 
families, so doing more than one patrol a 
week can be difficult. 
The evenings spent out on the 
. . 
· cold streef corners of New Haven are · 
unpleasant at times, Rocky tells me, but 
they're worth it. Rocky keeps in mind · 
the famous Queens murder of Kitty 
Genovese in 1964, which took place 
only blocks from where he once lived. 
Genovese was stabbed repeatedly in the 
middle of the street, and as she cried 
out, begging for help, no one came to 
her rescue. No one called the police until 
it was much too late. When witnesses 
were asked later why they . did nothing, 
their response went down in history: "I 
didn't want to get involved." 
Rocky reminded me of this incident 
on more than one occasion, shaking 
his head with disbelief each time. That 
won't happen on his watch. 
Modern psychologists know the 
Kitty Genovese story well, because it 
illustrates the "bystander effect" 
idea that the more people there are 
watching a crime, the less likely it is 
that someone will stop the events from 
unfolding, because it's' . someone else's 
problem. But to the Angels, everyone 
else's problems are their problems. 
''They love us here," Rocky says. 
As he watches the streets, I can see 
-
his shoulders stiffen with pride. This 
fraternity of unarmed strangers has 
been welcomed, first into the Edgewood 
community, . and 
slowly 
block 
by 
into _New Haven, spotting the 
streets with their red berets. 

The Angels have 
gained a reputation · 
for walking the line 
between superhero 
and vigilante. This 
-· fraternity of 
unarmed strangers 
has been welcomed, 
first into the 
Edgewood 
community, and 
slowly block by 
into New 
Haven, spotting the 
streets with their red 
berets. 

n my second patrol with the Angels, 
I meet them at the headquarters, 
only a fifteen-minute walk away. "It's the 
X location," Rocky says of this building, 
explaining to me that I must be careful 
not to reveal where we are. He laughs. 
I can't tell how serious he's being, so I 
smile and write it down obediently. 
*** Street. X Location. 
Rocky is wming to let me come to a .. 
"bad neighborhood," but only if ·I make· 
an effort to blend in. I know he's referring 
to the bubblegum-pink notebook I tried 
~ 
to bring on our first patrol. He'd looked 
at it suspiciously and told me to find 
something less conspicuous. This time 
I've brought a slim black notebook that 
can fit in my pocket, and I'm wearing 
as bulky a jacket as I could find. I stuff 
my hair into a hat and zip up the jacket .. 
And this time, Ninja suggests I dress to 
match them. Over my enormous down 
jacket, I put on one of the Angels' bright 
red numbers, and I even get a beret. I 
know I look ridiculous. After a laugh, 
Ninja offers, c~t least you'll be warm." 
I waddle obediently to take my place 
in the middle of the group. This time, 
Tank is tasked with walking with me and 
~eeping me on the inside. 
Tank's son, Cisco, walks ahead of 
his father. He's still the new recruit, so 
Ninja has to supervise him. 
When we're posted up at a corner, I 
tty to talk to them both. 
"So you're the father-son team, 
huh?" 
Nods. 
c"What made you want to join -
your dad, Cisco?" I flash him my best 
attempt at a charming smile. At twenty-
something he's easily the youngest of the 
group, and he looks me up and down 
with obvious discomfort while the other 
men have only kindly, paternally smiled. 
ccHe saw a lot of what's going on in 
the streets and he was sick of it," Tank 
answers. "He's good 'cause he knows 
the streets and stuff, he knows what's 
. happenin' out there." 
ccHow do you know so much about 
it?" I direct my question to Cisco again. 
ccHe's seen it, he's been there," Tank 
responds. 

I give up. As I walk with Tank, he 
is happy to chat with me. Unlike his .. 
son, he's no sparse conversationalist. 
He praises Cisco, explaining to me that 
though his son stayed out of trouble, 
enough of his friends fell into gang 
culture that he knows the street calls 
of the major gangs and can spot telltale 
markers of gang activity that the others 
might overlook. Tank's not the first 
Angel- to brag to me about street smarts

eel used to be a bounty hunter," he 
shrugged, a cocky grip spreading over 
his face. 'cr did my stakeouts out of a

his affinity for rnartial arts as a child 
growing up . in public housing projects, 
also works as a p_art-time bounty hunter, 
hired out by local police forces in nearby 
Meriden. One night as we stood outside 
Dunkin' Donuts on a brief patrol break, 
he mm nbled that sometimes it's hard to 
be unarmed and to know that he can 
at most make a citizen's arrest 
when on 
patrol with the Angels. 
"What would you do if someone 

you were trytng to scare away JUSt came 
at you with a knife or a gun?" I asked. 
'Td have to walk away,'' he said, his 
features screwed up in a grimace. Ninja 
is a man who prefers to fight back. 
Tank raises his chin in fraternal 
greeting to everyone we pass with a 
gruff ''How you doin', guy?" A few 
people sto..p him, and they exchange 
a handshake o.r a hello. Some of the 
people we pass respond with a nod or a 
"Glad to see you're out here, man." 
Not everyone greets us warmly. 
We pass three teenagers gathered on a 
doorstep who avoid eye contact with 
MAY 2011 
Tank, only responding in grunts to his 
customary "How you doin'?" greeting. 
''I always try to say hello and how 
you doin'," Tank says. ''Even if they're 
not gonna respond. Those guys were 
gang members 
but at least I got their 
respect." 
I peer cautiously back behind me, 
looking for some telltale brands or 
marks on the boys. 
"How'd you know they're gang 
members?" I ask. 
''You 
could 
tell," 
Tank 
g• ins 
knowingly at me. ''They was definitely 
packin'." 
One tiny, 
elderly woman 
sees 
us moving in double formation (two 
vertical lines of three people each) 
and runs onto her porch. As she steps 
into her doorway, beckoning us over, 
a few people move shiftily out of the 
doorframe. 
"Can you do something about this?', 
she begs, gesturing to the people cotr•ing 
and going. ''They smokin' the crack pipe 
in the house all the rime, I got nenas and 
they little and the smoke's comin' under 
my door." 
Her English is rough and broken, 
and Tank, who is Puerto Rican, switches 
into Spanish. I join them on her doorstep 
and ask her in Spanish why the police 
haven't helped her. 
''I call the~ all the rime, every day," 
she tells me. "Nunca /Iegan, nunca 1/egardn." 
They never come, and they're never 
gomg to come. 
Tank promises her that he'll put in 
a call for her. As we walk away I ask him 
why he thinks he can get the cops to 
come if she's been ca11ing .repeatedly. He 
looks at me importantly. 
''Because the Guardian .Angels 
know now." 
I turn, craning my neck around 
Tank's broad shoulders and bulkv frame, 
watching the woman .retreat into her 
house. 
Weeks later, when I inquired with 
Rocky about the woman's status, he 
didn't know if the police had responded. 
On this second night, I can see the real
