In 1685, William Cooper gave an 
unusual gift. The po·or Hamden farmer 
uprooted two saplings, specimens of 
Ulmus Americana, the American elm ' 
from his farm and hauled them on his 
wagon five miles to the budding city of 
New Haven, where he planted them in 
front of the church that then stood on 
the town green. They were the first elms 
recorded to have been planted in the city.· 
Nearly three and a half centuries 
.later, the city of New Haven received 
· an eerily similar present. In 2009 and 
2010, Deborah Edwards and other 
members of the Garden Club of New 
Haven made two trips, presumably not 
by wagon, to · Hamden's Whitneyville 
United Church of Christ, where two 
venerable American elms stand. The · 
. . 
club members gathered up seeds and 
saplings from the trees and hastened 
them back to New Haven. 
But the Garden 
Club, whose 
members do civic horticultural work in 
New Haven, did not intend to donate 
them to a Puritan minister and his white 
clapboard chapel. The project that 
Edwards oversees, "American Elms in 
New Haven: On its Green and in its 
Neighborhoods," has as one of its goals 
another, perhaps higher, aspiration 
to 
restore the Elm City to at least some of 
its former glory. 

New Haven has had a long and 
tragic history with Ulmus americana. 
Late 
eighteenth-~entury 
enthusiasts 
oversaw the first systematic planting of 
elms on the Green. Shordy thereafter, 
James Hillhouse of Hillhouse Avenue 
fame 
packed the rest of the city with 
them. By the middle of the nineteenth 
century, New Haven resembled an 
exclusive, elms-preferred arboreal club. 
But trees are not pillars of stone. 
In 1838, an infestation of cankerworm 
caterpi11ars 
munched 
through New 
Haven's elm foliage. They continued 
to do so sporadically in the years that 
followed. Then, towards the end of 
the 1800s, elm bark beetles arrived 
in New Haven and began to eat their 
. way through the trees 
themselves. 

New Haven residents desperately tried 
surrounding the elms' lower trunks with 
moats of oil to prevent the wingless 
cankerworms from gaining access to 
branches. They later doused the trees 
with the highly toxic compound lead 
arsenate to ward off the beetles. 

Despite _these efforts, the elm 
population was shrinking. In 1930, the 
United States recorded its first case of 
Dutch elm disease, a fungus carried by 
beetles that is all but certain death to 
Ulmus americana. In the 1940s, the tree 
·disease struck New Haven, and within a 
few decades, ninety percent of the Elm 
City's eponymous trees were gone. 

This is where Edwards's work 
comes in, she told me. The elms at the 
Whitneyville 
Congregational Church 
evidently resisted the disease; the seeds 
gathered there are likely to be disease 
~esistant as well. So Edwards's project 
has distributed those seeds, along with 
some American elm seeds bought 
commercially and known to be resistant, 
to some of its members and to local 
schoolchildren. The members will raise 
the trees, 131 in all, in what Edwards 
called "foster care." Then, in 2013, when 
the trees are four- to five-foot saplings, 
they will be transplanted to various New 
Haven schools, nonprofi~and perhaps 
residential yards. If New Haven. is 
_ lucky which will become evident only 
after a few decades 
the elms will be 
resistant to Dutch elm disease and will 
grace the city for centuries to come. 

Edwards is not the only expert on 
New Raven's elms. When I requested 
literature on the topic at the New Haven 
' Historical Society's Whitney Library, 
THE NEW JouRNAL 


' 
· · the librariari peered at me knowingly 
through her thick spectacles and then 
buried me under piles of memorabilia 
about New Raven's long-dead trees; 
As the number of elms dwindled 
over the twentieth century, New Haven 
residents 
mourned 
their loss 
and 
memorialized their love for the trees. 
~ newspaper clipping from February 
5, 1972 lamented the loss of Hillhouse 
Avenue's last elm. A book by an early 
twentieth century resident, self-published 
. and inexplicably dedicated to William 
Howard Taft, criticized New Haven 
residents for their failure to take better 
care of their trees. A bound copy of a 
Yale term paper from 1986 argued that 
the Elm City's trees had suffered most 
from unnatural calamities, including 
"leaky gas mains" and the ill-tempered 
horses of ninteenth-century locals; who 
had a predilection for wreaking havoc on 
the trees' trunks. 

In a 2006 piece in the Yale Alumni 
Magazine, School of Forestry and 
Environmental 
Studies 
Professor 
Stephen Kellert speculated that we 
are drawn to Ulmus americana because 
it resembles the tree species of our 
primordial birthplace on the African 
savannah. Walking along the Green on 
a recent spring day, I tried to imagine it 
as it looked in_ the photographs that I 
came upon in the Whitney Library from 
the early twentieth century. If Edwards's 
. seedlings prove hardy, the gritty sidewalk 
will once again look elegant beneath the 
towering, gently fluted trees that gave 
the Elm City its name.
