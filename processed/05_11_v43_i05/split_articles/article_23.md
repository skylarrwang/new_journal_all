Connecticut is home to over fifty
different species of mosquitoes, thirty
of which at'e .commonly found in the
statewide traps. But one morning in July
2006, Shepard saw a distinct, uncommon
species under his mic£oscope. Silvery
white stripes lined the thorax and legs of
the black insect. Shepard had seen such
markings before and quickly identif1ed
the species as Aedes albopictus, the Asian
tiger mosquito, a carrier of numerous
deadly diseases. He checked the sample
container to see where the mosquito had
been trapped. He knew the place well.-
