for crying out loud, they're going to be 
shipping out the mosquitoes as well'," 
Reiter recalled. ''All of the tires had 
water in them and all of them had lots 
of mosquitoes." 
Reiter learned that the men's 
company also imported tires from Japan: 
''And that's how I stumbled on the fact 
that there's this incredible trade in used 
tires." 
The Japanese were exporting used 
tires to some 140 or 150 countries. 
The United States exported them 
to over a hundred countries. Tires 
were being shipped to the United 
States for recapping many countries 
have regulations that allow tires to 
be ·recapped or retreaded. Airplane 
tires can be recapped nine times, 
Reiter learned. And so a trade in what 
appeared to be useless used rubber was 
in fact a lucrative global industry. "The 
Europeans were importing them. I told 
them that they should not, but of course 
nobody stopped, and now Europe is 
full of albopictus. Oh, it's everywhere. It's 
in about four or five countries in West 
Africa. It's certainly in Lebanon and 
Syria. It's going to be universal, I think." 
its entrance into the . port of 
Houston, the Asian tiger stalked its 
way east and up the Atlantic seaboard. 
Today, the front line in the battle against 
the species lies somewhere along the 
Connecticut-New 
York-New 
Jersey 
border. At the Experiment Station in 
New Haven, Shepard and Andreadis are 
on high alert. 
When the two found the first 
in 
Connecticut in 
2006, 
they were not surprised. Andreadis 
guessed almost immediately how it

''There was no question it was 
by the transportation of used tires," 
he tells me. All mosquitoes collected 
in the surveiJlance program's traps 
identified and sorted by species 
~d trap location, and the Asian tiger 
mosquito that Shepard had identified 
was from a trap at the Exeter Energy 
Tue Incinerator. The only question 
that mattered was whether or not the 
mosquito would establish a permanent ·

To do so, the Asian tiger's eggs 
needed 
to last 
through 
the 
cold 
Connecticut winter. After the first 
Asian tiger was found at the Sterling tire 
plant, survei11ance staff returned to the 
facility weekly for the remainder of the 
season. They found that the mosquito 
had successfully entrenched itself in the 
woodlands surrounding the tire facility, 
and females were beginning to lay eggs in 
traps that Andreadis's team had placed. 
When they returned in early summer of 
2007, though, they found no larvae in 
the traps 
the eggs had died during the 
winter 
and no host-seeking females in 
the surrounding woodlands. 
The results of their study, which 
Andreadis published in a 2009 paper in 
the Journal of the American Mosquito 
Control 
Association, 
identified 
a 
temperature barrier. South of the barrier, 
where the average January temperature is 
above zero degrees Celsius, the mosquito 
had successfully established itself. In 
New York City, where the average 
January temperature is 0.14 degrees 
Celsius, albopictus resides in every major

borough. Other surveillance programs 
had found the species overwintering in 
New Jersey and Pennsylvania, but not 
north of the zero degree barrier. A line 
on a map to mark this barrier would rise 
through central Pennsylvania, stretch 
across northern New Jersey, and follow 
the eastern seaboard along the coast 
of the Long Island Sound out to sea. 
Average January temperatures all across 
Connecticut are just slightly below the · 
zero degree mark. 
According to Andreadis's paper, the 
Sterling tire recycling plant often receives 
tires from out of state. The Asian tiger 
likely arrived inside a tire on one of 
these shipments, probably from New 
Jersey. (Exeter Energy is undergoing an 
acquisition and declined to comment 
for this article.) Though the mosquitoes 
have so far failed to survive the winters 
here, average global temperatures are on 
the rise, and if Connecticut warms even 
slightly, we may well find the Asian tiger 
residing permanently in our backyards. 
John Shepard explained all of 
this to me in a sma11 closet at the end 
of a long hall on the -second floor of

the Slate laboratory building of the 
Connecticut Agricultural Experiment 
Station. An independent state agency, 
the Experiment Station is cramped onto 
a _small campus in the midst of the leafy 
residential Prospect Hill neighborhood 
just minutes north of Yale. All states have 
experiment stations, and Connecticut's is 
the oldest, founded in 1875. The station 
·conducts scientific research focusing 
on agriculture and the environment. A 
scientist fu:st bred hybrid corn here in 
1914. Since its founding, the station's 
motto has .been "Puu ing Science to 
Work for Society." 
Shepard brought me to this closet-
"insectary" is the preferred term 
after 
his colleague, Dr. Melissa Hardstone, 
came to tell him that she was "going to get 
the guinea pig." I asked what this meant, 
and Shepard led me into the cramped, 
fiuorescently lit, artificially humidified 
room. Here, the researchers keep live 
colonies of eight species of mosquito 
in wire-mesh cages 
including certain 
species not kept in colonies anywhere 
else in the country. 
At the . end of a shoulder-height 
shelf against th~ back wall, one of 
these cages contained a guinea pig with 
a shaved back. The white rodent was in 
its own wire cage, unable to move and 
subject to hundreds of Aedes aegypti 
mosquitoes. Its back was covered in 
small red bites. Hardstone insisted 
that the guinea pig doesn't mind the 
treat:Inent and, in fact, eagerly shuffles 
into its confining cage each time it is sent 
to be fed on. The feeding protocols, I 
~ 
was assured, are approved-by the United 
States Departtnent of Agriculture and 
the Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee. The guinea pigs are used 
only for the species of mosquitoes 
known to feed on rnammals. For others 
that prefer-birds, a sma11 button quail is 
used instead. 
On a 'lower shelf ·on .· the adjacent 
wall, another cage was clearly labeled 
Aedes albopictus. 'Ibis is one of the 
country's few colonies of the Asian tiger. 
These colonies are an important 
weapon in the arsenal of mosquito 
containment. Because the Experiment 
Station also has an enormous collection 
of live viruses and pathogens in a high-
safety laboratory, researchers can study 
these diseases and the way they spread 
through their insect vectors. 
When mosquitoes bite us, most of us 
are annoyed at the itch, but few are likely 
to worry about deadly tropical diseases. 
During the 1999 
est Nile 
outbreak, news 
coverage was 
around the clock. 
Trucks were 
spray1ng 
insecticide all 
over New York 
City. Calls were 
coming in daily 
to the station 
repo~ing dead 
birds crows 
were falling out 
of the sky. 
Shepard, because of his exposure to the 
myriad threats, tends to dwell on these 
more morbid possibilities. <'I know when 
my kids get bit it's probably nothing," 
Shepard told me. <'But I'm not in unune 
to worrying. And my wife will say to me, 
~e we safe here?"'

of the two main lab romus of

Vector Biology and Zoonotic Diseases

detail of the story of

The spread of West Nile through 
Culex pipiens tells us much about the 
potential dangers of the Asian tiger 
mosquito. 
Put simply, just as Culex 
pipiens was waiting and ready when West 
Nile arrived, so too may the Asian tiger 
be waiting and ready when Dengue 
arrives. And if the connection seems 
far-fetched, consider the fact that Culex 
pipiens made its continental leap on 
shipping vessels 
likely wooden saiJing 
ships that crossed to the Americas in the 
seventeenth or eighteenth century 
just 
as the Asian tiger snuck into Houston 
and now into Connecticut inside tires. 
For the scientists who work in 
this field, it is not a question of if but 
when. For now, our best weapon is 
good intelligence, for which we can 
thank the Experiment Station. The 
lessons it learned in dealing with the 
West Nile threat 
in ultimately failing 
to contain the virus, despite Anderson's 
breakthrough in successfully identifying 
it 
have · been 
institutionalized 
the form of the massive surveillance 
progra 111 and better communication with 
public health officials. <'It sounds terribly 
trite, but expect the unexpected," warns 
Reiter. "Who the heck knows what's 
going to come in next?" Though we 
will surely deal with another deadly 
mosquito-borne outbreak, we will be 
better prepared for the next epidemic, 
even if the disease finds a vector in the 
Asian tiger mosquito.
