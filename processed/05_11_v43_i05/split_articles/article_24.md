Andreadis, who oversees the surveillance 
program and has extensive training with 
mosquitoes, had seen the species before 
and was well aware of the threat caused 
by its growing global presence. 


Mosquitoes are picky eaters. Of 
all the species of the insect found in 
Connecticut, only a few are known to 
feed on humans. And.readis and the 
~ 
surveillance tea• n have analyzed the blood 
meals of mosquitoes and have isolated 
the species that .readily feed on humans. 
They vary according to geography 
but include Ochkrotatus sollicitans, Aetks 
vexans, Aetks japonitt~s, Culex pipiens, and, 
of course, Aedes albopictlls. Shepard

has extensive 
experience: a 
number of close-up pictures on the 
feature his hand being fed on by various 
mosqwtoes. 
The 
tiger, though, is different 
from the others. It feeds on anything 
that moves. In populated areas it is a 
serious human pest. ''It willliteraUy hunt 
you down," Shepard explained to me. 
Andreadis knew that the As1an tiger 
mosquito had caused an outbreak of 
disease marked by high 
fever, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, 
ras~ and joint pain 
on the French 
island of Reunion the year before. Well 
over a hundred thousand people fell 
sick. More gravely, the Asian tiger is a 
vector of Dengue virus, a disease that 
has recendy reemerged in the United 
States. In its most severe form, which 
is called Dengue hemorrhagic fever, 
patients experience flu-like symptoms at 
the onset, followed by severe bleeding 
from the nose and mouth and bleeding 
under the skin. In laboratory studies, the 
Asian tiger has successfully carried five 
viruses, including Eastern equine 
and yellow fever. Shepard 
warned that it could also be a vector for 
Japanese encephalitis as well as other, 
yet-to-be-discovered viruses. And this 
pernicious creature had just arrived in 
Connecticut. 


Batrling mosquitoes and defending 
against the diseases they carry is a 
grueling counterinsurgency, and the 
intelligence gathered at the Experix nent 
Station is vitally important to public 
health. When the researchers there isolate 
a virus, they immediately notify officials 
at the Department of Health. If a virus 
is regiona1ly concentrated or if a certain 
mosquito species is showing signs of 
increased viral activity, the program can 
advise local officials to spray insecticides 
or initiate other control mechanisms. 
According to Shepard, the goal is to 
prevent outbreaks not just of West 
ile but of any of the 
mosquito-
home viruses found in the state. The 
surveillance program's breadth across 
the state also allows for the 
·.totu 
of new and invasive species, like the 
stan nger mosqwto. 
ot even the most sophisticated


he researchers at the Experiment 
Station are all too familiar with the 
dangers of mosquito-born diseases. Culex 
·pipiens, a less dangerous vector than the 
Asian tiger, was the species. responsible 
for the 1999 West Nile epidemic in New 
York. "It was insane. It was 24/7. It was 
very explosive," recalls Andreadis. News 
coverage was around the clock. Trucks 
were spraying insecticide all over New 
York City. Calls were coming in daily to 
the station reporting dead birds 
crows 
were fa11ing out of the sky. 


No one knows for sure how the 
virus got to the United States. Because 
the first human cases were in Queens 
near two airports, the disease likely 
arrived on an airplane. Andreadis guesses 
that the culprit was an infected mosquito 
on a commercial transcontinental flight. 
But it could just as well have been an 
infected human returning from abroad, 
or a bird or mosquito in a ship's hold, 
he said. The virus that was eventually 
isolated matched most closely a strain 
that had caused a minor outbreak among 
an elderly population in Israel in 1957, 
so there was some speculation that it 
originated there. 


In the first chaotic days and weeks 
of the outbreak, though, no one realized 
that the New York City cases were 
actually West Nile. The virus had never 
been seen in the Western Hemisphere 
before, and no labs in the United States 
had West Nile isolates to test against. 
The New York virus was assumed to be 
St. Louis encephalitis, another disease 
for which Culex is the primary vector. 
On September 4, 
1999, John 
Anderson, 
then 
director 
of 
the 
Experiment Station, read a story in the 
New York Times under the headline, 
''Encephalitis Strikes 3 People, 1 Fatally, 
In Queens, City Says." It was a Saturday, 
and Anderson was working on houseflies 
somewhere in Eastern Connecticut. He 
heard similar reports of an outbreak on 
the radio and realized that something 
was up. ''I got a call that night asking-


-
if I wanted to' sit in on a telephone call 
the next day, Sunday, with the CDC and 
people from New York and other health 
directors from the region." (The CDC is 
. . 
. 
the federal Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention.) · Anderson called a 
technician in his lab to see if they had 
ever grown the·St. Louis encephalitis cell 
line. He needed something against which 
to test any viruses he might isolate. After . 
the call he went out to Greenwich and 
Stamford to set mosquito traps. 


Anderson couldn't simply walk 
iiito people's yards and place traps on a 
Sunday. in Greenwich, so he requested 
a police escort. None of this was new 
''Bird brains, 
they're not ve 
large. A crow 
brain is about 
like that size,'' 
Anderson tells 
me. ''And I just 
cut it in pie slices 
and isolated virus 
in eve 
section.'' 
to Anderson. Two years earlier he had 
established 
a 
small-scale 
mosquito 
surveillance program in Connecticut 
after an outbreak of Eastern equine 
encephalitis on the Rhode Island border. 
But this time, acquiring information 
about the spread of the virus would be 
critical to prevention efforts, and the 
Experiment Station had the regions' only 
facilities able to test mosquito samples 
and track the outbreak. 


A few days later a local Greenwich 
paper 
published 
story 
about 
Anderson's activities. That day he got 
a call from the ln.Qis Arden Golf Club 
in Old Greenwich. Members there were 
worried and had begun to complain of 
mosquitoes. The course thought it would 
be best to set a trap. ''And it was there we 
isolated this virus from two speci~s of 
mosquitoes," Anderson says. 


Meanwhile, crows continued to 
die, and one dead bird made it from 
the coastal town of Norwalk to the 
University of Connecticut in Hartford. 
Scientists there knew Anderson was 
working on the outbreak, and they 
called to offer him the bird's brain. "Bird 
brains, you know, they're not very large. 
A crow brain is about like that size," 
·Anderson tells me, holding up a hand 
with thumb and forefinger touching. 
''And I just cut it in pie slices and isolated 
virus in every section." Eventually 
Anderson tested the three separate virus 
isolates 
the bird and two mosquito 
species 
against antibodies from St. 
Louis encephalitis and found that the 
public health community's prior thinking 
had been wrong. The disease was not 
St. Louis. The team then analyzed the 
structural makeup of the virus's RNA. 
The sequence most closely matched a 
sequence of West Nile virus that had 
been isolated and recorded years earlier 
in Romania. · 


After scrambling day and night to 
pull a paper together, Anderson's team 
published their findings in the December 
1999 issue of Science. Anderson slides 
his copy across the conference room 
table where we've met. The abstract 
warns, "If established in North America, 
WN virus will likely have severe effects 
on human health and on the health of 
populations of birds." 


At that point, no one knew 
whether or not West Nile would 
successfully overwinter. In the earlier 
outbreaks in Europe it had failed to 
survive colder winter temperat:uies, and 
most in the United States thought the 
disease would not reappear the following 
spnng. 


But by 2003, "we had the largest 
epidemic of a mosquito-borne disease 
ever in North America," Andreadis said. 
The years from 2004 to 2008 were the 
"establishment phase:" The number 
of human cases settled to around a 


In order for an epidemic to occur, 
not only must a virus arrive in the United 
States, but it must also find a viable 
~osquito vector species that feeds on 
mammals 
more specifically, humans,-
and · that lives in urban and suburban 
areas. Otherwise, the virus poses no 
threat to humans. 


Mosquitoes 
are 
finicky 
where they breed. Some prefer natural, 
dry habitats, such as holes and crevices 
in trees and rocks. Others are simple 
container breeders and are 
happy 
anywhere water pools. Culex pipiens 
prefers artificial containers or stagnant 
pools with organic content, and it is 
highly tolerant of polluted water. In 
short, Culex mosquitoes love basements, 
ce11ars, and sewers 
all the byproducts 
of densely populated urban areas. 


In his office at the back of the lab, 
Dr. Andreadis pulls up a map on his 
computer screen. It shows the state of 
Connecticut with black circles marking 
sites where West Nile has been isolated 
from mosquitoes (seventy percent of 
West Nile isolates come from Culex 
pipiens). The do_ts are clustered along 
the I-95 corridor, a stretch that includes 
the cities of Greenwich, Stamford, 
Bridgeport, and New Haven, and 
around the state capital of Hartford. 


In Culex pipiens, West Nile found the 
perfect vector. 


edes albopictues 
the Asian tiger-
y 
prove 
itself 
similarly 
menacing vector for disease. No one 
knows more about the threat it poses 
than Dr. Paul Reiter, now the director of 
the Insects and Infectious Diseases Unit 
at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, who was 
the first person to find an Asian tiger 
mosquito in the Western Hemisphere. 


Since that fateful afternoon in a 
Memphis, Tennessee, cemetery in the 
fall of 1983, Reiter has tracked the global 
iovasion of Aedes albopictus into 36 states 
and nearly as many countries. 


Reiter stumbled into a life devoted 
to mosquitoes while working on a 
dissertation on the biochemistry of 
schizophienia. "I got very bored," he 
told me over the phone from his home 
in Paris. He later joked that he was 
tired of shuttling bottles of urine from 
schizophrenic patients to the lab for 
analysis. "There was a kind of Peace 
Corps type advert to go work in the 
Cayman Islands in the mosquito control 
unit. So I thought I'd do that for a year, 
and I got stuck." After the Cayman 
Islands, Reiter relocated to the CDC, 
where he was working in 1983. 


That year, the CDC sent· Reiter 
to Tennessee 
to 
study 
St. 
Louis 
encephalitis. He spent his days collecting 
mosquitoes for virus isolation in the 
fertile breeding grounds of culverts and 
storm sewers. Reiter, who is six feet tall, 
found it incredibly challenging to work 
hunched over in the five-foot diameter 
sewers. So he invented a trap that would 
allow him to collect Culex mosquitoes 
in open areas. He baited the trap with 
a putrid infusion he made by steeping 
hay in water for about a wee~ which 
was particularly attractive to Culex 
females ready to lay eggs. Reiter's trap 
is used today by mosquito survei11ance 
programs around the country, including 
Connecticut's. 


One evening Reiter got a call from 
his colleague Dick Darsie, the man 
tasked with sorriog through all Reiters 
mosquitoes before testing. ''He said, 
'Paul, you'll never guess what I've found 
in your collections.' And so I tried to 
guess and of course I got it wrong," 
Reiter recalled. Darsie had found an 
Asian tiger mosquito. Reiter didn>t doubt 
him Darsie 
knew 
his 
mosquitoes 
well and had worked on the species in 
South Asia years before. Reiter took the 
discovery to the Tennessee Deparunent 
of Health but was offered no support 
for further research. 


Reiter found no more albopictus 
for the next few years, and eventuaJly 
almost forgot about the species. He still 
wonders how that one mosquito got to 
Memphis. His only theory is that it came 
in a mail shipment from Houston. Both 
Houston and Memphis have large mail 
sorting facilities; Houston is a major 
port, and, as it later turned out, it was 
albopictus' probable point of entry when 
it eventually took hold in the United 
States. The mail facility in Memphis was 
just across the street _from the cemetery 
where Reiter trapped that first mosquito. 


"I looked at the place on Google 
the other day and could see the exact 
spot where the trap was," Reiter told me 
almost nostalgically. ''Perhaps we can 
put a plaque there one day." 


n 1986 the CDC asked Reiter to go 
down to Houston. Reports were 
coming in of a new mosquito, and 
descriptions suggested it might be 
the Asian tiger. "Obviously I was the 
expert," Reiter joked, '1>ecause I had 
caught one mosquito." 


In Housto~ Reiter and a colleague 
spent most of their time exploring tire 
dumps. Tire piles are just about the 
perfect breeding sites for mosquitoes. 
When water gets in a tire it never leaves, 
and it collects organic material that is very 
attractive to female mosquitoes. They 
were finishing up at a site one afternoon 
when a pickup truck came down the road 
and stopped about 150 yards from where 
Reiter had parked. Two men got out and 
started rummaging through the tire pile. 
Reiter watched as they started throwing 
some of the tires he had marked into 
their· truck. Reiter had planned to come 
back to check on breeding mosquitoes, 
so he went up to them and asked what 
they were doing with the ri res. The 
tires, it turned out, would be shipped to 
Mexico and Guatemala. ''I thought, 'Oh,
