Stead, won this year's Caldecott Medal, 
the -country's most prestigious award 
for picture book illustrators. It is the 
third Caldecott winner to be published 
by Roaring Brook Press, which this 
year celebrates its tenth anniversary 
of producing high quality, hardcover, 
"literary" children's books. 


Though 
it 
started 
small 
in 
Brookville, 
Connecticut, 
Roaring 
Book is now an imprint of New York 
publishing goliath Macmillan. · Simon 
Boughton, Roaring Brook's founder 
and publisher, still resides in Westport, 
where he supports the local children's 
libraries 
arranging, for example, for 
Erin Stead to come speak to the lucky 
children of Fairfield County. 


Poetic picture books are Roaring 
Brook's · specialty. Its other Caldecott 
winners are My Friend Rabbit (2003) and 
The Man Who Walked Between the Towers 
(2004). First the Egg, also published by 
Roaring Brook, was a Caldecott runner-
up in 2008. 


The 
Association. 
for 
Library 
Services to Children, or ALSC, awards 
the Caldecott prize. The organization 
prescribes specific criteria for Caldecott 
winners, but Thorn Barthelmess, a career 
children's librarian cu.rrendy serving 
on the faculty of the graduate library 
school at Dominican University and the 
president of the ALSC since 2009, said it 
really boils down to this: A good picture 
book is born when "first, the people 
making the book have something to say, 
and second, they have a way to say it that 
is somehow meaningful, that has some 
kind of relationship to the story itself." 


Maybe the success of Roaring 
Brook can be traced to its small size. 
It publishes fewer books than its 
competitors but publishes them more 
carefully. Boughton likes to seek out 
authors and artists who are overlooked 
by larger operations and offer them 
an 
"old-fashioned, 
small-shop 
kind 
of attention." Boughton also credited 
Roaring Brook with having top-notch 
editors. A good children's book editor, 
he said, can read just a few words on a 
piece of paper and envision the whole 
work with illustration. A good editor can 
judge "what is going to appeal not just to 
children but also to the people who put 
picture books in the hands of children." 


Roaring Brook has maintained its 
focus on picture books at a time when 
teen fiction is receiving most of the 
youth publishing industry's attention. 
The exact reasons for the teen fiction 
phenomenon are debated in the industry, 
but kids are undeniably starting to read 
black-and-white fiction at a younger 
age. As a result, Boughton said, "the old 
fashioned traditional picture book has 
gotten squeezed." 


Still, the picture book remains an 
indispensable literary genre. And in 
terms of child development, picture 
books teach concepts like colors and 
the alphabet as well as lessons in 
emotions like friendship, love, and anger. 
''Whatever emotion you want to name, 
there's a picture book that deals with it,'~ 
Boughton said. 


In Barthelmess's estimation, "really 
genius picture books" are ones that play 
around with the relationship between 
text and illustration 
the ones in which 
the words tell one story, the pictures 
tell another, and there's a third story in 
the words and pictures together. As an 
example, Barthelmess likes to discuss 
1996 Caldecott winner Officer Buckle and 
Gloria. Officer Buckle is a safety officer 
whose lectures to schoolchildren go 
from being dreaded to loved after he is 
assigned a police dog, Gloria. The text 
suggests that he's giving safety tips and 
the kids are really enjoying it, but the 
picrures show that while he is presenting, 
Gloria is behind him, goofily acting out 
his words. The text tells his story. The 
pictures tell hers. The book is complete 
only when the two are fused. 


Picture 
books, 
Boughton 
said, 
tend to succeed in the "space between 
the words and the pictures," not on the 
strength of one or the other. The whole 
of a picture book is greater than the sum 
of its parts. 


And they add up to a lot, Ba.rthelmess 
explained. ''You're beginning to lay the 
foundation, the scaffold, . for deeper 
literary understandings and investigation 
throughout the rest of their life," he 
said. ''You don't sit a three year old down 
and say, 'We're going to read A Sick Day 
for Amos McGee so you'll be ready to read 
Hamlet later.' But in fact that's what's 
happening." 


Boughton told me that illustrated 
picture books become art objects as 
well as literature 
and when you hold 
it in your hand, Sick Day does feel like 
a work of art. Words aside,. the pictures 
are lovely. The turde carries Amos's 
teapot and cup to him on his back, the 
scarf-clad rhinoceros holds out a tissue 
on his horn, the penguin watches his red 
balloon float toward the moon as his 
friends sleep piled up beneath him. The 
words tell us that Amos says goodnight 
to his friends, but they cannot capture 
the way Amos rests his hand on . the 
elephant's trunk, rubs his toes against 
the rhino's snout, or holds the penguin 
under his arm as they crowd together on 
the bed before sleeping . 


Artists are embracing Photoshop 
and other digital tools, incorporating 
them into their illustrations. Many 
picture books are now available · for 
iPad and other electronic devices. But 
in Sick Day, all of the illustrations were 
hand-sketched, hand-carved, and hand-
painted. As Barthelmess put it, "They're 
painterly. They're intended to look 
personal, like a human made them." 


Above all, books like this are one 
proof of Barthelmess's belief that 
there will always be people who "are 
committed to the beauty of an honest 
story." Sick Day is, as Boughton put 
it, "a book about friendship, a book 
about having the day off, a book about 
going somewhere." Timeless themes, in 
literature and in life.
