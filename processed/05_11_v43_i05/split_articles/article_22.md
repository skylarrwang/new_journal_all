danger the Angels are looking out for.
But I can also see how Tank's chest
puffs up with manly pride as he brags to
me, the way he keeps straightening his
uniform and adjusting his beret. Angels
are eyes on the street, but they also want
eyes on them.

At the end of that night's patrol,
as I'm. waiting for a cab to come pick
me up from the headquarters back in
Edgewood, Cisco turns to me.
''Wives and sisters shouldn't have to
walk alone and be afraid, you know?" He
stares at me from.his wide dark eyes and
fixes me with a penetrating look. "That
ain't right."

It is the first time tonight that he
makes eye contact with me. My cab pulls
. up. He thrusts a large palm at me to
shake my hand before opening the cab
door for me.

ocky has served with the Angels
he was in his twenties, and
this October marked his thirtieth year of
22
patrolling community after community,
spending .nights out on cold streets all
over the northeast.

Rocky ran away from his home
·in Brooklyn at 15 and spent the next
few years of his life living with fellow
runaways · on the streets of Hell's
Kitchen, where he was a member of
an informal gang. The group of boys
lived together and looked out for each
other, occasionally getting into fights
with other loosely organized gangs and
painting graffiti around the city.

Gangs, he says, promise wayward
youths like himself love. Gangs lure in
stragglers off the street with beds to
sleep in and friends to take care of them,
and before they know it they are handed
guns and asked to do someone a favor,
to take care of something for them, to
help do their duty for the neighborhood.
Help protect the neighborhood, because
no one else is watching out.

But the Angels make no such
· promises, and they attract members
who, in Rocky's words, are seeing things
they're sick of on the streets, things
they want to stop. They're just ordinary
citizens, he says, looking to make a
difference.

Though Rocky has been in the
Angels' service for thirty years, he has
only been stationed in New Haven for
five months. He spent the last several
years moving from chapter to chapter
around Connecticut and New Jersey,
reviving chapters that had fallen by
the wayside. The New Haven chapter
is· Rocky's latest project, and he aims
to train a squadron of committed and
talented patrollers in two years. Despite
Rocky's years of commitment, he is
still a volunteer, and so are all the other
patrollers. Though a cabinet-maker by
trade, Rocky has had trouble finding
work in cabinetry, so now he's working
m construction.

Rocky's scrapbook holds archives of
thirty years of the organization's history.

She was
also an Angel. One
snapshot showed her g1aring from

all three with arms folded. Her mouth
turned up just the slightest bit at the
corners in a nearly unnoticeable grin. I
tried to imagine her on the streets with
the Angels, and how it would feel to be

us. Tank and Cisco aren't here tonight,
to my dismay. Tonight's plan is to do
some recruiting in the downtown area

seems to be going well thus far

their fl.yets in a laundromat. In the back
corner of the room, a whiteboard looms
large with words "GOAL: RECRUIT 30
MEMBERS BY AUGUST 12, 2011."

Before letting me out of the Angels'
sight, Rocky wants me to have some self-
defense techniques to use if something
were to happen. I stand up obediently,
leaving my recorder and notepad on the
couch. He tells me to come at him. I grab
him by the collar of his grey hoodie,
waiting for bini to show ·me some new
ways to bust free. Startled, he looks up
at me and glances around to the other
Angels watching us in the middle of the
room.
''Whoa
she's kinda strong!"
They laugh.

a few quick tips on how to get out of
various choke holds, many of which a
five-foot, hundred-pound girl would

size in real life. After I struggle free, I'm
instructed to knee my attacker in the
groin and run and scream.
''It's basic stuff that any woman
should know," he tells me. "Or guy."
The Angels nod somberly.

As I make the walk home that night,
facing the streets on foot this time,
without a taxi to carry me home safely,
I practice a fe~ of the moves again,

myself screaming in the face
of an attacker and sprinting away. I can't
help but laugh at the pictnre. But Rocky's

staying safe is a serious matter,
and even if these vigi1antes sometimes
talk bigger ta1k than I'd expect from a
group of unarmed, beret-topped men, I
feel somehow more protected knoMng
they're keeping an eye on the streets.
I wa1k alone, but two blocks over, I
know, the Guardian Angels are watching,
making their weekly rounds.
