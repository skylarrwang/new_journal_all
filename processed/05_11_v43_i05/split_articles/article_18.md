**Healthier Options in New Haven's Bodegas**
**Author: Jake Conway**
**Page number(s): 15**

New Haven's bodegas are interested in offering healthier options, but economic conflicts of interest might delay concrete changes.


On our way over to the West River neighborhood, a former Italian enclave that is now predominantly black and Hispanic, Stacy Spell and I drive past a dilapidated storefront, its windows boarded up, its sidewalk dusty with the residue of melted street snow.


"See," Spell beams at me, "the potential is here." Spell is the head of the West River Neighborhood Services Corporation, which has recently partnered with the Community Alliance for Research and Engagement (CARE) at Yale's School of Public Health to consult with local bodega owners about developing new business models that promote healthier options for consumers.


A former New Haven Police Department detective for over twenty years, Spell has the rough-and-ready wit and steadfast commitment to his community of the best law enforcement officers. He has lived in West River for most of his life and does not plan on leaving, despite some bad memories here. His nephew, an innocent bystander, was killed in 2000 at the package store next to the George Street Deli.


Like most convenience stores, George Street Deli has a few aisles stocked with basic groceries - rice, dried beans, flour, sugar, canned goods - as well as household cleaning supplies, a rack of chips and nuts up front, a bank of candy and gum under the counter; and a register encased by protective glass where lottery tickets and cigarettes sit. There are no fresh fruits or vegetables for sale, except for potatoes and onions and maybe a few plantains. The only other perishables are bread, milk, and whole milk.


Bodegas fill a key niche in the urban ghetto, especially in "food deserts" like New Haven, which has a core population of 130,000 but no supermarket. (A Stop & Shop is slated to open in the former Shaw's location this month, but many will still lack access to groceries.)
