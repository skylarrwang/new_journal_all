taxi driver, "I would like to go to the
mall, please," I did not want to hear "If
God wills it" as a response. It seemed
fatalist. I wanted to reply, "No, it's not
up to God; it's up to you. Take some
responsibility."


On March 13, I woke up late in
my bedroom in Bahrain, still jedagged
several days after having arrived from
·New Haven. "Protestors are blocking
the highway in the financial district. It's
looking violent again," my mom told me.
''We'll go tomorrow to get the necklace
I had restrung for you." But we couldn't
go the next day, or the day after that. I
departed Bahrain without my necklace.


I did not leave my immediate
neighborhood those last three days in
Bahrain. Very quickly, the country started
sliding toward anarchy. Protestors took
.
over whole villages and neighborhoods.
On March 14, I saw a photo online of
tanks rolling across the causeway from
Saudi Arabia to Bahrain, sent to regain
order by the countries in the Gulf
Cooperation Council. Iran claimed this
was a Saudi invasion. The next day, the .
king of Bahrain declared the country
to be in a state of emergency, and two
civilians were killed in the protests.


I had assumed online news sources
updated almost instantaneously. I quickly
realized this isn't true: News articles
appeared online in the evening, after a
whole day had passed. Most of the time,
we did not know what was happening.
Rumors flew: The troops had not come
yet. They were already here, breaking
up protests. There were roving bands
of men destroying shop fronts. People
who worked in the financial district
were being threatened by their village
neighbors, and physically prevented
from coming into the city. A few people
had died. Many people had died.


I remember distinctly the sounds
of that time. The wind kept up for
several days. The palm . leaves rustled.
A wind chime jangled. Helicopters
droned constantly. Something, maybe
a shutter I never figured out what:--
banged in the wind with a gun-like
report.


My father and I walked the perimeter
46
of the compound every night. Once, the
sky was extravagantly colored
lavender
with tangerine clouds. Then I decided
the sky was tangerine, and the clouds
were lavender. I kept changing my mind.
My dad quoted ·Dryden on that walk:
All things are subject to decay,
And, when Fate summons, monarchs
must obey.


I left the compound with my mother
to drive to a hotel pool down the road.
It was a way to think about something
other than the political situation for a
few hours. There, I swam laps, then sat
in a deck chair in the sun. A waitress
ewtn
e t
or several
ters
rone
constant
came by to ask if I wanted anything to
eat or drink. While demonstrators and
police sparred fifteen minutes away by
car, I worked on my tan.


At the pool one day, another regular
swimmer
an
American
woman-
stopped to talk to my mom. "Did you
see the embassy notice today?" she
asked.
'<yes
warning Americans not to
come."
"And telling Americans to leave."
''Well I'm not leaving. I think it's
ridiculous. We're sending our daughter
back tonight, though, earlier
than
planned. We figure we might as well."
Then they talked about how they had the
same bathing suit, bought at Marshall's.
I kept thinking about moments such
as this one even as they happened. It was
strange. Something historical was going
on. But life keeps going, and there was
little to do other than what we normally
did.


flight was at 2:00 a.m., but we
"~ for the airport at 10:00 p.m.,
hours earlier than we normally would.
The night before, the opposition had set
up a checkpoint on the highway we were
planning to take, and traffic had been
delayed for hours.


The roads were empty, however.
An alley of food stands usually bustling
with activity was completely dark except
for the fluorescent lights of a single
shawarma
stand,
glowing
defiantly.
We said little on the way, listening to
Mozart's violin concertos
my father's
choice. Near the airport, we were waved .
through two police checkpoints. My
mom commented on the recently raised
prices at the airport parking lot.


Only one of the airport's doors was
open, and a policeman stood in front of
it. My dad approached him.
"Passengers only."
''We're checking in our daughter."
"No, sorry, just passengers."
"Well, then, take my driver's license
until I come back out."
"No."


That night, outside of the airport
and in front of my parents, the police
officer, and about a dozen other people,
I started sobbing.


Once I collected myself, I said
goodbye to my parents in front of the
airport and went in. I wasn't scared
about checking in on my own. I had had
a terrible thought. I did not know when
I was going to return to Bahrain.


n March 18, New Haven had a
perfect spring morning. There
were robins in the Davenport courtyard.
The Yale campus was quiet. In Bahrain,
the Pearl Roundabout was also quiet'--
completely empty. After the protestors
were cleared out of the area, government .
bulldozers
entered and razed
the
monument.
I'll be back soon. Inshallah.

dream about trains. I ride the .rails, shooting across continents and coasting th.rough da.rk tunnels unde.r
city streets. Ticket stubs a.re my bookma.rks and timetables, my wallpaper. One .recent evening, some local
news piqued
and off-peaked
my interest.


I was sitting in a lib.ra.ry window seat when I saw that fi.rst train ca.r's interior shine forth from my laptop
screen. Suited commuters scanned legal briefs, g.reen coats dangled from sleek overhead luggage .racks, a
bea.rded man slept peacefully. The blu.r.red scenery th.rough the windows could have been anywhere. Was
this France's TGV? Japan's Shinkansen? The Orient Express? Another photo showed this same silver bullet
shooting across a familia.r concrete landscape of parking ga.rages and office buildings: this was New Haven.
This was Metro-N o.rth!


Metro-N o.rth, that ca.rrie.r of commuters and conce.rtgoe.rs, that pu.rveyo.r of sticky linoleum and sweaty
vinyl seat~, has a new look. Eight new Kawasaki M8 ca.rs on the New Haven line debuted this Ma.rch,
.replacing a small slice of the existing thi.rty-yea.r-old fleet. By the end of spring, 26 scarlet-striped ca.rriages
will be .rolling into stations f.rom he.re to G.rand Central. The.re will be eighty in use by the yea.r's end.
Eventually, 380 shiny ca.rs will make up the fleet. Enlarged bath.rooms, speckled floors, electronic destination
signs, seat-side powe.r outlets, and th.rones of sumptuous .red leather will propel Metro-North's riders into the
future.


·
Realizing this could be the most exciting news in locomotion since the fi.rst train ran from the Elm City
to the Big Apple in 1849, I checked the day>s rail schedule at bettermetronorth.com. There was a train leaving
at 10:10 p.m. There would be enough time fo.r me to make a round trip to Bridgeport or even across state
lines to Grand Central
before the night was th.rough. With excitement, trepidation, and not a single doubt,
I hopped in a taxi and paid my fa.re upon a.rrival at Union Station.


As I shuffled to the ticket machines, the 10:10 listing flipped to '~I .I. ABOARD" on the old analog
depa.rture-boa.rd, which is slated for replacement this spring. I purchased my ticket and eagerly made my way
to track 14.


But the old yellow headlights in the distance told n1e all I needed to know: There would be no
rendezvous with the Kawasaki M8 this evening. As die veteran ca.rs rattled into the station, I wondered what
had come over me. I did not want to go to New York.


I ran back th.rough the tunnel and up to the street. Not even stopping for a consolation treat from
Dunkin' Donuts, I boa.rded the Yale shuttle and headed back to campus. The.re were no plush seats or sleek
screens for comfort, but this old Blue-line bus was talcing me where I wanted to go.


I tucked my rail ticket into my wallet. Another day, perhaps, I'll ride the train of my dreams.
