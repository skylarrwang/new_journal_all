the company to pay back the loan." In 
this type of deal, the client, interested 
in acquiring a company but unsure of 
how 
to arrange the 
financing, 
approaches Dillan 
R eed, 
:vvhich 
evaluates the purchaser's assets as well 
as 
the 
financial 
situation of the 
company the client wants to buy. 
Incorporating factors such as the 
current and projected activity of the 
market and its possible effect on the 
growth of the industry involved, the 
investment bank engineers a strategy 
to finance the purchase. The bank then 
tries to sell the plan to the purchaser, 
and receives a percentage of the sale as 
commission if the deal goes through. 
Analysts serve in this operation by 
"number crunching"- performing the 
fundamental calculations- as well as 
by doing the backg.round financial 
research that goes into the report. 
Because his firm is small, Phleger 
bears responsibility for several facets of 
total 
deal, 
while 
in 
larger 
companies the work is divided more by 
department. When the analysis is 
complete, Phleger writes the report 
and visits the client to try to s~l ~ the 
proposal. 


Barry johnson OE '85), a first-year 
analyst at First :aoston, said that the 
"glamour level" of his job vacillates 
widely. "First Boston buys you a first-
class ticket and you go and present 
what you've done, and you're a real 
star. But then the next day you may be 
back in the office doing mindless 
xeroxing for someone." But unlike 
Phleger, Johnson feels that the excite-
ment of presenting his own analysis to 
a client and making the sale outweighs 
the tedium of performing "grunt 
work." Johnson mentioned his col-
leagues as another source of pleasure 
in his job. "At Yale you're used to 
working around smart, 
motivated 
people- that's what this office is like, 
and I find it stimulating." 


Susan McGarry (BK '83) explained 
that she gains more satisfaction from 
using her job as a means toward ac-
complishing good 
for companies. 
McGarry, who holds the second-level 
!>Osition of associate at Shearson-
Lehman Brothers, worked with a small 
company in Oregon which was finan-
cially strapped because of competition 
with the Japanese. By 
finding a 
corporate partner for the company, her 
firm allowed it to continue to grow. 
M cGarry 
said 
that at 
Yale 
her 
political views did not represent what 
she considered the stereotypically con-
servative 
politics of investment 
bankers. However, she then felt that 
altering 
system 
required 
understanding its financial structure. 
Investment bankers often stress the 
social benefits of their profession, 
asserting that while large corporate 
mergers grab media attention, their 
firms' activities include a number of 
projects \\hich aid smaller businesses. 
In addition. thev benefit the American 
consumer by m'aking individual com-
panies and rhe general economy more 
efficient.

social value of investment banking.

vestment banking's ·focus on spec-

emphasis on the the large buyouts and 
acquisitions which investment bankers 
engineer leads the nation into "a 
casino-like economy, rather than a 
more stable, long term economy that 
America needs." 


Though students may exaggerate 
social benefits of investment 
banking, they seem to be right about 
one thing: the wages. Commissions on 
investment banks' high-powered deals 
yield large salaries. The average 
analyst's annual salary is roughly S30 
thousand, with an additional year-end 
bonus related to performance. The 
bonus generally ranges from 15-50 per· 
cent of the analysts' pay, resulting in an 
enviable 
income. 
These 
rewards oft<;n keep people in the job. 
According to Johnson, "there are some 
financially obsessed investment 
bankers. Within the company, you 
hear stories of 28-yf.'ar-old 
vice 
presidents making S800 thousand a 
year and these are not lies." Johnson 
believes that for those who originally 
planned to stay in investment banking 
a short time, the money can become 
addictive. '"The thing is, the more 
money you make, the more you want, 
so you stay. You were 25, and then you 
turn around and you're 38." Phleger 
enjoys the flexibility his salary gives 
him, but sees potential harm: "There's 
a 
danger 
earning 
all 
that 
money- there's a tendt>ncy to hide 
behind it and feel superior to someone 
who's probably putting a lot more 
thought into their job than you are." 


Though many applicants 
to 
investment banks expect to enjo> Ne" 
York's culture and social life, analysts 
work almost constantly. Therr hours 
\'arv. but most work weekends and say 
that the unpredictable nature of the 
work 
makes 
plannin't social 
engagements 
nearly 
impossible.

boss, he was back at his computer by 
10 p.m. and worked until 2 p.m. the 
next 
day. 
Over the 
telephone, 
Phleger's voice continually trails off. 
He apologizes, saying that he is too 
exhausted to put thoughts together 
well. "Normal people don't do this 
shit," Phleger says. J ohnson's hours at 
First Boston are not as extreme; he 
generally works a 10-12 hour day, as 
well as most Saturdays and Sundays. 
"But it's not all weekend," he explains. 
"Most Sundays you don't come in 
before noon." Johnson says he ca~ 
handle the hours, but he has little time 
for other parts of his life, such as 
playing the violin. "Life has to be more 
balanced," he says. 


Many analysts voiced the concern 
undergraduates drift 
toward 
investment banking for the wrong 
reasons, with little knowledge of the 
actual nature of the job. 
Susan 
Hauser, dean of Career Services,says 
too many students don't know . what 
they want. "Where do you think this 
word 
'clueless' comes 
from?" . she 
demands. 
Large numbers· of 
undergraduates apply to investment 
banks because it's easy. They need 
only submit resumes to "CAPS," which. 
forwards them to each company. In 
addition, for some StJJdents, the fact
