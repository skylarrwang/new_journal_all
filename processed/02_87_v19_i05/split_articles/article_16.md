members of the cult asked Hill if he 
wanted to go through the deeper 
initiation, he decided against it, for a 
vow of secrecy would prevent him 
revealing anything he had 
learned. "My goal had to do more with 
the music rather than the layers of 
ritual," he says. He eventually turned 
his research into his master's thesis. 


Returning to the United States in 
1977, Hill found it difficult to adjust to 
the American 
lifestyle and value 
system. He decided not to live in New 
York, moved to Middletown and 
began studying drumming privately 
monies, his first exposure to music as a 
religious ritual. "I was drumming for 
people who were dancing, becoming 
possessed, and going into trances," Hill 
explains. "I was fascinated and blown 
away by the whole thing." 


In his teaching, Hill combines a conceptual, analytic, and linear approach with an intuitive 
o ne. 


Wanting to explore and prove an 
instinctual belief that the music was 
responsible for inducing the trance, 
Hill decided to live in Haiti for a few 
weeks and then to travel to West 
Africa. From 1974 to 1976 he studied 
at the University of Ghana with the 
ute of African Studies masters

"Assume you're a rank beginner, and 
take the second block and place it on 
the first, making sure the foundation is 
there." Maria Sieira (SM,'90), 
a 
student in Hill's class this semester, 
says that he "leads you· into the patterns

and goes up. It's not 'look at the

H ill began to form what could be

where learning any instrument is a

Though Hill admits that teaching 
college students can be frustrating 
because he finds them "self-deluded" 
and having "a tremendous deficit in 
terms of experience and hard 
knowledge,'' he's amazed by 
seriousness and sensitivity of those who 
enroll in his classes. "It's hard trying to 
make what's intangible

when thinking a
