The 1294 faces appearing in this year's 
Old Campus belong to students with 
different racial backgrounds, interests, 
and places to call home, but they have 
in common a trait easily picked up in 
pictures- their youth. Another, much 
smaller group of freshmen don't have 
pictures in tlie Old Campus. Known as 
Special Students, they fill nil¥! places 
in this year's entering class, >and 33 
places overall. Most are over 30 years 
old, and they commute considerable 
distances, restructure work schedules 
and sacrifice family time in order to 
pursue the college degree that, for 
various reasons, has eluded them. If 
the traditional Old Campus profiles the 
Class of '90 by asking who has edited 
their school newspaper, acted in plays 
or cried at their 
high 
school 
graduation, then a hypothetical Old 
Campus for Special Students might ask 
who has worked as a doctor, founded a 
company, or cried at their son or 
daughter's high school graduation. 

Along with the profiles, the pictures 
of the class would look strikingly 
different. At an art history lecture 
attended by hundreds of students, 
Beverly Graham's long silver hair 
distinguished her even from the back. 

O nce the owner of an interior-design 
business in Seattle, 
Washington, 
Graham moved east and enrolled with 
the first group of Special Students in 
1977. At that time they could take up 
to 18 courses for credit, only half the 
requirements for an undergraduate 
degree. Many of them came for the 
same reasons that over 100 non-degree 
students come today: to prepare for 
graduate school, to gain background 
for a specific career, to accumulate 
college credits, or to find personal 
enrichment. But Graham didn't want 
her education 
stop 
halfway. 

Discouraged by 
Yale's 
policy, 
she 
applied elsewhere to finish up the 
second half of her degree. Then she 
learned that Yale was beginning to 
accept students into a full degree 
program for the fall of 1982. She 
applied, was accepted again, and 
started new courses later that year. 

Successful 
in 
business, 
Graham 
didn't need a diploma to advance 
professionally, but she felt she was 
missing something personally. "I felt I 
was a very unique person and very 
capable. People would assume I had 
gone to college, and I wondered if they 
changed their opinion of me because 
I hadn't. Maybe that bothered me," she 
says. Although she had taken some 
college art courses after finishing high 
school, 
her education had been 
interrupted by 
marriage, 
her 
husband's 
Naval 
assignments, 
motherhood. Over 20 years later, as 
her own children finished college or got 
married, she decided to return to 
school. 

"They are the only 
ones who can have a 
developed sense of 
social change, and 
social change is what 
history is all about." 

According to Edith · MacMullen, 
administrator of the program, desire for 
personal fulfillment accounts for the 
enrollment of many of the women in the 
program- in fact, women make up 25 of 
the 33 students this term. "At my age 
they had families, worked to put their 
spouses through school. So we have 
numbers of them in their late 30's and 
40's who are extraordinary, but for 
whom going to college was not an 
automatic path," MacM ullen says. 

Professors such as J ohn Blum, whose 
3 7 
year-old daughter r ecen tly 
graduated from the U n iversity of 
Massachusetts, feel that the disparity 
in numbers between men a nd women 
in the program is not coincidental. 

"Many women didn't get to go to college, 
but conscious of themselves and the 
women's move1nent they want to go 
back to it," Blum explains. 

Priscilla Sample, 31 years old, lives 
with her husband and son an hour from 
Yale. 

She 
felt 
unc h a ll e n ged 
by her secretarial work in a law firm 
and realized she would never move 
into a higher position without a de-
gree. She currently does not participate 
in the degree program at Yale, but 
she hopes to be accepted into it next fall, 
has 
star ted 
t aking 
courses. "Through the years, getting a 
degree has always been important to 
me. 
I always thought I had 
potential to do more," she says.
