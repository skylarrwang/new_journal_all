Walk into Richard Hill's Tuesday 
night drumming class, and you'll find 
nine students sitting in a circle- each 
on a stool or wooden bench with a 
drum resting against their knees. The 
class is held i

members of the New Haven-based, 
Afro-Caribbean funk band which Hill 
created in 1982. You'll see pictures of 
them in concert in Central Park and at 
Lighthouse Point. Ask Hill about the 
drawing of a cop standing on a pier 
surrounded by musicians, and he'll tell 
you of

cream on his 
nds as though pre-
paring for a ritu . The students get 
comfortable, looking from Hill to their 
drums as they practice. "Don't rush. 
Take your time," he says evenly. "Dah, 
dah, dah, dah," he counts aloud. 
People warm up from the cold. Sweat-
ers come off. The students watch Hill, 
following his lead, changing tempo as 
he does. Sounds of the drums echo 
through the room. "Sounds great," he 
says occas

downbeat. It tricks you, but if it's done 
eloquently enough, the dancers will be 
pulled into accenting that place." He 
claps as they play. They repeat the 
same rhythm over and over. "Why 
does the tempo suddenly speed up?" 
someone asks, 
Hill 
answers 
straightforwardly: "Anxiety related to 
boredom." Heads nod in agreement. 
Understatement seems to be the 
Richard Hill style. He stares straight 
ahead as he talks, rarely making eye 
contact. He speaks in measured tones, 
clearly and strongly. When he jokes it's 
a complete deadpan. Explaining where 
the drums used in the class are made, 
Hill says, "Well, some are from 
Mexico, one was built by a friend of 
mine, and . . . uh . . . that one is a 
typical Ricky Ricardo type." People 
laugh, but Hill's face hardly moves.

been known to break into song 
spontaneously during class. "He's also 
a 
great 
impressionist," 
says Jeff 
McQuillan, co-director of the group. 
"He has that ability to capture the 
spirit, the soul of somebody, and act it 
out." 

Though not 
at 
all an 
imposing 
presence, 
there's something about 
Richard Hill's manner, his intensity 
perhaps, that almost compels you to 
focus on him, to listen to his every 
word. He's thin, average height with 
dark hair and eyes and a long narrow 
face. From the outside, he looks li 
your typical white guy from the 
East Side who played the drums 
junior high- which is actually true. 

Yet, you need ooly talk with him for a 
few minutes to discover that it's more 
complicated, much deeper than that. 
"He's a hard person to try ·to pin 
down," says Maureen O 'Leary (SY 
'87), who's taking Hill's 
class this semester. "He

who owned her own retail shop, both 
played 
lot of jazz and 
blues 
recordings and frequently had 
musicians play in their home. Meeting 
singer Paul Robeson, blacklisted for 
his supposed "communist" activities, 
made a lasting impression on Hill. "I 
was at 
party 
where 
he 
was 
performing," he says. 
" It was 
extremely thrilling to me, because he 
was this mythic figure." Then on his 
own Hill started listening to a lot of 
rural blues, jazz and some gospel. 

Though he starting playing a drum 
let in junior high and studied with a 
professional jazz drummer after his 
parents had moved the family to 
Connecticut, Hill wasn't a seriou 
student of music until he reached h · 
mid-twenties. "I had an affinity fi

As a white interested in black music, 
Hill discovered early on the problems

college at Antioch, he was exposed o

taking dance classes himself. 

"There's a gladness that takes over when we start to play together in class. Your hands take
