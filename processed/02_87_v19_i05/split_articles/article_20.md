Too many students are leaving Yale "clueless," according to Susan Hauser, dean of Career Services.  that investment banks come to campus to interview gives them an advantage over other firms and organizations in the public sector. Others voice the criticism that Career Services does not emphasize alternatives, so that seniors have little idea of what types of jobs exist.

Professionals express concern that liberal arts majors suppress stronger interests to join the crowd and go into investment banking. Rosensweig believes that "a lot of students are pretending that what they want to do is put on dark suits and red ties with polka-dots and conform. I wish their interests were more broad." According to Phleger, his company has bound into a book the roughly 150 current Yale resumes it received for eight vacancies. Reading these resumes, Phelger said, "there are interesting people applying to this job. Sometimes I want to call them up and say 'think again.'"

Once seniors express interest and show promise, investment banks know how to make themselves attractive. They court candidates with style. Lynch was impressed by the way Prince Webber treated him during the interview process in New York, putting him up in a hotel room that cost $190 and buying him a $25 breakfast. "It blows your mind to be a college student and be treated like that. It's an ego boost," he says. Phleger says he fell into an easy trap in taking an analyst position. "In many ways it's an easy way to go. I did it. You send in your resume, put on your suit, and go over to CAPS. The guy loves you and you've got a job. It's paradoxically very safe, because you're told what to do with all your time for two years." Phleger says that investment banking recruiters exploit the confusion of liberal-arts graduates who are bombarded with the idea that their broad education is not marketable. "Investment banking is one of the only jobs that tells you you're great for being a liberal-arts major," he says.


In spite of warnings like Phleger's and tough competition, students interview in droves, pleased to have been offered an interview but put off by the pressure and attention they receive from other students. According to Beach, interviewing at CAPS is convenient but also frustrating. "You put on your suit and trudge over to CAPS, trying to hide from people on the way over because they make subtle critical remarks like 'Oh, so you're doing the corporate thing?'" Beach doesn't have time to stop and explain her reasons to everyone she passes, and resents the idea that she should. She believes criticism of investment banking applicants comes from those who consider them to be "selling out." Though she says this phrase is indefinable, she feels that it has to do with performing work one does not want to do, and sacrificing one's happiness or dream. "I wouldn't be doing this if it were 'Selling out," she said quietly.

Whether or not students entering the profession are selling out, prospective investment bankers need to be more aware of what they're getting into. On campus one finds a great deal of both breathless praise and knee-jerk criticism, but very little thoughtful and objective discussion of the job itself. As a result, seniors who drift into investment banking may find their vague expectations left unfulfilled. To all, the job offers high wages, financial literacy, and sporadic glamour. But to only some does it provide satisfaction. Others, like Phleger, want out. After two years spent grinding away in a service industry, these investment bankers feel like they're financing someone else's dream instead of pursuing their own.
