Art and Beauty in the Middle Ages, by Umberto Eco, translated by Hugh Bredin, Yale University Press (New Haven and London: 1986) $12.95, 146 pages.

In the preface to his Art and Beauty in the Middle Ages, Umberto Eco states that he was "rather reluctant" to allow Yale University Press to republish a piece written originally as a "single chapter of a four volume handbook on the history of aesthetics" first published 28 years ago. Standing outside the context of this larger, more comprehensive treatment of theories of beauty, this republication is too close to an encyclopedia entry to survive on its own. Although he synthesizes his diverse material brilliantly and imaginatively, Eco is never able to devote enough time to any one topic. This "chapter," seeking to become a "book" (one might suspect for the profit of the publisher or the career of the translator), represents an ambitious attempt to collate the aesthetic theories of eleven centuries, an attempt that displays its potential but never fulfills it.

Eco is known to most readers and movie-goers as the author of The Name of the Rose, a bestselling murder mystery set in a medieval monastery. Currently a professor of semiotics at the University of Bologna (and a visiting professor at Yale in 1977, 1980, and 1981), Eco composed Art and Beauty in the Middle Ages when he was only 26 years old. But even at that age he clearly seems to have had a full understanding of his subject matter. He moves freely and confidently from the theology of St. Augustine to the humanism of Erasmus, revealing fascinating transitions in medieval aesthetics. But he never fully explores them.

Precisely because Eco's knowledge is so vast, the reader expects much more than mere glimpses of significant figures and finishes the book somewhat unsatisfied. Perhaps the central problem that all writers who attempt to survey the Middle Ages (or indeed any age of history) must face is a fundamental conceptual question: was the medieval period an age unified in its thought and culture or was it a more pluralistic age filled with the diversity of ideas and values we experience in the twentieth century? To put it another way, was there a "medieval man," a characteristic figure (or composite of figures) who represents or epitomizes that particular time of history, or were the patterns of life and thought too diverse to be grasped through one typological reference point? The answer to these questions determines whether the scholar interprets the Middle Ages as a distinctive period in human history with special approaches to human existence or simply as a conceptually useful, but not unique, division in the unbroken development of human affairs.

Eco employs the term "the Medievals" throughout the book referring primarily to Scholastic theologians (and, as he reveals, art critics) but also to medieval people in general. He sees a unity in the thought of the period derived from the fundamental importance of Sacred Scripture, the inheritance from Antiquity, and Christianity. Thus, by approaching the Middle Ages from this unified perspective Eco surveys an age rich in different theories and questions from a singular point of view, sometimes passing over complexities in the history of ideas. Consequently, the great variety of arguments he himself presents seems to contradict his unified perspective.


He discusses, for example, several theories on the relationship between art and religion. The Council of Nicea in 787 rejected


When the medieval mystic turned away from earthly beauty he took refuge in the Scriptures and in the contemplative enjoyment of the inner rhythms of a soul in the state of grace. Some authorities speak of a 'Socratic' aesthetics of the Cistercians, one founded upon the contemplation of the beauty of the soul. 'Interior beauty', wrote St. Bernard, 'is more comely than external ornament, more even the pomp of kings'.7 The bodies of martyrs were repulsive to look upon after their tortures, yet they shone with a brilliant interior beauty.

The contrast between external and internal beauty was a recurrent theme in medieval thought. There was also a sense of melancholy, because of the transience of earthly beauty. Boethius is a moving example, lamenting on the very threshold of death, 'The beauty of things is fleet and swift, more fugitive than the passing of flowers in Spring . . . 'â€¢ This is an aesthetic variation on the moralistic theme of ubi sunt, a constant theme in medieval culture: where are the great of yesteryear, where are the magnificent cities, the riches of the proud, the works of the mighty?
