person my age, I had a good salary, 
but that was it. It wouldn't have been a 
great salary for me at 40." 
Sample's professional considerations 
usually don't apply to the men in the 
program, who tend to enroll at an 
older age. When John Murray applied 
to Yale, he had an established dental 
practice in Greenwich, CT. He had 
never finished his BA degree, having 
been accepted early into dental school 
because of the great demand for 
doctors and dentists after the Second 
World War. "Before I got into this," he 
says, "I felt I was in a cultural rut, I felt 
I was working and supporting my 
family and I wasn't expanding." He 
never planned to leave dentistry, but at 
62 he talks about a career change. "I'm 
much more interested in what goes on 
around me. I used to read the front 
page of the newspaper and think I 
couldn't do anything about that. But 
now I think I can do something, and 
I'm particularly interested in world 
hunger. I might get a master's degree 
in public health, the point being to 
contribute something to the children, 
to give something back," he says. 
Murray compares his current goals

to those of his son, who graduated 
college last year. In this case, the older 
Murray possesses the idealism, while 
the younger Murray looked for a job in 
banking. But with fewer worries about 
his financial security, Murray says he 
feels freer to pursue a lower-paying 
job, as well as an education at Yale. 
According 
to Cynthia 
Russett, 
a 
lecturer in history who served on a 
recent faculty committee reviewing the 
program, one of the greatest problems 
among Special· Students is the lack of 
any financial aid. The committee 
ran a survey among special students to 
help evaluate the program. "It was 
really quite touching to read about 
some of the financial sacrifice that's 
going on," Russett says. "Some of them 
were stretched to the very limit, and 
some .of them were saying, 'I'm 
drowning, I'm ·going to drop out.'" . 
Next month the general faculty will 
hear the committee report on the 
program and may implement a form of 
tinancial aid. Hut some may op-
pose 
giving assistance 
to 
Special 
Students 
if it taps 
into tradi-
tional undergraduate funds, "It's got to 
come out of the pocket of the regular 
undergrads," Blum says, "and 
it becomes very difficult to draw the 
line. I think financial aid should only 
be offered 
employees of the 
university." Betty T rachtenberg, 
director of admissions for the program, 
also wants to preserve undergraduate 
funds, but she thinks aid for Special 
Students can be found in "creative 
ways." Recognizing that a lack of aid 
limits the variety of older students who 
can attend Yale, she sees a real need 
for the current policy to change. 
"Minority students are not represented 
in the program. I think the lack of 
financial aid may be a factor, though 
it does 
not give 
complete 
explanation," she says. 
While the $980 tuition per course 
contributes to keeping some students 
away from Yale, others can afford to 
come but must continue working full-
time. Thea Guidone, a member of this 
year's freshman class, has a job as a 
facilitator in management and union 
discussions at Southern New England 
Telephone. The phone company 
reimburses her for any courses she 
takes in which she receives an A or a B, 
and her family does not lose her 
income to tuition costs. But at the same 
time that working helps Guidone to 
stay in school, it makes her schedule 
considerably more difficult to manage. 
During the phone company's strike last 
fall, she worked ten-hour days, six 
days a week while taking two courses. 
She explains that working not only 
tires her but keeps her from feeling 
relaxed among other undergraduates. 


"Part of the reason I feel older than 
everyone else is because of the clothes I 
wear from 
work," she says. 
"In 
Women's Studies, the teacher would 
mention the vJoman with the tennis 
shoes and briefcase, and I would be 
wearing tennis shoes and have a 
briefcase. I felt like I stuck out like a 
sore thumb." 
Even for Special Students who don't 
work, class situations may make them 
feel 
separate from 
the 
main 
community at Yale. Sample says she 
feels students view her as someone who 
could have taught them high school 
algebra. Before class, wearing a red 
sweater and jeans, she talks about 
looking different. "Behind my eyes is 
the same person that I was at their age, 
but I don't think they see that person. 
Yes, 
I've 
obviously had more 
experiences, but I never think about 
that. The changes are so gradual, you 
see yourself as one continuous person. 
It doesn't change your ability to be a 
friend, to have a conversation." Like 
Sample, 
Graham 
also 
remembers 
looking different in the eyes of her 
younger classmates. "I was always 
early," she says, "and no matter how 
crowded the class became, there were 
always empty seats beside me. They 
always left me room." 
At the same time that Special 
Students feel one kind of isolation on 
the Yale campus, they feel a different 
kind when they go home. For many of 
them, "the ride over" means more than 
20 minutes on the highway, a few 
traffic lights and parking in the city. It

That's very good, it

and we can run the 
world.'" 


means shifting points of view. "About 
halfway here, I get into the student 
mode," Sample says. "I don't talk about 
my husband, my son, my read ing 
groups anymore. And then, later on 
the way home, after a certain point, I 
start thinking about the laundry, I 
start thinking about my husband ." 
As a film student, Sample finds 
screening times inconvenient, and she 
relies on her family 
make 
adj ustments. "It's very hard to find a 
babysitter who 
will stay on 
Wednesday night until 1 o'clock in the 
morning," she says. To enable her to 
watch films in the afternoon, her 
husband arranges his schedule to work 
at home one day a week. In addition, 
the family as a whole accepts changes 
resulting from demands on Sample's 
time. "I think I rely on my husband 
and my son more to be able to come up 
with meals. They eat hot dogs now, 
and we fix things quicker, and they 
don't complain. I think a lot of times 
the guilt is self-imposed tha~ I'm not 
doing enough. They never say that." 
Outside her family, Sample.says she 
finds support among her peers~ · but not 
in the form of conversations about her 
work or her struggle to stay in school. 
"M y very best friend found ou t she was 
pregnant when I got into school, and 
she realized it meant as much to me as 
that did to her. She was happy for me, 
even though she didn't 
unrl~rstand 
it," Sample says. She finds that men 
don't always take her seriously. "Most 
of the men in my community are for it, 
but occasionally I'll run into someone 
saying 'That's nice, dear. That's very 
good, it will keep you busy, and we can 
run the world."' 
Difficulties in integrating the 
various parts of their lives create a 
common ground for conversation 
among Special Students, but few 
channels exist for them to get to know 
each other. Although entering 
members of each class are affiliated 
with the same residential college, many 
don't have time for regular meals, and 
they miss the chance to talk to people 
who can readily identify with them. 
Russett says that man y
