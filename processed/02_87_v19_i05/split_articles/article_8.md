The six ftlm societies on campus 
provide weekend entertainment, 
sometimes even with subtitles. Yet the 
preponderance of films screened here 
are directed by whites and backed by 
major distributors. Valarie Hartman 
and Mikal Muharrar, both graduate 
students in American Studies, decided 
in the fallÂ· of 1986 to create an 
alternative. 

Along with 20 other 
graduate students, 
undergraduates 
and community members, 
they 
formed 
the Mumbo Jumbo 
film 
society, 
dedicated to 
presenting 
independent films created by Afro-, 
Asian-, 
and Hispanic-American 
directors. These movies, rarely shown 
in commercial movie theaters, are 
often ignored even by traditional 
independent 
outlets whose 
primary focus 
non-Hollywood 
cinema. 

"There are a number of art houses 
and museums that are designed to 
provide 
space 
for 
cinema, and even there, there are only 
token representations of Third World 
cinema," Hartman said. The Museum 
of Modern Art and the Guggenheim 
Museum in New York City frequently 
present movies that are created by 
non-traditional filmmakers. 
But 
according 
Muharrar, 
marginalization of Third World films 
by a 
predominantly Eurocentric 
industry results in their being 
overlooked 
by 
these art 
houses. 

In addition to providing exposure to 
Third World cinema, the members of 
Mumbo Jumbo hope to accompany 
the films with panels led by the 
filmmakers 
themselves. In these 
discussions 
directors would 
examine the political economy of 
independent cinema, and explore 
questions of representation in clas-
sical Hollywood film. Because the 
filmmakers have varied political and 
aesthetic opinions, they would also 
debate among themselves the validity 
of different cinematic approaches. The 
first Mumbo Jumbo screening, pre-
sented February 26 at the 
Yale 
University Art Gallery, displayed this 
diversity. Michelle Parkerson's movi~ 
.... but then, she's Betty Carter, which 
examines the life of jazz singer Carter, 
follows a standard documentary film 
style. Larry Clark's Passing Through, on 
the other hand, 
exemplifies an 
experimental approach which Hart-
man feels may prove inaccessible to the 
average movie-goer. "Their films are 
very different." Hartman said, and the 
panel will address these differences as 
well as the common problems of Third 
World filmmakers. 

In order to fund their ambitious 
agenda, the members of Mumbo 
Jumbo approached various organi-
zations for suonort. The Afro-
American Studies.a'nd Women's Studies 
Departments have donated some funds 
to the society, and a number of other 
groups, including the Black Students 
Association at 
Yale, 
the Afro-
American Cultural Center, and the 
Connecticut Council for the Arts, have 
also contributed. However, Mumbo 
Jumbo still operates under a number of 
financial difficulties due to the high 
costs of film rentals, which can average 
as much as $200 per movie. Because of 
such constraints, the members of the 
society only scheduled six fUms for this 
semester, 
with 
the intention of 
continuing the program next year. 

Future screenings this year will take 
place at Davies Auditorium, beginning 
in March. Some of the films scheduled 
for presentation include I Be Done, Been 
Was Is. about the lives of black women 
comedians, and Bush Mama, which 
examines the life of a welfare recipient 
living in the Watts community of Los 
Angeles. Hartman hopes to be able to 
present these and other movies at the 
Dixwell Community House, as well as 
at Yale. "Lots of people in the New 
H aven community come out to see 
black 
films," Hartman 
said. 
For 
example, She's Cotta Have It, Spike Lee's 
film about several black Brooklynites, 
drew a large part of its audience from 
people who live in New Haven and 
who are not associated with Yale 
University. Because of such interest, 
the members of Mumbo Jumbo have 
maintained, throughout their planning 
and development, 
commitment 
toward exposing their films to local 
New Haven residents. 

The response and financial support 
elicited so far indicate that interest in 
Mumbo Jumbo 
will 
be great. 
Hartman and Muharrar do not believe 
that black and Third World directors 
will enjoy widespread distribution for a 
long time to come, but at least here in 
New Haven they will be assured an 
audience.
