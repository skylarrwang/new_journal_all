"Perplexed is good," Ethan Klingsberg 
(Law '90) said of one reaction to the ·new 
magazine he helped to found, Interrupt 
Now. Perplexed makes sense, too. The 
magazine, which Klingsbcrg and his 
friends simply xeroxed and stapled 
together, is a riot of collage graphics 
and 
typed 
writing, 
all 
careening 
together in hlack and white. Sold in 
New York, New Haven, and Wash-
ington, D.C., it contains a number of 
writings about music, but also some on 
politics, sex, and how to make a peanut . 
butter and sardine sandwich. Any 
general 
theme?· "Great moments," 
Klingsberg suggested. 

The magazine's musical bent may 
stem from Klingsberg's past; ·he once 
belonged to a band called Fascist .Julio 
the Stranded .Jellyfish. 
In 
addition, most of his own contri-
butions to the magazine are leftovers 
from his stint last year as a staff writer 
for two alternative music publications 
in England. "On the side, everyone 
was putting things out on their own," 
he recalled. "I was just really impressed 
by the creativity of the magazines they 
published 
that inspired . me." 

During his first semester at Yale Law 
School this fall, Klingsberg grew bored. 
"I started writing things over just to 
free myself from the tedium." 

Included in his unpublished material 
from the previous year were several 
interviews, including one with Sonic 
Youth, a post-punk band from New 
York, and another with heavy metal 
superstars Motley Crue. Both pieces 
appear in lnle"upt Now alongside 
Klingsberg's writings on lesser-known 
bands like New Zealand's critically 
praised Chills. He stresses, however, 
that the magazine is not a one-man 
show, although initially only he and his 
friends were involved. Now, material 
comes in from outside sources as well. 

One notable contributor to the first 
issue was cult figure Henry Rollins. 
ex-lead singer for the punk band Black 
Flag. who responded to a personal 
letter from Klingsberg with a page of 
his poetry. The correspondence led to 
a highly successful benefit for Intrrrupt 
Now. organized by Klingsberg and 
sponsored by WYBC. At the show, 
Rollins performed his "Spoken Trip," a 
comedy act of sorts. and underground 
filmmaker Nick Zcdd, noted for "Geek 
Maggot Bingo," showed some of his 
short movies. 

The multimedia format befitted a 
benefit for lnte"upt Now which, in 
addition 
music-related 
pieces, 
included short stories. many photos, 
and a healthy quotient of free-form 
ramblings, plus one by Klingsberg 
which posits, "Reagan is disguised as 
Andy Warhol. So is Andy Warhol, I 
suspect." Klingsberg hopes that Inter-
rupt Now is not perceived solely as a 
music magazine, nor as one concerned 
with the "New Haven scene." He 
expressed distaste for the typical locally 
based U.S. fanzine, which he claims is 
usually the work of high . school 
students. "Most of them are just about 
how life sucks because they're in high 
. school. And they interview a couple of 
other angry high school bands," he 
snorted. "That never really turned me 
on." Klingsberg also attacked the 
tendencies of many music magazines 
either to insult every band they 
mention or to gush with constant 
praise. 

Klingsberg sees lntmupt Now as 
closer in style to the publications he 
admired in England, although he 
added, grinning, "It's more erotic . 
The English magazines were kind of 
repressed. This isn't." Hardly. The 
first long piece in issue #1, "No 
Reproduction Permitted," consists of a 
graphic depiction of sexual violence, 
supposedly written by "several inmates 
at a local prison on the Jersey Shore." 

The story's content could easily offend 
the average reader, but Klingsberg 
looked confused at this suggestion. "I 
mean, it totally depends on who you 
read," he said. He did admit the 
importance of not letting the whole

publication rely on the shock value of 
that first piece, if simply for the sake of 
variety. 

The audience for a publication like 
Interrupt Now may be hard to reach. 
Klingsberg, who sees his buyers as 
primarily music fans , has concentrated 
his sales efforts on small alternative 
music stores like New Haven's Rhymes 
Records. 

The magazine lacks 
a 
distributor, though, and fewer than 
200 copies of the first issue were 
printed. Klingsberg claims he "doesn't 
really care." He is excited about future 
issues, and may change the name of 
the publication for each one. The next 
is 
tentatively titled 
Vulnerable. 
"Everything is vulnerable," 
he 
explained. 

The statement reflects Klingsberg's 
belief in the wide scope of his 
publication. He also mentioned some 
modern novelists who write in a 
stream-of-consciousness style; 
while 
reading their work, he claims, "You 
realize, I could do this, I have this 
whole file of things. Everybody has a 
file. I'd show Interrupt Now to· people 
and they'd run upstairs and grab stuff 
and say 'Look at this, look .at this' 
. . . That's the best part." lntm-upt Now 
does resemble a collection of found 
artifacts, although their universality is 
questionable. Still, with 
underground music scene booming, 
Klingsberg may well find his audience. 
The magazine, whether it appeals or 
not, is hard to dismiss.
