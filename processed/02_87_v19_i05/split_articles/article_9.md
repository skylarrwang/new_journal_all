John Sylvain (TD '87) stands to lose his dining hall position. 

Some students live from day to day 
and year to year at Yale never 
worrying about the cost of their 
education. 

Though 
projected 
tuition, room and board for next year, 
$17,020, may interest or even shock 
those students, it probably doesn't 
scare them. But 35 percent of Yale 
undergraduates receive scholarship aid 
from the University, and many of 
them are worried. The government 
and Yale have tightened their financial 
aid policy and students are beginning 
to feel their grip. "I'm being paid close 
attention by the Financial Aid Office 
and Bursar's Office. I was told I could 
earn 98 more dollars for the rest of the 
year," john Sylvain (TD '87) said. 

Most Yale financial aid packages 
consist of a 
scholarship and 
"self-help"-a loan and/or a job. This 
plan limits income from on-campus 
jobs by imposing an earnings ceiling 
which varies for each student. The 
6 The New Journal/February 27, 1987 
catch is that when students exceed their 
ceilings, their scholarships decrease the 
next year. Jaqueline Foster, Director 
of the Undergraduate Financial Aid 
Office (UFAO) explained the 
reasoning behind this policy: "If you 
make more than the loan- and job-
allotted amount, then you have more 
money than you have need for. If you'll 
be in a job in which you're making 
$6000 then we would give you less 
scholarship because you'll need less 
scholarship." 

But many financial aid students 
question a system which penalizes 
them for working hard. "The basic 
paradox is that if you're on financial 
aid and you need the money then you 
can't work, and if you're not on 
financial aid and don't need the 
money, then you can work as much as 
you want," Sylvain explained. Sylvain, 
a TD dining hall student coordinator, 
pays S200 per month from his earnings 
'. 
toward his tuition. But though he needs 
his job to pay Yale's bill and stay at 
school, the UF AO has asked him to 
stop ~orking. Sylvain's situation reflects 
the UFAO's current difficulties in 
reconciling students' needs with Yale's 
changing approach to financial aid. 

Although earning ceilings for 
financial aid students have existed for 
years, they never caused a problem 
until recently. Students have gone over 
their limits in the past without fear 
because the UF AO did not pay close 
attention to their earnings. But this 
year a new computer system has made 
student incomes easier to supervise. In 
addition, recent amendments to the 
Higher Education Act of 1965 have 
placed tighter federal 
controls on 
financial aid policy. Foster reported 
that the Department of Education now 
requires 
UF AO to monitor 
students' on-campus earnings more 
strictly. As a 
result, students are
