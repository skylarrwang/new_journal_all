To the Editor: 
I was pleased to read Martha Brant's 
article on Objectivism, Shrugging Off 
Convention (TN}, January 30, 1987), 
and appreciated both its relatively 
successful effort to portray Objectivism 
objectively, as it were, and to refrain 
from 
the 
gratuitous 
conservative-
bashing and POR-bashing one 
unfortunately sometimes finds in the 
public discourse of this campus. I was 
also quite 
pleased 
to 
be quoted 
correctly. 

I fear, however, that an important 
distinction I made in the course of my 
conversation with MiÂ·ss Brant was not 
entirely clear from the naturally small 
portion of our discussion 
which 
appeared in the article as printed. That 
distinction was between my opinions, 
as an individual, of Objectivism and 
Objectivists as members of the Party of 
the Right. My distaste for the potential 
dogmatism of Objectivism and the real 
dogmatism of some Objectivists leads 
naturally, if seemingly paradoxically, 
to my belief that the Party of the Right 
is good for its Objectivist members and 
they for it. The reason f()r this is that 
an O~jectivist, or anyone else, so 
wrapped up in dogma as to be unable 
to stand having his beliefs challenged 
long and hard will not enjoy the POR 
and will not stick around very long. 

Over the years, some people have 
entered the Party as Objectivists and 
left as something else. Others have 
entered as something else and left as 
Objectivists. All have gone through the 
crucible of self-examination toward 
personal growth that we hold to be the 
essence of the Party of the Right and, 
by vigorously arguing for their ideas, 
have contributed to the intellectual 
growth of others in the Party. Thus, 
while "Within the Party, good-natured 
disagreement exists," although 
"courteously violent" might be a better 
phrase, I must disagree with the 
sen tence preceding that one, that 
"Students in the POR do not always 
welcome 
this support 
objectivist element." 

Faithfully yours, 
John Wood Brewer, SM '87 
Chairman, The Party of the Right
