EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Iconoclasm and allowed the use of 
sacred images. But were these artistic 
representations of Biblical figures 
subordinate to the Church's teachings, 
or could they exist independently? Eco 
lists several medieval answers to this 
question but provides no satisfactory 
analysis of the similarities and 
differences among the "Medie-
vals" 
themselves or between 
tne 
"Medievals" and people of different 
ages. Such a comparison is necessary 
in order to clarify the significance of 
the term "Medievals." Unfortunately, 
the limitations of a chapter in a 
handbook do not allow Eco the 
opportunity to engage in such critical 
synthesis. 


Indeed , 
the book, 
rich 
and 
exhaustive in its scope, suffers from a 
lack of framework. 
Divided 
into 
chapters such as the "Aesthetics of 
Proportion," the "Aesthetics of Light," 
â€¢symbol and Allegory," and "Theories 
of Art," the work lacks a superstructure 
other than the unity provided by the 
rnedieval time period. The passages 
where Eco begins 
to bring out 
COntrasts and tensions in these diverse 
approaches to art and beauty are not 
developed as fully as they need to be in 
: order to unify the book. He hints at, 
1. but never properly draws out, the 
~ parallels he discovers between the 
l "Medievals" and important thinkers of 
:5 other periods. He begins to advance, 
-! for example, arguments about the 
; similarity between the dynamic 
~ conceptions of contemplation shared 
8 by the Romantics and the neo-Platonic 
school of St. Victor. He suggests that 
these disparate intellectual movements 
both exhibit a "sense of the inadequacy 
of earthly beauty, which provokes in 
hirn who contemplates it that sense of 
dissatisfaction which is a form of 
yearning for God." Such synthetic 
analysis is often the most exciting and 
rewarding 
aspect 
of 
any 
comprehensive survey. 


Had 
he 
included more of these, or dedicated 
more pages to these insights, the 
published volume would be a first-rate 
book and not a chapter. 


Eco seeks in his conclusion to unite 
the various themes from 
the 
preceding chapters by outlining the 
transitions from one medieval theory 
of beauty to another. From 
Pythagorean theory of numbers to the 
struggle between Scholastic universal 
order and secular independence, he 
sketches the history of aesthetics from 
the reaction against the disorder and 
chaos following the fall of Rome to the 
Renaissance. 


This fascinating 
historical survey provides some order 
to the work as a whole but cannot 
succeed in uniting the previous 100 
pages. The topical (as opposed to 
chronological) approach, which Eco 
employs throughout most of the book, 
surveys the issues too briefly to allow 
the reader to retain any sense of 
specific figures or to develop any 
synthetic capacity to connect the 
chapters. The diversity of medieval 
thought, the categorized subjects of 
inquiry, and the brief account of 
changes in theory are the general 
concepts that remain in the mind. Eco 
presents the extensive and diverse 
source material (he draws on painting, 
literature, architecture, 
theology, 
poetry, and Church councils) too 
succinctly for the individual authors 
and artists to become clear and distinct 
in the reader's understanding. 


Eco 
attempts 
to survey eleven 
centuries of thought in 120 pages, a 
project both laudable and neces-
sary -laudable because the skills and 
scholarship (which Eco clearly has) 
required to attempt the project are 
immense, 
and necessary because 
understanding any particular idea 
requires 
an understanding of its 
predecessors and descendants. 


Unfortunately, the book should have 
been at least twice as long and more 
thorough 
to al.ow Eco's scholarly 
insights to provide the kind of synthesis 
required for a short history.
