paying closer attention to the running

These figures and occasional warnings 
from employers are 
the only 
notifications that students are 
approaching their earning limits and 
may have to quit their jobs. 

Rather than jeopardize their 
scholarships in order to work, many 
students will leave their jobs unless the 
UFAO raises their earning ceilings. 

The threat of student workers suddenly 
quitting worries other staff members. 

Maureen Sullivan, head of Library 
Personnel, said, "Students are being 
notified that they have to stop working. 
This is causing a real problem for the 
supervisors because not only are they 
faced with not having someone to 
work, but they've developed 
a 
relationship with the student and care 
about the student 
as 
per-
son." Jonathan Warren (BR '88), who 
works at Sterling· Memorial Library, 
recalled learning that he would either 
have to quit his job or risk 
scholarship cut. "I work in the inter-
library loan office. Seniors are starting 
to come in like mad and the library 
really needs people, but I said, "Listen, 
if they (the UFAO) don't increase my 
ceiling, I'm leaving- I'm not ~orking 
here for free." Strict 
adhei.~nce to 
earning ceilings threatens to be most 
disruptive in the dining halls, where 
student workers earn the highest wages 
on campus and work long hours. 

Dining Hall managers are particularly 
vulnerable to exceeding their ceilings, 
because they make about eight dollars 
an hour and work at least ten hours per 
week. 

The UFAO has 
tried 
to 
find 
loopholes in the system to help students 
keep their campus jobs. Financial aid 
officers send their students through 
two routes to try to get their ceilings 
raised. First, a student can claim to 
have additional expense items which 
would 
warrant 
higher 
budget. 

According to Foster, "When somebody 
has earned more than they were 
supposed to, you can see if they had 
any additional expenses that weren't 
acknowleged in the standard budget. 
So we ask something like, "Does it cost 
you more money to travel than we 
allotted you?" In addition, students can 
claim to have a summer deficiency. 

The UF AO requires financial aid 
students to make about $1,400 over the 
summer, but if they do not make this 
much, the UFAO will often raise their 
ceiling. 

Both strategies to raise the earnings 
ceiling involve a fairly simple process, 
requiring no financial proof but only 
an 
occasional explanation. 

After 
learning that he would have to quit his 
job at the library, Warren went to the 
UFAO: "I walked into the Financial 
Aid office and said, 'What do I have to 
do to increase my ceiling?' They said 
'Do you have a summer savings 
deficiency? That's how we usually get 
around this problem. If you didn't 
make as much this summer as you 
were supposed to, you're allowed to 
make it up during the term.' So I said, 
'Oh, no I didn't,' and I filled out tht> 
form." The Financial Aid Office can't 
tell students to lie, but according to 
Sylvain, "People lie about it. You need 
to." 

But lying doesn't always work, and 
not all students can justify a sufficient 
earnings ceiling by declaring a summer 
deficiency or additional 
expenses.

daiminj.{ extra

for

However, this increase is not enough 
and she has exhausted the UF AO's 
options. By spring break she will have 
passed the new ceiling and will have to 
quit her job. She lives off the money 
that she earns and her only option may

be to work off-campus. "I put in one 
application for an off-campus job, but 
they don't seem too eager to hire Yale 
students," she said. Some students 
have 
turned 
off-campus jobs 
because the UFAO cannot keep track 
of earnings outside the University. But 
this strategy almost always results in 
lower wages and less flexible hours. In 
going off-campus to work, David 
Collin (TD '90) took a $2.50 pay cut. 

For some, resolving their earnings 
ceiling conflict will determine whether 
they remain at Yale. Sylvain's case has 
gone before a financial aid committee 
which 
will 
determine his 
fate. 

Examining such cases may encourage 
the UFAO to revise the current 
financial aid policy rather than to 
continue to rely on loopholes. Given 
the 
existing system, 
more com-
munication among financial aid 
officers, 
campus 
employers and 
students might prevent further 
disruption 
and 
worry. 

For 
now, 
financial aid students need to be 
conscious of Yale's clampdown, or at 
least to pay closer attention to the 
numbers on their pay check stubs.
