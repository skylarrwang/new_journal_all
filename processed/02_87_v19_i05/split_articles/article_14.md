much on the practical considerations of 
assigning building space or changing 
words, 
but on 
the 
philosophical 
considerations of what teaching Special 
Students means. These considerations 
don't stop at the gains for the Special 
Students themselves. In her experience 
teaching history, Russett finds that 
older students add a valuable per-
spective to discussion. "They are the 
only ones who can have a developed 
sense of social change, and social 
change is what history is all about," she 
says. "It keeps students from feeling 
that it was all inevitable, to give them a 
sense of the person and the struggle, of 
the time when maybe it didn't seem 
things would change- that history isn't 
just a smooth progression." 

In one of his classes, 
Murray 
remembers a time when he provided 
much of the input for a discussion on 
American politics. "We were studying 
the Cuban confrontation 
in 
Kennedy administration. The con-
ference was in a 
building across 
campus. I was ten minutes late, and 
when I walked in, a boy jumped up 
and said, 'Dr. Murray, what are you 
doing here?' H e was a patient of mine. 
Then the TA said, 'I wasn't here 
during the Cuban Missile Crisis, but 
you were. Tell us about it.'" 

In evaluating the program, Yale 
must also think about its general 
purpose in education, and the ways 
Special Students as individuals value a 
degree. "All I asked my professors was 
to assume that I was there like anyone 
else, to learn," Grah am says. She 
found 
that this assumption was 
sometimes denied. "I was planning lO 
go to England to study for the summer, 
and this professor said, 'Well, Beverly, 
how are you going to go to England for 
three 
months? 
Don't you 
have 
children? Don't you have a husband?' I 
said to him, 'I don't think you 
understand how important it is to me 
to be at Yale,' and tears were in my 
eyes. After that things were better." 

She spent the summer in England.
