Shrugging Off 
Convention 
Martha Brant 
Arthur Rubin (CC, '89) loves to talk 
about politics, but during his two years 
at Yale, the fast talking, aggressive 
sophomore has had a hard time finding 
people who will listen. "I find the 
political climate at Yale a little bit 
oppressive; people don't really listen to 
what I have to say," he said. "A lot of 
the conservatives d ismiss my views as 
being kind of wacko and the left can't 
stand me." This philosophy · which 
Rubin claims has earned such enmity 
from 
both 
sides of the 
political 
s p ec t rum- objectivism.:_ was 
developed by author Ayn Rand in the 
1940's and has enjoyed limited but 
consistent support ever since. Rand's 
death in 1982 and the subsequent 
reprinting of much of her work have 
sparked 
a 
renewed 
interest in 
objectivism. 
In 
D ecember,1985, 
Rubin and several other students 
formed the Objectivism Study Group 
at Yale, dedicated to defending and 
preserving 
R and's unique 
but 
controversial philosophy. 
There have been objectivists at Yale 
since the height of R and's popularity in 
the late 1950's. During that time 
students created objectivism discussion 
clubs on many college campuses; other 
Randians circulated taped lectures and 
subscribed to objectivist publications. 
Much of this activity exists at Yale 
today. T he current study group meets 
for dinner about every other week, 
primarily 
to 
discuss the 
applications of the philosophy. These 
dinner meetings usually include three 
or four avid objectivists, a few main-
stream conservative stragglers, and 
occasionally some liberals eager for 
argument. The study group has also 
invited editors of objectivist 
publications to give speeches and has 
tried to add an objectivist seminar to 
the curriculum, an idea which Director 
of Undergraduate Studies of Philos-
ophy, R.I.G. Hughs, rejected, calling 
the philosophy "disreputable." 
Rand presented objectivism in her 
two best- selling novels, 
The 
Fountainhead ( 1943) and Atlas Shrugged 
(1957), as well as in her other fiction 
and non-fiction essays. She arranged 
her philosophy into four strands: 
metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and 
politics. Rand summarized the meta-
physical strain 
in 
her statement, 
"existence exists." Objectivism is based 
on the assumption that humankind can 
understand the world through rational 
thought. Thus Rand's epistemology -
her theory of the 
nature of 
knowledge-centers on reason. The 
character John Galt in Atlas Shrugged 
best explains the objectivist ethic: "I 
swear- by my life and my love of 
it- that I will never live for the sake of 
another man, nor ask another man to 
live for mine." Rand's political vision 
includes 
limited government 
structure and 
pure laissez-faire 
capitalism. 


Although this philosophical outline 
does not prescribe any specific political 
affiliation, most active objectivists at 
Yale are also members of the Party of 
J I 
Ayn Rand, who gained international 
attention for 
h er controversial 
philosophy. 
"I swear-by my life 
and my love of 
it- that I will never 
live for the sake of 
another man, nor ask 
another man to live 
for mine." 
the Right (POR). T here have been 
objectivists in the POR since the 
founding of the party in the early 
1950's. 

Although objectivists have 
always been a minority, they are very 
active in party leadership. 

Both R ubin, just elected Secre-
tary/Treasurer, and the previous party 
chairman, Todd Lencz (SM, '89), try 
to follow Rand's theories, explaining 
that objectivists do not fit the standard 
"conservative" label 
but feel 
comfortable in the PO R because it 
espouses no official doctrine and serves 
as a debating society. Objectivists 
accept some political philosophies from 
each end of the political spectrum. On 
the one hand, they agree with the left's 
fight 
for 
civil 
liberties and 
its 
denunciati.on of state- imposed 
morality, while also supporting the 
right's firm defense of property rights 
and capitalism. If forced to classify 
themselves 
politically, 
objectivists 
generally refer to themselves as right 
wing because of their overriding 
commitment to capitalism. 

Students in the POR do not always 
welcome 
this 
support 
from the 
objectivist element. Within the party, 
good-natured disagreement exists. 
John Brewer (SM, '87), the newly 
elected chairman of the POR 
exclaimed, "I'm not a Randhead, not 
The New J ournal/january 30, 1987 5 
f 
§ 

me." His brown hair hanging well 
below his shoulders, Brewer proudly 
pointed out that both he and Rubin 
have a pierced ear- it is the first time 
in the history of the party that two of its 
leading members wear an earring. 
"The POR is not an ideologically 
monolithic group," Brewer said, "but 
one of the problems with objectivists in 
general and in dealing with them is 
that theirs is a very dogmatic system 
although it claims to be completely 
rational." 

Objectivists like to take advantage of 
any opportunity to 
challenge 
traditional conservative views within 
the POR. Rubin for one has become 
frustrated with the complexities he 
finds in conservatism: "Conservatism 
as 
whole 
is 
mass 
of 
contradictions- it's terrible." The new 
religious right, for example, appalls 
him: "Religion is the key problem with 
conservatism. 
Because of their 
religious beliefs, conservatives seem to 
think that their morality is the right 
morality and they should legislate it to 
us." Religious faith is contrary to 
Randian thought and the objectivists 
strongly 
oppose alliances between 
religion and politics. 

In fact, objectivists oppose 
government intervention in the realm 
of any moral issue. They abhor the 
Reagan Administration's anti-abortion 
position as well as much of its Third 
World policy against 
communism. 
Rubin said that "the United States' 
objective in foreign policy should be 
the protection of human rights. I think 
it was wrong for the United States to 
support the Shah, 
Battista, 
and 
Somoza (military dictators in Iran, 
Cuba, and Nicaragua) because we fail 
to see the forest through the trees. The 
primary concern we 
should have 
should be the protection of human 
rights. If the United States supports a 
government just because it is anti-
communist, but disregards human 
rights, then we seem to have missed 
the point." Although this idea seems 
similar to liberal beliefs, it is not rooted 
in the same philosophy. By objectivist 
standards, 
communism 
is not a 
legitimate governmental system since

philosophy: "If 
is not, it's a fascist. 
it suppresses individual rights. 

Although 
VIew 
communism as "evil," they feel that 
American foreign 
policy makers 
should 
formulate 
policies 
more 
sensitive to human rights violations 
than 
to hypothetical communist 
infiltration. 

Despite the apparent similarities be-
tween some objectivist and standard 
liberal views, Rubin claimed, "Most 
liberal Yalies don't have much interest 
in the Objectivism Study Group. 
People don't know what it is but will 
criticize it anyway. They say, 'Oh, 
Ayn Rand's a fascist.' For Christ's 
sake, if there is anything she is not, it's 
a fascist." Robert Larsen (BK, '87), 
former Liberal Party Chairman and 
current Vice President of the Yale 
College Democrats, speaks for one 
element of the politically active liberals 
on campus. "We are diametrically 
opposed to their beliefs. Objectivists 
have one big solution which they hope 
solves problems instead of dealing with 
the problems. Liberals have a more 
realistic outlook." Rubin disagreed, 
arguing that objectivism does in fact 
provide the tools to find realistic 
answers in a complex world. "The 
biggest thing you'll come 
across, 
. especially at a place like Yale which is 
pretty liberal, is what Rand called the

'cult of moral greyness'-everything is 
grey, there is no right and wrong, 
everything is r~Jative. Sometimes an 
issue is pretty tough to judge and there 
are grey areas, but we believe that 
there is right and wrong, there is good 
and evil, there is black and white." 

Associate Philosophy Professor John 
Fischer and other philosophers 
challenge that clear division. "I think it 
· is fair to say that most philosophers 
reject this as an oversimplified view of 
the world," Fischer said. Although not 
a Randian expert, Fischer is very 
familiar with libertarianism, a branch 
of conservatism with some similarities 
to objectivism. He does not dismiss 
objectivism outright as 
many 
philosophers do, but does debate its 
reasoning. In his peaceful office in SSS 
overlooking the Long Island Sound, 
Fischer explained, "Many philosophers 
believe that the only way in which 
objectivism is plausible is to make 
assumptions that are naive and 
unrealistic." 

Objectivists and mainstream 
philosophers differ fundamentally on 
issues concerning human nature and 
on the political role of government. 
Objectivists believe that 
social 
programs are immoral. They argue 
that such programs reduce incentive 
and create a 
cycle of welfare 
generations. "The government is not 
the babysitter of the people," said 
Rubin. Objectivists would like to 
dismantle public policy programs such

as the welfare system, even if such a 
project required several decades to 
complete. "Ideally, 
private charity 
should and I think would take care of 
the people that are on welfare :·now," 
said Rubin. "Back when we had less 
welfare, more people gave to private 
charity. Basically, I believe that man is 
essentially good and that the world is a 
good place." Fischer thinks 
that 
objectivists have an overly optimistic 
view of human nature and would 
argue that, "If we just left it up to 
voluntary interaction it is probable 
that not enough people would con-
tribute. In many cases people will 
think it is fair that we have an overall 
social policy that requires a certain 
contribution and therefore they're 
willing to 
contribute given that 
everyone else does." 

According to Fischer, the optimism 
of objectivism makes the philosophy 
unique as well as easy to criticize. "It 
differs not just from socialist, marxist, 
and liberal doctrine, but even moder-
ate and some conservative doctrine in 
that objectivists don't favor a minimal 
level of 'positive' or welfare rights. 
They believe in libertarian rights or 
'negative' rights- that people 
not 
interfere with them," he said. As a 
resuit, many philosophers view objec-
tivists to be self-centered, not sensitive 
to the realities of society. Fischer 
contends that objectivists generalize 
about the human condition and fail to 
empathize with individual circum-
stances. "Objectivists tend to forget or 
deemphasize that people have special 
needs and that people are either born 
into tremendous poverty or they have 
natural handicaps and those people 
will inevitably not get very much out of 
a system which operates on Randian 
assumptions," said Fischer. 

For some objectivists, rational self-
centeredness transcends political 
philosophy to help them in their 
personal lives. "There is a certain way 
that I find objectivism very helpful as a 
woman because I really have to have 
an 'Okay, here I am, this is what I 
want and this is how I'm going to get it' 
attitude," said Dana Berliner (TD, 
'87), another member of the group. In 
her room, a copy of Atlas Shrugged lay 
open on the floor. Berliner had started 
rereading the novel one night during 
exam period and by the next day was 
almost half way through the 1168 page 
book. For Berliner, objectivism has 
provided a very organized way to think 
and live. "What it comes down to," she 
said, "is you don't let other people 
trample on you. I think that really 
helps a lot. If you think that the world 
is a rational place and you can achieve 
your goals, it is a lot easier to deal 
with." 

Berliner values the personal appli-
cations of objectivist thegry, but the 
philosophy is generally understood and 
criticized for its 
political, not its 
individual, implications. And objectiv-
ists don't mind the criticism, so long as 
it 
is well thought out. 
Several 
objectivists have said that they have 
had a difficult time finding open-
mindedness at Yale, an institution 
which they believe has a widespread 
liberal consensus and a prevailing 
dislike of conservatism. "There is too 
much knee-jerkism both on the left and 
the right, but especially on the left," 
Rubin said. "When everyone is liberal 
you kind of trip over yourself and say 
'yeah we should divest, yeah we should 
spend more money on social pro-
grams, and no nukes, and let's go sit on 
the Trident subs'- who !lives a damn 
why, everyone else is doing it! But Yale 
is not a microcosm of the real world." 

Rubin believes that most Yale students 
will be shocked to find that people in 
the 
non-academic 
world 
are less 
inclined to be liberal and that in the 
long ~:un, objectivism will provide a 
more practical outlook. Given the 
renewed interest in Rand and her 
works, perhaps objectivists will be able 
to find a more receptive audience 
outside of Yale.

At the shanty town in Leon where members of the delegation built latrines. 

When we arrived in Miami, we 
wanted to eat. We wanted to eat 
cheeseburgers. Even I, who usually 
avoid red meat, fantasized about a 
cheeseburger. We got off the plane, 
stumbled around bleary-eyed through 
the airport, and stared blankly into 
store windows. "There's just so much 
stuff here," I 
remember thinking. 

When we finally found a cafeteria-
style restaurant, I didn't know what to 
choose. After two weeks, I had been 
conditioned to having only three 
options: chicken, fish, or the old stand-
by ... rice and beans. Now the food 
seemed so colorful, so real. We piled 
up our trays, 
grabbing whatever 
looked good. Cheeseburgers, fries, 
huge Cokes, yogurt, fruit, and Dove 
bars filled every inch of table space. I 
took a stack of napkins two inches 
thick. 

I sat in that restaurant, the walls 
were some sort of orange, a couple of 
guys were playing pseudo-tropical 
music on synthesizers, and I began to 
laugh. I looked around-at the food, 
the plastic plants, the people sitting 
alone in formica cubicles- and was 
struck by the absurdity of the scene. 
But the others continued to eat, just 
staring at their plates and munching 
away. I looked at Caprice, she smiled 
and then started to giggle. Soon we 
were all laughing, 
uncontrollably, 
tears streaming down our faces. And 
just as suddenly, we stopped. 

It's been a week since that day, a week 
since we left Nicaragua. We, 15 Yale 
students, went on December 30 as part 
of the New Haven/Leon Sister City 
Project, 
a 
group committed to 
strengthening "global understanding" 
by establishing a connection with the 
people of Leon. The Project, a private 
organization run by Alan Wright,who 
graduated from Yale in December with 
a doctorate in philosophy, has involved 
2000 people, including 130 volunteers 
and four full-time staff members. The 
16th delegation in two years, this was 
the first 
to include a 
group of 
university students. With 30 members, 
it was also the largest to go to Leon 
under the Sister City Project. 

In practical terms this meant that 
students from Yale, Wesleyan, and 
Southern Connecticut, 
a nd 
New 
Haven area residents lived for either 
two or four weeks in the small city 
of Leon. 
There were originally 
two different delegations, one having 
the purpose of "fact-finding" and the 
other devoted to reconstructing the 
Museum of the Americas in Leon. Yet, 
the two groups overlapped-some of 
the students spent time building and 
many of the carpenters, architects, and 
construction people 
attended 
meetings. 

The group as a whole was, unlike 
Yale, truly "diverse." Few of the Yalies 
had known each other before, and the 
construction crew was also a mixed 
bunch. A sampling: Dave Dixon, in 
his fifties, was a graduate of the Yale 
School 
of Architecture; 
Campbell 
Dalgleish went to the Drama School 
and now teaches screenplay writing at 
NYU. A volunteer at the W halley 
Avenue 
Prison 
P oetry 
Center, 
Dalgleish wanted 
to establish 
connection between poets in the New

Haven prison and those in a prison 
located outside of Leon. 
Sandra 
Thomas is a professional photographer 
for a newspaper in Milford; Catherine 
Urbane worked on a 
film about 
Nicaraguan children intended for 
children in the US; John Bach is a 
painter who spent a total of three years 
in prison for protesting during Viet 
Nam; Dan Botkin makes hacky-sacs, 
and he made lots of them during the 
trip. And we played it everywhere- in 
airports, in the center of Leon-
everywhere. 

Leon, like New Haven, is both a 
university town and a harbor town. 
With a population of 120,000, the city 
lies about 50 miles northwest of 
Managua on the Pacific Coast. The 
streets are 
narrow and 
mostly 
unpaved. The houses are flat-roofed, 
made of either concrete or wooden 
boards nailed together- shanties. 
Graffiti, all of it political, covers the 
outer walls of houses, stores, and 
restaurants. Virtually every type of 
building has some sort of slogan, 
whether for the Liberal Independent 
party, the Marxist/Leninist party, the 
Social Christian party, 
or the 
Sandinistas (FSLN). 

In Leon, for the first couple of weeks 
the construction crew concentrated on 
restoring the roof and the staircase in 
the Museum and on bu ilding 
bookshelves for a childrens' library 
there. Cathy Cowles, a Wesleyan 
student, told me: "This is a project that 
has concrete results. We're working on 
something that's not necessarily a main 
priority of the people of Leon but a 
way of saying we believe in their 
future. That's what a museum is to 
me." When the Museum opens, one 
room will be devoted to art from New 
Haven. 

Six construction people remained in 
Nicaragua until January 19th-the 
rest of us returned on the 13th- in 
order to build latrines for a shanty 
town in Leon called "Heroes and 
Martyrs of the Calvary." Although the 
Sandinista government has given each 
family in this 200 member community 
a 
free 
plot of land 
as part of 
Nicaragua's land reform program, the 
people there cannot afford to build 
more than two latrines and two water 
pumps. The community had some 
building materials but not enough 
labor, 
so 
the construction crew 
volunteered. 

Meanwhile the other half of the 
group met with 
people and 
organizations in the Leon communi!y, 
all in an attempt to get a fuller 
political, social, and economic picture 
of the country, a picture not given in 
Hasenfus being arreated: "More than a battalion of your blond invader• baa bitten the 
dutt of my kneeling mountaina." 

the US press. We saw first-hand the 
effects of the US embargo, typified by 
a health clinic struggling to survive in 
Subtiava, an impoverished district of 
Leon. There were a handful of doctors 
responsible for an entire community, 
one broken microscope, a lack of 
supplies and space. I wondered if 
this was part of the "Nicaraguan 
juggernaut" that Reagan keeps talking 
about. 

Some of our meetings revealed the 
strengths of the country and the 
achievements of the government. The 
members 
of AMNLAE, 
the 
independent nation a l women's 
organization, were especially 
inspiring. The group's slogan this year 
is "Nobody giv~s an inch, nobody 
yields," and we quickly saw how this 
has been translated into reality, into 
the creation of a strong, influential 
women's movement in Nicaragua. 

There are now sex education programs 
in 
most high schools and 
free, 
government-subsidized day care 
centers. Eighty percent of women work 
outside the home, 
entering the 
professions of law, 
medicine and 
education in full force, and sometimes 
dominating the field. And in the new 
constitution, AMNLAE has left its 
mark: divorced men are now required 
to pay child-support and alimony, and 
women are guaranteed equal rights. 

Yet, one thing I began to notice 
about all of our meetings, whether they 
were with professors at the University 
of Leon or the women at AMNLAE, is 
the way we-as students from Yale-
asked our questions from a limited 
perspective. We'd ask about the lesbian 
and gay movement in Nicaragua or 
about the illegality of abortion, and 
we'd receive non-answers or blank 
stares. It seemed we were tacitly 
implying that the more Nicaraguans 
are like us, the better. Caprice Young, 
(MC '88), put it aptly when she told 
me, "When you ask a farmer what 
democracy is and 
he says, 'It's 
protection for my cows from the 
Contras,' the problem of conveying 
abstract ideologies becomes clear." It 
took us a while, or me at least, to

Americas with a helper. 

realize that our priorities 
weren't 
necessarily theirs. The women at 
AMNLAE told us several times that 
yes, they do want to break down 
stereotypes, but right now their main 
priority is supporting those fighting 
the Contras. Also, they still must 
contend with an age-old value 
system- many men won't even let 
their wives attend AMNLAE meetings, 
and some refuse to look after their kids 
if the wife does go. 

We also met with members of the 
government: in Leon, the mayo~· and 
the regional coordinator of the local 
FSLN, and in Managua, a National 
Assembly representative and an editor 
of the newspaper El Nuevo Diario, a 
virtual mouthpiece of the Sandinistas 
(They've got FSLN banners and 
propaganda all over their offices). 
We'd ask about the food shortages or 
about the 
philosophy of the 
Nicaraguan press and its relationship 
to 
the FSLN, and we'd receive 
responses which were either circular 
and contradictory or which completely 
brushed aside our questions as they 
launched into monologues on the 
accomplishments of the FSLN and the 
improvements the country has made 
since the Revolution (the overthrow of 
the Somoza regime in 1979). 

Yet, in talking with the people of 
Leon that we met on the street and 
those that we stayed with, I feel I did 
get a sense of the political climate of the 
country. The idea that the Sandinista 
government doesn't have popular

only one electrical outlet and carried 
buckets of water from a neighbor's 
pump each day. A stronger structure 
made of concrete blocks and mortar 
was under construction, but the family 
could not afford the cost of the labor to 
complete it, 
so 
the 
delegation 
volunteered. 
The first day of working on the 
house, things were completely 
unorganized. 
Antonio 
Lopez, 
mason in charge of the construction, 
didn't know any English, and no one 
working that day from the delegation 
could speak more than a bit of broken 
Spanish. "Antonio was really going 
bananas at first. 
He 
had 
to 
demonstrate how to mix the cement, 
how to apply the mortar, and how to 
put up the measuring poles,, Jack said. 
"We had a lot of people, and when 
everyone was finally working, it was 
really exciting. There was a huge 
group of kids from the neighborhood 
just observing us gringos." 
Despite the language barrier, we 
eventually worked out a system of 
communication with Antonio. He'd 
say "Okay!" and we'd respond with 
"Alright!" I also taught him how to give 
a "high-five," which made him smile 
but which he didn't seem to under-
stand. By the end of the morning

Since 
she 
was 
eight, 
Cathanne 
Steadman ('86) has wanted to join the 
Peace Corps. She remembers hearing 
adults speak of it in glowing terms: "It 
seemed like such a neat thing to do." 
Now much older, Steadman sits on a 
bench in the Pierson College courtyard 
two days before Yale commencement 
exercises. She pulls her light brown 
hair off of her shoulders, clasps and 
unclasps her hands, and looks around 
occasionally, 
awaiting her parents' 
arrival. How does she feel about 
graduating? "I'm terrified," she says, 
shrugging her shoulders. A few days 
after Steadman leaves Yale, she will 
train at the Peace Corps center in 
Philadelphia, and in a few weeks, she 
will be teaching English in Zaire. 
Though she says she is scared, her gaze 
is steady as she explains her reason for 
volunteering two years of her life to 
live in the Third World. Having grown 
up with the Quaker tradition of public 
service and pacifism, Steadman feels a 
moral obligation to "do something 
good for someone." She believes the 
United States should have a national 
service requirement. At the same time, 
Steadman has a practical reason for 
volunteering in the Peace Corps. 
Unlike many of her classmates, she 
knows she doesn't want to go to 
business or law school. The Peace 
Corps will test her interest in teaching 
as a career. Laughing, she says, "This 
is a 
highly professional step I'm 
taking." 

Catharine Steadman was one of 27 
Yale seniors and graduates to receive 
offers from the Peace Corps in 1986. 
Though every year we hear of the rush 
of corporate-minded seniors to Wall 
Street, or of hundreds of seniors 
submitting resumes 
to investment 
banking programs, the Peace Corps, 
not M organ Stanley, has consistently 
been the largest employer of Yale 
graduates. 

"There is an abiding 
interest here in public service," Susan 
Hauser, dean of Career Services, in-
sisted. In fact, in the 25 year history of 
the Corps, Yale has been the largest 
supplier of volunteers, sending over 
five hundred graduates to serve in the 
Third World. Why do Yalies volunteer 
for the Peace C orps? 

Phillip Stevens ('62) had what he 
called the "standard attitude" towards 
his two years in Nigeria with the Peace 
Corps. He understood vaguely that he 


--- Page 17 ---

was going over to do good, but the 

\lege 
accepted. 

Walter Johnson ('64) served in 
Uganda from 1964-66 more out of a 
spirit for adventure than anything else. 
The Corps appealed to him as a new 
idea; an exotic opportunity. At the 
same time, he felt some obligation 
towards his country, though not as 
strongly as Steadman: "I don't know 
where I got that feeling. Perhaps it was 
more common at the time than it is 
now." Certainly the popularity of 
President Kennedy and the publicity 
surrounding the Corps gave wide 
circulation to values of patriotism, 
service and sacrifice- if the details of 
who was being served abroad, and 
how, remained more amorphous. The 
Peace Corps provided an excellent 
"There is a radical humanism in this place that 
teaches the individual that in using the 
extraordinary resources of this institution to 
develop his own potential, he learns how to 
use himself in the service of the larger human 
community."

with a sense of

up with 
s. To students 
a closed, elite community like 
Yale, the Peace Corps offered the 
chance to practice their idealism in the 
"real world". In the summer after 
graduation, Nick Allis ('64) joined 
many of his classmates trying to 
register black voters in Mississippi. 
AJJis had come from a Christian "do-
gooder" background, and the civil 
rights movement fulfilled his need to 
serve others as well as his need to 
engage in some kind of action. "There 
were some real political issues being 
discussed and then acted upon, with 
some risk to the participants," Allis 
recalled. In retrospect, Allis believes 
that his sense of isolation from these 
issues at Yale provided a positive sort 
of frustration, an incentive to become 
involved in social issues. "I did feel 
Yale was enclosed, and wasn't directly 
a part of these things. But then, that's 
what college is for, isn't it? To give you 
a chance to learn and think." Allis' 
experience with civil rights activism led 
to his decision to join the Peace Corps. 
Compared to his experiences in Missis-
sippi, the Peace Corps was a dis-
appointment. Teaching in a secondary 
school in Nigeria, Allis felt none of the 
heady excitement he had known in 
Mississippi. "Teaching is teaching, 
even if it's in rural west Africa. It didn't 
have the intensity of being on the front 
line of a struggle." If Allis and the 
many other idealistic volunteers who 
first joined the Peace Corps were "wide 
eyed", they soon found that neither the 
Third World nor the Peace Corps had 
any room for great causes of social 
change. 

As part of the first generation of 
Peace Corps volunteers, these three 
men 
reflected the naivete that 
characterized the early years of the 
Peace Corps itself. The first volunteers 
were typically recent college graduates 
who had studied liberal arts, and were 
figuring out what to do with their lives. 
T hough 
Congress 
had 
considered 
similar ideas in the late 1950s, the idea 
of the Peace Corps became popular 
only after Kennedy raised it in his 
campaign for the Presidency. The 
early enthusiasm for the Peace Corps, 
strongest among students, was closely 
tied to Kennedy's image: his idealism 
and youth encouraged a spirit of 
patriotism, service, and sacrifice, and 
promised adventure to pioneers of the 
President's "New Frontier." 

If volunteers were more ambivalent


--- Page 18 ---

about their actual service than their 
own ideals or personal needs, their 
views reflected the values of the Peace 
Corps itself. The Corps emphasized its 
benefits for the United States as much 
as its benefit for the countries it was 
serving. The Peace Corps Act of 1961 
o u tlined 
three goals that 
have 
remained the Corps' governing ideals. 
By sending American "volunteers for 
peace" to Africa, Latin America, and 
Asia, the Corps would aid developing 
countries with trained manpower, 
create a better understanding of the 
United States in those countries, and 
increase Americans' understanding of 
fore ig n 
cultures. 
Rather 
than 
perpetuate the image of the Ugly 
American, going abroad with little 
concern for native language or culture, 
imposing his own plans for change 
with cigar in hand, the Peace Corps 
would help Third World development 
on an individual level, encouraging 
native 
communities 
to 
help 
themselves. The Peace Corps does not 
decide where projects are conducted, 

"O n your willingness not merely to serve one 
or two years in the Service, but on your 
willingness to contribute part of your life to 
this country, I think will depend the answer 
whether we as a free society can compete." 
-] ohn F. K enned y 

or which volunteers will participate; 
countries submit requests for 
volunteers and then choose from 
among those that the Peace Corps 
nominates. 

A concern for the United States' hnage 
abroad dominated the goals of the 
Peace Corps. The priority of that 
concern in shaping the early Corps was 
confirmed by a selection policy that 
sought out educated Americans more 
than Americans who had concrete 
skills to offer developing countries. 
"The Peace Corps in the early days had 
the feeling that it was Kennedy's 
progeny. It was more an elitist appeal 
to people with liberal arts backgrounds 
to get their hands dirty," Stephen 
Bingham ('64) 
observed. "It was 
considered important that liberal arts 
majors would bring a set of values that 
others would not." When Allis, 
Stephens, and Johnson were selected 
to teach in schools in Africa, none of 
them had had teaching experience; but 
they were all Yale graduates, bright 
and motivated liberal arts majors, and 
therefore considered the most suitable 
to represent the United States and the 
most capable of effecting change. 

Kennedy at Yale in 1962: H ia image inapired much of th e early enth uaiaam 
for the Peace Corpa. 

Once in the Third World, Peace 
Corps volunteers faced tremendous 
cultural 
differences. 
Part 
of the 
problem was that volunteers had 
difficulty 
adapting 
their 
communities and being accepted as 
equals. In Uganda, Walter Johnson 
saw one of his students from secondary 
school push a woman off a bus; the 
student believed that he was privileged 
because the white man was teaching 
him. Johnson realized that education 
was not giving his students a greater 
sense of responsibility for their society. 
Instead, they would return from school 
vacations boasting about how they had 
avoided work. Twenty years later, 
Johnson think's little of the impact he 
had as a teacher in Africa. But at the 
time he remained at a distance from 
his community, undoubtedly making 
his task all the harder. In his little free 
time, he kept to himself, reading crates 
of books provided to him through the 
Peace Corps. He also played on a 
rugby team with players from Britain, 
and toured Africa to play against 
native teams. 

Even when volunteers actively 
sought integration into the ir 
communities, they found themselves 
unable to help because they lacked the 
necessary skills and cultural insight. 
Bingham served in an experimental 
Corps program 
in community 
development in Sierra Leone from 
1965-1967. There with his wife as an 
"outside agent of change", Bingham 
was to live in the commumty to 
encourage initiative in the native 
population for finding new solutions to 
their problems of daily life. The project 
epitomized the Peace Corps' approach 
to development; volunteers were 
passively involved, and yet were meant 
to have a positive influence, provoking 
change without directing it. Bingham 
became quickly disillusioned with the 
program and the Corps, finding that 
he could offer little to the community 
that helped the community develop 
itself. "They accepted ideas that we 
suggested not as inquiring minds but

because we were white people, and 
white people were bound to succeed," 
he explained. For Bingham, the Peace 
Corps, 
which brought general 
intentions and few real skills to a 
culture where colonialism and the 
Catholic Church had destroyed black 
peoples' self-esteem for generations, 
could only be counterproductive. 


Since its more naive beginnings, the 
Corps has attempted to improve its 
efficacy by emphasizing the need for 
practical skills and background in 
public service in its recruitment. When 
David Foltz ('77) went to Rwanda to 
teach advanced English conversation 
to university students, he already had 
three years of teaching experience in 
Europe, experience which he believes 
made him an attractive candidate for 
the 
Corps. 


Catharine Steadman, 
thou gh she had been only a distant 
adm irer of Dwight Hall community 
service, had gone to a high school 
where such service was required; in 
addition, she too had a year of teaching 
experience during her Junior year 
abroad. Now using the slogan. "The 
Toughest job You'll Ever Love", the 
Peace Corps offers 
programs in 
forestry, agriculture, health, business 
and seven other fields in addition to 
teaching and English language 
programs. At the same time, the Peace 
Corps has become highly selective and 
competitive. A vague interest in doing 
good and in having an adventure are 
no longer enough; while most college 
graduates are slated for teaching 
programs, the Peace Corps also seeks 
people with technical skills. Allis, 
J ohnson and Stevens joined the Peace 
Corps with relative ease. But in 1986, 
of 13,000 who applied to the Peace 
Corps, 3,000 were accepted. Although 
Yale received 27 of those offers, even a 
Yale graduate like Steadman can no 
longer simply waltz into the Corps. 


The process 
requires a 
14-page 
application, eight recommendations, 
and a lengthy interview. As a result of 
this competitiveness, volunteers are 
now more qualified- if one can ever be 
qualified for the experience they will 
face. Through a two to three month 
training program, the Peace Corps 
Step hen Bingham '64: T wo years of "welfare colonialism " in Sierra uone. 
now attempts to prepare volunteers 
project, but had himself transferred to 
more thoroughly. During this training, 
another project working with poor 
the volunteers take courses in the 
upland farmers that better suited his 
language, politics, history, and culture 
interests. Tuner's pragmatism led him 
of a region, and may also have on-the-
to join despite the fact that he didn't 
job or technical training to familiarize 
even agree with the Peace Corps as an 
them with their specific jobs and help 
institution; 
he 
had 
to justify 
them "brush up" on their skills. 


As the Peace Corps has become 
more skill-oriented, volunteers have 
realized that they can use it to acquire 
valuable training and 
experience. 
After becoming interested 
tn 
anthropology at Yale, Allen Tuner 
('70) had gone to Mexico to study 
Mayan hieroglyphics. That exposure 
increased his desire to have a cross-
cultural learning experience at the 
grass-roots 
level. 
He eventually 
applied to the Peace Corps for very 
practical reasons: he wanted to travel, 
and could not find a non-professional 
job that would allow him to save 
enough money to do it on his own. The 
Peace Corps would not only support 
him in another country. it would train 
him in some practical skiJls that he 
sought in either health or agriculture. 
Assigned to the Dominican Republic, 
he was slated for a rice irrigation 


In the sixties Somalia 
was famous for 
sending volunteers 
home in strait jackets.

The three hour 
videotape that the Peace Corps shows 
during recruitment, or the warnings 
and scenarios that you receive in 
training, cannot prepare you for this; 
after three days, maybe after you have 
stepped over your ftrst dead body, then 
you start to learn what numbers mean. 


For Zyg Plater, 
Ethiopia was a 
museum society, Haile Selassie had 
ruled by a kind of divine right since 
1908. "Having gone to fine schools 
with highfalutin' ideals, volunteers 
would go to villages where the main 
issue is if the chief guy is going to kill 
someone.- anrl if he does, he will do it 
to 
impress you." Plater compared 
going to Ethiopia with stepping into 
16th-century Europe. 


Not everyone can handle the shock 
of going into such a foreign culture and 
being left to make do as they can. In 
the sixties Somalia was notorious for 
sending volunteers home in straight 
jackets. Plater met a fellow volunteer 
in a desolate part of Ethiopia and asked 
directions from him; though the man 
had probably not seen another white 
person in months, he only responded 
with "yes." "He was fried," Plater said. 
•He'd gotten involved, realized he was 
not going to change the world, and that 
his presence was ambiguous." The 
most common reaction to culture 
shock is that volunteers go home. Of 
Whitney Sanders' Peace Corps .dass 
that went abroad in June of 1981-', 40 
percent returned to the United States 
at some point before the end of their 
two years. In any given year, the Peace 
Corps generally ends up sending 30 
percent of the volunteers home early. 


Living in the Third World 
blemished the United States' image in 
many volunteers' eyes. Sanders 
recalled passing a hut in Sierra Leone 
where the only light came from a 
television set showing "Charlie's 
Angels"-an image of the United 
States that, for an American, seemed 
grotesque in a place where no one ever 
had enough food to eat. Living in 
villages without running water or 
electricity sensitized volunteers to the 
States' enormous waste of the world's 
resources. In Sierra Leone, Bingham 
saw the "quiet dignity" of rural people 
who have learned the cycle of their 
lives: "It's a humbling experience for 
those of us who live in the microwave 
society." Foltz experienced a similar 
disillusionment with American con-
sumption and complacency. One of 
the first things he did upon returning 
to the States was attend a Harvard-
Yale football game. "Sitting in the 
stands, I thought, 'I haven't seen so 
many white people in two years'. . . 
everyone seemed so irrelevant, but 
then so was I, and I · had been in 
Rwanda." 


Though a goal of the Peace Corps 
was to "improve" the image of the 
United States abroad, it often has the 
inverse effect, revealing to volunteers 
the reality of the U .. S.'s good intentions 
and interest in international 
development. Bingham believes that 
the Peace Corps is a logical extension 
of our foreign policy, which, rather 
tttan allowing Third World countries 
their own path of development, 
encourages a dependence on the inter-
national market and on cash crops, of 
which the United States may be a 
prime consumer. 


"Self-sufficient 
farming is disappearing in Africa," he 
explained. "People are now starving 
where 50 years ago they supported 
themselves." Similarly, Zyg Plater saw 
the Peace Corps as a tool for a kind of 
welfare colonialism that was practiced 
most under the Nixon administration. 
"If those countries had economic 
power, the US would snuff it out." A 
volunteer serving with Plater in 
Ethiopia discovered that the country 
possessed ideal climate and soil for 
growing oranges in the off-season, 
when oranges in Israel or the Arab 
countries are not yet ripe. The 
American Embassy prevented any 
development of the idea, because 
coffee is Ethiopia's major export crop 
and the US its major buyer. "So long 
as it had one crop, it was going to be 
beholden to the US," Platter 
continued. "Oranges would bring 
Ethiopia into a diversified market, and 
that was politically disequilibrating." 


Impressions of their time abroad 
remains with volunteers, in ways that 
are often impossible to describe. "The 
things I was learning then are the most 
important things I ever learned," 
Tuner said. "But I can't really say what 
they are. 
Professionally they are

worthless, now that I have a career that 
I'd never dreamed I'd be doing." Tuner 
had vowed never to go back to school, 
but his 
Peace 
COrps experience 
encouraged him to pursue graduate 
work 
in agriculture. 
Every time 
Stephen Bingham reads about the 
Third World, he thinks about the 
village in which he lived. "The Peace 
Corps has been a critical element in 
my maintaining a commitment to 
social change," Bingham said. "There's 
an ongoing hum in the back of my 
mind that ther.e are people starving out 
there." 
After their return, many volunteers 
were influenced in their choice of 
professional careers by their exper-
ience in Peace Corps. Nick Allis now 
practices as a public interest lawyer in 
the field of consumer safety. Whitney 
Sanders. went 
to 
Yale School of 
Architecture -after he returned to 
pursue an interest in urban housing: "I 
learned about making do with what 
you're given, through channels that are 
not often used, and again·st pressures 
that you don't normally feel . . . 
making do with materials that are less · 
costly, and coming up with new ways 
to interpret common problems in 
building methods." Sanders had 
dreams about Sierra Leone just after 
his return, and still, not a day goes by 
when he does not think about it. Zyg 
Plater felt he learned something about 
himself that has nothing to do with his 
law school or college degrees. "The 
Peace Corps teaches you what you can 
do as a human being," he said. Each 
little victory he had in Ethiopia, 
however insignificant and however 
unnoticed by anyone else, gave him 
the exhilaration of transcending three 
centuries all by himself. 
Graduates who joined the Peace 
Corps seemed to agree that Yale had in 
some way influenced them to go, 
although they had d ifficulty describing 
exactly how. "There were things at 
Yale that allowed me to see the Peace 
Corps as an option, things at Yale that 
allowed me to make the Peace Corps a 
valuable experience," explained 
Tuner. Some volunteers speak of 
Zygmunt Broel-Plater, Yale Law School, 
Class of '68. 
•' 
having learned self-reliance. Perhaps 
the rigors of Yale encourage evaluation 
of one's potential. Perhaps Yale does a 
good job of reminding students that 
they don't live in only one world, and 
that their lives don't have to be two-
dimensional. Certainly the diversity of 
student experience of which 
Yale 
presidents have spoken so highly 
continues to be a part of our education. 
"Yale teaches you to be versatile and 
multifaceted," Johnson said. "I got that 
from my own experience of going from 
my jock friends on the hockey team to 
the El~zabethan club to discuss Dante's 
Inferno." Diversity at Yale is a far cry 
from 
the 
cultural differences 
volunteers encounter while walking 
miles of dirt road in the Third World, 
thinking of their home town. But Yale 
might teach the need to confront 
diversity and make it a part of one's life 
in order to continue learning. 
Perhaps experiencing Yale's 
diversity 
challenges students 
continue experimenting with their lives 
once they walk through its gates for the 
last time. The Peace Corps is one 
means through which graduates go on 
learning about themsel_ves and their 
world. When Zyg Plater was at Yale 
Law School before entering the Corps, 
he came across many students he 
characterizes as "sodden preppies 



**Title: Yale and the Peace Corps (Continued)**
**Page number(s): 23**

going on to become mindless rich 
men." But he also found people similar 
to those he would later meet in the 
Corps- people with "unconventional 
things going on inside them," some of 
whom still cared about making a 
difference. The experiences of Yale 
and the Peace Corps are inseparable 
for Plater, because from both he 
learned 
importance of doing 
something special. 
Because Plater 
went into the Peace Corps, he saw his 
possibilities open instead of close. "I 
might have gone to Wall Street if I 
hadn't done the Peace Corps," Plater 
said. 
Now a professor at Boston 
College Law School, he likes to tell his 
students three things that he believes 
capture what he learned from both 
Yale and the Peace Corps: "You're here 
to make a life as well as a living, and if 
you're lucky, a difference." 
Catharine Steadman's parents have 
arrived as the late afternoon sun 
streams into Pierson College, and they 
stand listening to her speak. She knows 
more of what to expect than did the 
first generation of Peace Corps 
volunteers. She explains that she does 
not hope to accomplish Great Things 
because the Peace Corps has warned 
her that she probably will not. A friend 
who served in the Corps recently wrote 
Steadman: "You realize how you're 
changing much faster than you see 
how they're changing." Though she is 
aware of these things, Steadman knows 
as little as other graduates have known 
upon leaving school. A last question as 
Steadman walks through the gate to 
Park Street: How does she feel? She 
smiles. "Pm sort of in shock. We leave 
the fifth of July."

Professor Micaela di L eonardo: Last 
semester over 40 men took her Women's 
Studies class. 
The scene opens with two men sitting 
in easy chairs, knitting. 
A Joan 
Armatrading record plays softly in the 
background. All is calm, until the 
argument begins. 
It starts ofT innocently enough, one 
man announcing that it was he who 
decided to name their cats "Sappho" 
and "Julia Kristeva," while the other 
complains 
that 
he had favored 
"Suzanne Vega." "Well, I took the cat 
to Washington for the March for 
Women's Lives," huffs the first. 
And the war is on. "I only read 
poetry by women," one of the men 
declares. 
"I only read lesbian poetry," the 
other man snaps. 
"I only read black lesbian poetry." 
"I am a black lesbian poet!" 
The subject 
turns to Women's 
Studies classes. Who has taken more? 
"I haven't taken a course with a man 
yet," one of the men announces 
proudly. The other one snorts. "I really 
understand women," he says. "I'm gay. 
I share the same marginalized position 
in the patriarchal power structure. 
We're both oppressed." He accuses the 
other man of being competitive and 
unsympathetic. How to resolve this 
issue? The scene ends with both men 
rolling on the floor, one experiencing 
menstrual cramps and the other labor 
pains, while both yell, "I want to be a 
woman!" 
24 The New Journal/january 30. 1987 
Last October, 
at the coffeehouse 
sponsored by Aurora, Yale's feminist 
magazine, Mark Gevisser, (SY '87) 
and Phil Auerswald, (PC '87) called 
their performance "the sensitive man 
sketch." They parodied character-types 
that most of the audience could easily 
recognize. At Yale, the "sensitive man" 
takes. his own interest in women's 
issues too seriously, comes to believe, 
as in the skit, that sensitivity towards 
women's problems is an adequate 
substitute for actual experience. 
Feminists have always debated over 
the role men can or should play in the 
women's movement, and exaggerated 
stereotypes like the "sensitive 
man" often overshadow the finer points 
of that debate. At Yale, the issue 
remains a chaJlenging one, particularly 
in light of the fact that the male 
enrollment in Women's Studies 295a, 
the major's introductory course, rose 
roughly 700 percent this year. Last 
semester over 40 men took the course, 
which also doubled in size to 165 
people. 
While 
total 
male 
enrollment 
probably does not 
constitute a 
campus-wide trend 
towards 
feminism, 
percentage 
increase is large enough to warrant a 
closer look at what was behind it and 
what it may suggest. 
Micaela di Leonardo, 
assistant 
professor of anthropology, has taught 
introductory 
women's 
studies 
course since last year, and she's happy 
about 
the sudden surge 
m 
mal<" 
enrollment. Eager to talk about it, she 
suggested a possible explanation for 
the new numbers. "A lot of male 
students knew about me because of 
[my involvement in] the divestment 
campaign," she said. "These were 
people who were already concerned 
about larger issues of social inequity. 
They knew gender was related to these 
issues and wanted to get the facts." Di 
Leonardo has encouraged students to 
see this relation through talks she has 
given at PROP, the pre-freshman 
orientation program for 
m inority 
students. She recalled how, after one of 
her speeches, a black student came up 
to her and asked her point-blank why 
he should be a feminist. "I had him 
imagine for a minute that I was in his 
position," she explained. "As a black 
man, I might say, 'I know there is a 
connection between these two great 
historical evils. I don't want to be 
feared on the street. I want my girl 
children to grow up and be able to 
realize their potential. I want to be an 
equal partner."' Drawing these 
parallels between sexual and racial 
discrimination was an important part 
of di Leonardo's appr·oach to teaching 
the introductory class during her firsl 
year. 
A sophomore taking the intro-
ducwry course, Chris Kelley, (TD 
'89), also believes that the relationship 
between oppressed groups has 
contributed to the popularity of the 
class. "The gay movement and the

"They'd say things 
like, 'Are you gay? 
Are you a reformed 
rapist? What's the 
deal?'" 
second wave of the feminist movement 
sort of correspond," he said. "There's a 
very different nature in the rela-
tionship betw'een women and gay 
men." He explained that gay men can 
have a better perspective on women 
than straight men, one that is closer to 
the way in which women perceive 
themselves. 


J ackie Dirks, a teaching assistant for 
di Leonardo's course, suggested that 
the growth of Yale's divestment cam-
paign and the greater visibility of its 
gay community in recent years has 
created a more open atmosphere, 
encouraging 
a 
questioning of 
conventional values. "Whereas last 
year's course enrollment was evenly 
divided among all four classes, this 
year it's overwhelmingly made up of 
seniors," Dirks said. "I'd say they've 
been here three years and things have 
happened that disturbed them, that 
made them realize Yale is a sexist 
place. T hey think, 'If it can be this bad 
here, it must be really terrible other 
places."' 


W hile becoming more politically 
aware after three years at Yale may 
lead some men to explore women's 
stud ies, the number of men enrolled is 
still low. "Oh, it's a fear of ridicule," di 
Leonardo said tersely, when asked why 
more men are not involved. One of her 
students, Adam Kaplan, (TC '88), 
remembered the reactions of· some 
male friends when they learned he was 
taking the class: "They'd say things 
like, 'Are you gay? Are you a reformed 
rapist? What's the deal?"' Larry 
Bencivenga, (ES '87), 
who 
took 
•Feminism and Philosophy" last year, 
explained, "We're not yet at the level 
where men even think Women's Stu-
dies courses are relevant to them." 


The strong reputation of professors 
like Nancy Cott (History), Patricia 
Joplin (English), and di Leonardo, 
who are affiliated with the Women's 
Studies Department, is an added factor 
in the Department's growing popu-
larity. Still, all but five Women's 
Studies courses are cross-listed in other 
departments, 
primarily 
because 
Women's Studies gets so little funding 
from the University that they have to 
share the expenses of paying professors 
and T As with other older and better-
supported departments. 


Some male students in the class 
expressed that they've been able to 
apply what they've learned to their 
daily lives and to their relationships 
with women. "For a couple of years I 
thought of myself as a feminist without 
any sense of what that meant," said 
Steve Kantrowitz, (ES '87). "Since 
taking the course I have a clearer idea. 
It's made me think more concretely 
about things like sharing child care, 
two part-time careers . . . . I think 
most of the guys from the class were 
thinking some of the same things." 


Male reactions 
to the broad 
introductory course were mixed, 
however, 
with some not quite 
understanding di 
Leonardo's 
approach, sometimes feeling singled 
out. The professor explained that she 
finds it valuable to single out male 
students in certain instances. "We were 
having a 
week on 
Violence vs. 
Women, and I made sure to address 
the men in the class," she said. "I 
wanted it not to be a threatening issue, 
but 'Let's talk about what you can do as 
supportive men.'" In section, these 
problems were addressed 
more 
directly. Kantrowitz described how the 
four men in his section, including 
himself, often felt self-conscious and 
wary about possibly interrupting other 
students or monopolizing class 
participation. Dirks admitted that the 
professor and assistants had divided 
the sections of 295a with an eye to "the 
historical tendency of men to dominate 
discussion." 


Some students gave examples of 
instances when gender distinctions in 
class were helpful. George Grohwin 
(TD, '87) recalled a discussion in his 
section about women and the sciences, 
in which the female students were 
arguing that women had to be sexless 
creatures to be taken seriously in the 
scientific arena. He pointed out that 
men involved in science are also often 
perceived as "nerdy" types. "There are 
things that men can't really discuss 
because they have to do with being a 
woman-a woman's experience," said 
Kelley. "So we just had to sit back and 
listen 
But that's 
good, 
it's 
enlightening." 


Di Leonardo envisions her class as 
one that can produce enlightened 
attitudes, and she is 
careful 
to 
emphasize the philosophy behind her 
approach. 
A 
male student once 
accused her, she recalled, of teaching 
the introductory class "from a feminist 
bias." "It's important to historicize," 
she explained later. "(This student] 
read a book on feminist education, and 
later came back and spoke to me again. 
H e said, 'You've really changed my 
mind, and I can say now that fm a 
feminist, 
with 
relaxation."' Di 
Leonardo does not see this year's male 
interest in her course as a fluke, but 
claims that "it's only going to get 
better." 


The surge 
in 
male 
academic 
involvement in women's issues has 
encouraged men to commit themselves 
to projects through the Yale Women's 
Center. 
T im 
Wt,:i~ht (SM 
'88) 
and 
Jay 
Sekor a 
(ES 
'89), 
for example, are male staff members of 
Aurora, the feminist magazine. Wright 
explained that "there's a real psy-
chological barrier about going to the 
Women's Center, a feeling that 'Men 
just don't do that.' Or some people 
think, 'It's the ultimate P.n. thing to 
do, and so I won't do it.'" Yet, Wright is 
an example of one who has tran-
scended that barrier. One male who 
has been active in feminist politics, 
Michael Weingrad, (TC '90), believes 
that academic involvement provides a 
less threatening introduction to 
feminism. "There's a need for both 
kinds of involvement," he said. "(T he 
introductory course] raises awareness 
also." 


Weingrad's involvement 
the 
Coalition for an Educated Choice 
(CEC) began when several friends 
took him to the pro-choice rally in 
Washington t>.C. last March. "I was 
just blown away," he said. "It made 
things very clear to me. But people 
have to understand- it's hard for guys 
because you're in the middle of a rally, 
and you realize that it really isn't 
yours." Nevertheless, Weingrad said 
he was surprised more m en are not 
involved politically in women's issues. 
"If R oe v. Wade is overturned, it will 
affect guys very strongly, in terms of 
the lives of their girlfriends, their 
daughters," he said. "So many people 
in this community are concerned with 
racial oppression abroad, but there's 
still no ERA in the United States." 


Last year's Rape Awareness Project 
(RAP) led several male students to 
form a discussion group. RAP's week-
long series of educational program s 
included taping a red "X" on each spot 
around the campus where a rape had 
taken place. "Rape Awareness Week 
really got a lot of men thinking in ways 
that they hadn't before," said Gevisser. 
In fact, several students organized a 
"For Men Only" discussion g.roup. 
About 60 people showed up. "Ori-
ginally scheduled to be one hour, the 
discussion lasted for over two. "Initially 
a lot of men expressed resentment," 
said Bencivenga. "They felt attacked." 
By the end of the meeting, however, 
many different sentiments had been 
expressed, and most participants 
considered the gathering a success. 


In light of this enthusiasm, R ob 
Spencer, a first-year medical student, 
suggested the formation of a per-
manent discussion group which would 
meet periodically to discuss male views 
on feminist issues. This plan went into 
effect last spring. Table tents 
advertised the new organization as the 
"Men's Caucus" and explained that a 
different issue, from pornography to 
traditional family roles, would be 
discu ssed each week. 


Regular 
attendance sifted down to about ten to 
twelve men. 


Views about the Caucus' ultimate 
goals differed. Some preferred the 
loose structure of a discussion group. 
arguing the necessity of informality.

Afterthought/Helen Cutting Whitney 
A Divine, Ordinary Life 
Helen Cutting Whitney, married to Yale 
President Benno C. 
Schmidt Jr., is a 
documentary film director for ABC. In 1981 
she made a film, The Monastery, about 
the lives of Trappist monks living in 
Spencer, Massachusetts. Last fall, the Abbot 
of this monastery, Father Tom Keating, 
spoke at the Yale Divinity School, and 
Whitney introduced him. The following is a 
copy of her speech, the first public address she 
made at Yale. 

I would like to offer a more personal 
than theological introduction to Father 
Tom Keating. Our friendship began in 
somewhat unusual circumstances, and 
survived-some might say-a trial by 
fire ... the making of a film for ABC 
in 1982 about St. Joseph's Abbey. 

Father Tom had been the Abbot of the 
Trappist monastery for over 25 years. 
Getting permission from him to make 
this film and then living through it 
with him was an extraordinarily in-
tense, frequently disruptive, but finally 
unforgettable experience. Unforget-
table in the best sense of the word for 
me ... perhaps in both best and worst 
senses for him. 

"After such 
knowledge," to paraphrase T.S. Eliot, 
"can only come forgiveness." 

I had wanted to make a film about 
this subject for a long while. Religious 
questions have always been of interest 
to me, the network was ready for the 
first time to air such a program, and 
the time felt right. The early 80's 
seemed to be a period-even more 
than the 60's-of restless, even chaotic 
spiritual yearnings; yet paradoxically, 
and this was part of the challenge, I 
also felt it was a time when spiritual 
commitment was difficult, when the 
belief that there was another reality, 
and one of ultimate significance for 
man, was disappearing. 

I came to St. Joseph's Abbey for a 
variety of reasons. I knew that the 
backgrounds of the men there were 
extraordinarily diverse-a diversity 
unequalled in most other monasteries 
-so that the fabric of American life 
would be interwoven in their lives and 
spiritual concerns. More importantly,


I knew that the monastery- under the 
guidance of Abbot Tom Keating- had 
opened itself to modernity by turning 
eastwards in an attempt to discover an 
interior spirituality. Spiritual growth 
and the desire for transformation, 
found at the heart of Eastern religions, 
seem to be lacking in the more 
organized religions of Christianity and 
Judaism. Many of the former Chris-
tians I knew and interviewed felt that 
Christianity had lost the method and 
the meaning of contemplative prayer, 
and because of this was no longer able 
to penetrate their lives. What was 
happening at St. Joseph's suggested to 
me 
that 
what 
was 
lost 
in 
Christianity- at least to some people 
-could be found again. 

He taught me that it 
is the challenge of our 
time to find God or· 
the ultimate reality 
hidden in the most 
unexpected places. 

I remember arriving at St. Joseph's 
on a bleak November morning, gazing 
at the slate grey sky and the stones of 
the monastery. Nervous and appre-
hensive, I felt I was entering an 
unknown world. Abbot Tom greeted 
me, put me immediately at ease, and 
we spent ·much of the day talking. 

It was my first exposure to his 
legendary courtesy. Courtesy born out 
of his ability and his desire to imagine 
in the fullest and most nuanced way 
the other person's situation, a tact best 
described by Rebecca West as "the 
manners of the soul." 

It was also my first experience of 
another one of Father Tom's legendary 
qualities- tough-mindedness. I, the 
experienced interviewer, was clearly 
out-interviewed. I went through the 
most subtle but thorough and rigorous 
examination of my reasons not only for 
making the film but an examination of 
my very soul. Looking back on all the 
documentaries I have produced, and 
all the various permissions I have 
secured, no process was more arduous 
than this one. I ran through a gauntlet 
that involved not only interviews and 
screenings of my films, but a meeting 
-supervised by the Abbot- with the 
entire monastery to answer their 
questions. The meeting was pas-
sionate, 
rowdy and 
surprisingly 
unmonastic, and I remembered being 
exhausted by the debate but delighted 
by 
the 
expressions of wit 
and 
eloquence in the community. 

Father Tom's concerns about the 
film were appropriate and revealing. 
He did not want to be part of a film 
that was a 
behind-the-walls look, 
however complimentary, of an exotic 
world; a network hour of esoterica 
filled with 'pretty pictures and 
marvelous music. He believed that the 
monastery does have meaning for 
modern man, and that our film might 
help suggest some of those meanings. 
He didn't want to play it safe, to preach 
to the converted. If he was going to 
agree to this film, then he wanted to 
reach the uncommitted, the seekers, 
the disaffected. He sought to touch 
people who would never consider join-
ing a monastery, or even making a 
retreat, and yet who would feel a 
nostalgia 
for something 
it 
represents-fidelity, loyalty, sacrifice. He 
even 
wanted 
to reach 
the "me" 
generation, 
for whom 
enclosure, 
chastity, 
even commitment, 
is 
a 
scandal. Why not, he asked, try to 
challenge the congenital narcissism of 
their culture where the search for the 
true self has absurdly taken on some of 
the markings of a religious quest? 

To agree to the film and to allow a 
woman to do it said a great deal about 
the spirit of openness and risk-taking of 
Father Tom and his monastery. To 
follow through with the commitment 
as completely as he did was a mark of 
both his confidence and even his 
courage. I remember being struck by 
both these qualities in our first tough 
discussion about the issue of editorial 
control and also about the questions of 
motivation that I would be raising.

"We approach it from 
different angles, but 
it's always the same. 
What does it mean to 
be a man, how are 
we indoctrinated?" 

"The point of it wasn't to figure out 
what's 'right,' just to clarify what we 
felt individually," said Jonathan Reff 
(TC '88). "The idea wasn't to change 
anybody ... The issue was the whole 
question of masculinity in society. The 
role of women has changed, but I don't 
think the notion of masculinity really 
has. That's always the issue for the 
group. We approach it from different 
angles, but it's the same thing. What 
does it mean to be a man, how are we 
indoctrinated?" 

Bencivenga, 
however, 
frustrated by what he saw as the 
Caucus' passivity. "My problem with it 
was that I felt all they wanted to do was 
just sit around and talk," he said. In 
retrospect he feels less angry about the 
lack of political commitment, ex-
plaining that some of the members of 
the Caucus were involved with the 
divestment campaign and that 
everyone involved was forced to make 
choices. "In the end," he said, "it's 
important just to get men and women 
working together on these issues." 

Although the creators of the Men's 
Caucus did not anticipate that women 
would want to take part in their 
discussions, the group later decided to 
welcome 
interested women. 
Some 
women, including Renee Schwalberg 
(ES '87) and Pam Thompson (MC 
'87), co-editor of Aurora, did attend. 
Thompson remembered one of her 
visits to the Caucus: "I made a face 
about something, and this guy just 
turned and said, 'Look! You're looking 
at me! You're judging me!' It turned 
out to be nothing . . . But it's really 
scary - the insecurity, the hostility, 
and the fear involved in it." 

Schwalberg also recalled having 
difficulty at first with the unusual 
format of the Caucus. "I went to one 
meeting and gave a little talk about 
feminist theory," she explained. "But 
afterwards there was a very strong 
reaction against talking politics. Most 
of the men in the room were straight-
-I think all but one- and it turned 
into a discussion of . . . who makes the 
first move and why." She laughed. 
"The next meeting was on the family, 
and that was better. It wasn't just 
talking about 
girlfriends-- it 
talking about mothers, sisters. 
When the discussions were directed, 
they were more productive." She, 
however, still maintains Bencivenga's 
earlier stance. "I do wish it had been 
more activist. There are things these 
men could be doing." 

Their interest piqued by positive 
groups like the Men's Caucus, some 
men have even committed themselves 
to helping victims of sexual assault. 
Bencivenga, for instance, works for 
both the New Haven and Yale rape 
crisis centers. The former is a large 
organization 
which 
offers training 
programs each semester; the latter 
currently boasts 
three 
members, 
despite extensive publicity. Some of 
the more active members of last year's 
Men's Caucus, which did not resume 
its meetings last September, are now 
attempting to revive the organization. 

Mark Gevisser still chuckles when he 
thinks about his antics on stage at the 
coffeehouse, but he will also talk about


it a minute later in a serious tone. He 
addresses 
one of the 
potentially 
negative aspects of having men involve 
themselves in Women's Studies. "What 
happens is that people appropriate 
other people's problems, which isn't 
good," he explains. "I mean, I think 
it's much better to have men knitting 
than running around with guns or 
something. But it's important to poke 
fun to see that we still have an 
incredibly 
long way 
to go. 
We 
shouldn't be complacent. It annoys me 
when men - including myself, because 
that skit was definitely partly a self-
parody- get complacent. I said once to 
someone, 'Well, as a feminist . . .' and 
then I thought, 'Wait a minute, who 
are you to say you're a feminist?"' He 
pauses for a moment, then clarifies: "I 
think men can be their own kind of 
feminist. But I think it's a really bad 
kind of sexism to think men can have 
the same feminist cause as women. 
There are certainly things men can do, 
but always with the perspective that 
they're men. The skit was poking fun 
at losing that perspective." 

While di Leonardo encourages male 
students to take her class, she does 
recognize that some of them may feel 
unwelcome in a Women's Studies 
course. But how does one go about 
making a male student feel at home in 
a Women's Studies class? "I hear that 
in section the TA's still ask for the 
'male point of view,"' said Schwalberg. 
"It won't work that way.'' One student 
suggested that whenever men choose to 
deal with these issues, they must 
always confront 
their maleness, 
perhaps much more so than they are 
otherwise forced to in a traditional 
scholastic environment. Speaking 
about his experiences with Intro-
ductory Women's Studies, 
Adam 
Kaplan remembered a passage from 
Virginia Woolf's A Room of One's Own: 
"She says something about how women 
are locked out, but perhaps it is worth 
noting that men are locked in."

I 
Most religious vocations- and 
~ecular ones as well- are subject to 
psychoanalytic interpretations. And 
there is both tension and mutuality 
between religious and psychoanalytic 
interpretations. Spiritual and psycho-
logical wholeness are not necessarily 
parallel paths; frequently they are 
divergent ones, even in conflict. These 
were questions- among many others 
that I would be pursuing. I received 
encouragement and 
support 
from 
Abbot Thomas to 
follow them 
wherever they led, with the hope, of 
course, that I 
would 
respect the 
essential 
mystery of each man's 
vocation. 

I made it clear to Father Tom- in 
the unnecessary way journalists put 
their cards on the table- that I would 
not sanitize the film by presenting him 
or his monks as pious, perfect, or 
serene, with unruffled faith or perfect 
charity- because I didn't believe it. I 
will never forget his merry laugh as he 
said to me, "Neither do I!" He under-
stood instinctively that people would 
be moved by the film, and open their 
hearts and minds to it, only in response 
to honesty, to willingness to risk 
vulnerability, 
doubts, 
fears, 
pain, 
joy- all the 
emotions 
that make 
monkc;, like the rest of us, human. 
It was a 
risk, and there were 
repercussions. 
While 
the general 
response was favorable, there was, 
nonetheless, 
a 
small, 
influential 
minoritv of conservati,·e Catholics who 
not ont'y disapproved of the idea of 
such a film. but were disturbed, even 
scandalized by the sight of monks 
displaying such human emotions. The 
film was denounced from the pulpit of 
St. Patrick's by the Cardinal of New 
York at that time. I heard about these 
criticisms only indirectly, rumors from 
the Catholic grapevine, the occasional 
irate letter, but never from Father 
Tom. He must have had an earful. 

But, he never burdened me with his 
troubles. Again, that superlative tact of 
his, and his loyalty to a commitment 
shone through. 

Father Tom was the true intellectual 
center of the entire experience, pulling 
together the scattered insights of all the 
monks into a cohesive whole. He 
taught me that it is the challenge of our 
time to find God or the ultimate reality 
hidden in the most unexpected places. 
If we identify God with church-going 
or institutions, then in that sense, as 
Our friendship began 
in somewhat unusual 
circumstances, and 
survived - some might 
say - a trial by fire. 
Father Tom believes, God is lost to us 
because the structures are gone. But 
the God who is evervwhere and is 
present in e,·ery facet of secular society 
can be known. And it is only through 
the contemplative dimension, which 
Father Tom describes as a value 
system based on the experience of one's 
own deep self and interior silence, that 
one can perceive this refined level of 
reality in which God is present. In 
contrast to the present climate of 
Catholicism, or at least to the recen t 
expressions of it coming from Rome, 
with emphasis so heavily on insti-
tutional structures and institutional 
truths, Father Tom's insights are not 
only valuable, but courageous as well. 

Father Tom also taught me to think 
about the ordinariness- and therefore 
the accessibility- of the 
monastic 
journey. When I started out on this 
film , Joseph Campell said: "What you 
will learn will be that the monastic 
journey is the specialists' journey. T he 
monks are the heroes of the spiritual 
life in that they let us know what is out 
there beyond the horizon . . . and 
perhaps how to channel some of it into 
our life." While I agree with much that 
Campell said, Father T om enabled me 
to see, on the contrary, both the 
uniqueness and the ordinariness of 
monastic life. 

He 
helped 
me to 
understand how his story- and the 
stories of all the monks- were finally 
the human journey itself, our oldest 
and deepest journey. To know the 
human heart, the nature of good and 
evil, and to search, above all other 
considerations, for the face of God. 

The last words Father Tom said to 
-me as he wa.tched the ABC crew 
packing up our equipment, all of us 
subdued, already homesick for the 
monastery we would soon leave, was 
that there was a monastic dimension in 
all of us, and that he hoped that I 
would come close to understanding 
that idea ... and come a little closer to 
that dimension ir. myself.
