Dana Berliner, (TD, '81) applies Rancfa fiction to her personal life: "What it c:omes 
down to is you don't let other people trample on you." 
as the welfare system, even if such a 
project required several decades to 
complete. "Ideally, 
private charity 
should and I think would take care of 
the people that are on welfare :·now," 
said Rubin. "Back when we had less 
welfare, more people gave to private 
charity. Basically, I believe that man is 
essentially good and that the world is a 
good place." Fischer thinks 
that 
objectivists have an overly optimistic 
view of human nature and would 
argue that, "If we just left it up to 
voluntary interaction it is probable 
that not enough people would con-
tribute. In many cases people will 
think it is fair that we have an overall 
social policy that requires a certain 
contribution and therefore they're 
willing to 
contribute given that 
everyone else does." 

According to Fischer, the optimism 
of objectivism makes the philosophy 
unique as well as easy to criticize. "It 
differs not just from socialist, marxist, 
and liberal doctrine, but even moder-
ate and some conservative doctrine in 
that objectivists don't favor a minimal 
level of 'positive' or welfare rights. 
They believe in libertarian rights or 
'negative' rights- that people 
not 
interfere with them," he said. As a 
resuit, many philosophers view objec-
tivists to be self-centered, not sensitive 
to the realities of society. Fischer 
contends that objectivists generalize 
about the human condition and fail to 
empathize with individual circum-
stances. "Objectivists tend to forget or 
deemphasize that people have special 
needs and that people are either born 
into tremendous poverty or they have 
natural handicaps and those people 
will inevitably not get very much out of 
a system which operates on Randian 
assumptions," said Fischer. 

For some objectivists, rational self-
centeredness transcends political 
philosophy to help them in their 
personal lives. "There is a certain way 
that I find objectivism very helpful as a 
woman because I really have to have 
an 'Okay, here I am, this is what I 
want and this is how I'm going to get it' 
attitude," said Dana Berliner (TD, 
'87), another member of the group. In 
her room, a copy of Atlas Shrugged lay 
open on the floor. Berliner had started 
rereading the novel one night during 
exam period and by the next day was 
almost half way through the 1168 page 
book. For Berliner, objectivism has 
provided a very organized way to think 
and live. "What it comes down to," she 
said, "is you don't let other people 
trample on you. I think that really 
helps a lot. If you think that the world 
is a rational place and you can achieve 
your goals, it is a lot easier to deal 
with." 

Berliner values the personal appli-
cations of objectivist thegry, but the 
philosophy is generally understood and 
criticized for its 
political, not its 
individual, implications. And objectiv-
ists don't mind the criticism, so long as 
it 
is well thought out. 
Several 
objectivists have said that they have 
had a difficult time finding open-
mindedness at Yale, an institution 
which they believe has a widespread 
liberal consensus and a prevailing 
dislike of conservatism. "There is too 
much knee-jerkism both on the left and 
the right, but especially on the left," 
Rubin said. "When everyone is liberal 
you kind of trip over yourself and say 
'yeah we should divest, yeah we should 
spend more money on social pro-
grams, and no nukes, and let's go sit on 
the Trident subs'- who !lives a damn 
why, everyone else is doing it! But Yale 
is not a microcosm of the real world." 

Rubin believes that most Yale students 
will be shocked to find that people in 
the 
non-academic 
world 
are less 
inclined to be liberal and that in the 
long ~:un, objectivism will provide a 
more practical outlook. Given the 
renewed interest in Rand and her 
works, perhaps objectivists will be able 
to find a more receptive audience 
outside of Yale.
