located outside of Leon. 
Sandra 
Thomas is a professional photographer 
for a newspaper in Milford; Catherine 
Urbane worked on a 
film about 
Nicaraguan children intended for 
children in the US; John Bach is a 
painter who spent a total of three years 
in prison for protesting during Viet 
Nam; Dan Botkin makes hacky-sacs, 
and he made lots of them during the 
trip. And we played it everywhere- in 
airports, in the center of Leon-
everywhere. 

Leon, like New Haven, is both a 
university town and a harbor town. 
With a population of 120,000, the city 
lies about 50 miles northwest of 
Managua on the Pacific Coast. The 
streets are 
narrow and 
mostly 
unpaved. The houses are flat-roofed, 
made of either concrete or wooden 
boards nailed together- shanties. 
Graffiti, all of it political, covers the 
outer walls of houses, stores, and 
restaurants. Virtually every type of 
building has some sort of slogan, 
whether for the Liberal Independent 
party, the Marxist/Leninist party, the 
Social Christian party, 
or the 
Sandinistas (FSLN). 

In Leon, for the first couple of weeks 
the construction crew concentrated on 
restoring the roof and the staircase in 
the Museum and on bu ilding 
bookshelves for a childrens' library 
there. Cathy Cowles, a Wesleyan 
student, told me: "This is a project that 
has concrete results. We're working on 
something that's not necessarily a main 
priority of the people of Leon but a 
way of saying we believe in their 
future. That's what a museum is to 
me." When the Museum opens, one 
room will be devoted to art from New 
Haven. 

Six construction people remained in 
Nicaragua until January 19th-the 
rest of us returned on the 13th- in 
order to build latrines for a shanty 
town in Leon called "Heroes and 
Martyrs of the Calvary." Although the 
Sandinista government has given each 
family in this 200 member community 
a 
free 
plot of land 
as part of 
Nicaragua's land reform program, the 
people there cannot afford to build 
more than two latrines and two water 
pumps. The community had some 
building materials but not enough 
labor, 
so 
the construction crew 
volunteered. 

Meanwhile the other half of the 
group met with 
people and 
organizations in the Leon communi!y, 
all in an attempt to get a fuller 
political, social, and economic picture 
of the country, a picture not given in

the US press. We saw first-hand the 
effects of the US embargo, typified by 
a health clinic struggling to survive in 
Subtiava, an impoverished district of 
Leon. There were a handful of doctors 
responsible for an entire community, 
one broken microscope, a lack of 
supplies and space. I wondered if 
this was part of the "Nicaraguan 
juggernaut" that Reagan keeps talking 
about. 

Some of our meetings revealed the 
strengths of the country and the 
achievements of the government. The 
members 
of AMNLAE, 
the 
independent nation a l women's 
organization, were especially 
inspiring. The group's slogan this year 
is "Nobody giv~s an inch, nobody 
yields," and we quickly saw how this 
has been translated into reality, into 
the creation of a strong, influential 
women's movement in Nicaragua. 

There are now sex education programs 
in 
most high schools and 
free, 
government-subsidized day care 
centers. Eighty percent of women work 
outside the home, 
entering the 
professions of law, 
medicine and 
education in full force, and sometimes 
dominating the field. And in the new 
constitution, AMNLAE has left its 
mark: divorced men are now required 
to pay child-support and alimony, and 
women are guaranteed equal rights. 

Yet, one thing I began to notice 
about all of our meetings, whether they 
were with professors at the University 
of Leon or the women at AMNLAE, is 
the way we-as students from Yale-
asked our questions from a limited 
perspective. We'd ask about the lesbian 
and gay movement in Nicaragua or 
about the illegality of abortion, and 
we'd receive non-answers or blank 
stares. It seemed we were tacitly 
implying that the more Nicaraguans 
are like us, the better. Caprice Young, 
(MC '88), put it aptly when she told 
me, "When you ask a farmer what 
democracy is and 
he says, 'It's 
protection for my cows from the 
Contras,' the problem of conveying 
abstract ideologies becomes clear." It 
took us a while, or me at least, to

realize that our priorities 
weren't 
necessarily theirs. The women at 
AMNLAE told us several times that 
yes, they do want to break down 
stereotypes, but right now their main 
priority is supporting those fighting 
the Contras. Also, they still must 
contend with an age-old value 
system- many men won't even let 
their wives attend AMNLAE meetings, 
and some refuse to look after their kids 
if the wife does go. 

We also met with members of the 
government: in Leon, the mayo~· and 
the regional coordinator of the local 
FSLN, and in Managua, a National 
Assembly representative and an editor 
of the newspaper El Nuevo Diario, a 
virtual mouthpiece of the Sandinistas 
(They've got FSLN banners and 
propaganda all over their offices). 
We'd ask about the food shortages or 
about the 
philosophy of the 
Nicaraguan press and its relationship 
to 
the FSLN, and we'd receive 
responses which were either circular 
and contradictory or which completely 
brushed aside our questions as they 
launched into monologues on the 
accomplishments of the FSLN and the 
improvements the country has made 
since the Revolution (the overthrow of 
the Somoza regime in 1979). 

Yet, in talking with the people of 
Leon that we met on the street and 
those that we stayed with, I feel I did 
get a sense of the political climate of the 
country. The idea that the Sandinista 
government doesn't have popular
