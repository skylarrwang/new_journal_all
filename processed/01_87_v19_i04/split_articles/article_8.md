At the shanty town in Leon where members of the delegation built latrines. 

When we arrived in Miami, we 
wanted to eat. We wanted to eat 
cheeseburgers. Even I, who usually 
avoid red meat, fantasized about a 
cheeseburger. We got off the plane, 
stumbled around bleary-eyed through 
the airport, and stared blankly into 
store windows. "There's just so much 
stuff here," I 
remember thinking. 

When we finally found a cafeteria-
style restaurant, I didn't know what to 
choose. After two weeks, I had been 
conditioned to having only three 
options: chicken, fish, or the old stand-
by ... rice and beans. Now the food 
seemed so colorful, so real. We piled 
up our trays, 
grabbing whatever 
looked good. Cheeseburgers, fries, 
huge Cokes, yogurt, fruit, and Dove 
bars filled every inch of table space. I 
took a stack of napkins two inches 
thick. 

I sat in that restaurant, the walls 
were some sort of orange, a couple of 
guys were playing pseudo-tropical 
music on synthesizers, and I began to 
laugh. I looked around-at the food, 
the plastic plants, the people sitting 
alone in formica cubicles- and was 
struck by the absurdity of the scene. 
But the others continued to eat, just 
staring at their plates and munching 
away. I looked at Caprice, she smiled 
and then started to giggle. Soon we 
were all laughing, 
uncontrollably, 
tears streaming down our faces. And 
just as suddenly, we stopped. 

It's been a week since that day, a week 
since we left Nicaragua. We, 15 Yale 
students, went on December 30 as part 
of the New Haven/Leon Sister City 
Project, 
a 
group committed to 
strengthening "global understanding" 
by establishing a connection with the 
people of Leon. The Project, a private 
organization run by Alan Wright,who 
graduated from Yale in December with 
a doctorate in philosophy, has involved 
2000 people, including 130 volunteers 
and four full-time staff members. The 
16th delegation in two years, this was 
the first 
to include a 
group of 
university students. With 30 members, 
it was also the largest to go to Leon 
under the Sister City Project. 

In practical terms this meant that 
students from Yale, Wesleyan, and 
Southern Connecticut, 
a nd 
New 
Haven area residents lived for either 
two or four weeks in the small city 
of Leon. 
There were originally 
two different delegations, one having 
the purpose of "fact-finding" and the 
other devoted to reconstructing the 
Museum of the Americas in Leon. Yet, 
the two groups overlapped-some of 
the students spent time building and 
many of the carpenters, architects, and 
construction people 
attended 
meetings. 

The group as a whole was, unlike 
Yale, truly "diverse." Few of the Yalies 
had known each other before, and the 
construction crew was also a mixed 
bunch. A sampling: Dave Dixon, in 
his fifties, was a graduate of the Yale 
School 
of Architecture; 
Campbell 
Dalgleish went to the Drama School 
and now teaches screenplay writing at 
NYU. A volunteer at the W halley 
Avenue 
Prison 
P oetry 
Center, 
Dalgleish wanted 
to establish 
connection between poets in the New
