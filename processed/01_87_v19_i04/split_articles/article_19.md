Most religious vocations- and 
~ecular ones as well- are subject to 
psychoanalytic interpretations. And 
there is both tension and mutuality 
between religious and psychoanalytic 
interpretations. Spiritual and psycho-
logical wholeness are not necessarily 
parallel paths; frequently they are 
divergent ones, even in conflict. These 
were questions- among many others 
that I would be pursuing. I received 
encouragement and 
support 
from 
Abbot Thomas to 
follow them 
wherever they led, with the hope, of 
course, that I 
would 
respect the 
essential 
mystery of each man's 
vocation. 

I made it clear to Father Tom- in 
the unnecessary way journalists put 
their cards on the table- that I would 
not sanitize the film by presenting him 
or his monks as pious, perfect, or 
serene, with unruffled faith or perfect 
charity- because I didn't believe it. I 
will never forget his merry laugh as he 
said to me, "Neither do I!" He under-
stood instinctively that people would 
be moved by the film, and open their 
hearts and minds to it, only in response 
to honesty, to willingness to risk 
vulnerability, 
doubts, 
fears, 
pain, 
joy- all the 
emotions 
that make 
monkc;, like the rest of us, human. 
It was a 
risk, and there were 
repercussions. 
While 
the general 
response was favorable, there was, 
nonetheless, 
a 
small, 
influential 
minoritv of conservati,·e Catholics who 
not ont'y disapproved of the idea of 
such a film. but were disturbed, even 
scandalized by the sight of monks 
displaying such human emotions. The 
film was denounced from the pulpit of 
St. Patrick's by the Cardinal of New 
York at that time. I heard about these 
criticisms only indirectly, rumors from 
the Catholic grapevine, the occasional 
irate letter, but never from Father 
Tom. He must have had an earful. 

But, he never burdened me with his 
troubles. Again, that superlative tact of 
his, and his loyalty to a commitment 
shone through. 

Father Tom was the true intellectual 
center of the entire experience, pulling 
together the scattered insights of all the 
monks into a cohesive whole. He 
taught me that it is the challenge of our 
time to find God or the ultimate reality 
hidden in the most unexpected places. 
If we identify God with church-going 
or institutions, then in that sense, as 
Our friendship began 
in somewhat unusual 
circumstances, and 
survived - some might 
say - a trial by fire. 
Father Tom believes, God is lost to us 
because the structures are gone. But 
the God who is evervwhere and is 
present in e,·ery facet of secular society 
can be known. And it is only through 
the contemplative dimension, which 
Father Tom describes as a value 
system based on the experience of one's 
own deep self and interior silence, that 
one can perceive this refined level of 
reality in which God is present. In 
contrast to the present climate of 
Catholicism, or at least to the recen t 
expressions of it coming from Rome, 
with emphasis so heavily on insti-
tutional structures and institutional 
truths, Father Tom's insights are not 
only valuable, but courageous as well. 

Father Tom also taught me to think 
about the ordinariness- and therefore 
the accessibility- of the 
monastic 
journey. When I started out on this 
film , Joseph Campell said: "What you 
will learn will be that the monastic 
journey is the specialists' journey. T he 
monks are the heroes of the spiritual 
life in that they let us know what is out 
there beyond the horizon . . . and 
perhaps how to channel some of it into 
our life." While I agree with much that 
Campell said, Father T om enabled me 
to see, on the contrary, both the 
uniqueness and the ordinariness of 
monastic life. 

He 
helped 
me to 
understand how his story- and the 
stories of all the monks- were finally 
the human journey itself, our oldest 
and deepest journey. To know the 
human heart, the nature of good and 
evil, and to search, above all other 
considerations, for the face of God. 

The last words Father Tom said to 
-me as he wa.tched the ABC crew 
packing up our equipment, all of us 
subdued, already homesick for the 
monastery we would soon leave, was 
that there was a monastic dimension in 
all of us, and that he hoped that I 
would come close to understanding 
that idea ... and come a little closer to 
that dimension ir. myself.
