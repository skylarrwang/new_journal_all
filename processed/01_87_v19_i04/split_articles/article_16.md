"They'd say things 
like, 'Are you gay? 
Are you a reformed 
rapist? What's the 
deal?'" 
second wave of the feminist movement 
sort of correspond," he said. "There's a 
very different nature in the rela-
tionship betw'een women and gay 
men." He explained that gay men can 
have a better perspective on women 
than straight men, one that is closer to 
the way in which women perceive 
themselves. 


J ackie Dirks, a teaching assistant for 
di Leonardo's course, suggested that 
the growth of Yale's divestment cam-
paign and the greater visibility of its 
gay community in recent years has 
created a more open atmosphere, 
encouraging 
a 
questioning of 
conventional values. "Whereas last 
year's course enrollment was evenly 
divided among all four classes, this 
year it's overwhelmingly made up of 
seniors," Dirks said. "I'd say they've 
been here three years and things have 
happened that disturbed them, that 
made them realize Yale is a sexist 
place. T hey think, 'If it can be this bad 
here, it must be really terrible other 
places."' 


W hile becoming more politically 
aware after three years at Yale may 
lead some men to explore women's 
stud ies, the number of men enrolled is 
still low. "Oh, it's a fear of ridicule," di 
Leonardo said tersely, when asked why 
more men are not involved. One of her 
students, Adam Kaplan, (TC '88), 
remembered the reactions of· some 
male friends when they learned he was 
taking the class: "They'd say things 
like, 'Are you gay? Are you a reformed 
rapist? What's the deal?"' Larry 
Bencivenga, (ES '87), 
who 
took 
•Feminism and Philosophy" last year, 
explained, "We're not yet at the level 
where men even think Women's Stu-
dies courses are relevant to them." 


The strong reputation of professors 
like Nancy Cott (History), Patricia 
Joplin (English), and di Leonardo, 
who are affiliated with the Women's 
Studies Department, is an added factor 
in the Department's growing popu-
larity. Still, all but five Women's 
Studies courses are cross-listed in other 
departments, 
primarily 
because 
Women's Studies gets so little funding 
from the University that they have to 
share the expenses of paying professors 
and T As with other older and better-
supported departments. 


Some male students in the class 
expressed that they've been able to 
apply what they've learned to their 
daily lives and to their relationships 
with women. "For a couple of years I 
thought of myself as a feminist without 
any sense of what that meant," said 
Steve Kantrowitz, (ES '87). "Since 
taking the course I have a clearer idea. 
It's made me think more concretely 
about things like sharing child care, 
two part-time careers . . . . I think 
most of the guys from the class were 
thinking some of the same things." 


Male reactions 
to the broad 
introductory course were mixed, 
however, 
with some not quite 
understanding di 
Leonardo's 
approach, sometimes feeling singled 
out. The professor explained that she 
finds it valuable to single out male 
students in certain instances. "We were 
having a 
week on 
Violence vs. 
Women, and I made sure to address 
the men in the class," she said. "I 
wanted it not to be a threatening issue, 
but 'Let's talk about what you can do as 
supportive men.'" In section, these 
problems were addressed 
more 
directly. Kantrowitz described how the 
four men in his section, including 
himself, often felt self-conscious and 
wary about possibly interrupting other 
students or monopolizing class 
participation. Dirks admitted that the 
professor and assistants had divided 
the sections of 295a with an eye to "the 
historical tendency of men to dominate 
discussion." 


Some students gave examples of 
instances when gender distinctions in 
class were helpful. George Grohwin 
(TD, '87) recalled a discussion in his 
section about women and the sciences, 
in which the female students were 
arguing that women had to be sexless 
creatures to be taken seriously in the 
scientific arena. He pointed out that 
men involved in science are also often 
perceived as "nerdy" types. "There are 
things that men can't really discuss 
because they have to do with being a 
woman-a woman's experience," said 
Kelley. "So we just had to sit back and 
listen 
But that's 
good, 
it's 
enlightening." 


Di Leonardo envisions her class as 
one that can produce enlightened 
attitudes, and she is 
careful 
to 
emphasize the philosophy behind her 
approach. 
A 
male student once 
accused her, she recalled, of teaching 
the introductory class "from a feminist 
bias." "It's important to historicize," 
she explained later. "(This student] 
read a book on feminist education, and 
later came back and spoke to me again. 
H e said, 'You've really changed my 
mind, and I can say now that fm a 
feminist, 
with 
relaxation."' Di 
Leonardo does not see this year's male 
interest in her course as a fluke, but 
claims that "it's only going to get 
better." 


The surge 
in 
male 
academic 
involvement in women's issues has 
encouraged men to commit themselves 
to projects through the Yale Women's 
Center. 
T im 
Wt,:i~ht (SM 
'88) 
and 
Jay 
Sekor a 
(ES 
'89), 
for example, are male staff members of 
Aurora, the feminist magazine. Wright 
explained that "there's a real psy-
chological barrier about going to the 
Women's Center, a feeling that 'Men 
just don't do that.' Or some people 
think, 'It's the ultimate P.n. thing to 
do, and so I won't do it.'" Yet, Wright is 
an example of one who has tran-
scended that barrier. One male who 
has been active in feminist politics, 
Michael Weingrad, (TC '90), believes 
that academic involvement provides a 
less threatening introduction to 
feminism. "There's a need for both 
kinds of involvement," he said. "(T he 
introductory course] raises awareness 
also." 


Weingrad's involvement 
the 
Coalition for an Educated Choice 
(CEC) began when several friends 
took him to the pro-choice rally in 
Washington t>.C. last March. "I was 
just blown away," he said. "It made 
things very clear to me. But people 
have to understand- it's hard for guys 
because you're in the middle of a rally, 
and you realize that it really isn't 
yours." Nevertheless, Weingrad said 
he was surprised more m en are not 
involved politically in women's issues. 
"If R oe v. Wade is overturned, it will 
affect guys very strongly, in terms of 
the lives of their girlfriends, their 
daughters," he said. "So many people 
in this community are concerned with 
racial oppression abroad, but there's 
still no ERA in the United States." 


Last year's Rape Awareness Project 
(RAP) led several male students to 
form a discussion group. RAP's week-
long series of educational program s 
included taping a red "X" on each spot 
around the campus where a rape had 
taken place. "Rape Awareness Week 
really got a lot of men thinking in ways 
that they hadn't before," said Gevisser. 
In fact, several students organized a 
"For Men Only" discussion g.roup. 
About 60 people showed up. "Ori-
ginally scheduled to be one hour, the 
discussion lasted for over two. "Initially 
a lot of men expressed resentment," 
said Bencivenga. "They felt attacked." 
By the end of the meeting, however, 
many different sentiments had been 
expressed, and most participants 
considered the gathering a success. 


In light of this enthusiasm, R ob 
Spencer, a first-year medical student, 
suggested the formation of a per-
manent discussion group which would 
meet periodically to discuss male views 
on feminist issues. This plan went into 
effect last spring. Table tents 
advertised the new organization as the 
"Men's Caucus" and explained that a 
different issue, from pornography to 
traditional family roles, would be 
discu ssed each week. 


Regular 
attendance sifted down to about ten to 
twelve men. 


Views about the Caucus' ultimate 
goals differed. Some preferred the 
loose structure of a discussion group. 
arguing the necessity of informality.
