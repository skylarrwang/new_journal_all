A Divine, Ordinary Life 
Helen Cutting Whitney, married to Yale 
President Benno C. 
Schmidt Jr., is a 
documentary film director for ABC. In 1981 
she made a film, The Monastery, about 
the lives of Trappist monks living in 
Spencer, Massachusetts. Last fall, the Abbot 
of this monastery, Father Tom Keating, 
spoke at the Yale Divinity School, and 
Whitney introduced him. The following is a 
copy of her speech, the first public address she 
made at Yale. 

I would like to offer a more personal 
than theological introduction to Father 
Tom Keating. Our friendship began in 
somewhat unusual circumstances, and 
survived-some might say-a trial by 
fire ... the making of a film for ABC 
in 1982 about St. Joseph's Abbey. 

Father Tom had been the Abbot of the 
Trappist monastery for over 25 years. 
Getting permission from him to make 
this film and then living through it 
with him was an extraordinarily in-
tense, frequently disruptive, but finally 
unforgettable experience. Unforget-
table in the best sense of the word for 
me ... perhaps in both best and worst 
senses for him. 

"After such 
knowledge," to paraphrase T.S. Eliot, 
"can only come forgiveness." 

I had wanted to make a film about 
this subject for a long while. Religious 
questions have always been of interest 
to me, the network was ready for the 
first time to air such a program, and 
the time felt right. The early 80's 
seemed to be a period-even more 
than the 60's-of restless, even chaotic 
spiritual yearnings; yet paradoxically, 
and this was part of the challenge, I 
also felt it was a time when spiritual 
commitment was difficult, when the 
belief that there was another reality, 
and one of ultimate significance for 
man, was disappearing. 

I came to St. Joseph's Abbey for a 
variety of reasons. I knew that the 
backgrounds of the men there were 
extraordinarily diverse-a diversity 
unequalled in most other monasteries 
-so that the fabric of American life 
would be interwoven in their lives and 
spiritual concerns. More importantly,


I knew that the monastery- under the 
guidance of Abbot Tom Keating- had 
opened itself to modernity by turning 
eastwards in an attempt to discover an 
interior spirituality. Spiritual growth 
and the desire for transformation, 
found at the heart of Eastern religions, 
seem to be lacking in the more 
organized religions of Christianity and 
Judaism. Many of the former Chris-
tians I knew and interviewed felt that 
Christianity had lost the method and 
the meaning of contemplative prayer, 
and because of this was no longer able 
to penetrate their lives. What was 
happening at St. Joseph's suggested to 
me 
that 
what 
was 
lost 
in 
Christianity- at least to some people 
-could be found again. 

He taught me that it 
is the challenge of our 
time to find God or· 
the ultimate reality 
hidden in the most 
unexpected places. 

I remember arriving at St. Joseph's 
on a bleak November morning, gazing 
at the slate grey sky and the stones of 
the monastery. Nervous and appre-
hensive, I felt I was entering an 
unknown world. Abbot Tom greeted 
me, put me immediately at ease, and 
we spent ·much of the day talking. 

It was my first exposure to his 
legendary courtesy. Courtesy born out 
of his ability and his desire to imagine 
in the fullest and most nuanced way 
the other person's situation, a tact best 
described by Rebecca West as "the 
manners of the soul." 

It was also my first experience of 
another one of Father Tom's legendary 
qualities- tough-mindedness. I, the 
experienced interviewer, was clearly 
out-interviewed. I went through the 
most subtle but thorough and rigorous 
examination of my reasons not only for 
making the film but an examination of 
my very soul. Looking back on all the 
documentaries I have produced, and 
all the various permissions I have 
secured, no process was more arduous 
than this one. I ran through a gauntlet 
that involved not only interviews and 
screenings of my films, but a meeting 
-supervised by the Abbot- with the 
entire monastery to answer their 
questions. The meeting was pas-
sionate, 
rowdy and 
surprisingly 
unmonastic, and I remembered being 
exhausted by the debate but delighted 
by 
the 
expressions of wit 
and 
eloquence in the community. 

Father Tom's concerns about the 
film were appropriate and revealing. 
He did not want to be part of a film 
that was a 
behind-the-walls look, 
however complimentary, of an exotic 
world; a network hour of esoterica 
filled with 'pretty pictures and 
marvelous music. He believed that the 
monastery does have meaning for 
modern man, and that our film might 
help suggest some of those meanings. 
He didn't want to play it safe, to preach 
to the converted. If he was going to 
agree to this film, then he wanted to 
reach the uncommitted, the seekers, 
the disaffected. He sought to touch 
people who would never consider join-
ing a monastery, or even making a 
retreat, and yet who would feel a 
nostalgia 
for something 
it 
represents-fidelity, loyalty, sacrifice. He 
even 
wanted 
to reach 
the "me" 
generation, 
for whom 
enclosure, 
chastity, 
even commitment, 
is 
a 
scandal. Why not, he asked, try to 
challenge the congenital narcissism of 
their culture where the search for the 
true self has absurdly taken on some of 
the markings of a religious quest? 

To agree to the film and to allow a 
woman to do it said a great deal about 
the spirit of openness and risk-taking of 
Father Tom and his monastery. To 
follow through with the commitment 
as completely as he did was a mark of 
both his confidence and even his 
courage. I remember being struck by 
both these qualities in our first tough 
discussion about the issue of editorial 
control and also about the questions of 
motivation that I would be raising.
