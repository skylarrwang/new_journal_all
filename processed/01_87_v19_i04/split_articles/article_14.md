worthless, now that I have a career that 
I'd never dreamed I'd be doing." Tuner 
had vowed never to go back to school, 
but his 
Peace 
COrps experience 
encouraged him to pursue graduate 
work 
in agriculture. 
Every time 
Stephen Bingham reads about the 
Third World, he thinks about the 
village in which he lived. "The Peace 
Corps has been a critical element in 
my maintaining a commitment to 
social change," Bingham said. "There's 
an ongoing hum in the back of my 
mind that ther.e are people starving out 
there." 
After their return, many volunteers 
were influenced in their choice of 
professional careers by their exper-
ience in Peace Corps. Nick Allis now 
practices as a public interest lawyer in 
the field of consumer safety. Whitney 
Sanders. went 
to 
Yale School of 
Architecture -after he returned to 
pursue an interest in urban housing: "I 
learned about making do with what 
you're given, through channels that are 
not often used, and again·st pressures 
that you don't normally feel . . . 
making do with materials that are less · 
costly, and coming up with new ways 
to interpret common problems in 
building methods." Sanders had 
dreams about Sierra Leone just after 
his return, and still, not a day goes by 
when he does not think about it. Zyg 
Plater felt he learned something about 
himself that has nothing to do with his 
law school or college degrees. "The 
Peace Corps teaches you what you can 
do as a human being," he said. Each 
little victory he had in Ethiopia, 
however insignificant and however 
unnoticed by anyone else, gave him 
the exhilaration of transcending three 
centuries all by himself. 
Graduates who joined the Peace 
Corps seemed to agree that Yale had in 
some way influenced them to go, 
although they had d ifficulty describing 
exactly how. "There were things at 
Yale that allowed me to see the Peace 
Corps as an option, things at Yale that 
allowed me to make the Peace Corps a 
valuable experience," explained 
Tuner. Some volunteers speak of 
Zygmunt Broel-Plater, Yale Law School, 
Class of '68.

having learned self-reliance. Perhaps 
the rigors of Yale encourage evaluation 
of one's potential. Perhaps Yale does a 
good job of reminding students that 
they don't live in only one world, and 
that their lives don't have to be two-
dimensional. Certainly the diversity of 
student experience of which 
Yale 
presidents have spoken so highly 
continues to be a part of our education. 
"Yale teaches you to be versatile and 
multifaceted," Johnson said. "I got that 
from my own experience of going from 
my jock friends on the hockey team to 
the El~zabethan club to discuss Dante's 
Inferno." Diversity at Yale is a far cry 
from 
the 
cultural differences 
volunteers encounter while walking 
miles of dirt road in the Third World, 
thinking of their home town. But Yale 
might teach the need to confront 
diversity and make it a part of one's life 
in order to continue learning. 
Perhaps experiencing Yale's 
diversity 
challenges students 
continue experimenting with their lives 
once they walk through its gates for the 
last time. The Peace Corps is one 
means through which graduates go on 
learning about themsel_ves and their 
world. When Zyg Plater was at Yale 
Law School before entering the Corps, 
he came across many students he 
characterizes as "sodden preppies

going on to become mindless rich 
men." But he also found people similar 
to those he would later meet in the 
Corps- people with "unconventional 
things going on inside them," some of 
whom still cared about making a 
difference. The experiences of Yale 
and the Peace Corps are inseparable 
for Plater, because from both he 
learned 
importance of doing 
something special. 
Because Plater 
went into the Peace Corps, he saw his 
possibilities open instead of close. "I 
might have gone to Wall Street if I 
hadn't done the Peace Corps," Plater 
said. 
Now a professor at Boston 
College Law School, he likes to tell his 
students three things that he believes 
capture what he learned from both 
Yale and the Peace Corps: "You're here 
to make a life as well as a living, and if 
you're lucky, a difference." 
Catharine Steadman's parents have 
arrived as the late afternoon sun 
streams into Pierson College, and they 
stand listening to her speak. She knows 
more of what to expect than did the 
first generation of Peace Corps 
volunteers. She explains that she does 
not hope to accomplish Great Things 
because the Peace Corps has warned 
her that she probably will not. A friend 
who served in the Corps recently wrote 
Steadman: "You realize how you're 
changing much faster than you see 
how they're changing." Though she is 
aware of these things, Steadman knows 
as little as other graduates have known 
upon leaving school. A last question as 
Steadman walks through the gate to 
Park Street: How does she feel? She 
smiles. "Pm sort of in shock. We leave 
the fifth of July."
