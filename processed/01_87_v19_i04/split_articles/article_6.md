Shrugging Off 
Convention 
Martha Brant 
Arthur Rubin (CC, '89) loves to talk 
about politics, but during his two years 
at Yale, the fast talking, aggressive 
sophomore has had a hard time finding 
people who will listen. "I find the 
political climate at Yale a little bit 
oppressive; people don't really listen to 
what I have to say," he said. "A lot of 
the conservatives d ismiss my views as 
being kind of wacko and the left can't 
stand me." This philosophy · which 
Rubin claims has earned such enmity 
from 
both 
sides of the 
political 
s p ec t rum- objectivism.:_ was 
developed by author Ayn Rand in the 
1940's and has enjoyed limited but 
consistent support ever since. Rand's 
death in 1982 and the subsequent 
reprinting of much of her work have 
sparked 
a 
renewed 
interest in 
objectivism. 
In 
D ecember,1985, 
Rubin and several other students 
formed the Objectivism Study Group 
at Yale, dedicated to defending and 
preserving 
R and's unique 
but 
controversial philosophy. 
There have been objectivists at Yale 
since the height of R and's popularity in 
the late 1950's. During that time 
students created objectivism discussion 
clubs on many college campuses; other 
Randians circulated taped lectures and 
subscribed to objectivist publications. 
Much of this activity exists at Yale 
today. T he current study group meets 
for dinner about every other week, 
primarily 
to 
discuss the 
applications of the philosophy. These 
dinner meetings usually include three 
or four avid objectivists, a few main-
stream conservative stragglers, and 
occasionally some liberals eager for 
argument. The study group has also 
invited editors of objectivist 
publications to give speeches and has 
tried to add an objectivist seminar to 
the curriculum, an idea which Director 
of Undergraduate Studies of Philos-
ophy, R.I.G. Hughs, rejected, calling 
the philosophy "disreputable." 
Rand presented objectivism in her 
two best- selling novels, 
The 
Fountainhead ( 1943) and Atlas Shrugged 
(1957), as well as in her other fiction 
and non-fiction essays. She arranged 
her philosophy into four strands: 
metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and 
politics. Rand summarized the meta-
physical strain 
in 
her statement, 
"existence exists." Objectivism is based 
on the assumption that humankind can 
understand the world through rational 
thought. Thus Rand's epistemology -
her theory of the 
nature of 
knowledge-centers on reason. The 
character John Galt in Atlas Shrugged 
best explains the objectivist ethic: "I 
swear- by my life and my love of 
it- that I will never live for the sake of 
another man, nor ask another man to 
live for mine." Rand's political vision 
includes 
limited government 
structure and 
pure laissez-faire 
capitalism. 


Although this philosophical outline 
does not prescribe any specific political 
affiliation, most active objectivists at 
Yale are also members of the Party of 
J I 
Ayn Rand, who gained international 
attention for 
h er controversial 
philosophy. 
"I swear-by my life 
and my love of 
it- that I will never 
live for the sake of 
another man, nor ask 
another man to live 
for mine." 
the Right (POR). T here have been 
objectivists in the POR since the 
founding of the party in the early 
1950's. 

Although objectivists have 
always been a minority, they are very 
active in party leadership. 

Both R ubin, just elected Secre-
tary/Treasurer, and the previous party 
chairman, Todd Lencz (SM, '89), try 
to follow Rand's theories, explaining 
that objectivists do not fit the standard 
"conservative" label 
but feel 
comfortable in the PO R because it 
espouses no official doctrine and serves 
as a debating society. Objectivists 
accept some political philosophies from 
each end of the political spectrum. On 
the one hand, they agree with the left's 
fight 
for 
civil 
liberties and 
its 
denunciati.on of state- imposed 
morality, while also supporting the 
right's firm defense of property rights 
and capitalism. If forced to classify 
themselves 
politically, 
objectivists 
generally refer to themselves as right 
wing because of their overriding 
commitment to capitalism. 

Students in the POR do not always 
welcome 
this 
support 
from the 
objectivist element. Within the party, 
good-natured disagreement exists. 
John Brewer (SM, '87), the newly 
elected chairman of the POR 
exclaimed, "I'm not a Randhead, not

me." His brown hair hanging well 
below his shoulders, Brewer proudly 
pointed out that both he and Rubin 
have a pierced ear- it is the first time 
in the history of the party that two of its 
leading members wear an earring. 
"The POR is not an ideologically 
monolithic group," Brewer said, "but 
one of the problems with objectivists in 
general and in dealing with them is 
that theirs is a very dogmatic system 
although it claims to be completely 
rational." 

Objectivists like to take advantage of 
any opportunity to 
challenge 
traditional conservative views within 
the POR. Rubin for one has become 
frustrated with the complexities he 
finds in conservatism: "Conservatism 
as 
whole 
is 
mass 
of 
contradictions- it's terrible." The new 
religious right, for example, appalls 
him: "Religion is the key problem with 
conservatism. 
Because of their 
religious beliefs, conservatives seem to 
think that their morality is the right 
morality and they should legislate it to 
us." Religious faith is contrary to 
Randian thought and the objectivists 
strongly 
oppose alliances between 
religion and politics. 

In fact, objectivists oppose 
government intervention in the realm 
of any moral issue. They abhor the 
Reagan Administration's anti-abortion 
position as well as much of its Third 
World policy against 
communism. 
Rubin said that "the United States' 
objective in foreign policy should be 
the protection of human rights. I think 
it was wrong for the United States to 
support the Shah, 
Battista, 
and 
Somoza (military dictators in Iran, 
Cuba, and Nicaragua) because we fail 
to see the forest through the trees. The 
primary concern we 
should have 
should be the protection of human 
rights. If the United States supports a 
government just because it is anti-
communist, but disregards human 
rights, then we seem to have missed 
the point." Although this idea seems 
similar to liberal beliefs, it is not rooted 
in the same philosophy. By objectivist 
standards, 
communism 
is not a 
legitimate governmental system since

philosophy: "If 
is not, it's a fascist. 
it suppresses individual rights. 

Although 
VIew 
communism as "evil," they feel that 
American foreign 
policy makers 
should 
formulate 
policies 
more 
sensitive to human rights violations 
than 
to hypothetical communist 
infiltration. 

Despite the apparent similarities be-
tween some objectivist and standard 
liberal views, Rubin claimed, "Most 
liberal Yalies don't have much interest 
in the Objectivism Study Group. 
People don't know what it is but will 
criticize it anyway. They say, 'Oh, 
Ayn Rand's a fascist.' For Christ's 
sake, if there is anything she is not, it's 
a fascist." Robert Larsen (BK, '87), 
former Liberal Party Chairman and 
current Vice President of the Yale 
College Democrats, speaks for one 
element of the politically active liberals 
on campus. "We are diametrically 
opposed to their beliefs. Objectivists 
have one big solution which they hope 
solves problems instead of dealing with 
the problems. Liberals have a more 
realistic outlook." Rubin disagreed, 
arguing that objectivism does in fact 
provide the tools to find realistic 
answers in a complex world. "The 
biggest thing you'll come 
across, 
. especially at a place like Yale which is 
pretty liberal, is what Rand called the

'cult of moral greyness'-everything is 
grey, there is no right and wrong, 
everything is r~Jative. Sometimes an 
issue is pretty tough to judge and there 
are grey areas, but we believe that 
there is right and wrong, there is good 
and evil, there is black and white." 

Associate Philosophy Professor John 
Fischer and other philosophers 
challenge that clear division. "I think it 
· is fair to say that most philosophers 
reject this as an oversimplified view of 
the world," Fischer said. Although not 
a Randian expert, Fischer is very 
familiar with libertarianism, a branch 
of conservatism with some similarities 
to objectivism. He does not dismiss 
objectivism outright as 
many 
philosophers do, but does debate its 
reasoning. In his peaceful office in SSS 
overlooking the Long Island Sound, 
Fischer explained, "Many philosophers 
believe that the only way in which 
objectivism is plausible is to make 
assumptions that are naive and 
unrealistic." 

Objectivists and mainstream 
philosophers differ fundamentally on 
issues concerning human nature and 
on the political role of government. 
Objectivists believe that 
social 
programs are immoral. They argue 
that such programs reduce incentive 
and create a 
cycle of welfare 
generations. "The government is not 
the babysitter of the people," said 
Rubin. Objectivists would like to 
dismantle public policy programs such
