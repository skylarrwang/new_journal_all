because we were white people, and 
white people were bound to succeed," 
he explained. For Bingham, the Peace 
Corps, 
which brought general 
intentions and few real skills to a 
culture where colonialism and the 
Catholic Church had destroyed black 
peoples' self-esteem for generations, 
could only be counterproductive. 


Since its more naive beginnings, the 
Corps has attempted to improve its 
efficacy by emphasizing the need for 
practical skills and background in 
public service in its recruitment. When 
David Foltz ('77) went to Rwanda to 
teach advanced English conversation 
to university students, he already had 
three years of teaching experience in 
Europe, experience which he believes 
made him an attractive candidate for 
the 
Corps. 


Catharine Steadman, 
thou gh she had been only a distant 
adm irer of Dwight Hall community 
service, had gone to a high school 
where such service was required; in 
addition, she too had a year of teaching 
experience during her Junior year 
abroad. Now using the slogan. "The 
Toughest job You'll Ever Love", the 
Peace Corps offers 
programs in 
forestry, agriculture, health, business 
and seven other fields in addition to 
teaching and English language 
programs. At the same time, the Peace 
Corps has become highly selective and 
competitive. A vague interest in doing 
good and in having an adventure are 
no longer enough; while most college 
graduates are slated for teaching 
programs, the Peace Corps also seeks 
people with technical skills. Allis, 
J ohnson and Stevens joined the Peace 
Corps with relative ease. But in 1986, 
of 13,000 who applied to the Peace 
Corps, 3,000 were accepted. Although 
Yale received 27 of those offers, even a 
Yale graduate like Steadman can no 
longer simply waltz into the Corps. 


The process 
requires a 
14-page 
application, eight recommendations, 
and a lengthy interview. As a result of 
this competitiveness, volunteers are 
now more qualified- if one can ever be 
qualified for the experience they will 
face. Through a two to three month 
training program, the Peace Corps

now attempts to prepare volunteers 
project, but had himself transferred to 
more thoroughly. During this training, 
another project working with poor 
the volunteers take courses in the 
upland farmers that better suited his 
language, politics, history, and culture 
interests. Tuner's pragmatism led him 
of a region, and may also have on-the-
to join despite the fact that he didn't 
job or technical training to familiarize 
even agree with the Peace Corps as an 
them with their specific jobs and help 
institution; 
he 
had 
to justify 
them "brush up" on their skills. 


As the Peace Corps has become 
more skill-oriented, volunteers have 
realized that they can use it to acquire 
valuable training and 
experience. 
After becoming interested 
tn 
anthropology at Yale, Allen Tuner 
('70) had gone to Mexico to study 
Mayan hieroglyphics. That exposure 
increased his desire to have a cross-
cultural learning experience at the 
grass-roots 
level. 
He eventually 
applied to the Peace Corps for very 
practical reasons: he wanted to travel, 
and could not find a non-professional 
job that would allow him to save 
enough money to do it on his own. The 
Peace Corps would not only support 
him in another country. it would train 
him in some practical skiJls that he 
sought in either health or agriculture. 
Assigned to the Dominican Republic, 
he was slated for a rice irrigation

was famous for 
sending volunteers 
home in strait jackets.

The three hour 
videotape that the Peace Corps shows 
during recruitment, or the warnings 
and scenarios that you receive in 
training, cannot prepare you for this; 
after three days, maybe after you have 
stepped over your ftrst dead body, then 
you start to learn what numbers mean. 


For Zyg Plater, 
Ethiopia was a 
museum society, Haile Selassie had 
ruled by a kind of divine right since 
1908. "Having gone to fine schools 
with highfalutin' ideals, volunteers 
would go to villages where the main 
issue is if the chief guy is going to kill 
someone.- anrl if he does, he will do it 
to 
impress you." Plater compared 
going to Ethiopia with stepping into 
16th-century Europe. 


Not everyone can handle the shock 
of going into such a foreign culture and 
being left to make do as they can. In 
the sixties Somalia was notorious for 
sending volunteers home in straight 
jackets. Plater met a fellow volunteer 
in a desolate part of Ethiopia and asked 
directions from him; though the man 
had probably not seen another white 
person in months, he only responded 
with "yes." "He was fried," Plater said. 
•He'd gotten involved, realized he was 
not going to change the world, and that 
his presence was ambiguous." The 
most common reaction to culture 
shock is that volunteers go home. Of 
Whitney Sanders' Peace Corps .dass 
that went abroad in June of 1981-', 40 
percent returned to the United States 
at some point before the end of their 
two years. In any given year, the Peace 
Corps generally ends up sending 30 
percent of the volunteers home early. 


Living in the Third World 
blemished the United States' image in 
many volunteers' eyes. Sanders 
recalled passing a hut in Sierra Leone 
where the only light came from a 
television set showing "Charlie's 
Angels"-an image of the United 
States that, for an American, seemed 
grotesque in a place where no one ever 
had enough food to eat. Living in 
villages without running water or 
electricity sensitized volunteers to the 
States' enormous waste of the world's 
resources. In Sierra Leone, Bingham 
saw the "quiet dignity" of rural people 
who have learned the cycle of their 
lives: "It's a humbling experience for 
those of us who live in the microwave 
society." Foltz experienced a similar 
disillusionment with American con-
sumption and complacency. One of 
the first things he did upon returning 
to the States was attend a Harvard-
Yale football game. "Sitting in the 
stands, I thought, 'I haven't seen so 
many white people in two years'. . . 
everyone seemed so irrelevant, but 
then so was I, and I · had been in 
Rwanda." 


Though a goal of the Peace Corps 
was to "improve" the image of the 
United States abroad, it often has the 
inverse effect, revealing to volunteers 
the reality of the U .. S.'s good intentions 
and interest in international 
development. Bingham believes that 
the Peace Corps is a logical extension 
of our foreign policy, which, rather 
tttan allowing Third World countries 
their own path of development, 
encourages a dependence on the inter-
national market and on cash crops, of 
which the United States may be a 
prime consumer. 


"Self-sufficient 
farming is disappearing in Africa," he 
explained. "People are now starving 
where 50 years ago they supported 
themselves." Similarly, Zyg Plater saw 
the Peace Corps as a tool for a kind of 
welfare colonialism that was practiced 
most under the Nixon administration. 
"If those countries had economic 
power, the US would snuff it out." A 
volunteer serving with Plater in 
Ethiopia discovered that the country 
possessed ideal climate and soil for 
growing oranges in the off-season, 
when oranges in Israel or the Arab 
countries are not yet ripe. The 
American Embassy prevented any 
development of the idea, because 
coffee is Ethiopia's major export crop 
and the US its major buyer. "So long 
as it had one crop, it was going to be 
beholden to the US," Platter 
continued. "Oranges would bring 
Ethiopia into a diversified market, and 
that was politically disequilibrating." 


Impressions of their time abroad 
remains with volunteers, in ways that 
are often impossible to describe. "The 
things I was learning then are the most 
important things I ever learned," 
Tuner said. "But I can't really say what 
they are. 
Professionally they are
