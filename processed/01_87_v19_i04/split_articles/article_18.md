"We approach it from 
different angles, but 
it's always the same. 
What does it mean to 
be a man, how are 
we indoctrinated?" 

"The point of it wasn't to figure out 
what's 'right,' just to clarify what we 
felt individually," said Jonathan Reff 
(TC '88). "The idea wasn't to change 
anybody ... The issue was the whole 
question of masculinity in society. The 
role of women has changed, but I don't 
think the notion of masculinity really 
has. That's always the issue for the 
group. We approach it from different 
angles, but it's the same thing. What 
does it mean to be a man, how are we 
indoctrinated?" 

Bencivenga, 
however, 
frustrated by what he saw as the 
Caucus' passivity. "My problem with it 
was that I felt all they wanted to do was 
just sit around and talk," he said. In 
retrospect he feels less angry about the 
lack of political commitment, ex-
plaining that some of the members of 
the Caucus were involved with the 
divestment campaign and that 
everyone involved was forced to make 
choices. "In the end," he said, "it's 
important just to get men and women 
working together on these issues." 

Although the creators of the Men's 
Caucus did not anticipate that women 
would want to take part in their 
discussions, the group later decided to 
welcome 
interested women. 
Some 
women, including Renee Schwalberg 
(ES '87) and Pam Thompson (MC 
'87), co-editor of Aurora, did attend. 
Thompson remembered one of her 
visits to the Caucus: "I made a face 
about something, and this guy just 
turned and said, 'Look! You're looking 
at me! You're judging me!' It turned 
out to be nothing . . . But it's really 
scary - the insecurity, the hostility, 
and the fear involved in it." 

Schwalberg also recalled having 
difficulty at first with the unusual 
format of the Caucus. "I went to one 
meeting and gave a little talk about 
feminist theory," she explained. "But 
afterwards there was a very strong 
reaction against talking politics. Most 
of the men in the room were straight-
-I think all but one- and it turned 
into a discussion of . . . who makes the 
first move and why." She laughed. 
"The next meeting was on the family, 
and that was better. It wasn't just 
talking about 
girlfriends-- it 
talking about mothers, sisters. 
When the discussions were directed, 
they were more productive." She, 
however, still maintains Bencivenga's 
earlier stance. "I do wish it had been 
more activist. There are things these 
men could be doing." 

Their interest piqued by positive 
groups like the Men's Caucus, some 
men have even committed themselves 
to helping victims of sexual assault. 
Bencivenga, for instance, works for 
both the New Haven and Yale rape 
crisis centers. The former is a large 
organization 
which 
offers training 
programs each semester; the latter 
currently boasts 
three 
members, 
despite extensive publicity. Some of 
the more active members of last year's 
Men's Caucus, which did not resume 
its meetings last September, are now 
attempting to revive the organization. 

Mark Gevisser still chuckles when he 
thinks about his antics on stage at the 
coffeehouse, but he will also talk about


it a minute later in a serious tone. He 
addresses 
one of the 
potentially 
negative aspects of having men involve 
themselves in Women's Studies. "What 
happens is that people appropriate 
other people's problems, which isn't 
good," he explains. "I mean, I think 
it's much better to have men knitting 
than running around with guns or 
something. But it's important to poke 
fun to see that we still have an 
incredibly 
long way 
to go. 
We 
shouldn't be complacent. It annoys me 
when men - including myself, because 
that skit was definitely partly a self-
parody- get complacent. I said once to 
someone, 'Well, as a feminist . . .' and 
then I thought, 'Wait a minute, who 
are you to say you're a feminist?"' He 
pauses for a moment, then clarifies: "I 
think men can be their own kind of 
feminist. But I think it's a really bad 
kind of sexism to think men can have 
the same feminist cause as women. 
There are certainly things men can do, 
but always with the perspective that 
they're men. The skit was poking fun 
at losing that perspective." 

While di Leonardo encourages male 
students to take her class, she does 
recognize that some of them may feel 
unwelcome in a Women's Studies 
course. But how does one go about 
making a male student feel at home in 
a Women's Studies class? "I hear that 
in section the TA's still ask for the 
'male point of view,"' said Schwalberg. 
"It won't work that way.'' One student 
suggested that whenever men choose to 
deal with these issues, they must 
always confront 
their maleness, 
perhaps much more so than they are 
otherwise forced to in a traditional 
scholastic environment. Speaking 
about his experiences with Intro-
ductory Women's Studies, 
Adam 
Kaplan remembered a passage from 
Virginia Woolf's A Room of One's Own: 
"She says something about how women 
are locked out, but perhaps it is worth 
noting that men are locked in."
