Since 
she 
was 
eight, 
Cathanne 
Steadman ('86) has wanted to join the 
Peace Corps. She remembers hearing 
adults speak of it in glowing terms: "It 
seemed like such a neat thing to do." 
Now much older, Steadman sits on a 
bench in the Pierson College courtyard 
two days before Yale commencement 
exercises. She pulls her light brown 
hair off of her shoulders, clasps and 
unclasps her hands, and looks around 
occasionally, 
awaiting her parents' 
arrival. How does she feel about 
graduating? "I'm terrified," she says, 
shrugging her shoulders. A few days 
after Steadman leaves Yale, she will 
train at the Peace Corps center in 
Philadelphia, and in a few weeks, she 
will be teaching English in Zaire. 
Though she says she is scared, her gaze 
is steady as she explains her reason for 
volunteering two years of her life to 
live in the Third World. Having grown 
up with the Quaker tradition of public 
service and pacifism, Steadman feels a 
moral obligation to "do something 
good for someone." She believes the 
United States should have a national 
service requirement. At the same time, 
Steadman has a practical reason for 
volunteering in the Peace Corps. 
Unlike many of her classmates, she 
knows she doesn't want to go to 
business or law school. The Peace 
Corps will test her interest in teaching 
as a career. Laughing, she says, "This 
is a 
highly professional step I'm 
taking." 

Catharine Steadman was one of 27 
Yale seniors and graduates to receive 
offers from the Peace Corps in 1986. 
Though every year we hear of the rush 
of corporate-minded seniors to Wall 
Street, or of hundreds of seniors 
submitting resumes 
to investment 
banking programs, the Peace Corps, 
not M organ Stanley, has consistently 
been the largest employer of Yale 
graduates. 

"There is an abiding 
interest here in public service," Susan 
Hauser, dean of Career Services, in-
sisted. In fact, in the 25 year history of 
the Corps, Yale has been the largest 
supplier of volunteers, sending over 
five hundred graduates to serve in the 
Third World. Why do Yalies volunteer 
for the Peace C orps? 

Phillip Stevens ('62) had what he 
called the "standard attitude" towards 
his two years in Nigeria with the Peace 
Corps. He understood vaguely that he

was going over to do good, but the 

\lege 
accepted. 

Walter Johnson ('64) served in 
Uganda from 1964-66 more out of a 
spirit for adventure than anything else. 
The Corps appealed to him as a new 
idea; an exotic opportunity. At the 
same time, he felt some obligation 
towards his country, though not as 
strongly as Steadman: "I don't know 
where I got that feeling. Perhaps it was 
more common at the time than it is 
now." Certainly the popularity of 
President Kennedy and the publicity 
surrounding the Corps gave wide 
circulation to values of patriotism, 
service and sacrifice- if the details of 
who was being served abroad, and 
how, remained more amorphous. The 
Peace Corps provided an excellent

teaches the individual that in using the 
extraordinary resources of this institution to 
develop his own potential, he learns how to 
use himself in the service of the larger human 
community."

up with 
s. To students 
a closed, elite community like 
Yale, the Peace Corps offered the 
chance to practice their idealism in the 
"real world". In the summer after 
graduation, Nick Allis ('64) joined 
many of his classmates trying to 
register black voters in Mississippi. 
AJJis had come from a Christian "do-
gooder" background, and the civil 
rights movement fulfilled his need to 
serve others as well as his need to 
engage in some kind of action. "There 
were some real political issues being 
discussed and then acted upon, with 
some risk to the participants," Allis 
recalled. In retrospect, Allis believes 
that his sense of isolation from these 
issues at Yale provided a positive sort 
of frustration, an incentive to become 
involved in social issues. "I did feel 
Yale was enclosed, and wasn't directly 
a part of these things. But then, that's 
what college is for, isn't it? To give you 
a chance to learn and think." Allis' 
experience with civil rights activism led 
to his decision to join the Peace Corps. 
Compared to his experiences in Missis-
sippi, the Peace Corps was a dis-
appointment. Teaching in a secondary 
school in Nigeria, Allis felt none of the 
heady excitement he had known in 
Mississippi. "Teaching is teaching, 
even if it's in rural west Africa. It didn't 
have the intensity of being on the front 
line of a struggle." If Allis and the 
many other idealistic volunteers who 
first joined the Peace Corps were "wide 
eyed", they soon found that neither the 
Third World nor the Peace Corps had 
any room for great causes of social 
change. 

As part of the first generation of 
Peace Corps volunteers, these three 
men 
reflected the naivete that 
characterized the early years of the 
Peace Corps itself. The first volunteers 
were typically recent college graduates 
who had studied liberal arts, and were 
figuring out what to do with their lives. 
T hough 
Congress 
had 
considered 
similar ideas in the late 1950s, the idea 
of the Peace Corps became popular 
only after Kennedy raised it in his 
campaign for the Presidency. The 
early enthusiasm for the Peace Corps, 
strongest among students, was closely 
tied to Kennedy's image: his idealism 
and youth encouraged a spirit of 
patriotism, service, and sacrifice, and 
promised adventure to pioneers of the 
President's "New Frontier." 

If volunteers were more ambivalent

about their actual service than their 
own ideals or personal needs, their 
views reflected the values of the Peace 
Corps itself. The Corps emphasized its 
benefits for the United States as much 
as its benefit for the countries it was 
serving. The Peace Corps Act of 1961 
o u tlined 
three goals that 
have 
remained the Corps' governing ideals. 
By sending American "volunteers for 
peace" to Africa, Latin America, and 
Asia, the Corps would aid developing 
countries with trained manpower, 
create a better understanding of the 
United States in those countries, and 
increase Americans' understanding of 
fore ig n 
cultures. 
Rather 
than 
perpetuate the image of the Ugly 
American, going abroad with little 
concern for native language or culture, 
imposing his own plans for change 
with cigar in hand, the Peace Corps 
would help Third World development 
on an individual level, encouraging 
native 
communities 
to 
help 
themselves. The Peace Corps does not 
decide where projects are conducted, 

"O n your willingness not merely to serve one 
or two years in the Service, but on your 
willingness to contribute part of your life to 
this country, I think will depend the answer 
whether we as a free society can compete."

or which volunteers will participate; 
countries submit requests for 
volunteers and then choose from 
among those that the Peace Corps 
nominates. 

A concern for the United States' hnage 
abroad dominated the goals of the 
Peace Corps. The priority of that 
concern in shaping the early Corps was 
confirmed by a selection policy that 
sought out educated Americans more 
than Americans who had concrete 
skills to offer developing countries. 
"The Peace Corps in the early days had 
the feeling that it was Kennedy's 
progeny. It was more an elitist appeal 
to people with liberal arts backgrounds 
to get their hands dirty," Stephen 
Bingham ('64) 
observed. "It was 
considered important that liberal arts 
majors would bring a set of values that 
others would not." When Allis, 
Stephens, and Johnson were selected 
to teach in schools in Africa, none of 
them had had teaching experience; but 
they were all Yale graduates, bright 
and motivated liberal arts majors, and 
therefore considered the most suitable 
to represent the United States and the 
most capable of effecting change.

Once in the Third World, Peace 
Corps volunteers faced tremendous 
cultural 
differences. 
Part 
of the 
problem was that volunteers had 
difficulty 
adapting 
their 
communities and being accepted as 
equals. In Uganda, Walter Johnson 
saw one of his students from secondary 
school push a woman off a bus; the 
student believed that he was privileged 
because the white man was teaching 
him. Johnson realized that education 
was not giving his students a greater 
sense of responsibility for their society. 
Instead, they would return from school 
vacations boasting about how they had 
avoided work. Twenty years later, 
Johnson think's little of the impact he 
had as a teacher in Africa. But at the 
time he remained at a distance from 
his community, undoubtedly making 
his task all the harder. In his little free 
time, he kept to himself, reading crates 
of books provided to him through the 
Peace Corps. He also played on a 
rugby team with players from Britain, 
and toured Africa to play against 
native teams. 

Even when volunteers actively 
sought integration into the ir 
communities, they found themselves 
unable to help because they lacked the 
necessary skills and cultural insight. 
Bingham served in an experimental 
Corps program 
in community 
development in Sierra Leone from 
1965-1967. There with his wife as an 
"outside agent of change", Bingham 
was to live in the commumty to 
encourage initiative in the native 
population for finding new solutions to 
their problems of daily life. The project 
epitomized the Peace Corps' approach 
to development; volunteers were 
passively involved, and yet were meant 
to have a positive influence, provoking 
change without directing it. Bingham 
became quickly disillusioned with the 
program and the Corps, finding that 
he could offer little to the community 
that helped the community develop 
itself. "They accepted ideas that we 
suggested not as inquiring minds but
