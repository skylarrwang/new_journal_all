Professor Micaela di L eonardo: Last 
semester over 40 men took her Women's 
Studies class. 
The scene opens with two men sitting 
in easy chairs, knitting. 
A Joan 
Armatrading record plays softly in the 
background. All is calm, until the 
argument begins. 
It starts ofT innocently enough, one 
man announcing that it was he who 
decided to name their cats "Sappho" 
and "Julia Kristeva," while the other 
complains 
that 
he had favored 
"Suzanne Vega." "Well, I took the cat 
to Washington for the March for 
Women's Lives," huffs the first. 
And the war is on. "I only read 
poetry by women," one of the men 
declares. 
"I only read lesbian poetry," the 
other man snaps. 
"I only read black lesbian poetry." 
"I am a black lesbian poet!" 
The subject 
turns to Women's 
Studies classes. Who has taken more? 
"I haven't taken a course with a man 
yet," one of the men announces 
proudly. The other one snorts. "I really 
understand women," he says. "I'm gay. 
I share the same marginalized position 
in the patriarchal power structure. 
We're both oppressed." He accuses the 
other man of being competitive and 
unsympathetic. How to resolve this 
issue? The scene ends with both men 
rolling on the floor, one experiencing 
menstrual cramps and the other labor 
pains, while both yell, "I want to be a 
woman!"

Last October, 
at the coffeehouse 
sponsored by Aurora, Yale's feminist 
magazine, Mark Gevisser, (SY '87) 
and Phil Auerswald, (PC '87) called 
their performance "the sensitive man 
sketch." They parodied character-types 
that most of the audience could easily 
recognize. At Yale, the "sensitive man" 
takes. his own interest in women's 
issues too seriously, comes to believe, 
as in the skit, that sensitivity towards 
women's problems is an adequate 
substitute for actual experience. 
Feminists have always debated over 
the role men can or should play in the 
women's movement, and exaggerated 
stereotypes like the "sensitive 
man" often overshadow the finer points 
of that debate. At Yale, the issue 
remains a chaJlenging one, particularly 
in light of the fact that the male 
enrollment in Women's Studies 295a, 
the major's introductory course, rose 
roughly 700 percent this year. Last 
semester over 40 men took the course, 
which also doubled in size to 165 
people. 
While 
total 
male 
enrollment 
probably does not 
constitute a 
campus-wide trend 
towards 
feminism, 
percentage 
increase is large enough to warrant a 
closer look at what was behind it and 
what it may suggest. 
Micaela di Leonardo, 
assistant 
professor of anthropology, has taught 
introductory 
women's 
studies 
course since last year, and she's happy 
about 
the sudden surge 
m 
mal<" 
enrollment. Eager to talk about it, she 
suggested a possible explanation for 
the new numbers. "A lot of male 
students knew about me because of 
[my involvement in] the divestment 
campaign," she said. "These were 
people who were already concerned 
about larger issues of social inequity. 
They knew gender was related to these 
issues and wanted to get the facts." Di 
Leonardo has encouraged students to 
see this relation through talks she has 
given at PROP, the pre-freshman 
orientation program for 
m inority 
students. She recalled how, after one of 
her speeches, a black student came up 
to her and asked her point-blank why 
he should be a feminist. "I had him 
imagine for a minute that I was in his 
position," she explained. "As a black 
man, I might say, 'I know there is a 
connection between these two great 
historical evils. I don't want to be 
feared on the street. I want my girl 
children to grow up and be able to 
realize their potential. I want to be an 
equal partner."' Drawing these 
parallels between sexual and racial 
discrimination was an important part 
of di Leonardo's apprÂ·oach to teaching 
the introductory class during her firsl 
year. 
A sophomore taking the intro-
ducwry course, Chris Kelley, (TD 
'89), also believes that the relationship 
between oppressed groups has 
contributed to the popularity of the 
class. "The gay movement and the
