**Title: The New Journal Mission Statement and Publication Information**
**Author:  The New Journal**
**Page number(s): 47**

The New Journal was founded in 1967, under the following mission statement: “This university has once again reached that stage in 
history when people are talking about the New Yale, presumably to be distinguished from the Old Yale, which in its own day was 
presumably considered new. Wishing to share in this modernity, we have chosen The New Journal as the name for our publication. 
Besides, things seemed slow around here.”

Today, The New Journal is published five times during the academic year by The New Journal at Yale, Inc. One thousand copies of each 
issue are distributed free to members of the Yale and New Haven community. The New Journal is printed by TCI 
Press, Seekonk, Massachusetts; bookkeeping and billing services are provided by Colman Bookkeeping of New 
Haven. Office Address: P.O. Box 3311, New Haven, CT 06515.
