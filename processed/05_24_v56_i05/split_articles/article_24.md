“Yale 
University 
acknowledges 
that 
indigenous peoples and nations, includ-
ing Mohegan, Mashantucket Pequot, 
Eastern Pequot, Schaghticoke, Golden 
Hill Paugussett, Niantic, and the 
Quinnipiac and other Algonquian speak-
ing peoples, have stewarded through 
generations the lands and waterways 
of what is now the state of Connecticut. 
We honor and respect the enduring rela-
tionship that exists between these peoples 
and nations and this land.”

The first time she heard Yale’s land 
acknowledgment, Nyché Andrew 
’25, a Yup’ik and Inupiaq student from 
Alaska, felt confused. She was attend-
ing an online first-year orientation 
meeting about how Yale students could 
be respectful residents of New Haven. 
Nyché felt the statement lacked any 
sort of urgency and wondered if other 
students were even paying attention. 
As she heard the acknowledgment read 
again at various Yale events, her con-
fusion sharpened to frustration. “The 
syntax, by using ‘has stewarded,’ refuses 
to be more present about Native peo-
ples’ relation to land today,’’ she tells me. 
“By ignoring Yale’s active harm against 
Native people, [the statement] goes 
into erasure.”

Yale adopted their current land 
acknowledgment in October 2019. Out 
of the three Indigenous professors and 
six Indigenous students I talked to, 
none of them knew how or why the 
statement was drafted. None of the six 
University administrators, each a part 
of the secretary office that issued the 
statement, returned my emails asking 
for more information. On the website 
of the Office of the Secretary and Vice 
President for Student Life, where the 
statement is published, there is no spe-
cific policy about where it ought to be 
recited; the website simply notes that 
the statement is “approved university 
language” that may be used at events. 
While several students and pro-
fessors I spoke with pointed to the 
importance of land acknowledgments 
as a practice, many feel that Yale’s cur-
rent statement falls short of meaning-
ful action. For Nyché, Yale’s statement 
raises more questions than it answers. 
How have these people stewarded the 
land? Do they still? And how does Yale 
“honor and respect” them, apart from 
sometimes reading their names aloud? 

II. 
I drive past the Quinnipiac River, 
past Sachem’s Head, past North 
Guilford, 
past Old 
Saybrook—all 
letters on a green sign beside the 
I-95 tarmac—and find myself at the 
Mashantucket Pequot Museum and 
Research Center. 

Each of these names means some-
thing else to Connor Smith.
Smith’s wife and stepchildren 
are Mashantucket Pequot, and he 
spends his days as an educator work-
ing under the huge pine and oak trees 
of the Mashantucket Pequot Museum. 
Raised in Branford and New Haven, 
Smith grew up on soil cared for by the 
Quinnipiac. I knew the Quinnipiac 
people lived in Southern Connecticut 
before British colonists arrived in New 
Haven—Yale’s current land acknowl-
edgment states as much. But Smith 
tells me that “much of what people
