Frizz. Everywhere. It’s the first 
thing I notice—or rather, feel—when 
I push open the slightly-jammed door to 
J&L Orchids. My hair balloons around 
my head. Such is the reality of life in a 
high-humidity greenhouse, the prime 
environment for the cultivation of the 
tropical forest-native orchidaceae family: 
the orchid flower.


Located in Easton, J&L Orchids 
is Connecticut’s only registered orchid 
nursery, according to owner Lucas 
Carreno. As I enter the shop, Carreno 
greets me with a wave.


Wandering through the shop with 
Carreno, it’s hard to believe I’m still in 
Connecticut. Floral presentations festoon 
the shop: flowers dangle from the wall, 
bloom from small rocks hung on racks, 
and line long wooden shelves. Large glass 
cases in the entry room display pots for 
sale. Past the propped-open door to the 
greenhouse itself, vines, stems, and buds 
weave together in variegated colors. 
Orchids of all species and shades 
greet me with open faces. They are 
friendly. They are familiar. I take a deep 
breath in, and the intermingling fra-
grances of soil, wood, and pollen seep 
past my skin and into my memory. 


As a child, I spent many warm week-
end mornings kneeling in dewy grass with 
my dadi—my grandma—as we hunched 
over small mounds of earth. Though we 
knew the seeds would only bud maybe 
twenty percent of the time, it didn’t mat-
ter. As we toiled away in the March sun, 
digging up unhealthy stems yellowing at 
the edges, we planted new life into her 
little patch of home. The dry Dallas heat, 
we eventually realized, was not the ideal 
climate for growing a plant native to the 
tropics, but nevertheless we tried.


My dadi didn’t like to pick favor-
ites, but I always thought that, of all the 
flowers we planted, she loved orchids the 
best. “It’s like they have little faces,” she 
would tell me. “Little expressions.” 


When my dad was a child, my 
dadi made the decision for our fam-
ily to move from Pakistan to the U.S. 
Back in Pakistan, she loved the ritual 
of gardening; as a physician, her pas-
sion for tending to life extended past 
the human body and to the open earth. 
But the roots she found here didn’t lie in 
the terrestrial soil. Instead, they spread 
through the contours and crevices of her 
new home: the Al Markaz restaurant 
on LBJ Freeway; the knitting section of 
Michael’s on Midway; the “international 
spice” rack at Kroger. 


“Orchids,” Carreno tells me, “are 
diasporic plants.” They are the sec-
ond-largest family of flowering species 
in the world. While fragile, Carreno 
adds, orchids are self-sufficient and 
hardy, deriving energy and water from 
their own roots and environment, 
requiring little outside interference.


Carreno’s roots are in physics, not 
flowers. I ask him how his CalTech 
degree brought him to this tiny 
greenhouse in the middle of semi-ru-
ral Connecticut. 


He chuckles. “Family.”


While the shop was originally 
opened in the late nineteen-sixties by 
two chemists passionate about orchid 
cultivation, Carreno’s family bought J&L 
in 2017, searching for a change from their 
urban lifestyle in Washington, D.C.


J&L, Carreno explains, is a pioneer 
in the realm of not only orchid cultiva-
tion, but also hybridization. Within the 
greenhouse, the shop’s employees breed 
orchids to maximize presentability, color, 
and bud development. They intention-
ally pollinate certain seeds with pre-
dicted visual appeal before incubating 
them in small containers, such as straw-
berry tubs, to increase humidity and 
protect them from the cold.

“It’s 
select 
breeding,” 
Carreno 
explains. “Horticulturally, it’s some-
what like line breeding, where you take 
a family line and just continue that line.” 


I left J&L with a new orchid of 
my own. It now sits on my nightstand. 
It’s beginning to bloom; its white face, 
speckled with violet, expands slowly 
towards my bed. 


“Orchids are a great starter plant,” 
Carreno reassures me. “They don’t require 
much care, but they brighten the home.” 


I look at my new orchid. It’s smil-
ing up at me. ∎
