¡Buenas tardes, New Haven!
n Wilbur Cross High School’s 
vast auditorium, the salsa music halts. 
New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker steps 
up to the podium to share a few words. 
The family next to me exchange impa-
tient whispers—clearly, he is not who 
they are here to see.

As the first pair of young women 
strut onto the stage, heralded by Daddy 
Yankee’s “BONITA,” the woman next 
to me shrieks and stands up to record. 
“Sorry,” she whispers sheepishly, as the 
duo takes their positions and poses at 
either end. Far upstage, a large banner 
features images of güiros, cuatros, and 
tambores in front of the Puerto Rican 
flag. The instruments coalesce around an 
insignia: PRU Presents Miss Puerto Rico of 
Greater New Haven 2024. 

The annual pageant, which traces its 
history in New Haven back to the nine-
teen-seventies, seeks to select a Miss and 
Junior Miss Puerto Rico to serve as role 
models for the city’s Puerto Rican youth 
and award them a scholarship prize. A 
dozen girls aged twelve to eighteen 
will each represent one of Puerto Rico’s 
seventy-eight municipalities, with their 
chosen pueblos corresponding to their 
parents’ or grandparents’ hometowns on 
the island. As they dance their opening 
salsa in a swirl of red and blue leotards, 
I notice their sashes: Miss Cayey. Miss 
Peñuelas. Miss San Juan. The atmosphere 
awakens a deep nostalgia in me—the 
music that colored my childhood on the 
island, the ritual of religiously watching 
the Miss Universe Puerto Rico broadcast 
with my family every year.

Here, over a thousand miles away 
from the island, these New Haven girls 
forge a Puerto Rican identity that is 
meaningful and true to them.

“We’re not just building our next 
reinas,” stresses Joe Rodríguez, president 
of Puerto Ricans United, the organiza-
tion that has run the pageant for the past 
two years. “We’re building our next cul-
tural ambassadors.”

T
he Monday before 
the 
pag-
eant, I sit in a crowded Lorenzo’s 
Ristorante Italiano, enjoying a pre-pag-
eant dinner alongside contestants and 
their families. 17-year-old Alanna tells 
me about her first time visiting Cayey, 
Puerto Rico this past summer. She 
recalls strolling through the central 
plaza’s colonial Spanish buildings, lis-
tening to her great-grandmother’s sto-
ries. She traced the steps of her family’s 
history across the city, as though she 
were following a ghost. 

Like the streams Cayey is known 
for, Alanna’s voice is bubbly and clear. 
Last year, she was the pageant’s first 
runner-up—the First Princess. She lets 
this motivate her. “I did this last year, 
and I almost won, which means I’m 
definitely going to win this year,” she 
says, smiling.

Though its current iteration is only 
in its second year, the history of New 
Haven’s Miss Puerto Rico pageant 
stretches back much longer. 

Waves of migation formed Puerto 
Rican communities across the state 
starting 
in 
nineteen-fifties—a 
decade marked on the island by eco-
nomic uncertainty and federal crack-
downs on nationalism and cultural
