There was a time when I knew everything. 
I knew the migration patterns of sperm whales, why we carve into the skin of beech 
trees, and how to write sentences that crescendo. I knew I loved Spring. I knew when the 
cherry blossoms stuck to the sidewalks and the dirt of my mom’s herb garden stunk of 
mildew, carts of Italian ice would come to the street corners and days would stretch and 
glimmer like the spider web across my bedroom window. 
The world fell into place at my fingertips. And I, with the ferocious determination of 
a 6-year-old, could tug at it, weave it, mold it till my palms were caked with its clay. 
Is it possible to know nothing?
These days, I wander. I run circles around this new city, stopping at every tree to revel 
in the shock of its blossoms. I trip over words. I can’t remember why I ever wanted to 
write, or study trees, can’t recall where I am from, or why I’m here now, hurdling through 
hot Spring days.
In this new April sun, my hands are fat and pink.
