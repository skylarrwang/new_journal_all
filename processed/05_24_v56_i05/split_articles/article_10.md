Points of Departure
Front Runners
From East Rock to the Olympic Marathon 
Trials, all roads lead to the New Haven 
Road Runners
I
n early February, Kidan Kidane 
YSN ’24 stood behind the line at 
the 2024 Women’s U.S. Olympic 
Marathon Trials in Orlando, Florida. 
She steeled herself for the 26.2 miles 
ahead, while New Haven runners 
gathered around their TVs to watch 
her on the race livestream. 

Two years earlier, before moving to 
New Haven, Kidane thought she had 
given up competitive running. Born 
in Ethiopia and raised in the state 
of Georgia, Kidane had been run-
ning since high school. She received a 
track scholarship to Kennesaw State 
University to run the 5K and 10K, but 
she stopped running after graduation to 
pursue nursing. When she came to Yale 
for her master’s degree, Kidane discov-
ered a robust running community that 
reignited her interest in the sport—this 
time at much longer distances. 

Remarkably, Kidane was one of four 
runners from New Haven who com-
peted in the Olympic trials. Just ten 
minutes before she lined up, Connor 
Rockett YSE ’24, Ben Decker SOM ’23, 
and John McGowan ’13 had begun run-
ning at the Men’s trials. 

The Olympic Marathon Trials, one 
of the most prestigious competitions 
for runners, only occurs once every four 
years. The qualifying times––2:18 for 
men and 2:37 for women––are nearly a 
full hour faster than those of the Boston 
Marathon. Even so, New Haven run-
ners have a surprisingly large presence 
in this exclusive race. 

While New Haven locals form 
the base of the city’s running commu-
nity, many runners are Yale affiliates, 
meaning the running community is 
highly transient. One might expect 
that such high turnover rates make it 
difficult for runners to create a last-
ing community beyond the confines 
of Yale. However, the city’s running 
community shatters this assumption, 
producing lifelong friendships and 
national accomplishments. 

As Kidane recounted her run-
ning journey to me over a phone call a 
month after the trials, I could hear the 
hunger for the sport in her voice. “I go 
out hard and race aggressively,” she told 
me, confidence underscoring her words. 
“An experienced runner told me they 
didn’t think I could do it, so I thought 
to myself, ‘Watch me.’” She ran the 
Boston Marathon in 2:36:22, qualifying 
for the trials with thirty-eight seconds 
to spare—even after stopping to puke 
(“twice,” she added). 

Kidane and her fellow Olympic 
trial qualifiers—Rockett, Decker, and 
McGowan—train with New Haven 
Road Runners (NHRR), the primary run 
club in New Haven. The group offers 
daily 6:30 a.m. runs and social night 
runs on Wednesdays open to anyone. 
Unlike most run clubs, the routes are 
designed by their coach, Jake Jayworth. 
Also the professional coach for the 
Fairfield University cross country team, 
Jayworth has a USA Track and Field 
Level 1 coaching certification and a 
master’s degree in Exercise Science. He 
works individually with runners and 
designs daily routes for NHRR. 

Since reinstating daily runs at the 
end of 2020, the club has amassed over 
three hundred members and beaten 
almost every previous club record. The 
Wednesday night social runs have 
become particularly popular, with nearly 
forty runners showing up for the con-
versational jog and post-run hangout at 
The Trinity Bar. Other seasoned NHRR 
runners have joined each other in run-
ning ultramarathons under the influence 
of psilocybin, also known as shrooms. 

NHHR has also been a space for reflec-
tion. In 2023, NHRR runner Miche Palmer 
YSE ’17 founded a book club for the 
group. Popular titles include “Choosing 
to Run” by Des Linden and “Good for 
a Girl” by Lauren Fleshman, prompting 
discussion about the systemic inequalities 
in running, like the lack of recognition 
for female athletes. “[New Haven] is not 
like New York where there’s a bunch of 
different run clubs. NHRR is trying to fig-
ure out how to be a club for a lot of dif-
ferent people,” explained Jayworth.

I ran my first marathon last year. 
After tumbling over the finish line, I 
told myself it would be my last. Much 
like Kidane, I fell out of competitive 
running before moving to New Haven. 
Kidane had graduated from college and 
was on her own working in Atlanta 
when she stopped racing, and I was in a 
small town with an even smaller popu-
lation of runners. However, New Haven 
provided me with a community that 
reinvigorated my love for running. On 
one particularly rainy day, as I trudged 
through the mud in East Rock and rued 
my decision to run, I passed another 
runner. He cheered at our shared ded-
ication, and I couldn’t help but  laugh at 
the absurdity of the situation and enjoy 
it for what it was. 

Though Yale Club Running fore-
grounds my running community here, 
my occasional interactions with NHRR 
have helped me reflect on my relation-
ship with the sport. Even when I’m run-
ning alone, passing NHRR runners on the 
track or on local routes encourages me 
to keep going. On Strava, a social media 
app where runners connect online to 
share their runs, I’ve found an online 
community with members of NHRR like 
Kidane. Since the start of my collegiate 
career this past fall, I’ve run too many 
5Ks and two marathons—despite having 
“retired” last year. 

Earlier this month, as I stood at 
the start line of my most recent mar-
athon, the excitement from the past 
few months of running in New Haven 
surged through me. My confidence was 
high knowing that the friends I’d spent 
tens of hours running with were all 
around me, gearing up for the same race. 
That day, I set my own personal record 
and set my sights on the next race.  ∎
