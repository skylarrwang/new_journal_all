n this town, letters are scarce: 
billboards, neon signs. I only realize 
how thirsty I am when Ba asks me to 
clean out my grandfather’s cupboards 
of books. Take anything she says. 
An-y-thing. As I thumb through the 
words of a life, makeshift bookmarks 
fall from the pages. Quotidian things: 
unused tissues, grocery receipts, old 
photographs. I don’t tell Ba that her 
young photograph swims between 
the lines of an old poetry anthology. 
Instead, I kiss the individual receipts 
and bookstore invoices, making care-
ful note that in 1999, my grandfather 
left the HEB with a tub of butter pecan 
and some gardening tools to bring 
home for his wife. 

I spend time admiring the curve of 
Ba’s soft skull. She has a proud fore-
head, behind which she gathers wisps 
of hair into a knob of a ponytail. To 
the knob, she attaches a fake chignon 
of plastic hair. When she naps, her 
small head engulfed by the rectangular 
whiteness of the pillow, she leaves the 
hairpiece nearby as though it keeps 
her company. As she sleeps, I notice 
her tattooed eyebrows, ones which 
never wash off, ones which make her 
endlessly discerning.

I only have words as my aid to 
describe to you this scene. What’s real, 
and there’s not much of it, is overgrown 
and dilapidated. The largest abun-
dance of color comes from the junk-
yard, where husks of cars and scraps of 
metal bloom different hues of rust on a 
thick carpet of tall grasses. The rest of 
it, the parking lots and big-box chains, 
arrived from elsewhere, I’m not sure 
where exactly, and perhaps all at once. 
Today I drove the rental car to the 
town center only to discover that it’s an 
outdoor mall. I try making my way back 
on the six-lane highway, but bearded men 
in pickup trucks honk and cuss me out 
through the driver’s side window. SUVs 
as big as spaceships float by me without 
pity. In their cabins, climate-controlled 
and behind tinted panes of glass, subur-
ban children gaze at the milieu of strip 
malls they must know only as landscape. 
There is not a tree in sight. 

Even the air feels flat. Even the sky, 
just one giant blue plane, is flat. Only 
my Ba’s head is round. As we drive, she 
notes her favorite grocery store, point-
ing with her chin the way flowers do 
towards their sun. ∎
