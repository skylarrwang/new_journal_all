bread—flavors that could only be brewed 
under the chokehold of late eighties 
communism. Bourdain said the Czech 
Republic had “obviously a long way to go 
to catch up with” the culinary prowess of 
its European neighbors. I didn’t care that 
the food was usually briny in taste and 
beige in color—I wanted to tell Alex all 
about it. Only he would understand the 
geopolitical significance of pickled meat. 
I saw him everywhere in Prague: in 
cold slabs of meat (Alex was in charge of 
the charcuterie station at work), in the 
portrait of Gorbachev that was chiefly 
displayed at the end of the Museum of 
Communism (Alex owned a shot glass 
adorned with a picture of the perestroika 
prince), in a gorgeous Belarusian model 
named Alex who approached me outside 
a grisly biker bar (Alex’s name was Alex). 
I had to do something else. I took a 
FlixBus during the penultimate week-
end of my program. I spent nine hours 
searching for bratwurst in Berlin. 

There were beer gardens, flea mar-
kets, the Berlin Wall, and not a single 
bratwurst in the supposed mecca of 
with 2020 tour dates from my favorite 
band, PUP—the exact same poster that 
hung on my bedroom wall, that I bought 
at their concert in Phoenix. He had been 
there, too. (Did we not hear each other’s 
voices over the rupture of sludgy bass lines 
and grating guitars? Was there a time 
when we were both in the Target parking 
lot, contained by the respective cars of our 
single parents? Were our Arizonan brains 
ever beside each other in a pizzeria in 
Connecticut, befuddled by clam as a top-
ping? How had we not seen each other so 
many times before—how were we lucky 
enough to find each other now?)
We met, ceremoniously. Without 
reuniting, we soon left for our respective 
study abroad programs. I went to Prague, 
where I was sickened by the thought 
of him drinking tequila and dancing 
with other girls in Oaxaca. We texted 
once since we both left Arizona, when I 
pathetically said Alejandro how is Mexico 
followed by This is Chesed btw idk if this 
sent from my czech number haha. My weak 
stomach was worsened by pork knuck-
les, cheap beer, pickled sausage, sour 
bratwurst. At 11 p.m. I resigned to eating 
from a storefront plastered in a beachy 
sunset wallpaper—Sudanese street food. 
I ordered something with the German 
word for chicken in its description. It was 
a pita pocket with chili oil. It burned the 
absolute shit out of my throat. 

I had never loved a food that hurt me 
so much. 

For once, I ate something so won-
derfully antagonistic I didn’t even think 
about telling Alex. It was just me, Berlin, 
and the chili oil battering my sinuses. 
I never saw Alex again. Maybe I 
could think of him like my pita pocket—
maybe I would end up at an international 
street food fair someday, and maybe I 
would crash into my pita pocket like an 
old friend, but I warmed to the likelihood 
that I would not, that I only had that 
night on the street with tears in my eyes 
and burnt lips. There are a billion meals I 
will love. There are a billion line cooks left 
to make them. ∎
