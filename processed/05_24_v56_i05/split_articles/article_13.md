symbols. In 1964, Connecticut held its 
first official Puerto Rican Day Parade 
in Hartford, to celebrate a diasporic 
culture at a time when it was manifestly 
under attack.

By the nineteen-seventies, local 
Miss Puerto Rico pageants took place 
in New Haven, Bridgeport, Waterbury, 
and more. The winners of each city’s 
pageant then competed for the state 
title, and for the honor of donning the 
crown and sash on their royal float at 
that year’s statewide parade. 
But New Haven’s last pageant took 
place in 2008. And the last parade and 
festival on the New Haven Green took 
place just a year later. Magaly Cajigas, 
the former Miss Puerto Rico of New 
Haven 1992, explained to me that the 
volunteer-run statewide pageant had 
proven difficult to organize and fund. 
Many volunteers broke away to focus 
on their own city-level cultural pro-
grams. In New Haven, eventually, sev-
eral community elders stepped down 
from their boards without leaving clear 
successors. 
Almost a decade of dreadful silence 
elapsed before Puerto Ricans United 
was able to bring bomba and plena 
back to the New Haven Green in 2016. 
In 2022, Rodríguez approached Anika 
Russell and Samary Polnett, both 
mothers and former Miss Puerto Rico 
of New Haven contestants, to gauge 
their interest in reviving the pageant 
for the following year. Eagerly, Russell 
and Polnett signed on as co-directors.
Russell tells me she credits the 
pageant with inspiring her back in 
high school. “I was going to school 
out of district, and there weren’t 
many Puerto Ricans at my school,” 
she recalls. “I was very shy, I was very 
reserved, and I felt like this pageant, 
as a teenager, instilled some self-con-
fidence, some leadership skills. It got 
me involved in my community.” 
Now, she hopes to bring that expe-
rience to a new generation of girls. For 
these girls, scattered across the Greater 
New Haven area, most have had little 
contact with Puerto Ricans beyond 
their family circles—which may them-
selves be multiethnic or generations 
removed from the island.

A
t the Miss Puerto Rico of Greater 
New Haven pageant, each act is 
judged on “cultural relevance” along-
side creativity and overall presentation. 
From the pageant’s talent component, 
I recognize “Preciosa” rendered on sax-
ophone, and “La Borinqueña” drawn 
across cello strings. I’m thrilled to 
see Miss Cabo Rojo Johanelyz dance 
a bomba, a traditional Puerto Rican 
dance; like the petals of a hibiscus 
flower ruffled by the breeze, her layered 
skirt blooms and withers around her 
body as she spins.
For Alanna’s act, she performs 
“Carnaval del Barrio” from Lin-Manuel 
Miranda’s musical “In the Heights,” her 
alto reverberating through the audi-
torium. Though her mother was born 
in Cayey, Alanna’s father is Black and 
from Connecticut. As an Afro-Boricua, 
she understands that this pageant, on 
its face, asks her to embody just half of 
her identity. 
“Based on whoever is looking at me, 
they either think I’m Black or Puerto 
Rican; I’m somewhere in between. I 
like to tell myself that my ancestors on 
both sides were both taken from Africa, 
just, the ships landed in different areas,” 
Alanna says. “When people think of 
Puerto Ricans, they don’t think of 
someone that looks like me. They think 
of a specific, stereotypical Boricua, typ-
ical Latina; with the dark hair, the pale 
skin, and the brown eyes.”
The presence of this idealized 
Puerto Rican Woman seems to loom 
over all the girls. She is fuzzy—a phan-
tom—but easily distinguishable by her 
fluent Spanish, sun-kissed complexion, 
and inborn ability to dance. She rep-
resents a woman who is unquestionably 
Puerto Rican—to whom Puerto Rican-
ness offers no resistance.
I do not know what it’s like to have 
this Puerto Rican Woman peering over 
my shoulder. I’ve spent my entire life 
on the island, and I have always, more 
or less, taken my Puerto Rican-ness 
for granted. It’s never something to 
be questioned or proven. However, for 
girls growing up in New Haven who 
may not know that such a woman does 
not even exist on the island, this beau-
tiful phantom can be harder to dispel.
In the three months prior to the 
April pageant, volunteers dedicate 
themselves to helping the girls pre-
pare. They practice modeling, etiquette, 
even financial literacy. On Tuesdays, 
at Viva! Dance Center in West Haven, 
the girls learn salsa, bomba, plena, and 
other Puerto Rican dances from a for-
mer pageant queen. On Thursdays, they 
trade their dance shoes for notebooks, 
studying the history of Puerto Rico 
and their family’s pueblos.
13-year-old 
Lysella, 
the 
reign-
ing Junior Miss Puerto Rico of 
Connecticut 2023 who is representing 
San Juan in the pageant’s Junior Miss 
category, recalls being bogged down by 
pageant homework. But the work paid 
off, she tells me, beaming in a ruffled 
orange-red jumpsuit. Lysella has only 
ever visited San Juan—the city both 
her mother and I grew up in—once, 
and remembers little apart from the 
strikingly blue sixteenth-century cob-
blestones lining the Old City’s streets. 
Still, she has learned much more about 
her pueblo and Puerto Rico’s history. 
Insistently, she talked to me about la 
Ley de la Mordaza, the law that made 
it a crime to display the Puerto Rican 
flag during the nineteen-forties and 
nineteen-fifties, and the billions of dol-
lars in withheld federal aid to the island 
after 2017’s Hurricane María.
The pageant this year features a 
cultural costume component. Each 
dress transports the audience to one 
of the girls’ Puerto Rican pueblos: a 
ribbon-adorned fairy dress alludes to 
a famous Peñuelas legend; a shimmer-
ing leotard and lion mask pays homage 
to the carnivals of Ponce; a bedazzled 
boxer’s garb recalls that worn by Cabo 
Rojo’s Mayra Matos during her run 
as Miss Universe Puerto Rico 2009. 
Before the audience’s eyes, the white 
train on Lysella’s red dress morphs into 
a giant seashell that frames her, Venus-
like, as she spins around to reveal the 
design of San Juan’s crest on its back.
When Alanna steps on stage in a 
floor-length light blue dress, I notice 
the tiny model skeletons peeking out 
from between the folds of her tulle 
skirt. “Under Iglesia Nuestra Señora 
de la Asunción, there’s three hun-
dred to five hundred human remains,” 
Alanna had told me. In the auditorium, 
she turns around to reveal the face of 
the church, rendered in white and blue 
brushstrokes, before lifting her hands 
to the sky. They are bound in gold 
chains. An ode, I realize, to one of the 
deceased—a little Taíno girl, whose 
skull bears the green imprint of oxi-
dized chains.

M
iriam, the 2023 Miss Puerto Rico 
of Greater New Haven, glitters, her 
eyelids dusted with gold and her head 
crowned with gems. Reflecting on the 
end of her reign, she’s nostalgic.
“There’s no better love than the love 
Boricuas can give you,” she tells me. 
Presenting herself as Miss Puerto Rico 
at cultural parades and festivals in New 
Haven and New York City showed her 
the vibrance of the wider Puerto Rican 
community, helping her to overcome 
her doubts about her ability to repre-
sent them. 
“I was like, if I could speak Spanish, 
I know that I could really represent 
Puerto Ricans one hundred percent,” 
she recalled. “But then, that’s when I 
took that step back and I realized that, 
no, you can represent Puerto Ricans in 
so many other ways.” During her reign 
as Miss Puerto Rico, Miriam spoke at 
schools across the city, campaigned for 
autism awareness, and earned a spot on 
Connecticut’s Afro-Latino 30 Under 30.
Miriam fondly recalls spending the 
summers with her family in Caguas, 
Puerto Rico. She insists I should visit 
Plaza Palmer and stop by their giant 
birdcage—which, though I drive through
