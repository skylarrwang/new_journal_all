Waiting for Welcome
handle it and hadn’t expected the difficulty, pain, 
and potential danger that could arise from this kind 
of volunteer work. Both the man and woman had 
come to her for help.
“It’s hard, when you don’t know how to help 
people,” Silk said. She remembered how her daugh-
ter, a social worker, raised this concern too: “‘Mom, 
you’re not trained. You can’t solve this problem.’”
The refugee woman eventually obtained a 
restraining order, and is now safely raising her chil-
dren. But it was after helping this family that Silk 
noticed the emotional toll this work could take on 
her. She’s since stepped back from directly working 
with refugees, now focusing more heavily on JCARR’s 
administrative affairs and organizing its volunteers. 
Silk has faith in the expansion of refugee resettle-
ment, but perhaps not for the everyday volunteer—
at least, not without sufficient support. “I would love 
to be wrong,” she said of the Welcome Corps, “but I 
believe that they’re probably naive.” 


How Much Is Enough?
W
elcome corps Groups only have to be 
accountable as sponsors for ninety days—the 
Department of State’s minimum for all resettlement 
agencies. According to the Center for Migration 
Studies, this timeline isn’t enough to assist many 
families as they integrate into what is often an 
incredibly different way of living and with little to 
their name. In Connecticut, established resettlement 
agencies and longtime community co-sponsors have 
also expressed concern over the ninety day require-
ment, and whether these voluntary groups are pre-
pared for the realities of this commitment. 
“So far, the people that have shown interest in the 
program have the means financially, but not the knowl-
edge of how to access the services needed during the 
ninety-day period of resettlement,” Marenid Carattini, 
CIRI’s Director of Refugee Services, told me. 
Most agencies provide their services for much 
longer: IRIS community co-sponsors must commit 
to assisting families for at least one year (JCARR 
helps for two to three), and CIRI has a five-year 
resettlement assistance program. Hartford Catholic 
Charities stopped accepting new refugee cases in 
2019 but was still contractually obligated to help 
families for five years. Meanwhile, Carattini also 
noted that the extra time is crucial in handling long-
term struggles, both predictable and unpredictable, 
like sudden employment, a loss of benefits, or assis-
tance with the naturalization process. 
The Welcome Corps must walk a delicate 
line: ensure its program is accessible enough 
that it can fulfill its promise of democratiz-
ing resettlement, but keep the requirements 
rigorous enough to ensure that sponsors are 
equipped to properly resettle families. In the 
process, however, this creates a barrier for a 
newer demographic of sponsors from diasporic 
communities—often the ones with the most at 
stake to become a sponsor. 
In Yazan’s group, he took on the role of 
Coordinator, a designated member responsible for 
submitting the application and being the point of 
contact between Welcome Corps representatives 
and their PSG. He also took on as many sponsorship 
requirements as he could by himself—even though 
most PSGs work through them collectively. “I guess 
I didn’t want to bother them,” he said, concerned 
about his uncle and aunt’s own busy lives. 
Yazan completed the application, which included 
a list of questions prompting him for information 
on where sponsorees may find accessible healthcare, 
language services, and other public benefits. Then, 
he took a free four-hour online course covering the 
“Sponsorship Essentials” of the Welcome Corps—
another requirement that only Coordinators are 
obligated to complete. 
He then had to raise at least $9,700, a total of 
$2,425 per family member he hoped to sponsor. This 
minimum is based on the same amount that the 
Department of State currently provides to refugee 
resettlement agencies. To prevent misappropriation 
of government funds, it must be raised by spon-
sors alone. For Yazan, finding a place to put these 
funds—and prove there were enough—was the 
most difficult requirement, taking him two weeks to 
finish. He needed a bank statement from an account 
that listed the official name of his PSG. 
“I went to three different banks,” he says. “It was 
hard for me…I spent a whole week just trying to 
figure out how I’m going to show them that I’m 
financially stable.” 
Yazan finally turned to GoFundMe at another 
IRIS staffer’s advice. Then, he needed to raise at 
least 60 percent of his required funds before his 
group could be eligible for approval. After a couple 
of months of outreach at local mosques, Yazan has 
since raised $7,920—82 percent of his minimum goal. 


In the Meantime
Y
azan’s group was approved as a certified 
Naming group three months after he had met each 
sponsorship requirement. 
“Once a group gets certified as a Naming 
Group, then a referral has been made to the U.S. 
Refugee Admissions Program,” IRIS Director of 
Sponsorship Ann O’Brien told me, “[USRAP] still 
has to go and talk to the specific individual to see if 
the refugee claim can be accepted for the program. 
So we don’t know yet how long it will take for that 
process to happen.”
All that’s left is to wait. 
I asked Yazan if he knew anything about the 
timeline ahead for his sponsorship group, or when his 
family might be approved for resettlement. “They don’t 
really tell us,” he said. “[But] I’ve asked around and they 
told me anywhere between six months and two years.” 
The Welcome Corps has been around for less 
than two years, and its Naming program for about 
half that time. This jump in U.S. refugee resettlement, 
drawn from the old guard of nineteen-eighties 
co-sponsors and a New Haven agency’s statewide 
successes, is a bold one. But things are still early, still 
uncertain. Despite these uncertainties, Yazan can at 
least have some direct hand in bringing his family 
over far sooner, perhaps, than the fourteen years that 
his immigration lawyer had estimated before apply-
ing to the Welcome Corps. “It feels weird waiting,” 
he said, but he has hope. 
Yazan dreams of taking his mother to New York 
City. “She likes crowded places,” he said, “can’t go 
wrong with New York.” 
A little after our call, he will cook for Iftar 
to break his Ramadan fast. He tells me he’s not 
sure what he’ll make yet—maybe something with 
chicken. After that, perhaps some nighttime soc-
cer. He will go to school the next day, and he will 
go to work to help IRIS with its intake of furni-
ture for other refugees’ new homes. He will return 
to his own home, and so will his father. They will 
talk about their days and dial his mother, Ghaith, 
Yaman, and Joudi. He’ll talk with them, too. 
For now, impatiently, Yazan waits. ∎
