f I had stayed at Alex’s house for 
longer than three hours, I would have 
married him. He had a pierced ear and 
a pierced nose and a shitty tattoo of a 
goat on his chest. He studied geography. 
He had a passion for imported foods. 
He loved the New Orleans episode of 
“Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown” as 
ferociously as I did. He was, of course, a 
line cook. 


Line cooks and I have always been 
wildly fond of each other. Never chefs. 
Chefs aspire to lead. Line cooks aspire to 
be led, satiated by the thrill of smoking 
American Spirits on break (after ripping 
off the filters) and working at divey brew-
ery/grills called Copper Brothel Brewery 
or Culinary Dropout (real names). 


Anthony Bourdain is their god, even if 
they have no idea that he wrote books 
before hosting a TV show. Line cooks 
understand that they occupy the bottom 
of the kitchen hierarchy: a blessing in my 
eyes, because it means they lack a pseu-
do-macho attitude. They are sensitive to 
love and to finding a place of belonging, 
which they find in their kitchens and in 
their walk-in freezers, among their stock 
pots and meat cleavers, with sous-chefs 
breathing hot down their necks. The 
world tells them they’re in a dead-end job, 
but they’re proud to be there. Their mis-
guided optimism rubs off on me. 


My first line cook was Esteban. We 
were sophomores in high school. He was 
proud to sling chicken tenders in the 
fryer of a cowboy-themed restaurant, but 
wasn’t cognizant of food for its artistry or 
its cultural semiotics. He’d never eaten 
bratwurst and never heard of Oktoberfest, 
a celebration oddly important to my 
Lithuanian-Mexican family. He needed 
to be enlightened—he came over after 
school one day to lose his bratwurst vir-
ginity. We ate the brats quietly while 
avoiding eye contact. Esteban didn’t 
want mustard or sauerkraut on his, just 
ketchup. The following spring, our teen-
age romance fizzled when he refused to 
prompose to me because he had a shift 
scheduled on prom night. 


I graduated high school and went 
on a date with James, who I met on 
Tinder. James was a brief vice. “You’re 
overdressed,” was the first thing he said 
to me as I arrived for dinner. (We split 
some new-wave bruschetta with goat 
cheese and pepper jam and slobbered on 
chicken and steak skewers. He paid, but 
not without declaring “I want head.”) He 
hated his dad and high school. He loved 
“American Psycho,” but not as much as 
“Ratatouille.” He loved being a line cook 
at a nursing home. He was equal parts 
charming and alarming. I should have 
said no when he asked to drive me home, 
but his tender bravado was a siren song—
where else would I have found a shrimpy 
boy in a fuzzy purple sweater who so 
proudly told me he had a Latina fetish? I 
got in his car. I had to hear all of his hap-
hazard teenage cook monologue vomit. 


Instead of driving me home, he 
cruised aimlessly down Miracle Mile, a 
street known for its abundance of pros-
titutes, and awkwardly attempted to 
hold my hand. Eventually he stopped 
at a McDonald’s so I could pee. When 
I returned to his car from the bathroom 
he handed me an oblong black foam 
sleeve and muttered something about 
how its contents would make me “feel 
safer.” I unsheathed a machete. I kept the 
machete under my seat as he drove me 
home. Was he planning to kill me and 
then decided against it? I wasn’t sure. I 
kissed him anyway.


College was my rehab. I was sur-
rounded by men primed for Congress 
and Goldman Sachs, not Peter Luger 
Steak House. But then I turned twenty, 
returned home to Arizona for the sum-
mer, and the trifecta was complete—I 
met Alex. Alex cemented my affection 
for the unruly, the cast iron, the line cook. 
We spent (probably even less than) three 
hours together. When I stepped in from 
his porch, he told me that he’d actually 
been to New Haven before (and had the 
pizza). He dumped his laundry basket 
on the floor of his bathroom and franti-
cally pawed through the carnage for his 
Frank Pepe’s tee shirt. He tossed it to me, 
and while shoving socks and jeans back 
in the basket, warned me that it proba-
bly smelled gross and sweaty because he 
wore it to work that day—but then he 
glanced up to where, upon toss, I had 
already instinctively shoved my nose 
between the screen printed cotton folds. 
That night it was revealed that he too 
was a child of divorce, and grew up in the 
same town that hosted the Target parking 
lot my parents used as a weekend custody 
exchange spot. His bedroom was deco-
rated with ticket stubs from my favorite 
local indie movie theater, and a poster
