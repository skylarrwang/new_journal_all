Dear readers,
Newness is a slippery concept. For fifty-seven years, The New Journal has 
found novel ways to tell stories with familiar themes—justice, resilience, 
tradition, and rupture. As the new board of The New Journal, we will uphold 
this magazine’s longstanding mission: to describe a world in flux with 
human nuance.

In Volume 56, Issue 5, we find the face of America shifting across 
generational lines. Two of our writers pay homage to local migrant 
communities. Our cover story, by Kylie Volavongsa, examines the national 
application of a New Haven-based refugee resettlement model, which 
places the future of resettlement in the hands of everyday Americans. Ingrid 
Rodríguez Vila glimpses home in the Puerto Rican diaspora of New Haven, 
where local teens aspire to lead their community in a cultural pageant. 
In other pages, people defend their homes. Disgruntled neighbors organize 
into a tenants union; Yale and Connecticut’s Indigenous communities 
interrogate the University’s land acknowledgment; and a ragtag group of 
fishermen fight to preserve their waters. 

As we release this issue, the war on Gaza and campus protests across 
the country continue. The day after our first weekend of editing, student 
protestors occupied Beinecke Plaza and demanded that Yale immediately 
disclose its endowment holdings and divest from military weapons 
manufacturing. One week later, on Monday, April 22nd, Yale police arrested 
forty-eight of the protesters, including forty-four Yale students. As we watch 
students gather at the plaza, in the streets, and on Cross Campus, we are 
reminded that putting words to the present is an increasingly important and 
fraught task.

In the year to come, we will remain committed to this task, writing stories 
that document history and generate change. We tuck this issue into The 
New Journal archive, and release it out to you–these stories, as Samantha Liu 
writes, may now “ripple into either memory or possibility.” 

For now,
Maggie, Chloe, Aanika, Sam
