EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Several departments of Yale have 
created their own land acknowledg-
ments or have begun their own relation-
ships with Indigenous communities. The 
School of Architecture presents a map 
of Indigenous nations and recognizes 
Yale’s harm, albeit passively and in the 
past, by noting that Yale has “benefit-
ted from lands gained through fulfilled 
and unfulfilled articles of agreement 
with Indigenous nations,” and commits 
to “imagine endless possibilities for 
architectures of reconciliation, reciproc-
ity and transformation.” Northup told 
me that the students from the School 
of the Environment have visited the 
Mashantucket Pequot Museum, seeking 
to learn about Indigenous relationships 
with natural resources. To Northup and 
Andrews, these are the kinds of actions 
that a good land acknowledgment 
should spark.


Last year, Nyché, along with oth-
ers in the NACC, wrote a new land 
acknowledgment. The first paragraph of 
the statement reads as follows: 
Yale University is located on the 
lands of the Mohegan, Mashantucket 
Pequot, Eastern Pequot, Schaghticoke, 
Golden Hill Paugussett, Niantic, and the 
Quinnipiac and other Algonquian peoples 
and nations, who steward the lands and 
waterways through generations and time 
immemorial. We acknowledge the strenu-
ous history of land dispossession that Yale 
benefits from and the enduring relation-
ship between these peoples, nations, and 
land from this history. We call upon all 
to be aware of the Indigenous peoples, 
cultures, and histories of the land you 
occupy by learning about the efforts of 
Indigenous people to reclaim sovereignty 
and stewardship of their lands and com-
munities. These original stewards are the 
past, present and future caretakers of the 
land and we want to honor them.


The statement asks for a new insti-
tutional and personal tradition. These 
words float around in the communities 
closest to the NACC, but Yale adminis-
tration has yet to acknowledge it. ∎
