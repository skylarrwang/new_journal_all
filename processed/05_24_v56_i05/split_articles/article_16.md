Through a soccer-ball-sized hole 
in Alex Kolokotronis’s bathroom 
floor, light shines up from the apartment 
below. The walls and ceiling are stripped 
to the studs. A layer of fine drywall dust 
coats every surface of the apartment. On 
an overstuffed living room bookshelf, 
“Every Tenant’s Legal Guide” rests atop 
Kropotkin’s “Direct Struggle Against 
Capital” and Godwin’s “An Enquiry 
Concerning Political Justice.” 

Two months ago, a pipe burst in 
Emerson Apartments, sending water 
streaming through Kolokotronis’s light 
fixture, into his bathroom, and through the 
floor into the apartment below. The flood-
ing forced Kolokotronis GRD ’23, who has 
lived in the building for seven years, and 
two other residents out of their units until 
repairs are finished. Without demolition 
permits, the landlord, Trinity Lutheran 
Church, located next door, partially gutted 
the unit to remove mold and water dam-
age: the bathroom is currently stripped to 
the framing, and the downstairs unit is vis-
ible through the floor. No work has been 
done on the apartment, Kolokotronis says, 
since the original demolition—and lack 
of proper permitting—led to a Stop Work 
order in early March. 

After the pipe burst, property man-
ager Raymond Sola texted Kolokotronis’s 
downstairs neighbor James Blau. Blau has 
lived in Emerson for twelve years with 
his cat and his 17-year-old son, of whom 
he has half custody; since February 1st, 
Blau has been unable to live with his son. 
“Rent payments continue,” Sola wrote in 
the text, “as this is not a scheduled work 
[sic].” But Kolokotronis, who completed 
a doctoral degree at Yale focused on labor 
organizing and participated in a 2017 hun-
ger strike in support of labor union Local 
33, knew this was illegal. He contacted the 
New Haven Fair Rent Commission—the 
municipal board that processes and inves-
tigates tenant complaints regarding unfair 
rent practices—which affirmed his right to 
cease rent payments while displaced. Still, 
fed up with inconsistent communication 
from the landlord, he roused his neighbors 
to form the Emerson Tenants Union. 

Over the last few years, landlords and 
city officials in New Haven have learned 
that there is a limit to what renters will tol-
erate. Between 2019 and 2023, rent in the 
city went up by an estimated 33 percent, 
far outpacing wage increases. By 2023, 52 
percent of renters in New Haven were 
cost-burdened, meaning they spent more 
than 30 percent of their income on rent. 

In the face of climbing rents and 
increasingly dangerous and illegal living 
conditions, New Haven tenants have 
arrived at their own solution: unioniza-
tion. Emerson Tenants Union is among 
five tenant unions to emerge in the city 
since the 2022 formation of the Blake 
Street Tenants Union. The Emerson 
union is the only union of the five that 
has formed in a property not owned by 
mega-landlord 
Ocean 
Management. 

Unionization beyond corporate landlords, 
which have been accused of slumlord 
practices, reflects tenants’ deeper needs 
for recognition and recourse.

Though this groundswell of tenant 
unionization seems to have momentum, 
the city’s bureaucracy has been unable to 
keep up. City agencies, like the Fair Rent 
Commission and the Liveable Cityies 
Initiative, are designed to process individ-
ual complaints and cannot handle cases 
brought collectively by tenant unions. A 
local ordinance passed two years ago bars 
landlords from retaliating against orga-
nizers over unionization, but there is no 
local, state, or federal requirement for 
property owners to bargain with a tenants
