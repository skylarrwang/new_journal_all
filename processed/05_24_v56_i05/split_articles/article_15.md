Caguas frequently, I had never noticed. I 
ask her if she ever felt at home there. “It’s 
complicated,” she laughs. “Being there, I 
feel like it’s a part of where I’m supposed 
to be. But where I belong is in [New 
Haven], my city. That’s how I feel.” 

Miriam is not the Puerto Rican 
Woman, that ethereal, fuzzy-edged fig-
ment. She is a true representative of her 
community, a young woman who embod-
ies the particular struggles and strengths of 
New Haven’s Puerto Rican youth.

The point of the pageant is not to 
replicate an “authentic” Puerto Rican 
cultural experience—one that is indis-
tinguishable from what exists on the 
island. Alanna, Lysella, and Miriam 
have grown up navigating cityscapes 
and braving Northeastern winters, not 
fanning themselves during heat waves 
and trying to sleep through coquí 
symphonies. The pageant is just as 
much about building a distinct New 
Haven Puerto Rican community as 
it is about connecting the girls to the 
roots common to Puerto Ricans all 
over the world. 

Lysella takes pride in her newfound 
community. “I felt disconnected from 
my own people. Now I feel more con-
nected, ‘cause…look who I’m around.” 

Alanna describes Puerto Ricans 
United as a “large family,” and her 
fellow contestants as “sisters.” She 
loves how different they all are, and 
how fiercely they support one another. 
“Even on the day of the pageant, right 
before you go on stage everyone is like, 
‘Good luck, you got this!’”

In her sequined pink dress, Alanna 
walks gracefully. For someone who 
insisted that the evening gown was her 
least favorite part of the pageant, she’s 
doing a great job of hiding it. Her smile 
does not falter as she draws her final 
question from the box: “Why do you 
deserve this title?”

“I deserve this title because I’ve grown 
a lot in the past year. I’m not the same girl 
who was crowned First Princess last year, 
and I’ve learned through my mistakes 
and my failures to become a more poised, 
but also intellectual Miss Puerto Rico. As 
Miss Puerto Rico, I will—I intend to—
create a different image of Puerto Rican 
women. That we don’t have to be fiery 
and extra, that we can be passionate, and 
we can be precise, and we can be intellec-
tual. We can be smart, and we can pursue 
studies.” The crowd erupts into a deafen-
ing rumble. 

“I want to be a role model for young 
women,” Alanna finishes.

At the time, Alanna did not know 
whether she would win the title. She 
still cannot believe she can. “It’ll sink 
in later tonight,” she admits breath-
lessly. The massive crown atop her head 
has remained since it was placed there 
by Miriam. Lysella beams not too far 
behind, the Junior Miss Puerto Rico 
sash glittering against her red gown.

I don’t know exactly how the new 
Miss and Junior Miss Puerto Rico feel 
at this moment. But as I watch a color-
ful swarm of friends and family storm 
the stage, I can’t help but believe that, 
at the very least, we’re speaking the 
same language. ∎
