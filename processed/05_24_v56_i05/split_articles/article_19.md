Waiting for Welcome
Yazan (far left) and his siblings as children
mostly white, faith-based service organizations. 

Conventionally, these agencies sponsored fami-
lies approved by the UNHCR and referred to the 
USRAP; however, these groups had little say in 
who they sponsored. When the Welcome Corps 
first launched, it paired refugees and sponsor 
groups the same way. Nearly a year later, in 
December 2023, the Welcome Corps opened a 
means of sponsorship never before seen in the 
U.S. It allowed sponsors to identify specific ref-
ugees they wanted to resettle, so long as they 
have already been registered as a refugee or asy-
lum seeker by the UNHCR or the government of 
the country they’re currently located in. 

Through the Welcome Corps, Yazan and 
his family may finally have the chance to be 
together soon, and for good. 

Setting Up Sponsorship
T
he Biden administration Describes the 
Welcome Corps as an effort to expand the U.S.’ 
capacity to resettle refugee families and mod-
ernize current refugee resettlement programs. It 
launched the Welcome Corps amid a series of 
international crises, including the fall of Kabul 
in 2021 and the escalation of conflict between 
Ukraine and Russia in 2022. The program is also 
a response to historically low refugee admissions 
ceilings during Donald Trump’s presidency, which 
saw an 86 percent drop in U.S. refugee admissions 
over the course of his term. 

To expand and update the U.S.’ refugee 
resettlement capacity, the Biden administra-
tion turned to a resettlement model known as 
community co-sponsorship, where an official 
agency approves and trains community orga-
nizations to sponsor refugees on its behalf. 

Though an iteration of this model was pio-
neered in Canada, the administration looked 
to New Haven—where the nation’s leading 
example of the co-sponsorship model grew 
from the offices of IRIS, a nonprofit nestled in 
New Haven’s East Rock neighborhood.
 “For many, many years, there was an assump-
tion that [refugee resettlement] is a really spe-
cialized technical work that requires a lot of 
experienced case managers and it cannot be done 
by a ragtag group of volunteers,” Chris George, 
former Executive Director of IRIS, told me over 
the phone. “Well, you’re wrong.”

George, who directed IRIS for eighteen years, 
saw community co-sponsorship as his most 
important project at the agency. He was spurred by 
the need to assist growing populations of displaced 
people, along with the heightened visibility of the 
Syrian refugee crisis in 2015—what the UNHCR still 
calls the largest refugee crisis in the world. George 
and other IRIS leaders then established their own 
community co-sponsorship program, pushing a 
number of public information sessions to recruit 
what would eventually grow a state-wide network 
of over fifty co-sponsorship groups. 

Historically, refugee resettlement has operated 
through a case management model, in which a case 
manager or social worker is assigned to a refugee 
family to provide assistance. This limits participa-
tion to trained professionals, often with bachelor’s 
degrees and a few years of experience in social 
work. Public involvement, at most, took the form 
of donations or lower-commitment volunteer roles 
like providing transportation for families or tutor-
ing English. But around 2015, community leaders 
across New Haven and Connecticut approached 
George, wishing to do more. 

“There was a distant memory of church or 
faith-based co-sponsorship,” George told me, 
referencing what he called an “informal network” 
of co-sponsorship from the nineteen-eighties. 
This was the original version, created to accom-
modate waves of Southeast Asian displacement 
after U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War and 
Secret War in Laos. Often, these co-sponsors 
were local church groups working in collabora-
tion with the USRAP. 

With its board, George combined IRIS’ orga-
nizational team structure with the everyday, infor-
mal volunteer force of those faith-based sponsors. 
They expanded co-sponsorship, both in capacity 
and demographic, by allowing any group of people 
to become sponsors, so long as their group was or 
became an established legal entity and had enough 
dedicated volunteers—typically upwards of twenty. 
Groups also needed proof that they could provide 
financial, cultural, and other practical assistance to 
a refugee family for at least one year.
This ragtag model had undeniable suc-
cesses. In 2016, IRIS’ first full year of community 
co-sponsorship, the agency and its co-sponsors 
welcomed 530 refugees—“more than double 
any previous year,” according to IRIS’ website. 
These numbers were considerably larger than 
Connecticut’s other two major resettlement 
agencies the same year. Hartford Catholic 
Charities, which lacks a report for the 2016 fis-
cal year, was estimated by the Archdiocese of 
Hartford to have resettled 360. The Connecticut 
Institute for Refugees and Immigrants (CIRI) 
resettled 127 (though CIRI does focus on provid-
ing its families up to five years of assistance). 

IRIS’ growth with community sponsorship is 
still going strong. The agency has gone from a 
pre-2016 annual average of two hundred resettle-
ment cases to one thousand, expanding from cases 
of refugee resettlement to cases of asylum seekers 
and some immigrants. This success soon attracted 
national attention, bringing the IRIS agency to 
the center of the Welcome Corps itself. The agen-
cy’s role in the Welcome Corps: to support and 
provide information sessions to Welcome Corps 
applicants across the country as they build their 
own scaled-down versions of the New Haven 
co-sponsorship model. 

“There is a pressure from the United States 
public, for us to open up to democratize refu-
gee resettlement,” George told me. “Peace Corps 
invited ordinary people to participate in foreign 
policy, right? This is a foreign policy program that 
operates in our own backyard, but we were not 
allowing public citizens [to participate] in a signif-
icant way. And now we are.” 

The Welcome Corps is meant to supplement—
not replace—the USRAP, where UNHCR-approved 
refugees are sponsored by a network of ten national 
volunteer agencies and smaller professional affil-
iates like IRIS. Welcome Corps sponsors work in 
small Private Sponsorship Groups (PSGs) of at least 
five U.S. citizens. While the Welcome Corps adds 
onto the U.S.’ capacity to resettle refugees, sponsor 
groups are still responsible for providing the same 
services as existing agencies: greeting families at 
the airport, finding and furnishing housing, seek-
ing employment, and serving as guides to local 
communities and American culture. 

PSGs have two options to welcome a refugee 
family. The first is Matching, the random pairing 
of a sponsor group with a refugee family. When 
the Welcome Corps first launched, this was the 
only option available in the program’s first phase. 
Then, in December 2023, the second phase of the 
Welcome Corps introduced the Naming program—
also called Sponsor a Refugee You Know—where 
PSGs could apply to sponsor a specific refugee living 
abroad. This development expanded the scope of 
who could sponsor a refugee family and who could 
be sponsored.
Yazan first stumbled upon the Welcome Corps 
website when it was still in the first phase. At this 
time, Yazan hadn’t started employment at IRIS 
and was working with an immigration lawyer in 
New Haven, looking for ways to get his family to 
the States sooner. The Welcome Corps wasn’t yet 
what he’d needed, but the idea stuck with him. 

When Yazan had opened the Phase 2 launch 
email in December, he left work early to assemble 
his own PSG. He drove straight to his uncle’s house in 
Farmington, and later that night, to a friend’s house 
in New Britain. Yazan’s father would have joined, 
Yazan told me, but he doesn’t yet have full citizen-
ship. “I told them about Welcome Corps, explained 
everything to them,” Yazan told me, “and they were 
like, ‘Yeah. We’ll do it.’” Eventually, all five of them—
Yazan, his uncle, his uncle’s wife, and two friends—
gathered to sign off the forms for their background 
checks, committing them as private sponsors.
With over sixty-five thousand approved spon-
sors in the Welcome Corps and another eleven 


21
thousand applications currently in progress, the 
desire among everyday people—and burgeon-
ing diasporic communities—to open their doors 
is clear. And as the Welcome Corps adapts IRIS’ 
co-sponsorship model for smaller volunteer groups 
and diffuses it across the nation, both supporters 
and critics wonder: will this expansion really work 
on a national scale? 

Make No Assumptions
J
ean silk lit a candle  on her windowsill and 
prayed: God, I’m gonna find that woman. 

It was February 2016, Silk’s third month in 
charge of the Jewish Community Alliance for 
Refugee Resettlement (JCARR), a role she’d taken 
on after decades of work in international educa-
tion and social action. “I’m not tired, and I’m not 
retired,” she’d later tell me. 

JCARR, a partnership of five local synagogues 
and the Jewish Federation of Greater New Haven, 
was established in December 2015 as an IRIS com-
munity co-sponsor. Only a month after its incep-
tion, JCARR welcomed its first refugee family: three 
siblings in their 20s from the Democratic Republic 
of Congo. 

Silk was looking for Marie, who was mar-
ried to the eldest brother of the family. The last to 
arrive in the U.S., Marie and their 2-year-old son 
had been sent to Indianapolis and were supposed 
to take a bus from there to New York. She’d then 
meet with her husband and a volunteer from JCARR, 
and they’d all take the Metro North back to New 
Haven together. When it was time for Marie to 
arrive at the Port Authority Bus Terminal, the vol-
unteer called Silk. Marie and her son were missing. 

Oh my god, Silk had thought. “I never asked 
if she spoke English. I never asked if she had a 
cell phone. I never asked if she was wearing a sign 
that says ‘I’m going to New Haven, send me to 
Jean Silk.’”
In New Haven, Silk spent the next five hours 
poring over bus routes, calling police officers from 
small-town stops in Pennsylvania, all the way to 
Port Authority. She thought about taking the 
late-night train to New York to find Marie herself. 
“But there were a lot of angels working that night,” 
she said. Around midnight, a Port Authority 
baggage employee called Silk’s phone, saying 
he was with Marie and her son. An officer also 
called from Port Authority, informing Silk that 
he deals with women and children—often vic-
tims of human trafficking. That officer took Marie 
and her son to Grand Central Station, where they 
boarded the train to New Haven. Accompanied by 
a “Good Samaritan” on the Metro North, Marie 
and her son finally arrived at Union Station at 2 
a.m., where Silk and Marie’s husband were wait-
ing for them. 

That night, Silk told me, she learned a crucial 
lesson about the work of refugee resettlement: 
“Make no assumptions.” Helping Marie and her 
family had been Silk’s first resettlement case, and 
she had assumed that Marie had everything she 
needed to get to New Haven—despite traveling 
with an infant in an unfamiliar country. 

In an attempt to “expect the unexpected,” 
as Silk had put it, the process of becoming an 
approved community co-sponsorship group with 
IRIS is a rigorous one. IRIS requires each volun-
teer to complete a background check, register for 
liability insurance, read a thirty-page co-sponsor 
program manual, and complete a six-hour training 
session on their new responsibilities. IRIS also rec-
ommends that co-sponsor groups raise $4,000 to 
$10,000—enough to provide three to six months of 
financial assistance, mostly with rent. 

Eight years since the Port Authority incident, 
Silk and JCARR have resettled eight families and 
are currently working with their ninth—the most 
of any community co-sponsorship group that IRIS 
has worked with. But with the initial vetting and 
preparation that JCARR had gone through, and this 
near-decade of experience, Silk has found that 
maxim—make no assumptions—to be consistently 
true. The commitment to resettling a refugee fam-
ily can easily become more than the community and 
goodwill that well-intentioned sponsors may have 
bargained for. 

“I always say this,” Silk told me, “Refugee 
resettlement is not romantic. It’s really hard work. 
Those phone calls come at any hour of the day or 
night, and you don’t always know the answer, but 
you feel like you need to come up with one.”
In a more extreme case, Silk recalls an instance 
of domestic violence within one of the fami-
