Haven—how will it transform across the U.S.?

L
ast december, Yazan Al Doumani received 
an email he’d been waiting thirteen years for. He 
was at an office desk in West Hartford during 
what had been an unassuming workday at Integrated 
Refugee & Immigrant Services (IRIS). But that after-
noon, an office director sent a staff-wide message 
announcing the launch of a public initiative that 
could allow Yazan to see his family finally.

Yazan immediately opened the homepage 
of the Welcome Corps, a national program that 
launched in January 2023. It allows ordinary U.S. 
citizens to voluntarily sponsor refugee families and 
assist them toward self-sufficiency in the States. 
Have you watched the news unfolding around the 
world, read an earlier version of the website, and 
wished there was something you could do? Yazan 
thought of his mother, Abir, his brothers, Ghaith 
and Yaman, and his sister, Joudi. The four are still 
currently 5,633 miles away in Jordan, where they 
have been since their displacement at the 2011 out-
break of the Syrian civil war. 
“I had a feeling inside that—oh my god—my 
family could actually come soon to [this] country and 
I can reunite with them here,” Yazan would later tell 
me. He began his application to become a Welcome 
Corps sponsor. He began to hope for the best. 
Yazan is 22 years old, an assistant of IRIS’ 
Housing & Donations team, and a student at 
Central Connecticut State. He has a penchant for 
Premier League soccer and—“it’s gonna sound 
weird,” he warned me—teeth. He’s studying 
pre-dentistry, and tells me that tooth enamel is 
stronger than rocks. 
Yazan was born in the U.S., but his family 
moved to Syria soon after, where they lived until 
the beginning of the war. He was 8 when he moved 
back to the States as a U.S. citizen. Yazan was joined 
only by his father, Mohamed, whose visa had been 
approved by the Department of State. Meanwhile, 
the visa applications of Yazan’s mother, brothers, 
and sister had all been denied.

In 2011, the year Yazan’s family was separated, 
Mohamed filed their family’s claims with the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees (UNHCR). If approved, the rest of the 
family could join them by UNHCR referral to the U.S. 
Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP), first insti-
tuted by the Refugee Act of 1980. In the meantime, 
both sides of the family had to build something of 
a new life—living, working, waiting for reunion. 
Yazan calls his mother and siblings on FaceTime 
almost daily, but it’s been two years since he last 
saw them when he visited Jordan. Thirteen years 
have passed since they were separated, with no 
update on the status of their refugee claims.

As a Welcome Corps sponsor, Yazan can pro-
vide what may become a crucial means for dias-
poric communities across the U.S. to reunite with 
their loved ones. As of this year, about six hundred 
fifty-four thousand Syrians in Jordan are officially 
registered as refugees with the UNHCR, and over 
one-third of them have been separated from their 
families. This statistic still doesn’t account for the 
1.3 million displaced Syrians in Jordan who either 
haven’t registered for legal refugee status or still 
await approval. 
With a grassroots approach towards refu-
gee resettlement in the U.S., the Welcome Corps 
pushes the boundaries of a field long domi-
nated by professional resettlement agencies and
