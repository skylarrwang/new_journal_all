Today my closet fell down and I cried. 
How does a closet fall down? the inquisitive 
reader might wonder. The truth is that I 
have no closet––I have two tension rods. 

Many months ago, when I was a tension 
rod virgin and the world was beautiful, I 
arrived at my humble Old Campus suite 
after my roommate. She got the desk 
next to the window and the singular 
closet bar. I got the empty, bar-less side of 
our L-shaped “closet.” Amazon tension 
rods it was. (Was this my mistake? My 
tears a punishment for lazy participation 
in late-stage capitalism?) 

I placed the silver rods as so: one 
higher and farther back in the cavity and 
the other lower and in front. I called them 
Rodrigo (no, not Olivia––I am not a fan. 
Repetitive themes and lacking lyrics) and 
Mitt Rodney (also not a fan). They began 
level. Days passed, and Rodney’s right arm 
slipped an inch. Slipped two. Rodrigo 
followed. On one fateful day, Rodrigo 
and Rodney lost their pathetic grip on the 
stucco walls and crashed to the cold floor. I 
cried. I contemplated extricating the plas-
tic hangers and beloved dress straps and 
jacket sleeves and heavy coats. I elected, 
instead, to pick out items one by one, day 
by day, like a guilty ferret with her slowly 
dwindling stash. Eventually, the rods were 
emptied and reinstalled anew. 

This cycle has repeated for nine 
months, culminating always in Rodrigo 
and Rodney’s special time of strife (come 
to think of it, we might be synced). And of 
course, the deluge of fabric coincides with 
the Worst. Day. Ever. Terrible French exam. 
Crash. Mother on FaceTime squints at 
the spreading acne on my chin. Crash. 
International Holocaust Remembrance 
Day (my grandmother’s a survivor). Crash. 
Today was different. Today my closet 
fell down, and, dear reader, something 
wonderful happened: I did not cry for 
the dust-stained button-downs or gar-
gantuan collection of black boots (can 
one have too many?) buried beneath the 
rubble. I cried for the French exam and 
acne-scarred chin and the Holocaust, 
for the people I miss and papers I need 
to write, for climate change and war and 
time. I did not let the clothes rest on the 
floor for a week, or two, or six (my current 
record). I picked them up, while I wept 
and wept and wept. 

Sometimes you need to cry, and the 
tension rod gods bless you in a dorm 
room closet.
