know about the Quinnipiac is misunderstood.” He grins, pulls up a map of New 
Haven on his phone, and proceeds to tell 
me some history.
The Quinnipiac land spanned much 
of what we now know as the New 
Haven area; interrelated bands inhab-
ited neighboring villages in what is now 
East Haven, Branford, and the northern 
part of New Haven. After the British 
had established themselves as the politi-
cally dominant force in the area with the 
Treaty of Hartford,  Theophilus Eaton 
and John Davenport—the English 
founders of New Haven—created the 
Momauguin Treaty. The 1638 Treaty 
ascribed total agency to the Quinnipiac 
principal sachem, Momauguin, to sell 
the land without consulting the sachems 
of other Native bands. The Quinnipiac 
were then pushed onto a 1,200-acre par-
cel, the only land where they could plant, 
hunt, or build without English permis-
sion—one of the first forms of a reserva-
tion in the United States.
Over time, colonists encroached 
upon the reservations as Quinnipiac 
people sold tracts and rights to pay for 
exorbitant petty crime fines, leading to 
recurrent conflicts over the boundar-
ies of the reservation by the late seven-teenth century. In 1731, nearly all of the 
Quinnipiac reservation had been bought 
by colonists, and most of the Quinnipiac 
emigrated to nearby Connecticut towns, 
far from the river they called home. 
Many Quinnipiac descendents, looking 
to preserve their sense of independence, 
joined the Brothertown movement later 
in the eighteenth century. They went 
west, converting to Christianity and 
settling in Wisconsin. Others joined 
different nearby tribes, including the 
Pequot. The Quinnipiac no longer exist 
as a recognized community though their 
descendants live on.
On his phone, Smith zooms in on 
Cross Campus, right by Harkness Hall. 
“If you’re talking about where Yale is, 
in the New Haven region, these were 
traditionally hunting grounds.” New 
Haven served as a shared land for the 
Quinnipiac bands, a living space for 
them to listen to the natural world.
Nakai Northup, the head educator 
at the museum and a member of the 
Mashantucket Pequot and Narragansett 
tribes, sustains his connection to the 
land through far more than twenty sec-
onds of a land acknowledgment. “The 
land is my therapist,” he says, patting 
the dirt beneath us. He refers to it as his 
“close friend,” a being that he continually 
spends time with, one that frustrates him, 
one that partners with him through life. 
“We’ve been here for two thou-
sand-plus years, so that’s a long time to 
form a relationship,” Northup says. He 
can identify the plants around us by their 
Algonquian name. When he looks out, 
he sees details that I cannot. And that 
gaze was forged through time—his and 
the generations before him. He tells me 
about hunting for an animal, an act that 
Connecticut land sustained for thousands 
of years. “You can learn how [an animal] 
built a relationship with the land and the 
things that it relies on within the land and 
how the land relies on it for other things. 
And then you throw yourself in that 
mix. I guess that puts me in that cycle as 
well.” The kinship between the earth and 
Northup animates his stories. 
Driving back, I turn on my GPS and 
return toward New Haven. The maps, 
trees, and signs grow richer than on my 
drive there. The Quinnipiac River was 
where they found their food. Sachem’s 
Head came from an old tale about a tribal 
conflict. And Saybrook was where the 
Pequot War culminated. Behind each of 
these names dwells a richness of the land, 
easy to overlook when driving, but clearer 
to see after talking with Northup and 
Smith.

Back at Yale, I walk into the 
Native American Culture Center 
(NACC) and am greeted by the house 
staff, peer liaisons, and NACC Director 
and Assistant Dean of Yale College 
Matthew Makomenaw, all seated at 
a long table by the entrance. Bright 
colors 
surround 
them—construc-
tion paper, markers, candy wrappers, 
bowls, wall art. Each person is writ-
ing welcome letters to recently admit-
ted Indigenous students. Their laughs 
and excitement flow into pages of 
kind words. 
“First and foremost, we’re a stu-
dent center, a place for Indigenous 
students to center themselves and 
find resources,” says Makomenaw, one 
of the Grand Traverse Bay Band of 
Ottawa and Chippewa people. “Even 
though we don’t all come from the 
same tribal nation or culture, we build 
a place where people are comfortable, 
and they have friendships, and they 
have mentorship, and they have a 
space that they can center themselves.” 
Later that day, I speak with 
Naima Blanco-Norberg ’25, a Mexica 
Arts Liaison, sitting on a couch in 
the library, cradled by books, maps, 
and portraits of Henry Roe Cloud, 
the first recognized Indigenous Yale 
graduate. She nods to a large map 
on the wall which shows the lay-
out of different nations in North 
America. “It’s little things like that,” 
she tells me, “the books and the art 
which make a tie to indigeneity cen-
tered in this space, even though it’s 
a community of so many different 
communities.” As we leave, I pass by 
an activities room. To the left, a long 
table stands, with thousands of beads 
in boxes beside. “We get funding for 
them every year, and it’s a good activ-
ity since it’s something so many of us 
share,” says Megan Blackwell ’25, a 
Chickasaw Peer Liaison. With beads, 
pow-wows, and conferences spanning 
back to the nineteen-eighties, the 
Indigenous community at Yale has 
forged their own traditions. 
Yale’s current land acknowledg-
ment makes a small gesture towards 
the existence of these living commu-
nities but fails to do more than name 
them. “A land acknowledgment isn’t 
just something you say,” Megan tells 
me. “It has to be something you com-
mit to. You have to commit to teaching 
these histories.”
What would it mean for the 
words in Yale’s land acknowledg-
ment to signify anything more than 
just names? Discomfort is an essen-
tial part of a land acknowledgment, 
Tarren Andrews, assistant professor 
of Ethnicity, Race, and Migration, 
says. “Commitments allow for insti-
tutional land acknowledgments to go 
beyond their affective potential,” she 
tells me. “Acknowledgments are a way 
to make institutions that care a lot 
about performance put money behind 
the performance.” An unsettling land 
acknowledgment can sow the seeds of 
discomfort to spur institutional action. 
To Northup and Andrews, a land 
acknowledgment should spawn an 
institutional relationship grounded in 
mutual care. Northup told me about 
other institutions, like the University of 
Connecticut, where administrators vis-
ited the Mashantucket Pequot museum 
and spoke with staff while drafting their 
land acknowledgement. Administrators 
and 
museum 
staff 
shared 
meals. 
Beyond writing their statement in dia-
logue with Indigenous educators, the 
University of Connecticut commit-
ted to hiring Indigenous faculty and 
partnered with the museum to create 
educational programs that centered 
Indigenous relationships to land.
Last year, Nyché presented a detailed 
proposal to the Yale College Council 
to support the creation of a Native and 
Indigenous Studies major, along with the 
development of more Indigenous studies 
courses and hiring of more Indigenous 
faculty. Megan and Andrews have each 
articulated the importance of all Yale 
College students learning the Indigenous 
history of this land, something embed-
ded in the other land acknowledgments 
like those of the University of Colorado 
Boulder and Cornell University, which 
provide detailed educational resources 
about local Indigenous groups.
