doesn’t think regulations will change until 
recreational fishermen go out and protest. 
Lapinski recalled two January 2024 
hearings by the Atlantic States Marine 
Fisheries Commission, where he was 
one of two appointed representatives 
for recreational fishermen. At the hear-
ings, they discussed striped bass quotas 
after a severe population decline in the 
species. Of over one hundred thousand 
private anglers residing in Connecticut, 
just over fifty submitted written com-
ments. Forty-one came to the in-per-
son hearings; only nine of them were 
recreational fishermen. 

Many of the fishermen I talked to 
were fast to complain about overregu-
lation, but few had the time or desire 
to fight it. 

On one visit to Dee’s, I met a 
70-something-year-old angler in a grey 
tracksuit. I asked him if he was inter-
ested in talking about issues in fishing.
“Nah, not really,” he said. The drive 
to New Haven was too far. I told him 
I could call him over the phone if he 
didn’t want to come down.
“Nah,” he said again. “Most of the 
time, if I’m at home, I’m fishing.” 
That was hard to argue with.
“I’ve never been a fan of the ‘throw 
up your hands and walk away; it is what 
it is,’” Lapinski said. “But the private 
anglers definitely fall that way.” 
DeGregorio recalled unsuccessful 
attempts from years ago to rally anglers 
statewide to attend town meetings—
after weeks of planning, only four peo-
ple showed up. Today, DeGregorio is 
tired. He tells me he’s been meaning to 
write to the commissioner expressing 
his grievances, but the store is always 
overrun with customers, and he hates 
using email.

For the fishermen on Connecticut’s 
shores today, their passions lie out on 
the water, not inside committee rooms. 
Meanwhile, the new generation is too 
young to remember the heritage they 
have lost. 

“You have to remember something 
to appreciate it,” Job said. “I’m trying to 
put things out there, to get volunteers 
involved again, to try and have them 
remember these fish exist.” 
Job is hopeful about Amendment 
10 of the Atlantic Herring Fishery 
Management Plan, an upcoming nego-
tiation on catch caps and limits on 
commercial fisheries. He’s relying on 
anglers to use their voices, but has also 
turned to birders, photographers, ecol-
ogists, long-time residents, and anyone 
who has a story from the water. 

“It’s our inherent nature, as hunt-
er-gatherers,” DeGregorio said. “Fishing 
is tradition. It’s a primordial instinct.”
Waist-deep in water, Potkay casts 
out his line. It whips over the river 
with a magnificent swoosh. Lure bag 
slung over one shoulder, orange fish-
hooker clipped to his chest, rod extended 
and arms unmoving, he stands still like a 
lighthouse under the squinting sun. 
Out here, I can understand why 
Boyer believes in karma. Fishing is man 
versus nature: Potkay says he’s been 
dragged down by the tide several times 
now, and someone else told me about 
their near-death ice-fishing experience. 
The only refuge these fishermen have is 
in each other. 

“If I get a hook stuck in my fin-
ger, you’d have to help me pull it out,” 
Potkay warns me.
He hasn’t caught any fish today. Maybe 
there are fewer stripers in the river. Maybe 
it’s too windy. Potkay isn’t concerned about 
the former. For now, there are still fish in 
the ocean, and as long as they are there, 
I’m realizing, there are also avid surfcasters 
smart enough to catch them. 

And still, Potkay fights to preserve 
fishing in his own way. I watch him 
wave for a younger fisherman to join 
him. The two of them stand shoul-
der-to-shoulder in the water, wind 
against their backs, throwing their reels 
toward the horizon together. 

By the time we reach the parking lot, 
Potkay is noticeably more relaxed and 
talkative. He buys me a coffee. When my 
ride home is delayed, without hesitation, 
he starts clearing out the backseat of his 
car, where I sit for the next twenty min-
utes sandwiched between crates of fishing 
equipment on the way back to New Haven.
It’s strange to watch him, an 
ordinary person behind the wheel, 
without his enormous rubber boots, 
camouflage waders, and larger-than-
life mythos. But if fishing is a kind of 
heritage, this, too, is it—to offer lifts 
to college students, to stand shoul-
der-to-shoulder bearing the same water. 

After Job takes off in his pickup 
truck, carting a green oxygen tank 
behind him, to continue his fish-search-
ing, I meet a lone fisherman on the 
bridge. His hook nose is flushed red 
with cold, glasses fogged up. His name 
is Peter Graves. He lives across the river. 
He caught his first pickerel in 1952. He 
has a PhD in microbiology and spent 
decades in virus and disease research. 
Maybe this makes sense because he 
thinks fishing is an exercise in intellect. 
“You gotta fool a fish, right?” he tells 
me. “You gotta be as smart as they are!”  
When he tells me this, he pats 
me on the shoulder and lets out a 
laugh like a gently-rusted door hinge. 
Immediately, I decide I like him. We 
exchange names, then fish stories, then 
emails, and a promise to stay in touch.  
I walk back to the dam and stand 
over the pooling water. I stare hard 
at how it passes through the fishway: 
turbulent on top, calm underneath. I 
imagine everything Graves and Job 
have told me, picturing runs of ale-
wives thick like ribbons, flashing sil-
ver, and cerulean beneath my feet. In a 
moment so sharp I almost believe it, I 
see something twist beneath the water. 
Momentarily, it flashes, before it ripples 
into either memory or possibility. ∎
