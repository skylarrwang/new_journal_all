EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Ray Potkay knows how to trick a fish. 
“It’s all about patience,” he tells 
me, reeling in the line with a learned 
slowness. He teaches me to pull up twice: 
once to yank the lure forward, again to 
pull it sideways, so that the striped bass 
thinks the fake fish is injured. 

Potkay’s not a big talker. What he 
lacks in verbosity he compensates for 
in spunk: he has pierced ears, silver 
glasses, and a trim beard. He smokes 
a cigar while he fishes. He won’t call 
himself the best, but he does call him-
self “The Fabulous Fisherman” on 
Facebook, where he’s achieved micro-
celebrity status within Connecticut 
fishing circles. 

“Don’t write about where we are, or 
else it’ll get blown up by everybody,” 
he tells me with dead seriousness. I’m 
trudging behind his rubber-booted 
footsteps down a winding forest path. In 
the parking lot behind us are his SUV, 
my handbag, and an array of crushed 
bottles. And before us, the Housatonic 
River unfurls into crystalline silver. 

There’s something Whitmanesque 
about fishing, and it’s more than 
the stars and stripes emblazoned on 
Potkay’s pliers as he retwists the hook 
on his lure. Out on the water, it’s 
every man for himself. It’s tough. It’s 
American. It’s disproportionately dom-
inated by middle-aged white guys post-
ing pictures of themselves dangling 
giant mackerels on Facebook. 

“It’s the greatest sport in the world,” 
says Pete DeGregorio, owner of Dee’s 
Bait & Tackle, a beloved New Haven 
fixture since 1954. 

Potkay and DeGregorio are two 
among a dozen-something local fish-
ermen whom I talked to over the past 
month. An almost-fanatical commu-
nity, for decades, these individuals 
have called Connecticut’s nearly six 
thousand miles of shoreline, rivers, 
and streams home. They go fishing 
before dawn and past midnight; they 
chase wraithlike herring and savage 
bluefish; they spend months finding 
the best places to fish, and the rest of 
their lives keeping them secret from 
other fishermen.

“I mean,  it’s just a euphoric time,” 
says Randy Boyer, a DJ-turned-fisherman 
who runs his own lure-making business. 
“When you’re fishing, the world kind of 
melts away.” 

Like many fishermen, Boyer learned 
angling—fishing with a rod and line—
from his parents growing up. But today, 
a tangle of bureaucracy, legislation, 
and commercialization threatens the 
very spirit of recreational fishing and 
the local communities who sustain it. 

Massive Atlantic fisheries encroach on 
fishermen’s catches, driving once-abun-
dant fish species to historic lows in 
Connecticut’s rivers. Angling—which 
has attracted intrepid fishermen to New 
England’s shores since the sixteen hun-
dreds—now faces an uncertain future. 

And the latest generation of anglers 
must reckon with what’s worth fighting 
for and what legacy is worth preserving.


Growing up, Kevin Job was the “fish 
kid.” When he was six, he saw a fly 
fisher returning from the sea-scuffed 
shore, holding a fat striper in his hands. 
This fly fisher taught Job the art of 
striped bass fishing: to throw the lure 
into a school of herring, to watch the 
herring scatter and the bass lunge for 
the lure instead. 

Hook, line, and sinker, Job fell for 
fishing. With almost religious fervor, he 
searched for the best herring spots, the 
best time of day to fish them, and the 
best season for fishing. He attended the 
University of Connecticut to study fish-
eries—there, he cut class and skipped 
sleep to fish more. Spring became his 
“happy time,” when runs and runs of sil-
very herring splashed through the rivers. 

“People would go on vacations with 
their family, and all I did was fish,” Job 
tells me, stretching out the all like taffy. 

Twenty years later, sporting sunglasses, 
blue flannel, and a slight surfer’s drawl, 
the 34-year-old Job works as a fisher-
ies biologist for the CT Department of 
Energy and Environmental Protection 
(DEEP). He’s eased better into the fish-
kid persona.

We’re standing atop a seven-
teen-foot dam, talking over the roar 
of a waterfall. Here, a fishway guides 
newly spawned river herring—ale-
wives in the fall, and blueback herring 
months later—from the quietude of 
the Branford Supply Pond into the 
Atlantic. Come fall, adult herring will 
migrate back in droves to the pond 
to spawn again. They serve as prey 
for striped bass, the “king of all fish,” 
according to DeGregorio, which are 
coveted all across the Atlantic. 

But today, the fishway sits empty. 
In the past ten years, the dense herring 
runs of Job’s childhood have all but dis-
appeared. Job estimates that there were 
ten thousand herring in this very fish-
way in 2013. So far, this year, the dam’s 
fish-counter has recorded twenty-three. 

“This is literally my job to look for 
these [fish]. I go out at night, and I 
struggle to find them,” Job says. “It sucks. 
Like it’s really, really frustrating.”

Over the past four decades, blueback 
herring populations in the Connecticut 
River have decreased from six hundred 
twenty-three thousand to just over two 
thousand. Once-fanatical fishermen are 
reckoning with the disappearance of their 
favorite species. For Riefe Tietjen—a 
self-proclaimed “one-trick pony,” who 
spent thirty years perfecting the art 
of hunting infamously vicious blue-
fish—this meant finding new species to 
chase when bluefish “were just no longer 
around,” ten years ago. 

61-year-old Dave LaFrance also 
recalls catching the bluefish which had 
swarmed the waters of Lighthouse 
Point since he was a 14-year-old boy. 
“Then three years ago, they vanished,” 
LaFrance told me.

He’s not the only one missing their 
favorite catch. As Job and I talk, an 
osprey dives down from the tree, then 
swerves up, talons empty. 

“In theory, he should have a nice sil-
ver fish in his talons,” Job says, craning 
his neck to watch the bird dip back into 
the horizon. If he’s lucky, Job explains, 
he might resurface with a pre-hatched 
trout placed in the pond by the state. But 
there’s no herring on the menu today. 

The heyday of Connecticut’s fish-
ing was in the nineteen-seventies and 
eighties, I’m told again and again, when 
anglers chased fish freely and plentily. 
Now, the most dedicated fishermen 
on the shoreline are getting older. The 
generational gap haunts younger people 
growing up on the water, many of whom 
have never seen a migration of hundreds 
of herring, or know it existed at all. Job 
acknowledges his own 34-year-old age as 
a bit of an anomaly. 

“How can you protect something if 
you don’t know it exists?” Job asked. 


Since New England anglers first 
sounded the alarm on herring pop-
ulations in the nineteen-nineties, the 
state has invested tens of millions of 
dollars into environmental cleanup 
and fishways connecting the river her-
ring to freshwater sanctuaries. A com-
plete ban on river herring fishing was 
instituted in 2002. Three years ago, the 
state even sponsored DEEP, where Job 
works, to place nine thousand pre-
spawned fish into the Shetucket River 
in Eastern Connecticut. 

But each time, the outcome is the 
same. Nine thousand fish come in to 
spawn. Nine thousand fish swim out to 
the ocean. And then the fish never return. 

The culprit, lying just a couple miles 
away from shore, seems obvious to 
most private anglers. Enormously obvi-
ous. Massive commercial boats, tow-
ing miles-long nets along the Atlantic 
seafloor, snag river herring as bycatch—
unintentionally 
caught 
wildlife—in 
their operations. Even though they tar-
get Atlantic herring and mackerel, any 
fish ensnared by their nets can be killed 
and sold for profit. Other times, when 
they’re over the poundage limit, they’ll 
toss smaller dead fish by the hundreds 
back into the ocean. In a four-year 
period, these trawls have caught an esti-
mated 6.6 million alewives as bycatch in 
Southern New England. 

“For every five thousand pounds 
of butterfish they caught, they swept 
over ten thousand pounds of bycatch,” 
DeGregorio says, shaking his head. “The 
slaughter is crazy.”

Eighteen years ago, DeGregorio 
inherited Dee’s Bait & Tackle’s brick-
and-mortar storefront and loyal clien-
tele from his father. A self-proclaimed 
family man and U.S. history buff, 
DeGregorio has been running this store 
like a relic of Melville’s America. He 
doesn’t use email or voicemail. He keeps 
a battered box of IOUs from customers to 
whom he’s lent supplies or money. Early 
customers get his attention by banging 
on the outside window (he responds by 
hollering back that they open at noon). 

As one customer told me, “It doesn’t get 
more grassroots than Dee’s.” 

DeGregorio tells me the pilgrims 
came to America in response to two 
injustices: religious persecution, and that 
only the rich could fish the king’s waters. 

While commercial fisheries, thanks 
to major lobbying clout, get off the 
hook with overfishing and bycatch, rec-
reational fishing licenses are getting 
more expensive. Anglers need to pur-
chase saltwater licenses, in addition to 
freshwater licenses, in addition to trout 
management stamps, in addition to 
government-issued rulebooks which lay 
out all of this. One of these rulebooks 
sits bound on DeGregorio’s counter at 
Dee’s Bait & Tackle, which he gestures 
to frequently and impatiently through-
out our conversation. Over fifty pages of 
printed graphs, tables, and legends, the 
book describes the state’s response to 
declines in herring and striper popula-
tions, which includes new regulations on 
the size, place, time, number, and species 
recreational fishermen can catch. 

Everyone I talked to had something 
to say about the extensive rule changes. 
They deter new families from picking up 
fishing, while the old guard is exhausted. 
Some are even deserting—one man I 
talked to cited fishing as one among 
a variety of reasons he was moving to 
Florida. Statewide, recreational fishing 
participation has declined by over fifty 
percent in the past three decades, from 
one hundred and fifty thousand people 
in 1990 to only one hundred thousand 
in 2021, according to the Census Bureau. 

What’s lost is not just people who fish: 
it’s the collective memories—taking their 
kids down to the coast, witnessing an 
ecosystem run vibrant with wildlife, shar-
ing fresh catch and conversation with 
neighbors over dinner. 

“I lost my culture,” Job said. “I mean, 
it’s gone. You have to work really hard 
to recreate what I used to be able to do 
when I was ten.”


Job doesn’t think the problems will 
go away until regulations around com-
mercial fishing change. But Toby Lapinski, 
lifelong angler and editor-in-chief of the 
national magazine Fishing Tackle Retailer,
