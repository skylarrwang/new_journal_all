E
arlier this month, I stood in front of a high-school 
class and tried my best to make eye contact. But 
high-school was nerve-wracking enough the first 
time around. I started out like any new kid: I made a joke 
about not being able to find a date. It got a decent laugh 
(apparently, it didn't seem that implausible). Then, armed 
with facts, figures, and handouts on juvenile justice reform, 
I asked these 27 New Haven teenagers to help me organize 
in support of a bill to change what I view to be one of the 
most unfair judicial policies in the country. 
I explained what has always shocked me: Connecticut 
is one of only three states that automatically charges six-
teen and seventeen-year-olds as adults for any crime they 
commit (New York and North Carolina are the other two). 
Connecticut also sends more juveniles to prison (383 last 
year) than any other state. This policy disproportionately 
affects those already at risk: kids with untreated emotional 
disabilities whose parents have them arrested because they 
can't afford psychological treatment; kids on parole who 
go to jail for statutory offenses like chronic truancy; wards 
of the state who run away from foster homes (technically 
a violation of a court order and, hence, an incarcerable of-
fence). The list goes on. 

The issue has always seemed morally clear to me. 
There are children in prison-some in solitary confinement 
for 23 hours a day-for crimes so minor that the whole 
February 2007 
thing would seem like a sick joke if it weren't true. 
But I still found it difficult to explain this outrage to 
sixteen and seventeen-year olds-the very group the 
policy affects. 

New Haven Academy is a small charter high 
school housed in a bland glass box of a building in 
Hamden. The curriculum is experimental, and my 
student audience was working on an interesting se-
nior project: They had to choose an issue of social 
importance and organize around it. With the assis-
tance of a Yale faculty member, I had contacted the 
principal, explained my cause, and negotiated an 
hour of class time on a Friday afternoon to present 
the issue and discuss the fundamentals of organizing 
a social justice campaign. 

Hoping to elicit a chord of sympathy, I recited a 
long list of injustices: Connecticut is out of step with 
the rest of the nation in regards to its juvenile criminal 
policies. Unfairly, even non-violent juvenile offend-
ers in Connecticut must go through the adult justice 
system. Once convicted, they abuse from guards and 
older prisoners and are given access to neither therapy, 
drug treatment, nor the many educational resources 
offered in juvenile facilities. A felony record disquali-
fies juveniles from receiving Pell Grants for college 
and bars them from a number of jobs; juveniles tried 
as adults are more likely to be re-incarcerated than 
those tried as juveniles.

stead of behind a desk, I was forced 
to confront a question I hadn't antic-
ipated: To what extent was I encour-
aging these students to form their 
own conclusions, and to what extent 
was I leading them to mine? Who was 
I to come swooping in with statistics, 
and lecture the New Haven youth 
on what was good for them? In a city 
in which youth violence is on the 
rise, there is often little sympathy for 
juvenile offenders. "The situation is · 
bad,'' I imagined them saying. "This 
is no time for your statistics." 

I 
was expounding on the 
long-term benefits of juvenile 
as 
opposed to adult detention facili-
ties 
when one student raised his 
hand and told me that, according to 
his friend who was recently released 
from juvie, kids there have access to 
Playstation 3 and can curse out their 
guards and nothing happens to them. 
He wondered how juvenile inmates 
are supposed to learn right from 
wrong if they can do whatever they 
want without consequences. With a 
handful of printouts and no actual 
experience in a juvenile detention 
center, I didn't know how to answer. 

A fellow organizer came to my res-
cue, explaining that the student's idea 
that prison should "reform" inmates 
through harsh treatment is an ex-
ample of "deterrence" the idea that 
if you make prison really unpleasant, 
people will be less likely to commit 
future crimes. Pointing to a handout, 
she told him that, if he looked half-
way down the page, he would see 
that statistics prove the ineffective-
ness of deterrence, especially among 
44 
juveniles. Just look: Juveniles placed 
in prison with hardened adult of-
fenders are several times more likely 
to commit crimes once released. 

Another student chimed in. He 
had heard that kids in prison have to 
join gangs, and that once you're in a 
gang, you're in it for life; that a lot 
of kids who come in for small-time 
stuff leave beholden · to some re-
ally dangerous people. While I had 
never heard of this · specific dilemma, 
based on my experience watching 
films and TV shows about prison, 
it seemed pretty plausible. One girl 
says that her cousin just got out of 
prison, where he'd been saved by the 
Lord. Now he goes to church every 
Sunday. I didn't know what to do 
with that, so I just nodded. 

All the while, . I was thinking 
that I didn't ·have the authority to 
lecture anyone let alone students 
whose friends and siblings have been 
affected by the injustice I was fight-
ing. I kept expecting someone to 
jump up and expose me as a fraud; 
''He'd never even been to Connecti-
cut before his freshman year. He's 
never even seen the inside of a prison . 
He doesn't know anyone inside. He 
has no personal stake in this at all." 

And they'd be right 
I am just 
an outsider. My confidence wavered, 
and I realized how removed I was 
from this traumatic system of in-
justice. But distanced as I may have 
seemed, I remembered being sixteen 
and sitting in a classroom like this, 
enraged by the unfairness I saw ev-
erywhere. Maybe I didn't have any 
personal stake, and maybe this whole 
"fair" thing was just my own sense of 
justice acting up. Nonetheless, it was 
why I was there. 

We spent the last fifteen min-
utes of class brainstorming a plan to 
change the current law. Any ideas? 
No? Well, I said, at Yale we've been 
calling legislators (it's really easy, 
and we'll pass out their contact in-
formation after class) and giving 
presentations to other organizations 
that might be interested in help-
ing us raise awareness. I told them 
we could start by figuring out what 
places in their communities might 
be interested in rallying around 



the issue. The students had ideas: 
James works with the NAACP, Pe-
ter thought Myspace.com could be a 
good place to advertise, Jess said. that 
her church might be interested, and 
Sylvia wasn't quite sure, but defi-
nitely wanted to help. We finished 
by passing out signup sheets asking 
them to fill in their contact informa-
tion and list things they might do for 
the campaign. 

The afternoon went more 
smoothly than I had anticipated. 
We're still in touch with the school 
and plan to· work with them in the 
future. I was relieved that no one had 
called my bluff. It was probably evi-
dent that I knew far less about things 
like prison and youth crime than 
some of the kids who had shared 
their personal stories. I like to think 
that, as transparently inexperienced 
as I may have been, the students for-
gave and encouraged me. It was a 
Friday afternoon and most of them 
were probably more concerned with 
the coming weekend. Still, I thought, 
maybe I had taught them a little about 
organizing, about social change, and 
about making a difference. Maybe I 
wasn't a total fraud after all. 

Class was dismissed. The teens 
left for their weekend, and I was left 
with my statistics, my angst, and my 
hope that things could change.-
