Cult of Domesticity 
INSIDE A SLOPPY FRESHMAN BOYS'

suite, beer bottles and vodka handles 
decorate an otherwise naked win-
dowsill, forming an alcoholic skyline. 
Selections from the Western canon.-
Dante's Inferno, Paradise Lost are 
scattered across a stained futon. Un-
identifiable pieces of clothing slump 
over the arms of two chairs. The 
January light defracts in a fishbowl 
on the table, in which a small, white 
rodent paces. 
"A mouse in the fishbowl." "A 
tadpole in the red party cup." "A 
bunny under the lofted bed." No, 
these aren't preparations for .a frat 
initiation but rather everyday sights 
for those Yalies who risk keeping 
pets on campus. Though there aren't 
many student pet-owners on campus, 
the few are the proud. 

One suite attempted to turn their 
dorm's infestation into an experiment 
in domestication. For several weeks a 
group of freshman boys kept a lone 
mouse, Whiskers of Steel, in a fish-
bowl on the common room table. The 
owners of a smuggled rabbit claim to 
have saved him from a man who had 
4 
plans to turn the tender bunny into 
an entree. Hidden beneath the ivy 
of Berkeley College rest the w·e~ry 
bones of one suite's illegal gerbil, 
Queef. "It's an unmarked grave, but 
I know he's there," said the former 
owner of the deceased. "He's like 
the unknown soldier." Queef even 
spent one spring break hidden in the 
suite's microwave 
also illicit with 
a bong (illicit) and other (illicit) 
goods. "Hiding spots are few and 
far between in these suites," said one 
of Queef's owners. However, if the 
animal is deceased, hiding is no lon-
ger necessary. Now hanging on their 
dorm wall is the head of a stuffed 
buck that, they assert, is "cool by 
undergraduate regulations." 

Yale's unpoetic pet policy leaves 
little room for interpretation. Flip to 
the section on dormitory regulations 
of the Undergraduate Regulations 
Handbook, and read, "Students are 
not permitted to keep pets in their 
dormitory rooms." 

Other schools' 
codes are less totalitarian. At Brown, 
the cool uncle of the Ivy League fam-
ily, two rules are published. One sets 
a maximum limit for the size of an 
aquarium allowed in dormitories (ten 
gallons) and another sets a minimum 
limit for the amount of time the pet 
must be able to survive under water 
(fifteen minutes). Together, the two 
rules cleverly preclude such loopholes 
as a Chihuahua living in a ten gallon 
tUb. At Wesleyan, Yale's cuckoo Con-
necticut cousin, only "uncaged pets" 
are forbidden. This rule, as flexible 
as a contort1orust, seems to permlt 
any number of sins and allow room 
for flagrant animal abuse. Reed Col-
lege, our stoner brother, also permits 
"caged anirnals," and, unsurprisingly, 
the infamously liberal campus ·goes 
a step further by designating certain 
dorms as "cat dorms," in which feli-
neophilic residents agree on one com-
munal cat for each floor. 

There is, however, one exception 
on Yale's otherwise staunch campus: 
Service animals are allowed for blind, 
deaf, and other wise physically dis-
abled students. Currently, this privi-
lege does not extend to animals aiding 
people with emotional ailments. Yet 
since a 2003 ruling by the Depart-
ment of Transportation granted privi-
leges to emotional support animals, it . 
is becoming common to hear of doc-
tors' notes insisting that patients be 
allowed to bring dogs onto airplanes, 
into restaurants, and even to spas. 

There is no telling whether the Uni-
versity might soon find itself forced to 
discriminate between pets that qualify 
as service animals and those that don't. 
Dean of Students Betty Trachtenberg, 
however, doesn't paw and whine over 
the issue. 

"To my knowledge, we 
haven't had discussions about ani-
mals and mental health issues," wrote 
Trachtenberg in an e-mail. 

Though Yalies, by and large, 
don't seem to be substituting pets for 
Prozac, there's no doubt that having a 
pet can be a comfort for stressed uni-
versity students. "College is a really 
self-centered time of life," said one 
rabbit-owner, who suggested that tak-
ing care of a pet allowed her to step 
outside of herself in a therapeutic way. 
"You're outside the network of fam-
ily and only t · 
· g of your classes, 
your grades." 


Pet-owning Yalies won't settle 
for a mere wall hanging or a collage 
of photos of old friends to make their 
home away from home a little homier. 
"The fish tank adds some color," said 
the owner of Turtle, a silver dollar

sized turtle the student caught over 
the summer while fishing with . his 
family. "It makes a more homey at-
mosphere." 

Students cannot be too choosy 
about their pets. Circumventing ani-
mal shelters' strict regulations is the 
first hurdle to clear. "I gave [the adop-
tion agency] my master's office ad-
dress and hoped they wouldn't try to 
contact me," said one former rabbit-
owner. Other students avoid sheltet s 
altogether. Craig's List introduced 
one se·nior to his furry suitemate. The 
only criterion for adoption? "Don't 
kill the fucker." 

With adoption, the travails of il-
licit pet owning have only just begun. 
Duping adoption agencies is only 
practice for eluding the ubiquitous 
staff of Yale's Custodial Services, a 
veritable cadre of informants in-
structed to report any evidence of ani-
mal life 
the sights, sounds, and, of 
course, smells 
they come across on 
their daily rounds of the residential 
colleges. "We were always pretty con-
fident that we were one step ahead of 
the authorities," said one of Queef's 
former owners. Apparently, most pet-
owning malefactors are. "I feel that 
compliance is pretty good, generally," 
said University Fire Marshall Michael 
Johns, whose team is responsible for 
conducting room inspections in all 
twelve residential colleges. 'TPets] are 
not something we come across all that 
frequently." But a pet isn't the worst 
contraband for these secret police to 
find. Said one pet owner, "I would 
rather that the master see our pet than 
that the master see our opium." 

Ah, the life of an undergradu-
ate. 

While the parents of college 
students try to experience it vicari-
ously through their children's infre-
quent phonecalls, the pets of college 
students partake of that glamorized 
lifestyle firsthand (or rather, firstpaw). 
A turtle named Spinach, like his stu-
dent owner, was a familiar commuter 
on Amtrak's regional service route. 
Without so much as taking the PSATs, 
another pet attended Yale classes via 
February 2007 
his owner's tote bag. One rambunc-
tious pet-gone-wild accumulated a 
memoir's worth of college experience 
that would put to shame the novel 
I Am Charlotte Simmons. The little 
darling partook in scientifically valu-
able (though legally questionable) 
physics projects, spent time iJ?- close-
quarters with a stash of hallucino-
genic narcotics, and traveled through 
more than thirty states as a stowaway 
on tour with a rowdy Yale a capella 
group. Guilty by association, these 
dorm pets are not complacent in a life 
of domesticity, but rather complicit 
in a life of petty crime.
