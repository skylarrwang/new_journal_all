concerned for her health, went to her OB-GYN to ask 
for Gardasil. There was scarcely enough time for two of 
the vaccine's three rounds. 

By late October, when UHS began offering Gardasil, 
it was too late for Maya to be even two-thirds protected 
for their big reunion. cci'm seeing this guy soon,'' she said. 
ccobviously it's not a guarantee, but anything to reduce 
· my chances." Her even voice took on the slightest edge. 
c~I feel a lot of risk surrounding this whole issue. I feel 
like the clock is ticking." 
s · Maya guided me through her problems, I 
discovered even more troubling news than her delay 
in obtaining Gardasil. Maya received little to no guidance 
along the way. When Maya's boyfrit:nd first told her that 
he had HPV, she was stumped. ccThe last time I learned 
about it was in the eighth grade," she recalled thinking. 
cci don't remember what HPV is, or how you can get it. I 
have no idea how this works." 

ccN o one knows what to do,'' said Maggie Doherty, a 
' 
former coordinator of the Reproductive Rights Action 
League of Yale (RALY). On the surface, she appears 
deceptively sunny. But when she spoke about sexual 
health at Yale, her tone was slightly despondent. c'I'm 
still sometimes flabbergasted. We have Peer Health 
Educators, we have all this stuff that's out there, and no 
one knows where to get a condom or what to do in an 
emergency." 

As a RALY member, Maggie has pushed UHS to 
increase transparency of the University's policies on 
emergency contraception. "Yale's sexual health policies 
are kind of odd in that they're good," she said. "They 
do good things. But because some of these things are 
controversial, Yale doesn't do a good job of getting 
word out there. People just don't know about it." To 
understand Yale's reasoning, Doherty imagined stodgy 
old alums raising a ruckus when they read about things 
like the ready availability of emergency contraceptives 
or Yale's free coverage of unlimited abortions. Heavily 
dependent on contributions from more conservative 
alumni, the University has allowed a certa-in vagueness to 
accrue around the availability of sexual health resources. 
Doherty also spoke of some women going in to ask 
for emergency contraceptives only to face doctors who 
accused them of reckless behavior. "We've been trying 
to get our hands on their policy for a long time, and 
haven't been able. Apparently doctor ~o doctor it's very 
specific," Doherty said. "Their policy isn't very coherent 
and they don't corninunicate it very effectively." The 
University's inability to provide a clear explication of its 
available resources, she suggested, has led to such well-
intentioned but questionably effective ventures as the 
Peer Health Educators' (PHE) "Connections"workshop,

The original pamphlet asked male undergraduates, "Would 
you be more careful if it was you that got pregnant?" 
better known as the "freshman sex talk." Doherty sees 
Connections as "just a bizarre sort of failure." 

Peer Health Educator Axel Schmidt, who was trained 
by UHS, explained that the workshop's top priority is 
to convey to students that most of UHS's services are 
free. Educators like Schmidt also direct students to 
other resources, like Walden, a hotline that provides 
general peer counseling. "We try to make sure they 
know [these resources] ~xist," he said. But Axel was 
the first to admit that, because so many resources exist, 
even he sometimes has "no idea which one does what." 
Moreover, he said, as they all have different contact 
information and points of access, "finding them is kind 
of difficult." After the workshop, PHEs hand out UHS 
magnets listing a few resources for quick reference. It's 
the least they can do to attack the problem. 

Maybe Maya misplaced the magnet. Maybe she never 
received it. Regardless, it's not in her room. While she 
enjoyed the PHE's Connections workshop Doherty 
had termed a "failure," Maya couldn't recall much else 
about it. "I just remember that everyone in that room 
30 
was laughing the entire time," she said. And why should 
she have paid closer attention? She felt she'd been lucky 
to receive a pretty thorough sex education in high school, 
and that Connections had merely rehashed old material. 
"I feel like I knew all of this stuff when I was taking tests 
on it," she said. ('But despite all that, no~ that I'm actually 
in the sit~ation and actually have to deal with it, I have no 
idea what to do." As a PHE, Schmidt sees this response 
far too often. "We hope the workshops aren't too 
frustratingly boring for those who know everything," he 
reasoned, ."and at least informative for those who don't." 
·so wh~t is taken in? Maya's knowledge of the services 
offered by UHS was limited. "I'm guessing you can 
get emergency contraception?" she said. "I'm not sure." 
She remembered hearing about a new rape crisis hotline 
from Connections, but wasn't sure if she could even 
get birth control pills at UHS. "I feel like I'm new at 
being an adult, and being sexually active," she explained. 
((The overwhelming feeling is kind of excited, and really 
co'nfused, about what it's like." The combination of 
sentiments she exposed anticipation, anxiety, and, above 
all, confusion made one thing clear: Maya needed more 
than a simple immunization . 

ne resource that might help students like Maya if 
only they knew about it is Sex Counseling Services, 
a program at UHS offered by the Mental Hygiene 
department. The program is little-known at Yale; its only 
mention ·on the UHS website is a two-word reference 
buried on the Mental Hygiene page. 

The office of sex counselor Dr. Philip Sarrel is tucked 
away in a quiet corner of UHS's third floor, where he can 
be found one day a week. In his seventies, he is nearing 
retirement, but the subdued quiet of his office belies the 
boisterous history of his career at Yale. After training in 
gynecology at Yale during the '60s, Sarrel joined the Air 
Force and was briefly stationed near Massachusetts's Five 
Colleges. There, he and his wife first developed the notion 
of an undergraduate course on human sexuality. With no 
credits and no grades 
really no requirements at all 
the 
unprecedented class ·was entirely for students' personal 
benefit. 

The Sarrels piloted "Topics in Human Sexuality" at 
Mt. Holyoke, Amherst, and Smith. When they debuted 
the course at Yale, Battell Chapel was the only venue 
large enough to seat the 1200 students who enrolled. In 
addition to a weekly lecture and evening film series, 
the Sarrels organized up to eighty discussion groups 
of twelve students, each led by two students, one male 
and one female, who had taken the class before. While 
"Topics" discussed what now seems like traditional sex 
ed fare 
"Contraception and Abortion" and "Pregnancy 
and Birth" 
they also included more unconventional
