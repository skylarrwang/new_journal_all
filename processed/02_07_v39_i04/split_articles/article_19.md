application, snaps a Polaroid, indicates her 
availability and modeling preferences (nude 
or clothed, undergraduate or graduate classes), 
and·she is on her way to becoming someone's 
charcoal sketch. "She'' is the correct pronoun 
.here for more than political reasons: the Art 
School's models are generally female. Male 
models, Messer tells me, are more difficult to 
acquire. "American men want only one penis 
.in the room," he says. 

Gender politics aside, The Blue Binder 
· brims with photographs of women, some 
quite old. Many, however, are young enough 
to be Yale students and some of them actu-
ally are. Though the vast majority of models 
are "casuals" 
local residents unaffiliated 
with the University the school currently 
employs several Yalies willing to defrock for 
the sake of art. At $15 dollars per hour clothed, 
$20 nude, modeling is one of the University's 
highest paying student jobs, but certainly not 
the oldest. According to Sam Messer, before 
Yale went co-ed, art students relied solely on 
outside models or drew from busts. It is dif-
ficult to pinpoint who the first nude student 
model on Yale's campus was, as even though 
women were admitted to the Art School as 
early as 1873, they were certainly not encour-
aged to pose fully nude. Considering women 
were not even admitted to Yale College until 
1969, no undergraduate women posed until at 
least the 1970s. By the 1980s, however, the job 
was advertised and feminist Naomi Wolf, who 
would later go on to publish The Beautylv!Jth, ad-
vise AI Gore, and accuse Yale Professor Har-
old Bloom of sexual assault, modeled nude as 
an undergraduate. 

It is difficult to calculate the exact num-
ber of models currently employed by the 
University, largely due to the ambiguity of 
what constitUtes employment. Though the 
Blue Binder is packed with models, few of 
them are ever called to duty. 

Aside from indicating availability and 
class preferences (an undergraduate model 
might choose not to model for introductory 
courses filled with students she passes daily 
on Cross Campus), there is little the models 
can do clothed to prepare for the day of their 
employment. The process is almost entirely 
in the hands of those who run the classes. 

Professors looking for models consult The 
Binder and contact those whose preferences 


Ies a bit reductive and more than a little 
cliche to call the models «muses" for certain 
courses, but their constancy and purpose as the 
form for student art encourages the compari-
son. Though the hiring process is largely con-
trolled by extrinsic factors, the model wields 
a surprising. amount of power once inside a 
figure drawing class. When I visit the evening 
session run by Lasley, the robed model ambles 
around the studio before the session, leisure-
ly eating Chinese take-out and insisting that 
country music is not played. At her request, a 
heater is placed next to the pillowed, draped 
platform where she will recline. A boombox 
plays Bjork. The shades are drawn. 

Though practices vary by professor and 
class, Lasley's informal evening drawing ses-
sions leave the choice of poses to the model. 
On this night, Jennifer, a tall, curvaceous «ca-
sual," asks if any of the assorted students sit-
ting at their easels have posing preferences. 
She then divides the session into a series of 
shorter warmup poses followed by two hour-
long poses intersperesed with much needed 
five minute breaks to ease her muscles. Jenni-
fer steps up to the platform, unties her waist-
band, and drops her robe. 

Far more than appearance or body-type, 
the choice of pose is the defining factor in mod-
eling skill. To pose well is an act of both literal 
and figurative balance; a model must be able 
to display creativity and aesthetic sensibility 
while remaining absolutely still. Shorter pos-
es 
generally two to five minutes 
are offered 
at the beginning of any figure drawing session 
to facilitate warm-up sketches. When the me-
dium is conducive to quick sketches, a model 
can afford to hold her arms out and lean at pre-
carious angles. To formulate. a longer pose for 
paint or inkwash, a model may have to hold 
still for up to thirty minutes. There's a thin line 
between a beautiful curve and a strained back, 
and models generally experiment with differ-
ent poses until they find the perfect combina-
tion of intriguing form and weight-distribut-
ing, neck-supporting function. 

In the evening class, Jennifer begins with 
a quick series of short standing poses. With legs shoulder-
width apart and head evenly turned, she assumes the stance 
of a nude conqueror. After two minutes, she raises one leg 
and places an arm over her head to hold an invisible para-
sol; 1 ennifer becomes a girlish figure dancing through an 
imaginary rainstorm. Through five more short poses and 
two reclining long poses, she remains motionless but for 
her eyes, which take in a room of bizarre juxtapositions: 
her discarded sandals and robe s~t next to the platform, a 
crowd of appealingly mussed artists works intently, and . 
one hapless fellow in a Hollister hoodie holding a nearly 
empty sketchbook stands nearby. Observer versus ob- · 
served, artist versus art, clothed versus naked 
once 1 en-
nifer or any model steps onto the platform, boundaries are 
drawn and roles are created. 

Nude modeling is about far more than taking off your 
clothes. When models are given the freedom to choose their 
poses, they collaborate in the process of their own artistic 
representation. For Sarah Lasley, who sometimes poses for 
her own class, the model herself both facilitates and directs 
the artistic process. Sarah recalls sessions in which she has 
occupied the · role of both supervisor and model, bustling. 
about in a robe to adjust the platform upon which she 
would soon recline, alternatively telling students, "Paper's 
over there" and asking, ccHow do you like my boobs?'' 

·The typical model, however, values her employment 
for more than a salary; on the clock, she finds an opportuni-: 
ty for self-reflection. The obvious question most people ask 
of nude models is what do they think about when holding 
still for so long, without clothes? And the answer is almost 
unanimous: themselves. Elizabeth, an undergraduate who

has modeled nude for the Art School for the past 
two years and requested her name be changed for 
this article, sees modeling as an occasion for medi-
tation, an "enforced concentration" that has taught 
her to appreciate the workings of the human body. 
ccwhen all you can do is concentrate on holding a 
certain position," she says, " you really learn things 
about your posture and balance." 

However, modeling nude is more than simple 
mechanics; it has provided Elizabeth with a new per-
spective on how she perceives her body and herself. 
Since a figure drawing session produces numerous 
portraits from just as many angles, the results reflect 
the inherently subjective nature of an image: there 
may be only one woman draped over the platform, 
but there are as many ways of perceiving her as there 
are artists in the room. 

For Elizabeth, this expe.rience has helped com-
bat negative self-image. Her first attempts at model- · 
. ing were filled with anxiety about how she looked. "I 
used to try to suck in my stomach when I first start-
ed/' she recalls. Later, she realized that "nobody's 
in a class to scout for Victoria's Secret models," and 
that few students, if any, care about a less-than-flat 
midsection. The importance lies in the body itself, 
and in realizing that art takes as subject what popu-
lar culture might classify as imperfections. "Maybe 
one guy just focuses in on the way the vertebrae in 
your neck are shaded," she says. "Or someone will 
draw you with huge hips or with a really tiny waist 
or with distorted eyes and ape-like arms." 

Artists and models seem to agree that the artistic 
method the process of drawing and being drawn-
provides both the artist with an opportunity for 
aesthetic improvement and the model with a sense 
of personal fulfillment. Aspiring artists depend on
