Good Shepherd is not the only
film to take on the mystery of
Skull and Bones. In 2000, The Skulls
defined the stereotypical Bonesman
in the character of Caleb Mandrake.
A Yale senior, Mandrake pulls his
convertible up to a riverbank to
watch a regatta and hauls himself out
of the bucket seat for a better view.
In the process, he blocks· the view of
his girlfriend, who whines: "Hey-
liiiike, I can't see the race!" Always
the
gentleman,
Mandrake huffs,
"Imagine it."
The suave, assured villain played
by hunky Paul Walker is a caricature
of the Yale Man: rich enough for that
nice car, charming enough for that
to depict a space that, while it does
exist, feels fictional
a space that is
a product of the cultural imagination,
a space that has come to symbol-
ize our fears of back-alley political
power, a space that has a deep . and
yet completely obscure history.
When the hard:-working, cre.w-
rowing, · all-around-good-boy Luke
MeN amara (0shua Jackson) first
enters the tomb depicted in The
.
Skulls, he finds himself in a very dif-
ferent space from that which appears
in The Good Shepherd. The center of
the tomb is a stark grey atrium, _with
the chilly air of a bank vault, that
Bonesmen refer · to as "The Ritual
Room." The columns are not Doric
or Corinthian but boxy Bauhaus,
hewn of light grey stone.
Inscribed into the wall of the second
level are three capital letters spelling
out the word ''WAR." The film tells
us that this inscription is the six foot
tall stone equivalent of a peppy poster
in a career services office: it is intend-
ed to prod Bonesmen to volunteer for
their country. This task, a Bonesman
and U.S. Senator explains to a bewil-
dered MeN amara, is a necessary step
on the road to political power. When
MeN amara asks the obvious ques-
tion "But what if there isn't a war to
volunteer for?" the Senator strokes
a glowing, neon-green skull and re-
plies ominously, "Son, there is always

"Mandrake he was destt.ned for the
Skulls. the day he Was b·orn," says a
soct'ety recrut'ter:, .watcht'ng ht·m at t·he
regatta through huntl.ng bt·n· oculars
But Mandrake l·s the qut'ntessentt'al
Skull not only because of his chiseled,
Nordic features, his powerful dad,
and his rotating chorus of doting gals;
he is a Skull because he delights in ob-
structing views, telling those who'd
like .to peer over his wide shoulders
to simply "imagine it."
Despite the sketch of the tomb
afforded by those break-ins, Holly-
wood has taken Mandrake's advice
to heart, "imagining" the tomb how-
ever it sees fit. For all its rumored
power, Skull and Bones has no abil- ·
ity to control its image. Though the
club is routinely depicted on such
ostensibly objective news sources as
CNN as a power-hungry, fear-mon-
gering bastion of elitism, Skull and
Bones is completely unable to sue for
libel, which would require revealing
what the tomb does contain. This
leaves set designers free to let their
imaginations run wild. Their cam-
eras can glide inside with the author-
ity of objective journalists, and walk
us through rooms that are wholly
fantastical. It's a singular challenge,


a war sometime, somewhere."
ne of these cinematic tombs was
constructed after a Bonesman
led this country into the Gulf War,
the other after his Bonesman son led
us int·o the War on Terror
a war
conducted almost entirely behind
closed doors. In their depictions of
the stronghold, both films reflect the
anxiety that national matters of life
and death are decided in secret by a
handful of powerful men.
Are these the men who encour-
age our country to go to ''WAR?"
The beginnings of wars are often
obscured from the populace. Only
after a Supreme Court battle were
newspapers able to publish sections
of the seven thousand pages of The
Pentagon Papers elucidating the ori-
gins of the Vietnam War~ More re-
cently, Mark Danner's investigation
of the commencement of the war in
Iraq, published under the title The
Secret Way to War, highlighted the
military planning that began as early·
as November, 2001, before inspec-
tors could confirm the existence of
weapons of mass destruction. The
war-room of the White House, like
a secret society, is a place obscured
to the public until the adventurous
few break in.
In both The Skulls and The Good
Shepherd, Skull and Bones repre-
sents this lacuna in our national self-
knowledge, an all-important place
that is perpetually hidden. Within
these walls, war resembles the induc-
tion rituals MeN amara must endure
to enter the "Ritual Room"
just
another frat-boy initiation on the
path to power.


impler than any other fa~ade fac-
ing High Street, Skull and Bones'
tomb is almost inviting car:ved of
rosy stone, worn soft at the edges,
with slit windows that peer sadly
at 0 ld Campus. There are no overt
markings suggesting that the tomb
is anything .other than a building
that sometimes people go out of and
sometimes people go in.

But there's something here that
stirs our desire to enter. Look closer
at the society's official logo in-
scribed on intra-society memos- -
and there seems to be something
lurking in the dark sockets. The lo-
go's artist has taken care to show us
that something is back there, lurk-
ing just beyond. The two hollows,
like the tomb's guarded windows,
are obscured portals hinting at an
interior that they simultaneously
refuse to reveal.

In The Skulls, the Bonesmen
monitor their tomb on closed -circuit
camera. But when our hero proudly
takes the tape to the police station at
the film's end offering seemingly
foolproof evidence of a murder Man-
drake committed in the tomb there
isn't anything to see. The screen is
all static and fuzz. "There must be
something wrong," he pleads, flail-
ing his arms wildly. "It was all here!
It was all on film!"

In the end, film fails us. The best
we can do is as the murderer recom-
mended: "Imagine."
