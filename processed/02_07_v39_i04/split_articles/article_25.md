subjects like "Sex as a Medium of 
Exchange." What ''Topics" students 
were seeking and what the Sarrels 
attempted to offer was rote biology 
as it applied to human relationships; 
facts as they applied to feelings. On 
the cover of their book above an 
abstract design of a flower in bloom, 
is the title: Sexual Unfolding. It is, 
they write, the "process ... by which 
some young people form that aspect 
of their identity we call the sexual." 
The course ran for 28 years. 
Sarrel attributed the advent of 
"Topics" and the Sex Counseling 
Service to the cultural atmosphere of 
the early '70s. In Connecticut, laws 
that made contraception _ illegal and 
banned sex on Sundays were finally 
revoked by the state legislature. "It 
was very much a 'spirit of the times' 
thing," he explained. 

This is not to say that the program 
wasn't wildly controversial. Under 
the Sarrels' 
guidance, 
a 
group 
of students (boldly named the 
"Committee on Human Sexuality") 
were soon inspired to write an 
informational pamphlet for 
the 
student body. Titled" Sex and the Yale 
Student," the 64-page book outlined 
everything from the condom-on-
a-banana basics of sex-ed to a 
comprehensive guide of Yale's sexual 
health resources, with- instructions 
on what to do and where to turn 
in every foreseeable circumstance. 
"Sex and the Yale Student" was such 
a success that even former Yale 
President Kingman Brewster proudly 
February 2007 
kept copies stacked on a table in his 
Hillhouse home. Just past the first 
page's delightful inscription 
"We 
all get by with a little help from our 
friends ... " 
the pamphle~ contained 
a passage declaring that _its readers 
were "privileged in that you have 
access to information that some 
would... have given their lives for 
in previous times." The authors 
probably thought easy access to 
this information was assured for all 
future students. 

Sadly, this was not the case. The last 
edition of "Sex and the Yale Student" 
(later simply "Sex at Yale") was 
printed around 1996, the last year the 
Sarrels taught "Topics" before taking 
a joint sabbatical. "There was a sense 
that the society was picking up the 
role we played," Sarrel remembered. 
"Now I have some other thoughts 
about it." When they had gone, the 
program floundered. The money 
to produce the pamphlet, formerly 
. freely distributed to every incoming 
freshman thanks to a five-dollar fee 
collected from "Topics" attendees, 
was now nowhere to be found. 
Sarrelloves the idea of resurrecting 
the Yale-specific pamphlet, and even 
received preliminary approval for a 
new, online version from UHS. Its 
reintroduction, 
however, 
would 
require the help of a corrunitted 
group of students. "Remember," he 
says, "all the power behind this [was 
because] Yale responded to the voice 
of its students. It may not seem that 
way, butifstudentswantsomething ... '' 

n Halloween, I was set to meet 
with Maya one last time, but I 
felt like I had nothing left to offer her. 
I'd spent the end of October on the_ 
phone, calling around New Haven 
for clinics that might be able to give 
her at least one dose of Gardasil 
before 
Thanksgiving 
break less 
than a month away 
but to little avail. 
The vaccine at last became available 
at UHS on Monday, October 30th. 
There was no fanfare when it hnally 
appeared. And contrary to my 
gynecologist's assurances, I wouldn't 
have heard about its availability at all 
if I hadn't pestered Immunizations 
to keep me on a call-list for those 
awaiting the vaccine . 

For Maya, though, immunization 
seemed practically beside the · point. 
She kept mentioning "mixed feelings" 
and "anxiety," and her smiles seemed 
forced. I'd known there wasn't a 
strict commitment, that she'd been 
vaguely seeing other people, that he 
wasn't her boyfriend per se. "I don't 
want to let him down, but it's a lot 
of pressure," she said. In a situation 
fraught with many pressures, I 
thought the pressure of navigating 
Yale's buried sexual health resources 
shouldn't have to be one of them. 

Once, Dr. Sarrel told me of a 
doctor he met at a clinic in Stockholm, 
where 
sex 
education 
starts 
in 
kindergarten. He had remarked to 
her how much more advanced her 
country's approach to sex education 
seemed to be. He didn't think he'd 
ever see that in the U.S., at least not 
in his lifetime. 

"People waste so much time on 
sex," she told him. "If they knew 
what sex was all about, they could 
spend all that energy on something 
else."
