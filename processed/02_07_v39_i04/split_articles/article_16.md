IN THE INTEREST OF ERADICATING 
landmines from the face of the planet, 
Yale paid for two chocolate fountains. 
As an attendee at the recent Speed 
Dating for Charity event, I, on the 
other hand, paid with my dignity. 

More than three-hundred sin-
gles, enticed by the tagline "Give 
Some, Get Some," donated five dol-
lars for landmine removal but seemed 
anxious to get their money's worth in 
love. We mingled in the Davenport 
Common Room, which had been 
transformed by $1800 worth of sub-
sidized, Costco-purchased brownies 
and punch, then we shuffled into the 
Dining Hall. Bewildered girls tried 
to look relaxed and drunk guys tried 
to look sober as we sat at row after 
row of red clothed tables littered 
with candy and suggested conversa-
• t1on starters. 

But to the high-mi~ded altru-
ists among us, this money-for-dates 
proposition just seemed so crass. 
Weren't we there to help uproot 
landmines across the globe? 
The 
promised exchange seemed closer to 
roughly one dignitile · let's say, the 
amount of dignity you spend trying 
to prove to a complete stranger that 
you have any personality at all for 
x amount of Afghan limbs kept safe 
from Soviet-era landmines.
