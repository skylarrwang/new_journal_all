**Title: How Hollywood Imagines Yale's Most Secret Space**
**Author: Adriane Quinlan**
**Page number(s): 20-21**

arly in The Good Shepherd, Yale man Edward Bell Wilson is 
granted access to the tomb of the secret society Skull and Bones. 
It is here that Wilson, portrayed by sensitive heartthrob Matt Da-
. mon, first enters a world of secrecy and deception in Robert DeNiro's 
recent espionage drama. But Art Director Jeannine Oppewall who 
garnered the production's sole Academy Award nomination 
has ex-
changed the frumpy brownstone on High Street for something a little 
more va-va-voom: Damon pushes through immense oxidized copper 
doors and enters a fortress of cold white granite that resembles the fa-
~ade of a courthouse. 

Perhaps we shouldn't expect accuracy from a movie that shows 
women studying in the Yale library in 1939 (a full thirty years before 
co-eds first marched in) and casts Angelina J olie as your tandard, 
glum housewife. But unlike many of Hollywood's historical flubs, the 
inaccuracies Oppewall makes in portraying the tomb are indicative of 
deeper cultural beliefs about what is hidden here, in the American 
icon of secrecy . 

The interior of Oppewall's Skull and Bones is even more far-
fetched than its exterior. Inside, Wilson finds a neo-cla_ssical foyer 
reminiscent of the Capitol rotunda. Veiny marble columns the color 
of money stretch from floor to ceiling. Buttery candlelight skims 
the shoulders of Wilson's wide-lapel suit, landing on marble floors 
that look like they have been doused in olive oil and scrubbed with a 
toothbrush. Combining the flickering candlelight of gothic academia 
with the cool, glazed marbl~ of government halls, the tomb is a mash-
up of cartoony cliches of power. Here, the bright sounds of boot heels · 

clacking across the marble floor de-
clare that these are men on a mis-
sion with places to go. This is a site 
where important things happen, but 
happen in secret. 

When Wilson graduates to join 
the O.S.S., the intelligence agency 
that will later evolve into the C.I.A., 
he finds himself in rooms like these, 
pacing halls of the same polished 
marble. We share Wilson's feeling 
that his life has been lined up before 
him as a long series of endless halls 
and · imposing rooms, beginning 
with that tomb on High Street. 

Edward Bell Wilson is the Hol-
lywood amalgam of two actual Yale 
graduates who became CIA opera-
tives in the agency's early days. But 
neither of them was a Bonesman: 
James Angleton, a brilliant spy but 
poor student from the Midwest, 
would never have qualified, and Dick 
Bissell was one of the rare few who

turned down his tap. Bissell was from 
a Bones family, but he resented how 
his older brother never discussed his 
involvement, keeping the .tomb's se-
crets ccuntil his death." Bissell opely 
declared the society cc counterpro-
ductive to true education." 

Yet the filmmakers turn these 
masters of government intelligence 
into Bonesmen, allying the secrecy 
within the tomb with the secrecy 
within the government. Released 
in the wake of the Patriot Act, the 
Plame affair, and NSA wire-tap-
pings (brought about by the secret 
executive order of a Bonesman), The 
Good Shepherd reflects our culture's 
fear of secrecy in the government. 

Here, in the darkness of a tomb 
we'll never enter, the set designer 
ties the loose threads of conspiracy 
theories into a damning knot. The 
tomb is the physical embodiment of 
our collective fears. 

he tomb onscreen is far from 
what we know of the tomb on 
High Street. What little we do know 
is courtesy of the foolhardy few 
who ·have broken in, and it barely 
resembles the version depicted in 
The Good Shepherd. The most com-
plete schematic comes from the first 
group to enter. In 1877, a group call-
ing itself the "Order of the File and 
Claw" filed the bars on the rear base-
ment window before clawing them 
out, climbing inside, pilfering the 
tomb, and writing up an expository 
pamphlet that included floor plans 
and a description of a stronghold 
with the air of a ccpleasant, convivial 
dub" where "men may enjoy good 
suppers and quiet whist." 

The next break-in came a century 
later, in 1979, when a Bonesman pro-
testing the society's unisex policy led 
a group of gutsy co-eds indoors. In a 
campus magazine, one girl described 
a room "like Miss Havisham's shrine," 
in "kind of a shambles." The tomb, 
she said, "looked like a boy's dorm 
room ... like it hadn't been cleaned in 
six months." And from the anony-
mous accounts of ex-Bonesmen, re-
porter Alexandra Robbins portrayed 
the tomb as a "Victorian living room." 
News stories most often picture it as 
a glorified frat house. 

The summary vision of these 
accounts informs us that the tail 
of the tomb's "T" shape contains 
a long, high-ceilinged back din-
ing room, while the rectangle fac-
ing High Street contains a basement 
with a mu.sty kitchen and storage 
rooms. Above the basement level is a 
two-story mini-manse that includes 
a cozy, book-lined living room and 
a few bedrooms, convenient resting
