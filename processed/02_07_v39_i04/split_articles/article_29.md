''We · worked with people in at-risk
facilities, figuring who gets in and
out and with what," Highsmith de-
scribes. "We now are at a constant
level of preparation. If the govern-
ment raises its threat assessment, we
review what that means for us and
adapt our procedures as necessary."
Faced with the daunting responsibil-
ity of safeguarding roughly 12,000
students and faculty as well as mul-
tibillion dollar assets, Highsmith
makes no concessions about the
current state of world affairs. "The
world has become a more dangerous
place since 9/11," she posits, "But do
I think Yale has become a safer place
since then? I do. We have not elimi-
nated crime nobody has but bur-
glaries are down, violence is down,

1s more secure.
If a· terrorist attack had oc-
curred at the November concert, the
Office of Risk Management would
have processed the claim and direct-
ed it toward the federal government
for consideration under the Terror-
ism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA). The
law, signed by President Bush in
November of 2002 and extended in
~ ,
2005, allows the Treasury to defray
90% of the cost of any damage done
to private property by a "Certified
Act of Terrorism." Due for review
by December 31st of this year, TRIA
is intended to supplement the in-
sufficient capacity of private com-
panies to cover damages incurred
by large-scale acts of terrorism. In
order to be "certi:fi ed," the incident
must have been intended to harm
40
human life, infrastructure, or prop-
erty, and must be carried out by or
in the name of foreign interests for
the express purpose of alte~ing gov-
ernmental policy through coercion
or violence against civilians.

Just how massive, then, must
these strikes be in order to secure
government aid? s<? massive that
the bombing at the Yale Law School,
which scorched a ceiling, demolished
a wall separating two classrooms,
and crushed the cabinets of the
alumni reading room, thus sending
rubble and debris tumbling d-own a
stairwell into an open portion of the
library, did not qualify for TRIA aid.
"We paid for the damage through our
regular insurance channels," relates
Marjorie Lemmon, the University's
Risk Manager. · "The explosion was
deemed an act of vandalism."

So what does warrant the title
of terrorism? If the federal govern-
ment recognizes only certain acts,
how are we to define or prepare for
future acts of violence?

Several months after the con-
cert, I called the New Haven branch
of the FBI to inquire . into the bu-
reau's stance on the local threat of
terrorism. How likely were vre ,t~ get
hit? And what could I
an Elm City
citizen do to stop it? I had found
the number of the office's Media
Representative, Speci~l Agent Victo-
ria Woods, on the branch's webpage.
After a couple of suspenseful rings, a
pinched female voice int.onecJ on the

other end. "New Haven FBI. How

my interest, I was placed on hold,
and, some thirty seconds later, con-
nected to the press office. I reached
an answering machine which gave
me another number, which led to
another answering machine: "Thank
you for calling the pre~s ~~fie~ of the
New Haven FBI. We are not here to
take your call right now. Please leave
your message and we'll respond · to
your inquiry as soon as possible."

I wanted to talk to the FBI
about my apocalyptic visions that
Yale would be blown up. After all,
we had educated the President so
