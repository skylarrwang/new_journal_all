SENDING ONE'S BABY OFF TO COL-
LEGE has always been a nerve-wrack-
ing step. Think of everything that 
could go wrong: inedible cafeteria 
food, debilitating homesickness, a 
messy rootrunate. Or worse: freak ice 
storms, meningitis outbreaks, drug 
overdoses. This past summer, a let-
ter from Dean Peter Salovey to Yale 
families added a new and terrifying 
possibility to the already extensive 
list of disaster scenarios: the H5N1 
virus, commonly known as Avian Flu. 
Parents who tensed up while reading 
the letter can exhale: Yale has a com-
prehensive plan. For neurotic parents, 
Yale has a network of offices devoted 
~ 
to thinking up solutions to all the 
gruesome accidents that may befall 
students. 

Yale's Office of Risk Management 
likes to think of itself as the "go-to" 
agency for all calamities. Its title evokes 
images of high-strung politicos perched 
on the edge of their seats, watching for 
the tiniest blip on the radar. In truth, is 
that the office is run by the same kind 
of obsessive organizers who run the 
rest of Yale. 

Located on the fourth floor of 55 
Whitney Avenue, a corporate building 
like any other, the headquarters holds 
a staff of six, directed by Marjorie 
Lemmon. Their task, Lenunon says, 
is simply "to imagine all bad things 
that could happen.'' 

_ The recentÂ· request of a group 
organizing a fashion show was typi-
cal: students sought the assistance 
of Risk Management out of concern 
for the members who would be stag-
ing clunky equipment. According to 
Lemmon, ever-present questions on 
the mind of every employee as he 
works are, "Are we covered if this 
happens? Where are the holes in our 
plan?" 

To brainstorm, employees scour 
the Yale Daily News, searching for 
the potentially dangerous details most 
of us overlook. One employee con-
centrates exclusively on driver safety 
awareness. The Office of Risk Man-
agement is the institutional equivalent 
of a fussy parent telling you to pack 
an umbrella if it looks like rain. If the 
University's duty is to serve in loco 
parentis, the fourth floor of 55 Whit-
ney is a parent-packed PTA meeting. 

Across campus at the Office of 
the Secretary, Deputy Secretary Mar-
tha Highsmith supervises the Uni-
versity's "emergency preparedness 
efforts," overseeing a general all-haz-
ards contingency plan and a specific 
plan to cope with the possibility of 
an outbreak of avian flu. 

About a year ago, Yale was 
compelled to re-evaluate its so-called 
safety net. Reports from Southeast 
Asia of a growing number of human 
cases of HSN1 incited a media mael-
strom. Public health officials were es-
pecially disturbed by the 50% mor-
tality rate of those infected. Graphic 
comparisons to the 1918 Spanish 
Influenza pandemic circulated to 
remind Americans of what was pos-
sible. If avian flu struck, it would af-
fect every conceivable facet of cam-
pus life. 

Highsmith explains that avian 
flu presents challenges that demand 
a tailored plan. "In a pandemic," she 
says, "the resources we're normal-
ly able to call upon can't be used." 
Though the national media has long 
since moved on to other sensational
