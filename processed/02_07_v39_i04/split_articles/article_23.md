t was September a month before I ever met Maya.-
and I was naked in a room of strangers, lying de-robed 
on a cold examining table in a cold room on the sterile 
. 
second floor of Yale University Health Services. My 
feet were lodged in stirrups attached to either side of the ex-
amining table, my legs were spread indecently wide, and my 
vagina had been pried open by a large plastic beak-looking 
instrument. Stationed somewhere in the midst of it all was a 
balding man in a white coat exhorting me to "just relax" so 
he could scrape and swab my unsuspecting cervix. 

When the spreading and prying came to a merciful end, 
I clothed and composed myself and remembered why I 
subjected myself to this in the first place. I had come to ask 
about Gardasil, the new vaccine against human papillomavirus 
(HPV). A while before, my mother had for warded me a bit 
of online news: ''Test shows vaccine prevents cervical cancer/' 
the headline had cheered. 

So when I gripped the sides of the examining table and 
asked my gynecologist for the shot, I was startled by his _ 
response. The vaccine, he said somewhat apologetically, was 
not yet available at University Health Services. UHS first 
needed to devise a system to accommodate the many women 
at Yale. When it was ready, he promised, I'd be sure to hear. 

I decided to trust the doctor: After all, a survey by Trojan 
Brand Condoms in the fall placed Yale at the top of a list of 
one hundred universities in terms of sexual health resources 
(Harvard came in 43rd). But while UHS has now

the real possibility. -
The truth is, many people with HPV don't even 
know that they have it. But widespread screening 
in the last forty years with annual Pap smears like 
the one I had enjoyed has knocked cervical cancer 
down from its former spot as the number one cause 
of cancer deaths in American women to a distant 
number two. For four decades, this seemed to be as 
good as it would get. Then it got better. 

In the fall of 2005, Merck announced that it had 
developed a hundred percent effective vaccine to 
prevent two particular strains of HPV associated -, 
with cervical cancer in women. By June, the FDA 
had issued a rapid approval of the vaccine, called 
Gardasil. "There have only been a few times in my 
life as a physician when I've been able to say (at least 
to myself), 'This is truly big news,'" a doctor told 
the New York Times. Female lawmakers on both 
sides of the aisle in the Michigan state legislature 
were even inspired to band together, their common 
womanhood trumping petty partisanship, in support 
of a bill mandating the vaccine for sixth-grade girls. 

If it was such big news, then why did I have 
so much trouble securing doses of the vaccine in 
September, three months after it was approved by 
the FDA? 

made Gardasil available, it wasn't until two months 
after my start-of-school Pap smear. Even though 
Trojan's "Sexual Health Report Card"-got it mostly 
right 
acknowledging real strides like free STD 
testing, contraception availability, sexual assault 
services, and various outreach programs 
as I 
learned more about sexual health at Yale, I found 
that there are still major gaps in the system. And 
these gaps may be putting students at unnecessary 
risk. 

'' 
feel like the clock is ticking,'' Maya told me. 
She is a freshman, but not in the way I was a 
freshman 
glum, moody, stubbornly maladjusted. It was 
only October when I met Maya (a pseudonym), and she was 
already eminently adjusted. She would spend a lot of time 
just sitting a~ound talking with her suitemates about how 
happy they all were at Yale. But when her suitemates started 
coming home, she ushered me from the conunon room into 
the privacy of her bedroom. She could talk with them about 
most things 
just not, I supposed, about this. 

ater that same month I asked a friend whether 
...... she had considered getting the vaccine. She 
did not even know what HPV even was 
an early 
indication, I should have realized, Yale women are 
not receiving the sexual health info they need. I 
explained that HPV is the most conunon sexually 
transmitted disease in the U.S., that between fifty 
and seventy percent of us will contract it at some 
point in our lives, and that although in most cases 
it will clear undetected, in a third of cases it causes 
genital warts, and in 9,700 American women each 
year it turns into cervical cancer. Her brow knit. 
"Do I have it?" my friend joked, half mortified at


Maya like many freshmen 
had been looking fox ward 
to starting college single. She had altnost made it, too, 
before fate intervened: Mere months away from a swingin' 
single freshman year, Maya met someone. She described an 
almost old-fashioned courtship, conducted through modern 
technology. "The entire relationship consisted of sharing and 
talking," she explained, describing their long instant messenger 
conversations. "We learned a lot about each other." 

She learned, for instance, that he has HPV and occasionally 
suffers from flare-ups of genital warts. The two had not slept 
with each other over the sununer, but she told me of her hopes 
for Thanksgiving break: She was considering taking the Next 
Step. With just two months left until Thanksgiving, Maya,
