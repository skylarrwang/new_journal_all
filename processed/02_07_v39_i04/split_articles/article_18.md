**Title: Yale students derobe for the sake of art**
**Author: Jordan Jacks**
**Page number(s): 14-15**

Sam Messer, the Associate Dean of the Yale Art 
School, is a quotable man who favors black 
sweaters and chic eyeglasses and has an im-
peccably shaved head. He peppers his speech with 
references to art theory, waves his arms energetically 
when talking of art's "creation .of a visual language," 
and, peering through his black frames, says that he 
could pay me quite a bit of money to take off my 
clothes. Since the subject at hand is nude modeling, 
his offer is perfectly appropriate. 

The power of persuasion seems to be a requisite 
trait for anyone walking th~ halls of 1156 Chapel Street. 
An atmosphere of import and meaning pervades: 
well-shod twenty-somethings with charcoal-stained 
hands shuffle past doors that open into rooms filled 
with half-painted canvases and empty easels. Even the 
most reptilian accountant would want to paint, or be 
painted, after ten minutes in the Yale Art School. For 
a second I consider taking Messer up on his offer be-
fore realizing that I would be literally inhabiting one

front of a crowd of strangers, entirely naked. 

Fortunately for the University, the majority 
of applicants for model positions are not nervous 
prudes entranced by their first encounters with 
the art world. A quick perusal of the massive, over-

Polaroid of every hired model reveals an extraordi-
narily varied bunch: black, white, Asian, male, female, 
burly, lithe, hairy, sleek, beautiful, and often stun-
ningly ordinary. Pasted on many of the applications 
are sticky notes with comments scrawled by the art 
professors on the model's performance. One model 
has fantastic poses, another talks too much, and one 
is generally aloof and brings strange visitors. It is a 
veritable Domesday Book of evaluated nudity, and 
one that I am allowed to see only because of a care-
less attendant. After only a few educational minutes, 
it's snapped frorn my hands. 

Despite The Blue Binder's aura of secrecy, ap-
plying to model at Yale Art is a straightforward pro-
cess. Easy, even: A potential applicant fills out an
