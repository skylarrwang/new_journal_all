Yale as a target for terrorists. 
by Ben Lasman 
February 2007 
utside the heavy double-doors of the Ezra Stiles dining 
hall, a group of students stood with their arms crossed 
in weak impersonations of bouncers. The staff at last 
November's Girltalk concert stamped hands, collected 
donations for the Neighborhood Music School, and tried to turn 
away hordes of intoxicated Yalies from the overcrowded event, but 
with a shrugging concession from the hired policeman, finally gave 
in and granted access to the surging crowd. 

Though a staff member myself, I could hardly feign confidence 
as I faced the rising tide of staggering, half-drunk students. Despite 
my calm demeanor and authoritative, wide-legged stance, I could 
envision nothing but disaster everywhere I looked. What if the salad 
bar and microwave tucked into a darkened corner suddenly burst 
into flames, spraying molten debris and crisped produce onto the 
packed audience? The students entering Stiles seemed less like my 
fellow classmates than lambs to the slaughter potential corpses 
whose remains I would have to catalog. Why, in the midst of such a 
thriving event, was I possessed by such a paralyzing sense of dread? 
I had purchased the insurance. I was the unlucky volunteer 
who had bought a coverage package through Yale University's Of-
fice of Risk Management. Created to address, among other concerns, 


the loss or damage of personal prop-
erty, the office subcontracts policies 
for campus events through the U r-
mia Insurance Company. U rmia's 
website shows cheerful photographs 
of trim motivational speakers and 
children playing soccer to encour-
age one to buy coverage for any-
thing from a debutante ball to a box-
ing match with an easy credit card 
payment. Should some ·over-eager 
grinding lead to serious injury on 
the dance floor, or should a fire sud-
denly ignite onstage, we would be 
covered: The event was insured for 
over a million dollars' worth of dam-
ages. All of the liabilities covered in 
the insurance document were specif-
ically enumerated, save one striking 
exception: Terrorism Risk Insurance 
Act (TRIA). Instead of specifying a 
payment limit, the column offered 
an ominous summary: "Included." 

As the evening wound down 
and sweaty concert-goers streamed 
toward the exits, the other staff 
members smiled and congratulated 
each other on a job well done. As my 
peers celebrated, I sighed with relief 
knowing that no one had suffered any 
injuries to speak of except, perhaps, 
those in the front row, whom Girl-
talk, a.k.a. Greg Gillis, had doused 
with beer. Although I was proud of 
the work we had done, as the rest of 
the crew packed up and disappeared 
into the night I wondered what would 
have happened if the policy's final 
clause had come into play. While no 
one shrank from the responsibility of 
keeping excited freshmen off stacked 
tables, how could the staff have countered an armed posse of political dissi-
dents or defused a time bomb wired to the audio-visual equipment? I suppose 
my fears of a terrorist attack at a Girltalk concert seemed paranoid and absurd. 
But having paid several hundred dollars to defray the potential cost of pre-
cisely such an occurrence, I had a vivid sense of how close disaster was. After 
a night as risk-assessor, I had lost my easy sense of security at Yale. 

s farfetched as my premonitions of bedlam might seem, they were not 
entirely unfounded. Over the past four decades, four bombs have ex-
ploded at Yale. In 1971, at the height of the New Haven trials of Black Pan-
thers Bobby Seale and Ericka Huggins, two devices detonated in the base-
ment of the Ingalls Ice Rink. No one was harmed, and the perpetrators were 
never identified. ''In the 1960s and 70s there was some terrorism directed at 
universities," explains History Professor Beverly Gage. "A lot of national 
groups criticized the institutions for colluding with the government and the 
military." Indeed, during the Seale trial, Black Panthers stayed in Yale dormi-
tories and protested with students against the ongoing prosecution. Incensed 
by the "war" they believed the FBI was waging against radical groups like the 
Black Panthers and the Weathermen, Yalies clashed with the police and the 
National Guard in the name of intellectual and ideological fr~edom. Against 
the backdrop of the Vietnam War, American universities were symbols of 
both institutional oppression and individual expression. The two bombs at 
the hockey rink were aimed not at the students, but at the Institution. 

Two decades years later, Ted Kaczynski saw Yale as an institutional 
Moloch, a symbol of capitalist society's descent into technological depen-
dency and environmental degredation. In 1993, the U nabomber mailed an 
explosive device to the Watson Hall office of Computer Science Professor 
David Gerlernter. Although Gerlernter was not killed by the blast, he sus-
tained permanent damage to his eye and hand. Kaczynski, who was appre-
hended three years later in Montana, is currently serving a life sentence for 
this and for other bombings . 


Most recently, on May 21st, 2003, 
at 4:38 p.m., an explosion rocked the 
library of the Yale Law School in the 
middle of its exam week, only days 
before Commencement, and one 
day after President Bush had raised 
the nation's threat level to "Orange." 
Though the bomb caused no injuries, 
it destroyed several rare books and 
prompted an eight-day investigation 
by the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task 
Force. On May 30th, the Law School 
reopened with an official statement 
that the occurrence did not "indicate 
or hear the marks of an international 
terrorist incident." The bombing re-
mains unsolved. 

It also stands largely forgotten. 
When discussing the incident with 
current students, the few who do 
recall the explosion have only vague 
recollections of reading about it in 
the news. The blast occurred at a 
time when most undergraduates had 
already left for summer vacation. 
Still, it seems troublesome that at a 
place as historically-literate as Yale, 
the Law School bombing has nearly 
vanished into obscurity and apathy. 
To unravel the mystery enshrouding 
the 2003 explosion, we must ask the 
question: What does Yale represent 
to terrorists in the 21st century? 

"You can never anticipate what 
will happen or when," suggests Mar-
tha Highsmith, Deputy Secretary 
and Director of Security programs 
at the University. Her staff moni-
tors campus alarms, oversees the 
construction of new buildings, and 
communicates with federal agencies 
such as the FBI and the Secret Ser-
vice to remain abreast of any poten-
tial threats. 

ccAfter 9/11, we conducted a 
comprehensive review of all facilities 
that might pose a potential threat to 
the larger community," she explains, 
"places like labs with hazardous ma-
terials." After this review, the Office 
of the Secretary installed the now-
ubiquitous electronic ID readers on 
doors and gates across the U niver-
sity and revised its emergency plans.
