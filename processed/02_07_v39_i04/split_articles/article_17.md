EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Afghan limbs and Soviet land-
mines were conspicuously absent 
from the website for "Charity Speed-
Dating@ Yale." It was jarringly pink 
and adorned with images of stuffed 
horses kissing 
the event's logo. I 
wasn't sure if I was supposed to re-
• 
semble a kissing horse, which seemed 
like an inauspicious beginning, or 
if they were supposed to represent 
third-worlders rejoicing to be free of 
landmines, which struck me as kind of 
unfair. After I passed the horses, I was 
prompted to describe myself in five 
adjectives. Apparently, I'm a Friendly 
Liberal Intellectual Idealist (After all, I 
do go to Yale and I was saving human 
lives), and since I was basically lying 
already, I threw in Attractive as well. 
What was I interested in? Like any 
honest gay man, I picked "really really 
really ridiculously good looking" and 
left it at that. 

When I arrived at the actual event, 
however, there weren't enough gay 
men signed up to segregate us into a 
"really really really ridiculously good 
looking" table and a "people with 
personalities" table. 
Which is just 
as well, I thought, since I wouldn't 
want to find out at which table I'd be 
placed anyway. What we twelve re-
ceived at the double chocolate foun-
tained speed-dating night at the gay 
Ivy, was a single half-sized, kids' table 
sheeted in a gray tablecloth. The gray 
color, different from all other tables 
decked in red warned unwary chicks 
that, no, this wasn't a dream,all these 
sensitive men did indeed watch Proj-
ect Runway. 

The emcee, a Y alie, doubled as a 
raffle-caller, offering several hundred 
dollars, worth of prizes (for us, not 
the landmine victims). He ended the 
excruciatingly long period of off-the-
clock socializing by thanking us for 
coming to speed-date and commend-
ing our desire to eliminate the scourge 
of landmines. "We wanted to do a 
charity event/, Yale,s Ivy Corps rep-
resentative and the night's organizer 
told me, "that was also a social event.,, 

Those who came to the Davenport 
February 2007 
. . 
dining hall represented only a small 
part of a larger confederation of love-
less academic do-gooders · a similar 
event took place on the campuses of 
every Ivy League college yvith a heart 
and a social life. (Harvard declined to 
. participate.) 

As my first speed-date began, 
a pang of anxiety struck me: I had 
nothing interesting to say. Why, I 
asked myself, was I here? I en vi-
sioned Croatian goatherds frolicking 
.through the grassy fields of Pannonia, 
and I said to myself, "you selfish idi-
ot, there could be landmines in those 
fields: start speed dating and shed 
some dignity!" So I got to work. 

Dignity, it turned out, was easy 
to shed. The Yale gay community is 
insular and incestuous enough that I 
was only one or two degrees of sepa-
ration removed from two thirds of 
the boys sitting near me: I'd broken 
up with one of them about a month 
before, and the next boy over had re-
jected me earlier in the semester. So 
those dates were easy, dignity loss-
wise. I ironically asked, "Do I know 
you?" and laughed at my own joke, 
and spent the next two minutes and 
fifty seconds praying that time would 
accelerate. Then there were the two 
guys that my friend and I already had 
slightly naughty nicknames for, and 
then there was my friend, then his ex-
boyfriend,s ex, then my ex,s ex. So 
that made seven dates with a base-
line level of awkwardness that, if my 
calculations were correct, probably 
saved a few dozen Bosnians from ill-
fated explosive stumbles. 

· 
The inescapable irony of the 
whole event was that, in the real 
world, where I understand that peo-
ple actually go on dates, speed -dating 
has found its niche as an altet native to 
a whole evening of one-on-one awk-
wardness. But at Yale, where dating 
comes in a distant third to random 
Beta hookups and library sleepovers 
as a popular preamble to relation-
ships, speed-dating seems to be the 
closest to old-fashioned dating that 
most Elis have ever experienced. Wit-
ness, for instance~ my female friend's 
speed-date with a football player who 
brought not one but three beers to 
carry him through less than an hour 
of 'dating. Or another,s speed-date 
with a fellow who could bar~ly utter 
more than a handful of words during 
the requisite three minutes. You'd 
think the generation brought up on 
Seinfeld, Sex and the City, and even 
Doug would have more sensitivity 
to the complex kabuki of structured 
romance. But this toe-dip into the 
world of face-to-face, exchange-of-
information mating rituals proved 
as perilous as a jaunt thro1:1gh an un-
cleared Mozambican battleground. 

Still, I'd be lying if I said I didn,t 
enjoy it. Yale may have tossed dating 
· of the ice cream social variety onto 
the Sustainable Trash Heap, but even 
this pale hint of that lost age awak-
ened a little conservative nostalgia in 
me. Once i ducked past those few so-
cial landmines, there was something 
refreshingly honest and direct about 
talking to someone with a shared 
awareness that we were evaluating 
each other as potential. .. well, dates. 

And everyone came away from 
the event with something. The land-
mine victims got a neat $1700, Yale 
got stuck with the bill for the food, 
and somewhere among the evening,s 
terrifying moments~ I managed to 
score a date with a cute guy. I would 
almost say· it felt better than spending 
those five bucks on world peace, but 
I'm a Friendly Liberal Intellectual 
Idealist. I care too much for that.
