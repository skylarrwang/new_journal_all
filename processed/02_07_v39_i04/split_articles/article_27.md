EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
last semester, on a Tuesday night during reading
week, while most undergrads were partying or
attempting to write papers, a village was erected
in one hour at th~ Yale Divinity School. Like a white
beacons of architectural altruism, the ephemeral village
shone in the night as the hymns of the Advent service
were chanted around a campfire. The five Global Vil-
lage Shelters were each assembled in a matter of min-
utes by a team of four students. Five paper laminate
houses, structures previously used in disaster relief
efforts in Grenada, Pakistan and Afghanistan, stood
in stark contrast to the Jeffersonian classicism of the
Sterling Divinity Quadrangle. They lent the tradition-
al Christmas creche an air of activist fervor .


The installation, which will stand through the end
of February, is the brainchild of Judith Dupre. A stu-
dent at the Yale Divinity School and Institute of Sacred
Music and a writer of architectural criticism, Dupre was
inspired by the Museum of Mode'rn Art's October 2005
exhibition, Safe: Design Takes on Risk, which included the
Global Village Shelters. To visually address "the housing
crisis facing a huge swath of the world's population," she
organized the display using shelters designed by Dan
Ferrara and Mia Ferrara Pelosi, a father-daughter indus-
trial design team from Morris, Connecticut .


ccMost people do not even realize that disaster re-
lief is a market," says Ferrara Pelosi. But the ccmarket"
to aid displaced populations is a growing sector both
here and abroad; she hopes that the installation will call
attention to this trend and "allow people to open their
minds and think actively about solutions."


Dupre intends to extend this educational goal be-
yond Yale and . New Haven after the exhibition closes.
celt was important for me that these wonderfully designed
shelters, the quintessential image of a simple house, have
another life once the Divinity School installation con-
cludes," she ~ays. The five shelters will be donated to
a hodgepodge of individuals and charitable institutions


in New York and Connecticut, including a church, an
installation artist, and the film department of a com-
munity college.


Easier to assemble than most Ikea furniture, the
houses are made from Tri-Wall, a biodegradable lami-
nate of corrugated cardboard and glue. This unique
material allows the units to be shipped flat and assem-
bled by unskilled labor in a manner evocative of open-
ing a pop-up book. In a matter of minutes, the houses
unfold into three dimensions to become streamlined
paper miniatures of the American single family home.


Despite their dreamlike appearance, the boxy
white shelters are explicitly utilitarian. To be effective,
the homes must be easy to assemble, environmentally
responsible, economical to ship, and· able to provide
basic privacy and safety. "It is important to design for
the inhabitant," Pelosi says, ccto always keep in mind
that you are creating a temporary home, something
that will give the user a building block to start over,
something that will provide some comfort in times of
extreme duress."


The structures are wind and fire-resistant and can
be easily customized to suit different environments.
Recipients can paint the exteriors, cut holes into the
cardboard for ventilation, and even convert the tempo-
rary shelters into permanent dwellings by laying bricks
against their frames. Such adaptability defines a new
era of mobile architecture for use in disaster-stricken ·
areas across the globe.


Pelosi emphasizes that appearance is not a prior-
ity. "I have found," she says,"that as a designer you
place focus on aesthetics but as a problem solver this
takes a back seat." In The Poetics of Space, Gaston
Bachelard defines the house,s presence as the psycho-
logical shelter which allows one to daydream in peace.
"For our house is our corner of the woild ... our first
universe, a real cosmos in every sense of the word. If
we look at it intimately, the humblest dwelling has
beauty." The beauty of these houses lies in their abil-
ity to restore to displaced persons the sense of their
own bodies as the center of the world around them.


The installation on the Sterling Divinity Quadrangle
remincfs its visitors of the sheltees role as a microcosm,
a place to dwell and dream.


pragmatic structures are beautiful for the way
they distill the basic symbolic elements that con-
stitute a conventional house. The door framing almost


suggests a front porch, and the hipped
roof evokes the archetypal American
Foursquare house, popularized in the
early twentieth century mail order
catalogs of companies such as Sears
and Montgomery Ward. From 1908
through the 1930s, prospective hom-
eowners could order house-building
kits and construct their own homes
in new suburbs. In 2006, these flat-
packed paper houses materialized in
the same way, to grant their inhabit-
ants the security to dream of a bet-
ter future. For the victims of disaster
relief, home begins as an image and
a box.


''Most of us here in New Ha-
ven are far removed
geographically,
emotionally, · intellectually from
the daily r~ality faced by those in
need of such shelters," Dupre says.
"I hope the installation will move
people to think globally and act on
behalf of the homeless."


Undergraduates don't have to
walk by the Divinity School Quad-
rangle for reminders . of the psycho-
logical and physical comforts basic
shelter provides; Yalies witness home-
lessness on a daily basis. The juxtapo-
sition of these shelters and the needy
in New Haven leads one to hope that
the structures might go beyond their
strictly expositional purpose.


"There are no plans for anyone
to live in these shelters," Dupre says.
"We invited several dozen churches
in New Haven to consider taking
a unit for themselves, but have yet
to hear back from them." Despite
their resemblance to the American
single family home, the possible use
of the Global Village Shelters to re-
lieve the local homeless population
would be severely limited; Tri-Wall
can't weather a tough New England
winter. Still, one can't help but hope
that they will not stay empty forever.
For those in need, even the humblest
dwelling can be a cosmos of hope.
