sues raised by Purell's detractors. 

Viertel and others worry that the gel-
dispensers may kill off susceptible 
bacteria only to leave us with mutant 
streams of more dangerous germs. 
"Pur ell spawns lethal megabacteria," 
declared sophomore Adam Gardner. 
"I feel sorry for anyone who uses the 
Purell machines; they have no idea 
what they are getting themselves 
into." Gardner is not ·alone in his 
distrust. "I call them deadly," said 
Junior Angel Hertselt, a STEP co-
ordinator, who finds the dispensers 
generally unnecessary. "I am of the 
opinion that 'Purell-ing' as an insti-
tutionalized daily habit is no good. 
As a child, I played in the dirt and 
Lord knows what I was exposed to." 
Yale Dining Services allegedly 
purchased the dispensers to help pro-
tect the bodies of the student body 
throughout flu season. According 
to Chuck Bennett, the Manager of 
Purchasing and Facilities, the risks 
of selecting for killer germs must be 
weighed against the risks of illness 
from more prevalent bacteria. "Sure, 
I think disease resistant bacteria are 
a societal issue. But bacteria can be 
easily transmitted by hand contact. 
What's the worse of evils?" asked 
Bennett. "No one requires anyone to 
use the dispensers." 

Purell's supporters don't under-
stand the fuss. "There is no risk with 
alcohol-based sanitizers," said Craig 
Roy, an associate professor of micro-
bial pathogenesis at the Yale School of 
Medicine. "Purell is the same concept 
as a doctor wiping your arm with a 
little alcohol before giving you a shot. 
It kills bacteria and many viruses by 
dehydrating them." Of the dining 
hall sentries, Roy says, "It's a great 
· ·idea to have stations where you can 
apply Purell." 

The Purell dispensers are popular 
with the dining hall workers as a whole. 
"I think it's excellent," a Saybrook din-
ing hall employee said. "Once I saw a 
boy come in here sneezing, nof wash-
ing his hands, eating food. That was so 
nasty, I jutnped on hi1n and told him 
February 2007 
to use some Purell." 

"I think Purell is wonderful and 
vital," said a Commons employee. 
"Every once in a while I just put my 
hands over here and get some." Her 
co-worker sees the popularity among 
students as well. ''I can tell the kids 
. 
think it's great too. They get excited 
when they see it. 
Sometimes 'they 
even miss it when they go in, and 
catch it on the way out." 

Many students do appreciate the 
addition to Yale's dining halls. "I love 
the dispensers," said Charles Gariepy. 
"Not only are they automated, which 
is highly convenient, but they demand 
attention for daily hygiene. That is a 
lesson in itself, I think." Sophomore 
Max Kramer believes: "Hand sanitiz-
ers are a good idea, but that might be 
because I'm paranoid." · 

The Purell website does little 
to alleviate such paranoia. It boasts 
a comprehensive list of "99 Places 
Where Germs are Likely to Lurk," 
including treadmill keypads, crayons, 
in-flight magazines 
and, perhaps 
most perilous, jump rope handles. 
"We also have a Workplace Well-
ness Program that puts Purell on the 
desk of each employee," said Angela 
Watkins, Media Relations manager 
for GOJO Industries, the company 
that created Purell. One elementary 
school even lists Purell among its 
required school supplies for kinder-
garteners. The company is overtaking 
America one squirt at a time, infiltrat-
ing even this Ivy League bastion of 
exclusivity. 

For both sanitation-zealots and 
anti-bacterial skeptics, the question 
remains: Are these fears a product of 
our neuroses, or is there a real risk? 
Viertel relates how an old professor of 
his. used to say "it is and always has 
been the age of bacteria." 

"I am okay with that. I think that 
an attempt to combat it is both futile 
and a sort of hubris," he said. The 
presence [of the dispensers] may be in-
dicative of a growing sense of disease 
in the relationship we have with the 
natural world and with each other." 


The risk inherent in mass sani-
tation . is perhaps more cultural than 
medical, its pervasive influence com-
pelling our society to sterilize every-
thing in sight. "The first time I saw 
the Purell dispensers I thought: totem 
pole," said Melina Shannon-DiPietro, 
co-directo"r of the Yale Sustainable 
Food Project. "But if one takes the 
dispenser as a . totem," she mused, · 
"does this piece of grey plastic and its 
alcohol-scented goo dispense a ritual 
act of unification for our community? 
Before breaking bread together, we'll 
bathe in cleansing goo?" She shud-
• 
dered at the possibility. "It's not really 
a ritual I want as part of my world."
