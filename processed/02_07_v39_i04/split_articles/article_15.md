THE RED DOTS ON NANCY Nick-
less's computer monitor indicate that 
the blood sugar levels of one of her 
clients are far outside of the safe 
zone. Levels should hover between 
65 and 140 units, but for this patient, 
the numbers fall closer to four hun-
dred. Nancy's office is on the fourth 
floor of Yale-New Haven Hospital 
in the Perinatal Unit. A large bulletin 
board displays photographs of chil-
dren whose mothers she's counseled, 
and a poem entitled "THANK YOU 
FOR CARING." 

A petite brunette with pageboy 
-style hair and a chipper voice, Nancy 
deserves to be thanked. She is the 
sole registered nurse in the high-risk 
obstetrics department certified as a 
diabetes educator. She counsels every 
patient at Yale-New Haven Hospital 
who develops gestational diabetes. 

Every year, the disease affects 
four percent of pregnant women 
in 
United 
States 
approximately 
135,000 cases. According to the Amer-
ican Diabetes Association "pregnant 
women who have never had diabetes 
before but have high · blood sugar 
(glucose) levels during pregnancy 
are said to have gestational diabetes." 
Like pant sizes and cholesterol levels, 
the prevalence of gestational diabe-
. 
tes has increased with the country's 
rising obesity problem. Nancy's cli-
ent with blood sugar levels in the 
four · hundred range, for example, 
weighs nearly five hundred pounds. 
Simple habits like healthy eating and 
regular exercise help combat gesta-
tional diabetes, but maintaining such 
habits does not come easily. Some of 
her clients cannot afford fresh foods; 
others have multiple children and no 
time for exercise. The five hundred 
pound patient continues to eat fast 
food, probably because burgers and 
fries are the most convenient way to 
feed her existing kids. Her failure 
to get healthy, however, endangers 
not only her own life, but the life of 
the next addition to her family. "At 
the rate she is going," Nancy says, 
"she'lllose the pregnancy." 

Over the next few months, 
Nancy's job will be to help this pa-
tient help herself: to teach her to 
modify her eating habits in order to 
protect her unborn child. But Nan-
cy's role as a maternal figure to these 
future mothers is limited; she can 
advise her patients, but she cannot 
force them to follow her advice. Just 
as these women have limited control 
over their diabetes, Nancy has lim-
ited control over them. 

The morning I meet Nancy in 
her office at Yale-New Haven, one of 
her patients has already failed to show. 
On the phone, the woman claims the 
medical cab never arrived to drive her 
to the hospital. Unsure of when she'll 
see the patient in person, Nancy seiz-
es the opportunity to gather informa-
tion she would have acquired dur-
February 2007 

ing the actual appointment. "While 
I have you on the phone, can I have 
your blood sugars?" she asks: The pa-
tient evades her question and, for the 
remainder of the conversation, Nancy 
attempts to steer her back: she wants 
the numbers. 

First the patient claims she lost 
her glucometer, the machine that 
measures ~lood sugar levels. Then 
she changes her mind it wasn't · 
lost but broken, her son had spilled· 
orange juice on it. Finally, Nancy 
hangs up and lets out a small sigh. 
"Well," she says. "I don't know how 
much of that to believe." Nancy's 
workday is weighed down by such 
conversations. Between transporta-
tion, child care, work, and the dis-
comfort of pricking one's finger to 
draw blood, it conies as no great sur-
prise that many of the women Nancy 
counsels fail to monitor their prog-
ress. Patients may not provide the 
. information she needs, but they have 
· no trouble recounting their personal 
woes. "I could be on the phone for 
hours with their personal problems" 
she tells me, "Some of these people 
begin with a lot." 

One woman would call from 
the back room of the store where 
she worked, crying because her boss 
would not allow her to sit down. 
She is 31-years-old and has "nine 
living children right now." N arrey 
flips through a list of patients. One 
woman has three kids, another has 
more 
and one woman currently 
in rehabilitation for drug abuse has 
seven. "But that doesn't stop them," 
Nancy says. "They keep coming 
back and having more.'' Multiple 
pregnancies and repeated bouts of 
gestational diabetes do not guaran-
tee that patients will adopt better 
habits." Missed appointments and 
non-compliance persist. "You can't 
make the horse drink the water 
when it's not good." 

Not all of Nancy's patients are 
difficult to track down. The patients 
who are best at maintaining their 
blood sugar are the .ones who have 
12 
the resources to do so: food, money, 
an education, and family support. But 
they also are not the women who are 
at the greatest risk. 

It's the women without resources 
who cancel their appointments, who 
refuse to take urine tests, who fudge 
their blood sugar numbers to· please 
her or simply to get her off their case. 
She mentions one woman who would 
call and claim that her blood sugar 
levels were in the range of one or two 
hundred. When Nancy reviewed the 
data herself, she found the numbers 
were actually closer to four hundred. 
She pulls up the patient's file on her 
computer and notices that she has 
since miscarried, after only fourteen 
weeks of pregnancy. 

"Sometimes 
h ' 
' 
"N 
t at s nature s way, 
ancy says mat-
ter-of-factly. "That baby was just 
swimming in glucose.'~ 

Nancy does not become sad or 
sentimental at the reminder of this 
failed pregnancy she did what she 
could and understands the inherent 
limitations of her job. Nancy can 
counsel women about the biology of 
gestational diabetes, but she cannot 
force them to . change their lifestyle. 
The most she can do is pick up the 
phone. The greatest help she can 
provide is her own availability. 

The telephone rings. "New cli-
ent,'' Nancy says. She starts to pull 
up files on her computer that she'll 
include in an information packet an 
explanation of the disorder with di-
etary guidelines. If Nancy mails it to 
her this afternoon, the patient should 
receive it either tomorrow or the day 
after. Nine months later, if all goes 
well, a baby will follow.
