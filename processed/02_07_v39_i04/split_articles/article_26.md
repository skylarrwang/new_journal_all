The Panic Room 
. 
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.

the intimidation begins with a . 
package bearing your name AND a 
frightening red stamp: "CONFI-
DENTIAL." You, the unfortunate 
recipient;' have been summoned to meet 
with the Executive c ·ommittee of Yale 
College 
"Excomm." Nowyoumustpre-
pare a statement, schedule a meeting, and 
choose attire that conveys sober remorse. 
Accompanied by a single ally your col-
lege dean you will ascend to SSS 41 0, an 
unlocked conference room in one of Yale's 
busiest buildings. While the room seems 
an unlikely setting for a show-down be-
tween old-boy tradition and youthful re-
sistance, this mundane space soon devel-
ops into the scene of a stifling inquisition. 

The , informal waiting area outside 
41 O's mahogany doors is lit by a skylight 
barred by a metallic grid. A member of 
Excomn1 will · eventually appear at the 
door and usher you into the room, where 
you will face anywhere from three to 
nine committee members, seated around 
an enormous, worn wooden table that 
stretches an imposing fifte~n feet long 
and five feet wide. There are fifteen aged 
chairs, most of which will stay empty. On 
the side of the table facing the door sits 
the Coordinating Group of the Executive 
Committee: Professor Paul Bloom, Dean 
Jill Cutler, and Dean Joseph Gordon. 

In this harsh venue of judgment, the 
air remains uncomfortably quiet. Gaze 
upwards, and you will observe a beam 
ceiling resembling a maht>gany cage. The 
Excomm room is impeccably clean, with 
a sterile air of authority. The thirty-by-
thirty foot space features a barren, unused 
fireplace and a tattered oriental rug. A 
few blemishes mar the traditional decor.

ITH STERN PORTRAITS AND AN ADVERSARIAL SEAT-
ING arrangement, the room is a manifestation of the 
I t , .._ 
power ~hat 
,Y;~~ have been accused of usurping. The chair 
pulled out for you has a stiff back that demands a flawless 
postur~; ·shoulders back and chest out. According to Dean 
Cutler, the room serves as another disciplinary judge. c'The 
room itself is the key," she explains. c'The people are hu-
mane, but the room is intimidating." A student member of 
the committee also argues that appearing before Excomm 
is "a punishment in itself ... [The room] should convey the 
unlimited power of the judicial body." A few years ago, 
administrators · discussed moving Excomm to the Dean's 
office on the :first floor of the building but voted against 
it. Dean Cutler describes how Excomm decided that the 
" 
-
more modern space was not intimidat-
ing enough. ccwe like the intimidation." 

This space also wracks the nerves 
of the judges themselves. Oil paintings 
of Astronomy Professor Charter Smith 
Lyman (Yale Class of 1837) and Engi-
neering Professor Augustus Jay Dubois 
(1849-1915) rest on either side of the 
room:~ doors. In his portrait, Dubois 
stares away from the painter -(and the 
Committ~e). He holds a pen and glasses 
while brooding over the papers before 
him. With his lips pursed and his eyes 
set, Dubois seems to announce himself 
as anot~~r judge of the transgressor. The aged pastor Ly-
man who gazes toward the doors with icy blue eyes, ghost-
ly skin, an4 wispy remnants of a beard, exuding moral au-
thority and Puritan strength. These judges have seen it all: 
everything from the relentless persecution of bootleggers 
during Pro~ibition to condemnations of students abusing 
the Internet. 

While early disciplinary procedures were, in Dean 
Cutler's words, "characterized by a lack of recognition 
for the rule of law," student pressure in-the 1960s forced 
Excotrun into new levels of transparency and accessibility. 
With the addition of student representatives and the annual 
publication of Exconun proceedings, the mysterious disci-
plinary body has been brought to the public eye. In Dean 
Cutler's view, this growing belief that student transgres-
sions should be understood as breaches of community trust 
has led to a moreopen system of punishment. ccYale re-
gards itself as a community,, she said, cc and you have to 
answer to the community.,, Punishment has increasingly 
been seen as educational. ccMost people [summoned by 
Excomm] have done stupid things with huge repercus-
sions,, she says. ccYale is often their first community 
experience, and they need to :figure out how to behave 
in a community." Lest Excomm seem anything less than 
· 
terrifying, she adds, cc Our hearts don't bleed for them." 

For some of its victims, the process offers a perverse 
thrill. Reflecting on his experience, a recent Excomm 
servivor explains, ccl kind of liked it. It was an interesting 
experience to have under my belt like wow, a chance 
to see backdoor bureaucracy that most don't get to see." 
He boldly relates the experience of Excomm 'cto being _ 
tapped into a secret society. [It's] a thrilling chance to see 
the secrecy of Yale,, Another recently Excomm-ed stu-
dent also enjoyed the exclusivity of 
the tribunal. celt's unknown territory, 
and it's exciting to see in person." 

LONGER BITTER ABOUT HIS 
JUDGMENT, the first student 
speaks positively about the room. 'cl 
like that this is Excotrun. You are at 
Yale 
not a shitty corporate office. 
Excomm is so Yale and so intense." 

Perhaps Excomm is a reward as well 
as a punishment, as the bold students 
who resist the constriction of tradi-
tional policies find themselves in the 
system,s mysterious yet entrancing underbelly. The ac-
cused students who fill this space of Puritan vindictive-
ness may have hoped to be there all along, to push past 
the ostensible rules of a well-oiled university machine 
and see the invisible forces that have driven it for so 
long. One student admits that, a year before his trial, he 
had surreptitiously explored SSS in search of the room. 
ccThere,s another way to get in, you know," he offers. 
'cThere,s a window through the bathroom, and you can 
climb onto a balcony and into Excomm at night."
