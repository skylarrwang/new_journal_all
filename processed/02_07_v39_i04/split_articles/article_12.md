AT I 2 3 POUNDS WITH LONG LEGS, 
long arms, and a short torso, Adrian's 
body is well-designed for his sport. 
"The more like a chimpanzee you're 
built," he says, "the more useful." 

Adrian climbed his first build-
ing in the third grade, on a wall of the 
school gymnasium. When his parents 
weren't looking, Adrian recalls, "I'd 
climb as high as I dared go." Today 
he climbs higher, scaling the gothic 
walls of Yale's residential colleges.· 

Adrian views climbing as a sci-
8 
ence. Before he begins a climb, he 
plots his path. The Art and Architec-
ture building is scalable if you know 
how to use your hands, but it's not 
a ''friendly" building, so he's held off. 
At "friendly" buildings, he can plan 
both his way up and his way down. 

From experience, Adrian knows that 
it's best to have three body parts 
touching the building at any one time. 
Inexperienced climbers · grab what-
ever handholds they can, latching 
onto fragile gargoyle tongues jutting 
out from Yale's gothic buildings_. (Ac-
cording to Adrian, a climber broke 
off part of an unlucky Bingham gar-
goyle.) 

Unlike Adrian, Shawn views 
climbing as anything . but scientific 
(Shawn's name has been changed). 
He often climbs after. a night out. At 
the end of . the night, as the parties 
wind down and the drunken haze 
lifts, he is sure-footed but inhibition 
free. Spurred by "some little worm 
that makes you want to go do cer-
tain things," he heads out for a climb . 
"You don't listen to it when you're to-
tally sober," he says. Alcohol lets him 
revel in the physicality of climbing 
without worrying as much about that 
for:ty-foot drop. "Things are reduced 
to what I need to do to get from one 
place to another," he says. 

The risk involved, Adrian says, 
. depends on where you are climbing, 
and how drunk you are. "I guess I'm 
na"ive, like most climbers," he says. 
"I perceive the real threat as being 
caught." 

While Adrian recognizes the 
physical hazards of climbing, he de-
clares that "to understand and to be-
lieve in risk are two different things." 
He uses a traffic analogy to explain 
his thought process: You can fully 
comprehend the risk of being hit by 
a car, but you'll still cross the street 
if you think you can make it. The 
same type of thinking applies to sex, 
he adds. "If you like doirig something, 
you suppress your fear, because your 
mind is a rational thing." 

At Shawn's high school, it was 
a tradition for students to climb the 
150-foot bell tower and smoke cigars 
at the top. Recalling friends who rap-
pelled down water towers and grain 
elevators at night. Shawn sees the risk 
only in retrospect. There was "just a 
harness and a rope and these 17-year-
old kids tying the knots." 

At Yale, Shawn doesn't use 
ropes, but relies on the complex orna-
mentation of building facades. "With 
all these gothic spires everywhere," 
he says, "if you're an amateur rock 
climber, it looks pretty cool." 

Shawn's Yale climbing career be-
gan at Silliman .. He used a fire exit on . 
an adjacent building to access the roof 
. Shawn's objective is often to get to 
the top of the building, whether that 
means reaching the roof or touching 
the tops of the gothic spires. 

While Shawn sometimes listens 
to music when he climbs, he rarely 
brings other people. He worries that 
they won't be safe. "I've done things 
I know aren't smart," he says, "like 
going along a ledge when I'm feeling 
sick to my stomach." But such risks, 
Shawn says, "put me in touch with 
something that other Yale . activities 
don't give." 

Judith, 
a 
member of Yale 
Climbing, loathes the idea of climb-
ing for the risk factor. After helping 
carry an injured climber off a cliff, 
she understands the danger of climb-
ing and tries to minimize it. "The 
people who do these things climb 
to the top under the cover of night," 
she says, "give the rest ~f us a bad 
name." Judith graduated from Yale 
in 2003, and during her time here 
scaled buildings with Yale Climbing 
as well as helped map low building 
climbing routes on campus that are 
still accessible on the _organization's 
website. "It's all about manageable 
risk," she explains, " ... and there's 
some objective risk left over." 

These bold stories frustrate 
those employed to keep Yale students 
safe. "People who have climbed East

Rock and gotten stranded have had 
charges brought on by the Fire De-
partment," explains Public Informa-
tion Officer Sergeant Steven Woznyk 
of the Yale Police Department, but 
the YPD considers climbers on a 
case-by-case basis 
"like any crimi-
nal investigation.'' 

Associate Dean Betty Trachten-
berg remembers how years ago stu-
dents were allowed to climb a small 
segment of a Durfee wall under care-
ful supervision. "Otherwise, we've de-
clined many requests," she added. "In 
my view climbing is dangerous both 
for the climber and the audience." 

Shawn feels that climbing is saf-
er at Yale than other places: "if you 
get in trouble, you can probably talk 
your way out of it." He rarely climbs 
at home now because he would be 
treated as a trespassing adult outside 
the safety net of Yale's "case-by-case" 
1nvesugauons. 

Adrian doesn't worry about 
trespassing. While playing an Old 
Campus-wide game of Assassins, he 
climbed into his target's Vanderbilt 
window and pelted her with a pair of 
socks to make the kill. The socks were 
never retrieved. He once irritated a 
studying student by climbing in~o his 
room through a bay window. Adrian 
politely asked the way to the stairs. 

Despite his attention to safety 
(and his manners), his practice got 
him into trouble with a dean, who 
accused him of breaking off a piece 
of the college wall. Adrian insisted 
that the fracture was from ice, not 
pressure, and pointed to the nature 
of the break. Calhoun's Master Hol-
loway intervened on Adrian's behalf, 
but said he would not be able to de-
fend hitn again. 

All out of free passes, Adrian 
knows how he will react if he is ever 
caught again. "In the future, that 
means if someone says, 'You there, 
come down,' it means keep going up, 
or run, if you can."
