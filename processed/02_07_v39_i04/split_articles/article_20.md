models, and though modeling nude 
may require a great deal of courage, it 
also seems to meld a personal knowl-
edge of the body a knowledge that 
the body is, as Elizabeth says, <<a tru-
ly amazing machine, a work of art in 
its very ability to do things as seem-
ingly simple as making cereal" with 
a more powerful conception of the 
self. Standing on a stage, naked, in 
front of strangers forces models to 
confront and overcome their own 
fears. Stripped of society and its cot- . 
ton accoutrements, the lone artist and 
the pure form contend with what it 
means to have a body, to be a human. 
The process of becoming art is, for 
the model, a method of self-portrait. 
So why was The Blue Binder, a 
record of so many positive experi-
ences, ripped from my hands after 
two minutes? Why wasn,t I-allowed 
to see the application to be a nude 
model? Why did the undergradu-
ate model I interviewed espouse the 
benefits of the process while with-
holding her name from publication? 
Why are the benefits of nude model-
ing confined to the studio in which 
they are experienced? 

The artistic community at Yale 
explains such privacy by contrasting 
their world with a vaguely defined 
"outside," which sees the Venus de 
Milo and screams "armless strip-
per." The "outside world," Yale Art 
would think, often wrongly sees the 
nude form as a taboo, and, like John 
Ashcroft and his drapery, would 
rather cover it. 

The popular conflation of sex-
uality and the nude form is an obvi-
ous problem that models confront. 
Elizabeth, the undergraduate model, 
has no problem telling her parents 
and friends about her on-campus 
job shes proud of her work, and 
besides, "ies a good boyfriend test." 
Jealousy is unattractive, and philis-
-
tinism even more so anyone who 
conceives of modeling for the Art 
School as just "flashing your tits 
to strangers" is "probably pretty 
closed-minded." Yet Elizabeth re-
fuses to publish her name, citing that 
February 2007 
"I used to try to suck 
in my stomach when 
I rst started," she 
recalls. Later, she re-
alizedthat"nobodys 
in a class to scout or 
Victoria's Secret 
models." 

many "assume that naked means be-
ing easy or irresponsible," and that 
"without having participated or ob-
served the modeling class dynamic it 
would be easy to assume that there,s 
something inherently devious in 
nudity with strangers." 

Sarah Lasley combats the "sex-
ual nude" stereotype with mockery. 
"When I model," she says, "I do 
cheesecake poses, I do pin-up stuff." 
Satirizing popular conception is her 
way of confronting it. Lasley admits 
that modeling nude is the only job 
she has ever had to hide from her 
parents. not because she is any-
thing remotely close to ashamed, 
but because their Southern Baptist 
values simply wouldn,t condone 
路 such behavior. 

The Yale Art SchooPs attitude 
toward nude modelling is strangely 
conflicted. On the one hand, it pro-
claims the nude is a representation of 
human beauty, a necessary tool for 
artistic training, and an empower-
ing symbol of identity which trumps 
the sexual prejudices of the outside 
world. On the other hand, a curious 
defeatism reigns: Within the halls of 
1156 Chapel, everyone is persuaded 
of the beauty of the nude, but tak-
ing one step out of the building 
renders any attempts at explanation 路 
meaningless. By recognizing a pub-
lic prejudice and only combating 
it within the privacy of the studio, 
nude modeling at Yale succumbs to 
the taboo it so vehemently opposes. 
If they won't understand it anyway, 
the reasoning goes, why try to set 
the record straight? 

Only once has Lasley ever felt 
ill-at-ease in a class. Two first-time 
male models were working as a pair路-
one would model only if the other 
would. Having never been nude in 
public, perhaps because they were 
on a dare, the models had no idea 
. what to do. Once the robes were off, 
they proceeded to model the same 
pose hands on slightly-thrust hips, 
with a stoic gaze into the distance, as 
if they had just crossed the Rubicon 
nude 路 for three hours. The usually 
aloof figure-drawing class devolved 
into heckling. "It was so uncomfort-
able/' Lasley told me, not because 
the men were naked but because of 
an absence of protocol. A lack of un-
derstanding about the nude model-
ing process had sexualized the pro-
ceedings and rendered them comic. 
The outside world had invaded the 
art building and transformed art into 
a one big joke. 

This is the fear that nude models 
at Yale face: the beauty of the nude is 
overshadowed by the world,s misin-
formed conception of it. It is a fear 
bred of division, of the walls between 
art and culture and their complicated 
breaching. The only awkward mo-
ments of a figure drawing class are 
its moments of transition, those 
seconds in which the model takes 
off her glasses, unties her robe, and 
for a split second is both art and art-
less, observer and observed, clothed 
and naked. ~n the portrait that Yale,s 
Art Department draws of itself, the 
model is half-clothed.
