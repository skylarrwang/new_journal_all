stories, health experts know the 
threat is still very real, and the Sec-
retary's Office does not underesti-
mate the enemy. Highsmith's team 
went back to the drawing board and, 
referring to recommendations from 
the Center for Disease Control and 
World Health Organization, came up 
with an estimate of how many peo- · 
ple might get sick and how the infec-
tion . rates might affect Yale's ability 
to function. The· plan they devised 
outlines roles for teams in academics, 
technology, and dining services. Each 
department considered the different 
scenarios and came up with its own 
contingency plan. Custodial services, 
for example, devised a strategy that 
would allow for less frequent clean-
ing based on the number of infected 
employees. Though· it seems absurd 
to care about sweeping the stairway 
when people are dying of avian flu, 
every detail is crucial to overall suc-
cess: In this case, maintaining some 
level of regular sanitation might pre-
vent more people from falling ill. 

So what would Yale's Pandemic 
Plan look like in action? No doubt the 
scene would be grim: Avian flu has 
spread across campus, and everyone 
from your TA to the shy girl down 
the hall has fallen ill. 
Highsmith's 
network anticipates that each of these 
unfortunate so:uls might hobble into 
University Health Services with suspi-
cious symptoms: wheezing, coughing, 
fever, eye infections, muscle soreness, 
and pneumonia. Diagnosing the situa-
tion, Health Services would sound the 
alarm. The Secretary's Office would 
be contacted first and they, in_ turn, 
would activate the Pandemic Plan, 
which would establish an Emergency 
Operations Center. From that point 
forward, the group would seize full 
control, like generals declaring mar-
tial law. The Emergency Operations 
Center would make all of Yale's deci-
sions, from the wording of press re-
leases to deciding if students should be 
home. And if parents require further 
proof that Yale takes its obligations as 
a surrogate family seriously, they need 
10 
not look further than the cell phone 
program included in the revised plan . 
In the case of a crisis, a reverse 9-1-1 
system would generate calls in a crisis 
to thousands of Yale families. Within 
minutes Mom and Dad would know if 
little Suzy was safe. 

Though many other colleges 
have emergency avian flu procedures, 
Yale's plan leads the pack. Connecti-
. cut's Department of Homeland Secu-
rity was so impressed by the U niver-
sity's approach that it asked Yale to 
serve as a case study at an upcoming 
conference. 

What makes Yale so successful 
at handling risk? It may be its over-
all lack of specific emergency plans. 
Highsmith notes that aside from 
avian flu, Yale does not have other 
detailed contingency plans in place. 
"One of the things people in. emergen-
cy managementlearned after Septem-
ber 11th is that you can't imagine the 
worst that will happen," Highsmith 
explains. It's just "wiser to have a 
flexible plan." In short,. Yale puts its 
faith in assembling the right group of 
experts to deal with whatever calam-
ity may occur. By monitoring the big 
picture while simultaneously scruti-
nizing the details, University officials 
leave no risk unexplored. Thanks to 
the Office of Risk Management and 
the Secretary's Office, Yale may not 
be quite as prone to worry as most 
parents but it's got a plan.
