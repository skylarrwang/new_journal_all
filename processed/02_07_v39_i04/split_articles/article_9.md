The Fall of Babkaman 
PHIL WEINBERGER USED TO BE 
Babkaman; now he's an unemployed 
baker who misses his customers. Ten 
months ago, Weinberger dosed New 
Haven's Westville 
Kosher ~ Bakery, 
which his family had operated for 
almost three decades. He'd been in 
charge since 1988, and his wife and 
kids had worked in the store. But af-
ter years of baking for a living, even 
a family like the Weinbergers was 
beaten down by the harsh reality of 
the kosher business. 

On top of the usual rent, labor, 
and advertising struggles faced by most 
small businesses, maintaining kosher 
certification adds a new dimension 
to the difficulties of 
· g a busi-
ness. Restaurants, grocery stores, and 
factories hoping to target the kosher 
market must work with a supervising 
rabbi or rabbinical organization. which 
regularly checks the business's facili-
ties to attest that it is adhering to ko-
sher law. National organizations with 
familiar certification symbols include 
the Orthodox Union (a circle with aU

(a circle with a K inside). Weinberger 
worked with OK for a couple of years, 
but ultimately looked to local rabbis 
to supervise his business. 

Supervision centers on the basic 
rules of kosher, or kashrut, in which 
there are three food categories: meat, 
dairy, and pareve. Meat and dairy 
cannot come into contact with one 
another, and though -rabbis have dif-
ferent views on the issue, most rec-
ommend waiting a good six hours 
to drink a glass of milk after eating a 
burger. Pareve items are considered 
neutral they have not come into 
contact with either meat or dairy. 

Most kosher bakeries are pareve, -
avoiding both meat and dairy so that 
their· products can be eaten with any 
meal. The Westville Bakery used to 
sell cheesecake, but cut it from the 
menu to attatn pareve status. 

After Weinberger assumed con-
trol over his parents' bakery, he decid-
ed to up the ante: He wanted to serve 
meat. The rules of kashrut surround-
ing meat are much more complicated 
than those that apply to a pareve bak-
ery. Most kosher restaurants serving 
meat avoid dairy altogether. 

Weinberger, however, dreamed 
up an elaborate system for separat-
ing the different kosher food groups. 
"My place was unique," Weinberger 
explained. "I don't think rd be lying 
if I said there was no other place like 
it in the United States." His system 
involved separate sinks and ovens, 
labeled utensils, two sets of pots and 
pans, and a color-coded kitchen. 

After adding meat to his menu, 
Weinberger was instructed by his 
rabbi to hire a mashgiach, an obser-
vant Jew well-versed in the halakhah, 
or Jewish law, and responsible for su-
pervising the kitchen on a daily basis. 
Mashgiachs are generally hired only 
when meat or fish is involved. Wein-
berger's mashgiach reported to his su-
pervising rabbi to confi.nn that the

Westville bakery, now also a deli, was 
adhering to the halakhah. 

These extra regulations were 
costly. Not only did Weinberger have 
to pay a full-time mashgiach in addi-
tion to the rest of his staff, but kosher 
meats, dry goods, and dairy products 
are more expensive than their non-
kosher counterparts. The Westville 
Kosher Bakery was blessed, however, 
with a loyal customer base. Many reg-
ulars were comforted by the family-
run nature of the bakery, and relied on 
it to cater intimate events like wakes. 
"They liked to see a family-oriented 
business," Weinberger remembers. 
Many regular customers became "dear, 
dear friends of the family." 

Praise for Weinbergees babka, 
which he'd recently begun selling 
online at Babkaman.com, wafted 
across Connecticut and into New 
York, eventually reaching the palate 
of the Food Network. In May 2004, 
Al Raker's show Roker on the Road 
set up shop in the Westville Kosher 
. . 
Bakery for a day and filmed the cus-
tomers, the staff, and most impor-
tantly the babka. After the episode 
aired, Babkaman.com was swamped 
with orders. Yet by June of 2006, the 
Westville Kosher Bakery was merely 
an empty room in a strip mall, ghosts 
of the family business fluttering across 
its dusty tile floor. 

When the Stop & Shop bakery 
went kosher, Weinberger flinched. 
When his rent soared, he took a hit. 
But what really put the Westville Ko-
sher Bakery over the edge was kosher 
politics. In 2005, after worki~g with 
many different supervising rabbis and 
national certification agencies, Wein-
berger was collaborating with an or-
ganization of local rabbis. Rabbinical 
upheaval within this organization re-
sulted in a tightening of reins on the 
bakery's actions, as well as a misun-
derstanding regarding the legality of 
the employed mashgiach's citizenship. 

Unhappy with his relationship with 
the organization, Weinberger decided 
to switch to the supervision of a single 
local rabbi. When he. informed his su-
6 
pervising organization of his decision, 
its rabbis told him that they did not 
support the kosher label of the new 
rabbi. They told him that they would 
not endorse this rabbi's certificatiort 
of his business to their congregations. 

After 
an 
embittered 
battle 
over the switch, Weinberger finally 
dropped ·the organization's kosher 
label for the new rabbi's. As prom-
ised, however, the spurned rabbis 
announced the turnover in the West-
ville bakery's kosher certification 
and told their congregants that they 
no longer endorsed the bakery as ad-
equately kosher. From here, business 
went under. 

"Customers who had come in 
three to four times a week no lon-
ger patronized us," Weinberger re-
called, cc so that finished us off." After 
decades of serving the kosher com-
munity, the Weinbergers' customers 
were much more than their liveli-
hood. "How would you feel if you 
were dear friends with someone for 35 
years and you did something, maybe it 
was unordinary," Weinberger referred 
to the bakery's final kosher supervi-
sion switch, "and they refused to talk 
to you?" 

Because Phil . Weinberger de-
voted his life to the tenets of Juda-
ism, the religious consequences of 
his story are particularly sad. He 
doesn't attend synagogue as often 
as he used to. The political nature of 
the bakery's closure cchas given me a 
different perspective on the religion," 
he reflected. "It's affected me. It's af-
fected my kids." 

Unfortunately for New Haven, 
there won't be much babka in Phil 
Weinberger's future 
he has no inter-
est in running a business or working 
in the food industry again. But, as a 
father of four, he's looking for work. 
"It's not easy, especially at my age. But 
we're moving on. We have a positive 
attitude, because you have to."
