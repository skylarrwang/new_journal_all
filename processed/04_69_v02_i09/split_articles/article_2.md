Hiroshima 
Robert Jay Lifton, professor of psychiatry 
at the Yale Medical School, has recently 
been awarded the National Book A ward 
in science for Death in Life: Survivors of 
Hiroshima, a book first reviewed in the 
New Journal. The following is his ac-
ceptance statement. 

I am grateful for this occasion. But Hiro-
shima permits no awards. It does require, 
though seldom receives, unflinching rec-
ognition. This recognition is important 
for the survivors of atomic bombing be-
cause it conveys to them the sense that 
their experience has significance for the 
world and for themselves. But it is even 
more important for the rest of us. We need 
Hiroshima to give substance to our terror-
however inadequately that city can rep-
resent what would happen now if thermo-
nuclear weapons were to be used on 
human populations. As a way of recogniz-
ing Hiroshima I shall forward one half of 
the monetary award to a Special Fund for 
Survivors; and the other !Jalf, equally 
divided, to two American groups: The 
Council for a Livable World, and Phy-
sicians for Social Responsibility-groups 
which refuse to allow us to deceive our-
selves about nuclear and biological 
weapons and insist that we pursue science 
to promote life, and medicine to promote 
healing. 

Nuclear weapons have already damaged 
us more than we know. They have created 
within us an image of historical extinc-
tion and caused us to feel severed from 
both past and future. They also impose 
upon us every variety of psychic numb-
ing-of emotional and intellectual anes-
thesia-so that we need not feel and cannot 
grasp their brutalizing effects upon human 
beings. This numbing not only interferes 
with our capacity to cope with the 
weapons themselves but extends into 
all of our perceptions of Jiving and dying. 
Rather than an age of anxiety, we live 
in an age of numbing. 

StiJJ worse, the weapons create in us an 
aura of worship. They become grotesque 
technological deities for a debased religion 
of nuclearism-gods sought by everybody 
as part of an all-too-human tendency to 
confuse the power of apocalyptic destruc-
tion with the capacity to protect, or even 
create, life. We then speak of nuclear 
stock piles, nuclear arsenals-of a benefic-
ent nuclear umbrella or of an equally 
beneficent system of Anti-Ballistic Mis-
siles. We perpetuate an illusion of security 
by means of step-by-step logic; but this is 
the logic of madness. 

Are we inexorably condemned to live 
out our image of historical extinction-or 
rather, to die out in accordance with that 
image? Had I thought so, I would not have 
attempted to say anything at all about 
Hiroshima. Both haunting and true is a 
phrase of Theodore Roethke: "In a dark 
time the eyes can see." The kind of vision 
needed for us to keep going as a species 
includes full confrontation with the weap-
ons themselves: with what they do, cause 
and mean. Through such Faustian immer-
sion into our particular purgatory, we may 
be able not only to cleanse ourselves but 
to understand our predicament and act 
upon it. Here and there have emerged the 
beginnings of such a vision: on the part 
of older generations who have lived 
through Hiroshima, and younger ones 
who, without yet focusing upon the 
specific nature of the weapons, have been 
trying to tell us that a world dominated 
by these weapons is not the only kind of 
world we need have. Hiroshima makes 
clear that our dilemmas are ultimate ones, 
that we are equally capable of destroying 
or renewing ourselves.
