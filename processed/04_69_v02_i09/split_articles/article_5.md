They desire, perhaps rightly, to get close to 
him and find out how decisions are made, 
how power is utilized. 

Whatever popular image the Law 
School may have at Yale or elsewhere, 
the school in reality is still geared to 
the production of lawyers interested in 
being part of an existing power elite in 
this country or in creating a new elite. 

The majority of students, though more 
interested than most future lawyers in 
reform; nevertheless regard themselves 
as working within existing institutions. A 
man like Rostow-a basically good man 
who has worked at a high level and even 
made some mistakes-is therefore a man 
who probably can be useful in under-
standing the mechanisms of the system. 

Like the students, the faculty has not 
responded to Eugene Rostow's return in 
any extreme or collective manner. The 
reasons for this have to do both with the 
relations established between Rostow and 
faculty members before his departure 
for Washington and with the amorphous, 
non-structured nature of the faculty. 

It is difficult to understand the faculty's 
response to Rostow without first recalling 
his past relations with these men. Rostow 
was dean of the Yale Law School for a 
ten-year, two-term period between 1955 
and 1965. Almost all faculty members 
would agree that at least during his first 
term his combination of idealism, energy 
and liberalism immeasurably helped ex-
pand the Law School and build it into 
possibly the top law school in the country. 

There is some disagreement over how 
effective his administration was in the 
second term, particularly the last year or 
two. Most have mentioned his virtues 
during this period, though one faculty 
member has referred to him during these 
years as a "sycophantish whore." Nevertheless, 
not only did the faculty give him 
a banquet on his departure, but the 
Alumni Association in 1965 awarded 
him the Annual Merit Award. 

Since Rostow returned within two years 
after taking his leave of absence, under 
university policies there was no doubt 
about his reappointment. Now that he is 
back, there seems to be a marked genera-
tion split among the faculty. Older mem-
bers who remember him as dean remain 
friendly though possibly less intimate. 

Among young faculty members, several 
of whom were students when he was here, 
response seems more negative. The least 
receptive of the young faculty attempt 
to avoid Rostow: although they don't de-
sire to confront him openly, they want to 
limit as much as possible their relations 
with him. An example of this reaction is 
the response of the faculty to a lunch 
given for Rostow on February 29th. A 
number of faculty members found them-
selves unable to attend because of other 
commitments. 

With very few exceptions, no matter 
how they feel toward him as a human 
being, most faculty members say that 
they don't discuss the war with Rostow. 
I believe that they would find such a dis-
cussion embarrassing and psychologicaJiy 
trying and that they would rather avoid 
the subject. None of the faculty members 
I talked with had read his book Law, 
Power and the Pursuit of Peace. 

In addition, a number of faculty mem-
bers have expressed serious doubts about 
Rostow's performance in faculty meetings. 
After a recent meeting between the faculty 
and the student negotiating team, no fewer 
than four faculty members approached 
one of the student negotiators and apolo-
gized for Rostow's behavior. 

Some measure of Rostow's inability to 
deal with issues at the Law School has to 
do with the peculiar timing of his depar-
ture and return. When he left New Haven, 
the student body was fairly quiet, if not 
complacent. On returning, Rostow found a 
very active student body. It is understand-
able that without seeing the process of 
change in the student body it would be 
difficult to understand current issues and 
pressures in regard to the community, 
social relevancy, black admissions and 
grading reform, for example. 

On the other hand, much of Rostow's 
inability to deal with students stems from 
his attitudes. In his concluding report as 
dean he said, 

In small, carefully rationed doses, such calls 
for university participation in programs of 
social action may, and sometimes do, con-
tribute to the primary tasks of the faculty. 
More often, however, they tend to divert the 
professoriate from the work which is its 
special charge-that of fundamental thought. 
The universities are uniquely the institu-
tions of society in which minds are encour-
aged to take high speculative flights, with the 
benefit of perceptions available only because 
universities are at one remove from the 
hydraulic pressures of everyday life and its 
immediacies. (p. 16) 

More recently he has stated that he is 
opposed to quotas and believes the faculty 
must independently balance the different 
pressures from student groups. 

None of these statements is unusual for 
a liberal academic administrator, and that 
may be why they are so troublesome. 

Students at this school, like groups else-
where, are asking institutions to change. 
They are attempting to expropriate a type 
of property-mental property-which for a 
liberal faculty may be more precious and 
hard to give up than material possessions. 

Eugene Rostow's attitudes clearly exem-
plify the faculty's hesitancy to change this 
institution. 

In addition, for many years the Law 
School faculty has prided itself on its in-
dependence. They seem to dislike acting 
as a corporate body and prefer responding 
to situations and persons as individuals. 
They have often justified this stand by say-
ing that it is just such a policy that has 
protected this school from outside inter-
ference and potentially hostile forces op-
posed to change. The faculty has an extra-
ordinary amount of freedom in choosing 
courses they wish to teach and in the 
academic relations they wish to establish 
with students. However, it is exactly this 
independence, this desire not to act as a 
body, that not only has made the faculty 
unable to respond to the return of Rostow, 
if they might have wanted to, but more 
importantly has made them unable to 
respond to recent student demands. 

In regard to Rostow, of course, this 
potential paralysis seems unimportant. 
Those faculty members who wish to avoid 
him-and their numbers seem considerable 
-seem to do so quite easily, and those who 
wish to continue their relationship with 
him are in no way hindered. This very 
style of acting, however, makes it hard if 
not impossible for the faculty to respond 
to student issues which are addressed 
to them as a corporate body. 

The faculty has recently been con-
fronted with a series of student demands. 
The current second-year class pressed for 
grading reform a year ago but failed, and 
this year the issue was pressed again. 
There was change that some think con-
siderable. The Black Law Students' Union 
challenged the faculty to act on the recruit-
ment of black students and faculty mem-
bers, but no one seems terribly satisfied 
with the response, including the faculty 
itself. Similarly, demands from students 
for an increased role in Law School deci-
sion-making have not met with favorable 
response. "If anything," one senior pro-
fessor said, "the faculty and students have 
moved further away from community and 
more toward tactical confrontation than 
ever before." 

These men, who individually seem so 
capable of creatively responding to situa-
tions, seem to lose something when they 
meet and act collectively. It isn't just that 
they have different views. When the nature 
of the group is individualistic and collec-
tive meetings are seen as secondary to 
amorphous functioning, then it is not hard 
to predict that such a group will have 
difficulty in dealing with issues put to it 
collectively. 

The faculty's abhorrence of collective 
action has had a major impact on students. 
Subjects such as curriculum, recruitment 
by employers, law journal work and even 
institutional reform produce little collec-
tive action. Personal ego involvement and 
career concerns, no matter how sub-
limated or unconscious, discourage col-
lective activity. The whole atmosphere 
of the Law School encourages personal 
response to situations, and students have 
been no more successful than the faculty 
in overcoming this barrier. 

The quietness of Eugene Rostow's re-
turn to the Law School is appropriate, 
since the school and the man are com-
plementary. The former Under-Secretary 
represents some of the tragedy of liberal-
ism, while the Law School exemplifies the 
tragedy of liberal institutions today. 

Unfortunately, Rostow is a good man 
and, from what most say, an idealistic 
man. But he believes fundamentally in 
the Vietnam war, and thus demonstrates 
the horrors good men can produce. More 
important, his return could serve as a 
catalyst for the Law School to look at 
itself. 

The students, many of whom are dissat-
isfied with their education, are neverthe-
less being trained to accept the boundaries 
of institutional reform. Many students, 
therefore, who are as idealistic and as 
good as Rostow (who considered himself 
a radical as a student) understand all too 
well that more likely than not they will 
end up in similar positions with similar 
restraints and responsibilities. 

The qualities on which the Law School 
faculty has prided itself are qualities cited 
for a country emerging from a depression 
and two wars. Yet today, as many pro-
ponents of liberal institutions are discover-
ing, faith in individual responses and in 
the impact of individuals on an institution 
is not very persuasive. 

The Law School made dramatic changes 
in the late thirties. The introduction of 
legal realism and the way it has been used 
at this school and carried into practice by 
Yale's graduates have placed this school 
in its prominent position. But the concepts 
developed then were ahead of their time; 
they no longer are. Soon they may be be-
hind the times. The Law School is in need 
of major changes and probably is ill-
equipped to make them.
