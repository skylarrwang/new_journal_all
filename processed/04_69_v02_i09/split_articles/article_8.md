EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
On Tuesday, March 4, over 1200 students and faculty 
fi·om the Cambridge community gathered in M.I.T.'s 
Kresge Auditorium to probe the uses and misuses of 
scientific research. The day seemed to plod on, and 
when Harvard biologist George Wald rose to speak, 
he met a shifting and restless crowd. George Wald, 
who won the 1968 Nobel Prize in physiology and 
medicine, is known among Harvard freshmen and 
sophomores as one of the best lecturers around. As 
Wald began his extemporaneous talk, his head arched 
back, and his eyes almost shut. The silence that per· 
meated the audience was broken only once by 
tremendous applause, and the end of his talk was 
met with a long standing ovation. 

The Boston Globe decided to reprint the entire text 
of the speech, calling it "the most important speech 
given in our time." 

The New Yorker reprinted the speech in Talk of 
the Town, omitting all cartoons from that section-
something that has not been done since Adlai 
Stevenson's eulogy. 

J ~~llof you know that ;n the last couple of 
•ears there has been student unrest, breaking at times 
'o violence, in many parts of the world: in England, 
rmany, Italy, Spain, Mexico, Japan and, needless 
., say, many parts of this country. There has been a 
gre•t deal of discussion as to what it all means. Per-
fectly clearly, it means something different in Mexico 
from what it does in France, and something different 
in France from what it does in Tokyo, and something 
different in Tokyo from what it does in this country. 
Yet, unless we are to assume that students have gone 
crazy all over the world or that they have just decided 
that it's the thing to do, it must have some common 
meaning. 

I don't need to go so far afield to look for that 
meaning. I am a teacher, and at Harvard I have a class 
of about three hundred and fifty students-men and 
women-most of them freshmen and sophomores. 
Over the past few years, I have felt increasingly that 
something is terribly wrong-and this year ever so 
much more than last. Something has gone sour in 
teaching and in learning. It's almost as though there 
were a widespread feeling that education has become 
irrelevant. 

A lecture is much more of a dialogue than many of 
you probably realize. As you lecture, you keep watch-
ing the faces, and information keeps coming back to 
you all the time. I began to feel, particularly this year, 
that I was missing much of what was coming back. I 
tried asking the students, but they didn't or couldn't 
help me very much. 

But I think I know what's the matter. I think that 
this whole generation of students is beset with a pro-
found uneasiness, and I don't think that they have yet 
quite defined its source. I think I understand the rea-
sons for their uneasiness even better than they do. 
What is more, I share their uneasiness. 

W. 
bothering those students? Somo of 
them tell you it's the Vietnam war. I think the Vietnam 
war is the most shameful episode in the whole of 
American history. The concept of war crimes is an 
American invention. We've committed many war 
crimes in-Vietnam; but I'll tell you something interest· 
ing about that. We were committing war crimes in 
World War II, before the Nuremberg trials were held 
and the principle of war crimes was stated. The sat· 
uration bombing of German cities was a war crime. 
Dropping those atomic bombs on Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki was a war crime. If we had lost the war, it 
might have been our leaders who had to answer for 
such actions. I've gone through all that hist_ory lately, 
and I find that there's a gimmick in it. It isn't written 
out, but I think we established it by precedent. That 
gimmick is that if one can allege that one is repelling 
or retaliating for an aggression, after that everything 
goes. 

And, you see, we are living_ in a world in which all 
wars are wars of defense. All War Departments are 
now Defense Departments. This is all part of the 
doubletalk of our time. The aggressor is always on 
the other side. I suppose this is why our ex·S~cretary 
of State Dean Rusk went to such pains to insist, as he 
still insists, that in Vietnam we are repelling an ag-
gression. And if that's w·hat we are doing-so runs the 
doctrine-everything goes. If the concept of war 
crimes is ever to mean anything, they will have to be 
defined as categories of acts, regardless of alleged 
provocation. But that isn't so now. 

I think we've lost that war, as a lot of other people 
think, too. The Vietnamese have a secret weapon. 
It's their willingness to die beyond our willingness to 
kill. In effect, they've been saying, You can kill us, 
but you'll have to kill a lot of us; y~u may have to kill 
all of us. And, thank heaven, we are not yet ready to 
do that. 

Yet we have come a long way toward it- far 
enough to sicken many Americans, far enough to 
sicken even our fig~ting men. Far enough so that our 
national symbols have gone sour. How t:nany of .you 
can sing about "the rockets' red glare, the bombs 
bursting in air" without thinking, Those are our 
bombs and our rockets, bursting over South Vietnam-
ese villages? When those words were written, we 
were a people struggling for freedom against oppres-
sion. Now we are supporting open or thinly disguised 
military dictatorships all over the world, helping 
them to control and repress peoples struggling for 
their freedom. 

But that Vietnam war, shameful and terrible as it is, 
seems to me only an immediate incident in a much 
larger and more stubborn situation. 

Part of my trouble with students is that almost all 
the students I teach were born after World War II. 
Just after World War II, a series of new and abnormal 
procedures came into American life. We regarded 
them ·at the time as temporary aberrations. We 
thought we would get back to normal American life 
someday. 

But those procedures have stayed with us now for 
more than twenty years, and those students of mine 
have never known anything else. They think those 
things are normal. They think that we've always had 
a Pentagon, that we have always had a big Army, 
and that we have always had a draft. But those are all 
new things in American life, and I think that they are 
incompatible with what America meant before. 

How many of you realize that iust before World 
War II the entire American Army, including the Air 
Corps, numbered a hundred. and thirty-nine thousand 
men? Then World War II started, but we weren't yet 
in it, and, seeing that there was great trouble in the 
world, we doubled this Army to two hundred and 
sixty-eight thousand men. Then, in World War II, it 
got to be eight million. And then World War II came 
to an end, and we prepared to go back to a peacetime 
Army, somewhat as the American Army had always 
been before. And, indeed, in 195o-you think about 
1950, our international commitments, the Cold War, 
the Truman Doctrine, and all the rest of it-in 1950, 
we got down to six hundred thousand men. 

Now we have three and half million men under 
arms: about six hundred thousand in Vietnam, about 
three hundred thousand more in "support areas" 
elsewhere in the Pacific, about two hundred and fifty 
thousand in Germany, and there ar~ a lot at home. 
Some months ago, we were told that three hundred 
thousand National Guardsmen and two hundred 
thousand reservists-so half a million men-had been 
specially trained for riot duty in the cities. 

I say the Vietnam war is just an immediate incident 
because as long as we keep that big an Army, it will 
always find things to do. If the Vietnam war stopped 
tomorrow, the chances are that wit~ that big a mili-
tary establishment we would be in another such 
adventure, abroad or at home before you knew it. 

lth;ng to do about the d••ft ;, not to ,.fo,m ;t 
but to get rid of it. 

A peacetime draft is the most un-American thing I 
know. All the time I was growing up, I was told about 
oppressive Central European countries and Russia, 
where young men were forced into the Army, and I 
was told what they did about it. They chopped off a 
finger or shot off a couple of toes or, better still, if 
they could manage it, they came to this country. And 
we understood that and sympathized and were glad 
to welcome them. 

Now, by present estimates, from four to six thou-
sand Americans of draft age have left this country for 
Canada, two .or three thousand more have gone to 
Europe, and it looks as though many more were pre· 
paring to emigrate. 

A few months ago I received a letter from the Har-
vard Alumni Bulletin posing a series of questions that 
students might ask a professor involving what to do 
about the draft. I was asked to write what I would tell 
those students. All I had to say to those students was 
this: If any of them had decided to evade the draft 
and asked my help, I would help him in any way I 
could. I would feel as I suppose members of the un· 
derground railway felt in pre-Civil War days, helping 
runaway slaves to get to Canada. It wasn't altogether 
a popular position then; but what do you think of it 
now? 

A bill to stop the draft was recently introduced in 
the Senate (S. 503), sponsored by a group of senators 
that ran the gamut from McGovern and Hatfield to 
Barry Goldwater. I hope it goes through; but any time 
I find that Barry Goldwater and I are in agreement, 
that makes me take another look. 

And indeed there are choices in getting rid of the 
draft. I think that when we get rid of the draft, we 
must also cut back the size of the armed forces. It 
seems to me that in peacetime a total of one million 
men is surely enough. If there is an argument for 
American military forces of more than one million 
men in peacetime, I should like to hear that argument 
debated. 

There is another thing being said closely connected 
with this: that to keep an adequate volunteer army, -


--- Page 11 ---

one would have to raise the pay considerably. That's 
said so positively and often that people believe it. I 
don't think it's true. 

The great bulk of our present armed forces are 
genuine volunteers. Among first-term enlistments, 
forty-nine percent are true volunteers. Another thirty 
percent are so-called "reluctant volunteers," persons 
who volunteer under pressure of the draft. Only 
twenty-one percent are draftees. All re-enlistments, 
of course, are true volunteers. 

So the great majority of our present armed forces 
are true volunteers. Whole services are composed 
entirely of volunteers: the Air Force for example, the 
Submarine Service, the Marines. That seems like proof 
to me that present pay rates are adequate. One must 
add that an Act of Congress in 1967 raised the base 
pay throughout the services in three installments, the 
third installment still to come, on April1, 1969. So 
it is hard to understand why we are being told that to 
maintain adequate armed services on a volunteer 
basis will require large increases in pay; they will 
cost an extra seventeen billion dollars per year. It 
seems plain to me that we can get all the armed forces 
we need as volunteers, and at present rates of pay. 

Yet there is something ever so much bigger and 
more important than the draft. That bigger thing, of 
course, is the militarization of our country. Ex-Presi-
dent Eisenhower, in his farewell address, warned us 
of what he called the military-industrial complex. I 
am sad to say that we must begin to think of it now as 
the military-industrial-labor-union complex. What 
happened under the plea of the Cold War was not 
alone that we built up the first big peacetime Army in 
our history but that we institutionalized it. We built, 
I suppose, the biggest government building in our 
history to run it, and we institutionalized it. 

I don't think we can live with the present military 
establishment and its eighty-billion-dollar-a-year 
budget and keep America anything like the America 
we have known in the past. It is corrupting the life of 
the whole country. It is buying up everything in sight: 
industries, banks, investors, scientists-and lately 
it seems also to have bought up the labor unions. 

I Defenoe Department ;, alway• b<oke, but 
some of the things it does with that eighty billion 
dollars a year would make Buck Rogers envious. For 
example, the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, on the out-
skirts of Denver, was manufacturing a deadly nerve 
poison on such a scale that there was a problem of 
waste disposal. Nothing daunted, the people there 
dug a tunnel two miles deep under Denver, into 
which they have injected so much poisoned water 
that, beginning a couple of years ago, Denver has 
experienced a series of earth tremors of increasing 
severity. Now there is grave fear of a major earth-
quake. An interesting debate is in progress as to 
whether Denver will be safer if that lake of poisoned 
water is removed or is left in place. 

Perhaps you have read also of those six thousand 
sheep that suddenly died in Skull Valley, Utah, killed 
by another nerve poison-a strange and, I believe, 
still unexplained accident, since the nearest testing 
seems to have been thirty miles away. 

As for Vietnam, the expenditure of firepower there 
has been frightening. Some of you may still remem-
ber Khe Sanh, a hamlet just south of the Demilitarized 
Zone, where a force of United States Marines was 
beleaguered for a time. During that period, we 
dropped on the perimeter of Khe Sanh more explo-
sives than fell on Japan throughout World War II, and 
more than fell on the whole of Europe during the 
years 1942 and 1943. 

One of the officers there was quoted as having said 
afterward, 'It looks like the world caught smallpox 
and died." 

The only point of government is to safeguard and 
foster life. Our government has become preoccupied 
with death, with the busines.s of killing and being 
killed. So-called defense now absorbs sixty percent 
of the national budget, and about twelve percent of 
the Gross National Product. 

j ~~ 
l;voly debate;, beg;nn;ng aga;n on 
whether or not we should deploy antiballistic mis· 
siles, the ABM. I don't have to talk about them-every-
one else here is doing that. But I should like to 
mention a curious circumstance. In September, 1967, 
or about a year and a half ago, we had a meeting of 
M.I.T. and Harvard people, including experts on 
these matters, to talk about whether anything could 
be done to block the Sentinel system-the deployment 
of ABMs. Everyone present thought them undesirable 
but a few of the most knowledgeable persons took 
what seemed to be the practical view: "Why fight 
about a dead issue? It has been decided, the funds 
have been appropriated. Let's go from there." 

Well, fortunately, it's not a dead issue. 

An ABM is a nuclear weapon. It takes a nuclear 
weapon to stop a nuclear weapon. And our concern 
must be with the whole issue of nuclear weapons. 

There is an entire semantics ready to deal with the 
sort of thing I am about to say. It involves such 
phrases as "those are the facts of life." No-these are 
the facts of death. I don't accept them, and I advise 
you not to accept them. We are under repeated pres-
sure to accept things that are presented to us as 
settled-decisions that have been made. Always there 
is the thought: Let's go on from there. But this time 
we don't see how to go on. We will have to stick with 
these issues. 

We are told that the United States and Russia, 
between them, by now have stockpiled nuclear 
weapons of approximately the explosive power of 
fifteen tons of TNT for every man, woman and child 
on earth. And now it is suggested that we must make 
more. All very regrettable, of course, but "those are 
the facts of life." We really would like to disarm, but 
our new Secretary of Defense has made the ingenious 
proposal that now is the time to greatly increase our 
nuclear armaments, so that we can disarm from a 
position of strength. 

I think all of you know there is no adequate defense 
against massive nuclear attack. It is both easier and 
cheaper to circumvent any known nuclear-defense 
system than to provide it. It's all pretty crazy. At the 
very moment we talk of deploying ABMs, we are also 
building the MIRV, the weapon to circumvent ABMs. 
As far as I know, the most conservative estimates 
of the number of American who would be killed in a 
major nuclear attack, with everything working as well 
as can be hoped and all foreseeable precautions 
taken, run to about fifty million. We have become 
callous to gruesome statistics, and this seems at first 
to be only another gruesome statistic. You think, 
Bang!-and next morning, if you're still there, you 
read in the newspapers that fifty million people were 
killed. 

But that isn't the way it happens. When we killed 
close to two hundred thousand people with those 
first, little, old-fashioned uranium bombs that we 
dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, about the same 
number of persons were maimed, blinded, burned, 
poisoned and otherwise doomed. A lot of them took 
a long time to die. 

That's the way it would be. Not a bang and a cer-
tain number of corpses to bury, but a nation filled 
with millions of helpless, maimed, tortured and 
doomed persons, and the survivors huddled with 
their families in shelters, with guns ready to fight off 
their neighbors trying to get some uncontaminated 
food and water. 

A few months ago, Senator Richard Russell, of 
Georgia, ended a speech in the Senate with the words 
"If we have to start over again with another Adam 
and Eve, I want them to be Americans; and I want 
them on this continent and not in Europe." That was 
a United States senator making a patriotic speech. 
Well, here is a Nobel laureate who thinks that those 
words are criminally insane. 

How real is the threat of full-scale nuclear war? I 
have my own very inexpert idea, but, realizing how 
little I know and fearful that I may be a little paranoid 
on this subject, I take every opportunity to ask re-
puted experts. I asked that question of a distinguished 
professor of government at Harvard about a month 
ago. I asked him what sort of odds he would lay on 
the possibility of full-scale nuclear war within the 
foreseeable future. "Oh," he said comfortably, "I 
think I can give you a pretty good answer to that 
question. I estimate the probability of full-scale nu-
clear war, provided that the situation remains about 
as it is now, at two percent per year." Anybody can do 
the simple calculation that shows that two percent per 
year means that chance of having that full-scale nu-
clear war by 1990 is about one in three, and by 2000 
it is about fifty-fifty. 

M 
tMnk I know what ;, bothering tho otudonh. I 
think that what we are up against is a generation 
that is by no means sure that it has a future. 

I am growing old, and my future, so to speak, is 
already behind me. But there are those students of 
mine, who are in my mind always; and there are my 
children, the youngest of them now seven and nine, 
whose future is infinitely more precious to me than 
my own. So it isn't just their generation; it's mine, too. 
We're all in it together. 

Are we to have a chance to live? We don't ask for 
prosperity or security. Only for a reasonable chance 
to live, to work out our destiny in peace and decency. 
Not to go down in history as the apocalyptic gen· 
eration. 

And it isn't only nuclear war. Another overwhelm-
ing threat is in the population explosion. That has 
not yet even begun to come under control. There is 
every indication that the world population will double 
before the year 2000, and there is widespre•d ex-
pectation of famine on an unprecedented sc•le in 
many p~rts of the world. The experts tend to differ 
only in their estimates of when those famines will 
begin. Some think by 1980; others think they can be 
staved off until 1990; very few expect th•t they will 
not occur by the year 2000. 


--- Page 12 ---

That is the problem. Unless we can be surer than 
we now are that this gener11tion has a future, nothing 
else matters. It's not good enough to give it tender, 
loving care, to supply it with bre11kfast foods, to buy 
it expensive educ11tions. Those things don't mean any-
thing unless this generation h111 11 future. And we're 
not sure that it does. 

I don't think that there 11re problems of youth, or 
student problems. All the re11l problems I know about 
11re grown-up problems. 

'-P• you wUI th;nk me eltogethe• ebsunl, 
or "academic," or hopelessly innoce nt- that is, until 
you think of the 11lternatives-if I s11y, as I do to you 
now: We have to get rid of those nuclear we11pons. 
There is nothing worth h11ving that can be obt11ined 
by nuclear war-nothing m11terial or ideological-no 
tr•ditlon that it c11n defend. It is utte rly self-defeating. 
Those atomic bombs represent 11n unusable weapon. 
The only use for an 11tomic bomb is to keep some-
body else from using one. It can give us no protection, 
only the doubtful s11tisfaction of retaliation. Nuclear 
we11pons offer us nothing but 11 bal11nce of terror, and 
a b11lance of terror is still terror. 

We have h11ve to get rid of those atomic weapons, 
here and everywhere. We c11nno~ live with them. 

I think we've reached a point of great decision, not 
just for our nation, not only for all humanity, but for 
life upon the e11rth. I tell my students, with a feeling 
of pride that I hope they will share, that the carbon, 
nitrogen, and oxygen that m11ke up ninety-nine per 
cent of our living subst11nce were cooked in the 
deep interiors of e11rlier gener11tions of dying st~~rs. 
Gathe red up from the ends of the universe, over bil-
lions of years, eventu11lly they came to form, in part, 
the substance of our sun, its pl11nets, and ourselves. 
Three billion ye11rs ago, life 11rose upon the earth. It 
is the only life in the sol11r system. Many a star hilS 
since been born 11nd died. 

About two million ye•rs 11go, man appeared. He 
h11s become the domin•nt species on the e 11rth. All 
other living things, 11nimal 11nd plant, live by his 
suffer•nce. He is the custodi11n of life on e11rth 11nd 
in the solar system. It's 11 big responsibility. 

The thought th11t we're in competition with Rus-
sians or with Chinese is all11 mist•ke, and trivi11l. We 
are one species, with • world to win. There's life all 
over this universe, but the only life in the solar system 
is on earth, 11nd in the whole universe we 11re the 
only men. 

Our business is with life, not de•th. Our ch11llenge 
is to give wh11t account we c11n of wh11t becomes of 
life in the sol11r system, this comer of the universe 
th11t is our home; 11nd, most of all, what becomes of 
men-all men, of all nations, colors and creeds. This 
has become one world, a world for all men. It is only 
such a world that c11n now offer us life, and the 
chance to go on. 1f1111
