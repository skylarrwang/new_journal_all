Miller 
After two and half years hairdresser 
James Miller and Professor of Law Steven 
Duke will be able to relax for a while. 
On March 14 the United States Court of 
Appeals for the Second Circuit threw out 
MiJler's narcotics smuggling conviction 
on the grounds that the prosecutor should 
have revealed that his prime witness had 
been hypnotized prior to the trial. 

Miller and Duke may have only enough 
time to catch their breath, however, since 
the Justice Department can initiate new 
proceedings and call for a new trial at any 
time. The United States Attorney for 
Connecticut, Jon 0. Newman, who aided 
in the prosecution of Miller's first trial, 
won't say that he will seek a new trial, 
but he won't deny it either. 

Although Miller claims that unethical 
and illegal methods were used by federal 
agents in their attempts to produce evi-
dence of his guilt, the court maintained 
confidence in the good faith of US At-
torney William Butler, who hypnotized 
Michel Caron, the witness, and who later 
failed to reveal the hypnosis at the time 
of Miller's trial. The court's view of the 
case, as expressed in the opinion written 
by Circuit Judge Henry Friendly, is at 
best a grudging admission that unfair 
methods were used by the government in 
the prosecution of Miller; in fact, the 
court looks upon the whole affair as un-
fortunate rather than tragically misguided. 

The court's opinion does not deal with the 
broader charges Professor Duke raised in 
the course of his defense: namely, that 
the government made up its mind in ad-
vance to "gang up" on Miller and then 
set about digging up the evidence neces-
sary to convict him. 

Friendly's opinion does not deal with 
the question of Miller's innocence or guilt 
either; it merely admits that the hypnosis 
should have been revealed. In throwing 
out Miller's conviction Friendly says, 
"We have reached this conclusion with 
some reluctance, particularly in light of 
the considered belief of the able and con-
scientious district judge-who had lived 
with this case for years-that review of the 
record in light of all the defense new-trial 
motions left him 'convinced of the cor-
rectness of the jury's verdict.' We, who 
also have had no small exposure to the 
facts, are by no means convinced other-
wise .... If the price of our decision should 
be the ultimate escape of a guilty man 
rather than the vindication of an innocent 
one, this is the kind of case where that 
price is worth paying." 

Although Newman doesn't think the 
case has any broad implication and al-
though Steven Duke says he took the case 
not to defend any particular legal techni-
cality but to seek the "vindication of an 
innocent man," still Time magazine, in its 
cool, holier-than-thou way, managed to 
glean the truth, mentioning that Friendly's 
opinion may serve as a basis for future 
rulings on the use of hypnosis in criminal 
cases. Friendly does not say that hypnosis 
should disqualify a witness, and he thinks 
Caron should be aJlowed to testify at any 
new trial of MiJier. But he does say that 
hypnosis may, at least, make a witness's 
testimony slightly questionable. "Here, 
then, is a science-if such it can be de-
nominated-which is in a comparative 
infancy and which, insofar as its use in a 
court is concerned, is not even on the 
threshold," Circuit Judge Moore says, 
mixing his metaphors in a concurring 
opinion. "In such a pasture what are or 
should be the ruJes of the game? For court-
room purposes, they have not even been 
drafted." 

On the Frank McGee Report two days 
after the court handed down its decision, 
Miller said that the decision, based on a 
legal technicality, was "only the beginning. 
It will take me the rest of my life to clear 
my name and to remove the stigma of all 
this.'' Duke is, of course, elated at the 
decision and says he will stick with the 
case until the end, whenever that comes. 
Although he wishes the press had not 
been so hostile and so inaccurate all along 
(he even pointed out a glaring mistake in 
the short Time piece), he isn't complain-
ing. He agrees with his hairdresser client, 
who says: "Finally justice has been found. 
It was hiding in this case, but now it has 
been found. Of course I never should have 
been arrested, but still the sky does look 
a little bluer and the whole world looks 
a little brighter."
