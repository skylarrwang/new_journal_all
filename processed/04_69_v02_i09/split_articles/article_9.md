Misunderstanding; The Free Press, 218 
pages. 

One can discern in Daniel Patrick Moy-
nihan's Maximum Feasible Misunder-
standing the outlines of an old-fashioned 
morality drama. The villains in this history 
of the anti-poverty program are the "lib-
eral-radical reformers" who, Moynihan 
tells us, presume to know what ails society, 
and who superimpose their own values on 
the poor. How do they do this? By assum-
ing that the poor have the best understand-
ing of "their problems and accordingly 
should be given the power to make dec is-
s ions about it [sic]." If I understand Moy-
nihan, reformers who encourage the poor 
to determine their own destiny are exer-
cising an arrogant elitist directiveness! 

It is Moynihan's own view that only the 
established institutions can properly fight 
the war on poverty. (Yet he does not 
thereby consider himself guilty of elitist 
superimposition.) He believes the poor 
lack the virtues necessary for proper po-
litical participation. Their involvement 
tends to be a disruptive influence; further-
more, he says, "It may be that the poor 
are never 'ready' to assume power in an 
advanced society: the exercise of power in 
an effective manner is an ability acquired 
through apprenticeship and seasoning." 

I disagree. In my own direct contact with 
black communities in Newark, New York 
and New Haven, I have been impressed 
repeatedly by the leadership abilities dis-
played by various elements among the 
black poor. If in fact their endeavors and 
their dramatizations often prove futile, it 
is not because they lack skills and season-
ing but because they Jack power. 

Moynihan asserts that the ghetto resi-
dents were never particularly interested 
in the war on poverty; he cites the light 
turnout for the various community board 
elections as evidence of apathy. But one 
striking characteristic of the dispossessed 
is their understandable suspicion that the 
ballot box rarely brings changes in their 
life conditions and that those who accede 
to office have little regard for their plight. 
Their electoral non-participation, then, is 
born more often of defeatism and cyni-
cism than of apathy. Writing in 1968 as 
if the riots of 1967 had never occurred, 
Moynihan has yet to learn the difference 
between apathy and alienation. 

Nowhere in Maximum Feasible Misun-
derstanding do the poor themselves make 
an appearance. Their views, hopes and 
grievances are never once heard, and no 
attention is given to the problems they 
face. To conclude that Moynihan pos-
sesses, at best, only a limited second-hand 
understanding of the world of the black 
poor is inevitable. He ignores the ample 
evidence unearthed by investigators like 
Studs Terkel and Paul Jacobs, who point 
out that most black families are headed 
by hard-working, self-respecting, respon-
sible parents who Jove and care for their 
children and who are victimized not by a 
lack of proper "motivation" but by long 
work hours, substandard wages, under-
employment, job discrimination, deterio-
rating housing conditions, rent-gorging 
landlords, shoddy overpriced goods, police 
brutality, a punitive and degrading welfare 
system, lack of recreational facilities, and 
abominable schools and hospitals. In 
Michael Parenti is a political scientist and 
author of The Anti-Communist Impulse, 
which will be published by Random House 
this fall. 
short, the major causes of their misery and 
low morale can be found in the mistreat-
ment and exploitation accorded them by 
the socio-economic system. 

Moynihan has nothing to say about 
systemic injustices; rather, he seems to fall 
back on those fanciful studies which con-
clude that "the sources of gang delin-
quency lie in the early socialization of 
male children in a lower class matriarchal 
home." He prefers the earlier Mobilization 
for Youth (MFY) program which was "a 
promising device" to "solve the private 
difficulties" of youth. For him it is not the 
system, but the victims of the system that 
need to shape up. 

If trouble comes to the system, it must 
be because outside agitators, in this case 
"OEO guerillas," "ADA intellectuals" and 
"MFY theorists," arouse the placid poor, 
hoping to throw America "into the kind of 
chaos out of which revolutionary situa-
tions are made." Sounding not so very 
unlike George Wallace, he alludes to "the 
various forms of public disorder either 
sanctioned, induced or Jed by middle-class 
liberal-radicals," a statement that will 
come as a surprise to the ghetto blacks 
who had no idea whitey was behind all the 
arson and looting. 

In Maximum Feasible Misunderstand-
ing Moynihan has the unbecoming habit 
of caricaturing other people's motives, 
thereby avoiding the necessity of having 
to confront their arguments. The MFY 
dedication to lower-class participation, for 
example, is at one point sarcastically dis-
missed as a product of the "changing fash-
ion in ideas," "the 'thing' for the 1960s." 

In one curious outburst he charges: "So-
cial scientists love poor people. They also 
get along fine with rich people. (Not a few 
are wealthy themselves, or married to 
heiresses .... ) But, alas, they do not have 
much time for the people in between ... 
[and] little sympathy with the de~ ire for 
order, and anxiety about change, that are 
commonly enough encountered among 
working-class and lower-middle-class per-
sons." As if this were not enough, he 
claims there exists a rich-poor conspiracy 
against the virtuous lower-middle strata, 
an "elite-proletat :an axis" with elite jour-
nalists controlli. g the mass media and 
propagating "th., romanticization of the 
proletariat." 

The only sub .. tantive programmatic 
suggestion he proffers in this book betrays 
his own maximum misunderstanding of 
ghetto sentimen•s. Why, he asks with all 
apparent seriou~ness, were poverty funds 
not used to "support and expand the ac-
tivities of the small fundamentalist 
churches of the Negro community and the 
Pentacostal sects of the Puerto Ricans?" 
After aU, these are the only truly indigen-
ous slum institutions. Is it that "hymn-
shouting and bible-thumping somehow 
does not elicit in the fancies of the white 
radical quite the same fascinations as does 
the black demi-monde?" Mmm, yes, Pat, 
that must be it. 

Moynihan cannot understand why any-
one might think that the established politi-
cal organizations "were somehow not 
meeting the needs of the people." He does 
not realize that slum dwellers do not share 
his highly romanticized and largely inac-
curate picture of the beneficence of Tam-
many Hall. He himself points out that 
machine politicians like Daley of Chicago 
and Addonizio of Newark used every pres-
sure at their command to prevent the poor 
from controUing community programs. 
But he never suggests that the political 
bosses exercise some of the seasoned flex-

ibility and restraint which he demands of 
the poor. Once more his sympathies are 
with the victimizers rather than the vic-
tims. If City HaJI acts with power-hungry, 
bullying intent toward the protestors, well, 
that's the name of the game. One should 
"not complain when bashed," and the agi-
tators have only themselves to blame 
"when the animal defended itself." "The 
Left has much to answer for in American 
life," he admonishes, "and not least for 
having brought about a too ready rejection 
by men of the center of any assertion of 
proletarian cohesion and purpose." Less 
agile minds would think that the men of 
the center might occasionally be made to 
answer for their own behavior.Indeed, the 
poor can be held accountable because they 
are weak, but how do we hold the estab-
lished institutional power-wielders respon-
sible for their actions? 

Moynihan evades other questions: How 
do the powerless effect changes in a sys-
tem that responds only to power? And how 
do they achieve power when they are de-
nied access to the resources that determine 
power? He seems to imply that there is a 
non-political, non-controversial, techno-
cratic way of reallocating resources and 
bringing about substantive changes, but he 
does not reveal what it is or how it might 
be effected. His real concern seems to be 
that others be kept from causing conflict 
within the system. 

So Daniel Patrick Moynihan once more 
shows himself to be the well-publicized 
social critic who manages never to antago-
nize those who preside over the corporate, 
financial , educational and political institu-
tions of our nation. Maximum Feasible 
Misunderstanding does not live up to the 
pre-publication attention it received. Writ-
ten in a hurried, evasive style, it offers a 
superficial and essentially second-hand 
account-much of it taken from the New 
York Times-of the origin and outcome of 
the anti-poverty program. According 
to the author, the poverty program was 
planned in confusion and soon became the 
captive of those who used the "maximum 
feasible participation" clause to lead the 
poor into fruitless confrontations with the 
powers that be. The end result was a defeat 
for the war on poverty. 

In a recent article Marilyn Mercer 
noted that the educated money in Wash-
ington thinks that fighting-liberal-intellec-
tual Pat Moynihan will not last more than 
six months with the Nixon Administra-
tion. My money says Dick and Pat will 
get along beautifully. filii'
