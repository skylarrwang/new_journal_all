Opera 

The ordeal of obtaining tickets to the 
Metropolitan Opera in New York is one 
that many Yalies go through several times 
a year: writing for tickets, having the 
check returned with a "sorry, sold out" 
note, then going down to Lincoln Center 
to wait in line for hours to obtain some 
of the precious few tickets reserved for 
box office sale. 

Things may be easier next year. A group 
of students is presently working with the 
Met to reconstitute the Yale Opera So-
ciety, which until its demise about ten 
years ago owned a box of eight seats in 
the opera house. The society, beginning 
in September, plans to reserve a similar 
box for either ten or twenty performances 
spread throughout the season. It will then 
operate as a ticket service, reselling the 
total of 80 or 160 seats to members. 

Membership will be open to all Yale 
College students, graduate students and 
faculty members. A modest registration 
fee will be charged to cover administrative 
expenses; seats will then be sold at box 
office prices. Members will receiv~ the 
season schedule in September and will 
draw lots for ticket preference if the 
demand for one particular opera exceeds 
the society's ticket supply. 

The box will probably be secured for 
Saturday m atinee performances. Final 
choice o(day, however, and the number of 
performances will be arranged with the 
Metropolitan depending upon the size of 
the society's membership. So that this de-
mand can be determined and final arrange-
ments made before the Met's late-April 
deadline, it is asked that all those con-
sidering membership write immediately 
to Yale Opera Society, c/o Box 11, Yale 
Station. Each potential member should 
indicate preference for matinee or evening 
performances and include an estimate of 
the number of performances he is inter-
ested in attending. 

Depending upon the location of the box, 
and whether society members request a 
matinee or an evening opera series, ticket 
prices will range from $1 1.50 to $13.50.
