Coffin 
The fervor that prompted 500,000 people 
to march on the Pentagon last October 
and stirred such masterpices as Armies of 
the Night seems somehow drained. The 
seniors with whom I talked last year about 
ending the war are now talking about 
Officers Candidate School. 

Yet as people are busy putting every-
thing out of their minds and getting ready 
to accept the unacceptable as fate, there 
is one thing that really must not be for-
gotten. 

William Sloane Coffin, Jr. has now been 
in legal battle for over a year trying to 
defend the right of free speech in an in-
creasing paranoid country. Exorbitant is 
not a good word to describe the legal 
expenses he has incurred. Absurd might 
be a better word, considering he is paying 
the cost of defending rights which should 
go unquestioned anyway. 

Coffiin has repeatedly turned down 
money from the ACLU so that it might go 
to other members of the Boston Five, 
who he feels need it more. Recently a 
number of students have gotten together to 
form a student compaign to raise money 
for Coffin. Questions of the war or Coffin's 
position are almost irrelevant-the real 
question is free speech. 

Hopefully all undergraduates will give 
generously when they are canvassed. All 
others who want to give, please send a 
check made out to: "Students In Support 
of Coffin" or "SSC'' to 500 Yale Station.
