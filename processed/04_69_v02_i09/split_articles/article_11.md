Flying Saucer 

Two old books, a new book, a band-
painted tie from Rosenberg's, some 
French term papers, a track shoe, a shoe 
horn-all stuffed in a large brown paper 
grocery bag. Of course we weren't ex-
pecting any success; nevertheless our 
intent was to set out from the Old Campus 
to barter them for two movie tickets. We 
were indulging in a bit of deviance for a 
course of the same name given by the 
sociology department. 

"Two tickets?" In the middle of her 
life, the lady at Loew's greets patrons with 
pointed nose and cold stare. She gave us 
two tickets and we gave her the necktie. 
She said "That'll be two dolJars," and we 
said "Wouldn't you like Roger Bannister's 
track shoe?" 

"Don't bother me," she countered as 
she cautiously closed the money bole in 
the glass window. "Go next door to the 
College Street Cinema." 

"But 1 don't think I can do this." She 
was young, blond-pretty, confused and 
indeed embarassed. "People like you? 
What are you doing this for?" 

"To see the show," we responded. She 
stared for a while before taking up the 
phone to caJJ the manager. There are two 
students here, she was saying, and they 
seem to have a "misunderstanding." 

When she had finally shunted responsibil-
ity for us from her~lf to the unseen man-
ager, her manner was distinctly more 
relaxed. 

"Will you wait? The manager will be 
here in a moment." We asked if she were 
a student, for we had some excellent term 
papers to trade. No, she wasn't a student. 
And her friends, the ticket-taker and the 
popcorn girl who were now peering at us 
from behind the corner awaiting the 
confrontation, were they students? No, 
and they couldn't read French. By this 
time the manager and his lackey were ap-
proaching with a gait that told us we would 
lose. We left. 

The Crown Street Theater we expected 
to be somewhat more understanding. 

"These are valuable to you and maybe 
to me, but I have no right to accept these

things. It isn't my theatre and the owner 
is away." As she said this the ticket lady 
nestled the phone in her breast cleft. De-
prived of ownership, she realized she was 
forced to deal with us through the im-
personal exchange of money. We were 
thinking she might make a good incipient 
Marxist when we heard her resume her 
telephone conversation as we walked 
away: "Now you know what I have to 
deal with in this weird neighborhood. Did 
you hear that?" 

Across the lonely, wind-swept reaches 
of the Oak Street Connector we journeyed 
to the last outpost of impropiety, there-
cently-renovated Princess Theatre, which 
symbolically stands next to the HiJI Re-
development Office on Davenport Avenue. 
On the way, however, across from the 
Child Study Center, we noticed a plain 
storefront added to the white frame house 
of the 1880s, typical for that part of the 
Hill. In front, the unobtrusive sign read 
"Mideastern-American Food." The 
Samera Restaurant. We went up to the 
wooden porch and, with a common hint 
of understanding, opened the door. 

On the left was a dimly lit dining room 
closed off for the afternoon. On the right 
was a small luncheon counter, diminutive 
even for the small room. Behind the 
counter stood a short, square body dressed 
in culinary white and a face squared by 
grizzled hair. 

"So what you want, boys?" 

"We hear you barter in the Mideast." 

"Ah, yes, we still do that there, but not 
here in this country." 

"We couldn't trade for some food?" 

"As I say, we don't barter here in the 
United States-" already, though, he had 
reached for one of my books, "-but what 
do you have?" 

I quickly put into his hand a volume of 
Josephus: Boston, 1823. "This is a history 
of the Jews written in the First Century 
A.D.," I began to explain as he pored over 
the date and the engravings. 

"I am not a Jew, but we read the Scrip-
ture too, you know. What do you want 
for it?" Short pause. 

"A salad?" 

"Good. And what's this?" He was al-
ready paging through Mark Twain, an 
1897 edition. "I think I will take this too." 

He then turned to my friend, who was 
searching through the bag to produce the 
new book, Mathematics, Computers and 
Soviet Economy. "I will take this too, and 
for these three books what do you want?" 

But before we could answer, "I will give 
you each a flying saucer and a salad," he 
said hurriedly. (As the Italians have sub-
marines, he later explained, he has flying 
saucers.) 

"And Arab bread and that dip that goes 
with it?" I asked meekly. 

"That too." 

Shia was his name, a variant of Isaiah. 
Sam Shia. He was a lover of books, he ex-
plained as we dipped the saucer-shaped 
bread into a thick vegetable oil. His grand-
father had translated manuscripts for 
_Schliemann of Troy. The salad was filled 
with chopped mint. 

"I was born in Mesopotamia, but later 
my family moved to Lebanon." He spoke 
of the persecution of his Christian family 
by the Kurds of the northeastern high-
lands. Ne~ertheless, despite his move to 
Lebanon and later to the United States, 
he was still Syrian. Our teeth, meanwhile, 
were tearing at the be.ef and lamb that 
was mashed and packed together with 
spices and tucked into the bread. 

Sam had other customers as well but 
took care to sit and talk when time al-
lowed. Retsina wine he did not have-no 
license- but coffee, milk, coke he did have. 
And did we want dessert? We declined; 
it was mid-afternoon and the Yale lunch 
was too much with us. As we rose to leave 
he promised a full dinner if we brought 
our own wine.
