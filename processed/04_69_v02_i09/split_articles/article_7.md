4. This "further development" is de-
velopment along a path that may lead to 
the overspecialization and extinction of 
the human race. It accepts the dubious 
values of a capitalist Calvinism and con-
ceals assumptions about what constitutes 
higher development that are disastrous 
both for the individual and the species (and 
are rejected by the hippie culture). This 
building up of surplus repression in ever 
higher capacities for intellectualization 
destroys capacities for feeling, for activity, 
for love. Elephantiasis of intellect and 
atrophy of emotion are mirrored in Ameri-
can society, where our intellectual indus- Â· 
try, technology, produces the anti-ballistic 
missile and the death-dealing gadgetry of 
Vietnam while our feelings are too 
atrophied to insist that the logic of our 
priorities is insane. There is the atrophy 
of individual sensation inherent in watch-
ing Johnny Carson, eating Wonder Bread 
and smelling Right Guard. 

These are a few of the attitude-policy 
alternatives that acceptance of the psy-
chologists' findings could lead us to. The 
third and fourth arguments, which would 
appeal to liberals and radicals to varying 
degrees, have in common a disregard for 
the contributions of the lower-middle-
class virtues to what is good as well as what 
is bad in American society. Let us now 
ask whether this disregard is based on 
close analysis of what American society 
would look like if we all possessed the 
"superior" elite values, or whether it is 
the result of an upper-class blindness 
toward what this might mean.

Operant supports of American society, 
conservatives and radicals agree, are very 
different from the formal democratic 
virtues that guarantee the procedures of a 
democratic policy. In the course of a 
brilliant denunciation of some mandarinic 
American political scientists, Noam 
Chomsky quotes de Tocqueville: "I know 
of no country in which there is so little 
independence and freedom of mind as in 
America." Chomsky adds: "Free institu-
tions certainly exist, but a tradition of 
passivity and conformism restricts their 
use-a cynic might say this is why they 
continue to exist." 

Though radicals often condemn Ameri-
can society by juxtaposing the "traditional 
American virtues" of respect for demo-
cratic procedure with current breaches of 
those procedures, it seems probable that 
historically American justice was at least 
as pockmarked as it is today and that the 
lower-middle-class virtues are the real 
"traditional" supports that Tocqueville 
observed when he came to see how Ameri-
can democracy functioned. 

These virtues-law and order morality, 
acceptance of authority, cognitive pro-
cesses that present issues in broad terms, 
ego defenses that prefer the violence of 
hockey to the savagery of the seminar 
table-undoubtedly play a part in whatever 
orderliness there is in daily American 
life. They help people accept and carry 
out decisions that affect them adversely. 
They help make football a high-salience 
issue and foreign affairs a low-salience 
issue, leaving the President, who should 
be in a better position to decide, a good 
ideal of freedom from mass pressures. 

In a number of ways, one could argue, 
they account for what is good as well as 
bad in American life. Conversely, elite 
virtues may account for more of the bad 
aspects of American life than is usually 
assumed. 

Some upper-class radicals, we suggested 
above, are able to assume that elite virtues 
are preferable to lower-middle-class 
virtues across the board because they un-
consciously restrict their idea of who 
should practice these virtues and to what 
end. Radical students and ghetto blacks, 
within limits, are the groups from whom 
these people expect a moral-principle 
orientation rather than law-and-order 
morality. Blacks and students are ex-
pected to practice scepticism toward 
authority. If, on the other hand, the 
colonels, the police, teamsters, longshore-
men or garbage collecters practice p~ 
longed scepticism toward constituted 
authority or act in accordance with their 
principles rather than in accordance with 
law-and-order morality, then the elite 
semi-radicals have a vague sense that 
something must be done. 

The upper class has reached a plateau 
of security from which its liberal-radical 
wing believes that it can mock the politics 
of the policeman and the butcher and 
slight their aspirations while still living 
genteely in the space between them. I re-
caJJ a personal example of how these 
assumptions sometimes work:
