Respectable Bigotry 
by Michael Lerner 
When white Yale students denounce. the 
racist university or racist American so-
ciety, one has little doubt about what they 
refer to. One also has little doubt about 
the political leanings of the speaker. He is 
a good left-liberal or radical, upper-class or 
schooled in the assumptions of upper-class 
liberalism. 

Liberal-to-radical students use these 
phrases and feel purged of the bigotry and 
racism of people such as Chicago's Mayor 
Daley. No one could be further from 
bigotry, they seem to believe, than they. 
But it isn't so. An extraordinary amount 
of bigotry on the part of elite, liberal stu-
dents goes unexamined at Yale and else-
where. Directed at the lower middle class, 
it feeds on the unexamined biases of class 
perspective, the personality predilections 
of elite radicals and academic disciplines 
that support their views. 

There are certainly exceptions in the 
liberal-radical university society-people 
intellectually or actively aware of and op-
posed to the unexamined prejudice. But 
their anomaly and lack of success in 
making an ostensibly introspective com-
munity face its own disease is striking. 

In general, the bigotry of a lower-
middle-class policeman toward a ghetto 
black or of a lower-middle-class mayor 
toward a rioter is not viewed in the same 
perspective as the bigotry of an upper-
middle-class peace matron toward a lower-
middle-class mayor; or of an upper-class 
university student toward an Italian, a Pole 
or a National Guardsman from Cicero, 
Illinois-that is, if the latter two cases are 
called bigotry at all. The violence of the 
ghetto is patronized as it is "understood" 
and forgiven; the violence of a Cicero 
racist convinced that Martin Luther King 
threatens his lawn and house and power-
boat is detested without being understood. 

Ye~ the two bigotries are very similar. For 
one thing, each is directed toward the class 
directly below the resident bigot, the class 
that reflects the dark side of the bigot's 
life. Just as the upper-class recognizes in 
lower-class lace-curtain morality the veiled 
up-tightness of upper-middle-class life, so 
the lower-middle-class bigot sees reflected 
in the lower class the violence, sexuality 
and poverty which threaten him. The 
radical may object that he dislikes the 
lower middle class purely because of its 
racism and its politics. But that is not 
sufficient explanation: Polish jokes are 
devoid of political content.

Empirical studies do not show it, but it 
is my hunch that shortly after negro jokes 
became impossible in elite circles, the 
Polish jokes emerged. They enjoy a con-
tinuing success in universities even today. 
It also happens that while Frank Zappa 
and the Mothers o{ Invention or Janis 
Joplin may vie for top position in the hip 
radical affections, the cellar of their affec-
tions-the object of their ample, healthy, 
appropriate, unneuroticcapacities for 
hatred-is securely in the hands of that 
happy team of Mayor Daley and the Chi-
cago Police. Hip radicals in New 
Haven are often amused by the Italian 
Anti-Defamation League bumper sticker: 
"A.I.D.-Americans of Italian Descent." 

Poles, Italians, Mayor Daley and the 
police are safe objects for amusement, 
derision or hatred. They are all safely 
lower middle class. 

Michael Lerner is a graduate student in 
political science and a contributing editor. 

Part of the vaunted moral development 
of college activists is their capacity for 
empathy-their ability to put themselves in 
the position of the Disadvantaged Other 
and to see the world from hi~ circumstan-
ces. This theoretically leads them to 
empathize with ghetto blacks and there-
fore to distrust the authorities who oppress 
them. Unnoticed goes the fact that the 
"authorities" who get hated are the 
lower-middle-class police, the visible rep-
resentatives of the more abstract and 
ambivalently regarded "power structure." 

Other favored targets for confrontation 
are the National Guard and the military, 
both bastions of the lower middle class. It 
is true that Dow Chemical representatives 
are attacked and that professors and uni-
versity administrators are sometimes held 
captive. It is also true that the police, the 
National Guard and the army are the 
agents of societal racism, student and 
ghetto repression and the war in Vietnam. 
But all these things should not blind us to 
the fact the people toward whom bigotry 
as well as political dislike are directed by 
upper-class radicals are all too frequently 

Radicals gloat over the faulty syntax of 
the lower middle class with the same pre-
dictability that they patronize the ghetto 
language as "authentic." They delight in 
Mayor Daley's malapropisms ("Chicago 
will move on to higher and higher plati-
tudes of achievement") and in the lace-
curtain cynicism of his denunciations: 
"They use language from the bordello, 
language that would shock any decent per-
son." Why do they patronize one authen-
ticity and mock another? 

These upper-class attitudes are not a 
narrow phenomenon. Time, Life and 
Newsweek print ghetto phrases in reverent 
spidery italics-surrounded by space to em-
phasize the authentic simplicity-beneath 
soulful pictures of the cleansing butter-
rible, terrible poverty of ghetto blacks or 
rural poor. They reprint Daley verbatim 
as the fool.

One of the strongest supports for this 
upper-class, "respectable" bigotry lies in 
the academic field of psychology. In much 
of what practitioners choose to investigate 
and interpret, cognitive capacity, moral 
development and psychodynamic organi-
zation of lower middle-class individuals 
are described as inferior to radical 
activities. Lower-middle-class people are 
more "authoritarian," more likely to have 
"closed" minds, more likely to rely on 
"law-and-order morality" rather than the 
more advanced "moral-principle orienta-
tion," and more likely to use "massive" 
ego defenses such as repression instead of 
the more refined defenses like intellec-
tualization and isolation. Lower-middle-
class people are more likely to get stuck 
in a stage of "concrete cognitive opera-
tions" associated with low capacity for 
intellectual differentiation instead of ad-
vancing into "formal cognitive opera-
tions" with its high capacity for abstract 
thinking. 

When George Wallace said his op-
ponent was the kind of man who couldn't 
park a bicycle straight, he undoubtedly 
confirmed for a lot of academic observers 
how concrete and primitive his concept 
of successful intellectual operations was. 

Students in elite universities are de-
scribed by psychologists as possessing 
many of the virtues that lower-middle-
class-authoritarians lack. These scholars 
frequently find that among the elite stu-
dents radical activists have even greater 
moral and intellectual virtues than class-
mates from lower-class or more traditional 
families. If you examine the incidence of 
these virtues, they appear, not surprisingly, 
to cluster. It seems that psychologists 
are measuring something that has con-
nected cognitive, moral and ego-defensive 
manifestations. This something is related 
to class. 

The academic yardsticks measure 
virtues that, as they are defined, appear 
most frequently in the children of 
elite psychologists and their classmates: 
in the children of the upper-middle and 
upper class. 

These virtues do seem to be the con-
sequence of further (though not neces-
sarily higher) development than the virtues 
of the lower middle class; that is, one must 
go through the developmentally prior 
lower-middle-class virtues to reach the elite 
virtues. Repression, obedience to law and 
prompt acceptance of authority are more 
"primitive" ways of dealing with reality 
than intellectualization, reflection on prin-
ciples before obeying a law, and scepti-
cism toward authority. One psychologist 
has urged that upper-class virtues are 
better in a Platonic sense than lower-
middle-class virtues. It is revealing that he 
does not recall that Plato would undoubt-
edly have restricted the practice of upper-
class virtues to the upper class in his city, 
arguing that in the interest of harmony 
other virtues must be required of the lower 
classes. 

Should we believe that the psychologists 
have discovered an empirical basis for 
distinguishing between more and less de-
veloped men? Should we believe that the 
developed men are superior? We can start 
with two broad possibilities. Either "fur-
ther development" is the artifact of 
class blindness, and upper-class develop-
ment is merely different from lower-class 
development; or upper-class development 
is subsequent to lower class development. 
I think the weight of the argument sug-
gests the latter. 

If we opt for this possibility, we must 
then ask whether the further development 
is an achievement or a degeneration. Since 
this depends on our societal values, further 
choice is required: we can either compare 
directly the values of the further-devel-
oped individual with the formal societal 
values or we can ask whether the survival 
of the formal societal values is enhanced 
by increasing the number of people whose 
personal values are similar to the formal 
values of the society. 

This question forces us to be more 
specific about what we mean by the super-
iority of elite virtues in comparison with 
the virtues of the lower middle class. 

Recent analysts, lacking Plato's grasp of 
behavioral data and his rigorous em-
piricism, have been unrealistically ideal-
istic in considering the consequences of 
changing a class distribution of virtues. 
That elite virtues are superior, Plato saw, 
does not mean that the society would be 
better or would even survive if all pos-
sessed them. 

It may be that the lower-middle-class 
virtues provide operant support for a 
society that allows the upper class the 
luxury of elite virtues, much as Greek 
democracy was built on slave labor. I 
stress "operant support for American 
society" rather than "formal support of 
democracy" because the lower middle 
class is frequently denounced for dis-
regarding formal democratic values such 
as regard for due process and for such 
freedoms as conscience, press, expression 
and movement. 

Those who acclaim the elite radical 
virtues as superior to the virtues of the 
lower middle class would appear, if one 
admits that lower-class virtues provide 
operant support for American society, to 
have three alternatives. They can accept 
the distribution as necessary and good, 
in which case they espouse a troublesome 
elitism that cannot be reconciled with their 
radical views. Or they can argue that 
everyone should possess these virtues, in 
which case they are true radicals and 
should ask themselves whether they have 
considered in an unbiased light the im-
plications of this position. Or they can do 
what I think most people do, which is 
largely to restrict-without admitting or 
even being conscious of the restriction-
the practice of these superior virtues to 
the upper class. 

The self-serving argument for upper-
class hegemony then seems to be that the 
upper class is more intelligent, more moral 
and more finely tuned in its ego defenses 
than the lower class and that this makes 
it more fit to govern and to preserve such 
democratic values as equal access. But in 
the name of the preservation of these 
values, elite virtues must be denied to the 
lower class because their use would be 
disruptive. To preserve the society that 
guarantees access to power to those who 
are virtuous, we must deny the possession 
of virtue to the lower class and thus deny 
the access we are theoretically preserving. 

Leaving aside the hard choices that a 
believer in the superiority of radical 
virtues must make, we can ask in broader 
perspective what alternative stances one 
may take if it is true that an upper-class 
background leads to further moral and 
intellectual development. They appear 
to be: 

1. In the existing world a "further 
developed" man may govern worse rather 
than better. A principled orientation can 
be disastrous in world politics, as the 
principled architects of the Cold War 
have shown. An ability to empathize may 
lead to concessions in negotiation that 
will be misread by the Other Side as 
blanket willingness to retreat when faced 
with force. Capacity to see issues in all 
their complexity may lead to Hamlet-
like paralysis when any action would be 
preferable to none. 

2. The further development of the 
upper class might make it best qualified 
to rule, as its de facto supremacy proves. 
In a roughly democratic framework there 
is a chance for the few lower-class in-
dividuals who achieve upper-class virtues 
to rise to the top; that most leaders will 
be upper class by birth is necessary and 
even desirable to preserve social stability 
and to reduce the anxieties that result 
from situations of volatile status change. 

3. Upper-class individuals are further 
developed than lower-class individuals, 
and it is an indictment of our resource-
rich society that more people are not 
brought into these higher stages of de-
velopment. Analyses claiming that this 
would destabilize society are too contin-
gent to win credence; the destabilization, 
moreover, might result in a better society 
instead of a worse one.
