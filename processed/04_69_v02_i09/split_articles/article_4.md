The Law School will never 
be home again 
by Richard Balzer 

I went to lunch at the Law School one day 
in November and heard that Eugene 
Rostow was returning to teach two courses 
for the spring term. We talked for a while 
about how we should welcome him back. 
I must admit none of the suggestions were 
very complimentary. Yet somehow it is 
April now, Rostow has been back for 
nearly three months, and there has been 
little one could point to as a reaction to 
his return. 

Even though some students have con-
tinued to talk of boycotting his classes or 
disrupting them, none of this talk has been 
turned into action. In fact, the only organ-
ized student response to his return has 
been a Rostow Brothers Film Festival, in 
which three movies showing Vietnam 
atrocities and severely attacking American 
policy were shown. Before the event, all 
was quiet. It was only afterwards, in a rare 
moment when Rostow lost his composure 
and tore down one of the posters, that the 
stu(lents reacted. A sign was posted imitat-
ing the rhetoric of an announcement Dean 
Pollak had recently posted when the Black 
Law Students' Union bulletin board had 
been torn down. It read, 

It has come to our attention that, during the 
course of the past few days, certain of the 
posters announcing the Rostow Brothers Film 
Festival have been rent from the ivied walls 
of our ihstitution. Now, while we are secure in 
our pious belief that no member of the greater 
Yale Law School Community can have been 
the perpetrator of this cowardly and craven 
act of petty and unmitigated hooliganism and 
vandalism, it is nevertheless incumbent upon 
us in all our Contemporary Relevance suit-
ably to deplore this attack against the very 
core of our Democratic Ideals, that Judaeo-
Christian, Anglo-American Common-Law, 
one-man-one-vote Constitutional philosophi-
cal heritage, which we cherish in our hearts 
and foster in our studies. It 1s earnestly urged 
that cooler heads will prevail in this poten-
tially critical time and that no one group, 
neither first-year class nor faculty, will take 
the Law into its own hands, thereby sullying 
and polluting its righteousness and debasing 
itself to that nadir reached by those con-
temptuous and meddlesome outside agitating 
wretches, who have so recently and so 
grievously shocked us all. 

Pe~haps, however, the lack of an extreme 
response can point us to a deeper concern: 
the malaise which currently exists at the 
Law School and the strange fascination 
with-and courting of-power by future 
leaders. To say that a malaise exists which 
affects the Law School's reaction to Ros-
tow is to believe that at some other time 
there would have been a more extreme re-
action to his return. I think that two years 
ago, and even last year at the beginning of 
the McCarthy campaign, a more extreme 
and negative response to Rostow's return 
would have occurred. This is not to say 
that such a response would have been 
proper or the best tactic, but only that 
there would have been a much stronger 
need to react. 

The Law School is a microcosm of 
the liberal community, which rightly or 
wrongly believes in its most hopeful 
moments that settling the Vietnam war is 
no longer an ideological struggle but an 
administrative issue-or in its sadder 
moments believes that there is little that 
can be done to alter the course of the 
war. Somehow student opposition to 
Vietnam policy, though probably more

the Yale Law School. 
widespread now than ever before, is at its 
quietest. I don't mean to be hard on my 
colleagues, but there is little discussion 
about the war. It is an uncomfortable 
topic, one which somehow leads nowhere. 
Large numbers of students either actively 
or passively avoid discussing Vietnam. 

No matter how removed Rostow was 
from the decisions, he is popularly seen 
as a policy-maker who actively supported 
the Johnson policy. With little remaining 
appetite for Vietnam, it is not suprising 
that students seem less than eager to con-
front one of the policy-makers of the war. 

Some students, however, would claim 
that there is no need for an organized 
reaction. They contend that if Rostow is 
ignored he will be a lonely man, a man 
whom history forgets, a man who will do 
his thing off in a corner. I think they are 
wrong. In many ways the former dean 
is disarmingly warm, engaging and ideal-
istic, and be is a man whom I might have 
liked under different circumstances. But 
when he says there hasn't yet been written 
a defensible piece of opposition to the war, 
then all my emotional hostility and frus-
tration about Vietnam and its policy-mak-
ers returns. Such comments quickly 
convince one that Rostow is inflexible 
about the war. He is convinced of his 
position and his. assumption~ and there-
fore is willing to engage students and 
even take the initiative in a discussion of 
the issue. Like others, I find discussing 
the war with him nearly impossible. To 
control one's rage in order to maintain a 
"rational discussion" is difficult. 

More important, however, is that re-
gardless of Rostow's departure from 
Washington, the policie$ he supported 
both in his work and even more vivid!y 
in his recent book, Law, Power and the 
Pursuit of Peace, will not soon disappear 
from our foreign relations. The policies he 
would encourage us to follow may have 
proved unworkable in Vietnam, but it 
would be naive to believe that they will 
soon be abandoned. Statements like the 
following are not only dangerous but 
seem likely to remain in the rhetoric of our 
foreign policy: 

But the decisive element in American concern 
about Vietnam is resistance to the bleak. fact 
with which President Johnson lived every day 
Â·of his term: the fact that the protection of our 
national security requires not a sprint, a one-
shot effort, followed by the relief of a with-
drawal, but a permanent involvement in the 
politics of every part of the globe, based on a 
strategy of peace that seeks to achieve order 
and to make progress possible. (Law, Power 
and the Pursuit of Peace, p. 55) 

The Law School's malaise-whatever its 
causes-only partially explains the response 
to Rostow. Several students have taken his 
courses, and at least one student, less timid 
in his concern and fascination with power, 
invited him to a dinner party, while others 
actively seek him out in less formal ways. 
Even some of those who abhor his politics 
would like to understand them better. 

Whether it is true or not, people at the 
Law School believe that they-or at least 
people they have met there-will someday 
be powerful. Talk is often heard about 
this person or that being destined to be-
come a senator. The students at the Yale 
Law School are on the make and, more 
than most students, are fascinated with 
power and powerful people. Whatever his 
qualities and politics, Eugene Rostow was 
and may be still a politically powerful per-
son. A number of students could not care 
less about the substance of his politics.
