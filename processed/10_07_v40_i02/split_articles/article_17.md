"Best Video?" Daniel's silver name tag 
catches the fluorescent lighting as he watches a customer 
shuffle out of Blockbuster into a drizzly October night, Blood Diamond in hand. ''Yeah, I know Best Video. It's up in Hamden." 

Ortiz, who finished high school and then started at Blockbuster 
"I like movies" 
is 22, with a fuzz of black beard, patchy in 
places, and the pale skin of a horror film devotee. (All-time favorites: Audition, The Exorcist, Fridqy the 1J'h.) ''Anytime someone comes 
in here asking for tapes, I send 'em there." He nods towards the seven thousand tape-free titles that fill·Blockbuster's aisles. "They're 
like the last bastion of VHS. They're still holdin' on." 

Best Video holds on in a quiet Hamden neighborhood tucked between downtown New Haven and strip-mall sprawl. Victorian-

style houses with trim lawns sandwich the 
store, and the closest other businesses are 
Walgreens ~nd Dairy Queen. Other than 
the name's claim, etched in red letters on 
a white sign, and the small, perpetually-
packed parking lot, nothing seen from 
the road intimates what lies within. 

Far from Blockbuster's light-up sign, 
on the same October night, a smattering 
of customers wanders through the aisles 
of Best Video's thirty thousand films. 
Section headings are a movie lover's 
dream. They range from the serious-
by director (Visconti, Bill Forsyth, Mel 
Brooks), 
by 
country 
(Argentinean, 
Balkan, · Cuban) 
to 
normative 
(Best Comedy, Best Low Budget, Best 
Oscar Losers) 
to the whimsical (Weird 
'60s, Fantasy Adventure, Sexploitation, 
Godzilla). 

Hank Paper, the founder and owner 
of Best Video whose sharp, vaguely 
mischievous face appears sketched on 
the orange "Hank's Pick" stickers that 
dot hundreds of DVD cases 
recalls a 
favorite anecdote: ''A group of Russians 
that came here once said there were more 
Russian films in the Russian section than 
in all of Moscow." (There are 144.) 

Since Hank opened Best Video with 
five hundred movies in 1984 ("it wasn't 
large in quantity," he says, "but deep in 
interest"), New Haven area residents 
have had two options for renting 
movies: Blockbuster and Best Video. 
But cookie-cutter operations have never 
threatened Hank's local gem. Leaving the 
wildly knowledgeable staff, astounding 
selection, and quirky personality of Best 
Video for a sterile wall of New Releases 
is like descending from cinephile Heaven 
to some big-budget purgatory. 

In the last few years, however, a bull 
has wandered into this small-town china 
shop. "This place has the atmosphere of 
an old New York bookstore," another 
employee named Hank H., the "other" 
Hank, tells me one afternoon. "It's a 
throwback." I nod, and feel the need to 
assure him my family has always been a 
Best Video member. ''It's important for 
people to realize," he conrinues, "'~at you 
can't get a sense of community without 
community ga~ering places." True. But 
this invocation of community space is a 
newer, subtler justification of Best Video's 
existence than the classic, underdog 
idealism of many small businesses. 

"So ... " I finally vepture, "Do you 
think some people have stopped coming 
to Best Video because of N etflix?" His 
warm face tightens for a moment. "Oh. 
Yeah. Definitely." I don't ask how many. 

ike, a big guy with a gray, scraggly 
ud and a puppy-dog smile, has 
worked at Best Video since he "put the 
first barcodes" on the first video boxes. 
In his spare time, Mike writes "The Black 
Maria," a blog named after Thomas 
Edison's first film studio. "They would 
turn the whole thing around to catch 
the sun," he explains of the studio, still 
amazed. "The entire thing was all covered 
in tar paper, and the ceiling would open 
to let in the light." Like Mike, most Best 
Video staffers know the minutiae of film 
history, or at least their favorite strains of 
it, inside and out. 

But Best Video itself is part of a 
different historical narrative: the short 
but ever-evolving story of how America 
consumes movies. When Hank Paper 
opened Best Video in 1984, VHS tapes, 
and the stores that rented them, were 
novelties. "I hear there are these places 
called video stores cropping up," Hank's 
father told him as his screenwriting career 
in Hollywood lost steam. "Why don't you 
check it out?" 

"The transition from Hollywood to 
private consumption was revolutionary," 
explains 
Richard, 
Best Video's no-
nonsense business manager. "25, 26, 27 
years ago, if you missed Casablanca in the 
movie theaters 
that was it." In the early 
'80s, major movie studios tried to ban 
VCRs by claiming~ copyright violation, 
incensed at a development that would, 
without doubt, permanently alter the role 
of the cinema in American life. They 
failed, and Best Video opened. "Young 
people take it for granted," Richard 
continues. "They watch DVDs on their 
computers and think nothing of it." 

etflix is a boon for discriminating 
movie lovers in the sticks. "The 
subscription has revolutionized our lives," 
Bill T. Jones, choreographer and director, 
volunteered recently to the New York 
Times Magazine about his TV-watching 
habits. 
''We've been having a kind of 
French-film festival around here lately.
