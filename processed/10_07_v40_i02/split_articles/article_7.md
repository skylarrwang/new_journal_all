THE 
INVITATION, 
PRINTED 
ON 
CREAM-
colored cardstock, advised us to gather 
in the Calhoun Common Room no later 
than 4:45. By 4:50, four undergraduate 
Eliza Doolittles in need of cutlery skills 
had waridered in: a strapping lad in jeans 
and a white polo shirt, two gentlemen in 
slacks and white button-down shirts, and 
a young lady sporting undersized cotton 
athletic .shorts and high-heeled flip-
flops. By five o'clock, the flock had filled 
out. A door swung open, and we were 
herded into a small room adjacent to the 
. 
-
dining hall by a venerable representative 
of 
Undergraduate 
Career 
Services' 
Employer-in-Residence program. Dining 
Etiquette 101, or "Tine-Counting for 
I-Bankers," was about to begin. No 
one commented on the irony inherent 
in attempting to teach proper dining 
etiquette next to an actual dining hall. 
I settled into a chair and surveyed 
the scene: three tables covered in white 
cloth, crowded with 25 place-settings-
each with a knife, a spoon, two forks, 
and three glasses, all more or less clean 
and in working condition. I perused the 
two-page handout on "Eating Etiquette" 
(Rule One: ''Dress for the occasion") 
and eyed the high-heeled flip-flopper 
with contempt. But before I could read 
further, I was assaulted by a wave of sickly 
sweet cologne. A genial fellow with long, 
bushy, blond hair, flushed cheeks, and 
loud, checked capri pants was hovering 
over my right shoulder. Eager to impress 
me with his homegrown (and, as I later 
learned, Hungarian) manners, he bowed 
low and asked if he "might" sit. I opened 
my notebook, noted his untraceable 
accent, and nodded politely. 

While seats were filling, he giggled 
excitedly over the etiquette guidelines. 
At first it was all fun and games (Rules 
Four, Nine, and Eleven boil down to the 
same sentiment: "Having a non-alcoholic 
beverage is a perfecdy. good option"). But 
then, disaster. Rule Five: "Be sure to leave 
one hand free. for shaking hands or eating. 
You can do this by using all the fingers 
and palm of your other hand. Fold your 
napkin loosely around your litde finger. 
Balance the hors d'oeuvre plate between 
your ring and middle fingers, and hold 
your glass or cup between your index 
finger and thumb." The laughter died on 
his lips: Tentatively poking the napkin 
protruding from the glass in front of him 
with his pinky finger, he turned to me, 
crestfallen. Not wanting to remove the 
napkin . mainly in the spirit of Rule Six: 
''Wait to go in to dinner or sit down until 
either your host(s) say to sit or until they 
are seated." 
I mimed an explanation. 
''Don't worry," I told him, pointing to the 
rule's last line, "It even says here, 'It takes 
a litde practice."' 

The workshop proper began with 
some preliminary remarks from the self-
appointed Henry Higgins of flatware 
(in reality, Catherine Stebinger), who 
frequently interrupted herself to correct 
our already objectionable manners. Two 
would-be hedge fund managers were 
sharply chastised for wearing baseball 
caps; they nodded contritely but kept their 
hats on. Tongue-lashing over, we were 
asked to file into the dining hall proper so 
that we could swipe our ID cards. Only 
then did I realize that our faux business 
dinner, served by an embarrassingly 
obsequious dining hall employee-cum-
waiter, would be served with a side of 
signature 
Calhoun 
Caribbean 
Blend 
vegetables. They were, as usual, soggy. 

During the salad course, the first of 
several governing metaphors revealed 
itself: business dinner as obstacle course. 
We .didn't so much use what was on the 
table as navigate around it. Passing the 
bread basket proved to be the equivalent 
of successfully crossing a thirty-foot 
• • 
balance log during the fifth week of boot 
camp. That danger overcome, a thirsty 
girl nervously raised her hand: "I have a 
question. How _ do we drink our water?" 
Answer: you just do. "How do you mix 
your salad nicely?" asked another clueless 
diner. Answer: you don't. I looked down 
at my own plate and realized that the 
couscous atop my lettuce violated Rule 
Eight ("If you are ordering from a 
restaurant menu, avoid food that w]U drip 
or slip"). I ate around it. After all, I didn't 
want to look, in Ms. Stebinger's words, 
"dirty." 

The 
"waiter" 
came 
around 
to 
pour the "red wine" (Kool-Aid). The 
Hungarian was enthusiastic about Rule 
Ten (''Whoever orders the wine will 
have a small amount poured into the 
glass to taste. Smell it delicately, sip it, 
rolling it around on your tongue, then 
swallow. Unless it tastes like vinegar, 
nod your head and say something like, 
'Excellent!' or 'Very Good."'), He sipped, 
swirled, and swallowed. It tasted more 
.like flavored sugar water than vinegar. 
He excitedly proclaimed it "Excellent!" 
He had harkened to a casual warning of 
Ms. Stebinger's, one that struck me as an 
appropriate mantra 
for the workshop, 
for a postgraduate future in the business 
world: ''You want to accept a lot of what's 
happening unless it's actually going to be 
harmful." Around the table, the future 
employees 
of G6ldrnan-Sachs 
were 
drinking the Kool-Aid. 

The main course established a second 
fundamental principle: eat, as Scarlett 
O'Hara would say, like a bird. We were 
told, first verbally and then through 
an energetic demonstration, to butter 
our bread and cut our meat one bite at 
a time: with fork in left hand, and knife 
in right hand, cut one piece; set knife 
down at four o'cl~ck; switch fork to .right 
hand; spear bite; eat; repeat. Above all, 
mouthfuls were to be kept small. A thin 
girl asked what a diner should do if she 
wasn't particularly hungry. Considering 
the pace of the cutting-switching-biting 
routine, I was more preoccupied with 
. what an interviewee should do if she were 
hungry. By this point, we had been sitting 
primly for over thirty minutes and had

**Patriotic Cakes and Political Statements**
**Page number(s): 5-6**

THE GUIDELINES WERE SIMPLE: "CAKE BASE 
may be made of Styrofoam and measure 
not more than 12" high. Decorate cake 
depicting patriotism theme and include 
a name card listing your entry." The 
rules read, the task clear, the ingredients 
purchased, amateur bakers from around 
the state revved up their KitchenAid 
mixers and set their sights on the 
fairgrounds in Durham, Connecticut. 

There are over 45 fairs in the state 
of Connecticut, but the Association of 
Connecticut Fairs considers Durham's 
to be one of the 
year's greatest. 
Complete with livestock and agricultural 
competitions, 
~arnival 
rides, 
and 
concession stands b · 
· g with fried, 
sugar-coated artery-assailants, this year's 
event reported a total of 12,844 registered 
October 2007 
exhibits. In certain divisions, · baking 
included, a blue ribbon at the Durham 
fair is your ticket to compete at the state 
contest in November. Envisioning the 
daunting pool of diehard competitors, I 
steered clear of the prestigious apple· pie 
contest. The whimsical Patriotic Cake 
division seemed more at my level. 

A few days later, the apartment glittered 
with red sugar, an edible pixie dust that 
settled on everything within a ten-foot 
radius of the kitchen. My favorite t-shirt 
was spangled with blue food coloring as I 
dispensed Crest-colored frosting to form 
an All-American bustier on a Barbie doll's 
plastic chest. A small crowd of onlookers 
was dusted in flour and sprinkles. "The 
last time I thought about edible clothing," " 
one commented, "it wasn't in. such a 
wholesome context.'' 

Events more wholesome and less 
nutritious than the baking contest at the 
Durham Fair are hard to come by. In 
keeping with the "Patriotic" theme of 
the decorated cake division, Barbie was 
to be the star of my "Miss America" 
masterpiece. So while my friends sat 
across from me at the kitchen table, one 
editing his Rhodes application and the 
other grappling with a physics problem 
set, I played culinary Barbie doll dress-up. 
Considering all of the feminist articles 
and polls that seem determined to 
expose latent domestic wannabes among 
undergrads, I was surprised that no one 
worried I was neglecting more serious 
work. 

Yet the creative process of cake 
design was more challenging than I had 
anticipated. With self-righteous scorn at 
the notion of a Styrotoam base, I had 
immediately ruled out anything but 100 
percent made-from-scratch cake. But my 
creative impulses exhausted themselves 
shortly after I settled on a general red, 
white and blue color scheme, and I sought 
inspiration from friends. 
''You should make a cake in the shape 
of an SUV," one suggested. An informal 
survey of Yale students involving free 
association of the words "patriotism" and 
"cake" resulted in predictably political 
replies: Bush's head as a pound cake, red 
and blue states on a beet cake map, a 
mosaic of brand name commodities. At 
the suggestion of "something to do with 
obesity," however, I rea1ized that activism 
would not be the right ingredient when 
winning a baking contest was at stake. 

When I was growing up, the annual 
Independence Day picnic in North 
Haven, . Maine featured a bring-your-
own-dessert table where tasty treats were 
exchanged for free watermelon, hot dogs 
and other American standards. The one 
rule of the dessert table was that no one 
could dig in until12:30 on the dot. A sun-
bonneted older wom::tn guarded a kitchen 
timer that ticked off the minutes. At the 
sound of the bell, we converged upon 
the coveted goodies like vultures. Ding! 
Inspiration hit at the recollection of 
my seventh birthday doll cake 
Barbie 
donned a fashionably frosted "red velvet" 
dress. Reincarnated as "Miss America," a 
similar cake could be a lighthearted take 
on the patriotic theme, and perhaps just 
technically challenging enough to catch 
the eye of the judges. 

The Durham Fair's criteria for judging 
a decorated cake are based on a hundred-
point scale. Creative Theme, fifty; Color 
Blending, 25; Decorating Technique, 25. 
Taste and texture didn't count, which was 
lucky, since I had forgotten to add vanilla 
to my batter. No one ever clarified what 
"color blending" involved. I can only 
speculate that I got away with raspberry-
colored (rather than true red) trim on 
the three-tiered dress because frosting 
is inevitably tinted pink when forming 
a Barbie's outfit. I had also aspired to 
either a bright ultramarine or regal Yale 
blue, but discovered that adding drop 
after drop of blue dye only increased its 
dn1lness. Eventually, I had to settle for a 
faded denim color. 

Among the eleven entries in the 
Patriotic Decorated Cake category, five 
featured American flags, two supported 
the 
military, 
one 
sported 
sculpted 
miniatures of hot dogs, baseballs and 
apple pie, and another imitated a ballot 
box, implore us to ''VO'IE!" Mine wasn't 
the only cake donning a doll. One of 
my competitors dressed ''Betsy Ross" 
in fondant icing so smooth it looked 
like 
porcelain. 
A 
handwritten 
note 
rested near Bets 's apron, ''In honor of 
those who do what they can at home." 
A simple, perfectly-executed three:..layer 
cake sprouting stars like tinsel won Best 
of Show. 

First-place ribbons went to cakes with 
5 


a cause, second to those that celebrated a 
specific aspect of American culture, and 
third to the remainder. If my cake had a 
cause, I'm not sure exactly what it was. 
Though I had briefly agonized over the 
ethnicity and hair color of my Barbie, I 
ultimately bought a safely blonde-and-
blue-eyed gal with the least excessive 
amount of painted makeup. If only to 
appease a faint tug of collegiate rebellion, 
I pulled together a mild political statement 
by constructing a candy crinoline of Dum-
.Dum lollipops around the base of the 
cake. Barbie scintillated in a homemade · 
sash and a makeshift crown of jeweled 
bobby-pins; I came away with a second-
place ribbon.
