Ufysses fan finds~home in play.
By
uraYao
orne years ago, in late December, a little boy of four confided in his mother that he knew where his Christmas present had
come from. "It came from Santa Claus," he said. His mother was amused. ''And how do you know that?" she asked. The boy
answered, "I saw it in his shop."
Richard Stack laughs
a great, hiccupping sound
as he tells the story in his mild English accent. Though the toy store owner's
physique
his windswept white hair, his lively laugh, his Clausian girth
certainly invites the comparison, he doesn't encourage it.
He's never worn a red suit for the holidays, and he flatly refuses to carry seasonal toys in his store because, in his own, delicate words,
''You go to the drugstqre for that shit."
The Toystore on Audubon, known to regular customers as "Richard's Place," is crammed floor-to-ceiling with neon plush and
plastics. Stack's desk, which also serves as a checkout counter, is shoved into a corner and buried under an old PC and tumbling piles
of paper. The disheveled man with an uncensored sense of humor seems incongruous among the frilly dolls and brightly colored
building blocks. He's constantly knocking things over as he lumbers through the aisles, but he remains nonplussed. "Do you know
how often that happens in this store?" he asks no one in particular, as a stand of hand puppets crashes to the floor behind him. The
jungle of toys gives the place a certain flair, but Stack insists that the chaos is not by design. "I am, I confess, no businessman at all,"
he says. "Business is a pain in the ass."
