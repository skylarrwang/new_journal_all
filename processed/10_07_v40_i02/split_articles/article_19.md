or 
over 
an . hour, · Michael 
Fernandez '07 tries to describe 
why he won't go to Cuba. "It's like 
going to South Africa in the high part 
of Apartheid," he finally- says, finding 
the words to describe his conviction. "I 
would be contributing to sustaining a 
tyrannical _government. I wouldn't travel 
there." 
Fernandez's great-grandfather was 
stripped of eve 
· g he owned by 
Castro's regime. His grandmother fled 
Cuba for the United States thirty years 
ago. Fernandez refuses to forgive a 
government that continues to restrict 
the press, ban most private enterprise, 
and throw dissidents in jail. He echoes 
generations of Cuban exiles who have 
argued that any and all travel to Cuba 
bolsters 
the 
authoritarian 
regime. 
"Everything you spend contributes to the 
oppression of the people," Fernandez 
explains. "The money ends up in the 
hands of the state." 
This argument goes far in the United 
States. The economic embargo against 
Cuba has remained intact for nearly 
fifty years. President Clinton loosened 
restrictions on travel to Cuba for students 
and academics, artists, members of the 
clergy, and Cuban-Americans with family 
on the island. In 2004, however, Bush 
issued controversial guidelines restricting 
Cuban-Americans' family visits from 
once a year to once every three years. 
Less politicized but equally stringent 
were the President's restrictions on 
academic travel. 
Under the current 
• 
guidelines, 
undergraduates may visit 
Cuba only as independent researchers 
conducting work for a course, and must 
stay for a minimum of ten weeks. Class 
trips are banned. In 2001, sixty thousand 
undergraduates traveled to Cuba. That 
number has dwindled to well below 
one hundred. Yale is one of the few 
institutions that continues to send its 
students to th~. socialist state. 
Michael Bustamante traveled to Cuba 
· 2005, during the summer before 
his senior year. The things he carried were 
. . 
largely determined by necessity. Among 
the necessities or near necessities were a 
few thousand Canadian dollars in cash, 
an entire suitcase of antibiotics, cough 
syrup, toilet paper, and Pep to-Bismol,

a letter signed by his Yale advisor, and 
a copy of Yale's Treasury Department 
license permitting academic travel to 
Cuba. He carried Canadian cash because 
U.S. dollars are subject to a ten percent 
penalty when exchanged for the Cuban 
convertible peso. He carried an extra 
suitcase stuffed with toiletries because he 
knew he would have to share the wealth. 
He carried the letter from his advisor and 
the copy of Yale's license to demonstrate 
that his travel to Cuba was legal. 
Bustamante's 
letter 
verified 
his 
enrolhnent in an undergraduate degree 
program at Yale University. It confirmed 
the dates during which he would conduct 
research for a structured Yale course, and 
stated that he was traveling to Cuba under 
U.S. Treasury Department License No. 
October 2007 
CT-9259. The license, obtained by Yale 
Associate General Counsel Harold Rose, 
invests the Universi!_:y with the authority 
to approve research projects, and allows 
Yale students who meet the regulations to 
make travel-related transactions in Cuba. 
Lillian Guerra, an assistant professor 
of history who 
specializes in the 
Caribbean and advises the vast majority 
of undergraduates conducting research 
in Cuba, speculates that under twenty 
institutions now hold the academic 
license. The license must be renewed 
every year, and can easily be withheld 
by the Department of the Treasury. For 
example, in 2005, Harvard lost its license 
for 18 months. 
The Cuban government also erects 
barriers. Before students jet off to the 
island, they must obtain a Cuban research 
visa, which grants access to any Cuban 
academic institution and legalizes study in 
a country that often equates research with 
espionage. "If you don't have a research 
visa," Guerra warns, "it is criminal, and 
you can get deported." 
Students 
must 
meet 
rigorous 
regulations 
and 
obtain 
independent 
funding to receive Yale's endorsement. 
One such student, junior Gerald McElroy, 
studied the Cuban media's portrayals 
of the United States as a crime-ridden, 
marijuana-smokingcesspoolcharacterized 
by extreme racism and cold-hearted, 
capitalist murder. McElroy understood 
the need for tact when dealing with 
sooalist regimes. On his application for a 
Cuban research visa, McElroy proposed a
