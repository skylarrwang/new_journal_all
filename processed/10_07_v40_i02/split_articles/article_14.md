Andrea Rankins has worked in the Say-
brook dining hall for ten· years. 
co-d.i.rector, is all smiles and as she talks 
about celebrity chef Jacques Pepin training 
Yale chefs in 2004 or about YSFP's lofty 
goals of community and "incredibly good 
food." But when asked about introducing 
these goals to an 
<.-run Dining 
Services, she speaks slowly, carefully. 
'~nytime you shift a vision, it's going 
to be . challenging~" Shannon-DiPietro 
says. '~d A 
. 
RI<. central was not 
reinforcing the values we were trying to 
institute at Yale." 

As Yale has been at the vanguard · 
of sustainable institutional dining for 
the past six years, it is no surprise that 
took a while to catch up. 

For a corporation at the forefront of 
the outsourcing movement, the idea of 
prioritizing sustainable farming practices 
over bottom-line prices must have seemed 
a bit counterintuitive. 

As YSFP's influence spread beyond the 
Berkeley dining hall to every kitchen at Yale, 
both the University and 
staff 
were forced to adapt to new perspectives 
on purchasing and cooking food. YSFP 
traveled to Philadelphia for annual Dining 
Services staff training sessions at the 
headquarters. 
Shannon-
DiPietro says 
and YSFP 
split up training duties according to their 
respective strengths, with 
taking a larger role in management training 
and YSFP in food preparation. YSFP gave 
instructions on how to prepare seasonable 
items and taught cooks to taste food while 
preparing it 
"it's actUally really important 
to taste food before you serve it," Shannon-
DiPietro says with a laugh. 

YSFP's raw energy and momentum, 
which has remained in step with a national 
trend toward organic and sustainable 
restaurants, grocery stores, and farms, 
gave Yale's Dining Services a much-needed 
jolt. Even before YSFP arrived, Huff 
says, Dining Services had realized that it 
needed to step up its focus on food quality, 
but its partnership with . ARAMARI<. 
did not provide many · opportunities for 
mnovatl.on. 

''When ·YSFP ·came along," Huff 
says, "I felt the support and creativity for 
that, and the energy behind that, was not 
ARAMARK." Despite initial challenges, 
YSFP's values quickly infiltrated Dining 
Services. Prior to the 2006-2007 school 
year, Dining Services rewrote its entire 
menu, including non-YSFP items. ''We 
thought, 'Why focus only on quality as 
defined by YSFP?"' Huff remembers. 

Eventually, Dining Services felt that, 
due both 
to · A 
RK's 
financial 
management 
and 
YSFP's 
culinary 
leadership, it was time to return to a self-
operated system. "Dining Services had 
gotten to a certain level," Huff explains. 
" 
RK. had contributed greatly to 
ustazna 
zs 
never 
will be YSFP recipes." In September of 
this year, the number of these items was 
expanded to stock four meals per week, 
but transition-related budget concerns 
brought this trial to a temporary halt. In 
anticipation of a new, self-operated Dining 
Services, Huff told the Yale Dai!J News, 
he and his colleagues must be prudent in 
balancing cost and quality. 

ale's reincarnated dining system is 
still waiting for its leader. Yale has 
hired OPUS International, a Philadelphia 
headhunting firm, to conduct a national 
search for a new executive director of 
Dining Services. Six ·candidates visited 
campus at the beginning of October, Huff 
reports, and the search committee hopes 
to make a final decision by Thanksgiving. 

Until this decision is made, it is hard to 
predict the precise direction a self-operated 
Dining Services will take. 

'When I think of what Dining Services 
needs 
right 
now," 
Shannon-DiPietro 
says, ''I think of a really dynamic Dining 
Services leader." 

Both 
she 
Huff 
stress 
the 
importance of an executive director who 
balances effective, efficient management 
with good food. Now that Yale University 
Dining 
Services, 
like 
thousands of 
national corporations, is 
shifting its

institution 
to 
e

this level, but I wasn't convinced they were 
going to take us much further than we 
already we:re." 

Huff is determined to maintain an 
independen~ high-quality Dining Services 
that will work in conjunction with YSFP to 
bring aspects of the local and sustainable 
food movement to the Yale campus. 

YSFP has made impressive strides in the 
past years, introducing organic honey 
and yogurt and fair trade coffee, bananas, 
and chocolate, as well as one all-YSFP 
meal per week, in all of Yale's residential 
colleges, and Huff sees this expansion as 
an ongoing Dining Services /YSFP effort. 

Huff says he can see where the Food 
Project is going. 'We're going to agree 
on some percent of the menu items that 
priorities from cost-culling to ethical and 
sustainable business practices, experience 
with sustainability and food preparation is 
invaluable in a leader. Huff wants someone 
who is not only a manager but also a food-
lover. He and Shannon-DiPietro, both 
heavily involved in the search process, have 
been extremely pleased with the candidates 
so far. Once Yale appoints a new head of 
Dining Services and 
officially 
departs, Yale dining will have to decide 
just how financially sustainable sustainable 
food can be. 


As Shannon-DiPietro and her co-
director, Josh Viertel, are well aware, 
sustainability is increasingly trendy, and 
Yale, never an institution to be left in 
the dust, has taken note. In 2004, the


University appointed its first susta1nability 
director. One year later, it created the 
Office of Sustainability 
recently moved 
to an environmentally-conscious space 
equipped with "daylight tubes," motion-
sensor lights, and reclaimed wood floors,-
to coordinate the University's efforts in 
renewable energy, waste reduction, and 
environmentally responsible renovation 
construction. 

In 
2005, 
Yale's 
Greenhouse Gas Reduction Committee 
declared a goal of reducing Yale's 
emissions by 10 percent below 1990 levels 
by 2020 
or roughly 43 percent below a 
business-as-usual, base-case scenario. 

So far, the University has made 
progress toward this goal through greener 
renovations, 
motion-sensor 
lighting 
in college common spaces, and the 
appointment of a director of sustainable 
transportation systems. Students have 
shown 
support 
in 
well-established 
groups like the Student Taskforce for 
Environmental Partnership 
Yale Student Environmental Coalition. 

Sustainably Thinking, a new student 
organization, will provide big-picture 
advice to the other groups on campus. 

As more and more consumers demand 
to know where their food comes from, the 
voice of the Yale Sustainable Food Project 
is no longer a sage in the wilderness .. 

Now, Yale University Dining Service's 
rejection of the corporate machine for 
community-based management will be 
reflected in its kitchens, as cooks forgo 
sacks of dehydrated potato powder for 
fresh Yukon Golds, mashed by hand and 
flavored with extra virgin olive oil, garlic, 
and whole peppercorns. In this sense, 
the new, self-operated Dining Services 
appears to be no more than an attempt 
to follow corporate America's latest 
sustainability trend. But we started it .
