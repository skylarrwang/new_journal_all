the American love 
affair 
with corporate efficiency has turned 
sour. En.ron and Martha Stewart have 
poisoned our infatuation with Sam's 
Club and Big Macs as documentary after

Gap cotton. But luckily for its executives, 
corporate America has found the ticket 
to .redemption. Now, for every celebrity 
"going green," a massive corporation 
has announced its own sustainability · 
1rut1at1ve. 
In 2005, General Electric launched 
its "EcomagUnation" program promoting 
economically advantageous greenhouse 
gas .reduction. In February, Wal-Ma.rt 
unveiled its "Sustainability 360" project, 
which will prioritize sustainable products, 
.renewable energy, and waste .reduction. 
And on September 27m, Duke announced 
its new Corporate Sustainability Initiative, 
a research program co-operated by the 
University's business and environmental 
schools. 
l:ale 
University, 
which employed 
11,7 50 people and earned a 28 percent 
return on its $22.5 billion endowment Un 
the last fiscal year, is keeping up with the 
(Dow) Joneses. In June, l:ale decided to 
terminate its ten year relationship with 
Corporation, the world's 
tbUrd-la.rgest 
food 
service 
provider, 
in order to return to a self-operated 
Dining Services that will focus heavily 
on integrating the v:alues of the l:ale 
Sustainable Food Project into students' 
dining experience. This decision is one of 
many leading l:ale down the increasingly 
fashionable path of sustainability and 
ethical busUness leadership.

........ Services assumed joint control of 
l:ale University Dining Services when the 
University hired 
in 1997, 
and Ernst Huff, associate vice president 
of SFAS, has closely collaboration with 
the corporation ever sUnce. He says that 
Yale, hoping to reverse Dining Services' 
tendency to run a negative budget, was 
originally 
attracted 
"bottom-line"-management style. 
This methodology had its business 
benefits. In Huff's unsmiling, professional

accomplishments during its time at Yale 
were greater oversight of the cooking 
process, which was "not an exact science 
prior to 
" and improved 
inventory management in 
individual 
dining halls. All 1 7 of them. 
Yale's 
residential 
college 
systern, 
which is pitched as a distinctive strength 
to prospective . students, also makes it 
difficult for the University to feed its 
flocks once they enroll. In addition to 
Commons, five graduate school dining 
rooms, and four separate retail facilities, 
l:ale must staff eleven residential college 
dining halls. (One is off-line each year 
as the colleges are renovated). This 
feat requires 350 full-time-equivalent 
employees, not to mention managers and 
administrators. SUnce l:ale employees are 
unionized under Local35, the University 
does not have the option of cutting labor 
costs. 
"There are very few variables that you 
can manipulate within Dining Services," 


Huff explains. "Employee salaries are

Yale 
University," wrote 
's Director 
of Communications Karen Cutler Un a 
statement about the Yale-A 
partnership. "Since 1997, A ... '-.L 
has 
developed, 
implemented 
and 
continuously enhanced l:ale's residential, 
retail and catering programs, resulting in 
increased customer satisfaction, revenue 
growth and operational improvements." 
Though dining administrators and 
workers 
both praised 
RK's 
effect on l:ale's finances, long-term Yale 
managers and employees underwent a 
rocky transition to A 
's bottom-
line policy, which resulted in frequent 
complaints of food shortages. "In some 
cases 
there were challenges," Huff 
admits, referring to accusations of short-
ordering. It took time for A 
RK 
management to become familiar with 
Yale's consumption patterns. Hired to 
reduce Yale's food budget, they often 
took the "less is more" approach when 
ordering food.

brought 
corporate 
efficiency to l: ale's 
inventory 
system. With an empire managing food 
services at over four hundred colleges, 
universities, and preparatory schools, the 
company immediately instituted thorough 
and regular inventories of Yale's dining 
halls. Ordering policies shifted in a way 
that many long-term l:ale employees had 
never seen before, and managers were 
forced to plan ahead. Under the self-
operated Dining Services, if a college 
ran out of lettuce or milk, it 
could often 
be delivered that day from a nearby Yale 
commissary at Long Wharf.

And when the food arrived, not 
everyone was happy with its quality. The 
biannual customer satisfaction surveys 
that 
instituted on arrival 
garnered consistently low ratings during 
the corporation's first four years at Yale. 
"Before 
came, 
we 
had more variety," remembers Andrea 
Rankins, a ten-year Saybrook employee.

to college and tightening control over 
employees. 0' eal Galloway, a grill 
worker who has been a member of 
Calhoun College's team for 16 years,

college dining hall during his six years

Though Huff could not provide up-
to-date numbers of original Yale managers

· At the Saybrook dining hall, Rankins 
and Linda Felder, who have worked for 
Dining Services since 1985, could together 
name only two Yale managers who'd been 
around before A 
. "This dining 
hall hasn't been run well since Marie," 
Rankins confides, referring to the Yale 
manager 
moved to a different 
dining hall during its transition years. 
Felder agrees. "The Yale managers 
were better," she asserts. "Some of these, 
they don't know what they're doing."

fondness for the original Yale managers.

felt 
this 
familiarity disappear. "They just seem like

moving his arms like an automaton, he 
imitates his perception of the 
mentality: "Like, 'We're gonna turn this 
thing around."' The new managers, 
charged to increase efficiency, assigned 
more work in the same number of hours, 
affecting employees in every dining hall.

though many have not yet decided which 
path to pursue, both Galloway and Barnes 
have noticed a positive change in dining 
hall management this year. They say that 
original Yale managers, as well as some 
ones, have already begun to 
scale back employee duties. 
Huff admits that managerial turnover 
was a problem during 
transition to Yale. Two years after the 
company arrived, Huff explains, many 
Yale managers who'd been needing "a 
nudge" left Yale and were replaced by 
employees. This turnover 
was echoed at the highest administrative 
level as Dining Services cycled through 
three executive directors in ten years. 
Yale administrators, however, were not

efficiency and save money, employees 
must work harder. Products must be 
regulated more closely. These are golden 
rules in the bottom-line business, as Sam 
Walton and Richard Levin well know. Yale

rather 
than 
guaranteeing Yale the best products at the 
lowest prices. Huff says he has not heard 
of any such arrangements. 
Trumbull Manager Edd Ley, who 
began working at Yale in 1970, oversaw 
Dining Services' purchases at the Long 
Wharf Commissary before 
eliminated the storehouse and reassigned 
him to Trumbull. Ley, who loves dining 
and loves Yale, was happy to be back in 
the trenches. "Doing business under the 
realm of the contractor was different," he 
says, "but it was still about serving." When 
pressed to speak about the difference 
between a self-operated Dining er vices 
and an 
-operated Dining 
Services, Ley raises his e ebrows and 
asks, "Do you want somebod else to 
raise your children?" 
o matter how well 
Yale worked together 
and according to 
Ley, it was pretty well

till a third party. With the new turnover 
in management, Ley hope "it'll be Yale 
taking care of Yale." He remembers 
previous 
self-operated Dining 
Services with pride. ''When we operated 
as an independent, we always wanted the 
best product at the best price, and that 
was always reflected in the invoice." 
the past four years, Yale has 
reconsidered its definition 
of the "best product." Before 2001, 
when the University founded the Yale 
Sustainable Food Project with the help 
of world-renowned chef Alice Waters, 
the best apple might have been from a 
large, Oregonian mass production farm 
in California. Now, the best apple is local 
and sustainable, grown on a family-run 
orchard 26 miles from Yale. 
By the time Y FP inaugurated its 
local, seasonable, and sustainable menu 
at the Berkeley "test kitchen" in 2003, 
Dining 
ervices had already begun to 
prioritize higher quality food, Huff says.
