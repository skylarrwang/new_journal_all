'ow would you like your steak 
cooked?" asks an employee at 
Gasttonomique, 
though 
it's a question you'd expect to hear 
pronounced in a French accent at a fancy 
bistro! du coin, the woman taking the order is 
communicating with her customer over the 
telephone. "Come by in about 15 minutes," 
she adds before returning the receiver 
to its cradle. When the customer arrives 
to pick up his steak frites, the epicurean 
entree awaits him on the small countertop 
that comprises most of Gasttonomique's 
surface area. It's packaged in a styrofoam 
box, and, like every order here, it's to go. 

In front of a sizzling stove in a hole-in-
the-wall shop on the corner of High and 
Crown, a man dressed in a white undershirt 
flips a succulent patty. His solid build and 
dark coloring make him look more mob 
boss than head chef, yet this could-be 
cousin of Tony Soprano is sweating at 
the fires of a double burner, not a double 
arson. 

Mark 
Woll, 
Gasttonomique's 
founder and chef, is in the middle of a job. 
And right now, his concerns are culinary, 
not convivial. 

''A lot of customers expect me to smile 
and be nice to them," Woll says, mopping 
his brow. ''But a surgeon wouldn't talk 
while operating." Despite the unseasonably 
warm weather, it's about ten degrees 
hotter inside Gastronomique than outside. 
Though the restaurant has only two chairs, 
it's two too many for the space. The seats, 
like the tastefutblack and white photos of 
the Eiffel tower that hang on the walls, are 
really just for ambiance. Gastronomique is 
take-out, gourmet take-out. Walk-ins are 
welcome, and slightly more experienced 
customers know to call ahead. But the 
Gastro add!cts 
the regulars, many of 
whom are off-campus Yalies, none of 
whom can exhaust the shop's exhaustive 
menu 
are on the meal plan.
