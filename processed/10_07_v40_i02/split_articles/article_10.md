WHAT's IN A
MIE? AccoRDING TO L EE
and Tracy Jackson, a lot. Just before
classes began, the duo, owners of Koffee
Too?, announced a contest to rename
their store. The prize: free coffee for a
year. The person who.se name is selected
could save $1529.35, or the price of one
cup of coffee 365 times over.

The smali York Street coffee shop's
current name stems from former ties with
Koffee on Audubon. When the Jacksons
relinquished ownership of I<offee in
2002, however, Koffee Too? remained
connected in name. As General Manager
Benjamin Wilkinson explains with a
smile, ''We're really about seven years
overdue for a name change." Much of
the impetus for the current rechristening
comes from a growing desire to distance
their store from their competitors at
Koffee on Audubon and its sister shop,
Koffee on Orange, which was known
as Moka until this September. ''We want
people to know the difference between
the two," says Wilkinson. Scott Crawl,
a K2 barista, agrees; he claims the new
name will "differentiate our brand from
the other Koffees." Crawl also notes that
the current name connotes a sense of
inferiority. ''We're Koffee Too. The 'too'
is altnost diminutive
like we're the little
brother or sister," he says.

The new name should also reflect the
store's changing identity. Koffee Too?'s
ambiance is a bit like a European· cafe's;
it attracts the man in a beret sipping his
coffee while reading three newspapers,
the rnusic major furiously scribbling
notes on a taff, and students like Kyle
Wilmoth, who returns to K2 because the
"coffee's good and it's close to where I
work." However, as the contest fliers
suggest, I<offee Too? now wants to be
known as a shop that serves "Koffee With
a Konscience." As the shop has long
been an environmental pioneer (they're
one of few stores that use biodegradable
cold
cups),
envit;onmentally-centered
submissions like "Just · Grounds" or
"Green Bean" are particularly apropos.
"We have a new roaster, Dillanos in
Seattle," says Wilkinson, "All of our coffee
is traded fairly and certified organic." A
. name that reflects this commitment to
the environment and · issues of justice
might also link K2, at least in spirit, to the
sustainability initiatives within Yale and
the greater New Haven area.

A few clever submissions, however,
may lead I<offee Too? to change course.
Instead
of
boasting
environmental
prowess, the new name would link
the shop closer to Yale. For instance,
Skull and Beans, one graduate student's
submission, establishes a connection
between the store and the masses of
over:-caffeinated, occasionally studious
Yalies that fill it (even if they're just there
·for the free Wi-Fi and comfy chairs).
Tying the name into Yale could have a
tremendous impact on the business side as
well. "Many people come to New Haven
to see Yale," Crawl explains. "It might
be possible to tap into that." Crawl also
cites · the "merchandizing potential" of a
Yale-infused name. ''We could play into
the iconography," he says. But there are
some dissenters. "I really don't like when
people or the local businesses conform
to Yale," comments Tess Dearing, a
Berkeley junior and K2 regular, and
also an editor of this magazine. "I find
the Yaleness overwhelming, unnatural,
stilted." Another daily K2 consumer puts
it more bluntly: "That will just be selling
out." No matter the winning submission,
Yale will be intrinsically connected to the
new name. After all, the University has
to approve it. While the staff of Koffee
Too? voted for their favorites last week,
Yale owns the building and has veto
rights over the name.

Luckily, there were many submissions
to choose from. And the impulse to
submit often stemmed from more than
just the free coffee. Davenport senior and
• •
prolific submitter Mary Daniel explains,
"It would be cool to walk by everyday
and see the name I submitted. Especially
as a senior, it would be nice to have part
of me remain in New Haven." And, in
a competitive atmosphere like Yale, there
was a desire to improve upon those
submissions already in the box. Daniel
first decided to submit because she
peeked at the other entries and thought
"I could do better." While a few diehards
decided looking at submissions would
stifle their creativity, Daniel and many
others leafed through the box, searching
for names to improve upon and laughing
at a few submissions that were "not so
good."

Good,
bad
for
current
customers, the actual name is unimportant.
While there is the occasional zealot, most
patrons are, like Kyle Wilmoth, "not
really concerned." As long the coffee
stays good, it doesn't matter whether it
comes from Koffee Too?, Tracy's Place,
or Ground Central.

It may be that the act of change itself
reflects K2's identity more than any new
name will. Crawl explains that Koffee
Too? "has a tradition of revitalization;
updating image; staying fresh." At one
point, for instance, the walls of the shop
were mauve or tan, "but we came back
from winter break one year and they were
suddenly blue. And now they're orange
with murals."

But innovation breeds resistance.
Littered among the novel suggestions in
the box by the cash register were pleas
that the name be unchanged. Many
proposals, like "e=_k2," "Kup of Koffee,"
and "Kafenation," paid homage to the
current name. Some were more direct.
As one submission put it, "New name:
'Koffee Too?' Reason: 'I like this name."'
