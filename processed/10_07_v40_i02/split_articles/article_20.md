project titled "el pensamiento anti-imperialista 
del pueblo Cubano" (the anti-imperialist 
thought of the Cuban people). "They 
never would've accepted my project if I'd 
said 'how ·el Partido manipulated the image 
of the United States,"' he says. 
Although 
Yale's 
authorization 
eases the Treasury Department limits 
on a student's travel, restrictions are 
inevitable. Students are only allowed to 
spend a certain amount of money in 
Cuba per day, and are required to keep 
all their receipts for potential inspection. 
Though the scarcity of paper, thrivirig 
' 
black market, and evasion of official 
price 
controls 
eliminate 
almost all 
possibility of documenting transactions, 
Bustamante says students must try their 
. best to stay in line. "To this day, I have a 
file of the receipts that I did collect." For 
American students, traveling to Cuba is 
a careful balance of satisfying the home 
government, the host government, and 
one's daily needs. 

McElroy had grown dissatisfied with 
the capitalist system in the U.S., and . 
traveled to Cuba with stirrings of sympathy 
for the revolution's ideals of equality in 
health care, education, earnings, and race 
relations. His initial interactions with 
other Cubans reinforced this view, but 
after the honeymoon period, his politics 
changed quickly. "None of my [Cuban] 
friends were telling me the truth at that 
point," he explains, "but what I came to 
realize was how much complexity there 
was in the situation." 

One night toward the beginning of his 
ten weeks, McElroy was walking through 
a tourist hangout with a friend. McElroy 
is very fair; his friend dark-skinned. While 
they waited for two others to arrive, 
a policeman circled suspiciously. He 
eventually approached the two, greeted 
McElroy with 
a 
courteous "Buenas 
noches," and asked him a few questions 
to determine that he wasn't Cuban. 
Then, he asked McElroy's friend for his 
identification card. He walked a few feet 
away with it, and then read the friend's 
full name into his walkie-talkie to a 
central authority, presumably to confirm 
. 
that he was a "jinetero," a tourist tricker. 
McElroy was angry. He approached the 
policeman, told him that he wasn't some 
turista estupido at the mercy of any wily 
con-man on the street, that this man was 
his good friend and must be left alone. 
"I was fighting with him, and really they 
can't do anything ·to tourists." He was 
surprised and outraged at the officer's 
racism, but he came to understand that, 
in Cuba, discrimination is the norm. 
"This would define my experience," he 
explained; 

Combining daily experiences with his 
research on the Cuban press, McElroy 
soon began to understand the irony of the 
government's depictions of the United 
States as a bastion of racism. Other ironies 
stood out as well. In the much-touted 
Cuban health-care system, foreigners are 
given preferential treatment and doctors 
are shipped off to other countries to 
maintain the image of the revolution. 
Though the revolution aimed to harness 
tourism for the Cuban people, McElroy 
says that many foreigners now consider 
Cuba "the brothel of the world." Though 
many Cubans listen to the anti-U.S. 
sensationalist media, just as many distrust 
the government enough to assume the 
opposite of anything propagated by the 
national media. Revolutionary leaders 
touted Soviet-style communism, but the 
people never entirely bought it. 
"Soviet culture was really mocked as 
having no relevance to Cuba," McElroy 
explains. 
The Cuban media scorns 
capitalism, he says, and then "you go 
around Cuba and I've never seen so 
much fucking Puma in my life!" At one 
point, McElroy spotted a man getting the 
Puma logo shaved into his head. 

Michael Fernandez insists that the 
opportunity to speak to Cuban exiles in the 
•• 
U.S. renders travel to Cuba unnecessary. 
"There are a lot of Cuban exiles, Cuban 
dissidents, who were in jail for 25 years," 
he says. "Go talk with anyone and they'll 
tell you it's not a paradise." 

The debate over travel to Cuba pits 
academic 
freedom 
against 
concern 
for the freedom of the Cuban people. 
McElroy believes that speaking only to 
exiles would have limited his scope, and 
that his research project necessitated 
speaking with Cubans living in Cuba to 
determine the effects of a sensationalist 
national media. 

Fernandez argues that nothing short 
of a family member in a critical situation, 
like a dying grandfather, merits regime-
supporting travel to the island. 

1chael Bustamante was raised in a 
ban exile family. His paternal 
grandparents left the island with three 
children in 1962 and never went back. 
Iri. Cuba, his research focused on 
1920s bourgeois intellectuals who took 
divergent paths in the years leading up 
to Castro's dictatorship. Some became 
die-hard supporters, others outspoken 
enemies of the regime. Their chief 
outlet was the publication of essays and 
visual art in highbrow magazines and 
journals. Bustamante was also able to 
read much of their correspondence at 
the National Archives in Havana. While 
his research wouldn't have been nearly as 
comprehensive without a visit to Cuba, 
the transformative part of his travel lies 
in his rediscovery of family ties. 

"No one in my family had been 
back in forty-plus years," he explains. 
His grandfather told him about some 
remaining family on the island and 
suggested 
that Bustamante consider 
visiting them if he had the time. 

Beginning on July 26th, when almost 
all Cuban institutions shut down for 
celebrations, he set out to visit his cousins 
in Santiago. ;r'echnically, Bustamante's 
academic visa did not permit such travel, 
but his research became impossible when 
the archives closed. Bustamante didn't 
realize how important the visit was until 
' . 
he was in Santiago. "My grandfather, he 
absolutely felt that it was necessary to do 
that, but he 'didn't necessarily want to put 
the burden on me." 

In Santiago, he spoke to the woman
