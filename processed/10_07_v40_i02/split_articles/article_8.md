THURSDAY 
EVENINGS 
AND 
FRIDAY 
afternoons, a second sign hangs at 810 
State Street underneath the faded, peeling 
wooden plaque that reads "N everending 
Books." This one is bigger and newer and 
brighter. In hot pink capital letters, it de-
clares "Elm City Infoshop." Though the 
lettering is bold, the words themselves 
are unilluminating. The group's unofficial 
nickname, "the anarchist bookstore," helps 
a little, but it can create misconceptions of 
its own 
one Yalie was sure the group was 
somehow a "front" for the Party of the 
Right. 

The first person I see when I arrive at 
the Elm City Infoshop is Jim Hoffecker, a 
quiet man with a beard and long ponytail. 
He is setting up the sign to announce the 
Infoshop's takeover of the space for the 
evening. When I ask him about the Infos-
hop, he tells me, ''I'm the leader." Then he 
laughs. "Just kidding." 

Of course, the Infoshop's ideology 
won't allow for any kind of leadership. 
While the "anarchistic bookstore" is indeed 
anarchistic in practice, it isn't a bookstore 
at all. According to the group's website, it's 
a "non-profit, collectively run space for 
the exchange of ideas as they pertain to 
the interests of our community." In other 
words, it's an organization that provides 
a place for people to talk, hosts a weekly 
book club, and operates a modest lending 
library. 

The lending library, which consists 
of one bookcase, stands · in Neverend-
ing Books' dark, dusty front room. The 
space is crammed with· shelves and shelves 
of used books, s9me alphabetized, some 
just stacked on top of each other. The 
Infoshop's sirigle bookcase is filled with 
unalphabetized radical .and anarchist litera-
' 
ture of all kinds, ranging from Anarcho.ryn-
dicalism: Theory and Practice to Nietzsche to 
more conventional fare like The Philosopf?y 
of Punk and Naomi Wol£ A sign informs 
visitors that these books, unlike many of 
the others in Neverending Books, are not 
free and are meant to be borrowed. 

In the next room, about ten people 
have settled into .chairs, perched on stools, 
or claimed spots on the floor, chatting with 
each other as they wait for the Infoshop's 
weekly book club meeting to begin. Al-
though the Infoshop is not affiliated with 
Yale, most of those in attendance are stu-
dents of one kind or another. They sport 
the badges of non-conformity: mostly un-
shaven, often pierced. Unusual hairstyles 
and square-framed glasses abound. 

I pass up the red swivel chairs and sit 
down; Someone says I look like I'm about 
to read them a story. Instead, I ask a basic 
question that's been intt iguing me: What 
is anarchism? A long pause follows. ''It's 
complicated," someone finally ventures. 

Perhaps the hesitation is not surpris-
ing, given that uninformative "an-" at the 
beginning of the word. Anarchists agree 
on what they reject 
government, or, in 
the case of the Elm City Infoshop, any 
kind of hierarchy at all 
but their views 
vary widely on everything else. ''There's a 
lot of room for discussion and disagree-
ment," member Mike Ketch explains. 

Today, though, there isn't much con-
tention on display. The group would 
rather talk about their anarchist actions 
than quibble over definitions. Ketch tells 
me about the Infoshop members' involve-
ment with the group Food Not Bombs, 
an organization that provides food to the . 
homeless. ''Instead of writing to our con-
gressman and saying, 'There are hungry 
people in New Haven,' it's a leaderless way 
to tackle the problem." 

Other members mention one anarchist 
group that fights sexual assault without 
involving to the police, and another that 
provides free mental health care. "All you 
need to be an anarchist," Ketch tells me, 
"is to say, 'I don't want a boss, or a tyrant, 
or a president. I just want to work things 
out with my neighbor without calling the 
police."' 

All this sounds innocent enough. Yet, 
according to Ketch, "Yale is certainly hos-
tile to anarchists." Other members pro-
vide several examples of the University's 
antagonism, including the decision not 
to renew former Yale professor David 
Graeber's contract with the Anthropology 
Departtnent in 2005, allegedly because of 
his anarchist beliefs. 

Indeed, several . members, including 
Ketch, . are wary of being tied in print to 
an anarchist group. Even Ketch uses an 
assumed name with the group. He recalls 
a time when he and a friend, who was fac-
ing critnit;lal charges, were forbidden to as-
sociate because of Ketch's ties to radical 
groups. On a more pedestrian level, mem-
bers fear prospective employers being put 
off after a Google search. 

Asked to imagine an anarchist soci-
ety, the group again draws a blank 
and, 
they counter, that's not the point. ''I have 
no idea," says Camille Seaberry, "and if 
I sit around all day thinking about what 
it might look like, I'll never get anything 
done." Anyway, she says, anarchy already 
exists, exemplified by groups like the Elm 
City Infoshop. '~ decisions are made as a 
collective," she says, "and that's anarchy." 

A few minutes later, the book club 
begins to discuss the fifteenth issue of 
the 'zine Doris, subtitled "D. I. Y Antide-
pression Guide." Having picked out the 
week's reading, Kanga Dee is responsible 
for leading the discussion. 'Ibis makes 
her nervous. ''I dGn't think I've ever re-
ally facilitated anything before," she says, 
and after tentatively calling on the first few 
people to speak, she gives up, letting the 
conversation unfold spontaneously. The 
talk doesn't really need a leader, anyway.
