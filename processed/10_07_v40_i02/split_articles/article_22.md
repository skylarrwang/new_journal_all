THE NEW JOURNAL 


n Friday afternoon, while some 
of her classmates sleep through 
their labs, Kate Hawkins teaches 
multiplication, pounding her arm against 
the table to the rhythm of her speech~ . . 
"Four times thre.e?" Pound,. pound, 
pound . . Her pupil, Jason Cartman, flicks 
his eyes towards . the ceiling, deep in 
thought. "Twelve?" he replies. His answer 
receives a punctuated ''Yes!" and another 
pound, this time in jubilation. . 
Earlier in the session, Hawkins 
explains, Carunan was having trouble 
with the concept of multiplication, 
calculating equations by hand with little 
check marks that took ages to count up. 
Now he's running through the tables with 
minimal trouble. "He's really getting it," 
she says proudly.

This scene could be from any 
elementary school tutoring program, 
except that Cartn1an is well over six feet 
tall and in prison. 


Every Friday, Hawkins and a handful 
of other Yale students spend two hours in 
Cheshire, Connecticut preparing inmates 
of the Cheshire prison for the GED. 
They settle in the prison's classrooms, 
ready to answer questions about the 
math, language arts, and social studies 
sections of the exam. Every Friday, the 
same inmates filter in, clutching their 
math books, ready to ask questions about 
fractions and conjunctions. All of them 
are serving time. All of them are trying to 
graduate high schooL 
. 
The Cheshire 
pri~on's program is 
by no means unique. Its Prison School 
lies under the jurisdiction of Unified 
School District 1, a depar-unent that 
provides educational programming in 
18 Connecticut prisons for over twelve 
thousand inmates. Last year, 682 inmates 
earned their GED in U.S. District · 1. 
Thirty-seven were students at Cheshire. 
Cheshire's 
GED 
program 
isn't 
the prison's only educational offering. 
Students who are not ready for the exam 
can take basic reading and math classes. 
Those who have alre~dy received a high 
school diploma can enroll in one college 
class each semester. Occasionally~ Yale 
volunteers offer fun, informal classes like 
creative writing and art history. The prison 
also provides its inmates with vocational 
seminars, by far the most popular courses, 
which teach skills such as woodworking 
October 2007 
and computer or automotive repair. 


Even against the array of alternative 
classes, the GED program stands out. 
"If it's not the only program, it sometimes 
seems like the most important," . says 
Pria Anand, a Berkeley sophomore who 
runs the tutoring program this year. "It's 
someone's high school graduation 
that's 
such a big goal." 


Dorthula Green, Cheshire Prison 
School's principal, cites her favorite 
quote from the '70s TV show Baretta: 
· "Do the time, don't let the time do you." 
For inmates, she explains, the GED often 
represents a chance to finish something 
• • 
and make positive use of their jail time. 
This is why Green has gone to such 
lengths to incorporate Yale students into 
her program, despite serious hurdles. 
"My philosophy is that we need to make 
sure to do eve 
· g we can to make the 
time as productive and empowering as 
possible," she says. 


This 
philosophy 
allowed Jessica 
Jiang, the former head of the program 
and a current tutor, to start the Cheshire 
program in the fall of her junior year, 
inspired by similar work she had done in 
the New Haven Correctional Facility. It's 
this same commitment that has allowed 
the Cheshire effort to thrive while the 
New Haven program, though housed in a 
non-federal facility, is temporarily halted 
due to administrative problems. 
---4 ducation is the most poweiful weapon you 
__. can use to change the world." 


This Nelson Mandela quote, carved 
into a wooden plaque on a long wall 
above a security desk, greets visitors 
entering the Cheshire Prison School The 
rooms are large and bright and filled with 
dozens of new computers. The walls 
brandish posters of the "Great Books" 
and To Kill a Mockingbird, commemorating 
Cheshire's participation in 'The Big Read' 
during New Haven's Festival of Arts 
and Ideas last year. Aside from a lack 
of school supplies (the prison restricts 
the use of markers, pencils, and other 
writing.utensils for safety reasons), there 
is almost nothing that differentiates these 
facilities from those of a well-equipped 
grade school. 


Yet, the elaborate bureaucracy and 
regulatory system controlling the flow of 
people into and out of the prison remains 
daunting. Visitor rules are posted around 
the waiting room in English and Spanish: 
If you are late to visiting hours, you forfeit 
your right to visit; if you are unregistered 
nson 
in advance, you forfeit your right to visit; 
if. you wear an article of clothing that 
might set off the metal detectors (such as 
an underwire bra) and try to remove it in 
public, you forfeit your right to visit. 


Many of the same strictures apply 
to tutors. They must fill out pages of 
paperwork to gain clearance. A prison 
staff member must escort them at all 
times. Nothing can be brought into the 
prison: no cell phones, no purses. Only a 
photo I.D. may be taken into the waiting 
room, and even that must be left at the 
front desk upon arrival. Often, there are 
glitches. Last week, a tutor's shoes set 
off the metal detector. Another time, 
one of the prison-issued panic beepers 
went off repeatedly during the two hours 
of tutoring. Anand remembers a recent 
·setback when a new guard wouldn't let 
the tutors into the facility. "He just kept 
saying, 'I don't know your faces, I'm not 
sure."' The tutors were left in the waiting 
room for over an hour. 


Oftentimes, tutors must overcome 
difficulties 
far 
beyond 
logistics. 
The Cheshire prison population is 
predominately African-American 
and 
Hispanic; Yale tutors are usuaiJy white 
or Asian-American. Cheshire is an all-
male facility, while all the current Yale 
35 


~tors are female. Aside from a few mild 
instances 
a flirtatious note sent from 
a prisoner to a tutor, an odd comment 
now and then 
both tutors and inmates 
are conscientious. "Everyone walks on 
eggshells," Anand explains. "The inmates, 
the warden, the students. It's sort of a 
novel thing for everyone." 


For 
tutor 
Samantha 
Amodeo, 
the Prison School students are more 
uncomfortable 
with · the 
gender 
discrepancy than the tutors. "Some . of 
the inmates have said, 'Why is it all girls · 
corDing, don't any guys want to do this?"' 
Sometimes, Amodeo thinks, the inmates 
might be more at ease learning from male 
( 
a 
that is really unique and glamorous, and 
when you get there it can be a little more 
like a slap in the face." 


· But for Amodeo, who's been tutoring 
at Cheshire for almost a year, adjusting 
to the new setting was much easier than 
she expected. "I went in the first week 
thinking, 'This is a federal prison, I've 
gotta be sort of tough,' but now I think 
it's a more relaxed· learning environment 
than at Yale. It's often the best part of my 
week," she says. 


Green believes the program is mostly 
self-selecting. Tutors who don't take the 
program seriously, ·or who come for the 
wrong reasons, usually end up dropping 
can 
J 
ecauseo excesszve enevo ence 
or so 
e sense o 
tutors. 


Even the academic material can feel 
out of place at times. It's uncomfortable, 
. . 
for example, when a teaching aide uses an 
example about car mileage with a student 
who no longer possesses a driver's 
license. 


A few weeks ago, Anand was prepping 
a section of the exam . that required 
students to state whether a · phrase 
consisted of fact or opinion. One of the 
· statements read, ''All U.S. citizens have 
the right to vote." "Obviously they meant 
it to be 'fact,"' she says, "but for someone 
who's incarcerated, it's not fact." 


Most Yale students would not trade 
tutoring . kindergarteners at elementary 
schools ten minutes from campus for 
a fifty-minute drive to Cheshire and 
two hours with convicted criminals. 
The tutoring program attracts more 
seniors than freshmen, and participants 
generally learn about the program via 
word of mouth rather than on-campus 
advertising. There is a fairly high initial 
drop-out rate among the tutors, explains 
Beth Reisfeld, who runs the New Haven 
Correctional Center's program. ''Prison 
tutoring seems like the kind of activity

JJ 
out in the first semester. "I always tell 
the tutors you can't come because of 
excessive benevolence or some sense of 
rich white guilt," Green says. "People 
pick up on that and you become less than 
th 
. " 
au entre. 


· If the point of a GED is to aid in 
finding employment, then why would 
the Cheshire inmates 
who are serving 
anywhere from five to 99 years 
need 
the diploma? Green has asked this 
question herself. But the first time she 
awarded . a GED, she realized the degree 
meant much more than gaining access 
to a job. "When these guys earn their 
diploma, that's the first step towards 
thinking they can accomplish stuff. At 
Yale, you don't necessarily choose a major 
because it leads to a particular job. It's the 
same here; there's an intrinsic value to 
education." Although Connecticut law 
requires inmates under the age of 21 to 
participate in educational programming, 
most of the Cheshire students are older. 
They choose to participate anyway. 


They consider the Prison School such a 
privilege, .in fact, that prison authorities 
often punish inmates by forbidding them 
to attend. 


Anand remembers a group of GED 
candidates who continued to participate 
in tutoring sessions while waiting for 
their GED results. "They still came to 
tutoring anyway, even though they'd 
already taken the test," she recalls .. "One 
guy started asking me questions about 
trig, just because, 'why not,' he was 
interested." When the inmates received 
their GED scores, all of them passing, 
the first people they told were. their tutors. 
"They just came in with these huge smiles 
waving their certificates around," explains 
Anand. 


Jiang, her predecessor, chimes in. 
"That was just the best day." 


Experiences 
like 
this 
make 
the 
tutoring program especially rewarding 
for its Yale participants. Amodeo says 
that h~r students often ask whether she's 
being paid. "When they find out that 
we're here just because we want to be, 
they just really care." 


For Jiang, the students' dedication 
makes the travel time and security 
meas·ures worthwhile. "Just seeing these 
people who want to learn so much," 
she says, "I realize I have this great 
opportunity at Yale." 


essica, Jessica," a voice calls out. Jiang 
swivels in her seat. Jermaine Davidson, 
inmate who has been in tutoring 
classes for a little over six months, pops 
his head through the classroom door. 
"I couldn't come today, 'cause I got 
in trouble. But I'll be here next Friday. I 
need real help." 


Randall Jennings, another student, 
swings his palm in a semi-circle against 
his forehead. "I'm nothing but cobwebs 
up here, nothing but cobwebs," he says, 
stretching a smile across his face. With 
the help of Jiang, Anand, and their fellow 
tutors, those webs have begun to trap 
ideas .
