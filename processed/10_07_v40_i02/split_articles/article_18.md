Best Video, always in tune with its 
customers' needs, · has been running a 
similar mail-order service for years. In 
1994, four years before the birth of N etflix, 
Best Video shipped hundreds of titles a 
month to countries across the .world. Its 
service, however, can hardly compete with
<;me of the ten largest users of first-class 
we struggle to shed. 
In an age when 
r.eplication signals business success, Hank 
firmly insists there can only be one Best 
Video, and it can only be here. 
· "People 
from 
Hollywood, 
L.A., 
Washington, D.C., New York are always 
asking us to move or open another place," 
Hank admits as he stands behind the 
counter, leaning over a large paperback I 
assume is a movie encyclopedia, and later

Despite 
the 
company's 
brilliant 
capitalization on this at-your-doorstep 
concept, Netflix marks another step in 
our society's steady march toward perfect 
customization in perfect isolation. Cinema 
has become yet another area of modern 
life that we have divested of place, as if 
physical location were an archaic notion

u 
notice is the Old Testament. ''But we could 
never replicate what we have here. For one 
thing, I'm here." Even if the selection 
could be duplicated (which it couldn't), 
there's no carbon 
or electronic 
copy 
of Hank. 
And in a sentiment echoed by other 
Best Video staff members, Hank believes 
the particular character of the local 
• • 
community has allowed his store to thrive 
in a way it might not elsewhere. From 
the die-hard skateboarder looking for 
the latest cult hit to the academic couple 
on a Czech film kick, from the graduate 
student researching silent films to the 
huddle of gel-haired boys who just want 
to see Traniformers, Best Video and local 
residents hit it off a long time ago and have 
maintained a real friendship ever since. 
Of course, as a native of New Haven 
and 
longtime 
Best 
Video 
member, 
am 
inevitably 
recognized. Joseph 
LaPalombara, a retired Yale professor in 
political science, interrupts my browsing 
to ask my last name. Moments earlier he 
had instructed a staff member to "F8" 
-
him, referring to the button that brings up 
a customer's rental history, because he's 
"a little punchy" at this time of day and 
can't remember whether he's already seen 
The Lives of Others. He found Best Video 
the "day or week" it opened and has been 
renting about four films a week ever since. 
«You're Jonathan Lear's daughter?" he 
asks, looking at me again. ''I met you when 
you were this tall," he says, lowering his 
hand to about three feet off the ground.

A few minutes later, Stewart, another 
longr itne Best Video patron, wrests from 
me that I am a senior English major 
with an uncertain future, and· then tells 
me he knows the exact film I have to 
see. Stewart, for his part, rents whatever 
movies his wife tells him to 
"she's 
from Harvard" 
although, in general, 
the couple favors a foreign sensibility. 
Standing under the Best Video awning, 
Stewart assumes the staff's proudest duty: 
recommending the perfect film you've 
never heard o£ 
'When people walk in here," Hank 
explains, "we don't say 'Oh, have you seen 
Knocked Up? It's great!' It did get good 
reviews. But we implicitly try to gauge 
your mood, your interests, and show you 
something you'd never find otherwise." 
Stewart looks at me, and smiles wryly. 
"It's called I Know Where I'm Going," he 
says. "See how especially for you ... ?" I 
do. It's a film, he tells me, about a young 
English woman in Post-War Europe 
October 2007 
who takes off for the Scottish Hebrides, 
because all the men have been killed, and, 
accompanied by a great Scottish tune, 
discovers a new life. "The word for it 
is sweet/' Stewart concludes. "It's a girl 
movie." I rent it, and Hank gives it to me 
free of charge. 
t Blockbuster, half an hour later, I 
~ 
ask Ortiz if he ever recommends 
movies. "Oh, yeah," he grins, '~ the 
time. I just ask people what they're in the 
mood for." A thought occurs to me. "I 
was wondering if you could recommend 
something for me. I'm looking for 
something sweet. A girl movie." I try not 
to elaborate. Ortiz's face drops for a split 
second, then lights up again. "How about 
The Holidtry?" Regrettably, I've seen it. 
"Oh, wait! Have you seen Knocked Up?, I 
tell him that sounds perfect. 
As I walk out, Ortiz is trying to assuage 
a customer on the phone. "I know, people 
come into the store yelling, 'Where's my 
on-line coupons!' 
and we've got no 
answer!" he sympathizes, twirling his 
fingers in the black telephone cord. "I'm 
sorry man, I'm as confused as you are." 
N etflix is clearly causing Blockbuster a 
headache all it's own. 
When I get home, I open N etflix 
and slowly type in "I Know Where I'm 
Going." Stewart told me at the height of 
his excitement that "no one else in the 
world has it," but slight hyperbole was 
certainly part of his charm. I hit return, 
and, of course, it's there. 
''Joan Webster (Wendy Hiller) is a 
headstrong young woman who travels to 
the bleak and moody Scottish Hebrides 
to marry a rich lord ... " I stare at the 
page for a moment, disappointed to have 
found it. But, really, who cares. Would an 
algorithm charting my preferences ever 
have led me to the film that's going to 
change my life?
