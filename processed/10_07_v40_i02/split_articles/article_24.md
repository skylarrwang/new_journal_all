A new take on the old boys' club . 
Yale professor stands at the 
front of a lecture hall, chatting 
with a group of students who 
have hung around after class. ''You know, 
it's hard enough to keep yourself intact 
psychologically as it is, even in the 20th 
century," he tells them with a note of 
urgency in his voice. ''Imagitie how it 
was back there, when everything around 
you was your enemy, when you were 
surrounded by disease and ignorance. It 
was a hell of a situation to be a man in 
those days. It's still pretty rough to be a 
man." 

Thus begins To Be a Man, a film 
made by Yale student Murray Lerner in 
1966 with the purpose of exploring and 
promoting the University experience as it 
was then: intense, insular, and decisively 
male. The smug assertiveness of the title, 
coupled with the self-righteousness of its 
opening moments, marks the film as an 
easy target for a 21st century audience. All 
those earnest white boys in jackets and 
ties, smoking their pipes at the seminar 
table, slicking their hair over to one side 
as if coeducation were not a short three 
years away, as if Bobby Seale and the 
Black Panthers would never descend on 
New Haven and take a battle ax to the 
ivory tower as the city had always known 
it. 

nothing could better typify the stodgy 
and repressive Ivy League attitude that 
we, the Yalies of today, look back on with 
cheerful derision. For women, to show 
anything but contempt for pre-1969 Yale 
would be to negate our very sense of self-
worth as integral parts of this institution. 
To Be a Man might be valuable in certain 
ways, 
namely, to elicit some laughs and 
confirm our assumptions about what 
went on inside that old boys' club of 
yesteryear. But as a serious meditation on 
academics and identity, it seems to have 
little enduring value. 

And yet, once the film fails to make 
good on its latentpromise of misogyny and 
gentlemen's agreement-style racism, once 
it becomes clear that its idea of manhood 
has little to do with the exclusion of other 
groups, To Be a Man is no longer so easy 
to dismiss. "This is ahout that journey of 
the mind we call education," a voiceover 
states at the beginning of the movie. 
"The doubts, debates, and discoveries 
of college students today." While some 
of the fashions and characters featured 
in the film seem quaint, this quest to 
understand what college and learning 
is all about certainly does not. One has 
to wonder: what, exactly, did it mean to 
be a man at Yale in 1966? And, more 
surprisingly, might we, at heart, be good, 
old-fashioned Yale men ourselves? 

Yale of the mid-1960s was on the 
cusp of a great change in American 
education and youth culture. What is less 
clear now is that the University had already 
begun a quieter, internal revolution well 
before the era of campus protests. In 
the 1950s, Yale was a decisively elitist 
institution, even more so than Harvard 
and Princeton. As Jerome Karabel notes 
in his book, The Chosen: The Hidden History 
of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, 
and Princeton, "the foundation of Yale's 
distinctive culture was its close relationship 
with the private boarding schools." The 
Yale admissions board was convinced 
that boarding schools were molding the 
kind of boys they wanted: boys who were 
not simply academically gifted, but who 
also demonstrated the elusive quality of 
"personal promise." "In assessing the 
latter," Karabel writes, "the admissions 
office would look for evidence of a boy's 
'industry,' 'persistence,' 'self-discipline,' 
'sense of responsibility' and ... 'ability to 
participate in group activities.' " 

While Princeton and Harvard were 
making the transition to a standard of 
admission based more on academic merit 
than on abstract personal qualities, Yale 
stood by its character-based policy. A 
Yale education was never intended only to 
produce scholars, or to turn its students 
into brilliant stars of their fields. It was 
meant to create well-rounded, capable, 
and outgoing men. Academically gifted 
students were routinely rejected in favor 
of those who seemed to better represent 
the University's rigorous standards of 
"manliness." In one case that appears in 
Karabel's book, Chairman of the Board 
of Admissions Arthur Howe, Jr. favored 
one academically questionable candidate 
over others because "we just thought he 
was more of a guy." 

By the time the students of To Be a 
Man were admitted in the early '60s, 
times had begun to change. This was 
mostly due to faculty pressure on the 
admissions committee, and the drafting 
of the Doob Report in April 1962. "Yale 
is no longer an 18th century academy or 
a 19th century college," the report stated. 
"It is a university of the 20th century in 
one of the great nations." If Yale wanted 
to remain a competitive and important 
institution in the modern world, the 
report implied, it would have to rethink its 
policies and make itself more appealing 
to the best and the brightest. The report 
asserted academic meritocracy as the 
essential criterion for admission, and 
even recommended that the college begin 
enrolling women. Finally, Yale was getting 
its priorities straight. 

In this context, the idea and even the 
title of To Be a Man no longer seem like 
chauvinistic glorifications of a bygone 
era, but an attempt to grapple with a 
previous era's lasting imprint. As more 
and more students in the film speak about 
the challenges and rewards of studying at 
Yale, it becomes clear that even in 1966 the 
prototypical Yale Man was fast becoming 
a thing of the past. The film does show 
brief clips of the track and the crew boat, 
traditional haunts of Yalies from the 
1930s, '40s and '50s. But these images are 
overwhelmingly outnumbered by long 
segments of lectures and seminars, the 
camera following a professor as he strides 
up and down the podium or resting on 
the face of a student as he listens to his 
peer make a comment. 

Of course, the Yale Man had not 
vanished from campus. In one particularly 
memorable scene, a freshman who is 
spending the afternoon beating the 
dust out of his rug on the Old Campus 
explains that Yale "is not a coed college. 
It's a men's college." He complains 
about his roommates who "hibernate 
in some room, and sit and read a book 
all day long." But far more typical is his 
classmate, who declares, "I want to be 
put in over my head by the courses I'm 
taking, and by other people. And even 
though I might be destroyed in the 
process, if I come through it, I'll be much 
better for it." This kind of deep desire for 
knowledge doesn't sound too remote; in 
fact, this freshman could fit in just fine at 
the Yale we know today. 

Here lies the film's real twist and 
its most strangely satisfying revelation: 
These students, with their excitement for 
learning and, at times, disproportionate 
seriousness of purpose, are really not too 
different from us. Yes, the mandatory 
suits and ties have disappeared, and the 
campus is now far more diverse in every 
sense of the word. Nevertheless, listening 
in on the conversations and personal 
testimonies of the students in To Be a 
Man feels bewildering in its familiarity, 
almost as if one had recognized oneself 
in an old, beautiful photograph of a 
stranger. 

Did the students featured in To Be a 
Man realize that Yale as they knew 
it was coming to an end? No one talks of 
social revolution, the escalating conflict 
in Vietnam, or the specter of female 
students. They could not have imagined 
students with wild hair and bell-bottoms 
walking through Old Campus, the boys 
draping their arms over the girls' shoulders 
or lounging underneath trees, playing 
guitar and talking. Yet an unconscious 
nostalgia pervades the film. Lerner seems 
to have understood instinctively that he 
was documenting a campus that might 
look decidedly different in a few years. 
When the camera leaves the classroom 
and dorms, it chases after images of Yale 
landmarks like Connecticut Hall and 
Harkness Tower, pointing straight up to 
exaggerate the buildings' monumental 
status, as if in fear that they might 
suddenly disappear. The background 
music alternates between the traditional 
harmonies of the Whiffenpoofs and a 
contemporary jazzy melody. Even the 
students themselves seem pulled between 
the Yale of the past and the Yale of the 
future. "Before I came, I used to listen 
to all the old records," one boy says. "We 
sang, and got together in our tuxedos, 
and we sang 'For God, for country, 
and for Yale,' and seven alumni in the 
audience got up and started waving their 
handkerchiefs, and I'll be damned if I 
didn't feel good about it." His friends 
heckle him for his sentimentality, and 
we might be inclined to join in too. But 
there is a comfort and a pride in the 
customs of an institution that cannot be 
easily denied. "Brewster talks about your 
becoming part of an expanding tradition," 
the singer's roommate offers, as if to 
reconcile the ideas of past and the future, 
"something that you're not yourself fully 
able to change." Expanding tradition: it's 
a wonderful tightrope of a phrase, a kind 
of slogan for the seemingly impossible. 
You are the hinge between the Yale of 
tomorrow and the Yale of yesterday, it 
assures anxious students. And the two 
will be exactly the same, only different.
