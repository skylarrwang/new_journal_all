living in his grandmother's childhood 
home. She remembered his grandmother 
as a little girl. He discovered that his 
grandparents must have had some 
communication 
with 
their 
relatives 
because his cousins had photographs of 
Bustamante from when he was· twelve-
• 
years old. 

Since returning to the U.S., Bustamante · 
has continued to communicate with a 
number of his cousins. Although an 
extremely small portion of the Cuban 
population has access to the Internet, one 
of his cousins can go online because she 
is a doctor. "They're kind of like five years 
behind in Internet culture," he adds, citing 
the chain e-mails that she always sends. 
Now, with the lines of communication 
opened, he can transcribe letters from 
his grandparents and send them to the 
Gmail account his cousins share. "These 
human-to-human ties that are not cooked 
up in some resort hotel is what needs to 
happen," he insists. For Bustamante, the 
most important part of traveling to Cuba 
was realizing, "This is a person. She is 
related to you." 

ustamante went to Cuba to explore 
the murky realities underlying the 
simplistic, polarized Cuba debate in the 
U.S. He went to find answers, to figure 
out which faction of U.S. advocates had it 
right, or to find some different solution. 
Instead, his human ties have given him an 
intimate understanding of the exact same 
"complexity" that McElroy experienced. 
When pushed to make even the mildest 
of judgrnents, Bustamante stumbles over 
his words. "No one likes the government. 
There, no one 
wait 
I take that back. 
Some do, but everyone is frustrated ... 
Part of the problem with the debate is 
that people are forced to try to make 
these generalizations." 

Both 
Bustamante 
and 
McElroy 
articulate the paradoxes 
the ironies in 
the health care system, the tourism, the 
racism, the plight of individual freedom 
in a socialist society. They reject the 
polarized debate between Che-shirt-
wearing revolutionary liberals and the 
hard line, primera-ola, Cuban elite in South 
Florida. Suspicious of a quick fix, the 
students are in search of ways to bridge 
the divide. 

Elizabeth Jordan, who graduated 
October 2007 
from Yale in 2006, traveled to Cuba with 
Bustamante during the summer of 2005. 
She had gone once before with the Yale 
Chaplain's Office on a ·religious visa, and 
' 
went once more on the same permit after 
her ten-week summer trip. Jordan studied 
the 
interactions · between 
Protestant 
churches and the socialist, atheist state. 
She says these experience gave her "a 
more nuanced take on Cuba" and allowed 
her "to see the gray areas." 

Both Bustamante and Jordan continue 
to use the knowledge they gained in Cuba, 
Bustamante at the Council on Foreign 
Relations and Jordan at Human Rights 
First. Jordan is often forced to correct 
the assumption that she stands firmly 
on one side of the debate. Once, while 
speaking to a Cuban exile, Jordan says, 
"I made an offhand comment that I had 
traveled to Cuba." The woman assumed 
Jordan must be a sympathizing leftist. "I 
had to convince her that I wasn't ardently 
Castro." Another time, she was speaking 
with a fellow activist who worked for an 
environmental N GO. "She asked, 'What 
do you think about Cuba?" and she 
thought that I would just say, 'Castro's 
great, go Che!' ... She was surprised that I 
had so much to say." 

Travel to Cuba gives college students 
a unique view of the island and the will 
to change the U.S. policy debate. Barack 
Obama thinks that travel to Cuba is also 
bound to change the political landscape 
of the island. In an op-ed published in 
the Miami Herald in late August, Obama 
argued that removing restrictions on 
Cuban-Americans' family visits to the 
island can only help foster dissidence and 
~ 
a grass-roots movement for democracy. 
If Americans travel to Cuba, Obama 
believes, information w i11 travel with 
them. 

McElroy concurs. ''People are so 
willing and anxious to talk to you," he 
says, noting that the Cuban media leads 
Cubans toward extreme opinions of the 
U.S. He was asked, ''Geraldo, can you 
walk outside in the United States at night 
without the police temng you to go home 
because you'll be shot at?'' And once, he 
says, ''I met a Cuban who was trying to 
defend the war in Iraq to me." 

Ideas from the U.S. manage to 
infiltrate the Cuban psyche despite 
the country's controlled media and 
restricted travel. Undergraduates, Guerra 
argues, are in a unique position to aid 
the exchange. "These students are like 
vehicles of information," she asserts. 
"Undergraduates, 
because 
of 
age, their curiosity, their in fact:__ 
openness. . . they are possessed of a 
number of skills and talents that older 
people just don't have." 

Both Jordan and Bustamante call 
Guerra the "sole ·reason" that Yale 
undergraduates are able to travel to Cuba, 
both because of her tireless advocacy 
of student trips in the face of so many 
obstacles and the support she provides 
students in Cuba about everything from 
contacts and housing to what to wear to 
avoid looking too yuma, or American. 

Ras Raudel, a Cuban friend of 
McElroy, is a member of LA Comision 
Depuradora, a group that works to break 
the silence surrounding racism against 
Afro-Cubanos in Cuba through rap and 
hip-hop at underground concerts. One 
day, McElroy asked him, "How can you 
keep fighting?" Raudel answered, 
'~s 
much oppression as there was in the 
United States, at least they could express 
themselves." Then he began to cry. 

The naivete of American students 
travelingtoCubamakes them approachable 
and allows even older Cubans, the ones 
who have been in the trinchera, or trench, 
with Castro for decades, to ask them 
questions and expect honest responses. 
In May of 2002, Guerra and three of her 
students were riding a bus. The driver 
was dark-skinned. He regarded her three 
students, who were dark-skinned as well, 
with curiosity, and eventually sidled up to 
one of them. 
"So are you really in college?" he 
asked. 
''Yeah," the student replied. 
The driver thought for a moment. 
He was about fifty years old, grateful 
to the revolution for his education. He 
assumed that he wouldn't have gotten 
that education in Cuba without Castro, 
or in the U.S. He said to the student, "I 
didn't know that black people could go to 
college in the U.S."
