Gastronomique's meal plan costs 
fifty dollars per week for five meals, each 
defined as ·either one entree or three 
smaller dishes, such as soups, salads, and 
sides. For a single, crisp Ulysses S. Grant, 
enjoy five Crispy Salmon Steaks over 
creamy risotto. Any menu item is game, 
• except for the 17 -dollar, twelve ounce 
steak frites. A customer who ordered the 
Sesame Crusted Tuna, the menu's second 
most expensive item, for each of his five 
meals could save $32.50 
about forty 
percent 
over the course of the week. 

Though the deal doesn't compare to a 
Happy Meal (and the wait is substantially 
longer than under the Golden Arch), a 
Big Mac has nothing on Gastro's popular 
Crusty Burger. "The Crusty Burger is one 
of the best burgers in town," said Paul 
Schneider, a senior in Trumbull, who lives 
off-campus and is on the Gastro meal plan. 
Plus, the ten-dollar-per-meal deal easily 
trumps the rate of Yale University Dining 
Service, which charges $13.25 for dinner. 
"Compared to the Yale meal plan, it's a 
lot cheaper," said Schneider, who insists 
that his connection to Gastronomique 
"makes the neighborhood feel more 
cohesive." 

While all of the nearly thirty people on 
the Gastronomique meal plan this fall are 
Yalies 
and the service is even billed as 
a "student meal plan" on the restaurant's 
quaintly illustrated take-out menu 
Woll 
emphasizes that the program is not 
exclusively for students; nor is it extended 
only to those affiliated with and employed 
-
by Yale; nor even only to those employed 
at all. "I once had a homeless person on 
the plan," explained Woll, who would 
cash the man's government checks weekly 
in exchange for five gourmet meals. "I'd 
feed him steak." When the loyal customer 
was released seven months after ending up 
in jail mid-week, Woll prepared the meals 
the man had paid for but not eaten. 

"I relate to underdogs," said Woll, 
obliquely alluding to past struggles of 
his own. Yet the laminated newspaper 
clippings that decorate one of the bistro's 
few inches of unused surface area belie 
the notion that Woll has ever been an 
underdog himsel£ In one he is pictured, 
debonair, seated at a table with New 
Haven's most celebrated restaurateurs, 
owners of the swank eats Zinc, Ibiza, and 
Scoozzi. 

October 2007 
Gastronomique is the first restaurant 
that Woll himself has owned, though his 
knack for nosh goes all the way back to 
his childhood kitchentable. "My mother 
would overcook the vegetables, overcook 
the meat," he said. "I would tell her 
'You're burning out all of the nutrients!" 
s ~ so i 
community members have elite taste 
buds but too much on their plate to dine 
out or cook in. From chicken cordon bfeu 
to steak frites, Gastronomique offers an 
extensive menu of sophisticated dishes, 
all of them prepared in a space no larger 
than a Jonathan Edwards single. 

In his teens, Woll attended a trade school 
and specialized in culinary arts. He then 
studied at the Culinary Institute of 
America before doing an externship in 
Europe and working under esteemed 
French chefs in New York City. Mid-
career, in the summer of 2001, a tragic 
motorcycle accident left Woll in a coma 
for three months. Woll slept through both 
planes hitting, both towers falling. When 
he finally woke up, a lot had changed. "I 
decided I didn't want to work for anyone 
else anymore," Woll explained. And so 
began Gastronomique. 

Woll's blueprint for the restaurant 
was very different from his final product. 
His initial vision was a modest one: to be 
a juice vendor on a well-trafficked Elm 
City street corner. "I got turned on by 
an industrial juicer," Woll says, waxing 
poetic 
even borderline pornographic-
~ 
as he describes falling in love with the 
machine. ''The concept of extracting a 
sweet liquid from a hard solid touched 
me." The notion of being at the mercy 
of New England's formidable climate, 
however, was less appealing. So, Woll 
scoped out downtown real estate and 
indulged his tendency toward ambition 
and innovation. 

The very concept of Gastronomique, 
whose epithet "Gourmet take-out'' is a 
seeming oxymoron, is a novel one. It's 
high-quality output with a minimum of 
input, like acing a test without making 
flash cards or looking good in sweatpants 
and a t -shirt. The concept is ingenious 
for a university town, where many

e arson. 

"Restaurateurs come in here and say 
'Oh my God. This guy puts out a huge 
menu, and he's in a closet,"' Woll says 
with a proud smile. And it's true. Out of 
what Woll optimistically calls a "small-
rent" and what others might label an 
aromatic shoebox, Gastro serves light 
and hearty salads, nearly ten kinds of 
sandwiches, 
make-your-own 
b11rgers, 
eight different entrees, a slew · of side 
dishes, and a handful of desserts. Not to 
mention a page worth of fruit juice and 
energy shake offerings, the daily specials, 
and a chalkboard of crepes 
both savory 
and sweet. Oh, and brunch. 

A culinary trendsetter in many ways, 
Woll is not, however, the only restaurant 
owner in the area to offer breaks aimed at 
students. Many of New Haven's eateries 
cater to college-aged clientele trying to live 
cheaply. Both Au Bon Pain and Atticus 
give free handouts of their leftover baked 
goods when the stores close shop at the 
end of the business day, and students 
enjoy ten percent discounts at a handful 
of downtown restaurants if they can 
endure the shame of having their waiters 
examine 
the 
universally 
unattractive 
close-up headshots on Yale IDs. 

Yet Woll's motives are perhaps the 
most humanistic: ''I like people," he says. 
''I feel obligated to feed them."
