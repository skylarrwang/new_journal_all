n his first few days as a summer 
subletter at Sigma Phi Epsilon 
("SigEp"), Nick Coman awoke to 
a harsh banging at the fraternity's back 
door. "I' want your cans," a voice called. 
'~nd your house looks like shit." The 
voice belonged to Kenny Jackson, a 
homeless man and fixture of the High 
Street community. Lanky and emaciated 
after years of cocaine abuse, Jackson 
. had grown accustomed to cleaning up 
fraternity houses for cash. Coman opened 
the door and launched into a two-month 
relationship with the homeless of High 
Street. 
"Kenny must have been used to 
being there and having some sort of 
relationship," Coman reasoned, after 
being stunned. by Jackson's smooth 
approach. This arrangement had, in fact, 
existed since SigEp bought its new home 
at 31 High Street in 2006. The fraternity's 
leaders lauded the. purchase, with former 
Vice-President of Member Development 
Michael Rucker claiming in February 
'of 2006, '~house is important because 
we want to maintain an image that is 
not a crazy-party fraternity but is still a . . 
bit more gentlemanly." A house may be 
important, but cleaning it is. still more 
s~d, evidently, gentlemen don't 
clean. SigEp's former president began 
hiring the homeless just months after the 
· house~warming. 

Current SigEp President Michael 
Schwartzman downplays the relationship 
and insists that "it's never been much of 
an issue." According to SigEp House 
Manager Larry Wise, the real problem 
. stems from the house's property manager, 
Bob Esposito, who pays three or four 
homeless people for labor on a regular 
basis. Schwartzman maintains that he has 
"no knowledge of Bob's involvement with 
homeless people." Esposito, however, 
readily admits to his employment of the 
homeless community. Although SigEp's 
national 
headquarters 
commissioned 
him to keep the property safe, Esposito 
explains, "Yeah, I hire them. Kenny's 
done cleaning for us 
when garbage was 
. 
slimed everywhere and no one wanted to 
touch it, Kenny would grab a trashcan 
and do it. I'd give him ten or twenty 
dollars, no problem." 

Esposito's implicit claim is a common 
one: if these are jobs no one wants, and the 
homeless ne~d the money and are willing, 
is it wrong? Judging from the actions of 
other fraternities, the answer seems to be 
no. SigEp's practices are not unique. Next 
door, at Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Jackson 
and a group of his friends, also homeless, 
spent the night of July 19th raving in the 
basement, taking swigs from half-empty 
beer cans and assuring the brothers, 
"If you leave your beer cans empty, I'll 
break the legs of anyone you want with a 
baseball bat." 

SAE 
President 
Stephen 
Sherrill 
flatly denies these stories and rests firm 
on his conviction that, ''We just haven't 
had an issue with it. We keep our doors 
locked like anyone else." In response to 
allegations that SAE is insta11ing a new 
door because of homeless vandalism, 
Sherrill had no comment. 

To the homeless of New Haven, 
cleaning up 
fraternities 
is 
nothing 
new. Joe Comfort, a 55-year-old street 
legend who assumes an air of authority 
when speaking about eve

osito 
crack habits to vaults of stolen goods, 
dismisses Jackson's involvement with 
SigEp as amateur employment and shares 
his personal story of fraternity servitude. 
According 
to 
Comfort, 
he 
began 
cleaning Sigma Nu about four years ago 
in exchange for a few dollars every now 
and then. Although current Sigma Nu 
President Josh Lederman asserts that 
he has heard nothing of the fraternity's 
history of homeless hiring, Comfort says 
that he eventually moved into the · house 
for several months as a full-time servant 
to the brothers. "I cooked whatever they 
wanted. I fixed their doors, dishwasher, 
windows, and everything." Though he 
enjoyed the incessant parties, Comfort 
found himself performing menial tasks 
for ungrateful brothers. "I cleaned up 
when they fucked up," he sighs. "They'd 
be playing beer pong and they'd puke in 
the drains, and I'd have to clean that shit 
up and wouldn't get a fucking quarter." 

Comfort says his stint at Sigma Nu 
fell apart during one Parents' Weekend. 
Pleased with himself after building a 
wall to hide the brothers' kegs from their 
parents, Comfort stumbled in front of "a 
bunch of rich white daddies." According 
to Comfort, one father turned to his son 
and asked, "Hey boys, who's this nigger?" 
After the brothers explained that Comfort 
helped out and was not a member of the 
Yale community, the father turned away 
from Comfort and told his son, "Get this 
nigger out of here." The current SigNu 
president declined comment. 

Back at SigEp, brothers and subletters 
watched as Jackson grew more attached 
to the building: According to Coman, 
Kenny soon became "the running joke 
of the house." In fact, in weekly e-mails 
rehasing the hazy details of the weekend's 
parties, Jackson was a favorite topic of 
conversation. Following a particularly 
stunning performance on July 21 •t, Coman · 
wrote that "Least Valuable Player goes to 
Kenneth 'Kenny' Jackson for completing 
multiple drug deals in the backyard during 
the party ineluding selling 'purple haze' 
to people for forty dollars per bag. Here's 
to you Kenny, way to be that guy." 

Jackson was ready to help and inched 
his way closer to SigEp this past summer. 
He lingered in the home, and the brothers 
did not complain. On July 20th, Coman 
ra11ied his fellow subletters to host 
another party, exp1aining, "I'm not even 
hung over, and Kenny offered to clean up 
the party this morning." 

Jackson cleaned and the parties 
continued, but a 
series of strange 
incidents in August severed his bond 
to the house. After the laptops of 
two subletters went missing, Jackson 
wandered over and explained that he 
could return the computers for fifty 
dollars, with which he would buy drugs. 
"I thought about it," Coman explains. "I 
figured, two thousand dollar computer 
versus fifty dollars in weed. It wasn't a 
hard decision." Jackson returned hours 
later, empty-handed and heavily beaten 
after trying to retrieve the computers. As 
Jackson roamed around, bloodied and 
blubbering apologies, Coman was at a 
birthday party in Manhattan. 

Fraternity leaders profess to be taking 
a hard line against outside help, but the 
homeless presence persists. Jackson was 
last seen at SAE in September, dangling 
out of a tree and yelling to Coman, "I 
love you, man, I'm sorry, man. I'd do 
fifteen for you, I'd kill for you." Coman 
returned to the inside of the house while 
SAE brothers forced Kenny away. 

Hoping to avoid a ·similar scene, 
Comfort has kept his . distance. But he 
knows that homeless labor is always. 
welcome. "I could go back whenever I 
want," he explains. "But my name isn't 
'nigger.' It's Mr. Comfort." 

Like Sigma Nu, SAE, and the majority 
of other Yale fraternities, SigEp hopes to 
restore its "gentlemanly image." Larry 
Wise resents the rumors of homeless 
help and explains, ''As house manager, 
I'm opposed to having people around 
whom I don't know." Principles aside, the 
seasoned members of the New Haven 
homeless community are well aware of 
Yale's Greek life and their roles as its 
custodians. Indeed, as a July invitation to 
a party at SigEp suggested, "If you need 
directions to SigEp, just ask any homeless 
person."
