's a saying in Arabic: "That 
1s not my apncot; my apncot 1s 
some other apricot." It became 
a favorite of mine and five other interns 
this summer as we worked on the Yale 
Farm. When we were confronted with a 
challenge, the saying made the situation 
clear. It's not that I don't have an apricot:-
I do 
it's just that that's not it. 
The perennial bed was our apricot. 
TheY ale Farm is located on a one-acre 
plot on Edwards Street, off of Prospect, 
just past the last outcrops of Science 
Hill. It's composed of flat beds and 
terraces for annl!al plantings, separated 
by steep drops. These areas, which we 
called berms, are not suited to intensive 
annual culti arion. They can, however, be

fruit trees, 
herbs, flowers; plants 'that survive from 
year to year and by all rights shouldn't 
need much work or attention. The largest 
of these areas, on the farm as well as in 
my mind, is aptly termed the perennial 
bed 
our apricot. It is there that I want 
to be buried. When I die, I want it to 
know that it won. 

first heard of the perennial bed when 
Josh Viertel, co-director of .the Yale 
Sustainable Food Project and chief 
farm manager, gave us interns our first 
tour of the Farm. The six of us were 
preparing to spend the entire summer 
on an acre of green in grey ... ew Haven 
but it had recently been laid to waste by 
the installation of new, frost-free water 
pipes. The usual early spring desolation 
looked more akin to a construction site 
than to the verdant paradise we had been 
promised. Josh casually gestured with the 
left side of his body to the area above the 
stone wall and said, "This is the perennial 
bed. We plant. .. perennials ... in here." 
It would be a while before this barely 
sprouting brown lump began to bloom. 
It would be a while before it became 
the overwhelming presence that circled 
around every morning meeting and every 
lunch break like an albatross. It would be 
a while before I got a sinking feeling as 
I looked at the limp geranium perched 
on the broad blade of a pickaxe I had 
grabbed after pulling so hard on a lump


Our job in the perennial bed was not 
all that different from our responsibilities 
elsewhere on the Farm, nor was it all 
that . much harder. We planted things, 
we weeded, we mulched. It was a simple 
war of attrition to establish the plants we 
wanted over the ones we didn't. Those 
we would kill, and then we would choke 
their children with a thick bed of leaves. 
Though it's a straightforward task, the 
perennial bed had a way of swallowing 
work. We could spend a full eight hours 
hunched over a patch of galansoga only 
to look up and see an area identical to the 
one we had entered eight hours before. 
The weeds grew in big stands that 
looked just like normal plantings. There's 
a unique feeling of terror you get with 
your hand wrapped around the stem of a 
plant, trying to decide whether or not to 
pull it. 'It's so big and healthy,' you might 
think, 'surely, this, this is supposed to be 
here.' I remember a fellow intern waving 
out from amidst the thicket, calling 
another to investigate, and then another, 
and then me. And then the four of us 
gathered, peering and poking at what 
turned out to be sorrel. Josh wandered 
over, yanked it out, gave us a little smile, 
and sauntered off. The next day, a plant 
of equal ferocity had taken its place, 
the mulch having been magically moved 
by some mischievous sprite during the 
night. 

defining characteristics of a 
perennial planting 
are 
also 
its 
most painful. Perennial berms follow 
natural curves rather than the straight 
lines that make annual plantings easy to 
manage. Left without that visual cue, · 
our task became distinguishing various 
green tufts from various green patches, 
most of which appeared native to some 
undiscovered continent. The uneven 
terrain made mulch slip off at the slightest 
provocation, exposing more bare soil to 
house more weeds. A farmer once ·told 
us how we would know we were winning: 
''You feel that sickening feeling in your 
stomach? That's how you know you're 
doing it right." 


This is not to denigrate the perennial 
it's a lovely spot. I hear that blood, 
sweat, and tears make fine fertilizer. Early 
in the summer, the sage on either side of 
the stairs flowered, and the small purple 
blossoms cupped tiny shots of sugar in 
their bases. Josh suggested that we use 
them as a garnish for root beer Boats, 
but that seemed somehow untoward. We 
also had big drifts of oregano, chives, and 
mint. We harvested them and mixed them 
with ricotta every day for lunch. There 
were a lot of stinging nettles, as well. 
I talked to an intern from the previous 
summer who asked about the Farm's 
drainage system. He e:xp1ained how he 
and the rest had dug ditches snaking 
through the acre, installed pipes and 
rocks, and then _covered them back up 
with earth on which the grass once again 
began to grow. It must have taken them 
weeks. Now, all that you can see of their 
project is a lighter strip of less healthy 
grass that cuts across the center of the 
Farm. Soon the grass will grow thick over 
that spot too. Their pipe runs underneath 
the turf, quiedy doing its job. I didn't give 
a second thought to drainage all summer. 
Not my apricot. 

On the last week of the sumrner, we 
put a whole new batch of transplants into 
the ground. By that time, the maintenance 
and mulching had decreased the weed 
pressure, and noticeable patterns had 
begun to emerge &om the small hm. 
With luck, the plants we put in this year 
will survive through winter and come to 
dominate the space next summer. Perhaps 
next year, the interns won't have to put so 
much of themselves into it, because what 
we put in will still be there. Perhaps the lily 
I fell on will still be stunted, a reminder of 
the rage we all poured into that earth. But 
that small sign will fade with time, and 
as the next summer's workers struggle 
to build a bench, or a chicken coop, or 
finally kill the goddamned hornets, or 
grapple with whate:ver apricot they will 
find themselves with, they will have 
beneath them the pieces of myself and 
hundreds of others still left in the soil.
