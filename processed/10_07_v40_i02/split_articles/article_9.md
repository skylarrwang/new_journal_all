I RECEN'ILY SPOTIED A YOUNG WOMAN 0
York Street sporting a shirt emblazoned:
"New Haven: I hear some smart people
live their." I read right; in addition to
Urban Outfitters' one-liner tees, Yale
students and New Haveners are now
sporting a new line of ironic clothing.
On campus and around town, slogan-
bearing shirts, some raunchy and others
ridiculous, are asserting a fierce but self-
amused pride in the Elm City, in much
the same vein as Cornell's popular "Ithaca
is Gorges" t-shirt line. While alumni and
students have long enjoyed a tradition
of Yale gear, only a limited selection of
New Haven memorabilia existed
until
recently. As Jennifer Lahert, manager
of the tourist center Info New Haven,
describes, groups are finally playing to the
long untapped market for New Haven
memorabilia.

Since Town Green Special Services District,
a
group
that
promotes
developrnent in downtown New Haven,
opened Info New Haven ten years ago,
the production of Elm City souvenirs
has taken off. Walgreens now sells a
variety of homespun shirts
provocative
ones read, "New Haven: Friendly with
Benefits"; others cheer in avuncular pastel
font, '~ew Haven
My Kind of Town!"
At Info New Haven, more historically-
inclined tourists and natives can choose
from shirts designed by the Town Green
directors and Info
ew Haven staff,
including '~ew Haven: More Jjke Old
Haven" and the especially popular fitted
tees, available in baby blue and light pink,
"New Haven: Jaywallcing since 1638."
Others opt for a subtler motto, presented
October 2007
in stark black and white, "New Haven:
It's better than your town." The so-called
"Smart Tee," sported by the woman on
..
York Street, is also a favorite. K.atie Rowe, .
the employee at Info New Haven who
conceived of this slogan, first tells me that
it was just an attempt to make a Yale shirt
while avoiding copyright issues but then
· laughs and assur~s me that she's joking.
Like her design, the new tees are aimed at
"various aspects of New Haven."
While the iconic "I 0 New York"
shirts
capture
many
tourists'
pure
excitement from a trip to the Big Apple,
the New Haven slogans reflect the
more ambivalent relationship that exists
between the city and its residents or
visitors. Many feel a familial connection
to the city; they may whine about her or
tease her like an annoying little sister, but
deep down there is some affection, some
loyalty. Jayna Whitcher, a J.E. junior who
appreciates the new line's humor, bought
the "New Haven: My Kind of Town"
sweatshirt. Acknowledging that most
people do not find the city "their kind of
town," she recalls Harvard fans' taunts
at the Game about having to return to
New Haven and disparaging comments
about the city's crime rate and poverty
level from people back home. With an
optimism that matches her shirt's cheer,
Whitcher says, '~ew Haven is an intrinsic
part of a Yalie's experience, for good ~'ind
for bad. But," she adds, "I like to think,
mostly for good."
Students will soon have the chance
to express their feelings for
ew Haven
not only by wearing but also by coining
these catchphrases. Info
-
hopes to expand its t-shirt offerings and
would welcome student submissions for
slogans. One can only imagine the ideas
Yalies would come up with; perhaps:
"The Have
a Must Have!" or "New
Haven is for Muggers"?
However, submitl ing slogans does
not guarantee glory. John, a dedicated
Info
ew Haven employee, suggested a
design with labeled drawings of East and
West Rocks framing the simple, classic:
'' ew Haven Rocks." His pitch was never
printed, but he still hopes it may someday
hit the streets.
