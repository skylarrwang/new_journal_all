A brightly-colored mural of children at play greets visitors to the Toystore on 
Audubon.  A mere ten years ago, Stack was anything 
but a businessman. He had just quit his job 
as a literature professor at SUNY, where 
he had been one of the college's founding 
members. "I had a sense that if I stayed 
there, I was going to go on doing exactly 
the same thing for the rest of my life, and 
I said, 'Oh, fuck that."' The bibliophile 
moved his family to New Haven because 
he loved the Elm City's library, and, for a 
time, he kept himself busy with scholarly 
work. When he became a grandfather, he 
suddenly realized that the city so well-
equipped for the ivory tower was lacking 
in plastic castles. New Haven didn't have 
a single toy store. "The idea that the only 
place people could go to get toys was to the


mass market was really repulsive," Stack 
says. "I found myself running screaming 
out of those places. So I thought, 'What 
the fuck?"' And Toystore on Audubon was 
born. 
We're outside smoking cigarettes as 
he remembers all the people he has been. 
In his going-on-seventy years, he has 
leapt between homes and identities as 
effortlessly as his favorite toy, the flexible 
wooden Voila doll, might be made to leap 
across imaginary stages. A toy store owner 
and a .teacher were the last two things he 
expected to be. "I thought I would be a 
chemist," he muses. "Or an actor." 
Born in Switzerland and raised in 
Montreal, Stack went to college in London 
to study chemistry at the University. He 
worked part-time in a research lab, a job 
for which he remains grateful. ''As a kid, 
I thought I was a chemist. When I went 
to work for this big corporation called 
Glaxo," he snorts, ''I rapidly discovered 
that I was not a chemist." 
It was also in London that he 
discovered the theater, his next great love. 
"I had the mad idea that any cultivated 
person would've seen everything that's 
on, so I saw everything that was on. Of 
course, my chemistry studies suffered 
somewhat." The theater followed him to 
Trinity College, where he studied literature 
and directed the first productions of 
Eugene Ionesco and Jean Genet seen in 
Dublin. Remembering the city in the late 
fifties, he laughs. "It was a piss." 
Dublin was where he fell in love two 
more times: with James Joyce's Ufysses and 
with his first wife. Though he's no longer 
married to the latter, he still maintains 
that Joyce is the greatest writer and most 
remarkable person to ever live. At the time, 
U fysses was banned, and therefore coveted. 
''Ah, it's a wicked, horrible, dirty book," 
Stack says with a relish you wouldn't expect 
of a shop-owner whose main clientele 
is under the age of ten. ''You bought it 
under the table, or in Paris, or whatever. 
It was a blast." 
As for the wife, he flew to New York 
to marry her at the age of 22, and when 
he got off the plane he had the uncanny 
feeling that he .was coming home. ''I had 
been abroad all my life," he says, "and 
in 
ew York, everyone is abroad." They 
moved to Stanford for graduate school,

but eventually made their way back to the 
City, where he married his · second wife. 
"She was a student of mine," he says. 
"I mean, no hanky-panky, but when she 
heard my marriage had disintegrated in 
the '70s 
as most marriages did 
she 
looked me up, and we got along." 
These days, Stack still dabbles in 
scholarly work. He runs an on-line course 
on U!Jsses, and he did a recording of the 
novel for a local TV station .. He will 
catechize about the book to anyone who's 
interested. "It's the only book you can 
study down to the last detail, and it repays; 
it's so rich, so difficult, so completely 
responsible 
and funny, terribly funny!" 
he says. He acts out a scene for me (it's 
a hot day; Bloom is reaching covertly for 
a card stuck in his hat; "Calypso") and 
his laugh is an uproarious staccato that 
echoes in the quiet street. "U!Jsses," he 
says, "is a wonderful toy." 
He also helps international students 
with their dissertations; the papers on his 
desk inside the store belong to Wang Ao, 
a Chinese graduate student writing _about 
late Tang poetry. We talk about China 
for a bit. Though I hold the advantage 
of having been born there, he has a 
knowledge of Chinese history much 
vaster than m y own. He reads history 
voraciously, even more so than fiction 
or poetry. He has created a program to 
address female illiteracy in developing 
countries, which he regards as a wildly 
underappreciated issue . at the heart of 
the AIDS crisis, underdevelopment, and 
unrest in the Muslim world. He asks me 
my major; when I tell him it's Economics 
and Math, he quizzes me about the GDP, 
the national debt, and the growth of 
Yale's endowment. 
I remark that he seems to know a 
lot about eve 
· g, Stacks thinks for a 
while. "Yes, I suppose I do," he agrees. 
Ironically, it's children and business that 
he claims to know the least about. In fact, 
he seems to run Toystore on Audobon 
based on literary principles. When the 
phone rings and a woman asks whether 
the store carries porcelain dolls, he 
recommends what he says is a figure out 
of Henry James: a doll who looks like "a 
rather hopeful young lady just selling out 
for Paris looking for a husband, with her 
wardrobe and a little music bo.x to keep 
her amused on her journey." 
The intellectual toy store owner 
could easily play the part of a Yale 
professor, but he's suspicious of his 
New Haven neighbor. A crusader for 
the authentic and the unconventional, 
he finds the collegiate setting unnaturally 
restrictive. "The competitiveness of the 
undergraduate world has resulted in 
an unfortunate situation where all the 
smarty-pants are in one place," says this 
man, whose willingness to change course, 
to live Without a plan, might seem foreign 
to many Yale students. "I think that's not 
healthy." Stacks is also critical of what he 
calls "a particular kind of smarty-pants ... 
people who are very good at getting good 
grades and SATs and that sort of thing." 
To him, these students, consumers in 
an emerging mass market of education, 
represent a sort of commodification of 
learning. I can't imagine anything could 
be more repugnant to Stack, who reminds 
me that his store is not about learning to 
be a consumer but is about learning to 
play. In this statement, the pieces of this 
human puzzle come together. Finally, 
Stack stacks up. Like U!Jsses' protagonist 
Stephen Dedalus, Stack is, in the words 
of his favorite author, "not born to be a 
teacher." Like the character from whom 
he continues to learn, he is "a learner 
rather."
