**Title: A Saturday at Lucibello’s Italian Pastry Shop**

At Lucibello’s Italian Pastry Shop in downtown New Haven, preparing cakes 
for customers runs like clockwork. The order sheet is taken down from the 
wall, a cake is baked and iced, then placed into a box neatly tied shut with string 
before going into the refrigerator to wait for pickup. On this Saturday morn­
ing, one cake needs extra attention.
“It needs to say ‘Congratulations on passing your driver’s test,’” Isabella Sci­
rocco, a Lucibello’s employee, tells Peter Faggio.

It’s Faggio’s job to fit all of those words in icing onto the little open space 
remaining on top of the cake. I wander anxiously over to the counter where 
the operation is set to take place, still mystified that anyone could fit that many 
words on top of such a small cake.

Faggio doesn’t hesitate. Leaning over, he neatly scripts the congratulatory 
note in pink icing. None of the other employees even notice.

I let out a deep sigh of relief.

“When you have been doing it as long as I have…” Faggio trails off with a 
laugh after seeing my reaction.

Peter is a second-generation owner of the Lucibello’s. The pastry shop orig­
inally opened in 1929, and Peter’s father, Frank Faggio, purchased it in 1959 
after growing up working in the business. 
These photographs show a typical Saturday at the historic pastry shop, which 
brings tourists, students, and New Haven locals together to enjoy authentic 
Italian pastries.
