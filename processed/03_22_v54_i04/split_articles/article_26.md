“Is this love,” O’Hara wrote, 
“Now that the first love has finally died,
Where there were no impossibilities?”

After you have swum and drowned
Diving in will terrify—
There’s marble at the bottom, dear:
Your bones and heart will break on stone.

but maybe we can float, you say—
Hoping such a thing exists
when broken hearts have come and gone 
and come again. 

You’ll dive in somewhere else, you say
The poet got it wrong— 
There’s one thing left for you to do 
You’ll find another river. 


**Title: Discharge Upgrades: The Military's Broken System**
**Author: Elena DeBre**

centages seem high, a source for 
the defense in the Manker case 
says it’s important to remember 
the staggering number of appli­
cations being submitted to the 
boards for review. Over 60,000 
veterans became eligible to reap­
ply to the boards when the Ken­
nedy settlement was finalized, so 
even if the board only accepts 15 
percent of the applicants, that’s 
still nine thousand people who 
are getting discharge upgrades. 
“It’s a false premise that the board 
doesn’t grant a lot of these,” the 
defense source says. “The people 
on the discharge review boards 
want to do the right thing for the 
veteran.”

Sixty thousand applications are 
a lot for the five members of the 
Army Discharge Review Board 
to slog through. The five officers 
currently sitting on the Naval 
Discharge Review Board may 
likely be hit with similar numbers 
once the Manker case is finalized. 
A case like Burke’s, if accepted 
into the settlement class, might 
not be re-evaluated for another 
three years, Burke predicts. The 
review boards are overworked and 
understaffed, Carson explains, so 
an inundation of cases means that 
each one will likely only get a few 
minutes of review, likely leading 
to mistakes and oversights. “It’s so 
difficult to do right, to do justice, 
when you’re giving such brief 
attention to the case,” Carson 
notes.

‘Should They Suffer 
That Penalty For Their  
Remaining Lives?’

This quick decision by the dis­
charge board can have life-altering 
repercussions. A less-than-Hon­
orable discharge strips service­
members of VA benefits and job 
prospects—some hiring managers 
require servicemembers to release 
their discharge status. Experts 
and studies say a less-than-Hon­
orable discharge status is one of 
the strongest factors causing vet­
eran homelessness. Carson thinks 
that re-resourcing the review 
boards may help break the cycle 
of rejection that traps so many 
less-than-Honorably 
discharged 
veterans. But a former official for 
the Navy speculates that the solu­
tion lies in a broader probing of 
the punitive discharge process 
as a whole. If the misbehavior of 
veterans is a symptom of risking 
their lives for their country, should 
the rest of their lives be ruined as 
a result?

Burke held out faith that the 
Yale settlement would help him 
upgrade his discharge status, but 
his original rejection from the 
NDRB was too recent for him 
to join the Manker settlement 
class. His faith now lies beyond 
the military and its flawed justice 
system. He’s a pastor of the Nor­
field Congregational Church and 
does advocacy work resettling 
Afghan refugees in Connecti­
cut. Even if his own chances for 
honor in the eyes of the military 
are now slim, he still hopes others 
will be granted a chance for honor 
through the Manker settlement. 
All the settlement needs to suc­
ceed is the judge’s  stamp of final 
approval. Burke’s praying for it.
