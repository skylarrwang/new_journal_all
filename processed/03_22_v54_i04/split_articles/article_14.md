I missed three trains. In the underground network 
of Penn Station, I befriended a man from the Virgin 
Islands as we both failed to find the same platform. We 
were in matching black coats, and the two of us each 
assumed the other was a native New Yorker. He asked 
me for directions one floor below the voided track, 
where the thick train air settled and shoved warmth 
through our coats. I could not hear him; humidity 
muffled his voice. Together we sat on the second C 
train uptown, after the first left without us, and rode 
the fifty minutes to Queens from Midtown Manhat­
tan. He rode one stop further than I, and we waved as 
I left the emptied train before him. 
My flight from New York to Salt Lake City departed 
and passed without disruption. I seemed to close my 
eyes and wake up above the glowing grid that was 
Utah. On the ground I saw my father again—I hadn’t 
seen him since Thanksgiving. He only knows how 
to communicate through email, and I’m not fantastic 
at checking mine. He flew from Los Angeles, which 
we’ve both called home our whole lives. Salt Lake 
City was not our destination. It was a pit-stop on the 
way to visiting my mother’s side of the family for the 
holidays. They live in Bigfork, Montana—in the razed 
northwestern glacial floodplains of the Flathead Val­
ley, just a couple hours south of the Canadian border. 
On the flight with him, I fell and out of sleep. 
Our plane was delayed two hours because of a snow­
storm in the valley; he shook me awake before we 
landed and ordered me to tighten my seatbelt. The 
slight fear in his voice rose and fell and, above his 
mask, the light of his computer shone in his reading 
glasses. He remarked that landings on snowy runways 
are rough. Be prepared, he said. 
It was about 1:30 a.m when the pilot gurgled some­
thing over the loudspeaker. The seatbelt sign was on, 
and with the adjacent “wifi” and “no smoking” icons, 
the roof of the plane was patterned in red, white, and 
blue light trios. My dad returned to his crossword, 
switched seats with me so I could watch the snowfall 
out the window. He’s touching retirement now. 
Here, flying above the distant, agricultural regions 
of the Rockies, sodium vapor gas bulbs lit sparse barns 
down below. In the summer, farmers sow the fields 
with canola seeds and harvest the flowers to make 
oil. The ochre halos dimmed under the night-grayed 
blanket of snow. With each rush of wind on the plane, 
my anxiety seized and convinced me that this was the 
end. Soon, it said, we will join the rusted lights in the 
snow. Soon, there will be the most fantastic crash on 
that rural runway platform.
