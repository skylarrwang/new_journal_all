job soon became a nightmare. She 
noticed that the DoC essentially 
had no enforceable code for the 
care of incarcerated people and the 
system resisted delivering actual 
treatment. 
Kevnesha 
witnessed 
and heard accounts of myriad abu­
sive practices. An inmate told her 
that when they flushed their toilet, 
the feces would come up in the 
water fountain because the pipes 
were connected. Punching the 
wall became a common practice, as 
inmates injured themselves to dis­
tract from their deeper existential 
pain. She says someone once told 
her “I just needed to see blood, 
because sometimes I can't tell if 
I'm alive.” Another patient said, “I 
didn't want to kill myself until I 
got on suicide watch.”

Day after day, she was unable 
to provide the health care peo­
ple needed: The DoC policy 
only allowed her to meet with 
her patients once a month, pri­
vacy was never guaranteed, call­
ing her clients by their first name 
wasn’t allowed, and the people she 
wanted to work with didn’t always 
trust her. 

“It started to change how I was 
showing up as a mental health pro­
fessional,” Kevnesha recalled. “It 
started to change how I was treat­
ing people, it started to change 
how I was thinking, and ultimately 
it started to change me personally, 
my relationships, my ability to 
sleep, my ability to be at ease.” 
Kevnesha’s anxiety worsened, 
and she started to become paranoid 
about losing her medical license 
because she knew she was deliver­
ing a low level of care. As a mental 
health counselor herself, she started 
going to therapy.

There are some memories that 
Kevnesha still agonizes over. Kev­
nesha met Robby and became 
friends with him during his incar­
ceration from September 2018 to 
January 2019. She remembered 
Robby’s gentle, naive behavior, 
remembered Robby’s love for his 
mother, that he always looked for­
ward to family visits, and that he 
wanted to get better. Kevnesha 
wasn’t there the morning Robby 
died, but when she came in for 
the evening shift, she became dis­
traught at the level of indifference 
at the prison. There was no discus­
sion, no mourning. Officers went 
about their days, talking about 
Robby’s death without any regard 
for him as a human. That was Kev­
nesha’s last straw. Soon after that, 
she resigned from the DoC. She 
later joined SSCT and submitted 
testimony in support of the PRO­
TECT Act.

Solitary confinement is more 
than a punitive practice; it is a sys­
tem that teaches incarcerated peo­
ple violence instead of rehabilita­
tion. And it brings out the worst 
part of correctional officers, who 
were once normal citizens. It dam­
aged the bodies and minds of Tra­
cie, Ray, and Michael. For Kev­
nesha and Robert Gillis, a former 
warden who worked with DoC for 
36 years, not a day goes by without 
them thinking about their involve­
ment with solitary confinement, 
which compromised their ethical 
values and made them more cal­
lous. Fundamentally, solitary con­
finement calls into question what 
we believe to be the purpose of the 
criminal justice system: punish­
ment or rehabilitation? 

As Tracie wrote in a poem: 
“Can’t I the devil confess that you 
are Lord / and I too taste in Heav­
ens reward / Can we finally bridge 
the gap between Heaven and hell / 
Can’t I the devil bask in your for­
giveness as well?” 

In March 2020, the state attor­
ney’s office released a report on 
Robby’s death investigation. The 
report concluded that “based on 
the independent review of all the 
investigative materials, it is the 
opinion of the State’s Attorney 
that no actions of any individual 
Department of Corrections official 
can be determined to be a prox­
imate cause in the death of Mr. 
Talbot…  no criminal charges will 
be brought with respect to Mr. 
Talbot’s tragic death.” 

On a sunny afternoon in Jan­
uary, Colleen recounted Robby’s 
story to me. We sat in her condo 
by the Long Island Sound, star­
ing out across the blue. As we 
watched the footage of Robby’s 
death, she closed the curtains—it 
was “too sunny.” By the time we 
pulled them open, it was 5PM, 
and the sky was painted a mel­
ancholic blue. We fell silent. We 
paused the interview to watch 
the sun set above the sea—the sky 
turned vibrant yellow, blazing 
orange, and then bloody red as 
the sun burnt through the clouds. 
And then, it calmed down. There 
was pure, thick darkness, and we 
resumed our conversation.
