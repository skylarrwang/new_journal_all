gurney, more people wanted to 
see Snowden than ever before in 
his life. “I think I was actually ser­
ving not in a medical therapeutic 
way, but in a sort of existential 
therapeutic way,” Snowden says. 
“People found it, in a way, really 
comforting to talk about the past.”
By the end of April, Snowden 
had appeared in the New Yorker, 
mic departments, all desperate to 
ask—“Has this happened before?”

If you ask Frank Snowden to 
whom the name “Frank Snow­
den” really belongs, he might say 
his father, Frank M. Snowden, Jr.: 
esteemed historian of the lives of 
Black people in antiquity; pro­
fessor of classics at Howard Uni­
versity from 1940 to 1976; Dean 
of Howard’s college of liberal arts 
from 1956 to 1968; and cultural 
attaché for the U.S. State Depart­
ment from 1954 to 1956, in Rome.
If you had asked Frank M. 
Snowden, Jr. to whom the name 
“Frank Snowden” really belon­
ged, he might have said his father, 
Frank M. Snowden the first: a son 
of sharecroppers born in 1884 
in Virginia; 1907 graduate of M 
Street High School in Washin­
gton, D.C.; enlistee in the First 
World War; senior Black officer 
at Camp Lee in the second; sma­
ll-scale real estate entrepreneur 
thereafter; and grandfather to 
three grandchildren who referred 
to him only as “Colonel.”
In 1909, Charles W. Eliot—
then president of Harvard Uni­
versity—published a collection of 
fifty books, classic works of litera­
ture, oratory, and history that, as 
he proclaimed in a 1910 adverti­
sement, could “give any man the 
essentials of a liberal education, 
even if he can devote to them but 
fifteen minutes a day.” Colonel 
read them cover-to-cover. And 
while the Harvard Classics served 
him well, he wanted for his chil­
dren a liberal arts education made 
of more than paper. When his son, 
Frank, Jr., approached schooling 
age, Colonel relocated the family 
from Yorktown, Virginia to Bos­
ton, 
Massachusetts—and, 
most 
importantly, the Boston public 
education system. 
At Colonel’s behest, Frank, Jr., 
went to Harvard. In the 1920s, 
Harvard, at the wish of President 
Abbott 
Lawrence 
Lowell—the 
great Dr. Eliot’s successor—had 
re-segregated the College’s dorms, 
so Frank, Jr. commuted to class 
from Roxbury, Massachusetts. He 
would graduate with a bachelor’s 
degree in classics in 1932, a mas­
ters in 1933, and later, a doctorate, 
in 1944. 
By the time of Frank the third’s 
birth in 1946, Frank, Jr.’s appoint­
ment at Howard had already brou­
ght the Snowdens back to Was­
hington. But Colonel’s wish to 
create at any cost a lineage of suc­
cess stories—to personally produce 
some small part of what W.E.B. 
Du Bois (a friend to Frank, Jr.) 
called the “talented tenth” of Black 
leaders—would follow the Snow­
dens far beyond Boston.
At first, Frank the third atten­
ded Lucy Diggs Slowe Elemen­
tary 
School, 
in 
Washington, 
D.C., an all-Black public school. 
When it came time for school to 
get serious, Frank was sent to St. 
Albans, an all-white preparatory 
school—at least until Frank’s arri­
val. Then eleven years old, Frank 
was informed that if he failed at 
St. Albans, the school would never 
admit a Black student again. “It 
gave me this absurd sense that I 
had a whole people riding on my 
shoulders,” says Snowden. “I lear­
ned to work hard, to take studies 
very seriously, and also to bear 
with quite a lot of abuse.”
In 1964, Snowden, realizing the 
patrilineal fate to which he was 
bound, enrolled at Harvard. “I 
thought of going somewhere else,” 
he says. “But I thought my father 
would die of apoplexy.” (Trans­
lation: have a stroke.) During 
Snowden’s four years in college, 
the Wall Street Journal, NPR, Vox, 
the Washington Post, and dozens 
of other American publications. 
Internationally, he spoke with 
journalists from Germany, Argen­
tina, Korea, and Iran. Snowden 
estimates that he took part in some 
150 interviews that year with 
reporters and writers and acade­

THE  NEW  JOURNAL
Colonel called him once a semester 
just to ask if he had been induc­
ted into Phi Beta Kappa yet. When 
his grandson eventually delivered 
the good news, Colonel replied, 
“That’s good, Frankie. That’s all I 
wanted to know,” before hanging 
up.
Snowden entered college as a 
steadfast “Kennedy Democrat,” the 
hopeful winds of the civil rights 
movement at his back. At first, he 
did not understand the purpose 
behind the bloodshed of the war in 
Vietnam, but there had to be a pur­
pose, however inscrutable. Vio­
lence on that scale does not happen 
without reason, he thought. 
On April 25, 1967, he chan­
ged his mind. Sitting in a Harvard 
auditorium, watching McGeorge 
Bundy—National Security Adviser 
to Presidents Kennedy and John­
son, central architect of the war—
giving non-answer after non-
answer, claiming that he couldn’t 
remember what he had written 
in the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, 
saying that he could not decide 
if, given the chance, he would do 
anything differently in the run-up 
to the wholly optional conflict that 
would go on to claim over eight 
hundred thousand lives.
On April 25, 1967, Snowden 
learned that his father’s self-evi­
dent truth, that America “was 
changing and would get better, 
that America was at-least self-co­
rrecting,” that things necessarily, 
eventually improve, might not be 
so self-evident. 

In the two years since it was 
published, Epidemics and Society 
has been translated into Chinese, 
Greek, Korean, Japanese, Russian, 
Portuguese, Turkish, and Italian. 
To date, the book—a six-hundred-
page academic text published by 
a niche university press—has sold 
over thirty-one thousand copies. 
Snowden is already working on 
another book, also for Yale Press, 
titled COVID-19: Origins of a Glo­
bal Pandemic.

In March 2020, when Snow­
den’s tidal wave of interview 
requests began, everyone wanted 
to know: Has this happened before? 
But they also wanted to know 
something else: What next? How 
do pandemics end? “It’s a very mis­
leading question,” says Snowden. 
“My best answer is that there is no 
such thing as pandemics in gene­
ral, and therefore no rule. Each one 
is different, and ends in a different 
way—if indeed it does.”
We have now lived two years 
in the kingdom of the sick and, 
in doing so, have grown used to 
its metaphors, grown comforta­
ble in them. And as that central 
question—How does this end?—has 
grown more pressing, we have 
seen a new set of metaphors crop 
up: COVID as the loss of twen­
ty-first century innocence, the 
pandemic as a modern day Pan­
dora’s Box, the wet-market bat as 
Eve’s apple in the Garden of Eden, 
too-little-too-late containment as 
original sin—all reconstructing the 
pandemic as a moral, not epide­
miological event.
“​We have to use metaphors, but 
we need to be very careful about 
which ones and think carefully 
about what we're implying,” says 
Snowden. The COVID-as-plague 
metaphor—a metaphor so com­
mon that we’ve all but forgotten 
that plague is a real disease and not 
a category—is a prime offender. 
So too are the societal-ill-as-pla­
gue comparisons (racism-as-di­
sease, traffic accidents-as-plague, 
etc.) that have been en vogue since 
March 2020. “Traffic accidents are 
not a freak of nature, they are a 
product of design,” says Snowden. 
“It gives an entirely wrong diag­
nosis of the problem.”
Frank Snowden is not Nostrada­
mus. The prediction that he made 
at the end of his lecture in 2010—
that we were likely to see another 
epidemic in this century, and that 
it would likely be an airborne 
disease, something like avian flu or 
SARS—was not divination. It was 
extrapolation. 
Snowden, for one, is among 
the crowd that believes that we 
“cannot go back” to life before 
COVID-19. And though he turns 
to metaphor—particularly the Gar­
den of Eden—to make sense of it, 
his reasoning is not metaphorical. 
Only one disease has ever been 
eradicated by human action: small­
pox. COVID-19 is a highly infec­
tious, airborne disease with animal 
reservoirs, frequent mutations, and 
access to an irreversibly intercon­
nected world—in other words, “a 
very poor candidate for eradica­
tion,” Snowden says.
If not eradication, then what? 
There is a version of the future in 
which we listen to Frank Snow­
den’s answer. In the short run, 
we vaccinate everyone, mask and 
social distance as needed, improve 
ventilation in our buildings, and 
reduce our encroachment upon 
animal habits and reservoirs of 
disease. In the long run, we manage 
COVID for the most part, stamp 
out flare-ups, and bolster our glo­
bal institutions to effectively limit 
outbreaks of new diseases. We, in 
Snowden’s words, “take responsi­
bility for the world we’ve created.” 
Epidemics are neither moral nor 
metaphorical events; they hold all 
the significance we assign them 
and nothing more. “Diseases have 
no agency,” says Snowden. “They 
depend on us.”
There is a version of the future 
in which we listen to Frank Snow­
den, in which we do all of the 
things he suggested, and there is a 
version of the future in which we 
do none of them. There is a version 
that falls somewhere in between, 
where we slouch neither towards 
utopia nor armageddon, where we 
land neither in the kingdom of the 
sick nor the kingdom of the well 
but in the place between them, 
the place where—as history and 
Snowden would suggest—we’ve 
always resided.
