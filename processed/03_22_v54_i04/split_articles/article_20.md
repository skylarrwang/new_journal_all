“W
hat was Oak Street like?” 
former New Haven mayor 
Richard Lee asks his viewers in a 
short film made by his campaign 
in the nineteen-sixties. The film 
is black and white, stored in the 
Manuscripts and Archives depart­
ment at Yale, and shows the 
changes made to Oak Street under 
Lee’s administration. “It's almost 
impossible to describe how awful 
it was.”

In the film, Lee provides the 
voiceover as aerial footage of Oak 
Street, which divides the Hill 
neighborhood from downtown, 
before and after his administra­
tion’s urban renewal projects plays 
across the screen. In the foot­
age from before renewal, a man 
sleeps on the street, trash is scat­
tered around, and the camera peers 
inside dark, old-fashioned homes. 
Lee mourns the fact that there 
were people living subpar lives in a 
community that he believes should 
have been cleared out years ago. 
In the “after” footage, the homes 
and buildings are gone, replaced 
by clean but desolate streets. Lee 
praises plans for new commercial 
buildings, new apartments and 
the headquarters of a telephone 
company. He describes the new 
highway, efficient and conducive 
to long-distance travel, in place of 
the area’s once-crowded streets. 
When the old buildings finally 
fell, Lee says he thought of the 
early settlers, who tore down trees 
hundreds of years ago and cleared 
this land for “a better tomorrow.” 
In Lee’s view, mid-century urban 
renewal projects like this one 
were a continuation of the proj­
ect begun in colonial times, where 
destruction was justified to make 
way for progress. 

In 1959, the city, under Lee’s 
leadership, began construction of 
the Route 34 Expressway, collo­
quially referred to as the Oak Street 
Connector. This stretch of high­
way was intended to extend Route 
34 from Interstate 95 through New 
Haven. Construction continued 
through the nineteen-seventies 
until federal funding dried up. 
Now, the Connector is stuck at a 
mile long, leading nowhere.

Oak Street is a part of the greater


Sixty years ago, New Haven destroyed a community to build an 
expressway. Now, the City has set its sights on Oak Street again.
