Hill neighborhood, and its demo­
lition displaced 881 families, most 
of whom were working class, 
and 350 businesses. Renters could 
receive support from the city’s 
relocation services in finding new 
housing, but the requirement that 
it be affordable and of reasonable 
quality meant that some families 
were forced to move to neighbor­
hoods far from their communities. 
Homeowners received the market 
value of their property, but prop­
erty values plummeted when news 
broke of the urban renewal proj­
ects and people stopped investing 
in the area. Most businesses simply 
shut down, as they received little 
compensation and were no longer 
guaranteed the customer base that 
had made them successful.  
Many families chose to find their 
new homes without the help of the 
city, so it’s difficult to know where 
they ended up. Francesca Ammon 
is a historian of urban renewal at 
the University of Pennsylvania, 
and during our interview, she said 
that most former Oak Street resi­
dents who could be tracked ended 
up in physically better housing, 
but were less happy. “They had 
trouble making friends and missed 
where they had been,” she said. 
“And that’s a typical story across 
the country.” 
Another renewal project in 
Wooster Square displaced Theresa 
Argento’s first-generation Italian 
American family. Her family relo­
cated to the Annex neighborhood 
in New Haven, but it never felt 
quite right, she explained during 
recorded testimony in the New 
Haven Oral History Project. “It 
was lovely. We had all the mead­
ows. It was really beautiful and 
my mother was so unhappy. So 
unhappy. She thought we took her 
to California.”
The Connector’s construction 
destroyed communities and didn’t 
yield the economic benefits offi­
cials thought it would—in large 
part because it was never com­
pleted. It cut off the Hill neigh­
borhood from the rest of down­
town, and the neighborhood’s 
economy suffered both as a result 
of Oak Street’s demolition and the 
neighborhood’s effective isolation 
from the rest of the city. The Hill 
remains one of the poorest neigh­
borhoods in New Haven, with a 
poverty rate above 40 percent. 
Now, decades after residents’ 
lives were uprooted, the city is 
trying to rectify the harm inflicted 
by the Oak Street Connector. 
The Downtown Crossing Project 
began under former mayor John 
Destefano, Jr.’s administration in 
2013, and its goal is to remove the 
truncated highway and transform 
it into walkable and bikeable bou­
levards. 
But no amount of retroactive aid 
can undo the damage done to those 
displaced by the city’s decision to 
prioritize 
wealthy 
suburbanites 
commuting to the city for com­
merce over the inner-city, work­
ing-class residents of Oak Street. 
The community included many 
Italian and Jewish immigrants, as 
well as a number of Black families. 
Samuel Slie, who died in 2019 at 
the age of 93 and was a pastor at 
the Church of Christ in Yale Uni­
versity, spoke about his childhood 
on Oak Street for the New Haven 
Oral History Project. In the tape, 
he discusses how his family lived 
on the second floor of a house with 
a tailor shop on the bottom floor, 
owned by a Jewish man with an 
Irish assistant. He described the 
schools, houses, stores, factories, 
Oak Street before demolition, c. 1950-1960. Courtesy of the Yale Library
