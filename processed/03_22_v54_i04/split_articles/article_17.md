“Everyone who is born holds 
dual citizenship, in the kingdom 
of the well and in the kingdom of 
the sick. Although we all prefer to 
use only the good passport, soo­
ner or later each of us is obliged, at 
least for a spell, to identify oursel­
ves as citizens of that other place.” 
In 1975, three years before she 
published Illness as Metaphor, the 
book that contains the pair of 
sentences above, Susan Sontag 
learned that she was dying of can­
cer. Sontag wrote to eviscerate 
the ubiquitous metaphors (ill­
ness-as-battle, patient-as-warrior, 
cancer-as-demonic-pregnancy, 
etc.) that surrounded and, in her 
view, obscured our understanding 
of illness. She was concerned not 
with the actual geography of the 
“kingdom of the ill,” the tangible 
experience of life with disease, but 
the “lurid metaphors with which it 
has been landscaped.”

Frank M. Snowden III is a 
political scientist by training and 
medical historian by happens­
tance. In 2007, when he was 
named the chair of Yale’s Program 
in the History of Science and 
Medicine, he quipped to his wife 
that his appointment was a sign 
of how far the program had sunk. 
“I’d just been made the chair, and I 
didn’t have a degree in history, or 
science, or medicine,” he says with 
a smile. Snowden has spent forty 
years studying epidemics and the 
societies in which they occur, 
in other words, the actual—not 
metaphorical—kingdoms of the ill.
Infectious 
diseases 
“are 
as 
important to understanding socie­
tal development as economic cri­
ses, wars, revolutions, and demo­
graphic change,” he writes in the 
introduction to his 2019 tome, 
Epidemics and Society: From the 
Black Death to the Present, a six-
hundred-page synthesis of Snow­
den’s decades of teaching his­
tory undergraduates with limited 
knowledge of science and science 
the 
pandemic 
next time
Frank Snowden, a professor emeritus in Yale’s 
History of Science and Medicine Program, studied 
epidemics and social change for decades. When 
the pandemic hit, his work gained new relevance.
