a clearer resolution. In avoiding 
narrative 
contrivance, 
Renaud 
must contend with the weakened 
state of today’s Left, preoccupied 
as it often is by cultural concerns 
with little organizational content. 
Renaud attempts in his epilogue 
to find a 21st-century American 
thread in the Occupy movement, 
Black Lives Matter (BLM), and 
recent electoral interest in dem­
ocratic socialism among young 
people. Nevertheless, even these 
phenomena became defanged in 
faux cultural disputes. The culture 
Neoleftists tried, failed, and 
tried again in a seemingly 
endless quest to remain 
forever young, authentic, 
and true to their utopian 
aspirations.
wars of today’s online Left seem 
very much an unfortunate inheri­
tance of the sixties New Left, and a 
distraction from the material stakes 
that preoccupied the neoleftists of 
the antifascist years. 
Through its novel intergenera­
tional scope, New Lefts expands our 
understanding of the 20th-cen­
tury left to include projects at the 
fringe of the workers’ movement. 
After reading, though, I found 
myself grappling with the ques­
tion of where we go from here. 
The Occupy movement invited 
national ridicule before fizzling 
out. Despite Occupy’s subtler leg­
acy in activist and electoral circles, 
few would so-publicly threaten 
Wall Street’s fiscal supremacy until 
the Gamestop stock surge earlier 
last year—an effort spearheaded 
by capitalistic Reddit speculators. 
The material demands of the early 
BLM movement, rooted in police 
abolition and community control, 
would also give way in the public 
imagination to corporate “anti-rac­
ist” commitments that lent them­
selves easily to movement capture 
by cultural elites. This is not to say 
that cultural commitments mean 
nothing; we should challenge our 
comrades’ shortcomings. But pre­
occupation with cultural reforms 
rings especially hollow amid the 
dissonance between our circum­
stances and our discourse. I wonder 
if New Lefts in some way reveals 
where this dissonance came from.

**Title: Suburban Car Service Station at the Edge of the World**

POEM
SUBURBAN CAR SERVICE STATION AT  THE EDGE OF  THE WORLD
BY ELLA GOLDBLUM
I.
At the edge of the world
there is a suburban car service station,
masked attendants waving entry to dehydrated vehicles. I drove there today to touch the 
nervous mechanic with my eyes—I don’t know, anymore, where to put my love for other people. He averted his 
gaze; I examined myself in the rearview mirror instead. It was so humid at the 
service station,
I began to crave my own spit.
Once, I fell so hard for someone
I was convinced I was driving off a cliff. 
Months later we went silent on the phone. I became my own traffic island, circling the lush green
trees in the neighborhood. They are way too alive, 
I wanted to scream at their creator. 
II.
When you can’t smell the dead bodies in the air, you pray to God for reasonable things: 
drive-thru Chick-Fil-A, bag of waffle fries, slushie at the 7-11 off the third highway exit. 
The only natural reaction is to tune the radio to the perfect station: 
the music, not the news, 
so if the world ends this afternoon,
you will be the last to find out.

THE  NEW  JOURNAL
EDWARD B. BENNETT III 
MEMORIAL FELLOWSHIP
Do you have a story that you want to tell about  Yale or New Haven that requires in-depth reporting be­
yond the Elm City? Then apply for the Edward B. Bennett III Memorial Fellowship! For an EBMF-sup­
ported article, think about the national implications of local stories. The Fellowship commemorates 
the late Edward “Edder” B. Bennett III, Yale College Class of 1983, who revived The New Journal after 
a period of dormancy and served as its publisher in the early nineteen-eighties. For an EBMF-support­
ed article, think about the national implications of local stories. You might propose investigating how 
a particular issue pertinent to New Haven has been felt in other cities, or how Yale has influenced (or 
been influenced by) a far-away place like Singapore or Sitka.  
Fellows are expected to publish their articles in The New Journal within six months of receiving the 
award. Applications for summer projects will be due by May 15, 2022. Please email them to 
thenewjournal@gmail.com. Please also feel free to reach out with any questions!
Your application, due to us by May 15, 2022, should include the following: 
1.	 A one-page proposal for the article you would like to write. Please tell us: what the article is about, 
how the article relates to Yale or New Haven, what the overarching questions will be, why this arti­
cle should be written now, and why you think it is nationally significant. 
2.	 A writing sample, either journalistic or academic. (If you have it, journalism is highly preferred.) 
3.	 A budget detailing likely reporting expenses—such as transportation, court document fees, transla­
tion fees, or anything else. Please describe in detail how travel would enhance your proposed story. 
We expect awards to be on average around $1,000—if you have a strong proposal that requires 
more support, please be specific in explaining why.
