**Title: LESSONS FROM A FRACTURED LEGACY**
**Author: DANIEL INOJOSA**
**Page number(s): 41-42**

Caleb Maupin occupies a 
strange position in the left­
ist online mediascape. A 
journalist, author, and self-de­
scribed “political analyst” with 
clear 
authoritarian 
sympathies, 
his work has drawn accusations of 
anti-Semitism, transphobia, rac­
ism, and other forms of bigotry, 
rendering him an undesirable rep­
resentation of the Left.  His most 
recent work, which one might 
generously 
call 
‘investigative,’ 
claims to uncover CIA connec­
tions among leftist Internet per­
sonalities and only attempts to sow 
further discord. Maupin and other 
mud-slingers like him within the 
so-called “online left” are thorny 
obstacles in the milieu’s ongoing 
struggle to draw lines of solidarity. 
Calls for unity occasionally surface 
amid this sea of discord. Yet for all 
their urgency, they ring hollow so 
long as their subject—the online 
forum—is 
divorced 
from 
real 
organizational forms, like those 
that characterized the twentieth 
century Left. If the Left must live 
up to its twentieth-century legacy 
through unity, that legacy first has 
to be understood in a way that 
rejects nostalgia.


Rather than cling to illusions 
of unity, Terence Renaud—a lec­
turer in the Humanities and mem­
ber of Directed Studies faculty at 
Yale—pushes his audience to tune 
into the discord that has always 
fractured the international Left. 
New Lefts: The Making of a Rad­
ical Tradition charts a “third strain” 
of twentieth-century European 
ideological history, which stakes 
its place between the mid-century 
collapse and restabilization of cap­
italism on one end and the rise of 
Soviet Communist hegemony on 
the other. This third strain finds 
its character in a myriad of small 
organizations, through both their 
commitment to radical internal 
democracy and intergenerational 
conflict. 

Renaud’s “New Lefts” ebb and 
flow across generations. The anti­
fascist block in nineteen-thirties 
Germany gave way to the post­
war transition to Social Democ­
racy in the fifties, and then to 
the countercultural fervor of the 
sixties. Though “neoleftists”—a 
term coined by Renaud to refer 
to fringe heterodox Marxists—
adopted tactics ranging from clan­
destine conspiracy to radical face­
less democracy, their overarching 
goal always was to overcome the 
inactivity 
of 
existing 
work­
ing-class political institutions and 
their partisan squabbles—to break, 
in Renaud’s words, “bureaucratic 
sclerosis.”

Renaud avoids inundating the 
reader with the names and histories 
of so many leftist organizations, 
instead grounding the beginning 
of his narrative through the ideo­
logical development of one Hun­
garian Marxist, Georg Luk ács. 
By charting the life of this chief 
intellectual protagonist—from his 
tutelage under the social scien­
tist Ervin Szabo, to his brief stint 
as a commissar in the Hungarian 
Soviet Republic, to his loyalty to 
the Communist International—
Renaud renders accessible central 
theoretical debates on the Left and 
provides a blueprint for the story 
of neoleftists after Lukács. Like 
young neoleftists to come, Lukács 
obsessed over the authenticity of 
movements once they had solid­
ified into partisan bureaucracies. 
Renaud makes a great choice in 
using Lukács’ life to display the 
heterogeneity of leftist ideology, 
even in an age of mounting Soviet 
paternalism. 

Renaud leaves Lukács behind 
after the initial chapters to con­
front his real subject matter: small 
left-wing organizations through­
out the long twentieth century. 
Renaud finds plenty of room 
to navigate narrative themes of 
newness, intergenerational con­
flict, and radical experimentation 
through the history of the Org, an 
underground syndicate of Marx­
ist intellectuals and working-class 
organizers. The Org’s initial stra­
tegic preoccupation with over­
coming squabbles between Com­
munists and Social Democrats 
highlights the way opposing forces 
within the Left motivated new 
organizational projects. Its even­
tual co-optation by rebellious stu­
dents embodies the intergenera­
tional conflict that drives Renaud’s 
history. Its tactical overhaul from a 
system of conspiratorial cells into 
a decentralized antifascist net­
work demonstrates the kind of 
organizational fluidity through­
out history that interests Renaud. 
Even the Org’s change in mon­
iker to New Beginning operates 
as an endearing thematic callback 
to youth and rejuvenation. The 
fact that such a cogent historical 
argument emerges from materials 
so sparsely translated and arranged 
for an English-speaking audience 
is a testament to Renaud’s skill as 
a historian. 

From the Left Book Club in 
London, to the Italian emigres of 
Justice and Liberty, to the Catalan 
Workers and Peasants’ Bloc, plenty 
of other neoleftist organizations 
and their members also abound 
in the early half of Renaud’s nar­
rative. Their relevance to the plot, 
however, often depends on their 
engagement with the antifascist 
front in Spain and their relation­
ship with New Beginning once in 
exile. Beyond that, they hang like 
loose narrative threads. Renaud 
also limits his engagement with 
the subject of imperialism, which 
appears only as an occasional refer­
ence in later segments of the book 
without much contextualization or 
examination.

When he does manage to spin 
the transnational web together, 
however, Renaud proves remark­
ably effective. His treatment of 
the Spanish front offers a potent 
setting through which to examine 
leftist youth’s estrangement from 
the Stalinist project, once again 
forcing our attention towards 
intergenerational tensions while 
seamlessly integrating Spain into 
a 
historiographical 
perspective 
largely focused on Germany. As we 
look at the interwar years through 
Renaud’s neoleftist lens, the Molo­
tov-Ribbentrop Pact becomes a 
climactic betrayal, the culmination 
of a gradual crescendo of aggres­
sive Soviet policies against left­
ists abroad. New Lefts, through its 
biographical purview, renders bare 
the stakes of discord within the 
ranks of the workers’ movement.

And yet a bittersweetness hangs 
over 
the 
narrative. 
Renaud’s 
emphasis on German “New Lefts” 
lends itself to a depressing transna­
tional narrative of impotence and 
co-optation in exile. Nazism’s rise 
to power inevitably scattered small 
leftist projects to the wind, forc­
ing their members to demonstrate 
remarkable ingenuity in maintain­
ing international and often illegal 
connections. The same precarities 
of refugee status that spurred such 
ingenuity, however, also pressured 
fringe neoleftists to align with 
bourgeois 
democracies 
against 
fascism. Renaud inevitably tracks 
how interwar antifascists aban­
doned aspirations of grassroots 
revolution in Germany and seg­
ued their positions into populist 
Social Democracy. The narrative 
encourages us to appreciate the 
agency with which former radicals 
set aside their aspirations, and yet 
at no point can its author outrun 
the conclusion that, by the turn of 
the sixties, Marxism as a driving 
political doctrine had more or less 
died out.

Nor did the zeitgeist of the six­
ties unambiguously redeem twen­
tieth-century 
leftism. 
nuanced telling of the sixties 
details the exhilarating revival of 
antifascist methods and rhetoric 
by youth retaliating against the 
new technocracy of post-indus­
trial capitalism. But it also captures 
the dissonance between bourgeois 
students of the New Left and the 
workers with whom they politi­
cally aligned themselves. The same 
spontaneity and intentional refusal 
to centralize that characterized 
the sixties’ uprisings also proved 
politically ineffective, despite their 
cultural significance. Renaud goes 
so far as to lean into neoleftism’s 
ephemerality as an ironic com­
ponent of a political process that 
strives to build tomorrow’s utopia 
through today’s practices. Neoleft­
ists tried, failed, and tried again in a 
seemingly endless quest to remain 
forever young, authentic, and true 
to their utopian aspirations.

For Renaud, that irony is the 
point of neoleftist history and the 
driving force behind his narrative. 
But, as a reader, I found myself 
wishing  for his narrative to offer 
of unity, Terence Renaud—a 
lecturer in the Humanities and 
member of Directed Studies 
faculty at Yale—pushes his au­
dience to tune into the discord 
that has always fractured the 
international Left.
