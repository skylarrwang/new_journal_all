undergraduates

knowledge of history.
The theory that unites Snow­
den’s scholarship and pedagogy 
is that epidemics are neither ran­
dom manifestations of biology nor 
punishments from a higher power, 
but equal and opposite reactions to 
the forces of social, economic, and 
political organization in a particu­
lar time and place. Societies create 
their own vulnerabilities to infec­
tious disease, and preventing epi­
demics means recognizing—and 
rectifying—those 
vulnerabilities. 
“Meteorologists can’t tell you how 
strong the winds are going to be, 
and they can’t predict what year 
tion beyond public health institu­
tions and academic journals. That 
was, of course, until two years 
ago—when the sky darkened and 
the wind began to blow.

The seventh cholera pandemic 
was first identified in 1961, in 
Java, Indonesia. The disease spent 
the next decade criss-crossing 
Asia before making its way to the 
Middle East, North Africa, and—
by way of the Mediterranean, in 
1973—Naples, an Italian port city 
so unhygienic that even its resi­
dents thought it a dangerous place 
to live. In September of that year, 
the country,” he concluded. Then 
the outbreak spread to Rome. 
At the time, Frank Snowden 
was a 27 year-old political science 
doctoral student at Oxford, living 
near the Vatican and doing 
research for a dissertation on Ita­
lian fascism. When cholera arrived 
in Rome, Snowden saw its effects 
first hand: stones thrown through 
the windows of cars with Naples 
license plates, produce stands 
overturned, shopkeepers beaten in 
the streets by angry mobs. Social 
upheaval, political strife, vio­
lence—exactly what Snowden had 
come to Italy to study—all engen­
dered by a force he had hardly 
considered before then: disease.

A decade later, Snowden—by 
then, a lecturer in European his­
tory at the University of Lon­
don—was working on a study of 
early twentieth century political 
violence in the South of Italy. But 
while conducting his fieldwork, 
he came across countless referen­
ces to a cholera outbreak in Naples 
and the violent, xenophobic res­
ponses it had provoked. His sour­
ces referenced 1911, but, as far as 
the historical record was concer­
ned, the last major European out­
break (1973 notwithstanding) had 
been in 1892. He went to Naples 
to fill in the gaps.

He began in the city grave­
yard, counting headstones. Then 
he visited the records room of 
Cotunga Hospital—the same hos­
pital in which President Leone 
once warded off evil spirits—and 
found that the 1911 edition of the 
hospital’s annual death registry was 
orders of magnitude thicker than 
the years around it. He combed 
through the research wing’s archi­
ves and uncovered that, in 1911, 
the doctors at Cotugno happened 
to all be studying the same subject: 
cholera. 
it’s coming,” says Snowden, “but 
if you live in the Caribbean, you’d 
be really unwise if you didn’t pre­
pare for a hurricane.”
For decades, Snowden and 
colleagues 
warned 
that 
the 
modern world was critically igno­
rant of the epidemiological storm 
waiting to happen. Their concern, 
however, demanded little atten­
Italian President Giavanni Leone 
visited the city’s Cotugno infec­
tious disease hospital and was pho­
tographed shaking hands with a 
cholera patient while holding the 
corne (rock-and-roll finger horns) 
behind his back, a folklore ges­
ture meant to ward off evil spirits. 
“Naples once again presents the 
mortifying picture of its wounds 
and problems to the attention of 
Snowden's book, Epidemics and Society, published in October 2019, was widely 
recommended by scholars in the field in the first year of the coronavirus pandemic.

“I had the chance to do some­
thing that doesn’t happen very 
often,” Snowden says. “I was able 
to discover an epidemic that had 
no history.” The seed of curio­
sity planted a decade earlier in the 
sticky late summer of 1973 had 
sprouted. Snowden had a story 
on his hands—a forgotten epide­
mic, unanswered questions, and a 
whole lot of science to learn.

“I am committed to the view 
that you can't write the history 
of diseases without understan­
ding how they work,” says Snow­
den. Upon returning to England, 
Snowden spent a sabbatical in the 
Bodleian Library at Oxford, rea­
ding old editions of The Lancet, 
a medical journal. He began with 
the journal’s founding in 1823. 
“It’s something I wouldn’t recom­
mend to anyone,” says Snowden, 
“But it did serve me in good stead.” 
Snowden’s research on Italian 
cholera continued for more than 
a decade, and in 1991 it led him 
back to Yale, where he had been 
an assistant professor in the nine­
teen-seventies. This time, he was 
hired as a scholar with a unique 
dual-command of both scienti­
fic and social history. In 1995, 
he published Naples in the Time 
of Cholera, 1884–1911, the story 
of two outbreaks, why one was 
remembered and the other era­
sed from history, and what they 
revealed about Italian society at 
the tumultuous turn of the cen­
tury.

A decade later, Snowden publi­
shed another book on Italy’s epi­
demic experience, The Conquest 
of 
Malaria: 
Italy, 
1900-1962, 
which covered the country’s six­
ty-year mission to defeat what 
was once its “national disease.” 
The book illustrated the connec­
tions between malaria and twen­
tieth century Italian politics—from 
how antimalarial education helped 
expand trade unions, civil liber­
ties, and women’s rights to the 
German army’s use of malaria as 
a bioweapon in the second world 
war. Conquest was released to cri­
tical acclaim, winning prizes from 
the American Historical Associa­
tion, the American Association for 
the History of Medicine, and the 
Malaria Foundation International.

In 2010, Snowden’s undergra­
duate class “Epidemics in Western 
Society Since 1600” was immorta­
lized on YouTube as a Yale Open 
Course. In the decade since its 
posting, the course has accumu­
lated nearly one hundred forty 
thousand views—half of which 
have been within the last two 
years.

“I would argue that emerging 
diseases are an inherent part of the 
human condition,” Snowden says 
to conclude the course’s final lec­
ture. “And if I were to make just 
one prediction, I would expect 
that there would be more, and 
that the systems set in place and 
improved by SARS, avian flu, and

poor, the damned, the ragged men

pped the disease and spread it. In 
the nineteen-eighties, HIV/AIDS 
exposed both Western society’s 
vicious contempt for gay men, 
and its blatant indifference to life 
on the African continent.

again in Rome, working on a 
long-awaited book about the Cold 
War, when the coronavirus first

isolation in their apartment.

ted the fundamental vulnerability 
of an interconnected world; the 
false comfort of national borders; 
the “hubris,” as Snowden describes 
it, of a world that both recognized 
the threat of epidemic disease and 
operated as if epidemics—at least, 
the epoch-defining kind—were 
simply behind it.

“I’ve often quipped that there 
are two kinds of doctors: medi­
cal doctors, the useful kind; and 
PhD’s, the useless kind,” Snowden 
says with a grin. “You don’t want 
to wake up in a gurney and see 
Frank standing there.” 
And yet, with the world in a 
swine flu will be tested again in 
our new century.”

Q: What is a disease? A: Who’s 
asking?
“Disease,” 
medical 
historian 
Charles Rosenberg writes in his 
1992 book Explaining Epidemics, 
“is at once a biological event, a 
generation-specific repertoire of 
verbal constructs reflecting medi­
cine's intellectual and institutio­
nal history, an occasion for and 
potential legitimation of public 
policy, an aspect of social role and 
individual—intrapsychic—iden­
tity, a sanction for cultural values, 
and a structuring element in doc­
tor-patient interactions.” 
To study epidemics through 
the historian’s microscope is to 
integrate all of those definitions 
and the murky forces of causality 
between them, to examine how 
the cultural attitudes, political ins­
titutions, and biological mecha­
nisms all shape the course of his­
tory.

The bubonic plague, Snowden 
writes in Epidemics and Society, 
exploited the urban squalor of 
medieval Europe, upset its cultu­
ral and religious conceptions of 
death, and permanently reshaped 
its political, economic, and demo­
graphic makeup. In the late eigh­
teenth century, yellow fever drove 
the French army out of Haiti, and, 
in the early nineteenth, dysentery 
and typhus drove Napoleon and 
the French out of Russia. In the 
latter half of the nineteenth cen­
tury, tuberculosis, in its glacial 
destruction of the body, came to 
signify beauty, pedigree, the lavish 
tragedy of a life too well-lived. 
Half-a-century later, the disease—
reimagined through the innova­
tion of “germ theory”—was trans­
formed into a condition of the
