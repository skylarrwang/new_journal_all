EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
After the panel, I reached out 
to Tracie to learn about her life 
in solitary confinement. Her story 
was also reported this February in 
The Politic.Tracie lived in horrific 
conditions for 23 years at York 
Correctional Institution (a prison 
in East Lyme, Connecticut’s only 
state prison for women), start­
ing in 1992. She spent seven of 
those years in solitary confine­
ment. Those seven years taught 
her things she never imagined she 
would ever have to learn, like how 
to take a shower in handcuffs and 
how to talk with other inmates 
through toilets and ventilation 
ducts. Tracie now has severe 
PTSD: she is still bothered by 
lights, she can’t stand the sound of 
a television, even at low volume, 
and she’s got anxiety attacks from 
certain noises, like jingling keys.
Initially, Tracie was sentenced 
to solitary confinement for two 
years. Yet each subsequent time 
that she was issued a disciplinary 
ticket, the time she had already 
spent in solitary confinement was 
discounted, and she had to start all 
over again. Once she got a ticket 
for giving a tea-bag to another 
girl because they weren’t allowed 
to share personal items, or “com­
missary.” Another time she slid 
a plastic garbage bag to another 
inmate without first asking the 
guard if she could. Two years 
became seven years, and her body, 
now in constant aches and pains, 
recalls the damage of that time. 
After sleeping on a metal bed 
for years, Tracie told me her hips 
are 
bad—her 
back, her shoul­
der, everything 
aches. 
Some­
times, in soli­
tary, she wasn’t 
given 
enough 
to 
eat. 
She 
recalled hearing 
guards 
making 
cruel announce­
ments, 
saying 
“Oh, I spit in 
someone's 
tray 
today, I won­
der whose that 
is.” In moments 
like those, she 
preferred to stay 
hungry. 
Her 
body was also a 
means of humil­
iation. 
Doc­
tors announced 
whatever medi­
cal problems she 
had in public, 
she told me. Once, a guard asked 
a larger, mentally ill girl to dance 
and make a fool out of herself. 
Sometimes, Tracie told me, guards 
strip searched them just to laugh 
at their bodies. “All of these made 
me worse,” Tracie said. Since 
there was no independent over­
sight that accepted inmates' com­
plaints, Tracie and other incarcer­
ated women suffered all of these in 
silence.


It was hard to get a sense of 
what was going on in the outside 
world while in solitary confine­
ment. All the windows were tinted 
with a painted black film, and it 
took Tracie a long time to finally 
scratch a little of it off. Once in a 
while she could make out squirrels 
climbing up a tree or people's feet 
as they were walking by. Human 
contact was nearly impossible. 
For a period of time, she was only 
allowed visits from her lawyer. On 
the rare occasion that her family 
visited, she had to meet them in 
handcuffs. 

The humiliation and the lone­
liness severely damaged Tracie’s 
mental health, but asking for help 
often made it worse. Tracie told 
me that people in solitary con­
finement are often penalized for 
“overusing” mental health coun­
seling, and she was no exception. 
When Tracie told the correctional 
officers that she was suicidal and 
needed help, she was put into the 
special room in “J tier,” designed 
for people who wanted mental 
help. According to Tracie, the 
two J rooms were the dirtiest 
rooms. They had a connected pipe 
system, so when one toilet flushed, 
the contents passed to the toilet in 
the other room. Tracie found her­
self crying more in the J rooms 
than before. She said that this is 
what the system had been built to 
do—to punish people for asking 
for help, and to let them languish 
without it. In the fifth year of sol­
itary confinement, she came close 
to death, once attempting to hang 
herself. 

Tracie said at the January 22 
panel that she hadn’t  known there 
was a group of people on the out­
side fighting for her while she was 
in solitary confinement. Now, she 
is fighting from the outside her­self. Tracie never had access to 
education programs throughout 
her time in solitary confinement. 
After her release in 2015, she 
started taking classes at Quinnip­
iac, Trinity, and Wesleyan. She’s 
now a recovery support specialist, 
a volunteer leader of ACLU Smart 
Justice, and a frequent speaker at 
SSCT events. Fighting for crimi­
nal justice, such as advocating for 
abolishing solitary confinement, is 
a way for Tracie to make sense of 
23 years in prison. Now 42 years 
old, Tracie can’t help but wonder, 
“What do people see when they 
look at me—what do they see?” 


**You See Lost Souls**
**Page number(s): 39**

Looking at Ray Boyd’s gray and 
white beard, I could see the time 
that had passed him by. We met at 
the Starbucks near Yale’s campus 
for an interview; he is a man of few 
words with a quiet, low voice, but 
he put everything he had to say 
in his autobiography, The Model 
Inmate. Ray takes lots of pride in 
his book and always carries it with 
him. When I asked him if I could 
get a copy somewhere, he imme­
diately took one out of his bag and 
offered it to me as a gift with his 
signature on the title page.

Ray started his incarceration 
at Cheshire Correctional Institu­
tion, about half an hour north of 
New Haven, in December, 1992. 
In Cheshire, though not officially 
acknowledged, everyone is in soli­
tary confinement: Ray told me that 
the only difference between “reg­
ular confinement” and “solitary 
confinement” at Cheshire is that 
the former has two hours outside 
cell time instead of one hour. He 
wrote: “As my cell door slid open I 
stepped out unsure of where I was 
heading; however, I had quickly 
realized when I came to prison the 
one thing that I would find myself 
getting used to was following the 
crowd in whatever direction they 
were flowing in.”

The flow, he told me, sends 
people into a deep abyss. As Ray 
recorded in his writing, many 
people were using church service 
as an excuse to find more out-of-
cell time. “It was as if every crook, 
robber, rapist, thief, murderer and 
gangbanger [had] found their god 
on the inside,” Ray wrote. “The 
place looked more like hell if 
you’d ask me.”

Some choose to escape reality 
through medicine. “You got the 
individual who just could no lon­
ger take the hand that he was dealt 
and could no longer take prison; 
so, to cope with it he runs to the 
medication line each day and 
night to self-medicate to avoid the 
daily reality of being in prison,” he 
wrote.

Ray came back home in Novem­
ber of last year. Like myself and 
other young people around the 
country, he is working to get his 
driver license. A few days after 
our interview, Ray texted me that 
he unfortunately failed his DMV 
learner permit test, but he wished 
me good luck.

Formerly incarcer­
ated people have to 
learn to live normal 
lives again after they 
leave 
prison, 
espe­
cially those who were 
in solitary confine­
ment. For many, this 
proves to be a difficult 
task. Michael Braham, 
who I also met at the SSCT rally 
on Dec 10 and who was also fea­
tured in a February 2022 article in 
The Politic, wasn’t allowed to have 
any visitors, including family and 
friends, or to keep any commissary 
other than religious texts during 
his time in solitary confinement. 
In December, after being released 
for 6 months, Michael was asked 
about how he was adjusting to life 
after prison at the SSCT panel. He 
said, “Adjustment? I don’t know 
how I am adjusting. I hardly sleep, 
I sleep three hours per night.” 

During 
his 
incarceration, 
Michael received his Associate’s 
degree, two Bachelor’s degrees 
and his certification as a paralegal, 
and he is now working with his 
former attorney Alexander Taubes 
LAW 15’. In January, Ray and 
Michael came back again to sup­
port SSCT. Ray said “I just wanna 
come home and advocate for it, 
you know, for what is right.” 
Michael echoed that sentiment: “I 
saw Barbara was fighting for us, so 
I decided to join the fight.” 


**"I Was Diagnosed 
with PTSD"**

The 
problems 
that 
solitary 
confinement creates—the use of 
overwhelming force and physical 
restraints, the humiliation at the 
hands of guards, the lack of proper 
mental health and counseling, the 
hostile and toxic prison culture—
are felt by everyone involved. 

Kevnesha Boyd is a former ther­
apist at New Haven Correctional 
Center. Kevnesha was Robby’s 
therapist. Witnessing her own 
parents’ incarceration and the 
impact the War on Drugs had on 
the Black community, Kevnesha 
pursued a career in criminal justice 
and landed her dream job at the 
DoC, a place where she believed 
she would be able to provide peo­
ple with much-needed help.

Kevnesha started working at 
NHCC in 2015, and her dream

Kevnesha’s anxiety worsened, and 
she started to become paranoid about 
losing her medical license because 
she knew she was delivering a low level 
of care. As a mental health counselor 
herself, she started going to therapy.
