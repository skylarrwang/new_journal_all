THE  NEW  JOURNAL
Late one night, we walked across the uneven floors 
of the building at 320 Temple Street, past hissing radi­
ators and up a creaky, carpeted staircase. My friends 
and I were desperate to find a last-minute music prac­
tice space. The rooms­—harshly lit, with paint peeling 
from the walls and carpet fraying at the edges—con­
tained shiny Steinways and sleek black music stands. 
As we filled the long, exhausted halls with the music 
of composers living and dead, I found myself thinking 
about the tattered building’s past—possibly glorious, 
possibly unremarkable, before time wore it down.
The house that sits at 320 Temple Street, between 
Silliman College and the Slifka Center, may have a 
baby blue exterior, but it’s far from its infancy. The 
building has stood here for two hundred years, always 
in use, with an identity spanning everything from 
private residence to alumni meetinghouse. Yale has 
owned the building for a century. But since March 
2020, it has stood there unoccupied, its facade eroding 
and its future uncertain.
“There was bright blue paint coming off the walls, 
a really decrepit staircase and shitty carpet in the Blue 
House,” said Charles Comiter, who graduated from 
Yale College in 2020 and worked as a monitor in the 
building in the 2019-20 academic year, the most recent 
year Yale School of Music actively used the building. 
Comiter said he thought of the building as a house 
steeped in 1800s wealth that, over the years, has aged 
into an “old and decrepit random building” known to 
fewer and fewer people. After all, most of the emails I 
sent—to dozens of students, staff, and other members 
of the Yale community—were met with variations of  
“We have no recollection of using this building” or “I 
wish I had information, but I don’t.”
Cellist Francis Fedora ’24 described the building 
similarly: “It's a little spooky, especially late at night…
and also the creaks.” He imagined that the building 
may have had a past as an orphanage, and he spoke 
with fondness of late-night practice sessions in the 
building. His slow intonation work, focused perfor­
mance practice, and messy sight-reading all felt delir­
ious to him, surreal memories that revitalized hollow 
rooms with the sounds of midnight music and laugh­
ter.
Comiter and Fedora both imagined the building’s 
pasts in ways that were only partially correct but 
wholly constructed from memories and archetypes. 
The tale of a storied building can never be much more 
than interweaving lines of blurred memory, faded 
photographs, and yellowed documents.
According to one such document, a listing in the 
New Haven Preservation Trust, the building was 
built in 1806 and became a patchwork quilt of Fed­
eral style and French Empire architectures. A com­
bination of Yale Library archives, old issues of the 
Yale Alumni Magazine, and books published by the 
University Press reveal additional information: The 
building’s first known resident was Rev. Jedidiah 
Morse, an American Congregational minister often 
known as the father of geography and the father of 
Samuel Morse, of Morse Code and Morse College 
fame, who lived there as a child. The building under­
went its first renovation in the eighteen-sixties, then

cycled through three owners and one more remod­
eling until Yale University purchased it in the early 
nineteen-twenties. In the decades that followed, it 
served as a dorm for Yale freshmen, then for women 
graduate students. It was the Yale Alumni House from 
1958-1975, and subsequently housed the Department 
of Religious Studies until 2001, at which point its 
ownership shifted to the School of Music. For the past 
twenty years, the building has been a liminal space for 
the music school community, functioning as an extra 
practice, instruction, and social space when other 
buildings were being renovated or under construc­
tion.
Another tattered document, a floor plan from the 
mid-20th century stored in Yale’s Manuscripts and 
Archives, shows that a first-floor room facing Tem­
ple Street was once Rev. Morse’s kitchen, but became 
one of the few rooms at the School of Music with 
more than one grand piano, for students to practice 
duets and concerti. Bedrooms turned into practice 
rooms—spaces that, according to Comiter, were often 
frequented by graduate students during the day and 
undergraduates at night. The old porcelain bathtubs 
were covered with wooden planks and locked shut. 
Somehow, through the decades of ringing and bang­
ing—from clashing cymbals, clinking piano keys, and 
whooshing clarinets—the house retained its shape as 
a house.
Now, according to J. Lloyd Suttle, Yale’s vice pro­
vost for academic resources, the Provost’s Office is in 
discussions with Robert Blocker, Dean of the Yale 
School of Music, about the future of 320 Temple.
According to Stefanie Parkyn, the Chief of Staff of 
the School of Music, the music school has “vacated 
the building” as of this year and is not actively using 
it. But Suttle said that “no decisions have been made 
about the future use of 320 Temple,” if and when the 
building is officially unassigned from the School of 
Music. Yale could essentially do anything it wants to 
the building in terms of physical modifications, said 
Alex Eginton, director of the New Haven Preserva­
tion Trust.
Fedora spoke about the long hallway on the build­
ing’s first floor, a hallway that extends past what 
was once, according to University floor plans from 
the nineteen-seventies, a “RESIDENCE SUITE” 
and “BED ROOM” for the house’s “MANAGE­
MENT COUPLE,” a staircase, two bedrooms, and 
three porches. In its seeming endlessness the hallway 
is evocative of the building’s long past and obscure 
future.
“I never went down the bottom hallway,” Fedora 
said. “It scared me for some reason. It was just so … 
long.”
I’ve never ventured all the way down, either, and I 
don’t know if I’ll ever get that chance. For now, the 
building will continue to occupy the same plot of land 
it has claimed for two centuries. Its floorboards will 
keep creaking, the paint on its walls will keep peeling, 
flake by flake, and its pianos will remain in purgatory.
