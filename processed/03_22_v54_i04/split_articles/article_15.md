EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Before my rescheduled jumble of omicron-in­
duced flights home, my last night in New Haven 
involved a midnight GHeav BLT, an emerald 
green puffer, and a fifteen minute trip to the 
YUAG. Well, more like a fifteen minute farewell 
shuffle that doubled as a 1.5 speed docent tour for 
my friends, who mistakenly trusted me to check 
the museum’s closing time (it’s earlier on Satur­
days). I am certain my experience is not a unique 
one. If you find yourself in this position when the 
YUAG reopens, relish the pre-closing quiet. Pay 
your respects to the wooden Urhobo maternity 
figure on the ground floor, the one that toddlers 
love to hug. Glide through the Greco-Roman 
atrium and take the elevator to the fourth story. 
Stop by Marie Watts’ pink and blue patchwork 
on the prey and predators of land. Remind 
yourself that it’s February by heading out to the 
sculpture terrace. Eight minutes before closing, 
security will inform you that the stairs are to your 
left. Amidst the chirps of a walkie-talkie-like 
communication system, you will realize you have 
overstayed your welcome. Much to Ben Stiller’s 
chagrin, the security team will make sure you do 
not spend the night at the YUAG. 

We landed safely. I reminded myself that I’m older 
now. That fear felt childlike. Sleepless passengers 
trudged past the relic construction machines shut 
down for the storm. The orange light glowed on the 
excavator’s teeth, and my dad wondered what they’re 
building. We passed through the three-gate airport—
my mom waited for us on the other side—she flew 
out before us to see her parents. It was then two in 
the morning, and she ran to me before I could see her 
through the condensed exhaust clouds from the car. 
The gas burned in my nose.

She left the doors open, as she always does, and 
music swelled from the dashboard speakers. Her arms 
spread around me. I remembered I hadn’t been good 
about answering her calls. It was the end of my first 
semester in college, the longest I’d ever been away. 
I see her image now, still, singing and jumping—
she looks at me and belts Neil Diamond’s “Girl, You’ll 
Be a Woman Soon.” Her voice buzzes contralto. The 
car feels warm inside. The song plays. It ends: 
“Girl, you'll be a woman soon
Please, come take my hand.”
