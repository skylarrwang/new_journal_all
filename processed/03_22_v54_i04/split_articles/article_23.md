EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
After dark it is easier to see
Burning
Cities with ice
Dancing just out of reach.
Everyone is an element, afraid to
Fuse, compound or
Group together, instead we are inert
Helium, only wanting to float up
Into air.
Jealousy is rust and it
Kisses sweet oxygen which 
Lingers because it is
More than
Noble.
Opening eyes is as hard as
Plasma solidifying into
Quilts of passionate stillness, and while
Rubber bands pull and snap,
Staying put is harder. Electrons
Taste like lemon, smile like
Under-eye bags, sound like
Vacuums scraping up shards of
White painted porcelain.
Xenon is noble, we all want to be noble, but 
You are different, you melt and mold and 
Zero me down to nothing.


**Title: Downtown Crossing Project**
**Author: Not specified**

Through phase one and phase 
two of the Downtown Crossing 
Project, the city has been able to 
make more taxable property avail­
able for development while slowly 
beginning the process of highway 
removal. Soon, Orange Street 
and South Orange Street will be 
connected by a pedestrian and 
low-speed vehicle friendly inter­
section. Once the federal govern­
ment agrees to fund phases three 
and four, Temple Street and Con­
gress Avenue will be fully con­
nected. 

“It is the goal to provide eco­
nomic 
development 
opportu­
nities for people that live in the 
surrounding 
neighborhoods, 
including the Hill,” Donna Hall, 
the senior project manager of 
the Downtown Crossing Project, 
told me. The idea is that the new 
accessibility of the area will allow 
residents to be more mobile and 
connected to the rest of the city. 
It hasn’t been easy. “It took years 
of negotiation and study with the 
Federal 
Highway 
Administra­
tion,” she said, to ensure the city 
could build the intersection and 
still accommodate traffic. 

The website for the project 
reserves space to discuss the Oak 
Street community and the city’s 
role in its demolition. Under the 
“history” tab, there is a description 
of the diverse families who lived 
on Oak Street, and an acknowl­

edgement that the city priori­
tized automobility over commu­
nity cohesion. The maker of the 
website has included a photo that 
emphasizes Oak Street’s “before” 
and “after”—but the destruction 
isn’t a source of pride like it is in 
Richard Lee’s short film. 

The Downtown Crossing Proj­
ect is an attempt to rectify some 
of the harm inflicted by urban 
renewal. But for the hundreds of 
families expelled from Oak Street, 
and for the countless other work­-
ing-class residents of New Haven 
whose lives and livelihoods were 
upended by urban renewal, it’s an 
attempt that comes sixty years too 
late.
