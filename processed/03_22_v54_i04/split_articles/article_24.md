A Scarlet Letter 
Thomas Burke has lost his faith. 
Not in God—Burke is now a pas­
tor in the Norfield Congregational 
Church in Weston, Connecticut—
but in his country, and the insti­
tution through which he served 
it: the U.S. Marine Corps. Their 
motto reads: “Semper Fidelis,” or 
“Always Faithful.” But when the 
Marines failed him, releasing him 
with a bad case of Post-Traumatic 
Stress Disorder (PTSD) and a bad 
paper discharge, his faith in the 
Marines failed in return.
Burke, who looks like the dop­
pelganger of Ted Lasso from the 
eponymous TV show, enlisted in 
the First Battalion Third Marines 
out of Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii right 
after graduating from high school 
in 2007. He served for three years, 
first in Iraq and then in Afghan­
istan, where he learned the local 
language of Pashto and developed 
close relationships with the boys 
who lived near the base. The boys 
would help Burke and his pla­
toon, letting them know where 
bombs were hidden and bringing 
them any they located. One day, 
a group of kids was walking over 
to visit Burke at basecamp to hand 
over a rocket-propelled grenade 
they had found, when he heard a 
blast. The grenade had exploded. 
Burke watched eight of the kids 
he had befriended die. 
“They died right in front of 
me,” Burke says. “I started smok­
ing a lot of hash to kind of deal 
with that. And the military, the 
Marine Corps, didn't really like 
that too much.” Right before 
his seven-month deployment in 
Afghanistan ended, and he was 
due to return to his station in 
Hawaii, Burke was drug tested. 
It came back positive for mari­
juana. The military, in theory, 
has a zero-tolerance policy on 
drugs. Enforcement, though, is 
at the discretion of a platoon’s 
commander.  “There's this view 
of zero tolerance for drugs in the 
military,” Daniel Conway, a mil­
itary defense lawyer says. “But 
the application trickles down 
from leadership.” Burke’s unit 
commander responded by giving 
Burke an Other-than-Honorable 
discharge, or what is known in the 
military as bad paper. 
“There are three administrative 
separations a servicemember can 
receive,” a Department of Defense 
Instruction source tells me. They 
are: Honorable, the most common 
and highest designation; Gen­
eral-under-Honorable-Condi­
tions for minor misconduct; and 
Other-than-Honorable, which is 
given in lieu of a court martial, 
and amounts, essentially, to expel­
ling a soldier from duty. “Those 
are discharges that would defi­
nitely put a bit of a scarlet letter 
on you. You don’t get them if you 
didn’t, in the eyes of the military 
at least, misbehave in some way. 
Or [do] something that the mili­
tary condemns,” Brad Carson, the 
former United States Under Sec­
retary of the Army under Barack 
Obama tells me. These behaviors 
are still often relatively minor 
offenses, such as failing a drug test 
or exhibiting a pattern of miscon­
duct, like being late to work three 
times. “They’re definitely stigma­
tizing,” Carson continues. And 
the implications are damning.
Burke’s Other-than-Honorable 
discharge meant he was deprived 
of receiving any benefits he could 
have been awarded for his service. 
This includes healthcare from the 
Veterans Association (VA) and 
post-secondary education from 
the G.I. Bill. Other-than-Hon­
orably discharged veterans are 
often the ones who need mental 
health treatment the most. In a 
Boston Medical Center Psychiatry 
study of U.S. Marines deployed to 
Iraq and Afghanistan, research­
ers found that those with a PTSD 
diagnosis were eleven times more 
likely to have a misconduct dis­
charge than those without. Deci­
sions, for those who rank below 
officer, about whether misconduct 
is worthy of a less-than-Honor­
able discharge or not, and who 
gets blacklisted from VA benefits 
as a result, are made by the ranks 
of commanders, with no tribunal 
or oversight by higher-ups, docu­
ments of published military guide­
lines as well as conversations with 
sources reveal. 
“There was no judge. There 
was no jury. It was just some guy 
who’s a middle-aged dude who 
just didn’t like me, and made a 
decision to fuck me over for the 
rest of my life,” Burke says.
Despite his PTSD and his lack 
of access to resources to treat 
it, Burke has built a new life for 
himself in the twelve years since 
his discharge. He graduated from 
Yale Divinity School. He became a 
pastor. But his discharge status still 
scars him. “An Other-than-Hon­
orable discharge makes it seem 
like I'm this other-than-honorable 
person, especially in a culture that 
really celebrates heroic service in 
the military so much. This not 
just erases my service, but it is a 
negative and a pejorative on who 
I am,” Burke explains. While he 
acknowledges it’s possible to seek 
counseling for PTSD, he adds, 
“You can't work through an Oth­
er-than-Honorable discharge in 
therapy. Because no matter how 
far I get, no matter what healing I 
do, I always have this stupid piece
