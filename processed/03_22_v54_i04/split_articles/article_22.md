THE  NEW  JOURNAL
and people. “I stress that to say we 
were all growing up together,” he 
said, “kids with all these different 
families.”

Sam Teitelman, who died in 
2021, described the community in 
his own tape. “Everybody seemed 
to know everybody else,” he said. 
He and his family were Russian 
immigrants, and they were all 
quickly accepted into one of the 
many synagogue communities in 
the area. “You’d have meat mar­
kets, and grocery stores, and a 
shoe store, and a clothing store, 
and there was a very large grocery 
operation, fruits and vegetables 
and groceries.” 

“Now, of course, it's just that 
gulf of access space for modern 
transportation,” Samuel Slie said. 
Urban renewal, he said, became 
urban removal. The city became 
more segregated, public housing 
was torn down, and the people 
who fought against it were usually 
unsuccessful. “They took the heart 
of the middle class out of the city.”
Francesca 
Ammon 
dedicates 
a chapter of her book Bulldozer: 
Demolition and Clearance of the 
Postwar Landscape—the first schol­
arly account of the history of the 
bulldozer—to the history of urban 
renewal in New Haven. She writes 
that New Haven received more 
urban renewal grants per capita 
than any other city in the country, 
and in the nineteen-sixties, the 
city destroyed one out of every six 
dwelling units. 

Richard Lee, the former mayor, 
spearheaded urban renewal in 
New Haven. He embraced the 
opportunity to be at the fore­
front of progress, and happily took 
part in photoshoots in which he 
would sit in the operator’s cab of 
a wrecking crane, surrounded by 
demolition. 

This process of urban renewal, 
even outside of New Haven, 
implies an inherent contradic­
tion. Progress and renewal require 
demolition. When the city builds 
a highway, it razes neighborhoods 
to the ground. Prosperity in the 
form of modernization is made 
possible by rubble and bulldozers, 
or a wrecking ball tearing through 
the wall of an old tenement build­
ing. In the Oak Street commu­
nity, those homes were filled with 
working class Jewish, Italian, and 
Black families, who suddenly had 
to find a new place to live—a place 
that never quite felt like home. It’s 
difficult to believe what happened 
here to be progressive when an 
entire community was erased. 

John DeStefano, Jr., who was 
mayor of New Haven from 1994 
until 2016, mentioned in our 
interview that Richard Lee had 
been a friend of his. I asked how 
Lee later felt about the decisions 
he made regarding urban renewal 
in New Haven, after seeing its 
effects. 

DeStefano 
paraphrased 
something he’d heard Lee say 
much later in his life: “‘Our ambi­
tions were glorious, and our fail­
ures were spectacular.’” DeStefano 
thinks Lee had good intentions, 
even though DeStefano’s own 
grandmother’s house was demol­
ished in the process. 

“There was this moment in 
America,” he said, “where cities 
and rebuilding cities were central 
to the national political dialogue, 
which it is not now.”

In 2013, phase one of the 
Downtown 
Crossing 
Project 
(DCP) began. The project orig­
inated during DeStefano’s may­
oral administration in the early 
two-thousands. By this point, 
urban renewal was widely seen by 
both residents and city officials as 
a mistake. 

“[The Connector] created this 
linear wall that people didn't 
walk across,” DeStefano told me, 
when I asked why he found the 
DCP necessary. The construction 
of the Connector created what 
is effectively a dead end, he said, 
where people don’t feel comfort­
able walking. “Commerce didn't 
thrive.”
