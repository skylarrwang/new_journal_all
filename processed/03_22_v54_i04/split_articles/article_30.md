EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Colleen Lord rushed back 
to the kitchen to tend to 
the roast beef in the oven, 
leaving me for a few minutes to 
nervously 
explore 
her home. Her West 
Haven condo sat on 
the Long Island Sound 
with a window facing 
the water. The space 
was decorated with 
light blue and pur­
ple 
wallpaper, 
and 
a reproduction of a 
Monet painting hung 
on the wall. Photos of 
Colleen and her kids, 
smiling and rejoicing 
in each other’s com­
pany, stood on a ledge 
above 
the 
electric 
stove. 
To the left of these 
photos 
was 
a 
lit­
tle memorial plaque 
made of black stone. 
“Carl Robert Talbot. 
May 30, 1988-March 
21, 2019,” it read. 
When I arrived ear­
lier that day, Colleen 
introduced me to her 
dog, Ruby, a three 
year old “Cavachi,” a 
Cavalier King Charles 
Spaniel-Chihuahua 
mix. Ruby has kept 
Colleen 
company 
since the onset of the COVID-19 
pandemic. By then it had already 
been a year since she had lost her 
son, Carl Robert “Robby” Tal­
bot. The loneliness had become 
unbearable. So Colleen decided to 
adopt a dog in his memory.
“In Hebrew, Ruby means first 
son.” Colleen tossed a treat to her 
dog. “And Robby was my first 
son.”


Hospitals and pris­
ons were a revolv­
ing door in Robby’s 
thirty years of life. 
Robby 
struggled 
with 
schizophrenia 
and bipolar disorder. 
He had been in and 
out 
of 
Yale-New 
Haven 
Hospital 
many times and was 
often 
arrested 
for 
possession of mari­
juana or trespassing. 
After his last arrest 
for violating parole, 
he was brought back 
to prison at about 
10 PM on March 
19, 2019. Two days 
later, at 9:40 AM, 
he was pronounced 
dead. 
When the phone 
rang and the news 
came 
Robby’s 
death, Colleen told 
me that she asked the 
correctional 
officer 
at the other end of 
the line, “What hap­
pened to my son?” It 
took Colleen seven 
months to get the medical exam­
ination report, another year for her 
to access the material used during 
the State Attorney’s investigation, 
and several months more to make 
sense of scattered evidence from 
footage, medical reports, and cor­
rectional officers’ testimonies. 
Now, we were sitting in front 
of the 19 minutes of camera foot­
age, provided to her by the state 
attorney around a year and a half 
ago, that depicted the four sprays 
of mace and the kick Robby suf­
fered in his last moments of life. 
Colleen pressed play.


If I wasn’t choked with shock 
and anger, I would have cried 
watching Robby’s life fade in 
front of my eyes. I told Colleen 
that I could watch it alone, in case 
she felt it would be traumatizing 
to rewatch the video. But Colleen 
stayed. As the video played, she hit 
pause at several moments to calmly 
explain what was going on; were 
it not for the subtle tremble in her 
voice, it might have seemed like 
we were just analyzing a movie. 
“Many times,” Colleen replied 
when I asked how many times 
she’d watched the footage. “Some­
times I would be like ‘Oh, what 
did he say?’ and go back and redo 
it and write everything down in 
the timeline and identify all of the 
officers in there and compare what 
statements they said.” She forced a 
smile. “I still cry every day.” 
Based on the video, a pub­
licly available report by the state 
attorney, and Colleen’s memory, 
the events leading up to Robby’s 
death are fairly clear.


On Tuesday, March 19, 2019, 
Robby took what would be his last 
dose of methadone in the morn­
ing. In the evening, Robby was 
remanded to custody in the New 
Haven Correctional Center for 
staying in a hotel with his father, 
which violated his parole. That 
night, in prison, Robby had a psy­
chotic episode. 
The next day, Robby’s with­
drawal was worsening, and he 
was sent to the medical unit for 
psychological evaluation. Robby 
started yelling, screaming, smear­
ing feces over himself and the cell.


The day after that, Robby was 
taken to shower and clean off. He 
had difficulty leaving the shower. 
Lt. Carlos Padro stood by the 
door, ordering Robby to stand 
up. He soon lost patience and 
stepped into the tiny bathroom. 
He pepper-sprayed Robby twice 
and kicked him once in the torso. 
Robby screamed and pleaded, 
I can’t breathe! … I can’t see! 
Help me!


A person who is pepper 
sprayed needs to rinse the 
affected area for 15 minutes, 
according to CDC guidelines. 
Robby’s eyes were rinsed for 
only 10 seconds.


Robby was sent back to 
solitary confinement instead of to 
a medical unit to rinse the chem­
icals off his skin. He fell out of his 
wheelchair in the elevator. The 
surrounding police officers told 
him to stand up, and Robby tried. 
But, as a 400 pound man in a nar­
row space, he couldn’t. 
The officers were growing 
impatient. Robby repeated “I’m 
sorry,” then “my skin is on fire,” and 
“help!” Lt. Padro pepper-sprayed 
him again.


In Robby’s solitary confine­
ment cell, the officers chained him 
to his bed. He writhed in pain—
every inch of his skin burned. Lt. 
Padro was still repeating the word 
“Stop.” He sprayed Robby again. 
Robby screamed for it to stop. 
Other officers went in and out 
of the cell. They couldn’t stand the 
chemical agent in the air. Correc­
tional Officer Charles Washing­
ton, whose first name was not 
disclosed in the report and who 
had been standing outside the cell, 
entered and lunged for Robby to 
hold him down by his chest. 
Robby gulped, and once again 
managed to grit out the words, 
can’t… breathe. He never said 
anything else. He lay motionless 
in bed while officers continued 
attaching him to chains.


“Good job to everybody.” Lt. 
Padro said when the officers finally 
left the room. Robby was left 
alone in his unventilated, contam­
inated cell for around 90 minutes. 
At approximately 8:57 AM, Lt. 
Champion determined that Robby 
was not breathing, and he was sent 
to Yale New Haven Hospital.


At 9:40 AM, Robby was pro­
nounced dead.


Colleen eventually decided not 
to release the video. “I just keep 
thinking about what the state 
attorney said to me—not to make 
it public because there are ‘cruel 
people who have sick websites 
exploiting videos like this,” Col­
leen said. “I am cognizant that 
change comes [more] swift[ly] 
when people actually see what 
happened on video.” 
The New Haven Independent not 
only covered Robby’s death but 
also paid tribute to him and his life 
Despite the publicity surrounding 
death, 
however, 
nine 
months after that terrible morning 
still 
desperately 
trying to find out what exactly had 
happened to her son.


**Title: Stop Solitary CT**
**Page number(s): 35-36**

Despite the publicity surround­
ing Robby’s death, however, nine 
Colleen was still desperately try­
ing to find out what exactly had 
happened to her son. In December 
2019, she still hadn’t received any 
state police documents and videos. 
Around that time, she read an arti­
cle about a group named Stop Sol­
itary CT (SSCT), in which Karen 
Martucci, a spokesperson for the 
Department of Corrections, was 
quoted defending the practice of 
solitary confinement, saying that 
isolation “is reserved for the most 
violent, unmanageable” offenders, 
such as one who recently “embed­
ded a fan blade in another inmate’s 
skull.” Colleen knew from Rob­
by’s case that Martucci had mis­
characterized the policy. 


It was then, she told me, that 
she started to believe that the 
Connecticut DOC was running 
a legalized system of “torture,” a 
system with far-ranging reper­
cussions beyond the death of her 
son. So when an SSCT member 
reached out to Colleen in Decem­
ber, 2019, she met him in a coffee 
shop in New Haven to learn how 
she could get involved. 

SSCT was founded in 2017 by 
Barbara Fair, a lifelong activist in 
New Haven fighting for crimi­
nal justice, whose work has been 
covered in the CT Mirror, the New 
Haven Independent, and The Pol­
itic. Barbara Fair had witnessed 
firsthand how her youngest son’s 
mental health rapidly deteriorated 
during his solitary confinement at 
Northern Correctional Institution, 
where he was kept during pre-trial 
at the age of 16. She decided to 
make it her life’s work to end the 
pain  solitary confinement inflicts. 
Over the years, SSCT has brought 
together people like Colleen, for­
mer Department of Corrections 
(DoC) officers, formerly incar­
cerated people, and legal experts. 
Together, they have been fighting 
to end solitary confinement state­
wide and replace iso­
lation with a humane, 
safe, and rehabilita­
tive system, such as 
providing 
education 
opportunities 
reentry programs to 
incarcerated people. 
In 2019, Yale Law 
Professor Hope Met­
calf, who has worked closely with 
SSCT, argued in a letter to the 
UN that Connecticut's practices 
of isolation and in-cell chaining 
qualify as torture. In 2020, the 
UN stated that prolonged solitary 
confinement (without meaningful 
human contact for 22 hours for 
more than 15 consecutive days) 
amounts to psychological torture. 
In February 2021, SSCT called 
on the Connecticut legislature 
to pass the PROTECT Act. The 
Act ensures that all incarcerated 
people can leave their cells for 
at least 6.5 hours per day, limits 
isolation confinement strictly to 
emergencies, and prohibits it from 
lasting  more than 72 hours in a 
14-day period. It also prohibits 
assigning members of vulnera­
ble groups (such as young peo­
ple, pregnant people, and people 
with mental illnesses or disabili­
ties) to solitary confinement, and 
guarantees access to medical and 
mental health supervision. The 
act would also prohibit excessive 
use of “in-cell restraints”—lock­
ing someone in a cell using metal 
shackles and chains for up to 72 
hours—and would guarantee one 
weekly 60-minute social contact 
visit to protect social bonds. 
The PROTECT Act was passed 
by the State House and Senate’s 
Joint Committee on the Judiciary 
overwhelming 
bipartisan 
support in April 2021, and in early 
June the full Senate voted to pass 
the Act. But on June 30 Governor 
Lamont vetoed it, in a move that 
activist groups like SSCT said was 
meant to appease the Correctional 
Officers’s Union, whose mem­
bers threatened to strike if the Act 
passed. In a statement at the time, 
Lamont claimed that the Act “puts 
the safety of incarcerated persons 
and correction employees at sub­
stantial risk…[and] places unrea­
sonable and dangerous limits on 
the use of restraints.” 
Instead, Lamont replaced the 
bill with an executive order that 
can be revoked at any time. The 
order provides people in solitary 
confinement just 4 hours out of 
their cells each day, and allows 
DoC to incarcerate people for 22 
hours per day for up to 15 days 
in a row, or 30 days in a 60-day 
period if an “exception” is granted. 
The order also contains no protec­
tions enabling inmates to preserve 
social bonds, places no limits on 
the use of in-cell restraints, and 
doesn’t guarantee adequate medi­
cal or mental health services. 
In 2019, Yale Law Professor 
Hope Metcalf, who has worked 
closely with SSCT, argued in a 
letter to the UN that Connecticut's 
practices of isolation and in-cell 
chaining qualify as torture. In 2020, 
the UN stated that prolonged soli­
tary confinement (without mean­
ingful human contact for 22 hours 
for more than 15 consecutive days) 


In a footnote, the author added:
It was hard to get a sense of what was 
going on in the outside world while in 
solitary confinement. All the windows 
were tinted with a painted black film, 
and it took Tracie a long time to finally 
scratch a little of it off.
