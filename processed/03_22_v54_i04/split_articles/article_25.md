of paper, this administrative bull­
shit, that keeps me from healing.”
Healing emotionally from the 
discharge may never be pos­
sible, but there is one way to 
bureaucratically erase the Oth­
er-than-Honorable discharge des­
ignation: applying to a discharge 
review board. Veterans of the 
Navy and Marines who believe 
they have been unfairly discharged 
can submit an application to the 
Naval Discharge Review Board 
(NDRB) and ask them to recon­
sider their discharge status. The 
Army and Airforce have their own 
boards. Last September, Burke put 
together a 70-page file to present 
to the NDRB. In October, Burke 
received his decision, in the form 
of a one-page response. “They 
just said, ‘Nope,’” Burke says. He 
wonders if they even read his file. 
“I'm a pastor of a church, and I 
went to Yale. And I'm not getting 
an upgrade, because I watched lit­
tle kids get blown up and smoked 
pot,” he says. “So, if I’m in this 
situation, I got to think that other 
applicants are much worse off than 
me.” 
Over 500,000 veterans are liv­
ing with Other-than-Honorable 
discharges. The NDRB rejects 85 
percent of discharge status upgrade 
requests, according to documents 
the Navy released in the 2016 set­
tlement of a Freedom of Informa­
tion Act lawsuit filed by two mil­
itary justice organizations against 
the Department of Defense. The 
military discharge review boards, 
according to guidelines instituted 
by then-Defense Secretary Chuck 
Hagel in 2014, now referred to 
as the Hagel memo, are asked to 
give “liberal consideration” to 
cases where service-related men­
tal health issues, like PTSD, could 
have contributed to the veter­
an’s behavior and led to the dis­
ciplinary discharge. But stories 
like Burke’s suggest that this isn’t 
playing out in reality.

Yale Law Jumps In
On March 2, 2018, the Yale Law 
School (YLS) Veteran Legal Ser­
vices Clinic filed a suit against the 
U.S. Navy, alleging its discharge 
review board process does not 
follow the Pentagon’s standards 
of giving “liberal consideration” 
to PTSD-related cases. On Octo­
ber 12, 2021, the court approved 
the Navy and YLS’s joint settle­
ment agreement—referred to as 
the Manker settlement, named 
after lead plaintiff Tyson Manker. 
A final fairness hearing for the 
case was held on December 16th. 
Now, a judge is reviewing the 
terms of the class action agree­
ment and determining whether 
the settlement will be finalized by 
the court.
In December 2021, Burke was 
hoping to join the settlement class 
of the Manker case. The settle­
ment’s terms stipulate that the 
NDRB would have to reevaluate 
the rejections of class members, 
with careful consideration given 
to mental health when relevant. 
Even though joining the settle­
ment class still wouldn’t guarantee 
an upgrade for Burke, it would 
bring him closer than he ever has 
been to receiving one. 
A source for the Navy’s defense 
asserts that commanders put careful 
consideration into their discharge 
delineation. “The commander isn’t 
making the decision in a vacuum. 
There are lots of touch points that 
the commander uses,” the source 
says. But, the source explained in a 
conversation, discharge decisions 
are at times being made under 
the extenuating circumstances of 
war, which may have an influ­
ence on the decision. “An officer 
separating out an enlisted person 
might be making that decision 
with limited information, under 
stress, while managing a battle,” 
the source says. Commanders 
always have to be focused on mis­
sion readiness—making sure their 
unit is ready for battle—and have 
to take action when someone isn’t 
serving the unit. From that per­
spective, there is little room for 
misbehavior. 
“Right here in New Haven, 
we have impacted the 
whole nation” 
“Yale’s veterans clinic has been 
a tremendous leader in mili­
tary law,” says Eugene Fidell, a 
nationally recognized military law 
expert, a Senior Research Scholar 
at YLS, and an Adjunct Professor 
of Law at NYU Law School. The 
Hagel memo itself, which brought 
mental health considerations into 
discharge review cases, came out 
of a case filed by YLS. A settlement 
with the Army Discharge Review 
Board, which rejects 45 percent 
of discharge upgrade applications, 
with terms similar to those in the 
Manker settlement, was finalized 
in April 2021. “So really, right 
here in New Haven, we have 
impacted the whole nation with 
this legislation that has passed,” 
Conley Monk, the lead plaintiff on 
the Hagel case, reflects.
Yale Law School’s first-rank 
reputation in military law may 
come as a surprise, considering 
the current and historical politi­
cal climate at the school. “There 
was a conscious manifestation of 
antiwar sentiment that came from 
the student body and faculty after 
Vietnam.” Fidell explains. “Some 
of that still exists today, but is 
starting to change.”

**Title: Yale Law School and Veterans' Rights**
**Page number(s): 23**

Jane Jacoby, the President of 
the YLS Democrats says that a 
large portion of the student body 
identify as on the left politically. 
“A vast majority of students at the 
Law School would likely describe 
themselves as Democrats. There 
are certainly a large portion of 
students 
that 
would 
describe 
themselves as far-left,” she says. 
Just a quick scroll through YLS’s 
clinical service program offer­
ings sheds insight as to why YLS 
may attract left-leaning students. 
Yale is home to thirty law clin­
ics—groups of students and faculty 
providing pro-bono legal services. 
Every student is required to spend 
one semester doing experien­
tial learning, either working in a 
clinic that tackles real world cases 
or taking a simulation course. 
Most are oriented toward progres­
sive causes, such as reproductive 
rights, LGBTQ rights, and capi­
tal punishment. Students in most 
clinics, like the Veterans Clinic, 
work under their faculty mem­
bers’ bar licenses in order to lead 
and take charge of cases.
Meghan Brooks, a Robert M. 
Cover Fellow at the Yale Veterans 
Clinic, describes the clinical learn­
ing process as, she says, “the same 
sort of idea as rotations at medical 
school.” But, Zoe Masters LAW 
’22, a student in the Fair Hous­
ing clinic, draws a key distinction. 
“If you’re in medical school and 
you’re doing rotations and spe­
cializing in different things, obvi­
ously that’s not political in any 
way. But in law school, the things 
that people choose to work on are 
informed by their view of justice,” 
she says. 
This is why Amelia Dunnell 
LAW ’23, a student lawyer rep­
resenting Tyson Manker in the 
settlement, struggled with her 
decision to work with the YLS 
Veterans Clinic. In her work, she 
feels a tension between her dedica­
tion to her clients and her personal 
skepticism of the military itself. “I 
have my own opinions and value 
judgments on the value of the 
military as a concept,” Dunnell 
says. “A lot of our clients are really 
proud of their military service, 
believe in the value of the military, 
and believe that it's an important 
institution and might not have 
the same criticisms against it that 
I would.” 
Dunnell isn’t the only one who 
has felt this way. Jane Jacoby, 
president of the YLS Democrats, 
knows many students working at 
the Veterans Clinic who would 
identify as Democrats. “That's 
not to say that there are not 
right-leaning members of the Vets 
Clinic. But I do think that veteran 
issues are ones that are important 
to both sides of the aisle. It doesn’t 
map onto partisan politics in the 
way that maybe some other clini­
cal offerings might,” she says. 
J.L. Pottenger, a Nathan Baker 
Clinical Professor of Law and 
Supervising Attorney at YLS, 
believes the clinic is tackling mil­
itary issues for the sake of justice, 
not for the sake of the institution 
itself. “I don't think that the Vet­
erans Clinic is a right-wing clinic. 
I don't think that people who go 
to it are more conservative,” he 
says. “And I don't think the Vet­
erans Clinic is about the values of 
the military or upholding them. 
It’s about trying to make sure that 
the veterans get fair treatment and 
the rights and the benefits that 
they were promised.” 
That’s the philosophy that has 
guided Amelia Dunnell’s work 
with the clinic. “It’s interest­
ing to work with clients whom 
you might have some, what you 
might perceive as, fundamen­
tal disagreements,” she says, “but 
whom you're also really dedicated 
to obtaining justice for, that you 
believe they're entitled to.”

Thomas Burke sees the cases 
coming out of the Yale veterans 
clinic as a beacon of justice in a 
military system that he thinks 
operates with a profound lack of 
it. He hopes the benefits of Yale’s 
legal victories will trickle down to 
his case as well. 
After 
two 
rejections, 
Steve 
Kennedy, the lead plaintiff for 
Yale Veterans Clinic settlement 
Board, was able to get his General 
Discharge upgraded as part of the 
settlement case. Kennedy spent 
fourteen months in Iraq serving 
in the 82nd Airborne Division of 
the U.S. Army. He returned with 
severe PTSD. His deteriorating 
mental health came to a head when 
he was denied permission to leave 
his station for ten days to attend 
his own wedding. Kennedy went 
AWOL (absent without approval). 
He was ultimately discharged 
under General conditions (which 
are considered less-than-Honor­
able). 
“It was really traumatic. For 
me, being in the Army was such a 
huge part of your identity. And to 
have the Army then turn around 
and say your services are less than 
Honorable, it's like you are less 
than Honorable,” Kennedy says. 
“I was already really depressed to 
begin with. And then I was kicked 
out, and after that, I was a mess.” 
But what gave Kennedy hope was 
a rumor that he had heard while 
enlisted, that discharges were easy 
to upgrade. “I heard it’s not a big 
deal. After six months, you just 
apply, they upgrade you, and it’s 
fine. But it’s not true. It’s not true 
at all.” Kennedy applied twice. 
He was denied both times, even 
though his application described 
mental health diagnoses link­
ing his PTSD to his active-duty 
behavior. The second time, he was 
denied on a three-to-two vote. 
Josh Britt LAW ’22 worked on 
Kennedy’s case at the Yale Veter­
ans Clinic. Before Yale, he served 
four years in the Marines Corps. 
While enlisted, he also had heard 
less-than-Honorable 
dis­
charges were a painless upgrade. 
Only when Britt started doing 
military justice work did he real­
ize how far that was from the 
truth. “The perception was that it 
was very easy to get a discharge 
upgrade,” he recalls of his time 
in the Marines. “So, the com­
mander was very quick to award 
discharges. 
He had no sense of their huge 
life-altering ramifications.” Ken­
nedy, in the years since his ser­
vice, has talked to commanders 
who are in the position to delin­
eate discharges. “I’ve heard that 
commanders just don’t appreciate 
what it actually means. You’re not 
thinking about what this person’s 
future looks like. It’s just you have 
to get your unit ready to go and 
this person isn’t working, so you 
send them out.” Kennedy says. 
“You're not thinking, well I bet­
ter make sure this person gets VA 
benefits.”
While there are regulations for 
determining what sort of behav­
ior merits a less-than-Honorable 
discharge, the power lies in a 
commander to enforce it. Guide­
lines provide little standardization, 
and as a result, personal biases 
often influence the decisions. A 
report from Protect Our Defend­
ers, a human rights organization 
focused on protecting vulner­
able service members, revealed 
that Black service members were 
more likely to face military dis­
ciplinary action. “The persistence 
of racial disparities within the 
military may indicate the exis­
tence of racial bias or discrimina­
tion among decision-makers in 
the military justice system,” the 
report concluded. Garry Monk, 
the brother of Conley Monk, who 
was the lead plaintiff in the YLS 
case about the Hagel Memo, and 
who does veteran advocacy work 
in New Haven, says, “It’s like Jim 
Crow in the military, for lack of a 
better word.”

‘There Are Right Ways 
to Behave . . .…and Few 
Excuses Allowed’
Brad Carson, a former Under 
Secretary of the Army, has a dif­
ferent view of the process. “The 
military is characterized by a 
strong adherence to standards and 
norms,” he explains. “There are 
right ways to behave. And there 
are few excuses allowed. That’s 
the kind of the culture of the place. 
It’s also a very rule driven place.” 
Discharge decisions are made with 
urgency when the stakes are life 
and death. That’s why the dis­
charge review boards were first 
formed, after World War Two—to 
reconsider decisions made under 
the pressure and haze of wartime 
in the light of civilian life.
The discharge review boards 
do not function like an appellate 
court in the American judicial sys­
tem. There is no jury of randomly 
selected civilians hearing the cases. 
The board is a set of military offi­
cers, some active and some retired, 
all of whom have a strong sense 
of military values, which colors 
how they view cases. “The peo­
ple who are deciding your case are 
the ones who have made a living 
in this system and are comfortable 
in it,” Kennedy remembers think­
ing when he was before the board 
himself. Though the board is 
given guidance from the Depart­
ment of Defense and Congress, 
and has administrative protocol, 
Carson says that there are no stan­
dard publications of guidelines 
that tell the board how to review 
each case. As a result, personal 
biases prevail, along with a strong 
deference towards the unit com­
mander’s original decision. “They 
have a real sense of standards and 
that there are behaviors that should 
get you separated from the mili­
tary with a less-than-Honorable 
discharge. And they believe stan­
dards are important to maintain,” 
Carson says. The stigma against 
PTSD that is felt on the ground in 
the military is felt on the board as 
well. “It’s still a highly testosterone 
culture,” Carson says. “Is there still 
some stigma to saying I’m weak or 
I’m suffering? Yes.”
It’s no wonder then that records 
referenced in the Manker settle­
ment’s original complaint assert 
that the Army Discharge Review 
Board rejects a substantial 45 
percent of cases, and the Naval 
Discharge Review Board rejects 
85 percent of discharge upgrade 
applications. Yet, while those per-
