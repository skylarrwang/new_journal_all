To the Editor:
The recent article "Blinded
with
Science" by W. Hampton Sides (TNJ
September 9, 1983), raised an in-
teresting and important question. Why
are Yale poets "in the dark" when it
comes to science? Is it because scientists
are not willing to teach them or is it
because they are in a preconditioned
state of mind which makes it difficult for
them to learn? I would like to suggest,
in disagreement with Mr. Sides, that it
is largely (if not completely) the latter
which leads to the present deplorable
state of affairs.


Many
Yale undergraduates,
like
many people in this country in general,
simply do not understand what science
is all about. They seem to believe, like
Mr. Sides, that learning about science
involves the acquisition of facts, facts
which often seem to them irrelevant. If
that were really the case, then most
scientists would also be "in the dark,"
since the number of known facts far .ex-
ceed the number that any individual
can acquire in a lifetime.


What distinguishes a scientist from
an uninformed layman is the way in
which he or she will approach a scien-
tific question. The scientist will analyze
the question in terms of specific con-
cepts,
often involving quantitative
estimates of several contributing fac-
tors. It is this analytical approach which
makes it possible to consider new ques-
tions for which all of the relevant facts
are not already established. It is this
same approach which is needed by the
non-science major on the floor of the
Senate debating an appropriations bill
for a new particle accelerator, or by the
homeowner considering the purchase of
a solar energy unit. The facts can
always be acquired if one can decide
just what facts are needed.


To learn this sort of approach,
students must first understand that
specific examples are designed to il-
lustrate the methods of science and not
just to teach the facts. Any student who
can understand the concepts of energy
conservation and efficiency will have a
much easier time figuring out if the
solar energy salesman is making real-
istic claims for the unit he is trying to
sell, even if he has never taken a course
in solar energy.


Fortunately, there are at Yale a
number of courses which stress this sort
of analytical approach. One of the most
successful of these, "Perspectives on
Technology," has been offered for more
than ten years by the Engineering
departments. In that course students
are asked to perform simple numerical
calculations which are relevant to real
problems, such as the small slices of
silicon which Mr. Sides craves, but still
many of the students have difficulty do-
ing the homework or the final exams.


Each year, a number of students do
seem to overcome these difficulties and
grasp the idea of analyzing a problem
quantitatively, and some even become
quite enthusiastic about science. Those
who have not yet found the key to
understanding what science is all about
should consider carefully if it is not
perhaps their built-in prejudice, that
science is just a collection of obscure
facts, which is keeping them in the
dark.


Sincerely yours,
