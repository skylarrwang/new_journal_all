Flash of the Spin't: African and Afro-
American Art and Philosophy by Robert 
Farris Thompson 
1983 Random House. $19.95. 317 pp. 
In 1968 Robert Farris Thompson, pro-
fessor of Art History at Yale and current 
master of Timothy Dwight College, 
mounted an exhibition for New York's 
Museum of Primitive Art, entitled 
"African and Afro-American Art: The 
Transatlantic Tradition." In this exhibi-
tion Professor Thompson juxtaposed 
West African works of art with art ob-
jects from Brazil, Surinam, Haiti and 
other countries in the western 
t:emisphere. His purpose in bringing 
together these seemingly divergent art 
regions was two-fold. First, he wanted 
to address the controversial idea of 
cultural continuities that persist within 
cultures in spite of years of social and 
political upheaval. Secondly, he wanted 
to identify Africa's aesthetic impact on 
the arts of the Americas, as seen in the 
cultural 
expressions 
of American 
blacks. 
Flash of the Spirit succeeds in ac-
complishing the inconceivable- an ex-
amination of five ancient civilizations of 
West and C5!ntral Africa-Yoruba, 
Kongo, 
Dahomean, Mande and 
Ejagham- for 
their artistic and 
philosophical influence on peoples of 
African descent 
in the 
Americas. 

Thompson's pairing of African and 
Afro-American artworks from these 
diverse groups 
trans~e,hds surface 
similarities. For example, in his chapter 
entitled "Black Saints Go Marching In: 
Yoruba Art and Culture 
m 
the 
Americas," Thompson makes a special 
point of tracing the history of Yoruba 
speakers and thinkers within American 
communities. 

Thompson acknowledges the cultural 
blendings that 
frequently 
present 
themselves on this side of the Atlantic. 
One example of this artistic "gumbo" is 
Haiti, where blacks reflect not only 
French Roman Catholic strains of 
cultural identity, but those of the Daho-
mean, Kongo, and Yoruba mind-sets as 
well. 

As one moves in this book from the 
Mande heartland of the Mali Empire, 
to the west coast of Mexico, back to 
Africa's savanna, and back across the 
Atlantic to Surinam, Kentucky, and 
M ississippi, 
one 
IS 
struck by 
Thompson's sense of intellectual 
transport. His methodological gift of 
vaulting the Atlantic in order better to 
understand the artistic traditions of 
both Africans and Afro-Americans is at 
times unsettling, but always on the 
mark. His perceptive translations of 
Cuban writers Lydia Cabrera and Don 
Fernando Ortiz, and his own field work 
in the barrios of New York and Miami 
illustrate the real pos'sibilities in learn-
ing about Africa through Afro-
America. 

Flash of the Spin't will no doubt be 
looked upon by rome as an overly am-
bitious project. Others will bemoan its 
modest format (i.e., no color illustra-
tions). But for many, especialiy those 
scholars who are witnesses of black in-
genuity in Africa, the Caribbean, Cen-
tral, 
South and North America, 
Thompson's book is long-awaited. As 
one of today's active voices in defining a 
specifically African impulse in art, 
Robert Farris Thompson's Flash of the 
Spirit celebrates the muse which holds 
dominion over a people's endurance 
and re-creation.

Richard Powell is a grad~JJJU student in the

Indeed, one might view Professor 
Thompson's latest book, Flash of the 
Spirit: African and Afro-American Art and 
Philosophy, as the belated catalogue and 
text for that 1968 exhibition. In Flash of · 
the Spin·~ Thompson explores the same 
issue he addressed in the 1968 exhibi-
tion- that of a "Black Atlantic Visual 
Tradition" which spans centuries, 
distances and slavery, artistically ex-
pressing itself in shared rhythms a"ld a 
common spiritual outlook.
