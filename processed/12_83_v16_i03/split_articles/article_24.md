The Owl of Expertise
The Search for Superior Knowledge

When I arrived at Yale, I thought somewhat vaguely of the Institution as a vessel which contained wisdom. To my. unenlightened eye the loud surety of the younger and the quiet surety of the older reflected some as yet unseen but apparently widely recognized metaphysical underpinning which lent moral weight to the frantic activity and ensured that the arrogance I saw everywhere was not simple snobbery. It embarrasses me now to confess such naivete.

I am spending this year studying various philosophical attitudes toward the relation between democracy and education , and I find it comforting that my naive view has a long history. Thomas Jefferson, for example, believed that a liberal arts education not only prepares, but entitles its recipients to govern the mass of men.

He wanted to replace birth with elite education as the ticket to political position. The magical capacity to confer authority, in the dual sense of both power and legitimacy, has of course been vested in universities since long before Jefferson, or even Yale, existed. Yet this belief in the power of education to confer authority, which holds so much sway in our culture, seems to be more and more absurd. These days, a man with a respected claim to political authority based upon education is known as an Acknowledged Expert. The magic of the university and of the Acknowledged Expert stand or fall together.


A few weeks ago a television program, "The Day After," dramatized the effects of nuclear war. After the mayhem 100 million Americans were faced with an even more macabre spectacle-a panel including Henry Kissinger, Carl Sagan, Bob MacNamara and William F. Buckley, all of whom presumed to explain to the public the meaning of what they had just seen. William Sloan Coffin was not present, but he did advertise in The New York Times that he would discuss the program after an open showing at the Riverside Church.

Why did these men presume to experience death and pontificate about it to the masses? Because they are educated men, men with the proper credentials-in short, Acknowledged Experts.

An example might clarify my distinction between an Acknowledged Expert and a true expert. Jefferson, in his role as an enthusiastic lobbyist for the creation of a new political aristocracy of men exposed to the classics through the benificance of the state, was an Acknowledged Expert. As a patient student of nature, using trial-and-error methods to explore physics, chemistry and botany, he became an expert in the science of his day.

Although their number is small, the tyranny of Acknowledged Experts muddies every corner of the twentieth century; the damage they have wrought telescopes into the future. I cannot prove that they are pernicious; it is only my intuition. But during my time at Yale I have become sure that they are not true experts.

An expert cannot help but teach, if only by example, while an Acknowledged Expert professes simply to know and often uses his knowledge as a rock with which to gain leverage over others. The conception of knowledge as private property to be bought or sold, hidden or destroyed, must have originated among the world's Acknowledged Experts. No view of knowledge could be more destructive politically.

Yale as an institution must shoulder some responsibility for this attitude, for, along with many gifted scholars and lovers of learning, Yale has produced more than her share of Acknowledged Experts. Yale is herself a symbol of Acknowledged Expertise, although, rather paradoxically, in the field of education. The atmosphere of Yale can breed the necessary arrogance as a form of self-defense against the secret knowledge of one's own ignorance. The tell-tale sign of the Acknowledged Expert is an over-emphasis on the "I" in debate combined with an unwillingness to get down to specifics, as if knowledge and ego, once joined, had become inseparable. The personality becomes the argument. One journalist recently described Averell Harriman, one of the most Acknowledged Experts in American foreign policy, as a man who needs to be "the bride at every wedding and the corpse at every funeral"; this might be the credo of the breed, for an unacknowledged Acknowledged Expert is inconceivable.

What then of Yale? What is the message of Yale's symbolic landscape? The owl hovering over Sterling Library, "the heart of the university," and brooding among the bricabrac on a dozen Yale buildings seems to be at the heart of this landscape. She was wisdom for the Greeks, and for the Egyptians, death. What will she be for Yale? That depends upon one's perspective.

What perspective is appropriate to the time? John Hersey, addressing the graduation ceremonies of my elementary school, told us to read the present with skepticism but not cynicism. I did not realize at the time how adult, and how cynical, his advice was. For if I were to summarize what I have learned at Yale, it would be that a skeptical reading of society- which is perhaps the closest thing to an intended result of a liberal arts education here -leaves one groping and confused but trusting in further education as a way out of moral paralysis. This leaves one in grave danger of falling under the thrall of Acknowledged Experts whose appealing self-confidence seems to signify possession of superior knowledge. Skepticism means doubting oneself; cynicism, doubting the Acknowledged Experts. The owl doesn't teach, but simply knows. Her mocking surety, which one may or may not take for wisdom, is Yale's symbol for the power of Acknowledged Expertise.

The core of my education at Yale has been the realization that education never grants moral authority. Jefferson was a brilliant optimist. Only a cynical reading of the owl as the symbol of a confidence-game allowed me to appreciate the true beauty of a Yale education. Only a degree of cynicism regarding the legitimacy and aims of a liberal arts education can free the individual who desires it to find moral authority elsewhere.
