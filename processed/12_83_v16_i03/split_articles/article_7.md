**Labor Pains: Fighting for a Contract**
**Author: News Journal**
**Page number(s): 8**

For over 15 years Yale has had tense 
relations with the unions that work for 
the University (see "The State of the 
Union," TN], February· 27, 1982). 
Now early contacts between the Uni-
versity and Local 34, the new union of 
secretaries, librarians and other clerical 
and technical workers, indicate that 
things are still less than rosy between 
Yale and its unionized work force. 

The clerical and technical employees 
voted to form a union last M ay after a 
lengthy and heated organizing cam-
paign that often found the University 
and the union at lo~erheads . In the six 
months since then, attempts to nego-
tiate a contract have bogged down. 

So far, the greatest problems have 
arisen over the issue of pay for members 
of the union neg?tiating committee who 
lose work hours during contract talks. 
O riginally, Yale felt that these people 
should receive no compensation for lost 
work. while the union felt that its 
negotiating team should not be pun-
ished for time spent on what it con-
sider ed "legitimate University 
business." Yale has since amended its 
position, saying that it will pay for one 
hour of time for each worker for each 
negotiating session, but Local 34 finds 
this position unacceptable. 

There are other issues keeping Yale 
and Local 34 away from the bargaining 
table: Yale's original claim that there 
was no room on campus suitable for 
contract talks, 
disagreements over 
whether negotiations should take place 
during working hours and controversy 
over what the actual shape of the 
negotiating table should be. 

The union puts the blame for these 
problems squarely on the University. 
They say that the University is squab-
bling over technical points to harass the 
new union and stall for time. As Debra 
Chernoff, a member of the union's 
negotiating committee, said, "The issue 
is how legitimate the University con-
siders this process; what they're trying 
to show is that these negotiations arc 
not legitimate University business. Ob-
viously, we think they are." 

Bruce Chisman, the University's new 
President of Administration, disagrees 
with this interpretation. "I don't see 
things as tense. We aren't bosom bud-
dies, but Yale's relations with Local 34 
are the best they can be under the cir-
cumstances inherent whenever labor 
meets management over the bargaining 
table. You could say that we're friendly 
adversaries. I know this may sound 
pompous, but ultimately I believe that 
reasonable men will sec the rightness of 
our position." 

If these disagreements are 
not 
worked out, Yale could have a serious 
problem. 
The 2500 clerical and 
technic_al empJoyees form a crucial part 
of Yale's work force. If they went on 
strike, the University would have a dif-
ficult time functioning, especially if the 
strike were supported with a walkout by 
Local 35, the union of Yale's dining hall 
and maintenance 
workers, 
which 
helped 
organize 
the clerical and 
technical workers into a "sister union" 
last spring. 


**The Hinckley Letters**

After John Hinckley Jr. shot President 
Reagan in the spring of 1981, Rollin 
Riggs '82 found -that the pictures he'd 
been taking of actress J odie Foster '!Vqe 
valuable-so he sold them to Newsweek 
for an unspecified amount ("The Yale 
Entrepreneurs," TN], October 21). 
Riggs is still trying to make money 
ofT of the Hinckley affair. On Nov-
ember 11 four letters written by Hin-
ckley to R iggs were offered for sale at an 
auction in New York. 

Riggs refuses to cotr\ment on this in-
cident except to confirm that he did of-
fer the letters to the Charles Hamiltorf 
Gallery, 'the well-known New York 
handwriting firm which played an im-
portant role in exposing the forged 
Hitler diaries. Apparently, Riggs wrote 
to Hinckley in August of last year and 
asked if he could photograph the would-
be assassin. Hinckley wrote back saying . 
he would be happy to let Riggs take ex-
clusive photographs if Riggs would 
deliver a letter to Jodie Foster for him. 
He also asked Riggs to "keep track of 
her movements" and send the pictures 
he had taken of Foster. 

Riggs was shocked by these requests, 
according to The New York Post. He told 
the Post that he had written to Hinckley 
as a "professional photo-journalist" and 
had never intended to help him. Still, 
the Post ref>orts that he did send Hinck-
ley several pictures of Foster that had 
already been published, though he 
stopped short of delivering the love let-
ters to the actress. 

After exchanging several letters, 
Hinckley decided that Riggs was not 
going to help him any more than he 
already had, and the correspondence 
ended in September, less than two 
months after Riggs' first letter. 

But not every idea can turn a profit. 
No one at the auction bought the let-
ters which were offered at a starting 
price of $500. 


**Hamster Madness**
**Page number(s): 9**

It's no secret that four hamsters escaped 
from Yale's Laboratory of Epidemi-
ology and Public Health (LEPH)- at 
least not to readers of The New York 
Times, which covered the event in its 
Connecticut 
section. 
But 
the cir-
cumstances surrounding the lethal 
disease th«Y were carrying remain 
shrouded in m ystery. 

The missing animals had been in-
j~cted with Creutzfeld-J akob (CJ) 
VIrus, a mysterious ailment that at-
tacks the central nervous system and 
causes the brain to decay. The mortality 
t-ate for animals carrying the disease is 
100 
percent, 
although the latency 
period can last for several years. For-
tunately, the only known way of con-
tracting the disease is through direct in-
jection into the brain, though one out of 
a million contract it each year. 

The disease is so mysterious that a 
number of graduate students at LEPH 
believe that the experiment might be 
part of Department of Defense research 
into the possible use of CJ virus for 
germ warfare. Dr. Edward Adelberg, 
Deputy Provost of bio-medical science 
at LEPH, dismisses this charge, though 
he acknowledges that all of the money 
for the project came from the National 
Institutes of H ealth in Washington. 

Adelberg maintains that CJ virus would 
be a poor choice of materials in a germ 
war because there is no known antidote 
and thus no way of protecting one's own 
troops from the disease's debilitating ef-
fects. He points out that all research at 
Yale is unclassified and maintains that 
Yale's research into Cj virus is purely 
scientific. 

The hamsters that escaped from 
,.LEPH are not the first animals to get 
l~se. The laboratory has had a recur-
rmg problem with the safety latches on 
many of its cages. In fact, escapes have 
been so frequent that the technicians on 
duty at LEPH did not even report this 
escape to their supervisors when they 
discovered the empty cages on October 
3. A regular inspection conducted a 
week later first brought the matter to 
the attention of LEPH's bio-medical 
safety department, and a public an-
nouncement soon followed. 

Adelberg 
believes 
that the 
runaway rodents pose little threat to the 
Yale community. H e has suggested that 
th~ hamsters were incinerated in a bag 
of waste bedding they might have bur-
rowed into. One of the hamsters has 
already been found dead on the floor of 
the laboratory, but the other three re-
main unaccounted for.
