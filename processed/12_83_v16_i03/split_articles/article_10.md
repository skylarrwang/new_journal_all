·LANA 
A Story of Scarlet Letters 
and Public Risks 
W. Hampton Sides 
The hookers hang out just down Chapel 
Street from a grid-pattern park filled 
with concrete posts, brown paper bags 
and busted glass. The women stand 
against the traffic signs in their platform 
heels and fake furs, smoking cigarettes 
in the black voids between the street-
lamps. One of them might move toward 
your window, ask if you want a good 
time or maybe go for a car ride. 
It is not New Haven's worst area-
far from it. Yale is only a few blocks 
away. Still, it is not much of. a 
neighborhood to be standing out on 
windy streetcorners in the middle of the 
night. 

This is Lana's neighborhood, where 
she hangs out. Lana has been a pros-
titute since she was a teenager. She has 
been with all kinds of people over the 
last nine years- neighborhood acquain-
tances, local businessmen, even Yale 
students from time to time. Hers is a 
story of eviction notices, needles and a 
broken home. Up until a year and a half 
ago, Lana was no different from any 
other New Haven prostitute; but then 
something happened. 

Lana thought it was a miracle when 
she discovered that she was pregnant, so 
she decided to have the baby. But not 
long after her son was born, the doctors 
at Yale-New H aven H ospital told her 
that he had a serious disease and would 
have to stay at the hospital indefinitely. 
H er baby, they said, had contracted 
AIDS, almost certainly in the womb. 

Lana had yet to show signs of the 
syndrome, but her past as a prostitute 
and an I. V. drug user placed her in two 
risk categories for AIDS. Although the 
disease was overwhelmingly associated 
with homosexuals in the public eye, 17 
prostitutes across the country had 
already died of AIDS since 1978, and 
some 600 I. V. drug users had also con-
tracted it. So Lana was almost certainly 
a carrier, if not a victim. 

Lana and her baby are not the first 
people in the area to come in contact 
with this 100 percent fatal syndrome 
which destroys the body's defenses 
against 
infection. 

Yale-New Haven 
Hospital has diagnosed over 25 AIDS 
cases from all over Connecticut so far 
(more than half of whom have died). 
The AIDS clinic has also been following 
over 250 outpatients who either have 
AIDS in its early stages or are at high 
risk. In May, a 29-year-old resident 
physician at Yale-New Haven died of 
AIDS, though his death received no at-
tention either at Yale 01· in the city 
papers. Still the risks in New Haven are 
small, particularly for a city 70 miles 
from New York City, where half the 
world's 2,500 AIDS. cases have been 
reported. 

Seven months after Lana's baby was 
diagnosed, he is still in a special care 
pediatric ward at Yale-New H aven. He 
will probably die within the year, most 
likely of opportunistic infections or 
Kaposi's sarcoma, a rare form of cancer 
associated with AIDS. All told, it will 
cost the government and the hospital 
between $60,000 and $300,000 to keep 
the baby alive as long as technology can 
sustain him. 

Meanwhile, Lana has had to resume 
her life on the streets to support herself 
and her $200-a-day heroin dependency. 
In October, she was taken off an out-
patient methadone program funded 
through Connecticut Mental Health 
Center when a routine urine test re-
vealed that she was back on heroin. 

Public health officials were growing 
concerned that she might be sharing her 
needles with some of her customers and 
friends. H er blood test had shown a low 
T-cell count, which can be an early 
symptom of AIDS as well as any 
number of common infections. 

The physicians were unsure about 
her status because AIDS is an unusually 
difficult disease to diagnose. It has a six-
month to three-year incubation period. 
Further, pathologists have identified 
three distinct stages of the illness, and 
only when a person reaches the third 
stage can a doctor verify that he or she 
has the disease. 

Last week Lana checked into a city 
hospital with pneumonia, another early 
indication of AIDS. The evidence was 
conclusive enough 
to 
prompt 
the 
hospital officials to place her in strict 
isolation as.a "presumed" AIDS patient. 
Anyone who wished to enter her room 
was required to wear a white gortex 
smock, surgical gloves and a mask. Any 
unprotected o~jects that one carried out 
had to be destroyed for fear of con-
tamination. One of the nurses ex-
pressed bewilderment that people would 
risk going into the isolation room "with 
an AIDS patient in there." The hospital 
was filled with forgone conclusions 
about a patient with pneumonia. It 
seemed strange that for all the commo-
tion abou(•AIDS, the hospital planned 
to let her out the next day. 

Inside her room, Lana was smoking 
a cigarette and watching Happy Days. 
She didn't like the fact that her guests 
had to wear space suits. She pulled 
down three polaroid snapshots of her 
baby from the wall. What were the 
strangers scared about? She had been 
hustling for nine years. If she was going 
to give anything to anybody, it was tOO 
late to start worrying about it now. 
Anyway, tomorrow she would be out-
side again.

Word about Lana and her baby had 
begun to circulate in the community as 
early as July. A few irresponsible 
rumors surfaced about a modern-day 
Typhoid Mary walking the streets. The 
Health Department found out about the 
case, though there was little it could do 
but monitor the situation indirectly 
through the hospital. "What do you do 
with a potential AIDS carrier who 
refuses to cooperate- put her in jail?" 
asked Lisa Stone, the Assistant to the 
Health Department Director, who has 
been monitoring AIDS cases in New 
Haven. "In fact, we are not allowed 
under the law to do anything.~ Dr. 
Randolph Young, one of the physicians 
on the AIDS team at Yale-New Haven; 
concurred: "It is not necessary for a per-
~on to have stage three AIDS in order to 
transmit it to another person. But one 
would have to think long and hard 
before violating someone's rights in the 
name of public health. You would have 
to be c<>nvinced that you could do some 
good. At this point, I am not." 

Police Chief William Farrell found 
out too, though the Department was not 
about to arrest anybody for being sick. 
"We could have patrolmen out on the 
streets tracking down individuals who 
haven't committed crimes," said Sgt. 
Joe Polio. "But then we're talking ab<>ut 
something closely akin to the witch 
hunts of Salem." Soon 
the city's 
newspaper learned ab<>ut Lana's baby. 
"One of the confirmed AIDS cases [at 
Yale-New Haven] ... is a baby whose 
mother is an intravenous drug abuser 
and a prostitute," wrote Joan Barbuto 
in the Ntw Haven Rtgister on July 9. 
That was the first and last press atten-
tion the case received, and even then it 
was buried on page 25 of the paper. 

The authorities said the confusion 
s~rrounding the transmission of the 
• dtsease was one reason why they had 
taken so little action. No clear evidence 
t:xisted that proved a woman could sex-
ually transmit AIDS 10 a man. "We 


can't even positively p rove that AIDS is 
transmitted from one man to another 
man," said Bill Sabella, the Connecticut 
State Epidemiologist for AIDS in H art-
ford. "We can only surmise. I mean we 
don't have an organism we can look at 
under a microscope like we do with 
most communicable diseases." There 
was no legal or medical justification for 
making Lana's private life as a pros-
titute a matter of public concern. 

Since the summer, Lana has unknow-
ingly become a focal point in the larger 
debate about AIDS in the Yale-New 
Haven community. 
Seldom has a 
hooker been the topic of conversation 
among so many high-level officials. 
Certainly a story about a d rug-abusing 
prostitute who gave birth to an infant 
with AIDS is the glaring exception to a 
number of rules. But it nonetheless 
brings to light- in a graphic and ap-
parently unprecedented way-the mul-
titude of legal and ethical questions 
which arise from a puzzling new disease 
in which there are, in the end, no real 
authorities. 

"T here are some real competing in-
terests in this case," acknowledged Lisa 
Stone. "But at the same time, you don't 
want that to become an excuse for doing 
nothing. I'm not trying to shirk my 
responsibilities as a health officiaL But 
can you imagine what would happen if 
a local-level agency started making its 
own policies about how to handle in-
dividual AIDS cases? We would run in-
to all sorts of inconsistencies, and it is 
inconsistency that leads to lawsuits. 

"O ur society does a decent job of try-
ing to balance those interests. Civil 
liberties have obviously made a lot of 
progress in the last few decades. It used 
to be that people with tuberculosis could 
literally be picked up off the streets and 
th rown into a sanitarium indefinitely. 
T he TB laws have long since been 
changed. With AIDS, it is even trickier. 
W e would all like things to move faster, 
but that's democracy- that's bureau-
cracy. That's the way it works." 

But others sense a more urgent need 
for action. The Reverend Paul Keane, 
a 1980 graduate of the Yale Divinity 
School who has played an active role in 
AIDS education issues in New Haven, 
has been concerned about Lana's pro-
gress for five months now. The pamph-
lets he helps write on topics like "Aids, 
Sex and You" are well-known to most 
Yale students. Keane has stridently 
criticized the state and local health 
departments for floundering in red tape 
while accomplishing nothing. "All the 
officials in this matter are ethically 
paralyzed," Keane argued. "They are 
falling back on all sorts of legal 
precedents that no longer apply in this 
case. We. are on the brink of a society 
that is virt~ally powerless to act on mat-
ters of moral concern. We're not talking 
about the private lives of gay men. 
We're talking about a woman whose 
business is exchanging body fluids. It is 
a public business, the merchandising of 
which may be fatal. And her recrea-
tional habit as an I. V. drug user is 
equal cause for concern." 

Dr. Alvin Novick, a Yale biology ~ 
professor who has been a leading figure 
in AIDS research and education in the 
Yale-New H aven community, has cer-
tain qualms with Keane's agenda. He 
believes that Keane, by focusing atten-
tion upon the more dramatic issue of an
