liberalism, 
anti-intellectualism, shal-
lowness and decadent social mores of 
the Yale student body. They want to 
escape 
impersonal 
institutions and 
amorphous crowds. They want to enter 
a cozy hall of mirrors where they can 
see 
faces 
and 
hear voices which 
welcome them, which assure them that 
they arc somebody, which assure them 
that community and fraternity can still 
be created in the midst.of modernity. 

Most of the criticismÂ· about the Party 
involves 
its 
recruitment of Yale 
freshmen. 
Richard 
Sorkin, 
who 
dropped out of the POR after being 
elected its Chief Whip during his 
freshman year, now sees the Party as a 
social crutch for lonely freshman. "The 
POR seeks out and finds social misfits," 
Sorkin says, "those freshmen who were 
obviously more intelligent but less 
socially accepted than the average high 
school senior. Suddenly, the POR tells 
these people that 'It's cool to be an in-
tellectual' and actually assures them that 
thev're better than everyone else.'" 
Ira Shapiro, lormer Chairman of the 
Tory Party (the POR's bnter enemy in 
the Political Union), describes the 
recruitment process as "love-bombing" 
and Jon Edward Lendon, who was ap-
proached by the Party last year. readily 
agrees. Lendon recalls that POR mem-
bers "would politely listen to what you 
said, regardless of how stupid it was, 
and would pretend to be interested. 
Having these impressive upperclassmen 
tell you how splendid you are is certain-
ly flattering." In the end, though, Len-
don found the recruitment process "ex-
tremely calculating" and decided not to 
join. "I soon got calls from former 
Chairmen," he explains, "individuals I 
hadn't even met. It became obvious that 
they were just processing me." 
According to Shapiro the POR has a 
tremendous psychological effect on 
those freshmen who do join. "There is 
an institutionalized arrogance which 
they all share. They really begin to 
believe that only they can think in-
telligently. 
Alex Whiting, Chairman of the Pol-
itical Union's Liberal Party, says that 
"the POR flatters lonely freshmen by 
giving them the impression that they'll 
walk out of Old Campus with a coat 
and tie on Friday night and suddenly 
become the object of jealousy." And, in 
his resignation letter, Sorkin told the 
POR Chairman that "there is no senior 
member whose ego has not been fueled, 
whose insecurities have not been fed, 
whose obsession with power has not 
been encouraged by this organization." 
Sorkin points out that only people who 
are members of the POR can sign a 
middle name in the guest book at party 
events. If a non-member signs a middle 
name, it is crossed out. 
Alex Whiting agrees that "the overall 
effect of the POR is negative because 
the self-importance it breeds is false . 
The members have pride, but no hu-
mility." (POR member Mike Fischer, 
for example, says that "the POR is an 
organization designed to attract the best 
and the brightest at Yale, the intellec-
tual wundokind of the Yale community.") 
"The POR is just like a cult," says 
Sorkin. "You become brainwashed to do 
stupid things on an interpersonal level. 
You become insensitive to other people, 
contentious and arrogant. 1f you're 
disliked by others, the POR tells you 
that it's because you're better, not 
because you're strange. You soon get 
positive reinforcement for causing con-
troversy. Doing something obnoxious 
brings the group's acceptance and the 
reinforcement of your new self-image. 
You begin to believe that people are 
upset with you because you're doing 
something great, demonstrating your 
superiority." 

Liberal Party Chairman Whiting 
argues that the majority of the members 
of the POR "limit their activities and 
their friends to the group. This is not at 
all true of the other parties in the 
Union." For many POR members this 
limitation carries over into their adult 
lives. The Party elects its members, in 
its own words, for "life, at least." It is 
not uncommon to find POR members 
marrying each other after graduation. 
"POR members are insecure on their 
own," says Whiting, "but the Party 
cultivates their insecurity. Its members 
don't have to tackle the social aspects of 
Yale because they create their own pro-
tected world of mutual flattery." 

Of course, POR members describe 
their behavior quite differently. If they 
are obnoxious or insular, they see it as a 
, response to a hostile Yale community. 
Former POR Chairman Bhattacharji, 
for example, explains that "some people 
in the Party tend to be very defensive 
and battle the prejudice of others with 
their own prejudice. They feel that peo-
ple who are critical have nothing of any 
importance to say." 

But many POR members themselves 
recognize that these problems are real. 
Mike Fischer recognizes that "the Party 
can have a very bad effect on parasitic 
people who will use it as an organiza-
tion that they can cling to isolate and 
themselves with. But that's not the pur-
pose of the POR, and it is not the way it 
usually works." 

John Zmirak agrees that the POR 
provides some members with "a comfor-
ting background in which to play out 
their neuroses." But he sees the Party's 
behavior pardy as a response to its 
negative image at Yale. "I think the Par-
ty gets tired of being ridiculed and 
sometimes purposely tries to live up to 
the image that's being ridiculed." 

As for the Party's "institutionalized 
arrogance," Chairman Victor Caston 
explains that "putting oneself in intellec-
tual combat and 
scoring victories 
naturally leads to a great deal of con-
fidence. People who find no acceptance 
anywhere sometimes find tolerance in 
the Party. But in fact, very few 
members of the Party of the Right hold 
fanatical views. Most members are 
quite willing to argue with anyone. 


Labelling the POR 'fascist', on the other 
hand, is willful ignorance. It's all too 
easy to label your opponents oddballs or 
extremists." 

But some individual members of the 
Party do hold extreme views . .John 
Zmirak, a self-described fascist, says, "I 
like the idea of coming in and reversing 
social change, if necessary by force." 
One social change Zmirak is particular-
ly eager to reverse is the growing accep-
tance of homosexual lifestyles. "If I were 
POR C hairman, I wouldn't tell (gay 
members) when events were being held 
. . . and that tends to discourage atten-
dance." 

Last year, during GLAD Week, 
while many gay students wore pink 
triangle 
buttons, 
Zmirak proudly 
sported a pink trian gle with a black 
slash through it. One evening in CCL 
another student approached him and 
said, "I'm offended by your button; 
homosexuality is just an alternative 
lifestyle." Zmirak 
replied, "So is 
schizophrenia" and was promptly spat 
upon by the other student. A week 
later he was beaten up by two in-
dividuals at a Saybrook SAC party. 
"I have well-reasoned ideas," argues 
Zmirak. "I have principles from which 
my politics follow." But other POR 
members take strong exception to 
Zmirak's views. M ike Fischer says, 
"The rest of us find those views repug-
nant and disgusting." And Chairman 
Caston finds Zmirak to be "an excep-
tionally rude human being who has 
very little sophistication about him. I 
can't see in any way that this would be 
supported by the Party structure. The 
institution leans very heavily against 
such acts of intolerance. Whenever 
anyone in the Party has acted un-
gentlemanly 
in 
public, 
we 
have 
reprimanded him." 

Zmirak though, points out that "there 
are at least three or four members of the 
Party who share my views. In fact, 12 of 
30 members voted against the election 
of a recent petitioner largely because he 
was flagrantly homosexual. The Party 
also has many extreme libertarians-
individuals who argue for child por-
nography and free heroin use." 

Yet many members, like Fischer, are 
wary of including extremists jn the Par-
ty. "There's.too much willingness to ac-
cept the views of the few extremists that
