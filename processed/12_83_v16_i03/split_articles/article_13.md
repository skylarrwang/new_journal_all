Party members, raise your glass,
Drain the Green Cup as it passes
Hail, all merry lads and lasses
The Party of the Right!
Though we can't leap for classes
Stand opposed by soulless masses,
Yet our excellence surpasses
The future still looks bright


The silver chalice passes quickly
to the right at Mory's. The Green
Cup soothes the throats of 40 men
and women who have been toasting,
laughing and singing for hours. It has
been an evening of tradition and mar-
tyred monarchs, an evening filled with
jokes about the Reds and the bleeding
hearts, and songs about a Yale that is
no more. Outside, through the closed
Front Room windows along York
Street, the spectacle may make a
momentary impression. Some people
may think these revelers are just odd-
balls. Some people may think they are
conservatives without a cause. Others
may think they are fascists who wound
up at the wrong university, at the
wrong time and in the wrong country.
But few people at Yale pay much atten-
tion to the Party of the Right.

Some 20 years ago, the Liberal Party
also had wasting sessions at Mory's,
drinking Red Cups and passing them to
the left, of course. Today most liberals,
and in fact most Yale students, have
abandoned such traditions. But on an
average of once a month the Party of
the Right still convenes here for these
long evenings of wit and song. To
understand this eccentric group, one
has to consider its traditions, its color
and its critics. Most people never try.
Mike Fischer, who won the Political
Union's Freshman Prize Debate two
years ago, began his Yale career as a
liberal. "But much to my chagrin," he
remembers, "I found that the Party of
the Right was the only place that had a
real commitment to the search for
truth." Fischer soon joined the POR
while still serving as Floor Leader of the
Left in the Political Union. Today he is

a traditionalist conservative.

Fischer's conversion illustrates one of
the most surprising features about the
POR: the Party does not expect its
members to subscribe to a conservative
political persuasion as a criterion for
membership. It insists, somewhat whimsically, that "we don't care what you
think, only that you think, because if
you do think, pretty soon you'll think as
we think." In fact, the Party is often
severely divided in its debates, and its
members espouse a variety of political
ideologies. The largest portion of the
membership consists of traditionalists
and libertarians, but the Party always
includes a smattering of monarchists,
fascists, liberals, socialists and even an
occasional Trotskyite. Fischer, the con-
verted lefty, still enjoys "having liberals
to argue with" and feels "the liberals we
elect are the best."

But of all the Party's philosophical
divisions, the conflict between libertarians and traditionalists (Libs and
Trads) has led to the most dramatic
confrontations.
In
1976 Chairman
Wendell Raleigh Bird conducted what
is now referred to as the Party's Second
Purge (the first occurred in the late
'60s). Bird, an avowed traditionalist
now with the Moral Majority, accused
many Party members of "academic
dishonesty, marijuana bribes, burgeoning cohabitation, Nazi songs, and
musical bedrooms," and used "the absolute power of the Chairman" to expel
30 prominent members. These
members included such notables as
Richard Brookhiser, senior editor of the
National Review, and Andrei Navrozov,
who is now infamous for his battle with
the University over the status of the Yale
Literary Magazine.

Despite such bitter conflicts, the
POR is usually united in its dedication
to decorous, intellectual debate. Sometimes humorous and sometimes serious,
the weekly philosophical debates are the
Party's main function. Topics range
from "Resolved: Philadelphia is the
Hope of the West" to "Resolved:
Reason Cannot Withstand the Fall of
God" to "Resolved: The Vietnam War
was a Noble Cause." POR member
Farced Zakaria maintains that the Party
is "the only intelligent forum at Yale
where ideas are being analyzed beyond
their public posture or the rhetoric of
The New York Times." Former Chairman
Sandip Bhattacharji says, "The people
in the Party spend far more time thinking about political issues than the
average person at Yale. Too often,
political debate on campus, when it occurs, simply revolves around a few
facts."

The Party is also united in its dedication to the many traditions, whether in-
ane or inviolate, which have colored its
past. "We take tradition seriously,"
observes
present Chairman Victor
Caston, "but at the same time we have a
number of traditions that are clearly
ludicrous." For example, all new Party
members are entitled, upon election, to
choose a new middle name with which
to sign the Party's guest book. Thus
Garrett Spitzer becomes Garrett Faber-
tignarius Spitzer at Party
events.

Members also hold titles such as
Chancellor of Cards and Games,
Purveyor of Tobacco to the Executive
Committee and Bearer of the Imperial
Inkblot. And two offices are reserved
for freshmen: the Napafer (awarded to
the most obnoxious new member) and
the Manciple (who must run to WaWa's
for sundry items such as ice or onion
dip at the behest of the Chancellor).

A POR toasting session is a full-scale
exercise in tradition. It opens with the
Chairman's rendition of the last words
of King Charles I, words uttered before
the monarch's execution at the hands of
Cromwell's army. To the Party, Charles
I is a symbol of rightful authority
usurped by the "will of the people" only
to be replaced by something worse.
"Most people in the Party now would
concede that Charles was a fairly rotten
monarch," admits Bhattacharji. "But his
speech before his execution expresses a
rather profound and wise synthesis of
the Party's perspectives." After the


de co bo b

speech, the Secretary-Treasurer follows
with a reverent recitation of the names
of all the kings and queens of England,
starting with ninth century Egbert and
concluding with Elizabeth, "long may
she reign."

Aside from these monthly toasting
sessions, the POR calendar is marked
by a number of traditional events. In
the fall there is the Orgy, a supposedly
libidinous drinkfest which is actually a
subdued,
black-tie cocktail
party.
Throughout the year, there are Cards
and Games nights at which members
play chess, Risk and even five-card
poker. In February the Party holds a
remarkably well-attended alumni banquet. And in the spring Party members
climb to the top of East Rock to hold a
picnic and burn a biography of the
hated Oliver Cromwell.

The Party is mostly self-effacing
about these traditions. "Our humor is
somewhat more sarcastic and iconoclastic than the general humor at Yale,"
says Zakaria, "and that's why some people tend to take it so badly. It's very
much British in tradition." For example, in the middle of a February night
last year, a group of POR members sang
a Party song called "Stomping Out the
Reds" to Dan Berkowitz, a TA for Professor
Wolfgang Leonhard's Soviet
History course:

(final verse)
Bayonets bright gleaming, Shermans
forward steaming
Hear the Commies screaming underneath
our treads
Scorn their masses teeming, and their
traitors scheming
We're the West redeeming, stomping
out the Reds!

Apart from their right-wing revelries
and
left-field
pranks,
the
POR
members observe a number of more
serious traditions. The Party has two
symbols of power: the Chairman's gold
medallion (an authentic piece minted
several hundred years ago to commemorate Charles I) and the Chairman's gavel (a somewhat less impressive
object machine-crafted by a local trophy
company about 30 years ago). Both
symbols are regarded with the same
respect that is held for the Chairman.
"The POR Chairman is the Party's
King," says Bhattacharji, "Not as a
despot, but rather as a philosopher king
or enlightened monarch."

Despite its many traditions, however,
the POR is not exactly the party of the
Old Yale milieu that it is made out to
be. For an admittedly reactionary
organization, the POR is quick to point
out that it has been notably responsive
to social change. The POR claims to
have elected the first women leader of
any undergraduate organization, Gail
Schwartz. Further, black POR member
Kevin Thomas was instrumental in
drafting the constitution for the Black
Student Alliance at Yale in the '70s.
And the POR has had four Jewish
Chairmen in the last six years.

In addition, the present party has a
diverse socio-economic composition.
Though it does include landed nobility
from countries such as Italy and India,
some of its members are of strictly
working-class lineage. One of the POR's
most vocal members, John Zmirak,
proudly asserts, "My father is a door-
man for a Park Avenue building not
far from the homes of many Yale
liberals."

Still, the manners and behavior of
POR members has led many critics to
describe the Party as a bizarre, reactionary cult. Detractors argue that the
Party members are escapists. They
want to escape what they perceive as the
