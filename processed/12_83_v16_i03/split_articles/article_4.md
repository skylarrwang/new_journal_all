While reading Eric Brende's article
"Dissection vs. Delight," (TNJ, October
21, 1983) initially I agreed with his
denunciation of the way his English 129
professor overemphasized the deeper
analytical questions at the expense of
the simple delights found in the
language itself. Where Brende goes
wrong is when he uses this example to
generalize about the way in which the
humanities are taught at Yale.


I have had many professors at Yale
who have concentrated on fusing the
students' experience with the information
under study. Master Thompson,
whose course has recently been de-
graded by Newsweek, goes one step fur-
ther by allowing his students to ex-
perience African culture
first-hand.


through the use of slides, music and
dance.


Master Thompson, along with many
other enthusiastic professors at Yale,
constantly stimulates the material by ac-
tively encouraging delight. Thus, the
renaissance which Brende is looking for
can be found right here at Yale. You
just have to know where to look for it.
