**Title: The Entrepreneurial Spirit**
**Author: Thomas McCance, Jr.**
**Page number(s): 5**

I was interested to read your recent article,
"The Yale Entrepreneurs," (TNJ,
October 21, 1983). I was surprised to
note, however, that you did not mention
the 1983 Quarter Century Fund in
your piece on Skip Klein. Although the
35-year-old Quarter Century Fund is
not strictly entrepreneurial, it does re-
quire an entrepreneurial spirit in its
senior class leadership.


Skip served as Chairman of the 1983
QCF last year, and under his leadership
it raised $12,000 in pledges and $9,000
in cash from the Class of 1983. He and
his 140 senior volunteers broke the all-
time money record which had been
previously held for 14 years by the Class
of 1969 and reached the highest par-
ticipation in ten years.


I was also privileged to read Skip's
brilliant essay on the Yale Endowment.
My opinion of his imagination and
competence could not be higher.

**Title: Progress Through Divestment**
**Author: Will Masters**

I read with great interest and pleasure
Kathleen Cleaver's interview with
Master Robin Winks (TNJ, October). I
agreed with Master Winks' commit-
ment to "seeing for himself" and his will-
ingness to break an informal, perhaps
counter-productive educators' boycott.
Winks was probably able to teach future
Afrikaner leaders something other than
what their parents and press were say-
ing.


However, I must respond to his
dismissal of the divestment movement
at Yale. Just as progressives within
South Africa must look hard to find
ways towards progress in their country,
so must we search for actions more ef-
fective than the current U.S. corporate
and government consensus of "Con-
structive Engagement."


The vast majority of both opposition
leaders in Africa, and anti-apartheid
groups in other countries, agree that
divestment from South Africa is a
positive step. Divestment is in no way
like a consumer boycott, like "taking
Russian vodka off the shelf." Not to buy
a product is to deny someone a small
amount of profit. To do business in
South Africa is to support actively the
Afrikaner government. Through pro-
viding services and paying taxes, com-
panies bring to the government that
which it needs to maintain its repres-
sion. Such support, no matter how
qualified by political rhetoric or private
charity, cannot be seen as a progressive
force. In South Africa, government
control of commerce is ubiquitous. The
government ensures that commerce
functions in its interest, and that the
human and physical capital of the
business community can be turned to
the state's needs and demand.


Foreign companies lending them-
selves to this process do not have an ef-
fective voice in state policy, and Yale
does not have an effective voice in the
companies it invests in. Given the con-
tributions our investments make to the
intolerable government of South Africa,
any divestment is a good thing.


No one here believes we can "bring
apartheid crumbling to the ground."
We only believe we can do justice to our
progressive beliefs, and contribute to a
better use of our endowment. It is pro-
gress itself that will bring down apar-
theid, in its own due time.
