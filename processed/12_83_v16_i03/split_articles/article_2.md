EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
3:15 A.M. is the bewitching hour.
Most people who die do it at 3:15. In
The Amityville Horror all the bad things
happened at 3:15. It's 3:15. Even the
Ides of March is on 3/15. Now it's
3:16. I hate the neon red numbers on
my alarm clock. I'm an English major.
I have no left brain. I hate numbers.
Especially 3, 1 and 7.


Something bad is happening at this
horrible hour. Or rather, not happening. My last paper of the semester is
still being born .(being still-born?), 20
hours after I started it, six before it is
due. Five hours and 42 minutes.
Songs run through my head to the
beat of the rubber band in my rickety
electric typewriter. I turn it off (the
typewriter? my head? both) and sadly
begin once again to clean my desk.
A paper shouldn't be this difficult.
Each semester Yale students hand in
almost
half a
million
sheets of
8 Â½ -by-11 inch medium-white bond.
After D.S. and Nightly Themes I
should be accustomed to putting my
brain in the crank-out mode and
finishing before daybreak. But I've yet
to learn the tricks of the paper-writing
profession.


Earlier this evening I'd been ahead
of the game. I'd read the book. I'd even
taken notes. I thought I had the best
topic for my paper on the Iliad-
"Patroklos: An Ancient Greek Christ
Figure." I liked the title for its import.
It reminded me of a friend's prize-
winning paper, "Nietzsche's On the
Genealogy of Morals: Catachresis and the
Value-Positing Eye." It pays to use colons.


Only after I had written three and a
half pages did I realize that Patroklos
lived 850 years before Christ.


At nine I realized that my paper
would fall flat if I didn't find the Oxford
English
Dictionary etymology of
all the words in my title. In Sterling I
found Beth Teare, Davenport '85, jot-
ting down numbers in the margin of
her copy of Rimbaud. She was calcu-
lating how far she had to write tonight:
"A five-page paper, at 24 lines a page,
seven and a half inches per line, would
be as long as the hall from the circula-
tion desk to the High Street exit. I can
write that far!"


We celebrated this fact with a study-
break in Machine City: Archetype of
Intellectual
Alienation
in
Modern
Society. We ran into a group of friends
who offered to write our papers for us,
each person composing one paragraph.
I'd heard of someone who succumbed
to this temptation last year when
writing her term paper for a credit/fail
course. She failed.


I
wished my friends luck and
prepared for the arduous transition
back to work by reading the bulletin
boards by the staircase. You never
know when information here can come
in handy. You never know when you'll
feel an overwhelming urge for sitar
lessons or when you'll be looking for a
good lecture on Conspiracy and Sup-
pression
in Eighteenth Century
Hoboken.



One page later I realized I
needed to go home for a dab
of Blistex beneath my
eyelids. (The menthol keeps
them open.)


Back up to the Main Reading Room
in search of any familiar face, anyone
to help me with Homer. "Learn from
people, not books," said Benjamin
Franklin. Or was it Aristotle? Bartlett's
Quotations (PN 6081 B37 1980, last
shelf on the right) says, "Draw from
others the lesson that may profit
yourself"- Heauton Timoroumenos,
the same guy who said, "Moderation in
all things." He never pulled an all-
nighter. He never spent 20 minutes
reading Bartlett's Quotations.


"May I have your attention please?"
No. "The circulation desk is now
closed. The library will close in 15
minutes." I had an outline by that
time, though it looked more like a
physics problem set, vectors every-
where. I stopped at Store 24, where 10
p.m. and 4 a.m. are gloriously similar,
demanded "Coffee! No sugar! No
cup!" and headed for the Morse
library.


One page later I realized I needed to
go home for a dab of Blistex beneath
my eyelids. (The menthol keeps them
open.) I tried to pick up my backpack
from under the table, but it wouldn't
move. Someone's head was resting on
it.


"What are you doing under the table
in the foetal position?"
"Sleeping," said the owner of the
head. "There are fewer drafts under
here. Going back to my room would be
admitting defeat."


I didn't care. I went back anyway
and cleaned my desk again. Cleaned
under my nails. Painted them with
White-Out. Waited for them to dry.
Flossed my teeth.


Blaise Pabon, JE '85, once told me
how he cured himself of fidgeting. "I
made my friend handcuff me to my
desk and leave the key. I told him
he couldn't let me loose till my paper
was done," he recalled. What if he had
to go to the bathroom during his con-
finement? "I guess I didn't give it much
thought," he said


But now it says 3:28 on my alarm
clock, and my mind is running on
automatic pilot. It's clearly time for the
Generic Paper. I pick several nouns,
verbs and adjectives and start writing
sentences: synthesis, coheres, infra-
structure, Keynesian, dichotomy, con-
notations,
conflate,
Hegelian, jux-
taposition, Hobbes (often typed "Gob-
bes" at this hour), clearly and in con-
clusion. One sees that the problema-
tical effort inherent in producing a text
by this method is at best formidable.


When this doesn't work, I start
moaning. "Sing in me, Muse, and
through me tell the story of . . . " No
luck. "Or Man's First Disobedience,
Sing, Heavenly Muse?" It worked for
Milton. "One's Self I sing, a simple
desperate person." Silence. "Descend
from heaven, bitch!"


After a similar plea, a friend of mine
once felt a poem approaching with the
sunrise:

My paper is due tomorrow
My blood flows black
Like coffee
And my mind races
In reverse
My thoughts swirl above
The Old Campus
