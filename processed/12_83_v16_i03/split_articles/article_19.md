Basketball Bounces Back 
The last time the Ivy League basketball 
trophy spent the winter in New Haven, 
John F. Kennedy was President and 
john Glenn was preparing for his space 
mission. Women weren't attending Yale 
College in those days, and most of the 
players on this year's basketball team 
weren't even born. That was 22 years 
ago. 

But 1984 may be different. Many 
basketball writers- including those at 
USA Today, Ivy Sports journal and the 
NCAA News-think that Yale will take 
the Ivy championship. The team is big-
ger and more talented than ever before. 
Six players are 
6'6~ or taller, and 
freshman center Ricky Ewing, who 
stands 6' 11 ", is the tallest player in the 
history of Yale basketball. Yale senior 
Butch Graves has scored more points 
in the last two seasons than any other 
player in the Ivy League. After the 
worst Yale football season in 111 
years- and after the poorest fall sports 
showing in decades- the athletic 
department may be looking toward the 
basketball team for redemption this 
winter. 

Basketball? Yale hasn't been to a na-
tional basketball playoff since 1962. 
And for that matter, basketball has 
never figured very prominently in the 
scheme of Yale athletics. Football has 
always 
reigned at 
Yale. 
Modern 
American football started here, and 
hardly a student passes through the 
university who doesn't at least once 
make the pilgrimage to the Yale Bowl, 
walk through the columnar monument 
to Walter Camp and hail the modern 
Frank Merriwell. Yet few students walk 
to Payne Whitney to see the basketball 
team. For most, basketball separates 
one football season from the next. The 
1984 team may change all that. 

A few weeks ago, Yale head basket-
ball coach Tom Brennan stood in an 
empty Payne Whitney amphitheater. 
He turned his head slowly, taking in all 
the unfilled seats, 3100 of them. Then 
he gazed at a darkened scoreboard. "I 
want this place to be a pit," he said. He 
pressed his fist into the palm of his op-
posite hand and clenched them into a 
single mass. "I just can't wait for the first 
time we get a screaming crowd in here, 
sell this place out."

Tom Brennan has aspirations for this 
squad. "I would consider myself a suc-
cess if we win an Ivy title," said Bren-
nan. "Coach Brennan is an all or 
nothing coach," said Bill jacob, one of 
six seniors on this year's team. "He 
wants us to make the NCAA tourna-
ment. He can't be satisfied with third. 
Coach Brennan is confident and cocky 
but he's as good at what he does as Vin-
cent Scully and Donald Kagan are at 
what they do." 

Tom Brennan, 33, is a tall, thin 
Irishman with straight brown hair 
parted neatly on the left and dark eyes 
that sink into an elongated face. His 
favorite outfit is a blue blazer with tan 
pants and a 
white, 
Oxford cloth 
button-down shirt. He knots his blue 
linen tie with a half windsor. "Coach 
Brennan always wears a coat and tie," 
said team captain Butch Graves: "That 
gives the program a look of class, pro-
fessionalism." 

Brennan came to Yale in July 1982. 
His arrival was the result of an "ex-
haustive search" by the Yale Athletic 
Department. Ninety other applicants 
vied for the job, but Yale athletic direc-
tor Frank Ryan settled on Brennan. 
Before coming to New Haven, he spent 
five years as an assistant coach at 
William and Mary. He also coached at 
Villanova, Fairleigh Dickinson, and 
Seton Hall. 

Tom Brennan grew up in Phillips-
burg, New Jersey, a small, blue-collar 
town on the New Jersey-Pennsylvania 
border. He is the classic local-boy-
made-good. In high school, he was a 
basketball star at Phillipsburg Catholic 
Academy. He scored more points than 
any other player in the school's history, 
and he won a basketball scholarship to 
the University of Georgia. 

His college playing was adequate, 
but by no means outstanding. He did 
win the Georgia Leadership Award for 
Basketball as a senior, but what people 
remembered about Brennan was his ag-
gressiveness. He recalled the day he had 
to guard LSU's Pete Maravkh, the 
NCAA all-time leading scorer. "I was 
determined to stay all over him," said

Brennan. And he did. He even followed 
him into the LSU huddle during a time-
out. 

Brennan's first task as head coach was 
to h ire assistants. He got M ike M ucci 
from Robert Morris College in August 
1982 and then picked Steve Yarnell 
from Cornell a month later. 

Yarnell is a short man with neatly 
combed, jet black hair and a hard, lined 
face. He comes to practice every after-
noon dressed in uniform: a dark blue 
Champion sweatshirt and metallic blue 
slacks with perfect creases that drape 
across the laces of his leather Nikes. H is 
nickname is Sarge. 

"Sarge is a great X and 0 guy," said 
Brennan. "He really knows basketball. 
He's very intense." At practices Yarnell 
controls Yale's defensive alignment. For 
five minutes every day, he runs a foot-
work drill. "Face me," he yelled. 
"Retreat. 
Retreat. 
Advance. · Shot. 
That's too 
slow. 
Again. 
R etreat. 
Retreat. Swing. Advance. Swing. Ad-
vance. You're too slow." Sarge stops the 
whole drill when one play is out of step. 

Mike Mucci hardly says a word at 
practice. "He's the most organized and 
sincere person I know," said Brennan. 
"Every staff needs a Mike Mucci. A lot 
of times after Sarge rips a guy, Mucci is 
over there patting him on the back. I 
like using them both at practice. I adapt 
myself to the staff. You can't be afraid to 
utilize people. But I'm still the guy in 
charge." 

Brennan had only been in charge for 
two months when he first met his 
players. Because he was hired in July, 
he had no chance to recruit before the 
1982-83 season. T here were 11 return-
ing players, but none were taller than 
6'7". 

But Brennan was undaunted. He set 
out to change the Yale image, and that 
meant changing Yale's style on the 
court. He junked the slow, methodical 
game- which former head coach Ray 
Carazo had favored- for a faster, more 
open one. Carazo's teams had been 
basketball craftsmen, following a low-
risk game plan calculated to set up the 
easy shots. Brennan's teams would be 
workers, perpetually in motion and car-
rying out their tasks at a ruthless pace. 

''Coach 
Brennan 
was 
an 
ideal 
choice," said Jacob. "The program 
needed someone to combat the stagna-
tion." 

Off the court Brennan is an executive: 
he devises strategies and he implements 
them. But at games, he is different. 
Brennan stalks from the center line to 
the end of the court, screaming at his 
players, orchestrating the crowd's cheer-
ing, and badgering the officials. H is 
arms swing, and his head cocks in dif-
ferent directions. "C'mon Butch, right 
side. Attaboy." A few Yale baskets, and 
Brennan is rolling. His legs are nimble, 
and he runs with his players. A referee's 
whistle that breaks the flow sends him 
jerking in disgust. his arms swing in cir-
cular motions. many reporters at the 
courtside press row have come perilous-
ly close to Brennan's right hook. 

The reporters have also learned to 
watch out for Brennan's coke. Every 
game Brennan drinks two or three 
16-ounce cokes; but he rarely ever 
finished 
them. 
He finishes 
about 
12 ounces and then sets the cup down 
on the press table next to the bench. But 
the first time a call goes against Yale, 
Brennan slams his fist on the table and 
splashes the remaining four ounces in 
every direction. Tl}e reporters pull ou t 
their handkerchiefs, dab their papers 
and suits, and return their phone 
receivers to the hooks. It happens every 
game. 

"I'm strange as a coach," said Bren-
nan. "The people and the situations are 
what make basketball exciting for me. 
Sometimes I wonder if I'm competitive 
enough. Basketball should be a fun ex-
perience. I'm never gonna take it 
seriously. 

"I think I'm gonna last in this 
business because winning is euphoric," 
said Brennan, "and losing I can take. 
Losing bothers me for that evening. It 
hurts when you put forth the effort we 
do, and it's not rewarded. It really 
hurts. Last year after we lost a game in 
Florida, I cried in the locker room. I 
cried like a baby. I felt our guys had put 
out the effort and had been ch eated by 
some bad ofTJ.ciating. But I shake it off. 
Coaching doesn't scare me. I'm not 
afraid to lose it. Even though I do it for 
a living, it's a part of me, not the 
whole." 

The other part of Brennan's life is his 
family. "One thing that concerns me 
about coaching," he said, "is the effect it 
has on my children. I don't ever want 
them to think that I'm going to Jose my 
job because the team lost. I don't want 
that kind of pressure on them. They 
shouldn't hM¥e to be objective. T hey 
should just want to win. I've never 
outgrown that myself." 

"We're 
his second 
family," 
said 
Graves. "He never tu rns his back on us. 
He makes 
people 
feel 
wanted. 
I 
remember we were having a tailgate out 
at the Bowl last year. It was after the 
first game Yale had won. This group of 
retarded kids came by, and one of them 
was screaming 'Yale, Yale.' Coach Bren-
nan called out to this kid: 'Hey, do you 
love Yale?' And the kid yelled : 'Yeah, I 
love Yale.' Coach 
took 
off the Yale sweatshirt he was wearing 
and handed it to the kid. H e said, 'If 


--- Page 39 ---

you love Yale, you keep this. This is 
yours, buddy.' I never saw a happier 
kid. He was clutching that sweatshirt 
like a million dollars. It was freezing 
out, but Coach Brennan didn't care. If 
it made someone's life happier, he 
would do it." 

Despite Yale's third place finish in the 
Ivy League, Brennan did not coach a 
winn ing team. He has never coached a 
winning team. Yale won 12 and lost 14 
last year; even Ray Carazo's 13-13 
mark in 1981-82 was better. Why all the 
hoopla over a losing team? 

"So much is confidence," said junior 
forward J eb Boasberg. "We really feel 
Coach Brennan's confidence in us." 

"H e's gotten us over the biggest 
hump," added Chris Kelly, another 
junior forward. "We know we can win 
the Ivy cham pionship." 

Brennan has also done some off-
season work to strengthen this Yale 
team. He brought in five high school 
stars to shore up Yale's short front line. 
Three of Brennan's recruits stand 6'8" 
or taller. 

Center Ricky Ewing was Brennan's 
biggest catch. Ewing was a standout 
performer at the University School in 
Nashville, and was wooed by big 
basketball schools like Virginia and 
Georgetown. But Ewing passed over 
their scholarship offers for four years at 
Yale. "I most definitely would not have 
e here if I didn't like the ~~~~~~W~h~a~
t ~c;a~n~~~~ ;.;_..-______________ 
_;_~~~~!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!~~!!!!!' 

Coaching doesn't scare me. 
I'm not afraid to lose it. Even 
though I do it for a living, it's 
a part of me, not the whole." 
Chris Ryan/The New Journal 

Ewing said. "When Coach Brennan 
came to visit me, he was very honest. 
He told me that there was no guarantee 
that I would get into Yale. He said he 
thought I had great potential and that I 
needed to look at Yale more closely and 
that with hard work and time I could 
play very well for Yale. John Thompson 
(Georgetown's head coach) caught me 
off guard. The first thing he said to me 
was 'I want to win an NCAA title. 

After that visit Brennan left Ewing to 
Mike Mucci. "Coach Mucci was a lot 
easier to talk to than other coaches," 
Ewing recalled. "He d id not appear to 
be overly confident. H e recruited me at 
his own pace. H e showed me what the 
Yale program had to offer and what 
Yale University had. T here was no 
pressure. I got too much pressure from 
a lot of other schools." 

Recruiting is often where champion-
ships are won and lost. Coaches must 
not only sell the school to the player but 
also to his parents. Brennan has his own 
lines to sell recruits on Yale. "You start 
with an advantage," he said. "When 
you're from Yale, you're going in with a 
Cadillac, not a lemon. I tell guys about 
what a challenge it is to build a win ning 
tradition here. And I tell them we have 
a great university, but that nobody 
rides for free. I tell them it's not easy. I 
lay out my credibility. I don't try to 
paint a rosy picture." 

Yet for the first time in two decades, 
the Yale basketball outlook is rosy. It's 
an outlook Brennan relishes: "People 
live to be in the situation we're in. 
W hen they all come to the gym for a b ig 
game, why do they come? Because 
they'd all like to be playing. I'd like to be 
in this situation all the time. R ight now, 
we're having a ball."
