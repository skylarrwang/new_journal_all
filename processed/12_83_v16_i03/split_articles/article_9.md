Two thousand and seventy-five couples 
were married, including Shiner. But he 
shakes his head at the idea that the 
ceremony was impersonal. "It was a 
communal event. It made my life a part 
of the social fabric." Like those of many 
church members, Shiner's marriage was 
arranged, though he sees nothing odd 
about that. Maybe he has some prob-
lems, but "isn't it better than being in 
love first and having problems later?" 


This is especially true of Unifica-
tionism, which considers marriage to be 
an unbreakable pact in this life as well 
as in whatever comes next . 


The Moonie mass ntarriage has done 
more than merely provoke controversy. 
It has also changed the demography of 
the entire movement. Several years 
ago, the Moonies were almost all young 
singles. Now they consist of families 
with children. Shiner looks forward to 
finishing his studies so that he too can 
begin a family. Until then, his wife will 
live in Washington; she is a reporter for 
the Washin.l!lon Timts, one of Reverend 
Moon's newspapers. They see each 
other on weekends. Does he mind? Not 
particularly. "Everything at its proper 
time," he says. 


Shiner's voice again inflects with en-
thusiasm when he talks about Reverend 
Moon's purchase of the Washin.t:Lon 
Times and the New York Tribune. H e pa-
tiently explains that the United States 
press, like so many other American in-
stitutions, is corrupt. Stirring the ice in 
his coke with his straw, he shakes his 
head at the skeptics. "We own the 
paper- we don't manipulate the news. 
Sure the Tinus is a conservative voice. 
But we end up in that camp because we 
believe in family values and fighting the 
Communist threat, not because of some 
conspiracy." 


Nor does Shiner have any qualms 
about Moon's other business and finan-
Cial connections. He explains with 
painstaking care how Moon plans to use 
his fishing interests to alleviate world 
hunger, his machine factories to aid 
• Third World economies. No one has 
ever proven any allegations of corrup-
tion against Moon, and his indictment 
for tax evasion is being appealed by a 
Harvard constitutional law expert and 
contested by the National Council of 
Churches, who certainly has no great 
love for Reverend Moon. 


Shiner finishes his coke, runs his 
hand through his neat blonde hair. The 
jukebox begins to blare, and Shiner's 
voice again becomes submerged be-
neath the laughter coming from the ad-
jacent booth. Very quietly, he offers his 
optimism for the future. "We live in a 
world of practical 
demands, and 
Moon's money is needed to feed people, 
to teach them. With America's wealth, 
we can achieve world peace and har-
mony. I believe it can be a reality."

Even now, a tinge of resentment creeps 
into Jack Hasegawa's voice when he 
remembers his first contact with the 
Moonies. H asegawa, the head of Yale's 
Dwight Hall, has a decidedly unen-
thusiastic recollection 
of their ap-
pearance in Japan nine years ago .. 
"They all wore matchin~ blazers, and 
rode through downtown Kyoto broad-
casting tapes cut by professional radio 
announcers. The streets were flooded 
with representatives, all excited, all 
anxious to convince us that there were 
no alternatives." 


In 1975, Hasegawa's daughter, then 
15, was approached by a friend of the 
family who had recently converted to 
Unificationism. The friend often waited 
for 
Hasegawa's daughter to 
walk 
home from school, and insisted on call-
ing the Hasegawa house many times. 
"We felt very much invaded. I think 
they tried to get at her through her 
Korean origins and her discomfort with 
the newness of the Japanese culture." 


He pauses. "You know, my dau~hter is 
a very soft-spoken woman. But 
la~t 
summer, we were 
\\alkm~ in New 
Haven, and a Moonie put her hand on 
my son's arm. My daughter snatched 
him away, and said 'I am a Korean, 
and I am ashamed of what vou arc do-
ing.' I have rarely seen her react that 
stron~ly to anythin~.~ 


At the time of his daughter's ex-
perience, 
Hasc~awa began 
investi-
gating some of Moon's other activities. 
He was struck by the complexity of 
Moon's financial network, and by 
allegations that Moon's fac;torics were 
no less exploitative than the sw1.:atshops 
run by capitalist interests. It sc:emed as 
if each new discovery about the Unifica-
tion Church reinforced all of his earlier 
susp1c1ons. 


H is 
inYolvement 
with 
C hristian social reform movements in 
Japan, which at that time suffered a 
degree of persecution from the Japanese 
government, opened his eyes to the 
possibility of even 
wider scandal. 


Speaking quite clearly, 
he recalls, 
"There was one building in Kyoto 
where various Christian groups had of-
fices. All at once, we were expelled. The 
offices were given to the Moonies. We 
thought it might have had something to 
do with Moon's alleged connections to 
the South Korean government." 


Hasegawa continues: "It all seems so 
paranoid now." He is smiling, but when 
he speaks it becomes apparent that if he 
is not now afraid of the Moonies, he 
certainly was in the past. "Granted the 
organization 
has perhaps changed. 
Perhaps they made mistakes." Just 
before Hasegawa came to Yale, the 
Moonies had actually been forbidden 
the use of Dwight Hall for mislabelling 
' . 
a lecture which turned out to be a 
recruiting meeting. Since then, they 
have openly asked for the hall on several•• 
occasions, and have been given permis· 
sion to use it. 


Others have noticed the Moonies' ap-
parant change in tactics. "They seem to 
have learned to give people room," ac-
cording to John Vannorsdall, Yale's 
chaplain. He notes that the Moonies 
now have all of the trappings of institu-
tionalized 
religion, 
including a 
seminary, a cohesive theology and 
members studying at institutions like 
Yale. "How do you judge legitimacy?" 
he asks, adding that neither he nor any 
other Yale minister has recently had any 
contact with the Unification in an 
adverse way. 


But Hasagawa scoffs at the Moonies' 
claim that they exist primarily to help 
other peop~. "As head of Dwight Hall, 
I come into contact with about 70 or 80 
charitable organizations. We don't see 
the Moonies. If they have all that 
money, where are they?"

The Chapel Street video center echoes 
with a myriad of accents. This is where 
the New Haven Moonie missionaries 
have their headquarters. The most im· 
portant part of Moonie religious activi-
ty takes place here. A short, thin man 
opens the door. In a thick Scottish ac· 
cent, he introduces himself as Frank 
and offers to explain the Moonie 
theology. 


Frank points 
to the video tape 
machines and the chairs in one room 
where lectures arc given every week. 
"Here is where you can learn. If 
everyone loved God, if everyone ex-
pressed God's love in his personal life as 
Reverend 
Moon 
does, 
we 
could 
realize paradise on earth ." Frank looks 
at his guest intently. "God is not a hap-
py G od. By being ignored or laughed at 
by people when you arc witnessing, you 
learn how God must feel." 


Frank shows the way into a very 
small room, containing nothing but two 
chairs, a low table and a television set. 
He opens his briefcase, and without idle 
rhauc-r begins to explain M oonie theol-
ogy. H e gets out a piece of paper, and 
draws Adam, Ev(', the snake and the 
apple. as well as a whole series of otht•r 
symbols: the same ones you might st•e 
on a blackboard on Cross Campus. 


Speaking quickly and earnestly, he 
shows how these symbols reveal the im-
portam·e of a moral family life, the 
possibility of peace on ear1h, and the 
way to live with God. "Basically, we're 
talking about the achievement of a 
unifiration of mind and body. which 
ran be achieved through moral it~ . " 


Evil, he explains, arises from improp<•r 
usc of God's gifts, from man tl]-ing w 
grow too quickly, to make judgmt•nts 
when still immature. Of course, "All is 
explained in the Divint Principlt. • 


Frank stops only to answet· a ft•w 
questions. "Do we have much success at 
Yale?" H t• appears somewhat puzzled. 
"Usually p<:ople here are too caught up 
in their own presuppositions. We have 
more c;u<·cess with blacks and Third 
\\'orld people who are more open-
minded ~ Frank immediatelv laum·hes 
into a fervent re-explanation of the 
Moonies' ?clief in morality, family. and 
anti-Com. nu nism. 


. Frank gt•ts up and says goodbye. He 
Js sorry he did not have time to com-
plete his t•xplanation. It is necessary to 
come back, to learn more. H e might 
not be: in Nt''-' Haven much lonl{er, but 
sorneont• is always here. If ,·ou «>Ill<'
