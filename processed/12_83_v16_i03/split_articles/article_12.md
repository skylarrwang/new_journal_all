**Title: Conservatism at Yale- The Old and the New**
**Author: Morris Panner**
**Page number(s): 21**

T
here has been much talk recently about the resurgence of conservative political 
thought on college campuses, and Yale has been no exception. What is the Yale 
Right? It is more than a few extremists on the fringe of social acceptability. Rather it is a 
growing political movement that uses the same techniques that liberals have successfully 
used in the past. 

In this issue we look first at the Party of the Right, the eccentric, high-brow debating 
society that generally disdains political activism. The article was written by an unlikely 
combination of people: 
David Bokman, a former chairman of the Liberal Party, and 
Bradford Berenson, a former recruiting director for the POR. 

In the second article we analyze a different kind of conservatism. The Yale College 
Republicans, the Yale Free Press and a handful of ideologues have begun to change the 
face of the Right at Yale. The author, TNJManaging Editor Morris Panner, spent the 
last two summers working in Washington, D.C. as a political fund-raiser for an array of 
H ouse and Â·senate candidates.
