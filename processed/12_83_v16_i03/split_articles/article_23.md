**Beating the Habit: Two New Approaches to Drug Dependency**
**Author: Tony Reese**
**Page number(s): 44-45**

Nestled among the many buildings of 
the Yale-New Haven Hospital complex 
is one of the most impressive drug 
rehabilitation clinics in the country. At 
the Substance Abuse Treatment Unit 
(SATU) of the Connecticut Mental 
Health Center, two Yale psychiatrists 
are revolutionizing drug abuse treat-
ment programs around the country 
with. 
innovative medications and 
counselling programs. Together, the 
two scientists who work here are chang-
ing the way the medical profession con-
fronts the problem of drug addiction. 

SATU's new programs aim to incor-
porate these advances into a compre-
hensive counselling and therapy pro-
gram for drug addicts. 

Early in 1976, Dr. Herben Kleber 
and his 
research team at SAT U 
pioneered the use of naltrexone, a non-
addictive classified as a narcotic an-
tagonist that blocks the euphoric effects 
of heroin and methadone. But even 
more important, when Kleber combin-
ed this drug with a common blood 
pressure medication known as doni-
dine, he found that he could reduce the 
detoxification ·process in addicts from 
over six months to as little as three days. 

While Kleber was doing his drug re-
search, Dr. Bruce Rounsaville was 
developing a new therapy that empha-
sizes the psyrhological as well as the 
physiological basis of drug addiction. In 
a major· study of 600 opiate addicts, 
completed in 1981, Rounsaville dis-
covered that many of them were at-
tempting to cure their own mental 
problems by taking drugs. "Addicts 
have a depression rate of two to three 
times that of the general public, an 
alcoholism rate of four to five times 
higher, and an occurrence of antisocial

behavior ten to 20 times the normal 
rate," explained Rounsaville. "These 
problems that occur above and beyond 
the addiction make it harder for a user 
to get over his addiction. They help to 
perpetuate it, and, in fact, may have led 
to it in the first place. These addicts 
may be using the drugs to treat them-
selves." 

Rounsaville's research points to the 
need for a two-pronged approach to 
drug addiction. "The approach that 
drug abuse should be treated first is still 
valid," he said. "But the idea that if you 
treat the addiction everything else will 
fall into place is inadequate. The prob-
lems inherent in addiction such as get-
ting access to the drug and raising the 
$200 a day to support the habit may 
disappear, but the psychological prob-
lems remain to be treated. Thus, they 
·are more likely to relapse into dnJg use. 
"We have to see addicts as a hetero-
geneous group of people according to 
their psychological characteristics and 
the path that led to their addiction if 
we're going to find the. most effective 
types of treatment." 

Although Rounsaville's work sug-
gests a long-term program of rehabilita-
tion, Dr. 
Kleber's research in the 
clinical treatment unit has improved 
detoxification programs, which are a 
prerequisite to any further treatment. 

Kleber's work rests on the principle 
that an addict must gradually be 
weaned from the harder drug to a 
milder substitute which is easier to give 
up, such as methadone. "Methadone is 
a narcotic just like heroin," 
Kleber 
said. "Its advantage is that it can be 
taken orally rather than intravenously; 
it can be taken less frequently than the 
three or four times a day for heroin; and 
it doesn't cause euphoria when taken 
orally . 
Like 
heroin, 
however, 
methadone is an addicting narcotic. 
Many addicts who enter methadone 
programs to stop their heroin addiction 
have considerable trouble stopping their 
~ 
methadone use." 

But naltrexone, which has been the 
primary focus of Kleber's research, has 
all the advantages of methadone, and 
it's non-addictive. Once detoxified, the 
addict 
has · no difficulty stopping 
naltrexone use. 
Naltrexone attaches 
itself to the nerve receptor sites normal-
ly affected by narcotics, preventing the 
narcotics from acting on the nervous 
system. Like methadone, it is an oral 
medication that 
does 
not 
induce 
euphoria. Also, it requires only one 
dose every three days rather than once a 
d(ly, like methadone. 

"Naltrexone comes from the poppy-
it's sort of like the 'hair of the dog that 
bit you,'" explained Kleber. "Nature 
often provides both a drug and its an-
tagonist in the same plant. Cannabis, 
for example, contains both THC and 
anti-THC, and the 'quality' of any 
given marijuana is a function of how 
much of each it contains." 

Paradoxically, naltrexone's greatest 
strength is also its greatest weakness. 
Because it is non-addictive, there is no 
incentive for the addict to keep using it. 
With methadone, if an addict misses a 
dose, he enters withdrawal just as if he 
has missed a dose of heroin. With nal-
trexone, an addict not only has no 
adverse reaction to missing a dose; but 
since the nerve receptors are no longer 
blocked, he can also use narcotics again 
to produce euphoria. "The problem," 
said Kleber, "is 'how to keep 'em down 
on the farm after they've seen Paree.'" 

Also, because it is not addicting, 
naltrexone forces the addict to go 
through an instant and painful with-
drawal as soon as he stops taking 
methadone or heroine. To ease the 
withdrawal, Kleber has begun using 
naltrexone with clonidine. Clonidine 
had been on the market for a number of 
years as a blood pressure medicine 
when in 1978 Kleber discovered that it 
also blocked opiate withdrawal symp-
toms. "We're still refining the tech-
niques of its use-dotting the 'i's' and 
crossmg the 't's'. But the use of clonidine 
has spread across the country." Kleber 
has begun testing the drugs at SATU in 
an outpatient program that is three 
months old and has five patients par-
ticipating. 

months and was accomplished by a 
somewhat haphazard reduction in 
methadone dosage," Kleber explained. 
"With donidine, we could detoxify 
someone in two weeks. And, now with 
the combination of donidine and nal-
trexone, we can do it in as little as 72 
hours. The use of clonidine was a quan-
tum leap in treatment, and so was the 
discovery of donidine and naltrexone 
together." 

Kleber discovered that if he com-
bined some of Rounsaville's counselling 
methods 
he 
could 
overcome 
naltrexone's weakness. Kleber and his 
colleagues have found that a program of 
multiple 
family therapy- a 
group 
therapy session with several families 
participating- is the most effective way 
to keep addicts in the program. Three 
years ago, Kleber kept approximately 
30 percent of his patients in the pro-
gram with a combination of counselling 
and medication. "Now, with more ad-
vanced counselllng techniques, we're up 
to between 50 and 60 percent retention 
at six months in the naltrexone program 
in conjunction with family therapy," 
·said Kleber. 

"We're not satisfied with just what 
we've got, and we pay constant atten-
tion to asking questions," explained 
Kleber. "Naltrexone is just a drug, not a 
treatment." Kleber, like his colleague 
Rounsaville, emphasizes the com-
prehensive nature of drug treatment 
programs. "We need to provide a 
panoply of psychological, psychosocial 
and vocational support in conjunction 
with any drug treatments to have suc-
cess."
