4:02. The Cerebellum-Vellum At-
traction Syndrome sets in. The wood 
from .ny desk sends ou t magnetic rays 
to my brain. Everything starts to look 
two-dimensional. I have rapid eye 
movem<'nt with my eyes open. 
I wake to the screeches of the gar· 
bagt' trucks on York Street, stumble in· 
to the bathroom and notice that I am 
COVered with snarf marks, those red 
streaks you get on your face when 
>:ou do;.e with your clothes on, par· 
tlcularly intriguing when you sleep on 
Y0~Jr arm while wearing a fisherman· 
kntt sweater. I look like modern art. 
Try scrubbing them, soaking them, 
and you still have . . . 
.• I go take a real nap. I Jay my paper 
far away from the open window shud· 
dering as I remember what ha~pened 
to Peter Neitlich, Morse '85. "One 
morning two years ago I left my 
12-page paper on my desk in front of 
an open window," he remembered with 
...

"It was futile. I was contem· 
plating some serious squirrel 
murder." 
an apocryphal smile, and all of a sudden 
I heard a squeaking noise on my 
desk, and the next thing I know, the 
paper's going out the window in the 
mouth of this squirrel." H e tried to 
lean out and grab the paper, which was 
due that morning. "It was futile. I was 
contemplating some serious squirrel 
murder. I thought I was doomed, but 
believe it or not, my T.A. gave me an 
extension. For several days after that I 
kept looking around for the paper, but 
all I ever found was a gnarled and 
gnawed page nine." 
At least he'd had a finished product. 
The only page I'm satisfied with now is 
the title sheet, which I typed yesterday 
at five. I walk down to the dining hall 
for consolation. 
Breakfast the morning a fter is never 
pleasant. I sit down with the seven 
dwarfs: Grumpy, Sleepy, Snoozy, 
Sneezy, 
Bleary, 
Wea r y 
and 
Thucydides. Thucydides takes inten-
sive G reek. H e is the last of the big-
time overachievers. 
He carries 
a 
monogrammed Cross pen 
in the 
pocket of his crisply-ironed shirt. His 
' 
watch beeps every 15 minutes and runs 
fast so he is never late. He measures 
out the sugar for his tea. H e levels it ofT 
with his butter knife. "Son of a gun," 
he lisps, "I do hope my typist has my 
paper ready. After all, I gave it to her 
Wednesday. I need time to get___it 
xeroxed." Grumpy throws an ice cube 
and nails him squarely on the skull. It 
bounces ofT with a dull thud. 
Ten minutes till D·day, and I have 
only one page to go. It's time to put on 
Springsteen real loud. "Born to Run" is 
inspiration for the sprint to the box in 
Linsly Chit. It may be a good sign that 
rm still writing because
