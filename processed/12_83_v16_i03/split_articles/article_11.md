EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
AIDS-carrying prostitute, is diverting 
attention from the real problems. "That 
woman, if she exists, deserves our 
respect and confidentiality," said 
Novick. "So I don't like to speak about 
her. But Keane says it is important to 
warn people. What is he going to warn 
them about? Since there is no cure, 
what you are doing is putting a tremen-
dous amount of stress on a large 
number of people who may never have 
been exposed. What are you offering 
them- two or three years of hysteria? 


Besides, why should we waste time and 
emotional energy talking about this case 
when the overwhelming majority of the 
victims are gay men?" 

Keane, on the other hand, considers 
Novick's priorities to be misplaced and 
asserts that AIDS threatens the general 
public far more than Novick is willing 
to admit. "My concern is two-sided. 
First, I'm concerned about her welfare. 
I have heard from people in the com-
munity that this woman is being har-
~assed. This kind of thing puts her life 
an jeopardy. Some rival pimp could 
think that she is endangering business 
and could just make her disappear. My 
other concern is for the public, and par-
ticularly people who go to prostitutes. I 
know perfectly respectable people who 
do. I think it is shooting dirty pool not 
to alert men who frequent prostitutes." 

And, Keane strongly emphasizes that 
the last thing he wants is to have Lana 
quarantined or put in jail. If anyone 
were to arrest her, Keane says, he 
would be the first person to find her an 
attorney. But he believes that some-
thing should be done now. "Concerned 
• individuals ought to raise money so this 
woman can go on a prolonged vacation 
from the streets, with drug counsellors 
supervising her until a test can be for-
mulated that adequately determines 
whether she has AIDS. Can't society af-
ford that?" 

Keane himself has made several at-
tempts to raise money. He has written a 
letter to Tlu Yale Alumni Magazine in 
which he seeks benefactors for Lana. 
Last week he and Yale Chaplain John 
Vannorsdall scheduled a visit with Lana 
on her last morning at the hospital to 
discuss raising funds, but found that she 
had checked out early without explana-
tion. Keane also wrote President A. 
Bartlett Giamatti two letters in August 
warning him about the potential risks to 
the community and asking him to exert 
his "moral authority" to help Lana out 
of her predicament. "I propose that we 
(under your leadership) 
raise 
money from individuals, institutions 
and government agencies to pay this 
woman to stay off the streets," wrote 
Keane. "You are shepherd of a huge in-
stitution whose population contains 
hundreds of persons in the high risk 
categories for AIDS. You don't want a 
life-threatening disease thundering 
through your campus." 

Giamatti's response to Keane's re-
quest came in the words of Lindsey 
Kiang, the President's legal counsel. 
"We're looking at an issue that is beyond 
our control," Kiang argued. "It is out of 
our jurisdiction to handle the case of 
this woman. It is the responsibility of 
the Health Department to deal with this 
sort of thing. We have to assume that 
our public health officials are doing 
their job. Yale students, like any other 
adults, have to be responsible for their 
own actions. What is the University go-
ing to do, put up signs with photo-
graphs around campus warning that 
this person has AIDS? For Yale Univer-
sity to step in and get involved in this 
case would not only be an invasion of 
privacy; it would be an act of defiance 
against the state and would probably be 
unconstitutional." 

While Keane has found little solace in 
Yale's official position, he has also had 


little 
luck convincing the 
Health 
Department to rethink its policies on 
AIDS. The Department has neither the 
staff nor the funds to follow up on AIDS 
patients and locate their sexual contacts 
in the same way that it monitors syphilis 
cases. "I personally feel that we should do 
follow up work," admitted Stone. "But 
with the many illegal activities involved 
with AIDS- particularly the drug con-
nection- follow up would be a difficult 
and dangerous procedure. Obviously, 
we would have to work with the police. 

"Although the doctors assume that 
the prostitute will become stage three 
soon," continued Stone, "some people 
say they ought to lie and say that she 
has AIDS now rather than wait. If she 
became a verified AIDS case, I suppose 
we might be able to move on that infor-
mation." 

Yet until that time, Lana will remain 
on the streets, and all the questions 
about rights and risks will linger: What, 
if anything, should society do with a 
woman who is already involved in two 
illegal activities and who may be 
transmitting a deadly disease to people? 
Can the H ealth Department act on in-
complete medical evidence in a case like 
this? Or is it possible that frequenters of 
prostitutes have in a sense forfeited their 
right .to special public protection by 
willingly engaging in a criminal activity 
widely known to be associated with all 
sorts of communicable diseases? If one 
is prepared to single out prostitutes, 
then how long will it be before gay and 
bisexual men will also become targets in 
the public's cry for quarantine? By 
isolating one group, would the Health 
Department not be surrendering to the 
same alarmist attitudes and paranoia 
that it has been trying desperately to 
discourage in society?
