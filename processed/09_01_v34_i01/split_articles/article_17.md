I N Th( Story of jane, C ussET TELLS TH E TALE OF j ANE CooK, 
a young French professor at Devayne University, a prestigious 
institution on Long Island Sound with "the best French departmen t 
in the whole country." While Cusset does change proper names, the 
story's real-life setting becomes quickly apparent in light of Cusset's 
descriptions of Old Campus and the closing of Macy's off the Green 
in the early 1990~. And the name "Devayne University" conspicu-
ously echoes Yale~s. DeVane Lectures. 
Jane returns home one day to find an unsigned package wait-
ing at her door. Inside, she discovers a manuscript recounting her 
own life from the moment she started teaching at Devayne to the 
moment she picked up the package. From this point on, the book 
consists almost enrit:ely of the text of the manuscript. A picture of 
Jane's life within the university, and by extension the life of a Yale 
professor, emerges. 

This portrait is not a positive one for academics or anyone 
aspiring to the profession. The world inhabited by Devayne profes-
sors is competitive, unhappy, and, most of all, sexually frustrated. 
Nearly all the faculty ace getting divorced, having affairs, or living 
miserably alone, ofren all three simultaneously. Of the French 
department, Jane thinks, 
Poor them. All of them. Even those who had tenure at 
Devayne, this sign of highest achievement. T hey were 
like kids, arguing about trifles with terribly serious voic-
es. So little joy on their faces ... No wonder they were all 
desperately hanging on to the miserable little power left 
to them: torturing graduate students and refusing tenure 
to their young colleagues. 

One of Jane's friends explains to her, "This place makes you dry up 
inside like an old parchment and you lose your imagina~on and 
your senses. Not you especially, but anyone here ... One day you 
rnay buy one or two dogs too, and never leave Old Newport any-
more except for the M LA convention. Just like McGregor and 
Carrington: dead inside." 

Despite the bleak tone, the novel does provide Yale and New 
Haven-savvy readers a test of their geographic and gossip knowl-
edge. Sleuths can find a Naples-like pizza place, Connecticut Limo, 
and even AYA tours, which Jane describes as full of "eighty-five-year-
old men who were dripping saliva around her and who had all taken 
the Concorde to fly to Paris because it was barely more expensive 
and so much more convenient than a first-class ticket in a normal 
plane." The reader's game of assigning identities to the fictional pro-
fessors makes the book even more intriguing. Jane herself says, 
"Professors of literature these days wouldn't hesitat~ to sell their 
souls-or their colleagues' souls-just to get a few crumbs of Literary 
glory." As one reads Cusset's novel, one can't help but wonder 
whether this is exactly what Cusset has done. Her characters discuss 
their own attempts to fictionally adapt their lives, both portraying 
and commenting on her own Literary project. 

Overall, Cusset paints a salacious and depressing picture of 
American academia--one that no doubt greatly interested the 
French readers who first picked up the novel in I999Â· As the novel 
progresses, the literature professor in Cusset becomes more and 
more apparent, as she plays with the fine line between fiction and 
non-fiction. Those looking for a book true to Yale in every respect 
will be left scratching their heads and waiting for their brand-new 
history of the Provost's Office.
