embryos that she and her ex-husband had 
created and frozen a few years prior. A 
strange case for child custody lawyers. 

Ten years ago at the University of 
California Fertility Clinic, doctors took 
frozen embryos from successful patients 
and gave them to other couples without 
consent. Once discovered, the scam result-
ed in over a hundred prosecutions and a 
cohort of children whose biological parents 
didn't consent to their existence, and whose 
active parents, in legal terms, had stt>len 
them. The motivation for the doctors was 
money. And the parents simply wanted a 
baby. It is hard to say if throwing the 
embryos away would have been any better. 

Even if Michelle and David liked my 
stats, I knew I had. a long way to go before 
becoming an actual donor. The application 
on Egg Donors Inc. is 13 pages long-twice 
as long as Yale's entrance application. The 
first two pages cover the basics: looks, 
name, address. After that, they wanted to 
know if I'd ever filed for bankruptcy, ever 
had counseling, did I drink, what were my 
goals in life, tWO favorite books, my pater-
nal grandfather's height and weight, bob-
bies, what I would want the child to know 
about me, etc. They even threw in a few 
fill-in-the-blanks at the end: "I feel strong-
ly about_, I am sorry I did not __ , In 
ten years I want to be __ ." Not even my 
closest friends knew all these things about 
me. If Egg Donors Inc., offering less than 
one tenth of Michelle and David's com-
pensation, wanted all this information, 
who knows what data Michelle and David 
might want? 


H
I CHELLE AND DAVID were certainly 
trying hard. On one classified site, 
I carne across a request that was strangely 
familiar: "Loving family seeks exceptional 
egg donor with 1500 SAT, great looks, good 
family health history, Jewish heritage and 
athletic. Height 5'3"-5'9", 18-29. We will 
pay EXTREMELY well and will take care 
of all expenses. Hope to hear from you." 
The email address was David and 
Michelle's familiar AOL account. Theirs was 
the most demanding classified on the site, 
but also the only one that offered to pay 
"EXTREMELY well". 

I kept dreaming about all the things I 
could do with $5o,ooo. I had gone into the 
correspondence on a whim, the same way I 
sometimes buy a lottery ticket or enter a 
raffle. But soon, despite David's casual tone 
and the optimistic attitude of all the dassi-
fieds and information I read, I realized that 
this process was something of which I 
never wanted to be a part. I understand the 
desire for a child, even one who would 
resemble and fit in with the family. But 
once a couple starts choosing a few charac-
teristics, it is too easy to shoot for perfec-
tion, especially if you can afford it. The 
money might have changed my life for a 
while, but ultimately it would contribute 
to the creation of a life designed with too 
many expectations. 

After hours of thought I received the 
shortest email of the correspondence. The 
verdict on my pictures was in: "I showed 
the pies to my wife this AM. Personally I 
think you look great. She said Ho Hum." 
The email dosed with those two sim-
ple words. No goodbye,' no thanks for 
potentially having been the biological 
mother of their child. Nothing. I guess I 
didn't fit in their design; my genes weren't 
the right material for their chif d'orovre. So 
my eggs were rejected. I keep imagining the 
day when David and Michelle's child asks 
where he or she carne from. David will go 
off on a tangent about how hard they both 
worked on the whole thing. how much 
they spent, and how many pictures they 
looked at. The child will turn to them and 
say, "ho-hum."

Although Greene claims, "I don't care

a deeper resentment. 
"Race should not 
play a part in this ... everyone should be on 
a level playing Geld," he mused, "but it's 
not a level playing field." 

In light of the Lims' case, a variety of 
local leaders feel that city policies for devel-
oping Dixwell have seriously failed to rec-
oncile interests in community-based devel-
opment 
and 
economic 
soundness.

board's decision encouraged what he sees as 
"racism in its strictest form ... [the] denial 
of economic development." The Lims' 
lawyer Norbert Church argues that the case 
"is actionable ... [as there was] no legally 
sufficient reason" for denying their peti-
tion. The Lims' case highlights the difficul-
ty of arbitrating community interests and 
fiscal planning. It's likely that development 
for Dixwell will continue to mean invest-
ment from outside the community and 
dependency on those investors - unless the 
city comes forward with a more accessible 
process.

mistic. Bur come this fall, Dixwell Plaza 
will be empty for the seventh year in a row.
