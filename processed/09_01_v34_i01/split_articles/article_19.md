**Title: The Dying Animal**
**Author: Philip Roth**
**Page number(s): 26-27**

N
o one would accuse Philip Roth of 
avoiding the big questions in his 
twenty-odd novels. In The Dying Anima/, 
Roth brings .back David Kepesh, a horrify-
ing yet compelling character and the pro-
tagonist of two of Roth's previous books. 
Kepesh is an elderly professor of "practical 
criticism" who embraced the sexual revolu-
tion of the 1960s and remains totally com-
mitted to it despite his 62 years of age. He 
does delay his affairs with students until 
they have completed his course and he has 
turned in their grad~, a policy in place 
"since, back in the mid-eighties, the phone 
number of the sexual harassment hotline 
was first posted ourside [his] office door." 
The Dying Animal describes in first person 
Kepesh's own turbulent eight-year obses-
sion with a former student named 
Consuela, while also recounting many of 
his past exploits and describing the old 
man's torture of realizing that, 
all those body parts invisible up to 
now (kidneys, lungs, veins, arteries, 
brain, intestines, prostate, heart) are 
about to start making themselves 
distressingly apparent, while the 
organ most conspicuous through-
out your life is doomed to dwindle 
to insignificance. 

While Roth's ·professor is as lecherous 
as those in Cussers and Lodge's novels and 
may call to mind stories told around the 
courtyards of Yale, his book is the least 
concerned with academia per se. Instead, 
Roth chooses the character of a professor in 
order to chart the waters of contemporary 
sexual activity. Not only was Kepesh 
immersed in the energy of the 1960s as a 
student, but now as a professor he has more 
space to live by his own convictions than 
the professional world provides, as well as a 
continuing supply of liberated young 
women. 

In Kepesh, Roth conjures up a man 
driven by both an analytical mind and a 
carnal nature. While Kepesh is controlled 
by the basest desires, his understanding of 
the functioning of these urges borders on 
brilliance. Because Roth uses an academic 
setting chiefly to better convey non-acade-
mic questions such as those surrounding 
modern-day sex, his novel is the most com-
pelling of the three. Cusset and Lodge, as 
career academics, provide interesting 
images of the professorate and its peccadil-
loes, but Roth, a major literary figure, 
answers and asks questions that resonate 
OUtside of academia.
