opportunities to read about Yale. Last September, Tom Perona gave Yale under-
graduates a fictionalized account of their lives in Jo~ Co/kg~. Art History students can 
now purchase a guide to each and every stained glass window on Yale's campus. 
Professor John Hollander edited a volume of poems by Yale alumni inspired by 
paintings in the Yale University Art Gallery. Someone is even publishing an in-

American debut, an English translation of her fictionalized account of Yale's pro-
