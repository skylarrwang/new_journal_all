EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
EARLY LAST SPRING, a classified ad ran 
for rwo weeks in the Yale Daily 
N~s: Wanted: one egg. But this couldn't 
be just any egg. T he couple was picky, and, 
for that reason, was offering between 
$40,000 and $6o,ooo for the right egg 
from the right donor. 

I had a book as a child called "Where 
Did I Come From?" It offered a full bio-
logical explanation, in cartoons, of those 
sticky, awkward questions that curious 
tots ask. But the book is now out of 
date. Replacing it are books such as 
Mommy, Did I Grow In Your Tummy? 
The update "explains to children 
about all the ways babies can come 
into the world . . . it provides 
descriptions of egg donors, sur-
rogacy 
and 
adoption." 
When 
conception 
doesn't occur in the 
natural way, it 
becomes very 
complicated. 
Once all par-
ties have been 
accounted 
for-includ-
ing eggdonors, 
sperm donors, 
surrogate 
mothers, and the paying couple--five peo-
ple can be involved with the conception, 
carrying, delivery, and rearing of the child. 
No wonder there is a new book. 

The prospective parents' choice to 
advertise in the N~~and the five-figure 
compensation-immediately 
suggested 
that they were in the market for an egg of a 
certain standard. Their demands weren't for 
just any Ivy Leaguer. The specifications 
were as follows: over 5'7", preferably 
blonde, of Jewish heritage, athletic, and a 
minimum 1500 SAT score. I was curious, 
and I fit all the criteria except the SAT score. 
So I emailed Michelle and David and asked 
for more information about the process 
and how important the SAT minimum real-
ly was to them. From there, I launched into 
one of the strangest email relationships I've 
ever had. 

DONATING AN EGG is neither simple 
nor painless. The process takes a few 
weeks. First, the donor and the woman 
who will carry the child must coordinate 
their menstrual cycles. The donor takes 
birth control pills, followed by a shot of 
Depo-Lupron, to bring her cycle in synch 
with that of the surrogate. Synchrony can 
typically be achieved simply by having two 
women live together, but in the 
world of egg donation such low-tech, time-
intensive methods are frowned upon. 

After altering her cycle, the donor 
must enhance her egg supply with fertility 
drugs in the same way an infertile woman 
does when trying to conceive. Shots of a 
common fertility drug such as Follistim or 
Fertinex are administered for seven to 
eleven days to stimulate the release of an 
abnormally large number of egg-contain-
ing follicles. During this time, the donor 
must give blood every other day before 9AM 
so doctors can monitor hormone levels. 
Thirty-six hours before retrieyal day, a shot 
of HCG (profasi) is administered to prevent 
the eggs from being released on their own 
schedule before they are ready for pick-up. 
The actual retrieval happens while the 
donor is under anaesthetic. The tool is a 
needle and the product, with luck, is five to 
ten follicles. Egg Donation Inc., an "egg 
bank," explained that doctors take that 
many because "not every follicle will con-
tain an egg, and not all eggs will be good. 
Some will be immature and some over-
ripe." 

I later spoke with Sherry T, one of the 
founders of Surrogate Mothers Online, a 
two-time donor and also the mother of rwo 
of her "own" children. She 
found donating
