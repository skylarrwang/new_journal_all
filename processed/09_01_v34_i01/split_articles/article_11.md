~, 0 ne night in 1994, Angelo Reyes watched 
a gunfight play out only yards from the 
dilapidated house on Peck Alley that he had just bought 
and renovated for his family. A buller hole marks the sid-
ing as a reminder. "I was scared for my daughter," says 
Reyes. "I was aggravated." The next day, he dumped 
twelve tons of dirt in the alleyway, retained his new front 
yard with a wall of concrete blocks, and stretched a chain-
link fence across the other side. People objected. Drug deal-
ers cur through his fence. The city wanted him arrested. But 
Reyes was determined. "I fought with the people ... In the 
end, they just gave up, because I wasn't going to hear it. This 
was nor going to be a shooting gallery anymore ... I worked 
a little backwards. I worked from anger, and I just did it." 
Standing in his front yard, Reyes describes the first project 
he completed through a method he pioneered in Fair 
Haven, a poor Latino neighborhood in Ne-w Haven. "They 
call it 'Angelo Domain,"' he jokes. 


Reyes knows about working backwards. In a sense, 
he's been working backwards his whole life. A self-pro-
claimed "private developer," he operates a laundromat, 
purchases and renovates run-down houses, and origi-
nates loans for first-rime home buyers from his neigh-
borhood. Many of those buyers have bad credit or no 
credit at all when they come to him; they are the sort of 
people shunned by banks and mortgage brokers. "Angelo 
works at the margins: in a housing marker that people say 
doesn't work, with prospective homeowners who often have 
lousy credit, in a neighborhood that people say is impossible 
to get anything done in," says Paul Wessel, a Neighborhood 
Specialist for Fair Haven at New Haven's Livable City 
Initiative (LCI). What makes his work all the more striking is 
that Reyes began it while on supervised release from federal 
prison. 


In 1992, he was convicted of drug trafficking and conspiracy. 
The sale of one ounce of cocaine and his refusal to cooperate with 
federal prosecutors earned him 57 months behind bars. ''I'm a late 
bloomer," Reyes says, "but I'm here and I'm strong. I'm here in Fair 
Haven, and I see others who are late bloomers. I think I can help." 
He's working backwards still, and changing Fair Haven for the better. 
But he's doing it Fair Haven's way. 
THE NEW jouRNAL

day ofte, h~ :6ili binhday. Angelo Reye.< <old m• ru, ur. 
'l.story. By the time he turned nine, his family life was crum-
bling. His parents separated, and Reyes worked a number of jobs to 
help support his mother and siblings. "I grew up in a neighborhood 
... where you woke up to it that a little burglary doesn't hurt any-
one, that selling drugs is OK because you have to do what you have 
to do," Reyes says. By 13, he had turned to selling cocaine. With 
selling came using. Soon, though, the physical effects of addiction 
opened his eyes. "I started recognizing who I was, and it was ugly," 
Reyes says. "I tried to make change. I stopped partying when I was 
suddenly coughing up blood, when I couldn't smell anything 
because of my sinuses. I would still sell, though, and I'd be saying 
J\11 right, but this stuff will kill you.'" 


A federal sting operation finally nailed Reyes. A friend and fel-
low dealer from East Haven whom Reyes had regularly supplied was 
apprehended. The friend informed on him and conducted a deal 
with him while wearing a wiretap. Reyes spent nearly five years in 
prison. He now says, "It cost a lot of people--it cost my son," refer-
ring to his first child, fathered at age 19. "I am full of regret that I 
can't spend the moments. But I tell myself that this was a process 
for me to be whoever I am now. So I lost a few years to gain a life-
time." 


Despite his initial refusal to cooperate with prosecutors, Reyes 
proved to be a model prisoner, says Vicky Stackpole-Adams of the 
U.S. Federal Probation Office. Once, left behind at a worksite out-
side the prison grounds, Reyes made the choice to walk back to his 
cell. "[People I passed] were like, 'What the hell are you doing?' I 
was like 'I'm walking back to prison.' But I was comfortable with 
my sentence. I was comfortable that I had to do this and get it over 
with." 


Released under supervision, Reyes got a job and slowly began 
to rebuild his life. "Here I am, 36 years old, and I'm finally doing 
what I should have been doing at 13 ... It took me a while to look 
in that mirror and say 'You're Angelo Reyes, I forgive you, go on.'" 
lJ e has gone on, remapping Fair Haven in the process. 


P Buildings are razed, boundaries redrawn and properties 
seized, all by right of "Angelo Domain." I met up with Reyes 
for a tour of his projects. We begin at 291 Uoyd Street, a house that 
stands out on a sueet where the others look as if they could only be 
inhabited by squatters or illegal immigrants, both commoh in Fair 
Haven. Here, work trucks crowd the driveway. A black man covered 
in a patina of plaster dust and sweat peeks through the window 
when I arrive. "I picked it up for a good price," Reyes explains, 
referring to the house he purchased at a foreclosure auction. "I did-
n't even look in there. But there was this hustler, selling drugs, an, 
uh ... a poacher, no, what do you call it?" "A squatter?" I suggest.

"Yeah, a squatter ... Now, either I could go through the motions of 
the courthouse and yada yada, or I just say, 'Look, what do you 
need?' He told me $2,500 would get him out of there. I told him, 
'Twenty-five hundred dollars, and you don't get a dollar till you're 
out that door. And you can keep the locks.'" Inside, Reyes' work 
crew, composed of temporary workers from the neighborhood-
new immigrants, ex-cons, the disabled, and folks just down on their 
luck-are completing renovations. They redid the house from floor 
to ceiling, patching walls, reshaping rooms. Reyes plans to sell the 
place, at little profit to himself, to a 20-year-old woman with a child 
and a $400-a-week job--someone, he explains, whom every bank 
simply ignores. "But she just met a nice guy," he says, "and they 
want to take a chance. That's the type of people we need here." 


The other houses we visit are similar. At one on Exchange 
Street, Reyes split a neighboring abandoned lot with a stockade 
fence, claiming half for himself and half for the house next door. 
Both residents now enjoy backyards unusually spacious for Fair 
Haven. Another house, on Woolsey Street, was the first Reyes pur-
chased upon leaving prison. This was where he learned to work 
backwards. 


Reyes tells how he first learned the basics of buying and sel.ling 
houses in prison: not from any class, but from fellow inmates 
locked up for selling bad mortgages. As they detailed their scams, 
Reyes paid attention. "I listened, and I picked up the right pieces," 


he explains. Once out of jail, he applied for

"but it showed that I can do it." 


For the first time in his life, Reyes 
owned something. "By owning, your voice 
is heard," he explains. "I don't agree with 
out-of-towners corriing 
" 
in . . . and just having 
the attitude that, 'We'll 
rent to anyone. We 
don't care if they kill 
themselves.' And that's 
exactly 
what 
we're 
doing [in Fair Haven). 
We're 
killing 
our-
selves." 
Wessel 
explained 
further, 
"There's an old anar-
chist maxim: Property 
is theft ... Home own-
ership is abo~t build-
ing equity. When you 
rent, you're paying off 
someone else's mort-
gage. When you own, A 
your monthly payments 
are about building your net worth." 


Reyes soon got the idea to help his 
neighbors do as he had done and work 
towards owning homes. "Fair Haven is set 
up with a lot of people with bad credit, so 
how do you get [them] the opportunity to 
own? ... The same program that I did with 
myself, I'm doing with these people," he 
says. This is the genius of Angelo Reyes: By 
securing high-interest loans for homebuy-
ers, he allows them to build credit while 
owning their homes. The process demands 
hard work and sacrifice, but Reyes himself 
is an example of what can be done. 


But Reyes has competition. The Fair 
Haven Development Corporation (FHDC), 
a private, non-profit organi2ation, has a 
mission similar to Angelo's own, as 
described by its director, James R. Welter 
u: "to provide housing and community 
building services to the people of Fair 
Haven." Founded in 1994, the FHDC works 
have gone through our class and bought 
their own homes ... Most folks don't under-
stand how long it takes . . . It's not like 
going down to the grocery and buying a 
gallon of milk." For now, 
five graduates are "in the 
process" 
of 
buying 
homes-four in neigh-
borhoods outside Fair 
Haven. Out of prison 
since 1997, Reyes, in 
contrast, 
has already 
helped over 
50 Fair 
Haven residents pur-
chase their own homes. 


The 
difference 
between Reyes' approach 
and that of the FHDC and 
other similar city pro-
grams comes down to 
the issue of -credit. To 
actually buy a home 
with help from the FHDC 
or the city, you need to 
have good credit first. "Anyone can attend 
[our) class," Welter explains. "But the real-
iry is that not everyone is immediately 
ready to buy a home ... Quite frankly, peo-
ple have to be willing to do what they have 
to do to take care of credit problems." 


Reyes sees this attitude as part of the prob-
lem. "It takes too long for someone to fix 1 
their credit," he explains, "and the oppor-
tunities they have now won't be there once 
their credit is fixed." 


Reyes' status as a private entrepreneur 
and neighborhood insider is the key to his 
success. He can afford to bend rules and 
challenge statutes. He can share in the debt 
risks of his neighbors and spend out of his 
own pocket to back them up. He can fill in 
his alleyway and stand his ground. Having 
once considered running for city alderman, 
Reyes is nOV\' proud to be a private citizen. 
"I've been doing everything that [the alder-
men] were supposed to do. I have their
