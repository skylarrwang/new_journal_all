EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
NESTLED IN THE HEART of New Haven's thriving Elm Haven 
development area, Di.xwell Plaza remains vacant for the sixth year 
in a row. In contrast to the repaired and restored surrounding build-
ings, the squat concrete edifice at 156 Dixwell Avenue is a reminder 
of harder times for one of New Haven's oldest neighborhoods. 
Though the plaza was originally envisioned as a bustling commer-
cial center, not a single customer in the predominantly African-
American Dixwell coinmunity has been. served there in years. But 
last September, it seemed that would change. In their own attempt 
at the American dream, Cambodian immigrants Cong and May 
Lim scraped together enough money to buy the building and open 
a superette and laundromat. The purchase would provide needed 
services to Di.xwell while giving the Lims a chance at achieving 
financial independence. It seemed like the perfect parmership. 
Only the Lims missed something. It was almost as if there were a 
sign in the storefront window: Asian-Americans need not inquire. 
While driving down Dixwell Avenue one morning last 
September, Mrs. Lim noticed the vacant Oi.xwell Plaza, last occu-
pied by a ValuMart that declared bankruptcy in 1996. Thinking that 
the location might be ideal for a family-run grocery and laundro-
mat, she called City Hall. One-hundred fifty-six Dixwell, which the 
city bought from First Union Bank in 1999, was now in the hands 
of the Livable City Initiative (LCI), a program created by the Mayor 
in 1996 to facilitate property transfers and community develop-
ment. Though others had expressed interest in the property, only 
the Lims were able to put down an offer. In September 2000, the 
Lirns paid the city a ten percent deposit of $2o,ooo. Nevertheless, 
the Lims' petition to LCI was still subject to a hearing and approval 
by the New Haven Board of Aldermen. All seemed to go well for


the first few months-but little did the Lims know that there was a 
maelstrom gathering blocks away in the aldermanic chambers on 
Church street. 

Behind the controversy that continues to polarize the Board of 
Aldermen is Alderman Willie Greene of Newhallville, whose ward 
adjoins the Dixwell neighborhood, but does not include the plaza 
itself An outspoken activist for community development, Greene 
also sits on the LCI advisory board. The first the board saw of the 
Lim deal was a signed conttact and deposit. Greene immediately 
raised objections to the Lims' purchase, claiming that the property 
had not been aggressively marketea to African-American business-
people. However, LCI continued to back the deal over the next ten 
months as it proceeded to the final stage of negotiation, subject to 
a vote of approval by the Board of Aldermen. 

Which was no mere formality. After nearly ten months, the 
Lims' proposal fmally came before the Board of Aldermeh on May 
21. Yet, in less than two hours, the family found the item tabled and 
their hopes indefinitely delayed. Though two other aldermen joined 
Greene's petition, only he spoke publicly in opposition. To May 
Lim, the motion signified one important fact: namely, that she and 
her husband were unwanted in Dixwell. She explained, "Mr. 
Greene [essentially] said they don't sell to me. They don't want 
Asian people." 

At a public hearing later in the summer Greene remained in 
opposition to the Lims' purchase, while officials of LCI, Oixwell 
Alderman Jelani Lawson, a representative of the Oixwell Merchants 
and Professionals Association, and a local African-American busi-
nessman spoke in favor of the Lirns' purchase. However, in closed 
meetings with city officials, everyone began to feel the strain of a 
process that had dragged on too long. Shortly before the Board of 
Aldermen meeting slated for August 6, the Lims threw up their 
hands and withdrew their deposit with the city for 156 Dixwell. 

Yet, the issue hadn't been formally closed. According to the 
minutes of the August 6 meeting, while Alderman Lawson attempt-
ed to end discussion by noting that the Lims had withdrawn their 
offer "after the political hullabaloo that erupted in the neighbor-
hood surrounding this issue," Alderman Greene prolonged the con-
versation. "I want to make this very clear for the record my opposi-
tion to this particular sale," Greene said and outlined his objections 
for the board. He argued that the African-American community 
was not "properly informed" and "that's where my opposition 
came." "While the sale of the market, I really believe, would have 
been good for the Lims and good for Dixwell Plaza," he explained, 
"personally, I think this was an affront to the black community." He 
repeated that his objections were not against the Lims and said, 
"Again, I am very sadden[ed] that the Lims did pull out, but I 
would never apologize for standing up in my community and talk-
ing about building an economic base. And if doing that makes me 
a racist, well then I'm the biggest racist that ever did walk on two 
feet." 

T HESE DAYS, everyone involved with the Lims is talking about 
'process', thanks to Alderman Greene. Reflecting on the 1 0-month 
struggle, Alderman Lawson commented that it was the very "fact 
that there was a process that led to the Lims withdrawing." If the 
Lims' purchase was as "abnormally simple from a process point of 
view," as Mickey Mercer of the city's Office of Legislative Services 
claims, what, then, went wrong? 

Most likely, it is because Alderman Greene and LCI labor under 
rwo different definitions of process. To Greene, process means the 
participation of his own Dixwell community. And to LCI, process 
ultimately is the best strategy for economic development. 

LCI and the city have both publicly backed the Lims. Lei's 
Executive Director Regina Winters claims that "we supported their 
application from the beginning." Deputy Director Nick Tomeo, 
who has been struggling to dispose of the unwanted property for 
years, defends the process employed by LCI. Addressing Greene's 
objections, Tomeo explained that the building was marketed under 
a "negotiated sale provision," meaning that the district alderman 
(Lawson), the Dixwell Management team, the Dixwell Merchants 
Association, Yale's property czar Bruce Alexander, and other inter-
ested parries were all informed of the impending deal. Tomeo calls 
the process "fair and open" and insists that "[whatever] takes place 
afterwards ... one can't blame the city." 

Dixwell Plaza was unwanted and vacant for years. Though the 
city invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in the redevelopment 
of Elm Haven throughout the early 1990S, resources grew tight at 
the end of the decade and progress lagged in the Dix:well neighbor-
hood. Dix:well Plaza, with its history of bankruptcy and back taxes, 
was considered a near lost cause. By marketing 156 Dix:well under 
the 'negotiated sale' clause--which is to say not publicly marketing 
the building at all with the exception of a small poster in the win-
dow-LCI avoided expenses and crossed its fingers that someone 
would make an offer. Greene is right in saying that the process was-
n't as open as it could have been. But the "lack of competitiveness" 
was likely because no one was seriously interested in competing. 
When the Lims came with a pledge to try their best to make their
