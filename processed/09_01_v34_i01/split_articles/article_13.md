"an extremely rewarding" experience. She 
explained co me that, once in a while, 
something can go wrong, and I braced 
myself for the fine print. On very rare 
occasions, hyperstimulation of the 
ovaries can occur and the donor 
is 
hospitalized 
until 
the 
ovaries return to normal. In 
even rarer cases, 
ovaries rupture, result-
ing in 
permanent 
infertility or possi-
bly even death. "I 
must stress that 
this is very 
rare," Sherry assured me. "I had two won-
derful experiences. The second time I even 
stayed awake to help the doctor count how 
many eggs he retrieved." 

David responded quickly to my email, 
only hours after I'd sent it. He told me 
nothing about himself or his wife and hard-
ly mentioned the egg-donation process. 
The bulk of the email was a strange 
description of a cartoon, followed by a 
request for photos of me. The cartoon, he 
wrote, "is a scene with a couple getting 
married: he a nerd and she a great beauty. 
They are kvelling about their future child 
with his brains and her good looks. The 
next panel shows a nerdy looking baby 
thinlcing empty thoughts." This introduc-
tion baffied me. Maybe this guy was a nerd 
hoping to avoid the same kind of disaster, 
or maybe he was simply trying to make 
light of the fact that he was potentially 
going to pay me more than a year ofYale's 
tuition for my egg. I thanked him for the 
email and ~ked once again about egg 
donation, their criteria, and how to 
send my pictures. 

The next email was more 
direct and in worse taste. David 
let me know that they were 
flexible on most criteria but 
that his wife "is a real Nazi 
on: donor looks and 
donor health history." 
He promised 
to 
return my photos, 
so I sent him a 
strange assorr-
ment of pic-
tures-dorm 
room pictures, the 
kind that every Yalie 
has lying around. Now 
they were evidence. I 
would soon learn what this 
konymous couple somewhere 
in the us thought about my 
genetic material. 


INFERTILITY IS NOT A modern problem, 
but it has created a modern industry. 
One in six American couples is infertile, 
and more than 50 percent of those couples 
contribute to the $2 billion-a-year fertility 
industry. The Federal Trade Commission 
even publishes a booklet to assist prospec-
tive parents in sifting their options. I 
empathize with women who cannot use 
their own eggs to have a child. It must be a 
sober awakening for those who have always 
dreamed of raising their own f.unily. But 
when faced with this problem, prospective 
parents' options depend greatly upon their 
wealth. All over the world, women who 
can't have children must simply accept the 
fact and find other roles in society. Here in 
the us, people's means dictate their ability 
to have their own child and determine how 
closely that child will resemble the one they 
might have had-or the one they dream of 
having. 

On the website of Egg Donation Inc., 
there is a whole database of potential genet-
ic material. In order to access the list of 300 
potential donors, interested parties must 
call the company and requ~st. the password 
for the month. Once I'd given the recep-
tionist on the phone my name and address, 
she told me the password for August: col-
orful. I hung up and entered the database. 
Potential parents can search for a variety of 
features, narrowing the pool as much as 
they like. "Select Egg Donor Criteria: 
Ethnic Origin, Religion of Birth, State, 
Hair Color, Eye Color, Height." In this 
way, couples find women willing to help 
them create the child of their dreams. I 
entered the characteristics that Michelle 
and David were looking for into the data-
base and found four potential donors. 
None of them had college degrees. 
The standard compensation for an egg 
from Egg Donation Inc. is between $2,000 
and $3,500, and "additional funds are 
offered to donors that have advanced 
degrees or are of Asian or Jewish decent."

This significantly s~aller compensation, I 
learned, affects the nature of the clients and 
donors involved. Couples searching for an 
egg at Egg Donation Inc. can be picky, but 
not as demanding as couples advertising in 
the News. Is it fair that a couple can pay for 
a high-standard egg and have that lcind of 
child? Maybe it is simply an update of 
Social Darwinism. Modern success is large-
ly dependent on finances, so why shouldn't 
the most successful couple have access to 
the most successful, most expensive eggs? 
Of course, as David pointed out in his first 
email, input does not always translate per-
fectly into output-the donor's potentially 
desirable characteristics may never be man-
ifest in the child. 

If a couple chooses not to find their 
egg through an agency, they must do so 
independently. A search on the Internet 
turned up a few sites like Surrogate 
Mothers Online where donors and would-
be parents can post classified ads. There 
were more than 500 posted dassifieds on 
the site. A whole marketplace, an eBay for 

"Hi! My name is Kimberly," read one 
of the ads. "I am 24 years old, 5'n" with 
blonde hair and green eyes. I previously 
donated eggs and the couple was blessed 
with BIG twin boys! The doctor told me I 
have perky ovaries! ... The doctor told me I 
had the most perfect eggs he had ever 
seen." There were links to this woman's 
photographs as well as an email address. 
Parents on the site offered "competitive" 
rates, generally between $5,000 and 
$10,000 for donors who fit their design. 


ONE AFTERNOON THIS SUMMER, on a 
highway in rural Minnesota, a baby's 
face smiled down at me from a billboard. 
The sign read, in huge letters, "I am a 
designer baby." The phrase "designer baby" 
threw me for a loop. Snippets of conversa-
tions by future parents searching through 
J.Crew catalogs of possible children began 
SEPTEMBER 7Â· 2001 
to play in my head. "Yes, we'd like item 
9JIOI7K, the blonde, long-legged genius ... 
She's on sale this week, right?" 

About a week after I sent the pictures 
I received a third email. "Got the pictures, 
you look perfect. I can't say this with any 
authority, that is my wife's department. 
She's been known to disregard a young 
woman based on cheekbones, hair, nose, 
you name it. I think you have the right 
looks but I'll have to wait until she gets 
"The doctor 
told me I have 
perky ovaries/ 
The doctor told 
me I had the 
most perfect 
eggs he had 
ever seen!' 
back in town to subject them to her judg-
ment." He then shifted the focus to my 
brain. "My department is the SAT scores. 
Can you tell me more about your academ--
ic performance? What are you talcing at 
Yale? What high school did you attend? Do 
you have any idea what you want to do?" I 
was overwhelmed. The whole thing seemed 
like a joke. I dutifully answered his ques-
tions, explaining that I was from a no-
name high school in the Midwest, I could-
n't do math or science, and I hadn't 
planned my summer, let alone the rest of 
my life . . 

Michelle and David now had my edu-
cational stats as well as my photos. They 
were examining my credentials and trying 
to imagine their child. If I was accepted, a 
harvest of my eggs would be fertilized by 
the frozen semen of the author of the dis-
turbing emails I had received. A few 
embryos would be implanted, a few would 
be frozen, and then I would be out of the 
picture forever. Would these embryos from 
my egg grow to be this couple's dream 
child? 

THE MODERN EMBRYO has been frozen, 
I ;tolen, aborted, researched and deliv-
ered weeks early along with five or six 
instant siblings. This summer was full of 
embryo news. The first big story was 
President Bush's deliberations on stem-cell 
research. The embryos available for genetic 
research include those frozen by fertility 
clinics for later use by couples using in vitro 
fertilization. 

Embryos took the spotlight again 
when Helen Beasley, a surrogate mother 
from Shrewsbury, England, decided to sue 
a San Francisco couple for the parenting 
rights to the twin fetuses she is carrying. 
The couple and Beasley had signed a con-
tract for $20,000 for one child created 
from a donated egg and the father's sperm, 
co be carried by Beasley. The contract also 
called for selective reduction-the abortion 
of any extra embryos-by the twelfth 
week. The problem arose when Beasley dis-
covered she was carrying twins in the 13th 
week. Fearing for her own health and 
objecting to the abortion of such highly-
developed fetuses, she refused to end her 
pregnancy. She is suing for parental rights, 
which would allow her co put the babies up 
for adoption. She is also seelcing the origi-
nal financial compensation promised to her 
by the couple with which she contracted. 
They do not want the children. And yet, 
they have rights to the genetic makeup; 
Beasley is simply the vessel. The case is only 
one of a multitude spawned by modern fer-
tility processes. On August 15, Th~ N~ 
York Times reported that a woman in New 
York was suing for ~e rights to the
