EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Thank you for Patrick Casey Pins' informative article on the Yale 
School of Drama dean search (The Dean's the Thing. Vol. 33.5). 
It's baflling that people here are so resistant to the challenge of 
such a singular artist as Anne Bogart. Among actors, she's famous 
for not only her aesthetic integrity, but also her remarkable gen-
erosiry and compassion-qualities which, in fact, can make a huge 
difference in a production's outcome. After all, theater depends on 
a group of human beings being able to work with one another 
over time. 

There are two things which you might have added to your argu-
ment: 
1) The important contributions to us theater the Rep made in 
the years between Brustein and Wojewodski. Under Lloyd 
Richards, Yale Rep was the home to every Athol Fugard world pre-
miere; provided the launching pad for playwright August Wilson's 
huge career; introduced plays by Lee Blessing that became interna-
tional successes (A Walk in the WOods, Cobb); gave the world perhaps 
the finest production of Long Day's journey Into Night ever staged 
(Colleen Dewhurst and Jason -Robards starring, Jose Quintero 
directing); and produced from YSD a large number of now-promi-
nent actors, directors and designers (Angela Bassett, Charles 
Dutton, David Alan Grier, Marcus Stern, Evan Yiannoulis, 
Christopher Ackerlind, and on and on). 
2) Regarding the Trinity Rep: You didn't mention that Anne 
Bogart used to be the Artistic Director there-for one year, until 
the timorous board of directors puUed the plug on her. Their excuse 
was the same as the one implied here: the red-herring issue of man-
agement skills. The fact is, in Bogart's one season, she actually 
increased Trinity's subscriber base. At any theater, the installation of 
a new artistic director usually causes a dropoff in subscriptions-
often temporary, while audiences adjust to the new regime. Doesn't 
bringing in more money count as a management skill?
