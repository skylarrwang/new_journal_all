EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
few weeks ago I was having 
in Oaxaca with a 
art student, a Polish hardcore bassist, ' 
and an' lta)jan experimental mime dancer (this is not a joke). Four young bohemians, four native languages, and yet ' 
we managed to have a political discussion. This consisted mainly of vehement agreement about the evils of gloha/izacion. • ~ 
Despite the gentle irony, I felt hip; I was a global citizen that day. 

I don't think I'm alone in this experience. Seemingly everyone I talk co at Yale has just come back from the ends of the earth, .. 
and is headed there again. Of the last twelve months, I've spent a total of two in Mexico, Moscow, Morocco, and Costa Rica. This sum-
mer, some of my closest friends were in Egypt, China, Germany, Sicily, Russia, Bocswana, Cuba, and Lithuania. 
The Grand Tour is a rice of passage about as old as Yale itself. In the 18th century, it denoted well-off young Brits scrolling through the , 
Piazza Di Spagna, and by the 19th, American students were flocking to the venerated German universities in Heidelberg or Gottingen, taking 
time off to tour the Louvre or bicycle through Scotland. The most adventurous might have made it as far as Egypt or the Holy Land. Eighteen 
out of 130 members of Yale's class of 1886 headed overseas after graduation. 

As recently as five years ago, the uadition of foreign study was languishing at Yale. Only three percent of the junior class spent a semester abroad 
in 1996. Today, that number has doubled, and a survey last spring indicated chat almost a fifth of the senior class had spent part of their education 
abroad, when summers, semesters, and leaves of absence were considered. And the countries explored are getting more exotic. "We definitely have 
seen larger numbers of students uave!Hng to China, Japan, and Korea, because of the Light Fellowship," which pays for a summer or full year of 
Ease Asian language study, says Karyn Jones, Study Abroad Advisor of the International Education and Fellowship Programs office. "More students 
are choosing Central and South America, Buenos Aires and Santiago, for Spanish study, instead of the obvious Spain. And Africa~ all of Africa, is 
getting more popular." 

Why, in an age when everything is getting closer together, do people want co get farther away? Partly because travelling is just what modem 
people do. In his 1975 book The Tourist: A New Theory of the Leisure Class, sociologist Dean MacCanneU posited the tourist as the epitome of the 
modern man. Tourism shares with modernity an extreme commodification of experience ("Five Nights! Six Days! $595!") and a search for authen-
ticity. Sightseeing may also be an expression of the modern desire to impose order on a chaotic world. Foe a tourist, a city like Paris or Marrakech 
is easily parsed into "must-sees" and "must-avoids," a simplification that the lifetime resident could never enjoy. Sightseeing, MacCanneU writes, "is 
uniquely well-suited among leisure alternatives co draw the tourist into a relationship with the modern social totality." In other words, we go to see 
-·nnrhi•r><r. to determine what "everything" is, and to see how we relate to everything. 

In the 1970s, perhaps, authenticity came more easily. Tripping was more than an expression; people still believed in the possibility of drop-
out of society. And hippie backpackers, tourist attractions themselves back in Haight-Ashbury, were blazing a new kind of path from Bali 
in Indonesia to Goa in India. These days, students have to go a little farther on their journeys of self-discovery co avoid following in their • 
footsteps. 

But the latitudes that backpackers uek across these days are often depressingly similar. In all the countries I've visited, there are #' 
street markets and upsetting numbers of homeless people. There are many more houses of worship than at home, and musicians II 
on the streets. There are strange breakfast foods, and Coca-Cola in bottles, served without ice. There are the ubiquitous #' 
cafes--connections co the home we're crying to leave behind. Not only that, but we all do pretty much the 11

., • same things with our ti;e. Whether we are volunteers or students, we are 
playing "tourist." We take our pic-
tures, practice our languages, write in our journals while sitting in a little cafe at the edge of the plaza, go for hikes in 
• 11 the desert and the ruins and the mountains and the waterfalls. We complain about all the other tourists. 

Going through our paces in that single country called Abroad, we are, of course, looking to be broadened. Within limits. 
We leave our own communities to join the global communiry, always knowing that the experience will have an ending. that we will 
come home again. But one night a few weeks ago, sitting at che computer in that youth hostel in Oaxaca, Mexico, I read that Narasha 
Smalls, a friend of mine from freshman year, had disappeared in South Africa. 

The Hartford Courant article in the email raised more questions than it provided answers. Natasha abducted? Placed in a mental insti-
tution against her:. ~ill? Drugged? This was a travel experience without a safety net. Not knowing anyone at the hostel, I confided mY worries in 
my bunkmate Yad; a girl uaveUing the world after getting out of the Israeli atmy. She told me about her two years stationed in Eilat while her 
boyfriend was in skirmishes at the Lebanese border, at the other end of the country. There would be unnamed casualties, the phones would go out, 
and she would have no idea where he was, or if he was safe. But at least the cwo of them were fellow soldiers, not particles floating about in the 
stratosphere. 

When I first heard the news, I was hundreds of miles away from anyone I knew, communicating in halting Spanish. I like to see the world as 
a smorgasbord of poisibilities, but suddenly it seemed like a frightening place. I like to think of myself as a proud member of many intersecting 
communities, but suddenly I felt alone. In my thoughts I rebelled against the very idea of community. Much is said in its praise, but here was a ter-
rible drawback-your vulnerability to loss is extended as wide as the circle you join. I never met Suzanne Jovin, but when she was murdered in 1998 
I lost a member of my college, and I shared in the grief of my master, my dean, and the students and faculry who knew her. Sophomore year, my 
window in Davenport's back courtyard looked out on her small memorial plaque under a tree. 

Now 1-with all of Yale--was missing Narasha. There's nothing to say when someone is missing. Consolations ate casteless. You have to hold 
your breath, and sometimes your tongue, and hope. When I came back to school the next week, everyone knew. Her face was up on fliers all over 
New Haven, just like Suzanne's face had been. There was a vigil planned for her August 23 at the Afro-American Cenrer. But chat was the day 
Narasha came back. She called her mother from Johannesburg, and asked her to come take her home. 

This incident has me worried, especially because I've taken the first few steps down the road ro Kyrgyzstan, one of the smaller former Soviet, 
independent, Old Silk Road nations. Whar began as a wild whim last May has taken root and spread leaves over the summer. This time next 
after a gantlet of interviews and miles of red tape, I just might find myself the recipient of a government grant, working on a journalism 
in the capital city of Bishkek, which I imagine as turreted. Why am I drawn to this country, whose name I didn't know four months 
My patents want to know, desperately. limbuktu or Karhmandu would be fine with them, but this is going a little roo far. 
1 could summon up a hosr of socially acceptable reasons, which is, coincidentally, what the application requires. Bur maybe it's just 
an extreme reaction to graduation, a Grand Tour for the new century. I want to forge a meaningfully unique identity out there in 
the post-Stalinist muck. I want to come face-to-face with myself, and escape aU previous expectations. It strikes me that these are 
' 
some of the same reasons I joined the Yale community, and I'm overcome by the same emotion: ambivalence. I wanted to ~ 
avoid playing a pre-defined role here, but I also wanted to find my plac.e in the world. And I'm still looking.
