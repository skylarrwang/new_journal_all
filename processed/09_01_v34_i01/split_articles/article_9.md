SOMETHING BIG IS AiouT TO HAPPEN with 
labor in New Haven. At least the AFL-C;O 
thinks so. Last spring, the national labor 
federation dispatched to the Elm City a 
leading field representative, a maverick 
who specializes in large-scale mobilizations. 
(He is rumored to have been a lead labor 
organizer at the historic WTO protest in 
Seattle in 1999.) The Yale administration is 
not supposed to know he's here, and he 
does not speak to the 
press. 
His 
name 
is 
Vinnie O'Brien. 

April 20, 2001, was 
a day of jarring contrasts 
in New Haven. At 4PM, 
many of Yale's most ven-
erated alumni-a page 
out of the Who's Who of 
the American aristocra-
cy--convened in stately 
Woolsey Hall for the 
opening event of the 
University's 
second 
300th anniversary · cele-
bration. However, as for-
mer Secretary of the 
Treasury Robert Rubin 
and 
one-time 
chair-
woman of the President's 
Council of Economic 
Advisors Janet Yellen 
pontificated about the state of the 
American economy, a crowd of 2,200 Yale 
employees, hospital workers, politicians, 
union organizers, local clergy, and Yale stu-
dents amassed on the New Haven Green, a 
block from Woolsey. Their purpose: to 
wrest the world's attention from the ter-
centennial event and redirect it towards 
New Haven's charging labor movement. 

The scene at the rally, however, offered 
a few jarring conuasts of its own. C lean-cut 
students locked arms with dining hall 
workers and secretaries. On stage, the rab-
hie-rousing speeches of Democratic politi-
c:ians and burly union men gave way to the 
soft-spoken words of a PHD student in a 
cashmere scar£ As the student-a member 
of the Graduate Employees and Students 
Organization (GESO)-spoke about the 
union's multi-year struggle for recognition, 
quoting from A Chorus Line and referring 
to French literature papers in the process, a 
. baffled silence fell over the crowd. 

New Haven's labor movement is a 
complex coalition of disparate groups. The 
city's two established unions are Locals 34 
and 35, united under the Hotel Employees 
and Restaurant Employees International 
Union (HERE) and representing Yale's sec-
vice and maintenance staff. Meanwhile, 
Oisuict II99 of the Service Employees 
International Union (SEIU) and GESO strug-
gle to establish unions for Yale-New Haven 
Hospital workers and graduate student 
teaching assistants, respectively. Each is 
demanding that their employer accept 
what is known as card-check neuuality-
impartiality in the organizing stages and 
recognition once more than half of the 
workers, or in the case of GESO, graduate 
students, have signed a card expressing sol-
idarity with the union. (With card-check 
neutrality, organizers claim, victory is 
inevitable.) At the same time, a nascent 
undergraduate "student union" seeks an 
expanded role in the decision-making 
processes of the University. 

T he five groups-Locals 34 and 35, 
II99• GESO, and me undergraduates-make 
up an incongruous alliance, loosely orga-
nized under the Federation of Hospital and 
University Employees (FHUE). When their 
contracts with Yale expire on January r, 
2002, Local 34 and Local 3 5 will demand 
that the University 
agree to card-check 
neutrality 
in 
the 
unionizing efforts of 
hospital workers and 
graduate 
students. 
"~e have a very 
unique partnership 
here between four 
groups of very differ-
ent workers who are 
looking beyond the 
traditional way in 
which people have 
things in common," 
said 
Deborah 
Chernoff, a full-time 
employee of 1199 
who also serves as the 
Communications 
Director of FHUE. 

And union leaders, 
whether students or workers, express confi-
dence that the alliance, united by a broad-
er sense of civic involvement and social jus-
tice, will stand up in the face of pressure 
from Yale's administration. 

When the people in this alliance 
explained to me what has brought them 
together, their reasons seem, at first, sus-
pect. They talk about "vision" and a "strug-
gle for justice." "Suddenly, people have 
statted to see a vision of a better version of 
the University 
as 
possible," 
Carlos 
Aramayo, a member of GESo's coordinating 
committee, told me. "The University 
should be responsive to the community 
and high-minded. That's exactly the kind 
of public sphere a university should be, and 

that won't happen unless hospital workers 
are organized, unless clergymen are orga-
nized, unless janitors are organized, unless 
students are organized, unless the commu-
nity is organized." 

This broad conception of community 
interest manifests itself in a variety of ways, 
many of which are a far cry from the tradi-
tional concerns of organized labor. Abbey 
Hudson, de facto head of the undergradu-
ate union, likes to point out that last April, 
when Local 34 was pamphleting tercenten-
nial weekend alumni gatherings, the flier it 
distributed at the culminating event-an 
afrernoon session headlined by the elder 
President Bush--deatt not with pay .scales 
or labor rights, but with financial aid. The 
highly publicized report this August about 
Yale's historical relationship with slave 
owners, authored by three GESO members, 
was also strongly supported by the unions. 

Antony Dugdale, one of the report's 
authors and a labor organizer, said, "This 
scholarship on slavery and the union each 
fit into a larger struggle. They're sides of the 
same coin, both part of the fight for justice 
in New Haven." 

Ultimately, though, the strategies and 
partnerships pursued by labor activists in 
New Haven are as pragmatic as they are 
idealistic. "It is in our self-interest to be 
mutually interested and go beyond narrow 
definitions," Chernoff said. Only united, 
organizers say, can they contend with an 
employer-Yale--which directly controls a 
quarter of New Haven's jobs and indiroctly 
controls an even larger portion (a fact 
which labor activists quote ad nauseam). 

One night in August, I joined three 
labor organizers, including a recent Yale 
graduate and a PHD student in Yale's histo-
ry department, at The Second Star of 
Jacob, a Pentecostal church in the predom-
inantly Latino Fair Haven neighborhood. 
The three began a PowerPoint presentation 
in Spanish on why, New Haven workers 
must unionize in front of xoo-some parish-
ioners, many of whom are employed by 
Yale and closely connected industries. The 
congregation chattered and shifred restless-
ly. I took this reaction as a lack of interest, 
an excuse for my own skepticism. Halfway 
through the presentation, the Yale graduate 
student offered her own testimonial, detail-
ing her reasons for wanting to unionize 
graduate teachers and attempting to con-
nect her plight to the plights of.custodians 
and dining hall workers. 

Ten minutes later, we walked out of 
the chapel. In the church lobby, we were 
stopped. Parishioners wanted to say thanks. 
To tell their stories. "You have blessed us by 
coming here," one said, in heavily accented 
English. Before we left, he insisted on giv-
ing each of us--even me-a hug. 

The incongruous alliance of workers 
and students and community members 
represents a new hope for a faltering 
national labor movement--one on which 
its continued relevance may depend. 

Organized labor has struggled to adapt to 
an economy in which service jobs now out-
number those in traditionally unionized 
manufacturing 
industries; 
nationally, 
union membership has plummeted to 13 
percent of the workforce, and leaders have 
struggled to replace an increasingly out-
moded model. A victory for labor at Yale 
will send shock waves around the nation. 

"If this model is successful-and it will 
be--it V(ill provide a real example for 
unions around the nation to follow," 
declared Nick Allen, an organizer with 
1199· 

On October 5, Yale will continue its 
tercentennial celebration with a final gala 
weekend, and the world will be watching. 
If Vinnie O'Brien and the new labor 
alliance have their way, headlines will be 
more about protest than pageantry- and a 
national movement will be on its way to 
revitalization.
