EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
THREE YALE PHD CANDIDATES published a 
report this summer, "Yale, Slavery and 
Abolition," which put together a number 
of unsurprising facts into a substantial case. 
The story was all over The New York Times. 
Eight of Yale's twelve residential colleges 
were named after former slave owners. 
Furthermore, Yale, like many northern 
institutions, was financially dependent on 
profits from slavery through the 18th and 
19th centuries. To Yale students, the name 
"Calhoun" may bring forth images of a 
quaint courtyard bordering Cross Campus, 
but outside the bounds of Chapel and 
Prospect streets it conjures up 
South Carolina's promi- _ 
nent slave owner, 
plantation mas-
ter, and senator 
John 
C. 
Calhoun-a man 
who 
ardently 
advocated 
the 
expansion of slavery 
throughout the nation. 

The debate on op-
ed pages has been cen-
tered on the philosophical 
idea of "presentism"-that 
is, to what extent modern 
critics, using contemporary 
standards, can judge the moral 
worth of decisions made in the 
past. The naming of residential col-
leges, however, poses a more histori-
cal and less philosophical question: 
How did the administration choose 
which Yale figures to honor? 

Morse College, named for telegraph 
inventor Samuel F. B. Morse, is another res-
idential college that honors a Yale alumnus 
who displayed zealous support for slavery. 
In 1955, Yale used a $2.5 million grant from 
John A Whitney, class of 1926, to purchase 
the land to build the eleventh and twelfth 
colleges. This forced three New Haven 
high schools to relocate, 
including 
Hillhouse High School, named for the 
prominent abolitionist, Yale graduate, and 
senator James Hillhouse. The colleges were 
built there between 1958 and 1962, after the 
university secured a $15 million grant from 
Paul Mellon, class of 1929. Seven and a half 
million of Mellon's grant was used for the 
construction, while the remaining $7.5 mil-
lion continues to fund educational pro-
grams, such as college seminars and the 
Mellon Forum, within all the residential 
colleges. 

So why is it that Morse and Stiles are 
not known as Whitney and Mellon? Both 
John A. Whitney and Paul Mellon were 
prominent Yale alumni; Whitney served as 
the publisher of the New York Herald 
Tribune as well as an ambassador to 
Britain 
under 
President 
Eisenhower. 
Mellon 
had 
a career 
at 
Yale 
marked by acade-
mic 
and 
extracurricular 
accomplishments 
already 
bestowed grants upon Yale that continue to 
fund academic programs to this day, 
including the Directed Studies program in 
the humanities. Upon acquiring the grant, 
Yale President A. Whitney Griswold, in a 
letter to Mellon, wrote that "no university 
in [his] knowledge has had so enlightened 
a benefactor." In fact, he has since become 
Yale's largest individual donor. 

A file of correspondence relating to 
proposed names for the two new colleges in 
Sterling Memorial Library's Manuscripts 
and Archives makes one allusion to Paul 
Mellon-a 
pamphlet 
for 
Residential Hall at St. John's College in 
Annapolis, Maryland, with a note penciled 
in, stating that Mellon was "not averse to 
the use of his name." (A residential 
hall at Harvard is also named for 
him.) Aside from that, the folder 
contains various other propos-
als for names. There was one 
from Betty Hotchkiss in 
1958, asking that the uni-
versity consider naming 
one of the new colleges in 
honor of her relative 
Noah Webster, creator of 
the first American dic-
tionary. That same year, 
the alumni director of 
the class of 1910 pro-
posed that one of the 
colleges be named Taft 
College in honor of 
President Taft and his 
son, the late Senator 
Bob Taft, class of 1910. 
Also contained in the 
file is a list of authors 
affiliated 
with Yale, 
including â€¢ 
James 
Fenimore Cooper, Sinclair 
Lewis, and Thornton Wilder, 
noting that many of these 
names seem "a bit too contem-
porary . . . too bad we don't have a 
wider selection in this field." 

The proposal that won the 
administration's approval was from 
Theodore Sizer, an alumnus who is now 
professor emeritus of education at Brown 
University. Written in a florid jade-green 
calligraphy, Sizer's letter to President 
Griswold asks, "What other graduate of the 
university has become the universal man? 
. . . What other Yale man has there been 
whose name has become a noun?" In a later 
letter, Sizer also wrote that the name 
"'Morse College' is euphonious." What the 
letter failed to mention is that Morse pub-
lished articles defending slavery as part of 
God's ordained plan and that he served as 
the president of two pro-slavery organiza-


tions, the American Society for the 
Promotion of National Unity and the 
Society for the Diffusion of Political 
Knowledge. 

Would simply naming one of Yale's 
residential colleges after its donor be too 
simple? In naming a residential college 
"Mellon College," perhaps Yale felt that it 
would discount its heritage and tradition-
the tombs of its societies and the acid-
washed stone facades of its colleges. Paul 
Mellon's gift of $15 million, however, was 
not just for the construction of traditional 
undergraduate residences-it was for the 
development of a novel educational system. 
In a letter written to President Griswold in 
1958, Mellon wrote that his grant "may also 
serve as a stimulus to other donors and to 
other colleges to keep liberal education lib-
eral!" Griswold echoed the thoughts of 
Mellon when he wrote that higher educa-
tion has "put a premium on the residential 
college as a means of cultivating and refin-
ing students in moral and aesthetic terms." 
Quoting Sir Lawrence Johns, Griswold 
defined the purpose of the residential col-
lege to be "a miniature of what a civilized 
western community should provide for us 
all." 

While Yale let tradition pervade its 
nomenclature, it implemented an innova-
tive system of education in the US. It is in 
this sense that the question of "presentism" 
may very well be overshadowed by the 
question of historical process. That colleges 
bearing the names of slaveholders were cre-
ated with the intention of fostering a liber-
al education can be viewed as simply a lack 
of historical perspective and not a lack of 
morality. Perhaps the irony of tradition lies 
here: To view the residential colleges' 
names as symbols of Yale's morality is to 
become slave to the same burden of tradi-
tion to which the university's previous 
administrations succumbed.
