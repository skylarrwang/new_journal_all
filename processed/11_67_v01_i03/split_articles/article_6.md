Why history? seems to me an altogether 
fitting and proper question. Those who 
profess a religious faith recognize that 
their profession becomes dead unless it is 
renewed by frequent rediscovery of its 
reason for being. Accordingly, the 
religious professor may quest from a 
first to a second, from a second to a third 
profession of religious faith during a 
lifetime's experience of ultimate things. 
The man committed to a craft should 
ask no less of himself. He should 
frequently inquire what task it was that 
he chose to perform with this particular 
set of tools, and he should be prepared 
to change tools if the task's requirements 
seem to have changed. 

I decided to become a historian when I 
was twenty-nine. I had "taken" (an odd 
word) no more than two or three semesters 
of history as an undergraduate. But 
during a checkered and prolonged 
adolescence in which I did graduate work 
in city planning, served as a non-
combatant conscientious objector in the 
United States Army, milked cows and 
made children's toys in a utopian com-
munity, and organized site tenants on 
New York's Lower East Side, I carried 
about with me two books on history: 
The Historian's Craft by Marc Bloch and 
The Idea of History by R. G. Collingwood. 
I liked these books. Bloch's appealed 
to me because he wrote it as a member 
of the French Resistance, without the 
aid of books and papers, shortly before 
his death at the hands of the Nazis, and 
because he conveyed a sense of history as 
a craft: something which had its own 
tools, which demanded, so to speak, a feel 
for cloth and leather before one could 
do it well, a discipline to which a man 
might apprentice himself. 

History as described by Bloch appeared 
to be controlled by its opaque, objective 
events and thus to be Jess prone to 
arbitrary manipulation and subjective 
whim than other social science disciplines. 
The Idea of History was attractive for 
the opposite reason. It demythologized 
the aura surrounding the historical pro-
fession by insisting that in the last analysis 
all a man's mind could know of the past 
was the minds of other men, so that 
"history" in fact amounted to rethinking 
a portion of what human beings had 
thought before. "Progress," then, was 
defined by Collingwood as action preced-
ing from thought which had experienced 
the best of previous thought. 

Taken together the two books seemed 
to me the embodiment of intellectual 
elegance; the intelJectual activity they 
analyzed appeared solid, and serviceable 
to strivings toward a better world which 
mattered very much to me. 

When I "went in" to history I began 
with Charles Beard's interpretation of the 
United States Constitution. I now think 
there were two reasons for this choice, 
somewhat in tension with each other. 
At the time, I explained by choice of 
subject matter on the ground that Beard's 
was the most important attempt to date 
at an economic interpretation of American 
history, and that I was enough of a Marxist 
STAUGHTON LYND is an assistant 
professot of history at Yale. He was direc-
tor of the Mississippi Freedom Schools 
in the summer of 1964, and he is currently 
on leave of absense in Chicago, where he 
is seeking to translate the educational 
techniques of the '64 Summer to the 
northern ghetto, and teaching at Chicago 
State University. 
to find this a logical point of departure. 
I began my work as a historian by 
seeking a local microcosm in which to 
test the thesis of Beard's Economic 
Interpretation Of The United States 
Constitution. I have mixed feelings about 
it now. On the one band it still make'l 
sense to me that, like any other scientist, 
the historian should formulate hypotheses 
and then test them against a restricted 
range of data, such as what happened in 
one area or in one man's life. On the 
other hand I am now more conscious 
that I selected a range of data which 
I could be pretty certain would sub-
stantiate the thesis I hoped was true. 

I studied opposition to the United States 
Constitution in Dutchess County, New 
York, because Dutchess County had a 
history of landlord-tenant conflict very 
likely to be connected with how groups 
aligned themsel\'es for or against ratifica-
tion of the Constitution. 

The bias involved in my selection of 
Dutchess County did not necessarily 
invalidate my findings, but it raised serious 
question as to their generalizability. I 
believe this is how bias characteristically 
operates in the work of other historians, 
too: not in deliberate mishandling of 
evidence, but in selection of research 
design. 

The second reason I began with Beard 
became clear to me only gradually. 
Beard's work dealt with the American 
Revolution and its overall meaning. 
Implicitly and to a certain extent ex-
plicitly, Beard asked: were the Founding 
Fathers activated by abstract ideas and 
a devotion to public welfare, or were they 
also motivated by personal economic 
interests? If the latter alternative was 
overstated, might it not still be true (as 
Beard sometimes more sophisticatedly put 
it) that their view of the public welfare 
was conditioned by the experience of a 
governing class in which individual 
Fathers participated by virtue of their 
birth or wealth? These questions were 
important to me because, as one con-
siderably alienated from America's 
present, I wanted to know if there were 
men in the American past in whom I 
could believe. 

This is the kind of feeling historians 
are not supposed to have. Not only did I 
have it, however; as time went on it in-
creasingly seemed to me more honest to 
confront my feeling squarely for what 
it was, rather than pursue it in the guise of 
research about, say, the curious dis-
crepancy between the portraits of the 
revolutionary artisan in the books of Carl 
Becker and Charles Beard. 

After graduate school I taught for three 
years in a Negro women's college in 
Atlanta, Georgia. Historians are not 
supposed to be influenced by their per-
sonal experiences, but I was, profoundly. 
Here were students with a greater stake 
than I in knowing-not just entertaining 
an interpretation, but knowing-whether 
the signers of the Declaration were 
idealists who failed to carry out their full 
program or hypocritical racists who 
ki11ed Indians and bred Negroes while 
declaring that all men are equal. No doubt 
both answers were "too simple" and the 
truth was a more complicated third thing. 
But what was the truth? I did not know 
because I had not taken that question with 
sufficient seriousness to let it guide my 
own research. Incredibly, my research, 
like that of Beard, Becker and other 
Progressive historians, had tacitly assumed 
that white artisans and tenant farmers 
were the most exploited Americans of 
the late eighteenth century, overlooking 
the one-fifth of the nation which was in 
chains. 

For my Negro students it was almost 
as important to know the true character 
of their collective past as to be at ease 
with their personal histories. One brilliant 
girl described to me the moment when, 
looking at the photographs in a collection 
of slave narratives, she realized, "These 
were my forefathers." After I conven-
tionally began a survey course in 
American history with the Pilgrims, an-
other excellent student, who bad the 
courage to expose her personal past by 
inviting my family to her sharecropper 
father's home at Christmas, was also 
brave enough to ask me, "Why do you 
teach about your ancestors and not mine?" 

Next year I began the course with the 
slave ships, only to bear from a third 
student, "You are teaching me a special 
history rather than treating me like every· 
one else." 

Willy-nilly I was functioriing as 
therapist as well as historian; in reporting 
the past turned, whether I wished to or 
not, into a medium for the discovery of 
personal identity. 

At issue was not whether history, like a 
lump of dough, can be made into any 
shape one pleases. The question was rather 
that if history, like a mountain, can be 
viewed from many different standpoints, 
all equaJiy "objective," perhaps it makes 
sense to approach it from the direction 
that has most personal meaning to the 
observer. 

Meantime, I was beginning to chafe at 
the role of observer, no matter bow 
defined. Teaching in the midst of the 
civil rights movement brought home the 
aphorism (here slightly rephrased) of 
Marx's Theses on Feuerbach: "The his-
torians have interpreted the world; the 
thing, however, is to change it." 


Thus I arrived at a conception of history 
which has much in common with that of 
the eighteenth century. Just as Jefferson 
found virtues to emulate in Plutarch and 
mistakes to be avoided in the story of 
republican Rome's decline, so I would 
have the young person of our own time 
(supposing history to interest him at all) 
encounter Jefferson (or Malcolm X) with 
the question, What can I learn about bow 
to live? 

In the nineteenth century this approach 
to history came to be condemned as 
moralistic. History, Ranke and his fol-
lowers maintained, was not a lamp of 
experience to light the path ahead but a 
simple record of "bow it really happened." 
Professional historians accepted Ranke's 
attitude as the definition of objectivity. 
But as Carl Becker demonstrated in 
his Declaration Of Independence, the 
creed of wie es eigentlich gewesen pre-
supposed a belief that history "just as it 
happened" and "the existing social order" 
were "the progressive realization of God's 
purpose." The Rankian historian bad no 
need to moralize because what history had 
achieved already was satisfactory to him. 
In Becker's paraphrase, "history is God's 
work, which we must submit to, but which 
we may seek to understand in order that 
we may submit to it intelligently." This 
was objectivity only in the sense that it 
made man an object of history rather 
than a maker of it. 

It would oversimplify, of course, to 
suggest that radicals draw lessons from 
history whereas conservatives are content 
to narrate it. Among the lessons drawn 
from history by the Founding Fathers 
~ere .that economic equality was impos-
Sible 10 a populous society, that democracy 
was weakened by the growth of com-
merce, and that, since power followed 


property, it would be chimerical to attempt 
to destroy chattel slavery by political 
means. These were conservative lessons 
inasmuch as they inclined the leaders of 
the Revolution to live with inequities they 
might otherwise have protested. 

Moreover, the most influential Rankian 
of the nineteenth century was none other 
than Karl Marx. He too, like Hegel and 
Ranke, believed that ethical goals need 
not be imposed on history since they were 
immanent in it. He too, despite a youthful 
emphasis on man as historical creator, 
believed that·"freedom is the recognition 
of necessity." 

Accordingly, for someone like myself 
who was more and more committed to 
the thesis that the professor of history 
should also be an historical protagonist, 
a complex confrontation with Marxist 
economic determinism was inevitable. 
I do not pretend to be on the other side of 
this problem, certainly one of the major 
intellectual challenges of our time. But 
I have a few tentative conclusions. 

Two recent neo-Marxist statements 
on the problem of historical determinism 
and man's freedom to choose are What 
Is History? by E. H. Carr and In Search 
Of A Method by Jean-Paul Sartre. Let me 
attempt to close in on the problem by 
following the logic of these two authors. 

Carr has been much influenced by 
Collingwood, whom be describes as "the 
only British thinker in the present century 
who bas made a serious contribution to 
the philosophy of history." Carr's book 
includes such Collingwood-like observa-
tions as the following: 

The nineteenth century was, 
for the intellectuals of Western 
Europe, a comfortable period 
exuding confidence and optim-
ism. The facts were on the whole 
satisfactory; and the inclination 
to ask and answer awkward 
questions about them was cor-
respondingly weak. Ranke 
piously believed that divine 
providence would take care of 
the meaning of history if he took 
care of the facts . . . . 

And again: 

The nineteenth-century fetishism 
of facts was completed and 
justified by a fetishism of docu-
ments .... But ... no document 
can tell us more than what the 
author of the document thought 
- what he thought had hap-
pened, what he thought ought 
to happen or would happen, or 
perhaps only what he wanted 
others to think he thought, or 
even only what he himself 
thought he thought. 

Nevertheless, Carr fi.nds his way back 
from these iconoclasms not only to a 
rather conventional view of the historian's 
craft but also to an orthodox Rankian-
Marxist position that ethical judgments of 
historical events are irrelevant because 
the events themselves are determined. He 
does so by means of a most unsatisfactory 
argument. In the present moment, Carr 
appears to concede, real choice exists 
and ethical criteria are therefore pertinent. 
However, once an event has occurred it 
should be considered inevitably deter-
mined, and one who fails so to consider 
it must be suspected of wishing it had 
happened otherwise. As Carr puts the 
matter: 

... plenty of people, who have 
suffered directly or vicariously 
from the results of the Bolshevik 
victory, or still fear its remoter 
consequences, desire to register 
their protest against it; and this 
takes the form, when they read 
history, of letting their imagina-
tion run riot on all the more 
agreeable things that might have 
happened, and of being in-
dignant with the historian who 
goes on quietly with his job of 
explaining what did happen and 
why their agreeable wish-dreams 
remain unfulfilled. The trouble 
about contemporary ·history is 
"that people remember the time 
when all the options were still 
open [my italics], and find it 
difficult to adopt the attitude of 
the historian, from whom they 
have been closed by the fait 
accompli. 

With this comment Carr seeks to dispose 
of what he calls the "red herring" problem 
of historical inevitability. But if in fact I 
have the freedom to act one way or 
another, how can I turn around and 
assert, the moment after I have acted, that 
I bad to act the way I did? To borrow for 
a moment Carr's own ad hominem ap-
proach, I am inclined to think that his 
position is that of the perennial observer, 
who has never devoted his energies to 
making his "wish-dreams" real. It cannot 
be a resting-place for someone called to 
making history as well as writing it. 

Sartre's argument, if I understand it 
correctly, is similar. Beginning with the 
assertion that the abstract and schematic 
character of twentieth-century Marxism 
made necessary the creation of existen-
tialism if real human experience were to 
be grasped in its concreteness, Sartre 
concludes that as a richer Marxism, 
faithful to Marx's own complexity, 
develops, existentialism will wither away. 

The logic of a Carr or Sartre appears 
to me to disintegrate in the face of the 
twentieth century practice of revolution-
ary Marxists themselves. Every successful 
Marxist revolutionary has made his bid 
for power in defiance of what passed in his 
day for the "laws of historical develop-
ment." The Russian Mensheviks were 
right in contending that decades of 
industrial development were necessary 
before the Russian proletariat would be 
large enough to make such a revolution 
as Marx predicted; but Lenin led the 
Russian Revolution regardless. The 
supremacy of willpower and endurance-
the so-called subjective factor-to all 
environmental obstacles was so obviously 
the key factor in the Chinese Revolution 
that it has become the defining char-
acteristic of "the thought of Mao Tse-
tung." And would any one seriously 
argue that Fidel Castro's defiant handful 
in a fishing-boat was the inevitable out-
come of historical forces? 

The conception of historical causation 
by Marx (or at least by the later Marx) 
fo1lowed closely Adam Smith's model of 
the working of the capitalist market. Like 
the laissez-faire entrepreneur, so the 
actor in the Marxist historical drama 
could not correctly anticipate the outcome 
of his actions, for that outcome was the 
unplanned result of each actor's false 
anticipations. But the act of revolution is 
precisely the ability to take purposeful 
action with confidence that intended 
consequences can be achieved. The 
revolutionary transforms not only an 
oppressive society but the laws of 
development of that oppressive society. 

Despite invocation of man's future 
passage from the realm of necessity to 
the realm of freedom, Marx assigned this 
happening to the period after a revolu-
tionary seizure of power and hence did not 
fully appreciate the fact that any revolu-
tion-at least as it appears to those who 
take part in it-requires a decision by 
individual human beings that they begin to 
determine their own destinies at whatever 
cost. 

"At least as it appears to those who take 
part in it" is the heart of the matter. I 
have been trying to show that professional 
historians, whether Marxist or not, tend 
to view history from the sidelines, to 
give too little weight to that ethical 
dimension which is critical only for the 
man who must make decisions, to regard 
as historically determined what is merely 
historically past, and in sum, to do 
violence to the sense of reality of the 
historical. actor in the present moment. 

I hope I will not be misunderstood to 
believe that there are no "historical 
forces," that historical causation does not 
exist, that any one can do anything he 
wants in history at any time. The point, 
rather, is that whereas to Marx or Sartre 
human energy and striving are, as it were, 
at the service of the movement of 
impersonal historical forces, for the man 
trying to make history such forces are 
merely matters he must take into account 
in attempting to achieve his self-
determined g9als. The psychotherapist 
Victor Frankl, who himself lived through 
the concentration camps, reminds us that 
in that most oppressive of situations men 
still retained a significant ability to decide 
what would happen to them. To say the 
same thing in another way, men can be 
beasts or brothers at any level of techno-
logical development. 


How would the work of the historian be 
different if man's existential freedom to 
choose became that work's point of 
departure? 

The following are some provisional 
answers. 

1. Historians ordinarily assume that 
history can better be written about 
events at some distance in the past than 
about present happenings. No doubt this 
generalization holds good for certain 
kinds of events, sucl~ as diplomatic events, 
the sources for which tend to be kept 
secret until after the passage of many 
years. But does it apply, for example, to 
the history of the common man? 

I think not. Anyone wishing to write the 
history of the post-World War II civil 
rights movement could undoubtedly write 
it better now than five years from now, 
and better five years from now than in 
1990. The reason is that the "primary 
sources" for these events are, by and large, 
neither written nor secret but rather the 
memories of individual living persons 
which will become less accurate and 
accessible as time goes on. 

History as a chronicling of the present 
tends to be considered mere journalism, a 
debasement of what proper history should 
be, because the passage of time is 
assumed to give "perspective." Without 
wholly discounting this argument, it 
nevertheless seems to me to depend too 
much on the assumption that there is a 
single causal pattern underlying events-
a skeleton beneath the living tissue-
which will appear stark and clear in 
retrospective view. 

The historian's first duty, it seems to me, 
is the sensitive chronicling in d?pth of the 
important events of his own lifetime. 

2. Whether writing about the recent or 
distant past, the historian suggests to the 
protagonist of the present new alterna-
tives for action. Much as, with or without 
the help of therapists, all of us occasionally 
look back to our individual pasts to find 
strength for new beginnings, so with or 
without the help of historians Americans 
who wish to change their present society 
have used the past as a source for for-
gotten alternatives. The past serves us as a 
means toward that "frequent recurrence to 
fundamental principles" which the 
Virginia Bill of Rights advised. 


The difference between this use of his-
tory and that which follows from a tradi-
tional emphasis on causation may be 
illustrated with reference to tbe war in 
Vietnam. The entire American intellectual 
community has devoted itself, to an extent 
which must be without precedent, to 
becoming amateur historians of this 
conflict. Nevertheless, after all the books 
and teach-ins the simple question of 
"Why Vietnam?" remains almost as 
obscure as in February 1965. 

An economic explanation of American 
policy is difficult to demonstrate because 
American investment in Southeast Asia 
is relatively slight; but no other coherent 
hypothesis appears to have been offered. 
As to the motivation of "the other side," 
no doubt documents presently unavailable 
would help somewhat. Yet to whatever 
extent Wilfred Burchett is right in his 
ascription of the origins of the present 
war to a series of spontaneous local 
outbreaks in 1957-1959, one suspects that 
the participants themselves might be hard 
put to provide a definitive causal analysis 
of the interaction of local grievances, 
National Liberation Front leadership, and 
encouragement from Hanoi. 

Does this mean that the historian has 
nothing to offer in Vietnam? or even, in 
view of the misuse of the Munich analogy 
by the American government, that a 
solution might more readily be found if 
the habit of historical argument could 
be prescribed? I think not. Where the 
historian could be helpful, in my opinion, 
is not by deeper but still inconclusive 
research into the past, but by projecting 
alternative scenarios for the future. 

Considerable experience is available as 
to the behavior of revolutionary nationalist 
movements under varying environmental 
pressures. Without presuming to predict 
the future, historians might help American 
policy-makers to be more flexible and 
imaginative by, so to speak, prophesying 
a variety of outcomes to the present 
bloodbath. (Howard Zion's Vietnam: The 
Logic of Withdrawal exemplifies the use 
of history I have in mind.) 

Thus a second, presently unfamiliar task 
for the historian would be the projection 
of alternative futures on the basis of the 
richness of the experience of the past. 

I can delineate the tasks I am recom-
mending to historians more sharply by 
exemplifying their opposites. Here again, 
I draw negative examples from radical 
historians so as to make it clear that the 
distinctions I propose are not those where-
by radicals have traditionally defined 
themselves. 

Some time ago a student of my 
acquaintance, a member of Students for 
a Democratic Society, asked me whether 
I thought he should do graduate work 
in history. I said I did not know and 
suggested that John write to several of 
the young radical historians. He did so, 
mentioning in his letter to each that I 
had told him there were others in the field 
of American history who were much more 
optimistic than I about "carving out a 
radical approach to the field that does not 
get lost in the usual hair-splitting and 
inconclusiveness to which the profession 
is prone." 

One of John's answers was from a 
brilliant young scholar whose particular 
interest is the history of the inarticulate, as 
in the work of Albert Sobeul, George 
Rude, and E. P. Thompson abroad. His 
letter began: 

I think we know about as 
much about the role of the 
common man in American his-
tory as we would know about 
Watts if the McCone Com-
mission were our only source. 
... History has been written by 
elitists who assumed that when 
the common man acted as be did, 
he did so for irrational reasons, 
or because he was manipulated 
in some way. Much of the excite-
ment of the field to me is that all 
kinds of good things might have 
happened that we don't know 
anything about because of the 
distortions of history as it has 
been written. 

My own quarrel with this argument is 
not with its contention that history has 
been distorted but with its hope that the 
truth can be restored. Let the reader con-
sider any popular movement of our own 
day in which he has participated. For 
instance, take the Mississippi Summer 
Project of 1964. Half a dozen good books 
have already been written about it, one 
a collection of letters by student volun-
teers, a second narrating in detail a single 
volunteer's experience, a third in large 
part composed of documentary appen-
dices. In addition, the event was 
exhaustively "covered" by press and 
television. But do any of us who took 
part in that adventure seriously imagine 
that anything more than fragments of it 
will ever be set down in communicable 
form? Less than three years after the event, 
who now knows where the idea for a 
Freedom Democratic Party came from 
or what really happened at the Democratic 
Party convention at Atlantic City? 

Considerations such as these as to the 
inevitable inadequacies of contemporary 
chronicling suggest skepticism about the 
possibility of recovering "the history" of 
popular movements in the past. A few 
handbills is fortunate, perhaps some 
police records, notices of meetings from 
contemporary newspapers, the gossip of 
upper-class letter-writers, very likely 
fragmentary tax and election records: 
is it not these we rely on to reconstruct 
what happened, and are they not infinitely 
less adequate than the documentary 
record so inadequate in the case of more 
recent movements? I know from experi-
ence the temptation to fill in the gaps with 
personal "wish-dreams," and to present 
the result with a spurious air of finality. 

John received a second letter from 
another outstanding young radical 
scholar, who said in part: 

I probably disagree with Lynd 
as to what we can do. Politically, 
neither love nor violence wilt 
help us much, because we are 
beyond politics in the sense that 
this is a functionally totalitarian 
country with a liberal rhetoric, 
and reason and exemplary 
Christian behavior will not alter 
the politics of those in power. 
[But] in purely intellectual 
terms, radicals have much to do 
and it seems to me that they can 
define and analyze the nature of 
the beast we confront on a 
much higher level of sophistica-
tion and precision than we have 
up to now. 

Is this not quibbling while Rome burns? 
Is it a satisfactory definition of the 
scholar's task that he is able to say "I told 
you so" amid the ruins? Should we be 
content with measuring the dimensions of 
our prison instead of chipping away, 
however inadequately, against the bars? 


What, then, should be the historian's craft 
and the idea of history? 

I have made the assumption that what 
distinguishes the historian from other 
social scientists is not that he writes about 
the past, but that he considers things in 
process of development. "History" and 
"sociology" are not concerned with 
different objects; they are different ways of 
looking at the same object. Hence the 
historian need not be embarrased if he 
concerns himself more with the present 
and future than with the past. 

I have also made the assumption that 
the historian's business with the future is 
not to predict but to envision, to say (as 
Howard Zinn has put it) not what will be 
but what can be. The past is ransacked 
not for its own sake, but as a source of 
alternative models of what the future 
might become. 

Implicit in my discussion has been a 
third idea, that "writing history" does 
not necessarily involve "being an 
historian": in other words, that chronicling 
and envisioning are functions which might 
be as well or better done by many persons 
with part of their time rather than full-
time by a few. He who acts as well as 
watches may acquire kinds of knowledge 
unavailable to him who watches only. 
(That the converse is also true is, of 
course, a commonplace.) 

To these fundamental delimitations of 
the historian's role I should like to add 
two major qualifications. 

Human beings, at least those born into 
Judaeo-Christian cultures, appear to 
peed to formulate a collective past. 
Presumably, it will always be mainly the 
job of the historian to respond respon-
sibly to this need, in a way that does not do 
violence either to the facts of the past or 
to the human beings of the present. 

Despite the alleged anti-historicism of the 
New Left, the need for a collective past 
is felt with particular keenness today by 
young people. Many rebellious young 
Americans have profoundly mixed feelings 
when they confront our country's history. 
On the one hand, they feel shame and 
distrust toward Founding Fathers who 
tolerated slavery, exterminated Indians, 
and in all their proceedings were disturb-
ingly insensitive to values and life-styles 
other than their own. On the other hand, 
there is a diffuse sense that the rhetoric 
of the Revolution and the Civil War spoke 
then and now to hopes widespread among 
mankind. Thus in November 1965 Carl 
Oglesby. then president of Students for 
a Democratic Society, asked an antiwar 
demonstration gathered at the Washington 
Monument what Thomas Jefferson or 
Thomas Paine would say to President 
Johnson and McGeorge Bundy about the 
war in Vietnam. Thus in August 1966, 
when the House Un-American Activities 
Committee subpoenaed antiwar activists, 
the head of the Free University of New 
York issued a statement invoking the

The professor of history is among other 
things the custodian of such memories 
and dreams. 

My seoond qualification is that in a 
macrocosmic sense I believe Marxism is 
correct in its understanding of where 
humanity has been and is going. Think 
of it as a backdrop to the stage on which 
historical protagonists play their· self-
determined parts. It is nonetheless an 
essential element in the drama. The 
historian who does not grasp the fact 
that mankind, whatever else it is doin& 
is making an agonized transition from 
societies based on private property to 
societies which are not, is in my view om 
of touch with what is happening in the 
second half of the twentieth century. I 
hasten to add that these new societies mr 
not be more humane than those they 
replace. StiU, the interesting question of 
our time will appear to future historians 
as that one--namely, is a humane social 
ism possible?-rather than that which 
presently preoccupies the American 
psyche, will capitalism or socialism pre-
vail? And, from where I stand, this is 
ground for hope.
