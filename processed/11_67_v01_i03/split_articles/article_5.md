Notes on a 
Washington Weekend 
By Gerald Bruck 
These are the times for impassioned tales, 
of what it was like when I realized what 
our government really was, of how it felt 
to confront it, and Am I a revolutionary 
now, or not? Will Robert Kennedy end 
the war? Should I dynamite the induction 
center? Oh, you should have been in 
Washington the 21st. "As night fell 
Saturday, the Pentagon looked like a 
citadel under seige," wrote one James K. 
Glassman in the Harvard Crimson. Man, 
you should have been there. 

Washington's October 21 mobilization 
may indeed prove important in the history 
of America, not because courageous 
Americans confronted the warmakers, 
which they didn't, or were beaten back 
with the massed might of America, which 
they weren't, but because it tended to look 
that way to some of the few thousand 
who got all the way to the Pentagon, and 
they will spread the word. 

In past years, the movement against 
domestic racism and now the war has been 
able to trick the opposition into brutal 
and dramatic positions-behind police 
dogs, under helmets, wearing guns and 
clubs-with the end in view of swaying 
the million of glassy eyes out in tv land. 
Now the Negroes got their civil rights laws, 
but somehow it's the same old stuff and 
our war on Vietnam has grown like a 
cancer. 

So the October march was turned 
inward, it's end to radicalize its partic-
ipants, to end the fuzziness of making a 
choice in America, its justification one of 
"building a movement," the quiet folk 
will have to join us from now on. 

Robert Sherrill wrote in the Nation 
that the spontaneity of everyone doing 
their thing that weekend scared the gods 
of the press and the Pentagon, though the 
future effect of this is not predicted. 

Andrew Kopkind wrote in The New 
Statesman that maybe the inftuentials 
will be scared by this undefinable rabble 
in motion against the war, and will work 
to end the war in hope that the internal 
disorder it has conjured up will vanish 
also. Ray Mungo, who writes for the 
Liberation News Service, told me that 
this vague coalition of almost everyone 
"will be invincible" and people from all 
over will be drawn into it. James Reston, 
well, you can guess what he wrote. 

I followed the show from Friday night 
through 65 hours, went too many places, 
talked to too many people, in a way saw 
too much, to be fired with that spirit of 
revolution, and the whole event left me 
with more a premonition of doom than 
of a new era. The fact of uniformed men 
under orders which entirely cut them off 
from their surroundings was not sur-
mounted by the few effective attempts at 
dialogue that occurred, by the few soldiers 
who were swayed toward peace, by the 
patent absurdity of the entire encounter. 

I stayed with the people who stuck it 
out at the Pentagon, I had less sleep then 
they, I was hungrier, and I almost got hit 
by the marshals several times. But I lacked 
one luxury they enjoyed: they were among 
one another, and outside that little circle it 
was very lonely indeed. I especially re-
member one point Saturday night, hungry 
to the point of dizziness and freezing in 
shirtsleeves, when I tried to make my way 
to a distant parking lot and ran into lines 
of soldiers everywhere I stumbled in the 
complicated terrain surrounding the 
Pentagon. Blocking roads, behind bushes, 
everywhere there were soldiers, all under 
orders not to talk to anyone, Â·and for 
almost two hours I wandered hopelessly 
lost in this nightmare landscape peopled 
with mute, armed, statues. 

What strange sights greeted the pro-
testors as they flowed into the Pentagon 
parking lot that beautiful cigaret ad day, 
into the (as per signed agreement) liberated 
parking lot. The main platform con-
structed for the speakers attracted few 
a_rrivals and at first the crowd grew around 
the freak stage, where sorcerers, swamees, 
priests, warlocks, rabbis, gurus, witches, 
alchemists, medicine men, speed freaks 
and other holy men had gathered. Joining 
hands, they were to raise the mighty OM-
the pure, perfect, crystal sound-and 
the Pentagon would rise trembling in the 
air, and they were to shout, "We are 
free, great God almighty, Free at last!", 
weird indeed, though not quite so weird 
as the times, and for anyone who really 
wanted to freak out, the place was a few 
score yards from the main platform where 
the anti-communist Reverend Richard 
Wurmbrand, of the European Christian 
Mission, a man who turns up all over the 
place, was standing in the crows-nest of a 
twenty-foot metal arm attached to a white 
truck, attacking communism and saying 
that the U.S. was good. As a few marchers 
came over to dialogue, the reverend slowly 
descended from the sky, all the while 
waving his arms and continuing his call 
for all good men to see the danger, and 
then ripping off his shirt to display the 
marks of communist torture. Protestors 
moved in, some oozing with humble 
sincerity ("I don't like Communism either, 
but anything would be better for the 
people of Vietnam than what's going on 
now"), others bitter, angry, an impossible 
scene. 

Then down the parking lot past the 
hippie zone (where speakers were asking 
beautiful people to form protective rings 
because, tarantara, "In a few minutes, 
right over there on the grass, we will hold 
a fuck-in") past other people feeling good 
because everything was allowed, to the 
corner of the lot where several hundred 
people were confronting a line of soldiers, 
which resulted in beatings and the arrest 
of several dignitaries. Then people by 
the thousands began to climb an embank-
ment, flow out into the huge lawn before 
the front entrance of the Pentagon, and 
up the broad steps to the main plaza, 
where soldiers, trembling young M.P.'s, 
tough U.S. Marshals, and the press were 
waiting. 

Two times I saw the resistors on the 
verge of revolution, once when a marshal 
tried to haul out a more vocal protestor 
and was almost himself pulled back into 
the mob, where he well could have been 
torn apart; once when, around 4 pm, the 
crowd on the steps came to the verge of 
turning on a hopelessly outnumbered 
line of soldiers that protected a marshal 
who was smashing an unconscious 
demonstrator again and again and again 
with his club. 

Each time there was a quick, fearsome 
breaking point, and the crowd held back. 
abandoning its solidarity with the cap-
tured, content with letting a Progressive 
Labor Party man throw beer cans and 
marbles at the soldiers from four rows 
back. 

The young man who was getting so 
badly beaten was eventually tossed over 
a low wall into the arms of waiting 
marshals, and I followed them up to the 
vans. 

"What's your name? Your ~?" 
I asked. He wasn't interested in anything, 
temporarily beaten into submission; he 
and a friend were thrown into a van, one 
of the marshals coming close to strangling 
the friend for no apparent reason. 

Meanwhile-it was 5:10 in the after-
noon-a most unusual scene was taking 
place on the steps. The crowd and the 
tension had lessened a little, and the 
soldiers in the middle, between the crowds, 
had more space to point their guns, and 
a young man with flowers in his hair 
walked in front of them and stuck flowers 
into the barrels of the guns. He got away 
with it at first, and the soldiers pointing 
their guns for dear life looked impos-
sibly ridiculous with flowers coming out 
of the barrels. Other soldiers, now alert 
to the potential embarrassment, yanked 
their guns away from the threatening ftora 
with ferocious, mechanical gestures, and 
they looked even more absurd. 

To protestors driven to desperation 
by any and all form of effort to stop the 
war, this scene may have held some 
satisfaction. Perhaps it made a few 
soldiers feel very silly, but they were 
"in a whole different world," as one young 
GI who had helped defend the warmakers 
explained to me two days later during a 
misty morning encounter at Occoquan 
prison, where most of the arrested resistors 
were being held and "processed" before 
commissioners. 

This particular GI made a habit of 
calling his mother once a week, and what 
should he have found out on last night's 
call but that his brother was behind bars 
for activity at the Pentagon. 

"I figure forty per cent of the guys are 
against the war," be said, "but when you're 
in the army you're not supposed to have 
any feelings, which is why I guess I 
should stop talking to you. 

"But lots of guys figure the demon-
strators were pretty much right, though 
they didn't get it across very well; they 
could be really insulting.'' 

At 5:20 came that rush on corridor 
seven of the Pentagon, right next to the 
main entrance. A handful of people 
managed to make it through, only to 
find the inside lined with soldiers and 
MPs, and a few came boomeranging out 
the door and back into the crowd just in 
time to join their friends who were being 
cleaned off the steps by cossack-like 
marshals. 

As more soldiers came onto the scene 
and things went back under control, the 
steps leading to the main plaza or "Mall" 
in front of the Pentagon emptied, and 
except for a group off at one of the 
approaches to the left, most of the action 
took place here.

On either side of the point where the 
main steps reached the Mall were two, long 
wooden platforms on wheels. They were 
known as "low boys," and the Pentagon 
had put them there for reporters and 
camera men to stand on. In time, the 
soldiers pressed closer and closer until a 
clump of several hundred demonstrators 
were crammed together between the 
platforms. It was this group, aided by 
reinforcements that were allowed to come 
up the steps, that remained until Sunday 
night. Off to the left was a bigger area 
dotted with small bonfires, twenty or 
thiry people clustered around each, that 
gradually emptied and had been reclaimed 
by soldiers by Sunday morning. 

As night fell, folk began to burn their 
signs and leaflets to keep warm, "supply 
lines" started bringing in water and food, 
and an angry group over on the left got 
hit with tear gas, while Pentagon informa-
tion officers were telling newsmen first 
that no tear gas had been fired, and later 
that it must have been thrown by the 
demonstrators themselves, a story so out 
of time with what I and other reporters 
had seen that it almost commanded 
respect. A long line of soldiers was 
advancing around one corner of the 
Pentagon, sheathed bayonets fixed, ad-
vancing with a dancelike step and 
trampling the tearful, stray girls who tried 

to block the advance by sitting down in 
their path. 

The situation was becoming more 
unreal, the kind of thing that set some 
people to wondering about themselves and 
the whole world. Â·'Who am I?" asked 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense 
for public affairs Richard Fryklund to 
assembled newsmen inside the Pentagon 
at 8:10. Fryklund was asking questions 
to which he thought the newsmen would 
like answers. He answered that he was 
Richard Fryklund. 

"Do you know what the situation is 
immediately outside?" one reporter asked, 
adding that he was "just curious." 

Fry.Jund said he didn't but everyone was 
"welcome to go outside and look." 

The public affairs people were generally 
most efficient, as when information officer 
Dania! Z. Henkin assembled the press at 
12:45 that night to say "I just want to 
let you know that I'm still here." The 
deadline for the Sunday papers had long 
passed and since few reporters were left 
outside the marshals egged the soldiers 
toward the low boys, on the first major 
mop-up of the night. Rifle butts came 
down on people with that sickening crack-
like sound, and the resistors several rows 
back began to throw things at the soldiers, 
which made it worse for those up front; 
they were screaming in fear and anger, 
and the cry came over the loudspeaker: 
"medical person needed, medical person 
needed." A few people cried out to the 
camera men still stationed on the low boys 
to keep the lights on, it inhibited the 
marshals, but they said no, the batteries 
might wear out, they only report the news, 
and so it went. 

The troops stopped pushing a little 
around 2 o'clock. The resistors had been 
forced into a small, roundish area at the 
head of the steps near the left low boy. 
For the rest of that long, cold night and 
all of Sunday until midnight when the 
game was up, the soldiers and marshals 
engaged in a slow war of attrition, carrying 
people away one by one, without advance 
notice, fraying everyone's nerves, getting 
the left-over press mad at the demon-
strators for keeping them up and in one 
case away from the Sunday football game. 

Many of the people in that small knot of 
a few hundred believed they were some-
how effectively resisting the government, 
but they were playing at Uncle Sam's 
discretion. Still, it wasn't easy to stay there 
aU night. 

At I :30 a.m. Sunday morning, the 
marshals off to the left on the Mall still 
weren't satisfied, "I'm hoping someone's 
gonna put their head in the way when I 
bring this down," one said as he stroked 
his club. Things were going well at 1:45, 
real well, even time for fancy maneuvers. 
Every fifth man should be going out, jour 
of five should be going in, at safe guard. 
At this point a young protestor with long 
hair and beads around his neck came up 
to a marshal. 

"Can I stay here without being 
arrested?" 

"You'll be told to move," says the 
marshal slowly, like a cat eyeing a kitten. 

"Yaas, you'll be able to get out." 

"Good, you sound like a real good guy. 
One guy messed up a girl pretty bad, but 
I guess there's some bad ones in each 
group, it's no reflection on you." 

"Yaas," he says with a quiet grin, 
"yaas, you'll be able to move before 
someone latches on to you ... " 

Back at the encampment, a speaker is 
forecasting tear gas, and "we should all 
stick together because if we can stick it 
out until tomorrow morning we've won, 
we've got control, we've beaten them ... " 

At 2: 14, someone says that "you soldiers 
are always welcome to our water,'' and it 
worked both ways because several hours 
later, in the cold and just before dawn, the 
soldiers emptied their canteens on the 
mall, and the water ran down into the 
squatters. 

Far away, at the left extreme of the 
plaza, a pathetic scene was taking place. 
A Puerto Rican from California had lost 
his wallet, it had $225 in it, all the money 
he owned, and he was pleading with the 
soldiers, three of whom had leveled their 
weapons at his chest, to let him back into 
the liberated zone. He was staring tearfully 
at a Negro soldier, and he touched his 
gun in a show of respect. 

"Get your damn hands off my rifle." 

"How will I get back to California, 
mannnn? Mannnnn? ... Let me have a 
chance to look for it, I not find it I go 
back ... call the FBI, maybe they help 
me ... or something, or something. Help 
me, I help all people. Tell me why it's 
bad? 

A long pause as he stares soulfully at 
the black soldier. "Man, I don't work, 
I can't find it." 

The marshal gave an order, the three 
aimed rifles clicked. 

" Go ahead, kill me, why look at me? 
... I leave you my draft card, okay? ... 
Before I wanted to go in the army, but 
now I don't think the army so nice." 

He sat down on the ground, and the 
three rifle barrels followed him. He pressed 
his head against the Negro soldier's gun. 

"Stand back," cried the trooper and 
shoved hard on his weapon. 

The man slowly got up, starting at the 
soldiers. "You devils, you animals," he 
said, and slowly walked into the darkness. 

"He's lucky he got away," said the 
Negro soldier. "I was just about to bash 
him." 

. Meanwhile, one of the speakers at the 
main outpost was announcing that "we 
are standing here resisting the greatest 
power ever known to man, and we have 
resisted it for hours and hours and hours. 
Your humanity does not necessitate that 
we all go out like sheep .... " 

Then someone suggested that the 
soldiers were arresting them illegally, and 
that they ought to arrest the soldiers. A 
marshal stepped onto a low boy. "Hey, 
that's the big bomber," yelled a resistor, 
"the one who beat us up this afternoon. 
Hey, man, we have your picture, we're 
gonna get your ass someday." 

Another hour passed. It was very cold, 
people were leaving, and a speaker was 
saying that "it's difficult terrain out there, 
lots of army out there, it's best not to 
dribble off .... " 

Inside the press room, a couple of 
information officers were analyzing the 
rabble at the gates. The consensus was that 
they needed defumigators, and one of the 
more civic minded said he wanted "to give 
them -all a bath." 

As the clock ticked on, they covered a 
range of subjects and displayed all the 
while a tendency to immediate consensus. 
"If we could get the goddam tv to be a 
little more responsible, we could save 
half our problems," said one amidst 
general nodding. "I hear this is true of 
Newark and Detroit; the tv crews staged 
half the action. If they got somewhere and 
nothing was doing, they'd get someone to 
turn a car over and burn it." 

As for the Vietniks, "I'd like to take 
all those punks, put 'em in an airplane, give 
them a chute-let's be fair about it-and 
drop 'em over Hanoi." 

"They ought to appreciate this country," 
said a colleague. "They haven't seen any-
thing-~stern Europe, communist-
dominated countries." 

"No matter how legitimate it may be, 
they're being used." 

"There are well known communists 
in the leadership." 

Down the endless corridors of the 
Pentagon, the officer escorted two joum 
alists toward the exit for the parking lot. 
You can image what would have hap pent 
if five or ten thousand of them had got 
inside this building. We would have had 
to hunt them out like fucking rats. Woul 
have been hard, too; he had seen the 
vanguard of the charge on the doors, the 
rush toward corridor seven-It was led 
by this colored boy, man I've never seen 
such maniacs, he was yelling 'Kill'em Ki 
'em!' And he had real long hair, in ever) 
direction, like a gorilla. 

At six a.m. a cleaning machine was 
driving crazily up and down the mall, 
erasing the scourge of the resistors' 
garbage. Only 300 resistors Â·were left, the 
group between the low boys. And it had 
indeed been a long night. 

"Linda!" came an angry yell at a girl 
huddled in a sleeping bag. 

"It's crumbling, people aren't putting 
up any resistance," someone whispered. 

" ... A new social democracy is cornin 
on," said the speaker, " ... let me ask 
everyone who is leaving to change their 
minds and stay ...... please stay, and 
fight the fucking paratroopers!" 

"If you want to use the speaker, use 
appropriate language!" said someone. 

"It's cold" said the speaker, "everyone 
is cold, we're tired ... " People were yellin! 
and complaining. 

The sun rose, someone read poetry, but 
when he got to the one about children 
scarred with napalm, the resistors couldn' 
stand it, they were scared of the soldiers 
who towered above them. 

" ..... residue of jelly ....... " 

"No, no, stop it." 

The soldiers bad pressed closer, and the 
marshals went through the line and d0\\
1 
the steps behind the marchers. They 
began to smash bottles with their clubs, 
kick apart the bonfires. 

''I'm so proud of you committed ..... . 
said the speaker. 

"Yeah," said a committed to me, 
"committed to a hospital, you can see 
it .... the marshals are coming in, they'tl 
all around, God, this is it." 

But it wasn't it, and soon two camera 
crews were back in the bright morning 
air. A copy of the Sunday Washington 
Post was passed around, (it underplayed 
the violence they had seen committed 
against them) and someone announced thâ¢ 
the press would have to end. A speaker ga 
up and delivered a diatribe against the 
press, but someone else challenged biro: 
"it was bad public relations," he said, 
"with the press watching"; and they alma' 
came to blows amid various cries of 
"no, no." 

"It's the marshals who are beating us," 
one girl said. "The army troops are fair~ 
decent and we even gave one a cookie." 

As the sun rose and warmth returned 
to the land, so also the press, and around 
11 o'clock the soldiers began to cart awâ¢1 
more resistors. "Wow, they even give us 
erotic show," said one network correspott 
dant as .he looked at a couple that had 
been momentarily abandoned by the 
soldiers, clutching one another in the 
middle of the plaza. 

" It makes me so sad I want to cry," 
he continued to a colleague, "sad each 
time I see one of them go by. These 
hippies ... you know, my son is a hippie. 

"They just don't understand what's 
happening, not that there's anything wrolll 
with what they're doing, it's just that 
they're going to be marked with it for 
the rest of their lives because tbatâ¢s the

way society is." He had been to Vietnam, 
he hated communism, those protestors 
were lucky they were in a free country. 

Hour after hour they sat, starting a 
brief teach-in aimed at the soldiers, 
Â·nÂ· listening to girls sing songs. Night falls 
t. 
again, the cold returns. The resistors are 
nt more organized now, they have more 
â¢t 
blankets, they are sitting in neat rows, 
ad agreements have been concluded with the 
nll General Services Administration that those 
who go to jail will be carried away gently. 
he Some would rather fight, some aren't 
d 
sure if they ought to jeopardize their jobs 
en 
by going to jail, but things are neater, 
Ki cleaner, more antiseptic. 

I went into the Pentagon at 9:15p.m. 
Â·ry 
to pick up some press releases, and the 
l, 
officers are watching Moms Mayberry, 
he 
little Sony televisions on their desks. 
Walking down the halls, photographs of 
Vietnam ve.terans who have received the 
:1 
Congressional Medal of Honor, out the 
tg 
front entrance. Lines of soldiers, one to 
I. 
each side made a rigid turn to allow me 
passage, the steps were brilliant in the 
floodlight. A thousand hard hats glistened 
e 
in the cold light, a lonely girl's voice 
ne 
drifted out from where the last cluster 
Hnl of resistors sat, awaiting midnight. 

Let me tell you 'bout the times I've 
had ..... 

Time goes slowly by, more songs, H ey, 
ut 
let's really hear it for the chick, says a 
young man, someone claps his hands. 

At 11, I went inside again, to watch the 
s 
news on tv, (But those there would claim 
that much of the violence was directed 
:in' against the soldiers and marshals ordered 
to stand their ground. Many were struck 
tht with rocks, beer bottles, and cans), 

gave up and went outside, where the 
)\\1 soldiers were rearranging themselves in 
;, 
complex patterns, and someone was saying 
on the megaphone, "and make sure we're 
.. ' peaceful as we get arrested, regardless of 
hose what the American press with all its dis-
down tortions says .... " The soldiers were 
with preparing to haul the remnants of the 
resistors away, one by one, despite the 
.. ' counsel of a newsman that they simply 
hose down the plaza and get the show over 
with. 

At 11: 10, several resisters pull out draft 
y'tl cards, while a nearby newscaster help-
a fully interprets their actions to his 
o audience. "I saw a number of youngsters 
d burn what they said to be their draft 
tb- Cards, but I saw one holding a dollar bill, 
gG and another his social security card." 

e At 11: 17, the forces of Jaw and order 
ro: enter into a set of extremely complex 
h maneuvers and even more complex 
,, formations, a partial map of which looks 
.irll like the Cretan labyrinth in my notebook. 
And at 11:29.17, alt. colonel who looks 
like Steve Canyon clicks on a microphone, 
and speaks these words: 

The dem-on-stra-tion in which you are 
par-tic-ipating ennnds at midnight. 
I re-peat, the demonstration .... 

is enormously cold, the Mall is bathed 
â¢n brilliant light, the soldiers stationed at 
od
their textbook positions. 

The ag-ru-ment signed by your leaders 
and by the General Services Administra-
tion ex-pires at that time. All persons 
who wish to leave vol-un-tar-ily can 
board busses on the Mall. Those busses 
will go to the Memorial bridge. Those 
who wish to take those busses should 
move to the West end of the sidewalk. 

There is a roar in the distance, the 
military vans parked in the neat rows sud-
ie. ~ 
start up and drive a few feet 
orward, making a passage in the 
onl labyrmtb, and presto/ busses come roaring 
arOUnd the side of the pentagon . 

.r 
Those demonstrat-ors ... 

be 
4nyon bas assumed a disapproving tone. 

..... who do NOT leave voluntarily 
by midnight will be arr-est-ed and taken 
to a fed-eral de-tent-ion center. A.ull 
dem-on-stra-tors are urged to abide by 
the permit. 

I say to you again, ..... 

And he goes through the talk again. Thirty 
or so resistors chose the busses; haggard, 
shaggy they crossed through the forces 
of law and order, immigrants whose num-
ber had been called at Ellis Island. It 
seems to get colder every minute. The 
light begins to hurt my eyes and my head 
is coming apart from 60-odd hours of 
wakefulness. 

. ..... federal detention center. We 
urge demonstrators to abide by the , .. 

A reporter and a helmeted officer 
recognize one another, they clasp hands. 
They are old friends from Saigon. "Got 
back in time to ma.ke Detroit," says the 
milit 'ry man. 

"Hey, I was in Detroit too," enthuses 
the reporter. 

"CPM 1 to Baler 19," says a soldier to 
his walkie-talkie. 

"Midnight," cries Steve Canyon. The 
demonstrators, one by one, are carried 
from the Mall toward the waiting vans, 
put in, the doors close, and the vans drive 
away. 

The camera men turn the lights on and 
film the dense garbage that marks the 
now freed but once liberated zone, a few 
soldiers walk around in it, kicking at this 
and that.
