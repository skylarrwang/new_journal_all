To the Editors: 
What Michael Lerner apparently forgets 
m~ in his essay ("Death at an Early Age: 
of 
aru 
!Cia! 
ch 
s 
Report from the Graduate School," 
October 29) is that. a graduate education, 
no matter what other goals it may have, 
is designed primarily to give professional 
competence in a scholarly discipline. 
It is therefore by definition "academic." 
It is also at times tedious. But if a student 
finds the materials of scholarship "special-
ized irrelevancies,'' this may not be a 
sign so much that they are irrelevant 
(many people do not think they are) as 
that the student might do well to look for 
a new profession. 

I agree with Mr. Lerner's assessment 
of his own essay when be writes, "One 
person carrying a graduate load cannot 
make a good survey of what is wrong and 
what changes should be made." But then 
what is Mr. Lerner doing for us? The 
answer is interesting, I think. There is an 
excess and disorder in his essay that makes 
what might have been an intelligent 
critique seem more like a frustrated com-
plaint. Instead of a coherent survey, we 
have what looks more like a catalogue of 
grievances. True, many of the criticisms 
in this essay desperately need to be made 
and acted on. But Mr. Lerner fails to see 
that our work in the Graduate School is 
not necessarily the same thing as our life 
in New Haven, and he makes the mistake 
of foisting the dissatisfactions (not to 
say horrors) of the latter on the former. 

As a graduate student, I think that with 
a little wit it is possible to postpone an 
early death-at least until middle age.

I wish that Michael Lerner's "Death at an 
Early Age" might bring the Graduate 
School back to life. I wish that the call to 
work together, to organize across depart-
mental lines and effect real reform might 
be achieved. I wish the dead could be 
roused so easily. 

But isn't graduate scbool our just fate? 
Ever since we were dragged into our 
first school room we have added to our 
reservoir of arbitrary facts. We have 
"made progress," each year advancing 
to the next grade with more competence 
!'ecause we were more specialized in our 
tnterest and hence more sure of ourselves. 
Now that we have grown up absurd, is 
there any hope that further academic 
work will be any less absurd? 

Higher education will not be any better 
until it becomes a truly worthwhile intel-
lectual experience. We must break down 
barriers between departments and with.in 
departments before we can communicate 
With each other. We must study relevancies 
before we will have anything to say to 
each other. For the moment, Mr. Lerner 
has written the appropriate epitaph for 
the srad school: "It's merely academic!'

'Tis Pity
**Author: Jonathan B. Conant**

~· Giamatti comes close to the truth in 
has analysis (October 29) of 'Tis Pity She's 
• Whore when he says that the "focus was 
blurred throughout." The production was, 
I think, rather bad because of this "blurred 
focus", and there were two reasons for it. 

The first is easy, and is to be inferred 
from Mr. Giamatti's article: Lydia Fisher 
is quite good as Hippolita, doing well 
things which she should never have been 
asked to do-dying on that precipitous 
platform being the most outrageous. But 
what of the so-called "nucleus" of profes-
sional actors? The most charitable view 
is that their presumed talent is obscured 
by the inept directing. I did not in any 
case feel that the caliber of the acting was 
any higher than it ever has been in Drama 
School productions. The School has 
always had brilliant technicians and dull 
actors, in general. But when the students 
seem to be as good as their professional 
mentors, what defense is there for the new 
structure of Mr. Brustein's "conserva-
tory"? All this by way of extension on 
Mr. Giamatti's commentary. 

The second reason for the lack of focus 
is far more central. In the program we 
are asked, in effect, to come and watch the 
new Drama School play a leading role in 
the advancement of theatrical experi-
mentation. The most annoying char-
acteristic of 'Tis Pity is precisely the 
attempt at experimentation. But was 
there really anything on the stage that we 
can call new and at the same time im-
portant? Are any new steps taken? Was 
( 
.. 
the last bloody scene, for example, any 
different from any other portrayal of a 
last bloody scene? It may seem a small 
matter, but the staging of such a scene is 
most difficult. Its only purpose is to clear 
the stage of actors so the play can end. 
Mr. Haigh does nothing new here. He 
seems to believe that the tragedy of the 
play is all this death on the stage, and he 
gives us every dull and agonizing minute 
of it. Surely here is a place for experimen-
tation. 

But he relies on the superficialities of 
scenery, light, and costumes. The stage 
may look striking, but it bas very little real 
acting area. This fact, combined with Mr. 
Haigh's lack of imagination in placing 
his actors, makes for a bad physical 
experience. The light is full of pretty 
colors, to be sure, but it is inadequate for 
illumination in many scenes-there is a 
dark pocket in the dead center of the 
stage, under the overhang; Giovanni 
delivers one of his later speeches from a 
pointed and precarious box, stage-right, in 
utter darkness, when a move of two feet 
would put him in light; and all of the 
entrances and exits, except those through 
the central areaway, are impeded by steep 
inclines and are necessarily cumbersome. 

Finally, the costumes. Period dress has a 
kind of magnitude which this play needs 
very badly, and it adds verisimilitude-a 
necessary ingredient if the viewer is .to 
extrapolate from the play into his own 
times. This extrapolation is supposed to 
be the reason for the "timeless" costumes. 
In the first place, they are not timeless: 
they pander to a current fad, most espe-
cially in the masque, which seems to be 
"happening" for its own sake, and not to 
further the cause of the play. Secondly, 
they are funny and, being funny, distract-
ing. Thirdly, they are in no way justified 
by the production. If the words are to be 
obscured they must be replaced by some-
thing else which carries the message. 

These superficial "experiments" do not 
do this. 

In fact, this experimentation, contribut-
ing nothing to the play except irrelevant 
visual interest, and detracting seriously 
from a necessary attention to the words, 
explains Mr. Giamatti's perception of a 
blurred focus. Behind all of the finery there 
is really no play at all. I wonder if this is 
Mr. Brustein's understanding of experi-
mentation?
