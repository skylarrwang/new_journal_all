Yale Draft 
Refusal 
Over 250 students have signed the Yale 
Draft Refusal Pledge. However, difficulties 
in assembling mailing lists have prevented 
our contacting many in the Yale community. 
If you wish to sign, simply fill out the state-
ment below. Faculty members with extended 
draft liability are also invited to sign. 
We need money for printing and advertising 
expenses. Mail cards and contributions to:

We are men of draft age who believe that the 
United States is waging an unjust war in Vietnam. 
We cannot, in conscience, participate in this war. We 
therefore declare our determination to refuse 
induction as long as the United States is fighting in 
Vietnam.

FAUST (1928) by F. W. Murnau 
With Emil Jannlngs 
Perhaps the greatest film of the German silent 
era, Murnau's classic ranges from the immensity 
of an epic to the intimacy of a love story in its 
unique handling of the famous legend.
