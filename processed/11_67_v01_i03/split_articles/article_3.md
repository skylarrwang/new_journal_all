We discussed the meaning of Hunger 
and Thirst, its style, its shape, my part. 
I understood him; having been as close to 
the work for as long as I was, its 
significance could not have been totally 
lost on me. Lee Starnes had been right in 
deciding that the character Tripp bears no 
relation to Samuel Beckett. This wide-
spread misinterpretation was the doing of 
an early reviewer, and has been dupli-
cated almost without fail ever since. In 
fact, the play originally had no direct 
references to Brecht; the other clown's 
name was changed to Brechtoll simply to 
add a little extra bite when the play 
opened in DUsseldorf, Germany. Making 
Tripp a figure for Beckett would be 
ridiculous; Tripp is the pious Catholic 
in extremis, Beckett was born An Irish 
Protestant, and has not sipce become any 
more pious. 


This line of conversation naturally led 
to the character Jean B~renger, who 
appears in several Ionesco plays and is 
often described as Ionesco's alter ego. He's 
not that, strictly speaking. Jean has a lot 
of Eugene in him-but he has his own 
existence, too. Besides, he changes a 
little in each play. Still and all, Eugene 
feels awfully close to Jean. 


We went on about critics in general. 
Fairly uncharitably. They write that his 
themes are unconscious. Not so, says he. 
He has written another episode for 
Hunger and Thirst, which will soon be 
published. He'll keep writing new ones, 
continuing the story. If you want to 
produce the play, just pick your three 
favorites. 


Ionesco agreed with most of Prof. 
Jacques Guicharnaud's comments on the 
play in the original Friday last year. The 
third episode, according to the author, 
is "an anti-Brechtian play in the style of 
Brecht." 


I described Silliman College's contro-
versial production of The Bald Soprano 
last year, and the various violences that 
the director, Bart Teush, committed on the 
text. Ionesco listened. He questioned, be 
puzzled, and be laughed. Surprisingly, he 
seemed disturbed that the actors had been 
watching the television in the first part of 
the play; when he wrote it, almost twenty 
years ago, one would hardly have expected 
to find a TV in a typically British home. 


I pointed out that one doesn't worry about 
anachronisms when one puts on Ionesco. 
Ionesco was content. 


We talked. And talked. Without order 
sometimes. We leaned in to work out 
intricacies; we leaned back to laugh, I got 
drunk. 


The question of literary influence carne 
up. Ionesco said that while the present 
masters of European drama do keep 
interested and informed about each 
other's work, this could not properly be 
called an influence; it's too superficial. 
Kafka, for example, did influence Ionesco 
-but Ionesco didn't begin to feel this 
influence until a dozen years after reading 
him. 


We spoke about the other playwrights of 
modern France, and the productions of 
their plays then appearing in Paris; we 
had seen many of the same plays. We had 
even been at A vi goon at about the same 
time-but I bad been attending the 
Festival (the most important summer 
event in French theatre) and Ionesco bad 
just been walking around the town looking 
for the narrowest streets. He had been 
:nvited to the Festival to act the part of 
the father in Philippe Adrien's La Baye, 
but he had declined because of worry 
about his health. We touched on Beckett, 
Genet, Sartre, de Ghelderode, Arrabal, 
Adamov, and Obaldia, among others. He 
feels that the .. absurdist" revolution of 
the early fifties was the work of Beckett, 
Pinter, and himself-but actually, he 
admits, he is not really familiar with 
Pinter's plays; only a few of them have 
been translated, and still fewer have been 
produced in Paris. He seems to feel much 
closer to Samuel Beckett, though. They 
don't see each other too often, but seem to 
keep in touch. lonesco admires him 
immensely. 


Strange. I find myself talking about 
Ionesco in the third person while talking 
to him across his coffee table. He doesn't 
seem to notice that it's a bit ridiculous; 
he doesn't seem to mind. Sometimes he 
takes it up, more often he speaks of the 
theatre of Ionesco in the first person. 
Sometimes what he says would appear 
immodest or downright boastful, but 
something in his manner announces that 
matters of pride are fairly irrelevant with 
Ionesco. At moments he may be touchy 
and defensive, at other moments self-
denigrating, but finally he ends up 
dispersing the whole problem with that 
laugh. In his Victims of Duty the poet 
Nicolas d'Eu announces, in effect, "No, I 
don't write at all, and I'm proud of it. It 
would be useless; we already have Ionesco 
and Ionesco. That's enough." The man 
asks to be laughed at, and with. 


A couple of times my French breaks 
down. I try to ask him a complex question 
and he doesn't get what I'm driving at. 
I try again and he answers me in the most 
elementary terms. I change the subject 
and feel foolish. Very sobering. 


We talked a great deal about politics. I 
hadn't expected that a playwright so 
opposed to engage theatre should be so 
conscious of it-but it all fit into place, 
eventually. It seems that he has been 
haunted by the idea of totalitarianism. 
World War II is never far from his 
thoughts, and its monoliths pervade his 
dreams. His writing is often a purgation of 
these nightmares, as it was for Kafka. 
Arrabal is similarly tortured by the 
father-figure of his native Spain, but 
Ionesco would have him give even freer 
rein than he does already to his various 
panics. Through subjective theatre, 
Ionesco feels, one can reach a high degree 
of universality. 


He is soon to have an article pi.Jblished 
suggesting that Americans not be so 
sensitive to foreign criticism--especially 
French. De Gaulle, he says, represents and 
leads that considerable faction of 
Frenchmen who resent the fact that the 
United States bas twice saved France, 
and so ignore this fact and blame the 
U.S. for anything and everything. Such 
countries, as be sees it, not only force 
America to stand alone in defense of the 
entire free world, cavilers included, 
against totalitarianism, but also are mak-
ing Americans doubt that their stand is 
just. Vietnam, he readily admits, is 
bothersome to the extreme--but be 
doesn't know what else the U.S. could 
have done. 


We touch on Yale, contemporary 
America, my life, my plans. My immedi-
ate plan was a 4:00 flight back to the 
States. Two hours away. I would need 
lunch, n'est-ce pas? And so came lunch, 
in several quite agreeable courses. Just the 
three of us, me at the head of the table. 
Ionesco worried about his diet, his liver, 
his medicine. He looked at his plate help-
lessly; his wife noticed, got up and 
toddled around behind me, and cut his 
meat. He put his broken hand on the 
table and grumbled disgustedly, "I'm 
just like an infant." B~renger! 


This and that were discussed. Mme 
lonesco entered in a great deal. She's 
very pleasant. She keeps the files: reviews, 
letters, photos and aucb. She keeps things 
going. Her first language was Rumanian. 
In a fit of astonishing largesse and benevo-
lence, I congratulated her on her 
practically perfect French accent. Perhaps 
a fit of whiskey and red wine. 


After the main course Mme Ionesco 
stepped on a button she had plugged in 
under the table before the meal, and a 
buzzer rang in the kitchen for the maid. 
After a few minutes she buzzed again. 
After a few more minutes she cleared the 
table herself and brought on the cheese 
and yogurt. Around peach time the 
doctor came to give Ionesco his daily shot. 
It was over. I gulped down the peach 
and stood. If I were a Pataphysician-a 
follower of the non-philosophy of the 
pre-Absurdist dramatist J arry-1 would 
have had to take my leave of him bowing, 
walking backwards, and calling him 
"your transcendency," because of his 
high rank in the cult. I decided it would 
be better not to. They thanked me much 
for coming. I tried my best to say the right 
things. 


I went out the multi-locked door, took 
the lift down, and ran for a cab to Orly. 
JONATHAN MARKS, a senior in Yale 
College and vice-president of the Yale 
Dramat, played a leading role last spring 
in the Dramat's production of Ionesco's 
Hunger and Thirst. Marks visited lonesco 
in August.
