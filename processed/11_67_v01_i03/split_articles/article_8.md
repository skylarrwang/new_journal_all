of music theory, who serves as assistant 
conductor of the orchestra, conducted, 
attd Bruce Myers, a Yale junior, played 
the solo part. Both clearly knew what they 
were doing. The second movement was 
especially effective; this movement is 
extremely simple in outline and gives 
neither the soloist nor the orchestra any 
place to hide their inadequacies. The 
performance was consistently clean, clear 
and beautiful and showed both careful 
preparation and sound musical insight. 

It's a shame the concert was so poorly 
attended. Of course the Whiffenpoofs were 
singing that night; as this reporter entered 
Sprague Hall huge crowds of people 
(most-the parents of "Ppents" weekend) 
were moving down College Street toward 
Woolsey Hall. Even so, the orchestra 
should have been able to attract a larger 
audience than the hundred-or-so people 
who showed up. The orchestra's difficulty 
in competing with the Whiffenpoofs is 
probably symbolic, for in its three years 
of existence, the orchestra bas not yet 
managed to become a Yale institution. 

Part of the problem seems to be a lack 
of the sort of instant nostalgia on which 
the singing groups can capitalize, and 
part seems to stem from the presence of an 
active Music School at Yale. Yale's 
musical life must be as intense as that of 
any school in the country; the variety of 
excellent free concerts sponsored directly 
or indirectly by the Music School is 
amazing. 

Nevertheless, the Yale Symphony really 
fills a need in the Yale community. lllf 
because Yale has such a great wealth ct 
professional and semi-professional m 
amateur music often bas a great deal 
trouble getting off the ground. Yale's 
recent changes in admissions policy set 
to have created an especially impressive 
body of undergraduate musicians. Un 
the Yale Symphony was organized 
undergraduate musical life at Yale was 
strictly ad hoc affair. The orchestra, in 
addition to providing performing 
experience for its members, has rapidly 
become a sort of central clearing hoUSt 
for undergraduate classical music and 
has increasingly tended to spawn tern 
rary or semi-permanent chamber music 
groups and chamber orchestras. It bas 
provided some of the better undergrad 
soloists with a chance to play concertos 
with a real orchestra. 

This is not to say that the orchestra 
strictly an undergraduate organization. 
At its first concerts in 1965-66 substan 
numbers of Music School students bel 
out by playing with the orchestra, and 
although since then the orchestra has 
more and more been able to rely on a 
dependable body of undergraduate 
musicians, many individual members of 
the Music School, both faculty and 
students, have maintained a lively 
interest in the orchestra. Beyond this d 
orchestra has sought instrumentalists, 
especially string players, who are stude1 
in the graduate and professional scbod 
outside the M usic School. 

Most of the orchestra's problems, thl 
seem to depend for their solutions on
