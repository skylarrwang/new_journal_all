**Page number(s): 3-4**

I arrived at 11 a.m. on the dot, just as we 
had planned on the phone. Mustered up 
all the coffee-stoked courage I had, and 
pushed the bell. Long wait. No sound. I 
looked around. The top floor of a rather 
high-class Paris apartment-house. Sun-
light. Under the doorbell, their nameplate: 
IONESCO. 

Then, finally, footsteps down the hall. 
The sound of the lock being opened from 
within. Then another lock. Two more. 
Finally the door swung open, and a very 
small woman stood in front of me in her 
bedclothes, squinting from the light. 

She had just awakened. 

"Madame Ionesco?" 

"Oui, Monsieur." 

"I'm here to speak with your husband. 
We have an appointment for 11 o'clock." 

She looked puzzled. I tried to clear 
things up. 

"Oh," she said, the light finally dawning, 
"you're the comedien! Weren't you 
supposed to come next Tuesday?" 

Damn, thought I. It was my last day in 
Europe; I couldn't have made it for 
Tuesday. She hovered for a minute 
between sending me away and inviting me 
in. Then: 

"Come in and sit down. I'll see if my 
husband can speak with you." 

A nondescript green armchair. The 
living room is filled with modern art, 
abstract, yet it is not itself a modern room. 
Ionesco appears at one door, disappears 
through another. The maid walks through, 
looks around disapprovingly, and also 
disappears. 

Then Ionesco comes in to greet me. 
His pajama top is white, his pajama 
bottoms are purple. His robe is yet 
another purple. We are friends from the 
start. 

"So glad you were able to get hold of 
me," he said. "But weren't you supposed 
to come on Tuesday?" 

We retired to the study and sat down to 
chat. The room was lined with books. 
Not an "absurdist" library, I thought; too 
scholarly. The desk-top was full of 
rhinoceroses of all sizes and textures. 

"You must love rhinoceroses," I 
ventured. 

"Not very much, no. It's just that since 
I wrote the play everyone thought that 
I loved them, and all my friends started 
sending them to me. The same thing 
happened with The Chairs. Now when 
I'm in a room full of people and somebody 
uses the word 'chair' or 'rhinoceros,' 
everyone looks at me as if I had invented 
the chair and the rhinoceros. Won't you 
have a whiskey?" 

We retired into the living room, 
where the maid had set up a tray. I had 
to help him pour out his fruit juice and 
mineral water (good for the liver), 
because his right hand was in a cast. He 
explained that it had happened during his 
summer vacation in the Midi, when he 
had tried to ski down a staircase. 

There was a wild, contorted statue in 
the manner of Cesar that seemed to be a 
man in a funny hat on a sway-backed 
horse. The man's face was featureless, his 
body was twisted and lumpy. 

"C'est moi," he said. "The sculptor 
wanted to create the ultimate parody of 
the equestrian statue." I told him that 
the resemblances were striking-the eyes, 
the mouth, the arms, the bearing. We 
laughed. 

Ionesco laughs with his eyes and with 
his entire mouth, from diaphragm to lips. 
And the eyebrows-at once strikingly 
prominent yet seemingly lost in that great 
craggy plain of baldness-punctuating 
the laugh. Only the incredibly wide, flat 
nose anchors the other features down by 
staying still. All in all, a gorgeous laugh. 

I showed him the photographs of the 
Yale Dramat's spring, 1967 production of 
his Hunger and Thirst, so far the only 
production of this play in English. He 
had told me over the phone that he was 
anxious to hear about our production; 
since the time he had arranged for us to 
get the rights, the only thing he had heard 
was a sketchy report from his friend, the 
Polish critic Jan Kott, who taught at 
Yale last year. He quizzed me about all 
sorts of details . . . was there enough 
lighting for the brilliant fresh-air plateau 
in front of the museum in the second 
episode? . . . where did we get our 
actresses? ... and what were the monks 
doing in these photos of the "Good Inn" 
of the third episode? 

I explained to him, somewhat 
timorously at first, how much we had cut 
the scene and changed the order of lines 
to give it more direction. Far from being 
offended, he seemed pleased and inter-
ested, most of all in the gestures he saw 
the monks doing. I explained to him that 
we had differed radically in this respect 
from the production of the Comedie-
Francaise. The monks were not mute 
mimists; they were given an active part 
in the interrogation-brainwashing-revival; 
prayers, imprecations, chants, black 
mass blasphemies. Nor were they rooted 
to the symmetrical Brechtian bleachers, 
as they had been in Paris; they swayed, 
they circled, they practically danced. 

Ionesco thought it was wonderful. He 
thinks it would have been better if the 
Comedie-Francaise had done it that way. 
He wishes he had written it that way. 
He goes to tell his wife. 

The playwright wanted to know about 
the director, Leland Stowe, about the 
actors, and about the general setup of the 
Dramat. In passing I mentioned the lack 
of rehearsal time and the physical 
punishment the cast and crew went 
through to get this particular play on the 
stage. I started onto another subject, but 
he stopped me. 

"I am very touched," he said. 

Later, he was admiring a marvelous 
photo of the ghost of mad Aunt Adelaide, 
who was played by Eleanor Evans, a fine 
lady of New Haven theater and a Dramat 
actress and friend for thirty years. He 
asked about her. I told him that she had 
died within a month after the final curtain. 
He stared hard at the picture for thirty 
seconds or so, then sat back, took off his 
glasses, and breathed. 

Still later in the day, while Ionesco was 
in another room, his wife, in a totally 
different context, mentioned a closeness 
that both of them feel to the actors who 
create his characters. It all fit in. That was 
why I was there. 

He worried about the reviews-much 
more so than I would have thought. I gave 
him the Register's and the Providence 
Journal's. I helped him a little with the 
English. He actually reads it pretty well, 
though he doesn't speak it at all; the 
English lessons that led to The Bald 
Soprano apparently bore little fruit other 
than the play itself. Several years ago 
he had spent some time at the apartment 
of the cartoonist Sol Steinman in New 
York. There were always lots of people 
around, but few of them spoke French or 
Rumanian, so after a couple of days he 
stopped trying to communicate and just 
drank a lot and smiled at everyone, and 
enjoyed himself immensely. Incidentally, 
Ionesco's first language was French, not 
Rumanian; theories about modern 
dramatists writing in their second 
language have no relevance to him. He 
feels that he is entirely within the line of 
French writers-especially in that he 
revolts against all of them.
