~ ,etting the right kind of publicity. Both 
ll to attract and hold instrumentalists of 
suflk:iently high caliber and to develop 
a steady audience require that the 
orchestra in some sense make the Yale 
et scene. No doubt with the continued 
'f li enthusiasm of its supporters, combined 
perhaps with a little official patronage 
15 from the ruling clique in Woodbridge Hall, 
n this will ultimately come to pass. In the 
meanwhile one can only suggest that the 
Y Yale Symphony concerts are as interesting 
sc as any at Yale and well worth the atten-
j lion of the Yale community.

1$ . Beach Boys 
I 
1. The Beach Boys have done it again. 
1t lbey've come out with another album 
fX which has only two good songs, both of 
I which were popular as singles: "Heroes 
and Villains," and-believe it or not, this 
is a new album-"Good Vibrations." 

Aside from these two, Smiley Smile 
If (Brother Records ST 9001) is a mishmash. 
Some titles, such as "She's Goin' Bald," 
are more fun to contemplate than the 
ti songs are to listen to. Most of the songs, 
notably "Fall Breaks and Back to Winter 
:.a (W. Woodpecker Symphony)" and 
ol! "Whistle In," are insufferably repetitious, 
and banal to boot. On the other hand, 
i)e "Vegetables" is an amiable nonsense song, 
and "Gettin' Hungry" is a fair parody. 

But the Beach Boys have lost their 
inventiveness; and where once their sound 
waa vibrant, now it is moribund. One's 
reaction to the album as a whole is like 
one's reaction to "Wind Chimes" on side 2: 
at first it seems funny; then it becomes 
~ull. later stupid and inept; and finally it 
IS forgotten.

**Shaw**
**Author: Paul Malamud**

Shaw 
The Davenport Dramat's production of 
Shaw's St. Joan (October 26 and 27) was 
another reminder that the main weakness 
of undergraduate theater at Yale consists 
in the quality of the casts. The actors, 
drawn from Davenport and from the local 
area, did not measure up to the demands 
the play put upon them. This was espe-
cially regrettable in the case of Lois 
Look, who played Joan. Shaw conceived 
of Joan as a gir~ who was simple but who 
nonetheless had a certain strength of 
character. Miss Look, a small brunette 
with braids, radiated tomboyish goodwill, 
but gave the audience no hint of the 
magnetic attraction that the real Joan 
must have had to exercise over those head-
strong French barons. The rest of the 
acting tended to be caricature rather 
than characterization; (some of this, 
admittedly, turned out to be very amusing, 
thanks largely to Nicholas Bellotto, who 
played the imbecile King.) 

Paul Corum, who directed the play, 
did his best to supplement the acting by 
peppering the stage with slapstick, 
caricature and vehemence. This was 
entertaining, and it might have been 
successful if the drama of the play con-
sisted in fervid expression of emotion rather 
than in the tension between opposed ways 
of thinking. One should always get the 
feeling that the characters in a Shaw play, 
no matter what they say, are gentlemen 
speaking to other gentlemen. The actors 
in the Davenport production shouted, 
pleaded, and wept when they should have 
talked. Thus, by adding more kinetic 
energy than some of the scenes could 
comfortably contain, Mr. Corum 
weakened the drama. 

But, in spite of a certain lack of style, 
the production was splendid entertain-
ment, and drew a packed house the second 
night it was presented. The pace rarely 
slackened (in itself a miracle for college 
dramats), and Mr. Corum showed a fine 
eye for compositions involving groups of 
people, paying, at the same time, 
scrupulous attention to detail. Some of 
the credit for the successes of the produc-
tion must go to Lane Halteman who 
designed the sets and lighting, making 
excellent use of a few wooden platforms, 
a few flats, and a few chairs. The various 
locations were suggested by the projection 
of semi-abstract designs against the back 
of the flats. The cast was in contemporary 
dress, adding to the impact of simple 
design. 

All in all, it was quite an ingenious 
evening. If acting had been there, it could 
have been outstanding.

**Moon**
**Author: Dewey R. Faulkner**

Dark of the Moon, a play by Howard 
Richardson and William Berney, to be 
presented by the Yale Dramat on 
Princeton and Harvard weekends, is 
generally looked upon as a mere dramatic 
curiosity dealing, as it does, with material 
derived from southern legend and 
superstition. Actually, it is the culmination 
of an American playwriting tradition, and 
is inextricably tied up with the southern 
literary movement that is represented by 
Faulkner, Tate, Wolfe and Capote. Dark 
of the Moon is a far lesser work than the 
works of these men; but its history has a 
peculiar interest. 

In 1918 the North Carolina legislature, 
recognizing the cultural void in the state, 
agreed to the founding of a drama depart-
ment at the University in Chapel Hill; 
this primarily involved the hiring of 
Professor Frederick H . Koch, who was to 
create the department, produce plays, 
and encourage playwriting. Koch had 
done graduate work at Harvard under 
George Pierce Baker, who later founded 
the Yale School of Drama, and wlls 
influenced both by Baker's taste in plays 
and his revolutionary classroom methods 
(as was Eugene O'Neill, another one of 
Baker's pupils). Baker bad a special liking 
for the plays of Yeats, Synge and Lady 
Gregory, which drew heavily on Irish folk 
material. When Koch came to UNC, he 
encouraged the writing of similar folk 
plays by his students, whose knowledge of 
legends, superstition, and local anecdote 
necessarily bad to provide the raw material 
for original plays. 

North Carolina was then an especially 
fertile area for such material. In the 17th 
century, many English peasants who 
came to settle in the New World passed 
through the (for them) heavily populated 
Eastern seaboard, and moved into the 
small mountain valleys of the Appala-
chians, in search of new land. Their 
communities quickly became isolated 
from the rest of the country, and 
developed a thickly ingrown body of 
legend and folklore. 

In the 1920's (and even today) these 
communities remained approximately 
what they were 300 years ago. In many 
parts of the mountains people still spoke 
with a strange accent that was, in effect, 
a 17th century version of Cockney. 
Belief in magic was still prevalent-if a 
farmer wished for better crops, he might 
draw a circle around himself, abjure the 
Trinity nine times, put one hand on his 
head, the other on his feet and say 
"Everything between my two hands is now 
the property of the devil." 

Not only did people believe in a 
supernatural other-world, but accepted the 
presence of supernatural beings in real 
life. "Conjurmen" and "conjurwomen" 
were especially feared and distrusted-
one's neighbor, or even one's grandfather 
might turn out to be one of them. 

Normally, these "people" only spelled or 
"conjured" folks who had injured or 
insulted them, making them ill, causing 
their crops to fail or their livestock to die. 
Occasionally, when really angry, they 
would kill or carry off folks. 

It was the conjur-people, however, 
who were especially dangerous. But 
killing them raised a problem-it could 
only be done by a silver bullet. One 
Carolina legend concerns an old Negro 
who was out hunting with his muzzle-
loader, and noticed a red-headed 
woodpecker on a hollow stump. He shot 
at the bird until all his ammunition was 
exhausted, but the bird kept pecking 
away. Finally, he realized that the bird 
was actually a conjurman, so he took a 
dime and dropped it down his barrel. He 
shot, and the bird fell dead. Similar tales 
were (and still are) to be found all through 
the area; several of them seem to lie 
behind Dark of the Moon. 

Other sources for plays were local 
anecdotes, which normally emerged as 
exercises in local color writing. These, for 
instance, form the basis of .. The Return 
of Buck Gavin, the Tragedy of a 
Mountain Outlaw" by Thomas Wolfe, a 
student of Koch in 1918, and of In 
Abraham's Bosom, which won the 
Pulitzer Prize for another of Koch's 
students, Paul Green~ in 1926. Green's 
Johnny Johnson, another drama rooted 
in Koch's folk-play tradition, was given 
music by Kurt Weill; it was produced here 
last sprin~ in Jonathan Edwards College. 

These plays all take on a certa.in signifi-
cance because of the contribution they 
made to the general literary resurgence 
of the South in the 1920's, 30's, and 40's. 
Thomas Wolfe's Of Time and the River 
draws directly from the Chapel Hill 
material. Wolfe's original intention, 
largely because of Koch's influence, was to 
become a dramatist; he even went so far 
as to study with Baker at Harvard, but 
found Cambridge less stimulating than 
Chapel Hill and turned to writing novels. 

The "Southern Renaissance," which 
included such figures as Cleanth Brooks 
and Robert Penn Warren, collapsed soon 
after the war; but the folk-movement that 
was allied to it left behind such monuments 
(not only in the South) as Wilder's Our 
Town, and Gershwin and Heyward's 
Porgy and Bess. Koch's own monuments 
are the four volumes of Carolina Folk-
Plays he published between 1922 and 
1931, and, of course, the Carolina Play-
makers, currently celebrating their 
fiftieth season. (There is also a chance that 
the Carolina folk-play may be given 
another start with the off-Broadway 
production of a new one, Ronnie 
Umberger's A. men to a Mantis later this 
season.) 

Following Baker, Koch had conducted 
the class "communally": members would 
bring in plot outlines and scenes for 
reading and criticism by the class. This 
became, and still is standard procedure 
in most universities today. When Howard 
Richardson, a student of Koch•s in the 
30's, left Chapel Hill for Iowa State, he 
not only took with him memories of 
Carolina legends, but also memories 
of many of his classmate's plays, and in-
corporated somewhat more of their work 
than has been considered prudent in 
Chapel Hill since. Curiously, in the 
foreword to the "New Edition" of 
Dark of the Moon, Koch and the Play-
makers are not once mentioned, although 
Richardson's avowed purpose is to tell of 
the play's origins. 

In any case, the play itself is partially 
based on the Ballad of Barbara Allen 
and partially on the Undine legend. In the 
former, a young woman causes her lover 
to die by refusing to requite his love, then, 
she dies herself. In the latter, a super-
natural being falls in love with a mortal 
and is changed to a mortal himself on the 
condition of the mortal's fidelity; the 
condition is broken, and the unfortunate 
mortal in question dies. 

Around these plots, Richardson has 
placed a series of anecdotal scenes of the 
mountain folk, and filled the whole with 
folk-songs, dances, and proverbs, all of 
which give the play much of its life. He 
has hit the speech idiom amazingly well, 
and the play is produced frequently in 
the South. Dark of the Moon is probably 
the Carolina folk-play, and, although not 
"great drama," it is pleasant, amusing, and 
very entertaining in production.
