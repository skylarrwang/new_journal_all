**Title: Chaperone**

Four years ago I was a date in my own 
right, stamped official and game, in the 
fraternity hall. Now my only date is 
lifelong with housework, but here my 
husband and I go and get hired on as 
chaperones for a bash at the same frat. 

A frat party, a fraternity party, oh boy, 
oh man, you know what that means-the 
bottle-smashing, trow-dropping men and 
their fabulous mythical girls. And we, 
the chaperones. 

"You'd better cut that out," I'm prepar-
ing to say. "Six inches apart, minimum. 
Decency, please, respect law and order 
and your local policeman." 

But, though the place is still the same, 
the times change, the old victrola rejects 
plain old rock-and-roll, and this looks 
to be The New Fraternity Party. 

"Who are these hippies?" I asked the 
young man, who seemed to be encased in 
cold slime, en gele, under his Brooks 
Brothers suit. 

He made a noise of disgust in his throat 
that sounded like cut fingernails clacking 
around in a vacuum cleaner bag. "I assure 
you, there are no hippies here." 

On second glance I realized that the 
hippies-or pseudo-hippies maybe-were 
only hired help to do the light show, and 
that the real natives were all pulling their 
oar-the little oars on their ties, the 
big oar of their group spirit and group 
image-in honor of their fraternity party. 

I felt somehow out of time-and 
nothing in the proto-frugging being done 
by girls in long knee-biting skirts would 
have told me that it was '67 and not '63, 
had I just snapped out of amnesia and 
found myself there. There was one orna-
mental girl, with yeasty bosoms exploding 
out of the top of her dress, who looked 
like the legend-in-her-own-time of the lot, 
but no one seemed to be writhing in her 
wake. If she'd been an F. Scott Fitzgerald 
heroine she would have been worth a 
. good 20 pages, but here she seemed to be 
practically buying her own drinks. 

A lot of other girls, less memorable, but 
just as popular/ unpopular as she, were 
hanging around like parsley at the edge 
of a steak, while their dates took charge of 
the situation, and chatted it up with the 
other men as if they were the ones they'd 
waited all week to see. One ringleader 
type, surrounded by friends, but dateless, 
came over to watch the men put blood-
blobby slides in the projector for the light 
show. He had a face that was remarkably 
expressionless, but for a tiny salacious 
smirk (a strip-poker face?) and said to me, 
out of the blue, "Do you know Kenneth?" 

"Urn," I said. 

"Kenneth is just one of the greatest 
people in this whole fraternity." 

Well bully for Kenneth, but who was 
he? The light show operator? (no, it had 
been made clear to me that those people 
were not One of Us), someone in his 
entourage? the head of something? Who-
ever he was, this kiss of praise falling from 
the lips of Coldface seemed to be the only 
information forthcoming. He turned away, 
and refused to put up with further 
questioning. 

People were dancing in greater and 
lesser degrees of behind-the-times-ness, 
but no one watched them-all eyes were 
fixed on the light show going blitheryblip 
on the walls and occasionally catching 
someone on the dance floor in an old 
movie broken-frames effect. Where was 
the drinking and wild throwing of shows 
that people used to brag about in the 
same breath as they complained of their 
hangover? Pushed out of the league by 
drugs? Maybe. Whatever, the old line 
handed out by college boys that three 
drinks could make you completely 
irresponsible of anything you did, out of 
your mind, man, practically hallucinating 
-and any girl beddable within minutes, 
had either been given the lie, or else was 
just not the thing in this society. 

Maybe like fairies (the Peter Pan kind) 
the phenomenon only exists if you believe 
in it-and there was one man there who 
clearly did believe it-a graduate 
celebrating the drunken blasts of yester-
year in a drunken blast of today. He 
went loping around giving the only rushes 
that were given out, to all or any of the 
girls, and calling his wife, a woman whose 
smile was pickled in long-suffering 
patience, "that battleax" within earshot. 

Having more or less failed with the girls, 
he began bending the deaf ears of the 
members of this, his old fraternity, and 
giving the frat handshake and saying the 
password ("• • • • •, • •• • •") indiscreetly 
to everyone. 

The one person who would listen to him 
was a tender looking hippie (he just works 
here) who looked like the frontispiece 
drawing in a book of romantic poetry. 

"Yes, I go to Yale," he said to the drunk, 
"but I'm dropping out next term, dig?" 

He didn't seem to dig too deep, so the 
hippie told him, as if it were so obvious 
that only a drunk could fail to compre-
hend. 

"You lose your mind here, see? It 
hurts your mind to study, my brain is 
getting so stuffed up with garbage every 
day, I'm almost dead." 

"Maybe you could write copy for 
dropout posters," I suggested. 

"Let me tell you one thing," the drunk 
informed him, "these are the best years 
you'll ever have." 

The hippie faded away, and the drunk 
and I looked at each other blankly. 

People were dancing, or not dancing, 
pusillanimously, and though of course 
everyone was well behaved, diffident, 
cool, and I was glad to be beyond the age 
where such occasions could affect my life 
either way-to have liberty from frater-
nities. But at the same time I felt almost 
cheated of adventure, and so did the 
drunk. 

"We had some pretty wild times here 
in my day," he said with regret. Plain old 
rock-and-roll, I thought. 


**Title: Asia**
**Author:  [No Author Listed]**

Hubert Humphrey told a Pennsylvania 
audience in mid-October about "aggressive 
Asian Communism with its headquarters 
in Peking, China." When Robert Oxnam, 
a graduate student in Chinese history, read 
that, he realized that he couldn't take any 
more Administration analyses of the Far 
East. 

Oxnam talked with others among the 
one hundred graduate students and under-
graduates at Yale who specialize in some 
aspect of East Asian studies or Southeast 
Asian studies to determine how to make their 
ideas and information available to the 
public. With an eye to the approaching 
Presidential election, they decided to form 
an East Asia Information Project. There 
are now almost thirty students involved in 
the Project, which will provide speakers 
for community groups, schools, etc. 

Although most of the members of the 
Project oppose the present U.S. China 
policy and the U.S. involvement in Viet-
nam, they agreed not to support any 
uniform statement of opposition. "The 
purpose of the group," explains Oxnam, 
"is to present a broadly liberal perspective 
on the current state of the U.S. involve-
ment in Vietnam and the present U.S. 
China policy." 

The members of the group represent the 
entire spectrum of Far East studies at Yale 
and include a former State Dept. officer 
and three former Peace Corps members. 
Oxnam himself is working on his Ph.D. in 
modern Chinese history under Mary 
Wright and Jonathan Spence. 


**Title: Airplane**

Woolsey Hall can be better used than for 
Kingman Brewster's chinless attack on the 
Rev. Coffin, as was proved last Saturday 
night with Indian Neck's Jefferson Air-
plane concert. Not Airplanes, but Air-
plane, singular, that's important. A band 
of renegades, desperadoes, half-breeds 
from San Francisco, five men and a tough, 
lush girl named Grace Slick, who sings 
with a whip in her voice, drift onto a stage 
filled with $6000 or twice that worth of 
amplifiers, arranged like a transplant from 
the Computer Center. They took a little 
while, fooling about, but then, soaring 
above the pain threshold with 115 decibels 
· of vocal sound and 4000 watts of guitar 
amplification, a fellow going wild with 
colored lights, they found themselves. 

A plastic, fantastic lover called the Air-
plane. 

"You may have noticed the light show," 
said one after a few minutes, "we bring it 
with us everywhere." 

It's their world, it's where the Airplane 
·comes from, blue and purple, pink and red 
lights flashing to the rhythms, rhythms 
bursting out, the music whirring, twang-
ing, as though echoed a thousand-fold 
from a thousand foot deep pit, and Grace 
Slick curling back, snapping her voice, 
ten feet tall. 


**Title: Orchestra**
**Page number(s): 2-3**

The Yale Symphony Orchestra gave its 
first concert of the season in Sprague 
Memorial Hall on Saturday night, 
October 28. The program consisted of a 
Sinfonia by K. P. E. Bach, Brahms' 
Tragic Overture and the Beethoven violin 
concerto. The concert was typical of what 
one has learned to expect from this young 
organization: an interesting and musically 
challenging program performed with 
spirit, enthusiasm-and a few rough 
edges. The orchestra's music director, 
Richmond Browne, who is assistant 
professor of music theory at Yale, con-
ducted the first two pieces with some real 
success, although in the Bach Sinfonia 
the harpsichord was all but inaudible. 

The Beethoven concerto was, however, 
the highlight of the evening, both tech-
nically and musically. John Mauceri, a
