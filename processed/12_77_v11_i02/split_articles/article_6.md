EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
the new journal, december 6, /977 
prevented release of the MIT tech-
nical memorandum advertised in 
Scient(/ic American. Finally, the 
threat of prosecution dissuaded 
several postdoctoral students from 
presenting results at the conference. 
Now what exactly can the National 
Security Agency do to restrict re-
search on code theory? As you might 
have guessed, an awful lot. The NSA 
can prosecute researchers under the 
Munitions Control Act. Tenured 
faculty researchers would most likely 
be defended by their universities, but 
such harassment would create tre-
mendous problems for junior faculty 
and graduate students in the field. 
Secondly, as is alleged in the Times 
article, the NSA could threaten the 
National Sc1ence Foundation to cut 
off funding for these projects. This 
writer has independent verification of 
such activity. Naturally, the NSA has 
not had a great deal to say about the 
matter. 

At the present time. the govern-
ment has not moved to classif} this 
research. It has moved to constrain 
and control its de\elopment. in a 
manner reminiscent of the restrictions 
of publication of physic:. research in 
the 1930's and 1940's. 

Perhaps the NSA and other in-
vol\<ed government agencies did not 
expect the subject to de\<clop as 
quickly as it has. But controls on 
cryptographic research are ridiculous 
at this point, because too much 
research is already public. The MIT 
research is a perfect example. Prac-
tically all of its results have already 
been made public and published in 
one form or another. The only real 
problem that hasn't been explained in 
recent populari7ations of the research 
is how to find the variable t having 
the needed number theoretic prop-
erties for a decoding algorithm. But 
given the other information known, 
the identity oft can be found by any 
half-baked algebraist. The very fast 
methods for finding out whether a 
number is prime, a key to the MIT 
implementation, have been published 
in several different technical journals. 
If any nation should wish to create a 
secure communication system that 
cannot be compromised by a crypt-
analyst, the details are already public. 
The reaction of government intelli-
gence agencies is too late to do 
anything but needlessly antagoni1e 
the scientific community. 

Although the government's efforts 
to confound work in this area are 
essentially after the fact, it can exert a 
pronounced influence on researchers 
in the field. Even the publication of 
this article, which contains nothing 
that has not already been made public 
begins to tread on some extremely 
sensitive areas. The power of the 
immense government intelligence 
agencies is obviously a force to be 
reckoned with. Once a large 
bureaucracy commits itself to a policy 
of this sort, it is difficult to arrest the 
motion of systematized suppression. 

On the other hand, one wonders 
what we're actually trying to hide. At 
a time when there is much criticism of 
the Executive's unrestricted power to 
classify anything, and lawsuits pend-
ing to release classified information 
(for instance, present litigation to 
obtain documents related to the 
Rosenberg case), why should we be 
trying to make things even more 
secret? Perhaps we should make all 
the federal data-banks public, let all 
the supposedly secret, private, and 
scandalous information on millions of 
Americans go public, and have a real 
housecleaning. But if we admit that 
there are certain ideas and com-
munications which are logically 
private, if the governments and 
intelligence agencies of the world have 
a right to keep secrets, then so do the 
rest of us. Paradoxically, the govern-
ment is trying to make a secret of a 
system which would make secrecy 
democratic.
