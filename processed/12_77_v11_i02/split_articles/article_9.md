Computers at Yale. There are a lot 
of them. They're concentrated in two 
places: the Computer Center and the 
Computer Science Department, but 
just about every department in the 
University has at least one or two little 
ones. The Computer Center computers 
are crunching all day long at little 
administrative tasks that it would take 
human secretaries ten to twenty times 
as long to do. So those computers are 
primarily being used as administrative 
secretaries. The computers at the 
Computer Science Department are 
used primarily for research. Even 
though Yale's Computer Science 
Department is relatively small, there 
are about five major factions within it, 
competing for time on the computer, 
or' 'the machine'' as they refer to it. 
And now-a brief rundown of each 
faction with a blurb on what I think 
their research is aimed at. 
Systems: This involves research into 
computers themselves, how to make 
them run more efficiently, how to do 
things like attaching about forty 
terminals to a single computer, seating 
a mixture of grads and undergrads at 
them, and having "the machine" 
respond to all of them at once, even 
though they're all doing different 
things. It's lila~ havina a secretary who 
can type forty different company 
reports from dictation simultaneously 
and answer two phones whenever they 
ring without missing a beat. 
Numerical Analysis: The "number 
crunchers, • 'as the rest of the 
department calls them, are trying to 
figure out new applications of fast 
computer programs to anaiysis of 
scientific data and data analysis. 
Complexity: They tried to explain it 
to me, but I don't understand. 
Artificial Intelligence: These guys 
are trying to get the computer to do 
things that a human can do. Like 
reading a newspaper and 
understanding it. Understanding it? 
How do you know if it's understood it 
or not? Well, first it will give you a 
~llmmary of what it read, in its own 
words, and then you can ask it 
questions about what it read, and it 
answers them! 
At Yale, all the AI research is 
directed by Roger Schank, one of the 
biggest names in the field. Schank 
feels that the best way to make a 
machine act intelligent is to make it do 
exactly what people do, as close as we 
can figure out. 
At an international conference on 
Artificial Intelligence at M.I.T. this 
summer, Schank was the chairman of 
the "Natural Lan~ua_ge Processing" 
session. In Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
jargon, a "Language" can be either 
"natural", like English or Latin, or 
"artificial", like Fortran, wl}ich is a 
language d~igned for computers. The 
AI lab isn't very interested in artificial 
languages (which are primarily the 
province of the Systems people.) They 
are, however, interested in English, 
and how people use it to communicate 
with each other and understand what 
they read . 
Take this sentence, for example: "I 
hit Roger Schank in the mouth. " 
When you read that, you not only 
understand the physical action that I 
performed by "hitting," you also 
know that I must have been next 
to him before I could hit him , and that 
he was probably amazed that I would 
do such a thing, (you are too: you 
probably don't believe that I really did 
it) , and you expect me to explain the 
action, or justify it, and you expect 
Roger to hit me back, or order me out 
of his office, or call for help or 
something. You know all that just

Re-Viewing Jean-Luc Godard, or 
Why is This Man Smiling? 
A query some years ago to the editor of 
the NYTimes Arts and Leisure section 
suggesting an article on the Godard 
series that had played at the Carnegie 
Hall that summer elicited a polite no, 
thanks anyway, there's no news peg. 
I suppose there really wasn't, 
although the chance to see the 
near-complete works of any director in 
order ougnt to ment some attention. 
And Godard, well for lots of us 
Godard wasn't just any director. I 
offered a tentative title on the order of 
''The most important director of the 
sixties as seen from the vantage point 
the seventies.'' I realized later that 
their editor was new, and maybe I 
should have explained who Godard 
was. 
Because Godard was more than just 
the most ''important'' director of the 
sixties, in say the same way that 
Norman dello Joio could be called the 
most important composer of the 
thirties. Cinematically Godard came 
very close to being the sixties. (Of 
course a number of the old guard did 
some of their finest work in the same 
period, and I wouldn't want to say that 
even the best Godard was necessarily 
better than Tom Curtain, ElDorado, 
or The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence. 
But those were retrospective winter's 
tales-, and the sixties were more notable 
for their newfangledness than their 
backward glances.) Even at the time 
many of us felt that the decade was 
defining itself cinematically through 
the dazzling and precocious assurance 
of Godard, and looking back it's 
possible to see even more clearly now 
has almost aU his films opened up 
possibilities, showed not just where he 
might go next, but where movies could 
follow. That's what made his films 
look so different when you saw them a 
couple of years later. Andrew Sarris 
probably said it best, 
''But Godard was a very special 
case ... The pattern was always the 
same. Each new film would be assailed 
by his detractors as his biggest mess 
yet, and even his friends would look a 
little uncomfortable. A year later the 
same ftlm would look like a modern 
masterpiece, and two years later like 
the last full-bodied flowering of 
classicism. '• 
And now that the great creative 
period seems to be over, we can look 
back again. The view has changed a 
bit. The narrative dislocations of 
Pierrot le Fou, for example, no longer 
seem to intimidating as they once did. 
What Richard Roud called Godard's 
"realism" seems less important now 
than the various stylizations, and these 
too seem less ''abstract'', to use the 
other pole ofRoud's "dialectic." I 
don't know whether Godard would 
agree, though he might. He once 
answered an interviewer's suggestion 
that Pierrot bad a lot of blood in it 
with "No, there's a lot of red." 
The point of several of his pictures 
looks different too.La/Une Femme 
Mariee seems less a generalized 
indictment of that cliche of European 
filmmaking (or at least American 
critical reaction to it) • 'the 
meaninglessness of modern life'' than 
a specifically pre-feminist work. Pierrot 
le Fou seems less and less about its 
admittedly gorgeous North by 
Northwest-like escape from the lights 
and rooftops of Paris to the cole 
d'azur, and more about its close-ups of 
Anna Karina. 
But for me the key to Godard seem~ 
to be lurking somewhere in the 
background of Sarris' remark. And 
that I take to be something very akin· 
to nostalgia. It's not a nostalgta tor the 
past, except perhaps for his own artistic 
salad days. Nor am I equating it with 
Godard's fabled "romanticism", 
although that's a bit closer. What I 
sense in Godard, and what moves me, 
is his incredible awareness of 
possibilities-of the movies his movies 
might have been, would like to be, 
could never be. 
Example : At the end of his early 
film Bande a Part, one of the two 
heroes is shot after a suspenseful chase. 
The approach to that moment is 
extremely close in tone to the ending 
ofTruffaut's Shoot the Piano Player, 
only ... Only Godard just can't do it. 
Instead, short-circuiting the emotions 
of the scene, he has Arthur run around 
comically, like a chicken with its head 
cut off-a grotesquely funny dance ot 
death. 
The camera never moves while 
Arthur runs to the exact left edge of 
the frame, then to the exact right 
edge-as if there were chalk marks on 
the ground and this were a Minnelli 
musical. Unable to believe in the 
conventions of his story, Godard 
evades, and switches genres. It's like 
the moment in Pierrot Le Fou when 
Karina says "Fin du roman Jules 
Verne; retournons au policier 
deuxieme rang.'' 
But Bande a Part was planned as just 
such a genre movie, a policier 
deuxi'eme rang. It was to be his first big 
hit after Breathless. It didn't turn out 
that way, of course. Godard couldn't 
make it that way. He couldn' t believe 
in the emotions proper to the death of 
one of his characters. Yet his ftlms are 
filled with a yearning for just such 
genres, just such moments of feeling. 
More than any other director I can 
think of, Godard has had a very 
self-conscious relationship to his 
sources, whether in an individual story 
or a genre. But this relationship had 
become increasingly ironic, 
increasingly one impossibility until, 
clutching at straws, he latched on to 
the Maoist rhetoric that fills his latest 
films-a true counsel of despair. 
You can watch this happening 
chronologically. That's what makes 
each film of Godard's a • 'transition 
film'', as lea Hauptman has pointed 
out.Renata Adler said rather 
laconically ofles Canbiniers that it 
advanced the art of cinema ''a step.'' 
And in fact critics at the time tended to 
emphasize the novelty of each film, to 
see, if they understood them at all, the 
doors each f1lm was opening, even the 
doors they were opening for cinema. 
What seem more important now are 
the doors each film was closing for 
Godard. 
That's what I meant by nostalgia-a 
search for genres, feelings, certainties 
to hold on to. (Two of his films open 
with the heroine saying • 'Je ne sais 
pas.'') What makes this earch so 
poignant is that these are usually the 
conventions and ~~d .. 1gs he was able to 
believe in only a few films back. Pierrot 
le Fou seems to wish it could believe in 
love as simply as does Une Femme est 
Une Fe111Dle, Weekend that it could 
hold onto even the partial affirmations 
ofPierrot. 
That's whv Pierrot. thoueh in the 
end, I think, less successful than his 
other outdoor 'scope and color epic, 
Contempt, tS ultimately so much 
more affecting. Contempt, with its 
extensive use of classical illusion, its 
heroic images of statll'es and Fritz 
Lang, marks a tributary direction in 
the new journal, december 6, / 977 
Godard's career. The value of Fierrot 
by contrast has much to do with its 
central place in that career. Martin 
Rubin once called it 
''One of those suicidal works 
(comparable to Welles' Lady from 
Shanghai, Sternberg's Anatahan, 
Ford's Seven Women) in which a 
director lays all his cards on the table 
and afterwards must either completely 
re-examine the nature of his an 
(Godard, Welles) , or else stop making 
films altogether (Sternberg, Ford)." 
But this is only especially true for 
Pieerot ; it holds, more or less, for aU 
his films. 
Godard's situation was thus like that 
of many of this characters. They too 
often try to live their lives according to 
past literary and cinematic models, 
and , like Godard, they usually fail. 
Anna Karina may be able to '• danser 
com me dans les musicales de 
Hollywood,'' though she does it 
without the hoped-for "choreographie 
de Bob Fosse." But Arthur's romance 
with Odille in Bande a Part can no 
more be like Romeo and J uliet their 
English teacher reads them than 
Godard can in fact make a real policier 
(or a real Hollywood musical)-any 
more, in fact, than they can complete 
their teacher's exercise of translating 
the modern French back into the 
original blank verse. (Of course Godard 
is aware that even Romeo and Juliet 
couldn't live their lives by the already 
outdated Peuarchan love sonnet 
conventions they chose to incarnate.) 
"Send her to• watch Johnny Guitar," 
says Belmondo of a lazy maid in Perrot 
le Fou; but we know it won't help. 
Richard Roud has described 
Godard's career in a series of almost 
happy dialectics. I think its more a 
matter of painful paradoxes. Godard is 
ironizing genres at the same time as he 
wants to believe in them, just as his 
heavy irony toward the Maoist student 
heroes of La Chinoise can't conceal his 
desire for the clarity of their 
dedication, the simplicity of their 
belief. 
Godard couldn't help seeing the 
contradictions: The terrible beauty of 
his flaming car crashes; the visual 
appeal of those cranes, bridges, 
posters, and detergents he though were 
destroying the Paris of 2 or 3 things; 
the purity and justice ofBardot's 
contempt in the ttlm of that name, but 
also the humane sadness of Piccoli's
