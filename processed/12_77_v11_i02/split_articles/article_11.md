·Dreyfus' wonderful p.erformance 
reaches its zenith during a sequence in 
which he runs out of his home in a 
paroxism of frustration after trying 
repeatedly and unsuccessfully to 
decipher this mystifying symbol. 
Flinging himself frenziedly into the 
darkness he pleads with the sky for 
help. 

These strivings to understand the 
Shape are representative of Speilberg' s 
leitmotif of translation and 
communication. The languages of 
Math, Music, and Color are as integral 
to the composition of the film as are 
the linguistics of English, Spanish, 
·French, and Indian, all spoken in Close 
Encounters. A charming moment 
occurs near the conclusion when a 
bemused scientist, busily engaged in 
blipping sounds and tones to the 
Flying. Object overhead, queries in 
English, "What are we saying to each 
other?" The creators of the film might 
have dealt more succinctly with this 
universal question. 

The production is sumptuous and 
the director is a past master at the 
depiction of crowds, landscapes, and 
inanimate objects. John Williams' 
exciting but excessive background 
music thunders into the foreground 
with inapprorpiate frequency. As the 
French metaphysicist Lacome, Francois 
Truffaut is, qualifiedly, cute. 

Douglas Trumbull's encyclopedia 
of spectacular special effects even 
includes a marvellousLY petite U.F.O. 
that must be the Bionic version of 
Glinda's bul;>ble, but Spielberg's 
redundant insistence on illustrating 
every nuance of meaning with a literal 
visual correlary cripples the film's last 
twenty minutes. Visitors from another 
planet were portrayed-unnecessarily 
anyway-as minimally distorted 
humans; I consider such 
earthnocentricity revolting. 

There is enough stellar material in 
Close Encounters of the Third Kind to 
provide a few hours of diversion. As a 
visionary, however, Steven Spielberg is 
so hopelessly earthbound that he 
reduces the heavenly image of 
transgalacic communion to that of a 
mere Close Encounter Group.

**Keith Jarrett**
**Author: Jon Prestley**

Keith Jarrett 
Keith Jarrett is a complex, 
controversial musical 
personality. Critics spend pages 
speculating on his preferences in 
audiences, back-up groups, record 
companies, and his attitude toward the 
contemporary music scene. He is an 
artist whose music can't bs: 
categorized. And to complete the 
murky image, he's extremely 
temperamental and seldom gives 
interviews. Most critics believe that 
Jarrett's career is on the upswing, and 
therefore he is more saleable and 
printworthy than ever. 

In Billboard magazine terminology, 
Jarrett has the ability to "cross 
markets" in record sales. His eclectic 
style appeals to jazz listeners, fans of 
so-called "fusion" music like Weather 
Report, all pianists, and even some 
classical buffs. It bums like his JOin 
Concert solo recording have received 
5-star ratings from Downbeat 
magazine and almost everyone else. 
His solo recordings on the ECM label 
have been his biggest commercial 
successes in this country. 

Jarrett is a classically-trained pianist 
with effortless technique and a musical 
conception influenced by many 
sources, from folk songs to Debussy. 
Even to the uninitiated listener, his 
recordings can be entrancing. Though 
influenced· by the mainstream jazz 
tradition,) arret is never just a jazz 
player, and at time.s he is not even an 
improviser. He has many of the 
pretensions of a' 'serious composer.'' 

With a set of conflicting · 
preconceptions, this writer went to 
Woolsey Hall on November lOth to see 
and hear Keith Jarrett's American tour 
debut. The tour is somewhat unusual 
in that Jarrett is playing with a group, 
moreover, an aii-Europeon g,roup 
called Belonging. NorwegiansJan 
Garbarek, Palle Daniellson, and Jon 
Cristensen accompany the pianist. This 
trio has earned a solid reputation in 
· Europe, and the combination of these 
musical forces raised some speculation 
before the New Haven concert. In 
Jarrett's three previous visits to this 
city, he played solo. 

The presence of Belonging made 
little difference in J arrete's overall 
performance, as the pianist's playing 
completely dominated the ensemble. 
Not only did he fill a large part of the 
concert with extended solo 
introductions and interludes, he 
controlled the form and direction of 
each piece. Total group interaction, 
essential in this kind of free format, 
was negligible. It sounded more like 
three musicians trying to respond to 
each other's monologues. 

In his American tour' debut at 
Woolsey, Jarrett also used two 
techniques which have become 
standard practices in his concerts of the 
last few years. The first consists of 
hammering one note on the piano for 
what seems like hours. When he finally 
ceased the audience burst into 
spontaneous applause, reminding me 
of the man who kept hitting his head 
against a brick wall because it felt so 
good when he stopped. The second 
technique involves using different 
parts of the Steinway for percussion: 
the strings, stool, lid, or anything else 
within reach. What does it all mean? It 
must mean something; it sounds 
terrible. 

Jarrett has said that while on stage, 
he lets his subconscious mind take over 
and tries to block out any conscious 
thoughts. This means that almost 
anything can happen in the long, 
loosely-structured improvisations, and 
this approach can produce inspired 
moments felt by every listener. Too 
often, it produces periods of uneven 
quality and sheer boredom. }\hough 
the Woolsey Hall audience was treated 
to a few minutes of intense playing, 
Jarrett spent twice as much time 
fooling around, apparently waiting for 
his subconscious to make the next 
move. His concert recordings are 
selected from hours of live tapes, so the 
quality is consistently good. The 
concert-goer doesn't have this luxury 
of selection, and dissappointing 
experiences like the New Haven 
concert are too often the result. 

Perhaps his subconscious had a bad 
night, perhaps his concerts need a little 
more conscious direction. Maybe 
Jarrett really doesn't like American 
audiences. 

&ithJarrett left many questions 
about the future of his tour 
unanswered. He will probably remain 
an enigma, and a particularly 
frustrating one, especially for his older 
fans. B1,1t enigma or not, knowing his 
talent and potential, his New Haven 
concert can only be called a 
disappointment.
