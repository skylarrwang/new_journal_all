From music I bore 
Some gold-stone fins 
But they sank away 
From the waffled shallows 
From nature I gleaned 
Some hope of rice 
But it edged deep away 
In sunk stone bowls 
So then I asked 
For bowls and fins; 
I asked me a hand 
That could startle them back 
into finning the shallows, 
gilding, rounding; 
I guessed me his hand, that could gather bowls open. 
When I had asked 
Whom I had guessed 
He sent my asking out; 
And over and over he sends it back; 
and over and over it answers me, 
over and over it answers as he gives it, 
in the speech of fins, and in the speech of bowls.
