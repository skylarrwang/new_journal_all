Audio-Visual History 
''Many believe television is a passing 
threat, of which people will soon tire, 
just as they tired of staying up half the 
night with headsets for the wonder of 
getting Peoria in the early days of 
radio. "-Frank Capra, 1949 

The twin threats of radio and 
television have not passed. 
The average male viewer will watch 
TV for over 3000 entire days -
roughly nine full years of his life. If 
you feel that you are deficient in this 
respect, a decade at the Museum of 
Broadcasting should bring you up to 
standard. 

On November 9, 1976, The 
Museum of Broadcasting was 
established at 1 East 53rd Street under 
a personal grant from WilliamS. Paley 
as "the ftrst American museum 
dedicated to the study and 
preservation of the more than ftfty-year 
history of radio and television 
broadcasting." So far, over 16,000 
people have visited the museum. 

Founder Paley, also the Chairman 
of CBS-TV, says that he recognized 
the need for a "concerted and 
organized preservation effort" in 
1966. The following year the William 
S. Patey-Foundation conducted 
studies on the feasibility of a major 
permanent facility. The National En-
dowment on the Arts supported this 
research endeavor with a matching 
grant. 

Since its triumphant inception the 
Museum has been enthusiastically 
supported by all of the networks, 
public broadcasting, the National 
Association of Broadcasters, and 
several distinguished indej>endent 
broadcasters. Ahern is now permitted 
to request up to 300 hours each of 
TV and radio and broadcasting from 
each of the three networks every 
month. She anticipates owning 
approximately seven thousand TV 
shows and 150,000 radio broadcasts 
by the end of 1980. 

Most of the present selections have 
not been shown publicly since their 
original airing, and a great inany are 
from the first five years of large-scale 
TV broadcasting, 1948 to 1953. The 
Museum features Joe McCarthy's self-
defense on "See It Now," Fred Allen's 
"Town Hall Tonight," and uncut 
telecasts of the Kennedy-Nixon 
debates. Also available for your 
listening pleasure are some of the 
earliest broadcasts in existence: Bing 
Crosby's Rhythm Boys singing with 
Paul Whiteman's orchestra, Lucky 
Lindy's jubilant return to America 
and Mom, and a quantity of speeches 
made by FDR, the earliest of which is 
dated 1920 (he was but a young 
sprout of thirty-eight years). There 
are also a number of fascinating and 
horrible wartime radiocasts made by 
pro-Axis Americans and Englishmen. 
Hear 'em and weep. 

At the museum, in the Broadcast 
Study Center, I espied a technician 
industriously watching TV at her desk 
in the attractive, Jetsonesque room 
where audio and video tapes are 
presented. The architect responsible 
for the pleasantly futuristic design is 
Mr. John Beyer, head of a firm 
bearing the suggestively homophonic 
name of Beyer, Blinder and Bell. Said 
museum technician seemed to be on a 
first-name basis with some of the 
visitors; later she told me that several 
members of the museum arrive every 
day at lunchtime to watch a favorite 
show. "We've got a couple of fanatics 
who are systematically going through 
all of the episodes of 'Playhouse 90' 
and 'Studio One'," she confided. She 
also profferred a list of the Most 
Requested Tapes: The Beatles on "Ed 
Sullivan," "The Best of Ernie 
Kovacs," "Amos 'n Andy," and "Peter 
Pan." My visual appetite whetted by 
this tempting menu, I entered the 
Index Room. 

The Index Room contained peri-
odicals, a large central table, a wall 
covered with file cabinets, and a 
television. Onscreen Alistair Cooke 
was graciously welcoming us all to 
the museum. An introductory teletape 
effectively communicated the diversity 
of the material in storage, from 
speeches of all the presidents of the 
United States since radio waves have 
filled the air, to the comedy routines 
of Bert Lahr and Bea Lillie. It 
described radio and TV productions 
of classical drama, Judy Garland's 
radio debut at the tender age of 
twelve (as Ross MacDonald said, "I 
don't believe that people know every-
thing at birth and forget it as they 
grow older" -
the early Judy is less 
than spectacular) and a television 
appearance by Arturo Toscanini who, 
at 84, apparently hadn't forgotten a 
damned thing. There aren't many 
cartoons among the varied holdings, 
except for made-for-TV animation 
movies, but the Museum of Broad-
casting does maintain a library of rare 
books and television scripts, as well 
as books and periodicals on the 
industry. 


Visitors to the museum have ready 
access to this taped wonderland. In 
the Index room, one selects programs 
from an extensive, computer-
generated file of index cards, and 
reserves time at one of the custom 
designed broadcast consoles. In spite 
of myself, I looked up Yale in the file 
and found, in addition to two 
unexplained tapes of old Hasty 
Pudding shows from the 1930's, the 
1957 Omnibus production of Owen 
Johnson's Stover at Yale. 

Secure in one of eight consoles, 
each of which accommodates three 
people, I settled in for a broadcasting 
blitz. The museum technician on duty 
locked the tapes into place, and I 
attached one of the three sets of 
headphones to my eager ears. Always 
the new journal, december 6, 1977 
a sucker for Viennese schmaltz, I 
listened to Romberg's operetta, The 
New Moon. The romantic reverie I 
fell into while listening to a quavery 
soprano warble "Lover, Come Back 
to Me" was harshly interrupted by a 
commercial for Zlotnick's Furrier, 
circa 1937, and that cattiest of feline 
films, The Women. 

I heard the ineffable and probably 
inebriated John Barrymore give a 
superb reading of Hamlet's soliloquies 
in a rather absurd 193 7 radio show 
entitled "Streamlined Shakespeare." 
Ah, if only he had had a better 
editor! Stover at Yale, purporting to 
detail "the pretensions of college life," 
was introduced by the ubiquitous 
Alistair Cooke, who termed it "odd 
and funny ... a period piece." The 
show's set was painted and so phony 
as to be extremely suggestive of the 
actual campus, although a "set" of 
Yale is almost redundant. According 
to one of Johnson • s )alies, )ale "is 
the kind of college where a man stands 
on his own two feet, square against the 
wind." 

Freshmen of yesteryear were also 
advised to' 'Study the ftrst year and get 
it out of the way." With delighted 
hocror, we see the happy-go-lucky 
sadism of the class cut-ups and learn 
that " It's just as easy to know the right 
crowd as the wrong" - but so much 
less fun! Other memorable Stover 
·quotes included, "Be nice to 
everyone-but not too nice until you 
ftnd out where they stand." 

I talked with the affable Lawrence 
Bergreen, assistant to the president of 
the Museum, and toured .the ultra-
modern sound-filtering room, with its 
classic space-ship control board of 
sound filtering devices. It is used in 
the delicate p~ocess of preparing the

museum stores, one for use and the 
other for preservation and duplication; 
the medium lends itself to cloning. 
Radio programs frequently come from 
the 18-inch disks on which they were 
first played, while TV tapes are made 
from kenescopic films or from earlier 
tapes. The storage room , which, 
according to the press kit, "preserves 
the treasures of more than a half 
century of broadcasting,'' is a 
climate-controlled, fire-proff vault: 
the museum is a veritable Beinecke of 
Broadcasting. All holdings are cross 
indexed by computers, storage and 
retrieval systems are sophisticated and 
oh-so-up-to-date. One hour of 
broadcasting time on a video or audio 
cassette takes up less space than a 
single book. 

Recently the Museum became 
the largest radio archive in the world 
when NBC donated 140,000 hours of 
radio broadcasting to the 1500 hours 
of radio and TV previously acquired 
by curator Mary Ahern. The building 
also houses a collection of broad-
casting memorabilia: scripts dating 
back to the 'twenties, periodicals, and 
books dealing with the two media are 
among the treasures stored there. 

Television has been blamed for 
everything from the breakdown of the 
nuclear family to a proportion of 
illiteracy among young Americans that 
can only be described as Bionic. 
Comedian Fred Allen once said that 
"Thanks to television, the next gener-
ation will be born with four eyes and 
no tongue ... television is a triumph of 
equipment over people.'' It is an 
intimate medium, close-up and closed 
in , yet its influence is vast. Nicholas 
Johnson, former Federal 
Communications Commissioner, 
reports that ''95 per cent of all 
dlerican homes have one television 
set, 25 per cent have more than one.'' 
Television's influence, coupled with 
the selectivity of the medium make it 
doubly powerful: TV makes the news 
through its editorial choices, allowing 
the views of a few hundred people to 
affect millions. 

The Museum of Broadcasting also 
exerts an important selectivity: its 
choice of broadcasting specimens is 
destined to become history, since any 
speech Ahern. acquires is emphasized, 
probably inordinately, as history. 
Ahern, a graduate of Radcliffe, served 
in the Chemical Warfare Service of 
the U.S. Department of Defense. 
Museum president Paley worked as 
Deputy Chief of the Psychological 
Warfare Division of Supreme Head-
quarters of the Allied Expeditionary 
Forces in World War II. 

Many of the most interest-
ing things-orr TV today are the 
advertisements created specially for it, 
and the perenially popular TV play, 
Twelve Angry Men, succeeds because 
the sequestered jury fits well in the 
claustrophobic setting of a twenty-
inch screen. According to critic 
Gilbert Seldes, .. We are human and, 
given a chance, we might still create 
an art form of television." It is just 
beginning to achieve recognition; even 
Beinecke is preserving scripts written 
by Emmy award winning TV writer 
John Vlahos. 

Can a medium controlled by bust-
nessmen realize a future as an art 
form? The work of truly innovative 
video artists is beyond the range of 
television's popular culture and has 
not been included in this archive of 
..broadcasting" history. But the 
museum has saved some of the 
unqualifiedly great chapters of the 
Old Testament of this extraordinary 
religion. Frank Capra wrote that 
..This monster is a new god! An 
enchanting god -
giving rise to a 
new, raging mystique built upon the 
twitching stimuli of zap, leap, flip, 
and break. All other gods are past, 
dead." 

The Museum of Broadcasting is 
openfrom noon to .five p.m. Tuesday 
through saturday. a 11 contribution is 
requested of those who are not ready to 
make a lzfetime commitment to the 
new god.
