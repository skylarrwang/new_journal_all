(continued from p.15) 
As my concorde jet slowly cruised 
over the houses of Levittown into the 
black smog of New York, I sat musing 
whistfully and wishfully about my visit 
with Hermien. I had promised 
Hermien, when I left that unspoilt 
Eden of lush tulips, that I would 
always come back to see her on St. 
Nicolaas, our Dutch national holiday. 
(December 5). So I packed my 
duffelbag and bookbag and winged 
back to liberty, bringing her the paean 
I wrote in the last issue of this gazette. 
She was kind enough to notice, as soon 
as I walked onto her pasture, the little 
wrought-iron likeliness of her luscious 
self that now dangles daily before the 
deaf-and-dumb eyes of my fellow 
undergraduates, enticing those pooÂ·r 
creatures so far removed from her 
grace. After a fat and comforting hug, 
which filled my nostrils once again 
with her earthy scent, she set about 
chiding me for my clothes. "Where are 
your wooden shoes?" she mooed, 
tapping her hoof on my new, but 
carefully worn, Topsiders. ''Those will 
never do. And those pants. Really. 
They're baggy and drab. And don't 
think I don't see that nasty alligator 
leering at me beneath that shirt. 
Buttoned down, too." And with two 
quick nibbles she tore the buttons off, 
and to show her full disgust at my 
appearance, she lifted her tail, 
breaking several strings of my squash 
racket without even aiming. Blushing, 
I stammered something about doing as 
Romans, then offered her her 
chocolate letter. "At least you dido' t 
forget that, but you didn't bring me 
any frozen yogurt,"she said, quickly 
devouring the chocolate 'H'. (For the 
uninitiated and untapped: in 
Holland, we give each other chocolate 
letters at St. Nicolaas, just to remind 
each other of who we are, for the letter 
is the first letter of your first name). 
"And here's yours," she said smiling, 
handing me my 'A'. "And here's your 
present.'' Decency does not permit me 
to say what it was, but my heart and 
parts of my body melted as I kissed her 
eyes, and tears gently fell on her 
steaming snout {it was pretty cold). 

Just then, St. Nicolaashimself 
appeared at the uough where we were 
standing, allowing his white horse to 
drink with that dreadful equine way 
that those things do. The Stately 
Spanish bishop, clad in red and white, 
his tall hat swaying gently, his miter 
tapping impatiently on the ground, 
nodded once at me, then turned to one 
of his black servants, motioning with 
his gloved finger to hand him the 
Great Book. Not finding me in it (I am 
now a resident of Connecticut}, he had 
Black Pete give me a few lashes with his 
bunch of twigs, as is the custom w!th 
all naughty boys. Just for good 
measure, he threw some candy around 

in the field, then strode off, muttering 
obscenely about his rival, Santa Claus. 
As the pitiful.cries of the children 
stuffed in Black Pete's jute bag (a 
reminder that severe wickedness will 
get you sent to Spain to work in the toy 
factories) died off over the dyke, 
Hermien mooed contentedly, for we 
were alone together again. She sat 
down, and I beside her, and she asked 
of the wretched bastion of Eli where I 
dwelt. I told her ofHoho,.who she 
seemed to remember as some distant 
cousin of hers, of THE GAME (''all 
that grass, wasted on brutes" was her 
only comment), of the strike and my 
consequent lack of milk and hygiene 
(''no wonder you look so preppish'' 
she grunted under her nostrils) , of the 
cold and the commercialism , acid 
academic pressure and social 
wastelands of aetherized patients. 

Slowly, I sank into her comforting 
udders, and in the end we could do no 
more that stare off into the clear and 
antineurotic geometry of the pastures, 
the simple land of innocence I had so 
foolishly left for Kant, cant, castration 
and callousness. Slowly, the chocolate 
letter melted in my mind, and I with 
it, into the green and fruitful earth.
