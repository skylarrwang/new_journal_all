And All 
That Jazz 
A long, narrow room, rows of 
kitchen-type chairs, a 
conspicuous-and-proud-of-it soda 
machine,and a make-shift stage area 
bring jazz home to the public in an 
informal setting at New York City's 
Jazz Museum. It is a mecca for all true 
jazz lovers, founded by a small group 
that calls itself the Hot Jazz Collective, 
the kind of place that makes you want 
to tap your feet and type your paper at 
the same time. Live music and jazz 
memorabilia are presented in an 
easy-going atmosphere. During one 
Friday afternoon jam session, 
musicians walked in from the street 
and either walked directly onto 
stage, joining musicians already there, 
or sat among the small, intent 
audience for a few minutes before they 
were invited to join the concert in 
progress. 

Before you settle down to the music, 
you can look over the exhibits in the 
museum which include photographs, 
news clippings, old programs, letters 
and other assorted memorabilia. Some 
focus on a particular performer (Sam 
Wooding and Rae Harrison were 
recently featured) , some on a particular 
instrument and the musicians who 
brought life to it, and some celebrate a 
genre or era of jazz. A table covered 
with back issues of Downbeat and bins 
of jazz records, including some Woody 
Herman 78's, are available for your 
perusal and purchase. 

The museum's extensive archives are 
its most distinguishing asset. Ann 
Ruckert, one of the museum's 
directors, has an indefatigable 
enrhusi::.sm fur the museum Â·s 
collection of books, photographs, and 
recordings. "We have an opponunity 
to document an art form from its 
inception ... can you imagine what it 
would be like if we had oral tape 
histories of Michelangelo?" The jazz 
museum in New 'Orleans offers only 
memorabilia, and the archives at 
Tulane University covers only the 
relatively small genre of 'traditional 
jazz.' The New YorkJazz Museum is 
aware that jazz is still a fledging art 
form and has the flexibility to 
document all genres. 

The museum archives aoe not open 
to the public at this time. Only 
members with adequate credentials 
may sift through the files of documents 
and artifacts, though the museum staff 
is willing to assist anyone involved in a 
serious study of jazz. An invitation to 
participate in the museum is extended 
to working jazz musicians, and Ruckert 
encourages them to provide the 
museum with resumes, photographs 
and discographies for the collection. 

The museum suffers from the 
widespread problem of insufficient 
funding. ''Jazz is the bastard child in 
America," she observed. Over the past 
several years, the museum has had to 
move several times because it couldn't 
keep up with overhead expenses. 
Potential contributors from large 
corporations support the Opera and 
the Philharmonic more readily than a 
lessor known medium. "That's part of 
their way of life and they understand 
the necessity for it." Other museums 
in the city have not offered to 
incorporate the jazz archives into their 
permanent collections. 

There is no admission fee to the Jazz 
Museum, only an unspecified and 
entirely voluntary contribution . 
Membership is available for students at 
$8. -lifetime membership is $1000 
per year. Jazz greats, such as Miles 
Davis, a life-member, contribute 
financially and m usicallv. 

The Jazz Museum's current financtal 
crisis has resulted in the temporary 
cancellation of one of the museum's 
best offerings: free Sunday afternoon 
concens by great jazz musicians. In 
years past, Dizzy Gillispie, Teddy 
Wilson, and many others have donated 
their time and music, playing to 
packed houses of friends of jazz. It is 
not uncommon for jazz greats to stop 
in at the museum on their way to or 
from gigs in other parts of the country 
(or the world) and play an impromptu, 
unadvertised concert. 

The museum holds regular weekly 
jam sessions on Friday afternoons and 
evenings, with groups from every part 
of the jazz spectrum. On Saturdays 
there are afternoon concerts, followed 
by a "Get to Know the Artist" 
program. The exhibits keep changing, 
the archives keep expanding, and the 
music puts you in touch with the 
exxence of jazz. 

The jazz Museum is located at 230 
West 54th St. A limited number of 
membership forms are available on 
campus. Ca/120573.
