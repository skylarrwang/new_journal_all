Talus was the best guard anywhere; 
his record-breaking total of more that a 
1 hundred crushed, burned, and sunken 
ships will probably never be matched. 
Now he wasn't the sort of man to go 
around town saying things like, "Talus 
here. I'm big. I'm mean." Not at all. 
Of course, he never really went around 
town at all, seeing as how he lived on 
the island and never had any dealings 
with ordinary folks, except when he 
killed them. 

He was pretty quiet, most of the 
time, as big as six ~egular men, and 
strong as a whole navy. But he dido' t 
kill for pleasure, and not to satisfy an 
ugly temper. It was just his job, and he 
had been made for it. In his younger 
days he would use what free time he 
had relaxing in the shallows, watching 
clouds and stars, peaceful things, 
maybe to make up for the 
ship-smashing. 

He wasn't really so big as you might 
have heard, what with stories about 
him tossing around ships and eating 
people whole. Usually a stranger's ship 
would sail around to the east side of 
the island. There was a nice strip of 
sand and a little bay that was protected 
by a rocky cliff about a hundred feet 
tall. Well, Talus had him a cave half 
way up, and he could watch a good bit 
from his front door. When he spotted 
a speck on the sea, he'd dim b to the 
top of his bluff and wait, maybe catch 
a nap while he had time. But when 
that ship pulled into the calm water, 
Talus would take a running jump and 
come shooting down like a comet. 

When he got bored with his bronze 
ball dive, he would make some fancy 
flip or twist, then bore right on 
through the ship, fingertips first, 
straight as a plumb. Of course, if his 
jumping off place wasn't handy, he 
could always break a ship in half with 
one well-aimed boulder. 

There's something else about Talus 
nobody seems to know, and that's that 
he had him a wife. Son of a wife, more 
like a servant, really, named Lysia. She 
was bronze, too, but her color was 
lighter, more twinkly than Talus. Very 
petite, for a metal woman, maybe ten 
feet, twelve feet at the most, but · 
goodly portions, as they say. It seems 
that some witch over in Chelaan 
wanted to outdo Vulcan, and maybe 
she felt sorry for lonely old Talus, but 
whyever for, she built Lysia, a worthy 
mate for a creation like he was. 

Lysia would wait in their cave while 
Talus did his guarding, she would keep 
him company while he waited on his 
cliff, maybe she changed his oil, I 
don't know. She did save him from 
being alone, and she was not afraid of 
him. But they had a problem. 

The night he died, he spent a while 
over on the southwest beach. He 
wasn't practicing his dives, not sitting 
quiet or waiting for the moon to pop 
out from behind a cloud. That night 
he stormed around like the old Volcant 
Daddy himself, tearing loose pans of 
the shor~ and heaving them in all 
directions. He yelled, ''Curse 
Vulcan!" and "Blazes for Chaalia!" 
over and over (I think Chaalia must 
have been Lysia's witch mamma), and 
the whole place shook and echoed. 

Sometimes he might toss chunks of 
earth for exercise, but only for a 
change, as cranky Minos didn't 
·appreciate having his pile of dirt 
squandered away. 

This doesn't much sound like the 
calm type I was talking about, but he 
was due for a little tantrum after his 
set-to with Lysia. That was earlier in 
the night, and their voices got louder 
.and louder till I could hear plain as 
day. First thing I could make out was 
Talus, saying, "I am bronze, woman, 
not flesh,'' a nasty sound in him. 

But quick and loud as you please, 
she answered back, "And I am bronze 
and woman, man." Now on paper it's 
hard to tell you how mean she was 
acting, but the way she said "man" 
was enough to make me wither even 
further into my hiding place, and 
Talus, he seemed to take it for an 
insult, too. There was a deep crash, 
like maybe he punched a hole in their 
living room wall, and he just boomed, 
''You are an acorn. to this oak!" 

"And you a mule to this mare," she 
said, even and ornery. Now the way 
they talked was funny to me, like they 
were high-class strangers. But the way 
words rang out of their mouths. with a 
kind of instant echo, made everyone 
stick clear in my head. 

Lysia still was not afraid of him, 
though he seemed changed, into the 
bellowing bull of stories about him. 
Then she softened up some, sounded 
more like a real wife. "Talus, I am 
sorry. You are a great, a very great 
man, and I have loved you and served 
you all of my life. But I am not you, 
and not a great man." Nobody said 
anything for a little bit, then she went 
on. 

''Vulcan did not mean for you to 
have a mate, I know. But I need your 
touch, your glance, whatever love there 
is. A kiss, perhaps?" 

''Perhaps the kiss of man would 
serve you better." He stomped out of 
the cave, stopped just outside, and 
looked back for a second. "Or ass, 
perhaps,'' he said. Then he took off, 
going under me so close I could've 
touched his head, but right on by he 
went, like spurs were digging at him. 

For a while I just lay low, till I heard 
Lysia, alone in the cave, crying like a 
real woman. 

Let me back up a little, as you may 
be confused about my being on this 
island in the first place. I signed on 
with Jason just before his long trip, 
and he asked for too much to handle 
more than once; I'm not saying he 
didn't do his share, but he left a lot of 
dirty jobs to the crew. Everybody was 
scared of Talus, and Jason took that as 
a challenge.] ust couldn't abide sailing 
past Talus without poking a spear in 
that general direction. 

So he handed me a spear and sent 
me and one other fellow to kill Talus. 
Can't imagine what he was thinking. 
Drunk, maybe. 

We rowed the whole way for fear the 
moon might shine our sail at the giant, 
and we pulled our little boat up on a 
rocky beach somewhat north of the big 
bay, figuring that's where Talus would 
probably be watching. He was too 
caught up in his woman problems to 
notice us anyway. 

From where we landed, the only way 
to the rest of the place was over the top 
of the bluff. I had to find him before I 
could kill him , so my shipmate 
guarded the boat, and away I climbed. 

From the cop, I couldn't see my 
comrade or the boat ; that was good. 
On the way down the other side, I 
heard the voices ringing from inside, 
and I hid fast, near enough to hear the 
fight, but too close to the cave's 
opening for my liking. 

It surprised me that somebody like 
Talus would back off from a fight, and 
with a woman at that, but from their 
argument and the crying, I figured she 
might be inclined to help me out. I 
nudged my way into the cave, spear 
point ftrst, ready to hightail. Never saw 
a prettier woman, or more pitiful. 

• 'Excuse me,'' I said, and she looked 
up slowly. "Are you ... Mrs. Talus?" 

That didn't seem quite right, but 
surely only a wife could talk to a giant 
the way she did. She smiled at 
something, the spear still poking 
around in front of me, or maybe the 
question, and said, "Talus has no 
woman , nor will he have." 

" Does that mean you want to get off 
this rock?" 

She stopped her crying, and very 
ladylike, said, "Whatever I shall find 
apart from this island will be island as 
much as here I find. I can stay no 
more.'' Still that funny way of talking, 
still ringing right in my head, but I 
gathered she wanted to leave Talus. 

Very polite, I asked her if she wanted 
to make a deal, that she could sail with 
us if she'd tell me how to handle old 
Talus. 

At first she couldn't warm up to the 
idea. She told me not to even think 
about killing him, that he was really a 
fine man; she was the one I should 
blame. Well, who knows, but I 
believed her about Talus having some 
good in him. She totd me how 
different it had been before he started 
brooding, and about his fancy diving, 
how he liked the stars and uied not to 
step on the seashells because they were 
pretty. 

But after all, I had a job to do, and I 
kept after her about Talus' weak spot. 
Finally, she said, "To betray his 
secret's to betray nothing; you may 
know how he can die, but also know 
your weakness. He will never allow you 
to kill him." 

Talus could be killed, she admitted, 
by pulling some kind of plug out of 
him . Then all of his life-juice or 
whatever would run out, and he'd die. 

"So where's the plug?" 

She stood up, but seeing as she's 
kind of tall for me, she got on her 
knees so we'd be more face to face, and 
pointed down at my crotch. ''There.'' 

• 'You mean his ... '' I was still 
looking for a good word, but she went 

" Desire and life are held in him 
there, by a button, most small, and yet 
in essence larger than himself. From 
my most willing womanhood he's 
suffered much; a little man would not 
get even near enough to see it.'' I was 
still staring down where she had 
pointed; carne close to asking her how 
Talus managed some certain things 
(one in particular), but I figured he 
couldn't, at least not without killing 
himself. 

"Right. Yes. Well, look, there's a 
little boat hidden on that beach over 
the hill. Tell the fellow there that I 
sent you, and wait there. And try not 
to scare him too much.'' She left. 

All the way across the island you 
could hear Talus and feel the ground 
shaking. Maybe he wasn't quite as big 
as in the stories, but he sure made up 
for it in volume. 

I started toward the sound of his 
voice, but before a mile was up, the 
ruckus stopped. He was calming down 
some, maybe he'd go to sleep and I 
could sneak up on him. Of couse, he 
never slept, but I had to keep my 
spirits up. 

Then he was running; I felt each 
bounce and jolt as he headed for 
home, toward his cave; toward me for 
that matter. So I turned myself around 
and started running, too. Hid myself 
in his cave just as Talus started up the 
cliff. He called out Lysia's name while 
he climbed, didn't sound mad 
any more ; desperate, if anything. He 
didn't stop at the cave, just kept 
climbing and calling to Lysia until he 
reached the top. 

Didn't make any sense of it till I 
crept outside for a quick look. Just 
beyond the still water in the bay, our 
boat's small sail was shining away in 
the moonlight ; my friend Linneus had 
abandoned me. Standing toward the 
front of the boat, like a figurehead, 
was Lysia. Even at a good distance you 
couldn't miss her. 

And missing her seemed like the last 
thing on Talus's mind. He tore a huge 
hunk of stone from the cliff and raised 
it over his head. All quiet now, and I 
couldn't see his face, but the outline of 
his arms with the boulder towered over 
me, clear against the moon. He tossed 
that rock with such a snap it sailed our 
twice as far as the boat, then crushed a 
piece of driftwood and smashed into 
the sea. The driftwood was gone, and 
the only other target was our boat. 

Talus backed away from the cliff's 
edge, and I couldn't see him. I braced 
myself to see him running off, diving 
through Linneus, breaking the boat to 
kindling. 

After a minute or so he walked back 
into view. Saw all of him, watched him 
as he pissed into the ocean.Just what it 
looked like anyway, kind of 
matter-of-fact, head down. Looked 
unsteady for a bit, then, not graceful, 
he followed his water into the bay. 

I watched as he went under, then 
back to the clifftop, and I shouted and 
waved to Linneus and Lysia. They 
didn't come back, but at the top of 
Talus's bluff I found his note, carved 
in stone: 

Lysia, bronze and woman, wed 
To Talus, unwed, bronze, and dead. 

Took me a year to get off that island, 
and it's a year since, but nobody seems 
to know anything about Lysia. Maybe 
she couldn't live without him after all, 
and she's gone; all right. But these 
stories! I hear talk about Castor and 
Pollux and Jason and Medea, but none 
of them were around when Talus died. 
And Lysia was right-no little man like 
me could've gotten close enough.
