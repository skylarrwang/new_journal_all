Joe Brainard, a painter who once lived 
in a New York City storefront with Ted 
Berrigan, says that he thinks of Ted as a 
very large bear, although probably he's 
not more than average height. And he 
thinks of his beard as red. The beard is 
very full and very dark brown, with just 
the reddish glow that dark brown hair 
picks up in the sun. Ted Berrigan is about 
6 feet tall. He takes up a lot of space, with 
his long hair, his beard, his plaid flannel 
shirt and his 3-inch-wide baby-blue-plastic 
authentic-American-Indian-insignia belt 
between an imminent paunch and cor-
duroy slacks. 


"New Haven is very relaxing, after New 
York," he said. "A little like Iowa City. 
Fine pool hall." In Iowa City, if you want 
to relax, you shoot pool. Iowa City is also 
the home of the University of Iowa, fam-
ous for its creative writing program, in 
which Ted Berrigan is teaching this year. 
He brings the gospel of the New York 
School in poetry to the graduate students 
in writing classes, but between classes 
apparently he shoots pool and writes 
poems in which elephants parade down the 
main streets of Iowa City, bringing a new 
excitement to the plains. 


Having been invited to Yale as part of 
Branford's Hall Seminar, he explained one 
day in class that his long poem, "Tam-
bourine Life," was written, a page or two 
a day for months, about whatever hap-
pened or whatever struck his fancy at the 
moment. It started with a red, white and 
blue sign prominent in Tuli Kupferberg's 
bathroom and ended with the death of a 
Tulsa friend, Anne Kepler, who had gone 
to teach the flute to children in a Yonkers 
hospital the night that it was destroyed by 
a teenage arsonist. 


The next day he began by explaining 
that he had started a prose narrative, 
"Looking for Chris," after a friend had 
related a dream to him. He had included 
in its songs and phrases from the radio; he 
had tried to sound adolescent, even maw-
kish. Then, to avoid encouraging a false 
sense of continuity, he had taken scissors 
to his prose. Section by section, he cut his 
work into strips or phrases or single words. 
He arranged it; typed the results; cut 
again; rearranged again. He tried for a 
rhythm in the prose that would compen-
sate for the loss of sequence. He didn't 
really expect that anyone would be in-
terested enough to read much of it, but he 
had learned from doing it things he could 
use in other works.

**Title: A computer odyssey**
**Author: Paul Goldberger and Ray Erickson**

The Yale Computer Center is of growing im-
portance. More and more undergraduates 
each year are exploring the applications of 
the computer to a wide variety of fields, in-
cluding the social sciences and even the 
humanities. To keep pace with increasing 
student and faculty demand for computer 
time, the University is continually increasing 
the capacity and flexibility of its computer 
plant. The Computer Center now has one of 
the finest digital computing facilities of any 
university in the world, the core of which is 
an IBM 360-model 50 system. 


So reads an extract from Yale College/ 
Introductory Information 1968-69, the 
prospective student's first source of infor-
mation about Yale. The Admissions Of-
fice, which usually tells it like it is, has 
pulled a fast one this time, because not 
only is the Computer Center not contin-
ually increasing the capacity and flexibility 
of its computer plant, it is right now on 
the verge of getting rid of the IBM 360-
model 50, its pride and joy. It seems that 
"keeping pace with increasing demand" 
is proving a little too expensive, and 
serious consideration is being given to 
turning the 360 back to IBM, with no 
replacement system planned. 


If the system goes, it will leave a void 
far larger than the space it occupied on 
Whitney A venue. For one part of the 
Introductory Information statement was 
very true: more and more students are us-
ing the computer facilities, and for a 
wider and wider range of projects. Stu-
dent use now accounts for 25 percent of 
all computer time at Yale, and courses in 
the humanities and social sciences are 
competing heavily for use of the facilities 
with the science departments-who only 
a few years ago could almost call the com-
puter exclusive property. Computer de-
mand in education has been growing 
steadily and is reachrng unprecedented 
heights. 


Yale's public recognition of this fact 
has been enthusiastic-witness the op-
timistic Admissions Office statement-
yet the University's private response to the 
computer boom has been almost nil. Yale 
now underwrites a mere 17.5 percent of 
the cost of computation on campus, as 
opposed to Princeton's over 50 percent 
and Stanford's 40 percent. The rest of the 
money to run the Yale Computing Center 
has come from the US government, which 
has of late begun to tighten its own purse 
strings. Yale is reluctant to make up the 
resulting deficit; thus, the current crisis. 


The Computer Center was officially 
founded in 1957 when ten departments, 
representing the physical sciences, en-
gineering, forestry, economics and psy-
chology, banded themselves and their 
money together to support the cost of an 
IBM 650, a "first-generation" computer, 
almost primitive by today's standards. 
The administration's attitude then was 
much the same as it is now: delight at the 
existence of such a facility but reluctance 
to offer any financial support. 


Raymond Erickson, a graduate student in 
history of music, held the IBM Fellowship 
in the Humanities at Yale. Paul Gold-
berger, a freshman in Stiles College, is on 
the staff of The New Journal. His writing 
has appeared in the New York Times 
Magazine. 


Then things began to grow. In 1960 the 
National Science Foundation set the pre-
cedent for government support with a one 
million dollar grant, earmarked for the 
purchase of a new IBM 709 computer. 
Arthur K. Watson offered a building to 
house the 709; and Skidmore, Owings and 
Merrill, architects of the Beinecke Li-
brary, produced a slick glass house on 
Sachem Street that proved to all the world 
that the Computer Center had finally ar-
rived. These quarters have since been 
outgrown, and the Center is now around 
the corner at 15 5 Whitney A venue. 


Until1964, the few non-scientists who 
wanted to use the computers could do so 
only through the off-the-record generosity 
of the Computer Center. The University 
-until federal auditors put a sudden halt 
to the process-put NSF funds into an 
undesignated pool, then reapportioned 
them to include the few non-scientific 
projects, thus giving non-scientists com-
puter time paid for by science grants. The 
amount was slight, however, and only a 
few game souls from the Art and Archi-
tecture and Drama Schools and the clas-
sics department were able to use this tactic. 


The NSF grant of $700,000 spread over 
three years beginning in 1964 marked the 
first time a non-scientist could legally get 
his foot in the computer door. The grant 
specified that computer time was to be 
made available to all departments, with 
the University underwriting the non-
science projects and the NSF money pay-
ing for computer use within the sciences. 


Yale's share of the computer subsidy 
now amounts to $250,000 per year, but 
costs have risen so steeply that this year's 
donation is already gone and the balance 
of the current budget must be written in 
red ink. Yale's subsidy is not significantly 
larger than last year, although the NSF 
grant has now expired, and the Univer-
sity's failure to assume an increasing share 
of costs during the grant period makes 
renewal unlikely. 


An unanticipated 25 percent across-the-
board cut in Federal research grants has 
added to the crisis situation this year. Yale 
budget planners had expected some deficit 
in the Computer Center's operations this 
year, but the combination of less NSF 
money, less Federally supported research 
and the inevitable high cost of the new 
IBM 360 system have resulted in a cur-
rent estimated deficit of roughly $300,000 
-more than three times the anticipated 
amount. As plans now stand, student use 
of computer facilities will be bit hardest 
by budget cuts. 


Yet it is precisely in the area of educa-
tional use that computers are "booming." 
The 25 percent of Yale computer time 
that goes to class use is divided among an 
ever-increasing number of departments. 
Music, history, linguistics and the social 
sciences are all taking advantage of the 
facilities as never before. Indeed, the 
science departments are losing ground in 
their percentage of total computer use. 
The physics department, which once ac-
counted for almost 30 percent of all 
computer usage, is now down to 12 per-
cent, while the music department has used 
$15,000 of computer time so far this year 
alone and is one of the top ten users of the 
new 360 system.
