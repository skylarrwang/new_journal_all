When Tom Wolfe came out a few months 
ago with The Electric Kool-Aid Acid 
Test, the slightly fictionalized account of 
Ken Kesey and his band of Merry Prank-
sters, Johnny Krown and some fellow 
Law School students got so turned on to 
the idea of "having fun·· that they decided 
to try bringing some to Yale. But last 
December Krown, who had helped create 
the Warmth Committee at Columbia a 
couple of years ago. obtained a store front 
on Chapel Street and a Prankster-style 
name for the new non-organization: 
Cosmic Laboratoriu, Inc., "a happenings 
agency for the Yale community." The first 
venture for the Labs was The Silence 
Test, a moderately successful (whatever 
that means) event at which people played 
with cardboard boxes and silly putty for 
three hours without saying a word. 


For the past ten months, the Hog Farm, 
a large commune (fifty long-haired men, 
women and babies) organized about three 
years ago on a hog farm in the hills north 
of Los Angeles and headed by former 
Prankster Hugh Romney, has been travel-
ing across America in wildly painted 
buses spreading the same word which 
spawned the Cosmic Labs: free fun. On 
Christmas Day Krown met Romney at 
The Electric Circus in New York and in-
vited the Farm to try something at Yale. 
Romney said they would. And last Friday 
and Saturday nights they d'd. 


"Most of these people h d never even 
seen a light show," said Krown of the 
Friday night "mixer" at the Law School. 
"But everyone danced and took part in the 
circle games-including the secretaries 
and kitchen help. They loved it. At first 
they were afraid of the long-hairs invading 
the building with all their flags and elec-
tric equipment, but when they got to know 
them they really dug them. It was a fan-
tastic coup." 


The Hammond Metallurgical Labora-
tory, at the foot of Science Hill near the 
skating rink, has never looked quite so 
resplendently hip as it did Saturday night 
for the free Cosmic Mixer. American flags 
and white light-show sheets draped the 
gray warehouse walls, mylar lined the 
halls, and acres of long-haired and crew-
cut heads tossed and shook with the beat 
of the bands-the Hog Farm, New 
Haven's Jim Ground and some unknown 
group ("You have heard of them," said 
Krown with obvious understatement) 
which may or may not have been the 
Grateful Dead. "I can't believe it,'' said 
one girl as she watched the people holding 
hands and dancing. " In New Haven! Well, 
yes I can. They are just people, after all. 
Everyone needs this." On a balcony above 
the dancers, Romney, dressed in a jester's 
costume, told the people to freeze where 
they were. Five frogs were loose on the 
floor. A little girl, maybe three years old, 
rode through the panting people on the 
shoulders of a bearded man dressed in an 
Uncle Sam costume and collected the 
frogs as they were found. The dancing 
resumed. 


On Sunday, most of the Hog Farm 
departed for New York and for a farm in 
western Pennsylvania, the commune's 
east-coast headquarters. In New York 
they plan to exhibit the film they have 
been making on their cross-country jour-
ney and will, perhaps, be joined by the 
Grateful Dead and Ken Kesey. "Our plans 
for the future are kind of vague," said 
Mrs. Romney as she leaned against a 
book-shelf in one of the departing buses 
(named Road Hog). "I think we'll do a trip 
through New England next, but who 
knows?" A Yale student waved at the bus 
from the street. "Come back!" he shouted. 
"Yeah," said the driver of the bus. "Yeah, 
maybe we will." 


The future plans of Cosmic Labora-
tories, Inc., are vague as well. "There'll be 
some surprises," promised Krown. Since 
everything the Labs do is free, they de-
pend on loans and contributions-not 
money, which is frowned upon, but food, 
equipment, sleeping bags and volunteers 
-to continue. A sign in their store win-
dow tells you what they need. It tells you. 
in addition, that "today is the first day in 
the rest of your life."
