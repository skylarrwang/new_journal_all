Letters 
To the Editor: 
What is a scientist? We used to know what 
he was and what he did. He was a loner, 
a thinker, a man who changed the face of 
modern society. But society has changed 
in other ways in the last few years, and the 
scientist has in many ways been left be-
hind. "Big Science" is now the order of the 
day; the scope of the individual researcher 
has been reduced to the point where he 
can no longer keep in view the goal toward 
which he is working. His research prior-
ities are no longer his decision alone, and 
often he cannot find out from whence the 
decisions come. The day of the lone re-
searcher is of necessity gone forever, but 
we are not at all sure what has replaced it. 

An opportunity is long overdue for 
scientists to examine their role in Ameri-
can society. At Yale, as well as at several 
other universities, this opportunity will 
come on Tuesday, March 4. As a demon-
stration of their concern, scientists and 
scholars will meet in the Yale Law School 
Auditorium to talk about the nature of 
modern science, relations with the military 
and America's social goals, the economics 
of science, and other topics which have 
made them apprehensive in recent years. 
"The Scientist and Society: a day of reflec-
tion" will tentatively be built around two 
panel discussions, on "Science and the 
Military" and "Science and the Direction 
of American Society." Among the parti-
cipants will be Arthur W . Galston, Pro-
fessor of Biology at Yale and an expert on 
defoliation, especially its uses in war-
fare; Dr. Robert Lifton, Professor of 
Psychiatry at the Yale Medical School 
who has studied the effects of the atomic 
bomb on the population of Hiroshima; 
Seymour Melman, Professor of Industrial 
Engineering at Columbia University and 
an expert on disarmament; Steven Wein-
berg, P rofessor of Physics at MIT and a 
consultant on defense matters; Kenneth 
Keniston, Associate Professor of Psychol-
ogy at Yale, who is a well known writer 
on the student radical and the alienation 
of youth; John Morton Blum, Farnum 
Professor of H istory at Yale; Harry 
Magdoff, Professor of Economics at the 
New School for Social Research who is 
currently conducting a seminar on im-
perialism at T imothy Dwight College; 
and Gerald F einberg, Professor of Physics 
at Columbia University and recently au-
thor of "The Prometheus Project." The 
emphasis of the day's activities will be on 
free and open discussion rather than lec-
tures; it will clearly not be free from con-
troversy. 

No one knows what the outcome of the 
day will be. Perhaps it will be a nice polite 
discussion which everyone will soon for-
get. But maybe we will all learn a little 
about how things really are and get some 
ideas about how we would like things to 
be. Perhaps it will be the start of a con-
tinuing forum. We have heard too often 
of how science deals with utopias; it is high 
time to talk about the realities of science.
