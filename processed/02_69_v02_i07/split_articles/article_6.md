"You see, I like talking about the actor 
experiencing things, living and finding 
things out for himself. Instead of saying 
to the actor, 'remember what it's like,' I 
give him an exercise that is an experience 
he can use later up on the stage. The Cat 
itself is not theatrical, but it does give the 
actor an experience he can then turn into 
something theatrical." 

He spoke of Grotowski. "He's quite 
plump, and he has these very thick glasses, 
and his sense of the theatrical leads him to 
wear black suits-most people see him as a 
great god, a great guru. He's extremely 
warm and patient, he'll listen to you talk, 
and then he'll talk, sometimes for hours on 
just what you said. 

"He exercises his students strenuously 
-you know, to keep people from thinking 
too much, to keep it down in the body. 
But he concentrates on individual people 
-
he works with them on their ground, in-
stead of trying to change them to his own 
style. That's the trouble, though, with 
talking about Grotowski. Everyone kind 
of has a piece of the pie; Peter Brook will 
say it's this, and Tom O'Horgan will say 
it's this, and it really isn't any one thing. 
It's like the Bible: you can use it to say 
anything. Grotowski is the word. He has 
been known in Europe as the leading act-
ing teacher for a few years now, but 
America only really turned on to him 
since his book, Towards a Poor Theater, 
and a tour which was cut short by the 
Czech invasion. 

"The method I'm using in my classes 
is a combination of things taken not only 
from Grotowski but also from Brook, 
O'Horgan, Eugenio Barba, who I worked 
with in Europe, the Becks, Joe Chaikin 
of the Open Theater-all kinds of places. 
Basically, I believe in the theory of acting 
that says you become afraid because you 
run, rather than you run because you're 
afraid. So I always begin with the physical 
before the mental or emotional; the ideal 
is finally to unite all three, which is pretty 
rare. Incidentally, the work done at the 
Esalen Institute is very similar to some of 
my relaxation exercises, and one girl who 
was in my workshop said the exercises we 
did were just like the Reich ian analysis 
she was going through at the time. 

"A good example of something physical 
leading to something emotional is the 
scene we just finished blocking in The 
Bacchae, where the chorus starts to crush 
!he guards against the palace. The people 
10 the chorus approach the guards really 
believing in their bodies that they are go-
ing to crush the guards, and the guards 
actually become frightened as they crouch 
beneath them. Of course, they aren't 
crushed-the action is in the extreme, 
but not carried through to the conclusion. 
But the scene really bas dramatic impact. 

"Another thing I am trying to do in my 
workshop, and it's one of the hardest-! 
try to get rid of the actors' super-egos, and 
maybe even their egos. So many actors are 
on these incredible ego-trips; it comes 
from years of training and learning to 
criticize and evaluate each other. What 
I try to do is to get rid of the built-up ten-
sions and inhibitions in an actor which 
stop him from doing something, rather 
than tell him what be should do." 

Susie Rosenberg, who was pouring 
honey into the tea she had just brought 
from the kitchen, put down her cup and 
stood up. "So you see, with The Cat," she 
said through a Danish accent, "you can 
feel what you can't do. If you can't stand 
on your head, or what. And-" she 
stretched out on the carpet "-when you 
bend your back, you bend it until you can't 
make it go any further, so your lower 
spine, which is really the center of your 
physical energy, becomes really flexible. 
It helps relieve tensions." 

"The idea is to feel with the body and 
to feel the body itself," said Stanley. 
"When I crouch down as far as I can go, 
I can really feel the weight pressing down 
on me. But if I'm standing and someone 
says, 'Don't you feel the pressure of mod-
ern society,' I don't really know what he is 
talking about." 

"Tai Chi, which I've been using with the 
guards, helps you feel this too. It makes 
you feel how heavy your body really is 
and what an effort it is-" he stood up 
"-to stand up." He sat down and smiled. 
"So I don't stand up so much any 
more." 

Unfortunately, Rosenberg and Gregory 
have not had enough time-only six 
weeks-to work with the Bacchae chorus 
and principal actors; it is not unusual for a 
repertory company to work on a produc-
tion for a whole year. Still, in spite of the 
rather frantic rush involved, people in the 
company are excited by what many think 
will be a good production, another attempt 
to take an ancient Greek museum piece 
outside the museum and put it into the 
theater, where it belongs. ::;
