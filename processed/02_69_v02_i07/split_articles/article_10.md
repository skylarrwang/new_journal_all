The apprentice professors in grad school, like the 
more established folk who teach them, live by their 
unexamined values. More often than not, the grad-
uate student's assumptions indicate levels of timidity, 
smugness and pedantry that would amaze his in-
structors. After Bonnie McGregor had written her 
famous comment on women at Yale (NJ Nov. 3, '68), 
a half do:z:en grad students told me that since "you 
work for the New Journa I, you must know this 
McGregor person and what's wrong with her any-
way?" For these questioners, my reply that nothing 
was wrong with her only implied that something 
was wrong with me too. 

The basic principle of the grad-student faith is a 
pious respect for the academic pecking order. There 
are "good graduate schools" and "bad graduate 
schools," and students at a good place, like Yale, are 
better than people at those other places. There are 
also "good colleges" and "bad colleges," with lots of 
"undistinguished colleges" wallowing between. One 
attends a "good graduate school" to secure a teach-
ing appointment at a "good college." American aca-
demics stretches out like a medieval Great Chain of 
Being, and it's all quite simple except in years when 
a good job is hard to find. After visiting the American 
Historical Association convention, I reported to some 
of my peers that this year a job at the University of 
Maryland was considered a choice position. Although 
they knew little about Maryland's history department, 
my colleagues were incredulous at the thought of 
teaching in it: the main complaint seemed to be that 
the undergraduates at Maryland enjoyed themselves. 

In another instance, I have tried to explain that the 
American historian whom I most admire, William 
Appleman Williams, has left the University of Wis-
consin to teach at Oregon State. This removal, how-
ever, only convinced these scholars that Williams is 
as cra:z:y as Oscar Handlin says he is. 

Doug Lackey complains that faculty members ue 
obsessed with the notion that "Standards are to be 
Maintained in the Field," but graduate students ue no 
less concerned about the purity of their disciplines. 
There are few creatures more wrathful than the Ph.D. 
candidate who loses a place in seminar to an M.A.T.; 
after all, he is going to extend the boundaries of 
knowledge while she will only teach a bunch of kids. 

A bright and liberal grad student once explained to 
me that because I belonged to the American Studies 
Department, I wasn't a real historian, but somebody 
who "sits around and reads novels." No Â·one is more 
concerned about Maintaining Standards than the typi-
cal teaching fellow; not only is he cheap with 
"honors," but he incessantly mutters that the Yalies 
don't live the "life of the mind" like they did at 
Alma Mater. 

Contentious and lively B. A.s who enter grad 
school are acculturated very rapidly. Student influ-
ence is at least as important as the faculty's. The 
tweed jackets and the clickclickclick of attache cases 
does something to you. Graduate students soon for-
get that people who aren't professors sometimes do 
worthwhile things. When a good student leaves in 
disgust or despair, everyone asks, "But what will he 
do?" lt doesn't seem possible that an intelligent per-
son could fill teeth, practice law, write novels, com-
pose music, play the trumpet or search out forest fires. 

Leaving graduate school, one falls off the edge of 
the life of the mind, thence to be devoured by cops, 
cab drivers and Iowa State pom-pom girls. 

The saddest aspect of grad students is their lack 
of whimsy. Out of perversity I have sometimes 
treated my seminars to eccentric historical or literary 
interpretations. I wanted to provoke something. My 
colleagues merely frown at these weird ideas--then 
write them down, in case they represent some new 
historiographic school which might come up on orals. 

While discussing the " 'Nice' Revolution," Jeffrey 
Romoff tells us that the grad students formed a com-
mittee "to solicit and collate new ideas and ap-
proaches in political science." The goal is worthy, but 
the method sounds so somber. I wonder if Bentham 
and Mill ever thought to solicit Adam Smith and 
Ricardo? Did Marx solicit and Engels collate the 
Young Hegelians? 

Richard Hofstadter--no radical he--has suggested 
that the intellectual is both pious and playful in his 
response to ideas. The intellectual greatly values 
ideas for their innate worth, but he possesses "some-
thing to prevent [piety] from being exercised in an 
excessively rigid way;" he feels "sheer delight in 
intellectual activity." Unfortunately, with all that piety 
and very little play, graduate students may well be-
come dull boys and stilted intellects. :

Duke knows of no other case in history 
in which hypnosis was secretly used by 
the prosecution on its witness; Miller talks 
about brainwashing and hypnosis as if 
they were the same, but according to the 
psychiatrist, there is a "slight" difference 
in this case. Legally, Duke regards the 
whole affair as bizarre. "When and if the 
facts are ever acknowledged, this case 
could rank with Sacco and Vanzetti, or 
Sam Shephard, with two signal differ-
ences: (1) There is no apparent reason why 
the United States Government should 
want to gang up on Jimmy Miller; (2) the 
evidence of innocence here is positively 
overwhelming." 

Duke has written letters to the Solicitor 
General, who replied by form letter, and 
to Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who 
didn't reply at all. He has had Miller take 
polygraph and truth serum tests, both of 
which Miller passed. 

MilJer has more than one lawyer work-
ing on his case. A public affairs group in 
Milford named itself the Committee for 
Justice after Miller's conviction. It has 
helped pay his legal expenses as well as the 
cost of hiring private investigators to 
track Natalizio. For the first trial, Miller 
hired well-known trial lawyer Percy 
Forman, who had a hand in Jack Ruby's 
defense and who also successfully de-
fended Candy Mossier. Forman charged 
Miller only seven thousand five hundred 
dollars, although rumor had the price at 
fifty thousand. Duke estimates that Miller 
has spent between seventy and eighty 
thousand dollars in his own defense. 

Steven Duke was approached by the 
Committee to write a scholarly brief for 
the first appeal, but he says, "The more I 
learned about the case, the more I became 
convinced that it was a question of mis-
taken identity. I got involved and I started 
from scratch." Duke is no financial burden 
on Miller since he works without a fee. 
"Maybe I just don't like to give up on a 
fight, but I know the guy is innocent. And 
I have never had an innocent client who 
was not ultimately acquitted. 

"This case gives the lie to the argument 
that the criminally accused gets all the 
breaks. The courts reverse one decision in 
fifty, and if the 'Organized Crime' label 
is attached, they reverse one in a hundred. 
"In the courts today, the cards are still 
stacked very much against the defendent. 
Basically it is because the government has 
the resources and because the trial is a 
matter of surprise; the defense doesn't 
know what the prosecution is going to 
present, and often the jurors tend to as-
sume the defendant is guilty. And if the 
government wants to convict someone, it 
will, no matter how long it takes-
look 
at Jimmy Hoffa." 

Duke maintains that if the Miller case 
had been one of robbery or murder, the 
Natalizio confession and the questions 
raised in the procedure of Miller's trial 
would have been sufficient to gain a retrial. 
"The problem centers on the fact that 
the federal government doesn't usually 
make a mistake in a narcotics case, 
especially in the massive research neces-
sary to get at 'Organized Crime.' When 
they spend a quarter of a million dollars, 
the investment is too great to let the whole 
case go down the drain. 

"The second factor is the extraordinary 
publicity that pressured the government 
from the beginning. The newspapers were 
told that the top narcotics smuggler in the 
country had been apprehended and that 
Miller was the central figure in the biggest 
international dope conspiracy ever un-
covered. 

"Even though the evidence showed that 
whoever was guilty was only part of a 
small-time operation, the government had 
committed itself. And it is so difficult to 
convict the big racketeers in general that 
the government was emotionally and 
psychologically committed to making any 
conviction stick." 

The big publicity splash had committed 
everyone from Attorney General Robert 
Kennedy's office on down. Duke explains 
that the more mistakes that are uncovered 
in a conviction, the more the higher courts 
feel "that there must have been a reason 
for getting this guy." And the appeal 
courts generally try to keep their hands 
off narcotics conspiracy cases, anyway. 

"In a case labeled 'Organized Crime,' 
with all the publicity of Mafia influence in 
politics and government, the rumors of 
mob influence and bribery run wild. The 
people who believe Miller is innocent 
accuse the federal agents and judges of 
yielding to pressure; the people who are 
sympathetic to Miller are accused of being 
on the mob payroll. In fact, people say the 
Cosa Nostra is paying me to get Miller 
off, which is absurd." 

The significant pressure on Steven 
Duke is one of time and energy. The total 
involvement in the Miller case has been 
both a financial and professional burden. 
"Part of the problem," Duke explains, 
"is that my classroom preparation has 
suffered. 1 haven't had any time to absorb 
all the implications, the theoretical con-
siderations that we usually talk about in 
the classroom. 

"I try to keep the case as a case out of 
my courses; but the things that I have 
learned and tries to express in class are 
important. All of my direct experience as 
a criminal lawyer has been in defending 
indigents, the run-of-the-mill criminal 
case. This is the staple problem for schol-
ars and teachers, although it hasn't been 
adequately dealt with in the classroom by 
any means. But the Miller case has the 
whole new perspective of big Justice De-
partment politics, of 'Organized Crime' 
and of big courtroom publicity. And the 
lesson learned is that the rules of the game, 
the rules the Supreme Court lays down, 
have almost no impact on a decision." 

Duke relates his courtroom-academic 
conflict to the larger questions of purpose 
being raised in the Law School. Some stu-
dents and faculty maintain that the social 
obligations are more important than the 
the academic responsibilities. A more tra-
ditional viewpoint asserts that the Law 
School, as such, has no obligation to solve 
specific problems in a direct way. 

"The 'enlightened' view now is that the 
Law School should involve itself in cur-
rent problems only to the extent that that 
is the best way to convey to students the 
skills they need. But it is really difficult, 
from my own experience, to get involved 
and then pull out and gain an academic 
perspective. 

"The encouraging thing is that students 
go out and work on cases like this and 
then bring the information and insight into 
the classroom. If they form the bridge 
with the outside, then there is Jess reason 
for the professor to do it; and he can then 
synthesize, can present an academic 
overview. 

"This is the first time, as far as I know, 
that a law professor has taken up the de-
fense in a case involving organized crime. 
Usually, they just handle cases of indigents 
or cases involving some legal principle. 
But I guess a legal principle is involved 
here, too: the principle that you don't 
send an innocent man to prison.":

At a reading the next day, pushing for 
the last time against the questions about 
what he wants the reader to get from his 
work, he said that, for him, the poem lies 
as much on the surface of the page as does 
the paint in an abstract expressionist paint-
ing. The poet brings to his composition 
what depth of understanding and experi-
ence he commands, and the reader brings 
his own resources to the reading of it. But 
poet and reader do not meet in universal 
experience: the experiences they take 
away from the poem remain as different 
as their responsibilities to it. 

Ted Berrigan published The Sonnets 
with Grove Press in 1967. Many poems in 
the collection are made of phrases selected 
and rearranged from earlier sonnets, then 
rearranged again and again later in the 
sequence. Phrases, lines and words change 
their meanings as their places change. 
Each sonnet seems a separate manifesta-
tion of a very private world where no per-
son or thing can be sure of direct connec-
tion with any other person or thing. This 
month Corinth Books, in New York, is 
publishing a new collection of Berrigan's 
poetry, Many Happy Returns, with a 
cover by Joe Brainard. Along with "Per-
sonal Poems" and others, it contains the 
long poems "Bean Spasms," "Tambourine 
Life" and "Many Happy Returns"-three 
versions of what might be the same work, 
because all of it makes up the poet's work-
ing life. If The Sonnets were sustained by 
the unity of their language, the new collec-
tion reveals what critics usually call a 
voice. It is the sound of a man writing, 
making life into poetry. Many happy re-
turns, Ted.
