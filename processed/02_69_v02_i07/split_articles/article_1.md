Recruiting for the CIA just ain't like it 
used to be. Why, just a few years, a few 
suppressed revolutions and a Vietnam War 
ago, a clean-cut, hard-working recruiter 
could put a few ads in the college paper, 
sit back and take it easy. But this is an 
idyllic picture of a paradise lost, for in an 
age of increasingly complex problems the 
CIA recruiter has not been left behind. 
He wants to recruit students from college, 
and yet when he goes for a campus tour, 
he is besieged by protestors sitting in on 
him, demonstrating outside and generally 
giving him a hard time. What to do? Go 
underground, stupid, that's what you're 
all about anyway. If you can't recruit 
secretly at Yale, how the hell arc you going 
to walk down Main Street in Peking with-
out being noticed, right? 


So C IA recruitment at Yale today is not 
unlike a secret society tapping prospective 
members. The recruiter quietly goes 
around collecting names and unobtrusive-
ly calls select students and asks them if 
they want to be spies. 


But don't think that it's easier to get into 
the CIA than Skull and Bones, because 
after the tap you ain't there yet. First you 
have to take a test-sort of like spy boards. 
It seems unfair, though, that only the 
select few who are tapped ever get to try 
their luck at the spy boards. Pity the poor 
aspiring spy who never gets that mys-
terious phone call, because he can never 
find out when and where to take the test. 
Fear no longer. For all of you aspiring 
spies and the scads of you who just want to 
take a spy board, let us let you in on a little 
secret. The CIA is giving these examina-
tions at Yale this Saturday, February 22, 
at 8:45AM at the Sterling Chemistry 
Laboratory. 


It may be early in the morning, but ifs 
worth getting up for.
