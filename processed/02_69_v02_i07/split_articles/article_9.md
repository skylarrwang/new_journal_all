Confessions of a graduate student 
who is fed up with other graduate students 
by Leo Ribuffo 

Like the fluffy schmoo in AI Capp's c.,toons, the 
graduate student is among the most docile of crea-
tures. He passively endures levels of boredom and 
aggression which justly infuriate waitresses, bar· 
keeps or assistant professors. Indeed, like the schmoo, 
the graduate student often appreciates abuse--par-
ticularly when offered by superiors--as a sign of 
affection. Given these circumstances, I •m delighted 
that the Yale Daily News has devoted a weekend 
supplement to a kind of post-graduate kvetch-schrift. 
Doug Lackey, • philosophy student, discussed "Life 
and Death in the Graduate School"; William A. Henry, 
Ill, suggested "What's Wrong in the Drama School"; 
Jim Swiss dissected Art and Architecture; and Jeffrey 
Romoff explained the " 'Nice' Revolution in Political 
Science." These four pieces explored important prob-
lems, and they offered useful proposals for institu-
tional adjustments. Nevertheless, each of the articles 
is u significant for its omissions as for its deliberate 
recommendations. Lackey, Henry, Swiss and Romoff 
do not examine the basic problem-the student him-
self and his unimaginative approach to "graduate 
training." 

leo Ribuffo, a graduate student in American studies, 
is a contributing editor of The New Journal. 

Before I offer my dissenting opinion, let me em· 
phasize that I am not a scab, that I am not in the pay 
of Dean Onat and that I do not oppose revolutions--
nice or otherwise-in graduate education. Rather, I 
believe that post-college programs in humanities and 
social sciences are about as essential to the develop-
ment of learning as the moss crawling up Sterling 
Library; it would have been a small loss, as Edmund 
Wilson has suggested, if the Ph.D. had been abolished 
as a Germanic barbarism during those patriotic years 
when erudite men shunned st~uerkraut and ate "lib-
erty cabbage." Indeed, if colleagues ever hoist the 
black flag over HGS, I shall happily donate my copies 
of Summerhill and Growing Up Absurd to the revolu-
tionary library. 

Furthermore, let me repeat with gusto the frequent, 
futile grad-student complaints about Yale. For all the 
Newsweek hoopla about this university's bold experi-
mentation (e.g., Afro-American Studies), Yale is an-
achronistic in many ways-an Edith Wht~rton institu-
tion in a Saul Bellow world. Decades of inbreeding 
have infected Yale with a kind of intellectual hemo-
philia, complicated by • myopic incapacity to perceive 
its own ills. Within this depressing overall situation, 
the grad student is a second class citizen, and Mr. 
Lackey et. al. rightly demand the familiar institutional 
reforms. Clearly, Yt~le University-not only the grad 
school-needs more women, and everyone could 
use a student union. Lackey correctly asks for degree 
requirements which make some sense and are ad· 
ministered with some humanity. Moreover, grad 
students should be encouraged to teach, and they 
should be paid decently for their instruction; with 
care and imagination, the appointment of more teach-
ing fellows in Yale College could in fact raise the level 
of instruction. 

Women, financial grants, student unions and teach-
ing jobs are nice things to have, and I endorse pro-
posals which make all of them available. The presence 
or absence of these things, however, does not define 
"life and death in the graduate school." After all, 
graduate work is much the same mora~s at Northwest-
ern, where buxom honeys abound. Nor is the situa-
tion less gloomy at Cornell, despite seven-count 
the m, seven-student centers. The fundamental 
problem, one which cannot be alleviated by institu-
tional tinkering, is that most graduate students ac· 
cept-.and sometimes evangelize-the stuffier mores 
of the academic marketplace and the more preten· 
tious cant of the professorial pecking order. 

Notwithstanding the fears of Senatorial investi· 
gators, academic folks are not likely revolutionaries. 
The professor who writes a letter to the Times de· 
manding "Immediate Cessation of the Immoral War 
in Vietnam," will explain to his students that the 
creation of a new course is a complex matter, requir· 
ing time and study, committees and leaves of ab· 
sence. The professor who signs a petition calling 
the President a monster and the Congress a bevy of 
morons, is less able to discern that his dean is a 
bungler of the first magnitude. The professor who 
writes monographs about George Wallace and work-
ing-class authorit•rianism will complain that he must 
talk to undergraduates nine hours each week--a con-
ception of toil which might astonish the mechanic 
who greases his car or the janitor who sweeps his 
office. Simply put, my point is that professors, like 
most mortals, are not especially aware of their im· 
plicit assumptions about their own roles, occupations 
or privileged institutions. Nor are they particularly 
interested in re.examining those assumptions; our 
generation, after all, has witnessed distinguished 
scholars at Columbia whose analysis of their univer· 
sity's troubles consisted of misplaced analogies to the 
Weimar Republic.
