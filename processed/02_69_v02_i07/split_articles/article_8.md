"lRe air was unusually heavy and warm 
ltor early New England summer as Jimmy 
Miller began to close up one of several 
beauty shops he owned in and around 
Milford, Connecticut. Suddenly nine fed-
eral agents and state policemen entered his 
shop and arrested him as a member of the 
nation's largest heroin ring, a ring which 
had imported an estimated 150 million 
dollars worth of heroin in a period of 
two months. The narcotics agents charged 
Miller with receiving two shipments of 
heroin the previous summer, in August 
of J 963. 

Jimmy Miller was brought to trial in 
May, 1966. The primary evidence against 
him was the eyewitness testimony of a 
convicted heroin smuggler who claimed to 
have seen Miller for fifteen minutes, 
almost three years earlier. Miller was con-
victed on the basis of this testimony and 
was sentenced to twelve years in prison 
without possibility of parole. Before and 
during the trial Miller repeatedly claimed 
that he was innocent, and he still says so 
today. 

Steven Duke, professor of criminal law 
at the Yale Law School, was approached 
to write a brief for Miller's appeal in 1966. 
In the course of his investigations, Duke 
found evidence that the government had 
denied Miller a fair trial. Yet the appeal, 
on the basis of his new evidence, was de-
nied; and Professor Duke, convinced of 
Miller's evidence, has devoted the last two-
and-a-half years to prove the government's 
mistake and win Miller a new trial. 

Duke believes thereat criminal to be a 
small-time Mafia hireling named Mario 
Natalizio. According to Duke, Natalizio 
was involved in the smuggling deal be-
cause he had graciously provided cover for 
two known fugitive gunmen, Anthony 
"Bootsie" DePasqua and Rosario Ippolito, 
in his Miami apartment. His reward was 
to go to Bridgeport and receive two heroin 
shipments for a cut of five thousand dol-
lars each. Duke's private investigators 
have four confessions from Natalizio ad-
mitting that it was he, not Miller, who 
received the shipment; but when the 
federal government called Natalizio be-
fore a grand jury, he disowned the confes-
sions, insisting that he had been forced to 
sign one of them at gunpoint, and made 
the others as a joke. 

Beyond Natalizio's grand jury testi-
mony, which Duke dismisses as being 
totally untrue, other evidence has ap-
peared which the lawyer feels can prove 
Miller's innocence. Nevertheless, he has 
been unable to get the federal courts to 
re-open the case. 

Among the new evidence, Professor 
Duke has a statement by the admitted head 
of the narcotics ring, Lucien Rivard, a 
French Canadian now serving a term at 
the federal prison in Lewisberg, Pennsyl-
vania. Rivard maintains that he had never 
heard of Miller and that the eyewit-
ness whose testimony convicted Miller 
was simply not telling the truth. That one 
eyewitness was Michel Caron, another 
convicted heroin smuggler, who was 
picked up in Texas on October of 1963. 
Caught returning from Mexico with a 
car full of heroin, Caron immediately 
turned state's evidence and began rattling 
off the names of other members of the 
ring. Jimmy Miller's name was not among 
those he named. But Caron did give a 
description of the pick-up man at Bridge-
port, whom he knew only as "Frank," a 
description which did not fit Miller at all, 
but which fit Natalizio almost perfectly. 

Books full of photographs were sent to 
Texas so that Caron could try to pick out 
the Bridgeport contact; he initially chose 
a picture of a man named Anthony Man-
cuso, but later he changed his mind and 
picked Miller's picture. According to 
Miller and Duke, from that point on the 
government officials never allowed Caron 
to doubt his choices. Caron went to the 
trial and testified against Miller, picking 
him out without hesitation and convinc-
ing the jury, which then convicted Miller. 

Duke completely discredits Caron's 
testimony on the basic legal question of 
Caron's "eyewitness" testimony. Not only 
is Caron a convicted heroin smuggler, but 
Duke discovered that he had been hypno-
tized inexpertly and illegally before the 
trial by a United States Attorney in Texas. 
Duke contends this hypnosis influenced 
the witness's judgment, persuading him 
that Miller was the one the officials wanted 
him to identify, and made him believe it 
so firmly that even after he came out of the 
trance he "knew" that Miller was the one. 

Duke's theory is supported by several 
prominent psychiatrists. Nevertheless, 
The United States Federal Court decided 
not to grant a new trial on the basis of 
the psychiatric evidence against the 
testimony of the chief witness. 

According to Professor Duke, the hyp-
nosis is considered new evidence because 
the government did not disclose it prior 
to or during the trial. In fact the chief 
prosecutor, Jon Newman, seemingly did 
not even know about it at the time of the 
trial, and has since expressed some doubt 
about Miller's guilt. It was not discovered, 
says Duke, until two years after the trial. 
"We asked Caron to submit to a psychia-
tric examination. He said he would but 
only if we agreed to pay him five hundred 
dollars. We agreed. When he came to the 
examination the doctor said 'Relax, we're 
going to hypnotize you.' He asked him if 
he knew what 'hypnotize' meant. Being a 
French Canadian who spoke little English, 
he said he didn't know what they meant. 
The doctor began to explain, and suddenly 
Caron exclaimed, 'Oh sure. Mr. (United 
States Attorney) Butler did that to me in 
jail in Texas.' Well I almost had a fit.'' 

According to Duke, the government 
possibly has an emotional commitment to 
Jimmy Miller's guilt and conviction. 
Miller says newspapermen and photo-
graphers were on the scene at the time of 
the arrest, indicating they had been 
tipped off by publicity-hungry govern-

ment officials. The announcement of 
Miller's arrest came from the office of At-
torney General Robert Kennedy, and ac-
cording to the New York Daily News, 
which ran the arrest as front page news, 
Miller was clearly part of "World Dope 
Ring No. 1." In what Duke insists is an 
amazingly biased and inaccurate account, 
the News claimed that Miller was in fact 
the "Frankie" to whom Caron had de-
livered the heroin in Bridgeport. The story 
went further, declaring that Jimmy 
Miller's real name was "Frank Coppola," 
disregarding his birth certificate, marriage 
license and driver's license. 

Duke complains that "Coppola" sounds 
better than "Miller" when Cosa Nostra 
cases are being covered; apparently the 
United States agreed, for it tried MiJier as 
"Frank James Coppola, also known as 
J.ames Miller." The Coppola incident is 
just one example of the "tactics" which the 
government has employed in convicting 
Miller. Duke insists, "The law enforce-
ment machinery of this country is such 
that once the government zeroes in on 
someone, that is it. The machinery is in-
capable of taking a fresh look at the situa-
tion; once the government indicted Jimmy 
Miller, it had locked itself in." 

Miller is understandably more forceful 
in the condemnation of what he calls "Mr. 
Government": "With the tactics they have 
used against me they could have con-
victed General Eisenhower of smuggling 
narcotics.'' For in addition to the hyp-
nosis question, Miller complains of the 
behavior of federal agents investigating 
the case. He says that at one point the 
agents found out that the wife of a busi-
ness associate was seeing another man. 
"The agents said they'd see that she made 
front-page news unless she cooperated 
with them. They even threatened to take 
away her daughter. So she gave in and said 
she'd cooperate. 

"The agents told her to deny her hus-
band bedroom privileges," Miller con-
tinues, "keeping him awake with the story 
of how she saw this Cosa Nostra nar-
cotics smuggler in the beauty shop. Then 
after about a week of this harassment the 
agents were going to show up at the bouse, 
show her husband a picture of the man, 
and she was going to say to her husband, 
'See, that's the one I asked you about. Re-
member?' And what could the guy do? He 
would have to say yes. Fortunately, I hap-
pened to drop in one afternoon, and she 
panicked and admitted it all." 

"We complained about that, and all they 
said was the agent was a little 'overzeal-
ous.' 'Overzealous!' Why, if defense coun-
sel ever used those tactics, he'd find him-
self in jail. And the government did not 
even remove the agent from the case. Since 
the arrest his salary has increased from 
nine thousand to seventeen thousand dol-
lars. He gets all the promotions, all the 
credit. He's still on the case today." 

Martin Abramson, author of The Bar-
ney R oss Story and The AI Jolson Story, 
has written a movie scenario based on the 
Miller case, adding a happy ending, in 
anticipation of the justice he thinks must 
ultimately come. But Jimmy Miller's 
whole story is unfortunately like anum-
ber of movie scenarios that came out of 
Hollywood during the depression years. 
Miler was an orphan who, according to 
Duke, grew up as much in the gutter as in 
the orphanage. He was something of a 
street fighter, later did some prize fighting; 
and in the army he was battalion boxing 
champion. "As soon as I was old enough, 
I signed up for the service to go over and 
fight. I was gung-ho, my country right or 
wrong. When I used to read the paper 
about some guy getting arrested by the 
federal government, I guess I reacted just 
like everyone else. I figured the govern-
ment would never arrest someone unless 
he was guilty. Even in my case, I saw the 
government as just making a mistake. The 
prosecutor isn't to blame, and I don't 
think this is in any way a frame. It's just 
that so many careers are committed to my 
guilt." 

Back in 1948 Miller was arrested for a 
misdemeanor. He was twenty-two years 
old and just out of the Navy; and when the 
policeman asked him his name, he said, 
"Here's my driver's license." The license 
was that of his friend, Frank Coppola, a 
member of the New Haven Fire Depart-
ment. Miller was booked under the name 
"Frank Coppola" at the time, and when 
federal officials heard that Caron was 
looking for a man named "Frank" they 
naturally sent along Miller's photograph 
to Texas. 

But there were other reasons for send-
ing Miller's photo through. Miller was 
known to hang out with a few minor un-
derworld figures in the Bridgeport area, 
mostly gamblers and bookies. Miller ad-
mits to having "played the horses," and 
to having a bit of reputation as a success-
ful crap shooter. 

As far as his underworld friends are 
concerned, Miller says: "I don't condone 
the things they do, but in some cases I can 
sympathize with them. One of my biggest 
hang-ups is the 'There but for the grace of 
God go I' thing. I grew up with these peo-
ple, and even though I've managed to 
escape that environment I've never been 
able to look down on those who didn't. But 
I can't sympathize with narcotics peddlers 
and their sort; I just can't stand people 
who live off the misery of others. 

· "And that's another thing that has me 
mad about my case. By convicting me and 
considering the case closed the govern-
ment has given the actual narcotics ring a 
free license to go ahead and continue 
their trade. I'm enough of a business man 
to guess their trade hasn't declined in the 
last four years. If anything, it has probably 
grown, and the government isn't doing 
anything about it. 

"But I'm just not going to turn my 
back on the kind of people I grew up with. 
Before my son was born six years ago, I 
used to go down to New Haven every 
Thanksgiving and Christmas, pick up all 
the derelicts I could find and take them 
home for a good meal and some clean 
clothes. Then I'd give each of them a 
couple of bucks and take them home. 
Even today I always spend Christmas Eve 
over at the Highland Heights orphanage. 
If anything, my case is one of guilt by as-
sociation, but I am just not going to turn 
my back on those people." 

When Miller was discharged from the 
service with his "share of medals and all," 
he attended hairdresser's school under the 
GI bill. He met his wife there, and after 
graduation they opened up their first 
beauty shop, consisting of one chair and 
two dryers. Total investment: four hun-
dred dollars. Today things are a lot better. 
Miller now has seventeen people working 
for him and bas formed, in partnership 
with his employees, small corporations to 
manage half a dozen branch shops. 

Miller is an artist, and his shops are 
decorated with his paintings, which range 
from an impressionistic seascape to a 
pointillist approach to the United Nations 
Building in New York. "You know, it's the 
strangest thing. At one point when I 
thought of being a professional painter, I 
couldn't sell a thing; as soon as I opened 
my shop and hung my paintings in it, the 
customers started making bids. I've al- · 
ways thought I could do a good painting 
of a courtroom. I'd do everything in black 
and grey. I guess that's because of the 
way I feel about all that sort of thing now." 

In the first years after Miller's arrest his 
business fell off by seventy-five percent. 
·Only now, after four years, has it recov-
ered. Yet Miller cannot go into his own 
shops during the day because it upsets his 
customers; he says they know he isn't 
guilty, but they would rather not see him. 
Since he can't go into the shops during the 
daytime, Miller goes in at night and 
teaches his employees business administra-
tion courses so they can eventually manage 
their own shops. During the day he sits at 
home thinking up new angles on the case 
and preparing his lessons for the night-
time classes. For two and a half years he 
kept a journal in which he wrote down all 
his comings and goings minute by minute 
in case he was ever called upon to account 
for them. Even today he never travels 
alone; when he visits Duke at the Law 
School, he has a friend follow him as a 
witness. 

Jimmy Miller has a lot of friends. At 
one point he was called upon to post a two 
hundred thousand dollar bond, and 
twenty-eight of his friends put up their 
homes as collateral. Miller himself has had 
to sell his home, move in with his mother-
in-law and sell his car to help cover ex-
penses. Miller's son Jimmy, a six-year-old, 
has trouble in school and emotional prob-
lems at home because schoolmates say, 
"Your daddy sells pills that kill people." 
And Miller's wife is under a doctor's care. 

Steven Duke occupies a smaJJ office on 
the second floor of the Sterling Law Build-
ing, his secretary hidden somewhere far 
down the hall. Duke's desk is buried under 
an avalanche of documents on the Miller 
case; the transcript of the first trial fills one 
entire shelf along the wall, and clippings 
from newspapers fill several drawers. 

Although the Miller case has occupied 
much of his time for the past thirty 
months, Duke tries to keep it separate 
from his classes in criminal law and the ad-
versary system. "I've used some students 
for investigators and researchers," he 
admits, "but I've tried to keep it out of 
the classroom. Most of the fifteen students 
who have done work on the case at one 
point or another have just stopped by my 
office and offered to help." 

The professor's involvement with the 
case, involving long hours and consider-
able expense, has also come without 
promise or expectation of reward. He esti-
mates that he has traveled at least fifty 
thousand miles to turn up new evidence 
in the case; for example, be has flown 
to Miami (a prime Costa Nostra hangout 
these days) nearly a dozen times, seeking 
clues to help him identify the real smug-
gler, and has frequently been followed 
while he is there. According to Miller, who 
says, "You just wouldn't believe how 
brave the guy is," Duke just walks up to 
mob types and says, "Hey, I'm Jimmy 
Miller's lawyer. He's taking a bum rap. 
Are you going to let an innocent mao go to 
prison?"
