EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Although humanities and social-science 
research and classwork have been taking 
an increasing share of computer time, 
these departments remain unrepresented 
on the Yale Computer Center Advisory 
Board, whose mandate will be necessary if 
the Computer Center is to receive the Yale 
support it needs to rescue itself from the 
current crisis. The Board- which should 
be the leading advocate of increased com-
puter facilities in the University-is split 
between a strong-willed minority which 
sees no value in saving the IBM 360 and 
a majority which, while supporting there-
tention of the new 360, unfortunately 
represents fewer outside money interests. 
The Board is made up of individuals from 
the physical sciences and medicine as well 
as from economics and psychology, areas 
which use computers primarily for the 
solution of numerical problems. It is these 
disciplines, of course, that have attracted 
the government money that has kept the 
Center functioning for several years and 
allowed Yale to regard the Center as a 
peripheral item in its overall budget. 


So in one sense the current crisis breaks 
down to the time-worn story of the hu-
manities and social sciences versus the 
physical sciences. Government support 
has come for physical sciences computer 
use, but in the area of humanities and 
social sciences, where the "boom" in 
computer education is taking place, the 
University must foot the bill itself. So far 
Yale has refused to give the non-sciences 
the vote of confidence they need to retain 
their "computer privileges." 


No less tragic for the University would 
be the Joss of staff which would result 
from the planned cutback of operations. 
Yale's Computer Center staff is recognized 
as one of the finest in the country, yet the 
University's persistent attitude toward the 
staff has been more like that of a master 
toward a servant than one characteristic 
of professional colleagues in education. 
Some of the Computer Center staff heard 
of the proposed cutbacks by word of 
mouth, not through University channels. 
The general reaction was one of disillu-
sionment, not anger; for as one staff mem-
ber said, "We had a misconception of 
what Yale really wanted" in the way of 
computing facilities. Most bad never re-
alized how little, in the final analysis, the 
Computer Center figured in the Univer-
sity's policies. 


What about the users of the Computer 
Center? By and large, they are aghast. 
John McCarthy, an acting instructor in 
history and a frequent user of the com-
puters for his research on the Reconstruc-
tion period, notes that Yale's attraction 
to students and faculty would be seriously 
dimmed if the 360 system is returned. 
McCarthy, who regularly assigns his His-
tory 91 students computer problems in-
volving quantitative historical data, adds 
that the earlier machines that would be 
left after the IBM 360's departure would 
be inadequate to handle the large amounts 
of data necessary for an adequate social-
science data bank. H e concludes: "I am 
appalled." 


The view of the computer as a data 
bank is one which has begun to attract 
more and more proponents in the human-
ities and social-science fields. Among 
them is Rufus Hendon, Associate Profes-
sor of Southeast Asian Languages, who 
says that he uses the computer almost con-
stantly but the library "only a dozen or 
so times in the last year." Robert G. 
Wheeler, Professor of Physics and Applied 
Sciences, disagrees and states that since 
under two thousand members of the Yale 
community actually use the computer 
system, it cannot be viewed as a basic 
resource center. Wheeler sees the only 
question to be whether Yale can afford to 
maintain its 360 system now, and his an-
swer is no. Unfortunately, Wheeler is not 
just an outspoken faculty member; he is 
the chairman of the Yale Computer Cen-
ter Advisory Board, and his words carry 
weight. 


Wheeler fears the loss to the rest of the 
University from increased spending on 
computer operations. "I'm worried about 
the preservation of Yale as a first-rate in-
stitution," he says. 


But so is everyone else in this battle of 
the booming computers. The University is 
obviously proud of its superb computer in-
stallations, or so it tells its prospective 
freshmen; but it remains unwilling to 
shoulder the financial burden of main-
taining the advanced 360 system. Can 
Yale keep its pace without paying the 
price? Unfortunately, this is one question 
that the computer can't answer. :
