The whole land 
will rock

by 
Lawrence Lasker
Clear the streets--
We'rehere. 
We'vecome ... 
The whole land will rock 
The whole land will jump 
He stirs, yes, now he thrusts, yes now 
He blooms in you, the power Dionysus ... 
Baccbae, dart! 
Bacchae, run! 
Bacchae, dance! 
There are indications that a riot broke out 
in the theater when Euripides' The Bac-
chae was first staged, nearly 2500 years 
ago in Athens. Subsequent productions of 
the play, considered one of the most ex-
treme and powerful tragedies ever written, 
have been somewhat anti-climactic; next 
month the Yale Repertory Theater will 
present a new translation and a new ap-
proach that should produce one of the 
more exciting Bacchae in recent theater 
history. 


"The most incredible thing about this 
play," says Kenneth Cavander, who wrote 
the new translation, "is that through an 
almost unique coincidence of history, 
some sort of time warp, Euripides wrote 
a tragedy for his time that turned out to 
be the perfect tragedy for a later time-
ours. It's quite amazing, but we are going 
through the exact same thing now. The 
revival of a Dionysian style of life, the 
confrontation of ecstasy with Jaw and 
order, everything." Six years ago Cav-
ander finished his new translation of The 
Bacchae, a translation he calls "absolutely 
theatrical," but until now be has been 
unable to get the play produced the way 
he thinks it should be done. 


Last spring, the Drama School did a 
reading of Cavander's translation. The 
chorus bad a jug of wine up on stage and 
got progressively drunk as the play went 
on. Brustein liked it and decided to do the 
play full-scale. He was also inspired, he 
said, by the Pentagon confrontation-it 
reminded him of the Bacchae confronting 
a Greek palace. 


"In almost every translation and pro-
duction of Greek tragedy I have seen," 
says Cavander, "everyone has thought of 
it as a heavy, ritualistic, liturgical and 
consequently quite boring affair. Under 
the guise of reverence to the classics, 
people have set them up as so grand and 
so beautiful that we are not touched by 
them. By whatever means we use, the 
play should get to the audience. It should 
disturb them, make them feel they've been 
through something-not insulted, but 
spoken to. 


"And now if Andre gets just half his 
ideas on stage, this will be years ahead of 
other Greek plays. He really wants to do 
it for real, not mess around with ancient 
Greek museum pieces." 


Andre Gregory, who came to Yale from 
New York this year to direct The Bacchae, 
sat at a red-checkered table in the Yale 
Cabaret last week and talked about the 
play. The sounds of silverware clattering 
on lunch plates and the endless chatter 
of actors swarmed about the room. "The 
only way to do this play, which I think is 
the most difficult play to stage ever writ-
ten, is to approach it the way we [himself 
and Stanley Rosenberg, the director of the 
chorus} are approaching it-a process of 
discovery without looking ahead. We've 
gone through a number of different stages 
in how we think the play should be pre-
sented. At one time I wanted to literally 
bring the ceiling down almost on top of 
the audience-! didn't want them to sit 
back and just observe, I wanted to assault 
them. Well of course, we couldn't do it. 
The theater has all the limitations of real 
life." 


One of the most important influences 
on G regory's handling of The Bacchae is 
the work of Jerzy Grotowski, a young 
Polish director with whom Gregory 
studied briefly in December. "Jerzy Gro-
towski is the most important theater rev-
olutionary since I guess Stanislavski;" said 
Gregory. "He is returning mystery and 
danger-real mystery and danger-to the 
theater. You see, theater should not try 
to imitate films; it can't. So Grotowski, 
with his notion of the Poor Theater, has 
asked himself, Well, what is it that makes 
theater unique, what is essential? He has 
found that theater can do without make-
up, without music, sets, costumes and 
lights. What is left? The actor, first of all, 
and the special relationship between the 
actor and his audience." 


Grotowski differs with Julian Beck, 
Gregory explained, in his estimation of 
this relationship. Where Beck aims to 
destroy the barriers between the two, 
Grotowski feels that the spectator, while 
he can and should be active, must always 
remain a spectator. "If the spectator par-
ticipates in the play, he is acting at par-
ticipating, and so it's phony," said 
Gregory, shifting the little cap he wears 
over his long, thin hair. 


"Anyway," he continued, "Grotowski 
has been working for the past nine years 
with a company of nine, and be has de-
veloped actors that can do what no other 
actors can do. They have a control over 
their bodies and their voices, and over 
their psyches, that is literally beyond the 
human. Rather than express the personal 
vision, they express the primordial reality. 
And I believe that an actor must be able 
to perform what we can perform only 
in our dreams." Gregory stood up and 
smiled; he had to go to a rehearsal. "Ob, 
I could talk to you about Grotowski for 
four hours. But to get a feel for what he 
is doing, you should really see The Cat."

Development of Chrlatlan Doctrine Some Historical Prolegomena 
by Jaroalav Pelikan 
The problem of change has assumed great prominence in much 
of the current ferment in theology, and many of the issues in 
question can best be interpreted as relating to the validity and 
limits of doctrinal development. Mr. Pelikan presents three case 
histories of the particular doctrines that have crucial points of 
division among Christians-Cyprian on Original Sin, Athanasius 
on the Virgin Mary, and Hilary on the Holy Spirit -
demonstrat-
ing the interaction between the sacramental life of the church 
and the intellectual work of the theologian that consistently 
marked the development of doctrine by the early fathers.

Scher 
Verbal Mualc In German Literature 
A New Yale 
Paperbound 
by Steven Paul Scher 
This cogent study focuses on literary presentations of existing 
or fictional musical compositions, i.e. poetic textures which 
have particular pieces of music as their "themes." By means of 
comparative evaluation of passages from the works of W.H. 
Wackenroder, Lugwig Tieck, E.T.A. Hoffman, Heinrich Heine, 
and Thomas Mann, Mr. Scher defines "verbal music" as a 
literary phenomenon of great potential. $6.75

"This stately volume is distinguished by several unusual fea-
tures. First, It straightforwardly focuses on a crucial issue of 
Comparative Politics without being vitiated by the familiar 
behaviorist semantics and jargon. Secondly, contrary to the 
ubiquitous trend In this country flooded by discussion on the 
emergent states, it centers on constitutional democracy in 
Western Europe, a region which for a decade or more had been 
badly neglected by the rampant computerizers. Thirdly, for 
the ten countries under discussion Professor Dahl was fortu-
nate to enlist the services of genuine experts, the majority of 
whom are nationals of the country reviewed •.•. " Karl Loewen-

Scott 
The Broken Center Studies In the Theological Horizon of Modern Literature 
by Nathan A. Scott, Jr. 
"Underlying much of the most representative poetry, drama, 
and fiction of our period," Mr. Scott explains, "is a sense that 
the anchoring center of life is broken and that the world is 
therefore abandoned and adrift." It is this negatively theologi-
cal character of modem literature that compels criticism 
itself to enter an essentially theological order of discourse 
and evaluation; and it is to this tradition that Mr. Scott's new 
book belongs. $1.75

The Origin end Goat or History 
by Karl Jaspers 
"We and the present in which we live are situated In the midst 
of history. This present of ours becomes null and void if it loses 
itself within the narrow horizon of the day and degenerates into 
a mere present. The aim of this book is to assist In heighten-
Ing our awareness of the present." ... from the author's 
Foreword. "One feels especially inclined to applaud an aca-
demician who still believes that philosophy's proper function is 
to deal with the central problems of the human predicament."

... there are great things 
That must be brought to the day light, 
Made part of our waking and sleeping. 
Calmly accept them, peacefully weave them 
Into your life-and it will be a good life, 
Dissolving and solving discords, 
Freeing you, 
Making you one with yourself, 
And with the world around you. 


"At first I hated it," said one of the girls 
in the Bacchae chorus as she stood in a 
corner of the rehearsal room, "all the ex-
ercises and acrobatics-yech. One day I 
told Stanley I was going to quit. He told 
me to stick around one more time and, 
just like in the movies, I began to like it. 
And it really has done a lot of good for 
me." A dozen drama students, barefoot 
and in tights, sat on the polished wood 
floor and waited for Stanley Rosenberg to 
arrive for the morning work-out.


Most of the students in the group began 
taking "physicalization" classes last Octo-
ber from Rosenberg, who came to Yale 
this year to introduce the new program. 
Rosenberg, who is one of the few Ameri-
cans to have studied with Grotowski for 
any length of time (he has taken part in 
Grotowski's workshop for the past two 
summers), is director of La Mama Plexus 
Theater in New York and leader of La 
Mama Plexus Workshop, a group of actors 
who support themselves with other jobs 
in order to work together. This January, 
when people started hunting actors for the 
Bacchae chorus, Rosenberg took the best 
students from his class and-presto--the 
wine-drinking, love-making Bacchae were 
born. Well, not quite. There were still 
months of training ahead, six days a week, 
before the group would be in the physical 
and emotional shape Rosenberg thought 
the chorus demanded. The most important 
exercise the students have worked with is 
the basic Grotowski exercise, The Cat.


The students lay in a large circle on the 
· floor as Rosenberg watched from a 
window-seat. He is a short man with a 
round black beard and quick, kind eyes. 
"Try two variations this time, and explore 
vocal problems. Make sounds, the sounds 
of a cat maybe," he suggested. A girl in 
black tights was the first to move: slowly 
she raised herself on her arms and curled 
her spine back, hissing softly. Soon the 
others began to stir, stretch, and the room 
was defined by moans, hissing, wailing. 
They arched their backs and began to 
thump slowly about the floor in a series of 
somersaults and headstands. As you can 
watch someone while he talks and see, but 
not hear him consider and reject alterna-
tive phrases, so the actors' movements in 
The Cat spoke for their hesitations and 
uncertainties as they sought a direction 
to their movement. One girl ended her 
Cat standing before the window, head 
dropped back, her arms stretched out, 
trembling at the morning sun as she wailed 
in a loud, clear voice. 


"The Cat is based mainly on yoga posi-
tions which Grotowski translated into a 
theatrical exercise," said Stanley Rosen-
berg, sitting on a couch in the apartment 
he and his young wife Susie, had just 
moved into a few days earlier. "It's used 
to explore an actor's objectives-what be 
wants to do, how be chooses to do it-
and to work out problems of voice, bal-
ance and movement.
