Movies 
Two years ago, Andrew Sarris, film critic 
for the Village Voice and the leading 
propounder of what Fran~ois Truffaut 
calls "La politique des auteurs" (usually 
rendered the "auteur theory" of film), 
spoke at a Yale Flm Society showing of 
Samuel Fuller's Shock Corridor. Foran 
Sarris said about film as "the director's 
medium" and of Samuel Fuller as a great 
director, the audience appreciated Sarris' 
performance much more than what he 
had to say about film art and enjoyed both 
more than the Fuller movie that was 
shown. 

But a new generation of film enthusiasts 
has arrived, across the country and at 
Yale, and Sarris' theory of the American 
film director, which originally appeared 
in print in the spring 1963 issue of Film 
Culture has been seriously received by 
film enthusiasts. The American Cinema: 
Directors and Directions,J929-1968 fol-
lows the plan of the Film Culture article 
in discussing films by their director and in 
ranking the directors in more or less fanci-
ful categories: Pantheon, Expressive 
Esoterica, Strained Seriousness, Less Than 
Meets the Eye, etc. The book also con-
tains a "Directorial Chronology" for each 
year, really just an excuse for Sarris to 
epater le bourgeois by giving his favorites 
for each year. 

The rankings will be familiar to anyone 
who has ever seen a Yale Film Society 
program, although they will outrage many 
self-appointed film experts. Thus Hawk's 
ElDorado, Ford's Seven Women and 
Sirk's imitation of Life are among his 
favorites, while many idols of the popular 
press, e.g. Huston and Zinneman, are 
given short shrift. 

Yet the substance of the book lies not 
in the rankings and other little games 
Sarris is playing with his readers but rather 
in the essays on each director and the new 
essay he has written for the introduction, 
a detailed discussion of some of the prin-
ciples of the "auteur theory." Sarris is too 
discursive and insufficiently rigorous to be 
a great theoretician; the closest he ever 
gets to a definition of the "auteur theory" 
is a few phrases scattered through the in-
troduction." ... The worst film of a great 
director may be more interesting though 
less successful than the best film of a fair 
to middling director." He could have 
changed the "may be" to "is"; after all, 
isn't that the definition of a great artist? 
Two Gentlemen of Verona is more inter-
esting than anything by Marston, and 
The Stranger (Welles, not Visconti) is 
more interesting than anything by William 
Wyler. 

Sarris says in his introduction that in 
the making of a film, "Ideally the strong-
est personality should be the director, and 
it is when the director dominates the film 
that the cinema comes closest to reflecting 
the personality of a single artist. A film 
history could reasonably limit itself to a 
history of film directors." And finally, and 
~
perhaps most accurately, he notes, 'The 
director is both the least necessary and 
most important component of film-
making." 

But Sarris does not stop there. He is 
interested in the whole of film-making and 
perhaps as deeply in the world of film 
distribution. He discusses some of the eco-
nomic problems in film-making, but he is 
especially interested in the present and 
past position in America of critics and re-
viewers, insisting on the distinction 
between the two. "Reviewing is thus a 
consumer report for the uninitiated; criti-
cism a conversation with one's equals." 

As he points out, it was reviewers who 
destroyed the careers of Griffith, von 
Sternberg, Stroheim and Welles long be-
fore the studios did. Reviewers know their 
readers would rather read a good pan than 
a good rave. This may sound sancti-
monious until Sarris points out, "The last 
thing an auteur critic desires is to keep a 
reader from seeing a movie." This state-
ment will surprise none of his regular 
readers. His reviews in the Village Voice 
are rarely complete pans. He always finds 
something interesting about any film. 

It is his essays on individual directors 
that linger in the mind. He can be devas-
tatingly accurate in a pan. "Burt Topper 
has been discovered by Cahiers du 
Cinema as one of its little jokes on Ameri-
can film scholarship .... The joke is 
wearing thin at a time when Ameri-
can films are constantly reviled in the 
pages of Cahiers aJI the better to sing the 
praises of the New Albanian Cinema." But 
he is at his best with directors he loves. 
His essay on Ford is richly suggestive, and 
his best phrases have an evocative power 
not unlike some scenes by his subject: 
"How Green Was My Valley is notable 
for introducing Ford's visual treatment of 
the past as a luminous memory more real 
than the present and presumably more 
than the heroic future. His style has 
evolved almost miraculously into a double

vision of an event in all its vital immediacy 
and yet almost in its ultimate memory 
image on the horizon of history." 

The Ford essay is perhaps the best, 
carefully controlled with Sarris's supple 
sense of language. Occasionally he falters. 
Describing Hitchcock as "the supreme 
technician of the American cinema" does 
not seem to be much of an improvement 
over the usual sobriquet, "master of sus-
pense." And too often Sarris is content 
with assertion of greatness. Sec for ex-
ample his essay on Sirk, which is not likely 
to convince any not already of the devil's 
part. 

But finally the book is much more than 
the balance of its virtues and defects. As 
the first "weighted critical evaluation" of 
the American Cinema with any claims to 
be taken seriously, it is not the end of 
American film criticism. But it may be the 
end of the beginning.
