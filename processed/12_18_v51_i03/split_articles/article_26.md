elite high school. For some reason, the only name I 
could think of was Ruth Bader Ginsberg. Incorrect—it 
was Sandra Day O’Connor. Good look for me, already 
the least-useful person at the table.)
My favorite event was a “photo opportunity” with 
actors Tanc Sade and Nick Holmes, who played Logan’s 
Yale friends, members of his fictional secret society, 
The Life and Death Brigade. Two of the biggest stars in 
attendance, they’d appeared in fifteen and five episodes, 
respectively, and I’d never heard of either of them. Still, 
the attendees treated them like gods. And I’m not one 
to judge: I once handed Glee actor Darren Criss a nine-
page fanfiction I had written about him having coffee 
with Daniel Radcliffe and Harry Potter.

During the photo opportunity at the local antique 
store, I positioned myself on the steps outside with a 
cup of French onion soup and watched. Sade, tall and 
sporting a bowler hat, and Holmes, whose own Insta­
gram bio describes him as “wildly handsome,” were 
observational gold. 	

While Sade spent a lot of time fending off female 
attention — to a woman wearing a shirt that read, “My 
ideal weight is Tanc Sade on top of me,” Sade, in his 
admittedly charming Australian accent, said, “Wow, 
that’s great! I should get one for my fianceè!” — Holmes 
spent a lot of time encouraging it. On Saturday night, at 
the cast panel, Holmes estimated he had kissed seven­
teen attendees on the mouth. I had witnessed one kiss 
that morning and literally did a double-take. Later, I 
learned through by scrolling through Instagram photos 
taken at the festival that Holmes not only kissed his fans 
(passionately and consensually) but also took naked 
pictures of (at least one of) them. When not acting, 
Holmes is an “empowerment photographer,” specializ­
ing in black-and-white, bare-chested shots of women. 
At least one of these scantily-clad photoshoots featuring 
a scantily-clad fan took place at the festival itself. But 
a woman I interviewed — who was tagged in one of 
Holmes’ Instagram posts labeled #GGFF— declined 
to tell me where, exactly, the photo had been taken. 
(The Instagram account on which Holmes shares the 
photos, @narcissusholmes, boasts 16.6 thousand fol­
lowers; a second account, @nickholmeshair, devoted 
strictly to his hair, has 773. On each account, Holmes’ 
bio includes the words “In omnia paratus,” the Life 
and Death Brigade motto, which means “ready for all 
things.”)

There’s no denying that the Gilmore Girls fans know 
how to party. I was initially nervous about finding peo­
ple to hang out with, since Eamonn was decidedly unin­
terested in staying overnight, but festival attendees were 
unfailingly kind to me. A chef and her fifteen-year-old 
daughter took me out to dinner. At Club Getaway, a 
retreat center and summer camp where many fans and I 
slept, I shared breakfast with seventeen-year-old Malika 
and, twenty-three-year-old Lexi, and their mothers. 
Malika and Lexi had been inspired by a scene in which 
Rory and the Life and Death Brigade “boys” jump off 
a large platform holding umbrellas. As luck would have 
it, Club Getaway was also home to a ropes course that 
included a thirty-five-foot platform, and the affable 
man who ran it let Lexi and Malika jump off with their 
umbrellas (and, of course, bungee cords). I also jumped 
off, though not with an umbrella, because a) I didn’t 
have one and b) I was worried it would somehow get 
tangled in the bungee cord, resulting in my tragic death 
at Gilmore Girls Fan Fest.

But for me, the key moment of the festival came 
during our “Journalism at Yale” panel, which quickly 
turned into a “Yale” panel, possibly because it became 
clear that nobody onstage knew that much about journal­
ism. We got quite a range of questions, from “Are secret 
societies real?” to “How much did the YDN investigate 
the allegations leveled against Brett Kavanaugh?” The 
more I talked about Yale, the more I wished, for the first 
time, that my life were more like Rory’s, if only to please 
the audience. When a woman approached me after the 
panel and asked if I had a boyfriend, I wanted to say that 
I did, but that his billionaire father thought my family 
was trash, as befalls Rory. It turned out the woman was 
asking on behalf of her son, whom she pointed out to 
me, standing across the room and apparently unaware 
of his mom’s audacious matchmaking attempt. When I 
said I didn’t really want to start something at Gilmore 
Girls Fan Fest, his mom said, cuttingly, “He’s too young 
for you anyway.”

That incident aside, I’ll be earnest: it’s a strange thing, 
realizing that your reality is someone else’s fantasy. The 
Monday after the festival, I gave a mini-tour of cam­
pus to two young women and one of their husbands. 
I’d met the women at trivia (they roasted me about the 
Supreme Court thing), and found myself more or less 
bursting with pride to show them my school. “Look!” 
I said, pointing at Branford. “It’s Rory’s college!” This 
is something I would have never said five days earlier.

I dropped them off on Hillhouse Avenue, a street I 
get to see every day and that Mark Twain apparently 
said was one of the most beautiful in the world. On 
my way back to my dorm, I stepped on a dead squir­
rel. But even that seemed like something the glamor­
ous-but-occasionally-world-weary Rory might do, and 
thus—extremely desirable.
