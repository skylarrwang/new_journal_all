EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Wendy Marans’ name is a diagnostic test 
of sorts.

Section one, “wɛndi,” isn’t too hard. It can be bro­
ken down into five distinct sounds: /w/, /ɛ/, /n/, /d/, 
and /i/. They’re all articulated near the front of the 
oral tract, so the challenge is just remembering to 
connect the /n/ and /d/ consonant blends. Fortu­
nately, the two phonemes don’t occur in distant sites 
of the mouth, which is the hardest part about other 
consonant blends like “gr” or “tw.” The “nd,” sound, 
in comparison, is manageable. Both /n/ and /d/ are 
produced by placing the tip of the tongue on the al­
veolar ridge, the front roof of the mouth that reminds 
Wendy of the bumpy ridges left on a beach when the 
tide goes out.


Section two, “mærənz,” gets trickier. With seven 
distinct sounds, an /r/ wedged in the middle, and a 
voiced /z/ fricative tacked onto the end, “Marans” 
is complex enough to give any child with a speech 
impediment some trouble. For these kids, Wendy’s 
surname easily becomes “Maranth,” “Mah-ens,” 
“Mawans,” or even “Mamem.” Some parents get 
tripped up too, incorrectly placing the emphasis on 
the second syllable: “Mar-ANS.” She’s heard almost 
every possible mistake. Maybe that’s why she just goes 
by Wendy.


Wendy’s bubblegum-pink lips curl into a taut 
frown as she checks the time. Her watch stopped last 
week and though it’s now ticking again, she has been 
eyeing her wrist sporadically, as if always running a 
moment late. Her first afternoon appointment doesn’t 
begin for thirty minutes, but it’s time for her to start 
rearranging the room.


The next client is one of her tallest, so Wendy 
heaves the table onto its side and goes about shifting 
the length of each of its four legs. Wendy’s heels slip 
out of her shoes as she fidgets with the squeaky pegs, 
but she declines my offer to assist her. She’s accus­
tomed to performing this manual task solo. But I also 
get the sense that she doesn’t trust me to do it careful­
ly enough—or simply as carefully as she will.

For decades, pediatric speech therapist Wendy Marans has fixed stutters and lisps in her 
Church Street office. 

Wendy screws the pegs in place—a few inches higher 
than they were before. Her carefully-groomed bangs 
are left slightly disheveled, and I can’t help but won­
der if the ritual, which she repeats several times a day, 
is actually necessary. Yet after four decades of work­
ing as a pediatric communication disorders specialist, 
Wendy insists on this level of precision.


The laminate blue-and-grey table is the home base 
of Wendy’s lessons. It’s where they all begin, with 
Wendy sitting diagonally from each child, and where 
Wendy tries to end each hour-long session, though 
her youngest patients have a habit of wandering. It’s 
where Wendy conducts intakes to suss out articula­
tion difficulties, where she runs repetitive speech ex­
ercises and plays purposeful games when the children 
grow tired of these exercises, and ultimately, where 
most of her breakthroughs happen. But if the table 
is too tall, the child’s neck will strain upwards and he 
may not be able to see; too short, and he’ll slouch. 
Wendy even customizes the size of the plastic school 
chairs that circle the table so each child can firmly 
plant his or her feet on the floor. Teaching someone 
to communicate is not a one-size-fits-all project.


There are no diagrams of the oral tract or pamphlets 
about communication disorders displayed in Wendy’s 
office, a one-room private practice she opened in 
1997. Toys and games are Wendy’s tools, each serving 
a distinct pedagogical purpose. A glittery pinwheel 
helps children practice the controlled breath release 
necessary in strident sounds; glossy plastic micro­
phones coax mumblers into projecting. Wendy keeps 
the beige walls sparsely decorated to avoid distrac­
tions. On the window ledge by her desk sit a model 
wooden train and a miniature metal toboggan. When 
Wendy knows a client is particularly fond of vehicles, 
she usually remembers to preemptively hide them. 
Incorporating a child’s interests into a lesson plan is 
one thing, Wendy once explained, but carelessly leav­
ing a toy within reach is asking for a disturbance in 
the kid’s focus, or even a tantrum. Behind Wendy’s 
desk, pristine glass windows span the entire northern 
side of the office. Last fall, after a gust of wind once 
derailed her train of thought, Wendy glanced toward 
the windows and remarked that they were the most

On Wendy’s old website, below her educational 
training and professional experience, appeared a bul­
let-pointed list of her extracurricular passions: Cello, 
Flamenco, Quilting. (The page has since been taken 
down.) Wendy handmade the office’s only notable 
décor—a large multicolored quilt that hangs by her 
desk—but she repeatedly stresses to me that she has 
made better quilts. She keeps this flawed one on dis­
play only so that she can point to something when 
children make mistakes, something that shows she 
makes mistakes too.


“They’re made to be squares and top right yellow 
one isn’t,” Wendy says, gesturing toward one of the 
two hundred and ten patches as if it’s the first thing I 
would notice. The top right yellow one hadn’t caught 
my eye, but when I walk closer, I see Wendy’s right. I 
never would have recognized the error—the patch is 
only slightly rectangular.


For most people, developing one’s voice and abil­
ity to communicate is something that just sort of 
happens. But Wendy works with kids for whom that 
doesn’t naturally occur—kids whose capacity to ver­
bally express themselves isn’t inborn, but needs to be 
taught to them. This thing that most people take for 
granted, speech, is incredibly complex, Wendy says. 
So maybe this care—her insistence on adjusting the 
table by several inches, or hanging a near-perfect 
quilt as an example of a mistake—is necessary.


Wendy’s natural speaking voice is crisp, potent, 
and unmistakably British. Having been raised and 
schooled in England, Wendy talks with broad vowels 
and delicately discards her /r/ sounds, letting them 
slip just before they settle on the tongue. Her specif­
ic dialect, Received Pronunciation, is untraceable to 
any physical region or socioeconomic class. Wendy 
attributes her speech to her grandmother, who, as a 
young woman, swore off the Derbyshire parlance—a 
regional giveaway of her own humble beginnings. 
Besides a couple adolescent nieces who’ve acquired 
the “Mockney” dialect—a middle-class London trend 
that began during Margaret Thatcher’s premiership—
everyone in Wendy’s family still speaks with Received 
Pronunciation.


In conversation, Wendy’s rich tone is almost me­
lodic, bouncing between syllables like notes, perform­
ing dynamic intervals with each clause. Her cadence 
could dwell within the five lines of a treble clef. 
When she reaches the end of a sentence, or wants 
to emphasize a point, she slows her pace and chews 
on her words, letting them resonate one by one. “I 
think…it’s a…trahhhgedy,” she said once, describing 
other foreigners’ tendency to lose their accents after 
years in the United States.


It’s easy to catch yourself intensely listening to 
Wendy—not explicitly because of what she’s saying, 
but because of how good she sounds saying it. And 
the primrose hue of her lips, a staple which some­
how always looks both girlish and elegant on Wendy, 
is perhaps her voice’s most effective billboard. Listen 
to me, it says. Watch what’s happening here.


Otherwise, Wendy’s physical presence is fairly un­
imposing. She has a small, slender frame, and the 
child-sized seat in which she conducts lessons never 
looks as miniature as it seems like it should. She reg­
ularly joins patients on the matted blue carpet of her 
office—sometimes to lie horizontally and use gravity 
to urge a child’s tongue to fall backward; other times, 
simply to conduct a lesson on the floor if an unco­
operative student strays from the table. At the end 
of eight-hour days, Wendy’s hands still flutter with 
sweeping gestures as she speaks, and her patient, lu­
pine eyes blink with purpose.


With ten minutes remaining before the appoint­
ment, Wendy agrees to show me the last unseen area 
of her office: the closet. Behind a locked wooden 
door, opaque plastic bins, phonetic diagnostic tests, 
and niche speech and language-related games are 
tightly packed from the floor to the ceiling, like a 
game of Tetris.


“Wow,” I exhale. “There are so many…”


Wendy stares into the closet and blinks, as if she’s 
unsure whether my comment was a compliment or 


When I first met Wendy roughly sixteen years ago, 
I was an extroverted kindergartener with a spitty inter­
dental lisp, biting softly on my tongue with each /s/, 
and the inability to pronounce my own name.


Section one, æntoniə, wasn’t an issue. The hardest 
part of my first name is just remembering to connect 
the /n/ and /t/ sounds, but my parents had always 
called me Anna anyway, voiding the issue of the con­
sonant blend. Section two, ɛɪrz brɑʊn, was my trouble 
spot, and until I began working with Wendy, I proudly 
introduced myself as Anna Ayrethhh-Brown to every­
one I met.


I don’t remember much about our weekly lessons 
besides the fact that Wendy rewarded me with Chee­
rios and M&Ms for maneuvering my tongue against 
the alveolar ridge. She was similar back then—same 
office, same lupine eyes, same melodic tones—and 
she taught me to fix my speech impediment by look­
ing, listening, and imitating her, just as my older 
brother, Henry, had already done with her.


Henry’s challenges were more debilitating than 
mine. As he entered elementary school, both his /r/ 
and /s/ phonemes were unintelligible, which frac­
tured his ability to communicate with peers, teachers, 
and our parents. My mother still winces whenever 
she recalls one evening when Henry asked her to read 
him a story before bed. Because of Henry’s /r/ and /s/ 
omissions, she heard him ask for a “toy,” and scold­
ed him for trying to play so late at night. Henry, des­
perate to be understood, whined in frustration, “No, 
Mom! A toe-ey!”


Henry began speech therapy with Wendy in kin­
dergarten and continued until his /s/ and /r/ sounds 
improved. Other facets of his impediment, like substi­
tuting “ch” sounds for “sh,” persisted well into middle 
school. This impairment presented itself most overtly 
on Sundays, when Henry would gab about singing in 
“shursh.” At our school’s annual book swap, where 
used titles could be traded for tokens called “chits,” 
Henry’s classmates mocked him for confidently an­
nouncing how many “shits” he had collected.


My family’s history with speech impediments, 
however, predates both Henry and me. When my fa­
ther was a child, he never mastered his “s” and “th” 
sounds. Speech therapy was well out of my grand­
parents’ financial means, so my father learned to 
mask these insecurities by slowing his speaking pace 
around certain hazardous words. As an adult, he still 
avoids “ths”—months, truths, myths.


Last year, after I began reporting this profile and 
researching speech therapy, I sat my father down for 
an impromptu diagnostic test.


“Say ‘anesthesia,’” I instructed.


“Anesthesia,” he copied back. No trouble.


“Okay,” I said. “Say ‘cloths.’”


“Closs.”


“No. Cloths,” I repeated.


“Closth.”


Betrayed by his tongue, he shrugged and left the 
room, revealing the boy in him I’ve rarely seen—the 
boy who never got help with his articulation, the boy 
who would right that wrong by sending both of his 
children to speech therapy one day. Later, when I 
asked my mother what she knew about his ambiguous 
impediment, I learned that when my parents were de­
liberating baby names for me, my mother’s top choic­
es included “Martha” and “Lilith.” My father vetoed 
both.


In a home video that often makes its rounds during 
family reunions, I’m five years old and still unaware of 
my lisp. I stride into the frame and begin to sing: “Lit­
tle Jackie Paper loved that rathcal puff, and brought 
him thtrings and thieling wakth, and other fanthy thh­
hhtuff!”


Interdental /s/ sounds now feel foreign in my 
mouth, and I don’t think of my speech patterns as 
anyone’s but my own, but I sometimes wonder wheth­
er lispy tones would still feel foreign if I had never met 
Wendy—or whether I would have ended up an adult, 
vetoing baby names like my father did. Sarah. Silas. 
Spencer. Susannah. Sebastian.


In the opening scene of The King’s Speech, the 
2010 film about George VI’s journey to overcoming 
his stutter, an unnamed speech pathologist fills the 
king’s mouth with glass marbles and instructs him 
to enunciate several words. Later in the film, Lio­
nel Logue, the Australian-born elocutionist who ul­
timately succeeds in improving the stammer, leads 
the king in a myriad of other unconventional speech 
exercises: rolling log-style across a dusty carpet, swing­
ing his arms like a windmill, lying down and breath­
ing deeply while the queen sits on his diaphragm. At 
one point, as King George practices yelling “Ahhh” 
for fifteen uninterrupted seconds, Logue chimes in 
above the din: “Anyone who can shout vowels at an 
open window can learn to deliver a speech!”


Since the movie’s release in 2010, speech therapists 
like Wendy have become used to answering questions 
about the film, which brought the discipline of speech 
pathology into the public eye. And though most say 
that the techniques shown in The King’s Speech are 
outdated by contemporary standards, the film cap­
