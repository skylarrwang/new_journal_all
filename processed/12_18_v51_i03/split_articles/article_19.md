tures a fundamental part of the field’s history: its roots 
in elocution.

During the late 18th century, generations before 
King George VI assumed the throne, the study of 
elocution and oratory gained widespread popularity 
in England. Soon after, the movement migrated to 
the United States, where writers began studying elo­
cution for individuals with communication disorders. 
Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone, 
founded Boston’s “School of Vocal Physiology and 
Mechanics of Speech” in 1872, which specialized 
in speech instruction for deaf pupils. By 1887, there 
were 1,646 self-proclaimed elocutionists working in 
the United States.

It was not until the early twentieth century, how­
ever, that speech correction evolved into a discipline 
distinct from elocution. In 1922, Sara Stinchfield 
Hawk became the first American to receive a doctor­
ate in Speech Pathology. And in 1937, Robert West, 
who served as the first president of the American 
Speech Correction Association, published The Reha­
bilitation of Speech. The classic text is still in print 
today, and West is known to many as the founding 
father of speech pathology in the United States.

Wendy’s discipline has grown to address myriad 
speech and language difficulties over the past centu­
ry. Some speech therapists work primarily with trans­
gender people, assisting in the transition process and 
highlighting the rhythmic and intonational differenc­
es between most men’s and women’s speech patterns. 
Other pathologists specialize in post-surgical voice 
therapy for thyroid and laryngeal cancer patients, 
or work with individuals after strokes and traumatic 
brain injuries. Pediatric therapists, like Wendy, treat 
articulation-related impediments, phonological dis­
orders, and other language and communication dif­
ficulties.

Roughly 8 percent of young children in the United 
States have a speech disorder. By the time kids reach 
first grade, the prevalence of speech impediments falls 
to 5 percent. Still, only half of affected kids receive in­
tervention services from speech therapists. The U.S. 
Department of Labor reported in 2016 that there are 
roughly 145,000 speech-language pathologists in the 
United States. A reported 43 percent of these ther­
apists work in schools, but they’re often overworked 
with heavy caseloads—and children with minor but 
consequential articulation impediments can fall to 
the wayside.


When Wendy was a young girl, she once gushed to 
her parents, “Wouldn’t ‘Multitudes’ be a wonderful 
name for a boy?”

Now 62, Wendy is unsure where she developed her 
fascination with speech and language. She often cites

the influence of her father, who read Winnie the Pooh 
to her at bedtime and assumed perfectly suited voices 
for each of the book’s characters. As Wendy matured, 
she began experimenting with different accents as 
well, and quickly noticed she had a knack for imper­
sonating regional English dialects. In late elementary 
school, after meeting a Scottish girl and her family 
on vacation, Wendy briefly abandoned her Received 
Pronunciation for a Scottish brogue. 

A decade later, Wendy found herself 19 years old 
and living with her parents after dropping out of a uni­
versity program in Hotel Management. In an attempt 
to keep her daughter occupied, Wendy’s mother sug­
gested she shadow the speech therapist in Bedford. 
Over several days, Wendy traveled from appointment 
to appointment with the pathologist and listened to 
her deconstruct speech with mind-boggling speci­
ficity. Wendy witnessed the complexity of children’s 
communication difficulties and came to believe—for 
the first time in her life—that speech patterns could 
be built.

For Wendy, it was a life-changing revelation. She 
immediately enrolled at the National Hospital’s Col­
lege of Speech Sciences. After receiving her bache­
lor’s, she worked as a speech pathologist in London 
for seven years, and then returned to The Institute of 
Neurology to complete a one-year intensive master’s 
program.

During this time, Wendy met “an American”—the 
most specific she gets when referring to her ex-hus­
band—with whom she moved to the United States in 
1984. The couple settled in Connecticut and raised 
two sons. The kids have their father’s accent.

Now, Wendy is a member of both the American 
Speech–Language–Hearing Association and the 
Connecticut Speech–Language–Hearing Associa­
tion. She sometimes attends ASHA’s annual conven­
tion, which regularly attracts nearly fifteen thousand 
speech-language pathologists, but last year she opted 
out. “I’m very…picky,” she once confessed to me be­
fore correcting herself. “There are certain people I 
really want to hear.”

What Wendy genuinely cares about is the science 
of phonetics and linguistics as it pertains to commu­
nication. Spoken language can be broken down into 
several units—sentences, words, syllables, and, at 
its most deconstructed level, phonemes. There are 
forty-four phonemes in the English language, twen­
ty-four of which are consonants (which challenge 
children more often than vowels). These two dozen 
consonantal phonemes make up roughly 62 percent 
of English speech, and can be categorized by their 
voice, manner, and place.

Voice refers to whether the vocal folds vibrate or not 
when producing a noise. Because of this distinction, 
the same physical movements in the oral tract can 
produce different sounds, such as /s/ and /z/, or /p/ 
and /b/. Manner, on the other hand, describes how air 
is released when making a sound. Plosive consonants, 
like /p/ and /t/, are characterized by full blockage of 
the airstream, followed by a quick release of air. Fric­
ative consonants, including /f/ and /v/, create a hiss­
ing-like tone by releasing air through a tight opening.

Lastly, place describes where a phoneme occurs 
within the scope of the oral tract. Bilabial consonants, 
/p/, /b/, and /m/, are articulated between the lips. La­
biodental consonants, /f/ and /v/, manifest when the 
bottom lip touches the upper incisors. Dental con­
sonants, like the voiceless “th” sound in “thin,” are 
made by extending the tongue tip slightly between 
the upper and lower incisors. Alveolar consonants, 
such as /t/, /d/, and /s/, occur when the tongue blade 
is raised to the alveolar ridge. The glottal consonant 
/h/ occurs when the vocal folds do not vibrate but are 
close enough to produce friction as air is exhaled. 
The list goes on.

A properly trained speech pathologist, Wendy says, 
should be able to transcribe any consonant, vowel, or 
diphthong by ear—and identify its voice, manner, and 
place. One of Wendy’s biggest complaints about her 
field is how underappreciated this scientific part goes, 
and how frequently acquaintances—the same kind 
that ask about The King’s Speech—confuse speech pa­
thology with the less-scientific discipline of elocution. 
“When I was starting out, people heard you were a 
speech therapist and they would go, ‘How now brown 
cow,’” Wendy once remarked, rolling her eyes.

Wendy points to her lips, painted her signature 
pink. “Are these two the same or different?” she asks, 
adopting a hard American /r/ for the session. “Arr…
arr…arr. Arrarrarr.”

The five-year-old boy sitting at the table, Samuel, 
tucks his chin and continues twisting his yellow rain 
boots around the legs of his chair. (To protect the 
child’s privacy, Samuel is a pseudonym.) He starts to 
pick at the Wallingford Police Station temporary tat­
too that’s been on his arm for ten days.

Wendy tries again. “What part of my mouth is 
mostly moving? Arrarrarr.”

Samuel started attending weekly lessons with Wen­
dy in the spring of 2017. When they first began, he 
had a medley of severe articulation issues: he strug­
gled with the strident system, which includes sounds 
like “sh” and “ch”; he displayed non-rhotacism, omit­
ting his “r” sounds; and he substituted “th” for “f,” 
expressing his characteristically good manners with 
“please” and “fank you.” Many speech therapists wait 
until a child is eight years old to treat these issues, as

there’s a chance they’ll resolve naturally, but Samuel 
persuaded Wendy with his eagerness and aptitude. 
At their first lesson, when Wendy asked him why he 
thought they were meeting, Samuel was certain. “I’m 
here so you can teach me to say ‘shursh,’” he said, 
unknowingly echoing my brother.

Samuel has since improved his strident sounds 
and learned to articulate “r” at the end of words, but 
he still can’t isolate his tongue on r-initial words like 
“rat,” or r-remedial words like “carrot.” Wendy hopes 
that “Arrarrarr” will push Samuel to articulate the 
“r” sound before a vowel, but his lips have a habit of 
rounding into the “w” shape when he doesn’t pause 
between each “r.”

Samuel finally tilts his head back in frustration, 
shakes his bronze curls, and howls. “Arr! Arr! Arr!” 
Not quite. Wendy furrows her eyebrows and playfully 
corrects him: “That sounds like a hiccupping seal.”

After twenty years of running her private practice, 
Wendy rarely encounters articulation issues that she 
doesn’t know how to fix, once she has cracked what 
she calls the child’s “systematic error code.” For al­
most any common problem like a lisp or non-rhota­
cism, Wendy knows a set of strategies—some techni­
cal and some not-so-technical—that she uses until she 
identifies one that works best. When she first started 
working with Samuel last spring, Wendy began with 
her usual technique: make a long “ee” and imagine 
the tongue is glued to the palate but allowed to slide 
from front to back. As the tongue moves backward in 
the mouth, “ee” becomes “eer.”

This visual didn’t work with Samuel—he couldn’t 
move his tongue without rounding his lips—so Wen­
dy shifted to a less mechanical approach: do a seal 
impression. Samuel correctly articulated an “r” on his 
first try.

Between their weekly sessions, Samuel frequently 
practices speech exercises for fun, which Wendy says 
is practically unheard of. His r-final word articulation 
has now improved to the point that he corrects Wendy 
when she forgets her affected American /r/. Wendy 
recognizes the irony in teaching children a speech 
pattern that she does not share, but her accent doesn’t 
undermine her effectiveness, she says. If anything, it 
makes the children’s final /r/ sounds, though system­
atically constructed, more their own.

“I say to them, ‘You’ll be better at this than I am,’” 
Wendy tells me after Samuel’s session wraps up. “And 
they are, by the time they finish.”


A week later, Samuel’s Wallingford Police Station 
tattoo, now seventeen days out, has peeled to only a 
grey penumbra of a crest. He practiced “Arrrarrrarrr” 
at home this week, and Wendy thinks he’s ready for 
full r-initial words. She pulls out a page scattered with 
terms: rope, road, read, ring, rag, rat, red, rip, rug, run.

Wendy has scrupulously sketched a picture beside 
each word to provide a visual cue. The hand-drawn 
illustrations strike me like Wendy’s micro-adjustment 
of the table, but this time, I trust that whatever ener­
gy and attention she put into them is necessary. That 
maybe, one day, they’ll be a part of why Samuel won’t 
have to dodge words with perilous r sounds or veto 
baby names of his own.

Samuel and Wendy take turns pointing to a picture 
and reciting the corresponding word. When Samu­
el’s lips begin to round, Wendy gently rests her palm 
against his lower lip. 

In a moment between drills, Samuel spots old pa­
pers protruding from Wendy’s case binder. “That’s 
from when you couldn’t say ‘church,’” Wendy says. 
Samuel clicks his tongue indignantly.

“I can say it!” he retorts. “Churrrrrrrrrrch.”
