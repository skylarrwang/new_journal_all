well,” Spell said. “But once the program started 
to take shape, we were never approached again.” 
Evan Serio, the director of Programming and 
Advocacy for the Sex Workers and Allies Network, 
or SWAN, said, “There was definitely a feeling 
in SWAN and several other groups that we had 
maybe been tokenized and brought in for the 
grant writing, because the city thought having a 
sex workers-led and focused group on the initial 
proposal looked really good.” 
“They took our help and didn’t give anything 
back or keep us in the process,” he added. 
In its grant application, the city promised to 
hire a LEAD Coordinator to run the program. 
The position’s primary responsibilities include 
outreach to community leaders and people who 
have experienced incarceration, homelessness, or 
drug abuse. The application promised that the city 
would fill the position within two months of the 
grant award, but by the summer of 2018 — nearly 
a year later — it had yet to hire anyone. Nor was 
there a LEAD website or even a whisper about the 
program on social media. 

And that wasn’t the only leadership void derail­
ing the program’s progress. In January 2018, just 
over a month after the program’s start date, Mar­
tha Okafor resigned as the head of the Community 
Services Administration, a city agency that coordi­
nates initiatives ranging from social services to the 
arts, and is responsible for LEAD planning efforts. 
In February, she was replaced by Dr. Dakibu 
Muley, for whom LEAD became just one of many 
new responsibilities. Spell, of Project Longevity, 
the gun violence reduction organization, told me 
he thought this vacuum in leadership caused the 
fledgling LEAD program to stall.
Indeed, throughout the early months of the 
pilot, community leaders’ efforts to glean infor­
mation about the program’s development were 
stonewalled at every turn. “We wanted to know 
how many people were being diverted and for 
what offenses, how frequently they accept it, and 
how often people feel like they know what they’re 
getting into,” said SWAN’s Serio. “[The city’s] ini­
tial response was that they couldn’t tell us because 
of HIPAA [Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act, the federal healthcare confi­
dentiality law] but it really felt like a smokescreen. 
They could very well just say that we don’t know 
and we’ll get back to you, and that would be okay 
— I understand that there are only so many hours 
a day. But it feels like they’re not even attempting 
to give us information.” In contrast, Albany pro­
gram managers proactively released a report that 
included descriptions of LEAD participants with 
identifying information redacted.
Serio told me that, despite the fact that SWAN 
does on-the-ground outreach in Fair Haven nearly 
every day and downtown at least once a week, they 
have yet to find anyone who is or was a participant 
in LEAD. To activists, this makes the city’s unre­
sponsiveness even more frustrating. 

Last June, a group of five community organiza­
tions, including SWAN, requested to meet with 
LEAD’s Operational Work Group to discuss the 
program’s lack of community involvement and 
transparency. Other than Muley, the new head of 
the Community Services Administration, only one 
member of the LEAD group came to the meeting. 
At the meeting, the activists pressed Muley to give 
them a say in hiring a new program coordinator. 
But Serio said he and the other community leaders 
were told they would just “bog the process down.” 
Though LEAD in New Haven operates out of a 
city government office, that’s not the case in most 
other LEAD cities. In Seattle, the program is run 
by the nonprofit Seattle Public Defender Associ­
ation, and in Albany it is managed by the Katal 
Center for Health, Equity, and Justice. Represen­
tatives from these organizations expressed skepti­
cism that a LEAD program run by a city govern­
ment could be effective. 

“In general, we recommend that the project is 
not managed out of a government office, so that 
community partners don’t feel like the whole 
enterprise is vulnerable to being folded into an 
elected official’s political agenda,” said Lisa Dau­
gaard, the head of the Seattle Public Defender 
Association.
Keith Brown, the Albany LEAD Project Man­
ager, echoed Daugaard’s concerns. Brown said 
that early LEAD programs like those in Seattle 
and Albany were “driven by folks who were on 
the ground, either civil rights groups, commu­
nity groups, or harm-reduction programs.” As the 
model spread around the country, however, Brown 
said LEAD became a buzzword, “one where 
money was often attached, so it then became a 
thing that municipalities and police departments 
decided to do.”

THE  NEW  JOURNAL
In August, the CSA finally hired Cynthia Wat­
son as the LEAD Project Manager, despite a lack 
of community input. Prior to joining LEAD, she 
worked as the Administrative Director of Christian 
Community Action, a New Haven-based social 
service organization. I interviewed Watson in a 
spare conference room in the annex wing of City 
Hall, where her office is located. In person, she’s 
affable and blunt. She told me that the program 
failed to achieve some of its core objectives in its 
first year. “There was a long lag where there was 
no communication with the community,” Watson 
admitted. She added that one of her main tasks 
as Project Director is to facilitate the formation 
of a Community Leadership Team made up of 
representatives from community groups and for­
merly incarcerated or homeless people. In Octo­
ber, Watson hosted a meeting with community 
groups that she called a “critical” opportunity for 
community members to voice their questions and 
concerns about the program and one of the first 
steps in the formation of a Community Leadership 
Team.
But SWAN’s Serio is less optimistic. He criti­
cized the city’s decision to only allow one delegate 
from the Community Leadership Team, once it 
is formed, to sit in on LEAD’s Operational Team 
meetings. In other cities like Albany, Serio said, 
the Community Leadership Teams formed in 
a more “organic” way, which forced the city to 
“cede them power and oversight and meet them 
halfway.” 

Watson has yet to make a website with infor­
mation about the program’s progress. In contrast, 
the Katal Center released a comprehensive report 
after the Albany program’s first year with detailed 
information including the program’s funding, 
stakeholders, and operational successes. 

The problems plaguing LEAD in New Haven 
go beyond institutional and organizational errors. 
LEAD is primarily a law enforcement program, so 
it only works if the police officers charged with 
implementing the model buy into it. 
During our ride-along, I asked Officer Garcia if 
he actively tries to divert people to LEAD. “The 
idea of [LEAD] is really good,” he said. “It’s just 
difficult with the amount of workload we have to 
follow up on.” Garcia added that he and his fel­
low officers seldom discuss the program, and that 
Hill district manager Lieutenant Jason Minardi 
had only brought up the program in front of him 
“once or twice.” Garcia admitted he’d never even 
considered offering someone LEAD diversion. 
When asked to comment on his role in LEAD, 
Minardi told me that he was on vacation and 
no longer doing interviews about the program. 
In response to a similar request, Sergeant Sean 
Maher, the Downtown District Manager, wrote 
that since he had only recently been assigned to 
Downtown, he wasn’t able to speak about his role 
in the program.
In other cities, LEAD administrators adopted 
proactive measures for encouraging police offi­
cers to make use of the program. In Albany, for 
example, LEAD administrators identified a core 
group of officers who supported the program’s 
approach to law enforcement and encouraged 
them to actively “spread the buy-in” across the 
department, Brown explained. Albany’s program 
also just recently started sending LEAD engage­
ment specialists — the program’s social workers — 
on ride-alongs with the police. In Seattle, the city 
held regular focus groups with officers in LEAD 
neighborhoods.
From the beginning, LEAD in New Haven 
lacked the structure of feedback and accountabil­
ity that has been integral to the model’s success 
in other cities. Six months from now, the original 
LEAD grant application money will run out. At 
that point, the city may attempt to extend the pro­
gram to more neighborhoods or even across the 
entire city. But a year into the pilot, basic ques­
tions about its efficacy don’t seem to have been 
answered.
Toward the end of my ride-along with Officer 
Garcia, he asked me to reach into his glove com­
partment and pull out a pile of paperwork. As I 
pulled out the pile, I saw, smushed into the back 
of the compartment, a small stack of LEAD pam­
phlets and xeroxed articles about the program 
from the Register and Independent. 
“Funny,” he said, and then chuckled. “I don’t 
even know how those got there.”
