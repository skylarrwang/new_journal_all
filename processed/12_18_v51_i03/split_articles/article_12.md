wo years into Donald Trump’s presidency, Amer­
icans are riled up. In the 2018 midterms, on Novem­
ber 6, an estimated 113 million of them flocked to the polls, 
marking the highest turnout rate in a midterm election since 
1966. That energy spread to New Haven, where turnout spiked 
by more than 7,500 votes from 2014 to 2018; 34,392 people, 
nearly 59 percent of those registered in the city, cast their bal­
lots. Some voters showed up out of concern for the state of the 
nation: people like Ananya Kumar-Banerjee, who led a group 
of Yale Democrats across the Green to register at City Hall at 
9 a.m. and said that on Election Day, she always wakes up 
in the morning without feeling tired. Others sought to weigh 
in on the tight gubernatorial race between Ned Lamont and 
Bob Stefanowski: people like Mark Cappabianca, a lifelong 
New Haven resident who is 57 and voted for the first time 
because he worries about cuts to services for people like him 
who are homeless or in recovery. The day was full of mishaps in 
the Elm City, from malfunctioning voting machines to under­
staffed polling places, and New Haven was the last of the 
state’s 169 municipalities to gets its votes tallied, sending in a 
final count three weeks after the election. But by Wednesday, 
November 7, the state results were clear. Connecticut Dem­
ocrats had prevailed in the House and Senate, and Lamont 
beat Stefanowski by 40,000 votes.

On voting day, TNJ reporters fanned out across New Haven 
to capture scenes from the election. In this series of dispatches 
from around the city, we hope to capture the energy that set 
the city’s forty polling places abuzz.

Ward 22 Alder Jeanette Morrison, who represents the 
Dixwell neighborhood, stood outside the entrance of the 
Wexler-Grant School in a sweatshirt and yoga pants at 8 in 
the morning, beaming. Morrison had been there for an hour 
and a half, she said, “educating people about the ballot.” She 
began to hold forth on the importance of voting, interrupting 
herself to hug each individual who entered as elderly neigh­
borhood residents and a smattering of Yale students trickled 
in from across the schoolyard. “Has your Jordan graduated 
high school yet? Still working 1,000 jobs? Well, tell him to 
get a move on!” Then, to me: “Sorry about that. Where was 
I? Oh. I vote because we need more money for neighborhood 
initiatives. More money for schools. When teachers are cut, 
children suffer—emotionally, too.” She paused again and 
dashed across the street to investigate after a neighbor told 
her the school didn’t know how to deal with a recent garbage 
overflow.

A few minutes later, she returned. “Connecticut has a 
good partnership,” she resumed, “between city and state. As 
Betty Morrison, my mother, would say, ‘They don’t take no 
tea for fever.’” I asked her if she felt the same way about the 
president. She laughed. “Oh, no. My mother said something 
else, too: ‘If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say it!’”

Abruptly, she turned back to business: a man in a leather 
jacket had somehow slipped past her hug. “Honey, do you 
know there are two sides to that piece of paper?” she asked, 
referring to the ballot. He didn’t. “Can you go back home 
and get everyone to come, and tell them there are two sides?” 
The man left. Half an hour later, he came back with a crowd.

Outside the glass-paneled wooden doors of the Hear­
ing Room in the basement of the New Haven Hall of 
Records, Patrick Mitchell sat sentry halfway down a 
maroon-carpeted hallway, his legs and torso folded 
into a desk that was far too small for him. Mitchell, 
who is broad-shouldered, with closely-trimmed hair, 
wore squarish, thick-framed black glasses, a blazer and 
striped button down, and white-soled tennis shoes. 
Inside the Hearing Room, Ward 7 voters snaked their 
way through the line, about fifty strong, and cast their 
ballots. As they headed back out into the cold, misty 
morning, Mitchell flagged them down, proffering a 
white slip of paper.

Mitchell, an insurance agent who lives in Fair Haven 
Heights, has conducted exit polls for Edison Research 
in each of the past three Congressional elections. 
Media outlets have relied on exit polls to bolster their 
election coverage since the ‘70s, and Edison has con­
ducted polling for the National Election Pool, a group 
of major news outlets including ABC, CBS, CNN, 
NBC, Fox News, and the Associated Press, since 2003. 
The practice may be fading; after exit polls erroneously

  AT THE POLLS
pointed towards a Hillary Clinton victory in the 2016 
Presidential Election, Fox and the AP dropped out of 
the Pool. But Mitchell sat dutifully, offering a sheet to 
every third voter who passed. Once they filled it out, 
confirming their ballot selections and filling out basic 
demographic information, Mitchell deposited the 
sheet into a small white box on the floor to his left.

Since he became eligible to vote in 1980, Mitch­
ell hasn’t missed an election. He describes voting as 
a “family tradition.” He hails from Montgomery, and 
his parents worked with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr. to register voters during the Civil Rights Move­
ment, once encountering Klansmen in rural Alabama 
on a registration drive. Later, they followed the Great 
Migration north to Connecticut. Now in their eight­
ies, they live in Georgia, where they voted for Stacey 
Abrams, who was running to be the first Black woman 
elected to a governorship. Mitchell has five children, 
four of whom are old enough to vote. On Tuesday, he’d 
called them all and told them to get to the polls.

At midday, the lobby of Wilbur Cross High 
School teemed with rain-coated residents of Wards 
9 and 10, which include the East Rock neighbor­
hood, Cedar Hill, and Fair Haven. They’d come 
to cast their ballots, waiting in line beneath SAT 
prep posters and Warhol-inspired student portraits. 
Outside, the basalt face of East Rock loomed over 
the parking lot, where supporters of Ned Lamont 
had set up a tent. (Bob Stefanowski’s campaign was 
nowhere in sight.)

Standing on the damp sidewalk after voting, 
East Rock resident Deniqua Brunson said she was 
“thinking about the younger children” this Elec­
tion Day. The statement made her sound older 
than she looked, dressed in black Air Jordans and a 
gold-speckled black cap emblazoned with the word 
“Hustle” in red lettering. Brunson’s in her late twen­
ties, but she’s never been apathetic towards politics. 
In terms of political engagement, she said, “I’m like 
a ten.”

Outside her job as a surgical tech at Yale New 
Haven Hospital, she helps underprivileged kids at 
Connecticut Behavioral Health. Some of the kids 
she works with have run away from home. Others 
can scarcely go to school because they lash out at 
other students. Brunson thinks the root cause is 
often a home life made turbulent by unemploy­
ment. She wants more jobs for young people, and 
when Lamont visited the hospital to campaign ear­
lier this year, she told him so. He seemed to listen, 
so he got her vote.

The current administration also worries Brunson. 
She doesn’t like the tone Donald Trump has set 
as President. “You can’t lead the country based on 
emotion,” she said. “Twitter should be taken away 
from him.”

As the workday drew to an end and the sky continued 
to emit a light drizzle, Fair Haven residents trickled 
steadily through the front entrance of John S. Martinez 
School, a low-slung building with undulating brown 
walls. Volunteers for the New Haven Democratic 
Town Committee handed out sky blue voting guides in 
Spanish and English to those parking their cars. (Fair 
Haven’s population is 67 percent Latinx, according to 
2016 numbers.) They cheered as Ward 16 residents 
entered and left. Inside, pensive voters mulled over 
their decisions in the glow of a row of booths.

Standing under the awning just outside the front 
doors, Ebony McClease and Vincenzo Ferraro, 
two strangers donning matching “I Voted!” stickers, 
attempted to find middle ground on issues ranging 
from taxation and healthcare to gun reform and immi­
gration policy.

“If it’s hatred, it’s hatred. I don’t care how you slice 
it,” McClease said. “Right now, there’s a lot of senti­
ment and language that is scary. Everybody needs to 
take a step back sometimes. What if you were in some­
one else’s shoes?”
