EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Six to eight weeks before the 
deadline, Chair of the 
Reinstatement Committee,  
Dean Risa Sodi, emails 
withdrawn students 
application information.
Students on 
medical with­
drawal must 
be cleared to 
return by a 
doctor at Yale 
Health.
Students must 
have enrolled 
in two courses 
at a four-year 
accredited insti­
tution and earn 
grades of B or 
higher in both.
To reapply, students submit 
a personal statement and 
two letters supporting their 
application, mailed to Sodi’s 
address. In their application, 
students must describe what 
their alternative plans are if 
they are not reinstated.
Students 
must have no 
outstanding 
balance owed 
to Yale.
Upon submitting appropriate 
materials, students must 
schedule an interview with 
Sodi. Students withdrawn for 
mental health reasons must 
schedule an interview with Di­
rector of Yale Mental Health & 
Counseling Lorraine Siggins.
The Reinstatement Commit­
tee—Sodi, Siggins, and Dean 
of Academic Affairs Mark 
Schenker—reviews applica­
tions and renders decisions 
about whether students are 
ready to come back. 
Four to five weeks before the 
term begins, they notify 
students of their status via 
email.
Students may need to make 
housing or academic accomo­
dations with the Resource 
Office on Disabilities.
Students must communi­
cate with their Residential 
College Dean about their 
return.
The committee no­

The three-person committee—Sodi, Dean of Academic Affairs Mark 
Schenker, and Director of Yale Mental Health & Counsel­
ing Dr. Lorraine Siggins—reviews the application, makes 
a decision, and notifies the student about whether she will 
be reinstated.
Two of the students interviewed said that they were grate­
ful that they were forced to take time away or not allowed 
to come back after a first application for reinstatement. But 
several students, including those two, said that the process 
was anxiety-inducing and stressful, or that it even impeded 
their efforts to prepare for reenrollment. One student cur­
rently withdrawn for bipolar disorder who asked to remain 
anonymous because she has not yet been reinstated said 
she thought her application was denied because of two 
instances when she checked herself into a psychiatric ward 
for a night, months before she applied. “They saw it as a 
sign that I needed more time away,” she told me. “I was 
worried they would penalize me because I reached out for 
help.”
On the day she died, Wang posted a status on Facebook. 
In it, she described her intense worry of “having to leave 
for a full year, or of leaving and never being readmitted” 
to Yale. According to the YCPS, “A student is eligible to be 
reinstated only once; a second reinstatement may be con­
sidered only under unusual circumstances, ordinarily of a 
medical nature.”


Brown, the student who withdrew after struggling to 
complete her first-year writing requirement, comes from a 
low-income family; a scholarship from the Gates Millen­
nium Foundation covers all of her attendance costs. After 
learning she needed to leave Yale, she knew she could 
not afford a plane ticket home. Her Head of College, Ste­
ven Pitti, covered the cost of the flight to Albuquerque. 
“I’m pretty sure it was out of his own pocket,” she said. 
“I remember telling him, ‘I’ll pay you back,’ and he said, 
‘When you’re famous and you’ve graduated from Yale.’” 
In the hours following the meeting, Brown moved 
everything she couldn’t fit into her luggage to the Native 
American Cultural Center’s basement. She logged nine­
teen hours of work there, mostly spent cooking for the cen­
ter’s Welcome Back Barbecue, to have money when she 
returned to New Mexico.
Brown flew home just days after the barbecue. In a letter 


sent to Holloway the next week, her college advisor and 
architecture professor Karla Britton criticized the adminis­
tration for failing to provide Brown any option other than 
returning home. Instead, Britton suggested the school offer 
students like Brown an internship or job in New Haven. “In 
my 14 years of teaching at Yale College, I have not encoun­
tered another student with such a deliberate determination 
to give back to her community of origin,” Britton wrote. “If 
Charelle could have been given broader support for her 
goals at Yale, she could have been positioned to influence 
not only her pueblo, but certainly the students and faculty 
at the Yale School of Architecture as well.”
During her year at home in New Mexico, Brown lived 
with her brother, his wife, and their children. “When 
I got home, my family did not want to talk about why I 
had to leave. They were embarrassed that I came home,” 
Brown said. She biked everywhere to cut travel costs. And 
she worked to get over her fears of writing. “I spent the 
year writing all the time, writing every single day, writing 
in [my] journal,” she said. “That’s really what helped me 
figure things out.”
In the spring, to fulfill the two-course requirement for 
reinstatement, she enrolled part-time at the University of 
New Mexico, commuting daily by train and bus, three 
hours round trip. UNM offers financial aid to full-time stu­
dents only; to pay for her classes, she worked at the school’s 
Indigenous Design + Planning Institute, which gave her a 
tuition grant in place of a salary. She had no income, so 
to pay for transportation and food, every Friday and many 
Wednesdays, she cooked and sold burritos to other commu­
nity members in her pueblo.
When Brown began her application for reinstatement in 
May, she quickly encountered barriers. There was an out­
standing balance of $1,551.85 on her account, which she 
could not afford to pay. Of this amount, $504.32 was listed 
as “Board” charges from the fifteen days she had spent 
at Yale eight months earlier, and $165.44 was “Room” 
charges. Her scholarship is only valid for full semesters, so 
it did not cover the two weeks she had lived at Yale. Yale 
had placed Brown’s account on financial hold, preventing 
her from applying for reinstatement to Yale or requesting 
transcripts, which Brown needed to present before receiv­
ing her scholarship. She wrote a letter to her tribal governor 
explaining her dilemma and requesting that her tribe cover 
the outstanding balance. Tribal officials quickly agreed, 
and the payment was processed on May 31.
Brown was reinstated on August 3, 2017. Upon her 
return, she hoped to live with her friends and former 
suitemates, but she was placed with two transfer students 
instead. This year, she moved out of Ezra Stiles. “I just 
didn’t feel connected to it,” she said.


In fall 2014, Holloway, the former Dean, appointed a 
committee of six, chaired by English professor John Rogers, 
to review practices surrounding withdrawal and readmis­
sion. The committee was the administration’s first public 
effort to address policies and processes that had been criti­
cized for more than fifteen years, according to a story pub­
lished in the Yale Daily News in 2015. The semester prior, 
a Yale College Council task force had published a six-page 
report recommending changes to the process. Sitting on 
the administration’s committee were Mark Schenker, the 
Dean of Academic Affairs, former Trumbull Dean Jas­
mina Besirevic-Regan, and two lawyers from Yale’s Office 
of General Counsel: Susan Sawyer and Caroline Hendel. 
Sara Samuel, then a senior, was the only student.
The administration’s committee met eleven times and 
interviewed the registrar, the Director of Financial Aid, the 
Readmission Committee, residential college deans, repre­
sentatives from the YCC, and students who had withdrawn 
and been “readmitted,” as the process was then called. “We 
spent a lot of time discussing the requirements for getting 
back,” Samuel told me. “We wanted to present the policies 
in a transparent fashion.”
Wang committed suicide that January, part-way through 
the review process. Samuel, the only member who agreed 
to comment about the committee’s proceedings, said its 
members found the event sobering. “It really added to the 


The committee issued a 4,300-word report in April 
2015, outlining suggestions for policy and implementation. 
Some were simple: a change from “readmission” to “rein­
statement” to dispel a sentiment that withdrawal nullified 
a student’s Yale acceptance, an extension of the period 
for taking leaves of absence from ten to fifteen days, and 
the elimination of a $50 reinstatement fee. According to 
Sodi, Holloway endorsed all of the 2015 recommendations, 
meaning they could be enacted as policy. Many of the 
changes were made immediately. However, as of Novem­
ber 2018, three and a half years after the report was issued, 
several other recommendations endorsed by Holloway, 
who left Yale in 2017, are outstanding or only partially 
implemented.
The major recommendation that remains unfulfilled is 
the creation of a website to guide students and their fam­
ilies through the withdrawal and reinstatement processes. 
The report recommended that the website include down­
loadable application materials, information about the 
72-hour rule and insight into the financial aspects of with­
drawal, including an explanation of tuition insurance. As 
of December 3, no such website existed. A “Reinstatement 
FAQ” page created earlier in 2018 contains no information 
except a label that it is ‘under construction’ and a link back 
to the legalese of the YCPS. In a November 6 email, Sodi 
said the FAQs would be put into effect that month, and on 
November 27, she wrote that they were nearly ready for 
publication. Back in February 2016, Holloway told the Yale 
Daily News that the website would be up by spring break 
of that year.
The University’s implementation of other recommenda­
tions has been uneven. Several suggestions made by the 
committee do not appear in the YCPS; it is unclear whether 
they are not policy or just unavailable for students to view. 
For example, the report recommends that students on per­
sonal, medical, or academic withdrawal be able to petition 
for online library access. It also suggests that administra­
tors require students to meet with their residential college 
deans while applying for reinstatement. (Neither policy 
exists in the YCPS.) The report also recommends moving 
the fall reinstatement application deadline to June 1. (Cur­
rent policy has a fall deadline on July 1.)
In some cases, the University has neglected to formalize 
its policies in writing or communicate them to administra­
tors. For instance, after finding that some students’ ID cards
