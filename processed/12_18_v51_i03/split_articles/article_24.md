and email accounts were being deactivated immediately 
after withdrawal, while others’ accounts were left active 
for months, the committee recommended that Yale sus­
pend student email accounts fourteen days after withdraw­
ing. However, this fall, Sodi said students now have email 
access for three years after withdrawal. (YCPS contains no 
mention of this policy.) When Springer withdrew after her 
concussion, her dean, Christine Muller, told her that her 
email would be deactivated. Quickly, Springer sent emails 
to alumni, with whom she was working to coordinate a con­
ference taking place that spring, passing on other students’ 
contact information—even though she was banned from 
viewing screens because of her concussion. Her email was 
never suspended.


When Springer returned to her home in Shoreview, 
Minnesota, last December, she was under doctor’s orders 
to do as little as possible. She continued physical and occu­
pational therapy for her eyesight, which was badly damaged 
and causing her headaches. She couldn’t read books for 
weeks. “I did a lot of sitting on my front porch,” she told 
me. “I couldn’t exercise or move quickly without passing 
out.”

By the end of February, three months after she was 
struck by the disco ball, her condition was improving. She 
traveled to California and Canada to visit friends and fam­
ily. She started reading books again. At that point, she knew 
little about the reinstatement process. When she withdrew, 
she got the impression from Muller, former Dean of Say­
brook College, that her reinstatement would be guaran­
teed. “Dean Muller just really emphasized, ‘Don’t even 
worry about it. You’ll have to do an application, but don’t 
worry about that until April,’” Springer said. “It was very 
much presented to me as a non-issue. Both my mom and I 
were under the impression that there was no question of my 
coming back.” But she was later told multiple times in the 
standardized emails she received from the Reinstatement 
Committee that reinstatement was not assured.

Because her withdrawal was related to physical health, 
Springer was required to pay for a flight to New Haven in 
April to be cleared to return by Yao-wen Hu, Director of 
Athletic Medicine at Yale Health. “He was like, ‘Do you 
feel good?” Springer told me. “I was like, ‘yes.’ It was a 
twenty-minute meeting. I was like ‘Wow, I really came out 
here for this?’” She returned to Minnesota after the meet­
ing. By late May, she had mailed in a personal statement 
explaining why she wanted to be reinstated and two letters 
supporting her return from an instructor and an employer.

On May 31, Springer received an email from Sodi’s assis­
tant, Rolaina Wright, telling her to set up interviews with 
both Sodi and Director of Yale Mental Health & Counsel­
ing Lorraine Siggins. The subject line was “reinstatement 
materials received.” Springer scheduled both interviews for 
the last two weeks of June.

Then, on June 18, she received another email from 
Wright. The subject was “reinstatement materials NOT 
received.” Sodi had never received Springer’s medical 
clearance letter from Yale’s doctor. “I suggest, then, that 
you contact Dr. Hu to request a duplicate,” Sodi wrote later 
that day in an email to Springer, who frantically called Yale 
Student Health and Yale Medical Records to reauthorize 
them to send her health files to Sodi.

That day, Springer had rearranged her schedule for a 
Skype interview with Siggins about her mental health. At 
the time, she was enrolled in two courses at the University 
of Minnesota—a calculus class and an introductory eco­
nomics class—to fulfill the two-credit requirement for rein­
statement. The conversation with Siggins was quick. “She 
was like, ‘Oh, Jesica, I just opened your file because I was 
going to interview you, but I see that you withdrew because 
of a concussion. So I guess we don’t really need to talk,’” 
Springer told me. They ended the Skype call. “They just 
assumed without ever looking at my case that I had men­
tal health issues,” Springer said. Siggins did not respond to 
multiple requests for comment.

When Brown applied for reinstatement, she, too, was told 
by an administrative assistant, Lisa Miller, that she needed 
to interview with Siggins, even though she explicitly men­
tioned she withdrew for academic reasons when schedul­
ing the interview. Unlike Springer, Brown completed the 
interview with Siggins. No Yale policy requires students on 
academic withdrawal to interview with a psychiatrist.


On October 22, Sodi met with Yale College Council 
Vice President Heidi Dong and Director for Student Life 
Grace Kang to discuss a new set of policy recommenda­
tions for withdrawal and reinstatement that the YCC had 
been working on since the spring. (Kang is also a formerly 
withdrawn student; she hurt her back during her first 
semester, spent a year away, and was reinstated in the fall 
of 2017.) Earlier in October, the council had conducted a 
focus group with four reinstated students, soliciting feed­
back about the withdrawal and reinstatement processes.

The YCC proposed eliminating a requirement for stu­
dents withdrawn for academic and personal reasons to 
spend two full semesters away from Yale. The suggestions 
also included offering financial aid for students who, like 
Brown, cannot afford to take required classes while away 
from campus, creating an earlier application cycle for with­
drawn international students to give those who are rein­
stated more time to apply for visas, and establishing a Peer 
Liaison program for recently reinstated students.


Many of the suggestions YCC brought to the adminis­
tration in 2014 have yet to be implemented. “The Dean’s 
office thinks that they’re welcoming to returning students 
and helpful to students looking to get reinstated, but some­
where along this chain of people, reinstated students feel 
neglected by the Dean’s office,” Kang wrote in an email. 
But Dong and Kang both said that Sodi, who has been the 
chair of the Reinstatement Committee since October 2017, 
was receptive of the latest set of proposals. “Because she’s 
new, she wasn’t aware of some of the problems that students 
had,” Kang wrote. According to Kang, Sodi will pose YCC’s 
recommendations to other deans in a December meeting. 
However, Kang added that it may take up to two years for 
the changes to be implemented.

In the YCC’s research into other schools’ policies, 
Brown University stood out. Its reinstatement process is 
fairly simple. If a student leaves for medical reasons and 
wants to return, they need to do three things: write a letter 
explaining their case to the student support dean they are 
paired with while away, procure and supply a letter from a 
treatment provider, and fill out an information release form 
to allow deans to access their medical information. Brown 
does not require students on medical leave to take classes 
while away, or to interview with any Brown officials.

Brown’s Office of Student Support Services website con­
tains a wealth of information about the school’s protocols 
for leaving and returning. Online guidelines include a 
four-week timeline of the petition review process, an out­
line of the criteria the committee use to evaluate cases, and 
a list of committee members. If a student wants to appeal 
the committee’s choice, the guidelines also provide instruc­
tions on how to do so. Prior to the creation of the guidelines 
in 2017, Brown deans ran a comprehensive blog about the 
medical leave process, complete with student and parent 
testimonials.

Daisha Roberts, a YCC senator who has contributed to 
the group’s research, praised Brown’s policies. “Everything 
is just student-centered, and they really care about the stu­
dent’s well-being more than our policy does,” she said.


On July 16, Springer learned the committee had rein­
stated her, even before grades from her summer courses 
at the University of Minnesota were released. Students 
need a B or higher in their required two classes to be rein­
stated. She was relieved to hear the news—and knew she 
would pass the classes—but was still confused. “Why did 
[the committee] make me pay for these classes if [they] are 
going to reinstate me without seeing proof of them?” she 
asked.

Springer said that returning to Yale as a first-year for the 
second time is different. She has different priorities; she 
worries about different pressures. Her second set of orienta­
tion meetings was useless. She’s retaking the same French 
class she nearly completed last year. She’s managing a 4.5 
credit course load, prioritizing paper-heavy courses over 
detail-oriented ones. “My memory is not as good as it used 
to be,” she said. “My short-term memory is just not there. 
I’m having a really hard time keeping track of people.” A 
few times, she has mistakenly reintroduced herself to some­
one she met last year.

Since her concussion, Springer has worn bifocals to 
help her eyes shift between looking at close-up and far-
away objects; her eyes no longer converge and she has 
minimal vision between one and three feet from her face. 
Her adjustment was also marred by bureaucratic chal­
lenges. She could not be guaranteed housing with her class 
because she was not reinstated until after dorm arrange­
ments were set. Even though Springer was assigned a room 
in Vanderbilt Hall with other first-years in Saybrook at the 
last-minute, after a student decided not to matriculate, she 
was not granted the medical single she requested for her 
post-concussion sleep disturbances. The summer credits 
she took did not transfer automatically; she spent weeks 
convincing the Math and Economics departments to trans­
fer them, seeking advice and support from Sodi.

Springer told me she found that Yale’s policy and process 
created barriers that exacerbated the challenges she faced 
in returning to school. “It could be so much more person­
alized,” she said. “The person who I had rearranged my 
entire schedule to have a Skype interview with thought that 
I withdrew for mental health reasons. It’s kind of absurd 
to me that I’m put through the same process as someone 
who’s on a disciplinary leave. I also think that requiring two 
classes when I was gone for a semester—and that I would 
just have to pay for these things—is just absurd.”

When Springer arrived for move-in this year, there was 
no ID or key for her, although she had been communi­
cating with university staff including Cissy Armstrong, the 
Assistant to the Dean in Saybrook, for more than a month 
about her impending return.

After arriving to Old Campus with her luggage, Springer 
walked over to a woman from the registrar’s office stand­
ing nearby. “I was like ‘I’m a reinstated student, there’s no 
ID here under my name, I don’t have a key to my room,’” 
Springer said. “And this lady was like, ‘Are you sure you’re 
reinstated? Are you sure? Have you gotten a letter? Are you 
sure you’re actually reinstated, and don’t just think you are? 
Are you sure you’re a student here?’ I was almost crying 
when Cissy walked up and was like, ‘She’s good!’”

Three days later, Springer found out the woman from 
the registrar’s office was her first-year advisor.
