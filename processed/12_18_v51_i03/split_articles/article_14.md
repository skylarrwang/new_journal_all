**Election Day in New Haven**

At 7 p.m., the line to register to vote at City Hall 
snaked all the way around the building’s second floor. 
Yale students in line had surrendered to the floor, open 
textbooks on their laps. Volunteers from the League of 
Women Voters and Yale Law School circulated with reg­
istration forms, boxes of Wall Street Pizza, and plastic 
cups of water. “It’s not a dinner party, it’s not rude if you 
take it,” said one, offering the final donut in a Dunkin’ 
carton to a young woman filling out her form. The food 
went fast: some in line had been waiting nearly four 
hours.

For the third year in a row, New Haven was unpre­
pared for the legion of unregistered voters who turned 
up at City Hall on Election Day. Many were Yale stu­
dents like Jack Frésquez, a sophomore in Hopper Col­
lege, who had hoped to vote in a contentious Senate 
race at home in Arizona. When he realized that his 
absentee ballot wouldn’t arrive in time, he was grateful 
to find out that Connecticut is one of just fifteen states 
that offer same-day registration. But Frésquez had been 
in line since 3:30. With just an hour to go before the 
deadline, it seemed impossible that the city could pro­
cess the hundreds of people still waiting to register.

Volunteers and city officials went into battle mode. 
Law students directed those in line to take photos of 
their registration forms and email them to a student who 
would catalogue them. Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, 
a Democrat up for reelection, strode through the crowd 
in high-heeled boots and a long, striped dress, firing 
questions at officials from the Secretary of the State’s 
office over the phone. A few minutes later, speaking into 
a bullhorn, John Rose, Jr., chief counsel for the city, 
called all first-time Connecticut voters into the lobby. 
Around fifty people shuffled in. A woman with four 
small children in tow waited quietly for directions. With 
just fifteen minutes left, the announcement came: the 
higher-ups had given New Haven officials permission to 
swear these voters in and send them to the ballot boxes 
with filled-out registration forms. There was a sigh of 
relief, and the masses made their way to the voting line.

When the clock struck 8, that line still stretched all 
the way down the hall –– but its members would get 
to vote. Less fortunate were hopeful registrants who 
weren’t new to Connecticut; in the registration room, 
election moderator Kevin Arnold apologized and turned 
them away.

At 8:15, Mayor Toni Harp stood by the registration 
computers in tennis shoes and a black suit. She greeted 
me with a tired smile. She said she was glad that the 
chief counsel had found a way to make sure first-time 
voters could cast their ballots. “We’ve learned a lot from 
how many people came, and perhaps how to do a better 
job next time,” she said.

At the tables in front of her, the half-dozen women 
who had spent the day registering hundreds of people 
were finally getting to their feet. Cynthia Woods had 
been there since 5 a.m. “My eyes are burning,” she said, 
laughing. But she hadn’t lost the gentle tone she’d been 
using all day. She worked Election Day last year, too, 
she said, and she’d do it again.

“You know, the body is physically tired, but I’m just 
on such a high, seeing the process come through, seeing 
folks get excited about wanting to vote.” She smiled. “I 
think it’s really exciting.”
