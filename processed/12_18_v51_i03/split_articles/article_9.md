O
ne evening in late September, I walked 
into the Aldermanic Hearing Room on the 
lower level of the New Haven Hall of Records. 
The room’s walls were lined with maps, planners, 
and varnished wood trim. Michael Harris leaned 
against a table as he chatted with the people gath­
ered at the front of the room. When all twenty-six 
students had arrived, Harris pointed to a city map 
and requested that we each find our ward. Then, 
he thanked us for coming, and class began.


Harris was leading a session of Democracy 
School, an initiative founded by then-New 
Haven mayoral assistant Kate McAdams in 2002 
to provide New Haven residents an opportunity 
to learn about the workings of city government. 
The free, eight-week, application-based course 
hosts just over two dozen New Haven residents 
each fall. Each class session focuses on a specific 
city department, and Harris, who has run the pro­
gram since 2015, invites relevant officials and city 
residents to discuss their work. Harris also serves 
as Special Assistant to Mayor Toni Harp, and 
was consequently well-positioned to explain the 
basics of governance and city funding and lead 
discussions on emergency services, New Haven’s 
education system, and city neighborhoods. A red-haired man with clear eyes and a perpetual grin, 
he is an enthusiastic teacher. “Did you know that 
New Haven has thirty alders?” he asked during 
an informational presentation at the Tsai Center 
for Innovative Thinking in May. “That’s crazy. 
Almost no city in this country has close to that 
many elected officials representing the interests 
of their constituents.” Inspired by that presenta­
tion, I applied for the 2018 session and in the fall, 
I joined Democracy School’s sixteenth class.


This fall’s course underscored the challenges, 
big and small, that drive the work of city officials. 
During one lesson, Doug Housladen, the Direc­
tor of New Haven’s Transportation, Traffic, and 
Parking Department, told students that only 27 
percent of jobs in the Greater New Haven area 
are within a one-way 90-minute commute from 
New Haven on public transit. Much of the prob­
lem, he explained, is in the city’s excess of bus 
stops: 4,000 in a region with an estimated need 
for only 2,500. As busses make unnecessary stops, 
commutes drag on and on.


The classroom also provides a space for resi­
dents to discuss the tensions of life in a highly 
segregated, budget-strapped city. One student, a 
woman in her forties who works with substance 
abuse rehabilitation services in New Haven, 
asked Maurine Villani, a tax collector who pre­
sented during one class this fall, about the city’s 
contracted tow-truck companies. “I’ve lived in 
New Haven all of my life, and in many different 
types of neighborhoods in the city,” she said. “It 
seems like your vendors disregard tax-delinquent 
vehicles around Yale—and I know that they’re 
tax delinquent—yet tow lots of the vehicles, even 
non-tax-delinquent ones, in neighborhoods that 
are far from Yale. They took my car once, and 
it wasn’t tax delinquent,” she said. Villani didn’t 
quite know what to say.


Nearly every class discussion of the Board of 
Alders or the city budget this fall circled back to 
the frustrating nature of “functional home rule.” 
In the context of New Haven, functional home 
rule means that the city has limited autonomy 
over its legislative processes because municipal 
rules are largely defined by the state. For exam­
ple, the Connecticut Constitution limits cities’ 
tax revenue-raising power to property taxes––an 
issue Harris and four city officials raised during 
the second class. This limit on taxes presents a 
challenge for New Haven, where 54 percent of 
local property is designated tax-exempt. Yale Uni­
versity alone represents about 2.5 billion dollars 
of non-taxable property assets; the growth of its 
property holdings continues to reduce the city’s 
potential revenue. And despite the city’s obvious 
fiscal challenges, the state continues to allocate 
fewer and fewer state funds to New Haven. The 
city’s public education system has particularly 
struggled. Its schools, which serve the largest stu­
dent population of any district in the state, faced 
a $19 million budget deficit this spring, forcing 
firings and school closures. In class, Harris and 
New Haven Controller Daryl Jones explained 
that last year, the city was forced to make these 
cuts because state and property tax revenue had 
shrunk so much.


This year’s Democracy School attendees 
ranged from high school students to an Escape 
New Haven employee to a retiree who had 
worked at a New Haven telephone company for 
decades. Some had just moved to the city, while 
others had lived in New Haven their entire lives. 
Still, the student body represented only twelve of 
the thirty wards; most students hailed from wards 
closer to downtown. To address this issue, Harris 
said he hopes to create an online curriculum that 
makes the course readily accessible.


Democracy School’s alumni include many 
young and active community members. Caro­
line Smith, who graduated from Yale in 2014, 
said the course taught her that “the foundation 
of any good project is relationship-building.” 
She now coordinates New Haven Bike Month, 
participates on several city committees, and 
co-founded Collab, which helps local residents 
pursue entrepreneurship. Democracy School 
helped her form connections to local officials and 
students, facilitating her community-based work, 
she said. Johnny Shively, a 2015 Yale graduate, 
works for SeeClickFix, an app that allows users 
to report non-emergency issues, such as problems 
with infrastructure. He told me that learning the 
terminology of city governance has helped him 
engage with New Haven politics. John Martin, 
the founder of the popular Bradley Street Bicycle 
Co-Op, said that he tries to informally foster the 
program’s values—connectivity and agency—at 
the Co-Op. The course, he said, gave him the 
confidence and agency to serve as a community 
leader. In the face of massive economic chal­
lenges, former students are waging efforts to cre­
ate economic opportunity, to help the city run, 
to bring people together. If New Haven is “a city 
that is fighting for itself,” as Caroline Smith put it, 
Democracy School is evidence of the city’s hopes 
for victory—and the stalemates its residents face.
