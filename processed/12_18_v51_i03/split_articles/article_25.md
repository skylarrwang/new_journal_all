**Title: I Was a Featured Speaker at Gilmore Girls Fan Fest 2018**

I 
found out about Gilmore Girls Fan Fest while 
serving, in August, on Appalachian Trail Sup­
port Crew for FOOT, a pre-orientation backpacking 
program for first-years at Yale. We –– the four people 
charged with handling emergencies in the backcoun­
try –– were stationed in Kent, Connecticut, and it was 
while perusing Yelp on a desperate quest for a bagel that 
I discovered that the town hosts a gathering for Gilm­
ore Girls fans in October. I didn’t know much about 
the show at the time, but I’d seen enough episodes to 
gather that it was a heartwarming mother-daughter sit­
com set in a fictional Connecticut small town. Kent, 
with its artisanal cheese shop and hockey-powerhouse 
boarding school, seemed like the perfect place for fans. 
I imagined being back in Kent in autumn, surrounded 
by women who love Melissa McCarthy, and I realized 
: I needed to go. Gilmore Girls Fan Fest was going to 
be like the magical feminist utopia island from Won­
der Woman, if Wonder Woman were written by Martha 
Stewart.

After snagging The New Journal’s approval, I sent 
an email to the coordinators of GGFF asking for a 
press pass. This is where things got complicated: I was 
granted the pass (huge–– tickets to the festival were 
about $250), but I was also asked if I could lead a panel 
on “writing for the news.”

If you aren’t familiar with Gilmore Girls, you may 
wonder, “Now, why would they want you, of all people, 
to do that?” Good question. Rory Gilmore, one of the 
show’s two protagonists, goes to Yale with journalistic 
ambitions and eventually becomes Eeditor-in-Cchief of 
the Yale Daily News. When I confessed to the festival’s 
director that I not only did not write for the News, but 
had never written a story for any Yale publication at all, 
she told me not to worry and to lead the panel anyway. 
She did request that, if possible, I bring a friend from 
the YDN.

I found the ideal man for the job in the form of 
Eamonn Smith, a good friend and novice reporter 
for the News. Eamonn knew even less about Gilmore 
Girls than I did, which I thought might make me seem 
like the more authoritative panelist. When Eamonn 
and I showed up at the Festival’s administrative offices 
early Friday morning, I realized for the first time what, 
exactly, I had gotten myself into. One of the first inter­
actions we had was with a volunteer, who, upon learn­
ing we were press from Yale, exclaimed, “Look! It’s 
Rory and Logan!” (Logan is Rory’s Yale boyfriend to 
whom Eamonn bears a passing resemblance. Eamonn: 
“Who’s Logan?”) I was delighted at being compared to 
the inarguably hot Alexis Bledel, who plays Rory, but I 
also realized in that moment that I had agreed to spend 
two-and-a-half days in a small town overrun by fanatical 
devotees of a show I’d barely watched. A massive tent 
served as the festival’s epicenter, but events were held 
throughout Kent’s quaint downtown. In the restaurants 
and the public library and behind the firehouse were 
the attendees: just over a thousand people, who were, 
by one volunteer’s estimate, 90 percent women, mostly 
wearing shirts I did not understand: “TEAM ROBERT” 
and “babette ate oatmeal.”

Sometimes, you just gotta bite the bullet––or in this 
case, the strawberry balsamic ice cream made by the 
costume designer for Gilmore Girls. I kicked off Fri­
day afternoon with a debate on Rory’s best boyfriend 
(someone named “Jess” won), then moved on to a trivia 
game in which I embarrassed myself by with my abys­
mal knowledge of the Supreme Court. (The question 
was,: “Which real-life Supreme Court justice was in the 
Puffs?” The Puffs = an all-female secret society at Rory’s
