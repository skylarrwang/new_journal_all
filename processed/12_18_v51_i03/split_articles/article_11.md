weekend held for the last fifteen years and attended by Motor 
Cycle Clubs (MCs) from all over the country. Trinity explains 
that other clubs typically will not come to an event held at 
a church, out of fear of being judged by churchgoers for a 
lifestyle of drinking, smoking, and swearing. So R4R holds a 
prayer service in New Haven’s Career High School instead. 
Trinity says that even though other MCs “don’t ‘do church,’” 
they never fail to attend.

Other motorcycle groups differ from R4R not only in reli­
gious disposition, but also in their treatment of male and 
female riders. “Because we’re a motorcycle ministry, we’re 
kind of separated from protocol, from the [motorcycle club] 
world,” Trinity says. In many other clubs, men and women 
ride separately, she says.

Eve adds that although more women ride today, she shared 
the road with far fewer female riders when they first organized 
their motorcycle ministry. “When we started sixteen years ago, 
if you saw a woman on a motorcycle, you questioned their 
sexuality,” Eve says, prompting Sheba to exclaim, “Somebody 
asked me that yesterday! He said, ‘Are you gay?” I said, ‘No.’ 
He said, ‘I thought all women on bikes were gay.’ I was like, 
‘What?’” Once, while surveying bikes at a Harley-Davidson 
dealership with her husband, a man approached Eve and 
asked, “‘Did your husband get the sissy bar put on the back 
for when he’s riding you?’ I just looked at him and laughed,” 
Eve remembers. “I said, ‘Riding me? I rode that bike off the 
showroom floor.’” 

Before Trinity joined R4R, she was apprehensive about 
riding. She didn’t think it was possible for women who rode 
motorcycles to also be feminine. Yet, from the moment Trin­
ity learned to ride, she was hooked. “Now, I’m one of those 
women,” she says. “It became my serenity.”

When Trinity passed her license exam, she was sure to tell 
her husband that she’d beaten his score. “He said, ‘I don’t 
believe you can ride.’ I said ‘Pull your bike out,’” Trinity 
recalls. “I had hair rollers in my hair, I had bedroom slippers 
on. He was like, ‘You can’t ride with bedroom slippers on.’ I 
said, ‘Watch me.’”

Trinity began to spend all her spare time on her bike. She 
says that her dedication to riding has only grown since she 
lost her brother, also an R4R rider, to a motorcycle accident 
eleven years ago. The Ministry was out on the highway when, 
in the middle of a turn, Trinity’s brother accidentally veered 
onto the dirt. He flew off his bike. and died a month later in 
the hospital. Trinity says that her brother taught her a lot of 
what she knows about riding, and she has no intention of slow­
ing down. “I thought I would do him an injustice by stopping. 
Because he was passionate about riding. He was a rider rider.”

The passage from Matthew on the back of each motorcy­
clist’s vest reads, “Go ye therefore and teach all nations, bap­
tizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and 
of the Holy Ghost.” R4R’s motto is a corollary to the passage: 
“reaching the lost, one soul at a time.” As a ministry, R4R’s 
members fulfill their mission by helping freewheeling “souls.” 
But they also do this for each other. “They have come and 
cleaned my house, brought my family food, visited me every 
day in the hospital, picked my kids up from school—it’s not 
just an organization we’re part of,” Eve says. “When I say fam­
ily? Family.”
