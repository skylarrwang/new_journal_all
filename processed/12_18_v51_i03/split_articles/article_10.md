T
rinity sits with her manicured hands folded neatly, 
flanked by her fellow Christian motorcyclists on a 
black leather couch. Mary Magdalene, Zephaniah, and II 
Timothy sit to her left; Sheba and Eve to her right. 
“I like to wear pumps when I ride,” Trinity says. “My hus­
band doesn’t like it, but I like the look.” Sheba, whose name 
appears on a black, diamond-bedazzled headband and in a 
tattoo in Gothic lettering on her right arm, laughs in agree­
ment. “I wear a dress with leggings on my bike all the time.”


Each motorcyclist wears a bright red shirt under a leather 
vest embroidered with a rider name (“Zephaniah”), a leader­
ship position (“Road Captain”), and various patches ranging 
from crosses to quotes like “Christians aren’t perfect...just for­
given.” The back of each vest is emblazoned with a canary-yel­
low Bible inscribed with Matthew 28:19-20 and a crest that 
reads, “Rydas 4 Righteousness: Motorcycle Ministry.”


Trinity (legally, Melanie Perry) is the president of the Con­
necticut chapter of Rydas 4 Righteousness. To put it simply, 
members say, R4R is “a church on wheels,” bringing Chris­
tianity to communities by motorcycle rather than requiring 
individuals to come to church themselves. R4R was founded 
in 2002 by Trinity’s husband, Solomon (legally, Arthur Perry), 
who is currently the ministry’s national president. Now in its 
sixteenth year, R4R maintains chapters in Ohio, North Caro­
lina, and Connecticut.


Riding makes spreading the word of God far easier for the 
eighteen-member chapter, and allows them to bring a new 
approach to traditional ministry work. “I wanted to be that 
light,” Sheba says. “I just wanted to be different.” Eve, a 
member with black, thick-rimmed glasses, short, dyed-blonde 
hair, and glittering diamond hoops, echoed her sentiment. “I 
thought that combining ministry and motorcycles, because 
[each is] just something that I’ve always had a love for—it’s 
just the best thing since running water for me,” she says.


As a co-ed, mostly Black motorcycle club, R4R challenges 
what people see in movies like Hell Ride and Wild Hogs and 
hear in songs like “Motorcycle Man”—motorcycle culture is 
typically portrayed as non-religious, male, white, and feloni­
ous. The women of R4R defy stereotypes. “Just by seeing a 
female on a bike, [spectators] are going to stop me, and they’re 
gonna wanna know, ‘Wow. You’re a woman, you’re riding a 
bike. Why?’ Then I get into my name, then I get into my 
Scripture, and then it opens up the door for ministry,” says 
Trinity.


The ministry’s members primarily focus on prayer and 
community outreach. Over the past five years, R4R has held 
a back-to-school backpack drive, built homes for Habitat For 
Humanity, given away turkeys and hams on Thanksgiving, 
and sponsored a “Lupus Ride” to raise donations for the Amer­
ican Lupus Foundation. As for prayer, the ministry readily 
assembles when others call on them. “I wanna say we’re like 
first responders,” Eve says. Her fellow members murmur in 
agreement. Other motorcycle groups call on R4R when prayer 
is needed, and the group comes to people’s homes to pray for 
family members who have died.


R4R’s biggest event by far is its “Annual Bike Blessing”
