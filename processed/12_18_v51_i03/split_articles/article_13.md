Ferraro, a silver-haired former factory owner and 
registered Democrat, cast his vote for Bob Stefanowski 
in the gubernatorial race. An Italian immigrant who 
arrived to the United States thirty years ago, he feels 
gun control reform is unnecessary, approves of Don­
ald Trump’s policies thus far, and expressed disdain 
for undocumented immigrants. McClease, a Doc 
Martens-clad millennial who said she has worked in 
public service, believes America is behind the rest of 
the world in terms of affordable healthcare, education, 
immigration and gun policy. Above all, she empha­
sized how uncomfortable she feels navigating the cur­
rent political climate, especially as a person of color.
“There are other things that play into America 
besides just being fair,” she said. “There are things like 
racial inequality. That’s a real thing in America, it’s not 
made up, it exists.”

In a rare moment of agreement, Ferraro said he had 
biracial grandchildren, and he was worried about how 
they would be treated in the future. “They’re going 
to experience the world differently, and that’s sad,” 
McClease said.

As Ferraro and McClease prepared to part ways, 
they discovered that Ferraro’s wife had grown up with 
McClease’s father in New Haven. “Small world!” they 
both declared, laughing as they departed into the night.
