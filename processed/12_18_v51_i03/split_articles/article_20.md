EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
When I told people that I learned Korean over the summer 
of 2013, they assumed I went to Korea, not that I lived with 
five other teenage girls in a cabin named for a North Korean 
work camp on the shores of Turtle Lake in Bemidji, Minnesota.

At Korean language immersion camp, we all wore hanboks 
at least once. We ate bulgogi and bibimbap, omelet rice and 
sundubu jjigae. We did taekwondo, sang Korean children’s 
songs, learned traditional dances and ate with chopsticks. Our 
counselors planned a pretend trip to Jeju Island, a street food 
tour, a casino night. We watched Wolf Boy and Taegukgi. 
We learned how to make patbingsu, and bought socks with 
embroidered images of our favorite Kpop idols at the village 
shop using Korean Won. At Camp Sup Sogui Hosu, Korean 
for Lake in the Woods, the name I was given at the beginning 
of the summer was Ju Ri. I’m a Jewish kid from Chicago and 
my actual name is Julia.

It’s humid in the North Woods in July and every day I wore 
jean shorts. The full face of makeup I put on dripped and 
smudged. I applied fuchsia eyeliner to my waterline and the 
little kids at the camp accused me of having pink eye. My 
braces had orange and blue rubber bands on them, and I 
had a multicolored hair wrap with a plastic bead at the end. 
There’s a photo of me from camp wearing a beige polyester 
button down with camels on it, presenting in front of the sixty 
or so other campers whatever Korean I had learned that week. 
I wore that shirt yesterday.

When you’re growing up you can’t choose your life, but you 
can choose your obsession.

When I was fifteen, I played the clarinet and piano seriously. I collected glass bottles and cardboard boxes and took 
painting classes. I did my trig homework and learned how to 
drive. I was in a mother-daughter book club, and when I went 
to homecoming, I was too awkward to dance. On weekends, 
I watched my brother’s friends play Call of Duty and Smash 
and for 2012 I threw an End of The World sleepover. On the 
one-year anniversary of my Bat Mitzvah my dad came out as 
gay and my parents got divorced. I wasn’t obsessed with any of 
these things.

Really, I spent my early teens tucked under the covers of 
my bed watching hours of subtitled music videos, live stages, 
reality shows, variety shows, hidden cameras and interviews. 
I was busy consuming the shiny world of Korean production 
companies’ perfectly manufactured celebrities, who are literally called idols. I watched members of Kpop groups ranking 
themselves by their looks, introducing themselves and their 
prescribed personas: the maknae, the visual, the leader, the 
rapper. I watched a reality show that gave teenaged idols a 
baby to raise. I listened to Kpop’s addictive EDM beat on 
repeat while backpacking in the Grand Canyon over winter 
break.

Growing up is deciding what you like and don’t like. When 
you decide that you really, really like something, maybe something that no one else likes, that’s now who you are.

I got into Kpop early, before Gangnam Style, before BTS. 
I spent hours combing kshow123, soompi and dailymotion 
for subtitled videos. I was literally there watching as each of 
EXO’s teaser videos dropped, as Gee became the first Kpop 
video to reach 100 million views. I was a member of fan 
clubs—a V.I.P, an ELF, a Shawol, an EXOL.

Kpop is a global phenomenon. In 1993 Jurassic Park featured Hyundai cars and the Korean company’s sales spiked by 
1.5 million. The South Korean government noticed that pop 
culture can make a country a lot of money. By 2012, South 
Korea had allocated a billion dollars to fund Korean pop 
culture. The “Hallyu Wave,” the increase in South Korean 
culture’s global popularity since the nineties, exports Kpop 
as a significant portion of the country’s economy. Kpop videos have comments in French, Russian, Arabic, German and 
Hindi. In Peru, 2NE1 music videos play on TVs in department stores. Super Junior recently has promoted songs titled 
“Lo Siento” and “Mamacita.” Kpop groups release albums in 
Japanese and Chinese. Song titles are usually in English, and 
lyrics often have phrases like “move it,” “break it,” “under my 
skin,” “fantastic,” and “I love it love it.”

At the beginning of eighth grade a friend from orchestra 
sent me a link over Facebook Messenger of SHINee’s music 
video for “Lucifer.” I was instantly hooked. I watched the five 
beautiful, effeminate, men with bleached asymmetrical hair 
dressed in leather and mesh dancing in metallic spinning 
rooms over and over again. I practiced my scales resting my 
clarinet sheet music on my computer screen with SHINee 
playing in the background. I watched Kpop and pretended 
that my parents weren’t yelling at each other outside my door.

I tried being into One Direction or Sherlock or Justin Bieber like other kids I knew, but couldn’t find anything to grasp 
onto. Kpop was prettier and brighter, kitschier, more theatrical. It was all-consuming. When I finished watching Super 
Junior’s talk shows going all the way back to 2008, I moved 
onto 2NE1 and then Block B and then MBLAQ. Being a 
Kpop fan is having ten different biases in ten different groups. 
It’s memorizing the exact second of a music video your favorite member looks at the camera and winks.

When I was a teenager, the Hallyu Wave was extremely 
pure. It remains an industry where idols have no-dating 
clauses written into their contracts and a 27-year-old singer 
is assumed to be a virgin. Idols claim that their fans are their 
girlfriends. Idols often talk about their ideal type in interviews: 
a puppy-like personality, someone who smiles with their teeth 
and has a cute aura, someone who doesn’t wear heels. That’s 
literally me, fans say. They are fourteen years old and sheltered 
and naive and imagine that they are in love.

Camp Sup Sogui Hosu was populated by Korean adoptees, 
Korean Americans, kids who had Korean friends, kids who 
really liked Taekwondo, and, of course, the majority: Midwestern kids like me who were obsessed with Kpop who were not 
Korean. A lot of kids at camp wished they were Korean. They 
wished they dated a flower boy, that they could see SHINee 
perform live, that they could move to Seoul and teach English. 
One girl who had blond hair and did revolutionary war reenactments at home wore makeup to make her look Korean.

No one talked about it. We said we were all just there to 
learn a language. But the truth was that many of us weren’t 
there due to genuine interest in the history or politics or fine 
arts or customs of Korea. We dreamed about our lives being 
like k-dramas, where we’d trip and somehow fall right into the 
arms of a rich heir, who’d hate us at first, but we’d woo them 
with our endearing quirks and eventually fall in love.

Sup Sogui Hosu’s website says it creates “a place that is 
both culturally authentic and uniquely our own.” Bemidji, 
Minnesota, called “The First City On The Mississippi,” is 
the self-proclaimed curling capital of the United States and 
the alleged birthplace of Paul Bunyan. It happens to also be 
home to the Concordia Language Villages, fifteen language 
immersion camps clustered around Turtle Lake, all run by 
Concordia College. On the villages’ website, Concordia says 
that they are “builders of globally minded communities and 
guides to world fluency.” Each camp markets reasons why 
American kids should learn their language. Russian camp 
offers the chance to “enjoy great literature!” Why learn Danish? To “Unlock the secrets of happiness!”

Sup Sogui Hosu is not an authentic Korean experience. 
It’s Korea accessibly served to teenage Midwesterners as a fun 
summer activity. Sup Sogui Hosu is the digital world of the 
Hallyu Wave made physical. But it’s also an American summer camp. We canoed and played UNO and ate s’mores. All 
summer long, my arms were covered with mosquito bites and 
my face was sunburned and peeling. One weekend we all 
went to a laundromat in town and downloaded kakaotalk and 
sent little winking cats to each other. We went to a shop that 
sold drug rugs and incense in a nearly abandoned mall and I 
downloaded the Hangul keyboard on my phone and put my 
friends’ Korean names in my contacts. Then we ate at a Perkins, a family-friendly dining chain. I ordered meatloaf.

The camp’s representation of Korean culture was distilled 
down to Kpop. We wrote letters to our favorite idols, and 
formed our own Kpop groups amongst ourselves. The counselors organized a game of Running Man based off of the 
variety show. We did morning exercises just like Korean high 
school students in TV dramas. Before bed we played our favorite Kpop songs. The girl who slept in the bunk across from 
mine taped pictures of Bi, Siwon and G-Dragon to the wall.

I first went to Korean camp because my friends and I had 
decided to do something together over the summer. Rachel 
learned languages as a hobby and Joanna was Korean, so we 
decided on Korean. I was devastatingly embarrassed of my 
obsession and would have never learned Korean otherwise. 
I wanted to feel superior to the Kpop-obsessed koreaboos at 
camp who held up double Victory signs in all their pictures. 
That is not me, I said to myself, even though at that point all 
my YouTube ads were in Korean. At camp, I pretended to mispronounce the names of Kpop groups. I told inappropriately 
timed jokes and was loud and obnoxious. I was self-conscious 
and was confronted with the fact that I was a type: a fourteen 
year old white girl Kpop fan, and that no, I wasn’t unique or 
especially worldly. I felt the koreaboos embarrassed themselves by calling the boys “oppa,” by wearing shirts of their 
favorite groups, by doing aegyo, by saying “fighting!” or “daebak!” or “omo!”

After camp was over, the counselors who were from Korea 
flew out of O’Hare. Rachel and I took them to H&M and Top 
Shop on Michigan Avenue. We ate at the Cheesecake Factory and spoke in Korean. Won Jae told me that Sup Sogui 
Hosu was uglier than Seoul, that the food at camp was barely 
Korean. I told him that I would come and visit.

“Conjuring,” Won Jae commented on my profile picture 
a month after camp ended. I responded in Korean. I’m not 
sure if I ever spoke Korean again after that. I definitely haven’t 
visited.


In eighth grade homeroom, I wrote a letter to myself to be 
opened on high school graduation. When I opened my letter 
it read “please please please 
don’t forget Yesung and Jonghyun and T.O.P. You probably 
still love Super Junior and 
SHINee and MBLAQ. Hopefully you’ve learned Korean 
by now!”

But at the same time as I 
wrote that, I had nightmares 
about being in my twenties and still tucked in bed 
in front of the computer 
watching 
other 
people’s 
lives, yearning for a place I 
wasn’t in, imagining myself 
as someone else surrounded 
by different people. Growing 
up is boring and sometimes 
lonely. You look in the mirror 
and you have acne and braces 
and you’re wearing animal print and you have a middle part 
and your parents just got divorced and you wished things were 
different. At 3 a.m., as I started in on my seventh hour of a 
k-drama, I would be filled with dread that I’d never be able 
to escape the world of Kpop and be happy to just live my own 
life.

I thought something monumental would have to happen 
to pull me away from Kpop, but what actually happened was 
underwhelming. Kpop had always been the best thing in the 
world, and it still was, but suddenly, I found myself drifting 
away from it. By the end of sophomore year, passively consuming media didn’t make me happy. When I was sixteen, my dad 
married my stepdad and I started biking the fourteen miles to 
school instead of driving. I threw up in my friend’s car after a 
Halloween party, I cut all my hair off, I taught Hebrew school 
and started a klezmer band. Life went on.

And so did Kpop. At my high school graduation rehearsal 
the kids I had grown up with sat bored in the pews of Rockefeller Chapel and a friend and I watched EXO’s newest music 
video. My senior year, three friends and I drove to buy Dean’s 
album at a store in Chinatown. I watched Weightlifting Fairy 
Kim Bong Soo and Show Me the Money 4. Last year I made 
three different Kpop playlists on Spotify and deleted all of 
them. But now, as I watch a movie with friends, I don’t wish I 
was watching Kpop interviews instead.

Now, other girls from Sup Sogui Hosu have their names 
in Korean on their Facebook pages with profile pictures of 
the Korean children they teach or now are students at Yonsei University. I’m at a US college studying architecture and 
speak no foreign languages fluently. Kpop moved on without 
me while I moved on without it.

Still, Kpop is one of the things that I’ve spent the most time 
thinking about in my life, and I haven’t been able to just let 
go completely. Last year Jonghyun from SHINee committed 
suicide and I was devastated. On the Ring Ding Dong 
music video, a YouTube user named “x blossom” commented, 
“When you grew up with SHINee and you hear that Jonghyun 
passed away, that feels like you lost a family member. That’s 
how much it hurts. Rest in peace my childhood.”

That’s what Kpop was for me. Kpop idols were the characters that populated my childhood, and Korean camp was the 
last time I remember being treated like a kid.

At Sup Sogui Hosu, I liked pickled garlic the most out of all 
the side dishes. At the end of camp Won Jae led me up to the 
stage at the front of the cafeteria and crowned me “Miss Garlic” and put a sash over my shoulder. He fed me sixteen cloves 
of garlic in front of everyone while they sang and clapped. 
And no matter what I achieve in my adulthood, that will be 
my proudest moment.
