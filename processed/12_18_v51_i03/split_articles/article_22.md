O
n November 14, 2017, Jesica Springer was at 
rehearsal for the Yale Dramatic Association’s pro­
duction of Dreamgirls when a twelve-pound disco ball fell 
on her head. The following day, she went to Yale Health, 
where a doctor told her she would recover within two 
weeks. She continued to attend classes, and tried to ignore 
the headaches that worsened each time she looked at the 
board or her notebook.
But Springer, then in her first semester at Yale, did not 
get better. Once, she got lost during the three-minute walk 
from Saybrook College to her room in Vanderbilt Hall. In a 
moment she no longer remembers, she shoved a classmate 
to the ground. Per doctor’s orders, she could only work for 
ninety minutes a day, in half-hour intervals. On December 
7, the second-to-last day of classes, Springer withdrew from 
Yale. “I was not cognitively capable of keeping up with my 
work, or taking my finals,” she told me. “If I kept push­
ing the way I was, I would have damaged my brain perma­
nently.” To withdraw, Springer sent a nineteen-word email 
to her dean. At the time, she had no idea that she would 
have to navigate a months-long, bewildering, bureaucratic 
process just to become a student again.

In 2015, one week into First-Year Scholars at Yale, a 
summer program in which incoming students take English 
114, an introductory writing class, Charelle Brown’s father 
passed away back in New Mexico. After missing class for 
a week to attend the funeral, she ultimately failed the 
summer course. “My family didn’t expect me to finish the 
program,” she said. “I was struggling to get writing. It took 
me a while to process losing my dad, and I lost him at a 
time when I had to produce a lot of writing. I was just so 
scared to write again.” Brown had to take a writing class 
to complete her first-year requirements and advance to 
sophomore standing. She enrolled in a writing course both 
semesters of her first year, but withdrew each time. “It was 
so severe—that fear of writing and producing things,” she 
said. Brown spent the summer of 2016 at home in Santo 
Domingo Pueblo (Kewa), New Mexico, seeing to family 
responsibilities and taking English 120 online. It was her 
last opportunity to complete the required writing credit and 
gain the eight credits she needed to advance to sophomore 
standing. When she arrived at Yale for her sophomore year 
that August, her grade for the online course was not yet 
available.

One day that September, toward the end of shopping 
period, Brown was called to a meeting with Ezra Stiles Head 
of College Steven Pitti and Dean Nilakshi Parndigamage. 
Brown had failed the summer class, Parndigamage said. 
She would be forced to withdraw. Brown said the admin­
istrators seemed apologetic, and that they emphasized that 
they were reading the official policy to her. “They told me 
that I had seventy-two hours to leave campus from the end 
of that meeting,” Brown said. “[They] made it seem like 
[by being here] I was going to put the university in danger, 
which was strange, because somehow, being withdrawn for 
an academic reason makes you a threat.”

Springer, Brown, and every other student who withdraws 
from Yale has to complete a uniform and lengthy list of 
tasks, regardless of the reason for their withdrawal. Often, 
the path to reinstatement requires spending thousands of 
dollars on plane tickets and classes at other colleges. In 
recent years, administrators’ efforts to reform the process 
or even enforce Yale’s existing rules have been uneven 
and inconsistent, leaving students frustrated and confused. 
Yale does not publicize statistics about how many students 
withdraw or are reinstated per year. This fall, I spoke with 
nine students who are either currently enrolled after being 
reinstated, or are still withdrawn. Their stories reveal the 
complex and often alienating process of applying for rein­
statement.

There are five reasons why a student may withdraw from 
Yale: personal, financial, academic, disciplinary, and medi­
cal. Personal withdrawals cannot be forced, while financial, 
academic, and disciplinary withdrawals are rarely voluntary; 
only health–related cases can be either. Mental health–
related issues are the most common cause for withdrawal, 
according to Sara Samuel, a 2015 graduate who served on 
a committee that reviewed Yale policies around withdrawal 
and reinstatement. To withdraw, a student sends an email 
to their residential college dean, who forwards it to the

Yale College Dean’s Office. The Dean’s Office notifies the 
University Registrar’s Office, which changes the student’s 
status in Yale’s online systems from ‘Full-Time Enrolled’ to 
‘Withdrawn,’ creating a formal separation between school 
and student, said Deputy Registrar Shonna Marshall.

Withdrawals are different from Leaves of Absences, 
which are always voluntary. Students in good academic 
standing can decide to take a Leave of Absence within the 
first fifteen days of a term. They can leave for up to two 
semesters, and while away, they remain affiliated with Yale. 
To return, a student on leave simply emails their college 
dean. Yet withdrawn students wishing to return must begin 
a long and complex reinstatement process, regardless of the 
reason for which they withdrew, and whether or not it was 
voluntary.

Once a student’s status is changed to ‘withdrawn,’ several 
changes take place, removing digital facets of their student­
hood one by one. Information Technology Services sets the 
student’s email account to expire, and the ID Center deac­
tivates the student’s swipe access after seventy-two hours. 
From then on, withdrawn students are barred from cam­
pus in perpetuity. “They may come to campus only upon 
receiving prior permission from their residential college 
dean or the Dean of Student Affairs,” state the academic 
regulations of the Yale College Program of Studies. Risa 
Sodi, Assistant Dean of Academic Affairs and the chair of 
the Reinstatement Committee, told me in an email that 
“students found to be on campus may be reported to their 
residential college deans or the campus police. In addition, 
anyone on campus who feels threatened by a withdrawn 
student can also call campus police.”

Yale administrators often frame reinstatement as an 
application gauging readiness: Is a student ready to come 
back to Yale? Will they be able to succeed in a stressful aca­
demic or social environment? Or—especially in the case 
of mental health withdrawals—will reinstatement exacer­
bate the challenges that forced them to withdraw in the 
first place?

Over the last four years, three Yale students have com­
mitted suicide after withdrawing and re-enrolling: Luchang 
Wang in 2015, Hale Ross in 2016, and Thomas Lawrence 
earlier this year. After Wang’s death at the beginning of the 
spring semester in 2015, public conversation on campus 
shifted towards examining policies around mental health 
services, withdrawal, and reinstatement, at least tempo­
rarily. In February 2015, the Yale Daily News published a 
series of editorials criticizing the process; in a heated town 
hall with university administrators later that month, previ­
ously withdrawn students did the same.  
On November 5, a 2018 alumna, referred to as Z.P. in 
legal documents, filed a lawsuit against Yale. She claimed 
Yale–New Haven Hospital held her for involuntary mental 
health treatment and disclosed confidential information to 
administrators, who forced her to withdraw from the Uni­
versity in November 2016. The suit alleges that Jonathan 
Holloway, then Dean of Yale College and one of twelve 
defendants in the suit, denied her appeal to remain at 
Yale. Z.P. was reinstated in fall 2017 and graduated this 
past spring. In her suit, she claims that Yale required her to 
withdraw as a preventative measure “due to her health and 
the recent suicides of two students,” even though she had 
demonstrated “improved mood and coping skills.” She saw 
Yale as “a refuge from her stressful home environment,” the 
suit went on, and wanted to stay on campus. While Z.P.’s 
allegations have not yet been brought to trial, they bring 
forth important questions about forced withdrawal: What 
reasons does Yale have for requiring a student to spend time 
away from campus? Do its requirements for readmission 
function in students’ best interests? And how can Yale act 
proactively to ensure students’ wellbeing while responding 
to the individual needs of those who withdraw?

When students who have withdrawn hope to be rein­
stated, they must submit a personal statement and gather 
two letters of support from instructors or employers. They 
must spend as many as two terms away from Yale “construc-
