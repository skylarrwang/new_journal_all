fficer Osvaldo Garcia rubbed his eyes 
and yawned as he slumped into the driver’s 
seat of his police cruiser. “It’s been a long day,” 
he sighed. But it was about to get much longer. 
For four hours, Garcia and I would sit idling in 
a parking lot in The Hill, a neighborhood just 
west of downtown New Haven, our only company 
the intermittent crackle of Garcia’s radio and the 
whoosh of cars careening down Columbus Ave­
nue.

Garcia is tall with close-cropped black hair, and 
muscular in his bulletproof vest and police uni­
form. Despite having joined the police force only 
six years ago, he affects the world-weariness and 
resignation of a grizzled veteran. For much of our 
evening together, Garcia groused about the police 
force’s long hours, low pay, and byzantine rules 
and regulations.

Early in his career as an officer, Garcia told me, 
he made a drug arrest almost every night, but he 
got tired of picking up so many people for minor 
infractions. Now, a new initiative from the New 
Haven city government is trying to reduce the 
number of arrests for low-level offenses. When 
Garcia is in the position to make a drug arrest, 
he has a new option: he can offer the offender a 
chance to partake in a new city program, called 
Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion, or LEAD, 
that provides a restorative alternative to the crimi­
nal justice system.

As the evening wound to a close, we hadn’t seen 
a single person come through the empty lot. But 
even if we had, Garcia admitted there really wasn’t 
much of a chance that I’d get to see the program in 
action — he and most of his fellow officers rarely 
think of using it.

A new model of policing has reduced 
recidivism in Seattle and Albany. But a year 
after New Haven adopted a similar program, 
community leaders say the city has fallen 
short.

In late 2017, New Haven announced the cre­
ation of a LEAD pilot. Based on a national model 
pioneered in cities such as Seattle and Albany, 
LEAD gives police officers the jurisdiction to 
divert low-level offenders away from the criminal 
justice system and into community based harm-re­
duction programs. The program is entirely discre­
tionary — an officer can choose whether or not to 
offer LEAD to an offender, and the offender can 
refuse the offer and opt for arrest if they so wish. 
In other cities, the model seems to be working. 
A 2017 study found that Seattle’s LEAD program 
reduced recidivism by nearly 60 percent and that 
LEAD participants were significantly more likely 
to find housing and employment. Social justice 
advocates hailed the success of LEAD in Seat­
tle as a paradigm shift in the city’s approach to 
law enforcement, especially at a time of strained 
police-community relations. LEAD in New Haven 
began with similar hopes, but in the past year, 
a combination of leadership changes, minimal 
transparency, and a lack of community involve­
ment have jeopardized the program’s success. 
LEAD’s roots in New Haven can be traced back 
to the fall of 2016, when a series of sex-work stings 
by the NHPD drew the ire of community activ­
ists, who called on the city to find a rehabilitative 
approach to addressing low-level crimes, accord­
ing to Jane Mills, a leader of the local criminal 
justice reform group People Against Injustice. 
The following spring, city officials signed a 
Memorandum of Understanding with various 
state agencies and community groups, promising 
to involve “community stakeholders and advo­
cates” and “bring their important perspectives and 
expertise to the process.” After traveling to Seattle 
to learn more about the LEAD program there, city 
officials, in the spring of 2017, applied for — and 
eventually acquired — a $75,000 grant from the 
Department of Justice. In late November 2017, 
the pilot officially began in the Downtown, Hill 
North, and Hill South neighborhoods. 
Once the program got underway, however, 
community leaders like Stacy Spell of Project 
Longevity, a Connecticut-based law enforcement 
initiative to reduce gun violence, found that the 
city was no longer receptive to their input.
 “Initially, when LEAD was exploring apply­
ing for the grant, Project Longevity was brought 
in because we are a law enforcement program as
