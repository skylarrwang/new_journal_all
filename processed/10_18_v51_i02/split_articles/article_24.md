Around two o’clock in the morning, on May 8, Lolade 
Siyonbola woke up from a nap. Siyonbola, a Black gradu­
ate student who lived in Yale’s Hall of Graduate Studies, 
had fallen asleep on a couch in a common room while 
working on a paper. When Siyonbola woke up, Sarah 
Braasch, a white graduate student who also lived in the 
building, confronted her. Braasch hadn’t recognized Siy­
onbola, and called the police on her while she was sleep­
ing. As captured by Siyonbola’s video recording of their 
conversation, Brach intoned, as if disciplining a child, “I 
have every right to call the police,” nodding her head as 
she spoke. “You cannot sleep in that room,” she explained. 
She snapped pictures of Siyonbola on her phone.


“Continue,” Siyonbola told her quietly. “Continue. Get 
my good side.” It took the Yale Police Department only five 
minutes to reach the building.


Following YPD protocol, the two officers who arrived 
initially asked Siyonbola to provide her student ID. After 
she demonstrated that she could open the door to her 
apartment with her keys, the officers continued to press 
her for her ID. She relented, handing them her wallet. 
Upstairs, a third officer also checked Braasch’s identifica­
tion. But with Siyonbola, a problem arose that took fifteen 
minutes to sort out; the name on her ID was a nickname, 
Lolade, which didn’t match her legal name in the Yale 
Police’s database, Ololade. “I deserve to be here,” Siy­
onbola told the officers as she waited for them to allow her 
to go. “I paid tuition like everybody else. I am not going to 
justify my existence here.”


Over the course of a few days, Siyonbola’s video record­
ing of the incident garnered over 1.5 million views on 
Facebook Live. National news outlets from CNN to The 
New York Times reported on the story. Jean-Louis Rene­
son, another Black graduate student, posted on Facebook 
that Braasch had called the police on him three months 
before, when he was lost in HGS and had tried to ask her 
for directions. Four police officers arrived in response to 
that call, and left upon realizing that Reneson was a stu­
dent. Reneson declined to comment for this article, and 
Siyonbola did not respond to multiple requests for com­
ment. After Siyonbola posted the video online, a petition 
calling for Braasch’s removal from the Graduate School 
of Arts and Sciences gathered 3,000 signatures; Braasch 
remains a student at Yale. President Peter Salovey, Yale 
College Dean Marvin Chun, and Secretary and Vice 
President for Student Life Kimberly Goff-Crews sent out 
University-wide emails in which a series of meetings and 
“listening sessions” with students were promised and com­
mitments to diversity and inclusion were renewed. The 
event became so infamous that students still refer to it as 
“what happened at HGS.”


The HGS encounter is one of several accounts of biased 
policing brought forth by students and New Haven com­
munity members in recent years. This piece reports two 
new sets of allegations — one at GPSCY, Yale’s grad stu­
dent bar; the other at an off-campus venue — not previ­
ously covered in the media. These events raise questions 
about the role of the police on Yale’s campus. When does 
policing at Yale draw a boundary between those who are 
presumed to belong on campus and those who aren’t? How 
far should the YPD go to enforce borders between Yale and 
the surrounding city? When is a 911 call a plea for safety, 
and when is it a method of exclusion?

In the middle of the night on January 11, 1824, some­
one—likely a Yale student—seized the body of Batsheba 
Smith, the deceased daughter of a farmer, from her West 
Haven grave. The thief stowed the body on the floor of the 
Yale Medical College cellar, folding her corpse so it would 
look like a pile of clothes. When the New Haven consta­
ble discovered the body and news got around, six hundred 
outraged citizens gathered in front of the Medical College 
building, armed with weapons and stones. “Tear down the 
College,” they chanted, until city guards stepped in and 
arrested some of the rioters.


As Yale’s website tells the story, this riot was the reason 
the city assigned two New Haven Police officers, Bill Wiser 
and Jim Donnelly, to regularly patrol the campus. The Uni­
versity later hired Wiser and Donnelly, making them the 
inaugural officers of the first private university police force 
in the nation.


It’s unclear whether the riot was actually the cause of 
the start of the Yale Police, as Wiser and Donnelly weren’t 
assigned to police Yale until 1894 – a good seventy years 
after the body-snatching incident. Yet the riot perhaps 
exemplified the rocky relationship between the school and 
the city that led to the department’s founding. In his autobi­
ography, Wiser wrote that he and Donnelly were appointed 
to police Yale because “many stories were told of the trou­
bles and fights between the students on the one side and 
the city police and citizens on the other.” Wiser and Don­
nelly’s primary role was to defend Yale students from their 
neighbors, rather than the other way around. “As outlined 
by the police,” he wrote, “our duties were to protect the stu­
dents, their property, and all college property from injury.” 
According to Wiser, intruders had been wandering onto 
university land and stealing students’ belongings. Early in 
his position at the university, Wiser found himself kicking 
“tramps” out of the basements and forcing a “colored gen­
tleman” to leave one of the building entrances. “The first 
thing to do, it seemed to us,” he wrote, “was to keep all 
suspicious characters from the campus.”


Yale students initially regarded Wiser and Donnelly 
with mistrust, regarding them as outsiders and discplinar­
ians. Yet the officers managed to endear themselves to the 
community. They taught students to sew on buttons and 
counseled them through periods of homesickness. In time, 
they were given lodging in campus dorms. As Wiser tells 
it, the pair grew so attached to the college that when the 
city police department sought to reassign them to a differ­
ent post, Wiser and Donnelly quit and were subsequently 
appointed by the University as “special constables,” now 
private employees.


For decades, the Yale Police Department remained 
relatively small. But in the 1960s and ’70s, student pro­
tests erupted across the country as part of the Civil Rights 
Movement and the flurry of activism against the Vietnam 
War. In response, more and more universities began to 
form their own police departments, hiring officers who 
were trained to interact with college students. By 2012, 
according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 75 percent 
of over 900 four-year colleges surveyed across the country 
employed an armed police force. 86 percent of campus 
police officers had the power to arrest in regions beyond 
the campus borders.


In the ’70s, Yale expanded its force and tightened its 
training programs and standards for officers. At first, the 
university attempted to downplay the YPD’s status as a 
police force; officers utilized unmarked cars and wore suits 
as uniforms. John W. Powell, a campus security consultant 
who served as Director of Security and Associate Dean of 
Students from 1960 to 1968, described the department’s 
transition to blue uniforms that more closely resembled 
city police officers’ attire, mimicking the NHPD so as to 
project an image of safety and deter crime.


Appearances aside, important distinctions remain 
between the Yale Police Department and its New Haven 
counterpart. On May 16 of this year, the New Haven Inde­
pendent wrote that it had filed a request for the Yale Police 
Department’s body-camera footage of the Hall of Graduate 
Studies incident in May under the Connecticut Freedom 
of Information Act (FOIA), which requires all public agen­
cies to provide access to their records and files when asked. 
The Department denied their request, citing a need to pre­
serve the privacy of the students involved under the Fam­
ily Educational Rights and Privacy Act, as well as a legal 
exception that allows them to withhold materials related to 
“uncorroborated allegations.” Had Siyonbola not recorded 
the HGS incident on her phone, no evidence corroborat­
ing her experience would have been publicly accessible.


In fact, as the Independent reported, the YPD has a 
history of denying FOIA requests, bringing forth ques­
tions about the transparency the public can expect from 
a private police force. In 2007, the Department rejected 
the FOIA request of a lawyer, Janet Perrotti, whose client 
claimed to have been racially profiled by an officer. At 
the time, the Yale Police claimed that as a private police 
force, it was not subject to FOIA at all. The Connecticut 
Freedom of Information Commission (FOIC) sided with 
Perrotti. If the Department could arrest people and put 
them in jail, the Commission concluded, it should have 
to disclose requested materials to the public under FOIA.


But the following year, after the Yale Police union 
requested that the Department disclose the salaries of top 
officials, the FOIC ruled that the Department did not 
resemble a public agency in its financial operations, and 
thus did not need to disclose that information. Similar legal 
battles over whether FOIA applies to private university 
police forces have occurred in recent years at universities 
across the country, including Harvard and Notre Dame.


Yale Police Chief Ronnell Higgins calls the Yale Police 
Department “a private entity with a public purpose.” In 
this respect, the Yale Police Department is similar to a pri­
vate prison, or a charter school. And like these kinds of 
institutions, it faces the challenge of balancing the inter­
ests of its private organization with its obligations to the 
public.




Today, the Yale Police force has grown to 93 officers. It 
works alongside a Yale Security team, which, according 
to Yale’s website, “serves as the eyes and ears of the YPD” 
inside buildings and parking lots. Today, when someone 
dials 911 from an on-campus location, the phone call 
routes to the Yale Police Department. According to Chief 
Higgins, the YPD and the NHPD frequently collaborate; 
their detectives confer on major investigations, their patrol 
routes overlap, and they route calls to each other. Some­
times, officers from both departments will respond to a call 
together. YPD officers walk, bike, and drive along “beats,” 
or patrol routes, both within the campus boundaries and in 
areas adjacent to campus.


Since Yale’s recent expansion into the Dixwell neigh­
borhood with the opening of Benjamin Franklin and 
Pauli Murray colleges in 2017, Jeannia Fu, a student at 
the School of Public Health, has noticed an increased 
police presence in the area. Fu, who is Asian, has straight, 
cropped hair and speaks in a level, earnest tone. She has 
lived in New Haven for nine years and has been involved in 
activism against police brutality since a Bridgeport police 
officer fatally shot teenager Jayson Negron in May 2017.


Last spring, Fu and a friend, Amy Smoyer, an assistant 
professor at Southern Connecticut State University, saw 
three Yale officers talking to a group of Black boys, who 
she guesses were around 10 years old, along the bike path 
that runs between Pauli Murray and Yale Health. Fu said 
that as she walked up to them, the officers were taking 
down the boys’ names. Fu asked if the boys were all right. 
“They looked scared and didn’t say anything,” she said.

Last spring, Fu and a friend, Amy Smoyer, an Assis­
tant Professor at Southern Connecticut State Univer­
sity, saw three Yale officers talking to a group of Black 
boys, who she guesses were around 10 years old, along 
the bike path that runs between Pauli Murray and 
Yale Health. Fu said that as she walked up to them, 
the officers were taking down the boys’ names. Fu 
asked if the boys were all right. “They looked scared 
and didn’t say anything,” she said. While Smoyer was 
not close enough to hear the conversation between 
Fu and the officers, she confirmed the general details 
of Fu’s account.
Fu recalled that one of the officers asked her to step 
aside in an “agitated tone.” The officer instructed her 
not to speak to the kids, claiming that she was “incit­
ing them to push back,” Fu says. She remembers the 
officer mentioning that this was part of an “investiga­
tion.” The boys later explained to Fu that a Yale Secu­
rity officer had called the police on the kids.
Fu approached a security officer stationed nearby. 
The officer confirmed that she had been the one to 
call the police. When Fu inquired why she had called 
the police, the security officer, who is white, answered, 
“You know, these kids around these rough spots, you 
gotta teach them how to behave.” Fu remembered 
responding that she thought the officer was “racist,” at 
which point the officer grew angry and threatened to 
file a harassment complaint against her.
Later on, Fu wrote about the incident on her Face­
book page, encouraging those who were concerned to 
email Higgins directly. In a statement posted on the 
YPD’s Facebook page, which named Fu directly, Hig­
gins said that the emails he received were “derogatory 
and, in some cases, inflammatory.” Higgins asserted 
that there was “absolutely no racism in this situation, 
certainly not on the part of Yale police.” Higgins 
explained that the police were called because the kids 
were trying to enter one of the colleges, yet maintained 
that the officers spoke “politely and respectfully” to 
the kids. He noted that one of the officers recognized 
the kids, and that one of the kids remembered see­
ing the officer handing out Rice Krispie Treats over 
the summer. “As a proud resident of New Haven, as 
a police chief, and as an African-American, I am all 
too familiar with racism and how quickly hatred can 
spread—particularly on social media,” Higgins wrote.
From Fu’s perspective, the encounter exemplified a 
broader pattern of policing New Haven residents. She 
considers the Yale Police to be a mechanism by which 
Yale has gentrified New Haven. As Yale expands, it 
displaces New Haven residents, she says, and the 
YPD’s presence enforces the newly-drawn campus 
boundaries. “I think there was a lesson being taught 
that day about who can belong where,” she says of the 
encounter by the Benjamin Franklin gate.
“I deserve to be here,” Siyonbola told the 
officers. “I paid tuition like everybody else. 
I am not going to justify my existence here.”
Ronnell Higgins, Chief of the YPD, grew up in 
New Haven. His father was an NHPD officer, and 
encouraged him to pursue a career with the Yale 
Police. After serving as a corrections officer at Bridge­
port Correctional Facility, Higgins joined the Yale 
Police in 1997, and became Chief in 2011. He is now 
in his forties. As Janet Lindner, Yale’s Associate Vice 
President for Administration at the time, told the Yale 
Daily News, the Yale Police Chief hiring committee 
appreciated Higgins’ background as a longtime city 
resident. Higgins has prioritized a model of “commu­
nity policing” during his tenure as Chief, seeking to 
build ties between YPD officers and both the Yale and 
New Haven communities.
Higgins speaks in a steady, deep voice, and wears 
rectangular tortoiseshell glasses. His schedule is 
packed; after four months of attempts to schedule 
an interview, he agreed to speak with me for a total 
of fifteen minutes. We met in a conference room at 
the Office of Public Affairs and Communications on 
the corner of Whitney and Grove, at a long table that 
could seat at least sixteen people. We were joined only 
by Karen Peart, Yale’s Director of External Communi­
cations. A cardboard cutout of Handsome Dan, Yale’s 
bulldog mascot, greeted the waiting room sofas on the 
other side of a glass wall.
Higgins said that in the aftermath of the HGS inci­
dent, members of the Yale community have increas­
ingly voiced concerns to him about a perceived 
disconnect between Yale Police officers and the com­
munities they serve. “The reality is that we do a lot on 
and off campus,” Higgins said, referring to commu­
nity outreach. “It was troubling to me that people said 
that we could be doing more. People were astounded 
when they heard what our officers were doing.”
According to Higgins, Yale Police officers organize 
blood drives and collect school supply donations. 
They give regular talks at public schools. The Depart­
ment works with the FBI to co-run the Future Law 
Enforcement Youth Academy, which invites 26 high 
schoolers to stay in Yale dormitories for free for a week 
over the summer while learning about crime-fighting 
techniques.
Higgins said that after the HGS incident, one of 
his main priorities is to better publicize the Depart­
ment’s outreach efforts. He recently designated two 
officers to comprise a Community Outreach and 
Engagement Team; the officers will focus full-time on 
strengthening the Yale Police’s relationship with the 
community. In the couple of weeks that the team has
