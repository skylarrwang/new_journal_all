THE SCIENTIST AND THE SHRUB
P R O F I L E
Michael Donoghue is the world’s leading expert on a plant that no one’s ever heard of.
“
This is yesterday’s flower,” Michael Dono­
ghue said, pointing to a half-wilted bloom. He 
was standing in the middle of a greenhouse, sur­
rounded by students. The room was filled with insec­
tivorous plants and deciduous trees, the air heavy with 
pollen and moisture. The plant before Donoghue had 
heart-shaped leaves, a spindly stem wrapped around 
a wire brace like ivy, and two huge burgundy flowers 
that drooped despondently. It was labeled Aristolochia 
gigantea.

“And this is today’s,” Donoghue added, pointing 
to the larger bloom. He reached out, turned today’s 
flower around, and revealed a small, cream-colored 
capsule behind it. “Flies are lured into the calyx,” he 
explained, indicating the capsule, “and once inside, 
they’re trapped. They get drenched in pollen.” Then 
the flower wilts (it lasts only a day), the calyx collapses, 
and the flies escape—only to be caught again within 
the flower of another gigantea. And so the plant pol­
linates.

The students scribbled in their sketchbooks. They 
were all drawing the gigantea for a class in plant biol­
ogy: some artistically, others rather unartistically, but 
all with an attention to detail that they were slowly 
learning from their teacher. Donoghue stepped back 
and watched them. He is a short man with a habit of

dressing simply and practically, often in jeans and a plaid 
shirt. His thinning hair and thick beard both turned white 
long ago. He is 66. But his posture is excellent; his eyes are 
clear and blue; and his voice is calm and rhythmical—the 
sort of voice that could read pages out of the phone book 
without boring its listeners.

When you walk with Donoghue, he calls your attention 
to the tiny hairs on the stem of a tomato plant. He points out 
the scales on the fruit of an Annona cherimola, shows you 
the chitinous “sugar apple” of an Annona squamosa. And 
you have the strange feeling that he is teaching you how to 
see. It’s as if he’s handed you a pair of delicate glasses, and 
when you put them on you realize that the natural world 
has always been out-of-focus. Every leaf now tells a story; 
every piece of bark hints at its owner’s ancestry; every flower 
is a subtle contraption waiting for the attention of one who 
looks closely. Donoghue has always looked closely. He has 
built a career out of noticing the unnoticed.

For much of his life, Donoghue has studied a genus of 
about 165 shrubs and small trees called Viburnum. These 
shrubs were the subject of his dissertation and have been 
the primary focus of his research for the past decade. They 
are, according to him, not very interesting.

Viburnum isn’t one of those plants that grows to be a 
hundred feet tall. It doesn’t eat insects, or parasitize trees, 
or grow aerial roots that hang from its branches and extract 
excess water from the air. It has pretty flowers, but not huge, 
fly-trapping ones like the gigantea’s. It’s a shrub. It’s one of 
those plants that most ecologists don’t pay attention to.

So, why study it? Because Donoghue likes it and has 
since he was an undergraduate. Because Viburnum isn’t an 
extraordinary genus, so insights into its ancestry and genetic 
makeup translate into insights about many other plants. 
But most of all, because the more you look at something—
even an unremarkable something, such as Viburnum—the 
more interesting it becomes.

Miranda Sinnott-Armstrong has also studied Viburnum 
for six years. She’s one of Donoghue’s current graduate stu­
dents. “In some ways,” she told me, “Viburnum is interest­
ing precisely because it’s not that interesting.”

“Michael Donoghue” is a household name in the world 
of evolutionary biology. Look that name up on Google, 
and you’ll find a laundry list of awards, membership in two 
national academies, and a Sterling Professorship at Yale. 
Look that name up on Google Scholar, and you’ll find a 
list of over 250 scientific papers, some of which have been 
cited thousands of times. But if you page through that list of 
papers, ranked by number of citations, you won’t find one 
about Viburnum until the ninety-second entry.

 “Michael’s work in Viburnum isn’t well-known,” Erika 
Edwards told me. “That’s not what he’s famous for.”

Edwards was one of Donoghue’s graduate students from 
2000-2005; she is now his chief collaborator. She also 
studies Viburnum. Like Donoghue, she’s better known for 
her work in other fields. Both of them hope that, one day, 
Viburnum will be so well-understood that it will become a 
model for evolutionary biology: a completely solved prob­
lem, a genus with a perfectly charted ancestry. Maybe then 
people will pay attention to it. After all, Gregor Mendel’s 
peas were just unremarkable garden plants for most of his 
life, and his experiments were just the hobby of a friar who 
had too much time on his hands. Until those peas provided 
evidence for recessive and dominant traits, that is. Until 
that friar became the father of modern genetics.

“Viburnum is almost never cited, except by people like 
us. And we cite ourselves,” Donoghue told me. “I’m not 
doing the Viburnum thing to be popular. Nobody cares 
about Viburnum papers. But we’re going to make Vibur­
num famous.”

One afternoon in September, I joined Donoghue in his 
office: a spacious white room with desks cluttered by spec­
imens and walls covered by floral sketches. He handed me 
an old photograph that showed a middle-aged professor, 
four graduate students, and a younger, long-haired Dono­
ghue. They were standing and smiling together, shin-deep 
in a forest stream. “Most people can’t trace their career 
to one particular incident,” Donoghue said, leaning back 
from the table and smiling. “But I can.”

The Donoghue of this portrait was discovering, to his 
own surprise, that he was scientifically inclined. Ever since 
graduating from high school, this young Donoghue had 
travelled and camped across the country. He had hiked 
through the Canadian Rockies and spent three months 
fighting forest fires. He had drifted up to Alaska and spent a 
few months on Vancouver Island. He had seen most of the 
states. (Later in life, he would see them all.) And he had 
spent almost no time thinking about further education. In 
high school he had a strong aversion to science; after high 
school he had a mistrust of universities. “Back then,” Dono­
ghue told me, “I had no intention of going to college.”

Eventually the young Donoghue drifted back home to 
Michigan, where he decided, on a whim, to take a few 
classes at Michigan State. He liked being outdoors, and 
while traveling he’d read Darwin’s On the Origin of Spe­
cies. So he enrolled in courses in biology and plant taxon­
omy, developed a fast rapport with a geography professor, 
and found himself accompanying that professor on a field 
trip to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. There, 
in a cold forest at the top of one of the highest peaks in the 
Appalachians, he was captivated by an odd-looking shrub. 
The year was 1972. The shrub was a species of Viburnum.

Donoghue graduated from Michigan State, earned his 
PhD from Harvard in 1982, then drifted from university 
to university until finally settling at Yale in 2000. He was 
director of the Peabody Museum from 2003-2008, has been 
a Sterling professor since 2011, and is widely recognized as 
the world’s leading expert on Viburnum. As an evolutionary 
biologist, he tries to understand how physical characteris­
tics of plants evolved over time. Unfortunately, most plants 
have poor fossil records. It’s often impossible to find mil­
lion-year-old specimens, extract their DNA, and figure out 
how today’s species evolved from them. So instead, Dono­
ghue compares the DNA of modern plants, looks for simi­
larities, and tries to infer the past from the present.

Take leaf shape. Donoghue’s most recent research paper, 
titled “Leaf Form Evolution in Viburnum Parallels Vari­
ation within Individual Plants,” looks at the different leaf 
shapes of various Viburnum species and tries to explain 
why, and how, those different shapes emerged. The paper’s 
hard to follow if you’re not comfortable with words such 
as “heteroblasty,” “phylogeny,” and “phenotypic plasticity.” 
But Donoghue is happy to translate. The paper, he told me, 
is trying to answer a simple question. “Why do plants have 
so many different kinds of leaves?”

The scientist looked at me expectantly, as if he was wait­
ing for an answer. On the table, he had spread ten dark 
crimson leaves, each of them dried and pressed into dis­
play frames as if they were butterflies framed in glass. Some 
were long and smooth like the leaves of a willow, others 
were serrated like an elm’s, a few were lobed like a maple’s, 
and one was small and round like a young dogwood’s. They 
were all from species of Viburnum.

“Is there a simple answer to that question?” I finally 
asked, a little hesitantly.

“No, unfortunately there’s not,” Donoghue said, laugh­
ing. There are partial answers: theories that apply to par­
ticular species or environments. Donoghue advances one 
of these answers in his most recent paper. He hopes some­
day to find a larger Answer: one that applies to all species 
of Viburnum. Such an Answer is still far off, but maybe 
one day Donoghue and Edwards and Sinnott-Armstrong 
will find it. And once they have found it, maybe another 
Answer—one that applies to all plants, not merely Vibur­
num—will follow.

It’s as if he’s handed you a pair of del­
icate glasses, and when you put them 
on you realize that the natural world 
has always been out-of-focus.
