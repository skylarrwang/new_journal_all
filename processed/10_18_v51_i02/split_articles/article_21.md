“Pick one that doesn’t say ‘Made in China,’ 
Mariah,” my mother says, the words clipped 
as usual, but drawn out by a Georgia drawl. 
(You wouldn’t think a drawl could be clipped, 
but my mother, in this as in so many things, 
defies expectations.) She always drawls when 
Grandmama visits. Actually, it doesn’t even 
take that much. Once when we were driving 
through acres and acres of some valley some­
where in Kentucky on some black November 
night, the only light coming from the GPS, she 
turned on the radio and heard a few chords of 
country music (just the guitar, not even any­
one singing), and when she spoke next, she 
could’ve been eighteen again. She could’ve 
never left Bostwick, population 372 plus cows, 
best known for its annual cotton gin festival 
and as the town where they filmed My Cousin 
Vinny. I can’t even remember what she said. I 
just know she spoke with the full weight of the 
American South, and it echoed in the silence 
of that Kentucky road as we drove in the dark 
towards Nashville.

But today we’re not in the South. We’re in a 
TJ Maxx in suburban New Jersey, surrounded 
by discounted Michael Kors bags and overea­
ger Thanksgiving decorations. Grandmama’s 
staying with us. It’s the last time she’ll see me 
before I start college, and I’m supposed to 
choose a mug.

Most of them do, in fact, say “Made in 
China,” which my mother — who at heart is 
both an isolationist and a socialist, though with 
enough common sense to vote for Hillary — 
vetoes. Grandmama, who will later vote for 
Trump, agrees with this decision. In the end, I 
choose one with “Made in Portugal” stamped 
on the bottom in a pixelated font. It’s unusu­
ally large and shallow, so it can be used for 
late-night cereal or Easy Mac as well as coffee 
or tea. It has a bluebird printed on it in a faux 
rustic design.

Mom grabs one of the same for herself in 
an uncharacteristic show of sentimental­
ity. Grandmama pays, and as we’re walking 
through the parking lot she chastises herself 
for not getting one too. She debates going 
back, but in a show of dairy farm practicality 
and Southern unflappability, decides against 
it—she doesn’t need another mug. Therefore, 
what could have been an intergenerational 
symbol of female familial ties doesn’t quite 
materialize: the circle is broken, the edges 
can’t hold.

I take the mug with me to Yale and drink 
shitty dorm coffee out of it. It is the first piece 
of kitchenware that belongs, specifically, to 
me, which I don’t think about until junior 
year, when I move into an apartment off cam­
pus with two friends. We all pool dishes we’ve 
cribbed off our parents: Molly a frying pan, 
Harrison a bread knife. The bluebird mug 
becomes one of many, lost among the shat­
terproofs from Target and the sandy clay ones 
from my mom. I still think of the bird mug as 
mine only, though. Not in a territorial way — 
it just always has been.

But, like everything else in our kitchen, 
it’s absorbed into the communal sprawl soon 
enough. We’re bad about doing our dishes. 
Mugs are always scarce. So it’s not surprising, 
one day, when I walk past Harrison’s room and 
see the bird mug perched next to his bed. It’s 
half full of the lemon-honey-cayenne sludge 
we’ve all been drinking lately to ward off a 
cold. His bed is unmade; there’s a chalk draw­
ing of his grandmother leaning against a wall. 
I feel like I’m spying. The mug might be mine, 
but the context is not.

I don’t know why seeing the mug in Harri­
son’s room makes me sad, but it does. It makes 
me think of how Harrison doesn’t know the 
history of the mug and Mom and Grandmama 
don’t know the history of Harrison, and I could 
try and explain each to the other, but at a cer­
tain point none of it would matter because 
I’m past the point where anyone can know 
my whole life story. I think about the life I’m 
living now — Yale and Connecticut and art 
major roommates and drinking until I throw 
up on weekends and writing stories about sec­
ular angels in classes taught by famous nov­
elists — and how it isn’t anything (anything!) 
my grandmother would recognize. My mom 
can imagine it, but that’s all: she can imagine. 
Everything is fragmented. Nothing is whole.

Here’s a way to drive yourself crazy: if your 
middle school self had braces and zits and an 
anime phase, but none of your college friends 
were around to see it, does it make a sound? 
Let’s try another one. If I met my grandmother 
when she was my age, a history major at the 
University of Georgia who transferred after she 
found the Baptist college too morally loose for 
her tastes (did she prefer sin out in the open, 
where she could judge it? I guess that’s bet­
