ter than hypocrisy), would we have hated each 
other? Surely we couldn’t have been friends. 
Or maybe this is my own failure of imagina­
tion: I cannot construct for myself any version 
of Grandmama’s inner life. If I try (and I admit, 
I rarely try) I end up banging my head against a 
metaphorical wall—one somehow shaped like 
both a Bible and a piece of fried cube steak.

And then what about my mom? If I try to 
write about her she’ll overwhelm this essay. If I 
try to write about her, then I’ll be writing about 
everything, because everything I write is at least 
a little bit about her, because her young adult­
hood should have looked a lot more like mine 
and her life is the story of the many reasons 
why it didn’t. Most of the reasons can be traced 
to growing up in a small town before the Inter­
net. What prevented her from leaving Geor­
gia more intentionally, from studying English 
or film or spending her twenties meandering 
through a career without a husband or kids, 
was not so much any particular hardship as the 
stunted imagination that flourishes in small 
towns like Bostwick. I wonder if she ever uses 
her bluebird mug. If she does, I haven’t seen it.

I think about who I would have been if 
my parents had stayed in rural Georgia. We 
could’ve lived down the road from the white 
farmhouse where my mother and several gen­
erations before her grew up. I could’ve grown 
up there too: playing with the feral cats in the 
disused milking barn, chasing lizards and kill­
ing fire ants, picking figs off Grandmama’s 
monstrous fig tree and reading in the shadow 
of the ruined grain silo. I don’t recognize this 
other Mariah. (At the very least, she bleaches 
her hair). I wonder if she would have ended up 
where and who I am all the same, or if — as I 
suspect — she’s another fragment, the product 
of a speciation event that took place long before 
I was born, a case of evolution most divergent. 
Maybe she’d have a whole flock of bird mugs 
and a sign in her room that says ‘Live Love 
Laugh.’ Or maybe I’m being an elitist prick.

I just think we’re all split at some kind of
