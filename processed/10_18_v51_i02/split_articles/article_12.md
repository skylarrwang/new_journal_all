Every Sunday morning around 6:00 a.m., the inte­
rior of College Street Music Hall undergoes a subtle 
metamorphosis. The bar is shuttered, coffee urns appear 
in the front lobby, and rows of chairs replace the Satur­
day-night concert detritus strewn about the 2,000-person 
venue. The concert lights and an earplug dispenser stay in 
place. Church starts at 8:30.

As congregants meander into the building under a 
marquee advertising this season’s concert lineup, which 
features Dirty Heads and Lil Yachty, volunteers clad in 
black t-shirts distribute grins, information cards, and 
“good-morning”s. Soaring vocals fight their way through 
the bellowing synth and guitar and into the lobby:
Who the Son sets free, oh!
Is free indeed—
I’m a child of God,
Yes I am!

Vox Church, known until June as City Church, holds 
three services every Sunday morning. In 2011, Chris­
tian-rocker-turned-pastor Justin Kendrick started the min­
istry out of Toad’s Place. The non-denominational, born-
again congregation has since outgrown Toads’ 750-person 
space and spread beyond New Haven, with a campus 
down the coast in Bridgeport and another set to open in 
Stamford in 2019. Vox has also floated up the Connecticut 
River into North Haven, Middletown, and Hartford, and 
just crossed state lines this October into Massachusetts—a 
state where less than one in four people attend religious 
services weekly, according to Pew’s most recent Religious 
Landscape Study.

Connecticut isn’t much more pious; Pew ranks it as the 
forty-sixth most religious state, ahead of Vermont, Maine, 
New Hampshire, and Massachusetts. Despite these statis­
tics, the landing page on Vox’s website trumpets a mission 
“to see New England become the most spiritually vibrant 
place on Earth.” The church’s success is especially sur­
prising given the recent drop in the number of born-again 
and evangelical Christians, which fell from 26 percent 
of the nation’s population in 2007 to 17 percent in 2016. 
Only a tenth of evangelicals are under 30. Vox seems to 
buck these trends, among others. As Kendrick quipped in 
a sermon this summer, “This ain’t the church Grandma 
went to.”

The sermons at Vox begin after a thirty-minute musi­
cal performance by the church’s “worship team,” often 
led by Justin’s wife, Chrisy. They belt out pop-hymns 
in front of LED rectangles. Yellow and fuchsia concert 
lights sweep over the crowd, illuminating a diverse array 
of congregants, some with hands raised in praise, oth­
ers with heads bowed in worship, and at least one infant 
wearing noise-cancelling headphones. As the band ends 
on a crescendo, Kendrick, his dark hair and five o’clock 
shadow visible from the back of the hall, rocks onstage in 
time with the guitar. He greets the assembled with a voice 
at least as loud as the band he’s replacing: “Welcome to 
church!” It’s when he’s behind the microphone that I wish 
I’d grabbed earplugs on the way in.

Kendrick reminds everyone that Vox is “one church in 
five locations.” His sermon is live-streamed to the church’s 
offshoots. It’s also posted to the Vox website, with a dub­
step-drop intro slapped onto the beginning, so viewers can 
attend church wherever there’s WiFi. The digital revolu­
tion isn’t only for the ministry: Churchgoers with glowing 
phones aren’t texting during Kendrick’s sermon—they’re 
following his scripture references with an online Bible.

The congregation, which numbers 2,000 each week 
across the church’s campuses, matches Kendrick’s energy. 
Applause erupts almost a dozen times a sermon, and con­
