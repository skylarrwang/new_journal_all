 SUPERSTAR
cert-worthy woooos are more common than you’d think. 
Vox encourages its parishioners to take notes, which is 
challenging because Kendrick’s pace is quick: he zings 
from childhood stories to Biblical exegesis to TED Talk–
style life lessons. Once or twice a sermon, he stops to 
announce, “If you’re taking notes today, you can write this 
down,” before presenting some of the day’s distilled wis­
dom. One Sunday in September, Kendrick used a blow­
torch, Drano, a straitjacket, and a tennis ball as part of an 
extended vulnerability metaphor that brought the house 
down. Minutes later, the woman next to me was moved to 
tears by the pastor’s story about apologizing to his eleven-
year-old son.


Tim Gnaneswaran, Connections Director for Vox’s 
New Haven Campus, says he knows why the services are 
so powerful. “The Holy Spirit,” he tells me. “[The Gospel] 
is the book we’re sharing, but the Holy Spirit is moving in 
our services, and that’s what makes them dynamic.”


Raquel Sequeira, a Yale sophomore and one of several 
Yale students who regularly attend Vox, wasn’t sure about 
the church’s “rock-and-roll” vibe at first. But alongside 
the theatrics she found a pastor who takes the Bible seri­
ously—often delving into the original Greek—without 
losing sight of personal spiritual experience. The flashy 
style mattered to her less than the biblical content. “What 
ended up being true was something [Kendrick] says a lot: 
‘Connecting with God is more than your brain, more than 
your mind, more than your emotions.’” For Sequeira, the 
central question of a religious space is, “Do I feel like the 
Holy Spirit is here?” She says the answer at Vox is yes. 
Plus, unlike other churches in the area, Vox doesn’t feel 
“tailored to students.”


Sequeira’s only hesitation is that among the bells and 
whistles and blowtorches, the church can come off as 
“appearance-focused,” especially compared to the Angli­
can parish where she was raised. When the pastor is in 
ripped jeans and the church is in a concert hall, the 
branding is so pointed, Sequiera thinks, that it might 
appear disingenuous.


Timothy White, a junior, went so far as to call Vox’s 
marketing tactics “somewhat nefarious.” White, who is 
gay and grew up as the son of an Evangelical minister, told 
me that a lack of clarity and inconsistency between mar­
keting and doctrine can make parishioners feel excluded 
from a community that otherwise espouses, according to 
their website, “respect and Christian love.” At Vox, he 
said, “They present an image of diversity, while excluding 
people under wraps.” White said the church isn’t up-front 
about its belief, lifted from Corinthians I and common 
among evangelicals, that sex is a spiritual experience only 
appropriate in a marriage between a man and a woman. 
Since White stopped attending in 2016, Vox has held a 
sermon on sexuality (also featuring a blowtorch) that clar­
ified its adherence to that interpretation of Corinthians.


The name “Vox” also arrived after White left, and is 
part of a push to showcase the church’s self-proclaimed 
uniqueness. “Although the name City Church carries so 
much meaning for us,” explained Kendrick in a video 
announcement of the name change on the church’s You­
Tube channel, “it’s also a name used by many churches 
across the country.” Vox has a more distinct flavor. Mean­
ing “voice” in Latin, the name is inspired by John 5:25, 
which Kendrick quotes later in the same video: “Truly I 
say to you, an hour is coming and is now here, when the 
dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those 
who hear”—with or without earplugs, one assumes—“will 
live.”
