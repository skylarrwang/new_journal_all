ART OF THE STATE
overshadows much of the discourse around Palestine 
in the U.S. The U.S. was the first country to recognize 
Israel in 1948, and has long been Israel’s largest trading 
partner and political ally. Most Americans learn about 
Palestinians through politicians like Newt Gingrich, 
who has called the Palestinians an “invented people,” or 
Donald Trump, who recently tweeted that Palestinians 
do not “appreciate or respect” the U.S. and are unwill­
ing to talk peace. Far more Americans sympathize more 
with Israel (54 percent) than with the Palestinians (14 
percent) in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, according to 
a 2016 Pew Research Center Foreign Policy study—in 
contrast with global public opinion, which is generally 
more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. In this polar­
ized political climate, Saleh feels that art humanizes 
Palestinians, providing an entry point into dialogue in a 
way that no political negotiations can.


Saleh was born in El Bireh, a Palestinian city about 
ten miles north of Jerusalem in the central West Bank 
— a land east of Israel that today most of the interna­
tional community considers to be illegally occupied Pal­
estinian territory. His family’s story is “like the story of 
millions of Palestinians,” he said. “They were refugees 
in 1948. Their families lost everything. They had to pick 
up the pieces—they had to struggle.”


Saleh came to the U.S. to finish his high school 
diploma in 1969, when he was seventeen. He received a 
Bachelor’s degree from Oberlin College and an M.B.A. 
from the University of Connecticut, and has lived in the 
United States ever since, working in human resources 
for over forty years. He opened the museum on the 
ground floor of an office building he owns on a quiet 
stretch of the Litchfield Turnpike. Renovations began in 
September of 2017, and the museum opened less than a 
year later, in April of 2018.


According to Saleh, about half of the museum’s visi­
tors are of Palestinian descent, often hailing from Bos­
ton, Philadelphia, and New York. In addition to show­
casing Palestinian art, the museum also hosts cultural 
events. In recent months, it has hosted a traditional 
Palestinian storyteller, an Arab-Israeli member of the 
Knesset (Israel’s parliament), and a comedy show with 
a Palestinian-American comedian that drew a crowd of 
W
oodbridge, Connecticut, a sleepy suburb 
fifteen minutes northwest of downtown New 
Haven, is an unlikely home for Palestine Museum 
U.S.—the first and only museum in the Americas ded­
icated solely to Palestinian history, culture, and art. 
Woodbridge has a sizable Jewish population: two Jew­
ish community centers and three synagogues flank the 
museum. It’s exactly the kind of place where one might 
expect a museum dedicated to Palestine to raise more 
than a few eyebrows.


Faisal Saleh, the Palestinian businessman who 
founded the museum last spring, and now serves as its 
director, claims no political agenda. He said he hopes 
to use the museum to showcase the artistic excellence 
of Palestinians, providing visitors with a glimpse of what 
Palestinians are like “outside of all the mumble jumble 
of the political haranguing and arguments.”


This “mumble jumble”—which, this past summer, 
included border protests and shootings in Gaza, paired 
with the Trump administration’s divisive decision to 
move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem—

over a hundred people.


I arrived for a tour on a Sunday afternoon. A floor-to-
ceiling mural on the left wall of the reception area fea­
tured the pensive face of a young white woman, super­
imposed over a scene of the young woman standing in 
front of an armed bulldozer. Chris, a volunteer, told me 
that the mural was painted in tribute to Rachel Corrie, 
an American pro-Palestine activist killed by an Israeli 
bulldozer in Gaza in 2003. An aerial photograph of 
Jerusalem extended across the wall opposite the mural, 
and a table lined with books related to Palestine stood 
in between.


Dina Omar, an Anthropology graduate student at Yale 
and museum volunteer, approached and introduced her­
self. Omar is Palestinian; her family hails from Ramoun, 
a small village in the West Bank. She led me from the 
first room, the reception area, into a larger gallery, filled 
with black-and-white photographs on three walls. A mid­
dle-aged man with white hair and glasses was nailing 
down some of the photographs whose edges had curled 
up. (“It’s the weather,” he said.) He came over and intro­
duced himself as Faisal.


Saleh and Omar took me on a tour of the four-thou­
sand-square-foot museum, which consists of several 
galleries and a large event space, all on the ground 
floor of the building. Saleh began with the collection 
of pre-1948 photographs of Palestine, which he picked 
out himself. “We wanted to show what Palestine was 
like in the nineteen-hundreds, that there was a thriving 
community of Palestinians,” he said. A few photographs 
depict Palestinian resistance against British rule and 
Zionist emigration to Palestine. Others present scenes 
of everyday life: a cotton market in Jerusalem, a class 
picture of students at a girls’ school. 


Saleh led me to a case containing an old passport 
labeled “The State of Palestine” and a small business 
ledger. These documents belong to Saleh’s father, who 
owned a business in Palestine that grew and exported 
fruit. The staple holding the documents together, Saleh 
proudly told me, had survived since 1946.


Most of the artists on display are from the West Bank 
or Gaza—some still live there, while others live and 
work abroad. One objective of the museum is to provide 
a market for Palestinian art. “Art galleries in Palestine 
caught wind of this gallery and were hungry to show in 
the U.S.,” Saleh said. The Palestine Museum invites 
proposals for exhibition from Palestinian artists on its 
website. Saleh is open to featuring artists working in a 
variety of media. 


Maisarah Baroud, an artist from Gaza, draws heavily 
on mystical imagery in haunting black-and-white ink 
drawings. His piece “Dialogue” depicts hollowed-out, 
skeletal bodies, which, Omar explained, represent the
