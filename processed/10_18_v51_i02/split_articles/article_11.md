This fall, Adam Moftah’s expenses added up 
quickly. He spent $15 Xeroxing old graphic 
designs to make new compositions for a project. Then, 
after he turned the project in, he learned from his pro­
fessor that he’d approached the assignment incorrectly, 
and would have to start anew. Meanwhile, he had two 
credit card bills due soon — nearly $200 for books, 
school supplies, and other expenses from the start of 
the semester. 

For Moftah, a senior from New York City, majoring 
in art hasn’t come cheap. He estimates he has spent at 
least $1,000 over the past four years on materials and 
printing fees. One course cost him $650 alone. One 
of the main expenses art students face is paying for 
materials, which, unlike textbooks, cannot be rented 
or downloaded as a PDF online. For students who are 
financially secure, then, taking an art class may require 
only shelling out a couple hundred dollars more. But 
for students who, like Moftah, receive nearly full finan­
cial aid, the extra financial burden can mean the differ­
ence between paying bills on time and taking on debt.

Recently, Moftah has started combining coding and 
art to explore virtual reality. Currently, although he 
is an undergraduate, he works as a graduate fellow at 
the Center for Collaborative Arts and Media (CCAM). 
This past August, Moftah’s work with virtual reality was 
exhibited in a virtual gallery maze at the CCAM called 
“Labyrinths.” He hopes to graduate with a job at an 
advertising or marketing firm, or at an art studio.

But at Yale, financial strain has affected Moftah’s cre­
ativity, he says. In trying to buy the cheapest materials 
and use as little as possible, Moftah says, you’re “basi­
cally reducing your experimental ambitions.” Now, 
he’s starting to take more digital video courses instead 
of graphic design courses because digital courses don’t 
charge additional fees to students. 

The Yale School of Art offers classes to both under­
graduates and Masters of Fine Arts graduate students. 
At the undergraduate level, courses typically require 
about $150 in course fees, paid directly to professors 
to cover communal supplies, visits from guest speakers, 
and transportation costs for field trips. These fees don’t 
include the cost of textbooks or materials fees.

Art students pay course fees once they turn in their 
schedules, weeks after paying tuition. As a result, these 
fees are not calculated in students’ cost of attendance, 
or in financial aid scholarships. To help art students 
finance summer opportunities abroad or at work, the 
School of Art offers the Robert Reed Scholarship Fund, 
but it does not provide scholarships to cover costs 
incurred during the academic year.

Director of Undergraduate Studies in Art Lisa 
Kereszi says that over the past few years, art students 
have frequently come to her for help with course fees 
–– so often that Assistant Dean for the Arts Kate Krier 
decided to buy cameras for students to borrow from the 
Cushing/Whitney Medical Library Circulation Desk, 
near the School of Art. Previously, the desk had only 
offered help with laptops. 

Still, Kereszi admits, “I can do very little, honestly. 
And I don’t know if my students now feel resentful.” 
When a student comes to Kereszi, she suggests that 
they ask their head of college or financial aid officer if 
a portion of their financial aid can be applied directly 
to course fees. 

This year, Moftah received $600 in addition to 
the $60,887 he typically receives in his financial aid 
package. The grant was labeled “Supplemental Allow­
ance,” funds Yale projected he would need for “senior 
expenses.” In years past, with no additional funding, 
Moftah had resorted to working up to three campus 
jobs during the semester ranging from shelving books 
in Sterling Memorial Library to modeling nude for 
other art classes.

Sometimes, professors try to help. Hazal Özgür is a 
junior art major from Turkey. Özgür says that an art 
professor once offered to pay for her materials, but she 
didn’t take him up on it. “I was like, ‘Nah, I can do this, 
don’t worry.’ Because I’ve been doing this anyway, $50 
isn’t going to solve my problems.” While Özgür praised 
her professor’s kindness, she does not feel comfortable 
accepting money from faculty. “It’s a sticky situation to 
be in,” she said.

As a professor, Kereszi typically uses course fees to 
fund field trips to museums and host guest critics or 
lecturers. In early October, Kereszi took two of her 
classes to New York City and used the course fees to 
pay for her students’ train tickets, metro cards, and 
museum tickets. While she realizes that these fees are 
an extra burden on students — Kereszi was a low-in­
come art major herself — she says that trips like these 
are necessary for a quality art education. 

Beyond course fees, there are still more hurdles. Tra­
ditionally, juniors who are art majors have worked in 
studio spaces in the sculpture building, but due to the 
recent growth in the number of art majors, juniors were 
not offered studios this year. While some of her wealth­
ier friends rented spaces in New Haven, which can cost 
$600 each month, Özgür didn’t have the money to do 
so. Working in her apartment isn’t an option for Özgür; 
it’s small enough to trap toxic paint fumes. For now, 
she can’t afford to buy canvases, so she can’t tackle her 
artistic specialty — large scale paintings. In fact, Özgür 
is currently working on only one piece, since she lacks 
the money to do more.


 “No one really talks about these issues in the 
School of Art, and in this major in general,” she said. 
“It’s sort of like an unspoken thing. Because [major­
ing in art] implies that you know what you’re getting 
yourself into. It’s like, ‘We’re not forcing you to do this, 
you’re choosing this for yourself.’” 

Kerezsi acknowledges that this dynamic is an issue. 
“I know how hard it is to go to a wealthy school and be 
one of the students who’s a ‘scholarship kid,’” Kerezsi 
says. “It’s really important to me that one of the many 
ways Yale is diverse is class.”

Meanwhile, Moftah says that being asked to re-do 
his graphic design project was an informative experi­
ence. Now, when he works on projects, he is forced to 
account for the financial uncertainty that accompanies 
doing art at Yale and contend with his steep printing 
costs. Creating art, for him, is no longer exploratory. 
“There’s pressure to be doing well. Part of doing well is 
figuring out printing, and part of doing that is having a 
lot of money to spend on printing,” he said. “I need to 
figure this out sooner. I can’t be as experimental; I have 
to be more deliberate.”
