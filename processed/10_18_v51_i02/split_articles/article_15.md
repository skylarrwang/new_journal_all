The Palestine Museum, nestled in Woodbridge, Connecticut, stands as a testament to the resilience of Palestinian culture and the power of art to transcend conflict.  Founded by businessman Bashar Saleh, the museum showcases a diverse collection of artwork, offering a poignant reflection on Palestinian experiences, from the faded dreams of the “Oslo generation” to the constraints of life under occupation and in the diaspora.


One striking exhibit features the expressionist paintings of Malak Mattar, an eighteen-year-old artist from Gaza, whose work vividly portrays the claustrophobia and isolation inherent in life under occupation.  The museum also displays artwork created by Gaza children who survived the 2008-2009 Gaza War, providing a stark depiction of the violence they endured.  This exhibit, previously cancelled in Oakland due to pro-Israel opposition, stands as a symbol of the museum's commitment to showcasing unfiltered Palestinian narratives.


Saleh's vision extends beyond the current Woodbridge location. He hopes to establish branches in major U.S. cities, despite the anticipated opposition from those who oppose a Palestinian presence in those cities.  The museum’s success, however, is not solely attributed to Saleh's financial resources and business acumen, but also to strong community ties.  The museum has even hosted a Rosh Hashanah service, highlighting the interfaith collaboration and community building that the museum facilitates.


Saleh believes that by showcasing the humanity of the Palestinian people, the museum can challenge the injustices of policies like the defunding of UNRWA, particularly when contrasted with the substantial U.S. aid to Israel.  For Saleh, demonstrating the shared humanity between Palestinians and others is a key step towards fostering understanding and progress.
