“A lot of the time,” the female student 
said, “students are being policed because 
they’re presumed to be not from Yale be­
cause they’re Black, and New Haven is 
Black. That’s the assumption.”
graduate students are essential. “During orientation, 
I remember a police officer saying, ‘Don’t go past this 
street,’ or ‘Stay in this area on campus,’ or ‘These parts 
of town might be dangerous,’” she recalled. “That 
trickles down through the graduate population so that 
a lot of times, when Black students come on campus, 
people assume that we are not meant to be there.”
“There are students on campus who are really dep­
utized to police people of color in the area,” she said, 
“and, moreover, who are emboldened and empow­
ered to weaponize the police against students of color 
who they feel don’t belong.”


For some students, calling the police doesn’t feel 
like a viable option. On a Wednesday in October 
2016, during the fall semester of her senior year, 
Chelsey Clark, who graduated from Yale College 
in 2017, went out dancing with two friends at an 
off-campus venue that was reserved for Yale students. 
Clark and both friends identify as Black women. 
When they gathered by the back staircase inside the 
venue, a bouncer approached them and asked them 
to move in what Clark described as a “forceful” tone. 
The three students cleared from the staircase area. 
Then, without warning, the bouncer threw one of 
Clark’s friends to the ground. When Clark protested, 
he slammed her to the floor, too. He seized the friend 
on the ground by the neck and clutched Clark by the 
wrist, and dragged the two of them across the dance 
floor, pulling them outside. The third friend followed 
“screaming,” Clark recalled. As the bouncer dragged 
her out, Clark’s phone and student ID fell out of her 
hand. The sea of dancing people parted to make way, 
many of them watching. No one intervened.
Outside, Clark was shaken but clear-headed, run­
ning on adrenaline. She borrowed someone’s phone 
and called the police to report the altercation. “The 
optic of two Black women being dragged out of a party, 
that really bothered me deep down,” she said. “I know 
that a lot of people must have seen that and thought 
that we were being belligerent and maybe aggres­
sive. And that that’s why we were being removed and 
that the action was justified. And that really, really 
ate at me for a really long time.” Clark called the 
police with these thoughts pulsing through her mind. 
She remembers thinking, “I need proof that I didn’t 
responded to multiple requests for comment.
“A lot of the times,” the female student said, “stu­
dents are being policed because they’re presumed 
to be not from Yale because they’re Black, and New 
Haven is Black. That’s the assumption.”


In the immediate aftermath of Braasch’s call to the 
police in May, a group of graduate students gathered 
to draft an open letter to the Yale administration. The 
letter called for specific reforms towards a more equi­
table campus for Black members of the community, 
and ultimately accumulated about 670 signatures, 
according to one of the letter’s authors. Among other 
requests, the letter asked for the founding of a Title VI 
office dedicated to eliminating racial discrimination 
on campus in compliance with Title VI of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964. Yale currently has a Title IX office 
devoted to fighting sex and gender discrimination on 
campus, but the university’s resources for community 
members who face racism are decentralized across 
various departments and schools. The administration 
officially encourages students who have experienced 
racial discrimination to either confide in their resi­
dential college dean or dean’s designee, or else to go 
to the Office of Equal Opportunity, which handles 
all kinds of discrimination. On October 9, President 
Salovey sent out a university-wide email introduc­
ing a new website, “Belonging at Yale,” a guide of 
resources for students who have faced harassment and 
discrimination. A few days later, on October 11, Goff-
Crews, the Secretary and Vice-President for Student 
Life, said in a statement to the Yale Daily News that 
the university did not plan to implement a Title VI 
office, but was reviewing the efficacy of the resources 
it already offers.
The students’ open letter also called for a system in 
which Yale Police Officers would respond to non-vi­
olent calls without carrying firearms. When asked 
about this suggestion, Higgins responded, “Highly 
trained, empathetic, armed officers keep everyone 
safe.”
Alexia Williams, a Yale graduate student in the 
African-American Studies and American Studies 
departments who co-authored the open letter, said 
she is concerned about how the YPD’s presence alters 
students’ perceptions of other New Haven residents. 
“I feel that they promote defensiveness between Yale 
students and the New Haven community,” she said.
Williams, along with other graduate and under­
graduate students, attended meetings with admin­
istrators throughout the summer to address some of 
the concerns expressed in the letter. She said the 
administration was largely receptive to listen to stu­
dents’ ideas. In an email to the University in August, 
President Peter Salovey announced that all teaching 
fellows and new graduate students would undergo 
mandatory anti-bias and inclusivity trainings this fall, 
honoring a request that the letter expressed.
For Williams, these required training sessions for

deserve for this to happen to me, and I need people to 
know that this was not fair.”
Three NHPD officers responded to Clark’s call; 
two of them exited the car to speak with Clark and 
the friends she had been with. One of the officers 
was white, and the other was Black. The officers 
responded with “dismissive” words and body language 
and declined to take statements from two witnesses 
who offered to speak to them, Clark said. At one 
point, she asked the officers why they weren’t taking 
the incident seriously. “We were just assaulted,” she 
told them.
“You were not assaulted,” she recalls the white offi­
cer responding.
After that, Clark left, her statement incomplete. 
The police contacted her the next morning in order 
to follow up; she declined to saywhether she pressed 
charges against the bouncer. But the conversation 
with the police officers that night was “the worst part” 
of what happened, Clark said. Clark has long, curly 
hair; when we spoke over Skype, she wore a sweatshirt 
from Princeton University, where she’s now pursing a 
doctorate in psychology. The NHPD did not respond 
to a request for comment.
Clark said she’d always thought of police officers as 
people who would have her back when she needed it. 
But after the altercation with the bouncer, “that just 
totally went away,” she said, “I don’t even want to use 
that resource anymore. And that’s really dangerous, 
because what if something else happens and I don’t 
feel comfortable calling the cops?”
In the months after the violent encounter with 
the bouncer and subsequent conversation with the 
police, Clark said she barely left her apartment out­
side of attending classes. She withdrew from friends 
and had some difficulty focusing on academics. “I 
never would have spoken about this as a student,” 
Clark says. “It’s only now that I’m gone that I’m like, 
‘I don’t really care that much anymore.’ But while I 
was there, the people I went to were SHARE [Yale’s 
Sexual Harrassment and Assault Response & Educa­
tion Center], which is confidential, and the dean of 
my cultural center, and I told her, ‘You can’t tell any­
one, this cannot get out.’ So I think that we just need 
to think about the fact that this could be happening to 
students all the time, and we have no idea.”


Every August, first-year undergraduates, so new to 
Yale they’re still wearing their IDs around their necks, 
convene in Woolsey Hall for a mandatory talk on pub­
lic safety. In past years, they watched a grainy video 
that followed “Lance,” a blonde, white male student 
who neglects to use a U-lock to secure his bicycle 
and lets slip to a man in baggy jeans and a bandana 
that he only carries hundred-dollar bills. “Please 
take a moment to identify with Lance,” the narrator 
instructed viewers at the beginning. All of the actors 
shown in the video are white.
This year, in the aftermath of the HGS scandal, the

It is the first day of autumn. I walk outside, and all the neon in the shops
along York Street has been lit up. It is 6 PM, but the church bells are ringing.
In childhood I lived near a church. I never saw it, but every day I heard the bells
striking the hour at noon and 6 PM. Some days I was inside, the windows shut,
and the bells were muffled, or I missed them, and when I look at the clock
and it was 2 PM, or 7 PM, the sun setting through the trees in the backyard
and making it hard to look out the window over the sink as I washed the dishes,
time felt unreal. In the summer the sun would not set until late, and then when I 
looked at the clock the day was already over. Today the leaves are still green but already
it is cold, alread I picture the end of the season: the limbs of the trees, 
Thanksgiving, Christmas, the warmth of the bed in the morning. Cocooned in the
sheets, waking to my mother turning on the lamp on my desk, its light a soft
halo in the early dark. That was my childhood with the church bells. Someone
on a street corner singing Jacques Brel—


Ne me quitte pas

Il faut oublier

Tout peut s’oublier

Qui s’enfuit déjà—




each word bleeding into the next
like rain streaming down a windowpane. It is the first day of autumn and I am
standing in the middle of York Street unable to move. All of that neon bright in the
half-dark, bright and sad. The bells have stopped. In the shop windows people with
slack faces open their mouths and laugh. Where do we go now? Where do we all go
now?
