Yale cell biology professor Yongli Zhang 
conducts his research using tiny tweezers. These 
aren’t tweezers you’d find hanging in the CVS beauty 
section. They’re far too small to pluck your eyebrows: 
about one hundred of them, bunched up, are as thick 
as a single human hair. With the aid of a microscope, 
you’d see that the tweezers are used to manipulate tiny 
glass beads. Together, one or two beads work to trap 
and apply force onto a single molecule. Using these 
optical tweezers, Zhang, who joined Yale’s faculty in 
2009, studies protein molecules called SNARE com­
plexes, which are key to understanding serious diseases 
such as epilepsy. 

Zhang’s potentially groundbreaking research relies 
on a steady stream of funding, and graduate students 
who study both biology and physics. That’s where the 
Raymond and Beverly Sackler Institute of Biological, 
Engineering, and Physical Sciences comes in.

Founded in 2008 to strengthen collaboration be­
tween biology, physics, and engineering researchers at 
Yale, the Sackler Institute currently facilitates research 
by Zhang and 50 other faculty members. Donations 
from the Sackler family fund a wide range of research 
at Yale, Tufts, Harvard, and Princeton. The family has 
also endowed Yale’s David A. Sackler Professorship of 
Pharmacology with $3 billion. This post is currently 
held by Professor Mark Lemmon at the Yale Cancer 
Biology Institute. A spokesperson for the Sackler Foun­
dation declined to comment on how much money 
Yale receives each year, as did the Yale Development 
Office.

But the Sacklers’ $13 billion fortune comes at a cost: 
their company, Purdue Pharma, a massive pharma­
ceutical conglomerate and the creator of OxyContin, 
has been blamed by activists, government officials, 
and medical experts for fueling the opioid crisis raging 
across America. 

In 1952, Arthur, Mortimer, and Raymond Sackler 
bought Purdue Frederick, a small private medical com­
pany. Together, the three brothers from Brooklyn built 
a pharmaceutical empire out of circular white pills no

Science research at Yale is funded by the family responsible for the opioid crisis. Faculty mem­
bers don’t seem to care.

larger than the tip of an index finger. OxyContin comes 
in doses of 10, 80, or 160 milligrams and, unlike oth­
er prescription painkillers, has a patented slow-release 
technology that allows patients to take only two doses 
every twenty-four hours. The main ingredient of this 
‘miracle drug’ is oxycodone, a close cousin of heroin. 
When OxyContin appeared on pharmacy shelves in 
1995, doctors generally believed that opioids only be­
longed in hospice care centers. Terminally ill patients 
were frequently prescribed opioids like morphine, be­
cause at that point in their illnesses, addiction was no 
longer a concern. The Sacklers worked tirelessly to 
overturn these perceptions, according to an exposé by 
Patrick Radden Keefe published in The New Yorker in 
2017.

Purdue’s marketing campaign was a massive opera­
tion. The company employed over 1,000 sales repre­
sentatives armed with graphs and statistics designed 



to convince doctors that opioids were a casual and 
safe solution to even minor arthritic pain and muscle 
strains. Representatives offered smiling OxyContin pill 
plushies colored white, pink, and blue. There were 
OxyContin tote bags, baseball caps, picture books, and 
clocks. In 1997, Arthur Sackler was posthumously in­
ducted into the Medical Advertising Hall of Fame.
 “The initial marketing of OxyContin was very ag­
gressive,” said Dr. Lynn Madden, the CEO and Direc­
tor of the APT Foundation, which provides free walk-in 
addiction treatment to New Haven residents. “Yes, I do 
think that the marketing campaign did result in lots of 
powerful medication being prescribed and ultimately 
being abused.”

When asked to comment on their ties to the opioid 
crisis, representatives of Purdue Pharma responded 
with the following statement: “Since its approval, Oxy­
Contin has been and continues to be appropriately pre­
scribed by doctors to bring needed relief to thousands 
suffering from severe pain, including those with cancer 
and terminal illnesses.” Purdue also stressed in its state­
ment that the company has been developing programs 
to create “meaningful solutions to help stem the tide 
of opioid-related overdose deaths,” such as providing 
funds for state prescription drug monitoring programs 
and spearheading educational initiatives about the 
dangers of opioids for teenagers. 

According to Radden Keefe, Purdue Pharma paid off 
respected scientific authorities to distort the addictive 
effects of OxyContin. Russell Portenoy, the pain spe­
cialist at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
in New York, claimed that opioids should be destigma­
tized and used as an effective, safe painkiller with few 
side effects. He received regular payments from Pur­
due Pharma. Dr. Curtis Wright of the Food and Drug 
Administration approved an insert in each OxyContin 
bottle that reassured users that the drug was safer than 
rival painkillers due to the delayed-absorption mech­
anism. He quit the FDA and landed a job at Purdue 
Pharma two years later. Scientific research, in this case, 
was crudely manhandled for personal profit at the ex­
pense of the common good.

In 2007, Purdue Pharma pled guilty in federal court 
to accusations of deliberate misadvertisement, and 
agreed to pay $600 million in fines. This, however, was 
just a sliver of the $13 billion that Purdue earned by 
selling OxyContin.



The name “Raymond and Beverly Sackler Institute” 
calls to mind high, austere stone walls and gold-em­
blazoned plates. But no such building exists on Yale’s 
campus. Instead, the Sackler Institute is a forum for 
researchers. During monthly lunch discussions in lec­
ture halls on Science Hill, Sackler-affiliated professors 
share their latest research, and participants from a vari­
ety of scientific backgrounds meet and chat with their 
colleagues. Neuroscience Professor Alex Kwan, whose 
lab is located at Yale’s medical campus, said that the 
Institute has helped him solidify his connections with 
associates a fifteen-minute walk away at the main cam­
pus.

Additionally, the Sackler Institute’s partnership 
with Yale’s Integrated Graduate Program in Physical 
and Engineering Biology, or PEB, channels graduate 
students into research positions with Sackler faculty 
and connects them to various interdisciplinary lecture 
courses. Sackler professors, in turn, can recruit from a 
pool of talented graduate students across multiple dis­
ciplines.

“Interdisciplinary studies can really drive a field for­



 18
ward rather than just focusing on one field,” said Mil­
ind Singh, a PEB graduate student studying glycolysis, 
the process by which cells convert sugar into energy. 
“Just expanding on one field alone probably won’t re­
sult in many advances.”

Members of the Sackler Institute enjoy access to an­
nual seed grants of $50,000, enough to either start a 
lab or take on a risky new research venture, according 
to Kwan.

All five Sackler-affiliated professors I interviewed 
expressed strong enthusiasm for the Sackler Institute. 
When asked about the controversial Sackler name, 
Zhang said that the opioid epidemic has never come 
up during the weekly discussions, and that he had only 
“heard about it recently, maybe in a conversation.”

I asked Professor Scott Holley, head of a biology lab 
conducting research on the spinal column, whether he 
had any ethical qualms about the origins of the Sackler 
Institute’s funds.
“Not necessarily,” said Holley. “We are aware of it, 
but it’s like the Rockefellers and Carnegies and how 
they got their money. The world is not black and white. 
I think it’s a good thing that they are supporting scientif­
ic research and that’s something that benefits society.” 

Singh, the PEB student, said he had never heard 
about the Sacklers’ connection to the opioid crisis pri­
or to our conversation. He said that if he had a position 
of authority in the Sackler Institute, he would focus on 
the future and the current scientific research conduct­
ed by Sackler-affiliated professors. “There’s always a 
possibility that if the company really tries to improve… 
it’s always possible to move on,” he said.



Some people, however, find it difficult to move on. 
Matthew Jeffrey Abrams, who received a Ph.D in His­
tory of Art from Yale in 2017, led a double life. He spent 
his teenage years in the suburbs shooting Ketamine 
and OxyContin, and once smuggled drugs across the 
Mexican border. By 19, he had reclaimed sobriety and 
reentered school; he went on to receive a PhD at Yale. 
Now, Abrams is a writer and art historian living in New 
York City. In a personal essay published in The Guard­
ian this May, he wrote, “Only last week, during a visit 
to my alma mater, did I begin to understand the role 
that Yale played in my own addiction.”

In the essay, Abrams wrote, he saw the traces of ad­
diction creeping onto Yale’s campus. From Skull & 
Bones, whose founder, William Russell, had familial 
ties to the Indo-Chinese opium trade, to Yale’s sprawl­
ing medical campus, whose Sackler Institute lives on a 
yearly injection of Purdue money, Yale’s connections 
to the opioid epidemic are omnipresent—and the af­
tershock is far from over.

Dr. Madden, the founder and CEO of the APT 
Foundation, said the opioid crisis continues to grow 
in Connecticut. According to Madden, in 2017, 1,038 
people in the state died of an opioid overdose. Nation­
wide, she estimated, upwards of 110 people are dying 
per day relative to opioid use disorders.

While the opioid crisis rages throughout Connecti­
cut and the rest of the country, with 2.3 million Ameri­
cans suffering from addiction, the scientific researchers 
at Yale have yet to interrogate the name looming over 
the Sackler Institute.

When I asked Professor Kwan about the Sackler 
funds, he responded much like the other professors.
“I have not put much thought into it.”
