EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
We were in the greenhouse. It was humid and warm 
and so green that you could hardly bear to look at it, and 
Donoghue was walking back from the microscopes in the 
far room carrying a magnolia bloom. The bloom was small 
and olive green in his wrinkled hand, like a pea pod, and 
he held it gently. The students were already leaving their 
sketchbooks, starting to gather round.

“You’ll all want to watch this,” Donoghue said to them. 
He was standing in the front and holding the tiny bloom 
aloft. Everyone stared at him in quiet intensity. “You nor­
mally use a scalpel to dissect a flower, but for this you’ll 
want to just use your hands. Now watch closely what I do.”

Donoghue pinched the bloom and began to pull. Little 
green flakes came away. He was peeling it like an onion, 
and it came undone in tiny green layers. The students 
watched around him.

“I haven’t really done anything important yet,” Donoghue 
once told me. “I’ve just looked at a lot of plants. Maybe one 
of these days I’ll do something.”

The outer layer of the magnolia lay in flakes on the floor. 
Inside, the flower was as green as grass in spring. Tiny stalks 
curled inward. “These are the stamens,” Donoghue said. 
He pulled one away and looked at it. It was thinner than 
a needle.

“You know, I’ve chosen in the last decade or so to spend a 
lot of time—an inordinate amount of time—studying these 
particular plants. And people might say, ‘Why do you keep 
studying that same plant?’ And the answer is, ‘Because it 
gets more and more interesting!’ The more I learn, the more I 
can’t resist the next question.”

“And then we can go deeper,” Donoghue said, dropping 
the stamen. He applied himself again to the bud, removing 
the stamens and then, with a lover’s lightness, peeling tiny 
green flakes away from the center. The class watched in 
silence. The magnolia was now smaller than a thimble.

“I could tell you a good story about why this leaf looks like 
this and that leaf looks like that. But that’s not the deep mes­
sage. The deep message is dig deeper, and you’ll find more 
and more. Just keep digging.”

Donoghue peeled off the last green flake. At the cen­
ter of the magnolia, there was a tiny stalk of darkest green. 
Donoghue named it the carpel and held it aloft. He told 
the class they should try to draw it. It was the ovary of the 
flower.
