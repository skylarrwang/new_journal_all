Bringing forth new allegations, Black students and New Haven residents say that Yale’s police 
presence has threatened their sense of safety and belonging.

THE  NEW  JOURNAL
A
round two o’clock in the morning, on May 
8, Lolade Siyonbola woke up from a nap. Siy­
onbola, a Black graduate student who lived in Yale’s 
Hall of Graduate Studies, had fallen asleep on a couch 
in a common room while working on a paper. When 
Siyonbola woke up, Sarah Braasch, a white graduate 
student who also lived in the building, confronted 
her. Braasch hadn’t recognized Siyonbola, and called 
the police on her while she was sleeping. As captured 
by Siyonbola’s video recording of their conversation, 
Braach intoned, as if disciplining a child, “I have 
every right to call the police,” nodding her head as she 
spoke. “You cannot sleep in that room,” she explained. 
On her phone, she snapped pictures of Siyonbola.
“Continue,” Siyonbola told her quietly. “Continue. 
Get my good side.” It took the Yale Police Department 
only five minutes to reach the building.

Following YPD protocol, the two officers who 
arrived initially asked Siyonbola to provide her stu­
dent ID. After she demonstrated that she could open 
the door to her apartment with her keys, the officers 
continued to press her for her ID. She relented, hand­
ing them her wallet. Upstairs, a third officer also 
checked Braasch’s identification. But with Siyonbola, 
a problem arose that took fifteen minutes to sort out; 
the name on her ID was a nickname, Lolade, which 
didn’t match her legal name in the Yale Police’s data­
base, Ololade. “I deserve to be here,” Siyonbola told 
the officers as she waited for them to allow her to go. 
“I paid tuition like everybody else. I am not going to 
justify my existence here.”

Over the course of a few days, Siyonbola’s video 
recording of the incident garnered over 1.5 million 
views on Facebook Live. National news outlets from 
CNN to The New York Times reported on the story. 
Jean-Louis Reneson, another Black graduate stu­
dent, posted on Facebook that Braasch had called the 
police on him three months before, when he was lost 
in HGS and had tried to ask her for directions. Four 
police officers arrived in response to that call, and left 
upon realizing that Reneson was a student. Reneson 
declined to comment for this article, and Siyonbola did 
not respond to multiple requests for comment. After 
Siyonbola posted the video online, a petition calling 
for Braasch’s removal from the Graduate School of 
Arts and Sciences gathered 3,000 signatures; Braasch 
remains a student at Yale. President Peter Salovey, 
Yale College Dean Marvin Chun, and Secretary and 
Vice President for Student Life Kimberly Goff-Crews 
sent out University-wide emails in which a series of 
meetings and “listening sessions” with students were 
promised and commitments to diversity and inclusion 
were renewed. The event became so infamous that 
students still refer to it as “what happened at HGS.”

The HGS encounter is one of several accounts of 
biased policing brought forth by students and New 
Haven community members in recent years. This piece 
reports two new sets of allegations—one at GPSCY, 
Yale’s grad student bar; the other at an off-campus 
venue—not previously covered in the media. These 
events raise questions about the role of the police on 
Yale’s campus. When does policing at Yale draw a 
boundary between those who are presumed to belong 
on campus and those who aren’t? How far should the 
YPD go to enforce borders between Yale and the sur­
rounding city? When is a 911 call a plea for safety, and 
when is it a method of exclusion?

In the middle of the night on January 11, 1824, 
someone—likely a Yale student—seized the body of 
Batsheba Smith, the deceased daughter of a farmer, 
from her West Haven grave. The thief stowed the body 
on the floor of the Yale Medical College cellar, fold­
ing her corpse so it would look like a pile of clothes. 
When the New Haven constable discovered the body 
and news got around, six hundred outraged citizens 
gathered in front of the Medical College building, 
armed with weapons and stones. “Tear down the Col­
lege,” they chanted, until city guards stepped in and 
arrested some of the rioters.

As Yale’s website tells the story, this riot was the rea­
son the city assigned two New Haven Police officers, 
Bill Wiser and Jim Donnelly, to regularly patrol the 
campus. The University later hired Wiser and Don­
nelly, making them the inaugural officers of the first 
private university police force in the nation.

It’s unclear whether the riot was actually the cata­
lyst for the formation of the YPD, as Wiser and Don­
nelly weren’t assigned to police Yale until 1894—a 
good seventy years after the body-snatching incident. 
Yet the riot perhaps exemplified the rocky relation­
ship between the school and the city that led to the 
Department’s founding. In his autobiography, Wiser

vide access to their records and files when asked. The 
Department denied their request, citing a need to pre­
serve the privacy of the students involved under the 
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, as well as 
a legal exception that allows them to withhold mate­
rials related to “uncorroborated allegations.” Had Siy­
onbola not recorded the HGS incident on her phone, 
no evidence corroborating her experience would have 
been publicly accessible.

In fact, as the Independent reported, the YPD has a 
history of denying FOIA requests, bringing forth ques­
tions about the transparency the public can expect 
from a private police force. In 2007, the Department 
rejected the FOIA request of a lawyer, Janet Perrotti, 
whose client claimed to have been racially profiled 
by an officer. At the time, the Yale Police claimed 
that as a private police force, it was not subject to 
FOIA at all. The Connecticut Freedom of Informa­
tion Commission (FOIC) sided with Perrotti. If the 
Department could arrest people and put them in jail, 
the Commission concluded, it should have to disclose 
requested materials to the public under FOIA.

But the following year, after the Yale Police union 
requested that the Department disclose the salaries of 
top officials, the FOIC ruled that the Department did 
not resemble a public agency in its financial opera­
tions, and thus did not need to disclose that informa­
tion. Similar legal battles over whether FOIA applies 
to private university police forces have occurred in 
recent years at universities across the country, includ­
ing Harvard and Notre Dame.

Yale Police Chief Ronnell Higgins calls the YPD “a 
private entity with a public purpose.” In this respect, 
the YPD is similar to a private prison, or a charter 
school. And like these kinds of institutions, it faces 
the challenge of balancing the interests of its private 
organization with its obligations to the public.

Today, the Yale Police force has grown to nine­
ty-three officers. It works alongside a Yale Security 
team, which, according to Yale’s website, “serves as 
the eyes and ears of the YPD” inside buildings and 
parking lots. Today, when someone dials 911 from 
an on-campus location, the phone call routes to the 
YPD. According to Chief Higgins, the YPD and the 
NHPD frequently collaborate; their detectives confer 
on major investigations, their patrol routes overlap, 
and they route calls to each other. Sometimes, officers 
from each department will respond to a call together. 
YPD officers walk, bike, and drive along “beats,” or 
patrol routes, both within the campus boundaries and 
in areas adjacent to campus.

Since Yale’s recent expansion into the Dixwell 
neighborhood with the opening of Benjamin Frank­
lin and Pauli Murray colleges in 2017, Jeannia Fu, a 
student at the School of Public Health, has noticed 
an increased police presence in the area. Fu, who is 
Asian, has straight, cropped hair and speaks in a level, 
earnest tone. She has lived in New Haven for nine 
wrote that he and Donnelly were appointed to police 
Yale because “many stories were told of the trou­
bles and fights between the students on the one side 
and the city police and citizens on the other.” Wiser 
and Donnelly’s primary role was to defend Yale stu­
dents from their neighbors, rather than the other way 
around. “As outlined by the police,” he wrote, “our 
duties were to protect the students, their property, and 
all college property from injury.” According to Wiser, 
intruders had been wandering onto university land 
and stealing students’ belongings. Early in his posi­
tion at the university, Wiser found himself kicking 
“tramps” out of the basements and forcing a “colored 
gentleman” to leave one of the building entrances. 
“The first thing to do, it seemed to us,” he wrote, “was 
to keep all suspicious characters from the campus.”

Yale students initially regarded Wiser and Don­
nelly with mistrust, regarding them as outsiders and 
discplinarians. Yet the officers managed to endear 
themselves to the community. They taught students 
to sew on buttons and counseled them through peri­
ods of homesickness. In time, they were given lodg­
ing in campus dorms. As Wiser tells it, the pair grew 
so attached to the College that when the city police 
department sought to reassign them to a different 
post, Wiser and Donnelly quit and were subsequently 
appointed by the University as “special constables,” 
now private employees.

For decades, the Yale Police Department remained 
relatively small. But in the 1960s and ’70s, student 
protests erupted across the country as part of the Civil 
Rights Movement and the flurry of activism against 
the Vietnam War. In response, more and more univer­
sities began to form their own police departments, hir­
ing officers who were trained to interact with college 
students. By 2012, according to the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics, 75 percent of over nine hundred four-
year colleges surveyed across the country employed 
an armed police force. 86 percent of campus police 
officers had the power to arrest in regions beyond the 
campus borders.

In the ’70s, Yale expanded its force and tightened 
its training programs and standards for officers. At 
first, the University attempted to downplay the YPD’s 
status as a police force; officers utilized unmarked 
cars and wore suits as uniforms. John W. Powell, a 
campus security consultant who served as Director of 
Security and Associate Dean of Students from 1960 to 
1968, described the Department’s transition to blue 
uniforms that more closely resembled city police offi­
cers’ attire, mimicking the NHPD so as to project an 
image of safety and deter crime.

Appearances aside, important distinctions remain 
between the YPD and its New Haven counterpart. On 
May 16 of this year, the New Haven Independent wrote 
that it had filed a request for the YPD’s body-camera 
footage of the Hall of Graduate Studies incident in 
May under the Connecticut Freedom of Information 
Act (FOIA), which requires all public agencies to pro-
