Rock lives
or so I've heard.
But let's face it: Original rock 'n' roll-
and all alternative music, for that matter,
from pop to punk, emo to electronic
is as
good as dead on the Yale campus. Naming
even a handful ofYale bands (or Yale rock
shows, or Yale alternative music venues) is
harder than getting into Yale. That's not to
say that Yale is a silent campus. Concerts
featuring classical music ensembles and . a
capella groups crowd Yale's extracurricular
calendar. So whatever happened to rock 'n'
roll?


It might be tempting to blame inher-
ent flaws in our generation for a decline in
campus music, much as our parents have
pinpointed everything from our ambition
to our apathy to ~xplain today's supposed
lack of campus activis~. But look no far-
ther than Yale's Connecticut cousin Wes-
leyan, whose Middletown campus is an ex-
perimental music hub, to dispel this theory.
Wesleyan junior Ben Bernstein describes
a "climate ... [of] appreciation and open-
ness to new music." Bernstein transferred
to Wesleyan from Colby College
where
he says he had formed "basically the only
band on campus"
specifically because he
had heard "how great [Wesleyan's] music
. "
scene ts.


The most recent Wesleyan posterchild
was the duo MGMT (The Management),
whose catchy but fresh synth tune "Time
to Pretend" was this year's de facto indie
anthem. The indie afro-pop sensation
Vampire Weekend, formed two years ago
at Columbia University, just found main-
stream success in the ample airtime their
song "Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa" enjoyed
during the Beijing Olympics. As Wes-
leyan and Columbia prove, elite co.llege
campuses can
and should · be sites of
musical experimentation. And Yale Col-
lege, with its creative student body and
its world-class music school, should be no
exception.
Enter Michael Waxman,' Timothy
Dwight junior, the' singer-songwriter-
entrepreneur who very well may be the.
change Yale's alternative music scene has
been waiting for. Waxman is the founder
of the imaginatively named Yale Music
Scene, a new organization committed to
promoting original rock music on campus.
The organization's most significant con-
tribution is its website, Yalemusicscene.
com. The site launched in early spring of
2008 with deliberately little fanfare. "It's
sort of a strawman," says Waxman of the
current site, meaning that it is a blue-
print of sorts for his burgeoning ideas for
Yale's music scene. But Yalemusicscene.
com shows no outward signs of being a
work-in-progress. The site not only looks
professionally rendered
it is. Waxman
convinced buddies from Silicon Valley,
where he relocated for 18 months after his
freshman year in order to co-found an in-
ternet startup company, to design the site.
"It was a low key deal because this is their
passion," he says.


Fragmented and
neglected, Yale's
alternative music
community redefines
battle of the bands
ByLauraZax

The result is a website that is argu-
ably in better shape than the music scene
it promotes. "It makes the music scene
look more legitimate than it really is," says
Ted Gordon '08, co-founder of the music
magazine gunslinger., which was recently
rechristened and reimagined as the glossy-
fronted Volume. The site features cheeky
band biographies, photos, a forum for
listing upcoming shows, and even a music
player that allows users to download Eli
originals. From the logo's iPod-ad-esque
silhouette of a badass with a badass guitar
down to the trendy font of even the small-
est headings, the site's graphics are flaw-
lessly professional. But bells and whistles
do not a music scene make. The fact that,
in order to populate his site with content,
Waxman had to organize events
such as
last spring's Party Like A Rockstar, which
featured performances by several of the
ten bands included on the website
is a
case m pmnt.
Rock 'n' roll has always iden-
tified as the enemy of the es-
tablishment, and Yale is, well
the establishment.
It's fitting that the home of Yale's mu-
sic scene should be on the World Wide
'
Web, not only because of the central role
the Internet plays in music distribution
in the 21st Century, but also because of


--- Page 29 ---

the centralizing role cyberspace can play
to compensate for . fragmented physical
space. In fact, the website's most promis-
ing potential is as a common forum where
a scattered music scene could achieve some
degree of unity, however small and howev-
er cyber. After all, the essence of a "scene"
is a group of people coming together be-
cause of a shared interest~ A music scene
demands the interaction of musicians both
with one another and with their fans. But
at Yale, alternative music is disjointed by
a residential college system that can make
the logistics for staging a show
or even
just a rehearsal
prohibitively burden-
some. "You can try to get into the DMCA
.
[Digital Media Center for the Arts] · or
try to get into a college that has whatever
equipment you're looking for, but there's
nothing centralized," Gordon laments.
During his freshman year, Waxman
also experienced the frustration of Yale's
fragmented music scene. After succeeding
. in reserving the Silliman common room
for a show, he learned that finding a venue
was only half the battle. "It was such an
ordeal," he remembers.
While every college has a music prac-
tice room equipped with a piano, only
Calhoun, Silliman, and Timothy Dwight
have drum kits. (A handful of others are
home to students' personal drum kits dur-
ing the academic year, but whether any old
Eli can use them is at the discretion of their
owners.) Silliman and TD are the only col-
leges with recording studios. Though the
studios can be reserved by students from
any college, Yalies are denied access to the
equipment and practice spaces of any but
their own residential colleges. So if you
want your rock band to have percussion,
make sure you get a drummer in Cal-
houn, Silliman, or TD. Speakers are an-
other issue. "The only sound system is in
Calhoun's basement, and getting it out is
basically the bottleneck for setting up con-
certs," says Waxman. The Undergraduate
Organizations Funding Committee owns
a PA available to any student group, but
it's a coveted resource. "It's really hard to
reserve
every organtzatton wants to re-
serve it," says Gordon.
While residential college red tape is a
perennial problem for bands at Yale, con-
struction tape will prove an additional
stumbling block this year. The one de-
pendably accessible venue for alternative
music shows is the Calhoun Cabaret, an
September 2008
intimate space in the basement of Calhoun
which can open up to incorporate the. But-
tery space for larger, louder shows. It's a
favorite partly because a drum kit and PA
system are housed just down the hall in
Calhoun's music practice room, and partly
because it's managed by the inspiring Da-
vid Kant, a senior musician whose band
Lady Lovelace and the Calculator Death
Machine is the most prolific and promi-
nent current Yale band.
During Calhoun's renovation, the ex-
perimental music scene will be exiled from
its only reliable home and will have to im-
provise. College common rooms and din-
ing halls are potential venues, but hosting
shows in spaces not designed for them is
a logistical nightmare, and it's often a bu-
reaucratic one, too. "People don't want to
have rock concerts [in their colleges] be-
cause they assume there's going to be beer
and it's going to be loud and destructive,"
Gordon explains. House shows are anoth-
er possibility; Wesleyan's music scene, for
instance, is intimately tied to off-campus
houses.
However, because off-campus
housing at Yale is anything but institu-
tional, there's no guarantee that houses
that have been hosts to the alternative
music scene in the past
1 09 Howe, for
instance
will fall into the hands of ten-
ants who want to have the responsibility of
carrying on a tradition of loud music.
That's not to mention the fact that off-
campus shows do not benefit from Yale's
protective stamp of approval. On the Fri-
day that the class of2012 moved in, these-
mester's-first rock concert
a performance
-by Great Caesar and the Go-Getters at a
house on Elm Street
was shut down by
the cops only two songs into the setlist~
But Waxman has faith that the music~
scene will ultimately secure the institution-
al infrastructure it needs. At an event last
year, he wound up brushing shoulders with
Peter Salovey, Dean of Yale College and a
musician himsel£ Waxman broached the
subject ofYale's nearly non-existent music
scene with Salovey, who was effusive about
the effect of Stanford's music scene on his
own college experience. From Salovey,
Waxman learned of a proposed music cafe
at the site . of the new colleges. Waxman
was delighted, but hardly satisfied. "That's
a 2015 thing," he says. "Their time frame
is on a much larger scale than mine."
In the meantime, the music scene could
benefit from even the most modest shared
space and equipment. Forget, for now, a
concert hall: The Yale music scene needs
a. closet. Indeed, Wesleyan's music scene
. thrives · in part because of such a closet-
" a little shed," in Bernstein's words, that
stores amps, speakers, and PAs. The shack
also serves as the humble headquarters of
Wesleyan's Sound Co-op, a group that
exemplifies the type of centralized and in-
stitutionally supported organization that
Yale's music scene lacks and that Waxman
hopes to create. The Sound Co-op is exac.t-
ly what it sounds like: a team of students
trained as technicians who run sound at all
student shows, alternative and otherwise.
What's more, the administration
at a
school whose endowment is a mere 3 per-
cent ofYale's
pays the students to do so.
Such administrative support exists at Yale
for other undergraduate artistic endeavors.
Theater thrives here and the a capella scene
is, if anything, a little too vibrant.
Perhaps alternative music is simply too
lowbrow for an institution as historically
elite as Yale. The three R' s of the alterna-
tive music ethos are Rock, Rebellion, and
Revolution. Rock 'n' roll has always iden-
tified as the enemy of the establishment,
and Yale is, well, the establishment. It's
not surprising, then, that, excluding Bud-
dy Holly, rock's nerdiest founding father,
the purveyors and promoters of alternative
music have looked very little like the four-
eyed, penny-loafered types who end up at
Yale. Three-fourths of the Beatles didn't go
to college, and 100 percent of them never
graduated: The coursework that earned
Sir Paul's honorary degree from Yale last
spring was a lifetime of creating rock mu-
sic. In fact, perhaps the most famous alter-
native singer, songwriter, and innovator to
come out ofYale made nothing more than
a pitstop on campus: David Longstreth,
the mastermind behind the -experimental
group The Dirty Projectors, dropped out
ofYale before completing a B.A. in music
in order to launch his successful indie ca-
reer. Hence the argument that Yale's lack
of support for alternative music is exactly
what the scene needs: "Would you really
want it that the administration would em-
brace an alternative music culture?" Wax-
man asks rhetorically. "You can't have a su-
perhero without its foil. It's a relationship
created out of contrast."
