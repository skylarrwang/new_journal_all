UPPER CRUST 
"Big Pete and Little Pete are big pizza-eaters," says Alicia Mehr, Big Pete's daughter 
and Little Pete's mother. Raising Alicia in 
Cheshire, Connecticut, Big Pete inculcated her in the ways of pizza. The family eschewed New Haven's holy trinity Pepe's, 
Sally's, and Modern 
for anonymous suburban 
joints. "There's an awful lot of really 
good pizza other than those tourist trap 
places," Alicia confides. 

Whenever she visits Connecticut from 
Washington, D.C., where she's planted 
her own family, she eats at Grande Apizza, 
a nondescript restaurant on a strip of East 
Haven highway. And after she and her husband, Joel, tasted nearly every pie on 
the Eastern seaboard in preparation for the 
launch of their own pizza restaurant last 
April, they settled on Grande's as a model. 
Joel trained in the Grande's kitchen to perfect the crispy, blackened crust that sets 
"New Haven-style" pizza apart from New 
York-style, 
Naples-style, 
Chicago-style, 
and every other entry in the serious pizza-
eater's index. "In New York," Joel says, "the 
dough has usually some olive oil in it, possibly a little honey or sugar. In Naples, the 
dough has egg in it. We're just flour, water, 
salt, and yeast." 

When settling on a location, the couple 
looked no farther than a Metro stop away 
from Petworth, their own D.C. neighborhood. Joel grew up in a nearby suburb, but 
he imagined his long yearned-for "pizza-
concept" restaurant not on the leafy avenues of Friendship Heights or the baby-
strollered sidewalks of Bethesda, but in the 
bizarre mish-mash of drug deals, dive bars, 
and superstores that is the "transitioning 
neighborhood" of Columbia Heights. 

Bordering Howard University and the 
frat-infused bar scene of the Adams Morgan neighborhood, Columbia Heights still 
bears the scars of the 1968 riots that ravaged Washington, D.C. after Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination. Ten years ago, 
the area was notorious for barbed wire, vacant lots, and crime. While crime is still 
a problem 
though it is decreasing 
the 
barbed wire and lots are being torn down 
and snatched up by developers. In 1999, 
after the city built a Metro stop on 14th and 
Irving, two of the neighborhood's main 
thoroughfares, the stars aligned for the "urban renewal" of Columbia Heights. Flanking the heavily trafficked Metro stop today 
are a spanking new Target and Best Buy, 
a sparkling Washington Sports Club, and, 
wedged between Potbelly and Five Guys, 
two of D.C.'s largest fast food chains, a 
. 
Peroni-umbrella adorned restaurant called 
Pete's New Haven Style Apizza. 

On a Wednesday evening in July, carefully scruffy men in straw fedoras lounged under the umbrellas with local microbrews 
while two young families shared pizzas at a 
long, blond wood table inside. An Adidas-
attired man awaited a take-out pizza after 
· a work-out across the street, and a solo patron drank wine with her pizza while reading a novel at the polished counter. Weaving 
throughout them all was an ancient Italianate man with a smoothly folded face 
and one gold tooth, wiping down tables 
and clearing plates, a silent fixture of old 
world charm. 

And somewhere between old and new 
would Pete's Apizza (pronounced, Joel insists, "ah-BEETS") like to be. Despite its 
New Haven moniker, the restaurant grasps 
at an Italian sensibility. Photos of Venetian 
canals, medieval stone alleyways, and sun-
soaked vineyards beam down at diners; a 
framed Italian newspaper hangs near the 
bathroom; and a clock ticks off what suspiciously appears to be Italian time. Yet 
the cement floor, imported sodas, and eco-
conscience (a sign in the ladies' room reads: 
"The hand dryer is a bit of a drag ... but we 
use way less paper this way!") appeal to the 
young, decidedly hip patrons attracted to 
Columbia Heights' manageable rents and 
hipster cache. 

Culinarily, Alicia and Joel merge their 
Elm City loyalty with their shared Italian 
fetish. White clams adorn their "New Haven" pie, while the vegetarian bounty of 
the "Edge of the Woods" pizza references 
Whalley's ancient health food store and 
the meaty "Staven" gives a jocular nod to 
East Haven. 

The centerpiece of the menu, Pete's 
"homage to the birthplace of pizza," is 
"Sorbillo's Original." In a stunning betrayal of Pete's civic namesake, however, 
this birthplace is not New Haven but Italy. 
The Sorbillo is more calzone than pizza, a 
big slab of dough filled with ricotta and 
salumi that is as foreign to the New Haven 
pizza scene as Pete's floral centerpieces and 
eclectic wine list. 

But, according to Alicia, even the fiercest devotees of Pepe's and Sally's don't seem 
to mind. "We get a lot of people who grew 
up or went to school at Yale," she says. 
"Recent graduates, older graduates. A lot 
of people with silly attitudes like 'Oh, this 
can't be like New Haven pizza. I'll try it, 
b 
I 
' 
B 
ut I'm sure it won't compare...' But we've 
built quite a good fan base out of those really skeptical people." 

Five months after opening Pete's Apizza's 
. doors, Alicia estimates that the bulk of the 
restaurant's regular customers resides within a five to six-block radius. While this area 
includes everything from dilapidated row 
houses to futuristic condominium buildings to public housing blocks, Pete's happy 
munchers of $23.95 pizzas seem more 
aligned with Barack Obama's brand of 
arugula elitism than a government-assisted 
lifestyle might allow. As Columbia Heights 
treads the gentrification path of other iconic neighborhoods such as Brooklyn or San 
Francisco's Mission District, New Haven, 
ironically, is gaining culinary name value. 
After all, first it's a metro stop, - then 
it's a Target, but once the New Haven-
style pizzeria moves in, the yuppies have 
truly arrived.
