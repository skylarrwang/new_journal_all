**Author:  (Not specified)**

During the last few days of August, while 
the majority ofYalies awkwardly haul box-
es up residential college stairwells, those 
not living in dormitories can be found in 
the neighborhoods surrounding the uni-
versity, moving into their first apartments, 
buying kitchen gadgets, and dreaming of 
dinner parties and queen-sized beds. Ac-
cording to the Yale Daily News, a third 
of Yale seniors move off campus, and the 
Elmhurst, a large brick building on Elm 
Street, becomes home to many of them. 

One resident of the Elmhurst, howev-
er, never needs to unpack. Phil Prince TD 
'52 YSM '59 lives comfortably in his fifth-
floor apartment. Prince is the only non-
undergraduate resident of the notoriously 
~ 
grungy student colony. A New Havener 
for the past sixty years, he has made his 
home in the Elmhurst for the past twenty 

-and has no plans to move. 

Rudys and Phil Prince may~ 
very well be the oldest estab-
lishments on the block. 

Prince grew up in Illinois, the son of 
a preacher-man. When his father took a 
new job as a minister in Greenwich, Prince 
enrolled in a Connecticut prep school. "I 
liked it, but I didn't really fit in at all, being 
a preacher's son. A lot of the people had 
come from really wealthy backgrounds. 
This was the same with Yale," says Prince, 
who worked to put himself through Yale. 
"No fraternities or anything for me." 

Prince arrived in New Haven for his 
freshman year in the fall of 1948. After 
â€¢ 
graduating as a Latin major, he studied 
music history at the graduate school before 
receiving his master's at the Yale School of 
Music. An organist, he was employed for 
22 years by Christ Church on the corner 
of Elm Street and Whalley-Avenue. In 
1974, Prince was awarded an associate fel-
lowship in Stiles College for his contribu-
tion to the New Haven community. For a 
while, he took his meals in the dining hall 
so he could get to know the Stiles under-
graduates. 

Prince moved to the Elmhurst in 1988 
to live near his retired mother on Lyn-
wood Place. At that time, he explains, the 
Elmhurst housed mostly law and other 
graduate students. "There were a few cou-
ples. One or two of them had children 
actually, or a child; it wasn't really a large 
enough place to raise a family decently so
