bother with expensive special education 
classes. "If a kid acts up in the charter 
schools, you throw them out," he explains. 
"You can't do that in the public school 
system." Not only do charter schools pull 
funds from traditional public schools, Cas-
sano contends, but they deplete human re-
sources as well, attracting the most highly 
motivated students and involved parents 
in the city. This phenomenon, he says, of-
ten contributes to racial imbalances within 
charter schools. 
Cassano -aults charter schools 
or their ability to skirt. the 
rules and not bother with 
special education 
expenstve 
classes. 

But Cassano's anti-charter argument, 
while common enough, fails to tell the 
whole story. 88 percent of Common 
Ground students are minorities, a num-
ber similar to those of New Haven's non-
charter public schools: Wilbur Cross and 
Hill House High School educate 90 and 
98 percent minorities, respectively. Com-
mon Ground does possess a devoted par-
ent population, and its student body of-
ten arrives at the school better-prepared 
than their Wilbur Cross or Hill House 
peers 
students who end up in a charter 
school are 20 percent more likely to have 
attended pre-kindergarten programs than 
their public, non-charter school peers. But 
state statistics from 2002 show that char-
ter school parents participate in "limited" 
volunteering at their children's schools, if 
at all. In fact, the charter school popula-
tion tends to be of lower income and lower 
family education history than that of regu-
lar public schools, and charter schools re-
ceive less per-pupil funding than their reg-
ular counterparts. But Tom Murphy, the 
state's educational spokesman, insists that 
of all Connecticut parents, those consid-
ering charter schools are among the most 
invested in their children's education. 
According to the Connecticut De-
partment of Education in 2002, "charter 
schools were not having an easily discernible 
positive or negative impact on traditional 
public schools"; if anything, competition 
between charter and local district schools

might have led to mutual progress. Tom 
Murphy maintains that "there is a place for 
charter schools ..... but they're not for ev-
eryone." Connecticut's 18 charters are slim 
pickings compared to states like Arizona or 
Florida, which have twenty times as many. 
Murphy notes that charters are necessary 
for "choice" in education, though he ac-
knowledges the exclusion inherent in these 
smaller schools. While charter schools can 
cull the best students from a pool of ap-
plicants, "neighborhood schools have the ~ 
responsibility to educate all children who 
walk through their doors." 

Because property taxes pay for public 
schools, Connecticut's wealthiest children 
will always be at an advantage. With teach-
ers in Greenwich making $20,000 more 
yearly than their New Haven counterparts, 
the achievem.ent gap in low-income com-
munities is unsurprising. Last year, just 
over 60 percent of New Haven eighth-
graders scored "at/above proficiency" on 
the math portion of the Connecticut Mas-
tery Test, as opposed to 90 percent of stu-
dents in the nearby suburb of Branford. 
Common Ground, however, seeks an 
economically diverse student body, and 15 
percent of its students hail from the sub-
urbs. Wilcox, Tolman, Barton, and their 
colleagues hope that in comprehending 
the effect of "place" on their lives and edu-
cations, their students will be able to estab-
lish a "common ground" across economic, 
racial, and geographic lines.
