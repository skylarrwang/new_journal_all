Missionaries live, eat, and proselytize in two-person "companionships:' 
In St. George, Utah, Randen Syphus' · 
hometown, it hardly ever rains. But one 
Saturday night in July, Syphus is far from 
home, and as the blue Dodge Caravan he 
rides in sidles up to the curb, he steps out 
of the passenger seat to a New Haven sky 
heavy with rain clouds. In black suits, col-
lared white shirts, nametags, and ties, Sy-
phus and Chris Eyres, his companion, are 
strangely formal, out of place amidst the 
abandoned, broken-windowed industrial 
buildings northwest of the Yale Divinity 
• 
School. 

Just 21 years old, Syphus and Eyres 
make for unlikely religious shepherds, 
but for the past two years, this has been 
their job. Both left their homes in Utah 
to serve two-year, full-time mission trips 
for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-
Day Saints that eventually brought them 
to the Elm City. In 2006, they numbered 
among the over 80 percent of 19-year-old 
boys from Mormon families who under-
take such trips. 

During his first weeks in New Haven, 
a passerby stopped Syphus on this street 
and warned him not to return at night 
unless he wanted to risk being shot. Now,

he's walked it an uncountable number of 
times, and he confidently ushers Eyres 
across the wide parking lot of the Sheffield 
Oaks apartment complex. 

The downpour hasn't yet starred when 
the two enter the first-floor vestibule. Sy-
phus punches in the access code and they 
climb to the second floor, where a woman 
named Beulah lives. When they reach her 
door, Syphus is the one who knocks 
one 
long, four shorts, two longs. They wait. 
Beulah has no phone, but Syphus has vis-
ited her apartment for their thrice-weekly 
standing date enough times to know: "She's 
not here. If she was, she'd have yelled for 
b 
, 
us y now. 

They descend .the back stairway a little 
more slowly than they ascended it, looking 
for a place to sit down. When they stop 
at a wooden porch by a dumpster in the 
parking lot, the sky finally breaks open, 
and they sprint for the van. "We just can't 
catch a break," they groan over their shoul-
ders. 

The seclusion and asceticism the Mor-
mon Church demands of missionaries like 
Syphus and Eyres is a far cry from the he-
donism of college. Yet the Church man-
ages to deploy over fifty thousand full-time 
Mormon missionaries across the globe, the 
vast majority of whom are men and wom-
en in their early 20s. A handful are Yalies 
who have formally withdrawn from the 
University to serve. 

Although their methods vary, they are 
all geared toward a common goal: to re-
cruit converts to the Mormon Church. 
And while they've all faced countless re-
Jections in their quest to share their faith, 
these young missionaries' efforts have un-
doubtedly helped make Mormonism one 
the fastest-growing religions in the world. 

ON A SuNDAY MORNING in May, Syphus 
sat in the middle row of an assembly room 
in a modest brick building on Trumbull 
Street. The blue folding chairs were filled 
with the entire New Haven ward of the 
. Mormon Church, congregants of every 
demographic 
a harried, young-looking 
blond couple with an infant and two tod-
dlers in tow; a dark-haired teenager who 
directed hymns from the front of the 
room; a middle-aged Hispanic woman 
who affectionately patted the cheek of a 
white-haired man as she hurried past him , 
on her way to her seat. 

When Smith served with Sy-
phus~ they each kept all o 
their belongings 
two years' 
· worth 
in two suitcases. New 
Haven is Syphus' third assign-
ment, and Smith can no lon-
ger recall how many cities he 
served. 

A young Hispanic couple had been 
baptized the week before and was being 
confirmed just in front of the wooden po-
dium. "Welcome as part of a great broth-
erhood and sisterhood," announced Mike 
Turner, the ward bishop and a third.-year 
graduate student in molecular biology at 
Yale. 

In the back row, a young blond man 
repeated Turner's words in quiet Spanish 
into a black headset; roughly a fifth of 
the congregants listened to his transla-
tion through receivers and headphones 
they grabbed from an over-full bin by the 
door. The church has no shortage of Span-
