While you, dear reader, were NYC-DC/ 
Euro/ Mrica/ Asia/South America-tripping, 
I was left in New Haven to brood on my 
withering relationship. I had dated a boy 
until June, when he had graduated and 
moved to California. During his one trip 
back East, we walked across the Brook-
lyn Bridge and broke up. I spent the rest 
of the summer single, and it didn't help 
that I could see the roof of his old house 
from the window of my summer sublet on 
Edgewood Avenue. Riding his roommate's 
ricke;.ty red· bike tlown Chapel Street and 
staring at a computer all day ("research," 
they call it) only facilitated my angst. 

But it was summer, I needed to study 
for the MCAT, and my wallowing had to 
end. Unfortunately, during the swelter-
ing New Haven summer, libraries kick 
students out by sunset and cafes dose by 
twilight. Only the sterile lights of Star-
bucks beckon to the tired, the poor, and

the internet-deprived masses yearning to 
breathe free air conditioning until 11:30 
p~m. By mid-July, I found myself shell-
ing out crumpled bills for the cheapest tea 
merely to sit and study. 

One Monday night, Starbucks was 
hopping with students, artists, and home-
less people alike, with no empty table to 
be found .. I spotted two souls engaged in 
earnest conversation: a boy and girl sit-
ting at two separate little tables. I pointed 
them out to my companion, who kindly 
asked if the two could sit together. After 
much head-tilting and questioning (Her: 
' 
''Are you sure my Orgo book will fit on the 
table?"; Him: "I suppose I can place these 
papers on my lap and read ... "), the girl 
scooched over. I smiled guiltily at them 
as I sat down, realizing I'd seen them here 
before. She was that girl with the I-smell-
something-awful face and the too-tight 
ponytail who was perpetually trudging 
into Starbucks and collapsing at a table 
with her heavy textbook. He was that boy 
in the plaid shirt who read papers from a 
briefcase and stared too much

Until now, they had sat apart. Over the 
next two hours, while I tried to plumb the 
depths of the kidney's nephron system, the 
girl complained about lab grading while 
the boy nodded sympathetically and gave 
pointers about the MCAT. I tried to listen 
in, but all I could catch was- that he went 
to Yale's graduate school (so he took the 
MCAT for fun?). Taunted by the kidneys 
in my book and Starbucks' Frank Sinatra 
THE NEW JOURNAL 

soundtrack, I feebly walked out. 

The next night,. I spotted Granola. 
Browned and muscular, glossy hair in a 
ponytail, a few rings and hemp bracelets, 
reflective sunglasses. When I saw him, I 
dreamt of mountaineering and camping 
trips. I had glimpsed him striding around 
the medical campus, sometimes discreetly 
donning a doctor's white coat. Granola 
liked to study at Starbucks too. He espe..: 
dally favored the large desk in the middle 
of the room, the one with the blue lamps. 
Today, I sat at a table nearby with a friend 
who gleefully slid her eyes from his ebony 
locks to me. As soon as two seats at the 
central table freed up, she pranced over 
with me in tow. Predictably, she left short-
ly thereafter, leaving me, Granola, and 
my MCAT book. I glanced up between 
scanning diagrains of the kidney. He read 
with intense fury and wore a Medecins 
Sans Frontieres T-shirt. My heart fluttered. 
An hour later, as he stood up to leave, 
he murmured, "Good luck with that." I 
stammered and asked about his shirt. Still 
shining with intensity, he moved his hands 
gracefully as he talked about years spent 
working with Doctors Without Borders 
and UNICEF. Our two-minute conver-
saon stirred in my MCAT-stuffed brain, 
inspiring many a daydream until the next 
evening at Starbucks. 

Only this time, he sat at a window table 
with his papers 
and a girl. She smiled 
sweetly and he gazed disgustingly (in love). 
Though two feet of table separated them, 
they bent towards each other, hanging on 
to every word and loving glance. I was left 
alone again to brood over my books. The 
plaid-dad grad student in the far back 
looked up when the bitter pre-med walked 
· in and dropped her textbook onto a table. 
He quickly glanced down. She looked at 
him. While she bought coffee, he casually 
walked by the counter (Him: "Oh, hello! 
Didn't see you there!"; Her: "Hey, what 
a surprise!") Ten minutes later, the coffee 
cooled as love simmered between them.
