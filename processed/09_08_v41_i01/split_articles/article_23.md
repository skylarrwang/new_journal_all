JONATHAN EDWARDS STUDENTS, WE SALUTE YOU

On August 27, 2008, hundreds of young Yale men and women returned to New Haven to find a home. Instead, like sinners in the hands of
an angry God, they found a place of turmoil. Some lost power, some lost boxes, and some were even exiled to the cold halls of the Omni Hotel, for
from friends andfrat parties. To each proud Spider who bravely stayed on campus, who wakes up each morning to the pounding of construction,
and who sleeps cold and dirty at night because they cannot wash with hot water, the staff of 7he New journal sends its thoughts and its wireless.
we have compiled some missives from their courageous leader during this difficult time in order to commemorate their struggles.
TUEDAY, AUGUST 5TH
Dear Members of the JE Classes of 09,
10 and 11,

I assume that you are getting organized
to return to your JE home so I thought
I should give you a heads up, i.e., not all
of the construction is going to be finished
when you get here. As things now stand, we
expect each of you to be able to move into
the room that you have chosen ...

What this also means is that they will
have just laid down the courtyard sod and
we will have to be protective of it for the
first couple of weeks after you return. I will
try to give you a more specific update be-
fore August 27th-a lot can change in three
weeks, I have discovered.

MoNDAY, AuGUST 2 5
12:15 AM

Dear JE Students,
I will probably be sending you more
than the usual move-in messages. This one
is about desks and the courtyard grass.
DESKS IN YOUR ROOMS: on Friday
I discovered that we are short 60 new desks
for JE rooms. The desks were to be assem-
bled and shipped overnight so I hope they
will be in your rooms on Wednesday or Fri-
day (August 27 or 28). Thus, I am request-
ing that you NOT bother me about your
missing desk until after Friday 29 August,
but invite you to if your desk is still missing
(and I have no idea which 60 rooms will be
without a desk).
COURTYARD GRASS: Of course, the
weather is likely to be nice and you will not
be into homework for your first few days
back on campus--an ideal time for a game
in the courtyard. However, they have just
laid the sod and it needs a little time to take
hold before being walked on so I ask that
you stay off the grass for two weeks, that
is, PLEASE DO NOT PLAY ON THE
COURTYARD GRASS BETWEEN 27
AUGUST AND 10 SEPTEMBER. Imag-
ine you are at Oxford or Cambridge where
they don't let you walk on the grass all
year long.

9:33PM

The master's Office will continue to be
open Saturday and Sunday ...

You may also. key my cell phone number
into your address book, but if you use it to
ask about a key, you better pretty well have ·.
exhausted all other options and be stand-
ing naked in the courtyard (and then I am
going to have to ask some questions about
how you carry your cell phone).

9:46PM
Well, the good news is that we have sod
in the courtyard (that you can only· look at
until mid-September); the bad news is that
all students will be moving in on Wednes-
day 27 August. Fifteen of your peers and
Erin Walsh (resident graduate afffiliate) will
be living in the Omni Hotel until 20 Sep-
tember.

WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 2 7

If you discover a problem in your suite,
room, or elsewhere in the Collge, please
send it to me by reply. Here is some general
information. . .

3) We have had some problems with
hot water, i.e., twice it has been at best just
warm and had to be adjusted. It is a very
weak promise again tonight BUT PLEASE
TO NOT EMAIL ME ABOUT THIS BE-
CAUSE I WILL GET THEM TO WORK
ON IT EARLYTOMORROW
4) Plese keep entryway and suite doors
locked.
5) And please stay off the grass.

FRIDAY, AuGusT 29
Dear JE students,
The electrical contractor is ready to in-
stall a portion of the new circuit breakers
today, and will require shutting down the
power for D entry and C entryways. THIS
OUTAGE WILLOCCUR FROM 2 PM
TO APPROXIMATLEY 7 PM TODAY,
FRIDAY 29 AUGUST.

The remaining breakers will be installed
tomorrow, SATURDAY 30 AUGUST, and
will require SHUTTING DOWN THE
POWER FROM 9 AM TO 5 PM to entries
A, _B, C, D, E, F, G, H, AND I.

SATURDAY, AUGUST 3 0
Several of you have told me that your
cable is not working, but I keep forgetting
to give you the bad news--it probably will
not be turned on before Wednesday of next
week. Sorry. You are just going to have to .
catch up on your reading or visit your off-
campus friends.

SUNDAY, AUGUST 3 I
I am still getting quite a few messages
about missing boxes, missing furniture,
things that need to be repaired, etc. PLEASE
BE AS EXPLICIT AS YOU CAN, I.E.,
HOW
BOXES, AND INCLUDE
YOUR ROOM NUMBER AND CELL
PHONE NUMBER. Yes, I can look up
both, but why do you wish to waste my
time doing that for you?
Thanks for your consideration and your
patience with this move-in.

TuESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2
Starting tomorrow (September 3rd),
construction workers will arrive at 8:00 pm
to check in and get organized. They will be
instructed not to do any work that will cause
noise and generally move around and talk
quietly until 9:00 am--and then the sawing
and hammering will begin but by that time
you will all"be in class. Right?

This might not work out ideally on
the first day so wait until about Friday to
complain again. Of course, if you really are
roused from sleep between 6-6:30, you can
let me know right away. And when you do
complain, be specific: who did what where
and at what time exactly so we can get ahold
of the guy. Thanks.
