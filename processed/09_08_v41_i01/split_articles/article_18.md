preaching with a rendition of "When the 
Saints Go Marching In." On Wednesdays, 
he and Syphus played pickup football at 
the park, fielding the inevitable questions 
about their faith by offering a copy of the 
Book of Mormon and tutoring sessions on 
the scriptures. 
These resourceful methods, like Smith 
and Syphus themselves, are emblematic of

In 2004, however, the "System" was 
replaced with "Preach My Gospel," a 13-
chapter guide with sections like "How 
Do I Develop Christlike Attributes?" and 
"How Do I Recognize and Understand the 
Spirit?" "It's more about saying what peo-
ple need to hear, when they need to hear 
it," explains Turner, the New Haven ward 
bishop andYale graduate student. 
However, even teaching by the spirit 
requires rigid commitment. Missionaries 
are expected to rise each morning at 6:30 
to study the scriptures as well as to ·plan 
lessons for the day, exercise, and eat. The 
hours from 10 a.m. until 9 p.m. are set 
aside for missionary work 
proselytizing 
and service 
and missionaries are expect-
ed to be in bed by 10:30 p.m. They are al-
lowed one "preparation day" per week, for 
buying groceries, doing laundry, cleaning, 
and letter-writing 
for Syphus and Smith, 
it was pickup ·football Wednesdays 
and 
they attend Sacrament meetings on Sun-
days. 
Missionaries are allowed only one hour 
of Internet access per week and only two 
phone calls per year, one on Christmas and 
~he other on Mother's Day. Thayne Stod-
dard MC '11, preparing for a 2009 mis-
sion, finds this prospect hard to imagine . 
''I'm worried about being isolated [during 
my mission]," he admits. "I've called my 
mom every single day this year." 
The New Haven missionaries have ac-
cess to a car for half the. week, but spend 
the rest of the time traveling by bicycle, 
bus, and foot; whenever possible, mission-
aries are required to rdy on public trans-
portation in the cities they serve. "Noth-
ing can prepare you for what it's like to be 
out there," explains Sebastian Swett}E '09, 
who left Yale in 2004 to serve on mission 
in Milan. ''I'd get tired, and it was a differ-
ent fatigue than what I was used to 
it's 
this constant output of energy." 
Each missionary is responsible for pay-
ing his or her own way, sending $400 to the 
Church for each month of service, money 
which is then redistributed among all of 
the missionaries worldwide for housing 
and food. Smith worked for a sign instal-
lation company before he started his mis-
sion, while Syphus saved $10,000 working 
for his father's concrete-cutting business. 
"That money is sacred money," says Smith. 
"[My mission] means so much more to me 
because I had to work for it." 
But in spite of the thousands of hours 
spent knocking on doors and distributing 
pamphlets and the thousands of dollars to-
ward housing and food, the Church relies 
on its quantity of missionaries, rather than 
their rate of conversion, to spread the faith: 
Church statistics estimate that an average 
of just 4.7 new converts join the Church 
for each year one missionary spends on the 
job . 
THIS RATE IS OFTEN higher in overseas 
mission areas, particularly in Africa and 
South America, despite the linguistic and 
cultural barriers missionaries in these ar-


eas face. Because fluency is essential for a 
group peddling such intangibles as faith, 
all missionaries attend one of 17 Mission-
ary Training Centers (MTCs) worldwide 
before embarking on their trips. Most are 
sent to the MTC in Provo, Utah, where 
they spend between three weeks 
if they 
will be proselytizing in English 
and three 
months studying the scriptures and learn-
ing the intricacies of both teaching their 
gospel and speaking the language they will 
adopt for the next two years. Before em-
barking on his trip to the Poland-Warsaw 
mission in 1998, Turner attended two 
four- to five-hour Polish language classes 
and an evening session on the gospel every 
day for nine weeks at the MTC. 
A second complicating factor is the 
range of responses Mormons can expect 
from country to country and culture to 
culture. Jordan Frandsen MC '08 served 
his mission in Russia, where tracting is il-
legal. Instead, missionaries would go into 
elementary schools to stage puppet shows 
about the evils of alcohol, drugs, and to-
bacco and offer free English lessons in 
peoples' homes, always ending with a mes-
sage of faith. During his mission in Italy, 
Swett also spent time on service activities. 
In one city, he jokes, he and his fellow 
missionaries noticed that everyone always 
seemed to be moving, so they borrowed a 
van from the local Mormon church to act 
as the "muscle of the congregation" and 
help people move. Since Swett felt un-
comfortable stopping people on the street, 
he'd often strike up conversations about· 
faith with strangers he met while traveling. 
"People would ask questions by default 
when you have two big, blond Americans 
in suits and nametags," he laughs. 
During his trip to Romania, Walker 
Frahm JE '1 0 found that the people he 
encountered were wary of his intentions. 
"Romania is still struggling to get out of 
the shadow of communism, and you can 
see that in the way people have a hard time 
talking to others who aren't in their imme-
diate family," he says. "Something like 60 
percent of people ratted on their neighbors 
to the secret police; when everyone is a spy, 
' 
" 
you cant trust anyone. 
And, Frahm continues, in the rare cir-
cumstance when he encountered people 
who were familiar with Mormonism; they 
were sorely misinformed. "You know the 
film Witness? That movie was translated 
into Romanian such that every instance of


the word 'Amish' was replaced with 'Mor-
mon,"' he laughs. "People would b-e like, 
'Oh, Mormons! We respect you and your 
simple way of life ... no electricity .. .' and 
we'd be like, 'No, wrong one!"' 
For Turner, the challenge wasn't skep-
. ticism, but rather an existing faith: He 
· served in Poland, a country that is 89 per-
cent Catholic. "People say that you're not 
a Pole if you're not Catholic," he says: "The 
people who joined the Mormon Church 
in Poland sacrificed a lot to join and were 
denounced by their families." While he 
was there, the one hundred missionaries 
throughout the country saw just sixty bap-
tisms each year. 
THE NUMBERS ARE DAUNTING, but Turnet · 
says that he never used them to measure 
his success as a missionary. "Success is real .. 
ly anytime you help to convey to someone 
that God lives," he says. "It doesn't mean 
that they join the church." 
· 
For Jennifer Gardner ES '05 GRD '08, 
success in her mission meant expanding 
her own beliefs to include a new kind of 
faith: faith in people. "I've gained a greater 
appreciation for individuals of the world 
-·their diversity and also their commonal-
ity. Everyone is looking for meaning in life 
and purpose, and at a basic level, every-
one needs the same things," she explains. · 
Gardner was one of few single women to 
serve a mission, and while the trip remains 
a rite of passage more for 19-year-old male 
Mormons than their female peers, not all 
young men serve missions. Some are pro-
hibited by health concerns, both mental 
and physical, some simply choose not to 
serve, and some are prevented from serv-
ing by the Church itself on the groun<!_s 
that they are "unworthy," which can en-
compass anything from homosexuality, to 
fathering a child out of wedlock, to unre-
solved debt. 
Still, Yale students serving mission trips 
are common enough that there is now a 
process in place for students to leave the 
University for two years without fear of 
losing their spots. Prospective missionaries 
withdraw from the University and then re-
enroll 
a formality, the returned mission-
aries say 
in a new graduating class with a 
brief essay about the time they spent away 
from Yale. But while the bureaucracy of re-
turning to Yale may be trivial, the intrica-
cies of readapting to college life rarely are, 
especially after watching friends and class-
-
·mates graduate and move on. "I was close 
with the class of 2006, but I really had no 
interaction with my new graduating class," 
says Frandsen. 
Austin 'Pulsipher BK '12 is currently 
serving a mission in Taiwan, and although 
he has yet to rejoin the Yale community, he 
already has misgivings about what it will 
entail: "I am scared that I won't know how 
to speak fluid English in a seminar at Yale 
and that my essay writing skills went to 
trash," Pulsipher writes in an e-m;:til from 
Taipei. ''And I am not in the football shape 
that I was before my mission." 
Swett was jarred when his 
ootball coach yelled at him . 
on his second day back. '1 was 
like, 'Why is he yelling at me? 
That's not very Christian o 
h . ,, 
tm. 
His fears are prescient. Rejoining the 
Yale football team after two years, Swett. 
was jarred when his coach yelled at him on 
his second day back. ''A mission is about 
everyone trying to uplift each other," says 
Swett, "and I was like, 'Why is he yelling 
at me? That's no't very Christian of him.'" 
The first Yale paper Swett wrote upon re-
turning was only five pages long, but he 
says that he wrote three drafts and e-mailed 
one to his mother for editing before he felt 
confident enough to hand it in. He'd gone 
two years without writing a single paper. 
In some ways, the mission life was easi-
er, he says. At Yale in the spring, he worried 
about packing, about storing his belong-
ings for the summer, about one last p~per, 
about finding a job. ''As a ·missionary, the 
only thing I worried about was 'Who can I 
help today, and how?"' he says. 
, 
It's an experience familiar to Smith and 
Syphus. Answering questions about their 
mission experience, they comment that it's 
unnerving to spend so much time talking 
about themselves when they're so used to 
focusing on the needs of others. "I'm moti-
vated by something much bigger than my-
self-
eternity," Smith says. "My message 
is to prepare people for life after death. If 
we don't hit the streets, 140,000 people in 
New Haven won't have the restored gospel 
of Jesus Christ. It's much easier to moti-
vate yourself to get out of bed if yo:u're not
