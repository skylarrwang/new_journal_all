Statehouse politics lead New Haven to forge its own solution to prisoner re-entry. 
For the last four decades, controversies over 
crime, punishment, and rehabilitation have 
contributed to the breakdown of urban 
America and the outcome of elections. For 
the last 14 years, John DeStefano has been 
New Haven's revitalizing mayor, fighting a 
slow battle to turn the city around. And 
for the last six months, he has tried to tack-
le one of the most acrimonious crime and 
punishment controversies of them all: pris-
oner re-entry. On February 26, the morn-
ing after three New Haven shootings left 
one man dead and two police officers in 
critical condition, DeStefano called a press 
conference and placed the blame squarely 
on Governor Jodi Rell, citing her refusal 
to develop a meaningful prison re-entry 
program. for ex-convicts. All three shooters 
had criminal records, DeStefano charged, 
and all had fallen through the cracks of a 
system with virtually no state-funded sup-
port for people released from prison. These 
convicts, the allegation continued, were 
September 2008 
only the tip of the iceberg. DeStefano ac-
cused Rell, to whom he had lost a bid for 
governor in 2006, of "dumping" between 
-25 and thirty prisoners released from state 
prison in New Haven each week. Without 
a structured re-entry program or adequate ~ 
social services, these prisoners seemed des-
tined to commit further violent crime. 
AFTER WITNESSING the bitter partisan 
battle over New Haven's ex-convict popu-
lation, one New Haven administrator has 
a plan to evade existing politicallandmines 
and funding quandaries to provide released 
prisoners the support they need. This fall, 
Kica Matos, director ofNew Haven's Com-
munity Services Administration (CSA), is 
launching an ambitious new prison re-en-
try initiative designed to fill the gap left by 
the relative indifference of statewide lead-
ership. If successful, the New Haven Re-
entry Initiative will become one of the first 
government programs in the country to 
unify city social services and community 
outreach resources, both governmental and 
non-governmental, in one comprehensive, 
city-wide resource network. 
As Matos quietly released background 
information on her initiative, Rell engaged 
DeStefano's accusations in a highly public 
feud. that was the climax of what had been 
an eventful year for ConnectiCut's criminal 
justice system. In August of 2007, months 
after progressives had won an extended 
battle to legally raise Connecticut's mini-
mum age for adult prosecution from 16 to 
18, two parolees who had met at a Con-
necticut halfway house viciously murdered 
three members of the Petit family in subur-
ban Cheshire, a town home to three of the 
state's largest prisons. In response to weeks 
of national media attention and a public 
outcry by voters demanding tougher pa-
role restrictions, Rell instituted a nearly 
six-month-long ban on parole hearings 
for prisoners convicted of violent felo-
11 


nies. This measure provoked outrage and 
protests from Connecticut communities, 
New Haven among them, angered by 'the 
delayed return of incarcerated loved ones. 
In early February of 2008, Rell lifted 
her parole ban and instituted new guide-
lines for parole hearings. After DeStefano's 
press conference weeks later, she struck 
back in a public letter released on March 
1 '路 accusing DeStefano of a "frankly shock-
ing" lack of understanding of the criminal 
justice system. None of the three shooters 
that February night, Rell correctly pointed 
out, had been under the supervision of 
the DOC at the time of the shootings; 
they had been on probation under qmrt 
supervision. She also accused DeStefano 
of failing to recognize the "extraordinary 
assistance 
almost entirely at Connecticut 
tax payer expense" that the state police had 
provided New Haven to combat crime. "If 
I were in an ironic frame of mind," Rell 
continued, noting that New Haven ac-
counted for 12 percent of Connecticut's 
prison population, "perhaps I might com-
plain about the city of New Haven 'dump-
ing' its problems with drugs, violence, and 
othet crimes on the state -of Connecticut." 
Though the governor and mayor later 
met with the Department of Corrections 
(DOC) commissioner, Theresa Lantz, to 
discuss their differences, the contentious 
"dumping" issue remained unresolved. 
HoWEVER UGLY, Rell and DeStefano's feud 
drew attention to the disturbing fact that 
Connecticut, a state with over 18,000 
Connecticut citizens currently incarcerated 
and a recidivism rate for released offenders 
calculated by the DOC at 40 percent, lacks 
a comprehensive . plan to smoothly transi-
tion released prisoners back into society. 
Many pinpoint this deficiency as a central 
cause ofNew Haven's crime problem. 路 路 
"What we found when we looked at the 
statistics," Matos explains, "was that a lot 
of these crimes were being committed by 
folks with criminal records." Her conclu--
sions resulted from a year of researching 
the city's crime and incarceration statistics, 
existing social services for released prison-
ers, and successful models for prison re-
entry in other cities around the country. 
Diagnosing New Havens failings, Matos 
asserts that "there are definitely structur-
al problems with the system. Right now, 
there seems to be a missing link between 
the DOC and the people trying to navi-
h 
, 
gate t e system. 
New Haven's numbers on crime and 
recidivism 
the propensity for ex-convicts 
to commit more crimes 
reveal the uphill 
battle the city faces. According to the CSA, 
in 2007, 70 percent of New Haven's ho-
micide victims, 51 percent of its non-fatal 
shooting victims, and 80 percent of sus-
pects for both crimes had criminal records. 
70 percent of all people released from pris-
on, according to the Connecticut DOC's 
annual report on recidivism, are rearrested 
within a year. More than half of them will 
be r~corivicted and a third re-incarcerated. 
Especially troubling for the city is that half 
of these ex-convicts live in only three of 
New Havens neighborhoods: The Hill, 
Fair Haven, and Newhallville.

70 percent of all people re-
leased 
'Om przson are rear-
rested within a , year. More 
than hal of them will be re-
convicted and a third will be 
re-incarcerated. 
"What people have to realize," says 
Mike Lawlor, a Democratic state represen-
tative from East Haven, the Chair of the 
Connecticut House Judiciary Committee, 
and a long-time advocate for judicial re-
form, "is that it's the guys that are getting 
out of prison that are causing a lot of these 
problems." 
According to both Lawlor and Matos, 
recidivism occurs so frequently because 
ex-felons have no way to meet their basic 
needs. "In a lot of these cases it's not hard to 
figure out," says Lawlor. "You need hous-
ing, services, you need supervision." One 
obstacle for released prisoners seeking to 
meet these needs is a lack of legatrights to 
protect them from discrimination. People 
with criminal records are disqualified from 
public housing, a policy that often sepa-
rates them from family and leaves them 
with nowhere to go. Connecticut, unlike 
some states, does not have laws explicitly 
banning discrimination based ~n criminal 
records, which makes it easier for employ-
