they didn't stay there too long after that. 
Then gradually it became almost entirely 
inhabited by undergraduates." 
The neighborhood, like the build-
ing within it, has undergone a significant 
transformation. Prince remembers a qui-
eter New Baven without today's gourmet 
restaurants and ambulance sirens. Over 
the years, the view from his fifth-floor 
window has changed. Three now-absent 
poplar trees stood before the building, and 
the Cosi restaurant down the street was a 
firehouse. The only establishment that has 
always been a fixture . of Elm Street life is 
Rudy's Restaurant, though Prince is none 
too fond of the infamous bar: "Rudy's has 
been here for a long time, and it's been 
one of the detriments of living in the 
Elmhurst," he grumbles. 
Rudy's and Phil Prince mayverywell be 
the oldest establishments on the block. Af-
ter the only other non-undergrad, a Viet-
nam War veteran, was evicted from the 
building about a year ago, Prince recalls, 
he found himself alone in a sea of young 
Yalies 
Though he doesn't mind existing in this 
demographic, he admits that his presence 
can be off-putting for current students. "I 
can remember maybe ten or 15 years ago, . 
it was this time of year, and the people who 
were moving into the apartment next to 
me were describing who lived where, and 
they said, 'There are some undergraduates 
living across the hall and diagonally from 
us, and, urn, downstairs there are some 
. graduate students, but next to us there 
is this really old man!' Of course, now I 
fit that definition, but that was twelve or 
15 years ago, and I don't think I was one

In recent undergraduate mythology, the 
Elmhurst has come to be known as both 
a filthy apartment building and a hipster 
hangout. The building's reputation leaves 
little room for senior citizens. Though 
Prince does wear thick-framed glasses and 
loafers, staples of the hipster wardrobe, 
neither are meant to be ironic. 
Allegra Long ES '08, a two-year resi-
dent of the Elmhurst's fifth floor, describes 
her former home as a scene that's "become 
synonymous with these certain sort of 
parties and these certain people who live 
there. When you tell people you live in the 
Elmhurst, you get an 'Ohhh, you live in 
the Elmhurst. You must dress this way and 
study this thing and be really into talking 
10 
about this thing.''' 
Prince was surprised by his building's 
reputation. He has not noticed any par-
ticularly bohemian tendencies among his 
neighbors, and Prince knows hipsters: In 
1966, he began teaching organ lessons at 
nearby Wesleyan University, whose stu-
dents he describes as "sort of extreme, very 
different from Yale." 
Though Prince does 
wear 
thick- oamed glasses and loa -· · 
ers, staples o ·the hipster ward-
robe, neither are meant to be 
zronzc. 
Long graduated last June, abandoning 
the Elmhurst and what she considers to be 
its deplorable conditions. "It's the cheap-
est building in New Haven,'~ she explains. 
"You pay for what you get. We had holes 
in our walls, we had crooked floors, and 
we had mice. Literally everything you can 
imagine being wrong with an apartment, 
we had." Though she says she "loved" her 
time in the Elmhurst, she is quick to qual-
ify this statement: "We don't really mind, 
because we're college kids, but the idea of 
that being your permanent home ... by the 
end of two years we were done, we were 
ready to be out." When. asked about her 
neighbor, Mr. Prince, Long admits that 
she doesn't know much. "Phil is a mystery 
wrapped in an enigma," ·says Long, who 
shared her bedroom wall with him for 
two years. "No one knows what he does 
for a living." Many Elmhurst undergradu-
ates speculate about their elderly neighbor, 
wondering what his apartment is like and 
if it's nicer than theirs. 
Miranda Popkey BR '09, an editor of 
this magazine, observed Prince from afar 
during her time living on the Elmhurst's 
fifth floor. "He dresses like he's from the 
1950s 
he's kind of stuck there. He wears 
this tan trench coat and a fedora. In the 
summer, he wears those funny white lin-
en button-down shirts that no one has 
worn since Marlon Brando in 'A Streetcar 
Named Desire,"' she says. "He's basically 
Marlon Brando." 
Though he keeps his distance, Prince 
cannot remain oblivious to his student 
neighbors. "I've had a lot of trouble, from 
time to time, with undergraduates living 
in the apartment below me," he says. "They 
come in and they turn on their Hi-Fi or 
whatever you want to call it, their sound 
system, very late at night, 2 a.m., 3 a.m., 
which wakes me up." Prince also acknowl-
. edges that, as the neighborhood has gener-
ally improved, the building itself has only 
deteriorated during his tenure there. 
Despite the Elmhurst's sorry state, 
Prince finds enough to recommend it. "I 
like living close to the library and gym," he 
says. He swims five days a week in Payne 
Whitney's pool 
he's an avid freestyler. 
Prince also appreciates the area's restau-
. rants. "I like Hunan Cafe on York Street 
and Royal India on Howe Street. Those are 
pretty much my favorites," he says. 
His swimming lungs are especially valu-
able when he is forced to trek up some 
seventy steps to his apartment on the not-
too-rare occasion that the building's noto-
riously fickle elevator is out of commission. 
His landlord often suggests that he move 
down a few floors or out of the building 
altogether. Prince has so far ignored this 
suggestion, but he admits that "it's get-
ting harder and harder" to continue his 
decades-long residency. 


For now, however, until he can gather 
enough energy to . haul his life down four 
flights of stairs and out of the building 
which has housed him for the past twenty 
years, Prince remains the enigmatic com-
mon denominator amongst a flurry of stu-
dents on their way to somewhere else.
