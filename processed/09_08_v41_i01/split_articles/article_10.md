PIANIST ENVY 
Last spring, Cafe Bottega on the Green 
blitzed the Yale campus with an arsenal of 
hand-drawn flyers beckoning students to 
pair an epic and ancient martial art with 
their Friday night martinis. Why not take 
a break from school, sit back with your 
" 
girlfriends, and enjoy a piano duel? 

While I vividly imagined menacing 
Baby Grands slashing each other's strings 
with rapiers clenched between their keys, 
or at least pianists from warring families 
duking it out with sabers and epees, I realized that the reality might be a bit tamer 
than expected, more friendly musicians' rivalry than all-out bloodbath. For starters, 
the so-called piano duel was to take place 
in a cafe with an identity crisis 
demure 
coffee shop by day, not-quite-raucous bar 
by night. What's more, the event's name, 
"Keys to the City at Cafe Bottega on the 
Green," was too cumbersome for an effective battle cry. 

Piano duels, to my initial disappointment, are relatively civil affairs and, for 
the most part, do not include a Galoisian 
fight to the death. They don't even have a 
winner. At Bottega, two pianists, decked 
in starred sunglasses and glittery pink top-
hats, switch off playing minute-long, eminently singable renditions of songs that often sound straight off a mix tape made for 
the middle school dance. The audience's 
role is not only to sing along, but also to 
toss money, strip dub-style, at the self-
September 2008 
dubbed "piano whores" in order to request 
a favorite song. Perhaps song prostitution 
lets the audience feel like they are part of 
the duel 
dropping Hamiltons just like 
Aaron Burr. 

I thought I'd arrived unfashionably early at 8:30, but the line was already out the 
door. I felt like a Very Important Person as 
the manager whisked me past the partiers 
corralled by red velvet ropes to the bar for a 
free drink, until I saw him sidle up to three 
already-tipsy women with the proposition: 
"You guys want some free shots?" 

At least the bachelorette party attendees were singing for theirs. The promise 
of dueling pianos attracted an impressive 
array of local characters, and the lure of 
free alcohol, it's fair to say, brought out the 
best in them. I somehow became a party 
to two fifty-year-old women grinding 
during "Baby Got Back," with only their 
outfits topping their performance: skin-
tight denim miniskirts, matching heels, 
and Lycra halters that might have seen a 
previous life as safari camouflage. At least 
their shoes were shielded from the stick of 
spilled alcohol by a thin layer of crushed 
peanut shells. 

On the other side of the room, a gaggle of sixty-year-olds sipping wine under 
a pinata and a balloon printed with the 
words "Over The Hill" seemed less enticed 
by the prospect of getting liquored up. 
"It's alcohol: Smile, for the love of God," a 
pianist chastised them between renditions 
of "Sweet Caroline" and a surprisingly authentic "Gin and Juice." The ladies were 
good sports, only wincing slightly as the 
crowd acted out the Divinyls' greatest hit, 
"I Touch Myself." Chowing down on their 
pizzettes and Kobe beef sliders, they murmured quietly, impervious to the duel raging on all sides. When "Great Balls of Fire" 
entered the battle zone, however, the Over 
the Hill group couldn't help but join in, 
ballroom-dancing and head-bopping with 
the best of them. 

The pianists used their powerful positions as guardians of the Keys to the City 
to forge peace between warring camps. 
Unless, of course, they had started the 
feud, pitching Sox fans against Yankees in 
a name-that-tune contest, or reminding 
a birthday girl forced onstage that "your 
friends have pimped you out to us, so, uh, 
we can do anything we want." Occasionally, they transformed into oracles dispensing opaque pop-culture prophesies. 

"Only you can prevent forest fires," one 
harangued, "or keep Brittany in rehab." 
Nor did the patrons feel a need to silence 
their opinions. "The crowd is getting slut-
tier, don't you think?" shouted one man, 
trying to look displeased as he scanned the 
women in the crowd. "Soon it will just 
be the sluts and the jacked-up beefheads." 

He had reason to fear the "jacked-up beef-
heads." 

Moments later they caused the 
night's first duel-related fatality 
a table, 
succumbing to wounds incurred during 
the "Soulja Boy" dance. 

Miraculously, I survived to see the emptying bar, still littered with peanut shells, 
as I departed from the courageous few who 
were still, as one patron put it, "immersing 
themselves in the cheesy." Like a witness 
to an execution, I imagined, I felt elated, 
exhausted, and alive.
