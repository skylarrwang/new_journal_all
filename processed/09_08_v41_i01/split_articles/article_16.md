ers to turn down ex-offenders looking for 
jobs. 
· 
"Jobs are a huge problem," says Sally 
Joughin, a coordinator of People Against 
Injustice, a New Haven community group 
that advocates for Elm City residents af-
fected by the criminal justice system. "Not 
only because someone spending a long 
. 
time in prison may not have a marketable 
job skill or education, but also because 
there is discrimination against people who 
have been in prison." 


The prevalence of untreated mental 
health and substance abuse issues 
15 
percent of all people released from prison 
have a serious mental illness 
often makes 
it harder for former criminals to find jobs. 
Many parole and probation officers, offi-
cially tasked with addressing these prob-
lems, are burdened with heavy case loads 
that do not allow them to effectively ad-
minister to parolees. Compounding these 
obstacles is the lack of a consolidated and 
accurate list of the few resources available 
to prisoners released in New Haven. "If 
folks come back into the community and 
don't have options," Matos summarizes, 
' 
"it's hard to make sure they don't go out · 
and relapse." 


Unlike Lawlor and DeStefano, who 
have prioritized increasing state aid and 
funding for existing programs, Matos' 
initiative involves working at a local level 
. to encourage cooperation and innovation 
. among existing re-entry resource provid-
ers. Some of the initial changes slated to 
premier this fall are an accurate and up-
dated guide to resources available to every 
prisoner upon release, increased coordina-
tion amongst court support services, and 
regular meetings among state, local, non-
profit, and faith-based organizations work-
ing on re-entry issues. 


Joughin emphasizes the need for stream-
lining re-entry service funding. "Should a 
well-funded state re-entry program be de-
veloped, just as there is a state incarceration 
system?" she asks. "Right now there are 
many different non-profits providing vari-
ous kinds of re-entry programs and com-
peting for state funding. There shouldn't 
be a competition for funds. Every released 
prisoner should automatically be getting 
the services he or she needs." 


Some community activists are skepti-
cal not only of governmental services, but 
also of non-profit efforts to ease re-entry. 
Barbara Fair, a long-time organizer with 
·· 
People Against Injustice who first got in-
volved in criminal justice activism when 
her brother was incarcerated 
in a prison 
system, she says, that "neither of us really 
understood" 
insists that "the only thing 
that is 'non-profit' about most non-profits 
is the pay that direct service providers:-
the real workers 
receive." Fair sees the 
entire system, non-profits included, as 
fundamentally corrupt. "Incarceration is a 
huge business," she says. "[It is] the fastest-
growing, most recession-proof industry in 
America today, and it is so huge that stock 
investments are available. Because it is a 
huge business, there is no incentive to de-
incarcerate because empty cells lead to loss 
on the stock market and loss in jobs for 
thousands who might otherwise be unem-
ployed or unemployable." 


Matos is aware that many activists 
share Fair's cynicism, but she remains 
optimistic about large-scale grassroots co-
operation. "The overwhelming consensus 
Prisoners released into New Haven are disqualified from public housing in buildings such as Westville Manor, often leaving them with nowhere to go. 


Politics in Hartford's capitol building have prevented the legislature and community groups alike from alleviating the strain a steady stream of released pris-
oners has placed on New Haven . 


from community-based organizations," 
she explains, "is that the city does have a 
major role to play, and we want to bring 
everyone to the table." Matos, along with 
Joughin and other community organizers, 
currently hopes to garner support for New 
Haven's new "Ban the Box" campaign to 
officially remove questions about criminal 
history from preliminary job applications. 
"We think it would be better if that sub-
ject came up later in the interview pro-
cess," Matos says. Her pilot proposal for 
the Re-entry Initiative explains that the 
"Ban the Box" project would help inmates 
rejoin the workforce. This program would 
include outreach to local businesses to in-
crease awareness of the Work Opportunity 
Tax Credit, a federal tax incentive for em-
ployers to hire ex-felons. 


IN FOCUSING ON THE EXCHANGE of infor-
-
mation, Matos has found an innovative so-
lution to the biggest sticking point in the 
re-entry debate. While Lawlor, DeStefano, 
and Rell battle endlessly over funding-
"Governor Rell just doesn't want to fund 
these programs," Lawlor complains, even 
though ~'the Department of Corrections 
ran $19 million over budget in _2007 and 
is expected to run $24 I)lillion over budget 
this year" 
Matos emphasizes that many 
of the city's initial programs will be "non- · 
resource heavy." By focusing on informa-
tion, outreach, and streamlining, Matos 
has created a program that requires little 
funding. 


But she has not given up hope for 
significant improvement in the degree 
of state-level support for New Haven in-
mates. In the past few years, both she and 
Lawlor are quick to note, the DOC has 
adopted a more enlightened view of pris-
oner re-entry. "They seem very much on 
board with working together," Matos ex-
plains. "We've had some very productive 
discussions." 


In focusing on the exchange of 
information:~ Matos has found 
an innovative solution to the 
biggest sticking point in the 
re-entry debate: 
nding. 


Brian Garnett, a DOC spokesperson, 
emphasizes that, since 2003, when a new 
commissioner came on board, the Depart-
ment has made significant improvements 
. to encourage re-entry. "The old way of 
doing corrections," Garnett explains, "was 
showing an offender the front door on 
their last day of incarceration and waving 
goodbye 
that doesn't work and it isn't 
good for public safety." He points out that 
since · 2003, the DOC has doubled the 
number of halfway house beds in Con-
necticut to 1,200 and significantly stepped 
up re-entry preparation during incarcera-
tion. "From day one we are planning for 
releasing an offender back into society," he 
says. 


Both he and Lawlor also mention that 
Connecticut's prison system is still "in a 
much better place" than those of many 
other states 
it is one of only a handful of 
states, according to a recent, highly publi-
cized Pew study of national incarceration 
trends, whose incarcerated population has 
not grown over the last three years. States 
like California and Florida face re-entry . 
and recidivism crises of a much higher · 
degree. 


Despite these promising steps, how-
ever, the DOC and Governor Rell remain 
locked in disagreement with New Haven 
reformers over the extent to which the 
present system is broken. While almost 
every state and local representative in New 
Haven insists that more re-entry funding 
is needed, Garnett avers that "Governor 
Rell's support has been more than suffi-
cient 
we do not need any more money." 


And while Garnett merely points out that 
Connecticut's overall reconviction rate of 
40 percent drops to 24 percent when pris-
oners are released under the close super-
vision of parole officers, Lawlor is actively 
pursuing funding to hire new parole offi-
cers so that existing officers can work more 
effectively. 


Garnett also flatly denies DeStefano's 
charge of state prisoner "dumping" in New 
Haven. "We are not dumping anybody 
anywhere," he explains in language remi-
niscent of Rell's March letter to DeSte-
fano. "We are simply returning people to 
their homes. People want to go horne after 
they are released and that is where we take 
them." Though, in the summary of her 
pilot program, Matos included interviews 
with prisoners from around the state who 
were dropped in New Haven rather than 
their hometowns, Garnett classifies these 
". 
" 
accounts as JUSt maccurate. 


The question of their origin aside, no 
one denies that ex-convicts are streaming 
into New Haven at a steady rate and that 
they can't be helping the city's already-epic 
battle with crime and violence. But while · 
Matos continues to search for common 
ground between community groups and 
political opponents, the core controversy 
between reformers and the status quo re-
mams. 


"Both Democrats and Republicans fa-
miliar with the issue realize that you're go-
ing to have to spend this money one way 
or another," Lawlor explains. "It's just a 
matter of whether you want to spend less 
now on re-entry, or more later on new 
, 
pnsons.
