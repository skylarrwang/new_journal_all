just doing it for you, but for others." 
IN HIGH SCHOOL, Jenna Felici ES '08 was 
one of those "others". "It was difficult to 
start coming to the church at Yale, because 
no one here could have guessed that I had 
just joined the Mormon Church eight 
months earlier," she says. "I hadn't gone to 
church my whole life." 

With a Catholic father and a mother 
who had lapsed from Mormonism because 
of her husband's opposition to it, Felici 
followed her parents to churches of a host 
of different denominations, but says that 
it was only when she attended a Mormon 
church with her maternal grandparents 
. 
that she felt "something special.'J She be- · 
gan meeting with missionaries and think-
ing about joining the Church. Because of 
her father's disapproval, she had to sneak 
out of her house at 5:50 a.m., before her -
·parents awoke, to attend 6 a.m. seminary 
classes at the local Mormon church. 

At the end of high school, Felici was 
baptized with her family 
father includ-
ed 
in attendance. When she started her 
freshman year at Yale, she knew .she want-
ed to serve a mission herself, which she 
has now scheduled for · December 2008, 
before she will attend medical school. She 
is working full-time as a medical assistant 
in a dermatology clinic, and because her 
parents won't contribute to her· mission-
ary stipend, families in Felici's home ward 
have offered to make up the difference. 

"In some ways, I'm like the people I will 
teach 
they, too, may have families telling 
them it's wrong," she says. "It helps when 
someone has experienced the same thing 
as you. It gives people hope. Some people 
might take my words differently, because I 
made that choice for mysel£" 

THAYNE · STODDARD, who will leave 'next 
summer to b~gin his mission, has strug-
gled with his faith in the past and does not 
share Felici's confidence in proselytizing. 

"I don't know how to share my own be-
liefs without forcing them down peoples' 
throats, which I absolutely do not want," 
he says. "I love the Church and would love 
to share my faith, but I don't think I have 
the right as a person to believe that my 
Church is the only right Church." 

Stoddard says he can hope only to ex-
pose himself to others' faiths 
and oth-
ers to Mormonism 
in a positive way 
throughout the course of his mission. "My 
concerns have been put to rest by the ba-
sic principle of faith, and the belief that 
my family and I will be taken care of," he 
says. 

Swett, for his part, found that changing 
himself was just as important as chang-
ing others. His experience with one fam-
ily whom he met during the second year 
of his mission particularly affected him. 
. He visited their house two or three times 
a week over the course of seven months. 

"They really opened their home to me," 
. he says. "It was the closest I have ever felt 
to being in a family other than my own." 
Both parents and all three daughters were 
baptized, which he describes as the proto-
typical mission success, but "that wasn't 
what mattered" for Swett. 

What did matter was that he felt a de-
gree of responsibility toward the family. 
They had made drastic changes in their 
lives in order to join the Church, giving up 
coffee and wine and paying tithes. "Most 
of all, I felt a responsibility to teach only 
things I felt a personal testimony about," 
he says, "because I believe in an afterlife 
and that these things will someday mat-
ter. , 

What also mattered was a feeling Swett 
experienced one day in their kitchen before 
their baptisms. He found himself humbled 
by this family, humbled at the thought of 
teaching them about religion. ''As a family, 
they already embodied the love and good-
ness that God wants," he says. "Who was I 
to be teaching them?"

It's 1:45 p.m. on a Wednesday afternoon, 
and Alexis Wilcox is leading twelve high-
schoolers balancing five-pound medicine 
balls in their hands up a large hill. Stu-
dents who'd rather play hooky than suffer 
the haul may find themselves making a 6 . 
a.m. "sunrise hike" the next morning 
no 
student in Ms. Wilcox's class gets away 
without making up for an absence. She 
tolerates neither tardiness nor poor disci-
pline. Each student has exactly three min-
utes to get dressed in athletic clothes, and 
even the slightest infraction is punished. 

At the beginning of each academic year, 
Ms. Wilcox's students sign a contract in-
cluding the key clause: "YOU WILL BE-
HAVE." Needless to say, Wilcox is serious 
about her course iri Physical Education at 
Common Ground Charter High School, 
but that doesn't faze senior Latelia Bunch, 
who insists that her authoritarian teacher 
is "a really cool person." As Bunch ex-
plains, "It's really intense. Whether it's rain 
or shine, you're going outside." 

Wilcox is exhibit A for charter school 
advocates who see schools like Common 
September 2008 

Ground as an exciting new approach to 
public education, sanctioned and paid for 
by the public school system but free of its 
bureaucratic hurdles. Smaller than regular 
public schools and run by a "governing 
board" of teachers, parents, and adminis-
tJ~tors, charter schools were initially con-
ceived as a solution to educational under-
performance in public schools. Connecti-
cut adopted charter legislation in 1997 _ ~ 
and has since built 18 charter schools 
throughout the state, three of them in 
New Haven. 

Common Ground's unconventional 
ethos, which could never be supported 
in a regular public school, centers on an 
expansive definition of the word "environ-
mentalism." Oliver Barton, the school's 
founding director, explains that Common 
Ground's approach to nature "isn't nec-
essarily forestry or global warming, but 
using the local community and physical 
environment as a classroom for teach-
ing." Although teachers still tailor classes 
to state testing standards, the curriculum 
at Common Ground is designed to spur 
~ ·.-

"\:· 
both environmental consciousness and a 
commitment to the city in which its stu-
dents live. 


"We're talking about the place," says 
Joel Tolman, who has taught history and 
social studies at Common Ground for five 
years. "New Haven is an incredibly rich 
learning community, and our students can · 
explore it on the city buses." So while oth-
er New Haven students study geometry, 
Common Ground's pupils map the angles 
of architecture throughout the city. In-
stead of a cut-and-dry biology· Class, they 
take a class in biodiversity, plotting local 
data on charts and graphic models. 

Common Ground's approach 
to nature ''isn't necessarily for-
estry or global warming, "Bar-
ton explains, "but using the 
local community and physical 
a classroom 
environment as 
for teaching. " 


Though reputed among New Haven 
youth as "the school where kids chase 
chickens all day," Common Ground stu-
dents don't just plant strawberries and dig 
up potatoes for credit (though both garden 
tasks are part of the curriculum). The cur-
riculum .is rigorous enough that 90 percent 
of the school's graduating class matricu-
lates to college: 

The high-achieving nature of the Com-
mon Ground student body should not be 
surprising, given that the school, like many 
of its charter cousins, . was planned and 
founded by teachers. As Barton explains, 
the Connecticut school board wasn't al-
ways enthusiastic about their plans, and 
it was difficult to sell the program to kids 
who had never been hiking before. By 
February of 1997, though, the board had 
come around and approved the proposal 
for Common Ground. Seven months later, 
the school opened its doors. "It was like 
building an airplane while you're flying 
it," Barton recalls. "But it was an exciting 
plane to be flying. We were living on raw 
" 
energy. 

That energy continues to . drive Com-
mon Ground's. unusually dedicated facul-
ty. Because the school runs itself with little 
interference from the State, its survival de-
pends on the above-and-beyond efforts of 
teachers like Wilcox and Tolman. Though 
the average Common Ground teacher 
makes over five thousand dollars less each 
year than other New Haven teachers, the 
school's faculty and staff pride themselves 
on knowing the name of every student in 
school by the third week of classes. Some 
take on other responsibilities as well, such 
as leading extracurricular. programs, help-
ing out with administrative paperwork, or 
participating in public outreach: A few of-
fer job training to students or work at the 
school's summer camp. Others help match 
students to social services around the city. 

Each year, teachers run a commencement 
ceremony called "Step-Up," during which 
they tell personalized stories about each -
. graduate. And that hard work seems to pay 
off as one student says, "You can talk to a 
teacher like they're your friend." 

These unusual faculty members are at-
tracted, in part, by Common Ground's 
unique history and alternative mission. 
Ten years ago, the West Rock park in 
which Common Ground now stands was 
a trash-heap, a makeshift dump when the 
nearby Hamden Waste and Recycling Fa-
cility was closed. The park authority was 
eager for change and welcomed Common 
Ground's plans. Early on, "part of our 
work was just making the park a useable 
space again," explains Barton. 

Yet even with an innovative curricu-
lum, involved faculty, and an apparently 
. happy student body 
"it gives you some-
thing normal public schools couldn't give 
·. you," notes Bunch, a senior 
Common 
Ground and its fellow charter schools are 
not without their critics. Stephen T. Cas-
sano, the former mayor of Manchester and 
a prominent member of the Connecticut 
Coalition for Justice in Education Fund-
ing ( CCJEF), claims that charter schools 
are merely private schools usurping public 
school funding. "Unfortunately, educatio~ 
spending remains a zero-sum game, and 
charter school gains mean further public 
school losses," CCJEF stated in a 2006 
testimony to the Connecticut Education 
Committee. Cassano faults charter schools 
Common Ground students garden, hatch chickens, and hike for credit.
