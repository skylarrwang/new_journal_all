EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Yale's best annual traditions are meant to 
be seen: the Game, the Safety Dance, the 
reopening of a newly renovated Residen-
tial College. What's not meant to be seen 
are the screw-ups: the how-could-I-have-
done-that expression after a fumble, the 
lights drunkenly flipped on in Commons, 
or 
and this is the nightmare scenario . a · 
move-in day at Jonathan Edwards with 
fewer beds than students angling to sleep 
in them. 

"I don't think any college has been as 
far behind as JE," says the college's master, 
Gary Haller, of the much-delayed renova-
tion. "Certainly no college has been forced 
not to house some of its students." Fifteen 
students, to be exact, are currently holed 
up in style at the Omni hotel, courtesy 
of Yale's pocketbook, while construction 
crews render their intended rooms in JE's 
Weir Hall habitable. 

The cause of this administrative disaster 
is simple enough: triage. Either the college 
was to have no functioning servery, kitch-
en, or dining hall in time for its freshman 
banquet on September 1, or it was to be 
unable to house some of its students. The 
University chose the latter. It was forced to 
make that decision in the first place, how-
September 2008 
ever, because the college's renovation had 
just barely righted itself from the brink of 
a full-fledged catastrophe. 

The problems at Jonathan Edwards be-
gan shortly after its fifteen-month renova-
tion began, during the project's ripping-up 
and gutting-out phase. Tearing apart old 
walls often reveals structural problems that 
aren't apparent at the outset of a renova-
tion. While cutting into JE's seventy-year-
old terracotta tiles, Yale's construction 
crew ran into constant difficulties. "There 
was a tremendous amount of demolition 
that had to be done," says Tim Galvin, 
the project manager at William A. Berry 
& Son, the private contractor that over-
saw the project's implementation. "Many 
times the actual conditions were different 
from what the design team may have an-
ticipated." Again and again, Galvin was 
forced to return to Yale's architects at Her-
bert S. Newman & Partners to ask them to 
revise their designs. 

Alex Mackenzie, who runs the paint-
ing subcontractor working on the site, 
contrasts the JE job with his experience 
working on the 2006 renovation of Sil-
liman College. "In my opinion," he says, 
"the JE building seemed older, and there's 
a lot more issues we ran into." 

Demolition was initially supposed to 
have been completed, and reconstruction 
well underway, by December. But Galvin, 
Yale's Construction Manager David Cripe, 
and the project's architects were still trou-
bleshooting the deconstruction a month 
later. "It's not a new observation, the fact 
that we're behind schedule," Haller noted 
a week before the college reopened. "It's 
been dear since January of this year." De-
molition wasn't fully completed until Feb-
ruary, causing a further spiral of delays. 

"The demolition went q~ longer than 
what had originally been planned," Galvin 
concedes. ''And any time the demolition is 
continuing, the design can't be finalized. 
Then certain materials had to be ordered 
later than you originally anticipated." 

The project didn't kick into crisis mode 
until the weeks surrounding Commence-
ment, when, after a few attempts to play 
catch-up, work remained two months be-
hind schedule. Yale has no "Plan B" in case 
a college renovation prohibitively spills 
over into the fall. JE students cannot be 
moved back into Swing Spac.e, which will 
already be crawling with Calhoun refugees 
by September, and four hundred beds at

our guys up to 18 or twenty guys." While 
trators would be loath to make. "The end 
a little overtime in a bad economy is a 
date can't move," says Galvin plainly. "Ev~ 
blessing, too much is "pretty inefficient, to 
erybody woke up when they realized things 
be honest with you," says Masucci. Several 
weren't going to happen, and things got a 
subcontractors quietly point fingers at the . 
little more hectic," says Anthony Masucci, 
front end of the project;, from the derelict 
the project manager at Enterprise, the ren-
designers to the demolition delays. 

The two-month overtime marathon al-
layed fears that the college would be un-
usable come September, but the schedul-
ing gap was still closed by only a month. 

"The project team was acting to minimize 
any impact to the students at the start of 
school," says Tom Conroy, a spokesperson 
for the Univ~rsity. This meant that, in or-
der to move students in, work had to be 
stopped cold on some portions of the base-
ment, the faculty offices, and Weir Hall 
while all resources were devoted to finish-
ing the bulk of the residences and the din-
ing complex. The abandoned areas will be 
finished in two phases, the first scheduled 
to conclude by September 19 and the sec-
ond by October 17. 

Even so, a few corners had to be cut to 
make it to the finish line. "The symme-
try of the ceiling and the lighting fixture 
[is off], the links should be matched and 
they're not," says Haller, blaming a con-
struction error. "There was a choice, either 
go back and take it all out and put it all in 
again, and have the servery not open, or 
have slight modifications. I'm convinced 
that nobody who doesn't know what the 
problem was will even notice a difference." 

Sod was laid down in the courtyard only 
days before studen~s arrived, and JE stu-
dents will have to endure construction in 
their college for at least six weeks after they 
have moved in. 

Yale has no "Plan B" in case 
a college renovation prohibi-
tively spills over into the all 

The most notable victims of the delays, 
of course, are the Omni fifteen. But Lesley 
Kiger' 10, a field hockey player exiled from 
her suite for the time being, is keenly aware 
of the perks. "Living in the Omni definite-
ly has its benefits!" she writes in an email. 
"King-size bed, air conditioning, wireless, 
big television. We even get chocolates on 
our pillow!" Haller has also assured that all 
students living in the Omni will have sin-
gle rooms and have their clothes laundered 
on the University's tab. The hotel's isola-
tion, however, is what makes Kiger most 
eager to return to her college. Hiking to 
team practice shortly after dawn is an or-
deal, and "it's really lonely and lacking the 
residential college atmosphere. My room 
is on the same floor as my suitemates' but 
is not near them and not connected by a 
common room," she explains. 

For its part, Yale has kept mum about 
its reported frustration with the contrac-
tors for letting this mess get out of hand. 
The University has worked with Galvin's 
crew before on Science Hill, and Jerry 
Warren, the former associate vice president 
for Construction and Renovation, selected 
him again. But there is still some audible 
grumbling. "They have, of course, tried to 
make me happy in every way," says Haller. 
"But there's certain things they can't do. 
They can't get all the students in. They do 
things they're not supposed to. They can't 
deliver what they need to deliver, which is 
a completed college."
