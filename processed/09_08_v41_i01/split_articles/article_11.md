FRAMING OF THE SHREW 
On a cloudy Friday morning at the Peabody Museum of Natural History, Beatrice Babbs is feeding two giant elephant 
shrews their first meal of the day. A pair 
of brothers named Makya and Bindi, the 
shrews scamper around the leaf litter lining their glass cage as Babbs, a full-time 
assistant at the Peabody, tosses them meal-
worms. "In the morning," she explains, 
"they get the worms, and we toss them 
crickets in the afternoons." The brothers' 
diet is supplemented throughout the day 
by a metal dish of diced apples and dried 
6 
catfood sprinkled with peanut oil. Luckily, 
Babbs is not the only one responsible for 
the upkeep of these picky eaters. 

Jim Sirch also cares about elephant 
shrews. As Babbs' supervisor and the primary caretaker of Makya and Bindi, he 
coordinated the year-long loan of the endangered pair from Smithsonian's National 
Zoo in Washington, D.C. Makya and 
Bindi star in "Travels in the Tree of Life," 
a temporary exhibit based upon two words 
the non-premeds among us have probably forgotten from some long-ago biology 
class: genomics (the study of organisms 
in terms of their DNA) and phylogeny 
(the evolutionary history of a species). The 
exhibit aims to demonstrate the interconnectedness of all life forms, revealing some 
surprising interspecies links along the 
way. Though elephant shrews are neither 
elephants nor shrews, Sirch says, they are 
distantly related to the elephant through 
a common ancestor of the superorder Afrotheria, which evolved out of Africa about 
100 million years ago. 

Sirch, a tall man with a salt and pepper 
moustache that gives him the authoritative 
air of an Ivy League professor crossed with 
the host of a home improvement show, 
says that there are 16 known species of elephant shrews in the world. Weighing in 
at roughly one pound each, Makya and 
Bindi's clan of Black and Rufous Giant Elephant Shrews were known as the largest 
of these miniature creatures until recently, 
when an even larger species weighing in at 
one and one-third pounds dwarfed them 
• in status. 

Originally from the forests of Eastern 
Tanzania, elephant shrews are now endangered due to both habitat loss and their 
status as the favored bushmeat of the indigenous population. Only in the past ten 
years have they been kept in captivity, and, 
besides the Peabody, zoos in Philadelphia 
and Denver are the only other places in 
the country where the long-snouted, naked-tailed, speedy-legged creatures can be 
found. Their bizarre appearance and rare 
status has bred some confusion among visitors. Sirch, officially the Peabody Education Coordinator, mourns the inaccuracy 
with which Makya and Bindi are often 
identified. "A lot of kids will come over 
and say: 'Look at the anteaters!'" he says. 
"And this one elderly man who came into 
the exhibit stubbornly insisted that he was 
looking at a pair of opossums." 

This is not the first live animal exhibit to grace the Peabody's diorama and taxidermy-filled halls. In 2004, the museum housed a family of cuttlefish in a 
five-hundred-gallon marine tank as part 
of the "In Search of the Giant Squid" exhibit. Before that, it played host to a litter 
of emu chicks in the Great Hall, placing 
the fledgling birds next to a reconstructed 
Stegosaurus skeleton to emphasize their 
· evolutionary link. ("Most paleontologists 
believe that birds are directly descended 
from dinosaurs," Sirch explains). And if all 
· goes according to plan, the brothers won't 
be the last live residents of the Peabody. As 
their year-long tenure approaches its end, 
Makya and Bindi will have to make room 
for the next exotic species to crawl to the 
museum: Babbs, Sirch, and the rest of the 
Peabody staff are currently installing a new 
glass enclosure for an upcoming exhibit of 
tropical leaf-cutter ants.
