Backstage, Jason Weinberger (CC '96, MUS '97) walked past me nervously as he hurried to warm up for his clarinet performance. I knew him as the charismatic conductor of the Jonathan Edwards Chamber Orchestra. Now an assisrant conductor for the Yale Symphony Orchestra (YSO), Weinberger took the stage of Sprague Memorial Hall for his recital, a requirement for his master's degree in music. His body swayed to Max Reger's Sonata in f minor, Op. 49, No.2. 

I had never heard of Max Reger. 

Weinberger was also going to perform a piece by the relatively unknown Alban Berg. 

Weinberger relished the chance to introduce more obscure classical pieces to people who probably would not otherwise have heard them. 

He had realized an odd duality about classical music at Yale. He stood atop a stage at times graced by the Tokyo String Quartet, in a city rich with a classical music tradition. Yet even in such an environment, most graduate and faculty concerts are poorly attended by undergraduates. Weinberger had exerted great effort to yield the 60-plus turnout. He and other classical musicians must find creative ways to attract tindergraduates willing to listen to more than Beethoven's Fifth. 

Yale both is and is not part of a downward trend in classical music. Faculty concerts are attended primarily by older New Haven residents. On the other hand, Yale Music Professor Craig Wright (Hon. MA '81) said Yale is probably the only university in the United States where an undergraduate symphony will have higher attendance than a basketball game. Yet Wright still fears that classical music is becoming less popular, especially among younger people. "The audience," Wright said, "keeps getting older and older." His music appreciation course is an attempt to revive interest in classical music among college students. 

The YSO concert most heavily attended by undergraduates is the Halloween concert, which often features a homemade movie, live acting, and popular music. Lisa Shufro (BK FEBRUARY 14, 1997 '95) recalled, "The bulk of the audience at other Yale Symphony concerts are not Yale students." In contrast, she described the orchestra's treatment when they played in Portugal for their 1995 spring trip. "Those people treated us like we were movie stars," she said. "Just-Please! autograph my program," university students there would beg her. This year, the orchestra has put forth an extra effort to attract undergraduates and has successfully drawn more students, YSO Manager Laurie Ongley said. 

The Yale-New Haven area follows a national trend in which rock music leads the popularity charts and classical music lags behind. 

One solution may be for classical musicians to perform repertoires that mix more popular pieces with less younger audiences. For one of Weinberger's chamber orchestra performances, psychology pro-fessor Peter Salovey narrated Sergei Prokofiev's "Peter and the Wolf." Weinberger then seized the chance to play one of Prokofiev's less popular works to the same audience. 

The classical music world at Yale is fighting a battle to stay within the bounds of mainstream culture. This struggle has meaning for Wright because of music's special place among the arts. "People have a universally more visceral, pro or con, response to music than to any of the other arts," he said. 

So what is at stake in the battle to save classical music other than the spiritual and aesthetic? "What else could there be?" Wright asked in return. "That's the very essence of life."
