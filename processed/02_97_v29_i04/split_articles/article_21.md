bunch of fraternity brothers I didn't 
know. I felt I could go only after I had 
convinced two friends, Steve and Aaron, 
to come along. Although they do not 
frequent frat· parties, they had a history 
with Yale fraternities. They once 
infiltrated a rush event at Dakota J's by 
dressing in baseball caps and flannel 
shirts. Inside they ate free wings and 
drank free p itchers until they were 
suspected as impostors, at which point 
they quickly left the restaurant. Even in 
this fearless company, I had to drink a 
couple of shots of gin to bolster my 
courage before I left my room. 

Steve, Aaron, and I paid our $3 at the 
door and a younger frat brother drew a 
circle and a dot on the backs of each of 
our hands with a yellow highlighter 
marker. The marks bewildered us. We 
joked that the symbols might be secret 
code for the rest of the brothers: 
"Outsiders-kill on sight." 

Another brother pointed us down the 
stairs towards the basement. "You don't

know what's down there," he said. I took 
the comment as a warning. 

To match the black light theme of the 
party, Jimi Hendrix's "Purple Haze" and 
other late-1960s psychedelic hits were 
piped into the basement. At first I could 
only make out the silhouettes of people in 
the unnatural light. Suddenly, h uge, 
glowing block letters jumped out of the 
darkness: "FOOTBALL." As my eyes 
adjusted, I saw the equally large guy who 
wore these letters on the back of h is 
jacket. 

The black lights obscured the faces I 
passed in the crowd. Skin was dark 
purple; the whites of the eyes and teeth 
shone a pearly yellow. If I did know 
someone there, I would not have been 
able to recognize him or her. I saw a 
white baseball cap on nearly every male 
head, usually turned backwards. Along 
with cheap beer, the bar served live 
goldfish to be gulped from shot glasses. 
The bartender boasted that he had already 
swallowed eight. 

Steve, Aaron, and I formed a little ~ 
cluster in the middle of the crowd. I~ 
scanned faces for someone I knew, but~ 
this time people were already too~ 
engrossed in each other even to notice us. ~ 
We had no idea what was going o n .~· 
Mostly, we talked amongst ourselves and ~ 
admired our plastic cups that glowed a ~ 
bright orange.

The stereotypes I exp ected were g 
confirmed. These markers-the hats, the ~ 
jackets, the goldfish-were a language I -
didn't understand, cues to one another as 
to whether the individuals at the party 
actually belonged. And, in our inability to 
communicate, it was obvious that we did 
not. 

Ignored by the rest of the party for 45 
minutes, the three of us decided it was 
time to leave. On the way out, I asked 
one of the brothers if this party was 
smaller than normal. He told me no. I 
asked him if he thought most undergrads 
came to these parties. He told me no. I 
then asked him where he thought the rest
