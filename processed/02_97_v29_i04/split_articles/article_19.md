his friends had time for movies during the 
holiday season. Afterwards he walked to 
Malley's department store to shop for 
presents. What he wanted most for 
Christmas that year was a television set. 
Big AI sensed that everyone was getting 
them in those days. And he was right. 
Within eight years, almost 90 percent of 
New Haven households would have a 
working set.


Following Big Al's directions to the 
old College Theater, my friend 
Andrew and I bolt down Chapel 
Street, pausing once in my room to get a 
flashlight, a tape recorder, and some rope. 
Excited by the spirit of adventure, we take 
some steadying shots of whiskey to help 
us get past the imposing "No Trespassing" 
signs. Embarking on what promises to be 
an intrepid historical excavation, we force 
our way into the old theater. It is no easy 
task; at moments the danger and fright 
are enough to warrant our hushed tones. 
Since the building receives little sunlight 
during the day, the temperature inside the 
College hovers several degrees below 
freezing at night. A thin sheet of ice 
covers all exposed surfaces, making 
climbing over piles of rusted metal, fallen 
bricks, and chunks of plaster molding 
genuinely treacherous. When we finally 
reach the center of the crumbling shell, 
Andrew and I are covered in dirt, 
cobwebs, and strands of red curtain. The 
flashlight's thin, watery beam only 
permits glimpses of twisted metal shapes 
hanging ominously from the ceiling and 
overturned seats impeding our path, their 
cushions rotting with mold and moisture. 
Even in the dark, the great silver screen, 
now faded off-white with a fine dusting 
of din and soot, dominates our view. It's 
center has been cut away in jagged strips. 
Andrew says, "I have nightmares about 
spaces like this. " Silence. Beat, beat. 
Silence. The flutter of wings in the rafters 
sets us on our toes, and a lone pigeon's 
coo is enough to eject us from the 
building, running and screaming and 
laughing.


When I return the next day, I am both 
surprised and disappointed. There is 
light, and I am alone. Instead of catching 
only patches of decay, the entire 
enormous space opens to me. The theater 
is far larger than I expected, far more 
impressive in scope and mass. But after 
my initial awe passes, I only notice the 
empty beer cans, candy bar wrappers, 
flattened Kodak film boxes, and plastic 
grocery bags that litter the floor. After a 
casual inspection, I note that both the 
seat cushions and the curtains are made of 
maroon polyester cloth, not red velvet. 
One wall is papered with a pattern that 
resembles a Wonder Bread bag, all candy-
colored circles on a white plane. Surely, 
this could not be the theater of Big Al's 
memories? That, that's some other 
theater, I think.


The history of movie theaters in 
New Haven is as fleeting as a series 
of images projected on a screen; 
there's no substance to it, no depth. It 
can't be found in the tangible artifacts. It's 
not in the architecture, the photographs, 
or the history books. Big AI and 
Dorothea tint their recollections with 
nostalgia and bitterness. If you want facts, 
you can't trust their tales. The films 
themselves are all available on videotape, 
but what good are they without the 
crowds, trolley cars, and soda fountains? 
What's worse is that the city's busy streets 
conspire to keep the College hidden, to 
conceal from view what should be its 
looming presence over the downtown 
landscape. A_ person might attend Yale for 
four years and everyday walk down 
Chapel Street to buy a paper at 
NewsHaven and a cup of coffee at 
Willoughby's. Everyday this person could 
pass both the College Theater hidden 
behind the Union League Cafe and the 
deserted lot behind Laura Ashley where 
the Roger Sherman RKO stands, and he 
would never know either place existed. 
A culture that is primarily visual 
leaves no trace of its passage. It is 
unrecordable. Knowing this, it's still 
possible to get fragments of narratives, to 
imagine a grander architecture from the 
imprints of a crumbling building, and to 
reconstruct a small look at the past-
albeit inevitably colored by the present, 
by nostalgia and television and regret. li31
