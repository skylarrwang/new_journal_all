hyperlink zipped me to a sire called The 14-Word Press, a place~ 
devoted entirely to the glorification of 14 words credited to a !!?. 
man named David Lane. The 14 words were: " wE MUST SECURE 
THE EXISTENCE OF OUR PEOPLE AND A FUTURE FOR WHITE 
CHILDREN. " I clicked my way back to the Skinheads page and 
foUowed a different link, this one whisking me away to a web 
page called Heroes of the White Race. "The time is now to learn
