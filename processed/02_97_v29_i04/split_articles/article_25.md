i, it's Merritt.· We're at Aladdin. I swear to God 
if you don't show up in one second-I'm sitting 
here rallying the troops, I'm working on 'em, 
but they're fading fast and I swea-l'm holding 
down the fort. You've got to come. It's been like forty minutes. 
You've got to arrive, you've got to arrive. We need the car we need 
the people we need to get in we need the energy. We need you to 
arrive. We're at Aladdin. We're waiting we're waiting it's freezing 
we're waiting. I'll see you soon. I know you won't abandon us." 
Merritt hands the cellular phone back to the man who lent it 
to her. It is 2:30 a.m., early Saturday morning, Crown Street, New 
Haven. The line for last-minute orders stretches the length of 
Aladdin's single, fluorescendy-lit room. Cold and constant rain 
interrupts our view through the restaurant's sheetglass display 
window. Merritt stomps her patent-leather-booted heel 
Ci impatiently, checking first her watch and then the street outside. 
§ She tightens the wrap of her coat and walks into the street to wait

~ have been once, or who regularly make this pilgrimage.

We press on, shedding exit after exit, insistent rain flying from 
l; the windshield. Conversation in the car establishes that Foxwoods 
~ is indeed the largest casino in the world, employer of 10,000 and 
&. home of 3, 100 slot machines and 234 tables. The Mashantucket 
Foxwoods Casino brings both dollars and 
destitution to Southern Connecticut. 

Pequots have been raking in vast sums of money since they built 
the casino in 1992: estimates range fro·m $400 rrullion to $1 
billion annually. The Pequots give up $ 100 million a year to keep 
the state coffers full, and maintain the reservation's monopoly on 
gambling. We pass New London, Groton, Mystic, and turn off the 
interstate. 

I remember the last time I took this road to Ledyard. I was on 
a bus on my way to Providence. It was March, late at night, a 
blizzard. Every seat on the Greyhound was claimed. Plastic bags 
full of food and liters of Coke cluttered the aisle. I dosed my eyes 
and listened to the two sweatsuited, middle-aged women across 
from me complaining about their husbands and their bad luck at 
tb.e slots. I tried for a while to follow the loudly-voiced free 
associations of a deranged man a few rows behind me. I fell asleep. 
When I woke, it was to bright light and a woman's voice 
coming through a megaphone. "You are now at portal six. A bus 
will be here to meet you at 7:00 a.m. Please pick up a map as you 
exit the bus. Welcome to Foxwoods. Good luck." The bus drained 
of all but two or three passengers. As we pulled away, out of the 
parking lot and back towards the highway, I began to grasp the 
sheer size of the place. Snow accumulating on the ground reflected 
the pinks and purples of the light murals on the building's flank. 
Massive sculptures were stained a ·garish, otherworldly hue. 
}J
proaching Foxwoods, this time aware that it is my 
destination, I still can't quite believe my eyes. "It goes on 
or miles," says a voice from the backseat. Even from this 
distance-stili on the road, the complex far away-1 can't discern 

the casino's perimeters. 

The first thing we do when we pass through the glass door 
and ascend the wide flight of stairs is stop at the cash machine. It 
spits out $100 bills. A man with a walkie-talkie and a green suit 
checks our IDs and gives us each a map. The six of us in all-black 
regalia move past him into the casino. There does not seem to be 
a norm here; no one even looks twice at our boots and boas and 
leather jackets. I have nothing with which co compare the space. 
All my metaphors fail me: a carnival factory? a petri dish of 
turquoise and chrome? Liberace's ear wax? 

A guard accompanies me across the carpeted floor to the 
coatcheck because the umbrella I carry is considered a weapon. 
She notices the dismay that settles on my face as we move deeper 
into the atrium, a stand of shivering, bleeping slot machines on 
our right, a field of blackjack and roulette tables on the left. We 
walk by a stretch of teller windows, where chips convert to money 
and cups filled with quarters are exchanged for bills. 
"This is slow for this time on a Friday night," she says. 
"There are usually more people here than this?" I ask. It's not 
what I'd call overcrowded. There are some unused slots, but most 
of the tables in this first room are occupied, and it's now 4:30 
a.m. 
"Oh, yeah. This is nothing." The guard makes a gesture, as if 
to conjure under her forearm's sweep a room teeming with 
gamblers. 
"How many people do you think can fir in here?" 
She looks at me wide-eyed, like I have asked how many atoms 
can fir on the head of a pin, or if she thinks the earth could just 
FEBRUARY !4· 1997 
be a speck of dust under a giant's fingernail. 
"I have no idea ... there's no way to tell." 

G 
adi walks away from the roulette table. I walk with Nick 
and him into the slot parlor. I feel like I have entered a 
Super Mario hell: the nonsensical inflection of beeping 
and the lights that flare without a stimulus. Gadi and Nick 
comment on the scene before them. 
"It's the irony of all the ringing bells and all the really sad 
people." 
"The worrying machinery ... " 
I recognize a couple sitting in here, side by side at the slots. 
The man wears grey camouflage pants and a purple sweatshirt, his 
belly a visible band of flesh. The woman's hair is tangled, long, 
unkempt. I saw her earlier, trailing behind him through the 
lobby. He looked angry. "You'll win it back, honey," she whined. 
They look meaner than before. We leave the slot parlor and walk 
down a wide empty hallway. 
"You could write a whole story about the Native American 
tragedy that's taking place right here," Gadi says. 
"Any Native Americans in sight?" Nick asks. "Not a one."
