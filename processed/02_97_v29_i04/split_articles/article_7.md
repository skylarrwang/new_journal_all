EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Popular culture resists definition. 

Popular culture is messy and residual. 

Popular culture is constantly on the move. 

Cultural critic Stuart suggests chat, in our ostensibly postmodern era, posrmodernism itself "is nor cultural epoch, at Tht Ntw journal believe that popular culture is, co use Hall 's metaphor, culture in the streets. It is the traffic of our daily lives and it is the road on which this traffic runs. We maneuver, take detours, stall, hotwire, fall asleep at the wheel, wake up with a jolt. The traffic is swift; popular culture blurs before our eyes. 

The articles in this issue attempt to map the cultural streets that lie beyond the classrooms and offices of Yale and New Haven. Popular culture surges forward at breakneck speeds, accelerating for the turn onto the highway of the twenty-first century. Despite this fin-tk-sieck rush, the essence of popular culture can still be glimpsed in the rearview muror. 

We at Tht Ntw journal were compelled to take to the roads of popular culture: out of our living rooms, beyond the sophisticated crudity of Tht Simpsons, the paranoid bewilderment of the X-Filrs, and the adolescent reminiscences of Party of Fivr. These television tidbits comprise predictable pares of mass media, but popular culture often occupies unexpected spaces-casinos, fraternities, crumbling movie houses, talk shows, and arcs festivals. 

The articles in chis issue can no more represent popular culture chan a series of pithy com-mentaries on prime-time television. Publishing a special issue, there is always the temptation, on the one hand, to be exhaustive in our coverage of the chosen topic. On the ocher hand, there is also the worry char the issue will simply become an encyclopedic taxonomy. Instead, we have located ourselves within the scenes of our everyday lives, and, consequently, we have found a place for ourselves in popular culture. These articles record our experiences with the stop-and-go narure of culture in the streets-the traffic jams, the collisions, the men at work. They expose, finally, a dilemma for the writer: poised between viewing and partici-pating, between policies and pleasure, he or she must be willing to embrace ambivalence.
