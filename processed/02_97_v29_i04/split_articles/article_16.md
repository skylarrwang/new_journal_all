**Talk Shows**

Talk shows are definitely a curiosity. One of the criticisms of talk shows is 
that they make the lowest, most extreme instances of lift seem 
commonplace. In a sense, that's what makes it interesting. I mean, most 
people are intrigued by a woman sleeping with 100 men in a year. I 
mean, it's kind of sick.

n New York City one day last winter, playing hooky from 
school, I found myself encircled by enormous photographs of 
Ricki Lake. She was everywhere, colonizing three of the four 
walls in the waiting room of the Ricki Lake Show. Her larger-
than-life smile flashed at me, her teeth dazzled an airbrushed white, 
her pastel clothes complemented her Slim-Fasted figure. Her iconic 
image soothed my truant's heart: my decision to skip "Edith 
Wharton and the Problem of America" had been the right one. 

About to enter the sound stage, I thought about the obstacles I 
had overcome to be within arm's reach of Riclci. My two friends and 
I maneuvered through a series of checkpoints before gaining 
entrance to the waiting room. On the street, we proved we were at 
least 18, and presented our fluorescent lime-green tickets for that 
day's episode. In the lobby, our names were checked against a master 
list of those who misbehaved on the show before: either by calking 
back to Riclci, using the strictly forbidden audio or video recording 
devices on the sound stage, or chewing gum while cameras were 
rolling. Riclci establishes her authority with the tender severity of a 
Victorian governess. 

My friends and I boarded the elevator and ascended to the final 
checkpoint. Stepping out of the elevator, I joined a line where guards 
checked my bags for weaponry, and my body was scanned by a metal 
detector. I hoped the knitting needles I was carrying would not 
alarm the guards. I wouldn't dream of harming Riclci in any way. 
Riclci's "Rules of Order" dictate that her authority not be questioned. 
So there I was, in the waiting room dominated by Ricki's image. 
I was disturbed. I had been thoroughly disarmed. While succumbing 
to Riclci's codes, I began to realize that being on a talk show, like 
participating in any cultural event, has an etiquette both formulaic 
and freaky in its idiom, an idiom both policing and populist in its 
ideology. 

Adoption of the etiquette, idiom, and ideology of talk-show 
culture is growing more common among Yale undergraduates. 
Leaving behind the study of mass media, students find themselves 
participating in the cultural practices they usually only talk about in
