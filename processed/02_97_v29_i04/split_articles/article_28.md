The look that takes over during exam period is just an extension of 
Yale's normal fashion sense. Students who choose Yale tend to 
take responsibility, regarding school and everything else, seriously. 
If my shopping habits are any indication, there's a link between 
being a conscientious student and being a conscientious spender. 
I can't imagine dropping hundreds of dollars to replace 
serviceable clothes any better than I can think of blowing off a 
final exam. 
But following that logic, a Yalie should look no different from 
any student at Harvard or Princeton. As any red-blooded Yalie 
knows, nothing could be further from the truth. People at 
Harvard seem to dress according to what they do: lit majors dress 
wear black and econ majors look like they're ready to take over 
the corner office at J. P. Morgan. The emphasis on appearance 
seems to be similar to the feeling we get that Cantabs care more 
about US. News and World Report rankings than we do. Similarly, 
a stroll around the Princeton campus feels like an adventure into 
a J. Crew catalog. But for YaJies, clothing seems to be less a 
uniform and more a way to look presentable while we're doing 
what we think is really important. We are passionate about what 
we are doing not because we think there's some type we need to 
fit, but because we are genuinely interested. 
And while for most Yalies this passion for their activities 
becomes a reason to neglect fashion, for a few among our student 
body, clothing is their passion. When fashion takes over it really

takes over, as it does for Hai-Ting Chinn (MUS '97). You've 
probably seen her walking around in her top hat, decked out in 
an outfit resembling that of an eighteenth-century boy. As she 
says, "The way I dress reflects my lifestyle. I want to live a life 
that's not part of this century." Her sister in spirit is Francesca 
Mymen (TO '98), who wears hand-sewn medievel garb. 
"Whenever we see each other, we have this feeling of complicity," 
Chinn says. 
Another woman who's often noticed for her unique sartorial 
tastes is Michelle Benitez (SY '00). She adheres to the Afro-
Carribbean religion Santeria, which requires initiates to dress in 
all-white for one year. For Benitez., attire reflects her most closely 
held beliefs. In their own way, these exceptions fit Yale's unique 
fashion rules: here, there are no rules.
