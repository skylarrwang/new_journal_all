<ii and biographies of Henry Ford, Rudolf 
~ Hess, and Heinrich Himmler. Another 
~ link took me to a place called the Nigger 
~ Joke Center. 
~ 
Back at the main page, I found a list 
~ of Internet Relay Chat (IRC) groups 
~ organized by skinheads, discussion centers 
<; where people meet to talk in real time. 
-~ "There are several great channels 
: 
established that you should enjoy 
~ visiting," it said. "The best channels are 
~ #skinheads, #nazi, #aryan, #whitepower, 
a.. #kkk, and #racial_identity. T he most 
popular being #nazi and #skinheads." I 
logged on to the IRC server, joined #nazi 
and waited as my screen went dark. 
Compared to the bright city-lights feel 
of the World Wide Web, the IRC is like 
sitting in an unlit room and conjuring 
disembodied spirits, hearing only voices in 
the dark but seeing nothing. The topic of 
conversation that evening was "Adolf 
Hitler was RJGHT!" I waited a few seconds. 
Then a flurry of white pixels appeared on 
my screen. 
<Skinhead> So, Jay, a Yale man eh? 
I was surprised he could tell where I 
was logging from. I typed a message back. 
<JOY> Yes. What about yourself, 
Skinhead? 
Mentioning Yale caught someone else's 
attention. 
<Bruderhof> Who goes to Yale? 
<Jay> I do. 
<Skinhead> Jay is 
dixit@morpheus.cis .yale.edu â€¢ Jay 
Dixit 
<Skinhead> are you wp Jay? 
<Jay> am I what? 
<Pillage> shheeeeesh 
<Skinhead> wp 
<Pillage> white power? 
<Skinhead> yeah 
<Jay> No. I'm just curious. 
<Bruderhof> Yale had no White Power 
when I was there. 
<Jay> B: you were at Yale? 
<Bruderhof> Jay: I went there for 1/2 
semester ... 
<Skinhead> is Yale a pretty liberal 
school? 
<Bruderhof> At New Haven Hospital. 
Yale SUCKS! Its even worse than 
harvard! 


<Skinhead> true 
<Jay> In some ways, yeah, it's very 
liberal. 
<Lyncher> Harvard~ Jewland 
<Bruderhof> harvard has more jews 
though. I went right to Harvard 
from High school for 2 years 
<Jay> Bruderhof: what wp groups do you 
belong to now? 
<Bruderhof> Jay: no comment there, 
none 
<Skinhead> are you proud of your 
european heritage? 
<Jay> Skinhead: why do you assume my 
heritage is European? 
<Skinhead> natural assumption i guess. 
can't see non-Whites getting into 
yale without affirmative action. 
and I would imagine they are still 
a minority there 
<JOY> I don't know ... there are a 
lot of non-Whites at Yale. 
Something like 35%. 
<Skinhead> damn 
<Bruderhof> Nigger at yale=aa! 
<Bruderhof> niggers can get in med 
school wi.th C's 
<Jay> Yale does have affirmative 
action admissions. 
<Skinhead> but Whites can't? 
<Bruderhof> Lots of gooks at Yale 
<Skinhead> educating the enemy ... real 
smart 
<Lyncher> Ed-U-Kated Nigger 
<Skinhead> so they can only use it to 
advance "their communities". at the 
expense of ours. when will it end? 
T
he next day, I went on the chat 
group again. The discussion topic 
was "If A Nigger Hangs From A 
Tree And Nobody's There To Hear It 
Does It Make A Sound?" Many of the 
same people were there, including 
Skinhead. 
<Jay> So Skinhead, do, you think the 
white race is in danger? 
<Skinhead> yes don't you? 
<Delia> The white is never in danger. 
They just get complacent at times. 
We are still the pure breed. 
<Jay> Well, there is more 
intermarriage going on now than 
ever before. 
<Skinhead> this is not true Delia: we 
are facing extinction 
<Delia> The race traitors must witer. 
<Delia> wither 
<Delia> Sorry Skin. 
<JOY> Do you think the threat of 
extinction comes from the 
government or from other races? 
<Skinhead> government mostly 
<JOY> So you mean like government 
programs to aid minorities? 
<Skinhead> the u.s. government is our 
biggest enemy 
<Delio> They shroud the Block and the 
mongrels in protection. 
<Skinhead> not only that Jay, but to 
militarily deny White nations, 
White schools, White neighboroods, 
THE NEw JouRNAL 

--- Page 29 ---

etc. 
<Jay> You mean prevent us from arming 
ourselves? 
<Skinhead> no 
<Delio> The whitemon needs more guns. 
<Skinhead> how about militarily AND 
econimicolly? ie S. Africa 
<Jay> So the government should be 
giving more money to white 
countries and less to third world 
countries? 
<Skinhead> well I say no foreign aid 
at all, period 
<Delio> We give billions to the Jew. 
Israel. 
<Jay> Do you think interrqciol 
marriage is a threat too? 
<Delio> Interracial marriage is a 
detriment, however it may also 
purge our kind of bod genetics. 
<Skinhead> in a way, but even though a 
minority mix, their friends, and 
associates usually toke the side of 
the minority and thus eventual 
racial suicide 
<Jay> How do you think we should go 
about fighting? 
<Skinhead> any means necessary 
<Jay> would you ever consider using 
violence? 
<Skinhead> yes. I feel violence is 
being commited on my race doily, 
it's self defence 
<Joy> You mean like drive-by 
shootings, and so on? 
<Delia> The block kills its own. 
<Skinhead> no, like block on white 
crime, and forced integration 
<Delio> Remember Whitey! The Block and 
the Jew ore using you! (Not 
neccessarily in that order!) 
<Jay> Do you think if we segregate, 
things would be better, or do you 
wont to eliminate other races 
fEBRUARY 14, I997 
entirely? 
<Skinhead> and all the while, the 
endless vilification of the White 
race Jay. segregation won't work, 
we must SEPARATE by continents 
<Jay> So N. America would be for 
whites, and African-Americans would 
go bock to Africa? 
<Skinhead> africa for black, asia for 
yellow, s. america for brown europe 
for White, America. I would like 
America for White but it almost 
seems unreal at this point. 
<Jay> Because it's already so diverse? 
<Delio> I blame the Jew for 
influencing our entertainment 
industry. 
<Jay> Do you think that will ever 
happen? Separation by continents? 
<Skinhead> that's the way it started, 
why not? I mean, not many whites in 
asia or africa, but lots of them in 
our countries 
<Delia> The block insists on not using 
birth control. Its like rats 
breeding. 
<Jay> Well, for one thing, the 
worldwide racial diversity we're 
seeing now is the result of 
centuries of immigration. 
<Skinhead> I can't believe that we ore 
around 10% of the world's 
population and we let them in our 
countries! that's suicide! 
<Joy> Hove you ever read any Hitler? 
<Skinhead> Meim Kampf was a lightouse 
in a storm to me. 
I
was looking at the scene of an 
execution. In front of me were four 
men. Three were soldiers, jackbooted 
storm troopers with iron helmets. The 
regalia on their shoulders marked them as 
Third Reich Nazis, soldiers in Hitler's 
army. The brims of their helmets cast 
stark shadows in the bright sunlight, 
obscuring their faces. The fourth man was 
an elderly civilian with white whiskers and 
clad in plain clothes. The soldier on the 
left was smirking smugly and had a pistol 
pressed hard into the old man's throat. 
The old man was in pain. He might have 
been sobbing. Perhaps he was begging for 
his life. His muscles were tense. His whole 
body cringed. He was waiting to die. At 
the next moment, the Nazi officer was 
going to shoot him. 
Click. I scrolled down. The graphic of 
the Nazi soldiers carried a caption in 
white block letters: "coo SENT us." Below 
was the German phrase "Juden und 
Schwarze raus"-Jews and blacks get out. 
Further down was a statement: "It is 
simply fact that the White race faces 
certain extinction in the near future." 
This site was called Northern Thunder, a 
neo-Nazi page I found while looking for 
the International White Racialists page, 
the site Skinhead maintained. Something 
about the way he had talked made him 
sound more serious than the others. 
Skinhead's 
page 
was 
another 
technological marvel-text and graphics 
on a grey background decorated with 
engravings of Nazi flags and rows of 
soldiers, all embossed on grey to look as if 
they had been carved in a stone memorial. 
I felt like I had walked into a World War 
II museum in an altered world where the 
Nazis had won the war. An animation box 
flashed the words "WHITE REVOLUTION IS 
THE ONLY SOLUTION." I scrolled down tO a 
list of "POWs," men in prison for violent 
hate crimes. "Bruce Pierce-252 years, 
David Lane-190 years." I read on. Bruce 
Pierce and David Lane, I would later 
learn, were the two white supremacist

defendants convicted in the 1984 
Denver shooting death of Jewish radio 
host Alan Berg. The same David Lane 
who coined the 14 words. 
After more wanderings, I came across 
a Time magazine on-line feature called 
"Free Speech on the Internet," based on 
a TV segment from che NewsHour with 
Jim Lehrer. I clicked to download the 
ten-minute clip. A few seconds later, the 
crisp sound of a TV announcer's voice 
was streaming out of my computer. It 
alternated with the deeper tones of 
interview clips. "Daren Brittell is a self-
described racist. Which means I love my 
race and I'm willing to do whatever it 
takes to secure the Existence of my race. He 
has swastikas on his wall, Hider's Mein 
Kampf on his bookshelf, a shotgun by his 
30 
beef, and a message on his mind. My 
main message is to wake white people up to 
the genocide that is being taken place 
against our race right now. Through his 
computer, he also has a connection to 
the Internet. It's helping me get my 
message across, which is what I am on a 
mission to do. It's to spread the word of 
white survival as far as possible." 
The rhetoric in the news clip 
sounded uncomfortably familiar. The 
phrases Brittell used reminded me of my 
talk with Skinhead. Puzzled, I opened 
the transcript I had kept of the previous 
night's IRC chat. At times, people 
addressed Skinhead as "Daren." I 
noticed Skinhead's network address was 
~db@207.104.138.182. So Skinhead was 
Daren Brittell, an outspoken neo-Nazi, 
willing to publicly advocate violence, 
and an admirer of convicted murderer 
David Lane. I went back to the 
newsgroup, wondering whether I was in 
any danger. I resolved that it would be 
my last time. 
<Riley14> Jay do you know the 14 words 
<Skinhead> 14 words: we must secure 
the existence of our people and a 
future for White children. 
<Jay> Yes. I've been surfing the web. 
<Eric> the beloved 14 words 
<Eric> R U national socialist, Jay? 
<Jay> No, I'm not. Are you, Eric? 
<Eric> yes, i believe in the wisdom of 
the great leader 
<Jay> Eric: By great leader, do you 
mean Hitler?
