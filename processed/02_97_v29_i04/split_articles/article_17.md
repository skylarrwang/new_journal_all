classrooms. Undergraduates are conducting surveillance on how the 
talk-show half lives, spying on the members of the working class, 
peoples of color, closeted gays, and other marginalized compatriots 
of the television nation. 

I went to Ricki because, one, I knew Ricki was a step above Gordon 
Elliot. Two--now this wiLl sound paternalistic-! foe/ it can never hurt 
to have a sane, level-headed individual in the audience. 
-Maria, an anonymous undergraduate 

Lynn Kessler, who organized Saybrook College's October 25, 
1996, trip to the Ricki Lake Show, lied to her contacts at the 
show. When they asked if the group of Saybrugians were 
"ethnically diverse," she passed us off as such. 

Curious to see what it would be like to accompany a large group 
to a talk show, after my experience with only two friends last year, I 
found myself standing on Elm Street. I was waiting for the bus that 
would take me back to Ease 37th Streer-and Ricki. On the bus, we 
theorized about what the day's topic would be; Ricki keeps ir top 
secret until cameras are rolling and taping has begun. Bur Ricki is 
known for her tongue-twisting, tabloid-like titles, so we knew our 
FEBRUARY 14, 1997 
efforts co our-think her were in vain. 

Maria, an undergraduate who wished to have her name changed 
for this article, only hoped the episode wouldn't be a tearjerker. On iJi= 
her first talk-show trip with Saybrook College in the spring of 1996, ~ 
she went to the Gordon Elliot Show. The sexy title, "MY LITTLE. i 
PRINCESS IS NO ANGEL," did not prepare her for the seriousness of the ~ 
topic at hand. Gordon's attitude towards his diabolic princesses ~ 
horrified her, along with many of the other Saybrugians present. -;}. 
Gordon accused a teenage girl of being responsible for her own rape i 
because of the way she dressed. 

Looking back, Maria was disgusted by Gordon's paternalistic § 
reprimand of an adolescent rape victim: "I really realized that half~ 
the time the people on the show are being exploited. When it's § 
children being exploited, it's unbearable to watch." Maria explained, ~ -
"Children don't have the ability to stand up for themselves. When 2_ 
there is a room full of adultS screaming at them that their rape was ~ 
their fault, what are they going to think? It's nor a healthy siruation." ~ 
She further commented, "I thought about going on a crusade to go ~ 
to as many talk shows as possible, to give some some sort of support i 
to the guests." Like a nineteenth-century Protestant reformer, a~ 
woman fighting against child labor in factories and advocating ~
legislated temperance, Maria wished to 
teach the audience a lesson about 
compassion. 

But it wasn't Maria's reformist zeal that 
led her to step aboard the bus. carrying the 
Saybrugians to the Ricki Lake Show last 
October. Instead, it was that ~icki was 
Maria's kindred spirit, striving towards a 
common goal. She felt a bond of sisterhood 
with Ricki, for the host had the good 
manners to empathize with her guests. After 
all, Ricki is a talk-show success story herself 
She went from everyone's favorite fat girl in 
Hairspray and on China Beach, to the 
slimmer, trimmer Queen of Talk Shows, to 
displaying herself as the expectant mother of 
daytime television this past fall. For Maria, 
this talk show host is not guilty of Gordon's 
sexist condescension, but of a gender 
paternalism. Forcefully, Maria suggested to 
me, "Why don't we call it maternalism?" 

Maria's suggestion foreshadowed what 
Saybrook witnessed when we arrived at 
Ricki's .studio in New York City. After we 
satisfied Ricki's demand for docility at her 
various checkpoints- by now I was feeling 
like an old hand at this-we waited 
patiently until we were called to line up for 
seating. At the door leading to the sound 
stage, each guest was handed a trinket, a key 
chain bearing Ricki's name, to remind us of 
our trip to the Ricki Lake Show. I still carry 
mine with me, as do any number of other 
Saybrugians. 

Once inside the sound stage, we were 
entertained by a comedian, who kept us 
pacified and amused until the episode's 
topic was announced and Ricki showed 
herself. I felt a little bit like I was at a child's 
birthday party, waiting for a mother to 
arrive with a cake covered by flickering 
candles. Soon, the long-awaited topic was 
revealed, a kind of "best of the Ricki Lake 
Show': "WE FOUGHT ON RICKJ BEFORE ... BUT 
NOW WE'RE BACK TO SETTLE THE SCORE!" 
The audience loved what the title promised. 
When Ricki stepped onto the sound stage, 
we became frenzied. As I clapped 
passionately in the name of Ricki's arrival, I 
thought that Maria must be pleased by the 
topic. It suggested controlled chaos, not 
Gordon's judgmental aggression. 

During the opening moments of the 
episode, Ricki read a letter. It was from a 
woman who had ap.peared on an earlier 
Ricki Lake Show to resolve her differences 
with her negligent mother. Her mother, 
refusing to communicate with her even afrer 
the show, left her daughter orphaned in the 
wide, wide world. Saddened by the plight of 
this wayward girl, Ricki informed the 
audience that though her biological mother 
had failed her, Ricki had not. Like a 
surrogate mother, Ricki kept in touch with 
the girl-fulfllling Maria's reformist vision 
of talk-show maternalism. 

I find them amusing. Sometimes they bring on 
freaks-weLl, not freaks. People that will 
amuse you, for shock value. 
-Lynn Kessler 

''F reaks, Lynn! They're freaks! " 
Martha Surridge (SY '98) 
exclaimed, pointing at the "self-
proclaimed .freaks" strutting through the 
studio audience, handing out carnations to 
audience members, making their way onto 
the stage for the final segment of the 
October 25, 1996, Ricki Lake Show. All four 
of the freaks-couples Eric and Judy, Nile 

and Bridget-had appeared on an earlier 
episode of the talk show, entitled, "yo BRO! 
YOU THINK I LOOK LIKE A CIRCUS FREAK, 
BUT YOU ' RE A MAJOR GEEK!" The two 
couples were back to update Ricki about 
their lives, which seemed to have little to do 
with the topic at hand. Instead, they were 
there to display their outrageous 
appearances, a spectacle of self-fashioned 
freakiness to be paraded before a gawking, 
gleeful audience. ·· 

Bridget, who lives with Nile in the 
house of her major geek of a brother, looked 
like a trendy, urban mermaid. Shimmering 
like a piece of light blue tinfoil, Bridget's 
dress matched her blue-green hair and 
eyebrows; her aquamarine lipstick was laid 
on thick and magnificent. She wore a pair 
of sleek and shiny, knee-high patent leather 
boots; they resonated with the black spots 
on the leopard collar of her pale blue dress. 
Nile, her companion, had dyed his hair a 
flaming orange, shaping his coiffure into 
spikes the shape of ice cream cones. 
Wearing a leopard-print jacket reminiscent 
of Bridget's collar, Nile was dressed all in 
black, in sharp contrast to his deathly pale 
skin, which looked like it had been 
powdered with the layers of white cosmetics 
used by nobility in seventeenth-century 
French courts. 

Eric and Judy were similarly outlandish. 
Eric's hair glowed ferocious magenta and 
Auoresent green, his clothes screamed plaid, 
and piercings covered his face. There was a 
metal spike through his nose, and his 
earlobes had been stretched around large 
wooden earrings. His girlfriend, Judy, wore 
platform sneakers and a floor-length dress 
covered with blue sequins. During his 
earlier appearance on the Ricki Lake Show, 
Eric talked about the problems his father 
had with his failure to conform. After that, 
Eric explained, "My Dad realized I wasn't 
joking about how I looked." This brief tale 
of filial reunion was all we heard before 
Ricki wrapped up the show, telling her four 
"self-proclaimed freaks" how they had 
served their purpose: "You've cheered up my 
day." 

Ricki wasn't the only one amused by her 
guests. The Saybrugians found the talk 
show just as entertaining. Ricki and her 
show also filled a void. Lynn reflected, 
"Coming from Yale, you're like-you're 
different from the talk show audience. lc's 
kind of fun being in the talk show 
environment because it's so different. It's a 
lot more emotional." She continued, "On 
talk shows, people don't have discussions, 
they scream at each other. It's frenzied." 

Lynn saw the Ricki Lake Show as an 
opportunity for Yale undergraduates, 
otherwise controlled and contained, to go a 
Little bit crazy, to be children under Ricki's 
watchful eyes. 

Presiding over this cultural space, Ricki 
draws in not only "freaks" but also those 
who want to view them. For Lynn, viewing 
is about learning emotion; for Maria, it's 
about teaching compassion. They both 
went to the talk show expecting to 
experience a real-world classroom. But they 
failed to recognize themselves as the 
outsiders-becoming the freaks themselves. 
In the talk show's idiom of freakiness, it is 
Lynn, Maria, and myself who finally don't 
belong.
