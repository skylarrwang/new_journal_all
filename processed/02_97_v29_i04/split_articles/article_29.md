On file: copulating cartoon characters,

t will probably be February 14. The pastel candies 
will be ceasing you mercilessly. "BE MINE," 
they'll beg sarcastically. "''M YOURS," they'll lie. 
You'll bitterly mash the tiny hearts in your mouth, 
ironically underscoring their message. 
You'll be tasting broken heart. 
You'll swallow these candies, considering various 
Yale methods of beating the Valentine blues, only 
slightly aware of the self-destruction implicit in the 
act. 
And then it will come to you, a call from 
another world. Like Costner in a cornfield, you will 
hear the call. 
"Zeta ... " 
It may be a while before you follow the voice, but eventually you 
will. Your blues will disappear iri.to the grey New Haven air. The 
healing power of Zeta lies on the shelves of Yale's library system; and 
you don't have to read well to enjoy it. 
You'll find your way to Seeley Mudd Library, home of Yale's Zeta 
Collection of non-circulating material. When you enter an Orbis 
keyword search for "Zeta and Mudd," you'll retrieve 2,289 entries. 
T he entries will at first seem arbitrary, ranging from Bocaccio's 
Decameron to a book of The New l'Orker cartoons, but before long 
you will sort through such chaff to get to the wheat. And wheat you 
will find ... 
You'll secure an informative copy of The X-Rated Videotape Guide 
IV by Robert Rimmer and Patrick Riley. You'll assume the first 
author to be working under a pseudonym, the second ro be 
moonlighting as coach of the Miami Heat. Call number: ZETA PN 
1995.9 S45 R563X. 
You'll brush up your Spanish by reading Solo Para Adultos: 
Historia del Cine X, an informative tome by Casto Escopico replete 
with "plot" synopses of your favorite porno flicks, as well as 
memorable stills from hits like Deep Throat and Behind the Green 
Door. On page 262 you will find a photograph of John Holmes' 
legendary 15-inch penis. Call number: ZETA PN1995.9 S45 E73. 
You'll recoil in fascinated terror as you glance at juliette De Sade, 
a French cartoon book that features hand-drawn portrayals of 
apocalyptically violent sex. Call number: ZETA PQ 2663 A889 + J9. 
Quickly, you will move on to a different book of French erotic 
pop art, Les Chefi-D'Oeuvre de Ia Bantle Dessinle Erotique, the fifth 
volume of which contains Spiderman with female genitalia, Goofy 
getting laid, "Little Orgasm Annie," and Mickey Mouse doing 
something truly unmentionable to a rather young-
looking pink elephant. Call number: ZETA PN 
6714 + C46. 
Soon, you will regret the fact that these works 
are non-circulating. You'll ask librarians about the 
Zeta Collection, and their answers will strike you as 
disturbingly vague. "It has a quirky character," one 
tell you, and that the collection's purpose is "to 
control material likely to be stolen or damaged." 
hough not entirely satisfied, you'll reluctantly 
acknowledge chat you'd be more inclined to steal 
Exquisite Creatures than Paradise Lost. 
In the 1930s and 1940s, the Zeta Collection 
contained birch control literature that the state of Connecticut 
prohibited from being openly displayed. Back then, the collection 
was housed in a two-story locked cage on the seventh floor of 
Sterling Memorial Library. T he librarian says he "knows the Zeta 
Collection very personally," which you will interpret as some kind of 
joke. Strangely, none of the employees of the Yale Library System 
will be able to tell you when or by whom the Zeta Collection was 
started, or how it got its ominous name. 
Your appetite for smut whetted, you will explore other 
collections of Yale pornography, only to find them pale in 
comparison to the mystical Zeta. You won't deign to investigate 
Sterling's collection of Playbqy magazines, as they're chiefly stored on 
microform, the ultimate anti-erotic medium. You'll consider 
researching Beinecke's collection of Playboys until you notice the 
Orbis caveat "many issues mutilated and/or stained." You will look at 
Mother Yale looming majestically over the circulation desk, and you 
will wonder what she looks like nude. 
So you'll follow the voice back to Mudd and the welcoming 
embrace of Zeta. Soon, the librarians won't need to ask which books 
you're requesting. Soon, you'll hear the images on the pages cooing 
"BE MINE," "KISS ME," and other things not found on Valentine 
candy. You'll have overcome your loneliness, become a Romantic 
scholar; with a straight face, you'll tell your parents that your love life 
is great and you've been spending a lot of time in the library. The 
months will float by like a breeze. · 
And some bleak day, probably in a future February, you'll see a 
downtrodden student walking up Science Hill, angrily chomping on 
some kind of candy. And you'll know what to do: drift up behind 
him, lips by his ear, and pass on the voice: 
"Zeta ... " you'll whisper. The call number of the wild.
