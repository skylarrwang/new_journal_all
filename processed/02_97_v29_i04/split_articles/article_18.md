In the Elm City's cinematic heyday, New Haven and Hollywood 
converged on downtown's bygone movie houses. 
When _the City Was 
a Silver Screen

of the Hotel Duncan. Dorothea Moore stands behind 
the bar at the Anchor Bar and Restaurant. They . begi~ 
their parallel tales with, "Once upon a time there were 
six great picture palaces in New H aven. And they were 
splendid ... " 

With that auspicious opening these long-time New Haven 
citizens and film-lovers recount everything they know about 
cinema and this city. They talk for hours, sometimes pulling out 
• photographs or backtracking to correct a date, to tell you that it 
was Katherine Hepburn and not Bette Davis who starred in 
1942's Women of the Year. 

Dorothea and Big A1 didn't just go catch a flick at the Bijou 
Dream Theater. They ingested movies. They lived through them, 
and through them they built their identities. Here is Big Al, not 
as a hotel desk clerk, but as a debonair Johnny from the Rita 
Hayworth noir classic, Gilda. Here, too, is Dorothea, not as a 
cocktail waitress, but as Gilda herself-sudden, vicious, and 
tragic. 

D 
orothea runs the Anchor, where suburbanites and Yalies 
stop for a drink after a show at the Shubert, itself a one-
rime movie theater. Throughout her day, she cites 
dialogue from All About Eve as if it were a sacred text 

When All About Eve opened at the Paramount on Temple 
Street in 1950, Dorothea convinced her boyfriend, "a blonde-
haired fellow, not too good-looking, but nice," to take her to the 
very first screening. He picked her up at her parents' home off

Prospect Street and escorted her to the nearest trolley station. 
· True to the fashion of the time, Dorothea wore white gloves and 
a hat. Her boyfriend took her arm and walked between her and 
the street, protecting her from traffic and other urban menaces. 

As patrons filed into the theater, a large organ and an aspiring 
young pianist were lifted up on a platform in front of the screen. 
Dorothea admits that this was often her favorite part of the 
evening. She relished the glamour of having a uniformed usher 
escort her to a seat, and then listening to the organ spin out 
classical and popular music while watching everyone else take 
their seats. 

All About Eve had a special importance to its New Haven 
viewers. A portion of the film was staged and shot in the Elm 
City. Over a static shot of the corner of Chapel and College 
streets, the narrator, an uppity English theater critic, remarks, 
"New Haven. Con-nec-ti-cut. To the theater world a small strip ., 
of sidewalk between the Shubert Theater and the Taft Hotel." g 
Like most residents of New Haven, Dorothea delighted in this ~ 
reference to her hometown, regardless of its derisive tone. ~ 
"Usually, we were very polite at the theater. Everyone back then ~ 
was nicer and had a sense of decency, but when New Haven ~ 
came up, everyone let out a cheer." 

~ 
When the show concluded, Dorothea and her date walked ~ 
over to Liggett's Drug Store on the corner of Church and Chapel ~ 
streets. T hey had sodas, chatted with friends, and listened to ~ 
some hit records. Then the blonde-haired, not too good-looking ~ 
young man escorted Dorothea home and kissed her once before ~

Years later, when workmen were 
converting the Taft Hotel into an 
apartment building, they mentioned to 
Dorothea that they were gutting the 
famous room where scenes from All About 
Eve were filmed. To the bewilderment of 
her husband and co-workers, Dorothea 
rushed out of the Anchor, crossed the 
tightly cordoned construction lines, and 
climbed in high heels to the top of a 
dumpster where she begged the foreman 
to give her the mantle piece from Eve 
· Harrington's room. He knew exactly what 
she was talking about and wrapped a 
piece of it in his jacket for her to take 
home. "I chink it's somewhere in my 
garage," she says now. 

Dorothea breaks off her story to hand 
two customers their checks. She turns 
back around to give this final invective, 
"Then that Mayor Richard Lee came 
along with all those modern ideas we call 
improvements ... But things were more 
elegant then. Simpler. Quieter. Before all 
the noise." Dorothea tells of trying to 
find the corner where the old l.'aramount 
stood, but none of the office buildings 
now there mesh with her idealized. past. 
"They all look alike, you know." 

A
mong newspapers clippings and 
yellowing photographs, Big AI 
points to a picture of a quintet of 
serious looking businessmen. The only 
one smiling is a short and slightly oily-
looking man with a handlebar mustache 
standing in the center. Meet one of the 
forgotten founding fathers of American 
cinema, New Haven's own S. Z. Poli. 

Although he's been dead for over half a 
century, Mr. Poli is always addressed in 
the formal. 

Poli purchased the American Theater 
(formerly St. Mary's Church) in 1893 and 
converted it into one of the largest 
theaters in New England. An intuitive 
and brash entrepreneur, Poli may have 
been the first American to show a film for 
entertainment purposes. In early 1896, 
between acts of Vaudeville theater, Poli 
experimented with French cinematograph 
reels. By the summer of 1897, at Poli's 
Bijou Dream Theater, New Haven 
residents paid less than a nickel to watch 
the debut of Gr~at American Biograph: 
18 
The Ride Through Haverstraw TunneL. 

Advertisements from a turn-of-the-
century New Haven Evening Register tout 
the theater's "fairyland waterfall encased 
in a crystal staircase and luxurious marble 
foyer." An enormous success, profits from 
the Bijou Dream Theater, "the house of 
cinema hits," allowed Poli to acquire a 
space across the street which he named 
after himself, the Poli Theater. 

Already a millionaire, Poli purchased 
one theater after another, some as far 
away as Washington, D.C. and Worcester, 
Massachusetts. When Poli retired in 
1928, he had assembled a chain of 28 
theaters which stretched across the 
Eastern Seaboard and were rivaled in 
opulence only by New York's and Los 
Angeles's picture palaces. In that same 
year, he remodeled the Hyperion Theater 
on Chapel Street, renaming it the College 
Theater. Of Poli's three New Haven 
theaters, only the College stands today, a 
gutted and vacant shell. 

He eventually sold most of his 
theaters to the Fox Corporation and the 
Loews Corporation for a reported $30 
million. With those funds, he built a 
series of mansions in Milford for himself 
and his daughters: Then Mr. Poli, a man 
whose theaters were artfully integrated 
with lower level cafes and shops, a man 
who 
intimately 
understood 
the 
importance of crowds and pedestrian 
traffic, accomplished the most prophetic 
feat of his life-he built a private movie 
theater for his family. 

F 
rom a leather-bound scrapbook Big 
AI produces a photograph of the 
exterior of Loew's Poli Theater. An 
over-sized 
light-bulb 
letterboard 
dominates the scene. "Disney's Fantasia," 
it shines. As if the lights weren't enough 
to draw a passerby's attention, two men 
dressed in fedoras and trench coats point 
up to rhe sign. When Fantasia opened in 
1942, Big AI was just a child. It was one 
of his first experiences at the movies. He's 
been a dedicated connoisseur ever since. 

Big AI does not follow worldly events 
or speak foreign languages. He's content 
to occupy the world along the few blocks 
from his house to his work. He's happiest 
when he's squirreling through his 
scrapbooks, crying to locate a certain 
photograph and getting lost in a 
forgotten newspaper clipping along the 
way. A natural but untrained historian, 
Big AI's instinct told him to start saving 
these scraps of paper: advertisements, 
ticket stubs, flyers, posters, photographs, 
and newspaper clippings, anything which 
might preserve his experiences at the 
movies. "I just couldn't throw these things 
away. " 

He points to a photograph. "Do you 
wane me to show you the old Paramount 
cheater? Nobody appreciates these things 
anymore," Big AI says. 

By the mid-1970s the Roger Sherman 
RKO and the College Theater were the 
last of New Haven's downtown picture 
palaces. Both of them began to cater to 
audiences that were younger, mostly 
black, and usually male. Blaxploitation 
films, reggae documentaries, violent 
science fiction works, and pornography-
these movies were common fare for the 
College in particular. Big AI remembers 
when the College played its last film, Evil 
Knievel, in 1977. Big AI could not bear to 
attend. 

Big AI picks up a newspaper clipping, 
an article about the 'College Theater's 
demise. He shakes his head. And then 
with sudden vigor, he clutches one of his 
scrapbooks and says, "What's a guy to do? 
What's a guy to do these days with all of 
this?" Surrounded by sheaves of yellowing 
paper, he's unable to maintain a single 
thread of conversation. As he uncovers an 
interesting photograph, he jumps from 
past to present and chen retreats 
backwards in time. 

I 
t was a week before the Christmas of 
1952: a young Big AI walked into his 'll 
favorite theater, the Poli, right across g 
the street from the Bijou. Despite their~ 
proximity, the Poli and the Bijou did not~ 
compete for audiences. If the Bijou was ~ 
an elegant beauty, then the Poli was a ~ 
handsome bachelor. It tended to show~ 
serious dramas, continuing to play~ 
newsreels even after television had made ~ 
rhem obsolete. Big AI was there to see ~ 
Gr~at Whitt Hunter starring Gregory Peck ~ 
as Ernest Hemingway. He came alone for ~ 
the afternoon matinee because none of!.
