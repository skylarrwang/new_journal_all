With that, the movement on my 
screen abruptly stopped. I had been 
kicked off the chat group and banned 
from returning. I suddenly became 
aware that it was midnight and I was 
sitting alone in a dark computer lab. 
T
hree nights of chatting with real-
life neo-Nazis left me feeling 
sick. But surfing the web the next 
day, I understood why hate groups of all 
kinds have seized on the Internet as a 
primary method of advertising. 
Skinheads, white supremacists, neo-
Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, and those who 
deny the Holocaust all find a home on 
the Internet. Some pages, like the 
Nigger Joke Center, are merely sickening 
and offensive. Ochers are more serious, 
intended to persuade and recruit. It is 
impossible to know whether Eric would 
follow through on his violent threats, 
but we know that at least some of the 
denizens of these groups are for real. 
The White Aryan Resistance Hate Page, 
for instance, is maintained by Tom 
Metzger, a former Klansman who quit 
the KKK to found his own more extreme 
group, the White Aryan Resistance. 
Metzger was later found guilty of 
inciting murder, after three members of 
his group beat an Ethiopian student to 
death in Portland, Oregon. 
Many of the pages are infected with 
a bizarre paranoia about the impending 
"extinction" of white people. The Aryan 
Nation's page warns that at only 8 
percent of the world's population, the 
white "race," is in danger of genocide at 
the hands of "the Jew" -a curious 
reversal. 
Other 
pages 
explicitly 
denounce this culture of fear. Some try 
to conceal their racism, proclaiming chat 
they do not hate at all, but merely love 
their race and are willing to fight for it. 
The Adelaide Institute, for instance, 
runs a page that denies the Holocaust. 
"Why would 
anyone 
find 
this 
offensive?" the page demands. "We are 
celebrating the living who were thought 
dead." Another recurring theme is the 
metaphor of a great war, and a certain 
nostalgia for the days of the Third 
Reich. One page is named "Blur und 
Ehr," meaning "Blood and Honor"-che 
motto of the Nazi SS. 
Hate groups on the net have 
proliferated to the point where it is now 
possible to stumble across these sites 
without even looking for them. A search 
for the word "holocaust" on the search 
engine at Lycos yields a link to 
alt.revisionism-a discussion group 
devoted to denying the Holocaust. 
There 
is 
nothing 
to 
prevent 
schoolchildren from unwittingly coming 
across these sites. 


Many users agree that to fight 
Internet hate, we must meet it on its 
own terms, using its same technology to 
combat it by exposing its lies and 
rhetoric for what they are. It is in this 
spirit that a librarian at the Harvard Law 
Library created a site called Hatewatch 
(http : //www.hatewatch.org). 
Hatewatch's mission is to monitor hate 
groups, keeping live links to their Web 
pages. We can no more wipe out hate on 
the Internet than we can wipe out the 
human impulse to hate. But, with 
vigilance, we can show the users of the 
Internet why these hate groups are 
wrong.
