You wander into Store 24 searching for something to help you face the coming dawn. Their coffee is lukewarm at best, and pill-popping has never been your thing. You plod along, bleary-eyed, to the beverage cases, anticipating the syrupy comfort of a Coke. Then you spy the bottle. You're drawn towards its busy green and red label boasting "maximum caffeine" in yellow letters. 

Welcome to the Interstellar Beverage Company's fantasy of your initial encounter with Krank20, the world's first caffeinated water. 

Marketed as "the world's coolest caffeine delivery system," Krank20 offers more than a snazzy label to attract exhausted Gen-Xers. Promotional items abound, including stickers, posters, T-shirts, and the coveted "kranksta" rubber band gun. For the truly devoted, there is even a web site, complete with mascot Grinny and the "Krankee of the Week." 

Publicity continues through radio spots and fliers that declare, "Inside: Krank20 is manufactured using a proprietary process called '332ZIR,' which assures superior consistency, highest caffeine levels and great taste! Outside: Exciting graphics on the bottle and support materials set Krank20 apart from the crowd!" 

According to its distributors, Krank20 has met with sweeping success. Sold in 30 states, it can be found nearly everywhere, from military bases to universities. The Interstellar Beverage 3 Company receives ten to 15 calls per night praising the product, and its website boasts 8 10,000 hits a week. The company confidently claims that "after nearly two years in development, Krank20 Highly Caffeinated Water has emerged as the most exciting and intriguing functional food in today's beverage market." 

Included in its marketing literature is the following success story: "Yale University coffee shop sells three cases during the first night after delivery of a six-case order." 

An employee at Durfee's Sweet Shop confirms this story, saying, "Yes, it's true. But it was probably because our cooler was barely stocked with anything else. It was hot back in September, but now it's died off." The Durfee's cooler attests to this, as rows of Krank20 sit idly waiting while bottles of Snapple, Tropicana, and Poland Spring water are replaced almost hourly. 

Apparently, this is not unique to Durfee's. When presented with a bottle ofKrank20, the clerk at Krauszer's replied, "We don't sell much of that at all. See for yourself." He gestured toward a full cooler ofK.rank20 that remained virtually untouched the entire week. An employee at Quality Liquors echoed this sentiment, saying, "We used to sell it. We don't anymore. We ordered a couple of cases and sold about three bottles." 

Only the Store 24 clerk reported con-tinuous sales of Krank20, and these were mostly to students who were repeat buyers. It appears that these purchasers have reason to be satisfied; the product does taste like water and manages to deliver the effects of 100 milligrams of caffeine per 500 milliliters of water. But, these devotees comprise only the smallest minority ofYale students. 

For the vast majority of people in Krank20's 15- to 24-year-old target group, the product may as well not exist. As evidenced by its stagnant pre$ence on campus, "exciting graphics" and a website are not enough to convince consumersÂ· that caffeinated water is anything more than a passing fad.
