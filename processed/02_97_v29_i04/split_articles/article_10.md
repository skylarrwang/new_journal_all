**Mythic Pizza**

A young man behind the counter at Pepe's Pizzeria sidesteps a pile of coal, adroitly whirling an enormous wooden oar. He flips open a narrow metal flap in the brick wall, pulls out a bubbling, thin crust pizza from the 12-squar'-foot oven, and lands it on an aluminum tray. 

"Specialty pizzas? Oh, we have so many ... " says Sal Montagna. Sal is a 57-year veteran pizza-maker for Pepe's. In a smock as white as his hair, he leans thoughtfully over the wooden counter. "White clam pizza-that's a big seller. Then we have the veggie special, special with anchovies, sausage and mushroom, pepperoni and mushroom ... " 

For most college towns, pizza places are as essential as bookstores, and more numerous. New Haven is no exception. Yale enjoys the rare privilege of being located in the home of the pizza, or at least the home of the nation's best. 

The aroma from Sally's and Pepe's ovens has wafted over the nation's collective nose, attracting a parade of famous fans. The Clintons (both as lowly students and as the lofty First Couple), Presidents Reagan and Kennedy, Danny DeVito, Tony Bennett, Frank Sinatra, and Paula Abdul are among the stars who have stamped a tomato-stained seal of approval on Wooster Square's pies. 

The walls of Sally's restaurant display gifts left by big-name clientele. One can dine on seasonal veggie pizza beside candid black-and-whites of Kennedy and Sinatra or take a gander at the Doonesbury rendition of a Sally's chef. Sally's most recent acquisition is the tennis racket with which Richard Krajikec won Wimbledon last year. "He comes here every night of his stay during the Pilot Pen tournament," says Flora Consiglio, the wife of the late founder of Sally's. 

Krajkec joins an army of devotees who pay regular homage to Wooster Square's pizza parlors-an army willing to weather hours of anticipation and salivation for their tasty reward. At 4 p.m., opening time for Pepe's, the tables are full. By 6 p.m., the line of customers extends out the door. Pepe's keeps its annex, site of the original Pepe's, as a reserve to handle the overflow. 

When Frank Pepe opened his pizzeria in 1925, pizza was still considered ethnic food. Consiglio says Pepe and his nephew Sal, who established Sally's in 1938, were among the first to make pizzas commercially. 

When Modern Pizza set up shop in 1934 and Sally's branched off from its father store, people speculated that the cause was a familial or culinary dispute. But Consiglio, who has never tasted pizza other than Sally's, refutes such rumors. "That's all just hearsay. We're all the best of friends." Evidently, pizza has been the focus of an impassioned urban myth. 

Any way you slice it, Sally's and Pepe's needn't be concerned about losing clientele to competition. Even if most collegiate connoisseurs choose Broadway, Yorkside, Town and Bar pizzas because of proximity, there are plenty of customers to go around. So long as presidents, tennis champs, pop stars and other die-hards-like the ones who fly into New Haven just for a pie-keep coming, Wooster Square will remain pizza's famed culinary home.
