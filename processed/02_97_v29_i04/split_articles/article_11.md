nternational Festival of Arts and Ideas coordinators Anne
Calabresi, Roslyn Meyer (ES '71, MS '73, PhD '77), and
Elinor Biggs are in the business of breaking boundaries.
They battle against the social, economic, and geographic
segmentation that prevents New Haven from capitalizing on its
resources-namely, the city's location on the Eastern Seaboard,
its lively arts community, and its layout around the central New
Haven Green. They believe in breaking boundaries creatively,
using the arts as a means of melding these resources into a city
that will be attractive to residents and visitors alike. "We want
to create an air of vibrancy in New Haven and make it a place
people want to be year-round," Meyer says. The festival's
creators-Calabresi, Meyer, and businesswoman Jean
Handley-believe that to foster this environment, they must
eliminate divisions among New Haven's neighborhoods. They
see the festival as the ideal way to achieve this lofty goal. After
all, believes Calabresi, people are at their best when they are
playing and creating in the ways that the festival encourages
them to do.


At the inaugural festival last June, oversized papier-mache
figures from the Bread and Puppet Theatre towered over
toddlers who stared upwards in awe, actor-activist Ruben Blades
showcased his reputation as a world-class salsa musician, and
Native American singer Buffy Sainte-Marie performed folk
music on the New Haven Green's specially-constructed "World ~
Stage." Other artists set up shop on patches of sidewalk nearby, g
showing off their talents with magic tricks, juggling, or mime. ~
Pictures and videotapes of the festival lend support to the idea ~
of building bridges between New Haven's diverse ~
neighborhoods; each recorded event shows people of all ages ~
and ethnicities, swathed in brightly-colored shorts and T-shirts, ~
swinging their bodies to the music and clapping their hands in ~
excitement.


Despite New Haven's current reputation as a city stricken by ~
poverty, violence, and economic decline, Meyer, Calabresi, and g
festival executive director Biggs remain unruffled. In fact, they ~
are defiant. "New Haven is so underrated and overcriticized, it's ;;)
pathetic," Meyer says. "I came here in 1969, and I never left."


Yet festival organizers are aware that pessimistic media ~
coverage may dissuade potential attendees from New Haven's l>
::l.
suburbs and beyond. Jean Handley, the third festival co- :
founder, woke up sweating the night before its opening, g_
suffering nightmares that no one would appear for the Yale-New g:
Haven tours planned for the kickoff. Before the first tour, g:
however, a large crowd had already amassed. "There were people
waiting in line-moms with strollers!" Handley says excitedly,
her tone betraying her surprise. "On the tour, they saw
wonderful architecture and buildings that we pass blindly every
day. We have gotten so we do not see
what's good about the city, we look at the
things that need improving." Handley
has a more optimistic view of New
Haven's offerings. "I see it as a city with
great potential and, increasingly, others
see it that way, too. The governor already
refers to New Haven as the cultural
capital of the state." Part of the festival's
objective is to capitalize on the idea of
New Haven as a cultural center for the
East Coast. This will be aided by the
planned construction of a high-speed
train
between
New
Haven
and
Manhattan that will only encourage
visitors from the New York metropolitan
area, Calabresi says.


Biggs defends New Haven's ability to
become a renowned arts cent'Cr and
popular tourist destination. She sits in
the festival office, which opens onto a
view of the New Haven Green and Yale's
gothic Old Campus. Biggs waves her arm
in front of the windows, as if to pull back
a curtain and reveal a scene from last
summer's festival. "If I had looked out
this window during the festival, I would
have seen literally .thousands of people
walking around down there," she says.
Her tone is incredulous as she speaks of
parents and children walking hand in
hand on the Green after sunset. "Maybe
there were. only 20,000 people there, but
we changed their attitudes."


T
he road to Calabresi's farmhouse
runs down Whalley Avenue into
the town of Woodbridge, where
the street metamorphoses from a car
dealership mecca inco a wooded country
road. T he farmhouse tops a steep,
winding driveway that lets the driver
forget he or she is only moments from a
road leading direcdy back to New Haven.
Inside the house's blue and white
country kitchen, frantic energy abounds.
This room has probably seen the birth of
many of the ideas behind the festival's
creation. Calabresi plugs in an electric
teapot an d seats herself at the large
wooden table that dominates the floor
space. D ressed in a green suit and white
blouse, with a scarf draped across her
neck like a dishtowel and her blonde hair
in a loose French twist, she looks like a
1990s career woman in the home of an
1890s farmer's wife.


Calabresi, a founder of both L.E.A.P.
(Leadership, Education, Athletics in
Partnership) and the festival, has long
been recognized as a community leader
and advocate. She sees her work on the
festival's board of directors as one more
way of improving the quality of life in
New Haven. "I think of this as an
extension of working with inner-city
kids," she says, "because New Haven is
threadbare in terms of financial
resources."


Certain community members level
criticism at the festival for becoming an
event organized by the white elite for the
white elite, but Calabresi, Meyer, and
Biggs dismiss this claim as ridiculous.
Nevertheless, in raising funds for what
they hope will become an internationaJiy
renowned festival, the organizers'
connections have proven advantageous.
"I knew I could go to Paul Newman to
ask for money for the arts," Calabresi
says. She readily admits that if someone
from Newhallville showed up at
Newman's door, he or she would not
have the same luck.


H
eading in the opposite direction
out of New Haven's center, Elm
Street becomes Grand Avenue
and leads to Centro San Jose. It curls
across railroad cracks and past storefronts
that display equal parts Spanish and
English. Centro San Jose itself, a social
services and youth center that primarily
serves New Haven's Hispanic population,
looks abandoned from the outside. Its
graffiti-covered, red-paneled walls and
the small sign propped in the window do
not distinguish it from the rest of the
block. Inside, a cramped room holds a
desk and two buckets to catch runoff
from the leaky ceiling. Despite the
buckets, a pool has formed on the
desktop and caused the vinyl to buckle.
A larger, rectangular room serves as
the main recreational area. The room has
a linoleum floor and no windows. A
handful of children scamper around,
bouncing between a makeshift stage and
a ping-pong table. They chatter in a
mixture of Spanish and English and lick
