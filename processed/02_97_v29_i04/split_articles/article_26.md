waist. On the benches circling his glade, 
old men sleep and women read; one 
mother rocks a stroller absently. The 
Indians at Foxwoods are massive, 
unidentified, prelinguistic, prehistoric. 
There are no statues of the white 
man; instead there are animatronic 
robots. They emerge from casement 
windows above the storefront facades 
that line the casino's maze of hallways. 
Captain John and the tavern mistress 
Abby show off their plastic musculature 
as they tell anecdotes to passersby. They 
talk about their histories, romances, 
families, morals, jobs. If you listen long 
enough, their tapes repeat. 

Not one of us wins money that 
night. We leave at 7 a.m. Outside it is 
dawn, and the rain has thinned to a cold 
gray nag. Misery. 

Vanessa Gezari (SY '97) grew up 
in 
the 
idyllic 
town 
of 
Stonington, about ten miles from 
Ledyard. It is a quiet place, a small 
fishing 
village 
turned 
Defense 
Department factory outlet, turned 
depressed victim of military budget cuts. 
Its charm did not disappear with the 
U.S. Navy, however, and the affluent 
residents of Stonington Village and the 
city folk who summer there still find it a 
pleasant place. Stonington considers 
itself just a little more sophisticated than 
its rural neighbor Ledyard, where the 
houses are spaced at three-mile intervals, 
and the only site worth seeing is the new 
casino on the Pequot reservation. 

The people of Stonington feel the 
presence of Foxwoods, looming on 
Ledyard's thin, rocky soil. They have 
witnessed demographic change; the lure 
of employment brings families from as 
far as Las Vegas. Its jobs also pull locals 
up from destitution. Foxwoods has 
proved to be a stopper in the economic 
leak that threatens the area. It employs 
the laid-off workers from the closing 
factories, the struggling carpenters, the 
odd-jobs men who can't find work. 

Demographic change breeds tension. 
The introduction of unknown elements 
causes hairs to bristle on the backs of 
local necks. A mounting flurry of small 
crimes has brought discomfort. Last 
summer, Stonington witnessed its first 
murder in eight years. Change comes 
from all directions: the flotsam of the 
casino circuit, the out-of-state and out-
of-town gamblers, an Indian population 
whose affluence and influence rises 
exponentially. 

Vanessa sees the casino as both the 
cause of and the solution to the tension. 
"The kind of frictions that are going to 
develop are the kind that are going to 
develop anywhere when you have a poor 
or lower-middle-class, working, blue-
collar community that is not able to 
raise itself above a certain level, and then 
you have people who are fabulously 
wealthy. On the other hand, Foxwoods 
has a weird way of gelling all of that 
friction because of the thrill of the 
casino. It has to do with winning 
money." 

"The possibility of instant mobility," 
I offer. 

"Even when you lose, you feel like 
you had a chance at least. It seems to 
smooth over the very frictions that 
would occur in this kind of a 
community. I mean there is racism, but 
there is racism everywhere." 

The Indians, she says, are a familiar 
presence. Their names mark the land. It 
is the local reaction to the presence of 
other racial groups, those using 
Foxwoods, 
that emphasizes how 
provincial this part of the state is. The 
Indians, for the time being, are treated 
with a grudging respect. I ask if Indians 
are the butt of wisecracks. 

"Right now there is a sort of awe, 
and almost a kind of 'good ol' boys' 
feeling about them. The area is 
predominantly white, and even the 
people who are white and middle to 
lower class feel like this is the Indians 
making good, and they sort of feel like 
they're just slapping them on the back. 
It's the kind of thing where it's like, 
'Yeah, those guys don't have anything to 
worry about,' which could turn very 
easily into, 'They don't have anything to 
worry about, let's go give them 
something to worry about.'" 

The casino benefits its employees: 
the pay is decent and the working 
conditions are good. The members of 
the Pequot tribe who take a cut of 
Foxwoods' astronomical proceeds are 
getting a taste of the good life. It is the 
gamblers who are losing money by the 
busload. Vanessa tells a story that has 
the ring of everyday truth, a dreary fact 
of life in a casino town. 

"A friend of a friend was waiting in 
line for the movies in Niantic behind 
this couple. Niantic has a good theater, 
it plays artsy movies. The movies are 
$3.50. The man turned to the woman 
and said, 'You know what, I don't think 
we can afford this. I think I lost too 
much 
money at 
Foxwoods this 
weekend.' And the couple just left. 
That's $7.00." 

Such exchanges promise to become 
quotidian. It already sounds almost like 
an eerie admonition, a dull fairy tale 
FEBRUARY 14, 1997 
whose moral is implicit in its brief plot. 
Foxwoods' new rival, the Mohegan Sun, 
opened this October in Uncasville, 
Connecticut, just a stone's throw from 
Ledyard. Foxwoods itself already has an 
expansion project underway, to be 
completed by the end of 1997, that will 
add 900 hotel rooms to the existing 500, 
as well as more gaming space. The 
Mashantucket Pequots also plan to open 
a summer theme park. Seasonal tourists 
and a migrant labor force will glut and 
purge the area annually, injecting money 
and depleting resources. Vanessa thinks 
the theme park will upset the balance 
between the quiet seaside community 
and 
giddy 
entertainment 
megalopolis in its midst. 

"Foxwoods is still this thing that is 
really hidden away in the woods in 
Ledyard. It's very self-sustained right 
now. It's doing a good job-and I don't 
know if it will keep doing a good job-
but it's both employing a really large 
number of people and not doing a lot of 
damage ... it seems. Until we get some 
sort of seepage, which may happen with 
this increase in crime, if it is really 
connected. And what about theft? Not 
the bloody crime, but what about people 
getting their fix? I mean, are we going to 
start having Addicts Anonymous, 
Gamblers Anonymous...?" 

As Vanessa talks, thoughts of 
Foxwoods shift and rearrange in my 
head. Fragments of the overheard and 
the surreptitiously seen collect. I picture 
myself standing by the casino doors, 
watching two very overweight men in 
gold and hightops creating banter for 
the sake of the thin woman who 
accompanies them. She looks on, 
amused, as one man says to the other, 
"You're a junkie, man. You're addicted. 
Take a slot machine and stick it in your 
arm." He jabs his forefinger into his own 
arm like a syringe. The accused shakes 
his head and protests that he didn't 
come at all last week. The first man 
points to a dispenser of flyers advertising 
the gambling addiction hotline. "You 
need that number, man?"
