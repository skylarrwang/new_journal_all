"I 
remember when Yale students actually wore the 
clothes sold in J. Press," says my grandmother when 
we walk through New Haven, her old hometown. 
"Goodness, how times have changed." 

As my grandmother has noticed, J. Press is usually empty. The 
high-priced stores lining Chapel Street are equally devoid of 
customers. I have yet to see one of J. Press's $50 Yale scarves on 
an actual student. And I, for one, am afraid to even touch one of 
Ann Taylor's suits, much less purchase one. 

It seems I am not alone; most of the outfits I see on campus 
are obvious attempts to satisfy the need for casual comfort. The 
only trend that seems to have been a hit with Yale students is the 
grunge look. Women without make-up and men in sweats seem 
to be less the exception than the rule. But I'm hesitant to describe 
what Yalies consider campus chic since ours seems to be a 
singularly Yale style. What makes such a geographically diverse 
group as Yale's student body come to dress in the same form of 
non-style? 

New Haven's frigid winters are one explanation. It's not that 
my Yale friends and I don't care about looking good, it's just that 
we care more about being warm. Wearing an above-the-knee skirt 
in below-freezing temperatures is not comfortable. While both 
my homecoming and prom dresses saw the light of day last year, 
for this year's winter ball I donned a pair of faded blue corduroys 
and my duck boots. If walking up the ice slicks we call sidewalks 
doesn't inspire Yale women to put away their high heels in favor 
of ungainly, but remarkably steady, winter boots, I don't know 
what will. 

But weather alone can't explain why personal grooming seems 
so different here from the rest of the world. People at similarly 
frigid schools have very different experiences with the world of 
college fashion. According to a friend at Boston University, Yalies 
are mere fashion amateurs. In Boston, nothing gets in the way of 
style, which, incidentally, is a concept very different from the 
utilitarian parkas and boots of Yale. Leather jackets are de rigueur 
for men-no down coats there-and women wear body-
conscious styles even in the dead of winter. My friend attributes 
this to the international students who come to Boston, bringing 
European high fashion and the money to back it up. Her 
description was verified by a friend at Columbia, where even the 
grime of a New York winter can't keep the fashion mavens down. 

So if weather isn't affecting our neighbors to the North and 
South, it can't be the only reason Yalies seem to have lost their 
fashion know-how. Our sense of style, it would appear, relates to 
our sense of self. 

The importance (or non-importance) of appearance in the 18 
years that precede matriculation at college makes an imprint. It 
seems the study habits students bring to Yale offer reason for our 
fashion anemia. Eighteen straight hours of studying somehow 
make fashion less of a priority. The sweatpants and matted hair
