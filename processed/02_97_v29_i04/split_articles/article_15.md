event to areas beyond the Green. 
Organizer Bitsie Clark sees Audubon 
Street as ideal for this. Despite what 
some might term high-class architecture 
and storefronts and the area's placement 
on the outskirts of downtown, Clark 
does not perceive Audubon Street as an 
exclusive area of the city. "The viewpoint 
of people is that it's a place where arts 
take place," she says, noting that 
ArtSpace, Educational Center for the 
Arts, Foundry Music, and the Arts 
Council all make their homes on the 
single city block. 

Centro San Jose did make it to 
Audubon Street for the International 
Festival offshoot. The center participated 
in Art on the Edge through its after-
school drumming group. Long rehearsals 
with a professional drummer ensured a 
successful performance, Noble says, 
though he does not feel the group needed 
to prove itself to others. "We were 
looking to make sure that people know 
what's going on in other neighborhoods. 
We're not going to come back to this 
neighborhood and be judged," he says. 
"But people were curious to see what we 
were about, and I guess in that way there 
was some pressure." 

Jennifer Rivas, a 13-year-old sixth 
grader in the drumming group, wears 
baggy jeans and a mustard yellow 
T-shirt and keeps her long brown hair in 
a ponytail. She talks about "touching," a 
colloquialism for drumming. "We 
touched, we danced. It was fun," she says 
smiling a wide-mouthed grin. Before Art 
on the Edge, Jennifer had never been to 
Audubon Street. Now, she shrugs and 
says, "Yeah, it's nice there." 

Eventually, International Festival 
organizers hope to expand Art on 
the Edge to other neighborhoods 
in New Haven. Noble would welcome an 
Art on the Edge festival in his area. 
Attendance at such a festival, however, 
depends on the community's accessibility. 
For Noble, accessibility relies more on 
logistical dilemmas than on overcoming 
racial or socio-economic obstacles. "If 
people feel the arts or other activities are 
important, they will come here. But we 
need to resolve the transportation issue

first," he says in his characteristically 
subdued tone. 

The idea of fringe festivals in New 
Haven's various neighborhoods is not a 
new one, according to Art on the Edge 
organizer Clark. "It has been done in the 
past and it could easily be revived," she 
says, adding chat Art on the Edge would 
benefit from incorporating the echnicity 
of neighborhoods such as Fairhaven and 
Wooster Square into its programs. She 
hesitates to do chis immediately after the 
Festival's birth, however. "We have to be 
careful chat we don't bite off more than 
we can chew at first," Clark says 
pragmatically. Expansion of Art on the 
Edge is not a one-way street. Noble says 
the issue of attracting audiences to 
neighborhoods such as the Hill works in 
reverse as well; the residents of the 
neighborhoods must be attracted to the 
idea of celebrating the arts. The people 
who frequent Centro San Jose, for 
instance, sometimes need convincing that 
such an event benefits themselves and 
their families. "Our approach is to try to 
explain co people chat these activities are 
different, but worthwhile," says Noble. 

For 
now, 
festival 
organizers 
concentrate on 
establishing 
the 
International Festival and Art on the 
Edge as successful annual events in New 
FEBRUARY 14, 1997 
Haven. They also focus on crossing the 
boundaries that prevent everyone in New 
Haven from participating. Calabresi's 
welcoming speech at the festival made 
clear the double goal of spearheading a 
regeneration of New Haven's arts 
tradition and using that tradition to form 
a city-wide community. "Let us welcome 
to our extraordinary city our visitors," 
she urged Festival attendants last June. 
"Let us shake a stranger's hand and say, 
'Thank you and welcome to our future."' 
Her words belonged co the scene: the 
Green , in the midst of summer, with 
toddlers screeching in delight, and snow-
cones dripping onto a patchwork of 
picnic blankets. In mid-February, the 
words sound canned, as though a speech-
writer jotted them down half-an-hour 
before showtime. Walking the streets of 
New Haven, no one remarks on 
boundaries that have been broken or 
bridges that have been crossed since last 
June. Yet the Festival continues its effort 
to form a cohesive New Haven through 
the arts, even as the neighborhoods 
themselves remain on the edge of the 
effort to eliminate boundaries within the 
city's borders.
