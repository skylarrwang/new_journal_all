W
en I walked into the Beach Club, Silliman roo~ 
805, the first thing I noticed was the shot table. 
t was slicked with tequila, reflecting the pale, 
_ lectric-blue light of a neon beer sign. One of the 
hosts of the party, identifiable by his yellow construction hat, 
was filling disposable plastic shot glasses to the brim with 
noxious, cheap liquor. I arrived early and didn't know anyone in 
the room. I hadn't planned to get drunk on a school night, but, 
feeling a little awkward, I went up to one of the two kegs set in 
the middle of the room to pour myself a drink. 
I asked the host about the occasion for his party.

"It's Tequila Monday," he told me. "It's a tradition, but it 
~ hasn't been respected in the past because old Beach Clubs have 
~sucked." The current residents of this suite are determined to 
~ restore the Club to its former glory as a non-exclusive tequila 
! free-for-all, a club whose only membership requirement is the 
~ willingness to get plastered on a Monday night. 
·~ 
This Monday, the first of the semester, there were plenty of 
~ partygoers willing to revive the tradition. As successive waves of 
~ people arrived, the only thing they seemed to have in common 
~was their lack of school work. The stereo in the corner pumped 
~ out an eclectic assortment of dance music. When the Chemical 
if Brothers came on, the composition of the dance floor changed

dramatically. Those who had been dancing to A Tribe Called 
Quest froze awkwardly and got out of the way. 

By 11 p.m., the place was packed. The room, which looked 
enormous when I first arrived, was suddenly claustrophobicaJly 
small. There was a long line at the keg, and a steady rhythm had 
developed at the tequila table: salt-shot-lemon-grimace, salt-shot-
lemon-grimace, salt-shot-lemon-grimace. I tried to navigate the 
crowd, keeping a lookout for a familiar face. I had hoped to find 
someone I knew who could introduce me to the current 
members of the Club. Occasionally I saw someone from a lecture 
or section and exchanged a few words, but no one seemed to 
belong there. I watched people make eye contact, experience a 
brief flicker of recognition, and move on. They seemed more 
engaged with the tequila than with their conversations. 

I bumped into a guy from a seminar whom I knew 
marginally at best. He looked as lost as I did. I leaned forward 
and yelled into his ear, "Are you having a good time here?" 
"Yeah, I guess so." After looking around the room, he added, 
"Where have I been for the last three years?" 
"What?" I asked. 
"I mean, I don't know any of these people," he confessed. 
"Why are you here then?" 
He sounded ready for the question. "There are three reasons 


to come to parties like this," and he began 
to list them: "First, there's the dancing-
but I really don't feel like dancing because 
I feel a little stupid dancing in front of 
people I don't know. The second is the 
_ drinking, but I don't feel like drinking 
~ tonight. And third is to meet women-" 
~ 
"-to hook up, right?" I prodded. 
"Yeah, these parties are great if you

I realized that he was not going to be 
·~ my connection. At this party there was 
~ nothing to connect to. I sought out the 
~ host and tried to pin him down. "How 
~many of these people do you actually 
~ know?" I demanded. 
He looked up to survey the room and 
then bent down to shout in my ear, 
"Maybe 15 percent." He looked around 
the room again and leaned down. 
"Maybe." 

M 
y trip to the Beach Club was a 
self-conscious attempt to locate 
the mainstream at Yale. Instead, 
I found that I had become disconnected 
from any central Yale social scene. For the 
past semester, the parties I had been going 
to were usually small gatherings of people 
who all knew each other. But what 
seemed co connect them was the sense 
that there was a larger, more homogenous 
group of "normal" Yalies that these parties 
were most defiantly not. 

A few nights after the Beach Club's 
Tequila Monday, I went to the release 
party for the Yale Literary Magazine, held 
at its designer's Park Street apartment. 
Everyone was reading the freshly printed 
magazines. I spotted the box of issues on 
the floor next to a table crowded with 
martini fixings and a jug of red wine. 
Wandering partygoers moved through the 
kitchen. People stayed only as long as 
they wanted, until they finished making 
their drinks or tired of the company. In 
the living room, the groupings were more 
permanent. Ashes grew long on the 
Dunhills of the people seated on the 
couches, chairs, and floors. Conversations 
drew on as one topic was exhausted and 
another began. It was poetic. 

Few introductions were necessary; 
invitations had been taped to the Yale 
Station mailboxes of people associated 
with the magazine. Most of the people 
had come to see their published work or 
that of their friends. There was no social 
tension because the crowd was self-
selected. The only challenge of coming to 
an event like this was to set myself apart 
in a room full of people so much like 
myself. Even so, the only way to be sure 
of my own individuality was to ground it 
in the common understanding of the 
people around me. Being with people that 
were like me was comfortable, but it 
struck me that this scene was a bit 
ridiculous. This is not what· mainstream 
Yale does for fun. The rest of Yale was out 
there, I thought, but if I was going to 
find it, I would have to go beyond these 
apartment walls. 

ass media images of college life 
tell me that the mainstream 
flows down frat row. On 
television and in movies, the most often 
depicted and recognized image of a 
college student is a kid in a sweatshirt 
bearing Greek letters. 
I 
haven't 
encountered that kid at Yale, yet. But I 
thought maybe there was truth to the 
stereotype, and I should venture out to 
Lake Place. 

The Sigma Nu Black Light Party was 
not my first opportunity, but it was the 
first time I mustered the nerve to accept a 
public invitation to a party thrown by a
