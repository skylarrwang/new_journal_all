**Culture in the Streets**
**Author: Thr Editors**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Popular culture resists definition. 

Popular culture is messy and residual. 

Popular culture is constantly on the move. 

Cultural critic Stuart suggests chat, in our ostensibly postmodern era, posrmodernism itself "is nor cultural epoch, at Tht Ntw journal believe that popular culture is, co use Hall 's metaphor, culture in the streets. It is the traffic of our daily lives and it is the road on which this traffic runs. We maneuver, take detours, stall, hotwire, fall asleep at the wheel, wake up with a jolt. The traffic is swift; popular culture blurs before our eyes. 

The articles in this issue attempt to map the cultural streets that lie beyond the classrooms and offices of Yale and New Haven. Popular culture surges forward at breakneck speeds, accelerating for the turn onto the highway of the twenty-first century. Despite this fin-tk-sieck rush, the essence of popular culture can still be glimpsed in the rearview muror. 

We at Tht Ntw journal were compelled to take to the roads of popular culture: out of our living rooms, beyond the sophisticated crudity of Tht Simpsons, the paranoid bewilderment of the X-Filrs, and the adolescent reminiscences of Party of Fivr. These television tidbits comprise predictable pares of mass media, but popular culture often occupies unexpected spaces-casinos, fraternities, crumbling movie houses, talk shows, and arcs festivals. 

The articles in chis issue can no more represent popular culture chan a series of pithy com-mentaries on prime-time television. Publishing a special issue, there is always the temptation, on the one hand, to be exhaustive in our coverage of the chosen topic. On the ocher hand, there is also the worry char the issue will simply become an encyclopedic taxonomy. Instead, we have located ourselves within the scenes of our everyday lives, and, consequently, we have found a place for ourselves in popular culture. These articles record our experiences with the stop-and-go narure of culture in the streets-the traffic jams, the collisions, the men at work. They expose, finally, a dilemma for the writer: poised between viewing and partici-pating, between policies and pleasure, he or she must be willing to embrace ambivalence.

**Cult Classics**
**Author: Lorm Brody**
**Page number(s): 5**

Backstage, Jason Weinberger (CC '96, MUS '97) walked past me nervously as he hurried to warm up for his clarinet performance. I knew him as the charismatic conductor of the Jonathan Edwards Chamber Orchestra. Now an assisrant conductor for the Yale Symphony Orchestra (YSO), Weinberger took the stage of Sprague Memorial Hall for his recital, a requirement for his master's degree in music. His body swayed to Max Reger's Sonata in f minor, Op. 49, No.2. 

I had never heard of Max Reger. 

Weinberger was also going to perform a piece by the relatively unknown Alban Berg. 

Weinberger relished the chance to introduce more obscure classical pieces to people who probably would not otherwise have heard them. 

He had realized an odd duality about classical music at Yale. He stood atop a stage at times graced by the Tokyo String Quartet, in a city rich with a classical music tradition. Yet even in such an environment, most graduate and faculty concerts are poorly attended by undergraduates. Weinberger had exerted great effort to yield the 60-plus turnout. He and other classical musicians must find creative ways to attract tindergraduates willing to listen to more than Beethoven's Fifth. 

Yale both is and is not part of a downward trend in classical music. Faculty concerts are attended primarily by older New Haven residents. On the other hand, Yale Music Professor Craig Wright (Hon. MA '81) said Yale is probably the only university in the United States where an undergraduate symphony will have higher attendance than a basketball game. Yet Wright still fears that classical music is becoming less popular, especially among younger people. "The audience," Wright said, "keeps getting older and older." His music appreciation course is an attempt to revive interest in classical music among college students. 

The YSO concert most heavily attended by undergraduates is the Halloween concert, which often features a homemade movie, live acting, and popular music. Lisa Shufro (BK FEBRUARY 14, 1997 '95) recalled, "The bulk of the audience at other Yale Symphony concerts are not Yale students." In contrast, she described the orchestra's treatment when they played in Portugal for their 1995 spring trip. "Those people treated us like we were movie stars," she said. "Just-Please! autograph my program," university students there would beg her. This year, the orchestra has put forth an extra effort to attract undergraduates and has successfully drawn more students, YSO Manager Laurie Ongley said. 

The Yale-New Haven area follows a national trend in which rock music leads the popularity charts and classical music lags behind. 

One solution may be for classical musicians to perform repertoires that mix more popular pieces with less younger audiences. For one of Weinberger's chamber orchestra performances, psychology pro-fessor Peter Salovey narrated Sergei Prokofiev's "Peter and the Wolf." Weinberger then seized the chance to play one of Prokofiev's less popular works to the same audience. 

The classical music world at Yale is fighting a battle to stay within the bounds of mainstream culture. This struggle has meaning for Wright because of music's special place among the arts. "People have a universally more visceral, pro or con, response to music than to any of the other arts," he said. 

So what is at stake in the battle to save classical music other than the spiritual and aesthetic? "What else could there be?" Wright asked in return. "That's the very essence of life."

**Kick Starting Krank20**
**Author: Lainie Rutkuw**
**Page number(s): 5-6**

You wander into Store 24 searching for something to help you face the coming dawn. Their coffee is lukewarm at best, and pill-popping has never been your thing. You plod along, bleary-eyed, to the beverage cases, anticipating the syrupy comfort of a Coke. Then you spy the bottle. You're drawn towards its busy green and red label boasting "maximum caffeine" in yellow letters. 

Welcome to the Interstellar Beverage Company's fantasy of your initial encounter with Krank20, the world's first caffeinated water. 

Marketed as "the world's coolest caffeine delivery system," Krank20 offers more than a snazzy label to attract exhausted Gen-Xers. Promotional items abound, including stickers, posters, T-shirts, and the coveted "kranksta" rubber band gun. For the truly devoted, there is even a web site, complete with mascot Grinny and the "Krankee of the Week." 

Publicity continues through radio spots and fliers that declare, "Inside: Krank20 is manufactured using a proprietary process called '332ZIR,' which assures superior consistency, highest caffeine levels and great taste! Outside: Exciting graphics on the bottle and support materials set Krank20 apart from the crowd!" 

According to its distributors, Krank20 has met with sweeping success. Sold in 30 states, it can be found nearly everywhere, from military bases to universities. The Interstellar Beverage 3 Company receives ten to 15 calls per night praising the product, and its website boasts 8 10,000 hits a week. The company confidently claims that "after nearly two years in development, Krank20 Highly Caffeinated Water has emerged as the most exciting and intriguing functional food in today's beverage market." 

Included in its marketing literature is the following success story: "Yale University coffee shop sells three cases during the first night after delivery of a six-case order." 

An employee at Durfee's Sweet Shop confirms this story, saying, "Yes, it's true. But it was probably because our cooler was barely stocked with anything else. It was hot back in September, but now it's died off." The Durfee's cooler attests to this, as rows of Krank20 sit idly waiting while bottles of Snapple, Tropicana, and Poland Spring water are replaced almost hourly. 

Apparently, this is not unique to Durfee's. When presented with a bottle ofKrank20, the clerk at Krauszer's replied, "We don't sell much of that at all. See for yourself." He gestured toward a full cooler ofK.rank20 that remained virtually untouched the entire week. An employee at Quality Liquors echoed this sentiment, saying, "We used to sell it. We don't anymore. We ordered a couple of cases and sold about three bottles." 

Only the Store 24 clerk reported con-tinuous sales of Krank20, and these were mostly to students who were repeat buyers. It appears that these purchasers have reason to be satisfied; the product does taste like water and manages to deliver the effects of 100 milligrams of caffeine per 500 milliliters of water. But, these devotees comprise only the smallest minority ofYale students. 

For the vast majority of people in Krank20's 15- to 24-year-old target group, the product may as well not exist. As evidenced by its stagnant pre$ence on campus, "exciting graphics" and a website are not enough to convince consumers· that caffeinated water is anything more than a passing fad.

**Mythic Pizza**
**Author: Yuki Noguchi**
**Page number(s): 6**

A young man behind the counter at Pepe's Pizzeria sidesteps a pile of coal, adroitly whirling an enormous wooden oar. He flips open a narrow metal flap in the brick wall, pulls out a bubbling, thin crust pizza from the 12-squar'-foot oven, and lands it on an aluminum tray. 

"Specialty pizzas? Oh, we have so many ... " says Sal Montagna. Sal is a 57-year veteran pizza-maker for Pepe's. In a smock as white as his hair, he leans thoughtfully over the wooden counter. "White clam pizza-that's a big seller. Then we have the veggie special, special with anchovies, sausage and mushroom, pepperoni and mushroom ... " 

For most college towns, pizza places are as essential as bookstores, and more numerous. New Haven is no exception. Yale enjoys the rare privilege of being located in the home of the pizza, or at least the home of the nation's best. 

The aroma from Sally's and Pepe's ovens has wafted over the nation's collective nose, attracting a parade of famous fans. The Clintons (both as lowly students and as the lofty First Couple), Presidents Reagan and Kennedy, Danny DeVito, Tony Bennett, Frank Sinatra, and Paula Abdul are among the stars who have stamped a tomato-stained seal of approval on Wooster Square's pies. 

The walls of Sally's restaurant display gifts left by big-name clientele. One can dine on seasonal veggie pizza beside candid black-and-whites of Kennedy and Sinatra or take a gander at the Doonesbury rendition of a Sally's chef. Sally's most recent acquisition is the tennis racket with which Richard Krajikec won Wimbledon last year. "He comes here every night of his stay during the Pilot Pen tournament," says Flora Consiglio, the wife of the late founder of Sally's. 

Krajkec joins an army of devotees who pay regular homage to Wooster Square's pizza parlors-an army willing to weather hours of anticipation and salivation for their tasty reward. At 4 p.m., opening time for Pepe's, the tables are full. By 6 p.m., the line of customers extends out the door. Pepe's keeps its annex, site of the original Pepe's, as a reserve to handle the overflow. 

When Frank Pepe opened his pizzeria in 1925, pizza was still considered ethnic food. Consiglio says Pepe and his nephew Sal, who established Sally's in 1938, were among the first to make pizzas commercially. 

When Modern Pizza set up shop in 1934 and Sally's branched off from its father store, people speculated that the cause was a familial or culinary dispute. But Consiglio, who has never tasted pizza other than Sally's, refutes such rumors. "That's all just hearsay. We're all the best of friends." Evidently, pizza has been the focus of an impassioned urban myth. 

Any way you slice it, Sally's and Pepe's needn't be concerned about losing clientele to competition. Even if most collegiate connoisseurs choose Broadway, Yorkside, Town and Bar pizzas because of proximity, there are plenty of customers to go around. So long as presidents, tennis champs, pop stars and other die-hards-like the ones who fly into New Haven just for a pie-keep coming, Wooster Square will remain pizza's famed culinary home.

**Breaking Boundaries: The New Haven International Festival of Arts and Ideas**
**Author: Not specified**
**Page number(s): 7-8**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
I
nternational Festival of Arts and Ideas coordinators Anne
Calabresi, Roslyn Meyer (ES '71, MS '73, PhD '77), and
Elinor Biggs are in the business of breaking boundaries.
They battle against the social, economic, and geographic
segmentation that prevents New Haven from capitalizing on its
resources-namely, the city's location on the Eastern Seaboard,
its lively arts community, and its layout around the central New
Haven Green. They believe in breaking boundaries creatively,
using the arts as a means of melding these resources into a city
that will be attractive to residents and visitors alike. "We want
to create an air of vibrancy in New Haven and make it a place
people want to be year-round," Meyer says. The festival's
creators-Calabresi, Meyer, and businesswoman Jean
Handley-believe that to foster this environment, they must
eliminate divisions among New Haven's neighborhoods. They
see the festival as the ideal way to achieve this lofty goal. After
all, believes Calabresi, people are at their best when they are
playing and creating in the ways that the festival encourages
them to do.


At the inaugural festival last June, oversized papier-mache
figures from the Bread and Puppet Theatre towered over
toddlers who stared upwards in awe, actor-activist Ruben Blades
showcased his reputation as a world-class salsa musician, and
Native American singer Buffy Sainte-Marie performed folk
music on the New Haven Green's specially-constructed "World ~
Stage." Other artists set up shop on patches of sidewalk nearby, g
showing off their talents with magic tricks, juggling, or mime. ~
Pictures and videotapes of the festival lend support to the idea ~
of building bridges between New Haven's diverse ~
neighborhoods; each recorded event shows people of all ages ~
and ethnicities, swathed in brightly-colored shorts and T-shirts, ~
swinging their bodies to the music and clapping their hands in ~
excitement.


Despite New Haven's current reputation as a city stricken by ~
poverty, violence, and economic decline, Meyer, Calabresi, and g
festival executive director Biggs remain unruffled. In fact, they ~
are defiant. "New Haven is so underrated and overcriticized, it's ;;)
pathetic," Meyer says. "I came here in 1969, and I never left."


Yet festival organizers are aware that pessimistic media ~
coverage may dissuade potential attendees from New Haven's l>
::l.
suburbs and beyond. Jean Handley, the third festival co- :
founder, woke up sweating the night before its opening, g_
suffering nightmares that no one would appear for the Yale-New g:
Haven tours planned for the kickoff. Before the first tour, g:
however, a large crowd had already amassed. "There were people
waiting in line-moms with strollers!" Handley says excitedly,
her tone betraying her surprise. "On the tour, they saw
wonderful architecture and buildings that we pass blindly every
day. We have gotten so we do not see
what's good about the city, we look at the
things that need improving." Handley
has a more optimistic view of New
Haven's offerings. "I see it as a city with
great potential and, increasingly, others
see it that way, too. The governor already
refers to New Haven as the cultural
capital of the state." Part of the festival's
objective is to capitalize on the idea of
New Haven as a cultural center for the
East Coast. This will be aided by the
planned construction of a high-speed
train
between
New
Haven
and
Manhattan that will only encourage
visitors from the New York metropolitan
area, Calabresi says.


Biggs defends New Haven's ability to
become a renowned arts cent'Cr and
popular tourist destination. She sits in
the festival office, which opens onto a
view of the New Haven Green and Yale's
gothic Old Campus. Biggs waves her arm
in front of the windows, as if to pull back
a curtain and reveal a scene from last
summer's festival. "If I had looked out
this window during the festival, I would
have seen literally .thousands of people
walking around down there," she says.
Her tone is incredulous as she speaks of
parents and children walking hand in
hand on the Green after sunset. "Maybe
there were. only 20,000 people there, but
we changed their attitudes."


T
he road to Calabresi's farmhouse
runs down Whalley Avenue into
the town of Woodbridge, where
the street metamorphoses from a car
dealership mecca inco a wooded country
road. T he farmhouse tops a steep,
winding driveway that lets the driver
forget he or she is only moments from a
road leading direcdy back to New Haven.
Inside the house's blue and white
country kitchen, frantic energy abounds.
This room has probably seen the birth of
many of the ideas behind the festival's
creation. Calabresi plugs in an electric
teapot an d seats herself at the large
wooden table that dominates the floor
space. D ressed in a green suit and white
blouse, with a scarf draped across her
neck like a dishtowel and her blonde hair
in a loose French twist, she looks like a
1990s career woman in the home of an
1890s farmer's wife.


Calabresi, a founder of both L.E.A.P.
(Leadership, Education, Athletics in
Partnership) and the festival, has long
been recognized as a community leader
and advocate. She sees her work on the
festival's board of directors as one more
way of improving the quality of life in
New Haven. "I think of this as an
extension of working with inner-city
kids," she says, "because New Haven is
threadbare in terms of financial
resources."


Certain community members level
criticism at the festival for becoming an
event organized by the white elite for the
white elite, but Calabresi, Meyer, and
Biggs dismiss this claim as ridiculous.
Nevertheless, in raising funds for what
they hope will become an internationaJiy
renowned festival, the organizers'
connections have proven advantageous.
"I knew I could go to Paul Newman to
ask for money for the arts," Calabresi
says. She readily admits that if someone
from Newhallville showed up at
Newman's door, he or she would not
have the same luck.


H
eading in the opposite direction
out of New Haven's center, Elm
Street becomes Grand Avenue
and leads to Centro San Jose. It curls
across railroad cracks and past storefronts
that display equal parts Spanish and
English. Centro San Jose itself, a social
services and youth center that primarily
serves New Haven's Hispanic population,
looks abandoned from the outside. Its
graffiti-covered, red-paneled walls and
the small sign propped in the window do
not distinguish it from the rest of the
block. Inside, a cramped room holds a
desk and two buckets to catch runoff
from the leaky ceiling. Despite the
buckets, a pool has formed on the
desktop and caused the vinyl to buckle.
A larger, rectangular room serves as
the main recreational area. The room has
a linoleum floor and no windows. A
handful of children scamper around,
bouncing between a makeshift stage and
a ping-pong table. They chatter in a
mixture of Spanish and English and lick

event to areas beyond the Green. 
Organizer Bitsie Clark sees Audubon 
Street as ideal for this. Despite what 
some might term high-class architecture 
and storefronts and the area's placement 
on the outskirts of downtown, Clark 
does not perceive Audubon Street as an 
exclusive area of the city. "The viewpoint 
of people is that it's a place where arts 
take place," she says, noting that 
ArtSpace, Educational Center for the 
Arts, Foundry Music, and the Arts 
Council all make their homes on the 
single city block. 

Centro San Jose did make it to 
Audubon Street for the International 
Festival offshoot. The center participated 
in Art on the Edge through its after-
school drumming group. Long rehearsals 
with a professional drummer ensured a 
successful performance, Noble says, 
though he does not feel the group needed 
to prove itself to others. "We were 
looking to make sure that people know 
what's going on in other neighborhoods. 
We're not going to come back to this 
neighborhood and be judged," he says. 
"But people were curious to see what we 
were about, and I guess in that way there 
was some pressure." 

Jennifer Rivas, a 13-year-old sixth 
grader in the drumming group, wears 
baggy jeans and a mustard yellow 
T-shirt and keeps her long brown hair in 
a ponytail. She talks about "touching," a 
colloquialism for drumming. "We 
touched, we danced. It was fun," she says 
smiling a wide-mouthed grin. Before Art 
on the Edge, Jennifer had never been to 
Audubon Street. Now, she shrugs and 
says, "Yeah, it's nice there." 

Eventually, International Festival 
organizers hope to expand Art on 
the Edge to other neighborhoods 
in New Haven. Noble would welcome an 
Art on the Edge festival in his area. 
Attendance at such a festival, however, 
depends on the community's accessibility. 
For Noble, accessibility relies more on 
logistical dilemmas than on overcoming 
racial or socio-economic obstacles. "If 
people feel the arts or other activities are 
important, they will come here. But we 
need to resolve the transportation issue 


--- Page 11 ---

first," he says in his characteristically 
subdued tone. 

The idea of fringe festivals in New 
Haven's various neighborhoods is not a 
new one, according to Art on the Edge 
organizer Clark. "It has been done in the 
past and it could easily be revived," she 
says, adding chat Art on the Edge would 
benefit from incorporating the echnicity 
of neighborhoods such as Fairhaven and 
Wooster Square into its programs. She 
hesitates to do chis immediately after the 
Festival's birth, however. "We have to be 
careful chat we don't bite off more than 
we can chew at first," Clark says 
pragmatically. Expansion of Art on the 
Edge is not a one-way street. Noble says 
the issue of attracting audiences to 
neighborhoods such as the Hill works in 
reverse as well; the residents of the 
neighborhoods must be attracted to the 
idea of celebrating the arts. The people 
who frequent Centro San Jose, for 
instance, sometimes need convincing that 
such an event benefits themselves and 
their families. "Our approach is to try to 
explain co people chat these activities are 
different, but worthwhile," says Noble. 

For 
now, 
festival 
organizers 
concentrate on 
establishing 
the 
International Festival and Art on the 
Edge as successful annual events in New 
FEBRUARY 14, 1997 
Haven. They also focus on crossing the 
boundaries that prevent everyone in New 
Haven from participating. Calabresi's 
welcoming speech at the festival made 
clear the double goal of spearheading a 
regeneration of New Haven's arts 
tradition and using that tradition to form 
a city-wide community. "Let us welcome 
to our extraordinary city our visitors," 
she urged Festival attendants last June. 
"Let us shake a stranger's hand and say, 
'Thank you and welcome to our future."' 
Her words belonged co the scene: the 
Green , in the midst of summer, with 
toddlers screeching in delight, and snow-
cones dripping onto a patchwork of 
picnic blankets. In mid-February, the 
words sound canned, as though a speech-
writer jotted them down half-an-hour 
before showtime. Walking the streets of 
New Haven, no one remarks on 
boundaries that have been broken or 
bridges that have been crossed since last 
June. Yet the Festival continues its effort 
to form a cohesive New Haven through 
the arts, even as the neighborhoods 
themselves remain on the edge of the 
effort to eliminate boundaries within the 
city's borders.

**Talk Shows**
**Author: Joel Burges**
**Page number(s): 12**

Talk shows are definitely a curiosity. One of the criticisms of talk shows is 
that they make the lowest, most extreme instances of lift seem 
commonplace. In a sense, that's what makes it interesting. I mean, most 
people are intrigued by a woman sleeping with 100 men in a year. I 
mean, it's kind of sick. 
-Lynn Kessler (SY '98) 

n New York City one day last winter, playing hooky from 
school, I found myself encircled by enormous photographs of 
Ricki Lake. She was everywhere, colonizing three of the four 
walls in the waiting room of the Ricki Lake Show. Her larger-
than-life smile flashed at me, her teeth dazzled an airbrushed white, 
her pastel clothes complemented her Slim-Fasted figure. Her iconic 
image soothed my truant's heart: my decision to skip "Edith 
Wharton and the Problem of America" had been the right one. 

About to enter the sound stage, I thought about the obstacles I 
had overcome to be within arm's reach of Riclci. My two friends and 
I maneuvered through a series of checkpoints before gaining 
entrance to the waiting room. On the street, we proved we were at 
least 18, and presented our fluorescent lime-green tickets for that 
day's episode. In the lobby, our names were checked against a master 
list of those who misbehaved on the show before: either by calking 
back to Riclci, using the strictly forbidden audio or video recording 
devices on the sound stage, or chewing gum while cameras were 
rolling. Riclci establishes her authority with the tender severity of a 
Victorian governess. 

My friends and I boarded the elevator and ascended to the final 
checkpoint. Stepping out of the elevator, I joined a line where guards 
checked my bags for weaponry, and my body was scanned by a metal 
detector. I hoped the knitting needles I was carrying would not 
alarm the guards. I wouldn't dream of harming Riclci in any way. 
Riclci's "Rules of Order" dictate that her authority not be questioned. 
So there I was, in the waiting room dominated by Ricki's image. 
I was disturbed. I had been thoroughly disarmed. While succumbing 
to Riclci's codes, I began to realize that being on a talk show, like 
participating in any cultural event, has an etiquette both formulaic 
and freaky in its idiom, an idiom both policing and populist in its 
ideology. 

Adoption of the etiquette, idiom, and ideology of talk-show 
culture is growing more common among Yale undergraduates. 
Leaving behind the study of mass media, students find themselves 
participating in the cultural practices they usually only talk about in

peoples of color, closeted gays, and other marginalized compatriots 
of the television nation. 

I went to Ricki because, one, I knew Ricki was a step above Gordon 
Elliot. Two--now this wiLl sound paternalistic-! foe/ it can never hurt 
to have a sane, level-headed individual in the audience. 
-Maria, an anonymous undergraduate 

Lynn Kessler, who organized Saybrook College's October 25, 
1996, trip to the Ricki Lake Show, lied to her contacts at the 
show. When they asked if the group of Saybrugians were 
"ethnically diverse," she passed us off as such. 

Curious to see what it would be like to accompany a large group 
to a talk show, after my experience with only two friends last year, I 
found myself standing on Elm Street. I was waiting for the bus that 
would take me back to Ease 37th Streer-and Ricki. On the bus, we 
theorized about what the day's topic would be; Ricki keeps ir top 
secret until cameras are rolling and taping has begun. Bur Ricki is 
known for her tongue-twisting, tabloid-like titles, so we knew our 
FEBRUARY 14, 1997 
efforts co our-think her were in vain. 

Maria, an undergraduate who wished to have her name changed 
for this article, only hoped the episode wouldn't be a tearjerker. On iJi= 
her first talk-show trip with Saybrook College in the spring of 1996, ~ 
she went to the Gordon Elliot Show. The sexy title, "MY LITTLE. i 
PRINCESS IS NO ANGEL," did not prepare her for the seriousness of the ~ 
topic at hand. Gordon's attitude towards his diabolic princesses ~ 
horrified her, along with many of the other Saybrugians present. -;}. 
Gordon accused a teenage girl of being responsible for her own rape i 
because of the way she dressed. 

Looking back, Maria was disgusted by Gordon's paternalistic § 
reprimand of an adolescent rape victim: "I really realized that half~ 
the time the people on the show are being exploited. When it's § 
children being exploited, it's unbearable to watch." Maria explained, ~ -
"Children don't have the ability to stand up for themselves. When 2_ 
there is a room full of adultS screaming at them that their rape was ~ 
their fault, what are they going to think? It's nor a healthy siruation." ~ 
She further commented, "I thought about going on a crusade to go ~ 
to as many talk shows as possible, to give some some sort of support i 
to the guests." Like a nineteenth-century Protestant reformer, a~ 
woman fighting against child labor in factories and advocating ~
legislated temperance, Maria wished to 
teach the audience a lesson about 
compassion. 

But it wasn't Maria's reformist zeal that 
led her to step aboard the bus. carrying the 
Saybrugians to the Ricki Lake Show last 
October. Instead, it was that ~icki was 
Maria's kindred spirit, striving towards a 
common goal. She felt a bond of sisterhood 
with Ricki, for the host had the good 
manners to empathize with her guests. After 
all, Ricki is a talk-show success story herself 
She went from everyone's favorite fat girl in 
Hairspray and on China Beach, to the 
slimmer, trimmer Queen of Talk Shows, to 
displaying herself as the expectant mother of 
daytime television this past fall. For Maria, 
this talk show host is not guilty of Gordon's 
sexist condescension, but of a gender 
paternalism. Forcefully, Maria suggested to 
me, "Why don't we call it maternalism?" 

Maria's suggestion foreshadowed what 
Saybrook witnessed when we arrived at 
Ricki's .studio in New York City. After we 
satisfied Ricki's demand for docility at her 
various checkpoints- by now I was feeling 
like an old hand at this-we waited 
patiently until we were called to line up for 
seating. At the door leading to the sound 
stage, each guest was handed a trinket, a key 
chain bearing Ricki's name, to remind us of 
our trip to the Ricki Lake Show. I still carry 
mine with me, as do any number of other 
Saybrugians. 

Once inside the sound stage, we were 
entertained by a comedian, who kept us 
pacified and amused until the episode's 
topic was announced and Ricki showed 
herself. I felt a little bit like I was at a child's 
birthday party, waiting for a mother to 
arrive with a cake covered by flickering 
candles. Soon, the long-awaited topic was 
revealed, a kind of "best of the Ricki Lake 
Show': "WE FOUGHT ON RICKJ BEFORE ... BUT 
NOW WE'RE BACK TO SETTLE THE SCORE!" 
The audience loved what the title promised. 
When Ricki stepped onto the sound stage, 
we became frenzied. As I clapped 
passionately in the name of Ricki's arrival, I 
thought that Maria must be pleased by the 
topic. It suggested controlled chaos, not 
Gordon's judgmental aggression. 

During the opening moments of the 
episode, Ricki read a letter. It was from a 
woman who had ap.peared on an earlier 
Ricki Lake Show to resolve her differences 
with her negligent mother. Her mother, 
refusing to communicate with her even afrer 
the show, left her daughter orphaned in the 
wide, wide world. Saddened by the plight of 
this wayward girl, Ricki informed the 
audience that though her biological mother 
had failed her, Ricki had not. Like a 
surrogate mother, Ricki kept in touch with 
the girl-fulfllling Maria's reformist vision 
of talk-show maternalism. 

I find them amusing. Sometimes they bring on 
freaks-weLl, not freaks. People that will 
amuse you, for shock value. 
-Lynn Kessler 

''F reaks, Lynn! They're freaks! " 
Martha Surridge (SY '98) 
exclaimed, pointing at the "self-
proclaimed .freaks" strutting through the 
studio audience, handing out carnations to 
audience members, making their way onto 
the stage for the final segment of the 
October 25, 1996, Ricki Lake Show. All four 
of the freaks-couples Eric and Judy, Nile 

and Bridget-had appeared on an earlier 
episode of the talk show, entitled, "yo BRO! 
YOU THINK I LOOK LIKE A CIRCUS FREAK, 
BUT YOU ' RE A MAJOR GEEK!" The two 
couples were back to update Ricki about 
their lives, which seemed to have little to do 
with the topic at hand. Instead, they were 
there to display their outrageous 
appearances, a spectacle of self-fashioned 
freakiness to be paraded before a gawking, 
gleeful audience. ·· 

Bridget, who lives with Nile in the 
house of her major geek of a brother, looked 
like a trendy, urban mermaid. Shimmering 
like a piece of light blue tinfoil, Bridget's 
dress matched her blue-green hair and 
eyebrows; her aquamarine lipstick was laid 
on thick and magnificent. She wore a pair 
of sleek and shiny, knee-high patent leather 
boots; they resonated with the black spots 
on the leopard collar of her pale blue dress. 
Nile, her companion, had dyed his hair a 
flaming orange, shaping his coiffure into 
spikes the shape of ice cream cones. 
Wearing a leopard-print jacket reminiscent 
of Bridget's collar, Nile was dressed all in 
black, in sharp contrast to his deathly pale 
skin, which looked like it had been 
powdered with the layers of white cosmetics 
used by nobility in seventeenth-century 
French courts. 

Eric and Judy were similarly outlandish. 
Eric's hair glowed ferocious magenta and 
Auoresent green, his clothes screamed plaid, 
and piercings covered his face. There was a 
metal spike through his nose, and his 
earlobes had been stretched around large 
wooden earrings. His girlfriend, Judy, wore 
platform sneakers and a floor-length dress 
covered with blue sequins. During his 
earlier appearance on the Ricki Lake Show, 
Eric talked about the problems his father 
had with his failure to conform. After that, 
Eric explained, "My Dad realized I wasn't 
joking about how I looked." This brief tale 
of filial reunion was all we heard before 
Ricki wrapped up the show, telling her four 
"self-proclaimed freaks" how they had 
served their purpose: "You've cheered up my 
day." 

Ricki wasn't the only one amused by her 
guests. The Saybrugians found the talk 
show just as entertaining. Ricki and her 
show also filled a void. Lynn reflected, 
"Coming from Yale, you're like-you're 
different from the talk show audience. lc's 
kind of fun being in the talk show 
environment because it's so different. It's a 
lot more emotional." She continued, "On 
talk shows, people don't have discussions, 
they scream at each other. It's frenzied." 

Lynn saw the Ricki Lake Show as an 
opportunity for Yale undergraduates, 
otherwise controlled and contained, to go a 
Little bit crazy, to be children under Ricki's 
watchful eyes. 

Presiding over this cultural space, Ricki 
draws in not only "freaks" but also those 
who want to view them. For Lynn, viewing 
is about learning emotion; for Maria, it's 
about teaching compassion. They both 
went to the talk show expecting to 
experience a real-world classroom. But they 
failed to recognize themselves as the 
outsiders-becoming the freaks themselves. 
In the talk show's idiom of freakiness, it is 
Lynn, Maria, and myself who finally don't 
belong.

**When the City Was a Silver Screen**

In the Elm City's cinematic heyday, New Haven and Hollywood 
converged on downtown's bygone movie houses. 
When _the City Was 
a Silver Screen 
B 
ig A1 sit; behind the night· manager's desk in the lobby 
• 
of the Hotel Duncan. Dorothea Moore stands behind 
the bar at the Anchor Bar and Restaurant. They . begi~ 
their parallel tales with, "Once upon a time there were 
six great picture palaces in New H aven. And they were 
splendid ... " 

With that auspicious opening these long-time New Haven 
citizens and film-lovers recount everything they know about 
cinema and this city. They talk for hours, sometimes pulling out 
• photographs or backtracking to correct a date, to tell you that it 
was Katherine Hepburn and not Bette Davis who starred in 
1942's Women of the Year. 

Dorothea and Big A1 didn't just go catch a flick at the Bijou 
Dream Theater. They ingested movies. They lived through them, 
and through them they built their identities. Here is Big Al, not 
as a hotel desk clerk, but as a debonair Johnny from the Rita 
Hayworth noir classic, Gilda. Here, too, is Dorothea, not as a 
cocktail waitress, but as Gilda herself-sudden, vicious, and 
tragic. 

D 
orothea runs the Anchor, where suburbanites and Yalies 
stop for a drink after a show at the Shubert, itself a one-
rime movie theater. Throughout her day, she cites 
dialogue from All About Eve as if it were a sacred text 

When All About Eve opened at the Paramount on Temple 
Street in 1950, Dorothea convinced her boyfriend, "a blonde-
haired fellow, not too good-looking, but nice," to take her to the 
very first screening. He picked her up at her parents' home off 
16 
Richard Kim 
Prospect Street and escorted her to the nearest trolley station. 
· True to the fashion of the time, Dorothea wore white gloves and 
a hat. Her boyfriend took her arm and walked between her and 
the street, protecting her from traffic and other urban menaces. 

As patrons filed into the theater, a large organ and an aspiring 
young pianist were lifted up on a platform in front of the screen. 
Dorothea admits that this was often her favorite part of the 
evening. She relished the glamour of having a uniformed usher 
escort her to a seat, and then listening to the organ spin out 
classical and popular music while watching everyone else take 
their seats. 

All About Eve had a special importance to its New Haven 
viewers. A portion of the film was staged and shot in the Elm 
City. Over a static shot of the corner of Chapel and College 
streets, the narrator, an uppity English theater critic, remarks, 
"New Haven. Con-nec-ti-cut. To the theater world a small strip ., 
of sidewalk between the Shubert Theater and the Taft Hotel." g 
Like most residents of New Haven, Dorothea delighted in this ~ 
reference to her hometown, regardless of its derisive tone. ~ 
"Usually, we were very polite at the theater. Everyone back then ~ 
was nicer and had a sense of decency, but when New Haven ~ 
came up, everyone let out a cheer." 

~ 
When the show concluded, Dorothea and her date walked ~ 
over to Liggett's Drug Store on the corner of Church and Chapel ~ 
streets. T hey had sodas, chatted with friends, and listened to ~ 
some hit records. Then the blonde-haired, not too good-looking ~ 
young man escorted Dorothea home and kissed her once before ~ 
. 
, 
~m~ 


Years later, when workmen were 
converting the Taft Hotel into an 
apartment building, they mentioned to 
Dorothea that they were gutting the 
famous room where scenes from All About 
Eve were filmed. To the bewilderment of 
her husband and co-workers, Dorothea 
rushed out of the Anchor, crossed the 
tightly cordoned construction lines, and 
climbed in high heels to the top of a 
dumpster where she begged the foreman 
to give her the mantle piece from Eve 
· Harrington's room. He knew exactly what 
she was talking about and wrapped a 
piece of it in his jacket for her to take 
home. "I chink it's somewhere in my 
garage," she says now. 

Dorothea breaks off her story to hand 
two customers their checks. She turns 
back around to give this final invective, 
"Then that Mayor Richard Lee came 
along with all those modern ideas we call 
improvements ... But things were more 
elegant then. Simpler. Quieter. Before all 
the noise." Dorothea tells of trying to 
find the corner where the old l.'aramount 
stood, but none of the office buildings 
now there mesh with her idealized. past. 
"They all look alike, you know." 

A
mong newspapers clippings and 
yellowing photographs, Big AI 
points to a picture of a quintet of 
serious looking businessmen. The only 
one smiling is a short and slightly oily-
looking man with a handlebar mustache 
standing in the center. Meet one of the 
forgotten founding fathers of American 
cinema, New Haven's own S. Z. Poli. 

Although he's been dead for over half a 
century, Mr. Poli is always addressed in 
the formal. 

Poli purchased the American Theater 
(formerly St. Mary's Church) in 1893 and 
converted it into one of the largest 
theaters in New England. An intuitive 
and brash entrepreneur, Poli may have 
been the first American to show a film for 
entertainment purposes. In early 1896, 
between acts of Vaudeville theater, Poli 
experimented with French cinematograph 
reels. By the summer of 1897, at Poli's 
Bijou Dream Theater, New Haven 
residents paid less than a nickel to watch 
the debut of Gr~at American Biograph: 
18 
The Ride Through Haverstraw TunneL. 

Advertisements from a turn-of-the-
century New Haven Evening Register tout 
the theater's "fairyland waterfall encased 
in a crystal staircase and luxurious marble 
foyer." An enormous success, profits from 
the Bijou Dream Theater, "the house of 
cinema hits," allowed Poli to acquire a 
space across the street which he named 
after himself, the Poli Theater. 

Already a millionaire, Poli purchased 
one theater after another, some as far 
away as Washington, D.C. and Worcester, 
Massachusetts. When Poli retired in 
1928, he had assembled a chain of 28 
theaters which stretched across the 
Eastern Seaboard and were rivaled in 
opulence only by New York's and Los 
Angeles's picture palaces. In that same 
year, he remodeled the Hyperion Theater 
on Chapel Street, renaming it the College 
Theater. Of Poli's three New Haven 
theaters, only the College stands today, a 
gutted and vacant shell. 

He eventually sold most of his 
theaters to the Fox Corporation and the 
Loews Corporation for a reported $30 
million. With those funds, he built a 
series of mansions in Milford for himself 
and his daughters: Then Mr. Poli, a man 
whose theaters were artfully integrated 
with lower level cafes and shops, a man 
who 
intimately 
understood 
the 
importance of crowds and pedestrian 
traffic, accomplished the most prophetic 
feat of his life-he built a private movie 
theater for his family. 

F 
rom a leather-bound scrapbook Big 
AI produces a photograph of the 
exterior of Loew's Poli Theater. An 
over-sized 
light-bulb 
letterboard 
dominates the scene. "Disney's Fantasia," 
it shines. As if the lights weren't enough 
to draw a passerby's attention, two men 
dressed in fedoras and trench coats point 
up to rhe sign. When Fantasia opened in 
1942, Big AI was just a child. It was one 
of his first experiences at the movies. He's 
been a dedicated connoisseur ever since. 

Big AI does not follow worldly events 
or speak foreign languages. He's content 
to occupy the world along the few blocks 
from his house to his work. He's happiest 
when he's squirreling through his 
scrapbooks, crying to locate a certain 
photograph and getting lost in a 
forgotten newspaper clipping along the 
way. A natural but untrained historian, 
Big AI's instinct told him to start saving 
these scraps of paper: advertisements, 
ticket stubs, flyers, posters, photographs, 
and newspaper clippings, anything which 
might preserve his experiences at the 
movies. "I just couldn't throw these things 
away. " 

He points to a photograph. "Do you 
wane me to show you the old Paramount 
cheater? Nobody appreciates these things 
anymore," Big AI says. 

By the mid-1970s the Roger Sherman 
RKO and the College Theater were the 
last of New Haven's downtown picture 
palaces. Both of them began to cater to 
audiences that were younger, mostly 
black, and usually male. Blaxploitation 
films, reggae documentaries, violent 
science fiction works, and pornography-
these movies were common fare for the 
College in particular. Big AI remembers 
when the College played its last film, Evil 
Knievel, in 1977. Big AI could not bear to 
attend. 

Big AI picks up a newspaper clipping, 
an article about the 'College Theater's 
demise. He shakes his head. And then 
with sudden vigor, he clutches one of his 
scrapbooks and says, "What's a guy to do? 
What's a guy to do these days with all of 
this?" Surrounded by sheaves of yellowing 
paper, he's unable to maintain a single 
thread of conversation. As he uncovers an 
interesting photograph, he jumps from 
past to present and chen retreats 
backwards in time. 

I 
t was a week before the Christmas of 
1952: a young Big AI walked into his 'll 
favorite theater, the Poli, right across g 
the street from the Bijou. Despite their~ 
proximity, the Poli and the Bijou did not~ 
compete for audiences. If the Bijou was ~ 
an elegant beauty, then the Poli was a ~ 
handsome bachelor. It tended to show~ 
serious dramas, continuing to play~ 
newsreels even after television had made ~

his friends had time for movies during the 
holiday season. Afterwards he walked to 
Malley's department store to shop for 
presents. What he wanted most for 
Christmas that year was a television set. 
Big AI sensed that everyone was getting 
them in those days. And he was right. 
Within eight years, almost 90 percent of 
New Haven households would have a 
working set.


Following Big Al's directions to the 
old College Theater, my friend 
Andrew and I bolt down Chapel 
Street, pausing once in my room to get a 
flashlight, a tape recorder, and some rope. 
Excited by the spirit of adventure, we take 
some steadying shots of whiskey to help 
us get past the imposing "No Trespassing" 
signs. Embarking on what promises to be 
an intrepid historical excavation, we force 
our way into the old theater. It is no easy 
task; at moments the danger and fright 
are enough to warrant our hushed tones. 
Since the building receives little sunlight 
during the day, the temperature inside the 
College hovers several degrees below 
freezing at night. A thin sheet of ice 
covers all exposed surfaces, making 
climbing over piles of rusted metal, fallen 
bricks, and chunks of plaster molding 
genuinely treacherous. When we finally 
reach the center of the crumbling shell, 
Andrew and I are covered in dirt, 
cobwebs, and strands of red curtain. The 
flashlight's thin, watery beam only 
permits glimpses of twisted metal shapes 
hanging ominously from the ceiling and 
overturned seats impeding our path, their 
cushions rotting with mold and moisture. 
Even in the dark, the great silver screen, 
now faded off-white with a fine dusting 
of din and soot, dominates our view. It's 
center has been cut away in jagged strips. 
Andrew says, "I have nightmares about 
spaces like this. " Silence. Beat, beat. 
Silence. The flutter of wings in the rafters 
sets us on our toes, and a lone pigeon's 
coo is enough to eject us from the 
building, running and screaming and 
laughing.


When I return the next day, I am both 
surprised and disappointed. There is 
light, and I am alone. Instead of catching 
only patches of decay, the entire 
enormous space opens to me. The theater 
is far larger than I expected, far more 
impressive in scope and mass. But after 
my initial awe passes, I only notice the 
empty beer cans, candy bar wrappers, 
flattened Kodak film boxes, and plastic 
grocery bags that litter the floor. After a 
casual inspection, I note that both the 
seat cushions and the curtains are made of 
maroon polyester cloth, not red velvet. 
One wall is papered with a pattern that 
resembles a Wonder Bread bag, all candy-
colored circles on a white plane. Surely, 
this could not be the theater of Big Al's 
memories? That, that's some other 
theater, I think.


The history of movie theaters in 
New Haven is as fleeting as a series 
of images projected on a screen; 
there's no substance to it, no depth. It 
can't be found in the tangible artifacts. It's 
not in the architecture, the photographs, 
or the history books. Big AI and 
Dorothea tint their recollections with 
nostalgia and bitterness. If you want facts, 
you can't trust their tales. The films 
themselves are all available on videotape, 
but what good are they without the 
crowds, trolley cars, and soda fountains? 
What's worse is that the city's busy streets 
conspire to keep the College hidden, to 
conceal from view what should be its 
looming presence over the downtown 
landscape. A_ person might attend Yale for 
four years and everyday walk down 
Chapel Street to buy a paper at 
NewsHaven and a cup of coffee at 
Willoughby's. Everyday this person could 
pass both the College Theater hidden 
behind the Union League Cafe and the 
deserted lot behind Laura Ashley where 
the Roger Sherman RKO stands, and he 
would never know either place existed. 
A culture that is primarily visual 
leaves no trace of its passage. It is 
unrecordable. Knowing this, it's still 
possible to get fragments of narratives, to 
imagine a grander architecture from the 
imprints of a crumbling building, and to 
reconstruct a small look at the past-
albeit inevitably colored by the present, 
by nostalgia and television and regret. li31

A reporter ventures into the college social scene 
in search of where the "normal" Yalie parties. 
The Two-Party System 
W
en I walked into the Beach Club, Silliman roo~ 
805, the first thing I noticed was the shot table. 
t was slicked with tequila, reflecting the pale, 
_ lectric-blue light of a neon beer sign. One of the 
hosts of the party, identifiable by his yellow construction hat, 
was filling disposable plastic shot glasses to the brim with 
noxious, cheap liquor. I arrived early and didn't know anyone in 
the room. I hadn't planned to get drunk on a school night, but, 
feeling a little awkward, I went up to one of the two kegs set in 
the middle of the room to pour myself a drink. 
I asked the host about the occasion for his party. 
_ 
"It's Tequila Monday," he told me. "It's a tradition, but it 
~ hasn't been respected in the past because old Beach Clubs have 
~sucked." The current residents of this suite are determined to 
~ restore the Club to its former glory as a non-exclusive tequila 
! free-for-all, a club whose only membership requirement is the 
~ willingness to get plastered on a Monday night. 
·~ 
This Monday, the first of the semester, there were plenty of 
~ partygoers willing to revive the tradition. As successive waves of 
~ people arrived, the only thing they seemed to have in common 
~was their lack of school work. The stereo in the corner pumped 
~ out an eclectic assortment of dance music. When the Chemical 
if Brothers came on, the composition of the dance floor changed 
FEBRUARY 14, 1997 
dramatically. Those who had been dancing to A Tribe Called 
Quest froze awkwardly and got out of the way. 

By 11 p.m., the place was packed. The room, which looked 
enormous when I first arrived, was suddenly claustrophobicaJly 
small. There was a long line at the keg, and a steady rhythm had 
developed at the tequila table: salt-shot-lemon-grimace, salt-shot-
lemon-grimace, salt-shot-lemon-grimace. I tried to navigate the 
crowd, keeping a lookout for a familiar face. I had hoped to find 
someone I knew who could introduce me to the current 
members of the Club. Occasionally I saw someone from a lecture 
or section and exchanged a few words, but no one seemed to 
belong there. I watched people make eye contact, experience a 
brief flicker of recognition, and move on. They seemed more 
engaged with the tequila than with their conversations. 

I bumped into a guy from a seminar whom I knew 
marginally at best. He looked as lost as I did. I leaned forward 
and yelled into his ear, "Are you having a good time here?" 
"Yeah, I guess so." After looking around the room, he added, 
"Where have I been for the last three years?" 
"What?" I asked. 
"I mean, I don't know any of these people," he confessed. 
"Why are you here then?" 
He sounded ready for the question. "There are three reasons 


to come to parties like this," and he began 
to list them: "First, there's the dancing-
but I really don't feel like dancing because 
I feel a little stupid dancing in front of 
people I don't know. The second is the 
_ drinking, but I don't feel like drinking 
~ tonight. And third is to meet women-" 
~ 
"-to hook up, right?" I prodded. 
"Yeah, these parties are great if you 
r 
" 
Q) want to meet someone rast. 
I realized that he was not going to be 
·~ my connection. At this party there was 
~ nothing to connect to. I sought out the 
~ host and tried to pin him down. "How 
~many of these people do you actually 
~ know?" I demanded. 
He looked up to survey the room and 
then bent down to shout in my ear, 
"Maybe 15 percent." He looked around 
the room again and leaned down. 
"Maybe." 

M 
y trip to the Beach Club was a 
self-conscious attempt to locate 
the mainstream at Yale. Instead, 
I found that I had become disconnected 
from any central Yale social scene. For the 
past semester, the parties I had been going 
to were usually small gatherings of people 
who all knew each other. But what 
seemed co connect them was the sense 
that there was a larger, more homogenous 
group of "normal" Yalies that these parties 
were most defiantly not. 

A few nights after the Beach Club's 
Tequila Monday, I went to the release 
party for the Yale Literary Magazine, held 
at its designer's Park Street apartment. 
Everyone was reading the freshly printed 
magazines. I spotted the box of issues on 
the floor next to a table crowded with 
martini fixings and a jug of red wine. 
Wandering partygoers moved through the 
kitchen. People stayed only as long as 
they wanted, until they finished making 
their drinks or tired of the company. In 
the living room, the groupings were more 
permanent. Ashes grew long on the 
Dunhills of the people seated on the 
couches, chairs, and floors. Conversations 
drew on as one topic was exhausted and 
another began. It was poetic. 

Few introductions were necessary; 
invitations had been taped to the Yale 
Station mailboxes of people associated 
with the magazine. Most of the people 
had come to see their published work or 
that of their friends. There was no social 
tension because the crowd was self-
selected. The only challenge of coming to 
an event like this was to set myself apart 
in a room full of people so much like 
myself. Even so, the only way to be sure 
of my own individuality was to ground it 
in the common understanding of the 
people around me. Being with people that 
were like me was comfortable, but it 
struck me that this scene was a bit 
ridiculous. This is not what· mainstream 
Yale does for fun. The rest of Yale was out 
there, I thought, but if I was going to 
find it, I would have to go beyond these 
apartment walls. 

ass media images of college life 
tell me that the mainstream 
flows down frat row. On 
television and in movies, the most often 
depicted and recognized image of a 
college student is a kid in a sweatshirt 
bearing Greek letters. 
I 
haven't 
encountered that kid at Yale, yet. But I 
thought maybe there was truth to the 
stereotype, and I should venture out to 
Lake Place. 

The Sigma Nu Black Light Party was 
not my first opportunity, but it was the 
first time I mustered the nerve to accept a 
public invitation to a party thrown by a

bunch of fraternity brothers I didn't 
know. I felt I could go only after I had 
convinced two friends, Steve and Aaron, 
to come along. Although they do not 
frequent frat· parties, they had a history 
with Yale fraternities. They once 
infiltrated a rush event at Dakota J's by 
dressing in baseball caps and flannel 
shirts. Inside they ate free wings and 
drank free p itchers until they were 
suspected as impostors, at which point 
they quickly left the restaurant. Even in 
this fearless company, I had to drink a 
couple of shots of gin to bolster my 
courage before I left my room. 

Steve, Aaron, and I paid our $3 at the 
door and a younger frat brother drew a 
circle and a dot on the backs of each of 
our hands with a yellow highlighter 
marker. The marks bewildered us. We 
joked that the symbols might be secret 
code for the rest of the brothers: 
"Outsiders-kill on sight." 

Another brother pointed us down the 
stairs towards the basement. "You don't 
FEBRUARY 14, 1997 
know what's down there," he said. I took 
the comment as a warning. 

To match the black light theme of the 
party, Jimi Hendrix's "Purple Haze" and 
other late-1960s psychedelic hits were 
piped into the basement. At first I could 
only make out the silhouettes of people in 
the unnatural light. Suddenly, h uge, 
glowing block letters jumped out of the 
darkness: "FOOTBALL." As my eyes 
adjusted, I saw the equally large guy who 
wore these letters on the back of h is 
jacket. 

The black lights obscured the faces I 
passed in the crowd. Skin was dark 
purple; the whites of the eyes and teeth 
shone a pearly yellow. If I did know 
someone there, I would not have been 
able to recognize him or her. I saw a 
white baseball cap on nearly every male 
head, usually turned backwards. Along 
with cheap beer, the bar served live 
goldfish to be gulped from shot glasses. 
The bartender boasted that he had already 
swallowed eight. 

Steve, Aaron, and I formed a little ~ 
cluster in the middle of the crowd. I~ 
scanned faces for someone I knew, but~ 
this time people were already too~ 
engrossed in each other even to notice us. ~ 
We had no idea what was going o n .~· 
Mostly, we talked amongst ourselves and ~ 
admired our plastic cups that glowed a ~ 
bright orange. 

~ 
The stereotypes I exp ected were g 
confirmed. These markers-the hats, the ~ 
jackets, the goldfish-were a language I -
didn't understand, cues to one another as 
to whether the individuals at the party 
actually belonged. And, in our inability to 
communicate, it was obvious that we did 
not. 

Ignored by the rest of the party for 45 
minutes, the three of us decided it was 
time to leave. On the way out, I asked 
one of the brothers if this party was 
smaller than normal. He told me no. I 
asked him if he thought most undergrads 
came to these parties. He told me no. I 
then asked him where he thought the rest

he Internet may be the best thing that has happened to 
help spread the word of white power. In the past few 
years, white supremacists have emerged in force on the 
Internet, establishing a nerwork of hundreds of World 
Wide Web pages; they know the net provides a cheap and 
effective means to promote their messages. In the past, such 
groups existed on the margins of society, recruiting new members 
by pamphleting car windshields in mall parking lots. Today, they 
can design slick, hi-tech home pages at low cost and broadcast 
rheir message to a potential audience of 30 million Internet users. 
Human rights organizations that protest neo-Nazi hate and 
violence clash with civil libertarians over issues of censorship 
and the First Amendment. Responding to the on-going debate, 
many neo-Nazi web sires now feature disclaimers that users must 
read before they can reach rhe conrenr of the sires. Before 
entering the New Jersey Skinheads page, users are cautioned: 
Warning! This page may be offensive to haters of free speech

logged on to the IRC server, joined #nazi 
and waited as my screen went dark. 
Compared to the bright city-lights feel 
of the World Wide Web, the IRC is like 
sitting in an unlit room and conjuring 
disembodied spirits, hearing only voices in 
the dark but seeing nothing. The topic of 
conversation that evening was "Adolf 
Hitler was RJGHT!" I waited a few seconds. 
Then a flurry of white pixels appeared on 
my screen. 
<Skinhead> So, Jay, a Yale man eh? 
I was surprised he could tell where I 
was logging from. I typed a message back. 
<JOY> Yes. What about yourself, 
Skinhead? 
Mentioning Yale caught someone else's 
attention. 
<Bruderhof> Who goes to Yale? 
<Jay> I do.

<Jay> No. I'm just curious. 
<Bruderhof> Yale had no White Power 
when I was there. 
<Jay> B: you were at Yale? 
<Bruderhof> Jay: I went there for 1/2 
semester ... 
<Skinhead> is Yale a pretty liberal 
school? 
<Bruderhof> At New Haven Hospital. 
Yale SUCKS! Its even worse than 
harvard! 


<Skinhead> true 
<Jay> In some ways, yeah, it's very 
liberal.

<Jay> Bruderhof: what wp groups do you

<Bruderhof> Jay: no comment there, 
none 
<Skinhead> are you proud of your 
european heritage? 
<Jay> Skinhead: why do you assume my 
heritage is European? 
<Skinhead> natural assumption i guess. 
can't see non-Whites getting into 
yale without affirmative action. 
and I would imagine they are still 
a minority there 
<JOY> I don't know ... there are a 
lot of non-Whites at Yale. 
Something like 35%. 
<Skinhead> damn 
<Bruderhof> Nigger at yale=aa! 
<Bruderhof> niggers can get in med

<Jay> Yale does have affirmative

<Bruderhof> Lots of gooks at Yale

smart 
<Lyncher> Ed-U-Kated Nigger 
<Skinhead> so they can only use it to 
advance "their communities". at the 
expense of ours. when will it end? 
T
he next day, I went on the chat 
group again. The discussion topic 
was "If A Nigger Hangs From A 
Tree And Nobody's There To Hear It 
Does It Make A Sound?" Many of the 
same people were there, including 
Skinhead. 
<Jay> So Skinhead, do, you think the 
white race is in danger? 
<Skinhead> yes don't you? 
<Delia> The white is never in danger. 
They just get complacent at times. 
We are still the pure breed. 
<Jay> Well, there is more 
intermarriage going on now than 
ever before. 
<Skinhead> this is not true Delia: we 
are facing extinction 
<Delia> The race traitors must witer. 
<Delia> wither 
<Delia> Sorry Skin. 
<JOY> Do you think the threat of 
extinction comes from the 
government or from other races? 
<Skinhead> government mostly 
<JOY> So you mean like government 
programs to aid minorities? 
<Skinhead> the u.s. government is our 
biggest enemy 
<Delio> They shroud the Block and the 
mongrels in protection.

etc. 
<Jay> You mean prevent us from arming 
ourselves? 
<Skinhead> no 
<Delio> The whitemon needs more guns. 
<Skinhead> how about militarily AND 
econimicolly? ie S. Africa 
<Jay> So the government should be 
giving more money to white 
countries and less to third world 
countries? 
<Skinhead> well I say no foreign aid 
at all, period 
<Delio> We give billions to the Jew. 
Israel. 
<Jay> Do you think interrqciol 
marriage is a threat too? 
<Delio> Interracial marriage is a 
detriment, however it may also 
purge our kind of bod genetics. 
<Skinhead> in a way, but even though a 
minority mix, their friends, and 
associates usually toke the side of 
the minority and thus eventual 
racial suicide 
<Jay> How do you think we should go 
about fighting? 
<Skinhead> any means necessary 
<Jay> would you ever consider using 
violence? 
<Skinhead> yes. I feel violence is 
being commited on my race doily, 
it's self defence 
<Joy> You mean like drive-by 
shootings, and so on? 
<Delia> The block kills its own. 
<Skinhead> no, like block on white 
crime, and forced integration 
<Delio> Remember Whitey! The Block and 
the Jew ore using you! (Not 
neccessarily in that order!) 
<Jay> Do you think if we segregate, 
things would be better, or do you 
wont to eliminate other races 
fEBRUARY 14, I997 
entirely? 
<Skinhead> and all the while, the 
endless vilification of the White 
race Jay. segregation won't work, 
we must SEPARATE by continents 
<Jay> So N. America would be for 
whites, and African-Americans would 
go bock to Africa? 
<Skinhead> africa for black, asia for 
yellow, s. america for brown europe 
for White, America. I would like 
America for White but it almost 
seems unreal at this point. 
<Jay> Because it's already so diverse? 
<Delio> I blame the Jew for 
influencing our entertainment 
industry. 
<Jay> Do you think that will ever 
happen? Separation by continents? 
<Skinhead> that's the way it started, 
why not? I mean, not many whites in 
asia or africa, but lots of them in 
our countries 
<Delia> The block insists on not using 
birth control. Its like rats 
breeding. 
<Jay> Well, for one thing, the 
worldwide racial diversity we're 
seeing now is the result of 
centuries of immigration. 
<Skinhead> I can't believe that we ore 
around 10% of the world's 
population and we let them in our 
countries! that's suicide! 
<Joy> Hove you ever read any Hitler? 
<Skinhead> Meim Kampf was a lightouse 
in a storm to me. 
I
was looking at the scene of an 
execution. In front of me were four 
men. Three were soldiers, jackbooted 
storm troopers with iron helmets. The 
regalia on their shoulders marked them as 
Third Reich Nazis, soldiers in Hitler's 
army. The brims of their helmets cast 
stark shadows in the bright sunlight, 
obscuring their faces. The fourth man was 
an elderly civilian with white whiskers and 
clad in plain clothes. The soldier on the 
left was smirking smugly and had a pistol 
pressed hard into the old man's throat. 
The old man was in pain. He might have 
been sobbing. Perhaps he was begging for 
his life. His muscles were tense. His whole 
body cringed. He was waiting to die. At 
the next moment, the Nazi officer was 
going to shoot him. 
Click. I scrolled down. The graphic of 
the Nazi soldiers carried a caption in 
white block letters: "coo SENT us." Below 
was the German phrase "Juden und 
Schwarze raus"-Jews and blacks get out. 
Further down was a statement: "It is 
simply fact that the White race faces 
certain extinction in the near future." 
This site was called Northern Thunder, a 
neo-Nazi page I found while looking for 
the International White Racialists page, 
the site Skinhead maintained. Something 
about the way he had talked made him 
sound more serious than the others. 
Skinhead's 
page 
was 
another 
technological marvel-text and graphics 
on a grey background decorated with 
engravings of Nazi flags and rows of 
soldiers, all embossed on grey to look as if 
they had been carved in a stone memorial. 
I felt like I had walked into a World War 
II museum in an altered world where the 
Nazis had won the war. An animation box 
flashed the words "WHITE REVOLUTION IS 
THE ONLY SOLUTION." I scrolled down tO a 
list of "POWs," men in prison for violent 
hate crimes. "Bruce Pierce-252 years, 
David Lane-190 years." I read on. Bruce 
Pierce and David Lane, I would later 
learn, were the two white supremacist


--- Page 30 ---

defendants convicted in the 1984 
Denver shooting death of Jewish radio 
host Alan Berg. The same David Lane 
who coined the 14 words. 
After more wanderings, I came across 
a Time magazine on-line feature called 
"Free Speech on the Internet," based on 
a TV segment from che NewsHour with 
Jim Lehrer. I clicked to download the 
ten-minute clip. A few seconds later, the 
crisp sound of a TV announcer's voice 
was streaming out of my computer. It 
alternated with the deeper tones of 
interview clips. "Daren Brittell is a self-
described racist. Which means I love my 
race and I'm willing to do whatever it 
takes to secure the Existence of my race. He 
has swastikas on his wall, Hider's Mein 
Kampf on his bookshelf, a shotgun by his 
30 
beef, and a message on his mind. My 
main message is to wake white people up to 
the genocide that is being taken place 
against our race right now. Through his 
computer, he also has a connection to 
the Internet. It's helping me get my 
message across, which is what I am on a 
mission to do. It's to spread the word of 
white survival as far as possible." 
The rhetoric in the news clip 
sounded uncomfortably familiar. The 
phrases Brittell used reminded me of my 
talk with Skinhead. Puzzled, I opened 
the transcript I had kept of the previous 
night's IRC chat. At times, people 
addressed Skinhead as "Daren." I 
noticed Skinhead's network address was 
~db@207.104.138.182. So Skinhead was 
Daren Brittell, an outspoken neo-Nazi, 
willing to publicly advocate violence, 
and an admirer of convicted murderer 
David Lane. I went back to the 
newsgroup, wondering whether I was in 
any danger. I resolved that it would be 
my last time. 
<Riley14> Jay do you know the 14 words 
<Skinhead> 14 words: we must secure 
the existence of our people and a 
future for White children. 
<Jay> Yes. I've been surfing the web. 
<Eric> the beloved 14 words 
<Eric> R U national socialist, Jay? 
<Jay> No, I'm not. Are you, Eric? 
<Eric> yes, i believe in the wisdom of 
the great leader 
<Jay> Eric: By great leader, do you 
mean Hitler?

IRC log ended Thu Oct 17 23:58 
With that, the movement on my 
screen abruptly stopped. I had been 
kicked off the chat group and banned 
from returning. I suddenly became 
aware that it was midnight and I was 
sitting alone in a dark computer lab. 
T
hree nights of chatting with real-
life neo-Nazis left me feeling 
sick. But surfing the web the next 
day, I understood why hate groups of all 
kinds have seized on the Internet as a 
primary method of advertising. 
Skinheads, white supremacists, neo-
Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, and those who 
deny the Holocaust all find a home on 
the Internet. Some pages, like the 
Nigger Joke Center, are merely sickening 
and offensive. Ochers are more serious, 
intended to persuade and recruit. It is 
impossible to know whether Eric would 
follow through on his violent threats, 
but we know that at least some of the 
denizens of these groups are for real. 
The White Aryan Resistance Hate Page, 
for instance, is maintained by Tom 
Metzger, a former Klansman who quit 
the KKK to found his own more extreme 
group, the White Aryan Resistance. 
Metzger was later found guilty of 
inciting murder, after three members of 
his group beat an Ethiopian student to 
death in Portland, Oregon. 
Many of the pages are infected with 
a bizarre paranoia about the impending 
"extinction" of white people. The Aryan 
Nation's page warns that at only 8 
percent of the world's population, the 
white "race," is in danger of genocide at 
the hands of "the Jew" -a curious 
reversal. 
Other 
pages 
explicitly 
denounce this culture of fear. Some try 
to conceal their racism, proclaiming chat 
they do not hate at all, but merely love 
their race and are willing to fight for it. 
The Adelaide Institute, for instance, 
runs a page that denies the Holocaust. 
"Why would 
anyone 
find 
this 
offensive?" the page demands. "We are 
celebrating the living who were thought 
dead." Another recurring theme is the 
metaphor of a great war, and a certain 
nostalgia for the days of the Third 
Reich. One page is named "Blur und 
Ehr," meaning "Blood and Honor"-che 
motto of the Nazi SS. 
Hate groups on the net have 
proliferated to the point where it is now 
possible to stumble across these sites 
without even looking for them. A search 
for the word "holocaust" on the search 
engine at Lycos yields a link to 
alt.revisionism-a discussion group 
devoted to denying the Holocaust. 
There 
is 
nothing 
to 
prevent 
schoolchildren from unwittingly coming 
across these sites. 


Many users agree that to fight 
Internet hate, we must meet it on its 
own terms, using its same technology to 
combat it by exposing its lies and 
rhetoric for what they are. It is in this 
spirit that a librarian at the Harvard Law 
Library created a site called Hatewatch 
(http : //www.hatewatch.org). 
Hatewatch's mission is to monitor hate 
groups, keeping live links to their Web 
pages. We can no more wipe out hate on 
the Internet than we can wipe out the 
human impulse to hate. But, with 
vigilance, we can show the users of the 
Internet why these hate groups are 
wrong.

we're waiting. I'll see you soon. I know you won't abandon us." 
Merritt hands the cellular phone back to the man who lent it 
to her. It is 2:30 a.m., early Saturday morning, Crown Street, New 
Haven. The line for last-minute orders stretches the length of 
Aladdin's single, fluorescendy-lit room. Cold and constant rain 
interrupts our view through the restaurant's sheetglass display 
window. Merritt stomps her patent-leather-booted heel 
Ci impatiently, checking first her watch and then the street outside. 
§ She tightens the wrap of her coat and walks into the street to wait 
~ for the car with Gadi, Tyler, Nick, and me. Five minutes elapse 
~ before it arrives. By the time everybody crams in-there are six of 
~ us in a car that seats five at best-it is nearly 3 a.m. We will not 
~ get to Foxwoods until 4 a.m. But there is no turning back. We 
~ have been crowing about our imminent trip all night, receiving 
8 gambling advice, and hearing Foxwoods tales from people who 
C) 
~ have been once, or who regularly make this pilgrimage. 
~ 
We press on, shedding exit after exit, insistent rain flying from 
l; the windshield. Conversation in the car establishes that Foxwoods 
~ is indeed the largest casino in the world, employer of 10,000 and 
&. home of 3, 100 slot machines and 234 tables. The Mashantucket 
Foxwoods Casino brings both dollars and 
destitution to Southern Connecticut. 

Pequots have been raking in vast sums of money since they built 
the casino in 1992: estimates range fro·m $400 rrullion to $1 
billion annually. The Pequots give up $ 100 million a year to keep 
the state coffers full, and maintain the reservation's monopoly on 
gambling. We pass New London, Groton, Mystic, and turn off the 
interstate. 

I remember the last time I took this road to Ledyard. I was on 
a bus on my way to Providence. It was March, late at night, a 
blizzard. Every seat on the Greyhound was claimed. Plastic bags 
full of food and liters of Coke cluttered the aisle. I dosed my eyes 
and listened to the two sweatsuited, middle-aged women across 
from me complaining about their husbands and their bad luck at 
tb.e slots. I tried for a while to follow the loudly-voiced free 
associations of a deranged man a few rows behind me. I fell asleep. 
When I woke, it was to bright light and a woman's voice 
coming through a megaphone. "You are now at portal six. A bus 
will be here to meet you at 7:00 a.m. Please pick up a map as you 
exit the bus. Welcome to Foxwoods. Good luck." The bus drained 
of all but two or three passengers. As we pulled away, out of the 
parking lot and back towards the highway, I began to grasp the 
sheer size of the place. Snow accumulating on the ground reflected 
the pinks and purples of the light murals on the building's flank. 
Massive sculptures were stained a ·garish, otherworldly hue. 
}J
proaching Foxwoods, this time aware that it is my 
destination, I still can't quite believe my eyes. "It goes on 
or miles," says a voice from the backseat. Even from this 
distance-stili on the road, the complex far away-1 can't discern 

the casino's perimeters. 

The first thing we do when we pass through the glass door 
and ascend the wide flight of stairs is stop at the cash machine. It 
spits out $100 bills. A man with a walkie-talkie and a green suit 
checks our IDs and gives us each a map. The six of us in all-black 
regalia move past him into the casino. There does not seem to be 
a norm here; no one even looks twice at our boots and boas and 
leather jackets. I have nothing with which co compare the space. 
All my metaphors fail me: a carnival factory? a petri dish of 
turquoise and chrome? Liberace's ear wax? 

A guard accompanies me across the carpeted floor to the 
coatcheck because the umbrella I carry is considered a weapon. 
She notices the dismay that settles on my face as we move deeper 
into the atrium, a stand of shivering, bleeping slot machines on 
our right, a field of blackjack and roulette tables on the left. We 
walk by a stretch of teller windows, where chips convert to money 
and cups filled with quarters are exchanged for bills. 
"This is slow for this time on a Friday night," she says. 
"There are usually more people here than this?" I ask. It's not 
what I'd call overcrowded. There are some unused slots, but most 
of the tables in this first room are occupied, and it's now 4:30 
a.m. 
"Oh, yeah. This is nothing." The guard makes a gesture, as if 
to conjure under her forearm's sweep a room teeming with 
gamblers. 
"How many people do you think can fir in here?" 
She looks at me wide-eyed, like I have asked how many atoms 
can fir on the head of a pin, or if she thinks the earth could just 
FEBRUARY !4· 1997 
be a speck of dust under a giant's fingernail. 
"I have no idea ... there's no way to tell." 

G 
adi walks away from the roulette table. I walk with Nick 
and him into the slot parlor. I feel like I have entered a 
Super Mario hell: the nonsensical inflection of beeping 
and the lights that flare without a stimulus. Gadi and Nick 
comment on the scene before them. 
"It's the irony of all the ringing bells and all the really sad 
people." 
"The worrying machinery ... " 
I recognize a couple sitting in here, side by side at the slots. 
The man wears grey camouflage pants and a purple sweatshirt, his 
belly a visible band of flesh. The woman's hair is tangled, long, 
unkempt. I saw her earlier, trailing behind him through the 
lobby. He looked angry. "You'll win it back, honey," she whined. 
They look meaner than before. We leave the slot parlor and walk 
down a wide empty hallway. 
"You could write a whole story about the Native American 
tragedy that's taking place right here," Gadi says. 
"Any Native Americans in sight?" Nick asks. "Not a one."

waist. On the benches circling his glade, 
old men sleep and women read; one 
mother rocks a stroller absently. The 
Indians at Foxwoods are massive, 
unidentified, prelinguistic, prehistoric. 
There are no statues of the white 
man; instead there are animatronic 
robots. They emerge from casement 
windows above the storefront facades 
that line the casino's maze of hallways. 
Captain John and the tavern mistress 
Abby show off their plastic musculature 
as they tell anecdotes to passersby. They 
talk about their histories, romances, 
families, morals, jobs. If you listen long 
enough, their tapes repeat. 

Not one of us wins money that 
night. We leave at 7 a.m. Outside it is 
dawn, and the rain has thinned to a cold 
gray nag. Misery. 

Vanessa Gezari (SY '97) grew up 
in 
the 
idyllic 
town 
of 
Stonington, about ten miles from 
Ledyard. It is a quiet place, a small 
fishing 
village 
turned 
Defense 
Department factory outlet, turned 
depressed victim of military budget cuts. 
Its charm did not disappear with the 
U.S. Navy, however, and the affluent 
residents of Stonington Village and the 
city folk who summer there still find it a 
pleasant place. Stonington considers 
itself just a little more sophisticated than 
its rural neighbor Ledyard, where the 
houses are spaced at three-mile intervals, 
and the only site worth seeing is the new 
casino on the Pequot reservation. 

The people of Stonington feel the 
presence of Foxwoods, looming on 
Ledyard's thin, rocky soil. They have 
witnessed demographic change; the lure 
of employment brings families from as 
far as Las Vegas. Its jobs also pull locals 
up from destitution. Foxwoods has 
proved to be a stopper in the economic 
leak that threatens the area. It employs 
the laid-off workers from the closing 
factories, the struggling carpenters, the 
odd-jobs men who can't find work. 

Demographic change breeds tension. 
The introduction of unknown elements 
causes hairs to bristle on the backs of 
local necks. A mounting flurry of small 
crimes has brought discomfort. Last 
summer, Stonington witnessed its first 
murder in eight years. Change comes 
from all directions: the flotsam of the 
casino circuit, the out-of-state and out-
of-town gamblers, an Indian population 
whose affluence and influence rises 
exponentially. 

Vanessa sees the casino as both the 
cause of and the solution to the tension. 
"The kind of frictions that are going to 
develop are the kind that are going to 
develop anywhere when you have a poor 
or lower-middle-class, working, blue-
collar community that is not able to 
raise itself above a certain level, and then 
you have people who are fabulously 
wealthy. On the other hand, Foxwoods 
has a weird way of gelling all of that 
friction because of the thrill of the 
casino. It has to do with winning 
money." 

"The possibility of instant mobility," 
I offer. 

"Even when you lose, you feel like 
you had a chance at least. It seems to 
smooth over the very frictions that 
would occur in this kind of a 
community. I mean there is racism, but 
there is racism everywhere." 

The Indians, she says, are a familiar 
presence. Their names mark the land. It 
is the local reaction to the presence of 
other racial groups, those using 
Foxwoods, 
that emphasizes how 
provincial this part of the state is. The 
Indians, for the time being, are treated 
with a grudging respect. I ask if Indians 
are the butt of wisecracks. 

"Right now there is a sort of awe, 
and almost a kind of 'good ol' boys' 
feeling about them. The area is 
predominantly white, and even the 
people who are white and middle to 
lower class feel like this is the Indians 
making good, and they sort of feel like 
they're just slapping them on the back. 
It's the kind of thing where it's like, 
'Yeah, those guys don't have anything to 
worry about,' which could turn very 
easily into, 'They don't have anything to 
worry about, let's go give them 
something to worry about.'" 

The casino benefits its employees: 
the pay is decent and the working 
conditions are good. The members of 
the Pequot tribe who take a cut of 
Foxwoods' astronomical proceeds are 
getting a taste of the good life. It is the 
gamblers who are losing money by the 
busload. Vanessa tells a story that has 
the ring of everyday truth, a dreary fact 
of life in a casino town. 

"A friend of a friend was waiting in 
line for the movies in Niantic behind 
this couple. Niantic has a good theater, 
it plays artsy movies. The movies are 
$3.50. The man turned to the woman 
and said, 'You know what, I don't think 
we can afford this. I think I lost too 
much 
money at 
Foxwoods this 
weekend.' And the couple just left. 
That's $7.00." 

Such exchanges promise to become 
quotidian. It already sounds almost like 
an eerie admonition, a dull fairy tale 
FEBRUARY 14, 1997 
whose moral is implicit in its brief plot. 
Foxwoods' new rival, the Mohegan Sun, 
opened this October in Uncasville, 
Connecticut, just a stone's throw from 
Ledyard. Foxwoods itself already has an 
expansion project underway, to be 
completed by the end of 1997, that will 
add 900 hotel rooms to the existing 500, 
as well as more gaming space. The 
Mashantucket Pequots also plan to open 
a summer theme park. Seasonal tourists 
and a migrant labor force will glut and 
purge the area annually, injecting money 
and depleting resources. Vanessa thinks 
the theme park will upset the balance 
between the quiet seaside community 
and 
giddy 
entertainment 
megalopolis in its midst. 

"Foxwoods is still this thing that is 
really hidden away in the woods in 
Ledyard. It's very self-sustained right 
now. It's doing a good job-and I don't 
know if it will keep doing a good job-
but it's both employing a really large 
number of people and not doing a lot of 
damage ... it seems. Until we get some 
sort of seepage, which may happen with 
this increase in crime, if it is really 
connected. And what about theft? Not 
the bloody crime, but what about people 
getting their fix? I mean, are we going to 
start having Addicts Anonymous, 
Gamblers Anonymous...?" 

As Vanessa talks, thoughts of 
Foxwoods shift and rearrange in my 
head. Fragments of the overheard and 
the surreptitiously seen collect. I picture 
myself standing by the casino doors, 
watching two very overweight men in 
gold and hightops creating banter for 
the sake of the thin woman who 
accompanies them. She looks on, 
amused, as one man says to the other, 
"You're a junkie, man. You're addicted. 
Take a slot machine and stick it in your 
arm." He jabs his forefinger into his own 
arm like a syringe. The accused shakes 
his head and protests that he didn't 
come at all last week. The first man 
points to a dispenser of flyers advertising 
the gambling addiction hotline. "You 
need that number, man?" 


**Yale Style**
**Author: Unattributed**
**Page number(s): 36**

"I 
remember when Yale students actually wore the 
clothes sold in J. Press," says my grandmother when 
we walk through New Haven, her old hometown. 
"Goodness, how times have changed." 

As my grandmother has noticed, J. Press is usually empty. The 
high-priced stores lining Chapel Street are equally devoid of 
customers. I have yet to see one of J. Press's $50 Yale scarves on 
an actual student. And I, for one, am afraid to even touch one of 
Ann Taylor's suits, much less purchase one. 

It seems I am not alone; most of the outfits I see on campus 
are obvious attempts to satisfy the need for casual comfort. The 
only trend that seems to have been a hit with Yale students is the 
grunge look. Women without make-up and men in sweats seem 
to be less the exception than the rule. But I'm hesitant to describe 
what Yalies consider campus chic since ours seems to be a 
singularly Yale style. What makes such a geographically diverse 
group as Yale's student body come to dress in the same form of 
non-style? 

New Haven's frigid winters are one explanation. It's not that 
my Yale friends and I don't care about looking good, it's just that 
we care more about being warm. Wearing an above-the-knee skirt 
in below-freezing temperatures is not comfortable. While both 
my homecoming and prom dresses saw the light of day last year, 
for this year's winter ball I donned a pair of faded blue corduroys 
and my duck boots. If walking up the ice slicks we call sidewalks 
doesn't inspire Yale women to put away their high heels in favor 
of ungainly, but remarkably steady, winter boots, I don't know 
what will. 

But weather alone can't explain why personal grooming seems 
so different here from the rest of the world. People at similarly 
frigid schools have very different experiences with the world of 
college fashion. According to a friend at Boston University, Yalies 
are mere fashion amateurs. In Boston, nothing gets in the way of 
style, which, incidentally, is a concept very different from the 
utilitarian parkas and boots of Yale. Leather jackets are de rigueur 
for men-no down coats there-and women wear body-
conscious styles even in the dead of winter. My friend attributes 
this to the international students who come to Boston, bringing 
European high fashion and the money to back it up. Her 
description was verified by a friend at Columbia, where even the 
grime of a New York winter can't keep the fashion mavens down. 

So if weather isn't affecting our neighbors to the North and 
South, it can't be the only reason Yalies seem to have lost their 
fashion know-how. Our sense of style, it would appear, relates to 
our sense of self. 

The importance (or non-importance) of appearance in the 18 
years that precede matriculation at college makes an imprint. It 
seems the study habits students bring to Yale offer reason for our 
fashion anemia. Eighteen straight hours of studying somehow 
make fashion less of a priority. The sweatpants and matted hair

The look that takes over during exam period is just an extension of 
Yale's normal fashion sense. Students who choose Yale tend to 
take responsibility, regarding school and everything else, seriously. 
If my shopping habits are any indication, there's a link between 
being a conscientious student and being a conscientious spender. 
I can't imagine dropping hundreds of dollars to replace 
serviceable clothes any better than I can think of blowing off a 
final exam. 
But following that logic, a Yalie should look no different from 
any student at Harvard or Princeton. As any red-blooded Yalie 
knows, nothing could be further from the truth. People at 
Harvard seem to dress according to what they do: lit majors dress 
wear black and econ majors look like they're ready to take over 
the corner office at J. P. Morgan. The emphasis on appearance 
seems to be similar to the feeling we get that Cantabs care more 
about US. News and World Report rankings than we do. Similarly, 
a stroll around the Princeton campus feels like an adventure into 
a J. Crew catalog. But for YaJies, clothing seems to be less a 
uniform and more a way to look presentable while we're doing 
what we think is really important. We are passionate about what 
we are doing not because we think there's some type we need to 
fit, but because we are genuinely interested. 
And while for most Yalies this passion for their activities 
becomes a reason to neglect fashion, for a few among our student 
body, clothing is their passion. When fashion takes over it really 
fEBRUARY 14, 1997 
takes over, as it does for Hai-Ting Chinn (MUS '97). You've 
probably seen her walking around in her top hat, decked out in 
an outfit resembling that of an eighteenth-century boy. As she 
says, "The way I dress reflects my lifestyle. I want to live a life 
that's not part of this century." Her sister in spirit is Francesca 
Mymen (TO '98), who wears hand-sewn medievel garb. 
"Whenever we see each other, we have this feeling of complicity," 
Chinn says. 
Another woman who's often noticed for her unique sartorial 
tastes is Michelle Benitez (SY '00). She adheres to the Afro-
Carribbean religion Santeria, which requires initiates to dress in 
all-white for one year. For Benitez., attire reflects her most closely 
held beliefs. In their own way, these exceptions fit Yale's unique 
fashion rules: here, there are no rules.

On file: copulating cartoon characters, 
Eurosmut, porno flick plot synopses. 
by Alex Funk 
I
t will probably be February 14. The pastel candies 
will be ceasing you mercilessly. "BE MINE," 
they'll beg sarcastically. "''M YOURS," they'll lie. 
You'll bitterly mash the tiny hearts in your mouth, 
ironically underscoring their message. 
You'll be tasting broken heart. 
You'll swallow these candies, considering various 
Yale methods of beating the Valentine blues, only 
slightly aware of the self-destruction implicit in the 
act. 
And then it will come to you, a call from 
another world. Like Costner in a cornfield, you will 
hear the call. 
"Zeta ... " 
It may be a while before you follow the voice, but eventually you 
will. Your blues will disappear iri.to the grey New Haven air. The 
healing power of Zeta lies on the shelves of Yale's library system; and 
you don't have to read well to enjoy it. 
You'll find your way to Seeley Mudd Library, home of Yale's Zeta 
Collection of non-circulating material. When you enter an Orbis 
keyword search for "Zeta and Mudd," you'll retrieve 2,289 entries. 
T he entries will at first seem arbitrary, ranging from Bocaccio's 
Decameron to a book of The New l'Orker cartoons, but before long 
you will sort through such chaff to get to the wheat. And wheat you 
will find ... 
You'll secure an informative copy of The X-Rated Videotape Guide 
IV by Robert Rimmer and Patrick Riley. You'll assume the first 
author to be working under a pseudonym, the second ro be 
moonlighting as coach of the Miami Heat. Call number: ZETA PN 
1995.9 S45 R563X. 
You'll brush up your Spanish by reading Solo Para Adultos: 
Historia del Cine X, an informative tome by Casto Escopico replete 
with "plot" synopses of your favorite porno flicks, as well as 
memorable stills from hits like Deep Throat and Behind the Green 
Door. On page 262 you will find a photograph of John Holmes' 
legendary 15-inch penis. Call number: ZETA PN1995.9 S45 E73. 
You'll recoil in fascinated terror as you glance at juliette De Sade, 
a French cartoon book that features hand-drawn portrayals of 
apocalyptically violent sex. Call number: ZETA PQ 2663 A889 + J9. 
Quickly, you will move on to a different book of French erotic 
pop art, Les Chefi-D'Oeuvre de Ia Bantle Dessinle Erotique, the fifth 
volume of which contains Spiderman with female genitalia, Goofy 
getting laid, "Little Orgasm Annie," and Mickey Mouse doing 
something truly unmentionable to a rather young-
looking pink elephant. Call number: ZETA PN 
6714 + C46. 
Soon, you will regret the fact that these works 
are non-circulating. You'll ask librarians about the 
Zeta Collection, and their answers will strike you as 
disturbingly vague. "It has a quirky character," one 
tell you, and that the collection's purpose is "to 
control material likely to be stolen or damaged." 
hough not entirely satisfied, you'll reluctantly 
acknowledge chat you'd be more inclined to steal 
Exquisite Creatures than Paradise Lost. 
In the 1930s and 1940s, the Zeta Collection 
contained birch control literature that the state of Connecticut 
prohibited from being openly displayed. Back then, the collection 
was housed in a two-story locked cage on the seventh floor of 
Sterling Memorial Library. T he librarian says he "knows the Zeta 
Collection very personally," which you will interpret as some kind of 
joke. Strangely, none of the employees of the Yale Library System 
will be able to tell you when or by whom the Zeta Collection was 
started, or how it got its ominous name. 
Your appetite for smut whetted, you will explore other 
collections of Yale pornography, only to find them pale in 
comparison to the mystical Zeta. You won't deign to investigate 
Sterling's collection of Playbqy magazines, as they're chiefly stored on 
microform, the ultimate anti-erotic medium. You'll consider 
researching Beinecke's collection of Playboys until you notice the 
Orbis caveat "many issues mutilated and/or stained." You will look at 
Mother Yale looming majestically over the circulation desk, and you 
will wonder what she looks like nude. 
So you'll follow the voice back to Mudd and the welcoming 
embrace of Zeta. Soon, the librarians won't need to ask which books 
you're requesting. Soon, you'll hear the images on the pages cooing 
"BE MINE," "KISS ME," and other things not found on Valentine 
candy. You'll have overcome your loneliness, become a Romantic 
scholar; with a straight face, you'll tell your parents that your love life 
is great and you've been spending a lot of time in the library. The 
months will float by like a breeze. · 
And some bleak day, probably in a future February, you'll see a 
downtrodden student walking up Science Hill, angrily chomping on 
some kind of candy. And you'll know what to do: drift up behind 
him, lips by his ear, and pass on the voice: 
"Zeta ... " you'll whisper. The call number of the wild.
