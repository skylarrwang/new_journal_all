EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Friday, August 28: 
It's the first 
evening of production weekend for the 
magazine, and the executive board just 
finished brainstorming cover ideas 
over a bad mushroom pizza. Having 
chosen the architecture piece for the 
cover, 
we debated 
different sug-
gestions, 
considering and 
then 
abandoning a collage of photos. We 
decided to combine drawings of the 
bandshell with one large picture and 
then turned to the color. "I was 
thinking of a blue background, with 
the lines of the drawing screened in a 
lighter shade." "H ow about a dark 
blue, with the lines in white to suggest 
blueprints?" We'll reconvene tomorrow 
morning to choo$e a photo and a shade 
of blue. Now, one writer is trying to 
come up with a headline for the Mid-
wives piece: "I want nurturing, I want 
hugs." Another is scratching out a 
correction he just made in the copy. 
"I'm illiterate," he explained. 

This is 
the 
final stage of the 
magazine's 
production, 
a 
process 
which began four months ago, was 
carried for the summer to New York, 
Washington, and California, and re-
turned to New H aven in the middle of 
August. It culminates in a week, when 
we distribute 11,000 copies throughout 
the campus. Then it all starts over 
again. 

We're 
The 
New Journal, 
an 
undergraduate magazine covering 
Yale and New H aven. We publish six 
times during the school year, each 
issue presenting the same format: 
feature stories, including news stories 
and profiles; Between the Vines, a 
section devoted to thoughtful opinion 
pieces; the Afterthought, an essay 
written by an expert in a field of 
interest to the Yale community; book 
reviews; letters; and the Newsjournal, 
in which we offer short news items and 
update past features. The New Journal is 
completely advertiser-supported and 
student-run, with a Board of Directors 
drawn from New Haven and Yale. 

In the past five years, four of our 
features have won Yale nonfiction 
writing prizes. The New Republic ran a 
condensed version of a 
New Journal 
cover story on Accuracy in Academia. 
CBS turned a cover story on a New 
H aven prostitute with AIDS into a 
segment for 60 Minutes; the same story 
won a Rolling Stone College Journalism 
award for investigative reporting. And 
for three years in a row, The New 
Journal has won top honors from the 
Columbia University 
Press 
Association. 

We welcome your responses to our 
stories. Please write and let us know 
what you liked, what you didn't like, 
and what you'd like to add. And we'd 
love to have your help. The New Journal 
is looking for writers, photographers, 
designers and salespeople. We have 
planned an organizational meeting for 
Wednesday, September 9, in the Silli-
man common room, and we hope to 
see you there. 

Enjoy the issue, and look for us in 
October.
