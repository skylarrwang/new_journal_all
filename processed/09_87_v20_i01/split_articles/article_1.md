It's three in the morning, and you've just got to have twenty dollars. But, no 
matter how much you shake him, your roommate just won't wake up. Twenty 
dollars at three in the morning, with an opportunity of a lifetime staring you in the 
face. Who do you turn to? Quick Draw 24, of course. 

New Haven Savings Bank's automated teller is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a 
year. And it's right across the green from the campus. In minutes you can have 
your cash and the time of your life. You don't have a Quick Draw 24 card? Pity. 
They're so easy to get. Just stop in and complete an application at 195 
Church Street. Do it today, because opportunity rarely knocks twice.
