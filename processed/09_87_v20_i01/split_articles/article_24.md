An Informed Assemblage 
"What does it mean to be inter-
disciplinary?" I asked myself as I 
packed up my papers to come to Yale 
for the spring term of 1987. The 
director and fellows of the Whitney 
Humanities Center had invited me to 
be this year's Henry Luce Visiting 
Scholar in the Humanities and Social 
Thought, and I was looking forward to 
a setting where my colleagues would 
come from several fields. I was not 
disappointed. The professors grouped 
round the table in discussion every 
Friday were indeed diverse: from 
history, my own familiar field; from 
art history and the various literature 
departments; from philosophy, reli-
gion and political science; from the law 
school and even microbiology. In an 
essay published in 1980, Geoffrey 
Hartman had regretted that there was 
"barely any contact" between history 
and English. Clearly the situation has 
changed at Yale in these last years, and 
the Whitney Humanities Center has 
cut down on isolation. 

But what kinds of things are we 
saying to each other? What is involved 
when we borrow from or expand into 
another field? There are several 
possibilities. We can use each other's 
studies for our own purposes: in my 
current research on gifts and bribes in 
sixteenth-century France, I have been 
scavenging the art-historical publi-
cations for the iconography of the 
Three Graces, while Thomas Greene, 
in his work on poetry as a form of 
magic, has been reading historical 
publications on peasant spells and 
incantations. We can take as the center 
of our analysis texts or objects usually 
thought to "belong" to another field: 
John Michael Montias has used the 
artistic production of seventeenth-
century Delft as the data for an 
important book in economic history. 
And we can appropriate each other's 
models for explanation and inter-
pretation: Peter Brooks' Reading for the 
Plot uses Freud's theory of psychic 
processes in persons to renew our 
understanding of the narrative

movement of texts. 

The cross-disciplinary harvest has 
been abundant; it seemed to me a good 
moment to speculate on its signi-
ficance. Is the exchange between fields 
an indication of boredom or bank-
ruptcy within individual disciplines? 
Or is this a way that fields have often 
been nourished over the historical 
past? Is it part of a larger seismic 
disturbance with deeper causes, 
leading to "blurred genres" (to use 
Clifford Geertz's phrase) all over the 
sciences? What are the dangers in the 
process? Its rightful limits? Some 
fifteen years ago Rosalie Colie pointed 
out in The Resources of Kind that if we 
want the . delight and discovery of 
mixing our genres, we must have some . 
idea of genre rules to begin with. 

What better place than the Whitney 
Humanities Center for thinking about 
such questions? So I decided · to give 
my monthly Faculty Seminar the· title 
of "Shared Texts," by which I meant 
texts that no one field could rightly call 
its own "property." (They may not be 
the property of a single field, someone 
commented at the first session, but 
how much are they actually "shared," 
that is, read by different kinds of 
people? Our evenings often provided a 
first joint reading.) The notion was to 
see what wo\. 'rl happen when persons 
from different disciplines approached 
such texts- not merely what would 
happen to our understanding of their 
content and form, but what would 
happen to us as a group, to the nature 
of our debate. I chose texts that I had 
written on, but where I knew there 
could be a strongly opposed inter-
pretation, 
and 
I 
invited a 
co-
respondent from another field to lead 
off the discussion with me. 

The first text was an essay by 
Montaigne, "On the Affection of •:
Fathers for their Children" (Essays, 
Book II, chap.8). It asserts and then 
questions the power of parental 
affection, noting that fathers withhold 
needed property from their sons and 
that authors love the children of their 
brain more than the children of their 
bodies. Around '!his slippery text 
historians and literary specialists found 
some agreement. Not that we all 
thought that "De !'affection" meant the 
same thing. But it seemed that the 
effort of the historian (in this case, 
NZD) to draw upon lifetime property 
gifts and gift formulas to interpret the 
essay was the same kind of project as 
that of the critic-scholar (in this case, a 
Princeton colleague) who drew for his 
interpretation upon a death-bed gift 
from Montaigne's best friend. Did it 
make a difference that the death-bed 
gift was referred to smack in the 
middle of the essay, while the property 
gifts were scattered throughout? No 
one in the seminar said so, though the 
literary specialists were certainly not 
going to ignore the formal properties of 
the essay. Thomas Greene, my co-
respondent, made a 
compelling 
argument for a convergence of interest 
between historians and literary 
specialists in Renaissance studies, for a 
metatheory assisting our interpretation 
of diverse texts, rituals and events. 

The next session was marked by the 
same higher unity, though there was 
much quarreling about the quality of 
the "shared 
text." It 
was an , 
autobiography by Leon Modena, a 
Venetian rabbi of the early 
seventeenth century. (We read it in a 
new translation from the ·Hebrew, 
made by Mark Cohen of Princeton.) 
Celebrated for his preaching ahd

theological and literary publications, 
Modena revealed in his Life the secret 
agony of his gambling and his 
disappointment in his sons- one dying 
early from alchemical experiments, 
one slain by ghetto Jews before his 
eyes, and the third a wastrel and 
gambler like his father. Some seminar 
' ~ participants savored with me the 
interplay between Leon's sense of sin 
and suffering and his delight in his 
achievements, from two-year-old child 
prodigy on. Others found him a mere 
braggart, irritatingly deficient in self-
understanding. 

But the 
boundary · issue lay 
elsewhere: could a text composed 
within the conventions of Hebrew 
literature and aimed at a small circle of 
ghetto readers still be analysed 
terms of the questions one would 
writings of Montaigne or Ben-
venuto 
Cellini or the 
polymath 
Girolamo Cardano? Could Leon M o-
dena's Life be considered not only a 
Jewish autobiography but also an early 
modern European autobiography? 
Paula Hyman, my co-respondent and 
~pecialist in jewish studies, agreed that 
It could and more generally that Jewish 
social history and European social 
history could only benefit by an 
1' exchange and comparison of findings 
and of explanatory hypotheses. 
A 
discussion on the relation of gambling 
and writing was a good case in point. 

At the third session, all hell broke 
loose. 
The texts 
this 
time 
were 
sixteenth-century French 
letters of 
rem1ss1on, that is, the stories people 
told the king to get pardoned for a 
homicide they claimed was unin-
tentional, in self-defense or otherwise 
excusable. I had just finished a book 
called Fiction in the Archives, in which I 
argued that these narratives followed 
both the legal rules for what was 
pardonable and contemporary 
storytelling conventions about what 
was plausible, persuasive, funny or 
climactic. Though the letters were 
collectively authored by a notary and a 
supplicants, sometimes with advice. 
from an attorney, I tried to show that 
the supplicant's voice was the primary 
one and that· the narratives could be 
related not only to the prescriptions for 
pardon, b.ut also to the values and 
ordering principles of the person 
saving his or her neck by a story. 

Owen Fiss from the Law School re-
sponded that what was most 
interesting to him about the material 
was my aside on the Old Regime law 
of pardon for homicide; he affirmed 
that lawyers were very concerned 
nowadays about questions of nar-
rative, and that my letters of remission 
seemed to him simply the creation of 
sixteenth-century lawyers. Another 
colleague from the Law School agreed. 
Nothing I 
could say about the 
rhetorical tastes of sixteenth-century 
men of law or the limited role 
permitted them in pleading in criminal 
cases or the wide lay knowledge of 
pardon law would change their minds. 
Meanwhile, the literary people present 
took the letters of remission seriously 
as written texts: the stories in them 
were good enough to analyse in their 
own right. What difference did it make 
if a peasant's voice was "really" heard 
there or not? The little band of 
historians present exchanged glances 
and closed ranks, asserting, as did I, 
the importance of connecting social 
and cultural forms. 

Reading the letters of remission, we 
had each retreated within the borders 
of our discipline. Perhaps because of 
the novelty of the enterprise- pardon 
tales have rarely been studied as a 
genre- we each felt the need to assert 
first and foremost the central concerns 
of our field. Only armed with those 
certainties were we willing to consider 
exchange. It was a great evening, not 
the least of its fruits being O wen Fiss's 
arresting connection between discre-
tionary law and storytelling. 

The last seminar kept us still at 
creative odds. Here the "text" was a 
film, Day of Wrath, made in 1943 by the 
great Danish director Carl Dreyer. It 
was the story of punishment for witch-
craft, of accusation and self-accusation 
in a small Scandinavian town in the 
early seventeenth century. Instead of 
depicting magical practice as an orgy 
of witches' sabbath 
and demonic 
possession, it showed it in the circle of 
family- an old and weakening 
husband, a beautiful young second 
wife, a handsome son, a vindictive 
mother-in-law- and in the intimacy of 
everyday healing, harming, desire and 
jealousy. 

procla imed 
the 
film 
remarkably in tune with present day 
scholarship and maintained that Dryer's 
cinematic techniqt.ies-his play with 
blacks, whites and greys; his slow-
moving camera focussing on salient 
details like the wife's eyes- worked to 
deepen the ambiguities in the historical 
past. 

My co-respondent Brigitte 
Peucker saw 
it 
very 
differently. 
Speaking from her deep knowledge of 
theory 
and Ex pressionistic 
cinema, she presented Day of Wrath as a 
timeless account of a human predic-
ament and especially as an exploration 
of the magic of the camera's eye. 

The seminar participants reacted 
vigorously as individuals, not breaking 
along disciplinary lines; they disagreed 
with us and with each other about the
