themes and formal properties of the 
film. Here, even more than with letters 
of remission, I think the novelty of the 
enterprise was the key to our re-
sponses. Outside of film programs, the 
moving image is rarely the center of 
academic discourse: historians, for 
example, are only now working out a 
language to analyse how films tell 
about the past. How to borrow from 
another field when you don't know 
what the ingredients are in your own 
recipe? 

The closing hour came for that last 
session of "Shared Texts" with 
numerous people still clamoring to be 
heard. I take this aG a good sign. We 
had not realized Thomas Greene's 
vision of a common metatheory, and it 
was clear that exposing disciplinary 
criteria to each other brought as much 
vitality to our debates as startling leaps 
of connection. But I think we all went 
home with our bags fuller of tricks: 
Brigitte Peucker took a historical d~te 
had noted in one Dreyer image and 
used it to support her view of the film 
as timeless; I snatched her idea of the 
camera's magic and used it to support 
my view of the filmmaker as a sorcerer 
calling up the past. 

A 
worthy 
exchange.
