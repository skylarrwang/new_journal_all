**Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?**

It's 6:15 on Tuesday, September 15, 
you're waiting in line, and you're 
h u ngry. Slowly you shuffle forward. 
You take a tray and napkin. You take a 
knife, fork and spoon. You take a few 
m ore steps. And you come face to face 
with your first major decision since 
lunch: the cards above the steaming 
trays advertise Pasta Primavera, 
Shrimp Chow Mein, and Chicken Bas-
quaise. Chicken what? You're not sure 
you can pronounce it, and you know 
you've never seen it before. It looks 
red, 
stewing amid tomatoes, 
onions, and green peppers. Kind of 
interesting. The student worker, plate 
in one hand and ladle in the other, 
catches your eye. You look at the 
shrimp. You look at the pasta. You ask 
for the chicken. 

At least one student will not agonize 
over the choice. Sasha Grutman (BK 
'89) learned the recipe for a dish called 
"poulet basquaise" while attending 
C ordon Bleu culinary school in Paris 
the summer before last. When the 
Berkeley d ining hall representative 
a pproached 
him 
for 
recipes, 
he 
Chick en basquaise in th e rou gh. 
suggested poulet basquaise. 
And 
forgot all about it. "T his is the first I've 
heard of it," he said. "I'm really kind of 
shocked- I didn't think anyone would 
take it seriously." On Sept. 15, the 
Yale dining halls will offer chicken 
basquaise to 5000 people. 

Food is big business at Yale. It is a 
business in which Alan Kenney, d irec-
tor of Yale's dining halls, can talk 
about buying "10, 15, maybe 20,000 _ 
pou nds of an item" one moment and 
the next be on the telephone describing 
the specific knife someone needs: "I 
think that's the Dexter number 17. 
That's the knife you want. We buy 
them in H artford." It is a business 
based on volume. "On a good day we 
serve about 20,000 meals. That's 
4,000,000 per year," said Kenney OE 
'67). The dining halls operate on an 
$18 million budget, $6 million of 
which goes for food. At Yale, about 
820 people make the meals. T hey 
make them out of the 13,000 30-pound 
cases of frozen vegetables and fries that 
are ordered each year, out of the 
$65,000 worth of hard rolls and French 
Last April, they used 
7, 155 pounds of diced 
onions and 10, 100 
pounds of cut ~ettuce.
