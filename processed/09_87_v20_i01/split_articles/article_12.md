In his kitchen in Commons, Joseph 
Veronesi, chef, sat reading "Food 
Management" magazine. He wore a 
stained white coat and a white paper 
hat about a foot tall. Veronesi has 
cooked at Yale for 26 years since 
starting as second cook at the Law 
School. "The idea of the food here at 
Yale- it's more unique than anywhere 
( 
else. Yale is number one. You think of 
college food and you usually think of 
frozen food." Indeed, according to Al 
Kenney, Yale has sold its recipe file 
four times: to Princeton, Columbia, 
Notre Dame and Duke, each time for 
$20,000. Veronesi has tasted all the 
recipes: "Anything I wouldn't eat I 
manager, 
Stringer makes food out of numbers"'.
