Solid Progress 

While undergraduates fled 
New 
Haven for the summer, both TA 
Solidarity and the Graduate School 
administration separately made pro-
gress in their efforts to improve life for 
teaching 
assistants 
at Yale. 
Graduate School deans came up with 
the job descriptions that the TAs 
demanded last spring (TNJ 4/17/87). 
Fifteen core members of TA Solidarity 
planned to raise the group's profile this 
fall and dug up a law that may force 
Yale to modify its wage structure.  

TA Solidarity, a small but growing 
association of graduate students, 
formed last spring to address perceived 
problems with the TA system. This 
fall, the group plans a lobbying effort 
among students and faculty and a 
letter-writing campaign directed at 
Benno Schmidt to pressure the University 
into responding to 
their 
complaints. 

The University has already ad-
dressed 
one flaw 
in 
the TA 
system- the lack of detailed job 
descriptions and grading and teaching 
standards . 

According 
to Robert 
Bunselmeyer, associate dean of the 
Graduate 
School, 
committee of 
Graduate School deans wrote a new 
handbook for TAs which provides this 
information. Both administrators and 
TAs anticipate that the handbook, just 
recently published, will help to ensure 
greater understanding of responsi-
bilities and uniformity in grading. The 
handbook also speaks to first-timers, 
giving 
them information about 
teaching at Yale. 

Although they acknowledge the Uni-
versity's efforts, TAs still feel bitter 
about their financial woes. Their 
maximum earnings as teachers for the 
University, they claim, do not meet 
Yale's stated estimate for cost of living 
expenses in New Haven. "The real 
problem we have is just breaking 
through 
to the 
Administration, 
because whenever money is in ques-
tion, their tendency is to say no," said 
Karen Sawislak, a third-year student 
in history. As a member of TA Soli-
darity, she will seek support among her 
fellow graduate students as soon as 
they show up for registration this fall, 
urging them to write to Benno Schmidt 
about their finances. 

A number say that in addition to 
inadequate salaries, they encounter 
problems with late paychecks, espe-
cially when the rent is due. Eben 
Werber had been working at the Yale 
Law School library for over a month 
without receiving his first monthly 
check. His frustration led him to call 
the Connecticut Labor Board, whose 
head in the wages division stopped him 
mid-story: Yale was breaking the law, 
the man said, just by paying Werber 
on a monthly instead of a weekly 
schedule. 

Intrigued, Werber re-
searched statute no. 31-71 and learned 
that Connecticut law requires all 
employers in the state to pay their 
employees every week. Employers can 
obtain a waiver from the law, but Yale 
had none on record with the Board. 

Yale currently pays its professional 
staff, from TAs to Benno Schmidt, 
monthly. 

Werber said that after notifying Ken 
Miller, 
Yale's 
assistant general 
counsel, about the law, he received a 
hand-delivered paycheck from Yale the 
next day. Since that day last July, he 
and other TAs have been pushing the 
University to start paying them more 
frequently, threatening to file a civil 
claim form if Yale doesn't comply. 

"We're just at the point of deciding 
what the law says and how we have to 
respond to it," Miller said. He added 
that he knew of no university in 
Connecticut that pays its professional 
employees every week. 

While waiting for the University to 
make its decision, members of TA 
Solidarity are planning for the fall. 
They have a general meeting sche-
duled for the first week of classes, and a 
fundraising dance soon after that. 
They also plan to start selling buttons 
and T-shirts- both the color of money. 
They've discussed withholding grades 
at the end of the semester, but the 
threat remains muted. "It's not going 
to be the first thing we're going to do," 
said Sawislak. "We don't want to do 
anything confrontational 
without 
explaining our situation to the admini-
stration and giving them every chance 
to understand."

'Lipsticks' and Lords: Yale's New Look 

Yale's Makeover 

Nat Hentoff called 
it 
most 
courageous piece of journalism on 
higher education that he'd ever seen, 
but at Yale, outrage might be a better 
word to associate with Julie Iovine's 
article in The Wall Street Journal of 
August 4. Entitled "'Lipsticks' and 
Lords: Yale's New Look," Iovine's 
article makes Yale and its inhabitants 
seem 
well, just a 
little bit 
eccentric. From drag parades to food-
throwing bacchanals at the Rock-
ingham Club, Iovine chronicled some 
of Yale's more colorful events-and 
managed to offend students, admini-
strators and_especially alumni doing it. 

Iovine, 
Yale alumna who is 
married to literature professor Peter 
Demetz, said that she originally wrote
