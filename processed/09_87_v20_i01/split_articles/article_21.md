**Midwives and Home Births**
**Author: Jennifer Sachs**
**Page number(s): 40-41**

Helen Burst has seen the status of midwives evolve from obscurity to respectability. 
is committed to home birth as a philo-
sophical choice. "I have very poor 
patients on welfare, and I have patients 
from Stamford and Greenwich. I have 
stopped trying to say that there's a 
certain type of patient, because I don't 
think there is. The only thing they 
share is a desire for control over their 
own bodies," she says. They pay her on 
a sliding scale based on their financial 
status, since insurance does not pay for 
home births. It also does not cover 
Kirn in case of lawsuits, a fact which 
she says doesn't bother her. "It's not 
worth the profit for insurance com-
panies to sue me, it's not worth the 
hassle. My pockets aren't deep enough. 
And the people I deal with spiritually 
understand that life has its own flow." 
Like Lisk and Wittreich, Kirn offers 
women a constant supportive presence 
during their labor. Unlike the CNMs, 
she will do it wherever her client 
prefers. "I'U take her for walks. I'll take 
her to the mall. I don't want her to feel 
like she's a prisoner, or like there's 
anything wrong with her." She rejects 
the idea that Yale-New Haven's new 
birthing rooms provide women with 
sufficient comfort. "If you bark real 
loud, someone will throw you a bone. 
'Look, look at this hospital room! Look 
at the potted plant! Look at the bed, it 
looks just like a real one!' Things run 
deeper than that." 

While many CNMs and doctors 
agree that the hospital cannot match 
the privacy and comfort of a home 
birth, they dispute its wisdom. "The 
women who have 
n ever 
been 
nurses- they're the ones who are all for 
home birth. They've 
never seen 
anyone bleed to death," Wittreich says. 
Lisk appreciates the work that lay 
midwives do and 
says 
that she 
sometimes calls Kirn for advice. But, 
she adds, "They feel very righteous 
about what they are doing, and so do 
we." 

One viable alternative to home 
births might be the creation of a 
birthing center, which would offer 
women individualized attention and 
privacy but would 
provide 
for 
physician attendance and easy access 
to hospitals. In January of 1985, under ,. 
the joint auspices of a consumer group 
and some professors at the Nursing 
School, including Helen Burst, the 
Family Childbirth Center opened in 
the Temple Medical Building in New 
Haven. Not a Yale-affiliated projec:t, 


the center still received lip service from 
the medical school. However, after 
shutting down temporarily during the 
insurance crisis and reopening in 
November of 1985, 
the center 
underwent what Burst calls a "very 
efficient physician boycott" by most 
area OB-GYN specialists. In October 
• of 1986, with only a few clients and no 
expectation of forthcoming support, 
the birthing center closed its doors. 

Despite the quick failure of the 
birthing center, Burst has high hopes 
for a similar project in the future. "We 
went through every 
hoop, 
every 
bureaucratic procedure, in laying the 
groundwork. We proved it could be 
done, right here in Connecticut, right 
here in New H aven," she says. 

Marshall Holley says that he would 
have liked to admit patients to the 
Birthing Center but that the difficulties 
posed by splitting admissions with the 
hospital were too great, a problem1 
unlikely to be resolved in the near; 
future. And if Burst's assumption 
about the recalcitrance of doctors to 
support a birthing center is correct, a 
~ more profound change than a simple 
administrative success will be 
necessary to find a workable solution. 

For the time being, Burst says, she is 
concentrating on issues more readily 
resolved: in creased prescriptive 
authority, expanded hospital 
privileges, and a stable insurance 
policy. W ittreich's and Lisk's concerns 
are even more immediate. They 
revolve around the ringing of the tele-
phone that tells them one of their 
clients is about to go into labor. Then 
there will be the hours of sitting by the 
bedside, urging the woman to push, to 
breathe. After the baby is born, Linda 
Lisk will get a new picture or two for 
her wall. She probably won't be in it, 
''" b ut you'll know she's there.
