T he posters now appearing all over 
cam pus tell the story of an organi-
zation in flux- they list over a dozen 
positions available at WYBC, Yale's 
beleaguered radio station. YBC has 
faced more than its share of troubles in 
recent years. Just two years after the 
station shut down due to financial and 
organizational problems and reopened 
promising sweeping structural 
changes, YBC members have learned 
that two members of their executive 
board have resigned, charged with 
using 
corporate credit cards for 
personal purchases. 

According to Susan Takemoto (PC 
'88), the treasurer of YBC, one of the 
students approached her last year and 
asked her to supply employment veri-
fication for what she believed at the 
time was a 
personal credit card. 
H owever, when American Express is-
sued two cards in early 1987, they bore 
the names of the students and of YBC 
radio station. T he students then made 
almost $3000 worth of purchases on 
the 
American 
Express cards, 
at 
locations includ ing J. P ress, Quality 
Wines, Macy's Junior Dresses and 
Leather Goods departments, Brux· 
elles, Body and Sole, and local florist 
shops. YBC General Manager Colin 
Clarke said that "not one of these 
purchases could conceivably have been 
for the station." 

One of the students involved in the 
use of the credit cards conceded that 
some of his purchases were not for the 
station. He said, however, that his 
$900 bill included over $200 in albums 
for YBC's collection, and numerous 
restauran t 
tabs for meetings with 
advertising clients. 

The student 
claimed that he tried to pay the bill 
with a personal check sent via Dean 
Lloyd Suttle along with an explanation 
that YBC should not be held respon-
sible for the amount owed, but as of 
August 21 American Express h ad not 
received this payment. 

The other student, who declined to 
be interviewed, allegedly ran up a bill 
of about $2000 on his credit card. 
According to YBC, he paid $1200 
toward his account, using two station 
checks of $600 each. T akemoto said 
that she had presigned the first check 
for emergency expenses before she left 
for spring b reak last year. The second, 
she said, was presen ted to her as the 
bill for a car rental. R esponsibility for 
paying the balance of the accounts now 
falls to the two students; YBC does not 
plan to take any legal action unless 
American Express sues the station for 
repayment. 

Despite this recent embarrassment, 
YBC members hope that 1987 will be a 
banner year for them. They predict 
profits of $50,000, twice what they 
netted in 1986, and have bought a few· 
pieces of new equipment: a broadcast 
console, a more powerful transmitter, 
a new computer, and an antenna that 
will allow the station to broadcast at 
3500 watts.
