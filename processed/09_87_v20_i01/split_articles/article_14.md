"' We bought a lobster 
shell and looked at it 
to see how the pieces 
fit together. It was 
always sitting on the 
design table." 
24 The New JournaUSeptember 4, 1987 
At a construction site between a baseball field 
and Long Island Sound, "the fish" basks in 
the late August sun. Its arched wooden 
skeleton throws a web-like shadow on the 
deck, tracing lines over workers in t-shirts 
and cut-off jeans. A man with white hair and 
an anguW.r face catches sight of a flatbed truck 
moving across the field. Squinting up at the 
unfinished structure, swinging his arms and 
grinning, he cries, «Mary Beth, your trusses 
are here!" A minute later, a small woman in 
work boots and a W.rge yellow hard hat 
signals the tractor-trailer driver, who releases 
the heavy timber at her feet. Paul Brouard 
turns around. "Where else are you going to get 
experience like that?" 
Probably nowhere. These are not 
ordinary construction workers, and 
Paul Brouard is no ordinary foreman. 
They are Yale architecture students, 
building a bandshell for the Bridgeport 
Symphony in that city's Seaside Park 
as part of the School of Architecture's 
First Year Building Project. "The fish" 
is their own design and product, the 
result of months of furious labor in the 
studio and in the field. 
The wooden deck and six arched 
trusses look like the skeleton of an 
immense sea creature on the shoreline. 
In a curious process of reverse decay, 
more pieces appear each day, fleshing 
out the body. In its finished state, the 
three-story bandshell will have a 
curved plywood roof sheathed in 
copper shingles. When these oxidize in 
five to eight years, the cavernous shell 
will assume a scaly green appearance.
