bread. Last April, they used 7,155 
pounds of diced onions and 10,100 
pounds of cut lettuce. In one week in 
October, they spent $60,000 on meat. 
"It's a rather large operation," Kenney 
explained. 

Bulk volumes can tell only part of 
the story, however. No less astounding 
than the quantity of each item is the 
variety of foods that the dining halls 
serve at each meal. At all lunches and 
dinners, the standard services other 
than the salad bar include about 30 
different foods, drinks and condiments- two types of milk and juice, 
five ground spices, granola, pudding, 
Jell-0, 
ice cream, 
flavored and 
unflavored yogurt. The salad bar alone 
offers about 20 selections, ranging 
from cottage cheese to four kinds of 
salad dressings, one of which must be 
diet. 

And those are just the standard 
services. The dining halls also provide 
at least three entrees at dinner, one of 
which is vegetarian and all of which 
contain between three and ten ingredients. At least one starch, one hot 
vegetable and one featured dessert, 
usually baked, accompany the entrees. 
To us, it may be just dinner, the three 
or four items on our plates, the excuse 
for a break and the brunt of bad jokes. 
To the dining hall workers, it represents 
the culmination of a furious 
process that began at least months 
before: someone invented and tested 
the recipes, organized the menu, 
ordered the food, unloaded the trucks 
at three in the morning, mixed the 
ingredients, cooked them, and served 
it all up- hot and on time. Particle 
acceleration and genetic engineering 
notwithstanding, food service may be 
the most complex process at Yale. 

For chicken basquaise, that process 
began nearly a year ago. Tom De-
Dinas, Yale's executive chef, prepared 
24 portions of the dish for the "test 
kitchen," the standard trial for any 
potential addition to the menu. A 
group of Yale dining hall administrators 
and managers sampled and 
approved the dish for aroma, taste and 
texture. Having passed this scrutiny, 
chicken basquaise joined the 2600 
other recipes in Yale's file. Because 
cooks are expected to follow all recipes 
exactly, every plate of Yale's chicken 
basquaise should taste as good as the 
first. 

Having left a message with Grut-
man's 
roommate, 
DeDinas 
was 
disappointed when the 
recipe's 
conveyor failed to show up for the test 
kitchen. DeDinas encourages student 
involvement in the food service. A 
large man with thinning blonde hair 
and a meat thermometer tucked in his 
breast pocket, he reported that although 
he has always welcomed recipe 
ideas from undergraduates, they have 
rarely suggested dishes. "I'd like to see 
more input from the students," he said. 

A few new items find their way on to 
the menu each year, usually the result 
of DeDinas' experiments or a dining 
hall manager's vague report of a meal 
enjoyed elsewhere. 

DeDinas said that planning special 
menus often exposes him to new recipes. Last year's African Night, for 
example, yielded one of his favorites: 
"ground nut stew," which includes 
peanut butter in the gravy. Though he 
admitted that "a lot of people were 
turned off by the name," he said that it 
was a popular dish and will reappear 
on the menu 
this year. 

Student 
response, he explained, determines 
which recipes survive. "If we get a lot 
of complaints to the dining hall 
managers saying 'We don't like that 
stuff,' we'll pull that recipe from the 
file." He shrugged. "We won't serve 
something they don't like." Students' 
reactions ended the brief career of 
"pizza quiche" last year. 

The warm reception chicken 
basquaise received at the test kitchen 
has made DeDinas hopeful about its 
future. "It's a very attractive dish, with 
the peppers and the tomatoes." Karen 
Dougherty, who attended the test kitchen, shares DeDinas' enthusiasm. As 
Yale's executive dietician, Dougherty 
heads the committee of food service 
administrators and dining hall 
managers that plans Yale's menu. The 
committee maintains a straightforward 
philosophy: "We aim for pleasing most 
of the people most of the time, and we 
acknowledge that there will be times 
when it doesn't turn you on. Someday 
you'll want that beef chop suey, but 
right now it's not what those taste buds 
had in mind." 

Like DeDinas, Karen Dougherty is 
a true believer in Yale's food. Along 
with all 
other 
management-level 
"Someday you'll want 
that beef chop suey, 
but right now it's not 
what those taste buds 
dining hall employees, Dougherty eats 
regularly in Yale's facilities. She spoke 
energetically about prized recipes, her 
voice easily heard over the roar of her 
air conditioner. The dining hall's 
popular pumpkin bread came from her 
own recipe, and Yale's green bean and 
ground beef casserole ranks as one of 
her favorite dishes. "I don't know, 
there's just something about it that I 
like a lot. So if I eat GBGB casserole, 
which I like a lot, and it doesn't taste 
right, I'll go in there and say, 'What the 
heck did you guys do today?'" 

Dougherty explained that satisfying 
nutritional standards did not present a 
problem for chicken basquaise. Yale's 
dining halls offer elements of the four 
basic food groups at every meal. "We 
always have bread out, we always have 
milk out, we always have vegetables


and fruit out," Dougherty said. "It's a 
piece of cake." Scanning the menu for 
the evening of September 15, she said 
that students should eat their chicken 
basquaise with rice rather than noodles; broccoli normandy rather than 
apple beignets, which are tasty but 
high in calories; and a green salad. For 
dessert, they could eat either the 
canned pear halves or the fudge 
cookie. She suggested that students 
should drink 
milk with 
the 
meal-"skim, 
not 
whole." Tom 
DeDinas recommended a chablis. 

Finding a spot on the menu for a 
new item is more difficult than meeting 
nutritional requirements. Dougherty 
explained that the menu committee 
follows certain basic rules: "We pair 
something popular with something 
unpopular . . . . You'd never put 
Brussel sprouts and beets on at the 
same time." She waved her hands. 
"You'd get a suggestion box stuffed 
with hate mail." Certain foods, like 
fish, can be served up to four times a 
week without generating complaints. 
Chicken, 
however, 
cannot appear 
more than three times. She said that 
chicken basquaise should not be served 
beside another dish containing 
tomatoes. "You want it to stand out on 
the steam table. You do a lot of eating 
with your eyes, and you want to see a 
variety of colors so it doesn't all look 
the same." 

Chicken basquaise will be going up 
against pasta primavera and shrimp 
chow mein- stiff competition. Dougherty 
and DeDinas both believe it will 
fare well, but after placing it on the 
menu they can no longer control its 
fate. At this point, the dining hall 
managers take over. 

Dining hall managers are on the 
front line of food service at Yale. They 
are ultimately responsible for the 
quality of the product and service at all 
27 of Yale's dining facilities. They 
make sure that the food is hot, that the 
ingredients 
and 
condiments are 
stocked, that the workers are clean and 
happy. They plan special events. If 
there's a party, they stay until it ends. 
If there's an equipment failure, they 
cope. As manager of Commons, Ed 
Ley oversees the feeding of between 
1500 and 1600 people twice a day and 
coordinates the two or three special 
meals that Commons might be hosting. In addition, major functions like 
the Walter Camp dinner take place in 
Commons, and the bake shop in its 
basement turns out baked goods for all 
the dining halls. Employees are at 
work there from three in the morning 
until ten at night. "It's big, it's 
extremely big, what we do here," Ley 
said. Barring equipment malfunctions, 
however, he said that the situation 
stays under control: "On an average 
day to the average individual, it may 
appear to be chaos, but to us it's 
organized chaos . . . . To those of us 
who know the assignments, it makes 
sense." 

Though they operate on a smaller 
scale, college dining hall managers also 
must confront chaos daily. If you catch 
sight of a manager at meal time, he's 
probably in motion; if you try to talk to 
him, he probably stays that way. One 
afternoon, Ed Homa, area manager of 
Stiles-Morse, stood beside a stack of 
trays containing breaded veal patties, 
each neatly topped with a dab of 
tomato sauce and a sprinkling of 
grated parmesan cheese. The dinner 
rush would come in an hour or so. "I've 
got PROP on that side," he said, 
gesturing toward the Morse dining 
hall, "and football on that side." He 
pointed toward Stiles. "Those boys eat 
everything." He said that a manager's 
hours aren't bad- usually from 8:30 in 
the morning until seven at night-but 
that the nature of the work is stressful. 
"When it's lunchtime, that has to be 
ready. When it's dinnertime, that has 
to be ready. In that sense, there's a 
certain amount of pressure. When 
you're in this business, it's part of your 
life." But the job has rewards as well. 
Homa said that he enjoys his contact 
with students. "We all 
take our 
everyday meals- breakfast, lunch and 
dinner-as routine. 
But Freshman 
Dinner's coming up, and we're all 
working our tails off to do a good job. 
When someone comes up and says, 
'You did a good job,' that's a great


feeling. That's what we're shooting 
for." 

Eric Uscinski moved through the 
ranks from dishwasher to assistant 
director of Yale's dining halls. Now 
working out of the central offices at 294 
Elm Street, he said that he misses the 
"instant gratification" that comes from 
feeding hungry students. As manager 
of Branford-Saybrook, he organized a 
special breakfast last year for April 
Fool's Day that included linen table-
cloths and student waiters. The menu 
featured 
fresh 
strawberry and 
blueberry crepes. "We always get 
requests for those New York bagels, so 
I went down there and got them for 
'em." But Uscinski doesn't miss the 
pressure of managing two dining halls. 
The kitchen equipment, some of it 15 
years old, frequently broke down. Last 
year, the dishwashing machine in 
Branford was down for three days in a 
row. One hundred and five stairs 
separate the Branford and Saybrook 
kitchens, and he climbed up and down 
them about 40 times each day. 

Beyond ensuring that everything in 
the kitchen and dining areas is running 
smoothly at each meal, the managers 
must plan ahead. For each of the 20 or 
so special items that might appear on 
Yale's menu in a given day, the 
managers turn 
recipes 
into 
numbers and the numbers into food. 
In Commons, which serves so many 
people that four men share the mana-
ger's responsibilities, Michael Stringer 
(DC '77) orders the food and makes 
sure that it arrives on time. 

A corridor stretches the length of 
Commons' basement. The rooms that 
open from it hold food-lots of food. In 
one, a pile of 50-pound bags of sugar 
sits beside a stack of 50-pound sacks of 
"Danish Deluxe Mix." Another room 
stocks grocery items: 55-pound tubs of 
Fig Square Filling, one-gallon bottles 
of Gourmet French Dressing, a stack 
of ten cases of Heinz Tomato Ketchup-each case containing six cans at 
seven pounds apiece. Hoses labeled 
"Lemon," "Red" and "Coke" snake 
from boxes of syrup up through the 
ceiling to the soda machines in the 
serving line above. Ken Jones, Commons' head general services assistant, 
surveyed the room and shook his head. 
"We water it and it grows overnight." 

In the past three days, he had helped 
cart in 24,000 pounds of supplies. 

In rooms where you can see your 
breath, bags of diced carrots, tubs of 
lettuce and boxes of frozen fish await 
their fate. Three mixers stand in the 
bakery, each as tall as a man and 
operated with a manual clutch. Down 
at the corridor's end, you can glimpse 
the kitchen's gleaming bank of ovens. 
Midway between the beginning of the 
corridor and the kitchen sits Stringer's 
office. 

"Involved with cube steaks" at Yale's Long Wharf Commissary. 
Michael Stringer always knew he 
wanted to work in food service. At 
Yale, he studied administrative 
sciences and worked in the dining 
halls. As his graduation approached, 
"It's big, it's extremely 
big, what we do here." 
he was offered a job as an assistant 
manager of Commons. "I had two 
weeks off and boom!- I started here." 
He worked as an assistant manager 
and manager of other dining facilities 
around Yale but returned to Commons 
last fall. "It's obviously a very big 
place," he said. As production manager, Stringer is responsible for the 
ordering and shipping of all food. He 
knows a lot of numbers: If it's hamburgers for lunch, he orders 300 
pounds of meat. "That's 12 to 1500 
burgers at three ounces each, and 75 in 
a case at 15 pounds total." Ordering 
food requires more than knowing 
numbers, however. Stringer seems to 
employ a combination of scientific 
management, 
pop psychology and 
hope.
