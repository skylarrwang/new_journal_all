the piece for Vogue, intending it to be a 
fairly lighthearted look at new trends 
on campus. But her subjects have 
apparently taken her seriously, delu-
ging the journal with letters contesting 
what they say are inaccuracies in 
Iovine's reporting. Early in the piece, 
Iovine wrote that one of her subjects 
"received a notice before registering 
freshman year that said one in · four 
Yale students was gay." Dean of 
Student Affairs Betty Trachtenberg, 
who supervises freshman mailings, 
contends that no such pamphlet was 
distributed. "We don't even keep 
statistics like that," she said. And Sara 
Cohen, the student who allegedly 
made the remark, charged that Iovine 
"grossly misrepresented" her. 
Fritz Reichenbach, president of the 
Rockingham Club, also disputed Io-
vine's portrayal <;>f his organization. In 
a letter published in the Journal of 
August 21, Reichenbach attacked Io-
vine's "lack of ti~ativity and sense of 
adventure." He 
called 
her "con-
descending" attitude toward his club 
"odd, since she reveled in the same 
excess as we" during a visit. Iovine 
laughed at this comment. "I didn't 
throw any food, give me a break. I had 
a good time- I drank a lot of cham-
pagne-but I didn't throw food." 
Many Yale alumni, however, are 
not amused. Trachtenberg reported 
that "the wires are really burning" with 
calls from angry graduates, and college 
deans are preparing for questions from 
worried parents. At least one dean has 
made "Lipsticks' and Lords" required 
reading for her freshman counselors, 
so that they can correct mistaken 
impressions left by the article. One 
that Iovine will concede: a person who 
studies too much is called a dweeb, not 
a "tweeb." "That one was mv editor's 
fault," she said. "H e said it w~s tweeb. 
and he sounded so sure of himself. so I 
ga"e in."

her article has created. "I just went in

minds, was what I wrote about. I was 
going to do political stuff, but it's so 
obviously in abeyance right now that 
there didn't seem to be a point to going 
into it." Did she, as some critics have 
charged, write the piece in anger? "No, 
of course not! I love Yale!" 


**Everybody In**

In the Yale Alumni Weekly of October 
29, 1915, an article about the new Yale 
Club of Manhattan touted its "com-
plete Turkish bath establishment," 
where a Yale man could enjoy a sauna 
and an alcohol rub or oil massage. 
Ever since 1915, men have strolled 
from the locker room to the steam 
room and then into the pool- all in th~ 
nude. First admitted in 1974, women 
members have had to forego the joys of 
the Turkish bath. But by the end of 
September, costly renovations will give 
women access to the pool. They will 
have their own sauna and masseuse, 
too. 

"I don't know why the women in the 
Yale Club have gotten all upset," said 
Thorn Pak (ES '86), a trader for 
Kidder Peabody. "The pool is really 
tiny. It's like a small tub." Pak never 
uses the pool himself but says he sees 
"naked, fat old men there all the time. 
It should be very interesting to see 
what happens when it goes co-ed." 

If women are not welcomed into the 
pool with open arms, at least they can 
count on continuing to use the rest of 
the Club. They can even have their 
hair cut at the barbershop on the 
seventh floor. At five dollars, it gives 
the cheapest haircuts in town- what 
one 
member called "a regular 
conservative old cut." "Yeah, I cut 
women's hair," the barber said. "I give 
'ern all a crew cut." 

Other innovations abound. This 
year undergraduates got the chance to 
use the Yale Club during the summer 
for a mere 50 dollars, though they had 
to pay 50 more to use the athletic 
facilities. Forty-three Yalies joined, 
and on Thursday nights brought 
guests to the 22nd floor for cocktail 
hour. Hundreds of summer interns 
swarmed over the complimentary hors 
d'oeuvres, took in the view of midtown 
Manhattan from the rooftop terrace, 
and charged drinks to their hosts' 
accounts. "It's like a SAC party with 
wanna-be grownups," said Kevin 
Kiernan (SM '88), a summer employee 
at First Boston Investment Bank. 

Those who wanna be must dress 
accordingly. 
The 
Yale 
Club still 
strictly enforces its dress code, which 
even the employees must observe. In 
the white marble lobby the doormen 
wear livery suitable for decorated army 
generals and the desk clerks all sport 
navy blue suits, white shirts, and blue 
ties. "They make us wear blue," Joe 
Genty said with a 
grimace. ' He 
manages the lobby's gift shop which 
sells, among other things, cigars, 
cigarettes, 
Turns, 
Dentyne, Old 
Campus stationery, Bulldog paper-
weights, Yale pennants, Yale tote bags, 
Yale beach towels, and men's ties 
embroidered with residential college 
insignias. The gift shop also carries a 
businesswoman's navy bow tie with 
little white Y's sprinkled on it. Not his 
best selling item , Genty admitted. 

But the dress code seems unlikely to 
go the way of the aquatic n udes. A 
recen t graduate who used to wear tie-
dyed t·shirts and army surplus pants at 
Yale showed up at the Club one 
Thursday evening this summer in a 
gray pinstripe suit, a white shirt, and a 
red tie, and confessed that he was 
working for a law firm in the city. 
"But," he said, turning around so his 
friends could see a tiny·wisp of a pony 
tail at the back of his head, "I haven't 
sold ou t, not yet."
