The pictures cover most of the wall:

Hundreds of pictures, with qozens 
more scattered across Linda Lisk's 
desk. Most show mothers with their 
newborn children- children 
still 
bloody, their umbilical cords still 
-attached and clearly visible. Linda 
often appears on the periphery: the 
pair of hands holding the baby next to 
its mothert belly, the blue-gowned 
figure by the cornet of the bed. This 
suits herjust fine; alfer all, she isn't the 
one having the child.

public ignorance, professional skep-
ticism and the high cost of medical 
i~e have made it difficult for 
nurse-midwives to find employment in 
many parts of the country. New 
Ha~n, bolstered by a tertiary care 
hosjital and Yale Medical School, 
offers 
a 
relatively 
supportive 
~nvitbnment for CNMs. The numbtlr 
of births supervised by nurse-midwi~es 
greatly exceeds the national figure of 
between two and four percent of all 
deliveries- by one estimate, 
they 
handle as many as 25 percent. But 
even in New Haven, which boasts one 
of only 
28 
nurse-midwife degree 
programs in the country, midwives 
face a difficult time finding acceptance. 
In Europe midwives are responsible 
for 60 to 80 percent of deliveries, but 
tnany Americans now view them as a 
curiosity, an anomaly in this age of 
specialized medicine. 

The influence of doctors in obste-
trical care has developed only over the 
last century, with particular force in 
the United States. Until the early 
1900s, a predominantly immigrant 
population of midwives provided 
primary care for pJegruUU women. 
Doctors, whose own sta(US had not yet 
reached complete respectability, began • 
to suggest that these midwives were

she says. Before she became a 
rn"n"""'"• Lisk worked as a regis-
(RN) on the labor and 
floor, where, she says, "l 
things being done to women 
outrageous." Now, she describes 
herself aa a feminist who has chosen a 
more active role in changing the 
treatment of women, 

"The perception is that you're a 
retonstituted hippie." Sue Andrews, 
an assistapf professor of certified 
nurse-midwifery at the Yale School of 
Nursing, leans back in her chair and 
amiles. "But most CNMs are in one 
way or another feminists-we believe 
that women need to be empowered." 
Dressed in t-shirt and shorts, Andrews 
looks somehow out of place in her 
office, 
which 
is crammed with 
textbooks and stacks of papers. She 
came to the School of Nursing in 1981 
from Oregon. where she had been an 
RN and before that, an English 
teacher. Yale offers two tracks to a 
master's degree in nurse-midwifery: a 
two-year program for registered nurses 
like Andrews and Lisk and an unusual 
three-year program for people with no 
previous nursing experience. After 
receiving her certification from the 
American College of Nurae-Midwives, 
Andrews stayed at Yale to teach .• 
also became director of the Num..t 
School-affiliated Yale 
Midwifery Practice, the only private".-.;;a-;,.,.,.;;c«<l
practice in New Haven run and 
operated by the CNMs themselves. 
The practice will dose at the end of 
September due to 
decline jn 
enrollment at the nursing school that 
forced administratqrs to target ~ir :l\. 
limited funds elsewhere. Still, its staff 
says, during 13 years of operation it 
served as a 
prototy~ for similar 
programs nationwide. 

\ndrews chose to enter a career in 
academia rather than to concentrate on 
an active practice. Lisk wanted a more 
immediate remedy for the treatment of 
women that she had witneaed on the 
labOr and delivery floor. 

After 
certification, 
she joined the New 
Haven-based OB-GYN pl'8dic:e ol Dr. 
Marshall Holley; they both insist that 
she works with him, not for him. 
Holley now has rwo nunc-midwives in

supports us," Lisk says. She and 
Debbie Cibelli, the other CNM in 
Holley's practice, provide all of the 
prenatal care and counseling for 
normal women with no health risks. In 
Connecticut, CNMs cannot prescribe 
medication, so Holley signs prescrip-
tions for drugs or vitamins. Once a 
woman goes into labor, Lisk or Cibelli 
stays with her until she delivers- for 
five hours or two days, however long 
the labor takes. Holley usually does not 
show up in the patient's room until the 
child begins to appear, and he does not 
interfere unless the birth requires sur-
gical procedure, which CNMs cannot 
perform. 

Holley, a genial man who sports ties 
decorated with tiny tennis racquets, 
speaks highly of the kind of care that 
CNMs provide. "My style of prac-
ticing medicine is one of being laid 
back, as natural as possible, giving the 
patients choice of what's going on and 
36 The New J ournal/Septe-mber 4. 1987 
ability to make a decision," he says. 
"Midwives give the patients someone 
in labor with them." In addition to 
providing emotional support through-
out labor and delivery, Lisk and 
Cibelli also encourage the woman to be 
more aware of what's happening to 
her. "We try and get women to watch 
what they're doing. We'll try and get 
her to reach down, to feel the baby's 
head. We try not to make this a sterile 
procedure- because that really isn't 
the most sterile area, although people 
try to make it so," Lisk explains. Her 
method of care involves allowing the 
woman to choose her own position, in 
the bed or out of it. "Some women 
want to squat on the floor on their 
hands and knees while they give birth. 
That's fine, it's perfectly normal." In 
fact, many doctors, as well as mid-
wives, feel that the standard position of 
birth, lying in bed with both feet 
encased in stirrups, actually hampers 
delivery by forcing a woman to work 
against gravity. 

Indeed, the line that separates 
midwifery from physician care has 
faded in recent years as hospitals 
respond to a tr~nd calling for "natural" 
medicine. According to Tracy Wit-
treich, a CNM in private practice with 
three other nurse-midwives and four 
physicians, Yale-New Haven Hospital 
has made great strides in providing a 
comfortable environment for expectant 
mothers. Now, instead of giving birth 
in a large common room where privacy 
is provided only by curtains, women 
can use private or semiprivate birthing 
rooms. Some of these offer television 
sets , 
individual showers and 
wallpaper, in an effort to make the 
setting for birth as, homey as possible. 
More important, most birthing rooms 
now contain flexible "borning beds," 
which allow women to change 
positions during labor. 

"Yale really seems fairly progressive 
to me," Wittreich says. She notes that 
when Yale-New Haven renovated its 
facilities, nurses and midwives were 
consulted about what the new birthing 
rooms should look like. But she admits 
that hospital procedure occasionally 
frustrates her. "There are certain 
things you get sucked into doing in a 
hospital," she says. Yale-New Haven 
insists that a doctor attend every 
delivery, if only to observe, and urges 
the use of highly technical machinery 
such as fetal monitors and ultrasound. 
Fetal monitors, which track a baby's 
heartbeat, require that the mother lie 
in bed, not squat on the floor. Lisk 
insists that monitors rarely offer 
helpful information in low-risk cases, 
but hospital administrators prefer to 
minimize the chance of malpractice 
suits by using every available 
technology on mother and child. 
Their concern 
stems from 
insurance crisis in medicine, which has 
had an especially strong effect on 
obstetrics. Vulnerable to lawsuits and 
aware that a damaged chi:d evokes 
strong sympathy from a jury, OB-
GYN practitioners face the highest 
insurance premiums of any medical 
subspecialty, and many doctors have 
limited their practice to GYN as a
