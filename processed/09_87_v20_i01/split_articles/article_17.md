Herbert Newman and Thomas Beeby society helped found the project in the 1960s, and the first few classes journeyed to rural Appalachia to build federally funded community centers. 
Environmental concerns prevailed in the seventies; classes designed camps and cabins in local forests. In the late seventies and eighties, a preoccupation with formal and aesthetic concerns produced several small, stylized pavilions. 
Some students want the project to tackle societal problems in the original spirit of the program, but most feel content with the education it provides.


Brouard believes that "today's students are still very interested in building, but in a context more appropriate to the way they think. They see it as an advantage to their careers." Though he stresses that the Seaside Park bandshell will be a useful addition to the community, he believes that the class should sometimes deal with issues of more current social importance, such as homeless people and low-cost housing. 
Thomas Beeby, dean of the Yale School of Architecture, suggests that the current program could investigate such projects but cautions against losing sight of the educational philosophy. "Architecture is a generalist profession. It has to encompass technical, intellectual and artistic activities all underneath one roof, and there is a shifting of interest from one aspect to another. I think it is the duty of architectural schools to sustain that generalist notion of architecture, to protect all those different interests. The building project is a symbol of the school's interest in the idea that architecture and building are connected in a truly integrated way." He credits this philosophy with sustaining the building project amid waning social concern but emphasizes that evolving student interests do affect the project. 


At one in the morning on the seventh floor of the A and A, Layng Pew, Bob Tucker, Kevin Killen, and Mary Beth Vogel gather around the presentation model and discuss their options. It is late August, and time is running short. The superstructure is nearly complete, lacking only a few purlins. School will soon begin, however, and they will almost certainly not have time to sheath the bandshell in plywood or to apply its distinctive copper roof Layng suggests using asphalt shingles instead of copper to save time, but the idea doesn't go over well. "what about finishing it next May?" someone asks, but Kevin reminds them that Brouard will be busy with next year's class. They throw out more schemes and try to envision each one on the model, shingled only halfway to demonstrate the sequence of materials. 
School has begun, and the bandshell stands unfinished. The size of the project and the diminished student crew will prevent completion by Labor Day, when Bridgeport wanted to hold an opening concert, and will certainly keep students from finishing the bandshell themselves. For several weeks, they thought that they would also have to sacrifice the copper roof for inferior materials, but Bridgeport agreed to retain it after some discussion According to a tentative plan, a private contractor will apply plywood sheathing to weatherproof the structure before winter while the class starts handmaking the copper shingles. Students will install these next May. 


Mary Beth Vogel, one of the four originators of the design, has seen the project grow from the miniature model to one showing construction detail to the actual structure in Seaside Park. Remembering the day the original group conceived of the dramatic form, she is pleased with its translation into reality. "I feel that the general image is the same. It evolved the way it wanted to and can respond in a good way."


The students are still meeting with the various clients to resolve the roof design. Brouard sees this as all part of the education. "It's a good experience for them, because they're going to be in on it. They have to make some of the decisions and commitments for carrying it out, if they want to fulfill to the best of their capabilities that image." 
Tom Beeby explains that students need an intimate knowledge of construction to judge when they can and cannot compromise. He believes that the importance of the building project lies in showing students how to turn a design into a building without betraying their original ideas. "You have to protect your images against the onslaught of reality. You have to protect your idea, even though there's a lot of reasons to change it to something less interesting." 
The studio is dark now, the building empty. Sheets of yellow trace paper covered with rough sketches and construction details litter the drawing boards. On a table in the back sits the model, half of it roofed in warm copper, half of it bare. Its cavernous opening issues a silent challenge, taunting the students. And waiting for sunlight.
