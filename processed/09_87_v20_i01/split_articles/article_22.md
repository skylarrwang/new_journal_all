The scene: an anonymous Middle 
Eastern nation. The time: now. The 
plot: 
thickening. The 
beautiful 
princess Aliza lies comatose, stabbed 
in the chest in an assassination attempt 
ordered by her power-hungry cousin 
Turek. If Aliza dies, her husband Al-
Benir must forfeit power to Turek. But 
the princess must not only stay alive: 
unless the royal couple can somehow 
produce a son within three years, the 
reform-minded Al-Benir will have to 
step down. The princess shows no 
signs of recovery, and time is running 
out. The logistics sound daunting in 
Dr. Mary Lake Polan's thriller, Second 
Seed. But perhaps even more intriguing 
than the plot is the fact that an 
associate professor from Yale Medical 
School wrote this type of noveL 

Although the law "publish or perish" 
rules tenure these days, this book is 
probably not what the committee had 
in mind. 

The novel isn't a whodunnit. It's a 
can-they-do-it: Can the princess still 
conceive and bear a child? Polan, a 
reproductive 
endocrinologist and 
gynecologist, should know. As an 
associate professor in the Medical 
School with both M.D. and Ph.D. 
degrees, Polan has studied infertility 
and its remedies, including in-vitro 
fertilization. Although her background 
might undermine an entertainment 
novel by burdening it with a scholarly 
tone and multisyllabic words lacking 
an appropriate number of vowels, it 
doesn't here. In fact, the medical 
descriptions are the book's most 
authentic. 

As a medical novel, Second Seed 
educates about in-vitro fertilization 
and also implicitly questions the uses 
and abuses of today's technology. But 
don't be scared away. 
This isn't 
Organic Chemistry- it's 
more like 
.. General Hospital." As a suspense 
thriller, 
Second Sud successfully 
entertains. 

The plot becomes more complex 
when Polan exchanges the Middle 
Eastern country, Al-Benir and 
company for a new set and new 
characters. The curtain rises on, not so 
surprisingly, 
a 
small city 
in 
Connecticut. In this mild locale, a 
Yuppie couple debates whether or not 
to have a child. She's a doctor, he's a 
lawyer, she wants the kid and he says 
OK. Don't worry- it gets interesting. 

An ectopic pregnancy leaves Beth, the 
heroine, unable to conceive by the 
usual means. Instead, she resolves to 
undergo in-vitro fertilization and 
convinces 
her skeptical husband, 
David, to agree to the operation. 

While most people recognize the 
term "test-tube baby," few grasp the 
actual process involved in making one. 
Polan translates in-vitro fertilization 
into layperson's terms. Her version 
runs thus: After taking medicine to 
make her ovulate, Beth is ready for Dr. 
Joshua Wolff to operate and "harvest" 
her eggs. 

He picked the ovary up and held it 
suspended in the middle of the belly 
... Taking the needle. he angled it 
downward until it was poised just 
over the top of the first follicle .... 
"Get ready," said Richards. 
"Suck." He plunged the needle 
directly into the center of the fluid-
filled cyst. 
"You've got it." 

After vacuuming out Beth's follicle, 
Dr. Wolff combines the eggs with the 
sperm in a dish until they fertilize and 
start to divide. Then he reinserts the 
fertilized eggs into her uterus. But 
here's the twist: Al-Benir and Wolff 
were college chums (Harvard, of 
course). Princess Aliza cannot carry a 
child to term. And we know that, while 
comatose, PrinceJs Aliza underwent 
the same operation. So the reader 
wonders: whose child is it-Beth and 
David's or Aliza and Al-Benir's? 

Though medical technology appears 
primarily as a constructive tool in 
Second Seed, Polan explores its negative 
side as well. Thanks to modern 
medicins:, Beth can become pregnant. 
But because of a doctor's weakness; she 
becomes 
political 
pawn. 
Technology's values Polan suggests, 
depends upon the person who wields it. 
1 ecnnotogy's value, Polan suggests, 

After becoming pregnant, 
Beth 
notices strange cars stalking her. When 
she confides her anxieties to David, he 
ignores them. Instead, Beth must turn 
to 
her secretary, 
who 
intuitively 
believes that someone is trying to kill 
her boss. Throughout Second Seed, 
Polan portrays a world dominated by 
men. Beth survives through brains, 
resolve 
and 
luck, 
cajoling and 
outthinking men to achieve her goals. 

As David says, she is "one determined 
lady." And her drive enables her to 
endure and overcome any obstacles 
presented by men. Strangely, while 
Polan characterizes women as capable 
and strong-willed, she fails to develop 
any female characters other than Beth. 
The men share the limelight, while the 
rest of the women remain "shadowy 
characters at best. 

Almost uniformly, Polan depicts
