proficient nailer of shingles the 
construction company had ever seen. 

First thing the next morning I 
smashed my thumb with a hammer. 
The tender skin beneath my thumbnail 
turned purple, then black. 

That afternoon, returning late from 
lunch, I brought Timeless Beauty with 
me to work. Throughout the remain-
der of the afternoon I took countless 
illegal breaks, so that while all the 
other fellows 
were 
building with 
shingles, I was reading about them. 
Shortly after three o'clock I flattened 
my hand with a hammer again. This 
time the wound bled profusely, and my 
red-faced foreman sent me home with 
an angry warning that I had better 
shape up. I spent the. rest of the day 
and most of the evening reading 
Timeless Beauty. With midnight 
approaching, I recalled a key passage 
from War and Peace relevant to red 
cedar shingles, and sprinted eagerly to 
the bookshelf to remove my copy of the 
classic. My eyes soon welled · with 
tears, as I made what I considered my 
most startling literary discovery :-.yet: 
Tolstoy, in his spectacular and very, 
very long novel War and Peace, (I said to 
myself) betrays 
a 
certain self-
consciousness about the weakness of 
his book's structure in the absence of 
red cedar shingles. In Book III, 
Tolstoy describes the destruction by 
fire of a Russian barn, an unmis-
takable symbol for the Russian novel 
itself, as he anticipates the inevitable 
figurative collapse his work will 
undergo when compared with shingle 
narratives of the future: "The walls 
were all in flames and the back had 
fallen in ... The crowd was obviously 
waiting to see the roof fall in." 

If Tolstoy had employed red cedar 
shingles as 
literary device, 
I 
reasoned, the barn would 
most 
certainly be more durable, and the 
edifice of his novel- and indeed of all 
Slavic literature- would today stand 
taller and without doubt more pleasing 
to the eye.

complex literary 
as I mopped my 
a salty sweat stung 
the cuts on my fingers, stopping me 
abruptly mid-exegesis. 

Staring at 
Timeless Beauty through the parted 
digits of my battered, bleeding hands, 
I reflected on my life since the fateful 
arrival of the "Free Literature." 
What had I done? I · asked myself. 
My hands were mere bloody stumps. 
My work had suffered atrociously. I 
had come to the conclusion that 
Timeless Beauty, 
a shingle catalog, 
embodies the entire Western and 
Slavic literary traditions, cnttques 
them, and then goes further 
extending beyond them tran-
scending them. But how much more 
did I now know about shingles? 

And as I pondered all that had 
happened to me during the previous 
week, I grew increasingly hot and 
uncomfortable. The sweat had become 
unbearable. Shifting my weight in my 
chair, I sensed uneasily that despite my 
best intentions, my thighs had begun 
to stick to a certain layer of clear plastic 
and I still had only a vague notion of 
what the fabric really felt like.
