About a dozen workers are making 
purlins, structural ribs that connect 
and stiffen the trusses. They work in 
teams. Students up on the scaffolding 
call measurements down to others, 
who custom cut each two-by-eight and 
hand it up for fitting. Often the angles 
are off, requiring one, maybe two 
adjustments. 

Even with 
a 
team 
working at each side of the deck, only 
three purlins go up per hour. "They 
call this architorture," Layng Pew says 
from his perch in the scaffolding. 
The First Year Building Project is 
an annual event for the School of 
Architecture and an integral part of its 
three-year curriculum, in which three 
aemesters of practical training prepare 
students for conceptual design studios. 
Begun in 1965 by Charles Moore, 
dean of the school at the time, the 
project seeks to acquaint previously 
desk-bound students with the process 
of building. In the field, they draw on a 
year of "core" training that covers 
structures, 
materials, 
heating and 
ventilating, acoustics , lighting, 
fireproofing, plumbing and electrical 
systems. 

Richard Song had never built 
anything before coming to Yale. 
"Construction has opened my eyes in a 
different way toward architecture. 
Prior to this I would look at a building 
in terms of design and spatial qualities. 
Now I look at what materials are used 
and how they are joined." 

The project introduces students to 
all aspects of building. Yale contracts 
with a client, usually a city govern-
ment or other non-profit group, who 
agrees to fund the materials and 
support services, such as excavation, 
electricity and food. 
Under Paul 
Brouard's direction, the students serve 
as architects and builders. In March of 
their first year they break up into 
teams of tbree to four people and enter 
a design competition, culminating in a 
final jury in April. At that event, 
clients, Yale faculty members and 
outside critics gather to choose the 
winning project. In an effort intended 
to bind the students together, the 
whole class builds it for free during 
May. 

Brouard, a private contractor, is the 
Critic in Architectural Construction on 
the Yale faculty. He comes in expressly 
to oversee the building project. In his


Making purlina: "Thc:y (:all thia archilorturc." 
15 years at Yale , he has supervised 
hundreds of students but stresses that 
each develops an individual approach 
to architecture and building. Leaning 
against the shoreline embankment, he 
speaks readily and laughs often. "I am 
here and available to keep everything 
moving," he explains. "They learn 
from the mistakes that they make, 
from something that they have to take 
out if it doesn't work visually or 
structurally. They have to pull it apart 
and redo it, and when you have that 
experience several times, you are 
much more careful about how you 
approach it in another situation." 

A light shines on the seventh floor of the 
r:Uzrlcened Art and Architecture building on a 
night in mid-June. Stveral students are 
meeting after worlc. The SNET telepole truck 
finished excavation only the week before, 
drilling sixty-two holes 
in a roughly 
rectangular lot in the park in preparation for 
the concrete pilings that will support the 
bandshell's deck. Now the site looks like a 
giant gopher colony, a neat mound of earth 
piled next to each hole. 

In the studio, the lights illuminate only a 
small work area; the rest of the desks stand 
clean and abandoned until September. Four 
students bend their heads over drafting 
boards, brainstorming a required wheelchair 
ramp for the deck- one of the matry unforeseen 
elements that needs last-minute designing. 

The fish was an imaginative idea, and 
a tricky design. Originally conceived 
by four students as an elongated, 
marine animal form, it took its in-
spiration directly from the coastal site. 
Asked what architectural issues his 
design team considered, Ron God-
fredson shrugs. "We bought a lobster 
shell and looked at it to see how the 
pieces fit together. It was always sitting 
on the design table." Calling their 
scheme "a complicated organism," 
team captain Darin Cook explains that 
last-minute creative and technical 
breakthroughs rarely allowed them to 
finish drawings and models in time for 
the design deadlines. Recalling one 
presentation before the Yale faculty, he 
holds an imaginary model in his 
fingers and grins. "We would have this 
thing that was falling apart and it was 
like, 'Try to imagine a roof on this. We 
haven't figured it out yet but we're 
almost there.' And they're just looking 
at us like, 'You've got to be kidding.'" 

Still conceptual and unbuildable, 
their project was chosen as one of three 
finalists, 
and 
the problems com-
pounded. The team grew from four to 
twelve, gaining members from eli-
minated groups. Students divided up 
responsibilities such as budget, 
engineering and drawing requirements 
to 
prepare 
for the final 
review. 
Everyone had a say in the design 
refinements, which consolidated the 
shape of the polygonal deck and arched 
trusses and saw the addition of a 
copper-shi~gled roof. Going into the 
final jury, the model looked like a scaly 
insect or crustacean, its shell-like back 
perched on twelve spindly legs. 

Unlike its more traditional compe-
titors, whose forms remained more 
static during the design process, the 
amorphous fish could evolve in re-
sponse to the many client demands. 
Midway through the design period, the 
city, which commissioned the project 
for the Bridgeport Symphony, decided 
to allow the much larger New York 
Philharmonic to play there on its 
annual summer tour. The project size 
doubled, complicating the engineering 
requirements and creating new needs, 
such as heavy construction equipment. 
Its initial cost of S60,000 soared to well 
over SlOO,OOO, 
necessitating rene-
gotiation between the city

writer. 

As more information came in about 
the necessary size, acoustics, and 
engineering requirements, the form 
stretched accordingly. Darin Cook 
coordinated the group's efforts. 'just 
on the shape, we built nine models. 
We had three guys that would build 
something and show it to the group 
and we'd all sit there and say, 'No, I 
think it should_ .be tall~r, or longer, or 
iatter or skinnier,' and they'd go back 
and make a fat one, a skinny one, a 
long one, and one that combined all 
of them and crank out four more 
models for us to crit." 

Five uninterrupted days and nights 
of redesign and reengineering ended 
on April 22, the day of the final jury. 
The three design teams presented their 
projects to a panel of representatives of 
the 
Yale faculty, 
Bridgeport 
Symphony and mayor's office, Cilv-
trust Bank, and various acoustical, 
engineering and building code 
consultants. 
During the ensuing 
debate, the fish group nudged out the 
two 
less 
flexible 
design teams,
