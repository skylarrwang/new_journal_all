descriptively dubbed the "piano" and 
"tent" groups. Herbert Newman, a 
New Haven architect and the Yale 
faculty coordinator of the building 
project, 
recalls the jury: "It was 
exciting because it had a certain 
organic quality. It had the quality of a 
crab crawling out of the sea, of a boat 
turned upside down. It had all of this 
metaphorical imagery that at the same 
time worked as a bandshell. It seemed 
very appropriate on a shore, at the 
edge of the water. It was unself-
conscious. That is a very mature thing 
for students at an early age." 

The fish won almost unanimous 
support among jurors. The major part 
of the studio work over, the students 
and Brouard geared up to go into the 
field during May, planning to com-
plete the band shell by June 1 . They 
lacked only a building permit and the 
cursory governmental approvals. The 
next day, April 23, the L'Ambiance 
Plaza building under construction in 
Bridgeport collapsed, 
killing 
28 
workers and Yale's chances of 
starting on time. The tragedy's two-
week rescue effort and the subsequent 
lawsuits virtually shut down the city 
Building Department and put the 
students' project in jeopardy. 

Concrete 
now fills 
the gopher holes, 
supporting heavy joists and unfinished 
decking. Standing on top, you can see the blue 
expanse of the Sound over the embankment, 
marked by the black mass of an anchored oil 
tanker and the sharp white wedges of 
sailboats. A blue sedan pulls up and parks on 
the road on top of the embankment, joining 
the other shapes on the horizon. The driver 
watches the students working in the steamy 
June heat. Kneeling on the green pressure-
treated lumber, they strain to drive galvanized 
nails through the deck. Over on the steps, the 
water cooler is nearly empty. 

The driver lingers but does not get out of 
the car. His door bears the municipal seal of 
Bridgeport and gold stencilled Letters spelling 
"Building Dept. "' Several minutes later, he . 
restarts the engine and drives off toward the 
park entrance. 

The municipal cns1s caused by the 
L'Ambiance collapse brought the 
bandshell project to a grinding halt and 
severely altered its nature. Even when 
the immediate 
rescue operations 
ended, many bureaucratic hurdles 
remained. The Bridgeport Building 
Department, saddled by intense legal 
and media scrutiny, demanded that 
Yale meet many more requirements 
than customary to begin construction. 

The model looked 
like a scaly insect or 
crustacean, its shell-
like back perched on 
twelve spindly legs. 

The Coastal Area Planning Com-
mission forced some design changes to 
ensure that the structure will withstand 
the largest hurricanes to come off the 
Sound. Sturdy pressure-treated 
lumber replaced fine Douglas fir on the 
deck. According to joseph Grabarz, 
assistant to Bridgeport Mayor Thomas 
W. Bucci, the Building Department 
became "oversensitive to any proposal 
that came before them, and that helped 
to slow the process up a lot." Daily 
visits by nervous building inspectors 
eventually subs ided, 
but an 
overabundance of s:,ommitments in the 
mayor's office (it is an election year for 
Bucci) caused further delays. 

It was June 8 before the building 
project could begin again, a full six 
weeks behind schedule. Delays caused 
cost overruns and a manpower short-
age, since many students left New 
Haven for the summer, convinced that 
the project was defunct. Bridgeport 
offered to build the bandshell with city 
employees but the remaining students 
refused, valuing the education of the 
building process more; than simply 
achieving the 
final 
result. 

They 
compromised. The city employed the 
students at' eight dollars per hour and 
insured them with workman's compen-

sation. 
Citytrust Bank, 
which 
IS 
funding the bandshell as a gift to 
Bridgeport for its 150th anniversary, 
hired AI Hermandorfer, a private 
consultant, to coordinate the flow of 
money, 
supplies and information 
between the bank, 
the city, 
the 
Symphony, Brouard and the contrac-
tors who donated supplies and tools to 
the project. 

Still, 
only 
10 to 
12 
students 
were able to s1t out the delays to begin 
construction. The loss of two-thirds of 
the class to summer commitments 
compromised the binding nature of the 
project. "It's hard to call this a class 
project anymore." Paul Brouard sits up 
and rests a forearm on his knee. "I've 
always felt that the building project 
helped the class on other levels than 
learning building. It also makes them 
change their opinions of one another. 
The skills that are important in the 
studio are not always the ones in?--
portant in the field. Some of those 
people who have the field skills gain a 
lot of respect among their peers. It 
• does change the social and professional 
order of the class." 

Mary Beth's trusses are going up, and the site 
looks like a barn-raising party. The back four 
stand secure, and a fifth dangles above the 
~u 

deck from a crane. Supported onry by taut 
canvas straps, the truss quivers Like paper in 
the wind. Two workers steady it at the ends 
and wait to lower and bolt it to the concrete 
piers. A man in a Red Sox cap gives coaching 
signals to the crane operator, who rotates and 
dips the boom, nestling the truss footings onto 
the threaded rods. 

One peg is crooked and needs ar.fjustment. 
Bob Tucker climbs onto the pier, plants his 
work boots for balance, and hammers away 
with a sledge. The peg is embedded in 
concrete, and his rjfort yields onry a slow 
rhythm of.flat clicks. Beyond the construction 
fence, people stop to watch the progress. An 
old man matches the scene against this 
morning's paper, which carries a quarter-
page photo of the project. 

"With the birthday celebration and 
projects like this, we're trying to 
change the image of Bridgeport and 
the feeling among Bridgeporters about 
their own city. And they see it not just 
in a poster or billboard or new media 
event, they see it in something that's 
actually going up that they can look at 
and say, "Gee, that looks like some-
thing that would be fun to use." Joe 
Grabarz believes the building project 
goes a 
long way in overcoming 
Bridgeport's negative image. "The 
bandshell has become a focus for a lot 
of the positive feeling about the city. 
This could be something that the city 
could get excited about, help its 
development, and enjoy through the 
future." 

' 
Concern with the social effect of the 
building project has 
fluctuated 
throughout its history. Strong belief in 
the moral commitment of architects to 
.. It had the quality of a crab cr01wling ou t of the sea."
