EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
men as imperceptive, self-centered, 
and power-obsessed. While the women 
heal and protect, the men destroy. 
Women rely on intuition; men depend 
more on facts. The men educated in 
the West and those from the Middle 
East treat women in the same way. Al-
Benir and Turek, even Wolff, regard 
Beth as a "vessel" with one purpose- to 
perpetuate a male-dominated line. The 
presence of David, Beth's modern but 
frequently obtuse husband, does little 
to balance this portrayal. 

As the novel zips along, occasion~ 
potholes in the plot cause some:Â· 
discom fort. At the beginning, Polan 
refers to Aliza as both the "eldest" and 
"only" daughter of a sheik. Later, when 
'-< David readily supports Beth's decision 
to undergo in-vitro fertilization, the 
reader wonders what happened to the 
"rational" 
man 
who "considered 
decisions long and carefully." Did he 
get caught up in a feminine wave of 
emotion? The ending is jolting also. 
Polan 
hammers in her symbolic 
representation of the 
differences 
between men and women. Amidst the 
oversymbolism and melodrama, the 
ending dissolves into a farce. StiJI, the 
last pages also demonstrate her talent 
for making medical descriptions com-
pelling. The birth scene, detailed in 19 
pages, is one of the most tense and 
climactic of the book. 

Polan as interpreter allows the 
'"' reader to see into a world that, 
otherwise, would be incomprehensibly 
laden with professional jargon. In 
Second Seed, she imbues the scenes with 
an insider's familiarity. Through Beth 
We can observe the operations from the 
doctor's viewpoint: 
Beth took the knife and opened the 
incision at both ends, hoping the case 
would not get too complicated. After 
enlarging the incision, Beth put her 
hand in and delivered a d istended, 
discolored appendix dripping with 
infection. Working carefully to avoid 
spilling the green pus all over the 
abdomen, 
t hey 
removed the 
appendix and dropped the tied-off 
stump back into the wound ... Her 
hands worked automatically, tying 
and cutting as her mind wandered. 
I hope that tube works afln the inftction 
cleo.rs up, she thought. Otherwise we'll 
wind up with a blocked tube and she may 
never get pregnant. Sad for a twenty-two-
year-old. 

Earlier , Beth realizes that she must 
make a strong first impression on Dr. 
Wolff because brilliant doctors are 
frequently very busy and capricious. 
And Beth makes a quick plug for the 
doctors who make us suffer in the 
waiting room: "She forced herself to sit 
still and not ask the receptionist why 
Dr. Wolff wasn't there yet: she knew 
how much Sarah disliked patients who 
couldn't understand about emergencies 
or schedule changes, and she knew 
from her own experience that it was 
impossible for a doctor always to be on 
time." After reading this book we feel 
that we understand 
the medical 
profession and its practitioners better. 

In Second Seed, Polan has succeeded 
in creating an exciting and unique, if 
implausible, 
novel. 
And she 
has 
reduced the professional jargon to a 
digestible substance. At another level, 
the novel raises questions about the 
potential of technology and the persons 
who control this power. Luckily for 
this thriller, Polan has left the answers 
to a more staid book.
