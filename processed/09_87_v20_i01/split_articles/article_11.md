Chef Joacph Veroneai in hi• kitchen: 
"I t'll be a nice addition to our recipe 
file in the chicken line." 
by item . Stringer places orders for 
produce as he needs it, for meat two-
and-a-half weeks in advance. H e checks 
his records to see how a dish fared the 
last time arou nd. He allows for the 
time of year: "You know, people tradi-
tiona lly start eating heavier in the fall. 
The freshmen come through and grab 
one of everything. After two or three 
weeks, they reaJize that their eyes are a 
lot bigger than their stomachs." He 
takes into account the trends toward 
fish, 
poultry and pasta. 
And he 
gu esses. 


Stringer soundeJ cautious about 
ch icken basquaise. He tasted it toward 
the end of August during a week of 
ma nagers' orientation and found it 
good but not remarkable, very similar 
to chicken cacciatore, another of the 39 
ch icken dishes in Yale's repertoire. He 
thinks that it may bafne students. "You 
know, chicken basquaise- what the 
heck is that? I know Basque-southern 
Fra nce, northern Spain- but that still 
doesn't mean anything to me. So I 
notice the tomatoes, other things like 
that." Despite his doubts. Stringer is 
gambling that those "other things" will 
make the chicken dish Commons' top 
seller on September 15. "I think it's 
going to be the best out of the three. 
It's an attractive-looking dish. And it 
was tasty." 

Stringer ran down the menu for that 
evening. With 1600 portions to allo-
cate, he estimated that 800 students 
would choose chicken, 500 would 
choose pasta, and 300 would opt for 
shrimp. "You want poundages?" He 
dropped a tiny calculator onto the desk 
in front of him and began punching the 
buttons. "You're probably talking 
about 475 pounds of chicken." We're 
also talking about 250 pounds of 
potatoes, 
7 5 pounds of rice, 150 
pounds of broccoli, 75 pounds of 
apples, 100 pounds of lettuce, and 150 
dozen fudge cookies. 
"We're involved now 
with cube steaks. 
We've got 4000 of 
them." 
"OK, poundages." In his cramped 
office in the Stiles-Morse kitchen, Ed 
H oma reached for his own recipe box 
and calculator. Having tasted chicken 
basquaise during orientation, 
he 
seemed to have great faith in it. "I love 
chicken," he explained. On September 
15, he expects 525 eaters, which means 
he needs to have 7 52 portions pre-
pared: 352 of the chicken and 200 each 
of pasta and shrimp. He already has 
many of the ingredients on hand as 
part of his standard inventory. "We're 
pretty well stocked right now," he said, 
opening the door to a storage room full 
of neatly piled packages. "It's all 
alphabetized." In the back stood nine 
six-gallon cans of peeled tomatoes, 
which will soon be crushed by hand 
and turned into chicken sauce. But a 
few ingredients for chicken basquaise 
were not in evidence. In Homa's office, 
clipboards with labels like "Processed 
Vegetables" and "Meat Orders" cover 
one wall. These clipboards bear the 
forms that Homa- and all the other 
dining hall managers- will send to 
Don Mitchell. 

Don Mitchell bought 75,000 loaves 
of bread last year. He bought 14,000 
dozen hamburger rolls. He spent 
$80,000 on orange and apple juice. He 
is Yale's buyer. From his office on the 
second floor of the Yale Commissary 
on Long Wharf, Mitchell solicits bids 
each year from the vendors of items 
that appear on the menu. If he ap-
proves of the quality of their product, 
he contracts with ' the lowest bidder. 
Once orders arrive from the managers, 
he compiles them and sends them 
along to the vendors, who deliver 
either direct to the dining halls or to 
the Commissary. Eric Uscinski re-
called that a vendor once sent 1000 
pounds of asparagus, all the wrong 
size. "Don had them come and take it 
away and bring us back the right 
kind." 

All meat comes through the Com-
missary, which boasts its own butcher 
shop. "We're involved now with cube 
steaks," Mitchell reported. "We've got 
4000 of them. They've got to be cut by 
hand 
and 
then 
tenderized 
in 
a 
machine- twice." 

Downstairs, visitors must don white 
coats before entering the "cutting 
room." According 
to 
Mary Ann 
Bernick, 
Mitchell's assistant, 
the 
cutting room's temperature remains 
between 40 and 50 degrees throughout 
the day. Large, shiny hooks dangle 
near the entrance, and a steel track 
runs around the ceiling. "We hang 
leg of lamb from that," she explained. 
The room was silent and almost empty. 
At the back, a man stood over a small 
manual grinder at the end of a long 
table, turning 19 70-pound boxes of 
eye of rounds into cube steaks. In the 
recesses of the Commissary lurk two 
huge freezers, both the size of WLH 
classrooms. Both maintain stock at 20 
degrees below zero. In the corner 'of 
one freezer stood 500 boxes, each 
containing six-and-a-half pounds of 
breaded clam strips. Could those all be 
for one meal? "Oh no, no," Bernick 
said with a smile. "Almost two." The 
chicken for the basquaise will arrive at 
Long Wharf precut, from Delaware or 
Maryland. Mitchell will send it along 
to the kitchens in Yale's trucks the 
night before it is needed. T here will be 
a lot of it, but the cooks don't seem 
worried.
