Lost in Thought 
Some homeowners place clear plastic 
over their furniture in the belief that 
this makes the upholstery's beauty 
more enduring. They step back, ad-
miring their handiwork, delighted that 
they have added something functional 
and attractive. In a similar fashion, 
Yale students, assuming that the ad-
dition of their observations helps all 
ideas make a lasting impression, tend 
to place a transparent layer of intellec-
tual artificiality over anything they 
think about. There lies a certain 
danger in thinking too much and ex-
periencing too little. 


Plastic over fabric is just fine, if you 
are content to have your living room 
sofa serve merely as a conversation 
piece. If, however, you have any in-
terest in actually experiencing your 
sofa- if you actually sit down on 
it- and you happen to be wearing 
shorts, your thighs soon get all sweaty 
and stick to the plastic and make moist, 
offensive squishing noises whenever 
you shift your weight. The thin syn- · 
thetic substance you have placed bet-
ween 
yourself and your sofa, 
something which was meant to in-
crease your appreciation of an object, 
has in fact distanced you from that ob-
ject. Yale trains your mind to do that 
to the world. 


The primary skill emphasized in the 
Yale education - close analysis of an 
object or idea- simply cannot be ap-
plied successfully to all aspects of life 
outside of an academic setting. In 
situations which require just the op-
posite sort of skill, the ability to react 
flexibly 
or spontaneously, 
the 
possessor of an overly-trained mind 
may have trouble adapting. One Yale 
student I know, continually ensures 
himself of romantic failure by insisting 
on discussing with any would-be love 
interest the repercussions of a potential 
first kiss, as per.tains to (a)Where this 
kiss will lead; (b )How appropriate this 
kiss may be considered, given the time 
elapsed; and (c) What degree of respect 
each kisser will command vis-a-vis the 
other 
kisser 
with the 
successful 
co nsummation of said kiss. 


I suspect that every Yale student 
knows a number of people like this. 
Such a person thinks too well and 
thereby finds a problem for every solu-
tion. T he preponderance of this mind-
set on the Yale campus helps to explain 
why student publications tirelessly run 
articles dealing with the age-old theme: 
"Why there is no sex at Yale." 


The Yale social fabric is an awkward 
thing with big, floppy lapels and small 
buttons which constrict one's breathing 
when fastened. For many of us, it 
seems to find its way out of dead 
storage only twice a year- for the 
Christmas and Spring balls-and not 
even alterations by Rosey's cleaners 
can get the old thing to fit. Students 
must look elsewhere for Yale's strong 
suit. With an assortment of 55 dif-
ferent libraries in all sizes, shapes and 
colors, the Yale undergraduate can 
always be stressed to kill. 


The 
only 
campus 
locale 
approximating a 
student 
center, 
however, is Machine City, a sterile 
underground conglomeration of fluor-
escent lights and white formica 
scrunched between two huge libraries. 
This location is strikingly appropriate, 
because no matter where on campus a 
Yale student may emerge, he usually 
appears to be "between libraries"- as if 
he would really feel more comfortable 
scrutinizing a document in the stacks 
than carrying on an unstructured 
conversation. 


Many 
Yale 
students share the 
nagging need to dig too far, to pull an 
idea apart ruthlessly until· it lies 
sprawled out on the dissecting tray 
bearing no resemblance to what it 
started out as. Once you have spent a 
few years at Yale, the tendency to over-
analyze everything follows you relent-
lessly, no matter how far from New 
Haven you wander: you can run, but 
you cannot hide. Last summer, as I 
worked on a construction site, this 
unshakeable 
tendency 
tracked 
me 
down. 


I had decided to get involved in 
construction in order to exercise my 
body and give my brain a partial rest 
from the strains of academia. I did not 
abandon my academic interest in li-
terary analysis entirely- I read nearly 
every night when I wasn't too tired 
from work- but my greatest pleasure 
derived unquestionably from the novel 
experience of working with my hands. 


During my first weeks on the job, I 
learned how to shingle the walls and 
roof of a beach house. At first I found 
myself concentrating too intensely on 
the task, with the result that I often 
drove nails in crooked or split shingles 
in half. After a while, however, I 
learned to let my mind relax. I did my 
thinking at home. At work I let my 
body take over, and before long I could 
align shingles effortlessly and get a 
smooth rhythm going, sinking one nail 
after another without giving it a 
thought. 


The only ground rule I established 
for myself was that I must always leave 
my book at home when I went to work 
in the morning. Physical exertion and 
mental exertion · were equally im-

portant to me; each had its separate 
place in 
my day, and neither 
encroached upon the other. Then one 
sweaty August afternoon, something 
happened which threatened to disturb 
the serene order of my summer. As my 
fellow laborer and I unloaded a pack of 
cedar roofing shingles, a tiny blue-and-
white leaflet appeared from within the 
pile, fluttered momentarily in the 
breeze, then settled gently on the laces 
of my left work boot. 


"FREE LITERATURE," the leaflet 
announced. I was intrigued. I knelt 
slowly to pick up the slip of paper, 
which informed me that "information 
on 
use and 
application of 
certigrade 
shingles 
is 
to 
be found in colorful and descriptive 
literature available from: Red Cedar 
Shingle and Handsplit Shake Bureau." 


As a literature major, I could not 
with good conscience pass up the 
opportunity to examine a new form of 
literature. But here was a curiosity I 
should never have indulged. I should 
have known not to try to weave 
together the two halves of my day. I 
should have remained satisfied to lead 
a double life-a construction worker 
by day, a Deconstruction worker by 
night. 


That very evening, however, I sent 
off for my free literature, and when it 
finally arrived at my door, I was quite 
impressed with its quality. The shingle 
entitled Timeless Beauty: Red 
Cedar Shingles and Handsplit Shakes, 
seemed unusually well written for a 
piece of advertising. In fact, one 
especially poetic portion of the catalog 
stuck in my head. 


Red cedar. An enduring wood. 
Richly textured. Strong. 
Natural. A wood to touch. And be 
touched by. 


These lines reminded me of a famous 
stanza written 
by the 
nineteenth 
century poet George Pope Morris: 


Woodman, spare that tree! 
Touch not a single bough! 
In youth it sheltered me, 
And I'll protect it now. 


The catalog's repetition of the key 
word "touch," as well as the recurring 
man/wood motif, seemed almost an 
intentional allusion to the Morris 
poem, but of course this was only a 
shingle catalog I had before me, so I 
shrugged off this notion of intertextual 
reference and went to bed. 


At work the next day, the catalog 
repeatedly entered my thoughts. Even 
while I 
nailed rows of shingles, 
recollections of the surprisingly fine 
writing of Timeless Beauty distracted me 
from my task. Just before quitting 
time, a painful splinter of red cedar 
penetrated my right index finger 
underneath the nail. 


Returning home, 
I 
postponed 
removal of the splinter and headed 
straight for my copy of Timeless Beauty. 
As I flipped through its pages, I ran 
across a provocative passage which 
appeared to parallel the climactic scene 
of James Joyce's Ulysses: 


It makes sense to have family friends 
next door. Another good friend to 
have around: red cedar fancy-butt 
shingles. "They put a happy yet 
superbly functional face on any 
hideaway. 


Few will deny that Joyce's Molly 
Bloom has a "fancy butt," and in the 
final section of Ulysses, Molly takes 
exception to the way her husband 
Leopold frequently puts his "happy yet 
superbly functional face" upon this 
fancy butt of hers: "living with him so 
cold never embracing me except 
sometimes when hes asleep the wrong 
end of me . . . any man thatd kiss c. 
womans bottom Id throw my hat at 
him." 


The subtle stylization of Timeless 
Beauty's prose so craftily duplicated 
Joyce that my esteem of the catalog 
grew enormously. Perhaps, I thought, 
the earlier allusion to the Morris poem 
had not been my imagination. My 
interest in Timeless Beauty intensified, 
but I still remained somewhat skeptical 
about its literary value. 


By the following morning, however, 
my skepticism was rapidly dimini-
shing. All during work I simply could 
not get my mind off Timeless Beauty and 
its very special way with words. When 
I examined my work at the end of the

day, I discovered that I had nailed an 
entire wall of shingles slightly askew. 


That night, I read a stanza of lovely 
shingle poetry which convinced me 
that Timeless Beauty, in its pivotal scene, 
assures us of its quality, advising 
prospective critics that it would be pure 
folly to deny the Red Cedar Shingle 
and Handsplit Shake Bureau's claim as 
a literary power in its own right: 


"Unscheduled inspections, conducted 
by expert shingle and shake 
'patrolmen,' virtually guarantee that 
these products will be the highest grade 
attainable." 


"I am my own critic,"Timeless Beauty 
seemed to say, "so don't waste your 
breath." 


So maybe I have been too critical, I 
thought. I went back to the catalog and 
perused the text for deeper meaning, 
stopping short at the theatrical words: 


"Carefree vacations require carefree 
vacation homes. Enter red cedar." 


Here I immediately recognized the 
drama and poetic 
resonance of 
Shakespeare's immortal line from Act 
I, Scene ii of The Tempest: "Enter 
Ferdinand." Although Timeless Beauty 
does not hesitate to borrow some of the 
dramatic energy of Shakespeare, I 
concluded, 
the dynamic 
shingle 
novella demonstrates that the addition 
of red cedar shingles makes it more 
durable than anything Shakespeare 
ever wrote. Shakespeare could not 
survive The Tempest; it was his last play 
and he never wrote anything again. 
Timeless Beauty, 
however, 
has the 
literary strength to endure a tempest, 
and any other storm for that matter, 
because "even in 
harsh coastal 
environments, red cedar and handsplit 
shakes retain their beauty . . . and 
they'll withstand hurricane-force 
winds." 


I was well pleased with my critical 
analysis. If I 
could discover an 
emerging literary force behind those 
thinly split, oddly shaped scraps of 
wood, 
thought, 
then 
would 
understand red cedar shingles better 
each time I picked one up and nailed it 
onto a house. My superior education 
could not fail to make me the most
