result. Two years ago, insurance 
companies refused even to insure 
midwives, and only after the American 
College of Nurse-Midwives began to 
consider sel f- i nsurance did 
a 
consortium of companies agree to 
provide coverage. Doctors who hire 
midwives usually pay their insurance 
costs as well; when coupled with their 
own insurance bills, the price of hiring 
.~ a midwife often rises too high. Several 
New Haven-based practices which 
used to employ midwives no longer do 
so, citing excessive costs. 


Marshall Holley does not believe 
them. "I don't think the insurance part 
is the reason most doctors don't use 
midwives," he says. "I thi~k the doctor 
ego, where he would have to relinquish 
control, is the main reason." The most 
common arena of confrontation is the 
hospital: when a woman's attending 
physician is unavailable at the time of 
her delivery, a resident must sub-
stitute. 
Unfamiliar 
with nurse-
midwifery techniques and schooled in 
interventive medicine, these residents 
are "always prowling the halls, sticking

their heads in everybody's rooms," 
Andrews says. "Their purpose is to 
deal with high-risk situations, and they 
tend to turn everything into a high-risk 
situation." In fact, statistics show that 
nurse-midwives are much less likely to 
be sued for malpractice than are OB-
GYN physicians. About 67 percent of 
physicians will encounter malpractice 
suits during their OB-GYN careers, 
compared with about six percent of 
nurse-midwives. Even accounting for 
the fact that midwives handle only 
"normal" pregnancies, this comparison 
does not support a conclusion that 
midwives are in any way less capable 
than physicians of providing labor and 
delivery care. 


"When I was a student at Yale, the 
relationship between the midwives and 
the residents was horrible. Horrible," 
Wittreich says. But she has exper-
ienced the kind of crisis that makes 
hospitals like Yale require a physician 
to be present at deliveries: one of her 
"normal" deliveries suddenly turned 
life-threatening when the baby suffered 
a shoulder dystolcia, in which the

child's head is sucked back into the 
mother and goes into respiratory 
failure. ~The baby was turning blue. 
All of a sudden I heard this voice 
behind me saying, 'Need any help?' 
And it was like, 'God, yes!' That kind 
of situation doesn't happen often, but it 
can give you gray hairs and chest 
pains. An extra pair of hands is always 
nice." 


Doctors who do employ midwives, 
usually at salaries of around $30,000, 
compensate for 
their 
diminished 
authority with the freedom from being 
constantly on-call. In Wittreich's 
practice, the CNMs handle 95 percent 
of the approximately 500 deliveries 
that are done yearly. This can mean a 


60 to 70 hour work week, with none of 
the financial rewards physicians can 
expect. "You're not going to reco~p 
your investment like you would if you 
were a doctor," Wittreich says. "The 
hours are brutal. But," she adds softly, 
"there's nothing like delivering a baby. 
It's still a big thrill for me. I think you 
should hang up your gloves if it gets 
boring for you." 


Helen Burst, the chairperson of the 
Maternal-Newborn Nursing/Nurse-
Midwifery Program at the nursing 
school, has seen a lot of women, and a 
few men, express this sentiment. She 
graduated from the nurse-midwifery 
program in 1963, and has since written 
the standard 
textbook on nurse-
midwifery in addition to performing 
her administrative duties. When other 
CNMs speak of her, they show the 
kind of deference usually reserved for 
doctors. "Have you met Helen yet?" 
one of them asks. "She's ... well, she's 
pretty imposing." In person, Burst 
seems less awe-inspiring than her P.R. 
would suggest. She laughs frequently 
and loudly, jumping up to find a 
reference to midwifery in the Bible. 
"Here it is, right here. Genesis, 35:17. 
The midwife's first words were, 'Fear 
not.' Isn't that great?" 


Burst has found many reasons for 
enthusiasm in her 24 years of nurse-
midwifery experience. "When I first 
gradu~ted," she says, "there were only 
three or four places where one could 
practice as a midwife. New York City, 
out in Santa Fe, ip Baltimore, and in 
Kentucky. Now, we've got jurisdiction 
in all fifty states." The Connecticut 
legislature enacted a statute governing 
nurse-midwives in 1981. Before that, 
according to Wittreich, midwives 
could not sign birth certificates after 
they had performed deliveries. "A taxi 
driver-if a woman gave birth in the 
back of his cab, he could sign the birth 
certificate. But midwives couldn't. 
There was no way for us to prove the 
work we were doing, no record of any 
of it." 


Gradually, 
the 
medical 
establishment seems to be accepting 
the presence of nurse-midwives in 
hospital births. Community Health 
Care Plan (CHCP), New Haven's 
health maintenance organization, 
employs six CNMs who each handle as 
many as 40 patients a day. But few 
doctors will support midwifery care in 
what is perhaps its purest form, the 
home birth. CNMs cannot participate 
in home births without losing their 
Yale-New Haven admitting privileges, 
but independent, or "lay," midwives 
can and do. Independent midwives, 
who need no special certification or 
training, number about 3000 in the 
United States. They generally 
populate rural areas more than urban 
centers like the Northeast, but 
Connecticut does have four such 
women, and two of them are in 
practice together outside of 
N~w 
Haven.
