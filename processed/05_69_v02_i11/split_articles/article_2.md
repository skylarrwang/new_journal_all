**Title: When Buckminster Fuller looks at the world, he sees the universe.**
**Author: Lawrence Lasker**

There wasn't much fanfare when Buck-
minster Fuller came to Yale last February. 
In fact, if you weren't paying close atten-
tion to the posters tacked up around the 
campus, it would have been quite easy not 
to know that he came at all. He gave one 
public, four-hour rap in the Law School 
Auditorium in the afternoon and then 
seemed to disappear along with his ideas. 
Where he took them, though, was down 
the street to the Art and Architecture 
Building to begin a series of classes that 
would leave a few students mildly bored, 
would afford others with some good things 
to think about and, for the few who were 
ready to really get into what Fuller was 
saying, would change their lives. 

"I am giving you the way I think as best 
as I know how," Fuller told the gathered 
architects, city planners and graphic de-
signers that first night. "These are the most 
prominent thoughts I have in my head, 
and I am really hoping you wiJl take these 
away from me and think about them and 
do something with them. But I don't think 
about any of these things as school work 
or credits or exercises. This is life, this is 
it, and we are living on the frontier. It's 
terribly exciting, because you gradually 
find that you are right, and you are seeing 
for the first time that man is beginning 
to realize what he is doing here in the uni-
verse, what his function is on this space-
ship, Earth .... " 

I first became interested in Buckminster 
Fuller three weeks ago. A friend, who was 
visiting Yale after leaving last September 
to try life in the East Village, had left an 
old hard-backed book by my bed, Fuller's 
1938 Nine Chains to the Moon, and I 
glanced at it before going to sleep. I had 
not heard him speak, and all I knew of 
Fuller was he had designed the geodesic 
dome. I first thought the book was a 
eulogy to technology, complete with fold-
out time lines showing the onward march 
of progress, and done with a rather pec-
uliar sense of world mission. I wanted to 
dismiss the book for its ignorance of the 
coming products of technology, but I 
remembered hearing rumours about some 
far-out game Fuller was planning at the 
A&A Building. I decided to ask someone 
who had gone to the classes what was 
going on. 

Fuller had been asked to come to Yale 
by Herbert Matter, a New York designer 
who wanted to make a movie about Fuller 
and his ideas. Matter visited him at his 
geodesic dome home in Carbondale, where 
Fuller is head of Southern Illinois Uni-
versity's World Resources Inventory. The 
two men decided to work with Matter's 
design students at Yale on the problem of 
visually communicating the ideas behind 
what should turn out to be Fuller's great-
est project, a natural outgrowth of the 
work he has been doing for most of his 
seventy-three years: The World Game. 

"I guess the best way to understand the 
World Game is to try to get into how 
Fuller thinks," Wayne Creekmore told 
me sitting at his desk in the basement of 
the A&A. Creekmore, a third-year design 
student, has committed himself to help 
figure out how to get Fuller's ideas across 
in visual terms. If he weren't "forced by 
society to make money to exist," he would 
devote all of his time to the problem, 
which he thinks is the most important 
work to be done in life. 

Now Fuller's thought-style is really 
pretty basic, which does not necessarily 
mean that it is widely known. He learned 
early in his life that, to trust the wisdom 
of his elders was to insure inaccurate

thought. (Partly because of this attitude, 
he was thrown out of Harvard twice.) "By 
now," he says, "I've spent a lot of my life 
just trying to unlearn ways that my reflexes 
have been conditioned to respond. It's 
hard, because it takes more than just in-
tellectually realizing what is right." What 
Fuller tries to do is "ask myself the largest 
questions I can think of asking, and then 
answer them without any preconceived 
ideas of politics or economics, but in terms 
of my own experience. And I find that if 
man does not think in terms of the total 
universe, he is likely to leave out some 
very important concepts." 

Take Fuller's example of Einstein's 
discoveries (somewhat simplified). When 
Einstein looked out at the universe and 
saw one star as a live show taking place 
thirty thousand years ago and another as a 
live show taking place eighteen hundred 
years ago, he intuitively felt that the con-
cept of an "instant," simultaneous uni-
verse was wrong. Instead, be postulated 
that the universe was "an aggregate of 
non-simultaneous, only partially over-
lapping transformations of events." Then 
maybe, he thought, the universe is not 
running down as so many men believe; 
and this led to the discovery of the real 
conservation of energy. Energy is not des-
troyed or lost; it just goes somewhere else. 

"But I find," Fuller told the design 
students, "that society is so tremendously 
specialized that there has been almost no 
philosophizing in this country, no integrat-
ing the significance of the different in-
formation coming in. For instance, be-
cause of the cosmological concept of the 
universe running down, as I came into the 
intellectual wocld of Harvard, this concept 
meant that our resources are going to 
diminish, that they get spent. Spending is 
a very powerful word in politics, the idea 
of running down. But there has been no 
revision of economics chapters because of 
the discovery of the real conservation of 
energy .... There was almost a philosophic 
premise that socialism wouldn't work 
because there wouldn't be enough to 
go around for everybody. But there is 
enough, now, for all of mankind." 

Reading Fuller is a little like reading 
optimistic science fiction, but when one 
considers that there are people dying 
every day of starvation and overcrowding, 
his ideas have overwhelming appeal. "Life 
tends to behave very well if it has the right 
environment," he has said. "Our job is 
to try to see how we can organize the world 
so man can be free to enjoy his total 
earth. The World Game is the way I began 
to see we might get there in a little more 
hurry than any other way." The Game is 
to be played on a computerized map of the 
world, and for forty years Fuller and his 
team have been compiling a vast inven-
tory of resources and human trends to 
feed into the computers. Experts in dif-
ferent fields from all over the world will 
travel to Carbondale to play the final 
game. (This summer students from col-
leges throughout America will play the 
Game for the first time, on a limited 
scale, working with Fuller at the Studio 
School in New York.) 

Fuller bas already come up with some 
pretty amazing proposals for man. After 
looking at energy sources, he bas 
suggested that man use income energy-
water, wind and direct sun power-rather 
than depletive (and pollutive) energy 
sources like oil and coal. There is, he 
says, more energy in one hurricane than 
in the combined atomic stockpiles of 
Russia and the US. One proposal he has
