I have read with considerable interest the 
column by Jonathan Lear on the Yale 
Daily News and the article by Paul Gold-
berger on Lawrence Paros and the Sum-
mer High School in your April 27 issue. 
In view of your magazine's well deserved 
reputation for sound and reliable re-
porting, I find the articles and the pos-
sible results of their being taken seriously 
very disturbing. Speaking entirely as an 
individual, and not for the News or Mr. 
Paros, I would, therefore, I ike to respond 
to your contentions. 

According to Mr. Goldberger, "The 
combination of YSHS's financial woes and 
its educational crisis was the real reason 
for Yale's decision to discharge Paros." 
To prove Mr. Paros's alleged financial in-
competence, Mr. Goldberger cites nobody. 
To prove his thesis of an "educational 
crisis," he relies on the alleged views of 
three teachers in the Summer High School. 
According to Mr. Lear, "three months" 
of research went into Mr. Goldberger's 
article. It seems to me that if in this time 
Mr. Goldberger could find no more sub-
stantiated evidence to support his charges 
than the views of those three teachers and 
his own intuition, The New Journal owes 
Mr. Paros an apology for printing those 
assertions. 

In analyzing the educational crisis, Mr. 
Goldberger cites only three teachers; he 
also never explains what his criteria for 
evaluation are. By the traditional criteria 
of college admissions Mr. ParQs was 
more sucessful than his predecessor, Joel 
Fleishman, now Associate Provost for 
Urban Affairs. Of course, the whole point 
of Mr. Paros's program was to question 
traditional criteria, but this does not entitle 
Mr. Goldberger to develop his own un-
named ones. Certainly, he should have 
looked to educational authorites, both 
within and outside the program, and to a 
broader sampling of teachers and students. 
If he had, he would have found that the 
vast majority of Summer High School 
students, faculty and observers support 
Mr. Paros's work. 

There are thirty-seven former students 
and faculty of the Summer High Â§chool 
in the New Haven area, twelve at Yale. Yet 
Mr. Goldberger is only able-to quote four, 
one of whom, Mr. Frank, has informed 
me that he has been quoted out of context 
without his permission, and that the 
quotation used does not reflect his opinion 
of the program. Mr. Hildebidle and Mr. 
Ciochetto, Mr. Goldberger's other two 
references, were Mr. Paros's most vehe-
ment critics within the program; the 
criticisms of Mr. Hildebidle are contained 
in a document he himself terms a per-
sonal polemic. The vast majority of 
students and faculty to whom I have 
spoken and whose letters to Mr. Paros I 
have read praise Mr. Paros's work. It 
seems to me that Mr. Goldberger has an 
obligation to consider their views with 
more than just a short quotation from 
one girl. 

Only two outside observers spent any 
length of time at the Summer High School 
-Edgar Friedenberg, one of the nation's 
leading educational theorists and a man 
whose praise of YSHS you quoted several 
issues ago, and Edgar Beckham, of 
Wesleyan University. After several days 
of intensive interviews and analysis, these 
men had high praise for both the con-
ceptualization and the management of the 
program. Mr. Friedenberg has called the 
1968 Summer High School "the hope for 
America." Mr. Beckham has praise for 
not only the theoretical design of the 
program, as Mr. Goldberger noted, but 
also for its management, which Mr. Gold-
berger did not note and which runs 
counter to his argument. He wrote: 
The thing that struck me most about the Yale 
Summer High School was the thoughtfulness 
and depth of the theoretical design .... The 
inteUectual implications of the core course 
had been worked out in great detail, and even 
the behavior of students had been anticipated, 
interpreted, and worked into a conceptual 
framework. In short, I thought the program 
was extremely well conceived. [end of Tile 
New Journal quote] 

It seemed to me that the social problems 
which confronted the program were handled 
skillfully. You [Mr. Paros] had quite a volatile 
mix of students on your hands, but their en-
ergies were channeled productively. 1 was 
also impressed by the effect of the shift in the 
recruitment procedures. It was clear that the 
Upward Bound kids, who were new to the 
program, were more aggressively bright and 
displayed more inteUectual energy than the 
students who were returning to YSHS fot a 
second summer. 

Even if Mr. Goldberger feels that Mr. 
Paros could not deal, in academics and 
in discipline, with the type of alienated 
student recruited for the program, and 
perhaps that the Summer High School 
shouldn't have tried to do so, it seems to 
me that he has an obligation to note that 
the only two outside professional edu-
cators who examined the program sup-
port Mr. Paros on both counts. Instead, 
he ignores Mr. Friedenberg's views com-
pletely and includes only those aspects of 
Mr. Beckham's opinions which do not run 
counter to his argument. Nor does Mr. 
Goldberger ever consider the views of 
Dr. Lawrence Gould and Dr. Edward 
Klein, the Summer High School's research 
consultants, who have evaluated the pro-
gram since its inception. 

Mr. Goldberger uses a quotation from 
Mr. Ciochetto to imply that Jonathan 
Hall tricked certain faculty members into 
signing a statement endorsing Mr. Paros. 
Whether or not the statement endorses 
Mr. Paros personally is open to question; 
my own reading is that it only asks for an 
explanation of Mr. Paros's dismissal and 
criticizes the style of thinking reflected in 
the Singer Report. In either case, however, 
it is irrefutable that Mr. Hall read the full 
statement to Mr. Ciochetto before he 
signed it. If Mr. Ciochetto now believes 
that the statement constitutes a personal 
endorsement of Mr. Paros, it is only be-
cause he now interprets the statement 
differently than he did when he signed it, 
not because he was tricked. Mr. Gold-
berger writes: 
Traditionally, the anthology [of faculty 
evaluations) is distributed to the Administra-
tive Board of the Summer High School and 
becomes an important factor in the review 
of the year; this time, however, Paros with-
held copies of the critical report. Members of 
the Board and staff writers of the Yale Daily 
News, who thought they were getting the 
"full story" were never even made aware 
of its existence. 

In point of fact, the anthology is prepared 
for internal staff use and has never before 
been distributed for general use or given 
to the Board. But my own experience is 
that Mr. Paros is quite willing to let any-
one sec it once they understand its nature. 
Mr. Goldberger himself was offered a 
copy. Contrary to what he reports, I too 
was aware of it and have read it. 

The anthology is "critical," but not in 
the negative sense Mr. Goldberger im-
plies. The anthology is designed to assist 
the staff in the planning for the following 
year; understandably, those who have no 
criticisms are less likely to write evalu-
tions. One-third did not last year. Those 
who did wrote evaluations which I would 
describe as "mixed"-not too surprising 
considering the experimental nature of the 
program. But the views expressed in the 
anthology right after the summer do not 
necessarily constitute views held perma-
nently. Teacher Jim Elston recently wrote 
Mr. Paros: 
During the summer I felt that I had a fairly 
good understanding of what was going on. 
Recent reflections and insight have shown 
me that I was merely at one level of under-
standing and there are many above it of 
which I was unaware. 

With this in mind I cannot understand 
how Mr. Goldberger, knowing the nature 
of the anthology, could base his entire 
opinion of the program on the views of 
Mr. Paros's two most vehement critics as 
expressed in that anthology. Certainly he 
has an obligation to consider the views of 
Mr. Friedenberg, Mr. Beckham and the 
majority of the Summer High School 
students and faculty who support Mr. 
Paros's work. 

Mr. Goldberger's financial analysis 
appears to be based largely on a memo-
randum prepared by Jonathan Fanton, 
University Consultant for Special Educa-
tion Programs. Nowhere does he quote or 
consider the views of Francis Nicoll, 
Dir.ector of the Office of Gifts and Grants, 
who keeps the Summer High School 
books. Of course, he also does not quote 
Mr. Fanton. Having compared the YSHS 
budget with Mr. Fanton's memorandum, 
I can well understand why Mr. Fanton 
did not allow himself to be quoted-his 
memorandum, blaming the YSHS deficit 
on Mr. Paros, is a total distortion of the 
true facts of the matter. At the very least, 
Mr. Fleishman, who was responsible for 
supervising and approving Mr. Paros's 
budget as his immediate superior, shares 
joint responsibility for any mismanage-
ment. It should be noted that Mr. Fleish-
man never made clear what Mr. Paros's 
fund-raising responsibilities were and 
never questioned his budget. Mr. Paros 
understandably modeled his budget on 
Mr. Fleishman's for the previous year; 
the Comptroller's Office statements which 
Mr. Paros allegedly didn't read revealed 
that overhead charges, half by design and 
half through a clerical error in the Office 
of Gifts and Grants, were waived on that 
budget, and accordingly Mr. Paros waived 
overhead charges on his. Mr. Paros's 
budget, with no overhead charges, went
