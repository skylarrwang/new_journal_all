Paul Goldberger replies: 
I am grateful for Mr. Hallett's careful 
reading of my article. I am sorry, however, 
that he seems unable to answer without 
resorting to the same biases, unsupported 
assertions and outright misstatements of 
~act that have characterized his reporting 
m the Yale Daily News. 
First, the purpose of my article was 
only to prove that there is a reasonable 
doubt about the success of the 1968 pro-
gram. I feel this doubt is sufficient to 
have justified Mr. Paros's dismissal. Mr. 
Hallett only barely concedes that it exists. 
I feel compelled to clear up several 
particularly blatant errors contained in 
Mr. Hallett's letter before I state my own 
position further. First, his statement that, 
"By the traditional criteria of college 
admissions, Mr. Paros was more success-
ful than his predecessor, Joel Fleishman" 
is false. Ninety-nine per cent of the Su~Â­
mer H igh School students from Mr. 
Fleishman's years (1965-66) were ad-
mitted to college. T he Students in the 
Yale Summer High School last summer 
have not all reached their senior year of 
high school, and have not yet begun to 
make applications to college. Therefore, 
no final figures even exist for Mr. Paros's 
years; Mr. Hallett seems to demonstrate 
remarkable powers of clairvoyance in 
asserting that Mr. Paros's "record" is 
higher. And moreover, students for Mr. 
Paros's first year (1967) were selected by 
Mr. Fleishman before Mr. Paros assumed 
his d ~ ties and therefore do not represent 
the kmd of student Mr. Paros states his 
program existed to deal with. 
I question Mr. H allett's assertion that 
"the vast majority" of students and faculty 
s~pport Mr. Paros's work. True, many 
d1d-but my article mentions this. As an 
attempt to give the other side of the story-
to explain this "reasonable doubt"-J nat-
urally turned toward critics, none of 
whose comments had ever found their 
way to what Mr. H allett calls the "un-
biased" pages of the News. Indeed, if 
Mr. Hallett had access to these comments, 
as he claims he did, why did he never 
choose to print any? The administration's 
~efusa l to talk, which I join Mr. Hallett 
m deploring, does not absolve him of any 
responsibility to investigate the other side. 
The News's decision to ignore the other 
point of view based on the administration's 
~a-comment stance is not only unfair; it 
IS a cheap and easy way of evading the 
newspaperman's responsibility to print 
both sides of the story. 
Mr. Hallett's assertion that Jonathan 
Hall read the faculty statement to Peter 
Ciochetto is another untruth. Given the 
level of conduct of Mr. HaJJ and Mr. Paros 
during the course of the controversy, I 
must say I am willing to reject their word 
in favor of that of Mr. Ciochetto, who 
again says that the statement was never 
read to him, but instead paraphrased 
wrongly, in order to gain rights to his 
signature. Mr. Ciochetto had never before 
heard the statement the News printed 
until I read it to him over the telephone. 
Mr. Hallett's comment that the an-
thology of faculty comments has "never 
before been given to the Board" is another 
untruth. Mr. Fleishman made a regular 
practice of reviewing it with the Admin-
istrative Board during his tenure. And it 
is easy to say that "Mr. Paros was quite 
willing to let anyone see it once they 
understood its nature," for very few 
people did understand its nature-how 
could they if they were never even told 
of its existence? 
Mr. Hallett's attempt to explain the 
financial problem, rather than put that 
issue to rest, opens a Pandora's box of 
erroneous assertions. It is true that Mr. 
Fleishman, as Mr. Paros's superior, shares 
responsibility. But the actual errors them-
selves remain the fault of Mr. Paros. 
First, it is hard to believe that "Mr. 
Paros understandably modelled his budget 
on Mr. Fleishman's for the previous year," 
for Mr. Fleishman's included overhead 
charges, that elusive item Mr. Paros seems 
to have forgotten. Mr. Hallett further 
states that "Mr. Paros's budget, with no 
overhead charges, went through to Wash-
ington with the necessary approval." 
Again he is in error. My checks with the 
Office of Economic Opportunity in Wash-
ington have revealed that $21 ,812 in 
overhead charges was included in the 
I 968 budget, an amount added by the 
University before the budget went on to 
Washington. Mr. Paros would be wise to 
keep a closer eye on his budgets-just be-
cause he forgot overhead does not give 
him the right to charge that the university 
accounting offices made the same mistake. 
I find its curious, though, that Mr. Paros 
forgets to include overhead costs when he 
prepares his own budget yet remembers 
them quickly when they can be used in 
his defense. It is true that the university 
Comptroller's Office erred and neglected 
to account for eleven thousand dollars . 
in overhead on the 1966-67 OEO grant 
for the Summer High School. But this 
error was in Mr. Paros's favor and, con-
trary to his claims, the University admits 
its error and has not sought to reclaim the 
eleven thousand dollars. But since the 
sum must be made up out of university 
contingency funds, it is included in the 
overall Summer High School deficit-i.e., 
the overall amount of money the Univer-
sity will have to supply to rebalance the 
Summer High School accounts. But no 
one charges Mr. Paros with responsibility 
for the eleven thousand dollars. And 
moreover, the Provost has authorized 
that twelve thousand dollars overhead be 
waived on another OEO grant to reduce 
the level of the deficit for which Mr. Paros 
is responsibile. Why has Mr. H allett not 
mentioned this? 
The figure of only six thousand dollars 
in additional expenses for the twenty-eight 
extra students in the program is highly 
questionable. While half of the students 
did bring five hundred dollars, this hardly 
offsets the estimated cost of fifteen hun-
dred dol1ars per student, which totals 
forty-two thousand dollars, quite a cut 
above the six-thousand figure. And if, as 
Mr. Paros states, no new teachers were 
necessary for twenty-eight students, it 
appears as though the Summer High 
School was overstaffed in the first place or, 
worse, that the program was watered 
down to accommodate the extra students. 
But most important, there is no truth 
whatsoever in Mr. Hallett's statement that 
Mr. Fleishman approved the increase in 
number of students. Mr. Fleishman was 
never even questioned about the increase; 
Mr. Paros simply accepted the extra stu-
dents without authorization. (I find it in-
teresting to note that Mr. Paros himself 
never claimed Mr. Fleishman's approval 
on this matter. Again, Mr. Hallett's zeal 
has driven him to distort facts to an even 
greater extent than Mr. Paros has.) 
The Director's Report, which Mr. Hal-
lett maintains costs less than a previous 
one written by Mr. Fleishman, may well 
have been less expensive to print. But 
Mr. Fleishman's document of approxim-
ately one hundred pages took nowhere 
near the amount of staff time to prepare 
that Mr. Paros's of almost four hundred 
pages did. And it was not a personal 
defense or a long statement of personal 
educational philosophy, as was Mr. 
Paros's Report. It was what it was sup-
posed to be, a summary of the summer. 
True, the 1968 staff was not permitted 
to join in planning for the 1969 session. 
But they were retained to run a follow-up 
program for last summer's students. It is 
impossible to believe that the follow-up 
program did not suffer because of the time 
diverted to the writing of that voluminous 
report. 
Mr. Hallett errs again when he states 
that he was present at every meeting be-
tween Mr. Paros and me. This is absolute-
ly untrue. How does he know when I am 
with Mr. Paros? Mr. Hallet's clairvoyant 
abilities seem to have failed him here, 
for he is unaware of several talks I had . 
privately with Mr. Paros. And I am sorry 
to have to repeat again that Mr. Paros did 
in fact demand editing rights to my story; 
indeed, he and his two associates subjected 
me to continual harassment and went as 
far as to urge at one point that the entire 
story be eliminated "because it would only 
add to tensions." 
The rationale Mr. Paros, Mr. Hall and 
Mr. Miller used to justify their demand is 
a strange one in light of their oft-repeated 
concern for free dialogue. Mr. Hall ex-
plained to me that, in the free and 
open university they foresee, the press 
would }lave to work closely with news 
sources such as themselves reviewing 
finished stories before publication so as 
to be sure they approved of the impression 
that was to be conveyed to the public. 
Perhaps Mr. Hall calls his version of co-
operation a license for a free press; I prefer 
to call it control of the news, something 
hardly consistent with the "open uni-
versity." 
Another error lies in Mr. Hallett's de-
scription of relations between Mr. Paros 
and the Administrative Board. Mr. Paros 
did in fact refuse to attend not one but 
two Administrative Board meetings called 
to discuss his dismissal. He did not attend 
one because, as Mr. Hallett reports, he 
wished only to be there if Mr. Fleishman 
could attend. He refused to attend another, 
however, simply because that day be con-
sidered himself emotionally unable to go 
through the experience of discussing his 
dismissal. This is most unfortunate, but 
it does not give him the right to say he was 
denied the chance to state his case. 
Indeed, the second time Mr. Paros re-
fused to come, the Board directed its 
chairman, Richard Sewall, to request Mr. 
Paros to write a statement explaining his 
position. The Board has yet to receive the 
statement. 
Finally, I take strong exception to Mr. 
Hallett's view of the role the Yale Daily 
News has played. The statement that the 
News's coverage has not been biased is 
nothing short of extraordinary. Nowhere 
in any News story relating to the con-
troversy have I been able to find any state-
ment whatsoever that is unfavorable to 
Mr. Paros. True, the administration bas 
refused comment, but, as I stated above, 
that in no way means there is no other 
view to be investigated. Mr. Hallett claims 
he had access to the critical faculty an-
thology. Then. why were readers led to 
believe the faculty had aligned itself en-
tirely in Mr. Paros) favor? The anthology 
contains several essays opposing Mr. 
Paros's management o( the Summer High 
School, not simply the two I quoted. 
(Perhaps Mr. Hallett simply failed to read 
the anthology carefully-a possibility en-
hanced by the fact that he reports John 
Hildebidle termed his essay a personal 
polemic against Mr. Paros. A more care-
ful reading would inform Mr. Hallett that 
Mr. Hildebidle did not term his essay a 
personal polemic but only expressed fears 
that it might be taken as such by careless 
readers. It was in fact the most serious, 
conscientious and eloquent statement in 
the entire anthology.) 
Mr. HaJlett's piece de resistance is his 
claim that his coverage did not include 
personal attacks. If calling Richard Sewall 
a coward is not a personal attack, I call 
upon him to tell me what is. 
As to Mr. Hallett's discussion of his 
alleged collusjon with Mr. Paros. I find 
it rather lacking in evidence to disprove 
my charge. I am happy that fate shines on 
Mr. Hallett so brightly that he chanced 
to meet Mr. Paros on York Street at just 
the very moment he needed him, right 
after he had discussed my article with a 
New Journal copyreader, acting without 
authorization. Even if that meeting was 
just a coincidence, why was Mr. Hallett 
present on Aprill8 when Mr. Paros, Mr. 
Hall and Mr. Miller called me to their 
office to attempt to have the article 
changed? There is certainly no reason for 
an outside member of the press to have 
been at that meeting, and the way the 
afternoon turned out-Mr. Paros, Mr. 
Hall, Mr. Miller and Mr. Hallett all to-
gether defending the Summer High School 
and demanding changes in the story-
makes it difficult indeed to believe that 
Mr. Hallett was the unbiased reporter he 
claims he was. For at least those two and 
one half hours on April 18, Mr. HaJlett 
was not a reporter at all; he was another 
arm of the staff of the Yale Summer H igJl 
School. 
Mr. Hallett notes that "the meeting de-
generated because of understandably high 
emotions." I hasten to point out that, 
although I was the target of all four gentle-
men for the entire afternoon, the meeting 
did not degenerate because of my emo-
tions. It was Mr. Paros who, upon being 
challenged as to the ethics of preparing a 
four-hundred-page report in his defense, 
found it necessary to resort to name-call-
ing. H e then left abruptly and the meeting 
ended. 
Mr. Hallett claims that "a far better 
case could me made for collusion between 
Mr. Goldberger and Mr. Fleishman and 
Mr. Fanton." This, too, is an absolute 
untruth, and I suspect Mr. Hallett knows 
it, for he offers not a single word of sup-
porting evidence. 
The length required simply to correct 
Mr. Hallett's misstatement of fact is, I be-
lieve, an ample index to the strength of 
his argument. There remains no question 
in my mind that the Yale Summer High 
School was a flawed program. While its 
basic conception was excellent and well 
thought out, its execution left a great .deal 
to be desired. 
Administratively, the program was 
troubled not only by financial problems 
but by very serious discipline problems. 
Many sources reported the absence of Mr. 
Paros and of then Associate Director Paul 
Jefferson at times of crisis. One of last 
summer's students, now in Yale's Transi-
tional Year Program, emphasized that the 
basic concept of the program was valu-
able enough to make it a "great" summer, 
but added: "Larry Paros never asserted 
his authority. He let the kids run all over 
him. He never told it straight; he was a 
very bad administrator." Twenty-one of 
the thirty teachers whose evaluations are 
included in the anthology cite the adminis-
tt:ation's overly weak line on discipline. 
While Edgar Beckham may have liked the 
program's romantic attitude, I am more 
willing to trust the opinions of the faculty 
members who had to deal with the prob-
lems themselves. (By the way, Mr. :aeck-
ham and Edgar Friedenbreg were not, as 
Mr. Hallett stated, the only leading edu-
cators to visit YSHS. David Riesman 
visited also, and came away with a par-
ticularly unfavorable impression.) 
The program, then, was a failure ad-
ministratively. Nor was it a rousing suc-
cess academically. While students by and 
large did enjoy the program, any com-
petent educator would agree that the 
evaluations they prepared at summer's end 
for the Director's Report are hardly a 
valid means of making a final judgment on 
the program. As another former student 
told me, "Most of the kids were the type 
who would enjoy any program that gave 
them freedom." 
I made the point in my article that the 
good core concept was perhaps not ideal 
for the disadvantaged students Mr. Paros 
insisted upon having. It seems as though 
Mr. Paros agrees, for in the latest version 
of his Director's Report he admits that 
many problems resulted "from the fact 
that the Yale Summer High School was 
only a summer program," and that the 
"alienated" students he enrolled could 
not be dealt with in a summer. By this 
admission, Mr. Paros is in fact conceding 
the academic failure of his program. He 
claims the University lacked a "commit-
ment to solve the problems we addressed." 
But this is just the point: the problems Mr. 
Paros "addressed" were not the problems 
he was charged with addressing. The Sum-
mer High School was never designed to 
serve "problem" students, but rather those 
with college potential, because the Univer-
sity has known all along what Mr. Paros 
has just found out: simply, that alienated 
students cannot be dealt with in a summer. 
Thus the formation of the Summer High 
School as a program for underprivileged 
but "college-material" students, and the 
establishment of different programs, such 
as Upward Bound, for less promising 
students. 
J doubt that I will ever be able to con-
vince Mr. Hallett of the fallacy of charging 
Mr. Paros's dismissal to the Singer Report. 
We all agree that the Singer Report was 
not the real reason for the dismissal 
(though the other administration reason, 
the OEO requirement for a faculty direc-
tor, is indeed quite real), and I share Mr. 
Hallet's disapproval of the administra-
tion's refusal to discuss the full story. Yet 
I still maintain that it was a desire to pre-
serve Mr. Paros's reputation that resulted 
in the withholding of the information I 
presented. Furthermore, the Yale adminis-
tration, as would any institution in power, 
selfishly wanted to keep the issue quiet. I 
agree that this was an unwise policy. But 
let us not allow it to obscure the larger 
fact: that Lawrence Paros was a poor ad-
ministrator. 
!.recognize that my story was a one-
sided presentation; perhaps our error was 
really in the billing of it as the "fuli story." 
Yet it is the responsibility of a newspaper 
such as the News to provide the real full 
story, and it was Mr. Hallett's failure to do 
so that prompted my investigation into the 
other side of the controversy. I apologize 
for any errors I may have made (and par-
ticularly to Michael Frank, whom I did 
indeed quote without permission). But in 
the final review of the evidence, I see no 
reason whatsoever to change my conclu-
sions. I believe Lawrence Paros was 
wrong, and that Mr. Hallett, in what may 
indeed have beeq an honest and well-
meaning effort to defend him, abdicated 
the high standards of journalistic integrity 
traditionally associated with the Yale 
Daily News.
