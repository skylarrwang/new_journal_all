When Ed Logue looks at 
the world, he sees buildings. 
by Susan Braudy 
Jane Jacobs, the author and urban critic, 
says she knew Ed Logue was a bad fellow 
when he confided to her that another fire 
would be the best thing that could happen 
to San Francisco. It would allow them to 
plan things, he explained. Logue likes to 
plan things. As head of Nelson Rocke-
feller's New York State Urban Develop-
ment Corporation (SUDC) since last April, 
he can condemn and build anything, any-
where in New York State, even against the 
wishes of local mayors and their communi-
ties. Today, Edward J. Logue is without 
question the most powerful urban renewal 
director in the country. 

When Logue started lecturing at Yale 
Law School years ago, students crowded 
the wainscotted classroom to pay homage 
to a glamorous, super-tough, super-suc-
cessful Yale Law graduate. Ed Logue's 
brains and drive had gathered enormous 
worldly power in the name of liberal ideas, 
a formula the awed students memorized 
eagerly. He had changed the faces of two 
American cities, New Haven in the 1950's 
and Boston in the early 1960's, bringing 
down buildings almost as easily as a subur-
ban gardener weeds crabgrass from his 
front lawn. Logue used New Haven as his 
renewal laboratory. He changed the dying 
heart of a dirty milltown into a thriving 
business district. Like Lewis Carroll"s red 
queen, Logue has stayed in that one place, 
New Haven, though he bas travelled from 
city to city in the past sixteen years. His 
New Haven formula: hire a bright, young, 
highly-paid staff, finagle millions from 
the "feds" (federal government), seduce 
businessmen to invest in the downtown 
business district, build roads to bring Mrs. 
Suburban-Shopper into town, relocate 
slum dwellers and, most important, make 
sure Ed Logue calls every shot. 

In the old days Logue always finished 
his Saturday morning lectures at Yale in 
time to get to the Yale Bowl for a home 
game. But the last time he lectured at Yale 
angry students made him late for the kick-
off, battling with him over what they felt 
was his inattention to the needs of the poor 
black people whose ghetto homes he had 
bulldozed or rehabilitated to make way for 
upper and middle income housing, high-
ways, office buildings and department 
stores. While others had theorized, he had 
acted, and in the process he became re-
sponsible for many of the sins and achieve-

Times Magazine. 
ments of urban renewal. 

Logue first wiped away New Raven's 
ugliest slum, Oak Street, with bulldozers. 
Residents fled to the city's other slums, to 
nearby West Haven and to Bridgeport. 
The old Oak Street ghetto now contains a 
super-highway that empties suburbanites 
into the new downtown shopping center, 
several luxury highrise apartment build-
ings and office buildings. Today Logue the 
politician admits to one mistake in New 
Haven. "I should have kept design control 
over the buildings in Oak Street," he says. 
"In my ignorance, I thought I could rely 
on the Southern New England Telephone 
Company to choose good architecture." 

New Haven was Logue's working mod-
el. Previously planners designed almost 
solely for professional citations, then 
shelved their work and their awards. 
Logue built buildings. But slum dwellers 
never fared as well as the suburban shop-
per, who never came back to live in New 
Haven, but station-wagonned in every day 
to shop at the new Macy's. Over twenty-
two hundred lower-income New Haveners 
have been moved and removed, some of 
them three and four times. Logue's coali-
tion for urban renewal didn't include one 
minority, the poor and the propertyless. 
"You have to hurt somebody in this busi-
ness," says a former Logue aide. "So you 
hurt those who can't hurt the program." 

Logue's defenders say it was a question 
of taking inadequate steps or doing noth-
ing in New Haven. But there were still 
slums in New Haven, new slums and old 
ones. Then came the riots in the summer 
of 1967. Was there trouble in paradise? 
National attention focused fleetingly on 
New Raven's problems instead of her 
buildings. Today New Haven redevelop-
ment plans are blocked by angry citizens 
who say they resent being treated as pawns 
in the paternalistic game of !-know-what's-
best-for-you. After years of being manipu-
lated, fear and mistrust are the ghetto 
dweller's reaction to redevelopment. Citi-
zen opposition is stronger here than in any 
other city. 

Logue met opposition with anger, logic 
and forcefulness. He had a way of shutting 
out arguments, recalls an aide. If you dis-
agreed with him, you were bad. He stayed 
up nights memorizing federal urban re-
newal regulations and proved his genius 
for getting money from the "feds." Today, 
New Haven has received $930 per capita 
from the federal government, more than 
any other city and more than twice as 
much as New York. 

These days, Logue is almost impossible 
to catch up with to interview. He spends 
his days criss-crossing New York State: 
by plane and train for a businessman's 
luncheon in Buffalo, to Albany for a con-
ference with Rockefeller and a speech to 
a synagogue fellowship, then back to his 
New York City office. Weekends he shut-
tles from New York to his Beacon Hill 
home in Boston where his family is mak-
ing plans to move to New York. 

After settling his briefcase and my coat 
on a crowded commuter train to New 
Haven where he is going for a farniiJ din-
ner at his mother-in-law's home, I...Oaue 
flatly denies students' charges agail\st him. 
"Lookit, I'm not a bad fellow." He speaks 
quickly with nasal vowels which are a 
combination of Philadelphia and Yale. 
He's put on a little weight since the old 
New Haven days; his blue eyes are still 
black fringed but a little tired; his hair is 
graying. He looks like an elderly, fatter, 
Ivy-League version of Glenn Ford. 

''I'm not a bad fellow. Urban renewal 
wouldn't be around this long if it meant 
pushing people out in the streets. There 
aren't any villains in this business. I never 
go into a community unless I am invited." 
"By the property owners?" I ask. 
"No," he purses his lips and makes an 
angry noise. Our train is passing through 
Harlem, and tenement lights flicker across 
his angry face and his Shetland jacket as 
he stares out the window. He's an incur-
able building watcher. "Some people say 
if neighborhood people come to me, they 
must be Uncle Toms or bourgeois. But 
I'm invited into neighborhoods by minis-
ters, schoolteachers, factory workers-a 
good cross section." 

Last spring Governor Rockefeller, then 
the urban presidential candidate, declared 
that New York State must take some 
responsibility for the plight of the cities. 
He twisted a few arms with several late-
night phone calls to get SUDC legislation 
through a hostile state assembly on the 
night of Dr. Martin Luther King's funeral, 
even though the legislation had been de-
feated earlier. Said Rocky proudly a few 
weeks later at a news conference announc-
ing Logue's appointment, "I chose Edward 
Logue to direct urban development be-
cause Logue gets things done." 

Logue's New York State appropriation 
is seventeen million. One year from now 
he will issue one billion dollars in bonds. 
which Rockefeller predicts will generate 
five billion more in private investment and 
federal grants, a total of six billion for 
building purposes. Previously, renewal 
chiefs applied for federal funds, con-
demned buildings, then sold land to private 
developers who would finance construe-

tion. Now Logue can do this and more. 
He can act as the state government or as 
a private developer. He is being paid fifty 
thousand dollars a year to carry urban 
renewal, if he wants to, from start to finish. 
To cities all over New York State he offers 
savvy, power and relief from years of 
struggling with red tape and unfinished 
projects. 

While the New Haven-bound train 
lurches into the Fairfield County night, 
I ask Logue about his overwhelming pow-
er. As a consultant while SUDC legislation 
was being prepared, Logue insisted that a 
program-head have the power to override 
local protests. I ask him why he wanted 
this power. Does it say, I'm the boss; deal 
with me or else? The question makes him 
shift angrily forward, and the springs 
squeal in the worn velvet train seat. Then 
he slouches down into his jowls, the seat 
and his coat. Logue loves a fight. He looks 
like a governor or a senator;but his man-
ner is abrasive, boyish. 

"Why don't you repeat that question, 
stamping your foot and raising your fist 
for every place you've loaded it?" Logue 
throws me a fast appraising look and be-
gins to talk. "Cities aren't equipped to do 
the job. The 'feds' have their troubles too. 
People aren't gaining on city problems. 
I won't go anywhere without an invitation. 
I will go to City HaJJ and work with Mr. 
Mayor. I won't fight him. And right now 
we've lots of business in New York." He 
turns back to building-watching as we pass 
through Bridgeport. 

Mayor Lindsay has attacked Logue's 
program for its invading and encroaching 
on homerule. There are two theories about 
what will happen to Logue in New York 
City. Some say state-city harmony is a 
must; both sides want SUDC money spent 
here. Others predict a battle a month be-
tween Logue and Lindsay. 

New Towns are now the magic words 
around Logue's new Manhattan head-
quarters at 666 Fifth Avenue, where a 
black receptionist sits surrounded by car-
tons of roadmaps and blueprints. New 
Town traditionally has meartt a planned 
self-sufficient city built as a unit on a large 
tract of vacant land. This traditional New 
Town contains its own houses, factories, 
stores, parks and office buildings. New 
Towns in this country like Reston, Virginia 
and Columbia, Maryland are advertised by 
brochures that happily depict uniformly 
white-middle-class suburban families liv-
ing out the Readers' Digest version of the 
American dream. 

Logue's New Towns are still to be 
planned. They will be located inside exist-
ing towns like Utica and just outside places 
like Albany, Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo 
and Newburgh. But Logue's New Towns 
wouldn't be completely self-sufficient. 
Residents would depend on nearby or 
surrounding established towns for some 
jobs, schools and recreation. 

Says a planning critic, "We all turned 
up our noses at Levitt's instant communi-
ties ten years ago. But now Logue adds a 
tree-shaded factory, an office building or 
two, some token low-income housing, and 
he's got a fancy social experiment called 
the New Town." 

" New Towns are our goals for New 
York State," says Logue. "We will cre3te 
balanced communities, racially and eco-
nomically." 

What he doesn't say is that his New 
Town is substantially the same thing he's 
been building for years: predominantly 
upper and middle income houses, central 
business districts and token low-rent hous-
ing. 

Logue has added or perhaps subtracted 
one wrinkle in his formula. He will have 
fewer people problems with his New 
Towns because he is building them on 
vacant land. He won't have to relocate, 
build homes for, or plan with people al-
ready Jiving on the sites he's chosen. It's 
as though the area has already been bull-
dozed and the people scattered for him. 

A Logue fan, a former New Haven Re-
development aide says, "Though he isn't 
admitting it, maybe Ed's finally learned 
he's not a community person. He never 
used the energies of the ghetto or slum 
community anyway in the planning proc-
ess; not that any other efficient planner did 
either. Bob Moses, I suspect, cared a little 
more for cars than for people. One never 
stops hoping that Ed cares a little more 
for people than for buildings." 

But Logue has again run into people 
problems in a New Town called Fort 
Lincoln, for which he directed planning 
on an empty tract outside Washington, 
D.C. The project's neighbors-mostly 
black homeowners-are upset because they 
haven't been consulted about the first 
families Logue has decided to move in. 
These will be poor blacks and will com-
prise up to 10% of the total project popu-
lation. Neighbors fear the poorer residents 
will set the tone, and that the project won't 
attract middle-class whites and blacks. 

Jesse Jackson, head of the local citizens' 
planning council complained, "This will 
be another ghetto. I don't see how any 
sensible person could expect a fifty-fifty 
racial balance by any stretch of the imagi-
nation." 

Logue's father died when Logue was in 
his teens, and he worked his way through 
Yale waiting on tables. After graduation 
he flew seventeen missions as an Air Force 
bombardier in Italy. Critics cite his bom-
bardier days as his only training for the 
wholesale bulldozing and flattening of 
New Haven and Boston slums. 

After the war, Logue returned to Yale 
Law School, where he found time to 
unionize law school and hospitaJ employ-
ees for the United Mine Workers. He ad-
mired John L. Lewis as one man who 
knew how to use power. As the campus 
radical, Logue also married Margaret 
DeVane, the daughter of the Dean of 
Yale College. While Logue was organiz-
ing a hospital strike, his mother-in-law 
was a patient. She approved. 

After graduation in 1949, Logue 
worked in Philadelphia as a labor lawyer. 
"I quickly became dissatisfied," recalls 
Logue riding toward New Haven, "be· 
cause the real power decisions were made 
by elected labor leaders. The lawyers were 
just technicians." Obsession with the pow-
er of elected officials has been the Logue 
life theme. Today one of his favorite jokes 
concerns Tacky O'Dwyer, a political 
crony of Mayor Richard Lee, who ran 
New Raven's parking garage. Once 
O'Dwyer sent a pal to Lee for a patronage 
job. 

"Well," Lee asked, "what job do you 
want?" 
"I want Tacky's job," announced 
Tacky's pal. 
"Then what's left for Tacky?" won-
dered Lee. 

"Tacky's job" became Logue's code-
words for the coveted power of Logue·s 
bosses. When he ran for mayor of Boston 
in 1967, he was after Tacky's job. In 1966, 
while he was writing the report to Lindsay 
which recommended giving centralized 
planning powers, developing powers and 
budget powers to Edward Logue, aides 
asked, "What's left for Lindsay?" Logue 
laughed shortly, "You mean what's left 
for Tacky?" 

In 1953 Logue drifted back to New 
Haven, lured by his pregnant wife's liking 
for a local obstetrician. Logue had planned 
to practice law, but found himself instead 
working in the thick of Richard Lee's 
mayoral campaign. After Lee won, he 
called Logue into his office, pulled a copy 
of the city charter from a desk drawer 
and asked casually, "How about working 
for me? Take a look here and see if any-
thing appeals to you." 

Logue finally became Lee's official sec-
retary at six thousand dollars a year with 
backstage powers as deputy mayor. After 
one year, Logue was running the Rede-
velopment Agency. After two, he officially 
or unofficially ran all city agencies' activi-
ties that had anything to do with redevel-
opment-zoning, traffic, parks, and even 
schools. New Haven became the country's 
first model city, a m iracle of renewal in 
the urban desert. Awed bureaucrats from 
all over the country trooped dutifully and 
even enthusiastically to the shrine. 

Some of Logue's New Haven subordi-
nates felt his programs were more im-
portant to him than the people he worked 
with. "We fought continually, right until 
the time Logue left in 1961," Mayor Lee 
has said. Their fights were power struggles. 
Logue wanted Tacky's job. He aJso wanted 
the public trappings that went with his 
powerful number-two role. But Lee want-
ed to keep him under wraps. Says Logue, 
"I was ready to be a behind-the-scenes 
fella, but there was a difference between 
being a subordinate and a slave. Once 
Dick cut the ground out from under me in 
public. When he did that, I just got up 
and quit." 

Today Logue and Lee blissfully agree 
they fought like brothers. Indeed, Lee's 
adroitness at handling people made the 
two men for a time an almost perfect team. 
Logue and others attribute much of their 
success in New Haven to the chemistry 
between Logue and his boss. 

Logue is still a loyal Old Blue, who had 
the doors to his home on Beacon Hill and 
to his Boston Redevelopment office painted 
Yale blue. He attends all YaJe home games, 
and he joins thousands of fellow Yalies 
who have champagne on ice plus banquet 
at the Harvard game. "Tailgating," they 
call it, as they sit on folding chairs in 
raccoon coats, eating out of the backs of 
their Buick station wagons. 

But, while other Yalies visit Mary's or 
favorite teachers, Logue returns to Dick 
Lee's house for their traditional Thanks-
giving party. Here, with Logue squeezed 
next to him on the couch, Lee starts to 
tell anecdotes of the early urban renewal 
days. Soon Logue and Lee are topping 
each other's stories. The other graduates 
of Lee's urban renewal crash course listen 
nostaJgically. "It's like returning to Mecca 
every year," sighs one usually no-nonsense 
type. New Haven, despite riots and angry 
slum dwellers, is still their model, their 
Mecca, as it is Logue's. Only the wives are 
bored at these reunions. They daydream

and half-listen to this year's version of 
stories they've heard for the past ten years. 

In December, 1965, Logue came to New 
York to serve on Charles Abrams' housing 
task force for Mayor-elect Lindsay. Logue 
attended few meetings, but he did have 
time for a public confrontation with urban 
critic Jane Jacobs over lunch at the Har-
vard Club. Her book Death and Life of 
Great American Cities argued that neigh-
borhoods and people's homes should be 
preserved, not destroyed by renewers. To 
Logue partisans, she is a "soft-beaded-
slum-lover." She believes in community 
control of planning, to the extent of get-
ting herself arrested recently for leading 
a demonstration that resulted in her des-
truction of the stenographic record of a 
public hearing on the Lower Manhattan 
Expressway. 

On the train Logue looks only a little 
like the tired commuters around him star-
ing at folded newspapers as he describes 
his exchange with his favorite arch-enemy. 
"Jane came on very strong as usual, 
skidding over facts like suds. She was 
bitching as usual about urban renewal. She 
said we shouldn't even be talking about it. 
I finally said, lookit, Jane, you tell the 
Mayor and the rest of us what you'd like 
to see changed in your neighborhood. Or 
is it perfect the way it is? So she started 
listing planning with people, new schools, 
new low and middle income houses, re-
habilitation of existing homes and good 
social services. When she was all through, 
I sai~, Jane, we call that stuff urban re-
newal. I don't know what you call it, may-be you have some great new name. The 
Mayor then laughed like hell," remembers 
Logue shaking his head and slapping his 
armrest happily, "and we finished our 
lunch." 

Jane Jacobs might have responded that 
she differed with Logue on priorities. 
Logue, she would say, gives only token 
emphasis to community planning, re-
habilitation and social services. During 
that luncheon at the Harvard Club, she 
and a few others were horrified to hear 
Logue remark, "If you want to bulldoze a 
neighborhood, you can avoid community 
protest by enlarging the boundaries of 
your total renewal area. Then the bull-
dozed area will be a smaller part of the 
whole." 

Jane Jacobs had not seen the last of 
Edward Logue. Two months later she was 
to rush to an African C hurch in East 
Harlem, visions of bulldozers dancing in 
her head, for a panicky secret meeting. 
Mayor Lindsay had invited Logue to New 
York to write himself an urban renewal 
program and head it up. At the meeting 
Jane Jacobs worried about Lindsay's latest 
move with community control partisans 
like Herbert Gans, one of urban renewal's 
most sensitive and relentless critics. Gans, 
a Colombia professor and author of The 
Urban Villagers, has been dogging Logue's 
heels since the 50's. Gans, Jane Jacobs and 
others decided to commission Michael 
Appleby, a Ph.D. candidate in planning at 
Harvard, to write a report on Logue's 
Boston renewal work. 

"Appleby was a good choice," says 
Gans, a shy man whose office is tilled with 
yellowing Timeses, Lifes and Newswuks, 
and who mumbles, "because Appleby, 
though we didn't realize it, knew lots of 
people working with Logue in Boston." 

"Let Gans talk ideal solutions all he 
wants," says a poverty program executive, 
who also started in New Haven, as he 
chews his cigar. "Gans never met a payroll 
in his life. He never ran a program, never 
built a building." 

So while Logue and company compiled 
"Let There Be Commitment," Logue's 
report on New York's housing ills, 
Appleby compiled his report on Logue's 
Boston record. Appleby's is a scholarly 
document that carefully footnotes statistics 
for factual claims. Logue was tops in his 
field, summarized Gans' introduction, at 
building business booms and middle class 
housing. But New York needed low-
income housing badly. Could Logue adapt 
to the new situation? Could he relocate 
slum dwellers in their own repaired, not 
bulldozed neighborhood according to 
plans they've helped to make? Could he 
change his priorities? 

Logue and his New York staff met for 
the first time on a wintry night in January, 
1966. Logue had discovered that no city-
