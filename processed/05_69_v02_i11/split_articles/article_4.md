When Clement Markert looks 
at the world, he sees the people. 
by David Meter

When Clement Markert was twenty, he 
and his university roommate said goodbye 
to Colorado and went to fight the fascists 
in the Spanish Civil War. Exactly a year 
later Markert was back in classes, begin-
ning honors work in Biology. His room-
mate was dead, killed when the Abraham 
Lincoln Brigade was surrounded by 
Franco's troops and virtually annihilated. 
Markert had been one of a lucky few. 

Today Clement L. Markert is fifty-two 
and chairman of the Yale biology depart-
ment. Although he is not well known 
among Yale students, he has a national 
reputation as a statesman among scientists. 
He edits journals, chairs committees and 
lobbies before scientific advisors to the 
US government as a member of the Com-
mittee on Science and Public Policy of 
the prestigious National Academy of 
Sciences. His research on the chemistry 
of the isozyme LDH produced the last 
significant discoveries in the field of de-
velopmental biochemistry until just 
recently. 

Markert is a brusque man. Some, even 
some who know him best, caJI him a cold 
man. He is known as a scrupolously fair, 
blunt and decisive department chairman 
who does not like to share responsibility 
and powers with anyone else. Few people 
think of him as a radical anymore, and 
few people know about his rich radical 
history in the tradition of the Interna-
tional. His life is now apolitical outside of 
scientific circles, an inactivity which is 
belied by the strong words he still uses 
to describe his "outrage" at the crimes 
of the American capitalist system. A col-
league and close friend gently chides him 
for his refusal to reenter radical activity 
and for his failure to play a major role 
in the Day of Reflection on science, tech-
nology and the military held March 4 at 
Yale. 

Markert himself considers that be is a 
"fundamentally very radical individual" 
according to a rather broad definition: 
A radical is one who is not only willing but 
dares to question the fundamental nature of 
anything he encounters, and I do contin-
uously. I don't really think you can be a good 
scientist unless you're pretty radical. 

His prescription for American society 
sounds radical too: 

The nature of our society requires a funda-
mental transformation, an overturning if you 
wish. And that's true at this very moment. 
Unless we are able to solve the problems of 
being a militaristic, imperialistic society, that's 
likely to create a crisis. In fact the Vietnam 
War has about created such now. But the 
powers that are running the country are able 
to even manage with that kind of egregious 
affront to the country ... they can still man-
age. It's incredible that they can do so. I 
should have thought something like the Viet-
nam War would have had ninety per cent of 
the population in the street with guns, but 
obviously it doesn't. If most people felt like 
I do, they would be in the street with guns. 

And yet Markert is not ready any longer 
to lead people into the street, because he 
concludes we are not really in a revolu-
tionary situation and knows more effi-
cient and less futile uses for his talent. 

Markert's office in the Kline Biology 
Tower is small and nearly undecorated, 
walled with pale yellow concrete blocks 
which would belong more in a warehouse 
or rec room than in a beautifully propor-
tioned skyscraper. There Markert sat be-

hind his desk and talked freely, if dispas-
sionately, about his history as a radical, 
a soldier and a biologist. I munched jelly-
beans from a small beaker on the desktop 
(they were a demonstration gift from the 
company that made the beaker), and 
listened, occasionally asking a question. 

Clement Markert's adolescent years in 
Pueblo, Colorado coincided exactly with 
the lowest depths of the Depression. The 
general mood of discouragement among 
Colorado steelworkers led him "tore-
pudiate completely any support for the 
so-called free enterprise system under 
which we operate." His father was a 
foreman in the steel mills, and Clement 
as a teenager went to work in the mills 
and nearby farms during the summers. 
While on the job, he helped organize the 
steelworkers union, and after two years 
of organizing saw the union win its first 
election and begin to act as the workers' 
bargaining agent. 

I didn't try to communicate my more sociaJist 
feelings because understanding them required 
a level of sensitivity and sophistication which 
scarcely any of the workmen bad. Rather, I 
tried to point out their immediate interests as 
I saw them. The security of their jobs, the 
level of their pay, the kind of treatment they 
would receive from the company. Not at all 
did I try to recruit them on the basis that the 
capitalist system was no good. If anyone had 
tried to do that, he would have failed. 

"Interacting" with communists and so-
cialists around the University of Colorado, 
where he went in 1935, politicized Mar-
kert even further. He became the leading 
organizer of a communist student group 
affiliated with the Communist Party of 
Colorado. The rise of Hitler, the Italian 
invasion of Ethiopia and the Japanese 
push into China provoked a reaction 
against fascism which bad a further effect 
on student-radical Markert. The Spanish 
war broke out in 1936: 

By the time I was a junior, the Spanish Civil 
War was in full swing. Various speakers 
would come through Colorado and would 
present information as to the nature of the 
war and its general significance. I became 
persuaded that in fact it was one of the major 
battlefronts in a growing conflict throughout 
the world between the fascist forces and all 
those who were against such a direction in 
human affairs .... It seemed to me that a 
touchstone of this battJe was represented by 
the Spanish War. Not so much that it was 
militarily significant, but was a kind of micro-
ments that were involved in a world-wide 
scale. And particularly it had a great deal of 
significance for countries like France, Eng-
land and the United States, m terms of mak-
ing the population aware of what the nature 
of the battles were throughout the world. I 
decided that the best thing to do would be 
to become a participant in that war. So I 
volunteered. 

The FBI was quickly informed of Mar-
kert's decision, and he and his roommate 
were denied passports. With help from 
friendly people in New York they were 
able to stow away aboard a freighter 
bound for France. "We had to lie under 
a seaman's bunk for fourteen days, all the 
time, all the way there. A couple of sym-
pathetic crew members fed us." The same 
sailors carried them off the ship, past . 
guards who assumed they were dead 
drunk. In Paris they made contact with 
comrades who soon helped them sneak 
across the Pyrenees into Spain, avoiding 
French police patrols. 

They reached Figueras and joined the 
International Brigades, then went to 
Albaceti for training. The situation was 
critical since Franco was trying to cut 
the Loyalist position in two by means of 
an offensive from his stronghold in the 
North all the way to the Mediterranean.

cosm, a representation of all the major ele-
Markert, having been trained for three 
weeks, was sent to the front with the 
Lincoln-Washington Battalion. 

Well, at the time I joined the battalion it had 
about five hundred members, and we were 
right in the center of the battle. Within a few 
days we were surrounded, and all but fifty of 
us were kiiJed. I was one of the lucky ones, of 
course. When the final breakup occurred, the 
survivors were dispersed at night, and I found 
myself back of the fascist lines and all alone, 
and it took me three days and three nights to 
make my way through the fascist lines until 
I came to the Ebro river which was the tem-
porary boundary between the opposing forces. 
And I swam across the river and was back in 
Loyalist territory. 

Markert regrouped with the Loyalists. 
I was a foot soldier at the beginning, but be-
came a scout. The scouts always proceeded 
the advance of the battalion. They usually 
discovered the enemy by getting shot at. That 
was the most certain way ... to discover 
them. Most all of the scouts were killed of 
course, sooner or later. At the end I was chief 
of the scouts, the Sergeant-in-Charge. But 
there were none at the end who started out 
when I did. They'd all been killed. 

I was very fatalistic about it. I didn't think 
my chances were worth anybody's gamble. 
After all, when you see everybody around 
you dying you can't be too confident it won't 
happen to you in the next few minutes. But 
I never worried about it. I realized that'd be 
one event I'd never regret, so I just didn't give 
it any serious thought. I took all of the nor-
mal, proper evasive action in order to pre-
serve myself in battle. I didn't stick my head 
up unnecessarily. 

In fact it's so hard sometimes that you just 
cancel out the danger and are not willing to 
work so hard any more. Instead of running 
bent over for the next hundred years you say 
'The Hell with it!' and just stand up and walk. 
You get so tired out that you just don't care 
what happens any more. On some marches, 
when we were surrounded, I remember we 
would march for so long, and-then rest for 
a few minutes, and then march again, that 
some individuals wouldn't get up. They'd say 
'Nope, it's not worth it'. 'Well look,' we say, 
'We're surrounded. You stay here and you'll 
be killed.' 'Too bad.' And they'd just stay 
there. We'd kick 'em and stick 'em with a 
bayonet to make 'em move. 

The internationals who remained in late 
1938 were evacuated by the League of 
Nations. The Loyalists had lost the war, 
the Munich agreement had been signed 
and the potentially anti-fascist forces in 
the world had not declared war on the 
menace seen by Markert three years 
earlier. Markert m ade it home for Christ-
mas and three weeks later was a fuU time 
student again. "Some people cannot be-
come satisfactory civilized human beings 
again after being in wars," Markert notes, 
but he himself" ... didn't have any dif-
ficulty at all. I was gone from the univer-
sity exactly a year and took right up where 
I left off." 

On his return Markert refused to join 
Veterans of th~ Abraham Lincoln Brigade 
because he didn't want to become "The 
Old Soldier," and because he felt that, 
"That was a very inefficient and sterile 
way to invest my political energies for 
the future." Today he has no contact with 
anyone he knew well then. 

When the United States finally entered 
the fight against fascism Markert volun-
teered for the Air Corps, which refused 
to accept him because of his "subversive" 
activities. So Markert joined the Merchant 
Marines and spent four years as a radio 
operator. 

While Markert was going to graduate 
school after the war he continued politick-
ing, a part of his life's activity which he 
describes in an exceedingly prosaic way. 
He canvassed for Henry WaUace in 1948 
with the Committee of the Arts, Sciences 
and Professions, which, as J . P. Trinkaus, 
who worked with him then, interprets it, 
represented the American non-communist 
democratic left. Markert just says that he 
was still involved in organizing laborers, 
working for certain pieces of legislation 
or for "this person or that." He began to 
feel that action in purely political arenas 
didn't make much practical difference to 
the advance of the causes in which he 
believed. He grew discouraged and around 
1950 "just stopped" trying to organize 
people. He became a biolosist exclusively, 
moved from department to department 
and built a distinguished career, restricting 
his political expression to radical "inter-
action" with those immediately around 
him and to rational advising of people 
in high places. 

America's prosperity under capitalism 
since World War II surprised Markert 
and seems to have disillusioned him from 
further radical action. The effect of this 
prosperity on American workers, who

shifted their support from one Wallace 
to another twenty years later, was for 
Markert "an ironic, bitter pill to swallow." 

All this changed Markert's perception of 
the system, though not his readiness to 
rail against it, with charges of "outrage," 
"insanity," "absurdity," and "grossly 
distorted" social goals "not worthy of 
the consideration of rational men." 

What really was required was a transforma-
tion of the whole nature of our society and 
after the tremendous battles that were in-
volved in organizing labor-and I played a 
small role in those-it turned out that labor 
became one of the most conservative influ-
ences in our society.! had not the slightest 
interest in bringing about the organization 
of labor if the consequences were that those 
people were then going to be a conservative 
weight on society. And that's exactly what 
happened. I could perceive that sort of thing 
already in the fifti~ven in the forties-then 
it was clear to me that that was a futile way 
to proceed. 

It was also clear that American society 
was not rigid enough to get itself into a rev-
olutionary situation. It would accommodate 
itself to whatever the stresses and strains of 
changing views were, to make them fit the 
circumstances. I don't particularly like that, 
since I'm not particularly enamored of our 
society and I'd like to see it disintegrate and 
something better formed. 

No, I don't have any confidence in the 
mass of the people in terms of their ability 
to see the truth. Certainly the idea which I 
shared at one time, that one could have a lot 
of confidence in the common man as it were, 
is a bunch of nonsense. Their personal de-
velopment leaves a lot to be desired. 

One factor in Markert's withdrawal from 
active radicalism seems to have been his 
investigation for subversive activity dur-
ing the McCarthy era, although be does 
not mention the inquiry in that context 
himself. He refused to testify before a 
witch-hunting subcommittee of the Ho~se 
Un-American Activities Committee while 
be was an assistant professor at the Uni-
versity of Michigan in 1954. For this re-
fusal he nearly lost his post in the biology 
department, but after very adroit politick-
ing and with the help of others on the 
Michigan faculty, a committee which 
voted to fire two of his colleagues decided 
to retain him. Markert proudly attributes 
his survival in that situation to the high 
quality of his research. His good work is 
his hook in the system which forces people 
to keep him around whatever they think 
of his views. And indeed Roger Pedersen, 
one of Markert's graduate students who 
has been active in the Resistance at Yale 
says, "The most important thing Markert 
represents to me is that if you're good you 
don't have to be afraid of getting into 
trouble with the system. He helps me feel 
I'm free to be political now." 

Markert is not quite so confident that 
this is the case. One of the biologists fired 
by Michigan in 1954 went into exile in 
Canada and continued his scientific work 
successfully. Markert wouldn't have gone 
to Canada, even though his career in the 
United States would have been ruined. "If 
I had been axed at Michigan," he says 
now, " I might have been forced into politi-
cal life." Markert's important discoveries 
in biology all came after 1954. 

As Clement Markert has become a more 
sophisticated scientist, and as he has be-
come progressively more interested in 
world population problems. his notions 
of which forces are most important in 
society have been rearranged. Mass politi-
cal action has been debased in his heir-
archy of forces, and the role of sound 
advice given at strategic points within the 
system has been upgraded. On the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences' Committee 
on Science and Public Policy, which he 
considers the "most prestigious scientific 
group in the country outside the govern-
ment," he knows that, "A person like me 
all by myself can hope to have some in-
fluence. A few hours spent working on 
that are likely to have a thousand times 
more effect than a thousand hours spent 
trying to organize a peace demonstration." 

The Committee on Science and Public 
Policy met two months ago with Lee 
DuBridge, Nixon's new science advisor. 
Markert believes his committtee's esta~ 
lishment of a Committee on Population 
Control several years ago was chiefly re-
sponsible for changing the attitude of the 
Kennedy administration towards birth 
control from indifference and hostility to 
promotion of contraceptives. 

I consider that a fundamental advance. Most 
great transformations in human events do 
not occur on the battlefield. They occur in 
people being persuaded that they should have 
two kids instead of four, say. That bas more 
effect than any dramatic political battle. 

I think I can have a more radical effect 
functioning in that area of human affairs 
than I can as just one of another of thousands 
or millions in the final cataclysmic show-
downs of political confrontations. Those to 
me are just terminal expressions and are not 
the forces that really reshape society. 

These are not changes in policy from the 
top but physical differences in the way men 
live which are brought about by science and 
technology, and which then influence their 
thinking. For example, agriculture became so 
productive that everybody moved off the 
farms. Farming became a trivial aspect of 
American society. And that's all happened 
in the last twenty years. 

It wasn't any political revolution that pro-
duced that. In the 1930's the farmer was a 
very important political force in our society. 
Now he doesn't count for anything. That was 
a tremendous transformation. more dramatic 
than it would have been if he had been con-
quered by an army. 

It is not hard to understand Clement 
Markert's thirty-year transition from a 
radical organizer to an elitist technocrat. 
He has always been aware of the vanguard 
and wants very much to be in it. 

For example, he is highly skeptical of 
the competence of Yale undergraduates 
who are "not quite adult" to know what 
they need academically and even emo-
tionally, much less to know enough to 
play a role in the administration of Yale. 
The biology department, however, was 
the first Yale department to have under-
graduate representation on its Course of 
Study Committee. One of his colleagues 
gives himself the credit for convincing 
Markert to make the innovation. "I said, 
'Look, Clem, do you want us to be first 
in something?' And be always does!" So 
the change was made. 

Roger Pederson, who seems as close as 
anyone to being a disciple of Markert, 
explains that in his teaching and style as 
a scientist Markert places the highest 
value on steering inquiry and research 
toward the most fundamental and far-
reaching problems in the discipline. Ac-
cordingly, Pederson reports that the nine 
graduate students working with Markert 
will be shifting the field of their research 
beginning next year from isozyme bio-
chemistry to work with mouse embryos 
cultured in test tubes. This work, which 
depends on culture techniques that have 
only been developed in the last two years, 
could have profound implications for 
humans within a few more years. And 
Clement Markert, for his part, is ready 
to actualize some of these implications. 

If I discover some way of causing human 
beings to be one genotype or another, that 
could be of some consequence even in my 
lifetime. We could produce a thousand Ein-
stein types, or Horowitzes, or something 
like that. We'll be able to do that, if we want 
to, and I'd like to see it tried. 

Mr. Markert, however, considers this type 
of work of low priority compared to the 
social task of making it possible for people 
to develop fully according to their current 
genotypes. Moreover, he claims he feels no 
sense of urgency in his interests in genetics 
and development, beyond his scientist's 
urge to understand the world, since the 
problems of future races of men are be-
yond his and all men's capacities for 
empathy. 

In fact, as we are at this moment, if we were 
transplanted by some magical time travel 
into some society ten thousand years hence 
composed of very different human beings, 
we wouldn't like it at all. We can only ap-
preciate and profit by a society which is based 
on the kind of people we are at this moment-
not upon some different kind of person. We 
wouldn't like things ten thousand years from 
now any more than some chimpanzees would 
like to take up residence in the Kline Biology 
Tower. They much prefer it out in the 
jungles. 

Markert is emphatic in his belief that 
biology is the most humanistic discipline 
at Yale, because during the forseeable 
future it will have more to say, and more 
to actually define, about the nature of 
men than any other discipline. Markert 
is eager to thrash out ahead of time ethical 
and practical questions which inevitably 
grow out of research in human genetics 
and reproduction. He is excited about a 
new biology course for non-science majors 
which his
