policy with openness, honesty and candor. 
My own column, which Mr. Goldberger 
has incorrectly interpreted as News policy 
~eiterated this request and went beyond ' 
1t to both support Mr. Paros's ideas 
and criticize administration handling 
of the Summer High School issue. I do 
not believe that Mr. Paros is infallible; he 
has made mistakes as he indicates quite 
clearly i~ his Director's Report. He may 
even be mcompetent; 1 haven't accused 
him of being so because I have seen no 
evidence to prove it and much to the con-
trary. But nothing Mr. Paros has done or 
could do would warrant the treatment 
he has received from Joel Fleishman 
Jonathan Fanton, Richard Sewall and 
The New Journal. For the consequences 
of that view, I, not the News, should bear 
full responsiblity.
