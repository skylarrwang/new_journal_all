A Magazine ... 
Every issue demands the talent and energy of dozens of writers, 
production people and business staffers. We have high 
expectations of ourselves and, after more than two full years of 
quality journalism, so do our readers. 

But no matter how good The New Journal has been, it can be 
better. We are as interested in learning from you as we are 
willing to teach you what we already know. 

To learn more about The New Journal call Editor W. Hampton 
Sides at 865-1554 or Publisher Hilary Callahan 432-3219. Or, 
attend our organizational meeting on Tuesday, October 25th 
at 8 p.m. in the Berkeley Common Room .
