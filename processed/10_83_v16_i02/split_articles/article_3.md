Dissection versus Delight: 
Forgetting Why Wa Read Literature
Teacher: (Reading lines from A Mid-
summer Night's Drtam) 
For ere Demetrius looked on Hermia's eyne, 
He hailed down oaths that he was only mine; 
And when thif hail some heat from Hermia felt, 
So h' dissolved, and showers of oaths dtd melt 
Now class, what do you make 
of this? Anyone? Eric? 
Student: (Gulping). It's . 
. uh just 
... PRECIPITATION. 

This is a transcription, recorded to the 
best of my memory of an exchange be-
tween a professor and me in English 
129 my freshman year. This and 
similar best-forgotten experiences con-
vinced me to leave Yale after one year 
and enroll in my home state school, the 
University of Kansas. It was only 
there, in a program called the In-
tegrated 
Humanities, 
that 
I 
was 
reminded of what I had been missing 
in my courses at Yale: that ticklish 
vibration touching the heart, mind, 
soul or some combination thereof. 

I was missing the humanities them-
selves. 

My professor wanted to hear: "Snow 
and other forms of precipitation are a 
recurring motif in the play. Shake-
speare's use of snow here is probably 
meant to contras 
's pure 
white love with the more watery love of 
_____ who uses the metaphor of 
rain." To which he would have replied, 
"Good. Do you see the thunderstorm 
in Act III fitting into this pattern?" The 
culmination of such a line of analysis 
would be the construction of a huge 
schematic of the play, preferably in 
three dimensions, showing the plot, 
subplots, 
c haracters, symbols, 
metaphors and themes in all their 
inter-relationships-a chart much like 
the anatomist's fold-over transparen-
cies of the human body. 

The temptation to analyze great art 
in this fashion is understandable. If 
art's workings seem as complicated and 
intriguing as life itself, it's because they 
are. Shakespeare is living literature. 

Editions of the great authors have 
periodically come out as pocket "com-
panions," and 
the epithet is ap-
propriate. 

But how do you get to know your 
friends? Do you say, "My, it appears 
you have a healthy underlying bone 
stratum"? Or do you simply share in-
sights and laughter? We have potential 
companions in all the great authors, 
but at Yale we line them up like 
cadavers in anatomy class. 

At KU my professors often simply 
read the passage slowly, savoring every 
word, bringing out the poetry, majesty 
and mystery of the lines, perhaps ad-
ding a relevant illustration from life. 

For Shakespeare did not write and l}rt•-
sent his plays for listeners to analy?.c' 
and categorize afterwards. Rather, he 
wrote them for 1tsteners to hear the 
words one after the other and he 
moved by them, touched by some fresh 
facet of eternal truth or new inkling of 
the delights and woes of man's lot . 

(How else was the playwright to mt•t•t 
his payroll at the Globe?) 

Helena's lines are great and are 
studied and remembered bentusc.· thc.·y 
are beautiful. People customarily think 
of music as being confined to the 88 
notes of the A-440 scale, but tht• 
sounds of ~poke n language have thl'ir 
own mu~ic as well and can be arrangt•d 
in ways that arc equally pleasurahlt• to 
the human ear:
