**The Master in South Africa**
**Author: Kathleen Cleaver interviewing Robin Winks**
**Page number(s): 26-27**

Robin Winks, Master of Berkeley College 
and professor of British history, spent last 
summer in South Africa teaching at the elite 
Afrikaner University of Stellenbosch. 

A 
decision to go to South Africa is a controver-
sial one. For many years various intellec-
tuals, entertainers dnd athletes have r~fused to 
visit the country as a w~y of prote.rtin.l!. its 
open(y racist policies. 

L!fe in South Africa is dominated kY a 
rt~ffid system of racial classifications known 
as "apartheid" which means "separatene.u" in 
Afrikaans, one of the three main lan,l!,uages 
spoken in South Africa. 

Or~l!,inal(y imposed 
by the South African govemment in 1.948 to 
protect the he,l!,emony of the small white 
minority, the system has grown into a rz:l!,id 
social framework which cons(l!,ns the over-
whelmin.tf African majority to a /ffe f!{ 
' economic slavery devoid of legal or political 
r(l!,hts. Since the 1960's the country has com~ 
under increasing international pressure to 
change its policies. 

Winks was invited to teach at Stellenho.rch 
by Herman Guillome, a leadin.l!. Afrikaner 
historian who during several visits to Yale 
found that Winks shared his interest in the 
moral problems posed by teachin,lf history in a 
count~y like South Africa. But when Guil-
lome was denied tenure at Stellenbosch lor 
speaking out a,l!,ainst discrimination in 'his 
country, Winks found his invitation to teach 
history was not valid without his sponsor. 

He went to Stellenbosch a~yway, but on(y 
qfter a,l!,reein.l!. to teach Amm'can economic 
history. 

Winks also traveled extensively throughout 
southern Africa on a lecture tour sponsored by 
the United States /~ormation Agency. He 
spoke on Amvican fore(l!,n policy and race 
relations, black· history and literature and oc-
casionally on detective fiction. One of the 
places he visited was Zimbabwe, a ne~l!,hhor­
ing country which achieved black mqjori~y 
rule in 1.980. 

Kathleen 
Cleaver, 
who interviewed 
Winks, has been inter~.rted in international 
race relations all of her l!{tt. In 1.967 she 
joined the Black Panther Party and r"v~d a.r 
its communications secretary: In 1.96.9 she 
and her husband Eldridge Cleaver went into 
exile in A~l!,ert'a. The Cleavers returned to 
America in 1.975, and Kathleen enrolled at 
Yale in 1981. She is now a senior in 
Calhoun Colle,l!,e. 

TNJ: It's not easy for everyone to get 
into South Africa. They have a rather 
restrictive policy. Did you have any 
difficulty getting there? 

RW: Nothing that could be called 
serious difficulty because I was being 
invited by the university. After I ap-
plied for the visa, however, the issuing 
officer asked me to sign a statement 
that I would write nothing about South 
Africa at any time. I said I wouldn't 
sign that statement , but I would under-
take not to write while in South Africa 
hecause historians didn't work to that 
pare. I wasn't going to produce some 
instant journalism and file stories while 
moving around in South Africa. But I 
wouldn't undertake a statement that 
would prevent me from commenting 
freely and writing about South Africa 
if I wanted to after I returned. And 
that was all right after I said that. They 
removed the need to sign that state-
mt·nt . 

TNJ: How are the students that you 
taught at Stcllenbosch different from 
th<· students that come to an American 
public or private university? 

RW: I was teaching the American 
equivalent of seniors and M.A. can-
didates. These students are in the nar-
row sense of the term quite · well 
educated. In South Africa you begin 
specializing the 
m inute you walk 
through the door. There's no general 
liheral education. This meant that they 
knew very little history, even the most 
fundamental simple references such as 
Woodrow Wilson and the entry into 
World War I- that would often be 
meaningless to them so that the level at 
whkh one would teach fa<·tually had to 
he relatively simple. 

Students in South Africa generally 
do not work very hard. The atmos-
phere of South Africa's unversities, at 
least the white universities, is very 
reminiscent of the 1950's. Films are 
censored; books are censored . The 
book won't twin the university library, 
or it will be kt-pt under lo<·k a nd key for 
spe<'ial study so the university auth-
orities can control and know who is 
reading the book. There's a national 
film board so that the students never 
see the more radical films or films that 
contain sexual references. T he at-
mosphere is very much that of the 
1950's . in the sense that they dress in 
what I would call the bobby sox tradi-
tion. The height of the social occasion 
would be to have at the student union 
building what they call a "sockie," 
which is a shoeless dance. This was lelt 
to be quite daring . 

TNJ: How did you, approach the sub-
ject of apartheid in your lectures? 

RW: There have been American lec-
turers who have gone in and on their 
first lecture insulted everybody in 
South Africa, told them what a hateful 
system it is, and of course the students 
stop coming after the second lecture. 
So you have to be relatively gentle in 
the way in which you try to challenge 
people. 

It is very commonly believed in 
South Africa that the United States is 
very much like South Africa. I felt the 
most productive thing I could do was 
demonstrate to them that while cer-
tainly there had been slavery and a 
long tradition of racism in the United 
States, that the roots of that were often 
different, and it produced a different 
result, and that there really was hope 
for them to bring change. One of the 
deep problems, I think, in South 
Africa is even the liberal Afrikaners 
who would like to change keep saying 
there's no way for us to get out of it. It's 
important, I think, for the outsider to 
say, "No, there are ways to get out of 
it." Otherwise a kind of fatalism sets in, 
and they just sink deeper into apar-
theid. 

TNJ: How do you think, in retrospect, 
the students viewed you? H ow did they 
classify you in terms of American posi-
tions?

RW: They pretty clearly saw that I was 
an American who very instinctively as 
well as intellectually disapproved of
