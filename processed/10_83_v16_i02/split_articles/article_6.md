The One-man Ministry of 
Pars.on Paul 
Paul Keane takes a drag of his 
smoldering cigar as he sits in Patricia's 
Restaurant. "You are unfortunately 
sitting in the presence of a heretic," he 
says, smiling. Parson Paul is not a 
typical Yale Divinity School graduate. 
He is an agnostic who operates a one-
man ministry from his apartment in 
one of the city's low-income housing 
pr~jccts, the Seabury Co-op. The 
patrons at Patricia's know him as The 
Bishop of Broadway, an activist who 
deals with the seamier sides of life in 
New Haven. 

For the past few months Keane has 
been preoccupied with the local prob-
lems surrounding Acquired Immune 
Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), 
the 
much-publicized disease 
that has 
spread at a geometric rate in the last 
three years among gays, intravenous 
drug users, hemophiliacs, Haitians 
and the sex partners of these groups. 
One day this summer Keane discov-
ered a discarded hypodermic needle in 
the parking lot of the Seabury com-
plex, 
where 
he 
is 
the building 
superintendent. 
He had reason 
to 
believe that prostitutes who frequent 
the area had discarded the possibly 
contaminated needle and that children 
playing there might be in danger of in-
fection. He also accidentally punctured 
himself once with a needle he found in 
the garbage chute. But it wasn't until 
an acquaintance died of AIDS that 
Keane decided to take action. "The 
best ministry for me is in areas people 
won't touch with a ten-foot pole," he 
says. "I love a taboo, so this was for 
me. I knew no one else would do it." 
Keane looks onto Whalley Avenue 
now, more intently than usual. and 
lowers his voice. "Someone died of 
AIDS in Connecticut recently," he 
says. "This was a person who had had 
dozens of sexual contacts with Yale gay 
and bisexual males in the past three 
years. There is also an I. V. drug user 
in New Haven who is a presumed 
AIDS carrier and who continues to 
share needles every day with unsuspec-
ting strangers." 

As a concerned clergyman. Keane is 
facing a problem. Although he knows 
the identities of the victims he men-
tions. he cannot legally reveal them. 
No tests have yet been developed to 
prove that sonwont' has AIDS. whid1

"People are now In a state 
- of ethical confusion about 
AIDS." 
takes up to three years to surface. Thus 
it is possible to carry and transmit the 
syndrome without knowing it. If so-
meone is suspected of having AIDS, 
nothing can legally stop him o r her 
from continuing to transmit it. "They 
can't take your rights away without due 
process of the law," Keane says, "and 
there's no proof with AIDS. 
"People are now in a state of ethical 
confusion about the disease," he says. 
"The medical advisors of these victims 
spoke to me in confidence as a clergy-
man about their ethical dilemma. 
They have a professional obligation, 
but they also feel that society has the 
right to be protected. They didn't know 
what to do, and I didn't either." 

He believes education is one of the 
best ways to approach the ethical 
dilemma over AIDS. With the help of 
Yale biology professor Or. 
Alvin 
Novick, Keane produced "Needles, 
Sex, and A.I.D.S." a pamphlet written 
in stnÂ·ct language. "Writing this was a 
compromist' between violating tht' 
rights of the presumed AIDS victims 
and doing nothing," explains Keane. 
"With a typewriter. some stamps and a 
Xerox machine, there are a few things 
I can change without needing 100 ac-
tivists. Doing nothing is immoraL" 

The pamphlet was designed to teach 
methods of avoiding the disease, such 
as taking precautions when having sex 
with members of high risk groups and 
boiling hypodermic needles for 20 
minutes before sharing them. Pro-
duced by an unlikely combination of a 
street minister, 
a 
Yale professor, 
several physicians and a philanthropic 
printer, the pamphlet was distributed 
to the Y.M.C.A.'s drug program, Col-
umbus House, the University Chap-
lain and the Chief of Police. Keane 
wanted to inform and warn the entire 
community. "The news media has 
gone wrong in this area," he says. 
"AIDS is not a gay plague but a public 
health issue. No one deals with the 
other victims: I . V. drug users or bisex-
ual males who have sex with gays, or 
females" (who make up eight percent of 
the AIDS victims). 

Keane is concerned about the syn-
drome's threat to Yale students, both 
gay and straight. He brought the issue 
to the attention of the Yale administra-
tion in September and wrote President 
Giamatti a letter warning him about 
the potential risks. Keane is currently 
working with Peaches Quinn of Uni-
versity Health Services on another 
pamphlet, "A.I.D.S., Sex, and You," 
designed for Yale students. He worries 
about what he calls "a profound 
naivete" at Yale about who's in danger. 
"Anyone who's had sex with people 
whose biographies they don't know 
back at least three years may be at 
risk," says Keane. "People who fre-
quent prostitutes may be putting 
themselves in danger, as prostitutes 
might either use I. V. drugs or have sex 
with those who do. We often think I. V. 
drug users are bums, but we're naive if 
we think Yale students don't use 
recreational needles." 

Since so many people could be in 
danger, Keane feels it is crucial to in-
form the general community about the 
disease. "The people who get AIDS are 
subject to persecution," he says, strok-
ing his beard thoughtfuiJy. "People like 
to hate gays, prostitutes and drug 
users. But everyone has a right ,to be 
healthy, to be informed that they're at 
risk.

"The public is susceptible to gossip 
and fear," he says. "Without facts, 
we're likely to become witch-hunters, 
but with AIDS there are enough facts 
around so we don't have to surrender 
to the animal instinct to hate. We can 
let people hear the facts and become 
less afraid. It's like applying salve to a 
wound. I believe you cure fear with 
facts." 

What Keane fears most is a recurrence 
of the kind of uninformed lynch-mob 
mentality he saw while he was atten-
ding Kent State University. Keane 
was a graduate student at the Ohio 
university when National Guardsmen 
killed four student protesters on May 
4, 1970. "I was close enough to see the 
smoke from the guardsmen's rifles," he 
says. "Then I heard somebody shout 
'They killed him!' I looked down and 
saw Jeffrey Miller on the ground. His 
head had been blown off. I remember 
seeing the mother of a Kent State stu-

wrong In this area. AIDS is

public health Issue." 
dent on a document.ary film. She said, 
'If my son had long hair and sandals, 
he should have been shot, too.' That 
was a quality of human fear I'll never 
forget." 

Keane remained at Kent State for 
four years, studying and working to 
obtain a federal grand jury investiga-
tion into the incident. "After the 
shootings I couldn't concentrate," he 
says. "I kept taking courses and drop-
ping them, and it took me that long to 
get a two-year degree." 

After the killings Keane became 
more and more politically active, form-
ing a liaison between the university, 
the White House and the parents of the 
victims. He helped collect 50,000 
signatures calling for federal investiga-
tion into the incident. As a result the 
National Guardsmen were required to 
testify under oath, a national prece-
dent. Keane later coordinated the 
Center for Peaceful Change, which 
commemorated the deaths at Kent 
State.
