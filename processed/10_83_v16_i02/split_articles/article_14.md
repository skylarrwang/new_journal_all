thought it was going to bring utter 
disaster to everyone in the country, 
black and white. I was trying, in a 
sense, to outline for them as the next 
generation of leaders 
alternative 
scenarios for South Africa. And they 
are the next generation of leaders at 
Stellenbosch. Every Prime Minister of 
South Africa but one has come out of 
that university. It's like being at Har-
vard or Yale in the United States or at 
Oxford and Cambridge in England. 
TNJ: What issues were you outspoken 
on? 
RW: I was convinced that the most 
serious matter in South Africa is the at-
tempt on the part of the military, 
which has far more power in the current 
administration, 
to destabilize their 
neighbors. They are systematically try-
ing to undo the governments of Zim-
babwe, Lesotho, Angola, Mozam-
bique and probably Botswana. They 
are certainly not doing anything effec-
tive to stabilize Namibia. And I very 
often and very publicly kept saying 
that the South African government must 
stop this if it declares itself to truly be a 
bulwark of capitalism in southern 
Africa. The capitalists couldn't care less 
about the ideology of the neighboring 
states if those states will deliver high 
quality goods on time. And the mil-
itary therefore is deeply anti-capitalist 
in South Africa and is, in fact, the most 
subversive influence in South Africa, 
far more subversive than any alleged 
left wing or liberationist movement. 
That's a pretty sharp message to be 
delivering, and I delivered it very 
often. It appeared in the press. And yet 
the students kept sitting back waiting 
for somebody to slap my wrist, and 
nobody did. 
TNJ: I take it no South African pro-
fessor could stand up and say that in 
class? Or could they? 
RW: Yes, but they would be im-
mediately identified with what's now 
called the "overexposed enlightened" 
faction. Certainly that group is saying 
exactly what I was saying. They can 
say so certainly without being arrested 
in the night. It's not a police state. One 
shouldn't assume that because you 
speak out against the government that 
some gestapo is going to show up in the 
middle of the night and cart you away. 
To that extent there's freedom of 
speech. Though what will happen is 
that people will find that they are 
blocked in their academic progress. 
TNJ: Like the McCarthy period here? 
RW: Yes. Herman Giliomee (who in-
vited Wink to South Africa) is 
a member of this so-called over-exposed 
enlightened group. He's not going to 
be arrested, and he won't lose his job. 
On the other hand he didn't get pro-
moted to full professor, though he is 
widely 
regarded 
as 
the 
most 
distinguished Afrikaner historian in 
the country. 
TNJ: Would you tell us about your 
visit to Fort Hare in Ciskei? 
RW: Fort Hare is the oldest and most 
distinguished of the black universities. 
It was founded by the British in the 
19th century to train, according to the 
terminology of the time, black leaders. 
Many of the black nationalist leaders 
of other countries are Fort 
Hare 
graduates. It's certainly the liveliest of 
the universities that I visited in South 
Africa, white or black, in the sense that 
students do discuss matters, ask their 
visitors questions sharply and chal-
lenge 
everything 
that 
they 
hear. 
Whether they challenge their own pro-
fessors, I don't know. But I had the 
most exciting intellectual experience at 
that university. I gave a good lecture 
on race relations in the United States. 
Immediately the questions started to 
flow. And they very quickly and skill-
fully turned the questions toward 
South Africa, knowing perfectly well I 
was prepared to speak on that subject 
but had not been invited to speak on 
that subject. The questions went on for 
over an hour afterward.

Ten years ago I lectured at every 
university in South Africa. Fort Hare 
University was decrepit, under threat 
of being closed down. I gave a lecture 
to the entire assembled student body 
ten years ago. We met in an old mis-
sionary hall in which the Bureau of 
State Security were present quite con-
sciously, quite physically, standing at 
the back of the room taping my lec-
tures and insisting that any students 
who asked a question had to stand and 
identify themselves by name so they 
could be recorded on the tape which, of 
course, would have an enormously in-
timidating effect upon any questions. I 
said that they could tape my lecture, 
but I would not permit any taping of 
the questions. The lecture was delayed 
about an hour and a quarter before 
they would agree finally to that. So the 
Bureau of State Security rather osten-
tatiously, as soon as I'd finished my 
lecture, undid their tape recorders and 
left. Now we all knew they were setting 
them up somewhere else. I said to the 
students that while it may be that the 
questions are being taped remotely, do 
not state your name. I have no need to 
know what your name is for you to ask 
the question. And a couple of days 
after that lecture I and my escort were 
stopped on the road and delayed to 
such an extent that I wasn't able to give 
my next lecture at the University of 
Zululand because they weren't about to 
have that same scenario played out 
there. 

The difference between ten years 
ago and now is enormous. This time 
there was absolutely no evidence at any 
time that anybody was taping this lec-
ture. There was no hint that people 
had to identify themselves by name in 
order to ask a question. The facilities 
were brand new and very handsome. 
And it clearly is meant to be not only a 
showplace, but also a place that is 
educating a 
new black leadership 
group. 
TNJ: But educating black leadership 
in a context of apartheid. 
RW: Oh, absolutely. 
TNJ: It seems that there's a different 
kind of consciousness among the black 
students in South Africa than there is 
among the white students. 
RW: Oh, I think there is. The very cir-
cumstances of society teach the black 
student to question authority. And the 
circumstances of society at the 
Afrikaans-medium universities in par-
ticular lead the Afrikaans students to 
be intense respecters of authority. I 
had the feeling that I could tell the 
Afrikaans students that the United 
States doesn't consist of 50 states; there 
are 53. And they would write it down 
without someone saying he'd heard dif-
ferently. Or I could tell them the moon 
was made of green cheese. They would 
immediately know that was a lie, but 
they wouldn't tell me they knew it was 
a lie. They would just say quietly in 
their minds that he's lying to us. They 
would feel no need to contradict me. 
Whereas the African students would 
tell me, "We know you're lying to us," 
or "Aren't you making a mistake, 
aren't the facts the following?" It's in 
the culture. 
TNJ: How pervasive is apartheid in 
South Africa? 
As to how pervasive apartheid is, it's 
the one question that any conversation 
comes to. Let me give you an example. 
You'll often be served wine, and the 
conversation will turn to, "Why don't 
you drink our fine wines in the United 
States?" There is only one conceivable 
answer. And that is "We don't wish to 
drink them. It's not because they are 
bad wines. It's not because you 
couldn't deliver them to us cheaply. 
But it would be a political act to drink 
them." Now time and time again I en-
countered folks who didn't understand 
that. That is, they don't understand 
how the apartheid system is related to 
everything else. 
TNJ: 
Do 
you 
believe 
Afrikaner mentality 
is 
rather 
apolitical? 
RW: I'm saying it's rather naive, yes. 
They think of themselves as very 
tough-minded, but they can be easily 
led by the government to believe that 
any protest is Communist-inspired. 
They accept whatever the press prints 
about the United States, and what is 
printed about the United States is 
grotesquely misstated, even factually: 
references in the press to the city of 
Montana in the state of Missoula. The 
level of ignorance, even on the factual 
level, let alone being able to interpret 
and understand, is quite absolutely ap-
palling.

TNJ: I'd like to hear how you con-
trasted your visit to Zimbabwe with 
your experience in South Africa. 
RW: Zimbabwe is a country that 
seems to me is working rather well 
given the persistent efforts of South 
Africa to destabilize it. Harare, the 
capital, the former Salisbury, is a 
booming city. I felt I saw mainly signs 
of stability and of good interracial har-
mony. As you walk about in the streets 
of Harare, which is a modern clean ci-
ty, I think that one sees very little sense 
of tension. I think it's a mistake for the 
black African governments to bar 
South Africans from visiting because 
the press in South Africa, while not 
massively censored, is a very restricted 
press. Most white South Africans, in-
cluding those who see themselves as 
liberal, really believe that all black 
African governments are dreadfully 
mismanaged, that every country in 
black Africa is in chaos, that murder is 
occurring on the streets daily, that it's 
unsafe to walk about. They have a 
totally distorted image of what life is 
like in black Africa. People in the United States who 
say "Why don't you choose being discriminated against in South Africa simply 
as those who were discriminated 
against in the United States?" don't 
understand the situation. It's illegal for 
more than three people to meet together 
for political purposes in South 
Africa. You can't have a group of pro-
testers meet and 
carry placards 
because they will 
be immediately 
removed by the police. The system ex-
erts very sharp punishments against 
those who for political or any other 
reasons step out of line. And most pro-
tests develop some violence ultimately. 
TNJ: There's a tendency to compare 
South Africa with the United States 
that obscures some very fundamental 
differences. For unlike the South 
where blacks were imported as slaves, 
in South Africa the Africans were over 
several centuries the target of assaults 
by the whites who attempted to destroy 
their independence, destroy their self-
sufficiency and force the Africans to 
work for them. And to this day it is the 
control of African labor that is a basic 
component of the 
South 
African 
system. For unlike America, South 
Africa's whites are entirely dependent 
upon cheap black labor for their 
economic advantages. 
RW: There is a presumption that there 
are elements that are parallel in the two 
histories. There certainly are not many 
elements that are parallel, but it is 
quite commonly believed by white
