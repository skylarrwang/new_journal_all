of papers on the killings and gave them 
to Yale. "Kent State University was a 
puppet of Ohio," he says, "and couldn't 
be counted on to protect those docu-
ments. It would give me no guarantee 
that they would be kept safe. Having 
the archives here is an irritation and 
embarrassment to Kent State and 
Ohio, a constant reminder that justice 
has not been done." 


The Kent State episode left its scars 
on Parson Paul, including the begin-
nings of a drinking problem. "Drink-
ing was a way of escaping the tremen-
dous anger I felt afterwards. I was a 
victim of a cultural prejudice that 
smart people can't be alcoholics. I 
thought I was too intelligent to have a 
drinking problem." With the help of 
Akoholics Anonymous, he stopped 
drinking several years ago. "It was one 
of the most powerfully spiritual ex-
periences of my life." 


Ih 1976 he enrolled in the Yale 
Divinity School "to find out if God 
could be responsible for events like 
Kent State. I wan ted to find out the 
truth. The truth is that no one knows 
it, and that's a tremendous relief. I'm 
relieved of the burden of not having 
found it. There's no knowledge, just 
faith. I've received a tremendous gift in 
learning to see that I'm free, that I'm 
not a prisoner of anyone's creed and 
neither is anyone else." 


While at the Divinity School he 
established 
the 
First Church of 
Synergy in 1977, founded on the 
theory of R . Buckminster Fuller that 
the whole is more than the sum of 
its 
parts. 
K eane's Congregation 
of four graduated with him in 1980. A 
year later he published Holy Smoke, 
essays collected in a biblical parody 
that depicts M ae West in terms of 
ministry and sp irituality and includes a 
Book of Lennon. Said Divinity School 
professor R owan A. Greer in his in-
troduction to the work: "It is as a gad-
fly that Mr. Keane serves us best. 
Someone has to observe the emperor's 
new clothes for what they are. It is a 
voice worth hearing." 


Parson Paul's creed is closely tied to 
his activism. "I just can't stand the way 
things are sometimes. I don't know 
where that comes from. Maybe it's a 
higher power that gives me a drive to 
do something, a drive from beyond," 
he says. "But when you narrow it down 
and call it God or J esus, it's unfair to 
those who don't know about them. I 
see J esus as the ultimate pantheism. 
Everyone has his own. Oral Roberts 
has one. Norman Vincent Peale has 
one. It's almost like the pantheon of 
Greek gods, but they're all Jesus. The

"I understand all the arguments 
against the existence of God," he 
quickly adds, "and I'm the hardest-
baked agnostic there is. But I do 
believe in th e spiritual aspect of life. 
The power gives you energy and com-
passion that you wouldn't believe you 
could have, simply given the chemical 
components. of your body. I really 
believe it can make you more than the 
sum of your parts. That's not some-
thing you get through prayer, not 
something you get through sitting in a 
piece of real estate called a church." In-
stead Keane ascribes to the idea of "a 
church without walls" and calls his 
work "an unauthorized, unacknowl-
edged and unsolicited ministry. No big 
shot can tell me to shut up or he'll take 
my church away." 


Keane doesn't believe in bowing 
down and worshipping this power. "I 
believe you worship when you revere 
something that is sacred," he says. "I 
believe human life is sacred, and be-
tween Kent State and this AIDS thing, 
I've spent a good deal of my time pay-
ing homage to the sacredness of human 
life."
