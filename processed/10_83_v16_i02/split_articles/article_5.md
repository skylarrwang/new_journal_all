**Title: University Pictures**

He doesn't expect to make so much of a dent into the profits of a commercial movie industry dominated by Goliaths. But David Lee '85, co-founder of the newly established University Pictures, would like to surpass the grainy, wobbly, self-conscious products which are the trademarks of so many amateur home film makers. Lee is not yet anticipating any off-campus releases but he would like to screen some of his films at the Law School Film Society.


University Pictures has already begun planning its first projects including a number of shorts entitled "Man in the Street." Bob Simonds '85, another co-founder, plans to lend Super-8 cameras to interested students and set them loose on the streets of New Haven.


Other ideas include a video documentary of the Groton anti-Trident submarine demonstration and a 16mm short entitled "The Hanged Man" which is a ten minute "futurist adventure" currently in production.


The biggest obstacle University Pictures must face is fund raising. It takes a careful film maker to keep the cost of a ten minute, 16mm movie under $1,000. University Pictures will consider using less expensive video tape. But as Lee puts it, "Video is like tissue paper, and film is like canvas."


At its first organizational meeting, University Pictures attracted over 100 students. "The best thing was that most of them weren't asking for money," said Mark Harris, another co-founder. The recruits were eager to take on the unglamorous tasks of fund raising, publicity and technical support.


Eventually Lee would like to develop a true "film community" at Yale. He and others have considered sponsoring a student film festival later this year. If they can raise the money, University Pictures plans eventually to subsidize student film making ventures on a regular basis.


**Title: The Hart Advantage**

Gary Hart is no front runner in the Democratic race for President, but his supporters at Yale hope to change that. They've launched an aggressive campaign in the dining halls and meeting rooms of Yale to organize student workers to help the Colorado senator's faltering campaign.


Many of their efforts have been geared toward the crucial New Hampshire primary to be held in February. Hart hopes to score an upset in this key race with the help of a large retinue of student volunteers. Traditionally students flock to this small New England state in the weeks leading up to the primary to knock on doors and distribute literature for their favorite candidate. But Hart's supporters have started unusually early. In the first week of this month over 500 students descended upon the state to work for their candidate, 35 of them from Yale.


The Yale group was organized by Peter Henkel, a sophomore in Trumbull whose father is running Hart's national campaign. They hope to return to New Hampshire several times before the big day. "Other Converse initiatives are looking to Yale for support for their campaign," Henkel said. "It's important that our group be well-organized."


Another Yale and candidate Hart connection is a long way back. A graduate from Yale Divinity School in 1974, Hart canvassed extensively at Yale in 1974. His campaign manager, Oliver Henkel, is another '84 Yale graduate.


Most of the other Presidential candidates have established campaign coordinators at Yale but have not begun to campaign as aggressively as Hart. Candidates like Mondale and Glenn have the advantage of greater name recognition, which is precisely what candidate Hart needs to capitalize on before the real campaigning begins.


**Title: Doonesbury: The Musical**
**Page number(s): 9**

Doonesbury is back. After having abandoned their 6-by-2 inch rectangle in newspapers across the country, in December, Boopsie, Zonker, Mike and R.C. will make their first flesh and blood appearance this month.


Gary Trudeau, Yale class of 1970, has turned his talents to musical theater. The Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist has written both script and lyrics for a show entitled, not surprisingly, Doonesbury, which will open on Broadway in November after making its debut at Boston's Wilbur Theater.


The musical, in which Trudeau finally lets his characters come of age, takes place in Walden, an off-campus house, during commencement ceremonies. Duke and Honey will return from China and Joanie from the Congressional rat race in order to see the gang graduate. The show features such future musical classics as "It's the Right Time to Be Rich," "Rahy Room Roogat Hoy" and "Muriel and the Topsider."


Doonesbury the musical is not Trudeau's first foray into show business. His animated film "A Doonesbury Special" was nominated for an Academy Award. And he is currently at work on one screenplay about the White House press corps and another about the New Right.


Are there political overtones or cryptic social statements hidden within the latest Trudeau creation? Trudeau's press agent thinks not. But he believes "it might have a special appeal to college students. It's about facing the real world."
