I read John Knowles' A Separate Peace 
as a freshman in high school. I don't 
remember much about it except that it 
had one of those sentimental endings 
where someone dies and the reader is 
supposed to reflect on the frailty of life 
and the traj;~;edy of youth cut off in its 
prime. I remember finding Knowles~ 
reminiscences of his life as a student at 
Exeter (renamed the Devon school in 
his novel) to be especially tedious. The 
students were so smug and happy, and 
the author treated them so reverently. 
I can still recall the disdain I felt as a 
freshman at a small high school in 
Texas for this East Coast prep school 
mentality which seemed to think so 
much of itself and to be so remote from 
life as I knew it. 

Now I am a senior at Yale, a nd I've 
just finished reading A Stolen Past, 
Knowles' most recent novel, which 
came out in July. I enjoyed this fic-
tional memoir about Knowles' days as 
an undergraduate at Yale. I found 
myself identifying frequently with the 
characters in the novel as they tried to 
make sense ·eut of Yale. I recognized 
their insecurities; I saw their vulnera-
bilities. I knew their pleasure and I felt 
their pain. 

fve changed a Jot since I read A 
&paraU Peace in high school. Yale and 
all of the things that an Ivy education 
once meant to me are no longer some-
thing foreign and elitist. They are a 
part of me now, for better or worse. I 
enjoyed A Stolm Pait, but I'm left 
wondering what they'll make of it back 
in Texas. 

Much of the arrogant idealization of 
the East Coast establishmt>nt is still 
there. Knowles occasionally writes as if


Yale were the New J erusalem. The 
campus he desqibes is adorned with a 
sense of destiny. The buildings are 
monumental a nd the people are ef-
fervescent. Even swimming practice 
takes on an aura of great importance:

As one friend of mine remarked when I 
showed him the book I was reading, 
"This is the kind of thing that makes 
people want to firebomb Yale." 

But if you look past these heavy-
handed descriptions, you'll find A Stolen 
PtlSl is a finely crafted a nd compelling 
novel about a writer·trying to come to 
terms with himself. Knowles wants to 
tell us who he is a nd how he got there. 
His narrative is full of parallels with his 
own life so that the author is never very 
far from the story he is telling. His 
penetration into the mind of an under-
graduate at 'Yale is remarkable if only 
for the clarity and elegance of his prose 
and his mastery of the complex multi-
ple narratives with which he tells his 
story. 

Knowles writes in the guise of Allan 
Prieston, a middle-aged and highly 
successful writer who returns to Yale in 
1980 for the first time since he was a 
student there in the early 1950's. 
Prieston has been asked to give a lec-
!ure on one of his popular novels which 
•s taught in high school curriculums 
across the country (much like A &parau 
PNCe). Once he is settled into his room 
in the Pierson Slave Quarters, he 
meets an old friend named Millicent 
MoncrieiT. She remarks upon how 
much he has changed since his days as 
an undergraduate and asks him what 
he_has given up as he has grown older. 
~r•eston is unable to answer the ques-
tion, so he resurrects the memories of 
his days at Yale in seart·h of an answer. 
His thoughJs first turn to his room-
mate Gregory Trouvenskoy, the son of 
Russian aristocrats and a relative of 
the deposed Czar Nicholas II. Trouv-
enskoy is haunted by his family's 
former wealth and privilege. H e finds 
himself uneasy about the prospect of 
trying to be a successful American 
when his family heritage is so deeply 
rooted in an aristocratic past. Once at 
the pinnacle of Russian society, the 
Trouvenskoys were 
forced to sell 
everything they had brought with them 


from Russia to put Gregory through 
Yale. Now all that remains of their 
former wealth is a large diamond given 
to Gregory's mother by the Czar 
himself. 

But one day that diamond is stolen, 
and the Trouvenskoys' life is thrown 
into disarray. They had been saving 
the diamond to provide some security 
for the future and to serve as a tangible 
link with their past. Its theft was a 
break with that history, a "stolen past" 
if you will. Now Gregory will have to 
support the family himself without the 
help of the money they had counted on 
from the eventual sale of the diamond. 

A large portion of the novel revolves 
around Prieston's development as a 
writer. W hen he isn't telling us the 
story of the diamond theft, he is 
reminiscing about Reeves Lockhart, 
his old English teacher and mentor. 
Lockhart was a forceful personality 
and a dramatic lecturer in addition to 
being a world famous author of several 
plays and novels (see side bar). The 
character is at least loosely based on 
Thornton Wilder, the Pulitzer Prize-
winning author of Our Town and a pro-
fessor of English at Yale in the 194,0's 
and 50's. Knowles has acknowledged 
his indebtedness to Wilder elsewhere. 

Through the use of multiple nar-
ratives, Knowles also gives us some in-
• sights 
into the various stages of 
awareness that an author goes through 
at different points in his career. The 
young Allan Prieston is timid and in-
secure. His prose is self-conscious and 
overly introspective. The middle-aged 
Allan Prieston is wise and in control of 
his craft. He is learning to understand 
himself and those around him. The ag-
ing Reeves Lockhart, already ac-
claimed and world-renowned as he 
nears 60, has refused to publish any of 
his later works. He has run out of 
things to say and has turned overly 
critical of himself. He warns Prieston 
that someday he too will run out of 
things to say. 

Lockhart 
gives Prieston 
much 
valuable advice on his writing which he 
shares with us. He tells Prieston "there 
must be an eie.ment of play in all good 
writing," adding that "it's hard to im-
agine Shakespeare feeling playful while 
writing King Lear but on a certain level 
he must have been." He advises 
Prieston to be less indulgent in his 
prose and to try harder to understand 
other people. 

Perhaps the most encouraging ad-
vice that he gives to Prieston is that as 
he grows up, his work will also mature. 
Prieston takes that advice to heart by 
waiting to write the story of his days at 
Yale until he is mature enough to 
understand how they have affected 
him. When he does do so 30 years
