Von Staden: "If there were a ghost, it would be benign. And 
isn't it the non-benign kind we hear from?" 
22 The New J ournal/October 21, 1983 
with the cemetery's management. A 
desperate shortage of cadavers appears 
to have driven Yale medical students to 
grave robbery. In the ensuing furor, 
New Haven rioters broke every win-
dow in the Medical School, which 
stood where Becton Center is today. 
According to legend the Med School 
had constructed a series of tunnels 
underneath Prospect Street into the 
graveyard to facilitate the fresh flow of 
cadavers. But the details of this early 
19th century scheme still remain, if 
one 
will 
pardon 
the 
expression, 
shrouded in m ystery. 


Currently Yale's major interaction 
with the cemetery occurs once a year 
when variou s secret societies conduct 
initiation rites. "They always ask per-
mission, 
though," says Cameron. 
"Sometimes they leave a few candles 
around. We don't really ask them what 
they do." During one initiation scandal 
in the 1860s stories were told of several 
freshmen who were forced to lie buried 
in the graveyard. Nothing was proven, 
although the popularity of freshman 
fraternities began to wane not long 
afterward. 


Heinrich Von Staden, M aster of 
Stiles College, regretfully noted that 
despite a rededication of Stiles's grave-
stone two years ago, no rumblings 
have been heard from Stiles's grave. "If 
there were •.a ghost, it would be 
benign," he commented. "And isn't it 
usually the non-benign kind we hear 
from?" 


It does seem that the Puritans and 
worthy citizens who populate Crove 
Street must have died almost uniform-
ly at peace with themselves because 
most of the time ghosts are not a prob-
lem at Grove Street. Bill Cameron 
should know. He sometimes has to 
spend the night there on Halloween. 
"Have to keep a lookout for vandals. 
You know, kids who want to come and 
knock over tombstones because it's Oc-
tober 31st." Cameron isn't scared on 


those nights. "I only feel a little tense at 
first. All that stuff they tell you when 
you're a kid sticks with you. I don't 
think I'd be scared if I did see a ghost. 
I'd be more afraid of someone who was 
alive." 


Vandals do pose a more serious 
problem for the cemetery grounds-
keeper than ghosts. It is not uncom-
mon for Cameron to find a pushed-
over gravestone or a broken statue on a 
Monday morning. Aside from grave 
desecration of this sort, there have also 
been a number of muggings and one 
attempted rape reported within the last 
several years. While no incidents have 
been recorded recently, the cemetery is 
still not considered safe after twilight, 
and most Yale students tend to keep 
away unless they're looking for trouble 
or a late-night adventure. 


"It's all from the same source- the van-
dals, the people who don't care about 
cemeteries any 
more," complains 
Malcolm 
Munson, 
cemetery's 
superintendent. "They've all lost a 
sense of history that people back then 
had. If you love history, you love your 
l~t mily and vour past. Mmlt-rn lift' got•s 
too f~sst. Fmnilit·s hrt'ak up. Childrt>n 
kavt•. No ont' stays." Tht' sunlight 
gkams ofT Munson's glasses. Ht', at 
least. is staying. 


A quiet gentleman in his 70s, Mal-
colm Munson has worked at Grove 
Street for over 50 years and claims to 
know everything about it except the 
exact number of people buricd there. 
He sees to the financial and ollicial side 
of the cemetery's operation rather than 
its physical upkeep. 
His offke is 
sparse, functional. On one wall hangs 
a large map of the cemetery with each 
plot owner's name on it. In tht· corner 
stands a wooden cabinet containing the 
remains of the cemetery records. 


Munson explains that running a 
cemetery involves a certain amount of 
flexibility. Two weeks ago, for in-
stance, then· was a wedding held in 
Grove Street. A wedding in a ceme-
tery? "Actuallv it was quit·e nit·e," 
recalls Munson. Even a simple burial 
can involve complications for Munson. 
"Everyone wants to have the funeral 


his own way. They all have their own 
traditions. I suppose at bottom they're 
all the· -;am<'.n While- Grovt' Stn·c·t'o; in· 
habitants are mostly white Christians. 
there are several Jewish graves and 
even a few blacks. "We had a .Jewish 
burial last week," said Munson. "It was 
no different. Only different words." 


Funerals today are drastically dif-
ferent from those held in Grove Street 
in the 19th century. "Wine or spirits" 
were customarily served until 1826. 
The deceased were carried to the grave 
on the shoulders of several pallbearers, 
and bells tolled for every burial until 
1830. Funerals were also much more 
likely to be important social occasions. 
"People died younger then, so death 
was much more a part of daily life," ex-
plains Munson. "You see many ex-
amples of husbands with more than 
one wife simply because women were 
much more likely to die in childbirth. 
You can also tell which were the plague 
' years because whole families will have 
died within a month of each other." 


One of Bill Cameron's favorite 
places is the cemetery's northwest cor-
ner where the tombstones from the 
original buriaJ ground on the Green 
lean along the waJI. The stones were 
first moved by YaJe students and set up 
in order of prestige outside Center 
Church. When they were again moved 
to Grove Street around 1800. they 
were arranged in alphabetical ordl·r. 
"See what 1 mean?" Cameron shakes 
his head. "After a while everybody 
ends up in the same place." 


Changes in lifestyle and values from 
New Haven's earliest years are par-
ticularly evident in these older stones. 
Very few modern day druggists c·njoy 
the locaJ fame of Daniel Atwater, who 
died in 
1777. He was a "noted 
Apothecary, "a valuable member of 
society, just and upright in his deal-
ings, generaJiy beneficent to the poor, 
a kind and honorable husband." Mrs. 
Sarah Daggett's descendants said simp-
ly, "Her character is found in Proverbs 
XXXI : 10: 11." That's the verse that 
reads, "Who can find a virtuous 
woman? Her price is above rubies." 


Few women did not contain some 
measure of"virtue," "amiability" or, at 
the very least, "resignation." Yet most 
women were buried in the plots of their 
husbands and under smaller and less 
ornate tombstones.
