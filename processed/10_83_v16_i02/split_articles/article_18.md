**Afterthought: Swimming With the Big Fish**

On the· second-to-last wee_k :I was living in Washington, I 
experienced an epiphany: I found myself at an early even-
ing publication party for a,n editor I knew, sipping chablis. 
out of a fishbowl-sized 'wineglass, blinking every five 
minutes at the array of oysters and crab legs. Surrounded 
by colleagues from The New Republic, the magazine wh<:>re I 
was interning, I chatted with the Washin.f!ton Pnst reporter 
covering the event, a friend who like me had just graduat<·d 
from Yale. Everyone was at case and at home in the social 
scene. Suddenly a wave of tension swept over the crowd, 
causing many of us to stifle a gasp. Henry Kissinger had 
arrived. 

· I d idn't speak with him. After all, he was monopolized 
by two congressmen, an editor and the White House cor-
respo~dent for The New York Times. But even so, there we 
all were hanging out at The Palm on 19th Street NW. In a 
strange way, for two hours we were all equals, drinking the 
same wine and chomping on the same seafood. At that 
point I began to understand just how much, as a Yalic 
Washington Intern (YWI), I was living a dream. And after 
recovering from the wine in the fishbowl, I decided that it 
wasn't necessarily a good dream either. 

Washington is itself a fishbowl- everybody's looking at 
everybody else, looking for leverage, for a chance shoulder-
rubbing which could pay off later· on. Interns are status-
conscious; for YWI's, status is obtained usually with no 
more discernible effort than the legwork it takes to get a 
resume typeset at Tyco. One soon learns that credentials 
and connections are everything, and Yale provides you 
with a ready-made set. My Georgetown housesitting ar-
rangement, for example, a cushy deal with a car and a 
phone answering machine, was procured by my YWI 
roommate through friends of friends of friends. 

Upon moving into the plush surroundings, among the 
first things I discovered was a document called the Social 
Register-essentially a listing or rich people, whom they 
married, the clubs they belong to and the schools they at-
tended. I immediately began searching for Yalies I knew, 
found a few I expected to be in there and a few I did not. 
My name, alas, wasn't in there, but for some reason I 
almost wished it were. Once you feel yourself being con-
sumed by the "Washington scene,". it's hard to face the fact 
that you really may not belong after all. Many hunger to 
overcome this self doubt. 

"Interns are carnivorous creatures," wrote Robin Davis 
(herself an intern) in a piece in The New Republic last 
September, "and in the summer Washington is crawling 
with thousands of interns hell-bent on devouring every-
thing in s-ight." Each June an entire intern sub-culture 
springs up with its own social life and its own rules. Prox-
imity to power is the most valued commodity, what pro-
vides you with a name to drop and, many hope, the 
knowledge to climb Capitol Hill later in life. An internship 
spent running errands for your congressman far outranks 
doing research for the Congressional Quarterly. 

Yalies are led to believe they'll own the world within a 
given time after graduation- say 20 years, maybe 30 for 
the less ambitious. Upon arrival in Washington, suddenly 
you find yourself at cocktail parties with Henry Kissinger, 
and the 20 years conn·ptually ('()llapst> to nothirtg. Obvious-
ly you an· more lowly than Ht•nry. Kissingt·r, but t•veryone 
surrounding you is on a paralld track to a hight·r position, 
hobnobbing with people like him. Being an intern wht·ts 
your appt·tite f(>r more oysters ancl crab legs down th<· line; 
you start to exaggerate your own sizt' in tht· fishbowl. 

Anyom·'s initial r<'aetion, mine anyway. is. "Oh wow. Isn't 
this amazing." After the starry-eyt·d shock wears off. the 
st·condary rt·action might as well be, "I belong hen·; these 
arc my pt•opk." 

Rut somehow all these pt•ople, in Georget<.>wn at kast 
st>em to he blonde and wearing khaki shorts. Thne is a 
disturbing provincialism about this place. a cit-y that afl'<Tts 
so much of the world. A qm·stion arises: is it possibk to 
g<>Vern cflcrtively if you hav<' nt'vt•r left tht• Eastern 
Establishment's Boston-to-Washington corridor? Is Wash-
ington in fact the natural tnminus of the universe. the 
plat·e where all roads kad? And if so, is tht•n· nothing 
wmng with taking the short t·ut from New Hav<·n and fall-
ing in loY<' with tht• place since toughing it out at Yak f(>r 
four years seems to land a lot of people there as it is? 

Like Yale, Washington is a meta-reality. It is an artifi<·ial 
world whnc tht· path~ pf the powerful intersect. Evt•rything 
has a sheen of importance, that of politics and power in-
stead of academia. Ytiu can st•t• it burning n·stlessly in the 
<'yes of many intans and stallers on Capitol Hill : a hungry 
look of pious self-importance based ultimately on not much 
mort· than brains and a few months' experi<·n<'<' in a local 
law firm. 

When you're exposed to constant committee lwarings 
and prt•ss <·overage, important ckcision-making and q~o­
massage. how hard it is to t'<'IIH'lllht:r that I ht..-e is indeed 
Sonlt'thing Ebw. Yak, ckspite its atmospht'IT of privilege 
and compt·tition, stresses ahovt• those things the valut•s of 
learning, of the "liberal education." In Washington the mis-
sion is to govern, and that means different ground rules. 
Sclf-;nterest is the motivating fon-c of politics. Values are 
largely an individual matter, and if you're pushing 20 
they're espec-ially hard to find in a place dominated hy 
political buzzwords. 

When the staff writer at my magazine, who was a yntr 
older than I, decided it was time to move on, he had a 
t·hoicc between two job offers. The first was with a 
newspaper in New Orleans, the se<"nnd as a spt•echwriter 
for Walter Mondale. Both paid the same. Evt•ryhody in tht· 
office urged him to go with Fritz. After all, working on a 
national political campaign that could land you in the 
White House is nothing to he tossed off idly. After days 
spent agonizing, he decided to abandon the fishbowl and 
the haunts of Henry Kissinger and "go south and do honest 
work," in the words of another adviser. He may eventually 
return to Washington, hut in the meantime thert• is 
something to be said for the "honest work" of the circuitous 
route.
