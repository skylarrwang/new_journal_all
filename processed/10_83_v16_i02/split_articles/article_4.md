EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
For Demetrius looked on Hermia's face.
He hailed down oaths that he was only true,
And when this hail fell from Hermia's face,
So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did fall.
And we study these lines because they are true.
I.e. we can be like that.
Can't it?


The first time my humanities professor at KU pointed out truth in art, I was stunned. It was the place in the Odyssey where the old nurse tucks the sleeping Telemachus into bed. After reading the passage in a slow somber way, he asked us if we remembered when our mothers used to tuck us in with the same "gentle fold" of the blanket.


If a Yale professor were to say such a thing on the record, he would be brought before the Committee of Undocumented Citations and asked to explain himself. But at KU the pastures are green and the cows easygoing, so the professor got away with it. And to be sure, his point was not a sentimental one at all, but simply this: that many lines from great books, often the most inane details or digressions, depict a part of our common human experience.


I anticipate the following objection: "Granted that appreciation of truth and beauty is the main end of art. But doesn't analysis play a role in art criticism, and isn't that at least partly what we're here at Yale to do?"


Analysis does play a role. You can't help it. After the electric moment your mind instinctively goes back and pores over the questions why and how.


But in the end the purpose of closer study should not be simply to dissect; quite the contrary. Analysis must highlight the truth and beauty of the art just as the art itself attempts to highlight these qualities in human experience. We should strive for a pulling together rather than a pulling apartâ€”a union of art with the human experience it depicts.


In presenting, for example, the above passage from Shakespeare, my professor at KU would not have assumed that the words reflected reality for the class. Rather, he would have encouraged us to test them against our own lives. In what ways had our experience of love been as Helena described it in her metaphor? In turn, the professor might have consulted the standards of Plato or St. Paul: maybe Helena isn't talking about love at all, but rather infatuation.


Such comparisons of art to life greatly enhanced not only our appreciation of art, but also our understanding of life. In the humanities, the integration of the whole is greater than the analysis of its parts.


"But is this analysis at all?" Indeed it is. It is the analysis that is partner to synthesis, the inductive analysis of the visionary who brings together seemingly unrelated areas of reality and says "Aha!" In this sense Walt Whitman and Albert Einstein were equally great scientists.


When, however, a professor simply dissects art (or history or philosophy), when he analyzes the part of humanity in isolation from the whole, he does what even the scientist tries to avoid: he conducts an "in vitro" examination. He treats the subject as if it were its own universe devoid of significance outside its complex interior relationships. He does so whether he applies the dissection to individual works or whole genres. In either case the result is the same: the work or genre is made relevant only to itself, not to the human beings who are studying it.


To do justice to Yale, I should note that many professors recognize the deficiency of analysis divorced from human feelings or experience. When I finished my two years in the program at KU, I returned warily for a week-long visit. One professor I spoke with sympathized with my views but asked, "How else can we know whether students have understood what they have read?" Another, concurring, added that lack of student preparation made for much of the pointless connections drawn in English 129 discussions and that teachers were being pulled into the web. Another professor said she was surprised by my concern over lack of true appreciation because, as she put it, "That's just assumed."


These professors would do well to heed the words of Robert Frost: "The figure a poem makes . . . begins in delight and ends in wisdom." By emphasizing the intermediary stage of analysis and assuming prior delight, teachers can leave us aimless wanderers of the grey neuro-synapse network somewhere between Frost's two psychic ideals.


I finally decided to return to Yale not for these demurrals, but for certain practical considerations: it was the only place open to me with all the opportunities, resources and varying stimuli of a high-powered university. Based on these criteria, my decision was a sound one.


Nevertheless, my enjoyment of courses over the last year was seldom enhanced by active encouragement of delight on the part of my professors. This is the area where a small change could precipitate a renaissance. Yale students, realizing the problem, could make their desires and dissatisfactions known to great effect. Faculty in turn could reassess their role in undergraduate humanities courses. Is the teacher the head anatomist or a catalyst of delight, friendship and the integration of the humanities with the human experience they depict?

At Yale we line them up like so many cadavers.
