South 'Africans that there are. They 
are inclined to say that you路 did what 
we did. Give us time to work through 
our problem in the way you worked 
through yours. 

In my mind the most important 
matter where there must stop being 
any kind of comparison is that the 
basic thrust of the federal government 
in the United States has almost always 
been toward enforcing civil rights: 'lt 
was 
the central government that 
ultimately forced the Southern states to 
abandon segregation. The thrust in 
South Africa is exactly the reverse, 
Whenever a local community wishes to 
desegregate, when a province would 
like, in fact, to change the law, the 
federal government forces them to 
adhere to the basic canons of the 
Afrikaner 'ideology. 

Don't forget, in a population of 30 
million, 23.5 million are black and 
another four million are Indian and 
Colored. So the whites see themselves 
as enormously threatened by any con-
cepts of "one man, one vote." 

TNJ :. In my opinion the Afrikaner 
ideology seems far closer to that of 
Nazis than that of the American 
slaveholders and their segregationist 
descendants. While slavery in America 
was in conflict with our national ethos 
of equality and liberty, in South Africa 
whites have portrayed themselves as 
ordained by God to rule blacks. They 
see themselves as a m .~ster race, blacks. 
as a subordinate race, and that's the 
way God intended it. 

RW: I'm not really happy in compar-
ing the South Africans to the Nazis, 
though it's a nearer comparison.than to 
the plantation South. But the Nazi 
ideology was for the removal of the 
Jews and the other people defined as 
undesirablP.. It was not to create a 
nredlclalm~.

cheap labor force. And in South Africa 
that's the goal. They want predictive 
capacity over a labor force by control-
ling the price of labor, its productivity 
levels and its residence. And that's 
really a different goal than that of the 
Nazis. They may be using Nazi meth-
ods for that goal, but it's a different 
goal. 

I'm not sure that a great number of 
white South Africans any longer would 
defend apartheid on the grounds that 
God ordained it. One of the differences 
I think I detect in these ten years since 
my first visit is a shift toward more 
hard-headed secular defenses. There is 
a movement, for example, in the 
D utch Reformed Church which has 
produced a book called Apartheid is a 
Heresy. These church leaders are argu-
ing that there is nothing to be found in 
the Bible that suggests that apartheid 
was fixed by God. What they are argu-
ing is that it was brought into being for 
particular social goals, and to some ex-
tent those social goals have already 
been achieved, and therefore there is 
no basis for apartheid. 

TNJ: What is your comment on the ef-
fect or desirability of boycotts by artists 
or professionals in pressuring South 
Africa- its 
government and 
its 
1 路citizens- to change their practices? 

RW: I think by and large the boycott is 
not very significant. To begin with a 
fair number of white performers go to 
South Arrica anyway. Secondly many 
performers who do not go because of 
the bovr.ott are the kind that at least the 
Afrikaner community feel they don't 
wish to hear anyway. They play loud 
noisy music, they're living Godless 
lifestyles and the boycott is simply 
playing into the hands of the right wing 
and fundamentalist religious element 
who would wish to find some other 
means to bar what they like to think of 
as undesirable artistic influence. 

I think the one area where the 
boycott has had real effect is athletics. 
There's no question that the politics of 
sports is much more significant in 
South Africa than in most countries. 
O ne of the e~~ouraging breakthroughs 
that occurred while I was there was 
when, as a prelude to an international 
soccer match, or rugby match, the 
main 
all-white high school of the 
Cape Town area played against the 路 
main non-white high school. There 
had never been an interracial match on 
the high school level. What is signifi-
cant is that not only was there a huge 
crowd, interracial, but though the 
press anticipated that this white team 
was going to wipe these much smaller 
people off the field, the Indian and 
C olored team won the game. As they 
began to win the game with a more 


daring style. of play, the entire au -
dience began to root for them. T here 
was no sense of racial antipathy, no 
sense that the whites fundamentally 
felt that the white team had to win, 
because what they were seeing was a 
better style of play. As a good friend of 
mine 
remarked, "Maybe the fun-
damental politics of apartheid in this 
country will turn on sports." 

TNJ: Yale students are organizing a 
new committee to combat apartheid on 
campus, and they are going to recon-
sider the issue of disinvestment of 
university holdings in South African 
enterprises. In your opinion what is 
the value of disinvestment as a tactic to 
express disapproval of apartheid? 

RW: I think it makes those who join in 
such committees feel good. So I think 
such committees are a good thing. I 
also路 think that they don't have any ef-
fect whatsoever on apartheid. If such 
committees are formed on the assump-
tion that they're going to bring apar-
theid crumbling to the ground, then I 
think that the people involved in them 
will be very frustrated. It's rather like 
the liquor store dealers of Connecticut 
taking Russian vodka off the shelf. I 
am sure this is a good public relations 
gesture toward the consumers, but I 
do not think that the Soviet Union is 
going to worry that because they shot 
down a Korean airliner, we're not go-
ing to drink their vodka. 

As I said at the outset, I think the 
historian must go and see for himself. 
It's very wrong to condemn a society 
which you've' never examined. So 
when I said I was compromising 
myself, I didn't mean to say that I felt 
dirty because I had gone to South 
Africa, but there is no doubt as you 
look out a streamlined train at the 
shanty towns you're passing by, you 
have to recognize that you are in a 
streamlined train because there are 
shanty towns out there. There is a real 
cause and effect between the two. So it 
was good to es<"ape from that sense of 
moral discomfort.
