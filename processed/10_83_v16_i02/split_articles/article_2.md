EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
More than Money
To the Editor: 
Though genuinely intrigued by your 
point of view in "Troubadors, Inc.: 
The W hiffenpoofs of 75," I wish to 
contest several aspects of the art ide in 
the hope of contributing to a broader 
evaluation of the nature of the grQup. 

First of all your presentation of the 
size and composition of our annual 
budget (the numbers for which you at-
tribute in quotation to me) is incorrect. 
G iven that our group ('83) performed 
over 200 times during the year, had we 
averaged S 1000 a concert and had 
private donors supplied us with an ad-
ditional "six figures," our revenues 
would have been well over $300,000 
for the ·year. In fact our budget was 
well under $90,000, and only $10,000 
of that was the result of private dona-
tions. Record sales made up another 
$15,000. 

Secondly I contest the dramatic im-
portance you place on 'the group's be-
ing an incorporated non-profit entity. 
This step was initiated by the 1982 
group to insure that the WhifTenpoofs' 
income was appropriately earned and 
spent in the eyes of the IRS. Having 
been a Whiff business manager whose 
obsession it was to always keep us out 
of the red, no one should have taken 
our "business" more seriously than I, 
and that is why I am so troubled in 
general by the tone of your anicle. I 
feel that your misleading portrayal of 
both the numbers involved and of our 
incorporation causes one to lose sight 
of what I perceive to be the real nature 
of the group. 

Having been in existence now for 75 
years, the WhifTenpoofs have gained a 
reputation which in turn means the 
group is sought out very often. But I 
don't think 
we're 
the "lingering 
anachronism" you would make us. The 
mere fact that there are so many other 
very business-like singing groups on 
campus doing the same kind of thing 
we're doing is proof enough that our 
style and our music are a contem-
porary reality. 

Sincerely, 
Rob Carter

Clarification
·To the Editor: 
I note that the lead article in the 
September 9, 1983, issue of The New 
journal contains the allegation that a 
letter written by me on behalf of the 
Whiffenpoofs of 1983 was "forged." I 
would like to assure all those concerned 
that I did indeed write the letter in 
question, and no forgery of any kind 
was involved. In addition, the secre-
tary responsible for forwarding the let-
ter had at that time the initials R.M.C. 
With best wishes, 
Sincerely yours, 
A. Bartlett Giamatti

Editor's note: Business Manager Rob Carter 
still claims he wrote the letter in question. He 
says he showed it to Giamatti for his 
signature and approval bifore it appeared in 
the ·Whijfenpoof 74th anniversary album.


Humanism's Reprise
Mike Otsuka's article "Beneath The 
Liberal Facade" is a sad example of the 
extremist rhetoric that preoccupies 
those on both enos of Yale's political 
spectrum. He states that "it will still re-
quire a fair amount of ingenuity for 
thoughtful liberals to preserve their 
ideology and the sincerity of their 
beliefs while at Yale." It may come as a 
surprise to Mr. Otsuka that not every-
one has a fixed conception of the world 
before arriving at Yale. Some of us are 
searching for and exploring ideas 
rather than trying to preserve intact 
some ideology miraculously handed 
down from the mount. 

Mr. Otsuka ·l!mbarrasses himself 
when he generalizes that "in the class-
rooms, the Old World overshadows the 
New World and the Third World." His 
Blue Book is either missing a few hun-
dred pages, or he is consciously 
denigrating professors like Morgan 
and Spence and the countless courses 
dealing with the New and Third 
Worlds. H e continues that "much of 
what is considered worth teaching and 
remembering was produced decades or 
centuries ago on a small plot of land 
which extends from G reece to France 
and north to Britain." You're dam n

right it is! Understanding that small 
plot- Western civilization- is the key 
to understanding tht> modern world, 
New a nd Third Worlds included. To 
deny the importance and relevance in 
1983 of European culture and history 
may be chic with Mr. Otsuka's friends , 
but it is a rather narrow and ignorant 
viewpoint. 

The final idea I must dispute is Mr. 
Otsuka's assertion that we are "indulg-
ing" ourselves in a liberal arts educa-
tion "at a significant cost to society." 
Obviously he missed a few crucial 
Econ 
11 5 
lectures on cost-benefit 
analysis. Although not easily quan-
tified, the benefits of turning over to 
society every year more than 1,200 
well-trained minds, each with about 
60 good years o f usc left, is a priceless 
legacy to the future.

Artistic Radicalism
While reading "Beneath the Liberal 
Facade," (TN.f, September 9, 1983) I 
was struck by one major omission Mike 
Otsuka made in his attempt to define 
Yale as a purely conservative institu-
tion. Any reference to the fine arts as a 
radicalizing innuem·c on culture was 
glaringly absent. Beyond politics, be-
yond accusations of elitism, the univer-
sity has always promoted fn:t·dom of 
expression 
in 
music, 
1n 
art, 
10 
literature. 

To ignore the impa< t of < reative 
renegades (the arti<>t i< mavericks who 
cuatt fads and trends, instead of 
passively 
following 
tht.•m) 
IS 
to 
misunderstand the -.cry nature of 
society. 

Yale 
as an 
institution builds 
character, groom s leaders- <tnd the 
leaders in art , musi< and literature are 
those who dart> to be different, those 
who stand apart from the crowd. Our 
university hac; never em·ouragcd con-
formity. Rather it is internal pressure, 
a psychological fear of n.· jection, that 
breeds conformist behavior. That, to 
me, is true consl·rvatism -a com-
pulsive need to cling to the past, a fear 
of change. Viewed in this respect, Yale 
is one of the most radical places on 
earth.

Vapid Propaganda
To the Erlitor: 
Laura Pappano's "Beasts of Burden" 
(TN] 9/9/83) typifies the unquestion-
ing approach of mainstream jour-
nalism to the thorny issues- scientific, 
moral and political- that 
attend 
animal experimentation. As such, it 
stands as a vapid propaganda piece 
that trumpets the value of animal 
models to medical research and fosters 
the myth of researcher concern for the 
pain and death of the animals in ques-
tion. 

Regarding the value of animal 
models, we must not assume their use 
has been an unqualified benefit to 
humankind. After all, we have been 
plagued by the horrors of thalidomide, 
DES, TRIS, Deproprovera and diox-
in, to name only a few, precisely 
because their manufacturers were able 
to show safety in animal models. Since 
humans are not dogs or cats or rabbits, 
the tests on these animals weren't in 
truth applicable to the human condi-
tion. T he fallibility can also cut the 
other way: If for example the use of 
penicillin had to depend on animal 
tests to be proven safe a nd effective, 
penicillin would never have entered 
the market, for it is toxic to the prime 
species of test animals. 

Is there an alternative? Non-animal 
tests such as computer and mathema-
tical models of biological systems and 
human cell and/or tissue cultures offer 
a sensible one in many cases, as they 
do not require data derived from one 
species to be applied to another.
