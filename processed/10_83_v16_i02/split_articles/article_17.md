EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
later, the narrative shows the depth of 
his greater understanding. 

The passage of 30 years has, in fact, 
given Knowles a perspective on Yale 
he didn't have as an undergraduate. As 
an alumnus returning to Yale, he sees 
privilege that he had not realized ex-
isted when he was an undergraduate. 
He describes this new awareness quite 
_subtly by juxtaposing Yale ard the 
American elite with the family of the 
fallen R ussian aristocrats. At one point 
G regory makes fun of the Yale insignia 
on Allan's bathrobe, '"What if I wore 
the R omanoff double eagle,' he scoffed, 
'on my ski parka?'" 
Maturity docs 
bring a 
greater 
awareness of who we are and where 
we've been. I was as green as Allan 
Prieston when I read A Separate Peace in 
high school. I've grown up a lot since 
then, and I now understand that child-
hood does, in fact, end. I signed A 
Separate Peace out of the library recently, 
and I found that I really liked it. The 
tragedy of youth's passing is no longer 
incomprehensible to me. But only with 
the passing of time and the gaining of 
maturity could I recognize the power 
of this book's simple message. 

In the end Prieston realizes that the 
transition from young student to ac-
complished writer has hardened him. 
H e finally answers the question that 
M illicent Monc·ricff asked him: What 
have you given up to get where you are 
today?

K nowles offers this final insight into 
his craft: 

Writers 
tell 
stories; 
sometimes their own, sometimes some-
one else's. They are not afraid to steal. 
They are not afraid to rummage 
through the past and resurrect unplea-
sant memories -like the theft of the 
T rouvenskoys' 
diamond. They are 
not afraid to take these stories and 
claim them for their own. After all, 
what is a novel but a stolen past?
