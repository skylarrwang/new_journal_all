about 15 shows a year in America and 
Canada. At one show last year, he sold 
a national champion White W yan 
Dotte Bantam hen for 
$200 and 
another 160 chickens for a total of 
$700. 

Gromacki's already thinking about 
law school these days, but he is ob-
viously devoted to his llock. "I'd like to 
keep the busin(!SS going so that I can 
come back to my birds after college," 
says Gromacki. "My grandmother says · 
I have poultry farming in m y blood." 

EVEN IF SKIP KLEIN DIDN'T 
know the ingredients in a cinnamon-
raisin bagel, that wouldn't have stop-
ped him from trying to sell it. When he 
was at Yale, Klein was always the-
organizer. He was the idea man, the 
entrepreneurial· spark behind such 
ventures as Boola-Bagels and The 
Great American Heroes Film Society. 
He worked with Rob Glaser as the 
marketing wizard in Ivy Research, a 
computer sofiware company at Yale. 
Although his 
100-page 
economics 
thesis on Yale's endowment portfolio 
has served as a useful and original 
document on Yale's 
investment 
policies, Klein had a rocky time as an 
undergraduate entrepreneur. 

NoWhe is earninR a Ph.D . in Bus-
iness and Economics/MBA and mak-
ing big plans for a future in investment 
management. In a few years he wants 
to form a small investment manage-
ment firm with five other Yalies that 
will handle individua~ portfolios rather 
than pension funds. "It's a pipe dream , 
he admits "but it's certainly within the 
realm of possibility." 

As freshmen, Klein and his room -
mates engineered the construction of 
the world's largest bagel as a publicity-
garnering event for Boola Bagels, a 
bagel dC"Iivery service. Neither 60 
pounds of dough nor clever slogans like 
"Lox et veritas" could save the faltering 
venture. The 
business had only 
managed to pay its masterminds a 
wage of $1.00/hr. 

Klein's next venture was no more 
successful. Seeing the success of the 
James Bond Film Society, Klein and 
his roommates created The Great 
American Heroes Film Society, which 
showed Clint Eastwood and W ood y 
Allen films. After netting only about 
$1.00 an hour Klein left the film socie-
ty business once and for all. The 
following year, 
howeve r , 
ne w 
managers took over Spectrum Films 
and it began to turn a profit. 

Whether or not Klein was successful 
as a student en trepreneur at Yale, he 
was always a kind of spokesman for the 
cause of free enterprise on campus. 
o ften wearing a suit or a bow tie and 
talking the language of big business. In 
that respect, Klein hasn't changed a 
bit. "When you start a business, you 
find a need and address it," he says. "In 
this sense, you are serving a positive 
social function. Capitalism, really, is 
llnother form of altruism. 

"During thl· sixties people looked 
down their noses on someone who 
hustled to make a buck. Now it's sort of 
respected . It's not a crime anymore. 
Still, there an· always people who look 
down their noses at business. 'Here he 
is,' they say, 'trying to play his little 
games. 
H e's trying 
to 
be a big 
businessman .' But people began to 
realize that it's an interesting thing to 
do, something more and more respec-
table. Now they're saying, 'I wish I had 
done something like that.'" 

"YOU C AN'T WRITE A GOOD 
pop song unless it's marketable," says 
Scott Young, lead vocalist for the five-
piece, 
all-Yale 
group, 
Busload of 
Nuns. "That's the whole point of rock 
a nd roll.'' A jul')ior in Pi er<~on College, 
Young plan·s a high premium on the 
a rtistic integrity of his music. But he 
and the Nuns arc al-;o quite serious 
about breaking into the music business

that tht• clays are gone wht•n all a suc-
cessful rock and roll band had to have

recorded 
two albums, "Busload of

third. Along with recording efforts, 
the Nuns also set up an extensive 
tour of the N o rthl·a<~t t·olle~t· circuit for 
this fall. "At the collt·gcs, we ask f<lr

$600 to $600 per concert," explained 
Young. "Rut we have enough faith in 
our drawing power to ask for h<;tlf the 
money made at the door in addition." 

On O<·tober 29th, the Nuns will return 
to Berkeley College where they played 
last spring. 

Rusim·ss and art, however, don't 
mix easily for the Nuns. "You go 
through periods of moral dilemma," 
admitted Young. "I feel like I don't 
want to ht· bothned about the money 
part of it, hut tht·n I realize that it is 
important. I want to makt• a living at 
this someday." 

Although they are admittedly pre-
pmf't·ssional in their approach, the 
Nuns ft·el that they havt• an <·dge ovt:r

University Cart•t•r Services this spring. 
"Students do a lot of things here 
be<·ause they are s<·ared that they won't 
have anything to do when they leave 
school," said Mike Deneen, DC '85, 
the keyboard plavt·r for the Nuns. "I'm 
doin'g what I like to do."

WHEN 
ROLLIN 
RIGGS AND 
Bruce .Jacobsen 
got 
together 
in 
Calhoun two years ago and decided to 
put together a student guidebook to 
spring break in Florida, the two 
juniors knew next to nothing about the 
publishing business. But after comple-
ting the manuscript and submitting it 
to Arbor House in Manhattan, they 
realized that writing a book isn't all its 
cracked up to be. Among other things, 
they learned that once the contract is 
completed, it's the publisher not the 
writer who tails the shots. "We gave 
them an 'R' rated book and they turned 
it into a 'PG'," Riggs complained. 

So when the two student journalists 
got together a year later and decided to 
put out another guidebook, this time 
about Europe, they chose to go about it 
a little diiTerently: They formed their 
own publishing company. 

R.J publications in New Haven may 
not be the most prestigious publishing 
house on the planet, but for a fledgling 
firm run by two members of the class 
of 1982 it is off to a impressive start. 
Riggs and .Jacobson already have three 
books under contract. A guide to bars, 
discos and off-the-beaten-track spots in 
Europe called Europe: Where The Fun Is 
will appear this spring. It was compiled 
last summer with reports written most-
ly by Yak students on tour in Europe. 
The Cnmpltle Book of Beer Drinkin.~ will 
appear sometime next year. It prom-
ises to give complete instructions for 
over 50 drinking games, including 
Whale's Tales, 
Slush Fund, 
Beer 
Hunter and th<· infamous Thumper. 
You too can be a Dmzocratic Candidau for 
President is slated to appear next spring 
as well. 

Riggs had already distinguished 
himself as a successrul stucfent en-
trepreneur of sorts even before he a nd 
J acobsen produced The R ius of Spring: 
A Student's Guide To Spring Break . in 
Florida. 

As a 
well-known campus 
photographer, Riggs managed to sell a 
large number of his photographs to 
Time, ~ewsweek and the New York Times 
· when he wasn't shooting photos for the 
Yale Daily News and The New Journal. 
He made a small fortune off a series of 
pictures he had taken of Jodie Foster in 
the weeks followingJohn Hinckley's at-
tempted assassination of President 
Reagan. Between his photo work and 
the book, Riggs missed a lot-of classes, 
but by that time academics had 
become a second priority for him. "It's 
easier to blow off classes when you're 
paying for them," he explains. 

J acobsen, a reporter who worked for 
the 
Har~ford Courant and the Miami 
Herald, doesn't understand the qualms 
that many students have had about the 
idea of turning a profit. "People who 
make money aren't using a gun to hold 
up a bank," he says. "They are supply-
ing a product. And everything costs 
money- how do people think their tui-
tion is being paid for?" 

Riggs agrees: "I think people are just 
now waking up to the fact that m oney 
in the checking account is not neces-
sarily a bad thing. It's what you choose 
to do with that money that you can ap-
ply a moral value to. Making money is 
not necessarily exploitation. The best 
thing I can do for the world is to be a 
productive person." 

W H EN ROB GLASER GRADU-
ated last May, he had most of the Yale 
campus fooled. Just about everyone 
had him pegged as Glaser, the arch-
liberal of Yale's already decidedly 
liberal politics, the prolific author of 
"What's Left" in the Yale Daily News, 
the guy who wore a purple ribbon for 
the oppressed people of America and 
El Salvador. Glaser was the one who 
organized a student march on the 
Green against Reaganomics in 1980. 
In his four years here1 he debunked 
just about every vestige of conser-
vatism and big-business at Yale. ~u re­
ly the last thing people expected from 
Glaser was the spirit of capitalism.
