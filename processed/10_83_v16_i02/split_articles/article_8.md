**The Yale Entrepreneurs: Free Enterprise Comes of Age on Campus**
**Author: Peggy Edersheim**
**Page number(s): 14**

Take Bill Funderburke, for example. Here was a,. fairly 
unassuming student who needed to make some money for 
the parties he was throwing last year in Morse. One even-
ing when he was working on a three-page paper for an in-
vestment banking course, Funderburke struck upon the 
idea of the Beer Glove. "I was holding a beer at a party one 
·Tuesday night," he remembers, "and my hands were freez-
ing because the beer was so cold. I could have used a Beer 
Glove then, something insulated to keep my hands warm 
and·the beer cold." 


So Funderburke got $300 together, bought a few dozen 
gloves and located a silk screener to print a big blue "Y" on 
the back. He made plans to sell the gloves at keg parties, 
festivals and tailgates, and he even tried to get the name 
registered as a trademark:' After he graduated, though, 
Funderburke got involved in other things, and his Beer 
Glove died an untimely death in a cardboard box. 


Funderburke is only one example of a growing number 
of Yale students who are turning to free enterprise between 
classes. Whether they are successful or not, these people 
have an idea, and the idea is to make something out of 
nothing-for a profit. They are the Yale entrepreneurs. 


There's Dana How, a sophomore in Stiles, who used his 
computer skills to pay for his senior year at Exeter and his 
freshman year at Yale. How formulated a small data base 
program for the Apple Computer which impressed a 
distributor so much that he had it licensed. There's Jack 
Meyers, a senior in Davenport, who found an original way 
to make his commercial pilot's license profitable. He hired a 
professional photographer to fly with him in one of Yale's 
planes and take a series of aerial shots of the campus. 
l\1eyers enlarged the photographs and will soon be selling 
them as posters for $5-20, depending on size. He'll also be 
flying over the Bowl during the tOOth Anniversary of the 
Harvard-Y al4! game, taking shots to sell to alumni, parents 
and students. 


Then there's Brian Hammerstein, a Silliman senior who 
took the year off to run a small computer software opera-
tion out of his apartment in the Taft; senior Rob Morrow 
and Victor Caston who managed a small printing business 
in New Haven last summer; Mario Verdolini and Peter 
Phleger, two Silliman juniors, who started a bakery in 
Boothbay Harbor; and lvor Benjamin, '83, an MB&B Ma-
jor and a Yale rower who somehow found time to establish 
~d manage Yale Audio, a highly successf~l student agen-
cy. 


This is not to mention the dozens of students who work 
for the other more-or-less lucrative agencies and organiza-
tions on campus-like the Yale Ring Agency, Yale Student 
Laundry, Yale Cap and Gown Agency, Yale T-shirt Agen-
cy, Yale Appliance Agency and the seven film societies. 


It wasn't long ago when most students at Yale frowned 
upon this kind of home-grown capitalism, thought it was 
crass and silly and exploitative. It wasn't long ago when 
"going into business" was taken as a sign of selling out. But 
now attitudes are beginning to change. "Business as a pro-
fession is perceived far less negatively now than it was five 
years ago," says Ted Noyes, last year's director of Yale 
Career Advisory and Placement Service (now called 
University Career Services). "Two years ago, the number 
of seniors participating in the recruiting process in the 
private sector jumped by 30 percent. About 50 percent of 
the class of 1983 applied for jobs in the business world." 


Another indication of the new attitude towards business 
on campus is the recent popularity of two organizations: 
The Yale Student Investment Group (an organization of 
some 70 students who manage a portfolio of S 100,000) and 
AISEC (an international business exchange network for 
students). Initiated in 1948, Yale's AISEC chapter was one 
of the most successful in the country throughout the 1950s, 
according to the organization's president Alex McCredis. 
"But student p·articipation petered out during the Vietnam 
years when business was taboo," explains McCredis. "Then 
AISEC faded away completely. Last year, though, the pro-
grams' resurgence began, and now AISEC is as strong as 
ever." McCredis himself is something of a student entrepre-
neur- he runs a year-round sailboat 'rental business that he 
coordinates with a partner living in Greece. 


But it would be a mistake to call the new attitude toward 
business a sign of increased pre-professionalism on the 
campus. Susan Hauser, the new director of University 
Career Services, thinks the changes extend beyond Yale. 
"Attitudes have changed clearly and markedly toward 
business," says Hauser. "It has become acceptable for 
students to want to be comfortable, to quite a different 
degree than it was 10 years ago. It's orice again acceptable 
for students to wish to espouse their parents' lifestyle." 


We've selected a half dozen profiles that we think docu-
ment the turn toward free enterprise at Yale-six stories of 
student entrepreneurs who, like Joel Goodson in the now-
classic Risley Business, put their ideas together and made a 
buck ... 


**Dan Slavin: A College Junior's Ferrari**
**Page number(s): 15**

DAN SLAVIN KEEPS A POSTER 
of a red Ferrari on his wall in Morse. 
"A Ferrari is the ultimate toy," Slavin 
grins, "hut I don't think I'll buy one 
yet." H e doesn't think that a 19-ycar-
old like himself should he able to afford 
a Ferrari. Rut he can. 


Acting as a middleman between a 
few computer product suppliers and a 
handful of large customers (including 
Yale University 
Pun·basing 
Department), Slavin has managed to 
gross $10.000-$15.000 since .June. 
And now he is working on a computer 
deal whi<·h could earn him over a 
quarter of a million dollars this year. 


Not had for a colkge junior who 
spends his afternoons punting footballs 
fi1r Yak. 


But Slavin is the kind of person who 
is 
full of surprises. 
An dectrical 
engineering m~jor, Slavin is founder 
and owner of Ryt<· Computer St•rvin·s. 
which he operat<·s singlc-handt•dly out 
of his 1"<10111 in Mors<·. His hottest it<·m 
is the Maxdl Disk<·tte. which he sells 
li1r $29 (box of I 0) almost exdusivt·ly 
to hulk huv<·rs like univ<·r·sities and 
large 
firm~. Sinn· Slavin is 
self-
nnployed- and sinn• ht• has almost no 
ov<·rhead- he can un<krsdl even t ht• 
largt• mail orde1· Sl'rvin·s which adve•·-
tize tht• lowt•st pr·ices on t he market. 


Slavin's higg<·st t'XJH'rHiitun· is the 20q-
stamp ht• puts on tht• onkr· fi1rms. H t• 
doesn't even pay salt·s tax on his pur-
chases-t'V<'l'Ything he buys conH·s 
from tax-fn•t· Pennsvh-ania. 


"Now l'n1 in the .right plan· at the 
right time. and I'm capitalizing on 
that." ht• says. "Wht·n l'lll not, I'll stop 
and find sollH'thing else to do. I'm go-
ing to milk this li1r all it's worth and 
tht'll mm·t· on. Most peopk think I'm 
full of it when I talk about how nnrch 
money I'm making. Sonw peopk think 
I'm obnoxious. and 1 hey'n· right. I 
0)>1'11 II IV n11111 h too llltJ('h." 


Slavin was aln•ady an entrepreneur 
when h1· got to Yak. In his senior· year 
of high school lw made a I idy li1rllllll' 
-SOI\H' $4000-fixing lawn IIIOWel'S 
and small t'ngines lin· honH'OWIH'I'S in 
suburban Philaddphia. 


Slavin 
has 
always ht'l'll a fixer. "That's what I 
n·<tlly do," ht· says. "I fix things." Hut 
Slavin's love for tinkering didn't st•em 
to fit in so wdl with Gianwtti's Yak. "I 
1 didn't comt• ht·n· f{,,. liberal arts." ht• 
says. "I came here 
for 
electrical 
enginening. 
History 
is secondary. 
Humanities courses will make me a 
better person. but I don't have a great 
nt·ed to karn the stuff." 


Slavin gets the most pleasure out of 
learning how to fix things- how to 
take things apart and put them ha<·k 
togetht•r. For him possessions-likt· the 
Panasonic phone machine he just 
bought himself or the Ft•rrari on the 
wall- arl' like toys. "I was reading an 
a1·tide in Plavhov last month about not 
going out a~d .buying evnything you 
want at once. hut spreading it OVl'r a 
(>t'riod of ti111e. It's silly to wastt• 
S!lO,OOO on ;1 nt·w sports car unkss 
you're rl'allv making a lot in the first 
i>lacl'. It w<;uld be,; typically 19-ycar-
old thing to do." 


**Joe Gromacki: Poultry Farming**

HIS CASUAL MANNER DOESN'T 
u·iggcr the imagt• of a high-intensity 
stucknt cntn·pn•nt·ur. H is curly blond 
hair and his pink cheeks don't fit tht• 
hig-husim·ss mold. Rut .Joe Gromat·ki, 
a fn·shrnan who gn·w up in the rural 
Midwest, has gmssl'd ovn $10,000 in 
tht· last few yt•ars- poultry farming. 


It · was 
st•ven 
years ago 
when 
Gromacki went out and bought his 
first two hens and a rooster. From this 
initial investment, he cultivated a suc-
cessful business of raising and breedi.J.!g_ 
chickens out of his grandmother's barn 
in Sussex. Wisconsin. 


Although he scaled down the opera-
tion before coming to Yale this fall, 
Gromacki has invested in a new $2500 
barn and has built up a flock of birds 
worth $6000 that includes some 45 dif-
ferent breeds and varieties. 


Like most businessmen, Gromacki 
advertises extensively but his medium 
i!; a little different from most. He 
plan·s ads in commercial yearbooks 
and trade magazines throughout the 
year- among them, 
a 
publication . 
called Th,. Poultry Pun. Aside from 
keeping the business going, Gromacki 
has also served as the Wisconsin State 
director for two national poultry clubs 
and as a membt·r of the board of d irec-
tors 
Wisconsin 
Poultry 
Breeding Association. 


Gromacki conducts most of his 
business, however , at the numerous 
poultry shows that are held i'n the 
Midwest and the South, particularly in 
K ansas and Missouri. He attends
