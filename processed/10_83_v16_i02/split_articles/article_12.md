Cameron is surprised that no one 
has come looking for Martha Town-
send. "She died in 1797. First burial in 
Grove Street. Usually feminists are in-
terested in stuff like that." 

The· ornat<· graves in the: cemetery 
sometimes do get passed over by 
tourists looking for the resting place of 
Eli Whitney, Roger Sherman, Noah 
Webster or the dozens of other Revolu-
tionary, Civil and Spanish-American 
War veterans who lie there. One 
popular site is the large statue, com-
plete with axe a nd helmet, of J. T. 
Hemingway, New Haven's first fire 
chief. During the C ivil War the grave 
ofTheodore Winthrop, the first Union 
officer killed in battle, received over 
10,000 visitors. The French General 
Lafayette himself paid a visit to the 
cemetery in 1824 to honor its many 
Revolutionary War heroes. 

Yet walking through the cemetery, 
one wonders why it is so deserted. 
Most Yale students know nothing 
about it other than that it is probably 
dangerous and that they should stay 
away. 

"Not 
that 
I 
blame 
you," 
C-ameron savs. "You've probably got 
better things to do. But remembering 
the cemetery reminds you of lots of 
other important things too." 

Cameron is walking through the 
cemetery and pointing ou t his favorite 
gravestones 
in 
the late afternoon 
sunlight. "There's Ashmun, that one in 
front. He was the United States Am-
bassador to Liberia in the 19th cen-
tury. There's a pair of twins right 
behind him, and we've even got one 
dog." T he dog, "Albert: 1845"1848," is 
buried beside his mistress, H arriet 
Braun Smith. Albert's statue sits atop 
the stone with his name carved on a 
banner along the side. 

Cameron does have one epitaph 
which 
he is 
particularly fond of 
reading. It is on the stone of Mary 
Louise Meyers, a poet. The carving 
consists of several verses she wrote in 
1884. It beg~l)S, 
L ~ghts and shadows as they fall, 
Ltavt thtir mark upon tht wall. 
So it is in human lift, 
As wt battk in tht strijt. 

"Awfully 
pretty, 
think," says 
Cameron.
