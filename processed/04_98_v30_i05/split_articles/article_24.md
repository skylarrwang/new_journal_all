What I Saw at the Revolution 
Our intrepid reporter uncovers ex istential consp iracies 
while trying to participate in a United Farm W orkers march.

T
HE FOLLOWING IS A SERIES OF NEGATIONS, WHICH, 
oddly enough, evolves into a narrative and even con-
tains a small moral. This is the story of a story not told, of 
a rally not quite attended, of people unable to speak to 
one another, of a union that doesn't (yet) exist, and of 
toilets nowhere to be found. 

The strawberry industry, especially Driscoll Growers, is 
booming these days. It's not as difficult as you might think to 
make it in this business. Just listen to this fabulous offer from 
the Strawberry Workforce: for the incredibly low price of $7,999.99 
a year, your very own worker will stoop 12 hours a day, inhale carcino-
genic pesticides, and drink brackish water. And don't worry: there's no 
union included. If he tries to start one, simply return him for a full 
refund. High turnover and a low retirement age keep the industry 
anonymous and healthy. Those workers who want to speak out wcin't 
be speaking English; most of them can't even pronounce "Driscoll." 

Some of us in the consumer sector have begun to wonder whether 
cheap, delicious strawberries are worth the degradation of human life. 
To assuage our guilt, a friend and I drove down to Broadway's most 
spectacular show last week: a United Farm Workers solidarity march on 
behalf of strawberry pickers, led by Dolores Huerta and Gloria 
Steinem, from 96th to 72nd Street. 

By the rime we parked and caught an overstuffed subway to our 
destination, we were an hour late, with no rally in sight. The road 
wasn't even blocked off. A few cops were standing around smirking, 
proud to be keeping Broadway safe from mavericks like us. We were 
ready to give up and find a museum when the parade thundered down 
the sidewalk and enveloped us. In seconds, we were distributing pam-
phlets, wearing badges and holding signs. Close to 100 people marched 
below a bright blue Yale flag, singing, "We are the union I The mighty, 
mighty union! I Everywhere we go I People want to know I Who we 
are I So we tell them: I We are the union ... " On the fringes, stone-faced 
old communists flashed us the P~opk's ~~ko/ World. Displays spread 
out on both Banks featured ancient muckraking and conspiracy revela-
tions in Grenada and Nicaragua. Employees at fruit stands gave us the 
thumbs-up and leather-clad bikers honked. 

I was actually beginning to feel like "the unjon" when there, on 
80th Street, shimmering in the heat mirage of the horizon, stood the 
Cats of gourmet food, Zabars. Even amidst the din of leftist chants, 
Zabars's clarion public address system rang out: "Special on smoked 
salmon! Special on boccancini! Special on Guylian chocolate!" 

Through the window, I saw troves of rare olive oils and grizzled cheeses 
framing tables brimming with free samples. Throngs of satisfied cus-
tomers squeezed their way to the registers in the front window to pay 
for their booty. 

We figured we'd buy some hand-made food products 
and use :!if executive-quality washroom in time to join the 
tail end of the procession. Right away we snagged a 
ready-made snak-pak: fresh mozzarella balls soalcing in 
sun-dried tomato sauce. I paid while my friend found 
the bathroom. The parade passed by as I sampled a few 
crackers and some tangy goat cheese, ignoring the "take 
one, please" looks of Zabars managers, who asked if they 
could help me between Spanish directives barked at the line 
of beleaguered cashiers. Seven "''m just waiting for someones" later, 
I realized the UFW marchers were probably already in Jersey. I asked an 
olive oil representative where the bathroom was in ambitious though 
broken Spanish. "There is no bathrpom, sir," he said. 

Egad! It all made sense. First the strawberry fields, now Zabars: cos-
mically connected by a mysterious lack of plumbing facilities. Cus-
tomers and workers, our plights had at last converged. 

But if using the bathroom in Zabars was an existential impossibili-
ty, where was my friend? I ran upstairs, aisles of high-priced cookware 
flying by like so many parade marchers-marchers whose parade I was 
missing more and more with every gelato machine I passed. I paged 
her. I asked two stock boys whether they'd seen her: "No." Finally, a 
"take one, please" manager said, "You're going to have to leave, sir. 
You've been here too long without buying anything." He must have 
seen my UFW badge and mistaken me for a subversive conspirator. 

I threw down my mozzarella indignantly, walked outside and 
kicked down Broadway, looking for other lefr-wing stragglers. Eight 
blocks later, I found the march, congealed on 72nd Street. Someone 
was finishing a speech denouncing Driscoll, and everyone was holding 
hands. My friend was there too, next to the big Yale sign. We sang 
some garbled folk songs, and talked about informing the world about 
strawberry workers, since the Nau Yl>rk Times doesn't write about these 
sorts of rallies. 

In the end, the march became a sort of free-floating negation, a con-
tagion that seemed to spread to everyone who involves himself in the 
strawberry industry. I didn't read about it in the paper. I spent the entire 
day trying to talk to people who couldn't underscand me about bath-
rooms that weren't there and a friend I couldn't find. And in an infinite-
ly more extreme way, strawberry workers deal with the same sorts of 
frustrations every day. They fight with growers, people who can't even 
understand them, about the non-existence of perquisites most people 
won't talk about: benefits, security, day care, t<:>ilets and unions. 

So if you want to help strawberry workers, don't eat Driscoll 
fruit. You can buy the gourmet version at Zabars during the next 
illWm~.
