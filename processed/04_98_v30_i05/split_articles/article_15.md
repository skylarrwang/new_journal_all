describes the rituals she performs as spiritual 
"work," or service to please the spirits. Indica-
tive of this kind of religious mentality is the 
tattered copy of Success and Pown- through 
Psalms, Annie's guidebook, sitting on the 
white tablecloth. The softcover book offers 
spells, prayers and procedures with the reduc-
tive simplicity of a cookbook, a collection of 
recipes to cure any malady. For an upcoming 
court appearance, it explains, pray to St. John 
the Conqueror with incense and lemon juice_. 
For prosperity, pray to St. Jerome and light a 
votive candle. To ward off the evil eye, wear a 
charm called an acabache. 

"It's all very simple," Annie assures me, 
adjusting the glasses which make her wide 
eyes appear even larger. "If you're working for 
love, you work with apple, with honey, with 
sugar, with Agua de Florida. If you're trying to 
control a person, you put their name in 'com-
manding oil' on your heel and stamp them 
out. If a student comes who's having a test, I 
put the white of an egg in a glass of water, 
pray Psalm 134, and add the mixture with 
wintergreen behind the neck." 

It's one thing to absorb historical facts 
about folk religions, but when interacting 
with people whose faith in the power of the 
"spirits" is part of their daily existence, I find 
myself backing into a skeptic's corner. It's not 
that I don't believe in a higher power, but 
many of Annie's customs just seem contrived 
compared to the religious customs I've 
encountered before. 

Raised in a Jewish household with a week-
ly Shabbos dinner and meat and dairy dishes, 
I grew up viewing ritual customs as passe. As I 
realized that my Jewish traditions were as sub-
jective as other practices I doubted, I devel-
oped a kind of spiritual agnosticism. Sitting 
among the African sculptures and incense, I 
challenged my own conception of valid reli-
gious expression. 

T
he Botanica Chango storefront sits 
quietly along the bustle of Grand 
Avenue, the main drag of Fair Haven. 
Outside, a woman holding a baby hawks 
papayas and platanos from a van. The record 
shop across the street advertises "Salsa" in 
neon spray paint. Here, as in many small 
cities in southern Connecticut, se habla 
espanoL 

Shops like Botanica Chango, a religious 
drugstore, novelty shop and modern-day 
apothecary rolled in one, offer rare public evi-
dence of a secretive world. As Good Friday 
approaches, the patrons inspect trinkets, oils 
and lotions that line the store shelves. Chil-
dren are sent by their mothers to pick up can-
dles, and espicitistas stock up on supplies. An 
occasional big spender asks about the porce-
lain statues of saints on the higher shelves or 
the full body snakeskins that hang above the 
cash register. Young mothers with toddlers 
peruse the greeting cards on their way to the 
perfume counter. 

Some bring religious prescriptions written 
by their espiritistas on fine stationery. Others 
ask Grace, the friendly store manager, for 
remedies. More than just the folk believer's 
pharmacist, Grace is often asked to prescribe 
the medicines her store sells. After eight years, 
many of the community's believers have 
grown to rely on her spiritual advice to solve 
their problems. 

"Hola, Grace," calls out a young man 
with a gold chain and sweat pants. He 
explains in Spanish that he's been having 
arguments with his wife. Grace leans forward 
on her elbows and listens closely, asking the 
occasional question. She gives him blue 
lotion, a candle and a pack of incense. 

Relieved, he thanks her. 

Later, Grace explains the sale. "I gave him 
that bath lotion to remove the tension from 
his body, gave him that incense to dear the air 
in his house, and the candle to help him see 
the problems better." It's a holistic system of 
healing-the supernatural combined with the 
commonsensical. 

Almost all of those who believe in tradi-
tional religions consider themselves Catholic, 
even though the Pope has reiterated the 
Churdis ban on folk practices during several 
visits to the Caribbean. Although Grace con· 
tends that a large portion of the Fair Haven 
community practices some type of Catholic 
folk religion, local religious leaders seem to 
consider practices like Espiritismo childish 
behavior, not serious hereticism. 

"I might allude to it in one of my ser-
mons, but it's not an issue for my church," 
said Father Burbank at St. Rose's in Fair 
Haven. With a 70 percent Latino congrega-
tion, he's aware of the traditions behind the 
closed doors of many Latin American house· 
holds. "To find those religions I'd have to go 
digging for it-no one's going to tell me 
about it." 


THE NEW JouRNAL

Yet even though local religious officials 
choose co overlook these secretive religious 
forms, Annie says she has received implicit 
suppon for the work she does. "A priest from 
St. Mary's in New Haven once saw my room, 
and he blessed it, saying, 'As long as you don't 
harm anybody, it's OK"' 

Followers of Catholic folk religions are as 
observant as any other Catholics. "I just don't 
work on Holy Week before Easter," says 
Annie. "That's the time for prayer, to seep 
back, to pray co God, let Him do His work." 

Even though Annie is devoutly religious, 
it seems appropriate that she rediscovered 
Espiritismo through television, considering 
that folk religions have grown into a commer-
cial industry. Botanica Chango boasts "Free 
Money" candles and cans of "Three Kings" 
aerosol spray, which sport pictures of Jesus on 
their labels. Several times I watched patrons at 
Botanica Chango compare different brands of 
the same candle like shoppers in a flea market. 

In fact, the store caters to any spiritually 
aware customer, not just the consumer with 
Delroy's ingrained beliefs in the power of 
voodoo and spells. Many are middle class peo-
ple with a wider belief in spirituality than 
most. One afternoon I watched a tall African-
American woman direct Grace's assistant in 
finding a medicinal lotion. "Right there on 
the lefi: next co the blue one. And can I gee 
some oil of High John the Conqueror?" She 
leaves the score with $20 wonh of candles, 
lotion and incense. 

When I ask her which system of worship 
she practices, she laughs. "Espiritismo? Sante-
ria? What's that? I speak English," she says, 
depositing the shopping bag into the back of 
her Buick, next to the antifreeze. It turns out 
that she is Pentacostal. "I was brought up just 
believing in God-but God gave us wisdom 
to learn about the spiritual world." 

C C T
e traditional religions are alive 
and well going into the next cen-
tury," says Roben Thompson, 
Yale's expen on Wesc African religious cul-
ture. "AU religions of the world are coming 
out in our cities. There are differences to be 
celebrated regardless of the racist snickers of 
the West. What aU religions share is a search 
for meaning." 

Grace's husband, Angel Maninez, shows 
me the warehouse where Boranica Chango 
stores its supplies. He points to a porcelain 
statue of Santa Barbara in the corner. "If the 
president of Yale came co me with a blank 
check and offered me any amoum of money, I 
wouJd not give him this statue. She came to 
us in a vision, she is our guardian angel." 

I smile at his faith, his fervor. I'm not 
ready to accept the alternative meanings. 
From my rationalise, skeptical perspective, I'm 
more comfortable with my doubts. 

"You don't believe. I see this, you don't 
believe. Tonight, when you go home and try 
to sleep you won't be able to." Angel stares 
hard at my shocked expression. "Then you 
will believe."
