L'INFAME!" 
voLTAIRE's 
renowned exhortation to "crush 
the infamy" represents a monu-
mental campaign in the history of Western 
civilization against superstition and the power 
of the Church. The phrase is the harbinger of 
modernity, the emancipation of the individ-
ual, the ascendancy of liberalism and the tri-
umph of reason over fear: We must ask our- · 
selves, however, whether these ideas are still 
ascendant with the current resurgence of new 
age religions, including Christian "Promise 
Keepers," Hindu nationalism, Islamic funda-
mentalism, the Christian Coalition, the CCC 
and ~e Yale Five. Did the Enlightenment's 
cold rationalism lead us to a state of self-denial 
that we are only now realizing and rebelling 
against? Could it be that the idealistic project 
of secular, rational, universal self-improve-
ment turned out to be a shiny nothing? 

Steven Smith, Yale political science pro-
fessor and Branford College master, addresses 
these questions in his new book, Spinoza, Lib-
eralism, and the Question of jewish ldmtity. 
Smith traces the origins of modern liberal 
political philosophy to a source often ignored: 
seventeenth century Jewish thinker Baruch 
Spinoza. Although Spinoza's ethics, and to a 
lesser extent his metaphysics, are still studied, 
his political theories have been widely 
ignored. Smith argues that Spinoza's contribu-
tions to the canon of political philosophy are 
essential to understanding the development of 
our thought about the relationship between 
religion and the state. 

Smith positS that the overwhelming victo-
ry of liberalism has rendered us unable to see 
the complexity of the theologico-political 
problem. For this reason we must look to the 
past to understand the present situation: "Pre-
cisely because the founders of modernity did 
not live in a world shaped by the separation of 
church and state and an ethic of toleration, 
they give us a window on how we have come 
to arrive at our own self-understanding." 
Because we tend to take the separation of 
church and state as a given, we cannot easily 
see its ramifications. 

Spinoza's thinking on religion was influ-
enced by his own experiences: in 1656, at the 
age of 24, he was excommunicated by the 
elders of his synagogue for reasons of which 
scholars are still unsure. Many of his readers 
find that Spinoza's persecution led to his 
renowned passion for secrecy and his isolation 
was a source of ethical and political insight. 
Much of Spinoza's work is deeply critical of 
Judaism, characterizing it as legalistic, particu-
laristic and full of divine promises that lead to 
passivity and weakness. On the other hand, 
Spinoza characterizes Jesus as a profound moral 
philosopher, and Christianity as a religion fur-
ther advanced in the progression of reason. As a 
result, many interpreters of Spinoza see him as 
a self-hating Jew motivated by revenge. 

Smith disagrees with this interpretacion, 
arguing that since Spinoza was unable to cri-
tique Christianity because of the power of the 
clerics, he had to take a more circuitous route. 
By contrasting Judaism with Christianity, 
Spinoza was outwardly playing to the preju-
dices of the time, while insidiously advocating 
a civil religion based on reason rather than 
Scripture. This tactic seems rather Machiavel-
lian, but Smith counters that it is "constitutive 
of Spinoza's liberalism." Smith's argument is a 
little murky to say the least, and is never made 
fully clear in the book. Surely secrecy and 
duplicity are not "constitutive ofSpinoza's lib-
eralism"? This point aside, Smith's reading is 
sensitive and perceptive, showing clearly that 
Spinoza was not a rabid anti-Semite.

from 
ecclesiastical 
power, 
and 
of the 
autonomous individual conscience from pro-
scriptive · religion. On chiefly naturalistic 
grounds, Spinoza defends democracy as the 
best regime to achieve the ends of toleration, 
personal autonomy and self-formation. While 
to our modern ears these sound like inherently 
positive and innocuous ideas, Smith shows that 
they can have very different connotations when 
framed in terms of the "Jewish Question." 

The "Jewish Question" refers to a long-
standing debate in the Enlightenment as to 
whether Jews should be granted the same civil 
liberties as "ordinary" citizens. Smith argues 
that Jews represented the "Quintessential 
Other," a community that separated itself 
from the rest of society with a very distinct set 
of customs and laws. Jews could be welcomed 
into the modern civil state only if they would 
abdicate their traditions. Indeed, the true test 
of the modern state would be its capacity to 
assimilate the Jews. lit what Smith calls a 
"Faustian bargain," the Jews would gain toler-
ation only by losing their identity. 

"\VJhile Smith's ideas may seem rather 
W abstract to those not accustomed to 
the jargon of political theorists, his work is rel-
evant to current societal trends, especially the 
resurgence of charismatic and fundamentalist 
religious groups. These groups, often empha-
sizing a personal relationship with a savior or 
a certain "spiritual insight," appeal to a sense 
of awe, symbolism, sanctity and divine mys-

tery wholly within the secular ideal. 

The return to spirituality is a reaction 
against the idea of a ~tural melting pot in 
favor of a society based on diversity and multi-
culturalism. Smith points out that the idea of 
a melting pot is not at all neutral. Although in 
theory the melting pot results in a composite 
of the highest ideals from different cultures, in 
practice it often means conformity to Protes-
tant secularism. One need only look at Yale's 
many ethnic and cultural organizations to see 
discontent with the philosophy of the melting 
pot. On a national level, religious leaders such 
as Louis Farrakhan draw on racial identity as a 
source of self-esteem. Assimilation is now seen 
not as a liberating force but as an essential 
ingredient of patriarchy and domination. 

Smith points out that because Spinoza 
lived in sect-ridden seventeenth century Hol-
land, he did not see identity politics as a 
source of emancipation, but rather as "a 
means of imposing narrow orthodoxies and 
conformity." He sought to transcend a system 
where one was identified solely by one's reli-
gion. In order to understand the reaction to 
the Enlightenment Smith shows us that we 
must understand its o..rigins. To properly eval-
uate the causes of the current religious resur-
gence and the parallel renaissance of identity 
politics, we have to understand that the liber-
alism we have been taught to regard as neutral 
and innocuous is actually fraught with reli-
gious and political tensions. As Smith puts it, 
liberalism only extends toleration once we 
have rendered ourselves tolerable. 

Smith's analysis of modern political move-
ments is informed by a keen sense of history. 
But his insistence on framing the entire iden-
tity problem in modern politics in terms of 
the "Jewish Question" seems anachronistic. 
Moreover, Smith's book is not a light read. 
Sections on scriptural interpretation or the 
metaphysical unity of substance may discour-
age readers less dedicated to the subject mat-
ter. The work, however, provides an unexpect-
ed insight into sources of modernity and the 
various motivations stemming from the "Jew-
ish Question" that helped to create the liberal 
ideal of toleration. For this reason, the Spin-
ozist epigram to Smith's book seems most 
appropriate: "All things excellent are difficult 
as they are rare."
