T
he sky that Saturday was the color of 
swimming pools. It was the kind of day 
when undergraduates flood Cross 
Campus in T-shirts and flip-flops even 
if the temperature calls for cardigans and socks. 
Though there was a breeze that delivered waves 
of goose bumps, when the wind was still you 
could feel the sun beating down as if it were summer
already. Even though it was only the first 
week after Spring Break, the gray of winter and 
the worries of the school year seemed to evaporate
with the sun's arrival. 

Despite the appearance on Cross Campus of 
leisure and laxness, a cool undercurrent of 
anxiety was about. Among the 
clumps of people laughing one 
could see course packets, the 
pages rustling, perhaps unat-
tended but nonetheless opened, 
as if reading were possible in 
such weather and in such com-
pany. There was the steady 
stream of more conscientious 
students cloistering themselves in Cross 
Campus Library. Among those 
moving 
underground 
were 
three members of Consent, an 
undergraduate 
organization 
that staffs a sexual assault hot-
line. They carried helpful hints about protection, 
a computer printout on blue paper which read 
RAPE AWARENESS WEEK in large letters and news-
paper clippings mounted on paper in eye-catch-
ing Day-Glo colors. The three Consent members 
were there to set up a display in one of the glass 
cases between Machine City and CCL. The dis-
play would draw attention to the upcoming 
National Rape Awareness Week and promote 
events the group was sponsoring on campus. 
"I felt proud making the display," said Maren 
Obermann (CC '99). "It's an issue I care very 
much about, and I thought it was effective. I 
thought people would notice it." In particular she 
mentioned the newspaper clippings from a variety 
of sources: the New York Times, a year-old Yale Herald
letter to the editor, and then too, recent clip-
pings from the Yale Daily News covering an alleged 
sexual assault case in an off-campus apartment in 
November. "I thought it would get people's atten-
tion," said Obermann. 

By the time the Consent volunteers finished 
stapling their display it was around 4:30. The 
library was set to close at five. There was no key to 
the glass case, so they left it unlocked. Then, proud 
of their work, they filed out of the underground 
tunnel, back onto Cross Campus where the last 
few sun-worshipers sat in 
disorganized clumps. 

The next day, two of the 
three Consent volunteers 
were out on Cross Campus 
lawn. Laughter reverberated 
against the stone walls of 
Berkeley College. One of 
the 
Consent 
volunteers, 
Teresa Lawson (MC '99), 
walked into CCL to see the 
display she had so proudly 
assembled the day before, 
but found 
it destroyed. 

Some of the clippings were 
gone and the printout that had read RAPE AWARE-
NESS WEEK now read only AWARENESS. 

It was a strange way to voice dissent. Half of the 
display had been removed, but half had been left 
behind—a ghostly reminder of Consent's efforts to 
advertise—and this fact raised interesting ques-
tions. Had the vandals ripped the whole thing 
down immediately, would the counter-display have 
had the same violent effects? Or leaving it as they 
did? Had the authors of the new display drawn con-
spicuous attention to their own efforts, to their 
power as destroyers of a message? Their action was 
a violent one—a rape of the word—and a preemp-
