"Look at the ceiling height here," Richard 
Lytle says as he stands up and touches plaster 
with the palm of 
his 
hand. 
"I 
mean, it's ridiculous!" Lytle grins 
and 
sits 
back 
down, still laughing at the ceiling 
barely above him. 
It is the seven 
foot ceiling on 
the eighth floor 
of Yale's Art and 
Architecture 
Building. 
Seven 
feet-perfectly 
good 
walk 
around under, to 
sit down and eat 
or to have a 
conversation 
beneath-but no 
space 
for 
artist about to 
make a ten foot high painting. 

So the painters are leaving. Lytle chairs a 
building committee currently completing 
plans for the School of Art's new home on 
Chapel Street across from the Art & Architecture building. Once the New Haven Jewish Community Center (JCC), 
1156 
Chapel has been vacant for more than 15 
years. The School of Art plans to move in at 
the end of 1999. 

Paul Rudolph designed Yale's A&A building in 1963 and garnered the praise of the 
architecture world for his creative use of 
space. Rudolph's vision was to balance form 
and void, interior and exterior, rough and 
smooth. But Lytle's committee is balancing 
different scales: cost and time, function and 
appearance, one artist's space versus another's. 

The A&A building is still a staple of architecture textbooks, and Rudolph remains recognized as an outstanding pioneer of modern 
architecture. "It's a monumental piece of 
sculpture," Lytle says, even 30 years after plywood partitions and lopsided drafting tables 
have broken up Rudolph's original vision. 

Forced out by cramped conditions, much 
of the School of Art has already left the 
Rudolph building behind. Sculpture hides 
out on Mansfield Street. Graphic Design is 
on Park Street. Undergraduate painting is 
split between York and Park. The renovated 
JCC building will eventually bring these 
departments back together. But, more importantly, it will give students in each department more space. 

After all, a "monumental piece of sculpture" isn't always the best place to create sculpture. "To make art you need light, air and 
space," says Richard Benson, Dean of the Art 
School. "But the real thing you need is a 
building that the art students can ruin. You 
can't put art students or artists in a space and 
not expect them to make a mess of it." So 
when the School of Art decided to renovate 
1156 Chapel, Lytle's committee left the Paul 
Rudolphs behind and went straight to architect Deborah Berke, author of Architecture for 
the Everyday, a book compiled to remind us 
that successful architecture can be extremely 
unmonumental. 

"We're not trying to get a place with beautiful finishes and perfect detail. What we really need is a big set of loft spaces," says Benson. 

The new Yale School of Art building will have 
painting studios on the top floor to access the 
best light. It will have computer hookups, 
year-round climate control and a three level 
gallery. It will have space. And so will the Yale 
School of Architecture. The Rudolph building is slated to be renovated soon after the 
School of Art moves out, restoring many of 
the open spaces that have been closed up for 
convenience. 

"We don't study art. We make art," Benson says with a smile in his half-partitioned 
A&A office. "That's what we're interested in." 

Making art just doesn't require hand-molded 
walls and blank open voids. What it does 
require, according to the present renovation 
plan, are freight elevators, wide staircases and 
some really high ceilings.
