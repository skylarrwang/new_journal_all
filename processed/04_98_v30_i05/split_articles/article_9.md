FROM AN UNDERGRADUATE'S PERSPECTIVE, 
unions at Yale appear to serve only a 
perennial role, one almost as predictable and 
expected as the grass-growing rituals on Old 
Campus. The contract expires, the union 
wants to make changes, Yale dislikes them, 
the two sides bicker for months on end and 
at the last possible minute the dispute is settled and the issue disappears back into the 
stonework. The intervening confla-
gration of vigils, parades, 
sidewalk proselytization 
and omnipresent pro-
paganda more closely 
resembles the internal 
contretemps of an emerg-
ing Eastern European coun-
try than the goings-on at an 
elite university. 

Well, that's how it's supposed to 
work, anyway. 

Ask any junior or senior if the names 
Proto, Vallone, Locals 34 and 35 and GESO 
ring a bell, and memories of the strike of '96 
emerge as dearly as did the unions' 6 a.m. 
chants two springs ago. 

The most recent labor flare-up between 
the YPBA and Yale heralds a marked divergence from the trend to which upperclass-
men are now accustomed. No marches on 
Beinecke Plaza, no visiting celebrities to 
attract media attention to the unions' cause. 
In fact, both the police union and Yale seem 
determined to avoid attention. 

Let's back up for a minute. How many 
students actually know exactly what YPBA 
stands for? (Hint: the "B" stands for "Benevolent." Catchy, no?) How about the names 
Juhas and Morganti? The most noted participants in this dispute aren't even from the 
unions or the administration. They're students like Noel Poyo (MC '98), who have 
assumed roles as active champions of a 
hushed and elusive cause. 

But what is this cause for which they 
fight? Why doesn't anyone know what's 
going on, and why doesn't anyone care? All 
the student publications covered the battle 
between Locals 34 and 35 and Yale. The Yale 
Daily News ran labor articles every morning, 
and, during the strike, devoted a full column 
to day-by-day updates of labor talks. The 
New journal dedicated an entire issue to the 
topic of "Labor at Yale." 

No one is reporting the YPBA dispute 
precisely because nothing seems to be happening. The situation sounds a rather absurd 
note for labor relations. The administration 
says it's ready and waiting for the YPBA to 
contact them; all the union has to 
do is pick up the phone. The 
police 
union, 
meanwhile, 
alleges that the University is 
stonewalling them and trying 
to bully them into 
signing a contract. And 
both sides optimistically 
express their confidence 
in reaching an agree-
ment-soon. Yale and the unions 
must be honing their diplomatic acumen, 
because they haven't publicly met since 
December. 

More disconcerting than the lack of 
basic communication between the two sides 
is the lack of even feigned concern on the 
part of Yale and its students. Who will be 
on the other end of the blue phone if the 
YPBA is on the picket line? 

One can only guess why the police 
union agreed to a gag rule for speaking to the 
press about labor relations. Perhaps they 
thought it would make talks with Yale easier, 
or maybe they didn't think the students held 
enough clout with the higher-ups. But by 
keeping the situation under wraps, the YPBA 
lost one of its greatest potential allies. Who 
else should care about security if not the students? Why should students care if they don't 
know that their security is at risk? 

The question of who's to blame is moot 
since neither side, nor the people caught in 
the middle, are stirred enough to point a finger. In the good old days of labor strife, we 
could count on the eleventh hour. But today, 
no one even cares what time it is.
