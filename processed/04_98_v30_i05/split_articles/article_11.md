Those who spend their days looking 
through telescopes have been given new reason to turn their gazes back toward Earth. 
NASA and the Yale School of Medicine, the 
most unlikely of partners, have engaged in a 
collaborative project to develop futuristic 
medical technologies. Researchers from the 
Commercial Space Center for Medical Informatics 
Technology 
Application 
(CSC/MITA), located at the medical school, 
have been working almost five years to reinvent health care through the burgeoning field 
of telemedicine. 

CSC/MITA was created to foster a partnership among businesses, academic centers 
and government agencies that would develop 
advanced technology for NASA's needs, especially missions to Mars. The Center has since 
become a leader in the telemedicine field, 
which allows doctors to administer health care 
electronically 
distant 
points. 
Its 
researchers have invented devices that allow 
doctors to check a patient's blood pressure, 
pulse, body temperature and oxygen levels 
from continents or even planets away. Such 
groundbreaking gadgets are complemented by 
new technology to facilitate remote surgery 
whereby a physician could move his hand in a 
sensor on earth and have a scalpel move in the 
same direction in space. 

Though these projects may sound far-
fetched, they will be tested in the coming 
weeks. In May, CSC/MITA will have its first 
opportunity to test these technologies in 
remote conditions similar to outer space: the 
Yale team will participate in the 1998 Everest 
Extreme Expedition. Climbers, scientists and 
doctors will put geological and surveying 
devices on the mountain's summit more than 
29,000 feet above the ground. Researchers 
from CSC/MITA will then establish an 
advanced medical clinic at Base Camp to provide telemedical support for the 1998 climbing season and experiment with some of their 
latest medical technologies. 

"Scientific investigation of high altitude 
effects with technology previously not available will extend our understanding of the 
human body beyond the incredible discoveries of previous expeditions," said Dr. Richard 
Satava, director of CSC/MITA. When the 
climbers begin their assault of the summit, 
they will wear vital signs sensors and wireless 
transmitters that collect scientific data on performance and endurance. The Center's 
newest telemedicine programs will transmit 
these vital signs to doctors at the School of 
Medicine. Data concerning nearly every 
aspect of human endurance, including blood 
pressure, pulse, EKGs, body temperature and 
signs of fatigue, will be transmitted in real 
time for Yale researchers to monitor. "All this 
data will be analyzed to help further our 
knowledge of human performance in extreme 
environments," said Satava. 

When the climbers put on such exotic 
accessories as medical sensors and portable 3-
D tele-ultrasound systems during the ascent 
in Nepal, doctors in New Haven will be analyzing the effects of high altitude. They will 
also diagnose any injuries that might occur. 
But while virtual diagnosis may be appealing 
to the climbers, with the nearest doctor 
10,000 feet away, treatment is another issue. 


**Tune Inn, Sell Out**

When I went to the Tune Inn on Saturday 
night the crowd sported mohawks-big skyscraper mohawks towering above their heads 
in green and purple spikes a foot tall or more. 
The punk-lovers came from all over New 
Haven, Stamford, Milford and Guilford. 

They were pierced and wore torn clothes, 
dark, heavy eyeliner and black cherry lipstick. 
Some stood outside near the club entrance, 
where the sound of beating drums and angry 
shouts pulsed into the street on waves of sweat 
and cigarette smoke. A hundred more slam-
danced on the 269-person dance floor inside.
