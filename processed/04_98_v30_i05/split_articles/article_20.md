**Title: The New Haven People's Center**
**Page number(s): 23-24**

'' I 
believe a people's movement is about to unfold in this coun-
try. Inequity is rising. Soon, people won't be willing to sit on 
the sidelines any more. We think it's very important to have 
a place for things like this to happen." Joelle Fishman, wear-
ing her customary apologetic smile, gestures at the space around her, a 
large room typical of new suburban houses with hardwood floors, white 
walls and ample sunlight. In this environment, Joelle might be taken 
for a middle-aged housewife, her sweatpants appropriate for cleaning, 
cooking, maybe taking care of aged parents. Similarly, the New Haven 
People's Center might be mistaken for nice but affordable student 
housing conveniently located on Howe Street, close to Mamoun's and 
cheap Chinese food. 

After a moment's conversation with Joelle, a deeper understand-
ing of the building's true personality, and her own, become clear. 
The Center's origin 130 years ago as a private home, and its trans-
formation 50 years later into a meeting place for poor immi-
grants, is reflected in its narrow hallways, small rooms and wide 
selection of leftist literature and posters. Joelle's father, who 
lives with her, is looking through 
the latest P~opk's ~ek(y WOrU the 
national newspa.per of the American 
Communist Party. Even in the stuffy heat 
of the Center, his &ail body is wrapped in a 
heavy coat and wool Scar£ He is dwarfed by Boor-
to-ceiling shelves filled with books. Walking through 
the room, Joelle picks up yellowed photographs of New 
Haven radicals, Communist pamphlets and People's 
Center fliers. She continues into the small library, with 
its musty, donated volumes. Here, students catalog 
the collection according to the system used in the 
Marxist Library and Resource Center in New York. 

Joelle's ideals are drawn from the tradition of 
leftist politics and community action that compris-
es the Center's philosophical core. She was raised in 
a progressive working-class family. "I learned to play the piano in a 
union hall. I remember making coffee on cold days and bringing it to 
the picketers, and boycotting Woolworth's when they didn't let blacks 
sit at the lunch counters." She participated in the 1963 March on 
Washington and ran New Haven's Angela Davis Bookstore in the early 
'70s. Joelle's time is now split between the Center (she is a board mem-
ber), the Communist Party (she is Connecticut Chairperson and one 
of seven National Secretaries) and her job as secretary at a local union. 

The beliefs that Joelle espouses permeate the conversations at the 
Center. As they repair the pipes, volunteers trade jibes about politicians' 
positive assessment of the economy. They know too many people who 
have not been lifred by the rising tide. Acknowledging economic 
improvement would be tantamount to admitting that capitalism might 
lead to peace, justice and prosperity. 

Though the Center is not officially affiliated with any political ide-
ology, its leanings are heavily leftist. "The People's Center has been part 
of every major struggle that has marked our country, including union-
ization and the desegregation of schools, jobs and sports," says Center 
President Al Marder, whose stories date mainly from the 1930s and 
'40s. The Center organized and played host to New Haven's first inter-
racial basketball team (the Redwings), its first interracial drama group 
(the Unity Players) and its first celebration of International Women's 
Day. The first production of Clifford Odets' Waiting for Lefty was a 
Center project, performed by the Unity Players with a Yale student 
director in 1938. Marder remembers that the city wouldn't allow the 
group to rent a school building because of the play's leftist content. 

Marder also recalls the many unionization campaigns of the peri-
od, in which student-supported Center activists worked with laborers 
from the automobile and meatpacking industries, as well as workers 
from what is now Local 35. When Joelle's generation started ele-
mentary school in the 1950s, Marder's generation was taking over 
the Center, participating in anti-lynching demonstrations and 
desegregation efforts. Marder recaJis the successful struggle to 
establish a night school to help working people earn degrees. 

Then, as now, Center activists neither flaunted nor denied 
their communist and socialist sympathies. 
Marder will emphasize the Cen-
ter's lack of political affiliation, but he 
is proud of its tradition of working for 
The McCarthy era brought fear, bomb threats and 
arrests to Center activists. "I remember stopping to drop 
things off for my father at the Whalley Avenue Jail when 
I was five," says Joe Taylor, as he rakes leaves in the 
Center's backyard. Taylor says he was practically born 
in the Center and continues to volunteer there. 

"There were people who killed themselves because 
of all this," he says, as other Center volunteers nod 
solemnly. Joelle, whose father's activism caused 
him to lose his job as a schoolteacher, remembers 
the anti-progressive climate just as vividly. "I didn't realize until I was an 
adult that no Girl Scout troop would accept me, and that's why my 
mother started her own troop," says JoeUe. She tells these anecdotes of 
childhood rejection as if they were disturbing but distant news blurbs, 
poignant examples of historical discrimination rather than stories of 
personal injury. 

As fears of communism subsided to a less hysterical pitch in the late 
1960s, the Center sponsored unionization efforts and helped workers 
fight employers including Yale-New Haven Hospital and New Haven 
schools. Center activists supported various Yale unionization drives and 
strikes by bringing coffee and lunch to strikers and providing an alter-
native classroom site during graduate student actions. Volunteers' recol-
lections of the 1970s cover everything from braving tear gas at the 1970 
New Haven murder trial of Black Panthers leader Bobby Seale to host-
ing pot luck dinners and picketing during the 1979 Winchester 
Firearms strike. "You meet good people on a picket line," says John 
Hiller, a Park Service worker. He is one of the Center's younger volun-
teers, but he still seems more like a father than a firebrand activist. The 
volunteers' graying, parental appearances con-
trast sharply with their stories of being 
dragged by police and wiping tear gas from 
friends' eyes. ***** 

The Center's next major struggle came 
after the building sustained major damage 
from serving as a daytime drop-in center for 
" the homeless (staffed partly by YHHAP 
members and the Law School Legal Aid Pro-
ject). A local real estate broker, an alder-
woman and others joined in a campaign to 
prevent the Center from getting a HUD grant 
to fix up the building. Joelle laughs when she 
recalls this group's efforts to "prove" she was a 
Communist. 'Td run for Congress on the 
Communist ticket several rimes," she says, 
smiling at the absurdity of the situation. 

Drawing on local support, the. Center ulti-
mately managed to win the funding in a vote 
by the Board of Aldermen. 

Friends hope that she might one day run 
as a Democrat, but Joelle has stuck fast to her 
chosen label through eight Congressional 
campaigns. "My beliefs come from my 
group," she says. "Why should I hide the 
name of it? We didn't make 'Communist' a 
bad word. Now the same thing's happening 
with 'liberal.' It doesn't matter what you call 
yourself. If someone wants to run a smear or 
fear campaign, they'll do it." Joelle's feelings of 
persecution clearly draw on personal experi-
ences-menacing cars and threatening phone 
calls. Her personal brand of politics neglects 
some of the more global reasons that commu-
nism was demonized in the United States. 

Despite JoeUe's experiences of isolation 
and discrimination, she maintains faith in 
community action and mass movements. "I 
believe that Communists are the greatest 
patriots in this country," she says, without 
offering a definition of patriotism. She contra-
dicts the image of the coup-hungry radical, 
saying. "A small group wouldn't stay in power 
anyway. We're about educating and organjz-
ing--<:hanging the future of our country, 
because this country needs to be changed fun-
damentally." While the rhetoric sounds lifted 
from 1930s propaganda, it remains current 
for Joelle. She cites an active Youth Commu-
nist League as proof that the movement still 
exists. "Look around you. The need is greater 
than ever. The movement has always been
