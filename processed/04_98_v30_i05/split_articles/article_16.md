American Dream 
Elena O xman 
I took these photograp~ in Utah over Spring Break. Most of the towns I photographed were siruated in 
the Northern Valleys, some right outside of fancy ski resorts like Park City. The contrast was astounding. I 
saw very few people as I walked around, and I think the photographs reflect this sense of loneliness. The 
human traces in the pictures are mostly inanimate-signs, cars, houses. I photographed them because I fed 
they are charged with the hope and tragedy of the American Dream.
