ADORNING THE WALLS OF A BACK ROOM IN ANNIE'S APART-
ment near Wooster Square are symbols of African deities, 
Catholic icons, lucky rabbit's feet. Her shelves showcase stat-
ues of saints, carved animal faces and Congo sculpture. 
Yoruba metal symbols adorn the room beside glass bowls of water and 
dozens of candles. Religious beads hang from the walls with Mexican 
hats and dice. Every few moments, a parakeet caws out from its cage. 
The white tablecloth is decorated with uinkets, incense and colorful 
vials of oil. A plastic buddha sur-
veys the scene. To my uninitiated 
eyes, I'm sitting in a virtual Reli-
gious Studies lecture: a feast of 
faiths, a visual dance of doctrines. 

We hear the front door creak 
open, step into the kitchen and see 
two men waiting for Annie. "You 
were right, Annie, you knew he'd 
get shot," says Lamont. He sucks 
his teeth, gold tooth flashing in the 
dim light of the small apartment. 

_ Delroy, his friend, shakes his 
E dreadlocks incredulously.

They are here for a consulta-
~ tion with Annie, a practitioner of 
~ Espiritismo, a Puerto Rican folk 
~ religion. Lamont is on probation 
~ for the sale of marijuana, and last 
~ week he and a friend carne to Annie for a consultation. After a prayer 
~ session, Annie warned them that they were in danger. Several hours 
.:i later, his friend was shot on the street. Now, with this friend in the hos-
~ pital and galvanized faith in Annie's abilities, Lamont has returned to 
-5 her aparunent for further spiritual guidance. 

Annie appears glad to see the men, but she is aware of the urgency 
of their visit. Her expression is businesslike as she invites her clients to 
sit down on the plastic picnic chairs at her table. 

Decorum demands that I refrain from watching the session. But 
from my seat in the kitchen, I can peek into Annie's back room to 
watch Lamont. He clasps his hands in front of his face in concentra-
tion. The chants and drum rhythms of traditional Yoruba m_usic rise 
from the stereo. Lazy curls of incense smoke drift through the open 
door towards me, and the kitchen fills with its sweet scent, mixed with 
pungent cigar fumes. ("Many of 
the spirits like the smoke," Annie 
later explains.) Afrer opening with 
a prayer in rapid Spanish, Annie 
listens as Lamont describes the 
spells that have been tormenting 
him. As she later recounts, she . 
lights candles labeled "Justo Juei' 
and "Court Case," and they pray 
for justice. 

Soon it is Delroy's turn. He is a 
Jamaican man in his 40's or 50's 
who swears he has been tormented 
by an evil spell. "My sister has 
been trying to kill me for ten 
years," he says, and Annie begins 
to interrogate him. All I can hear 
are Delroy's impassioned descrip-
tions of the spiritual chaos the 
spells have wreaked, Annie's high-pitched, heavy Spanish accent and a 
periodic "Right, right" from Delroy. They speak for more than an hour 
as the rhythm of the music rages on and the scent of incense thickens. 

Annie prepares a mix of Agua de Florida-a sweet-smelling perfume--
and Delroy fervently spreads the mixture over himself. he covers his 
face, his skin and his clothes. She instruCts Delroy to pray to the spirits 
of his parents, and co cake several spiritual baths over the next few 
weeks. 

Delroy emerges into the kitchen, exhausted. "Annie knows her 
scuff, man," he says. "She's going to help me gee rid of those evil spells." 
My reaction is one of skepticism-magic spells have always been the 
stuff of fairy tales for me. 

I've always felt uncomfortable with the way African religions are 
depicted in pop culture as dark, wicked creeds. But it's hard to defend 
folk religions when confronted with the strangeness of Delroy's 
dtoughts. lc's easy to have an open mind, but does that mean accepting 
all that you take in? 

'' s
ee, we call ourselves Espiritistas," Annie tells me later. "We're 
spiritual people, mediums." She is quick to steer away from 
popular misconceptions of folk religions and voodoo. "We 
are more into God than anything else. This is not Black magic, but 
Mesa Blanca, the White Table." 

Annie explains that the sacred ability to communicate with the spir-
its is known to be passed down in families. "My father was a medium 
too. When I was small, in Puerto Rico, I used to tell people things 
before they happened. He said, 'you're going to follow me'-1 said for-
get ic. But when I carne co th.is country, I saw a reader on TY, and knew 
I had co start using that power." 

After studying for 15 years with a New York spiritualist, Annie 
began to establish a diverse following in New Haven. "Most of my cus-
tomers are black, Jamaican," says Annie. "Plenty of Latinos coo." She 
sees a variety of clients seeking guidance, from couples with marital 
problems and families down on their luck to ex-cons like Lamont. "He 
comes to me a lot, you know. He's always in a lot of trouble with the 
law, he uses three names," says Annie. 

Her powers are renowned in local circles, bur Annie's reputation 
within the loosely-knit Espiritisca community goes far beyond the 
streets of New Haven. Her husband proudly describes the assortment 
of visitors who have come from New York, Boston and Chicago co pray 
with Annie. Recently she was invited co practice in a spiritualist temple 
in New York. 

Annie is quick to set herself apart from other healers, many of 
whom are jealous of her reputation. "I don't go around killing ani-
mals, doing stuff like that. A lot of readers charge three, four, five 
hundred dollars, but I do it for God, for faith, not money, not any-
thing like that." 

Her face is youthful though the edges of her hair are greying. She 
keeps her thick glasses on a beaded cord around her neck. 

"I'll stay our of trouble, Annie," Lamont says on his way our of the 
apartment. He sounds like a boy appeasing his mother. 

Annie's homeland is a world of religious juxtaposition. In the 
islands of the Caribbean, the West A.ftican diaspora has inter-
mingled with Catholic missionaries for centuries. With the 
influx of slaves to the New World, syncretic religions-those that have 
roots in Christianity as weLl as traditional sour~eveloped. These 
include Haitian Voodun, Brazilian Condoble, Cuban Santeria and vari-
ous Catholic folk religions like Espiritismo. The creolization of this reli-
gion, apparent in the eclectic decorations on the walls ot'Annie's room, 
has continued in American cities. Combining elements from Roman 
Catholicism, Santeria, Native American healing riruals and European 
Spiritism, Espiritismo seems a religious microcosm of the American 
melting pot. 

In Espiritismo, prayer to God is essential. Annie explains that an 
appeal to the spirits can be crucial in order co set one's world right. She
