in front of the club. Carrying variously 
shaped black boxes, they exchanged some 
hand slaps with the ktds loitering outside, 
then tried to make their way inside. Fernando 
Pinto, the club's owner, stopped them at the 
door-"Hey, hey, hey" -
and held out his 
hand for the cover charge. They looked at 
him strangely. 

"They're in the band," explained a green-
haired kid standing by the entrance. Fernan-
do gave an embarrassed smile and motioned 
for them to pass. The band members pushed 
him aside. 

In the six years that he has run the club, 
Fernando has become accustomed to put-
downs 
from 
his sometimes 
volatile 
crowds. Since 
founding the 
Tune Inn in 
1992, he has 
devoted 
the 
all-ages 
club 
to 
punk, 
hard-core and 
ska 
cultures 
whose 
main 
joy 
comes 
from defying 
the establish-
ment, includ-
ing him. Each 
night he stands at the door as a bouncer and 
enforces the cover charge. More than once he 
has had to flush patrons' weed supplies down 
the toilet or pour their 50 ounce bottles of gin 
into the street. His crowds have also caused 
problems with investors in the club's Ninth 
Square neighborhood, who would like to see 
the Tune Inn razed as part of a neighborhood 
revitalization effort. Fernando recendy put 
the club on the market. As head of his own 
label, Elevator Music (which launched groups 
such as Dinosaur Jr. and the Flaming Lips), 
he can return to promotion as soon as he sells 
the club. "Running this place is hard," he 
said. "I want a more relaxed job." 

Fernando's efforts to make his club more 
marketable have frustrated club die-hards try-
ing to escape the mainstream music scene. 
Once a place where parents were afraid to 
send their children, the Tune Inn now swarms 
with giddy 12-year-olds who listen to M1V-
populariz.ed ska and wear baby T-shirts 
straight out of a YM spread. "They don't care 
about the music," said Liz Chodos, 16, a 
Tune Inn veteran. "They just go because they 
think it's cool to be in downtown New Haven 
at night." 

In the six months since it obtained its 
liquor license, the Tune Inn has drastically 
altered its set-up. A ceiling-high wire fence 
now blocks off half the dub for the 21 and 
over patrons. A full bar with pool tables, a red 
Buddha, a montage of old guitars, construe-
cion hats and steer horns now stands where 
there were once comfy couches and picnic 
tables. "The Tune Inn used to have this weird 
atmosphere that was really attractive," said 
Liz. "Now it's 
really hard to 
sit down any-
where." 

Fernan-
do sees in his 
older crowd 
the opportu-
nity to pro-
mote 
blues, swing, 
garage, 
surf 
and rockabil-
ly music that 
he 
believes 
will 
domi-
nate under-
ground ' s 
future. Hard-core shows that draw younger 
audiences have nearly disappeared from the 
club roster, restricted to 5 p.m. Sunday 
matinees. 

The week before Saturday's show, the 
Tune Inn hosted a swing show. I arrived at 
the club to find four girls, all age 16, wait-
ing outside the club. "It's all old people 
playing music. We didn't know it was all 
old people," said Breigh Garguilo, a four 
year veteran whose business the Tune Inn 
may soon lose. 

The normally full entrance area was 
completely empty. Inside, less than 15 kids 
stood on the giant dance floor, none of them 
dancing. The bar housed a few ratty-haired 
40-year-olds in leather jackets, dressed like 
members of Spinal Tap. Walking back out-
side, I asked the girls what they were doing. 
"Waiting to go home." They would come 
back the next week when Fernando played 
better music.
