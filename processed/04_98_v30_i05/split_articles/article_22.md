**Title: White Bred, White Trash**

FRESHMAN YEAR I HAD AN AFFINITY FOR WONDER BREAD. I 
loved to rip the center out of entire loaves of the stuff, roll the 
dough into tiny balls and chow down. While indulging this 
strange habit in the company of my roommate in the Calhoun 
dining hall one Friday evening, she glared at me and said, "PWT." 
"Excuse me?" I asked, mouth stuffed with Wonder Bread balls. 
"Poor White Trash," she spat back, obviously annoyed by my 
bizarre behavior. 

Over the next few months, the letters PWT came in and out of my 
life. They popped up on the tongues of academics, in sociology classes 
and on television. Her playful insult began to bother me in a way that I 
had never noticed before. Rather than express my discomfort, I was 
silent. The term PWT has not disappeared from my life, and I still often 
remain silent. In fact, the letters PWT come up more frequently these 
days: said in passing at meetings, at luncheons, in casual conversations 
with close friends. 

Despite my suburban Jewish upbringing in affluent Westport, 
Connecticut, my background makes me "poor white trash." My mother, born deep in the hills of East Kentucky, is what most would call a 
bona fide hillbilly. She didn't see a television until she was 18, had her 
birth certificate signed by an illiterate midwife with an "X" and educated herself by reading all of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. She and seven 
other people lived in a three-room house with a tin roof. She was poor. 
She had no shoes. Her cousins had babies at age 13. There were two 
sets of marriages in the same generation between related families, resulting in my mom having nine double first cousins. By blood these 
cousins are almost brothers and sisters. 

My mother was the valedictorian of her high school class and made 
her way out of the holler with a scholarship to a northern university 
and a two year stint in the Peace Corps. It was during this time that she 
met my father. She was trying to educate the world, he was dodging the 
draft. They moved up north to be near better schools and New York 
City. Over the next 27 years, my mom's accent became almost indistinguishable from those of the yuppies who shopped on Main Street. She 
could schmooze with the best of them and fight for parking spaces like 
a true New York native. But despite my mom's "Yankee-fication," each 
Sunday morning when she speaks to my grandmother her accent reappears; the crops and pick-up trucks and my cousins' basketball games 
are the subjects of her conversations. Each Sunday morning on the 
phone, I also try to sink back into a Kentucky home I have never really 
known. 

I had a very different relationship with my Kentucky family—all 63 
double second cousins—before I came to Yale. I visited every summer. We would swim, taunt the craw dads, make dandelion chains. 
We would collect locust shells and snake skins. We traipsed through the 
strip-mined hills, in and around lakes owned by my family for seven 
generations. No one cared about school and when I was there I didn't 
either. What mattered was who would fill the inflatable pool with warm 
water and who would entertain us while we shucked corn out by the 
creek. We were all constantly covered with bee stings and chigger bites 
and calamine lotion. I knew I cared about academics, but catching 
lightning bugs at twilight with my cousins, nothing really mattered but 
our blood ties. 

One night, the summer before I came to Yale, this all changed. I 
was shelling peas on the porch with my sister when my aunt yelled to 
my father, "How much does Yale cost a year?" My father said, "About 
30,000 bucks." My cousins stared at me in disbelief. At that instant, I 
was no longer the quirky cousin from Connecticut, but the epitome of 
the rich elite. It broke my heart that night, but by the time I had been 
at Yale for three weeks, I wanted to be nothing but the rich elite girl 
they perceived me to be. 

Freshman year, I knew how to talk the talk. I could banter and 
make judgments about which New York private schools were the 
most prestigious. I knew which city kids performed in the opera 
and the ballet. I memorized the names of the coolest clubs and bars and 
although I had never been to any of them, I acted like I sure as hell had. 
My own life in Westport had been dotted with the typical suburban 
rites of passage: private dance lessons, four years of cosmetic orthodon-
ture, sweet 16. I actively tried to fit the affluent but relatively normal 
world of my hometown into the glow of New York society lights. 

I wanted to reinvent myself as the sophisticate who knew how to 
party. At Yale, it was cool to be educated, to care about John Keats and 
the definition of the sublime and the problems of modern China. I 
tried very hard that year to memorize as many names, definitions and 
theories as I could, just to hold my own in classes. It was, in many ways, 
a year of playing intellectual name games. My Kentucky cousins 
became slightly embarrassing, as did the innocence of my summer 
experiences in the mountains. Although my roommate was joking that 
night in Calhoun, her comment bit deeply into what I thought was a 
well-hidden insecurity about my intelligence and whether or not I was 
qualified to be at Yale. 

In many ways, the past three years at Yale have been about trying to 
reclaim those roots that I so arduously shunned. There has been pain in 
my life in the past few years, and coming to terms with that pain has 
made me want to return to those warm Kentucky nights. It's taken me 
a long time to learn to stop playing intellectual games with everyone 
else and work with the unique perspective that my diverse family background has given me. But, in coming back to my family I have been 
forced to realize the great personal distance that exists between us. I 
don't know much about their lives. They don't know much about mine. 
Even though I am often not able to verbalize it, I am fiercely defensive 
of my Kentucky family. Yet, Kentucky is a part of me with which I can't 
even claim to have been involved for the better part of three years. 

What I can claim to have been very involved with in the last 
three years is my Jewish heritage. My interest in this aspect 
of my life is due to a comment my roommate from Ohio 
made during the second hour of freshman year. She handed me a piece 
of paper the Slifka Center had taped to my door and said, "It's runny, 
I've never lived with a Jew before." I had never really thought of myself 
as a Jew before. I always identified with that side of the family more, 
but religion was more cultural and often left unspoken. It was and is 
difficult to reconcile the conflicting cultures that my parents have raised 
me to identify with. While I definitely have a sense of both sides, only 
engaging half of my identity at any time is difficult. I can never go to 
Kentucky without thinking about Judaism and I can never sit down at 
a seder table without thinking about Kentucky. 

Comments like those that my roommates made freshman year scar 
deeply, if only because I can never claim to be wholly one label or the 
other. The dichotomy is in some ways an evil personal license that 
allows me to remain silent when I want to stand up for my family. I can 
always play the chameleon and pretend that on one day I am not Jewish 
and on another day I am not Kentuckian. But to engage in such a game 
defeats any attempt to reconcile the two. Instead, I shall continue to be 
both the intelligent Jewish coed and the dutiful Kentucky daughter, 
playing each role to its appropriate audience.
