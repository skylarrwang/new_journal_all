EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Annie Barrett :'(SM '01} was 
caught off guard by a flyer 
posted on the kiosk near Elm 
Street at the entrance to Cross 
Campus. "Fag-out" it read in 
bold letters ovet a no-smoking 
symbol and the day's date: 
April 7, 
1998. University 
Health Services had proclaimed 
the date Yale Quit Day. "I 
thought immedi-
ately that some-
one with an ounce 
of wit or someone 
who<l 
gone 
to 
England 
before 
was trying to be 
funny,.. said Bar-
rett. 

The 
sign 
seemed to be a 
play on the double 
meaning of the 
word "fag. • alter-
nately a British 
slang term for cig-
arettes and a slur 
used 
to deride 
homoscmals. 
The poster was 
a complex sign in 
the midst of many other com-
plex signs being bandied about 
on Yale campus. "I wasn't sure 
how to read it," said Barrett. "I 
knew it was an attempt to be 
funny, and I knew I was 
offended, but since the poster 
did not credit a group I wasn't 
sure just how I was supposed to 
read it." In such a situation, 
many might have ignored the 
posters, but Barrett contacted 
University Health Services to 
see if they had sponsored the 
posters in conjunction with 
Yale Quit Day. When they said 
they were not responsible, she 
faced a difficult decision: take 
them down, or leave the posters 
as they were, taCked co the 
kiosks bearing a confusing and 
offensive slur. 

"It was hard for me, but it all 
came down to the fact that 
were anonymous. If there had 
been a name or an organization 
that was responsible, I could 
have sent out an e-
mail/' she said. To 
Barrett the posters' 
anonymity suggest-
ed 
a 
malicious 
intent. Since no 
one wanted to be 
associated 
with 
them, it seemed 
obvious chat the 
person who made 
them 
understOOd 
how they might be 
received. 

'"As the 
situation stood, it 
was dear that it was 
a hate crime. I just 
thought the Yale 
community doesn't 
need to see this." 
Coming to that conclusion, she 
went 
around 
campus 
and 
ripped the posters down. 

T
his incident, unlike that 
of the Consent display, 
was premeditated. Not 
only did the disuibutors of the 
poster design and photocopy 
them ahead of time, but they 
also knew about Yale Quit Day 
and coordinated their efforts 
with that event. Even the ~y 
the posters forged associations 
between the University Health 
Services event and homophobic 
slurs belies a lengthier amount 
of time spent in the produc-
tion of its message. If the 
Consent display incident was 
a bold eraswe, this "Fag-our' 
poster was a campus-wide 
infusion of homophobic sen-
timent. 

As serious as the people 
behind this poster were in 
putting their message out, 
they were nonetheless flip-
pant about where this mes-
sage would go. The posters 
obviously weren't meant to 
do anything except get under 
the collars of people who 
stop to look at kiosks .. The 
· posters provoked 
without 
providing 
forum 
for 
response. In this sense, the 
production of these posters, 
like the destruction of the 
Consent display, was an act 
of confusing negation. We 
are Jeft not only with the 
question, "Why did they 
choose these forms of expres-
sion?'" but also, "Why did 
they bother?" 

Posters, 
after 
aJl. 
are 
advertisements. 
They are 
made to seize our attention. 
If designed .dfectively we 
acwally notice them. We 
find out about the events 
they advertise, even in the 
sea of so many other posters, 
and messages competing for 
ow attention. It is only in 
rare instances that kiosks 
bear the weight of mani-
festos. Colored chalk. in fact, 
seems to be the de facto 
medium of proselytization 
here at Yale. In both cases, 
the 
messages

erased-if nor-:,by rain then by 
patrol 
of university 
employees 
who 
remove 
posters after they've been 
around a while. In both cases 
the message soon disappears. 

The message behind most 
posters is lost quickly, but 
posters that spark controversy 
necessarily linger in the mind. 
Po!.'ters replace posters in an 
endless 
cycle, 
but 
these 
instances of defacement punc-
ruate the seamless process of 
forgetting. These messages 
linger, though not in a way 
that provokes real thought. 

Ultimately 
they 
confuse 
because, though they produce 
messages, their messages are 
unclear and prone to misun-
derstanding. We can attempt 
to interpret. why a person 
might want to tear down a 
Rape Awareness Week display 
or why a person would put up 
posters that slur a large group 
of srudents, but these inci-
dents in and of themselves do 
nor provide us with any clear 
answers. These are not mani-
festos; they're not even com-
mentaries. Though powerful 
in their method of getting our 
attention, these gestures do 
little once they have it. They 
signal the emptiness of what 
they so 
audaciously and 
anonymously have said. -
