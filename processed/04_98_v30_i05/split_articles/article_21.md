homegrown." 
The ideals of Jodie's revolution and the 
ideals for which the Center works are not particularly shocking; 
mainstream politicians 
claim adherence to some of them. Even those 
that sound far-left seem to translate, at least in 
Jodie's mind, to creative community service 
and action rather than armed rebellion. "I 
believe in the equality of people. No person 
has the right to make gain for themselves at 
the expense of someone else. Everyone should 
be able to develop their gifts and talents. I 
believe resources should be distributed by 
work and by need, not by exploitative expropriation. I believe I have more in common 
with my working brother in other countries 
than with the president of GM or Ford 
because he happens to be American." 
Joelle's words sometimes sound canned 
and cribbed from Party documents. This 
makes some sense: she sees herself as continuing a hallowed tradition that still thrives and 
will soon catch on nationwide. She moves 
through the Center with comfort and ease, 
showing it off as if it were her own newly renovated home. "This was all handed down 
through the generations," says Joelle. "Everything is run by volunteers, so there's a continuity of vision and openness, but the programs vary with the needs of the movement 
and the volunteers." Recently, that volunteerism has included the Crisis Information 
Action Center, which led a successful campaign to extend the warning period for electricity shutdowns from three to ten days. 
Jodie's excitement over an extra seven 
days before power shut-offs makes it even 
harder to see her as a leader of the revolution, 
or as part of a movement which is in full 
force. Pride in small steps towards the larger 
goal of economic justice may provide the 
energy to continue the fight, but the degree of 
pride in these small steps attests to the steep 
uphill battle that Joelle and her fellow leftists 
face. Still, as she heads out of the Center after 
a long day, Jodie's smile is less apologetic and 
more confident while she speaks of her successful campaigns. She dons a heavy coat, 
preparing for the cold outside.
