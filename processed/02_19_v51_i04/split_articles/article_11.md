altruism has since reduced its emphasis on earning 
to give. An article published in 2015 on the website 
of 80,000 Hours—an offshoot of the Centre for 
Effective Altruism named for the average number 
of working hours in a person’s life—clariﬁed the 
organization’s stance, asserting that earning to 
give is only one effective path among many. That 
attitude seems to be reﬂected across YEA: Quaade 
is interested in economic development, and none of 
the other ﬁve current or former YEA board members 
I talked to planned to pursue consulting or ﬁnance. 
Shelly Kagan, a Yale ethics professor, outlined a 
more philosophical question the movement faces. 
Since governments are better than individuals at 
enacting change, he wrote in an email, some might 
argue that effective altruists should focus more 
on government reform than individual actions. 
“Roughly, politics, not charity,” he wrote.


Another criticism focuses on the fact that effective 
altruism attracts a disproportionate number of white 
men. Two thirds of the 2,607 respondents to a 2018 
demographics survey on the Effective Altruism 
Forum were male. Seventy-eight percent were 
white, down from a staggering 89 percent in 2017. 
The 2018 survey notes that the drop was likely due to 
an increase in people who opted out of the question, 
not an increase in people from underrepresented 
groups. 


Eui Young Kim, a board member of YEA, 
acknowledged this problem. The movement has 
historically attracted people from “quantitative 
subjects, like cognitive science or math or physics 
or artiﬁcial intelligence,” ﬁelds that are “not exactly 
diverse,” Kim said.


Diversity seems especially important in a 
movement that aims to decide which problems 
are most pressing—a point Monrad acknowledged. 
Diversity helps “avoid blind spots and reduce the 
risk of overlooking important causes or approaches 
to doing good,” he said.


Jessica McCurdy, the other co-president of YEA, 
said that YEA’s members are the type of people who 
enjoy confronting uncomfortable moral questions. 
She described late-night discussions about the trolley 
problem and outlandish moral thought experiments. 
“It’s like, ‘Oh, how do I actually feel about that?” 
she said. “How many chickens is a human life 
worth?”


According to Andersen-Wood, effective altruism 
isn’t a philosophy or a set of answers, but a shared 
project. She and the other effective altruists at Yale 
ﬁnd a unique home in YEA: a secular congregation 
examining the meaning of a moral life.
