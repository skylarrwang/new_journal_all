ate Christison-Lagay grabbed a rubber 
brain off a countertop in the basement of Yale 
School of Medicine’s library and pried its two 
halves apart so that we could have a look inside. As a 
postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Hal Blumenfeld’s research 
lab, Christison-Lagay studies sensory perception, 
which she and her team believe can provide a model 
for human consciousness. She speaks seriously and 
energetically about brains, and clearly knows her way 
around one. After separating one of the lobes, she 
pointed to a small area marked in purple. “Here’s the 
first stop when someone sees something: the primary 
visual cortex,” she said. As she traced her fingertip 
forward through the cerebral cortex, I realized that 
the image of her moving finger was travelling down 
the very same pathway inside my own brain.


Behind glass panels lining the walls around us, 
hundreds of other brains—real human brains—
floated in jars of formaldehyde. Many were whole; 
others had been sliced to pieces like melons. They all 
shone a ghostly white through the ambient yellowish 
solution. A century ago, these brains belonged to 
some of neurosurgery’s first patients. Once transferred 
into jars, they experienced second lives as a reference 
library for brain researchers and doctors. In their 
current incarnation, they form the centerpiece of 
a one-room museum dedicated to the man who 
originally operated on them, and collected them from 
his deceased patients: Dr. Harvey Cushing.


“He was a really big deal,” Christison-Lagay said, 
leading me through the Cushing Center, as the eerie 
underground space is known. “He was able to reduce 
the mortality rate associated with brain surgery from 
around 80 percent to 10 percent.” In addition to the 
brains, the Cushing collection includes thousands 
of glass-plate photographs, microscopic slides, and 
journal notes, testaments to the doctor’s meticulous 
research practices—and the many advances he 
pioneered in modern medicine, both at the operating 
table and in the laboratory.

A couple of weeks after our visit, I sat in a small 
basement room across the street from the Cushing 
Center, staring at a computer screen full of static. 
My chin and forehead rested on padded bars, while a 
pair of adjustable lenses held my gaze from across the 
table. The robotic device, called a pupilometer, was 
learning to read my mind. 


Christison-Lagay and her colleagues in the 
Blumenfeld lab are working on solving one of the 
brain’s greatest mysteries: the physical basis of 
consciousness. They haven’t cut into any actual heads; 
rather, with the help of advanced imaging technology, 
they’ve been able to pinpoint electrical activity within 
the brain almost down to the level of individual 
cells. About a year ago, they published results 
from a breakthrough experiment, which involved 
flashing faces onto a computer screen and recording 
participants’ brain activity in response to the visual 
stimulus with an EEG (electroencephalography) test. 
The researchers are worried, however, that they 
may have switched on more of the brain than they 
intended to. They had asked participants to press a 
button indicating whether or not they had noticed 
the faces popping onto the screen. As a result, the 
researchers can’t be sure how much of the brain signal 
they recorded came from the simple visual perception 
of the face, and how much came from the participants 
mentally preparing to report what they’d seen. 
“We’re potentially conflating two different events,” 
Christison-Lagay explained.


The set of trials I was taking part in was supposed 
to help lay down the groundwork for an improved 
experiment, which the team has dubbed “the 
no-report paradigm.” Through a stream of white noise 
accompanying the fuzziness on the screen, I strained 
my ears to listen out for fleeting sounds, like a whistle, 
a water droplet, or a laser zap. I pressed a button 
whenever I heard something. In the meantime, the 
pupilometer kept tabs on my eyes. According to 
Christison-Lagay, “our pupils change size clearly in 
response to light and the things that we’re seeing, 
but they also change based on our physiological 
arousal state.” In other words, by comparing my pupil 
dilations to the responses I was giving on the keypad, 
the pupilometer was figuring out whether I’d had a 
conscious experience without me having to report it.


Hal Blumenfeld has spent most of his career working 
with epileptic patients, performing surgeries and 
helping to develop treatments. Epileptic seizures often 
involve a disruption of consciousness, and Blumenfeld 
believes that insights into the workings of healthy 
consciousness can “point the way toward possible 
therapies for when consciousness is abnormally 
affected by disease processes.” If a conscious network 
is shut down by a seizure, for example, doctors may 
be able to electrically stimulate that area if they know 
exactly where it is, and turn it back on.


In 1934, Harvey Cushing retired from medical 
practice to New Haven, and brought his brains with 
him. He died four years later, but neurosurgeons 
continued to consult his data base for decades. Once 
CT scans and MRIs hit the scene in the nineteen-
seventies, however, the brains were relegated to 
cramped storage shelves in the basement of the 
School of Medicine dorms, where they received only 
late-night visits from thrill-seeking students. In 1994, 
a Ph.D. student named Christopher Wahl approached 
his advisor about writing a thesis on the historical 
legacy of the brains, and administrators again took 
interest in Cushing’s materials. Since 2010, the 
collection has resided in its quietly lit, wood-paneled 
basement gallery, a kind of portal back in time to when 
humans’ most advanced knowledge of the brain came 
from hand-drawn sketches, photographic negatives of 
misshapen heads, and the organs themselves, spookily 
suspended in formaldehyde. 


Our current understanding of the physical 
basis of consciousness is equally primitive. The 
split-second examples of sensory perception that 
Blumenfeld and his team have studied are a far cry 
from what we consider to be the essence of human 
consciousness, what truly makes us who we are. Even 
when Blumenfeld’s researchers move on into the next 
areas they hope to explore, like motor planning—the 
processes that make us kick a foot out reflexively or 
decide to raise an arm—their findings won’t begin to 
describe the limitless complexities that add up to how 
we each think and feel. Cushing taught modern brain 
researchers that progress comes gradually, through 
careful record-keeping and rigorous analysis. “The 
plan is hopefully to understand as much as possible 
in space and time, what happens during a conscious 
event,” Blumenfeld said. “To drill down to the level 
of hundreds—tens—of milliseconds in order to see 
exactly which neuronal populations are involved in a 
conscious experience.” 


If there’s ever a museum built to commemorate the 
early days of consciousness research, I hope my pupils 
can be found in there somewhere, perhaps floating in 
a jar of formaldehyde.
