rankie Andersen-Wood stood beside a 
projected cartoon of a light bulb with its 
ﬁlament twisted into the shape of a heart. 
In front of her, ﬁve Yale students sat along one side 
of a seminar table. Upbeat pop music played in the 
background. 

“Effective altruism isn’t something you can just 
learn about in two hours,” said Andersen-Wood, 
co-president of Yale Effective Altruism (YEA), going 
off-script from her presentation at YEA’s spring 
information session. She spoke quickly and in a 
soft English accent. “If that were the case, then the 
world would be solved.” 

A social movement that emerged in the late 2000s 
at the University of Oxford, effective altruism aims 
to quantify and maximize the positive impact of 
individuals’ lives. In practice, this means identifying 
the world’s most urgent issues—those chosen by 
adherents include global poverty, animal suffering, 
climate change, and artiﬁcial intelligence—and 
recommending the most efﬁcient responses. The 
movement recommends careers based on their social 
beneﬁt and assesses charitable donations based on 
their impact and cost-efﬁciency. 

The most active local effective altruism groups—
YEA among them—are at elite colleges like Oxford, 
Harvard, Stanford, and Yale, or in large cities like 
London and Boston. According to Andersen-Wood, 
the YEA mailing list includes about seven hundred 
students and recent graduates, although only twenty-
ﬁve are actively involved. YEA hosts speakers and 
career workshops, holds social events, and runs a 
semester-long fellowship designed to introduce Yale 
students to effective altruism.

A week before her presentation, I met Andersen-
Wood at Blue State Coffee on York. She sat in an 
armchair by the window, balancing a balsamic-
glazed tofu sandwich on her lap. Andersen-Wood is 
vegan and majoring in political science. This is not 
an unusual set of characteristics for Yale’s effective 
altruists (or, as Anderson-Wood prefers, “aspiring 
effective altruists”). Many follow animal-free diets; 
the majority study political science, philosophy, or a 
STEM ﬁeld. Effective altruism also inﬂuences other 
facets of Andersen-Wood’s life: “what I buy and what 
I don’t buy, where I donate, if I donate, how often I 
donate, how much I donate, career choices.”

Aaron Gertler, who graduated in 2015, founded 
YEA during his senior year at Yale. Now, he works 
in communications at the Centre for Effective 
Altruism. He also keeps a personal blog, where he 
publishes his charitable donations; he gives ten 
percent of his income to charity every year, primarily 
to effective altruism organizations and the Against 
Malaria Foundation. 

Joshua Monrad, the former co-president of YEA, 
arrived at Yale planning to study psychology. But 
under the inﬂuence of effective altruism, he switched 
majors to Ethics, Politics, and Economics, and now 
hopes to work in public health after college. 

“I think I would have grown frustrated if I had felt 
like I wasn’t in the best path for helping others,” he 
told me over Skype. Monrad is from Denmark, but 
this semester he’s studying abroad at Oxford, the 
philosophy’s birthplace. Still, he acknowledges that 
being a perfect effective altruist is an ideal, not a 
reality.

“As an international student, I ﬂy all over the 
world, which is expensive and emits a lot of carbon,” 
he said. “There are a lot of things that I own, that 
on a very extreme conception of effective altruism, 
I maybe didn’t have to own.” Effective altruism, he 
said, encourages him to think more about these 
issues, and to try harder to mitigate them.

The effective altruists at Yale seem wary of their 
public perception. In an email responding to my 
interview request, Monrad warned, “I have a tendency 
to be quite careful about how I represent effective 
altruism,” citing experiences with “unfortunate 
misconceptions about what the broader effective 
altruism movement is and what it involves.”

One point of controversy is effective altruism’s 
relationship with “earning to give,” the strategy of 
pursuing a high-paying job in order to donate more 
to charity. Especially early in its development, the 
effective altruism movement gained a reputation for 
recommending careers on Wall Street. But according 
to Sebastian Quaade, YEA’s strategy advisor, effective
