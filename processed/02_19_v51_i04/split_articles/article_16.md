“T
his house is 115 years old,” Sal 
DeCola said as he guided me into 
a bright sunroom overlooking deep 
blue waters. It was one o’clock in the afternoon, 
clear skies, and low tide. We stood in DeCola’s 
home in Morris Cove, a neighborhood on 
the east bank of New Haven Harbor that he 
represents as an alder. The waves pushed up 
against a dark concrete barrier extending below 
the other dozen houses along the beach. DeCola 
patted the wall of the house and grinned widely. 
“It made it through the great storm of ’38, and all 
of the other ones in between to Sandy.” 

Not all of Morris Cove has fared well in foul 
weather. “When it floods, water runs along 
Lighthouse Road and Townsend Avenue,” 
DeCola said, holding out a map of the Morris 
Cove ward. He pointed inland from the shore, 
gesturing toward the center of the neighborhood. 
“And then there’s Dean Street—used to get so 
bad you could row a rowboat up Dean Street.”

In Fair Haven, just north of Morris Cove, 
historic sections of the neighborhood regularly 
flood during heavy thunderstorms. Places near 
the Mill River, like Criscuolo Park, are especially 
at risk. “My friends brought their kids to the 
playground, and water was covering the whole 
area—a whole foot of water,” Chris Ozyck, a 
resident of Fair Haven, told me. “The playground 
was built just last year.” Other floods have blocked 
off some of Fair Haven’s nine points of entry, 
Ozyck said, forcing vehicles to take longer routes.

Hurricanes along the Connecticut seaboard 
cause storm surges—temporary rises in sea 
level—in the Sound. The worst flooding occurs 
when they coincide with high tide. New Haven 
dodged a bullet during Hurricane Sandy: the 
peak storm surge happened just two hours 
before high tide. “Had Sandy arrived two hours 
later, we would have had an extra two feet of 
water.” recalled Giovanni Zinn, head of the city 
engineering department. “We would have been 
in really deep trouble.”

For coastal communities like New Haven, 
flooding is the most urgent threat of climate 
change. Rising sea levels and increased rain and 
snowfall overload drainage systems, especially in 
places at low elevation. In 2016, residents and 
more than thirty coalition groups concerned 
about climate change petitioned Mayor Toni 
Harp for the city to update its 2004 Climate Action 
Plan, which focused only on curbing greenhouse 
gas emissions. In January 2018, the city adopted 
a much broader plan called the New Haven 
Climate & Sustainability Framework. Over 
thirty residents and stakeholders participated in 
six focus groups—on electric power, buildings, 
transportation, materials management, land use 
and green infrastructure, and food—that worked 
to address climate change and other sustainability 
challenges facing the city. 

While the plan doesn’t enforce policy changes 
or increase government funding, it provides 
a wide-ranging set of recommendations. The 
authors advised the city to adopt a tax or ban on 
single-use plastic items, hire an energy expert, 
and implement a new ordinance to incorporate 
green building practices. The document also 
details ways residents can contribute, such as 
riding mass transit and decreasing outdoor water 
use. “It’s not just a plan for what municipalities 
should do,” Zinn said. “It’s really a plan for what 
the community at large can do.”

Like the 2004 plan, which was partly spurred 
by the U.S.’s decision to back out of negotiations 
on the Kyoto Protocol in 2001, New Haven’s 2018 
plan responds to federal environmental policy—
in particular, President Trump’s decision to back 
out of the Paris Agreement. “Municipalities 
and state governments need to, and—in some 
cases—are stepping up,” Justin Elicker told me 
during a meeting at Yale’s Kroon Hall, where the 
School of Forestry & Environmental Studies is 
headquartered. Elicker served on the Board of 
Alders from 2009 to 2013. For the past five years, 
he directed the New Haven Land Trust. In mid-
January, he entered the 2019 mayoral race with 
environmental concerns as a key plank of his 
platform.

So far, the framework has inspired some action. 
Over two hundred bioswales have been installed 
in the regions of downtown sloped towards the 
water, which are most prone to flooding. These 
colorful three-by-five foot patches of sidewalk, 
filled with clusters of flowers and green grass, 
filter stormwater and reduce the rate at which 
it enters the sewer system. Additionally, with 
an $8 million state grant, the Long Wharf and 
East Shore neighborhoods are each establishing 
“living shorelines,” which combine intertidal 
marshes and rock sills to reinforce the fragile coast. 
But some residents and groups expected more 
from the city’s new plan. “It’s not just a ‘report,’” said 
Chris Schweitzer. “It’s meant to be implemented.” 
Schweitzer is a local environmental activist and lead 
organizer of the New Haven Climate Movement, 
a grassroots organization that strives to raise 
awareness about climate change and call residents 
to action. When I met with him in mid-November, 
snow was falling fast outside. “Even this amount of 
precipitation, this early on in the year, is abnormal,” 
he noted. According to the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, annual precipitation 
in New Haven has consistently exceeded the 
national average since the nineteen-eighties. From 
2010 to 2014, Connecticut experienced a higher 
number of extreme precipitation events — defined 
as storms with over two inches of rainfall — than 
it had in any five-year period since NOAA began 
recording state data in the nineteen-fifties.

Schweitzer believes the city’s current efforts 
are only a start. “I don’t have a problem with 
bioswales—they’re great things,” he said. “But 
we need to have an equally robust response to 
greenhouse gases.” The framework includes an 
interim goal of reducing the city’s greenhouse gas 
emissions to 55 percent of 1999 levels by 2030. 
The city will need to enact aggressive policies to 
meet this goal. Money is a limiting factor. Installing 
smart electricity meters in buildings, expanding 
sidewalk infrastructure, creating a revolving fund in 
the city budget for energy efficiency projects—each 
suggestion requires significant funding. Although 
bioswales in New Haven cost only $15,000—half 
the cost in New York City—even relatively small 
expenditures are a burden for a city $1.5 billion in 
debt.

“A lot of it is waiting for disaster to happen, 
then funding happens—a somewhat reactionary 
of looking at it,” said Zinn, the city engineer. The 
floodgates at the dam of Morris Cove account for 
sea level rises of only thirteen feet. If the tides rise 
higher, the neighborhood could flood. Just last year, 
a seawall collapsed in Quinnipiac River Park at the 
eastern edge of Fair Haven. The area subsequently 
flooded. 

Elicker has several ideas about how the city 
could better address climate change. Encouraging 
Yale to pay money into the CTtransit system 
instead of maintaining its own shuttle system 
could eliminate a redundant transportation system 
and increase overall ridership. Elicker sees this as 
an environmental issue on top of a social justice 
issue. “It’s unethical that you have Yale shuttle, 
that brings all of the Yale-affiliated people to their 
destination.” said Elicker. “And then overlapping 
many of those routes is CTtransit, which is for 
everyone else.” Establishing internal carbon taxes, 
which charge departments based on their monthly 
carbon emissions, could incentivize municipal 
departments. Elicker also points out that New 
Haven could join cities throughout the country, 
from Ann Arbor to New London, CT, which are 
divesting from fossil fuels.

As a climate activist, Schweitzer said he is frustrated 
by the general lack of awareness and participation 
by the community. In September, 350 CT, the New 
Haven Climate Movement, and other Connecticut 
environmental organizations held a climate rally 
on the Green to demand environmental justice and 
renewable energy. “There were 250 people total at 
the event.” Schweitzer shook his head. “250 people, 
2018. Do people not get it?” 

Elicker acknowledges Schweitzer’s frustration, 
but also recognizes that “people are worried about 
putting food on the table, getting a job, crime in 
their neighborhoods, and climate change is not 
on the forefront of their mind as an issue.” Still, 
he says, climate change is “the crisis of our time,” 
and city officials “need to play a leadership role in 
thinking both short-term and long-term.”
