A GOOD HAT IS HARD TO FIND

“A 
hat is a timeless piece,” Ben 
DelMonico declares. The manager of 
New Haven’s DelMonico Hatter sits 
across from me in Java Café with a mint tea, tapping 
the visor of his grey wool baseball cap. His hat — a 
Wigens, he informs me — complements his crisp 
button-down and grey wool sweater. Ben chooses his 
words carefully, massaging one hand with the other as 
he focuses on a point over my shoulder. The 44-year-old 
New Haven native isn’t used to being interviewed. The 
last news coverage of the business was in 2017, when 
the New Haven Independent showed up to document 
an unusual customer: a possibly-rabid possum, which 
Ben had to call the police to remove. The possum 
might have made a good hat, but it certainly wasn’t 
going to buy one. 

In the early twentieth century, there were twenty-
seven hat stores in New Haven. Now there is only 
one. Established in 1908 by Ernest DelMonico, 
senior, DelMonico Hatter sits at 47 Elm Street, a 
block southeast of the Green, between a menswear 
shop and a rubber stamp store. Ben is part of the 
fourth generation of DelMonico hatters –– his father 
and grandfather spent their whole careers behind the 
counter. As a young boy, Ben helped out in the store 
over the Christmas holidays, but he didn’t return to 
it until about ﬁve years ago, when his father, Ernest, 
asked him to come home to help run the business. 
Since Ernest’s death last year, Ben has taken charge.

From the street, you might mistake the store for a tea 
parlor. A large, colorful sign graced by an enthusiastic 
Mad Hatter hangs in front. Displays of carefully-posed 
hats in the windows hearken back to a time when one 
may have casually left one’s derby on the dressing table 
or one’s bowler on the baby grand. DelMonico’s stocks 
forty-seven types of hats, from sombreros to skullcaps. 
You, too, can suavely drop their names (Tricorne, 
anyone? How about a pork pie?) by consulting the 
store’s newly updated online glossary, designed to act 
as translator for a younger crowd unfamiliar with hat 
lingo. When you do, you will learn, shockingly, that 
the ﬁrst incarnation of a beret debuted in the Bronze 
Age, and, less shockingly, that “the core purpose of the 
helmet has remained the same, to protect the head 
from injury.”

Ben’s desk is at the back of the store, behind 
labyrinthine rows of hat racks and hatboxes. 
DelMonico’s assistant manager, Christina Urdanivia, 
and retailer, Vijor McCray, huddle around a countertop 
computer opposite him. All three are on the phone 
with customers. “What was your last size? What color?” 
they ask. One hat is going to South Africa.

When she ﬁnishes her call, Christina offers to show 
me the back of the shop, where they resize, steam, and 
ﬂatten hats. Behind Ben’s desk, we enter a museum of 
perfectly preserved millinery equipment. Lining one 
New Haven’s lone hat shop recalls a bygone era.

wall are small wooden busts of head circumferences, 
disk-shaped, almost like tree rings. Christina points to 
the hat-steaming machine, a voluminous, aluminum 
mushroom cap connected to a shaft. They don’t do 
as much in-store repair work, she tells me; they don’t 
do much in-store business, period. Ernest DelMonico 
wisely embraced the dot com boom in the early 2000s, 
ahead of the curve for the hat world. Most of their sales 
are online, with clients from out-of-town and abroad. 
People just don’t wear hats the way they used to, 
Ben explains. The turning point for hat culture in the 
U.S., he says, was January 20, 1961: John F. Kennedy’s 
inauguration. Kennedy was the last President-elect to 
emerge from his motorcade wearing a top hat. After he 
was sworn in, Kennedy, one of the most photographed 
men in the country, seldom donned a hat. The 
public subsequently christened him “Hatless Jack.” 
The majority of American men put their hats on the 
shelf, and the industry petered out. Now, hat-wearers 
in America are an eclectic group, equal parts ardent 
traditionalists and bold statement makers.

Ben manages DelMonico’s daily operations, and 
Christina, a ﬁve-year veteran of the industry, provides 
abundant enthusiasm. (She tells me, “You need to 
ﬁnd the right hat for the shape of the face, but also the 
right brim, the right color.”) Vijor, age twenty-two, is 
the entrepreneur. While I talk to her, she deftly runs 
through shipping receipts, organizing and cataloguing 
them. She’s wearing a sleek black tracksuit and her 
hair is pulled into a neat ponytail. It’s only her fourth 
day on the job, but she’s already cased the joint, and 
she has ambitious plans for the business’ future. “Our 
new photo shoots are going to be bold, daring,” she 
says decisively. “I think hats, all different kinds, should 
appeal to a younger clientele.” 

The homburg, for instance, may be staging a 
resurgence. It has a tipped-up brim and a deﬁned center 
dent. First popularized in the 1890s by King Edward 
VII of England, it is known as the “Godfather Hat,” 
after Marlon Brando in the movies. It’s also the hat of 
choice for one of DelMonico’s most loyal customers, 
Ramblin’ Dan, a popular Connecticut bluegrass player 
and the proud owner of a DelMonico white straw 
homburg with a small feather in the cap. He wears it 
all the time, according to a post on his blog. When he 
ﬁrst left the store with it, he reports, a man across Elm 
Street shouted “NICE HAT!” 

Dan isn’t the only local celebrity who gets his 
headwear from DelMonico’s: Mayor Toni Harp has 
been in a few times, usually to buy a Betmar, Ben tells 
me. Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, of Connecticut’s 
third district, recently purchased a Borsalino. On one 
occasion, Yale President Peter Salovey dropped in to

buy a traditional straw-brimmed Panama hat. 

Local customers are appreciative of the store’s 
history. That’s what matters to Calista Washburn, Ben 
DelMonico’s niece, who will start college at Yale in 
the fall. She helped out over the Christmas vacation, 
the store’s busiest time of year. “So many people came 
in and told me about buying hats from my great-
grandfather,” Calista tells me over the phone. I ask her 
if she wears hats herself. “To be fully honest, I don’t 
like hats. Maybe the odd baseball cap,” she confesses. 
“My grandfather, though—now there was a gentleman 
who really wore hats.”

A happy customer leaving DelMonico’s has to 
weave through rows of classic hats –– a reminder that 
they’ve just bought into a history of sophistication and 
elegance. Walking out, I think of Rosalind Russell, the 
1940s ﬁlm star in “His Girl Friday.” She plays a gutsy 
female reporter with a silk-padded chevron-striped top 
hat — one I could see on a bolder version of myself.
