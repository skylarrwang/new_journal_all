**Title: FIVE BEERS DEEP AT THE UNION STATION SBARRO**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Right outside the Sbarro, near the bottom 
of the escalator in New Haven’s Union 
Station, tucked around a corner like a rarely-
played side quest in a video game, is a sign from 
another universe. It says, “Buy 4 Beers, Get the 5th 
for a Penny.”

Now, I can imagine a universe in which I would 
order one beer at the Union Station Sbarro. A 
universe in which it’s a quarter past five, say, and my 
train home is delayed by yet another hour, and all 
I’m looking to do is numb the existential anguish of 
being an Amtrak customer. Then I might walk past 
Sbarro — a pizza chain that has gone bankrupt twice 
and is best known for its omnipresence in mall food 
courts — and think, “Huh, I guess they have beer.” 
And then, maybe if there was a two-for-one special, I 
could, under extreme duress, be convinced to order 
a second. 
But five beers—again, at the Union Station Sbarro, 
a restaurant even more depressing than a regular 
Sbarro—is crazy. It is, in my view, the absolute saddest 
experience one could have in a train station, up to 
and including being struck by an actual train.

From the moment I learned of this special, I knew 
I could not die without trying it.

I finally got the chance one bone-chillingly cold 
MLK Day, when my friend Julia and I trekked all 
the way to the train station for that very purpose. I 
brought Julia for two reasons. One, because I needed 
a second person to carry on valiantly in case this stunt 
killed me. And two, because everyone should have a 
friend they immediately identify as the ideal partner 
for getting belligerent at a Sbarro, and Julia is that 
person for me. 

Icicles spiked from dead tree trunks like an early 
2000’s hairstyle. The temperature hit negative three. 
I was genuinely thrilled to reach the relative warmth 
and comfort of Sbarro. The walls were the bracing 
greenish-yellow of an overboiled egg yolk. At the 
counter, we immediately fucked up by ordering 
draft beers, which are apparently not subject to The 
Deal. The cashier—a no-nonsense guy, which must 
have been tough when confronted with two people 
as committed to nonsense as we were—eventually 
relented. In a transaction I still don’t fully understand, 
he charged me $16 for a solo cup full (and I mean 
full) of beer, with the understanding that the payment 
entitled me to three more refills and eventually a can 
or bottle for “free.” That was disappointing, since I 
really wanted to buy the fifth one with a ceremonial 
penny. 

We sat at a table in the back corner. When I set my 
Allagash down it trembled and then spilled over the 
lip of the solo cup, pooling weakly on the marbled 
vinyl of the tabletop.

To my surprise we were not the only ones drinking 
in Sbarro. A balding Jason Statham–type sat down 
across from us and tucked into a slice of sausage pizza 
and two miniature bottles of red wine, one of which 
he poured into a plastic cup with “Miller Lite” written 
on its side. I heard a woman ask, “If I get a beer do 
I have to drink it right now?” Two women wearing 
pom-pom hats—one said “BRUINS” on it—sipped 
from solo cups. 

At 5:42 everyone left except for us.

At 5:43 I mentioned I was “feeling it” and Julia 
called me a lightweight.

When we finished our second round we went back 
to the counter and discovered there had been a shift 
change. The new cashier, Oscar, was friendlier and 
younger, with arms coated in tattoos. We tried to 
explain what we had paid for, what we had received, 
and what we were still owed. We mostly failed, but 
somehow each ended up with the rest of our beers 
anyway: a Half-Full Pale Ale, a Blood Orange Pale 
Ale, a Shock Top Belgian White, a Modelo, a Two 
Hearted Ale, a Fat Tire Pale Ale, a Corona, and a 
Lagunitas 12th of Never Ale. Sbarro, I must say, has 
a shockingly extensive beer selection. I asked Oscar 
how often people do The Deal. “People do it a lot. 
Especially on Fridays,” he said. Then he sold Julia a 
slice of pizza that normally cost $6.50 for $4.

“It’s crazy when chains make deals with you,” 
Julia said as we sat down with our bounty. “Like, this 
Sbarro is so off-grid that they’re just like, ‘I’ll give you 
this for $2.50.’” 

By now I thought I had a sense of the place: patrons 
came and went according to the rhythms of the train 
schedule, and plenty of them were down to indulge in 
a drink. What I didn’t see was anyone sticking around 
long enough to drink five beers. Most only stayed for 
twenty minutes.

Time passed. We drank our beers. A woman next 
to us asked how Julia’s Fat Tire was. I went to the 
bathroom, which smelled like candy and the memory 
of vomit. I heard the loudspeaker announce a train to 
Boston South Station, and I thought about how easily 
I could get on it and go home. I ate a slice of pizza 
soaked through with grease. I watched The Bachelor 
on the wall-mounted TV. And I talked to Julia: about 
food and sex and insecurities and our families. It turns 
out getting drunk at Sbarro isn’t that functionally 
different from getting drunk anywhere else.

Eventually the place started to clear out. “I hope 
they don’t close on us,” Julia said. “I want them to 
kick us out for drunk and disorderly conduct.” 

At 9:48 a security guard sat down and asked what 
we were working on. “I’m writing a piece about 
getting drunk at Sbarro,” I said, and then we all tried 
to determine if The Deal was a good deal or not. He 
thought that it probably was. I finished my last beer at 
9:50. We had been at Sbarro for more than four and a 
half hours. Shifts changed, customers came and went, 
but we stayed on. We might have scammed them. I’m 
not really sure.
