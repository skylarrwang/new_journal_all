As our meeting ended, Elicker showed me a map 
published by the Nature Conservancy, a national 
environmental nonprofit, projecting future sea 
levels for New Haven in 2080. On the map, dark 
blue, light blue, and lighter blue-green pixels 
scatter along the coastline and spill over the banks 
of the city’s rivers. The darker the shade, the higher 
the flooding levels estimated for that area. Long 
Wharf, Union Station, and IKEA are under light or 
medium blue. English Station, the old power plant, 
is dark blue—gone. Across New Haven Harbor, 
Tweed Airport, Morris Cove, and Fort Hale Park 
are also under a layer of dark blue, as are the Port of 
New Haven’s petroleum tanks, the city’s wastewater 
treatment plant, and Route 1, all east of Downtown. 
Consequences of a storm event in that area could be 
catastrophic. “The amount of pollution that would 
go into the harbor…” Elicker’s voice trailed off.
In Morris Cove, DeCola and I stepped outside 
onto the porch for a better look at the waters. He 
took a deep breath of air and sighed. “It’s beautiful 
when the sun is shining, and the wind is blowing 
the boats,” he said. So far, the residents that live in 
houses along the cove have been lucky: the storms 
that have threatened in the past haven’t coincided 
with high tide. Although disaster prevention 
measures, like seawalls, may keep the city dry for 
now, New Haven and other coastal cities around 
the world are depending on large-scale emissions 
reductions to stay afloat. Below us, the waves gently 
lap against the concrete wall. As DeCola reminds 
me, “It’s all about the timing.”
