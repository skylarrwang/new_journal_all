“No matter how serious Pike’s 
neglect of student rental properties 
has been, David Corliss believes 
that New Haveners have it worse.“
According to the Independent, at least one child living in 
a Pike apartment on Chapel St. had significant levels of 
lead in their blood. Pike agreed to a $121,000 settlement 
with the EPA.
John DeStefano, who served as New Haven’s mayor 
from 1994 to 2014 and is now a political science 
lecturer at Yale, told me that Pike’s business strategy 
is to target the significant population of Yale students 
moving off-campus. According to the Yale Daily News, 
about 25 percent of upperclassmen lived off-campus 
in 2009. The proportion increased to 34.1 percent of 
upperclassmen––43.5 percent of seniors and just under 
a quarter of juniors––by the fall of 2018. “Pike has made 
a market decision to invest in properties adjacent to the 
campus or to the Yale shuttle stops,” DeStefano said. 
Lipschitz said that Pike staff help orient students, who 
are typically first-time renters, to the leasing process. 
“Our leasing dept [sic] has over one hundred years of 
collective experience assisting first time renters transition 
into their first private dwelling space,” he wrote.
Lopez and her housemates received no assistance of 
that sort. 


At 9 a.m. on a crisp Tuesday morning in January, I 
perched on the kitchen stool at the Pike-owned Theta 
house while Lopez fried eggs on the stove. After breakfast, 
she took me on a tour of the property, her heeled black 
boots echoing throughout the home. 
We started at the top floor of the spacious three-story 
home. Next to a skylight, an approximately four-foot-
long, mildewy orange water stain scarred the third floor 
ceiling. The stain, presumably caused by a roof leak, 
first appeared nearly a year ago. Lopez said that Pike has 
repeatedly promised to fix it and then failed to appear.
Passing through the living room, we descended to the 
boiler room in the basement. Surrounded by crumbling 
brick and cobwebs in the hot, humid darkness, I felt a drop 
of condensation drip onto my cheek. “It’s literally fucking 
Stranger Things down here,” said Lopez, laughing.
The heat has been spontaneously shutting down several 
times a month for the past year. Lopez first emailed Pike 
about the heat on Saturday, November 11, 2017. Pike 
promised to have the heater fixed on December 4. On 
December 5, Carroll Yanicelli, a Theta-employed liaison 
between the students and Pike, emailed Lopez and told 
her that Pike had sent an employee to fix the problem. 
“There should be steady and ongoing heat,” Yanicelli 
wrote in an email.
In late December of 2018, the boiler began to shut 
off sporadically again. Whenever this happens, Lopez has 
to go downstairs every four hours to reset the heat. The 
issue has yet to be resolved, despite repeated emails from 
Theta to Pike’s representatives. Raphael Ramos, Deputy 
Director of the Livable City Initiative, a city housing 
agency, said that when tenants repeatedly reset their 
furnaces, it can increase the risk of a small explosion.


No matter how serious Pike’s neglect of student rental 
properties has been, David Corliss believes that New 
Haveners have it worse. In the summer of 2016, Corliss, 
then an attorney at Flood Law Firm, moved into a Pike 
apartment leasing for $900 a month on Chapel Street. In 
November, as temperatures dropped, Corliss tried to turn 
on the heat. But the radiators stayed cold. 
Corliss bought a space heater and wrapped himself 
and his cat in layers of blankets and comforters. He 
called and sent multiple emails to Pike, but they never 
came to make repairs. After a week of unbearable cold, 
Corliss took a day off from work to go to Pike’s office. He 
stood in the lobby until an administrator confirmed that 
a contractor was going to fix his radiator. Only then did a 
Pike employee visit his apartment to repair the heat.
A week later, the radiator broke down again. When 
Pike failed to respond to his messages and calls, Corliss, 
frustrated, decided to withhold his rent. “I won’t pay rent 
for an apartment that doesn’t have heat,” Corliss said. 
Pike responded with a warning: if Corliss didn’t pay his 
rent, he could face eviction. In February, only seven 
months after moving in, Corliss vacated the Chapel 
Street apartment.
The legalities of housing may appear murky even to 
experienced renters like Corliss. Yonatan Zamir, a staff 
attorney at New Haven Legal Assistance who specializes 
in housing cases, said that tenants don’t receive enough 
information on the renting process. “People don’t 
necessarily know what their rights are,” said Zamir. “That 
applies to the student population as well. No matter how 
educated you are, you may not have ever been educated 
about entering a new lease.”
According to Zamir, the most common mistake 
tenants make is withholding rent. “Don’t withhold your 
rent until you’ve gone to great lengths,” he said. “A lease 
is a contract. If you don’t want a landlord to come after 
you in court, and sully things up for you legally, you want 
to avoid that by protecting yourself.” When issues arise, 
tenants should keep paying rent and screenshot relevant 
emails, save letters, and take photographs for evidence, 
Zamir said. If the problem persists, tenants can go to 
small claims court with proof. 
The most common form of tenant exploitation, Zamir 
added, is withholding security deposits. New Haven’s 
apartments have a high turnover rate, and some landlords 
try to squeeze extra money from their properties by 
unfairly withholding security deposits after tenants move 
out. 
“Turnover is a great way to make money in the housing 
market,” Zamir said. “They say, ‘You trashed the place, 
and I had to spend $1,000 cleaning it up.’ Next thing you 
know, your security deposit is gone.”
Taylor, a Yale senior, signed a lease on a Pike property 
for last academic year. (Taylor uses they/them pronouns. 
Their name has been changed.) In August of 2017, they 
entered a house in disrepair. No hot water came from the 
taps for the first two weeks, the stairs were “falling apart,” 
and by spring, rats had infested the kitchen. 
Last July, after their lease had ended, Taylor emailed 
Lipschitz about their security deposit of several thousand 
dollars. Lipschitz promised that the funds would be 
returned within the next few days. Two months later, on 
September 23, Taylor emailed Lipschitz again. That day, 
Lipschitz responded that he would look into the matter. 
Since then, Taylor has had no contact with him. Pike still 
has not returned the security deposit. 
In August, Taylor began renting a house from Farnam 
Realty Group, a real estate company that manages around 
six hundred properties and was founded by former Pike 
employee Carol Horsford in 2014. “In some ways,” Taylor 
said, “[Farnam is] the opposite of Pike.”
Before Horsford gives tenants their keys, she makes 
them sit through a brief PowerPoint presentation about 
their leasing rights. The presentation includes three 
sections, titled “Basic Home Maintenance,” “How to 
be a Good Tenant,” and “How to be a Good Neighbor.” 
Student tenants who rent from Pike, such as Melissa, a 
Yale senior, say their experience with Pike began very 
differently. (Melissa’s name has been changed.)
“I don’t think they did anything instructive,” Melissa 
said. “There was a lot of negotiation with the lease 
because we didn’t want the wool to be pulled over our 
eyes.”
Melissa said her housing manager told her Pike plans 
to increase the rent on her apartment by 10 percent next 
year. She’s moving out, but she is certain that another 
group of unknowing Yale students will move into the 
apartment, even with its malfunctioning heating system, 
perpetually clogged drains, and raccoon infestation. She 
herself had ignored friends’ warnings to stay away when 
she started leasing from Pike in August. Melissa said she 
felt she didn’t have much choice, given her budget. “Pike 
is going to find people who are gonna pay for it,” she said, 
“and the whole cycle is going to continue.”
