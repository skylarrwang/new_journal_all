matter. 

But sometimes Zirpolo talks like there’s something 
transcendent about the whole thing. Like when he 
was chopping garlic in his central Connecticut 
home, and I asked him over the phone about the 
kinds of sensations he can only feel in a balloon. 
He stopped the slicing, thought for a second, 
then answered by telling me what he tells nervous 
potential passengers: 

“This is what it feels like to be in a balloon. Sit 
in a kitchen chair, next to a window. Look out the 
window, and your eyes can see—but your body does 
not feel—the ground move away from the building 
you’re in. There’s no rocking sensation. You just look 
out the window, and you’re watching the ground 
move away. You don’t feel that the building you’re 
in is now moving one way or the other. It looks like 
somebody just, very slowly, picked it up—you didn’t 
feel them pick it up, it just happened, and all of a 
sudden the ground started moving underneath you. 
“If I sit you in a balloon basket,” he continued, 
“and put a blindfold on you, other than the fact that 
you hear the burner roaring above your head, I can 
make it so you couldn’t even feel yourself leaving 
the ground. You can’t get that feeling anywhere else, 
with anything. Airplanes, helicopters—any other 
flying machine besides the balloon makes a hell of 
a racket.” 

Zirpolo is flying in the age of Icarus while the rest 
of us are flying United. 


Joseph Montgolfier, the inventor of the hot air 
balloon, was such a layabout that his descendants 
call toilet paper papier de Joseph the way the rest 
of France calls hot air balloons montgolfières. “A 
dreamer and a maverick,” Charles Gillispie called 
him in his history of ballooning, The Montgolfier 
Brothers and the Invention of Aviation. “The very 
type of the inventor, imaginative with objects and 
processes, impractical in business and affairs.”

In 1782, stricken with boredom while attending 
a “diploma mill” in Avignon, Joseph built a three-
by-four-foot thin wooden frame, stretched a piece 
of taffeta cloth over it, and lit a few scraps of paper 
underneath. The lighter-than-air contraption hit 
the ceiling. He immediately wrote to his brother, 
Etienne, “Get in a supply of taffeta and of cordage, 
quickly, and you will see one of the most astonishing 
sights in the world.” 

Joseph and Etienne, inheritors of a paper mill, 
soon became the Wright Brothers of ballooning. 
They started on their path to national acclaim in 
the summer of 1783, which they spent terrorizing 
the French countryside with experimental balloons. 
Powered by burning straw, their unmanned paper 
constructions almost always incinerated upon 
returning to earth. The few that didn’t suffered at 
the hands of peasants who thought the glowing, 
zigzagging orbs were the work of the Devil. 

The montgolfières caught the attention of the 
French crown, however. At Versailles, King Louis 
XVI, suspecting a flying ball of fire might have 
some military applications, watched closely as the 
Montgolfier brothers exhibited their invention 
with appropriate pomp and circumstance. At 
the first cannon blast, a sheep, duck, and rooster 
marched into the balloon basket; at the second, the 
animals ascended six hundred meters in the air and 
absconded from the royal palace. Impressed, the 
king thought prisoners should be sent up next. 

One observer of the Versailles test was Jean-
François Pilâtre de Rozier, a twenty-six-year-old 
who had already made his name in science-
obsessed Paris, the Silicon Valley of its day. During 
public lectures sponsored by the king’s brother, he 
wowed Parisian elites by exhaling hydrogen onto 
a candle and breathing fire. He also tested a self-
made respirator by lying on a pile of dung for thirty 
minutes. After watching the montgolfière drift away, 
Pilâtre followed the quacking and crowing to a 
spot in the Wood of Vaucresson, three and a half 
kilometers from the launch site, where he found the 
royal animals alive and relatively unscathed. Soon 
afterwards, he volunteered for the Montgolfiers’ 
first manned experiments. Pilâtre hoped ballooning 
would increase his standing in a nation captivated 
by scientific spectacle. 


A hundred ninety-seven years later, in 1980, 
Robert Zirpolo got into ballooning to impress a girl. 
He was courting an airplane pilot-in-training, and 
thought a balloon ride might be his “in.” He was 
wrong. “It bored the crap out of her,” he said. Their 
first time as passengers, there was little wind, and lots 
of heat. They hovered in place, landed in the woods, 
and had to haul balloon and basket a hundred yards 
to the nearest road. 

Zirpolo was in his early twenties at the time. 
He worked at an oyster bar in Kingfield, Maine, 
a ski town at the base of Sugarloaf Mountain. 
Kingfielders didn’t plan their social calls; everyone 
bumped into everyone else on the mountain. Most 
mornings, he’d ski down gently curving slopes and 
take in the beauty of his chosen home, a world away 
from his native Queens. “I miss that like nobody can 
understand,” he said. 

He kept ballooning after that first flight, learning 
how to fly from a master in Portland. At least, he 
tried to. Flying, according to Zirpolo, involves skills 
and instincts that develop over years, even decades. 
“When I started flying, nobody told me I was ever 
going to start landing in cul-de-sacs with below-
ground power lines, or on a street, or a backyard, 
or a front yard. That wasn’t part of the training,” he 
said. “Good experience is obtained through bad 
decisions.” 

In 1981, Zirpolo injured his knee as a passenger 
in a single-engine plane crash, and had to recover at 
a friend’s house in Southington, Connecticut. He 
brought his balloon with him. Walking long distances 
was challenging, but he could still stand in a basket 
and operate a burner. One of the first people to fly 
over the state as commercial ballooning took off in 
the ’80s, Zirpolo attracted emergency responders 
concerned about his fire-breathing flying machine, 
including, once, a Waterbury cop who arrested him 
after landing because, Zirpolo remembers the officer 
saying, “this must be illegal.” (It wasn’t; Waterbury 
police quickly released him.) Yet the unusual craft 
“ON DIFFERENT 
FLIGHTS IN THE 
PAST, ZIRPOLO HAS 
DONE ALL THIS AT 
EIGHTEEN THOUSAND 
FEET, AT 115 MILES 
PER HOUR, AND AT
