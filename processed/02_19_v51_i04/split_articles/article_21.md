ost flying machines are undeniably 
cool. Jets, sleek and swift, play chicken 
with the ends of runways to earn their 
ascent. Helicopters, brash and insectile, thump the 
earth from their skids with blades that whir with 
lethal intent. 

But humanity’s earliest aircraft is different. The 
hot air balloon has never been much more than a 
flammable fabric sack, connected to an equally 
flammable wicker basket, powered by a giant 
flamethrower and stuffed with passengers whose 
quarter- to mid-life crises aren’t severe enough to 
justify skydiving. 

As instruments of travel, balloons leave a lot to 
be desired. They can’t even be steered—or, at least, 
they don’t come with flight sticks. Learning to fly a 
balloon begins, as all fun things do, with a physics 
lesson: hot air rises over cooler air. From their 
baskets, pilots manipulate the fire burning above 
their heads; igniting it elevates the balloon, while 
extinguishing it allows the craft to descend. As the 
balloon climbs and falls, it gets pushed around by 
wind patterns that split the sky like layers in a cake. 

Because open flames and gusts of wind are less-
than-exact control mechanisms, balloons don’t have 
dedicated runways or helipads. Any flat patch of dirt 
or asphalt has to suffice as a landing spot. 

That’s exactly how Robert Zirpolo, a veteran 
balloonist, likes it. He has flown tours over 
Connecticut 
for 
the 
past 
thirty-eight 
years, 
cultivating over that time a cloud-gray moustache 
that overwhelms his upper lip and short gray curls 
that poke out from the baseball cap covering his 
mostly-bald head. Zirpolo can fly single- and multi-
engine planes, too, but he prefers balloons. He 
remembers what a pilot friend told him years ago: 
“The best part about ballooning is, it makes no sense 
at all.”

Perched in his wicker basket, Zirpolo reaches up 
toward an oxidized metal burner and flicks open its 
blast valve. Liquid propane shoots from fuel tanks 
nestled near his knees, through thick black tubes 
wrapped around arched bamboo rods, and into the 
burner’s vaporizing coils. A jet of dragon’s breath 
erupts into the October air, burning blue, white, 
and orange-yellow as it smothers the surrounding 
area in soupy heat. 

Then Zirpolo shuts the valve, choking the flame. 
The 7 a.m. air reverts to a biting 38 degrees. His 
fiery engine, hotter than a thousand ovens, is ready; 
the rest of his balloon, scattered on the dewy grass of 
a private airfield in Bethlehem, Connecticut, is not. 

Using a ripcord-powered industrial fan, Zirpolo 
forces one hundred and five thousand cubic 
feet of air into the massive nylon balloon, which 
is patterned with gold, scarlet, and dark-green 
arrowheads arranged against a blue background. 
The open-bottomed bundle of fabric grows from 
the ground like a bulbous blister, its ribbed surface 
rippling in the breeze. Once taut, it looks like a 
hundred-foot lightbulb turned on its side. Having 
tethered the balloon to the bamboo rods, he leans 
his basket over, aims the attached burner into the 
balloon’s mouth, and blasts fire into it until the 
entire apparatus stands upright. 

Zirpolo has spent the past week studying weather 
reports, memorizing wind patterns, and staking 
out possible landing spots. He’s sent up a small 
test balloon that morning to see where the wind is 
actually blowing. And he’s watched less-experienced 
pilots—whom he calls “the real test balloons”—take 
off from an adjacent airstrip and disappear over the 
trees. He’s ready to launch. 

In the sky, he’ll keep track of a fuel gauge, 
an altimeter, a vertical speed indicator, and a 
pyrometer, which measures the temperature inside 
the balloon. He’ll relay his location to his ground 
crew, and adjust the open flame above his head so 
that his balloon doesn’t drift toward a major city 
or out over the Atlantic. “Nothing is automated 
whatsoever, so your brain is constantly engaged in 
what you’re doing,” he said. On different flights in 
the past, he’s done all this at eighteen thousand feet, 
at 115 miles per hour, and at 27 degrees below zero. 

Once, after he landed in a schoolyard in Ireland, a 
student walked out from the assembled crowd and 
whispered to Zirpolo, “Tell the teachers there’s no 
homework today.” The pilot proceeded to announce 
that, according to American custom, all homework 
was to be suspended upon the sighting of a hot 
air balloon. He hit the blast valve as the students 
cheered and the teachers’ smiles dropped. 

There are ways to have fun that don’t involve 
barreling through the air in a craft cobbled together 
from fabric and wicker and fire. And there are 
certainly more efficient forms of transportation. So 
why become an aeronaut? 

Part of the answer might be temperamental. 
Ballooning is a study in iconoclasm: its history is full 
of wanderers, thinkers, tinkerers, failures, loafers, 
coasters, charmers, schemers, pathbreakers, and one 
intrepid Frenchman who tried to inflate a balloon 
with combustible gas he had extracted from fecal
