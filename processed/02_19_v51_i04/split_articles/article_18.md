O
n the evening of June 26, Erika Lopez was 
curling up on the couch to watch TV after 
a day of work at the District Attorney’s office 
in Manhattan when her phone buzzed. The words that 
flashed across the screen made her stomach drop. Jheri 
Richards, Lopez’s off-campus housemate, had frantically 
texted her that a Yale student staying in New Haven over 
the summer had been walking past the Kappa Alpha 
Theta sorority house at 277 Crown Street, where Lopez 
and Richards live during the school year, when he noticed 
that the windows had been smashed in. Panicked, Lopez 
called 9-1-1. When police arrived on site later that night, 
they found that the windows had only been partially 
shattered. No one had broken in.
Relieved, Lopez contacted Pike International, the 
real-estate company Theta rents from, asking them to 
replace the broken windows. On July 5, Sol Lipschitz, 
one of Pike’s housing managers, sent an email promising 
to replace the windows. After three weeks of silence, 
Lipschitz emailed on August 1 saying he had ordered 
new windows. The repair didn’t take place until late 
August. The windows had remained broken for nearly 
two months.
This event only pierces the surface of Lopez’s 
discontent with Pike. Today, walking through the Crown 
Street house, you’ll encounter orange stains and holes 
in the ceiling, doors that don’t close properly, and a 
malfunctioning boiler. A year before the window incident, 
the lock on the front door broke while the house stood 
empty for the summer. When a Theta employee visited 
for a routine check-up on the house, he found several 
strangers squatting in the foyer.
According to Lopez, Pike has consistently failed to 
respond to these issues in a timely fashion. I interviewed 
six student tenants renting from Pike for this story. All six 
cited issues with the company, from unresponsive property 
managers to withheld security deposits, continuous leaks, 
and broken heaters. After two rounds of responses to 
general questions about long-term business goals and the 
number of units they own, Pike representatives did not 
respond to multiple inquiries about tenants’ complaints.
“Do not rent from Pike,” said Lopez. “That’s the moral 
of the story.”

A five-minute stroll through the periphery of Yale’s 
campus along Lynwood Place, Crown Street, and 
Edgewood Avenue reveals countless Pike logos, plastered 
on brick walls and hanging over doorways. Pike owns 
eight hundred units throughout the city and commands a 
small army of around fifty direct employees, one hundred 
indirect contractors, and around fifteen maintenance 
employees from the company’s compact office at 19 
Howe St. 
Pike was founded in 2000 by Shmully Hecht, who 
is also one of the founders of Shabtai, a Jewish secret 
society at Yale. After the 2008 recession, which increased 
the unemployment rate in New Haven by around 40 
percent by 2010 and left 1,800 properties vacant, Hecht 
and his employees went on a property-buying spree, 
purchasing foreclosed buildings, refurbishing them, and 
leasing them to Yale students and New Haven residents. 
In a 2011 article in the New Haven Independent, editor 
Paul Bass wrote, “Pike is increasingly determining where 
New Haven sleeps, eats, and works.”
According to Lipschitz, the Pike property manager, 
the company rents to “many hundreds of Yale students, 
faculty, and employees,” and has custom designed and 
built fifteen “luxury houses” for members of the Yale 
community. Lipschitz emphasized Pike’s dedication 
to historical preservation and customer service. Their 
mission, he wrote in an email, involves “providing a local 
charm, respect for historic architecture, and the best 
customer service in New Haven.”
In 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency 
charged Pike for violation of lead-safety rules. In fourteen 
different rental units, Pike failed to disclose information 
about the presence of lead-based paint, which contains 
a neurotoxin that stunts children’s mental development.
