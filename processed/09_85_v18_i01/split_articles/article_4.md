**Giamatti for Senate?**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
tioned as possible candidates, only 
Giamatti has received any kind of en-
dorsement from 
Weicker and 
D'Amore, both of whom feel that the 
president would make a strong and ex-
citing Republican candidate. 

Anne Scheer, media relations direc-
tor for D'Amore, described Giamatti as 
having all the attributes of a fine politi-
cian. "He is articulate, has a good 
sense of humor, and is a knowl-
edgeable and· proven administrator," 
said Scheer, who referred to Woodrow 
Wilson, 
a 
former 
president of 
Princeton, as a perfect example of 
educator turned politician. 

If Giamatti, a registered Indepen-
dent, were to make a bid for the 
Senate, it remains unclear whether he 
would run as a Republican or Demo-
crat. Senator Dodd's office meanwhile 
refuses to make an official comment 
until Giamatti reaches a decision. In 
order to campaign effectively. Yale's 
outgoing president will have to make a 
statement soon. 

Giamatti, who had not considered 
politics before Weicker and D'Amore's 
offer, has made no commitments and 
is keeping all options open. "I don't feel 
under pressure of any kind to make a 
decision," Giamatti said two weeks ago 
from his summer home on Martha's 
Vineyard. "I had conversations with 
some people and I told them I would 
think about it. It's nothing more than 
that."

**Elite but not Exempt?**
**Author: Melissa Tumulty**

While the members of Yale's Elihu 
~lub spent the last several weeks vaca-
tioning, its lawyers were preparinl{ for 
a coun confrontation. Come October, 
the club's attornevs will find them-
selves facing Ia" .. :vers of the ::-.:ew 
Haven tax assesso~'s office before an 
~rbiter, a retired Connecticut state 
JUstice. Elihu, one of Yale's coed senior 
SOcieties, filed suit last March a~ainst 
the assessor's office 
after the cit)' 
d 
. 
• 
ented the organization's appeal for 
property tax exemption on 
its 
S200,000 house at 175 Elm Street. The 
-
'ii Assessor Steven Juda, on the other 
~ hand, asserted, "The property is not 
~ exclusively used for educational pur-
t poses, and we believe it functions 
~ also as a social entity much like a 
-g fraternal society, such as the Moose or 
"i Elk Clubs." 

Elihu's Elm St. clubhouse-object of a 
"one-on-one" dispute with the assessor 
case is of substantial interest to not on-
ly Elihu, but to Book and Snake and 
St. Anthony's, two clubs that may soon 
have to pay taxes as well. 

Under Connecticut law, an organiz-
ation qualifies for exemption if it can 
prove that its premises are used ex-
clusively for educational purposes. 

Book and Snake and St. Anthony's 
may find their current tax exempt 
status revoked depending on the out-
come of the Elihu case. Not surprising-
ly, the conflict boils down to the ques-
tion: is Elihu a social or an academic 
institution? 

Up to now, Elihu has been a modd 
citizen, paying its $15,000 in property 
tax annually. Its sudden appeal for ex-
emption could be linked to ;-.;e .... 
Haven's rising property tax rates At 
anv rate, Elihu backs up its clatms with 
its 'certificate of Incorporation. which 
describes the club as seeking to .. pro-
mote literary and scientific education" 
through discussions, 
lectures and 
papers. There is no mention, however, 
of social activities. New Haven Tax 
~ 

While refusing to divulge specific 
:1 examples of social happenings at the 
house, .Juda does admit that "no one in 
this offke really knows for sure what 
goes on in there." But he promises to 
remedy the situation by requesting an 
inspection of the premises by the 
judge, attorneys, defendant and plain-
tiff. This plan does not seem to bother 
Elihu President Richard Urausky, '67, 
who claims that Elihu is not and never 
was a secret society. 

Even if the club's lawyers convinc-
ingly argue that the property is used 
solely for educational purposes, Juda 
plans to take another tack by question-
ing Elihu's alle~ed elitist policies. "Ac-
cess to Elihu is not made available to 
the 
avera~e Yale student-only to 
those select 15 juniors chosen by the 
out'{Oing senior members," Juda said. 

Although the case can be seen as a 
hmt to the University about its own tax 
exempt position, Juda denies that it is 
another sign of deteriorating town-
gown relations. He prefers to call it, 
rather, a "one-on-one dispute between 
Elihu and the tax assessor." Should the 
court rule in favor of New Haven, 
Elihu will continue to pay its property 
tax. Mort'over, Juda will apply the 
decision as an umbrella ruling and 
revoke the tax exempt status of Book 
and Snake and St. Anthony's. Alter-
natclv, tf the decision goes to Elihu, the 
tax assessor's office may receive several 
more applications for exemption by 
other Yale societies. which like the 
th{'ee m quec;uon, know a good deal 
when they see it.
