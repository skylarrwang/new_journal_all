YBC," one community member said, 
"they see it as a community station." 

"When the community had more input, it was a better station," another said. A third added, "It hasn't been working with just students in control." 

David Schwartz, who airs WYBC's Heritage folk music program, explained that back in the 1960s and 1970s, when WYBC was a major force in 
radio, 
Yale 
and community 
members ran the operational side 
together. "But in the last two years there has been a growing paranoia on 
Yale's part," he explained. "Now decisions are made behind locked doors 
and it's 
none of the community 
members' business. It's necessary to 
work together, but the pressure from 
Yale has been polarizing the station." 

Etkind spoke angrily of the summer 
months, saying, "Our elected officers 
aren't here representing us, and we're 
left to care for the station." 

"A lot of the community people are 
down on Yalies," Moser explained. 
"They complain that Yalies can't run 
the station, because they don't know 
what they're doing. But you can learn a 
hell of a lot in four years." Yet Moser 
sees truth in what the community 
members say. "I've been around the 
station for a long time," he said. "This 
summer I took a cold look at it. We're 
not an undergraduate organization. 
The community members care more 
about the station and put more effort 
into it, while Yale students are by 
nature a transitory group." 

The division shows at meetings of 
the General Board, where all station 
members are 
present: 
community 
members sit on one side of the room, 
Yale students on the other. Only a few 
break the strict separation. WYBC's 
call letters stand for the Yale Broadcasting Company; members of predominantly community-staffed formats refer to the station as "Your Best 
Choice." 

Community involvement in WYBC 
dates back to the 1961, when WYBC 
added a new purpose to its by-laws: 
To serve as a communications link 
between the Yale community and surrounding area, bringing the resources 
of the university to its neighbors, and

There were glossed sticky
