Operating in conservative times and 
led by such outspoken men as jerry 
Falwell, religious fundamentalism in 
America seems to have grown healthy 
and powerful. The auention of media 
and politicians alike proves that fun-
damentalism is now a force to be 
reckoned with. Yet every year in-
dividuals once deeply involved with 
fundamentalism 
quietly leave the 
movement and enter a society radically 
different from that of their churches. 


Few if any groups addressed the special 
emotional needs of ex-fundamentalists 
until last April, when Yale Divinity 
School graduate Richard Yao, '80, 
himself an ex-member, created Fun-
damentalists Anonymous (FA). The 
organization's rapid expansion from its 
first chapter in New York City shows a 
need for FA in every sector of the na-
tion, including, Yao believes, the col-
lege campus. To kick-off a cross coun-
try sweep of colleges, Yao and other 
representatives of FA will be in New 
Haven from September 16 to 18. 


Through talks open to the entire com-
munity, FA members hope to reveal 
the problems of ex-fundamentalists 
and the necessity of a support system 
for them at Yale. 


Because 
fundamentalist 
churches 
tend to be extremely exclusive com-
munities, explained Grace Mellon, FA 
volunteer and ex-fundamentalist, 
those who leave encounter difficulties 
acclimating themselves to life outside. 


According to 
Yao, 
churches command considerable social 
respectability, 
and 
rejecting the 
lifestyle often leaves people feeling they 
have failed or are inadequate. The focus 
of the organization is 
to provide 
support 
for 
these 
people 
through 
hot 
lines, 
newsletters and 
rap 
sessions with other ex-fundamentalists. 


Mellon, who spent 18 months in 
therapy after rejecting fundamen-
talism, notes that psychiatric help 
alone is often insufficient. "Fundamen-
talism teaches that you're in the world 
but not part of the world," she said. 
"Unless people have been involved in 
this thing, they don't realize what it is 
for someone to get out of it." 


Currently, there are approximately 
six million ex-fundamentalists in the 
country. 


Twenty-two 
FA chapters 
already have opened across the nation, 
with 
130 
more 
soon 
to follow. 
Spokespeople for the organization have 
been interviewed on numerous televi-
sion programs, such as Donahue and 
Today and in national magazines. The 
wide media coverage has enabled FA 
to reach its ever-growing audience, a 
fact that disturbs some fundamen-
talists. 


Despite this distrust, the organiza-
tion has no desire to lure people away 
from their churches. "We're not trying 
to recruit 
happy fundamentalists," 
Mellon said. Yet FA does try to make 
individuals aware that, as Yao puts it, 
"some people get very badly burned" 
by fundamentalism. "By telling our 
stories, fundamentalists see us as a 
threat," he said, "but we don't want to 
be an 'anti-group.' We JUSt want to say, 
'Hey, there is life after this thing."'

The name A. Barlett Giamatti seems 
to be on just about everybody's lips 
these days, and with good reason. 
From buzzing press conferences in 
New H<lven to Washington cocktail 
parties, the future of Yale's president is 
a favorite topic of conversation, for he 
is 
presently 
considering a 
career 
change which may very well lead to na-
tional politics. According to articles 
published recently in Thr Nrw York 
Times and The Washington Post, two of 
Connecticut's most prominent Repub-
licans want Giamatti to run for Senate 
in 1986. 


Giamatti, 
who announced last 
spring his resignation as president in 
June 1986, has met extensively with 
Connecticut Senator Lowell P.'Neicker 
(R) 
state 
Republican Chair-
man Thomas J. D'Amore. fhey hope 
to 
persuade 
him 
to challenge 
Democratic incumbent Christopher J. 
Dodd in the upcoming Senate race.
