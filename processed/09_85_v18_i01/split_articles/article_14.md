group and it never has been. For the 
disease to make its methodical way out 
of minority risk groups and into the 
general poP,ulation was simply a func-
tion of time. Now the virus is in an in-
termediate stage where the number of 
risk groups has grown but the majority 
of Americans are still not threatened. 
The new potential victims? They are 
prostitutes, patrons of prostitutes, 
wives or lovers of bisexual men, and 
perhaps most 
tragically, 
young 
children and infants. It is too late to 
help many of these new victims, but for 
Dr. George Miller, saving the lives of 
children is how the battle against AIDS 
may be won or lost for the next genera-
tion. 

A pediatrician, Miller has a five-year 
grant from the federal government to 
study how AIDS is passed from an in-
fected mother to her child and what can 
be done to halt the process. As more 
and more women are exposed to the 
HTLV-111 virus, that problem will 
become an increasingly significant and 
emotional element of the AIDS crisis. 
"We went backwards," explained 
Miller, who speaks in so few words that 
ht' seems almost self-conscious about 
his work. "Instead of starting with the 
mothers, we found the infants first, and 
then looked to find the mothers." 

Next to Miller sat Kelsey Martin, 
Miller's research assistant. A Harvard 
graduate about to enter Yale 
Medical School, Martin explained that 
although the babies were referred to 
them through the hospital, finding the 
mothers was more difficult than they 
had 
expected. 
For many of the 
children, there were no mothers to be 
found; most of the women were poor, 
and several were prostitutes. All had 
given up their children. "To find the 
mothers," Martin said, "I went through 
any contact I could find, whether it was 
a physician, a drug detox worker, a 
social worker, a policeman, any type of 
contact." One of the mothers, a pros-
titute, had died, probably from AIDS. 

Since 1984, Miller and Martin have 
located 12 children who appeared to be 
infected; three of them have since died. 
The researchers' first step was to deter-
mine if the children did indeed have the
disease. To do that they had to create a 
new blood test, one more accurate and 
specific than that used by blood banks. 
It took them about a year, but even-
tually the pair created a test which 
would identify specific proteins within 
the HTLV-III virus. Though their test 
is too complex to be used on a large 
scale, it did prove that the infants had 
HTLV-111 in their blood. The next 
question became: Where did they get 
it? The two then tested the mothers 
they had located, finding what they had 
expected. The women also tested posi-
tive for the AIDS antigen. 

Miller's findings show that a woman 
who has been exposed to HTLV-III 
has a disturbingly high chance of giv-
ing birth to a baby with AIDS. He ex-
plained, "We think that this virus per-
sists in a carrier, that individuals can 
be infected for very long periods of 
time and that they can transmit the in-
fection for a very long time. The 
chances are that once a woman is in-
fected, she will be capable of transmit-
ting it to her infant indefinitely." 

But Miller doesn't know how the in-
fants actually get their exposure to the 
virus. It could be from the shared 
blood within the mother's womb, or 
during the post-natal stage through the 
mother's milk, or even as the baby 
passes down the birth . canal during 
labor. Miller does believe that "the in-
fants are especially susceptible to the 
virus, and a very high percentage of 
those who are exposed will come down 
with the full-blown syndrome, prob-
ably somewhere between 20 and 50 
percent." Though it hasn't happened 
yet, Miller may soon find himself

While he stresses that he has no power
