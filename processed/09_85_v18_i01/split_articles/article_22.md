Beyond Equality 
In the spring of 1985, the Board of Trustees of Albertus 
Magnus College (AMC) announced that the number of men 
in the class of 1989 would be greater than in any previous 
class. On most campuses, such an announcement would 
merit no more than obligatory remarks from the student 
body. Albertus students, however, had a special reason for 
responding passionately: the class of 1989 will be the first 
class at AMC to have any men at all. Understandably, this 
type of institutional change could not pass unnoticed. 
Whether people agreed or disagreed with the decision, 
everyone wanted the answer to one question- why? 

Albertus Magnus College was founded in 1926 by the 
Sisters of St. Mary of the Springs based in Columbus, Ohio. 
Like many women's colleges, AMC was created simply to 
provide women access to higher education. Women's 
colleges shook the barriers of sexism and educated young 
women in an environment where they were "protected" from 
the dangers of the world outside the home. As these colleges 
became more established, their simple mission evolved into 
something stronger, more central to the lives of women: to 
help women cultivate in themselves a sense of self-
acceptance, confidence and esteem. Given a world of sexism 
and prejudice, this proved a task of great importance to the 
status of women. 

As the nation has become more progressive, single-sex 
institutions, both male and female, have found themselves 
vulnerable to the pressures of a society seeking equality 
between the genders. Coeducational colleges provide men 
and women with the chance to share thoughts and feelings, 
to interact socially in an educational setting that is still 
somewhat "protective." As confidence has grown in 
coeducation, single-sex institutions have come to be viewed 
as antiquated and out of touch with reality. Ideally, one 
hopes that the number of women's colleges has decreased 
because today men and women may be educated in a 
"sexless" environment, an environment where people learn 
as human beings, beyond the long-imposed restrictions of 
gender. It is naive to believe that such a society presently 
exists. 

I chose a women's college because I felt that I would find 
there opportunities for leadership and self-expression. At a 
women's college these opportunities are readily accessible to 
those who take advantage of them. As a young woman who 
often retreated from positions of leadership and chances to 
voice an opinion, I felt that Albertus would allow me to face 
some of my own insecurities. In a single-sex classroom I 
learned that I could trust my own mind; I developed the 
confidence to share ffi)' thoughts and insights. Gradually I 
found myself involved in projects which made me confident 
that I could handle leadership. What Albertus gave me was a 
four-year opportunity to begin growing up-confidently, 
proudly. 

While many people might assert that a women's college 
provides a false sense of security, I believe that it gives young 
women the freedom to forget that some people think less of 
them simply because they are women. In such a setting it 
becomes easier to develop one's potential as a person fortun-
ate enough to be female. Now, instead of feeling that I have 
to prove myself as a woman, I feel a responsibility to prove 
myself as a human being. 

When I learned that AMC was going to admit men, my 
initial reaction was a sense of loss. I began to wonder 
whether the education I had come to value so highly had 
been worth anything at all. In one swoop I had been told that 
Albertus could offer more to its students as a coed college 
than it could offer as a women's college. I had been foolish to 
believe that a women's college could help me to develop in 
ways that a coed college could not. I felt that my accomplish-
ments at Albertus had been a farce, earned in an 
environment which was, I was now told, without credibility. 

As president of the Albertus Magnus student government 
association this past year, I was forced beyond my private 
reactions. Like any savvy business management, the 
Albertus administration realized that the college-bound 
market is simply not interested in higher education divided 
by sex. The challenge for the college is to make this move be 
more than simply a prudent financial decision. Albertus has 
to embrace a new mission, and that is education of mutu-
ality. Albertus h~s to move beyond equality between the 
sexes 
to 
provide an 
educational atmosphere 
which 
acknowledges differences between the sexes and encourages 
people to develop these differences to a personal best. 

Last spring, I had very little time to weigh my own 
feelings as I came to realize that this change was inevitable 
and had to be accepted. To fight it would violate the 
education I valued so much. I still believe that women's 
colleges have an important place in the educational system of 
our country, but realities must be faced. Coeducation will 
allow Albertus Magnus College to grow, and for that reason 
I had to support the change. It is a difficult move to accept, 
however; coeducation is a risk which threatens the heritage 
of AMC students and alumnae. But there is a positive out-
come in taking this risk. Ultimately, any college education of 
real value will teach students to learn from themselves. 

When Albertus Magnus is able to cultivate this ability in its 
students, both men and women, it will truly have succeeded 
in 
replacing single-sex 
education with education of 
mutuality.
