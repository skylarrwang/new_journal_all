Only the very sick are allowed into the Dana-3 clinic at 
Yale-New Haven Hospital, but somehow this woman had 
managed to get in, and she certainly did not look sick. 
Young and pretty, wearing a colorful striped skirt and a 
flattering blouse, she approached Dr. Askenase and 
handed him her business card. "Doctor," she said, "you 
have to tell me if John Derek is a patient here." 
"I'm sorry," he said, "but you know I can't tell you 
that." 
"But you have to," she replied, somewhat testily. "This 
guy was seeing me for a while, and now he's seeing some-
one else. And I just think someone ought to give hitn a 
call or something that's all." 
"I'm afraid that's none of my business," Doctor 
Askenase said. He walked away. I followed behind him. 
"That's a difficult situation," I said. 
The doctor looked at me dryly. "That young woman," 
he said, "is a prostitute. She's worried. She spends a lot of 
time here at the AIDS clinic."
