Behind the Facemask 
"Nobody is here just 
to play football. 
We're here because 
this is Yale. W e're all 
scholars first, and we 
play football because 
we like it." 
Clad in a shiny ~' hite helmet and ~rey 
sweats still damp 
from 
morning 
calisthenics on the dewy playing field, 
Steve Skwara runs down the sidelines 
surrounded by his fellow linemen. 
Thirty yards down the field Skwara, 
PC '86, and the others end their sprint 
and jog to the sideline, only to begin 
another drill. They do a frantic shuffie, 
keeping themselves low to the ground 
and criss-crossing their legs, until they 
have sidestepped back to their original 
starting point. "Come on!" the offen-
sive line coach yelled from the side-
lines. "Keep those butts down! You 
guys oughta look like the Rockeues!" 
The players continue their awkward 
dance down the field one after the 
other, like a twtsted ~arne of folio.,.. the 
leader. Skwara finishes and stands up 
straight, gazing across the field at the 
other players while waiting to run the 
drill once agam. Perhaps he sees Kelly

around him. He pauses, waiting for 
Coach Carm Cozza to call the play. 
"forty-two ... 39 ... hike!" the coach 
screamed. Rvan drop<; back and raises 
his arm to th.row. but suddenly swmgs 
around. handmg the ball off to an im-
aginary running back Tucking the 
ball under his arm. Rvan meanders 
back to the ltne of scrimmage to do it 
all over again Across the field the 
defense runs backwards, and at the 
50-yard line, receivers run their pat-
terns over and over. 
Three weeks ago the practice field 
was empty, no watchtowers and no 
baseball-capped coaches. 
Now 
the 
sounds of football reverberate through 
the air: the crack of shoulder pad 
against hip pad, the panting of men 
sprinting from end zone to end zone. 
As happens every year, the Yale foot-
ball team has returned for its pre-
season training camp. With hopes of 
producing 
a 
winning squad, 
coaches have brought together 120 
young men, hundreds of plays and for-
mations, and several tons of equip-
ment for ten days. The practice 9ay 
begins at six-thirty a.m. and ends at 
10:30 p.m., two field sessions, team 
meals, practice films and talks with 
coaches falling in between.

however, 
something changes. The desire to push 
through the last set of sprints or to 
perfect coverage on the receiver means 
very little to other students sitting in a 
history lecture. This isn't the team any 
more. The athlete's height and bulk 
separate him from other Yalies. One 
look places him in the category "foot-
ball player," the dumb jock- hard-

drinking, clannish, violent. Yale does 
not cushion a player's life with athletic 
scholarships or bonuses; most pro-
fessors do not give passing grades to 
men simply because of their sport. 
Unlike those in the Pac-10, the majori-
ty of football players here realize they 
will never play in the pros, or even 
gain recognition outside Yale. There 
are no obvious reasons for playing 
football at Yale. Even the players have 
their doubts sometimes. But they do 
have their reasons for playing, even if 
most students fail to understand them. 
Going into the pre-season training 
camp, the team was under the added 
pressure of being widely favored to win 
the Ivy League title this fall. According 
to Sports Illustrated, "Yale has returned 
to form and should be the best of the 
Ivies. The Elis won six of their last 
seven games behind a slew of sopho-
mores." Included in those six victories 
was an exciting, come-from-behind 
win over a strong Harvard team. 
P layers and coaches, however, remain . 
wary. They remember that the same 
prediction was made in 1983, the year 
Yale had a humiliating 1-9 record. 
For now, the team and coaches put 
the predictions and the memory of bad 
luck away, focusing instead on the 
three months ahead. The work for the 
upcoming season began almost as soon 
as the last one ended, players weight-

lifting and running through the oil-
season into the summer. Following a 
rigorous weight-training program 
devised by the coaches, players spent 
much of the summer in their old high 
school gyms, 
their garages, 
their 
basements. More thanÂ· most of his 
teammates, Yves Labissiere knows the 
importance of summer training. A 
highly touted defensive lineman, 
Labissiere, DC '87, dislocated his 
shoulder during last year's football 
camp. He missed most of the season, 
playing only in the last five games. 
This year, Labissiere arrived at camp 
showing no signs of last season's 
physical struggle. Sporting a tank-top 
that covered a massive upper torso, 
Labissiere stunned his teammates. For 
many players, Labissiere's comeback 
exemplifies the substantial difference 
summer lifting can make. Labissiere's 
progress stems partly from the pleasure 
he takes in summer training. "I really 
like seeing how much you can push 
yourself, how much can be dished out 
to you. It sounds sadistic, but it's en-
joyable," Labissiere said. 
Labissiere performed the workouts 
faithfully not only for . the personal 
satisfaction but because he trusts the 
advice of his coaches. A native of 
Haiti, Labissiere grew up in a strict 
household where he learned the bene-
fits of self-discipline. As a child, he 
played soccer, but when his family 
moved to this country Labissiere got 
his first introduction to football. Dur-
ing his freshman year at Holy Cross 
H igh School in Queens, New York, 
Labissiere was approached by the foot-
.ball coach. 
Although 
he 
initially 
thought football was "wild, crazy and 
stupid," he grew to enjoy the training, 
and it became an important part of his 
life. By his senior year, Labisierre had 
become captain of the team and an All-
League player, a great prospect for col-
leges with large football programs. 
Labissiere signed a letter of intent with 
Syracuse University, but his mother, 
who felt education was more important 
than football, convinced him to apply 
to schools with more stringent aca-
demic requirements. Having already 
signed with Syracuse, Labissiere had 
to consider schools in a lower athletic 
division, and narrowed his choices 
down to Holy Cross or Yale. He has no 
doubt that he made the best choice. 
Many players at Yale were in 
Labissiere's position, with impressive 
high school stats and the chance to 
enter major college football programs. 
Yet they chose Yale. Most wanted to 
continue playing the game, but real-
ized they would be cut from Division I 
teams. At smaller, Division I-A Yale, 
they could still play while receiving a 
better education than at the football 
powers. "Nobody is here just to play 
football," J ohn Duryea, Yale's top 
placekicker, said. "We're here because 
this is Yale. We're all scholars first, and 
we play football because we like it, 
that's all." Duryea, a mere 170 pounds, 
speaks modestly, although he holds 
Florida'!' longest .field goal record for a 
high school player. With that much 
talent, Duryea could have easily gone 
to a better football school than Yale. 
"You could always go to a football fac-
tory like Texas, but what good would it 
do you?" Duryea asked. 
If you've ever seen a. film of a fight be-
