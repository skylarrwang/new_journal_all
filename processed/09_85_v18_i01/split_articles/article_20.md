but with that all-consuming desire of 
each oarsman to be the best. The 
athletes row for the sake of rowing. 
They know that excellence in the sport 
does not lead to multi-million dollar, 
TV-cut contracts with professional franchises, nor well-paid endorsements of 
cereals and sportswear. Indeed, their 
rowing fame will probably never reach 
beyond their hometowns. Nonetheless, 
these men are driven to suffer, to 
sacrifice, to work and push themselves 
beyond their limits. 

Such drive surely exists outside of 
rowing. Yet Halberstam sees that rowing 
and amateurism are tightly bound 
together, and their bond is especially 
pronounced because of the anonymity 
of crew, its great distance from television cameras and the viewing public. 
The total devotion of each man to the 
sport fascinates 
the author, and 
Halberstam 
often 
writes 
as 
if 
mesmerized by both the mechanics of 
rowing as well as the beauty of 
amateur athletics. 
A good crew meant shoehorning some 
eighteen hundred pounds of meat and 
ambition and ego into a thin shell that 
weighed about 180 pounds and then 
making it work. But in the case of a 
great crew, there was something more 
glorious . . . Here were eight oarsmen, 
having worked so hard and sacrificed so 
much, catching something magical and 
doing it race after race, each oarsman 
making the others better. The feeling 
made them not just confident but also 
Because of their single goal and 
unadulterated love of rowing, the four 
athletes often come across as strikingly 
selfish people, blind to the needs and 
cares of others. The selfishness leads 
each rower away from the team boats—
eights, fours, pairs—and into single 
scull competition. Collegiate rowing, 
however, emphasizes competition in 
eights, and oarsmen must cooperate in 
order to succeed. A certain understanding prevails in rowing a good team 
boat, but Halberstam's competitors 
often disregard this code. In races and 
practices, no one speaks but the cox-
swain. Yet during one race, Tiff Wood 
screams, "Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!" 
Halberstam does not realize that he 
has given an example of deplorable 
teamwork. He notices only the exceptional drive and determination of 
Wood. Bigelow and the other have the 
same problem—
each trusting just himself 
in a sport that relies upon the mutual 
trust among all nine members of a 
boat. 

Along with this lack of team con-
sciousness, the four oarsmen demonstrate an inability to deal with other in-
dividuals. The rowers in the book are 
outcasts, each a shy man who uses 
rowing to bring him confidence. Excellence in crew does give them 
strength, but it takes the shape of disdain and lack of respect for others. The 
characters themselves often make for 
unpleasant reading. But a crucial part 
of the book's message is that this 
selfishness is integral to the insane 
drive of the pure amateur. Each of the 
oarsmen is consumed 
by his own 
yearning to succeed in the sport. Yet 
success can be measured only by the 
competitor himself, not by the cheers of 
crowds or by a friend's congratulations. Perhaps the self-imposed isola-
tion, 
the unrelenting 
self-criticism 
somehow absolves the oarsman. Then 
again, perhaps not. 

This ambiguity lends *The Amateurs* 
much of its drama. And based on my 
three years of experience with Yale 
crew, I know this predicament is very 
real to people at all levels of collegiate 
rowing. Rowers at Yale share an affliction with Halberstam's oarsmen, driving themselves through painful workouts, then often facing the same social 
crises. 

Although rowing frequently begins 
as a vague, non-committal interest, it 
becomes all-consuming, as the rower 
grows infatuated with everything crew-
related, talks incessantly about the 
sport, and in winter, spends three 
hours a day in torture at the gym. 
People try to quit sometimes, for 
whatever reason, but most can't; they 
always come back. Anyone who has 
seen such mania has seen a true 
amateur, a person who loves a sport as 
sport, who burns to succeed just to succeed. 

has isolated 
this 
wonderful 
amateur's virus and 
translated it onto paper. He has overcome the double-edged challenge of 
crew's lingo, generally avoiding both 
confusion and boredom for rowers and 
non-rowers alike. Better still, he has 
used crew to aid him in praising a purity of spirit and the drive that accompanies it. The author proves that in its 
highest form, such a quality can only 
be seen in amateur athletes. In the 
final chapter of the book, Halberstam 
describes the amateur's hard-won inner satisfaction as experienced by an 
oarsman soon after the Olympics:

Lewi~ 
(gold medalist in double 
scull) enjoyed immensely the grand 
tour 
of the United States with the 
other 
American Olympic medalists, 
even though being a gold medalist in a 
sport as eccentric as rowing did not increase his fame very much. The other 
rowers knew that he had won a gold, 
and some local papers paid attention. 
Other than that, the feeling of pleasure 
came entirely from within. What was it, 
he asked a friend, that Andy Warhol 
had said about fame in America? That it 
lasted for fifteen minutes? That was 
probably right.
