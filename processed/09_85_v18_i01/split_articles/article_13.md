way doctors have never before en· 
countered. Caused by a virus known as 
HTLV-III, AIDS attacks the immune 
system, leaving the victim open to 
weakening, 
frequently gruesome 
secondary illnesses. The most common 
of these are Kaposi's sarcoma, a type of 
cancer usually limited to elderly men 
of Mediterranean origin, and Pneumo· 
cystis carinii, a form of pneumonia. 


How the HTLV-III virus spreads, how 
it breaks down the body's defenses and 
how to fight the virus are mysteries 
which have frustrated the efforts of 
scientists both here and in Europe. 
AIDS, said one doctor, is a disease "some-
one envisioned in his wildest nightmares.~ 


Rankin pointed out that the soaring 
number of AIDS cases will impose a 
financial burden on all Americans, 
regardless of whether or not they ha,·e 
the disease. Though estimates ,·ary 
widely, one projection puts the medical 
cost of treating a single AIDS patient 
from the time of diagnosis until death 
at about $145,000. Add inflation, 
multiply by the potential million cases 
among the gay populace alone, and

you'll understand why Rankin is wor· 
ried. 


Yet so little is certain about AIDS 
that estimating how many the disease 
will strike is a near-impossible task. 
The problem lies with the deceptive 
nature of the AIDS virus, which can be 
present in the body for as long as two 
years before symptoms show. 
Ex-
plained Rankin. "People's reactions to 
any virus vary, for ~enetic reasons or 
whatever. Say there's a flu 
~oing 
around in winter. Some people wtll be 
put out for a week b" this ,·iru.., and be 
practically dead. People like vou and 
me, we'll get mavbe a sniffle. That's 
what happens with AIDS." 


On the sheet of paper in front of 
him, Rankin drew a series of circles. 
each inside the other. "There are going 
to be a lot of people up here. in the 
largest circle. '' ho have been expoc;cd 
to the virus and ha\'e de' eloped an-
tibodies. And there will be some peo· 
pie, a smaller group, who ha,·e been 
exposed to the virus and show some 
minor abnormalities in their tmmune 
system. Next there will be an e,·cn 
smaller group 
that will become 
somewhat sicker. They'll have what's 
caJlcd AIDS-related complex. And 
finally, 
there's the smallest group 
which will come down with that full· 
blown syndrome. These people are the 
only ones who are clinically defined as 
having AIDS." 


Since there is no way of predicting 
how many members of the outer 
groups will descend into the final cir· 
cle, R ankin feels it would be foolish for 
anvone in a risk group to rely on vague 
rumors of a cure or vaccine. Instead, 
the only realistic way of "stopping 
AJDS in its tracks" is to educate people 
about the disease, to convince them 
that to stav alive they will have to have 
to change their lifestyles. The burden 
of change will fall most ·heavily on gay 
men. ".:\l ost heterosexuals really have 
no need to worry right now," Rankin 
said. "I don't think we're at the point 
where a heterosexual man or woman 
has to ask their partner to filJ out a 
questionnaire before they have sex. 
But among the homosexual communi· 
ty, there is only one piece of advice

doctor, · is a disease 
"someone envisioned

nightmares." 


that is really going to make a dif-
ference: everyone who is gay should not 
be involved in · the transmission of 
bodily fluids." . Such advice would 
mean a drastically altered sex life for 
gay men, who would have to avoid any 
exchange of saliva while kissing and be 
forced to wear condoms during both 
anal and oral sex. 


Rankin continued, "We certainly tell 
men that affection between couples is 
possible: hugging and kissing and 
mutual masturbation are encouraged 
so that emotional gratification can be 
attained. 
There's no question that 
would involve a tremendous change in 
lifestyle for a lot of people. Still, that 
has to be the way to stop this, because 
once someone comes down with AIDS 
there's nothing we can do." Rankin 
drew a large zero on the paper. 
"Tragically, you have to write those 
people off." 


I met Laurie Help-fin at Yale-New 
Haven about a half hour before she 
was to take a blood test that she hoped 
would tell her, after a year and a half of 
uncertainty, whether she had AIDS. 
In her late twenties, with freckles and 
short brown hair, Helprin appeared 
healthy. Nonetheless, she had no sure 
explanation for the illness that has 
plagued the last 18 months of her life. 


When did you first start feeling sick? 
About a year and a half ago, I got 
really, really sick. I lost about 30 
pounds-vomiting, 
diarrhea, 
everything. I was running high fevers 
every night and was in a lot of pain. I 
Went to a hospital, and they tried to do 
an appendectomy on me. Well, that 
Wasn't the problem. 


When did you first think you might have 
AIDS? 
See, I was an intravenous drug user 
before. I never thought I had it, they 
just told me that. I think I got labeled 
because I was a drug user, I had 
hepatitis-B, I had an immunity prob-
lem. 
And 
when 
my 
tests came 
in everything wa~ pointing that way. 
But now . . . I'm too healthy to have 
AIDS. That's what I feel. 


How did someone from a small town in rural 
Connecticut get involved in using intravenous 
drugs? 
It's easy, they're all over the place. 
I'm not too far from a town called Nor-
wich, and there's a lot of drugs on the 
street there. Misery loves company, 
you know, 'cause that's what happened. 
This girl was doing it, and I just ended 
up doing it with her. And at first I 
wanted no part of it. It made me sick 
when I saw her getting off. But that's 
where I got the hepatitis from. 


Had you heard anything about AIDS then? 
No. Nothing at all. Feels like an 
awful long time ago, now. Feels like a 
million years. 


So you became addicted to heroin? How often 
did you have to shoot? 
God, as many times a day as I could. 
Minimum once a day if the money was 
tight. We were going to New York to 
buy because it was cheaper there, and 
it's just too much when you got two 
people doing it. Me and my husband. 


And when you were in the city for drugs you 
weren't concerned about what needles you 
used? 
Nope, There was a big box of them 
and 
you 
needed 
a 
works 
somebody just gave you one. Even if 
they were clean, the places weren't: one 
room and maybe 30 people. 


How do you feelTtow about that time of your 
life? 
I resent it a lot. I can't believe some 
of the things I did. I've changed. I'm on 
the verge of snapping most of the time, 
because I let it get to me. I sleep a lot 
but it doesn't do me any good because 
I'm . always tired. I'm edgy. I yell 
around the house a lot. I never yelled or 
anything like that in my life before. 


How has your life changed? 
Everything. My home life; you gotta 
look out for the children. I don't taste 
the food when I'm making dinner 
anymore. My parents, my friends treat 
me different. They could see I was ill. 
My husband, he's really scared. I 
mean, he hasn't shown any symptoms 
or anything, but it's like a time bomb 
waiting to go off. My son, he's 14, he's 
protective, he's bright, "Don't do this, 
don't go near that, you're gonna get 
sick." But my husband ... it's funny. I 
can't explain it. He hovers. 


Have you had arry problems getting medical 
care? 
· 
I can't get a doctor where I live to 
treat me. I had one, but he transferred 
to W-----, and I can't go there. His 
associates won't take me. They said 
they had full case loads- after looking 
at 1ny records, I'm sure. 


I got refused by three or four doctors 
about two weeks ago. I was really sick, 
and I couldn't get anyone to help ine. 
Each one came up with a different ex-
cuse. I got in to see one, and he almost 
fell out of his chair when I told him 
what was happening. He said, "I can't 
handle this, I'm too old, I'm about to 
retire." That's just what he said to me. 


How do you feel now? 
I feel a lot better now. Everything's 
kind of up in the air. I just got some 
really good news from my regular 
blood tests: they're normal, so I might 
not have AIDS. That's great. They're 
not really sure what's going on now, 
because I'm getting better whatever 
was wrong with me I'm getting better.
