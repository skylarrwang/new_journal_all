. 
When I.got to Vienna, I took pictures. 
Not 
pictures of museums and 
monuments- I 
had 
been 
taking 
museum and monument pictures in 
Leningrad all summer. No, I took pic-
tures of supermarkets, 
especially 
supermarkets with 
large 
cheese 
displays. There were so many different 
kinds it was confusing: blue, cheddar, 
Edam, Swiss. Even goat. Soft drink 
machines were another new photo op-
portunity. I found it extraordinary that 
cans of sweet fizzy liquid could come 
out of a machine. And in all different 
flavors! 

After several days, I reaccustomt'd 
myself to billboards, neon signs and 
store windows arranged to encourage 
purchases. Carefully lettered price tags 
ceased to phase me, and I forgot about 
the ubiquitous blue stamp that had 
marked prices in So,·iet stores. 

l 
remembered that I had actually grown 
up without state cheese and state 
mineral water, that I had tasted all of 
those exotic cheeses and soft drinks 
before. Although my original shock 
upon re-encountering the material 
wealth of the West soon faded, it took 
longer for Western behavior to make 
sense again. One Austrian girl whom I 
watched in a Viennese cafe struck me 
as particularly remarkable during my 
first week away from Leningrad. She 
had blonde bobbed hair, wore bright 
pink 
lipstick 
and 
a 
short 
white 
miniskirt which matched her shiny 
white teeth. She was drinking brandy 
and delicately bending her pinkie 
finger when she picked up the glass. I 
just sat there and thought about what 
an extraordinary creature she was, all 
blonde and pink and white and loud. 
about how amazing it was that she ap-
parently sa''' nothing wrong with wa,·-
ing her arms around when she talked 
in a public cafe, crossing and uncross-
ing her legs and laughing a lot. She 
probably knew how to plav teJ.Hl• 
I wanted to go up and ask hl'l. "1.,-
cuse me, how did you get to be su dif-
ferent from my friend Anya in Len-
ingrad " Anya doesn't know how to 
play tennis. She has bad teeth, because 
there are no Soviet orthodontists. I 
don't think she owns anything white, 
and I'm sure she doesn't own anything 
pink. She has never tasted brandy. 
When she leaves her apartment, she 
lowers her eyes while speaking, and 
her face seems to close inward, like all 
the other faces of Soviet citizens on the 
streets. 

Of course the Viennese girl would 
have laughed at me. I resembled her 
more than I resemble Anya, even if 
Anya and I do share the same name in 
Russian. But at that particular mo-
ment, newly arrived in Vienna, I was 
somehow seeing the West through 
Anya's eyes. So I envied the girl in the 
cafe, I marvelled at how fortunate and 
enjoyable her life must be. Although 
Anya was still back in Leningrad, she 
and I stared at the blonde girl for a 
long time. 

It is tempting to moralize about the 
Soviet Union. Although I only spent 
the summer there, I have found since 
being home that I am expected to have 
formed a new set of political opinions 
based on my experience. My mother 
says she hopes it made me Realize 
How Luckv You Are. Realize how 
lucky you are that vou didn't gro~' up 
whispering to your friends in public 
places, passing hand-tvped "unoffical" 
manuscripts to one anmher, growing 
silent when an unexpected knock is 
heard at the door. Not to mention liv-
ing ~ .. ·ithout brightly colored clothes, 
readable books, restaurants that serve 
more than one item from the menu, 
fresh fruit all year round, and, of 
course, cheese. One hundred kinds of 
cheese. Life is Better Here. Our Socie· 
ty Is Better. It makes a very simple 
way to understand East-West rela· 
tions. 

Simplistic truisms can also originate 
from the other side of the political spec· 
trum. People Are People, They're thr 
Same Everywhere, I find myself want· 
ing to say, as the very different in· 
dividuals I knew fade back into the 
huge empty red space on my map. 
They Want Peace Too. Of course they 
do, everyone I met there told me so. 
But that's just as easy as Our Society is 
Better. They want peace, we want 
peace, we both build bombs. 

I think I stayed just long enough in 
Leningrad to realize how lucky I am. 
and to understand that people are peo· 
pie, they're the same everywhere, but 
also to recognize that while both of 
these statements are true, they don't 
really explain anything about the 
USSR. The only thing I know forcer· 
tain about the Soviet Union is that 
after I went there, an unknown blonde 
girl in a cafe looked different to me 
than she would have several months 
earlier. Maybe I saw her the way Anya 
saw me. Maybe travelling East had 
taught me something about the West. 
about how the West looks from the 
other side of Europe. 

Talking to Anya often had the quali· 
ty of watching a mirror reflection. 
When you gaze in a mirror and lift 
your right arm, the reflected figure's 
left arm moves. You might know that 
the left arm you see reflects your right 
arm, but there's no denying that the)' 
seem to be opposites. Just as the defin•· 
tions of right and left change according 
to vour angle of vision, so too do 
definitions and assumptions change ac· 
cording to which side of Europe you 
were born in. Anya, for example, was 
not your typical young builder of

Communism. She was quite critical of 
her government, not at all averse to . 
reading illegal books and quite happy 
to let. a dangerous American practice 
speakmg Russian with her. Never-
theless, she couldn't understand why 
the United States was so interested in 
Poland. She understood some of our 
disagreements with her government, 
but didn't we realize that Poland is a 
separate country from the Soviet 
Union? We seemed to care more about 
Polish trade unions than about our 
own. 

I ~ried patiently to explain how we 
cons1der Poland an occupied country, 
how there are Soviet soldiers in 
Poland, how the Polish government is 
controlled by Moscow .. Any a thought 
about that for a minute, said that was 
all probably true, but she didn't 
understand why I seemed to think that 
was any different from America's rela-
tionship to France, England or West 
G~rmany. Without animosity, she 
pomted out that America stations 
soldiers in those countries 
installs 
~issiles there, had occupied ~hose na-
tions after the war. And weren't their 
economies completely dependent upon 
ours, just as the Polish economy 
depends upon the Soviet? Well-yes, 
but no. Now, thinking back on seeing 
Coca-Cola advertisements plastered in 
the streets of Paris, hearing "Born in 
the USA" in London pubs and notic-
ing the American movies playing in 
the theaters of Munich, I understand 
even better the intense confusion I felt 
while trying to answer these questions. 
It's not that I honestly believe that the 
United States has the same relation-
ship to Western Europe that the Soviet 
Union has to Eastern Europe; it's just 
that the difference was impossible to 
explain to Anya. To her, covert 
domination was covert domination, 
whether it meant Coca-Cola signs or 
puppet dictators. 

Soldiers 
were 
soldiers, military bases were military 
bases. According to her experience and 
understanding of the way the world 
worked, they meant the same thing in 
any country. According to her defini-
tions, 
America controls Western 
Europe. And although she didn't con-
. vince me that the two situations are ac-
tuaJly the same, I didn't convince her 
that they weren't. Instead, her confu-
sion showed me how they really could 
look that way. I then thought a little bit 
harder than I might have about the im-
plications of the economic and cultural 
interdependence of the West. 

We had similar problems when I 
tried to explain about crime. "Well, 
yes, the neighborhood where I live in 
New Haven isn't particularly safe, as a 
matter of fact there are crimes which 
take place not too far from my apart-
ment ... Of course I still go out at 
night, I'm not that terrified ... Would 
someone who robbed me get caught? 
Probably not. No one guarantees that 
they would get caught ... No, I don't 
really worry about it all the time, I 
mean I guess I try to walk with friends 
at night, and even during the day some 
places aren't particularly good to go 
alone ... It's not a constant fear, real-
ly, I have to lock my doors of course 
" 

Anya thought it extraordinary that 
we had bars on our windows. Is it true 
that private citizens are allowed to · 
carry guns? She imagined constant ter-
ror, which I conceded some people 
probably feel, shooting on the streets, 
which 
I 
to admit happens, 
thousands of murders and rapes every 
year, which statistically do occur. She 
found this the single most terrifying 
aspect of life in America. She shivered, 
said she would find it unbearable not to 
be able to leave her house alone at 
night, to be afraid to walk in the 
streets. In no way could I convey to her 
how one adapts to the idea of violent 
crime, how one has to adapt in order 
not to become obsessed. Yet even as I 
spoke, I began to wonder about that at-
titude. We live in an extremely violent 
society, so violent that gun manufac-
turers are powerful enough to prevent 
a ban on handguns whose only purpose 
is to kill people. I just don't usually 
th~nk ~bout it that way. Nor does Anya 
thmk It odd that the stores in her coun-
try sell only one kind of cheese. Both of

us have adapted to our particular 
set of cultural assumptions. It's only 
when you look at the situation through 
a mirror that the peculiarities begin to 
emerge. 

The list went 
on. 
They take 
American Express at Beriozlca stores in 
the Soviet Union, stores where only 
foreigners are allowed to shop and 
must pay with foreign currency. Soviet 
citizens can be arrested for shopping 
there. Anya didn't find Bm'ozki at all 
odd, but she found American Express 
completely incomprehensible. As I 
tried to explain, I discovered that I too 
didn't completely understand how it 
was possible to walk into a store, hand 
the salesperson a piece of plastic and 
walk away with an object. It just didn't 
make sense. "And then there are gold 
ones too, people want them mostly for 
status, I think ... Yes, you have to 
pay more money, well actually you 
have to have a better credit rating ... 
Credit rating? That depends on lots of 
things: where you went to college, 
what neighborhood your house is in, 
how stable your income is . . . " 

There is no such thing as unstable 
income in the Soviet Union. Nobody 
gets fired, 
except, of course, for 
political reasons. 
Nobody is ever 
unemployed, except for 
political 
reasons. Nor is income a particularly 
good gauge of someone's status. One 
can have a high income but no access 
to foreign products, and hence a low 
standard of living. Or a low income 
and a high standard of living. Figure 
that one out. Either way, nobody 
thinks it's illogical. Anya laughed a lot 
more about American Express Gold 
Cards. She never did see the point of 
it, and come to think of it, neither did 
I. 

When Anya and I said goodbye, I 
was almost shocked at her formality. I 
hadn't expected a Russian bear hug 
and weeping, but she didn't smile or 
cry at all. Instead she wished me long 
life and good fortune, health and hap-
piness, and her iace took on the closed. 
wooden expression I had only seen her 
wear in public places. I said that I 
hoped we would see each other again. 
"Maybe," she said. One of her friends 
once told me that she and her fiance 
had considered applying for emigra· 
tion permits. I had seen her almost 
every day for two months, and she had 
never told me. 

M y train crossed the Soviet border 
at about four o'clock in the morning. 
We were delayed for five hours while 
teenage soldiers with rosy red cheeks 
ran on top of the train and others open-
ed our luggage inside. It was raining 
outside. It had been raining when we 
left Leningrad and it rained when we 
stopped in Lvov. It was still raining 
when the Hungarian soldiers woke us 
up again to stamp our passports. I 
finally fell back to sleep on my sooty 
train cot thinking about darkness, 
cold, and especially rain. 

When I first opened my eyes and 
looked outside, I saw sunflowers. The 
rain had slOpped, and through my 
window I saw miles and miles of yellow 
sunflowers, Hungarian sunflowers. 
My head felt very light, probably from 
not sleeping well. I thought about how 
one time Anya and I had been lucky 
enough to find imported sunflower 
seeds in a kolkhoz marketplace, where a 
few farmers are allowed to sell private 
goods. 
thought about how the 
sunflower seeds had been small and 
grey and a little bit rotten, and how big 
and yellow sunflowers are themselves, 
especially when seen passing in row 
after row outside your train window. I 
watched as the sunflowers gave way to 
wheat and then tiny neat houses, and 
tried to reconcile their yellow existence 
with the marketplace where I had 
tasted their grey seeds, tried to under· 
stand why I could no longer look at the 
yellowness without thinking about the 
grey.
