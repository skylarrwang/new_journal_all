There is no such thing as stasis. You feel that living in any 
city for a summer, cities reeling with people, people on 
the streets day and night. Yet, while we move through 
noise and traffic for three months, in our memories Yale 
sleeps. The humidity at a constant 95 percent, the colleges 
empty of students, nothing must be happening. But an in-
ertia persists, and when we return at the end of August, 
the campus and the lives we left here lie .deceptively quiet 
and unchanged. 


A week after arriving in New York last June, I knew 
this would be a summer of motion. The city had little to 
do with it; in fact, the tug and pull I felt came from New 
Haven. Having distanced myself from campus, I could 
see the ·whirl of events, the constant changes at the 
University that would make creating an issue over the 
summer even more difficult than I had imagined. Though 
our .staff was working and studying in different regions of 
the planet, apparently leaving the magazine dormant, The 
New Journal, particularly this first issue of Volume 18, 
contracted and expanded from May to September. It all 
started with a phone call one night from our production 
manager, who was living in New Haven this summer. 
She warned me to be calm, because we had just received 
an eviction notice from the Engineering Department. It 
seemed the verbal lease on our Becton storage closet-cum-
office had just expired. The department needed the space 
for the overflow of engineering journals from the library. 
Mild panic, strategic phone calls, productive talks with 
Dean ~uttle and finally, surprisingly quickly, office 312 
at 305 Crown Street, upstairs from the Kosher Kitchen 
and the Film Studies Center. 


That may have been The Event of the summer for us. 
B\,lt each week some issue or person from The New Journal 
jarred the status quo. The state of the magazine changed 
every seven to ten days, and permanence became fic-
tional. An interview subject would be arriving in New 
York in three days, while the vvriter of the article was liv-
ing in London, unaware that questions were needed, with 
landlords who refused to give him urgent phone 
messages. At another point, more than half our small 
photo staff could not return early to work on this issue, 
and for all I knew, our associate photo editor had never 
received the letter I'd sent him in Beijing explaining the 
situation. Two stories had to be cut from our original 
September story list reducing our prospective major ar-
ticles to three. One of which had yet to be researched 
when the staff arrived in New Haven on August 18, with 
hopes of gluing together text, photos, ads and graphics in-
to the coherent order of magazine. 


I had seen the m·otions of late summer before, but with 
some other man or woman responsil?le for every word of 
copy going into .The New Journal. Although I had already 
served as editor-in-chief for one previous is ue none of 
our sources were vacationing on the Vine ard or in the 
woods then. During the school year our writer could use 
the Connecticut Hall Macintoshes for tories that have to 
be on a computer disc. We carne to New Ha en the com~ 
puter room was locked those with the ke · s out of town. 


Then, there was the staff. Everyone appeared o ten ibl 
ready to work. Yet how do you return to immerse yourself 
in Yale after a summer in Leningrad or eight months in 
China, after researching a book or reporting from one of 
Time's domestic bureaus? In a few days, however, 
the emotional jet-lag disappears, as you witness the 
business manager's excitement over the sale of a full-
page ad and a writer working on the rough draft· of his 
story throughout the night.. 


Our production manager doesn't like all-nighters. Why 
can't we be organized, she asks wistfully, instead of 
frenetically piecing together the entire issue over a 
weekend? Because just then do you truly feel the intensity 
of journalism, its separation from any nine-to-five job. 
People argue and create and compromise all in the effort 
to put words and images onto paper, print the product 
11,000 times and .then deliver it to the Yale community. 


This year, we feel the pressure of tradition and expecta-
tion upon us, as The New Journal celebrates its fifth year in 
its current format. The magazine began in tabloid form in 
1969, and after several prosperous years, died slowly in 
the late 1970s, Xerox art on the covers and wildly arcane 
fiction within. In 1981, it was revived as a news and 
features magazine focusing on Yale and New Haven. We 
simply don't have the resources to cover civil · war in 
Nicaragua nor the latest music out of Philadelphia. Yet 
we realize national trends affect New Haven; sometimes 
they are born here. Our readers learn that AIDS, abor-
tion rights and poverty are not remote issues but are tied 
intimately to their lives. While every writer and editor for . 
The New Journal fears at one time or another that the story 
ideas will run out, somehow both city and University re-
main fertile, dynamic sources of articles. 


The magazine itself, however, worries about the 
writers- and business and produc~ion staffs, photograph-
ers, designers, artists. In late May, the seniors on the 
magazine graduate, and the newly-elected officers leave 
for the summer 
eeing only huge gaps in the masthead. 


An editor I know at Northwestern faced a similar prob-: 
lem. At a gathering several weeks ago, she asked the 
speaker what she should do when she returns this fall and 
has to pull a newspaper staff out of thin air. The speaker 
told her that she needed only two people. One should be 
the stickler,' the absolute, unforgiving perfectionist never 
satisfied with a story or photo or ad. The kind of person 
who holds onto the final draft of an article until you 
literally tear it out of her hands. The other is the creative 
force, perpetually brain torming, who should be coddled, 
pampered anything to keep him bubbling with ideas. The 
New Journal has room for more than two for perfectionists 
and brainstormers alike, and for all the shades and com-
binations of drive and creativity in between. 


Fi ·e more times thi academic year, we will again come 
out of the night replete wi(h our sticklers and bubblers, 
sleep writer and ner ous production people, Newsjour-
nal and Afterthought . Each issue will give you a new 
view on Yale and New Haven, as they change from hour 
to day to month. lfthat view provoke anger satisfaction, 
correction boredom let us know. Challenge us, because 
ever month we hope to challenge ou.
