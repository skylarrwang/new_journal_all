During the second annual Pro-Life Ac-
tivist$ convention last April, a sign 
hanging outside the convention center 
read: 

~welcome Pro-Life Activists: 
Have a Blast." The welcome was 
fri~~;hteningly appropriate, considering 
that one of the speakers, Curtis Beseda, 
addressed the assemblv from federal 
pri~on. where he IS ~ow serving a 
20-year sentence for the bombing of an 
abortion clinic in Washington. Increasingly, violence has been userl by 
pro·lifers in the debate over abortion 

The most radical ami-abortion ac-
tivists often have resorted to van-
dalism, arson and bombings to com-
municatt• their ang..-r over legalized 
abortion. 

~cw Ha,·en has not es-
caped the national trend Since Jan-
uarv. 1985. the New Ha,·en branch 
of Planned Parenthood of Connecticut 
(PPC) ha~ been the subject of at least 
fifteen incidents of harassment. and 
there is no si~n of a decrease in the 
future The chnic. which performs a 
variety of <el'\·iccs ran~n~ from infer-
ulit)' <en ices to abortions. has en-
countered 
picketin~ outside the 
building and menacmg telephone calls 
to both <tafT and patients. repeated 
bomb 
threat~ and finally. a five-


person invasion of the building on July 
20. 

"We're furious . I mean, I'm incensed 
that in a democracy, this sort of thing 
can go on," said Dr. Joan Babbott, ex-
ecutive director of PPC. According to 
Babbott, the invasion occurred at ap-
proximately 7:30a.m., July 20, as five 
people entered the clinic and proceded 
to hand out anti-abortion literature to 
the patients_ Three of the anti-
abortionists forced their way into a 
back procedure room and unwrapped 
trays of sterilized instruments, while 
picketers cheered outside. After 20 
minutes, the five trespassers were 
removed by the police, and they are 
now 
facing 
criminal 
prosecution. 

Though the clinic was closed for the 
rest of the day, no serious damage was 
done. 

Babbott believes that instead of in-
spiring fear, incidents such as these 
have heightened the esprit de c0rps 
among the staff: "When you're beseig-
ed, 
you consolidate." The pre-
dominant emotion after the inva-
sion among both staff and patients, 
said Kathy Irben, program director for 
the New Haven branch, was anger. 
People were "feeling for the first time 
that our rights could go down the 
tubes." Though Babbott is disturbed 
by the incidents, she emphasizes that 
~in no way are we going to stop offer-
tng services." 

John Grant, who has participated in 
the sit-in and in demonstrations at 
PPC , points to the non-violent nature 
of his methods. He has been involved 
in sidewalk counseling, which consists 
of "quietly offering alternatives" to 
women entering the clinic. While 
agteeing with PPC's account of the 
July 20 incident, he stresses that the 
maneuver was carried out "very quietly 
and peacefully." The pu·rpose, he ex-
plained, was not to intimidate or 
frighten staff and patients, but to make 
oneself entirely vulnerable to them, 
and 
thereby distract 
them from 
performing abortions. 

In spite of 
PPC's claim that these demonstrations 
ha~e strengthened morale, Grant 
~amtains that only such constant ac-
tion will lead to the repeal of abortion:
