Offensive linemen working to perfect their blocking techniques 
"You could always go to a football factory like Texas, but what good would It do you?" 
at Yale, you carry a burden, because as 
soon as one of us slips up the fault is at-
tributed to the entire team. You must 
carry yourself better, because it's 
always a football player's fault." 
Most players feel that reputation 
promotes the insularity for which they 
are criticized. "You get fed up with the 
prejudices after a while and you tend to 
bond together," Duryea explained. 
"Then you begin to act the way people 
stereotype you. People preconceive the 
jock and the a"thlete develops a "jock" 
aura. One feeds the other. It's not 
good, but it happens." To Duryea, the 
football team seems to Yale as Yale 
seems to New Haven, a closed and in-
timidating community. 

Perhaps the only time the entire 
Yale communitv backs the football 
team is for The 'came, more often an 
excuse for a party than an athletic 
event. But the players don't resent hav-
ing such erratic support. "If we are be-
ing used, it really doesn't matter," 
R yan said. "In a selfish way, we can't 
do it for anyone else but ourselves. We 
have to function as though we have no 
support at all, so if no one were around 
we could still do it on our own. It's 
what I'd like to think, but I hope I 
never have to find out." 

Players like Skwara, an offensive 
tackle, can't rely on fan support for in-
spiration. Unlike a quarterback or 
receiver, Skwara plays a game of 
anonymity, 
trying to contain the 
defense while opening holes for run-
ning backs. "You don't get much 
recognition outside of the offensive 
team," Skwara said. "I get a deeper 
satisfaction out of my own work, even 
if it's a few plays in scrimmage that I 
did well. No statistics can tell vou how 
well you did." Lately Skwara has found 
a new way to help his game, a process 
of mental training. and visualization, 
picturing the perfect· block or the 
perfect play over and over again. 

Rarely, if ever, does Skwara actually 
make the ultimate block, but he still 
believes that visualization improves his 
performance. Occasionally the fan-
tasizing gets out of hand, such as the 
time Skwara went running and 
daydreamed about the perfect game.


Most players feel that 
reputation promotes 
the insularity for 
which they are 
criticized. "You get fed 
up with the prejudices 
after a while and you 
tend to bond 
together," Duryea 
explained. "Then you 
begin to act the way 
people stereotype you. 

He saw the ball fumbled during a play, 
saw himself picking it up, running 
down the field 
past the confused 
defense and into the end-zone. When 
Skwara snapped out of his dream, he 
found himself two miles further down 
the road. 

On Old Campus, a group of large 
young men returns from Ray Tom-
pkins House after another_ long even-
ing with the coaches and staff. Dressed 
in clean shorts and t-shirts, showered , 
relaxed and exhausted, they lumber 
through the Vanderbilt archway and 
slowly begin to separate, moving 
toward their entryways and their beds. 
Except for the sound of an occasional 
·::~dio , Vanderbilt grows quiet. Lights 
are turned off. The players lie in their 
beds. In the back of their minds they 
know what tomorrow holds for them: 
another hit, another drill, done for no 
one's satisfaction but their own .
