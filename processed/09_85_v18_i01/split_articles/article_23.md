The New Journal stands out. While the media hypes the 
evolution from hippies to yuppies as the 1960s yield to the 
1980s, everyone talks about protest giving way to pre-
professionalism on college campuses. It seems everyone is 
trying to become a professional. 

At The New Journal, professionalism means something 
different. It's an attitude towards our work which means 
conducting ourselves as professional journalists and 
publishers. Professionalism is a commitment to fulfilling our 
responsibilities to our advertisers and readers. It means 
striving to balance serious magazine work with serious fun. 

Professionalism also means knowing we can't face the 
constant challenges of publishing a newsmagazine simply by 
following the same old rules. It means realizing It's as 
important to learn from new people as it is to teach them what 
we already know.

September 9 at 7:30pm. If you can't make it, call Publisher
