eighteen hundred 
pounds of meat and 
ambition and ego into 
a thin shell that 
weighed about 180 
pounds and then mak-
ing it work."

**Title: The Amateurs**

The Amateurs 
David H alberstam 
1985 W illiam Morrow and Company, 
Inc. 
After three years of frustration with 
newspaper and magazine articles 
about rowing, I concluded that it is dif-
ficult to write about crew and impossi-
ble to do it well. The sportswriter 
assigned to a race must negotiate the 
mercilessly narrow gap between crew's 
twin dangers: the sport is, on one side, 
thoroughly saturated with terms alien 
to the general public; yet on the other 
side, crew is amazingly simple. What 
could be more basic, what could be 
(I'm almost afraid to ask) more boring 
than two boats going down a river to 
see which 
is 
faster? Surely, any 
reporter could describe a boat race 
without bringing in any of those cryp-
tic terms: "the catch" or "power-ten" or 
"up-two" or "three-seats-up" or "a-bow-
deck-down" or "weigh-enough." But 
jargon always manages to slip into the 
articles. We rowers cringe, knowing 
that most readers are nodding their 
heads politely without really under-
standing just what happened out on 
that river. 

While the premise of David 
Halberstam's The Amateurs intrigued 
me, I remained skeptical of yet another 
journalist's attempt at wrestling with the 
experience and language of rowing. But 
a lew awkward exceptions aside, The 
Amateurs proved more successful at 
taming the terminology of crew than I 
I ' 
imagined possible. Moreover, Halber-
stam effectively communicates to both 
rowers and laymen the rarefied spirit 
of amateur athletics. 

In an entertatntng, 
if often 
overdramatic account of the endeavors 
of four world-class oarsmen, the author 
reveals what makes amateurs special 
and quite separate from professionals. 
Halberstam's 
not so much 
a 
continuous narrative as a series of 
vignettes 
concer ning driven, 
independent athletes. The characters, 
Yale graduates John Biglow, '79, and 
Joe Bouscaren, '80, TifT Wood of 
Harvard and Brad Lewis of University 
of California-Irvine, 
all 
strive 
to 
become the top single sculler in the 
nation, and so, represent the U.S. at 
the 
1984 Summer Olympics. 

Halberstam devotes individual 
chapters to his oarsmen, hoping to 
explain the lives and ambitions of each: 
the older, graceless Wood; the insecure 
Westerner Lewis; the tenacious 
Bouscaren and the strangely volatile 
Biglow, the ultimate winner of the title. 
Although the men come together for 
the U.S. single-sculling championship, 
the chapters seldo_m overlap. Rather, 
the book frequently reads like a string 
of exciting yet loosely related sports 
pages. If Halberstam meant to write a 
biographical novel or even a simple 
story, his disjointed approach seriously 
undermines his efforts. 

Therefore, the power of the work 
lies neither with the plot nor structur:e,
