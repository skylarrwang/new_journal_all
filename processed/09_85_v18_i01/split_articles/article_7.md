On the evening of August 19, a single meter on the transmission console in WYBC's FM studio still twitched. 

Four red lights surrounding the meter still glowed dully in the semi-darkness, and a low, monotonous hum was still audible. Yet the flourescent ceiling lights were unlit and the deejays' chair lay empty. Neither of the two motionless turntables held records, and both tone-arms rested silently in their brackets. WYBC, the Yale Broadcasting Company, was off the air.


Less than a week earlier on August 13, Gerald Etkind, WYBC's program director, had occupied the old swivel chair in front of the microphone. He had relieved the regularly scheduled deejay and sat purposefully before the controls. Apologizing to his listeners, Etkind explained that WYBC was forced to discontinue broadcasting for technical reasons. Promising "we shall return," Etkind ceased transmission and logged the station off the air at 1:16 p.m. Later, deejays arrived for their scheduled air play and could not enter the studios. A contest winner was unable to collect his free album. And station members rapidly discovered that their keys no longer fit the locks; Lloyd Suttle, dean of administrative and student affairs, had ordered them changed when the station closed.


The shutdown marked the end of a phase in WYBC's long and colorful history. Founded in 1941, the station initially broadcast only to Yale's residential colleges via a closed-circuit AM channel. Seven years later, the station was incorporated into the state of Connecticut as a non-profit, tax-exempt corporation. The organization expanded in the 1950s to include a record-producing venture and a television branch that broadcast to Yale's colleges from 1953 to 1954. In 1958 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted WYBC a license to transmit beyond Yale, and it became the first college radio station in the country to broadcast 24 hours a day. This growth led the way for WYBC to begin FM transmission in 1959.


As no music and no words left the station, however, history mattered little. Many questions arose concerning the shutdown. Station members wanted to know why Richard "Thor" Moser, SY '86, WYBC's general manager, had not given them any advance warning. Why had Moser not told Etkind, a WYBC Executive Board (£-board) member, until 90 minutes before the scheduled closing? And why was Moser's only explanation a letter taped to the station's locked blue doors on the second floor of Hendrie Hall: "Due to technical problems with our transmitter, the WYBC Board of Governors has directed me to close the station . . . The station will be closed and secured until the problem is solved."


As the story behind the closing began to unfold, station members realized a single reason for the decision would not be found. Instead, the shutdown was the culmination of a confusing array of circumstances. "WYBC is like a pressure cooker that keeps cooking and cooking," said Station Manager Drew Cooper, DC '87. "You're surprised when it explodes, but you knew it would. You just weren't sure when and why."


On August 19, Suttle met with about 15 station members in WYBC's £-board office to discuss the "why." In the hot and crowded office, Suttle explained that the decision had been made by himself, Moser and WYBC's Board of Governors, an advisory body set up through the station's by-laws to insure that WYBC operates in compliance with public law, Yale regulations and its own by-laws. Moser was present, but spoke infrequently, choosing to remain in the background. The members of the Board of Governors were absent, their true position and influence remaining ambiguous.
