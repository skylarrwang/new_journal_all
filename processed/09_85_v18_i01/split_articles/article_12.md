Perhaps in a century historians will 
argue that the breakthrough came 
when an aging actor shocked the 
United States by announcing that he 
was ill- dying, really- from acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome, better 
known as AIDS. Rock Hudson's 
declaration made it impossible for 
Americans not to have at least heard of 
the disease, as countless magazines 
plastered Hudson's gaunt, tired face on 
their covers. The pictures showed a 
man who looked like he was dying. For 
the majority of Americans, it was the 
lint time they were touched by a 
disease that could no longer be ig-
nored. 


For the victims who have known for 
yean about the grim realities of AIDS, 
the tremendous amount of media 
coverage Rock Hudson attracted for 
the disease was indeed a breakthrough. 
There have been over 12,000 cases of 
AIDS since the epidemic was first 
identified in 1981, and over 6,000 of 
those patients are dead. The great ma-
jority of them are gay men, and for 
years the gay community 
has 
desperately tried to win the attention of 
straight America. All of a sudden, they 
had it. 


Gay men are not the only ones en-
couraged by 
the 
media 
blitz. 
Awareness is a critical problem for 
doctors and scientists all over the coun-
try struggling to prevent the spread of 
an incredibly complex, inevitably fatal 
disease. One such person is Dr. John 
Rankin, 
Assistant Professor of 
Medicine at 
Yale-New Haven 
Hospital. As a physician, Rankin cares 
for many of the AIDS patients who 
come to the hospital. Though he can 
not save their lives, he can prolong 
them by treating the secondary 
diseases that attack the constitutions of 
AIDS patients. 


A 
pulmonary 
specialist, Rankin also studies the 
AIDS virus' devastating ability to shut 
down the immune systems of the 
human lung.

than 35, dressed casually, with long "A very close friend of

his habit of furiously, constantly scrib-
S. 
bling notes while he talks, scrawls full 
of medical jargon, incomprehensible to 
the layman. But Rankin's words reveal 
a highly intelligent, highly compas-
sionate man, willing to share his time 
so people will hear his warnings about 
AIDS. 


"An AIDS vaccine is not six or eight 
or ten months away, but longer than 
that," Rankin said. "It'll probably be 
years- and that's not even for a cure. 
That's only prevention. In the mean-
time, the disease is going to keep 
spreading in numbers so high it's dif-
ficult to imagine. The gay population 
in particular is going to be very, very 
hard hit. 


"The rough estimate is that ten per-
cent of the adult males in the United 
States are gay, depending on exactly 
how you define gay, meaning purely 
homosexual, bisexual, whatever. Now, 
there are about 200 million people in 
the country, about half of those people 
are male- that makes for some ten 
million gay men." 


He paused, tapping one finger 
cautiously on the table. "We believe 
. . . there is a good chance that within 
the next ten years every gay man in 
this country will test positive for the 
HTL V-III antibody, which is 
developed by the body after it has been 
exposed to the AIDS virus. Of those 
men, about ten percent will come 
down with AIDS. That is about a 
million deaths in 
the next 
ten 
years-and that's in the gay population 
alone. That's leaving out all the 
heterosexual contacts with prostitutes, 
the hemophiliacs, the blood transfu-
sions, the wives of bisexual men." 


Unless, of course, scientists can 
develop a vaccine for AIDS, but no 
one in the medical community seems 
optimistic about the chances for a vac-
cine in the near future. The reason: 
AIDS cripples the body's defenses in a
