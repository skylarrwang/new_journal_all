From Fact to Fiction 
by Shelley Fisher Fishkin 
1985 Johns Hopkins University Press 

Newspaper reporters, whether chasing 
firetrucks or sneaking around city 
halls, are the hands-on chroniclers of 
life 
in 
America. Though seldom 
praised for their eloquence or creativity, most reporters are driven by a 
sincere desire to expose the truth about 
things monumental and insignificant. 
But the daily grind of journalism limits 
a reporter from becoming a writer, making it difficult to express truths more 
complex than who, what, where, when 
and why. Frustrated by the incessant 
demands of deadlines, cynical editors 
and uncommitted audiences, many 
reporters dream of writing fiction. 

Only a few do, however, and even they 
bring with them the values and techniques of their experiences in journalism. 

In her new book *From Fact to Fiction*, 
Shelley Fisher Fishkin, former director 
of Yale's Poynter Fellowship in journalism, argues that "an astonishing 
proportion of major American writers 
since Whitman learned their craft as 
reporters of fact." Fishkin makes her 
case by documenting the careers and 
writings of five major reporters who 
turned to fiction: Walt Whitman, 
Theodore Dreiser, Ernest Hemingway, 
John Dos Passos and Mark 
Twain. All spent years working for 
magazines and newspapers before taking up fiction, and the experience in 
city streets, warfare and social injustice 
they gained as reporters figured prominently in their fiction. Mark Twain, 
for example, wrote stories about the 
racism he witnessed as a reporter, 
while Dreiser wrote of the poverty and 
the wealth he saw in New York. According to Fishkin, 
the tendency 
towards "immersion in experience" 
fostered by these former journalists is 
crucial to defining 
the American 
aesthetic, helping to answer the long-
debated question of what is American 
about American literature. 

After a short introduction, Fishkin 
devotes one chapter to each author, including autobiographical details of the 
writers' newspaper careers, analysis 
and excerpts of their newspaper articles, 
and most importantly, a discussion of 
how their early articles influenced their 
later fiction. 

The Whitman chapter 
opens with 12-year-old Walt taking 
his first journalism job at the Long 
Island Patriot, then focuses on his experiences in the streets of New Yorkâ€”
the people and scenes that became 
the stuff of his poetry. Fishkin reprints 
"Life in a New York Market," an article Whitman wrote when editor of the 
Aurora, then a major New York daily. 

While other papers covered the market 
by reporting the day's prices and products, Whitman described the market's 
sellers, buyers and wares in colorful, 
evocative language. Fishkin points out 
that the market characters and the style 
of Whitman's article are virtually 
duplicated in "Song of Myself," his 
best-known work. 

From addressing how on-the-job experiences influenced the writing of 
these five men, Fishkin then explores 
how their work influenced American 
fiction. 
Twain, 
Fishkin 
asserts, 
developed his characteristic technique 
of juxtaposing varied moods and styles 
while writing letters as a traveling correspondent. While on a sea voyage in 
1867, Twain provided a variety of 
episodes in his letters, ranging from 
the tragic death of a child to the amusing downfall of a con man to a standard landscape description. The same 
technique plays prominently in the 
Picaresque style of *Huckleberry Finn*. 

Similarly, 
traces Hemingway's style back to his first reporting job at the Kansas City Star. The 
Star's style sheet reads like a Hemingway guide to better writing: "Use 
short paragraphs. 
Use vigorous 
English. Be positive, not negative. 
Avoid use of adjectives, especially such 
extravagant ones as splendid, 
gorgeous, 
magnificent, 
etc." The 
brevity and simplicity acquired at the 
Star became Hemingway's trademark 
as a writer. 

Although these writers brought their 
experience as reporters to their fiction, 
they all found journalism an inadequate means of expression. "While a 
journalist could hope, at best, to shape 
the 
reader's 
view of a 
specific 
phenomenon or event, the imaginative 
writer aspired to nothing less than 
transforming the reader's way of seeing," Fishkin writes. Aside from the 
constraints of journalistic language, all 
these writers experienced some form of 
censorship. While reporting in San 
Francisco, Twain was sympathetic to 
the discrimination practiced against 
Chinese merchants, but his articles on 
the subject were harshly cut by 
newspapers reluctant to endanger their 
subscription rates. Twain turned to 
tongue-in-cheek fiction to express his 
views. In one satire, "Disgraceful 
Persecution of a Boy," a young lad 
makes the ironic statement, "God will 
not love me if I do not stone (the 
Chinaman)." The line clearly anticipates Huck Finn's words when he 
decides not to turn in Jim, the 
runaway slave: "All right, then, I'll go 
to hell." 

The only disappointing aspect of 
*From 
Fact 
to 
Fiction* 
is 
Fishkin's 
epilogue, a cocktail party discussion of 
recent attempts to pass off fiction as 
fact. 
After 
mentioning 
Norman 
Mailer's 
*Executioner's Song*, Janet 
Cooke's Pulitzer-Prize-winning hoax 
and Alistair Reid's use of composites in 
*The New Yorker*, Fishkin draws the 
simplistic conclusion that journalists 
are quite welcome to turn to fiction, 
but they should avoid writing fictitious 
facts. An apparent attempt to fit the 
rest of the book in a present-day context, the message falls flat in comparison with the interesting material in 
the preceding pages. 

Overall, however, *From Fact to Fiction* 
is a readable, well-researched contribution to the study of American 
literature, articulating thoroughly and 
persuasively the 
influence of journalism and journalists on American 
letters.
