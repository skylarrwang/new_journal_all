years. "A large percentage of my prac-
tice consists of gay individuals who 
come here either with a very specific 
problem, or who just want to come and 
be checked out and learn about AIDS," 
Gager explained. There is certainly 
ample cause for such concern; as of 
August 21, there were 144 cases of 
AIDS in Connecticut, making this 
state 13th in AIDS cases in the na-
tion- a high ranking considering that 
Connecticut is one of the smallest 
states in the country. Eighty-six of 
those victims are gay or bisexual men, 
78 are dead and 43 are from New 
Haven County. It is no wonder that 
gay men come to a doctor whom they 
know is sympathetic. 

Indeed, Gager acts as a reliable 
source of information in an apprehen-
sive gay community which eagerly 
consumes new rumors about AIDS 
research. Gager finds the hardest part 
of such a role is dispelling the terror 
and myths which surround the disease. 
To do that, he has to talk bluntly about 
the specifics of AIDS, how you can get 
the disease and how you can't. "My 
feel~ng is that you will get the virus if 
dunng sexual contact there is some 
kind of open abrasion on the body," 
Gager said. "I can't be sure, but I think 
the transmission of the virus is via the 
blood more than anything else. I really 
don't harp on the theory of the ex-
change of bodily fluids like semen and 
saliva. I think that theory leads to the 
false conception that if during sex you 
go almost to the point of orgasm, but 
don't actually have orgasm, you won't 
spread the disease. This is just not so." 

Despite Gager's dedication, his fre-
quent contact with AIDS patients can 
be a tremendous strain. "It's very 
~isenchanting to see someone usually 
In the prime of their life, in their tv."enries or 
thirties, come down "'-ith a disease that you 
can't cure," Gager said. "You get 
frustrated. You'd like to have a day ofT 
when you're able not to think about it. 
But no matter what you feel inside, 
you have to give people hope. Without 
that, they have nothing to live for. 
Whether that helps them make it three 
months longer, six months longer, I 
don't know, but you have to try." 

For Novick, giving hope to an AIDS 
patient means being able to tell him 
that he won't lose his job, or be evicted 
from his apartment, or go broke pay-
ing hospital bills. Novi& admits that 
the day when AIDS patients are free of 
such worries is far ofT, in part because 
AIDS victims have so few spokes-
people, in part because of unpleasant 
but omnipresent human traits like 
selfishness and bigotry. "What we are 
seeing in the social and medical 
responses to this disease is the direct 
conflict between a tradition of pre-
judice and the health care needs of a 
large group of American society," 
Novick charged. "People who have 
AIDS or who are in a risk group can 
suffer severe social punishment if their 
lifestyle or illness is known. I am lucky; 
I am in an academic setting where I'm 
allowed to speak out. But I am also a 
gay man, a physician and a scientist. I 
have a responsibility." 

In 1982 Novick began to study 
the ethical issues raised by this new 
disease but which the federal and 
state governments were ignoring. 
What he found was that, as if having 
the disease were not enough of a 
burden, an AIDS victim has virtually 
none of the civil rights largely taken for 
granted in this country. Novick, an 
older man with graying hair and a 
white beard, almost grandfatherly in 
manner, speaks angrily of such dis-
crimination. "The situation is bad 
enough in Connecticut for gay people. 
We have no rights. If you're gay, you 
can be fired, evicted, denied public ac-
comodations and transportation. Now, 
I don't know how often these things 
happen to gays, but they do happen to 
gays who have AIDS. And I don't 
think it's fear so much as hostility. 
Because 
homophobia 
is 
the only 
widespread, socially acceptable form of 
btgotry in America today. You see it in 
the movies,

the media-every-
where." 

To fight such prejudice, Novick con-
centrates his <'f'fons on five issues: risk 
reduction, to reach the public about 
prevention: education for health care 
professionals. to limit the kind of prob-
lem Laurie Helprin encountered while 
trying to gt•t treatment; access to 
health care. '"hether it be in a hospital, 
home or hospice: ethical concerns. such 
as whether to allow a child with AIDS 
to attend school; and public advocacy.

So far, it hasn't been easy. Most doc-
tors are reluctant to listen to Novick. 
who explained, "I'm trying to educate 
people who feel they already are the 
ultimate in compassion and sensitivity. 
But having a license to practice doesn't 
make you compassionate. So there are 
a lot of doctors 1 can't reach. I can reach 
medical 
students, 
social 
workers, 
nurses, home aids, emergency medical 
personnel and morticians." 

But to be most effective, Novick has 
to reach those people one by one, ex-
pending time he feels AIDS victims 
can scarcely afford. H e doesn't expect 
any kind of AIDS vaccine until at least 
five years from now and maybe not un-
til the beginning of the next century. 
Until then, despite the efforts of in-
dividuals 
like 
Gager, 
Miller and 
Rankin, Novick warns that the social 
divisions caused by AIDS will continue 
to worsen 
As they do, the critical 
question .... ill 
become whether the 
American public will respond to AIDS 
with reason and caring or .. , ith fear and 
hatred. For gav'>, who can sull be sent 
to prison in 23 states for having sex in 
their own homes, the prospect of an 
angry nation torn apart by AIDS can 
only hurt their chances for acceptance 
in American society.
