Cole, the newspaper's publisher. By 
the end of the week Zelitch and ·Cole 
had also resigned. 
The Independent 
disintegrated as 
quickly. and dramatically as it burst 
onto New Haven's political scene. 
Three young journalists and a com-
munity activist founded the weekly 
newspaper in 1986, as an ambitious 
experiment in progressive journalism. 
The New Haven Register, the city's only 
daily, was then a family-owned mono-
poly that catered to a 
suburban 
audience and editorialized with right-
wing fervor. The New Haven Advocate 
offered a 
kind of "alternative" 
journalism, especially for arts and 
entertainment coverage, but it aimed 
mostly at the region's hip baby-boomer 
population. Neither paper focused on 
the city's socially and ethnically diverse 
neighborhoods. The Iruiependent would. 
The paper's fU"St executive editor, 
Paul Bass OE '82), met his future wife 
and associate editor Carole Smith 
(SY '83) when both worked as student 
writers for the 
Yale Daily News. 
Together with a community organizer 
named Cynthia Savo and her husband 
Bruce Shapiro of the Advocate, they 
launched their idealistic scheme for a 
gritty, 
community-based weekly. 
About half of New Haven's house-
holds, 
roughly 24,000, 
eventually 
made the mailing list. 
With Savo as their publisher, the 
foursome ran their little office on 
Chapel Street with the same progres-
sive spirit that bubbled over in the 
pages of the new weekly. The founders 
10 The New Journal/December 1, 1989 
decided all matters by consensus, and 
together became known in the office 
simply as "P.C.B.C.," after their first 
initials. 
The. whole 
staff, 
from 
receptionist to executive editor, 
participated in meetings and received 
equally meager salaries of $21 '000 a 
year. "Everyone, not just the writers, 
believed in the paper's mission," 
Shapiro recalled. "The only place I've 
seen that kind of passion is in political 
campaigns." 
"As time went on, 
Cole became more 
and more like Lady 
Macbeth." 
The grassroots activism that would 
inspire John Daniels' populist bid for 
mayor began finding a voice in the 
pages of the Independent. "The office 
was like a community center," Savo 
said, referring to the constant bustle of 
visitors from all around town. "A lot of 
neighborhood activists became aware 
of what was going on in other neigh-
borhoods, and realized they were 
facing the same problems." Savo and 
the paper's two full-time reporters, 
Khalid Lum and Elizabeth Coonrod, 
used their ties in New Haven's Italian, 
'African-American and Latino commu-
nities to bring out stories neglected by 
the other newspapers. 
"We · never condescended to our 
readers," Bass said. Not everyone 
agreed. Superintendent of Schools 
John Dow, Jr. sued the paper for libel 
after it lambasted him in one of its 
typically unambiguous editorials. In 
what the 
Connecticut Law Review 
deemed a "landmark" decision for 
freedom of the press, a Superior Court 
judge defended the Independents right to 
characterize Dow as "an ignorant, 
spineless politician" who should "go 
back to elementary school and take a 
civics class." Joel Schiavone, the 
developer responsible for the chic row 
of shops on Chapel Street, wrote a 
letter threatening an advertising 
boycott from all of his "entities" after 
the paper criticized his Shubert 
Theater project. The Independent called 
his bluff, publishing the letter the next 
week on the letters-to-the-editor page. 
The newspaper unearthed conflicts 
of interest in New Haven's Housing 
and Urban Development projects way 
back in 1987. Two years later, when 
the HUD scandal became national 
news, the New York Times credited the 
Independent for breaking the story. In 
another muckraking coup, the paper 
exposed an outbreak of liver poisoning 
at the Fair Haven Heights chemical 
plant of U retek Inc. Federal officials at 
the Occupation~ Safety and Health 
Administration read the story, and 
eventually slapped the company with a 
record fme.
