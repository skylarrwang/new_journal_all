EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
while living in New Haven for the past 
two years without a home. Most nights 
he sleeps in the Columbus House 
Shelter on York Street, where he is 
forced to leave each morning by 7 a.m. 
During the day he spends his time 
walking around, gathering ideas and 
materials for new pieces. He has no set 
schedule. If the weather is nice Milind 
can spend the day drawing. If it rains 
he has to look for shelter for himself 
and his art. "In retrospect I don't know 
if I would have chosen to be an artist," 
he said, although now his work takes 
up all his time. "It has become an 
existence and a reality for me." 
Each of Milind's works of art re-
quires tremendous effort. Since he 
cannot afford to purchase materials, he 
composes his pieces- from objects he 
finds, such as a discarded television 
set, a magazine ad, and a toothbrush. 
He also draws piqures from scenes in 
his imagination. Milind has no place to 
store his art, so if he does not sell it 
immediately he m\1st ask someone to 
hold it for him, or give it away. Before 
creating a sculpture he hides the 
materials he has selected in secret 
pockets around the city. Milind said he 
has gathered enough elements now to 
make a new sculpture. He refers to this 
collection as "the fall harvest." 


Milind seldom shaves and wears 
layers of dusty, baggy clothing. "AU I 
have is what you see," he said. He held 
up his arms to display his wardrobe, 
and pointed to his sketchbook, a gift 
from a Yale student, overloaded with 
wrinkled papers and breaking at the 
seams. Despite his disheveled appear-
ance, Milind chooses his words care-
fully from a large, varied vocabulary. 
He speaks five languages and holds a 
bachelor's degree in electrical 
engineering from the Indian Institute 
of Technology and a master's degree in 
physics from the City College of New 
York. 


After receiving his degree in physics 
twelve years ago, Milind decided to 
stay in the U.S. to look for a high-
paying job. Soon, he said, he was 
making more than $40,000 a year as a 
COmputer operator. Two years ago he 
came home from work to find a lock-
smith changing the locks on his door. 
"Then the moving men came and just 
began to take it all away," he said. 
Milind had a visa which allowed him 
only to study. He had been working in 
America as an illegal allien. To make 
matters worse, Milind also refused to 
pay his taxes, citing ethical and 
"logical" reasons for not doing so. 
"Income taxes give incentive to the 
parasite," he said. Rather than return 
to India, where he could likely find 
work given his level of education, 
Milind said he prefers to remain in 
America in the hope that he will soon 
obtain U.S. 
citizenship. "Unfor-
tunately," he said, "the work has been 
moving at a snail's pace." 


Although he has had no formal 
artistic training, Milind has been 
fascinated with art since he was young. 
He said he has visited the Louvre and 
the Vatican, and has explored the 
great museums of Amsterdam, 
Florence, New York and New Haven. 
At one time, Milind said, he viewed 
artwork like a tourist. Now that he is 
"deliberately and 
consciously" an 
artist, he said he sees far more in each 
piece of art and is improving with each 
new work. "This is like my going to art 
school," he said. 


Drawing from two major sources of 
inspiration, science and ancient Greek 
art, Milind creates drawings that 
combine the two influences in surreal 
landscapes. One of Milind's drawings 
features a distorted ancient Greek 
statue against an outer-space back-
ground. 
Milind said he titled it 
~Ganymede" after a satellite of jupiter. 
In another of his works Milind has 
scratched scientific formulas into thick 
layers of color. Embedded among 
other images is a diagram of a plu-
tonium-powered rocket engine he 
designed. 


Milind would like to have a show of 
his work. But, he said, he cannot 
transform many of his ideas into 
drawings and sculpture because he has 
no home or money. His ideal show 
would take place outdoors, with room 
for huge sculptures. So far he has sold 
two pieces, each for $60. For now, the, 
sculpture he gave to Anderson is sitting 
in a storage room at the Kosher 
Kitchen.
