Quiet and contemplative, C. Vann Woodward speaks in a soft Southern drawl, carefully weighing his words before offering them. Though he retired from the Yale history faculty in 1977, he still keeps a sparse and slightly dusty office in the Hall of Graduate Studies. In conversation, he leans forward attentively. He is self-assured, gently humorous, and, at 81, still watching the changing world around him.

Despite his unassuming manner, Woodward is a towering figure in American historical scholarship. His achievements continue to influence his fellow historians and the Yale community. "He was and still is the most distinguished United States historian," said Professor Emeritus of History Edmund Morgan, an expert on colonial America. A scholar of the American South, Woodward won the Pulitzer Prize for his book Mary Chesnut's Civil War. Martin Luther King, Jr. referred to Woodward's Strange Career of Jim Crow, a history of segregation in America, as the Bible of the civil rights movement.

Woodward still spends his time these days writing, a pursuit he has enjoyed all his life. Recently, he published a new book of collected essays and speeches, The Future of the Past, and an article on segregation for the 75th anniversary issue of The New Republic. Although he is at his desk every day, Woodward hesitates to call his activities work. "Work is a curious definition," he said. "I do what I want to do. If that's work, I do a lot of it."

As a young man, Woodward wanted to be a writer, not a historian. He took one history class at Emory, and found it "boring." Upon graduating in 1930, he taught English for a year until the depression forced him out of the job. "I decided this might be the time to see if I could write," he said. He began a biography of Tom Watson, one of the first white politicians to appeal directly for black votes. When he ran out of money, Woodward entered graduate school at the University of North Carolina on a full scholarship, and completed the book in 1937 as his doctoral thesis. Tom Watson, Agrarian Rebel was published a year later, inaugurating Woodward's distinguished career.


His scholarly reputation notwithstanding, most Yale students today associate Woodward's name with the University's free-expression policies. The Woodward Committee established the first guidelines on free speech at Yale in 1974. Issues such as the Vietnam War and racial injustice dominated the campus when his committee convened, Woodward said. "There was very little dissent from the prevailing point of view on these issues," he said, adding that he, too, opposed the war. In 1972, boisterous crowds prevented General William Westmoreland and Secretary of State William Rogers from addressing the Yale Political Union. Two years later, under pressure from campus groups, the Union rescinded an invitation to William Shockley, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist who believed that blacks were genetically inferior to whites.

A group named Young Americans for Freedom then invited Shockley to debate William Rusher of The National Review, but a shouting crowd of protesters prevented the debate.

Woodward said he saw the Shockley incident as "an outrageous violation of free speech." He and the other professors who witnessed it went directly to President Kingman Brewster's house afterward to recount what they had seen. A few days later, Brewster established the Woodward Committee. The committee concluded that free speech is essential to the University's function and that Yale has an obligation to protect expression of views no matter how unpopular or distasteful. "The report ran contrary to the dominant opinion on the rights of free speech," Woodward said.

The customary definition meant making advances toward women. Now they call it harassment if people say things they don't like.

In the fall of 1988, Yale President Benno Schmidt decided the time had come to review the Woodward report. Anti-apartheid shanties, controversial posters, and charges of harassment at Yale led Schmidt to appoint a new committee, chaired by Physics Professor Robert Adair. After a year of deliberation, the Adair Committee essentially upheld the Woodward report. It recommended no major changes in Yale's policies and refused to outline strict procedures for determining what students could express verbally, graphically or symbolically.

"I was delighted to see that the Adair Report supported the findings of my committee, and that it addressed problems that are never really settled," Woodward said. "You just have to keep on settling them because they take new forms every time. People don't like offensive opinions, and one solution is to forbid them. That doesn't comport with my notions of free speech."

Woodward points out that the fight over free speech has changed since his committee met. "Back then, it was the majority that was offended by a public speech-the overwhelming majority," he said. "Currently, I think it is minorities who are up in arms, and are offended by certain kinds of speech. They call it harassment, but they don't want to hear people say things they don't like to hear." Woodward represented Wayne Dick (DC '88) in an appeal before the Executive Committee, after Dick had been suspended for putting up posters satirizing Gay and Lesbian Awareness Days at Yale. Reversing its earlier decision, the Executive Committee held that Dick had a right to put up his posters, even though gay and lesbian students said they felt harassed.

Some people today define harassment too broadly, Woodward said. "The customary definition meant making advances towards women. Now, you can call it harassment if you annoy people. It means saying anything that seems offensive."

However, the professor said he supports vocal minority groups on campus. "They have a perfect right to express their opinions, but they don't have the right to keep others from expressing theirs."

Raised in the segregated South, Woodward saw firsthand the effects of racism, and he has been concerned with the issue ever since. "I didn't have to imagine segregation. I'd seen it." He still recalls his experience as a boy in the town of Marlton, Arkansas near the Arkansas River. One night, he witnessed a mob assembling to lynch a black man. "I saw them get in the mood to take a human life," he said.

Partly because of the influence of The Strange Career of Jim Crow, Woodward is considered one of the country's foremost authorities on segregation. The book, which sold nearly 700,000 copies, drew considerable attention when it was published, not long after the Supreme Court desegregated public schools. As the situation of blacks changed during and after the civil rights movement, Woodward revised the book twice, in 1965 and 1974. Professor Robin Winks uses Jim Crow in his seminar on race relations and freedom of speech, he insists that historians should not follow political or personal agendas in their work. Today, he said, "historians tend to be known for what good cause they're advancing. That offends me. It distorts and abuses the true purpose of history writing to demonstrate that the historian's job does not end when a book reaches the shelves. In later editions, Winks said, readers can see Woodward rethinking his ideas.


Although he hasn't touched Jim Crow in 15 years, Woodward continues to explore segregation. Despite gains in civil rights achieved during the 1950s and 1960s, the problem has not died, he said. "We solved one part of it, and found that another part is worse." In his article for The New Republic, "The Crisis of Caste," Woodward argues that the growth of an inner-city underclass in the last 20 years represents a new kind of segregation, which he terms "hypersegregation."

"Improvement at the upper end of the economic scale has been accompanied by decline at the lower end, where the great majority of the black population is located," he wrote. "This is race relations without any relations between races- almost total segregation." While white resistance to change has contributed to hypersegregation, Woodward said, other factors have contributed as well. "The so-called underclass has been trapped, and, ironically, it has been deprived of its natural leaders- people of ability, training and education-because the very victory of the civil rights movement emancipated them from segregation, and they got out," he said.

While Woodward offers candid opinions about issues such as race relations and freedom of speech, he insists that historians should not follow political or personal agendas in their work. Today, he said, "historians tend to be known for what good cause they're advancing. That offends me. It distorts and abuses the true purpose of history."

"The historian's role," Woodward said, "is to describe and to analyze and to set forth conclusions dispassionately, and not to serve political or ideological ends." He concedes that it is "impossible and unnatural" to eliminate all subjectivity when writing history. "The historian should make it plain when he is intruding opinion upon evidence," he said.


Woodward believes that good prose is integral to good history, and admires historians like Edward Gibbon and Francis Parkman for their writing as much as for their historical analysis. Few historians today pay attention to the craft of writing, he believes; the result is poorer history. "While historians are normally judged by what they write, they don't realize sufficiently that what they write is powerfully affected by how they write it," he said. "In my definition, good writing is clarity and precision, and is
