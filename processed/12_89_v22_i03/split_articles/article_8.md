Play Room 
Brandon sat behind a Mickey Mouse 
pop-up toy, gleefully selling Chinese, 
Italian and American food. His main 
customer, 
Seth Kugel (BR '92), 
returned to the store again and again, 
occasionally bringing his "wife"-
Brandon's sister. Each time, Seth doled 
out more play money from a stash in 
his pocket. 

The shopping spree took place in the 
basement of the New Haven Family 
Shelter on Sylvan Avenue, where a 
play group for homeless children .meets 
three times a week. On Mondays, 
mothers and a caseworker spend time 
with 
kids, 
and 
on 
Friday 
and Saturday afternoons Yale volun-
teers join the group. Together, the 
adults and children play imaginary 
games like "food shop," draw pictures, 
and make pinatas and holiday treats. 

Although the play group began two 
years ago, the shelter has not yet 
funded the program, and it remains 
largely unstructured. If the group can 
get more money, the volunteers plan to 
organize field trips to the Peabody 
Musuem and an ice-skating rink. 

The play group is one of many 
services provided by Christian 
Community Action through the New 
Haven Family Shelter. At the shelter, 
CCA supports homeless families for 60 
to 90 days and tries to find them 
permanent housing. Children out-
number adults at the shelter by three 
to one. Although CCA has always 
directed them into the school system, 
the shelter provided no activities to fill 
up the childrens' free time until the 
play group 
started. 

When Sofie 
Turner, a case worker, began working 
in the shelter, she noticed that the kids 
made little social contact with each 
other. "They'd meet up and say hi, and 
start fighting or running in the halls," 
she said. Turner decided to open up 
the activities room in the basement for 
the kids. 

She soon had mothers bringing their 
children to the basement room twice a 
6 The New Journal/December 1, 1989 
week for the first sessions of the play 
group. Turner hoped to encourage 
responsible parenting in addition to 
entertaining the kids. Problems arose 
early on. One mother bragged con-
stantly about her son, but when he 
could not stay within the lines in his 
coloring books, she slapped him. 

Turner tried to reduce conflict by 
matching mothers with other women's 
children during the play group. She 
established some ground rules: Both 
children and parents must avoid 
physical abuse, 
name-calling, 
disrespectful 
terms. Turner also 
discouraged violent play, prohibiting 
toy guns and war games. 

Practical problems inhibited the 
Â·success of the program at first. When 
the mothers began bringing in their 
preschoolers, the group grew too large. 
"It's impossible to do a quality group 
with 15 to 25 kids, especially with kids 
as diverse as these," Turner said. "On 
good days, there were enough mothers 
so that we could split up into general 
age groups, but it takes a special kind 
of mother to do that." 

Early in September, Carlisle Levine 
(T D '91) gave Turner a call. Levine 
wanted to work with the kids in the 
shelter, and Turner saw a chance tp get 
her play group off the ground. Levine 
had worked with homeless adults 
before, but found it frustrating. "There 
was such a barrier that it was hard to 
feel I was making a difference," she 
said. Last summer she took a job as a 
waterfront counselor in a camp for 
homeless children. "They have love 
and care to give beyond any concep-
tion measurable," Levine said of the 
campers. She returned to New Haven 
determined to continue working with 
them. Turner, glad to take advantage 
of Levine's enthusiasm, invited her to 
come to the shelter. 

The play group overwhelmed 
Levine when she began visiting the 
Sylvan Avenue building alone. Turner 
suggested she put up some posters 
around Yale to find other students who 
might help at the shelter. Soon Levine 
assembled a group of 19 volunteers. 
They started to attend the play 
sessions, now called "Kids' Group," in 
October. Yet Levine found that in her 
new group she could not offer the 
volunteers concrete assignments. "In 
groups that have been around a while 
you come in and they can say, 'OK, 
here are the kids you'll be working 
with.' I couldn't do that because we 
were still figuring out what to do." 

Occasionally, more volunteers than 
children come to the group. Since 
attendance is irregular, volunteers do 
not know how many kids to expect, 
and they often must improvise 
activities. Levine and Turner hope 
that attendance will stabilize when the 
program becomes a routine in the 
shelter. Meanwhile, Turner is pleased. 
"I chip away. I know it's a big stone, 
and I only have a small hatchet. But I 
know I'm still making a difference," she 
said. The student volun teers say they 
are having a good time. Where else can 
a Yalie go to buy imaginary food with 
Monopoly money?
