a matter of personal p reference, devoid 
of m oral 
implications, 
and for 
cultivating mediocre teachers who, 
unable to command 
respec~, invite 
d isdain for intellectual authority. 
Silber advocates teaching ethics at 
an early age, asserting that schools 
should "support the principles and 
values we learn from sound families, 
from religion, and from the best 
examples in the society around us." 
Silber himself made the jump from 
studying theology at Yale Divinity 
School to studying Kantian ethics in 
the philosophy department, but in 
Straight Shooting he ultimately convinces 
neither himself nor the reader that 
schools can take the place of churches 
and families in teaching values. 
"Religious principles and values are 
... helpful," he writes, "though it is 
not the province of society or govern-
ment to provide them." Silber is still 
wrestling with the place of religious 
teachings in public education. 

Another point Silber has not worked 
out is free speech in the university. At 
fU"st he aligns himself with Milton, 
Mill and defenders of the right to 
dissent. "The stron gest support for all 
freedoms," he writes, "is the historical 
fact that for mankin d open controversy 
between different po ints of view is far 
better than the u ncontested presen-
tation of only one." H e 
invokes 
Socrates, J esus C h rist, Galileo and 
Billy Mitchell as victims of society's 
intolerance. Universities, Silber says, 
have a special obligation to protect 
dissenters and encourage the exchange 
of opinions. "The moral safeguard of 
individual 
self-expression 
is 
academic freedom and the courage of 
free individuals," he writes. 

Silber goes on, however, to narrow 
his definition of academic freedom to 
include "the obligation to speak and act 
. . . with reasonable taste, accuracy 
and fairness." Silber says that a 
professor who gives all his students A's 
should 
be fired 
for violating the 
principles of honesty on which a 
university rests. In addition , depart-
ments should not grant tenu re as 
readily as they do. Now, Silber says, 
"tenure functions as sinecure,"


encouraging faculty to abuse their 
academic freedom and to neglect the 
university's search for truth. 

Silber also attacks professors who he 
says spread misinformation. But it 
turns out that he wants to proscribe 
more than just the· historian who 
claims the Holocaust never happened. 
In a chapter called "Poisoning the 
Wells of Academe;" he attacks leftist 
linguist Noam Chomsky for saying: 
"Three times in a g~neration, America 
has 
laid waste ' ii. 
helpless Asian 
country." Silber counters that Japan 
was certainly not helpless in World 
War II, and that the whole U.N. 
rushed to defend South Korea in 1950. 
Silber does not let the matter rest as a 
difference of interpretation, however. 
He reviles Chomsky as an outright 
liar, 
a 
"well-poisoner," and a 
pernicious influence on the academy. 
Like any crusader, Silber sees his own 
opinions as fact. 

Silber's campaign for academic 
freedom admits many other contra-
dictions. He prefers controversy to 
monolithic truth, but has nothing but 
IICOrn for campus activists. He calls 
free expression the first principle of a 
university, but traces the decline of 
higher education in America to the 
Free Speech movement at Berkeley in 
1964. 
He condemns the 
radical 
philosopher Herbert Marcuse for 
advocating tolerance of leftwing views 
but not of rightwing views, yet he 
himself does just the reverse. Finally, 
be argues for a distinction between 
freedom to express an opinion and 
freedom to distort the truth; but he has 
no patience for those who wish to keep 
teachers of racial eugenics out of the


classroom. If William Shockley 
deserves a pulpit, so does Noam 
Chomsky. 

In addition to berating Chomsky, 
Silber brings up his longstanding 
dispute with Howard Zinn, a liberal 
historian at B. U. whose salary Silber 
has frozen. Silber cl;lastises Zinn for 
arguing with his interpretation of Martin 
Luther King's views. Zinn says that King 
went to jail not out of respect for the 
law, but to win popular support. Silber 
responds in Straight Shooting 
b'y 
c.alling the historian a well-poison-
er for "shamelessly distorting 
and degrading King's ethical position." 
By using his book to score points in 
these personal arguments, Silber 
detracts from his persuasiveness. 
He calls pass/fail 
grading an attempt by 
the m iddle class to 
save itself from 
downward mobility. 

A large part of Straight Shooting 
considers popular political questions 
such as abortion, poverty and foreign 
policy. On these matters Silber is not 
so much unpersuasive as simply out of 
his milieu; the chapters read like 
intelligent but amateur position 
papers. Although Silber denies that he 
aspires to hold public office, one 
cannot help suspecting that the last 
hundred pages of Straight Shooting 
constitute an effort to stake out 
political ground. 

On Central America, Silber extra-
polates from the Cuban Missile Crisis 
to 
what he calls 
the "Kennedy 
Doctrine," a policy which would rid the 
Western Hemisphere of Communism 
in places such as Nicaragua. Here 
Silber fails to differentiate between the 
threat of the Ortega government and 
that of Soviet missiles 9o mile~ from 
our shores; he m isconstrues hist'ory in 
the service of a political view, the same 
crime of which he accused Chomsky. 

On abortion, Silber challenges the 
argument that a woman should not 
have to go through pregnancy and 
childbirth because of the toll it will take 
on her. "If a woman can justify the 
termination of a pregnancy following 
voluntary coition, the same line of 
reasoning can be used by healthy and 
able-bodied men to justify abandoning 
wife and children and refusing to pay 
child support," he writes. "In either 
case, personal convenience and com-
fort replace moral responsibility." In 
other words, Silber equates a man's 
responsibility to support a 
child 
financially with a woman's obligation 
to bear the. child. 

In sum, Silber's proposals are a 
mixed lot. Some sound like good ideas, 
such as looking beyond schools of 
education to certify public-school 
teachers. Others seem bizarre, such as 
reviewing all federal regulations every 
ten years for renewal. Still others are 
downright wrongheaded, such as with· 
hold ing welfare checks from first-time 
teenage mothers so as to discourage 
promiscuity. 

Ultimately, Silber weakens his own 
cause by lapsing into generalizations 
and diatribes. Campus activists he calls 
wouid-be tyrants. Pass/fail grading he 
calls an attempt by the middle class to 
save itself from downward mobility. 
He condemns the feminist text Our 
Bodies> 
Ourselves as "rubbish." In 
moments like these Silber speaks with a 
spiteful, imperious tone, as though 
dismissing those who do not agree with 
him will solve America's problems. His 
readers should remember, as Silber 
himself would warn them, to be warY 
of those who claim to have all the 
answers.
