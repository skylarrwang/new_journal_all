But history as an academic dis-
cipline 
seems 
to 
be losing its 
attractiveness for college students. 

From 1971 to 1986 the number of his-
tory degrees awarded in the United 
States decreased from about 46,000 to 
16,000. 

This 
trend 
bothers 
Woodward. In the 1960s, he said, 
students began to feel disconnected 
from the past. H e thinks students have 
turned to other 
fields, 
including 
political 
science, 
sociology and 
psychology, because they believe these 
disciplines are better suited to "solving 
problems now." Woodward looks 
askance at those fields. History shows 
that troubling questions frequently 
persist, and that solutions can lead to 
new problems. The historian may not 
be able to solve those problems, 
Woodward said, but history does 
Provide perspective. "The historian's 
role is to keep the present in touch with 
the past."
