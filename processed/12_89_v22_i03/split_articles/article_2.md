War Rages at Local Paper
The feisty New Haven Independent burst onto the scene in 1986, giving a voice to 
the city's neighborhoods. But this year a clash between idealistic editors and a frustrated 
business department sent one writer to the hospital and the rest of the staff out on the 
pavement. By Roy Tsao.
