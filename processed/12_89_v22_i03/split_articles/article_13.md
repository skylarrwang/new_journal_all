EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Every drop of water we drink starts at 
the Lake Gaillard Reservoir, northeast of New Haven. 
sliding your tray along the serving line 
rails in the dining hall, you jostle for a 
pl.ilce at the beverage machines. You 
pause for a moment in front of the soft 
drinks and Hi-C, and then shove your 
glass under the water spout. Untainted 
by caffeine, chemical coloring 
or 
artificial sweetners, clear water gushes 
out: Before it spurts through the 
faucets at Yale, 
each drop has 
journeyed five days from a reservoir 
northeast of New Haven, through a 
network of underground pipes. A 
treatment plant at the Lake Galliard 
Reservoir strains out dead leaves, 
bacteria, and other plant and animal 
matter. But while it looks pure, by the 
time it reaches your glass, New Haven's 
drinking water has picked up tiny bits of 
metal and other contaminants. 

Yale students and New Haven 
residents often complain that their 
water tastes bad. Chlorine added to kill 
bacteria gives the water a chemical 
flavor, and copper piping accounts for 
the water's metallic tang. Yet our taste 
buds can't detect the most dangerous 
elements in the water we drink. "Water 
is a real scandal that hasn't been . 
discussed," said Matt Borenstein, the 
New Haven Green Party's mayoral 
candidate and a longtime city activist. 
"At least we should know what the risks 
are." Drinking water may contain any 
of nearly 1000 pollutants identified by 
the Environmental Protection Agency. 
The local Water Authority, a public 
corporation that channels water to 
nearly 400,000 southern Connecticut 
residents, notifies consumers through 
their monthly bills when pollution 
levels get too high. 

Many New Haveners remember the 
crisis of 1984, when an outbreak of 
fecal coliform bacteria hit the city's 
water supply. In an effort to kill the 
bacteria, the Water Authority poured 
almost three times the normal level of 
chlorine into the Lake Gaillard storage 
tanks. The result was something that 
tasted like swimming pool water. In 
August 1988, bacteria levels almost 
violated federal standards again and, 
according to Allen Hess, chief engi· 
neer at the Authority, a resident 
coliform population still lurks in the 
system. There is no way to prevent 
another outbreak, he said. "It could 
happen again at any time." 

Since chlorine dissipates as water 
flows to kitchen sinks across Con-
necticut, the Authority must add 
higher concentrations to keep the 
water bacteria-free until it reaches its 
farthest destination. But even this 
precaution, it turns out, poses a health 
risk. "You can't water your plants with 
it," said Borenstein. "It's not good for 
the fish. How long do you want to 
drink swimming pool water?" Many 
experts in charge of water quality insist 
that chlorine does not threaten public 
health. Neither the EPA nor the Water 
Authority sets maximum chlorine 
levels. "Chlorine poses no health risk, 
though it might not taste too good," 
said Peter Karalekas, chief of drinking 
water for the EPA in New England. 
Tom Jackson, a spoke_sman for the 
Water Authority, agrees: "It's never a 
health problem, it's just a matter of 
taste." 

But in 1987, a major study by the 
National Cancer Institute found that 
the risk of developing bladder cancer 
increased with 
the amount of 
chlorinated water consumed. The in-
cidence of bladder cancer, the fifth 
most common cancer in the U.S., has 
increased by 50 percent in the last 40 
years. Yet the Water Authority's con-
sumer brochures do not mention the 
carcinogenic effects of chlorine. 

Private customers like Yale can do 
nothing about the chlorine that the 
Water Authority dumps into our 
water, but the University could do 
more to get rid of lead- the most 
dangerous contaminant we drink. 

While the Authority oversees every 
drop that travels from Lake Gaillard 
Reservoir to New Haven's water 
mains, once water leaves a shut-off box 
at the curb the Authority's job is over. 
A lot can happen between the street 
and the kitchen tap. In many areas, 
including Yale, lead leaches in.to 
drinking water through indoor 
plumbing. Although the EPA banned 
all lead materials in public water 
systems in 1986, most old buildings 
still contain antiquated lead pipes. 

Lead contamination deadens the 
central nervous system and causes 
kidney breakdown, loss of motor 
coordination, fetal disorders, and 
miscarriages. 

According to data 
collected by the EPA, 42 million 
Americans and 240,000 children have 
suffered reduced intellectual capacity 
because of lead in drinking water. The 
EPA has found that even levels below 
the current maximum contaminant level 
(MCL) for lead of 50 parts per billion 
(ppb) are enough to cause serious 
health defects. In Connecticut, public 
officials worry that lead damages 
unknown numbers of local residents. 
"Children are playing in and 
drinking water that may be con-
taminated with lead," said Frederick 
Adams, state health services 
commissioner. This year, 
the 
Connecticut Health Commission 
designated June as Lead Poisoning 
Prevention Awareness Month. The 
Water Authority sent out a brochure 
entitled Get the Leod Out to 100,000 
customers in its service area, warning 
them, among other tips, not to cook 
with hot water because higher temper· 
atures speed up leaching. The 
Authority also tries to prevent leaching 
by lacing its tanks with sodium 
hydroxide, a chemical which mellows 
water to a basic pH level, so it does not 
corrode pipes. Still, 
the Water 
Authority concedes that lead levels in 
New Haven's drinking water may be 
dangerously high. 

"Everyone in New Haven who can 
afford it buys bottled water,,. said 
Borenstein. As part of his mayoral


platform this fall, Borenstein proposed 
raising water rates, taxing Yale to fund 
improvements in the quality of the 
water system, and launching a public 
education campaign. Dale Abbott, a 
New Haven plumber for the last 25 
years, also said the government is not 
doing enough. Abbott, who sells a 
water purification system recently 
installed in the Boston Public Schools, 
sent a letter to all the New Haven 
papers last month, chastising the 
Water Authority for neglecting to 
educate the public about the dangers of 
lead. "It's as good as selling drugs to 
kids," he said. 

This year the New Haven Advocate 
tested 20 local buildings for leaded 
drinking water. One fourth of their 
samples showed lead levels above the 
EPA's proposed maximum limit 
of 
ten 
ppb. 
Spring 
Glen 
School in Harnden came up with a 
startling 70ppb by the Advocates 
measurements. Since the test results 
were published, schoolchildren in 
Hamden and New Haven have joined 
the Water Authority's effort to make 
their water safe to drink. Under the 
Authority's Water Ranger program, 
each school appoints student Rangers 
to run drinking fountains for several 
minutes every morning, washing out 
any lead that seeped in overnight. The 
Water Authority began the program 
last spring by inviting principals at 
each of the 182 public and private 
schools in its area . to participate. 

According to Rosemary Macionus, 
education director for the Water 
Authority, 76 of the 182 schools in the 
Authority's service area have joined so 
far. More than half of New Haven's 55 
schools have decided to appoint 
student Rangers. 

Yale has yet to introduce anything 
like a team of college Water Rangers.
