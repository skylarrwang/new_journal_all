LOCAL PAPER 
The Octob~;- 19 issue of the New Haven 
Independent was, by all accounts, a 
pitiful sheaf of newsprint. Peculiarly 
large photographs floated among awk-
ward patches of white space. No hint of 
the city's most watched election in 
decades appeared 
in the political 
weekly. A letter to the editor published 
two 
weeks 
later 
lamented, 
"It's 
alarming and depressing how rapidly 
the paper has gone downhill . . . It is 
really pathetic." A clever reader might 
have detected the irony behind the lead 
photograph, which showed striking 
office workers walking off their jobs. 
The entire eight-member editorial staff 
of the Independent had quit that week. 
The shoddy October 19 edition and 
the accompanying mass exodus were 
not the worst of the debacle that week. 
Shortly after the editorial staff 
dispersed from posing for a farewell 
photo on the front steps, paramedics 
rushed into the office to carry the 
paper's associate editor, 
Margaret 
Spillane, to the hospital. Police arrived 
to arrest 
the 
marketing director, 
Bernard Zelitch, who Spillane claimed 
had attacked her. Accounts of the fight 
vary among the staff. "The next thing I 
saw was Margaret flying out of the 
office with a tremendous crash," said _ 
Bruce Shapiro, the former executive 
editor. "It brought people up from 
downstairs. She was flat on her back, 
very dazed." Zelitch said he never hit 
Spillane. All sides agreed that the 
argument started when the two began 
bickering over who had the right to 
open a piece of office mail. Clearly, the ' 
work environment had deteriorated. It 
was no secret that the writers and • 
editors quit because they were angry 
with Zelitch and his wife Caroline
