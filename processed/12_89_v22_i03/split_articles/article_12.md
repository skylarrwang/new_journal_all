stayed 
true to 
its m1ss1on. 

The 
remaining founders kept insisting that 
all they needed was more time. 

When the editors asked for another 
$350,000 this year, H enley-Cohn 
decided she'd had enough. In June, she 
found 
a 
new 
h usband-and-wife 
newspaper team to take over as 
publisher and marketing director. 

Caroline Cole and Bernard Zelitch 
shared her bottom-line management 
philosophy. "The commune just wasn't 
working," Cole said. "There was no 
monitoring, responsibility, or accoun t-
ability." The new publisher set out to 
install a corporate hierarchy. She 
abolished the egalitarian pay system, 
nearly doublin~ her own salary in the 
process, and prepared to rid the 
company of the inefficiency she saw 
in ·everything from production sche-
dules to office design. The Basses quit 
on July 7, the day after the new team 
started work. "Caroline Cole told me 
she hated my paper," said Paul Bass. 
"She said she wanted to take me off 
politics to cover high school track 
meets." 

Of the newspaper's founders, only 
Bruce Shapiro remained for the absurd 
last act of the lndependmt drama. The 
events leading up to the October 
walkout became a caricature of the 
struggle between journalistic idealism 
and corporate efficiency. "As time 
went on, Cole became more and more 
like Lady Macbeth," Shapiro said, 
"more and more concerned with 
moving furniture and punching time 
clocks. It was like rearranging the deck 
chairs on the Titanic." The new 
publisher carried out her plans with 
"an abrupt, verbally abusive, and 
authoritarian personal style," he said. 
"It went from being the best work 
environment I've ever been in to the 
worst." 

Cole objects to the idea that she 
should have asked the staffs permis-
sion before rearranging furniture to 
create a more efficient, less communal 
office space. "There were just as many 
people, probably more, who felt more 
comfortable in a 
traditional hier-
archical structure," she said. 

Furthermore, Cole said Shapiro and 
his staff were carrying out a personal 
vendetta against her by slacking off 
and missing deadlines. "Certain people 
were putting in a lot of effort to 
sabotage the paper," she said. "The 
staff held a mass meeting to think of 
ways 
to 
send 
us 
back 
Massachusetts." 

As the discord in the office got 
worse, so did the quality of the paper. 
Reporters at the RegisttT stopped 
clfecking their own stories on 
Thursdays against the latest edition of 
the Independent. "They're not out in the 
neighborhoods anymQre," said Paul 
Bass from his new office at the Advocate. 

One change came as a surprise even to 
Shapiro. "I picked up a copy of the 
paper one week when it came back 
from the printer,~ he said. "I opened it 
up, and there was this puzzle." Cole 
and Zelitch had ordered a series of 
weekly puzzles from a national syndi-
cate. "This sum is the largest dollar 
amount a contestant can win in a 
standard game of Jeopardy!" one of 
them teased. Shapiro was incensed. "In 
the first place, it was a dumb puzzle. 
But more important, it was syndicated, 
which went entirely 
against our 
mission." 

Cole said she ordered the puzzle as a 
last resort, because Shapiro and the 
editorial staff were not generating 
enough copy to fill the 24 pages 
mandated by the Postal Service. "It 
was a promotional item- one that 
happened to be wildly successful," she 
said. In any case, the paper's com-
munitarian ideal had fallen by the 
wayside. The Independent had joined the 
city's other papers in relying on 
syndicated material and neglecting 
local news. "The paper has deter-
iorated into a collection of safe, bland 
descriptions," one reader wrote in. It 
looked more and more like the Register, 
only thinner- anq was losing more 
money than ever before. 

Shapiro made one last attempt to 
regain control of the paper. He typed 


up a plan and gave it to Henley-Cohn, 
calling for a 
total reorganization, 
wh ich included getting rid of Cole and 
Zelitch. H enley-Cohn rejected it. "I 
didn't want Bruce in charge," she said. 

In mid-October the frustrated editorial 
staff resigned. After the fracas between 
Zelitch and Spillane, th e majority 
own er ordered the Independent office 
locks changed, allowing only Cole and 
the production staff inside to slap 
together the infamous October 19 
issue. By the end of the week Henley-
Cohn accepted resignations from Cole 
and 
Zelitch · as well, "to make a 
completely fresh start." 

"I don't want to run a 
cutesy, nicey 
newspaper, because 
readers aren't stupid." 

Despite its inglorious demise, the 
brand of community journalism ori-
ginated at the Independent has leaked 
into the other local papers. Since Paul 
Bass signed on as a staff reporter, the 
Advocate has begun to fill out its pages 
with more investigative stories, most of 
which Bass writes himself. (In one 
recent issue, a column by Bass on labor 
relations in the New Haven schools ran 
twice, under two different headlines.) 

Still, with its large regional audience 
and upscale tone, the paper makes no 
pretense of being a smalltown commu-
nity weekly like the original Inde-
/Hndent. Its recent "Au tumn T imes" 
issue gave about three pages to local 
news and nearly nine to "Living a Lie," 
tongue-in-cheek look at 
New 
England fall traditions that could have 
run in New York's Spy magazine. 

The Registers urban coverage has 
also changed since the Independent 
appeared. The daily recently looked 
closely at issues of poverty, drugs and 
racism in its two series titled "New 
Haven's Ten Worst Problems" and "A 
City Divided." And 
it surprised 
everyone with its endorsement of John 
Daniels for mayor. Thomas Geyer, the 
Registers CEO and former editor, praised 
the !ndependmfs savvy. "The Independent 
provided a clear perspective on things 
we didn't always report on," he said, 
"with a strong point of view that was 
always thought-provoking." Nonethe-
less, the Register looks more like USA 
Today than the old Independent, and 
typically leans on light features sent 
over the Associated Press wires. So far, 
no New Haven newspaper has filled 
the gap in local reporting left by the 
Independent. 

Paul Bass and Henley-Cohn agreed 
that the responsibility for their paper's 
failures belongs to everyone . "I accept 
my share of the blame," H enley-Cohn 
said. I should have made it run on its 
revenues a long time ago." The timing 
was wrong, the market was tight. "I 
was not a strong CEO, I didn't make 
the tough decisions," Bass conceded. 

But the two disagree about whether a 
newspaper built on the idealistic model 
of the P.C .B.C. collective could ever 
survive in New Haven, even in the 
best financial climate. 

Another local journalist, 
Carol 
Leonetti Dannhauser, took over as 
editor of the Independent on November 
15. Although it will run with a more 
traditional business structure, and far 
tighter budgets, Leonetti said the spirit 
of the original founders will return to 
the pages of the new Independent. "I 
don't want to run a cutesy, nicey 
newspaper, 
because readers aren't 
stupid," she said. "I'm certainly not 
going to keep my mouth shut."
