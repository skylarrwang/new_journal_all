Silber's Solution 
Straight Shooting: What's Wrong with 
America and How to Fix It, by John 
Silber, Harper & Row Publishers (New 
York: 1989) 122. 50, 336 pages. 

From the man who brought us faculty 
union-busting and the resurrection of 
parietal rules comes a new treatise that 
traces our nation's problems to the 
failures of our educational system. 

Modestly titled Straight Shooting: What~ 
Wrong with Amenea and How to Fix It, 
this work by Boston University Presi-
dent J ohn Silber offers a polemical 
prescription for curing the country's 
ills. 

Following the trail of Allan Bloom, 
William Bennett and other conser-
26 The New JoumaVDecember I, 1989 
vative gurus of higher education, 
Silber, 
who studied at the Yale 
Divinity School and earned his Ph.D . 
in philosophy here, is treading a well-
beaten path. Silber, however, has a 
broader agenda than his predecessors. 
He tackles not only America's 
intellectual and moral decline, but also 
the problems of Central American 
policy, the U.S. legal system, and 
pass/fail grading. Silber quotes freely 
from Shakespeare and Shaw, Kant and 
Kierkegaard; he points a finger at 
television and sexual promiscuity; and 
he recommends new programs to find 
better teachers and to lower rates of 
teenage pregnancy. The book's 
shotgun attack on a huge range of 
problems comes as no surprise to those 
familiar with Silber's controversial 
reign at Boston University. 

Last year Silber forbade B. U. 
students from hosting overnight guests 
of the opposite sex, explaining to 
outraged undergraduates, "Mr. and 
Mrs. America are sick and tired of 
institutionalized degeneracy." Indeed, 
since he became president of B.U. in 
1970, the pugnacious administrator 
has battled liberal students and 
professors. Twice his faculty has voted 
to dismiss him. In 1976 several 
hundred professors and ten of the 
university's 15 deans signed a petition 
to have him fired. In 1979, professors 
went on strike, complaining that while 

their salaries had grown by only two 
percent a year under Silber, his own 
had soared to $288,000, the highest of 
any university president. 

. In one chapter of Straight Shooting 
Silber rails against what he calls "The 
Litigious Society" and deplores the 
nation's growing tendency to solve 
Problems through the legal system. 
Perhaps this is because he has so often 
found himself in court. In 1985 a B.U. 
Student, with the American Civil 
Liberties Union by his side, suc-
cessfully sued Silber's administration 
for the right to hang a banner that read 
"Divest!" from his dormitory window. 
Two years later, the university lost a 
sex discrimination suit, and had to 
"Mr. and Mrs. 
America are sick and 
tired of 
institutionalized 
degeneracy." 
reinstate an English professor whom it 
had denied tenure. The ad ministration 
finally enjoyed a victory last year, 
when a court of appeals ruled that the 
B. U. faculty could not legally form a 
union. 

Although Silber often seems hostile 
to the interests of his. university, in 
Straight Shooting he appears sincerely 
committed to education. Unlike most 
Reagan-era conservatives, he criticizes 
cutbacks in student financial aid. 
Overwhelming debt forces graduates 
to default on their loans, Silber writes, 
and even leads to moral decay. "They 
become morally no less than finan-
cially bankrupt. By encouraging loan 
programs that foster this irrespon-
sibility, American higher education 
subverts its essential purpose." 

In his chapter on the high costs of 
tuition, Silber shows his faith that 
schools can fix America. "Education , 
understood in its broadest sense, is the 
enduring bridge to social improve-
ment," he writes. "T he social programs 
we have tried have failed because we 
have ignored this essential insight." 

Crime, 
drugs, 
AIDS, 
unemploy-
ment- all these blights of modern 
society grow out of a failed educational 
.system, Silber says. Silber attacks the 
elementary and secondary 
school 
system for offering bilingual education 
that discou rages students from 
learning English, for presenting sex as
