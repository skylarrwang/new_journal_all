EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
To the Editor, 
It appears that Theroux has failed to 
make an important distinction: the 
is/ought or descriptive/normative 
distinction. Such a distinction must be 
taken into consideration when asses-
sing Dr. 
Poussaint's emphasis on 
isolating the factor of "anger" in 
~eference to the Central Park "rape" 
ISSUe. 

By isolating as essential the ques-
tion "Why these [black] kids were 
angry," it is clear that Dr. Poussaint is 
working with the Freudian presupposi-
tion that what we observe as an overt 
behavioral pattern (in this case "rape" 
or "mugging") may very well result 
from 
some hidden (unconscious) 
variable. 

Now, by appealing to this type of 
descriptive theoretical explanation, 
Dr. 
Poussaint is not trying to 
vindicate the 
perpetrators of 
their pernicious and moraily inept act. 
That is, it is important to separate the 
descriptive explanatory function of 
"anger" as used by Dr. Poussaint from 
a normative judgment. It is by blur-
ring such a distinction that Prof. 
Theroux draws the erroneous implica-
tion that Dr. Poussaint is attempting to 
covertly exempt the perpetrators from 
blame. 

Now concerning Theroux's usage of 
a certain term. As a scholar of Letters, 
he should have been more tactful, to 
say the least, in his selection of the 
word "monkeys" to describe the black 
men who "raped" the jogger. Yes, we 
as Afro-Americans 
are throwing a 
"shit-fit," to use Theroux's turn of 
phrase, for "monkey" suggests sub-
rational and sub-human themes. 
Theroux, of all people, should have 
known that during the 1600s (among 
Englishmen, Elizabethan travelers and 
literati) Africans were equated with 
monkeys to sustain the inner-logic 
"justifying" the view that they were 
uncivilized, irrational and lascivious 
people. Hence, to use the word within 
the context of describing the black men 
who "raped" the jogger tends to invoke 
(even if Theroux did not intend the 
word to do so) the false and racist 
image that Africans and AfrC?-Ameri-
4 The New Journal/December I, 1989 
cans are by nature 
monkey-like 
creatures, bestial and wanton. Given 
the stigmatic historical association of 
the word with Africans in the past, it is 
difficult to excuse Theroux's lack of 
awareness concerning the social, 
psycho-linguist_ic import that 
the word has for Afro-Americans 
today. 

Perhaps more of Theroux's surface-
grammar needs to 
be closely 
psychoanalyzed.

I read with a resigned sense of dismay 
your article "Poison Pen: A Yale 
English Professor Writes up a Storm of 
Controversy" (TNJ, October 20, 1989) 
for 
it 
reveals 
the 
common 
misunderstanding which exists 
concerning the word "racism." 

When Professor Theroux makes the 
statement "[i]t's very interesting how 
racism always seems to be against 
whites," it indicates that he does not 
realize racism is an institutionalized 
system of oppression or subjugation 
used to maintain the power of one 
racial group over another racial group, 
which can be propagated through the 
words, actions or, indeed, inactions of 
an institution as well as through those 
individuals associated with that 
institution. Given the position of 
Blacks in America today vis-a-vis 
Whites, it would be a contradiction in 
terms to say that Blacks can be racist. 

Remarks such as those he made in 
his letter on Yale stationery to Dr. 
Poussaint concerning the Central Park 
rape incident, in which he refers to the 
Black and Brown suspects involved in 
case as 
being subhuman 
"monkeys," are not only bigoted but 
are raised to the level of racism by 
bearing what appears 
to be the 
imprimatur of an institution such as 
Yale University. Parenthetically, one 
wonders whether he would refer to the 
White attackers of Yusuf Hawkins in 
Bensonhurst, · Brooklyn as being 
"monkeys." 

· It is certain that the Central Park 
rape incident was a tragedy and that 
such acts of violence should not be 
condoned or excused. It is equally 
certain that reactions such as Professor 
Theroux's which bear the mark of 
racism, whether intentional or 
otherwise, should not be condoned or 
excused either.

The piece I found most interesting in 
your last issue was the one about Pro-
fessor Theroux and his peculiar letter. 
Somehow, I had missed this brouhaha. 
It raises so many important and com-
plicated issues- about racism, sexism, 
semantics, and free-speech rights. My 
own sense is that Theroux wrote a very 
dumb letter- but not nearly as dumb 
as the people demanding that he be 
fired for writing it. Since when does 
sheer stupidity (or, for that matter, 
malice) disqualify one from teaching at 
a great American university? I suspect, 
in fact, that these are often prere-
quisites for the work.
