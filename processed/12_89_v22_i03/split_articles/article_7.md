Model Building 
The black and silver plaque marking 
Cesar Pelli & Associates' Chapel Street 
office hides in the shadows of the 
doorway. Upstairs, ajumble of rooms, 
annexed one by one as the architec-
tural firm has expanded, 
spreads 
throughout three floors. Models of 
different sizes and colors overflow the 
table~ and shelves. Removable sky-
scraper caps cluster around one 
miniature building, like toy hats. 

This year, CP&A won the American 
Institute of Architects' award for ten 
years of nationally distinguished work. 
The firm's designs include the World 
Financial Center- in New York's Bat-
tery Park City as well as Canary Wharf 
in London, one,.;.of the largest real 
estate developin'ehts ever. CP&A is 
also working on several small projects 
nearby, 
landscaping the Jonathan 
Edwards College courtyard and instal-
ling lampposts around the Yale 
campus. 

In the early 1960s, Pelli worked as 
project designer on Morse and Stiles 
colleges with architect Eero Saarinen. 
After living in Los Angeles for 12 
years, he returned to Yale in 1977 to 
become dean of the School of Archi-
tecture. At the same time he founded 
his own firm with partners Diana 
Balmori and Fred Clarke. Instead of 
moving back to a large city like Los 
Angeles or New York, the partners 
decided to stay in New Haven when 
Pelli fmished his term as dean. The 
firm has been growing ever since. 

In 1987, CP&A landed a series of 
large commissions, including Canary 
Wharf, and their design staff expanded 
from about 35 to nearly 100. Pelli 
looked to the nearby pool of students to 
find talented part-time labor. Twelve 
Yale graduates have become Pelli 
associates. Half a 
dozen graduate 
students and 
two undergradu-
ates- Brian O'Looney (SM '90) and 
Robert Kim OE '90)-work at CP&A, 
Associates work side-by-side with students late into the night at Cesar 
Pelli's Chapel Street Office. 
alongside architects from as far away 
as California and Japan. 

Students say that the atmosphere in 
the CP&A office reminds them of the 
classroom studios in Yale's Art and 
Architecture building, where both Pelli 
and Balmori teach. The firm keeps 
hours similar to students' work 
schedules. "It's common for 20 or 25 
architects to be working at 9 or 9:30 
p.m.," said O'Looney. Several stu-
dents, 
including Tony 
Markese 
(ARCH '88) and Bill Vinyard (ARCH 
'88), who had their drafting tables side 
by side at Yale, have graduated to 
work together at Pelli's firm. "They 
were on a roll at school which just 
hasn't stopped," said Erika Belsey 
(ARCH '90). 

This same sense of community 
shows 
in the 
firm's 
collaborative 
approach to design. Unlike some big 
firms such as Skidmore, Owings & 
Merrill, Pelli's office does not divide 
work 
among bureaucratic depart-
ments. Instead, Pelli shares his ideas 
with design teams, which make models 
and meet with him to discuss projects 
every week. If they want, individual 
team members, whether undergradu-
ates or associates, can also offer their 
own designs. 

Last month, Pelli had a meeting to 
examine the miniature caps built by 
members of a skyscraper design team. 
He crouched down to place himself at 
eye-level with the entrance of the 
model building, while one team 
member tried the caps on the model 
one by one. After choosing a proposal, 
Pelli sent the team members back to 
work out a finished design. "The 
system is loose yet well-run," said 
O'Looney. "It offers us a chance to 
learn through participation." Learning 
modelmaking techniques also helps 
Â· students in their classes at Yale. 

Because Pelli relies on models instead 
of drawings, his assistants learn prac-
tical skills in addition to learning many 
aspects of design development. Belsey 
said that after an architect taught her 
to bevel an edge on a model she show-
ed the technique to her friends at 
school. 

CP&A will probably stay in New 
Haven and continue to train Yale ar-
chitecture students for years to come. 
Despite its success, CP&A's public 
relations director Charles Rosenbloom 
OE '87) said that the firm will not grow 
much more. "Because Cesar likes to 
maintain an involvement in every-
thing," he said, "the firm is about as big 
as it can be."
