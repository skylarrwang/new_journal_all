Early-July, 2006
O
ne summer when I was six years 
old, my parents packed us all into 
our scratched and dented black Mazda 
mpv and made the three hour drive up 
the Taconic to Hillsdale, New York. 
We were going to spend the month 
at my grandma’s old country house, a 
ramshackle structure of rotting wood 
and tacky shingles built on top of a 
cleared hilltop in the woods. By day, 
the house was full of magic. I wandered 
from room to room transfixed by the 
hummingbirds hovering to drink from 
my grandmother’s bird feeder, and the 
lines of ants that came at dinnertime 
to collect the crumbs dropped from 
my fork. But when darkness fell, the 
night cracked open with the howls of 
coyotes and toads and owls hoo-hooing 
in voices like the one my mom gave to 
Voldemort when she read to us before 
bed. Then ghosts overtook the house. 
They groaned through the pipes and 
banged around the boiler room and 
creaked over the ancient floorboards. I 
could see them out of the corner of my 
eye as I lay in bed, silhouettes slipping 
toward me across the dark carpet.

Nearly every night when I couldn’t 
fall asleep, I’d clamber upstairs as fast 
as I could and knock quietly on my 
parents’ bedroom door. My dad was 
always awake, sitting up with his read­
ing glasses perched on the tip of his 
nose, typing furiously on his computer. 
“Daddy,” I’d whisper, and he’d sigh 
and hoist himself out of bed and tramp 
behind me back down the stairs, just 
the way he did when I had nightmares 
at home. “I’ll sit here until you fall 
asleep,” he’d say and reopen his com­
puter. In that halo of white light the 
ghosts fled, sliding back into the walls 
where their sounds couldn’t hurt me. 
Sometimes I think I’ve been chasing 
that feeling my whole life, the warmth 
I felt in the safety of his light.


Mid-April, 2020
I 
wake up every day by the glare of 
the sun. The first thing I do in the 
morning is reach for my phone to check 
the time. It’s been getting later every 
week: 10:30, 10:45, 11:00, 11:15. A couple 
weeks ago I decided it was okay to miss 
my morning Art History lecture. We’re 
not getting graded, and when will I 
ever need to know about post-Impres­
sionist artists? People only care about 
the Impressionists anyway. Since then 
I’ve missed nearly every class. Instead, 
I watch YouTube videos until I can feel 
my bladder all the way down in my 
knees, and then I pad down the hall to 
the bathroom and hold a hand over my 
eyes to block the light while I consider 
whether it’s worth it today to put in my 
contact lenses. 

In the month I’ve been back home, 
news of the covid-19 pandemic has 
gotten worse. School has been canceled 
for at least the semester. I can count 
on one hand the number of people I’ve 
seen outside my family. The man at the 
deli who spreads cream cheese on my 
bagel. The guy with a nose ring who 
sells me weed. My neighbor, an elderly 
man with a pinched face and angry 
eyes who sits on his stoop all day feed­
ing treats to passing dogs. (“What’s a 
human gotta do to get one of those,” 
I called to him once, on the way back 
from the deli with a bagel. He didn’t 
respond.) I’ve thought about texting 
some friends to go on a walk, but when 
I scroll through my high school contact 
list—Ananda, Henry, Jane, Trish—I 
start to feel queasy and decide to do it 
later, when I’m feeling more up to it. 
It’s not that I don’t want to see them. 
It’s just that doing anything at all feels 
too much to ask of myself. 

My desk is a waiter’s tray of un-
washed coffee mugs, cups and plates, 
my clothes a heap on the carpet. My 
bedside table is stacked high with jour­
nals abandoned after the second page. 
I take Zoom classes with the laptop 
screen tilted up toward the wall, so 
people don’t see the mess. I’ve come 
to dread our nightly family dinners 
because my dad will ask me if I’ve been 
outside that day. “You should take a 
walk,” he’ll say. “It’ll do you good.” 
“You just don’t get it,” I’ll huff, and pick 
at my food.

When dinner is over and my par­
ents have gone upstairs, my brother, 
sister and I gather in the living room. 
Someone takes out a joint, a board 
game, or a bottle of wine, and for the 
night we’ll be three kids with every­
thing except someone to tell us no. My 
brother Noah is the musician, and he 
grabs the aux. “Mellow or wild,” he 
asks, and we laugh and go “mild”. My 
sister Ruby is the chef, and she sections 
out the cookie dough. “No, let’s have 
brownies this time,” I yell from the 
living room. “Make your own fucking 
brownies,” she calls back. The streets 
slowly empty of night-owl dads walk­
ing their dogs; the security guard with 
a Mets baseball cap comes by to lock 
the school playground. Deep into the 
night the three of us stay up, playing 
Settlers of Catan and watching Game 
of Thrones. Nights like these, I remem­
ber why I love this place so much, why 
I find it so hard to stay away. But then 
night oozes into morning, viscous like 
cheap syrup, and I feel the water empty 
down the drain again.

On the sidewalk outside our house, 
the cherry blossom tree is in full bloom. 
Sometimes I take my breakfast out onto 
the front stoop, watching petals spiral 
down to catch in my hair. There’s a little 
kid who likes to play down on the street 
with his action figures—the grandson 
of one of my neighbors. When the wind 
gets to gusting the tree spills a swirling 
ribbon of pink petals over the road, and 
the little boy goes chasing after them, 
trying to land one on his tongue. I 
watch him play sometimes, sipping my 
coffee. It’s almost too easy to switch 
places with him. If I close my eyes, I 
can feel the hot concrete on the soles of 
my shoes, and the way the sweet smell 
of spring fires up my bloodstream, and 
the bitter taste of those cotton-candy 
petals, dissolving on my tongue.


Early-November, 2018
’m sitting on a low stone bench in 
the Parco di Celio, overlooking the 
plaza and the sagging Colosseum lit 
up from within like a rotting jack o’ 
lantern. I’ve decided to take a year off

before college, enchanted by the idea of 
discovering myself by discovering the 
world – a project which a couple weeks 
ago seemed as simple as buying a plane 
ticket. Tomorrow, I take the train north 
from Termini Station into Tuscany, 
where I’ll spend the next couple of 
months at a vineyard, picking grapes. 
I can’t think about it without my heart 
lurching precariously against my rib­
cage. But for tonight I’m in Rome, 
slowly eating a slice of pizza purchased 
from the first place I came across with 
English signs, trying to take in the glit­
tering lights of the Colosseum without 
thinking about tomorrow.

On the way back to the hostel I hear 
the sinking, tinkling sound in my head­
phones that means my phone’s about to 
die—doo, doo, doo. I have no idea where 
I am, I’m using Google Maps to nav­
igate, but each time I look down the 
battery is lower. 5% . . . 4% . . . 3%. How 
could I be so stupid? I start to run, 
squeezing around couples strolling 
hand-in-hand through narrow alley­
ways. Everyone is young and together 
in this city. I turn a corner and almost 
run over a lady with her dog. She yells 
something in Italian, but I don’t notice 
because there at the end of the street is 
the door of my hostel. I reach it just as 
my phone screen turns black. 

My little room on the second floor 
is too dark to fall asleep. I try opening 
the curtains, but still the blackness is 
impenetrable and I can’t see my hand 
held out in front of my face. I reach 
over and turn on the flashlight on my 
charging phone, covering it partially 
in dirty clothes until the room glows 
softly with light.

The sounds drifting in through 
the open window are unfamiliar—the 
rattling of bicycle wheels over cobble­
stones and the strange inflections of 
foreign voices. I feel something hot and 
panicky rise up from my chest and stick 
in my throat, pushing up against the 
hollow beneath my Adam’s apple. How 
will I ever fall asleep like this? I close 
my eyes and picture what would’ve 
happened if my phone had died just a 
little earlier. Where would I have slept? 
Who would I have asked for help? Two 
months is such a long time to be away 
from home; everyone I need is too far 
away to help. They must all be asleep by 
now—out of reach.

Suddenly I sit up in bed. I’d for­
gotten about the time difference; it’s 
six hours earlier in New York. They’ll 
be at dinner, sitting together around 
the dining room table. I snatch my 
phone from beneath the pile of clothes 
and call my mom, forgetting to use 
FaceTime to avoid the long-distance 
charge. She picks up on the second 
ring. “Hi McLovin!” she says, a joke 
so old I forget how it started. “Mom,” 
I whisper, as the pressure of the black­
ness suddenly lifts away. “Will you just 
talk to me for a bit?”

Late-April, 2020
T
oday I think I’ll go for a walk. I 
pack some peanuts in a Ziploc 
bag, grab a Jonathan Franzen novel 
and head out the door. It’s a still, lazy 
time of day, and the air feels heavy with 
the smell of an approaching rain. I set 
off down 1st Street and take a right 
onto 6th Avenue. Every street is col­
ored with the emotional resonance of 
a memory. This corner is where I got 
bitten by my dog when he was still an 
untrained puppy, and here is the store 
where we get fresh matzah on Passover. 
I take a right on Sterling Street, pass 
the bench where I got drunk for the 
first time, another right onto 8th 
Avenue, stopping for a moment to take 
a sip of water at the synagogue where I 
had my bar mitzvah, dancing the horah 
with a girl I wanted to kiss. Another 
left onto Garfield Place, up the slope 
where I don’t go skateboarding any­
more because I’ve fallen too many 
times, into the park and through a little 
opening in the trees, where the leaves 
are damp and thick underfoot, where 
the air is just as restless as me. 

A little ways along a pond emerges, 
covered by a thick, green carpet of 
spring algae. I sit beside it on a damp 
log and take out the bag of peanuts, 
watching as the algae drifts back 
and forth over the water. A squirrel 
scampers down the trunk of a nearby 
tree and approaches me, his front leg 
extended as if reaching for something. 
He wants a peanut, I think. I toss a 
handful into the grass, but the squirrel 
ignores them. He’s staring at me, his 
head cocked. His eyes are black. We 
look at each other for a moment, and 
then I stomp my foot and he scurries 
back up the tree. 

A patch of opaque water opens 
up in the algae before me. I lean over 
and my reflection rises up to meet 
me. I sense the algae drifting across 
the pond, forward and back, and the 
trees swaying in the breeze, and for 
a moment I feel the ground beneath 
me fall away. The big wet log is gone, 
the trees and the grass and the algae 
blend together into a smear of green, 
and I feel as if I’m tipping forward into 
empty space, into the pond. I clutch the 
log for support but my head is spinning 
from the heat. It strikes me all of a sud­
den how bizarre it is that the reflection 
in the water should be mine – my nose, 
my hair, my shapeless, chapped lips. I 
step back from the edge into the shade 
of the tree and lie down on the grass, 
trying to steady myself. Above me, 
the squirrel rustling through slender 
branches dislodges an acorn. It lands 
with a plunk in the water and sinks 
below the algae, out of sight. 

On the way home the clouds rum­
ble and finally let loose a torrent of 
rain. I haven’t packed an umbrella, so 
I decide to make a run for it, holding 
the nearly empty backpack above my 
head. Everything weeps silver pearls 
of rain—the leaves, the lampposts, the 
umbrellas bobbing above faceless peo­
ple on 8th Avenue. 

When I get to the top of my street, 
I pause. I have nowhere to go, and the 
rain is beating down harder, but I can’t 
go home. The thought of my room with 
its moldy coffee cups and unfinished 
journals is repulsive now. The sky is a 
wash of gray, the sun hidden behind a 
sheet of clouds. It’s funny to think how 
closely my life obeyed the movement 
of the sun only a few months ago. I 
hardly notice it anymore. Night is the 
turning of a switch, day the opening of 
a computer. The low branch of a cherry

blossom tree dumps a soggy clump of 
white and pink petals at my feet, and I 
want to be anywhere else.

want to go home. I’ve been back at 
school for a month and everything is 
locked down. I’m sick of spending all 
day in my room with its peeling, tal­
low-colored walls, taking classes on my 
computer among a mess of plastic bowls 
and plastic utensils and paper coffee 
cups. I’m sick of scuttling through the 
fluorescent-lit tunnel beneath Cross 
Campus to the dining hall three times 
a day, where I have to sanitize before 
getting my food and the tables are fixed 
with plexiglass dividers. I’m sick of my 
cramped room, so small I hit my desk 
when I roll out of bed, I feel exhausted, 
overworked. I’m sick of my suitemates. 
I miss the pressure of my shower 
at home, and the gurgle of my coffee 
maker, and the drawer next to the stove 
with all my favorite snacks. I miss stay­
ing in bed all morning, and getting up 
to my mom cooking breakfast in the 
kitchen, and the reliable clickety-clack of 
my dad’s typing. I miss laughing with 
my siblings all night. I miss having too 
much time to know what to do with.

F
uck it. Shirt, pants, underwear, 
socks, toiletries, don’t forget con­
tact solution, shove it into a backpack, 
bring tape in case it rips, Uber to the 
station—ticket, purchased, activated—
Can I see your ticket? Metro North train 
rattling southwest over wooden tracks, 
lifting my mask for a quick bite of rub­
bery Sbarro pizza, Grand Central sta­
tion, shiny terrazzo floors give way to 
the familiar grit of the subway, shoving 
between rush-hour commuters on the 
downtown 4/5, this cannot be covid-safe, 
switch to the 2/3 at Nevins Street, ride 
a puff of hot air out onto the platform, 
emerge into sweet pollen-scented air, 
8th Avenue, petunias standing in a line 
above window boxes on Carroll, sheer 
white pillars on Garfield, mind the crack, 
bare branches of cherry trees, disrobed, 
delicate, a pirouetting ballerina with­
out her tutu, children laughing in the 
playground, a sign taped to the door, 
Welcome Home. 

I know just who I’ll be when I get 
inside, and I know just how quickly I’ll 
want to leave again. I oscillate between 
two competing versions of myself—
the part that rebels against this place, 
who yearns to go wherever it is you go 
to feel and hurt, and to come home 
triumphant, and the part who needs 
to be here because I don’t know what 
it means to exist anywhere else. For 
me, home is a riptide. It lurks always 
just beneath the surface, pulling me 
backward in time, back to the child 
cocooned in a circle of white light. I 
don’t think I can escape it until I learn 
how to want to. Maybe that’s what it 
means to grow up.
