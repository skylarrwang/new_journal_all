healthcare at Yale. Trinh found him­
self unable to get a medicine he’d been 
taking for six years twice throughout 
his first three years at Yale. After sev­
eral attempts to make an appointment, 
Trinh gave up trying. “I think I was one 
of those folks who kind of fell through 
the cracks of Yale Health.”


If there are cracks in Yale’s gen­
eral health system, then its Mental 
Health & Counseling department has 
chasms. Alumni and current gradu­
ate student workers alike recounted 
experiences with long wait times, 
short treatment windows, and poorly 
matched therapists.


“It’s an incredibly opaque system 
that requires an absurd amount of work 
on the part of people who need help,” 
Trinh said. “It seems set up to aggravate 
the very kind of conditions that health­
care is supposed to treat . . . I think we 
see the failures of that system reflected 
in—if I can be frank—the poor mental 
health outcomes of Yale students, both 
graduate and undergraduate.”


Others, like Winant, voiced their 
experiences of feeling misunderstood 
by healthcare professionals who had 
mainly been trained to deal with 18- 
and 19-year-old college students. “I felt 
like we were just getting processed and 
pushed through,” Winant said.


In a mental health system known 
for relegating all it serves to long wait 
times and dissatisfactory treatment ser­
vices, graduate student workers bear 
the brunt of the obstacles. Some prog­
ress may happen soon—Dean Cooley 
wrote to me that, in response to a push 
by the Graduate School Assembly, she 
anticipates a “gsas-specific embed­
ded mental health counselor” will be 
in place by Fall 2022—but, for many 
graduate student workers whose mental 
health needs have been long ignored, 
this comes too little, too late.


Paying the price

I
n addition to pointing out the need for 
safer working environments, Local 
33’s requests for contracts and better 
healthcare reveal the deeper economic 
precarity facing many graduate student 
workers. This starts, quite simply, with 
the salary Yale pays its student workers.


“The salary that Yale pays its grad­
uate students is no longer competitive 
in the way that it would’ve been, for 
instance, a decade ago,” Trinh told me 
over Zoom in April. The impact of this 
discrepancy, he noted, is much bigger 
than graduate students—it hurts the 
University, graduate student workers, 
and undergraduates alike when they 
“have to be taught by people who are 
worried about where their next pay­
check is going to come from.”


The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 
estimated the average wage for a “post­
secondary 
teaching 
assistant”—the 
best fit category for a graduate stu­
dent worker—was $41,170 in May 2021. 
Stipends in Yale’s Graduate School 
were recently raised and now range 
from $38,300 to $40,000—well below 
the national average, despite coming 
from one of the wealthiest universi­
ties in the world. While students can 
request additional family subsidies if 
they plan on expanding their families, 


Local 33 members
and allies march down
Hillhouse Avenue.
“And we’re starting to realize 
that these universities, even 
though they do do a lot of 
teaching and that is one of their 
missions, it doesn’t seem to be 
the primary mission anymore.”

or medical leave funds and conference 
fellowship funds, all of these require 
extra criteria and are not a baseline 
need met by the University. Graduate 
worker pay at peer unionized univer­
sities like Columbia, Harvard, and 
Brown is significantly higher—with 
minimum PhD pay at Brown resting at 
$42,411 per year, 10 percent more than 
Yale’s $38,300 despite Brown’s endow­
ment being $35.4 billion less.


“I think the big dirty secret of 
academia is that graduate student 
instructors—including at Yale—do a 
significant plurality of the teaching, 
if not the majority of the teaching,” 
Trinh said. “And the truth is that part 
of the way that these universities bal­
ance their books and make a profit is by 
underpaying us. That’s part of the cal­
culus they make.”


This calculus is being felt, hard, by 
graduate student workers, particularly 
amid the current period of inflation 
and rising rent prices.


“Rent has gone up,” Liu said over 
the summer. “People are really feeling 
the stakes of what’s going on and of our 
lack of power in the University.”


The New Haven Register reported 
that rent has climbed by about 25 per­
cent in New Haven in the past year. 
The average rent for a one-bedroom 
apartment in New Haven is $1,895 per 
month. Annually, this would cost grad­
uate student workers around $22,000—
about 60 percent of their salaries from 
Yale. Average rent is 32 percent of the 
typical Americans’ pay, according to 
Business Insider, and financial experts 
recommend keeping monthly housing 
costs at less than 30 percent of income. 
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor 
Statistics Consumer Expenditure Data 
from 2020, adding up the spending 
of an average American on only a few 
necessities—rent, transportation, and 
food—totals to $39,142, more than a 
thousand more than a base graduate 
worker salary.


Anti-union pundits often portray 
graduate student workers as ungrateful 
ivory tower elites, but many students 
are pushing back against this narrative.


“I come from a working class fam­
ily,” Madison Rackear, a fourth-year 
PhD student in the genetics depart­
ment, told me over the summer. “I was 
the first in my family to go to college. 
I do have student debt . . . moving to 
New Haven was a really big jump for 
me. I came straight from undergrad, 
and it required a lot of money and time 
and resources that were, I think, very 
stressful to me at that time. And I 
kind of came into New Haven feeling 
already as if Yale was not doing its due 
diligence to support graduate workers 
that it was recruiting to the area.”


Rackear went on to explain how 
they first worked in a lab at University 
of North Carolina, Chapel Hill in 
order to make money to stay on campus 
over the summer. After that, Rackear 
applied to graduate school knowing 
that a PhD in genetics would secure 
them more financial security, even if 
they weren’t planning on staying in 
academia.


“It really just allows certain doors 
to be open that are otherwise not in 



21
this field,” Rackear said. “So I went 
under the guise of some sort of finan­
cial security, and then unfortunately I 
think I quickly realized that that comes 
at the cost of a shorter period of finan­
cial instability for a lot of graduate 
workers, myself included.”


Local 33 alumnus Winant describes 
his own version of this “bargain”—
trading long-term financial security for 
short-term financial insecurity—which 
broke down when he arrived on cam­
pus in the fall of 2010.


“The academic job market was in 
really bad shape,” Winant said, adding 
that the “rough, impoverished seven 
years” of PhD work no longer trans­
lated to getting a high-paying job. “So 
it seemed to me like more power for 
people at the bottom end of the system 
seemed important if we’re gonna figure 
out how to renegotiate that bargain in 
some kind of way.”


The decline of stable, well-paying 
job opportunities for PhD students is 
not merely a historical phenomenon; 
it is very much a challenge of today. 
In 1995, roughly half of those teaching 
at colleges were tenured or on track 
to get it, as reported by The New York 
Times. Twenty-five years later, in 2020, 
a study by the American Association of 
University Professors found that only 
31 percent of American college faculty 
members were tenured or eligible for 
tenure. These numbers indicate the rise 
of contingent faculty—a class of faculty 
with lower pay, less job security, and less 
academic clout—who allow universities 
to balance their books and maintain 
large enrollment numbers. Since the 
majority of academic workers will end 
up in these precarious jobs, more grad­
uate student workers than ever before 
are fighting for a smaller pool of stable, 
tenure-track spots.


In 2014, after months of protests, 
open letters, and articles by Local 33 
organizers, the University rolled out 
an automatic, six-year funding plan 
in the humanities and social sciences. 
But Winant noted that the University 
framed it as an independently-driven, 
internal decision.


“They don’t want to convey to 
people that they’re participating in a 
kind of negotiating process,” Winant 
explained. “They want to have monop­
olized decision making.”


According to Winant, the role 
of graduate student workers was to 
generate pressure through petitions, 
open letters, demonstrations, and fac­
ulty conversations, which would then 
be passed up to the administration. 
The University would never negotiate 
openly with Local 33 because doing 
so would confer recognition, allowing 
graduate workers collective bargain­
ing power, increased autonomy, and 
the potential for even bigger change—
supported by legal protections.


Yale’s existential crisis

Y
ale is part corporation, part school. 
Navigating graduate student work­
ers’ search for worker recognition exac­
erbates its identity crisis. The question 
of Local 33’s status brings Yale’s dual­
ism to an unsettling head—forcing 
the University to admit that even its 
Cubes plastered with union 
demands stack high in front 
of President Salovey’s house, 
nearly obscuring it from view.
