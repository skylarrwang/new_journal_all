Wildfire (or August 7, near
the bend on Holt Drive)
Flames devoured the hillsides, 
exhaling conical smoke lines like 
the growing plumes of an old steam 
locomotive. From the heat changes, 
a northbound wind rose, scaling the 
marsh’s cattail walls. These grasses 
shifted as one infinite and limbless 
mass. But they remained, rooted in 
that spot, under the expanding gray 
air. Another gust delivered itself 
to the marsh, and those shaking 
bulrushes smacked together with a 
seeded, vibrating crack. With each 
ensuing blow more cattails burst in 
couplets. The smoke swallowed all 
shore greenery.
In his half of the wall-split 
home off the street on Holt Drive, 
the man with a pacemaker in his 
chest waits. “I am moving to those 
foothills beyond me,” he nods. He 
palms his chest, coughs, “Yes. I will 
move to the low foothills.” Outside, 
birch leaves trembled like a thou­
sand tambourines. 
He forgets, now, to close the win­
dows. The room fills with ash flakes. 
He wipes the table to set for dinner.
