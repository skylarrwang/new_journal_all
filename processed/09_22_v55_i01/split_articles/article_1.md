Dear readers, 
It started with a key and a 
health hazard.
They led us to the room. A busted 
couch, some metal drawers labeled 
Biz-Nass, filing pockets we’ve since 
swapped for Google Drive folders, a 
few ancient Mac desktops, someone 
named Jessica’s to-do list, a massive 
closet of archives dating back fifty-
five years, and a wood-lacquered 
fridge filled with God-knows-what 
and God-knows-how-much black 
mold—signs of a former New Journal 
life. We burst inside, and began 
gathering scraps of editors’ past.

We could spend this whole let­
ter telling you the otherwise under­
whelming story of how The New 
Journal lost touch with its headquar­
ters for a few years. Or we could tell 
you about the hours we spent clear­
ing the room so it could be rid of its 
biohazard and reunited with us. But 
we’ll spare those details. Instead, like 
we think good journalists do, we’d 
like to focus on something more 
ambitious—the collision between 
this dusty office and the magazine 
you’re holding in your hands.

The New Journal exists with 
or without a room. For the past 
few years, it’s been spread out over 
Zoom screens, a lonely seminar 
room in Davenport College, some 
cluttered tables in Berkeley College’s 
Mendenhall room, and the apart­
ment living rooms of this Managing 
Board, where we’ve pored over 
Google Docs and diction. A mag­
azine doesn’t need a home to be 
made, maybe because it’s one of the 
most people-intensive things you 
can do, and a collection of people is 
in itself a kind of place.

But it sure is nice to have a 
place, despite all that. And what’s 
inside these pages demonstrates 
why. In Volume 55, Issue 1 of The 
New Journal, place is everywhere.

Two pieces look at the hid­
den costs of making Yale a place 
for students. Our cover story, by 
Abbey Kim, follows the graduate 
student workers whose experience 
of Yale as a workplace have long 
been invalidated by Yale’s failure to 
recognize their union, Local 33—
but that may change soon. Saachi 
Grewal tunnels through the dark 
underbelly of Yale’s power plants, 
surfacing with the realization that 
the comforts of campus we don’t 
really think about—heating, elec­
tricity—have come at an indefensi­
ble cost to not only the planet, but 
also its power plants’ employees.

In the rest of the magazine, 
you’ll find other revisitations of for­
gotten places—made all the more 
real and immortal through the phe­
nomenal visual imaginations of our 
designers and Creative Director, 
Kevin Chen. We wander backwards 
in time, into natural history muse­
ums, New Haven’s Institute Library, 
a Pac-Man machine, the Berkeley 
College Woodshop, a house sur­
rendered to a wildfire—and with 
a personal essay, at the end of the 
magazine, we go home.

Putting out a magazine is like 
jumping off a cliff you’ve run a 
marathon to get to. As it should. 
Now it’s out of our hands, and in 
yours, where it belongs. These pages 
were made to be turned, folded, 
cut-up, spilled on and stowed away 
into your rooms’ shelves, corners, 
and crevices. They’re meant to 
be forgotten, then rediscovered, 
without having to locate a key
or exterminator.

In his piece, Austin Todd urges 
us to hold on tightly, let go lightly.
He put it well. We’re letting go, and 
we’re going home.
