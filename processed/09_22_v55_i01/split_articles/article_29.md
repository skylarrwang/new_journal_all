or A Procrastination-
Apology Text to my Editor
Hi this is terrible of me! 
There are factors involved 
which could be in my control 
but I’ve chosen to release them, 
which is my fault. I’m sorry for 
the bad communication.

1.

I wish we still took pictures
of our hands and feet
in the early mornings.

Roused from sleep
to snap each other.

Rubbing at our elbows
for warmth,
sparks that neared 
and disappeared.

2.

The sweetness of desire
ripping from the chest

when the ghost
that you desire is

mistiness, 

a gloss 
beyond 
the stretch 

of skin 
on bone 
the hip 

the strength 
you hope 
exists 

behind 
the veil 

the quiet.
—Beasie Goddu
