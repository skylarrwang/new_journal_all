dential administration that are more 
sympathetic to workers’ rights than 
their predecessors—has helped infuse 
this generation of Local 33 organizers 
with fresh enthusiasm. Organizers with 
Local 33 have helped campaign with 
New Haven Rising—a local activist 
group fighting for economic, social, and 
racial justice in New Haven—for Yale 
Respect New Haven, and this summer 
they canvassed to improve local hir­
ing practices. In Connecticut, Local 33 
has no shortage of governmental sup­
port. Like Hurt, many representatives 
from the New Haven Board of Alders, 
including its President Tyishia Walker-
Myers, attended and spoke at the rally. 
At the end of August, Connecticut 
Attorney General William Tong offi­
cially endorsed Local 33 and urged Yale 
to “commit to respecting [Local 33’s] 
rights to organize and unionize without 
interference or employer opposition,” 
marking one of the most significant 
endorsements in the group’s history.


These connections are also part 
of what makes Local 33 so unique. Its 
affiliation with unite here ties it to a 
broader network of hotel, food service, 
manufacturing, and laundry work­
ers across the country—a connection 
unlike those of the independent union 
efforts at other universities. And the 
support it has found in New Haven 
reflects the broader pro-labor senti­
ments of a city that champions workers’ 
rights and autonomy, as well as harbors 
frustrations with Yale as an employer. 
“When I come waltzing into your 
office and say, ‘hey, join the union,’ 
what I’m asking you to do is to think 
of yourself as having more in common 
with the person who cleans your office 
than with your advisor,” said Gabe 
Winant grd ’18, a former Local 33 orga­
nizer and current Assistant Professor of 
History at the University of Chicago. 
He spoke passionately and eagerly 
with me on the phone, the sounds of 
cars rushing through the background. 
“That’s one of the most amazing things 
about the organization: it actually asks 
you to think about what place you 
want to have in [New Haven], in this 
community, and the kind of complex 
and unequal social relationships that
make it up.”


Yale is no stranger to unions. The 
University already hosts five, two of 
which are affiliated with unite here—
the group behind the latest gradu­
ate student effort at Yale. However, 
the University has never acknowl­
edged Local 33—doing so would mean 
acknowledging Yale’s graduate student 
workers as actual workers, who work 
in labs, teach classes, and write grants. 
It’s a step that the administration has
historically been unwilling to take.
“I want to welcome you to the most 
unionized university in the country!” 
Proto announces to the crowd of pro­
testers, gesturing to the splendor of 
Schwarzman and Sheffield-Sterling-
Strathcona Hall behind him. “What’s 
wrong with this picture? How come 
the custodians that clean the class­
rooms have the terms of their working 
conditions in writing, and the graduate 
teachers that teach in those same class­
rooms are ignored by the University?”

A history of denial


Y
ale has long rejected the notion 
that graduate student workers 
can be anything more than students. 
“University leaders firmly believe that 
graduate students are . . . here to learn to 
be scholars and teachers,” Dean of the 
Graduate School of Arts and Sciences 
Lynn Cooley wrote in an email to me 
in July, using words to the same effect 
of all the University’s public-facing 
comments on graduate student work­
ers’ status for the past decade. “[T]heir 
curriculum includes opportunities to 
learn through instructing others.”


Graduate students, who are often 
required to work well over forty hours 
per week in order to teach classes and 
perform research, earn a stipend of 
$38,300 at Yale. There is little to no time 
for a second job, leaving these students 
overworked and underpaid—which 
Yale justifies by asserting that they are 
students, first and foremost, and stu­
dents aren’t full-time employees. To 
emphasize the labor they perform on 
campus, members of Local 33 refer to 
themselves as “graduate student work­
ers,” or even just “graduate ­workers” 
and “graduate researchers.” 


Graduate worker organizing at 
Yale has a rich history of action and 
pushback, as outlined in the Minnesota 
Review’s “On Strike at Yale,” writ­
ten by geso organizer Cynthia Young 
grd ’99. In 1971, teaching assistants 
in the Philosophy department with­
held fall semester grades to protest 
their wages—$400 per semester—and 
prompted the administration to dou­
ble TA wages. In 1986, seven teaching 
assistants formed the “TA Solidarity 
Group” to protest the poor working 
conditions at the University, which 
denied student workers health care or 
livable wages, with some workers not 
paid at all. Advised by a member of 
Local 34 who sat in on meetings, the 
group slowly grew and changed its 
name to the Graduate Employees and 
Students Organization (geso) in 1990, 
when it began seeking official union 
status. geso organized a majority of 
graduate student workers—1,400 out of 
2,200—in a series of strikes in the 1991–
1992 and 1995–1996 academic years. The 
University came down hard on organiz­
ers, threatening expulsion and holding 
disciplinary hearings that resulted in 
one teaching assistant losing her spring 
semester teaching job. Without federal 
worker status and protection, gradu­
ate student workers were left relatively 
defenseless against the University’s will 
despite widespread student support.


Insufficient labor laws and the 
precarity of relying on federal deci­
sion-making has placed graduate stu­
dent employees in a delicate position 
for much of their history. From the 
nineteen-thirties to the nineteen-
seventies, Congress frequently updated 
precarity of relying on federal
decision-making has placed graduate 
student employees in a delicate 
position for much of their history.

legislation to clarify the definition of 
workers. This trend ended with the 
1974 amendment of the National Labor 
Relations Act (nlra) to protect hospital 
and nursing home healthcare workers as 
worker rights were becoming increas­
ingly politicized. The original nlra law, 
passed in 1935, provided private-sector 
workers the rights to organize, seek bet­
ter working conditions, and represent 
themselves without fear of retaliation. 
After the 1974 amendment, matters of 
worker status, the right to organize, and 
collective bargaining fell into the hands 
of the National Labor Relations Board 
(­nlrb)—a federal agency governed by 
five President-appointed board mem­
bers, which primarily acts as a judicial 
body to decide private sector cases. 
These cases allow the Board to estab­
lish or curtail worker rights, the most 
controversial of which could then be 
reversed by subsequent board members. 
In 2000, the Clinton-led nlrb 
ruled to grant worker status, and thus 
protection of the nlra, to graduate 
student workers at private universities. 
Because the nlra protections do not 
apply to government employees, gradu­
ate student workers at public universities 
are exempt altogether, leaving individ­
ual states with the ability to determine 
workers’ rights to organize. But even 
graduate student workers at private uni­
versities soon lost their protections, as 
the decision was overturned and reversed 
by the Bush-appointed board in 2004.


In August of 2016, the Obama-
appointed nlrb re-affirmed that stu­
dent employees at private universities 
held the right to unionize. On the day 
of the decision, President Salovey sent a 
letter to the Yale community expressing 
his disagreement: unionizing, he said, 
would tarnish teacher-student relation­
ships with a “formal collective bargain­
ing regime.” Yale has continued to deny 
its student workers employee status. 
“Their opposition to the union was 
economic. They didn’t want to pay us 
more money, I’m sure,” Winant said. 
“But more than that, it was ideological. 
And that was why they fought so hard.”


Winant helped spearhead the last 
major push for a union during his final 
years at Yale, in 2016 and 2017. After 
the 2016 nlrb ruling, Local 33 quickly 
filed with the nlrb for a vote of legit­
imacy, pursuing departmental voting 
(a “micro-unit” strategy) as opposed to 
a simple majority. This strategy meant 
only a handful of departments—all of 
which had strong Local 33 support—
would proceed with official elections, 
with the hope of winning a union that 
would represent each individual depart­
ment rather than the entire graduate 
student body. The decision was con­
troversial, and the University publicly 
accused Local 33 of voter suppression as 
well as aggressive recruiting tactics. 
“When you organize workers or 
a group of people, the goal is to build 
power . . . you want to build enough 
power to protect the membership, to 
protect the workers,” Viet Trinh grd 
’18, a former Local 33 organizer, said 
after pausing for a moment. “In order 
to build power, you need to win.”


That power was tested when the
University took Local 33—then geso
