EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Writing my first essay, I met with 
both British Ed and American Alison. 
They are incredibly kind people. “Your 
thinking is like a firework!” British Ed 
told me. I do actually think he liked 
me. “But it means that sometimes you 
go too fast and get ahead of yourself, 
and don’t articulate your thoughts 
properly. Just work on those middle 
stages between the shell and the final 
explosion. I’m excited to see what you 
come up with.”


I met with American Alison to 
brainstorm and within ten minutes she 
told me I could drop the first essay if I 
needed to.
‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart 
and with all your soul and with all your 
mind and with all your strength.’ The second
is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’
No other commandment is greater than these.
(Mark 12:30–31)


At the end of the semester I stopped 
doing the readings for “Neighbors 
and Others.” In the beginning, when I 
had done the reading and had a lot to 
say, British Ed really liked me and I sat 
next to him most days. By the end of 
the year I was quiet, and sometimes I 
could feel his eyes on me, imploring. 
I’m not sure whether I imagined those 
questions in his gaze, urging me to 
speak! and learn! and practice thinking! 
and struggle please because it’s okay 
you’re safe here! But I stopped looking 
in his direction so I can’t say what really 
was in his eyes. I felt bad imagining he 
wanted what was best for me.


On the last day of the year we 
talked about all the texts we had read 
and each of us brought our favorite 
quotes to class and wrote them up on 
the board. One student skipped. But 
the discussion that day was beautiful 
and I could almost sense Professor 
Levene’s purpose for us, a purpose 
we had missed all semester, some 
path towards dissolving the divide 
between “Neighbor” and “Other.” But 
I still didn’t quite get it. I had trou­
ble understanding a lot of the quotes. 
Everything from Spinoza, Winicott, 
and de Castro confused me without its 
context, and the only sections I really 
understood were from the Bible and 
the first day of class. Love your neigh­
bor. Give to the poor. Take responsi­
bility and be good.


In a moment of silence just before 
the end of class, I spoke and addressed 
Andrew, reminding him of the task he’d 
been set at the beginning of the year—
to discover the class’s thesis himself.
“So what would you say now?” I 
asked, and people laughed. I really 
respect Andrew. This was his second to 
last day of Yale, and I was curious about 
what he had gotten from it all, when I 
felt like I understood so little.
“Oh!” he said. “I remember that. 
But I don’t think I could do a bet­
ter job than what we all brought here 
today. The quotes.” We all looked up 
at the board and read the quotes and 
were silent. Confronted with so many 
words and so many ideas from so many 
authors all at the same time, the letters 
spun together and I couldn’t under­
stand anything at all.


But alright, Andrew. Have it your 
way. The thesis is in the quotes. The 
meaning is in the quotes. You ­apparently 
have learned to read. I did not.
