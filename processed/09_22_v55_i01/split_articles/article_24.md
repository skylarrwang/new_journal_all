The Holy Bible:

Personals
In the beginning was the Word,
and the Word was with God,
and the Word was God.
(John 1:1)

L
ast year, I spent three hours every 
Wednesday afternoon being bat­
tered by the truth of Yale’s 7:1 
student-to-faculty ratio—more teach­
ers in a classroom is not always bet­
ter. There were nine students enrolled 
in “Neighbors and Others” and three 
teachers: 
the 
wonderful 
Professor 
Levene and her two TAs, American 
Alison and British Ed.

It wasn’t supposed to be like this. 
There were originally twenty-six stu­
dents. But on the first day of class a 
senior philosophy major, Andrew, asked 
Professor Levene what the thesis of the 
course was, and when she hesitated and 
told him to find out for himself, five 
people left the Zoom. Andrew stayed, 
but twelve other students dropped 
out over the next three hours as we
discussed the Bible, and I don’t know
why I didn’t follow them. I participated 
exactly once that day, at the very end of 
class, and nearly cried afterwards.

Am I my brother’s keeper?
(Genesis 4:9)

Y
ale seminars are scary. Once, when 
we were asked about the audience 
of a book, the class was subjected to a 
Davenport senior’s slow, thought out 
answer, adding terms one by one as 
he came across them: “The audience 
for this book is likely liberal . . . elite . . . 
intelligentsia . . .” he said, pausing for 
a moment, “and probably coastal. . .” 
He is a legacy student and from New 
Jersey; it felt like watching someone 
masturbate. I recall, during a class 
on Glenn Gould, hearing the phrase 
“sonic sounds” leave someone’s lips 
(sonically). And once, while work­
shopping an essay in a different class, 
I remember every student in the class­
room (myself included) complimenting 
the same awful metaphor about how, 
from above the lake’s surface, you can’t 
see how hard ducks paddle underwater. 
We each said what we liked about the 
essay and what we’d want to improve 
and then, when we ran out of things 
to say, added: “Oh, and I also liked 
your duck metaphor.” It was like baby 
ducks following baby ducks: a bunch of 
dumbasses paddling in a circle.

I wish so badly I could claim to be 
better than them, but I am not. I spent 
most of my first year too overwhelmed 
to participate in almost anything, and 
when I did speak I was only barely 
aware enough to register how dumb I 
sounded. No matter what was in my 
mind, everything seemed to come out 
the same way: “Nice ducks!”

We have different gifts, according to the 
grace given to each of us. If your gift is 
prophesying, then prophesy; if it is serving, 
then serve; if it is teaching, then teach.
(Romans 12:6–7)

T
alking to Professor Levene at her 
office hours, I learned that her pur­
pose for the class was teaching us to read. 
She could easily lecture to us about the 
texts and tell us what we should know, 
but she wanted us to learn to fight and 
figure things out for ourselves. It was 
obvious from our conversation that she 
didn’t think we were doing a good job.
