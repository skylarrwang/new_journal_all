Between the Books
N
early a decade ago, novelist and 
editor Ann Marlowe walked into 
the Institute Library on Chapel Street 
for the first time. She came in for one 
of their evening events—“probably 
one I saw in the paper,” she recalled. 
Immediately, she knew this was a spe­
cial place. Now, so many years later, 
Marlowe is still a dedicated volunteer.
Passing 
through 
the 
library’s 
wooden doors, it’s hard not to share 
Marlowe’s 
fascination. 
Near 
entrance sits a globe so old that 
Thailand is labeled “Siam.” Propped 
up on one of the shelves is a series of 
mounted insects, each painstakingly 
labeled behind a glass frame: a black 
swallowtail—Papilio polyxenes—or the 
green-clouded butterfly, Papilio troilus. 
Canoe paddles, hand-painted, hang
from the ceiling. There are ancient-
looking busts wearing surgical masks, 
an impressive vinyl collection, and 
posters boasting the subjects of some 
of the library’s most iconic evening 
workshops: Taxidermy, Theories in Time 
Travel, Ultimate Origami. 
Muted light filters through the 
windows into the front room. “This 
is the place for people who want a 
rare, quiet space,” said Jan Swiatek, 
Executive Director of the Institute 
Library. A loyal group of writers, stu­
dents, and editors frequent this private 
membership library, where it is easy to 
be inspired by its rare collections and 
rich history.
Founded in 1826, the library was 
originally called the Young Men’s 
Institute Library, and served as a center 
for academic development. “This was a 
time where you were lucky to get a fifth 
grade education from public schools,” 
explained Marlowe. 
In response, a group of men pooled 
their resources and acquired patronage 
from elders in the New Haven com­
munity to found a new library. By 1835, 
women had joined the membership, 
and a few years later, the space became 
a hub for abolitionist activity.
“In the nineteenth century, we 
were the center of intellectual ferment 
in the town,” said Marlowe. Despite 
New Haven’s conservatism at the time, 
members hosted speakers like Ralph 
Waldo Emerson, Frederick Douglass, 
and women’s rights activist Anna E. 
Dickinson.
Today, the library’s membership is 
around 220, significantly smaller than it 
was in the mid-twentieth century, when 
it peaked at around eight hundred. 
“[The library] is not a place with an 
endowment or a huge financial stream 
of resources,” said Ott. “It survived, 
all this time, without attachments to a 
patron donor. It’s always been supported 
by the community. And it’s open to all.” 
A portion of its income comes 
from annual membership fees. The 
cost starts at $30, though some choose 
to renew their fees up to $135, earning 
patron membership, to support the 
library’s mission. Only members can 
check out books, but the space is free 
for public use. 
Much of the library today remains 
just as it was in the eighteen-hun­
dreds. Maryann Ott, a member of the 
Institute Library Board, noticed this the 
first time she walked in. “Just the way it 
smelled, the way it looked, the colors, 
the books, and the people . . . I felt like I 
had been transported back in time.”
Although members like Ott are 
charmed by the library’s shabbiness, 
its age comes with challenges. Some

are common issues: peeling paint and 
a leaky roof, for instance, which the 
board just received two million dol­
lars in state funding to fix, largely
to cover historical preservation costs. 
Other problems are less orthodox. 
The library uses a unique classifica­
tion system called the Borden System, 
which was created and implemented 
by the library’s first professional librar­
ian, William Alanson Borden, in 1887. 
Maintaining this esoteric categoriza­
tion is a never-ending challenge. 
“We love the Borden system be­
cause it’s ours, and it’s historic, and it 
was born here,” said Swiatek. “But flex­
ibility is not its middle name.” 
The librarians still use the original 
card catalogs to log and organize their 
thirty thousand books. In the center of 
the first floor, in a set of drawers, thou­
sands of index cards are divided into 
twenty-six base classes, each lettered a 
through z, with subjects ranging from 
“Principal Continental Literatures” to 
“Philology” to “Amusements.” 
The Borden System is less specific 
than the widely-used Dewey Decimal 
System, created by Melvil Dewey a 
decade earlier. A book in Dewey’s sys­
tem is assigned a number—741.821, 
for example. Each place value rep­
resents a category: 700 for Arts and 
Recreation, 40 for Illustration, 1 for 
Book Illustration, and so on. In Borden’s 
system, the same book might be labeled 
“J26,” with the letter representing a 
category—Fine Arts—and the num­
ber representing the subcategory—
Illustration. Unlike in Dewey’s system, 
further subcategorization is arbitrary: 
archivists often sort further using only 
a handwritten note or description. One 
index card at the library, labeled “O5,” 
includes only the name of the book, 
“Uses of Diversity,” and a bizarre col­
lection of essay titles: “Questions of 
Divorce,” “Yule Log and the Democrat,” 
“More Thoughts on Christmas.”
In 1910, Borden was enlisted by an 
Indian prince, Maharaja Sayajirao iii, 
to install his classification system in 
libraries throughout Baroda, a state of 
the British Raj located in modern-day 
Gujarat. By 1913, there were only two 
places in the world that used Borden’s 
system: the Institute Library in New 
Haven, and the public library system in 
Baroda, India.
“I have to tell you, [Borden’s] is 
not an easy system to understand,” Ott 
said. “Which is probably why Dewey’s 
won out over Borden’s.” Eventually, 
Baroda, too, switched to the Dewey 
Decimal System.
The Institute Library is less will­
ing to change. Members and volun­
teers recoil at the mention of making 
the switch. “Borden was an import­
ant librarian,” said Ott, “and [his sys­
tem] is one of the things that makes 
us unique.” Seven thousand book titles 
are digitized, but hand-written index 
cards are still the primary tools for 
finding and sorting books. Members 
like Marlowe are currently working on 
digitizing the library’s essay collection, 
though this is no small task.
“Oh, boy, would we love volunteers. 
We would be able to expand our hours,” 
Swiatek said. “And we’d love to get 
more of the books into the computer.”
A dedicated group of members, 
largely older New Haven residents and 
avid readers, liven up the library. On 
Fridays, Frank Cochrane, one of the 
library’s most active members, leads a 
weekly jazz night.
“There’s a core group that usually 
shows up…maybe fifteen to twenty 
on a busy night,” Swiatek explained. 
“[Frank] is just so knowledgeable. You 
just sit for half an hour and listen to 
him . . . This week he’s doing the early 
years of Duke Ellington.” It’s Frank’s 
personal vinyl collection that fills the 
second floor. 
At biweekly sewing socials, fashion 
designers mingle with master beaders 
and fiber artists, one of which designed 
the canoe paddles hanging in the main 
room. There are Story Nights—sort of. 
“Connecticut’s version of ‘The Moth,’” 
as Swiatek puts it—and author talks. 
On Saturdays, the art gallery on the 
second floor hosts shows. And there’s 
still more to come: when asked about 
her favorite community event, Marlowe 
grinned. “It’s still a secret,” she said—
but it’s set to begin in the fall. 
Now, reflecting on her first time 
visiting the library, Marlowe is glad she 
took a chance on the newspaper adver­
tisement almost ten years prior. 
“When I walked through the door 
I thought, ‘Oh my god, I never want to 
leave,’” she said. “And I haven’t.”
