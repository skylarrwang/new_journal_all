Hold On Tightly,
Let Go Lightly
T
he first thing I noticed was the 
smell. Cedar pitch, freshly sawn 
pine, and a trace of coffee from the 
manager Mark’s travel mug, steam­
ing on a countertop. The characteristic 
smells of a woodshop—to be precise, 
the Berkeley woodshop. That fall in 
2019, I spent many Saturday mornings 
working on a small table, trimming and 
planing elm boards for the surface, cut­
ting mahogany legs with a jigsaw and 
sanding them smooth. It took months 
to finish, and I was proud of it. For a 
while the table lived in my suite, but 
eventually I moved it to the Silliman 
art room, giving the still-sharp smell of 
the varnish time to air out.
For thirty years the woodshop was 
open to anyone who would wake up at 
9 a.m. on a Saturday—and many did. 
It was a small space, but efficiently laid 
out. The large table saw, the dark green 
joiner, the lathe corner and the stacks 
of various boards and plywood—some­
how none of it really got in your way. 
For almost everyone I spoke with, the 
workshop was their escape from aca­
demic pressure. Over the years, and 
with Mark’s tutelage, this hidden com­
munity created blanket chests, sparring 
dummies, conductors’ batons, coffee 
tables with inlaid chess boards, salad 
bowls, hand-turned pens—all of a qual­
ity one would have trouble attributing to 
the untrained hands of undergraduates.
“The place used to be humming,” 
Mark told me. “People coming in, having
fun, ideas on the table.”
Today, the room that once housed 
the woodshop sits nearly empty, with 
only a couple computers and a couch. 
Maybe if you’re lucky you can spot a 
bit of sawdust still nestled beneath the 
baseboards.
One evening last summer, while 
working in Berlin, I gave Mark a call. 
Ever since the start of the pandemic, 
we’ve chatted and caught up every now 
and then. We spoke for a few hours—
with one brief interruption as Mark 
greeted a prospective blueberry picker 
and directed them to the patch behind 
his house—and we discussed his retire­
ment, the projects he’s still working on, 
Berlin, and finally, the woodshop.
“Do you think it’ll ever make a 
comeback?”
“No,” he said, flippant. “I’ll put it 
this way. How many darkrooms are left 
on campus?”
The answer is not many, and access 
to those remaining is limited. Wood­
working has gone in the same direc­
tion. While there are workshops for 
wood sculpture and some facilities in 
the Center for Engineering Innovation 
and Design (ceid), these are spaces 
restricted to students in the relevant 
classes, offer little to no guidance, or 
require an obstructive amount of train­
ing. And anyway, cutting plywood 
sheets on a cnc machine feels different 
than watching wood curl away under­
neath a sharp plane.
When I ask why Mark thinks the 
woodshop closed, his voice is solemn 
but his answer’s tongue-in-cheek: “It 
was YouTube.” Students can put on a 
woodworking video and get the satis­
faction of watching someone make 
something without the trouble of actu­
ally doing it themselves. Maybe so. 
But it’d be impossible to pin down 
exactly why the woodshop closed; 
there are so many plausible reasons. 
Saws are dangerous, students are busy, 
and instant gratification really is nice!
By and large the digital age has set 
traditional woodworking on uncertain 
footing, not to mention that “Saturday 
Morning Woodshop Hobbyist” is 
hardly prime resumé material. And this 
story isn’t new: the woodshop’s popu­
larity had been waning for years before 
Covid—some Saturday mornings in 
2019 it was just the two of us, and 
maybe a friend I brought along that 
day. Teru, who was a student during 
the late nineteen-nineties, was just 
amazed the Berkeley woodshop lasted 
as long as it did. 
The story of the Berkeley woodshop 
now resembles many of the projects that 
began there. A half-turned wooden 
cup, a chess set missing everything but 
pawns, two table legs abandoned on a 
shelf. We set down our tools and things 
remain incomplete, leaving behind 
ghostly traces. Or specks of sawdust.
Yet it doesn’t all disappear: people 
got more from the shop than simply 
the satisfaction of making something 
with their hands. One woodshop alum, 
now a plastic surgeon, left Yale with 
both a rock maple trestle-style coffee 
table and one of Mark’s adages: If you 
don’t have time to do it right, you don’t 
have time to do it twice. Another told me
that whenever he sees a ginkgo tree 
or tries to touch his toes, he thinks of 
Mark and the woodshop. He and his 
wife still use a mahogany salad bowl 
that Mark turned for them as a wed­
ding gift nearly every day.
The woodshop was an imperfect 
space. It was loud, the students often 
inefficient, and when Mark describes 
himself he often favors “grumpy old 
man.” But something special wove all 
of this together, something that now 
lives in the past. I don’t mean this in a 
let’s-try-to-revive-it way. Some things 
can’t be brought back and that’s okay. 
Instead, I’m remembering a phrase 
my ceramics teacher said sometimes 
when she sold or accidentally broke her
pottery: hold on tightly, let go lightly. 
I imagine Mark driving south down
I-91, as the 8 a.m. sun peeks through 
autumn foliage, or wintry snow-laden 
branches, or the fresh leaves in spring; 
this, nearly every Saturday of every 
semester for thirty years. I imag­
ine a student finally turning a bowl 
that doesn’t crack, someone laugh­
ing from the adrenaline of cutting a 
board on the table-saw, a student tak­
ing the first seat on a lacquered chair 
they’ve been working on all semester.
I imagine Mark smiling with them.
On the phone, Mark told me that 
on every job—whether it’s building 
a kitchen or restoring a dresser—you 
always end up bleeding a little. For most 
of his career he’d wipe this inevitable bit 
of blood off. These days, he leaves it on, 
sealing it over with a layer of Shellac. 
“It’s like saying I was there.”
When I returned to campus in 
2021, the table I’d made in the wood­
shop was gone. Maybe it’s my fault for 
leaving it in the Silliman art room, but 
in any case, it’s gone, and it’s alright. 
Sometimes I show people pictures, say­
ing maybe one day it’ll show up. And 
sometimes, I call Mark and remember 
the woodshop.
