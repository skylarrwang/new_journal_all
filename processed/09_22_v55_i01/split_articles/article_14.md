T
he blue whale model loomed 
over me, the white paint of 
its belly striated by blue light. Sounds 
of ocean waves crashed and drifted 
in and out of my ears as I peered into 
each diorama of the Ocean Hall 
exhibit, longing to step inside. I closed 
my eyes—I want to stay here forever,
I thought, jetting across the sea with 
giant squids and ammonites. I was 6 
years old, and my fascination propelled 
me through every collection of the 
American Natural History Museum. 
That feeling—the intense desire to 
walk out of your own body into a world 
you can only imagine—was magic.
This is my earliest memory. At that 
age, all aspects of natural history cap­
tivated me. Dinosaurs leapt from the 
pages of books and became characters 
in a fairytale I could 
step into. I dove deep 
into the sea of natural 
history media: I spent 
hours watching documen­
taries where I saw mosa­
saurs swallow sharks whole. 
During reading periods at 
school, I’d flip through stories 
of archaeologists and paleontol­
ogists unearthing ancient civili­
zations and specimens in National 
Geographic Kids magazines, and 
I’d collect figurines of mammoths, 
saber-toothed tigers, and sau­
ropods. Other kids my age 
also let their imagination min­
gle history and nature. Some of 
my friends pretended they were 
ancient royalty, while others dug 
for fossils in the sand next to their 
castles. We saw transformation in 
everything: we watched caterpillars 
turn into butterflies, and we ran around 
the playground with arms spread 
like the wings of a monarch. As 
we got older, we shed more than 
cocoons. We let the remarkability 
of the natural world slip.
I can’t remember when I 
stopped dreaming of dinosaurs. 
My figurines are still on my book­
shelves, but that child who could 
name creatures long extinct, who 
took pride in classifying them as 
herbivores and carnivores, feels like a 
stranger. Her fantasies of swimming 
with the squids have abandoned me
—or rather, I was the one who aban­
doned them.
Trace fossils remain, reminding 
me how she lived her life devoted to 
nature and driven by curiosity. I still 
love museums and world histories, but 
natural specimens just didn’t stick. I 
don’t know why, but my world became 
far removed from trilobites and pteran­
odons. Until recently, that is.
This summer, I interned in commu­
nications at the Yale Peabody Museum 
of Natural History. As I peered through 
each of the Peabody collections—Inver­
te­brate and Ver­te­brate Paleon­tolo­gy, 
Anthro­polo­gy, 
Paleo­bo­tany, 
Ento­
mology, and the Baby­lonian Coll­
ection—I searched for objects that spoke 
to me, that I thought would catch the 
eye of online audiences on Instagram, 
Tik­Tok, and Twitter. Collection man­
agers would tell me why they mattered 
in scientific research or in distinct cul­
tural contexts, and I’d pore over books 
in Sterling Memorial Library to learn 
more. I’d look at trilobites up close in 
Invertebrate Paleontology and then 
scrounge for information about what 
the life of these distinctly-diverse and 
highly-populated arthropods were like 
before extinction. I even got to see 
the skeleton of Togo, the heroic sled 
dog of the 1925 serum run to Nome, 
Alaska, that saved many lives. My job 
was to translate these complex pieces 
of information into digestible bits for 
a broader audience on social media. In 
videos, and writing, I told the stories 
of inanimate objects and specimens in 
pursuit of the answer to the question: 
“Why do objects matter?” This ques­
tion was to be seen as the guiding point 
for each story. It is what drew me to 
the position—I heard that child’s voice 
again, telling me that it was time to lis­
ten to the millions of voices of the past.
The work was slow. Not every object 
yields an interesting story. Sometimes, 
the work meant looking at a pile of 
rocks that had been stored in cabinets 
for hundreds of years. I wished these 
fossilized creatures could whisper in my 
ear all the secrets from the generations 
of hands they have passed through—
tell me about their birth and creation, 
under what conditions they lived and 
died, or how they toiled in the myster­
ies of the natural world. There is some­
thing inexplicable and magical about 
seeing the vestiges of the past up close. 
One day, I was looking at a collection 
of cuneiform tablets in the Babylonian 
Collection. There was nothing par­
ticularly interesting about their con­
tents—just letters detailing finances to 
family members and other economical 
logistics—but within the black crevice, 
incised into the clay, was the name of 
the scribe who had crafted it. I could 
almost see the stylus touching the soft 
clay, and the tablet drying in the 
sun. I imagined it making its 
way underground, surviving 
over hundreds of years, only 
to reemerge in a small box, 
neatly tucked away inside 
a wooden cabinet in the
Yale Peabody.
Every moment spent 
in the collections is an 
intimate dance with 
curiosity. Time slows 
down so much that it begins to move 
backwards. I surrender to my curiosity, 
opening drawer after drawer, ignor­
ing the Latin names I can barely pro­
nounce. I hold dinosaur bones and 
mammoth teeth, peer into the inci­
sions made into the clay of cunei­
form tablets, and stare wide-eyed 
at jars full of maggots. I pull 
out scientific articles, and revel 
in others’ research. All this I haven’t 
had the excitement to do since I was a 
kid. And I’m able to take fragments
of the collection with me in the pieces of
information I collected along the way.
Enheduanna, an Akkadian prin­
cess and high priestess from the twen­
ty-third century bce, is known as the 
first named author in human history. 
She was a poet who wrote moving sto­
ries and incantations to the goddess 
Inanna. When I think about her writ­
ings in tandem with older pieces of the 
collection, like dinosaur bones and lit­
tle trilobites, I think about how one can 
tell the story of time that is forever roll­
ing. In my head, I swim through the 
Cambrian Explosion to the Ice Age and 
try to leap into the present, wondering 
how we got from microscopic creatures 
in the sea to prayers spelled out on clay 
tablets. These are the shifts in humanity
and in the natural world that can be 
unveiled after opening one’s mind to 
the curious life of objects. Throughout 
all this time they have remained intact. 
Regardless of their popularity, old bones
outlive us all.
