**Yale's Power Plants: A Look Inside**
**Author: Saachi Grewal**
**Page number(s): 24**

“I 
wanted to add some Yale 
Blue to the steam,” Cox tells 
me, “but the managers didn’t 
want to call attention to ourselves.”


Jeremy 
Cox, 
the 
Sterling 
Power Plant manager, gestures 
towards three exhaust pipes, each 
jutting around six stories towards 
the sky. One pipe is frosted with 
cream ornamentation; the others 
are twin steel limbs. They churn out 
an invisible cloud of billowing emis­
sions, as they do every day, all year. 
The red-bricked buildings of the 
Sterling Power Plant, scattered at the 
base of the pipes, emit a loud growl 
that can be heard from around the 
block. Intermittently, a raucous clang 
or hiss sounds from an appendage of 
the building, but the noise dissipates 
before I can determine its source. 
Cox is poised by the door to the 
underground plant, peering out from 
under his yellow hard hat as I fum­
ble with a notebook and pen. I men­
tion the bestial noises to Cox, but he 
appears to barely register the clamor. 
Once he ushers me inside, we walk 
down a hallway lined with snaking 
pipes and diagrams of turbines. If not 
for the Yale bulldog logo on his hoodie, 
it would be difficult to remember that 
we’re less than half a mile away from 
the ivy-draped buildings of campus.
