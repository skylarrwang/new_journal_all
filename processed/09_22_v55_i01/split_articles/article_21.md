The Sterling Plant powers
the Yale School of Medicine 
and the Hospital. It’s one of two 
plants on Yale’s campus, the other 
being the Central Power Plant 
that operates on Grove Street. 
They’re easy to miss: neither is 
marked with signposts nor touted 
from the outside for powering the 
University. Cox told me about the 
University of Alaska adding a light 
show with their school’s colors to 
their power plant, but Yale seems 
intent on keeping its plants hidden 
from the public eye.


With revamped exteriors, it 
is difficult to tell that the Central 
Power Plant and Sterling Power 
Plant were built in 1918 and 1923, 
respectively. But on cold days, the 
steam pouring from the gothic-style 
exhaust stacks resembles the ashen 
clouds of a coal-fired plant, a scene 
straight out of a photograph of early 
industrial America. The plants’ unas­
suming appearance conceals a history 
of harmful practices from the pass­
erby’s eye—a legacy of slow-paced 
improvement, of Yale disregarding 
employee health and student wellbe­
ing, swept into coal-dusted shadows.


The Endowment Justice 
Coalition publicized the extent 
of Yale’s investments in fossil 
fuels in 2021—an estimated 800 
million to 2.5 billion dollars; it’s 
hard to know for sure due to a 
lack of transparency. Unlike 
Yale’s 
investment 
practices, 
the power plants haven’t been 
held to the same level of scru­
tiny. While the full tale of Yale’s 
energy infrastructure can only be 
traced through obscure finan­
cial documentation and lessons 
in thermodynamics, the conse­
quences are tangible to us all, 
even if they’re easy to ignore—flip 
the light switch or turn on the hot 
water, and you’re consuming fos­
sil fuels. As universities across the 
country are forced to reckon with 
global calls for cleaner energy gen­
eration, Yale will have no choice 
but to reconsider its priorities and 
role as a research university, not a 
hedge fund with a school attached.


If the power plants tell us one 
thing, it is that transformations in 
Yale’s energy infrastructure aren’t 
simple, fast, or necessarily effec­
tive. Yale’s energy history—from 
the first, cursory dappling of coal-
fired plants to modern renewables 
projects—is patched together with 
stories of belated improvement 
and myopic preparation, especially 
to the impact their efforts have on 
surrounding communities. We now 
stand on the cusp of yet another 
inflection point in energy history. 
As we once again entrust Yale to 
responsibly steward an update of 
on-campus energy infrastructure, 
it is more important than ever to 
understand the full scope of power 
the University possesses when it 
comes to energy production, how 
it’s leveraged that power in the past, 
and the human consequences that 
are too often taken as secondary to
“progress.” There may be no better way 
to do so than to look to the exhaust 
pipes of the Yale power plants.


Early in Yale’s history, the Univer­
sity’s method of generating electricity 
frustrated campus residents. Before the 
Central Power Plant was constructed, 
several smaller plants burned coal to heat 
and light buildings. These plants—scat­
tered near classrooms and below dining 
halls—left campus cloaked in black soot. 
Yale paid little attention 
to complaints as the issue of 
coal ash lingering near living 
spaces became exacerbated in 
the 1910s. Students and fac­
ulty were at risk of incurring 
chronic respiratory irritation 
and exposure to a rank, sulfu­
rous compound that burnt coal 
releases. “The value of the plant 
from a hygienic standpoint can­
not be computed in dollars and 
cents,” a 1911 Yale Daily News 
article reads. “Pure air in our 
dormitories and lecture rooms 
is a consideration not to be for­
gotten.” It was only when the 
University planned on expanding 
its operations with the construc­
tion of a new dormitory that the 
inefficient system of the smaller 
plants was called into question. 
Donations eventually enabled the 
construction of the Central Power 
Plant in 1918, a symbol of Yale’s 
self-sustainability, and its grow­
ing power as an institution.

In addition to spewing 
noxious coal dust around 
campus, the new plant threat­
ened the safety of its workers 
attending to the outsized oper­
ations, driving employees to 
strike for higher pay in 1941. 
“They had the proverbial coal 
man working then who would 
shovel coal into the furnace,” 
said Cox, “They were constantly 
breathing in that coal dust.” 
The coal dust particles, smaller 
than one-thirtieth the width of 
a human hair, meander into the 
lungs and bloodstream where 
they can cause a host of chronic 
lung, heart, brain, and ner­
vous system diseases. The plant 
clearly wasn’t built to address 
the concerns about student or 
employee health.


As we walked through 
the power plant’s underbelly, 
Cox mentioned that he had 
worked in a coal-fired plant for 
a short while, prior to his job at 
Yale. Running his hands along 
some pipes sealed with nuts 
and bolts, he said, “If the seals 
weren’t perfect, I would breathe 
in all these coal particles—I’m 
healthy now, but who knows 
what I might come down with 
in the future.”


Cox showed me the old 
furnace, power washed but still 
stained with a black hue. His 
flashlight illuminated a mum­
mified pigeon at the bottom of 
the cavern and we lingered there, 
silent, in the macabre scene. 
“Sometimes I wish I could see 
what it was really like back then,” 
he said, before being interrupted 
by his cell phone’s ringtone: the 
sound of a Star Wars lightsaber 
unsheathing.


In the 1940s, Yale’s Central 
and Sterling plants burned through
35,000 to 40,000 tons of coal 
annually, the weight of the Statue 
of Liberty. A Yale Daily News arti­
cle from 1953 describes how the 
clock hands of Harkness Tower 
were barely visible through the 
power plant “smaze”—a mixture of 
smog and haze spewed by the 
plants’ smokestacks. 


From the 1940s to the early 
2000s, Yale consistently strug­
gled to meet Connecticut’s 
baseline air pollution regula­
tions. Yale attempted to clean 
up its act by weaning off coal, 
but in doing so became com­
pletely reliant on natural gas, a 
colorless and odorless fossil fuel 
that was burned alongside coal 
in the plants since the 1910s. In 
the 1960s, Yale managed to cut 
its power demands by 10%, and in 
the decades after tweaked existing 
machinery to further lower emis­
sions. But, by 1992, Yale’s Senior 
Energy 
and 
Environmental 
Engineer declared that the plants 
were still not meeting the state’s air 
pollution standards. 


Yale’s slow progress isn’t nec­
essarily surprising. It’s risky for a 
campus to experiment with new 
energy technologies. Lab spaces, 
classrooms, and dorms could all 
go dark without large, consis­
tent stocks of energy, which is not 
something the University would 
leave to chance. Even during short 
outages caused by union strikes 
in the 1950s, campus life was dis­
rupted as undergraduates took up 
maintenance duties on campus. It

wasn’t until 2007—when Yale 
replaced old machinery with 
a turbine able to concurrently 
produce hot steam and elec­
tricity, a setup called cogenera­
tion—that Yale met state codes. 
The cogeneration setup is im-
pressive to behold: studded with 
windows revealing hot blue gas, it 
spans the length of a large bus. I 
don a hard hat and earplugs before 
Cox leads me to the gas turbine 
and opens the metal double doors. 
Out belches ­oil-smelling fumes 
and a booming clamor that sounds 
like a plane continuously taking 
off. “It’s like a big gas-powered grill 
on its side attached to a jet turbine 
engine,” yells Cox.


Cogeneration was the main 
cause of the 43 percent reduction 
of Yale’s greenhouse gas emissions 
from 2005 to 2020. In a typical 
power generator, heated steam spins 
a large fan-like turbine and exits 
the smokestacks in 1200°F plumes. 
Cogeneration captures the warm 
steam, recycling its energy before 
letting out a cooler 300°F stream 
through the pipes. Yet, the technol­
ogy isn’t revolutionary. Cogeneration 
first appeared in early 20th century 
American power plants and was only 
adopted in industrial plants after it 
was promoted as an energy-efficient 
technology in the 1978 purpa act. 
Yale adopted the technology around 
the time other American universities 
got on the bandwagon.


Each year, the exhaust pipes still 
release 198,000 metric tons of green­
house gasses, the weight of the Sears 
Tower. “Natural gas is not the pana­
cea,” stressed Kenneth Gillingham, 
Professor of Economics at the Yale 
School of the Environment. 


If the emissions themselves weren’t 
harmful enough, there is the matter of 
how Yale sources their natural gas. Yale 
is the largest consumer of Southern 
Gas Connecticut (sgc)—the father 
company of which, Enbridge, 
was responsible for one of the 
country’s largest oil spills in 
2010, and has been met with 
popular 
governmental 
backlash for its destructive 
fracking practices. Yale’s ties 
to Enbridge can only be found 
with incessant digging through 
financial records and obscure 
documentation—it’s a well-kept 
secret. While Yale leverages 
Enbridge’s resources to power 
campus, it shrouds its behavior 
in greenwashed rhetoric. “In my 
day, they were called smoke­
stacks,” Cox tells me. “Now, 
there’s a bit of a pr campaign to 
make it sound a lot cleaner. So 
exhaust pipes it is.”


Not only does the University 
mask how it sources its natural 
gas, Yale also isn’t contractually 
allowed to sell the power it gen­
erates. The result: Yale operates 
on an isolated microgrid with its 
two plants releasing nearly four­
teen times more greenhouse gases 
than the nearest energy facility in 
New Haven. “Yale had this idea 
early on and was like, you know 
what, we should create our own 
power,” said Cox, emphasizing the 
last part in a booming voice. This 
leaves the University in complete 
control of its operations: Yale 
can choose what type of fuel to 
use, doesn’t need to negotiate 
pricing with energy compa­
nies, and can produce however 
much energy it wants. Yale’s 
historical 
self-sustenance 
is 
what let the plants emit fossil 
fuels emissions above state pol­
lution standards in the 2000’s: its 
older plants weren’t expected to 
comply with modern standards. 
It also will keep the University 
safe during widespread outages 
caused by storms and the city of 
New Haven dependent on Yale 
energy. By isolating itself from 
the grid, Yale has continued to 
keep its resources within the uni­
versity and its power consolidated.


The time has come again for 
Yale to consider revamping its 
energy infrastructure. The Biden 
administration has cracked down 
on natural gas processing facili­
ties and Governor Ned Lamont 
promises that Connecticut will 
be carbon-free by 2040. The 2021 
Yale 
Sustainability 
Progress 
Report announces Yale will use 
“emerging technologies” like geo­
thermal heat and green hydrogen 
fuel to be carbon-free by 2050, but 
progress has been slow and largely 
underwhelming.
