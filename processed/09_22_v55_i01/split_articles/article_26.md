Mid-March, 2020
Today I’m going home for the 
first time in months. I no longer 
notice the petunias just begin­
ning to flower in the window boxes on 
Carroll Street, or the Corinthian col­
umns flanking the entrance to the syn­
agogue on Garfield. Without having to 
look, I lift my wheelie suitcase over a 
particularly big crack in the pavement 
outside my old orthodontist’s office. 
I’ve tripped over that crack enough 
times to know it’s there.


The sun dropping over the heads 
of the brownstones traces a golden 
path on the concrete, at the end of 
which, I know, is my parents’ house. 
“Parents’ house” is something I’ve only 
just started to say, a phrase picked up 
from college friends still waiting for the 
right place to give the word “home”. I’m 
lucky, I know where mine is—but I like 
“parents’ house” anyway. It gives me 
the same thrill as signing my name on a 
check, or tipping someone and saying, 
“keep the change”.


I know just how the house will 
be when I get there. The setting sun 
will draw the color from the bricks, a 
mosaic of pink and brown. The wind, 
still sharp with the last bite of winter 
frost, will rustle through the branches 
of the cherry blossom tree standing on 
the sidewalk next to our stoop. Across 
the street is my old elementary school, 
and the children will be laughing and 
screaming in the playground. There’ll 
be a “Welcome Home!” sign taped to 
the front door, the work of my younger 
sister, Ruby, who’ll be sitting by the 
window waiting for me. 


I know just how I’ll be, too, when I 
get there. I’ll hug my parents, my mom 
first and then my dad an hour later once 
he’s finished his meeting. We’ll sit down 
at the dining room table and rehash 
things I’ve already told them on the 
phone. (“So you ended up getting lunch 
with that girl? Any potential there? Just 
give it time, honey.”) All of us will eat 
dinner together and talk about Trump’s 
press conference, about my parents’ 
work, and family friends who are hav­
ing marital problems. (“Did you hear 
she’s leaving him? But they’ve got a 
baby on the way! Good thing she’s get­
ting out while she still can.”) Tonight, 
when everyone’s asleep, I’ll walk into 
the kitchen to make myself a sandwich 
and feel the numbing dread of discover­
ing a souvenir of my childhood in every 
drawer. A feeling of awful inevitabil­
ity—the moment of quiet just before 
the doll in the horror movie starts to 
move. Here’s the plastic blue spoon I 
used to eat my first bowl of applesauce. 
The black neoprene lunch box from kin­
dergarten with my name scratched on it 
in Sharpie. The photograph of me as a 
baby, my eyes wide and happy above a 
mask of chocolate icing. 


At night I’ll fall into bed and my 
mattress will embrace me like an old 
friend. I’ll stare at the ceiling and start 
to feel that familiar feeling. A slack­
ening, a lassitude. Water swirling and 
glug-glugging down a drain in my chest. 
I’ll make a promise to myself that this 
time will be different—I’ll go on a long 
walk tomorrow—at least three hours—
but when I wake up it’ll be 11:00 and 
I’ll take out my phone and scroll 
through Instagram until the fog clears, 
and when I finally get out of bed the 
day will be half-gone and my slippers 
so comfortable and what’s the point in 
trying to do anything productive now 
anyways? I’ll walk into the kitchen and 
snap at my mom when she asks me how 
I slept. “Fine,” I’ll say, and pour myself 
a cup of coffee from the pot, without a 
thought as to how it had gotten there, 
or how come it’s noon and the pot is 
still full and still hot. “You always 
needed your sleep,” she’ll say. “Just like 
when you were a kid.”
Lotus-eating among the cherry blossoms.
