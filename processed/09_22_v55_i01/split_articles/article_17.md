—to court in the fall of 2016. Yale 
asserted that graduate students were 
not workers—an ideological position 
in direct violation of the nlrb rul­
ing—and that departmental elections 
should not be allowed. The University 
hired Proskauer Rose llp, a New York 
City-based law firm notorious for 
union-busting that has fought against 
workers at Volkswagen, players in the 
nfl, nba and nhl, and, most recently, 
technology and product staffers at The 
New York Times. 

What should have been a routine 
hearing, culminating in the dismissal 
of Yale’s case, ended up lasting around 
two months. Winant attributed this 
delay largely to the University slow­
ing down proceedings by deliberately 
submitting paperwork incorrectly or 
requesting additional hearings on triv­
ial matters, a tactic “universal to union 
busting” to demoralize and frustrate 
union organizers.

Ultimately, the judge ruled in 
favor of Local 33. The group held elec­
tions in nine of the Graduate School 
departments in February of 2017, win­
ning in eight of them. Yale appealed 
the hearing’s results, forcing a sec­
ond legal battle. Between the initial 
hearings and the election, Trump was 
elected president, forcing Local 33 
organizers to prepare for an anti-labor 
administration that could reverse the 
2016 nlrb decision granting graduate 
student workers the right to unionize.

In hopes of forcing Yale to nego­
tiate, and calling attention to the 
University’s strategic stalling of delib­
erations so that they would carry over 
into Trump’s term, Local 33 members 
turned to demonstration. They held 
rallies during a weeks-long hunger 
strike, with several demonstrators 
requiring wheelchairs due to complete 
exhaustion, and occupied Beinecke 
Plaza with an encampment—dubbed 
33 Wall Street—sporting picnic tables, 
electrical lighting, and bookcases full 
of board games, history textbooks, and 
political nonfiction.

Ultimately, the fight for formal 
recognition was unsuccessful. In the 
summer of 2017, Yale’s Local 33 orga­
nizers made the painful decision to 
withdraw their petitions from the nlrb, 
alongside other graduate student work­
ers at Boston College and the University 
of Chicago. The organizers feared a 
hostile Trump-appointed nlrb could 
use any one of their cases as an excuse 
to overturn the 2016 decision and revoke 
graduate student workers’ right to 
unionize across the country. They hoped 
for their right to organize to continue 
existing, to get through the next four 
years, and to eventually restart the for­
mal recognition process, post-Trump.

Finding agency
“I 
think one of the things that’s pretty 
remarkable is just how constant 
some of the things are,” Ridge Liu, 
Co-President of Local 33 and fifth-year 
PhD student in the physics department, 
told me. Liu explained that, through­
out his entire time at Yale, people have 
talked about the same issues—lack 
of a third party grievance procedure, 
good mental healthcare, support for 
international students. Without a union,
he believes these problems will con­
tinue to haunt future generations of
graduate workers.

Liu began his time at Yale in 2018, 
during the Trump administration, on 
the heels of Local 33’s defeat in gain­
ing union status. He recalls the end of 
his first year culminating in “A Failure 
to Commit,” a report holding the 
University accountable for its failure to 
deliver on promises of hiring more New 
Haven residents, as well as recruiting 
more faculty of color. The report under­
scored that without formal account­
ability methods—like a unionized 
staff—Yale would continue to violate 
its espoused values of diversity, equity, 
and inclusion behind closed doors.

Today, organizers with Local 33,
Locals 34 and 35, and other New Haven 
organizations like New Haven Rising 
have continued to press Yale to expand 
their local hiring practices and con­
tributions to New Haven. Many hope 
Local 33 could push Yale to increase 
its financial support of New Haven, 
provide a higher baseline support for 
all of its workers, and truly commit to 
diversity in hiring goals.

“A union would also give us the 
power to hold Yale accountable and 
make this a university that doesn’t just 
talk about lofty goals of bettering the 
world but makes real, material commit­
ments to the New Haven community 
that supports and surrounds it,” Micah 
English gsd ’26, a PhD student in the 
Political Science Department, said at 
the rally, peering out at the crowd in 
front of her from beneath her brown 
knitted bucket hat. She highlighted 
research demonstrating that unions 
help foster racial solidarity and increase 
feelings of belonging. “As members of 
the Yale community, we should do all 
we can to ensure Yale is living up to its 
stated value of justice and fair opportu­
nities for all.”

A union, English said, could help 
formally enact protections for gradu­
ate student workers by establishing a 
grievance procedure. Currently, issues 
that arise in the workplace have to be 
taken up with supervisors—including 
grievances caused by their own supervi­
sors. An independent third party could 
receive those complaints and handle 
them without bias. Local 33 members 
tout neutral third party arbitration, 
along with increased inclusion and 
diversity, as possibilities enabled by a 
union contract.

“Autonomy in the workplace is 
one good, important issue, but broader 
welfare practices and safety nets are 
important for any sort of worker, 
including graduate students who are 
teaching and doing research,” Mustafa 
Yavas grd ’20, a Local 33 alum and 
postdoctoral associate in the nyu Abu 
Dhabi sociology department, told me 
in a voice memo in April. 

These demands are not abstractions 
for the Local 33 organizers, but every­
day realities born from lived experience. 
Liu came to Yale to study theoreti­
cal particle physics, a branch of phys­
ics that examines the components of 
the universe in their most basic forms. 
But at the beginning of the pandemic,

up Hillhouse Avenue to 
President Salovey’s house.


funding uncertainties and the diffi­
culty of working online forced Liu out 
of his research group. He now studies 
subatomic particles called neutrinos 
with an experimental particle physics 
group, expressing that even though he 
enjoys this group, he’s frustrated that 
Yale pulled back on his original group’s 
funding in a year where their endow­
ment grew by billions of dollars. 

“We need a contract. We don’t 
have a document that lays out: here’s 
the conditions of our work; here’s what 
you get for doing this work. If things 
go wrong, here is a process that you 
can trust that will…get a resolution 
for you,” Liu explains. “None of those 
things are codified in a way that is 
binding and that we as graduate work­
ers really have a way to be at the table.”

Liu’s co-president, Seltzer, who 
works in the history department, shared 
his experience with lack of agency 
at the April rally: “We’ve taught in 
crowded, poorly ventilated rooms with 
no guarantee of high quality masks and 
no consistent policies for what happens 
if we or our students get Covid. I need 
a union because I need a say in the basic 
conditions of the work that I do.”

An unhealthy relationship
T
he pandemic forced another of 
Yale’s shortcomings into the spot­
light: healthcare. From big picture issues 
like mental health coverage, expensive 
dental and visual premiums, to the day-
to-day safety conditions of the labs they 
work in, graduate student workers are 
finding themselves left unattended by 
the institution they work for. 

Expensive healthcare premiums 
exist on top of substantial out-of-pocket 
costs. Buğra Şahin, an international stu­
dent and third year in the Chemical and 
Environmental Engineering depart-
ment, recounted paying $3,000—about 
8 percent of his yearly salary—out of 
pocket for a medically necessary dental 
procedure last year, leaving him living 
paycheck to paycheck. 

When he spoke at the rally, Şahin’s 
voice was full of passion, reach­
ing a firm, forceful crescendo at his 
conclusion: “To be able to flourish and 
excel in our work that we do for Yale, 
mind you, we have to have our basic 
healthcare needs met,” Şahin said.

Local 33 alum Yavas remembered 
the lack of dental and vision coverage 
from his time at Yale, adding, “It’s 
obscene that dental care and eye care is 
still not included in the graduate stu­
dent healthcare package, as if our eyes 
and our teeth are not part of our bodies 
or health.” No changes to the current 
healthcare plan have been reported as 
of the start of the 2022 academic year.

Graduate worker unions at Harvard
and Columbia have pushed their schools 
to cover 75 percent of dental premiums, 
with Columbia even establishing a sup­
port fund with more than two million 
dollars available to cover out-of-pocket 
medical, dental, and vision costs. Here 
in New Haven, Locals 34 and 35 have 
negotiated with Yale to cover 100 per­
cent of routine dental work and 80 per­
cent of emergency operations.

Other alumni also spoke about 
negative experiences with accessing
