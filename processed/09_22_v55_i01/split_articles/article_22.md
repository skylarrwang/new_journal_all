our way of life. We’re defending 
the people, our livelihood, our 
culture,” 
commented 
Lindsay 
Wheaton, the owner of the Grand 
Lake Lodge, whose wilderness 
retreat property sits facing the 
ridge lined with windmills. Other 
residents expressed concern about 
the project’s impact on the frag­
ile mountain slopes of Roxbury. It 
appears the project has been can­
celed, though no definite reason is 
given, and it is unlikely that it will 
serve as a blueprint for Yale’s energy 
production anytime soon.

Other universities on the east 
coast, a region without a bounty 
of local solar and wind farms, are 
facing similar problems in find­
ing large-scale solutions. In 2021, 
Harvard 
constructed 
a 
natural 
gas-burning cogeneration plant with 
a chic modern facade, much to the 
annoyance of climate activists. When 
I asked Cox his opinion on wind 
farms, he noted that Yale and other 
older colleges don’t yet have the infra­
structure for a large electrical grid. 
“There are options, but everything’s 
expensive,” added Gillingham. Yale’s 
sizable endowment could help develop 
these technologies, such as refitting the 
existing plants with hydrogen fuel to 
thwart emissions, utilize existing facil­
ities, and keep jobs in New Haven. 
The readiness and cost of greener 
technologies aside, it is clear that 
change is impending and Yale 
will need to do a better job informing 
its operations and attitudes with
the health and safety of surrounding 
communities.

Over the past decade, Yale 
installed geothermal-powered heat
pumps at Kroon Hall, the School 
of the Environment’s central hub. 
These pumps reach 1,600 feet 
down to Earth’s warmer core in 
order to heat water into steam. 
“Only one heat pump out of three 
really works,” said Gillingham. 
“Even if the pumps did work, they 
only provide heat, not electricity, 
so they couldn’t replace the power 
plant’s cogenerating beast.”

Yale could supplement heat 
pumps with a renewable source of 
electricity from one of their many 
pilot projects—the fleet of ten micro 
wind turbines purchased by Yale in 
2009, for example. These turbines 
sit atop Becton, an engineering and 
applied science building on campus, 
and attempt to demonstrate Yale’s 
venture into renewables. But the 
ten fans, which look like miniplane 
rotors, only provide half a percent 
of the building’s annual electricity 
needs. “As windy as it feels on Science 
Hill, it’s really not a great resource 
for producing a lot of electricity,” said 
Gillingham. 

Yale has attempted to think big­
ger by quietly investing 102 million 
dollars in a wind farm company’s proj­
ect to crown Maine’s hilltops with a 
crop of gargantuan, white windmills. 
But the approach, spearheaded by the 
late David Swensen, hasn’t run over 
smoothly with locals. “We’re defending 
need to do a better job informing 
the health and safety of surround­
ing communities. After a century 
of owning its means of energy 
production, the University still 
struggles to properly prepare for 
impending changes—caught flat­
footed when the need for transfor­
mation becomes unavoidable—or 
realize the full scope of its facilities’ 
impact on people. When a repair 
worker fell into the Central Power 
Plant’s chimney to his death in 
2015, the Yale deputy press secretary 
closed out the press release with the 
statement: “Power to campus build­
ings was not affected.”

As the University is called to par­
ticipate in the next stage of the tran­
sition to cleaner energy, the essential 
question remains: can we trust that 
Yale will use its power responsibly?

I walk back to campus from the 
corner of Congress Ave and Frontage 
Road and the power plant hums 
behind my back. Above the passing 
traffic of students and cars, vapor 
drifts from the towering exhaust pipes 
and disperses over campus. Hiding a 
beast in plain sight is no small feat, but 
Yale’s power makes it both possible 
and profitable.
