own students feel the tension between 
Yale as educator and employer. If grad­
uate student workers unionize, the 
University might become overtly cor­
porate, forfeiting its carefully crafted 
educational landscape.

“I think universities, writ large, 
need to have a serious, serious reckoning 
with what their priorities are. Because 
tuitions are going up and that’s bad for 
the students. But that money isn’t going 
to the people doing the actual teach­
ing. It’s just not. So where is the money 
going? And if it’s not going to the people 
doing the teaching, then what’s the mis­
sion of the University?” Trinh explained, 
talking faster and faster as he went. “And 
we’re starting to realize that these uni­
versities, even though they do do a lot 
of teaching and that is one of their mis­
sions, it doesn’t seem to be the primary
mission anymore.”


Others have been even more explicit 
in likening Yale to major companies.

“I think in some ways [Yale] act[s] 
just like any other corporation,” Winant 
tells me. “No corporation wants its 
workers unionized, anywhere, basically, 
ever. And we’re seeing that now, like at 
Starbucks, for example.”


Winant detailed for me the union 
busting techniques used during his 
time at Yale—from the anti-union 
lawyers in the nlrb hearings, to the 
attitudes of many professors. He 
emphasized how subtle these acts of 
deterrence could be, recounting how 
a faculty advisor had once stared and 
then scoffed at a colleague’s union 
button, which discouraged them from 
wearing it to their lab again. Since 
many graduate student workers rely on 
their professors and advisors for secur­
ing careers outside of Yale, even the 
slightest tension can feel disastrous. 
Ultimately, he noted that Yale’s aggres­
sive legal pushback to union efforts 
established a firm precedent on how 
hard they would fight a union.

“I think at some level the whole 
industry, or at least important pockets 
of the industry, are just really ideologi­
cally dug in,” Winant said.


Another dual identity

Yale isn’t the only one who struggles 
to identify graduate student work­
ers as workers—the student workers 
themselves sometimes find it difficult 
to characterize their own identities. 
Many enter graduate school conceiving 
of themselves as students alone, pas­
sionate about their academic interests 
and seeking a role in expanding their 
areas of research. When they get here 
and realize the reality of their status, 
they have to broaden their self-under­
standing as workers, too.

“When [graduate students are] 
thinking about unionizing, they’re 
making a decision about how to define 
themselves. Because they’re both emplo-
yees and these kind of apprentice profes­
sionals at the same time,” Winant said.


Organizers at the rally were con­
scious of this dynamic. The narrative of 
who a graduate student worker is and 
what they do has been re-imagined—in 
large part thanks to decades of orga­
nizing—and is reaching fruition right 
now, at Yale and across the country.

“Some of you may be uncomfort­
able with the phrase ‘student worker,’” 
English began during her speech at the 
rally. “I’ll be the first to admit that we 
are fortunate to be able to teach. But, 
that doesn’t negate the fact that what 
we are doing is labor.”


Countless graduate student work­
ers spoke about their experience work­
ing in labs, teaching in classrooms, and 
writing grants.

Out of this new working identity 
comes a unique, built-in community. 
Many alumni and current graduate 
student workers point to this commu­
nity as their favorite part of Local 33. 
“The part of the job that I enjoyed the 
most actually was just, it became kind 
of an excuse to regularly check in with 
my peers and to kind of shoot the shit 
with them,” Trinh said with the hint 
of a smile. “It became a way for me to 
discuss what was going on in their lives 
and what resources they needed.”


Now, that community is more 
vibrant than ever.

“I think the conversations have 
been easy. They have felt as if people are 
able to share their stories to folks who 


they have not ever had a chance to con­
nect with,” Rackear said. “Yale does not 
necessarily do a lot to make grad work­
ers feel as if they’re in community with 
both Yale and New Haven, and I think 
that that is something that Local 33 is 
providing. I think that that combined 
with people’s desire for things to be dif­
ferent here has been really motivating.”


Perhaps this fresh wave of organiz­
ing can be best explained by the word 
that kept cropping up in my conversa­
tions with members of Local 33: excite­
ment. When we talked on the phone 
over the summer, Liu said with a laugh, 
“We’re going to win.” 

“It’s that excitement and that 
energy. That’s where that comes from, 
from the organizing, from the work 
of talking to everyone,” Liu said, his 
words spilling out quickly as he shared 
just how special the current feeling is. 
“But when we’re going on visits and 
talking to scientists and labs and going 
to talk with humanists in libraries and 
stuff, I see it there all the time. And 
that’s something that is really mov­
ing . . . an experience of real solidarity.”


The mountain ahead

The process of change is frustrat­
ing—especially when Yale often 
refuses to allow organizers agency or 
credit for the changes that their hard 
work has actualized. Despite it all, many 
of the organizers express optimism.

“I have a lot of hope that the 
University can this time choose to do 
the right thing and acknowledge that 
we are workers and that we have the 
right to unionize and that we have the 
right to do that unimpeded,” Liu said, 
pausing to choose his words carefully. “I 
hope that they can choose not to run an 
anti-union campaign, is what I guess I’m 
saying. Because we’ve seen examples of 
employers do this, even in New Haven, 
at the Graduate Hotel downtown.”


The Graduate Hotel chose to vol­
untarily recognize and negotiate with 
its union instead of fighting through 
the legal system. unite here organiz­
ers and allies gathered in July to cele­
brate the win, praising the Graduate for 
not union busting and elevating them 
as a model for local employers.

“Graduate Hotel workers changed 
their workplace for the better, and we 
can do the same thing right here at 
Yale,” Seltzer said, as quoted by the 
New Haven Independent. ​“The Graduate 
Hotel did things right by recognizing 
the union and settling a fair contract 
quickly. It’s a shame that other employ­
ers don’t follow their lead.”


Seltzer’s call on Yale pointedly 
invokes decades of union hostility 
between graduate student workers and 
the University. And with this fresh exam­
ple of an employer remaining neutral and 
quickly settling a contract, Yale’s obsti­
nance becomes even more pronounced.

“Yale has a lot of organized power,” 
Trinh told me. “The goal of the union 
is to out-organize the University. And 
that is a very difficult task to do when 
the University has [forty] something 
billion dollars, and the graduate stu­
dents are making, what, thirty thou­
sand dollars a year. We are fighting a 
Goliath with more resources and more 
power and an absurd amount of money 
that none of us can really fathom.” 

Trinh asserts that the lack of grad­
uate student worker success is not for 
lack of trying, competency, or strategy. 
It’s the direct result of Yale’s deep-set 
resistance—fortified by its deep pock­
ets—to worker power. Organizing at 
Yale requires vast amounts of patience, 
effort, and generational knowledge—
all things that are incredibly difficult 
to build across workers who only have a 
six-to-eight year term at the University.

“That’s the hill that we’re climb­
ing,” Trinh said. “And we’re working 
on it. But we are climbing a very, very, 
very steep mountain.”


Continuing its decades-long jour­
ney to build power, Local 33 has begun 
its newest venture: signing union 
cards, which could lead to another 
formal nlrb vote or—in an unprece­
dented reversal—voluntary University 
acknowledgement. On the first day of 
September, Fields stands outside the 
Humanities Quadrangle, wearing an 
orange Local 33 shirt tucked into blue 
jeans. In front of her rests a small plas­
tic table—one of many across cam­
pus—filled with pens and paper and 
plastered with “Union Yes!” posters. 
She can’t help but smile as she tells me 
how she and her colleagues will be there 
the rest of the day, and the day after.

However long it takes.
