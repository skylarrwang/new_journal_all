HIGH TIDE

Graduate students demand
a union contract and a
more democratic university.
Will Yale listen?


**Page number(s): 11-12**

A sea of bright orange opens up below 
her, all shirts emblazoned with the 
words “Local 33 unite here,” the name 
of the union that Yale graduate student 
workers like Fields have been fighting 
to form. The crowd is with her, erupting 
into chants, cheers, and ­occasionally 
a smattering of boos aimed at Peter 
Salovey or the Yale administration.
Using a music stand as a make­
shift podium, Fields begins speaking: 
“Without my labor and that of my col­
leagues in language departments, Yale’s 
language programs would not function.”
Her words, soon drowned out by
the uproar, kick off the Union Yes 
Majority rally. It’s a demonstration cele­
brating the fact that more than 1,600

A
bigail Fields is excited. She’s not the 
only one.
The fifth-year PhD student 
in Yale’s French Department stands on 
the bed of a truck overlooking hundreds 
of protestors. It’s a chilly April evening. 


Camila 
Marcone gsd ’27 chimes in from the 
truck bed. She stands tall, wearing 
a boldly accessorized version of the 
crowd’s orange uniform—with a black 
leather jacket, red lipstick, and cat eye 
sunglasses. She tells the crowd about 
the cost of missing healthcare benefits, 
a livable wage, and a contract. “And that 
is how Yale treats us! Not even a degree 
from Yale can promise a good stable job.”
Chants soar between speeches.
Local 33 co-president Paul Seltzer gsd 
’23 leads the crowd, calling out “When 
we fight!” to a resounding, “We win!” 
The chant—carried by Seltzer’s boom­
ing voice in spite of the wind—is a 
staple of labor demonstrations around 
Yale and New Haven, spanning many 
“we”s and linking the efforts of succes­
sive generations together. 
Even more groundbreaking than 
the majority support at Yale is the 
long-building tsunami of unionization 
flooding the country, including that of 
graduate student workers at peer insti­
tutions like Brown, Harvard, MIT, 
and Columbia, who have all recently 
won recognition and contracts. Here in 
New Haven, labor activists are abuzz 
and mobilizing for change. This April 
rally includes graduate student speakers 
across departments, and representatives 
from Locals 34 and 35, the New Haven 
Board of Alders, MIT’s recently formed 
Graduate Student Union, Yale under­
graduate-run Students Unite Now (sun), 
the Graduate Hotel, and the local non­
profit New Haven Rising. Three months 
after their own Jackie Sims came to 
speak at the Local 33 rally, announcing 
the start of a union campaign, workers 
at the Graduate Hotel held elections and 
officially won their union.
“Yale better learn how to surf,” 
quips Bob Proto, President of unite 
here Local 35, which represents Yale’s 
service and maintenance workers. 
“Because there’s a wave coming on this 
campus, it’s long overdue . . . Without 
you, Yale doesn’t work.” 
The public emergence of labor 
activism—bolstered by a National Labor
Relations Board (nlrb) and a presi-
graduate student workers—a majority of 
the population of the School of Arts and 
Sciences—indicated they want a union 
at Yale. This level of support hasn’t been 
seen since early in the group’s thirty-year 
history, which has been obstructed by 
University union busting efforts.
“For too long, grad workers have 
been told that we should just feel lucky 
to be here at Yale,” genetics graduate 
student worker Arita Acharya gsd ’24 
announces to the crowd, which has 
turned to face President Salovey’s red-
bricked house on Hillhouse head-on. 
She adjusts her thin black glasses. “But 
the Yale name alone can’t pay my rent. 
It can’t heal me when I’m sick. And it 
can’t protect me from abuses of power.”
A grievance procedure. Better mental 
healthcare. Cost-of-living adjustment. 
A more democratic university. Across 
Salovey’s lawn, organizers stack huge 
cubes plastered with demands written by 
hundreds of graduate student workers.
“I want a union because if I’m 
going to be out here having kids, I can’t 
accept being treated like a kid myself,” 
At the end of August, Connecticut 
Attorney General William Tong 
officially endorsed Local 33 and
urged Yale to “commit to respecting 
[Local 33’s] rights to organize
and unionize without interference
or employer opposition,” marking
one of the most significant 
endorsements in the group’s history.
Local 35 President Bob Proto 
speaks passionately
from the bed of the truck.
