**Title: Letter from the Editors**
**Author: The Managing Board**
**Page number(s): 2**

Dear readers, 
It started with a key and a 
health hazard.
They led us to the room. A busted 
couch, some metal drawers labeled 
Biz-Nass, filing pockets we’ve since 
swapped for Google Drive folders, a 
few ancient Mac desktops, someone 
named Jessica’s to-do list, a massive 
closet of archives dating back fifty-
five years, and a wood-lacquered 
fridge filled with God-knows-what 
and God-knows-how-much black 
mold—signs of a former New Journal 
life. We burst inside, and began 
gathering scraps of editors’ past.

We could spend this whole let­
ter telling you the otherwise under­
whelming story of how The New 
Journal lost touch with its headquar­
ters for a few years. Or we could tell 
you about the hours we spent clear­
ing the room so it could be rid of its 
biohazard and reunited with us. But 
we’ll spare those details. Instead, like 
we think good journalists do, we’d 
like to focus on something more 
ambitious—the collision between 
this dusty office and the magazine 
you’re holding in your hands.

The New Journal exists with 
or without a room. For the past 
few years, it’s been spread out over 
Zoom screens, a lonely seminar 
room in Davenport College, some 
cluttered tables in Berkeley College’s 
Mendenhall room, and the apart­
ment living rooms of this Managing 
Board, where we’ve pored over 
Google Docs and diction. A mag­
azine doesn’t need a home to be 
made, maybe because it’s one of the 
most people-intensive things you 
can do, and a collection of people is 
in itself a kind of place.

But it sure is nice to have a 
place, despite all that. And what’s 
inside these pages demonstrates 
why. In Volume 55, Issue 1 of The 
New Journal, place is everywhere.

Two pieces look at the hid­
den costs of making Yale a place 
for students. Our cover story, by 
Abbey Kim, follows the graduate 
student workers whose experience 
of Yale as a workplace have long 
been invalidated by Yale’s failure to 
recognize their union, Local 33—
but that may change soon. Saachi 
Grewal tunnels through the dark 
underbelly of Yale’s power plants, 
surfacing with the realization that 
the comforts of campus we don’t 
really think about—heating, elec­
tricity—have come at an indefensi­
ble cost to not only the planet, but 
also its power plants’ employees.

In the rest of the magazine, 
you’ll find other revisitations of for­
gotten places—made all the more 
real and immortal through the phe­
nomenal visual imaginations of our 
designers and Creative Director, 
Kevin Chen. We wander backwards 
in time, into natural history muse­
ums, New Haven’s Institute Library, 
a Pac-Man machine, the Berkeley 
College Woodshop, a house sur­
rendered to a wildfire—and with 
a personal essay, at the end of the 
magazine, we go home.

Putting out a magazine is like 
jumping off a cliff you’ve run a 
marathon to get to. As it should. 
Now it’s out of our hands, and in 
yours, where it belongs. These pages 
were made to be turned, folded, 
cut-up, spilled on and stowed away 
into your rooms’ shelves, corners, 
and crevices. They’re meant to 
be forgotten, then rediscovered, 
without having to locate a key
or exterminator.

In his piece, Austin Todd urges 
us to hold on tightly, let go lightly.
He put it well. We’re letting go, and 
we’re going home.
—The Managing Board

Between the Books
N
early a decade ago, novelist and 
editor Ann Marlowe walked into 
the Institute Library on Chapel Street 
for the first time. She came in for one 
of their evening events—“probably 
one I saw in the paper,” she recalled. 
Immediately, she knew this was a spe­
cial place. Now, so many years later, 
Marlowe is still a dedicated volunteer.
Passing 
through 
the 
library’s 
wooden doors, it’s hard not to share 
Marlowe’s 
fascination. 
Near 
entrance sits a globe so old that 
Thailand is labeled “Siam.” Propped 
up on one of the shelves is a series of 
mounted insects, each painstakingly 
labeled behind a glass frame: a black 
swallowtail—Papilio polyxenes—or the 
green-clouded butterfly, Papilio troilus. 
Canoe paddles, hand-painted, hang
from the ceiling. There are ancient-
looking busts wearing surgical masks, 
an impressive vinyl collection, and 
posters boasting the subjects of some 
of the library’s most iconic evening 
workshops: Taxidermy, Theories in Time 
Travel, Ultimate Origami. 
Muted light filters through the 
windows into the front room. “This 
is the place for people who want a 
rare, quiet space,” said Jan Swiatek, 
Executive Director of the Institute 
Library. A loyal group of writers, stu­
dents, and editors frequent this private 
membership library, where it is easy to 
be inspired by its rare collections and 
rich history.
Founded in 1826, the library was 
originally called the Young Men’s 
Institute Library, and served as a center 
for academic development. “This was a 
time where you were lucky to get a fifth 
grade education from public schools,” 
explained Marlowe. 
In response, a group of men pooled 
their resources and acquired patronage 
from elders in the New Haven com­
munity to found a new library. By 1835, 
women had joined the membership, 
and a few years later, the space became 
a hub for abolitionist activity.
“In the nineteenth century, we 
were the center of intellectual ferment 
in the town,” said Marlowe. Despite 
New Haven’s conservatism at the time, 
members hosted speakers like Ralph 
Waldo Emerson, Frederick Douglass, 
and women’s rights activist Anna E. 
Dickinson.
Today, the library’s membership is 
around 220, significantly smaller than it 
was in the mid-twentieth century, when 
it peaked at around eight hundred. 
“[The library] is not a place with an 
endowment or a huge financial stream 
of resources,” said Ott. “It survived, 
all this time, without attachments to a 
patron donor. It’s always been supported 
by the community. And it’s open to all.” 
A portion of its income comes 
from annual membership fees. The 
cost starts at $30, though some choose 
to renew their fees up to $135, earning 
patron membership, to support the 
library’s mission. Only members can 
check out books, but the space is free 
for public use. 
Much of the library today remains 
just as it was in the eighteen-hun­
dreds. Maryann Ott, a member of the 
Institute Library Board, noticed this the 
first time she walked in. “Just the way it 
smelled, the way it looked, the colors, 
the books, and the people . . . I felt like I 
had been transported back in time.”
Although members like Ott are 
charmed by the library’s shabbiness, 
its age comes with challenges. Some

Points of Departure
are common issues: peeling paint and 
a leaky roof, for instance, which the 
board just received two million dol­
lars in state funding to fix, largely
to cover historical preservation costs. 
Other problems are less orthodox. 
The library uses a unique classifica­
tion system called the Borden System, 
which was created and implemented 
by the library’s first professional librar­
ian, William Alanson Borden, in 1887. 
Maintaining this esoteric categoriza­
tion is a never-ending challenge. 
“We love the Borden system be­
cause it’s ours, and it’s historic, and it 
was born here,” said Swiatek. “But flex­
ibility is not its middle name.” 
The librarians still use the original 
card catalogs to log and organize their 
thirty thousand books. In the center of 
the first floor, in a set of drawers, thou­
sands of index cards are divided into 
twenty-six base classes, each lettered a 
through z, with subjects ranging from 
“Principal Continental Literatures” to 
“Philology” to “Amusements.” 
The Borden System is less specific 
than the widely-used Dewey Decimal 
System, created by Melvil Dewey a 
decade earlier. A book in Dewey’s sys­
tem is assigned a number—741.821, 
for example. Each place value rep­
resents a category: 700 for Arts and 
Recreation, 40 for Illustration, 1 for 
Book Illustration, and so on. In Borden’s 
system, the same book might be labeled 
“J26,” with the letter representing a 
category—Fine Arts—and the num­
ber representing the subcategory—
Illustration. Unlike in Dewey’s system, 
further subcategorization is arbitrary: 
archivists often sort further using only 
a handwritten note or description. One 
index card at the library, labeled “O5,” 
includes only the name of the book, 
“Uses of Diversity,” and a bizarre col­
lection of essay titles: “Questions of 
Divorce,” “Yule Log and the Democrat,” 
“More Thoughts on Christmas.”
In 1910, Borden was enlisted by an 
Indian prince, Maharaja Sayajirao iii, 
to install his classification system in 
libraries throughout Baroda, a state of 
the British Raj located in modern-day 
Gujarat. By 1913, there were only two 
places in the world that used Borden’s 
system: the Institute Library in New 
Haven, and the public library system in 
Baroda, India.
“I have to tell you, [Borden’s] is 
not an easy system to understand,” Ott 
said. “Which is probably why Dewey’s 
won out over Borden’s.” Eventually, 
Baroda, too, switched to the Dewey 
Decimal System.
The Institute Library is less will­
ing to change. Members and volun­
teers recoil at the mention of making 
the switch. “Borden was an import­
ant librarian,” said Ott, “and [his sys­
tem] is one of the things that makes 
us unique.” Seven thousand book titles 
are digitized, but hand-written index 
cards are still the primary tools for 
finding and sorting books. Members 
like Marlowe are currently working on 
digitizing the library’s essay collection, 
though this is no small task.
“Oh, boy, would we love volunteers. 
We would be able to expand our hours,” 
Swiatek said. “And we’d love to get 
more of the books into the computer.”
A dedicated group of members, 
largely older New Haven residents and 
avid readers, liven up the library. On 
Fridays, Frank Cochrane, one of the 
library’s most active members, leads a 
weekly jazz night.
“There’s a core group that usually 
shows up…maybe fifteen to twenty 
on a busy night,” Swiatek explained. 
“[Frank] is just so knowledgeable. You 
just sit for half an hour and listen to 
him . . . This week he’s doing the early 
years of Duke Ellington.” It’s Frank’s 
personal vinyl collection that fills the 
second floor. 
At biweekly sewing socials, fashion 
designers mingle with master beaders 
and fiber artists, one of which designed 
the canoe paddles hanging in the main 
room. There are Story Nights—sort of. 
“Connecticut’s version of ‘The Moth,’” 
as Swiatek puts it—and author talks. 
On Saturdays, the art gallery on the 
second floor hosts shows. And there’s 
still more to come: when asked about 
her favorite community event, Marlowe 
grinned. “It’s still a secret,” she said—
but it’s set to begin in the fall. 
Now, reflecting on her first time 
visiting the library, Marlowe is glad she 
took a chance on the newspaper adver­
tisement almost ten years prior. 
“When I walked through the door 
I thought, ‘Oh my god, I never want to 
leave,’” she said. “And I haven’t.”

Hold On Tightly,
Let Go Lightly
T
he first thing I noticed was the 
smell. Cedar pitch, freshly sawn 
pine, and a trace of coffee from the 
manager Mark’s travel mug, steam­
ing on a countertop. The characteristic 
smells of a woodshop—to be precise, 
the Berkeley woodshop. That fall in 
2019, I spent many Saturday mornings 
working on a small table, trimming and 
planing elm boards for the surface, cut­
ting mahogany legs with a jigsaw and 
sanding them smooth. It took months 
to finish, and I was proud of it. For a 
while the table lived in my suite, but 
eventually I moved it to the Silliman 
art room, giving the still-sharp smell of 
the varnish time to air out.
For thirty years the woodshop was 
open to anyone who would wake up at 
9 a.m. on a Saturday—and many did. 
It was a small space, but efficiently laid 
out. The large table saw, the dark green 
joiner, the lathe corner and the stacks 
of various boards and plywood—some­
how none of it really got in your way. 
For almost everyone I spoke with, the 
workshop was their escape from aca­
demic pressure. Over the years, and 
with Mark’s tutelage, this hidden com­
munity created blanket chests, sparring 
dummies, conductors’ batons, coffee 
tables with inlaid chess boards, salad 
bowls, hand-turned pens—all of a qual­
ity one would have trouble attributing to 
the untrained hands of undergraduates.
“The place used to be humming,” 
Mark told me. “People coming in, having
fun, ideas on the table.”
Today, the room that once housed 
the woodshop sits nearly empty, with 
only a couple computers and a couch. 
Maybe if you’re lucky you can spot a 
bit of sawdust still nestled beneath the 
baseboards.
One evening last summer, while 
working in Berlin, I gave Mark a call. 
Ever since the start of the pandemic, 
we’ve chatted and caught up every now 
and then. We spoke for a few hours—
with one brief interruption as Mark 
greeted a prospective blueberry picker 
and directed them to the patch behind 
his house—and we discussed his retire­
ment, the projects he’s still working on, 
Berlin, and finally, the woodshop.
“Do you think it’ll ever make a 
comeback?”
“No,” he said, flippant. “I’ll put it 
this way. How many darkrooms are left 
on campus?”
The answer is not many, and access 
to those remaining is limited. Wood­
working has gone in the same direc­
tion. While there are workshops for 
wood sculpture and some facilities in 
the Center for Engineering Innovation 
and Design (ceid), these are spaces 
restricted to students in the relevant 
classes, offer little to no guidance, or 
require an obstructive amount of train­
ing. And anyway, cutting plywood 
sheets on a cnc machine feels different 
than watching wood curl away under­
neath a sharp plane.
When I ask why Mark thinks the 
woodshop closed, his voice is solemn 
but his answer’s tongue-in-cheek: “It 
was YouTube.” Students can put on a 
woodworking video and get the satis­
faction of watching someone make 
something without the trouble of actu­
ally doing it themselves. Maybe so. 
But it’d be impossible to pin down 
exactly why the woodshop closed; 
there are so many plausible reasons. 
Saws are dangerous, students are busy, 
and instant gratification really is nice!
By and large the digital age has set 
traditional woodworking on uncertain 
footing, not to mention that “Saturday 
Morning Woodshop Hobbyist” is 
hardly prime resumé material. And this 
story isn’t new: the woodshop’s popu­
larity had been waning for years before 
Covid—some Saturday mornings in 
2019 it was just the two of us, and 
maybe a friend I brought along that 
day. Teru, who was a student during 
the late nineteen-nineties, was just 
amazed the Berkeley woodshop lasted 
as long as it did. 
The story of the Berkeley woodshop 
now resembles many of the projects that 
began there. A half-turned wooden 
cup, a chess set missing everything but 
pawns, two table legs abandoned on a 
shelf. We set down our tools and things 
remain incomplete, leaving behind 
ghostly traces. Or specks of sawdust.
Yet it doesn’t all disappear: people 
got more from the shop than simply 
the satisfaction of making something 
with their hands. One woodshop alum, 
now a plastic surgeon, left Yale with 
both a rock maple trestle-style coffee 
table and one of Mark’s adages: If you 
don’t have time to do it right, you don’t 
have time to do it twice. Another told me
that whenever he sees a ginkgo tree 
or tries to touch his toes, he thinks of 
Mark and the woodshop. He and his 
wife still use a mahogany salad bowl 
that Mark turned for them as a wed­
ding gift nearly every day.
The woodshop was an imperfect 
space. It was loud, the students often 
inefficient, and when Mark describes 
himself he often favors “grumpy old 
man.” But something special wove all 
of this together, something that now 
lives in the past. I don’t mean this in a 
let’s-try-to-revive-it way. Some things 
can’t be brought back and that’s okay. 
Instead, I’m remembering a phrase 
my ceramics teacher said sometimes 
when she sold or accidentally broke her
pottery: hold on tightly, let go lightly. 
I imagine Mark driving south down
I-91, as the 8 a.m. sun peeks through 
autumn foliage, or wintry snow-laden 
branches, or the fresh leaves in spring; 
this, nearly every Saturday of every 
semester for thirty years. I imag­
ine a student finally turning a bowl 
that doesn’t crack, someone laugh­
ing from the adrenaline of cutting a 
board on the table-saw, a student tak­
ing the first seat on a lacquered chair 
they’ve been working on all semester.
I imagine Mark smiling with them.
On the phone, Mark told me that 
on every job—whether it’s building 
a kitchen or restoring a dresser—you 
always end up bleeding a little. For most 
of his career he’d wipe this inevitable bit 
of blood off. These days, he leaves it on, 
sealing it over with a layer of Shellac. 
“It’s like saying I was there.”
When I returned to campus in 
2021, the table I’d made in the wood­
shop was gone. Maybe it’s my fault for 
leaving it in the Silliman art room, but 
in any case, it’s gone, and it’s alright. 
Sometimes I show people pictures, say­
ing maybe one day it’ll show up. And 
sometimes, I call Mark and remember 
the woodshop.

Wildfire (or August 7, near
the bend on Holt Drive)
Flames devoured the hillsides, 
exhaling conical smoke lines like 
the growing plumes of an old steam 
locomotive. From the heat changes, 
a northbound wind rose, scaling the 
marsh’s cattail walls. These grasses 
shifted as one infinite and limbless 
mass. But they remained, rooted in 
that spot, under the expanding gray 
air. Another gust delivered itself 
to the marsh, and those shaking 
bulrushes smacked together with a 
seeded, vibrating crack. With each 
ensuing blow more cattails burst in 
couplets. The smoke swallowed all 
shore greenery.
In his half of the wall-split 
home off the street on Holt Drive, 
the man with a pacemaker in his 
chest waits. “I am moving to those 
foothills beyond me,” he nods. He 
palms his chest, coughs, “Yes. I will 
move to the low foothills.” Outside, 
birch leaves trembled like a thou­
sand tambourines. 
He forgets, now, to close the win­
dows. The room fills with ash flakes. 
He wipes the table to set for dinner.

T
he blue whale model loomed 
over me, the white paint of 
its belly striated by blue light. Sounds 
of ocean waves crashed and drifted 
in and out of my ears as I peered into 
each diorama of the Ocean Hall 
exhibit, longing to step inside. I closed 
my eyes—I want to stay here forever,
I thought, jetting across the sea with 
giant squids and ammonites. I was 6 
years old, and my fascination propelled 
me through every collection of the 
American Natural History Museum. 
That feeling—the intense desire to 
walk out of your own body into a world 
you can only imagine—was magic.
This is my earliest memory. At that 
age, all aspects of natural history cap­
tivated me. Dinosaurs leapt from the 
pages of books and became characters 
in a fairytale I could 
step into. I dove deep 
into the sea of natural 
history media: I spent 
hours watching documen­
taries where I saw mosa­
saurs swallow sharks whole. 
During reading periods at 
school, I’d flip through stories 
of archaeologists and paleontol­
ogists unearthing ancient civili­
zations and specimens in National 
Geographic Kids magazines, and 
I’d collect figurines of mammoths, 
saber-toothed tigers, and sau­
ropods. Other kids my age 
also let their imagination min­
gle history and nature. Some of 
my friends pretended they were 
ancient royalty, while others dug 
for fossils in the sand next to their 
castles. We saw transformation in 
everything: we watched caterpillars 
turn into butterflies, and we ran around 
the playground with arms spread 
like the wings of a monarch. As 
we got older, we shed more than 
cocoons. We let the remarkability 
of the natural world slip.
I can’t remember when I 
stopped dreaming of dinosaurs. 
My figurines are still on my book­
shelves, but that child who could 
name creatures long extinct, who 
took pride in classifying them as 
herbivores and carnivores, feels like a 
stranger. Her fantasies of swimming 
with the squids have abandoned me
—or rather, I was the one who aban­
doned them.
Trace fossils remain, reminding 
me how she lived her life devoted to 
nature and driven by curiosity. I still 
love museums and world histories, but 
natural specimens just didn’t stick. I 
don’t know why, but my world became 
far removed from trilobites and pteran­
odons. Until recently, that is.
This summer, I interned in commu­
nications at the Yale Peabody Museum 
of Natural History. As I peered through 
each of the Peabody collections—Inver­
te­brate and Ver­te­brate Paleon­tolo­gy, 
Anthro­polo­gy, 
Paleo­bo­tany, 
Ento­
mology, and the Baby­lonian Coll­
ection—I searched for objects that spoke 
to me, that I thought would catch the 
eye of online audiences on Instagram, 
Tik­Tok, and Twitter. Collection man­
agers would tell me why they mattered 
in scientific research or in distinct cul­
tural contexts, and I’d pore over books 
in Sterling Memorial Library to learn 
more. I’d look at trilobites up close in 
Invertebrate Paleontology and then 
scrounge for information about what 
the life of these distinctly-diverse and 
highly-populated arthropods were like 
before extinction. I even got to see 
the skeleton of Togo, the heroic sled 
dog of the 1925 serum run to Nome, 
Alaska, that saved many lives. My job 
was to translate these complex pieces 
of information into digestible bits for 
a broader audience on social media. In 
videos, and writing, I told the stories 
of inanimate objects and specimens in 
pursuit of the answer to the question: 
“Why do objects matter?” This ques­
tion was to be seen as the guiding point 
for each story. It is what drew me to 
the position—I heard that child’s voice 
again, telling me that it was time to lis­
ten to the millions of voices of the past.
The work was slow. Not every object 
yields an interesting story. Sometimes, 
the work meant looking at a pile of 
rocks that had been stored in cabinets 
for hundreds of years. I wished these 
fossilized creatures could whisper in my 
ear all the secrets from the generations 
of hands they have passed through—
tell me about their birth and creation, 
under what conditions they lived and 
died, or how they toiled in the myster­
ies of the natural world. There is some­
thing inexplicable and magical about 
seeing the vestiges of the past up close. 
One day, I was looking at a collection 
of cuneiform tablets in the Babylonian 
Collection. There was nothing par­
ticularly interesting about their con­
tents—just letters detailing finances to 
family members and other economical 
logistics—but within the black crevice, 
incised into the clay, was the name of 
the scribe who had crafted it. I could 
almost see the stylus touching the soft 
clay, and the tablet drying in the 
sun. I imagined it making its 
way underground, surviving 
over hundreds of years, only 
to reemerge in a small box, 
neatly tucked away inside 
a wooden cabinet in the
Yale Peabody.
Every moment spent 
in the collections is an 
intimate dance with 
curiosity. Time slows 
down so much that it begins to move 
backwards. I surrender to my curiosity, 
opening drawer after drawer, ignor­
ing the Latin names I can barely pro­
nounce. I hold dinosaur bones and 
mammoth teeth, peer into the inci­
sions made into the clay of cunei­
form tablets, and stare wide-eyed 
at jars full of maggots. I pull 
out scientific articles, and revel 
in others’ research. All this I haven’t 
had the excitement to do since I was a 
kid. And I’m able to take fragments
of the collection with me in the pieces of
information I collected along the way.
Enheduanna, an Akkadian prin­
cess and high priestess from the twen­
ty-third century bce, is known as the 
first named author in human history. 
She was a poet who wrote moving sto­
ries and incantations to the goddess 
Inanna. When I think about her writ­
ings in tandem with older pieces of the 
collection, like dinosaur bones and lit­
tle trilobites, I think about how one can 
tell the story of time that is forever roll­
ing. In my head, I swim through the 
Cambrian Explosion to the Ice Age and 
try to leap into the present, wondering 
how we got from microscopic creatures 
in the sea to prayers spelled out on clay 
tablets. These are the shifts in humanity
and in the natural world that can be 
unveiled after opening one’s mind to 
the curious life of objects. Throughout 
all this time they have remained intact. 
Regardless of their popularity, old bones
outlive us all.

Graduate students demand
a union contract and a
more democratic university.
Will Yale listen?


**Page number(s): 11-12**

A sea of bright orange opens up below 
her, all shirts emblazoned with the 
words “Local 33 unite here,” the name 
of the union that Yale graduate student 
workers like Fields have been fighting 
to form. The crowd is with her, erupting 
into chants, cheers, and ­occasionally 
a smattering of boos aimed at Peter 
Salovey or the Yale administration.
Using a music stand as a make­
shift podium, Fields begins speaking: 
“Without my labor and that of my col­
leagues in language departments, Yale’s 
language programs would not function.”
Her words, soon drowned out by
the uproar, kick off the Union Yes 
Majority rally. It’s a demonstration cele­
brating the fact that more than 1,600

A
bigail Fields is excited. She’s not the 
only one.
The fifth-year PhD student 
in Yale’s French Department stands on 
the bed of a truck overlooking hundreds 
of protestors. It’s a chilly April evening. 


Camila 
Marcone gsd ’27 chimes in from the 
truck bed. She stands tall, wearing 
a boldly accessorized version of the 
crowd’s orange uniform—with a black 
leather jacket, red lipstick, and cat eye 
sunglasses. She tells the crowd about 
the cost of missing healthcare benefits, 
a livable wage, and a contract. “And that 
is how Yale treats us! Not even a degree 
from Yale can promise a good stable job.”
Chants soar between speeches.
Local 33 co-president Paul Seltzer gsd 
’23 leads the crowd, calling out “When 
we fight!” to a resounding, “We win!” 
The chant—carried by Seltzer’s boom­
ing voice in spite of the wind—is a 
staple of labor demonstrations around 
Yale and New Haven, spanning many 
“we”s and linking the efforts of succes­
sive generations together. 
Even more groundbreaking than 
the majority support at Yale is the 
long-building tsunami of unionization 
flooding the country, including that of 
graduate student workers at peer insti­
tutions like Brown, Harvard, MIT, 
and Columbia, who have all recently 
won recognition and contracts. Here in 
New Haven, labor activists are abuzz 
and mobilizing for change. This April 
rally includes graduate student speakers 
across departments, and representatives 
from Locals 34 and 35, the New Haven 
Board of Alders, MIT’s recently formed 
Graduate Student Union, Yale under­
graduate-run Students Unite Now (sun), 
the Graduate Hotel, and the local non­
profit New Haven Rising. Three months 
after their own Jackie Sims came to 
speak at the Local 33 rally, announcing 
the start of a union campaign, workers 
at the Graduate Hotel held elections and 
officially won their union.
“Yale better learn how to surf,” 
quips Bob Proto, President of unite 
here Local 35, which represents Yale’s 
service and maintenance workers. 
“Because there’s a wave coming on this 
campus, it’s long overdue . . . Without 
you, Yale doesn’t work.” 
The public emergence of labor 
activism—bolstered by a National Labor
Relations Board (nlrb) and a presi-
graduate student workers—a majority of 
the population of the School of Arts and 
Sciences—indicated they want a union 
at Yale. This level of support hasn’t been 
seen since early in the group’s thirty-year 
history, which has been obstructed by 
University union busting efforts.
“For too long, grad workers have 
been told that we should just feel lucky 
to be here at Yale,” genetics graduate 
student worker Arita Acharya gsd ’24 
announces to the crowd, which has 
turned to face President Salovey’s red-
bricked house on Hillhouse head-on. 
She adjusts her thin black glasses. “But 
the Yale name alone can’t pay my rent. 
It can’t heal me when I’m sick. And it 
can’t protect me from abuses of power.”
A grievance procedure. Better mental 
healthcare. Cost-of-living adjustment. 
A more democratic university. Across 
Salovey’s lawn, organizers stack huge 
cubes plastered with demands written by 
hundreds of graduate student workers.
“I want a union because if I’m 
going to be out here having kids, I can’t 
accept being treated like a kid myself,” 
At the end of August, Connecticut 
Attorney General William Tong 
officially endorsed Local 33 and
urged Yale to “commit to respecting 
[Local 33’s] rights to organize
and unionize without interference
or employer opposition,” marking
one of the most significant 
endorsements in the group’s history.

dential administration that are more 
sympathetic to workers’ rights than 
their predecessors—has helped infuse 
this generation of Local 33 organizers 
with fresh enthusiasm. Organizers with 
Local 33 have helped campaign with 
New Haven Rising—a local activist 
group fighting for economic, social, and 
racial justice in New Haven—for Yale 
Respect New Haven, and this summer 
they canvassed to improve local hir­
ing practices. In Connecticut, Local 33 
has no shortage of governmental sup­
port. Like Hurt, many representatives 
from the New Haven Board of Alders, 
including its President Tyishia Walker-
Myers, attended and spoke at the rally. 
At the end of August, Connecticut 
Attorney General William Tong offi­
cially endorsed Local 33 and urged Yale 
to “commit to respecting [Local 33’s] 
rights to organize and unionize without 
interference or employer opposition,” 
marking one of the most significant 
endorsements in the group’s history.


These connections are also part 
of what makes Local 33 so unique. Its 
affiliation with unite here ties it to a 
broader network of hotel, food service, 
manufacturing, and laundry work­
ers across the country—a connection 
unlike those of the independent union 
efforts at other universities. And the 
support it has found in New Haven 
reflects the broader pro-labor senti­
ments of a city that champions workers’ 
rights and autonomy, as well as harbors 
frustrations with Yale as an employer. 
“When I come waltzing into your 
office and say, ‘hey, join the union,’ 
what I’m asking you to do is to think 
of yourself as having more in common 
with the person who cleans your office 
than with your advisor,” said Gabe 
Winant grd ’18, a former Local 33 orga­
nizer and current Assistant Professor of 
History at the University of Chicago. 
He spoke passionately and eagerly 
with me on the phone, the sounds of 
cars rushing through the background. 
“That’s one of the most amazing things 
about the organization: it actually asks 
you to think about what place you 
want to have in [New Haven], in this 
community, and the kind of complex 
and unequal social relationships that
make it up.”


Yale is no stranger to unions. The 
University already hosts five, two of 
which are affiliated with unite here—
the group behind the latest gradu­
ate student effort at Yale. However, 
the University has never acknowl­
edged Local 33—doing so would mean 
acknowledging Yale’s graduate student 
workers as actual workers, who work 
in labs, teach classes, and write grants. 
It’s a step that the administration has
historically been unwilling to take.
“I want to welcome you to the most 
unionized university in the country!” 
Proto announces to the crowd of pro­
testers, gesturing to the splendor of 
Schwarzman and Sheffield-Sterling-
Strathcona Hall behind him. “What’s 
wrong with this picture? How come 
the custodians that clean the class­
rooms have the terms of their working 
conditions in writing, and the graduate 
teachers that teach in those same class­
rooms are ignored by the University?”

A history of denial


Y
ale has long rejected the notion 
that graduate student workers 
can be anything more than students. 
“University leaders firmly believe that 
graduate students are . . . here to learn to 
be scholars and teachers,” Dean of the 
Graduate School of Arts and Sciences 
Lynn Cooley wrote in an email to me 
in July, using words to the same effect 
of all the University’s public-facing 
comments on graduate student work­
ers’ status for the past decade. “[T]heir 
curriculum includes opportunities to 
learn through instructing others.”


Graduate students, who are often 
required to work well over forty hours 
per week in order to teach classes and 
perform research, earn a stipend of 
$38,300 at Yale. There is little to no time 
for a second job, leaving these students 
overworked and underpaid—which 
Yale justifies by asserting that they are 
students, first and foremost, and stu­
dents aren’t full-time employees. To 
emphasize the labor they perform on 
campus, members of Local 33 refer to 
themselves as “graduate student work­
ers,” or even just “graduate ­workers” 
and “graduate researchers.” 


Graduate worker organizing at 
Yale has a rich history of action and 
pushback, as outlined in the Minnesota 
Review’s “On Strike at Yale,” writ­
ten by geso organizer Cynthia Young 
grd ’99. In 1971, teaching assistants 
in the Philosophy department with­
held fall semester grades to protest 
their wages—$400 per semester—and 
prompted the administration to dou­
ble TA wages. In 1986, seven teaching 
assistants formed the “TA Solidarity 
Group” to protest the poor working 
conditions at the University, which 
denied student workers health care or 
livable wages, with some workers not 
paid at all. Advised by a member of 
Local 34 who sat in on meetings, the 
group slowly grew and changed its 
name to the Graduate Employees and 
Students Organization (geso) in 1990, 
when it began seeking official union 
status. geso organized a majority of 
graduate student workers—1,400 out of 
2,200—in a series of strikes in the 1991–
1992 and 1995–1996 academic years. The 
University came down hard on organiz­
ers, threatening expulsion and holding 
disciplinary hearings that resulted in 
one teaching assistant losing her spring 
semester teaching job. Without federal 
worker status and protection, gradu­
ate student workers were left relatively 
defenseless against the University’s will 
despite widespread student support.


Insufficient labor laws and the 
precarity of relying on federal deci­
sion-making has placed graduate stu­
dent employees in a delicate position 
for much of their history. From the 
nineteen-thirties to the nineteen-
seventies, Congress frequently updated 
precarity of relying on federal
decision-making has placed graduate 
student employees in a delicate 
position for much of their history.

legislation to clarify the definition of 
workers. This trend ended with the 
1974 amendment of the National Labor 
Relations Act (nlra) to protect hospital 
and nursing home healthcare workers as 
worker rights were becoming increas­
ingly politicized. The original nlra law, 
passed in 1935, provided private-sector 
workers the rights to organize, seek bet­
ter working conditions, and represent 
themselves without fear of retaliation. 
After the 1974 amendment, matters of 
worker status, the right to organize, and 
collective bargaining fell into the hands 
of the National Labor Relations Board 
(­nlrb)—a federal agency governed by 
five President-appointed board mem­
bers, which primarily acts as a judicial 
body to decide private sector cases. 
These cases allow the Board to estab­
lish or curtail worker rights, the most 
controversial of which could then be 
reversed by subsequent board members. 
In 2000, the Clinton-led nlrb 
ruled to grant worker status, and thus 
protection of the nlra, to graduate 
student workers at private universities. 
Because the nlra protections do not 
apply to government employees, gradu­
ate student workers at public universities 
are exempt altogether, leaving individ­
ual states with the ability to determine 
workers’ rights to organize. But even 
graduate student workers at private uni­
versities soon lost their protections, as 
the decision was overturned and reversed 
by the Bush-appointed board in 2004.


In August of 2016, the Obama-
appointed nlrb re-affirmed that stu­
dent employees at private universities 
held the right to unionize. On the day 
of the decision, President Salovey sent a 
letter to the Yale community expressing 
his disagreement: unionizing, he said, 
would tarnish teacher-student relation­
ships with a “formal collective bargain­
ing regime.” Yale has continued to deny 
its student workers employee status. 
“Their opposition to the union was 
economic. They didn’t want to pay us 
more money, I’m sure,” Winant said. 
“But more than that, it was ideological. 
And that was why they fought so hard.”


Winant helped spearhead the last 
major push for a union during his final 
years at Yale, in 2016 and 2017. After 
the 2016 nlrb ruling, Local 33 quickly 
filed with the nlrb for a vote of legit­
imacy, pursuing departmental voting 
(a “micro-unit” strategy) as opposed to 
a simple majority. This strategy meant 
only a handful of departments—all of 
which had strong Local 33 support—
would proceed with official elections, 
with the hope of winning a union that 
would represent each individual depart­
ment rather than the entire graduate 
student body. The decision was con­
troversial, and the University publicly 
accused Local 33 of voter suppression as 
well as aggressive recruiting tactics. 
“When you organize workers or 
a group of people, the goal is to build 
power . . . you want to build enough 
power to protect the membership, to 
protect the workers,” Viet Trinh grd 
’18, a former Local 33 organizer, said 
after pausing for a moment. “In order 
to build power, you need to win.”


That power was tested when the
University took Local 33—then geso

—to court in the fall of 2016. Yale 
asserted that graduate students were 
not workers—an ideological position 
in direct violation of the nlrb rul­
ing—and that departmental elections 
should not be allowed. The University 
hired Proskauer Rose llp, a New York 
City-based law firm notorious for 
union-busting that has fought against 
workers at Volkswagen, players in the 
nfl, nba and nhl, and, most recently, 
technology and product staffers at The 
New York Times. 

What should have been a routine 
hearing, culminating in the dismissal 
of Yale’s case, ended up lasting around 
two months. Winant attributed this 
delay largely to the University slow­
ing down proceedings by deliberately 
submitting paperwork incorrectly or 
requesting additional hearings on triv­
ial matters, a tactic “universal to union 
busting” to demoralize and frustrate 
union organizers.

Ultimately, the judge ruled in 
favor of Local 33. The group held elec­
tions in nine of the Graduate School 
departments in February of 2017, win­
ning in eight of them. Yale appealed 
the hearing’s results, forcing a sec­
ond legal battle. Between the initial 
hearings and the election, Trump was 
elected president, forcing Local 33 
organizers to prepare for an anti-labor 
administration that could reverse the 
2016 nlrb decision granting graduate 
student workers the right to unionize.

In hopes of forcing Yale to nego­
tiate, and calling attention to the 
University’s strategic stalling of delib­
erations so that they would carry over 
into Trump’s term, Local 33 members 
turned to demonstration. They held 
rallies during a weeks-long hunger 
strike, with several demonstrators 
requiring wheelchairs due to complete 
exhaustion, and occupied Beinecke 
Plaza with an encampment—dubbed 
33 Wall Street—sporting picnic tables, 
electrical lighting, and bookcases full 
of board games, history textbooks, and 
political nonfiction.

Ultimately, the fight for formal 
recognition was unsuccessful. In the 
summer of 2017, Yale’s Local 33 orga­
nizers made the painful decision to 
withdraw their petitions from the nlrb, 
alongside other graduate student work­
ers at Boston College and the University 
of Chicago. The organizers feared a 
hostile Trump-appointed nlrb could 
use any one of their cases as an excuse 
to overturn the 2016 decision and revoke 
graduate student workers’ right to 
unionize across the country. They hoped 
for their right to organize to continue 
existing, to get through the next four 
years, and to eventually restart the for­
mal recognition process, post-Trump.

Finding agency
“I 
think one of the things that’s pretty 
remarkable is just how constant 
some of the things are,” Ridge Liu, 
Co-President of Local 33 and fifth-year 
PhD student in the physics department, 
told me. Liu explained that, through­
out his entire time at Yale, people have 
talked about the same issues—lack 
of a third party grievance procedure, 
good mental healthcare, support for 
international students. Without a union,
he believes these problems will con­
tinue to haunt future generations of
graduate workers.

Liu began his time at Yale in 2018, 
during the Trump administration, on 
the heels of Local 33’s defeat in gain­
ing union status. He recalls the end of 
his first year culminating in “A Failure 
to Commit,” a report holding the 
University accountable for its failure to 
deliver on promises of hiring more New 
Haven residents, as well as recruiting 
more faculty of color. The report under­
scored that without formal account­
ability methods—like a unionized 
staff—Yale would continue to violate 
its espoused values of diversity, equity, 
and inclusion behind closed doors.

Today, organizers with Local 33,
Locals 34 and 35, and other New Haven 
organizations like New Haven Rising 
have continued to press Yale to expand 
their local hiring practices and con­
tributions to New Haven. Many hope 
Local 33 could push Yale to increase 
its financial support of New Haven, 
provide a higher baseline support for 
all of its workers, and truly commit to 
diversity in hiring goals.

“A union would also give us the 
power to hold Yale accountable and 
make this a university that doesn’t just 
talk about lofty goals of bettering the 
world but makes real, material commit­
ments to the New Haven community 
that supports and surrounds it,” Micah 
English gsd ’26, a PhD student in the 
Political Science Department, said at 
the rally, peering out at the crowd in 
front of her from beneath her brown 
knitted bucket hat. She highlighted 
research demonstrating that unions 
help foster racial solidarity and increase 
feelings of belonging. “As members of 
the Yale community, we should do all 
we can to ensure Yale is living up to its 
stated value of justice and fair opportu­
nities for all.”

A union, English said, could help 
formally enact protections for gradu­
ate student workers by establishing a 
grievance procedure. Currently, issues 
that arise in the workplace have to be 
taken up with supervisors—including 
grievances caused by their own supervi­
sors. An independent third party could 
receive those complaints and handle 
them without bias. Local 33 members 
tout neutral third party arbitration, 
along with increased inclusion and 
diversity, as possibilities enabled by a 
union contract.

“Autonomy in the workplace is 
one good, important issue, but broader 
welfare practices and safety nets are 
important for any sort of worker, 
including graduate students who are 
teaching and doing research,” Mustafa 
Yavas grd ’20, a Local 33 alum and 
postdoctoral associate in the nyu Abu 
Dhabi sociology department, told me 
in a voice memo in April. 

These demands are not abstractions 
for the Local 33 organizers, but every­
day realities born from lived experience. 
Liu came to Yale to study theoreti­
cal particle physics, a branch of phys­
ics that examines the components of 
the universe in their most basic forms. 
But at the beginning of the pandemic, 
Local 33 Co-President
Paul Seltzer leads the group 
in chants as they march 
up Hillhouse Avenue to 
President Salovey’s house.


funding uncertainties and the diffi­
culty of working online forced Liu out 
of his research group. He now studies 
subatomic particles called neutrinos 
with an experimental particle physics 
group, expressing that even though he 
enjoys this group, he’s frustrated that 
Yale pulled back on his original group’s 
funding in a year where their endow­
ment grew by billions of dollars. 

“We need a contract. We don’t 
have a document that lays out: here’s 
the conditions of our work; here’s what 
you get for doing this work. If things 
go wrong, here is a process that you 
can trust that will…get a resolution 
for you,” Liu explains. “None of those 
things are codified in a way that is 
binding and that we as graduate work­
ers really have a way to be at the table.”

Liu’s co-president, Seltzer, who 
works in the history department, shared 
his experience with lack of agency 
at the April rally: “We’ve taught in 
crowded, poorly ventilated rooms with 
no guarantee of high quality masks and 
no consistent policies for what happens 
if we or our students get Covid. I need 
a union because I need a say in the basic 
conditions of the work that I do.”

An unhealthy relationship
T
he pandemic forced another of 
Yale’s shortcomings into the spot­
light: healthcare. From big picture issues 
like mental health coverage, expensive 
dental and visual premiums, to the day-
to-day safety conditions of the labs they 
work in, graduate student workers are 
finding themselves left unattended by 
the institution they work for. 

Expensive healthcare premiums 
exist on top of substantial out-of-pocket 
costs. Buğra Şahin, an international stu­
dent and third year in the Chemical and 
Environmental Engineering depart-
ment, recounted paying $3,000—about 
8 percent of his yearly salary—out of 
pocket for a medically necessary dental 
procedure last year, leaving him living 
paycheck to paycheck. 

When he spoke at the rally, Şahin’s 
voice was full of passion, reach­
ing a firm, forceful crescendo at his 
conclusion: “To be able to flourish and 
excel in our work that we do for Yale, 
mind you, we have to have our basic 
healthcare needs met,” Şahin said.

Local 33 alum Yavas remembered 
the lack of dental and vision coverage 
from his time at Yale, adding, “It’s 
obscene that dental care and eye care is 
still not included in the graduate stu­
dent healthcare package, as if our eyes 
and our teeth are not part of our bodies 
or health.” No changes to the current 
healthcare plan have been reported as 
of the start of the 2022 academic year.

Graduate worker unions at Harvard
and Columbia have pushed their schools 
to cover 75 percent of dental premiums, 
with Columbia even establishing a sup­
port fund with more than two million 
dollars available to cover out-of-pocket 
medical, dental, and vision costs. Here 
in New Haven, Locals 34 and 35 have 
negotiated with Yale to cover 100 per­
cent of routine dental work and 80 per­
cent of emergency operations.

Other alumni also spoke about 
negative experiences with accessing

healthcare at Yale. Trinh found him­
self unable to get a medicine he’d been 
taking for six years twice throughout 
his first three years at Yale. After sev­
eral attempts to make an appointment, 
Trinh gave up trying. “I think I was one 
of those folks who kind of fell through 
the cracks of Yale Health.”


If there are cracks in Yale’s gen­
eral health system, then its Mental 
Health & Counseling department has 
chasms. Alumni and current gradu­
ate student workers alike recounted 
experiences with long wait times, 
short treatment windows, and poorly 
matched therapists.


“It’s an incredibly opaque system 
that requires an absurd amount of work 
on the part of people who need help,” 
Trinh said. “It seems set up to aggravate 
the very kind of conditions that health­
care is supposed to treat . . . I think we 
see the failures of that system reflected 
in—if I can be frank—the poor mental 
health outcomes of Yale students, both 
graduate and undergraduate.”


Others, like Winant, voiced their 
experiences of feeling misunderstood 
by healthcare professionals who had 
mainly been trained to deal with 18- 
and 19-year-old college students. “I felt 
like we were just getting processed and 
pushed through,” Winant said.


In a mental health system known 
for relegating all it serves to long wait 
times and dissatisfactory treatment ser­
vices, graduate student workers bear 
the brunt of the obstacles. Some prog­
ress may happen soon—Dean Cooley 
wrote to me that, in response to a push 
by the Graduate School Assembly, she 
anticipates a “gsas-specific embed­
ded mental health counselor” will be 
in place by Fall 2022—but, for many 
graduate student workers whose mental 
health needs have been long ignored, 
this comes too little, too late.


Paying the price

I
n addition to pointing out the need for 
safer working environments, Local 
33’s requests for contracts and better 
healthcare reveal the deeper economic 
precarity facing many graduate student 
workers. This starts, quite simply, with 
the salary Yale pays its student workers.


“The salary that Yale pays its grad­
uate students is no longer competitive 
in the way that it would’ve been, for 
instance, a decade ago,” Trinh told me 
over Zoom in April. The impact of this 
discrepancy, he noted, is much bigger 
than graduate students—it hurts the 
University, graduate student workers, 
and undergraduates alike when they 
“have to be taught by people who are 
worried about where their next pay­
check is going to come from.”


The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 
estimated the average wage for a “post­
secondary 
teaching 
assistant”—the 
best fit category for a graduate stu­
dent worker—was $41,170 in May 2021. 
Stipends in Yale’s Graduate School 
were recently raised and now range 
from $38,300 to $40,000—well below 
the national average, despite coming 
from one of the wealthiest universi­
ties in the world. While students can 
request additional family subsidies if 
they plan on expanding their families,

“And we’re starting to realize 
that these universities, even 
though they do do a lot of 
teaching and that is one of their 
missions, it doesn’t seem to be 
the primary mission anymore.”

or medical leave funds and conference 
fellowship funds, all of these require 
extra criteria and are not a baseline 
need met by the University. Graduate 
worker pay at peer unionized univer­
sities like Columbia, Harvard, and 
Brown is significantly higher—with 
minimum PhD pay at Brown resting at 
$42,411 per year, 10 percent more than 
Yale’s $38,300 despite Brown’s endow­
ment being $35.4 billion less.


“I think the big dirty secret of 
academia is that graduate student 
instructors—including at Yale—do a 
significant plurality of the teaching, 
if not the majority of the teaching,” 
Trinh said. “And the truth is that part 
of the way that these universities bal­
ance their books and make a profit is by 
underpaying us. That’s part of the cal­
culus they make.”


This calculus is being felt, hard, by 
graduate student workers, particularly 
amid the current period of inflation 
and rising rent prices.


“Rent has gone up,” Liu said over 
the summer. “People are really feeling 
the stakes of what’s going on and of our 
lack of power in the University.”


The New Haven Register reported 
that rent has climbed by about 25 per­
cent in New Haven in the past year. 
The average rent for a one-bedroom 
apartment in New Haven is $1,895 per 
month. Annually, this would cost grad­
uate student workers around $22,000—
about 60 percent of their salaries from 
Yale. Average rent is 32 percent of the 
typical Americans’ pay, according to 
Business Insider, and financial experts 
recommend keeping monthly housing 
costs at less than 30 percent of income. 
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor 
Statistics Consumer Expenditure Data 
from 2020, adding up the spending 
of an average American on only a few 
necessities—rent, transportation, and 
food—totals to $39,142, more than a 
thousand more than a base graduate 
worker salary.


Anti-union pundits often portray 
graduate student workers as ungrateful 
ivory tower elites, but many students 
are pushing back against this narrative.


“I come from a working class fam­
ily,” Madison Rackear, a fourth-year 
PhD student in the genetics depart­
ment, told me over the summer. “I was 
the first in my family to go to college. 
I do have student debt . . . moving to 
New Haven was a really big jump for 
me. I came straight from undergrad, 
and it required a lot of money and time 
and resources that were, I think, very 
stressful to me at that time. And I 
kind of came into New Haven feeling 
already as if Yale was not doing its due 
diligence to support graduate workers 
that it was recruiting to the area.”


Rackear went on to explain how 
they first worked in a lab at University 
of North Carolina, Chapel Hill in 
order to make money to stay on campus 
over the summer. After that, Rackear 
applied to graduate school knowing 
that a PhD in genetics would secure 
them more financial security, even if 
they weren’t planning on staying in 
academia.


“It really just allows certain doors 
to be open that are otherwise not in 



21
this field,” Rackear said. “So I went 
under the guise of some sort of finan­
cial security, and then unfortunately I 
think I quickly realized that that comes 
at the cost of a shorter period of finan­
cial instability for a lot of graduate 
workers, myself included.”


Local 33 alumnus Winant describes 
his own version of this “bargain”—
trading long-term financial security for 
short-term financial insecurity—which 
broke down when he arrived on cam­
pus in the fall of 2010.


“The academic job market was in 
really bad shape,” Winant said, adding 
that the “rough, impoverished seven 
years” of PhD work no longer trans­
lated to getting a high-paying job. “So 
it seemed to me like more power for 
people at the bottom end of the system 
seemed important if we’re gonna figure 
out how to renegotiate that bargain in 
some kind of way.”


The decline of stable, well-paying 
job opportunities for PhD students is 
not merely a historical phenomenon; 
it is very much a challenge of today. 
In 1995, roughly half of those teaching 
at colleges were tenured or on track 
to get it, as reported by The New York 
Times. Twenty-five years later, in 2020, 
a study by the American Association of 
University Professors found that only 
31 percent of American college faculty 
members were tenured or eligible for 
tenure. These numbers indicate the rise 
of contingent faculty—a class of faculty 
with lower pay, less job security, and less 
academic clout—who allow universities 
to balance their books and maintain 
large enrollment numbers. Since the 
majority of academic workers will end 
up in these precarious jobs, more grad­
uate student workers than ever before 
are fighting for a smaller pool of stable, 
tenure-track spots.


In 2014, after months of protests, 
open letters, and articles by Local 33 
organizers, the University rolled out 
an automatic, six-year funding plan 
in the humanities and social sciences. 
But Winant noted that the University 
framed it as an independently-driven, 
internal decision.


“They don’t want to convey to 
people that they’re participating in a 
kind of negotiating process,” Winant 
explained. “They want to have monop­
olized decision making.”


According to Winant, the role 
of graduate student workers was to 
generate pressure through petitions, 
open letters, demonstrations, and fac­
ulty conversations, which would then 
be passed up to the administration. 
The University would never negotiate 
openly with Local 33 because doing 
so would confer recognition, allowing 
graduate workers collective bargain­
ing power, increased autonomy, and 
the potential for even bigger change—
supported by legal protections.


Yale’s existential crisis

Y
ale is part corporation, part school. 
Navigating graduate student work­
ers’ search for worker recognition exac­
erbates its identity crisis. The question 
of Local 33’s status brings Yale’s dual­
ism to an unsettling head—forcing 
the University to admit that even its 
Cubes plastered with union 
demands stack high in front 
of President Salovey’s house, 
nearly obscuring it from view.

own students feel the tension between 
Yale as educator and employer. If grad­
uate student workers unionize, the 
University might become overtly cor­
porate, forfeiting its carefully crafted 
educational landscape.

“I think universities, writ large, 
need to have a serious, serious reckoning 
with what their priorities are. Because 
tuitions are going up and that’s bad for 
the students. But that money isn’t going 
to the people doing the actual teach­
ing. It’s just not. So where is the money 
going? And if it’s not going to the people 
doing the teaching, then what’s the mis­
sion of the University?” Trinh explained, 
talking faster and faster as he went. “And 
we’re starting to realize that these uni­
versities, even though they do do a lot 
of teaching and that is one of their mis­
sions, it doesn’t seem to be the primary
mission anymore.”


Others have been even more explicit 
in likening Yale to major companies.

“I think in some ways [Yale] act[s] 
just like any other corporation,” Winant 
tells me. “No corporation wants its 
workers unionized, anywhere, basically, 
ever. And we’re seeing that now, like at 
Starbucks, for example.”


Winant detailed for me the union 
busting techniques used during his 
time at Yale—from the anti-union 
lawyers in the nlrb hearings, to the 
attitudes of many professors. He 
emphasized how subtle these acts of 
deterrence could be, recounting how 
a faculty advisor had once stared and 
then scoffed at a colleague’s union 
button, which discouraged them from 
wearing it to their lab again. Since 
many graduate student workers rely on 
their professors and advisors for secur­
ing careers outside of Yale, even the 
slightest tension can feel disastrous. 
Ultimately, he noted that Yale’s aggres­
sive legal pushback to union efforts 
established a firm precedent on how 
hard they would fight a union.

“I think at some level the whole 
industry, or at least important pockets 
of the industry, are just really ideologi­
cally dug in,” Winant said.


Another dual identity

Yale isn’t the only one who struggles 
to identify graduate student work­
ers as workers—the student workers 
themselves sometimes find it difficult 
to characterize their own identities. 
Many enter graduate school conceiving 
of themselves as students alone, pas­
sionate about their academic interests 
and seeking a role in expanding their 
areas of research. When they get here 
and realize the reality of their status, 
they have to broaden their self-under­
standing as workers, too.

“When [graduate students are] 
thinking about unionizing, they’re 
making a decision about how to define 
themselves. Because they’re both emplo-
yees and these kind of apprentice profes­
sionals at the same time,” Winant said.


Organizers at the rally were con­
scious of this dynamic. The narrative of 
who a graduate student worker is and 
what they do has been re-imagined—in 
large part thanks to decades of orga­
nizing—and is reaching fruition right 
now, at Yale and across the country.

“Some of you may be uncomfort­
able with the phrase ‘student worker,’” 
English began during her speech at the 
rally. “I’ll be the first to admit that we 
are fortunate to be able to teach. But, 
that doesn’t negate the fact that what 
we are doing is labor.”


Countless graduate student work­
ers spoke about their experience work­
ing in labs, teaching in classrooms, and 
writing grants.

Out of this new working identity 
comes a unique, built-in community. 
Many alumni and current graduate 
student workers point to this commu­
nity as their favorite part of Local 33. 
“The part of the job that I enjoyed the 
most actually was just, it became kind 
of an excuse to regularly check in with 
my peers and to kind of shoot the shit 
with them,” Trinh said with the hint 
of a smile. “It became a way for me to 
discuss what was going on in their lives 
and what resources they needed.”


Now, that community is more 
vibrant than ever.

“I think the conversations have 
been easy. They have felt as if people are 
able to share their stories to folks who 


they have not ever had a chance to con­
nect with,” Rackear said. “Yale does not 
necessarily do a lot to make grad work­
ers feel as if they’re in community with 
both Yale and New Haven, and I think 
that that is something that Local 33 is 
providing. I think that that combined 
with people’s desire for things to be dif­
ferent here has been really motivating.”


Perhaps this fresh wave of organiz­
ing can be best explained by the word 
that kept cropping up in my conversa­
tions with members of Local 33: excite­
ment. When we talked on the phone 
over the summer, Liu said with a laugh, 
“We’re going to win.” 

“It’s that excitement and that 
energy. That’s where that comes from, 
from the organizing, from the work 
of talking to everyone,” Liu said, his 
words spilling out quickly as he shared 
just how special the current feeling is. 
“But when we’re going on visits and 
talking to scientists and labs and going 
to talk with humanists in libraries and 
stuff, I see it there all the time. And 
that’s something that is really mov­
ing . . . an experience of real solidarity.”


The mountain ahead

The process of change is frustrat­
ing—especially when Yale often 
refuses to allow organizers agency or 
credit for the changes that their hard 
work has actualized. Despite it all, many 
of the organizers express optimism.

“I have a lot of hope that the 
University can this time choose to do 
the right thing and acknowledge that 
we are workers and that we have the 
right to unionize and that we have the 
right to do that unimpeded,” Liu said, 
pausing to choose his words carefully. “I 
hope that they can choose not to run an 
anti-union campaign, is what I guess I’m 
saying. Because we’ve seen examples of 
employers do this, even in New Haven, 
at the Graduate Hotel downtown.”


The Graduate Hotel chose to vol­
untarily recognize and negotiate with 
its union instead of fighting through 
the legal system. unite here organiz­
ers and allies gathered in July to cele­
brate the win, praising the Graduate for 
not union busting and elevating them 
as a model for local employers.

“Graduate Hotel workers changed 
their workplace for the better, and we 
can do the same thing right here at 
Yale,” Seltzer said, as quoted by the 
New Haven Independent. ​“The Graduate 
Hotel did things right by recognizing 
the union and settling a fair contract 
quickly. It’s a shame that other employ­
ers don’t follow their lead.”


Seltzer’s call on Yale pointedly 
invokes decades of union hostility 
between graduate student workers and 
the University. And with this fresh exam­
ple of an employer remaining neutral and 
quickly settling a contract, Yale’s obsti­
nance becomes even more pronounced.

“Yale has a lot of organized power,” 
Trinh told me. “The goal of the union 
is to out-organize the University. And 
that is a very difficult task to do when 
the University has [forty] something 
billion dollars, and the graduate stu­
dents are making, what, thirty thou­
sand dollars a year. We are fighting a 
Goliath with more resources and more 
power and an absurd amount of money 
that none of us can really fathom.” 

Trinh asserts that the lack of grad­
uate student worker success is not for 
lack of trying, competency, or strategy. 
It’s the direct result of Yale’s deep-set 
resistance—fortified by its deep pock­
ets—to worker power. Organizing at 
Yale requires vast amounts of patience, 
effort, and generational knowledge—
all things that are incredibly difficult 
to build across workers who only have a 
six-to-eight year term at the University.

“That’s the hill that we’re climb­
ing,” Trinh said. “And we’re working 
on it. But we are climbing a very, very, 
very steep mountain.”


Continuing its decades-long jour­
ney to build power, Local 33 has begun 
its newest venture: signing union 
cards, which could lead to another 
formal nlrb vote or—in an unprece­
dented reversal—voluntary University 
acknowledgement. On the first day of 
September, Fields stands outside the 
Humanities Quadrangle, wearing an 
orange Local 33 shirt tucked into blue 
jeans. In front of her rests a small plas­
tic table—one of many across cam­
pus—filled with pens and paper and 
plastered with “Union Yes!” posters. 
She can’t help but smile as she tells me 
how she and her colleagues will be there 
the rest of the day, and the day after.

However long it takes.

The Sterling Plant powers
the Yale School of Medicine 
and the Hospital. It’s one of two 
plants on Yale’s campus, the other 
being the Central Power Plant 
that operates on Grove Street. 
They’re easy to miss: neither is 
marked with signposts nor touted 
from the outside for powering the 
University. Cox told me about the 
University of Alaska adding a light 
show with their school’s colors to 
their power plant, but Yale seems 
intent on keeping its plants hidden 
from the public eye.


With revamped exteriors, it 
is difficult to tell that the Central 
Power Plant and Sterling Power 
Plant were built in 1918 and 1923, 
respectively. But on cold days, the 
steam pouring from the gothic-style 
exhaust stacks resembles the ashen 
clouds of a coal-fired plant, a scene 
straight out of a photograph of early 
industrial America. The plants’ unas­
suming appearance conceals a history 
of harmful practices from the pass­
erby’s eye—a legacy of slow-paced 
improvement, of Yale disregarding 
employee health and student wellbe­
ing, swept into coal-dusted shadows.


The Endowment Justice 
Coalition publicized the extent 
of Yale’s investments in fossil 
fuels in 2021—an estimated 800 
million to 2.5 billion dollars; it’s 
hard to know for sure due to a 
lack of transparency. Unlike 
Yale’s 
investment 
practices, 
the power plants haven’t been 
held to the same level of scru­
tiny. While the full tale of Yale’s 
energy infrastructure can only be 
traced through obscure finan­
cial documentation and lessons 
in thermodynamics, the conse­
quences are tangible to us all, 
even if they’re easy to ignore—flip 
the light switch or turn on the hot 
water, and you’re consuming fos­
sil fuels. As universities across the 
country are forced to reckon with 
global calls for cleaner energy gen­
eration, Yale will have no choice 
but to reconsider its priorities and 
role as a research university, not a 
hedge fund with a school attached.


If the power plants tell us one 
thing, it is that transformations in 
Yale’s energy infrastructure aren’t 
simple, fast, or necessarily effec­
tive. Yale’s energy history—from 
the first, cursory dappling of coal-
fired plants to modern renewables 
projects—is patched together with 
stories of belated improvement 
and myopic preparation, especially 
to the impact their efforts have on 
surrounding communities. We now 
stand on the cusp of yet another 
inflection point in energy history. 
As we once again entrust Yale to 
responsibly steward an update of 
on-campus energy infrastructure, 
it is more important than ever to 
understand the full scope of power 
the University possesses when it 
comes to energy production, how 
it’s leveraged that power in the past, 
and the human consequences that 
are too often taken as secondary to
“progress.” There may be no better way 
to do so than to look to the exhaust 
pipes of the Yale power plants.


Early in Yale’s history, the Univer­
sity’s method of generating electricity 
frustrated campus residents. Before the 
Central Power Plant was constructed, 
several smaller plants burned coal to heat 
and light buildings. These plants—scat­
tered near classrooms and below dining 
halls—left campus cloaked in black soot. 
Yale paid little attention 
to complaints as the issue of 
coal ash lingering near living 
spaces became exacerbated in 
the 1910s. Students and fac­
ulty were at risk of incurring 
chronic respiratory irritation 
and exposure to a rank, sulfu­
rous compound that burnt coal 
releases. “The value of the plant 
from a hygienic standpoint can­
not be computed in dollars and 
cents,” a 1911 Yale Daily News 
article reads. “Pure air in our 
dormitories and lecture rooms 
is a consideration not to be for­
gotten.” It was only when the 
University planned on expanding 
its operations with the construc­
tion of a new dormitory that the 
inefficient system of the smaller 
plants was called into question. 
Donations eventually enabled the 
construction of the Central Power 
Plant in 1918, a symbol of Yale’s 
self-sustainability, and its grow­
ing power as an institution.

In addition to spewing 
noxious coal dust around 
campus, the new plant threat­
ened the safety of its workers 
attending to the outsized oper­
ations, driving employees to 
strike for higher pay in 1941. 
“They had the proverbial coal 
man working then who would 
shovel coal into the furnace,” 
said Cox, “They were constantly 
breathing in that coal dust.” 
The coal dust particles, smaller 
than one-thirtieth the width of 
a human hair, meander into the 
lungs and bloodstream where 
they can cause a host of chronic 
lung, heart, brain, and ner­
vous system diseases. The plant 
clearly wasn’t built to address 
the concerns about student or 
employee health.


As we walked through 
the power plant’s underbelly, 
Cox mentioned that he had 
worked in a coal-fired plant for 
a short while, prior to his job at 
Yale. Running his hands along 
some pipes sealed with nuts 
and bolts, he said, “If the seals 
weren’t perfect, I would breathe 
in all these coal particles—I’m 
healthy now, but who knows 
what I might come down with 
in the future.”


Cox showed me the old 
furnace, power washed but still 
stained with a black hue. His 
flashlight illuminated a mum­
mified pigeon at the bottom of 
the cavern and we lingered there, 
silent, in the macabre scene. 
“Sometimes I wish I could see 
what it was really like back then,” 
he said, before being interrupted 
by his cell phone’s ringtone: the 
sound of a Star Wars lightsaber 
unsheathing.


In the 1940s, Yale’s Central 
and Sterling plants burned through
35,000 to 40,000 tons of coal 
annually, the weight of the Statue 
of Liberty. A Yale Daily News arti­
cle from 1953 describes how the 
clock hands of Harkness Tower 
were barely visible through the 
power plant “smaze”—a mixture of 
smog and haze spewed by the 
plants’ smokestacks. 


From the 1940s to the early 
2000s, Yale consistently strug­
gled to meet Connecticut’s 
baseline air pollution regula­
tions. Yale attempted to clean 
up its act by weaning off coal, 
but in doing so became com­
pletely reliant on natural gas, a 
colorless and odorless fossil fuel 
that was burned alongside coal 
in the plants since the 1910s. In 
the 1960s, Yale managed to cut 
its power demands by 10%, and in 
the decades after tweaked existing 
machinery to further lower emis­
sions. But, by 1992, Yale’s Senior 
Energy 
and 
Environmental 
Engineer declared that the plants 
were still not meeting the state’s air 
pollution standards. 


Yale’s slow progress isn’t nec­
essarily surprising. It’s risky for a 
campus to experiment with new 
energy technologies. Lab spaces, 
classrooms, and dorms could all 
go dark without large, consis­
tent stocks of energy, which is not 
something the University would 
leave to chance. Even during short 
outages caused by union strikes 
in the 1950s, campus life was dis­
rupted as undergraduates took up 
maintenance duties on campus. It

wasn’t until 2007—when Yale 
replaced old machinery with 
a turbine able to concurrently 
produce hot steam and elec­
tricity, a setup called cogenera­
tion—that Yale met state codes. 
The cogeneration setup is im-
pressive to behold: studded with 
windows revealing hot blue gas, it 
spans the length of a large bus. I 
don a hard hat and earplugs before 
Cox leads me to the gas turbine 
and opens the metal double doors. 
Out belches ­oil-smelling fumes 
and a booming clamor that sounds 
like a plane continuously taking 
off. “It’s like a big gas-powered grill 
on its side attached to a jet turbine 
engine,” yells Cox.


Cogeneration was the main 
cause of the 43 percent reduction 
of Yale’s greenhouse gas emissions 
from 2005 to 2020. In a typical 
power generator, heated steam spins 
a large fan-like turbine and exits 
the smokestacks in 1200°F plumes. 
Cogeneration captures the warm 
steam, recycling its energy before 
letting out a cooler 300°F stream 
through the pipes. Yet, the technol­
ogy isn’t revolutionary. Cogeneration 
first appeared in early 20th century 
American power plants and was only 
adopted in industrial plants after it 
was promoted as an energy-efficient 
technology in the 1978 purpa act. 
Yale adopted the technology around 
the time other American universities 
got on the bandwagon.


Each year, the exhaust pipes still 
release 198,000 metric tons of green­
house gasses, the weight of the Sears 
Tower. “Natural gas is not the pana­
cea,” stressed Kenneth Gillingham, 
Professor of Economics at the Yale 
School of the Environment. 


If the emissions themselves weren’t 
harmful enough, there is the matter of 
how Yale sources their natural gas. Yale 
is the largest consumer of Southern 
Gas Connecticut (sgc)—the father 
company of which, Enbridge, 
was responsible for one of the 
country’s largest oil spills in 
2010, and has been met with 
popular 
governmental 
backlash for its destructive 
fracking practices. Yale’s ties 
to Enbridge can only be found 
with incessant digging through 
financial records and obscure 
documentation—it’s a well-kept 
secret. While Yale leverages 
Enbridge’s resources to power 
campus, it shrouds its behavior 
in greenwashed rhetoric. “In my 
day, they were called smoke­
stacks,” Cox tells me. “Now, 
there’s a bit of a pr campaign to 
make it sound a lot cleaner. So 
exhaust pipes it is.”


Not only does the University 
mask how it sources its natural 
gas, Yale also isn’t contractually 
allowed to sell the power it gen­
erates. The result: Yale operates 
on an isolated microgrid with its 
two plants releasing nearly four­
teen times more greenhouse gases 
than the nearest energy facility in 
New Haven. “Yale had this idea 
early on and was like, you know 
what, we should create our own 
power,” said Cox, emphasizing the 
last part in a booming voice. This 
leaves the University in complete 
control of its operations: Yale 
can choose what type of fuel to 
use, doesn’t need to negotiate 
pricing with energy compa­
nies, and can produce however 
much energy it wants. Yale’s 
historical 
self-sustenance 
is 
what let the plants emit fossil 
fuels emissions above state pol­
lution standards in the 2000’s: its 
older plants weren’t expected to 
comply with modern standards. 
It also will keep the University 
safe during widespread outages 
caused by storms and the city of 
New Haven dependent on Yale 
energy. By isolating itself from 
the grid, Yale has continued to 
keep its resources within the uni­
versity and its power consolidated.


The time has come again for 
Yale to consider revamping its 
energy infrastructure. The Biden 
administration has cracked down 
on natural gas processing facili­
ties and Governor Ned Lamont 
promises that Connecticut will 
be carbon-free by 2040. The 2021 
Yale 
Sustainability 
Progress 
Report announces Yale will use 
“emerging technologies” like geo­
thermal heat and green hydrogen 
fuel to be carbon-free by 2050, but 
progress has been slow and largely 
underwhelming.


The time has come 
again for Yale to 
consider revamping 
its energy 
infrastructure.

our way of life. We’re defending 
the people, our livelihood, our 
culture,” 
commented 
Lindsay 
Wheaton, the owner of the Grand 
Lake Lodge, whose wilderness 
retreat property sits facing the 
ridge lined with windmills. Other 
residents expressed concern about 
the project’s impact on the frag­
ile mountain slopes of Roxbury. It 
appears the project has been can­
celed, though no definite reason is 
given, and it is unlikely that it will 
serve as a blueprint for Yale’s energy 
production anytime soon.

Other universities on the east 
coast, a region without a bounty 
of local solar and wind farms, are 
facing similar problems in find­
ing large-scale solutions. In 2021, 
Harvard 
constructed 
a 
natural 
gas-burning cogeneration plant with 
a chic modern facade, much to the 
annoyance of climate activists. When 
I asked Cox his opinion on wind 
farms, he noted that Yale and other 
older colleges don’t yet have the infra­
structure for a large electrical grid. 
“There are options, but everything’s 
expensive,” added Gillingham. Yale’s 
sizable endowment could help develop 
these technologies, such as refitting the 
existing plants with hydrogen fuel to 
thwart emissions, utilize existing facil­
ities, and keep jobs in New Haven. 
The readiness and cost of greener 
technologies aside, it is clear that 
change is impending and Yale 
will need to do a better job informing 
its operations and attitudes with
the health and safety of surrounding 
communities.

Over the past decade, Yale 
installed geothermal-powered heat
pumps at Kroon Hall, the School 
of the Environment’s central hub. 
These pumps reach 1,600 feet 
down to Earth’s warmer core in 
order to heat water into steam. 
“Only one heat pump out of three 
really works,” said Gillingham. 
“Even if the pumps did work, they 
only provide heat, not electricity, 
so they couldn’t replace the power 
plant’s cogenerating beast.”

Yale could supplement heat 
pumps with a renewable source of 
electricity from one of their many 
pilot projects—the fleet of ten micro 
wind turbines purchased by Yale in 
2009, for example. These turbines 
sit atop Becton, an engineering and 
applied science building on campus, 
and attempt to demonstrate Yale’s 
venture into renewables. But the 
ten fans, which look like miniplane 
rotors, only provide half a percent 
of the building’s annual electricity 
needs. “As windy as it feels on Science 
Hill, it’s really not a great resource 
for producing a lot of electricity,” said 
Gillingham. 

Yale has attempted to think big­
ger by quietly investing 102 million 
dollars in a wind farm company’s proj­
ect to crown Maine’s hilltops with a 
crop of gargantuan, white windmills. 
But the approach, spearheaded by the 
late David Swensen, hasn’t run over 
smoothly with locals. “We’re defending 
need to do a better job informing 
the health and safety of surround­
ing communities. After a century 
of owning its means of energy 
production, the University still 
struggles to properly prepare for 
impending changes—caught flat­
footed when the need for transfor­
mation becomes unavoidable—or 
realize the full scope of its facilities’ 
impact on people. When a repair 
worker fell into the Central Power 
Plant’s chimney to his death in 
2015, the Yale deputy press secretary 
closed out the press release with the 
statement: “Power to campus build­
ings was not affected.”

As the University is called to par­
ticipate in the next stage of the tran­
sition to cleaner energy, the essential 
question remains: can we trust that 
Yale will use its power responsibly?

I walk back to campus from the 
corner of Congress Ave and Frontage 
Road and the power plant hums 
behind my back. Above the passing 
traffic of students and cars, vapor 
drifts from the towering exhaust pipes 
and disperses over campus. Hiding a 
beast in plain sight is no small feat, but 
Yale’s power makes it both possible 
and profitable.

This morning I drew . . .
This morning I drew, as the bath ran,
my long body into shadow, feeling my
self delicious, as if laughter and desire
were weathers over lands to which we,
should we wish it, could quite simply
ride. Do not wear a cork again, to the
open bottle I said. In the cold of that
shade and the water I drank nearly a
sentence I stole while you passed me
off your tongue. Then my nakedness
rose high enough with the angled sun
for clothes to make less sense, and in
an act of madness which often we all
together do I stood, dressed, ate, and
stepped trailing dreamed-up puddles
slyly out the hilarious drunken door.

**Title: A Yale student learns how not to read.**
**Author: Shane Zhang**
**Page number(s): 30**

The Holy Bible:
Annotated and Abridged
Personals
In the beginning was the Word,
and the Word was with God,
and the Word was God.
(John 1:1)

L
ast year, I spent three hours every 
Wednesday afternoon being bat­
tered by the truth of Yale’s 7:1 
student-to-faculty ratio—more teach­
ers in a classroom is not always bet­
ter. There were nine students enrolled 
in “Neighbors and Others” and three 
teachers: 
the 
wonderful 
Professor 
Levene and her two TAs, American 
Alison and British Ed.

It wasn’t supposed to be like this. 
There were originally twenty-six stu­
dents. But on the first day of class a 
senior philosophy major, Andrew, asked 
Professor Levene what the thesis of the 
course was, and when she hesitated and 
told him to find out for himself, five 
people left the Zoom. Andrew stayed, 
but twelve other students dropped 
out over the next three hours as we
discussed the Bible, and I don’t know
why I didn’t follow them. I participated 
exactly once that day, at the very end of 
class, and nearly cried afterwards.

Am I my brother’s keeper?
(Genesis 4:9)

Y
ale seminars are scary. Once, when 
we were asked about the audience 
of a book, the class was subjected to a 
Davenport senior’s slow, thought out 
answer, adding terms one by one as 
he came across them: “The audience 
for this book is likely liberal . . . elite . . . 
intelligentsia . . .” he said, pausing for 
a moment, “and probably coastal. . .” 
He is a legacy student and from New 
Jersey; it felt like watching someone 
masturbate. I recall, during a class 
on Glenn Gould, hearing the phrase 
“sonic sounds” leave someone’s lips 
(sonically). And once, while work­
shopping an essay in a different class, 
I remember every student in the class­
room (myself included) complimenting 
the same awful metaphor about how, 
from above the lake’s surface, you can’t 
see how hard ducks paddle underwater. 
We each said what we liked about the 
essay and what we’d want to improve 
and then, when we ran out of things 
to say, added: “Oh, and I also liked 
your duck metaphor.” It was like baby 
ducks following baby ducks: a bunch of 
dumbasses paddling in a circle.

I wish so badly I could claim to be 
better than them, but I am not. I spent 
most of my first year too overwhelmed 
to participate in almost anything, and 
when I did speak I was only barely 
aware enough to register how dumb I 
sounded. No matter what was in my 
mind, everything seemed to come out 
the same way: “Nice ducks!”

We have different gifts, according to the 
grace given to each of us. If your gift is 
prophesying, then prophesy; if it is serving, 
then serve; if it is teaching, then teach.
(Romans 12:6–7)

T
alking to Professor Levene at her 
office hours, I learned that her pur­
pose for the class was teaching us to read. 
She could easily lecture to us about the 
texts and tell us what we should know, 
but she wanted us to learn to fight and 
figure things out for ourselves. It was 
obvious from our conversation that she 
didn’t think we were doing a good job.

Writing my first essay, I met with 
both British Ed and American Alison. 
They are incredibly kind people. “Your 
thinking is like a firework!” British Ed 
told me. I do actually think he liked 
me. “But it means that sometimes you 
go too fast and get ahead of yourself, 
and don’t articulate your thoughts 
properly. Just work on those middle 
stages between the shell and the final 
explosion. I’m excited to see what you 
come up with.”


I met with American Alison to 
brainstorm and within ten minutes she 
told me I could drop the first essay if I 
needed to.
‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart 
and with all your soul and with all your 
mind and with all your strength.’ The second
is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’
No other commandment is greater than these.
(Mark 12:30–31)


At the end of the semester I stopped 
doing the readings for “Neighbors 
and Others.” In the beginning, when I 
had done the reading and had a lot to 
say, British Ed really liked me and I sat 
next to him most days. By the end of 
the year I was quiet, and sometimes I 
could feel his eyes on me, imploring. 
I’m not sure whether I imagined those 
questions in his gaze, urging me to 
speak! and learn! and practice thinking! 
and struggle please because it’s okay 
you’re safe here! But I stopped looking 
in his direction so I can’t say what really 
was in his eyes. I felt bad imagining he 
wanted what was best for me.


On the last day of the year we 
talked about all the texts we had read 
and each of us brought our favorite 
quotes to class and wrote them up on 
the board. One student skipped. But 
the discussion that day was beautiful 
and I could almost sense Professor 
Levene’s purpose for us, a purpose 
we had missed all semester, some 
path towards dissolving the divide 
between “Neighbor” and “Other.” But 
I still didn’t quite get it. I had trou­
ble understanding a lot of the quotes. 
Everything from Spinoza, Winicott, 
and de Castro confused me without its 
context, and the only sections I really 
understood were from the Bible and 
the first day of class. Love your neigh­
bor. Give to the poor. Take responsi­
bility and be good.


In a moment of silence just before 
the end of class, I spoke and addressed 
Andrew, reminding him of the task he’d 
been set at the beginning of the year—
to discover the class’s thesis himself.
“So what would you say now?” I 
asked, and people laughed. I really 
respect Andrew. This was his second to 
last day of Yale, and I was curious about 
what he had gotten from it all, when I 
felt like I understood so little.
“Oh!” he said. “I remember that. 
But I don’t think I could do a bet­
ter job than what we all brought here 
today. The quotes.” We all looked up 
at the board and read the quotes and 
were silent. Confronted with so many 
words and so many ideas from so many 
authors all at the same time, the letters 
spun together and I couldn’t under­
stand anything at all.


But alright, Andrew. Have it your 
way. The thesis is in the quotes. The 
meaning is in the quotes. You ­apparently 
have learned to read. I did not.

Mid-March, 2020
Today I’m going home for the 
first time in months. I no longer 
notice the petunias just begin­
ning to flower in the window boxes on 
Carroll Street, or the Corinthian col­
umns flanking the entrance to the syn­
agogue on Garfield. Without having to 
look, I lift my wheelie suitcase over a 
particularly big crack in the pavement 
outside my old orthodontist’s office. 
I’ve tripped over that crack enough 
times to know it’s there.


The sun dropping over the heads 
of the brownstones traces a golden 
path on the concrete, at the end of 
which, I know, is my parents’ house. 
“Parents’ house” is something I’ve only 
just started to say, a phrase picked up 
from college friends still waiting for the 
right place to give the word “home”. I’m 
lucky, I know where mine is—but I like 
“parents’ house” anyway. It gives me 
the same thrill as signing my name on a 
check, or tipping someone and saying, 
“keep the change”.


I know just how the house will 
be when I get there. The setting sun 
will draw the color from the bricks, a 
mosaic of pink and brown. The wind, 
still sharp with the last bite of winter 
frost, will rustle through the branches 
of the cherry blossom tree standing on 
the sidewalk next to our stoop. Across 
the street is my old elementary school, 
and the children will be laughing and 
screaming in the playground. There’ll 
be a “Welcome Home!” sign taped to 
the front door, the work of my younger 
sister, Ruby, who’ll be sitting by the 
window waiting for me. 


I know just how I’ll be, too, when I 
get there. I’ll hug my parents, my mom 
first and then my dad an hour later once 
he’s finished his meeting. We’ll sit down 
at the dining room table and rehash 
things I’ve already told them on the 
phone. (“So you ended up getting lunch 
with that girl? Any potential there? Just 
give it time, honey.”) All of us will eat 
dinner together and talk about Trump’s 
press conference, about my parents’ 
work, and family friends who are hav­
ing marital problems. (“Did you hear 
she’s leaving him? But they’ve got a 
baby on the way! Good thing she’s get­
ting out while she still can.”) Tonight, 
when everyone’s asleep, I’ll walk into 
the kitchen to make myself a sandwich 
and feel the numbing dread of discover­
ing a souvenir of my childhood in every 
drawer. A feeling of awful inevitabil­
ity—the moment of quiet just before 
the doll in the horror movie starts to 
move. Here’s the plastic blue spoon I 
used to eat my first bowl of applesauce. 
The black neoprene lunch box from kin­
dergarten with my name scratched on it 
in Sharpie. The photograph of me as a 
baby, my eyes wide and happy above a 
mask of chocolate icing. 


At night I’ll fall into bed and my 
mattress will embrace me like an old 
friend. I’ll stare at the ceiling and start 
to feel that familiar feeling. A slack­
ening, a lassitude. Water swirling and 
glug-glugging down a drain in my chest. 
I’ll make a promise to myself that this 
time will be different—I’ll go on a long 
walk tomorrow—at least three hours—
but when I wake up it’ll be 11:00 and 
I’ll take out my phone and scroll 
through Instagram until the fog clears, 
and when I finally get out of bed the 
day will be half-gone and my slippers 
so comfortable and what’s the point in 
trying to do anything productive now 
anyways? I’ll walk into the kitchen and 
snap at my mom when she asks me how 
I slept. “Fine,” I’ll say, and pour myself 
a cup of coffee from the pot, without a 
thought as to how it had gotten there, 
or how come it’s noon and the pot is 
still full and still hot. “You always 
needed your sleep,” she’ll say. “Just like 
when you were a kid.”

Early-July, 2006
O
ne summer when I was six years 
old, my parents packed us all into 
our scratched and dented black Mazda 
mpv and made the three hour drive up 
the Taconic to Hillsdale, New York. 
We were going to spend the month 
at my grandma’s old country house, a 
ramshackle structure of rotting wood 
and tacky shingles built on top of a 
cleared hilltop in the woods. By day, 
the house was full of magic. I wandered 
from room to room transfixed by the 
hummingbirds hovering to drink from 
my grandmother’s bird feeder, and the 
lines of ants that came at dinnertime 
to collect the crumbs dropped from 
my fork. But when darkness fell, the 
night cracked open with the howls of 
coyotes and toads and owls hoo-hooing 
in voices like the one my mom gave to 
Voldemort when she read to us before 
bed. Then ghosts overtook the house. 
They groaned through the pipes and 
banged around the boiler room and 
creaked over the ancient floorboards. I 
could see them out of the corner of my 
eye as I lay in bed, silhouettes slipping 
toward me across the dark carpet.

Nearly every night when I couldn’t 
fall asleep, I’d clamber upstairs as fast 
as I could and knock quietly on my 
parents’ bedroom door. My dad was 
always awake, sitting up with his read­
ing glasses perched on the tip of his 
nose, typing furiously on his computer. 
“Daddy,” I’d whisper, and he’d sigh 
and hoist himself out of bed and tramp 
behind me back down the stairs, just 
the way he did when I had nightmares 
at home. “I’ll sit here until you fall 
asleep,” he’d say and reopen his com­
puter. In that halo of white light the 
ghosts fled, sliding back into the walls 
where their sounds couldn’t hurt me. 
Sometimes I think I’ve been chasing 
that feeling my whole life, the warmth 
I felt in the safety of his light.


Mid-April, 2020
I 
wake up every day by the glare of 
the sun. The first thing I do in the 
morning is reach for my phone to check 
the time. It’s been getting later every 
week: 10:30, 10:45, 11:00, 11:15. A couple 
weeks ago I decided it was okay to miss 
my morning Art History lecture. We’re 
not getting graded, and when will I 
ever need to know about post-Impres­
sionist artists? People only care about 
the Impressionists anyway. Since then 
I’ve missed nearly every class. Instead, 
I watch YouTube videos until I can feel 
my bladder all the way down in my 
knees, and then I pad down the hall to 
the bathroom and hold a hand over my 
eyes to block the light while I consider 
whether it’s worth it today to put in my 
contact lenses. 

In the month I’ve been back home, 
news of the covid-19 pandemic has 
gotten worse. School has been canceled 
for at least the semester. I can count 
on one hand the number of people I’ve 
seen outside my family. The man at the 
deli who spreads cream cheese on my 
bagel. The guy with a nose ring who 
sells me weed. My neighbor, an elderly 
man with a pinched face and angry 
eyes who sits on his stoop all day feed­
ing treats to passing dogs. (“What’s a 
human gotta do to get one of those,” 
I called to him once, on the way back 
from the deli with a bagel. He didn’t 
respond.) I’ve thought about texting 
some friends to go on a walk, but when 
I scroll through my high school contact 
list—Ananda, Henry, Jane, Trish—I 
start to feel queasy and decide to do it 
later, when I’m feeling more up to it. 
It’s not that I don’t want to see them. 
It’s just that doing anything at all feels 
too much to ask of myself. 

My desk is a waiter’s tray of un-
washed coffee mugs, cups and plates, 
my clothes a heap on the carpet. My 
bedside table is stacked high with jour­
nals abandoned after the second page. 
I take Zoom classes with the laptop 
screen tilted up toward the wall, so 
people don’t see the mess. I’ve come 
to dread our nightly family dinners 
because my dad will ask me if I’ve been 
outside that day. “You should take a 
walk,” he’ll say. “It’ll do you good.” 
“You just don’t get it,” I’ll huff, and pick 
at my food.

When dinner is over and my par­
ents have gone upstairs, my brother, 
sister and I gather in the living room. 
Someone takes out a joint, a board 
game, or a bottle of wine, and for the 
night we’ll be three kids with every­
thing except someone to tell us no. My 
brother Noah is the musician, and he 
grabs the aux. “Mellow or wild,” he 
asks, and we laugh and go “mild”. My 
sister Ruby is the chef, and she sections 
out the cookie dough. “No, let’s have 
brownies this time,” I yell from the 
living room. “Make your own fucking 
brownies,” she calls back. The streets 
slowly empty of night-owl dads walk­
ing their dogs; the security guard with 
a Mets baseball cap comes by to lock 
the school playground. Deep into the 
night the three of us stay up, playing 
Settlers of Catan and watching Game 
of Thrones. Nights like these, I remem­
ber why I love this place so much, why 
I find it so hard to stay away. But then 
night oozes into morning, viscous like 
cheap syrup, and I feel the water empty 
down the drain again.

On the sidewalk outside our house, 
the cherry blossom tree is in full bloom. 
Sometimes I take my breakfast out onto 
the front stoop, watching petals spiral 
down to catch in my hair. There’s a little 
kid who likes to play down on the street 
with his action figures—the grandson 
of one of my neighbors. When the wind 
gets to gusting the tree spills a swirling 
ribbon of pink petals over the road, and 
the little boy goes chasing after them, 
trying to land one on his tongue. I 
watch him play sometimes, sipping my 
coffee. It’s almost too easy to switch 
places with him. If I close my eyes, I 
can feel the hot concrete on the soles of 
my shoes, and the way the sweet smell 
of spring fires up my bloodstream, and 
the bitter taste of those cotton-candy 
petals, dissolving on my tongue.


Early-November, 2018
’m sitting on a low stone bench in 
the Parco di Celio, overlooking the 
plaza and the sagging Colosseum lit 
up from within like a rotting jack o’ 
lantern. I’ve decided to take a year off 


**Page number(s): 35**

before college, enchanted by the idea of 
discovering myself by discovering the 
world – a project which a couple weeks 
ago seemed as simple as buying a plane 
ticket. Tomorrow, I take the train north 
from Termini Station into Tuscany, 
where I’ll spend the next couple of 
months at a vineyard, picking grapes. 
I can’t think about it without my heart 
lurching precariously against my rib­
cage. But for tonight I’m in Rome, 
slowly eating a slice of pizza purchased 
from the first place I came across with 
English signs, trying to take in the glit­
tering lights of the Colosseum without 
thinking about tomorrow.

On the way back to the hostel I hear 
the sinking, tinkling sound in my head­
phones that means my phone’s about to 
die—doo, doo, doo. I have no idea where 
I am, I’m using Google Maps to nav­
igate, but each time I look down the 
battery is lower. 5% . . . 4% . . . 3%. How 
could I be so stupid? I start to run, 
squeezing around couples strolling 
hand-in-hand through narrow alley­
ways. Everyone is young and together 
in this city. I turn a corner and almost 
run over a lady with her dog. She yells 
something in Italian, but I don’t notice 
because there at the end of the street is 
the door of my hostel. I reach it just as 
my phone screen turns black. 

My little room on the second floor 
is too dark to fall asleep. I try opening 
the curtains, but still the blackness is 
impenetrable and I can’t see my hand 
held out in front of my face. I reach 
over and turn on the flashlight on my 
charging phone, covering it partially 
in dirty clothes until the room glows 
softly with light.

The sounds drifting in through 
the open window are unfamiliar—the 
rattling of bicycle wheels over cobble­
stones and the strange inflections of 
foreign voices. I feel something hot and 
panicky rise up from my chest and stick 
in my throat, pushing up against the 
hollow beneath my Adam’s apple. How 
will I ever fall asleep like this? I close 
my eyes and picture what would’ve 
happened if my phone had died just a 
little earlier. Where would I have slept? 
Who would I have asked for help? Two 
months is such a long time to be away 
from home; everyone I need is too far 
away to help. They must all be asleep by 
now—out of reach.

Suddenly I sit up in bed. I’d for­
gotten about the time difference; it’s 
six hours earlier in New York. They’ll 
be at dinner, sitting together around 
the dining room table. I snatch my 
phone from beneath the pile of clothes 
and call my mom, forgetting to use 
FaceTime to avoid the long-distance 
charge. She picks up on the second 
ring. “Hi McLovin!” she says, a joke 
so old I forget how it started. “Mom,” 
I whisper, as the pressure of the black­
ness suddenly lifts away. “Will you just 
talk to me for a bit?”

Late-April, 2020
T
oday I think I’ll go for a walk. I 
pack some peanuts in a Ziploc 
bag, grab a Jonathan Franzen novel 
and head out the door. It’s a still, lazy 
time of day, and the air feels heavy with 
the smell of an approaching rain. I set 
off down 1st Street and take a right 
onto 6th Avenue. Every street is col­
ored with the emotional resonance of 
a memory. This corner is where I got 
bitten by my dog when he was still an 
untrained puppy, and here is the store 
where we get fresh matzah on Passover. 
I take a right on Sterling Street, pass 
the bench where I got drunk for the 
first time, another right onto 8th 
Avenue, stopping for a moment to take 
a sip of water at the synagogue where I 
had my bar mitzvah, dancing the horah 
with a girl I wanted to kiss. Another 
left onto Garfield Place, up the slope 
where I don’t go skateboarding any­
more because I’ve fallen too many 
times, into the park and through a little 
opening in the trees, where the leaves 
are damp and thick underfoot, where 
the air is just as restless as me. 

A little ways along a pond emerges, 
covered by a thick, green carpet of 
spring algae. I sit beside it on a damp 
log and take out the bag of peanuts, 
watching as the algae drifts back 
and forth over the water. A squirrel 
scampers down the trunk of a nearby 
tree and approaches me, his front leg 
extended as if reaching for something. 
He wants a peanut, I think. I toss a 
handful into the grass, but the squirrel 
ignores them. He’s staring at me, his 
head cocked. His eyes are black. We 
look at each other for a moment, and 
then I stomp my foot and he scurries 
back up the tree. 

A patch of opaque water opens 
up in the algae before me. I lean over 
and my reflection rises up to meet 
me. I sense the algae drifting across 
the pond, forward and back, and the 
trees swaying in the breeze, and for 
a moment I feel the ground beneath 
me fall away. The big wet log is gone, 
the trees and the grass and the algae 
blend together into a smear of green, 
and I feel as if I’m tipping forward into 
empty space, into the pond. I clutch the 
log for support but my head is spinning 
from the heat. It strikes me all of a sud­
den how bizarre it is that the reflection 
in the water should be mine – my nose, 
my hair, my shapeless, chapped lips. I 
step back from the edge into the shade 
of the tree and lie down on the grass, 
trying to steady myself. Above me, 
the squirrel rustling through slender 
branches dislodges an acorn. It lands 
with a plunk in the water and sinks 
below the algae, out of sight. 

On the way home the clouds rum­
ble and finally let loose a torrent of 
rain. I haven’t packed an umbrella, so 
I decide to make a run for it, holding 
the nearly empty backpack above my 
head. Everything weeps silver pearls 
of rain—the leaves, the lampposts, the 
umbrellas bobbing above faceless peo­
ple on 8th Avenue. 

When I get to the top of my street, 
I pause. I have nowhere to go, and the 
rain is beating down harder, but I can’t 
go home. The thought of my room with 
its moldy coffee cups and unfinished 
journals is repulsive now. The sky is a 
wash of gray, the sun hidden behind a 
sheet of clouds. It’s funny to think how 
closely my life obeyed the movement 
of the sun only a few months ago. I 
hardly notice it anymore. Night is the 
turning of a switch, day the opening of 
a computer. The low branch of a cherry

blossom tree dumps a soggy clump of 
white and pink petals at my feet, and I 
want to be anywhere else.

want to go home. I’ve been back at 
school for a month and everything is 
locked down. I’m sick of spending all 
day in my room with its peeling, tal­
low-colored walls, taking classes on my 
computer among a mess of plastic bowls 
and plastic utensils and paper coffee 
cups. I’m sick of scuttling through the 
fluorescent-lit tunnel beneath Cross 
Campus to the dining hall three times 
a day, where I have to sanitize before 
getting my food and the tables are fixed 
with plexiglass dividers. I’m sick of my 
cramped room, so small I hit my desk 
when I roll out of bed, I feel exhausted, 
overworked. I’m sick of my suitemates. 
I miss the pressure of my shower 
at home, and the gurgle of my coffee 
maker, and the drawer next to the stove 
with all my favorite snacks. I miss stay­
ing in bed all morning, and getting up 
to my mom cooking breakfast in the 
kitchen, and the reliable clickety-clack of 
my dad’s typing. I miss laughing with 
my siblings all night. I miss having too 
much time to know what to do with.

F
uck it. Shirt, pants, underwear, 
socks, toiletries, don’t forget con­
tact solution, shove it into a backpack, 
bring tape in case it rips, Uber to the 
station—ticket, purchased, activated—
Can I see your ticket? Metro North train 
rattling southwest over wooden tracks, 
lifting my mask for a quick bite of rub­
bery Sbarro pizza, Grand Central sta­
tion, shiny terrazzo floors give way to 
the familiar grit of the subway, shoving 
between rush-hour commuters on the 
downtown 4/5, this cannot be covid-safe, 
switch to the 2/3 at Nevins Street, ride 
a puff of hot air out onto the platform, 
emerge into sweet pollen-scented air, 
8th Avenue, petunias standing in a line 
above window boxes on Carroll, sheer 
white pillars on Garfield, mind the crack, 
bare branches of cherry trees, disrobed, 
delicate, a pirouetting ballerina with­
out her tutu, children laughing in the 
playground, a sign taped to the door, 
Welcome Home. 

I know just who I’ll be when I get 
inside, and I know just how quickly I’ll 
want to leave again. I oscillate between 
two competing versions of myself—
the part that rebels against this place, 
who yearns to go wherever it is you go 
to feel and hurt, and to come home 
triumphant, and the part who needs 
to be here because I don’t know what 
it means to exist anywhere else. For 
me, home is a riptide. It lurks always 
just beneath the surface, pulling me 
backward in time, back to the child 
cocooned in a circle of white light. I 
don’t think I can escape it until I learn 
how to want to. Maybe that’s what it 
means to grow up.

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
In a brightly lit corner of 
Trumbull’s basement, between the 
pool table and the buttery, a little 
modernized slice of electronic his­
tory beeps and boops at pool sharks 
and passersby. The replica Ms. Pac-
Man machine is free to play. Games 
like Galaga (1 and 2) and Donkey 
Kong pop up on the loading screen, 
but the headliners, the iconically 
hungry yellow ball and his wife, 
stand out at the top of the list.


On a few long winter nights 
last year, pushing the joystick down 
toward the bar stool, I guided the 
yellow pixels around the little 
maze-prison, full of points to accu­
mulate and ghosts to outsmart. At 
each new path, the Pixels (2015) star 
munched his way down the dashed 
line, offering me a respite from the 
rest of the weeknight evening spent 
munching through responsibilities 
arranged in a dashed line in my 
Google calendar.


With an unshakable reliance on 
G-Cal’s artificial memory to track 
classes, meetings, and sometimes 
social interaction, it’s easy to chew 
through a day, tasking away experi­
ences as scheduled instead of spon­
taneous. My late-night forays into 
the pixelated cartoon realm were a 
chance to leave my own chewable 
to-do list for a moment, in favor of 
something useless. I never got the 
machine’s highscore, not that I was 
really trying, and I never scheduled 
my interactions with the near-futile 
joystick in advance.


I haven’t visited the red joystick 
and nineteen-eighties sound bytes in 
a while. For now, they lie dormant 
under Elm Street, waiting for some­
one else to do something useless.

Apology Text to my Editor
Hi this is terrible of me! 
There are factors involved 
which could be in my control 
but I’ve chosen to release them, 
which is my fault. I’m sorry for 
the bad communication.

1.

I wish we still took pictures
of our hands and feet
in the early mornings.

Roused from sleep
to snap each other.

Rubbing at our elbows
for warmth,
sparks that neared 
and disappeared.

2.

The sweetness of desire
ripping from the chest

when the ghost
that you desire is

mistiness, 

a gloss 
beyond 
the stretch 

of skin 
on bone 
the hip 

the strength 
you hope 
exists 

behind 
the veil 

the quiet.

The New Journal was founded in 1967, under the following mission statement: “This university has once again reached that stage in history when 
people are talking about the New Yale, presumably to be distinguished from the Old Yale, which in its own day was presumably considered new. 
Wishing to share in this modernity, we have chosen The New Journal as the name for our publication. Besides, things seemed slow around here.”


Today, The New Journal is published five times during the academic year by The New Journal at Yale, Inc. Two thousand five 
hundred copies of each issue are distributed free to members of the Yale and New Haven community. The New Journal is 
printed by TCI Press, Seekonk, Massachusetts; bookkeeping and billing services are provided by Colman Bookkeeping of 
New Haven. Office Address: P.O. Box 3311, New Haven, CT 06515.
