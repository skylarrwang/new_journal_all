Community Kitchen, or YCK: a food-rescue program 
where student volunteers serve and staff dinner service 
with food donated by Yale Dining. 
On weekend nights, YCK volunteers in hairnets 
and chalky white gloves serve chicken thighs, grilled 
carrots, and Bolognese pasta on plastic trays. At round 
tables in folding chairs, about fifty men, women, and 
children eat dinners that closely resemble what the 
Yale student volunteers ate in the dining halls that 
week. YCK Project Heads Willemijn van Deursen and 
Maurice Ware are grateful for the friendships they’ve 
built at the United Parish House over the years, though 
they hope for a day when they no longer see the same 
people meal after meal. “Our goal as an organization 
is not to exist because then there wouldn’t be a need,” 
said van Deursen.


Today, some emergency food services in New Haven 
are made possible by Yale Dining’s inefficiencies. It’s a 
fragile system: meeting the urgent needs of one group 
currently depends on another group having too much. 
Yale Dining is also a steady donor to Haven’s Harvest, 
a one-year-old food recovery nonprofit that redistributes 
food through a deep and broad community network. 
“Runners” drive trays from restaurants, supermarkets, 
and universities to churches, housing complexes, and 
community agencies. These hyper-local exchanges 
typically take no longer than fifteen minutes.
“The perimeter of Yale’s campus is food insecure,” 
said Lori Martin, the founder and executive director 
of Haven’s Harvest. “We don’t need to move food far to 
make a difference, and nobody within an arm’s length 
of this campus should go without food.” 
On one run in November, Caleb MartinMooney, 
Haven’s Harvest’s operations director and Martin’s 
son, parked his gray station wagon on York Street. 
He descended the stone steps to Branford College’s 
basement kitchen and grabbed three pans of food from 
a walk-in refrigerator. He loaded orzo, herbed chicken, 
and eggplant parmesan into his Bernie-sticker-
speckled trunk. With NPR on low in the background, 
MartinMooney drove 2.1 miles to the Fair Haven 
Elderly Apartments where he dropped off the food in 
a common area with large windows and potted plants. 
He retrieved a dozen pans from last week’s delivery and 
drove home. This run is one of about twenty of Haven’s 
Harvest food transfers that happen each day, totaling 
nearly a million pounds of redistributed food annually.


It was initially difficult for Martin to find a home for 
her carloads of organic and commercially grown food. 
Four of the pillars of emergency food service in New 
Haven—DESK, Columbus House, Loaves and Fishes, 
and the Community Soup Kitchen—rely mostly on 
food banks and had little interest in the variety and 
unpredictability of Haven’s Harvest’s supply. But Martin 
knew that more residents than those who regularly 
attend soup kitchens experience food insecurity. 
“Excess food is not just for those in need, an ‘us’ and 
‘them,” said Martin. She described one encounter with 
a woman from Connecticut’s shoreline who called 
with six pans of food leftover from a town hall. Martin 
called several faith communities near the donor site 
and found a place that could use the food. When she 
told the donor where the food was going, the donor  was 
surprised it wasn’t headed for New Haven. “There are 
people who are hungry everywhere,” Martin reflected. 
“What has been surprising is food insecurity is so silent. 
Sometimes we don’t hear about it until that burden has 
been lifted.”


Martin has since developed a community-centered 
approach to food recovery. Through word of mouth, 
people know to call her when spare food arises 
unexpectedly, whether that’s dozens of pizza boxes 
from a conference or six-hundred burritos from a 
hackathon. 
Sometimes businesses are shocked by the amount 
of excess food coming from their own kitchens. This 
realization may prompt institutional efforts to reduce 
food waste, resulting in fewer food donations. Martin 
urges food providers to embrace, rather than resent, 
the leftovers they do produce. “Excess food is not a 
shameful thing,” she said. “But the ‘shamefulness’ 
makes it so we can’t talk truthfully about leftover food. 
If employees can’t tell the truth, then the food will 
get thrown away when we could have done something 
better with it.”     
“EXCESS FOOD IS NOT A 
SHAMEFUL THING. BUT 
THE ‘SHAMEFULNESS’ 
MAKES IT SO WE CAN’T 
TALK TRUTHFULLY ABOUT 
LEFTOVER FOOD.”


Despite the potential for more food aid to come 
from newly-embraced leftovers, Martin understands 
that food redistribution will only ever be a temporary 
solution to a deeper problem. Austin Bryniarski, a 
School of Forestry & Environmental Studies graduate, 
focuses on the politics of food waste. He commends 
Martin’s willingness to talk about power, race, class 
and gender when it comes to food redistribution, but 
he wishes that the emergency food service industry as a 
whole would “flex its political muscles” more. 
In Bryniarski’s eyes, food recovery programs, banks, 
and kitchens address an immediate lack of food while 
often forgetting that hunger is just one way that poverty 
manifests. “The most sustainable, structural way to 
address food insecurity is to address the poverty that 
makes food so hard to come by,” said Bryniarski. 
“Otherwise, you miss the forest for the trees.”


Bryniarski also worries some of these programs treat 
food-insecure populations as mere mouths to consume 
unwanted excess. “The people on the receiving end of 
this food basically become a safety valve for a system in 
which people produce too much,” said Bryniarski. 
Critiquing a system of emergency food providers 
has complex implications, especially when so many 
residents currently depend on them for their meals. 
But Bryniarski is right that alleviating food insecurity 
in New Haven would require more of Yale than surplus 
food donations.


If the University supported upstream political 
change, like affordable housing, job creation, and 
fair wage initiatives, fewer people would depend on 
emergency food providers. Mayor-Elect Justin Elicker, 
for instance, urges the University to rethink its tax 
contribution to the city. In his Blue New Deal, he 
pressures Yale to give $50 million annually, quadruple 
its current voluntary contribution. Elicker believes 
this money would dramatically increase New Haven’s 
ability to function as a city. Moving from a temporary 
solution to a permanent one takes time, and there are 
limits to what any institution, even one as powerful as 
Yale, can do to effect change. To start, Yale Dining could 
supplement its farm tours with initiatives to advance 
a campus-wide understanding of food insecurity and 
food waste as pieces of a larger structural puzzle. 
While college students today are often told to attend 
to the present moment, it is worth thinking about the 
future: the immediate future in which our garbanzo 
bean vestiges power the Southington fire station and 
leftover orzo from college kitchens finds a second home 
at DESK, but also the future that people like Bryniarski 
are working towards, in which food insecurity doesn’t 
exist and food waste is not wasted. The next time you’re 
eating Quinoa-Stuffed Peppers in your residential 
college, engage in the hallowed tradition of dining 
hall discourse, and ask your neighbor: how can we get 
there?
