he autumn leaves of New Hampshire’s Coos 
County, the Great North Woods, beyond the 
White Mountains, obscure my view. I am 
searching for what Rick Samson, seated next to me in a 
camouflage button-down, is trying to show me, but I can’t 
see past the burnt yellows, oranges, and caramel browns. 
Samson and I are in his black pickup, bumping along a 
gravel road a few miles into a dense woodland. The vast 
majority—81 percent—of New Hampshire land is forest. 
Every so often Samson slows his truck to say, “See how 
small this stuff is? There was nothing here when they cut 
it,” or, “If you look down through there, there is nothing; 
there is nothing left here at all.” But everywhere I look, 
except for a few unremarkable tracts where the forest has 
been cleared, I see trees—poplars, beeches, maples—and 
lots of them.

I am not qualified to assess whether a logging operation 
is sustainable or not. But neither, really, is Samson. Even 
though he has spent more than seventy years hunting 
and snowmobiling in the New Hampshire woods, he is 
a county commissioner with no technical background in 
forestry. Still, Samson isn’t shy about sharing his opinion. 
The tree trunks are skinnier than they should be, he says, 
and they have been hacked down in recent years where 
they should have been thriving. 

Samson feels so strongly about the mismanagement of 
the land here, in Millsfield, New Hampshire, that he has 
agreed to take me on a tour of the property without its 
owner’s permission. As a public official, Samson is not too 
worried about getting in trouble. He is confident that he 
could proffer a convincing excuse were someone to catch 
us. I am not worried, either, because I feel that I have a 
stake in the land. I am a Yale student, and Yale, though 
reluctant to admit it, owns this forest. 

To be precise, the Yale Investments Office owns it. 
Unlike Yale’s research forests, which the School of 
Forestry own and operate, this timberland is part of the 
university’s $30.3 billion endowment. Its purpose, plain 
and simple, is profit. 

Nothing about the physical property suggests that 
the trees are Yale’s. A sign at the entrance declares that 
the land belongs to “Bayroot LLC.” A Google search of 
“Bayroot LLC” reveals that the company has no website. 
Indeed, it is difficult to ascertain exactly what Bayroot is. 
According to a handful of news articles, Bayroot is not an 
ordinary LLC, but a “subsidiary” or a “shell company.” 
More informative is a line in Yale’s federal tax documents, 
which says the university owns 98.8 percent of Bayroot, 
a share valued at $58.6 million, as of 2018. Essentially, 
Bayroot is a name on paper—a name that conveniently 
conceals the Yale Investments Office’s efforts to gobble up 
land in rural New Hampshire and Maine. 

To make matters more complicated, Yale (or Bayroot) 
doesn’t actually manage the land it owns; a company 
called Wagner Forest Management does. Wagner 
oversees logging operations and land management plans 
on 2.7-million acres of forest across New England and 
eastern Canada. The primary goal of timber investment 
management organizations like Wagner is to maximize 
return for their investors. Between 1993 and 2017, 
investments in U.S. timber returned an average of a little 
over 8 percent, meaning that timber is a stable long-term 
investment. In his book Pioneering Portfolio Management, 
David Swensen, Yale’s chief investment officer, explains 
that timberland “offers strong return potential, steady cash 
flow, inflation protection, and portfolio diversification.” In 
short, it is a safe and steady institutional investment—one 
that won’t necessarily make a fortune in the short term, but 
will generate good returns over the course of generations. 
(Swensen declined to comment for this story.)

Most of the trees in Coos County used to be owned 
by paper companies, but within the last three decades, 
timber supply has shifted to a global market as cheap 
imports have outmatched domestic products. The local 
forest-products industry has been hit hard. Coos’ mills 
have shuttered, and outside private investors like Yale 
have bought up holdings, hoping to capitalize on timber’s 
low risk and steady returns.

Northern New Hampshire has always relied heavily—
economically and culturally—on forests. Timber “is 
our economy. It’s our sense of place and our sense 
of community. Our heritage really is built into the 
landscape,” said Liz Wyman, a Yale School of Forestry 
graduate who now lives in Lancaster, the county seat. 
Lifelong Coos County resident and local journalist John 
Harrigan, who used to manage 160 acres of timberland 
around his home, echoed Wyman. “I’ve been involved in 
wood, one way or another, all my life. It’s just part of me,” 
said Harrigan, whose dining hall ceiling is supported by 
gargantuan red maple logs, cut in the mid-19th century.

As I ride along with Samson through the woods, he 
recalls that, in 2017, Harrigan and another one of his 
friends, Wayne Montgomery, a former logger, were fined 
$124 for escorting a few Yale School of Forestry students 
along the same private road that we are now driving down. 
They were checking on the forest, much as Samson and 
I are. (Neither Samson nor the students were charged 
because they were passengers, and the fine was for

operating motorized vehicles without permission.) 
Later, when I visited Harrigan at his home, he laughed 
about the fine. Harrigan, whose family has owned two 
Coos County newspapers for decades, has been dubbed 
“The King of the North Country” because he is quite 
possibly more devoted to the woods of northern New 
Hampshire than anyone else. While Harrigan has not 
spent much time analyzing Wagner’s forestry practices, 
he called the company’s management of the Millsfield 
forest  “a cut-and-get-out,” a logging job “with little regard 
for what could come.” He said that a lot of people can’t 
tell the difference between a “quick cut for profit” and a 
genuinely sustainable harvest. “When they look at a forest, 
they just see trees.” 

Dottie Kurtz sees Wagner’s trees just about everyday. 
Kurtz is a town administrator in Errol, another one-main-
intersection Coos County hamlet, which borders Yale’s 
land. I met her at the Errol town hall, a three-story white 
wood home. As Kurtz and I walked around the town 
hall’s main foyer, lined with photos of lumberjacks and 
felled logs, I asked her about allegations against Wagner’s 
timber practices. To my surprise, she gave me a perplexed 
look and said, “I have never heard anyone say anything 
negative—ever.”

Wagner manages the land adjacent to Kurtz’s backyard. 
She often rides her snowmobile along the network of 
trails that crisscrosses Wagner-managed forest. “They 
take good care of the land,” Kurtz said. “They manage 
it well. They’re good neighbors.” Kurtz knew about the 
Yale-Bayroot connection, although she wasn’t bothered by 
it and said most people in Errol probably were not aware 
of it. When I pressed her again about the possibility that 
Wagner has not managed Yale’s land to a high ethical 
standard, she was nearly lost for words. “I can’t—I’m 
dumbfounded.” 

I, too, was dumbfounded. After all the suspicious things 
I had heard about Wagner, here was one of Wagner’s 
neighbors telling me the company was taking good care of 
the land. Then again, I knew that most people, including 
me, could not tell the difference between good and bad 
timber management. In Yale Forestry Professor Chad 
Oliver’s lingo: “A lot of amateurs don’t know a good forest 
practice when they see it.” Besides, even the few people 
with enough expertise to assess a timber harvest might 
have different understandings of what “good” and “bad” 
mean in the world of forestry. 

After speaking with Kurtz, I doubted more than ever 
that Wagner was an evil corporation laying waste to the 
county’s forests. But I also figured that, as friendly and 
forthright as Kurtz was, she might not be seeing the whole 
picture. And I feared that I wasn’t either.

The environmental consequences of unsustainable 
logging are fairly straightforward: habitat loss (for animals 
like lynx, in New England), decline in biodiversity, soil 
and watershed damage. But maybe the most urgent danger 
is climate change: forests store a tremendous amount of 
carbon. According to the United States Department of 
Agriculture, forests offset 13 percent of the United States’ 
carbon emissions. 

NEFF, a forest conservation nonprofit, has published 
guidelines for timber practices that would sequester 1.9 
gigatons of carbon in New England forests in the next 
twenty years—the equivalent of taking every vehicle in 
New England off the road, according to NEFF’s executive 
director Bob Perschel. “Yale could be a part of that 
challenge,” Perschel said.

Since neither Perschel nor the rest of us know exactly 
how Wagner manages Yale’s land, it is impossible to say 
specifically what the company could do differently. But 
NEFF’s recommended logging practices would generate 
2 to 4 percent in annual returns, falling well short of the 
Yale endowment’s 5.7 percent average annual return on 
natural resources over the last ten years.

In 2009, Yale said that its timber interests comprised 
roughly three-million acres. The University has held 
vast holdings in New England forestland at least since 
the early 2000s. In December 2003, Bayroot bought 129 
thousand acres of land in New Hampshire and more than 
five hundred thousand acres in Maine. At the time, no 
one was aware that Bayroot was connected to Yale. “All 
we knew about was Bayroot, Bayroot, Bayroot,” Samson 
reflected. “We thought it was just another company.” (Yale 
also owns 91.3 percent of Typhoon LLC, which, according 
to a 2011 Bangor Daily News article, holds 471,000 
thousand of acres of land in Maine. Typhoon LLC’s land, 
like Bayroot’s, is managed by Wagner.)

Much about Yale’s endowment is mysterious. Swensen 
has not revealed any specifics about Yale’s holdings—such 
as value, location, amount of returns, or partnerships 
with other companies. Swensen has railed against student 
activists and the Yale Daily News, which, he wrote in a 
March 2018 op-ed in the News, “frequently fails to meet 
fundamental journalistic standards” in reporting on the 
endowment. But when student activists and reporters,

and even members of directly affected communities, 
like Samson, a say-it-like-it-is Navy vet and registered 
Republican, have pressed the University to defend its 
investment practices, administrators have responded with 
condescension at worst and cryptic answers at best. The 
Investments Office has a policy not to speak with reporters 
on the record.

Yale cannot dispute that Wagner has not been perfect. 
The company was fined $35,000 in 2009 by the Maine 
Forest Service for clearcutting in an area of Bayroot land 
where such activity was not allowed. Clearcutting is the 
practice of removing every last merchandisable tree from 
an area of five or more acres. 

Glenn Booma, a biologist by training who has spent time 
in Bayroot’s woods since the nineteen-seventies, said he 
can immediately tell the difference when he crosses onto 
Bayroot land. Booma doesn’t have a formal background in 
forestry, but he doesn’t hold back from criticizing Wagner. 
“What I see when I walk on their property is embarrassing 
for them,” Booma says, and it “could likely be corrected 
with modest improvements in timber management.” 
He describes trees cut too close to wetlands and severe 
erosion near roads and waterways. Sediment from erosion 
after a harvest can harm trout populations; alongside a 
New Hampshire state fish biologist, Booma found that 
the area’s brook trout “literally decreased by hundreds 
of fish in a hundred meter stretch” following a heavy cut 
on Bayroot land. Booma observes that these practices, 
though inexcusable, might be expected of a for-profit 
timber company. But of an institution that claims to care 
so deeply about environmental stewardship and ethical 
leadership?

In a 2017 open letter to the Yale Investments Office, 
Wyman, the Yale Forestry graduate, implored the 
University “to stop destroying our landscape, communities, 
environment, and economy with poor management 
decisions on its thousands of acres of timberland in 
New Hampshire.” Wyman also is not an expert in 
forest management, but she did learn about sustainable 
forestry at the Yale School of Forestry. She said she has 
enough background to feel confident that Wagner is “not 
practicing real, genuine sustainable forestry.” And Yale, 
she says, is complicit.

“How would you sum up what Yale has done wrong, 
what Wagner has done wrong, what Bayroot has done 
wrong?” I ask Wayne Montgomery, Samson’s former 
logger friend, who leans all the way back in his recliner, 
his feet nearly level with his head. 

Montgomery, Samson, and I are at Montgomery’s 
house, a one-story, light blue home, typical of rural New 
England, with an American flag hanging out front and 
a pickup parked in the driveway. Montgomery lives in 
Groveton, New Hampshire, a small town that used to 
buzz with the hum of a paper mill, but now is unhurried 
and quiet, other than the occasional whizz of a timber 
lorry passing through town.

Wagner manages its forests, Montgomery answers, 
“with a policy of just trying to produce the highest-valued 
products as quickly and as much as they can, and it’s a 
short term management plan. There’s no sustainability.” 
Montgomery admits that he cannot say with certainty at 
what rate Wagner harvests timber, but he said he would bet 
it is “three or four times” that of truly sustainable logging 
companies. To put it simply, Montgomery argues that 
Wagner harvests far too fast to maintain an ecologically 
healthy forest. 

Montgomery ushers me over to his dining room table, 
where four printed-out satellite images lay side by side. 
Two of the photos show Bayroot’s land in Millsfield, one 
captured in 2003, when Bayroot bought the land, the 
other from 2015, after the land had been logged. The 2003 
photo reveals an emerald green earth, fractured only by 
a few skinny brown lines representing roads. Referring to 
the 2015 photo, Samson joked, “If a squirrel wanted to go 
across that land it would need a knapsack and lunch.”

As I view the images, Montgomery opens his laptop 
and pulls up the satellite software administered by the 
University of New Hampshire. He says that Dartmouth 
College owns and manages a timber operation on 
land adjacent to Bayroot’s land, in Cambridge, New 
Hampshire. Both Samson and Montgomery insist that 
Dartmouth practices exemplary forestry. 

Montgomery zooms in on the border of Bayroot’s land 
and Dartmouth’s land. “This is the Dartmouth property 
here,” he says, pointing to the right side of the screen. 
“And it is treated totally and completely different. Now 
there are places where they’ve harvested timber here, and 
you can actually see that.” Then he points a little to the 
left of the border. “But there’s nothing left here; this strip 
of land—there’s nothing left. It’s gone,” he says.

Even to my untrained eye, the evidence of clearcutting 
on Bayroot’s land seemed stark. But I still was not quite sure 
what to do with that knowledge. In the moment, I assumed 
clearcutting was not good practice, but upon further 
research, I discovered that it actually can be advisable in 
certain situations. In its guide to ecologically sound forest 
management, the New England Forestry Foundation
