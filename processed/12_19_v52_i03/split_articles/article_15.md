all Street seems like just another 
minor thread in New Haven’s urban 
fabric. Physically, it boasts nothing 
remarkable except maybe the size of its potholes, 
although it is a little wonky, running one-way 
eastbound three blocks from College to Orange 
and one-way westbound on its final block between 
State and Orange. But the street’s history, and that 
of similar streets running through Yale’s campus, 
unveil a deeper story about the fraught relationship 
between Yale and New Haven. 
The street is only six blocks long. Walking west 
along Wall on a crisp sunny day, I pass several 
parking lots, a daycare center, and two churches. 
On the corner of Wall and Church, sun reflecting 
off the green glass Chase Bank tower casts surreal 
reflections on the pavement beneath my beat-up 
white Nikes. Moving further, the first signs of Yale 
gradually appear. Gothic spires slowly fill my vision, 
and by the time I reach the intersection of Wall and 
College, I’m encircled by the campus: meticulously 
planted flower beds, sturdy wooden benches, and 
students bustling to and from class.
This past summer, Yale turned a section of Wall 
into a pedestrian walkway. But the story of Yale’s 
takeover really began in 1990, when the University 
secured the rights to restrict vehicle traffic on Wall 
Street and High Street for twenty years. The deal 
cost Yale $1.1 million up front, with an investment 
of more than $50 million in New Haven over the 
following ten years.
In 2011, the University and the city revisited the 
original agreement. After intense debate about what 
the future of the streets should look like, lawmakers 
failed to reach a decision. In the meantime, Yale 
crafted a new proposal—one that would allow the 
University to purchase the streets outright for $3 
million with no future payments.
When this plan was brought to a vote on June 3, 
2013, the aldermanic chamber erupted. Protestors 
stood in the back of the hall chanting “Whose streets? 
Our streets. Whose streets? Our streets” and “New 
Haven is not for sale!” Cops eventually escorted 
the protestors out of city hall as they belted the 1931 
United Mine Workers union song “Which Side Are 
You On.” After a short recess, the protestors were let 
back in, and the vote was conducted: the sale passed 
twenty one to eight. The city needed to fill a hole in 
its annual budget, and an immediate infusion of $3 
million proved too tempting for a majority of alders 
to turn down.
Two pairs of waist-height black plastic signs 
bookend Wall between College and High. The signs 
read “CLOSED TO TRAFFIC” in white serif font 
on a blue background, an unmistakable graphic 
identity.  This blue-and-white signature, a low-profile 
marker of an urban crusade, defines Yale’s territory 
within New Haven.

Yale is slowly pedestrianizing streets that run 
through campus. What does this mean for the 
city?
