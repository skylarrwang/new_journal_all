O
n the first day of my language program, our 
teachers warn us not to be surprised if anyone 
Chinese tells us, “You’ve gotten fatter.” This is not 
considered rude in China, she explains, merely a 
habitual way of greeting a friend or acquaintance.
No culture shock here. At family banquets in 
China, which my sister and I attended every few 
years, I grew used to the aunties, whose faces I often 
can’t recall, telling me how big, how fat I’ve become. 
They would make these remarks amiably, often 
smiling, counterintuitively filling my plate with 
more needle-boned fish, pinching the parts of my 
stomach that have changed. Any foreigner should 
know Chinese people are not like Americans; they 
are eager to point out anything different.

In Harbin, a classmate and I visit a local wholesale 
market to hunt for cheap clothing. We’re both Asian 
American. At a small shop selling sundresses, the 
vendor manning the stand notices our accents, the 
way we can’t seem to curl our tongues to pronounce 
r words.
She says, “You are not from here.”
We think only of bargaining. We explain that 
we’re foreigners, Americans actually. We traveled so 
far to look for affordable clothing. Can you give us 
some better prices? A little cheaper, maybe?
The vendor is not interested in business. 
“Americans? Why do you look like that?” She steps 
closer, studying our non-American faces. Another 
vendor joins her. They pinch our clothing, look 
down our shirts, move their faces closer to our 
skin, still giggling at each other, Why do they look
like that?
“We’re Americans,” we repeat as they flock us, 
though I’m unsure whom we are addressing. 
We reach to part the bead curtain hanging over 
the store’s exit. When we duck out, they point 
after us: Are you sure they’re not Chinese? Other 
vendowrs come out to look at us, looking after our 
running silhouettes.

Mandarin was my mother tongue. I grew up 
speaking it until I didn’t. It feels odd to relearn a 
language that I once knew so seamlessly, to say a 
word and realize I can no longer pronounce it.
In my language program, a portion of the class is 
devoted to reviewing and pronouncing new 
vocabulary words. Our teacher holds up words 
on a flashcard, we read them back as accurately 
as possible.
I sense there are different standards for different 
students. The teachers are more forgiving toward 
mistakes made by non-Asian students. In a class with 
mostly white students, I pronounce a word slightly 
incorrectly. The teacher singles me out.
“Wrong,” she says, “say it again.”
I say it.
“Repeat it,” she says, “again.”
I’ve been asked by multiple strangers if I plan on 
returning to guonei, or “the Mainland,” after college. 
I explain to them that I was born in the United States. 
I’m an American. They question me further. How, 
then, do I look Chinese? Some strangers in China 
don’t bother me with more questions. Instead, 
they get upset, hurl insults, and insist that I am not 
American, just delusional, arrogant, and Chinese.
In Mandarin, there’s a phrase       ,   (wangben), 
that means “forgetting everything.” It’s used to 
signify the worst kind of forgetting, a kind similar to 
amnesia, a kind hard to forgive—one that makes it 
hard to recall what you’ve lost.


I hear this for the first time on a taxi ride to the 
Beijing airport. A particularly curious driver keeps 
asking me which Chinese CEOs I admire, so I tell 
him I don’t know many, I’m an American.
Laughing, he says, “Then you have really wangben,” 
and I feel guilty. I feel this guilt when I’m overheard 
speaking English on the bus; when not remembering 
the faces of my relatives; when traveling to another 
country to relearn my mother tongue; when looking 
at my language teacher as I repeat a word I used to 
know, as she reiterates, Again, remember, again.

We Americans, Asian-Americans, and other 
hyphenated Americans are said to have the advantage 
of having one foot in each nation. The downside to 
this is that we flounder, struggle to find our balance. 
We are never rooted to one cohesive identity. 
I don’t find comfort in a purely American identity. 
America is the white parent asking if I eat dog at 
home. America is chink, is love me long time. America 
is the elementary school teacher telling me to speak 
normal. Not in Chinese. America is my parents calling 
my white friends “American,” my Chinese American 
friends “Chinese.” America is the child staring at 
me from the front of the bus, pulling his eyes into 
slits, grinning.
In China, I can’t deny that I feel less foreign and 
interesting and more alien, the result of a ghastly 
intercultural experiment. Even so, I don’t find 
much comfort in the other country that claims my 
nationality, that implicitly taught me through years 
of racism—internalized, systemic, and overt—that 
speaking Chinese is useless, so I should just forget it. 

Most Chinese Americans who have been to China 
believe that ABCs—Chinese slang for “American-
born Chinese” receive different treatment than 
foreigners who look visibly foreign. I am grateful for 
the ability to slip through crowds unnoticed, to ride 
the subway without strangers snapping furtive photos 
of me. Nonetheless, when Chinese people breach the 
topic of nationality and identity, that’s when ABCs are 
paid the most attention.
“If you’re American, then how do you look 
Chinese?” During this program, the origin of this 
question becomes clear. For Chinese nationals, 
who have the idea that a nation must be “ethnically 
harmonious” for decades, nationality is inextricably 
tied to race. Thus, for them and for many others, 
American identity is inextricably tied to whiteness.
Sometimes this makes me sad—this idea that I have 
no nationality to claim without constantly defending 
it. I think about how I’ll never feel fully comfortable 
standing for the Pledge of Allegiance; how I am 
simultaneously 
geographically, 
culturally, 
and 
politically removed from the country my parents 
left twenty years ago. I don’t find comfort in this 
idea that I’m thrashing between nations, merely 
treading seawater. 
At the same time, I reflect on how when governments 
attempt to tie race to nationality, it’s usually done to 
systematically oppress and terrorize those who fall in 
the margins—Muslims who are not Han Chinese, 
bodies that are not white. Do I need to participate in 
this? Do I need to identify with one nationality over 
the other, or can I exist and thrive in the margins?

White or white-passing Americans in China have 
the privilege of performing foreignness, or what can be 
perceived as a genuine American identity. We ABCs 
can only mimic it. Chinese people are fascinated 
by white Americans speaking Chinese, even with 
an accent it’s exotic. When I speak Chinese with an 
American accent—cultural treason.
One day during my program, a few American 
students and I are treated to lunch by a Chinese 
study abroad company. To the white students, the 
company’s employees are magnanimous. They pile 
dumplings on the students’ plates—Which kinds do 
you like? Eat more!—and are amused by their ability 
to say haochi—“it tastes good.” They listen to their 
experiences, ask engaging questions: How did you 
start learning Chinese? It’s very good!
I keep waiting for them to ask me questions, for the 
dumplings to be placed on my plate, for the 
compliments regarding my Chinese ability. Soon, 
the lazy Susan spins, staggeringly, toward me, but no 
one’s chopsticks rush to transfer chive dumplings to 
my plate. I wait until I realize I have to help myself.
