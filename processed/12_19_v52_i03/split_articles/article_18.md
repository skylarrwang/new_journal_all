Eating at Yale was once an unsavory affair. 
Young men subsisted on salt beef, dry cod, 
and the occasional apple ‘pye’: a doughy 
dessert prepared with sugar, hog’s lard, and a peck 
of apples. Wars brought shortages, and at times, the 
students found the food so unbearable that they threw 
the boiled beef on the floor and the rancid butter out 
the windows. In the “Bread and Butter Rebellion” of 
1828, a group of them went on strike, unsuccessfully, 
against the central dining hall, Commons, for its 
unsatisfactory offerings. 

In the fifty-four years since anthropologist Loomis 
Havemeyer published Eating at Yale: 1701–1965, almost 
everything about the dining experience has changed. 
Ceramic plateware, spa water, and self-service replaced 
the Yale china, hard cider, and butlers. Menus evolved 
to serve more global food. And yet, the philosophy 
behind eating at Yale has remained constant: it’s not 
really about the food. Eating at Yale is about sitting, 
thinking, and talking. 

But as students engage in conversation over Char 
Sui Ramen and Brownie Walnut Pudding, most do not 
realize that we live in a country where food waste is the 
largest and least recycled portion of the waste stream 
and in a city where 22 percent of residents lack steady 
access to healthy and affordable food.

Yale University oversees twenty-three residential 
and retail dining operations and serves an average of 
fourteen thousand meals each day. The scale of this 
operation means that the way the University considers 
larger issues of food waste and food insecurity can have 
a significant impact.       

What happens before we eat is a familiar story. Yale 
Dining strives to source food locally and limit food 
waste during production. Dining staff turn unattractive 
tomato “seconds” into salsa and misshapen pumpkins 
into ravioli. They employ a “nose-to-tail” philosophy; 
if broccoli florets are the vegetable du jour, the stems 
are used in soups, and the leaves are featured in salad 
bars. To improve campus “food literacy,” Yale sponsors 
local farm tours to teach students about its sustainable 
procurement practices. Come autumn, ninety mostly 
flannel-clad undergraduates flock to nearby farms to 
ride tractors through pumpkin patches and pick apples 
from trees in a vision of pastoral bliss.     

But the largely untold story of where our food goes 
after we eat can help elucidate Yale’s role in the New 
Haven food ecosystem. Where are the Yale-sponsored 
tours of the places Yale sends its food once students are 
done eating?           

What happens to the food Yale doesn’t eat?

It’s lunchtime in your favorite residential college 
dining hall, and you’re clearing your dishes and waving 
goodbye to your friends. You scrape what remains of 
your red lentil pasta and garbanzo bean salad into the 
food waste bin. You speed to your seminar, pull up your 
readings, and spend the next hour trying to come up 
with a vaguely intelligent thought to share in class. You 
have long since forgotten your lunch.  

As you carry on with your day, your red lentil pasta 
and garbanzo bean salad sit in a bin with the other half-
eaten and uneaten foods. Once or twice daily, a Yale 
truck collects the food scraps from your meal and the 
other 13,999 served that day. Your lunch travels thirty-
three miles on I-91 North to Southington, Connecticut. 
The truck turns onto Depaolo Drive and pulls up 
to a large white structure on an expanse of black tar, 
nestled between an evergreen forest and rust-colored 
piles of mulch and topsoil. Men in bright yellow 
hoodies wander the grounds to monitor the cylindrical 
tanks and the magic happening inside them. Atop the 
largest of six tanks, an American flag waves in the wind.

Quantum Biopower is Connecticut’s first food waste-
to-energy facility and the only anaerobic digester on the 
East Coast. In 2011, Connecticut issued a food diversion 
mandate that requires large commercial businesses 
that produce 104 tons or more of food waste per year 
to send their food scraps to a state-licensed recycling 
operation, so long as there is such an operation within 
twenty miles. Though colleges and universities are 
exempt from the 2011 mandate, Yale, striving to be a 
leader on the sustainability front, opted to comply. 

In late 2016, the University became one of Quantum 
Biopower’s first customers.

The Yale truck parks in Quantum’s reception bay and 
empties the day’s load into a murky brown pool that the 
company’s vice president Brian Paganini calls a “really 
gross milkshake.” The stench of rotting food pervades 
the air as Yale’s food scraps mix with waste from 
nearby supermarkets, hotels, hospitals, and seven other 
colleges and universities. A violent churning separates 
inorganic materials from the organic ones before 
the milkshake is fed to the digester: a titanic oxygen-
deprived steel tank that holds one million gallons of 
liquefied waste at a low-pH, high-temperature setting. 
Microscopic bacteria in the digester consume the food 
waste with constant oversight from the Quantum team. 
“You can’t give the bacteria the whole Thanksgiving 
meal one day, or it won’t eat the next,” said Director of 
Operations John Ferguson. He described the anaerobic 
digester as an infant in its early days—the bacteria’s first 
‘meal’ was milk from a nearby dairy supplier—that has 
since blossomed into a hungry teenager that will eat 
basically anything.

As the bacteria consume the liquefied waste, they 
expel methane. “It’s a biological process,” said Paganini. 
“No different than a cow’s stomach or the human 
body.” Quantum’s state-of-the-art tanks harness the 
methane to create electricity. Southington buys back 
some of the electricity at a discounted rate to power its 
wastewater plants, municipal buildings, police station, 
and fire station. 

So far in 2019, Yale trucks have delivered over 
850 tons of food waste to the Quantum facility. The 
Quantum operation recycles forty-thousand tons of 
food waste each year, generating 420 thousand cubic 
feet of contained methane and enough electricity to 
theoretically power 775 homes with clean energy each. 
     One of the main advantages of anaerobic digestion 
is that it keeps the methane contained, harnessing 
the emissions as fuel for energy creation. Traditional 
composting, which turns organic waste into soil and 
fertilizer, allows some methane to escape into the 
atmosphere, contributing to global warming. While 
Yale’s partnership with Quantum Biopower diverts 
waste from landfills and incinerators, the University’s 
food disposal system isn’t perfect. For one, food waste 
bins are only available to students in dining halls, 
during dining hall hours. This system fails to capture 
food waste generated from Yale’s robust snacking and 
buttery culture. Secondly, diners often put into waste 
bins things that cannot be processed at the facility. 
According to Ferguson, Quantum recently contacted 
Yale about silverware, trays, tools, and even brooms 
mixed in with the food scraps. The machinery can 
scrape out this contamination, but only at a volume of 
5 to 10 percent of incoming material.      

On college campuses, every eater plays a role in 
optimizing sustainable operations. To estimate how 
much food to purchase, Yale Dining uses data-driven 
meal forecasting based on two years of historical data. 
If all students adhered to Yale Dining’s “take what 
you eat, and eat what you take” philosophy, a message 
printed rather inconspicuously on dining hall fliers, 
the data would reflect small behavioral changes and 
eventually lead to purchasing reductions.

Natalie Warren, who graduated from Yale in 2017, 
tackled the issue of university food waste in her 
cognitive science thesis. She sees food waste as a 
cooperative dilemma since students must expend some 
costly effort (taking the appropriate amount of food) 
to promote a public good (reducing food waste). For 
her thesis, she implemented a cooperation-inspired 
marketing campaign in half of the college dining halls, 
fastening endearing posters to napkin dispensers and 
bulletin boards with slogans like “Second Time’s A 
Charm: Take only what you eat and go back for seconds 
if you’re still hungry. #cleanplateclub.” The six dining 
halls with the marketing intervention saw a statistically 
significant reduction in dinnertime food waste at an 
average of .01 pounds per person per day, or about 
sixteen pounds per day. Later iterations of Warren’s 
signs still adorn dining halls today, reminding students 
to consume with intention. 

Edmund Chute, a senior at Yale, and Chris Chute, 
who graduated two years ago, are taking a technological 
approach to campus food waste generated outside of the 
dining hall. This fall, the brothers launched Vulture, 
an app designed to provide students with fast, accurate 
information about every source of free food on campus. 
Students post a picture, description, and the location 
of any surplus food. Other users receive a notification 
with directions and updates should the Insomnia 
cookies or Popeyes biscuits run out before they arrive. 
“We think the best way to reduce food waste is to create 
a platform for notifying people, telling them when food 
is available, and making it fun to go get it,” said Chris 
Chute. The app has launched at Yale and Harvard, and 
the Chute brothers hope to expand to other campuses 
across the country.

Still, the scale of the problem is enormous. In the 
United States today, more than thirty-six million tons 
of food are sent to methane-releasing landfills and 
ash- and soot-producing incinerators. It would take 
an additional 910 facilities like Quantum Biopower to 
divert all this waste and turn it into energy. Quantum 
is already running at 95 percent capacity, so the team 
sees tremendous opportunity for growth in the state of 
Connecticut and across America. “Anaerobic digestion 
is at the nexus between recycling and energy. In the 
United States, this whole industry is very much in 
its infancy,” said Paganini. “Recovering food waste is 
the last portion of the waste stream that really needs 
attention. It’s the final frontier of recycling.” 

But there are still many barriers. Not all states have 
mandates like Connecticut’s, and even Connecticut’s 
mandate is poorly enforced. Developing, permitting, 
and financing anaerobic digestion facilities is an 
expensive endeavor that requires community support, 
and many people have a not-in-my-backyard attitude 
toward waste, Ferguson said. Without these facilities, 
the onus falls entirely on institutions and individuals 
to reduce waste.

Not all food Yale Dining cooks is digested by its 
student body and Quantum bacteria. As Yale’s food 
scraps make the daily trek to the anaerobic digester, 
Yale’s untouched leftovers travel a shorter distance: 
to the soup kitchens, daycare centers, elderly housing 
apartments, and faith communities in New Haven that 
feed some of the University’s food-insecure neighbors.      

If the algorithms for predicting food volume were 
perfect, Yale Dining wouldn’t have any leftovers 
to donate, but a sprawling, buffet-style food service 
operation makes excess inevitable. On Fridays and 
Saturdays, Yale student volunteers pick up some of 
these leftovers from the residential college dining halls. 
They drive around twenty pans of food to the United 
Parish House at the corner of Temple and Wall Street, 
home to the Downtown Evening Soup Kitchen, or 
DESK. Since 1987, DESK has provided weekday meals 
to New Haven residents experiencing homelessness 
or poverty. In 2005, students working with the Yale 
Hunger and Homelessness Action Project extended 
DESK service to weekends by launching the Yale
