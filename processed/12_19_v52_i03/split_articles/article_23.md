THE  NEW  JOURNAL
T
he first boy I loved at Yale won my heart 
in the core of Sterling Memorial Library. 


After dinner at Berkeley one September night, 
he told me that he’d happened upon a book he thought 
I would enjoy, so he’d put it on hold for me, and would 
I like to go with him and pick it up? We put away our 
dishes, and we made our way to the Sterling Hold Shelf, 
where he had requested Philip Gross’s Mappa Mundi. It 
was my first visit to the Hold Shelf, and walking past the 
rows of alphabetized volumes to the shelf labeled “Q” 
(the first letter of his last name), I could think of nothing 
more romantic than having a dangerously pretty boy 
make a book of poetry materialize out of the stacks for 
my reading pleasure. I affectionately clutched the slim 
green volume to my chest. 


The boy and I are no longer speaking; in fact, when 
the book was due months later, I’ll admit, I considered 
holding onto it so he’d be beset with late fees. In the 
two years that have passed since that night, I’ve been a 
frequent guest at the Hold Shelf, and I’ve never gotten 
over the rush of swiping in to retrieve a book set aside 
especially for me. 


I guess in a place with millions of volumes, an entire 
room qualifies as a “shelf.” The Hold Shelf’s entrance, 
a trio of forest-green leather doors studded with brass 
nails, stands below “Alma Mater,” a mural by Yale 
alum Eugene Savage depicting a celestial Mother 
Knowledge flanked by her devotees. The Hold Shelf is 
the library’s middle child. It lacks the majesty of the 
nave, whose name gestures at Sterling’s cathedral-like 
nature. (Yale Tour Guide Legend™ has it that in the 
late 1920s, architect James Gamble Rogers wanted to 
design a chapel for Yale but received the commission 
to design a library instead, so he concocted the most 
cathedral-like library he could muster.) Sterling opened 
in 1931; the Hold Shelf opened in 2013 as part of a $20 
million modernization of the nave. 


But entering the Hold Shelf from the grandeur 
of the nave—stone arches, coffered ceiling, stained 
glass windows—reveals a startlingly utilitarian space. 
White chain-link fencing quite literally cordons it off 
from the endless stacks. Each shelf, where holds are 
grouped by last name of the requester, are also chained 
off. Compared to the abundance of the stacks, the 
shelves never look quite full enough. The lights are 
at once aggressively fluorescent and too dim. It’s a 
fundamentally transactional space; most customers at 
the hold shelf go in because they require a book and 
leave once they’ve retrieved it. This efficiency is what 
the 2013 renovations were all about: combining the 
previously disparate desks of Circulation, Information, 
and Library Privileges into one desk and using the 
space freed up at the end of the nave for self-service 
check-out, workstations, and of course, the Hold Shelf. 


This automated expediency is magical to me. At the 
Hold Shelf, I can request book after book, and print 
copies of Yale’s nearly 15 million volumes appear 
just like an Amazon Prime Delivery (but without the 
ethical compromises). “Get it @ Yale,” the web page 
that outlines the university’s various methods of book 
delivery, speaks to its Internet Age immediacy. Access 
needs aside, it’s this same acquisitive rush that fuels 
online shopping addictions and the willingness to pay 
exorbitant delivery fees on UberEats. 


Much like Amazon Prime, the near-instantaneous 
acquisition and online request system can obscure 
the work that goes into maintaining “the beast” that 
is Sterling Memorial Library, as my friend Mia Arias-
Tsang put it. Mia worked in the Stacks department of 
Sterling through her first two years. “There’s a lot more 
work that goes into it than one might think,” she noted. 
“And it’s almost completely run by students.” 


In my frequent visits, it’s rare that I actually see 
someone on shift at the Hold Shelf. But on one mid-
morning trip, I pause at the dry erase board at the 
back of the room, which cheerily announces that it’s 
a “Magnificent Monday.” The tasks spelled out on the 
board reveal the hidden hands that keep the shelf in 
order: 8-9: Removed unwanted holds, pulled expired 
books—WS; 9-10: Shelved, Accuracy Check A-M—DB; 
10-11: Sh. books, Acc. Check C.A./S.R. 


Some of Mia’s work in the Stacks Department 
involved prepping books for their journey down to 
the shelf. Discharge, the process of scanning books 
returned to Sterling and re-sorting them for their 
prospective readers, was her favorite part of the job (not 
only because it was the one part where she was allowed 
to sit down).


As she printed the tickets, she’d look out for names 
she recognized to see what her friends were reading, 
and over time she came to know a few of the Hold Shelf 
regulars. “I’d never have met them in my life, but I’d see 
they’d have a whole bunch of books on something super 
obscure like Catholic Art History or the Crusades,” 
Mia said. “There’d be like 20 books on the crusades for 
one person, and I’d be like ‘Damn, hope Christopher 
Martinez is having a good time researching this.’” 


In the years that Mia worked at Sterling, I’d look 
forward to the photos she’d send when she came across 
my name during her shelving shifts. There, at the shelf 
marked “V” for Vázquez, I picked up books that would 
become fundamental to my life and research like 
Dionne Brand’s The Blue Clerk or books I requested but 
never opened like The Company He Keeps: A History of 
White College Fraternities. I still remember the blustery 
January day my sophomore year when I took refuge 
in the warmth of the Hold Shelf to pick up Yarimar 
Bonilla’s Non-Sovereign Futures. It’s a foundational 
book for my research in French Caribbean poetics, 
and after discovering the introduction in PDF form 
freshman year, it was finally in my hands. It felt like 
something was beginning. I may not have ever finished 
Mappi Mundi, but it was the Hold Shelf that won my 
heart that September night. Alma Mater was more 
visible to me inside those forest-green doors than at the 
mural outside; light and truth were always waiting for 
me there.
