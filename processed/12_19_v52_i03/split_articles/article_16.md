THE  NEW  JOURNAL
Justin Elicker, New Haven’s mayor-elect who was 
an alder during the controversy in 2013, told me 
about his opposition to the sale: selling the street 
eliminates the city’s “ability to choose how to use 
that street in the future” and “the amount that was 
being offered was very, very low.”


Doug Hausladen, another alder at the time, also 
voted against the deal. He now serves as the director 
for Transportation, Parking, & Traffic for New 
Haven. On my bike ride down to the Clerk’s Office 
to retrieve Board of Alders meeting minutes, I spotted 
him. I had been trying to reach him, but my emails 
kept getting sucked into the bureaucratic vortex. As 
he was getting out of a silver Buick, I recognized 
his bearded face and shouted, “Doug!” Briefcase in 
hand, he halted his beeline towards the municipal 
building at 200 Orange Street and turned to face me. 
I introduced myself, but he seemed to be in a rush, 
so we exchanged phone numbers and agreed on a 
time to speak the next day.


What upset Hausladen most about the street sale 
was its indefinite nature. Even though Yale assured 
the Board of Alders that it would keep the street open 
to the walking public after the purchase, Hausladen 
argued, “You and I both can see a world where there 
is no way to legally hold them to that.” Current plans 
indicate the new plaza will remain accessible to 
everyone, but Yale’s ownership effectively stretches 
to infinity. “Forever is a long time. Put it that way,” 
Hausladen said. “Even I have a really hard time 
understanding what forever is.”


Hausladen sees the university’s tendency to buy 
and close off vehicular space as a mission to isolate 
the campus from the city. In fact, fifty years ago, Elm 
Street almost went the way Wall has gone today. But 
instead of peaceful protests, there were aggressive 
altercations, revealing that New Haven’s streets are 
an arena of town-gown tensions.


Before Morse and Stiles were built in the early 
1960s, the northwest border of campus was defined 
by two high schools: Commercial and Hillhouse. 
Every afternoon at 2:30, students would make their 
way home after school down Elm Street, and Yalies 
would heckle and pelt them with snowballs. The 
high school students would jeer back, “if you can’t 
get a date, get a Yalie.” “There was a long period 
in which Elm Street was a place of high tension,” 
veteran Yale administrator Sam Chauncey explained 
to me. 


When I met Chauncey in Atticus cafe, he was 
sitting alone at a large round table casually sipping 
an iced tea. Without getting up, he extended his 
hand for a shake, warmly inviting me to sit down. 
Chauncey began working for the Yale administration 
immediately after graduating in 1957, and by 1963 
he was appointed special assistant to University 
President Kingman Brewster. After working for Yale 
for almost 30 years, Chauncey is now retired and 
These four signs, in conjunction with new paving, 
bike racks, and benches, represent the first stage of 
Yale’s latest project to pedestrianize Wall Street. The 
Yale Daily News reported in September that by 2020, 
Yale plans to have cordoned off an additional block 
of Wall as well as an adjacent block of High Street 
so as to surround the forthcoming Schwarzman 
Center, renovated student life complex, with verdant 
walkable plazas.

lives in New Haven, volunteering as a student advisor 
for Yale College and giving alumni talks.


Last spring I wrote an op-ed in the Yale Daily News 
about jaywalking on Elm Street, in which I had jokingly 
proposed routing cars through an underground tunnel 
to keep street-crossers safe from oncoming traffic. Right 
after the article ran, Chauncey emailed me to say that 
Yale had actually explored that very idea in the 1960s. 
I sat down with him to see what he remembered about 
the initiative.


Chauncey explained that town-gown tension 
reached its zenith on March 17, 1959, during the annual 
St. Patrick’s Day parade down Elm Street.


“There had been a very early snowstorm. Wet snow. 
Perfect snowball snow,” Chauncey said. As the parade 
progressed down Elm, hundreds of Yale students began 
to bombard the paraders with their hard-packed, snowy 
projectiles. Some aggressors posted up on the upper 
floors of what was then Calhoun College, turning dorm 
rooms into makeshift turrets. New Haven Police chased 
students into college courtyards, swinging nightsticks. 
An all-out brawl ensued, students beating officers, 
officers beating students. 


The following morning, the Yale Daily News reported 
that “for an hour yesterday afternoon New Haven had 
the appearance of being a city at war.” A photograph 
taken during the riot shows a Nazi flag displayed in the 
window of a room in Hopper College, a sign that bigotry 
had been swirling around parts of the student body. A 
2001 issue of the Yale Alumni Magazine reported that 
the riot was thought to be motivated by anti-Catholic 
sentiment towards the St. Patrick’s Day paraders. 
“All hell broke loose,” Chauncey said. “I mean it was 
a nightmare. I was a young assistant dean then, and it 
was awful.” So awful, actually, “that the mayor of New 
Haven and the president of Yale, who were very good 
friends, wouldn’t speak to each other for three or four 
months.”


But the two administrators eventually collaborated: 
on March 31st, New Haven mayor Richard C. Lee 
and Yale president A. Whitney Griswold announced 
the formation of the Commission to Study Yale-New 
Haven Community Relations, made up of  a retired 
Connecticut chief justice, a former Yale athletic 
director, and a New Haven police commissioner.


In September 1959, the commission published a 
report on town-gown relations. The document devoted 
an entire section to “Traffic,” recommending “routing 
vehicular traffic underground” on Elm for two blocks 
from York to College (from what is today the Patagonia 
store to Hopper College). This newly freed space would 
possibly “be integrated in the campus” so that “New 
Haven and her citizens as well as Yale would benefit.” 
Desperate to resolve the Elm Street question, Lee 
offered to help fund studies for the project: “Dear 
Whit, I am sure we can find the $2,100 to do our share 
of the engineering job on the Elm Street tunnel,” Lee 
wrote in a letter to Yale president A. Whitney Griswold 
on October 30, 1959. Lee was an urban renewal poster 
child, famous for razing ‘blighted’ areas across New 
Haven to make way for new highways. So it comes as 
no surprise that he was keen to help Griswold with a 
monolithic auto infrastructure project along Elm, one 
that would conveniently result in new space for Yale’s 
elite.


Despite the collaborative effort, the tunneling project 
was never completed. The Elm Street Underpass 
report, conducted by a New York-based engineering 
firm, estimated that the tunneling would cost over $3 
million: too high for the University. The infrastructure 
under Elm, such as electrical connections and water 
lines, also prohibited a full excavation of the street. 
Yale administrators continued to explore the idea 
throughout the 1960s. Even though Morse and Stiles 
took the place of the high schools, Yale liked the 
concept of a unified campus. Correspondence as late 
as 1966 suggests the university continued to entertain 
the idea of a tunnel beneath Elm Street. But nothing 
ever materialized. 


“Elm Street today is kind of a sad street in my way of 
thinking,” Chauncey said. Taking his napkin from his 
lap, he began wistfully drawing what he dreamed Elm 
could look like now, thinking out loud along the way.

Chauncey illustrated how he would remove a lane of 
traffic and add dozens of pin oak trees flanking the 
street. (He was very intent on the pin oaks, insisting, 
“If you prune them high, fifteen feet, they create a 
canopy.”)


Much of Chauncey’s explanation was admittedly 
very difficult to follow—the details of his vision 
were hard to decipher from his napkin drawing—
but his sentiment was crystal clear. City streets 
create fractures in what could be a more complete 
campus, which could serve as an amenity not only 
to Yalies but to New Haven residents, too. Chauncey 
recounted a story of a New Haven resident he knew 
who worked on Park Street and would walk home 
through the colleges, before the gates were locked to 
the public, because she felt safer that way.


“Nothing broke my heart more than when 
we decided we had to lock all the college gates,” 
Chauncey said. “We don’t do anything, in an urban 
sense, to welcome the citizens of New Havens onto 
the Yale campus.” 


For years, Chauncey has worked to repair town-
gown relations. In 1972, he started Yale’s Community 
Relations Office, a group that has worked on 
charitable projects like New Haven Promise, New 
Haven Reads, and Squash Haven. If I knew about 
all the generous contributions Yale makes to New 
Haven, I’d be “astounded,” he told me. “It isn’t just 
the $11 million, it’s a whole lot of other stuff.”


But in Chauncey’s eyes, Yale’s commitment to New 
Haven has deteriorated significantly. I asked him if 
the current administration was making any effort, 
but he cut me off before I could finish my question: 
“Absolutely not. I am appalled. And I’ve told him, so 
I don’t mind saying it, but I am appalled at how little 
Peter Salovey is interested in the relationship other 
than nice words.”


Chauncey’s 
rhetoric 
about 
pedestrianization 
conveys a belief that walkable areas will benefit 
everyone. But his work on the 1960s Elm Street 
tunneling project also shows an intention to isolate 
the campus. “After that snowball riot we all talked 
about tunneling underneath and closing that street 
off,” he said. These seemingly opposite impulses left 
me confused, wondering whether Chauncey’s ideas 
about walkable spaces would only end up solidifying 
the town-gown divide.


My interviews with Chauncey and Hausladen, 
roughly a week apart, felt like a staged debate on 
Yale’s relationship with New Haven. If they were 
in the same room, the discourse would be, let’s say, 
passionate.  


Chauncey thinks a more pedestrianized campus 
would help make Yale more “appealing and 
welcoming… Even for the citizens of New Haven, 
just walking home. It becomes a more pleasant trip.”


Hausladen passionately refuted this notion, 
explaining that foot traffic and auto traffic are 
inherently at odds. “Yalies want pedestrianism 
and the region of New Haven is a vehicular-based 
region,” he argued. The prioritization of pedestrians 
would constrict New Haven’s auto thoroughfares 
and prevent commuters from efficiently getting to 
work, in order to “take all the space back just for 
Yalies’ use.”


After such intense controversy over outlandish 
tunneling projects, closing arterial streets, and the 
relative values of pedestrians and drivers in the 
context of the university and the city, the four small 
signs bookending a block of Wall Street may seem 
inconsequential. Closing Wall St. to cars won’t 
significantly impact traffic patterns, and it doesn’t 
formally exclude New Haveners from walking in 
that space. But a pedestrian space is not necessarily 
a neutral space. The Elm Street plan of old and 
today’s Wall Street project both reflect an effort to 
isolate Yale from New Haven, a city that is so often 
portrayed by Yalies as rundown, depressed, or dreary.


There’s a future in which I return to Yale to find 
wrought-iron gates guarding the entrance to Wall 
Street that beep upon the swipe of an ID. It’s really 
not too hard to imagine—just think of Old Campus, 
which had its gates locked in 1976. But isolation does 
not always come in the form of physical barriers. 
Even if Wall is never formally closed off, its purchase 
and pedestrianization serve as a reminder of Yale’s 
tendency to co-opt public urban space in the name 
of campus continuity.  Maybe on Wall we are already 
witnessing a barrier under construction.
