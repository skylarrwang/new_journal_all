states, “Despite the public concern, clearcutting may 
be called upon where mature trees are in poor health or 
condition due to ice damage, insect infestation or other 
disturbances, or to create habitat for birds and mammals 
requiring larger patches of early-successional forest.” 
Could anyone really analyze Wagner’s practices from 
just a few satellite images, without knowing why and to 
what extent they actually engaged in those practices? 
Samson and Montgomery refer to the satellite images as 
indisputable evidence of Wagner’s ill management. But 
my doubt lingered.


After meeting with Samson and Montgomery, I 
reached out to Kevin Evans, the manager of Dartmouth’s 
timberland—called the Second College Grant. Evans 
thinks that sustainable forestry is pretty straightforward. 
“My goal is that I don’t cut anymore than I grow,” he said. 
The Second College Grant does not belong to Dartmouth’s 
endowment, but it is managed for profit and, according 
to its website, “provides revenue for student scholarship.” 
Evans calls the forest “an investment property,” but unlike 
the Yale Investments Office, Dartmouth uses its woodland 
for research and outdoor recreation, not only timber 
harvesting. Evans declined to comment on Wagner’s 
management. The most he would say about Yale is, “They 
don’t want to tell people what’s there.” 


I decided to go see what the people at Wagner would 
or would not tell me. When I arrived unannounced at 
Wagner’s field office in Errol, a white-bearded man in 
dark jeans and a red-and-black flannel button-down 
ushered me into the small office. I was shocked to be 
welcomed so amicably and even more surprised that, after 
a few minutes of rather awkward conversation, the man, 
Raymond Berthiaume, harvest planning and operations 
manager, agreed to speak with me. Berthiaume oversees 
more than 500,000 acres of land in New Hampshire and 
western Maine, mostly owned by Bayroot.


Berthiaume’s initial response to my concerns about 
Wagner’s logging practices was that the company is 
certified as “sustainable” by third-party auditors. In fact, 
Berthiaume told me, one of those companies—Sustainable 
Forestry Initiative, or SFI—was out on Wagner’s land 
auditing the company as we spoke. He said one or both of 
the auditors, the other called Forest Stewardship Council, 
or FSC, checks up on Wagner every year. The company’s 
website confirms that the certifications are “a critical part 
of Wagner’s business model” and guarantee “an objective 
evaluation of Wagner’s sustainability efforts.” The Yale 
Investments Office made a similar argument in a 2017 
press release, calling Wagner “a world-class manager of 
timberland.”


Montgomery and Samson had told me that the green 
certifications do not mean much, that it is not that hard 
to become certified and that Wagner and other timber 
companies actually pay for the certifications—a potential 
conflict of interest. But Berthiaume insisted that the 
auditors are entirely independent and have high standards. 
(Other foresters I have interviewed similarly dispelled 
claims that the auditors lack independence.) 


Compared to Yale’s secretive ownership, Berthiaume’s 
candor was refreshing. “I’d say Bayroot is probably the 
number one or two largest private landowners in the 
state,” he said. “If you’re driving through northern New 
Hampshire, there’s better than a 75 percent chance 
you’re looking at Bayroot-owned land.” Besides, many of 
Berthiaume’s points made perfect sense: “Wagner is in the 
business of managing timberland, so it’s in our interest 
to keep the timberland timberland. And, why would we 
change that? That’s cutting ourselves out of a job, and 
that’s not a good business plan.”


Berthiaume also denied Samson and Montgomery’s 
claims that Wagner engages in unsustainable practices 
like clearcutting. He fell back on the fact that Wagner 
has been certified as “sustainable” by two independent 
auditors. 


But as Coos County resident and environmental 
journalist Jamie Sayen would later tell me, “If you had 
a hundred people in a room and you asked them to 
write down the definition of ‘sustainable,’ you would 
have a hundred different definitions.” It occurred to me 
that maybe—likely, in fact—neither Montgomery nor 
Berthiaume was lying. They were just operating under 
different understandings of “sustainable.” 


Local opposition to Wagner’s forest management and 
to Yale’s furtive presence in Coos County extends beyond 
the logging question. In November 2012, Wagner leased 
a 24-mile stretch of Bayroot land in Coos County to 
Eversource Energy, an energy conglomerate planning to 
build a hydro-electric transmission line, called Northern 
Pass, from Quebec to Massachusetts. (The financial details 
of the lease were not publicly disclosed.) Eversource had 
been buying up land from local residents, trying to carve 
out a contiguous route for the $1.6 billion power cable 
through northern New Hampshire. Private landowners 
and environmental groups banded together to oppose the

project, which they argued would harm the landscape 
and hurt property value. Bayroot’s land was key. “Without 
Bayroot I don’t know if [Eversource] could have done it,” 
said Chris Jensen, a former reporter for New Hampshire 
Public Radio who covered the controversy in its early 
stages.  


News of Yale’s involvement with Bayroot only added to 
the opposition movement’s narrative of an out-of-touch 
corporation taking advantage of a small rural community. 
In a January 2018 Yale Daily News op-ed, Samson wrote that 
the transmission line would, among other harmful things, 
“mar forests that we have depended on and enjoyed for 
centuries.” Yale, Samson argued, “is extracting significant 
wealth from Coos County.” Charlie Jordan, who owns and 
edits the Colebrook Chronicle—a local weekly paper—
said Northern Pass is the only issue his paper has ever 
taken a stand on. “This was the fundamental crux of why 
people live here” 


In May 2017, Samson, Montgomery, and a few fellow 
Coos County residents traveled five hours to Yale to 
participate in a teach-in alongside student activists. Samson 
and the students also visited the School of Forestry hoping 
to meet with dean Indy Burke, but Samson said she was 
not there. He said upon returning home he received a call 
from the Yale police, who told him he might be arrested if 
he went back to Yale’s campus. (Samson does not have a 
record of the call.) Unfazed, Samson returned to campus 
in October 2017 to deliver a petition to the Investments 
Office, but he was barred entry. “I was not a dissident until 
I visited Yale,” Samson later reflected, grinning.


Throughout the Northern Pass controversy, Yale 
public affairs officers asserted that Wagner’s contract with 
Eversource had already been signed and that Wagner 
could not legally back out. Although the University refuses 
to speak in detail about its contract with Wagner, Yale’s 
argument appears something like: when the Investments 
Office enters into a contract with an investment manager, 
it sets general expectations and ethical guidelines for the 
manager but yields authority to interfere with day-to-
day operations. Yale did not have the power to terminate 
the Northern Pass lease nor would it have the power 
to change Wagner’s logging practices. Still, the Yale 
Investments Office’s website declares, “Yale will work 
with fund managers to implement its ethical investment 
policies” and can attempt “moral suasion.” When push 
comes to shove, Yale can sell its interest in a company to a 
secondary buyer. But that would cost money, not make it.


Ultimately, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of New 
Hampshire unanimously upheld a ruling that Eversource 
failed to demonstrate that the power line would not 
interfere with local land uses. The court’s ruling ended the 
Northern Pass project, but the fight has moved to Maine, 
where another power company, Central Maine Power, 
or CMP, hopes to route a similar transmission line from 
Quebec to Massachusetts. In late August, Wagner agreed 
to a deal with CMP to run the line across seventeen acres 
of Bayroot-owned land in Maine. The Bangor Daily News 
reported that Yale’s president Peter Salovey wrote in an

email to a concerned state representative that Yale has 
“no direct ownership of land in Maine,” but only “indirect 
property interests.” Salovey’s statement aligns with Yale’s 
curt defenses during the Northern Pass debate, but the 
fact remains that even an investor with “indirect property 
interests” has leverage. The issue is not that Yale lacks 
power; it is that the University doesn’t think that what is 
happening on its timberland constitutes a serious enough 
breach of ethics—or at least the University is not ready to 
reconsider how, or with whom, it invests in timber.


The Yale School of Forestry’s nearly 11,000 acres of 
New England timberland is entirely separate from the 
endowment’s. Frank Cervo, who manages the School’s 
woods, emphasized this fact several times to me, as did 
Professor Chad Oliver, who said there is a “firewall” 
between the Investments Office and the School of 
Forestry. Forestry professors and staff simply do not get 
involved in the management of the endowment. 


Curious about the “firewall,” I wrote to School of 
Forestry Dean Indy Burke. She replied,  “It’s not really 
a firewall, it’s just that we have our own forests” and to 
manage those “is about all we can possibly do.”  She said 
that the School of Forestry won’t criticize the endowment: 
“It’s rather like caring a great deal about your family but 
not getting involved or taking sides in your siblings’ marital 
issues just because you love and understand them.”  


Burke was nothing but gracious in her willingness 
to engage with me, and she even offered to meet with 
me in person, although not before my deadline for this 
piece. In her email, Burke rightfully pointed out that 
the implications of Wagner’s forestry management are 
complex. But Burke, as any Yale student or professor, has 
a stake in the endowment, and she, as the leader of one of 
the nation’s most prestigious forestry schools, has a unique 
position of power from which to weigh in on the ethics of 
timber management. 


Cervo graduated from the School of Forestry last year 
and has minimal knowledge about Wagner’s logging 
practices, but he cautions me about criticizing the 
company. He warns that some of the coverage he has 
seen about Wagner has lacked “basis” in forest ecology. In 
October 2018, Cervo took several Yale students on a tour 
of New Hampshire forestry, including Wagner-managed 
land. He called the company “gracious” hosts and said 
that nothing he observed seemed problematic. But, he 
admitted, “You’d need two to three weeks [on Wagner’s 
land] if you really wanted to diagnose what they’re doing.” 


I can’t conclude that Wagner is doing something 
categorically wrong. I don’t have the expertise to assert 
my own judgments about a company’s forestry practices, 
and I am not sure anyone who has the expertise as well 
as the means and time to assess Wagner’s operation 
comprehensively would speak to me on the record. I 
strongly suspect Wagner could be doing better. And I 
believe firmly that the Yale Investments Office should 
invest only with a company that practices exemplary 
forestry, even if doing so would generate less profit. But 
until we know exactly what Wagner is doing on Yale’s land 
and until the right people start looking into what Wagner 
is doing on Yale’s land, forming an accurate conclusion 
about whether or not Wagner practices “sustainable” 
forestry may be impossible.


Yale’s endowment covers more than a quarter of the 
University’s operating budget, including professorships 
and financial aid. And the Investments Office engages in 
secrecy no doubt to prevent competitors from discovering 
their investment strategies. Secrecy gives Yale a leg up. 
It helps Yale fund critical programs. It benefits all of us, 
students and faculty alike.


At the same time, secrecy prevents us, stakeholders, 
from holding the University to the high standards that 
it preaches. At an institution which prides itself in the 
pursuit of Lux et Veritas, which teaches its students to 
be curious, to ask questions, and to challenge boilerplate 
narratives, secrecy about the ethics of its investments is a 
violation of Yale’s own stated values.


“If the heat gets too hot in the kitchen,” Glenn Booma 
said, Yale will change how it invests in timber. “The 
heat’s just not hot enough yet because you’ve got to drive 
hundreds of miles from New Haven and twenty-five miles 
up a dirt road in order to look at this stuff.” I drove that 
distance, and I would encourage others to do the same. 
Only then will what happens beneath the forest canopy 
become clearer. And only then will we know if the kitchen 
will get too hot.
