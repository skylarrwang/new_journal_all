EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
On a Friday in October, I wandered 
into a parking lot on Crown Street, 
the roofs of the High Street fraternities 
peeking over the trees. I hoped I had found the 
drop point for Kiki Air. The day was sunny and 
cool.  Overhead, I heard a buzzing noise. Cat and 
Josh pointed up. On the phone, a pilot asked me 
if I was “in a position to receive the drop.” I said 
I was, and a blue cylinder fell from about sixty-
five feet in the air, bouncing against a curb about 
twenty-five feet away from me. I tore open the 
padded cerulean envelope. My Toblerone bar had 
arrived; the drone flew away, arching over a line of 
buildings until it vanished from view.


Yale undergraduates Jason Lu, Josh Ip, and Cat 
Orman hope this might be the future—lightweight 
snacks and sundries delivered by drone. That vision 
is driving Kiki Air, a drone delivery app for Yale 
students, developed by Lu and Ip. As Ip sees it, the 
coming years will almost inevitably include drones 
at our beck-and-call. 


Food delivery services like UberEats already exist 
in New Haven, and as Ip mentioned, the market 
for drone delivery is quickly becoming crowded. 
In 2016, Amazon announced “Prime Air,” a drone 
delivery service whose rollout has been continually 
delayed; Google, UPS and Walmart all have similar 
services in the works. But Ip clarified that Kiki 
Air is not competing in the meal-delivery or the 
package-delivery market, which are Amazon and 
Google’s terrain. Kiki Air’s small drone can only 
carry loads up to six-hundred grams. Rather, Kiki 
Air competes with delivery services like GoPuff, a 
self-described “convenience store delivery app and 
digital convenience retailer” available in dozens 
of U.S. cities, including New Haven, as of May. 
While Kiki Air’s prices are similar to GoPuff’s, 
its delivery time averages about five to six minutes, 
versus GoPuff’s half hour.  Kiki Air currently 
has no minimum price for an order, and no 
delivery fee. 


As Ip explained to me, each morning from 
Wednesday to Sunday, a student pilot picks up 
the drone from “where it lives,” in an apartment 
near Whitney Avenue. The pilot fills two suitcases 
with the day’s inventory—mostly snacks like candy 
or protein bars, but also other convenience store 
items like condoms, menstrual products, phone 
chargers, and toothpaste. The pilot sets up on the 
roof of a parking garage near the Grove Street Indian 
restaurant Sitar and prepares for any calls that come 
in, starting at 12 p.m. Nearby, another certified pilot 
goes to a ninth-floor office space that Kiki Air has 
rented, which the company calls air traffic control. 


The controller can see the drone from the ninth-floor 
window, complying with the “visual line of sight” 
required by FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) 
regulations. That controller also reports on weather 
conditions and generally monitors the airspace to 
watch out for airplanes and other flying objects. At 
dusk, generally around 6 p.m., the controller and 
the pilot pack up, having concluded operations for 
the day. 


FAA regulations generally do not allow drones to 
fly within five miles of an airport, but Kiki Air 
applied for and received a waiver from the FAA 
to conduct its operations near Tweed New Haven 
Airport. In transit, the drone flies a few hundred feet 
above the ground. When it reaches the drop site, it 
descends to about six stories off the ground, then 
releases the order on the pilot’s command.  Orman 
and Ip assured me that the mechanism for dropping 
packages is safe: packages are swathed in bubble 
wrap and cannot fall while the drone is moving. If 
the drone takes a sudden dip in altitude, a parachute 
releases to slow the machine’s fall.


Ip developed the Kiki Air app this past summer, 
and in the fall, he recruited Orman to work on 
marketing and publicity. Lu secured initial funding 
from an angel investor he met while interning at a 
venture capital firm. That investment covers the cost 
of the drone, training, certification, inventory, and 
wages for three to four FAA-certified drone pilots. 
Emerging drone technology is governed by just 
eleven pages of FAA regulations. The pilots at Kiki 
Air, mostly first-years in the Air Force Reserve Officer 
Training Corps program at Yale, have to train and 
take licensure exams at Tweed New Haven airport, 
per the FAA’s guidelines for remote-controlled 
drones. Ip remarked that certifying to be a drone 
pilot is “like going to the DMV.” 


Quinten Hoagland and Bryan Regan, two Kiki Air 
pilots who are first-year students at Yale, wrote over 
email that they took the job because of their interest 
in aviation. Hoagland remarked that the material 
covered by the FAA exam is largely tangential to 
the actual job of a Kiki Air pilot. Hoagland noted, 
“Aside from the ‘flying a drone’ part, the job’s very 
much like bagging groceries, except the bags are 
thick bubble wrap tightly secured around the items.” 
Orders typically begin coming in around 3 p.m. and 
continue until dusk. Kiki Air receives about twenty-
five orders each day. 


I was caught off guard by how Ip and the pilots 
brought the language of daily chores—going to the 
DMV, bagging groceries—to the hyper-futuristic 
experience of drone snack delivery. I wondered, 
briefly, if they had calibrated this language to ease the 
alarm in my mind, my suspicion of the unfamiliar. 
But their language was too casual, too off-the-cuff. 
Rather, it seems that the founders and employees of 
Kiki Air are entirely at ease with the robotic future 
that faces us.


Still, Hoagland remarks that he took the job with 
Kiki Air in part because piloting drones sounded 
“slightly bizarre.” As Kiki Air’s early success 
demonstrates, drone delivery may be commercially 
viable, but it retains a certain novelty. There is a 
chance that drones will fill the sky someday, and 
airdropped packages of chips and candy will be de 
rigeur for all-nighters. Indeed, Ip, Lu, and Orman 
are betting on it.
