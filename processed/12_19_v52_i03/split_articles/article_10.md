“¡N
ecesitamos ayuda!” pleaded one of the students 
as he tugged the collar of his white uniform 
polo shirt, exasperated because the digital Sasquatch 
on his screen wouldn’t move. “You just need to 
press here,” replied the young girl at his side, 
“See?” Although their teacher had been leading the 
coding lesson in Spanish, the two kindergarteners 
comfortably switched from one language to the 
other. These students, along with eight of their 
peers, huddled around a table inside their school’s 
new language development STEAM (Science, 
Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math) lab, 
the latest addition to a budding bilingual literacy 
project at Fair Haven School.


With fifty-three million people of Latin American 
descent, the United States boasts the second-largest 
population of Spanish speakers next to Mexico and is 
expected to be the largest Spanish-speaking country 
in the world by 2050. In places like New Haven’s Fair 
Haven neighborhood, whose population is over 60 
percent Hispanic, bilingualism is already the norm. 
As of last year, 46 percent of students in New Haven 
Public Schools have Latin American heritage, and 
eighteen percent are English Language Learners 
(ELL). Of those ELL students, 85 percent speak 
Spanish as their native language. Fair Haven School 
has the largest share of ELL students out of all schools 
in the city of New Haven.


Although the United States has no official language, 
English has been the traditional language of 
instruction in most classrooms across the country. 
Hispanic students, according to a 1997 report by the 
National Research Council, were once expected to 
“sink or swim” in a school environment that didn’t 
take their linguistic background into account. In 
February, the National Center for Education Statistics 
reported consistent underperformance in reading 
and math by Hispanic students when compared to 
their white counterparts in the past three decades. 
But dual-language programs, which are specifically 
designed to make education for ELL students more 
equitable, have been shown to increase academic 
achievement in these populations.


For the last four years, Fair Haven School—a 
district magnet school that largely serves residents of
