can’t legally circumvent. These types of contracts, 
called collective bargaining agreements, or CBAs, 
first originated in 1806, when skilled shoemakers in 
Philadelphia gathered together to demand higher 
wages, forming the first collective bargaining 
agreement, or CBA. Since then, labor unions in 
hundreds of other industries have joined their ranks 
to protect basic rights such as limited work hours, 
child labor laws, and healthcare. CBAs are essential 
for protecting workers, but they also have some 
drawbacks. Police labor unions, which originally 
formed in the nineteenth century to push for limited 
working hours, began negotiating strict CBAs with 
local municipal governments. These contracts 
must be signed by both parties, and voted upon by 
legislative councils for approval every eight years. 
According to ACLU activist Melvin Medina, 
Hamden’s police commission, which acts as a 
governing body for the police department, should 
have the power to investigate and discipline, and 
discharge officers. Yet the police commission lost 
these powers when it signed the CBA with Hamden’s 
police labor union. “The town willingly negotiated 
its rights away,” said Medina. “It’s actually the mayor 
and the legislative council that’s agreeing to this.”
Medina suggested that the town signed the CBA 
because it has set a precedent for decades of signing 
these agreements. Many legislative council members 
also may not be reading through the entire contract, 
Medina said—at least, that was the case in Hartford. 
If the legislative council members had actually 
received a full copy of the agreement, he believes they 
would push back on it. Various articles of Hamden’s 
agreement override the police commission’s power 
to discipline police. The contract requires that a 
written complaint be signed by the complainant and 
submitted within sixty days of an incident; otherwise, 
no disciplinary action can be taken. “This creates a 
system in which you time yourself out,” Medina said. 
The agreement also allows for gaps in police officers’ 
files—making it possible for recorded histories of a 
police officer’s actions to be incomplete. “How many 
complaints has [Eaton] gotten in the past?” Medina 
questioned. “We actually don’t know, since it’s not 
in his file.” 
In reality, according to two members of Hamden’s 
legislative council, the entire collective bargaining 
agreement has been shown to all members. When 
asked whether she’d read through the CBA, member 
Judy Clouse said, “Yes, I did. However, it was more of 
a, I need to sit with this understand it more, and not, 
I need to have it changed immediately. Now that I’ve 
been in for two years, I think there are changes that 
can be made.”
Clouse hesitated when asked about the plausibility 
of future negotiations to alter the CBA. “I hope there 
will be negotiations,” she said. 
Legislative council president Michael McGarry, 
on the other hand, was more explicit about the 
reality of CBAs undergoing any future change. 
“Negotiations are hard,” McGarry said. “It’s hard to 
get changes into the union contract. Not to say that 
it’s impossible.” 

In order to discipline Eaton, the Hamden police 
department must hold a hearing by December 
21,  sixty days after his felony charges were brought 
forth by the state on October 21. Activists worry that 
the city will take no action, and that Eaton’s pay 
will be reinstated in the new year, sustaining his 
employment and status as a police officer. However, 
Michael McGarry, president of the Hamden 
Legislative Council, claims that there is a reason 
for the CBA’s massive power: “to protect labor folks, 
so that towns can’t make some resolution that takes 
away workers’ rights,” McGarry said in an interview 
on WNHH Radio. According to McGarry the drawn-
out investigations into Eaton’s conduct are slow for a 
reason. “Everything seems to be working,” McGarry 
said. “It just takes a little longer. Part of the reason 
for that is that we need to make sure that everything 
is done as close to perfect as humanly possible. We 
want to make sure that there’s no automatic appeal 
to his termination.”	
Medina called McGarry’s argument “a red 
herring.”  He said that the CBA does not actually 
prevent the city of Hamden from organizing an 
independent investigation into Eaton before the 
state’s investigation concluded. Frustrated with the 
city’s lack of action, the ACLU filed a public records 
request, inquiring about a policy that keeps the city 
from conducting an independent investigation. 
Medina said the city “did not produce any documents 
backing this up.”
In Medina’s ideal world, the city of Hamden would 
instate an independent investigative body to deal 
with cases like Eaton’s. Completely unaffiliated with 
the police department and police commission, the 


agency would have the power to objectively analyze 
police misconduct cases. “We need more democratic 
control over policing,” Medina said. “In Hamden, 
you see a [police commission] that has the power to 
hold police accountable, but for legal reasons, are 
not able to.” 
When 
asked 
whether 
two 
simultaneous 
investigations into Eaton are allowed under Hamden 
policy, both Clouse and McGarry did not comment. 
However, McGarry offered, “I don’t blame the state 
attorney or anyone for trying to take all the time they 
can to make sure that it is done really well.”
Clouse, on the other hand, warned that “If there 
are two different investigations going on [at the 
same time], that can throw the whole thing off,” 
giving Eaton a chance to appeal. She wants to follow 
protocol as closely and slowly as possible. In the 
eyes of these council members, slow means careful. 
And careful is a means to construct a foolproof case 
against Eaton that won’t be appealed. 
Activists, however, still push to break down this 
bureaucratic system that essentially has its hands 
tied.


At the Hamden Memorial Town Hall, the 
microphone shut off at around 5:50 p.m. on 
November 13, but Roxana Walker-Canton, activist 
and Hamden resident, soldiered on. “My name is 
Roxie,” she said. Her voice was muffled, her back 
turned to the crowd as she stood at the podium at 
Hamden’s monthly police commission meeting on 
November 13. Walker-Canton and her pastel sweater 
struck a soft contrast to the gray-and-white garbed 
members of the Hamden Police Commission, seven 
of whom sat in a semi-circle before her.
One of the commissioners shook his head before 
leaning into his microphone. “I don’t think the 
microphone’s working,” he said in a matter-of-fact 
tone.
A woman, seated in the crowd behind the podium 
where Walker-Canton stood, whispered to her peers, 
“They don’t care if they can’t hear us anyway.”
After a few tweaks, the microphone revived. Walker-
Canton’s voice echoed against the olive-colored walls 
of the town hall.  The meeting resumed—the sixth 
since the shooting. And still, Washington’s shooting 
wasn’t written on the meeting agenda. The activists’ 
demands—to hold Eaton accountable through the 
justice system and to discharge him—seemed to 
have gone unheard. 
Six months after Eaton pulled the trigger, tensions 
between activists and police are rising. A series of 
steps toward consequences—the State’s decision to 
charge Eaton as a felon, Eaton’s recent not guilty 
plea, and the ticking of the clock as the December 21 
deadline for Hamden Police’s hearing—have given 
activists hope that perhaps this time, justice within 
the courtroom will be served. 
“My name is Roxie,” Walker-Canton repeated 
in a low, steady voice. “I am appalled at the lack 
of attention placed on this case. I am appalled that 
[Stephanie] hasn’t been put on the agenda until 
now. Their bodies were put in a situation where they 
could’ve been killed. The commission needs to see 
that this is important. It’s a public health issue when 
you talk about police brutality.”
The crowd exploded into snaps. Ellington, dressed 
in muted baby blue,  stood amongst a crowd of 
around one hundred protesters holding “JUSTICE 
FOR STEPHANIE AND PAUL” posters. 
“Talk about it,” Ellington yelled.
As Walker-Canton continued speaking into the 
microphone, her voice passionate, rising in volume, 
the seven commissioners stared straight ahead past 
her, expressions blank.
