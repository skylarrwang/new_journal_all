udge Patrick J. Clifford tapped the 
microphone in front of him. It was 10:53 a.m. 
on Tuesday, November 5, the windiest day of 
the week, but within the windowless courtroom on 
the sixth floor of the New Haven County Courthouse, 
the air was musty and warm. Clifford announced,  
“This is State v. Devin Eaton.”
Officer Eaton, dressed in a gray suit, his sideburns 
neatly trimmed, strode into the small courtroom 
with Win Smith III, his attorney. Smith declared 
Eaton’s not guilty plea. Within ten minutes, Judge 
Clifford recorded Hamden police officer Devin 
Eaton’s not guilty plea on the docket and announced 
his next court date, December 10. Just as quickly as 
he had entered, Eaton disappeared from the room. 
He didn’t say a word.
Last April, while on duty as a Hamden police 
officer, Eaton shot an unarmed woman, Stephanie 
Washington, 22, in the face. Despite increasing 
pressure from activists and the instatement of Eaton’s 
felony charges on October 21, he still retains his 
police badge and walks free, having paid $100,000 in 
bail on the day of his arrest.
Eaton was the first Connecticut officer to be 
charged for an on-duty shooting in fourteen years, 
according to the Yale Daily News. His felonies include 
one count of first-degree assault and two accounts 
of reckless endangerment. But Eaton’s movement 
through the judicial process, state investigation, and 
internal police investigation has been hindered by a 
collective bargaining agreement, or CBA, between 
Hamden’s Police Labor Union and the town’s police 
department. In the state of Connecticut, around a 
hundred municipalities have signed police CBAs, 
since the nineteen-sixties. These contracts originally 
guaranteed reasonable work hours, healthcare, 
and protected child labor, but they have also made 
it harder to hold police officers accountable for 
violations of the law. The Hamden Police Department 
is one of several departments across the nation that 
has struggled to fire an officer for misconduct due to 
the terms of a CBA.

The incident that has tested the limits of local 
police accountability systems occurred six months 
ago in a matter of minutes. At 4:20 a.m. on April 16, a 
clerk working the night shift at Go On gas station in 
Hamden called 911. The clerk told the operator that 
an African American male with dreadlocks, who was 
driving a red car with a female passenger, pulled a 
gun on a newspaper delivery employee to ask him for 
money. Earlier in the night, the clerk said, that same 
man had been “harassing” a different customer.
Hamden Police immediately sent officers Devin 
Eaton and Keron Bryce to Dixwell Avenue, where 
the two suspects had fled, according to the clerk. 
A dispatch went out to both New Haven Police 
and Yale Police, stating, “Just had a street robbery 
happen in our town, was heading in your direction 
on Dixwell Avenue, with a gun used in a street 
robbery,” according to the State’s Attorney Report.
Eaton and Yale officer Terrance Pollock drove 
separately onto Argyle Street, lined by four beige-
gray houses interspersed by vacant yards. Moments 
later, Paul Witherspoon arrived at the street in a red 
vehicle with Washington in the passenger seat. Just 
when Witherspoon emerged from the car with his 
hands rising into the air, Officer Eaton unholstered 
his handgun and fired in the direction of the car. 
Witherspoon ducked back into the car. 
Eaton says that in this moment, he feared for 
his life. “As he began to turn towards me, I saw 
the operator begin to raise his right arm up and it 
appeared that he was holding an object in his right 
hand, which appeared to be a gun,” he said in 
testimony included in the State’s Attorney Report.
As Witherspoon reentered the car, Eaton moved 
to the rear, still firing. He advanced to the other side 
of the car, where he shot Stephanie Washington in 
the face. In total, Eaton fired thirteen bullets before 
he fled down Argyle Street. Pollock, who fired three 
bullets, was grazed in the leg by one of Eaton’s.
Later in his testimony, Eaton claimed that he 
thought he was acting in self-defense. “I was afraid 
that the operator was going to shoot me and cause 
me serious bodily harm or death.” 
However, the Report’s account of Witherspoon’s 
testimony states that Witherspoon “never did 
anything to provoke the police to shoot at him. He 
was following the orders from the police officer.” 
When exiting his car, he pushed open the door with 
his left hand and stuck both arms out the door first to 
indicate that he had no weapon. Later investigations 
revealed that both Witherspoon and Washington 
were unarmed.
“[Eaton is] responding to what he believes is an 
attempted gun robbery,” Win Smith III, Officer 
Eaton’s attorney, told me on the phone, two days 
after the trial. “The man gets out of the car quickly. 
He can’t see his hands. He believes there’s a gun 
involved. He can’t see the person’s hand, and he 
fires.” 
Washington later recounted in the report that 
she was leaning back between the driver’s and 
passenger’s seat to duck for cover. “It was like being 
in a nightmare,” she said. “I thought I was going to 
die.” 
Both parties—Eaton and the two victims—claimed 
to have feared for their lives. Yet in the months that 
followed the shooting, members of the public have 
debated whether Eaton’s fears were justified. Eaton 
says he thought he was facing armed suspects in a 
robbery. But he, too, was armed—and as a police 
officer, he had the ability to call back-up.
The week after the shooting, New Haven’s 
streets flooded with protesters and signs; Wall 
Street was awash with a sea of passionate students 
and community members throughout the week, 
demanding the disarmament of Yale police officers 
and the discharge of Officer Eaton.
One of the New Haven activists, Kerry Ellington, 
believes that Eaton is a criminal, and should be 
treated as one. “What we witnessed was two officers 
jumping out of a car and playing video games that 
night,” Ellington said, speaking metaphorically. 
“There were children who were terrified that night. 
They heard the gunshots and ducked down.”
Ellington wants Eaton to be viewed by the court 
first as a citizen, then a police officer. “There needs 
to be immediate consequences,” Ellington said. “The 
fact that they’re being held to a different standard 
and the process for police officers is different than 
what any other human being would go through. It’s 
egregious. It shows that our system is compliant with 
police violence.”
But any immediate consequences for Eaton 
have been stalled by labor contracts that Hamden
