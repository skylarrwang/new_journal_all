the Fair Haven neighborhood—has been adapting 
to community needs by shifting its curriculum 
towards a dual-language immersion program. 
Under this model, students are taught all subjects 
in both English and Spanish, encouraging native 
speakers of both languages to become bicultural 
and biliterate. The program has grown to include 
one more grade each year since its inception and 
is currently offered for grades K-3. Along with its 
new STEAM lab, the dual-language program 
represents a break from traditional education for 
non-anglophone students.

Following a giddy group of children walking into 
school after a field trip, I sat down to talk with 
Heriberto Cordero, the enthusiastic and down-to-
earth principal of Fair Haven School, the largest 
elementary school in the district. Every once in 
a while, our conversation paused when students 
came into his office—where his doors were always 
open—or when he stepped out to greet someone’s 
grandmother. Cordero views his close relationship 
with students and their families as a point of pride.

Born and raised in New Haven, Cordero learned 
Spanish from his Puerto Rican family at home 
and only learned English once he started going to 
school. Cordero credits New Haven for much of 
his own education—the city’s New Haven Promise 
scholarship program gave him the opportunity 
to obtain a bachelor’s and master’s degree at 
Quinnipiac University on a full ride. In return, he 
wants to build up the community that so profoundly 
informed his own life. Cordero noticed that New 
Haven’s language programs needed dramatic 
improvement. “It’s something so simple, showing 
the students that we appreciate their language,” he 
said. “Growing up here, it wasn’t like that. The only 
valued language was English—you could forget the 
rest. Spanish, Arabic… nonsense!”

When Cordero began working at Fair Haven 
School five years ago, the ultimate goal of the 
ELL programs at the school had been to transition 
students to a monolingual, English classroom as 
quickly as possible. However, this emphasis on 
English acquisition risks the students’ losing their 
native language, which Cordero sees as a problem.

“Here at Fair Haven, we value all languages,” 
Cordero said. “Your language is not something 
I want to take away. It’s something we should 
nurture and support as a school.” Cordero’s dream is 
eventually to have an entirely bilingual school.

Such a dream was hardly imaginable to me when 
my parents, both immigrants from Peru, took me 
to my first day of school in a small Virginian town. 
Like Cordero, I was born in the United States but 
grew up only speaking Spanish at home. When I 
walked into the classroom, it was like stepping into 
an entirely different country. I didn’t learn to speak 
in a way my classmates could understand until about 
halfway through kindergarten, and, even then, I had 
difficulty managing the foreign sounds of English. 
My kindergarten teacher tried to teach herself some 
Spanish so that I could feel included in her classroom, 
but there was nothing remotely comparable to Fair 
Haven School’s dual-language immersion program, 
let alone a bilingual STEAM lab.

The language development STEAM lab is the first 
of its kind in the district, and its implementation 
has set Cordero’s dual-language program apart from 
the others in New Haven. As we spoke in his office, 
Cordero spotted Francisco Cajaraville Bonilla, the 
bilingual teacher from Spain in charge of the new 
STEAM lab, and invited him to join us. Our ensuing 
conversation flowed between English and Spanish, 
with tinges of Spanish, Puerto Rican, and Peruvian 
accents coloring our words.


Regardless of what language the students speak, 
Cajaraville argued, the lab—which functions as a 
weekly “specials” class alongside music, art, and 
“YOUR LANGUAGE IS 
NOT SOMETHING I 
WANT TO TAKE AWAY. 
IT’S SOMETHING WE 
SHOULD NURTURE 
AND SUPPORT AS 
A SCHOOL.”

physical education—allows them to use the 
abstract concepts they learn in math and language 
courses and apply them to something practical 
that they can visualize. Depending on the class’s 
dominant language, Cajaraville pushes students to 
learn the vocabulary for the technology they use 
in the less dominant tongue. If students are more 
comfortable with Spanish, for example, Cajaraville 
teaches them the terminology in English but 
provides definitions in Spanish.

Cajaraville decided it would be easier to show 
me how his classroom functions rather than to 
explain it, so he invited Principal Cordero and 
me to observe his Spanish-language kindergarten 
computer science class. Students were learning 
the fundamentals of coding through a tactile iPad 
game called Coding Awbie. In the game, players 
put together command blocks with buttons that 
guide a Sasquatch-like figure through a maze. As 
Cajaraville stepped over robot mazes and picked 
up 3D-printed action figures that former students 
had made, he pointed out how the children were 
working together, emphasizing his efforts to teach 
the students what he calls “transversal values” like 
collaboration, cooperation, and nonviolence to 
achieve their goals.

As Cajaraville showed showed me the lab’s 
equipment, a little girl with a ponytail trailed  
curiously behind her teacher, hoping he would 
make the small blue robot move again.

Technology, like the bilingual nature of the 
classroom, allows for individualization, Cajaraville 
said. “It allows each student to go at their own 
pace, and the teacher can make sure no one gets 
left behind without holding the more advanced
students back.” If students want to keep going, they 
can keep going. Two of the girls from his second-
grade class—who, according to Cajaraville, once 
started crying because the Internet was down 
and they couldn’t code—ended up writing over a 
thousand lines of code that year, more than doubling 
the other students’ averages. One seventh-grader 
who learned about music editing from Cajaraville 
two years ago now makes music mashups and posts 
them onto his YouTube channel, which currently 
has over one hundred thousand subscribers.

Although the class is officially bilingual, coding 
is another language taught at the school, and it’s one 
the teachers are still learning as well. Cajaraville 
uses the MIT-developed visual coding language 
Scratch with his students, but one of them, a boy 
named Juan, came in one day with questions about 
Python, a more advanced language. “I had no idea 
how to use Python,” said Cajaraville, “but I told 
him not to worry. We’re going to learn together.” 
In a STEAM lab like his, where the transmission 
of knowledge is no longer unilateral, the traditional 
concept of a teacher dissolves. Cajaraville argued 
that the “banking” model of education—in which 
the teacher has the knowledge and deposits 
it into the child—is no longer considered the 
most effective. “There are too many things the 
teacher doesn’t know, but if the students want 
to learn, we’ll either learn together, or they’ll 
teach me. Knowledge needs to be transmitted in 
every direction.”

Cajaraville now spends a lot of time in the local 
public library studying more advanced coding so 
he can help his students push their own intellectual 
boundaries. Cajaraville’s students are eager to 
learn—one even expressed wanting to program his 
own version of the video game Fortnite—and he’s 
willing to help them get there.

For Cordero, this language development 
STEAM lab proves something very important about 
the necessity of Fair Haven School’s dual-language 
immersion program; namely, that language is often 
one of the only barriers that prevent these kids from 
excelling in STEAM fields. “Five years ago, the kids 
here never had the opportunity” to learn computer 
science, especially in their own language, Cordero 
said. “Now I have a school of nine hundred students 
who are way more advanced than I am. I am so 
“IN A STEAM LAB LIKE HIS, 
WHERE THE TRANSMISSION 
OF KNOWLEDGE IS NO 
LONGER UNILATERAL, THE 
TRADITIONAL CONCEPT OF 
A TEACHER DISSOLVES.”

proud! It doesn’t matter if you don’t speak English, 
that doesn’t hold you back anymore.”

In Cordero’s and my own experience, starting 
school only knowing Spanish led many teachers to 
assume that the non-anglophone children were less 
intelligent or capable because they didn’t understand 
the material. In Fair Haven, however, students are 
working on advanced coding projects from a young 
age. The issue clearly wasn’t the material. It was the 
language. “In order to gain bilingual proficiency in 
a language, it takes about seven years of consistent 
work,” said Cordero. “Are you going to wait seven 
years to start teaching these children? Absolutely not. 
The learning has to continue, and that’s what we try 
to do here.”

While the burgeoning dual-language immersion 
program has brought positive change to the school, 
it is still in its formative stage. As more and more 
refugees and immigrants resettle in Fair Haven, 
the demand for educational resources in languages 
other than English and Spanish is also rising. During 
a parent-teacher conference, an Afghan family 
mentioned to Cordero that their children were 
coming home having forgotten some of their native 
Pashto—now the second-most spoken non-English 
language in Fair Haven, followed by Arabic—since 
they couldn’t practice it at school. When they asked 
Coredero  what could be done, he immediately 
talked to New Haven’s ELL Programs Director 
Pedro Mendía-Landa. “We’re now seeing about 
incorporating Pashto lessons for these students for 
about twenty minutes per day,” Cordero said.

Even with the dedication that administrators and 
teachers like Cordero and Cajaraville demonstrate 
to their students, maintaining a program like this is 
not an easy job. Finding teachers with the linguistic 
capabilities and the necessary certifications to 
teach in multilingual environments is difficult, but 
retaining them is even harder. “It’s a grueling job,” 
Cordero said. Bilingual teachers need to relay the 
same material twice, adapting it to two groups of 
students with different first languages. The New 
Haven Independent reported in November of last 
year that New Haven’s public school system has 
approximately fifty certified bilingual teachers for 
the more than 3,500 ELL students in the district. 
Hiring more and retaining the few they have is of the 
utmost importance.

Although 
there 
are 
similar 
dual-language 
immersion programs across the country, Cordero 
is confident that none has a language development 
STEAM lab as good as his. Once he realizes his plan 
to expand the program to every grade in the school, 
Cordero said, “Va a ser nítido”—it will be amazing—
“because it will be a program like no other.” With 
diligent and motivated educators like the ones at Fair 
Haven School, students may soon no longer have 
to dream—as I did—about attending an entirely 
bilingual school.
