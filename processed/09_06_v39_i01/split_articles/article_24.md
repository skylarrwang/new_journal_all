Bulldogs in Kabul 
"ANYONE 
WHO SAYS 
that disarmament is for 
the weak has never 
hauled 
old 
Soviet 
artillery down Afghan 
mountain roads." 


From a laptop in 
Afghanistan, Yale senior Whitney 
Haring-Smith describes the process 
of disarming an Afghan town nes-
tled deep in the Salang Mountains 
northwest of Kabul. The muni-
tions are left over from the 1979-89 
Soviet invasion, part of a 'five-met-
ric-ton stockpile being handed over 
by a local mujahideen commander. 


Haring-Smith is 
tagging along 
beside two technical ammunition 
experts, a representative from the 
Afghani Ministry of Defense, two 
large transport trucks, two pickups, 
ten Afghan police, and a group of 
laborers. The artillery has to be car-
ried down the mountain by hand 
before a donkey convoy could be 
assembled 
to 
transport 
the 
weapons out. 


Here, Haring-Smith finds that 
solutions to 21st century problen1s

are often holdovers from the 14th 
century: Donkeys remain the most 
convenient means of transporta-
• uon . 


The week-long disarmament 
project, 
which 
Haring-Smith 
describes as his "favorite field mis-
sion," is one of several he partici-
pated in this summer as an assistant 
to Afghanistan's New Beginnings 
Programme (ANBP), a branch of 
the United Nations De:velopment 
Programme. 


So how does an American stu-
dent from an Ivy League university 
come to spend his summer dispos-
ing of military ammunition in 
Afghanistan? 


During a 
~ore mainstream 
internship at the Pentagon the pre-
vious summer, Haring-Smith first 
made contact with . ANBP staff 
members. There was no formal 
application 
the "disbandment of 
illegal armed groups" isn't your 
typical summer internship 
but 
Whitney submitted a resume and 
got the job. He is the only college 
student, 
as 
well 
the only 
American, working with the pro-
gram. The majority of his cowork-
ers are former tnilitary profession-
UtJ modern and ancient modes of transportation are used in 
8 
als 
from other countries: 
an 
Albanian munitions expert, a for-
mer member of the Bangladeshi 
Special Forces, and soldiers from 
Kosovo, Germany, the United 
Kingdom. Every team member is 
clipped 
with 
a 
National 
Associate 
an Afghan who serves 
as a translator and link to the coun-
try's local and governmental net-
works. 


Haring-Smith is expected to 
coordinate missions like this one in 
Sarang 
Mountains, 
where 
·ANBP collects serviceable ammu-
nition and hands it over to the 
Afghan military. The group per-
forms work that is vital to the long-
term stability of Afghanistan; it 
destroys faulty ammunition that 
poses a safety hazard to the local 
population. 


Haring-Smith's involvement 
comes 
crucial 
time 
in 
Afghanistan's development. The 
transition to democracy has been 
difficult 
inefficiency and corrup-
tion 
have 
eroded 
confidence 
among both Afghans and interna-
tional donors. Anti-government 
forces, such as the Taliban in the 
'IHENEWJOURNAL 


south and east and Tajiks in the 
Panjshir Valley, · are fueling the 
growth of an internal arms trade 
and breeding widespread vio-
lence and instability. 


While roads are under con-
struction throughout the coun-
try, citizens still lack basic serv-
ices like electricity and running 
water. In major cities like Kabul, 
with a population of five to six 
million, police have rolled back 
proposed reforms and over-
looked human rights violations. 


As a result, dissatisfaction is 
growing among Afghans who 
blame the lack of progress on 
corrupt officials. 


''Afghanistan is a country try-
ing to make a leap from the 
fourteenth century to the twen-
ty-first century in only a few 
decades," writes Haring-Smith 
in an e-mail. He cites a local 
warlord who occupies a · cen-
turies-old role similar to that of 
the feudal lords of Medieval 
Europe. "Only now," Hating-
Smith says, "he's reachable by 
satellite phone." 


Overall, Hating-Smith sums 
up his experience in Afghanistan 
as "excellent." The Political 
Science major especially appre-
ciated 
how 
experience 
"made some of the costs of the 
Iraq war much more real." Such 
lessons aren't learned in a class-
room. 


''Afghanistan will get worse 
before it gets better," Hating-
Smith wrote in late August. 


"I remember once talking with 
a warlord 
there. 
He asked 
where I was going after I 
left Afghanistan. 
I told him 
that I was going to the United -
States, and he responded, 'take 
me with you."'
