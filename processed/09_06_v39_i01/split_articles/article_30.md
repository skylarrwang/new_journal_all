he prize for top speaker at the 
Princeton debate tournament is 
a bronze statue of ·a tiger. It is 
two feet long, posed in mid-growl 
or 
possibly mid-bite. Its shoulders are 
enlarged and the overall musculature is 
quite striking.· Weighing in at more than 15 
pounds, this is a tiger who has spent time 
at the gym. It seems more like a work of 
art than a trophy, but for a fmger-sized 
brass plate at its base ·that reads: "Top 
Speaker, Princeton, 2006." It is one of .the 
most coveted trophies for Yale debaters. 
Although .those who compete for these 
trophies aren't usually covered in campus 
publications, the Yale Debate Association 
has dominated the lives of its members 
for almost a century. Each week in debate 
tournaments at schools across the coun-
try, speakers pair off into teams, the teams 
debate, the best progress to playoffs, and 
one team is named winner. There are 
annual awards, weekly rankings, and con-
tinually updated statistics 
all funded 
through a private endowment. The YDA 
is one of the most elite, competitive 
groups on campus 
so why isn't it more 
reputed? 

Ariel Schneller, the most recent recipi-
ent of the tiger, has been a member of the 
YDA since his freshman year. A philoso-
phy major, Schneller's principal hobby 
other than debate is on1ioe poker, and it is 
not unusual for him to gamble with 
upwards of ten thousand dollars in a sin-
gle siu ing. The tiger, however, is worth 
almost as much to him as the thousands 
he gambles: Schneller keeps the bronze 
beast atop a bookshelf in his bedroom, 
where he sees it every day. "It brought me 
luck," he says. "I won at Stanford the next 
week." 

He is one of the less committed 
debaters on the Yale team, having attend-
ed only six . tournaments last year. Other 
members of the team's upper tier attend 
more than 15 tournaments anually and 
spend more than half their weekends 
debating at schools~ The weekly grind of 
tournaments 
sleeping on couches, driv-
ing several hours each way 
is what the 
debate team does. Most Yalies would

tors 
but it's much less obvious to high 
school debaters. "When you have a strong 
team, people tend to self-select," says 
Dean of Admissions Jeffrey Brezlin, "but 
I wouldn't say we privilege debaters, and 
we don't recruit them." 

Like every other student organization, 
the Yale Debate Association begins 
recruiting in September. Its intensive

cringe at the thought of losing even a few 
weekends to an extracurricular activity, 
but for committed debaters this is an 
entire social world, with its own lingo, 
parties, and marks of fame. 
ollege debate has undeniable 
appeal. 
Debate 
is 
popular 
among high schoolers eager to 
build up their resumes, confident that the 
experience will translate into an accept-
ance letter from their school of choice. 
The Yale Debate Association website 
earnestly protests that it does not have 
any sway with admissions officers, and 
states that the Association cannot recruit 
debaters before they are admitted. This 
seems obvious 
after all, The Yale Daify 
process, however, is more like that of the 
lacrosse team than the chess club. Last 
year, eighty freshmen tried out. Twelve 
made it. The two-day process is a cross 
between a play audition. and the LSATs, 
with performed an written portions. 
The lucky few who make it through 
tryouts often find the stress of competi-
tion equally challenging. There are special 
tournament awards for "novices" (debate 
lingo for freshmen), but the level of com-·· 
petition is much tougher than it was in 
high school, and inexperience hinders 
most from winning other prizes. u sua11y 
only a third of debaters persist after their 
first year. "The thing to remember," says 
Schneller, "is that you're having freshmen 
sacrifice formative weekends at Yale to
