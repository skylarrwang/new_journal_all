, ing to start son1ething new. YDS gave me 
the courage to go out and tty something 
risky."· Wooden is now in his tenth year as 
Head of Bosque School, which he has 
watched grow from 75 to five hundred 
students, praised for its focus on the 
moral development of its students. 

The Yale Divinity School has long 
pursued the task President Kingman 
Brewster assigned the University forty 
years ago: To train a generation of 
leaders. To lead 
be it in a moral or 
civic capacity, in a church or in a high 
school 
one must know what he or 
she believes and why. A Yale Divinity 
School education can provide one with 
this knowledge. 

prawled on the trim grass of 
the 
Sterling 
Divinity 
Quadrangle, one is saturated 
by a quiet that is hard to find on the 
central University campus. Here, the 
cahn mood suits the Georgian brick 
buildings, 
ubiquitous 
white 
columns, and the solid, square chapel 
at the end of the quad. 

''It's a splendid setting for a Divinity 
School 
education," 
says 
Linda 
Lorimer, Yale Vice President and 
Secretary. "I'm very pleased the 
University made the major investment 
to renovate." 

"It continues to be a gem," Wooden 
agrees. He speaks of a renovation . 
that not only precluded further 
asbestos leakage, but launched a pro-
gram of conceptual change. "It just 
seems to have a larger mission now." 

Now, the school prepares its stu-
dents not only for the academic · and 
religious environment, as it did in the 
19th and 20th centuries, but for the real 
world. 

As Anderson described; the 
Divinity School is finally catching up.
