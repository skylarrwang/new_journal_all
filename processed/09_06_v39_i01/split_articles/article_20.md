The Brine Arts 
ON A WARM, BREEZY 
day in August, four 
men have come to the 
farmers' 
market in 
' 
New York City's Union 
Square to ask Rick 
Field about pickled 
okra. "Okra," Field muses, '<well, she's like 
a woman." When it comes to the art of 
pi 
· 
he informs them, "you can take 
the measure of most vegetables easily, but 
okra is unpredictable." 

Field, who graduated from Yale in 
1985, is the rnan behind Rick's Picks, a line 
of artisanal pickles that he started in his 
New York City apartment nine years ago. 
Tall and tan, the former EngJish major 
bears little resemblance to the wizened 
picklers of yore. He is at once profession-
al and slighdy disheveled, a Lost Boy who, 
upon 1} 
he had grown up, turned to 
brine instead of the botde. Field consid-
ered himself only a recreational pickler, 
tinkering with his mother's recipes on 
weekends, until 2001, when he atteuded 
the Rosendale International Pickle Festival 
in Rosendale, New York The festival, 
whose official instrument is the piccolo, 
boasts a pickle toss, a pickle · · 
contest, and a gleefully cutthroat pickling 
contest. Field's wares won six ribbons, 
including Best in Show; in 2002, his pick-
les again took the top tide, and less than 
two years later, Rick's Picks officia11y incor-
porated His Brooklyn apar 11 nent could no 
longer accot •nnodate the burgeoning pick-
le t1 npire 
a few hundred gherkins are 
nobody's ideal roommates. So Field now 
produces his pickles in upstate New York, 
but runs his business from Chrystie Street 
on the Lower East Side of ~tt:ruano...-
once the heart of the city's pickle industry. 

On Wednesdays, he ventures uptown 
to the Union Square Greenrriarket, where 
he hawks his line of nine pickle varieties to 
passersby. Today, as he offers one visitor a 
sample of his pickled okra, Field warns 
that th~ vegetable is still in ''beta-testing." 
He hopes it will eventually join the official 
Rick's Picks roster, rounding his stable out 
to an even ten. 

If there is a pickl~ avant garde, Field 
is at its forefront: he takes a mischievous, 
experitnental attitude toward the process, 
and his okra will join a family whose mem-
bers include Phat Beetz 
whose brine 
includes rosemary and allspice, 
and Bee 
'n' Beez 
bread-and-butter style pickles 
sweetened with coconut, ginger, and dried 
cherries. 

Field participates in a storied tradition. 
The Egyptians employed a technique sim-
ilar to pi 
to preserve their dead, using 
the same word to denote both embaltn-
ment and the process by which they cured 
food. Etymologically, "pickle" derives 
from the Middle Dutch noun for the brine 
in which the food was preserved To speak 
of the pickle, then, is necessarily to speak 
of its creation, and its creators. Food 
-preservationists and their ilk have always 
been a colorful crowd--consider Wi11iarn 
Buck1and, the nineteenth-centm y Oxford 
professor who served his dinner guests the 
meat of a wooly manunoth, preserved in 
ice for thousands of years 
and Field is 
no exception. His college years coincided 
with the golden age of Yale's air guitar 
scene, when he and his friends performed 
as the Rolling Stones at Berkeley's annual 
contest, where their entourage included an 
"air roadie." Namra11y, Field was Mick 
Jagger, and his stand in Union Square is an 
encore to this illusory perforr nance. The 
man is 
ps a magician: if air guitar is a 
kind of sleight of hand, then pickling is 
akin to alchemy, as Field transforms the 
diffident cucumber into the jaunty pickle. 
The averred "critical 
· g skills" 
Field acquired at Yale are on full display as 
he tends to his pickles: No nuance is left 
unexplained, no potential pairing is left 
unmentioned, and no customer is left 
behind. He even assuages hesitant vegetar-
ians; one woinan recoils after he tells· her 
that the GT 1000s (a c_uirieq_tomato pick-
le) will go well with ~urgers, and refus-
es to pick up the jar again until ~e propos-
es she pair them with cheese instead. 

Presiding over his pickles at the 
Greenmarket, Field calls out, "How's 
everyone doing today? It's hard to aq~ue 
with today." He holds court until sun-
down, telling jokes about asparagus, 
singing a song about a co~ offering Rick's 
Picks stickers to children. To speak of 
Rick's pickles, then, is to speak of their 
creator.
