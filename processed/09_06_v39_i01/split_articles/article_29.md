er finger guides me first, then 
her voice. She points to a neb-
ulous white cloud, then traces 
the dotted patterns of light that spiral 
out from it. I follow her voice on this 
journey through young, old, pulsing, and 
dying stars until her finger comes to rest 
upon the darkness at the photograph's 
edge. ''This is a photographic plate of a 
supernova," she says in a tremulous 
. 
voice. Her gnarled hands circle around 
one another as she describes the phases 
of a star. "Like people, stars age and 
change," she says. They are born, glo~ 
and then fade; some wither away, 
some explode into new forma-

My guide, Dorrit Hoffleit, is a ninety-
nine-year old senior research astronomer 
emeritus at Yale, who specializes in the 
study of variable stars whose brightness 
fluctuates over time: ·seconds, minutes, 
months, even years. Once the fundamen-
tal nature of these stars is understood, 
theorists can investigate how and why 
they behave the way they do. To search 
for patterns, she uses photographic 
plates. · 
This, the study of stars' 
positions and motions, is 
termed '~stronometry." 
It brought her to Yale in 
19 56 and keeps her here 
today. Though she officially 
retired in 1975, Hoffleit has walked 
across the parking lot between her 
aparttnent and ·her office in the Gibbs 
Physics building almost every day for the 
past thirty-one years. During the past 
seven or eight decades, she has written 
over three hundred articles and con-
tinues 
to 
conduct 
research; 
''Working keeps me alive," she says. 
Because of a recent fall, she has not 
been to her office for a few months. 
Instead, she works in her cramped and 
cozy apartment. Piles of papers rise 
from the table tops, building in white 
waves around the sitting room. 

"Some piles need to go in the 
Yale archives," she says, ''but most 
should be thrown away." 
On top of one pile lies a 

lS 
thick, blue book: The Yale Catalogue of 
Bright Stars, by Dorrit Hoffleit, Ph.D. 
Now referred to as "The Bright Star 
Catalogue," it is one of the most widely 
consulted astronomy catalogues; a com-
pendium of the names, positions, paral-
laxes, luminosities, colors, and other 
characteristics of more than nine thou-
sand stars, all visible to the naked eye. 
Her other works, including Astronomy at 
Yale, 1701-1968, quietly line the book-
shelves in her sitting room. There is nei-
ther a computer nor a television in the 
aparttnent. Hoffleit listens to the news 
over a sma11 radio on her kitchen table. 
Most scientists can't work without a 
computer, but she explains that her pres-
ent work 
researching the history of 
astronomy and ''looking 
· 
up gener-
ally because somebody wants some-
thing" 
doesn't require one. Books and 
catalogues are all that she needs. 
Hoffleit leans on her bamboo cane, 
to get up for a few seconds, 
then walks slowly f~ a few steps to pick 
up a large photo album. 
One picture shows her as a serious 
twenty-one-year old in cap and gown at 
her college graduation. ''I wanted to con-
centrate in math and the fine arts," says·· 
Hoffleit, who earned a degree in mathe-
matics from Radcliffe College in 1928, 
''but [the Radcliffe administration] would 
not let me. I thought, 'better chance of 
survival in math than in the fine arts!"' 
Hoffleit still indulges her interest in the
