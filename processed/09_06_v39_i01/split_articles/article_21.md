Daryl Smith is using a

form glass tubing into a

fimnel for a research 
facility upstairs. The 
blazing gas-and-oxygen lamp which he uses 
to shape the glass _exceeds two thousand 
degrees. While he fires one end of the glass, 
the rest of the tubing is heated by a four-
barrel Bunsen burner flan•ing electric blue. 
Smith is Yale's only full-ritne scieutific 
glassblower, the Don of glassblowing at 
THE NEW JOURNAL 


Yale. 
He's been taking the heat since 
1986, when he entered the only school in 
the country that offers full-time instruc-
tion in scientific glassblowing Salem 
Community College in New Jersey. 

According to the American Scientific 
Glassblowers Society, Smith belongs to a 
rare breed: In some states, there is only 
one glassblower. 

At Yale, he teaches Chern 565L: 
Introduction to Scientific Glassblowing, a 
class in which Yale graduate students use 
small torches to create scientific and dec-
orative wares. For many students, it feels 
more like an apprenticeship than a lab. 
''The glass is very forgiving," says Fabiola 
Barrios-Landeros, a former student. "If 
you made a mistake you just melt it again 
and start over."

oratories. Smith also does glass work for 
institutions outside the University. ''What 
I like about [the work] is it takes a long 
time to get good at it," he reflects. 
"Complex stuff there's no way to . 
machine-make that," he says, pointing to 
a vacuum system that looks like a fun 
. 
house for a water droplet, more Chihuly 
than Curie. 

With expert technique, Smith blows, 
stretches, gathers, and thickens the glass 
tubing as it is held in place by a glassblow-
ing lave, which spins and supports the 
ends of the tubing, freeing up his hands 
to manipulate the torches, forceps, and 
other forming tools. '~lot of it is feel," 
he says matter-of-factly. A man used to 
· laboring with his hands, Smith performs 
the ambidextrous act of maneuvering the 
oxygen valve to raise the temperature 
of the flame and removing extra glass · 
now in a liquid state 
by wrapping its 
flow around a solid rod. ''You've got to 
read what's happening," he says as he 
peers at the flame through yellowed safe-
ty goggles. 

One hundred years ago, techniques like 
the one Smith now practices involved 
whale oil or lard and a wick attached to a 
pedal . through which air was pumped.

While today's tools are more high-tech, 
something still feels antiquated about the 
craft, which possesses a certain mom-
and-pop feel that most trades have lost. 

"Glass is an umbrella term for a num-
ber of different materials," Smith contin-
ues. ''There are fifty thousand different 
forms of glass." With understated move-
ments, he scores and cuts a quartz glass 
rod, fills a 400 mL beaker with water, and 
places the shortened quartz rod and a pre-
cut piece of Pyrex into the flame of a 
Bunsen burner. Within seconds, the Pyrex 
grows soft and liquidous, like the bullet-
vision CGI sequence of a Matrix movie. 
The quartz, on the other hand, is white 
hot, like a glow stick at a rave. With grade-
school charm, he has demonstrated how 
melting points differentiate diverse types 
of glass, and how glass flows together to 
become a single piece . 

On the prototype glassware pieces he 
designs, he places a white decal With his 
signature. It is glass couture: An original
