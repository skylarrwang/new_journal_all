emerging from the skeptical outlook 
of the 2oth century, and trying to 
maintain 
its liberal reputation while 
· shifting to accomnlodat9e a burgeon-
ing Christian Right. 


Today's Yale Divinity School spon-
sors new initiatives such as the Yale 
' 
. 
Center for Faith and Culture, which 
tackles the issue of religion in ·contem-
porary society. The Center hosts con-
ferences, lectures, and workshops that 
address faith in the workplace, moral 
. leadership, and reconciliation between 
· Christians and Muslims. 


Such programs contradict the orig-
inal dogtna of the Divinity School, 
which branched off from the College 
in 1822 and occupied the current loca-
tion of Calhoun College. 


ow the Divinity School that sits 
at 409 Prospect Street 
far 
from the center of campus 
is 
one of five non-denominational divinity 
schools associated with American uni-
versities. 
Harvard, 
Wak~ Forest, 
Vanderbilt, . and the University of 
Chicago are home to the other four. 
Yale and Harvard's divinity schools, the 
most well-known of the bunch, could 
not be more different: Harvard focuses 
on comparative and world religions, 
while Yale values the academic explo'-
. ration of Christian history and theology. 


Harvard and Yale both began as 
schools of Christian study. In the early 
19th century, Boston was hit full force 
by the Enlightemnent. Science, reason, 
and secularity reshaped the Hat vard 
Divinity 
School. 


Enlightenment ideals trickled down the 
American coast, their impact. was . far · 
less revolutionary once they reached 
smaller port towns like New Haven, 
Connecticut. Yale escaped the make-
over and clung to its traditional roots. 


In the 1970s, the two schools again 
parted ways. Harvard Divinity School 
underwent 
significant 
curriculum 
reform and developed into a center for 
the study of comparative and world 
religions. Yale Divinity School warded 
off the new trends and retained its 
Christian focus. 


!though many 21st century 
Yale undergraduates pass the 
school while jogging up· 
Prospect Street or hear of it in 
Religious Studies· seminars, the Div 
School is much less well-known than 
the Law, Business, and Medical 
Schools. Years after President Richard 
Levin assumed his current role, he told 
Harold Attridge, Dean of Yale Divinity 
School, that he barely knew the school 
existed ~t the start of his presidency. 


The separation between the College 
and the Divinity School began in 1963, 
when Yale established an undergradu-
ate Department of Religious Studies. 
Today, religion classes are split between 
the Div School and the Religious 
Studies Departtnent, and both under-
graduate and graduate students take 
classes at both schools. Each prograrn 
offers different degrees: Ph.D.'s are 
earned through the Religious Studies 
Depat unent, Masters through the Div 


The_se gaps, along with the dis- · . 
tance between. the two canipuse·s~ are 
symptoms of a larger issue: How. to 
· practice and study religion in. an aca-
demic world that is . increasingly 
uncomfortable with public displays 
of faith. 


efore 1993, Levin's unfamil-
iarity with the Divinity School 
was not unique. Its campus, 
hardly a source of pride for the 
University, 
did not grace 
many 
brochures. Yale's 
· 
-year deferred ' 
maintenance policy left the Divinity 
School in sharnmbles. Anschutz recalls 
sitting in class and watching asbestos . 
tiles fall from the ceiling. 


But it wasn't only the facilities t4at 
were suffering. The Divinity School's . 
adrnission rate was embarrassingly high 
by Yale standards, the result of a 
nationwide drop in applications follow-
ing the Vietnam War. Though graduate · 
schools of all sorts experienced a spike 
in draft-dodger applicants during the 
war, afterwards a burgeoning national 
skepticism towards an 
· g organ-
ized 
religion included 
contributed 
to a long dry spell for the Church. In 
1994, Levin, hoping to reverse such a 
trend in Yale's professional schools, 
ordered the Divinity School to conduct 
a self-study. 


This evaluation revealed the obvi-
o~s: The dilapidated buildings were in 
. dire need of renovation. ·Relocation 
closer to the rest of carnpus was dis-
cussed, and though the idea was never · · 
executed, yale's gesture signaled a vote 
of confidence in the Div School's 
potential. 


Forty-nine million dollars later, a 
freshly renovated Yale Divinity·School 
-
witnessed a drop in its admissions rate. 
It now admits forty percent of appli-
cants 
a low percentage compared to 
similar institutions, especially given the 
relatively small pool of applicants. 
According to Anschutz, that nntnber 
represents a "better and brighter" 
student body. 


he Divinity School's politics 
have never been old-fash-
ioned. ''It's [a] bastion of pro-
gressive Protestant liberalistn,'~ says 
Betsy Anderson, another graduate. ''It 
just takes a while for it to catch up with 
the rest of the University." This transi-
tion is in action right now, as evidenced 
by shifting student demographics. 


"The Div School is in process 
it has 
changed, it is changing;' she explains. 
September 2006 


When she first set foot on campus in 
1994, at the age of 46, she found her-
self joining an older, predotninantly 
white student body. By 2005, however, 
44 percent of students were tninorities; 
58 percent of students in 2003 were 
under 
. Today, Anschutz describes 
the average student as twenty-seven 
years old and "just sorting things out'--
we're a real combination of sorts." 


The diversification of the Divinity 
School's student body has allowed a 
new voice to emerge: that of conserva-
tive Christians. The growing right-wing 
Christian population in the U.S. has 
penetrated the liberal fortress of Yale 
School, 
and 
Maryetta 
Anschutz, a self-described "progressive 
liberal," couldn't be happier about it. 


''The conservatives at Yale have 
incredibly thoughtful, thought-out 
positions," she explains. ''You can't 
hate 'em." Fundamentalist, evangelical 
Christians are attracted .to Yale for the 
same reasons as their liberal classmates: 
They want to be challenged so .that 
they can argue with greater conviction. 


Despite their shifting demographics, 
one thing about Div School students 
remains the same: They want the foun-
dation of a Yale education. 


"Yale education" has special 
nieaning at Yale Divinity 
School. The School differen-
tiates itself from its peers by focusing 
its course of study not on real-world 
training but on a strong theological artd 
historical background. 


Anschutz unreservedly expresses 
her faith in this approach. "The focus 
on oppression, prejudice, all that stuff 
you find at Hat vard and other places;-
" (She lowers her voice.) ''It's a· lot of 
hocus-pocus." 


These 
days, 
she 
explains, a·nyone who enters the pro-
fessional Christian world desperately 
needs "academic clout." 


As its chapel indicates} the Yale Divity School has retained its Christian focus. 


Perhaps in an era of stadium-sized 
churches and televised sermons, it is ~ 
yearning for yellowed pages and layers 
of dust that draws young Christians to 
Yale Divinity's traditional Georgian 
quadrangle. But the academic orienta-
tion of Yale's Div School doesn't mean 
that its students enter the real world as 
naive bookworms. As with the Yale 
Law School, theory is privileged over 
practice with the vision ·of a thorough 
grounding in theory as the best prepa-
ration for informed practice. 


With this in mind, Div School stu-
dents are broadening their goals upon 
graduation. One growing trend among 
graduates is an interest in prirnary and 
secondary education. Anschutz iuune-
diately focused on this issue when she 
took up her post as associate dean in 
2004. One of her personal projects was 
to encourage Divinity School training 
for future heads of private elementary 
and secondary schools. And not just 
religious schools 
Anschutz feels that 
a background in theology and spiritual-
ity can be extremely valuable in a secu-
lar set I ing. 


So does Andrew Wooden, who 
enrolled at the Divinity School in 1993 
for precisely that reason. He came to. 
Yale from Choate Rosemary Hall, a 
Northeast boarding school, where he'd 
worked as an English teacher and then 
as the Director of Admissions. Almost 
forty when he enrolled, Wooden was 
not looking for a religious comrnunity. 
He planned to avoid the daily chapel 
services and other aspects of the 
school's Hspiritual formation" program 
and instead focused on his study of lit-
erature. Wooden hoped this plan would 
set hitn on a path to become a head of 
school somewhere in New England. 


Traditionally, a high percentage of 
headmasters held Divinity degrees, as 
schools saw the role of headmaster as 
sitnilar to the role of a head of a reli-
gious conununity. ''We care a lot about 
the moral and ethical development of 
people;' Wooden said. 


After six months, Wooden was 
drawn into the Div chool comrnunity. 
''It awakened my spiritual life," he said. 
''It's a perfect little gem." 


While writing a paper about the 
pueblo churches of New Mexico, · 
Wooden 
ran 
into 
a 
group 
of 
Albuquerque parents in the process of 
. founding a new college preparatory 
school Setting aside his initial goal of 
leading an established New England 
school, Wooden seized the opportunity.
