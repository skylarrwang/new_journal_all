EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Take a creepy sidetrip to Gillette Castle, once home to the rflicial actor-impersonator of Sherlock Holmes, Jack Gillette . 
one hundred years of built-on additions. 
You pull into the hotel- lot, squeeze 
between a Mercedes and a Lexus and 
avoid making eye contact with a teenage 
valet who peers out at the dark as he 
assists older women in silken evening 
gowns into the swank, historic dining 
room. 

You're starving and want to go inside, 
but you're not properly dressed: This 
world, this Paradise, was not meant for 
you. The light wafting from the scores of 
windows is amber, glowing with a 
warmth you'll never feeL 
You walk away from the Inn and 
ascend a series of terraces. Where do 
they lead? Go upward, cross a hedgerow 
and levels of terraced lawn. 

Did Patricia experience this? The wet 
grass grazing your ankles, the sight of the 
diners below, stuffing their faces with crab-
cakes and spit-sloppy cigars? Did she stop 
to see the simple beauty that exists between 
September 2006 
places, at the center of everything? 
What the book gets wrong, you think, 
is that just knowing you are going to die 
makes everything beautiful, and every-
thing meaningless. To travel propelled by 
the dateline of an impending death is to 
travel without really seeing. If the same 
book was called 1000 Things to See it 
would never have sold so well 
the title 
appeals to an illogical and morbid fear, to 
our vision of the world as a check list 
where beauty can be a feat seen and 
accomplished. 

At the top of these terraces, you cross 
a hedge and find yourself trapped inside 
. a puzzle 
a curving maze of · garden 
hedges in concentric circles 
the sort of 
labyrinth pilgrims would walk in medieval 
churches. 
You look at your watch and it's ten 
p.m. Your stomach growls 
a sure sign 
you're still alive. You get back on the road 
and look for a restaurant. Is there a 
Friendly's? McDonald's? No, the fttst 
place you see is John's, a classy place with 
a purple placard sporting scarlet berries. 
You're much happier to arrive at this cafe 
than you were to see any of the four 
places in Schultz's book. A waitress seats 
you and offe~s liqueur and a pasta platter . 

Around you, older couples lounge in 
leather seats, enjoying their late-night 
suppers, cackling like fat Roman emper-
ors. This is hell, you think, biting the head 
of a jumbo-shrimp marinated in a bal-
samic reduction, and you are loving it. 
On the drive back you pass a tomb-
stone store, and consider stopping to 
place an order. Since surely, now, you've 
seen all there is to see.

College, is Editor-in-Chief of TN]. Jon Hood

Tonya A (Tutor): Welcome to Tutor.com. Do you 
have a homework question I can help you with? 

Me: I gots to write a story, but I'm not sure how to 
start? 
You know that you've reached your low point when 
you get your kicks by posing online as a desperate high 
schooler. Some titne last year, I reached my low point. 
Tonya A (Tutor): What must your story be about? 
Me: It has to be about my most favorite thing in the 
world. 


Although I first visited Tutor.com on a lark," I was 
hooked on the site's Live Homework Help from . the 
moment I logged on. Tonya A · and her colleagues were 
willing to help me with any problem I co~d imagine, 
and I took a perverse pleasure in inventing homework 
assignments to challenge them. 

Tonya A (Tutor): Have you decided what your 
favorite thing in the world is? 
Me: I think it would have to be my puppy ... I guess I 
should start with what he looks like?

Tonya A (Tutor): That sounds great! Yes, let your 
reader know what it is and then what he looks like.

. On occasion, a tutor would offer a good piece of 
writing advice. Let me tell you what Tutor.com is and 
what it looks like. 
First, what it looks like. Just showing it might be 
simplest: 


Now, what it is. Tutor. com is a library initiative 
to help New Haven students with school. Earlier this 
year, the New Haven Free Public Library introduced 
the Live Homework Help ™ system to assist citywide 
students fourth grade through college by providing 
"expert tutors." The site employs over one thousand 
tutors across the United States and Canada, inlcud-
ing certified teachers, university professors, graduate 
and undergraduate students, and professionals 
regarded as experts in their fields. The tutors con-
duct live, one-on-one online help sessions, assisting 
students with homework in math, the sciences, social 
studies and English. 
First introduced in 2000, Tutor.com is now acces-
sible from 1500 public library sites across the United 
States and Canada. The program's intention is to 
offer all children 
regardless of their economic 
background, geography, and scholastic ability 
the 
homework help they need through their local library. 
It is a laudable policy: The site doesn't even discrim-
inate against a high-achieving Ivy League student liv-
ing comfortably in the Gothic cradle of Yale. 


Tutor.com has received a favorable response from 
its users: "It's better than a real ~lassroom 'cause you 
are not afraid to ask them questions!" says one tenth 
grade student. "It's awesome!" seconds a fourth 
grader. Over 9 5 °/o 
of students who have used Tutor.com report that 
they're pleased. 
I am among that happy 95°/o. Not only have 
tutors helped me with my times tables, they have also 
brightened many sleepless nights that I might other-
wise have spent watchtng reruns o f "Cheers. 
Tutor.com is indeed awesome. 
It didn't take long for me to become a dedicated dis-
ciple 
every evening I would double-click my way into a 
new persona. I battled with ever 
g from split infini-
tives to long division (which is a lot more confusing than 
it was in fourth grade). The trouble came when I 
attempted to ask my first science question. Up until then 
I had stuck to what I knew: simple questions about essay 
writing and elementary mathematics. Then one night I 
decided to ask a question about science. 

Jeremy B (Tutor): Welcome to Tutor.com. How can 
I help you? 

Me: Hi there, I just wanted to ask for a little clarifica-
tion on stem cells and their uses in the medical field. 
I thought this was a vaguely intelligent sounding ques-
tton. 

Jeremy B (Tutor): Ok, what can you tell me about 
them? That will give me a better idea of what to , 
talk abut. 
I proceeded to give a confused description of stem 
cells as I understood them. I wished desperately that my 
Tutor would step in and give me an answer. 
Jeremy B (Tutor): That was fine: 
Jeremy B (Tutor): So you have just gone over the 
basics of them? 

Me: Yup! Maybe I should wait until my profes- .. 
sor has gone over it in depth and I'll read up on , 
it on the net. I'm sure there are millions of web- : 
sites all over the place - any recommendations? : 
- Jeremy B (Tutor): You are in a college class? 
Oh for goodness sake! What was this 
twenty 
questions? At this point I was getting seriously 
annoyed. 
Me: urn ... no. . . I am a high school student sit-
ting in on a college class! I need help! I need 
Tutor.com! I gots to write a story but I'm not 
sure how to end it! 
My disguise was lifted 
~ had been found out. 
I never did log back on to Tutor.com. These 
days, I find myself lonely on Friday nights, staring 
at the luminous computer screen with the grinning 
yellow icon looking back at me, wanting desperate-. 
ly to click the 'Connect' button that would lead me 
to the online classroom 
to my old tutors, my old 
friends, where everybody knows my name. 
Here I am, a sophomore at Yale College, and 
I've just been expelled from high school.
