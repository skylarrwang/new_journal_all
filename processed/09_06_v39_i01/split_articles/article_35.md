-Weather forecast for Jefferson, Iowa, 
June 21, 2006 
We wake at 5:30 -a.m., and by 7:30-
after rolling up ThermaRests, filling water 
. bottles, pumping tires, and stuffing Clif 
bars into our back pockets 
we ease back 
onto our bicycles and head off. Most days, 
courtesy of Brandon's nifty Blackberry, 
we know the daily high temperature, 
chance of precipitation, wind speed and 
direction. But not today. While Jefferson, 
Iowa has a bell tower, a shiny new Rec 
·center, and a public library that 
lends out both romance 
novels and cake 
pans, the 
town _ does not have cell phone service. 

Not until two miles out is there enough 
service to download the weather forecast, 
but by then we are. spread out over a long 
stretch of road, well on our way. 

Lina and I hive cycled about seven 
miles, chatting about poems and past 
crushes and favorite restaurants, when we 
both look ahead and fall silent. The sky is 
dark grey, but the other colors 
the green 
of the fields and the black of the 
asphalt 
are eerily bright. Directly ahead, 
a halo of white light surrounds a small, 
grey shack 
the only building in sight. 

On our right, a cluster of clouds seems to 
drip · right down to the ground. "That's 
rain," I say. We continue pedaling, 
approaching the line where the cloud 
stops melting 
the beginning of the 
storm. 

''What should we do?" Lina 
asks. 
There is nothing 
to do. 
We are the 
only ones in the 
uruverse: 
no 
riders to be 
seen, 
cars, 
buildings, no 
trees, no hills. 
There is noth-
ing but flat, end-
less field in every 
direction; the only 
sign of human life is 
the artificial straight-
ness_of the rows of crops. 
We keep on biking, the lines of 
• • 
our tires tracing from New Haven to 
Portland, across the United States as rid-
ers on the annual Habitat for Humanity 
Bicycle Chillenge. 

Over nine weeks and four thousand 
miles we traveled through farms and small 
towns from Pennsylvania to Iowa, biking 
each day and staying in churches and 
community centers each night. Each of 
the ninety Yale students on this year's .trip 
has raised money, relying on sponsorship 
from churches, fraternities, and next-door 
neighbors. Now in its twelfth year, the 
Challege 
generated 
approximately 
$420,000 this summer toward housing for 
low-income families. 

On the road, we ride another mile 
before I feel the fttst drop. "Lina!" We 
look at each other. "Sophia!" But even as 
she yells my name I lose sight of her. I 
scream as the rain pummels down on us 
and I have to duck rny head almost 
between my legs. I try to keep my eyes 
open through the waterfall pouring over 
my face. "SHOULD WE STOP?" Lina 
screams . 

"NO!" I yell; I feel infused, almost 
high with purpose: MUST KEEP BIK-
ING. Thunder crash.es above us. 

A few hundred feet farther along the 
road we find shelter in a barn. Others, we 
find out later, have escaped into a tractor 
garage, hidden under a front porch, and 
in the worst case, huddled in a ditch, · 
holding their bikes above their heads 
until a passing pick-up truck rescued 
them. Half-an-hour later we are back on 
our bikes, trying to remember all the 
words to Paula Abdul's ccStraight Up,". the 
water spinning off our wheels the only

43. Moran Junction, WY to 
t Yellowstone, MT. 88.7 tni1es. 
We sit on the benches circling Old 
Faithful, waiting for .the show. Japanese 
tourists toting fanny packs, fathers 
peering through heavy binoculars, 
mothers wearing pink visors and little 
girls sucking on melting popsicles all 
mill around the RV-packed parking lot, 
the gift shop, the restaurant, the hotel, 
the bathrooms, constantly checking 
their watches. According to the large 
clock at the entrance, Hie' will happen 
at 2:47 p.m .. 

"What makes this one special?'' a 
little boy asks his father. Good ques-
. tion. "Ies extremely predictable,'' the 
father answers, as the first spurts of 
steaming water shoot up. Watching the 
reactions of my fellow riders, I marvel 
at the irony. 

We biked over ninety 
miles to see this: the opposite of pre-
dictable. The crowd begins to ooh 
and ahh. 

Day 
7. 
Wellsboro, 
PA 
to 
S.tnethport, PA. 69.5 tniles. 

I've gone twelve miles and just gotten 
my third flat tire of the trip. On the rear 
· "Y~eel, I find a big gash. I'm alone and 
riding "sweep," the designated last rider, 
so there is no one behind me. I need a 
new tire. I need the van. I need to call the 
van. 

I 
need 
cell 
phone 
service. 
I. need help. 

''You need help?" yells an older man 
• wearing a camouflage baseball hat out the 
. window of a slowing SUV I ask him if 
he has cell phone service and he laughs, 
then adds, "There's an inn down the 
road, they got a public phone there. I can 
give ya a ride 
just pop yer bike in the 
back." 

I pause for a motnent, then get in. 

''Yer not one of them 'Habitat for 
Humanity' folks, are ya?" he says as I 
buckle my seatbelt. It sounds like he's 
asking me if I have the plague. I tell him 
I am, and he lets out a loud guffaw. ''You 
·. tellin' me I let one of them damn liberals 
in my car?" he yells, in what I hope is 
jovial disbelief. I stammer something 
about Habitat being a Christian organiza-
tion and he cuts me off. "I just don't 

believe in givin' people like that stuff for 
free." I consider telling him Habitat isdt 
a handout, but decide on an enthusiastic 
nod instead . 

"I work!" he continues, "I work my 
whole life. How come they get to just sit 
on their ass and we're gonna give 'em a 
house!" He looks over at me. 

''Yeah," I say, trying to look as con-
vinced as possible. He seems satisfied. 

''They always gonna be trash." He 
checks the rearview mirror. ''You know, 
it's like my daddy used to say: 'trash 
begets trash."' 

There are broad vistas of the road, the 
cozy church basement~ we sleep in every 
night, and there is this 
the America we 
came to see, devoid of postcard beauty . 
The Pennsylvania wilderness rolls by, and 
we ride in silence the rest of the way to 
the inn, my bike in the back. 

Day 45. West Yellowstone, MT to 
Virginia City, MT. 78.2 tniles. 

'~e you serious? I'd put that thing on 
in a second," Schecter says and we laugh 
as we discuss the possibility of a wearable 
happiness machine. The five of us are 
flying; the road is flat, there is a tailwind, 
and, although I am barely pedaling, my 
odometer reads 23 miles per hour. "'This 
helmet is going to permanently maximize 
my happiness? Who wouldn't put it on?'' 
he continues, siu ing up straight and ped-
aling with his hands by his side. 

Deirdre glances over her shoulder at 
Schecter. "But it's not real. Really you're 
just sitting in a chair with electrodes 
attached to you." 

'~nd how about other people?" I say, 
swerving away from some road kill. 
"Like, you meet the absolute love of your 
life, and you're happy because you believe 
there really exists out there someone you 
connect with that deeply, but actually 

"No, I'm happy because my wife is 
hot." 

Schecter giggles, and Deirdre 
shakes her head in disgust. ''You are 
ridiculous," she says, speeding up to 
Adam and Colin. 

Whatever Schecter says, we don't want 
some hypothetical helmet that sits us 
still 
we want a bike helmet and the wind 
at our backs. We all want to see things.-
the golden and the gritty. We want to see 
• .LU.,g. 

I look out at the mountains. I am 
starving. I look down at my odometer; 
we've gone 43.2 miles. 

It's almost 
lunchtime. Deirdre and Colin are talking, 
but I can't hear them, and Schecter has 
fallen silent, so I start to scan the horizon 
for the turquoise trailer, praying that 
there wi11 still be lunchmeat by the time 
we get there.
