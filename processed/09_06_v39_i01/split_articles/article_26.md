manner. All students agree on only 
one thing about the program: that 
it is very vaguely defined. 

Not surprisingly, the University 
is in the process of re-evaluating 
the program's perceived inconsis-
tencies and redefining its purpose. 
In August 2005, Dean George 
Levesque assumed the title of 
Dean of Freshman Affairs, a 
newly-created 
position 
that 
requires him to review many of the 
College's 
freshman 
programs. 
Though he has spent a great deal of 
time 
evaluating 
Ethnic 
Counselors Program, he has yet to 
address the concerns of those who

The University's ambiguous 
description is ·unlikely to help him. 
One University website attempts to 
spell out the program's purpose: 
"Although the problems of all incoming 
freshmen are in most respects similar, 
those of minority students can nonethe-
less be different if various acculturation 
pressures accomparry their ac!Justment at 
Yale. Such a rystem of counseling pro-
vides minority freshmen with · a gr~up of 
counselors JJ!ho have coped successjui!J 
with similar difftcultif!S." · 

But the literature does not artic-
ulate any of the ''similar 'difficul-
·"· ' 
ties" successfully coped · with by 
minorities. The description is delib-
erately vague; it makes no specific 
comment on the experience of 
minorities at Yale. It intends to 
expand, rather than narrow, the 
counselor's responsibilities. In the 
process, it fails to . justify the need 
for 
program. 
Levesque 
acknowledges this problem and 
believes the University should 
reconsider how it presents the pro-
gram to its students. "We have 
often put our ethnic counselors in 
a very ambiguous and difficult 
position," he says, "and I think we 
as an institution need to do [a] bet-
ter job of defining and describing 
the program." 

If Yale administrators have 
trouble articulating the role of the . 
Ethnic Counselor Program, it's 
easy to understand how a freshman 
might fail to grasp its purpose. 
Mona Elsayed, now a Junior in 
Jonathan 
Edwards 
College, 
checked the box marked "Other" 
when her Yale application asked 
her to select the ethnicity she

strongly. 

She does not remember explic-
itly mentioning her Egyptian back-
ground anywhere on her applica-
tion and was surprised to learn that 
she'd been assigned an Ethnic 
Counselor. 

"I was impressed that so much 
investigation had been done to dis-
cover I was not white," she wryly 
notes. "Nobody really explained to 
me what the point of it is." 

Elsayed is a first-generation 
American with two Egyptian par-
ents, but her heritage did not great-
ly influence her upbringing. she 
checked "Other" because it best 
described her ethnicity, not because 
she considered her Egyptian her-
itage particularly relevant to her 
identity. She didn't go so far as to 
fill in the line next to the box that 
asked her to specify her ethnic 
group; "Other" suited her fine. 

Jade Pagkas-Bather, who served 
as an Ethnic Counselor last year, 
felt differently when she marked 
the box on her application. She is 
part Jamaican, part Greek, and, 
unlike Elsayed, sees her race as a 
defining aspect of her identity. On 
the Facebook.com, ~agkas-Bather 
is a member of groups such as 
"First Generation-ers," ''SMHAC: 
Students of Mixed Heritage and 
Culture,'' and "The Mulatto Army." 

When Yale asked her to identify 
with a specific ethnic group, the 
box she checked meant something 
to her. She had positive experiences 
with her residential and ethnic 
counselors as a freshman, motivat-
