.
ay you're about to die, and
you're in Connecticut. You
basically have two options:
First: You book a plane
ticket to Aruba, empty your bank
account on a cheap prostitute and an
expensive bottle of rum, pen a verbose
will, shack up in a cabana, and let death
take its course.

Second: Let's be serious. You look at
the cold, rain-soaked street and realize:
I live in Connecticut. I don't do places
like Aruba. I don't do sun. So you do
what you do every day. You walk into
the corner bookshop and think, 'these
are all the books I will die without reading.' You silently accept that fact and
grab a neatly-packaged guide to your
last days: 1000 Places to See Before You Die.
The author of this 894-page tome is
Patricia Schultz, a former Conde Nast
travel writer who, judging by the youthful
headshot on the dust jacket, has not
lived long enough to have ventured to
all one thousand sites. The resulting
compilation reads less like a handy travel
guide than a coffee-table book, featuring cute descriptions of teahouses
and temples. Of the 184 pages devoted
to the United States, four are dedicated
to Connecticut. And since you have a
day to live
maybe less, as the doctor · ·
was a little vague
it offers a handy
itinerary for your last hours on Earth .
Turn to page 592. Your first stop is
Essex, which Schultz calls "a mint-condition one-traffic-light river town where
the dignified revolutionary-era spirit
still lingers.''


Essexs historic Griswold Inn boasts (The Gun Room," where todqy thry serve breakfast if you can keep it down.
What's lingering today are the clouds.
At a gray 9:30 a.m., you're tumbling down
a road toward a sleepy shoreline town in
Southern Connecticut. Essex boasts the
Griswold Inn, otherwise known as "the
Griz," where
along with every other
historical site in the Northeast
George
Washington once shared
a drink with pals. That -
sounds good, but it's 10
a.m.
Breakfast?
Let's
look in the book ...
"Guests come for the
table-groaning
buffet
(the inn's sausage is
made from a historical
recipe)." You approach
the bored blonde who
staffs the Inn's front
entrance. She gives you a
once-over and, as if
death is etched on your
e
face, coldly replies that the Griz "~oes
not serve breakfast to non-guests."
You accept visual nourishment instead,
idly wandering among the Currier & Ives
prints that Schultz praises. What you find
is The Gun Room, where a veritable
smorgasbord of pistols, muskets, and big
old clunkers of guns deck the walls. Way
September 2006
to drill in the mortality issue, Schultz.
Guests loll in the foyer, waiting in
limbo. Is there a tour bus coming? A toy-
ship-building convention that starts up in
an hour? You leave and walk down thin,
angling roads toward the dockyard,
where boats slowly rust and men in rain-
coats yell at the gray sky. Despite the
storm, there's one place still serving coffee
The Craw's
Nest.
The
Nest is just a step below heaven,
its
butter-yellow
kitchen
offering
Mexican omelettes on plastic plates. On
the deck sits a priest, staring out past an
overweight family

townsmen mill about
in the mist with vacant looks on their
-
faces, their mouths agape like zombies.
You flee, crossing the river on a white
bridge, and twist up the sinister cartoon
hill. There you find a dark castle, not
unlike Count Chocula's, a cairn of rough-

hewn, rain-soaked stones.
It looks like the watchtower of Hell.
You leave, quickly, letting the car glide
down the hill. The hours are ticking by ...
Death waits for no man, and neither
will your second stop: Mystic Seaport, "a
recreated coastal village that brings salty
19th century maritime America to life."
Life!
• . It's really raining now. Water sweeps
across the roads, funneling down to
· Mystic Seaport, the town you know best
as the backdrop for "Mystic Pizza." At
death's door, you can't believe you ever
wasted precious hours watching a young
Julia Roberts sprinkle parmesan and peppercorns.

You're becoming skeptical of Schultz's
judgment. Sure, Essex was beautiful, but
by classifying it as something necessary
to see before dying, Schultz defines what
is necessary to accomplish in life. Can we
not live out our lives in our own back-
yards, cultivating our own gardens?
Who's to say it's more necessary to see a
' quaint tourist town than a Julia Roberts
movie that runs on TBS?
Like Essex, Mystic appears to be just
another tiny town near another big body
of water. More boats with big, tipsy
masts scoot around a harbor, flanked by
mz
narrow roads

more specialty shops selling tea-cozies
and ships-in-bottles. It feels like an imitation of a historic town that never existed.
Whaling
the town's ancient industry-
was a messy business, but Mystic's current
wares smell of cinnamon and all-
spice. The drawbridge that once lifted for
big, muddy boats has become a show.
"Oh, look," a woman gasps, grabbing her
husband's arm, 'We almost missed seeing
the bridge!"
·
The other big draw is a maritime
museum that boasts what Schultz calls
36
"one of the world's largest beluga whale
exhibits." Here, you're in the belly of the
beast. Tourists cram the museum's walkways, hallways, and parking lot. So the
car's parallel-parked in front of Mystic's
drawbridge, providing a front-row seat
for a show too boring to watch. Someone
has parked illegally behind you and, by
God, you're on a hill, driving a stick, and
you're trapped. You put the car in neutral,
pump the clutch, and use the parking
brake for all it's worth. While you struggle, a dog on the street guards the glut-
tons feasting inside Mystic's historic ice
cream shop. He's a mean, growly thing,
and he snaps at you.
It's time to get the hell_out of Mystic.
_ You would go around the world to
escape such a dull town, so you consult
your guide. Why, lookee here, Schultz
says that "literary fans come from around
the world to visit the home of one of
America's most famous and beloved
authors"
Mark Twain. His house is in
downtown Hartford, and at five p.m.-
it's already that late
the traffic is as slow
as . honey dripping down the back of a
spoon. The road leading into the city is
balanced on columns and the city below
looks like a network of ditches.
You descend into the urban tangle
vacant
ezr mouths
and find a network of brown signs pointing
toward the house. Like Hansel and
Gretel, you follow the crumbs to the
doorstep, where a broad-shouldered
giantess of a woman emerges from a
door nestled in the gentle slope that is
Marky's lawn.
'We're closed," she shouts, waddling
to her waiting chariot.
Your watch confirms this: It's past .
five. But the house still stands
a glorious, red-brick Victorian with windows
that reflect a sky as white as bone.
You wait for her to pass, climb down
a ditch, and relieve yourself in the bushes (the road to Hartford was a lesson in
patience for your bladder). You pass the
gift-shop, where a glass window showcases stiff porcelain dolls, faces upturned
like those of children frozen in a lake.
They stare back, as if you are a traitor for
being here at all. "Don't you," they seem
to ask, "have somewhere you should be?"
Your guide told you to be here, however, so you stand on tiptoes, peering into
the house's windows like Tom Sawyer
watching his own funeral from the attic.
You feel as if you are seeing the rooms as
they should be seen, not paraded about by
an authoritative tour guide, but peeked at
by a deceitful child.
You walk back up the ragged hill, with
grass long and overgrown like Lucifer's
matted fur. You pass through the center of
the parking lot, where the car glimmers
faintly in the twilight like a dying star.
The rain has stopped. It's clear, and so
are the roads to your penultimate destination: Litchfield Hills and The Mayflower
Inn. "Unfolding beyond every bend of
the area's meandering roads," your guide
describes, "is a Classic Currier and Ives
landscape of 18th and 19th century salt-
box farmhouses, red cabins, imposing
white clapboard mansions, stone walls,
and quiet lakes."
Your route winds down from Twain's
house on a Hartford hill to the quiet
towns of the Litchfield Hills area, frequented by city dwellers who don't mind
driving only an hour from New York.
You can't understand why anyone would
leave willingly: It's an idyllic postcard, a
land bereft of chain stores and parking
lots. Do the people here ever eat anything
besides crumbling scones at fire-lit coffee
. shops? The only thing missing is sin, and
you can't help thinking city dwellers have
come here to expunge it.
You're looking for the historic
Mayflower Inn, located at the top of a
hill in Litchfield Hills. Once a private
boys' school, it is now a gourmet restaurant housed a posh hotel, and one of the
four things you're supposed to witness
before the Reaper.
The full moon rises above the hills,
illuminating an oversized Georgian mansion which must have been a simple
farmhouse at one time, now couched in
