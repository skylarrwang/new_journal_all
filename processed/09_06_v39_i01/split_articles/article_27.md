1972), "Law School

Refuse to Broadcast" (February 15, 
1972). 
Students were concerned that 
Yale was not doing its part to 
attract minority applicants. An 
April 12, 1972 YDN editorial 
expressed an undergraduate belief 
that minority recruitment should 
be the University's top priority. "It 
is not merely enough to accept 
minority students," it read. "The 
University community must make 
every effort to [ e] nsure that these 
students find Yale a rewarding and 
fulfilling place." 

One stride toward self- improve-
ment was spearheaded by Yale 
President 
Kingman 
Brewster. 
Brewster commissioned a commit-
tee to collect information from 
alumni, faculty, and students and 
use it to produce "broad recom-
mendations concerning the future 
of Yale College over the next 20 
years." Because of the charged 
atmosphere, it was clear that these 
recommendations would address 
issues of race. The committee's 
findings spurred the creation of 
the Ethnic Counselor Program. 
The University modeled the eth-
nic counselors after the residential 
freshman counselors, but the two 
types of advisors are ultimately 
chosen by two distinct groups: 
College deans select the residential 
counselors, while the deans of 
Yale's four Cultural Centers choose 
12 rising seniors to be ethnic coun-
selors, pairing each with a residen-
tial college that is not necessarily 
their own. Ethnic counselors have 
two roles: to counsel all minority 
students in their assigned college 
and to assist freshmen who have 
checked a box deemed similar to 
their own. For example, all fresh-
men 
who 
identify 
as 
"Asian 
American or Asian, incl. Indian 
... 
Subcontinent" are divided between 
the ethnic counselors selected by 
the 
Asian 
American 
Cultural 
Center. 
Because a student's ethnic iden-
tity can't be reduced to a checked 
box, _the current systetn tnisplaces 
many freshmen. Elsayed ended up 
with two ethnic counselors during 
her freshman year. Her first coun-

selor sent her a flurry of emails 
about various events and study 
breaks, but Elsayed was uninterest-
ed, replying that she wished to 
remain uninvolved. In response, 
the University transferred Elsayed 
to a different counselor whose eth-
nicity was more similar to her 
own 
her first was an African-
American female, the second an 
Arab male. 

The switch brought Elsayed no 
closer to her second counselor or 
to the program. She wondered why 
the ·University would think she 
would better connect to someone 
of her own race. 

"[M]any students find their eth-
nic counselor extremely valuable, 
but others find the program redun-
dant," admits Dean Levesque. 
"Some freshmen resent that they 
were assigned an ethnic counselor 
without requesting one. 'Why does 
Yale think I need extra help? Is 
something wrong with me?"' 

Elsayed thinks similarly. "Why 
would I want to be friends with you 
on the basis of not being white?" 
After three years at Yale, she has 
amassed 
a 
diverse 
group of 
friends-one of the goals of a uni-
versity that stresses a diverse stu-
dent body. "I don't need to congre-
gate with other people who aren't 
white 
for 
stability," 
she says. 



Elsayed believes that the Ethnic 
Counselors Program shields._ stu-
dents from the social challenges 
that arise from living in a mixed 
campus environment rather than 
encouraging them to confront such 
challenges. "Isn't the point of 
diversity that you have to be on 
your own and defend your back-
ground?" she says. "It's a very for-
eign concept to me that you need 
to be with your kind." 

Still, other minority students 
may draw comfort from hanging 
out with students who share their 
ethnicity. When Pagkas-Bather was 
a freshman, the University was 
embroiled in the debate over affir-
mative action. Demonstrations and 
editorials against the admissions 
policy created a tense environment 
for some minority students, and 
thus Pagkas-Bather appreciated the 
support of her ethnic counselors. 

While Pagkas-Bather recalls 
handling several problems related 
to race during her tenure as an eth-
nic counselor, she emphasizes that 
the program should not be sirnpli-
fied to a "racial crisis center." 
"Thankfully, students don't assume 
that ethnic counselors can only talk 
about race and ethnicity" she says. 
Many of her discussions with 
freshmen weren't overtly related to 
race issues; the connection was 
more often irnplicit, like a subtly 
charged incident Pagkas-Bather 
recalls from her freshman year 
when she was asked by classmates 
if she could braid their hair. 

Last year, William Mao was 
Trumbull's 
ethnic 
counselor. 
"Though our title may suggest oth-
erwise and often pigeon...:hole us," 
he wrote in an ·e-mail, "we . ECs 
dealt with many of the same issues 
as residential counselors. But at the 
same tlme, some 1ssues may con-
tain a cultural or racial under-
tone/ dimension that [we] may be 
more sensitive to or more readily 
able to .see." 



counselor is part and parcel of 
everything we do," he says. "In my 
eyes, [that counselor] is indistin-
guishable from the others." 

But if an Ethnic Counselor is 
indistinguishable from a residential 
counselor, why bother with two 
separate labels? 

In his review of the program, 
Dean Levesque hasn't found a sim-
ple answer. He has discovered a 
"wide variety in the experiences 
that students have had with their 
ethnic counselor. . . The University 
wants to convey that two friends 
are better than one, he says, "but 
that is difficult to get across to 
freshmen." 

Overall, -the Ethnic Co.unselor 
Program attempts to be too many 
things to too many groups. For 
a minority 
student who regards 
his ethnicity as an integral part 
of 
his 
identity, 
program 
offers a social lifeline. For one 
who gives little attention to his 
ethnic background, the program 
is at best redundant, at worst 
belittling. 

Although ethnic counselors are 
trained to counsel all members of 
the freshman class, the false belief 
that they cater only to minority 
freshmen persists. "[We] won't 
deny someone help because they 
aren't of our race [or] ethnicity," 
says Pagkas-Bather. 

Some students conclude that 
because the primary responsibility 
of ethnic counselors is to serve 
only a segment of freshmen, their 
role and influence is less significant 
than that of residential counselors. 
Branford College Dean Thomas 
McDow speaks against this con-
ception. In Branford, "the ethnic 

The program alters its function 
for every student in the freshman 
class. While these altered roles may 
not be too complicated for one 
counselor to carry out, the subtle 
differences between them can be 
confusing to new students. 

McDow says it's about "striking 
the right tone." In order to appeal 
to various segments within the 
freshman 
class, 
Ethnic 
Counselor Program must empha-
size different aspects of the pro-
gram 
to 
different 
students. 
Unfortunately, when you strike a 
different note to appeal to every 
group on campus, the chord you 
strike is dissonant.
