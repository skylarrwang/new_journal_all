EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
On the patio of a cafe in a 
crowded Seoul shopping district, two teenage girls sip coffee and take turns nibbling on a wedge 
of green tea cake. One is dressed for 
school in a pleated navy skirt, crisp 
oxford, vest, and tie. The other, whose 
bangs sweep across her forehead in a 
trendy blunt cut, has thrown an oversized t-shirt over her uniform. In block 
letters, the shirt declares: ''YALE 
ROWING." 


Over six thousand miles from New 
Haven, Korean teenagers and nostalgic 
Eli expatriates can purchase Bulldog 
paraphernalia from an unlikely source: 
E-Land, a self-described "Harvard & 
Yale Campus Shop" with four locations 
in Seoul and dozens more throughout 
Asia. The franchise claims to be the 
only store in Korea to hold official 
rights to the University name, which it 
brandishes on t-shirts, blazers, sweaters, 
and even knock-off Chuck Taylors with 
a ubiquity that presupposes familiarity. 


Most Koreans, however, have never 
seen more than the name itself. Jong Pil 
Kim, an E-land employee, attempts to 
explain the University's popularity in a 
country that sends only a handful of 
promising youths to Old Campus each 
year. "Personally, I have never met anyone who goes to Yale," he admits, 
adjusting his "Richard" nametag and 
running his fingers through his spiky 
black hair. 


"But everyone in Seoul 
knows that Harvard and Yale are the 
top two schools. If you don't know that, 
you're crazy." 


He hops down from the store counter and points at the ceiling, where the 
pennants of American colleges spiral 
outwards 
in 
a 
nautilus 
pattern. 
"Originally, E-Land wanted all eight Ivy 
League schools. I believe they were only 
able to get the rights to Harvard, Yale, 
Princeton, and .... " 


He pauses for a 
moment, sneaking a glance at the forest 
green pennant hanging limply over his 
head. "Dartmouth." 


Throughout the shop, circular racks 
brim with pleated white mini skirts, 
oxford button downs, and distressed 
jeans, all stamped with university names 
and crests. It's Abercrombie & Fitch 
meets the Yale Bookstore, filtered 
through the lens of a Korean tourist. 


It's also incredibly popular; at least a 
dozen packs of giggling schoolgirls file 
through E-Land's doors in the course of 
an hour, contributing to the franchise's 
$13.3 million in annual revenue. 


Despite the variety promised by the 
whorl of pennants, nearly half of the 
inventory 
is 
devoted 
to 
Yale. 
Mannequins whittled to smaller proportions than their Western counterparts 
pose in T-shirts advertising a variety of 
nonexistent organizations—has anyone 
heard of the ''Yale Yacht Club?" Prices 
seem to correspond to both quality and 
authenticity: 
A 
baby 
blue 
''Yale 
Camping Vermont tee costs a mere ten 
thousand won (approximately nine U.S. 
dollars), while a seersucker blazer 
embroidered with a near-perfect representation of the navy college crest 
retails for about sixty bucks. 


But does near perfection signify legitimacy? Donald Filer, Yale's Associate 
Secretary and trademark licensing coordinator, attests to E-Land's "official" 
status. "The University owns the Yale 
trademark, which we license in areas 
other than education, like apparel," he 
says. "We've registered it both in the 
U.S. and internationally, at stores such as 
E-Land." Such an arrangement brings 
in revenue to Yale without damaging the 
University's identity as a brand. 


Yale works with three foreign licensing agents—middlemen in Korea, 
Japan, and Italy—"to ensure that the 
university's reputation is protected," 
says Filer. As a result, Yale whiskey and 
Yale machine guns probably won't be 
coming to stores near you. "We're careful to ensure that people don't put the 
name on whatever they want," he says. 
"Companies have to send us images, or 
samples of what they sell ... the office 
tends 
get 
overrun 
with 
them sometimes." 


But E-Land isn't simply selling apparel and accessories—it's selling a simulacrum of the university itself. For customers who have never seen the college, 
sailing, rowing, and jazz t-shirts, there 
are numerous faux-antique curios that 
contribute to the vintage atmosphere. 


Dark blue sconces jut out from the 
walls, casting a dim light on miscellany 
like an old-fashioned radio, a bust of 
John Harvard, and a framed Lux et 
Veritas crest. A weather-beaten leather 
armchair sags beside shelves lined with 
imported books—random encyclopedias, a ragged copy of a novel titled 
Freshman 
Quarterback—all 
beneath 
photographs of Harkness Tower and 
Harvard Square. 


As Jong Pil assists a shopper with 
a necktie, a petite female coworker 
with an "Olivia" nametag mans the 
counter. "My name is Judy," she says. 
In her midriff-baring, red-and-white-
checked oxford and denim miniskirt, 
she could be mistaken for the lead in a 
Korean production of "America: The 
Musical." In her actual role as shop-
girl, she embodies the inaccuracy of 
E-Land's representation. 


The employees say it isn't about contrivance or seamlessness; the stores are less a depiction of Yale than a construction of advertisements. The store's distorted portrayal is the last 
word on Yale. And while the contrivance of phony student groups seems 
harmless, the depiction of phony students in the store's sepia-toned advertisements is more disturbing: Nearly 
all of the models are blonde and 
white. Last year, 12% of Yale's incoming freshmen were Asian American; in 
E-Land's version of the university, a 
Korean teenager would be a racial 
anomaly. 


The homogeneous student body 
isn't the only anachronism perpetuated 
by Seoul's "Harvard & Yale Campus 
Shop." In addition to the countless 


Jong Pil Kim stands before a display of "Yale" merchandise.
