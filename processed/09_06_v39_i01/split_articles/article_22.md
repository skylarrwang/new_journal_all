THE MOST POPULAR 
plaza in Amelia, 
Italy surrounds Ia 
porta 
romana 
· Roman gate. Old 
men · with wrinkled 
faces are perma-
nent fixtures on its 
stone 
benches, 
where they . ~atch . and comment 
on the young teenagers, shop 
owners, and farmers who flow by 
in Fiats and on Vespas. This July, 
the elderly gentlemen sitting sen-
try encountered a few unfamiliar 
faces 
pale ones not yet tanned 
by the Mediterranean sun and 
lacking the strong features of the 
townspeople 
and 
overheard 
snippets of loud. English as fifteen 
Yale students swept into the tiny 
medieval town. 

Perched on the rocky, tree-cov-
ered hills of the Umbria region, 
Amelia's historic quarter 
il centro 
storjco 
is encased by stone walls 
that were constructed in the 
Middle Ages. From·ten p.m. until 
the early morning, its citizens per-
fect the art of seeing and being 
seen, Ia passeggiata, which involves 
walking up and down the main 
promenade, maybe stopping for a 
drink along the way. 

Coffee is 
served black, sweet, and scorch-
ing, ready three seconds after a 
request for "un 
cife~ per piacere." 
Stress 
is 
nonexistent; 
family, 
sacred; 
punctuality, 
relative. 

Discussions on any topic, from 
politics to relationships to cook-
ing, are heated, lyrical, and come 
accompanied by emphatic physical 
gestures. 

The other students and I were 
enrolled in Italian 130, an inten-
sive sumtner course for second 
year language students. 

While 
Yale offers a plethora of study-
abroad programs in major cities 
such as Paris, St. Petersburg, 
Prague, and Berlin, Amelia is 
hardly 
a 
thriving metropolis. 
Consequently, the arrival and inte-
gration of a group of American 
college students, however small, 
was 
conspicuous 
often 
ungainly. 

For at least the first week, we 
couldn't figure out how to stop 
the interminable offerings of 
pasta, veal, and wine at every meal. 
My host mother was so horrified 
by my habit of leaving the house 
with wet hair that she presented 
me with a blow drier. The family 
I stayed with was even more dis-
mayed by my obsessive punctuali-
ty, encouraging me to eat slowly, 
nap generously, and cultivate the 
art of relinquishing control. 

Our host farnilies and neigh-
·~ 
bors eased the ffansition. When a 
classmate expressed a PJl-SSion for 
,-,. 
toasted bread covered with olive 
oil, tomatoes, and garlic 
a tradi-
tional type of bruschetta · his 
family cooked the dish over and 
over again. Another student, who 
demonstrated an interest in the 
arts, was welcomed into her host 
parents' glass blowing workshop. 
One host father took his Yalie to 
his orchards, patiently showing 
her the trees he bred and cross-
pollinated as a hobby. 

In the late afternoons, my host 
sister Sonia and I returned home 
for pranzo, the huge midday meal. 
The dishes seemed soaked in deli-
cious, nutty olive oil, which came 
partially from the olives grown in 
the grove outside my bedroom 
window, which are brought to the 
frantoio, or factory, by local fami-
lies. 

The three parts of the 
olive 
flesh, oil, and seed 
are 
separated by machine, then the oil 
is filtered naturally by gravity and 
bottled. 

The slow, meticulous 
nature of the process reflects the 
attitude of ilie entire town. This 
was also how we learned Italian-
slowly, naturally. 

Over the weeks, our "field-
work" became much more impor-
