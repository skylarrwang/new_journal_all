sleep on couches and do poorly at 
debate." 

In its own tight-knit world, great 
debaters are recognized. They can easily 
become · famous 
or at least, famous 
among the right hundred people. At a 
recent tournament, teams discussed a 
cocky, ursine debater from William and 
Mary the way movie buffs discuss Harvey 
Weinstein. Another debate alumnus 
became gossip-worthy when he started to 
clerk for the New York Court of Appeals. 
The skills they hone in debate make 
them better speakers, better leaders. 
Because the subculture is large enough, 
outside recognition is less significant than 
inside glory. Many judges and politicians 
are former debaters and belong to a net-
work that rivals Skull and Bones, so it's 
easy to understand why high school 
champs expect a little pull with the admis-
sions departruent. The tournaments may 
only matter to other debaters, but many 
participants will remain in the debate cir-
cuit for the rest of their lives. 

And why would they leave? Outside of 
debate 
culture, 
Schneller's tiger is 
markedly less impressive. If people 
haven't heard about the APDA National 
Championships, they're unlikely to be 
impressed with a ftfth place finish. Few 
outsiders understand how mentally rigor-
ous debate is. Even at the tournaments, 
debaters tend to arrive and leave unno-
ticed by the rest of the Caf!lpus. 
typical debate trip leaves Friday 
afternoon and returns 
late 
Saturday night, leaving Friday 
night open for inter-collegiate revelry. 
These are, after all, college students. 
Many debaters show up for the next 
morning's fourth round in less than per-
fect shape. "It's impossible to win fourth 
round," says Ariel, "because you're usual-
ly up against someone who slept more 
and drank less." A team can usua11y lose 
one of the five preliminary rounds and 
still make it into the bracket, so many 
debaters simply factor in a fourth round 
loss from the outset 
small price to pay 
for a raucous night. 

After sleeping just six hours on the 
floor of last night's party at an MIT tour-
nament, few Yale debaters are ready for a 
9 a.m. car ride. One debater is curled up

The entire debate team revels at Mory s after a semester of tournaments. 
find him after the party's hosts had 
already left. Also abandoned at the suite is 
a portly kid in an oversized cowboy hat. 
No one knows who he is. He rides with 
them in the car back to the tournament. 
Back at the main building, it is difficult 
to tell who is hung-over and who is not. 
Men wear ties; women wear skirts. 
Debaters sip coffee and pass around legal 
pads and laptops. Garbage bags and lug-
gage are flung over the chairs. Almost 
everyone is explaining something to the 
person next to them. At any given 
moment, people tick off points on their 
fingers, in true debater style. The group 
from the party, still half asleep, slowly 
~ 
take their seats. 

Lena, a Brandeis debater, describes the 
room's occupants: "Of the people who 
come to the party, half of them get drunk 
enough that they're uncomfortable fourth 
round. Of them, some percentage are still 
drunk for fourth round. And others are 
about to start drinking." After the fourth 
round, most teams know whether they'll 
make it into the elimination rounds. If 
they know they won't, they are stuck in an 
auditorium with no other amusements, 
leading some to pop open beers or dis-
creetly sip from flasks. A man walks up 
the aisle in a Santa Claus hat, ca11ing out 
for whoever paid for a handle of Black 
Label. After a moment, he finds him. 

While the drinking seldom gets out of 
hand at debate functions, it explains why 
most participants don't view tourna.f!lents 
as hampering their social lives. This is the 
party they want to go to, these are the 
people they want to see 
the same peo-
ple they saw last week and the week 
before. Most debaters don't come for the 
trophies 
many throw theirs away. The 
ones that end up being kept are the 
bowls, goblets, and plates that you can 
drink from or eat off of. In the past, the 
Yale Tournament has given out Xboxes 
and iPods, and at the last tournament they 
gave out margarita pitchers 
useful for 
the next tournament's Friday night 
merry-making. 

But if most debaters keep coming 
back to see their friends, there are still 
those, like Ariel, who are in it for the 
glory. Debate, like many sports, can simu-
late war, and many of its practitioners 
approach it with their own sort of 
bloodlust. 

"I just really like beating people at 
things," Ariel says, explaining the draw of 
debate. '~d it's not just some random 
thing. It's like in poker. When I win, I 
won because I was smarter than they 
were, and I get recognized for that. 
People who are really good get to be real-
ly well known." 

Well known, at least, among a 
select few.
