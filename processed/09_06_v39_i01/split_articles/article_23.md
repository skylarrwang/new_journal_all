tant than homework. For our group, 
this enchantingly secluded town was a 
classroom without walls, schedules, 
or blackboards. 


Although we had 
three hours of grammar instruction 
with two Yale professors every morn-
ing, our real learning environment 
was Amelia itself. 


As our class acculturated, some of 
us began co forget basic English 
words and attempted to speak to par-
ents and friends back home in Italian. 
We asked waiters and cashiers to 
avoid speaking to us in English, 
assuring them: 
"St~ si parliamo ital-
iano"-"Yes, yes we speak Italian." 


With these words, we received smiles 
and winks across counters. We 
screamed "Forza Azzlld' alongside 
the tOW!)Speople and waved Italian 
flagsÂ·"from_ the windows of cars, join-
ing tlle.;nidnight parade in celebra-
tion-of Italy's World Cup victory. By 
the end of July, we no longer felt like 
guests. 


Eventually, some of us were mis-
taken for natives. Tourists even asked 
for directions. At the sweltering 
Roma-Fiumicino airport at the end of 
my stay, I heaved my two overweight 
suitcases onto the scale. The Alitalia 
attendant asked me, "How many 
bags?" I responded, "Due." We chat-
ted in Italian, complaining about the 
heat. Italian 130 had evolved into a 
course that had no set boundaries, 
that followed us out of Italy. 


On my last morning in Amelia, 
my host parents took me to the small 
bar opposite Ia porta romano for a cap-
puccino and a pastry filled with liq-
uid chocolate. 


It was a gray day, 
heavy with parting, and our words 
were few. The old men were already 
perched at their roost, reading news-
papers and debating. 


As I shared 
their break-of-day ritual, I wondered 
how I had ever grabbed a granola bar 
for breakfast on the road. The old 
men cast curious glances at my light 
hair, my long limbs. "Odd," they 
must have thought, "not a word of 
English."
