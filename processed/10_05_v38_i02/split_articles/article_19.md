changed his mind. The erratic 
process has disillusioned many 
students, · including Shalek, who 
asserts, "Yale students believe in 
democracy and the free and open 
exchange of ideas. Rebecca and 
Dan duking it out for a seat in 
November in March was not 
that." The committee is meant to 
represent the larger Ward 1 com-
munity; in reality, its organizers 
struggle to find enough partici-
pants. Gonzalez remembers hav-
ing to beg two women to serve on 
the co·mmittee in 2001 so that the 
pro.cess could somewhat reflect 
the Yale} C?mmunity. The students 
-
.. 
willing .. to serve are often those 
already dedicated tq_-/New Haven 
politics. As ~vres.ult, to observers 
like Shalek, the· co-mmittee seems 
. -v· 
stacked wi~h ~}re:-presentatives of 
,r 
Yale's activist community. 

Approval by this small, spe-
cialized body should confer no 
more than an official stamp to a 
strong candidate. But in the world 
of Ward 1, it breeds unstoppable 
candidates like Livengood, who 
become alders without ever win-
ning a real election. These ambi-
tious alders are merely beginnjng 
their careers, which many intend 
to reach beyond the Board and 
beyond New Haven. The three 
most 
recent 
alders 
Healey, 
Gonzalez, and Civin 
all left 
office during their final summers 
as alder to pursue loftier goals. 
In this 
situation, 
the 
Mayor 
appoints a temporary alder, always 
in the past the Democratic nomi-
nee, to fill the seat. It seems that 
Yale's political insiders have found 
a way to hand-pick a candidate 
from their midst and vault him 
or her 
uncontested 
into power 
as a representative for us all. What 
politician would not jump at 
the chance to land a position 
without contest? 

Not Livengood, for one. She 
began · her 
campaign 
for 
Democratic nomination in part 
because she was asked to run. She 
. 
is not alone. Few successful candi-
dates for Ward 1 Alderman have

made that decision on · their own. 

Gonzalez puts it down ·to the 
process of leadership 
leaders are 
constantly on the lookout for oth-
ers who will make good leaders.

ideal of democracy, · but the peo-

DeStefano's . chief of

Gonzalez

Past aldermen have

brought much more to the office ' 
than simply the "activist" position 
on certain issues. They were rec-
ognized by their peers because of 
who they were. It has also meant 
a willingness to take on the chal-


ple who know the most about pol-
itics and New Haven have made 
good choices in the past. Even 
though only a fraction of the Yale 
population has actually voted for 
them, the Ward 1 alders have gone 
on to be leaders, in New Haven 
and beyond. Ben Healey is cur-
rently exercising the skills he 
developed as alderman working as 
a . political organizer in Boston. 

Healey was asked to run, not by 
his predecessor Gonzalez, but by 
others active in the political com-
munity. Gonzalez was asked to 
:run by Civin. 

In a way, Shalek's critique is 
correct 
in :recent years, Yale stu-
dents have not decided who will 
be their alder. The active commit-
tee seeks out a nominee and then 
essentially hands down the seat. 


lenge of the job. The Ward 1 alder 
gets paid $2000 a year for count-
less hours of work and dedication 
and for shouldering the burden of 
representing Yale in what can be a 
hostile adult community. It's a 
tough position to hold, especially 
for a young idealist. 

Several past alders have 
learned that lesson. Morand, who 
once worked on a campaign for 
the recognition of Local 34, now 


works for Yale. Public service 
made him see, he says, the v~lue 
of the private sector in getting 
things done. But in the reality 
of New Haven politics, getting 
things done can be a challenge. 
The Ward 1 alder holds one vote 
on a board of thirty others. 

Healey, like one of the idealistic 
freshmen Livengood hopes will 
vote for her, ran for alderman as 
a first-year without fully under-
standing 
that 
challenge. 
"I 
thought it would be valuable as 
a pulpit for things I cared about," 
he said. "I thought you had 
huge power to make changes right

Livengq.c-fd/has learned that 
·

lesson well ·from her predecessor, 
and in debates, she constantly 
reiterates that she is proud of the 
relationships she has already built. 
Her success in this area extends 
not only outside Yale, but on 
campus. Dan Weeks, Livengood's 
former opponent, and core mem-
bers of his campaign staff, are 
now working on her campa~gn. 
She already realizes what Healey 
had to learn 
that the seat is not 
just a means of pushing her 
beliefs. In one of the most con-
tested political issues this fall, 
Livengood had to abandon any 
straight-forward 
allegiance 
to 
labor in order to navigate Board 
politics 
successfully. 
DeStefano has supported alder 
Carl Goldfield in his bid for the 
Board presidency against Jorge 
Perez, and although the unions to 
which Rebecca is accused of 
being beholden support Perez, 
she has endorsed Goldfield. 
"The hardest decision I had to 
make on the Board was voting for 
Carl," Livengood 
said. "That 
meant I had to break with a lot of
