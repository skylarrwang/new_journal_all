Since 
the first under-
. . 
graduate became Ward 1 alder just 
over two decades ago, the position 
has gradually in-creased in impor-
tance on the Board of Aldermen. 
Few New Haveners vote in the 
aldermanic elections, and, for some 
alders, allocating a thousand dollars 
to fix a few fire hydrants in their 
ward will guarantee a content con-
stituency and a reliable string of 
electoral wins. Ward 1, however, has 
few municipal problems and a core 
constituency that wants its alder to . 
act as a leader on issues whose 
import reaches beyond Old Campus. 
The ideal Ward 1 alder is a bright kid 
with big ideas, ready to lead the 
Board, and to remind its veteran 
members that there can be more to 
city governrnent than flre hydrants 
and street lights. Recent Ward 1 
aldermen have focused their politi-
cal energies on flashpoint issues:

a public 
school writing workshop leader, and 
now an alder. But Shalek has his 
own brand of idealism. While 
Livengood is idealistic about the 
type of jobs the YNHH Cancer 
Center can offer, Shalek is idealistic 
about Yale students and democracy. 
Much of the hard-core Democratic 
community· including the 
Yale 
College Democrats, New Haven 
Action, a group started by New 
Haven fanatics to organize issue-
based movements in the 
city, 
and many campaign staffers of 
Dan Weeks, her opponent for 
the Democratic nomination last 
spring 
has 
rallied 
behind 
Livengood. Even so, Shalek trusts 
his mainstream platform to do what 
has never been done before: inspire 
the masses of typically apolitical 
Yale students to turn out for a local

here are three differeh t 
voters in Ward 1: The New 
Haven politico who will 
turn out no matter what. The eight-
een-year-old freshman, an excited 
first tirne voter. And the average 
Yale student, either strategically reg-
istered at a parent's address in a 
swing state, or not interested 
enough in local politics to makejt to 
Dwight Hall on election day. In the 
past two decades, no more than 7 50 
students, less than a third, have 
voted in an aldermanic election, a 
statistic consistent with most alder-
manic 
races

who feel strongly about this elec-
tion. In an election with low 
turnout, those 250 newly registered 
voters could keep Livengood in 
office, if 
they show up 
vote for her. 
Livengood's dedicated and pro-
fessional staff is key to the success 
of her voter registration campaign.

These two women, as well as 
Livengood and her campaign man-
ager Suzanne Kahn, understand the 
importance of having conversations 
about the issues at hand. Livengood 
herself learned Ward 1 politics 
while working on Healey's success-
ful campaign against Dan Kruger in 
2003. Healey's philosophy on h<?w 
to win: "You talk to every voter, like 
anywhere else. The truth of it is, it's 
not rocket science." Livengood's 
campaign staff Yalies whose ties 
range 
from 
Roosevelt 
Institution, a non-partisan, progres-
sive 
student 
thinktank, 
to 
Undergraduate . Organizing 
Committee 
may share Livengood's 
idealism, but, if there is one thing 
that grounds them in political real-
ism, it is the need to talk to voters. 
In a race this personal, voters often 
choose the candidate they've met. 
Five weeks before the election, 
Brett Edkins, Shalek's campaign 
manager, was not releasing figures 
about the Shalek campaign's voter 
registration. The Shalek campaign 
has a far loftier goal than registering

untried freshmen, anyway. 
te~ 
"I t may sound silly," said Shalek, 
"but I want to talk to the fraternities 
and the sports teams." 
Silly? Not at all 
Shalek believes 
that only wit~ the participation of 
th ese fringe groups will Ward 1 have 
real democracy. The voice of Yale in 
New Haven politics has long been 
dotninated by the type of students 
wh o work in the Mayor's office or 
join issue-based groups like the Yale 
Student E nvironmental Coalition. 
The rest of Yale, alth ough m ostly 
D ernocratic, 
does not suppo rt 
G E SO, as Livengood and Healey 
do. Shalek's vision for Ward 1 is a 
participatory democracy, with high 
registration and high turn -out. As 
the self-designated mainstream can-
. didate, he must engage these silent 
tnajorities of average students in 
order to win. His vision of all-out 
democracy, 
however, 
does 
not 
demand the wearying, but tested 
technique of door-knocking. Shalek 
is chasing a renewed enthusiasm in 
unlikely places for local politics, a 
bigger and vaguer prize than 250 
voter reg1strat1ons. 
Although Shalek did not win the 
Yale College D emocrats' endorse-
ment and his campaign shirts have 
only just shown up on campus, cam-
paign manager _ Edkins is not wor-
ried. Shalek has been meeting one-

on-one with individuals in the Yale 
community that a campaign staff 
m.ember described as "leaders in 
their social groups." Besides his own 
connections with the YES and the 
hockey team, his staff has ties to the 
Yale College Democrats, a cappella, 
and the Yale Globalist. The Yale 
Political Union d~bate may have had 
a bad outbreak of bright green

man his friend Nick would be.

"I've heard that one

former 
less, they all claimed, as Shalek 
does, that their first loyalty was to 
Yale students 
not to the Mayor's 
office, the University itself, and 
especially not to the unions. 
Why were they so decidedly 
beaten? The triumphant alders do 
not remember their ·opponents as . . 
particularly competent politicians ... 
Of his opponent Witek, Morand 
remembers, 
"Tom 
Witek 
had 
grown up in a city, but that wasn't 
compelling. We debated, and when 
they asked him about the city budg-
et, he had a 
deer-in-headlights 
look." 
When Gonzalez, Ben Healey's 
predecessor as alderman, ran for 
the job, his opponent Bob Kokta 
ran up a relatively impressive num-

chief of staff and a ·

alderman. "A lot of 
people 
want

N ineteen-year-olds 
tend to have very 
sharp 
minds, 
everywhere they see 
injustice." 
And, in fact, 
Shalek's strategy is 
not a new one. His 
accusation 
that . 
Livengood is too dis-
tant from the Yale 
community 
recalls 
Dan Kruger's attack 
eers a 
tS 
on Ben Healey two years ago, as 
well as attacks in older races. In 
1995, Tom Collins portrayed him- · 
self as a Yale man in contrast to 
Josh Civin's New Haven activist. 
(He lost, 28 to 312.) In 1989, Tom 
Witek called Mike 
Morand 
"Democratic Socialist" advancing 
his "homosexual agenda." (He lost, 
31 to 4 7 5.) 0 f course, they were all 
Republicans, and Shalek, though 
running as an Independent, calls 
hitnself a Democrat. But regard-

over eighty. "He was 
really sweet," said Gonzalez. "He 
canvassed his heart out, and the 
debate was so uncomfortable." 
(Kokta, apparently, stuttered.) "I 
felt bad," Gonzalez added. "It was-
n't fun." 
All of these outsiders shared a 
basic problem: where to find a 
devoted, politically savvy staff, if 
not from Yale's community of die-
hard activists? As Healey explained, 
"A neophyte who hasn't been

involved will have a much harder 
time building that organization and 
communicating to students the rea-
son for greater involvement in 
the city." 
he last time that Ward 1 
saw a Democratic pri-
mary was in 1989. In 
theory, a strong Democratic chal-
lenge should take place in a pri-
. mary, not in the actual election. 
But Connecticut primaries take 
place during the first few weeks of 
Yale's school year, so that a,ny suc-
-cessful candidate would have to 
start campaigning in the spring.

About 
fifty Ward 1 citi-
zens (the number 
varies from year 
to year) weigh the 
potential of the 
aldermanic hope-
fuls as candidates 
and as city lead-
ers. The process is far from per-
fect: Four . years ago, on the day 
before the vote, the nominating 
committee almost disbanded and 
one of the candidates dropped 
out of the race, only to rejoin 
within 24 hours. Last spring, in 
the next major nomination battle, 
Livengood walked away with the 
nomination, but a scandal ensued
