The Cup to which the lid belongs is 
the trophy historically awarded to the 
winner of the annual Harvard-Yale 
Croquet match. For 130 years, the 
Saturday before the big Thanksgiving 
game, Yale and Harvard have squared 
off on the football field. They spent the 
day avoiding the sweat of the gridiron 
and the fracas of the tailgate, dressed in 
white linen and engaged in a vicious yet 
civilized match of six-wicket croquet. 
This six-wicket, or "professional," 
croquet bears little resemblance to the 
game you once played in your grandpar-
ents' backyar.d. With six wickets and a 
stake spread across a 105x84 foot 
greensward, there is plenty of room for 
maneuvering 
a~.d executing precision 
shots. Throw in:. ··an opposing team 
- . 
doing their best, tf> k'~ock your ball out 
of the way and Wickets that are only 
two millimeters wider than that ball and 
you've got what Mark Reach '02, one-
time captain of the Yale Club Croquet 
Team, describes as a combination of 
billiards and chess: 
a game that 
demands physical skill and calculated 
strategy in equal proportion. In com-
parison, he says, any other variant of 
the sport is "like using chess pieces but 
playing checkers." 

At its peak, the Yale Club Croquet 
Team could use those chess pieces 
more adroitly than any other university 
team in the world. Its achievements 
include a 1991 World Championship, 
besting Oxford and Cambridge on their 
home turf, a decade of good showings 
at Nationals, and sweetest of all, a 
twelve-year winning streak against 
Harvard. Martha Bagwell '00, remem-
bers beating the Crimson "pretty much 
every chance we had." Asked if she 
remembered a missing lid, Bagnall said, 
"I don't remember the actual trophy 
itself I remember the glory. It was a 
. . 
big consolation in the years when we 
lost the football game." 

But by the time Kit Reed announced 
in Harvard Magazine that the lid had 
been located and would be handed over 
"to anyone in possession of the base of 
October 2005 
the Cup and plausible bona fides," few 
remembered that there had ever been a 
big game played without a football, let 
alone a lidless trophy awarded to one of 
the winners. The solace provided by 
those fondly-recalled victories on the 
croquet pitch disappeared just when 
Yale students, confronted with a four-
year losing streak on the football field, 
most needed the Croquet Cup to turn 
to in their grief for the club croquet 
team had unraveled completely in 
the 
'02-'03 
academic 
year. 
Tom 
Migdalski, who has directed club sports 
at Yale since 1984 and witnessed a 
remarkable increase in their number 
an·d vitality, explains that "The nature 
of club sports is that, like the tide, they 
ebb and flow with student interest from 
year to year." 

Bagnall agrees, arguing that the 
small size of the croquet team made it 
particularly vulnerable. "We had seven 
members at our peak; two or three 
graduated each year. It becomes a crap-
shoot all ove.r. again." When Bagnall 
joined the team in the fall of 1996, its 
only other members were another 
freshman and two seniors. But she has 
other theories regarding the program's 
dissolution, which Reach also men-
tioned: the vast amount of alcohol con-
sumed at every game, and the fact that, 
as Reach asserted, on the croquet team, 
"Everyone slept with everyone." 'cyou 
can't take yourself too seriously when 
you're playing croquet," Bagnall empha-
sized. "Maybe that's what led to its 
demise 
too much partying." 

But while Bagnall cites revelry, 
Reach blames the team's demise on ten-
sion and fatigue on the national circuit. 
As a freshman at the University of 
Virginia in the fall of 2000, croquet 
prodigy Jacques Fournier 
call~d a 
"boy wonder" · by the United States 
Croquet Association 
helped persuade 
the directors of the national champi-
onship to change the rulebook so that 
the game looked more like the kind of 
croquet he had excelled at in high 
school. Outraged, the Yale team decid-
ed to boycott the tournament. At the 
same time, their other hallmark match, 
the Harvard-Yale Game, was crumbling 
under the force of Cantab laziness. 
"Harvard," charges Reach, "just never 
wanted to play." He attributes this sloth 
to a lack of structure in what passed for 
their team, saying tha.t the Harvard 
squad was "not serious" 
basically they 
"sucked." Whatever its source, this apa-
thy left the Yale team devoid of major 
competitions, unless it sacrificed its 
principles and registered for the check-
er game at Nationals. With little to look 
forward to, Yale Club Croquet suc-
cumbed to the tide. So is Bulldog 
Croquet left for dead? 

Very possibly, though there is a 
good deal of chance in these matters. 
Should the team reemerge, as Migdalski 
believes is possible and as Reach and 
Bagnall hope, there is a dusty pewter 
circle awaiting its resurrection. Reed 
confirms that, unsmprisingly, "no one 
has picked up the lid." But, he says 
assuringly, "Don't worry. It's safe."
