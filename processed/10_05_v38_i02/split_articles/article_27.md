classifying . hearing-one category 
for either side of the threshold. 

J\ssuming the threshold is inherent, 
we should be able to define it. But 
what set of features do we use to 
judge someone's ability to hear us? 
We're not consciously testing, or 
even watching for traces of hearing 
loss, yet if it's there, we can tell. . 
But Brian Scasselati of the Yale 
Robotics Lab is testing just that·-
using robots to model human cogni-
tion. 
As 
Scasselati 
admits, 
"Sometirnes we have to cut corners. 
We can't build a system perfecdy 
from the bottom up." Consequently, 
when 
helped 
build 
Kismet, a robot that recognizes 
scolding, praise, and other tones of 
40 
voice, the robot didn't even have 
ears. It instead heard through a 
microphone pinned to a lab assis-
tant's shirt "to eliminate back-
ground noise." Yet Kismet can cer-
tainly hear. When scolded, the robot 
immediately showed sadness, and 
when praised, its ears perked up and 
it sn•iled. It can appear happy, inter-
ested, sad, or angry, depending on 
what's said to it. Kismet is able to 
"hear" 
by 
recognizing 
verbal 
proso<:fy 
how something is being 
said. By interpreting and reacting to 
speech, Kismet crossed the thresh-
old 
morphing from a lump of 
metal to a hearing being. 

Rationally we know that Kismet 
can't actually hear us. Yet when 
Kismet is sad, its reaction is so nat-
ural, one can't help but feel remorse 
. for hurting its feelings. Despite this 
verisimilitude, Kismet does not 
respond verbally; you can see that it 
is a robot. Our criteria for hearing 
includes response, not just sensitivi-
ty to tones. There is something 
unconscious and innate about it. 
The cognitive device that constructs 
a hearing threshold is beyond 
our perception: While we don't 
know exactly how we can tell, we 
always can. 

An implant like Amy's helps 
humans cross the threshold in a sim-
ilar way without modeling the 
processes of human hearing. "The 
cochlear implant filters our frequen-
cies that are not within the rang~~ pf 
-
......., 
a 
human speech," Brian Scasselati con-
firms. A person with a cochlear 
implant isn't going to hear every-
thing; talking to Amy seems like talk-
ing to anyone else. Yet, Amy in une-
diately protests, "My interactions 
with you are highly contrived." At 
the end of the day, she still feels deaf 
inside. 

"If you were standing five feet 
further away, we wouldn't be able to 
have this conversation."
