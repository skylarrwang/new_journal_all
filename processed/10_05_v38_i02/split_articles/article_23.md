pre-approval of programs for each 
major will at least give Yale the 
infrastructure it needs to meet its 
lofty goals. 
IF I HAD A PENNY FOR EVERY 
TIME ••• 


but as the IEFP team knows 
well, more obstacles than 
the difficulty of getting 
credit stand between Yale students 
and the foreign country of their 
dreams. Since I took up my place 
on the study abroad preaching cir-
cuit, I have heard many of the same 
issues mentioned that Jones, in 
counseling students, confronts all 
the time. Juniors are just entering 
the heyday of their undergraduate 
careers: they have a preference in 
seminars and for studio space; they 
are leading extra-curricular groups; 
and they have tons of friends, most 
of whom aren't going anywhere 
until May. 

Yalies are our own breed, of 
course, so pointing out that the 
Yale experience can't be any less 
excruciating in its third year than 
the Harvard or Brown experiences 
probably is not the way to go. 

Instead, standing in front of tens 
of undergraduates two to three 
years my junior, I carefully compro-
mise my own humility for the sake 
of the cause. My real feelings are 
hard to convey because of the fleet-
ing flashbacks that flit around the 
edges of my life at Yale, whether I 
am at Hot Tomato's, in a NELC 
seminar, or in a presentation room 
at 55 Whitney. "I got to take on 
leadership roles in several groups 
during my sophomore year, and 
when I came back this fall it was 
easy to jump back in," I say, think-
ing to myself, there was a candle 
shop, on one of the covered streets 
in the Old City; I always meant to 
go back there. "I am having a blast 
this year, and I think it's because I 
can appreciate my friends and 
socializing at college more than 
ever" 

I would watch from the 
front seat of a coach bus as the lane 
lines split on the Damascus-Aleppo 
highway. I was always in the front, 
with an empty seat beside me, 
because I certainly couldn't be seat-
ed next to a man, and few other 
women travel alone. "My perspec-
tive on classes in my major is totally 
different now, and I think my under-
standing is much, much deeper." 

Pictures of Gamal Abdel Nasser 
still hang in occasional store win-
dows, frayed and faded, like the 
ones of Hafez al-Assad are slowly 
becoming, like all the buildings 
named for the October War of 
1973, like all the big talk. 

It is hard to explain, exactly--
but then, it's the gospel. I didn't 
need a compelling panel or slick 
website to convince me to decamp 
for foreign shores. I don't adore 
study abroad because I loved Syria; 
I loved Syria in part because I 
knew already that I would adore 
study abroad. And there are plenty 
of Yale students like me: probably 
on the order of 100 to 120 a year. 
For the rest, the choice is less 
obvious, and the possibilities 
less accessible. 

Even among members of the 
working group that produced the 
CYCE Report's recommendations, 
there was ambivalence. 

"People differed on whether it 
was essential," Professor Shapiro, 
its chairman, recalled. "Some peo-
ple thought we should shove every-
one out of here for some period of 
time. Others were more skeptical." 

In the end, they agreed to make it 
easier, not requisite. After all, he 
added, students who don't want to 
study abroad certainly shouldn't 
have to. 

But they should at least know 
what they are missing.
