Not a lot of American undergraduates study in Syria. 
Last year, to the best of my 
knowledge, I · was one of 
• 
two 
and neither of us was pleased 
when we learned about the other. 
Damascus is not that big a place, and 
if I didn't run into any of · my · countrymen at the handful of clubs in the 
Christian 
quarter 
or 
the 
few 
European-style coffee shops, I probably met them on election night, 
when the American Cultural Center 
hosted a midnight gathering to watch 
results come in, or the following 
morning, when dozens of us · yawningly converged on the · only restaurant 
in the city that was known to 
have CNN. In attendance were nearly 
all the Americans I would ·see on 
the streets of Damascus for the rest 
of the year: graduate students, teachers, Fulbrighters. There were enough 
of us that for a few hours on election 
morning, the restaurant's waitstaff 
doubled the price of coffee 
until 
Ohio was called and we all departed 
into the cold November sunshine, 
back to Syria and back to class. 
Class, for me, was two blocks away, 
, 
at l'Institut Franc;ais d'Etudes Arabes 
de Damas (IFEAD), a 39-student 
institute for foreigners operated by 
the French government and populated 
mostly by Europeans, with a smattering of Americans in the mix. 
. Classes were taught in Arabic by 
Syrian professors, many of them 
well-known writers and intellectuals 
forced by abysmally low pay at the 
University of Damascus to take on a 
second or third teaching job. Syria 
just established its first private university last year, too late to save its 
four public ones from the devastating 
effects of under-funding and 
over-crowding. In addition to the 
obvious difficulty of reaching university-level competence in Arabic, 
that means that the foreigners studying 
in Syria are generally concentrated at 
one of two private institutes, or 
at the Languages Center at the 
University of Damascus. 

Before I left the U.S., I petitioned 
Yale to approve both IFEAD and the 
University of Damascus as acceptable 
programs for a junior term 
abroad, since I didn't know yet where 
I would study. I also applied for, and 
received, a government fellowship 
which could be used to fund study 
at either place. To my shock, 
the Committee on Junior Term 
Abroad also approved both programs 
a testament, I assume, to 
their eagerness to facilitate the plans 
of enterprising students. 

They couldn't have doubted that 
I was serious. I had wanted to go to 
Syria since my freshman year, when I 
began 
studying 
Arabic 
with 
Professor Bassam Frangieh, who 
grew up there. Apparently, no Yale 
student had done a junior term 
abroad in Syria before, but that didn't 
mean the University could not 
help me. During my freshman and 
sophomore years, I met with every 
professor I knew of and a few 
graduate students 
who had studied, 
worked, or lived in Syria, taking 
notes and collecting tidbits of advice 
as I went. Ellen Lust-Okar, a political 
science professor who specializes in 
the Middle East, was planning to 
spend several months in Syria while I 
was there, so I recruited her to help 
me formulate a research topic for my 
senior thesis. One of our advising 
sessions months later was held on a 
bench in my favorite park in central 
Damascus, as we drank fruit smoothies 
from glass mugs that the owner of 
a nearby shop trusted we would 
return, as I always had before. The 
Syrian curator of the Near Eastern 
collection 
at 
Sterling 
Memorial 
Library, Simon Sanjoel, connected 
me with a friend who took me out 
for my first serious, multi-course 
meal at a Damascus restaurant. 


Afterwards, he introduced me to a 
fellow 
bookseller, who 
would 
become one of my best friends that 
year. It was hard to remember at the 
time, sitting in a restaurant surrounded by Lebanese weekenders 
in town for the cheap shopping, 
that Yale was the tie that had bound 
me to my new acquaintances but 
it was. 

The take-home lesson, I thought, 
was not terribly friendly, but it was 
realistic: Yale faculty could offer 
valuable resources to me on the 
other side of the world, but I would 
have to find them myself. 
The whole process of studying 
abroad is similar to mobilizing 
those resources: very doable, but 
heavily dependent on a student's 
initiative. The only department 
that presently lists a possible study 
abroad option in the Blue Book 
is 
Chemistry Department, 
which suggests that majors study at 
University 
of 
Sussex, 
in 
England 
an offer that, according 
to the Director of Undergraduate 
Studies, John Wood, one student 
took up last spring, in a rare show 
enthusiasm. 
Even 
if 
Committee on Junior Term Abroad 
has approved a program for Yale 
course credit, upon their return students have to show their DUS their 
overseas work in order to get credit 
in their major. That policy is similar 
to many other universities', but it 
lends an ad-hoc nature to a process 
that, given the consistent popularity 
of some overseas programs, could 
be streamlined. 

I sidestepped any real uncertainty 
about whether I would get major 
credit by making Syria my major: or 
rather, Near Eastern Languages and 
Civilizations. My second major, 
International Studies, posed more 
of a challenge, and I ended up 
dropping it this fall. Throughout 
the whole process, my point person 
at Yale was neither a DUS 
though 
I met with both of mine 
nor my 
Dean, though I met with him too. It 
was 
Karyn Jones in IEFP, who 
always responded to my emails and 
seemed to have one hand on the fax 
machine whenever I needed paperwork shuttled between departments. Other people were encouraging, but in the end I knew it 
would always be Jones, the study 
abroad warrior, who had my back. 
In many respects, I had it easy. 
For students who are Area Studies 
majors, concentrating in departments such as Latin American or 
East Asian Studies, the challenge of 
shaping a relevant study abroad 
experience is much easier than it is 
for science or engineering majors.

**Title: RAISING THE NUMBERS**
**Page number(s): 30**

Even universities with better-
established programs 
than Yale's have to work to 
bolster their study abroad 
numbers. Brown, for example, 
boasts expanded offerings for science concentrators, a change that 
the University's current Director of 
Office 
International 
Programs, Kendall Brostuen, says 
resulted from a concerted effort to 
find programs for science and engineering students. The office now 
publishes a handbook listing programs with high-quality instruction 
in the sciences, broken down by 
major. At Georgetown, a similar 
initiative was recently undertaken to 
expand opportunities for undergraduates in the Business and 
Nursing schools, where requirements 
are 
stricter 
than 
the College. 

In both cases, the Universities' 
study abroad offices parsed curricular requirements and traded program suggestions with faculty. 
This year, Yale's IEFP office will 
follow suit. Rowe and Jones plan to 
meet with DUS's and faculty in each 
department to create a list of programs appropriate to their majors, 
and the office's new web designer 
will make those lists accessible 
online. "If it is standardized within 
departments, that's going to make 
everyone's lives better 
the students 
and 
DUS," 
Jones 
explained. IEFP has also applied 
for funding from the Yale College 
Dean's Office to send faculty 
abroad for on-site reviews of programs in which their students have 
participated. 

Since 
CYCE 
Report in 2003, the office has been 
the recipient of much avowed support. That institutional commitment, Rowe and Jones agree, bodes 
well for the future of study abroad 
at Yale. 
The upshot of all this may well 
be that the typical Yale undergraduate experience will look very different in a few years. And in the meantime, an improved website and the
