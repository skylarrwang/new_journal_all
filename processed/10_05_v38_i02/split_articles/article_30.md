have a dirty little secret His name is 
Naked Man. 

I know. It's a funny idea that there is 
some New Haven man who lies completely 
nude in front of his window all njght, every 
rught, never under the covers, completely 
exposed, always revealing some traditionally pri-
vate region of his body for anyone 
..... ·, 
down the sidewalk to see. Most people don't · 
believe me until they see for themselves. Then 
they're as hooked as I am. 

I've seen the back of his head, but I've never 
heard him speak Actually, I've only ever seen 
him lie, motionless, with a telephone and a box 
of Chinese food perched next to his bloated 
gut, television flashing animal documentaries or 
CNN. But I cannot stop going to see him. 

Every time I walk by, I notice something 
new through the frame of his window; and 
catch a glimpse of a life I otherwise would 
never have known: a lamp with a tattered shade, 
a box of Tide detergent, a bicycle, a toe missing 
from his left foot. Something compels 
me to return multiple nights each week to 
his window to peer through the black security 
grate at his small and unchanging yet ever-
expanding world. 

The friends I often take with me--my con-
verts 
are usually incredulous. Some don't 
believe my story at all; others simply can't believe 
that I come to see him so regularly. But our jour-
ney never fails. At the end of that concrete rain-
bow there is always a bjg, fleshy pot of gold

New Haven's after-hours neon glow. Wa.Iklng by 
a white brick building shaped like a slice of wro; 
ding cake, I .ane and I caught sjght of an unex-
n :x:t penis. She grabbed my ~ 
pulled me 
back a few steps, and indicated a· small window 
looking direcdy onto the sidewalk Through the 
woven strands of the iron security bars, I had my 
first taste of middle-aged nudity. We stood 
dumbfounded, mouths agape, paralyzed with 
horror and ovetwhelmed with amusement Were 
our eyes deceiving us? Wa5 there rcal1y a naked 
man lying in full view no more than three feet 
away from his window in all his plll5-sized glory? 

Something about his posture. screamed for 
our attention. His knees extended across the 
bed, a racetrack steering my line of vision direct-
ly to his crotch. I was mesmerized. And with 
one simple sentence, the first mystery of Naked 
Man was hom: ''His penis is looking at us!" 

I Can't quite describe-rutd believe me, you 
probably wouldn't want me to 
what makes this 
staternent true; but it. is undeniable. He was 
sprawled in a lazy fetal position, and his penis was 
cert · 
in a prominent place. The frame of the 
window limited our vieW' into the apartinent, hid-
ing his face at the head of the bed There was real-
ly nowhere else to look :Maybe it is instinctive, 
when accosted by a naked person, to gbnce at the 
crotch. 'I hat I undc:t stand But neither I .ane nor I 
could shake the feeling that this particular crotch 
retw ned our stare. We took a moment to let the 
scene settle in and then continued on our way. 

Though the 
· 
sentient qualities of this 
man's 
served as conversation between 
I .ane and me for the next day or so, there was no 
immediate desire to 
retur n to his window 
and relive the experi-
ence. While funny, it 
was hardly titillating 
or pleasant Nudity 
tends to be 
only 
when 
the 
unclothed body itself 
is pJeasjng to behold. 
We 
were 
hardly 
warm for this man's 
fom1. His bulbous 
gut 
jutted 
out 
beneath his flabby chest, a bloated trunk attached 
bluntly to the skinny chicken legs of a mjddle-
aged man. He wasn't partia 1larly hairy, his chest 
only home to a few sparse patches of gray curls, 
but this didn't mitigate the overall effect No, we 
didn't want to see that agajn. 

It was only by chance that several days later 
I ane and I found ourselves 
dawn the 
same sidewalk around the same time of njght I 
don't think either of us even noticed that we 
traced the identical path of our previous jaunt 
But as we approached that odd buikding, we sud-
denly realized where we were. The light from his 
apartment spilled onto the sideWalk, ~and, to 
embrace cliche, we were drawn to it like mo~ to 
a flame. We approachecl the window t:inlldly, 
braced ourselves for disappointmen~- and 
received the mixed blessillg of a repeat perform-
ance. Nothing had 
Having overcome the initial shock of 
being accosted by a penis, we began to take 
in a little more of the Man's surroundings. 
The apartment was cheaply furnished, bright 
and harshly lit, yet oddly inviting. I jke the 
gaudy luxurious splendor of European 
palaces draws tourists to their vast confines, 
so did this apartment's stark, still ajr. We were 
like a pair of tourists marveling at an undis-
turbed, perfectly preserved scene. It was truly 
a living still life. He lay in the same position, 
his television still broadcasting Animal 
Planet, and the telephone still lay next to his 
gut as if he expected an important call in the 
middle of the night. The entire scene was 
exactly like the home of some historic figure 
lovingly restored and kept immaculate by a 
team of devoted curators. A few months 
-. 
later, Lane and I would visit the death place 
of Stonewall Jackson in rural Virginia. 
Standing there, behind the rail, looking at the 
bed in which Stonewall died, I would be 
reminded of our Man's eerie calm. 

At our second encounter, the initial inrt ig. 1e of 
Naked Man started to wear of£. Nothing had 
changed. He lito ally appeared not to have moved. 
As we walked away, I ane and I feared that we may 
have discovered not Naked Man, but Naked 
Dead :Man. Would a living person rea11y lie naked 
ctirecdy in front of a window every night? Ask any

few. 

We didn't think seeing this man 
naked was funny anymore. We sure 
weren't getting any sexual gratification 
from him, so why did we contin11e to 
go? I've puzzled over this conundnun 
many times since last spring It's possi-
ble that watching this man sleep satisfies 
some as-of-yet unreleased voyeuristic 
impulse btuied in my psyche, but I value 
the individual's right to privacy pretty 
highly and, in general, try not to active-
ly violate it. And fear not, fellow Stilesians 
I . 
do not sit in the co 
scouting the 
next Naked Man amongst my peers. It must be 
something about this particular man that keeps 
dt :w· 
me back. 

And yet, in some ways I do recognize in 
myself a desire to simply view him. I certainly 
feel some kind of 
t e) a 
enre gratification in see-
ing Naked Man, 
azntzn J an a narrattve. 
but I refuse to 
equate it with the 
gaze, just the sad buge of an aging man's ass: 
I've never been so relieved to see a bare bum in · 
my life. Unless he was a zombie, this now 
mobile Naked Man could not be dead. And 
zombies aren't real. We left relieved, feeling as 
though a great intrigue had finally been settled 

Up to this point, Naked Man had been a 
communal CXpUience. Neither I ane nor I had 
evu dared search him out and revel in the CXpC-
alone. But in the following two weeks, I 
couldn't resist reruming without her. Now that I 
knew he was alive, there was no clear reason to 
retnm. But I had invested so much time 
about him that I could not resist. And besides, 
though one mystery had been solved, a new one 
tit tgered We'd been there three times, and on 
' . 
every occasion we'd seen him naked I had to 
confit m that, no rna ttl: r what night of the week, 
OJ ae could always count on this naked exhibition. 
'Ihe next titne that I ane and I went 
lied 
and rernarked how long it had 
ba-u since VJe'd seen him. She looked at me 
shyly, and I knew she had retm ned. Fmally, we 
both confessed: I ane had gone about tc n times, 
same impulse that 
glues the collective stare to the eXploits · of 
Paris Hilton. But like Paris, Naked Man dis-
plays himself shamelessly. I can't claim that 
he's inviting me to come and see him or bring 
friends along, ~ut I don't think he wouldne 
offended. He's comfortable with himself in a 
surreal way. Unlike attendees of a naked party, 
the man does not showcase his cool, 
unashatned attitude towards his body, but sim-
ply his body itsel£ There are no pretensions. 
And 1 mexpectedly, with this attitude, the true 
allure no· longer revolves around his nudity, 
but abstracts it, allowing the imitge of his life 
to take center stage. He really is like a work of 
art, frozen within the window casement. 

What I~ve come to undustmd, especially since 
this semester began and I've found myself peer-
ing into his window sevr 1 al times, is that going 
down tl•at road has vuy little to do with the actu-
al physicality that is Naked Man His body holds 
no more surprises for me. Pee 1 iog through that 
grated window is much less about the promise of 
his 
and more about ex1JOSing my appre-· 
ciarion for it. He is the instigation of an intense 
and thorough introspection. 

Naked Man is depressing: His life seems 
exceedingly lonely, locked in the confines of a sin-
gle room. My view of him is limited by the 
boundaries of a window frame, but within that 
viewpomt I can see all the essentials of his life: 
From his bed and his small kitchenette to the toi-
let right inside the" apartment's entrance. It is at 
once a still life, a genre painting, and a nat rarive. I 
can imagine his movementS from one station of 
activity to the next, and whether it is as limited to 
the three basic activities of human life as I believe, 
that's all that I have the power to see. And I don't 
want to see anymor<:-

I don't mean to dehumanize the man by 
reducing his life to a display of bodily functions. 
Nor do I c1aim that only an artistic or theatrical 
production can be enjoyed and contemplated I 
embrace what he has so blatantly offered to share 
with the world 
namely, his-body at its most 
basic. It's beautiful His apartment, his bed, his 
naked fonn 
these truths serve to remind me 
that unden1eath these clothes and despite the lux-
ury (yes, luxury) of a Yale dorm, I am just like 
him. I sleep naked I use Tide detergent. I eat 
Chinese food. rve even been known to dream 
along to nature documentaries and Amierson 
Couper 360. 

Maybe I see myself m Naked Man and that's 
why I can't really feel any guilt for -watching 
Maybe, in his life, I see a 
er of the art that 
is so wanting everywhere else. I don't know. But 
rm pretty sure rn go see him tonight anyway.
