EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
'We're also going after Patricia of the film world at Yale. Michael Kerbel Clarkson. (H.e pauses.) I'm obsessed with actors! Meryl Streep is one of the reasons I want to be a fi1tnmaker." 

The reporter nods knowingly. 

"Oh, you've seen my picture on The Face book." 

Cut to a shot of a website showing Adam's profile. Next to his name, where his photograph should be, is an image of Meryl Streep. 

Fade to CU Sofia Coppola 'What makes a good ·director? Having a point of view. A strong opinion about how you want things to be." 

Dissolve Medium Shot Adam Davenport "I can see every shot in my mind ... I owe my realization that I have to be a filtnmake.r to being at Yale. Yale as a creative environment is unmatched. 

''Yale should never be an NYU or a Columbia Film School. If you come to Yale, you won't be a dumb artist. Yale has the potential for a .meaning-ful marriage between the academic and .extracurricular study of filtn." 

Fade to Exterior 53 Wall Street Interior The WHC auditorium, 53 Wall Street. Interior Michael Kerbel's Office Morning Kerbel turns to his computer screen and brings up Yale's Online Course Index. He types jilm" into the box that asks for ('exact word or phrase." The query yields ((198 courses found for Fall 2005." 

"I've come here because this pala-rial nothing, 53 Wall Street, is the heart of cinema at Yale. It's home base for the Yale Filtn Studies Center, a filtn collection whose scope speaks for itself. It also funds one of Yale's undergraduate and graduate filtn organizations, the Cinema at the Whitney, which just arrived on-scene this year. Let's see what's inside." 

Tottering on four-inch stilettos, tripping on!J once, she descends to the lower leve4 home of the Film S tutfy Centefj the nucleus "Now we have 10,000 titles. We have a study facility, 12 individual booths in which people can watch movies, one small screening room, and one seminar room." 

We see the new!J renovated auditorium with state-of-the-art equipment and surpris-ing!y plush seats. A shot from the front of the theater focuses on the reporter sitting in the back, with tinted sunglasses so large her face is almost total!J obscured. VO of the reporter: 

"I don't know who these critics are. This was a battle that I thought was fought and won decades ago. I don't mean to sound defensive-about it, but the concept that filtn is not an acaderuic discipline is not valid." 

Interior Au bon Pain-Afternoon David Pratt-Robson, Head of Distribution of Cinema at the Whi~ sits ()t a table across .from the reporter and eats a salad with ranch dressing. Messify. 

"So why are you writing this story? What is it about?" 


The reporter looks into her teacup for the answer. VO: 

"This is a story about the presence of filtn at Yale, entering into some kind of crazy new era. This is a story about how this campus phenomenon got started. I'm interested in how, maybe, ftlm at Yale is hurtling towards some kind of golden age." 

Interior Book Trader Cafe---Late afternoon World renowned film thinker .Dudlry Andrew, Co-Chair and Director if graduate studies if the Film Studies Program, and Chair of the undergraduate Film Studies mCfior, sits across from a young reporter 'bedaztfed in sequins. 

CU Qudley Andrews "I can be pretty clear . ~d direct about this. I thin~, ,f51r~ris . consistently a serious acad(!mlC -. dis.cipline at this institution ... Yale · h~,s. set;n something blossom that was iri "people's minds in the fifties. Whatever happens in this century, I think people who really know the debates of the past an:d the history of the past will be in the best position to make sense of what film studies is and make advances in it." 

Interior Davenport College Dining Room Noon Catherine Brobeck bas assembled a melange if lunch items on her trt!J. 5 he is wearing a floral-printed frock and Jackie 0. sunglasses perched on her head. VO if the reporter as the camera pans in on the two girls sitting at a small table ~ the windows. 

"She looks the part. Sources say she's a cineaste with credentials to boot: once President of the Yale Film Society, now Secretar·y of the Cinema at the Whitney, blah blah. The kid's done her homework. And her baby, Cinen1a at the Whitney, is a boot ning success: Those Friday night 35 mil-limeter revival screenings get packed to the gills, and I ain't talking fish. The money spurts from the WHC and the Film Studies Center crunches the numbers. · They're no YFS, a group that cashed in on showing sneak peeks. These fellas see them-selves as a couple of artisans." 

Catherine takes a small bite if her pineapple and cottage cheese. Wij>es her mouth. 

"My sole interest in a student organization is to show filtn, and I wanted to be part of an organization who would. Yale Film Society seemed unwilling to bring back 35 mi11irneter filtns. I don't understand why there is not a united filin community. There's no reason for any of the filtn organi-zations to be in competition." 

Cut to a shot if the Yale Film 5 ociety E-Board meeting in the common room if Jonathan Edwards College. Natalia Duncan, the groups president, is sitting in an armchair, leaningfonvard slight!J. 

''YFS is totally meant to be a social group, a: networking group. Our biggest and most exciting new devel-tm ts a me ium t: at's sna an a meanzn zn zs t arts e ucatzon. 

Cut back to Catherine. 5 he takes a sip of Diet Coke. 

''Everybody [at Cinema at the Whitney] cares about preserving the theater experience ... to bring an idea of curation to it like the Fi1tn Society at Lincoln Center. It's hard and expensive, but the effort is worth it. It's like a gift you give people." 

Interior Au Bon Pain Afternoon 


Alice Lov'!fqy, a PhD student who co-directs Cinema at the Whitnry is sitting at a table near the entrance when the reporter, in floral slips into an a4Jacent chair. 

"Before Yale, I was an editor at Film Comment magazine, published by the Film Society at Lincoln Center. It straddles the divide between the main-stream and the academic ... My doctor-al work is in comparative literature as well as film. 

"What the Cinema at the Whitney is about is expanding the presence of filtn on Yale's campus-to establish a ftlm culture at Yale that is based around ftlm viewing as well as. filtn studies." 

She pauses. 

"I think the professors, departmen-tal administrators, and students are all doing a great job, but I think· Yale has a long way to go in recognizing .filtn. The University just has to take the next step. Film culture is about the love for movies and the experience of movie-going. We are trying to give it a more stable institutional basis." 

The shot fades into the reporter talking on her cell phone. S uddenfy_ her voice, along with the frame, disappears. We see Professor Maria Rnsa Menocal Director of the W hitnry Humanities Center, sitting in a hotel room one time zone awqy, also talking on her cellphone. 

''It has evolved over the years. It allows us to have this artistic specialty of the Whitney. This symbiosis with the Whitney allows fil •n to become a part of other things. What begins to happen is you have more than acciden-tal marriages. It's completely cool." 

Interior Au Bon Pain-Afternoon David Pratt-Robson is chewing a mouthful of lettuce and crouton. 

''I could watch Casablanca a mmion titnes but eve g goes right back to the script. Everything is pointing to the dialogue; without the dialogue there wouldn't be any of the rest of it. 

''It's impossible to swtunarize it as to deftne .filtn is why I really love it." 

Exterior York Street Day Shot of the reporter walking, impulsive-lY tugging at the start of her blonde afro. VO: 

"It's the personalities that are con-tributing to this, each as much a direc-tor as a character. Film is a mediun1 that's snappy and sweet, culturally and academically relevant; bridging a rick-ety gap between work and play. It gives these books a little oomph, there's, as they say, a little prescient cultural meaning in this liberal arts education." 

Cut to Dudley Andrew. 

"Motion Pictures are just stories, narrative and image." 

Cut to Adam Davenport. The year is 2016. He is sitting in a director's chair, on a set, in Los Angeles, California. The sc~'!_e is crowded and bustling. Actors a?e· ~f!t of trailers, ha!f-clothed, with costumiers and :~ make-up artists jogging behind them. By thq_ wall is a crtift-seroices spread, delivered f?Y a Zone Dietfriendfy caterer. Grips and extra hands linger I!J the table and pick at some let-tuce. Adam stands up and people fall into place. The .lights dim. The production is Song of Solomon, written and directed f?Y Adam Davenport. A!frie Woodard is Pilot, Derek Luke is Milkman, Terrence Howard is Guitar, Samuel L Jackson is Macon Dead, and of course, Meryl S treep is Circe. In the background lulls the theme song, Song of Solomon. Vocals lry Audrey McDonald 

"Meryl, honey, could you do that one mote tune?" 

"Sure thing Adam. I wasn't really satisfied with that last take anyway.'' 

''This rin1e, more passion, more mystery." 

Interior Au Bon Pain Night Adam Davenport looks at the reporter, poised to speak. 

''I can already picture the trailer. It's weird, I know. But that's how I think."
