he best part comes right at 
the beginning, in a kind of 
staccato, when someone 
asks, "Where did you go?" 
and I get to respond with a one-two 
drumbeat: "I was in ... Syria." After 
that, few other questions are needed: I .am obviously extremely cool. 
People do have . questions of 
course, but n1ost of them are sim-
ply being . polite. Besides, however 
sincere their interest, it is unlikely 
to wear down my own reluctance to 
broach this topic. I usually try to 
change the subject as 
quickly 
as possible. 

It's not their fault they don't 
know what to ask: You don't have 
the questions until you go, until you 
trade what you're comfortable with 
for someplace unsettling, and then 
begin to feel comfortable there 
as well. 

But that day, as I watched about 
35 students file in, I wondered 
whether this might not be an hour 
for revelation, for conjuring words 
to fit feelings and reasons to 
account for my sense of dislocation 
or, more accurately, my sense of 
dual location. 

From the front of the room, 
Karyn Jones, Director of the 
International 
Education 
and 
Fellowships 
Program 
(IEFP),

glowed with her usual good cheer 
and devotion to study abroad in all 
its forms. She began the meeting by 
touting new chances. for summer 
study, ·then 
the 
Opportunity Fair, and the 200-plus 
international internships now avail-
able 
through 
office 
of 
Undergraduate Career Services . 

But, she added almost chidingly, 
a summer abroad is no substitute 
for spending a semester or even a 
year in a foreign country. "Yale is 
actually extremely supportive of 
study abroad on a number of lev-
els,'' she began. No student, she 
told us emphatically, has ever said 
to her that they regretted studying 
abroad. But several who didn't have 
admitted wishing they had. 

This, for me, was the gospel. I 
had heard it all before; but, from 
my seat in the front row, my eyes 
still drooped in a kind of possessed 
reverence for the sanctity of Jones's 
words. I found myself nodding fer-
vently. If I hadn't been worried 
about frightening all the potential 
converts sitting around me, I tnight 
have clapped. 

By the time I spoke, the audience 
had dwindled by almost half, but 
my task was, on the surface, no 
harder 
or less impossible 
than it 
had been to begin with. Syria hit me 
square in the face with more viscer-
al experiences 
major pa-radigm 
shifts, by the end 
than I had imag-
ined possible. Like beginning to feel., 
the weight of political impotenc_e· 
.. 
(that was a big one), or tempering 
ambition to suit a rusty, halting 
economy. 

Shrugging 
in 
unim-
pressed acceptance of conspiracy 
theories that tie in everyone from 
your 
government 
to 
m1ne. 
Accepting the control that random 
officialdom has over your life. 
Knowing history as tragedy. Always 
greeting your neighbors. Cooking 
something to bring to the lady 
downstairs after she delivers two 
kinds of desserts to your door just 
in case you're hungry. People in 
Syria think they know what is rea-
sonable and what others want 
because 
they 
understand 
how 
things work there 
just like we 
think we do, because we know how 
.... 
things work here. 

But therein lay the impossibility: 
I only had three minutes, so I 
couldn't say any of that, and 
because I didn't say it no one knew 
to ask. I got home more than three 
' 
months ago. The problem will not 
go away. 

In this case, there were a few 
questions posed, mostly for other 
speakers. One girl wanted to know

IEFP Office at 55 Whitney was, as 
always, getting the joh done. No 
one ever said international 
education should be proxi-
mate. 

IEFP's institutional capacity and 
range of programming has certain-
ly grown since then, but the num-
ber of students studying in foreign 
countries during term-time has not. 
According to Jones and IEFP 
Director Barbara Rowe, the number 
has held steady in the 100 to 120 
range for as long as -they have been

But of course, at Yale, 
people have said plenty of 
other things about it. In 
2003, one of the main rec-
ommendations 
Report on Yale 
College 
Education (usually called 
the CYCE Report) was to 
strengthen 
international 
education at Yale. In the 
rzences-ma or 
future, it said, students 
should consider time abroad "as an 
integral part of their Yale educa-
tion," and IEFP should use "all 
available resources" to expand pro-
gramn1ing and study abroad oppor-
. . 
tunities. 

Since 
then, President 
Richard Levin and College, Dean 
Peter Salovey have taken up the call 
as well, declaring the University's 
committnent to bringing the world 
to Yale and sending Yale out into 
the world.

here. Brown University, by contrast, 
had 541 students study ·abroad last 
year, 
University 
Pennsylvania, according to its web-
site, sends more than 600 students 
abroad every year. And even at 
Harvard, which acknowledged its 
deficiency in the study abroad arena 
only shortly before Yale did, 213 
students studied abroad last year, 
up from 130 two years before. 

Rowe reports that the University's 
tentative goal is to have 200 to 300 
students studying abroad during 
term-time by the 2007-2008 school 
year, but that strikes even her as a 
long shot. But apart from this step, 
Yale has. just established the first 
term-time study abroad program, 
due to open next fall in Beijin, 
China. Almost no depar-tments 
actively encourage majors to 
go abroad, and students who 
go anyway still have to figure 
out for themselves which 
e-
programs are strong . in their 
field, and how to get credit 
for participating in them. 

So as the CYCE Report 
predicted, many Yale stu-
dents still prefer to limit their 
experiences abr·oad to the 
summer. Still, Rowe antici-
pates great things to come of 
Yale's nascent commitment 
to international education. She says 
the emphasis will continue to be on 
summer and post-graduate oppor- . 
tunities. And even that will take 
titne. ''It takes a while to change the 
culture of the institution," she 
explained. "But as more people do 
it, I think more will follow." 

Her logic made sense to me, 
which I suppose is why I confront-
ed my own loss for words as a study 
abroad panelist. Because even if it
