LoUIS Cox, TI-IE OWNER OF C 
1, A 
clothing, skateboard, and vinyl toy store 
on State Street, is attending to an awk-
ward teenage boy wearing a vintage t-
shirt who appears to be asking nervous-
ly for a job. I can see how working for 
Lou would be the dream job for any 
teenager. 

Lou oozes cool. And the 
store speaks for itself. The art on the 
wall, the toys on the shelves, the projec-
tion of anime on a white wall .. .it's a lit-
tle New York, a little stree·t, a little 
hip hop. 

While I wait for Lou to tell the boy 
about the store, I curse myself for for-
getting to wear my edgiest dress. A few 
days ago, I read an article in which Lou 
described he clothes he sells as "hip-
ster," and t)ow I wish I had dressed 
the part. 

But Lou is' i~ci:edibly friendly. He 
tells me he wishes ·t,. had come a few 
" 
' ' 
days earlier when•T fould· have seen the 
latest exhibition, "Soul Brothers," fea-
turing the artwork of such famous graf-
fiti artists as Brat, Demo, Eros, and 
Sket. Their work hung around the store, 
forming an art show complementing 
the retail one. As Lou lists the various 
artists' names and attributes, I realize 
that I have absolutely no knowledge of 
this genre. 
My dress, even if I had 
paired it with funky earrings from 
Japan, would have gotten me nowhere 
fast. Apparently, there is an entire van-
guard of graffiti artists 
or, as Lou 
calls them, "legendary old dudes." 

Lou says graffiti is becoming "main-
stream:" "It reflects the largest cross-
segment of the market, reaching every 
day people, high brow, low brow." 

Graffiti has come a long way since it 
burst onto the streets and subways of 
Philadelphia and New York City. I, as a 
writer for an Ivy League magazine, am 
an illustration of that trend: coming 
face to face with graffiti art and think-
ing it's the new cool. I even purchase a 
t-shirt with a graffiti-inspired design for 
my younger brother, a member of his 
high school's concert band and Nexus 
game group, so that he too can be cool. 

Yet Lou's vision of Channel 1 is not 
merely about showing someone how to 
he a "hip individual," or how to say "I 
' 
cruise" and get nods of approval rather 
than laughs. Though Lou pulls this off, 
he is much more interested in creating a 
f usion of genres. He enjoys skating, 
snowboarding, clothes, graffiti, and 
toys. Channel 1 is his genetically 
enhanced brainchild. Art, he thinks, is 
the · center that holds everything togeth-
er: Everything in the store has an artis-
tic flair or design, most of it graffiti-
inspired. Lou is also collaborating with 
Cafe Nine, a club next door, to bring 
alternative musicians to New Haven, 
which has an art scene that Lou believes 
is burgeoning, especially in the Ninth 
Square district where his store is locat-
ed. The area reflects more of the 
"street art side of things." It's the place 
for "the guy sculpting the best whatev-
er in his garage. Smaller known guys 
are getting more talk." As Lou goes on, 
I like him more and more. He seems so 
genuine and down to earth, like some-
one all hipsters· aspire to be. If New 
Haven hipsters have an idol, it's proba-
bly Lou. 

Since I am a wannabe, it's not the 
artwork in Lou's store that piques my 
interest but rather the vinyl toys, partic-
ularly the "Eggsters." I really want to 
buy an Eggster 
each one is custom 
designed 
but I convince myself I will 
be wasting money on a plastic eggplant 
with a face. My favorite was designed by 
the graffiti artist Demo. Lou tells me 
that Demo tore up bits of vinyl and· 
pasted them on the Eggster to create a 
multi-colored, collage-like figure. The 
glow-in-the-dark Eggster might also be 
a nice addition to my bedside table. 

I leave the store knowing that I will 
come back for the upcoming free exhi-
bition. 
"Ratio 3/8" opened on 
September 30. "It's a vertical exhibi-
tion," Lou says, and offers further 
explanation because he can sense I do 
not know what a vertical exhibition is. 
The show will bring together twenty 
artists, each given an 8x32 inch panel 
with which he or she can "do whatev-
er." The artists' panels will be displayed 
side by side, creating a conglomerate 
piece of art. I imagine myself in a room 
full of graffiti artists and start to panic. 
I make a mental note to start planning 
my outfit, and to google Brat, Demo, 
Eros, and Sket before my next visit.
