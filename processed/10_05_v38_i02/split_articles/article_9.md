SAY YOU WRITE A BOOK. AND LET'S GO 
out on a lirnb--say it's a good book, a book 
chock full of clever theories and jaw-drop-
ping facts that people need to know or 
. 
. . 
study or even write about. Say you have 
already found a publisher 
no worries 
there 
and you're excited and a little bit 
scared as you prepare to bring your labor 
of love into the world. 
It might be time to face the fact that 
your book is useless. Sure, someone will 
read it cover to cover. your mother, defi-
nitely. Maybe your wife, possibly your col-
leagues. But for the most part, nobody is 
going to read your book. People are going 
to use your book. So you have to make it 
useful to the common reader, the kid who· 
wants to know who invented ice cream, or 
the guy who's digging around for a juicy 
quote on Virginia Woolf~s sex life. This 
person wants nothing more than a shortcut 
· to the heart of the matter. In other words, 
he wants an index. 
If you're publishing through Yale 
University Press, you might be sent to 
Jenya Weinreb after your book has been 
typeset. She runs the indexing departrnent 
from a tiny, glass-fronted office that over-
looks the press's vast, wood-paneled main 
editing room. Above her desk is a shelf of 
recent Yale publications 
a reference book 
on breast cancer, an encyclop·edia of 
ew 
England 
and .a neatly-typed list of the 17 
4 
freelance indexers who comprise her "sta-
ble." Although in the . standard book con-
tract the author is responsible for making 
and paying for the index, Yale University 
Press always offers . a way · out. "If the 
author says, 'This sounds really onerous,' 
we will hire the freelancer ourselves and bill 
the author," Weinreb explains with a grin. 
Indexing might be onerous, but it's 
nothing compared to what it was thirty 
years ago, when it required typing thou-
sands of key terms onto thousands of 
index cards and then arranging them by 
hand. Nowadays, the process is quite a bit 
simpler 
indexers use Microsoft Word and 
newfangled software like Indexicon to 
speed up the process of compilation and 
alphabetization. But Weinreb emphasizes 
that there is no substitute for the human 
touch in the early stages of the process. 
Typically, an indexer will read a given book 
at least. twice, circling, highlighting, and 
underlining words that are crucial to the 
meaning of the text. He has ·to keep a care-
ful eye ·out for references he'll combine 
into a document that is both comprehen-
sive and usable. This is particularly difficult 
since the index is typically the last part of 
the book to be completed; it needs to be 
spotless in about three weeks, one of the 
shortest turnaround times in the business. 
If you want to be an indexer, you can 
take a course 
Weinreb herself did years 
ago, for fun--<>r you can just plug away 
with brute determination and hope for the 
best a good reputation and a steady stream 
of jobs. Phil King, a soft-spoken YUP edi-
tor, knows this firsthand. He is one of the 
few full-time indexers to make the leap to 
an editing career, and he recounts his 
indexing days with an almost dreamy smile. 
'13asically word of mouth is eve 
· g 
in this business,'' he says. "I was a reporter 
at my college newspaper, and I was just 
shooting the breeze with someone I was 
interviewing, and he said he made indexes 
for books, and I thought, 13y Jesus, I want 
that job!"' For his first assignment, he con-
tinues, "someone desperate for an index 
sent me this really weird book about busi-
ness 
I never again did such a strange 
index. I got going from that I had one 
job on my reswne, and I started looking for 
other people who were desperate. It came 
naturally to me. Some people, I think, are 
just natural indexers, and some are not." 
A natural indexer, he and Weinreb agree, 
is detail-oriented, methodical, and curious, 
someone who doesn't wholly object to the 
idea of "toiling" alone at a computer, 
"type-type-typing all these words for days 
at a time." Most important, though, is a 
certain empathy, an ability to put yourself 
in the reader's place, and -pretend to know 
nothing about a book you've been poring 
over for weeks, to ask the questions a read-
er might ask or pinpoint the information 
that a casual browser might be looking for . 
· For all the type-type-typing types out 
there, the American Society of Indexers, 
Inc., provides an essential social and pro-
fessional community. It rnaintains a "Find 
an Indexer" database, hosts conferences 
with names like ''You Say Cookies, I Say 
Biscuits: 
Metadata 
and 
Controlled 
Vocabularies,'' and organizes get-togethers 
and peer review sessions (''No, we won't be 
sitting around peering at one another.") 
The society also tries to promote the art 
and science of indexing on a more philo-
sophical level. Boring and nitpicky though 
it may be, it's an important part of how we 
see the world. After all, civilization as we 
know it is organized around ... well, organi-
zation. Without a certain order, we don't 
know how to begin to make sense of 
things. The flip side of Phil King's belief 
that "a reader's needs are limited otily by 
your 
· 
' is, of course, that the 
indexer's job is precisely that: to limit a 
reader's needs, to boil a book down 
to a list. 
At the same time, when you're flipping 
through an index, these limits can feel mar-
velously enrichitlg. What a perfect distilla-
tion of the 1990s you get by browsing the 
index of Hi1lat y Clinton's autobiography, 
which juxtaposes terms like "Buddy (dog)," 
and ''budget deficit," "Stand By Your 
Man" and "Starr Kenneth
