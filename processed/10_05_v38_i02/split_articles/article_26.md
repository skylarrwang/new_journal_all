ing, or should they embrace the lan-
guage of the deaf community? The 
debate is complicated by the diffi-
culty of diagnosing deafness. Here 
at Yale, both the lives of students 
who identify as deaf, and the work 
of professors who are developing 
new conceptions of how we com-
municate, can help shed light on 
what it means to be "hearing."


Perfect hearing isn't nec-
essary to 
function 
in 
the 
everyday 
world. 
While 
newest leg prosthe-
ses 
have 
taken 
design 
principles 
from the legs of the 
fastest land-animal, 
the cheetah, Amy's 
hearing aids imitate 
human hearing, not 
the aural equivalent 
of the cheetah or 
the owl. The barn owl 
has four auditory 
cavities asymmetn-
rically distributed on 
its face so that the 
owl perceives sound 
from 
both 
sides, 
above, and below. If 
Amy refuses to wear 
a 
"hearing 
helmet," 
it is hard to 
imagine hearing aids implanted 
asymmetrically across her face. 
For Alina Engleman, a deaf 
graduate student in global health, 
deafness is a matter of identity. 
While some deaf people choose to 
assimilate into hearing culture, she 
states that "There are deaf people 
who do not see deafness as a dis-
ability at all who accuse deaf 
people who see otherwise as 'hear-
ing in the mind.'" Deafness to this 
group means being part of a rich 
cultural and linguistic minority. 
Ironically, Alina finds her disabili-
ty empowering. 
Hearing aptitude is almost 
impossible 
to 
quantify. 
Functioning ears don't guarantee 
that a person will hear what's said 
to him. Alina notes that "There 
are deaf people who are more 
hearing than the hearing, and hear-
ing people who are more deaf 
than the deafest." To prove this 
point, consider the people we 
know: Who has good hearing? 
Whose hearing is slightly below 
average? Who is deaf? There are 
no mainstream categories for dif-
ferent levels of hearing. "I can 
tell," Amy says, "when a person 
has hearing loss. They talk too 
loudly or mumble." Yet there are 
"tricks that deaf people use to 
make it appear that they can hear. 
You nod a lot, make neutral com-
ments or quickly change the 
topic." Amy's technique calls into 
question the way people judge the 
capacity of others to understand 
them. People are constantly com-
municating without even realizing 
they are doing so. 

Perhaps it seems unfair that 
Amy could manipulate her disabili-
ty to verify a boy had a crush on 
her. But he had already communi-
cated to her that he liked her why 
else would she have sent in a spy? 
We unconsciously look for signals 
non-verbal 
communication. 
When 
we're 
"heard," 
the con-
versation is smooth, 
without uncomfort-
able pauses or unac-
knowledged 
ques-
tions. Through the 
unwitting signals we 
exchange, commu-
nication transcends 
hearing. 

In a larger con-
text, hearing acuity 
is much more a mat-
ter of social con-
structs. In the eyes 
of the world, a per-
son is only deaf if 
he misses conversa-
tional cues. Hearing 
conversations with 
greater 
accuracy 
means 
nothing, 
while missing subtle 
conversational cues 
is everything. Yet, 
there is some medically-deter-
mined threshold that separates 
hearing and deaf. If we're above it, 
we hear; below it, we're deaf. 
Perhaps the threshold is 
imprinted in our physiology. Just 
past the eardrum lies a fluid-filled 
sac entirely responsible for our 
hearing: the cochlea, the same 
organ activated by Amy's hearing 
devices. Inside, there are roughly 
29,000 hair cells, each capable of 
detecting an aural frequency. These 
cells transmit to the auditory nerve, 
which carries electrical signals to 
the brain. But the complexity of the 
cochlea's function suggests that 
there cannot be only one way of 
being "deaf." A problem with the 
auditory nerve causes deafness in a 
different way than the death of hair 
cells. Alina's conception of deaf-
ness as identity undermines any 
"purely medical perspective." 

Considering such a threshold, 
Alina reminds the hearing popula-
tion that "each and every deaf 
person has a totally different 
approach to communication" that 
stems from difference in prefer-
ence, hearing, and experience. 

The knee-jerk response is to 
divide ourselves into the hearing 
and the deaf. As Alina asserts, 
"The cultural and social norms of 
the deaf community are totally 
distinct from the hearing world." 
This dichotomy reinforces the 
existence of an unspoken thresh-
old of hearing. Amy acknowl-
edges 
that 
division 
gives 
hearing-
impaired people a reason to feel 
disabled: "Early deafness puts 
you on the special track and that 
track usually doesn't lead to Yale. 
If I hadn't been integrated early 
and diagnosed later I might not 
be here." Judith York of Yale's 
Office of Disabilities responds, 
"I think I can surmise what Amy 
was thinking. If her deafness had 
been present since birth, it's like-
ly her parents would have taught 
her American Sign. Sign is not 
pure English. A non-oral person 
may not learn perfect English 
grammar and may miss out on 
writing 
skills." 
Consequently, 
such students might have difficul-
ties comparable to those of inter-
national students who immerse 
themselves in a culture whose 
main mode of communication is 
foreign to them. 

The distinctions between ver-
bal and non-verbal or deaf and 
hearing students are controversial. 
At what point are you deaf? 
Friends, neighbors, and co-workers 
refer anyone suffering from hear-
ing loss to a specialist. The special-
ist usually confirms the judgement 
that these people are on the other 
side of the hearing threshold. 

So how do we make that 
call? Despite those like Alina 
who believe that there is 
no scientific definition of 
deafness, a group of Yale sci-
entists are making progress 
towards understanding what it 
means to hear. 

Psychologists have identified a 
phenomenon called categorical 
perception of color. We've all seen 
a rainbow with its distinct bands. 
That rainbow actually exists as one 
continuous change in wavelength 
that has no sharp changes that 
would delineate red, from yellow or 
blue. Yet all humans perceive these. 
Thinking that this might be cultur-
ally mediated, scientists traveled 
the world looking for different 
groupings of wavelength in differ-
ent cultures. They discovered that 
with slight differences, almost all 
cultures group color the same way. 
Something inside our minds shapes 
and simplifies the world of color, 
drawing sharp lines between red 
and orange where no such line 
exists. It's possible 
that we have the 
same inher-
