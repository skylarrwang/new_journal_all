Monkey Business 
FEW PEOPLE TODAY WOULD CLAIM 1HAT 
humans consistently make rational decisions. 
But this is exactly what traditional economics 
has assumed for over a hundred years. As a 
result, economists have ·long been unable to 
account for many of the irrational choices 
that people make. At the Capuchin Cognition 
Lab at Yale, a team of researchers led by Yale 
economist Keith Chen, is using monkeys to · 
expand the field's understanding of human 
behavior. They are attempting· to show that 
many of our irrational decisions are not just 
random deviations, but innate and encoded 
through evolution 
as tools for survival. 
Their first 
was the fanciful-sound-
ing job of teaching monkeys to use money. 
Capuchin monkeys are about the size of a 
dachshund They get their naine from the 
patch of black hair growing at the back of 
their head, which looks like a skullcap, or 
capuce in French. Eight capuchins live together 
at the lab in a large communal enclosure. Each 
is named after a James Bond character. 
There's Jill Masterson, Mayday, Holly 
Goodhead, Felix Leiter, Goldfinger, Nick 
Nack, and James Bond himsel£ Holly recent-
ly gave bird1 to the lab's newest addition, 
HugoDrax. 
The monkeys were given tokens to 
ex1 
for grapes, Jell-0, and bits of apple. 
But they soon became quite adept at using 
money in other siruations as well. ''Frequently 
you are deceived or bested by the monkeys;'

research 
assistant 
Venkat . 
I .akshminarayanan. According to David 
6 
Leiberman, an undergraduate who works at 
the lab, he has had to pay the monkeys to 
return tools he's accidentally dropped into 
their cage. They've been known to steal 
tokens from all but the most · · 
t experi-
menters. A recent New York Times article even 
reported an incident in which one monkey 
:!d money for sex, something that 
uni.ln. 
dismisses as a rumor. 
One common irrational behavior that . 
researchers have identified is "loss aversion." 
Loss aversion refers to the fact that we have a 
stronger desire to avoid a loss than to achieve 
a gain. Humans have been shown to be more . 
to avoid losing money we ahl:ady own 
than to obtain the same amount of money if 
it's not yet ours. According to Leiberman, '~ 
matter of word choice can dramatically alter 
people's decisions." How an option is present-
'ed can have an even stronger effect than its 
statistical merit. Loss averson poses a chal-
lenge to one of the most basic tenets of tra-
ditional economics: that we make rational 
choices based on predicted outcomes. 
Dr. Ch~n turned to monkeys to find .out 
whether our loss aversion was culttirally 
instilled or innate. Because monkeys have no 
prior experience with currency, the assump-
tion is that if they also show loss aversion, it 
must be genetic. The researchers gave each 
monkey 12 tokens and let them choose 
between "paying" one of· two 
· enters. 
The first experimenter displayed one apple 
cube. If paid, half the tim~ he would give the 
monkey one cube, the other half he would 
give it two cubes. The second experimenter 
displayed two cubes and, when paid, half the 
time would only give the monkey one cube, 
and the other half would give it two. In both 
cases, the monkey had an equal chance of 
receiving two cubes, but in the first scenario it 
appeared that a cube was being added, and the 
second that a. cube was being taken away. 
rnelelmingly the monkeys chose the first 
gamble. Like humans, monkeys have a 
stronger desire to avoid loss rather than to 
achieve gain, a finding which reveals loss aver-
sion to be innate. 
at the Capuchin 
Cognition Lab now think it could carry some 
sort of evolutionary advantage, although 
what that advantage might be is still unclear. 
Dr. Che•a and his team work in the new 
field of behavioral economics, which uses 
math to predict how people behave. But as 
Lakshminarayan 
it, 
his 
hands out to show the distance between the 
two, "You have a lxxly of math here and the 
world here." In traditional, neoclassical eco-
nomics, "to bring the two together you have 
to assume away all factors of a person's 
behavior until they're rational." By bringing 
psychology to the study of economics, one of 
the goals of behavioral economics is to map 
· out the irrational tendencies that lie outside of 
economics' understanding of human behav .. 
ior. He says, "If everyone shares a different 
preference from what economics predicts, 
then it's no longer just a blip on the radar." !t 
becomes a systematic deviation that ean be 
understood, predicted, and even ha messed. 
, •. : 
The fact that we're 
for loss aver-
sion helps explain the appeal of something 
like Bush's tax cuts. .By portraying the cuts as 
a way of allowing Americans to hold onto 
money that would otherwise have been taken 
away, Republicans tap into our primordial fear 
of loss. Behavioral economics tells us that the 
. logical rebuttal 
saying taxes ultimately bene-
fit citizens in the form of federal p 
can't compete. People are naturally more 
motivated by the fear of loss. 
Understanding why we make irrational 
choices can help us to make better decisions 
in the future. "Now that I'm aware of loss 
aversion;' 
said, ''I notice 
myself falling into it like constandy."
