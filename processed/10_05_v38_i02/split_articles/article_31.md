my whole life doing theater. Do you think I knew anything about busi-
ness consulting? For my latest project, .we were hired by a Mexican

believe that? I'm getting paid ( 
to sell beer:. So they send me

I was an art history major at Yale with a focus on fashion. Do you 
think I knew anyd•ing about business consulting? You know they have 
those things with credit car 
ss promotions? You know, with like 
airlines or department stores? Well, I'm working with a major credit 
card company that wants to attract more companies to do promotions 
with them. I'm jetting around the country, 
to CEOs of differ-
ent companies, trying to figure out what makes them pick different 
credit cards, what kind of deals we can offer them, why they go to our 
competitors, important things like that And this is only my first case. 
Here, take a· BCG deck of cards.

I knew anything about business 
consulting? Everybody in the music industry is trying to fig-
ure out how to cash in on this digital music craze, how the record 
labels can actual1y make money off of it The latest idea is..product 
bundles 
what we can package with the usual album's worth of 
music to convince people to pay for the. CD when they can just 
download it for free. So we were hired by a major record label to look 
into the market trends. Why does a BowWow CD packaged with 
three exclusive tracks and two music videos sell less than a Black 
Eyed Peas CD packaged with only one music video? Is it just the rel-
ative popularity of the artists, or is there something else going on 
here? I get to talk to a lot of industry experts, work through focus 
group reports, and consumer habit ttackers. It's actuaUy a lot of fun. 
Here, take a Bain botde opener.
