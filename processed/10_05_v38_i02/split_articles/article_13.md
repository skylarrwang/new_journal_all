BEGIN AT YORK STREET AND BROADWAY 
in front of Off-Broadway Theater. Head 
down York and y~:m'll hit the University 
Theater. Take a left on Chapel and you'll 
pass the Yale Rep. If at this point you 
haven't quenched your _theatrical thirst, 
turn right on College towards the Shubert, 
then continue on the highway to Long 
Wharf. If New Haven's colony of theaters 
were the finches of the Galapagos Islands, 
the length and slope of their beaks would 
determine their chances for survivaL But 
the success of a theater's niche actually 
depends on such non-biological factors as 
ticket prices, facilities, and show bookings. 
One case study in this process of natural 
selection is the Shubert Theater. · 

Founded in 1914, the Shubert made its 
name with old-Hollywood glamour and 
grandeur. Originally a "try-out house" for 
shows headed to Broadway, the Shubert's 
brochure lauds it as the "Birthplace of the 
N arion's Greatest Hits," as well as . the 
stage that launched "many of the world's 
best and most popular actors." These sue~ 
cesses 
reasons for the Shubert to puff 
up its breast and preen its feathers-
include lv[y Fair Lacfy, A Streetcar Named 
Desire and stars like Marlon Brando and 
Katharine Hepburn that graced the stage. 
In a crowning acknowledgment of the 
Shubert's preeminence in the theater 
world, it was featured in the 19 50 cult 
movie All About Eve. But despite its gilded 
reputation 
and apparent Darwinian fit-
ness 
the theater was forced to close due 
to financial difficulties in the seventies. 

Rather than mourn the passing of its glory 
days, the Shubert reopened its renovated 
doors in 1984 with a fresh focus. This . 
time, the Shubert sought to adapt itself · 
into a socially ambitious, non-profit organ-
ization centered on the goal of providing 
greater theater access for the New 
Haven community. 

In 2001, the Shubert teamed with 
CAPA (Connecticut Association for the 
Performing Arts), a larger non-profit the-
ater organization with a branch in 
Columbus, Ohio. According to Anthony 
Lupinacci,_ the Shubert's Director . of 
Public Relations, "the transition was a pos-
itive one" thanks to the "larger buying 
power" CAPA provides. In the past four 
years, this financial support has been pri-
marily channeled into a broad range of 
programming tailored to the varied popu-
lation of New Haven. These choices range 
from popular musicals such as Rent'--
aimed at the University audience and mak-
ing a much-anticipated return in March-
to a set of shows intended to draw the 
Hispanic community. The "Caliente 
Series," includes Spanish-language con-
certs by artists such as Juanes and Yerba 
Buena as well as performances by the 
high-profile 
dance 
company 
Ballet 
Hispanico. 

Today, the Shubert's ticket prices are 
' arguably its most attractive feature. A 
Theatre Royal Bath production of As You 
Like It, a performance by the Connecticut 
Gay Men's Chorus, or an appearance by 
humorist David Sedaris can be viewed for 
the price of a movie ticket (plus pop-
corn) 
just $15 
but better seats, however 
can cost a more daunting $72. For some 
New Haveners, tickets are free. S.N.A.P. 
(Shubert Night at a Performance) distrib-
utes a yearly total of 700 theater tickets to 
senior citizens and families who would oth-
erwise be unable to attend a performance; 
while later this year, a Student Rush dis-
count will guarantee students half-price 
tickets two hours before a show. Another 
noteworthy community program entitled· 
Movin' 2 organizes workshops led by artists 
from the famed Pilobolus Dance Theatre 
Company for New Haven public schools. 

Since its reopening, the Shubert has 
not been preoccupied with trying to be the 
alpha theater. Last year, a joint venture 
entitled ''All New Haven's a Stage" merged 
the resources of the Shubert, Long Wharf, 
and Yale Rep to bring an abundance of 
Shakespeare performances to the city. 
Each theater presented a Shakespearean 
show during the season, while combined 
advertising and discounted ticket packages 
encouraged residents to enjoy the produc-
tions in any combination. 

Though the Shubert seems to have 
overcome its struggle with other New 
Haven theaters, it is now confronted with 
a new challenge specific to non-profit 
organizations 
a constant scramble for 
both individual and corporate funding. 
While the Shubert enjoys many loyal con-
tributors, Lupinacci admits that it is "a 
challenge each year to keep these corpora-
tions on board and to grow." 

No matter which niche the Shubert 
Theater nestles into, the other finches will 
be nipping at its f~athers. But as it contin-
ues to secure its nest, the Shubert's beak is 
long and gracefully curved.
