ON SATURDAY, AMIDST TilE MADNESS OF 1HE 
first week of school, I convinced myself and 
my roommates to make the arduous· journey 
to IKEA (Yes, we thought we needed lamps 
called ''Attarp" and coffee tables called 
''Bankesta.") As we stumbled into the palatial 
store, we glanced at each other and cringed. 
Customers swarmed, descending upon 
IKEA as if it were the Dome of the Rock. 
IKEA devotees and the uninitiated alike pros-
trated themselves before the furniture, then 
embarked on a pi1gt image through a 
labyrinthine course that began at the "market-
place" and ended at the ''warehouse." Along 
the way, IKEA displayed 
floor 
models of their products like the icons in 
monasteries of Late Antiquity. Consumers are 
encouraged to examine the items in the 
rooms, wandering a preordained . course 
marked by large yellow and blue arrows com-
manding: "Goeth this way' or "Suffereth the 
penalty of degradation and the wrath of fire 
alarms." I was appalled by this new ortho-
doxy of consumerism. As the dizzying course 
snaked through the mammoth store, a land-
mark of blue and yellow Swedish pride, con-
verts became (somehow) even more chaotic 
and crazed. In the gruesome inner battle over 
marginal cost vs. marginal utility, the tension 
between a tight budget and a "vital" item, with 
each object they added to their carts, they

seemed to bubble and tWitch. 
In order to gain temporary repose from 
the mass of consumers, I ducked into -a floor 
model that was slightly less packed than the 
others. I collapsed onto a black, cushioned 
couch in one of the rooms and was taken 
aback by how comfortable it was; I thought 
that perhaps I was the idiot for not joining the 
throng and p 
in the gospel. My gaze 
strayed from the flocks meandering by a 
bookshelf on my left I remarked to myself 
that it was an exquisite piece of furniture, one 
that I would very much like to purchase. But 
what struck me most was not the really cheap 
price but the books that IKEA displayed on 
that bookshel£ My gaze remained transfixed 
by a book with a glaring red cover, procJajrn-
ing in bold white letters, Gift Med ·En 
Kommunist, the Swedish translation of a title by 
Philip Roth. I scanned the rest of the book-
shelf, which contained tomes with tides such 
as, Mina tolv politiska ar: Fragmen~ minnesbi/derj 
drommar by Claes Anderson and Hjalmar 
Bergman's Herr von Hanck.en. 
I could only 
guess what those titles meant All the books 
on the shelf seemed political in nature, and I 
wondered what subtle, subliminal message 
IKEA was attempting to send. 
Feigning interest in· the bookshelf, I sig-
naled an IKEA employee to assist me. I 
pointed to some features of the bookshelf 
and asked him to explajn them. Then, as he 
joylessly elaborated on the sturdiness of this 
bookshelf and the quality of the wood, I 
intern;tpted him and pointed to the red book 
shouting the inscription Gift Med En 
Kommunist and asked him to delineate the 
meaning. The employee shrugged and 
responded flatly, ''Must have something to do 
with Communism." I pressed him further, 
asking why IKEA :was displaying political 
commentary on her bookshelves. The 
employee 
clearly unversed in his temple's 
secrets 
shrugged as if I had spoken in 
Swedish and answered, "How should I 
know?" 
So I did some research and inspected the 
rest of the floor models. All of the rooms 
with bookshelves contained books with polit-
ical subject matter, and the holy trinity of 
IKEA was Philip Roth, Theodor Kamfatides, 
and Claes Andersson. Back at school, as if 
possessed, 
I found that Gift Med En 
Kommunist is, in English, Roth's I Married a 
Communist. Written in 1998, it conveys the 
ambiance of late 1940s cominunism in 
America. Andersson, a distinguished Permo-
Swedish writer and psychiatrist, belongs to the 
People's Party of Finland; Kallifatides is a 
Greek philosopher whose views straddle 
postmoden•ism and communism. 
Was there a subliminal message here? I 
called IKEA and asked to speak to the gener-
al manager. After bobbing my head ad nause-
um to the bass beat of the muzak, I ended up
