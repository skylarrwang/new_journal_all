grouchiness, rh.ooc} s,.Vings, irri-

tability, and sort}etifue"s unpleas-
ant personality as byproducts 
of teen angst. Twenty is a road 
marker, one that essentially 
reads: "Hey Kid, You've Got 
One Year Before You Can 
Drink and Two Before You're 
Thrown out on Your Ass into 
the Real World." It's been 
almost two months since I left 
my summer internship, two 
weeks since I should have start-
ed applying for jobs for next 
summer, and it'll be another 
three before I get on the ball 
and update my resume. In two 
years, Yale will toss me out, 
diploma in hand, and I'll have 
to find a job, a home, and 
maybe a cat. Unless I turn out to be 
a statistical abnormality, I will be 
married in five years, have at least 
one child shortly thereafter (or 
shortly before, perhaps rnotivating 
said marriage), and pass through 8.6 
jobs by the time I'm 32. In other 
words, I have to prepare myself 
for adulthood. 

Apparently I'm not alone in rny 
anxiety about the future. Five years 
September 2005 
after the climax of teen angst (15) 
and fifteen years before the oft-cin-
ematized mid-life crisis ( 40), a feel-
ing of dread assaults most twen-
tysomethings. Although the senti-
ment has only been recently identi-
fied, it has become widespread 
enough to warrant its own label: 
The Quarterlife Crisis. A couple of 
weeks ago, I wandered into the Self-
Help section at Barnes and Noble 
and discovered that the affliction 
has even generated literature: a slitn, 
stop-sign red volume by Yale alum-
na Alexandra Robbins promising 
help. I flipped through, read the 
blurb on the back, and bought it. 
While I still have a couple of years. 
to go before I enter "quarterlife" 
·territory, pre-emptive strikes are a 
trend these days and I figured I 
might need to know what I was in 
for. As I walked to the register, I 
couldn't help noticing the book's 
subtitle: Advice from Twenrysomethings 
Who Have Been There and 
Survived.

to die. 

The term "Quarterlife 
Crisis" entered the cultural 
lexicon 
in . 2001 
Rob bins, prior to publishing 
Secrets of the Tomb and Pledged, 
co-authored Quarterlife Crisis. 
The book was a national 
bestseller, spawning numer-
ous 
imitations 
Robbins' 
website bills Quarterlife Crisis 
as "The Official Book" and 
Conquering 
Your Quarterlife 
Crisis 
as 
"The 
Official 
Sequel." I 
was 15 when 
Quarterlife Crisis was pub-
lished, · so it's not surprising 
that it slipped under my radar. But, 
given the success of the Prozac 
Nation genre in the late nineties, it 
seems only natural that a wave of 
self-help books aimed at healing 
Nation's author Elizabeth Wurtzel 
and her cronies has followed. 

Luckily, Robbins' sumtnary of 
Quarterlife Crisis in the introduction 
to the sequel eliminates the need to 
read it, let alone buy it. According 
41 


to Robbins, "the Quarterlife Crisis 
is a response to reaching a turning 
point in life 
in this case, the tran-
sition between young adulthood and 
adulthood." She immediately notes 
that it can manifest itself in an 
·almost infinite number of ways, but 
provides a helpful checklist geared 
at self-diagnosis: 

* You don't know what you want. 
* Your 20s aren:t what you expected. 
* You have a fear of failure. 
* You can't let go of your childhood. 
* You waffle over decisions. 
* You constantly compare yourself 
to others. 

Presumably 
Quarterlife 
wasn't this con-
cise, but it did 
stop 
short 
of 
offering concrete 
tips for overcom-
ing these obsta-
cles. 
Robbins 
admits that the 
lack of advice in 
" 
was an egregtous 
omission," 
and 
claims 
that

And even though the purpose of 
these opening vignettes is solely to 
provide context for the advice that

in. This isn't a book about how to

it's about dealing with 
daily minutae. Who can't feel a

"dread[s] Sunday nights because 
they mean Monday morning is only 
a pillow away"? And Kelly's account 
of her home-life is undeniably dis-
mal: "I have a cat who I talk to all

some of the· tes- .

Let's analyze the structure of

"Hopes and

tion begins with the story of

Robbins, it seems, is a proponent 
of the "break 'em down, then build 
'em back up" mentality conunonly 
used in n1ilitary boot camps. Each 
chapter of the book follows a for-
mula, beginning with a series of tes-
timonials by agonized twentysome-

from their better-adjusted peers.
