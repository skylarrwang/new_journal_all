"be the best person you can be." 
But I was unable to link Oprah's 
advice to Laura's eventual success. 
Although I can see how, if Larry · 
became "the best person he could 
be" (i.e., not a chauvinistic pig), he 
might stop regarding women as 
material goods and possibly get 
a date. 

The sage advice from the twen-
tysomethings who have managed to 
get their lives together seems gen-
uinely heartfelt, but I often couldn't 
read it without recalling the empow-
erment speakers who frequented my 
high school. In Robbins' book, 
there's John, w4o says "I wish I'd 
known at 2~ t~at 'you should slow 
• 
down and think about what) impor-
tant."' Only slight_l_y;,U:onic; consider-
, .

"' $'; --. 
down the intersta;te ·at 6ver 100 miles 
per hour, and winding up in a ditch. 

And, in perhaps the book's most 
dramatic testitnonial, after her hus-
band is critically injured in a car acci-
dent, Maria finds herself trans-
formed overnight from newlywed to 
caretaker. Noting that all situations 
that cause stress are "a big deal/' 
Maria tells readers, "It's important to 
free yourself from the preconceived-
notions of what adulthood should 
be. The preconceived ideas are often 
what lead people into a downfall of 
hopes." 

Most of the book's featured 
twentysomethings 
weren't 
faced 
with such dire situations as ditches 
and downfalls, but their advice is 
equally 
vague. 
Regardless 
of 
whether they're commenting on 
work, home, relationships, family, 
friends, hopes, dreams, or the vast 
expanse that is "identity," Robbins' 
surrogate· therapists encourage read-
ers to take risks, readjust world-
views, be open to change, and find 
inner peace. Robbins herself flits in 
and out of the advice segrnents, 
offering "More Ways to Conquer" at 
October 2005 
the end of each chapter, in which .. 
she rehashes the tips she already 
explained. Both Robbins and the 
twentysomethings suggest legitimate 
ways to beat the blues, but . because 
their advice is · so abstract, so one-
size-fits-all, after. a while it begins to 
resemble the "Re-Vamp Your Life!" 
articles that are published, reworked, 
and republished in women's maga-
zines every month. Flipping to the 
back of the book, I noticed that 
Cosmo is listed among Robbins' cred-
its. It all began to make sense. 

I'm honesdy surprised that no 
one found a way to ·mass-market the 
concept of the Quarterlife Crisis 
sooner. But in spite of her claim that 
Conquering Your Quarterlife Crisis is the 
book with all the answers, I found 
its advice so general that it could be 
applicable to almost any unhappy or 
stressed person at any junction in 
life. The only thing Robbins man-
ages to do in the book is establish 
that twentysomethings have issues. 
Duh. She already wrote an entire 
book about that. Ironically, Robbins 
differentiates the Quarterlife Crisis 
from the midlife crisis, saying ''A 
middle age guy might feel his life is 
stagnant, characterized by pre-
dictability, stability, and certainty. At 
25 however, a common feeling :is 
that there's too much unpredictabili-
ty, instability, and uncertainty." But 
both groups benefit from being told 
to _mix it up, try new things, and 
spurn complacency. 

I finished the book more con-
vinced than ever that the first cou-
ple of years out of Yale are going to 
be difficult. But I still had no clue 
what to do about that. Of course, I 
could always just follow Robbins' 
lead and impose my neuroses on 
the masses.
