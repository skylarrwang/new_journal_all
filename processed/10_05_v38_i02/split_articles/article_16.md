**Title: THE NEW JOURNAL**
**Author: Emily Koh**

with each new reader, becomes a 
more successful forum for commu-
nity discussion. 

The site claims to produce a nas-
cent form of journalism: "new 
news." The concept grew out of 
public dissatisfaction with tradition-
al news suppliers, long criticized for 
compromising journalistic ethics 
with their corporate agendas. The 
· site declares that "Power of the 
press now belongs not to those who 
own one, but to those who own a 
modem." 

With this in mind, Bass estab-
lished the Online Journalism Project, 
· which aims to develop online public 
news forums by financing websites 
run by freelancers committed to the 
return of "grassroots· news reporting 
vital to the health of a democracy." 
N ewhavenindependent.org is one 
such . site. Although available to a 
global readership, the site only fea-
tures local news. It's Your Town. ·Read 
Afl About It, is the tagline 
an 
encouragement· to city residents to 
keep tabs on what's happening in 
their backyard. 

Bass claims one of the site's 
objectives is to "c~>nnect the political 
landscape to the neighborhood." In 
an article entitled "Chen vs. The 
Machine, II," Bass covered the 
Democratic Primary for Alderman 
in Ward 2. The race between incum-
bent Joyce Chen and Gina Calder 
proved a contentious subject, pro-
voking a spirited online dialogue. Ed 
Mattison, an "aldermanic collegue" 
(sic) of Chen, was critical of her 
political record and did not support 
her re-election. He wrote, "I have 
always regarded [Bass's] enthusiam 
(sic) for [Chen] as an astonishing 
fantasy. The notion that she is some 
kind of reformer is absurd. 
How 
can she be a reformer when she 
doesn't show up at our meetings a 
good percentage of 
the 
time. 
Although she is a perfectly nice per-
son, I cannot remember once having 
a 
substantive conversation with 
her ... It isn't enough to talk about 
reform, it is necessary to do some-
thing about it." 

In response to this post; "true-
bluect" commended Chen, a former 
Green Party Member, for shaking up 
New Haven's staunchly Democratic 
political climate: "In the face of the 
Mayor's hegemony, who could hope 
that Joyce would make a real differ-
ence, except as bearing witness 
against those who have sold their 
souls ... Mr. Mattison can take his 
smear 
campaign 
and 
pray 
for 
Absolution. The one Party system is 
the problem, and God Bless all those 
who stand against it. Joyce Chen may 
be imperfect, but at least she is inde-
pendent of the power structure that 
chokes New Haven. What has Ed 
done for the people of New Haven 
(except hold the Mayor's cloak)." 

Such dialogue is missing from big 
media, but. is just what can be found 
in the much more .intimate "new 
news." Giving power of expression 
to the community removes th~ cor-· 
porate scrim between the public and 
the issues that impact them. In a ':::-
cover story for The New Haven · 
Advocate in early September, Bass 
wrote, "Local turf is too small for 
the media behemoths ... Yet local turf 
represents the future of American 
journalism, and of American civic 
society. Local journalism connects 
most directly to readers. It has the 
most potential to involve people in 
their communities and in the issues 
that affect their lives." 

A resident of New Haven since 
1978, Bass knows the city well. His 
brainchild should guarantee that 
anyone with "a computer, a modem, 
and talent" can get to know New 
Haven and help to shape it. In bring-
ing 
local 
politics 
to 
desktops 
throughout the city, Bass hopes to 
reignite civic interest, which places 
even more emphasis on the site's sin-
gle requirement. The site defines its 
intended audience as: "New Haven. 
Its neighborhoods. Its government. 
Its people 
from the knuckleheads 
to the dreamers and schemers, and 
everyone in between." He's talking 
about you.
