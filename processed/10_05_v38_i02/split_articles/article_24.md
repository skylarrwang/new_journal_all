evening. 
Pedestrians whisk past the windows 
at digitally enhanced speeds. Silhouette of a twen-
ty-year-old female reporter seated at a table close 
to the glass wearing a fiendish red boa. She stares 
intently at the swiftly moving traffic, watching as 
she waits. Sound effect (SFX): a whining vacu-
um and faint muzak. 

Voiceover (VO)-Young female 
reporter 
"My editor said this would be a 
break-through story. He said 'Hey kiddo, 
this is a big one. If it was a car, I'm seeing 
a Studebaker with a chrome grill, 
wingtips. I'm seeing 
you in the driver's 
seat, full throttle' and 
then he punched the 
desk with his fist, 'That's 
makin' a day-old frappe 
a joe. This is a story 
about real life in 
photo frames. 
Cinematography, 
Kino-eye, whatever. 
I'm looking for gothic 
precipices, stressy stu-
dents, cookie-cutter 
college kids trying to 
set the scene. He says 
film at Yale is on the verge 
about to bubble 
over, a spillover into a golden age. I'm 
seeing stars. Now here I am, Au Bon Pain 
and I'm waiting for my first lead. His 
name's Adam Davenport, cool kid, cool 
as a cucumber. As a freshman, first year 
on the lot, he founded Bulldog 
Productions, Yale's first serious inde-
pendent film production company. It all 
started with a grant, a Sudler fund, 
and a short film he directed. You can just see 
him in the here, yelling 'That's a wrap.' 
Four years later, his baby is UOPF-fund-
ed -with an executive board, forty active 
members, and a zany average of two very 
hoopla films each semester. But his great-
est achievement at Yale may be one he's 
working on right now."

slender fingers. He shifts in his chair as if all eyes 
are on him. 

Cut to Closeup (CU)

Yale Law School Auditorium. 
Sofia is wearing a green man-tailored shirt 
and jeans, posture as casual as her clothes. 
"Just go out and start making movies 
that you're into."

Prism shot of Adam 
Superimposed over a shot of Adam typing a 
screenplay called Midnight Sun, we see the text 
of a letter naming him the recipient of the 
Panavision 
New 
FilmMaker 
Award, a grant 
that will cover the 
cost of camera 
equipment to pro-
duce a 35 millime-
ter film.

"Midnight Sun is the culmina-
tion of my film 
endeavors at Yale, 
a 15 minute film on 35 millimeter; it's a charac-
ter study of a New England college pro-
fessor who leaves his wife to meet some-
one from the Internet." 

The young reporter smiles and fluffs her boa. 
"I don't have the means to attend film 
school, so I said to myself, 'I'll make a 
film on 35 millimeter and use it as a call-
ing card for a career.' I'm so terrified by all 
this because I don't think 35 millimeter 
has been done before at Yale, but it's all 
the more reason to go for it. 

"I hope to get it to Sundance. I'm 
working with Clint Eastwood's cine-
matographer, Tom Stern. He did Million 
Dollar Baby. 

"Yesterday I got an email from 
Julianne Moore's manager." 

Starstruck, the young reporter imagines her-
self on the party beat for The LA Times.
