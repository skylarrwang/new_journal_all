Shmo? 
continued from page 2 
could be put together out of all these vir-
tuosi. Dancing lessons used to be almost 
as popular as musical instruction in the 
suburbs of the 1950s, so our chorus line 
will form itself. As for our actors, anyone 
who has undergone a departmental tea 
knows that graduate students surely can 
play a role. 

I grow lyrical whenever I muse about 
what will happen the first night the grad 
revue is produced. There is no limit to the 
disasters that might befall us and keep our 
tongues wagging for years. The avant-
garde set which someone will surely design 
might collapse. The band is likely to quit 
midway through the first act, claiming that 
their musical integrity is compromised by 
the hams on the stage. And there is no 
doubt that the unfortunate actors will fail 
to make old saws the writers provide them 
with sing like violins. 

If the grad revue will be such a botch, 
what purpose will it serve other than to 
give its crew an image of the kind of good 
time they think they had when they were 
ten? I submit that even a brief and frivo-
lous excursion into the "creative" arts will 
stop their g.Pb prattle about how easy it is 
to be both whimsical and serious at the 
same time. Who knows, it might give them 
some respect for the artist's work and an 
appreciation of their own worth as critics. 
It might even make them see that there is 
more bitter truth than bad poetry ih the 
lines by Aristotle I had to Jearn while a 
freshman: 
The middle class within the state fares best, 
/ween 
May I be neither low nor great, but e'en 
between.

**Wretched excess**
**Author: Leo Ribuffo**

Mr. Ribuffo replies: 
Gee, Bob, I've always wanted to have one 
of these withering exchanges in a ritzy 
intellectual magazine, and now you've 
given me the chance. If this were the New 
Masses thirty years ago, I could denounce 
you as a Trotskyite revisionist traitor to 
the "nice" revolution in graduate school 
(with my own eyes I have seen books by 
Isaac Deutscher in your apartment) and 
be done with it; but these days, withering 
exchanges must take a more subdued 
form. Since you've opened with the whim-
sically erudite style of the New York Re-
view of Books, combining equal parts 
charm and in-group allusion, I'll reply in 
kind. 

To begin, I must admit a possible error 
in my essay. A local AI Capp scholar has 
informed me that the furry creature I 
had in mind was not the schmoo at all, but 
the "kick-me." I am trying to confirm this 
correction, but the only doctoral disserta-
tion on Capp (in American studies at 
Oregon) has not yet arrived from Uni-
versity Microfilms: A Xerox Company, 
Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48106. In the mean 
time, however, let me express willingness 
to assist you in preparing the libretto for 
your grad-school revue. Although we are 
not at Northwestern, a quick walking tour 
of L & B will provide enough buxom 
honeys to fill out the chorus line. I am 
aware of the Plymouth Rock project, and 
I am willing to contribute a score entitled, 
" I Can't Get No Sanctification." Jf, how-
ever, you decide to write the great chroni-
cle about the drop-out "who becomes in 
turn a dentist, lawyer and novelist while 
living in a forest and destroying his mind 
by blowing the oboe," I cannot be of much 
help. Alas, my stylistic roots barely reach 
to Nathanael West. But you, Bob, the 
grand connoisseur of Thomas Mann, can 
produce a grad school epic. Could not 
H GS be the Magic Mountain? 

OK, so much for whimsy; now for some 
seriousness. Perhaps my article sounded 
too self-righteous, and you have put me 
in my place for my smugness. Neverthe-
less, I still believe that my description of 
the atmosphere in graduate school is es-
sentially valid. I never said that "most of 
these poor wretches" could "blossom" into 
anything. I don't really know. Rather, I 
argued that most graduate students don't 
consider doing anything other than their 
current "scholarship"; nor do they reflect 
on why they are doing that. The excep-
tions often go off to be novelists or forest 
rangers (you know and respect the two 
men I have in mind), and some of us wal-
low in survival guilt when they leave. 

This past week, 1 sampled responses to 
my article, and I have found evidence fully 
to confirm my arguments. For every per-
son who appreciated the attempted wit, 
whether or not he agreed with me, there 
was at least one other who complained 
that 1 wasn't adequately serious, that my 
tone wasn't scholarly enough, that I didn't 
offer "positive programs" for reform. I 
have always known that there are folks 
who read "The Wasteland" and mutter 
that Eliot should have written a statistical 
study of suicides in London, but I didn't 
expect that kind of mentality to be so 
widespread--even in grad school. Shall 
I make up an annotated reading list of 
Swift and Veblen to show that serious 
points can be made-sometimes must be 
made-by satire and ridicule? Or shall I 
polish my seminar-paper prose, drop 
allusions to Mannheim and David Ries-
man, and point to the Ph.D.s in 1910 who 
"improved" Emily Dickinson's poetry by 
making it rhyme; the Ph.D.s of 1920 who 
lavished praises on Howells and never 
read M oby Dick; the Ph.D.s of 1933 who 
explained that one must not tamper with 
the business cycle? This comment, un-
fortunately, is not the place to offer his-
torical evidence of the too frequent 
narrowness and overconfidence of aca-
demic men, characteristics which survive 
well into our generation. 1 can only suggest 
that we note with Emerson-who was 
barred for twenty years from Harvard-
that there is an important difference be-
tween "Man Thinking" and "the parrot of 
other men's thinking," and that we should 
try to be the former.

**Balcony**
**Author: Paul Bennett**

Balcony 
The Yale Dramat's tear-it-yourself poster 
made their recent production of Genet's 
The Balcony probably their best-publicized 
production in years. It is sad that the origi-
nality of the poster was not matched by the 
originality and effectiveness of the per-
formance, any more than their ambitious-
ness in choosing The Balcony was matched 
by their ability to do justice to the imagi-
nation of the playwright. Genet's script 
has as many flaws as it has openings into 
the depths of human nature, and the 
Dramat production clearly came from a 
director and a company who were as hesi-
tant to acknowledge the shortcomings as 
they were to plunge into the possibilities. 
Perhaps "shortcomings" is the wrong 
word, because everything in the play is 
very long in coming. This, first of all, the 
Dramat did not face up to. Judicious cut-
ting and considerably more attention to the 
pace of the first scenes might have over-
come in part Genet's wordiness. 

But if Genet wrote a wordy play, he also 
wrote a rich one, and the Dramat company 
continuaJly failed to convey the deep 
humanness inherent in the perverted fan-
tasies of the Grand Balcony brothel. 

Genet's characters are caricatures of 
human nature, but they are valid carica-
tures, reflecting much that we don't like 
to admit about ourselves. This production 
treated them as ludicrous without convey-
ing the closeness of their fantasies to what 
all of us dream about. The morbidity of 
the "visitors' "fantasies was emphasized 
instead of their delight, and the result was 
an image uniformly dark and heavy where 
it should have had many sparks of light. 
(The Yale Daily News's somewhat fawn-
ing review claimed that the humor "came 
through with great comic effect," but I 
don't recall a single solid laugh from the 
near-capacity house that sat through the 
show with me.) If there had been some 
delight in the activities of the brothels, 
some evidence that the fantasies were not 
chores but pleasures, there would have 
been much more compelling force to 
Genet's perverted images of human nature. 

Time helps to erase the impression of 
monotony from my mind and in this per-
spective it is easier to see what the produc-
tion might have been. Above all, there was 
a fine sense of style in the visual aspect of 
the production. The set was complex and 
interesting, though its extreme clumsiness 
disqualifies it from being, in the words of 
the News review, "a theatrical marvel." 
No set that monopolizes so much of the 
running time can be called marvelous or 
theatrical. 

Just as the set was well-conceived but 
ineffectual in operation, the acting style of · 
the show had considerable potential but 
did not tit the needs of the company. The 
problem was most acute for the most 
stylized characters, the male-<:ast Madame 
Irma and Carmen. Limited by the masks 
they wore, they had to rise into a different 
level of stylization from the rest of the 
play, and though Dean Pickford as Car-
men managed to come through with a 
remarkably subtle and convincing per-
formance, Jeff Pressman in the central and 
difficult role of Madame Irma all too often 
lost contact with the other characters and 
turned conversation into soliloquy. This 
was the fate of the first-a.ct scene between 
Irma and Carmen, a scene well designed 
and directed in all the externals but Jacking 
the essential interaction between char-
acters. 

Though Charles Maryan's direction of 
The Balcony showed a skill in the manipu-
lation of style that might have produced a 
striking production with more experienced 
actors, he has failed once more, as he did 
in The H ostage, to fill the particular re-
quirements for the director of the Yale 
Dramat. However much the Yale Dramat 
may have accomplished, it is an amateur 
group, and its actors need a director who 
can lead them on to performances far 
beyond what they could do on their own. 
Their needs are special, and almost three 
hours of The Balcony were ample proof 
that it is no kindness to pretend Mr. 
Maryan fills those needs.
