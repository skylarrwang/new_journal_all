Teaching black studies at Yale 
by Austin Clarke 
This is not the first time that I find myself 
teaching-perhaps I should have said, 
trying to teach-white and black students. 
It is, however, the first time I am constantly 
aware that there are white and black stu-
dents in my classes. Obviously, this 
awareness does not come of any great 
erudition on my part. Rather it spririgs 
from a greater awareness which begins out 
there on the streets, in the city streets of 
the ghetto and in the various avenues of 
mind and attitudes. This, after all, is 
America. 

Even though one can, like me, ignore 
with a certain amount of success the 
difference in colour, if that colour is predi-
cated upon some intellectual advantage-
in spite of this, I say that there are mo-
ments when I wonder whether I am not 
more of an image (in the meanest, most 
reprehensible sense of that term) both for 
my white students and my black students. I 
use the personal possessive adjective not 
without great care. I am, after all, much 
more free of prejudices that have to do 
with race than they can possibly ever be. 
And when my awareness of this position in 
which I am held by my students becomes 
clouded by the proximity of the street 
mentality to the classroom mentality, 
then I become extremely depressed and 
wonder whether in the heat of the various 
white and black nationalisms and hatreds, 
the entire idea of education in this country, 
and in this university in particular, is not 
in need of a radical overhauling. 

I do not intend to perform this function. 
I have faced myself and have concluded 
that to be a sane writer, a black man with 
a strong conviction of the beauty and truth 
in creative work, is sufficiently hazardous 
and sometimes, in my personal topsy-turvy 
life, sufficiently revolutionary also. 

I dislike greatly the attempt on the part 
of some of my students to tear me limb 
from limb and to presume that they can 
remake me to suit their various radical, 
their various reactionary specifications. It 
is equally obscene of them to imagine 
that apart from basicaJly different views 
of black literature, their approach to intel-
lectual analysis of their views can effec-
tively be couched in the afterbirth of their 
radical hangups. 

Now, I am not making a judgement 
upon the validity of the various brands of 
nationalism one faces here at Yale. I am 
merely stating that education in itself 
cannot be circumscribed by racial pref-
erences and racial resentments: education 
after all is not a prerogative of whiteness 
-or even of blackness-although it is 
understood that one group has laid some 
sort of foundation which is not today 
totally binding, as far as either its applica-
tion or its applicability. 

In the classroom I have found two basic 
reactions to the course which I gave last 
semester in black literature. Ironically 
and, for some, startlingly, these reactions 
were shared by the black students as well 
as the white students. The first reaction was 
an almost non-serious approach to the 
studies. Black literature after all, as far as 
so-called established critical judgements 
go, is the bastard discipline, if most regard 
it as a discipline at all. Students were 
reflecting this traditional attitude; and the 
irony lay in the acceptance by some black 
students of this attitude. This was done in 
spite of the revolutionary consciousness 
Austin C. Clarke, lecturer on black litera-
ture in the 20th century, is a visiting 
professor in the American studies and 
English departments at Yale. 
which some display in the whole area of 
college education. 

The second reaction was, apart from 
the sceptical approach, a seriousness ex-
pressed for the studies by both black and 
white st_udents, with such a refreshing 
warmth that it shattered certain miscon-
ceptions and crystallized others. 

I think that the security and what is 
called the "relevancy" of the courses on 
the university curriculum has a greater sig-
nificance than the cutting of the classes. 
For it means that real freedom is being 
experienced. Why should a black student 
have to attend a lecture merely because 
it is in black literature? And if the answer 
to this question proves difficult--or 
even if it seems nonsensical to pose the 
question, perhaps I should add that the 
"relevancy" of the course lies not so much 
in its being attended by the black students 
as in its availability in an academic com-
munity which most black students-if not 
in fact all-regard with a profound fore-
boding. 

In some cases, Yale presents a distinctly 
hostile environment to these black stu-
dents. Apart from their participation in 
such courses, by their attendance, their 
feeling seems to be one of achievement that 
the institution has been made "relevant" 
by its rather belated recognition of a 
precious slice of an experience, which on 
the one hand is accepted as having con-
tributed to the total experience of the 
country and which on the other is not 
recognized as worthy of study. Sometimes 
I get the feeling that to "elevate" black 
studies to a discipline in the same way as 
Slavonic Studies is regarded here as a 
legitimate academic discipline-whatever 
that term, "discipline·· means-is tanta-
mount to elevating the people whom that 
experience is concerned with: and this 
is taken to be racially unacceptable. 

For how can you regard seriously such 
things as black studies and black history 
-that is to say, the history of the black 
people in this country, if their history can 
be separated from the history of the 
country-how in the name of hell can you 
regard black studies in this way and con-
tinue to regard black people in a less 
serious way? It can't happen. So then it 
ought to pe clear that black studies pro-
grams on the white university curriculum 
are an obvious step toward the radicaliza-
tion of the university itself, and, in turn, of 
society. 

This brings us to what might be termed 
the heart in the problem of approaches to 
black studies: the intention of such a 
course. Is the intention merely to present 
the black experience to the rest of the 
society, in a vindictive, blind fashion of 
racial retribution? Is it to present this black 
experience only to the black section of the 
society, that section not being concerned 
that whites are present during this kind 
of instruction? Or is to present this black 
experience in the hope that it clarifies 
certain racial misconceptions held by both 
black and white people? 

One could ask another question: is the 
intention to present this body of black 
"facts'' so that it inculcates into the black 
listeners an intellectual-cultural drug and 
imbues them with a blacker black con-
sciousness of themselves-which con-
sciousness, in the framework of a decidedly 
racist society might perhaps make them 
more revolutionary (or make them com-
mit suicide), in the sense in which Eldridge 
Cleaver and other black intellectuals, like 
Leroi Jones and Ron Karenga, understand 
that term? 

I feel that the intention of the white uni-
versity is contained in its approach to these 
black studies. In some cases, the univer-
sity would only agree to accommodate 
black students' demand for black studies 
if it was felt that refusal might bring out 
some disruption of the university itself. 
The disruption could be real: burning 
down buildings and holding university offi-
cers captive; or academic: cutting classes 
and refusing to write examinations. 

The black studies programme at Yale 
University-which I know best--can be 
said to be functioning to the general satis-
faction of everyone involved. Ironically, it 
came without physical disruption: it essen-
tially was so "intelligently sanguine" that 
Yale has the reputation of being the first 
American university to have black studies 
(the administration caJls it Afro-American 
studies) as a university major. There are 
some doubts, of course-mainly about the 
black literature course given at Yale. The 
underlying political nature of the motiva-
tion for black studies does nothing to aJiay 
suspicions. But the criticism from students 
-black and white-that I have heard 
centers entirely on the question of inade-
quate teaching staff. It is not an ideological 
criticism. 

There is, however, a feeling in some 
quarters that black American literature, 
like black American history, can best be 
taught by a black American. (Can Russian 
literature be taught best by Russians?) 
The definition of "best", if one could be 
forthcoming from these dissident students, 
would perhaps explain the shortcomings 
they saw in a professor who was black, let 
us say, from the Caribbean or from Africa, 
but who was not a black American.In 
that word, "best" lies the inteiJectual 
chauvanism of the American black stu-
dent, who sometimes feels that black 
studies courses could have relevance to 
himself only if they were held in closed, 
homogeneously black circumstances. 

There is also an indication that the con-
tent should be a lower-key "blowing of 
whitey's mind." I do not think that the 
e n
