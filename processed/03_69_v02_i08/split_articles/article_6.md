as a witness against Smith. However, by this 
time, he is too deeply entangled in Under-
world, USA, and he must kill Connors to free 
himself. In the struggle be himself is shot, and 
be dies in the same alley where his father was 
murdered. 

A theme of cleanliness runs through the 
entire film. It starts with Cliff Robertson 
sterilizing instruments in a prison hospital 
and ends when, as he's dying, be stumbles 
over a trashcan which says "Keep Your 
City Cle.an." Why did you use this? 

Again, I wanted contrast. In addition 
to the sterilization of utensils, I told 
Robertson to put the bandages on the 
man very gently, very precisely, like a 
surgeon. I wanted to get that effect: he's 
so clean about those bandages even 
when he's double-crossing the man he's 
putting them on. 

I also tried to get a contrast wherever 
I could between the cleanliness of the 
head of National Projects and the dis-
cussion he's carrying on about narcotics 
and prostitution and murder. I picked 
the swimming pool location for that 
reason. I wanted that hollow, clean 
atmosphere you get around a swim-
ming pool. It's too bad we can't have 
a smell in motion pictures be cause 
there's an antiseptic smell around a 
pool, like in a gym. I thought that the 
cleanest thing in the world is a pool. 
So I had this crime organization hold 
their meetings there, rather than in the 
pompous office or the pool hall or the 
dingy little room where gangsters usu-
ally hang out. I wanted to get that con-
trast to what they're talking about: it's 
so vile and low. 

Why did you depict National Projects, the 
front for Underworld, USA, as such a 
typical business organization, with adding 
machines and bankers and everything? 

It's all done mechanically. lt's almost 
like robots, like computer systems. As 
a matter of fact, I don't doubt that crime 
today is governed by computers. If I 
were to make that picture today, I'd 
show nothing but twenty machines. No 
people, just all the machines. I wanted 
to get that flavor of mechanization in 
the picture. 

It seemed that crime was defined in the film 
as lack of emotion. U nderworld, USA, was 
lack of emotion. 

Yes. And also a facade of good citizen-
ship. Remember that Boss Connors said: 
"We'll always win. All we have to do is 
pay a little taxes, go to church, send a 
couple of kids through school, set up 
a few charities on the side. We'll win. 
We always have. We always will." 

Whe n I shot the bookkeeping and the 
adding machines and all that, I tried to 
show the man's hand in the foreground 
hitting the keys very fast. That, to me, 
was Underworld, USA, what he was 
doing: tic-tic-tic-tic bing-bing tic-tic-tic-
tic . ... It never stopped. 

The coldness of the organization is par-
ticularly well reflected in the Richard Rust 
character, the paid killer. He commits his 
murders totally without commitment, 
almost casually. 

Now there's an honest character! That is 
a man who is not a psychotic; there's 
nothing insane about him. He just has a 
job: He certainly isn't interested in 
killing that little kid. There's no ven-
geance in it! There's no emotion in the 
man at all. That's what finally terrorizes 
Robertson-the way Rust says: "We 
have to wipe out this girl. If you do a 
good job, it'll get you in with the boss." 
The only emotion he has is that it will 
get him in with the boss. To knock off 
a g irl means nothing to him. 

I didn't want Rust to do anything that 
deviated from the character of a pro-
fessional killer, except one thing. I told 
him, "When you're getting ready to kill 
somebody, put on your dark glasses; 
then we'll never know whether or not 
you want to see anything, or whether 
or not you're feeling anything." You 
see, I wanted to keep away from emo-
tion. I didn't want a character like in 
the old gangster pictures: he likes his 
mother, he supports his brother, he has 
a little dog, he feeds goldfish. I didn't 
want that. 

Newspapers are present in a lot of your 
films. I particularly liked their use in this 
one. It seemed to me that there was a 
deliberate contrast in the film between 
witnessing the terrifying corruption of 
Underworld, USA, as in the murder of 
the little girl, and then seeing these things 
on the printed page, completely deper-
sonalized. 

Usually, newspapers are overdone in 
movies. But I don't mind showing some-
thing and then showing a contrast of it 
in the press. I feel the same way about 
flashbacks. Unless the flashback has
