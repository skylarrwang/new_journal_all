**Title: George Richmond and "micro-economics"; or if you want a fifth-grader to learn, you might try paying him.**

When George Richmond entered the fifth-
grade classroom where he was to begin his 
teaching career, he was, by his own admission, naive. The school was P.S. 250 in 
Williamsburg, Brooklyn; the students were 
Spanish-speaking inhabitants of a New 
York ghetto; and Richmond, like so many 
young Ivy League intellectuals self-consciously "doing their thing" in inner-city 
schools, was scared. "I found myself in the 
midst of a war not only between student 
and student," he recalls. "Each day cost me 
a year of my life." Richmond saved himself-
and in the process saved a good 
many of his "unsavable" students as well-
by creating perhaps the most radical re-
thinking of urban education methods in 
the last hundred years.


Richmond restructured his classroom 
along the lines of the ghetto values. Marks, 
he reasoned, were a middle-class concept; 
why not replace them with an incentive 
meaningful to lower-class students? That 
incentive was money, and money-in the 
form of a paper scrip system-
became the 
reward for academic performance. Students were paid for high test marks, homework assignments and extra compositions, 
and once a month Richmond's wife supplied baked goods which backed the paper 
money system and were apportioned to 
each class member according to his accumulated wealth. The system, christened 
"micro-economics," worked so well that 
in P.S. 122, the second school Richmond 
tried it in, the reading level of his class of 
inner-city fifth graders rose from a minimum of eight months to four years as 
measured by standardized tests. Money, 
even play money, was real where grades 
never had been.


The system sounds simple, and basically 
it is; yet perhaps only a man like Richmond 
could have created it. Raised on New 
York's Lower East Side, also a slum area, 
Richmond's painting abilities earned him 
admission to the High School of Music and 
Art; he made it to Yale in 1962 ("barely-
I was what they called a risk student") 
after he asked the admissions officer who 
had just reviewed a portfolio of his drawings whether he would like to hear him 
recite a scene from Shakespeare. Before 
the startled interviewer could respond, 
Richmond was into his recitation. He 
ended up with a full scholarship.


Richmond's career here began unevent-
Paul Goldberger, a freshman in Stiles, is a 
contributing editor of The New Journal
fully; he was notable largely for his initial 
dislike of Yale. "I couldn't stand the 
Gothic architecture, the extreme hedonism 
of the place," he says. Then he met Mr. and 
Mrs. Richard Sewall, and the angry young 
artist from the slums began to feel at home. 
Sewall, master of Ezra Stiles College, 
took a liking to Richmond and agreed to 
sponsor some of his artistic work for Yale. 
At first the Sewalls were somewhat shocked-
Richmond had simply walked into the 
brand-new Stiles Master's House to introduce himself "because I liked the architecture." But once they became acquainted, 
Sewall ended up commissioning the 14' x 
14' tapestry that now hangs in the Stiles 
dining hall, a smaller version for the Master's House and some forty murals for the 
rest of the college.


"He was the most cheerful and interesting freshman I'd seen in a long time," 
Sewall now recalls. "We asked him to stay 
for supper, and we lingered for two or 
three hours talking. 'I want to come to 
Ezra Stiles,' he said, 'because you've got a 
lot of blank walls.' " It was Richmond who 
originally suggested the dining-hall tapestry, which filled the Sewalls' basement for 
the entire winter it took to finish. Three 
seamstresses were needed to complete 
Richmond's abstract creation, pieced together with squares of colored cloth to give 
the effect of a mosaic.


The Sewalls' enthusiasm provided the 
start Richmond needed. He held a show of 
drawings in the Stiles buttery and sold 
several works, then continued to replace 
them until, as Sewall says, "We were literally covered by Richmond products." 
Prompted by his sudden success, Richmond went to Italy to try his hand at the 
tapestry business. One of the products of 
his European phase now hangs in an apartment-house lobby in Kenmore Square, 
Boston.


After his graduation from Yale in 1966, 
Richmond set off to Antioch College for 
a session as a Peace Corps trainee. He met 
Jill Orear, a senior at Antioch, and left the 
Peace Corps after a month to marry her. 
He then accepted a position at Antioch 
designing the "Arts in Appalachia" program, then sat back to wait for his wife 
to finish college. That done, the couple set 
off for New York and a summer of the 
city's Intensive Teacher Training Program 
prior to taking on P.S. 250.


Meanwhile, Richmond had been awaiting action on an application for alternative 
service as a conscientious objector. A member of the Society of Friends, he suffered 
through an FBI investigation, a Justice 
Department hearing and two years of waiting before, as he puts it, "they finally 
judged me sincere."


Today Richmond is back in New Haven, 
serving as assistant to the director of the 
Transitional Year Program, a program 
for inner-city high school graduates designed to bridge the gap between high 
school and college. TYP makes use of Yale 
facilities, but its support comes from the 
Rockefeller Foundation. Richmond 
teaches humanities and serves as a dormitory counselor to the male students in the 
program, who live in the Elm Street building which also houses his apartment-a 
cavernous, old, high-ceilinged suite of five 
rooms, reached by an ancient elevator 
painted fire-engine red by a bored fellow 
student.


The Richmonds' apartment is white and 
sparsely furnished; most of the space is 
taken up by Richmond's paintings, which 
fill the walls of every room and seem 
almost to overflow the apartment. His two 
albums of drawings, the Book of Rath and 
the Book of Joys--macabre and delightful, seeming crosses between Ronald 
Searle's cartoons and art nouveau--compete with books for storage space in the 
study. During my visit an oil in progress 
sat on the living-room easel, dominating 
the room. Richmond sat in a rocker just 
across from the easel, eager to talk about 
TYP or micro-economics, but not about 
art: "I've now become an educator," he 
said, "and now people, including me, are 
concerned with things of the world today. 
The art is other-worldly, it is about the 
imagination, and I prefer a private investigation of the imagination. So I paint just 
for myself now." He has also put an end to 
selling his work: "Now that I have a salary 
and a wife, I don't have to."


He said The New Journal was welcome 
to reprint a few drawings, and suddenly 
he was up from his chair, busying himself 
with the Book of Rath and the Book of 
Joys. "Take this," he said producing a 
frightening pen-and-ink piece of surrealism 
-"no, maybe not, it's too sick." He smiled 
and gave it to me anyway, then carefully 
selected three more samples of his talent. 


The care with which Richmond selected 
the sample drawings-he spent considerable time musing over the albums--is 
characteristic of him. He has worked tirelessly on the micro-economics program, 
and hopes to win the support of a graduate 
school for research into the area.


So far micro-economics has been tried 
in only two classrooms, the P.S. 250 and 
P.S. 122 fifth grades Richmond taught 
during 1967-68; yet in both situations, the 
program was successful almost from the 
start. Basically, as Richmond explains it, 
micro-economics represented simply a use 
of means familiar to the ghetto--financial 
inducement-in place of means like 
grades, products of a middle-class approach which Richmond sees as based on 
"incentives of feudal sophistication." The 
end, academic progress, stayed the same; 
only the inducement changed. Yet in the 
process, Richmond notes, academic progress suddenly became acceptable, and 
the criteria for prestige in his classroom 
changed: "The original leadership based 
on force, strength and muscle alliances was 
replaced by an elite, determined by ability 
and wealth."


Once the system of monetary rewards 
for academic achievement was firmly 
entrenched, Richmond expanded the program to include a real-estate game. Stu-
