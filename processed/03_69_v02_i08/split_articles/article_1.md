When this observer sacked out at 5 A.M. 
on the first day of Sarah Lawrence's Coed 
Week, there were still a fair number of bull 
sessions in progress. One group stayed up 
all night discussing "consciousness," although by discussion's end they must have 
been talking only from memory. However, 
to imply that all the girls were eager, or 
even willing, to get to know the recent 
arrivals would be inaccurate. A number of 
the male participants noted fierce indifference on the part of many of the permanent 
residents.


Classes must not be very central to the 
education process at Sarah Lawrence, for 
the girls did not seem to take them very 
seriously. Even in comparison with Yale 
seminars, for which the level of preparation is often not very impressive, the class 
discussions betrayed a remarkable lack of 
familiarity with the material at hand. But 
the classes are not a waste of time. Probably having long since reconciled themselves to the obvious fact that the students 
are not going to be able to sustain very 
learned discussions, the teachers go to 
rather imaginative lengths at least to keep 
their students entertained for the hour, if 
only to break the silence which would 
otherwise prevail. In one European history 
class the professor's short attempt at substantive discussion of the political and economic relationships of the various social 
classes during Louis XIV's reign was met 
with general looking out of windows and 
lighting up of cigarettes. The class spent 
most of the time airing their views as to 
whether Louis was "really happy" living at 
Versailles. A visitor from Harvard noted 
a certain lack of "analytical rigor" in the 
class's discussion, demonstrating a capacity for understatement for which his 
institution is not particularly known.


This apparent lack of interest in class is 
not meant to suggest that Sarah Lawrence 
has anything in common with Briarcliff, 
beyond proximity. I was roundly assured 
by students and teachers alike that the real 
education goes on in the conferences. 
Conferences, for those unfamiliar with the 
jargon, are described by the Sarah Lawrence catalogue as follows: 
"Conferences permit continual interchange 
between students and faculty and afford students the kind of personal guidance in their 
work that should enable them to move ahead 
to higher levels of understanding and fuller 
use of their developing talents."


In other words, conferences are a system 
in which each student meets regularly with 
each of her professors to demonstrate her 
ignorance not only of the material assigned 
to the entire class but also of material in 
her field of particular interest.


In most cases the visiting males refrained from participating in class discussions, perhaps under the delusion, perpetrated at some leading Eastern universities, that one should be familiar with the material under discussion before opening 
his mouth. However there were some 
reports of guys not only participating, but 
pressing their points rather vigorously. 
These stories were generally related by the 
natives with an amused comment about 
little boys attempting to assert their masculinity. In fact there are few things a guy 
can do that will be less appreciated by 
Sarah Lawrence girls than to attempt to 
suggest his masculine superiority. These 
women are generally not well disposed, at 
least intellectually, to any such doctrine.


While calling the visitors "coeds" was a 
widely repeated joke around the campus 
on Monday, I suggest that by the end of 
the week many of the guys were wondering, if they ever were to get one of these 
girls into bed, who would wind up on top. 
However, once again the temptation to 
generalize must be curbed, when the subject is the Sarah Lawrence student body. 


In the fight presently being waged against 
a higher tuition, for example, two of the 
leading figures (the author of the students' 
alternative to the hike and the chairman 
of the open meeting held last week) were 
men. And as only thirteen of the 592 students at Sarah Lawrence are male, this is 
rather suggestive. One cannot help pondering whether these girls are, in fact, no 
more truly "liberated" than the girls in the 
building occupied by the Colombia students last spring, who (according to a 
friend on the inside) "did all the cooking 
and cleaning up, while the men went out 
to defend the fortress."


The other current campus issue, not 
unrelated to the tuition increase, is the 
"diversity" of the student body. The present tuition and room and board fee of 
$3,950, coupled with the limited scholarship funds available, do circumscribe the 
range of backgrounds from which the students are drawn. In fact, most of the girls 
seem to come from upper-middle and 
upper class homes in the New York area, 
a limitation which is presently the subject 
of much debate. What is most interesting 
is that the freshman class, generally drawn 
from terribly respectable and probably 
sheltered homes, is collectively regarded 
as a wild group of people, even by Sarah 
Lawrence's permissive standards. It is a 
well accepted adage around the campus 
that "whatever you are looking for can be 
found in the freshman dorms." The story 
of the freshmen who gave LSD to their 
cat and then dropped him from a fourth-
floor window to see if he would land on 
his feet (he did not) was the wildest of the 
freshman stories, but not by as large a 
margin as might be expected. In many 
cases, though, the upper-class years find a 
return to a more sedate style of life. Perhaps these girls will come full circle and 
return to nearby Scarsdale to raise a family 
and spend their days as fruitlessly as their 
frustrated mothers, possibly substituting 
pot for alcohol, demonstrating that their 
Sarah Lawrence education did not fail to 
leave some impression.
