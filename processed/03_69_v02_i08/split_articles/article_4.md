Associated Student Agencies of Yale University 
: ... ... 
dents used their scrip to purchase blocks 
of imaginary real estate and make invest-
ments, like a vast game of Monopoly, 
which grew, Richmond says, "until one 
day a group of students came to me and 
asked why they couldn't establish a bank. 
Soon after, a savings institution developed. 
We created an entire credit system, and 
some students became professional bank-
ers in the classroom." Richmond supple-
mented the math curriculum with simple 
lessons in accounting, corporate finance 
and economics to guide the citizens of his 
micro-economy. To guide the leader of the 
micro-economy, the help of New York 
University was invoked: Richmond be-
came a registered student at the School of 
Business Administration. 
Soon, Richmond recalls, the game began 
almost automatically to produce the social 
revolution he had hoped for. "There was 
a young boy in the class who on the whole 
was shy and retiring," he says, "and be-
路 
cause of the class structure motivated by 
muscle, he had played little, if any, part in 
the Class esteem. Yet he nearly always 
scored one hundred on his math tests, and 
under the pressure of the game began to 
do the same on his spelling tests. At a 
dollar a point, he began to amass quite a 
bit of cash and to loan it out at attractive 
interest rates. Soon, unbeknownst to him-
self and the class, he began to achieve 
enviable stature and importance in their 
lives. The social order went through a quiet 
revolution, and acumen combined with 
work became respectable. I managed to 
convince him to employ the ruffians in the 
class to collect everyone's debts, and we 
had the beginnings of a police system." 
Richmond's students became increas-
ingly aware of their adjusted statuses, and 
it was perhaps only a matter of time before 
one student asked whether there was a 
welfare system. Richmond-"because I 
had a wicked sense of ~umor"-said yes, 
and began taxing the rich in the game to 
supply scrip to the poor. Friction grew be-
tween the rich and the poor, but before a 
confrontation could occur, Richmond was 
transferred to an路other school. 
He is hesitant to conclude that his trans-
fer was the路 result of the micro-economics 
game. "It could be," he says, "but I have 
no grounds to know for sure." Whatever 
the cause, he started micro-economics with 
his new class, also a group of fifth graders 
from a poor neighborhood. He added a 
reading program to the scrip reward sys-
tem, and it was here that phenomemil rise 
in reading level, from a minimum of eight 
months to four years, took place. 
The second success of micro-economics 
led Richmond to conceive of his current 
plan, which he hopes will win the approval 
of a graduate-school faculty. In collabora-
tion with Bill Watman, now a staff member 
at the Office of Economic Opportunity, 
Richmond expanded the micro-economics 
concept to an entire school. "The school 
would be a small life-game," he says, "with 
the development of school-wide small 
businesses, stockmarket games and even 
horseracing games. There would be a legis-
lative system, and social action programs 
in the real community funded by a founda-
tion within the school." 
Ultimately, Richmond sees the students 
in the urban school, which would be at the 
junior-high level, planning their own 
curriculum. "What they would study 
would be about the city," he says. "They 
would read about welfare, war, love, hate, 
slums, children-the curriculum would be 
in their own vernacular." Richmond's 
urban school would contain a complete 
range of social services, with students 
dealing with criminal offenders-i.e., dis-
cipline problems-in their own way. 
A school store would be open monthly 
to allow for the exchange of scrip for 
merchandise, all earned by academic per-
formance. "This will allow the poor 
student to have some stake in the society," 
Richmond says. "And when he has that 
stake he will protect it. It's as real and as 
near to him as the middle-class system of 
grades is far from him. The school will be 
a state-a state in which the children pre-
pare for life by playing roles, where they 
deal with the real problems of a state." 
The urban school represents an entirely 
new concept of the relationship between 
student and teacher-one generated by 
aggregate demand. Price theory would 
become crucial to the classroom; once the 
school is operating fully on Richmond's 
concepts, students would not only receive 
money for educational achievements, they 
would pay money for the chance to edu-
cate themselves. The course offerings 
would become a marketplace, with stu-
dents purchasing their way into class. 
Faculty and administration would be in 
the position to control prices so as to make 
certain "preferred" courses attractive. 
English, for example, would be priced 
cheaply, and students showing a tendency 
to restrict themselves to one subject area 
would be taxed by the administration for 
extra courses in that area. 
Perhaps the most significant feature of 
George Richmond's urban school is the 
plan for backing the value of the scrip. 
Students can, of course, cash their scrip 
into property at the store, or they can in-
vest it in one of two ways. A system of 
stock and real-estate investing would allow 
students to build up scrip capital, which 
would be redeemed in real cash for a 
fraction of its scrip value at high school 
graduation. The final alternative-and the 
most exciting-is to invest academic 
achievement scrip in "educational bonds," 
which would mature at high school gradu-
ation into college scholarships. Thus, in 
every sense, the ghetto child of the urban 
school will truly 路have earned his own 
college education. 
What are the drawbacks to the system? 
Discussing his proposals in New Haven, 
Richmond sees few, if any. The profit in-
centive, he argues, is here to stay, and be 
finds little wrong with exploiting it to a 
good advantage. He responds to the critics 
who attack the application of real-life eco-
nomic principles to the classroom by 
calling the school the ideal place for first 
grappling with the e.conomy; for "there is 
no such thing as unfair competition in the 
classroom. There are no monopolies, no 
price fixing; no one inherits wealth, 
thereby starting life out in a more advan-
tageous position than the next person, and 
there is no political pull or graft." 
Richmond realizes the radical nature of 
his urban school and, despite its astonish-
ing success on a classroom scale in New 
York, he bas no illusions about its un-
attractiveness to conservative school ad-
ministrators. "But it is a non-utopian 
system," the ex-Yale, ex-Lower East Side 
artist-turned-educator emphasizes, "and is 
only meant as a transitional stage, not an 
end in itself. It's just one possible way out 
of the difficulty our schools are in now." 
It is just one possible way out; but this 
way, unlike all the others, might just work, 
because as George Richmond says, "It 
doesn't come from the educators; it comes 
from the kids." ::;
