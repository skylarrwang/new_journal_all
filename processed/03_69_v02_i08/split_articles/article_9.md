any group, its moral justification notwith-
standing, to presume to be able to exist 
Â· 
and operate outside of this political-cul-
tural and fanatical belief, is to bring down 
a self-righteousness, a racial vengeance 
upon those who presume to take a different 
direction. 

The teaching of black studies as it exists 
today is most often an intellectual black 
assault upon this white American point 
of view. The successful teaching of these 
studies, and the not so successful teaching 
of them, will prepare a predilection for 
black cultural separatism. The fact that 
white universities are teaching courses in 
black studies means one of two things: 
either these universities are certain that 
the kind of black students they have is not 
of the same militant and revolutionary 
genre as those blacks in established black 
political organizations; or that those stu-
dents are quite simply what Malcolm X 
called "house niggers." For the white 
university, being a special representative 
of the total white establishment, could not 
be unaware that they are possibly training 
the radical elements to bring about their 
destruction. 

Thus white universities will cease to 
contain and to entertain any black student 
wish or demand or threat the moment the 
satisfaction of those demands is sus-
pected to contain the destruction of the 
universities. White universities were not 
founded, after all, for the benefit of black 
Americans, so much as they are establish-
ment for the perpetuation of white cultural 
consciousness-whatever that conscious-
ness may be in terms of particular political 
and social environments. 

Ironically, and lamentably, black stud-
ies is not taught with the same intensity, 
nor with the same direction, in predomi-
nantly black universities. Apparently, one 
does not have to be made constantly aware 
of one's cultural contribution to the coun-
try if one is placed in a psychologically 
secure position-a majority position in a 
black university, which could be regarded 
as a psychological oasis in the midst of a 
desert. 

Apparently, blacks in this situation do 
not need to advertise themselves culturally 
and historically when there are no whites 
around to question or compromise that 
cultural and historical contribution. Ap-
parently, also, blacks are content to be 
ignorant about themselves among them-
selves ("We know where we art at!") and 
when there are no whites in their academic 
vicinity. 

The non-academic considerations which 
limit the approach and the effectiveness of 
the teaching of black studies in predomi-
nantly white universities will victimize 
white intellectuals who seek, "out of a 
clear conscience," to teach such studies 
after years of academic preparation. There 
are, conceivably, some well-intentioned 
white intellectuals who have a real interest 
in black studies in the same way that it 
can be said that there are white people who 
have a non-liberal, non-white-participa-
tory interest outside of political organiza-
tions, in the black man. 

This must be the case. Since this type of 
white man would confess that the fate of 
the country is bound up in the respective 
fates of the blacks and of the whites, no 
logic, be it derived from black nationalism, 
black consciousness, black manhood, can 
refuse to admit to the possibility of the 
sincerity and the valuable contribution that 
these types of white people can give-per-
haps it should be said, can offer. 

What then is going to happen to the 
white intellectual, himself a kind of radi-
cal because of his commitment to the 
essentiality of black studies, who feels 
strongly that he can contribute, academi-
cally? Is the black revolution in ideas going 
to throw him out with the bath water of 
disillusioned white liberalism? Is the hu-
manism that is a characteristic of the 
psyche of the black man going to be sacri-
ficed in order to adhere to the strictest 
principles of black intellectual chauvinists? 
To put the question quite simply, can the 
black revolution in ideas and practices 
afford to sacrifice this natural resource of 
exploitable white radicalism? :,:;
