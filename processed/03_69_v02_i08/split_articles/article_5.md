The checkered career of 
an ex-copyboy: an interview 
with Samuel Fuller 
by Eric Sherman and Martin Rubin 
Eric Sherman, '68, made Charles Lloyd-
Journey Within as a Scholar of the House 
in film. His new film, Mario and the 
Magician, will be shown at Yale on April 4. 
M artin Rubin is the current chairman of 
the Yale Film Society. His next project 
will be a book on the American director 
Douglas Sirk. 
The following interview is an excerpt deal-
ing with only six of Fuller's eighteen films. 
The complete interview, covering his 
career film by film, will be published this 
spring by Atheneum in the Authors' book 
Five American Film Makers. in addition 
to the section on Fuller, the book will 
contain interviews with Budd Boetticher, 
Peter Bokdanovich, Arthur Penn, and 
Abraham Polonsky. 
Samuel Fuller is perhaps the most aggressive 
of all film-makers. His films are concerned 
with the direct physical and visual communi-
cation of emotional impact. In a review of 
The Naked Kiss, critic Michael Delahaye of 
Cahiers du Cinema made an observation 
which could apply to all of Fuller's films: "Let 
him who is not a ghost dare to say he has felt 
nothing." 
. 
Fuller's films often deal with pimps, swin-
dlers, gangsters, prostitutes, petty crooks, 
stool pigeons, low-income detectives--people 
on the lower fringe of society. The borderline 
position of these characters makes them easily 
detachable from the mainstream of social 
concerns and allows them to act out Fuller's 
favorite drama: the conflict between personal, 
emotional interests and the impersonal, 
mechanical responses dictated by social and 
environmental superstructures. 
His police-blotter lineup of characters also 
gives Fuller's stories the flavor of back-page 
features in newspapers like the Daily News or 
the Daily Graphic, for which Fuller was once 
a reporter. For example, one can easily envi-
sion The Naked Kiss in tabloid terms: "EX-
CALL GIRL KILLS MILLIONAIRE FIANCE!" We 
recognize the potential depersonalization of 
these stories into the protective cliches which 
newspaper headlines symbolize (i.e., "150 
KILLED IN PLANE CRASH"). However, Fuller's 
forceful, violent presentation of the material 
erases the comfortable distance we like to 
establish between ourselves and the medium. 
In his recent films, The Crimson Kimono, 
Underworld, USA, Shock Corridor and 
The Naked Kiss, Fuller has shown a complete 
command of the means necessary to shake the 
most complacent audience out of its habitual 
apathy. 
The director's commitment to an emotional 
and personal value system has led many 
critics to oversimplify, to characterize his 
talent as "primitive." Some of Fuller's most 
devoted admirers like to picture their hero as 
some sort of lovable ape-man swinging his 
camera around on a rope. This conception 
would be more viable if Fuller eschewed all 
concerns other than those personal ones he 
prefers. However, Fuller's world-view encom-
passes with equal depth all aspects of the 
conflict he presents. The outer, social frame-
works which threaten his characters' emotion-
al integrity are indicated with admirable force 
in nearly all of his films. The city in Pickup 
on South Street, established in ominous reflec-
tions on street windows and the huge bridge 
looming outside Richard Widmark's shack, 
eventually becomes in Underworld, USA 
the gigantic superstructure of National Proj-
ects, which infects and perverts practically 
every level of American society-from sports 
and charity to fammal devotion and big 
business. 
Fuller's films depict a society in the final 
rigor mortis of institutionalization. He calls 
for a complete revitalization of that society 
on a primal emotional level, even in the most 
violent manner. Fuller's visual equivalent of 
the personil impulse is the close-up, which 
he uses more frequently and more forcefully 
than any other film-maker. The visual rhythm 
throughout Fuller's films is from long-shot to 
close-up and then back to long-shot. Similarly, 
the structure of his stories goes from a long, 
establishing view of an outer framework to 
closer, personal dramas (often in direct con-
flict with the larger perspective) and finally 
back to the original position, now re-evaluated 
and refashioned in completely personal terms. 
The final long-shots of the corridor in Shock 
Corridor and the route to the bus station in 
The Naked Kiss are repeated from contexts 
earlier in the film, but their meaning is com-
pletely changed in light of the volcanic emo-
tional struggles which have intervened. 
With the exceptions of Baron of Arizona, 
Hell and High Water, Merrill's Marauders 
and Shark, Fuller has exercised virtually com-
plete control over every aspect of his films. 
His personality has revealed itself consistently 
and progressively in all eighteen of his motion 
pictures. The following interview was con-
ducted at his home in Los Angeles in Novem-
ber, 1968. 
The Steel Helmet 
Sergeant Zack's (Gene Evans) entire pla-
toon is massacred by the North Koreans. He 
survives by a freak accident involving his 
helmet. He is aided by a Korean orphan whom 
he calls Short Round. They join a platoon 
commanded by a rule-book lieutenant (Steve 
Brodie) whom Zack despises. The platoon sets 
up an observation post in a Buddhist temple, 
and they apprehend a Communist who is lurk-
ing inside. When Short Round is killed by a 
sniper, Zack, in a rage, kills the prisoner. In 
a massive attack on the temple, the lieutenant 
is killed while showing exceptional bravery. 
Zack bestows his charmed helmet on the 
lieutenant's grave and leaves with the other 
three survivors. 
The relation between Sgt. Zack and the 
little boy is similar to the one between 
Price and Drew in The Baron of Arizona. 
Zack doesn't realize the boy's attachment 
to him until after the boy is killed. 
Ah yes! I see what you mean. Any damn 
emotional cementing between them 
grows on them. Yes, you're right. 
What Zack epitomized there was the 
symbol of a non com: no emotion what-
soever. None! Because if you have emo-
tions, you're not in war. There's no time 
for emotion. It becomes a job. You wake 
up. You work a little. Maybe you go on 
·a patrol or a little skirmish line. Your 
fight is very brief. You rest. You crap. 
You eat. Then you go out and shoot 
again. You go to sleep. Then you get 
up . .. . 
If you do this for three years, it's just 
a job. It's a tremendous machine inside 
you. The only emotion you have is, 
''When do I get out of here, and when 
does somebody replace me?" That's 
the only emotion you ever experience 
in war. You become very aware of 
sounds. You become very aware of 
sight. And you become very aware of 
trust in man. Very aware. If I know you 
two fellows are on my right, that•s fine. 
If I'm worried about you, I'm in trouble. 
So I thought it might be a very effec-
tive scene if Zack blows his top, not 
because of the enemy or shooting or all 
that, but because of a kid. You should 
never blow your top over a person 
who's on your side. The kid was on his 
side. You did catch something there; it 
was a growing love affair. It was a love 
story. 
When Zack blew his top, he shot 
down an unarmed P.O.W. To me, that 
was not a shocker. It was to the press. 
Tremendous shocker. A lot of editorials. 
I have all the newspapers. Big full-page 
interviews asking, ''Would You Shoot 
This Man?" You see, I think it's a little 
on the stupid side, when you're in war, 
to hold your fire just because a man 
puts his hands up. Five minutes before 
that, he's shooting at you. He runs out 
of ammunition; he can put his hands up. 
I mean, certainly there's no law. If 
there's a law in war, then we're really 
completely nuts. Now, we're only 
ninety-nine percent nuts. But if there's 
a law .. . how can there be a law in an 
illegal act? 
So I cannot get concerned about 
shooting a prisoner. It means nothing 
to me. Absolutely nothing. I think the 
idea of shooting a man is more impor-
tant. I don't care whether he's a friend 
or an enemy. But the idea that we have 
laws and Geneva Conventions and rules 
and regulations is a cover-up for a lot 
of stupid things. 
To me, the thrill of war-.nd there 
is a tremendous thrill--is death. That's 
the only thing I'm really interested in, 
because it's the only mystery. That's 
why I'll always dramatize it. I don't 
think there's anything more dramatic 
in motion pictures than death, even 
though w.e assume we're cold-blooded 
a nd can take it for granted. I don't know 
of any other subject. At all. 
I seldom heard a dying man make a 
speech. The general things you hear, 
when a man is hit next to you, are, "Oh 
no. Oh hell. Oh hell no. Ohhhh noooo. 
Please. Please. Not me." 
That's exactly what the "mute" soldier in 
Steel Helmet says when he's killed. 
Oh right! That's what he says. That's 
what you say, and you go. That's exactly 
what happens. None of this: " Now, I 
want to tell you one thing, Joshua . .. 
Two miles down there, you go to your 
left, you find Nora ... She's got a horse 
waiting ... Tell her the sheriff said, 
'lchabod Crane was right.' " 
It's selfish. All exits are selfish--and 
personal. And that's the way it should 
be. 
Pickup on South Street 
On a crowded subway, Skip McCoy (Richard 
Widmark) picks the purse of Candy (Jean 
Peters). Among his booty, although he 
does not know it at the time, is a piece of 
top-secret microfilm that was being passed by 
Candy's consort, a communist agent (Richard 
Kiley). When Candy discovers the where-
abouts of the film through Moe Williams 
(Thelma Ritter), a police informer, she at-
tempts to seduce McCoy and recover the film. 
After several failures, she falls in love with 
him. The desperate agent exterminates Moe 
and savagely beats Candy. McCoy, now 
goaded into action, apprehends the agent in 
a particularly brutal fight in a subway. McCoy 
and Candy, temporarily reformed, are re-
united. 
The opening of the picture is played com-
pletely without d ialogue, when Widmark 
picks the girl's pocketbook containing the 
secret information. This gives the action 
a great deal of ambiguity. It's only much 
later in the picture that you find out what 
actually transpired. So, instead of starting 
out on a "Commies versus the Good Guys" 
note, you're primarily concerned with 
personal issues from the start. 
You're right about the ambiguity. The 
ending is like that,·too. Some people 
thought, ''Well, I guess he'll go off with 
the girl and be happy." I gave her a line 
at the end to show that they'll never 
change. The cop nys, " No matter wlult 
happens, l'lrfind this son-of-a-bitch in 
a week or two with his hand in some-
body's pocket." She says, ''You wanna 
bet?" The way she wid that showed tlult

I wanted the audience to feel he even· 
tually will go back to picking pockets, 
and she'll go back to doing whatever 
the hell she wu doing. 
This is what I got a kick out of in the 
picture: the idea of having a pickpocket, 
a police informer and a h• lf-assed 
hooker u the three main characters. 
The picture was made in about eighteen 
or twe nty days at Fox. A big picture for 
me. The whole thing was shot in down-
town L.A., and I used a lot of tricks to 
make It look like New York. 
Was the subway a set? 
It was a set. I told the ut director I 
w anted those stairs, because I liked the 
idea of Widmark pulling Kiley down 
by the ankles, and the heavy's chin 
hits e ve ry step. Dat-dat-dat-dat-dat: it's 
musical. 
Although you establish the city very force-
fully in the film, you seem to be more 
interested in individuals than in the struc-
tures, political or otherwise, that surround 
the characters. 
Oh, sure. More than that, too. I specifi-
cally hit hard on describing Kiley not as 
a communist but •s an agent. There's a 
big difference. Tremendous difference. 
An agent is a paid employee. If tomor· 
row •nother country will give him more 
money, he will do it for them. It's got 
nothing to do with p•rty affiliation. 
Nothing political•bout it at all. But 
when I talked to people, even on the 
set, all they thought wu, "Well, he's a 
Commie." I didn't want just that. That's 
too obvious. 
A Commie doesn't mean to me what 
he does to a lot of other people. I mean, 
there are communists all over the world. 
I even know communists who hate 
other communists. Frankly, I don't un-
derstand what they're talking about. 
It's all meaningless. Politics bore me, 
but the politici•ns do not bore me, be-
cause they're chuuters. 
That's why I played down the politi· 
cal situation in Pickup. I was not inter-
ested in the structure. I could have had 
a hell of • big scene with fifty or sixty 
extras. They're all gathered together, 
and the head man says: ''This is terrible. 
What about the Party?" You never hear 
the word "Party'' in my film. 
You are never even told that the FBI 
man in Pickup is from the FBI. He's just 
from the government. I didn't w•nt to 
pinpoint it. At th•t time, Fuchs, the Brit-
ish espionage agent, had been arrested 
for selling information to Russia. The 
government man in the film says to 
Widmark, "You know about Fuchs. You 
know what he did.'' Wid mark says, "I 
don't know what you're t•lking about. 
I don't care.'' That's the mood I wanted 
to get in the picture. 
This seemed to be the most "close-up" of 
your films. You even kept dolying in from 
a close-up to a more extreme close-up. 
Oh yes. You noticed that? I like to do 
that sometimes. My first film, I Shot 
Jesse James, was also shot with a lot 
of close-ups. 
Why? 
Because I'm not interested in the bank 
or the people in the bank. I'm interested 
in a teller who is going to be shot and 
the man who is going to shoot him. The 
same thing in Pickup. Come to think of 
it, there are very few extras in the film, 
very few people around .. . . 
There was another technique in the film 
which I especially liked: the way you 
moved the camera. For example, at one 
point Widmark has to get out of his shack:, 
and be swings across the water on a rope. 
Rather than simply following the action, 
the camera moved back before he swung. 
There was the same type of thing in the 
long-take where Jean Peters is getting beat 
up by Kiley. The camera would go to 
where the action was going, before the 
action actually went there. 
In that scene with Peters, I told the 
camer•man, "Give me a leeway. M•ke 
it loose enough, but fluid at all times. 
Don't hang around too long.'' I w•nted 
th•t fluidity, because the camer• can 
help the eye with action. If your camer• 
is moving, and your action is moving-
boy, you have •ctionl lf your action is 
moving, •nd your camera is st•tionary, 
it is not that effective. It's •lso better not 
to just follow the action. Again, it's your 
eye. I want to go beyond the eye. So 
you have two sets of eyes: the camera 
is moving, and your own eye is moving. 
Just before the scene of Thelma Ritter's 
death, there's a shot of her seUing her neck-
ties in a construction area at night. I got 
a hellish, underworld feeling from that 
shot. Were you trying for this? 
Oh no. What I wanted there was con· 
struction. I wanted something that is 
being born right before somebody is 
dead. I w•nted something alive. I 
wanted one of those riveting machines 
and fire and lights and life. Alivel 
Noisy! Because it's going to be very 
quiet soon-for her. 
Forty Guns 
Griff Bonnell (Barry Sullivan) and his brother 
Wes (Gene Barry) ride into town and throw 
Brockie Drummond (John Ericson), a local 
troublemaker, into jail. Brockie's sister Jessica 
(Barbara Stanwyck) comes with her forty 
hired gunmen and frees Brockie. After 
Brockie kills Wes on his wedding day, Griff 
confronts him. Using his sister's body as a 
shield, Brockie threatens Griff. Griff, ignoring 
his personal feelings toward Jessica, shoots 
both of them. 
I was originally going to c• ll it Woman 
with a Whip. I don't like the title Forty 
Guns: it's meaningless to me. Origin•l-
ly, Marilyn Monroe wanted to play the 
lead role. She liked the idea of this girl 
surrounded by all these men. I thought 
she was too young for what I wanted. 
I wanted a mothe r-sister flavor there. 
The stuntmen refused to do the scene 
where the Stanwyck chuacter is 
dragged by a horse. They thought it was 
too dangerous. So Stanwyck said she'd 
do it, and she did it. We did it the first 
time, and I said: "I didn't like it. It was 
too far away from the came ra truck. 
We're not getting what I want." So we 
tried it again, and I didn't like it. She 
made no complaint. We tried it a third 
time, a nd it was just the way I wanted 
it. She was quite bruised, quite bruised. 
Oh yes. That was for the mood. I just 
wanted something beautiful, because 
the idea of technical, mechanical beauty 
(I usually don't like anything mechani-
cal) was the only contrut I could get to 
the action, the violence. I tried to time 
each one of those dissolves so that it 
was almost like music, a beautiful piece 
of music, and all hell broke loose right 
after or right before that. l couldn't 
have gotten any other contrast, unless I 
used along talking scene, and I didn't 
want that. 
Contrut makes emotion-that's what 
makes music, that's what makes paint· 
ing. Rembrandt, with his color, will use 
beautiful, subdued black-black-blue or 
blue-blue-black--Jesus, you can't tell 
what color it Js...-.-.nd then there's that 
hot gold or red with that one light. 
That's beautiful contrast. I just love that 
kind of stuff. I tried to get It in those 
long dissolves. 
T here is a pervasive sense of death in the 
picture, connected with sexual acts specifi-
cally. The most striking example of this is 
the wedding scene, where the groom is shot 
and falls dead on his bride. 
You're right. I thought I would get a 
little touch of that in. I liked the idea of 
the honeymoon bed being the grave. 
The only time he really got to touch her, 
he was dead. 
I thought I would even contrast that 
scene a little bit, as far as sex was con-
cerned, with the sce ne where the gun-
smith's daughter measures Gene Barry 
for a weapon. I thought I'd have a little 
fun with sex, because the connotations 
were all there. I had a shot where he 
looks at the girl through a loose gun 
barrel; and as she walks, he pans with 
her, just like a camera. When I wu in 
Paris, Godard told me he used that shot 
in Breathless, except that instead of a 
rifle, Belmondo rolls up a newspaper 
and follows Seberg walking. Godard 
said he took that from my film. 
I could not use my original ending. I 
was asked to change it, and I changed 
it. The ending I originally shot was a 
· powe rful ending. I had Sullivan facing 
the killer, the young brother of Stan· 
wyck. I had him grab Stanwyck and 
hold her in front of him. He knew he 
had Sullivan in a spot. I had him defy 
Sullivan. And Sullivan kills Stanwyck. 
Then he kills the boy and walks away. 
That was the end of the pidure. 
I had to put in that line where Sulli-
van says that he aimed the bullet so that 
it wouldn't kill Stanwyck. She's alive in 
the end, and they're happy. I didn't 
like that ending. A lot of people liked it, 
because they like to see the boy and 
the girl get together. I don't think that's 
important. I think it's much more dra-
matic the other way, because Sullivan 
has to blow his top. That's why he 
hasn't used a gun in ten years. But the 
moment he squeezes that trigger, he's 
a diffe rent man. He's an executioner, 
and he kills anything in front of him. 
Underworld, USA 
When he was a child, Tolly Devlin (Cliff 
Robertson), now a petty safecracker, saw four 
shadows on a wall beat and kill his father. He 
has devoted his life to tracking down the 
murderers. In a prison hospital, one of them 
divulges the other names as he dies. They are 
Gunther (Gerald Milton}, Gela (Paul Dubov) 
and Smith (Allen Greuner), top men in a 
huge crime syndicate known as Underworld, 
USA. which is run under the business front 
of National Projects by Earl "Boss" Connors 
(Robert Emhardt). Devlin infiltrates the or-
ganization and uses the law to dispose of all 
three men. Having accomplished his purpose, 
he seeks to withdraw and marry Cuddles 
(Dolores Dorn), a prostitute whom he is using
