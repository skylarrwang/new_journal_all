**Title: So Who's a Schmo?**
**Author: Don Davis**
**Page number(s): 2-3, 14**

Leo Ribuffo tells us that graduate students 
are schmoos. Leo Rosten tells us that Al 
Capp's endearing little creature is actually 
a schmo and that "any schmo knows what 
a schmo really is." Are graduate students 
really as bad as the pungent Yiddish epithet applied to them implies? Mr. Ribuffo 
doesn't really seem to know. For with all 
his railing against the insufferable dullness 
of Yale graduate students, he implies that 
most of these poor wretches could, if they 
awakened their sleeping imaginations, 
blossom into something productive like a 
dentist, a lawyer, a writer, a musician or a 
forest ranger. If graduate students really 
have within themselves the power to set 
the world ablaze but just can't seem to 
realize it, then, like the repressed dames of 
Victorian fiction, they are more to be pitied 
than censured. If, on the other hand, they 
each wrongly think they could drill teeth 
with more verve than Major Peress, argue 
the law more deftly than Perry Mason, 
write hotter stuff than Harold Robbins, 
play a meaner flute than King David and 
sniff out more fires than Smokey the Bear, 
then they are indeed "schmos."


I propose we find out just how much 
hidden brain and talent there is among 
graduate students in a way that would 
more than satisfy Mr. Ribuffo's plea for 
more frivolity and whimsy among the 
Ph.D. seekers. Could not graduate students 
agree to re-do something they have all been 
through many times since summer camp 
days, namely have an all-graduate-student 
revue? Here is the ideal vehicle for releasing all the pent-up energies that have 
smoldered for so long in the graduate's 
breast. I do not for one moment believe 
that much real talent will be discovered in 
such a venture, and I fear that a musical 
extravaganza staged by my peers may be 
about as whimsical as the leaden matzo 
balls my grandmother, the worst cook in 
Grodno Gobernya, used to inflict upon her 
family. This is beside the point, for a Yale 
grad revue will provide its perpetrators 
with something to tell their grandchildren 
which will be more true than tales of their 
disastrous love affairs and less damaging 
to their sense of decency than the real story 
of how they invented half of the sources 
listed in the bibliographies of their doctoral 
dissertations.


Obviously the vulgar talent needed to 
produce a satirical-romantical revue 
abounds in the Yale graduate school. In 
college the aspiring but incompetent playwright had to compete with students who 
could actually write plays, the ham with 
the real actor, the wise guy with people 
with real senses of humor, and the high 
school drum major with the musician. 
Here in the grad school the pros would be 
excluded and the amateur talent could 
flourish uninhibited.


Ideas for the plot of the revue quickly 
come to mind. A colonial historian I know 
wants to exhume a work he did a few years 
back called "Plymouth Rock." Another 
friend who is torn between a love of the 
transcending power of the Baroque and a 
keenly felt need to be topical wants to 
write something on the current racial situation called "The Well-Tempered Cleaver." 
I myself favor a saga about a former graduate student who becomes in turn a dentist, 
lawyer and novelist while living in a forest 
and destroying his mind by blowing the 
oboe. Mr. Ribuffo could certainly contribute some wheezy but serviceable jokes, 
for in his eleven paragraphs he was able to 
drop a gag (the one about the kvetch-
schrift) which does not yet suffer from 
rigor mortis.


Performers should be no harder to corral. Probably ninety percent of all grads 
were made to endure some sort of music 
lessons in their youth. Surely a band
