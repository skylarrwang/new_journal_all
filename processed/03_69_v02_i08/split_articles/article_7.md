XEROX COPIES ON YOUR MIND?

given her a Naked Kiss, she's shocked 
and he's shocked that she's shocked. ' 
Since she's a hooker, he thought that 
she would understand why he likes 
little girls. Why should she be sur-
prized? He just hit the wrong girl. 
I thought that was good copy. 
Shark. (Caine.) (Twist of the Knife.) 
I had what I felt was a brainstorm: 
doing a story about four amoral char-
acters. One is a scientist: no morals. One 
is the girl he's laying: no morals. One is 
the young hero: no morals. One is the 
cop: no morals. I thought it would be 
interesting to show not only a double-
cross on a double-cross, but when we 
think we know who the heavy is, we 
find out that the real heavy behind it is 
the girl. She's the lowest. She does have 
a chance to get out of it alive, if she 
levels with the lead. But she doesn't. 
She is responsible for her own death. 
He lets her die. In other words, I tried 
something different there. They're in 
love and all that stuff, and I have the 
hero not only allow her to die, but he 
shrugs it off. I thought that was ex-
citing. 
I like the idea of a love affair where 
the man finds out the girl has used him. 
I gave her a great line of dialogue. In 
the last line of the picture (now I find 
out t.h~t the producers put it in ahead, 
and 1t s no longer the last line), she says 
to him, "You're a bastard, and I'm a 
bitch." That's the whole flavor I wanted. 
I shot some great stuff. For instance, 
when the boat is sinking at the end he 
takes a lighted cigarette and throw~ it 
into the sea. I just stay on that cigarette. 
A fish sees it (the fish being a symbol 
of the ~hark), thinks it's something, and 
grabs 1t-pashht! That's the end of the 
picture. Now I think they've cut it out. A 
lot of things like that were cut out. 
As you know, I asked them to take 
my name off the damn thing, because 
I didn't like the cut I saw. I thought it 
was terrible. I told them I wanted to 
restore my origin4111, or I'd try to get my 
name taken off it. They said they didn't 
know if they could get the film from 
Mexico. They couldn't locate it. It was 
such a confused state of affairs. Finally, 
I told them, "Don't bother me about it 
anymore." It may be the world's worst 
picture, or it may turn out to be a sur-
prise to me. I don't know. I do know I 
had fun with the characters, because I 
went beyond the 411verage switch of 
revealing the villain. I also didn't have a 
guy just letting a girl go off to jail; he 
lets her be eaten up by sharks. I've 
never seen anything like that in a pic-
ture before. Have you? That's my end-
ing. That's what I shot. 
The only reason I first called the 
picture Caine is that we went to a res-
taurant in Mexico where the service was 
bad. I got sore, and while I was getting 
sore, I felt like Cain, so I said, "Well, 
we'll call it Cain." That's all. Hell. I felt 
like hell. Then the producer saw a lay-
out in Life magazine some pictures of a 
guy being killed by a shark or some-
thing like that, and it said, "Shark." So 
they changed the titlel 
Well, that's the checkered career of 
an ex-copyboy. That's "-30--"


**The Big Red One**
**Author: Samuel Fuller**

The Big Red One 
Future. Fuller's most cherished project. A 
treatment of the progress of the First Infantry 
Division in World War II. To be realized as 
both a film and a novel. 
My big love is The Big Red One. I think 
I've been working on it since the Second 
Battle of Bull Run. That's how long it 
seems. I want to shoot in seven coun-
tries. Seven countries, seven women, 
five men: that's the wf,ole story. It's a 
three-hour show. I don't think that's ask-
ing too much, because it starts out in 
Africa 411nd ends up in Czechoslovakia. 
It shows the beginning of a war. This is 
where my story begins: Who fires the 
first shot? How does a war actually 
physically start? War may be decla;ed, 
but, somebody has to kill somebody be-
fore it can begin. I go to the very last 
d411y of the war. This one man does not 
know the war is over. What happens to 
him is the really important thing in the 
story, because the verb "kill" becomes 
"murder." :;::
