W
E'RE LOOKING AT A CLASSIC MATCH-
up here, folks, and the stakes could-
n't be higher. Think Liston-Ciay but a 
whole lot sweeter-and glazier. On 
November 19, the Milford, Connecticut, 
donut world will change forever. A brand 
new Krispy Kreme on Boston Pose Road is 
sec 
co square off against perennial 
favorite--and Boston Pose Road neigh-
bor-Dunkin' Donuts. The grand opening 
is part of Kreme's master plan to usurp 
Dunkin's worldwide donut hegemony. 

Kreme first established itself as a major 
player on the Connecticut donut scene 
with an October 8 opening in Newington. 
But with the Milford arrival, Krispy Kreme 
looks co cake one more geographical seep 
coward invading Dunkin's birthplace of 
Quincy, Massachusetts. Donut aficionados 
will be carefully watching the Milford bat-
tle. Ac stake is the eventual control of the 
New England Markee. I talked to a handful 
of nervous employees from the cwo fran-
chises, and though both sides cried co 
downplay the significance of November 19, 
ic's clear: They're hungry for victory. 

Krispy Kreme may have Southern 
charm on ics side, but Dunkin' Donuts has 
tradition-not to mention home-field

advantage. Connecticut is Dunkin's territo-
ry. And Bill Rosenberg is the president. 
Rosenberg, Dunkin's founder, waS already 
peddling his casry dough on Boston Pose 
Road before Krispy Kreme even thought 
about selling its first donut in New Orleans 
in 1937. Dunkin' has been a New Haven 
mainstay for generations. 

Some of 
Rosenberg's first employees were Yale stu-
dents, and there are 54 Dunkin' Donuts 
within a ten mile radius of campus. The 
global numbers are even more daunting: 
Dunkin' Donuts has more than 3,500 shops 
in the United Scates, and over 5,000 world-
wide. Krispy Kreme doesn't even have that 
many employees. 

Kreme may be the scaciscical under-
dog, but remember, Dunkin' had a big 
head start. It wasn't until the mid 1980s that 
Kreme expanded out of the Southeast. 
Their fresh go-gee-' em swagger gives them 
an outside shoe at an upset. And chen 
there's che secret recipe. In 1937, culinary 
entrepreneur Vernon Rudolph convinced a 
gullible French chef co give him the blue-
prints for his deliciously addictive yeast-
raised donut. Today, we call this donut the 
Hoc Original Glazed. Just how good is ic? 
Krispy Kreme annually sells about the same 
number of doughnuts as its rival--even 
though it has 4,750 fewer locations. The 
things just taste beccer. 

In cerms of raw power, both franchises 
have a loc co offer. Dunkin' Donuts has 
fifty-two varieties of deep-fried goodness, 
along wich some of che best coffee in town. 
The coca! mass of Donuts coffee served in a 
given year is equal to more chan one mil-
lion African elephants. The kids ac Kreme 
may lack this imposing poundage, but 
they're a lot caller. In cwo minutes, Krispy 
Kreme carf produce a stack of donuts as 
high as the Empire State Building. 

Dunkin' Donuts has nothing chat 
compares to the Hoc Original Glazed. But 
Krispy Kreme isn't overconfident. In face, a 
lingering question remains as co whether or 
not the Kreme can compete with the 
Munchkins-Dunkin's donut holes. The 
Donut's donuts are made by hand, and for 
Â· every round donut produced, the excess 
middle is sold as a Munchkin. Kreme 
donuts, meanwhile, are made by pneumat-
ic machines chat mold the dough into the 
perfect 
donut 
shape-sans 
surplus. 

Munchkins have been a versatile weapon 
for Dunkin' Donuts in che past, and there's 
no reason to chink this will change. In face, 
Kreme seems to have a major hole in its 
game-plan unless it can address che 
Munchkin issue. 

Expect to see a poised Krispy Kreme 
coming out of the gates on November 19. 
Ac the Grand Opening, there will be magi-
cians and clowns-and what more can you 
ask for? A free giveaway? The fuse customer 
in line gets a year's supply of donuts; the 
first hundred get a c-shirc. But if Krispy 
Kreme wants to be successful in the long 
run, they'll have co convert legions of loyal 
Dunkin's patrons. 

Tuesday isn't just another day. It's a 
battle becween the old and the n~w, the 
established and untried, the champ and the 
contender. On February 25, 1964: a 22-
year-old Cassius Clay became boxing's 
youngest heavyweight champion when he 
creamed the venerable Sonny Liston. On 
November 19, history just might repeat 
itself
