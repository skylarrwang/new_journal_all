sions represent [a] standpoint equally in the interests of all." To 
deny that it is possible to overcome cultural struggles is to forsake a 
key democratic tenet: that communication and deliberation are 
possible among all members of a state. 

Conveniently, Benhabib's radical conception of culture con-
forms to this '~deliberative model" of democracy. Most people tend 
to consider cultures distinct, stable wholes. For instance, when we 
talk about the Pequot Indians, we refer to them as a group of peo-
ple that share certain core practices and beliefs. But Benhabib takes 
issue with this idea and stresses the instability and fluidity of cul-
ture, the moments when cultures are themselves riddled with con-
tradiction. She argues that cultures should be conceived of as 
unfolding processes, not static wholes. One can think of Judaism, 
with its myriad denominations, as an example of a culture that is 
driven by internal divisions. Jews not only argue with one another 
about their own customs and beliefs; they also consider themselves 
members of other cultural communities. In more philosophical 
terms, Benhabib says that the inherent fluidity of culture depends 
on two crucial factors: the human abilities to reason critically and 
to tell stories about oneself. Because we can critically evaluate cul-
tures and identify ourselves through complex "narratives," 
Benhabib thinks that cultures continuously undergo transforma-
tions. 

Appeals to cultural relativism mean little to Benhabib. 
\Ylhcther we admit it or not, human beings share a basic standard 
of communication. The "clash of civilizations" is just a myth, and 
theories popular among postmodernists of "untranslatability" and 
"incommensurability" between certain cultures are "impatient." 
How else, she asks, can we explain the fact that other cultures are 
even intelligible to us? As long as two people sit down and try to 
communicate long enough, she argues, they can eventually succeed 
in having a meaningful conversation. This sounds a bit like what 
Benhabib is herself paid to do, so couldn't this just be a self-right-
eous philosopher myopically privileging her own profession as the 
basic mode of social interaction? No, she counters, "all moral 
beings capable of sentience, speech, and action are potential moral 
conversation partners." This leads Benhabib to sum up this process 
of universal human communication in one deliciously iconic piece 
of jargon: "pluralistically enlightened ethical universalism on a glob-
al scale." 

With this complicated argument under her belt, Benhabib 
undertakes the central task of the book: to formulate an ideal con-
ception of democracy in which identity politics have a place but do 
not undermine the integrity of the whole. Her tone here is not so 
much that of a didactic philosopher, but of a conversation parmer. 
She casually weaves her model out of comparisons and contrasts 
with more than half a dozen other contemporary theories of democ-
racy. According to Benhabib, there are three necessary conditions 
for her brand of multicultural democracy to take root: "egalitarian 
reciprocity," "volunracy self-ascription," and "freedom of exit and 
association." The first means that minority groups must possess the 
same civil, political, and economic rights as the majority; the sec-
ond refers to an individual's right to assign his or her own identity; 
and the third indicates a person's right to enter or leave a cultural 
group at will. On their own, these "normative conditions" seem 
like common sense--who today does not subscribe to these 
beliefs?-but Benhabib radicalizes them by establishing them as 
basic rights of a democratic system that permits "maximum cultur-
al contestation within the public sphere." In other words, she con-
structs a model of democracy in which all citizens can freely and 
continuously debate any kind of question-be it cultural, political, 
or economic-in public. The idea is that if it is possible for every-
one to voice critical concerns and to participate equally in political 
and moral conversations, questions of multiculturalism can be 
resolved in such a way that leaves democratic principles of inclusion 
intact and also respects an individual's right to cultural distinctive-
ness-sort of a college campus built on a national scale. 

Under Benhabib's system of democracy, the "Affair of the 
Scarf" would not have been an instance of "clash of civili:z:ations," 
but an opportunity for critical debate and exploration of "other-
ness." Her system would have allowed the three girls to participate 
in a continuous, free, and open conversation about the scarves and 
negotiate a solution to the problem beneficial to all. They could 
have expressed their reasons for wearing the headscarves and thus 
legitimated their cultural practices through democratic means. 

Benhabib admits that there may be some extreme cases where con-
sensus may be so difficult to reach that secession may be warranted, 
but those exceptions would be few and far between. In theory, eth-
nic wars and terrorism would be things of the past. 

Benhabib is aware of the rosiness of her model. But, she con-
tends, "The fact that a normative model does not correspond to 
reality is no reason to dismiss it:" Ideal models of governmenr can, 
at the very least, help us to evaluate our current circumstances more 
effectively. Yet Benhabib is ultimately unclear about why she has 
bothered to construct an ideal democratic model at all. Is it to serve 
merely as a critical tool? Or can it actually pave the way for con-
crete socio-political change? Near the end of the book, she hints 
that her model exists neither for criticism nor for socio-political 
change, but rather for the sake of transforming assumptions. As she 
writes, "A great deal of contemporary debate on these [cultural] 
issues has been bogged down by false epistemological assumptions. 
Once these assumptions are rejected, new modalities of pluralist 
cultural coexistence can be reimagined." 

I cannot help but conclude, however, that Benhabib's vision-
commonsensical as it may seem--demands nothing short of all-out 
revolution. Her model of democracy requires a levelling of power 
in society, and that can only be accomplished by actively taking 
power away from those who have it. Yet what corporate CEO would 
agree to rational deliberation with protesters who believe that pri-
vate companies have too much control over politics? What head-
master would willingly agree that 15-year-old girls should have just 
as much a say in the management of a school as he does? Benhabib, 
unfortunately, supplies no guidelines for actually bringing about 
her vision, despite prescribing it as normative--the way things 
should be. Would she support a revolution? It is hard to say, 
though it seems unlikely considering that the most famous revolu-
tionsÂ· of the past century resulted in the utter disregard of culture 
and the deaths of millions. In this hesitation lies the most frustrat-
ing turn of The Claims of Culture. Afrer grounding so much of her 
careful, and often illuminating, argumentation in the concrete real-
ities of the world, Benhabib seeks the douds just when we need her ' 
most.
