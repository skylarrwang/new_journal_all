A FEW WEEKS AGO, I watched from a distance as an eclectic group 
of New Haven residents bearing homemade signs and banners 
gathered on the courthouse steps to file a war crimes indictment. 
T heir list of alleged war criminals included George W Bush, Dick 
Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and Colin Powell, and they were press-
ing for prosecution. 

A greying, unassuming man clad in stained and faded jeans and 
an old denim jacket addressed the crowd through a megaphone: 
"We are resisting and showing our protest to the ones in power!" 
Standing in rows on the courthouse steps, the participants clutched 
their ami-war banners in silence, scaring straight ahead solemnly 
and purposefully. Someone 
distributed 
copies of the 
indictment, with a list of the 
country's most powerful offi-
cials at the top and the 
Connecticut Peace Coalition 
of New Haven's email address 
on the bottom. In unison the 
group read the entire indict-
ment aloud. Then a few repre-
sentatives stepped into the 
courthouse to present the doc-
ument 
to 
Connecticut's 
Attorney General. "Now we'll 
see what they have to say," 
someone remarked smugly. 
There was applause and a hesitant chorus of"yays." 
"Sorry people," muttered a passerby stopping to glance up at 
the protesters. I frowned at him, but I didn't wholly disagree. 
Neither did I correct a friend who referred to them as "those cra-
zies." But at the same time, their stance against attacking Iraq mir-
rored my own. As the drumbeat for war had intensified over the 
past few weeks, I hadn't been able to shake the guilry feeling that 
students like myself had a role to play. Hasn't it traditionally been 
up to students to tile the scales to the left, to keep the government's 
hawkish tendencies in line? And if the protest movement was in fact 
my inherited duty, didn't I share some common ground with the 
protesters on the courthouse steps? 

A few days later, I took one of the white armbands that sym-
bolized my disapproval of war on Iraq. I dangled the frayed scrip of 
cloth from a strap on my backpack, carefully positioning it where 
my stance against the war would be visible-but not too visible. 

AT ONE OF THE COALITIONS TRI-WEEKLY STREET-cORNER vigils, 
Joan Cavanagh had taken up her usual post, solemnly distrib-
uting copies of the group's latest anti-war leaflet as fellow members 
stood behind her with a banner. A loose tweed coat dwarfed her 
slender frame; a red knit beret partly hid her shoulder-length grey 
hair. There was something resolute about her silhouette, as she 
extended her arm every time someone walked by. At forry-eight, 
Cavanagh is no stranger to the anti-war movement. She made her 
debut as a protester when she wa; active in her high school, then she 
dropped out of college after one semester to join a collective that 
was working against the war. She didn't go back to school until she 
was 29. "I actually have the pride of saying I was in prison on my 
21ST birthday," she told me. "Most of my friends were pretry cool 
with it. By that time they weren't surprised," she explained. "I had 
already been arrested 
six or seven times 
and had done jail 
time for 
it. 
My 
m other wasn't too 
happy; what can you 
say?" 

About 
twelve 
people 
constitute 
what 
Cavanagh 
termed the 
"core 
group," those who 
regularly come to 
the weekly coalition 
meetings. There are 
about 50 m embers 
who attend Coalition events, and the group's email list has about 
300 names. In four years, they haven't missed a Sunday on the cor-
ner of Broadway, Park, and Elm silently protesting sanctions, and 
now war, on Iraq. In the face of New England winters, hateful accu-
sations and-perhaps worst of all-passersby who don't even look 
up, what sustains such dogged resistance vigil aft:er vigil, week aft:er 
week? "I can't associate with the US government. I have to actively 
dissociate myself," Cavanagh cold me. "Silence is complicity," she 
continued, likening present-day protesters to Germans who resisted 
Nazi authority. "If everyone had capitulated at that time, what kind 
of hope do we have of the human race?" I winced. That's the kind 
of comparison that leaves a bitter aft:er-taste, that makes. eyes nar-
row at the thought that someone really had the nerve to say such a 
thing. It's the kind of analysis I'm quick to reject. 

One-by-one, Cavanagh handed out leaflets to anybody who 
would take one. She had already given out 100 leaflets in half an 
hour, she told me proudly. She knows many passersby do in fact 
read the flyers, she told me, because she often receives responses to 
them via email. Others clearly don't. A few people walked briskly by 
without looking up. "No thanks. Iraq. Hmmm ... See you guys 
later," said a man wallcing by. I wonder if those who refused the 
leaflet were wary of what didn't come from The New York Times, 
too wedded to the mainstream to ponder the possibility of their 
own indoctrination. Maybe like me, they've learned to parrot the 
opinions of those with d1e highest credentials and to second-guess 
the chorus from the margins that seems to culminate in a simple 
refrain: IfThe Government is behind it, it's corrupt, no questions 
asked. 

But my faith in the system is instinctive, not intellectual. 
Rationally, I realize that those doth banners are about individual 
issues more than subversion for its own sake; I believed one of the 
coalition's members, when he vouched that he doesn't "pick a side 
ahead of time," and I respected his and fellow protesters' willing-
ness to challenge what they read. But my fear of being a dissenter 
must die hard, for I secretly hoped no one I knew had seen me 
starlding beside Cavanagh, holding a piece of the anti-war harmer. 

IT WAS A SUNDAY AFTERNOON, and 14 people had shown up to 
protest on the corner of Broadway, Park and Elm. Cavanagh 
stood a few feet away, distributing flyers. Just across the street, a 
man dressed in an American flag costume and fiercely waving an 
enormous flag danced across his strip of sidewalk shouting against 
the cacophony of honking cars. "Saddam Hussein! He is a poach-
er! Let's kill him now!" he cried, addressing the anti-war protesters. 
"And you support him! USA!" The anti-war protesters glanced up 
at him every once in a while, but didn't budge. 

"It's a matter of increasing numbers," Joan said to me. "As the 
numbers increase, the impact increases." So the government really 
notices? "They hear it," she said. "They know it's out there." When 
it comes to protesting, numbers make a dual statement, directed 
both at the government and at the people. "I feel there's a lot of 
people [who) unfortunately need reassurance that they're not the 
only ones who are against what George Bush is plarming," said a 
Coalition member named Paula, a freelance writer and poet. She 
hopes to provide that reassucar1ce, she explained, by "starlding out 
in the street corner with the signs and slogans they have in their 
hearts but they're not ready to show." A lot of people thank her for 
what she's doing, she told me. "I say, 'why don't you join?' They say, 
'well I'm glad you're doing it.'" I shook my head in disapproval, at 
the same time fully recognizing that she'd described me to a T. I 
resolved to change. 

THERE'S SOMETHING EXHILARATING ABOUT CROWDS, especially 
when they number in the hundreds of thousands like the one in 
Washington, oc, a few weeks after my initial encounter with the 
Coalition. "There's no power like the power o' th' people 'cause the 
power o' th' people don't stop, say what?" I was jumping up and 
down as I shouted with the crowd. "This is what democracy looks 
like! That is what hypocrisy looks like!" we cried gleefully, pointing 
from ourselves to the White House beside us. It was a celebration 
of the First Amendment. As far as you looked, all you could see 
were protesters and their signs. For a few hours, I believed we were 
a force to be reckoned with; I believed in "the power o' th' people" 
and "what democracy looks like." We were living it. Maybe that's 
how the coalition members felt when they delivered the indictment 
to the State Attorney General and sat back to wait for the trial to 
begin. I wondered how I'd once mocked the cardboard signs of the 
Connecticut Peace Coalition and marveled that it had taken me so 
long to truly comprehend the power and the imperative of resis-
tance. "The people! United! Will never be defeated!" we shouted 
rhythmically, and I believed it. It was my job to put that truth into 
action. As the numbers increase, the impact increases. And silence 
is complicity. 

In the middle of the day, swept up in the anti-war fervor, I 
removed my white armband from its inconspicuous position on my 
backpack and asked a friend to tie it around my arm. 

But the magic was fleeting, and shortly after my return, the 
torn piece of cloth was relegated to my desk drawer with a promise 
to retie it that I have yet to fulfill. In fact, the protest at the capitol 
already feels like a distant memory. A Yale student and Coalition 
member I befriended on the bus to DC asked me afterward if it I 
would attend more large-scale protests like it. I didn't have to pause 
much to answer in the affirmative, and I haven't changed my mind. 
I guess I have no trouble protesting when thousands of people 
around me are doing it too. 

Yesterday, I attended one of the Coalition's street-corner vigils 
for what might have been the last time. That day's banner read "No 
us Military in Iraq." I couldn't agree more wholeheartedly. And I 
don't think they're a bunch of"crazies." I respect their conviction of 
their own accountability in us foreign policy, their courage in chal-
lenging the mainstream, and their determination to display their 
resistarlce to the people and the government person by person, week 
after week. I considered volunteermg to spend a few mirlutes hold-
ing up a corner of their worn, cloth banner. But after hanging 
around for a few mirlutes, I decided against it and lefr.
