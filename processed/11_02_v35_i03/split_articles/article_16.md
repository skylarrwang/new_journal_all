and clean policies against Avila. With plenty of community discontent to marshal to its purposes, City Hall made a convincing case. 
But the hands of the city administration and its allies stopped looking so clean in late October, when two well-known supporters of the mayor were arrested for absentee ballot fraud in the elections for Democratic ward chairmanships last March. That race pitted Menen Osorio-Fuentes, a staunch Avila-Diaz backer and president of the board of the FHDC, against the sister of Angelo Reyes, a staunch DeStefano supporter and one of the men later arrested for tampering with the ballots. Reyes's green pick-up truck, which is often blazed with DeStefano For Mayor signs in campaign seasons, is a common sight on the streets of Fair Haven, where he is a successful private developer and energetic community activist. He has made no secret of his opposition to Diaz and Avila's policies or to the PHDC. 


Just hours after Reyes and Yale senior Michael Montafio were arrested for tampering with absentee ballots, the properties went up in flames. So far, police and fire officials have offered no specific answers. But the Avila-Diaz camp was quick to insinuate a direct connection between the events. They charged that Reyes, who was once convicted of selling cocaine on the same streets where he now builds new homes, was behind the vandalism-retribution Fair Haven style. 


Were the fires the result of arson? If so, were the culprits local thugs seeking revenge for the arrest of Reyes and Montafio? Or could the attacks have been a sham perpetrated by supporters of Avila and Diaz in order to gain political sympathy and collect insurance money for the FHDC, as some others allege? The raise uneasy questions for Fair Haven, where political battles resemble guerilla warfare and margins of victory are often razor-thin-and often have little to do with outcomes at the polls. 


RAFAEL RAMOS HAS A DRAWER FULL OF POLAROIDS to show how disgusting the Fair Haven buildings that he visited as a building code inspector used to be. For Ramos, these photos show how far the neighborhood has come thanks to the hard work and growing influence of the Mayor, even at the expense of local leadership. The photos show condemned houses with sagging roofs, teenage boys brandishing their shotguns, mammoth piles of trash, a basement spotted with feces. One shows an apartment with a bar across the door. "That's a drug house," Ramos explained, sitting in his office at the Livable City Initiative (LCI), an urban improvement agency begun by DeStefano in 1996 and housed in City Hall. "They do that with bars on the door." 


Most of the pictures were taken in 1998 or earlier. Code violations still abound, said Ramos, but things are not nearly so bad these days. "Do we still have violence and derelict houses? Yes, but not to the same magnitude," he explained, flipping through the photographs ruefully. He, of course, gives much of the credit to Mayor DeStefano's administration. Avila and Diaz, in contrast, scorn outsiders and intimidate residents into submission-a power play that, according to Ramos, only isolates a community in great need of help. "They are not establishing relationships with the community. They're not leading by example," he said. 


When City Hall began its push for a change of political leadership in Fair Haven, Ramos was among those to answer the call. "We haven't done it until now. We have new grassroots leadership in Fair Haven who can partner with the city and non-profits. The momentum is there and it feels good," he said. 


But Ora Lee Dortshe points out exactly where the momentum stops: in front of her house on Chapel Street, where a repaved sidewalk abruptly ends. She is among residents who dispute Ramos's claim that the Mayor's leadership has delivered widespread benefit to Fair Haven. Starting there, the pavement is still filled with weeds and gaping holes. She thinks she knows why: It is "because of my big mouth," she says. Dortshe loudly opposed the Mayor's River Street development plan and the opening of a new restaurant across from her house. And she makes no secret of where her political sympathies lie-with her alderman and neighbor, Raul Avila. 


On a drive around her neighborhood, Dortshe points out other sidewalks that have not been redone and houses abandoned to the onslaught of winter and age. These disparities, she believes, are an effort by DeStefano's allies to punish those who have continued to support Avila--or, as Dortshe would put it, stand up for local sovereignty. 


People from outside of Fair Haven, according to Dortshe, do not understand what the neighborhood needs. Development projects originate in City Hall, among city employees who hail from outside the neighborhood. Dortshe repeatedly demanded promises that local contractors would be used in the River Street project, that minority businesses would be brought in and neighborhood residents employed. "People want to own their own homes they can be proud of. They want to do what other people do," she said, driving up Wolcott Street. "All of a sudden everyone's coming into Fair Haven. This one wants it, that one wants it. Suddenly everyone's talking about Fair Haven on the news. What are they talking about? Are they talking about those kids down there?" she asked, gesturing to a group of kids playing Halloween pranks down the block. 


What city hall is doing, she notes, is holding political grudges against her alderman Raul Avila and making sure he cannot accomplish anything on behalf of his constituents, preferring to install outside interests instead. 


But increasingly Dortshe feels the futility of her opposition, and resignation has begun to creep in where vitriol and persistence once earned her enemies. "After a point you just say the hell with it," she said. "They're going to do it ... They're going to do whatever they want."
