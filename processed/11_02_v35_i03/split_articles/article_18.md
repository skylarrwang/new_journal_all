HAVE BUTTERFUES IN MY STOMACH," Charlie Pillsbury tells us, 
smiling hopefully as he guides his bicycle into the street. In spite 
of his silver beard, khaki shorts, and bike helmet, he speaks to the 
cluscer of reporters and carries himself in a way that reminds me of 
Gregory Peck playing Atticus Finch in To Kill A Mockingbird. The 
four of us accompanying Charlie on the ride finish stretching, eager 
to begin. Swinging our legs over the bicycle frames and settling into 
our toe clips, we merge with the main street traffic on our way 
down the Connecticut coast. 

It is a perfect fall day. We bike by small pastures and crumbling 
stone walls. The leaves on the maples .and oak trees are just begin-
ning to turn, and the shade they provide has a mottled, rosy warmth 
to it. We bike for miles without word or rest. Lulled by my enjoy-
NoVEMBER 2002 
ment of the soft hills and scenery, I almost forget we are riding for 
another purpose. With 25 days until the election, Charlie Pillsbury 
is campaigning to win a seat in Congress. A victory would make 
him the most powerful Green Party politician in the nation, and as 
a candidate, Charlie has a unique appeal. He has worked for 30 
years in New Haven, the largest city of the congressional district, as 
an attorney, an advocate for the homeless, and the director of a 
community mediation center. He can even claim some degree of 
national name recognition: His great grandfather founded the 
Pillsbury Company, and college roommate Gary Trudeau modeled 
Mike Doonesbury, the lead character of the Doon~sbury comic strip, 
on Charlie. And yet, there is something curious about this cam-
paign: Every one of us riding with Charlie knows he has no chance 
of winning. 

Even for a candidate who is unknown, inexperienced, and out-
spent, there is one last-ditch populist ploy that can turn the tide: the 
campaign tour. After all, well-run campaign tours have been 
responsible for some of the biggest electoral upsets in American his-
tory. In the 1948 presidential election, every poll, every journalist, 
and even Harry Truman's own wife predicted that Thomas Dewey 
would beat him by a landslide. After a 22,ooo-mile whistlestop 
campaign tour with hundreds of speeches from the back of his 
train, Truman eked out a victory. In 1992, a relatively unknown gov-
ernor from Arkansas upset a war-hero president after a media-fren-
zied bus tour across the country. 

In this tradition, Charlie is setting qut on a 5-day, 16o-mile lis-
tening tour through all 25 towns in the district on his royal blue 
Schwinn 'Traveler' Io-speed bicycle. Seemingly unaware of how 
perfectly the tour fits most people's stereotype of the hopelessly 
nai"ve Green, Charlie proudly calls this his "good, Green Party idea." 
He and his campaign team have planned a number of press events 
and meetings with community leaders along the way. But in 
American politics, it isn't easy being Green: In the 18 years since the 
party was founded, no Green Party candidate has ever won a seat in 
Congress on the national or even state level. Moreover, the incum-
bent, Rosa DeLauro, is the second-highest-ranking Democratic 
woman in the House of Representatives. Seeking her 7TH term in 
office, DeLauro has raised more than six times the campaign money 
Charlie has. So why did Charlie agree to enter a political race he 
almost surely couldn't win? What ·was the purpose of this seeming-
ly quixotic tour? I wondered if the Green Party had a prayer of ful-
filling their promise to, "regenerate grassroots democracy in 
America." The only one to respond to posters that Charlie had put 
up at Yale, I committed to join the tour for all five days to see if I 
could answer these questions.

A
T THE END OP OUR EXHAUSTING 40-
mile first day, dominated by a trip co a 
local high school, Charlie changes his 
clothes and has a quick bite to eat before 
going co "candidate's forum night" at Notre 
Dame High School. Although he knows it 
is more productive to spend his time with 
people old enough to vote, Charlie can't 
rum down an opportunity to talk co kids. 
"When you hit your mid sos, you begin to 
realize your days are numbered. I wane co 
pass on the ethic of political engagement 
my parents taught me," he says. The dining 
hall of this all-boys Catholic school bas 
been converted into a small lecture space, 
and local candidates are giving short 
speeches and answering questions from the 
75 or so students in the room. Richter Elser, 
the Republican candidate, has shown up, 
but DeLauro is absent. Charlie ,....------::: 
begins his talk with a question, 
"Who was the last third party can-
didate to win the presidency of the 
United Stares?" "Roosevelt!" one 
boys yells. "Washington," says 
another. "No, nobody ever did 
that," a third boy responds. 
"Abraham Lincoln," Charlie says, 
"When he was elected, 
the 
Republican Parry was a new third 
parry, after the Democrats and the 
Whigs. You've got to stare some-
where, right?" This last thought is 
a source of comfort for Green 
politicians, who happily point our 
and meetings. The most important stop of 
the day is at the Pratt & Whitney aircraft 
manufacruring plane in North Haven. The 
old brick building is a single massive room 
with row upon row of humming ceiling 
lamps. Below, heavy machinery lies in scat-
cered piles, and mountains of metal cabi-
nets, workbenches, and chairs are arranged 
in rough aisles. The plant closed a year ago, 
and today is the first of a two-day liquida-
tion sale. Anything that isn't sold will be 
dumped in a landfill, the sale manager tells 
me. 

Charlie is here to meet with Kate 
· Greco, the widow of a Pratt & Whitney 
employee who died two years ago of 
glioblastoma multiform, an aggressive 
brain tumor that strikes fewer than three 
in xoo,ooo people each year. In March,

HE DRIZZLE THAT BEGAN on the after-
noon of the first day has kept up for 
the whole night and continues into the 
morning of the second. The sky is slate gray 
and the streets are spotted with puddles. 
The rain is forecast co continue throughout 
the day. Our hostess for the first overnight, 
a 90-year-old woman who used co baby-sic 
AJ Gore in Tennessee, shakes her head as we 
busde around the house. 'Td wait until next 
week," she says, "the only message that will 
gee sent today is that it is cold and wee." 
We leave anyway and have our busiest 
day of the whole tour, full of press events

group called Worked to Death for the fam-
ilies of the victims and employees of P&W. 
As reporters from four Connecticut news-
papers crowd to listen in on Charlie and 
Ms. Greco's conversation, Charlie says, "It is 
impressive to me that Ms. Greco has rurned 
her private grief into a public service. She's 
a hero." "Thank you,"' she says quiedy, 
keeping her eyes fixed on the ground in 
front of her. One reporter asks Charlie, "Are 
you going co take any sore of stand on this 
issue? Is there anything you can do as a can-
didate?" He looks pained for an instant 
before tactfully ducking the question by 
explaining instead what he would do if

elected. 

One of the central claims of the Green 
Parry is that, by virtue of its independence 
from corporate sponsorship, its candidates 
are more inclined to tackle local problems 
and protect individuals. And yet, with a 
few 
minor exceptions like 
Michael 
Feinstein, the mayor of Santa Monica, 
California, Green politicians have been 
unable co get into important offices. So, 
while getting four reporters to cover this 
story is a start, as a Green who almost cer-
tainly won't win the election, Charlie is as 
powerless to help as anyone else. 

O
VER BREAKFAST ON THE THIRD MORN-
ING, we discuss the different methods 
we each used to dry our shoes the night 
before. In my exhaustion, I had for-
gotten to do anything, and Charlie 
is a little worried about my feet. 
They are a translucent pale color 
and puffy from the full day in 
waterlogged tennis shoes and are 
now unhappily stuffed in the same 
soaking sneakers. Minutes later, 
though, we are all suffering equally: 
It is steadily raining again. No press 
conferences or meetings are sched-
uled for the third day. Paul and 
Dave, Charlie's staffers, explain that 
many labor and community groups 
won't meet with Charlie because 
they need to remain loyal to 
DeLauro and the Democratic 
Party. So Charlie plans to make 
stops wherever he can fmd a group of 
potential voters, a task made much more 
difficult by the rain. 

Our first stop is at a behemoth shop-
ping center outside of Waterbury. We 
spend a few minutes waiting outside of the 
electric doors of a Sears store, but the few 
customers not enjoying their Saturday 
morning dry and at home seem co live out-
side the district, so we move on. Several 
miles later, we stop to use the restrooms in 
Roller Magic, a roller rink in downtown 
Waterbury. Charlie introduces himself co a 
group of parents standing by th~ edge of 
the rink. watching their kids skate. He dis-
covers that they are from Watertown, not 
Waterbury, and are thus just outside of the 
3RD district. Across the room, Dave is 
changing dollars into quarters to play air 
hockey. "Come on, Dave," Charlie shouts 
with an edge to his voice I haven't heard 


T IS NOT SO MUCH THE INTENSITY that is 
impressive, but the persistence of the 
downpour that greets us for the third day 
in a row. Incredibly, it is still raining on the 
afternoon of the fourth day of the tour 
when Mark Kurber, a tall man in a plaid 
shirt and work pants riding a dirt bike, 
joins us as we pass through Ansonia. Mark 
hesitates a moment and asks, "Isn't 
DeLauro a pretry liberal Democrat?" 
Charlie doesn't miss a beat in responding, 
"Well, liberal on issues like labor and the 
environment, but not on war or universal 
healthcare. She voted well on Bush's resolu-
tion, but hasn't committed to preventing a 
war against Iraq. We need to keep pushing 
her on that." But despite Charlie's pat 
answer, Mark's question cuts to the heart of 
anti-Green sentiment in the liberal ranks-
a charge closely related to its reputation as 
a "spoiler parry," especially after Ralph 
Nader tipped the election away from the 
Democrat Al Gore in several key states in 
the 2000 election. In this case, the minimal 
support for the Republican candidate 
means that there's almost no chance 
Charlie would play the same role. But the 
question stands: Wouldn't progressive vot-
ers have more success in trying to influence 
the DemocFatic parry from within rather 
than trying to challenge it from without at 
the risk of throwing elections altogether? 

Recently, Charlie's supporters have been 
giving him credit for DeLauro's decision to 
voce against President Bush's Iraq war resolu-
tion. Charlie himself has pointed out several 
times to reporters along the tour that he has 
gotten DeLauro to debate twice already even 
though she had only debated twice before in 
twelve years of office. Forcing the Democrats 
to the political left and raising neglected 
issues are valid objectives for a liberal third 
party, but for many left-of-center voters, 
these benefits come at too high a cost. 

E
ARLY IN THE MORNING ON THE LAST 
DAY, we meet in front of the Audubon 
Sociery's Research Center on Milford 
Point. The rising sun reflects gold and 
green off the water and the tall grasses of 
the protected salt marsh surrounding the 
building. After three days of relentless rain, 
the sky is clear, and the roads are dry. It is 
still cold, but we are so glad to see the sun 
that no one complains. 

After lunch, several more supporters 
join us, and we are 15 strong as we walk our 
bikes across the New Haven Green. Large 
tents are clustered on one side, and people 
are stretched out in the sun. This makeshift 
commune, called Tent Ciry, has been hous-
ing between 40 and 110 homeless people 
since the overflow shelter was closed a 
month ago. 

Charlie walks up to a group of men 
standing by the tents and asks them what 
he can do to help. "We need water," the 
man says, "and some warm clothes. It's 
been raining for three days straight and 
there's a bunch of us that have gotten cold." 
Charlie finds one of the men in charge of 
the communiry and gives him $20 to get 
water. He confers with the rest of the bik-
ers and returns, promising to bring blan-
kets and warm clothes at the end of the day. 
I notice that Charlie hasn't introduced 
himself to the men, much less given them 
the stock greeting he used with virtually 
everyone else on the tour. Doing practical, 
hands-on work to help these people, the 
communiry mediator in Charlie has taken 
over, submerging his political aspirations. I 
have not seen him so at ease since he met 
with the students on the first day of the 
tour. 

As we pull into the empry parking lot 
of the campaign headquarters, we ride in a 
wide circle before coming to a stop. 
Standing by our bikes, we look silently at 
each other for a few seconds, and then 
everyone begins to smile and laugh. We 
exchange long hugs, in which, if only for a 
moment, we forget that Charlie won't 
win--or at least realize that winning was 
never really the point. 

On election day, Delauro took 66% of 
the vote, Elser 28%, and Pillsbury 5%.
