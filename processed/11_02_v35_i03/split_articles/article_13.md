that it would cause the type of sensation 
that it did. I never dreamt that President 
Levin or the others would take it as an 
insult." 

The idea for Lee's candidacy originat-
ed among local pastors active in the 
Connecticut Center for a New Economy 
(ccNE), a local union-affiliated research 
and advocacy group. Lee is vice president 
of its governing board. The Reverend 
Lillian Daniel, the CCNE board's president 
and a YDS classmate of Lee, claims that the 
idea was never centered around Lee or the 
organization specifically. "His candidacy 
came up out of friendships among the local 
clergy, not through our organization," she 
explains. The idea was that one of them 
ought to run for a corporation seat, testing 
Yale's commitment to partnership with 
rankled some prominent alumni and cur-
rent members of the Corporation were 
Lee's financial ties to Yale's labor unions, 
who had paid for his S30,ooo petition-
drive mailing. Lee jumps to justify accept-
ing the donation: "How does a no-name 
pastor get a name out to all these alumni?" 
he asks in his own defense. ''I'm the pastor 
of a black congregation in New Haven, and 
I'm not personally wealthy, and so I had to 
go to those who would believe in this idea. 
The unions felt, hey, let's try this. And it 
was no strings attached." 

Others disagreed, seeing an aggressive 
adversary in Lee rather than a potential 
partner. Kurt L. Schmoke, former mayor of 
Baltimore and the Corporation's first 
Mrican-Arnerican Senior Fellow labeled 
staid process with his overt campaigning 
and failing to meet the high standards of 
achievement normally required for entry 
into the august governing board. In a rare 
public statement about the election, Levin 
said in an apparent dig at the young 
Dixwell preacher that "with an alumni 
body of I20,ooo, we should look for candi-
dates who are extremely accomplished in 
their fields." 

As the months wore on, the campaign 
that was ostensibly not about David Lee 
became more and more overtly personal. 
The AYA launched a website to inform 
alumni about the two candidates. Printed 
side by side with comments from Lin about 
her enthusiasm to serve the Yale communi-
ty were comments from Lee promising to 
To hear lee talk, vou'd

with one mark in the loss 
the community. Lee sums up the rea-
soning: "When you only have these 
wealthy corporate interests on the 
board and never have input from the 
level of the constituency you're in a 
partnership with, there's no room for 
that constituency's self determination. 
And that's essential for you to be 
received and respected in a host com-
munity where most people still live in 
poverty." Lee was chosen to run as the 
voice of that muted constituency. The 
Corporation controls Yale's endowment-
the $11 billion that Lee would like to see 
distributed in part back to the community. 
A seat on the Corporation would hardly 
give him free access to the money. Lee 
knows that his would be only one of 18 
votes in the board's decisions-not exactly 
a 
mandate 
for 
sweeping 
change. 
Nevertheless, he contends, having that 
community input could bring some issues 
to light that others might never have con-
sidered. 

"preserve the best interests of Yale 
University" as well as more adversari-
al soundbites. "Levin is probably 
laughing now, but he won't be laugh-
ing when we get there," read one. 
Another declared that "Yale has met 
its Waterloo in the Federation of 
Hospital and University Employees. 
Using the rarely-invoked process of 
nomination by petition, Lee got his name 
on the ballot for the 2002 election of an 
alumni fellow for the Corporation with 
over 5,ooo alumni signatures supporting 
his run. Most years, candidates for the 
vacant alumni seat are nominated by a 
selection committee chosen by the 
Association of Yale Alumni (AYA). This 
unorthodox method was not what generat-
ed the controversy, however. A number of 
alumni had used it in the past, including 
Wtlliam Horowitz, who became. the 
Board's first Jewish member in 1969. What

Lee's bid "a mirage campaign, initiated by 
national labor organizations intent on gain-
ing ground on the campuses of private uni-
versities." University spokesman Helaine 
Klasky called Lee's tactics "unsavory," say-
ing, "If you're collecting so much money 
from the unions, you must be promising 
these people something." 

As the controversy brewed, the official 
AYA selection committee nominated only 
one candidate-architect Maya Lin, 
designer 
of the 
Vietnam 
Veterans 
Memorial in Washington-to oppose Lee 
in a not-so-veiled effort at stacking the 
deck. (Normally a slate of three to five can-
didates is proposed.) An alumni committee 
led by former University Secretary Henry 
"Sam" Chauncey began to publicly protest 
the "special interest campaign," taking on 
Lee's supporters in a battle played out in 
special advertising sections . of the Yale 
Alumni Magazine and on the opinion page 
of the Yale Daily News. The campaign 
focused primarily on Lee rather than Lin, 
who stayed above the fray and did not talk 
to the press. Lee's supporters challenged the 
University to live up to its rhetoric. His 
detractors accused him of "corrupting" the


It is indeed our time!" In May, an 
article in the 
Washington 
Post 
summed up the general feel of the 
campaign as it wound to a close: "There are 
those at Yale University who firmly believe 
that the Rev. W David Lee is a dangerous 
man .... privately, they belittle him as ambi-
tious yet insignificant, a nobody and a 
spoiler, a puppet of dark forces bent on 
soiling their shining city on a hill." 

By the time the ballots were finally 
cast, the AYA had spent $65,000 on mailings 
sent to clear ue the confusion of any Yale 
alumni who may have assumed that Lee 
had the group's endorsement. Chauncey's 
committee had spent $8o,ooo in a direct 
effort to defeat him. Lee's side, by contrast, 
had spent only $55,000, $30,ooo of which 
went towards the initial mailing. Despite 
the disproportionate spending, many 
thought David still had a good chance of 
slaying Goliath. The controversy had gen-
erated far more free publicity than he ever 
could have dreamed of receiving, and his 
campaign themes were thought likely to 
strike a sympathetic chord with alumni 
who had graduated in the last two decades, 
when New Haven's fortunes were ac their , 
lowest. Goliath, however, withstood the 
challenge: David Lee lose by a vote of 8,32.4 
to 45,575.
