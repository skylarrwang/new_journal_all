scious of humanity." That includes, among 
other things, shelving full sets of Buffy the 
Vampire Slayer books and multitudes of 
vanity press publications. But nowhere is 
Bernstein's description of a librarian's work 
more accurate, and its implications more 
meaningful, than in the library's collections 
ofThird World literature. 

For a librarian, every newspaper 
padding a garbage can is endangered litera-
ture. African collection curator Dorothy 
Woodson, for example, collects newspapers 
in over 500 African languages and puts on 
microfilm those too old to travel. With the 
steadfast goal of "preserving disappearing 
materials," she avidly collects what is 
known in the library world as ephemera. 
This includes posters, albums of non-pro-
fessional photos of South African and 
Zimbabwean ruins, stamps, pictures, and a 
rare treasure: a letter from Cecil Rhodes to 
his personal accountant. Africa's civil wars, 
with their way of tossing editors in and out 
of prison, make Woodson's work rather dif-
ficult. Yet she finds herself amazed at the 
"enormous amount of diverse scholarly 
materials." The books are thin and cheaply 
bound, made to be accessible to an often 
destitute readership--but, Woodson says, 
they are widely read nonetheless. 

Rich Richie, curator for the Southeast 
Asia collection, encounters a rather differ-
ent kind of ephemera. Aiming both to pre-
serve Cambodian printed materials and to 
bring copies of them to the West, the Yale 
Center for International Studies has recent-
ly helped establish a Cambodian Center of 
Documentation in Phnom Penh. There, 
Richie supervises the task of microfll.ming 
records from the Khmer Rouge for Yale's 
collections-quite a job, considering that 
there are no microfilm cameras in 
Cambodia, and reliable electricity can only 
be obtained from an imported generator. 
He describes the Center's Cambodian staff 
leafmg through records of Toulsleng, the 
regime's largest prison: Every so often 
someone would stumble upon the name of 
a family member, friend, or acquain-
tance--a concise record of death by 
starvation, unimaginable torture, or the 
brutal bareness of decade-long imprison-
ment. Richie also watches the documenters 
scanning the infamous "killing fields" for 
remnants of skeletons-a risky enterprise, 
since some of those places are still con-
trolled by Communist zealots.

Buying books can be just as interest-
ing. Richie describes with gusto open-air 
markets, where books are sold next to veg-
etables and household items. In Cambodia, 
the curator's place to be is the central 
Phnom Penh marketplace; in Thailand, 
large modern bookstores are common; in 
Laos, curators go to the government pub-
lishing office, the only one in the country. 
The books themselves are no less diverse. 
From comics (an important tool of govern-
ment propaganda) to modern reinterpreta-
tions of religious "literature and folktales, 
they tend to be published in tiny runs-
twenty-five copies is not rare-which can 
be taxing for the curator charged with 
keeping America's oldest collection of 
Southeast Asian literarure complete. 

Sometimes books are not published at 
all. Following a wave of student uprisings 
over a decade ago, Burma's universities have 
been closed, and academic publishing pro-
hibited. Richie resorts to collecting popular 
magazines published on newsprint, with 
black-and-white pictures. Occasionally he 
does get other texts at the out-of-print mar-
ket; but in doing so, he risks accidentally 
buying materials stolen from the country's 
National Archives-"people need the 
money," as he puts it. 

Cesar Rodriguez, curator for the 
library's Latin American collection, finds 
an "excellent" source of materials, particu-
larly on economics and human rights, in 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs). 
Those sprang up, he says, like mushrooms 
after the rain following the political tur-
moil that plagued much of Latin America 
through the 1980s. But most NGOS are 
funded by US and European institutions 
looking to promote Western ideals, an affil-
iation which can become problematic. 
Rodriguez, for example, "knew [he] was 
being followed" in Cuba while smuggling 
not-for-export books through the Swiss 
agency. Yet he managed to sneak out, on 
his person, flyers published by the Cuban 
statistics office containing figures on litera-
cy and poverty rates-by hiding them in a 
volume of Fidel Castro's speeches.
