Could a simple after-school program 
be the anslNer to a national epide111ic?

I uan Mendoza, a seventh grader at Fair 
U Haven Middle School, used to be fat. Like 
most overweight kids in middle school, he 
endured his share of taunting. But as much as it 
bothered him, he didn't know how to change his 
situation. "I used to just eat and not really care. I 
didn't know why I was eating what I was eating," 
he remembered. At the end of the school day, 
having skipped lunch and breakfast, Juan would 
hit the vending machines and stuff himself with 
unhealthy treats. On the way home local conve-
nience stores lured him in with the promise of his 
favorite snack: Doritos. At home Juan's family 
served him fried food; until last spring he had 
never even tried broccoli or cauliflower. 
But in the fall of 2001, all of that changed. 
For 16 weeks Juan and 20 of his peers participat-
ed in an after-school program designed by Dr. 
Margaret Grey, Assistant Dean of Research 
Affairs at Yale School of Nursing, and a team of 
colleagues. To Dr. Grey and her team, Juan is rep-
resentative of a national "epidemic of obesity" 
that has hit low-income and minority popula-
tions disproportionately hard. Though all of 
America is getting heavier as a result of reduced 
physical activity and poorer nutritional habits, 
socio-economic factors often determine who is 
most affected. It is a fact that the poorest people 
in this country are also the most overweight. 


In this regard, New Haven is a prototypical 
American city. Statistics highlight the gaping 
health discrepancies that exist nation-wide 
between upper- and middle-class citizens and 
inner-city dwellers. While approximately 16 per-
cent of American youth are obese, in New 
Haven, where 85 percent of students in public 
schools are either Mrican American or 
Hispanic, and the majority eat state-subsidized 
free lunches, the numbers hover between 45 
and 50 percent. 41 students participated in the 
16-week program at Fair Haven and Sheridan 
middle schools. All of them were considered 
clinically obese and all but one of them were 
either Mrican American or Hispanic. 
Yale psychology professor and obesity 
expert Kelly Brownell likens the weight crisis 
to the early days of the HIVIAios epidemic. 
"Obesity is somewhat like HIVI AIDS was in that 
it is a stigmatized problem and so despite its 
dire consequences the public is slower to 
respond," he explained. For the most part, 
poor people in America do not have access to 
healthy food, cannot afford physically active 
lifestyles, and live in communities where obe-
sity is commonplace. More troublesome, how-
ever, is the fact that obesity is the number one 
cause of Type 2 diabetes, one of the fastest 
growing diseases in America. In a statement 
issued last winter calling for changes in school 
lunch policies and the fast-food inaustry, 
Surgeon General David Satcher lamented, 
"The nation's obesity epidemic has gotten so 
bad it soon may overtake tobacco as the lead-
ing cause of preventable deaths." 


For Juan, the program presented an 
opportunity to improve his health, to stop 
being teased about his size, and to become an 
exception to the rule. A lot was at stake for Dr. 
Grey and her research team as well: If the pro-
gram, one of the first of its kind, could reverse 
trend~ towards obesity and, more imponandy, 
Type 2 diabetes in Juan and his peers, despite 
their home and school environments, then 
it could be a viable answer to a national 
problem. But success will depend on the 
program's ability to counter problems 
deeply engrained in American society. 
S
tatistically, Latino males between the 
ages of six and twelve like Juan have 
the highest incidence of childhood obesi-
ty-dinically defined by a ratio of height 
to weight above the 85th percentile. 
Childhood obesity has been linked to low 
self-esteem, altered body image, decreased 
preferences for physical activity, and 
depression. The most alarming problem, 
however, and the one that Dr. Grey is most 
worried about, is the direct connection to 
the early onset ofType 2 diabetes, a condi-
tion that impairs the body's ability to use 
insulin. As a result, fats and sugars are less 
effectively digested, causing high blood 
sugar levels. This can lead to reduced ener-
gy, high blood pressure, heart disease, and 
kidney disease. In 1980, only 2 percent of 
Type 2 diabetes cases occurred in children 
between the ages of nine and 19. Now that 
figure has jumped to between 40 and 50 
percent. The sharp rise in Type 2 diabetes 
in children is a troubling indicator of what 
is to come. "The problem here isn't only 
health related," explained Grey. "This 
health epidemic has huge societal implica-
tions. These kids will be suffering from 
complications in their 20s that we haven't 
generally seen until much later in life--and 
this doesn't have to be the case." But if the 
over-arching goals of Grey's course are of 
national significance, its classroom goals 
are surprisingly basic: nutrition, exercise, 
and coping skills. 


Juan remembers the beginning of the 
class as being extremely challenging. 
"Almost everything I learned was new and 
it was ha:rd to change the kind of food I 
ate." At the second session of the class, 'stu-
dents were asked to talk about the kinds of 
foods they consume and think of why they 
might choose those foods. While choosing 
foods based on taste, cost, and convenienceÂ· 
was familiar to the students, thinking 
about nutrition was not. High-sugar and 
high-fat foods are ubiquitous, regularly 
appearing in advertisements and promo-
tions, while messages about nutrition are 
more obscure. According to Brownell, "the 
economics of food are the reverse of what 
they should be. Unhealthy food is easy, 
cheap, everywhere, and tastes good." The 
students' diets at the beginning of the 
course reflected this. "Their diets were 
high-fat, high-carb and low-protein. They 
were drinking close to a liter of soda a day 
and didn't know that it was a problem," 
said Diane Berry, one of the primary 
researchers. 


During the first few weeks, the nutri-
tionist for the course, Pamela Galasso, tried 
to give the students tools and information 
that they could use when making choices 
about food. "I had to present them with a 
new way of talking to get them thinking 
about and actively participating in more 
meals," said Galasso. The approach Galasso 
used was holistic. Rather than focus on diet 
and weight-loss, she tried to emphasize 
small changes that students could make. 
She presented them with "culturally com-
petent" food guide pyramids that included 
foods that the students typically ate, such 
as rice and beans, and taught them some 
mnemonic devices to help them make deci-
sions about food. Among the devices were 
phrases like "DIET: Deprived Individuals 
Eat Too much"-a reminder not to skip 
meals-and "soDA: Stop Options Decide 
Act" -encouraging careful decision mak-
ing when choosing a beverage. Though 
these strategies may seem simple, for stu-
dents who didn't know that "four tennis 
balls" of rice was too much, they were wel-
come tools. Each week Juan made goals for 
the next week's class based on what he had 
learned: "Sometimes it was to add more 
vegetables or to eat some breakfast. I would 
try to eat less high fat food." The course 
gave Juan clear messages about food and 
nutrition-messages that were not often 
reinforced at home or at school. 


Unfortunately, processed, high-fat, 
and high-calorie food is just as prevalent in 
schools as it is in homes and stores. 
Students on subsidized school lunch pro-
grams do not have many options when 
choosing what to eat. School lunches, 
though fmanced by the government and 
required to meet certain standards, are 
often high in fat and light on fruits and 
vegetables. "The government policies are 
confused," explained Grey. "There are rules 
and regulations regarding school lunches. 
But in places like New Haven, where many 
of the meals are subsidized, the stuff they 
get free or cheap are the high fat choices."
