that in their view this organization is Raul 
Avila .... They insist on viewing us as iden-
tical to their political .opponents. Because 
they want to oppose and destruct their 
political opponents, they are doing the 
same to us." 

The FHDC relies on the city for the 
bulk of its funding, as well as for access to 
properties on which taxpayers have fore-
closed. While its investigation is on going, 
LCI will not act on FHDC applications for 
property or funding. ''At this point, I can't 
see giving them anymore money," said 
Rizzo. 

Because aldermanic elections are often 
decided by just a few hundred voters, 
neighborhood political battles are invari-
ably dose-fought, with neigh-
bor pitted against neighbor 
appeared justified. "We are no handwriting 
experts," Town Clerk Sally Brown recalled 
later, "but a blind person could see they 
were different signatures." The office 
passed the case along to the State Election 
and Enforcement Commission (SEBC). 

Around the same time, said SEEC Executive 
Director Jeff Garfield, the office received a 
complaint &om the United States Postal 
Service that "individuals were attempting 
to intercept absentee ballots." The SEEC 
launched an investigation last March in 
conjunction with the Chief State's Attorney 
Office and the Postal Service--yielding 
charges against DeStefano supporters Reyes 
and Montafio. 

The ballot fraud and fires, regardless 
of whether or not they are actually pinned 
Spanish-language weekly La WJz Hispana 
ran photos of the two men along with 
Menen Osorio-Fuentes, chair of the board 
of the FHDC and Avila's Wolcott Street 
neighbor, over the caption "La Trilog.(a del 
Mal" -or, "The Axis of Evil." "They are 
not the Taliban," the article conceded, "But 
their type of political action comes too 
close to fundamentalism." 

The most important criticism, howev-
er, comes in the form of a question to Fair 
Haven residents: When was the last time 
you saw your alderman? "Raul had an 
opportunity to really change the neighbor-
hood because he's Hispanic, because people 
believed what he said," said Angelo Reyes 
one afternoon, before his arrest. "They did-
n't provide. They did what they wanted." 

Magda Natal, who ran against 
Osorio-Fuentes in the ward co-
chair elections last March, sees 
and personal jabs circulated 
quickly through the commu-
nity. Fair Haven is no excep-
tion: Avila and Diaz's support-
ers accuse their opponents of 
betraying the Puerto Rican 
community to an Italian-
American mayor and his 
henchmen. The aldermen's 
detractors, meanwhile, have 
spread rumors that the two 
men threaten to pull Section 8 
"This is Fair Haven, not a 
banana republic. Raul is 
not the , big mob boss he 
thinks he is." 

Avila's 
domination of her · 
neighborhood waning. "I think 
a lot of people are starting to 
wake up to what he's done and 
what he hasn't done," she said. 

Opponents say that Avila and 
Diaz are ~ but invisible except 
at election time. Their absence, 
detractors claim, is indicative of 
their group's insular nature and 
preoccupation with maintain-
ing power, which translates into 
housing subsidies from voters 
who do not support them. What is clear is 
that leaders on both sides of the political 
divide have tried to harness and redirect 
the passions that inspire political disen-
chantment in many Fair Havenites. 

"There's a lot of uncertainty in people's 
lives and that translates into fear," 
explained Duffy Acevedo, Republican 
challenger for the 95TH district state senate 
seat and a past aldermanic opponent of 
Avila's. "They're dependent on government 
completely. For what purpose would they 
want to go out and take a chance at pissing 
someone off?" 

The alleged ballot fraud in the last 
ward co-chair elections show just how vul-
nerable small-scale city elections are to 
illicit dealing. After the co-chair election, 
Avila and the candidates he supported, 
Menen Osorio-Fuentes and Elba Franklin, 
brought in affidavits signed by more than 
half a dozen voters who said they had not 
signed their own ballots. When the ballots 
were checked, the charges of tampering 
on the Mayor's supporters, are only the lat-
est clash in a convoluted and contentious 
history. It has been a couple of years since 
critics began blaming Avila and Diaz for 
Fair Haven's stunted development. The 
accusations are manifold: Avila and Diaz 
have used their positions on city commit-
tees and the management team to block 
city funding for any organization they do 
not control. They threaten and intimidate 
Fair Haven residents who oppose them. 

They work on behalf of a narrow con-
stituency of family and friends whom they 
reward with political favors and promises 
of work and new houses. They use ethno-
centric politics to demand allegiance &om 
the Puerto Rican community. The evi-
dence, say the aldermen's detractors, is all 
around: in the blighted houses that could 
be refurbished homes, the drug deals still · 
taking place on the corner, the streets filled 
with holes, the throngs of kids loitering on 
the sidewalk for want of any safe place to 
spend the afternoon. Last spring, the 
limiting access to positions of leadership 
and curtailing the flow of information into 
the community. But there is a problem 
with this approach. "Ultimately informa-
tion cannot be controlled," said manage-
ment team co-chair Lee Cruz. And ulti-
mately, word of other strong-arm tactics 
gets out too. "They forget that for every 
one person you intimidate that's six people 
who are going to know about it-and that's 
exactly what happened," said Ramos. 

Certainly, the Devil's Night attacks set 
rumors flying immediately. One political 
opponent said it would be impossible to 
identifY suspects by tracking Avila and 
Diaz's enemies because "half the town" fits 
that description. The aldermen's supporters 
are quick to point out that Reyes has served 
time in jail for a drug-dealing conviction, 
and they claim that he maintains ties with 
local street thugs. 

Supporters of the aldermen claim that 
there are indeed signs of neglect-the 
neglect of City Hall and its loyalists. Mary 
Desmond, who ran scare senator Martin 
Looney's mayoral campaign against Mayor 
DeStefano in Fair Haven last fall, found 
veins of resentment towards City Hall ran 
deeper than Avila and Diaz's complaints: "A 
lot of people felt disenfranchised by the 
mayor's administration just because of the 
neglect. You had a core group of people 
who live here knocking on people's doors 
eight to ten hours a day and asking, when 
was the last time you saw a sidewalk go in?" 

TWICE IN THE LAST TWO YEARS, Avila 
and Diaz have clashed with other 
board members over the allocation of 
Community Development Block Grant 
money. In 2000, Avila, Diaz and Fair 
Haven's 
Ward-14 
Alderman 
Robin 
Kroogman blocked a grant to a Fair Haven 
Housing Initiative project supported by 
City Hall, instead securing another grant 
for their own agency, the FHDC. The battle 
lines were drawn again last year, when the 
Mutual Housing Corporation applied to 
do a development project at a site on Ferry 
Street. Avila twice delayed action on the 
proposals. 

When the issue came to a vote last 
May, Avila clashed angrily with Kroogman, 
leading her to try to have him ejected from 
the chambers. He has since sued her over 
the incident-a first in aldermanic history, 
according to board president Jorge Perez. 

Avila's actions at the May ninth meeting 
were the primary motivation behind 18 
aldermen's July request for an investigation 
into his conduct. 

Avila and Diaz further angered City 
Hall by voting against DeStefano's most 
recent budget, his first not to pass the 
aldermanic 
board 
with 
unanimous 
approval. Meanwhile, all three Fair Haven 
aldermen supported state representative 
Martin Looney in his primary campaign 
against the Mayor last fall. The Mayor's 
office in turn got behind Avila and Diaz's 
opponents in the last aldermanic race, and 
supported candidates running against their 
allies for control of the ward co-chairs and 
the management team. The 95TH district 
race provided an ideal opportunity to crush 
Avila and install a mayoral ally from across 
town and lay the groundwork for unseating 
Avila in the next aldermanic election. 

But regardless of which side has dirtier 
hands, Avila and Diaz have sacrificed their 
capacity for effective leadership by becom-
ing so adversarial towards City Hall. 

Community leaders who have worked with 
the aldermen say that a productive dialogue 
is difficult, if not impossible, in the face of 
their uncompromising opposition to inte-
gration into citywide deVelopment plans. 

THE 
GRAND 
AvENUE 
VENDoR's 
Association (GAvA) is a prime example 
of the need for such a dialogue between 
City Hall and local leadership. At their last 
meeting, some of CAVA's 54 members 
expressed frustration with the drug dealers 
loitering on the corner of Poplar and 
Grand. As a result, co-founder Norma 
Franceschi set up a meeting with the chief 
of police. Franceschi says GAVA often gives 
business owners leverage against negligent 
landlords by enlisting LCI on their behalf. 

The association's success in improving 
economic conditions on Grand Avenue is 
helping to attract businesses to Fair Haven, 
underscoring the benefits that can come 
from a working relationship with City 
Hall. Avila and Diaz say they agree that 
cooperation is important-but they want it 
on their own terms, a condition that GAVA 
clearly violates. Their bargaining position, 
unfortunately, is not too strong. As 
Desmond described the situation: "This is 
Fair Haven, not a banana republic. Raul is 
not the big mob boss he thinks he is." 

The divisiveness of the insiders-only 
rhetoric used by some of Avila and Diaz's 
supporters was on display at the town 
council meeting called to elect Martinez's 
successor. Despite the overwhelming sup-
port for Candelaria indicated three days 
earlier in a straw poll convened by former 
95TH 
District Representative Andrea 
Jackson-Brooks, Avila's supporters sharply 
rebuked those voting for the mayor's candi-
date. "Someone said you guys have to do 
what I say," Fuentes told the group. "This 
has to do with a vendetta by a certain elect-
ed official. Everyone should stand for 
themselves." 

The next night, Jackson-Brooks shook 
her head at the show of acrimony. "They 
basically called everyone there a puppet," 
she said. "You don't make friends and influ-
ence people by calling them names." Bret 
Bissell, executive director of the Fair Haven 
Housing Initiative, says he and other devel-
opers quickly tired of playing Avila and 
Diaz's games. Their philosophy on non-
profit funding for Fair Haven is clear, he 
said: "They would rather have it not come 
than not be in control of it." 

Yet for all the talk of a spontaneous 
wave of community opposition to a cor-
rupt and ineffectual leadership, the role of 
the mayor's office in catalyzing opposition 
is difficult to ignore. "The vote did not 
beat Raul. The machine beat Raul," Avila's 
Republican challenger Acevedo said before 
the election. "They chose to isolate Raul 
not because he's doing a bad job but 
because he won't work with them." 

Isolation in city politics, where every pro-
posal for funding or a new foundation has 
to go through a dozen layers of bureaucra-
cy, is akin to political impotence. "If he is 
ineffective, why? Because the city is shut-
ting him off," said Ward 14 co-chair Nancy 
Pascale, who was one of only five votes in 
support of Avila for the 95TH district nom-
ination. "Why do I have to be a puppet to 
get what I want for my neighborhood? 
That's not right." 

IN THEIR OWN DEFENSE, Avila and Diaz 
justify. their opposition to the mayor's 
development initiatives in the last four 
years as the result of a difference in philos-
ophy, rather than mere obstructionism. 

They claim that the mayor's proposals were 
drafted without the input of local officials 
and without the necessary understanding. 
of Fair Haven's needs. As the mayor's office 
demands stricter allegiance in exchange for 
its support, explained Diaz, aldermen have 
begun to forsake the long-standing tradi-
tion of deferring to the local politician on 
issues affecting his or her ward. Avila, Diaz 
and, until her recent change of political 
heart, Kroogman, have fiercely defended 
their turf. 

"I support government spending that 
fosters self-sufficiency and allows people to 
build wealth within their own communi-
ties," Avila said in an email shortly before 
Election Day. "I have used my influence to 
negotiate better outcomes on those projects 
that do not fit that definition." A big part 
of the problem is that some Fair Haven res-
idents, like Ora Lee Dorrshe, are deeply 
suspicious of outside efforts to develop 
their community. They see outside non-
profit organizations and Yale alumni as fly-
by-night reformers, interested in using Fair 
Haven as a guinea pig for their social devel-
opment projects without truly understand-
ing the community's complex social and 
economic dynamics. "If you are the direc-
tor of an agency, at 5 o'clock you get in 
your car and go back to your nice suburb. 
We're the ones here hearing the gunshots 
and seeing the traffic and the overcrowd-
ing," said Diaz. It is easy to direct this dis-
trust towards City Hall, especially given 
that three of the top officials in the mayor's 
current administration-Julio Gonzalez, 
Robert Smuts, and Henry Fernandez-are 
young Yale graduates. 

CERTAINLY, IT IS NOT HARD to perceive a 
double standard in City Hall's deci-
sions about when to blow the whistle. New 
Haven doles out over $7 million in devel-
opment money annually; with a finite pool 
of political players and plenty of red tape to 
obscure the mechanisms by which funding 
is allocated, scandal can be found in almost 
any corner. "It all depends who has the 
power and who they decide to attack," 
Diaz said. He points out that other housing 
development agencies have been found 
guilty of much more egregious mismanage-
ment; key mayoral supporters such as 
Johnny Martinez have been rewarded with 
top positions in City-run agencies; and 
many of City Hall's ground forces have 
been composed of people with question-
able backgrounds. 

It is City Hall's superior manpower, 
access to funding, and sway over local 
media that make renegade politics so 
untenable. Without the support of the 
mayoral administration and the agencies 
beneath its umbrella, development is all 
but impossible. Instead of assigning blame 
for the logjam, however, Fair Havenites 
would do well to concentrate on the best 
way to break through it-before any more 
of their neighborhood goes up in flames.
