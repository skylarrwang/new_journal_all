EVIL's NIGHT EARNED ITS NAME in Fair Haven this year. Near 
midnight on October 30, an empty barn on Wolcott Street went 
up in flames. A few blocks away, an abandoned home on James Street 
met the same fate. Across the neighborhood at a house on Lombard 
Street, a car slammed into the garage door, reversed, and sped away. 
The car too was later found consumed by flames. When the sun rose 
on HalJoween, both buildings and the car had burned to rubble; no 
trace of the fires' origins could be found in the smoking remains. 
The destruction was a bitter irony for Fair Haven, where a recent 
economic upswing has ushered in a spate of development venrures 
that have begun to rejuvenate an area once regarded as New Haven's 
immigrant slum. The fires themselves are likely the result of long-
standing conflict over what course this development should take and, 
more importantly, who gets to control it. During the last several years, 
the neighborhood's predominantly Latino residents have pushed back 
the drug dealers and gang members who used to rule the streets. 
Family-owned businesses and freshly renovated houses have cropped 
up on almost every block. On Grand Avenue, fJ Charco imports the 
makings for its traditional tacos all tbe way from Mexico. A fresh fruit 
stand crops up every morning in

ing war for control of Fair Haven's future. It is no coincidence that 
the targets of the attacks were two of Fair Haven's veteran repre-
sentatives on New Haven's Board of Aldermen, R."lul Avila and 
Kevin Diaz. The torched barn belonged to Avila, whose house 
stands in front of it; the vandalized garage was Diaz's. And just to 
make dear that the political connection between the events was no 
coincidence, the still anonymous vandals apparently targeted the 
James Street house because it was owned by the Fair Haven 
Development Corporation (FHOC), a nonprofit housing agency 
with close ties to the aldermen, who both sit on its governing 
board. 
The history behind the fires is long and bitter and has.,split 
Fair Haven into two camps, one allied with Avila and Diaz and the 
other closely tied to the powerful administration of Mayor John' 
DeStefano. Avila and Diaz have long used their positions to exer-
cise control over the neighborhood's development. Carping that · 
neighborhood improvement should always originate within the · · 
community, they demand that any outside group that wants to 
work in Fair Haven defer to their authority and operate through 
the network of businesses and nonprofit development agencies that · 
they control. But lately, DeStefano and his allies have charged rl}at 
Avila and Diaz have gone too far in their backroom manipulation 
and strong-arm politics. Last summer, DeStefano backed rival 
Democrat Johnny Martinez against Avila for state representative--
a slap ih the face for a veteran Democrat like Avila. When Martinez 
died in a car crash in October, DeStefano switched his support to
