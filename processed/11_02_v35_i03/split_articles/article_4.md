EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
ONE PALL DAY IN 1971, Neil Thomas Proto 
had an epiphany. It wasn't about God, or 
Vietnam, or flower power, or love. For the 
George Washington University law stu-
dent, studying the execution of two Italian-
American shopkeepers for robbery and 
murder in a Boston prison on August 23, 
1927, was an awakening. Proto recalls hear-
ing a few conversations about the case in a 
class and going to see a recently released 
film on the subject (the one with the Joan 
Baez soundtrack, he fondly remembers 
these days). Then he just knew: Nicola 
Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were about 
to change his life. When "Justice On Trial: 
Ben $hahn's Case For Sacco And Vanzetti," 
a collection of the modernist painrer's 
gouaches and tempera paintings accompa-
nied by historical photographs and film, 
opened at the Yale Art Gallery on October 
14 for a two month run, it was not only one 
of several events commemorating the 75TH 
anniversary of their deaths, but also the 
result of a one-man mission to bring Sacco 
and Vanz.etti to New Haven. 

When you talk to Proto, who tends to 
get hysterical when addressing the subject, 
it is hard not to feel like those dim memo-
ries from the annals of high school history 
are going to change your life as well. 
Though he now lives in Washington, DC, 
and works at a high profile law firm, Proto 
was born and raised in New Haven and still 
maintains a residence here. He has devoted 
the better part of his life to reading, study-
ing, and educating about the Sacco and 
Vanzetti case. In the process, he has con-
structed his own revisionist history of 
Sacco and Vanz.etti's story, become a collec-
tor of Sacco and Vanzetti-related folk 
music, and co-adapted an operetta-"The 
American Dream: The Story Of Sacco And 
Vanzerri" -which debuted at New Haven's 
own Shubert Theater this April. 

After that fateful day in 1971 when he 
first realized the spiritual, philosophical, 
and historical significance of the case, 
Proto hit the books. For the next two years, 
it got "a little intense." He spent months 
studying the eight volumes of transcripts 
and reading every work he could find on 
the execution. Finally, in 1996, Proto began 
4 
his magnum opus, a manifesto published 
in Italian Am~rica, the magal.ine of the 
national Sons of Italy, on the significance of 
the trial. But after publishing a second arti-
cle in 1997 for the 70TH anniversary of 
Sacco and Vanzetti's execution, Proto had a 
second epiphany: that the message was not 
getting out. So, after 27 years of devotion, 
he redoubled his efforts. "Why was this not 
talked about?" he remembered. "And what 
does it mean that it wasn't talked about?" 

Proto started talking to important 
people. He got on the phone with Mayor 
John DeStefano, Congresswoman Rosa 
DeLaura, and Yale Law School Dean 
Anthony Kronman to put together a sym-
posium that was the first phase in a mission 
to bring Sacco and Vanzetti to New Haven. 
He played on Yale's historic connections to 
the case--<:ountless articles in the Yak Law 
&vinu, petition drives by the YLS dean, and 
the advocacy of the Supreme Court Justice 
and then-Professor William L. Douglas-
and wasn't above drumming up a little 
Yale/Harvard rivalry over the issue either, 
like calling up the Mayor to suggest, "John, 
would you call the mayor of Boston to ask 
him what he is going to do to commemo-
rate the anniversary of Sacco and Vanzetti?" 

Slowly, he convened them to his idea of 
bringing Sacco and Vanz.etti to the city. 

Proto's crusade paid off. "I was just 
tickled," he recalls, "it was great fun, a 
merry experience." There were large 
turnouts at events like the gallery exhibit, 
the New Haven Colony Historical Society 
reading, and the "compose-your-own· 
Sacco-and-Vanzetti-folksong" 
evening 
sponsored by the Eli Whitney Folk Festival. 
Proto proudly remembers "a very bohemi· 
an crowd." And, the operetta played the 
Shubert to a sold-out crowd. 

If the exhibit's coming to New Haven 
started with Proto's epiphany, it is only 
appropriare: The art itself was the product 
of a full-blown religious experience. The 
painter Ben Shahn (a Jewish immigrant 
who arrived in the United States only two 
years before Sacco and Vanzetti) called his 
series of 32 modernist, distorted gouaches 
(8 of which are on display at che art gallery) 
and 2 tempera canvases "The Passion Of 
Sacco And Vanz.etti," in reference to the 
death of Jesus. Shahn explained his politi· 
cal art with an epiphany of his own: "Ever 
since I could remember, I'd wished thac I'd 
been lucky enough co be alive at a great 
time--when something big was going on, 
like the Crucifixion. And suddenly I real· 
ized I was. Here I was living through 
another Crucifixion. Here was something 
co paint!" 

For Proco, his own is as much a "great 
time" as that of Ben Shahn. "It's stunning 
how analogous it is to whac is going on 
today," 
he 
remarked. Although the 
THE NEW JouRNAL 


anniversary celebration was planned years 
in advance, the themes of anti-immigrant 
sentiment and criminal justice seem espe-
cially pertinent-a connection which 
exhibit curator Robin Jaffee Frank did not 
hesitate to acknowledge. Perhaps the year-
long commemoration is unlikely co inspire 
miracles. But did it change Neil Proto's life? 
·~solucely."
