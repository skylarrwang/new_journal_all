ON OUR CAMPUS, amidst a crowd of 
chanting, writhing students, a silver-haired 
octogenarian executes a series of martial-
arts kicks with the easy grace of a twenty-
five-year-old. I stand entranced by the 
spectacle before me. The student at my 
side, noting the look of awe on my face, 
mouths one word: capoeira. 

At the time, I thought that I had dis-
covered a new art form, something I could 
only explain as a mix between Kung Fu and 
break-dancing. But soon it seemed that 
everywhere I turned, someone knew some-
one who did capoeira. And it seemed that 
everyone who did it knew my silver-haired 
octogenarian, Professor Robert Thompson, 
aka Master T. 

Later that week, I met Master T in the 
Timothy Dwight dining hall, where it soon 
became clear that, given the opportunity, 
he could talk endlessly about almost any-
thing. All I had to do was utter the word 
"capoeira" to send him on a cultural jour-
ney back to Brazil, where African slaves 
developed the martial art as a secret form of 
rebellion. The words tumbled from his 
mouth so quickly that without the help of 
the TA eating next to me, I would have been 
completely lost. Not that Master T would 
have noticed. He seemed more intent on 
keeping himself entertained than helping 
me understand the popularity of capoeira 
at Yale. 

In twenty whirlwind minutes, he 
described the appearance of capoeira in the 
1980s in New York, when a lot of culture-starved 
yuppies mixed with the 70,000 Brazilians 
newly immigrated to the city. "Centers just 
shot up," he explained and jumped out of 
his chair. "Boom! Boom! Boom!" -the 
sound of capoeira exploding across New 
York City. 

Despite capoeira's recent resurgence, 
Thompson admits that today's movement 
does not hold a candle to its peak of popu-
larity in the 1980s when it inspired "some 
jerky B-movies." But, at least to him, its 
continued popularity is not surprising: "In 
what other activity can you defend your-
self, dance, sing in a romance language, and 
be healthy? It's a total physical experience." 

And without another word, he bounded 
out of the dining hall with the TA following 
close behind. 

Still mystified by capoeira's mass 
appeal, I visited a class taught at a church 
near Olive Street. No one seemed to notice 
my presence as I studied the walls plastered 
in photos of capoeira mestres. Housewives, 
businessmen, and construction workers in 
various contortionist stretches were scat-
tered across the studio's hardwood floor. 
Their loose white uniforms were reminis-
cent of karate, but more casual-a fitting 
characterization for capoeira in general. 

The silent concentration of the stu-
dents was broken by a belly laugh from 
behind the studio wall. Efraim Silva 
entered the room, greeting his flock with a 
warm smile and a sadistic call for even 
deeper stretches. Silva, the self-proclaimed 
"embodiment of capoeira" in New Haven, 
opened the city's first studio, Gina 
Brasileira Inc., eight years ago. Last year, he 
brought his class to Yale's Payne-Whitney 
Gym. "The first day of class, there were 
forty-one students," he recalled in a thick 
Brazilian accent. "We had to divide into 
two classes." 

With the studio full, Silva paced the 
floor, watching his students begin to put 
their own personalities into the movement, 
straddling the gap between martial art and 
dance. Occasionally, he picked up a jug-
like instrument attached to the base of an 
archery bow, which he played with a pick 
made of bean-filled maracas. 

As the class neared the two-hour mark, 
everyone gathered into a roda, or sparring 
circle. Here it all came together-the danc-
ing and fighting united in a seamless syn-
thesis of body and soul, rhythm and mind, 
as pair after pair faced off, at once partners 
and adversaries. 

Back on campus, Yale capoeiristas 
have their own theories about the popular-
ity of the martial art. Becca Falik sees it as 
a break from rigid classroom learning, a 
chance to experience "the wisdom of gener-
ations of capoeira sages that is passed down 
through the spiritual chain of master to 
student." Ja-Shukry says, "Yale students are 
just culture starved. All we really know is 
college culture, and in my opinion it wears 
thin and lacks true substance." Apparently, 
the intellectual stimulation and cultural 
diversity offered by one of the nation's top 
universities pales alongside the wisdom of 
sages. Never mind that this spiritually 
impoverished university offers courses in 
capoeira and has a faculty member who is 
an expert on the art.
