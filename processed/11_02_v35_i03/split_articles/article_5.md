AT Tl-IE CORNER OF ELM AND HoWE, in the 
huddle of establishments famous for their 
quick eats and cheap drinks, something has 
changed. There is a strange new glow 
around Rudy's Bar & Grill. It might be the 
new neon signs in the window. It might be 
the:: sunlight reflecting off the new sliver 
furniture outside. Ic might be the blinding 
whiteness of the "Belgian Frites" banner 
above the door against the crusty sienna 
bricks of the wall. One can't quite be sure. 
The ineffable magnetism which surrounds 
the dimly lie and cozily grimy dive draws 
you in to press your nose and grubby fin-
gers against the window and peer in with 
the wonderment of a child at the window 
of a toy store on Christmas Eve; or more 
poignantly, a college student at the window 
of a bar on a midweek afternoon. 

You cannot have failed to realize last 
year's addition of Belgian frites to Rudy's 
menu. Even if you've never tasted them (for 
shame!) the legend of their succulence and 
superioricy to any fry you've ever tasted has 
surely wafted down Elm Street and piqued 
your interest and your appetite. You may 
even have heard of the man behind the 
myth, Orner Ipek, known to those less inti-
mately acquainted with him as "the frites 
guy." Ipek, a Belgian native who came to 
the United States three years ago, started 
worlcing at Rudy's a year ago. No mere fry 
jockey, he trained as a chef at the Cuisine 
Beige Enseignement lnternationale in 
Brussels. (He also, conveniently, has a 
degree in Economics.) While worlcing in 
New York at "Belgian Fries" fast food 
chain, he met former Rudy's owner 
Thomas Henniger. As the two discussed 
NO'VEMBER 2002 
Henniger's business, Ipek says, "I cold him 
it was a good idea to add Belgian fries to his 
menu, because in a bar you drink beer, and 
fries go along very well with that." Orner 
lpek is a wise man with good taste. 

He has imported from Belgium the 
most essential tool of his craft: the frites 
machine. "You can't find that lcind of 
machine here," he explains. Belgian frites 
friolators are more powerful than the 
machines typically used in fast food restau-
rants in the United States, and they are 
larger and have round frying baskets. 
"With round baskets, the heat moves all 
around the sides of the basket, which cooks 
the potatoes faster and makes them crispi-
er," Ipek says. The differences between 
Rudy's plump and juicy frites and 
McDonald's fries, parched and chewy by 
comparison, don't stop there. Ipek's fries are 
xoo% vegetarian, cooked in soybean oil, 
and his potatoes are carefully hand-picked 
and prepared. "I don't buy Idaho or some 
cheap potato. I try to get rhe right size: 70 
count potatoes"-that is, 70 potatoes per 
50 pounds of potatoes-"which have a bet-
ter taste for fries than Idaho." Ipek hand-
peels rhe potatoes and soaks them 
overnight. Each day he dries them out 
before he "blanches" them in the fryer for 
several minutes at a low temperature. He 
sets them aside for at least half an hour 
before cooking them a second time at a 
higher temperature until they are ready to 
serve. lpek then presents each customer 
with a silver funnel overflowing with fries, 
gently glistening with soybean oil amidst 
the folds of wax paper and crowned by a 
tiny plastic spear, plunged whimsically into 
a frire. He offers his customers over 20 dif-
ferent sauces with which to eat their frices, 
including Belgian Mayonnaise, Curry 
Ketchup, Thai Peanut Butter, Andalouse, 
Americaine, and his personal favorite, 
Samurai. He imports their ingredients 
from a Belgian sauce company because, he 
says, "In Belgium they are very fancy about 
sauces." We're pretty damn fancy in New 
Haven roo: Rudy's now goes through 6oo 
pounds of potaroes a week. 

Orner Ipek has certainly brought a 
great deal to this bar with his frites. Before 
their advent, few people realized chat 
Rudy's even had a menu. Now, thanks co 
Ipek's European sensibility and talent in the 
kitchen, Rudy's is becoming known as a 
place for meals and snacks, as well as qual-
ity brews, good conversation, and loud 
punk music. But the mystique of the frites 
cannot wholly account for Rudy's new 
appeal. Those neon signs in the window 
are new. The stretched bunting set up out-
side when the weather is warm welcomes 
customers to "Rudy's Bar & Grill" and 
invites them to relax Parisian cafe-style in 
the outdoor furniture. Perhaps one should 
not be surprised to learn that Ipek himself 
is responsible: He is the new owner. 

"When I came here, I started by work-
ing in the kitchen," he says. "Then I began 
to work behind the bar as well. Then it 
happened that Henniger and I made a 
business deal and now I am in charge of all 
this. I want to add mussels to the menu. In 
Belgium this is very famous. You serve 
mussels in a pot with fries on the side and 
you have your beer. It's very popular." 

Expect the mussel premiere in three 
months. Ipek is also planning to renovate 
the equipment behind the bar and the 
kitchen, which he says is "good for the 
fries, but when you want to expand the 
menu you need more facilities." 

So, with the imminent addition of 
mussels ro the menu and the decor taking a 
new vibrant turn, we can only expect more 
new facets to the once comfortably dingy 
face of Rudy's. Whatever comes out of the 
vision of the owner, patrons can rest 
assured that it will be as closely monitored 
and cared for as the frites. "When you own 
your own business," Ipek explains earnest-
ly, "you have to be always here to check the 
quality of the food. You have to make sure 
your fries are different from other fries. 
They have to have something special or no 
one would come to eat them." So far, Ipek 
has satisfied at least his own tastes with his 
creations. "I like them a lot," he says smil-
ing. "I am crazy about potatoes!" And New 
Haven is crazy about Orner Ipek. After all, ' 
he's put the 'N' back in Rudy's Restaura_t.
