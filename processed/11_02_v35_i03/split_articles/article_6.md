LE6N, NICARAGUA IS PERHAPS the last place 
you'd expect to find a· pair. of colorblock 
Mickey Mouse shorts or, for that matter, 
tapered corduroy slacks. 
But Le6n, 
Nicaragua, is no stranger to such anachro-
nisms of taste and missteps of fashion. 

Each year the city receives more than 
r8,ooo pounds of clothing and material aid 
from the residents of New Haven, all of it 
selected, sorted, packed, and shipped by 
members of the New Haven-Le6n Sister 
City Project. 

Packing the clothing, which is donat-
ed by local consignment stores, into boxes 
is a monumental triannual affair: The latest 
session cakes place on a dreary Friday that 
threatens to dump a week's worth of t:ain 
on a New Haven back porch covered in 
clothing bound for Nicaragua. At its epi-
center are five middle-aged women, all of 
them long-time Sister City volunteers. The 
packing is lively, punctuated at times with 
the conspiracy and subdued gossip of an 
afternoon bridge club or the negotiated 
push-and-pull of an urban flea market. Bur 
at its core it is governed by the supreme 
taste of five unabashed fashionistas. Patti, 
one of the quintet, holds up a brown flow-
ered skirt and matching headband. "That's 
cute!" another c:Xdaims. "But look, the 
headband is stained right here. It's insulting 
to send something dirty like that," some-
one else responds. A third asks: "We can't 
send the skirt without the headband. Can 
we?" 

The ladies do not take lightly their 
roles as guardians of good fashion sense. A 
first round of inspection expels all dirty or 
torn items, as well as winter clothing: pea-
coats and J. Crew sweaters would elicit 
only laughter i£ through some slight of 
judgment, they were to infiltrate the 
Central American heat. The second round 
is crucially important: Beyond the obvious 
rejects like stonewashed jeans and T-shirts 
bearing names of long-defunct sports 
teams, sorting through the heaps of cloth-
ing requires subtle discrimination. Should 
a wooly vest with short sleeves be sent? A 
size 14 white tennis dress? An unsightly pair 
of cargo shorts? Lingerie? 

In Le6n, where the clothing is sold by 
local residents for a nominal price in order 
to fund community projects, another 
round of selection awaits the boxes marked 
6 
'ropa hombres' and 'ropa mujeres.' Many of 
the members of the Sister Cities have visit-
ed Nicaragua and report that the women of 
Le6n are not eager to suffer the beige and 
gray staples of a New England wardrobe. 
Brenda recalls describing her cupcake 
Connecticut home to the women of Le6n: 
"They were astonished. They said, 'pink 
and blue! Why, those are the sad colors!'" 
Someone tsks: "The 'sad colors' ... imagine! 
When I was there, I went to a weaving 
workshop. They wanted to dye everything 
bright orange. They don't understand that 
no one here wants to buy a bright orange 
shirt." 

Clashes of culture and cotton notwith-
standing, the insatiable wheel of fashion 
keeps on turning: Garments made in 
Nicaraguan factories are peddled to trend 
setters by stores in the United States; reject-
ed items eventually stagnate in consign-
ment stores and charity trucks, then wax 
back to Nicaragua. The first material aid to 
reach Le6n arrived in the suitcases and 
knapsacks of a handful of New Haven resi-
dents, who carne with a 'Wimesses for 
Peace' group during the Contra War of the 
1980s. Their purpose then was to assist the 
people of Nicaragua without caking sides in 
the conflict. Almost two decades later, the 
war is over, but the motivating principle 
remains unchanged and The Sister City 
project has grown to include a bicycle 
exchange, a sustainable agriculture pro-
gram, frequent delegations to Nicaragua, 
and the establishment of a locally staffed 
office to manage the projects. 

On the New Haven side, the Le6n 
venture has struggled to maintain signifi-
cance in a decade without warfare. It is a 
question, as enunciated by director Jean 
Silk, of making sure the project's purpose 
remains relevant and well-defined. 

Purpose is indeed abundant at the 
box-packing session, and principled aid has 
by no means given way to arbitrary altru-
ism. Silk compares how Austrians pick 
their sister cities-"by taking maps and 
drawing concentric circles from each capi-
tal city" -to New Haven's technique-
forming a connection based on similarities 
between the two cities and the relationships 
that visitors formed and subsequent visitors 
continue to nurture. 

The story of the Sister Cities program 
is one of a group dedicated to a cause 
stripped of its political luster but rich in 
personal meaning. While other activists 
adopt sexy catch-phrases and campaigns 
for 'social justice' or 'an end to all war,' the 
Sister City project measures its success not 
by how loudly it raises its voice but with 
hard, material evidence: the number ofT-
shirts packed, wells built, bicycles shipped. 

Many of the members have committed 
months or even years to establishing func-
tional civic projects in Le6n. Theirs is a 
brute materialism taken to a philanthropic 
extreme. 

The political statement endures with-
out being gaudy, and the fashion statement 
is clear: New Haven is dressing the resi-
dents of its sister city, and dressing them 
well.
