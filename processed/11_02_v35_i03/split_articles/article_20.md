IN THE EARLY FALL OF 1989, three girls in traditional Muslim head-
scarves entered a small public school in northern France. 
Innocuous as the garments may have been, the school's headmaster 
forbade the girls to enter their classrooms until they removed the 
scarves. 

When they refused, he banished them to the school's 
library, citing infringement of France's venerated code of laicit~ 
radical separation of church and state. What ensued was more than 
half a decade of histrionics and political. conflict. The "Affair of the 
Scarf," as it became known, implicated 
everyone from then-President Francois 
Mitterand to public intellectuals like Regis 
Debray to the justices of the country's high 
court. In question was whether the presence 
of religious clothing such as the scarves· poses 
a threat to liberal democratic principles. 
Mainstream feminists said yes, the scarves are 
symbols of oppression; centristS and right-
wingers said yes, they represent a threat tO 
France's deep-seated secular values; only a 
few leftists disagreed, arguing that the girls 
had willfully decided to wear the headgear. 
But no clear solution emerged: In 1994, the 
Minister of Education declared that French 
studentS could wear discreet religious sym-
bols (such as yarmulkes), but not head-
scarves, essentially ending the controversy 
exactly where it had started. 

This bitter episode occupies just a few 
pages of Seyla Benhabib's latest book, The 
Claims of Culture, but it neatly representS the 
central problem of the work: How can liber-
al democracy and multiculturalism co-exist? 
How can we maintain democratic principles 
of equality and inclusion, such as those 
which undergird public schools, when cer-
tain individuals and groups, like the three 
Muslim girls, actively demand to be recognized as different and 
excluded on cultural grounds? That may sound like the kind of 
question that only a political philosopher would ask-Benhabib is 
the Eugene Meyer Professor of Political Science and Philosophy at 
Yale-but in the age of the so-called "clash of civilizations," 
Benhabib could hardly have picked a better time tO turn that issue 
over in her mind. The Claims of Culture is a sobering assessment of 
contemporary cultural struggles and an inspiring, though ultimate-
ly unsatisfying, attempt to resolve a problem that afllictS democra-
cies today. 

The Claims of Culture: Equality and Diversity in the Global Era 
by Seyla Benhabib (Princeton 2002) pp. 216. 

Benhabib's motivation for asking the fundamental question of 
the book springs from a close look at reality. We live in a globalized 
world, she observes, in which democratic governments increasingly 
come into conflict with groups that demand recognition of their 
different ways of life and values, often at the expense of stability and 
peace. 

Cultural groups and s;paratiscs movementS alike make 
demands of democracies that often undermine democratic values. 
"Reflecting a social dynamic we have hardly begun to compre-
hend," she writes, "global integration 
is proceeding alongside sociocultural 
disintegration, the resurgence of vari-
ous separatisms, and international 
terrorism." The "Affair of the Scarf" 
· is one symptom of this new global 
condition, as are such disparate 
movements as the Tibetan indepen-
dence struggle, Native American land 
claims, Taliban fundamentalism, and 
calls for cultural recognition on col-
lege campuses. 

To dismiss such 
struggles over identity politics out-
right, as some cultural conservatives 
do, or as an invention of elites, as 
some Marxists do, is "bad sociology." 
Theorists of democracy, Benhabib 
warns, must confront issues of cultur-
al struggle or risk being irrelevant. 

Benhabib is a devoted liberal 
democrat foremost, and she cherishes 
the belief that human beings are 
moral and political equals. 
She 
believes that all people can communi-
cate with one another and come to a 
consensus if they devote enough 
effort to the cask In today's political 
climate, however, this is a gutsy 
claim. One need only look to a democratic country like Spain, 
where Basque separatistS are waging a violent, seemingly unresolv-
able campaign for secession, for an example in which dialogue 
seems hopeless. For precisely this reason, Benhabib thinks that 
democracies must be willing to negotiate alien customs, beliefs, and 
moral frameworks. Otherwise, they cannot be true to the defini-
tion of democracy as she sees it: a state in which "decisions affect-
ing the well-being of a collectivity can be viewed as the outcome of 
a procedure of free and reasoned deliberation" and in ·which "the 
institutions that claim obligatory power do so because their deci-
