In a recent study only 20 percent of schools 
met all the government's nutritional 
requirements. "Lots of times I didn't like 
the school lU.Qch," Juan said, "and so I 
would buy a soda or a candy bar or maybe 
both." Juan's decision to skip school meals 
and buy food from the vending machines 
was not unusual. "Lots of these kids are eat-
ing two meals a day at school. If the school 
lunch doesn't appeal to them, they turn to 
the vending machines. They have very lim-
ited healthy options," said Berry. Schools 
across the country have lined their hallways 
with candy-stocked vending machines and 
filled their cafeterias with a Ia caru fast-
food chains as a way to make money. 
Nationwide, vending machines account for 
approximately $750 million annually in 
extra funds for schools. The profits are sub-
stantial and help pay for additional pro-
grams and facilities, but they come at a 
high price. 

Many students in the class come from 
families and communities where obesity 
and diabetes have become standard. In 
order to break the cycle of obesity and its 
related health problems, the class had to 
address the larger context in which these 
children were living. Though the pro-
gram told the kids to eat more 
vegetables 
and 
more of 
"nature's candy"-fruit-
one look into a small 
inner-city 
grocery 
makes it clear that 
these things are not so 
easy for families to 
provide. "Many of the 
families have to take 
two buses to get to a 
good grocery store, and 
the stores nearby might 
have one or two sorry looking 
heads of iceberg lenuce to choose 
from," explained Grey. So one Sarurday 
morning Galasso gathered about a dozen 
students and mothers at a big grocery store 
nearby and showed them healthy and cost-
effective options. "I taught them how to 
use what was in season and showed them 
the nuts and bolts of reading food labels." 
Halfway through the program, 
the 
researchers found that parents had altered 
their shopping co include more healthy 
choices, which was something the parents 
~nributed to their children's participation 
m the program. Juan's family incorporated 
much of what he learned into their daily 
lives. "I would tell my family so that we 
could adjust what we were doing. My fam-
ily has cut down on sweets and fats and 
instead of frying foods they steam them." 
Everyone in his family lost weight, but 
Juan put it best when he said, "I think my 
family feels better." 

F
EWER THAN HALF of American school 
children have daily opportunities to 
engage in structured physical activity. At 
Fair Haven Middle School, Juan has gym 
only twice a week. He doesn't play sports, 
and he couldn't say whether there is a foot-
ball team or a basketball team at his school. 
Inner city schools often lack the time and 
space for effective physical education. 
Exercise was not part of the daily routine 
for many of the children enrolled in the 
after-school intervention program. 

The physical activity training part of 
the program did not demand that the stu-
dents engage in formal, rigorous exercise. 
Instead, it was designed to help students 
change their lifestyles. Berry explained the 
snategy: "We spent a lot of time talking 
about sedentary and non-sedentary 
activities and brainstorming 
ways to cut down on time 
spent sitting in front of 
the TV or computer 
and thinking of other 
things to do." By rein-
forcing the value of 
any kind of physical 
activity-be it actual 
exercise or just active 
behavior-the teachers 
hoped to help the sru-
dents modify their own 
environments. 

Physical activity was Juan's 
favorite part of the program: "I liked it best 
when we played outside and danced for a 
long time in the music room." During one 
class, the students were told that they were 
on the new Survivor series "Getting Back to 
Basics in Activity" and that they had to use 
three random props to design and perform 
a ten- to fifteen-minute routine. The props 
were everyday household items-<:anned 
goods, towels, chairs, as well as affordable 
items such as tennis balls, jump ropes, and 
basketballs. Through this process, the stu-
dents learned to create games and activities 
for themselves. Most often during the 
physical activity portion of the class, how-. 
ever, the students were simply asked to do 
something active, whether it was dancing 
to hip-hop CDS (everyone's favorite) or sim-
ply taking a walk with one of the exercise 
teachers. Many of the children whose 
neighborhoods do not have big parks to 
play in or community sports teams to play 
on had long ago given up on physical activ-
ity. "They see things as skinny or fat, couch 
potato or marathon runner, so we tried to 
introduce a middle ground," Grey said.

ROUTINES, forced 
acronyms, and weekly worksheets 
seem too simple to be a viable solution to a 
national health problem of such depth and 
scale. But these simple solutions may, in 
fact, be a foundation upon which to build 
a national response. After twelve months, 
nearly all of the students in the program 
had stabilized their glucose tolerance, and 
their insulin metabolism had improved. In 
addition, students' behaviors changed dra-
matically: They consumed fewer calories, 
had greater dietary knowledge, became 
more active and, perhaps most surprisingly, 
helped their families change their patterns 
of behavior, suggesting a "trickle down" 
effect ftom the school into the entire com-
munity. 

With the results confirmed, Dr. Grey 
and her research 
team 
have 
been 
approached by school systems across the 
country asking for advice and information 
abo'ut the program. While eager to share 
the information, Dr. Grey is also quick to 
explain that it was a pilot study and that 
the full-scale trial she is currently working 
on will provide more substantial and per-
haps more accurate answers. The next 
study will take place in four New Haven 
middle schools and will be incorporated 
into the regular school day. 

One of the driving beliefs behind the 
program is that schools are the perfect place 
to begin addressing problems that plague 
entire communities. One teacher quoted in 
the proposal for the study said, "We as 
teachers need to expand our knowledge 
base and understand rhe benefits of good 
nutrition and physical activity. We are in 
the perfect position to reach young people 
in our schools and promote healthy 
lifestyles." The hope is that this informa-
tion, provided at the most basic levels, will 
eventually change larger community pat-
terns. "Dr. Grey's program is innovative in 
that it focuses on prevention at all," 
explained Brownell. "There is very little 
else currently being done to prevent this 
societal problem." Connecticut is among 
the few states starting to address actively 
the discrepancy in health that is prevalent 
among its citizens. Dr. Grey's program is at 
the forefront of research in the field, and 
politicians around the state have begun to 
take note. State Senator Toni Harp has 
incorporated the health concerns at hand 
into her political agenda. With Senator 
Harp's push, Connecticut is one of only six 
states whose efforts to promote nutrition 
and physical activity have been awarded 
funding by the national Centers for Disease 
Control. Harp founded and co-chairs the 
Coalition to Fight Childhood Obesity in 
New Haven and was a key promoter of a 
resolution passed last April by the 
Connecticut general assembly concerning 
nutrition in public schools. One of the 
most important reasons for adopting the 
resolution was "to assist in the reduction 
and prevention of obesity and non-insulin-
using (Type 2) diabetes in children." On a 
small scale, these solutions look promising. 

If Juan and his family were able to 
reverse the trends in their life, and if four 
New Haven schools adopt active preven-
tion program, does this mean that the epi-
demic can be managed? The most signifi-
cant obstacle in the way of large-scale 
change seems to be that Juan lives in a 
community where obesity is the most nat-
ural path. Solutions are presented to chil-
dren who live in a fat-saturated world. 
Brownell's hope, however, is that the sort of 
action demonstrated by Harp and Grey 
will be noticed. "Ultimately the people and 
the government are in a position to do 
something similar regarding obesity as they 
have recently done with tobacco." Juan's 
success could be evidence that the problem 
can be solved, but until the obesity-rein-
forcing infrastructure of society is torn 
down, Juan's will be an uphill march. -
