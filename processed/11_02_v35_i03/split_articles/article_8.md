ST. MARY's CHURCH TOWERS high above 
Hillhouse Avenue. Inside are vaulted ceil-
ings, pastel walls, and lifelike statues, but 
the church is most notable for being the 
only building on Hillhouse not owned by 
Yale. When it was built in 1874, however, 
St. Mary's was even more out of place: It 
was surrounded by extravagant private 
mansions, whose wealthy residents looked 
on in horror when the cash-strapped 
Roman Catholic Church ran out of funds 
as the building neared completion-leav-
ing it without a steeple--and poor immi-
grants began to flock to the spireless edi-
fice, "constructed of stone which gives it a 
cold and repulsive appearance." An 1879 
article about Hillhouse Avenue-described 
by Charles Dickens as the most beautiful 
street in America-in The New York Times 
carried the snide subtitle, "How an aristo-
cratic avenue was blemished by a Roman 
Church edifice." 

Fortunately for St. Mary's, this less 
than flattering coverage did not determine 
its resting place in history. Just a few years 
after its opening, one of the parish's young 
priests, Father Michael McGivney, founded 
an organization to unite the men of the 
parish. He hoped to offer an alternative to 
secret societies, a popular outlet for young, 
lonely immigrant males who found them-
selves in a hostile new environment. 

Instead of mysterious rituals and secret 
handshakes, McGivney wanted to create a 
fraternal organization that combined this 
sense of belonging with the values and 
charitable mission of the Catholic Church. 
In 1882, in the basement of St. Mary's, 
McGivney founded 
the Knights of 
Columbus, a "fraternal service organization 
of Catholic men." 

Today the organization has over a mil-
lion members in 13 countries. The support 
network that McGivney envisioned has 
expanded to even offer a life insurance plan 
to its members. The Knights of Columbus 
current headquarters-where the organiza-
tion's 750 employees manage its insurance 
company and other worldly affairs-sits 
across town from St. Mary's. By espousing 
the doctrines of faith, fraternity, and life 
insurance, the Knights of Columbus seems 
to have access to both the pocketbooks and 
the willing volunteerism of its members: 
They claim to have donated nearly a billion 
dollars and 400 million hours of service to 
charity. They also proudly describe them-
selves as "the strong right arm of the 
Catholic Church," and their political views

always echo those of the Vatican. 

One of the Knights' charitable causes 
was a renovation of the roof of St. Mary's. 
In 1982, they set out to create "an architec-
tural exclamation point between heaven 
and earth": a 179-foot steeple topped with 
an eleven-foot gold cross. The crown jewel 
of the Knights' New Haven empire, how-
ever, is the two-year-old Knights of 
Columbus museum, a block from the New 
Haven train station. On most afternoons, 
the concrete building is quiet inside, but 
the front desk attendant is more than 
happy to orient visitors and describe the 
temporary exhibitions-at the moment, a 
display of Russian icons and a 9/11 memor-
ial. 

The bulk of the museum's content, of 
course, is dedicated to the fraternal order 
itself. The trophy room displays awards 
donated by national Knights of Columbus 
councils, an article about Babe Ruth estab-
lishing that the slugger himself was a 
Knight, and a letter signed by current 
Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura pro-
claiming May 20, 2001, "Knights of 
Columbus Day." 

In the Christopher Columbus room, 
the Knights' patron is honored by displays 
ranging from a sugar bowl bearing his like-
ness to a late nineteenth century child's 
penny bank upon which the explorer sits. 
Father 
McGivney 
allegedly 
chose 
Columbus, a devout Catholic, as the 
Knights' patron with the intention of 
likening his Atlantic crossing to those of 
the organization's immigrant members. 

Another exhibit explains why members are 
known as Knights-a dramatic flair that is 
the legacy of James T. Mullen, the order's 
first lay leader. 

In the back of St. Mary's Church, 
behind the rows of wooden pews, stands a 
dark marble vault. The top of the structure 
is formed into a crucifix, and a plaque on 
its side explains its contents: When the 
Knights of Columbus gave St. Mary's 
Church a steeple in 1982, they also encased 
the remains of their founder, Father 
McGivney, in the church. In 2000, they 
also lobbied to nominate him for canoniza-
tion, the first official step to sainthood in 
the Catholic Church. If the Vatican 
declares him a saint, the Knights can rest 
assured that the soul of their founder 
8 
resides in heaven. Apparently, the Knights 
of Columbus provide not only life insur-
ance, but after-life insurance as well.
