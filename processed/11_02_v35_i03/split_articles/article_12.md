the sentiment from somewhere: "If

the church, a tum-of-the-20TH-century 
in New Haven's rough Dixwell neigh-
the "Amens" and "Go-Ons" of 
congregation alternate with guffaws of 
·cion. The popular preacher is just 
started. 

Hopelessness might seem an unbcar-
burden here in the shadow of an Ivy 
university that often forgets 
residents when they stop sweep-
floors and serving food and go home 
the night. "You all know those people, 
know they're out there," he reminds his 
IMl,tre,~tiion. "You know those people who 
it to the top and forget the folks who 
them there. Some of y'all got managers 
that. You think they'd understand your 
But don't you dare throw in the 
We know a God who will help you 
your faith." 

Lee has made it his mission in life to 
those at the top of what they owe to 
who sustain them, and to see that jus-
is done. In an effort to link the dis-
communities of which he is a part-
Yale and the ghetto that surrounds it-the 
Dixwell pastor recently ran as a petition 
candidate for an alumni seat on the Yale 
Corporation-the University's governing 
board and ultimate authority, traditionally 
a bastion of wealth and national influence. 
Despite showing early promise, he was 
trounced. Today's sermon comes roughly 
one year after he began in earnest the cam-
paign that filled his community with the 
hope of finally being heard. But Lee's God, 
as he tells his congregation, is a God who 
curns weaknesses into strengths and 
mishaps into miracles. With the power of 
his God behind him, the thrashing Lee 
took at the hands of administrators and fel-
low alumni may well be a blessing in dis-
guise-one which leads all of Dixwell out 
of the jungle and into the promised land. 

THE PART OF ANsoNIA, Connecticut, 
I where Lee grew up was what Dixwell is 
today: a crossroads of poverty and privilege. 
Lee was from "the wrong side of the 
tracks." The world of his childhood sounds 
much like the jungle described by 
Grandmaster Flash: His mother raised him 
and his six siblings in a four-room apart-
ment. He had no contact with his father. 
Family members used drugs. His family 
moved from the projects to the north end 
of town when Lee was ten, and he was 
given his frrst glimpse of life across the 
divide. He vividly remembers the first day 
of fifth grade. "Me and another girl were 
the only two blacks in the classroom. I was 
like, wow, my other school had been 
diverse, but this was something else alto-
gether." He soon befriended a boy named 
Keith who lived in the whiter, wealthier 
Hilltop neighborhood. The two would 
hang out listening to Keith's father's Elvis 
Presley records; Lee was soon a die-hard 
&.n, borrowing LPs to listen to at home. He 
says of the time spent in Keith's house, 
"That was the first time I was ever in a 
white person's home, and he was my friend. 
We were the same .... That's when I knew 
that there was another side to life. That 
made me say, 'This is what I want to be."' 

Football, it became clear as he grew 
older, was one inroad to prosperity. 
Knowing his mother could not pay for col-
lege, Lee set his sights on earning a football 
scholarship to anywhere that would take 
him. He admits that he was in the right 
place at the right time. "I was privileged to 
be part of a football tradition that was sec-
ond to none in the state of Connecticut," 
Lee says of the football program at Ansonia 
High School. On the gridiron he found 
what he calls "an understanding of what I 
would like life to be like in the future. 
Ansonia wasn't all black or all white; it was 
a mixture. On the field, the only skin that 
mattered was the pigskin. You had young 
men from all walks of life coming together 
to work toward a common goal." 

When Lee talks about the children of 
Dixwell-his favorite topic when dis-
cussing Yale-New Haven relations-you 
get the sense that he sees in their lives the 
same hardships he endured, only with 
fewer opportunities to leave those hard-
ships behind. They too come into contact 
everyday with a wealthy white kids' house 
up on the hill-Yale University. "Kids 
should be able to do more than just visit 
and walk through the halls of this great 
institution. They'll allow kids to sit and see 
all the prestige ofYale, but never have a fair 
fighting chance to attend it? That's crimi-
nal." So he calls for Yale not only to send 
student tutors into New Haven neighbor-
hoods, but to tap into its $II billion endow-
ment and give financial support to New 
Haven public schools. Lee says he too 
wanted to attend Yale. But when Syracuse 
offered him a full scholarship for football, 
he had to accept. 

Lee lettered all four years at Syracuse 
as a defensive back. One game in particular 
stands out in his mind. In the early 1980s, 
Syracuse head coach Dick MacPherson was 
struggling to rebuild a failing program that 
the University was considering cutting 
altogether. The turning point that Lee 
credits with saving the program carne dur-
ing his junior year, when Syracuse hosted 
top-ranked 
Nebraska 
at 
home 
on 
17

September 17, 1983. The year before, 
Nebraska had shamed Syracuse in Lincoln, 
winning 63-7. This year, both teams were 
undefeated, 
though 
Syracuse 
was 
unranked. "We upset them 17-9,'' Lee says. 
"And that was our greatest game. That 
game I'll never forget-because we shocked 
the world." Lee's preacher demeanor is gen-
tle and conciliatory, but you are always 
aware of the potentially explosive power of 
the underdog beneath the veneer. You 
know he has told this story a thousand 
times. He loves the shock of 
it. He relishes the credibili-
ty earned in a scrappy, 
come-from-behind revenge 
victory. To hear him talk, 
you'd think he almost likes 
starting with one mark in 
the loss column: Having 
disarmed his opponents by 
lowering their expectations, 
he can hit them full force 
for a win even sweeter for 
the surprise. 

I EE PLAYED HIS SENIOR 
l.year with torn cartilage in 
his knee. Having always 
planned on playing profes-
sionally, he took a year off 
after college to have arthro-
scopic 
surgery, 
then 
arranged try-outs for the 
New England Patriots, the 
New York Giants, and the 
Dallas Cowboys. He was 
cut from both the Patriots' L-----= 
and the Giants' squads, and as he was about 
to fly to Dallas, his knee swelled up again. 
In what he calls the most difficult decision 
of his life, he decided not to get on the 
plane and to give up his hopes for a profes-
sional career. Football, after all, offered no 
sure future. A photo above Lee's desk in his 
church office reminds him of this. It was 
taken after the best play he ever made, a 
blocked field goal he returned for a touch-
down. Lee holds the ball triumphantly in 
the air, beaming, as teammates jump to 
congratulate him. This is not what Lee 
notices in the photo, however. He sees Wes 
Dove, a hulking lineman in the right side 
of the frame. "He was a gentle giant," Lee 
says, "everybody's friend, and one hell of a 
football player." Dove tried out for the 
Miami Dolphins after graduation. When 
18 
he didn't make the cut, Lee recounts matter 
had been making a good living for a few 
of facdy, he went home and put a bullet 
years, first by selling Fords and Subarus, 
through his head. 

Unlike Dove, Lee had never staked 
everything on a pro career. Even before he 
dreamed of playing football, Lee knew that 
his true vocation was the ministry. The call 
came when he was ten, in an event Lee 
labels "The Budweiser Experience." He 
and his friend Morgan Johnson, called 
MoJo, were walking across the projects one 
Saturday morning to the nightclub owned 
~-----w---, a PhD and pursue a 
by MoJo's father, whom they helped with 
clean-up chores for pocket money. Lee rold 
his friend then that he wanted to be a min-
ister when he grew up, though he couldn't 
say why. Later, as they sat at MoJo's father's 
bar sipping soda, MoJo called out with a 
laugh, "Hey Dad, you know what David 
wants to be when he grows up? A preach-
er!" "Nah, you don't want to be a preacher," 
Mr. Johnson replied-a sentence that was 
punctuated by the crash of a giant 
Budweiser mirror that had suddenly fallen 
from the wall behind him. "Son," Johnson 
said to Lee as he surveyed the damage, "you 
be whatever you want." "It scared the day-
lights out of me," Lee says. That fear led 
him to keep his plans to himself. 

In 1989, Lee finally enrolled in semi-
nary at the Yale Divinity School. At 25, he 
then by selling insurance. He gave up his ' 
$40,000 salary and cook out loans to pay 
for school. "I decided that instead of just 
making money, I needed to pastor people 
and make a difference in people's lives," Lee 
says. His determination was reinforced 
during his last year of study for his Master 
ofTheology degree. Caught up in the incel-
lectual engagement he found at YDS, Lee 
debated whether to continue his studies for 
career as an academic 
theologian, or to stop 
tll•lll with his master's and 
pastor a church. As Lee 
and a group of friends 
confronting the same 
dilemma sat debating, 
Lee's 20-year-old cousin 
was shoe through the 
neck in a gang fight 
down the hill in Dixwell. 
Lee .accompanied his 
aunt to the morgue to 
identify the body, and 
the event redirected the 
course of his life for 
good. He returned to 
YDS determined that his 
third year would be his 
lase. "I realized I couldn't 
sic up there and study all 
that theory if it didn't 
make 
any 
difference 
down below. I needed to 
do something practical, 
to help build a bridge between the Valley 
and the Hill." After graduating, Lee pas-
cored numerous churches in New Jersey 
and one in Meriden, Connecticut, before 
being transferred to Varick in 1998. Not 
long afterward, with labor negotiations 
looming on the horizon, the Yale adminis-
tration began talking openly about 
strengthening the partnership between Yale 
and New Haven. To Lee, the time seemed 
right to build a bridge. 

'i"HE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED ITSELF 
I when Levin started talking about part-
nership, partnership, partnership," Lee says 
of Yale President Richard Levin's positive 
rhetoric that led to his decision to run for 
the board. "So I asked myself.. are they seri-
ous about partnership? I never fathomed
