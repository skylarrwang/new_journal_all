Dear readers,
On August 24, Old Campus was in a state of happy chaos. Upperclassmen movers cheered as bewildered first years 
lugged duffel bags, posters, and futons to their dorms.

Just over a week earlier, on the other side of College St., the New Haven Green had been host to a very different kind 
of commotion when first responders rushed to the scene of a mass K2 overdose. Around the city, paramedics ferried more 
than 70 people, all reeling from a bad batch of synthetic marijuana laced with fentanyl, to the hospital. As Yale opened 
its iron gates to the 1,578 members of the class of 2022, the outbreak served as a reminder of the stark inequality between 
the university and the city it calls home. 

That dichotomy is profound, and it matters. But we’d like to encourage our readers to look beyond it, to consider Yale 
and New Haven’s complexities and the ways that the city and university are intertwined.

The New Journal was founded in 1967 as the Magazine of Yale and New Haven. Our mission is to write critically and 
thoughtfully about our campus and our city. Students: We publish five issues a year, and we’re always looking for writers, 
photographers, and designers for both print and web. No experience necessary––we’re equally committed to publishing 
compelling pieces and making creative nonfiction accessible to and inclusive of all voices on campus. The reporting for 
our cover story this issue, on the battle against cash bail, was funded by the Edward Bennett III Memorial Fund, created 
in honor of an alumnus who revived this publication in the 1980s after suffering a severe spinal cord injury and went on 
to become the first quadriplegic to graduate from Yale College. It’s our hope that this fund will make ambitious reporting 
projects financially feasible for anyone who’s interested. So if you have an idea for a story, pitch us this fall!

A big thank you to our dedicated editors, who spent much of their summers helping our writers report and sculpt the 
narratives you’ll read here, and who spent 12+ hours a day last week hunting down typos in a small, stifling room with only 
one (semi-functional) fan. 

We hope you enjoy our features, which take a frank look at criminal justice and eviction in New Haven and at the battle 
brewing in Bridgeport, our neighbor to the west, over a plan to bring a casino to town. Also in this issue: read about the 
women transforming Yale’s comedy scene, the world of digital archives at Sterling Memorial Library, the psychology of 
roommate pairings, and lots more. Happy reading––and, as always, we’d love to hear from you.

In the world of the “ghetto potter,” it takes a mess to make art. 

Spectators in the luminous gallery room of Artspace press up against one another, wary of bumping into the artwork on display. Detailed portraits, written messages, penciled outlines, and colorful decals cover the walls. Music commences, and the attendees part, making way for 15-year-old Jordan Walker. He struts in time with a pulsating house beat. When he reaches the other side of the room, a grand-fi­nale backbend provokes wild applause. The music ends, and Walker poses in front of his portrait: Olympic gymnast Sim­one Biles, her fist raised and brow furrowed. A man in a wide-brim baseball cap takes Walker under his arm and exclaims, “I taught him everything he knows!” 

“I really am a shy person, until you get to know me and that really takes a long time, but I thought, what the heck, I might as well do a dance,” Walker said later. “I was able to break out of my shell.”

Walker was one of nineteen student performers in Paying Homage: Soil and Site, the show that concluded Artspace New Haven’s 2018 Summer Apprenticeship Program (SAP). Housed on Orange Street just south of the New Haven Green, Artspace focuses on providing a platform for contem­porary artists to create art and connect with wider audiences. SAP, started in 2001, brings New Haven high school students under the instruction of a master artist each year.  

The man embracing Walker was ceramicist Roberto Lugo, this year’s artist-in-residence. For three weeks this summer, students from Greater New Haven worked with Lugo to honor their communities and the figures that have shaped them. At Lugo’s urging, for the first time, the program invited students from abroad to work alongside students from Con­necticut: two teenage visitors from Riobamba, Ecuador.

Lugo, who is of Puerto Rican descent and calls himself “the ghetto potter,” found ceramics inadvertently. Growing up in Kensington, a Philadelphia neighborhood, Lugo says his education was substandard. After graduating from high school, he was caught in a cycle of dead-end jobs. At 25, Lugo enrolled in ceramics classes at a community college, seeking change and companionship.

“[In] my culture, mostly having blue collar types of employment...you figure out how to make things with machines,” Lugo said. “[Ceramics] seemed like the most natural way for me to work.”

Today, much of Lugo’s work is Victorian-inspired porce­lain-ware, ranging from urns to tea sets. The artist pointed to porcelain as a symbol of class division; the material has historically been reserved for the elite. But his pieces typi­cally portray hip-hop artists like Kendrick Lamar, civil rights leaders like Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson, and victims of gun violence like Freddie Gray. By painting historically marginal­ized icons onto the pottery, Lugo says he reclaims the mate­rial. Recently, he’s been returning home to Kensington with a generator and pottery wheel. By crafting ceramics in the streets, Lugo hopes to invite pedestrians to experiment with the sometimes-alienating art form. 

In their own work, the summer students honored a wide range of figures––from nationally recognized icons to their own relatives. Adara Huq chose to honor prominent Black trans activist Marsha P. Johnson, a leader in the 1969 Stone­wall uprising. In the portrait, Johnson poses in front of col­lage of bright colors and wears a shirt patterned with the out­lines of protesters holding up signs reading “Stonewall means fight back.” 

“The movement has been white-washed a lot,” Huq said. “Not a lot of people know or realize that a Black trans woman was the lead of it.” 

India Wolterstorff’s piece paid tribute to Estelle Griswold, who gained notoriety for the Griswold v. Connecticut case brought before The Supreme Court, which set the stage for reproductive rights by legalizing contraception for married couples in Connecticut. Griswold was the former head of Planned Parenthood’s New Haven branch, where Wolter­storff herself teaches other teens about sexual health. 

“It was really important to me to do someone who is local to New Haven,” Wolterstorff said. 

But none was so lucky as apprentice Jaida Stancil, whose subject came to the opening celebration. Stancil honored her grandmother, a construction worker in Connecticut, for her strength in choosing a field that employs few Black women. 

“Yeah, she’s going to cry,” Stancil said, nervously checking her phone as she awaited her grandma’s arrival.

Helen Kauder, director of Artspace, said the program directors have begun to opt for emerging artists rather than veterans as instructors; the first summer of SAP, renowned conceptual artist Sol Lewitt, 73-years-old and at the peak of his artistic career, led the program. They’ve also focused on recruiting artists who resemble the majority-Black and Latinx students at SAP.

“What I found really refreshing working with these stu­dents was that we were able to find intersections and support one another. It created this space where we understood each others’ plight and we could celebrate in one another’s differ­ences,” Lugo reflected after his own performance. 

Compared to Sol Lewitt, whose wall drawings involve carefully calculated instructions to be executed with incredi­ble precision, Lugo is less scrupulous. 

“I’m sort of a perfectionist, and Roberto helped me let go a little bit because clay doesn’t always turn out how you first want it to when it gets fired,” Wolterstorff said.

Resourcefulness oftentimes doesn’t lead to perfection; in these cases, messy is most beautiful. A Wexler Gallery video from 2016 captures Lugo in an abandoned lot near his child­hood home, spinning clay from the detritus that he finds in the neglected urban space. In the video, Lugo intently con­structs his potter’s wheel from what seems to be a spoke, hub­cap, rope, and an empty tin can. He sifts dirt from the lot, and pours a discarded 40-ounce beer over the unmolded mass, forging clay. Slapping his wet clay pot onto a graffiti-covered cement wall, Roberto can be heard reciting a poem: “I got my two hands up, one is up to ask a question, and the other is up ‘cause I have the answer –– to prove to you, I can make something beautiful out of dirt. I am ghetto. I am resourceful. I am brown.”

The commercial art world doesn’t always encourage mess­iness. Critics prefer stark white walls to the urban lot. Messy is the antithesis of Josef Albers: it’s the borders of the students’ murals crafted from scrap clay into intricate design. It’s the scene of nineteen teenagers frantically installing their work the day before the opening, doodling on empty space of the gallery walls. To Lugo and his students, it’s a source of pride.

**Title: HARD DRIVES, HARDER QUESTIONS**
**Author: Amber Hu**
**Page number(s): 6**

“Can you imagine what it might be like for a child whose parents are not allowed to be married?”

The day was March 26, 2007. Anna Heller, a 39-year-old social worker from Willimantic, Connecticut, tes­tified during a twelve-hour hearing before the Con­necticut legislature on H.B. 7395, which would grant same-sex couples in the state the right to marriage. She spoke on behalf of Love Makes a Family, an organiza­tion that lobbied for the bill. 

Heller’s testimony, and the rest Love Makes a Fam­ily’s records, are now housed at Yale Manuscripts and Archives, in the northeast wing of Sterling Memorial Library. More than sixteen miles of pages line the walls of the main reading room. But the Love Makes a Fam­ily archives aren’t found in the bound books lining the walls or folders stashed in the Library Shelving Facility; they sit in two desktop computers sitting patiently in the far-right corner, waiting to be dusted off and started up. “That’s where you’ll be working today,” the librar­ian at the reference desk said to me, gesturing towards the corner. 

After spending an hour skimming through dinner party planning correspondences by Love Makes a Fami­ly’s associate director, Carol Buckheit, I stumbled upon an email exchange in which she sent a copy of Hell­er’s testimony to a professional writer, Alison Cashin. I double-clicked on the Word document, waiting for the software to boot up. But what appeared was not a wall of black text; it was a red sheet full of cross-outs and underlines that covered the original draft like a heavy blanket.

To professional archivists, emails and Word doc­uments are more than lines of text on a computer screen; they are “born-digital” archives, materials cre­ated and preserved in a digital form—including audio recordings, floppy disks, digital musical scores, and entire hard drives and laptops. Two decades ago, Yale’s archives were limited to physical objects like books and manuscripts. Now, Yale owns the virtual records of contemporary public figures ranging from playwright Paula Vogel’s teaching files to poet Charles Bernstein’s academic emails. Archivists are becoming more inter­ested in born-digital materials, which often reveal cru­cial information missing from physical materials. This was certainly the case in Buckheit and Cashin’s emails:
Buckheit: Can I ask your wise counsel on one ques­tion on the attached? I’m afraid some of this reinforces that gays should not have kids because we are hurting them emotionally—what do you think?
Cashin: Oof. You’re totally right, Carol. As a rule, I try to avoid anything that can be seen as reinforcing stereotypes—this totally does that…we are trying to emphasize the messages that correspond to other testifiers’ messages. 

Buckheit and Cashin’s goal was simple: to frame Heller’s story in a more loving light, replacing phrases like “I wish I did not have to spend my adolescence in fear” with “I feel blessed with my mom’s love and support throughout my childhood.” Heller’s testimony was not a spontaneous release of emotions but a careful construction, crafted and approved by the organization to optimize Heller’s two short minutes in front of the judiciary committee.

The week before my library visit, I met with Mary Caldera, the head of arrangement and description at Manuscripts and Archives. She works with the archives of historically excluded groups, including ethnic minorities and LGBTQ communities. “A lot of the little off-hand correspondences used to be more formal,” Caldera said. “But now, most people have these phone conversations or write quick emails, which can be very informal and reveal a lot more about what they really mean.” By combing through essay drafts and brief emails, archivists uncover the author’s thought process. And because electronic material is often seen as dispos­able, born-digital archives serve as a repository for an author’s most private musings. For the testifiers of Love In Yale’s archives, digital records provide a new portal to the past.

Makes a Family, born-digital archives reveal sentiments 
in more detail than physical archives likely would. 
Caldera is one of four members of the Born Digi­
tal Working Group at Yale, created in January 2015 to 
devise guidelines and assemble resources for born-dig­
ital archives. “We want to make sure the libraries are 
able to store digital materials as well as we store all 
our other materials,” she said. One of the resources 
the group has incorporated is the Digital Accessioning 
Service, a collection of technological equipment used 
to redact personal information like Social Security and 
bank account numbers, scan for viruses, and capture 
files from digital media.

But employing high-tech preservation methods is 
not the only challenge the group faces. It must deal 
with issues when its forensic toolkit interferes with 
donors’ rights to privacy. To learn more about these 
ethical quandaries, I met with the Beinecke Library’s 
digital archivist Gabby Redwine at 344 Winchester 
Avenue, a long, sweeping building with lofty glass win­
dows, home to the Beinecke’s back-end technological 
services. Redwine is the first person at Yale whose job is 
entirely dedicated to born-digital archives. “One of the 
main issues that comes up is intentionality,” Redwine 
explained. “What sets born-digital apart from physical 
archives is that we can capture information from digital 
media that hasn’t been overwritten.” 

Redwine explained that when users drag their files 
into the trash bin, most think those files are beyond 
recovery. But really, the computer only deletes the 
file “pointer”—a roadmap that leads the computer to 
the file—while still keeping the file itself. This means 
when Redwine and her colleagues receive a hard drive, 
they can use the Beinecke’s forensic tools—which, she 
noted, are the same tools the FBI uses—to uncover 
mounds of deleted files that the donor may not have 
intended to hand over. When archivists work with 
materials from well-known cultural icons like Vogel or 
Bernstein, deleted files are a gold mine of novel drafts, 
essay fragments, and browsing histories. But, until 
they receive consent from the donor, they must follow 
library policy, abstaining from opening those gigabytes 
of potentially valuable but sensitive information.

The available born-digital archives are enough to 
give us a glimpse into the private lives of all sorts of 
people, from authors to activists to everyday citizens. 
Often, the most colloquial exchanges are the most 
striking. On October 10, 2008, more than one-and-a-
half years after Heller’s testimony, Buckheit received 
an email from Laurel Hoskins, a friend of Love Makes 
a Family, about a Connecticut Supreme Court ruling:
“I KNOW you are NOT sitting around your com­
puter right now because the decision JUST came down 
and Stephen and I are just THRILLED and you must 
be over the top! 4 to 3 decision is good enough. So what 
if all our money is in the toilet—start planning your 
weddings!”

THE  NEW  JOURNAL
WHO’S LAUGHING NOW?
S N A P S H O T
Women are at the center of a revolution in Yale’s comedy scene.

F
ive women strut onto a makeshift stage with a 
smug swagger. The audience that fills the audito­
rium in Yale’s Linsly-Chittenden Hall is already laughing. 
With their baseball caps tilted sideways on their heads—and 
scratching their nether regions—the performers lumber to a 
line of chairs.
“Do we really think it’s a good idea to be taking ‘men’ 
out of ‘comedy’?” asks Ned, played by Raffi Donatich, in an 
aggressively deep voice.
“Then it would just be ‘Cody’,” Fred, played by Sarah 
Al-Shalash, replies, screwing up her brow, so slack-jawed 
she’s almost drooling. The other characters nod vigorously.
Then, from Luke, Emma Chanen’s character: “Your 
mum’s a chode!”
Donatich and Chanen pantomime a ‘snip’, scissor-bang­
ing their fingers in celebration of their joke.
So began the ‘cold open’ of Disast-Her, an April 13 sketch, 
stand-up, and improv showcase featuring 20 women from 
Yale’s comedy scene. The opener imagined a group of Yale’s 
male comedians devising a rival showcase. The sketch skew­
ered bad dick jokes, misguided allyship (hoisting a woman 
up on your shoulders does not “elevate her voice,” guys) and 
problematic icons (Daniel Tosh, anyone?). But eviscerating 
the patriarchy wasn’t the night’s only aim. Other improv 
scenes invited the viewers to  worlds strewn with dead cows 
and broken treehouses; stand-up comedians told tales of 
study abroad misadventures and medical mishaps.

Two months prior, a newly-formed stand-up collective for 
women and non-binary comedians hosted its first event, The 
Coven Presents: We Just Said That. Jokes ranged from the 
cure for catcalling to being called out at the Colbert Report. 
This event, too, was a smashing success: stage managers had 
to turn away a long line of would-be audience members at 
the door of the Jonathan Edwards Theater.

Yale has a grand total of six sketch groups, five improv 
groups, two stand-up troupes (including The Coven) and a 
plethora of regular stand-up open mics. With the notable 
exception of shows by the Sphincter Troupe, a non-male 
sketch comedy group founded in 2001, rarely does a comedy 
line-up at Yale feature zero dudes. To The Coven’s founder, 
Chloe Prendergast, the two new non-male comedy line-ups 
that cropped up in a semester emerged from a new consensus 
about problems in Yale’s comedy scene. “The show proved 
that this kind of night had value,” she said.
ENTERING THE SCENE
Chloe Prendergast didn’t consider herself funny before 
coming to Yale. But when she became the Art Director of the 
Yale Record, the country’s oldest college humor magazine, 
she was told she didn’t need to be. Anyone can pitch a car­
toon; she just needed to approve the image.

Prendergast said it’s unlikely she would have said yes 
to stand-up without the encouragement of an experienced 
woman comedian, the Record’s then Editor-in-Chief, Rachel 
Lackner. Lackner was one of the few recurring woman per­
formers at Yale’s amateur open mic night, the Cucumber, 
and encouraged Prendergast to perform. Today, Prender­
gast is both the Record’s publisher and a staple on the Yale 
stand-up circuit. 

She’s not the only one. Grace Wynter, a stand-up come­
dian and member of the Sphincter Troupe, said, “When I 
was 14, I told my friend that I want to be the Black Tina 
Fey. I didn’t consider myself a funny person; I was just some­
one who liked comedy.” A personal outreach message from 
Sphincter motivated her to audition.

Zoë Loewenberg, the former director of musical improv 
group Just Add Water (of which I am also a member) was 
discouraged from comedy for another reason: “Improv is not 
cute. You don’t look hot doing improv. It’s high risk. Comedy 
is counter to my gender role.”

Just this year, at one set of auditions for stand-up troupe 
The Opening, fifteen men and one woman turned up. Lane 
Unsworth, director of the Cucumber, didn’t find that surpris­
ing. “I get reached out to by guys but I need to reach out to 
girls [when recruiting for shows],” she said. “Being a woman 
in charge made recruiting women much easier.”

And stand-up isn’t the only comedic extracurricular facing 
concerns about representation. A meta-scene performed by 
the sketch troupe Fifth Humour last year highlighted similar 
issues. The scene began with Addee Kim trying to recall her 
favorite sketch from a previous Fifth Humour show. She told 
cast member Zoe Ervolino that one of the performers was this 
“white guy, darkish hair and sort of Jewish.” That description 
didn’t narrow it down. So, on the command of her whistle, 
Ervolino summoned the male members of Fifth Humour to 
march shamefacedly onto the stage. The group resembled a 
police line-up: nine white, dark-haired men. While the bit 
was specific to Fifth Humour, the point it made speaks to 
racial and gender disparities in Yale’s comedy scene at large.

According to Prendergast, Last Comic Standing was the 
final catalyst in the creation of The Coven. Organized every 
year by the Yale College Council, Last Comic Standing 
offers any undergraduate comedian the chance to open for 
an established comic. The winners are determined both by 
YCC judges and popular vote. In last’s year’s competition, 
three of the seven finalists were women, but not one made it 
into the top three. “I very much disagreed with the outcome 
of that show,” says Prendergast. “And I wasn’t the only one.” 
For her, this result reinforced a truth about Yale comedy: 
Women aren’t just underrepresented, they’re underappreci­
ated too. That same night, the idea for The Coven was born.
“THAT’S NOT A PHONE, IT’S A BANANA”
Not only are women discouraged from entering the Yale 
comedy scene: once they join, they often face unique diffi­
culties. To foster collaboration and world-building onstage, 
for instance, many improvisers have been taught a cardinal 
rule: “Make your partner look good.” But woman improvisers 
at Yale say they can’t always count on their male counterparts 
to follow it.

In a “long-form” game at one group’s show a few years 
ago, the premise was a madcap one. To tie up the ending of 
the story, one character needed another character’s eyes. But 
a male performer had developed a joke about his character 
refusing to give away his cornea. A woman improviser tried to 
end the story, but the male performer denied her because his 
‘cornea’ joke was getting a lot of laughs, making the woman 
the butt of the joke rather than its architect. Zoe Ervolino, 
the brains behind the Disast-Her showcase, a member of 
Fifth Humour, and director of an improv group, The Viola

of ‘wouldn’t it be so nice and new,’” said former member 
Anna Piwowar, who graduated this spring. “To Sphincter, it’s 
not. This is our lived experience of writing sketches. It’s hard 
for me to imagine what it would be like in a room where 
that’s not the case.”
In Sphincter rehearsals, every suggestion is applauded; 
no idea is shot down. “We’re not writing for the intention of 
being funny to everyone. We write to the intention of what 
we believe in,” said member Yuni Chang, who graduated in 
May. Members still joke about a Bulldog Days Show where 
they performed a sketch about hypermasculine culture at 
Goldman Sachs and another about a woman getting eggs 
sucked out of her uterus—to radio silence from the audience.
More than half of Sphincter’s line-up is made up of 
women of color. But improviser Lillian Ekem, a member 
of Purple Crayon who participated in Disast-Her, expressed 
some concerns about the showcase’s lack of racial diversity. 
“As a woman of color going to these rehearsals of improv, it’s 
been mostly white,” she said. “At a place where I’m supposed 
to feel part of the majority, I’m still a minority.” 
Ervolino and Prendergast are aware of that the spaces 
Question, said this is a common phenomenon. “‘That’s not 
a phone, it’s a banana.’ The person who says that is a man in 
my mind,” she said.
Sometimes audiences only reinforce this dilemma, 
according to Ervolino. She came up with a theory about what 
she calls ‘the frat boy laugh.’ “When a joke ‘goes well’, we’re 
listening to the loudest people laughing,” she said. And, 
according to Ervolino, men are often the loudest laughers. 
When an audience is dominated by male laughter, a joke at 
men’s expense might not go over well. In one case at a Just 
Add Water improv show last semester, a group of men in the 
audience audibly live commented the show, pointing out the 
women they found unfunny or unattractive.
In a sign of progress in Yale’s comedy scene, women’s 
leadership of comedy groups has been on the rise. Last year, 
four of the five mixed-gender sketch groups on campus—
Red Hot Poker, Fifth Humour, The Good Show, and Odd 
Ducks—were directed by women, along with four of the five 
improv groups. 
On a Wednesday evening in April, five female comedy 
directors trickled into a room in the Center for Teaching and 
Learning. They greeted each other with warm smiles and 
generous laughter. And as our conversation about director­
ship warmed up, they nodded eagerly at their shared expe­
riences.
“I’ve never seen a message in the GroupMe from a woman 
asking what time or where rehearsal is,” said Emma Chanen, 
director of the Good Show. “The men struggle to consult 
resources and make it happen for themselves.”
Raffi Donatich, then director of Red Hot Poker, jumped 
in: “Literally last semester, one member of my group––whom 
I love––goes, ‘When is the show?’ and I’m like, ‘Tonight! In 
hours!’ We’d been rehearsing all week!” As they laugh, it’s 
clear this is all too familiar.
“It’s hard because I’m so bad at logistics,” Tessa Palter-Pos­
ton, director of improv group Purple Crayon, confesses. “But 
at least I have frequent shame about it.”
Then, there’s the question of how women should go about 
leading in majority-male spaces. Chanen again: “I take up 
a f***-ton of space in Good Show. I’m unapologetic about 
that. They’re welcome for the feedback.” However, when she 
finds that members of her group have been talking over her 
for ten minutes straight, “I wonder if that would be the same 
if I were a man.” Hums of agreement emerge from the other 
directors.
Donatich also noted that the family culture of Yale com­
edy groups led to ‘mommification’, a term for when women 
directors are treated as maternal figures rather than leaders. 
Outside the meeting, Ervolino voiced concerns with how 
men and women handle sensitive material. The burden of 
initiating discourse often falls on women.
“When anything is available to be made into a joke, there 
are a lot of opportunities to mess up,” Ervolino said. “It’s hard 
to be the only one bothered [by insensitivity]. Just because 
a space is comfortable and everyone is close doesn’t mean 
that certain things are allowed.” As rush season began this 
fall, Ervolino asked to withdraw a sketch about gay women, 
written by a straight man, that she felt could alienate the 
audience and prospective members. She also started con­
versations on ensuring women get funny parts on stage and 
using gender-neutral character names.
For a non-male group like Sphincter, these types of prob­
lems are rarer. “The language [of Disast-Her] had an element

they’ve cultivated still reflect issues of representation within 
the comedy scene. “It’s a very white group of women. That’s 
something about comedy in general and comedy at Yale,” 
Ervolino said. Similarly, despite their efforts at inclusivity, 
neither event has hosted a non-binary or trans performer. “It’s 
weird to know that this is already a failure, in some aspects,” 
Ervolino said. But, she added, a more inclusive comedy 
scene “needs to start somewhere.”
THE SHOWCASE
The night of Disast-Her, LC101 was packed to the brim. 
The line outside snaked to the basement toilets. Audience 
members cheered performers’ names before the show had 
even started. Backstage, Ervolino anxiously paced between 
rooms. Improvisers were warming up, sketch performers 
were fine-tuning, and the stand-up comics sat in the audi­
ence, nervously reviewing their sets. But once Ervolino sat 
down to watch, her anxieties dissipated. “The whole point 
of the showcase was that these women knew what they were 
doing,” she said.
At the warm-up, even the woman house manager joined 
in. Much like at the very first meeting, no one introduced 
themselves by what group they were in. Performers from 
each group shared their respective warm-up rituals, some­
thing comedians at Yale are often fiercely secretive about. 
But not tonight. These performers were part of a community. 
Just before the improvisers took to the stage, a growing 
ruckus echoed from the corridors of LC. It was one word 
being repeated over and over again: “Women. Women! 
Women! WOMEN!” As they ran out onto the stage, the 
crowd roared, then sat back to listen.

On a layover in El Salvador, I noticed the

the old man by the window, a woman digging 
through her purse, the child coming out of the 
bathroom. I felt flattered until I heard, “¿Quién es

China: a small porcelain doll on display for the

I grew up reading the Western classics in 
Korean. They came in full-shelf packages: Les 
Miserablés, Little Women, King Lear, translated 
to satiate a child’s growing mind.

When the words were finally read to me in their 
original form, I cried because I did not know how 
to pronounce Gloucester.


They say the term gook originated from 
mi-guk, the Korean word for America. My people 
shouted mi-guk! at the pale-faced, jeep-roaring, 
gum-chewing liberators, pointed and hollered 
mi-guk! the way our white saviors have come to 
shout gook.

Gook: flat-faced, stub-nosed, slit-eyed, yel­

it be their delicate, playful personalities? I believe 
it is all of the above.” 


A boy once recited Keats to me, as if he

I was there for the revival of Miss Saigon. 
Under the bright lights of a fictitious Saigon, the 
carnage of a 1975 bar scene unfolded before my 
eyes. I dwelled on the deranged romanticism of 
living through the ‘Nam, the unapologetic vulgar­
ity of scantily-clad, stick-skinny women prancing 
around with topless G.I.s. 

I wonder what it feels like to be thrown around. 
To be humped, cheaply bent over, to offer my 
every move to a man. 


I was sitting in the passenger seat of a red 
Toyota Corolla, facing a boy whose arms were 
intertwined with mine. It was well past curfew 
but making out in empty parking lots is a favorite 
American pastime. 

He flashed me a smile in the way that well-mean­
ing boys do before muttering, “I love when you do 
your hair like that. It just looks so—I don’t know. 
Elegant? Like a geisha or something. I like it.” 


“Do you have a boyfriend?” My mom 
asked one day.

“No, not really.” A white lie.

“That’s okay. Just don’t bring home a boy with

During World War II, the Japanese 
snatched young girls from their homes in Korea 
and shipped them off in boatloads to barracks 
across the Pacific. Comfort women, we call them. 
They lay, teeth clenched, under the weight of the

Comfort (n.): “a state of physical ease and 
freedom from pain or constraint.” A state of physi­

In Miss Saigon’s Dreamland sequence, 
one of the “girls,” Gigi, resists the advances of an 
American G.I. While he is impatient to undress 
her, she desperately tries to convince him to take 
her to America. He replies, “Oh, come on. Not 
tonight!” To which she pleads, “But I’ll make a 
good wife!” 

The bar owner walks over, slaps Gigi, and 
throws her to the ground. To ease the sudden rise 
in tension accompanied by a musical halt, he says: 
“It’s alright, gentlemen. It’s just Gigi. You know 
she likes it rough.”


The Japanese men who loved geishas colo­
nized women who look like me—their lords once 
ruled my mother tongue and land. They ripped 
the sangtu off the heads of my fathers, exposing 
scalp, snipping away a reverence for our ancestors 
as they tossed hair-knots to the ground. 


I wonder if Gigi really does like it rough. 
Did Vietnam like it rough when American sol­
diers fell from the sky? 


I like being choked in bed. I like the feel­
ing of fingers around my throat, of careful asphyx­
iation, of having the breath crushed out of me – I 
giggle.


I keep thinking maybe I like it rough the 
way Gigi likes it rough, and perhaps the real tro­
phy of war is this doubt they’ve managed to cast.

I.     THE EAST END
When he first heard about the casino, Dr. Charlie Stallworth, a Connecticut state representative and the pastor of 
East End Baptist Tabernacle Church in 
Bridgeport, was skeptical. He didn’t think 
the developer, MGM Resorts International, was serious 
about the project, and he didn’t like the advertising campaign they were running. “Maybe I’m not the brightest guy 
in the room,” he remembers thinking, “but don’t try and 
manipulate me.” So, last September, when Stallworth heard 
about a press conference and groundbreaking ceremony in 
a vacant lot on the waterfront, he stayed away: “How are you 
going to have a groundbreaking for something that’s illegal 
to build?”

A few construction workers wore hard hats for the cameras, but the event that morning wasn’t really a groundbreaking. There were no shovels. Instead, standing in a tent 
beside artists’ depictions of a glitzy complex with yachts 
parked out front, Jim Murren, MGM’s president and CEO 
and a Bridgeport native, said construction could start on a 
$675-million resort and casino as soon as the state passed a 
bill to make it legal. “The idea of being able to bring thousands of jobs, hundreds of millions of dollars in investment, 
to a city where I was born that needs this so desperately is 
very rewarding for me,” he said.

The site MGM had chosen was in the East End neighborhood, three blocks from Stallworth’s church: a patch of 
concrete on an old industrial channel in Bridgeport Harbor. 
This spot was now the center of a battle over where—and 
whether—Connecticut would open its first casino off a Native American reservation. MGM was already on track to 
spend more than $4.7 million on lobbying and associated 
costs within 18 months. Only recently, the gambling titan 
had sued Connecticut, attempting to block a similar proposal from the state’s two federally recognized Native American tribes, the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation and the 
Mohegan Tribe (both of which already operate casinos on 
their reservations). Now, it was launching a charm offensive: 
community meetings, union rallies, donations to nonprofits 
and scholarship funds, talks at Rotary clubs, web and TV ad­
vertising, and glossy brochures mailed to homes in Bridgeport and New Haven. “Support 7,000 total jobs,” one brochure said, “at no cost to taxpayers.” The state’s two largest 
cities were each promised something. Bridgeport would get 
$8 million a year for hosting the casino, MGM promised. 
New Haven would get a jobs-training center. And Connecticut would get $50 million up front in licensing fees before 
the first card was dealt.

Back in September, Stallworth had his doubts about the 
casino. But he knew his city was struggling. “Bridgeport has 
been stereotyped as that place where bad things happen,” 
he said. “We have to change that.” Once a proud producer 
of everything from sewing machines and luxury cars to bayonets and rifles, Bridgeport flourished during World War II 
but began losing jobs and residents soon after.

Deindustrialization in the ‘70s and ‘80s hit the city hard. 
Crack, crime, and suburban flight made things worse. By 
1990, Bridgeport’s murder rate was the highest in New England. Its budget was deep in the red. According to Stallworth, Bridgeport still hasn’t fully recovered. “Just to ride 
through the neighborhood, you see trash, you see sidewalks 
broken,” he said. “If I were sixteen, I don’t know if that 
would motivate me to try to push forward in my life.”

Stallworth met with MGM executives at his church early 
this year to hear their pitch. The jobs and revenue projections they quoted got his attention. “Bridgeport has not had 
an economic boost, or a jobs boost, since who knows when,” 
he said. And he appreciated that their plans included some 
family-friendly entertainment options, like a theater and 
a boardwalk mall. By spring, he concluded that MGM 
Bridgeport was the city’s best chance for a rebound.

Reverend Christopher Leighton thought differently. 
Leighton, the priest at St. Mark’s, an Episcopal church 
about two blocks from Dr. Stallworth’s church, opposed 
the casino from the start. His grandfather, a well-to-do accountant, lost everything to illicit gambling and left his son, 
Leighton’s father, in crushing debt. Leighton’s father took 
out his bitterness on his children. “I remember being beaten 
by my father for nothing,” the priest told me. “It’s a drama 
I wish I never had to go through.” A grandfather himself 
now, Leighton helps run a summer bible school for East 
End kids. “I don’t want to see the kids we’re trying to help 
get sucked into a life that could destroy them,” he said.

Stallworth’s support for the casino, Leighton said, probably stems from his thinking as an elected official, pursuing 
Bridgeport’s economic interests rather than following his 
heart as a preacher. “I’ve heard people say, who are in support of the casino, ‘We need the money,’” Leighton said. “But 
what are you going to do with that money? You can’t buy 
back your soul.”

port of it, ‘You can’t legislate morality,’ Leighton said. “It’s 
like, wait a minute, we do that all the time: ‘Thou shalt not 
kill.’”

But Stallworth said he feels no tension between politics 
and faith on this issue. “I’m in the same place as a pastor, as 
a person, as a politician,” he said. “I support it. I have stood 
in my church and said, ‘I’m looking forward for it to come.’ 
I hope it comes.”

By March, the two East End pastors were manning op­
posite sides of the barricades. Stallworth signed on as a 
sponsor of House Bill 5305, which would set up a bidding 
process for a new casino with requirements roughly tracking 
MGM’s proposal. Leighton, meanwhile, joined the Con­
necticut Coalition Against Casino Expansion (CACE) and 
testified against the bill. “Gambling may be entertaining for 
some,” he said at a legislative hearing, “but for many whose 
stories are too shameful to tell, gambling causes casualties.”

Leighton told me opposing the casino can feel isolating. 
His impression is that the overwhelming majority of Bridge­
port residents want it. (In a poll of registered Bridgeport vot­
ers MGM commissioned last fall, 74 percent said they were 
in favor.) Michele Mudrick, one of the coalition’s founders, 
said CACE is outmatched financially as well. “It’s like a Da­
vid and Goliath fight we have here,” Mudrick told me in 
April. “We have $800 in the bank[…] and they’re literally 
spending hundreds of thousands of dollars.”

In May, as the 2018 legislative session closed, Stallworth’s 
bill passed the Connecticut House of Representatives. Four 
days later, short on votes, the bill’s sponsors in the Senate 
withdrew it, promising to come back stronger in 2019. In 
another round of direct-mail flyers later that month, MGM 
vowed to continue the fight. “With support from people 
like you,” the flyer said, “we are closer than ever” to victory. 
Since then, the battlefield has gone quiet. But both sides are 
preparing for the bill’s return.    


**Connecticut Casinos: A Shifting Landscape**

II.   UNCASVILLE
On the winding route to Mohe­
gan Sun, one of two casinos that tow­
er over the oak and hickory forests of 
southeastern Connecticut, the snow is 
falling heavier now and sticking. It’s a Wednesday night in 
March, and I’ve taken a wrong turn onto a road the plows 
haven’t reached. Cars move slowly, following each other’s 
tire-tracks. Others have given up, or drifted too far onto the 
shoulder; they wait in the darkness, hazard lights blinking. 
It’s supposed to snow like this until morning.

It’s warm inside the casino, where there are no windows 
to gauge the weather outside. The gambling floor is vast, 
spanning more than 300,000 square feet. In one section, 
simulated stars dot the ceiling. In another, animatronic 
wolves turn their heads as if scanning for prey. The flashing 
lights on slot machines—old ones, squat with metal han­
dles, and new ones shaped like giant smartphones—blur in 
the cigarette smoke and artificial waterfall mist.

Melissa, who declined to give her last name, got off work 
about an hour ago. She’s slouched in her seat, watching a 
video interlude on a “Sex and the City” slot machine. Later 
tonight, she’ll brave the roads home to North Stonington, 
where her two kids are waiting. I ask why she’s here. “Be­
cause I work at the other one,” she responds. “I can’t gamble 
there.”

The other one is Foxwoods Resort Casino, 10 miles away 
on the Mashantucket Pequot Reservation. When it opened 
in 1992, Foxwoods was the only casino in New England; 
within a few years, it was the world’s largest. The Mohe­
gans—relatives and onetime enemies of the Mashantucket 
Pequots—received federal recognition as a tribe in 1994, 
and opened Mohegan Sun here in Uncasville two years 
later. For the next decade, this corner of Connecticut at­
tracted gamblers from all over the East Coast. Back then, an 
old-timer at the penny slots told me, there was a line behind 
every machine.

Slot machines are illegal in Connecticut. But on tribal 
lands, state gambling restrictions, like indoor smoking laws, 
apply differently. Back in the ‘90s, the state promised the 
tribes a monopoly on slots; in return, the tribes would pay 
Connecticut 25 percent of their slot-machine winnings. The 
state’s most profitable year was 2006—payments for that 
year totaled $430 million. Then came the financial crisis. 
By 2012, Foxwoods was $2.3 billion in debt. The Mohegans 
owed $1.6 billion. And they were encircled by competitors: 
New casinos had popped up in Rhode Island, New York, 
Pennsylvania, and Maine.

With more regional rivals, Connecticut’s casinos have 
since shrunk their gambling floors and expanded into tamer 
forms of entertainment: an outlet mall, an expo center, a 
33-story zip-line, a WNBA team. As of late 2016, Foxwoods 
and Mohegan Sun employed 43 percent fewer people than 
in 2006. The two casinos still accounted for over 13,000 
jobs, and operated more than 7,000 slot machines. But last 
year, those machines won the state just $270 million.

Dr. Clyde Barrow, a University of Texas economist who 
consults for the tribes, told me the number of casinos in the 
Northeast has exploded since 2006—from 12 to nearly 70. 
 “I’ve heard people say, who are 
in support of it, ‘You can’t leg­
islate morality,’ Leighton said. 
“It’s like, wait a minute, we do 
that all the time: ‘Thou shalt 
not kill.’”

off eight hundred employees, the Pequots stopped paying 
stipends to tribal members, forcing some families to rely on 
a communal food bank. (In the boom years, those annual 
stipends had exceeded $100,000 for each adult.)


Chuck Bunnell, the Mohegan Tribe’s chief of staff, told 
me he thinks MGM Bridgeport will never materialize. “Ob­
viously, let’s hope it doesn’t,” he said. “But, if we’re being 
honest with each other, we have to accept that that would 
cause layoffs and be devastating for this region of the state.” 
And adjusting for competition from MGM Springfield is 
“inevitable,” Bunnell said. The tribes will try to keep down­
sized workers employed until the East Windsor casino 
opens—2020 at the earliest—so they can transfer there, he 
said. Although most employees aren’t members of the tribe, 
Bunnell said, the Mohegans “consider their employees part 
of their extended family.”


But transferring to East Windsor, halfway across the 
state, isn’t an option for Melissa. “I have thought about it,” 
she said, “but I’m divorced and I have two kids. The travel 
would take too big of a toll.”


III. BARNUM AVENUE
Nick Roussas, the owner of Frankie’s 
Diner in Bridgeport, started out bussing 
tables at the age of 9.  By 12 he was cook­
ing burgers and fries on the line. Now, 
at 41, Roussas is the president of the neighborhood redevel­
opment zone, a marshal for the Juneteenth parade, and a 
board member for six nonprofits. He’s also a near-daily pres­
ence at the diner, where he works at least 50 hours a week. 
Roussas has three rules for conversations with custom­
ers: “You don’t take sides on religion, politics, or baseball.” 
He bends two of them. It’s no secret that Roussas is a die-
hard Yankees fan. He’s taken a side in the casino debate, 
too. “Why can’t we have something like the Yankees here in 


And more are coming. MGM Springfield, a billion-dollar 
gambling resort, opened in Massachusetts last month. Wynn 
is building a casino near Boston. Over the summer, MGM 
bought a century-old racetrack and slot parlor in Yonkers, 
New York, which industry observers expect will expand 
dramatically. To compete, the Connecticut tribes plan to 
construct a “satellite” casino in East Windsor, Connecti­
cut—just 17 miles from Springfield. The idea, which won 
the legislature’s approval in 2016, is to intercept gamblers 
heading north for the border.


According to MGM, a casino in Bridgeport will do the 
same things, but better, potentially earning Connecticut 
more than Foxwoods and Mohegan combined. Bridgeport 
is closer to major population hubs like New York. But a casi­
no there would break Connecticut’s compact with the tribes 
and throw the future of Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun into 
doubt.


Melissa believes workers like her will suffer no matter 
what happens. “The more casinos you have,” she said, “the 
worse it is for us.” She’s been at Foxwoods for 17 years, off 
and on, and remembers the downturn when Twin River 
Casino opened an hour away in Rhode Island. “There’ll be 
layoffs,” she predicted.


Dr. Barrow’s data support Melissa’s fears. “There’s no 
doubt,” he said, “that if you open a third casino in Con­
necticut, some of its revenues will be cannibalized” from 
Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun. In a 2015 study, Dr. Barrow’s 
consulting firm predicted that increased competition could 
cost the two casinos as many as 5,800 jobs by 2019. The 
only downturn approaching that scale to date was during the 
Great Recession. Hundreds of workers and tribal members 
lost their livelihoods then. In 2010, still insolvent after laying

money. But he hopes the promised jobs will trigger a chain 
reaction. Bridgeporters will go back to work. They’ll buy 
houses instead of renting. They’ll raise their kids here, send­
ing them to schools improved and beautified with casino 
money. They’ll have what Roussas calls “pride of owner­
ship.” They’ll be happier. 
“That’s all it takes—one thing like this to spark things up,” 
Roussas said. “That’s what we’re looking for.”


Thirty miles north on Highway 8, in 
Waterbury, another former factory town, 
Scott Nelson thinks a casino will affect 
his city, too. Nelson is the director of 
problem gambling services for Midwestern Connecticut 
Council of Alcoholism, an addiction treatment center here.
“If you’re within a fifty-five-mile radius of a casino,” Nel­
son told me, “your chances of developing a gambling issue 
go up.” In a 1999 report to Congress, the National Gambling 
Impact Study Commission cited evidence that problem and 
pathological gambling were twice as prevalent within fifty 
miles of a casino. Recent studies have found a similar cor­
relation. Nelson explains this in terms of access. “The more 
accessible gambling is, the more people tend to participate 
in it,” he said. “And once you are in that environment, cer­
tain risk factors have the opportunity to take hold.”


Right now, lottery scratchers are the biggest problem for 
Nelson’s gambling clients. Fantasy sports betting is growing. 
If a casino opened in Bridgeport—fifty-five minutes away 
by train or thirty minutes by car—Nelson would anticipate 
more clients with slot-machine addictions. But he wouldn’t 
expect them right away. “Nobody goes to the casino for the 
first time, loses more than they intended, and then immedi­
ately walks in the door to see us,” he said. “There’s a pattern 
of problems over months, years—decades in some cases—
before they’re able to get through the door to see us.”


Melodie Keen, the director of outpatient services at Con­
necticut Renaissance, a behavioral therapy center in Nor­
walk, agreed. “By the time I see people,” she said, “they’ve 
lost everything.”


If MGM Bridgeport opens, Nelson believes the patients 
at his clinic will be especially vulnerable. Some have crimi­
nal records. Many are people of color. Few are affluent. All 
these factors put them at a higher risk for gambling addic­
tion, he said. Research bears out Nelson’s concern. Accord­
ing to a paper by Dr. Timothy Fong of the UCLA Gambling 
Studies Program, lower socioeconomic status correlates 
with more severe gambling problems, and African-Ameri­
cans, Latinos, Asians, and American Indians are all overrep­
resented among pathological gamblers—as are individuals 
with a history of substance abuse.


“But it can happen to anyone,” said Keen. Her Norwalk 
clients include high rollers ferried to casinos in private jets 
or limos and given complimentary suites once they arrive.


Representative Juan Candelaria of New Haven, who 
co-sponsored the casino bill last session, said he was sym­
pathetic to concerns about gambling problems but that it’s 
ultimately a question of individual autonomy. “I mean, no 
one is obligated to gamble,” he told me. 


“We make that choice,” Rep. Candelaria added. “And 
yes, opening up the casino opens up, probably, the ability 
for the individuals to go and gamble, but at the end of the 
day, it’s the individual’s choice.” 


Many Americans feel that way, said Nelson, the Water­
bury clinician. In a recent poll, 51 percent of respondents 
named “moral weakness” as a likely cause of gambling ad­
diction. But the idea that gambling addiction involves more 
of a choice—and thus more of a personal failing—than drug 
addiction is false, Nelson said. “I always think about it this 
way,” he said. “If somebody with a gambling addiction could 
bottle up that feeling they get from sitting at the card table, 
put it into a syringe, and inject it into their arms so they 
didn’t have to leave the house to go to the table, they would 
do that.”


Some MGM backers have argued that the potential harm 
to a small number of individuals with gambling addictions 
shouldn’t stop Bridgeport and Connecticut from collecting 
the revenue they need. “I talk to a lot of people who deal 
with a lot of things,” Stallworth, the pastor, told me, “and I 
think I’ve had one person who said to me, you know, ‘I have 
a gambling problem.’” 


Meanwhile, Rep. Candelaria said, casinos work for every­
one else. “That revenue is creating not only jobs,” Rep. Can­
delaria said, but also “going to different areas, where people 
will benefit at the end of the day.”


Nelson compared this framing to the arguments drug 
manufacturers have advanced to avoid liability for fueling 
the opiate epidemic. “‘We developed this medicine in good 
faith, and if some people misused it and it led them to her­
oin, that’s not our problem’,” he said. While gambling ad­
diction doesn’t lead to overdoses, it can be lethal. As many 
as one in five compulsive gamblers—a higher rate than any 
other addiction—attempt suicide, according to statistics 
from the National Council on Problem Gambling.


According to Dr. Earl Grinols, an economist at Baylor 
University who has studied casinos’ social costs, gambling 
addiction will likely claim more victims if Bridgeport gets its 
casino. “Some of them will commit suicide,” he said. “Some 
of them will engage in crime, like embezzlement. There’s 
no doubt it’s going to cause those things. The question is, is 
that at a level that’s acceptable to the state of Connecticut?”


But where casinos are concerned, Nelson suggested, 
Connecticut may have passed the point of coolly weighing 
risks and benefits. The state hit a kind of jackpot once be­
fore, winning millions in revenue from Foxwoods and Mo­
hegan Sun. Now, as competition increases and money gets 
tighter, lawmakers want to try their luck again. 


A potent psychological factor in gambling addiction, Nel­
son said, is “the fantasy of gambling creating a life-changing 
event.” It’s unique to gambling, and it’s one reason casinos 
can be so compelling—both for individual gamblers and for 
the cities and states that host casinos. “Nobody with an alco­
hol addiction can pick up a beer and think to themselves, ‘If 
I drink this next beer, my life can be drastically changed,’” 
he said. But gamblers can dream. So can Bridgeport.

tried to evict her, she says. She was forced out of her 
apartment—although it was never formalized—and was 
briefly homeless. Then she landed a spot in the Robert 
T. Wolfe Apartments.


Years after the surgery, the swelling in her knee has 
never really gone down, Luysterborghs says. She still has 
trouble walking. Sometimes the cramps in her legs are 
so bad that she can’t get out of bed in the morning.


When Luysterborghs moved into the Robert T. Wolfe 
Apartments, her rent was $59 a month. She prioritized 
it, and paid it on time. At the end of last year, though, 
her disability assistance went up, increasing her rent to 
$202. Her case manager at a local behavioral therapy 
program informed the Housing Authority of the change. 
But the paperwork confused Luysterborghs, and she 
accidentally submitted her old Social Security informa­
tion. The Housing Authority discovered the error after 
she’d paid the original rent, Luysterborghs says. And 
suddenly it was too late.


In January, she found an eviction notice affixed to her 
front door, informing her that she hadn’t paid her $202 
rent for that month. She had three weeks to leave.


Over the next few months, Luysterborghs met with 
her property manager to resolve the issue and paid her 
outstanding rent. But her case continued to advance 
through the court system, and the eviction loomed. 
Eventually, a hearing at housing court was set for the 
end of April.


“It’s been hectic because I’ve been dealing with a 
lot of depression, a lot of stuff,” Luysterborghs says the 
day before her hearing, sitting at China King, a takeout 
restaurant on Chapel Street.


Sixty years old, Luysterborghs has a wide face and 
blue eyes that quickly lift with an easy smile and, just 
as quickly, collapse into sadness. She grew up on the 
eastern edge of New Haven and attended Wilbur Cross 
High School. When she was a child, her mother bal­
anced three jobs.  Luysterborghs has worked all her life, 
too. She raised three sons, one of whom just got out 
of rehab. The youngest drowned in 2011 at the age of 
twenty-one. And even as she faces eviction proceedings, 
she’s been taking care of her two-month-old grandson 
every day. If she is evicted, she will lose her spot in pub­
lic housing. And there’s no other place waiting for her.


“I’m upset about what I’m going through,” Luyster­
borghs says. Through the plate glass windows of China 
King, she can almost make out the white gleam of the 
New Haven County Courthouse, where she’s scheduled 
to appear the next morning. “I’m going through stress, 
I’m going through back pain. I cry.”


For Luysterborghs, the prospect of an eviction is 
frightening, overwhelming, and isolating. But eviction 
has become commonplace for the city’s poorest rent­
ers. The Eviction Lab, a nationwide database of over 
eighty-three million eviction records, estimates that four 
evictions occur in New Haven every day, reflecting the 
pervasiveness of housing instability and poverty on the 
municipal and national levels. And comprehensive solu­
tions may be a long way off.



**Title: FORCED OUT**
**Page number(s): 23-24**

The eviction process begins with a Notice to Quit Pos­
session, like the one Luysterborghs found on her door. 
Every week, New Haven County State Marshal Brian 
Mezick serves dozens of notices to tenants across the 
city. Eviction papers—most of which stem from nonpay­
ment of rent—launch tenants into a legal process that 
most navigate without an attorney.


Mezick is in his thirties, a clean-shaven man with 
short blonde hair and slight sideburns. He’s been a state 
marshal for the past two years, handling evictions for pri­
vate landlords and the New Haven Housing Authority. 
If a defendant fails to appear in housing court, or loses 
her case, she can be evicted in about four weeks. Other 
times, cases can drag on for many months. If a judge 
upholds an eviction, Mezick oversees the removal pro­
cess.


There’s a certain boyishness about Mezick, who often 
shows up to evictions wearing a brown bomber jacket 
with a sheepskin collar and dark boots. But the state 
marshal ID hanging around his neck betrays the reason 
for his presence on tenants’ doorsteps. “I’m not there to 
be a cowboy, an enforcer, overly hostile. I try to speak 
in calm, low tones,” he says. “I make sure the landlord 
is not on the premises—there’s no need to agitate the 
situation.”


One April morning, at an eviction at a Housing 
Authority apartment near West Rock, Mezick watches as 
the movers work quickly, carrying armfuls of a woman’s 
possessions out the door.


The movers have an easy rapport with him, laughing 
and trading stories about eviction work as they disman­
tle the woman’s home. There was the one with roaches. 
The hoarder. Mezick tells them about a case a few days 
earlier, where a tenant in West Haven barricaded his 
door and threatened to shoot anyone who came in.


“That’s the scary thing. You never know what people 
are going through,” one of the movers says. “We had this 
guy, we’re five minutes from his house, and the road’s 
all blocked off. House is going up in flames. The guy 
had set it on fire and then shot himself.” He pushes a 
few boxes onto a hand truck and wheels it out the door.


During an eviction in New Haven, tenants who can’t 
afford private storage have their possessions packed onto 
a truck that is unloaded at the Department of Public 
Works’ Eviction Warehouse, located in a corner of the 
old Goffe Street Armory. Unlike some other cities, New 
Haven does not charge storage fees, but items that hav­
en’t been retrieved within a month are auctioned off 
wholesale to the public.


Only about a tenth of tenants pick up their posses­
sions, according to warehouse manager Shawn Brown. 
Often, elderly people who have been evicted don’t 
want to tell their families what’s happening, or cannot 
coordinate the pickup. “Sometimes it’s pride, shame, or 
they’ve been sick,” Brown says. She doesn’t like to sell 
people’s items because “some things can’t be replaced.” 
But anything that isn’t claimed goes up for auction.



**Title: A CITY IN CRISIS**
**Page number(s): 24**

New Haven is particularly vulnerable to what 
is increasingly seen as a nationwide eviction 
crisis. The city has a 4.05 percent eviction 
rate, according to the Eviction Lab, meaning 
that roughly four in every one hundred renter 
households are evicted. 


At an auction one morning in April, two men show up 
to bid. Brown leads them through the warehouse, where 
pallets of shrink-wrapped possessions sit in plywood 
bays. The two bidders pass their flashlight beams over 
a pallet piled high with chairs—a translucent iceberg of 
things left behind.


Nothing can be opened before purchase, so bidders 
make their best guesses about the value of the items 
within the boxes and pallets. Anything that doesn’t sell 
at the auction is taken to the Transfer Station in Quin­
nipiac Meadows, New Haven’s landfill.


“Yeah, I’ll take this for ten bucks,” says one of the bid­
ders as he inspects a pallet. He has attended auctions at 
the warehouse every month for a decade. He sells other 
people’s former possessions at local flea markets. “I just 
buy,” he says. “It’s all about the gamble.” By the end of 
the auction, he’s spent $360 on thirty-five pallets, and 
will bring a 26-foot U-Haul to take it all away.


For the bidders, the auction is a chance to hit the 
jackpot on an unassuming pallet: a well-made piece of 
furniture, a box of high-quality electronics, sometimes 
even a stash of money forgotten in the chaos of an evic­
tion. But for tenants, it’s the end of a fast-moving process 
that threatens to strip them of their home and posses­
sions.


New Haven is particularly vulnerable to what is 
increasingly seen as a nationwide eviction crisis. The 
city has a 4.05 percent eviction rate, according to the 
Eviction Lab, meaning that roughly four in every one 
hundred renter households are evicted. In 2016, with 
1,823 cases filed and 1,481 evictions carried out, New 
Haven had the 69th highest rate of eviction for Amer­
ican cities. Of nearby Connecticut cities with simi­
lar populations, Waterbury had a 6.1 percent eviction 
rate—the twenty-second highest in the country—with 
1,437 evictions in 2016. Stamford, with 453 evictions, 
did not make the top 100.


In New Haven, the scars of 1960s-era urban renewal 
remain unhealed. A dilapidated housing stock, high 
housing costs, and entrenched poverty keeps home 
ownership out of reach for most city residents. Accord­
ing to the Partnership for Strong Communities, a Hart­
ford-based affordable housing nonprofit, the median 
income for a New Haven renter household is $28,380, 
and more than half of renters spend 30 percent or more 
of their income on housing. State budget cuts, which 
have depleted resources for eviction-prevention pro­
grams, have further exacerbated the crisis.


New Haven evictions are concentrated in Edgewood, 
Newhallville, Fair Haven, and the Hill, some of the 
city’s poorest neighborhoods, according to Billy Huang, 
a researcher for the New Haven Legal Assistance Associ­
ation (LAA). The eviction crisis in those neighborhoods 
has its roots in their own fraught histories. Beginning in 
the nineteen-thirties, in those predominantly nonwhite 
neighborhoods, families were denied home loans and 
other vital resources through redlining practices. In the 
midcentury era of urban renewal, those areas underwent 
further upheaval through the city’s decision to demolish 
working class neighborhoods designated “slums.”


Evictions are on the public record, so it’s not uncom­
mon for landlords to hold a potential tenant’s history 
against them. A past eviction can be disastrous for low-in­
come tenants attempting to navigate the private housing 
market. And for someone living in public or subsidized 
housing, an eviction can permanently terminate their 
ability to benefit from government housing assistance.


Renee Dineen, a paralegal at LAA, says that landlords 
in New Haven often raise rents to the highest level that 
the Housing Choice Voucher Program (Section 8) or 
the Rental Assistance Program—both federally-subsi­
dized housing support for low-income families—will 
allow, which further disadvantages residents who don’t 
receive housing benefits.


As the eviction crisis in New Haven has grown, so too 
have the obstacles to fighting it. One of the most press­
ing problems is the lack of housing attorneys. Downsiz­
ing in Connecticut legal services and state budget cuts 
have severely restricted the pool of available lawyers. 
Most tenants enter housing court self-represented.


Since the nineteen-nineties, and likely earlier, the 
ratio of landlord-tenant legal representation has been 
roughly eighty to twenty, according to a 1995 Yale Law & 
Policy Review article by Steve Gunn. Today, on average, 
81 percent of landlords in New Haven eviction cases 
have legal representation, compared to 10 percent of 
tenants, according to Billy Huang, the LAA researcher, 
indicating a slight decrease in recent years.


Dineen says that LAA had a seventy-person staff in 
its heyday in the nineteen-seventies. It’s closer to thirty 
today. They used to take walk-in clients, she says, but 
now have to be far more selective about the cases they 
take on. Their housing unit team is just four people.


Many tenants do not even make their Housing Ses­
sion court date, resulting in eviction by default. Amy 
Eppler-Epstein, an attorney at LAA, says that educa-

tional and language barriers often prevent tenants from 
appearing in court. Some tenants also worry about jeop­
ardizing their employment or think that nothing can be 
done to fight the eviction.


But Connecticut does have a well-established sys­
tem for resolving housing cases: a housing mediation 
program designed to give the landlord and tenant an 
opportunity to reach an agreement without going to 
trial. During meetings ranging from ten minutes to an 
hour, mediation specialists resolve over 90 percent of 
cases, according to Alexandra Gillett, who has worked as 
a mediation specialist since 2012.


“Oftentimes, the situation that arose to bring you to 
housing court wasn’t catastrophic—it was temporary,” 
Gillett explains. “All we need to do is make a plan to 
help them manage the payments.” Sometimes, however, 
the best solution for both parties is a “graceful exit strat­
egy.” The rare case not resolved in mediation goes to 
trial, usually the same day.


Housing mediation specialists, legal aid attorneys and 
social service providers have seen the adverse effects 
of Connecticut’s budget crisis on their ability to help 
low-income renters. According to Erin Kemple, of the 
Connecticut Fair Housing Center, security deposit 
guarantee programs—which help low-income people 
find housing by giving landlords a guarantee of the first 
month’s rent—have been largely eliminated statewide. 
Gillett says she’s seen “a further limiting of already 
incredibly limited resources.” She adds that there used 
to be agencies to which she could refer tenants for 
back-rent assistance, or landlords for energy assistance. 
“Those programs have all but dried up, unfortunately,” 
she says.


COLLATERAL DAMAGE
Eviction strips a tenant of housing stability and jeop­
ardizes their ability to find a new home, but its effects 
can be much farther-reaching. The stress and logistical 
difficulties of experiencing an eviction can make it hard 
to hold down a job. And eviction can leave psychologi­
cal scars, often leading to increased rates of depression.


“When you get evicted you lose not only your home 
but your neighborhood and your school. You also lose 
your stuff, which is taken by movers or put on a side­
walk,” says Matthew Desmond, a professor of sociol­
ogy at Princeton University and author of the Pulitzer 
Prize–winning book Evicted. “Eviction comes with a 
mark which can prevent you from moving into a good 
neighborhood and decent housing because landlords 
turn you away.”


The Eviction Lab estimates that 2.3 million people 
were evicted in America in 2016, which, Desmond 
notes, is thirty-six times the number of people who died 
from opioid overdoses.  The scale of the problem is enor­
mous, he says—and it’s “absolutely underestimated” 
due to the lack of transparency and significant gaps in 
eviction record data from municipal governments.


“I think that when we add all that up, we are forced 
to the conclusion that eviction isn’t just a condition of 
poverty, it’s a cause of poverty,” Desmond says.


Last spring, Dr. Jack Tsai, an associate professor of 
psychology at Yale and staff psychologist at the Veterans 
Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System, was in the midst 
of running a nine-month observational study of tenants 
who appear in New Haven Housing Court for eviction 
cases. Every few months, he and his team checked in 
with about fifty participants to track their mental health. 
In his study, Dr. Tsai says, there were several instances 
in which participants reported suicidal thoughts. 


“Evictions are a lose-lose situation,” he says. “They’re 
stressful for the tenants, but they’re stressful for the 
landlords, too. And it’s a loss for society because people 
aren’t invested in their communities anymore.”


On average, New Haven landlords lose about $3,000 
during an eviction, a combination of the tenants’ unpaid 
rent, fees paid to the state marshal for eviction paper­

For Mezick, evictions are merely part of the 
job. He doesn’t usually ask tenants if they 
have another place lined up. “Everything’s 
going good, and I ask that question, and 
they’re triggered. My goal is to do this as

work, and moving costs, according to a 2007 Yale Law 
School student paper by Michael Gottesman.


At an eviction one cold April morning on Gorham 
Avenue in Hamden, the landlord, a petite woman, paces 
anxiously on the front lawn while movers load up her 
tenant’s U-Haul. State Marshal Mezick tells the land­
lord to leave while the movers work, careful to keep her 
and the tenant apart. 

As the tenant packs up her second-floor apartment, 
she complains that she was just two days late with her 
rent when the landlord began eviction proceedings. Her 
young son, the hood of his sweatshirt pulled up over his 
head, watches expressionlessly as his mother and older 
brother carry bags of possessions out of the apartment. 
The U-Haul is loaded up in forty-five minutes, and the 
evicted tenant, cigarette dangling from her mouth, asks 
one of the movers for a light.

“I made a mistake renting to her,” the landlord says 
bitterly as the tenant drives off. The tenant owes her 
almost $2,000 in unpaid rent, and she’s paying $460 for 
the eviction fees, she says. “She’s had evictions, and I 
paid the price.”

For Mezick, evictions are merely part of the job. He 
doesn’t usually ask tenants if they have another place 
lined up. “Everything’s going good, and I ask that ques­
tion, and they’re triggered. My goal is to do this as 

“I have on occasion served the execution and the kid 
comes to the door. I hate that,” he says. “If the kid comes 
to the door, I fold it in half and say, ‘Give this to your 
mother.’”


**Title: Holding On**

HOLDING ON
Grace Luysterborghs says that her unstable housing 
situation keeps her from living the life she most desires. 
She wants a bigger, cleaner apartment, with enough 
space for all her clothes, so she can stop wasting $200 
every month on storage fees. She wants to budget her 
money better, maybe save up for a car. She wants to be 
healthier, to eat better and exercise more. But most of 
all, she says, she wants peace of mind.

Her eviction was scheduled for 8:30 a.m. on April 
12. In the weeks leading up to that date, she tried to 
resolve the issue with her property manager at the Hous­
ing Authority, since she’d paid the outstanding rent, but 
to no avail.  She did not seek legal assistance until two 
days before her eviction, when she asked New Haven 
Legal Assistance for help filing paperwork for a tempo­
rary injunction.

On the injunction form, she marked an “x” next to 
a line stating, “The defendant has no other safe, ade­
quate, and affordable place to live, and/or cannot move 
before the date set for eviction.” She put “x”s down next 
to “The defendant suffers from a disability making it 
difficult to find replacement housing,” “The defendant 
lives in subsidized housing and may lose the subsidy if 
evicted,” and “The defendant in fact paid all rent, use 
and occupancy, and/or arrearage owed.” She attached 
photocopies of her rent receipts for January and Febru­
ary, in addition to the back pay she owed, and the full 
$202 rent for March and April.

That same day, a judge at Housing Court granted her 
a temporary injunction on the grounds that “irreparable 
harm would result to the defendant/tenant unless the 
requested relief is granted.” Her formal hearing was set 
for April 24.


**Title: Housing Session**

HOUSING SESSION
The morning of her court date, Luysterborghs wakes 
up at 7 a.m, in pain. She skips breakfast to soak in the 
bathtub, hoping to relieve her aching body. Her case­
worker picks her up and drives her the mile from her 
apartment to the New Haven County Court.

Just before 9:30 a.m., she climbs the white steps of the 
courthouse and passes between the towering columns 
into the light-filled atrium. She takes the elevator up 
to the third floor, Courtroom D: Housing Session. She 
finds a seat in the row of chairs facing the judge. Across 
from her is a box filled with attorneys and mediators. 
She’s nervous, but she prayed about her case the night 
before: “I got to give this situation to God.”

Luysterborghs’ friend Shirley Little, who lives in West 
Haven, arrives to provide emotional support. They settle 
in for a long wait. But after only ten minutes, a represen­
tative from the Housing Authority calls Luysterborghs 
over and brings her outside the courtroom. Attorneys 
and clients confer in the hallway, leaning against marble 
walls and leafing through documents. The representa­
tive explains that the Housing Authority recognizes its 
error; Grace is up to date on her rent. Luysterborghs will 
have to file a motion to open the judgment again, which 
will allow the Housing Authority to withdraw their case 
against her.

Leaving the courthouse, Luysterborghs is excited, but 
worried about getting the rest of the paperwork filled 
out. She and Little decide to take the bus to Hamden 
and have lunch at St. Ann’s Soup Kitchen, two and a 
half miles down Dixwell Avenue.
In the basement of the church, Luysterborghs and

aid is part of the solution. And, for systemic change, 
Desmond has championed a universal housing voucher 
program, which would dramatically expand low-income 
people’s access to housing.

“Change is hard, and big change is even harder,” Des­
mond reflects. “But I do think that a lot of cities and a lot 
of folks in Washington are waking up to the fact that you 
can’t fix poverty without fixing housing.”


At the soup kitchen, Little motions to the dozen peo­
ple eating at nearby tables. “If she didn’t show up [in 
court], she would have been homeless. That’s why a lot 
of people are homeless, a lot of people sitting here.”


Little, who is fifty-six and has a Section 8 voucher, 
wants to buy a house by the time she’s sixty-five, but 
it won’t be in New Haven. It will be in North Caro­
lina, where she has some family, close to her children 
in Georgia. “The South is beautiful,” she says with a 
smile. “All my illnesses will go away. I know the country 
air makes me well. I just need to get back to it. I’m done 
here.”


After lunch, Luysterborghs and Little board a city 
bus that takes them back downtown. Luysterborghs sits 
at a window seat, Little one row behind, which is how 
they like it. Luysterborghs is friends with the driver, and 
greets nearly everyone who boards the bus by name. 
Little points out the street where she grew up. Luyster­
borghs waves at her church as they pass by.


The bus accelerates down Dixwell Avenue, past cor­
ner delis, storefront churches, and blocks upon blocks 
of clapboard houses, some with bare lawns, some with 
flowers out front. Luysterborghs smiles at each passen­
ger who passes, grateful for this warm afternoon and this 
bus that will deliver her home.
– Eliza Fawcett is a senior in 
Jonathan Edwards College.

Little listen to a volunteer say a blessing before lining 
up for lunch. Today, it’s kielbasa, roast vegetables, and 
mashed potatoes.


Luysterborghs puts her tray down at an empty table, 
takes a picture of her meal on her phone, and says a 
quick prayer. Her hair is pulled back. She looks at ease, 
buoyant after the morning’s events.

“The potatoes are banging!” she exclaims to Little.


She double-checks that the Motion to Open is still 
in her handbag. She’s going to file it as soon as she can, 
hoping the whole situation will be put to rest in a few 
days.

“The legal system sucks,” Little says. “Why can’t they 
just say, ‘We made an error?’”

“Yeah,” Luysterborghs says, “the woman from Hous­
ing Authority said, ‘Yes, Grace, you’re up to date,’ and 
everything.”

“That one little paper caused all those problems,” Lit­
tle says, shaking her head.


Luysterborghs’ younger son, who just got out of rehab, 
lives in New Haven. Her eldest is also in the city, but she 
hasn’t seen him in a while. She didn’t tell them about 
the eviction proceedings, and doesn’t want to. They 
have their own problems, she says. “I just deal with it 
on my own.”


It was a traumatic process just to keep an apartment 
that often feels like it’s closing in on her. “I really don’t 
want to live at Union Avenue, but right now, it’s conve­
nient, right by the train station,” she says. Her rent will 
be $202 going forward. She wishes it was a little less, 
maybe $150. But she will have to make do. 


And of course, Luysterborghs is one of the lucky ones. 
For many renters in New Haven, a Notice to Quit Posses­
sion ends in eviction, and sometimes homelessness. As 
Luysterborghs and Little eat lunch at the soup kitchen, 
that reality seems to hover around them.


Luysterborghs nearly lost her home and hard-won 
stability to the complex, often unforgiving forces of the 
New Haven Housing Authority, the court system and 
city bureaucracy.  To her, the vast legal structure sur­
rounding evictions seemed inescapable, all-consuming, 
and she was fortunate to escape unscathed. Although 
her court appearance ended favorably, four other ten­
ants were likely put out on the street that same day. 


Desmond, for one, is optimistic that solutions to 
America’s eviction crisis exist. That’s partly because the 
housing crisis has grown so severe that it has begun to 
spread without precedent to other sectors of the econ­
omy, dragging large swaths of the population into its 
destructive wake. The problem is too big to ignore, he 
says.


There’s no right to counsel in housing court, although 
studies have shown that tenants who have access to a 
lawyer are far less likely to be evicted. Expanding legal

Cash bail keeps low income people locked up. In New Haven and Hew York, two organizations are 
fighting against it, with different consequences for their communities. Reporting for this piece was 
supported by the Ed Bennett III Memorial Fund.


<br>

T
he first thing one notices when walking 
up to the entrance of the Vernon C. Bain Cen­
ter (VBC) in New York City is the fetid smell coming 
from the Fulton Fish Market next door. The road 
leading up to VBC has no sidewalks—just barbed 
wire fences. Queens shimmers across the East River.
Some of the inmates at VBC—known as The Boat, 
since it’s anchored six feet from shore—are serv­
ing short-term sentences, from thirty days to a few 
months, for low-level misdemeanors. The vast major­
ity of its 800 male inmates, however, have landed 
there because they have yet to pay their bail. One of 
these men is a young relative of Jermaine Davis.
A stout, middle-aged Bronx resident, Davis looks 
both exhausted and relieved, like he’s just finished 
a long hike. He has been crisscrossing the city try­
ing to post bail for his relative. “We’ve been back 
and forth for a few days, trying to get him out,” he 
tells me. Davis has been derailed again and again 
by bureaucratic hurdles. First, the Bronx County 
Hall of Justice turned him away because he didn’t 
have a state-issued ID or a pay stub. By the time he 
returned, his family member had already been trans­
ferred to The Boat; Davis was told he could only pay 
there. When I met him at VBC’s bail window, his 
relative had been in jail for four days.
In the United States, people charged with crimes 
are often held in pretrial detention unless they can 
post bail, which is set by a judge. In theory, bail is 
an incentive to appear in court. The fee is returned 
when the trial is concluded, and forfeited if the per­
son charged doesn’t show up. But your experience 
with bail largely depends on whether you’re rich or 
poor. 
When film mogul Harvey Weinstein appeared in 
court this spring to face charges of rape and criminal 
sex acts, he paid his $1 million bail with a cashier’s 
check, and was out of the courtroom within ten min­
utes. In 2010, when sixteen-year-old Kalief Browder 
was charged with stealing a backpack in the Bronx, 
he couldn’t post his $3,000 bail and spent the next 
three years in jail before his charges were dismissed. 
Two years later, he committed suicide.
Bail keeps 450,000 Americans locked up every day 
simply because they’re too poor to pay. Even when 
bail is set as low as $250, it’s often enough to entan­
gle low-income people in the criminal justice system 
for months or years. Cash bail is particularly insidi­
ous. Some forms of bail allow defendants to pay only 
a portion of the total, put up valuable possessions as 
collateral, or cut a deal with a bail bondsman to front 
the bond for them. This is not the case with cash 
bail. When a judge sets cash bail, the defendant must 
pay the full amount out of pocket to be set free. In 
courtrooms across America, cash bail is frequently 
set for minor misdemeanor crimes and even traffic 
violations. Typically, prosecutors push for cash bail, 
the defense pushes against it, and it’s up to the judge 
to decide. Each time cash bail is set too high for the 
accused to pay, someone who is still innocent in the 
eyes of the law is placed in jail.
Even a brief stint behind bars causes significant 
collateral damage. People like Davis’ relative lose 
access to family and employment, and often expe­
rience emotional and physical trauma. “The whole 
process is insane,” Davis said. “It creates a huge 
strain on the family.”
Being Black or Latino increases the odds of being 
one of those 450,000 people. According to the Pre­
trial Justice Institute, courts saddle Black men with 
thirty-five percent higher bail amounts than white 
counterparts charged with the same crime and with 
similar criminal histories. For Hispanic men, that fig­
ure is nineteen percent. 
And serving time in jail pretrial drastically 
increases a person’s conviction rate. It makes it three 
to four times more likely that one will serve a prison 
or jail sentence after trial, and such sentences are, on 
average, two to three times longer, according to the 
Pretrial Justice Institute. Often, defendants choose to 
take a guilty plea; they are able to leave jail that day 
but are forced to carry a criminal record for the rest 
of their lives, making it considerably more challeng­
ing to get a job or earn a degree.
Jermaine Davis’ close-knit family can pick up 
the slack when one of them is incarcerated. And he 
has a job, at an employment training and addiction 
recovery center, which allows him to take time off to 
resolve his relative’s case. Most importantly, he has 
the money to do so. Most of the 450,000 don’t have 
people like Davis on their side.
In recent years, the cash bail epidemic has trig­
gered a national movement. Nonprofit bail funds, 
financed almost entirely by private donations, have 
opened up from Tulsa to St. Louis, and Detroit to 
New York, posting bail for those who can’t afford it 
themselves. Their clients include people like Davis’ 
relative, awaiting freedom in the belly of the Boat. 
Two years ago, New Haven joined the map with the 
Connecticut Bail Fund—an organization taking a 
radical, intimate approach to bail reform.
During the summer of 2017, I worked at the Bronx 
Freedom Fund, a non-profit bail fund serving the 
South Bronx. The team at BFF also founded The 
Bail Project, an umbrella organization that plans to 
open 40 bail funds across the nation and bail out 
over 160,000 people by 2022. This summer, I trav­
eled back to the Freedom Fund to understand the 
genesis of this national movement, and then to Con­
necticut Bail Fund’s offices in New Haven, where, 
I soon learned, organizers are viewing bail in an 
entirely new light, with very different stakes for the 
community.
The Freedom Fund’s office, a collection of cubi­
cles on the sixth floor of the Bronx County Hall of 
Justice, sports a panoramic view of the South Bronx 
through floor-to-ceiling windows. The organization’s 
vision is equally expansive: It’s trying to liberate the 
borough.
When the organization began in 2016, it had a 
single employee quietly operating in a corner of the 
office of the Bronx Defenders, just down the street 
from the Hall. With the Defenders’ fundraising con­
nections and large community of legal advocates 
to support them, the Freedom Fund has rapidly 
expanded in the last two years. They’ve hired nine 
more employees, opened a branch in Queens, and 
posted bail for 2,020 Bronx residents. 
 Donations to the BFF are pouring in. When I last 
visited, their director was giving a tour to the niece of a 
donor who’d just written a $100 thousand check. They 
now can take on almost every client who qualifies. 
Outside the offices of the Freedom Fund, the mar­
ble hallways of the Hall of Justice echo with the anx­
ious murmurs of those whose day in court has come. 
Lawyers confer with clients in hushed corners; defen­
dants fidget, waiting to be called; through the heavy 
doors, a judge presides over a cherry-paneled court­
room.
 Each day, the organization receives several referrals 
from public defenders representing clients who can’t 
afford bail. Usually, a referral comes after a client has 
been arraigned, but before they are transferred to jail. 
When a client is approved for payment, a Freedom

Fund employee goes down to their holding cell and 
offers to post bail. Most clients assume the BFF 
expects a refund. But in reality, they’ll never have to 
pay the money back.


For all the legal entanglements and cross-city 
scrambles that precede it, the act of setting someone 
free is anticlimactic: the person posting bail presents 
a cashier’s check to a clerical worker behind a glass 
window. Paying for someone’s freedom looks more 
like a trip to the DMV than a singular act of justice.


A few days later, at the initial court date, employ­
ees of the Freedom Fund wade through the hallway 
commotion. One by one, they read out the names of 
their clients for the day, calling them loudly in the 
hallways and shout-whispering them in courtrooms. 
Each client receives a version of the same speech: an 
introduction to the employee, the organization, and 
a reminder that the only thing the Freedom Fund 
needs is their continued attendance at court. Every 
meeting between a Freedom Fund representative 
and a client in pretrial detention ends with a sim­
ple question: “Do you need our help with anything 
outside of bail?” Some clients are in search of a job, 
some need help finding housing, some are looking 
for affordable health care, and some just need a pre-
paid phone. These people are pointed towards a cli­
ent advocate like Yonah Zeitz, a full-time case man­
ager and bail payer.


The fund’s client advocacy branch exists because 
paying someone’s bail doesn’t solve all their prob­
lems. “If they’re not able to get stability once they’re 
out,” Zeitz asks, “then what’s the point of paying 
their bail?” In the immediate aftermath of pretrial 
detention, clients typically need help with material 
needs: finding a job, a place to live, or someone to 
look after their kids. The Fund tries to connect them 
to the resources they need to get back on their feet 
post-detention.


Through The Bail Project, the Freedom Fund is 
expanding its model to other cities where cash bail is 
a pervasive problem. But New Haven’s bail fund isn’t 
part of this growing network; it stands alone. The 
organization demonstrates a radical approach that 
could fundamentally change how people in New 
Haven fight for justice.


The Connecticut Bail Fund (CBF) occupies a 
single, street-level room on Grand Avenue in Fair 
Haven. The space inside is as modest as the unassum­
ing brick façade. A small waiting area, with wooden 
floors and simple chairs, takes up most of the room; 
the desks of its two employees are shoved towards the 
back. Compared to the Hall of Justice, it feels much 
more inviting.


On Wednesday nights, CBF’s office hosts a sup­
port group for people the organization has bailed out 
and their loved ones. The visitors pile into the mod­
est space, hoping either to strategize about their legal 
cases or simply vent about their troubles. They share 
stories of aggressive correctional officers, insensitive 
lawyers, and bullheaded judges.


This past April, Sharon* was arrested for assault 
and disorderly conduct (she wished to remain anon­
ymous; Sharon is a pseudonym). She couldn’t afford 
her $2,500 bail. After a week in jail, she received 
a visit from Ana María Rivera-Forastieri, the co-di­
rector of CBF. Rivera-Forastieri explained that the 
bail fund was an organization dedicated to helping 
people like Sharon, and told her that if she accepted 
their offer to pay bail on her behalf, she would be 
free the next day. She eagerly accepted.


Sharon feels she has been given a precious oppor­
tunity—one that she doesn’t want to waste. “I’m in 
women’s wellness, relapse prevention, anger man­
agement, those types of things, so that my time out­
side of jail is actually being put to use,” she said. 
Programs like these are often mandated by a judge. 
Sharon attends each of them voluntarily.


Sharon is part of CBF’s support group. Giving 
support at these meetings means as much to her as 
receiving it. “I think that it’s also important for a lot 
of these people getting out of jail to see that there’s 
someone who’s been formerly homeless, and who’s 
been in a lot of those crappy conditions, and is still 
fighting a case, and can still find a way to stay sober,” 
she said. “I just want to encourage others that it is 
possible.”


CBF has bailed out 140 people since its found­
ing in 2017. Their organization is smaller than the 
Bronx Freedom Fund, and eschews The Bail Proj­
ect’s sweeping approach. That’s intentional: CBF’s 
work hinges on intimate, prolonged collaboration 
with formerly incarcerated New Haveners, whether 
through support groups, rallies, or a performing arts 
group that started meeting biweekly this summer. 
“They’ve been learning about how to use the story 
of self,” Rivera-Forastieri said. “At every meeting,

they talk about what they’ve experienced in the com­
munity, living on the streets or having lived on the 
streets.”


After bail is posted, the organization pushes to 
provide its smaller, tight-knit group of clients with 
opportunities for activist engagement and self-expres­
sion, placing them at the forefront of their commu­
nity. The strength of the Freedom Fund lies in its 
individual case management, in connecting individ­
ual clients with the material resources they are seek­
ing as they exit the criminal justice system. CBF’s 
strength, in contrast, lies in the comfort that Sharon 
finds in attending the CBF’s weekly meetings—a 
comfort that is rooted in the emotional support fos­
tered by a close-knit community.


The different approaches of CBF and BFF mean 
that the two organizations have necessarily diverging 
end goals. BFF and The Bail focus on quantity. “Our 
mission, first and foremost, is we want to bail out 
as many people as humanly possible,” said Camilo 
Ramirez, The Bail Project’s communications direc­
tor. “And we want to do that because the human 
cost of waiting is too great.” They want to galvanize 
a national movement, rather than focusing solely on 
a single community.


To their staff, the practice of cash bail causes the 
systematic destruction of communities, and decon­
structing it presents the swiftest path to empower­
ment. “Community building cannot occur at all 
while community members are incarcerated,” said 
Alex Anthony, former director of BFF’s Queens 
Branch.


As a result, a key part of The Bail Project’s work 
involves legislative reform. “We feel very optimistic 
that bail reform is the one battle that we might win 
in the criminal justice system,” Ramirez said. Since 
2012, almost every state legislature has addressed 
pretrial injustice. Illinois now requires a rehearing 
within seven days for anyone held on cash bail, and 
judges in New Jersey are required to employ a risk 
assessment tool to discern whether or not a defen­
dant should be released pretrial. The Bail Project 
is working to back more legislation like this with an 
even more radical end goal: to end cash bail.


Connecticut, too, has enacted bold reform. Legis­
lation passed last year made it illegal for judges to set 
bail on misdemeanor cases unless the defendant has 
a long history of missing court dates. That same bill 
prohibited judges from setting cash-only bail, mean­
ing people in New Haven will never have to pay the 
entire bail amount up front, out of pocket: they can 
either pay a portion of their bail amount (usually 
around ten percent), or enlist a bail bondsman to 
help them pay. As Senator Bob Godfrey explained on 
the floor of the State Assembly, “If you’re a million­
aire, [a $2,000 bail] is half a day’s pay, and if you’re 
making minimum wage, is 25 days’ pay. I don’t think 
that’s justice for anyone, let alone for all.”


Just over 3,300 people in Connecticut were in pre­
trial detention as of December 2016, according to a 
2017 study by the Connecticut Sentencing Commis­
sion. In New York City, meanwhile, an average of 
7,100 people were held in pretrial detention on any 
given day in 2017, according to data released by the 
city’s Department of Corrections this March. Last 
year’s changes could propel Connecticut forward.


Even though the recent reforms may help their 
clients, CBF doesn’t focus on lobbying. According 
to Rivera-Forastieri, when the voices of formerly 
incarcerated people aren’t prioritized, “bullsh*t 
reform gets passed in the legislature that has little 
to no effect on the ground. Our objective is to build 
power in communities. If that’s what people want, 
they should be leading that conversation.”


For example, CBF’s clients haven’t shown a strong 
interest in pushing for the total elimination of bail, 
so the organization hasn’t thrown its weight behind 
that kind of proposal. “To try to organize people 
around bail abolition, specifically, I think would feel 
coercive and not really meeting people where they’re 
at,” co-founder Brett Davidson explained.


This mantra—meeting people where they’re at—
traces back to CBF’s founding. All four of CBF’s 
founders were Yale students. When they received 
the seed money from Yale necessary to jumpstart the 
organization, their first order of business was con­
ducting listening sessions throughout New Haven. 
They wanted to hear from formerly incarcerated 
people about their ideal bail fund, an approach that 
would guide their game plan. To ensure the orga­
nization would be truly led by New Haveners, they 
hired Rivera-Forastieri, a bilingual community orga­
nizer with a law degree who had worked with Junta 
for Progressive Action, a local nonprofit that advo­
cates for New Haven’s Latinx community.


In sharp contrast to The Bail Project, CBF isn’t fix­

ated on bailing out as many people as possible. The 
way to effectively serve New Haven, according to the 
Connecticut Bail Fund, is to give its clients a sense 
of ownership over the organization. “We could be 
bailing out many more people a week if that was our 
sole focus, but that’s not our sole focus,” said Rive­
ra-Forastieri. “Organizing and building power is our 
number one focus.”


To CBF, a bailout is a crucial transition point at 
which the organization can help start a process of 
transformation, placing criminalized people in con­
trol. “We form relationships with people in crisis 
moments and build trust that way,” explains David­
son. Those relationships allow their clients to lever­
age CBF’s resources towards social justice causes 
across the board. In 2017, the CBF mobilized local 
activists to protest the lack of housing resources in 
New Haven; this past July, they helped organize a 
rally to abolish ICE. Later that month, CBF helped 
bring together an event that exemplified its philoso­
phy.


Tiheba Bain has never applied for a job online. 
Classified ads were still the norm when she entered 
federal prison in 1997. When she was released in 
2007, she remembered, “I came home with the 
clothes on my back and maybe one hundred dollars 
in my pocket. Maybe.” But she also had a head full 
of ideas of how the criminal justice system needed to 
change—especially for women. For four years, Bain 
commuted from Bridgeport to Manhattan in order 
to work and receive her degree in Psychology and 
Women in Criminal Justice from the City University 
of New York.


This summer, Bain organized an event with the 
support of a sprawling network of community organi­
zations and nonprofits, including a local immigrants’ 
rights organization, Unidad Latina en Acción (ULA); 
Planned Parenthood of Southeast New England; and 
the National Council for Incarcerated and Formerly 
Incarcerated Women and Girls. The CBF gave her 
a space (First and Summerfield United Methodist 
Church on the New Haven Green), secured funding, 
and connected her with community members inter­
ested in attending the town hall. In mid-July, thirty 
community members gathered with representatives 
from these groups to discuss Bain’s biggest ambition: 
“‘How can we end mass incarceration for women and 
girls? How do we get there?’”


While The Bail Project wants to mobilize commu­
nities across the country in order to eliminate cash 
bail, the Connecticut Bail Fund wants to pay bail in 
order to mobilize the community. The cash bail sys­
tem keeps low-income people locked up until trial, 
often for months or years. Through CBF’s model, 
people like Sharon and Tiheba Bain are taking 
charge.


Supporting those community members matters 
more to Davidson and Rivera-Forastieri than the 
number of people they bail out. “We want to focus 
our resources on building up a lot of leaders in our 
community who can develop the work that we do 
and who can speak about their experiences,” David­
son said. “That’s the main vision for the future: to 
create a sustained community organizing force.”

ost first-years walk into their dorms knowing little 
more about their suitemates than their names, who’s 
bringing the microwave, and the Facebook likes from middle 
school that still haunt each person’s profile. (A highlight from 
my freshman suite: “Bring back the word ‘wizard’ as an adjec­
tive.”) 

The residential college deans are the ones who do the heavy 
lifting for roommate selection, with the aid of that (very) cursory 
survey the prefrosh fill out. All I remember from that survey 
is marking “no country, no metal” under “what music would 
bother me,” only to wake up on the second day of college with 
Kenny Chesney’s crooning wafting up into the top bunk. At 
least it wasn’t Megadeth. 

Sometimes it seems like the residential college deans 
approach putting together suites like piecing together a compli­
cated jigsaw puzzle, and sometimes it’s like they’re playing Dr. 
Frankenstein. Either way, they do have students’ best interests at 
heart. It’s just hard to see how people will react to living in close 
quarters, the same way it’s hard to predict what your roommate 
will do if you tell them they need new, better deodorant. 

Margaret Clark, head of Trumbull College, makes it clear 
that she doesn’t use Trumbull students in her study of close 
relationships at the Yale Psychology department, but she can 
tell you some things about what makes relationships succeed. 
(She focuses less on what makes relationships fail—for more on 
that, consult the monograph I’m coauthoring with my former 
suitemates: The Case of the Missing Oreo-Cheesecake Bars: A 
Model of Interpersonal Discord vis-à-vis the Macronutrients of 
a Scarce Resource (Goode, Zevallos, Vernick, and Macey, In 
Press). 

In her previous position at Carnegie Mellon University, 
Clark worked on a study of the university’s randomly paired 
freshmen, analyzing the factors that made for a happy dorm. 
“What we found,” Clark said, “was that people with different 
academic interests were much more likely to stick with each 
other the next year.” It turns out that an engineer and an actor 
won’t compare themselves to each other as much as the suite of 
kids in Directed Studies who’ll worry all year about who under­
stands Hegel the best. (Spoiler: none of them.)

In another study, punderfully titled “The Positives of Nega­
tive Emotions,” Clark and others looked at incoming students’ 
willingness to express fear, anxiety, and sadness before arriving 
at college. At the end of the year, the researchers used a ques­
tionnaire to determine how many friends each participant had 
made. Students who were more willing to express their negative 
emotions made more friends. As Clark explained, you can’t be 
supportive if your suitemate never tells you that something is 
wrong.

Because of the complete lack of pressure to put up a façade of 
success and well being at Yale, I am sure no student here could 
learn from this study, and we can move along.


Trouble getting along with your roommate? It’s all in your head.

My own residential college dean explained to my freshman 
suite that we’d been placed together because three out of our 
four had mentioned something vaguely outdoorsy in the incom­
ing survey. Our pursuits—backpacking, flyfishing, and bee­
keeping—actually have little in common, but they do literally 
take place out-of-doors, so points there. (You might be wonder­
ing about how our fourth suitemate came to be grouped with us; 
we are too.) Clark confirmed that, in theory, my suite had been 
well-matched since having a similar interest in outdoor activi­
ties gave us something to do together without much room for 
unhealthy comparison. We never once did anything outdoors 
together, though, and our only regular group activity was tearing 
apart the suite looking for  ID when he lost it. But that’s also 
an activity without much room for unhealthy comparison, so it 
worked out.

Ultimately, there is only one year of semi-random pairing at 
Yale. Upperclassman housing affords you more choice, so the 
odds of living with someone who drunkenly wets the bed and 
sleeps on a bare mattress rather than laundering the sheets are 
much lower. As are the odds of your roommate taking a bottle 
of Febreze Hawaiian Aloha to your guest’s eyes with intent to 
blind. They probably won’t pee in jars, or put every item you 
own in condoms while you’re visiting home one weekend (all 
documented suitemate behavior). A lot of the reduction in 
roommate craziness happens because you’ll have the chance to 
cohabitate with someone a bit more compatible. As Clark puts 
it, “similarity cuts both ways.” Difference decreases comparison, 
but too much difference can make for interpersonal discord.

I asked Clark what her advice to incoming first-years would 
be. She said they shouldn’t compare themselves to their suitem­
ates, or to anyone else, for that matter. And if you want to know 
why your roommate is up into the wee hours doing jumping 
jacks in the common room, or what they think of the merits of 
“wizard” as an adjective, or whether you can have one of the 
Oreo-cheesecake bars stacked bottom to top in the fridge, or 
how on earth they could enjoy Kenny Chesney—just ask them.
