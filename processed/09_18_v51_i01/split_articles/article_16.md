I.     THE EAST END
When he first heard about the casino, Dr. Charlie Stallworth, a Connecticut state representative and the pastor of 
East End Baptist Tabernacle Church in 
Bridgeport, was skeptical. He didn’t think 
the developer, MGM Resorts International, was serious 
about the project, and he didn’t like the advertising campaign they were running. “Maybe I’m not the brightest guy 
in the room,” he remembers thinking, “but don’t try and 
manipulate me.” So, last September, when Stallworth heard 
about a press conference and groundbreaking ceremony in 
a vacant lot on the waterfront, he stayed away: “How are you 
going to have a groundbreaking for something that’s illegal 
to build?”

A few construction workers wore hard hats for the cameras, but the event that morning wasn’t really a groundbreaking. There were no shovels. Instead, standing in a tent 
beside artists’ depictions of a glitzy complex with yachts 
parked out front, Jim Murren, MGM’s president and CEO 
and a Bridgeport native, said construction could start on a 
$675-million resort and casino as soon as the state passed a 
bill to make it legal. “The idea of being able to bring thousands of jobs, hundreds of millions of dollars in investment, 
to a city where I was born that needs this so desperately is 
very rewarding for me,” he said.

The site MGM had chosen was in the East End neighborhood, three blocks from Stallworth’s church: a patch of 
concrete on an old industrial channel in Bridgeport Harbor. 
This spot was now the center of a battle over where—and 
whether—Connecticut would open its first casino off a Native American reservation. MGM was already on track to 
spend more than $4.7 million on lobbying and associated 
costs within 18 months. Only recently, the gambling titan 
had sued Connecticut, attempting to block a similar proposal from the state’s two federally recognized Native American tribes, the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation and the 
Mohegan Tribe (both of which already operate casinos on 
their reservations). Now, it was launching a charm offensive: 
community meetings, union rallies, donations to nonprofits 
and scholarship funds, talks at Rotary clubs, web and TV ad­
vertising, and glossy brochures mailed to homes in Bridgeport and New Haven. “Support 7,000 total jobs,” one brochure said, “at no cost to taxpayers.” The state’s two largest 
cities were each promised something. Bridgeport would get 
$8 million a year for hosting the casino, MGM promised. 
New Haven would get a jobs-training center. And Connecticut would get $50 million up front in licensing fees before 
the first card was dealt.

Back in September, Stallworth had his doubts about the 
casino. But he knew his city was struggling. “Bridgeport has 
been stereotyped as that place where bad things happen,” 
he said. “We have to change that.” Once a proud producer 
of everything from sewing machines and luxury cars to bayonets and rifles, Bridgeport flourished during World War II 
but began losing jobs and residents soon after.

Deindustrialization in the ‘70s and ‘80s hit the city hard. 
Crack, crime, and suburban flight made things worse. By 
1990, Bridgeport’s murder rate was the highest in New England. Its budget was deep in the red. According to Stallworth, Bridgeport still hasn’t fully recovered. “Just to ride 
through the neighborhood, you see trash, you see sidewalks 
broken,” he said. “If I were sixteen, I don’t know if that 
would motivate me to try to push forward in my life.”

Stallworth met with MGM executives at his church early 
this year to hear their pitch. The jobs and revenue projections they quoted got his attention. “Bridgeport has not had 
an economic boost, or a jobs boost, since who knows when,” 
he said. And he appreciated that their plans included some 
family-friendly entertainment options, like a theater and 
a boardwalk mall. By spring, he concluded that MGM 
Bridgeport was the city’s best chance for a rebound.

Reverend Christopher Leighton thought differently. 
Leighton, the priest at St. Mark’s, an Episcopal church 
about two blocks from Dr. Stallworth’s church, opposed 
the casino from the start. His grandfather, a well-to-do accountant, lost everything to illicit gambling and left his son, 
Leighton’s father, in crushing debt. Leighton’s father took 
out his bitterness on his children. “I remember being beaten 
by my father for nothing,” the priest told me. “It’s a drama 
I wish I never had to go through.” A grandfather himself 
now, Leighton helps run a summer bible school for East 
End kids. “I don’t want to see the kids we’re trying to help 
get sucked into a life that could destroy them,” he said.

Stallworth’s support for the casino, Leighton said, probably stems from his thinking as an elected official, pursuing 
Bridgeport’s economic interests rather than following his 
heart as a preacher. “I’ve heard people say, who are in support of the casino, ‘We need the money,’” Leighton said. “But 
what are you going to do with that money? You can’t buy 
back your soul.”
