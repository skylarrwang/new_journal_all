EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
On a layover in El Salvador, I noticed the 
staring. I kept locking eyes with strangers—
the old man by the window, a woman digging 
through her purse, the child coming out of the 
bathroom. I felt flattered until I heard, “¿Quién es 
la china?”

China: a small porcelain doll on display for the 
world to see, fragile, foreign, china. 


I grew up reading the Western classics in 
Korean. They came in full-shelf packages: Les 
Miserablés, Little Women, King Lear, translated 
to satiate a child’s growing mind.

When the words were finally read to me in their 
original form, I cried because I did not know how 
to pronounce Gloucester.


They say the term gook originated from 
mi-guk, the Korean word for America. My people 
shouted mi-guk! at the pale-faced, jeep-roaring, 
gum-chewing liberators, pointed and hollered 
mi-guk! the way our white saviors have come to 
shout gook.

Gook: flat-faced, stub-nosed, slit-eyed, yel­
low-skinned American.


A reddit thread that reads: “I am only 
interested in the best: Asian women. Why is 
that? Could it be their fine skin and long silky 
hair? Could it be that unlike white women, they 
remember what it’s like to be a woman: to be doc­
ile and submissive and respectful to a man? Could 
it be their delicate, playful personalities? I believe 
it is all of the above.” 


A boy once recited Keats to me, as if he 
spoke the language of his forefathers: “bright 
star, would I were steadfast as thou art.” I remem­
ber wishing that they were my forefathers, that 
my bosom would rise and fall as a fair maiden’s 
breasts, that they had planted in me the same 
words so true and benign.

I lay naked in the provocation of our bod­
ies hooked into a shadow, his soft brunette hair 
against the tan of my skin, and I let him speak to 
feel the Romance of what it means to be white. 


I was there for the revival of Miss Saigon. 
Under the bright lights of a fictitious Saigon, the 
carnage of a 1975 bar scene unfolded before my 
eyes. I dwelled on the deranged romanticism of 
living through the ‘Nam, the unapologetic vulgar­
ity of scantily-clad, stick-skinny women prancing 
around with topless G.I.s. 

I wonder what it feels like to be thrown around. 
To be humped, cheaply bent over, to offer my 
every move to a man. 


I was sitting in the passenger seat of a red 
Toyota Corolla, facing a boy whose arms were 
intertwined with mine. It was well past curfew 
but making out in empty parking lots is a favorite 
American pastime. 

He flashed me a smile in the way that well-mean­
ing boys do before muttering, “I love when you do 
your hair like that. It just looks so—I don’t know. 
Elegant? Like a geisha or something. I like it.” 


“Do you have a boyfriend?” My mom 
asked one day.

“No, not really.” A white lie.

“That’s okay. Just don’t bring home a boy with 
blue eyes.”


During World War II, the Japanese 
snatched young girls from their homes in Korea 
and shipped them off in boatloads to barracks 
across the Pacific. Comfort women, we call them. 
They lay, teeth clenched, under the weight of the 
blood red sun as it rose and fell within them. 


Comfort (n.): “a state of physical ease and 
freedom from pain or constraint.” A state of physi­
cal intimacy awarded for bravery in battle. A state 
of constraint by the imperial army.

Rape. 


In Miss Saigon’s Dreamland sequence, 
one of the “girls,” Gigi, resists the advances of an 
American G.I. While he is impatient to undress 
her, she desperately tries to convince him to take 
her to America. He replies, “Oh, come on. Not 
tonight!” To which she pleads, “But I’ll make a 
good wife!” 

The bar owner walks over, slaps Gigi, and 
throws her to the ground. To ease the sudden rise 
in tension accompanied by a musical halt, he says: 
“It’s alright, gentlemen. It’s just Gigi. You know 
she likes it rough.”


The Japanese men who loved geishas colo­
nized women who look like me—their lords once 
ruled my mother tongue and land. They ripped 
the sangtu off the heads of my fathers, exposing 
scalp, snipping away a reverence for our ancestors 
as they tossed hair-knots to the ground. 


I wonder if Gigi really does like it rough. 
Did Vietnam like it rough when American sol­
diers fell from the sky? 


I like being choked in bed. I like the feel­
ing of fingers around my throat, of careful asphyx­
iation, of having the breath crushed out of me – I 
giggle.


I keep thinking maybe I like it rough the 
way Gigi likes it rough, and perhaps the real tro­
phy of war is this doubt they’ve managed to cast.
