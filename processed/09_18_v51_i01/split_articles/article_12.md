WHO’S LAUGHING NOW?
S N A P S H O T
Women are at the center of a revolution in Yale’s comedy scene.

F
ive women strut onto a makeshift stage with a 
smug swagger. The audience that fills the audito­
rium in Yale’s Linsly-Chittenden Hall is already laughing. 
With their baseball caps tilted sideways on their heads—and 
scratching their nether regions—the performers lumber to a 
line of chairs.
“Do we really think it’s a good idea to be taking ‘men’ 
out of ‘comedy’?” asks Ned, played by Raffi Donatich, in an 
aggressively deep voice.
“Then it would just be ‘Cody’,” Fred, played by Sarah 
Al-Shalash, replies, screwing up her brow, so slack-jawed 
she’s almost drooling. The other characters nod vigorously.
Then, from Luke, Emma Chanen’s character: “Your 
mum’s a chode!”
Donatich and Chanen pantomime a ‘snip’, scissor-bang­
ing their fingers in celebration of their joke.
So began the ‘cold open’ of Disast-Her, an April 13 sketch, 
stand-up, and improv showcase featuring 20 women from 
Yale’s comedy scene. The opener imagined a group of Yale’s 
male comedians devising a rival showcase. The sketch skew­
ered bad dick jokes, misguided allyship (hoisting a woman 
up on your shoulders does not “elevate her voice,” guys) and 
problematic icons (Daniel Tosh, anyone?). But eviscerating 
the patriarchy wasn’t the night’s only aim. Other improv 
scenes invited the viewers to  worlds strewn with dead cows 
and broken treehouses; stand-up comedians told tales of 
study abroad misadventures and medical mishaps.

Two months prior, a newly-formed stand-up collective for 
women and non-binary comedians hosted its first event, The 
Coven Presents: We Just Said That. Jokes ranged from the 
cure for catcalling to being called out at the Colbert Report. 
This event, too, was a smashing success: stage managers had 
to turn away a long line of would-be audience members at 
the door of the Jonathan Edwards Theater.

Yale has a grand total of six sketch groups, five improv 
groups, two stand-up troupes (including The Coven) and a 
plethora of regular stand-up open mics. With the notable 
exception of shows by the Sphincter Troupe, a non-male 
sketch comedy group founded in 2001, rarely does a comedy 
line-up at Yale feature zero dudes. To The Coven’s founder, 
Chloe Prendergast, the two new non-male comedy line-ups 
that cropped up in a semester emerged from a new consensus 
about problems in Yale’s comedy scene. “The show proved 
that this kind of night had value,” she said.
ENTERING THE SCENE
Chloe Prendergast didn’t consider herself funny before 
coming to Yale. But when she became the Art Director of the 
Yale Record, the country’s oldest college humor magazine, 
she was told she didn’t need to be. Anyone can pitch a car­
toon; she just needed to approve the image.

Prendergast said it’s unlikely she would have said yes 
to stand-up without the encouragement of an experienced 
woman comedian, the Record’s then Editor-in-Chief, Rachel 
Lackner. Lackner was one of the few recurring woman per­
formers at Yale’s amateur open mic night, the Cucumber, 
and encouraged Prendergast to perform. Today, Prender­
gast is both the Record’s publisher and a staple on the Yale 
stand-up circuit. 

She’s not the only one. Grace Wynter, a stand-up come­
dian and member of the Sphincter Troupe, said, “When I 
was 14, I told my friend that I want to be the Black Tina 
Fey. I didn’t consider myself a funny person; I was just some­
one who liked comedy.” A personal outreach message from 
Sphincter motivated her to audition.

Zoë Loewenberg, the former director of musical improv 
group Just Add Water (of which I am also a member) was 
discouraged from comedy for another reason: “Improv is not 
cute. You don’t look hot doing improv. It’s high risk. Comedy 
is counter to my gender role.”

Just this year, at one set of auditions for stand-up troupe 
The Opening, fifteen men and one woman turned up. Lane 
Unsworth, director of the Cucumber, didn’t find that surpris­
ing. “I get reached out to by guys but I need to reach out to 
girls [when recruiting for shows],” she said. “Being a woman 
in charge made recruiting women much easier.”

And stand-up isn’t the only comedic extracurricular facing 
concerns about representation. A meta-scene performed by 
the sketch troupe Fifth Humour last year highlighted similar 
issues. The scene began with Addee Kim trying to recall her 
favorite sketch from a previous Fifth Humour show. She told 
cast member Zoe Ervolino that one of the performers was this 
“white guy, darkish hair and sort of Jewish.” That description 
didn’t narrow it down. So, on the command of her whistle, 
Ervolino summoned the male members of Fifth Humour to 
march shamefacedly onto the stage. The group resembled a 
police line-up: nine white, dark-haired men. While the bit 
was specific to Fifth Humour, the point it made speaks to 
racial and gender disparities in Yale’s comedy scene at large.

According to Prendergast, Last Comic Standing was the 
final catalyst in the creation of The Coven. Organized every 
year by the Yale College Council, Last Comic Standing 
offers any undergraduate comedian the chance to open for 
an established comic. The winners are determined both by 
YCC judges and popular vote. In last’s year’s competition, 
three of the seven finalists were women, but not one made it 
into the top three. “I very much disagreed with the outcome 
of that show,” says Prendergast. “And I wasn’t the only one.” 
For her, this result reinforced a truth about Yale comedy: 
Women aren’t just underrepresented, they’re underappreci­
ated too. That same night, the idea for The Coven was born.
“THAT’S NOT A PHONE, IT’S A BANANA”
Not only are women discouraged from entering the Yale 
comedy scene: once they join, they often face unique diffi­
culties. To foster collaboration and world-building onstage, 
for instance, many improvisers have been taught a cardinal 
rule: “Make your partner look good.” But woman improvisers 
at Yale say they can’t always count on their male counterparts 
to follow it.

In a “long-form” game at one group’s show a few years 
ago, the premise was a madcap one. To tie up the ending of 
the story, one character needed another character’s eyes. But 
a male performer had developed a joke about his character 
refusing to give away his cornea. A woman improviser tried to 
end the story, but the male performer denied her because his 
‘cornea’ joke was getting a lot of laughs, making the woman 
the butt of the joke rather than its architect. Zoe Ervolino,

Fifth Humour, and director of an improv group, The Viola
