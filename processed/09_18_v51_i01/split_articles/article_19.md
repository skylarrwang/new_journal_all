money. But he hopes the promised jobs will trigger a chain 
reaction. Bridgeporters will go back to work. They’ll buy 
houses instead of renting. They’ll raise their kids here, send­
ing them to schools improved and beautified with casino 
money. They’ll have what Roussas calls “pride of owner­
ship.” They’ll be happier. 
“That’s all it takes—one thing like this to spark things up,” 
Roussas said. “That’s what we’re looking for.”


Thirty miles north on Highway 8, in 
Waterbury, another former factory town, 
Scott Nelson thinks a casino will affect 
his city, too. Nelson is the director of 
problem gambling services for Midwestern Connecticut 
Council of Alcoholism, an addiction treatment center here.
“If you’re within a fifty-five-mile radius of a casino,” Nel­
son told me, “your chances of developing a gambling issue 
go up.” In a 1999 report to Congress, the National Gambling 
Impact Study Commission cited evidence that problem and 
pathological gambling were twice as prevalent within fifty 
miles of a casino. Recent studies have found a similar cor­
relation. Nelson explains this in terms of access. “The more 
accessible gambling is, the more people tend to participate 
in it,” he said. “And once you are in that environment, cer­
tain risk factors have the opportunity to take hold.”


Right now, lottery scratchers are the biggest problem for 
Nelson’s gambling clients. Fantasy sports betting is growing. 
If a casino opened in Bridgeport—fifty-five minutes away 
by train or thirty minutes by car—Nelson would anticipate 
more clients with slot-machine addictions. But he wouldn’t 
expect them right away. “Nobody goes to the casino for the 
first time, loses more than they intended, and then immedi­
ately walks in the door to see us,” he said. “There’s a pattern 
of problems over months, years—decades in some cases—
before they’re able to get through the door to see us.”


Melodie Keen, the director of outpatient services at Con­
necticut Renaissance, a behavioral therapy center in Nor­
walk, agreed. “By the time I see people,” she said, “they’ve 
lost everything.”


If MGM Bridgeport opens, Nelson believes the patients 
at his clinic will be especially vulnerable. Some have crimi­
nal records. Many are people of color. Few are affluent. All 
these factors put them at a higher risk for gambling addic­
tion, he said. Research bears out Nelson’s concern. Accord­
ing to a paper by Dr. Timothy Fong of the UCLA Gambling 
Studies Program, lower socioeconomic status correlates 
with more severe gambling problems, and African-Ameri­
cans, Latinos, Asians, and American Indians are all overrep­
resented among pathological gamblers—as are individuals 
with a history of substance abuse.


“But it can happen to anyone,” said Keen. Her Norwalk 
clients include high rollers ferried to casinos in private jets 
or limos and given complimentary suites once they arrive.


Representative Juan Candelaria of New Haven, who 
co-sponsored the casino bill last session, said he was sym­
pathetic to concerns about gambling problems but that it’s 
ultimately a question of individual autonomy. “I mean, no 
one is obligated to gamble,” he told me. 


“We make that choice,” Rep. Candelaria added. “And 
yes, opening up the casino opens up, probably, the ability 
for the individuals to go and gamble, but at the end of the 
day, it’s the individual’s choice.” 


Many Americans feel that way, said Nelson, the Water­
bury clinician. In a recent poll, 51 percent of respondents 
named “moral weakness” as a likely cause of gambling ad­
diction. But the idea that gambling addiction involves more 
of a choice—and thus more of a personal failing—than drug 
addiction is false, Nelson said. “I always think about it this 
way,” he said. “If somebody with a gambling addiction could 
bottle up that feeling they get from sitting at the card table, 
put it into a syringe, and inject it into their arms so they 
didn’t have to leave the house to go to the table, they would 
do that.”


Some MGM backers have argued that the potential harm 
to a small number of individuals with gambling addictions 
shouldn’t stop Bridgeport and Connecticut from collecting 
the revenue they need. “I talk to a lot of people who deal 
with a lot of things,” Stallworth, the pastor, told me, “and I 
think I’ve had one person who said to me, you know, ‘I have 
a gambling problem.’” 


Meanwhile, Rep. Candelaria said, casinos work for every­
one else. “That revenue is creating not only jobs,” Rep. Can­
delaria said, but also “going to different areas, where people 
will benefit at the end of the day.”


Nelson compared this framing to the arguments drug 
manufacturers have advanced to avoid liability for fueling 
the opiate epidemic. “‘We developed this medicine in good 
faith, and if some people misused it and it led them to her­
oin, that’s not our problem’,” he said. While gambling ad­
diction doesn’t lead to overdoses, it can be lethal. As many 
as one in five compulsive gamblers—a higher rate than any 
other addiction—attempt suicide, according to statistics 
from the National Council on Problem Gambling.


According to Dr. Earl Grinols, an economist at Baylor 
University who has studied casinos’ social costs, gambling 
addiction will likely claim more victims if Bridgeport gets its 
casino. “Some of them will commit suicide,” he said. “Some 
of them will engage in crime, like embezzlement. There’s 
no doubt it’s going to cause those things. The question is, is 
that at a level that’s acceptable to the state of Connecticut?”


But where casinos are concerned, Nelson suggested, 
Connecticut may have passed the point of coolly weighing 
risks and benefits. The state hit a kind of jackpot once be­
fore, winning millions in revenue from Foxwoods and Mo­
hegan Sun. Now, as competition increases and money gets 
tighter, lawmakers want to try their luck again. 


A potent psychological factor in gambling addiction, Nel­
son said, is “the fantasy of gambling creating a life-changing 
event.” It’s unique to gambling, and it’s one reason casinos 
can be so compelling—both for individual gamblers and for 
the cities and states that host casinos. “Nobody with an alco­
hol addiction can pick up a beer and think to themselves, ‘If 
I drink this next beer, my life can be drastically changed,’” 
he said. But gamblers can dream. So can Bridgeport.
