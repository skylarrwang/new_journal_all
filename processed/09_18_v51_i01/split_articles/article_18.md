off eight hundred employees, the Pequots stopped paying 
stipends to tribal members, forcing some families to rely on 
a communal food bank. (In the boom years, those annual 
stipends had exceeded $100,000 for each adult.)


Chuck Bunnell, the Mohegan Tribe’s chief of staff, told 
me he thinks MGM Bridgeport will never materialize. “Ob­
viously, let’s hope it doesn’t,” he said. “But, if we’re being 
honest with each other, we have to accept that that would 
cause layoffs and be devastating for this region of the state.” 
And adjusting for competition from MGM Springfield is 
“inevitable,” Bunnell said. The tribes will try to keep down­
sized workers employed until the East Windsor casino 
opens—2020 at the earliest—so they can transfer there, he 
said. Although most employees aren’t members of the tribe, 
Bunnell said, the Mohegans “consider their employees part 
of their extended family.”


But transferring to East Windsor, halfway across the 
state, isn’t an option for Melissa. “I have thought about it,” 
she said, “but I’m divorced and I have two kids. The travel 
would take too big of a toll.”

Nick Roussas, the owner of Frankie’s 
Diner in Bridgeport, started out bussing 
tables at the age of 9.  By 12 he was cook­
ing burgers and fries on the line. Now, 
at 41, Roussas is the president of the neighborhood redevel­
opment zone, a marshal for the Juneteenth parade, and a 
board member for six nonprofits. He’s also a near-daily pres­
ence at the diner, where he works at least 50 hours a week. 
Roussas has three rules for conversations with custom­
ers: “You don’t take sides on religion, politics, or baseball.” 
He bends two of them. It’s no secret that Roussas is a die-
hard Yankees fan. He’s taken a side in the casino debate, 
too. “Why can’t we have something like the Yankees here in 


And more are coming. MGM Springfield, a billion-dollar 
gambling resort, opened in Massachusetts last month. Wynn 
is building a casino near Boston. Over the summer, MGM 
bought a century-old racetrack and slot parlor in Yonkers, 
New York, which industry observers expect will expand 
dramatically. To compete, the Connecticut tribes plan to 
construct a “satellite” casino in East Windsor, Connecti­
cut—just 17 miles from Springfield. The idea, which won 
the legislature’s approval in 2016, is to intercept gamblers 
heading north for the border.


According to MGM, a casino in Bridgeport will do the 
same things, but better, potentially earning Connecticut 
more than Foxwoods and Mohegan combined. Bridgeport 
is closer to major population hubs like New York. But a casi­
no there would break Connecticut’s compact with the tribes 
and throw the future of Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun into 
doubt.


Melissa believes workers like her will suffer no matter 
what happens. “The more casinos you have,” she said, “the 
worse it is for us.” She’s been at Foxwoods for 17 years, off 
and on, and remembers the downturn when Twin River 
Casino opened an hour away in Rhode Island. “There’ll be 
layoffs,” she predicted.


Dr. Barrow’s data support Melissa’s fears. “There’s no 
doubt,” he said, “that if you open a third casino in Con­
necticut, some of its revenues will be cannibalized” from 
Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun. In a 2015 study, Dr. Barrow’s 
consulting firm predicted that increased competition could 
cost the two casinos as many as 5,800 jobs by 2019. The 
only downturn approaching that scale to date was during the 
Great Recession. Hundreds of workers and tribal members 
lost their livelihoods then. In 2010, still insolvent after laying
