tional and language barriers often prevent tenants from 
appearing in court. Some tenants also worry about jeop­
ardizing their employment or think that nothing can be 
done to fight the eviction.


But Connecticut does have a well-established sys­
tem for resolving housing cases: a housing mediation 
program designed to give the landlord and tenant an 
opportunity to reach an agreement without going to 
trial. During meetings ranging from ten minutes to an 
hour, mediation specialists resolve over 90 percent of 
cases, according to Alexandra Gillett, who has worked as 
a mediation specialist since 2012.


“Oftentimes, the situation that arose to bring you to 
housing court wasn’t catastrophic—it was temporary,” 
Gillett explains. “All we need to do is make a plan to 
help them manage the payments.” Sometimes, however, 
the best solution for both parties is a “graceful exit strat­
egy.” The rare case not resolved in mediation goes to 
trial, usually the same day.


Housing mediation specialists, legal aid attorneys and 
social service providers have seen the adverse effects 
of Connecticut’s budget crisis on their ability to help 
low-income renters. According to Erin Kemple, of the 
Connecticut Fair Housing Center, security deposit 
guarantee programs—which help low-income people 
find housing by giving landlords a guarantee of the first 
month’s rent—have been largely eliminated statewide. 
Gillett says she’s seen “a further limiting of already 
incredibly limited resources.” She adds that there used 
to be agencies to which she could refer tenants for 
back-rent assistance, or landlords for energy assistance. 
“Those programs have all but dried up, unfortunately,” 
she says.


COLLATERAL DAMAGE
Eviction strips a tenant of housing stability and jeop­
ardizes their ability to find a new home, but its effects 
can be much farther-reaching. The stress and logistical 
difficulties of experiencing an eviction can make it hard 
to hold down a job. And eviction can leave psychologi­
cal scars, often leading to increased rates of depression.


“When you get evicted you lose not only your home 
but your neighborhood and your school. You also lose 
your stuff, which is taken by movers or put on a side­
walk,” says Matthew Desmond, a professor of sociol­
ogy at Princeton University and author of the Pulitzer 
Prize–winning book Evicted. “Eviction comes with a 
mark which can prevent you from moving into a good 
neighborhood and decent housing because landlords 
turn you away.”


The Eviction Lab estimates that 2.3 million people 
were evicted in America in 2016, which, Desmond 
notes, is thirty-six times the number of people who died 
from opioid overdoses.  The scale of the problem is enor­
mous, he says—and it’s “absolutely underestimated” 
due to the lack of transparency and significant gaps in 
eviction record data from municipal governments.


“I think that when we add all that up, we are forced 
to the conclusion that eviction isn’t just a condition of 
poverty, it’s a cause of poverty,” Desmond says.


Last spring, Dr. Jack Tsai, an associate professor of 
psychology at Yale and staff psychologist at the Veterans 
Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System, was in the midst 
of running a nine-month observational study of tenants 
who appear in New Haven Housing Court for eviction 
cases. Every few months, he and his team checked in 
with about fifty participants to track their mental health. 
In his study, Dr. Tsai says, there were several instances 
in which participants reported suicidal thoughts. 


“Evictions are a lose-lose situation,” he says. “They’re 
stressful for the tenants, but they’re stressful for the 
landlords, too. And it’s a loss for society because people 
aren’t invested in their communities anymore.”


On average, New Haven landlords lose about $3,000 
during an eviction, a combination of the tenants’ unpaid 
rent, fees paid to the state marshal for eviction paper­
