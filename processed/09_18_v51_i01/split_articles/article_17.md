port of it, ‘You can’t legislate morality,’ Leighton said. “It’s 
like, wait a minute, we do that all the time: ‘Thou shalt not 
kill.’”

But Stallworth said he feels no tension between politics 
and faith on this issue. “I’m in the same place as a pastor, as 
a person, as a politician,” he said. “I support it. I have stood 
in my church and said, ‘I’m looking forward for it to come.’ 
I hope it comes.”

By March, the two East End pastors were manning op­
posite sides of the barricades. Stallworth signed on as a 
sponsor of House Bill 5305, which would set up a bidding 
process for a new casino with requirements roughly tracking 
MGM’s proposal. Leighton, meanwhile, joined the Con­
necticut Coalition Against Casino Expansion (CACE) and 
testified against the bill. “Gambling may be entertaining for 
some,” he said at a legislative hearing, “but for many whose 
stories are too shameful to tell, gambling causes casualties.”

Leighton told me opposing the casino can feel isolating. 
His impression is that the overwhelming majority of Bridge­
port residents want it. (In a poll of registered Bridgeport vot­
ers MGM commissioned last fall, 74 percent said they were 
in favor.) Michele Mudrick, one of the coalition’s founders, 
said CACE is outmatched financially as well. “It’s like a Da­
vid and Goliath fight we have here,” Mudrick told me in 
April. “We have $800 in the bank[…] and they’re literally 
spending hundreds of thousands of dollars.”

In May, as the 2018 legislative session closed, Stallworth’s 
bill passed the Connecticut House of Representatives. Four 
days later, short on votes, the bill’s sponsors in the Senate 
withdrew it, promising to come back stronger in 2019. In 
another round of direct-mail flyers later that month, MGM 
vowed to continue the fight. “With support from people 
like you,” the flyer said, “we are closer than ever” to victory. 
Since then, the battlefield has gone quiet. But both sides are 
preparing for the bill’s return.    


**Connecticut Casinos: A Shifting Landscape**

II.   UNCASVILLE
On the winding route to Mohe­
gan Sun, one of two casinos that tow­
er over the oak and hickory forests of 
southeastern Connecticut, the snow is 
falling heavier now and sticking. It’s a Wednesday night in 
March, and I’ve taken a wrong turn onto a road the plows 
haven’t reached. Cars move slowly, following each other’s 
tire-tracks. Others have given up, or drifted too far onto the 
shoulder; they wait in the darkness, hazard lights blinking. 
It’s supposed to snow like this until morning.

It’s warm inside the casino, where there are no windows 
to gauge the weather outside. The gambling floor is vast, 
spanning more than 300,000 square feet. In one section, 
simulated stars dot the ceiling. In another, animatronic 
wolves turn their heads as if scanning for prey. The flashing 
lights on slot machines—old ones, squat with metal han­
dles, and new ones shaped like giant smartphones—blur in 
the cigarette smoke and artificial waterfall mist.

Melissa, who declined to give her last name, got off work 
about an hour ago. She’s slouched in her seat, watching a 
video interlude on a “Sex and the City” slot machine. Later 
tonight, she’ll brave the roads home to North Stonington, 
where her two kids are waiting. I ask why she’s here. “Be­
cause I work at the other one,” she responds. “I can’t gamble 
there.”

The other one is Foxwoods Resort Casino, 10 miles away 
on the Mashantucket Pequot Reservation. When it opened 
in 1992, Foxwoods was the only casino in New England; 
within a few years, it was the world’s largest. The Mohe­
gans—relatives and onetime enemies of the Mashantucket 
Pequots—received federal recognition as a tribe in 1994, 
and opened Mohegan Sun here in Uncasville two years 
later. For the next decade, this corner of Connecticut at­
tracted gamblers from all over the East Coast. Back then, an 
old-timer at the penny slots told me, there was a line behind 
every machine.

Slot machines are illegal in Connecticut. But on tribal 
lands, state gambling restrictions, like indoor smoking laws, 
apply differently. Back in the ‘90s, the state promised the 
tribes a monopoly on slots; in return, the tribes would pay 
Connecticut 25 percent of their slot-machine winnings. The 
state’s most profitable year was 2006—payments for that 
year totaled $430 million. Then came the financial crisis. 
By 2012, Foxwoods was $2.3 billion in debt. The Mohegans 
owed $1.6 billion. And they were encircled by competitors: 
New casinos had popped up in Rhode Island, New York, 
Pennsylvania, and Maine.

With more regional rivals, Connecticut’s casinos have 
since shrunk their gambling floors and expanded into tamer 
forms of entertainment: an outlet mall, an expo center, a 
33-story zip-line, a WNBA team. As of late 2016, Foxwoods 
and Mohegan Sun employed 43 percent fewer people than 
in 2006. The two casinos still accounted for over 13,000 
jobs, and operated more than 7,000 slot machines. But last 
year, those machines won the state just $270 million.

Dr. Clyde Barrow, a University of Texas economist who 
consults for the tribes, told me the number of casinos in the 
Northeast has exploded since 2006—from 12 to nearly 70. 
 “I’ve heard people say, who are 
in support of it, ‘You can’t leg­
islate morality,’ Leighton said. 
“It’s like, wait a minute, we do 
that all the time: ‘Thou shalt 
not kill.’”
