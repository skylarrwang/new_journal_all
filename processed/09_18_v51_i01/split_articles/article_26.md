ost first-years walk into their dorms knowing little 
more about their suitemates than their names, who’s 
bringing the microwave, and the Facebook likes from middle 
school that still haunt each person’s profile. (A highlight from 
my freshman suite: “Bring back the word ‘wizard’ as an adjec­
tive.”) 

The residential college deans are the ones who do the heavy 
lifting for roommate selection, with the aid of that (very) cursory 
survey the prefrosh fill out. All I remember from that survey 
is marking “no country, no metal” under “what music would 
bother me,” only to wake up on the second day of college with 
Kenny Chesney’s crooning wafting up into the top bunk. At 
least it wasn’t Megadeth. 

Sometimes it seems like the residential college deans 
approach putting together suites like piecing together a compli­
cated jigsaw puzzle, and sometimes it’s like they’re playing Dr. 
Frankenstein. Either way, they do have students’ best interests at 
heart. It’s just hard to see how people will react to living in close 
quarters, the same way it’s hard to predict what your roommate 
will do if you tell them they need new, better deodorant. 

Margaret Clark, head of Trumbull College, makes it clear 
that she doesn’t use Trumbull students in her study of close 
relationships at the Yale Psychology department, but she can 
tell you some things about what makes relationships succeed. 
(She focuses less on what makes relationships fail—for more on 
that, consult the monograph I’m coauthoring with my former 
suitemates: The Case of the Missing Oreo-Cheesecake Bars: A 
Model of Interpersonal Discord vis-à-vis the Macronutrients of 
a Scarce Resource (Goode, Zevallos, Vernick, and Macey, In 
Press). 

In her previous position at Carnegie Mellon University, 
Clark worked on a study of the university’s randomly paired 
freshmen, analyzing the factors that made for a happy dorm. 
“What we found,” Clark said, “was that people with different 
academic interests were much more likely to stick with each 
other the next year.” It turns out that an engineer and an actor 
won’t compare themselves to each other as much as the suite of 
kids in Directed Studies who’ll worry all year about who under­
stands Hegel the best. (Spoiler: none of them.)

In another study, punderfully titled “The Positives of Nega­
tive Emotions,” Clark and others looked at incoming students’ 
willingness to express fear, anxiety, and sadness before arriving 
at college. At the end of the year, the researchers used a ques­
tionnaire to determine how many friends each participant had 
made. Students who were more willing to express their negative 
emotions made more friends. As Clark explained, you can’t be 
supportive if your suitemate never tells you that something is 
wrong.

Because of the complete lack of pressure to put up a façade of 
success and well being at Yale, I am sure no student here could 
learn from this study, and we can move along.


Trouble getting along with your roommate? It’s all in your head.

My own residential college dean explained to my freshman 
suite that we’d been placed together because three out of our 
four had mentioned something vaguely outdoorsy in the incom­
ing survey. Our pursuits—backpacking, flyfishing, and bee­
keeping—actually have little in common, but they do literally 
take place out-of-doors, so points there. (You might be wonder­
ing about how our fourth suitemate came to be grouped with us; 
we are too.) Clark confirmed that, in theory, my suite had been 
well-matched since having a similar interest in outdoor activi­
ties gave us something to do together without much room for 
unhealthy comparison. We never once did anything outdoors 
together, though, and our only regular group activity was tearing 
apart the suite looking for  ID when he lost it. But that’s also 
an activity without much room for unhealthy comparison, so it 
worked out.

Ultimately, there is only one year of semi-random pairing at 
Yale. Upperclassman housing affords you more choice, so the 
odds of living with someone who drunkenly wets the bed and 
sleeps on a bare mattress rather than laundering the sheets are 
much lower. As are the odds of your roommate taking a bottle 
of Febreze Hawaiian Aloha to your guest’s eyes with intent to 
blind. They probably won’t pee in jars, or put every item you 
own in condoms while you’re visiting home one weekend (all 
documented suitemate behavior). A lot of the reduction in 
roommate craziness happens because you’ll have the chance to 
cohabitate with someone a bit more compatible. As Clark puts 
it, “similarity cuts both ways.” Difference decreases comparison, 
but too much difference can make for interpersonal discord.

I asked Clark what her advice to incoming first-years would 
be. She said they shouldn’t compare themselves to their suitem­
ates, or to anyone else, for that matter. And if you want to know 
why your roommate is up into the wee hours doing jumping 
jacks in the common room, or what they think of the merits of 
“wizard” as an adjective, or whether you can have one of the 
Oreo-cheesecake bars stacked bottom to top in the fridge, or 
how on earth they could enjoy Kenny Chesney—just ask them.
