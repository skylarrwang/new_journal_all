Dear readers,
On August 24, Old Campus was in a state of happy chaos. Upperclassmen movers cheered as bewildered first years 
lugged duffel bags, posters, and futons to their dorms.

Just over a week earlier, on the other side of College St., the New Haven Green had been host to a very different kind 
of commotion when first responders rushed to the scene of a mass K2 overdose. Around the city, paramedics ferried more 
than 70 people, all reeling from a bad batch of synthetic marijuana laced with fentanyl, to the hospital. As Yale opened 
its iron gates to the 1,578 members of the class of 2022, the outbreak served as a reminder of the stark inequality between 
the university and the city it calls home. 

That dichotomy is profound, and it matters. But we’d like to encourage our readers to look beyond it, to consider Yale 
and New Haven’s complexities and the ways that the city and university are intertwined.

The New Journal was founded in 1967 as the Magazine of Yale and New Haven. Our mission is to write critically and 
thoughtfully about our campus and our city. Students: We publish five issues a year, and we’re always looking for writers, 
photographers, and designers for both print and web. No experience necessary––we’re equally committed to publishing 
compelling pieces and making creative nonfiction accessible to and inclusive of all voices on campus. The reporting for 
our cover story this issue, on the battle against cash bail, was funded by the Edward Bennett III Memorial Fund, created 
in honor of an alumnus who revived this publication in the 1980s after suffering a severe spinal cord injury and went on 
to become the first quadriplegic to graduate from Yale College. It’s our hope that this fund will make ambitious reporting 
projects financially feasible for anyone who’s interested. So if you have an idea for a story, pitch us this fall!

A big thank you to our dedicated editors, who spent much of their summers helping our writers report and sculpt the 
narratives you’ll read here, and who spent 12+ hours a day last week hunting down typos in a small, stifling room with only 
one (semi-functional) fan. 

We hope you enjoy our features, which take a frank look at criminal justice and eviction in New Haven and at the battle 
brewing in Bridgeport, our neighbor to the west, over a plan to bring a casino to town. Also in this issue: read about the 
women transforming Yale’s comedy scene, the world of digital archives at Sterling Memorial Library, the psychology of 
roommate pairings, and lots more. Happy reading––and, as always, we’d love to hear from you.
