Fund employee goes down to their holding cell and 
offers to post bail. Most clients assume the BFF 
expects a refund. But in reality, they’ll never have to 
pay the money back.


For all the legal entanglements and cross-city 
scrambles that precede it, the act of setting someone 
free is anticlimactic: the person posting bail presents 
a cashier’s check to a clerical worker behind a glass 
window. Paying for someone’s freedom looks more 
like a trip to the DMV than a singular act of justice.


A few days later, at the initial court date, employ­
ees of the Freedom Fund wade through the hallway 
commotion. One by one, they read out the names of 
their clients for the day, calling them loudly in the 
hallways and shout-whispering them in courtrooms. 
Each client receives a version of the same speech: an 
introduction to the employee, the organization, and 
a reminder that the only thing the Freedom Fund 
needs is their continued attendance at court. Every 
meeting between a Freedom Fund representative 
and a client in pretrial detention ends with a sim­
ple question: “Do you need our help with anything 
outside of bail?” Some clients are in search of a job, 
some need help finding housing, some are looking 
for affordable health care, and some just need a pre-
paid phone. These people are pointed towards a cli­
ent advocate like Yonah Zeitz, a full-time case man­
ager and bail payer.


The fund’s client advocacy branch exists because 
paying someone’s bail doesn’t solve all their prob­
lems. “If they’re not able to get stability once they’re 
out,” Zeitz asks, “then what’s the point of paying 
their bail?” In the immediate aftermath of pretrial 
detention, clients typically need help with material 
needs: finding a job, a place to live, or someone to 
look after their kids. The Fund tries to connect them 
to the resources they need to get back on their feet 
post-detention.


Through The Bail Project, the Freedom Fund is 
expanding its model to other cities where cash bail is 
a pervasive problem. But New Haven’s bail fund isn’t 
part of this growing network; it stands alone. The 
organization demonstrates a radical approach that 
could fundamentally change how people in New 
Haven fight for justice.


The Connecticut Bail Fund (CBF) occupies a 
single, street-level room on Grand Avenue in Fair 
Haven. The space inside is as modest as the unassum­
ing brick façade. A small waiting area, with wooden 
floors and simple chairs, takes up most of the room; 
the desks of its two employees are shoved towards the 
back. Compared to the Hall of Justice, it feels much 
more inviting.


On Wednesday nights, CBF’s office hosts a sup­
port group for people the organization has bailed out 
and their loved ones. The visitors pile into the mod­
est space, hoping either to strategize about their legal 
cases or simply vent about their troubles. They share 
stories of aggressive correctional officers, insensitive 
lawyers, and bullheaded judges.


This past April, Sharon* was arrested for assault 
and disorderly conduct (she wished to remain anon­
ymous; Sharon is a pseudonym). She couldn’t afford 
her $2,500 bail. After a week in jail, she received 
a visit from Ana María Rivera-Forastieri, the co-di­
rector of CBF. Rivera-Forastieri explained that the 
bail fund was an organization dedicated to helping 
people like Sharon, and told her that if she accepted 
their offer to pay bail on her behalf, she would be 
free the next day. She eagerly accepted.


Sharon feels she has been given a precious oppor­
tunity—one that she doesn’t want to waste. “I’m in 
women’s wellness, relapse prevention, anger man­
agement, those types of things, so that my time out­
side of jail is actually being put to use,” she said. 
Programs like these are often mandated by a judge. 
Sharon attends each of them voluntarily.


Sharon is part of CBF’s support group. Giving 
support at these meetings means as much to her as 
receiving it. “I think that it’s also important for a lot 
of these people getting out of jail to see that there’s 
someone who’s been formerly homeless, and who’s 
been in a lot of those crappy conditions, and is still 
fighting a case, and can still find a way to stay sober,” 
she said. “I just want to encourage others that it is 
possible.”


CBF has bailed out 140 people since its found­
ing in 2017. Their organization is smaller than the 
Bronx Freedom Fund, and eschews The Bail Proj­
ect’s sweeping approach. That’s intentional: CBF’s 
work hinges on intimate, prolonged collaboration 
with formerly incarcerated New Haveners, whether 
through support groups, rallies, or a performing arts 
group that started meeting biweekly this summer. 
“They’ve been learning about how to use the story 
of self,” Rivera-Forastieri said. “At every meeting,

they talk about what they’ve experienced in the com­
munity, living on the streets or having lived on the 
streets.”


After bail is posted, the organization pushes to 
provide its smaller, tight-knit group of clients with 
opportunities for activist engagement and self-expres­
sion, placing them at the forefront of their commu­
nity. The strength of the Freedom Fund lies in its 
individual case management, in connecting individ­
ual clients with the material resources they are seek­
ing as they exit the criminal justice system. CBF’s 
strength, in contrast, lies in the comfort that Sharon 
finds in attending the CBF’s weekly meetings—a 
comfort that is rooted in the emotional support fos­
tered by a close-knit community.


The different approaches of CBF and BFF mean 
that the two organizations have necessarily diverging 
end goals. BFF and The Bail focus on quantity. “Our 
mission, first and foremost, is we want to bail out 
as many people as humanly possible,” said Camilo 
Ramirez, The Bail Project’s communications direc­
tor. “And we want to do that because the human 
cost of waiting is too great.” They want to galvanize 
a national movement, rather than focusing solely on 
a single community.


To their staff, the practice of cash bail causes the 
systematic destruction of communities, and decon­
structing it presents the swiftest path to empower­
ment. “Community building cannot occur at all 
while community members are incarcerated,” said 
Alex Anthony, former director of BFF’s Queens 
Branch.


As a result, a key part of The Bail Project’s work 
involves legislative reform. “We feel very optimistic 
that bail reform is the one battle that we might win 
in the criminal justice system,” Ramirez said. Since 
2012, almost every state legislature has addressed 
pretrial injustice. Illinois now requires a rehearing 
within seven days for anyone held on cash bail, and 
judges in New Jersey are required to employ a risk 
assessment tool to discern whether or not a defen­
dant should be released pretrial. The Bail Project 
is working to back more legislation like this with an 
even more radical end goal: to end cash bail.


Connecticut, too, has enacted bold reform. Legis­
lation passed last year made it illegal for judges to set 
bail on misdemeanor cases unless the defendant has 
a long history of missing court dates. That same bill 
prohibited judges from setting cash-only bail, mean­
ing people in New Haven will never have to pay the 
entire bail amount up front, out of pocket: they can 
either pay a portion of their bail amount (usually 
around ten percent), or enlist a bail bondsman to 
help them pay. As Senator Bob Godfrey explained on 
the floor of the State Assembly, “If you’re a million­
aire, [a $2,000 bail] is half a day’s pay, and if you’re 
making minimum wage, is 25 days’ pay. I don’t think 
that’s justice for anyone, let alone for all.”


Just over 3,300 people in Connecticut were in pre­
trial detention as of December 2016, according to a 
2017 study by the Connecticut Sentencing Commis­
sion. In New York City, meanwhile, an average of 
7,100 people were held in pretrial detention on any 
given day in 2017, according to data released by the 
city’s Department of Corrections this March. Last 
year’s changes could propel Connecticut forward.


Even though the recent reforms may help their 
clients, CBF doesn’t focus on lobbying. According 
to Rivera-Forastieri, when the voices of formerly 
incarcerated people aren’t prioritized, “bullsh*t 
reform gets passed in the legislature that has little 
to no effect on the ground. Our objective is to build 
power in communities. If that’s what people want, 
they should be leading that conversation.”


For example, CBF’s clients haven’t shown a strong 
interest in pushing for the total elimination of bail, 
so the organization hasn’t thrown its weight behind 
that kind of proposal. “To try to organize people 
around bail abolition, specifically, I think would feel 
coercive and not really meeting people where they’re 
at,” co-founder Brett Davidson explained.


This mantra—meeting people where they’re at—
traces back to CBF’s founding. All four of CBF’s 
founders were Yale students. When they received 
the seed money from Yale necessary to jumpstart the 
organization, their first order of business was con­
ducting listening sessions throughout New Haven. 
They wanted to hear from formerly incarcerated 
people about their ideal bail fund, an approach that 
would guide their game plan. To ensure the orga­
nization would be truly led by New Haveners, they 
hired Rivera-Forastieri, a bilingual community orga­
nizer with a law degree who had worked with Junta 
for Progressive Action, a local nonprofit that advo­
cates for New Haven’s Latinx community.


In sharp contrast to The Bail Project, CBF isn’t fix­

ated on bailing out as many people as possible. The 
way to effectively serve New Haven, according to the 
Connecticut Bail Fund, is to give its clients a sense 
of ownership over the organization. “We could be 
bailing out many more people a week if that was our 
sole focus, but that’s not our sole focus,” said Rive­
ra-Forastieri. “Organizing and building power is our 
number one focus.”


To CBF, a bailout is a crucial transition point at 
which the organization can help start a process of 
transformation, placing criminalized people in con­
trol. “We form relationships with people in crisis 
moments and build trust that way,” explains David­
son. Those relationships allow their clients to lever­
age CBF’s resources towards social justice causes 
across the board. In 2017, the CBF mobilized local 
activists to protest the lack of housing resources in 
New Haven; this past July, they helped organize a 
rally to abolish ICE. Later that month, CBF helped 
bring together an event that exemplified its philoso­
phy.


Tiheba Bain has never applied for a job online. 
Classified ads were still the norm when she entered 
federal prison in 1997. When she was released in 
2007, she remembered, “I came home with the 
clothes on my back and maybe one hundred dollars 
in my pocket. Maybe.” But she also had a head full 
of ideas of how the criminal justice system needed to 
change—especially for women. For four years, Bain 
commuted from Bridgeport to Manhattan in order 
to work and receive her degree in Psychology and 
Women in Criminal Justice from the City University 
of New York.


This summer, Bain organized an event with the 
support of a sprawling network of community organi­
zations and nonprofits, including a local immigrants’ 
rights organization, Unidad Latina en Acción (ULA); 
Planned Parenthood of Southeast New England; and 
the National Council for Incarcerated and Formerly 
Incarcerated Women and Girls. The CBF gave her 
a space (First and Summerfield United Methodist 
Church on the New Haven Green), secured funding, 
and connected her with community members inter­
ested in attending the town hall. In mid-July, thirty 
community members gathered with representatives 
from these groups to discuss Bain’s biggest ambition: 
“‘How can we end mass incarceration for women and 
girls? How do we get there?’”


While The Bail Project wants to mobilize commu­
nities across the country in order to eliminate cash 
bail, the Connecticut Bail Fund wants to pay bail in 
order to mobilize the community. The cash bail sys­
tem keeps low-income people locked up until trial, 
often for months or years. Through CBF’s model, 
people like Sharon and Tiheba Bain are taking 
charge.


Supporting those community members matters 
more to Davidson and Rivera-Forastieri than the 
number of people they bail out. “We want to focus 
our resources on building up a lot of leaders in our 
community who can develop the work that we do 
and who can speak about their experiences,” David­
son said. “That’s the main vision for the future: to 
create a sustained community organizing force.”
