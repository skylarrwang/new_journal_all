aid is part of the solution. And, for systemic change, 
Desmond has championed a universal housing voucher 
program, which would dramatically expand low-income 
people’s access to housing.

“Change is hard, and big change is even harder,” Des­
mond reflects. “But I do think that a lot of cities and a lot 
of folks in Washington are waking up to the fact that you 
can’t fix poverty without fixing housing.”


At the soup kitchen, Little motions to the dozen peo­
ple eating at nearby tables. “If she didn’t show up [in 
court], she would have been homeless. That’s why a lot 
of people are homeless, a lot of people sitting here.”


Little, who is fifty-six and has a Section 8 voucher, 
wants to buy a house by the time she’s sixty-five, but 
it won’t be in New Haven. It will be in North Caro­
lina, where she has some family, close to her children 
in Georgia. “The South is beautiful,” she says with a 
smile. “All my illnesses will go away. I know the country 
air makes me well. I just need to get back to it. I’m done 
here.”


After lunch, Luysterborghs and Little board a city 
bus that takes them back downtown. Luysterborghs sits 
at a window seat, Little one row behind, which is how 
they like it. Luysterborghs is friends with the driver, and 
greets nearly everyone who boards the bus by name. 
Little points out the street where she grew up. Luyster­
borghs waves at her church as they pass by.


The bus accelerates down Dixwell Avenue, past cor­
ner delis, storefront churches, and blocks upon blocks 
of clapboard houses, some with bare lawns, some with 
flowers out front. Luysterborghs smiles at each passen­
ger who passes, grateful for this warm afternoon and this 
bus that will deliver her home.

Little listen to a volunteer say a blessing before lining 
up for lunch. Today, it’s kielbasa, roast vegetables, and 
mashed potatoes.


Luysterborghs puts her tray down at an empty table, 
takes a picture of her meal on her phone, and says a 
quick prayer. Her hair is pulled back. She looks at ease, 
buoyant after the morning’s events.

“The potatoes are banging!” she exclaims to Little.


She double-checks that the Motion to Open is still 
in her handbag. She’s going to file it as soon as she can, 
hoping the whole situation will be put to rest in a few 
days.

“The legal system sucks,” Little says. “Why can’t they 
just say, ‘We made an error?’”

“Yeah,” Luysterborghs says, “the woman from Hous­
ing Authority said, ‘Yes, Grace, you’re up to date,’ and 
everything.”

“That one little paper caused all those problems,” Lit­
tle says, shaking her head.


Luysterborghs’ younger son, who just got out of rehab, 
lives in New Haven. Her eldest is also in the city, but she 
hasn’t seen him in a while. She didn’t tell them about 
the eviction proceedings, and doesn’t want to. They 
have their own problems, she says. “I just deal with it 
on my own.”


It was a traumatic process just to keep an apartment 
that often feels like it’s closing in on her. “I really don’t 
want to live at Union Avenue, but right now, it’s conve­
nient, right by the train station,” she says. Her rent will 
be $202 going forward. She wishes it was a little less, 
maybe $150. But she will have to make do. 


And of course, Luysterborghs is one of the lucky ones. 
For many renters in New Haven, a Notice to Quit Posses­
sion ends in eviction, and sometimes homelessness. As 
Luysterborghs and Little eat lunch at the soup kitchen, 
that reality seems to hover around them.


Luysterborghs nearly lost her home and hard-won 
stability to the complex, often unforgiving forces of the 
New Haven Housing Authority, the court system and 
city bureaucracy.  To her, the vast legal structure sur­
rounding evictions seemed inescapable, all-consuming, 
and she was fortunate to escape unscathed. Although 
her court appearance ended favorably, four other ten­
ants were likely put out on the street that same day. 


Desmond, for one, is optimistic that solutions to 
America’s eviction crisis exist. That’s partly because the 
housing crisis has grown so severe that it has begun to 
spread without precedent to other sectors of the econ­
omy, dragging large swaths of the population into its 
destructive wake. The problem is too big to ignore, he 
says.


There’s no right to counsel in housing court, although 
studies have shown that tenants who have access to a 
lawyer are far less likely to be evicted. Expanding legal
