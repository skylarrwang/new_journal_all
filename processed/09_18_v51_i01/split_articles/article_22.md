For Mezick, evictions are merely part of the 
job. He doesn’t usually ask tenants if they 
have another place lined up. “Everything’s 
going good, and I ask that question, and 
they’re triggered. My goal is to do this as 
quickly, legally, and peaceably as possible.”
work, and moving costs, according to a 2007 Yale Law 
School student paper by Michael Gottesman.


At an eviction one cold April morning on Gorham 
Avenue in Hamden, the landlord, a petite woman, paces 
anxiously on the front lawn while movers load up her 
tenant’s U-Haul. State Marshal Mezick tells the land­
lord to leave while the movers work, careful to keep her 
and the tenant apart. 

As the tenant packs up her second-floor apartment, 
she complains that she was just two days late with her 
rent when the landlord began eviction proceedings. Her 
young son, the hood of his sweatshirt pulled up over his 
head, watches expressionlessly as his mother and older 
brother carry bags of possessions out of the apartment. 
The U-Haul is loaded up in forty-five minutes, and the 
evicted tenant, cigarette dangling from her mouth, asks 
one of the movers for a light.

“I made a mistake renting to her,” the landlord says 
bitterly as the tenant drives off. The tenant owes her 
almost $2,000 in unpaid rent, and she’s paying $460 for 
the eviction fees, she says. “She’s had evictions, and I 
paid the price.”

For Mezick, evictions are merely part of the job. He 
doesn’t usually ask tenants if they have another place 
lined up. “Everything’s going good, and I ask that ques­

“I have on occasion served the execution and the kid 
comes to the door. I hate that,” he says. “If the kid comes 
to the door, I fold it in half and say, ‘Give this to your 
mother.’”


**Title: Holding On**

HOLDING ON
Grace Luysterborghs says that her unstable housing 
situation keeps her from living the life she most desires. 
She wants a bigger, cleaner apartment, with enough 
space for all her clothes, so she can stop wasting $200 
every month on storage fees. She wants to budget her 
money better, maybe save up for a car. She wants to be 
healthier, to eat better and exercise more. But most of 
all, she says, she wants peace of mind.

Her eviction was scheduled for 8:30 a.m. on April 
12. In the weeks leading up to that date, she tried to 
resolve the issue with her property manager at the Hous­
ing Authority, since she’d paid the outstanding rent, but 
to no avail.  She did not seek legal assistance until two 
days before her eviction, when she asked New Haven 
Legal Assistance for help filing paperwork for a tempo­
rary injunction.

On the injunction form, she marked an “x” next to 
a line stating, “The defendant has no other safe, ade­
quate, and affordable place to live, and/or cannot move 
before the date set for eviction.” She put “x”s down next 
to “The defendant suffers from a disability making it 
difficult to find replacement housing,” “The defendant 
lives in subsidized housing and may lose the subsidy if 
evicted,” and “The defendant in fact paid all rent, use 
and occupancy, and/or arrearage owed.” She attached 
photocopies of her rent receipts for January and Febru­
ary, in addition to the back pay she owed, and the full 
$202 rent for March and April.

That same day, a judge at Housing Court granted her 
a temporary injunction on the grounds that “irreparable 
harm would result to the defendant/tenant unless the 
requested relief is granted.” Her formal hearing was set 
for April 24.


**Title: Housing Session**

HOUSING SESSION
The morning of her court date, Luysterborghs wakes 
up at 7 a.m, in pain. She skips breakfast to soak in the 
bathtub, hoping to relieve her aching body. Her case­
worker picks her up and drives her the mile from her 
apartment to the New Haven County Court.

Just before 9:30 a.m., she climbs the white steps of the 
courthouse and passes between the towering columns 
into the light-filled atrium. She takes the elevator up 
to the third floor, Courtroom D: Housing Session. She 
finds a seat in the row of chairs facing the judge. Across 
from her is a box filled with attorneys and mediators. 
She’s nervous, but she prayed about her case the night 
before: “I got to give this situation to God.”

Luysterborghs’ friend Shirley Little, who lives in West 
Haven, arrives to provide emotional support. They settle 
in for a long wait. But after only ten minutes, a represen­
tative from the Housing Authority calls Luysterborghs 
over and brings her outside the courtroom. Attorneys 
and clients confer in the hallway, leaning against marble 
walls and leafing through documents. The representa­
tive explains that the Housing Authority recognizes its 
error; Grace is up to date on her rent. Luysterborghs will 
have to file a motion to open the judgment again, which 
will allow the Housing Authority to withdraw their case 
against her.

Leaving the courthouse, Luysterborghs is excited, but 
worried about getting the rest of the paperwork filled 
out. She and Little decide to take the bus to Hamden 
and have lunch at St. Ann’s Soup Kitchen, two and a 
half miles down Dixwell Avenue.
In the basement of the church, Luysterborghs and
