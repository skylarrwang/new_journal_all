EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Grace Luysterborghs lives on the fourth floor of the 
Robert T. Wolfe Apartments, in a studio apartment with 
big windows overlooking Union Station. But she likes to 
keep her curtains closed. It’s “one little box,” she says. 
There’s a bathroom right by the entrance, a tiny closet, 
a small kitchen, then her bed and dresser.


Luysterborghs was thankful when she secured her 
apartment in the Wolfe complex at 49 Union Avenue, 
a New Haven Housing Authority–owned property for 
the elderly and disabled, in early 2015. Before mov­
ing into the building, she’d lived for over fifteen years 
in a spacious apartment in West Haven. In late 2014, 
she had to stop work as a nurse’s aide to prepare for a 
knee replacement, and her landlord simultaneously 
tried to evict her, she says. She was forced out of her 
apartment—although it was never formalized—and was 
briefly homeless. Then she landed a spot in the Robert 
T. Wolfe Apartments.


Years after the surgery, the swelling in her knee has 
never really gone down, Luysterborghs says. She still has 
trouble walking. Sometimes the cramps in her legs are 
so bad that she can’t get out of bed in the morning.


When Luysterborghs moved into the Robert T. Wolfe 
Apartments, her rent was $59 a month. She prioritized 
it, and paid it on time. At the end of last year, though, 
her disability assistance went up, increasing her rent to 
$202. Her case manager at a local behavioral therapy 
program informed the Housing Authority of the change. 
But the paperwork confused Luysterborghs, and she 
accidentally submitted her old Social Security informa­
tion. The Housing Authority discovered the error after 
she’d paid the original rent, Luysterborghs says. And 
suddenly it was too late.


In January, she found an eviction notice affixed to her 
front door, informing her that she hadn’t paid her $202 
rent for that month. She had three weeks to leave.


Over the next few months, Luysterborghs met with 
her property manager to resolve the issue and paid her 
outstanding rent. But her case continued to advance 
through the court system, and the eviction loomed. 
Eventually, a hearing at housing court was set for the 
end of April.


“It’s been hectic because I’ve been dealing with a 
lot of depression, a lot of stuff,” Luysterborghs says the 
day before her hearing, sitting at China King, a takeout 
restaurant on Chapel Street.


Sixty years old, Luysterborghs has a wide face and 
blue eyes that quickly lift with an easy smile and, just 
as quickly, collapse into sadness. She grew up on the 
eastern edge of New Haven and attended Wilbur Cross 
High School. When she was a child, her mother bal­
anced three jobs.  Luysterborghs has worked all her life, 
too. She raised three sons, one of whom just got out 
of rehab. The youngest drowned in 2011 at the age of 
twenty-one. And even as she faces eviction proceedings, 
she’s been taking care of her two-month-old grandson 
every day. If she is evicted, she will lose her spot in pub­
lic housing. And there’s no other place waiting for her.


“I’m upset about what I’m going through,” Luyster­
borghs says. Through the plate glass windows of China 
King, she can almost make out the white gleam of the 
New Haven County Courthouse, where she’s scheduled 
to appear the next morning. “I’m going through stress, 
I’m going through back pain. I cry.”


For Luysterborghs, the prospect of an eviction is 
frightening, overwhelming, and isolating. But eviction 
has become commonplace for the city’s poorest rent­
ers. The Eviction Lab, a nationwide database of over 
eighty-three million eviction records, estimates that four 
evictions occur in New Haven every day, reflecting the 
pervasiveness of housing instability and poverty on the 
municipal and national levels. And comprehensive solu­
tions may be a long way off.

The eviction process begins with a Notice to Quit Pos­
session, like the one Luysterborghs found on her door. 
Every week, New Haven County State Marshal Brian 
Mezick serves dozens of notices to tenants across the 
city. Eviction papers—most of which stem from nonpay­
ment of rent—launch tenants into a legal process that 
most navigate without an attorney.


Mezick is in his thirties, a clean-shaven man with 
short blonde hair and slight sideburns. He’s been a state 
marshal for the past two years, handling evictions for pri­
vate landlords and the New Haven Housing Authority. 
If a defendant fails to appear in housing court, or loses 
her case, she can be evicted in about four weeks. Other 
times, cases can drag on for many months. If a judge 
upholds an eviction, Mezick oversees the removal pro­
cess.


There’s a certain boyishness about Mezick, who often 
shows up to evictions wearing a brown bomber jacket 
with a sheepskin collar and dark boots. But the state 
marshal ID hanging around his neck betrays the reason 
for his presence on tenants’ doorsteps. “I’m not there to 
be a cowboy, an enforcer, overly hostile. I try to speak 
in calm, low tones,” he says. “I make sure the landlord 
is not on the premises—there’s no need to agitate the 
situation.”


One April morning, at an eviction at a Housing 
Authority apartment near West Rock, Mezick watches as 
the movers work quickly, carrying armfuls of a woman’s 
possessions out the door.


The movers have an easy rapport with him, laughing 
and trading stories about eviction work as they disman­
tle the woman’s home. There was the one with roaches. 
The hoarder. Mezick tells them about a case a few days 
earlier, where a tenant in West Haven barricaded his 
door and threatened to shoot anyone who came in.


“That’s the scary thing. You never know what people 
are going through,” one of the movers says. “We had this 
guy, we’re five minutes from his house, and the road’s 
all blocked off. House is going up in flames. The guy 
had set it on fire and then shot himself.” He pushes a 
few boxes onto a hand truck and wheels it out the door.


During an eviction in New Haven, tenants who can’t 
afford private storage have their possessions packed onto 
a truck that is unloaded at the Department of Public 
Works’ Eviction Warehouse, located in a corner of the 
old Goffe Street Armory. Unlike some other cities, New 
Haven does not charge storage fees, but items that hav­
en’t been retrieved within a month are auctioned off 
wholesale to the public.


Only about a tenth of tenants pick up their posses­
sions, according to warehouse manager Shawn Brown. 
Often, elderly people who have been evicted don’t 
want to tell their families what’s happening, or cannot 
coordinate the pickup. “Sometimes it’s pride, shame, or 
they’ve been sick,” Brown says. She doesn’t like to sell 
people’s items because “some things can’t be replaced.” 
But anything that isn’t claimed goes up for auction.



**Title: A CITY IN CRISIS**
**Page number(s): 24**

New Haven is particularly vulnerable to what 
is increasingly seen as a nationwide eviction 
crisis. The city has a 4.05 percent eviction 
rate, according to the Eviction Lab, meaning 
that roughly four in every one hundred renter 
households are evicted. 


At an auction one morning in April, two men show up 
to bid. Brown leads them through the warehouse, where 
pallets of shrink-wrapped possessions sit in plywood 
bays. The two bidders pass their flashlight beams over 
a pallet piled high with chairs—a translucent iceberg of 
things left behind.


Nothing can be opened before purchase, so bidders 
make their best guesses about the value of the items 
within the boxes and pallets. Anything that doesn’t sell 
at the auction is taken to the Transfer Station in Quin­
nipiac Meadows, New Haven’s landfill.


“Yeah, I’ll take this for ten bucks,” says one of the bid­
ders as he inspects a pallet. He has attended auctions at 
the warehouse every month for a decade. He sells other 
people’s former possessions at local flea markets. “I just 
buy,” he says. “It’s all about the gamble.” By the end of 
the auction, he’s spent $360 on thirty-five pallets, and 
will bring a 26-foot U-Haul to take it all away.


For the bidders, the auction is a chance to hit the 
jackpot on an unassuming pallet: a well-made piece of 
furniture, a box of high-quality electronics, sometimes 
even a stash of money forgotten in the chaos of an evic­
tion. But for tenants, it’s the end of a fast-moving process 
that threatens to strip them of their home and posses­
sions.


New Haven is particularly vulnerable to what is 
increasingly seen as a nationwide eviction crisis. The 
city has a 4.05 percent eviction rate, according to the 
Eviction Lab, meaning that roughly four in every one 
hundred renter households are evicted. In 2016, with 
1,823 cases filed and 1,481 evictions carried out, New 
Haven had the 69th highest rate of eviction for Amer­
ican cities. Of nearby Connecticut cities with simi­
lar populations, Waterbury had a 6.1 percent eviction 
rate—the twenty-second highest in the country—with 
1,437 evictions in 2016. Stamford, with 453 evictions, 
did not make the top 100.


In New Haven, the scars of 1960s-era urban renewal 
remain unhealed. A dilapidated housing stock, high 
housing costs, and entrenched poverty keeps home 
ownership out of reach for most city residents. Accord­
ing to the Partnership for Strong Communities, a Hart­
ford-based affordable housing nonprofit, the median 
income for a New Haven renter household is $28,380, 
and more than half of renters spend 30 percent or more 
of their income on housing. State budget cuts, which 
have depleted resources for eviction-prevention pro­
grams, have further exacerbated the crisis.


New Haven evictions are concentrated in Edgewood, 
Newhallville, Fair Haven, and the Hill, some of the 
city’s poorest neighborhoods, according to Billy Huang, 
a researcher for the New Haven Legal Assistance Associ­
ation (LAA). The eviction crisis in those neighborhoods 
has its roots in their own fraught histories. Beginning in 
the nineteen-thirties, in those predominantly nonwhite 
neighborhoods, families were denied home loans and 
other vital resources through redlining practices. In the 
midcentury era of urban renewal, those areas underwent 
further upheaval through the city’s decision to demolish 
working class neighborhoods designated “slums.”


Evictions are on the public record, so it’s not uncom­
mon for landlords to hold a potential tenant’s history 
against them. A past eviction can be disastrous for low-in­
come tenants attempting to navigate the private housing 
market. And for someone living in public or subsidized 
housing, an eviction can permanently terminate their 
ability to benefit from government housing assistance.


Renee Dineen, a paralegal at LAA, says that landlords 
in New Haven often raise rents to the highest level that 
the Housing Choice Voucher Program (Section 8) or 
the Rental Assistance Program—both federally-subsi­
dized housing support for low-income families—will 
allow, which further disadvantages residents who don’t 
receive housing benefits.


As the eviction crisis in New Haven has grown, so too 
have the obstacles to fighting it. One of the most press­
ing problems is the lack of housing attorneys. Downsiz­
ing in Connecticut legal services and state budget cuts 
have severely restricted the pool of available lawyers. 
Most tenants enter housing court self-represented.


Since the nineteen-nineties, and likely earlier, the 
ratio of landlord-tenant legal representation has been 
roughly eighty to twenty, according to a 1995 Yale Law & 
Policy Review article by Steve Gunn. Today, on average, 
81 percent of landlords in New Haven eviction cases 
have legal representation, compared to 10 percent of 
tenants, according to Billy Huang, the LAA researcher, 
indicating a slight decrease in recent years.


Dineen says that LAA had a seventy-person staff in 
its heyday in the nineteen-seventies. It’s closer to thirty 
today. They used to take walk-in clients, she says, but 
now have to be far more selective about the cases they 
take on. Their housing unit team is just four people.


Many tenants do not even make their Housing Ses­
sion court date, resulting in eviction by default. Amy 
Eppler-Epstein, an attorney at LAA, says that educa-
