Cash bail keeps low income people locked up. In New Haven and Hew York, two organizations are 
fighting against it, with different consequences for their communities. Reporting for this piece was

T
he first thing one notices when walking 
up to the entrance of the Vernon C. Bain Cen­
ter (VBC) in New York City is the fetid smell coming 
from the Fulton Fish Market next door. The road 
leading up to VBC has no sidewalks—just barbed 
wire fences. Queens shimmers across the East River.
Some of the inmates at VBC—known as The Boat, 
since it’s anchored six feet from shore—are serv­
ing short-term sentences, from thirty days to a few 
months, for low-level misdemeanors. The vast major­
ity of its 800 male inmates, however, have landed 
there because they have yet to pay their bail. One of 
these men is a young relative of Jermaine Davis.
A stout, middle-aged Bronx resident, Davis looks 
both exhausted and relieved, like he’s just finished 
a long hike. He has been crisscrossing the city try­
ing to post bail for his relative. “We’ve been back 
and forth for a few days, trying to get him out,” he 
tells me. Davis has been derailed again and again 
by bureaucratic hurdles. First, the Bronx County 
Hall of Justice turned him away because he didn’t 
have a state-issued ID or a pay stub. By the time he 
returned, his family member had already been trans­
ferred to The Boat; Davis was told he could only pay 
there. When I met him at VBC’s bail window, his 
relative had been in jail for four days.
In the United States, people charged with crimes 
are often held in pretrial detention unless they can 
post bail, which is set by a judge. In theory, bail is 
an incentive to appear in court. The fee is returned 
when the trial is concluded, and forfeited if the per­
son charged doesn’t show up. But your experience 
with bail largely depends on whether you’re rich or 
poor. 
When film mogul Harvey Weinstein appeared in 
court this spring to face charges of rape and criminal 
sex acts, he paid his $1 million bail with a cashier’s 
check, and was out of the courtroom within ten min­
utes. In 2010, when sixteen-year-old Kalief Browder 
was charged with stealing a backpack in the Bronx, 
he couldn’t post his $3,000 bail and spent the next 
three years in jail before his charges were dismissed. 
Two years later, he committed suicide.
Bail keeps 450,000 Americans locked up every day 
simply because they’re too poor to pay. Even when 
bail is set as low as $250, it’s often enough to entan­
gle low-income people in the criminal justice system 
for months or years. Cash bail is particularly insidi­
ous. Some forms of bail allow defendants to pay only 
a portion of the total, put up valuable possessions as 
collateral, or cut a deal with a bail bondsman to front 
the bond for them. This is not the case with cash 
bail. When a judge sets cash bail, the defendant must 
pay the full amount out of pocket to be set free. In 
courtrooms across America, cash bail is frequently 
set for minor misdemeanor crimes and even traffic 
violations. Typically, prosecutors push for cash bail, 
the defense pushes against it, and it’s up to the judge 
to decide. Each time cash bail is set too high for the 
accused to pay, someone who is still innocent in the 
eyes of the law is placed in jail.
Even a brief stint behind bars causes significant 
collateral damage. People like Davis’ relative lose 
access to family and employment, and often expe­
rience emotional and physical trauma. “The whole 
process is insane,” Davis said. “It creates a huge 
strain on the family.”
Being Black or Latino increases the odds of being 
one of those 450,000 people. According to the Pre­
trial Justice Institute, courts saddle Black men with 
thirty-five percent higher bail amounts than white 
counterparts charged with the same crime and with 
similar criminal histories. For Hispanic men, that fig­
ure is nineteen percent. 
And serving time in jail pretrial drastically 
increases a person’s conviction rate. It makes it three 
to four times more likely that one will serve a prison 
or jail sentence after trial, and such sentences are, on 
average, two to three times longer, according to the 
Pretrial Justice Institute. Often, defendants choose to 
take a guilty plea; they are able to leave jail that day 
but are forced to carry a criminal record for the rest 
of their lives, making it considerably more challeng­
ing to get a job or earn a degree.
Jermaine Davis’ close-knit family can pick up 
the slack when one of them is incarcerated. And he 
has a job, at an employment training and addiction 
recovery center, which allows him to take time off to 
resolve his relative’s case. Most importantly, he has 
the money to do so. Most of the 450,000 don’t have 
people like Davis on their side.
In recent years, the cash bail epidemic has trig­
gered a national movement. Nonprofit bail funds, 
financed almost entirely by private donations, have 
opened up from Tulsa to St. Louis, and Detroit to 
New York, posting bail for those who can’t afford it 
themselves. Their clients include people like Davis’ 
relative, awaiting freedom in the belly of the Boat. 
Two years ago, New Haven joined the map with the 
Connecticut Bail Fund—an organization taking a 
radical, intimate approach to bail reform.
During the summer of 2017, I worked at the Bronx 
Freedom Fund, a non-profit bail fund serving the 
South Bronx. The team at BFF also founded The 
Bail Project, an umbrella organization that plans to 
open 40 bail funds across the nation and bail out 
over 160,000 people by 2022. This summer, I trav­
eled back to the Freedom Fund to understand the 
genesis of this national movement, and then to Con­
necticut Bail Fund’s offices in New Haven, where, 
I soon learned, organizers are viewing bail in an 
entirely new light, with very different stakes for the 
community.
The Freedom Fund’s office, a collection of cubi­
cles on the sixth floor of the Bronx County Hall of 
Justice, sports a panoramic view of the South Bronx 
through floor-to-ceiling windows. The organization’s 
vision is equally expansive: It’s trying to liberate the 
borough.
When the organization began in 2016, it had a 
single employee quietly operating in a corner of the 
office of the Bronx Defenders, just down the street 
from the Hall. With the Defenders’ fundraising con­
nections and large community of legal advocates 
to support them, the Freedom Fund has rapidly 
expanded in the last two years. They’ve hired nine 
more employees, opened a branch in Queens, and 
posted bail for 2,020 Bronx residents. 
 Donations to the BFF are pouring in. When I last 
visited, their director was giving a tour to the niece of a 
donor who’d just written a $100 thousand check. They 
now can take on almost every client who qualifies. 
Outside the offices of the Freedom Fund, the mar­
ble hallways of the Hall of Justice echo with the anx­
ious murmurs of those whose day in court has come. 
Lawyers confer with clients in hushed corners; defen­
dants fidget, waiting to be called; through the heavy 
doors, a judge presides over a cherry-paneled court­
room.
 Each day, the organization receives several referrals 
from public defenders representing clients who can’t 
afford bail. Usually, a referral comes after a client has 
been arraigned, but before they are transferred to jail. 
When a client is approved for payment, a Freedom
