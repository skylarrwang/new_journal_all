Makes a Family, born-digital archives reveal sentiments 
in more detail than physical archives likely would. 
Caldera is one of four members of the Born Digi­
tal Working Group at Yale, created in January 2015 to 
devise guidelines and assemble resources for born-dig­
ital archives. “We want to make sure the libraries are 
able to store digital materials as well as we store all 
our other materials,” she said. One of the resources 
the group has incorporated is the Digital Accessioning 
Service, a collection of technological equipment used 
to redact personal information like Social Security and 
bank account numbers, scan for viruses, and capture 
files from digital media.

But employing high-tech preservation methods is 
not the only challenge the group faces. It must deal 
with issues when its forensic toolkit interferes with 
donors’ rights to privacy. To learn more about these 
ethical quandaries, I met with the Beinecke Library’s 
digital archivist Gabby Redwine at 344 Winchester 
Avenue, a long, sweeping building with lofty glass win­
dows, home to the Beinecke’s back-end technological 
services. Redwine is the first person at Yale whose job is 
entirely dedicated to born-digital archives. “One of the 
main issues that comes up is intentionality,” Redwine 
explained. “What sets born-digital apart from physical 
archives is that we can capture information from digital 
media that hasn’t been overwritten.” 

Redwine explained that when users drag their files 
into the trash bin, most think those files are beyond 
recovery. But really, the computer only deletes the 
file “pointer”—a roadmap that leads the computer to 
the file—while still keeping the file itself. This means 
when Redwine and her colleagues receive a hard drive, 
they can use the Beinecke’s forensic tools—which, she 
noted, are the same tools the FBI uses—to uncover 
mounds of deleted files that the donor may not have 
intended to hand over. When archivists work with 
materials from well-known cultural icons like Vogel or 
Bernstein, deleted files are a gold mine of novel drafts, 
essay fragments, and browsing histories. But, until 
they receive consent from the donor, they must follow 
library policy, abstaining from opening those gigabytes 
of potentially valuable but sensitive information.

The available born-digital archives are enough to 
give us a glimpse into the private lives of all sorts of 
people, from authors to activists to everyday citizens. 
Often, the most colloquial exchanges are the most 
striking. On October 10, 2008, more than one-and-a-
half years after Heller’s testimony, Buckheit received 
an email from Laurel Hoskins, a friend of Love Makes 
a Family, about a Connecticut Supreme Court ruling:
“I KNOW you are NOT sitting around your com­
puter right now because the decision JUST came down 
and Stephen and I are just THRILLED and you must 
be over the top! 4 to 3 decision is good enough. So what 
if all our money is in the toilet—start planning your 
weddings!”
