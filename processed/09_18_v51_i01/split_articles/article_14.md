of ‘wouldn’t it be so nice and new,’” said former member 
Anna Piwowar, who graduated this spring. “To Sphincter, it’s 
not. This is our lived experience of writing sketches. It’s hard 
for me to imagine what it would be like in a room where 
that’s not the case.”
In Sphincter rehearsals, every suggestion is applauded; 
no idea is shot down. “We’re not writing for the intention of 
being funny to everyone. We write to the intention of what 
we believe in,” said member Yuni Chang, who graduated in 
May. Members still joke about a Bulldog Days Show where 
they performed a sketch about hypermasculine culture at 
Goldman Sachs and another about a woman getting eggs 
sucked out of her uterus—to radio silence from the audience.
More than half of Sphincter’s line-up is made up of 
women of color. But improviser Lillian Ekem, a member 
of Purple Crayon who participated in Disast-Her, expressed 
some concerns about the showcase’s lack of racial diversity. 
“As a woman of color going to these rehearsals of improv, it’s 
been mostly white,” she said. “At a place where I’m supposed 
to feel part of the majority, I’m still a minority.” 
Ervolino and Prendergast are aware of that the spaces 
Question, said this is a common phenomenon. “‘That’s not 
a phone, it’s a banana.’ The person who says that is a man in 
my mind,” she said.
Sometimes audiences only reinforce this dilemma, 
according to Ervolino. She came up with a theory about what 
she calls ‘the frat boy laugh.’ “When a joke ‘goes well’, we’re 
listening to the loudest people laughing,” she said. And, 
according to Ervolino, men are often the loudest laughers. 
When an audience is dominated by male laughter, a joke at 
men’s expense might not go over well. In one case at a Just 
Add Water improv show last semester, a group of men in the 
audience audibly live commented the show, pointing out the 
women they found unfunny or unattractive.
In a sign of progress in Yale’s comedy scene, women’s 
leadership of comedy groups has been on the rise. Last year, 
four of the five mixed-gender sketch groups on campus—
Red Hot Poker, Fifth Humour, The Good Show, and Odd 
Ducks—were directed by women, along with four of the five 
improv groups. 
On a Wednesday evening in April, five female comedy 
directors trickled into a room in the Center for Teaching and 
Learning. They greeted each other with warm smiles and 
generous laughter. And as our conversation about director­
ship warmed up, they nodded eagerly at their shared expe­
riences.
“I’ve never seen a message in the GroupMe from a woman 
asking what time or where rehearsal is,” said Emma Chanen, 
director of the Good Show. “The men struggle to consult 
resources and make it happen for themselves.”
Raffi Donatich, then director of Red Hot Poker, jumped 
in: “Literally last semester, one member of my group––whom 
I love––goes, ‘When is the show?’ and I’m like, ‘Tonight! In 
hours!’ We’d been rehearsing all week!” As they laugh, it’s 
clear this is all too familiar.
“It’s hard because I’m so bad at logistics,” Tessa Palter-Pos­
ton, director of improv group Purple Crayon, confesses. “But 
at least I have frequent shame about it.”
Then, there’s the question of how women should go about 
leading in majority-male spaces. Chanen again: “I take up 
a f***-ton of space in Good Show. I’m unapologetic about 
that. They’re welcome for the feedback.” However, when she 
finds that members of her group have been talking over her 
for ten minutes straight, “I wonder if that would be the same 
if I were a man.” Hums of agreement emerge from the other 
directors.
Donatich also noted that the family culture of Yale com­
edy groups led to ‘mommification’, a term for when women 
directors are treated as maternal figures rather than leaders. 
Outside the meeting, Ervolino voiced concerns with how 
men and women handle sensitive material. The burden of 
initiating discourse often falls on women.
“When anything is available to be made into a joke, there 
are a lot of opportunities to mess up,” Ervolino said. “It’s hard 
to be the only one bothered [by insensitivity]. Just because 
a space is comfortable and everyone is close doesn’t mean 
that certain things are allowed.” As rush season began this 
fall, Ervolino asked to withdraw a sketch about gay women, 
written by a straight man, that she felt could alienate the 
audience and prospective members. She also started con­
versations on ensuring women get funny parts on stage and 
using gender-neutral character names.
For a non-male group like Sphincter, these types of prob­
lems are rarer. “The language [of Disast-Her] had an element

they’ve cultivated still reflect issues of representation within 
the comedy scene. “It’s a very white group of women. That’s 
something about comedy in general and comedy at Yale,” 
Ervolino said. Similarly, despite their efforts at inclusivity, 
neither event has hosted a non-binary or trans performer. “It’s 
weird to know that this is already a failure, in some aspects,” 
Ervolino said. But, she added, a more inclusive comedy 
scene “needs to start somewhere.”
THE SHOWCASE
The night of Disast-Her, LC101 was packed to the brim. 
The line outside snaked to the basement toilets. Audience 
members cheered performers’ names before the show had 
even started. Backstage, Ervolino anxiously paced between 
rooms. Improvisers were warming up, sketch performers 
were fine-tuning, and the stand-up comics sat in the audi­
ence, nervously reviewing their sets. But once Ervolino sat 
down to watch, her anxieties dissipated. “The whole point 
of the showcase was that these women knew what they were 
doing,” she said.
At the warm-up, even the woman house manager joined 
in. Much like at the very first meeting, no one introduced 
themselves by what group they were in. Performers from 
each group shared their respective warm-up rituals, some­
thing comedians at Yale are often fiercely secretive about. 
But not tonight. These performers were part of a community. 
Just before the improvisers took to the stage, a growing 
ruckus echoed from the corridors of LC. It was one word 
being repeated over and over again: “Women. Women! 
Women! WOMEN!” As they ran out onto the stage, the 
crowd roared, then sat back to listen.
