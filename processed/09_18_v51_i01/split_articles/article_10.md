“Can you imagine what it might be like for a child whose parents are not allowed to be married?”

The day was March 26, 2007. Anna Heller, a 39-year-old social worker from Willimantic, Connecticut, tes­tified during a twelve-hour hearing before the Con­necticut legislature on H.B. 7395, which would grant same-sex couples in the state the right to marriage. She spoke on behalf of Love Makes a Family, an organiza­tion that lobbied for the bill. 

Heller’s testimony, and the rest Love Makes a Fam­ily’s records, are now housed at Yale Manuscripts and Archives, in the northeast wing of Sterling Memorial Library. More than sixteen miles of pages line the walls of the main reading room. But the Love Makes a Fam­ily archives aren’t found in the bound books lining the walls or folders stashed in the Library Shelving Facility; they sit in two desktop computers sitting patiently in the far-right corner, waiting to be dusted off and started up. “That’s where you’ll be working today,” the librar­ian at the reference desk said to me, gesturing towards the corner. 

After spending an hour skimming through dinner party planning correspondences by Love Makes a Fami­ly’s associate director, Carol Buckheit, I stumbled upon an email exchange in which she sent a copy of Hell­er’s testimony to a professional writer, Alison Cashin. I double-clicked on the Word document, waiting for the software to boot up. But what appeared was not a wall of black text; it was a red sheet full of cross-outs and underlines that covered the original draft like a heavy blanket.

To professional archivists, emails and Word doc­uments are more than lines of text on a computer screen; they are “born-digital” archives, materials cre­ated and preserved in a digital form—including audio recordings, floppy disks, digital musical scores, and entire hard drives and laptops. Two decades ago, Yale’s archives were limited to physical objects like books and manuscripts. Now, Yale owns the virtual records of contemporary public figures ranging from playwright Paula Vogel’s teaching files to poet Charles Bernstein’s academic emails. Archivists are becoming more inter­ested in born-digital materials, which often reveal cru­cial information missing from physical materials. This was certainly the case in Buckheit and Cashin’s emails:
Buckheit: Can I ask your wise counsel on one ques­tion on the attached? I’m afraid some of this reinforces that gays should not have kids because we are hurting them emotionally—what do you think?
Cashin: Oof. You’re totally right, Carol. As a rule, I try to avoid anything that can be seen as reinforcing stereotypes—this totally does that…we are trying to emphasize the messages that correspond to other testifiers’ messages. 

Buckheit and Cashin’s goal was simple: to frame Heller’s story in a more loving light, replacing phrases like “I wish I did not have to spend my adolescence in fear” with “I feel blessed with my mom’s love and support throughout my childhood.” Heller’s testimony was not a spontaneous release of emotions but a careful construction, crafted and approved by the organization to optimize Heller’s two short minutes in front of the judiciary committee.

The week before my library visit, I met with Mary Caldera, the head of arrangement and description at Manuscripts and Archives. She works with the archives of historically excluded groups, including ethnic minorities and LGBTQ communities. “A lot of the little off-hand correspondences used to be more formal,” Caldera said. “But now, most people have these phone conversations or write quick emails, which can be very informal and reveal a lot more about what they really mean.” By combing through essay drafts and brief emails, archivists uncover the author’s thought process. And because electronic material is often seen as dispos­able, born-digital archives serve as a repository for an author’s most private musings. For the testifiers of Love In Yale’s archives, digital records provide a new portal to the past.
