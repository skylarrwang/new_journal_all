' 
if it were kicking you in the ass," may have 
already tipped the balance (62% voted for 
gay, 31 °/o for bisexual, and 7°/o for straight). 
The pilot's plot gets underway· when 
Snow notices a mysterious necklace hang-
-ing over the edge of a brick wall. She grabs 
it, proceeds to a deserted area 
bathed in 
,moonlight, of course 
perches on a 
bench in her flimsy, white shift, and fingers 
the jewelry while nervously glancing over 
.her shoulder. Inexplicably, she is then kid-
napped. The necklace belongs to a secret 
society called 'VJ'he Gentlemen," whose 
dark, brooding leader, Christian, has 
organized the kidnapping to recover it-
and maybe something more. "I'll pick her 
up at midnight," he orders a goon over the 
· phone. "No, of course she doesn't know 
~e. And," he adds, his voice dropping a 
.register, "I want her back in an even better 
} 
A:ondition than you took her.'

in ~~~ck-s:" she . suggests thoughtfully. 
"Snow could be up there, with pigtails, a 
April2006 
basket of books, a sundress. And then one 
of the bad guys could find her, like Diesel, 
and he'd say," -she lowers her voice-"Snow-
come here." She also has a plan for how 
Stephanie and Snow should resolve their 
backstabbing friendship: "I was like, 'why 
don't I make out with Ashley'? And they 
were like, 'but she's a girl!' And I was like-
'so?' I want to un-build gender stereotypes 
at Yale; it'd be so progressive." Chen, hop-
ing to attract a male audience with a sci-
ence-fiction 
angle, 
is 
giving 
"The 
Gentlemen" ties to a race of "demonic 
creatures from hell." It is Merriman, how-
ever, who may have more of the right idea. 
The most impressive element of the 
show is its endless roll of credits. Though 
Chen conceptualized lf!YU on her own, she 
relied on more than forty-five people to 
bring it to fruition. "Ijna Chen is unbeliev-
able," explains Suzanna Lee '08, head of 
pro 
· g at YTV "It takes so much 
time and effort to put together something 
like the vision she had for lf!YU. This was a 
two year process of 
it happen." 
Two years for fifteen minutes? ''People are 
so ready to criticize everything and anything 
on YTv," Suzanna continues, "but jhey 
have no idea what goes into it 
the equip-
ment, schedules, learning how to use the 
equipment . often for the very first time." 
Why do students who are self-pro-
claimed "bad-TV" junkies ridicule Yale's 
own network? YIV is not, and net.er will 
be, MTV: it's an amateur-run college TV 
channel. This translates, as we all immedi-
ately note, into the home video q4ty of 
its shows. But, more importantly, it also 
allows for enormous creative opportuni-
ties: ''We could go right now, and I could 
put you live on the air," Suzanna says. 
So if you have an idea for a show, 
YTV can help make it a reality. If you 
don't, perhaps you should abandon yoUr 
pretensions and sit back to enjoy' another 
example of Yalies working hard at 
~· 
art. Of course, in this case, the art is set to 
an '80s soundtrack, with a few close-up 
shots and a handful of love triangles 
thrown in for good measure.
