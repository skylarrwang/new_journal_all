'As a former advisor to the spe-
cial court in Sierra Leone Johnson
has confidence in the project's util-
ity. ccThe tyrants of today are in the
prisoner's dock down the road,"
she said, predicting possible future
uses of the Center's research.
When power finally does change
hands in Iran, a new government
might call for an invc;stigation of
past abuses. And while lawyers like
Piss tend to doubt that an Iranian
court or international commission
there would accept an outside orga-
nization's work, it rnight be useful
to those gathering official evidence.

you do today is going to end up,"
Johnson mused.

WORKING GROUP
This group is -aimed at fostering a
university-wide dialogue on the relation-
ships between scientific findings and the
religious quest, with a particular empha-
sis on the neurosciences and their impact
on questions of theology, ethics, and
belief. The group also sponsors presen-
tations by leading scientists, theologians,
and ethicists from Yale and elsewhere,
and will develop group-authored publica-
tions. A professional science background
is not required. Undergraduates, gradu-
ates, faculty, and the academically
engaged public are invited
Facilitated by Nihal de Lanerolle, Professor of
Neurosurgery and Neurobiology and Chaplain of
-the Episcopal Church at Yale.
A grant from the Metanexus Institute's LocalS ocieties
Initiative funds this program.

**Harmony Place**

abor Kovacs left Hungary in 1976. "Draft dodg-
ing," he explains with a faint smile. "In Hungary,
everybody had to serve. You didn't have a choice."
It is a quiet Tuesday evening at .the Trinity Lutheran
Church on ·wall Street. Gabor sits at a table in a room at.
.
the back of the chapel. He occasionally looks over at the
window as the daylight fades. It is almost six o'clock.
Harmony Place, a community center for the homeless
run by Yale student volunteers, meets here every Tuesday
and Thursday from 4 to 10 p.m., and Sundays from 7:30
a.m. to 6 p.m. Around us, some of the other guests wait in
line to use the phone; some quietly play cards; others sit in
folding chairs watching a movie on an old television in the
corner.
''You know," Gabor continues, "that's the way it was in
Hungary. It was· a big mess. They were a shell-shocked peo-
ple. First it was the Hapsburgs, then it was the SS, then it
was the Communists ... In World War II, you had to fight.
And if you fought, you died, but if you didn't, you were
mowed down by your own. Even afterwards, when every-

"Industry, politicians. You can't trust them. They lie:-
all of them. And they're ineffective. Do you know they put
nail polish remover in milk? They do. And the government
does nothing. Why do you think the rate of birth defects
has doubled in the last ten years? Chemicals~ Everywhere."
He goes on, listing government conspiracies and the
abuses of the industrial age: the poison in fapd, the fatal
flaws in medication, the rising cancer rates. ::;
Jim, another guest, leans back in his chair on the other
side of the table. He looks over his shoulder at the crowd
in front of the Tv. "They're probably watching Lethal
Weapon Twelve, or something stupid like that," he says in his
soft-spoken tone. "I'd watch movies, but not this garbage.
I hate this stuff. But try putting in Schindler's List or some-
thing and see what these guys do."
Unlike Gabor, Jim grew up just one town over, in
Hamden. He comes from a strict Pentecostal family. He
has deep, intelligent eyes
which are usually fixed on the
floor, and a wide, emphatic smile which he seldom shows.
He is well spoken, but usually sits silently apart. Only when

tall and slim,

the Saybrook dining hall. Joe is always
quick with a stnile, though he is miss-

from the homeless life. There is a

meals on Sunday. It also fosters a cer-

Harmony Place was founded in
1999 by the acting Yale Homelessness
Hunger Action Project coordinator
John Scafidi '01
and volunteer
Gregory Duff Morton '00. It sprang
from Outreach
another community
service organization founded by
Morton to encourage undergraduate
involvement beyond campus. First
housed in Fellowship House on Elm
Street, it moved to Trinity in 2001.
For a while, it worked. There were
weekly meetings between volunteers
and homeless patrons to set agendas,

as well as boards for conflict resolu-
tion, rules, and a constant supply of
drivers to and from the shelters. There
were protocols, organization, and, it
seemed, a plan for the future.
In recent years, however, the num-
ber of volunteers has decreased dra-
matically. The only cornmunity volun-
teer is Frank Dean, who is often the
only person there to ensure that the
center opens.
Dean has kept every volunteer sign-in
book used at Harmony Place. His
long, stern face remains set and
expressionless as he glances through
their pages. "There used to be a lot
