year, the IHRDC received one mil-
lion dollars in funding from the 
U.S. State Department, nearly a 
third of the $3.5 million earmarked 
for democracy promotion in Iran. 
The Center, which is forthright 
in its aims (witness the frankness of 
its name), reveals on its website 
that it is interested in documenting 
human rights abuses in Iran solely 
since the Islamic revolution of 
1979 ushered the current, staunch-
ly 
anti-American 
regime 
into 
power. It's no surprise, then, that 
some Yale students and faculty 
members reacted with suspicion to 
news of the Center's opening in 
December 2004. They worried that 
the Center would merely concern 
itself with building a case for U.S. 
military intervention in Iran. 
Opposition to the government 
in Tehran, after all, is a growth 
industry. In February, Condoleeza 
Rice 
announced 
the 
Bush 
Administration's 
intention 
to 
expand funding for Iranian democ-
ratization from its paltry $3.5 mil-
lion allotment in 2005 to $75 mil-
lion this year. With so much money 
in the budget, strange things might 
happen: A new cadre of Iranian 
freedom fighters might emerge 
overnight; Dick Cheney might 
begin professing grave concern for 
Middle Easterners' rights and safe-
ty; and an Iranian version of 
Ahmad Chalabi 
the exiled Iraqi 
expatriate who famously fed politi-
cians and journalists information 
to support the invasion of his 
homeland 
might set up shop right 
across the Green, here in the heart 
of sunny New Haven. 


As it happens, few if any of 
those events have come to pass. 
The IHRDC's founders claim that 
their timing, like the Center's loca-
tion, was a fortunate coincidence: 
The 
three 
Iranian-American 
founders 
Drs. Ramin Ahmandi, 
Payam 
Akhavan, 
and 
Roya 
Boroumand 
met in New Haven in 
2003 and hatched the idea for the 
Center soon after. Their one mil-
lion dollar grant came in 2004 from 
the State Department's Human 
Rights 
Democracy Fund, 
which distributed over $48 million 
last year and cites the entire 
"Muslim world" as a regional prior-
ity. 
According 
co-founder 
Akhavan, the support they have 
received only demonstrates that 
not everyone in the U.S. govern-
ment is in favor of overt regime 
change in Iran. It was the more 
"progressive elements" of a diverse 
State Department, he posits, that 
opted to back the Center's peace-
able project. 
Like the IHRDC's other sup-
porters, Akhavan is adamant that 
those who scrutinize the present 
Iranian government's human rights 
record are not all seeking to justify 
an invasive foreign policy, and that 
some may wish to document its 
abuses for entirely different rea-
sons, 
which 
they 
claim, 
are 
divorced from politics. "When 
there are strong interests at play, 
human rights often become instru-
mentalized for questionable ends," 
Akhavan acknowledged. The prob-
lem is not "that no one is speaking 
about human rights in Iran. The 
question is: 'Is there really a gen-
uine commitment?' And: 'Is there 
really an appreciation that a culture 
of human rights is not just about 
regime change?"' 
To overcome the murmurs of 
skeptical Yale liberals, the Center 
will need to show that any similari-
ty between its agenda and that of 
the Bush administration is purely 
coincidental. Once it does that, the 
real work can begin. 


Two types of organizations 
are already at work docu-
menting 
human 
rights 
abuses in the Islamic Republic. 
First, there are the behemoth, well-
established monitors like Amnesty 
International and Human Rights 
Watch that research and publicize 
human rights abuses in countries 
around the 
world, including Iran. 
At the other end of the spectrum, 
there are the hundreds of websites, 
blogs, and smaller organizations 
devoted to denouncing the Iranian 
government, including one started 
by 
IHRDC 
Boroumand in 2001. For the first 
sort, objectivity is the key to estab-
lishing credibility. Organizations of 
the latter type, however, make no 
claims of neutrality. The IHRDC 
appears destined to keep a foot in 
each camp. Though its board is 
staffed with well-known human 
rights experts, it also plans to rely 
on testimony from the four-million-strong Iranian-American dias-
pora to gather and disseminate 
information-including 
accounts 
from exiles who make no bones 
about their opposition to the 
Iranian government. 
Yet what really makes the New 
Haven Center unique, according to 
Executive Director Mora Johnson, 
is its narrow focus and legal and 
historical 
expertise. The Center 
employs two Iranian historians, as 
well as a handful of lawyers who 
specialize in human rights. Their 
goal is to collect documents and 
testimony from existing sources 
and then to compile reports with a 
level of detail that broader organi-
zations do not have time to include 
in theirs. The detailed reports-
and the material on which they are 
based 
will be published in both 
English and Farsi and eventually 
made available on a searchable 
archives to aid policymakers, jour-
nalists, scholars, and students, both 
in Iran and abroad. 
The Center's goal is abstract, 
and its success so far is difficult to 
gauge. The first reports, due to be 
published between May and July, 
range in topic from the treatment 
of Iran's Baha'i population in the 
1980s to the recent death of 
Iranian-Canadian journalist Zahra 
Kazemi while in police custody in 
Tehran. These are not novel sub-
jects. But to the Chair of the 
Center's Board of Directors, Yale 
Law Professor Owen Fiss, that is 
exactly the point: The reports will 
take a fresh look at old debates. 
Evidence of state repression of the 
Baha'i, for example, was gleaned 
from extensive Baha'i archives in 
Tel Aviv. Long available but never 
closely examined, the information 
should give form and substance to 
long-held suspicions. From these 
documents, Fiss explained, "We 
could see this wasn't just vengeance 
but a systematic policy to extermi-
nate or repress the Baha'i ... All the 
world has known it is uncomfortable 
for Baha'i in Iran, but this evi-
dence is really chilling." 
Fiss added that the difference 
between those two levels of under-
standing is more than semantic. 
Many of the worst state-sponsored 
crimes of the last century only 
came to light after the fall of the 
governments 
that 
perpetrated 
them. By that time, observers and 
politicians around the world could 
safely throw up their hands and 
claim to have never suspected how 
egregious 
offenders 
really 
were-and thus did not recognize 
how strongly they ought to have 
been condemned. Now, in Iran's 
case, Professor Piss hopes, "That 
excuse will no longer be available." 


On the surface, Iran seems 
the last country in need of 
this 
added 
degree 
of 
scrutiny. 
government 
in 
Tehran has one of the most harsh-
ly criticized human rights records 
in the world. The country was put 
under one of the most far-reaching 
sanctions in U.S. history in 1996, 
and President Bush has singled it 
out for censure in every State of 
the Union address since 2002. In 
December, the United Nations 
General Assembly passed a resolution condemning Iran's continued 
human rights violations, from the 
nation's 
use of torture to public 
executions and lack of due legal 
process. 
Yet the IHRDC is not the lone 
voice calling for a more thorough 
inspection of the country. History 
Professor and Iran specialist Abbas 
Amanat 
who is not affiliated with 
the Center 
agrees: "Although it 
has been done somewhat unprofes-
sionally by others," he said recently, 
"it has never been done by people 
who really know what they're 
doing."
