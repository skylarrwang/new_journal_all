Pawluk hopes to reVitalize his urban congregation. 
then never again. ''Y alies are always 
busy. I don't think they're as interested 
any more." The original leadership of 
Harmony Place has long since gradu-
ated, and the spirit that inspired its 
founding has dissipated in successive 
generations of volunteers. 

As volunteers left, Harmony Place 
began to run more and more on iner-
tia; the agendas, grievance boards, and 
activities slackened. Fights 
both 
verbal and physical 
have become 
more frequent. 

"I don't like that the guests bring 
their stuff in from outside," says Jim. 
''It's called Harmony Place. I don't 
feel any harmony here anymore." He 
remains pensive for a moment. "Part 
of me thinks it sucks that Harmony 
Place is moving out~ but part of me 
thinks it's good. People fight, they 
steal from here, they try to sleep in 
here ... " He pauses and looks around 
and, in a subdued tone of disgust, 
continues. "People have had sex in 
this fuckin' place. That's not right. 
That's disgraceful. There used to be a 
corrununity, but there is no longer." 

''But," Jim continues, "on the 
other hand, it is gonna suck. There 
won't be a place to come in out of the 
heat. And the laundry 
nowhere to 
do your laundry. And the winter," he 
says, raising his eyes. ''And the win-
ter ... we didn't have a real winter this 
year, ~ut wel have one next year. That

be hard." 

hen Harmony Place first 
came to Trinity, it encoun-
tered a 
very different 
parish from the one it is about to be 
evicted from. 

''We were on the verge of closing 
down," says Pastor Henry Pawluk. He 
is tall, with wire-ritn glasses, a thin 
goatee, and neat brown hair. His 
office is an orderly Orange Street 
aparttnent adjoining the church. · A 
cross hangs on the wall and a stand 
crowned with a religious painting 
props open the door. 

"I know it doesn't look like it frorn 
the size of the building, but our con-
gregation had shrunk dramatically. 
We were living off our endowment." 

Trinity had been between pastors 
for several months, and the month 
before Pastor Pawluk arrived, church 
president Jack Nicholson had unilat-
erally approved Harmony Place's use 
of the building's facilities. 

"Jack never did what should be 
done before making a decision like 
that," says Pawluk. "He never con-
sulted the congregation, he never 
tried to integrate Harmony Place into 
the community. From the start, it was 
unpopular with some of the congre-
gation." 

"But," he adds, "I thought it was 
an excellent idea. I thought urban 
ministry was the key to the church's 
survival." 

Founded in 1865 by working-class 
German irnmigrants, mempership in 
Trinity Lutheran peaked in the 1950s 
with a largely blue-collar congrega-
tion hovering above two thousand. In 
2001, Pawluk a~ved -on the heels of 
three decades' worth of rising crime 
rates and vanishing manufacturing 
jobs. The congregation had dwindled 
to fewer than two hundred, with a 
weekly attendance of around 45. 

"Urban churches are in decline . 
Not · just here, everywhere. Saint 
Boniface, the Catholic church down 
the street" 
Pawluk indicates with a 
wave of his hand 
"was forced to 
close last year. Thirty one churches in 
New York alone shut their doors last 
year. They just don't have the congre-
gations." 

''You know," Pawluk continues, 
carefully 
phrasing his 
thoughts, 
"There has always been a resistance 
to a religious presence in Harmony 
Place. Students tend to be secular'--
and I understand that. But there are 
some in the congregation who feel 
that Harmony Place does not care 
whether the church lives or dies." 

"Over the last five years, three days 
a week, five hours a day, we have 
given Harmony Place water, free heat, 
chairs, room space, kitchen access,-
all for free. 'I know it's easy for stu-
dents and non-church people to look 
at the church and say that we're not 
doing enough. But when Harmony

Sundays 
now we're open every day, 
for at least half the day. We'~e adding 
new programs, and," he smiles, ufor 
the first tirne in many years we're 
· 
to see people return to the 
church." 

Indeed, since Pastor Pawluk 
arrived, Trinity's weekly attendance 
has more than doubled to one hun-
dred per week. New groups.-
N arcotics A.nonymous, Alcoholics 
Anonymous, church youth groups-
, 
have formed, all vying for· space. As 
the church has expanded, tensions 
·with Harmony Place due to fights, 
thefts, break-ins, and disorder on the 
part .of the homeless have become 
J

increasingly serious.

.c-

dontrwaidi out for ourselves, we'll be 
gone in five to ten years. Whether you 
are religious. or not, you lose some-
thing in a cornntunity when a church 
closes. It's the center, it's the con-
science. Church-bashing has become 
very popular in the last few years," he 
says, "but we're the ones still in 
the city." 

f there is any future for 
Harmony Place, it lies with the 
current 
coordinator, 
Yale 
freshrnan Sarah Marks. "The more I 
work with Harmony Place," she 
wrote in an e-ntail, "the more I an1 
shocked that it has survived as long 
as it has. It involves a very complex 
April2006 
set of dynamics." . 

Marks recognizes the challenge of 
supplying a community center for 
such a volatile group of people: . 
Balancing the needs of the homeless 
with the sensibility of the communi-
ty at large requires · delicacy. For the 
short term, her goal is simple: keep 
Harmony Place alive by any means 
possible. Marks is looking to various 
churches and conununity groups for 
a new location. She tries to keep spir-
its !-JP, encourage volunteers, provide 
entertainment, and keep the program 
functioning. 

"We have a very committed core 
group," she says, ccbut l think in. the 
future we need to take more care 
with recruiting." She hopes to start a 
formal intern program through 
Dwight Hall, find grant funding, and 
maybe even locate a permanent 
home . 

But change comes slowly. The 
volunteers are few, the churches hes-
itant, and the great structural 
changes she envisions remain far of£ 
As of yet, Harmony Place has 
nowhere to go when it is displaced in 
June. No one has stepped forward to

zves or 
cSee that?" he says, frustrated. 
"My parishioners get towed when 
they come to worship. How can you 
grow a congregation when more 
than half of them come in from the 
suburbs, and they have nowhere to 
park?" 

His concern for his flock shows 
on his face. Pastor Pawluk takes no 
joy in turning out Harmony Place-
that is clear. In fact, he seems pained 
by the decision. But on the back 
steps of his of~ce, he is looking for-
ward to a new and thriving urban 
church 
and to an extent, I can feel 
his enthusiasm. Like the student vol-
unteers who forgot 
day-to-day, 
month-to-month, year-to-year 
the 
little room in the back of the church 
they once visited, he, too, has his 
own future and his own corrununity 
to think of. 

I cannot help but look across the 
same alley at the back door of the 
church and the stairs leading up to 
the room which, in several hours, 
will fill with New Haven's home-
less 
the "shell-shocked," as Gabor 
might coin them. And, as Pastor 
Pawluk closes the door behind me, I 
arm on 
en 
think of something Frank had said: 
offer a home. Even the a cappella and 
improv groups Sarah has contacted 
to perform at Harrnony Place have 
not responded. Nobody, it seems, is 
certain of Harmony Place's future. 

cWhen we clean up, after we're 
done here, they want it spodess. 
They even want you to sweep up 
your footprints. They want it to look 
like you were never here." 

s Pastor Pawluk leaves his 
office, he pauses on the 
wrought iron stait way and 
looks out. He points to the 
parking lot.

episode ... " I paused, searching for 
a tactful phrase. 

"Kind of sucked?" offered I jna Chen 
- ~08~ the mastermind behind lf!YU, the 
undergraduate soap opera that recently 
premiered on YTY, Yale's student-run tel-
evision station. . 

'Well,' I thought, 'now that you mention 
it,_.)eah.' 

.I JvyU captured attention on campus 
._ lorig before it premiered. Chen's mar-
keting team handed out laminated cards 
at Co.mnlOris Dining Hall, placed ads in 
\ 
the campus tabloid, Rumpus, and plas-
tei-e~ every campus bulletin board with 
posterS. Each offered seductively few 
details; "lt:JU ... Soon." The show man-
aged to achieve that magical something 
as yet unheard of for YTV: serious 
buzz. And it paid off. On the day lf!YU 
premiered, 847 people went to the 
show's website, www.chooseyourscan-
dal.com, to download the episode. 

Unfortunately, the show fails to live 
. . 
Yale, and I was like, 'I can do this myself."' 

After each episode, viewers log online to 
vote on questions like, "Should Snow and 
Christian make out in Episode Two?" The 
results are then incorporated into the next 
episode (64°/o percent said "yes, they 
should"). As Chen has realized, there is no 
better way for viewers to sate their God 
complexes than by commanding charac-
ters to make out on camera and then

'09. And, frorri now on, each episode will 
focus on only half of the cast in order to 
flesh out the characters' personalities. 

Then there is the problem of visual 
tone: lf!YU more closely resembles a home 
video than nationally broadcast Tv. For 
this, Chen blames · her inability to com-
mand a crew: ''I was too ni~," she says. "I 
wanted everyone to haye- fun. I didn't 
demand enough." But she has 
since abandoned her welcoming 
attitude. ''I just can't have inex-
perienced people. Everybody 
working on this has to be expe-
rienced." 

· ~P to its hype. The length of the entire 
pilot is a measly 15 minutes (including 
three tninutes of credits), which leaves 
the dedicated television viewer with 
that difficult-to-at ticula~e feeling that it 
isn't, well ... good. (In the sense that 
MTV's trashy teen soap Laguna Beach is 
good.) 

The sultry stars of IvyU know this table has more than one use . 

As with most pilot·episPdes, 
the first show introduced char-
acters and set the stage for 
future 
intrigue, 
making 
Lynwood Place seem more like 
Melrose Place. Meet Snow: Laura 
Merriman '08 is the innocent 
ingenue who is starting to feel 
smothered by her nice-guy 
boyfriend, RJ, played by Lucas 
O'Connor, '08. ("l think I just, 
like, need some fresh oxygen, or 
something," she tells him.) 

Providing skanky relief is 
Stephanie (Ashley Fox, '08), 

Still, the premise is undeniably brilliant: 
an ''interactive" soap opera starring your 
peers 
kids you see in lecture 
whose 
destinies are placed in your hands like a 
Choose Your Own Adventure story. "I remem-
ber watching TV in 10th grade, and I real-
ly wanted a character to die, and they just 
wouldn't die," Chen reminisces. "I came to
