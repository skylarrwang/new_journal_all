**Title: The College System**
**Author: Nicole Allan**
**Page number(s): 44-45**

uring my Yale . admissions 
tour, forty overeager high-
schoolers and I were herded 
through the iron gates of Si11itnan, 
arranged in a corner of the Frisbee-dot-
ted courtyard, and regaled with the 
merits of the residential college system. 
A couple of months later, in my inter-
view, I cited these merits as one of my 
prirnary motives for applying to Yale. I 
babbled•about how I longed for an inti-
mate liberal arts experience in the midst 
of a research university and described a 
dream. of four-year friendships, fierce 
loyalty, and a surrogate fami1y. I was cer-
tain lwould be a blissful Yale student. 
Accepted, I spent the endless stretch 
of summer repeatedly logging onto the 
lnterQet, where I was greeted by my 
homepage 
www..yale.edu. I navigated 
my way through residential college 
websites, comparing coats of arms and 
acquiring a fanii1iar ease with the 
Berkeley Dining Hall, the picturesque 
Branford courtyard, and the Silligym. I 
envisioned the envelope containing my 
college assigrunent as my most life-
detern•ining piece of rnai1 to date. I 
knew just enough about the colleges to 
detern•ine that I would be happy 
as 
long as I wasn't in Morse or Ezra-
Stiles. It was an aesthetic opinion; they 
were the "ugly'' colleges, lurking in an 
isolated corner of campus that definite-
ly wasn't included on my adtuissions 
ton£ I held my breath and mentally

chanted, "Not Morse, not Stiles, not 
Morse, . not. Stiles." I opened the letter: . 
Stiles. 

When I lugged my boxes across Old 
Campus in . late . August, I quickly 
learned that Camp Yale is all about col-
leges. Registration meetings, receptions, 
and formal dinners plucked me from 
the grassy, Gothic paradise of Old 
Campus and deposited me amidst the 
irregular angles of Stiles. At gathering 
after g~thering, I was told why my col-
lege was the most tighdy-knit, enthusi-
astic , and charismatic of all Yale's col-
leges. To cope with my disappointtnent, 
I decided to buy into the hype. I attend-
ed study breaks and IM practices armed 
with a rabid devotion to my underdog 
college. I told my parents 
who wor-
ried about the unusual architecture and 
abundance of. critne in Stiles' environs 
-
·that the college's students made up 
for its "undesirable" status. All of my 
friends were in Stiles, and even the din-
ing hall was growing on me. 

hen I arrived at Yale, I tried 
on a new personality. I 
went out two or three 
nights a week, hosted coundess dance 
pat ties in my corrunon room, and thor-
oughly enjoyed mysel£ Removed from 
the college enviromnent by three weeks 
of winter break, however, I was dissatis- . 
fied with the new me. Something about 
rny college experience was beginning to 
• ., 
make me uncomfortable.. . l . sifted 
through my photos on Face~ook.com 
and cringed to see they all featured a 
dressed-up version _ of ·myself posing 
with people I bati:ly knew at· parties I 
scarcely remembered. I spent hours 
recounting these feelings~to my best 
friend from home. At the"" end of one of 
these long sessions, she reassured me, 
c'Don't worry. I lost you there for a biy 
but now you're back." And I was. 

Upon my return to Yale, I was not 
entirely sure how to fix the problem I 
started avoiding everything I had 
embraced during the fall; stopped 
spending tirne in Lawrance, used the 
back door of my suite in order to cir-
cumvent my common room, and cut 
off the Stiles friendships which, up to 
that point, had defined my social life. 
My next step was to find a new world in 
which to irnmerse myself. I strength-
ened friendships I had formed around 
shared interests and activities rather 
than residential proximity. One of my 
closest friends was in Calhoun. I'd met 
and liked a couple of her suitemates. By 
Februaty, I informed my dean that I 
wanted to switch colleges.

success. Reasons range frotn 
aesthetic 
inequality 
''Stiles is depressing and 
ugly" (a transfer request that was not 
granted) 
to a lack of friends in one's 
current college and a concentration of 
them in another. 

Due to a housing crunch this year, 
neither Si11iman nor Trumbull accepted 
transfers, contributing to a slight dip in 
the number of requests and the success 
rate. 'Ibis year, 41 people attempted to

results are more typical: 59 requests to 49 
approvals. These nutnbers reveal that the 
residential college systetn is not without 
its faults 
not surprisingly, though, they 
are not advertised by Yale. 

My dean described the transfer selec-
tion process as "pretty much like 
poker." From what I could gather, the

attempting to switch, and barter. If 
three people leave Branford, the dean 
of that college can accept thtee new 
students. Colleges like to keep the 
in/ out ratio as even as possible. Stiles 
usua11y has a seven-in, seven-out aver-
age; but this year proved a depar tore 
from the norm. Nine students are leav-
ing. No one is switching in. 

he amount of hard work and 
luck necessary to tnake the 
switch prompts n1any students 
to retnain passive even when they are 
unhappy in their colleges. When I

dissatisfactions. But, nn1ike me, they still 
feel a vague loyalty to the college to 
which they were assigned. 

I tnay have insulted some Stilesians 
with my decision, and my story will be 
omitted on an admissions tour of the 
University. A glitch in the ancient and 
infaJJible college system, my t rnnsfer will 
disappear within the greater history of 
Yale University's residential colleges. But 
I signed up for this glorified residential 
college system as advetl ised, and I an1 
still deten nined to experience it to its 
fullest potential. Next year I look for-
ward to living with three of my favorite 
people, going to breakfast in my paja-
'''as, attending Master's Teas, and fanati-
cally screat11ing college cheers with my 
new £uni1y.
