The plan for a set of Whitney-Grove Colleges ended in public disaster and embarrassment. Today, President Richard Levin, who has devoted much of his tenure to revitalizing Yale's infrastructure, has no desire to reenact past misfortunes. Groundwork for the renewed attempt will be laid as firmly as the buildings' future foundations. This time, the early stages will be kept secret: Not since February 2004, when Levin announced that the University was considering between two and four new residential colleges and had been "for some time," has the issue surfaced publicly.


Meetings with alumni about financing these new colleges are conducted under the umbrella of the fund-raising drive, even though Mark Reach '02, a Yale development officer, certifies that "the building of new residential colleges is not part of the upcoming campaign." Vice President for Development Inge Reichenbach ignores Levin's two-year-old announcement and does not acknowledge the discussions her staff conducts. "There are no plans currently to build new residential colleges," she says, "and we therefore have no reason to include a discussion about this topic in any of our meetings with alumni." Vice President for New Haven and State Affairs Bruce Alexander agreed with Reichenbach, writing that "there are no such current efforts." Yet a recent alumni newsletter announced his assumption of new duties including the "development of facilities planning, construction, renovation and operations." This suggests the University is gearing up for major "facilities" projects that will require the city's cooperation.


Regardless of such denials, the increasing student body makes expansion inevitable. Former Vice President for Finance and Administration John Pepper told the Yale Daily News in the days after Levin's announcement that "it was a question of when, not whether, it will happen."


With Levin's on-the-record confession that plans have been mounting, why all the secrecy? Part of the hush is due to the time guaranteed to elapse before ground is broken; Levin and his administration have other priorities before their attention can be fully directed to the expansion of the college system. Most pertinently, renovations to the existing colleges must be completed. With a recent confirmation that Calhoun, Morse, and Stiles are also slated for remodeling, construction of their new brethren is unlikely to be completed for at least a decade.


Levin's announcement explicitly stated the motive for housing expansion. "There are so many outstanding students that we must turn down," he explained. "If Yale has a modest expansion, we would be fulfilling our mission even more than today." With this year's acceptance rate of 8.6% once again setting a new Ivy League record for selectivity, it is clear that students must desperately claw their ways into Yale.


Two new colleges comparable in size to the current twelve would allow the admissions department to make roughly 250 more high school seniors per year happy, and their parents very, very happy.


Some current students, however, worry that the larger class size would threaten class unity. Also, unless new faculty positions were offered (necessitating, of course, new office space), the teacher-student ratio would plunge. This is a serious concern, but those wary of expanding enrollment are not necessarily against the creation of colleges. They claim that the University needs at least that many new beds to accommodate the students it already has; present crowded conditions have annexed as many as half of the junior class in some colleges. Still, a return on the investment calls for new students. And if Levin's motive for construction is to give more high-school seniors a Yale experience, students dreaming of singles will be disappointed.


A different issue is likely to rouse more campus interest: Where will the new colleges be situated? Having learnt from its 1970s mistake, the University will likely build the future residential colleges on land it already owns, denying the city its veto. This restriction limits designers to a handful of possible sites, and the ensuing debate over which to choose is grounded in more than a century of Yale's development.


The terrain of that debate, and of New Haven, was extensively surveyed in a 2000 report Yale commissioned from a New York architecture and urban design firm, Cooper, Robertson & Partners. The 193-page document, *A Framework for Campus Planning*, offers an illustrated examination of the University's architectural legacies, realities, and potential, advising on policies regarding everything from construction and landscaping to signage and transit. As a framework rather than a master plan, it allows for deviation: Yale's decisions can remain flexible.


A preponderance of evidence in the framework points to the area just north of the Grove Street Cemetery on Prospect Street—currently home to a cluster of three-story houses, the avowedly temporary silver "diner," Brewster Hall, and the Art School's Sculpture Department (already slated for relocation to Edgewood)—as the likely new home for eight hundred Yale students. In one of the report's maps, an overlay suggesting future uses lays the word "residential" over the area—though no one lives there. Another diagram, detailing the 19 sites recommended for "major initiatives," suspiciously bifurcates this triangle into 7a and 7c, as one would divide space between two colleges, and allows room for 7b—a pedestrian corridor like Library Walk that would lead students to Swing Space, the gym, and the burgeoning retail on Broadway. The location's new neighbors are further proof of possible University designs for the area: Rose Security Center was recently constructed on Ashmun, and University Health Services' proposed new home is on the corner of Canal and Lock. If these street names are unfamiliar now, they won't be to the class of 2020; their distance from the currently perceived heart of campus is part of their appeal. Yale is moving to surround Grove Street Cemetery.


Science Hill, the focus of renewed University commitment in the form of a five-hundred million dollar suite of construction projects, is alienated from the rest of campus. Bringing two residential colleges to the north axis would reinvigorate the area, moving the figurative center of campus north along College Street from the end of Cross Campus to the front doors of Woolsey Hall. The site is actually no further from Commons than Pierson.


A second proposed site, the east border of Cross Campus, is closer to the current campus center. The old trick frat house at 451 College occupied by the Literature and Religious Studies Departments is slated for demolition, despite recent restoration. Parking Lot 51, which occupies much of the block's interior, will be torn up and moved across Temple Street or underground. Hendrie Hall could stay or go. Either way, acres of land will become available in the very heart of Yale, and everyone is fighting for the privilege of building on it: Departments want more offices, aesthetes hope for open space, and the Music School would always love a larger concert hall. Were it given to the Political Science department as a replacement for Brewster Hall, Yale could simultaneously recognize the discipline's increasing popularity and clear the final barrier to the construction of new colleges on Prospect Street. On the other hand, centrally-located new colleges could trump all of those concerns—no student could complain of being exiled to the hinterlands of campus.


Much less likely candidates are the current location of YUHS on Hillhouse, the awkward corridor now occupied by GPSCY and the Af-Am House, or the site of Davenport and Saybrook's new annex at Harrison Court.


Location will certainly affect the aesthetic of the new colleges, but they will undoubtedly follow the planned renovations of Cross Campus Library in reverting to Yale's traditional courtyards and Collegiate Gothic.


Harvard recently issued a conservative estimate for its expansion across the Charles River that placed the cost of three new dorms at $173 million. While not astronomical, it's hardly pocket change. To attract a donor, Princeton recently agreed to name its sixth college after eBay CEO Meg Whitman, who financed the construction. Whether alumni donors will demand naming rights and whether Yale would grant the request is hard to predict. Yale has long avoided bartering naming rights in exchange for donations. Not one of the existing twelve is named after the donor who paid for it. Even Edward Harkness, whose donations funded more than half of the colleges, was rewarded only with a tower. Vice President Reichenbach would not speculate on whether the University would continue its current tack or echo Princeton's. The latter policy would certainly ease the process of locating donors to cover the project.


If the two alumni interviewed in Washington are an accurate litmus test, the bribe may not be necessary. While not eager to see another Morse or Stiles, both hoped for expansion. Like Levin, alumni are keeping track of record-breaking rejection rates. Those wealthy enough to be substantial donors are often old enough to have kids, whose chances of a large envelope from Yale would be considerably improved by the addition of two more colleges.
