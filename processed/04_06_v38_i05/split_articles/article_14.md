"WEIJ., WE WRAPPED A BOLSTER PII.I.OW

inflatable duck, you know, like the
kind that a child would sit on. And
we cut off its head and stuffed

No, this is not a tidbit from a
particularly traumatizing episode of
Martha Stewart Living. It's Alison
Merrick's
description
her
favorite aspect of her job. As Props
Assistant at the Yale University
Theater, Merrick is the woman in
charge of fip.ding and creating
April2006
props for the eighty productions
the theater stages each season.

When the theater agrees to put
up a show, Merrick and her boss,
Props Master Brian Cookson, pro-
duce props in a number of ways. If
the show has been in production
elsewhere, as this winter's colorful
Brundibar was, it may arrive at the
University Theater with a
full
smorgasbord of props. A director
then decides whether to add or
replace
items.
For
Brundibar,
Merrick dreamt up two tnajor
props: a giant ball of yarn, created
by wrapping a yoga ball in string;
and a baker's tray bearing techni-
color t nuffins. The ball of yarn was
an entirely new addition, the tray, a
replacement for an inferior version
used in earlier perforn1.ances. "This
one is bigger and lighter and more
colorful,'
she
ays.
"And
it
wiggle !"

On the other hand, if the show
debuts at the University Theater,
Merrick and Cookson must build
all of the props themselves. They
begin with props already at their
disposal in the theater's warehouse,
isolated in an industrial area
between Fair Haven and Wooster
Square. The warehouse shares an
enormous space with Tile America,
so as visitors move into floorspace
owned by the University Theater,
the shelves' contents shift from
painted plaster tiles to clunky type-
writers and paisley armchairs.

Props are arranged on the
shelves by type. Populating one
area, like the remnants of an aban-
doned men's room, are three full
toilets, a urinal, and several toilet
seats of various colors. Behind a
pre-stuffed bra made of gold lame
lies a carton of other accessories
that actors use to augment their

"You can buy pie boxes, obvi-
ously," she says. "But the ones ·we
found didn't look enough like pie
boxes." When functional objects
from real life don't serve the aes-
thetic needs of performed
life, Merrick must create
new objects. If com-
pelling items cannot
be found in cata-
logues or among
the piles at
the · ware-
house, . she
must
use
yards of . fab-
ric, inflatable
animals,
and
scraps of hard-
ware to create
larger-than-life
. objects: a pie box
pie-boxier than
any
cardboard
container
that
has ever held a
p1~, or an enor-
mous
ball

postures: walking sticks, canes, and
scepters. Objects that are more
trickier to categorize are strewn
among the piles: A lonesome deer
torso keeps quiet vigil over a forest
of baby carriages and computer
boxes. The props create a feeling of
surrealism. After walking by two
stuffed arms sporting painted-red
fngernails, one feels one has stum-
bled into a Dali painting.

The sheer quantity of. props
makes it easy to forget the effort
that went into each individual
object. They are stored so carefully
because many are hand-crafted
entirely
frorn
raw
materials.
Merrick lists a few props she ha
constructed, among them car ,
trees, and pie boxes. I find the la t
example surprising: Can't he ju t
buy pie boxes?

so alive, o magical that without an

THE TOP FLOOR OF
the Peabody Museum, surrounded

named Ti1m Fa ano
its behind a
box of crayon and a stack of card-
stock. Today is the last Saturday in
February, and there are still a fe~
hours to go until the end of
Dinosaur Days 2006, an annual
week-long event dedicated to the·
giant reptiles that roamed the,
Earth over 65 million years ago.
Fasano is a senior at Hopkins
. '
School who has volunteered at the
Peabody Museum for the past two
years. "All of the events run
together" he reminisces, "but I
remember the hats." His booth
offers Peabody visitors the chance
to construct dinosaur headgear. A.
gloating tod4ler struts by wearing a
Tyrannosaurus rex hat
by
this~
time in the afternoon, Fasano has
run out of that particular species.

Celebrated for over twenty,
years,
Dinosaur
Days
is
the
longest-standing annual event at

sters trailed by bedraggled parents
flll the Great Hall, built in 1929 to
house the enormous Apatosaurus·
skeleton that still dominates ' the
space. A flve-year old girl stanles
herself while gazing at the giant
skull of the long-extinct carnivore,;
while two slightly older boys point
i
excitedly to the smoking volcanoes
and swooping pterodactyl depicted
in the The Age of Reptiles mural
above.

This year's Dinosaur Days is
especially signiflcant due to the the
recently
unveiled
bronze
Torosaurus latus sculpture gracing
the Museum's lawn. The dinosaur's
likeness is scattered throughout the
museum's interior
and on its
inhabitants' heads. A sign on the
second-floor landing proclaim_s:'
"Torosaurus:
A
Peabody
Dinosaur."
David Heiser,
museum's
Event
Coordinator,
proudly explains how Peabody visi-
tors recently had a chance to use
the clay left over from the sculp-
ture's full-scale model to create
their own Torosaurus sculptures.
