His

l 
contacts at . the Yale University Art 
Gallery thought of him when the long-
term renovation of the Gallery's sculp-
ture garden began, and one of them had 
the bright idea to evacuate the sculpture 
across the street to Jonathan Edwards. A 
crane was duly procured, and the statue 
was, in turn, lifted, rolled, and pushed 
into the Master's garden. It has neyer left. 
The Art Gallery has never ~asked.- for it 
back, and there has never been· a formal 
agreement about its status 
only, as 
Master Haller puts it, Han unders~ding.'; 
The first year, a group of students 
opposed the statue so vehemendy that 
they circulated a petition for its removal. 
Haller dug in his heels: "It's my back-
yard, and the sculpture stays!" he told 
them. By 1999, though, the residents of 
JE had loosened up enough to adopt 
the thing as a sort of mascot. "They 
started ca11ing it 'the Master's phallic 
symbol,"' Haller ruefully recalls, "and 
that was that." Once, a student even 
asked to deck the statue with Christmas 
lights for the holiday season. Master 
Haller approved the project, but an emi-
nent professor of Art History was so 
incensed with the Hdisrespectful viola-
tion of the integrity of the piece" that 
nobody dared touch it again. 


When I ask Master Haller how he 
feels about the integrity of the piece, he 
gt ins. ''Well ... I like it now. It took a 
while. When they first asked me to take 
it, I said, 'It's not my favorite piece ... but 
it's not unattractive.' Now it's become 
attractive because it's familiar." But what 
is it, anyw~y? The Master thrusts a huge 
book at me: ''Here, take this. I don't 
really know anything. I don't even know 
what's in this book." 

It turns out that the sculpture is, 
indeed, a helmet of sorts. It's called 
Floating Helmets and was envisioned by 
the Greek-American artist Dimitri Hadzi 
in 1963 as one of a series of sculptures 
of helmets. These pieces are variously 
said to evoke the warriors of the ancient 
world, the devastating mushroom clouds 
of modern warfare, and 
of course-
sex. Or, as one art historian puts it, there 
is a highly "dominant phallic content" 
that brings "sexual overtones ... to an 
aggressive extreme." Hadzi seems to be 
one of those perennially underappreciat-
ed artists who resurface every few years 
just long enough for their supporters to 
make desultory pleas for relevance. One 
such supporter, Hadzi's longtime friend 
Seamus Heaney, writes (perhaps a bit too 
raptut_ously) of Hadzi's 
sculptures, 

"They excite the viewer's whole being, 
making it want to Jly round and round in 
delighte~reconnaissance."

don't care about the sculpture except as a

Master's

indeed! 
and why should we? After all, 
what does it mean to live with a piece of 
art? To make fun of it. To bring it down 
to our level 
or to let our simple, unwit-
ting ignorance bring it down. It gets nick-
named. It get compared to body parts. 
For better or for worse, it doesn't make a 
big difference to anything or anyone:-
it's no Mona Lisa, after all-and as we pass, 
it quickly fades into a forgotten form. We 
think instead about ourselves. Ten feet 
from the statue, two JE students are in 
conversatlon. 
''I'm learning about symbio-... symbo-
lo-... symbiology," a freshman girl spits 
out proudly. 
"Uh, what's that?" her companion asks. 
"U m, it's symbols," she says. ''I .ike what 
· 
mean and why." They walk off into 
the heat of the day, away from the shadowy 
crevices of the college they call hor r 1e, 
oblivious to the floating helmets of 
Floating Helmets looming above, and what 
they mean, and why.
