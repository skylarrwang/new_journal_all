its own, private, privately-funded military 
training program 
while the U.S. was 
neutral." 

In 1916, when war with Germany 
seemed . inevitable, Congress officially 
established the current form of ROTC. 
Yale was one of the charter members. 

Almost immediately, the faculty expressed 
its unhappiness that courses such as 
"Stable Management" counted for Yale 
College credit, but the program went 
largely unchallenged for five decades. 
During that rime, Yale students fought in 
the two World Wars in such great numbers 
that, according to Smith, "the only civil-
ians remaining at Yale were either very 
young, or in some cases old or disabled." 
But in the face of the Vietnam War, 
attitudes towards the military at Yale 
became highly unfavorable. "The anti-war 
movements at Yale and around the coun-
try .. . saw ROTC as the symbol of 
University support in an immoral war," 
Smith said. Etnboldened by anti-war and 
anti-ROTC sentiments, Yale professors 
finally acted on their long-standing dissat-
isfaction with the program. Supported by 
the Yale Corporation, professors present-
ed the Pentagon with a list of changes 
ROTC would have to implement in order 
to stay on campus: Students would no 
longer receive Yale College credit for 
ROTC courses; ROTC instructors would 
lose their titles as Yale professors; and 
whereas previously, the military had not 
allowed them to pursue studies in certain 
departments such as Art History or 
Anthropology, ROTC students would be 
free to major in whatever subject they 
wished. The Pentagon rejected the faculty 
proposal, and · in 1969, ROTC was 
expelled from Yale. 


oday, ROTC and Yale are tenu-
ously 
linked. 
Because 
the 
University lacks an ROTC battal-
ion; interested students must travel to 
nearby campuses that do host them: Army 
ROTC is hosted by Sacred Heart, and Air 
Force ROTC by the University of 
·c onnecticut's Storrs campus. No school 
in Cqnnecticut offers N avy ROTC. 
N onetheless, Yale still provides some 
support for its ROTC students. It pays 
for the rental cars, tardy though they may 
be, that the cadets drive to the University 
of Connecticut and Sacred Heart every 
week. It also provides them with a uni-
versity-affiliated ROT C advisor: Yale's 
Director 
of 
System 
Engineering 
Facilities, Jerry Hill. 

Hill was chosen as ROTC advisor by 
former Yale College Dean Richard 
Brodhead, who deemed his twenty years 
of ser vice in the Navy "appropriate life 
experience." His role is primarily logisti-
cal; he serves as a liaison between Yale 
students and ROTC officials. 

ver the years, various groups 
have tried to bring ROTC back 
to Yale. The most recent failed 
attempt was championed by the Yale 
College Republicans during the 2004-
2005 school year. As in 1969, today's 
ROTC proponents are challenged by a 
war that is largely unpopular among Yale 
students. But unlike in 1969, when the 
academic veracity of ROTC was the 
other key point of tension, it is now the 
military's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy 
that has turned many faculty and stu-
dents against on-campus recruitment. 
Professors and students at the law 
school have flied a series of lawsuits 
against the Department of Defense to 
protest the Solomon Amendment, a . 
piece of legislation mandating that any 
university receiving federal~undltig allow 
military recruitment on its ca.inpus .. ~d, 
~ 
during the Yale College Republican's 
recent attempt to reinstate the prbgram, 
Yale University President Richard Levin 
publicly sounded off on the issue, 
announcing that he found the "Don't 
Ask, Don't Tell" policy "shameful." 

n spite of the controversy associat-
ed with ROTC, neither Hammerle, 
nor Benji Hurlburt, another Air 
Force ROTC cadet, has encountered 
much campus criticism for their ROTC 
participation. They both point to an inci-
dent that occurred last spring while they 
were manning a ROTC information 
booth during Bulldog Days as the only 
memorable exception. 
''A girl was handing out 'Lies About the 
Militat y' fliers right next to our table," 
Hurlburt recalled "Mostly, people just ask 
me what it's about, though." 
''My friends think my tmiform's pretty 
cool," he added. 

either Hammerle nor Hurlburt 
portrays his decision to enroll in 
ROTC 
as 
overtly 
political. 
Hamr nerle saw it as a way to show his 
gratitude . for the comforts afforded by 
American citizenship. ''I haven't had a lot 
to worry about," he said. ''I thought I had 
to give something back to my country, and 


military service is. a way to do that." 
Hammerle also sees his future career as 
an Air Force jet pilot as one he can easily 
translate 
to 
civilian 
sphere. 
"Leadership is something I'm definitely 
looking into," he said. He is also aware 
that, as a Yale student, his desire to pursue 
leadership opportunities does not set him 
apart. ''A lot of people at Yale want to be 
leaders, but they don't want to do it 
through military service." Pointing to the 
political ambitions of many Yale students, 
Hammerle added, ''Truthfully, I think that 
the American people would be very skep-
·tical of someone who's going to be send-
ing our troops into battle without having 
· been there himsel£" 

Aside from ROTC, there are other 
routes that college students can pursue if 
ithey want to receive officers' commis-
r 
. 
~jons upon graduating. All college gradu-
ates are eJigibfe to apply to Officer 
CandKfate School, a 14-week training

"'tiJ-at, like ROTC, prepares them 
to ert~tf tlie tni1i~ as officers. The U.S. 
..,. 
Marine Corp. also offers a Platoon 
'I eaders Course, in which aspiring offi-
cers complete training over the course of 
two summers. According to Hill, approx-
imately twenty Yale students currently 
participate in the program, and part of its 
appeal lies in that it requires a weaker 
commiunent than ROTC. 
''When you graduate, you are not 
to join the Marines, nor are they 
obliged to take you," said-Yale's ROTC 
advisor, Jerry Hill. ''They have a no-harm 
approach there." 

ROTC, by contrast, does require its 
cadets to join the military upon gradua-
tion, and they usnal1y make a binding 
couunitment by the end of their sopho-
more year. It also requires students to 
conunit a sizeable amount of time to the 
miJitary while they are in college. Yet, the 
progra.tn has its own advantages over 
other forms of officer 
· · . Most 
notably, while the Platoon Leaders Course 
provides students with some financial aid 
for college, ROTC is one of the few pro-
of any kind that offers students siz-
able anerit-based scholarships. 
~'If you're a middle-class family and 
can't apply for financial aid but can't 
quite afford to send your kid to a place 
like Yale, the ROTC scholarship is a 


good way to go," Hill said. 

Not all ROTC students are on schol-
arship, and many have reasons aside 
from financial aid to join the military. 
Hill noted that a number of recent Yale 
cadets have joined Air Force ROTC 
because they want to become pilots. But 
in almost the same breath, he empha-
sized that he believes ROTC students 
are at least partially tnotivated by ideo-
logical concerns. "They all do it to serve 
their country on some level," he said. 
"There are other ways to fly planes." 

Patriotism aside, Hill said that this 
year's class of four cadets reflects typical 
involvement in the program. 
"It's interesting since we've gone 
through 9/11 that there doesn't seem to 
be an appreciable increase in interest in 
ROTC [at Yale]," he said. "We haven't 
seen an application increase." 
"Some of the older alumni think that 
[the current] generation is not as patriot-
ic as the older generation," he added, 
"Which is unfortunate. The military 
needs people like Yale students-smart, 
critical thinkers, problem-solvers." 

Perhaps Yale students are simply 
wary of entering such a difficult and 
dangerous career. Those in the military, 
even officers, make sacrifices unasked of 
their civilian counterparts 
they bind 
themselves into a contract to accept low 
pay, 
live 
in 
far-flung, 
sometimes 
unpleasant locations, and work within a 
system unrivaled for its discipline and 
rigidity. They also face occupational haz-
ards 
injury and even death 
that few 
other Yale students consider when 
weighing 
future 
career 
options. 
Hammerle noted that one of the rea-
sons Yale students may not join the mil-
itary en masse is that they are unwilling to 
make a potentially fatal commitment. 
"It's .really tough," he said sincerely . 
"We have it pretty happy and easy here. 
Why put that at risk for an objective you 
might not believe in?" 

enji Hurlburt's primary moti-
vation to join ROTC had 
more to do with the specific 
opportunities it offers than with a 
strong desire to enter national service. 
Hltrlb11rt St!fS his .friends "think nry 11niform s pref!Y cool. n 

"It's kind of a dream of mine to be a 
pilot," he said. ''And getting college paid 
for 
that really helps." 
Hurlburt sees the lack of ROTC 
involvement at Yale as a Yale-specific 
problem. "I think maybe people at Yale 
think a job in the military isn't something 
Yale students do when they graduate 
it's 
for ordinary people," he said. 
"People think of going into politics or 
becoming a doctor," he added. "They 
don't put military service on the same 
level. .. Maybe it's just the culture of Yale 
in general, which isn't · as patriotic as 
other places." 

Ironically, Hurlburt's aspirations as a 
pilot place him in the same situation as 
Yale students competing for extremely 
selective jobs. Unlike Hammerle, who has 
already 
received 
his 
cornnussion ' 
Hurlburt, as a sophomore, is still compet-
ing with Air Force cadets across the coun-
try for one of the few pilot slots available 
to ROTC cadets every year. In some ways, 
his status as a Yale student places him at a 
disadvantage; ''To be a pilot, when you're 
competing, GPA is a factor," he said. 
'~They don't take into account what class-
es you're taking ... They put all your num-
bers in a database, and if you're above a 
certain percentage, you're in." 

n ROTC,. Hurlburt's identity is little 
more than a number in a database a 
fact that may point to a reason for 
the progratn's decline at Yale. As an insti-
tution that champions the individuality of 
its students, its values may simply be anti-
thetical to mmta t y participation. 
Nonetheless, in spite of the limitations 
it places upon its cadets, both Hammerle 
and Hurlburt have forged individual iden-
tities as students outside of ROTC during 
their time at Yale. Hammerle is an avid 
participant in intranmral sports 
he was 
captain of the Morse inner tube water 
polo team for three years in a row while 
Hurlburt was recendy narned director of 
The Purple Crayon, an improv comedy 
troupe. 

back on the past four 
years, Han unerle doesn't believe that 
ROTC has defined his tirne at Yale. 
'~ definitely missed out on a couple of 
classes I wanted to take," he said ''But 
ROTC is kind of a different world for 
me. Thursday comes around and I go to 
Storrs, then I come back and forget 
about ROTC." 

or Jason Pampena, however,· 
ROTC proved to be too much of 
a time committnent he stopped 
participating at the beginning of this 
semester. 
"I left because it just didn't fit into my 
schedule," he said. "If that hadn't been the 
case, I would have definitely stayed in 
through the end of the year." 
Like Hammerle, Pampena was attracted 
to the military because of the public serv-
ice opportunities it affords. But during the 
fall, his trips to Storrs interfered with an 
EMf training course he was also taking. 
Pampena also ·said that he found hiniSdf 
questioning whether the goverru:J:nent was 
using the military · in a proper m~er. 
Now he lists Teach for America and the 
Peace Corps as post-college opportunities 
that interest him, though he has not ruled · 
out the possibility of joiniQg the- military 
upon graduation. 

very day, thousands of stu-
dents, including Hammerle, 
Hurlburt, and Pampena pass 
through the rotunda of Commons 
where, carved into the walls are the 
names of every Yale student or graduate 
who has died serving his country in the 
Armed Forces. Entering frorn Beinecke 
Plaza, one is confronted by the names of 
those who fell early in Yale's history: in 
the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, 
the Civil War. Moving forward into the 
adjoining foyer, it is possible to be over-
whelmed by the a1most uncountable 
names of those who died during the two 
World Wars. Exiting into the rotuilda, 
one passes two short walls listing the 
names of those who died in the Korean 
War and in Vietnam, ending with Francis 
A11ard Boyer, class of 1969, who died on 
December 3, 1972. Althoqgh in the past 
several decades, U.S. mi1itary fatalities 
have paled in comparison to earlier eras, 
the names do not stop because wars 
stopped. They stop because Yale stu-
dents stopped joining the military.
