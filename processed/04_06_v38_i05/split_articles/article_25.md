lope dwindle . each year. "From the
point of view of alumni," one com-
mented, expansion seems like "a good
thing because it has been so hard to get
your kids in."


If that enthusiasm inspires dona-
tions ·without the stipulation of naming
rights, the names of these new colleges
may be up .for grabs. Kingman
Brewster is a slightly stodgy option~ but
an appropriate one,
especially if
Brewster Hall is demolished to make
way .for the new structures. Sinclair
LeWis, Class of 1908,
could also
deserve a college on merit; John
Hersey '36 would be an appropriate
counterpart.
Both
have

includ-
ing John C. Calhoun, the intellectual
progenitor of the Confederacy
there
may be pressure to consider female and
minority namesakes for the 13th and
14th college. Maya Lin's name is often
dropped in that regard.
Annie Talbot '7 5 facetiously
described the onerous burden of living
in Calhoun, saying that she "frequently
had to apologize for liv iog in the col-
lege named after a slaveholder. So I
guess it would be wise to stay away
from luminaries whose subsequent
reputation may be tainted by political
incorrectness." Talbot suggests Meryl
Streep, arguing that enough is enough
on Maya Lin
she has a Yale memori-
al already. But other options arise. c~

of the current college names are so
WASPy
there should be one with a
Jewish name. How about Levin? What
other Jews are associated with Yale?".
Could future students live in Wendy
Wasserstein College?
Tierney also suggests naming
them after fictional Yalies, who are
currently as underrepresented as
women and minorities. Crotchety
Simpsons overlord Montgomery Burns
'14, Bonfire of the Vanities anti-hero
Sherman McCoy, and Fitzgerald's
violent, adulterous Tom Buchanan
'15 are among those who might have
the means to buy the honorific out
from underneath those more deserv-
ing, like fake alumni Nick Carraway (a
member of Buchanan's secret socie-
ty) and Michael Doonesbury who,
like his creator, began as a lowly Yale
undergrad.
Whoever the 13th and 14th col-
leges are named after will secure a
place in Yale's history. Contrary to
Talbot's joking suggestion to name
them after Levin, there is no need to
commemorate the Yale President so
explicitly
as the overseer of the
planning and construction of these
edifices, he will have left a large
mark. The 13th and 14th residential
colleges are a fitting feather in the
cap of a President who renovated
the
first
twelve.
Opening
University he has rebuilt to the
denizens of new colleges is a worthy
endeavor, and one wbose rirne, if
still only in secret, has come.
