EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
early last month, a Yale· alumna in Washington, D. C. agreed to take a quick 
meeting with a University development officer, on the concHtio{\ that the 
officer would not attempt to solicit any donations. The meeting, later 
described by the alumna as "very low-key," was only one in an extended 
series of interviews currently being conducted by Yale development officers across the country . 

They are part of the "quiet phase" of a major University fundraising drive scheduled to be unveiled 
in September. Representatives are currently conducting a vast 
number of interviews with alumni to pinpoint topics 
that will make nostalgia flourish, hearts rush, and 
money flow, which will allow the Development 
Office to finalize its fundrasing goals. 


**Yale's Expanding Residential Colleges**

Indeed, the officer conducted anoth-
er such discussion within the hour with 
an . alumnus who worked just a few 
offices away from her first stop. After 
both meetings, the alumni reported that 
Richer had 
casually 
sketched 
the 
University's hopes for what could be 
achieved and asked for their reactions. 
Nothing too innovative, the of~cer
suggested, just expansions of current proj-
ects 
except for one thing: adding two 
' more residential colleges. "Would you 
have a reaction to that?" 
lumni have heard this pitch 
before. From its 1933 incep-
tion, the residential college sys-
tem has evolved to accommodate a 
frC?)Ving student population. In fact, a 
S_"Yell in enrollment was the system's orig-
inal impe~~_,_ Okl'Brick Row, the alternat-
U:.~ _. &.S;f:s of rectangular dorms and 
ch~0~~~tJjat housed Yale in its early 
days,i~~ 
not _ eyen provide eno~h 
beds ·for the smaller student population 
of 1870. The current Old Campus, hap-
hazardly built in the final decades of the 
19th century, was also quickly outgrown. 
The 750 students who graduated in 1920 
could have wiped the floor with their 
fathers' class in a rousing (if not particu-
larly suspenseful) game of Bladderball, 
for they outnumbered the Class of 1899 
by more than two to one. Connecticut 
Hall, the last vestige of O~d Brick ·Row, 
was preserved as auxiliary housing, but 
even its salvation could not forestall the 
pending crisis. Had such growth accrued 
today, Yale might have simply squeezed 
an unprecedented third bed inside a 
Bingham single. The students of a hun-
dred years ago, however, would not stand 
for such indignities and began to move 
off campus in droves. 

By 1925, the housing situation had 
grown untenable. That winter, University 
President James R Angell submitted a 
plan for "dividing the student body into 
a number of groups somewhat resem-
bling the English colleges." With new 
students to fill the space and a donation 
from Edward Harkness, Class of 1897, 
to provide grist for the mil1, 1933 saw the 
construction of new buildings and the 
birth of the first seven undergraduate 
colleges. As Yale's student population
continued to grow, new residences were 
quickly added: Berkeley in 1934, Timothy 
Dwight in 1935, and Silliman in 1940. 
Morse and Stiles followed in 1961, 
replacing a city public schooL 

The arrival of coeducation in 1969 pre-
sented Yale with a choice: scale back male 
enrollment or increase housing. For then-
President Kingman Brewster, the decision 
was clear. Hoping to replicate the success 
his predecessor had enjoyed a decade ear-
lie.r, he commissioned plans to construct 
the 13th and 14th residential college. 

The plans had the three key ingredi-
ents: a donor, a site, and a stack of blue-
prints. A donation by 1926 alnt n John 
Hay would fund the colleges. They 
would be built on land just north of 
Timothy Dwight, bordered by Whitney, 
Grove, and Tetnple Streets 
Yale on two 
sides, New Haven on two others. 
Mitchell/ Giurgola Associates, the archi-
tectural firm hired to design the site, 
hoped the new colleges would serve as "a 
vital area where the University tnerges 
with the City, a crossroads for cat r1pus 
and comnmoity, a place of encounter." 
To facilitate this town-gown bonding, the 
proposed nine-story highrises bore little 
resemblance to traditional, courtyard-ori-
entated acadetnic enclaves. Cotmnercial 
facilities and parking lots would occupy 
the building at street level. Though gates 
would restrict access to the sma11, sunken 
courtyards, public walkways ~ould trans-
verse the site to promote the sense of 
connection to the city. 

Even the building's aesthetic, featured 
in adjacent drawing, would join it. with 
the city, combining the reds of 'ID with 
the white of surrounding city structures. 
To achieve this, the oversized, russet 
bricks of the fa<_;:ade would be punctuat-
ed by juu ing, off-white plexiglass bay 
windows that seemed plucked from the 
set of Fritz_ Lang's Metropolis. These mod-
ules would be outfitted with desks so that 
students could contemplate the city while 
contemplating A Tale if Two Cities-
a 
concurrence that might prompt them to 
apply their academic expertise on real-
world problems. 

The rooms were grouped into suites 
containing four to eight singles that 
shared a bathroom, a living room, and a 
kitchen. Together, these spaces were 
incorporated into three-story com-
pounds, with half of the students living 
above the comtnon area and the other 
half below. The plan abandoned the tra- . 
ditional entryway system even more deci-
sively than Morse and Stiles, ca11ing for 
hallways whose exterior walls would be 
glass flooding the buildings with light 
and further emphasizing a connection 
with the city. 

But the city, it turned out, wanted 
none of it. Brewster faced strong oppo-
sition from the Mavor's Office a stark 
contrast to the reception President 
Alfred Griswold had enjoyed when he
