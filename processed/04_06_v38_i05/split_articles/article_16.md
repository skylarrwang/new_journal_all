"GENILEMEN, IN AU. PROBABILITY YOU 
are writing better now than you will 
ever write again." The year was 
1952, and Edward Weeks, a guest 
lecturer at Yale and then-Editor-in-
Chief of Atlantic Month!J, stared 
down from a podium at an attentive 
group of Yale men: star students 
from the English Departrnent's 
Daily Themes class. Gaddis Stnith 
peered 
back.

' 
Emeritus of History, Smith believes 
Weeks was right. He and his class-
mates probably never regained the 
intense "spontaneity and energy" 
that breathed so freely through 
their best themes.- In 19 52, Daily 
Themes was already a legend, and 
over the years it has only become 
more mythic. Along with Smith, 
legendary men of letters such as 
Calvin Trillin and William 
F. 
Buckley have graced its roster and 
gone on to write about the course 
in their memoirs. 

The class first appeared in the 
Yale curriculum as "Short Themes" 
in 1903 and was christened "Daily 
Themes" by Assistant Professor of 
English C.S. Baldwin in 1907. John 
Berdan taught from 1907 until 1941 
and as Professor Smith recalls, he 
was the man who really "invented 
Daily Themes." In Calvin Trillin's 
1966 New Yorker article about the 
class, he lists Berdan's eight slogans: 
"Individualize by Specific Detail! 
Vivify 
by 
Range 
of Appeal! 
Characterize 
Speech 
and 
Gesture! Clarify by Point of View! 
Unify by a Single Impression! 
Combine Details for Coherence! 
Charge Words with Connotation! 
Choose Words for their Sounds!" 

Richard Sewell, a revered English 
professor and the first master of 
-
Ezra 
Stiles 
College, 
echoed 
Berdan's maxi rns when he took 
over the course in the 1940s. 
As 
described 
Trillin, 
Sewell's words at a teaching 
conference highlighted his 
predecessor's legacy: "Sewell 
c 
a 
I 
e ·· d 
'Individualize by 
Specific 
Detail' 
the eye opener in 
Daily 
Themes' 
attempt to revtve 
the sensitivity to 
detail ... a 
'return 
to the vivid, hon-
est, 
direct 
Writing daity can be a 
~- - --~ 
-~ 
~
obs_ervation of children."' Half a• 
century after taking the class, Smith 
still clearly ·remembers being taught 
to characterize through detail: "Do 
not write: 'John was an angry man.'-
Write: 'John kicked the dog down 
the stairs."' The example is a critical' 
lesson for any serious ·writer. After' 
a decline in the sixties culminated in· 
the course's two-year absence from 
the curriculum, John Hollander 
revived the class in 1979. 

Today's Daily Themes students 
' •• 
must attend lecture every Tuesday 
and write a 250-300 word theme 
every weekday, and discuss their! 
written themes in a weekly tutorial. 
Each week focuses on a different 
aspect of writing: Point of View, 
Diction, 
Journals, 
Sentence· 
Rhythms, and so on. According to· 
> 
the current professor of Daily 
Themes Bill Deresiewicz, some of 
these topics focus on "writing at 
the most atomic level; some are. 
forms of narrative, and some are 
elements of narrative." At the lec-
ture, the professor reads selections 
by authors who have tackled the' 
week's topic with particular aplomb.' 
Sometirnes, the writers themselves 
took 
the 
course. 
And 
yet not 
everyone in Daily Themes wants 
to pursue writing professionally. 
Although 
few 
will 
actually 
become novelists, poets, or jour-
nalists, Professor Deresiewicz 
treats all as if they wilL He 
believes that "to be a writer is to 
live a certain kind of life. It's 
about learning to look at the 
world, taking a responsibility for 
the truth. If you· are deciding to 
do that, you are throwing the 
weight of your soul behind it." 

For a single semester, Daily 
Themes' students are united 
with each other and with their 
predecessors by their common 
decision to make a commitment 
to the writing life. 

As the Daily Themes student 
sits down every night at a laptop, 
staring in haggard anguish at the 
cursor ticking across a blinking 
white screen, an insatiable lover 
whispers in his ear, relentlessly 
goading. The lover is notorious-
ly brutal, but perversely sweet.' 
The writer must continually 
rekindle passion, refine emotion, 
plumb experience: He recalls .the. 
generations of Yale students 
before him as they too must 
have stared at blank paper, 
absently fiddling with fountain 
pens. Encouraged by this bond, 
student 
might 
begin: 
"Charles stared at the blank 
white door to his study. He knew 
Katerina had heard him come in; 
he could hear her arranging die 
folds of her dressing gown 
across the sofa, every detail cal-
culated to unsettle him into sub-
mission. But he could only sigh. 
For the hundredth time, his
