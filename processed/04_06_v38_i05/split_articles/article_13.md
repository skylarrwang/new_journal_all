lN DOWNTOWN NEW HAVEN, THE WRITING
is quite literally on the wall. On
Court Street
a few buildings down
from the orthographically sinister
awning. of "Cryptonnite Beauty
Salon"
a Viennese furrier has
posted a handwritten note inform-
ing his clients that he will return by
April 20th. Close to Chapel Street, a
plaque commemorates the world's
first
commercial
telephone
exchange, which opened . in 1878
. several hundred feet away from the
current location of a Southwestern
Bell Corporation building. Ghostly
messages traced on its dusty win-
dows read "Dixwell" and "7 -26-
02." On the other side of the same
building, at the corner of Court and
State Streets, two plaques hang next
to _each other. One is an unexpected
and well-ornamented tribute to the
1856 founding of a B'nai B'rith
lodge; the other plaque causes one
to pause.

Installed on March 6th, 1976,
the plaque bears a quotation from a
speech Abraham Lincoln gave in
New Haven on that same date 116
•
years earlier. During his campaign
for pt;esident in 1860, Lincoln
toured
Connecticut,
speaking
forcibly against the extension of
the institution of slavery. The
plaque on Court Street, however,
focuses not on slavery but on labor-
ers' right to strike:

I'm glad that a system of labor
prevails in
ew England under
which laborers can strike when
'
. thry want to. . . J like the system
which lets a man quit when he
wants to . .. One of the reasons
I am opposed to slavery is just
here.

Appropriately, the Bicentt:nnial
Labor Commission of Greater New
Haven sponsored the Court Street
plaque.

The strike to which Lincoln
refers was not confined to New
Haven. Earlier that year, shoemak-
ers in Massachusetts had gone on
strike, inciting twenty thousand
shoemakers across New England to
join the movement. In the years fol-
lowing
Lincoln's speech, New
Haven would. see a number of sim-
ilar labor movements. Printers went
on strike after a typesetting quarrel
broke out between newspapers, and
an 1871 issue of The 'New Haven
Evening Register enigmatically report-
ed~ c'Some days ago, Quigley's
plumbers were said to have been on
a strike. That announcement was a
mistake. All the plumbers but those
at Quigley's were on a strike, and
they have probably returned to
their work by this time."

The rights of laborers, then,
were certainly relevant to those
who listened to Lincoln's speech.
Yet the plaque's declaration that
Lincoln spoke "against slavery and
for labor's rights" is rnisleading.
Although Lincoln advocated for
laborers' rights, his words are
embedded in a larger anti-slavery
argument and are often considered
sitnply one of the means by which
he campaigned against slavery. In
fact, the fust ellipsis on the sign

stands in for Lincoln's praist; of
workers who "are not tied · down
and obliged to labor whether you
pay them or not." This rhetoric of
bondage, deliberately omitted. by
the plaque's designers, reminds us
that, in New Haven, Lincoln was
primarily speaking against slavery~

In The Library of America's collec-
tion of his writings, the speech runs
17 pages long, and t~ paragraph
from which the Bicentennial Labor
.,.
Commission
of
Greater . New
Haven drew their quotation "is one
of the very few moments that
Lincoln refers to the labor move-
ment. This particular· speech ·is
more often · remembered for the
extended passage in which he com-
pares slavery to a "venomous
snake" in bed with children.

In transforming the sound of
Lincoln's voice into metal, the
Bicentennial Labor Commission
also performed an act of referential
alchemy, compelling the quotatioq
to stand in tribute to labor unions.
It all likelihood, the conunission
wished to honor · the. New Haven
public school teachers_ who were
arrested for striking the year before
the plaque was commis~ion~d.

Like the flyers an_d awnings that
run along Court Street, the plaque
is an advertisement, selling o~e par-
ticular interpretation of history--· -
with Abraham Lincoln
as its
spokesman. This street corner is a
lesson . in how history is made,
reminding us that to quote . is
always, perhaps, to tnisquote. After
all, I .incoln hianself
