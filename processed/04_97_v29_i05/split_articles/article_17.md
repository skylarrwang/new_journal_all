Slow Motion 
in the Court

tanding outside of Courtroom 4 of the New Haven Courthouse 
on Elm Street, David Kaplan, a public defender for the last 18 
years, patiently answers questions from some of his clients while 
struggling to hold a two-foot-high stack of bulging folders. Pri-
vate lawyers zip by, holding one or two files. Along with one other pub-
lic defender, one investigator, and one secretary, Kaplan handles all the 
public defender cases for Geographic Area 8 (GA 8), which includes 
East Haven and its environs. Kaplan wl_ll represent approximately 100 
clients thiS month; the American Bar Association prescribes 300 as the 
maximum that defense attorneys should in a year. Projecting from fig-
ures for past months, Kaplan will handle over 1,100 cases between Sep-
tember 1996 and September 1997. 

Regardless of their caseloads, GA public defenders like Kaplan do a 
remarkably good job. According to the Chief Public Defenders Office, 
of the 68,000 cases handled by public defenders in the GA courts last 
year, more than one-third were thrown out of court, while fewer than 
24 percent resulted in incarceration. While there are no comparative 
statistics for private lawyers, such a low incarceration rate is impressive 
by any measure. 

But because of public defenders' heavy caseloads and slim resources, 
the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union (CCLU) feels that Kaplan's 
clients, and all public defender clients in Connecticut, aren't receiving 
the adequate representation guaranteed to them by the Constitution 
and by Connecticut law. State law stipulates thaf any individual 
charged with a crime punishable with incarceration and whose weekly 
income falls below prescribed Limits (roughly $200 a week for a single 
person) is eligible for a public defender. The CCLU has sued Governor 
John Rowland and the Public Defender Services Commission on behalf 
of"all indigent persons who are or will be represented by public defend-
ers." The lawsuit, /?jvera et ai. v. Rowland et ai., calls for an increase in 
funding and a reduction of caseloads for public defenders. 

The CCLU's complaint puts public defenders like Kaplan in an 
awkward position, forcing them to keep one foot on either side of the 
lawsuit's legal divide. While their sympathies may Lie largely with the 
plaintiffs who are their clients, public defenders must answer to their 
bosses who are the defendants in the suit-the Public Defenders Ser-
vice Commission and Governor Rowland. And, in order to get the 
increased funding and reduced caseloads that the CCLU demands, the 
public defenders must prove they're not doing their jobs. The CCLU is 
trying to save the public defender srstem by destroying it, emphasizing 
its shortcomings and pointing out where it has failed, while ignoring its 
record of success. 

Gerard Smyth, Connecticut's chief public defender, was one of

those forced to choose between his clients and his bosses. In the Con-
necticut Law Tribune, Smyth criticized the CCLU's suit as misleading. 
His opposition to the suit is somewhat ironic because he shares with the 
plaintiffs in the case the ultimate goal of improving public defense. But 
Smyth's commitment to improvement is secondary to his conviction 
that public defenders already provide effective representation. He wrote 
in his article, "While [the public defender system's] most significant 
accomplishments can be detailed and celebrated, its greatest success lies 
in the small victories that are attained on behalf of clients on a daily 
basis by attorneys, investigators, social workers and support staff across 
the state who have dedicated their careers to this effort." 

K
aplan's small daily victories occur inside of Courtroom 4 where 
dark wood paneling, a high ceiling, and a large marble wall 
clock hearken back to a time when justice was established-
imposing and blind. The entire building with its tall Corinthian 
columns and surrounding statues of sage Roman lawgivers faces New 
Haven Green. At the center of the ciry, the legal system used to be one 
of the pillars of sociery. 

Nowadays, the ceiling of Courtroom 4 is green with circular marks 
due to water damage. No one has bothered to plaster or paint over the 
holes that have been drilled to drain the water. Next to the gallery 
where spectators sit, the paneling has been carved up by rudimentary 
graffiti, exec.uted hastily with pens and keys, despite the vigilant glares 
of armed representatives from the New Haven Sheriff's Office. The 
marble clock face mounted high on the wall has no hands on it. Maybe 
this is intended to send the message that justice is timeless. Maybe it 
indicates that the court is behind the times. Maybe it just reveals that 
nobody has bothered to fix it. 

Courtroom 4 reconvenes for the afternoon after those in "lock-up" 
downstairs have been brought up in shackles and placed inside a large 
cage next to the expressionless marble clock. Lock-up holds people 
transported from local prisons as well as last night's arrestees awaiting 
arraignment. The gallery fills up both with people who have business 
with the court and with spectators, mostly the friends and family of 
those in lock-up. The men in the cage try to catch glimpses of their 
loved ones by sranding on tiptoe and peering over a piece of plywood 
which has been put on one side of the cage to prevent visual contact 
with the spectators in the gallery. The sheriff's deputy doesn't see~ to 
mind that throughout the whole session three men in the cage Stram to 
see over the board, knuckles turning white as they pull themselves up 
against the cage and silently mouth words in English or Spanish to their 
family and friends. The plywood obscures each man's lower lip so that 
APRIL 18, 1997 
the meaning of his words is lost. 

Kaplan calls one of his clients over to the corner of the cage, and 
with the aid of a Spanish translator, discusses the man's case. When the 
case is called, the sheriff's deputy unlocks the cage so he can approach 
the bench with the shuffiing half steps his shackles allow. Kaplan walks 
up to join him before the judge and has the man sign forms verifying 
that he is indigent, that he wants Kaplan to represent him as his public 
defender, and that he'll pay the $25 fee Connecticut law requires for 
public defender representation. 

The prosecutor informs the judge of the specifics of the case. 
Kaplan's client was charged with drug possession after the police arrest-
ed him and two others who were driving in a car containing more than 
200 packets of marijuana. Evidence in the car indicated that the drugs 
belonged to the other two men. Afrer a brief discussion of the case by 
Kaplan, the judge, and the prosecutor, the man enters a guilty plea to a 
lesser count than the one he was initially charged with. Before accepting 
the plea, the judge, through the translator, asks the man two questions: 
"Have you had enough time to talk to your lawyer about your plea?" 
and "Are you satisfied with your lawyer's representation of you?" The 
man nods to both questions and then shuffies alongside the deputy 
back downstairs to lock-up. 

The CCLU claims that cases like these, which only occupy about 
five minutes of the court's time, represent much of what is wrong with 
the public defender system. Kaplan's high caseload kept him from visit-
ing this client while he was in prison. The environment of the court-
house has no space for Kaplan and his client to talk privately. No expert 
witnesses or investigative reports were used to analyze the evidence. 
And the defendant pleaded guilry without a mention by anyone in the

courtroom of taking the case to trial. 

The CCLU blames these shortcomings 
on the state's stingy budgeting. They point 
out that in 1994, Connecticut spent only 
$156 per public defense case, ranking the 
state 45th in the nation. In a letter to the Con~ 
necticut Law Tribune, CCLU lawyers wrote, 
"Having little, if any, confidence in their legal 
· representatives and a limited understanding of 
the. proceedings, many clients plead guilty, 
even if they are innocent or have valid defens~ 
es. " 

On some counts, the CCLU assessment is 
undoubtedly correct. Like the entire court~ 
house, the public defender facilities desperate~ 
ly need the improvements that increased 
funding could bring. In Kaplan's office lead 
paint peels from the window frames and 
pigeon feces, caked on the skylight, block out 
the sun. Kaplan acknowledges that he would 
like to meet with his clients more than he cur~ 
rencly can. "Because our office is so small, we 
have to work efficiently," he says, ')\nd that's 
meant sacrificing a sweet bedside manner 
with our clients in order to be lawyers." 

But Kaplan doesn't agree with the 
CCLU's position that the profusion of plea 
bargaining means that justice isn't being 
served. "Trials aren't going forward any~ 
where," he says: "If creative, hon~t lawyers of 
integrity can reach a just result without a: trial, 
then I think that's a good thing. In real life, as 
opposed to TY, trials tax a lot of resources and 
trials also tend to reach unpredictable results. 
From a practical point of view, a trial would 
seriously hurt this office by tying up an attor~ 
ney and our one investigator for a few weeks." 

For these reasons, among the thousands of 
cases Kaplan's office has handled in the past 
six years, only one has gone to trial.

In order to dramatize their claims, the 
CCLU has employed anecdotal evidence both 
in the complaint and, subsequently, in the 
press. One of their motions cites the case of a 
defendant who pled guilty because his public 
defender didn't have the time or resources to 
uncover the fact that he had been classified as 
mentally retarded. In their letter to the Con~ 
necticut Law Tribune, CCLU attorneys 
referred to three public defender clients and 
the wrongs that they'd suffered because of the 
shortcomings of their council. In two of the 
cases mentioned, the public defenders were 
depicted as bad attorneys who didn't care 
about the particulars of their clients' cases and 
forced them into guilty pleas and harsh sen~ 
tences in the interest of expediency. 

While the CCLU makes it clear that these 
are only the most extreme cases, their 
methodology reveals the paradox that all pub~ 
lie defenders must negotiate. Before the suit 
was filed, Smyth, the chief public defender, 
had perennially lobbied the state for increased 
funding, repeatedly pointing to the high case~ 
loads of the public defenders working under 
him. Smyth doesn't deny that more funding 
.would help, but he also claims that public 
defense across the state is more than adequate. 
"Our public defenders are specialists in crimi~ 
nallaw," said Smyth. "Because of the volume 
that we handle, to ·get through the day, you 
have to take shortcuts. But shortcuts don't 
necessarily mean short~change." 

The state Attorney General's office, which 
is representing the defendants in the suit, 
agrees with Smyth's assessment. After the law~ 
suit was filed in January 1995, the state 
entered a motion to dismiss the case. In 
response to that motion, the CCLU presented 
the court with more details for the suit, 
responding directly to some of the state's 
claims. The CCLU succeede9 when, in Octo~ 
ber 1996, the motion to dismiss was rejected 
by Connecticut Superior Court Justice Dou~ 
glas S. Lavine, who was specially assigned to 
handle the entire case. Lavine wrote that the 
determination of the constitutional questions 
in the suit is "manifestly in the public's inter~ 
est" and he set the trial date for June 1998. 

Despite the rejection of their motion, the 
state does have some powerful arguments in 
its favor. Smyth points out that public defend~ 
ers are an experienced group--averaging more 
than ten years apiece at the job-and he 
claims their familiarity with the various 
options available to defendants allows them to 
handle larger caseloads than one might 
expect. Smyth also feels that the CCLU's 
claim of inadequate expert resources is entire~ 
ly unfounded because it ignores a $600,000 
fund which public defenders can draw upon 
to pay witnesses. According to Smyth, no rea-
sonable application for these funds is ever 
denied, and there is a legislative provision to 
cover approved expert expenses if the 
$600,000 budget is ever exhausted. 

The state also points out that public 
defenders only handle 50 percent of the crim-
inal cases in Connecticut's courts, while the 
other half are dealt with by private defense 
attorneys. Yet the state's prosecutors, who 
handle 1 00 percent of cases, receive a budget 
comparable to that of the public defenders. In 
response, the CCLU has tried to differentiate 
between criminal prosecution and criminal 
defense by pointing out that while prosecu-
tors can always call upon a state official or 
police officer to testify, defense lawyers have to 
pay for everything from expert witnesses to 
psychological testing. Kaplan notes, "(Public 
defenders) have nothing but the resources of 
indigent clients who are facing jail." 

Kaplan also emphasizes that the stakes are 
higher for those who defend the accused. 
"We're personally, morally, and legally respon-
sible for defending a'person, while a prosecu-
tor has no client or personal accountability. 
We represent a person while they represent a 
case." It's the nature of our judicial process 
that defending the accused is almost always 
more costly than prosecuting·them. Prosecu-
tors only need to fit an incljvidual's act into 
the legal definition of a crime, while defenders 
must take into account an entire individual in 
order to demonstrate to the court why such a 
person does not fit into that criminal category. 

The nuanced merits of this argument, 
however, aren't likely to convince politicians 
elected on get~tough~on~crime platforms that 
Connecticut needs a berter public defender 
system. Over the last ten years the number of 
cases handled by public defenders has 
increased by 40 percent but staff increases 
have not kept pace. In the stagnant judicial 
system, any change, including something as 
simple as putting hands on a dock comes 
about slowly. Smyth's years of lobbying for 
increased funding have had little effect. 

It's surprising then that, even while it is 
still pending, Rivera v. Rowland seems to have
