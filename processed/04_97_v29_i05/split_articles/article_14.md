EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The Lower Chapel shopping district currently marks a distinct town-gown division. 
The issue of the Omni Hotel itself is more 
complex. "The hotel will be beneficial only 
because there are jobs attached to it and then 
only if New Haven residents are hired to fill 
those jobs, not people from the outside," 
Poole remarks. "Residents must be given more 
than menial work." The construction of the 
Omni presents a conundrum for New Haven 
community leaders. On one hand, it offers 
the promise of jobs that are desperately needed. But even if residents do get work, what 
good will it do them if they have no place to 
buy clothes?


The main walkway of the Chapel 
Square Mall's first floor is flanked on 
one side by Radio Shack, the Athlete's 
Foot, and Burger King, and on the other by 
Rite Aid and an empty storefront. In the center of the walkway is a huge staircase, and 
close to that, a fountain where a number of 
black and Latino teenagers are sitting, eating, 
and talking loudly together. Security guards 
prowl from floor to floor, attempting to look 
severe in their faux police uniforms. Despite 
the trappings of authority, the guards are 
taunted by the loitering teenagers and their 
jabs clearly become challenges to the guards' 
control. Young women push strollers and drag 
waddling toddlers from store to store. 
On a display in Sam's Dollar Mart is the 
slogan, "Beautiful doesn't have to be expensive." If mall developers have their way, 
Chapel Square Mall will soon be both. There 
are almost 20 people in Sam's this morning, 
mostly women with small children, picking 
up everything from dish towels to greeting 
cards to sunglasses, most priced at $1 or less. 
There is one Yale student who tries not to be 
noticed. She creeps unobtrusively to the back 
of the store to price imitation Tupperware, as 
if she doesn't want anyone to catch her shopping in a 99Â¢ store.


Across the main walkway from Sam's is 
Pat Santino's shop, VideoTek. At 10 a.m., the 
store is empty. T-shirts hang on the walls with 
airbrushed pictures of 2Pac and Bob Marley 
emblazoned across them. On a shelf above the 
counter sit samples of the plaques that Santino 
makes for funerals and weddings. These 
plaques, complete with photo and poem, 
mourn those who have died and celebrate 
marriages. Santino, dressed casually in denim 
and cotton, talks on the phone, fiddles with a 
camera, and rearranges a shelf all at once. As a 
young black family enters Santino's store, his 
attention shifts to them. Santino leans across 
the counter and says thoughtfully, "We, the 
tenants here, don't know anything about 
what's going on, but I feel like there has to be 
a comfortable medium. This mall needs to be 
both safe and affordable." He implies that 
although the mall now provides an inexpensive 
shopping option for local residents, it has 
a crime problem that cannot be overlooked. 
The high school kids who hang out in the 
mall during the day, instead of attending 
school, leave retailers feeling anxious and 
shoppers feeling threatened.


In Just For You, a clothing and electronics 
store at the front of the mall, a woman comes 
in with two little boys to look at shoes. She 
picks up a pair of bright orange patent leather 
mules, turns to manager Richard Estrada, 
who is standing behind the counter, and asks, 
"D'you got these in a ten?" Estrada sends 
another woman to the back of the store to 
search for the size as the customer waits and 
her children play among the racks of clothing, 
chasing each other and pretending to shoot 
the mannequins. Estrada describes the mall 
simply: "It's all about safety. Yale students are 
afraid to come down here to do their shopping." Yalies are unlikely to shop at the mall 
except to dress up for Halloween and theme 
parties. Since the departure of the stores that 
attracted Yalies to the Chapel Square Mall, 
like B. Dalton, the Pack Plaza Hotel, and 
Macy's department store, Yalies rarely stray to 
Lower Chapel to fulfill their shopping needs. 
An increase in crime may very well be the key 
issue behind the dramatic shift in clientele 
that the mall has experienced in the past few 
years. Inner-city residents currently make up 
65 percent of the mall's shoppers. 
Community activists, undoubtedly aware 
of the safety problem, nevertheless feel that it's 
important to serve New Haven's permanent 
residents. The merchants, whose obvious 
interests should make them favor keeping the 
mall in its current state, believe that their 
business opportunities are being limited, in 
part, by the very customers they attract. 
In the end, the players in the Chapel 
Square drama go on telling themselves fairy 
tales. The Yale administration tells itself that 
there is no issue. The city of New Haven tells 
itself that urban development is being done in 
the name of positive economic change. Community activists tell themselves that the mall is 
ideal as it is. The retailers are perhaps the only 
ones telling themselves the truth.


An hour later, the cashier at Sam's Dollar 
Mart is still busily ringing up purchases while in 
Just For You two teenage girls rummage through 
racks of dresses. One holds up a striped dress, the 
other a tiger print. Pat Santino is again leaning 
across the counter, gesturing towards the T-shirts 
and quoting prices to one of his customers. At 
the front doors of the mall, steps away from 
Radio Shack, a destitute man begs for loose 
change so that he'll be able to afford a meal in 
the food court. A block away from Chapel 
Square, well-dressed Yalies mill about in Ann 
Taylor trying on silk shirts and business suits. 
On the next corner hungry students indulge 
in $6 bean and cheese burritos at Claire's. 
Leaving Chapel Square Mall and returning 
to Yale is like moving from one world to 
another. Karl Kani is replaced by Karan couture 
and the faces change dramatically from 
black to white in a matter of blocks. While a 
homeless New Haven resident wonders if he 
will be able to afford a meal at Burger King, 
urban developers insist that it is in the entire 
community's best interest for the mall's retailers 
to sell more expensive goods. 
... And the battle waged on. In the end there 
stood no victors--only questions and very few 
answers. All of the royal members of the court 
were talking, as were the dissatisfied citizens, but 
neither side was listening to the other. The 
Chapel Square Mall battlefield was war-torn 
and ravaged. The valiant retailers who hung on 
until the finish could only wait under the pall of 
death, expecting the dragon's fiery breath to separate them from their stores at any moment. They 
knew that one day soon this death sentence would 
be served, and perhaps someone, somewhere, was 
living happily ever after. The End.
