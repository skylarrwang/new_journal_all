**Title: The Magical Mall of Make Believe**

Once upon a time there was a mall that sat near a square with a chapel 
on it, sroeral chapels in fact. The rqyal bureaucrats in a nearby office bui~ 
ing decided to call it the Chapel Square MalL For some time it remained 
there, existing in 4 relativeLy unremarkable manner, but years later instabil-
ity reared its ugly head. The businesses in the mall alternately flourished and 
withered. Retailers came in and retailers pulled out. Corporations owned 
the mall and corporations disowned the mall There were periods of famine 
and there were periods of abundance. These fluctuations damaged the pub-
lic image of the rqyal bureaucrats and their court. 

Across the lawn, behind the crawling ivy, there stood an ivory tower 
populated by wise men and women who were also disturbed by the lack of 
consistent prosperity at the mall The institution, Yale University, came to 
lead the battle to rroitalize the community which surrounded it. Their 
strate~they called it "urban develapment "-called for the reconstruction 
of this retail space. There were arguments and issues, supporters and dis-
senters, winners and lasers, an upperclass and an underclass. And this is 
how the struggle unfolded. .. 

N
ew Haven faces the particular challenge of being at once a 
depressed city and a university town. The city is forced to 
reconcile the conflicting needs of its permanent residents 
with those of the students who reside in the city only for 
the school year. The town-gown tension intrinsic to the Yale experience 
is one result of the struggle for space and resources in which these two 
groups engage. One of the current battlefields of this struggle is the 
Chapel Square Mall. 

The retailers currently established in Chapel Square Mall-stores 
like Hair Braiding Heaven, Nails Plus, Cross Flava Records, Chapel 
Discount, and a host of other small businesses catering to the urban 
shopper-reflect the needs of the permanent residents, as opposed to 
the stores of Upper Chapel whose produCts and prices are tailored to 
the college community's checkbooks. This may soon change. 

A sign in a window display at Chapel Square Mall reads: 
BUILDING A UVABLE NEW HAVEN 
OMNI NEW HAVEN HOTEL AT YALE 
OPENING FALL 1997 

Mayor John DeStefano wants to attract fashionable retail stores to 
the Chapel Square Mall as part of his three-pronged development plan: 
corporate activity in Nmth Square, retail activity at Long Wharf, and 
arts and entertainment downtown. According to his plan, instead of 
everyday clothing stores and nail salons, the mall beneath the hotel 
would house fashionable stores selling vases and fine jewelry, picture 
frames and designer clothing. When hotel patrons return from cultural 
excursions in the Elm City, DeStefano hopes they will stroll through 
the mall's charming boutiques en route to the hotel lobby Boors above. 

Yale's administrators have expressed interest in seeing retail stores 
around the Green, but their vision of a retail future doesn't match the 
reality of the streets. As the city's most profitable tourist attraction and 
one of New Haven's largest employers, Yale plays a central role in the 
decision-making process of the Chamber of Commerce. 

The planning of a city and its retail space is driven by politics: racial 
politics, class politics, and social politics. Developers of the Omni Hotel 
sought to move the bus stops away from New Haven Green in order to 
reduce the number of bus riders waiting by the mall. Long Wharf, 
rather than downtown, has been earmarked for less specialized retail 
because of its highway access. The city wants to attract the spending 
base of the suburbs that it feels no longer comes downtown. Planners 
hope to snag potential shoppers whizzing down I-95 with the bait of 
brand-name stores like Marshall's and Filene's Basement. The artsy 
stores, like the ones currently on Upper Chapel, would carer to Omni 
and Schubert patrons (the more sophisticated suburbanites) as well as 
the Yale community. 

Community leaders question where the changes at the Chapel 
Square Mall leave economically disadvantaged New Haven residents. 
Across town, the Broadway scrip is also undergoing a period of drastic 
change in a shift towards national corporate retailers. Expectant Yalies 
await the completion of a Brueggers' Bagels eatery and the Starbucks-
run cafe within th~ new Barnes and Noble bookstore. The larger ques-
tion then becomes, should New Haven's downtown retail space belong 
to Yalies and day-tripping suburbanites or to its year-round residents? 

ew Haven's story is not a fairy tale. The reality is that 18.2 per-
cent of New Haven's families live below the poverty line, 45.4 
percent of New Haven's children live in single-parent house-
holds, and the median household income in 1990 was $25,811-less 
than a single year's tuition at Yale. The city is still ranked among the 
country's poorest, yet the urban development in the works means that 
many New Haven residents will not be able to afford to shop in their 
new-and-improved downtown. In shon, Yale's influence may simply be 
pushing New Haven and its residents further away from its ivory tower. 

Susan Godshall, Yale's representative to the Executive Committee 
of the Greater New Haven Chamber of Commerce and second-in-
command to University Secretary Linda Lorimer, doesn't think that the 
downtown development poses a problem. "The mall, currently, as a 
collection of stores, is haphazard," Godshall says. Haphazard, many 
would agree, but not unlike any other mall. It is distinct only because it 
operates on a different economic scale-the scores cater to those with 
smaller pocketbooks, those unable to afford typical mall fare. 

In essence, every mall is like an exploded Wal-Mart: a place where a 
family can fulfill all of its shopping needs, no matter how obscure. 
Chapel Square Mall has fast-food eateries, clothing and shoe scores, 
jewelers, a hair salon, a pharmacy, a music store, and a produce shop. 
Perhaps because Radio Shack isn't the Sharper Image and Rite Aid isn't 
Clinique, the retail composition of Chapel Square is labeled "haphaz-
ard." Godshall's voice hardens and assumes an exasperated tone as she 
discusses what she considers the non-issue of the Chapel Square Mall. 
''I'm not sure that New Haven residents have an entitlement to any par-
ticular turf." 

But some community leaders do believe residents of a city deserve a 
say in what goes on in their community. "The stores that will replace 
what's in the mall now certainly won't be catering to the minority com- , 
munity of New Haven," says Joyce Poole, president of New Haven's 2 
African-American Women's Agenda and a former city alderman. She ~ 
voices the community's concerns over the removal of the more afford- ~ 
able retailers that currently inhabit the mall. "New Haven is quicldy ~ 
becoming a city divided along economic lines," Poole says. Her obser- ~Â­
vation points to the heart of the issue. There is a community of color ~ 
that lives in New Haven. It is largely poor and does not feel connected ~ 
to or noticed by its elecred leaders or the instirutions that hold the reins ~ 
of money and power in the city. Instead of representing their con- ~ 
stiruents within New Haven, some feel New Haven's leaders are cater- r:: 3 
ing to a wealthier white suburban community outside the city.
