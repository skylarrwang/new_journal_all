While spending a semester abroad in Nepal, Katryna 
Nields's foreign language teacher asked her what she 
wanted to do for a living. She asked him the word for 
"lawyer." Her teacher protested, "That doesn't make 
any sense." Katryna had spent the last few months playing and listening 
to Nepalese music. "You're going to be a musician," he said. 
"Yeah, you're right," Katryna thought to herself, and quickly wrote 
her older sister Nerissa a letter about her change of heart: after her graduation from Trinity College she would take her sister up on the idea of 
forming a band. This was one of the first steps the Nields took toward 
becoming a three-Nields, three-Dave, five-person folk rock band. 
Nerissa Nields (SM '89) sits in the WWUH-FM radio station at 
the University of Hartford. Surrounded by shelves full of records, Nerissa crosses her legs carefully, adjusting her big, blue walking cast. 
Although the foot she broke two and a half weeks ago prevents her 
from helping the rest of the band as they set up for their concert, Nerissa manages the clunky cast easily, as if every rock star wore a navy blue 
orthopedic shoe with her snakeskin jacket and zippered lycra pants. 
"When you're at Yale, freshman year is when you get your bearings and 
you sort of feel like nothing quite belongs to you. I was in Silliman, you 
know, we were the youngest kids in the college and nothing was really 
ours. So by sophomore year we were beginning to get a sense we could 
actually do something that could make a difference." 
As a sophomore at Yale, Nerissa began a folk group called Tangled 
Up in Blue (T.U.I.B.) to sing the Bob Dylan and Peter, Paul, and Mary 
songs her family had enjoyed around the dinner table. "The guitar was 
a constant sixth member of the family," Abigail Nields (DC '96)-who 
continued the T.U.I.B. tradition-reminisces about her family's folky 
tendencies. T.U.I.B. started out as an informal group of Nerissa's 
friends, meeting every so often to hang out and play music for fun. 
"I brought my guitar and we sat around and sort of made up 
arrangements," Nerissa says. "I was studying music so I had learned 
how to write music notation. There was always, from the very beginning, a great spirit-it was fun and loose, but at the same time everybody was musical enough to care about sounding good." It didn't take 
T.U.I.B. long to get its first gig. 
"Somebody in Branford College asked us to come and do a show. 
She'd started a little coffeehouse called Fred's." They were the only 
singing group on campus to use instruments: guitar, mandolin, sitar, 
and tin whistles. T.U.I.B. showed the singing group scene that good 
music doesn't have to be performed a cappella. Nor does it need to be 
performed in tuxedos and gowns; flannel and India cotton do just as 
well. "There was this great feeling of 'We're doing this ourselves'," Ner-
issa remembers, "'We're doing something new and different. It's all 
ours. ..." 
By Nerissa's senior year, the folk group had firmly established itself 
on campus. More people came out for T.U.I.B. auditions than for 
many of Yale's other singing groups. Nerissa's experience with T.U.I.B. 
encouraged her as a singer/songwriter. 
"I started writing seriously at the end of my sophomore year, but I 
was so shy about my songs that it took until March of my junior year 
when we were on tour in Washington, DC, for me to even play them 
for any of the people in the group. I remember so dearly playing one of 
my first songs and the warmth of the response that they gave me told 
me that I should really be doing this." 


The first word Katryna Nields uses to describe her older sister is 
"strong." "Nerissa's really the person that's in the center, making 
sure that everything's okay all the time. She's a trooper." 
The story of Nerissa's fractured foot, Katryna says, illustrates her sister's fighting spirit. Before The Nields' February 13 show in Charleston, 
South Carolina the band was attempting to maneuver around a monitor to get to the dark stage when Nerissa fell three and a half feet off the 
edge, injuring her foot. Someone offered her a chair for the performance, but she stood on one foot through the entire show. Only after 
the band had finished for the night did she admit that the bone was 
probably broken and ask to go to the hospital. 
"It must have hurt like hell," Katryna says. "But that's why I call her 
strong." Although behind the scenes she is a leader, when Nerissa performs she stands off to one side. 
Center stage at the University of Hartford, Katryna swings her 
long, brown hair over her shoulders. She wears a black and white psychedelic print shirt. "This is a nice little love rune," she announces. The 
band opens into "Fountain of Youth," a bass-driven tune about a love 
affair gone sour. Katryna picks up a fish-shaped wooden instrument, a 
guiro-which the album credits calls a "Scratchy Fishie"-and scrapes 
a stick up and down its corrugated stomach keeping time as she dances 
around the stage. To her right, David Nields plays the guitar. When he 
married Nerissa, he changed his name from David Jones because, as he 
says, in the music industry you don't want to be confused with a Monkee. 
David was pursuing his master's degree in theater studies when a 
mutual friend introduced him to Nerissa. The summer after she graduated from Yale, David and Katryna both accompanied Nerissa on 
T.U.I.B.'s cross-country tour from New Haven to California and back. 
In Elkins, West Virginia, on one of the tour's final stops, Nerissa and
