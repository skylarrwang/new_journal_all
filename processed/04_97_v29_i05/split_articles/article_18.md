brought about some posmve changes. In 
1995, when the suit was filed, almost none of 
the public defender offices had access to com-
puters. Since then, a capital appropriations 
committee has provided funds to equip all the 
public defender offices with computers and a 
Cast Bast CD-ROM for research purposes. 
The suit also pointed out a lack of communi-
cation between public defenders at different 
levels of the system, but many of those organi-
zational concerns have also been dealt with. 
Smyth is cooyinced that though difficulties 
persist, the system is working. "We have 
addressed some of the things in the com-
plaint," says Smyth, "not just because they're 
in the complaint, but because we've wanted to 
change these things for years. It just took us a 
while to get the funding." 


The CCLU may have already managed to 
increase the budget of Smyth's department. 
Governor Rowland's proposed budget for 
1997-98 contained few surprises; the budget-
cutting Republican slashed state expenditures 
almost across the board. Connecticut's judicial 
branch is slated to receive $5 million less than 
the amount required to ma.t.'ltain services at 
their current level, and the amount allotted for 
criminal justice prosecution dropped by over 
$1 million. Yet amidst all these cutbacks, and a 
political climate that favors punishment, the 
public defender department received a 3.8 per-
cent boost to keep pace with inflation. 


Meanwhile, both sides in the lawsuit are 
interviewing witnesses and preparing materi-
als for the 1998 Rivtra v. Rowland trial date. 
The most recent development in the case 
came in Jariuary when Justice Lavine refused a 
motion by the state that would have prevent-
ed the CCLU from talking to any public 
defender. The Attorney General's Office had 
argued that because the CCLU was suing the 
Public Defender Services Commission, all 
public defenders were party to the lawsuit and 
therefore were ineligible to provide informa-
tion to the CCLU. Though Lavine rejected 
this broad motion, he did issue a protective 
order to prevent the CCLU from speaking to 
top managerial people in the public defenders 
system. A further bearing, not yet held, will 
determine if the CCLU can speak to interme-
diate managers like Kaplan. 


The debate over whether public defenders 
are party to the suit exposes the difficult posi-
tion that public defenders have found them-
selves in. "If the outcome of the lawsuit results 
in increased staff and increased resources for ~ 
0 
our department, then it is favorable for us and o 
our clients," Smyth says. "But our method has ~ 
been to request these things through the nor- ~ 
mal political procedures. Was a lawsuit neces- ~ 
sary to get them? I don't know." 


Kaplan, who is more supportive of the ~ 
CCLU suit, has found a tenuous position for ~ 
himsel£ "There is a common ground where I ; 
can say that I do provide adequate representa- a-
cion for my clients but only at a tremendous § 
toll to myself and my staff," Kaplan explains. !!!. 
"It seems to me that there's much more room 
for agreement on how w address these under-
lying problems. The aim of the lawsuit, as I 
understand it, is to define and put parameters 
on what the problems are. The solution isn't 
to deny that the problems exist or say that 
they're manageable." 


From Rowland's perspective, "the solu-
tion" may be to boost the public defender 
budget just enough to neutralize the CCLU's 
main complaint-underfunding. Whether 
this is a tacit acknowledgment that the public 
defender office has been underfunded for 
years, or just a sign that Rowland doesn't like 
being sued, remains unclear. The true mea-
sure of Rivtra v. Rowland's success will be if it 
manages to bring about any lasting change in 
Connecticut's public defender system. 


Some of those who know the system best 
remain skeptical. One day outside of Court-
room 4, a man charged with assault for get-
ting in a fight with a co-worker waits for his 
case to be called. He approaches Kaplan to ask 
the time and then jokes, "I think I'm going ro 
become a lawyer. I'm here a lot anyway." 
Kaplan, half-jokingly replies with the advice 
of someone who's already familiar with the ail-
ing system: "Become a doctor."
