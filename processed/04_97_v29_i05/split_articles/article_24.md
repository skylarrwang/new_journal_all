EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
a small, plain brown clapboard house perched 
on it. There was a dock in the distance, with 
one lone white pine in front of it. 

The lake was flat, except for occasional 
ripples as fish broke the surface. I could pic-
cure the lake coming alive with feeding trout. 
Haines started carrying equipment down the 
hill to the dock and I followed hlm. On the 
second trip, I asked if he wanted me to carry 
the battery, but he had already grabbed it and 
was straining down the hill with it. I followed 
with his tackle box in a whlte bucket and the 
electric trolling motor. 

The lawn was soggy and smelled like 
spring. "Thls house belongs to my friend Red 
Wagner," Haines said. 
"He like to fish?" I asked. 
"Yeah, but he don't get out as much as he 
used to. He's fading a bit, getting old." 

I followed Haines to the edge of the prop-
erty, where there was an aluminum boat up 
on wooden sawhorses. We lifted it, turned it 
right side up, and carried it down the sloping 
lawn, sliding it into the water. Tiling the 
bowline, Haines led the boat to the dock and 
tied it up, and we filled it with our gear. He 
walked to a nearby shed and pulled out his 
key chain, which must have had 30 keys on it. 
He released the padlock and then 6Wllng open 
the door. Inside, we grabbed two seat cush-
ions, a pair of oars, and two orange badges 
with pins. 

"This is a backpatch," he said, holding a 
piece of orange paper, "which says you're a 
guest at the Newtown Fish and Game Club. 
You can thank old Red for that when you 
meet him." Now I was legal, I thought, and 
somehow, a new member of the club. After 
all, he wanted to introduce me to his old 
friend. I had been wondering if thls was a 
one-cime thing, but it seemed that Haines 
already had plans to take me fishing again. 

We got in the aluminum boat and pushed 
off. Haines clamped his small electric trolling 
motor to the stern and then rowed us out. 
"Oh," he said as he was putting his two-
piece fishing rod together, "I met your friend 
Stephen's mother the other day at Greiser's 
_,., store." When Haines came upon us fishing, 
~ Stephen attempted, unsuccessfuUy, to run 
Â£ away. "Boy, is she proud of her son. She said 
~ to me, 'You won't catch my Stephen again; he 
~ can sprint like a deer and swim like an otter.' 
~ 

I couldn't help but laugh; this was typical 
~ of her. Haines concinued, "And I said to her, 
'Ma'am, your Stephen can swim, but he's got 
to come to the other side at some point.' She 
shut up for a while, and then she insisted that 
she was my classmate down in Bridgepon, 
but I never went to the school she was talking 
about." He dipped the oar in the water and 
stroked and then stopped to hook up the 
trolling motor to the battery. 

"Stephen's mom means well," I said. 
"When did she think she knew you?" Haines 
strung the line through his guides and select-
ed a fly. 

"I guess grammar school. I never liked 
school that much," Haines said. "I had to 
make money, my teachers never understood 
that. Trapping was how I made most of my 
money as a kid." 

"What kind of stuff did you trap?" 

"Muskrat mostly. Occasionally I'd get a 
mink and get a load of money for it. Trapped 
a few fox. But the compecition started getting 
stiff, guys were overlapping my territory, and 
eventually I stopped. There were very few 
houses north of your house in the Tashua area 
back then. I could walk through th~ woods 
from my house to the Merritt Parkway and 
hunt squirrels all day. I had it all to myself" 

I watched Haines rig up hls rod. 

"Ever use lead-core line?" he asked, hold-
ing up the rod. 
"No." 
"Well, the line is heavy and it gees the fly 
down if the fish are deep." He cied the fly to 
the line and laid it in the water. Starting the

engine again, he let out about thirty feet of 
line. "Why don't you get out your fly rod and 
tie on something about two inches long," 
Haines said. I put a fly on my line and let out 
as much line as he had. "Your line should be 
closer to the surface than mine," he said. 
"That way we can cover more water." 

Haines put his rod in a holder by the edge 
of the boat so he could steer the engine. It was 
the first time this year I'd noticed the sun was 
getting higher .in the sky. The shadows were 
strong. We'd [rolled about three hundred 
yards before anything happened. 

"I think I had a bite," I said, holding my 
fly rod in my hand. 
"Does it feel like a good fish?" Haines 
asked. 
"I can't tell," I said, and then 1 felt it jerk 
again. "There he is again." 
"He gave you a second chance." 
"Yeah, he's on now." I reeled the fish up to 
the boat with ease. It wasn't a trout, which is 
what I was expecting. It was a largemouth 
bass. 

"Mudsucker," Haines said as he netted it. 
"Mudsucker?" 
"Yeah, them bass aren't good for anything. 
People go nuts over 'em but I don't see what 
the big deal is; they make one effort to fight, 
then they give up. And if you eat them in the 
summer they taste like mud. The only time of 
year they're any good to eat is in winter, when 
you catch them through the ice and their flesh 
is good and firm." 

"Bass are what I mostly fished for all my 
life," I said to Haines. "I think they fight 
well." 
"Well, they don't fight like a trout, and 
they don't taste near as good. Oop, there's 
one," he said, hooking a fish and reeling in his 
line. I let the bass go and then netted his fish, 
a lovely little yellow perch with bright orange 
lower fins, a yellow-green body, and dark ver-
tical bands along its sides. 

"Barred trout," Haines said. 
"Barred trout? Don't you mean yellow 
perch?" I asked him. 
"Barred trout are better than bass. They've 
got real nice white meat that flakes off when 
you cook it. This one's too small," Haines 
said, tossing it back into the dark water. 

"That was a perch," I said to Haines, try-
ing one more time, "right?" 
"Barred trout," he said. 
"Okay," I murmured. I soon learned that 
Hrunes had his own particular way of naming 
things.
