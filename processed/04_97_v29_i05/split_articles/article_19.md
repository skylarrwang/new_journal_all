he innocuous green and ye!low Victorian house at 1302 
Chapel Street gives no sign of its recent role in a neighbor-
hood controversy. Nor is there any visible sign on its across-
the-meet neighbor, 1303 Chapel, which might reveal the 
tumult of its occupants' history. This is fitting, since Elsie Cofield, 
founder and president of the AIDS care organization housed at 1303, is 
trying to put the past behind her. She does not dwell on the conflict 
that ultimately split her organization-the AIDS Interfaith Network 
(AI)-from its former parmer-parent organization AIDS Project New 
Haven (APNH). 


Cofield has not, however, forgotten the past. She is, in fact, the only 
party to the conflict who was present at the beginning. And she has 
kept a careful record: of the paternalistic treatment of AIDS Inter-
faith-which traditionally serves blacks-by the traditionally white and 
gay-oriented APNH; of the persistent understaffing of the organization, 
of APNH's abrupt curtailment of their parmership; of the difficulty she 
had in re~tablishing her organization independently; and, finally, of 
the unannounced change of address which brought APNH right onto 
her hard-won territory in the Dwight neigborhood. 


All this memory is stored in a black leather bag, in the form of let-
ters and newspaper clippings. Cofield maneuvers through her big, clut-
tered office to return with her "bag of history." She expresses her uneasi-
ness with the decisions of APNH by collecting and remembering, but 
resists becoming mired in conflict. She has stopped attending the 
demonstrations and vigils organized by black community leaders from 
outside AI who object to the racial disrespect they see in APNH's treat-
ment of Al-
most recently, in the relocation of APNH to 1302 
Chapel. 


The protesters are concerned that APNH intends to displace AI, 
and to replace the self-sufficient black organization with a white charity. 
Despite the fact that APNH now serves black, white, and Latino clients 
in equal numbers, some vocal members of the black community still 
identify it with the gay, white community from which it was born. This 
misconception is perpetuated by APNH lore: it was New Haven's first 
public response to the epidemic, after a conversation in a gay bar in 
1983 prompted its foundation. 


Sources at both organizations confirm that their clients are mostly 
addicts, both women and men. The guidelines for providing care are 
not drawn on the basis of gender or sexual orientation, or even race, 
though AI still serves mostly black clients. Nonetheless, the protesters 
see APNH's move as motivated by competition for grant money, 
clients, and power. 


Cofield digs into the leather bag. As she rummages, she recalls the 
beginning of her involvement with the fight against AIDS. In 
1987 Cofield was three weeks from retirement afrer a 31-year 
career as a public school teacher when a black Yale Divinity School stu-
dent approached her. Allison Moore (DIY '90) asked for Cofield's help 
in developing a program aimed specifically at helping African Ameri-
cans infected with HIY. Cofield is a religious woman, married to Dr. 
Curtis Cofield, the prominent minister of the Immanuel Baptist 
Church; she meditated and prayed on the request for three weeks. At 
the end of that time, she told Moore that fighting AIDS was her calling 
from God. She wears a pin on her colorful sweater that reads, "If you 
believe AIDS is a plague from God, you haven't met my God." 


AI got its initial financial support from APNH, and spent its first 
four years under the patronage of the older organization. 'They gave us 
that first $12,000 just for the asking," Cofield said. APNH gave the 
money gladly. Alvin Novick, a Yale biology professor, one of the 
founders of APNH, said that APNH had been trying to help black 
New Haven help itself since 1984. '1\PNH didn't see itself as not serv-
ing minority clients," Novick recalled. But APNH soon recognized that 
the black HIV-positive community would be better served and feel 
more comfortable with an organization from within their own commu-
nity. The partnership with Cofield brought APNH closer to that goal. 


Cofield's association with Immanuel Baptist gave her the credibility 
within the African-American community that APNH lacked. She 
worked to minimize the black community's discomfort-her own 
included-with AIDS and homosexuality thar had crippled APNH in 
its efforts to reach black clients. Cofield took congregations by surprise, 
preparing them for a video on condom use with the reminder, "As you 
all know, I've been teaching the Bible for a long time, but tonight is
