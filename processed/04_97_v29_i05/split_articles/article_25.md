The "terrifying" tale of the BUG ROOM! 
by Alec Bemis 
Dear Mr. Craven, 
Boy, have J•got a movie for you. You're not gonna 
believe it, 'Wes. It has it all: a dashing hero, a prestigious 
American research university. and, get this, FLESH-
EATING BUGS! Best of all, the whole damn thing's 
~!Do yourself a favor and take a moment to go over 
my rough proposal I'd love to bring you in on the project. 
Yours truly,

Fade in: Newsroom of The New journal, New Haven, Connecticut. 
Synopsis: Establishing shot of hero, Alec Bemis, intrepid reporter for 
The New journal Alec chats with a fellow reponer about a possible 
story lead. They are discussing "the bug room." The reponer tells Alec 
that a colony of vicious flesh-eating insects is stored in the basement of . 
Yale's Peabody Museum and that, when hungry, the bugs can dean the 
flesh off a mid-sized animal in under a day. 
Alec immediately calls the Peabody to inquire about the bug room. 
The receptionist is entirely candid about the room's existence. Alec is 
invited for a "visit" on the upcoming Friday. As he puts down the 
receiver, his face tenses. He mutters to himself nervously, "What if this 
is how they take care of inquiring minds? What if I'm scheduled to be 
the next VICTIM OF THE FLESH-EATING BUGS?" 
"It's spring break," he says to himself, visibly calming. "There will 
be no distractions. It's the perfect time to break my big story and eradi-
cate this perversion of nature." [Triumphant, sexy orchestral score kicks in. 
Midway through, the tenor of the music shifts and becomes ominous as the 
screen fades to black} 
Cut to: Basement of the Peabody Museum. Construction sounds, drip-
ping water, and the hum of electric circuitry are audible. 
Synopsis: Alec, tape recorder in hand, walks through the labyrinthine 
corridors of the museum's basement. Next to him is Fred Sibley, collec-
tions manager for venebrate wology. Sibley wears a slighdy rumpled 
button-down shin, tan workpants, and black shoes splattered with a 
white powdery substance. His eyes are a dear, electric blue and his gray 
and white hair is balding in spots. Picture Sibley as a mad scientist type 
but cool and calm, almost too hospitable. The two men converse about 
the history of the bug room. [This bit is sort of boring, but it will clear up 
so~ niggling tktails for the audience.} 
Sibley shares some of the history of osteology-the study of bones. 
In the 1920s, Sibley tells Alec, a group of scientists at UC Berkeley dis-
covered that dermistid beedes eliminated the need to spend hours 
scrubbing down carcasses. The dermiscid survives by feasting on the 
flesh of dead animals. Scientists found that the beedes would e.fficiendy 
dean off mammal skulls or any other manner of ~ 
corpse. "Some people still use the older method," he o 
says. "You rot the animal, boil it, wait for the flesh to .!i 
rub off, and then scrub it gendy. You just lose a lot of ~ 
the little bones. That's why the dermiscids are really g' 
good on smaller birds." 
~· 
Alec asks if the dermistids really do eat animals ;! 
only bones in their wake. "They don't eat connective tis- ~ 
sue and they don't eat cartilage which is a good thing in a way," Sibley ~ 
says. "It means you have a lot of material left on a big skeleton." Alec ~ 
cringes. He wonders if there's much demand for bigger skeletons as Sib- ~ 
ley eyes his mid-sized frame. [Scene ends with the sound of screeching vio-
lins playing over an extreme close-up of Alec's terrified face.} 
Cut to: The bug room. T he sound of dripping water virtually drowns 
out conversation. Dingy metallic sinks are on full blast. A small labora-
tory oven is in the corner of the room. Skulls and bones covered with 
bits of DRIED AND ROTTEN FLESH litter the floor. 
Synopsis: Alec winces at the smell of rotting animal hides. Sibley, appar-
endy accustomed to the scent, is unfazed. "This would actually be 
called the prep room," he says. "That is the bug room." Sibley points to 
a door in the corner. Alec asks to get a look inside. 
As Sibley opens the door, releasing a harsh gust of rotten air, Alec 
grabs his nose, unable to cope with the stench. The bug room is about 
the size of a small walk-in closet. Thousands of pill-shaped inseCts 
weave their way through the sinewy flesh of various unfamiliar carrion. 
Alec is vulnerable and defenseless. He is BEETLE MEAT. His eyes go 
wide as pie plates staring at the carnage. 
Sibley speaks about the bug room with a kind of wild enthusiasm, a 
depraved relish. "In there right now is an emu, an ostrich, a great egret, 
a snowy egret, a red-tailed hawk, and a tuna head. All road kills or nat-
ural deaths. They've been in a long time because the heat is not right 
and a lot of the bugs have died. If the colony was really working the 
room would just be one mass of larvae. The floor would move and a 
bird skeleton would be cleaned in a day or two at most. Individual bee-
tles work very, very slowly chewing off that flesh. In these conditions it 
could take a month." 
Alec confronts Sibley. He asks if the bugs are a threat to living, 
breathing creatures-perhaps to people? Do they savor FRESH 
MEAT? Alec is determined to get to the bottom of Sibley's devious 
plans. 
"Oh, no they're not going to do anything to a living or breathing 
animal," Sibley says. "They don't want anything wet or moist because 
they'll just drown in a damp environment." 
"Oh," our fearless hero says. "Cool."
