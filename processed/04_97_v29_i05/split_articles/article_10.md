To the Editor: 
I am writing to share with you my sincere 
disappointment regarding Gabriel Snyder's 
recent article (TN}, February 14, 1997, "The 
Two-Parry System"). 
I am the president of the Alpha Epsilon Pi 
fraternity at Yale; and I was offer ied by your 
inaccurate characterization of fra,ernities and 
their brothers. 
It is quite apparent from your uninspiring 
article that you are wholly unf.uniliar with fra-
ternities at Yale. Your lack of experience is 
betrayed by the stereotypical descriptions that 
you resorted to in describing fraternity broth-
ers at Yale. 
Alpha Epsilon Pi, like almost all Yale fra-
ternities, represents a strong brotherhood of 
men, the likes of which you are obviously 
quite unfamiliar. My brothers are my closest 
friends at Yale. We share common bonds; 
similar interests, goals, and desires. We have 
joined together in an effort to better our Yale 
experience, and we have succeeded. My frater-
nity, like most Yale Greek organizations, takes 
part in extensive philanthropy projects. We 
fundraise. We hold private social events. And 
yes, we occasionally hold a parry and open it 
to Yale undergrads. 
Parrying is not the central feature of our 
brotherhood. In the Fall 1996 ~emester, we 
have held a grand total of four parties open to 
the campus. That is not what AEPi is all 
about. 
Mr. Snyder, your article served only to 
perpetuate unwarranted stereotypes of frater-
nities. And each time such nonsense is pro-
pogated, it is invariably done by a person with 
a complete lack of understanding of brother-
hood. Such irresponsible journalism is ram-
pant; however, I have come to expect better 
from Tht Nw jqurnal
