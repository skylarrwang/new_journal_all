sonal stationery. When I had made sure that 
the corrections had been entered, I once again 
brought the letters back to the editors for 
review. Despite losing the chance to play 
beach volleyball, I managed to keep in shape 
running up and down the hallways of the Old 
Executive Office Building. 

During my stay at the OEOB, I was also 
called to do some very important work along-
side the members of the President's cabinet. 
While walking down the hall, I passed Vice 
President Gore on his way to a staff meeting. I 
smiled at him and he nodded back. Consider-Â· 
ing the Vice President's noted reticence, it was 
obvious how much he was trying to say with 
just that one movement of his neck. Maybe 
he had heard of my reputation as a valued 
member of the Presidential Letter Writing 
Team. 

My work with the presidential cabinet 
continued about two hours later, when I was 
called into a meeting with Donna Shalala, 
Secretary of Health and Human Services. 
Though all the other interns were there as 
well, and Secretary Shalala didn't acknowledge 
my raised hand during the question-and-
answer time, I knew how much my presence 
meant to her. 

But my work at the White House was not 
limited to high-profile decision making. I also 
had to remain (:ool under the pressure of sud-
den changes in the presidential schedule. The 
day after the President injured his knee, I sat 
in on a press briefing where Press Secretary 
Mike McCurry deflected questions about the 
President's injury. As the network news cam-
eramen slowly awakened from their sleep in 
the back of the room, McCurry duked it out 
with the reporters who, contrary to the 
impression given to CNN viewers, were prac-
tically on top of McCurry in the tiny press 
room. To get an idea of its acrual dimensions, 
a Yale student must look no further than her 
own dorm room. 

The reality is that in all likelihood, the 
press conference could have gone on without 
me. And, to be truthful, I wasn't exactly 
instrumental in the Clinton machine. But the 
externship was a political aspirant's dream: I 
had the chance to see top officials up close 
and to get a glimpse of how the Wh.ite House 
runs. T hough my spring break didn't leave me 
golden-brown from the sun, I'm glad I got a 
chance to work there. Maybe some day I'll be 
back to live there, too.

**Title: A Stitch Through Time**
**Author: Daphna Rman**

In a room tucked away in the basement of 
Morse College, Mindy Goodfellow lectures 
on decreasing. Intense concentration meets 
meditative calm. The subject is not eco-
nomics and the students do not appear 
stressed or bored: Morsels are 
learning how to knit. 

Goodfellow, a veteran 
knitter, walks between 15 
casually situated students. 
Also traversing the room, 
Marcia Chambers, the 
Mistress of Morse Col-
lege, utters words of gen-
tle encouragement. 

Ten years ago, after 
putting down her pen 
as a full-time journal-
ist, with more time 
on her hands as a freelancer, Chambers picked 
up her needles and yarn and resumed knit-
ting. Concerned that knitting is an endan-
gered art form, Chambers recruited Goodfel-
low to revive the art among Morsels. 

Goodfellow notes that until recently, 
many women resisted needles and yarn in a 
conscious effort to escape archaic female 
stereotypes. At a time when women were try-
ing to liberate themselves from the confines of 
the home, women associated knitting with 
domesticity. 

Goodfellow's mother, sitting in on the 
class, agrees. "Knitting seems to come and go 
like waves over the years." But the class, which 
was received with plenty of enthusiasm, 
reveals that the popularity of knitting is now 
at high tide. 

Goodfellow learned to knit from her 
mother at age seven. She later took over her 
mother's knitting store, The Yankee Knitter, 
which shut down three years ago due to flag-
ging sales. When the store first opened, times 
were different. During World War II knitting 
at home was a family custom. In 1970, Good-
fellow's mother decided to combine her 
hobby with a search for independence from 
the home. While the knitting business has 
exhausted Goodfellow's mother, Goodfellow 
still speaks of knitting with an artist's passion. 
"Even if it's just a pair of mittens, I get excited." 

Such passion is infectious for students like 
Karen Abrecht (MC '00). She confesses that 
she has even taken her knitting into lec-
ture. "I only did it once," she 
assures, "but I got lots of funny 
looks." Here lies the greatest 
manifestation of knitting's evo-
lution: exchanging thoughts 
about Kant or modern China 
between stitches has replaced 
the exchange 
of recipes. 

Moreover, these women are 
joined in their new hobby 
by men. 

"In my generation you 
didn't really see men knit-
ters," 

Chambers 
recalls. 

"Men make very good knit-
ters if they get over the mas-
culinity problem." Scott Javor (MC '99) grins 
broadly as he shows off his first "cast on," the 
primary stage in the knitting process. Just a 
generation ago, men shyed away from the 
matronly image of knitting. Now they, too, 
find it relaxing and fun. 

Abrecht calls knitting "pleasantly mind-
numbing." She appreciates the way knitting 
allows her thoughts to wander. Chambers 
agrees. "It's like taking a nice walk." While 
finding the proper weather and time for a 
walk may be difficult, knitting provides a 
calming and productive alternative. 

Knitting only becomes relaxing, however, 
when the students realize that it is okay not to 
be perfect, Chambers explains. She assures a 
distressed woman that ripping out stitches 
builds character. Knitting, however, no longer 
defines one's character. That, Goodfellow 
comments, just might be why both women 
and men are beginning to take up the needle. 
"We enjoy doing it because we don't have to," 
Goodfellow says.
