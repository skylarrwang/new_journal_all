David decided to get married. 

While waiting to see whether Katryna would join the band, Nerissa taught English at The Madeira School in Maryland. After Kauyna graduated, the three relocated to Williamstown, Massachusetts, where David worked at a summer theater festival to support them. The sisters wrote music and worked the Williamstown restaurant scene, hoping for a break. 
"Katryna and I literally walked up and down Spring Street and knocked on the doors of any restaurant and said, 'Do you want to have live music? We'll play for free.' Most places said no." 

Little by little, the breaks came. The band began playing regularly as a trio at coffeehouses and open-mike nights. Although they found themselves allied with the local folk music groups, there was something about The Nields' music that separated them from the pack. "We were always a lot more energetic than other people on the circuit." David Nields says, "Even if we had stayed a trio I don't think we would have stayed in the folk scene." 

In 1994, two Daves-not-Nields transformed the band from a folk trio into a rock quintet. Dave Chalfant came on board to produce and play bass on the band's album Bob on the Ceiling. Dave Hower joined APRIL 18, 1997 the group at the same time to play percussion on five tracks. "Dave Hower and I bring sort of the noisy element to the band," Dave Chal-fant says. The two Daves-not-Nields' noisier influences include Pancera, Smashing Pumpkins, and Frank Zappa. 

The Nields have "gone electric" and moved from church halls and open-mike nights to national venues in the last six years, but the group still attracts audience members from ages five to 50. "The audience hasn't changed that much," Nerissa says, "It's just grown." 

At the University of Hartford show, fifty-something folkies sit side- by-side with Generation Xers and gum-chewing, Nields' T-shirt-wearing teens. Kevin Sullivan, a counselor and learning specialist at the University of Connecticut, watches the concert with his three daughters who are ages 13, 22, and 24. He has been following The Nields' career for about five years, since he heard them sing at a New Year's Eve show in Hartford. His daughters introduced him to their music, Sullivan says, but he has his own reasons for continuing to follow them. The Nields make him think of The Beagles. Like the legendary foursome, Sullivan says, "There's a simple perfection between their music and their words." 

This "simple perfection," a delicate balance between subject matter and presentation, is most apparent was The Nields perform. While
