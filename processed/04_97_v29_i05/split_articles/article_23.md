An Interview with James Prosek 
1NJ: What is the new book, joe 
and Me, about? 
Prosek: It's basically just 18 sto-
ries about this old guy Joe Haines, 
a game warden, who caught me 
fishing illegally when I was 14 
years old at the local reservoir. 
When he arrested me, or whatev-
er you do_.with a fishing criminal, 
he started.-taking me fishing. He's 
become a good friend. I think 
what happened was that his son 
had recently moved out to Col-
orado, and he was maybe five years older than me, and I kind of 
became a replacement. The book doesn't really rry to be anything. 
It's a very simple book. It's written very simply. There's 18 illustra-
tions that do their best to accentuate a particular moment in a 
story. 

1NJ: In virtually every review of Trout: An Illustrated History, 
reviewers either called you the "Audubon of fish" or said that the 
claims that you were the ":Audubon of fish" were overblown, but 
they all dealt with that issue. How do you react to that kind of 
comparison? 
Prosek: Well, I don't feel worthy. Especially since Audubon spent 
a lifetime with birds and didn't publish his works until he was at 
least, I don't know, 45. I'm 21 years old. Audubon was really the 
reason why I did a book like the trout book. As a kid, I started 
painting Audubon's birds or copying them. My dad would bring 
home Audubon's volumes of Birds of North America, which are 
these fantastically colorful bird drawings. So, to be compared with 
Audubon is very nice. I enjoy it more from a business perspective 
because I know that it's good for publicity. I know it's a good kind 
of line, but I don't really think you can compare Audubon to, 
well, I aon't know, anybody this century. 

TNJ: Most kids your age who want to write or do art for a living 
truck. 

"What, the turtle?" I asked him. "You eat turtles?" 

"Sure, but my freezer's packed with meat as it is. I got some heavy 
eating to do." He cleared his throat. 

"How would you eat a turtle?" I asked Haines. "Are they any 
good?" 

"Snappers have got sweet meat. I've got some friends that love 'em. 
I usually bring 'em to Danny Lee or Earl, and they prepare 'em and 
bring me a container with turtle soup. You could make a lot of soup 
from a turtle the size we just saw." 

"How big would you say that turtle was?" 

"Oh geez, that one'd go probably 40 pounds. Lots of meat on that 
one. I've cleaned them myself before but it takes a lot of work." 

"What do you have to do?" I asked. I had already figured out that 
APRIL 18, 1997 
think about doing a book sometime in the distant future. You 
have your second book coming out when you're 21, what do you 
want to be doing 20 years fromÂ·now? 
Prosek: Playing rock music. No, seriously, I'd very much like to 
write. I want to do a book on the trout of the rest of the world. 
I've been to Europe fishing for trout. I'd like to go to Japan and 
Siberia. And, there's a few trout in the first book from Mexico, but 
I think there could be some more exploration done down there 
along the west coast of Mexico and Baja. And I'd like to write 
some fiction. I have some stuff I'd like to write about, like murders 
in Baja. 

1NJ: Fishing stories? 
Prosek: It'd probably involve a fishing trip somewhere-a fishing 
trip gone bad. Also, I'd like to be known at some point as a rea-
sonable fine artist, canvas art or sculpture. I'm going to do more 
large canvas oil paintings. I'm interested in the line berween illus-
tration and fine art. But writing and painting are rwo things I'd 
still like to be doing in 20 years. 

TNJ: Do you want to be known as the "trout guy" or do you want 
to do work other than fishing? 
Prosek: If I do a second book, the trout of the world, it'll come 
out in the next five years, and then unless I'm terminated by forces 
beyond my control, I'm going to continue to produce other 
things. I'd like to be known eventually as more than a trout per-
son. The thing about being involved with trout all the time--
talking about it to you, answering whatever questions I can 
answer-is that I'm talking about something I enjoy so much that 
I'm sick of talking about it. Not that I'm sick of doing it, I love 
fishing and I always will. But, if for no other reason, I don't want 
to be the "trout boy" forever because I fear I run the risk of losing 
this passion which has been with me for my whole life and I hope 
will continue to be. But I'm perfectly fine if these rwo books are 
the only ones I ever publish. I will be very happy and satisfied, but 
I will be doing other things whether it's painting or architecture or 
whatever.
