I watched my mother's lean figure stride confidently ahead of me, 
impatiently waiting for her to answer my question. Distracted, she 
glanced at me over her shoulder. "What did you say?" Since my 
mother was· at least ten paces.ahead of me, our valiant attempts to 
communicate were repeatedly thwarted during our walk along a poorly' 
paved road in Serarnpore, India. Exasperated, I caught up beside her 
and managed to express my surprise at the vigilance of the fruit vendors 
over their wares. I had barely completed my thought before I was 
harassed by shrill rickshaw horns, temperamental cows and ·dogs, and 
uncompromising pedestrians, all attempting to weave through the 
crowded marketplace. My mother instinctively shoved me ahead of her. 
"One line!" she scolded, anxiety edging into her voice and tensing her 
body. 


During my travels to India this past winter break, the anarchic 
activity of the market overloaded my senses, leaving me virtually immo-
bilized. A stunning, sun-beaten woman in a tattered sari walked grace-
fully on the opposite side of the road with a straw basket balanced on 
the crown of her head; I attempted a friendly smile to justify my indis-
creet curiosity when she caught my eye. The tempting aroma of deep-
fried snacks mingled with the offensive stench of feces, but the oppres-
sive smog formed a layer of grit in my mouth which overpowered both. 
A five-year-old boy carrying an inf.uu stood at a busy intersection in 
front of me. He cupped his hands, staring through me with a chilling 
combination of pride and desperation. 


That little boy was omnipresent-sometimes I shelled out rupees 
from the neatly sewn pockets of my Calvin Klein jeans to fill his tiny 
hands, other times I smiled at him apologetically. Sometimes I cried 
quietly, other times I inhaled the polluted air and continued toward a 
jewelry dealer or sari boutique. Invariably, I was physically and emo-
tionally taxed by the time darkness cast a pathetic veil over my five-
year-old friend-by the time I was safely indoors. 


Five years had passed since my family and I had last visited our 
extended family in India, and we all noticed the changes that had 
occurred in that short time. My mother asked beneath her breath, 
"Hamara desh ko kya ho gaya?" What has happened to our country? 
"Hai bhagwan," she whispered, calling to God for an answer. 


Our? I flinched with surprise at her choice of pronoun, and stole a 
sidelong glance at my sister. Our? 


My compassion toward the people I encountered in India stemmed 
from the frequent use of this kind of vocabulary in_ my household: 
"your" people, "our" kind. Standing on this poorly paved road in Ser-
ampore, I had difficulty directly associating myself with the foreign 
scene I witnessed. I was experiencing a mild identity crisis, reaching a 
point where categories no longer applied. Being Indian seemed as irrel-
evant to what was important about my identity as being American or 
even Indian-American. These labels suspended and trapped me. 


Granted, Floral Park, a Long Island suburb, was not an environ-
ment which encouraged me to explore my Indian culture. I remember 
my youthful pangs of resentment toward my "differences" and imma-
ture jealousy toward my friends when Christmas and Easter came 
around. When I approached my mother about curfew for junior prom, 
butterflies fluttered in my stomach, "But evn-yone stays out until break-
fast, it's just a thing, Mom!" As my feelings of alienation were subtly but 
continually reinforced, I turned to the Indian "half' of my culture for 
solace. Every weekend, I escaped to a· temple on Kissena Boulevard in 
Flushing, New York. The familiar scent of agra batti and the quiet 
chanting of prayers provided a peaceful setting in which to train myself 
in classical Hindi music. I dressed in luxurious Indian clothing for wed-
