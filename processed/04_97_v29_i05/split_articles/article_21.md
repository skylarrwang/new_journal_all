dings and special holidays and attempted to learn Hindi in erratic 
spurts throughout junior high and high school. My Indian culture 
made me separate, special, important. When I couldn't be wholly 
American according to the skewed definicion I had formulated, I could 
always be Indian. 

But standing outside my grandmother's house in Serampore, I got 
my jeans soaked while trying to wash my hair, using only a manual 
water pump and buckets. Unable to master this seemingly simple task, 
I eventually sought out the local beauty salon. Along the way, I had to 
concentrate s-o hard on sidestepping manure and avoiding rabid ani-
mals that even walking proved to be a trial. I opted instead to ride in a 
rickshaw pedaled by a shoeless, toothless man. The hard skin on the 
soles of his feet entranced me until the vehicle came to a halt in front of 
"Glamourous Woman." Upon observing the perverse irony of this situ-
ation, I overpaid the rickshaw driver. I was simply attempting to relieve 
the guilt that weighed on my conscience, but I could not shake the feel-
ing of desperation I felt when I conceived of the unbridgeable distance 
between my world and his. 

T
hat is not to say that poverty defines a culture; rather, the rapes-
try of Indian culture is intricate and richly woven. Therein lay 
the crux of my dilemma. Despite my appreciation of the beauti-
ful sarees and songs and foods, the immediacy of daily life alienated me 
from what I possessively considered to be my country (my other coun-
try, at the very least). I feigned a comfortable stroll down the streets of 
Calcutta. but I even stuck out physically: I was taller than the average 
Indian woman and had a noticeably different physical carriage. When 
speaking Hindi, my American accent was glaring and elicited affection-
ate giggles from my family. In forgetting to aspirate a "ch" sound, I

These ostensible differences were only a small part of my alienation. !l 
More obvious was the strength and confidence with which my sister ~ 
and I moved and spoke, in contrast to the much milder, more submis- ~ 
sive behavior of my younger female cousin, Rinky. As my sister spoke ~ 
excitedly of her post-graduate plans, Rinky unobtrusively cleared the E 
kitchen table and prepared tea with downcast eyes. This image spoke ~ 
loudly to me. I turned over a single thought: I was an outsider in Floral ~ 
Park; I was an outsider in my native country. Did my identity float ~ 
within an abstract concept of being Indian-American, existing more at ~ 
the hyphen than within the words on either side?

Thoroughly jet lagged, I returned to Yale with this question weigh- ~ 
ing on my mind. I smiled weakly each time someone casually asked me -
about my break, and following my cue, recited a condensed version of 
my trip. As I recounted my experiences from the perspective of an Indi-
an, an American, an Indian-American, a woman, a student, I realized 
that I had cultivated a personal perspective not formed by belonging to 
any of these groups. My experiences have thus far formed who I am 
fundamentally, but these experiences live and breathe independent of 
labels. The voice and person of Samita transcended one-dimensional 
categories, and soared above the necessity to be pinned down. 

Gathering personal identity from contrived labels creates unneces-
sary apoplexy. Had I observed my native country without pigeonholing 
my perspective into that of an "insider" or an "outsider," my experience 
could have simply been about c:perimcing. The tears I shed for the des-
perate and proud five-year-old boy become more real when they are not 
shrouded by the self-pity borne of a false identity crisis.
