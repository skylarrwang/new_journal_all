**Rubber Soul**
**Author: Genny Taft**
**Page number(s): 6**

It 'is like an episode in a dream: six full-
bodied Emotions loll around inside a large 
plastic bubble, quivering at the advances of a 
violent Soul Surgeon. I hear the stifled words 
of the national anthem, indistinct and 
warped. But this is not a dream. The 
Emotions-Feara, Verita, Apathea, Sofro-
suno, Guiltea, and Free Association-are 
actors dad in rubber suits, singing under the 
direction of Hilary Koob-Sassen (DC '97). 
"Beautiful ... we're so ready!" he applauds and 
assures the voluntary captives. Only the over-
head lighting, which illuminates the peeling 
walls and creates shadows of the set and actors 
reminds me tha~ this is real, that I am in fact 
awake. 
Hilary, the acting coach and artistic direc-
tor for this unusual student film, began the 
screenplay during the summer afrer his fresh-
man year. Since then, the project has evolved 
into a full-length film, incorporating over 40 
students and alumni. Most of the ·set design 
and filming occurs at Hammond Hall, the 
sculpture building rooted between Grove 
Street cemetery and Science Hill.

~ Tonight the Emotions have taken over and 
}; they scurry around in their quarter-inch-
E thick, 
flesh-colored 
rubber 
~ suits. These suits give 
the actors maternal figures: large bosoms, 
stomachs, and rumps stuffed with poly-fil. 
The Soul Surgeon wears a metal collar and has 
accordion arms made of aluminum tubing. 
He shouts at the Emotions and warns that, 
like a gooey cheese croissant, Free Association 
will ooze all over them unless it is removed. 
So what is the film really about? When I 
ask various actors about the plot, the question 
is rebuffed by amused faces and quips of, "I 
think Hilary knows best ... " 
The plot is thick and involved, pivoting 
around a cryptic ideological message. Hilary 
lights up when I ask him if it is political: "Yes, 
we're breaking down some manifestos with 
this film!" He recommends multiple viewings. 
Part of the film's ideology is its collabora-
tive element. Hilary distributed the screenplay 
to participating actors, cameramen, musi-
cians, designers, and directors, and adapted it 
according to their feedback. The spirit of 
community encourages everyone to con-
tribute their ideas, critiques, manpower, and 
cigarettes. So when Hilary urges, "Let's rock 
the scene!" the saggy Emotions are invigorat-
ed. No one gripes about the time, disjunctive 
dialogue, or bizarre context. 
The movie is being filmed on a digital 
video can1era. This, along with the technical 
proficiency of the students filming, should 
make the film visually comprehensible and 
appealing. The film will debut on May 1 in 
Davenport College with another screening 
scheduled for May 2 in Davies Auditorium. 
The title is not yet fixed, but Hilary is think-
ing about deriving it from Waiting for Godot. 
"Like, Waiting for G/ob()-you know, globo, 
like the global economy."

**Dear Mr. President**

While most of my friends spent spring 
break sun-worshipping in Mexico, I had more 
pressing issues to attend to. The Clinton 
Administration tapped me to perform the 
sensitive work of a communications liaison 
between the White House and the American 
people. Of course the weather was a lot dreari-
er in Washington, DC, than in Mexico. But 
as it turned out, the northeastern climate 
didn't matter much since I couldn't really tell 
what the weather was like from my basement 
cubicle in the Office of Presidential Letters. 
And anyway, as I reminded myself on occa-
sion, I was there for the honor of serving my 
country, not to get a tan. 
Unfortunately, the privilege of working in 
the Office of Presidential Letters did not 
include the privilege of being paid, but I had 
known that when I applied. I was looking 
more for the experience than for the money. 
And besides, what better way is there to reme-
dy a case of mid-semester academic burnout 
than to work long hours in a high security 
environment? 
As it turned out, I found that few people 
outside the confines of the Yale campus are 
familiar with the idea of a working spring 
vacation. I could tell from the Presidential 
Letters staff's disbelieving looks that they had 
never raced out of their dorm rooms in order 
to beat a 5 p.m. Association of Yale Alumni 
externship application deadline. But that 
didn't prevent them from giving me work to 
do. 
Most of my time at the White House was 
spent in strategic paper flow management. I 
was entrusted with the task of conveying the 
President's letters to the typing office, or "sup-
port" as they are known to us insiders. And, 
when the letters were typed, it was up to me 
to make sure that they got back to the editors 
in their newly typed form. When I first got to 
the White House, I thought that would be the 
extent of my work. But no-my job had only 
just begun. When the editors had ensured 
that each letter was free of typos and mis-
prints, I brought the newly edited letters back 
to support to be typed on the President's per-
