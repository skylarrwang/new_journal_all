Mayday, 1970, for those who remember 
it all, is a confusing and somewhat em-
barrassing memory, its luster now tar-
nished by subsequent years of "eerie 
tranquility," 1950's nostalgia, and per-
haps a bit of plain Yale normalcy. But 
while the students were raising their 
Mayday fists and "shutting down Yale 
to open it up to the community," the 
University was thinking about shutting 
down part of the community-a~ least 
temporarily- to open it up for more of 
Yale. Yale was getting crowded, and to 
handle the admission of more women, 
the University either would have to 
cut back enrollment of its thousand 
male leaders or it would have to pro-
vide more student housing. 


The choice was clear. Although he 
would not make the announcement 
public until August, John Hay Whitney, 
'26, had decided to give Yale about 
$15 million in the form of a trust fund 
(to be paid upon his death), to build 
housing which would alleviate under-
graduate overcrowding. Early that 
summer, the Yale Corporation hired 
Mitchell/Giurgola Associates, a New 
York and Philadelphia architectural 
firm, to begin working on a housing 
program. At the same time, Kingman 
Brewster asked Elting E. Morison, then 
the master of Timothy Dwight College, 
to analyze undergraduate housing needs, 
and become the chief negotiator be- . 
tween the University and the architects. 


Two years later, Yale University 
called a full-fledged press conference 
to unveil the proposed plans for the 
thirteenth and fourteenth residential 
colleges-complete with architect's 
models and statements, a biography 
of Whitney, and Brewster's jokes about 
naming the new colleges George and 
Harry. The colleges' design featured 
an unusual flexibility in a site. where 
according to Romaldo Giurgola, the 
chief designer, "the University merges 
with the City" to provide "a crossroads 
for the campus and the community." 


The new colleges, situated on the block 
bounded by Whitney, Grove, and Tem-
ple, contained commercial space and 
parking to help ease relations with the 
City. 


ln the months following the Sep-
tember press conference, the initial 
glow around the proposed colleges 
began to wear thin. People began to 
criticize Yale's apparent disregard for 
the Kingsly-Havemeyer house, a New 
Haven landmark which seemed des-
tined to fall under the new colleges. 


It has become increasingly unclear 
just how much of a "crossroads" 
between Yale and the community 
the new colleges will be. And, in 
the words of one Yale administrator, 
negotiations between the City and 
the University regarding the proposed 
colleges have become confused "circles 
within circles, one of the most com-
plicated messes you could imagine." 


In October, 1970, Morison decided 
to call together a group of seven friends 
to informally assist him in his inquiries. 
ln addition to. his wife,. Elizabeth, the 
group included psychologist Kenneth 
Keniston, Trumbull master Kai Erikson, 
Professor Richard Goldsby, graduate 
student Nancy Vickers, architect Peter 
Millard, and Dean of Undergraduate 
Affairs John Wilkinson. He dubbed 
the group "Afterguard", a sailing term 
which refers to a group of wise old 
sailors who sit in the cockpit and ad-
vise the skipper, who is free to accept 
or ignore their suggestions. 


Especially in the days when the 
issue of University governance was 
under review, the group's popular title, 
the Morison Committee, may have 
implied to some that the group was a 
formally established structure within 
the University's decision-making 
framework. The Committee members 
themselves, however, were not con-
fused about Afterguard's role. Erikson 
recently empliasized that, "the Com-
mittee has to be seen as an advisory 
board to Morison. That's what its real 
status was." 


Morison and his committee sought 
to determine, through meetings and 
conversations with students, whether 
Yale needed and wanted more residen-
tial colleges, or whether it would better 
be served by alternative housing pro-
grams. Certain objective indicators, 
such as the increasing number .of stu-
dents moving off-campus, showed that 
at least ten percent of the students 
preferred not to live in the residen-
tial colleges. The Student-Community 
Housing Corporation (SCHC) strongly 
urged that alternative housing be con-
structed to meet this student demand. 


In the spring of 1971, Erikson and 
Millard offered a Trumbull College 
seminar in "The Architect and the 
University." The seminar was not 
designed specifically as a student ad-
junct to the Morison Committee, but 
six of the fifteen students saw them-
selves in this capacity, and consequent-
ly devoted their efforts to producing 
proposals for the Committee. Erikson 
and Millard were pleased with such 
student input, but only on the same 
advisory basis on which Morison 
accepted their proposals. 


Unfortunately, some of the students 
believed their suggestions were not 
given serious consideration and that 
a legitimate student perspective had 
been overlooked. ~though Morison 
apparently was open to all proposals 
and discussions, he insists, " 1 never 
got an interesting or useful idea out 
of all this other than that we want 
colleges." 


While that may have been an unduly 
harsh evaluation, it is true that the 
Committee had to make feasible, 
long-range proposals, and could not 
embrace opinions or values that might 
soort change. And, in the years follow-
ing Mayday,opinions and values did 
indeed change. John Wilkinson recalls 
that in the frrst few months of the
