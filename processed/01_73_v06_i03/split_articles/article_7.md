how too strange, too formal, too loud to 
pass for permanent members of the Yale 
community. In my mind, I fancied them 
to be the interlopers. 

What torture to be an alumnus! ln two 
days of conferences in the Law School 
Auditorium and Harkness Hall, the Uni-
versity tried its hardest to make us feel 
welcome. But each time Kingman 
Brewster told us how important we were, 
I felt more and more like an outsider. 

After an arm's-length welcome to the 250 
representatives in the A Y A gathering that 
week- arm's-length because some of the 
alumni cherished their independence-
Brewster assured us that the University 
was to be ultimately "accountable" to 
the 80,000 alumni we represented. 

" Accountabiltiy" was "not just a slick 
word," he said. On the other hand, did 
the alumni want the students to be 
polled each time the University was to 
make a decision? Of course not. Then 
we could see, Brewster's speech implied, 
why it was important not to poll the 
alumni each time, either. So if we could 
just hold off on our demands, then Brew-
ster would find it easier to deal with the 
crazy demands of the students, who of 
course, we all know, are selfish and 
irrational. 

When I was a callow student, demand-
ing immediate curriculum and grade re-
form, not to mention coeducation, the 
great grey mass of alumni was always 
held up by our allies on the faculty as the 
biggest impediment to action. It all 
seemed so logical. There the alumni were, 
like the Republican Party preventing 
President Kennedy from moving to recog-
nize Red China. They were what told 
us to go slow. Now, at Yale, the alumni were 
being told the same thing about the stu-
dents. And who to refute it? The Uni-
versity, the alumni know, is in a constant 
state of turmoil these days. I don't be-
lieve all those reports of "eerie tranquility." 

Brewster was introduced at the first meet-
ing by someone who portrayed him as the 
beleaguered, embattled chief executive, 
residing in a tinderbox, surrounded by a 
volatile mix of students and faculty. 

I must hastily add that this was my 
own view, prejudiced perhaps by years of 
watching Brewster's attempt to furnish 
something for everyone in all the de-
cisions he had to make. To be fair to 
Brewster, moreover, nowhere did he do 
this as explicitly as Michael Galligan-
junior faculty member, .. architect" of 
Yale's university council system and self-
appointed gadfly to the alumni- who did 
it inadvertently. Galligan lectured us two 
or three times, l recall, each time with a 
condescension that most people found 
both annoying and amusing. Galligan 
pouted at one point that if the alumni 
failed to endorse and increase in the num-
ber of women at Yale, students would 
become further alienated from their 
elders, and possibly even destructive. 

Compared to Brewster, Galligan was the 
infant who threatened to hold his breath 
and turn blue- Old Blue-if he didn't get 
his way. 

Brewster, by contrast, is one of aca-
demia's most gifted administrators. 

And in a larger sense, he is doing more 
than just a sellingjob. He is trying to 
encompass different constituencies that, 
while they have a lot in common, have a 
lot in conflict as well. The constant 
letters we get from Class Secretaries, Class 
Agents, Class Treasurers, and Yale offi-
cials, are testimony to the University's 
need for us, maligned (and self-maligned) 
though we are. 

Yale's first goal, of course, is to con-
vince us that any differences the Univer-
sity and its alumni have are mere out-
growths of the "failure to communicate." 
In his discussion of admissions policy, for 
example, Sam Chauncey told the A Y A 
that the chief shortcoming in the past had 
been one of "lousy public relations," 
which, Chauncey must know himself, is 
not really a shortcoming at all. 

Nonetheless, the very creation of the 
A Y A rests on the goal of greater commu-
nications. And communications, in turn, 
hinge on the importance Yale alumni 
attach to being alumni. 

From my own experience, the alumni's 
attachment varies widely, but not for 
those who go to gatherings like the A Y A 
meeting in New Haven. In our discus-
sions of admissions policies, we all dwelt 
at length on the importance of Yale's role 
in producing America's leaders. Every 
change in admissions policies was argued 
in this context. Yale ought to admit 
more women, more blacks, more chi-
canos, etc., precisely because these 
groups ought to have their share of Yale 
alumni to lead them, too. In all the de-
bates, there was little mention of educa-
tion for its own sake, and it occurred to 
me that perhaps it was this fact that most 
of all separates the alumni from the stu-
dents in New Haven. 

The alumni at the A Y A were those 
"leaders of men" types that are easy to 
make fun of. But if they view things at 
Yale from a different perspective, so be 
it. It was Clark Kerr, president of 
Berkeley during the Free Speech Movt.-
ment, Brewster reminded us, who said 
that the University can take care of 
everything by offering this simple pre-
scription: sex for the students, football 
for the alumni, and parking for the faculty. 
The virtue of that remark is that it brings 
students and faculty in on the joke, and 
that is just as well. Maybe one day the 
New Yorker will catch up with them, too.
