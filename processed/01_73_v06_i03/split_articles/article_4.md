Committee's deliberations, many stu-
dents expressed an interest in alter-
native housing, a break with tradition, 
and the achievement of a closer rela-
tionship with the community. However, as months passed and Mayday 
consciousness faded, the Committee 
found that more students articulated 
their appreciation of such traditional 
amenities as wood panelling and fire-
places for their rooms within the resi-
dential colle~e setting. 

The february, 1971, SCHC "Housing" 
report confirmed some of Wilkinson's 
observations. Most c;tudents, the re-
port said, were satisfied with the qual-
ity of life in the colleges. But, the 
report continues, .. The single most 
pressing problem with the colleges, 
most students feel, is the excessive 
crowding which has set in since Yale 
became co-educational." 

Numerous students favored off-
campus life, the report continued, 
because "many of them feel that their 
education cannot be total or authen-
tic unless a substantial portion of their 
time is spent outside the University." 

Two years later, such social rationales 
are rarely advanced. 

Granting that students overwhel-
mingly favor the residential college 
system, the University, and Morison 
in particular, came to question whether 
it was the University's obligation to 
provide alternative housing for that 
significant minority of students dis-
satisfied with college life. Although 
Morison believes that "the college 
system properly developed is the most 
useful instrument of undergraduate 
education," he also feels that students 
should not live in colleges for the whole 
of their Yale career. But, he believes 
that if Yale provided alternative hous-
ing, much of the benefit of such hous-
ing would be lost. Wilkinson agrees, 
claiming that the off-campus movement 
is partly spurred by an anti-institu-
tional sentiment. 

A pinwheel-shaped structure nine 
stories high, the new colleges will re-
semble neither the traditional court-
yard plan of James Gamble Rogers' 
original Harkness Memorial Quadran-
gle, nor the irregular forms and en-
closed courtyard plan of Eero 
Saarinen's Morse and Stiles. In a 
formal way, they literally open out 
into the community, thus avoiding the 
unfriendly "keep-out" feeling gen-
erated by some of the older struc-
tures on campus. 

Trying to make the colleges com-
patible with their urban neighbors, 
the architects searched for a brick 
facing that would match the four 
different shapes and colors of brick 
near the structure: three different 
red colors from St. Elmo's, Timothy 
Dwight, and Silliman Colleges, and a 
white stone on the church across 
Temple Street. As a result, the brick 
facing will be a completely different 
color and much larger in size-6" by 
8" compared to 2" by 6". An off-
white plexiglass module for the stu-
dents' desks and window will punc-
tuate this brick-like wall, attempting 
to match the white of the church across 
the street. 

The two courtyards will be small, 
about 120 feet long and I 00 feet wide, 
and sunken about eight feet below 
street level. They are bounded by the 
nine-story high rise with its flat facade 
on one side and the busy street on the 
other. A four-foot high wall will 
separate the sunken courtyards from 

The courtyards are not important 
circulation passages in or out of the 
new colleges, nor do they function as 
an actual juncture of the city and the 
University. But, because they are not 
cloistered retreats, neither will they 
provide the gentleness and peace that 
are characteristics of the older 
courtyards. 

The entryway system. an ineffi-
cient and expensive mode of con-
struction, has been abaodqned. 
instead, eight single rooms are linked 
to a living room on an alternate level. 
The provision of glass enclosures in 
the hallways offsets the normal drab-
ness of hallways in student dorm~. 

Even though the University decided 
to build two new residential colleges, 
their philosophical justifications 
differed from those offered in 1930 
when the first eight colleges were 
constructed with a gift from Edward 
Steven Harkness, Yale 1897. Today, 
few speak openly of the virtues of an 
academic enclave. Architect Romaldo 
Giurgola regards the site of the new 
colleges more as "a vital area where 
the University merges with the City, 
a crossroads for the campus and com-
munity, a place of encounter." In 
fact, Mitchell/Giurgola was appar-
ently chosen by the University pre-
cisely because Giurgola displays in 
his work an acute consciousness of 
the relation of the school to the 
urban community. 

Yet, according to Erikson, the ini-
tial conception of the University-
community interface was that of a 
frontier, not a crossroads. And, indeed, 
despite the public pronouncements, 
philosophical underpinnings, and 
architectural concessions, the new 
re•idential colloges will very likely 
remain as isolated from the New Haven 
community as the existing colleges. 

The University's position is more 
ambivalent than hypocritical. It wants 
to open itself up as much as possible 
without undercutting its main func-
tion- to serve and protect its students. 

The locked gateways in all the 
colleges are hardly invitations to the 
community, but they are considered 
necessary responses to the upsurge of 
crime on campus in recent years. 

Similarly, the iron mesh on the first-
floor windows in Morse and Stiles is 
an accoutrement depressingly familiar 
to urban residents. The new colleges 
will be equally subject to the hazards 
of urban life, and surely, their gates 
too will be locked. The necessities of 
security create an unfortunate, instan-
taneous barrier to an open University-
community relationship. 

The commercial space on the ground 
floor of these colleges, designed in 
order to maintain New Haven's tax 
base, has come to represent most 
clearly the potential crossroads between 
Yale and the community. But the 
realization of that vision is by no means 
certain. Is Morton's Pharmacy a cross-
roads? Is the Yale Co-op a crossroads? 
It seems that even when students and 
New Haven residents shop in the same 
stores, interaction is minimal. 

Public walkways transversing the 
college site are also integral elements 
of the "crossroads ideology." But 
architect Fred Foote of Mitchell/ 
Giurgola, the project director, expresses 
concern that these walkways will be 
vastly under-used particularly by · 
community residents. The glass-en-
closed promenades and the glass wall 
in each living room visually link the 
new colleges' residents with the rest 
of Yale and New Haven. However, 
more likely than not, New Haven will 
become no more to these students 
than just another pretty view. 

Timothy Dwight College, for years 
surrounded by New Haven on three 
sides, never became a place for en-
counter between the University and 
the community. The tWo new col-
leges, despite certain structural inno-
vations, will apparently be no more a 
place for encounter than TD has been. 

The only way in which the new 
colleges- and indeed, Tirriothy Dwight 
and the other eleven residential 
colleges-can become a crossroads is 
through programmatic innovations 
by the University. If Yale encourages 
more New Haven residents to partake 
of University offerings and facilities, 
then perhaps the University as a whole 
will become more of a crossroads. 

Certain problems result from a 
single internal contradiction. A Yale 
residential college cannot be a place 
of encounter. But residential colleges 
which allow non-students to use 
freely their study, dining, ·or recrea-
tional facilities would risk depriving 
their own students of these benefits. 

Given the University"s limited resources 
and the ·constraints of urban America, 
the residential college system is to a 
great degree an academic enclave. 

Especially' if we want to change these 
relationships, we should not delude 
ourselves that the creation of two 
new residential colleges on Yale's 
outskirts'will bring Yale and New 
Haven significantly closer, in any more 
than tile-most obvious physical way. 

This separation between Yale and 
New Haven has been txemplified in 
the planning process. As a result, 
construction faces near-certain delay. 
Building was seheduled to start in 
March of this year, and the colleges 
were to be ready for occupancy in 
September, 1975. The Yale Daily 
News, reporting the unveiling of the 
new college designs, observed, "Al-
though official presentations to the 
zoning committees, City Pian Com-
mission, and Board of Aldermen do 
not begin until November, informal 
approvals were apparent yesterday." 

However, that yesterday was a 
long time ago. A high city official 
recently pointed out that the city and 
the University should have worked 
together more closely from the start, 
and charged that Yale deliberately 
excluded the city from early stages 
of the planning. Resulting inade-
quacies in the design have prevented 
the City Plan Commission from 
approving the program. Until the 
Commission makes its recommenda-
tions, the Board of Aldermen cannot 
act. Ultimate approval must come 
from Mayor Bart Guida. If Yale then 
puts the project out to public bid, 
construction may not begin for ano-
ther two months after that. It is 
impossible to pinpoint a starting date, 
but even if no further hitches develop, 
the original March starting date appears 
unlikely. 


**New Yale College Construction**
**Page number(s): 5-6**

In a December 18 Memorandum 
to the City Plan Commission of New 
Haven, Yale agreed to four modifica-
tions of its plans. It will move the 
Kingsley-Havemeyer House to 33 
Whitney Avenue at its own expense. 
To conform to legal requirements, 
it will increase by eight the number 
of on-site, underground parking spaces. 
It will modify the design to improve 
the deficient off-street loading facili-
ties. Finally, although Yale observes 
"this is against our better judgement," 
the University is willing to increase 
the commercial space by adding 3000 
square feet of commercial facility on 
Temple Street. In a letter to the 
University advising against the in-
creased commercial space, New York 
real estate consultants James D. 
Landauer Associates, Inc., echoed 
the concerns of numerous observers: 
"lf you recall, we have never been 
very bullish on the commercial pros-
pects for the Grove Whitney College. 
We have indicated to you that any 
commercial development undertaken 
for this location will have to be most 
imaginatively marketed to achieve 
even a modest degree of success." 

(ln a later development, a Yale Cor-
poration committee headed by Cyrus 
Vance, indicated to the City that Yale 
was also willing to pay taxes on the 
land occupied by the new colleges, 
as well as the Yale golf course). 

This new construction is expected 
to bolster the regeneration of this 
area, where empty shops attest to an 
absence of vitality. But the actual 
commercial possibilities are still up 
in the air. Who will rent these spaces 
at rates more than double current 
prices? Elting Morison hopes for 
at least "a damn fine restaurant," 
and both the city and the University 
hope for a damn high occupancy rate. 

Some members of the city govern-
ment limit their expectations of the 
project to such dollars-and-cents 
calculations, and eschew romantic 
visions of a crossroads fostered by 
nine stories of Yale University atop 
several thousand square feet of New 
Haven commercial space. The City 
Pian Commission still has the matter 
under consideration, but in a state-
ment of personal opinion rather than 
official policy, City Plan Director 
John McGurty observed, "I do not 
feel that such a crossroads can 
be achieved." 

Although New Haven's voice may 
not have been heard throughout the 
planning for the new colleges, the 
other participants in the process were 
more vocal and involved. The archi-
tects seemed genuinely eager to 
~!'\counter student opinion, though 
the sampling technique may be ques-
tioned. One wonders, for example, 
how many off-campus students were 
contacted. 

Yet Fred Foote lived in TD for a 
month, observed Yale, and spoke 
informally to students whenever 
possible. He now credits students for 
proposing the fundamental concepts 
that guided Mitchell/Giurgola's archi-
tectural creation. The emphasis on 
student privacy- 95 percent of the 
rooms are singles- and on the indi-
vidual's relationship to groups of 
other sizes- four to eight students 
will share a common, 20 foot by 20 
foot living room- is a product of 
student desires. The value of inter-
action between two colleges, as Foote 
observed between Morse and Stiles, 
was a concept incorporated into the 
plans for the new colleges. 

The essential flexibility of the 
plans is due to a recognition of chang-
ing times and changing student needs. 
As the Morison Committee realized, 
their decisions would have to remain 
feasible for the long run. Mitchell/ 
Giurgola similarly realized that its 
plans, to withstand unforeseen future 
change, had to be adaptable. The 
various living units in the colleges 
bear the same kind of relation to space 
that modular units bear to time: 
they may be re-arranged in a great 
number of ways in order to fit par-
ticular circumstances. Moreover, with 
sustained evidence of such a student 
preference, kitchens may be installed 
quite easily, thus converting a college 
suite into a nearly self-sufficient 
apartment unit. 

Except for the objection that these 
are residential colleges rather than 
an alternative housing scheme, there 
is likely to ~e little fundamental stu-
dent dissatisfaction with the structure 
of the housing. Some students may 
be dismayed to discover that the new 
colleges lack squash courts. In 1962, 
when Morse. and Stiles were built 
without squash courts, their proxi-
mity to the gym vanquished most 
objections. The new colleges, on the 
other hand, are the entire width of 
Yale College away from the gym. 

But the architects concluded, and 
the University concurred, that squash 
courts are an indulgence; and due to 
spatial and budgetary constraints 
they could not be constructed. lt is 
small consolation that the new colleges 
will have a basketball court. 

The other noticeable victims of 
these constraints are the masters' 
houses. They are much smaller and 
less elaborate than the masters' houses 
in the other colleges, a change which 
itself may be beneficial. Morison felt 
that the expensive residences- the homes 
in Morse and Stiles cost $300,000 
each- generate demands on masters 
that keep them from being ordinary 
men, let alone scholars. Kai Erikson 
also approves. In fact, both his first 
floor living room and dining room, 
now open to his college public, are 
not used for strictly family functions. 

The constraints, however, pale 
before the generosity of the $15 
million gift. And John Hay Whitney, 
the key participant in this process, 
was more than merely a silent and 
beneficent donor. Fred Foote says, 
"I can't remember another project 
we've done where we've seen as much 
of the donor." The architects still 
find it hard to forget the sight of 
Whitney's Rolls-Royce pulling up to 
the curb on West 97th Street in Man-
hattan, on the day that Whitney came 
to visit Mitchell/Giurgola. However, 
although Whitney was constantly kept 
up-to-date and personally reviewed 
the evolving plans, he did not inter-
fere in the planning process. Morison 
observes that Whitney "never per-
sonally expressed a preference." 

John Hay Whitney desires an alle-
viation of the overcrowding in the 
residential colleges. But, several sig-
nificant questions remain unanswered, 
and they are questions that will not 
be answered by the physical con-
struction of the new colleges. 

Who will live in these new colleges? 
The answer encompasses broad and 
interrelated issues: student 
housing preferences, and the New 
Haven housing market. These two 
new colleges should be opened, at 
least on an experimental basis, to a 
more equal graduate student-under-
graduate mix (with a greater sprink-
ling of faculty members). Elting 
Morison believes that the proper de-
velopment of the residential college 
system demands such a mix. He was 
impressed by the workability of 
mixing all classes, including freshman, 
in Timothy Dwight College. His extra-
polations convince him that the 
greater diversity achieved via the 
graduate student mix would be 
equally beneficial. 

Yale graduate students have ex-
pressed a strong desire to break their 
isolation, and live together with the 
Yale College population. A poll of 
over 1,000 graduate students con-
ducted by the Graduate Student 
Senate during the spring of 1972 
reveals an interesting set of results: 
50 percent (including married couples) 
indicated they would appreciate the 
opportunity to live in "undergraduate" 
housing; 26 percent listed their first 
preference for housing as a mixture 
of graduate, professional and under-
graduate students; 35 percent expressed 
a strong preference that the new living 
units include members of the New 
Haven community outside of Yale. 

What remains to bar the way to the 
creation of University rather than 
undergraduate colleges? What pre-
vents us from experimenting with 
inducements to include Yale employ-
ees-or even other New Haven residents? 

Another plan for University housing-
one which has conspicuously lacked the 
fanfare of the Mitchell/Giurgola pro-
ject-may become the second part of 
a mixed-use University housing policy. 
Since June, 197 1, a committee headed 
by Alfred Fitt, special assistant to 
President Brewster, has been studying 
the possibilities for more graduate-
professional housing around the Yale 
campus. The commit tee is investi-
gating the possibility of persuading 
commercial developers to build high-
quality, low-rent apartments on 
University land bounded by Chapel 
Street, Howe Street, Park Street, and 
Edgewood Avenue. The apartments, 
which could include another 300 
units, would not be operated by the

The architects' floor plans. The Lower 
Level and First floor (below) show the 
"common" places in the colleges. Where 
would you put a squash court? To the 
lower right of these plans and that of the 
Second floor (opposite, top) is the area 
given over to commercial space. Not 
quite another Harvard Square. 

In order to make sense out of the 4th
Fourth and Seventh Floors and the 
Third, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Floors 
(opposite, bottom), try stacking them 
in your mind like an architectural Dag-
wood sandwich. Add some provolone 
staircases, and you have an idea of 
how the duplexes (actually triplexes) 
will work. Although taste is always a per-
sonal matter, we don't recommend 
eating your finished product. Why not 
make a real sandwich in one of the new 
kitchens? The plans allow for the storage 
areas adjoining the common or living 
rooms to be turned into kitchens at 
minimum cost. (Ninth floor plans not 
shown here.)
