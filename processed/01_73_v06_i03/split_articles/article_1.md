Last Thursday the Yale College Fac-
ulty passed the second of two resolutions 
aimed at implementing a tri-mester pro-
gram. Convinced of the financial neces-
sity for change of some sort, and suspect-
ing that the plan would become a reality 
regardless of their deliberation, the 
faculty took upon itself the responsi-
bility for promoting crucial educational 
change. Of course, as pointed out in fac-
ulty discussions, this is only a pilot pro-
gram. The faculty may withdraw the step 
they made last week. But the manner of 
deliberation and hasty acceptance offers 
little hope that the reconsideration next 
fall will be thoughtful enough for rever-
sal. The trimester plan was adopted with-
out debate on either of two alternatives 
proposed in the report of the faculty's 
own Blum-Pelikan Committee: a calen-
dar consisting of four quarters, or the 
"strengthened semester" plan proposed 
originally by the Dahl Study Group. The 
plan was endorsed and the mechanism 
for its final implementation developed 
without detailed discussion of the plan--
partially because at this point no details 
are known. And yet the faculty acted 
with all deliberate speed. Resolutions de-
signed to stall implementation were de-
feated handily, as were proposals for fac-
ulty study of an alternative summer pro-
gram which would not so directly affect 
the fall and spring terms. 


Why was the faculty moved to accept 
this version of calendar reform so read-
ily? Beyond their awareness of the econ-
omic exigencies, the answers begin to 
thin out. One can assume they weren't 
overly concerned with the sophomoric 
demand for a more satisfying December 
vacation. Perhaps they were more heavily 
struck by the favorable terms of the pro-
posal as it would affect them-teaching 
one summer in six or seven years in return 
for an extra fall or spring term off the 
following year, and an extra month off 
every other year. Perhaps so struck, they 
were less interested in the educational im-
pltcations and uncertainties of the plan 
than we-without the benefit of such ex-
tensive personal inducement--can afford 
to be. Here are some of the implications 
of the trimester calendar which I've heard 
discussed in the Last few days: 
• the change in fall and spring teacher-
student ratio resulting from compensa-
tory faculty leaves for summer teaching 
• the effect particularly on small de-
partments and majors in those depart-
ments of only 1/6 or l /7 faculty presence 
during the summer 
• the effect on graduate student disserta-
tion progress (;ind thus job availability) 
caused by summer T A responsibilities 
• the possible downward trend in 
Graduate School financial support caused 
by increased student earning potential 
• the week or two likely to be cut off 
each of the three terms 
• the effect on personal and class ties of 
the undergraduate taking his residence in 
a sequence independent from that of any 
group 
• the effect on spring sports 
• a summertime break-down of the res-
idential college system and the reversion 
to traditional dormitories 
• the hidden inducement for the under-
graduate to accept the three-year BA 
• the hidden impetus for the faculty to 
move to the 32 credit graduation require-
ment 
and finally for the original calendar reform 
enthusiasts, 
• the educational effect of fulftlling re-
quirements for five courses in a mad rush 
before Christmas--or, conversely, the 
likelihood of taking home exams and pa-
pers over vacation, in which case nothing 
much would have changed 

We can only hope that these and other 
implications will be carefully considered 
before a tentative decision by the faculty 
puts Yale education crashing ahead on 
automatic pilot.
