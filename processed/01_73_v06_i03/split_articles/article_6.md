Money 
doe$n't

on 
Tree$ 
by Susan J. Friedman 
Along about third grade, perhaps because 
then I- started getting an allowance, or 
perhaps simply because some section of 
my babybrain became eager for that par-
ticular form of mastery, it became incum-
bent upon me to determine the financial 
situation of the world. Money, I per-
ceived, was beauty, and beauty money. 
My allowance, 25 preinflation cents a 
week, taught me not only did I not need 
anything, but I hardly even wanted any-
thing, except candy. So every Saturday 
morning Linda and I took Bus No. 21 
downtown, where we proceeded to gorge 
our fat little cheeks with Milky Ways 
from Grant's and chocolate doughnuts 
from the Cottage Bakery, and little else, 
though we spent a lot of time looking at 
things like paperback books and lipstick 
and spent hours trying on rings for under 
$1.00 while the saleswoman glowered 
because we never bought anything: they 
were too cheap. We knew, already, that 
Grant's was tacky. 

There were certain entire economic 
spheres in which it never occurred to me 
to spend my money, spheres exclusively 
inhabited by the grownups: clothing, 
food, shelter, medical care, i.e .. anything 
over $2.50. Those things, like coats and 
shoes and chemistry sets and perfume-
making kits and watercolors, I just asked 
for. Or else they appeared spontane-
ously: "I'll pick you up after school and 
we'll go get shoes," my mother would 
say; or she would leave five dresses on my 
bed and I would select what I wanted. 
Or I would ask for a wood burning kit and 
it would appear. Certainly I am not com-
plaining about this; I had everything my 
babybrain could think of, plus the 
essentials. However, it left me in the 
situation of having a purely discretionary 
income, and very little discretion, and 
even less to buy. Not understanding that 
money might be spent on articles in the 
real world, I began to save up the quarters 
and later the half-dollars in a shoebox 
which I'd cut a slit in, subliminally con-
scious that I would spend this on some-
thing unknown to me but which would 
bring me happiness, and if I waited long 
enough, I would figure out what to buy. 
So I waited, and after a while, especially 
since I got birthday money and Ch_ilnukah 
gelt from my grandparents, when one of 
my parents would see into the box, they 
would say, "You have more money than 
God." I probably did. I was indepen-
dently wealthy at the age of eight. 

All these hints about God's money, 
added to my ~elief that money was 
spent on unknown things which brought 
great joy, made it abundantly clear that 
money was ethereal, if not actually re-
ligious. After all, hadn't I heard the 
story of worshipping the golden calf and 
completely missed the point and thought 
that was the most beautiful object in the 
Bible? Didn't God have money? I knew 
then that money was beauty. 

"Do you think that money grows on 
trees?" my parents would ask when I 
flew in on the wings of a new request: 
crayons, a campus jacket, a cinch belt. 
Yes, my dear mama and papa, I do 
(though I was polite enough not to con-
tradict them openly). That's exactly 
where it grows, and I know because of 
the Twelve Dancing Princesses who 
slipped through a secret trap door in 
their bedroom every night and went out 
to dance with twelve handsome princes, 
on their secret, enchanted journey pass-
ing through forests where, first, all the 
trees were of crystal, then, all of gold, 
then there were emerald leaves tinkling, 
and silver, and ruby, and I thought I 
would die from the beauty of it all, the 
illumined jeweled trees and the lovely 
princesses in their full velvet gowns. 

The horrible part of the story comes 
at the end when the princesses are found 
out and prevented from going back. 
Their father, the king, noticing their worn-
out slippers each morning, had offered 
the hand (and that's not all) of any 
princess to any man who could pene-
trate the mystery. And of course, after the 
routine beheadings of the few who 
failed, a fair prince did come along who 
wrecked the whole thing by spying on 
them from behind his invisible cloak (my 
first inkling that men were tricky). It 
ends with a wedding which they said was 
splendid, but of course didn't compare 
with the beauty, and the freedom, of 
the underground kingdom, from which 
the daughters had been snatched, twelve 
Persephones ripped from the rich earth. 

It was a miserable ending, the women 
were routed, but the first half was my 
first hint at the pleasures of a matriarchy, 
in which, logically, money did grow on 
trees. Logically, because in the real world 
patriarchy, i.e .. where the men had ftrst 
dibs on everything and went out all day 
to make adultmoney, money did not 
grow on trees. In fact, in the real world, 
I couldn't even spend my money. 

Despite the risk of capture by a spying 
prince, and in defiance of all those 
emperors, obviously without clothes, who 
said that money did not grow on trees, 
when I knew it did and if only they 
wouldn't be so literal and mundane 
they'd know it too, and out of some 
urge to restore the pnncesses, and my-
self, to the lost joys of the matriarchy, 
I became a Queen. 

Every Saturday aftetnoon, haviug 
wiped the chocolate off our faces and 
reboarded the No. 21 Bus, Linda, my 
dearest friend in all the real world, and I 
came back to my house and sat around 
saying, ''What do you wanna do?" 
.. 1 don't know. What do you wanna do?" 
"I don't know. You say." "No, you 
say." Then we'd usually go upstairs into 
the closet and get out my mother's huge 
box of silk scarves. We stripped down to 
our underwear and draped ourselves with 
the scarves, four for each of us: one on 
top, one on the bottom, one for a head-
dress, and one as a shawl. Then we put 
on as much of my mother's jewelry as we 
could support, and other assorted ban-
gles, belts, gloves, high heels. Down-
stairs in the closet was a dark, carved 
cane which we took turns carrying as a 
scepter. The other one had to use a 
yardstick. Both Queens, we led one 
another on tours of our respective 
palaces. One week Linda would get the 
dining room and I the living room, we 
divided it up somehow, and then I would 
start leading her from corner to corner, 
as I had seen my mother do after we 
moved into the new house, saying in my 
best Queen voice (which was actually a 
Hermione Gingold voice), "Your Highness, 
look at this solid gold ashtray which cost 
$5000. And over here, you will see the 
emerald cat which cost a million dollars." 
"Well, in my palace we have one which 
cost two million dollars.Â·' 
"Yah, but my palace has solid diamond 
windows." 
"Well, mine has solid gold floors, 
Your Highness." 
"Your Highness, look at my solid 
silver lamp with ruby decorations which 
cost seven million dollars." 
"Well, I have a crystal chandelier with 
diamond lightbulbs which cost fifteen 
million hundred thousand dollars, 
Your Lowness." 

The game never lasted very long, since 
we bedazzled each other to the point of 
mordant jealousy. Sometimes we got so 
angry that Linda would threaten to go 
home, and we would run outside on the 
(emerald) lawn screaming, "Go home, 
Your Lowness" and "Shutup, Your 
Stupidness," racing around in our scarves 
and undershirts and headdresses. That 
was always the end, the crumbling of the 
kingdoms in anger and envy: but at 
least we could do it every week, and 
neither one of us got snatched and mar-
ried off to any sneaky prince. Nor did 
any emperor convince me that money 
did not grow on trees, did not transmog-
rify into beauty incarnate: solid gold 
ashtrays and emerald leaves. ln my 
kingdom, it did. 

That's what was so queer about the 
Yerows who lived up the street and were 
the richest people I knew. They prac-
tically lived in a mansion, and they owned 
racehorses and an Alaskan husky named 
Boris, though no swimming pool. Once I 
asked my mother how rich the Yerows 
were and she said, "WeU, their pockets 
are deeper than ours." But there were 
too many dark wrong things always hap-
pening up there, and I was profoundly 
confused because money was beauty and 
joy. Mrs. Yerow was never home, and 
when she was she was always yelling at 
Carl not to put so much salt on his food

or he'd die young; and Mr. Yerow was 
never home either, never; and the maid 
was surly; and once on my way home 
Boris got out of his cage and bit the arm 
off my snowsuit; and one night when I 
was supposed to sleep over there with 
Barbara I got so homesick that my 
parents carried me home in a blanket, and 
I never went back to sleep or even stayed 
very long. Sometimes it was fun, like 
when Barbara and 1 played Giant Step in 
the living room, or when we had the 
Sunday Club at her grandfather's and ate 
breakfast there every week, but even that 
turned bad when he was mean to me 
once and said that Carl should get some-
thing that I wanted because Carl was a 
boy and his grandson. So I didn't go back. 

I think the Yerows were the second 
half of the story, where the princesses 
are defeated and everyone, except the 
king and prince, loses. The Yerows were 
a patriarchy full of mean dogs and mean 
grandfathers and absent fathers who had 
affairs with women and odd brothers who 
took too much of salt and things I wanted, 
and even a surly Cinderella maid who 
always made Carl's sandwich first for 
lunch. Someone had expelled the Yerow~ 
from the beautiful kingdom, and I had 
some idea who it was, but I was too 
polite to say anything. 

As my shoebox treasury of grace grew 
in magical power, and as I became more 
certain that someday I would indeed 
think of something to buy with it, I also 
became more firmly convinced that this 
thing would be the likes of an emerald 
leaf: pure beauty, pure good. 

Other people, especially my grand-
parents, dealt badly, far too grossly with 
money. For "saying a piece," we would 
get a pair of mittens or a measly nickel. 
"Saying a piece" consisted of reciting a 
poem, singing a song, or telling a joke in 
front of the assembled grownups. And 
as the instant trios of cousins finished a 
spinechilling rendition of "Rock of Ages" 
or as one wheeled heavily off the end of 
an arabesque, they gave us the mittens 
and a kiss while the adults, the aunts and 
uncles, applauded and laughed and said, 
"she looks like a dog at a hydrant." If 
your piece was especially good, though 
no one knew what her criteria for good 
actuaJiy were, Nana would cup her hands 
over her mouth and show you, and you 
alone, her false teeth. She'd unthwack 
them from her gums and eject them with 
her tongue, then, finding us suitable terri-
fied, she clicked them back in and up, 
thwack! That was the single most pecu-
liar gift I ever received, and 1 thought it 
awesome, stupendously unbeautiful. As 
earthly as a mouth. And once, at our 
house, my grandfather told me that if I 
didn't talk at all during supper he would 
give me a silver dollar. I didn't, and he 
did. But thinking about it afterwards, I 
thought he was one very cruel king, who, 
taking pleasure from his cruelty, rein-
forced my own beliefs about men, who 
were fools about beautymoney if good 
with adultmoney, and about women, who 
inhabited the crystal forests of beauty-
money. Until they were caught. 

When I was younger, around five, I had 
still thought that men knew about beauty-
money. My father had brought me a 
solid chocolate apple, and that was surely 
pure goodness. In fact, it was my mother 
who forbade me to eat it all at once and 
kept me to one section a day. Thought I: 
the father giveth and the mother taketh 
away. But as my wisdom in these matters 
increased, I realized that I had been mis-
taken: it is the men who taketh away and 
are dumb. Though I should say that I had 
serious doubts about my mother, and 
hence, of all women, except me and Linda 
and other princesses I knew existed, be-
cause although my mother never, for 
example, stopped us from playing Queen, 
and never said anything which indicated 
she didn't believe in the kingdom of 
beautymoney, she also disappointed me 
by saying such things as, ''Why don't you 
think of something to spend your money 
on and get it?" When it was clear that I 
hadn't found the article yet, and could 
not be content to spend the shoebox on 
something so sublunary as a game or 
a toy. 

Yet the things which I did finally spend 
the money on were things my mother 
understood, which was reassuring. She 
certainly understood, even if she most 
ta.rtly disapproved, 
the black and red 
lace bikini underpants I brought home 
one Saturday on the No. 21 Bus. Unda 
got a pair too. And she understood, and 
encouraged, when I decided to buy a 
misty landscape by a Japanese artist. 
She even paid to have it framed. I can 
look at it from the typewriter and ima.-
gine Japanese princesses walking through 
it, though they're not actually painted in. 
But then, they wouldn't be, since the 
artist was a man. And my mother even 
understood, despite some feeling of 
jealousy at first, when 1. decided to quit 
teaching in the most Stygian of high 
schools and use money to support the 
writing of stories about money growing 
on trees and dancing princesses. For now 
writing is the beautymoney, the puregood; 
the stories all come from the same magi-
cal kingdom out of my sometimes shaky 
matriarchy. Shaky because sometimes I 
get very afraid that I am being indulged-
1 am, for now at least, living on money 
earned by my father, for even if it has 
been entrusted to me, I still profoundly 
question whether I can create puregood 
and beautymoney out of, and living on, 
adultmoney which adamantly scoffs at 
growing on trees. 

I think it is a moral question. If men 
refuse the kingdom of silver trees, how 
can I justify using men's adultmoney to 
help me reenter that kingdom? Is that 
not dishonest? 

But then I think of what that king did 
to those princesses, and realize that it is a 
war and a matter of consequence; that it 
is the war my grandfather was winning 
when he paid me to stop talking or the 
war Carl Yerow won when his grand-
father favored him over me. So I think: 
if this is a real war, then I have every 
right to fight in it and every right to take 
the money and run to erect whatever 
kingdom I believe in, and it doesn't make 
any difference if they keep telling me 
that I should get married already and 
settle down, or that I should use makeup 
and wear a bra, or that money does not 
grow on trees. It's either them or me, 
their place or mine. And it's going to be 
my place, where the money transformed 
itself into trees twenty years ago and it's 
just a matter of telling enough people 
about it now so that they'll support me 
when I say we belong down there in the 
earth with the jeweled landscape and the 
princes who are handsome, but who can't 
keep us from going home when we want 
to, and can't make us get married or put 
us in bondage or convince us that money 
doesn't grow on trees. 

The men used trickery to punish the 
princesses. The princesses used stealth to 
enter the magical kingdom. If it's a moral 
question, then the princesses win. â¢
