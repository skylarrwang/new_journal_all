EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Parchman Penitentiary stands in the 
heart of the Delta. Until recently farming-
was done with mules driven by white 
and black convicts. Inmates are segre-
gated and one of the largest black camps 
is near the community of Lambert. 

During the summer of 1968 I visited 
the Lambert camp and recorded and 
ftlmed black inmates chopping wood to 
the rhythm of work chants, a tradition 
which originated in West Mrica. From 
five to fifteen men cut wood together 
lifting their axes in unison and chopping 
on the beat of a work chant called by a 
leader who faced them. Verses of the 
chant spoke of escape from Parchman by 
swimming the Sunflower River to con-
fuse the trailing bloodhounds, of hoes 
returned to the "Captain" and refusal to 
work, and of a beautiful woman named 
"Rosie" who was waiting outside the 
camp for her man. 

In Parchman, as in other parts of the 
Delta, nicknames are the only names by 
which a person is known. These nick-
names usually reflect either personality 
or physical characteristics. The follow-
ing conversation is with a former Parch-
man inmate called "Have Mercy" who 
received his nickname when he pro-
tested the beating another prisoner 
received. 

Have Mercy described an incident 
which involved a prison trustee nick-
named "Old Timer" or "Timer" because 
he was in his nineties. His account 
describes what convicts call the "innee 
world" of Parchman Penitentiary: a 
world of fear in which only the strong 
and intelligent survive. Like the trick-
ster rabbit, the black man had to move 
and think faster than his white boss. 
Because he was a "high roller" and hoed 
weeds from [chopped] cotton as fast as 
most men could walk, Have Mercy 
gained favor with prison guards and 
escaped the beatings which others 

WJren you wn-e up then on the farm, 
wlult would they /unle you doinK out 
there? 
Chopping cotton. Picking cotton. 
Pulling stalks. Ditching. Cutting down 
trees in the woods. Ufting up and 
toting logs. All that kind of stuff. We 
would have a log about that high [eisht 
feet]. Be as long as from here to the 
door there. Have six mens with hand 
sticks. Just like me and James here. 
He'd tote right hand and I'd tote left. 
And then the man is up there walking, 
up on the log. He weighed two-hundred 
and fifty now. He'd say "Better n~t drop 
this log and hurt me. Better not drop 
me." 

WJren would they get you up in the 
morning? 
Three-o'clock. Eat breakfast at the 
long table, and at three-thirty we'd be 
setting on the end [of the field) waiting 
till it got light enough to see and work. 
Cold, ooo wee! That's what be the 
matter with my foots. My hands, some-
times they just aches all across there, 
you know, from cold. I couldn't 
straighten my hand out no straighter 
than that. 

Now we pulled up the cotton stalks 
ahead of the folks that was breaking up 
ground. Every man pulled up cotton 
stalks and piled them in his own middle 
from end to end. And the half-trustees 
come along behind us and burn them up 
out of the plow hand's way. They would 
be breaking up ground. Four mules and 
a great big old plow. They called it a 
"road plow", a "sand buster" with four 
mules to it. Just git right up in the top 
of that row and split that middle of 
that row, you know. Four mules pulling. 

When would you come home from 
work in the evening? 
When it was night. Summer, winter, 
and fall and spring. 

How long were you up there, Have 
Mercy? 
Seven years. 

Why did they send you up there? 
Well, just following bad company. 
Ain't did nothing. A gang of us was 
gambling in old juke houses, you know. 
Ain't nobody staying in them. Just old 
houses where we'd meet to gamble. 
Every Saturday night, why we'd meet 
there and git to shooting dice. I ain't 
did nothing. 

The gang (was with, they shot about 
three or four games, and I was with them. 
If you followed a gang of people, it makes 
no difference about whether you did 
something or: no. If they do something 
and you with them, why you in the 
blame too. Right? Somebody got 
killed and th.ree got wounded. I couldn't 
git outta there. I was in it, but I hadn't 
did nar' shoL 

Did the women up at Parchman work 
ill the fields too? 
No sir. The women, they hoed the 
vegetable fann and made them stripes 
what we wore. You see when them 
stripes come in there, they shipped them 
in rolls of cloth. And them hard row 路 
women made six suits a day, and them 
"legs .. made three. You know what a 
.,eg" is? He way behind. He can't work 
much. When we be chopping cotton, the 
leg be way behind. All them hindest 
folks. why we called them legs. They the 
same way about picking cotton, pulling 
stalks. chopping cotton, or doing any-
thing. 

Them "high rollers" that git up 
through the iaeld, weU I was one of them. 
Yeah, Boy. I c~ld chop cotton as fast 
as I could trot along the road. I didn't 
care about the grass. I hit that grass and 
(was] gone. Leave that stand [of cotton] 
and not stop walking. 

And they had a lots of them up there 
was supposed to have been higher roUers 
than me. But when they got in that 
grass, by the time they git as far from 
the end as from here to the store, I was 
at the other end. They said "Now what 
kind of lick is that nigger got? Ooo wee, 
he gone. Great goodness alive." 

I'd be trying to stay out the way of 
that man. I said "White Folks, when you 
git to throwing that leather, my foots 
git as light under the bottom as a piece 
of paper. I wonder when is my time? .. 
He say "I ain't gonner bother you. 
You's a high roller." 


I be knowing that, but I still clown, 
you know. If I see his shoes unlaced, I 
run there and jump on my knees and 
lace'em up. If I see them nasty on the 
toe, I git my old rag out of my pocket 
and wipe them off for him. All that's to 
make it. You got to do all that. Act the 
fool. You got to act the fool. You in 
the penitentiary. You got to act the fool 
to make it easy on you. They'll look at 
you and say "Now you know he want to 
make it. He's a good worker and then he 
clow.ns too. We ain't gonner bother him". 

And it was another thing I could do. 
They had about three or four handmade 
guitars. I could play one of them And 
I'd git somebody else to play it and I'd 
dance by it. I can dance, you know. 
I can do the buck dance. If you pl~ the 
music, I'll know it when you play it. 
I'd rather buck dance than eat a ball of 
onions. 

Mrat is your real name? 
My real 
name js Johnny Lee Thomas. 
My home is Arcola, Mississippi. 

Why do they call you Have Mercy? 
In the penitentiary, in Parchman, they 
was beating a man to death one day, and 
this very man had been chopping cotton. 
He told them "Just spare life. Here's the 
grass and here's the cotton. You can beat 
me to death, but that's all I can do. I 
can't do no more." 

And the sun was beating down, and I 
say .. Looka here. Don't you hear the 
man say 'Spare life' and he doing all he 
" 
can? There's more work days than one. 
Have mercy on that man and let him up 
from there. Don't hit him another lick." 

路 And they started to calling me that 
over there in the penitentiary. "Have 
Mercy." I went there in twenty-nine. 
I left in thirty-seven. I got the name 
there and it followed me on out here. 
"Have Mercy.'' 

What else happened in the 
penitentiluy? 
They beat you half to death, but they 
give you plenty to eat. They give you 
a'plenty, but it was half-cooked. They 
fed us good when folks come on the 
Fourth of July, and Thanksgiving, and 
Ouistrnas. And after that they fed us 
like a gang of dogs. That's right. I was up 
there a gang of years. 

And at that time anybody whipped 
you. It was two drivers at every camp, 
and a sergeant and a night watchman. 
But they tell me now that don't nobody 
whip but the sergeant, and you have to 
do a mighty bad crime for him to whip 
you. 

But at that time they'd hit you just 
as long as they felt like raising up their 
路arm. Course me, I never did git marked 
up, or scarred up cause I could chop 
cotton as fast as you could walk along 
the road. If you caught the cage, you 
lcnow what I mean, the cage you stay in 
in the camp during the day if you didn't 
work. If you take what they gived you, 
why you was welcome to stay in there. 
Course me, myself, I never was sick. lf 
you took a quart of castor oil and a pint 
of Epsom salts you could stay in there. 
Now who wanted all that? You didn't 
need all of it. I'm glad I never was sick. 
I never was a trustee, and I never was 
half-trustee. They kept me straight up a 
line (in the field] . 

Mrat would they do when they 
beat you? 
They wouldn't do nothing, but had 
some kind of grease there they'd grease 
them up with and go to work the next 
路day like they ain't hit you nar' a lick. 

How would they betzt you? 
Well they pull your breetches down. 
And that strap was that wide, that tltick, 
and that long with the handle. And that 
leather is loaded. The leather, you see is 
loaded. They have something in there 
that cut your flesh up. It mark you up. 
They didn't have to hit you all that hard 
with it. It't a certain way they hit you. 
They have a man on your head, and they 
have you flat on your stomach and a man 
on each arm, and a man on each leg. You 
can't do nothing but lay there. He gonner 
hit you seventy-five or eighty licks. And 
some of them, when they let them up, the 
clothes would stick to their flesh. I 
knowed a many a man had to wear 
padding 'tween his clothes to set down. 
All back there was just raw. In other 
words it was like that when I was there. 
But I wasn't marked up cause I could 
get on out the way. But there's a whole 
lot of them that's out here today that's 
marked up. But you gonner work right 
on. I don't care if you is marked. 

And them guards. At that time here 
is the way they guarded you. It was like 
that, with their hand on the trigger. Just 
like over here is "my catch." Over here 
is yours, and over there is yours. If a man 
jump and come this way, I supposed to 
stop him. But if you see l can't git him, 
why ain't no harm for you to take a 
couple of cracks at him. 

But that guard- 1 don't know. I never 
was a trustee-but that guard worked as 
hard as me, because he's all the time 
looking. His eyes is in a strain all day. 
He don't know who gonner try to git 
away. Them scoundrels will try you to 
see can you shoot. It was a old man up 
there. He was ninety-eight years old, a 
old timer. He'd been there since nineteen 
hundred. I wadn't even in the world in 
nineteen hundred. I had done picked 
him out and said '1ltat old man can't 
shoot. rm shore gonner run over him." 
l thought that, but I wanted somebody 
else to try it. If they'd git away, then 
it'd be my time. Well, a good friend of 
mine, I loved that boy, his wife said "Well, 
John Thomas, l done all I could for you. 
I didn't know you had 'natural life."' 

See "natural life" is longer than a 
lifetime [sentence) . A lifetime is just a 
hundred years. But natural life mean 
that if you stay two or three hundred 
years, you still ain't served your time. 
And the governor, he don't give no pardon 
for natural life. Well he had that kind of 
time. and she didn't know it. She was 
waiting to try and git him a pardon. 
She thought he had lifetime. So after she 
found that he had natural life, she wrote
