Walking home from a downtown bar at 
two in the morning, I met a black man in 
his early twenties who wore a black knit 
cap and an army jacket. He had a few 
grey hairs in his beard. He asked me for 
a cigarette and some directions. I gave 
him one, lit it, and asked him where he 
wanted to go. "I want to go to the 
place where my brother died ... just to 
see it." 


He had read about it in the news-
papers. It happened at the corner of 
Olapel and Orange. It had been a long 
time since he decided that he couldn't 
stand downtown New Haven. But he 
wanted me to take him there. 


We cut across the Green. I wasn't 
saying anything. 


"Man, I can't understand why he 
didn't tell me what was bothering him. 
He was at my house an hour before it 
happened. I loved him. We rapped 
_, , ~ 
about everything." 


I rested my arm on his shoulders and 
told him that he was really bumm10g me 
out. He said I shouldn't touch him. 


We got to Chapel and Orange and he 
told me that his brother had jumped off 
of the top of the corner bank building. 
"In the newspapers they said that it 
was five stories high. Do you think it's 
five stories high?" 


"Sure." 


"There's no way you can say it ain't 
five stories high-Right?" 


"Yeah." 


five stories high." 


"Nope." 


He explained that his brother was no 
man, but a cat, and had climbed up the 
front of the building using the strength 
of the tips of his fingers and toes, with 
help from some bricks that were sticking 
out. 


He sat down on the sidewalk and told 
me to sit down with him. I said I wanted 
to stand. He raised his voice to tell me 
that he could still smell his brother's 
blood on the sidewalk. He went over to 
the nearby sewer grate and said he could 
smell the blood in the sewer. He muttered 
something about how it was appropriate 
that his brother's blood should be down 
the sewer. The police drove around the 
corner and gave us a second look. I 
thought that if we were both picked up I 
would probably be released without any 
trouble. He broke my train of thought: 
"Why didn't he just get some members 
of his tribe together, go into the bank 
with machine guns, kill all the mother-
fuckers, and take all the money he wanted? 
He didn't have to jump from a flagpole 
on top of a bank." 


He was ready to go. He wanted a 
hamburger 1f all the "pig establishments" 
weren't closed. I said that we could get 
doughnuts and coffee. 


"I am a meat eater. I'm a man, right?" 


We walked passed the Green, up Chapel 
Street, and stopped in front of the con-
struction site at the Yale Art Gallery. I 
was in the middle of pointing to the 
White Tower, and telling him to go there 
for a hamburger. He broke in and said 
that all he and his tribe needed were the 
two caterpillars and some machine guns 
and the bank would be ·'Knocked off 
just like that." I agreed. When we got to 
York and Chapel, I told him I was 
splitting. 


"Hey, I'm gonna give you this medal 
I got in the marines and I want you to 
give it to my brother." 


'"I can't man. I don't know your 
brother. You give it to him." 


"OK." 


I told him I was splitting. 


·'Take this medal and put it on my 
brother's grave out in Branford." 


"But I don't know your brother, man. 
You should do it." 




He started toward the White Tower. 


I went home.

The Yale alumnus is one of our classic 
conuc archetypes. He is a staple of New 
Yorker cartoons. for instance, and inside

The month I graduated in 1968, the 
New Yorker ran a drawing on its cover of 
a middle-aged man, a blue-and -white 
striped jacket buttoned neatly around 
his paunch, standing alone in the middle 
of what was obviously the Old Campus, 
looking rather mournfully at his bygone 
surroundings. "Ho, ho, ho," the cover 
seemed to be saying, " Ho, ho, ho." 


Certainly the New Haven crowd jars 
much mirth from the alumnus, too. When 
I was a freshman in Vanderbilt Hall, an 
alumnus knocked tentatively on our door 
one Indian summer afternoon. He wanted 
to show his old room to his young son, 
who is probably at Yale or applying 
there today. We all thought it was pretty 
funny, like the fulminating letters in the 
Yale Alumni Magazine, always calling for 
the removal of Bill Coffin or Staughton 
Lynd or a radical sociologist named 
Robert Cook, who used to speed to 
classes on a motorcycle and always seemed 
to be running for Congress. 


Last November, when I visited New 
Haven for the first gathering of the Asso-
ciation of Yale Alumni (A YA), I carried 
with me enough detachment to continue 
to be amused at the alumni, even though 
I was right there with them, my Magic 
Marker name on my lapel encased in a 
plastic tag. As I walked awkwardly 
around the campus, people seemed to 
stare at me as if I were some kind of 
interloper, until I realized it was my name 
tag that was attracting their attention. 
Name tags are demeaning, anyway. Once 
I took off the tag, I could pass as just a 
Law student, I discovered to my relief. 


Of course the older alumni were all some-
