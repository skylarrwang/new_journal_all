You can't beat this 
Sony路Miracord路Advent 
-system. $499. 
If you're interested in exceptional clarity 
and faithfulness of reproduction at moderate but 
satisfying volumes, our $499 SONY-MI RACORD-
ADVENT system is for you. 
When the Advent speaker first 
appeared on the market a few years ago it 
revolutionized the industry by out-performing ma-
ny speakers twice the price. It has since become a 
classic and remains one of the most colorless, 
linear, and well-balanced speakers at any price. It 
utilizes a 12-inch felted cone woofer and a unique 
dome and rolled ring molded tweeter in an acoustic 
suspension designed to reproduce the entire music-
al spectrum, from the lowest notes you can hear all 
the way up to 20,000 hz. 

The Sony 6045 receiver has enough 
clean, crisp power to easily drive the Advents to 
satisfying levels in a medium-sized room, while 
keeping IM and harmonic distortion well below 
5%. The tuner section is highly sensitive and 
selective and will pull in even weak and distant 
stations with suprising clarity. The Elac-Miracord 
625 changer has the famous pushbutton operation 
that makes it the easiest-to-operate of automatic 
turntables. It uses a four-pole asynchronous motor 
to maintain constant speed despite variations in 
line voltage. Rumble is inaudible and wow and 
flutter are down to .07 and .03%. We have chosen 
the ADC-250XE cartridge, whose low mass and flat 
response allows you to get all the music out of 
your records and keep distortion down to a 
minimum.
