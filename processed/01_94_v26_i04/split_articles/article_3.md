Dink Stover, freshman, chose his seat in the after-
noon express that would soon be rushing him to 
New Haven and his first glimpse ofYale University. 
He leisurely divested himself of his trim overcoat, 
folding it in exact creases and laying it gingerly across 
the back of his seat; stowed his ttaveling bag; 
smoothed his hair with a masked movement of his 
gloved hand; pulled down a buckskin vest, opening 
the lower button; removed his gloves and folded 
them in his breast pocket, while with the same ges-
ture a careful forefinger, unperceived, assured itself 
that his lilac silk necktie was in snug contact with the 
high collar whose points, painfully but in perfect 
style, attacked his chin .... Each movement was exe-
cuted without haste or embarrassment, but leisurely, 
with the deliberate savoir-faire of the complete man 
of the world he had become at the age of eighteen.

here is no way to know or prove what Americans 
think of Yale. Perhaps those of us with a stake in 
Yale's public image are guilty of conceit; most of the 
country and indeed the world does not care about Yale. Yale 
probably matters less to more people than most of us would 
care to imagine. ("Yale, huh? That's nice.") 

Often, however, the mention ofYale does matter-it 
elicits wide eyes, an intake of breath, a hushed "oh," or a 
taken-aback, "oh," or a you-must-think-you're-really-some-
thing "oh." Yalies have all seen these reactions, and joke 
about how to avoid telling people where they go to school. 
("Just a lit de college in Connecticut," and, when pressed, 
they offer their residential college name.) They hang their 
heads a bit and wonder, what is this person think-
ing? What do they think ofYale that makes them 
breathe "oh!" like that? Where do they get these 
ideas? 

Just as it is impossible to prove what 
Americans think of Yale, there's no way to prove 
why they think it. It seems fair, however, in assessing 
perceptions of Yale, to consider the representa-
tions of Yale in widely-read literature-con-
structed notions ofYale that people encounter. 

Arguably, literature-fiction and sometimes 
non-fiction-in attempting to create character falls back and 
perpetuates certain ideas of Yale. Yale graduates in public life, 
mosily men, must answer to and sometimes excuse their asso-
ciation with Yale. The Yale Men of literarure have so strongly 
influenced the identity of the Yalie as a wealthy, white male 
that Bill Clinton (LAW '73) was accused of a privileged back-
ground despite the realities of his humble beginnings. The 
mystique established by Yale Men in literature lives on in the 
public imagination, despite its dissociation from reality. 

The figure of the Yale Man dominates the image of the 
university in literature. There are, of course, no women. 
The refined Dink Stover and his better-known descendants, 
F. Scott Fitzgerald's Nick Carraway of Th~ Great Gatsby and 
Tom Wolfe's (GRD '57) Sherman McCoy of Th~ Bonfire of 
th~ Wlnitin-these elegant, arrogant men overshadow Yale 
itself. Their authors describe their confidence, their chins 
and their neckties-their Yaleness-without describing 
Yale. Readers are more likely to remember that Nick 
Carraway went to Yale than that Yale is in Connecticut. 
(Many guess Boston.) Nick was "at New Haven," but 
nobody remembers that; they just remember Yale, and 
Nick, and the Long Island mansions, and the formalwear in 
the movie of Th~ Great Gatsby. Yale in these novels is an 
intangible, almost invisible entity, uncharted, that exists 
merely to churn out these specimens ofYaleness. Hence, the 
mystique of the untouchable, the indescribable. 

The Yale that Dink Stover discovers best exemplifies 
that mystique. This hero of Owen Johnson's 1911 novel 
Stowr at ~le, gets off the train and steps onto a Yale campus 
that today's students, professors, and alumni would not rec-
ognize. Wearing suits and ties throughout, the men of Yale 
"wheel" various activities in order to make their names 
known so that they have a chance of being tapped for sec~ 
societies. If the students attend any classes or do any study-
