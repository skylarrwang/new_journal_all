future has in store, my hopes and 
expectations are great," he said. 

Lombardi echoes D'Adamo's 
enthusiasm but recounts one rather 
disturbing experience. One night the 
cacophonous sounds of partygoers 
reached unbearable levels. Car alarms 
seared through the otherwise custom-
ary orchestra of noises. At their wits' 
end, the Lombardis called the police. 
The police Hstened attentively but did 
not take any action, for no shooting 
had occurred. 

Perhaps this experience symbolizes 
what is no more than a generation gap 
between the Term Timers and present 
Yalies in New Haven. It is exactly this 
generation gap which Gibbons relish-
es. Attending these classes not only 
provides a chance to keep his mind 
active, but also offers the opportunity 
to become more connected with "Yale 
today." 

Reconnecting alumni with the 
university was what the AYA had 
intended when it established the Term 
Time program. "It allowed alumni to 
come as a matter of right," said 
Eustace Theodore (PC '63), executive 
director of the AYA. 

Judy Cole, senior assistant direc-
tor of the AYA, admitted that the 
Association's emphasis on keeping 
alumni engaged and committed is not 
without its monetary aims. No institu-
tion can afford to ignore alumni pri-
marily because they provide both 
funds and input, without which a uni-
versity cannot operate. Theodore fur-
ther notes, however, that Term Time 
enhances perceptions of Yale. "Not 
many alumni say that Yale only wants 
money anymore." 

Although the large majority of 
former Yalies do not participate in 
Term Time, the thought that they can 
reassures them that Yale is still striving 
to fulfill the original purpose of the 
university. By demonstrating the via-
bility of Yale's commitment to further-
ing education, the AYA hopes that 
alumni will more eagerly involve 
themselves in the institution, either 
through financial or personal means.

While D'Adamo works in the print 
shop, Gibbons has directed his energy 
towards chairing his class' reunion 
functions. 

Since Term Time is relatively new 
and still in a state of evolution, it is not

B 
ut if Term Time is in fact a tech-
nique by which to secure finan-
cial commitment and input 
from alums by re-introducing them to 
their alma mater, then is Yale's 
approach really an honest one? While 
the AYA seeks to provide a rewarding 
experience for its alums, does the per-
ception generated paint a truly com-
plete picture of the contemporary 
Yale? Certain things alums experienced 
did indeed disturb them, such as the 
loud, late-night parties, the deteriorat-
ing residential college system, and stu-
dent behavior. Although by" their own 
accounts, their experiences were 
undoubtedly positive ones, the ques-
tion remains whether or not they still 
fit into a campus now dominated by 
the youth of the 90s. Closing the gen-
eration gap, although not high on the 
list of AYA objectives, might simply be 
impossible. 

Despite these questions, Term 
Time at least recognizes the existence 
of these issues and seeks to address 
them. For years Yale has offered its 
alumni opportunities by which they 
can in effect "reenter" the academic 
aspect of Yale. Since 1977, the AYA 
has also sponsored a two-day event 
every June, during which time the 
alumni are not only wined and dined, 
but are also exposed to some of the 
most highly acclaimed professors at 
Yale. Term Time, though, provides a 
much more sustained and comprehen-
sive opportunity to engage in the 
ongoing process of learning. "Term 
Time," notes D'Adamo, "engenders in 
me warmer feelings about the universi-
ty, much more so than if Yale were 
[only] to throw cocktail parties." 

Gibbons adds that Term Time 
provides an attractive aspect to Yale 
because it discards the "superficial 
view" of the alumni experience. 

Although he does not discount the 
monetary tenets underlying such pro-
grams as the June Seminar, which he 
referred to as a showcase of sorts, he 
relishes the way which Yale provides 
alumni with an atmosphere reminis-
cent of the times they spent together at 
Yale. Theodore also mentions that 
when alums are again put in contact 
with the great minds ofYale, they have 
the chance to relive the experience 
they had when they were here for the 
first time. 

Yet the number of alums who 
participate in Term Time remains 
comparatively small. Obvious reasons, 
such as basic demographic restrictions, 
account in part for this disparity. In 
addition, few alums have the time to 
engage in such a long-term commit-
ment. Lombardi, though, maintained, 
"The only reason that more people 
haven't done Term Time is that they 
don't know about it." 

According to D ' Adamo, Term 
Time is Yale's best kept secret. More 
people, he believes, should participate 
for one very basic reason: "When you 
stop learning, you stop living."
