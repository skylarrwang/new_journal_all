those dyspeptic.Yalie bond traders (but 
then again, 1987 was a bad year for 
them altogether). 

W
at did the story do, then? 
Clearly, no applicant who 
would meet minimum Yale 
standards of tolerance rejected an offer 
of admission because of it. On the 
other hand, it seems possible that a 
number of qualified gay and lesbian 
applicants have felt more comfortable 
accepting Yale's offers in the years since 
because of the story: how could 
Harvard or Princeton compete with a 
whopping (if inaccurate) 25 percent? 
In pragmatic terms, a few of those 
indignant alumni pulled their contri-
butions, but the endowment didn't 
collapse and Yale weathered the storm. 
Unfortunately for me, though, my 
grandparents read the Wall Street 
Journal, too. I've never heard them 
mention "one in four," but I know 
they have pretty good sense of what 
goes on at Yale. They love the fact that 
I share an apartment with a French-
German male and an African-
American Jewish woman; it would 
not, however, be o.k. if they knew that 
Christoph is gay and Sara comes from 
a long line of communists. 
The point is, they know that Yale 
is extremely liberal and fear that I get 
more so with every day I spend here. 
Over Christmas break of my sopho-
more year, my grandfather called a 
family meeting-in my absence-to 
discuss just how far left I had strayed. 
(Over the dinner table the previous 
night I had suggested that fellow Yale 
man Bush should be indicted; some-
one tried to change subjects, and I 
ended up defending Madonna's sex 
book.) When my mother told me 
what had happened, I was mortified. 
They seemed ready to disown me for 
my politics: it convinced me that my 
sexuality was even more unacceptable 
and I rededicated myself to denying it. 
Luckily, a crisis was averted; they 
calmed down and we now try to avoid 
politics altogether. 
My parents' response to my com-
ing out has been textbook-perfect. 
They love their Yale boy uncondition-
ally: sexuality, politics, and all. Ifl were 
to flunk out tomorrow, they still 
would. But my grandparents-who are 
by now rather impatiently waiting for 
me to find Ms. Right-liked the pre-
Yale me better. For them, it's not qui-;:e 
a fair exchange: a great education, a lib-
eral worldview. When they find out 
I'm gay, though, all bets are off. 
I hate to tell my conservative 
friends (someone has to do it) but the 
fact is that "liberal" is the one word I 
most often hear when people ask me

about Yale. Perhaps it's just a semantic 
problem (liberal arts vs. Liberal 
Democrat), or a demographic quirk of 
Oklahoma, but I doubt it. The fact is, 
quite simply, that people at home per-
ceive Yale to be a hotbed of just about 
everything: political correctness is 
assumed to dominate every aspect of 
life, and my old friends have visions of 
radical feminists and tree-hugging 
environmentalists running amok. I just 
smile and pull out my pictures: the vast 
oceans of J. Crew assuage their fears. 
I try to keep a sense of humor 
about the whole thing. Since I spent so 
many years saying "liberal" when I 
really meant "gay," a lot of things 
throw me off balance. When I visited 
my high school over Christmas, my 
old principal smiled broadly and 
asked, "So Jay, did you go off to Yale 
and turn into some big liberal?" I took 
a deep breath, looked him in the eye, 
lm intent on making 
up for the time 
I wasted trying to be 
a traditional Yalie; 
now, lm just trying 
to be myself 
and said, "No, Mr. Mathers. I was 
born that way." There was a moment 
of tension and then, inexplicably, we 
both laughed. 
Little encounters like that make 
me realize how being a Yale will make 
my life easier. People in the real world, 
like Mr. Mathers and even my grand-
parents-who otherwise wouldn't tol-
erate me as liberal or gay-may cut me 
a little slack. There are no sure talis-
mans against hate and prejudice, but 
I'm hoping that a little of that old Yale 
magic still goes a long way.
