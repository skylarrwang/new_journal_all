Stov~r would also be blissfully ignorant of a Yale student's 
academic responsibilities. A reader would perceive instead 
that at Yale, a man labors to secure his "crowd" and status, 
and ultimately his election to an elite society. 
Stover's ascent begins that first afternoon on the train, 
his grooming and mannerisms designed to impress and even 
intimidate. That evening, Le Baron, a sophomore, informs 
him, "You're going to be judged by your friends, and it 
just as easy to know the right crowd as the 
wrong." 
Stover asks what Le Baron means 
by "the right crowd," ~nd Le Baron 
explains that it is '"the crowd that 
is doing things, working for Yale; 
the crowd-' 
'That the class ahead picks 
out to lead us,' said Stover 
abruptly," interrupting Le 
Baron. 

The brutality of the fight 
Le Baron describes shocks 
Stover, as it would embarrass 
the contemporary Yalie. The 
struggle for status Le Baron 
depicts represents a Yale 
that few students today 
even want to recognize. 
What does "working for 
Yale" mean? To Le Baron 
and his crowd, working for 
Yale is a kind of holy cru-
sade. Yale to them is the 
Yale of the blue banners we hang in our rooms. The Yale we 
so casually droop over our fireplaces stood much nearer to 
God to the Yalies of 1911. Every football game, every crew 
race, was to them a prayer of the faithful. 

While Johnson injects from the start a note of irony in 
his frank dissection ofYale's elite competition and the arro-
gant young men, he only explicitly critiques the system 
when Stover begins to rebel against it. Stover works hard for 
Yale all through his freshman year, laboring unsuccessfully 
but valiantly on the football and then the crew team, mak-
ing friends with all the right people while learning the 
names of all the rest. He is duly tapped for an all-important 
sophomore society and is considered a leader of his class. 
But in spite of his hard-won success, Stover begins to cxpe-
rience doubts about a system that labels the majority of peo-
ple the "wrong crowd." He begins to sympathize with a 
group of students agitating for an end to the sophomore 
society system. Ultimately, he tears off his society pin, 
stomps on it, and declares himself opposed to the system. 
He loses several society friends, but gains new ones, truer 
ones, among the "wrong" element of the college, those who 
do not "work for Yale" as Stover does. 

While Johnson suggests a critique of Yale 
elitism with his depiction of Stover's stance 
against the sophomore societies, in the 
end Stover is tapped for Skull and 
Bones, clearly the highest achieve-
ment for a Yale Man of the day. 
In the moment of his election to 
the elite, Stover's eyes "blun:ed 
with tears, and he knew how 
much he cared, after the long 
JJtonths of rebellion, to be no 
longer an outsider, but back 
among his own with the stamp 
of approval on his record." 
Stover is a Yale Man to 
the end, and Johnson does not 
chide him for it. Dink plays 
fair, and rebels according to 
his sense of fairness. He is 
no radical; even his rebellion 
is in the name of the most 
sacred of all American val-
ues: democracy. The Yale 
elite recognizes the conser-
vative nature of Dink's revolt and embraces him with their 
tap. His friends are proud of Yale and its Men for taking 
him back; to them it evinces Yale's holiness in a new way. 
Brockhui:st, the bookish fellow who works for the literary 
magazine but refuses to "heel" it, and disavows any interest 
in the society system, voices his pride in Yale: "Well, Yale's 
good enough as it is. It takes an awful lot to stir it, but it's 
the most sensitive of the American colleges, and it will 
respond. It wants to do the right thing." 

But at the end of his speech, Brockhurst seems to 
change his mind: 'Tm not satisfied with Yale as a magnifi-
cent factory on democratic business lines; I dream of some-
thing else, something visionary, a great institution not of 
boys, clean, lovable, and honest, but of men of brains, of 
courage, ofleadership, a great center of 
thought, to stir the country and bring 
it back to the understanding of what 
man creates with his imagination, and 
dares with his will. It's visionary-it 
will come." 

But if Johnson hints at a different, 
more democratic, less otherworldly 
Yale, it has been a long time coming, 
at least in literature. The Yalie 
Sherman McCoy represents in Tom 
Wolfe's 1987 New York Times best-
seller, The Bonfire of the Vanities, is an 
almost conscious descendant of Dink 
Stover. But where Johnson suggests his 
crltlque only indirectly, Wolfe 
unleashes a furious attack. He satirizes 
the unfortunate Sherman into a carica-
. ture of Stover. Sherman is the Yale 
Man swollen wii:h the idea of himself, 
larger than life and ridiculous.· 
Sherman McCoy, 38, presumably the 
Class of '71 of '72, earns $980,000 a 
year, lives in a $2.6 million, 14-room 
Park Avenue co-op apartment. He 
inhabits "the Best section of the capital 
of the Western World in the late twen-
tieth century-" and sells bonds on 
Wall Street. He sends his 
daughter (Campbell, a 
family name) to 
"the Best School 
with the Best 
Girls 
from 
the 
Families." 

Mockingly, Wolfe describes McCoy's 
self-image, his joy in his "terrific pos-
ture ... terrific to the point of imperi-
ous," his pleasure in his "full head of 
sandy-brown hair ... a long nose, a 
prominent chin ... He was proud of his 
chin. It was a manly chin, a big round 
chin such as Yale men used to have in 
those drawings by Gibson and 
Leyendecker, an aristocratic chin, if 
you want to know what Sherman 
thought. He was a Yale man himself." 

Sherman's Yale chin elevates him 
above the rules that govern ordinary 
mortals. The arrogance with which he 
bears his Yale chin plays a large part in 
his story. "As they crossed Park 
Avenue, he had a mental image of 
what an ideal pair they made; 
Campbell, the perfect angel in a pri-
vate school uniform; himself, with his 
noble head, his Yale chin, his big 
frame, and his $1,800 British suit, the 
angel's father, a man of parts; he visu-
alized the admiring stares, the envious 
stares, of the drivers, the pedestrians, 
of one and all." 

He thinks 
of himself 
as a Master 
of 
Universe, as 
in his daugh-
ter's plastic dolls.

Sherman puts 
Campbell on the bus and hops in a 
cab to work, where he, a 
Master 
Universe, settles 
himself calmly 
amid 
chaos 
the bond 
trading 
room. 
'"Ho l y 
fucking 
shit.' How 
McCoy's 
Yaleness plays a large 
part in his image of himself, 
one of those tapped for an existence so 
elite as to completely absolve him of 
ordinary human responsibilities such 
as marital fidelity, kissing his beloved 
Campbell goodnight, or stopping his 
car after hitting a 
pedestrian. 

universities, 
these legatees of 
Jefferson, Emerson, 
Thoreau, William James, 
Frederick Jackson Turner, William 
Lyon Phelps, Samuel Flagg Bemis, and 
the other three-name giants of 
American scholarship-how these; 
inheritors of the lux and the veritas 
now flocked to Wall Street .... Masters 
of the Universe! The roar filled 
Sherman's soul with hope, confidence, 
esprit de corps and righteousness. Yes, 
righteousness!" 

Wolfe sets Sherman up for a fall 
from his Yale· eminence. Sherman 
takes a wrong turn off the T riboro 
Bridge into the Bronx on his way back 
into Manhattan after picking up his 
mistress at the airport. While his mis-
tress is driving, the car strikes a young 
man. They drive away, although 
Sherman suspects that they have h ie 
the young man. In a Stoveresque spirit 
of fair play, Sherman wants to call the 
police, but his mistress dissuades him. 
Sherman's Universe falls apart as 
he is arrested and tried for reckless 
endangerment while the youth he hit 
lies in a coma, expected to die. 

Sherman's Yale chin does nor protect 
him from his wife's wrath, or the 
District Attorney's use of h is case for 
political purposes, or the tabloid jour-
nalism of an alcoholic reporter crying 
to hold on to his job. Everyone wants 
a part in taking down the Yale Man. 

As his ordeal drags on, Sherman, 
who has lost everything, surrenders his 
Yaleness and renounces the faith. 'Tm 
not Sherman McCoy anymore," he 
tells his attorney. "I'm somebody else 
without a proper name. I've been that 
other person since the day I was arrest-
ed ... I'm somebody else. I have noth-
ing to do with Wall Street or Park 
Avenue or Yale or St. Paul's or 
Buckley ... "
