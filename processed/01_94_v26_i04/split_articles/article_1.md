,, T
he only 'A' you need is the 'A' in Yale," said a 
Yale student to one of our writers this past sum-
mer, echoing an oft-repeated if cynical view on 
campus, that we pay for the name-and the image-as 
much as for the education. Many of us come 
here with stars in our eyes, hoping to par-
take of an American legend: an acade-
my; bound in traditions older than 
this nation, that could turn us 
into presidents and potentates, 
renowned 
scholars 
or 
respected practicioners of 
the arts, simply through 
the mystical resonance of 
its name. 

When we arrive, 
however, we d iscover 
that there are two kinds 
of Yale, the mythic and 
the quotidian. The image 
of a campus populated by 
the young William Howard 
Tafts or Nathan Hales and 
led by Nobel laureates or poet-
philosophers gives way to the 
day-to-day cycle of classes, office 
work, study, research, socializing, 
meetings, and so on. Only within this uni-
versity community do we find those who have 
come to the same realization: our imagined Yale is more real 
off-campus than on-. 

How those who are outside Yale in some way see this 
university is the subject of this theme issue. We sent our 
writers as far from our daily Yale as we could, to see if they 
could discover how Yale looks from the outside. Kate 
Schuler talked to children and staff at the Dixwell Q House 
about how some in the New Haven community perceive 
the Yale they encounter. Elena Cherney hit the books to 
characterize the enduring image of the "Yale Man" i~ litera-
ture. Caroline Kim asked some in Yale's first class of under-
graduate women how they saw Yale when they 
were here, and how they see Yale now. Clare 
Connors also talked to alumni, who 
have come back to study at the Yale 
they once knew, about their per-
ceptions of a changed and 
changing university. And Jay 
Porter rounds out the issue 
with a personal look at the 
image of Yale as a gay 
school. 

We realize that we enter 
largely uncharted territory 
by examining others' per-
ceptions of Yale-invading 
the realm of impressions 
and ideas, of prejudices and 
preconceptions. An issue on 
such a wide-ranging and com-
plex topic can never pretend to 
be comprehensive, and so we pre-
sent, without apology, a patchwork 
of images that coexist as well as conflict: 
traditional, liberal, elitist, egalitarian, homo-
geneous, diverse, straight-laced, queer. We hope to 
spark some thoughts about the Yale image, the Yale mys-
tique-because the mythic Yale will be a Yale we will live 
with long after we have left campus. "Who the hell do you 
Yalies think you are?" is the question sometimes posed by 
those with a less-than-complimentary picture of Yale. We 
answer: We're not sure. You tell us.
