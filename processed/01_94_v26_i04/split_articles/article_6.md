sidetracked to Princeton and 
Harvard." 
Trillin points out the incongruity of 
this conversation with the Yale he knew 
in the 50s and the one we know today, 
but goes on to reflect that "the more I 
think about it, the more I think that we 
were closer to the world inhabited by 
Dink ... than we were to the world of 
today's undergraduates." 
Hansen was anointed the king of a 
realm out of sync with the real world. 
As the best Yale Man of the 50s, he 
had to succeed if anyone else even 
hoped to. Yet he failed. In his 
book, Trillin attempts 
to confront the ter-
rifying truths of 
Hansen ' s 
decline. 
did not become 
President. Although 
he held a chair at the Johns 
Hopkins School of lnternation 
Studies, he had not published a book 
since the 70s, and he did not get along 
with his colleagues. He was alone; he 
was not in touch with any of his friends 
from college; he had no family. He was 
depressed, and suffered from chronic 
back trouble. 
Trillin has been taken to task by 
numerous reviewers for the assumption 
that underpins his entire project, name 
ly, that Hansen's life was so starkly a 
failure. Some have pointed out that 
Hansen only failed if the presidency 
was the mark of success; the man did, 
after all, hold a chair at a major univer-
sity. Reviewers have also criticized 
Trillin's treatment of Hansen's homo-
sexuality, which Trillin only explores at 
the end of the book. 
What emerges from these reviews 
is a questioning of the myth Denny 
upheld as a college student. The end 
Denny seemed to promise, the shining, 
all-American happy ending, was not 
realistic. It was a dream of the 50s, like 
the missile gap and the happy house-
wife. The Yale Man of these years lived 
an illusory beginning our age cannot 
match in ending. 
Trillin observes in 
Denny that no man 
of his genera-
tion, Yale or 
otherwise, 
as

the Oval Office,

Boomers, men and women ten years 
younger, men and women like Bill and 
Hillary Clinton and their friends. 
Perhaps the Men of the 50s simply 
could not adjust to a world in which 
there is no Yale Man. Instead, in Denny, 
they gather in a living room in a scene 
Trillin calls "The Big Chill," and try to 
piece together what happened to their 
hero, the best and brightest of them. 
The explosion of the Yale Man, 
tragic as it is to those who believed in 
him, opens the way for the fulfillment
