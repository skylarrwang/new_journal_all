N i n a 
Glickson 
(DC '73), 
associate 
director of 
programs 
at the Yale 
Alumni 
Affairs 
office. "I 
felt I was 
in for an 
adven-
ture. " 
Rabbi 
Portnoy, 
who was a 
N 
e 
w 
Haven res-
ident 
at 
the 
time 
s 
h 
applied, 
admits 
that 
she 
did 
not 
have much 
of a con-
ception of 
Yale before 
got 
there. 
"How could I possibly not go? It was Yale," she says. Rabbi 
Portnoy, as a "townie," says she never gave Yale much 
thought while growing up, although she had seen many 
Yalies. "The biggest joke used to be about how many points 
we could score by running down Yalies with our cars," she 
laughs. 
For some women, older family members influenced 
their conception ofYale. Diana Brooks (PC '72), President 
of Sotheby's and a member of the Yale Corporation, was 
part of a "devoted Yale family," with her father, brothers, 
uhcles, and cousins as Yale graduates. She thought there 
was no other university that she would rather attend; "I 
loved Yale," she said, "I was there all the time from when I 
was a little girl." 


On the other hand, Cynthia Blum (MC '72), learned 
JANUARY 28, 1994 
from her father that Yale had a somewhat conservative and 
class-conscious social atmosphere when he was a student. 
"My father had gone to Yale on financial aid and had to 
work in the kitchen. At that time, people who worked in 
the kitchen were looked down on," she recalls. "But that 
was no longer the case when I got there." Blum, a graduate 
of Harvard Law School and now a tax law professor at 
Rutgers University, transferred to Yale after a year at 
Barnard. 
Glickson also had some ideas of Yale as a snooty, tradi-
tion-bound school. "I think a lot of people still do. But 
that's a very stilted view. It has no relation to reality, because 
when you get here, it's not true," she comments. "I found 
that the people were all so interesting and diverse." 
Judith Albert {BR '72), vice-president of the Latin 
American corporate finance group at J.P. Morgan, trans-
ferred to Yale after a year at Cornell. Shortly after she was 
accepted to Yale, she visited the campus and was impressed 
with the way the administration handled campus agitation 
at a time when riots and sit-ins were regular occurences on 
university campuses. "I was impressed because the atmo-
sphere was more pro-active and civilized," she says, "where-
as the Cornell campus was explosive, and the administra-
tion was reactive. At Cornell, we had something like 8,000 
students taking over buildings, and the whole time the 
administration took an authoritarian approach, threatening 
students in a disciplinarian way ... At Yale, Brewster went to 
the dining halls to talk to the students. He said he would 
talk to any students about anything, as long as they sched-
uled an appointment. I was impressed that the administra-
tion was willing to listen to the students, as long as they 
adhered to the civilized terms of the system." 


In the fall of 1969, these women finally met the reali-
ties of undergraduate life as the pioneers of coeducation at 
Yale College. "I realized that this was a man's university," 
says Glickson. "I always felt that there were not enough 
women." She feels that the administration handled the first 
year of coeducation well. She did, however, encounter some 
difficulties. "There were so many things they had just never 
thought of," she pauses, "like sports." Not only did the 
women have to organize their own sports, but none of the 
male staff of the Yale Daily News would cover women's 
events. In addition, Glickson says with a slight smile, "We 
could never find a ladies' room. I remember we always had 
to tun all the way to the second floor to fmd one." 
Did these women feel at all like outsiders? Blum recalls 
that although some seniors resented the arrival the new 
women, most male students were quite accepting. Judith 
Albert recalls, "I didn't feel like an outsider any more than 
any other new place might have made me feel." 


Regardless of how accommodating most students were, 
there were still some Yale men who apparently felt that 
THE NEW jOURNAL 13 


these new Yalies were allowed a special 
privilege to attend Yale. Mary Corliss 
Pearl (SY '72), executive director of 
Wildlife Preservation Trust, refused to 
feel like an outsider at Yale. "I remem-
ber one professor getting really angry 
at me," she chuckles. "I said I didn't 
like the class atmosphere because there 
were so few women in each class. I 
mean the ratio of women to men was 
pathetic. I said it was somewhat of a 
hostile environment to contribute in 
class discussion. This infuriated him. I 
mean, who was I to complain?" she 
laughs. "This was a rare privilege!. .. But 
I felt that if I was at Yale as a regular 
student, there was nothing that 
shouldn't come my way." 


In the eyes of some of Yale's first 
class of women, the disproportionately 
small female population not only 
made for awkward class dynamics, but 
also hindered networking and group 
collaboration among women at the 
time. "Feminism was young and 
fresh," Judith Albert says, "There was 
little solidarity among women. Our 
buddies were guys, and it was as true 
for preps as it was for radicals." Albert 
expresses the complexities of the coed-
ucational experience for women. "I 
never would have admitted it at the 
time, but looking back, I feel some-
thing was missing that I didn't find 
until later .... Quite a few women didn't 
come out fully whole to the point at 
which you could be confideP.t in your 
right to be. As a woman in a largely 
male environment, it takes a little bit 
more to stand out, and I think women 
who went to an environment where 
they didn't have to deal with so many 
men had more of an opportunity to 
develop and express their own 
thoughts." 


M
w years back, former presi-
nt Benno Schmidt (TC '63, 
Y/1 '66) called Yale's decision 
to go coed the best decision Yale has 
ever made. Today's campus, with its . 
42.4 percent female population, stands 
jANUARY 28, 1994 


in sharp conrrast to the 1969 Yale, 
with eight men to every woman. As 
graduates of Yale College who now see 
the school from the outside, these 
women express their views and some 
specific concerns about issues that may 
affect the future of Yale. 
Corliss Pearl views the splin-
tering of the student body 
into small special inter-
est groups as prob-
lematic. "When I 
was 
Yale, 
those of us who 
were outsiders 
going to Yale 
were quick to 
embrace the 
community 
rather 
than 
emphasize how 
we were differ-
ent," she explains, 
"I guess I don't like 
to cast myself as a vic-
tim." 


On the economic side, Rabbi 
Portnoy worries about the rising cost 
of a Yale education. 7I might one day 
want to send my children to Yale, but I 
worry because the tuition rises each 
year," she says. "I hope this does not 
cause Yale to become a place only for 
the rich elite again. I don't mean the 
academic elite, because I strongly 
believe in strict standards of excellence 
in education, but I don't believe it 
should be limited to the upper class." 
In comparison to the $2,350 tuition 
she paid in the late 60s, today's price 
tag of $18,000 might cause pepple to 
write offYale as too expensive. 


Yale Corporation member Brooks 
believes that, "New H aven is the uni-
versity's biggest challenge." With the 
rise in homelessness and crime rates, 
town-gown issues are of great concern. 
Similarly, Corliss Pearl remarks, "We 
didn't have very many locked gates, 
but now there's probably a lot more 
conrrol...that really saddens me. 
Students are still active in the commu-
nity but they're dealing with horrible 
problems now, like AIDS and crack." 


Brooks also decried the problems 
with freedom of speech and thought in 
the academy: "Political correctness is a 
real danger," she says. She believes Yale 
ought to remain a place for freedom of 
expression and exploration of 
ideas. She continues, "My 
hopes for Yale are 
many-that 
it 
remain in the 
forefront of lib-
eral 
educa-
tion ... that it 
play a leader-
ship role ... 
that it be 
fearless in its 
willingness to 
change, 
to 
adapt to new 
ideas without los-
ing sight of our 
past, and our great his-
tory and traditions." 


Rabbi Portnoy recalls the reac-
tions of people when they discover she 
is a Yalie, "It's still impressive as hell. 
People often say, 'Gee, you must be 
smart, you went to Yale.'" Some peo-
ple become defensive, adds Albert, and 
"try to cut you down. They think, 
'Who do you think you are with your 
Yale degree?"' 


Corliss Pearl reveals another type 
of response to a Yale woman. "It's been 
a help in my career. Especially because 
women and minorities need that kind 
of extra assistance," she says. "I always 
advise women to get the highest degree 
possible because in the work force, it's 
much harder for women and minori-
ties, and I've always thought that this 
high establishment credential has 
helped me as a woman." 


Despite some of the difficulties of 
being among the first women at Yale 
College, Albert, Portnoy, Corliss Pearl, 
Glickson, and Brooks feel enthusiastic 
about Yale and support its standards of 
excellence. Brooks believes that "Yale
