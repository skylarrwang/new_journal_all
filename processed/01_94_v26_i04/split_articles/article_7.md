ale undergraduate recruiting ftlm in the 1950s: the 
rilliant sun beams across the freshly-manicured 
wn of Old Campus. A tall, clean-cut Yale man in a 
crisp suit strolls over the flagstones. With a white-gloved 
young lady on one arm, he holds her overnight bag with his 
. free hand. A sonorous male voice speaks of the "Yale man's" 
active social life. The subtitle flashes onto the screen: "To Be 
a Man." 
Gone are the days of the Yale man with jacket, tie, and 
white-gloved lady in tow. Long past are the days of mixers 
and carloads of "weekend women" (as one of Yale's first 
female undergraduates put it) imported from Vassar and 
Smith. Nowadays, a sunny day on Old Campus brings 
upbeat music blaring out of a window, men and women 
sprawled on the grass in cut-offs, and perhaps a game of co-
ed ultimate Frisbee. Yale has come a long way from a tradi-
tional, all-male institution, reminiscent of old Oxford and 
Cambridge. 
. 
At a time when "Old Yale" -and- the rest of the coun-
try-was being shaken to its foundations, tQ.e arriv~l of 
women at Yale College exemplified the spirit of change. 
Rabbi Mindy Porrnoy (TC '73) recalls, "Everyone was try-
ing to be an outsider .... Everybody wore ripped jeans-no 
one wanted to be the 'quintessential Yalie.' ... Everyone had 
to rethink their roles, even the old school boy nerwork style, 
who we learned not to take too seriously because we knew 
they'd just end up doing what their daddies did." The 
arrival of women into Yale College represented one of the 
challenges to the old school boy notion of following what 
"daddy did," for Yale was no longer simply a place of 
"school boys." Some of the women who parricipated in this 
transformation tell us how they saw Yale-then and now. 
C
oeducation began well before 1969. Women first 
studied in Yale graduate programs as early as the late 
1800s. The School of the Fine Arts was the first 
coeducational graduate program, while the Graduate 
School of Arts and Sciences began to admit women in 
1892. In 1886, Alice Rufie Blake Jordan was the first 
woman to receive a Yale law degree; because she applied 
using her initials, admissions officials assumed she was a 
man. The administration subsequently revised rules for 
admission, and no women officially enrolled until 1919. 
In the 1960s, liberal tides swept across college campuses 
in America and Europe. Yale found itself in the midst of 
change in marrers ranging from dress codes to socio-politi-
cal thought. By the late 60s, Yale was more than ready to 
accept women into its undergraduate program. In the fall of 
1968, a few weeks after Princeton announced its decision to 
go coed, Yale followed suit. The following September, after 
268 years of all-male Yale, the school opened its gates to 
nearly 700 women-230 first-year students and 358 trans-

Mory's did not allow women as members until 197 4, effec-
tively preventing women from hosting activities there on 
their own. Then-president Kingman Brewster, in a speech . 
to Yale alumni, announced that he would not reduce the 
number of men admitted because Yale had an obligation to 
the country to produce 1,000 leaders each year-apparently 
he did not think these women, or "intellectual amazons," as 
the press called them, could be leaders.

Yale's offer of admission. "I chink a lot of us were young and
