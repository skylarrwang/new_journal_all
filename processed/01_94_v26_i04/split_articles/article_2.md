Yale's austere Gothic buildings dwarf passersby. 
Colorful posters plaster gates and kiosks for singing 
group jams, political forums, and theater produc-
tions. The intersection of Elm and High Street, the center 
1 of Yale's campus, bustles with purposeful students who have 
~ seemingly little regard for the local traffic. 


A mere three blocks north, boarded up buildings, dilap-
idated tenements, storefront churches, and funeral homes 
line pothole-marked Dixwell Avenue. In the center of the 
Dixwell neighborhood, graffiti-covered plywood blocks the 
entry to a closed library. A busy intersection attracts clusters 
of teenagers who idly observe pa$sing cars. 

Yale students generally shy away from the Dixwell area: 
.£ The literature and safety workshops Yale uses to educate 
c about New Haven make students all too aware of the dan-
~ 
gers of attending school in a city. Many students envision 
crime, drugs, or gang violence lurking beyond the sacred 
boundaries of the blue phones. Students rarely jog or ride 
their bikes in Dixwell, opting instead for the safety of 
Prospect Street. Few students venture north past Payne 
Whitney Gymnasium, the last Yale edifice before Dixwell 
Avenue merges with familiar Broadway. 

While Yale students shun the Dixwell area, the resi-
dents of Dixwell cannot block Yale's presence from their 
city. The fortress of Old Campus and the cast-iron gates of 
the residential colleges establish and maintain the division 
between Yale and New Haven. Yale, one-time home to 
George Bush (DC '48) and Bill Clinton (LAW '73), seems 
to many New Haven residents a powerful assembly line for 
the production of the country's leaders. According to one 
Dixwell resident, most of his neighbors look at Yale stu-
dents and "don't see middle class distinctions; all they see is 
rich, white. They see so few blacks" among Yale students. 

Dixwell residents rarely feel that their world and the 
world of Yale meet on equal ground. The Dixwell 
Community Q House allows a chance for stereotypes of 
Yale and Dixwell to break down. The Q House sponsors 
daycare and educational programs, and provides outreach 
programs like teen drop-in centers, food distribution, sup-
port groups for parents, peer counseling, and summer 
camps. In an after-school program, 36 Yale students tutor 
and help supervise· the children who use the facility. While 
both Yale students and Dixwell residents approach the pro-
gram with preconceived ideas about the "other," they often 
take away new perspectives. 

Diane Brown, program supervisor of the Q House, 
explains that more negative comments about Yale come 
from Dixwell residents who have not spent time with Yale 
students. "I hear people talking about 
those rich, white ... " Her voice trails off; 
she is reluctant to repeat the words peo-
ple use to describe Yale students. Often, 
the pervading perception ofYale students 
is of their wealth, Brown says. Dixwell 
residents' perception of Yale as a bastion 
of privilege makes it difficult for them to 
believe chat Yalies actually work. Brown 
tells of a Yale volunteer who left the cen-
ter early one afternoon, explaining that 
she had to study for an exam. "One little 
boy was amazed and said to her, 'You 
don't need to study, you go to Yale.' This 
is what the kids think. They're surprised 
to find out [Yalies] work hard." 

The image ofYale students as the 
idle rich disintegrates as the kids and volunteers spend time 
together. "It's good when the kids hear that the student may 
only have one pair of jeans because they can't afford to buy 
more," Brown comments. "I hear tutors telling the kids 
about their part-time jobs to help pay for school." 

Brown focuses on the black Yale students who visit the 
Q House as particularly important in challenging stereo-
types. "The kids here need someone to say to them, 'Look 
I'm black, and I go to Yale." 

What the kids at the Q House say about their tutors 
supports Brown's observations. Alicia, 10, is a four-year vet-
eran of the Q. Before she came to the Q House, she 
thought all Yale students were rich and snobbish. Alicia has 
changed her opinion, but comments, "My friends at school 
still think that." Alicia suggested planning a party to thank 
the Yale volunteers. "They help me a lot with my home-
work, and they play with us," she says. Six-year-old Parris 
concurs. Wearing her dark green school uniform, her eyes 
wide with energy, she speaks freely of her affection for the 
volunteers. "I love them because they help me, and when 
they're done they help other people. It's very nice," she says 
with conviction. 

While Yale volunteers go some distance in dispelling 
their elitist image, not all New Haven residents are con-
vinced of the sincerity of their volunteering. The drive and 
ambition of Yale students can lead to assumptions 
that students are simply padding their resumes. 

"I can see a lack of zeal, a sense of just going 
with the flow," says Zaid Qawiyy, the edu-
cational specialist at the center. 

Yale volunteers may have to over-
come this suspicion. Many of the com-
munity residents may not realize the 
time constraints or the difficulties Yale 
students often must resolve. Brown's 
experiences with the volunteers reveal 
that most of the students act selflessly 
when they volunteer. "These volunteers 
are giving their time when they could be 
studying or working at a part-time job. They 
put up with my strict rules, and I can make it 
hard for them. They're not getting school credit 
for it, no one's pushing them to do this. It's a very pos-
itive thing," Brown asserts, clearly impressed with and 
proud of the Yale students she knows. Before Christmas, the 
volunteers gave the kids a goodbye parry, paid for out of 
their own pockets. The kids like the Yale volunteers, often 
picking favorites or even refusing to work until a certain 
tutor helps them. "Kids can tell when they're being treated 
right," says Brown. 

Cynthia, 8, describes her impression of the university. 
"I think it must be fun. They have machines that give you 
candy, and lots of computers." To her this seems out of 
reach. "Also, they get a lot of attention there. Our schools 
don't give us any attention," she says. 

T
he interaction at the Q H. ouse also revises the image 
Yale students have of Dixwell. "This is the first time 
most of these Yale students have been around a pre-
dominantly black neighborhood,, Brown comments. Some 


Yale students come to the center with 
the notion that children in the poverty-rid-
den inner city have little or no future except a life of 
drugs and crime. "The national media is constantly show-
ing the bad," she says, "the broken homes, the mothers who 
are junkies." 

The volunteers often talk to Brown about their initial 
misconceptions. "They tell me, 'Diane, I didn't expect to 
see fath~rs,' or they're shocked to see some of these kids get-
ting As and Bs on their report cards." Brown is pleased that 
the Yale students are helping to spread the word that things 
are not all that bleak. 

It is impossible to deny that Yale has its advantages. In 
the end, the differences between Yale students and the peo-
ple in the Dixwell community prove decisive. "Anyone who 
graduates from Yale is going to be influential," Brown 
explains. "I just hope that when they go out in the world 
that they don't forget us and the things they saw here." IIBJ
