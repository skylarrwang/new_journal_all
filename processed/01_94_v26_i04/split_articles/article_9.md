Nostalgia overwhelmed him as he once again strolled through the Woolsey Rotunda-as much a student as the 20-year olds bustling about him. More than 50 years after graduating from Yale, Maxfield S. Gibbons (TD '45W) felt ready to embark upon his second Yale experience. Like other members of the accelerated wartime class of 1945, Gibbons sped through his undergraduate career in order to join the war effort. "To tell you the truth," said Gibbons, "my education at Yale was a bad one. The administration was more worried about keeping the place glued together and finding turnips to feed the undergraduates." Now, Gibbons is back for more than just his turnip ration.

Gibbons is one of a unique group of alums who, either after retirement or while still fully employed, has again become actively involved in the undergraduate community. Unlike most former Yalies, Gibbons has assumed the role of student and not simply that of a revered source of opinions or money. As a participant in an innovative program called Term Time, he pays a fee for each class he attends and chooses any course he wants. Although he must secure the permission of the seminar instructors, he can take part in discussions, attend sections, and even work with the faculty on a one-to-one basis. Football games, tailgates, cocktail parties, and fancy dinners-these comprise the usual fare of the alumni experience. Designed to impress, as well as to rekindle memories of"Bright College Years," these gatherings aim to reconnect former students with the present university and to secure the monetary commitment of the alumni.


But while some alumni organizations plan their social event calendars for the forthcoming year, other alumni programs have a somewhat different agenda--one linked with what some believe is more in line with the actual purpose of a university education. As one of the pioneers in the business of providing educational opportunities for alumni, Yale became the first university to devise a program by which alumni could come back as undergraduate students.


Because of Yale's preoccupation with the war, Gibbons could select virtually any class he desired. As an English major, he took nothing but literature courses. After retiring from a successful career in journalism and advertising, Gibbons traveled extensively. But while exploring the temples of Athens, Gibbons began to regret not having taken any history courses in college. So he came back to Yale, enrolled in Term Time, and signed up for a team-taught course called Periclean Athens. Setting a rather different example from most Term Timers, Gibbons decided to take his course for credit rather than auditing it. "I just wanted to see if I could do it," he insisted. Eight years later, Gibbons would still be taking courses for credit if his doctors had not told him to cool it. Despite recurring heart problems, he faithfully attended David Montgomery's course on the Civil War and Reconstruction. Unlike most students, he misses writing the papers, but like other Yalies complains that he is behind in his reading. Gibbons realizes that this too adds to the experience. "It makes me a true undergraduate," he said.


Although experiences vary significantly between returning veteran undergraduates, their general response appears to be one of overwhelming enthusiasm. Like Gibbons, many Term Timers consider this program a perfect opportunity to fill in the gaps in their academic pursuits. For instance, Peter West (DC '53) studied industrial engineering the first time around. Now, after participating in the program for five years, he has been hailed by friends as a foremost expert on Renaissance Art.


Raleigh D'Adamo (SM '53) uses the Term Tune program to add to the catalogue of languages which he has studied. He has attended classes in the morning, as well as in the evening after work. Among other things, he has audited three language courses-Swahili, Zulu, as well as a course on Egyptian Hieroglyphics. "It saves me from a simple and ordinary existence," said D 'Adamo, who is currently studying Arabic.


Simple and ordinary surely does not describe the experience of Neil Lombardi OE '49), and his wife, Ann. They participated in the program in the fall term of 1991. Lombardi, a lawyer from Kansas who learned about Term Time at a cocktail party, was beset by the extra task of finding satisfactory living arrangements.


Once situated in New Haven, Lombardi and his wife perused the blue book. "Our approach was that the professor was more important than the subject matter," he wrote in a term paper submitted to the Association of Yale Alumni. (AYA) While shopping classes he happened upon a Yale legend. "I walked into this class and found the professor leaning on his elbows across the broad seminar table with the pained and disheveled look of a man who has just gotten out of bed and doesn't like it," he wrote. "I had lucked onto Harold Bloom."


Lombardi also expounded on the student body. "They were a diverse, handsome, and lively group," he said. "[They] seemed to be both serious and full of fun." After much thought, the Lombardis decided not to don the rather "eccentric" outfit of the 90s college student. "If they regarded us as ancient oddballs, they were tactful about it, and gave us only an occasional quizzical glance," wrote Lombardi.


Despite almost being run over by a unicycle and two skateboards, Lombardi had few qualms about the current undergraduates. The impartiality with which he recounted information posted at Ashley's, however, revealed perhaps the aspects of Yale which Lombardi found most altered and "contemporary." Notices for Homicidal Lesbian Terrorists, African drumming workshops, and a group called Born Against highlighted his rather outlandish list.


In contrast to the variety of activities announced by the posters, certain student organizations remained Yale staples. "The Yale Daily News has a mixture of genuinely thoughtful editorials and gratuitously sarcastic criticism of the administration," Lombardi marveled."No change here from the 40s."


So then what has changed since these alums were students? West and his wife enrolled in the program at the same time that the youngest of their three children, Stuart West (DC '92), was also an undergraduate. The three family members found themselves reunited weekly in John Boswell's lectures on the Middle Ages. A family affair? The elder West says that the experience offered him an entirely different perspective. "We were on the same wavelength. "


Although West believes students might have been more strongly motivated in his day, he still finds present Yalies bright and eager. Though still bright and eager, the Yale student body of today no longer remains the exclusive, fraternal club that most alums remember. "Men bonding as men-there's no substitute for the camaraderie," said the language connoisseur, D 'Adamo. Nevertheless he believes that the presence of women allows for a more natural existence. West also hails admitting women as a tremendous improvement. "The whole place has a completely different type of feeling," he said.


While applauding the increased diversity of the student body, some alumni lament the crumbling residential college system. "I decry the growing number of off-campus undergraduates because it reduces Yale and its benefits to the community," D'Adamo said. Soon, he fears, Yale might resemble the European system where students come only for their classes. He believes that the college system engenders a loyalty to Yale that suffers if one does not fully participate.


Since D' Adamo enrolled in Term Time, he himself has worked to stem this trend. Once again he has become deeply involved with his former college, Silliman. In addition to supplying the college's print shop with valuable and technologically up-to-date equipment, D'Adamo is also willing to assist whenever extra help or expertise is needed. As an associate fellow of Davenport College, he also enjoys spending mealtimes with students and has on occasion invited students to his home for dinner.


But D 'Adamo feels saddened by the deterioration of propriety among students since his days at Yale. "Perhaps too much was tossed out in the 60s," he said. "Students have lost a certain amount of refinement-not snobbishness, but things such as dining room manners and higher methods of dress." Nevertheless, these surface criticisms belie his continuing admiration for today's Yalies. He considers the present college students a great inspiration. "If this is what the
