What am I supposed to do now?" 
"Go back to your office," I said, "and 
pound away at your book. I'm going 
home." 

With the wind, the snow, the freezing 
cold, I should have been icebound even 
through my coat. But I wasn't. I was flam-
ing hot with shame-for Yoke and 
Blondie, for Holmann, for the fat boy, but 
most of all for my repulsive, disgusting 
self. Go ahead and die, Hartspring. Turn 
into a big beanshaped chunk of gristle. It's 
the best thing by far. For I saw in Yoke a 
gross, animal stupidity which masqueraded 
as the diabolical cunning of intelligence. 
He, who apparently believed he acted 
with purpose according to some tran-
scendent ideal of art in a vicious universe, 
who even employed "advanced tech-
nology" to gain his ends, had in reality no 
purpose and no ends beyond the malicious 
exploitation of the moment. Up there in 
Blondie's window, forcing the life-giving 
act to destroy life, Yoke seemed controlled 
by a madness (hideous in someone so 
young) which subverted what intelligence 
he possessed. While I-who seemed pas-
sively caught in his trap-was in fact solely 
responsible for setting that trap and for-
cing the recalcitrant mechanism until it 
worked. I was ashamed of Yoke's insanity 
which he could perhaps not control. But 
I felt more shame and terror for my self-
willed collaboration in it: as if this weird 
bond revealed the best and worst in us all, 
a Jove of creation inseparably coupled with 
a crazed lust for death. 

Santa Claus brought the Hartsprings a 
meager Christmas. It might have been 
Jess meager had the fuel company not 
stopped delivering oil for nonpayment of 
bill. One morning shortly before Christ-
mas, I had just awakened and my nerves 
were transmitting my body's usual morn-
ing reflex of sliding across the bed toward 
Mona and taking a little Creature· Comfort 
-when I discovered that I could not move. 
I was naked, as usual. As usual, Mona had 
pulled all the covers off me in her sleep. 
But for a pleasant change, the temperature 
in the room must have dropped to thirty 
degrees. I was frozen stiff. My nerves could 
not even send blood racing to my prick, 
and it lay there like Old Dog Tray on his 
master's grave. At least I could move my 
eyeballs; for several minutes, without 
glasses (for the moisture on my eyeballs 
must have frozen to lenses), I scanned all 
the spots where paint was flaking from 
our ceiling-until it dawned on me that I 
was slowly freezing to death. I tried to 
holler out. My tongue felt like a dead clam, 
and my jaws had rusted like the Tin 
Woodsman's of Oz. But I did manage to 
croak, "Mo-na." 

"Mmmf," Mona grunted. I heard her 
stirring. I was beyond feeling anything. 
"Mo-na." 

Mona began mumbling. Listening hard, 
I made out something like, "Hartspring, 
I need some new dresses. All my old ones 
are rotting at the armpits. Santa, my 
children need warm sweaters. All my 
panties have holes in them. My husband 
never lets me sleep. We can't afford an-
other baby . .. " 

"Mo ... na." 

"What-? Time'st?" 

Her big, warm, lucky body rustled 
around a few moments beneath the covers. 
A shadow appeared in my right eye. Then 
suddenly Mona's sleep-swollen face was 
hanging directly over mine and she was 
looking into my eyes. "What the hell is 
wrong with you?" 

I could not be certain, but I thought 
one of her hands might be exploring my 
body for rigor mortis. 

"Hartspring! Are you dead?" 

I rolled my eyeballs. My jaw would no 
longer move. Even my vision began to 
dim, and I knew what it must be like to 
stare up through the surface of a frozen 
pond at the sky. Something big seemed 
to hit me. And as the writers of detective 
stories used to say, everything went black. 

My next sensation was a hundred mil· 
lion little needles pricking me everywhere. 
My eyes were open. Perhaps they were 
open all the time, only now I was beginning 
to see again. I must have moved, beca'\JSe 
Mona said, "It's about time, damn it. 
You're like cuddling up against Frosty the 
Snowman." 

Then at last through all the needles I felt 
Mona's soft, naked body, and I was over 
the hump, fished like Houdini out of the 
hole in the ice; I began to warm up fast. 

Why did King David want those young 
female bodies flush against him in his old 
age to keep him warm? If ever it did occur 
to me to ask, I'll never ask again. And 
even you, Rimmler, with your chaste 
theories about unthawing frozen soldiers-
if only in the interests of science and 
health, I'll ask the world to forgive you a 
little. Because in five minutes Mona was 
breathing bard into my left ear, the blood 
had once again begun to rush, and Hart-
spring was still a man. 

"Oh oh. The kids!" I cried. 

"They're all right," sighed Mona. 

"But we've got to see!" 

"Please, Hartspring. Don't quit now. 
... Maybe you're not cured yet .... The 
kids are all right .... Their room is always 
cold .... They sleep in thermal under-
wear .... They aren't-stupid like you ... 
Hartspring." 

Later that morning, fully delivered and 
strutting like Chanticleer in spite of 
my fears of death, I managed to start our 
Henry J, piloted it to the fuel company 
office, and asked for the manager. 

"We were just trying to punish you," be 
said. "You haven't paid your bill for three 
months." 

Ruffling my plumage, I said, ''There's 
nothing immoral about owing money. 
Debtor's prison was abolished long ago. 
But there is something sinister and evil 
about trying, as you have done, to freeze 
three helpless children to death, not to 
mention my wife and myself." 

"But-" 

"You shut off service without so much 
as a hint to warn us." 

"But, sir, you could have checked your 
gauge." 

"When I went into my children's room 
this morning, they were so cold they 
couldn't even move." Actually they were 
in covers up to their ears and warm as 
toast. "Do you know how cold it was last 
night? It got down to five above zero. Five 
above zero! And I've got three kids and 
we must not have had any heat at all after 
eight in the evening. I'm a sick man, and 
my wife is pregnant. Twelve hours with· 
out heat before we woke up and dis-
covered what was wrong. Do you realize 
what can happen to a child when he kickS 
off his covers and lies there for hours in a 
room five above zero? He's lucky if he 
doesn't freeze to death. Well, you're the 
lucky one. The doctor says they'll live. 
But he also says I've got a perfect right to 
sue you for all you're worth, or at least 
~ 
report you to the Better Business Bureau. 
And on and on. 

We finally settled for payment of one 
back month, and they resumed service

immediately. But only one month took 
most of our Christmas cash. So Christmas 
morning around our fir was pretty bleak 
("Daddy, why didn't I get my Luger that 
shoots real caps?" "Daddy, why didn't I get 
my pelletgun so I can kill starlings?"). And 
New Year's was bleak, since we had not 
been invited to any parties and could not 
have afforded a babysitter anyway. But 
most bleak of all was the end of vacation 
and having to return to my office, to my 
classes, to my show girls who were back 
from their warm, cheery homes (I assume 
even Blondie and Brownie had parents), 
back with their torturers' whips oiled and 
ready once again to flay the back of Hart-
spring, who returned to uninterrupted 
thoughts of his impending doom. 

That is, Blondie was back, and Yoke. 
And weekends, they resumed flailing away 
until I sometimes saw, or thought I saw, 
the whole building vibrating back and 
forth, up and down. And yet their utter 
nonchalance! They even began putting 
their clothes back on in front of me, and 
for what it's worth, I noticed a pattern: 
Yoke always puts on his shirt first, before 
anything else, and the first thing Blondie 
always put on were her nylons. The pattern 
never changed. What did begin to change, 
~ however, was the relish with which they 
went about their act. Even before Christ-
mas holidays, I could tell that Blondie 
was becoming bored by it all; but now 
even Yoke appeared to be losing taste. 

It became more and more obvious that 
they were just trying to get it out of the 
way. You knew from their faces they were 
thinking, What a chore! Like the per-
formers I once saw in a stag movie at a 
friend's bachelor party: we were going 
wild, but you could tell that for them it 
was just a job. Once or twice Yoke even 
l'aOrted to the Old Standby-perhaps be-
cause that was the only position left which 
offered, even remotely, the promise of 
llpice. Toward the end of January, they'd 
come into the room, take off their clothes, 
tben shrug as if it were just too much, get 
dressed again, and leave. Finally, they did 
DOt even remove their clothes; they sat 
around, they talked, they drank, and 
SOinetimes Yoke would fool with some 
sort of device-I could not make out 
Jlrec:isely what-at the back of the room. 

One afternoon they even smiled to 
acknowledge my presence, and waved. Of 
COUrse I smiled back. But I knew that, 
having wearied of this phase in his little 
plot, Yoke would now devise another. I 
hoped it would be a good one. I was a tired 
Dian. I was in pain: my "cancer" not only 
bun now, it itched so much I writhed. 
I Wanted something definite to happen. 

And Brownie? Well, she was back, too, 
~gh not so violently back as her friend. 
ercurtains were open again. After the 
~tion, whenever she was in her room 
~appeared to spend much time lounging 
~nude, mooning around, sipping 
Coi n book. Her Christmas present from 
ntreau, and leafing through a large 
home? As you know, I had long felt 
Brownie to be a softer, more gentle spirit 
than her friend, perhaps motivated not so 
~~by the desire to destroy as by a 
~lfected desire to please. This impres-
~as 
strengthened by the contrast be-
·--o what occurred in the two windows. 
~in January while Yoke and Cynthia 
~were still rigorously developing 
_.voluntary muscles, Cynthia's 
~ie 
would at the same time be re-
~~ 
on the bed, reading, studying, 
~~ing, leafing through her brown 
-.&ner book. A sentimental brown study 
herself. She would even look up from time 
to time and flutter dove-eyes at me, senti-
mental dariing, though when I gestured 
recognition, she looked away. Was she 
privy to her friend's antics? I had never 
seen a man in Brownie's room. For that 
matter, I no longer saw Blondie there 
either.lf I had at least some acquaintance 
with the sad soul of Cynthia Potter, the 
soul of my brown-haired beauty-with 
the possible exception of Hubert's night on 
the Green-remained mysterious to me 
like the contents of her brown book. 

Sentimental Hart$pring! have you no 
toughmindedness in reserve to save your 
soul? 

Near the end of February when the 
cold weather was just beginning to abate, 
I sat in the undergraduate reserve room 
mugging up notes on Ezra Pound's first 
Canto so I could teach it with at least the 
appearance of understanding to my sem-
inar. The room was long and narrow with 
an enormously high ceiling. Individual 
stalls jammed side by side, and smoke 
drifted upward as if from a hundred little 
chimneys, collecting into a gray cloud fifty 
feet over our heads and dimming the lights. 
Down went Ezra Pound into hell all the 
time vigorously translating the Odyssey's 
Book of the Dead: "peopled cities covered 
with else-webbed mist, unpierced ever with 
glitter of sun-rays," I read, smelling stale 
wintercoats which everyone had worn 
into the room and shucked on chairbacks, 
coats which, like mine, had probably not 
been drycleaned since the previous April 
whereupon they were promptly stuffed into 
mothballs all summer and fall. "Souls out 
of Erebus, cadaverous dead, of brides of 
youths and of the old who had borne 
much; souls stained with recent tears, girls 
tender . .. I sat to keep off the impetuous 
impotent dead till I should bear Tiresias." 

A shade fell across the book before me 
(believe it or not! Am I responsible for the 
truth?)-that is, a shadow-and my 
peripheral vision caught a form, man or 
woman I could not tell, seating itself 
beside me. A coat was shucked against 
the chair back, and now (still without 
moving my eyes from the page) I un-
doubtedly identified an ample, sloping pair 
of female breasts under a tight sweater. 

"A second time? why? man of ill star," 
I read, "facing the sunless dead and this 
joyless region? Stand from the fosse .... " 

Beside me, I heard a startled intake of 
breath. I looked directly at my neighbor. 
You guessed it-why kid around? 

"You!" I whispered. 

Brownie and I, three feet apart at the 
most, sat staring into one another's eyes. 
Brown eyes she had, of course. 

First she hit me with a timid smile-
little teeth, but strong and white like 
Blondie's. Then she blushed. It was a 
bright, bloody blush. I saw it first when 
it hit her throat above the sweater's crew-
neck, but the blood started against the 
skin one bell of a lot lower down than that. 
Her breasts, even her thighs and belly, 
must have been glowing. And now like 
those big thermometers you see in 
animated cartoons, the red caught her 
chin, cheeks, ears, forehead; and under 
that long brown hair which reached the 
small of her back blood must have been 
bursting through the pores in her scalp. 

Decency! cried my brain with strange ex-
hilaration as my own thermometer began 
to blush and swell. She feels shame! A 
sense of right and wrong! Honor! Good-
ness! Love! How long had it been since 
these words had even occurred to me? 
My prick strained against the shiny 
fabric of my pants. 

The blush on Brownie's face meta-
morphosed into terror. "Restroom!" she 
whispered. The utterance must have been 
involuntary, a reflex action of her horrified 
subconscious to tear her away. or, like a 
frightened. ostrich, plunge her head in a 
ditch. Her chair rasped. Staring into my 
eyes as Venus must have stared through 
the net into Vulcan's, she rose from the 
stall. She turned her back on me. She 
rushed down the narrow aisle as if pursued 
by a cohort of bogies and out of the room. 
But she left her coat against the chair's 
backside. And she left her books. 

Momentarily in shock, I looked back 
at old Ez. "Venerandam, in the Cretan's 
phrase, with the golden crown, Aphrodite, 
Cy pri munimenta sort ita est, mirthful, 
oricalchi, with golden girdle and breast 
bands, thou with dark eyelids bearing the 
golden bough ... " Waht the hell did all 
that Latin mean? I reached for a large 
mimeographed volume which generally 
answered that sort of idiot's question-
when suddenly on the stall beside me under 
three volumes of Proust in French, I 
recognized the big, brown, leather book 
I had watched Brownie leafing through 
since the end of the Christmas holidays. 

No hesitation. Shoving Proust off its top, 
I plopped the thing into my lap and spread 
it apart at the middle. The picture made me 
gasp. For it was an expensive album of 
eight-by-ten photographs, superbly in 
focus, superbly printed on the finest paper, 
superbly mounted under clear pools of 
mica, superbly posed. Pictures of whom? 
Of Brownie herself. Solo. Perhaps the 
most macabre object on which I have ever 
rested my jaded eyeballs, more so even 
than Yoke's plumbing of Cynthia Potter. 

The first picture I saw-indeed, as I 
discovered, all the pictures-must have 
been taken in April. Out of focus in the 
background, two or three trees appeared 
to be in blossom. Beyond the trees across 
the whole picture stood one of those 
ancient stone fences which farmers once 
made by removing rocks from their land. 
The ground gloomed in decay: bare earth, 
scraggly grass, hardy weeds and a few 
wildflowers illuminated sporadically by 
mottled, treebroken sunrays, themselves 
visible in the picture at a right-to-left slant. 
In the picture's foreground stood an old 
tombstone rounded at the top. WILLIAM 
MOON, 1790-1865, HIS WIFE DIANA, 
1801-1890, THEBESTISYETTOBE. 
Other old stones of the same design but 
out of focus studded the picture's back-
ground. Bent languidly in profile above the 
tombstone of Mr. and Mrs. Moon, nipples 
just brushing its lichened top, right band 
stroking its side, staring sentimentally into 
the lens like a dreamy Victorian belle 
stood Brownie. Nude. The focus was so 
good I could make out the down on her 
thighs. Her os pubis rested against the 
stone's side. On and on I leafed. All the 
other pictures, I guessed, had been taken 
the same day; in some, the sun cast its rays 
from left to right; in others they struck 
earth at right angles, and in one superb 
picture Brownie stood before a tombstone, 
her upturned face radiant with ecstasy in 
a direct right-angle beam from the sun. like 
Virgin Mary pierced by the Divine Af-
flatus. From the names (Brownie was 
photographed no less than twenty-five 
times before as many tombstones), I de-
cided the setting for all these pictures was 
a family burial ground now in disuse. The 
most recent death-date I noticed was 1918, 
perhaps a young victim of the First Great
