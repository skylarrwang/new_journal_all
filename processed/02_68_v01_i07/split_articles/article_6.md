who did not like what Morrison was say-
ing but he decided to postpone action. 
"Let's get some music, or let's stop this 
stuff," he decided, and he tried to talk to 
the drummer from behind the curtains. 
"Oh, no, I can't do a thing with him," 
Densmore replied, and continued to keep 
beat. 

The next song was the longest; it was 
also the last. For fifteen minutes, with-
in the framework of "Love Me Two 
Times," sometimes singing, more often 
talking, Morrison slowly recounted the 
shower-room incident when "the Man, 
you know him, dressed in a pretty little 
blue uniform with bright brass buttons, 
yeah, you know who I mean," sprayed 
him in the eyes with MACE. 
"I just have to tell you this," Morrison 
said. "To get it off my chest." Audience 
staring, silent. "Here I am with this girl, 
you know, just a friend of mine, and 
we're in this dressing room. Only it's 
actually a shower." Lt. Kelly began to 
consult with other police officers. Baker, 
the officer who found Morrison in the 
dressing room, watched Morrison care-
fully. Kelly disappeared backstage. 
Morrison continued his story, while the 
rest of The Doors kept playing softly. 
The song ended. Morrison consulted with 
Manzarek about the next number as the 
audience shouted out requests. 

Suddenly the house lights were turned 
on. Morrison squinted at the brightness 
and sat down on the drums, demanding 
that the lights be turned off. Lt. Kelly 
appeared from behind the curtains and 
announced that "the show's over, boys." 
As he approached the shouting singer and 
tapped him on the shoulder, Morrison 
stood, turned to him slowly, still shouting, 
and then handed him the microphone. 
Policemen rushed on stage, including 
Baker, who later explained, "People come 
to listen to music, not to that stuff. We 
couldn't let it continue." The police 
grabbed Morrison as flash bulbs exploded, 
and they dragged him behind the curtains. 
More police bustled the other three Doors 
offstage. 

The impact on the audience was im-
mediate. Some rushed screaming to the 
stage in an attempt to follow Morrison, 
others broke through the guarded exits 
backstage where they witnessed several 
police dragging him down the corridor. 
"For crying out loud, would you leave my 
hair alone!" Morrison shouted, trying to 
kick himself free. "I'm not going to fight." 
He was forced out the door, led through 
the dark, muddy parking lot, and placed 
in a police wagon which took him to the 
station a few blocks away. 

At the Arena, the police used MACE 
and force to subdue the angered crowd. 
Several people were arrested for resisting 
the police, including five or six minors 
and three reporters. Tim Page, a free-
lance photographer working for Life, tried 
to photograph some police "roughing up" 
a boy outside the Arena, but was stopped 
by what he later said was a slug from one 
policeman that sent him reeling into the 
street. As Page and Yvonne Chabrier, 
another Life reporter, tried to explain that 
they had press passes, Officer Charles 
LeGrand shouted, "I don't care who you 
are," and arrested them along with Village 
Voice jazz critic Michael Zwerin. After 
a thorough search, LeGrand placed them 
in a paddy wagon, which took them to 
the police station, where they were locked 
up in temporary cells. (On January 23, 
they pleaded not guilty on all three ac-
counts: breach of peace, resisting arrest, 
and interfering with an officer.) Outside 
the police station later on the night of the 
concert, an estimated 40 youths gathered 
to protest Morrison's arrest; he was 
released from his temporary cell early 
Sunday morning on $1500 bail. 

During the next few days, several 
rumors about the arrest were circulated 
by people who could not believe that the 
charges of indecent and immoral exhibi-
tion were authentic. Some suspected that 
drugs were found on the Doors' equipment 
backstage. "Well, I heard some talk about 
heroin being backstage," said Lt. Kelly 
the next Monday; "but I was unable to 
find out anything about it." Upon hearing 
other rumors, Kelly responded, "Look. 
Anybody can be a Monday-morning 
quarterback. But at the time, I thought that 
what I decided to do--to turn the lights 
on and stop the show-was the best deci-
sion." 

Trial was set for January 2, and then 
postponed until January 16, at which 
time Morrison didn't bother to show up, 
thus forfeiting $1500 bail. The reasons 
Morrison didn't appear were explained in 
advance by Ray Manzarek, the Doors' 
organist. "We don't especially want to 
show up in New Haven, if you know what 
I mean," Manzarek told an interviewer in 
Los Angeles in early January. "We wanted 
to sue, but there are more creative things 
we want to do with our time, like records 
and movies and TV shows." If Morrison 
does cross into Connecticut within the 
next year, he will be subject to re-arrest for 
the same charges. 

The entire drama of the concert in 
New Haven continues to remain something 
of a mystery to The Doors. "The charges 
are ridiculous," said Manzarek. "I will 
swear on the gospel that there was no 
obscenity-maybe some muffled sounds 
and some screams, which could be con-
strued to be obscene--but I know what 
Jim's obscenity is like, and he wasn't 
obscene. But you see, we're singing about 
the image of darkness. It's okay to sing 
about the light, airy, bright side, but you 
have to have an equal balance by the 
dark side. That's deep down, the darkness, 
the madness. All the changes that take 
place in people take place in the dark 
side. The audience was great, they were 
digging us. But the police ... " He shook 
his head and then laughed.
