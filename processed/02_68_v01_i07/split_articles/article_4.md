latest developments about our plane. But 
the sergeant from Pleiku sat in a kind of 
passive vacancy that being shepherded 
around in large groups eventually gives 
one. "1 never want to see this country 
again," he muttered. "All the boys feel 
the same. Any one of them can tell you to 
the second how much time they have left 
here." 

When I returned from another fruitless 
foray inside, the sergeant continued as 
if I hadn't been gone. "We've got to fight 
this war the way we want, or not at all. I 
think they should let us bomb with no 
restriction!>. Let's get this war over with 
or pull out." 

The corporal who had joined us for a 
breath of air agreed. "We got to get those 
Commies before they take over all of 
Asia," he declared in his western drawl. 
"And we got to do it ourselves. The 
Vietnamese are so dirty and lazy. They 
don't do anything for themselves. They 
don't care." 

At one in the morning there was still 
no plane. "I tell you not to worry, there'll 
be one tonight," the corporal kept insisting. 
"That cargo has to get to Saigon.'' 

Every half hour or so our hopes would 
rise. An unannounced Herky Bird would 
suddenly soar in through the blackness 
and settle down on the dark field. "That's 
not }Ours," the corporal would dismiss 
us each time. Once, when two of them 
came in together, we groped our way out 
on the airstrip to inquire for ourselves. 
One was on its way to Bangkok for sup-
plies, the other to the Philippines by way 
of Japan. It was easier to get out of the 
country that night than to Saigon. 

At 3 a.m. the major in charge of opera-
tions appeared. He was infuriated that 
one of his men. suposed to be on duty, 
was sleeping peacefully on a rear bench, 
an electric fan turned gently on his head. 
''I'll bust his rank tomorrow," the major 
fumed, as if the sleeping figure were 
responsible for the Herky Bird's nonap-
pearance. Then the major, composing him-
self, reassured us amiably about a plane. 
"I guarantee you one tonight," he said, 
and added meaningfully, "Our cargo must 
get out." 

By now it was beginning to register on 
us that our fate was inextricably tied up 
with the cargo. The corporal smiled know-
ingly in ans'Aer to the question. "It's the 
most valuable cargo we have," he said. 
"Which is?" 
"The K.IA's." 

It amused him that I didn't know what 
the KIA's were. "The Killed In Actions," 
he explained. "We got two of them that 
have to get out tonight. They have to make 
a special refrigerated plane that comes 
from CgJifornia to pick them up in Saigon 
and take them back to the States:路 

The corporal \\as enjoying the situa-
tion. "You're luck\路:路 he teased us. "There 
are only two of them tonight. If there were 
.more than five you wouldn't be allowed 
on the plane at all. A correspondent flying 
with thirty-six last month took a picture 
of them piled up in their rubber bags. The 
crew grabbed the film and there was a big 
fuss in Saigon. Now the orders are that no 
civilians can fly with more than five KIA's 
at a time. And no pictures." 

"I wouldn't want to fly with even two of 
them," said the sergeant from Pleiku. ''The 
smell will make you sick." 

Again the silence, except for the droning 
of mosquitoes, as the corporal went about 
his business in the shed. I couldn't help 
thinking about those KIA's whose fates 
were suddenly linked with ours. What bad 
they known of this land and its people, did 
they know what they had died for, had 
they been counting their days to go home? 
A few hours ago they were one of us, now 
the}> were inert matter stuffed into rubber 
bags. secrets to be kept out of sight. The 
smell! could endure, but the spirits--
where were they? Neatly packaged too, or 
roaming about like angry Asian ghosts, 
seeking vengeance for having died in a 
cause that only words can solve? I felt a 
sense of terror of flying with those spirits 
through the black night sky. 

"We had sixty marines wiped out last 
week.'' said the sergeant from Pleiku, 
whose job it was to fuel the aircraft. "They 
came in fresh one day and we watched 
them step on those planes to go up to the 
demilitarized zone. The next day most of 
them were flown back to us-KIA's. Boy, 
that really broke us up." 

At 4 a.m. there was still no Herky Bird. 
A Negro sergeant, replacing the corporal 
on duty. urged us not to give up hope. 
"The KIA's always get out.'' he said, offer. 
ing us a cigarette. "I'm getting out too," 
he added with a smile. "But I"m not going 
back to the States. I haven't been there in 
five years. I'm getting my discharge from 
this army and I'm going to find me a job 
in Thailand or the Philippines. But they'D 
never get me back to Vietnam or the 
States." 

At 5 a.m. it fell upon the sergeant to in路 
form us of what we knew was inevitable. 
"There definitely will not be a plane any-
more," he said. "They just phoned that 
the only one they had to send broke doWD 
on takeoff." 

Then he continued as if to comfort u.s, 
"You know these planes get so much use. 
Eventually their parts just wear out and 
there just aren't enough spares to replace 
them all the time." 

I lay down on one of the outside benches 
to catch a few moment's sleep before 
dawn. At least the KIA's wouldn't know 
the Herky Bird had failed them. As for 
the rest of us, we could cling to the dismal 
hope that the Herky Bird would surely 
appear in the hot, merciless sky, gatherinJ 
up its dead, replacing them with more 
fresh recruits, and then continuing on its 
regularly scheduled circuit over South 
Vietnam. 


**Faculty and Graduate Students**

Faculty and graduate students 
As most of you know, The New 
Journal goes to all members of the 
Yale community; however we are 
discovering that we go to some mem-
bers two and even three times. 

The problem is this: no master lists 
were available which provided exact 
addresses for everybody associated 
with Yale, so we had to construct our 
address lists from a variety of sources. 
Thus, the duplication. 

Will you help us to eliminate the 
duplication by using the coupon 
below to Jet us know 
a) if you are receiving more than 
one copy of The New Journal 
in your household 
b) if you are receiving a copy at 
home in addition to the one you 
receive through Yale Station.
