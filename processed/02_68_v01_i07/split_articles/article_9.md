I!8Ch man had his own personal sidearm he 
.,ned for mopping up. A Swedish K automatic 
piiiOI seemed to be the favorite. 

C.pt. George O'Grady wears a steel helmet 
~led after the old Roman battle helmets. His 
dOOr gunners were enlisted people and as savage 
• the drivers. I saw a door gunner who affected 
ciMrakln gloves and long gauntlets. One man I met 
llld been mustered out and had gone home t o 
clwlllan work. He couldn't stand it at home. He re-
enll8ted and went back for another tour. 

One night Harvey's Huey made a pass over the 
edge of a suspect village. "We emptied a full load of 
ammo out on the silent darkness and went back to 
Vlnh Long; no one will ever know if we hit anything 
but we did a lot of shooting." On another afternoon, 
when Harvey asked a chopper pilot how he did, the 
man answered in disgust: "Wash out. Got me two 
VC water buffalo and a pregnant woman." 

The reason Harvey finds the chopper c rews the 
"jolliest" is that at least they know whom they are 
killing. The worst crimes being committed against 
the people of South Vietnam, however, are being 
commited by one of the least criticized of all our 
weapons, the B-52 bombers, once the backbone of 
General Curtis LeMay's SAC, the key to Dulles's 
.. massive retaliation" policy. Designed to deliver the 
H-bomb to the Soviet Union, they have this role in 
Vietnam: 

1M B-52 crews are old pros. They took on the 
llllalon of defending the United States when they 
could, at any moment, have been ordered to fly 
deep Into Russia against deadly defense of missiles 
lnd fighters-a mission from which many of them 
IIDUid not have returned. Now they have a quite 
-.rent set of orders. To blast or burn large areas 
o1 Jungle (also, roads, buildings and fields) con-
llllnlng living things, animals and men, some in-
ROCent and unaware, without warning. It's not a 
lllleelon of their choosing. It's just the w ay the ball 
Mppened to bounce. But one can't help but wonder 
what • man thinks about, after he'd set fire to 50 
.... ,. miles of j ungle from high altitude with a rain 
oltlre bombs, and wakes up In his room In the 
darkness-and lies awake watching the shadows 
Oft lhe ceiling •••• 

Nothing will live in those fifty square miles. Even 
• turtle burrowed in the mud at the back of a cave 
'Will become only an ash. Used in this fashion the 
8-52 comes perilously close to a weapon of 
Olnocide. According to Harvey and other reporters. 
OUr B-52 operations, using 3,000-pound bombs 
( .. Instant swimming pool makers'' the pilots say) 
llllve done as much to create the 2,500,000 to 
~000 ref~ gees in South Vietnam as any other 
can actron. 

What do these men feel about what they are 
~ng? Their professionalism protects them, Harvey 
-ieves, as well as their ability to make abstract the 
,_,Ita of their work. Harvey tried to invite a group 
Of B-s2 pilots to visit a hospital at Can Tho where 
the OVerwhelming majority of patients were women 
8nd children with fire and bomb wounds, but they 
• 
111Du1dn•t go inside. They insisted, in fact, that they 
~ never hit anyone. When Harvey offered to 
...._~ quite a few they did hit, one of them 
~ 
aald: "Yeah, but we patch 'em up, don't 
_,.. h even made the pilots laugh. 

The protection, then, is not to see. One of the 
most pathetic American statements to come from 
the war was made by John McCain 3rd, son and 
grandson of full admirals, after surviving the 
Forrestal holocaust. "It's a difficult thing to say. 
But now that I've seen what the bombs and napalm 
did to the people on our ship, I'm not so sure I want 
to drop any more of that stuff on North Vietnam." 
But he was a professional and was shot down doing 
it several months later. 

Harvey's book probably will not open any flier's 
eyes but it can help to reopen the eyes of Americans 
who have become somewhat jaded with reports of 
search-and-destroy missions and the "pacification" 
of the village of Ben Sue. Although Harvey didn't 
intend it this way, Air War: VIetnam provides new 
factual ammunition for those who wish to shift the 
debate about the war from argument about American 
political and military strategy, an argument that has 
become repetitive and frozen, to the question 
whether American actions are morally defensible 
on any grounds whatever. 

There is a legacy of Western thought, rather 
innocent but still a potent political force, that there 
are some things that just cannot be done, some 
actions that cannot be taken in the name of military 
expediency. Notwithstanding the complexities of our 
involvements in Vietnam, this moral argument is a 
quite simple one. One does not pour flaming jellied 
gasoline on the heads of women and children 
merely because there may be an enemy in the house 
or at least in the house next to it. One does not drop 
anti-personnel fragmentation bombs on undefended 
villages in the hope of scaring out soldiers, when 
there is certainty of mutilating people. 

There is a moral logic here: if this is the kind of 
action the government chooses to take, then not only 
should one withhold support of that action but it 
becomes one's duty to resist efforts by the govern-
ment to make one help fight such a war-something 
a good many people, especially the young, have 
chosen to do. However, while this argument is ef-
fective in shoring up the courage of individuals, it 
seems to me one that could have a far mo re powerful 
political effect than it yet has had. Proponents of the 
President's policy should not be allowed to hide 
behind the question of our involvement in Vietnam, 
tor which a case can be made, but should be forced 
to defend our conduct there, which, on examination, 
becomes indefensible. For this purpose, facts are 
necessary; some of these facts are to be found in 
Harvey's book. More are needed. 

A second legacy that most of us share, though it 
lies dormant in us, is the belief that men somehow 
are still held accountable for their deeds. It is the 
thought, after all, which informed Nuremberg. 
Generals don't make policy (usually), but they 
formulate and approve military conduct. Sooner or 
later the military people who have authorized and 
condoned such tactics as "Recon by fire" should be 
made to account for these acts before the American 
people. It is inexcusable that men such as Westmore-
land have been able to appear on television pro-
grams and at news conferences and have not been 
forced to account for the kind of tactics and weapons 
being used on the people of both Vietnams. Simply 
asking the question, spelling out the terms, would 
have value. It should prove interesting to hear, 
especially in the face of a persistent q uestioner, 
the defense of cluster-bombing a row of houses in 
the hope of finding a suspect. Until now one of the 
reasons for the absence of such questions has been 
a lack of hard information about just exactly what 
it is we are doing. 

I don't mean to suggest that such information as 
is documented in the book is going to cause an 
immediate sense of moral outrage throughout the 
US. It will not. But if there is hope for this country, 
it must be that when information of the kind con-
tained in Air War: Vietnam 1S more thoroughly known 
and understood (although Harvey has made it plain 
this was not his purpose in writing this book), an 
increasing number of people will find unacceptable 
both our presence in Vietnam and the political 
candidates who support that presence.
