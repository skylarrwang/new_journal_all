To the Editors: 
As a longtime resident of Orange County 
I beg to be allowed to remark briefly on 
the article "The County That Made 
Ronald Reagan Possible" by Messrs. 
Mandelbaum and Weisman. First, I ques-
tion the authors' apparent belief that 
Orange County is peculiarly responsible 
for Governor Reagan's political promin-
ence. Certainly seven of ten county voters 
did vote for him in 1966, but so did a 
good many other Californians. After all, 
be did defeat the incumbent by nearly 
1,000,000 votes. Something more than a 
single county "made Ronald Reagan pos-
sible," and the implications of his political 
success are just beginning to unfold.

Second, I believe the authors were far 
from charitable in their devoting so little 
attention to the development of the Uni-
versity of California campus at Irvine 
with its proposed surrounding community. 
This is one of the most exciting planned 
community programs now being under-
taken in the country, and is potentially 
perhaps the most far-reaching. (1 com-
mend a short article in Saturday R~view, 
23 September 1967, by Myron Roberts, 
""lbe Making of a City," for details.) I 
would not be surprised if in the future the 
Irvine community has a much lonaer-
lasting and more penetrating effect on the 
life of Oranae County (and on the "Ameri-
can Dream" as well) than either Knott's 
Berry Farm's celebrations of the past or 
the Santa Ana Regisur's editorial policy.

My compliments to Mrs. Braudy. She has 
written an excellent piece on Joe Heller 
(The New Journal, November 26, 1967). 
There was a chap in the office with us 
who did not like Heller. And vice versa. 
One day Heller brought in a carbon of his 
manuscript, asked if his sidekick would 
care to read it. Sidekick did, said it was 
awful. "I think so, too," Heller told him, 
"guess I'll just chuck it." That, however, 
was several days after the book had been 
accepted by Simon and Schuster.

I don't know if the story is true. I got 
it second hand. But it sounds like Joe. 
Herbert R. Mayes 
(Mr. Mayes, now editor-at-large for the 
Saturday Review, was editor of McCalfs 
when Heller worked for that magazine.)


I thought your readers might be interested 
in the answers to our Modern Library 50th 
Anniversary Contest--Sweepstake that 
we ran with you in October. Some con-
fusion resulted from an error on our part 
under David Levine's sketch number 7 
(James Joyce). There were three blanks 
for the titles of his books but there should 
have been only two, for Ulysses and The 
Dubliners. Taking the others in order, the 
answers are: 
Â· 1. Kierkegaard 
2. Honore de Balzac 
3. Lord Byron 
4. Fyodor Dostoyevsky 
5. OscarWilde 
6. Nietzsche 
8. Edgar Allen Poe 
9. AlbertCamus 
10. Jean Jacques Rousseau 
11. Joseph Conrad 
12. D. H. Lawrence 
13. Sigmund Freud 
14. Jean Genet 
15. John Dewey 
16. Sir Richard Burton 
17. Anton Chekhov 
18. Dante Alighieri 
19. Bernard Shaw 
20. William Faulkner 
21. Mark Twain 
22. Pushkin

We received about 5,500 entries which 
I think is pretty impressive considering 
that the contestants had to name 22 
authors from David Levine's caricatures-
also write out the titles of 59 of their 
books.

The winner of the Classic Phaeton Car 
was Miss Lyn Levenberg of Greenwich 
Village. She is, coincidentally, a writer. 
She was last seen beading south with the 
top down.

The second prize was won by Waverly 
Barbe, who is a professor at the Tuscaloosa 
State Colege in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. And 
the third prize was won by Conrad 
Discont. who is a Junior College Instructor 
in Fresno, California. The second and 
third prizes were a complete set of Mod-
em Library books (373). There were 21 
other winners from all over the country 
and remarkably enough 25% of the 
winners were from California. Could this 
mean that the intellectual center of 
America has shifted along with the 
population?

I shall leave you with this rather tragic 
thought to ponder.
