FBI 
"Do you have your draft card on your 
person? How well do you know Reverend 
Coffin? ... Well, frankly son, it's kind 
of a personal thing, my feeling for the 
director, Mr. Hoover. Now did anyone 
help you decide to turn in your draft 
card? ... Of course we will have to report 
that you refused to answer some ques-
tions."

The pattern was the same that first day 
the FBI agents came swarming across 
campus after Resistance Week, in October. 
The two agents sit on hastily cleared 
chairs, trying to chase Grand Inquisitor 
fantasies from the interviewee's mind. One 
agent takes notes. One agent asks the 
questions and chats.

After several questions, they casually 
hand the interviewee a statement to sign. 
The statement waives the interviewee's 
right to silence and his right to counsel. 
He is tense, surprised, uncertain. Should 
he sign? What is penalty for not signing? 
Should he have started talking in the first 
place? What are his legal rights?

Thus six Yale people were taken totally 
off guard and answered some questions 
during surprise visits that Monday of the 
FBI's week-long Yale investigations.

According to a Yale Law Journal 
(December) article, all twenty-one Yale 
people ultimately interrogated were largely 
ignorant of legal rights to silence and to 
counsel guaranteed them by the Miranda 
and Escobedo decisions. They only learned 
of the rights after six were visited that first 
day.

If this highly inteiJigent and well-
educated group is ignorant of how the law 
protects them here, says author John 
Griffiths and Richard Ayres, then it is not 
surprising that less educated members of 
society are also ignorant of their rights.

After Monday's unexpected visits, the 
alleged resisters met with lawyers Griffiths, 
Charles Reich, and Clyde Sommers. They 
decided the best policy for future inter-
views would be silence. The lawyers ex-
plained that refusal to talk is not a cop out. 
Silence only guarantees that a potential 
court case would be less complicated-
cleaner,legally speaking. Silence would 
also make investigation proceedings a 
little harder for the agents.

But principally, as John Griffiths said 
recently, one doesn't really know what the 
agents are really after. If you answer 
questions, selectively or otherwise, you 
could unwittingly implicate someone else. 
You yourself might, both fortunately and 
unfortunately, be of little interest to the 
investigators. Chances are they are prob-
ably after someone else. They interview 
you to pther evidence about a movement 
and its.leaders. Any evidence you give 
might be used to implicate an alleae<f 
leader, like Rev. Coffin.

But what about the six Yale people who 
talked to aaents before the lawyers told 
them how the law protects them. Not one 
of the six attributed his decision to turn in 
his draft card to the influence of any other 
person.

The article points out that the FBI often 
made no attempt to refer or inform these 
people of their legal rights until several 
questions had been discussed. When the 
agents finally proffered the waiver state-
ment, people were simply confused. They 
had already talked to the agents about 
their lack of draft cards and why. They 
were not aware when they gave the in-
formation that they didn't have to 
answer at all.

After the meeting with the lawyers, the 
six agreed that they would not have spoken 
to or tried to "evangelize" the agents, had 
they known of their rights.

Said one, "They seemed so reasonable 
that I guess I tried to convince them of my 
position."

After Monday's meeting with the 
lawyers, fifteen more people were visited 
by agents of the FBI. T}ley kept silent 
on resistance questions.

Ironically, according to Griffiths and 
Ayres, many stiH insisted on keeping up 
the charade of politeness and tried to 
respond in terms of normal social inter-
action. The agents themselves tried not to 
disrupt the social situation, remained 
polite for the most part, and assumed an 
an engaging middle-class manner.

"For middle class suspects like ours," 
write Griffiths and Ayres, "it seems that 
one of the fundamental rules is that one 
not be unnecessarily rude. Even after 
Â·the Monday meeting, in which the nature 
of the interrogator's job-and in partic-
ular the fact that it is a job-was dis-
cussed, the subjects remained largely 
unable to treat their encounter as an early 
stage in a formal, adversary legal 
process. For instance, one said to the 
gents, 'I believe I have a legal right not 
to answer questions, if you don't 
mind .... '"
