**Title: Waiting for the Herky Bird**
**Author: Betty Jean Lifton**
**Page number(s): 3-4**

Betty Jean Lifton, a free lance writer, 
last summer made her first trip to Vietnam 
since serving there as a correspondent in 
1954 after the Geneva Accords. She also 
covered the end of the Korean War and 
has contributed to The New York Times 
Magazine, Mademoiselle, and the Asahi 
Evening News of Tokyo. She is the wife of 
Robert Jay Lifton, professor of psychiatry 
at Yale.

I made my first acquaintance with the 
Herky Bird when I flew from Saigon to 
Qui Nhon and Danang last summer. 
Officially designated as the Cl30 Hercules, 
the Bird is a camouflaged, slightly pot-
bellied four engined turboprop transport 
that regularly shuttles north from Saigon 
to the sprawling bases, the more modest 
supply depots, and the tiny isolated jungle 
camps. Known for its reliability, the GI's 
have come to regard the Herky Bird as 
one bit of certainty in an uncertain war.

I had dressed in what I felt was appro-
priate attire for going out into the field 
with the boys-old, baggy, khaki-colored 
slacks, a faded tailored shirt and flat 
sandals. I had studiously avoided makeup 
or even removing Saigon's surplus dust 
from my hair. And so I was astounded 
on climbing into the cockpit, to what is 
known as the Ladies' Bench, to find a 
young woman in a bright summer dress, 
high heels, and freshly-coiffured hair, with 
copies of Glamour and Good Housekeep-
ing on her lap. We might have been 
taking off for some tropical resort.

She was the secretary to the General at 
one of the camps. "I've been out here a 
year," she said, "and I've just extended for 
the next four months. I like it a lot. The 
social life is good, there's no danger if 
you stay close to camp, and the time goes 
quickly." Then she volunteered: "I'm hop-
ing to get a certain lieutenant colonel to 
propose by Christmas. It would mean 
divorcing his wife. If he doesn't, I'll go 
back to Kansas and get some kind of 
work there."

Knowing she was based in an area 
famous for its refugee settlements, I asked 
her about them. "Refugees?" she said 
"I haven't seen any refugees."

When I insi~ted that her province alone 
was reponed to have 76,000 unsettled 
refugees, she conceded, "Oh, there are 
some Vietnamese behind barbed wire en-
closures down the road from us. Maybe 
that's them. I'm really not interested in 
these people. They're so diny and they 
won't help you do anything. I can't even 
find anyone to clean my room who doesn't 
spit on the floor. And they're so unreliable. 
The boys don't like them either.'' And 
then she concluded with a shrug, "I know 
I shouldn't talk like this, but I can't help 
the way I feel. Even the General thinks 
I'm too hard on the Vietnamese."

The Herky Bird by now had taken off 
and was flying north along the shoreline 
of the South China Sea. The co-pilot 
motioned for me to come forward and 
look down. Below were some of the most 
breathtaking beaches in this part of the 
world. Again there was the uncomfortably 
relaxed feeling of being on a resort flight. 
However, the view to the west, where the 
plains along this narrow strip began to 
rise into steep mountains, brought me 
back to the reality of Vietnam. Bomb 
craters bearing testimony to an aerial 
bombardment of the day or week before 
stood out like open wounds on the earth.

I began to notice the scattered American 
installations, patches of tents and quonset 
huts, of barbed wire and airstrips, placed 
so inappropriately in this lush landscape.

As we dropped into Nha Trang at night-
fall, picking up troops, leaving off supplies, 
I could feel the isolation of those hot, dusty 
camps, surrounded by hostile territory, 
dependent on the Herky Bird for their 
supplies and connection with the outside 
world.

One night I found myself dependent on 
the Herky Bird. I was waiting for the 11 
p.m. Herky Bird to deliver me .from the 
Qui Nhon air terminal back to Saigon. I 
had visited the Danang and Qui Nhon pro-
vincial hospitals, most of whose patients 
were the civilian war-wounded. I bad seen 
children with amputated limbs, and young 
people with half their faces blown away, 
and old people with shattered hips and 
staring eyes; and I had heard stories about 
how they were sleeping in their beds, or 
tending their water buffalo or cooking in 
the kitchens when the shells or mortars un-
expectedly hit, catching them in crossfire 
or just falling like thunderbolts from some 
angry god. I was almost stupefied with the 
accumulated beat and stench and sorrow 
of those over-crowded wards, and now as 
I 1 p.m. approached, I could only hope 
that the Herky Bird would not be late.

But at 11 p.m. the Herky Bird did not 
appear. The GI's waiting with me talked 
casually of crashes--of the big one at 
Danang, the one at An Khe, of those 
caused by maintenance problems or short 
runways, and of the one that killed eight 
educators a few months before on a moun-
tain near Danang-"bad visibility."

"Don't worry, one Herky Bird or an-
other always comes through, even if not 
exactly on the nose," said the young 
corporal in charge of coordinating flights. 
"In aU my times here I've never known a 
night when the Herky Bird did not show 
up."

However, when the Herky Bird did not 
appear at midnight, the corporal, who had 
been communicating with Saigon by 
phone, admitted that the scheduled flight 
had broken down. "But another plane will 
be leaving there shortly," be promised. "If 
it makes the usual stop at Nba T rang, it 
will get here in an hour and a half. But 
if it continues on to Danang and Hue, 
as the other should have done, you might 
have to wait up to four hours." And then 
he added cheerily, "Still, they just might 
send a special plane from a nearby base, 
for we have important cargo that must 
get to Saigon tonight." Since Qui Nhon 
was a supply depot, neither I nor the other 
correspondent stranded there thought 
to ask what the cargo was.


There was little air in the small, brightly-
lit terminal, but some of the soldiers 
stretched out on the hard benches, their 
rifles resting like faithful dogs next to their 
helmets on the floor. Their faces looked 
young, and unlived-in as they slept. We sat 
outside on the benches where there was a 
slight breeze coming in off the sea, but also 
mosquitoes. Next to us was a sergeant 
waiting for a morning flight to take him 
back to Pleiku in the Central Highlands. 
"I would have driven back to Pleiku 
in the convoy earlier this evening, but 
Mama-san didn't have my laundry ready," 
he said-the ·•san" being GI lingo carried 
over from the Japanese Occupation and 
the Korean War ... The road has two bad 
passes where "'e usually get shot up a bit, 
but it might have been worth it to avoid 
waiting here all night."
