34-year-old untenured teacher of 
English, unable to finish his 
dissertation, delivers that he can from his 
window look out on the graduate 
students, and more particularly on two 
of them, Cynthia Potter and Diana Lou Moon, 
spending the fall semester undressing 
themselves. Hartspring now finds that he 
is more involved with voyeurism with 
significantly more intensity than his struggles to come 
to grips with his debts, his complaining but 
loving wife, his three children, and that 
damned dissertation. 

He tangles with fearsome 
characters like Yoke, who is fashioning 
a bizarre cult of tape recordings; Hardin, the 
head of the campus police who's on a 
witch hunt campaign against communists and 
perverts, and a small assortment of other 
oddball types. 

Hartspring is the hero of a new novel, 
Blows His Mind, by Ernest Lockridge, 
assistant professor of English at 
. This is the first novel by Lockridge, 
the son of the author of 
County. 

What follows is Chapter 9. In 
the preceding chapter, Hartspring has just-
after the malicious offices of Yoke-met 
Cynthia Potter:

"I hope to see you again soon, Miss Potter!"
"Don't worry, honey!" she shouted back. 
"I will."

And I did. With a new fury and a new 
wrinkle, Blondie exposed herself to me. 
The new wrinkle was Yoke. For while I sat 
in my office and watched impotently out 
the window, while the new and fearsome 
pain in my rectum appeared to grow 
stronger and stronger, Yoke had scaled 
the nunnery wall to Blondie's room, and 
on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays (the 
only part of the week men were allowed 
to invade the crystal palace) in an awesome 
display of sexual athletics, the pair of them 
broadcast Yoke's incubistic self-imposi-
tion upon the world and Blondie's hatred 
of men. I mean that seriously about 
Blondie: never in my life-not even dur-
ing my forays into Yokohama dives during 
the Police Action to watch what must 
have been Lesbians-have I seen a woman 
display such apocalyptic contempt for the 
act of love. By her lewdness, she meta-
morphosed life into death. And as the life-
giving seed grew steadily in my own dear 
Mona's womb, I felt what I feared was 
cancer filling my rectum with destruction. 

All along, now, I've been boring hell 
out of you whining and complaining about 
how miserable my life has been. But look-
ing back, I think maybe this was the worst 
time of all. Poor Hartspring. Dear reader, 
shed a tear. Winter had settled in good, 
and it was a raw, miserable winter. Snow 
plopped from the grim sky, and demonic 
winds blew it onto every eave, every cor-
ner, every windowcrack. When I trembled 
out into the grisly mornings and futilely 
attempted to start our ageing Henry J, 
I was forced to freeze my balls on a thin 
blanket of snow which the wind had 
blasted through the windows, settling it 
over the carseat like radioactive dust. 

When God grew weary of snow, He 
brightened His life with freezing rain. 
The icy glue stuck lids to their garbage 
cans. Stray dogs huddled in doorways of 
buildings wheezing out green clouds of 
breath. Even pigeons grew scarce, as if 
they had awakened one morning under 
the eaves and found their feet frozen to 
the guttering, their beaks paralyzed in mid-
coo, the whole gigantic network of their 
bowels constipated like the coils of a 
Frigidaire. 

And I, brooding above the mystery of 
my own bowels, stared from my office 
window across the frozen void at the 
winsome antics of Cynthia Potter with 
her Yoke-stared as Danton must have 
stared in grisly fascination at Madame 
Guillotine looming now for him-and 
thought furiously about death. 

There they stood one winter evening 
in mid-December, before Cynthia Potter's 
lighted window (Blondie's curtains had 
been drawn now for several days), each 
with a freshly mixed cocktail in hand, 
laughing, chatting gaily with Yuletide 
Spirit, both nude-Blondie bent like a 
mare, her hair wound in Yoke's free right 
hand, while Yoke like a stallion skillfully 
and interminably demonstrated the 
mechanics of erotic position number five. 
And I, too, though more abstractly, con-
sidered the mechanics of screwing. What 
-God forbid!-if it were cancer growing 
slowly in my rectum, a deadly little chunk 
of anarchic gristle? I remember when I 
was very young an aunt on my mother's 
side who for six months complained of 
shooting pains in her bowels and constipa-
tion before finally submitting to the atten-
tion of a doctor-of all people, my father. 
Who promptly plunked her in the hospital 
for exploratory surgery. One evening 
perhaps a week after my poor aunt died 
and we were finishing a dinner of steak 
and lima beans, Pop asked suddenly if 
Mother or I had any idea what cancer 
looked like. I guess Pops was a diabolical 
cuss and, as I later gleaned from my 
mother's drunken ramblings, a satyro-
maniac like me before he took to soothing 
his nerves with morphine. "For heaven's 
sake, Seymore. Is that anything to ask 
during dinner?"

"Son, look into that bowl."

I did. Inside were a few leftover limas 
getting dry and crusty.

"When I cut Aunty open," Doctor 
Hartspring said, "her guts were chock full 
of little pieces of gristle that looked just 
like those lima beans."

"Oh, Seymore, how can you?" Mother 
rushed from the table crying, and dear old 
Dad shouted after her:

"Well goddamn it, you've got other 
sisters I like one hell of a lot better! Clean 
your plate, son."

Sitting there watching Yoke and Cynthia 
in conversation, I imagined a whole bean-
patch growing down there in me-and 
what it would be like if I finally went to a 
doctor, and he cut it out but was forced 
to close up my rectum and shoot a piece 
of gut out my abdomen near my prick so I 
could now and then take a crap! What 
would I do? "Doc, while you're at it, just 
cut off my prick." What woman could 
stand me now? Even my missing teeth 
would no longer be an enticement. Could 
my dear Mona bear taking her solace with 
a man whose intestine protruded from his 
belly and was fastened together with a 
little plasticene clamp? How would I go 
about breaking wind? I could see myself 
on a bus or subway with the chunk of in-
testine swelling up under my belt like a 
helium balloon. Nightmares! And finally 
exploding and all the windows suddenly 
looking like your windshield when a semi-
trailer passes you on a slushy turnpike. 

After such an operation, I'd be forced to 
buy my Yokohama manual and learn all 
I could about Yoke's fancy-dan tactics. No 
more rubbing together of warm bellies. 
No more those firm breasts, those taut 
nipples swelling against my chest! Those 
maddening hot looks into each other's eyes. 
And no more those soft arms pinioning 
my neck, those deep kisses during the act 
of love. I'd have to transform myself into 
a goddamn plumber, a pipefitter. No! 
Better death! I resolved to keep the whole 
thing under my tail, so to speak-keep 
my suspicions from Mona and, most im-
portant, from all knife-wielding physicians, 
and, alas, live alone with my terror. 

During the last week before my univer-
sity began its Christmas holiday, I heard 
noises on the roof of my building right 
above my office-little scufflings and 
scrapings. Once while Yoke and Blondie 
were being particularly vigorous, I heard 
above me what seemed to be the muted 
whimper of a rabbit caught in the fangs of 
a hunter's trap. Even when the wind 
howled and sleet battered my glass, the 
noises persisted. 

Finally the evening just before vacation, 
I once again called Holmann away from 
his typewriter; we donned our coats, and 
together we made our way gingerly up the 
frozen fire escape outside Holmann's office 
window to the roof. 

At the rear of Blondie's brightly lit 
cubbyhole, Yoke had Cynthia Potter 
smack against the wall in what, for him, 
was an orthodox position, and Cynthia 
herself was looking over his shoulder at 
the window, an extremely bored expression 
under her teased blonde hair. 

On the roof near a tall brick chimney, 
a shabbily dressed young man stuffed a 
handkerchief into his coat pocket, lifted his 
face to the sky, and pretended not to 
notice that Holmann and I had just caught 
him with his pants down. Snow was falling, 
and its glare spotlighted the young man 
eerily. He wore a stocking cap. Though 
his coat was bulky and quilted, it appeared 
obvious that he was a fat boy. Unsnapped 
boots flapped away from his lower legs, 
and as Holmann and I approached him he 
stuck one hand into his coat to fasten 
his fly.

"Santa Claus is early," I said. "I heard 
the patter and pawing of his hoofs. Ho ho 
ho. What are you doing up here?"

"Wise guy or something?" the boy shot 
back. He was perhaps nineteen. Acne 
pitted his face. "What the hell business 
is it of yours?"

Holmann stayed behind. He had just 
seen Blondie and Yoke for the first time, 
and I thought he was going to tumble off 
the roof.

"Are you a student?" I asked.

"I was," he replied sullenly.

"Do you usually climb up on top of 
roofs during a snowstorm?"

"Look, what is this? The Gestapo? 
Can't a guy catch a little air if he wants 
to?"

Yoke must have finished. Blondie, nude, 
sauntered over to her window and closed 
the drapes.

"Now you listen to me," I said. "We're 
having trouble with voyeurists around 
here. Do you know what that means? 
Peepers, peeping toms."

"What in heaven's name are you imply-
ing?" asked the boy with forced dignity.

"I'm not implying anything. I just want 
to give you fair warning. The police know 
what's going on and they're on the lookout. 
I don't know what you were doing up here 
and I don't care. All I know is that to 
some people it might look suspicious. And 
I think that if you want to keep out of 
jail you'd better just march down that fire 
escape and run home the quickest route 
you know. Go on. Scram."

I could see the boy was about ready to 
cry. Still he didn't move. He looked into 
my face a moment, then began in a half-
sob, "What's the matter with people any-
way? How have I ever hurt them that they 
should do these things to me? Look at me, 
Mister. I'm ugly. I've never had a woman 
in my whole life. I've never even kissed 
one, and I probably never will as long as 
I live. But I go into the drugstore and 
what's the first thing I see? A whole rackful 
of magazines full of girls who aren't wear-
ing anything. Hundreds and thousands of 
naked girls, beautiful girls who are willing 
to take their clothes off just to be photo-
graphed, and there's not even one of them 
for me. Not one. You know what I've 
heard? There are even beautiful girls who 
take off their clothes and do it with a man 
so somebody can make a movie of it. I've 
got a good-looking pal who says there 
isn't a girl in the world won't go down with 
somebody. And then just a week ago, I'm 
walking along and I look up, and there's 
two people doing it in the window before 
they move back into the room. What am 
I supposed to do? Keep walking?"

"You're breaking my heart," I said.

"I'm leaving," the boy said. "It makes 
me want to kill myself. I really mean it."

He waddled to the fire escape and soon 
disappeared beneath the level of the roof.

Holmann had not moved. He stood 
transfixed looking at the glow from 
Blondie's closed drapes. Finally he gasped,
"I won't be able to sleep for a month."
