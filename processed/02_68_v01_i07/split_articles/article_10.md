The reprinting of the following article from The New 
York Review of Books for January 4, 1968, is 
sponsored by the seventeen members of the Yale 
faculty and staff whose names appear below. We 
are all supporters of the Rev. William Coffin in his 
conscientious resistance to the draft, and many of 
us have shared in his actions to this end. We found 
this an exceptionally revealing article on a subject 
that concerns all Americans. We urge everyone to 
read it, and consider its implications.

In the spring of 1966 a freelance writer named Frank 
Harvey was invited by Maj. George Weiss, PIO 
officer for the 7th Air Force in Saigon, to Vietnam to 
do a " definitive" study of the conduct of the air 
war. Harvey was reluctant to go; he is fifty-three 
and the assignment would be arduous and hazard-
ous. But because of his record as a military 
specialist (Harvey has written some eighty articles 
on military subjects in the past eighteen years, all 
of them laudatory, some of them adulatory), Weiss 
argued that Harvey was " obligated" to go. 

At the same time, Edward Muhlfeld, publisher of 
Flying, a well-edited, hawkish aviation magazine, 
also felt the time was right for such a study, and 
asked the Air Force officials in the Pentagon to 
suggest a writer for the job. The Pentagon named 
Frank Harvey. In spite of Harvey's reluctance, a 
liaison was arranged between Flying and Harvey, 
with the Pentagon acting as matchmaker. The ar-
rangement was consummated in June of that year 
when Harvey, at Flying's expense, flew to Saigon. 

In all Harvey spent fifty-five days in Vietnam. 

Because of his credentials, he was allowed and 
encouraged to fly every kind of mission being flown 
in Vietnam. When he returned to this country, he had 
sampled everything except a bombing run over 
North Vietnam and a B-52 raid over South Vietnam. 
His article, fifty-eight pages long, appeared in the 
November issue of Flying. In December a publisher 
asked Harvey to expand it to book length (he put 
back material Flying had cut, emphasized material 
the Pentagon had suggested be de-emphasized) and 
in July Air War: Vietnam was published in a silence 
which has persisted. This is unfortunate, since the 
book is the most complete record so far of what our 
airmen are actually doing to the people of Vietnam; 
it is extremely revealing, if at times reluctantly so, 
precisely because of those qualities that made 
Harvey so acceptable to the Air Force in the first 
place. 

At the outset Harvey intended to do no more 
than record, as clearly as possible, every aspect of 
the air w~r that he had experienced. From the carrier 
Constellation in the South China Sea he wrote 
Muhlfeld: "I am leaving the political situation strictly 
alone. My assignment is to tell about the air war-
not the reasons for it. And I certainly won't leave 
until we have spent some time in combat. To leave 
before that would be to miss the very heart of the 
excitement." 

The very heart of the excitement! It is Interesting 
to compare this with the celebrated opening para-
graph of Mary McCarthy's Vietnam. "I confess that 
when I went to Vietnam I was looking for material 
damaging to the American interest and that I found 
it, though often by accident or in the process of 
being briefed by an official." In Harvey's case he 
decidedly was not looking for damaging material, 
but, as Miss McCarthy did, he found it, and often in 
the same way. It is to his credit as a reporter that 
he put it down, often, it seems, against his will. In a 
curiously effective way his unwillingness to face 
the moral implications of what he saw makes 
Harvey's book at times more shocking even than 
Mary McCarthy's book. It also makes one wish Miss 
McCarthy had been able to see a fragment of what 
Harvey was encouraged to see. 

It did not occur to him then that if one is simply 
recording facts one can also be making a statement, 
and he was stunned when peace groups and pub-
lications began quoting chunks of prose from his 
article. He was called down to the Pentagon to 
account for some of the things he had written, and, 
although he knew that he had reported the truth, 
he was stricken with feelings of remorse for having 
let his country down. 

The tone of the book is set on the second page: 
Dixie Station had a reason. It was simple. A pilot 
going into combat for the first time is a bit like a 
swimmer about to dive into an icy lake. He likes to 
get his big toe wet and then wade around a little 
before leaping off the high board Into the numbing 
depths. So It was fortunate that young pilots could 
get their first taste of combat under the direction 
of a forward air controller over a flat country in 
bright sunshine where nobody was shooting back 
with high-powered ack-ack. He learns how it f-1• 
to drop bombs on hum~~n beings and watch huts 
go up In a boil of orange flame when his aluminum 
napalm tanks tumble into them. He gets hardened 
to pressing the button and cutting people down like 
little cloth dummies. as they sprint frantically under 
him. He gets his sword bloodied for the rougher 
things to come. 

This passage, in Harvey's notes, was originally 
written as a straight description of the young pilot's 
" blooding" process. He showed me these notes 
when 1 interviewed him before writing this review. 
The ironic "So it was fortunate" was added later. 
The paragraph was originally intended to shock, but 
not in the way it finally does. It was meant to alert the 
reader to the fact that this was a professional war 
and that, in a war, the pros learn how to press the 
firing button. But it is the image of helpless people 
sprinting frantically beneath the pilot that finally 
impresses us. 

Sartre has written that the ultimate evil is the 
ability to make abstract that which is concrete. The 
military have developed this into a habitual ap-
proach. Harvey's sin against the military code is 
not only his stubborn inability to make inhuman 
that which is human, not just to see targets as people 
and people as victims, but to feel for them as well. 
" There was nothing profound about it," Harvey told 
me. " I just peeked under one blanket too many and 
saw one too many broken bodies under it. Nothing 
we were doing was worth this." 

While Air War: Vietnam is revealing in this fashion, 
its greater interest lies in its hard factual informa-
tion. I felt, for example, that I was more than 
moderately well informed about the actions being 
taken in Vietnam in our name. I confess I was shaken 
by how little I knew about the air war, which plays 
an increasingly major role in the military effort there. 

Harvey begins his book with his trip to Saigon, 
and a visit to the Mekong Delta for a defoliation 
bombing run that was a part of "Operation Ranch 
Hand." The motto of defoliating crews was: Only you 
can prevent forests. At this point, Harvey's book 
seems to be describing brave men doing a nasty 
but needed job. But the tone soon begins to change: 
what begins to disturb Harvey, violating an inbred 
American sense of fair play, is the terrible one-
sidedness of things. If a peasant whose livelihood 
is being poisoned has the temerity to get a rifle and 
take a shot at the defoliation plane, the conse-
quences of his rash act will prove to be catastrophic. 
The accepted procedure at this moment is for a 
crew member to throw out a smoke grenade in the 
direction from which tie thinks the shot came; 
within minutes and sometimes seconds an aircraft 
the size of a Martin B-57 Canberra bomber, "riding 
shotgun" in the region, will explode onto the scene 
and saturate the area around the smoke with a fire 
power no American soldier has ever experienced. 
It struck Harvey as an excessive application of force. 
He had not yet reached the point of asking about the 
innocent people in the area who might be taking the 
full brunt of it. 

"Well, it is a little exaggerated," a flier told him. 
"We're applying an $18,000,00 solution to a $2 
problem. But, still, one of the little mothers was 
firing at us." 

Here the peculiar psychology of the American 
military emerges as something that seems unique 
,
in modern warfare. The American soldier has be-
come accustomed to such an overwhelming pre-
ponderance of fire power to back him up, especiallY 1 
air power (Harvey estimates it at about 1000 to 1 ), 
that he has come to think of it as his right, as an 
inherent property of being American, as the natural 
balance of life itself. If the enemy attempts to red rest 
the balance the reaction is often one of shocked 
surprise: "Why the little sons-of-bitches!" and some-
times absurdly violent. Negroes in the South have 
an understanding of this kind of reaction. Flying 
chose two adjectives to describe the nature of the 
air war: vicious and savage. Both are accurate. 

The justification for this behavior, which HarveY 
himself finds it hard to dispute, lies in the words 
" saving American lives." Any action can be con-
doned, any excess tolerated, any injustice justified. 
if it can be made to fit this formula. The excessive 
valuation placed on American life, over any other 
life, accounts for the weapons and tactics we feel 
entitled to use on the people of South Vietnam and, 
increasingly now, North Vietnam. 

The key to the air war in South Vietnam is the 
Forward Air Controllers. The FACs are, as HarveY 
terms them, "the death-bringers." They hover over 
the roads and river banks and paddies of the south 
in little Cessna 0-1 E Bird Dog spotter planes and 
act as all-seeing eyes looking tor signs of suspiciOUS
