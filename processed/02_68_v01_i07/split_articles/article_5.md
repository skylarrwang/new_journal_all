rtllllm.''

• •• • 1ol thought, let's get some music, or 
llt11top this stuff." 
Lieutenant 1 ames Kelly 
During the intermission of one of The 
Doors' first concerts in the San Francisco 
area, in the fall of 1966,lead singer Jim 
Morrison met a pretty girl with long dark 
hair and a very white face. 

They began to talk, and Morrison sug-
gested they find a quiet place away from 
the stifling crowd of The Matrix. The two 
discovered a vacant apartment house down 
the street where they could be alone until 
the next set of songs. The girl sat quietly 
and watched Morrison as he paced across 
the barren floor. He stood at the window 
looking out at the dark street, without 
saying a word. Then he turned to her 
quickly and startled her with the tone of 
his voice. "We're going to take over." 

He looked at her almost fiercely. "We're 
going to take over!" She believed him. 

Whether The Doors will "take over" 
is open to debate; whether New Haven 
will be the spearhead for the movement 
is quite another question, and the answer 
to that is almost surely a flat no. Such, at 
least, would be the opinion of the New 
Haven Police Department. On December 
9, 1967, officers ·of that force, after less 
than an hour of a Doors' concert in the 
New Haven Arena, suddenly hauled 
Morrison from the stage, setting off in the 
process a spontaneous eruption of protest 
from the 2000 people in the auditorium, 
and subsequently charged him with in-
decent and immoral exhibition, breach of 
peace, and resisting arrest. 

The New Haven Arena, often used as a 
skating rink, is a large, ugly building not 
far from the Yale campus. For a benefit 
concert in the Arena on Saturday, 
December 9, the New Haven College 
Interfraternity Council topped off a bill of 
local rock-and-roll groups with The Doors, 
an import from Southern California that 
takes its name from The Doors of Percep-
tion, Aldous Huxley's book about the 
drug experience. The Doors have pro-
duced two million-dollar-selling albums 
in their two-and-a-half year career; and 
their single, "Light My Fire," was the 
top-selling song in 1967 in many areas 
of the nation, including New Haven. The 
Doors describe themselves as "erotic 
politicians." And, says lead singer and 
songwriter Jim Morrison, who became 
thoroughly grounded in Antonio 
Artaud's Theater of Cruelty while a stu-
dent at UCLA: "We are in transition now. 
But just wait. We will soon be in theater, 
real drama. With dancers, singers, and a 
story plot. That'll be real drama." 

Their concert at the New Haven Arena 
turned out to be a drama in its own right, 
but instead of dancers, there were cops, 
and the story plot was not exactly the one 
Morrison would have written. The first 
incident occurred while the Doors were 
still backstage, as the crowd outside, 
mostly junior and senior high school 
students, was impatiently listening to the 
two hours of local talent. 

Officer Arthur Baker, one of fifteen 
patrolmen stationed inside the building, 
received a complaint from one of the on-
stage groups that a strange man was in 
the shower area of their dressing room 
with a girl. According to Baker, when be 
went to investigate he found the man and 
the girl "embracing and so forth." Not 
knowing that the mao was Jim Morrison, 
Baker ordered him to leave the area. When 
Morrison resisted ("he used four-letter 
words"), Baker reached into his pocket, 
took out a can of MACE, a stinging gas 
recently developed for convenient riot 
control, and squirted Morrison in the face.

Officer Baker was joined by Lt. James 
Kelly, the man in charge of the police 
detail at the Arena. They were leading 
the infuriated singer down the hall when 
the Doors' booking agent, along with 
organist Ray Manzarek, heard Morrison 
yelling and went into the hall to see what 
the trouble was. When they saw the police-
men leading Morrison away, the two 
pleaded with the police to stop the arrest. 
Manzarek explained to Baker and Kelly 
that the man in their custody was Jim 
Morrison, and if they arrested him there 
was a possibility that the waiting crowd 
would riot. Morrison was allowed to go 
into the Doors' dressing room while the 
booking agent explained to Lt. Kelly that 
"the man is under an emotional strain. 
He can either be classified as a genius, 
or else as a mental patient. He's in a world 
of his own." 

Kelly later recounted what happened 
next: "1 went into their dressing room. 
Mr. Morrison was sitting down, strumming 
his guitar. He immediately offered me his 
hand, and I accepted it. He apologized. 
He was like a little boy who had stole 
some candy, very different from before. 
He was under an emotional strain, he said, 
and asked me to let the incident go by. 
He seemed sincere. Since we were there 
to see no one gets hurt, I decided to forget 
the whole thing." 

A local radio DJ came on stage and 
seized one of the microphones. "And 
now, here they are ... the group you've 
all been waiting for ... I am proud to 
present ... The Doors!" A burst of ap-
plause, girls shrieked. No one appeared. 
The DJ glanced at his watch while the 
audience lapsed into silence. He consulted 
with someone behind the curtain, again 
approached the mike and requested that 
the lights be turned down. 

"And now, here they are ... the group 
you've.all been waiting for ... I am proud 
to present ... The Doors!" he repeated 
with equal gusto. Applause again as 
Manzarek entered and walked slowly to 
the organ-bass. Following him were 
guitarist Krieger and drummer Densmore. 
Krieger tuned his electric guitar for a few 
minutes. When he finished the audience 
fell silent, waiting. 

The curtains parted a foot or two. The 
2000 people whispered as two eyes peered 
out from the curtains, then cheered as a 
thin figured dressed in skin-tight black 
leather walked very slowly out and stopped 
behind the drummer. Morrison was smil-
ing like a child. After a minute he walked 
to the microphone near the edge of the 
stage. 

He threw something into the crowd, 
then he just stood there staring at the thin 
spotlight trained on him. He stuck his 
finger into his mouth, and drew it out 
slowly, still smiling. He leaned back 
from the mike and closed his eyes. 

Suddenly Morrison lunged forward 
and screamed the opening words of 
"Break on Through" and the instruments 
joined him loudly. "You know the day 
destroys the night, night divides the day: 
try to run, try to hide, Break on through 
to the other side, break on through to the 
other side!" Morrison strained to heave 
out the chorus, reeled back and forth, 
then sprang to the edge of the stage, 
tottered, spun like a ballet dancer, and 
stopped abruptly to hypnotize the audience 
with a long stare. He reminded one of a 
caged cat: his shoulder-length hair, his 
mane. And the music was just right, a 
smooth mixture of blues, hot acid, and 
something undefinable. Smooth, but not 
sterile: like Morrison, it spun, pounded, 
twisted into itself, then screamed to a 
sudden silence. 

One cop, looking, staring at Morrison, 
commented to a Life reporter, "He's sort 
of strange, isn't he? I don't like the way he 
dresses. Whatever happened to the clean-
cut guys, like Tony Bennett or Elvis 
Presley?" 

"Break on Through" ended and the 
longer, more intricate "When the Music's 
Over" took its place. Sanity had now 
left, and The Doors had taken its place. 
When the music's over, 
Turn out the lights. 
Well, music is your special friend 
Dance on fire as it intends 
Music is your only friend 
Until the end 
Until the end! 

And now Morrison began to improvise, 
as 2000 pairs of. eyes fixed on him: . 
''I'm playing a game, inside my brain, 
and the name of the game is going insane." 
The audience held its breath. "Five in 
one, one out of five, no one here gets out 
alive ... The old get older, but the young 
get stronger, well it might take a week and 
it might take longer." The dozen police-
men standing below either side of the 
stage shifted nervously and fixed their 
eyes on the audience. One fingered his belt 
"They've got the guns, but we've got the 
numbers. They've got the guns but we've 
got the numbers!" Morrison crouched, 
staring at a policeman. "We want the world 
and we want it .... now ....... now? 
............ NOW! !"he screamed and 
the organ, bass, guitar, and drums joined 
in an orgasmic crescendo. The rest of the 
song was played out and the police began 
to relax. Then, without warning, Morrison 
threw the microphone stand off the plat-
form. It clanged to the floor near some 
photographers crouched at the base of the 
stage. The police quickly cleared them 
away. 

Then ·~Alabama Song," written by Kurt 
Weill, which The Doors have darkened 
to their own image . 
. . . If we don't find the next little girl 
I tell you we must die 
I tell you 
I tell you we must die! 

And before the audience could forget 
the impact of the words, "Alabama Song" 
had flowed into "Back Door Man." "I am: 
sang Morrison, "the back door man. The 
men don't know, but the little girls under· 
stand." With the mike in his hand, be 
again conversed with the audience. 

His remarks were rather sexual. " Open 
up, baby, spread 'em wide, come on baby, 
I'm coming inside." He rubbed the mike 
cord through his crotch, back and forth, 
back and forth to the music. 

The police were motionless. Morrison 
crouched and hid his face. "Nobody loves 
me. Nobody loves me ... But I loves ya. 
That's my thing, I loves ya, so why don't 
you come on up here and let me do my 
thing? It's just you and me, baby, nobodY 
else counts." 

A young girl came forward to the edge 
of the stage. "/ love you,'' she said. The 
police hesitated, then five of them rushed 
forward and persuaded the girl to return 
to her seat. Some of the audience glanced 
at the police nervously, but the police did 
not attempt to stop the concert. Morrison 
pointed at one policeman, laughing. "He 
loves me. Yeah." 

Meanwhile, backstage, Lt. Kelly was 
receiving complaints from some parents
