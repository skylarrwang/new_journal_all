not feel a responsibility to train its 
workers. 

This attitude 
astonishes 
Altieri. "It is remarkable that an 
institution like Yale U n iversity which 
is here to educate people doesn't think 
it has the responsibility to tra in and 
educate its workers to try and better 
themselves," he said. In the recent 
contract talks, the u n ion asked for 50 
more workers, and, according to 
Altieri, it didn't mind if they were all 
trades helpers. Local35 even offered to 
give up its right to dispute University 
subcontracting in exchange for these 
jobs. While promising to maintain the 
current number of P hysical Plant 
union employs:f!s, the new contract 
includes no provisions for hiring 
additional union workers. The con-
tract also allows the University greater 
flexibility in the use of subcontractors. 

For their part, the union gained a six 
percent wage increase for all workers. 

Even with the wage increase, trades-
people in Physical Plan t receive about 
three dollars less per hour than the 
average New H aven skilled worker. 

Yet outside comparisons also show that 
working in a university setting differs 
markedly from working elsewhere. 
Yale workers rarely face layoffs, their 
work stays consistent, 
and 
the 
University provides extensive 
monetary as well as personal benefits. 

Wearing a brown shirt with a large 
blue and white Yale tag and toying 
with the job tickets in his pocket, 
Collins said, "Although I don't always 
like the people I have to work for, you 
do meet a lot of nice people. You meet 
a lot of important people too." 

But the constant battle between the 
union and the University every three 
years over similar issues does not speak 
well for worker-admin istration relaÂ· 
tions. According to Perrow, "There is a 
legacy of labor activism 
in 
New 
H aven. But this is not fostered by 
Yale. Yale is an elite institution and it 
is an ti-union." The University has had 
five strikes to date, and many Physical 
Plant workers feel that tney may never 
resolve certain issu es. 

M eanwhile, the bu ildings get older 
and the complaints mount. Allan 


Tulchin, 
a 
Yale College Council 
representative, has been collecting 
complaints in the mail for the Physical 
Operations Advisory Committee. 
Broken windows, leaky faucets, water 
damage, and falling plaster are all 
common problems. As Dulac ex-
plained, "Since I've been here the 
buildings have gotten 30 years older 
and we have fewer people to take care 
of them." Yale has been planning a 
long-overdue renovation project. If 
Yale gains the needed $350 million, 
this project will renovate the whole 
campus, excluding . the Medical 
School, over the course of five years. 
The 
University Capital Planning 
Committee, chaired by Provost 
William Nordhaus, will also oversee a 
separate $90 million residential college 
project. Yale will subcontract out most 
of the work, but Physical Plant will 
eventually benefit. With renovated 
buildings, the demand for daily repa,irs 
will decrease and Physical Plant may 
be able not only to respond to 
emergency calls faster, but to have 
time for preventive maintenance projects 
projects. 

In ilie long run, improved service 
might chip away at one of Physical 
Plant's most damaging problems: its 
poor public image. As the Yalt Banntr 
from 1963 shows, however, stereotypes 
don't readily change. "Last fall," the 
Banntr reads, "members of TO 
returned to find that the painters were 
working at presumably top speed to 
'rehabilitate' each and every room .... 
Two or at the most three were always 
on the job while the fourth was passing 
out the coffee for the continual coffee 
break. Rumor has it that one student 
returned to his room to find a painter 
fast asleep in his bed." But just as 
public opinion resists change, Physical 
Plant remains equally stubborn. New 
rnanagers and technology haven't 
helped poor worker-management rela-
tions or sped up daily repairs. Given 
enough time, Physical Plant seems 
able to fix anything on campus-
except itself.
