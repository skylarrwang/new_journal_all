The workers wonder why they have 
such an unrealistic schedule. The 
management wonders why the workers 
can't keep on schedule. And the 
students simply wonder why the sink 
still leaks. Short on efficiency, Physical 
Plant has been controversial ever since 
it was founded as the Yale University 
Service Bureau in 1918. Roy Dulac, a 
mason at Yale for 33 years, says people 
blame Physical Plant for the majority 
of the University's maintenance 
problems. "They say, 'It's them, it's 
them, it's them.' It's not us, it's the 
system. The system hasn't functioned 
since the day they put it in here. They 
take the same system and they modify 
it. Within six months it's right back 
where it used to be." 

Dulac has gone through more 
managers and supervisors than he 
cares to count and has witnessed three 
efficiency companies fail 
in their 
attempts to reorganize Physical Plant, 
in 
1967, 1973, and 1977. Understandably, he and many workers like 
him 
feel skeptical of a 
new 
management and computer system. 
Based on his past experience, Dulac 
predicts that these changes will merely 
continue the long series of unsuccessful 
attempts to improve Physical Plant. 
"Come in like a blaze of glory and 
fade into the woodwork," Dulac 
says. Physical Plant, which services all of campus 
except the Medical School, is divided 
into a central and a science area. Each 
has a control center to process all the 
jobs and a crew made up of skilled 
tradespeople such as carpenters and 
electricians. The 50 administrative 
workers at Physical Plant include 
control center specialists who take 
phone calls, 
determine a job's 
importance, and decide which trade 
suits the work. 

To coordinate daily services, the 
administration introduced a 
computer system about a year and a 
half ago. Before, job assignments were 
handwritten on tickets, and workers 
had no way to keep track of them. If a 
ticket got lost, the job never got done. 
The new computer serves to avoid 
such problems. Control center 
specialists enter each job into the 
computer, which then prints out a 
ticket. The trade supervisors then 
distribute the tickets to their workers. 
At the end of the day, the tradespeople 
turn their tickets back in to the 
computer and it does some thinking. Is 
the job complete or on hold? Does it 
require a follow-up by someone from 
another trade? If the job is incomplete, 
the computer generates a new ticket 
and the same worker continues the 
next day. Every job has a time 
estimate, and the computer determines 
not only who did the work, but how 
long they took. The system does allow 
workers to justify any delays on the 
backs of their computer tickets. 

Although this computer system will 
not eliminate the backlog of jobs, 
current administrators hope that it 
might expedite the work process. But 
Christa Soell (DC 
'88) and her 
roommate wish some improvements 
had come sooner. When they moved 
into their room last year, they were 
told that their ceiling still leaked after a 
year and a half. They left for the 
summer with no response to their calls 
to Physical Plant. When they returned 
to the same room in September, the 
leak had progressed to the bathroom 
and the water was prying loose the tiles 
in the shower. Paralyzed from the 
waist down, Soell's roommate 
happened to be under those tiles when 
they fell, and she could not move out of 
the way. 

In labeling a job first priority 
control center specialists must find the 
situation threatening to life, limb, 
property, or "the Yale investment." 
Sometimes an urgent request also 
qualifies, as a short walk through a 
freshly painted dean's apartment will 
demonstrate. 

Yet students and 
Physical Plant often disagree on the 
definition of urgency. When Timothy 
Shoettle's (GE '90) showerhead broke 
off one day last year, he reported the 
damage to Physical Plant immediately. 
Two weeks later, he started to call 
irregularly for about two months. With 
no results and the inconvenience 
seeming less and less temporary, the 
eight people who once used the shower 
began a call-a-thon. They called three 
times a day, every day for a month. 
Finally, Shoettle took his showerhead 
over to Physical Plant, walked into an 
office, exchanged a few angry words, 
and got action. 

The computer may prevent these 
kinds of delays and oversights. But a 
computer can't account for human 
error. Often, stalls occur because 
supplies are inaccessible. 
Workers 
have to fill out a form for charging 
materials to the job. But according to 
Bob Collins, a plumber at Yale for 27 
years, "About a third of the time they 
don't have the 
materials in the 
stockroom." Then the worker has to go 
over to the supply house and fill out 
another form. "The logistics of 
working here make it impossible to

plumber at Yale for

impossible to work a 
full eight-hour day." 

work a full eight-hour day," Collins 
said. 

Gaining access to work areas poses 
another problem. 
When Braun 
assumed his post, workers had only 
two people they could go to for keys: 
the lockshop foreman, who has access 
to all master keys, or the college 
secretary, who can provide access to a 
residential college. If they could not 
reach the lockshop foreman and had a 
job in a college, workers often faced the 
inconvenience 
of waiting for 
the 
secretary to arrive in the morning, 
sometimes an hour later than they 
started work. According to workers, 
however, UPS and Federal Express 
delivery people have keys. Braun has 
tried to smooth out such flaws and has 
already simplified access to keys on 
Old Campus. 

In denying 
the workers easy 
entrance to colleges and dorm rooms, 
University 
has indicated 
that it includes Physical Plant workers 
among 
its 
security 
risks. 
Many 
workers resent the fact that Yale does 
not trust them. Dulac asked, "Why 
don't they give me a uniform of black 
and white stripes so they can see me 
coming?" An incident of fraud exposed 
this fall served to fuel the negative 
image of workers. Between 1983 and 
1986, an electrician's supervisor and a 
North Haven electrical contractor 
cheated Yale out of several thousand 
dollars worth of material. Workers 
claim that during the investigation FBI 
agents came to their houses to search 
for missing material. They came while 
the workers were out on strike, and 
conducted all checks at the same time 
to prevent one worker from warning 
another. 

In the fraud case, although the 
management 
faced 
the criminal 
charges, the workers did not escape 
suspicion. Such suspicion surfaces in 
their everyday jobs. According to 
Dulac, "They say, 'The workers are 
stealing the batteries, the workers are 
stealing this, the workers are stealing 
that!' 
It's always on us, not the 
management, God forbid!" Dulac feels 
that greater distrust has emerged in re-
cent years and has contributed to 
Physical Plant's inefficiency. 

He and a number of his co-workers 
feel that poor service has harmed their 
image among students. 
Students 
stereotype workers based on glimpses 
of them 
performing jobs around 
campus, rather than on knowledge of 
what particular workers do. Allan 
Tulchin (TD '90), said recently, "Who 
is in the pool room and the TV room 
during the day? More often than not 
it's the workers." Collins admits that 
the system allows for less motivated 
workers. "There are all kinds of ways 
you can dupe the system. If you didn't 
want to work, you could absolutely not 
work eight hours a day and you could 
look like you did a million things," he 
said. Since workers and managers 
stay at Yale for very long. When Lewis 
Beach (YC '28) retired as manager in 
the late 1960's, he took with him both a 
record of 40 years of service and a 
tradition of stable management. "In 
1970 I went through seven bosses in three 
months. We used to take a dart board and 
throw darts against the wall to see 
who the boss of the week would be," 
Dulac said. During a recent year-and-
a-half period, Physical Plant did not 
have anyone officially in charge, and 
the vice-president of Finance and 
Administration had to moonlight as 
part-time manager. When seeking new 
management, Yale often does not 
promote from within, because workers 
don't want supervisory 
positions. 

Collins, a leadman—or head worker—in 
plumbing, was offered a promotion to 
foreman. But he didn't want a disciplinary position since his brother-in-law 
and son, as well as his friends, work in 
Physical Plant. 

Because Yale hires from outside the 
ranks of workers, its administrators do 
not always know the trades or the 
system. "Sometimes they come to us, 
and ask 'what should we do?' What do 
they mean 'what should we do?' What 
the hell are they the boss for?" Dulac 
said. Many workers feel that they must 
compensate for ineffective supervisors. 
"Nobody has any power. Nobody can 
make a decision over there. Years ago 
we went to the boss and the boss made 
a decision. Nowadays you're more or 
less on your own most of the time," 
Dulac said. Workers who find them-
selves "on their own" often look to each 
other for support. They trust their 
leadman for advice more than they 
trust their supervisor. This preference 
only widens the distance between 
workers and management. 

Braun hopes to improve worker-
management communication. He has 
instituted a new policy of meeting with 
his 50 supervisors every three months. 
In his office, behind a large oak desk 
spread with copies of Army Times, he 
described this new approach. "It gives 
a supervisor, even two or three levels 
removed from me, an opportunity to 
talk to me knowing I will never go to
