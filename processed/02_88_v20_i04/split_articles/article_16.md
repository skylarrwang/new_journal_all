It's a good walk from the center of town 
to the Institute of Sacred Music, up 
Prospect Street past Farnham Mem-
orial Gardens. +he building stands like 
E a one-room schoolhouse on the edge of 
:=Â· town, poised on the top of the slope

isolation. Despite its distance from the 
center of the University and the paths 
of most Yale students, the Institute is a 
crossroads, a meeting place for the 
worlds of music and religion. 

Begun in 1973, the Institute bridges 
Yale's School of Music and Divinity 
School, two professional programs 
which are traditionally separated at 
other universities. The Institute of 
Sacred Music (ISM) embraces the 
interdisciplinary study of all arts and 
religion, though its primary orien-
tation 
is Christian. 
Endowed 
independently of Yale by Clementine 
Tangeman and Irwin Sweeney Miller. 
Yale Corporation member, the 
Institute provides the University with 
professors whose interests and exper-
tise extend beyond one field of study. 

Originally, the founders visualized 
ISM as part of a Yale music complex 
in downtown New Haven. When the 
University abandoned these plans, the 
fledgling Institute established a 
foothold on the back quadrangle of the 
Divinity School. Only the dim outline 
of a backboard high on the wall of the 
convocation hall remains as a reminder 
that the building, in an earlier life, 
served as the .gymnasium for Divinity
