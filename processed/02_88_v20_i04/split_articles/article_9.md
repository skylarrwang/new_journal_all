real estate developers, tax revisionists, 
community volunteers and city 
officials concerned with the homeless, 
and a formerly homeless person. 
As a 
non-proht 
organ1zat10n, 
HOME receives federal low-income 
housing tax credits for each unit 
purchased. HOME's corporation can 
then use the credits as collateral to 
acquire low-interest loans from banks, 
which in turn are matched by cash 
donated by Yale, New Haven, and the 
Ford Foundation. 

The course began in the fall of 1985 
as a legal clinic. Students would visit 
the homeless at local shelters such as 
the Columbia House to inform them of 
their legal benefits and rights. They 
found that this approach failed to 
attack the problem at its root. 
"The need then was not for our 
advice," Stearns recalled. 
"Our 
homeless clients simply could not find 
affordable housing." Widespread 
redevelopment had left New Haven's 
residents with high rents and few 
alternatives. The following year, 
Stearns, with other students, expfored 
different options, researched possible 
funding, and combed the city for low-
income property units. "We felt the 
money and energy fC?r our course 
should not go into litigation, but rather 
into creation," Stearns said. 

Barnett stresses that the success of 
the course relies on the cooperation of 
the private and public sectors. "It's not 
just Yale that is working to provide 
housing; 
it's 
a 
triangle coalition 
between the Law School, the govern-
ment, and local community agencies," 
he said. 

Solomon believes that government 
agencies make possible a course like 
HOME. "As a class, we basically 
develop (public] subsidies and credits 
through the private market," he said. 
The government, he believes, has the 
resources and the inclination to help 
the homeless; HOME provides the 
mechanism.

**Title: Greater Glory**

During the first game, the inmates 
looked threatening. Every two weeks 
last spring, and starting again last 
week, the members of Athletes in 
Action (AlA), 
Yale C hristian 
mmtstry of Campus Crusade for 
Christ, 
trekked 60 miles to play 
basketball 
at 
the medium-security 
Danbury Federal Prison. "At first, the 
inmates were staring at us, but we 
really liked them, and I think they 
liked us as we got to know them," Steve 
Essick (TC '90) said. "It gave us a real 
chance to practice what we had been 
learning in our Bible study sessions 
and 
to 
influence the 
inm ates 
positively." 

Yale Chaplain Miles Ahrens, 
himself a former college athlete, leads 
these weekly interdenominational 
discussions for 25 male and female 
undergraduate athletes. The students 
play a variety of team sports, ranging 
from football to swimming. Ahrens 
believes that Christianity can help 
competitors both on and off the field. 
In addition, he feels that athletes, as 
role models, have a unique platform 
from which to spread Christianity. 
"Since athletes endorse other things, 
why shouldn't they endorse a lifestyle?" 
Ahrens asked. 

As he has for seven years, Ahrens 
quotes verses from the Bible during 
AlA 
meetings and 
forms 
small 
problem-solving groups to alleviate 
athletes' worries. 
The discussion 
focuses on fear of failure, injury, and 
embarrassment. "Athletes tend to have 
self-satisfying goals- to be undefeated 
and to lead in tackles. These goals can 
hurt them when they don't reach them. 
But if their goal, as a Christian, is to 
glorify God, then whether they win or 
lose, they reach their maximum goal," 
Ahrens said . 

Given the three last-second wins in 
the past football season, many players 
felt overwhelming pressure to meet 
their own 
their spectators' 
expectations. For Essick, a varsity 
football player, some of that tension 
was relieved by his feeling that "God is 
a lot more important than football. 
When I missed a tackle it wasn't the 
end of the world as long as I played up 
to my full potential to represent God." 

Brent Hinkle (SM '90), like many 
AlA athletes, joined similar organ-
izations before college, such as the 
Fellowship for Christian Athletes. At 
Yale, Hinkle followed up on his high 
school experience by joining AlA. 
With Ahrens, he continues to combine 
athletics and his religious beliefs in 
order to enhance his performance and 
to affect others with his Christian 
philosophy. Hinkle believes, "Being an 
athlete can give you the chance to 
influence people positively. It takes a 
while, but you can change people's 
attitudes."
