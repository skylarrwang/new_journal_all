"The aesthetics 
becomes ethics, the 
language becom es 
morality." 
Tomas Venclova emerges from his 
tiny office and walks across the hall of 
HGS into his Russian poetry class. 
The seminar room is spacious, but 
Venclova charts his course around the 
disarray of chairs with concentration. 
Once in his seat, he bobs his head 
formally and greets his students like a 
nervous host. They respond politely, 
knowing that as V enclova immerses 
himself in Pushkin's poetry, 
his 
awkwardness will fall away. He speaks 
more quickly, the flow interrupted by 
small mistakes in his English. The 
articles "a" and "the" still give him 
fits- he 
guesses that only 
native 
Americans can figure out when to use 
them. And although he has lived in the 
United States for 11 years, ever since 
fleeing the Soviet-dominated nation of 
Lithuania, Tomas Venclova retains 
the air of a poet in exile. 
A stanza from his poem "Autumn in 
Copenhagen" reflects this experience: 
for every atom's long since been replaced 
in your body. The dislocated 
consciousness fumbles 
in the language, as in a desk drawer. The 
din of declensions, conjunctions, 
negations, 
the blind 
incessancy of particles, the cramped 
phrases, and only occasionally, 
dry (like something someone else 
experiences, but breath-taking) pain 
and silence. 

Venclova's poetry reveals more of his 
emotion than does his conversation. 
He can discuss his life in the Soviet 
Union without inflection. Apparently 
~t is -~. story he has told many times 
before. 

Venclova grew up in a household 
which taught him to command a 
language rather than find confusion 
within it. 
Born in 1937 in the 
strategically vulnerable 
nation of 
Lithuania, Venclova and his family 
had to flee their home in Klaipeda 
when Hitler invaded in 1939. T hey 
moved to the city of K aunas and later 
settled in the nation's capital, Vilnius. 
Venclova's father, a left-wing writer, 
turned to orthodox socialist realism 
when 
the Soviet U nion annexed 
Lithuania in the Second W orld W ar. 


The elder Venclova became a prom-
inent literary figure in the newly 
Sovietized state. He penned the lyrics 
to the new Soviet-Lithuanian national 
anthem. 

His father's prestige resulted in a life 
of relative privilege for Venclova, who 
enjoyed access to his father's official 
and unofficial libraries. He began to 
write poetry, which his father praised, 
but which authorities condemned as 
"decadent." He subscribed to Marxist 
doctrine for a while, but on November 
4, 1956, when Soviet tanks rolled into 
Hungary to suppress strains of liberal-
ization, Venclova lost faith in Soviet 
communism. He refused to alter the 
style of his poetry, and augmented this 
insolence with attacks on human rights 
violations within the Soviet Union. In 
response, Soviet authorities snatched 
copies of his poetry from the book-
stores. Venclova also lost his job 
teaching at Vilnius University, where 
he had lectured on literaturf and 
semiotics. His friends suffered;· more 
violent fates. KGB agents reputedly 
murdered Konstantin Bogatyrev, the 
Russian translator of Rilke, to whom 
Venclova dedicated a memorial poem: 
I turned the key 
that bared the corridor. 
My heart beat raggedly, weighed down 
my breast. 
It's true: within the confines of this state 
Death even, sometimes, was an accident. 

Although the government banned his 
poetry, Venclova was able to support 
himself as a translator, a vocation he 
had practiced all his life. His transla-
tions of T.S. Eliot's The Wasu Land 
drew acclaim, as did those of W. H. 
Auden's verses. He also translated 
Russian poetry. especiallv the works of 
writers like lsvetaeva and Akhmatova 
who rebelled against the growing 
totalitarianism of the Stalinist state. 
These men and women helped shape 
his poetic ideals-"just to give some 
meaning to the universe that 
surrounded them, not only by their 
work, but by their behavior, their life." 

Poetry for Venclova creates mean-
ing and purpose in an environment 
which seems senseless. He sees the 
threat of "nonexistence" everywhere, 
and uses his poetry to. hold it at bay. 
Venclova explains,"The poetry is one 
of the last possibilities in our world to 
remind 
people of some morality 
questions." He views good poetry as 
moral or ethical because its very 
structure stands in opposition to the 
chaos and meaninglessness which have 
gained power in Eastern Europe. "It's 
the only solid point you can find in the 
universe," he says. "It's just this firm 
structure of the poetry. The aesthetics 
becomes ethics, the language becomes 

Venclova's apocalyptic vision drew 
him to the company of other poets and 
artists who share his perspective. 
Joseph 
Brodsky became such a 
soulmate. Brodsky, who now lives in 
New York and received the Nobel 
Prize for literature in 1987, was a 
Russian poet living in Leningrad when 
Venclova first met him. Venclova 
considers Brodsky the greatest living 
Russian poet, and refers to him 
constantly as a model for his own life. 
The two poets have dedicated works to 
each other. 
Venclova's poem to 
Brodsky, "The Shield of Achilles," 
speaks to the power of poetry to hold 
back the nothingness which threatens 
to conquer. 
Peace be to you. To you and me, both, 
peace. 
Let it be dark. And let the seconds hurtle. 
Through densest space, that dream of 
many layers, 
I read each chapter your pen's released. 
Whole cities disappear. In nature's stead, 
A white shield, counterweight to non-
existence. 
In its engraving both our different eras 
Lie double-etched. 

Last December Brodsky selected 
V enclova as one of ten friends who 
would accompany him to Stockholm 
for the Nobel ceremonies. The formal 
aspects of the occasion intimidated 
Venclova, who is not always at home 
with social niceties. "The main 
problem was to fmd tailcoats for the 
big evening at the Stockholm town 
hall, where the Swedish King and 
Queen were present, so everybody was 
expected to be in a tailcoat. It was a so-
called white tie evening, the first such 
in my life, and I hope the last.one 
also," he laughs. 

When his anti-Soviet poetry forced 
Brodsky to head for exile in the West, 
Venclova gave his friend a bottle of 
liquor and asked him to drink it with 
W. H. Auden. Brodsky heeded his 
wishes, and with Auden, toasted the 
poet. Venclova was soon to follow 
Brodsky's path to the West. 

As a result of his increasingly anti-
Soviet convictions, Venclova became 
interested in the Helsinki Group in 
Moscow. This committee monitored 
and publicized Soviet violations of the 
Helsinki Accord, a Soviet-approved 
international agreement which 
outlined 
mm1mum standards of 
human freedoms that each member 
nation promised to honor. Soviet 
citizens approached the Moscow 
group, reporting government 
persecution, harassment in the 
workplace, and restriction on travel 
abroad. Lithuanians decided to 
organize their own Helsinki group in 
1976, which Venclovajoined, knowing 
it might result in imprisonment.

continued, Venclova received more 
signs that 
the government was 
displeased with his activities. He 
explains that 
request 
for 
a 
telephone in his Vilnius apartment had 
been delayed 
months, 
as 
is 
common in the Soviet Union. He 
waited and complained, but nothing 
helped- until one day an American 
came to v1s1t. The VISitOr brought 
Venclova a clipping from the New York 
Review of Books, in which the recently 
emigrated Brodsky described the 
persecution Venclova faced in the 
Soviet Union. Venclova stood in his 
apartment discussing his case with the 
American, when suddenly there was a 
knock on the door. Workmen had 
arrived to 
install 
the 
telephone, 
Venclova explains, "and the phone was 
apparently already with the bugging 
devices in it." 

In 1976, Venclova's boldness 
reached its peak when he and other 
members of his group staged a 
Moscow press conference to tell 
Western reporters about repression in 
Lithuania. "So we went to Moscow on 
three different trains, just in case if 
anybody is arrested, the other ones will 
remain free. But nobody was arrested, 
we reached Moscow all three of us, and 
we arranged a press conference in Yuri 
Orlov's [a prominent physicist] · 
apartment in Moscow." The group 
told reporters about the situation in 
Lithuania, with the dissident Anatoly 
Scharansk y 
acting as English 
translator. "It was a date that made 
history in Lithuania, or for Lithuania," 
Ven clova says. 

Surprisingly, 
authorities did not interfere with the 
press conference, the first of its kind. 
Within six months, however, every 
participant except Venclova had been 
arrested on what he calls "trumped-up 
charges." Most were sent to Siberia. 
Venclova escaped arrest, 
partially 
because of Western pressure. Play-
wright Arthur Miller, then American 
president of PEN, an international 
organization of writers, wrote letters to 
the Soviets in defense ofVenclova. Brod-
sky publicized the cause in New York 
hoping that he could embarrass Soviet 
authorities into releasing the dissident. 
Czeslaw Milosz, a Polish emigre poet 
teaching at the University of California 
at Berkeley, invited Venclova to come 
lecture on Russian literature. Milosz, 
a 1980 Nobel laureate, says that he 
came to admire "\! enclova when he was 
still 
in 
Poland and 
received an 
underground copy of his poems, one of 
which he translated in.to Polish. He 
learned of Venclova's situation from 
Polish friends: "Our university worked 
for nearly two years to get him out." 
H e speculates that the reputation of 
Venclova's father may have saved 'him 
from arrest to this point, but that this 
protection might not have continued. 
" Immediately after this 
press 
conference, I came back to Vilnius, 
and I was told by my mother and my 
wife that I was invited to the Ministry 
df the Interior," Venclova says. "Now, 
the Ministry of the Interior is not the 
same as it is the the United States. It is 
police." H e was certain as he left for 
the meeting that he faced arrest. "So I 
went there, with some anxiety, but at 
that time I was still very stubborn, very 
enthusiastic"-a smile plays on his 
lips-"about my dissident activities, 
and pretty sure that it is well worth to 
serve some time in prison for this 
case." To his surprise, Venclova was 
not arrested. 

Instead, 
authorities 
encouraged him to accept his invi-
tation to Berkeley. They issued him a 
passport. 

When Vendova learned that fellow 
poets were campaigning for his release, 
he considered the implications of 
leaving his home. 
He 
received 
postcards from Brodsky on the other 
side of the world, attempting to explain 
what the new life was like. H e con-
