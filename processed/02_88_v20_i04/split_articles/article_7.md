EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
I enjoyed the three articles on AIDS in 
the December 4 issue. In the last 
paragraph of page 20 (first of page 21), 
however, Sachs appears to list being 
tested by donating blood as an option. 
That is totally inappropriate- seri-
ously so. It is unethical to go to a blood 
bank to be tested. The reason is that 
falsely negative results are sufficiently 
common so that some blood recipients 
will die as a result of such behavior. No 
person who believes that he/she may 
realistically be positive can ethically 
donate blood! 

Being tested in the blood bank 
setting 
is 
also -ill-advised 
since 
counselling is not done. No one should 
ever willingly be tested for HIV 
antibodies without professional coun-
selling. 

Anyone can be tested anonymously, 
with pre- and post-test counselling, at 
the New H aven H ealth Department. 
Your name is never used and the result 
is never entered into your ~edical 
record. 

Sincerely, 
Alvin Novick, M.D.

**Title: NewsJournal Paper Chase**
**Author: Jennifer Sachs**

Anyone who has considered getting 
tested for AIDS at U niversity Health 
Services (UH S) but feared that the 
results would appear on their charts 
should know that for the time being 
they can get a completely anonymous 
test here at Yale. While the AIDS 
testing policy at UHS mandates that 
physicians record patients' results in 
sealed envelopes on their medical 
charts (TN] 12/4/87), the Health 
Services has not fully implemented this 
policy. Instead, individual physicians 
have 
continued to determine the 
confidentiality of each test however 
they see fit. 

Recording all results will have 
several benefits. People infected with 
the human immunodeficiency virus, 
which can cause AIDS, may need 
special treatment. In addition, health 
care providers who come into contact 
with a patient's bodily fluids may 
determine whether they risk infection. 
To avoid stigmatizing people who take 
the test, UH S will put envelopes, 
empty, on ten percent of all charts. 
According to D r. Daniel Rowe, the 
director of UHS, 
the 
Board of 
University H ealth approved this new 
policy only last week. However, ~e 
said in early November that "in the 
meantime, we are proceeding under 
the new policy. We are operating as if 
that were our policy." 

Dr. R obert DeBernardo, the AIDS 
coordinator at UHS, denied that the 
policy was to have been implemented 
last fall. He said that he had not 
distributed instructions on "envelop-
ing" 
results 
until 
middle of 
January, but that caregivers had 
followed the policy since then. At least 
two students who took the "AIDS test" 
at UHS in early December confirmed 
that 
their 
provider, 
Dr. Jane 
Rasmussen, assured them that their 
tests would not appear on their medical 
records. "She told me the test was a 
personal thing between me and her," 
one of these students said. "My underÂ·-
standing was that it was not going on 
my file in any way." H e said that if he 
had thought the test would appear on 
his medical record, he would not have 
consented to it. 

Rasmussen said that she still does 
not record test results. "I just say, 
'H ere. It's yours.' That's how I've been 
doing it and that's how the providers I 
know have been doing it," she said. 
She explained that until she comes 
across a patient who tested positive, 
"all these things are not big terrible 
issues." Despite the insistence of both 
R owe and DeBernardo that physicians 
have started to heed the guidelines of 
the new policy, Rasmussen said she 
has no plans to begin "enveloping" 
immediately. 

Rasmussen's reluctance stems from 
a simple factor- the lack of envelopes 
on any of the charts. "I don't know 
what kind they're going to use, and I'm 
not going to use my own envelope. 
That would be like a red flag," she said. 
R asmussen said that as soon as the 
record room supplies envelopes she 
will begin using them. For now, the 
efforts ofUHS to find a coherent AIDS 
policy continue 
to suffer from 
some confusion, 
miscommunication, 
and 
now from an apparent shortage in the 
supply closet.
