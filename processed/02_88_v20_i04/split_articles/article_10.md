**Title: What Price Freedom?**
**Author: Jonathan Hoyt**
**Page number(s): 8-9**

Shopping Period, says History Pro-
fessor Frank Turner, is expensive. He 
demonstrates this 
by 
simple 
arithmetic: two weeks times eight 
semesters equals 16 weeks, or a full 
semester of a student's Yale career 
spent selecting courses. At this years 
tuition, that costs $6,060. Turner's logic 
would surprise most students, who sel-
dom question the freedom of this system. 
But professors, who must ride out 
students' early semester whims, have a 
different viewpoint. Many of them 
believe that Shopping Period impedes 
serious work. Students, they feel, buy 
their freedom at too high a price. 

"What worries me is the consumer-
ism," says Lila Freedman, editor of the 
Yale College Programs of Study (the "Blue 
Book"). She fears that students choose 
a class that amuses them over one that 
would educate them. 

A 
host of 
subjective 
factors creeps into the 
decision process: where a course is 
located, 
whether the 
professor 
is 
entertaining, perhaps even what the
instructor looks like. "ll doesn't sell 
short the serious students," Berkeley 
College Master Robin Winks says, 
"but it caters to immaturity, and caters 
to those who look for 'guts."' Students 
may base their selection on a course's 
workload rather than its content. 

Further, 
according 
to Associate 
Professor of History William Cronon, 
Shopping Period promotes Yale's "star 
system," by which certain courses 
become huge solely because of the 
professor's popularity. "The rich get 
richer and the poor get poorer," Winks 
says. 

To avoid low enrollment, professors 
occasionally alter the style of their first 
lectures. Young instructors, Turner 
says, may cram too much into these 
lectures; later they run out of things to 
say. Others try to be funny. "There is a 
temptation of a cheap sell," Psychology 
Professor James Dittes says. Some pro-
fessors, however, try to scare students 
off, 
either to reduce their own 
workload or to eliminate "dead wood" 
le's Re
in seminars -that is, students who do 
not participate in discussions. 

Shopping Period also imposes a 
psychological strain on instructors. 
"You feel like you're talking to people 
in a shooting gallery or on a conveyor 
belt," says Eve Sandberg, 
acting 
instructor in Political Science. Gene 
Outka, Religious Studies professor, 
says that when students walk out, "You 
wonder if you've checked your appear-
ance that morning." 

Unless profe~~ors bury their noses in 
lecture notes, they can't help noticing 
the rudeness of "shoppers." Steve 
Gillon, a fellow of Silliman College 
and an instructor in History, recalls 
two male students who stood on oppo-
site sides of the classroom during his 
introductory lecture of History 131. 
When one looked at the other with an 
inquisitive shrug of the shoulders, 
Gillon couldn't help looking himself to 
see what the other student's reaction 
would be. "H e made a sign with his 
hand as if to say 'so-so,"' Gillon recalls. 
He says other shoppers take one look at 
the syllabus, frown, and then leave, 
perhaps banging into a chair or two on 
their way out. "Unless you're really 
brash a.J)d gutsy, and have a good ego, 
it's tough," says Turner. "Everybody 
has the same feeling of despair and 
fear," agrees Jennifer Wicke, director 
of undergraduate studies in Literature. 
"I ask myself, 'Did I do something 
wrong?'" 

According to Turner, 
shopping 
"institutionalizes bad manners" and is 
"disruptive to the entire process" of 
teaching a 
course. 
The 
Academic 
Haruiboolcfor Freshmen agrees. On page 
14, it reads, 

The course selection period is not 
what some students may lead you to 
believe it is. It is, for example, 
popularly called among students the 
â€¢shopping period." That phrase is, in 
fact, a misnomer, and has some 


seriously misleading implications. 
Students may think of themselves as 
"shoppers," but members of the 
faculty do not conceive of themselves 
as vendors, nor their courses as 
goods on display . . . 

Under no 
circumstances should you leave a classroom 
in tlu middle of a lecture. 

Despite the HandbooiCs distrust of the 
connotations of "shopping," the 
preferred 
term "Course Selection 
Period" hasn't quite made it into the 
Yale vernacular. 

Shopping 
Period 
creates knotty 
logistical problems as well. If a course 
is larger than expected, the Co-op runs 
out of books, and the professor must 
scramble to find a new classroom and 
extra teaching assistants. Turner 
laments the fact that TAs often have no 
time to prepare for their responsi-
bilities. "The course billows forth, and 
TAs have to swim." Casual shoppers 
also consume mounds of syllabi: Last 
semester, Sandberg had to make new 
ones three times. An advantage 6f the 
pre-registration system is that ' each 
department can match the "supply" of 
courses with student "demand." 

Yale abandoned the pre-registration 
system in the fall of 1971. Previously, 
students could change their courses at 
the beginning of the term by sub-
mitting a form. Registrar John Meeske 
OE '74) recalls huge numbers of course 
changes, perhaps as many as 50,000 a 
year. It often took until the next 
semester to establish final enrollment 
figures. The late dean of Under-
graduate Studies, Martin Griffin, was 
among those 
who 
supported 
the 
"shopping period" idea. According to 
Meeske, Griffin's philosophy was that 
"students are going to end up in the 
course they want regardless of the 
regulations." The faculty have debated 
Shopping Period occasionally, the last 
time about four years ago. They voted 
to keep it. 

Despite complaints, instructors 
"You feel like you're 
talking to people in a 
shooting gallery or on 
a conveyor belt." 
changed. As Political Science Professor 
H. Bradford Westerfield puts it, "I'm 
enthusiastically in favor of it .... I 
don't want any students who will regret 
being here." After some experience, 
instructors develop a thicker skin. A 
student's departure in the middle of 
lecture, after all, is not always a 
judgment. History Professor Donald 
Kagan says, "People who worry about 
[Shopping Period] are missing the 
point." 

Shopping Period seems necessary 
when the inaccuracies of the Yale 
College Programs of Study are taken into 
account. Sandberg was dismayed to 
discover that the Blue Book editors had 
dramatically shifted the emphasis in 
her own course description. Similarly, 
colleague's description of his 
International Trade seminar had been 
cut from a paragraph to a sentence. 
With changes such as these, added to 
the swarm of last-minute alterations, 
students need to shop just to ensure 
that they get what they expect. 

Furthermore, according to Winks, 
Shopping Period maintains and 
enforces the "social contract" that exists 
between teacher and students: In order 
to attract students, instructors have to 
have syllabi ready, and they must 
present their subject in an interesting 
way. This contract encourages 
students not to disrupt lectures once 
they have enrolled in the class. Viewed 
in 
terms of the 
social contract, 
Shopping Period may help students to 
mature by forcing them to make 
educated choices. Wicke notes, "It's 
part of the self-directedness that we try 
to foster."
