When Henry "Sam" Chauncey Jr. (DC 
'57) announced recently that he would 
resign as president of the Science Park 
Development Corporation (SPDC), he 
startled many people in the Yale and 
New H aven communities. As soon as a 
search committee finds his replace-
ment, Chauncey will become president 
and chief executive officer of Gaylord 
Hospital, a rehabilitation center in 
Wallingford. 

Chauncey 
feels 
Science Park will benefit from a new 
perspective on its development. His 
decision also coincides with his own 
agenda . "Change is something that 
some people seek out," Chauncey said. 
"I am one of those guys that likes to do 
different things in life." 

From behind the scenes, Chauncey 
has supported a series of high-profile 
professors and presidents and has acted 
as a catalyst in the development of 
New H aven. H e worked in the Uni-
versity administration from 1957 to 
1981, serving in such positions as 
assistant to former President Kingman 
Brewster and secretary of the Univer-
sity. He also founded the Community 
Relations Office and was a member of 
the New Haven Development Com-
miSSIOn 
for more than 
10 years, 
initiating renovations of the Union 
R ailroad Station and the Taft H otel. 

Chauncey was selected as the first 
president of SPDC in 1981. With Yale 
University, the Olin Corporation, and 
the City of New H aven, he established 
the high-tech research park on the site 
of the Olin-Winchester gun factory, 
just west of Science Hill. The indus-
trial complex provides space and 
managerial facilities for new com-
panies and small businesses. With a 
budget 
that has increased 
from 
$51,000 to $5 million in six years, 
Science Park now houses about 110 
companies and has resources valued at 
well over $20 million. "Sam took a 
piece of paper which had a concept on 
it and made it into one of the most 
e ffective 
post-urban development 
pr~j ects in the country," said Matt 
Nemerson, president of the Greater 
New Haven Chamber of Commerce 
and former vice-president of SPDC 
under Chauncey. 

Chauncey was initially attracted to 
the proposal because of his interest in 
the revitalization of New H aven. "It 
seemed like a great opportun-ity io 
build a strong economic base in New 
H aven, which was losing 
it~ old 
industrial economic base," he said. 
The project promised to encourage 
business and to stimulate the city's 
development. Richard Bowerman (BK 
'39, LAW '42), chairman of SPOC, 
believes 
that with the 
president's 
departure, people will realize how 
much they have taken Chauncey and 
his guidance for granted. 

But residents of the neighboring 
Newhallville-Dixwell community have 
criticized 
Science 
Park 
for 
not 
providing more employment oppor-
tunities. 
Willie Green, executive 
director of the Newhallville Neigh-
borhood Corporation, also voiced his 
dissatisfaction early in the project. 
However, since cultivating a relation-
ship with Chauncey, he has found him 
accessible and sensitive to the needs of 
the community. "Sam was responsible 
for opening many doors," Green said. 
"I fear that progress is going to come to 
a grinding 
halt unless the search 
committee can 
find another Sam 
Chauncey." Chauncey, 
however, 
remains confident in the search com-
mittee'~ ability to select a successor 
who will make Science Park into "the 
damnedest thing you've ever seen." 


**Title: A Landholding Class**

T o confront the shortage of housing for 
New H aven's homeless, a Yale Law 
School course called H ome Operations 
Management Enterprises (HOME) · 
assigned its students to design a 
program that 1 • would create and 
preserve low~i ncome residences. 

After two years of paperwork and 
fundraising, the students currently 
enrolled 
in 
course 
anticipate 
completion of the project. But their 
final product will not be a written 
report. By the middle of this year, 
· under the leadership of professors 
Michael Graetz and Robert Solomon, 
the corporation formed by the class will 
own over 130 units of low-income 
housing worth several million dollars. 

"The driving force of the class 
started as a vision," R oger Barnett 
(LAW :89) said. "But this year the 
vision came together." If the project 
succeeds, other cities, including New 
York, might duplicate it. The course 
had grown so complex that this year 
the professors recruited students from 
the Schools of Architecture, Public 
H ealth and Safety, and Management 
in addition to the 14 law students. 

Janet Stearns (LAW '88), a veteran 
HOME student, has watched the class 
progress. "The 
Mayor (Biagio 
DiLieto] has endorsed our program, 
and we are waiting for the approval of 
our board before we start purchasing 
the units," she said. The board , which 
makes all the final decisions, heads a 
non-profit corporation formed . by the 
students. They created the permanent 
leadership so that their . project will 
outlast their graduations. According to 
Solomon, "The class is an operating 
law ftrm, representing and advising 
this corporation." The board includes
