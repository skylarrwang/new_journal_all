his boss and say anything derogatory. 
It is a good way for me to manage my 
subordinates." But Braun does not 
meet with workers directly, and they 
feel frustrated that he does not hear 
their ideas. After all, they reason, they 
know best how the system works and 
doesn't work. "We've come up with 
some ideas to save them money and 
save them grief. But they don't want to 
listen to you because you don't have a 
degree behind you," Collins said. 
Collins' belief that Yale overlooks his 
opinion reveals workers' low morale. 
Though Braun recognizes this prob-
lem, his solution is limited. "One thing 
we don't have here at Yale is a good 
system to pat our employees on the 
back when they do a good job," he 
said. He has started a new employee-
of-the-month program in which a Uni-
versity officer will present the winner 
with a savings bond worth 50 dqllars. 
But some workers feel that the new 
computer system continues to lower . 
their morale. No monthly awarc(·will 
smooth out the kinks in that system. 
"Nobody seems to care as long as the 
numbers are right," said Collins. 
Because it emphasizes the time rate, 
rather than the quality of work, the 
system offers little reward for a job well 
done. 

Braun recognizes the workers' dis-
satisfaction, but he attributes it to their 
resistance to technological change. 
"Tradespeople traditionally don't like 
any kind of paper work. So when they 
have to fill out a single form it is hard 
for them to adjust," he said. But the 
workers can provide numerous 
examples of how the computer system 
does not suit the nature of their work. 
If they happen upon something that 
needs repair, they cannot just stop to 
fix it, because the computer will not 
give them credit for the job. "We are 
not factory workers. When you go to 
knock at a student's room and they've 
been up all night studying, you just 
can't go barging in and throw them 
out. They're the customers. You can't 
say, 'Let's go, I've got to work because 
I'm on a schedule.' .You can't do that 
here," Dulac said. The high demand 


for repairs at Yale requires a tightly 
controlled system. But the tickets and 
time schedules make workers feel that 
they no longer have the flexibility 
needed to perform daily repairs. 

The administration and the workers 
seem to agree on at least one problem: 
Physical Plant does 
not 
operate 
smoothly. According to Braun, "Until 
we get out of that cycle where everyone 
is running around answering calls all 
the time, we will never be able to have 
enough people to do what we need to 
do." Dulac, however, claims that the 
University has cut the number of 
workers in recent years, and he does 
not understand'this logic. Resting his 
hands heavily on a restaurant counter, 
Dulac said, "They say it doesn't seem 
to be working right, meanwhile they're 
getting rid of more and more people." 
He orders a· bottle of beer and 
chuckles, "You need this working 
. here." Workers who have been with 
Physical Plant as long as Dulac recall 
the elimination of whole trades and 
dramatic cutbacks in others. Although 
·Braun insists that Physical Plant has 
grown since the mid-1970's, the 
statistics show a 
more 
complete 
picture. In fact, the University has 
hired more lower skill level workers 
than tradespeople. Many workers say 
that these hiring practices lead to 
' greater inefficiency. 

The tradespeople in Physical Plant 
generally have the highest labor grade 
status that Yale offers, level 17, which 
corresponds to a wage rate. They had 
their labor level upgraded in the last 
contract 
in exchange 
for the 
introduction of lower labor grade 
building attendants 
into 
Physical 
Plant. Administrators claimed that the 
building attendants, each of whom acts 
as superintendent for two colleges, 
would speed up everyday repairs. But 
according to Ron Altieri, negotiator 
for Local 35 and an electrician in 
Physical Plant, "My concern is that 
they want to fill this- place with 
handymen, therefore eliminating the 
need for labor grade 17 people, -skilled 
tradespeople." 


Skepticism and •low morale complicate Allan Braun's efforts to improve worker-
management relations at Physical Plant. 
With fewer tradespeople, Yale must 
subcontract out more large mainten-
ance projects to the public sector. 
Physical Plant does get a chance to bid 
on these projects. According to union 
rules, Yale can subcontract out work 
normally done by Physical Plant 
workers if Physical Plant's bid is not 
competitive. 
And often 
it isn't. 
Depending on the job, Physical Plant 
often costs more. It has a high 
overhead- the price of running ~~ts 
operations- because of a large support 
service. 
Employees take calls and 
respond to emergencies 24 hours a 
day, seven days a week. These types of 
services create expenses which outside 
contractors don't have. In addition, 
tradespeople may lack the skills re-
quired for a project. Even if they had 
these skills, their daily routines would 
prevent 
them 
from keeping on 
schedule. 
Plant's unusual system 
rnakes it a 
poor competitor with 
outside firms. But some management 
experts think that Physical Plant has 
P<>tential. Charles Perrow and a group 
of other professors, many from the 
School of Management, volunteered to 
examine Physical Plant and to suggest 
structural improvements a few years 
ago. "The Universitv 
gav~ us an 
informal response. Bas.ically, 'We have 
a perfectly adequate personnel system 
and we don't need any help or anyone 
mucking around," Perrow said. 

The tradespeople and their union, 
l..ocaJ 35, share Perrow's optimism. 
l'hey want more workers, and hope 
Physical Plant's Trades Helper 
Program will bring them in. The 
union gained this seven-year training 
program during labor negotiations in 
1984. It allows workers to choose a 
trade 
and 
to 
receive on-the-job 
tra1ntng and class instruction. 
Manageme11t monitors the workers' 
progress as they move up the ladder 
from labor grade 9 to 17, one level 
every year. Currently, nine workers 
participate in the program, and the 
union would like to see more. They 
argue that the University benefits from 
well-trained workers familiar with the 
system. 

The existing training program opens 
a door to Physical Plant for women 
minorities. 
Although many 
women work on the administrative 
end, Physical Plant currently employs 
only three women in the central area 
and two in the science area. These 
women work in such capacities as 
building attendants and truck drivers 
-lower labor grade positions. Physical 
Plant 
also employs 
few 
minority 
workers. According to Altieri, "The 
University does not really meet the 
minimum requirement of 6.9 percent 
female and 25 percent minority. When 
they hire from outside they have to 
give preference to that ratio, which is 
an average based on the New Haven 
population. The University claims to 
have this percentage, but that is really 
a smoke screen. Rationally speaking, 
black people and women wind up in 
lower labor grade jqbs." 

According to Peter Vallone, the 
University's negotiator during this 
round of labor negotiations, Yale does
