students.
The sounds of
basketball have been traded for the
music of six practice organs and four
grand pianos crammed into a space
half the size of Woolsey Hall.
Perhaps because of its small size, the
Institute attracts far less attention than
the other professional programs on
campus. Before applying to the School
of Music, organ student J ohn Sherer
had never heard of the Institute of
Sacred Music. After graduating from
the Cincinnati Conservatory, where he
studied organ and music education,
Scherer was drawn to Yale by the
reputation of the organ faculty and of
Woolsey Hall's Newberry Memorial
Organ, one of the finest in the world.
"But once I got here," he explained, "I
realized the full potential of where I
was." In his first year at the School of
Music, Sherer learned of ISM and
decided to apply.

All Institute students are accepted
from either the Music School or the
Divinity School, and they complete
degree requirements in their origi~al
schools as normally enrolled students
do. ISM does not confer a degree and
has no established curriculum. Its
students take classes at the Institute
and at the Music and Divinity Schools;
its faculty teaches courses open to
students from both professional schools
as well as to Institute students.

The Institute's only requirements
are attendance at a weekly colloquium
and a final project in the students' last
academic year. The final project, in
the form of a research paper and a
performance or lecture, must address a
topic combining religion and the arts.
In addition, some Institute students
may, like Sherer, enroll in a dual
degree program that confers both the
Master of Arts in Religion (MAR) and
the Master of Music (MM) degrees
after three years. Perhaps its most
valuable resource,
the
Institute's
faculty members serve as advisers and
encourage the independent exploration
of topics and
issues
that cross
disciplinary lines.

For Marian Dolan, a second-year
choral conducting student who directs
Yale Freshman Chorus,
Institu te offers an opportunity to study
the intricacies of choral texts and music
in separate courses. According to her,
"What people encounter as they listen
[to a religious choral work J is the text
through the music. If I were just at the
School of Music, I would only wrestle
with the musical aspects of a piece."
Dolan hopes that her training will give
her a more complete understanding of
the music she rehearses with her
uuden~.


Since the Institute encourages field
work, its students are scattered among
the churches in the New Haven area as
musicians and assistant pastors. But
despite this emphasis on the actual
performance of music and liturgy,
Institute faculty members dismiss the
suggestion that ISM is merely a
practice ground for its music students.
"We are distinctly not a conservatory,"
asserted John Cook, the Institute's
director since 1984. "Our students
come here to get what they can't get in
a conservatory."

What students get is a unique
education which integrates the study of
theology and the artistic expression of
faith. The disciplines converge at the
meeting of the colloquium, the em-
bodiment of the Institute's inter-
disciplinary philosophy. Each week,
the Institute's students and faculty
gather for a lecture and discussion of
academic and social issues in the arts
and religion. "In colloquium, we are
constantly engaged at the nexus where
art, liturgy, and worship come to-
gether," Cook said. "It's a meeting
place for the talents and the minds of
the Institute." Colloquium topics range
from
the secular influences on
Handel's Messiah to Christian art in
the Third World to music in con-
temporary black churches.

Although
faculty
and
v1sltmg
professors deliver most of the lectures,
occasionally students,
like Dolan,
present their final projects at the
Wednesday afternoon meetings.
Dolan's project, which she researched
for nearly a year, deals with the
evolving relationship between
organized religion an d contemporary
Christian music. "Two h undred years
ago, when churches patronized the
arts,
art re flected
theology," she
explained.
Now, Christian artists
attempt to em ploy popular music, a
medium totally beyond the control of
the established church, to convey the
message of the Gosp.el. Their efforts
raise ethical questions for Dolan about
the place today's Christian music has
in religion. "Should a Christian artist
like Amy Grant be sold under a secular
label? Should
she
be singing m

churches or Madison Square Garden?"

The Institute's approach transforms
some students' perspectives on the
performance of music in a worsl)ip
setting. "Before I came [to ISM],
music was personal," Sherer explained.
"It was me, the pe1·son, and the
keyboard. And the audience. Now, I
have a clear understanding of who I
play for and why. I see it as more of a
Yehicle for the person in the pew to
come closer to the Spirit." In his field
work at Trinity Church on the Green
and the Episcopal Church at Yale,
Sherer experiences a "magic moment"
when liturgy and music work together.
"They feed off of each other. They
create sort
of a
heightening of
awareness." He paused for a moment,
and then offered an example. "Before,
I would have been comfortable playing
a hymn. I even used to have a formula
set-loud on the first verse, softer,
then a little louder, then the last verse
as loud as the first. With the Institute,
that all goes out the window." Now,
Sherer approaches the organ's console
as a minister approaches the pulpit,
trying to complement the liturgy of a
worship service


For those who do not study music,
the Institute presents a different range
of challenges. Joanna Weber,
a
Divinity student, explained that ISM
encourages her to experiment with
different approaches to her work. A
second-year MAR candidate, Weber
feels that theologians overstress the
importance of documents and ignore
the religious significance of artwork.
This term, she will be comparing the
aesthetic
principles of thirteenth
century Franciscan friars to the ideas
developed by Martin Luther over 200
years later. Weber's interdisciplinary
approach to history will allow her to go
beyond analyzing the
text of a
theological document. She hopes to
project herself into the artists'
environment to understand their
inspiration.

The Institute's approach to the
spiritual world sometimes causes
problems in the material one, namely
the difficulties of pursuing a course of
study between two or more profes-
sional schools. The Institute's hallway
echoes with complaints of schedules
with
conflicting
classes,

astronomical
parking fines levied
against students as they shuttle up and
down Prospect Hill.

More taxing still are the intellectual
demands of walking straight from a
class on Biblical exegesis to an Art
History lecture or a
conducting
seminar.
Weber admits
that "by
constantly shifting gears, you have the
sense that you're never getting a hold
on something. You have a half hold in
two
different
areas."
Frustrated
students can
turn
to
the strong
community that has developed among
students and faculty, centering on the
Institute's lounge. There, faculty and
students compare notes on theology,
music, or long days at class and work.

It is the students, musicians and
scholars from diverse backgrounds and
with different goals, that draw faculty
to the Institute. "It never occurred to
me to pursue an academic career," said
organist Tom Murray, an assistant
professor of music since 1981. "But
when the opportunity arose, I couldn't
pass it up. Working with gifted stu·
dents is one of the most satisfying
things I know." The reward·s are
simiiar for Paul Brainard, a pro-
fessor of musicology, who teaches


many dl\·mitv students in the intro-
ductorv cour;e Christianitv and thf Arts.
Braina.rd left a full professorship at
Princeton to join the ISM faculty.
"The purpose of most music depart-
ments." he observed. "is to produce
scholars who will go and teach other
scholars. It's a kind of cloning process.
It has its advantages but also some
disadvantages. I'm very happy to be
working with students whose profes-
sional interests arc not those of a
musicologist."

T he priorities of the Institute differ
from those of graduate schools and
even from those of more orthodox
professional schools. To Cook, the
Institute's mission is clear. "We arc
professional the way the Divinity
School or the Music School is profes-
sional. We are not a graduate school,
although research is an important part
of what we do. We continue to work-in
the middle of the dialogue between
worship and art forms, theology. aJild
Biblical studies." Although Instituie
students must stretch between many
disciplines and consequently jeopar-
dize their chance to master any, Weber·
feels that the flexibility they gain is
worth
risk.
"Someone
who's
wearing at least five different hats and
changing them quickly and efficiently,
that's an Institute student," she said.
"They're students,
they're
profes-
sionals,
they
give
concerts."
She
laughed. "You grow up pretty fast over
there."

For the Institute, 1988 marks the
end of the beginning of Tangeman and
Sweeney's religious and artistic
experiment. The last member of the
original faculty recently accepted a ·
position with the Episcopal Diocese of
Connecticut. But with the support of
the endowment and the enthusiasm of
its members, the Institute will continue
its exploration of music and faith, and
where they join company. After 15
years, even from the top of the hill, the
end is nowhere in sight.
