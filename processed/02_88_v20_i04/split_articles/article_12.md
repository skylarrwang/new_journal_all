sidered his status as a Lithuanian. If 
Lithuanian language and culture were 
unappreciated in the rest of the Soviet 
Union, they carried even less weight in 
most of America. Venclova also had to 
reconcile himself with the probability 
of never again seeing his mother, wife, 
and daughter. But, as painful as the 
possibility of exile seemed, he knew he 
would be imprisoned with 
other 
members of his group if he stayed. 
Friends convinced him to become the 
group's spokesman in the West. 
His family also supported the idea of 
leaving. "When my mother heard 
about my situation in Lithuania, she 
just 
told 
me that she perfectly 
understands me. She told me, 'Well, 
it's my fate - I married a revolu-
tionary, and I produce one. So it's just 
normal situation."' H e laughs warmly 
at the memory. 

Venclova left the Soviet Union on 
J anuary 25, 1977. He was alone and 
his English was "pretty shaky." He 
traveled first to Paris for three weeks, 
where he learned of the imprisonment 
of the head of the Lithuanian Helsinki 
Group, Viktor Petkas. He wrote a 
poem to his friend Petkas, 
who 
remains in internal exile in a Siberian 
village. 
Just before mid-July, Paris is empty. 
Not a single telephone responds 
or else it answers in another voice, 
informing you that since last year , the 
number 
has slightly changed . The eloquent tape 
does not wish to disclose the present 
cipher. 

By July of that year, every member of 
the Helsinki Groups in Moscow and 
Lithuania had been arrested. 

After arriving in Berkeley, Venclova 
used the American media to publicize 
his 
friends' situations. 
Americans 
listened to his remarks, but Moscow 
heard them as well. While at Berkeley, 
he received a letter from the Soviet 
Consulate in San Francisco informing 
him that his Soviet passport had been 
revoked, meaning that he could not 
return home to his family. Venclova 
had expected the letter, because he 
knew of this outcome in the cases of 
other dissidents. Stalin's daughter, 
Svetlana; and . the writer Alexander . 
Solzhenitsyn received letters Â· before 
him. Venclova's letter was the ninth. 
"We always joke that this is the most 
exclusive club in the world," he says 
proudly. He applied for political 
asylum, and eventually became an 
American citizen. Later, his wife and 
daughter were allowed to join him, 
although the couple has since divorced. 

Venclova spent several months at 
Berkeley, lecturing in Russian. 
Although the University seemed to 
him like "a real garden of paradise," his 
problems with English frustrated him. 
Venclova learned to read English by 
translating poetry, but understanding 
the spoken language continues to 
present challenges. "It is a problem for 
me, for example, in the criminal 
movies- quite often 
I 
cannot 
understand the plot, because people 
talk fast, and talk in slang. It's 
absolutely confusing for me," he says. 
He suggests that perfect mastery of 
English is impossible for someone who 
emigrates in middle age-"but 
Brodsky did it, his English is perfect. 
Of course, Brodsky is a genius." 

Venclova's comment reveals the self-
deprecating manner with which he 
describes himself in relation to his 
friends Brodsky and 
Milosz. 
He 
believes Brodsky "has made better use 
of his emigration," partly because 
Brodsky's ability to communicate with 
Americans exceeds his own. The fact 
that Czeslaw Milosz bothered to 
translate his poem, 
"Dialogue in 
Winter," made him "immensely 
proud," Venclova says, adding, "of 
course the translation is very much 
better than the original, I'm afraid." 

He also mentions his emigre friend 
Vasily Rudich, an assistant professor 
of Classics at Yale, saying that he 
admires Rudich's social ease and 
wishes he had more of this quality. 

Still, Venclova has been productive 
in the roie o( an emigre intellectual. 
Pursuing an American academ1c 
career, he left Berkeley for a teaching 
job at UCLA, and then in 1980 came 
to Yale at the invitation of Professor 
Victor Erlich of the Slavic Depart-
ment. Venclova became an assistant 
professor after completing his doctoral 
thesis, an intricate analysis of several 
Russian poets which is now on the 
shelves of Sterling. 

In both interpreting and creating 
poetry, 
V enclova 
focuses 
on the 
technical structure of the poem. In his 
own work, he generally adheres to 
standards of rhyming and strict 
metrical patterns. He gains a sense of 
the format of the future poem before 
anything else becomes clear. "Before 
beginning, I already know that it 
should be for example an eight-stanza 
poem, and I have this space to fill , just 
like a painter who has a canvas before 
him or her and has to fill in the colors," 
he explains. "And then several images 
start appearing to me, and then a few 
words, at different positions in the 
poem. And then I try to create the 
words or ideas that will connect these 

images." 

The language and shape of 
Venclova's poetry are decidedly 
Lithuanian, with an echo of Russian 
rhythm. 

Paradoxically, 
Venclova 
believes that leaving Lithuania has 
allowed him to preserve this style. He 
views his poetry as one way to preserve 
Lithuanian cultural identity, which has 
become fragile in a nation dominated 
by Russian language and culture. He 
compares the Soviet Union to 
America, explaining that both serve as 
melting pots for disparate cultures. 
"We have a melting pot in the United 
States that 
is 
pretty successful-
everybody melts in it, but people 
choose it. In the Soviet Union it 
is not their free choice to melt." 

Venclova, 
however, has hardly 
melted into an American mold. He 
says his poems, only about ten percent 
of which have been translated, do not 
read well in English. This does :not 
concern him, because his prirxiary 
audience reads his poetry in the 
original Lithuanian . 

Venclova's 
principal American audience is in 
C hicago, where the Lithuanian 
community numbers about 100,000. "I 
can read my poetry in Chicago, and 
300 people, 500 people will fill the 
room," he says. He also believes that 
his poetry and political essays find 
their way back to Lithuania through 
underground channels. But writing 
from exile, he says, quoting a Russian 
poet, is "a little like putting poetry in a 
bottle and throwmg it mto the ocean." 

Not to go home again-ever. 
To close up, disappear without a trace, 
Sink into autumn's fastness. To lose the 
things that are fated 
to be lost: whatever of former 
space still exists close at hand. 
And however sinful and shameful it seems, 
hearts continue to beat, 
and a siren's immaculate din wedges into 
the sullied night, 
this side of the current of Oresund
