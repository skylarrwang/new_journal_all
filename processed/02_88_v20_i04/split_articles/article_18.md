The Grounding of Modern Feminism

Nancy Cott's most recent book, The 
Grounding of Motkm Feminism, would 
perhaps be more appropriately titled 
The Groundings of Modern Feminisms, for 
in defending feminism's vitality, Cott 
stresses its diversity. 
While many 
historians identify the disunity of the 
post-suffrage era as a sign of fem-
inism's failure, Cott, 
professor of 
American 
history 
and chair of 
Women's Studies at Yale, locates in 
this disharmony modern feminism's. 
roots. Describing the period between 
1910 and 1930 as one of "crisis and 
28 The New Journal/February 5, 1988 
transition," Cott shows 
how the 
pervasive "decentralization and 
diversification, competition and even 
sectarianism" among women during 
those years not only informed but 
actually made possible the birth of a 
mass women's movement in the later 
twentieth century. 

The book concentrates on women's 
activities during the 1920's. For those 
unfamiliar with women's history of the 
early twentieth century, who have never 
heard of the Spiderweb Chart or are 
unaware that during the 1920's, 47% of 
undergraduates and 15.1% of Ph.D. 
candidates were women, the factual 
content of Cott's book is fascinating 
and easy to read. For those committed 
to the feminist cause, however, the 
book's 
optimism 
1s 
especially at-
.. 
tractive. From a conflict-ridden period 
of women's history, Cott manages to 
resurrect 
a 
coherent 
picture of 
feminism 
inspirational in effect if 
sometimes only wishful in fact. 

Cott begins by distinguishing the 
nineteenth century "woman move-
ment" from the more recent "women's 
movement," and then 
criticizes 
historians who 
attempt 
to apply 
retrospectively 
the language of 
feminism to the events of the earlY 
twentieth century. Disenfranchised 
and therefore 
politically 
voiceless, 
women at the turn of the century "were 
a distinct social 
class~" forced into 
cooperation by their common mute· 
ness. As the singular "woman" in the 
movement's title suggests, their 
"womanhood" alone easily defined 


their· individual and group identities: 
"rich and poor, socialist and capitalist, 
occasionally even black and white 
could 
be seen 
taking the same 
platform." 

Once women had attained the goal 
of suffrage · in 1920, however, they 
began to vocalize their different, even 
contradictory, views on significant 
social, economic, and political issues. 
Some women, for example, favored as-
sim ilation into the established 
bipartisan system, while others rallied 
for a separate "women's bloc." Some 
advocated the combination of career 
and 
marriage; 
others 
called 
the 
married woman wa.ge-earner "the 
enemy of society." Some supported the 
ERA; others defended gender-based 
labor legislation. After passage of the 
Nineteenth Amendment, paid mem-
bership in the National Woman's Party 
(NWP) declined from approximately 
50,000 in 1919 to a mere 151 in 1921, 
a sure sign of feminism's emerging 
aversion to single-issue politics. 

"I do not think women can be jofned 
together for any one purpose because 
the difference between the reactionary 
and the progressive is too great to be 
bridged," wrote Carrie Chapman Catt 
to a friend in 1927; however, ac-
cording to Nancy Cott, such rifts 
already existed at the turn of the 
century. Even during the fight for 
suffrage, Cott points out, disa-
greements between the Congressional 
Union (later the NWP) and the 
National American Woman Suffrage 
Association over methods could not be 
resolved: the NWP favored a militant 
federal campaign; the NA WSA pre-
fered 
an educative 
state-level 
approach. When in 1917 the NWP 
began to picket the White House, 
"outraged and disgusted with what 
they saw as absence of political sense as 
well as decorum in the NWP, [ mem-
bers of the NAWSAJ desperately 
hoped to quarantine their own public 
irnage from contamination." Cott not 
only documents the numerous post-
suffrage disputes, she also dispels the 
rnyth of unity in the suffrage move-
ment itself. 

R ather than mourn this apparent 
loss 
of solidarity, 
however, 
Cott 
reinterprets "the fracturing of the 
nineteenth century's singular woman" 
as "a success of the 
movement." 
Conflicts, she believes, are consistent 
with feminism since they enact the 
movement's two fundamental para-
doxes: 
Feminism asks for sexual equality 
that includes sexual difference. It 
aims for individual freedoms by 
mobilizing sex solidarity. It posits 
that women recognize their unity 
while it stands for diversity among 
women. 

Cott shows how as early as the 191O's 
tensions existed between "Human 
Feminists," or followers of Charlotte 
Perkins Gilman, and Ellen Key's 
"Female Feminists." The former 
emphasized similarities between all 
humans, the latter glorified woman's 
uniqueness. These differing opinions 
are both compatible with feminism 
since feminism recognizes diversity 
among women, and moreover, since 
the basis for women's differences 
reflect feminism's own ambivalence 
about the meaning of sexual equality. 
Women and men are of the same 
species though of different sexes, and, 
without denying gender, feminism 
demands an end to the stigmatization 
of this difference. According to Cott, 
disagreements among women have 
tended to 
reflect 
this essential 
doubleness of feminism's main tenets. 

Cott herself grapples with 
implicitly 
paradoxical nature of 
feminism as she tries to define the 
term. On the one hand, Cott calls for 
an ahistorical redefinition of feminism 
that comprehends 
nineteenth 
century woman and suffrage move-
ments and that embraces rather than 
avoids conflict. Opposition to sex 
hierarchy, 
belief that woman's 
condition is socially constructed, and 
recognition of women as a social 
grouping are, Cott contends, the three 
core components of any "feminist" 
perspective, regardless of historical 
context. At the same time, however, 
by positing the origin of modern 
feminism in the 1910's and its debut at 
the end of the suffrage movement, Cott 
locates the movement in a specific 
historical moment. Cott seems to want 
simultaneously to distinguish feminism 
from preceding movements and to 
assert the 
prevalence of modern 
feminist traces in those earlier times. 

This sort o f vacillation, though often 
confusing, is characteristic of gender-
based analyses of h istory and culture. 
Because 
social 
linguistic 
construct called "gender" happens to 
have a biological counterpart called 
"sex," woman's relation to her gender-
identity is necessarily complex. 
Feminist literary critics, for example, 
maintain incompatible notions of their 
own school of thought. While con-
A perhaps temporary 
diversion of women's 
attention from their 
"womanness" can be 
seen only as a victory. 
tending that feminist literary criticism 
invades and rethinks other critical 
schools, they also want to believe that 
their criticism is valid and useful on its 
own. Feminist literary theorists want 
both to combine with and to remain 
separate from 
traditional critical 
modes. T hey want to be Marxist-
Feminists, 
Freudian-Feminists and 
just plain Feminists; they want to 
assert the artificiality of gender and 
still believe that women have the 
potential for a language of their own. 

Thus, Cott's own ambivalence in this 
respect does not necessarily reflect a 
personal confusion but rather affirms 
the inherently paradoxical nature of a 
feminist project. 

Cott complicates her definition even 
further, however, when she attempts to 
justify the content of her 
book. 
Although she claims to have chosen 
only those women and organizations 
"who themselves claimed the name of 
The New JournaVFebruary 5, 1988 29 


'woman's cause' or feminism," many 
of the 
wom~n described reject 
feminism outright. For example, the 
professional women, attracted to the 
rationality and 
objectivity of the 
"learned" areas, tended to characterize 
their achievements as human, not 
female. Similarly, as feminism became 
increasingly associated with socialism 
and . lesbianism, women fighting for 
sexual 
liberation associated 
their 
efforts more with the social sciences 
than with feminism. By and large, 
Cott admits, 
" I n 
contrast to 
nineteenth-century women's small 
likelihood of distinction except in 
woman's rights or woman-oriented 
activities, twentieth century women 
stood out as individuals, for pursuits 
not obviously determined by sex nor 
undertaken for the advancement of 
their sex." Unfortunately, this growing 
individualism among active women 
often contradicts Cott's rationale for 
including them in her book. 

It is 
perha.ps more 
helpful 
to 
consider the content of Cott's book in 
light of the ambitiousness of her 
undertaking. 
In 
celebrating the 
heterogeneity of women Cott enters 
dangerous territory. She risks being 
either too broad, and thereby equating 
feminism with "what women did," or 
too narrow, and not accounting for all 
variation. 

The Grounding of Modem 
Feminism achieves an awkward balance 
between the two: it seems a little of 
both. Although in the first chapter, 
Cott mentions the three core com-
ponents of feminism, she never alludes 
to them again, and instead, the mere 
inclusion of an event seems to define it 
as feminist. In extolling the diversity of 
feminist women, Cott often obscures 
underlying similarities, and after seven 
chapters of conflict, one loses sight of 
the overarching unity. 

But while the book seems, at times, 
artificially comprehensive, Cott 
actually limits her discussion mainly to 
privileged women. In a book that 
professes to document heterogeneity 
among women and to endorse the 
development of various "feminisms," 
such a limitation seems inappropriate 
30 The New Journal/February 5, 1988 
if not irresponsible. Cott admits ·in the 
introduction that, "The woman's rights 
tradition was historically initiated by, 
and remains prejudiced toward, those 
who perceive themselves firc:t and 
foremost as 'woma.>1', who can gloss 
over their class, racial and other status 
identifications 
because 
those are 
culturally dominant and therefore 
relatively 
invisible." Instead of 
dismantling this racism and classism, 
however, her book recapitulates it. 

Black women are dropped from the 
book as quickly as they dropped out of 
the NWP after the 1921 convention. 
Although she devotes one section of 
one chapter to the differing attitudes of 
working class and educated women 
toward having a career, this chapter, 
more than any other, stresses the 
similarities over the differences of 
women in conflict. 

Cott concludes, "Without coalescing 
i n to one movement, 
without 
mobilizing the mass, 
and often 
declining the label feminist, individual 
and group efforts nonetheless sparked 
again and again." By the end of the 
book it seems that the only workable 
definition 
of "feminism" 
is 
its 
paradoxical nature or essential 
doubleness. 

T he definition Cott 
initially proposes for early feminism 
Conflicts, she believes, 
are consistent with 
feminism. 
befits her conception of modern 
feminism as well. "What distinguished 
the feminism of the 1910's," Cott 
insists, "was its very multifaceted 
constitution, the fact that its several 
strands were all loudly voiced and 
mutally recognized as part of the same 
phenomenon of female avant-garde 
self-assertion. None of its single tenets 
was brand new ... [only] that potential 
to encompass opposites." 

On the one hand, such a definition 
compromises an immediate sense of 
unity within feminism. On the other 
hand, a perhaps temporary diversion 
of women's attention 
from 
"womanness" can be seen only as a 
victory for a movement aimed to 
invent a "human sex." Moreover, if as 
Cott indicates, 
our culture 
has 
traditionally asserted the similarity 
between all women and registered 
gender difference hierarchically, the 
. recognition that diversity exists among 
women, as among men, is certainly an 
achievement. Women, though of the 
same sex, 
differ 
racially, 
socio-
economically, 
politically, 
as 
human beings. 

In the last paragraph of the book, 
briefly 
alludes 
revocali-zation of feminism in the 
1960's and 1970's when, she claims, 
women began to speak again in terms 
of unity- now derived not from their 
"womanhood" as in the nineteenth 
century, but from their experience as 
members of a "sex-class." The modern 
women's movement is, she contends, a 
culmination of several decades of 
diversification and proves that 
plurality need not preclude trans-
cendent solidarity. Thus The Grounding 
of Modem F"eminism, much like Cott's 
previous The Bonds of Womanhood, is 
ultimately an optimistic book not only 
because it favorably reinterprets a 
chaotic period of women's history, but 
also because by so doing, it inspires a 
sense of solidarity, purpose, and hope 
for the women's movement now and in 
the future.
