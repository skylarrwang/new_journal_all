Television is a recurring theme in 
Paul Rutkovsky's work. As a video ar-
tist, he has created a number of unusual 
tapes, 
including one which 
was 
presented at a 
Silliman Sheep's 
Clothing concert a few years back, a 
piece entitled "How to Draw." In the 
videotape, 
Rutkovsky appears and 
shows the viewer how to draw various 
objects (such as a sink, cat, etc.,) and 
finally, shows a ftlmed demonstration of 
each object in use. The last lesson 
demonstrates the drawing of a gun, and 
the video protagonist is assassinated. 
End of lesson. One reason why Rutkov-
sky's work is so accessible to those "un-
trained" in art, and appreciated by those 
who might normally reject it out-of-
hand, is that no abstraction is carried 
beyond everyday life. If it can be 
translated into television terms, it can 
be understood by any modern person. 


Needless to say, there are strong 
political overtones to Rutkovsky's art. 
However, there is no ideology involved 
in its presentation, no preaching. He 
says his creations simply 
reflect 
militaristic attitudes rampant in today's 
world. 


A show upcoming in Los 
Angeles, opening on November 14 at 
Contemporary Exhibitions, is called 
"Airplane Remnants," and consists of a 
Korean War bomber control panel, 
whose switches are operated by Rutkov-
sky. Portable tape players and hanging 
lights are placed at different points in 
the gallery, scattered among wings, 
stewardesses, cockpits, pilots, wheels, 
bullets, tailfins, and missiles. Rutkov-
sky operates the lighting and sound 
selections at whim; sounds include 
recordings of an atomic bomb explo-
sion, bullets, and machine guns. The 
audience wanders about the gallery, 
Paul RuJlwvslcy insidL 1M Pap" Mtu:hi VidLo lnstituÂ« 
viewing the changes through plastic 
opera glasses and filling out order forms 
for their favorite airplane remnants. 


The message behind the art, in this 
case, is gleaned through direct par-
ticipation. 


Participation is what an evening at a 
Papier Mache Video Institute opening 
is all about. At any given moment, you, 
the viewer, might be drafted to xerox 
your face in slow motion or assist in the 
photography of a seltzer bottle being 
shot at a live electrical wire. Artists are 
always willing to discuss their work, and 
the physical layout of the Institute is 
intriguing, at times a bit confusing, 
because the walls are moved periodical-
ly. The surrealistic surroundings of a 
totally industrialized neighborhood of-
fer a vista refreshingly unlike Yale's 
ivory towers. 


Although the Papier Mache Video 
Institute is held together largely by Paul 
Rutkovsky's imagination and a little 
rubber cement, it is the home of 
numerous exhibits and performances 
created by other artists, whose interest 
range from the mildly avant-garde to 
the wildly incomprehensible. Sound 
sculptures, painting displays, video anr! 
fLlm projection and performance pieces 
are all part of the Institute's calendar. 


New York's Carmen Beuchat per-
formed two evenings of modern dance 
on October 16 and 1 7. Her perfor-
mances, according to Paul Rutkovsky, 
"include works that combine pure dance 
with mixed media modes that are both 
mysterious and exhtlarating."
