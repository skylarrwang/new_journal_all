**Testing Teachers: A New System Ahead?**
**Author: Welter Jeeob**
**Page number(s): 8-9**

If you're a student with ecstatic praise or 
harsh criticism for your professor, you 
might take your views to Dean Lamar. 
If you're like most students, however, 
you'll never have a chance to let the Ad-
ministration hear how you feel about 
the Yale faculty. The comments you 
write on your course improvement 
forms each semester will go no farther 
than your professor. The opinions you 
pass on to the Course Cn'tique won't be 
used when teachers come up for depart-
mental evaluation. 

The fact is that no mechanism now 
exists by which students can have a say 
in faculty promotions and tenure deci-
sions. 
Nor has any standardized 
method been established by the ad-
ministration for the evaluation of 
teaching. 

AU that may change soon. Although 
the Yale faculty has shown strong signs 
of opposition, 
two administration-
appointed committees and members of 
the Yale College Council (YCC) are 
considering a comprehensive teacher 
evaluation system based on mandatory 
student evaluation forms. 

"We're definitely in support of having 
more student input into the whole • 
decision-making process: said Beth 
Pardo, a Morse College representative 
to the YCC.


The option•

Last year the Committee on Faculty 
Appointments took a close look at 
teacher evaluation systems at other 
schools, sources say. The committee, 
chaired by Professor James Tobin, was 
.;set up to look at Yale's policy towards 
tenure and non-tenure appointments. 
Professor Robert Apfel, former chair-
man of the Teaching and Learning 
Committee, said he gave the Tobin 
Committee the results of his own 
research into teacher evaluations at 
Princeton and Stanford. 

Horace Taft, this years chairman of 
the Teaching and Learning Committee, 
said he is interested in a number of 
teacher evaluation options and wiU put 
the idea before his committee if the 
Tobin Committee does not address the 
issue in its October report. A majority 
of Teaching and Learning Committee 
members said they favor discussion of 
the issue. 

Yale's present Course Improvement 
Form System, approved last April by 
Yale College faculty, 
was 
recommended by Apfel's committee. 
Students, under the rules of the system, 
suggest improvements to their profes-
sors at the end of each semester, but no 
faculty member is required to pass out 
the course improvement forms and 
• nobody besides the professor himself 
gets to see them once they are filled out. 

Princeton's system, in contrast to 
Yale's approach, makes student opinion 
of professors a matter of public record. 
Approved under student pressure in 
1968-9, the Princeton system requires 
all professors and teaching assistants to 
pass out two evaluation forms to their 
students, a multiple choice answer sheet 
and a sheet for written comments. The 
comment sheet, which asks for sugges-
tions on course improvement, is kept by 
the professor. The multiple-choice sheet 
is sent to the Educational Testing Ser-
vice, the same company that prints and 
grades College Entrance Examinations. 
The tabulated results then go to depart-
ment chairmen, administrators and the 
professors themselves, and are put on 
display at the Registrar's and Dean's of-
fices for all interested students to see. 

Princeton Registrar Bruce Finnie said 
many students use the result in making 
course decisions. Administrators and 
department heads use student opinions 
in making promotion decisions and set-
ting salary levels for faculty members. 
Finnie sees nothing wrong with using 
~ student input to evaluate all faculty, 
tenured and non-tenured. 
'The Princeton system was designed 
to be a multi-purpose instrument," he 
said. "On what grounds would you ex-
clude any faculty from the process?" 

Yet many other options remain open 
to Yale committees in search of a viable 
teacher evaluation system. At Stanford 
University, professors are not required 
to pass out evaluation forms, but must 
tell the Registrar if they don't. Students 
do not see the results of the polls, nor 
are they used to set pay scales, but they 
do figure in promotion and tenure deci-
sions, according to Jim Coleman, Stan-
ford's Academic Standing Advisor. 

At the Yale Medical School, where 
students receive no grades, faculty and 
students achieve a balance of power by 
evaluating each other. While teacher 
evaluations are discussed when pro-
fessors are bucking for promotion, 
students know their evaluations wiU 
come up when they apply for jobs. 

Stiff oppoeltlon 

If the administration proposes a system 
like Princeton's to the faculty, howev~r, 
it is likely to encounter stiff opposition. 
Apfel said he scouted out faculty reac-
tions towards a Princeton-styled system 
before his committee proposed the 
Course Improvement Form to the facul-
ty. On the basis of interviews with 16 
department chairmen and directors of 
undergraduate studies, Apfel decided 
Princeton's form wouldn't fly at Yale. 

"They all sort of grimaced at the 
evaluation form and said they didn't 
think it would have much appeal," he 
said. 

Many administrators and faculty 
wear the same grimaces today. Dean 
Lamar predicated a strong faculty veto 
if the issue ever comes up. 
•1 think they feel that they themselves 
are so concerned about teaching that 
they don't need such an elaborate 
mechanical device," he said. 

Lamar added that a faculty veto 
would be sufficient to kill the proposal, 
at least for this year. 
*I think a vote by the faculty deter-
mines it one way or the other," he said. 

Apfel agreed, but took a different 
view towards faculty motives. 
*It's not so clear that the faculty are 
disinterested commentators on that 
issue," he said. 

What'• •t etake 

Professor Bradford Westerfield, who 
served with Apfel on the Teaching and 
Learning Committee in 1980, said 
there was little confusion back then as to 
what bothered the faculty about a 
teacher evaluation system. 

"What the faculty opposed .. he wd, 
•was any hint that the forms would be 
seen by anyone but the professor him or 
herself." 

What was at stake in 1980, faculty 
and administrators suggest, is still the 
main issue today; the use of student 
evaluations in salary and promotion 
decisions could pose a threat to faculty 
wages and positions. But because the 
Tobin Committee is unlikely to recom-
mend that student opinions be used in 
wage decisions, Apfel said, tenured pro-
fessors would find that their jobs are not 
threatened under a teacher evaluation 
system. Junior faculty, on the other 
hand, would be placed under a new 
kind of pressure from the students. 

Dean Lamar said the faculty would be 
very sensitive about working in such 
conditions. 

"The faculty here has always been 
very touchy about what seems to be a 
coercive system of reporting," he said. 

Taft said he was not sure that pro-
fessors who felt they had to please their 
students would become better teachers. 

"It's not at all clear what that is, 
whether that is good teaching or not," 
he said. But caught between the desire 
to provide good teaching and the need 
to produce quality work, Apfel sug-
gested, many junior faculty members 
will look out for number one. 

"It's Catch-22 situation for some 
junior faculty 
members," he said. 
"Often, it comes down to 'what's going 
to do me the most good?"' 

Convenient apathy 

Whether or not any teacher evaluation 
system can pass a faculty vote may ride 
heavily on how responsible teachers 
think students will be with their new 
power. YCC Chairman Paul Bacdayan 
said even he is not sure students can be 
trusted to fill out evaluation forms 
responsibly. "I would hope that they 
would," he said "but I think it's easy for 
students to not write a very well 
thought-out essay." Westerfield said his 
own experience with Course Improve-
ment forms was not encouraging. 

"For two years in a row fve given out 
the forms in my class with a big pitch, 
and both years f ve gotten back 10 per-
cent of the class," he said. "That's a stan-
dard figure. • 

Such response rates go a long way 
towards explaining the faculty's cool 
response towards an evaluation system, 
Westerfield suggested. 

"If you really had a sense that the 
students as a whole really wanted to 
make poUing a serious thing, then the 
faculty would take it seriously as well," 
he said. 

But Apfel's research shows that what
