Company (SNETCO) with only basic 
typing skills make between $4.45 and 
$8.41 an hour. 

What's 
more, Yale service and 
maintenance people, the blue collar 
workers which include the dining hall 
and Physical Plant employees, make 
more 
than 
their white collar 
counterparts. T he lowest paid service 
and maintenance people at Yale, which 
include waitresses, waiters, light custo-
dians and elevator operators make 
$6.10 an hour. In addition, they receive 
four cost of living increases a year, 
which last year totaled $.58 an hour, or 
$23.00 a week. White collar workers 
don't receive an automatic cost of living 
increase in pay, although the University 
periodically raises their salaries. The 
most recent revision, which went into 
effect on July 1, 1981, amounted to an 
11 to 12 percent increase over the last 
salary revision in September of 1980. 
But these figures have not sent people 
running to the unions. A number of 
factors have complicated, and continue 
to complicate, the union organizer's 
task. 

"The nature of the employees, the 
size of the campus, the fact that you're 
dealing with a 
different class 
background than you normally deal 
with in blue-collar situations" all make 
clerical and technical organizing dif-
ficult, according to Charlene Block. 
The banner of white collar workers in-
cludes everything from lab technicians 
and computer programmers to librar-
ians and secretaries, all of whom come 
with attitudes and concerns as diverse 
as the skills they use. The organizers 
must not only communicate with this 
large group of employees, spread out 
from laboratories on Science Hill to 
phone stations and offices at Yale-New 
Haven Hospital, but also unite them 
behind a common set of grievances or 
principles. 

Another factor which has hindered 
the unions, Block says, is that their 
backgrounds are different from those of 
workers who are traditionally associated 
with unions. 

"Their whole philosophy about a 
union through their upbringing has 
been different" from that of blue collar 
workers, Block said. 

"Maybe their dads own businesses." 
Furthermore, some white collar 
employees have strong ties of loyalty 
with Yale. They are less inclined to 
form a 
coalition with an outside 
organization 
that 
might hurt the 
University or send them out on strike 
against it. In 1968, shortly after the ftrSt 
drive to unionize clerical and technical 
employees began, Henry Chauncey, 
then Special Assistant to the President 
of the University, made a candid com-
ment which shed much light on the rela-
tionship white collar workers have with 
the University. 

"Of the twelve workers I have talked 
to-" Chauncey told the Yale Daily 
News, "and I don't call them workers, I 
call them friends- not one thinks that 
they need a union." 

This personal rapport which the 
clericals and technicals have with 
management help the University re-
main in good standing with them, 
regardless of working conditions 
Because this same rapport is con-
spicuously missing between the service 
and maintenance people and manage-
ment, they can turn much more easily 
to a union to redress their discrepancies 
in pay than the white collar workers 
can. 

Because workers' perceptions are far 
more important than the reality of 
working conditions, the negative 
perceptions that many white collar 
workers have of unions have kept them 
from voting in favor of joining a union. 
If a union aucceaafully 
organized the clerical 
and technical employ .. a, 
It would control the 
largeat group of 
employ .. 
a on campua. 

"We have great serv1ces that we offer 
to (white collar workers] above and 
beyond just being a part of the UAW," 
Block said. 

"But I think there's been some misap-
prehension from the people as to 
whether they need to address these 
problems with a union because people 
consider that a union is an abstract 
thing, another party coming in trying to 
make abstract decisions for them." 

"What fve seen of the Unions has led 
me to distrust them,• one secretary 
commented. 

"They told us we'd get a 70 percent 
raise last time. 
That's ridiculous," 
another added. 

"There's nothing (the unions] can 
give me that I don't already have,• in 
the university job. 
While Wilhelm may point proudly to 
the things Local 35 has accomplished in 
the last decade, few white collar workers 
have forgotten that these sweeping 
changes came only after a series of bit-
terly contested and controversial 
walkouts. Local 35's first strike in 1968 
lasted only one day. But in 1971, when 
their contract expired, they went •on 
strike" for seven weeks; in 1974, for ten. 
Their most recent strike in 1977 lasted 
for thirteen weeks, leaving dining halls 
closed well into December of Fall Term 
1977, and workers without a job or 
regular salary ~ughout that period. 

However controversial these strikes 
were at the time for the blue collar 
workers, they accomplished, in the 
words of John Wilhelm, "everything, 
and I mean that quite literally." In 
1968, blue collar workers made scarcely 
above the minimum wage. In 1980, 
they are among the highest paid dining 
hall workers in the country. 

But for white collar workers, the ends 
required to bring these changes about 
don't necessarily justify the means. 

"If you look at the history of relation-
ships between the University and Local 
35, I think that very few clerical and 
technical employees would like to ex-
perience that," Jerald Stevens, Vice-
President of the University, 
who 
oversees the nuts and bolts of the 
University operations, said. 

Another factor has complicated the 
union drives: for the first time, the 
white collar workers are being courted 
by more than one union. 

Block and her co-workers say they .. 
might me for an election with the 
NLRB some time this spring, one year 
later than they said it would be last fall. 

"It depends on how many people are 
confused by the fact that two unions are 
fighting over them and how many peo-
ple that conflict turns off to unions 
altogether," Block said. 

At that time, the UAW was the only 
union with an ongoing clerical and 
technical drive. Then Wilhelm and 
Local 35 threw their hat into the ring 
and started a competing drive last 
November. 

"I don't happen to think that having 
more than one union involved is bad. I 
think that to the extent that people have 
a chance to make choices and to see how 
different unions function, that's fme," 
Wilhelm said. 

Neither Wilhelm's opinion nor his 
subsequent actions sit well with the 
UAW. 

"If the 'other union' had not jumped 
into the drive, we would have had an 
election by now," Block said. 

Now Local35 and the UAW are try-
ing to address these issues but their tac-
tical approaches differ.

effectively communicate what the union is 
all about to all of those little pockets of 
people that are all over the campus," 

Local 35's drive is trying to do just 
that. They have attempted to set up a 
"rank and ftle organizing committee," of 
500 to 525 people with at least one per-
son in every individuaJ office or depart-
ment. To date, they have passed out on-
ly one brochure, relying rather on this 
extensive grapevine to take their cause 
to the blue collar workers themselves. 

The United Auto Workers has pur-
sued a different tactic throughout their 
drive than Local35 has. Since 1979, the 
UAW has passed out countless pam-
phlets, booklets, leaflets and brochures. 
They have set up booths, worn signs 
and held large publicized meetings. The 
goal of this work is to lead a very visible 
and public campaign rather than estab-
lishing an internal network like local 35 
is trying to do. Similarly, they have fli-
ed two unfair labor practices against the 
University with the NLRB, one involv-
ing a Peter Halsey, Director of Com-
munity Relations at Yale, quotation in 
the New Havm 
R~gistn', and another 
involving an employee 
who was 
harrassed by h::r supervisor for passing 
out union leaflets. 

But this style of organizing evokes the 
' UAWs heritage of industrial organiza-
tion and the hard-fought battles of 
former days. In a booklet called the 
UAW fact finder, an unsigned letter to 
TNJ/RoUin Rogga 
local union representatives maintains 
that "those older members to whom the 
past struggles are but dim memories 
need to be reminded by their leaders 
that no benefit is guaranteed unless we 
have strong, 
militant and united 
members who give their leaders all-out 
support." Another pamphlet holds that 
"beauty, culture and prestige don't pay 
the rent [or] put food on the table." At 
last spring's Communiversity Day, 
some of the employees who have joined 
forces with the UA W carried signs 
which read "We're only a pawn in their 
game." 

But the University itself can offer ser-
vices to the clerical and technicals too, 
and if they wish to keep the unions out, 
they will need to demonstrate to white 
collar workers that the University's in-
tentions and working conditions are 
good. Because the employees work for 
the University, and not for the unions, 
the University can improve working 
conditions in 
a 
way 
union 
organizers can only promise to do. 

"'ur position has always been that 
generally Yale and the employees who 
are being organized would not neces-
sarily benefit" from a white collar 
union, Vice President Stevens said. 

And in the last year and a half, the Ad-
ministration has embarked on an im-
proved worker training program, set up 
a counseling and preliminary grievance 
committee network of"personnel repre-
sentatives," and begun a "new evalua-
tion system fm· managenal and profes-
sional workers that has as its basic prin-
ciple that there ought to be more ex-
plicit and formal statements of what we 
expect people ought to do," according to 
the Vice-President. At the same time 
Stevens said the · University has ~ 
"ongoing effort" to keep salaries marked 
to market so that we are meeting com-
petition." 

In short, the University has found, 
like many other management fLnlls in 
the 1980s, that the way to keep unions 
out is to be a good employer. "We ought 
to take the kind of corrective actions 
that make sure that people don't see 
unions as their only redress alternative," 
Stevens said. 

Still, because the University under-
stands the size of the stakes involved 
and the potential of a white collar union 
to cause them financial and other 
headaches, they are taking no chances. 

Yale has retained a H artford-based law 
firm, Seigal, O'Conner and Kanin, to 
advise them on "labor-related matters," 
according to Stevens. 

But the union organizers do not feel 
that Seigal, O'Conner and Kanin play 
such an impartial role. Block maintains 
that while the University calls them 
"labor consultants, we refer to them, 
lovingly, as union busters." 

Despite the difficulties involved, the 
union organizers remain optimistic 
about their chances of having an elec-
tion soon. "Conditions have deterior-
ated to the point where there's no ques-
tion that they'IJ form a union in the next 
couple of years," Wilhelm said. "I don't 
know what the precise timetable will be, 
but I feel confident there will be an elec-
tion before june," or during this school 
year. 

The United Auto Workers also hope 
to file for an election at that time. "All 
Universities that we've organized take 
two or three years," Block said. "And 
most of them don't have other unions," 
competing with them. 

"The campaign between the unions 
has not been easy, but neither one of us 
has begun the campaign against the 
University," she added. 

But the Administration is not certain 
it will face this situation so soon. "I 
think the unions are going to have a 
damn difficult job organizing,- Jerry 
Stevens said. "And I don't think they're 
~oing to be successful."
