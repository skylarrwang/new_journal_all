soft muscle tissue were judged to have 
about tree day's worth of anti-metabolic 
reserves for protection. Before the 
MTX got a chance to attack the bone 
marrow, the patient would get a shot ot 
CPDG 1 to destroy most of the MTX in 
his bloodstream and "rescue" him from 
a grisly death. 

Unfortunately, an injection of 
CPDG1, directly into the bloodstream 
would have serious side-effects. The 
body's immunological defense system is 
so acute that it attacks foreign proteins 
like CPDG1 as soon as they enter the 
bloodstream. The amount of CPDG1 
necessary to eliminate most of the 
MTX could well send the body into 
anafolactic shock. In other words, by 
trying to produce antibodies to attack 
the enzyme the body would soon ex-
haust its own defense system. The treat-
ment for leukemia was thus becoming 
an extended chain of cures and counter-
cures, each one almost as lethal as the 
original disease. 

The breakthrough came with Hor-
vath and Kalghatgi's research in 
biochemical engineering. In the early 
1970s Horvath began developing a 
device known as an •enzyme reactor" 
that would permit doctors to use 
CPDG1 in a new kind of rescue opera-
tion. Horvath's idea was to force a reac-
tion between CPDGt and MTX out-
side of all contact with the bloodstream. 
The reactor, an unimpressive-
looking plastic cylinder about 8 inches 
long and two inches in diameter and 
packed with hair-like tubules, works 
much like an artificial kidney. Large 
quantities of blood are pumped out of 
the body and filtered through hairlike 
tubules that run the length of a reactor. 
Stored within the tubules is enough 
CPDG 1 to break down a lethal dose of 
MTX. As blood containing MTX is 
fJ.ltered through the tubules, the MTX 
enters the tubule wall and is broken 
down by CPDG 1 into harmless acids. 
The purified blood is then pumped back 
into the body. 

The beauty of the Horvath reactor is 
that CPDG1 never enters the body, and 
thus never causes a reaction from the 
body's immunological system. The 
reactor can safely eliminate in the space 
of two hours over 90 percent of the 
MTX in the bloodstream. 

Despite the advantages of Horvath's 
reactor, it is still a long way from being 
used on human beings. Like any other 
tool in cancer therapy, it must first be 
tested on laboratory animals. Bertino 
said he is frustrated by the strict testing 
requirements set for cancer treatments. 
"'n my view," he said, •the re-
quirements of doing testing on anti-
cancer drugs are much too stringent." 

Partly because of these rigid re-
quirements, neither Bertino nor Hor-
vath is eager to commit himself to a date 
on which the reactors will be ready for 
use. 

"'t will probably take at least a year 
before we have enough ·data . . . to 
allow for work on humans," Bertino 
said. Horvath hopes the reactor will 
follow the path of another enzyme reac-
tor he built to combat PKU, a disease 
causing mental retardation in children. 
That device is slated for use on human 
beings later this year. 

For the moment, however, progress 
is gradual and equipment is expensive. 
Both Horvath and Bertino worry about 
their sources of research funds. 

Bertino, who gets his funding from 
the National Cancer Institute, said 
many scientists are suffering the same 
anxieties. 

"I think everyone believes, and I 
believe, too, that it's going to get more 
difficult to get funding," he said. 

Horvath, who said his funds come 
from the National Institute of Health, 
fears that even a constant flow of 
research dollars may not pay for his 
work. 

"The problem seems to be that while 
grants may remain the same size, the 
inflation eats up a lot, • he said. 

Horvath also worries that any sudden 
brake in the money flow, even if it is 
later resumed, would cause a serious 
set-back, to his research. 

Horvath, Bertino and Kalghatgi are 
all concerned about the supply of 
CPDG 1. Presently, the enzyme is being 
produced by a New England manufac-
turer. The production of such a small 
quantity of enzyme is extremely expen-
sive, and that expense is passed on to 
the researchers themselves. Horvath 
has suggested that Yale should invest in 
the facilities necessary for enzyme pro-
duction, both to provide more security 
for projects like his own and to instruct 
graduates and undergraduates in Bio-
technology. 

For Horvath, the enzyme reactor fits 
neatly into a much greater long-term 
plan. That is to bring the benefits of 
chemical engineering to medicine. 

"The pure scientist is an egoist," he 
said, "concerned only with the pleasures 
of knowing." 

It remains for the engineer to bring 
that knowledge to· society. Horvath cites 
an old cliche, "The scientist makes it 
known, the engineer makes it work." 

Both Bertino and Horvath feel in-
tense pressure to •make it work." If the 
CPDG1 reactor works well, then work 
will begin to improve upon it, or to 
build new reactors working with new 
enzymes. As Horvath puts it, "a suc-
cessful project never ends, it just keeps 
growing."
