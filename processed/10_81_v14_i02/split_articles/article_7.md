EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The prisoners right arm was suspended 
in the air because of the bullet wound. 

A few weeks before he would have been 
released from the halfway house, he 
went beserk and held nine people hos-
tage. He shot a girl. The police shot 
him. Now he was lying in a bed in Yale 
New Haven Hospital moaning. Some 
cop was sitting in the darkened hall 
watching him. 

The cop was Rick Randall- a 29 
year-old black police officer with three 
years on the job. Randall asked one of 
the nurses for some lined paper. She 
gave him a blank medical form. On the 
back of the paper, he wrote: 
Slowly I reap the fragments 
Of yesterday's dreams 
Merely left behind 
To remind me 
Of more optimistic time 
I guess it really doesn't matter 
If a dream 
Is ever harvested 
For rm a prisoner 
Of today's pessimistic reality. 

Officer Randall also writes songs. 
You might see him sometime playing-
the piano in the Jonathan Edwards 
common room. He'll be the clean-cut, 
baby-faced guy with the fine features, 
the slender fmgers, smooth voice. He'll 
probably be playing one of his own 
compositions smiling, 
glowing. 
It's 
possible you'll 
feel 
inspired just 

Randall is a lifelong New Havener. 
He grew up in rundown sections of 
town that have long since been tom 
down and done over. He was 17 when 
he attended the May Day Rally on the 
Green. Today, he lives in a handsome 
redbrick building on Dwight Street with 
two Siberian huskies, Lazarus and 
Loki, the latter named after the Norse 
god of mischief. 

Randall has had few encounters with 
Yalies, but last year he took two by sur-
prise. They had been mugged and were 
waiting for an officer to make a report. 
Randall was guarding a prisoner. One 
of the Yalies asked Randall why he 
seemed to be the only one around who 
was in a good mood. 
'"It doesn't make a difference if 
everything's happening or not happen-
ing. You mothers will stay in a good 
mood," he said. 
"You ever heard of existentialism? 
l Well, you must be an existentialist if 
you're going to be here." 

A short discussion of existentialism 
ensued. One of the Yalies asked if most 
cops thought that way. 
"rm not most cops," Randall said. 
"rmme." 

One of the Yalies recollected long 
afterward, "'t's not like he was the only 
competent person there. It was just a 
different attitude and a different age." 

Qrowln• up
Randall grew up in the slums of the 
Dwight and Dixwell areas of New 
Haven. He said his neighbors included 
a drug pusher on one side, and a lady 
who ran a numbers operation on the 
other. His father, a chef, divorced his 
mother when he was ten. For the next 
ten years, his mother supported six 
children by cleaning apartments. 
Sometimes she went on welfare. 

On weekends and over the summer, 
Randall visited his grandparents' home 
in Milford. "I was given suburbia lock, 
stock, and barrel," Randall said. "I was 
able to sort of balance my two worlds. 
"The asset to it was realizing that 
there was an out. There was something 
other than Dixwell. There was some-
thing other than the pushers on the 
street." 

Randall never had any trouble with 
the law. When riots broke out in Lee 
High School, he and a friend decided to 
spend the day in the Yale Art Gallery. 
Many of those who knew him were sur-
prised that he became a cop only 
because they thought he was going to be 
a lawyer. 

While in high school, Randall took 
classes on the Yale campus through the 
U.S. Grant program. After graduation, 
he decided he was sick of school. He 
worked in a department store and spent 
five years as an aide in Yale-New 
Haven Hospital. One day, coming 
home from work at a drug store, he saw 
the police recruiting van and decided to 
go for it. 
"I just thought I could do a better job 
than half the cops I met," he said. "I 
thought I could understand people bet-
ter." 

Although Randall questioned some 
of the police civil rights practices in the 
'sixties, he had never been anti-law. He 
made a distinction between being anti-
war and supporting the Panthers or 
hating the police. Nonetheless, Randall 
said, '1 still have my reservations about 
the police." 

He understands some things better 
now. For example, the reason why New 
Haven cops frequently stop black 
youths. A crime will be committed 
somewhere in the vicinity, and the 
youth will fit the general description, 
Randall said. 
"Now· you say, 'what's the matter, 
you stop every black kid running in a 
blue shirt and jeans?' That's as a kid. 
But the cop has to say, 'Well if I don't 
stop him, what happens if he's the per-
son?'" 

Randall has been stopped by police 
several times in his life. He admits 
white people get stopped far less fre-
quently, but says that doesn't par-
ticularly bother him. One thing does 
frustrate him: 
"If a white person's giving me a 
description and he says, 'he [the 
criminal] was black,' I say, 'well what 
complexion was he?' 'He was black.' 
'OK was he medium complected? Was 
he dark complected?' 'He was bU:uk.l' 
When you're dealing with that kind of 
mentality you sort of understand why a 
lot of people get stopped, because you're 
dealing with very skimpy character-
istics." 

About a year ago, Randall was walk-
ing down Chapel Street wearing a 
brown cowboy hat. An officer stopped 
him and asked him if he would wait a 
minute. 
"Sure Jack," Randall said. 
The officer looked up: "0 Shit." 
Another officer approached: "Does 
the kid check out?" 
"It's Randall, Lieutenant." 

The pl•nom•n
Something about Rick Randall's man-
ner makes him seem like a person on 
the verge of being discovered. It's partly 
his poise but it's also the bemused, laid-
back way he choses to deal with the 
world. When he's confused, he writes 
poems; "Sometimes it's a way to make 
sure I stay true to who I am." When he's 
frustrated, he takes photographs or 
plays the piano. 

Randall's played all kinds of music. 
As a child, he practiced classical music 
at his grandparents' house in Milford. 
In high school, he sang for a local rock 
group called Fortified Glue. He also 
worked as the pianoman at the Enor-
mous Room which used to be above the 
Gypsy Bar on York Street. 
'1 never liked performing," he said. "I 
didn't like the demands people put on 
you . Like they owned you." He en-
counters some of the same thing when 
he's out on patrol and some motorist ex-
pects him to jump his car, or some 
pedestrian expects him to provide a lift 
to the train station. 

Randall's artistic work reveals natural 
talent. Most of his songs have a mellow 
sound; it's like opening up a music box 
and hearing Cat Stevens. His poems 
are simple and sincere; he says all 
poetry should be easily accessible, free 
of any difficult metaphors or allusions 
that get in your way.

Hla nelghbora Included a 
drug puaher on one aide 
and a lady who ran a 
numbera operation on the 
other. 

Color photography is another of his 
interests. 
He has early morning 
cityscapes, abstract shots of colored 
lights, and a series on seals. He took 
one picture of a frost pattern taken 
through the windshield of his car as 
another car was passing by. He took 
another of a butterfly and a bee sitting 
on a flower. "I ran around trying to 
catch those butterflies and bees with a 
regular lens," he said. 

On P•trol
Like other officers with only a few years 
on the job, Randall fills in when they 
need someone to patrol in a car, but he 
doesn't have a regular beat. Often he 
spends his time answering complaints 
on the telephone or xeroxing reports in 
Records. 

He probably would have been an-
swering phones on Friday, October 2, 
but some writer called the chief and said 
he wanted to ride with Randall. On 
what proved to be a fairly typical night, 
Randall dealt with some perennial 
problems- car accidents, disorderly 
conduct, disturbing the peace. 

About halfway through his shift, 
Randall assisted on a strange accident 
case. A drunk was driving down the 
street. Someone rammed into him and 
apparently beat him up. The problem 
was that the drunk couldn't remember a 
thing. He couldn't even confirm that 
someone had run into him. To com-
plicate matters, the drunk bad lost his 
keys. The officers decided to tow away 
the car because they figured the drunk 
wouldn't remember where be had left it. 

The thing about patrolling is that you 
can't ever relax, Randall said. You 
come across some silly, petty things, but 
you never know when something is go-
ing to happen. Randall remembers the 
time he was first one to arrive on the 
scene of a shooting. A guy was sitting in 
a van; he had been shot in the head. 

After handling that incident, Randall 
had to go to someone's home and ask 
them to tum down their music. "That's 
the way life is," Randall said. "Life 
doesn't give a damn; it just goes." 

While cru1smg on one of the 
sidestreets along Grand Avenue, Ran-
dall came upon a group of teenagers in 
dungaree jackets. One of the guys was 
shuffiing a deck of cards. Some girls 
were sitting on the hood of a car. 
"Hey officer, Howya doin?" 
"Lousy," Randall said smiling, "How 
about you?" 
"You get any complaints officer? You 
want us to leave?" 

Randall asked if they had been mak-
ing trouble. They said they hadn't. 
Randall suggested that they leave 
anyway. 

Later that night, Randall was called 
to back up another unit. Two officers 
were having trouble getting a short, 
stout woman into the back of the deten-
tion van. 
"Monica," one of the officers said. "I 
thought you said you were going to be 
good." 
"I can't. I can't," she said. 
"Now come on Monica, go ahead." 

Monica tried again. It wasn't just that 
she had trouble lifting herself into the 
van, but everytime the officers tried to 
help her into the van, she broke down 
crying. 
"I can't, I can't. Please." 
"Now Monica ... " 

One of the officers seemed like he was 
about to lose his patience. "I've got to 
get going." Randall stepped in. "Here 
you go Monica. Come on, go ahead. I'll 
help you." 
"I can't. I can't." 
"Sure you can. Here you go." 

Randall's voice remained at the same 
even keel throughout, and Monica 
eventually got into the van. She was go-
ing to the station for disorderly conduct, 
Randall found out afterwards. She'd 
probably be out within a few hours. 

The last call of the night was an acci- .. 
dent on East Rock. A tow truck passing 
by had called it in. A car was smashed 
against a rock wall; the driver was 
nowhere to be found. The inside of the 
car was littered with at least 20 beer 
cans. It reeked worse than a drunk's 
breath. 

Randall eventually tracked 
down the car owner's son. Yes sir, his 
Dad took the car. No sir, he hadn't seen 
him since. Yes sir, certainly sir, be 
would 
give his father Randall's 
telephone number. 

Another shift ended. Randall took his 
lunch at 11:30 p.m. 

Randall said be isn't optimistic about 
the chances for promotion. To really get 
ahead, he said, you need •a hook," 
someone who can help you through the 
political labyrinth of the department. 
Randall shrugs it ofT; he said he knew 
about the politics going in. It doesn't 
disappoint him. 
"I still have no idea what I'm going to 
do with my life" he said. He's thought 
about going back to school, maybe 
becoming a teacher. For the time being, 
however, he's happy with his work.
