Serge Lang's File 
Lelia Wardwell 
T'he File: Case Study in Correction 
(1977-1979) by Serge Lang 
1981 Springer-Verlag 712 pp. 
Everyone who knows Mathematics Pro-
fessor Serge Lang will agree he is not 
one to let things slide. The opinionated, 
energetic, argumentative character, 
who has been known to eat his meals in 
Commons so he can debate furiously 
with freshmen, has just published his 
first non-mathematical book. It comes 
as no surprise that the book is a study in 
controversy. 

T'he File by Serge Lang is literally a 
-4.fue-a collection of letters, articles, 
documents and memos that grew out of 
Lang's disapproval of a social science 
questionnaire he and several thousand 
other professors received four years 
ago. Who else but Lang would go so far 
as to publish a ftle of correspondences in 
a 712 page volume? 

It all began in the spring of 1977 
when two sociology professors, E.C. 
Ladd from the University of Connec-
ticut and S.M. Lipset from Stanford, 
issued a questionnaire to a random 
selection of 9 ,000 professors, entitled 
"The 1977 Survey of the American Pro-
fessoriate." The purpose of the survey, 
the researchers said, was to "collect in-
formation useful to the formation of 
sound education policy" by obtaining 
faculty opinion on their careers, current 
events and higher education. Lang said 
he found the survey •stupid: and its 
questions irrelevent, poorly phrased 
and prejudiced. Disgusted, he promptly 
threw it out without answering it. After 
he received two reminder notices from 
the surveyors to return it he was so ir-
ritated he wrote them an angry note 
telling them they were •parasites of the 
,.cademic community." "Lay offi" he 
wrote. 

Lipset wrote back defending himself. 
Other professors and deans got involved 
in the exchange primarily because Lang 
made xerox copies of his letters and sent 
them to people he thought would be in-
terested in the issue. The "carbon copy" 
list grew to 140 people. Within a year 
articles appeared in T'he Chronicle of 
Higher Education, The New York Review of 
Books and The New York Times. The en-
tire controversy, initiated and brewed 
by Lang himself, escalated to such an 
extent that the ftle was not officially 
closed by Lang until more than two 
years after the original questionnaire 
had been released. He closed it because 
it had "become logistically impossible to 
keep [the ftle] up and communicate it to 
the [carbon copy] liat following the same 
criteria of completeness which have 
been used up to now." 

Readers may be put off by The File at 
first. It is massive and composed of 
documents that at ftrSt glance seem bor-
ing and petty. The main issue of the 
questionnaire concems only sociologists 
and professors. 

But these first impressions are deceiv-
ing. The File is extremely interesting 
and often amusing. The important 
aspect of the book is not the debate over 
some obscure sociological survey. Lang 
subtitled his book, "Case Study in Cor-
rection." It is about the origin and 
spread of misinformation, how distor-
tions of the truth are so easily accepted 
and believed, what can be done to cor-
rect people's misunderstandings and 
how they react to these corrections. 

Lang explains in his introduction that 
he wants readers to look through the 
raw materials of the case so they can 
learn to decide for themselves about the 
issues and relate the problems in com-
munication here to comparable situa-
tions in their own experiences. 

The File provides an excellent glimpse 
into the 
world of the college 
faculty- what academic figures really 
think of each other and how they ex-
press themselves to their colleagues. For 
example, Professor Robert Merton 
from Columbia sent Lang this terse rep-
ly: "I find the peremptory and pro-
secutory tone of your letter anything 
but collegial; indeed, I find it most of-
fensive. I shall therefore not enter into 
correspondence with you on this or any 
other matter." 

It's possible to become so involved in 
the sub-plots that you forget entirely 
about the larger issues. For example, 
Lang and Professor Sigmund Diamond 
from Columbia attack Lipset for a book 
he had written on McCarthyism at 
Harvard in the early 1950s, and this 
gave rise to a new exchange of letters. 
Throughout the book, alliances develop 
and enemies are made. Correspondents 
mysteriously neglect to write back and 
are never heard from again. Reputa-
tions are harmed and questioned con-
stantly. 

At times the correspondence can be 
quite entertaining. 
Imagine these 
esteemed professors bickering with each 
other like schoolmates. In response to 
Lang's ftrSt angry note, Professor Lipset 
remarks "When and if ever [Lang] has 
an intellectual point to make, I will be 
more than happy to respond to it." 

Lang's character shines forth won-
derfully in his own letters. He even ad-
mits himself that "there is something in 
me that likes to agitate and make people 
aware of their assumptions." When he is 
writing to a sociology professor from 
Columbia he says of Ladd and Lipset: 
• As for basic courses, some of these guys 
ought to take spelling. On page 12 [of 
the survey] they misspell judgements' 
[sic]. Lipset misspelled 'publically' in his 
letter to me. How can one take that 
crowd seriously?" When Lang writes his 
last letter to Lipset, be signs ofT by 
declaring: •1 have decided to have no 
further communications with you. All 
further communications from you will 
be thrown out unopened." 

The File is an important and valuable 
book. It is an excellent resource for 
many academic fields including jour-
nalism, political science, psychology 
and sociology because it takes such an 
in-depth look at the basic problems of 
communication. And for the Yale stu-
dent who wishes only to hear our eccen-
tric math professor express himself 
bravely and defiantly to figures some-
what more formidible than college 
freshman, The File is ideal.
