The harvest moon shines brightly above 
the massive hulk of industrial silhou-
ettes in New Haven's warehouse 
district; Hamilton Street is silent, lit by 
persistently pink mercury street lights. 
Romance pervades every darkened cor-
ner of the Bethany Shirt Works buil-
ding. A man in tuxedo and battered 
sneakers makes his way up five flights of 
creaky stairs; a women's rhinestone 
tiara glistens in the factory's greasy 
parking lot. A small crowd gradually 
congregates upstairs in the studio head-
quarters of the Paper Mache Video In-
stitute. Tonight a 
time-honored 
American tradition finds new meaning, 
new vitality, in the Institute's long-
awaited, sixth annual Miss America 
Spectacular. 

A battery of television sets Uned up 
against one wall of a darkened room 
assail the viewer. Most are tuned to the 
Miss America Pageant, and the plastic 
glory of Atlantic City, New Jersey, is 
reproduced in Technicolor throughout 
the room. Many of the sets are wildly 
mis-tuned, 
with 
nearly 
fluorescent 
orange and green tones; sound blares 
loudly across the room in a distorted 
chorus. A young boy plays with a video 
tennis game, oblivious to a Brooke 
Shields commercial echoed some twenty 
times in front of him. Grown men 
manipulate toy tanks with remote-
control radios. From behind a large 
wooden cut-out of a tank, people help 
themselves to wine and cucumber dip. 

PMVI is not by any means a typical 
art gallery. Indeed, there are those who 
would insist that the Institute has ab-
solutely nothing to do with art. 

"I'm dedicated to avoiding art," 
muses Paul Rutkovsky, the patron saint 
of PMVI. Rutkovsky, who founded the 
Institute, teaches at New Haven's Paier 
School of Art. He keeps a low proftle, 
focusing attention on his work. "We live 
in a time where museums are cathe-
drals; they've served their purpose for 
holding icons of the past. This is why I 
have a passion for reaching out to a dif-
ferent audience, one that has. nothing to 
do with the A-R-T world. What is vital 
to our culture is off the picture plane, 
out of the proscenium and into the 
department 
stores and onto the 
highways." A large sign at the entrance 
to the Institute (which actually is located 
on the top floor of an old shirt factory) 
reads: "Dedicated To The Promotion 
Of Transient Culture." The medium? 
Xerox, of course. 

Rutkovsky chooses to construct most 
of his sculptural installations out of 
transient materials; 
videotape and 
papier mache figure prominently. Both 
decay in a comparatively short time 
span. Huge houses, built of papier 
mache and reaching anywhere from 
floor level to nearly ten feet high, haunt 
one studio area of the Institute. Con-
tained within each one is a flickering 
video display. As the viewer peers into 
the windows of each house, she or he 
enters into a smaller world. In one 
house, the video display consists of a 
child's head, the figure composed of 
papier mache relief, the video screen 
comprising a face, which changes from 
a smile to tears over a. period of time. 

In a taller house, a man sits in front 
of a silent TV screen, and the viewer 
gazes past him, through another win-
dow to an alleyway and into a video 
display of a street beyond it. Rutkovsky 
says the houses represent the forced 
containment of people in their in-
dividual boxes; houses, cars and institu-
tions are rigid enclosures of isolation. 
The inclusion of video screens serves as 
a reminder of television's omnipresent 
impact on our lives. People learn to 
relate to an inanimate box instead of 
each other. 

There is a stark sense of irony in Paul 
Rutkovsky's work. Confronting the 
culture's obsession with death machines 
with a childlike innocence, he combines 
some rather ugly images with happy 
colors and buoyant gesture. A recent 
exhibit, entitled "Paintings for the 
Future," consisted of sixty or seventy 
small paintings lined up on white walls. 
Rutkovsky remarks that they are "rep-
resentatives of military war machines in 
very slick fashion; I just wanted to pre-
sent them in a highly designed mode_. It 
was actually a very cynical presenta-
tion, because they were so pretty 
-graduated colors, muted greys. My 
cynicism hides occasionally, but it was 
out that month." Subject matter inclu-.

upturned 
tails 
of 
happily leaping 
whales, studies of tanks and a detailed 
mini-series called "Marty Watching 
TV," which depicted a young man with
