After hearing Gloria Steinem speak earlier in the week, it somehow seemed appropriate that I should plan to attend the Take Back the Night rally that Saturday, even though I had never been in anything remotely resembling a protest march before·. 

Seven of us from Branford College had dinner together, and then, at about 7:30, walked down to the New Haven Green. We stood at ftrst, and later sat in a semicircle on the grass, listening to a series of speeches which- while well worth hearing-lasted much longer than we'd been prepared for. 

Standing in the middle of a mass of women, we couldn't see beyond the few irregular rows immediately ahead of us, and those in the front ranks had moved offbefore we were aware that the march had started. Like the left-behind half of a stretched-out Slinky, we hurried to catch up. Two feet to the side, a man stood shouldering an unmarked Portapak, its funnel-shaped eye staring at us inscrutably. A pair of men, leaning against the more distant iron railing separating sidewalk and grass, shouted comments that were intended, I realized with surprise, to be encouraging. 

Moving diagonally along the path and out of the Green, we turned left, and, still behind, crossed Church Street at a run, catching up with the others in-the middle of Chapel. All the stores dark, the sidewalks deserted, we trod unseen upon the lane markings. 

The people on the sidewalks stopped and stared as we proceeded onward and rounded the corner to Crown Street, walking to the rhythm of our words: "Women unite! Take back the night! Women unite! Take back the night! Women unite! ... " A hard-faced cop stood by the parked patrol car at the intersection of Crown and Church Streets, and the halted drivers, one to a lane, dourly waited for the human train to pass. 

On the Macy's block the chanting changed: "Stop rape; fight back! Stop rape; fight back! Stop rape; fight back!" The Crown Theatre, however, was just ahead, its sign already visible, and I wondered, eager to hear, what would be said there. The words, when they came, were disappointingly weak: "Down with the Crown! Down with the Crown!" 

Those in front walked on, and, following, I was almost past the Crown's doorway when we again stopped. A new slogan, similarly unsatisfying, began: "Porno movies make ... big money! It's not smart! It's not funny!" A woman darted out from the crowd, attached a bumpersticker to the Crown's display window-hands flat against the glass- and ran back into the ranks as an orange-haired man, features contorted, ran out through the doorway and ripped it down. 

The marchers hissed as they watched him crumple it, clench it, and hurl it at the crowd, while two couples, newly arrived, stood bewildered on the sidewalk. Another woman retrieved it from the gutter: picked it up, wound up, and pitched it in his wake. He reappeared, apoplectic, and kicked it back. 

Moving on, past Crown and York, we found the streets suddenly populated. A group, looking from their Towers balcony: ten people lined up, applauding, giving the fist. "Come join us!" a woman in front of me yelled. 

Another right turn, and all along Howe faces watching: staring unabashed, seated at the windows of the Elm City Diner; standing inside and outside of Mamoun's. Mostly men, and for once it was safe to stare straight at them, and see their expressions. 

As we turned the fmal comer onto • Elm Street, going for Broadway, we feU silent between slogans. Teetering at the curb in front of Rudy's, a group of men-Yalies, by their attire-fLiled the gap with shouted and gestured obscenities. "Take a walk, pricks!" a woman bellowed from behind me, bullhorn-loudly. 

Alas, they did, staying with us, on the sidewalk, to the comer of Broadway and York. "Shitheads!" shouted a friend who I had never yet heard use such a word in such a way. 

Isolated couples scurried for cover on either side of the following block. A Saybrook College window was opened wide to emit the pounding sound of a • stereo just then turned up to maximum volume, and a woman looked down through the glassless rectangle, smiling. 

The voices of those in the street increased to a level slightly surpassing the stereo's din: ". . . THE PATRIARCHY'S GOT TO GO!" 

As we crossed High Street we began a new chant: "All rapists are male! Some of them even go to Yale!" 

Caught up in the flow of the crowd, the seven of us continued on back to the Green, where six of us waited together for one wandering member to emerge. Most of the women now stood side by side, easily circling the perimeter of the smaller block; and many of them that ran to meet in the circle's center. Our missing friend soon appeared; and we headed home.
