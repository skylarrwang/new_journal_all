Charlene Block has commuted to New 
Haven from Terryville, Connecticut 
five days a week since February of 
1979. In the last year, she has taken on-
ly two weeks of vacation, even though 
she qualifies for five. Her task is not an 
easy one. She heads up a rotating staff 
of full and part-time office workers who 
for two and a half years have tried to sell 
one cause to the Yale Community: 
union representation for Yale's 2,800 
Clerical and Technical employees. 

Since the late 1960s, various groups 
have tried to organize Yale's white collar 
workers into a union. Partly because of 
the difficulty of the task, none of them 
has succeeded. The National Labor 
Relations Board (NLRB) requires that 
an organization collect the signatures of 
thirty percent of the workforce being 
organized to hold an election on 
unionization. To date two groups have 
collected the 800 signatures necessary to 
call for an election at Yale. In both elec-
tions, held in 1971 and 1977, a majority 
of the employees voted against union 
representation. 

But these past failures have not ended 
the story. Today, two unions, the 
United Auto Workers (UAW) led by 
Charlene Block, and the Federation of 
University Employees Local 35, the 
union of Yale's 
dining hall and 
maintenance workers led by John 
Wilhelm, have ongoing campaigns to 
convince Yale's white collar workers to 
join their rank.s. 

The tenacity the unions have dem-
onstrated is not surprising in light of the 
TNJIRollon R.ggs 
size of the stakes involved. If a union 
successfully organized the clerical and 
technical employees, it would control 
the largest group of employees on cam-
pus. While the power to raise salaries, 
improve fringe benefits, or set up bet-
ter, and probably more expensive, 
working conditions would go to the 
workers, the successful organizer would 
get increased union dues as well as a 
certain share of the power which would 
come from such an organization. 

Because the clerical and technicals cover 
virtually every aspect of university ad-
ministration, a strike of all of these 
workers could, in the words of John 
Wilhelm, "cripple the University." 

With this kind of potential, the 
unions could go to the bargaining table 
and make significant changes in the 
status quo at Yale. While those changes 
would most likely improve the working 
conditions of a large number of Univer-
sity employees, others might not fare as 
well. The increased costs to the Univer-
sity could result in higher tuition, fewer 
services, and even the loss of some 
clerical and technical jobs which the 
University could no longer finance. 

Union organizers point out that 
working conditions, 
in 
particular 
salaries, are not as good as those of 
other white collar workers in New 
Haven. 
The lowest clerical 
and 
technical salary grade at Yale, which in-
cludes Mail Clerks, Delivery Aides, and 
Typists, pays between $3.80 and $5.00 
an hour.
