**Student Input in Faculty Decisions**

• • • No mechanism now
exists by which students
can have a say in faculty
promotion and tenure
decisions.  
may be student apathy is combined
with faculty carelessness or hypocrisy.
Teachers who ask students to fill out
course improvement forms overnight or
after class do often get response rates of
20 percent or lower, Apfel conceded.
Those who set aside time during class or
before an exam, however, get rates of
90 percent and up. Moreover, every
professor receives a letter from Dean
Lamar when he gets his blank forms advising him of the best way to get good
response rates.

These days, Apfel said, only 50 percent of the faculty even bothers to use
the Course Improvement form. 90 Percent of that 50 percent, however, have
expressed satisfaction with the present
system through a Student Response
Rate Questionnaire that is distributed
to all faculty. Apfel shrugs his shoulders
at those who don't pass out the form.
"Some people just don't want advice,
unfortunately," he said.

Other faculty members point to the
Yale Course Critique as a sign of student
indifference to course evaluation. Many
critiques in the student-run publication
are written on the basis of responses
from less than 25 percent of the people
enrolled in
the
course.
Matthew
Hamel, editor of the Critique, said he
does not believe low student response
rates to Critique questionnaires mean
that students are apathetic. Much of the
problem, he said, lies in getting questionnaires to and from students.
"I don't think it's accurate to say that
the Course Critique is a firm indication of
whether students care enough to have
courses evaluated," he said. "We've had
less than optimal distribution and collection techniques recently."

A worrisome precedent
While nothing on the order of Princeton's evaluation system has ever been
used for all of Yale College, various
segments of the University have used or
still use evaluation forms. Freshman
evaluations decided the fates of many a
faculty member between 1919 and
1954, according to Professor Robert S.
Brumbaugh. Under the guidelines of
the Freshman Year Program, established in 1919-20, Yale freshmen were
offered a
limited
curriculum and
learned in separate classrooms under
the instruction of a separate and self-
governing faculty. Brumbaugh, who
did time as a Freshman professor, said
both Freshman faculty and students
were on trial in those days; the faculty, to prove themselves worthy of a full
Yale faculty position, and the students,
to show themselves worthy of a place in
Yale's upper classes. Failure by either
party could mean ejection from the College.

Freshman teacher evaluation forms
were sent to instructors, department
chairmen and others, and provoked a
great deal of bad feeling among faculty
members, Brumbaugh said.
"The freshmen felt it their responsibility to get rid of as many professors
as they could," he said. "I don't know if
it accomplished anything, except that it
gave them a heady sense of power
which they could have done without."

George Wilson Pierson,
Yale's
University Historian, portrayed faculty
attitudes towards the Freshman Year
very differently in his Yale: The University College.
". . . They taught with such enthusiasm and success," he wrote, "that
the Freshman Year, which had been
established in faculty bitterness, won a tolerant, even a warm consent."

Brumbaugh said he doesn't oppose
teacher evaluations on principle, but
warned against making the results
public without individual professorial
approval.
"If you create an adversary student
/faculty relationship," he said,"I think it
could be very dangerous."

Positive aspects
In at least two instances, however,
teacher evaluation systems are being used
with apparent success. The Yale
Medical School's system, established on
a vote by the Medical School Council in
1970 and subsequently modified, requires faculty to collect evaluations
from
all students throughout the
school's four year program. Dr. Howard
Levitin, Dean of the Students'
School of Medicine, said the faculty are
"very sensitive to the pressure of student evaluations. But partly because
students never see the tabulated results
of their evaluations, and because faculty
salary levels do not ride on good evaluations,
system
remains stable.
Levitin said the evaluation forms have
proved useful in discussions of faculty
promotions.
The chairman of each department


which is recommending faculty will not
infrequently mention that a professor
got a 'six' from his students," he said.
"The fact is that very important changes
take place as a result of that input."
Dr. Robert Berliner, Dean of the
Medical School, said he's happy with
the role evaluation forms play.
"I think they're useful," he said, "I
think they tell us who needs to pay more
attention to teaching and who the stars
are."

Princeton's system is working well,
Finnie asserted, because it is used wisely.
The student opinions expressed on
Princeton's forms, he said, are nothing
more or less than another means by
which a professor's performance at
Princeton may be evaluated. No tenure
decision, Finnie said, is made solely on
the basis of forms.
"It's just a factor in an overall decision," he said. "I would doubt if it's the
major factor. That isn't how you get
tenure at an institution like Princeton."

Finnie cautioned against viewing
evaluation forms as a system with solely
negative implications for the faculty.
Many junior faculty at Princeton applying for positions at other schools use the
results of student evaluations as proof of
their skills, he said.
"You know, there are positive aspects
to this system, too!" he said. "If you're
good, it can help you!"

This means you
The YCC's belated interest in faculty
appointments does not strengthen any
arguments for student responsibility in
teacher evaluations. Bacdayan admitted
that the YCC did not initiate the present administrative debates on evaluation forms and had little to do with the
creation of the Tobin Committee.
"There has been no effort made," he
said, but "it's something we're interested
in."

Given faculty attitudes toward
evaluation forms, however, it seems
clear that students who want a say in
faculty appointments are going to have
to take an active role in fighting for it.
And once an evaluation system is in
place, Taft suggested, the test of student
mettle has only begun.
"If the University would do something like this," he said, "they would in
effect be saying 'Look, we're going to
give you students some responsibility.'"
