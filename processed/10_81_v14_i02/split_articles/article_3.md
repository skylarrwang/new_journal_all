**Title: From the sidelines**

I couldn't help but feel excited as I watched the women's march leave the New Haven Green on September 26. It was about 10:15 on a Saturday night and the 1, 200 women marching through the streets of the city were a very impressive group, both in their fervor and their numbers. 

The "Take Back the Night" rally and march was my first major women's event. I viewed it as a chance for women to show their togetherness in a struggle that affects all of us: the right to walk the streets without fear. It was a symbolic effort, surely; an hour later a woman would still have to call a friend to go out on the street. But symbolic actions take on meaning when they unite people. 

I had no problem with the fact that men weren't allowed to march. The whole purpose of the event was to promote women's solidarity. In fact, two women who had come with me out of curiosity to see the marchers joined the demonstration on its way back to the Green. Later they told me what a tremendous experience it had been, just marching with other women. 

After watching the march, I went to a party in Pierson College where I heard two Yale men bragging to each other about yelling at "those women in the street." 

"Yeah," said one, "we were yelling 'Blow me you dyches' and they didn't know what to do." 

When I asked him why he had yelled at the women he said, "I hate militant women." 

I wanted to ask him, "What do you want, a passive dog?" but I didn't say it. This young man obviously didn't have the beginnings of any kind of consciousness about the march or for that matter anything to do with women. 

Before walking away from me he said, "All the rapists just hid anyway until the march was over, so what?" 

So What? 

I have learned from the experience that some men feel so threatened by marches for women's rights that they form macho groups, mobs if you will, and scream sexual insults at the women. Would such men behave the same way if they were alone? And, more important, why do these men feel so threatened by women marching together in the streets? 

I talked with some friends after the march who were both shocked and depressed by the viciousness of some Yale men's responses as the women marched down Elm Street. They said that as they passed through the campus they received more vocal attacks from men than anywhere else along the route. Some men followed the marchers shouting obscenities. One of my friends who marched said that when she looked one of them in the eye, he looked away, as if he couldn't confront her individually but only with his group. Another woman told me, "It was the first time I really had confirmed what I already knew, that the white· male power structure is really that vicious. These are our future leaders in their embryonic stages who are yelling 'Blow me you dyches.'" 

As a man, or better, a person, I feel I should have respect enough for other people to listen and try to learn. What's it like to have a constant fear in the street or to be verbally harrassed every single day? These are things I have no understanding of because I am a man. 

To gain an understanding one must listen and acknowledge that male violence against women is a major problem in society; until it ceases we will never have a just and equal place to live. One must be sensitive to what different people see as the causes of that violence and especially what women feel are the ways to combat it. 

The Yale men yelling insults in the streets are to a large extent what the women's march was directed against. In essence they proved the march's value and its necessity not only in New Haven, but especially here at Yale. 

Learning to respect other people is for me a basic part of education. Still, I have no respect for those men who continue to batter women both verbally and physically.

**Title: The election that won't be**

Don't let the busses to the polls fool you. Or the name of the political unknown on the Republican ballot for mayor. The polls will open all day November 3, but there's no real election for mayor in New Haven this year. Biagio "Ben" DiLieto-and what critics call the reconstituted political machine-will run the city for at least two more years. 

In last month's Democratic primary, where New Haven traditionally selects its mayor, DiLieto breezed by State Senator Tony Ciarlone, a lackluster campaigner who probably couldn't have made a scandal out of a teapot dome. Except for a few of Ciarlone's most ardent campaigners, no one ever seriously questioned DiLieto's re-election chances. 

DiLieto's chances in the general election are even better. His Republican opponent, Elaine Noe, has few people to count on. The city Republicans are in disarray. They have about 5,000 registered voters in a city of over 120,000. They have just one alderman on the city's 27-member board. The Republicans couldn't fmd a mayoral candidate until a week after their nominating convention this summer; for a while, they even considered backing Ciarlone on a double ticket. 

You'd think DiLieto would have had more trouble this year. At well-attended public meetings throughout the city, residents have yelled at the mayor over many of his administration's decisions. Even though Ciarlone failed to rally opposinon to DiLieto, the issues his now-defunct campaign raised still need to be heard. 

Ciarlone noted, for instance, that the DiLieto administration recently instituted a new sewer charge. In 1980, it reduced trash pick-ups to once a week; soon after, rats began crawling out from railroad cuts in the Hill area. The administration has moved to close city
