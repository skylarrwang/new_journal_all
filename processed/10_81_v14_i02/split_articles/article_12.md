**Title: Research: An approach against leukemia**

This year over 1 ,500 Americans will fall 
victim to Leukemia. By now, the dread-
ed blood disease's effects are well known 
to doctors; an acute leukemia patient 
has from a few days to a few months to 
live, while the chronic patient may have 
up to five years. 


But with 
luck, 
the 
gruesome 
leukemia statistics may start to change 
as early as next year. As a result of the 
research of Drs. Csaba H orvath and 
Krishna Kalghatgi (Yale Engineering 
and Applied Science) and Dr. Joseph 
Bertino (Yale Pharmacology), effective 
treatment may soon be available for not 
only leukemia, but breast cancer, lym-
phoma and head and neck cancers as 
well. 


For years, 
Leukemia researchers 
have had an anticarcinogen that rids a 
patient's bloodstream of leukemic cells 
but also destroys tissue and bone mar-
row. Bertino and Horvath have found a 
way to inject the anticarcinogen into the 
bloodstream and then filter it out before 
it can damage the body. The ftltering is 
done through an enzyme reaction that 
takes place outside the body in a 
machine called an enzyme reactor .

Currently the researchers are testing 
their technique on dogs with encourag-
ing results. If all goes as planned, the 
machine could be used on human be-
ings in a little over a years time, Bertino 
said. 


The developments in cancer research 
which led to the discoveries of Bertino, 
H orvath and Kalghatgi can be traced 
back as early as 1949. In that year, a 
drug named Methotrexate (MTX) was 
developed which could fight leukemia, 
lymphoma, and breast, head and neck 
cancers. Unfortunately, it turned out to 
be equally good at destroying human 
tissue and bone marrow. 


In 1971 , Bertino's laboratory distilled 
a strain of bacteria capable of breaking 
down MTX into harmless by-products. 
From the bacteria Bertino derived an 
enzyme dubbed Carboxypeptidase G' 
(CPDG•). 


The question then became how to put 
CPDG•, into use against leukemia. 
Researchers considered a "rescue opera-
tion" in which a leukemia patient would 
be injected with a potentially lethal dose 
of MTX. Human bone marrow and
