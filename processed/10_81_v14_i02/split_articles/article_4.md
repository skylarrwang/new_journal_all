public schools and assign principals to 
cover two schools at once. DiLieto re-
jected citizens' calls to support a bill to 
make Yale re-imburse the city for tax 
exemptions on services. Meanwhile, he 
laid ofT city workers, reducing the 
municipal workforce to below 2,000 
employees for the fJISt time in recent 
history while giving his top aides raises. 
And a series of housing authority scan-
dals erupted this summer that led 
DiLieto to seek the resignation of its 
board of commissioners. 

Ciarlone also hoped to capitalize on 
information he received from people 
• who lost jobs under DiLieto, or who lost 
power struggles with his administra-
tion. These people brought Ciarlone 
complaints about how Ben DiLieto 
allegedly sought to re-build the political 
machine that Frank Logue knocked out 
of City Hall for four years. They 
charged that because President 
Reagan's budget cuts have left cities less 
money to create jobs for political allies 
the way past New Haven mayors have, 
DiLieto has had to resort to illegal, or at 
least underhanded, means. 

Both Ciarlone and city labor leaders 
charged DiLieto consistently bypassed 
civil service rules on testing and seniori-
ty in advancing employees through the 
city bureaucracy. Indeed, employees 
with up to 20 years' experience received 
lay-ofT notices this summer, but not 
others with far less time on the job and 
ties to DiLieto and his last campaign. 

A related issue Ciarlone and his sup-
porters raised cent~red on the voucher 
system. Since DiLieto couldn't create 
jobs out of the payroll, they maintained, 
he put allies on the voucher system on a 
regular basis, even though n officially 
functions as a budget for temporary 
~ work. Alderman John Fabrizio, who 
ran on Ciarlone's ticket in the 14th 
ward, publicized the names on the 
voucher list; it included DiLieto's cam-
paign treasurer in 1979, relatives of his 
executive assistant and personnel direc-
tor, and many others with similar con-
nections. 

Rather than examining these issues, 
voters more often wondered about 
Ciarlone: What does he stand for? Who 
is he? 

To political insiders, Ciarlone's ob-
jections to DiLieto's alleged misconduct 
sounded hollow because of the make-up 
of Ciarlone's own organization. A key 
backer of his was Arthur Barbieri, 
former Democratic town chairman. 
Barbieri used to run the machine and 
he helped to elect D iLieto in 1979. 
Once in office, DiLieto abandoned Bar-
bieri. 

The make-up of the group that 
worked for Ciarlone raised another 
question: what was his alternative to 
DiLieto's methods of running the city? 
Aligned with Barbieri in Ciarlone's 
camp was Frank Logue- the man who 
knocked Barbieri out of power in 1975. 
Logue's statements 
in 
support of 
Ciarlone 
reflected 
a 
distaste 
for 
DiLieto; like others, he didn't have 
much to say for Ciarlone. 

Where were DiLieto's other potential 
opponents? Logue said he had enough 
of political office. Hank Parker, who 
ran against DiLieto and Logue in the 
1979 democratic 
primary, 
backed 
DiLieto this time. 

When Parker, the state's highest 
ranking black official, ran in 1979, 
speculation arose that he had made a 
deal with DiLieto who had lost to Logue 
twice before. Whether or not he made a 
deal, Parker drew liberal support away 
from Logue, and this proved enough 
for DiLieto to win. Since then, one of 
Parker's top campaign aides has become 
the director of civil service and person-
nel. Parker's wife has been paid on the 
voucher system. And Parker himself 
went out on primary day this year and 
handed out literature for DiLieto out-
side the polls in the black wards. 

DiLieto won by less than a clear-cut 
landslide 
last month's primary 
because under half of the city's 46,000 
registered Democrats bothered voting 
-the lowest turnout in ten years. Don't 
expect many more on November 3. 

In the absence of any real campaign-
ing by DiLieto, Republican Elaine Noe 
has used her candidacy to make some 
interesting comments. She called for 
dismantling the housing authority; 
criticized the reduction in the number 
of police officers and promised not to 
collect absentee ballots in order to ques-
tion the high percentage of votes 
DiLieto always 
receives 
from 
the 
absentee ballots his workers bring in. 

But Noe-a travel agent who unsuc-
cessfully challenged Tony Ciarlone for 
his state senate seat last year- hasn't 
caused much of a stir in the latter part 
of the election campaign that never hap-
pened in New Haven this year. She's 
just been talking issues; issues that 
won't go away.
