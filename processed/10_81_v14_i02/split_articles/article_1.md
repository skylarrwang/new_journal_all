One criticism we recieved about our 
first issue was that we offered no ex-
planation of whoÂ·we were and what we 
were doing. We hoped to show rather 
than tell, but perhaps we made the 
magazine seem too impersonal in the 
process. The Nan Journal was founded 
by Daniel Yergin and Jerry Bruck in 
1967. During those turbulent times, 
the magazine covered the riots in New 
Haven, the aborted attempt to move 
Vassar to Yale, and the arrival of Jim 
Morrison and the Doors in New 
Haven. Some of their articles were so 
well-conceived and well-written that 
they're still interesting to read today. 


Twelve years after its inception, The 
Nan Journal folded- a victim of bad 
luck and indifference. Now that we're 
back, here are some things you should 
know about our format. 

We cover almost exclusively Yale 
and New Haven stories. We don't do 
this because our view of the world is 
myopic, but because we want to do 
what we can do best. With our limited 
resources, and your limited time, we 
think it wise to provide you with in-
formation you probably can't get in 
Time or Nansweelc. 

We espouse no political ideology. In 
fact were looking for intelligent 
opinion from many different 
perspectives. We hope to print some 
articles that will challenge your 
convictions rather than merely affirm 
them. 

Finally, we need your help. Send us 
your article ideas, criticisms, and 
letters to the editor. It would be a 
simple but heartening afftrmation that 
the process of communication has 
indeed gone full circle.
