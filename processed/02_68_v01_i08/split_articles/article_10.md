play into such heightened prominence that 
it very nearly smothers the sense of tragic 
loss and bitter reflection that defines the 
agony of the protagonist and renders in-
telligible the mad confusion of identity 
and of motive that complicates the 
grotesque plot. Here there is no question, 
as in certain past productions, of any 
pretentious wrenclting into a questionable 
"relevance." Pirandello's underlying in-
sights into the sufferings of the self-
conscious personality are relevant enough. 
It is more a question of balance and of tact. 

Carl Weber's direction appears to have 
been based on working assumptions which 
help to explain the texture of this produc-
tion. One assumption denotes the play as 
a tragic farce (a favorite genre in a world 
inclined to affix the same label to life). 
Another categorizes the protagonist as a 
"schizoid individual," to borrow Weber's 
phrase in his program note. The director 
sees this case of schizophrenia as an image 
of a schizophrenic world disrupted and 
dismayed by the experience of the first 
World War and the deluded ideals of a 
rising fascism. The diagnosis of schizo-
phrenia leads in turn to an assumption 
about the role of Henry IV: it is more 
lunatic than imperial. The main character, 
not sane at base, decides to maintain an 
artificial identity that manifests itself in 
the incoherent ravings and visibly ludi-
crous posturings of a madman rather than 
in the imperial pride and humiliations 
of the German Emperor Henry IV. 

To play up the potentially farcical in 
Pirandello's tragedy is to convert what 
Pirandello called "humor"-the ironic 
perception of life's unflattering contradic-
tions-into more superficial comic "busi-
ness." The temptation is hard to resist, 
especially in the opening scenes of the first 
act, which take an awkward length of time 
to piece together the story of the past 
· accident responsible for the protagonist's 
lapse into the illusion that he is Henry IV. 
Weber has chosen to sketch in the sup-
porting characters of the play in broadly 
comic strokes, accenting the vanity and 
sense of self-importance of the Doctor, 
Belcredi and Matilda. The Countess and 
her lover spat in the familiar manner of the 
mutually irritating old couple, and Bel-
credi directs his sarcastic arrogance toward 
the Doctor as well. The "I know best" 
attitudes which typify Pirandello's busy-
bodies are thus heightened into a three-
way contest for psychological supremacy. 

The raised eyebrows, grimaces, gestures of 
contempt or indifference take on such 
comic importance that one is likely to 
forget what the discourse is all about. 
Belcredi's taunting wit and aristocratic 
nonchalance are rendered with speciaJ 
skill by Stacy Keach, whose comic timing 
and playing to the audience give a neces-
sary edge of superiority to the character 
who is later moved into a relationship of 
deeper antagonism toward the central 
figure. But the initial tone established by 
the comic psychological sparring of the 
early scenes, and continued almost without 
change in the opening scene of Act II, 
tends to dominate audience response to 
such an extent that, when Henry confronts 
the others, the laughter continues and 
deeper ironies are missed. It is amusing to 
see the know-it-ails taken off guard by the 
antic emperor, but in focusing on their 
superficial discomfiture the presentation 
blurs the more radicaJJy disturbing lines 
of Henry's addresses to them. The hectic 
pace with which Haigh speeds through 
the speeches of his initial scene somehow 
contributes to the farcical tempo and also 
makes those speeches more opaque than 
they ought to be. It is only toward the 
end of that act, when Henry points to his 
portrait and begs to be set free from it, that 
the significant depths of his disturbance 
are revealed; the earlier glimpses have 
been obscured by the dazzling visual im-
pact of an animated ikon reducing his 
frightened audience to momentary in-
security and dismay. 

It is the last scene of the play, how-
ever, which is in danger of losing most 
of its ironic point under the influence of 
comic tone. Henry seems to have borrowed 
some of Belcredi's sarcasm in that scene 
when he rails at the Doctor, and depicts 
the alternatives of re-entering the modem 
world. But the more he sounds like Bel-
credi the less trenchant his insights be-
come. When he accuses life "out there" of 
being no more than a masquerade, there 
is more than sarcasm at stake. When he 
loses control of himself, embraces Frida 
and stabs Belcredi, there should be no 
room for any laughter other than his own. 
And if the audience does laugh as the 
wounded Belcredi is dragged away, it is 
partly because they have been conditioned 
earlier to relish the discomfiture of the 
vain, self-assured joker. 

Weber's diagnosis of schizophrenia may 
not agree with all the symptoms Pirandello 
has provided for his central figure, but it 
does help to explain some of the produc-
tion's more startling visual effects. One 
is tempted, of course, to see the use of 
the revolving stage as a kind of emblem 
for the split personality. The play opens 
with an unexpected shift of scene, and the 
thematics of deceptive appearances and 
disquieting uncertainties are suggested 
before a word of dialogue is uttered. 

Closer to the personality of Henry himself 
is the device of "split" blocking in the 
first confrontation scene. Belcredi and 
Matilda are set at opposite ends of the 
stage, and Henry lurches and stumbles 
between these two points as his mind 
moves from theme to theme. Weber's 
modification of Henry's costume in this 
first encounter also reflects a concern for r 
visualizing the dividedness of Henry's ego: 
instead of having him wear the sackcloth 
from the start, Weber has the servants 
help him into and out of it as his mood 
demands, accenting the restless uneasiness 
with which he is tormented even within 
the limits of the imperial role itself. 

One of the deeper sources of Henry's 
agony is his realization that in the twelve 
years of his unconscious madness he has 
been cheated out of youth and out of love. 
He awakes to find not only his hair grown 
gray, but his whole inner being gray, 
decayed, finished. He makes that torment 
explicit in the final act, and its force is 
what then leads so directly to the impulse 
that brings on the castastrophe. But when 
that statement is made, Robert Taylor's set 
also takes on a new meaning: its gray and 
shabby tones are the reOection of Henry's 
"real" identity; the medieval trappings 
which lend it some color and life are the 
exact counterpart of Henry's costume role 
as emperor. Color, life, vitality come onlY 
by way of the mask. Thorn Peterson's 
costuming echoes and reinforces the 
theme. The modem world's costume is 
formal black and white, or in the case of 
Frida's:dress, a neutral and pallid gray. 
The medieval costumes provide the visual 
color and warmth that are so lacking bOtb 
on and under the surface of the modern· 
world characters. Kathleen Widdoes as 
Frida puts life and meaning into an em-
