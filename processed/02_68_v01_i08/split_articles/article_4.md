**Title: Language and the talking computers**
**Author: John Adams and Tim Bates**
**Page number(s): 3-9**

John Adams, a junior in Yale College, is 
m~~joring in Mathematics and Philosophy. 
Tim Bates is a sophomore in Yale College. 
The scientist collected a ream of print-out 
from Yale's computer. He leafed quickly 
through the results to the last page and 
then began circling letters in red as he 
mentally converted the cryptographic com-
puter output. 


"You can see," he apologized, "we 
haven't worked out the order of the 
negative. The 'n' should be between the 
'z' and the 't'." The word should have 
been "wasn't," but it came out "wanst." 
As it read now, the response was a mean-
ingless tongue-twister, but it was close to 
being correct. 


The sentence circled in red was not 
simply the computer's mindless response 
to a program. It marked a step closer to 
having a computer "think" like us, for in 
this simple example the computer had 
selected the word order, tense and mood 
of the sentence. The machine was not 
simply "talking" English; it was "think-
ing" English. Its teacher is Sydney M. 
Lamb, associate professor of linguistics 
at Yale. 


"We're trying to study the language 
system people have within their brains," 
Lamb explained. "We have a model of the 
information which makes it possible for 
man to speak English. We put this in-
formation into the computer and turn it 
on, and hope the computer will produce 
English. Later, we'll get it to understand 
English." 


His hands floated descriptively through 
the air as he searched for a more ex-
pressive, though not technical, definition of 
his project. "You know the brain's lan-
guage structure is in the form of a net-
work. We're trying to figure out what 
the properties of that network are." 


Describing the process of communica-
tion in the brain consists of two parts. 
"First, we have various questions about 
how the network is organized. Second, 
we have questions about how signals move 
through the network." 


Lamb's hypothetical network-that is, 
his description of the brain's language 
structure--consists of a series of strata. 
His book Outline of Stratificational 
Grammar states that languages possess at 
least four strata. English has six: three 
major components, each composed of 
two strata. The lower strata are concerned 
with speech sounds; the middle are basical-
ly grammar, though elementary-school 
ideas about right grammar and wrong 
grammar are supplanted by something 
closer to actual usage; the higher strata 
deal with concepts and meaning. 


The process of speech involves move-
ment of impulses from the top strata to 
the bottom while the process of under-
standing is just the opposite. For instance, 
concepts are represented by points htgh 
in the network; they are connected to the 
words and phrases lower in the network 
which stand for these concepts. In speak-
ing, impulses are sent down along the 
connections from meanings to another 
level where the grammar of the sentence 
is formed. Still lower, the network con-
nections lead to muscles of the speech 
mechanism. "Of course," smiled Lamb, 
"we don't try to put that part in the com-
puter." Likewise, those without ESP must 
reverse the process when they bear the 
sentence, going upward from sounds to 
concepts. 


"So far, this is true only in theory. We 
are only beginning to make the theory 
operative in the machines." 


Lamb, who graduated from Yale in 
1951, majored in economics. "I'm sure;â€¢ 
he said, "what I learned in econ inftuenced 
my approach to linguistics." He did 
graduate work in linguistics at Berkeley. 
T here he ran a project designing a com-
puter system to translate from Russian to 
English, the same two languages used in 
his present studies. 


In the fall of 1964 he returned to Yale, 
"because I was an Old Blue and liked the 
people here in linguistics very much, and 
it was time for a change." But because all 
the "bugs" are not yet ironed out of his 
work and because of more basic differ-
ences of analysis with other groups of 
linguists, Lamb's work at Yale has not 
escaped criticism. "We are controversial. 
We have yet to be accepted. The main 
difficulty is that people don't understand 
what we're doing. It's just a matter of 
time until they become familiar with our 
concepts. There is not much literature on 
this yet." 


"Our competition," he went on, "is lead 
by Professor Noam Chomsky at MIT. 
The trouble with his theory is that it 
can't account for the fact that people 
speak." 


Chomsky and the "transformationalists" 
have modernized linguistics by setting for 
themselves the admirable goal of describ-
ing, with systematic precision, all the sen-
tences that people can speak. Previously, 
linguists tried to classify and describe 
various facts about a language without 
constructing a unified whole. 


"Chomsky's system lacks psychological 
reality because it fails to provide any 
account of the way a person can express 
his thoughts through the use of language. 
His model relates only to sentences, not to 
people." Lamb grinned as he found a 
clincher. "You see, we know people 
can speak." 


Recently, Chomsky has adopted some 
stratificational concepts, but in Lamb's 
opinion he has not included enough. H e 
distinguishes "deep structure" from 
"surface structure" (how the sentence 
sounds), but does not distinguish these 
levels as sharply as the stratificationalists 
do. Chomsky has phonetic features in his 
"deep structure," as well as in his "surface 
structure." Lamb's deep structure, which 
he calls the semem ic stratum (the sem- is 
from semantics), consists of network con-
nections. In Lamb's system, phonetic 
features are found only at the bottom of 
the network. 


Their dispute does not rest solely on 
the abstract concepts of bow to describe 
a language system. Lamb sees Chomsky's 
system as lacking from a more practical 
standpoint. One of the goals in linguistics--
just as in the other sciences-is to account 
for the data with the simplest possible 
gramm ar, "without a lot of ad hoc rules, 
devised to cover a multitude of particular 
situations." In his recent review of 
Chomsky's book, Aspect of the Theory 
of Syntax, Lamb attacked the transforma-
tion (process-description) approach on this 
central point, seeing the system as "per-
haps its own severest critic, in that it 
demonstrates very effectively the needless 
complexity forced upon the grammarian 
by process description." 


"Maybe we can bring out the difference 
between the two systems with a non-
linguistic example," said Lamb. "A 
'process description' would say man is 
descended from the ape. I would say no, 
they're both derived from a common 
ancestor." Lamb would refuse to give 
priority to any member of the same 
stratum, but would rather say they are 
both derived from a point above them 
in the network. 


"I have another example. In baseball, 
there is the high-level concept of a strike. 
I would say that it has three manifesta-
tions: a swing-and-a-miss, a called strike, 
or a foul ball. A transformational descrip-
tion would call a swing-and-a-miss a 
'basic' strike, and then proceed to derive 
the other two by transformations." 


Computer projects on linguistics are 
springing up throughout the country, 
though few exhibit true linguistic sophisti-
cation. Most try to overcome the problems 
of accurate description of language by 
adding enough machinery to "cover up" 
deeper weaknesses. IBM, for example, 
exhibited a Russian-English translator 
at the New York World's Fair. "It pro-
duced," commented Lamb, "a quite 
primitive translation. It's being used now 
by the Air F orce. Linguists tend to frown 
on it." 


The University of Chicago and the 
RAND Corporation are both doing com-
puter-aided linguistic research. Another 
important project is located in Grenoble, 
France, and the Prague school of linguists 
is also doing considerable work, as are 
several Russian algebraists. One of Lamb's 
former students, now at the University of 
Wisconsin, is training a computer to sim-
ulate a linguistic field worker. "When a 
linguist encounters a new language," 
Lamb said, "he learns it, analyzes it and 
then constructs its grammar. This guy is 
trying to program a computer to do what 
a linguist does to analyze a new language. 


"However, there is nothing like our 
project, nothing with these particular 
goals." When attained, Lamb's goal of 
modeling the brain's language network 
will open up new areas for computer use. 


Lamb considers an important product of 
his studies to be linguistic automation. 
Scholarly and scientific information could 
be placed in computer storage, and this 
information could be retrieved through 
high-speed computers. 


"Also, if the computer can understand 
English, we may simplify the process of 
communication by allowing people to talk 
to computers in ordinary language," added 
Lamb. In fact, the old dictum of tenure 
could be rephrased to "program or 
perish." The published book would be 
replaced by a session with a computer 
that would make the information available 
to all. 


But what could be done along these 
lines for English could also be done for 
Russian, French or any other language. 
Seen from this aspect, machine transla-
tion would be simply a corollary to more 
general advances in linguistic automation. 


"However, the application I'm most 
interested in is the understanding of the 
brain. The most striking feature of our 
system is that it may indicate something 
general about the operation of the human 
brain. I would hope to be able to extend 
this project to discover how man's brain 
organizes knowledge in general."
