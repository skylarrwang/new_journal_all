Teach-ins
The article that begins on page 10, "The 
Cold War and America's foreign mythol-
ogy," is a complement to a piece that ran 
in this magazine last fall, "The success 
and tragedy of Richard Lee," by John 
Wilhelm. The Richard Lee article con-
fronted the so-called liberal assumptions 
that have been the more or less dominant 
mode in domestic affairs since 1932. The 
Cold War article similarly deals with the 
language, policies and assumptions of post-
World War II foreign policy. It is the con-
fluence of Vietnam and the urban crisis Â· 
that has brought us to this point of neces-
sary re-evaluation, to what seems to be 
the end of an era. In both articles, the 
writers not only argue that those liberal 
assumptions are no longer valid, but that 
they were never truly valid. 


If this is the case, then the normal 
process is to seek new assumptions that 
promise better solutions, to define a new 
vocabulary and to suggest new avenues of 
action. This need, appropriately intel-
lectual and quite proper to the university 
community, is finding a response in the 
Yale community, and one of the clearest 
demonstrations has been the recent series 
of teach-ins. 


They proved that it's possible to bring 
people together for useful discussions that 
succeed at presenting information defin-
ing problems and suggesting alternatives. 
The most obviously impressive was the 
last, held on Monday, February 12. The 
subject was billed as the draft, but the 23 
professors covered a wide range of topics. 
Some were polemical, but many points of 
view were presented. In the middle were 
the liberals, men like political scientist 
Robert Dahl and James Tobin, former 
member of the Council of Economic 
Advisors, for whose generation World 
War II had been the war and who now 
find their basic assumptions about liberal 
democracy severely tested. 


But the other teach-ins--Conscience 
and the Draft, held on January 28, and 
The Pueblo Crisis, held on January 30--
were no less valuable. From the perspec-
tive of a psychiatrist, Dr. Robert Lifton 
discussed the "circles of self-deception" 
that government leaders impose upon 
themselves and also the process of 
"psychic numbing," by which people close 
themselves off from the human suffering 
they inflict. Law professor Clyde Summers 
thought the Coffin indictment had raised 
a fundamental problem for which he saw 
no quick solution: can a man test a Jaw 
through the legal system without putting 
himself in jeopardy if he loses? Harry 
Benda, chairman of the Council on 
Southeast Asian Studies, pointed out that 
Korea and Vietnam are not interchange-
able, that the Vietnamese communists are 
quite indigenous to their country. One 
of the most moving speakers was John 
White, now a Yale MAT and a local high 
school teacher, who--from coded mes-
sages reviewed while on duty with the 
Navy as a nuclear weapons officer, and 
from what he himself admitted was an un-
certain conversation with a chief petty 
officer months later-suggested that the 
Gulf of Tonkin Resolution showed dis-
turbing signs of having been a put-up job. 


The teach-ins also have another value, 
that of responding to a specific crisis or 
situation, aS in the case of the Pueblo. 
Normally, a crisis suddenly blows into the 
headlines. Washington gets grim, and the 
only analysis you can get in the midst of 
the event is that of Eric Severeid, gloomily 
blowing air bubbles, or that of Marvin 
Kalb, solemn-facedly quoting State De-
partment officials. At such a time, it's use-
ful to hear from somebody like Benda 
who can bring special competence and 
perspective to bear. 


**Title: Drive**

The urban crisis is at the core of this year's 
Yale Charities Drive. Two thirds of the 
proceeds are going to agencies in New 
Haven which run small but promising 
projects. The Drive is supporting the 
Dixwell Legal Rights Association and the 
Hill Action Group, which will use the 
funds to construct a sewing machine 
center in the Hill area. The Drive is also 
aiding the Hill Arts Co-operative, a stage 
company that has become the greatest 
outlet for creative expression in the Hill 
area, the service fraternity Alpha Phi 
Omega, and the U.S. Grant Foundation, 
which provides personal tutoring for stu-
dents in New Haven. 


The remaining third of the Drive's funds 
will go to agencies working in cities 
abroad. Accion. which provides services 
in such slums as Rio de Janeiro's Favela 
Varginha, will receive funds for self-help 
projects. The World University Service 
will use Yale's contribution to build a 
hostel for student housing in Manila, and 
the Drive will also support Yale-in-China's 
efforts in Hong Kong.
