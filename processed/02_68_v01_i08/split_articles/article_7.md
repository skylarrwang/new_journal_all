Walk in, turn left, and enter the foyer. In 
front of you hangs a swirling canvas covered 
with orange volcanic eruptions, streaks and 
blobs of black flotsam, and overhanging col-
loidal clouds suspended in a dense dirty blue 
underlayer. A small strip of paper says "Sea 
Picture With Black" by Helen Frankenthaler. 

Behind a glass front is an irregular 
quadrilateral within a pentagon. The glass 
ripples, faster and faster, bands of light and 
shadows multiplying and racing to escape 
from the whirlpool. 

Paintings and sculptures are now on display 
in the home of Trumbull College Master 
Ronald Dworkin. On loan from the private 
collection of Mrs. Susan Morse Rilles, wife 
of professor emeritus of English Literature 
Frederick Hilles, they are works by con-
temporary French, English and American 
artists in a wide range of styles. The exhibition 
began on December 9 and will end February 
17, and is open to the public from 3:00 to 
5:00p.m. 

The gallery is part of a continuing experi-
ment designed to bring students and art into 
closer touch with each other. Last year 
Trumbull presented an exhibit from the Leo 
Castelli Gallery as well as a selection from 
the San Francisco Poster Show, and Master 
Dworkin hopes to obtain a gallery of Robert 
Rauschenberg's drawings of Dante's Inferno 
in the near future. 

The Rilles exhibition is displayed in the 
Dworkin's living room, dining room and 
entrance foyer, and along two flights of wind-
ing stairs. The unusual setting is extremely 
effective in putting the viewer at ease and 
enabling him to examine the art from various 
sides, angles and distances, and in relation to 
its surroundings. The dining room, for ex-
ample, features a bizarre table setting with 
two diners, including a detached plaster hand 
clutching a fork. '1be Great American Nude 
S69" and "Dark Portrait" are among many 
provocative works on the upper floors.
