presents which suggests that Taft would 
DOt have supported a "counter-insurgency" 
dfort if be felt American economic inter-
ests or prestige were sufficiently at stake. 
Todd Gitlin's "Counter-Insurgency: 
Myth and Reality in Greece" and John 
Oittling's "The Origins of China's Foreign 
Policy" continue the approach of raising 
disturbing evidence against orthodox 
history and elucidating what might have 
been the "real purpose" of American 
policy. Both authors question the Ameri-
can thesis that the Greek guerrillas and 
Chinese communists were fanatic radicals, 
ioftexibly bent on destroying all democracy 
and educated people, opposing the United 
States and serving the wishes of the 
Soviet Union. Close examination in both 
cases suggests that the revolutionaries 
were flexible, often making considerable 
efforts to win the good will of the United 
States, and that it was the American (and 
in Greece, the British) who reacted with 
the doginatic hostility and cruel violence 
which is supposed to characterize our 
enemies. 

Gitlin identifies several myths which 
surround the history of the Greek civil 
war. They include the ideas that the Greek 
JUel'rillas were fanatic terrorists under 
Stalin's control; that they refused any 
coalition or compromise with other Greek 
poops; and that they began and prolonged 
the civil war, thus denying to Greece 
the benefits of peaceful and progressive 
reform. By marshalling a host of facts 
and judgments (some by British officers 
themselves), Gitlin refutes each myth in 
turn. He further establishes that terror 
was used first and most extensively by the 
British and right-wing Greek forces, and 
that this military attack forced the Greek 
Resistance to transform itself from a 
popular, multi-party movement into a 
defensive, disciplined band with its own 
means of terror. Thus, the British, sup-
ported by the Americans, played a classic 
theme in Cold War history: projecting 
tbe fear of what the enemy might do as a 
l'elponse to Western action as a description 
of what be was actually doing, thus 
iuatifying the attack and generating the 
lllticipated response. 

John Gittings makes a similar case in 
Ida analysis of the origins of China's 
!'Oticy toward the United States and the 
Soviet Union. Standard American 
t history holds that the Chinese Communists 
were inflexibly committed to their role as 
JI'IPpets of Russia; thus the United States 
bad "no choice" but to quarantine the 
IDainland and support Chiang Kai-shek. 
Gittings argues that the Chinese Commu-
lliat policy toward the United States was 
Dot "inevitable," but evolved mainly as a 
reaction to the history of American 
Qploitation and the reality of American 
holtmty. As early as August, 1949, 
Secretary of State Acheson had concluded 
lbat although the Communists bad the 
IUpport of the Chinese people, they were 
'torlting "in the interests of a foreign 
~er," and hence it was only a matter of 
~before the Chinese people would 
hie against the foreign yoke. In any 
Clle. the acid test for the Americans 
..._bow the Communists treated 
~go 
property interests"-a forgone 
CIGIIclusion in a land which had suffered 
lara century under exploitation in the 
lillie of "free trade." The parallels with 
~Â·s 
attitude toward the Bolsheviks 
-obvious. The myth of foreign control, 
~-illusion that the people love only a 
..._enterprise system, the primary 
concern with private property-these 
elements in the American position doomed 
an already very difficult relationship. 

Richard Morrock's "Revolution and 
Intervention in Vietnam" applies the 
analysis sketched by Horowitz and 
developed by Williams to the current war 
in Vietnam. Once again, the evidence is 
interpreted to attack the orthodox liberal 
history and to establish that the United 
States did not enter Vietnam because of a 
mistake, but as a result of a conscious 
definition and calculation of the national 
interest. 

The 1\beral story contains the elements 
first presented by Woodrow Wilson in 
1917-18 and developed in our policies 
toward Greece, China, Guatemala, Cuba 
and the Dominican Republic. Once again 
we are told of a struggling parliamentary 
democracy (Diem), menaced by armed 
terrorists acting in the interests of a 
foreign power. Once again the United 
States aids the beleaguered defender of 
freedom and free enterprise, and then 
regretfully intervenes herself. The war 
goes badly; perhaps our original strategy 
was a mistake. The liberals devote 
themselves to proposing various compro-
mises which would allow President 
Johnson to negotiate this way out. 

Morrock's analysis, based on facts the 
liberals smother and on an historical 
context they ignore, interprets the situation 
very differently. Morrock describes the 
strong Viet Minh position in the South in 
1954, and the widespread abolition of 
landlordism in the Mekong delta which 
bad occured under their power. Supported 
by the United States, Diem attacked the 
Viet Minh and their accomplishments. 
Between 1955 and 1959 Diem generated a 
savage repression of the Viet Minh and 
their sympathizers, complete with 
informers, secret police, mass meetings 
denouncing the enemy and other 
paraphernalia of totalitarianism. At the 
same time, Diem implemented a "land 
reform" plan drawn up by American 
professor Wolf Ladejinsky. The plan 
called for a severe reduction of rents and 
strict limitations on loan interest and 
landholding. Aside from problems of 
enforcement, this superficially pro-
gressive plan suffered from a grave defect: 
under the guise of "regulating" land-
lordism, it was actually re-establishing the 
system. For the Viet Minh had broken the 
old system, and Diem's so-called reforms 
meant "reducing" rents which the Viet 
Minh had abolished, selling land which 
the Viet Minh had given away and 
re-establishing estates which the Viet 
Minh had broken up. 

It should be no surprise that the 
Vietnamese peasants, led by Viet Minh 
cadres, resisted this attempt to undo social 
change in the countryside. The American 
officials who decided to increase aid to 
Diem, and then to intervene with Ameri-
can troops, knew that their goal was to 
crush what was primarily an attempt to 
defend and extend a domestic revolution. 
As in the case of the Russian intervention, 
the myth of "foreign aggression" was 
used to mislead the American people and 
to justify an attack on North Vietnam. 

Far from regarding the long, expensive 
war as a "mistake," the majority of the 
American government and military 
welcomed the opportunity to crush a 
guerrilla movement, destroy the industrial 
capacity of a new communist state, 
frighten China and all potential revolu-
tionaries, and consolidate the American 
hold on the rest of Southeast Asia. Far 
from anxiously searching for a "way out," 
the American government has avoided 
negotiations and has set conditions which 
make negotiations impossible. 

The main condition is simply that there 
should be no communist power in South 
Vietnam, even in those areas which have 
almost never been under the control of 
the Saigon government. For Johnson and 
Rusk, like Wilson and Lansing before 
them, cannot face up to the "awkward 
reality" of communist power. The 
communists are by definition illegitimate, 
because they do not hold American ideas 
about elections and 'private property. 
They are to be treated not as a political 
force, but as outlaws, as "germs" to be 
eradicated from the body politic. Many 
American officials and professors use such 
language, which suggests that "negotia-
tions" can mean only victory on American 
terms. 

The usual liberal response to the 
radical analysis contained in Morrock's 
essay and in most of the Horowitz 
collection is that the United States is not 
opposed to social reform or even to social 
revolution. What we are really opposing 
in Vietnam, the liberals say, is the threat 
of the violent overthrow of the established 
government. In other words, the United 
States stands by its pledge not to interfere 
with the substantive policies of any 
nation, but we will guarantee every 
nation's right to democratic procedure, 
embodied in "fair elections and freedom 
from foreign influence." 

The history of our policy in this century 
indicates that this theory is another 
distorted myth. Lansing claimed to 
oppose the Bolsheviks because they 
violated the democratic process; but this 
chosen defender of democracy was "a 
military dictator backed by loyal disci-
plined troops." We have consistently 
approved, supported and even engineered 
violent political changes which brought 
right-wing governments to power: Greece 
in 1947, Guatemala in 1954, Brazil in 
1964, Santo Domingo in 1965, Greece in 
1967, Vietnam now. We have always 
justified such actions by claiming that it 
was necessary to "restore law and order" 
so that the democratic process could work 
again. In other words, right-wing govern-
ments are always given the benefit of the 
doubt; decades of dictatorship will 
"eventually" yield to democracy. Left-
wing movements are never given such 
grace; they must adhere to the full spec-
trum of American democratic values 
(including free enterprise) or be immedi-
ately branded as a mortal enemy. As our 
role in the 1954 coup in Guatemala shows, 
even an established left-wing government 
with genuine popular support is not 
immune from hostile American attention. 

The essays in Containment and Revolu-
tion undermine the liberal faith in the 
Cold War because they interpret our worst 
"mistakes" as evidence of our real nature. 
The "blunders" are always in one direc-
tion: "misinformation" about left-wing 
movements, massive diplomatic and 
military attack where moderation might 
have led to different and happier results. 
Woodrow Wilson and Senator Taft would 
have been more honest. We are fighting 
communism because our way of life de-
pens on the strength of our free enterprise, 
and on our citizens' knowledge that we 
shall never allow alternative, threatening 
systems to extend themselves without a 
bitter fight. The only remaining questions 
are: does the American social system re-
quire this approach to world affairs? H not,
