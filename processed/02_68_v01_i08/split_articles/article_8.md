The Cold War and America's 
foreign mythology 
by Rand Rosenblatt 
Rand Rosenblatt, a student in th.e Law 
School, has studied at the London School 
of Economics and at Harvard. 
Containment and Revolution, edited by 
David Horowitz, Beacon Press. 
On January 30, 1968, the National Libera-
tion Front launched strong attacks on 
Saigon and thirty-four other major cities 
in South Vietnam, surprising the Ameri-
cans, overpowering the South Vietnamese 
troops and holding key urban positions for 
longer than a week. According to TheN ew 
York Times, the attacks taught "the facts 
of life about the war" to all Americans 
from the President on down. Our govern-
ment's recent claims that we had pacified 
much of th~ country, retrained the Saigon 
army and broken the morale of the enemy 
simply evaporated. Most of the resulting 
criticism in Washington focused on 
strategic mistakes, but some implied a 
much broader concern: that the assump-
tions behind our commitment to fight com-
munism and "subversion," not only in 
Vietnam but all over the world, were 
again being starkly tested. 

The test was familiar because the 
American government has held tight to a 
certain approach to world affairs, and has 
refused to confront a fundamental critic-
ism of our costly and violent policies: that 
these policies derive from long-standing 
mythl> about the history of the twentieth 
century. An analysis of these myths, made 
strikingly relevant by the latest crisis, is 
presented forcefully in a new collection of 
essays, Containment and Revolution, 
edited by David Horowitz. Each essay 
focuses on a specific aspect of the Cold 
War, and each attempts to revise orthodox 
American ideas about the struggle's origin 
and significance. As a whole, the essays 
attack three dominant myths: first, that 
American policy, as embodied in both the 
Cold War and in counter-insurgency 
fighting, is a response .to "foreign aggres-
sion"; second, that our enemies are 
fanatically determined to attack Ameri-
can interests; and third, that the motives 
of our global anti-communism are based 
on a disinterested concern for democracy 
and peaceful progress. 

In attacking the long-accepted myths 
behind our present policy, Horowitz's 
authors join a small group of dissenting 
historians known in the profession as 
"revisionists." Conventional American 
history explained and still explains the 
Cold War as America's response to 
Russian aggression in Eastern Europe. 
During the 1950's and early 1960's a few 
historians, notably William Appleman 
Williams and D. F. Fleming, marshalled 
impressive evidence to show that the 
United States, not the Soviet Union, had 
been the first to repudiate her war-time 
agreements. Christopher Lasch noted in 
a recent article in The New York Times 
Magazine (January 14, 1968) that the 
academic establishment effectively 
smothered this critical work for years, 
thereby lending its own detached and 
scholarly support to the Cold War. But 
the Vietnam war has given our past a new 
urgency; the treatment of disturbing 
historical questions is finally beginning 
to move from left-wing journals into 
Foreign Affairs and The New York Times. 

Horowitz's collection repudiates ortho-
dox history and political science in method 
as well as in interpretation. Implicitly it 
rejects the theory, quite popular among 
"policy-oriented" professors, that deci-
sions can be understood only in terms 
of the details of administrative practice-
the kinds of information the President 
receives, whom he has to "persuade," and 
so on. While these factors ioftuence the 
details of the decision, they say nothing 
about the policy-maker's own beliefs and 
ideas, how he came to have them and how 
these ideas affect his reaction to events 
from "the outside." To understand how 
government leaders came to hold certain 
·beliefs, and what sign.ificance these beliefs 
have, you have to know something about 
the real forces operating at numerous 
levels of their society and over a long 
period of time. 

Horowitz admits that analyzing the 
Cold War in terms of long-term historical 
development is still a highly unorthodox 
procedure. Most professors of interna-
tional relations are only now painfully 
freeing themselves from the clutches of 
"systems theory" and "game theory," 
which define the Cold War as an abstract 
bargaining contest occurring in an histori-
cal vacuum. Other theorists close to the 
government have used aspects of historical 
analysis to make a limited point. Thus 
Henry Kissinger, Richard Neustadt and 
even W. W. Rostow have criticized the 
weakness of Washington's operational, 
short-term approach to world affairs as the 
result of an historical American bias 
toward technical, engineering and military 
skills rather than political or diplomatic 
skills. But their "critique" is merely a 
proposal to make American political man-
agement of the world more efficient, beg-
ging the question of why we should 
manage the world in this way at all. 

The crucial difference between the 
approach in Horowitz's collection and 
that of the orthodox professors is that 
the professors draw narrow limits around 
the "historical structures" they investigate, 
while Horowitz's contributors do not. 
An analysis of administrative practices, 
diplomatic tradition and political heritage 
is common enough in the universities, but 
most attempts to link these factors to 
economic interests and social structure 
are dismissed as "dogmatic Marxism" or 
"conspiracy theory." Instead, the profes-
sors rely on explanatory concepts, such as 
"the political realm" or "the national 
ethos," which cannot be analyzed except 
in· their own terms. The task undertaken 
in Horowitz's collection-to analyze the 
Cold War in terms of long-range historical 
development-is difficult and not uniformlY 
achieved. But the collection as a whole 
performs two great services: the presenta-
tion of disturbing evidence, and its inter-
pretation in the light of a critical theory 
unbounded by the limits of orthodox 
"permissible explanation." 

The first two essays, by Isaac Deutscher 
and William Appleman Williams, are the 
best in the book. Deutscher's "Myths of 
the Cold War," originally delivered as a 
speech at the Berkeley Teach-In on 
Vietnam in May, 1965, approaches the 
Cold War from a very special point of 
view: that of an historian deeply com-
mitted to the ideals of both socialism and 
freedom. Deutscher explodes the orthodOX 
American explanation of the Cold War 
by making three points. First, the USSR 
was practically prostrate in 1945, with its 
industry and population in shambles. Even 
if Stalin had wished to "conquer" all of 
Europe militarily, he was in no position to 
do so. Second, many top American officials 
knew that there was no real threat of a 
Soviet attack; Kennan held this position 
and opposed NATO from the start, and 
even bard-liners such as James Byrnes, 
John Foster Dulles and James Forrestal 
seemed to understand it at times. 

Deutscher's third point exposes the basic 
hollowness of the American position. }'lot 
only was Stalin not capable of conquering 
Europe or even of substantially aiding 
internal revolutions; he did not want

revolutions to triumph in other countries. 
Considerable evidence shows that the com-
mumsr successes in China and Yugoslavia, 
far from being part of a "world-wide 
conspiracy," occurred in spite of and in 
opposition to Stalin's policies. The failure 
of the popular revolution in Greece, and 
the easy re-establishment of bourgeois 
democracy in much of Western Europe, 
can be explained partly by Stalin's refusal 
to engage in any serious revolutionary 
IUbversion. 

If there was no real threat of Soviet 
attack or Russian-controlled subversion, 
Ylby did American officials unanimously 
act as if there were? Deutscher analyzes 
American policy in terms of fear and 
arrogance: the fear of any revolution, 
Plrticularly a purely internal one, and the 
arrogant belief that capitalism was the 
only "rational" system, and hence the only 
OOe entitled to respect. These two strains 
0!-American policy came together drama-
licaUy in the case of China: 
... when it turns out that even back-
Ward China, the China that the west 
had kicked around and trampled upon 
!or a century, that even backward China 
IS developing its nuclear industry, we 
[are told] that perhaps if a few bombs 
are dropped on China's nuclear instal-
lations, the growth of that giant will be 
properly interrupted at the right time. 
Quite apart from the wickedness, the 
Pn>found inhumanity of such talk ... 
'What a nonsensical illusion it is, that by 
dropping a few bombs you can really 
ltop the industrial growth and moderni-
lation of the greatest nation in the 
lrorld. Once again, arrogance ... and 
lrishful thinking combine to produce 
IOinething that future historians will 
cite as examples of the degeneration 
of the human mind. 

This way of thinking is not confined 
to generals who have staked their careers 
on the efficacy of war as a solution to 
political problems. David N. Rowe, pro-
fessor of political science at Yale, sug-
gested to the House Subcommittee on the 
Far East in February, 1966, that the 
United States buy up all surplus Canadian 
and Australian wheat, so that there would 
be mass starvation in China. These are 
his words: 
Mind you, I am not talking about this 
as a weapon against the Chinese people. 
It will be. But that is only incidental. 
The weapon will be a weapon against 
the Government because the internal 
stability of that country cannot be 
sustained by an unfriendly Government 
in the face of general starvation. 

Nor is Rowe alone among academics in 
expressing such apocalyptic ideas. Noam 
Chomsky's excellent article, "The Respon-
sibility of the Intellectuals" (The New 
York Review of Books, February 23, 
1967), analyzes some implications of Dr. 
Rowe's thought and shows bow widespread 
such ideas are in the social sciences. 
Deutscber·s critique of them is eloquent 
and probably correct in the very long 
run. But in castiagting these ideas as 
arrogant illusions, Deutscher sidesteps 
the key point made by Horowitz in his 
introduction: that American opposition 
to revolutions, however much laced with 
myths and illusions, rests on real forces 
and interests, and that American power, 
even if sent to destroy an enemy who never 
attacked, can do irreparable damage. 

These points are forcefully brought out in 
William Appleman Williams's essay, 
"American Intervention in Russia: 1917-
1920." 

Williams's thesis is that the American 
approach to world affairs was more or less 
"codified" by 1900. Expansionist poli-
ticians and businessmen, educated in a 
generation of laissez-faire capitalism, 
promulgated the "free-market-free-men" 
doctrine: human freedom was to be 
achieved through the operation of free 
markets. Not "Empire and annexation," 
but the "Open Door" became the slogan 
of American foreign policy. Pragmatically, 
the "Open Door" allowed the vast eco-
nomic power of the United States and 
European countries to penetrate under-
developed societies and control them as 
thoroughly, for economic purposes, as 
any overt Empire. Thus Hans Morganthau 
describes our traditional policy toward 
China as one which favors "what you 
might call freedom of competition with 
regard to the exploitation of China." In 
1917, this fundamental American policy, 
a central tenet of-Wilsonian liberalism, was 
confronted with the Bolshevik Revolu-
tion, which challenged both its practice of 
free markets and its central premise, that 
capitalism produced free men. The out-
come of that confrontation, Williams 
argues, was a direct result of the dominant 
American ideology; it also set the terms of 
international relations for the twentieth 
century. 

Within this general framework, Wil-
liams uses three levels of historical analysis 
to explain the American reaction to the 
Russian Revolution. First, he sketches the 
ideological background of the American 
leaders: their commitment to free enter-
prise, their hatred of socialism and their 
conviction that the national interest was 
best served by using government power 
to advance American economic interests. 
On a second level, he shows how the 
orthodox American ideology affected the 
government's perception of the Bolsheviks. 
Wilson's ideals included the right to "self-
determination," but only within the 
limits of free enterprise and constitutional 
government as conceived by the West. 
There was no question of the Bolsheviks' 
hostility to this system. Nor was there 
any question of Washington's hostility to 
the Bolsheviks. Wilson and his Secretary 
of State, Robert Lansing, did not consider, 
even briefly, the possibility of a temporary 
alliance with Lenin, even though there is 
evidence that the Bolsheviks were willing 
to keep up some pressure on Germany on 
the eastern front. Despite important 
military needs in France which made an 
alliance with the Bolsheviks advantageous, 
the only question Wilson considered con-
cerning the Russian Revolution was how 
best to defeat it. 

On a third level, Williams attempts to 
explain specific historical events in terms 
of his general analysis: that the United 
States opposed the Russian Revolution 
primarily because it challenged the prin-
ciple of private property, and hence was 
a threat both to the American concept of 
freedom and to American economic and 
political interests. There is much evidence 
that American policymakers actually 
thought about the Russian Revolution in 
these terms. In early December, 1917, 
Lansing castigated the Bolsheviks as 
"dangerous idealists" who did not believe 
in nationality and private property, and 
then advised Wilson to pursue a policy 
of breaking the Bolsheviks by supporting 
"a military dictatorship backed by loyal 
disciplined troops." 

On the basis of this and similar evidence, 
Williams argues that by December, 1917, 
a few weeks after the Bolshevik Revolu-
tion, Wilson had made a decision to 
oppose the Bolsheviks as social revolu-
tionaries with all the means he could 
spare. Wilson's hesitation over the next 
few months is interpreted as a result of 
his inability to resolve two crucial and 
related problems. The first was a strategic 
question: would direct foreign intervention 
unite the Russian people behind the 
Bolsheviks and thus undermine the very 
aim of the policy, the defeat of the 
revolution? The second was a moral 
dilemma: how could Wilson reconcile 
his deep moral and political aversion to the 
Bolsheviks with his deep commitment to 
the ideal of self-determination? 

The eventual solution found by Wilson 
and his advisers was to create a myth 
which bas influenced official American 
thinking for most of this century. An 
attack on the Bolsheviks meant interfer-
ing in inter-nal Russian affairs and trans-
gressing the right to self-determination; 
to smother these embarrassing problems, 
the American government simply defined 
them away. The Bolsheviks were German 
agents and were trying to impose a foreign 
political domination on the Russian 
people. The presence of various bands of 
Czech and German soldiers in Siberia 
and the existence of supply depots at the 
Arctic ports served as additional flimsy 
pretexts for Allied intervention. Thus 
under both the general war policy against 
Germany, and to protect the Russian right 
to self-determination, Wilson was justified 
in attacking the Bolsheviks. The internal 
revolution, arising out of circumstances 
and doctrine, was presented to the Ameri-
can people as an external"invasion," a 
subtle case of "aggression" to be met with 
the moral and military force of the 
democracies. 

Williams's necessarily brief sketch of 
the actual conferences, dispatches and 
decisions contrasts sharply with the 
detailed account presented in George F. 
Kennan's two-volume history, Soviet-
American Relations 1917-1920, which 
covers the same period and interprets the 
same evidence. Kennan's work gives the 
impression of chaos not only in Russia 
but in Washington as well. Far from 
deciding to oppose the Bolsheviks on any 
grounds, Kennan implies that Wilson was 
drawn into intervention by the force of 
events. Isolated by bad communications 
and by his own maddening uncertainty, 
Wilson left his representatives in Russia to 
act without guidance, and then made his 
own policy in a vacuum. The actual 
decision to intervene was not a conscious 
plan to crush a social revolution, nor was 
the public carefully deceived with 
distorted information. The whole 
situation radiated distortion, and Wilson 
merely followed the path of least 
resistance. 

Lansing and the President were 
partly the victims of misinformation 
... [and] one senses that their 
vulnerability to this information was 
enhanced by the difficult position in 
which they found themselves. For men 
unwilling to face up to the awkward 
reality of Soviet power but desperately 
anxious to find a means of escape from 
the endless importunities of the Allied 
governments and of public opinion 
that they "do something" about Russia, 
the thesis that the Czechs, an Allied 
force, found themselves opposed in 
Siberia by [German forces] came as

the perfect answer to all perplexities. 
It was human-if not entirely 
justifiable-that they should have 
aU owed themselves to be convinced of 
the validity of this thesis, and should 
have sponsored it before the world. 

Kennan's explanation of the decision 
to intervene is based on his deep im-
mersion in the documents and dis-
patches of the period. Unfortunately, 
it reads like an abstract summary of those 
documents, and by simultaneously 
abstracting from them and neglecting 
their historical context, Kennan distorts 
their meaning. Why were Lansing and 
Wilson so unwilling to "face up to" the 
reality of Soviet power? Why were these 
ordinarily shrewd men, successful in 
the rough competition of law and politics, 
so willing to accept unreliable information 
and to believe in the illusion (also dear 
to the hearts of Presidents Truman, 
Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson) that 
the Russian people (among others) 
would arise with a spontaneous feeling of 
anti-communism as soon as the armed 
forces of Western democracy made their 
appearance on the scene? What were the 
ideas of Wilson and Lansing, and how 
did they affect their handling of the 
situation? Kennan hardly touches on 
these matt~s. In his epilogue Kennan 
describes the intervention as one of the 
worst mistakes in American diplomatic 
history. But his explanation of this 
colossal failure is curiously unsatisfying: 
"the deficiencies of the American political 
system," the "hysteria of militancy" of 
World War I America, the "congenital 
shallowness" of official Washington's 
approach to world policy. All of these 
"explanations" raise more questions than 
they answer, and none casts any light on 
why the American government ignored 
a whole spectrum of possibilities and 
concentrated, with a single-minded if 
badly organized purpose, on giving effect 
to its hostility to the Bolshevik regime. 

The effect of Williams's analysis is to 
extend the historical framework of the 
Cold War and the war in Vietnam much 
further back in time than most historians 
would consider relevant. In Williams's 
terms, America's commitment to suppress 
social revolutions in the name of freedom 
was not first made in 1947 with the 
announcement of the Truman Doctrine 
and aid to Greece. It began, rather, with 
Wilson's decision to intervene in Russia, 
which implicitly accepted "anti-Bolshe-
vism" as a valid principle of American 
foreign policy: that we had a right, or at 
least a duty, to crush political movements 
whose principles did not agree with our 
own. Internationally we made the first 
step in adopting a policy of "permanent 
counter-revolution," and in doing so 
reinforced the dangerous American 
tendency to equate freedom with similarity 
to the United States, and to define Utopia 
as a linear projection of the status quo. 

The facts in Williams's short essay do 
not "prove" his broad explanatory theory. 
Many are ambiguous, and a search of 
primary sources suggests that on many 
issues, Kennan's picture of enormous 
confusion and misinformation is more 
nearly correct than Williams's implication 
of hard-headed calculation. But the 
ambiguity and confusion do not "disprove" 
Williams's theory either-they simply 
suggest that many actors in the day-to-day 
events did not have their ideology con-
sciously in mind. The broad historical 
context of their actions, traced by Williams 
through quick sketches of economic, 
political and cultural developments, is 
crucial to any significant explanation. 
His essay provocatively adds a dimension 
to historical analysis which avoids the 
arbitrary and the abstract, and helps us to 
understand the origins of a painfully 
consistent American approach to world 
affairs. 

The next five essays in the collection 
trace the details of the evolution of Ameri-
can policy through the Second World 
War, the civil wars in Greece and China, 
and the war in Vietnam. One essay departs 
from the general theme of international 
conflict to look at an aspect of American 
domestic politics: Senator Taft's "conser-
vative critique'' of the early Cold War 
program. 

John Bagguley's "The World War and 
the Cold War;· like Deutscher's essay, is 
dedicated to destroying the myth of 
Russian aggression in Eastern Europe 
after World War II. He argues that the 
Soviet Union bore the brunt of the fighting 
throughout the war, and thus earned 
the right to a sphere of influence in 
Eastern Europe in the same way that the 
United States earned undisputed hege-
mony in the Pacific. The United States 
and Britain recognized Russia's right as 
late as October, 1944, when Churchill 
negotiated his famous "percentage 
partition" of the Balkans. Stalin honored 
the agreement, giving Britain a free hand 
to crush the left-wing Greek resistance 
movement. But after President Roosevelt's 
death, the "hard-liners" in Washington 
and London mounted a strong diplomatic 
attack to deprive the Soviet Union of its 
assigned share. 

Unfortunately, Bagguley neglects the 
larger historical framework which 
Williams used in analyzing Wilson's 
intervention, and which Horowitz set 
forth as the unorthodox approach of the 
collection. Bagguley's investigation of 
war-time policies is a substantial piece of 
historical research, and it would be unfair 
to criticize him for not covering American 
decision-making as well. But be does 
advance an explanation of why the 
United States launched its diplomatic 
attack on Soviet interests: that we wanted 
to deprive Russia of her slice of the pie, 
and that we used the rhetoric of "no 
spheres of influence" to serve that end. 
The metaphor of three men quarreling 
over the spoils may be a fair summary of 
much of this history, but it leaves too 
many problems unresolved. Like Kennan's 
explanation that Wilson "bad to do some-
thing" about the Bolsheviks, it begs the 
question of why the Americans felt 
threatened by Russia, and why the "some-
thing," in Wilson's case, was military 
intervention, or. in Truman's case, diplo-
matic attack. 

A similar failing is apparent in Henry 
W. Berger's "A Conservative Critique of 
Containment: Senator Taft on the Early 
Cold War Program." Taft opposed parts 
of Truman's policy because be did not 
share the government's ill-founded fear 
of imminent Soviet attack, and because he 
wanted to avoid the heavy taxes on Ameri-
can free enterprise required by expensive 
government programs. But he, like 
Truman, identified freedom with free 
enterprise, and emphatically included 
both in his conception of the national 
interest. Thus he supported the Marshall 
Plan as an altruistic gift in the American 
tradition, and also because it "might help 
us in the battle against Communism." 
There is nothing in the evidence Berger
