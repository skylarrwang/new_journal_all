The Yale Citizens for McCarthy com-
mittee has begun working for a New 
Haven primary. Undergraduate and 
graduate groups have joined, or are try-
ing to create, organizations in 12 of New 
Haven's 33 wards. They are conducting a 
preliminary poll to determine the depth 
of potential support for the McCarthy 
drive to oppose a unanimous Johnson 
convention. Although no one in Con-
necticut can remember a similar develop-
ment, the election law provides the 
opportunity to challenge the town com-
mittee's slate of state convention nominees 
with a signed petition of five per cent of 
the party's registered voters. The state 
convention selects national convention 
delegates. In New Haven, five per cent 
would be about 1300 signatures, and 
McCarthy supporters seem confident of 
their ability to force a primary, which 
would be held on April 9. The question 
now, they say, is how much beyond that 
five per cent they will be able to go, and 
whether they can in the space of two 
months build an organization capable of 
in any way challenging Arthur Barbieri's 
strong Democratic machine. The New 
Haven McCarthy for President Committee 
is counting on Yale for a great deal of help 
in the next two months, and the Yale 
committee, headed by Jim Woolsey, is try-
ing to meet their needs. An office has been 
set up in Room 16 in Pierson College, and 
each undergraduate college has its own 
group working more or less autonomously 
in a specific ward. Smaller groups are also 
traveling to New Hampshire on weekends, 
and a large registration drive will begin 
shortly for graduate students and new 
faculty. The only names that can now be 
added to the primary Jist are those of new 
or transferred registrants.
