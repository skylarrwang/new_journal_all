member of the history department, Leon-
bard's doubts increased. Thoughts once 
buried deep in his unconscious began to 
emerge: the arrest of his mother, the terror 
of the purges, the arrests of his teachers, 
the criticism at the Comintern School 
and, above all, the demands and needs 
of the German people that were being 
sacrificed for the sake of Soviet policy. 
Western literature had little effect on 
Leonhard or other communists. Often 
imprecise, Western newspapers maligned 
what even communists in doubt held 
sacred. However, one article in Neue 
Zeitung, the American paper in Germany, 
injected new doubts. Leonhard could not 
attack the article, which described Stalin-
ism as the antithesis of Marxism and the 
present USSR as a betrayal of the October 
Revolution. Yugoslavia's break with the 
Soviet Union on June 29, 1948, completed 
the long chain of events that led to 
Leonhard's break with Soviet commun-
ism. The Cominform (Communist In-
formation Bureau of the Soviet Union) 
published a manifesto accusing Tito of 
Trotskyism. Up until that time Tito 
himself had been weeding out Trotskyites 
from the party, and the charge seemed 
utterly groundless. As Leonhard plodded 
through each accusation, he became more 
iafwiated. The accusations stemmed not 
from Trotskyism or capitalism but from 
tbe attempt of a communist country to 
pursue a policy independent of the Soviet 
Union. 

Yugoslavia replied with a point by 
point refutation of the Cominform state-
ment. To Leonhard the refusal to "admit 
errors" was a repudiation of the servile 
criticism system upon which Stalinism 
rested. 

The SED dealt the coup de grace to 
Leonhard's alignment with the party when 
it passed a resolution condemning Yugo-
slavia and reaffirming the necessity of 
German adherence to the Soviet example. 
The party denounced the theory of a 
Jeparate road to communism. 

For the first time Leonhard thought 
leriously about leaving Germany. He 
COUld share these thoughts with only one 
J)enon: his mother. In August, 1948, after 
twelve years of imprisonment in the Soviet 
COncentration and prisoner-of-war camps, 
lbearrived in East Germany. Leonhard, 
who had been trying to obtain her release 
for years, received word of her arrival by 
telegram. After overcoming their separa-
tions of time and experience, Leonhard re-
vealed his plans to escape to Yugoslavia. 
His mother decided that she too must 
escape. 

Leonhard's attachment to Yugoslavia 
did not go unnoticed. The bulletin board 
~the Party Academy carried a criticism 
Ill November questioning his loyalties and 
asking him to take a stand on the question 
Of Yugoslavia. Little time remained. Al-
lbouah extremely careful, Leonhard talked 
toone person too many about Yugoslavia, 
IOd one spring day in 1949 the director of 
tbe Party Academy ordered Leonhard to 
l"eport for criticism.

l..eoobard walked slowly out of the 
~ 
building and back to his room. In 
~utes he packed a few items into an 
lllconspicuous briefcase and left in a 
chauffeur-driven Party car. The word on 
Leonhard had obviously not yet filtered 
down to the lower echelons. After a call 
to his mother he made the long-planned 
call that procured a car which took him 
to the border between the Soviet Zone 
and Czechoslovakia. The journey across 
the border had to be made on foot, and 
an experienced guide waited to lead him 
on the four-kilometer hike. Posing as a 
Czech, Leonhard then traveled by sled 
to the train for Podmokly, where a con-
tact supposedly awaited him. No one 
met him there, so he decided to travel to 
Prague on.his own. Arriving at 10:30 p.m., 
Leonhard went to the house where he had 
planned to go if the Podmokly contact 
failed. He knocked on the door. No one 
answered. Desperate, he decided to go 
back to the train station rather then risk 
waiting in this unpopulated area. He 
racked his brain for a relevant teaching 
of the Comintern School, but no solution 
appeared. He could only risk everything 
by trusting a total stranger at the train 
station. He picked the right stranger: a 
Czechoslovak communist, sympathetic 
to Tito. Leonhard slept at the Czech's 
home; the next day he made the contacts 
that had previously failed. 

On March 25, 1949, Wolfgang Leon-
hard arrived in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. 
A few weeks later, Radio Belgrade 
broadcast in twelve languages Leonhard's 
condemnation of the Cominform resolu-
tion and his praise of Yugoslavia's break. 
The defection of such an important party 
figure forced the SED to take decisive 
action. Four days after the broadcast, on 
April26, 1949, the German Communist 
Party officially expelled Wolfgang Leon-
hard. The Politburo announced that 
Leonhard had been connected with the 
Yugoslav military mission and had there-
fore indirectly served American capitalist 
interests. All faculty at the Karl Marx 
Academy repeatedly met to practice 
criticism and self-criticism, denouncing 
Leonhard and blaming themselves for not 
discovering his deviance sooner. One 
lecturer delivered a special lecture on 
the "Leonhard Case." 

Leonhard spent the next year writing 
two booklets on Yugoslav communism 
and broadcasting over Radio Belgrade. 
In May, 1950, Leonhard met the leader 
of this communist country free of the in-
human, bureaucratic qualities of Stalinism. 
The afternoon spent with Tito in his 
garden discussing ideological problems 
of communism remains deeply embedded 
in Leonhard's memory. Until their meet-
ing, Leonhard knew only leaders of the 
Stalinist mold. Tito had a vast library 
filled not only with political works but also 
with plays, poetry and fiction, all quite 
different from the party manuals that lined 
Walter Ulbricht's office. Tito di~played a 
remarkable sense of humor, in contrast 
to Ulbricht's humorless espousal of 
straight party decisions. 

Tito reflected reform communism, an 
attempt to free communist ideology from 
dogJDatism, return to the humanism of 
Marx and look at the problems of our 
times from this starting point. 

Leonhard left Yugoslavia for West 
Germany in November, 1950, not for 
political reasons, but to write and speak 
in his native language. He did not defect 
to the West, nor did his standard of living 
improve. In fact it fell drastically. Earning 
just enough money to live by working in 
a publishing office, and living in a one-
room cubicle, he did not adjust easily to
