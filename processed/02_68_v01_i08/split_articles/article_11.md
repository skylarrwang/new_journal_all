Letters 
to the Editors: 
'be advertisement in support of Coffin's 
ltand on Vietnam which appeared in the 
laltissue of The New Journal (February 4, 
~)was, I suppose, intended to bring 
~~~der to the conclusion that we 
:-uadn't be in Vietnam. It is hard to 
~how 
anyone could possibly think 
-•Uch an article could have any effect 
~verona rational human being; 
f!dnk this statement could refer to all 
~brought up against government 
talicy by our mob of liberals . 

In building up the image of inhuman, 
lilllaloraJ conduct in the war in Vietnam, 
these critics of course miss the entire point. 
War will always be essentially immoral; 
in the heat of battle on the personal level 
it would take a saint to react only ration-
ally. It is no real news that atrocities are 
committed every day in Vietnam; it takes 
only a nodding acquaintance with human 
nature to realize this fact. I agree with the 
article that work can be done to improve 
the situation. Perhaps people from the 
Yale community who are concerned with 
this problem can enter the service and 
bring about a minor revolution in policy. 

Then again, however, some people 
don't think we should be in Vietnam. 
They don't seem to see that the immature 
communism of China and North Vietnam 
may be a real threat to our way of life. 
Have they ever documented their opinions 
with facts or special knowledge? If they do 
have such proof in support of their at-
titudes, why don't they voice it, rather than 
appealing to the emotions, concentrating 
on such peripheral (though important) 
matters as the atrocities committed in 
Vietnam? 

If indeed this is all they are really 
complaining about, wouldn't it be better 
to encourage young men of the Yale 
community to bring more reason into this 
war by enlisting as officers, rather than 
influence them to resist? One would hope 
that our liberals are capable of presenting 
some rational arguments for their opinions 
in the future.
