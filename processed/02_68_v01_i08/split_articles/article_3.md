"Have you seen Henry IV?" is the question 
I cannot answer after leaving the Yale 
Drama School's latest production. I am 
not sure I have seen Pirandello's play, but 
I am certain I have seen Kenneth Haigh. 
I have seen him move with astounding and 
chaotic energy through a kaleidoscopic 
range of moods, expressions, vocal tones, 
shifts in pace, physical postures and psy-
chological attitudes. He plays the madman 
with superb frenzy, pushing us into amaze-
ment and embarrassed confusion at the 
unpredictable, puppet-like contortions of 
a personality gone to pieces, a man frag-
mented by the impulse to live out three 
different lives: the historical, fixed life of 
an eleventh-century emperor; the lost and 
irretrievable life of his youth; the present 
and unbearable life of a graying, frustrated 
man. A lunatic mannikin at one end of 
the scale, a bitter philosopher at the other, 
a frustrated and vengeful lover somewhere 
in between, Haigh shuttles erratically back 
and forth from one point of the spectrum 
to another, marking his lightning-like 
shifts with changes in posture, voice, 
facial expression, even the focus of his 
eyes. The effect is dizzying, unnerving, 
wildly comic and pathetic by turns, and 
overwhelmingly grotesque. It is not unlike 
the effect of the insane antics of Peter 
Brook's actors in his production of Weiss's 
Maratl Sade; and perhaps it is close to the 
sort of thrill the Elizabethans experienced 
when they visited insane asylums for 
amusement. Close, perhaps, but never 
quite the same. For in the Yale Theatre we 
never forget that this madman is an actor, 
this figure is Kenneth Haigh. The 
pyrotechnics of his performing style seem 
to light up not the deep psychological 
recesses of the nameless man who has 
decided to persevere in the costume role 
of Henry IV, but the virtuoso skill of the 
actor playing that actor. Can a star per-
former be "too good" for the good of the 
play? Can virtuoso acting distract from 
that which is acted? Can style and form 
obscure content? These are questions that 
Pirandello himself was fond of asking, 
questions be himself posed explicitly in 
his experimental trilogy of "the theatre in 
the theatre," of which Six Characters in 
Search of An Author is best known. The 
Yale production of Henry IV poses them 
anew. 


Haigh's portrayal of the central role is 
in keeping with the entire production's 
elaboration of a characteristic Pirandellian 
habit: superimposing the comic mask on 
the tragic mask. The elaboration pushes 
the manic and farcical dimensions of this
