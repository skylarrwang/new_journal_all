Comrade Leonhard had 
defected .... 
by Jonathan Lear 
When in 1925 Lenin's widow, K.rupskaya, 
saw that the Fourteenth Party Congress 
was packed with Stalin's flunkies, she 
feared that the rule of a single strong man 
would violate communist ideology. 
Stalin dealt with her simply; he said, 
"If you don't shut up, I will appoint 
another widow for Lenin." 
While the students who had filled the 
large lecture auditorium for History 
63b were laughing at the anecdote, Wolf-
gang Leonhard pulled out a cigarette from 
his right inside coat pocket and, from his 
left pocket, a cigarette holder. The stu-
dents, quieting down, watched and waited; 
slowly Leonhard fit the cigarette into its 
holder and then, with the audience now 
perfectly silent, resumed his discussion 
of how Stalin corrupted early communist 
ideology. 

For Leonhard, who returned to Yale this 
semester after a two-year break, the history 
of Stalin is in part a carefully researched 
and clearly analyzed piece of scholarship, 
reflecting the standards one would expect 
of a leading student of communism. But 
the history of communism means some-
thing more to Leonhard, for it has to do in 
a fundamental way with his own private 
history. 

Leonhard is an intellectual, and it is 
interesting to note that decisive changes 
in his life frequently arose from lectures. 
Perhaps the most decisive of all was a 
lecture that he was scheduled to deliver 
but never did almost two decades ago. 
The failure was the result of Stalin's cor-
ruptions and the discrepancy they revealed 
between the ideology and the practice of 
communism. 

On March 15, 1949, students were wait-
ing, notebooks open, in the large lecture 
hall of the Karl Marx Academy of the 
German Communist Party for Comrade 
Leonhard to deliver his talk on the pre-
World War I workers' movement. But no 
Comrade Leonhard strode into this room. 
Students shuffled their notebooks, and the 
suspicions of faculty members began to 
rise. 

A check was hastily made. There could 
be no further doubt; Comrade Wolfgang 
Leonhard bad defected from East 
Germany. But to where? There was 
nothing in the West Berlin press. A few 
weeks later the answer came, but in a 
broadcast from Radio Belgrade; Wolfgang 
Leonhard had defected to Yugoslavia, 
to a communist state not under Stalin's 
sway. 

While there had already been a number 
of East German defections, Leonhard 
was the first Soviet-educated official to 
escape. Most defectors had fled to the 
West; Leonhard has chosen another form 
of communism. 

In the spring of 1935, Leonhard's 
mother, a member of the German Com-
munist Party, fled from the Gestapo into 
Sweden. Once safely settled, she offered 
her 13-year-old son Wolfgang the choice 
of emigrating to England or to the Soviet 
· Union. A member of the Young Pioneers 
since age 11, Leonhard had no hesitation 
in choosing the Soviet Union. 

Arriving in Moscow, Leonhard and his 
mother settled in a furnished room at 
26 Gorky Street. In September. 1935, 
Leonhard entered the Karl Liebnecht 
School for German students and soon 
became a Soviet Young Pioneer. The 
Young Pioneers taught Leonhard to jud' 
similar events differently, depending on 
their context. A rise in prices in a capitali!t 
country reflected the exploitation of the 
workers, but a rise in Soviet prices was a 
contribution to the establishment of 
socialism. 

In the summer of 1936, the summer 
when the great purges began, Leonhard 
left his mother and went to live in Chil-
dren's Home No. 6, a privileged home 
for children of Austrian emigres. When 
he left for school be did not realize it 
would be the last time he would live with 
his mother. One October day they walked 
together to a candy store near the N ikitskj 
Gate. Since Leonhard was having a little 
trouble doing homework in technical· 
drawing, his mother promised to help 
him when she visited the next day. At the 
appointed time Leonhard arrived, but 
waited alone. After half an hour, be 
went to her little room near the Nikitsky 
Gate, thinking that she might be ill. No 
one came to the locked door. Neighbors 
told the 14-year-old Leonhard that his 
mother had left on an assignment. 

The curriculum of the school radically 
changed in the next few weeks. Men who 1 
had been held up as examples of the rev-
olution now emerged as anti-Soviet 
Trotskyites. While vacationing with his 
( 
school shortly after exams, Leonhard 
received a postcard that revealed his 
mother's fate. Inscribed "K.R.T.D.-5 
years," the card reported that his mother 
had been arrested and convicted of 
"counter-revolutionary Trotskyite 
activity." 

Leonhard was unable to reconcile his 
vacationing in the Crimea with his 
mother's imprisonment in a concentratiOO 
camp near the Arctic Circle; he withdreW 
from the group's excursion. 

Back in Moscow in August, 1937, and 
n_ow attending a Russian school, Leonhard 
saw the mass arrests spread through all 
levels of Soviet society. In school one daY 
the lecturer, leaving the main hall, noticed 
two men who were obviously from the 
NKVD. 

"They've come to get you, Karl," joked 
one student to the teacher. 

"You shouldn't joke about such things: 
you know very well that in the Soviet 
. 
Union innocent people are never arrested. 
said the teacher. 


The two men approached, asked the 
teacher his name and then said to him, 
"You are under arrest. We are representJ-
tives of the NKVD." While this would 
have shocked students only a year earlie! 
by March, 1938, they accepted it alroos! 
indifferently. 

Wolfgang and his classmates vacationed 
at Yeysk on the Sea of Azov in the s~ 
of 19 3 9. The mass arrests and the reign 
\ 
of NKVD terror bad terminated as 
abruptly as it had begun. One day J..,eOit 
hard's political tutor, Igor Speransky, 
excitedly called all his students together~ 
He had been in town that day and fidset. 
nervously with the proof of the next daYs 
newspaper. Speransky dumbfounded all 
the politically aware students as he read 
in solemn tones that Russia had siglled 1 
non-aggression pact with Germany. 

"Ah, what a pity," said Egon Dirn-
bacher, the youngest of the students.~

bdp noticing how the alliance with Ger-
IDIDY bad changed the curriculum. A year 
•tier the most significant event in 
luisian history was Alexander Nevsky's 
clefeat of the Teutonic Knights in 1242. 
Now it did not receive so much as paren-
theticaJ mention, and in its place Peter 
lbe Great's formation of the Prussian 
State in 1701 was emphasized as the 
foundation of the Russian-German 
alliance. 

After a year's preparation spent in 
studying Marx, Engels and Lenin, Leon-
bard applied for membership in the 
Komsomol, the Communist Youth 
• 
I.Aque. At an earlier time, his mother's 
lll'elt by the NK.VD would surely have 
aduded the possibility of membership, 
bat by autumn, 1939, it was not held 
qainst him. Apparently the members of 
lbe Komsomol maintained the same 
mental separation between ideology and 
everyday personal events as Leonhard. 
They justified the purges as an abstract 
hiltorical necessity, to which some in-
DOCent people would have to be sacrificed. 

A hush of astonishment fell over the 
lecture hall of German emigre students 
11 they listened to their lecturer on that 
Monday evening in June, 1941. For a 
JeW now Leonhard and all other German 
lbldents in Moscow had been required to 
llteod special political lectures on Monday 
Mnings. But this lecture seemed quite 
different. The speaker said that the char-
acter of the war might change drastically. 
Trained to pounce on the slightest in-
lluendo, students knew there had been no 
IDelltion of this in Pravda. This speech 
portended grave alteration. The speaker 
WU Walter Ulbricht. Six days later Nazi 
lloops invaded the Soviet Union. 

During this week Leonhard and his 
hllow students feverishly prepared for 
IDal examinations. On the morning of 
' Juoe 22 most students awoke at 4 a.m. to 
II 
cnm in a few extra hours study before the 
&d 
...._Working on the assumption that a 
IDOd night's sleep helps more than study, 
IJ 
Leoabard planned to get IJP around 9 in 
~ 
1IMI morning. The commotion made sleep 
ibpossible. Leonhard awoke to banging 
:d 
Oil his door and to cries, "Molotov is going 
folpeak." All sat around the radio and 
lleUd the Deputy Chairman of the Council 
elf People's Commissars declare war and 
demand victory against "the German 
, '-ist rulers." The word fascist bad not 
beea used for almost two years. 

On August 14 Pravda announced, "A 
few days ago, our troops withdrew from 
Saaoleiisk." This meant that Nazi troops 
-..e near Moscow. The Soviet govern-
.._ decided to send all German emigres 
deep into the Russian interior. After a 
llriea of deportations, Leonhard accident-
IIJ met Walter Ulbricht, who was visiting 
Glrman prisoner-of-war camps outside of 
~nda. Leonhard stayed in Kara-
until a summer day in 1942, when 
~received the following telegram: 

"Comrade Leonhard is to come at once 
loUfL., It was signed "Vilkov." 

l..eoohard didn't know a Vilkov, and 
... 
Uta lay eighteen hundred miles away. 
• ctid know that the Com intern, the 
~organ of international commun-
-. had its base in Ufa, but he couldn't 
~d 
why he had been so mysteri-
lllly IUIDmoned. 

Ia a few weeks the long chain of briefing 
...... ftnally reached its last link, and 
~·;res arrived at the Comintem School, 
in Kushnarenkovo, about 40 miles 
....._of Ufa. Immediately Leonhard 
.... taken to the secretary, who forbade 
him to write letters, to tell any students 
who be was or to say anything about his 
previous life. Leonhard adopted the name 
"Linden" and joined the German group, 
which turned out to be a reunion with 
many of his childhood friends from 
Children's Home No. 6. When he met his 
best friend, Helmut Gennys, they could 
only exchange aliases. 

One boy in Leonhard's dormitory re-
fused to take the secretive procedures too 
seriously. He had lost an arm fighting at 
the front, and told his classmates all about 
it, contrary to rules. Yet he seemed to be 
the only one allowed to break rules. 

Zharko, as be was called, always occupied 
the center of attention with his cheerful 
flaunting of authority. Later be revealed 
his identity as the son of Tito. 

After a rigorous morning's exercise, 
students spent the rest of the day and 
night in seminars and lectures on political 
theory and practice. Leonhard learned 
how to compose a "politically correct" 
pamphlet quickly on any subject pre-
sented. His teacher, Klassner, would argue 
a tight case for Nazi ideology, and the 
students would try to refute it. Roles would 
then be reversed. Leonhard learned to 
print propaganda leaflets by any clan-
destine technique from photo-offset to 
hand-molded clay. 

At this time, Leonhard first encountered 
"criticism and self-criticism"-a brutalized 
form of the T-groups now popular in 
American psychology-when be stuck up 
for a younger friend who was being 
bullied by another student. The next day 
the German director, Klassner, called all 
three students to his office. Leonhard 
thought he would serve merely as witness, 
verifying the facts, but Klassner directed 
a flow of cold, unemotional criticism 
against Leonhard. Struck by the accusa-
tions of betraying Bolshevism and the 
Revolution, Leonhard hardly noticed his 
fellow students entering to testify against 
him. One girl recounted statements Leon-
hard had made almost every day since 
his arrival. After she testified that on 
October 6 Comrade Leonhard said the 
Spanish girls were very pretty, Klassner 
spoke of the revolutions that failed over 
love. For hours Klassner blew up every 
trivial statement into serious anti-revolu-
tionary sentiments, while Leonhard sat 
numbed. 

At last the director of the entire Com-
intern School, Mikhailov, called upon 
Leonhard to speak. Students pounced 
upon his weakly stammered confession 
as insincere, superficial and unbecoming 
a Bolshevik. With no decision reached, the 
meeting ended. Leonhard spent the night 
awake in bed with the strongest feelings 
of impotence he ever experienced. 

The next day Klassner instituted another 
session of criticism and self-criticism, in 
which each student had to deliver a speech 
condemning Leonhard. Again no decision 
was reached. Had these psychological bar-
rages led him down the path toward 
redemption, Leonhard could well hav~ 
been molded totally into a cog in the 
Stalinist machine. 

By May, 1943, word spread among the 
students that they would soon take their 
final examinations. But two weeks later 
a new excitement relegated all these to the 
past: a decree of the Presidium dissolved · 
the Com intern. 

The Comintem, heart of international 
communism, existed no longer. Mikhailov, 
the director of the Cornintem School, im-
mediately justified the action to the stu-
dents as fundamental to communist theory 
and emphatically denied rumors of its 
being a concession to Britain and America. 
Students like Leonhard remembered 
Stalin's oath over Lenin's grave--"We 
swear to you, Comrade Lenin, that we will 
not spare our lives in our efforts to 
strengthen and extend the league of work-
ers of the whole world, the Communist 
International." They bad their doubts. 

Leonhard spent the next few weeks in 
Ufa with twelve others on a special assign-
ment of putting the Comintern archives 
ip order. In sorting out material from the 
American Communist Party his eye fell 
upon an article, "Rakovsky's Surrender," 
by Leon Trotsky. "I didn't believe my 
eyes," said Leonhard. "For the first time in 
my life I saw a Trotskyite newspaper. I 
couldn't have been more startled. Even at 
the Comintern School where we could read 
bourgeois and even fascist literature, one 
thing was always prohibited: Trotskyite 
literature." 

After a year away, Leonhard returned to 
Moscow, a graduate of the Comintern 
School in July, 1943. Installed in the 
elegant Hotel Lux, the former residence 
of the highest Comintern officials and now 
the home of Institute-205, the secret 
successor to the Comintern, Leonhard 
began to work on the newspaper Free 
Germany. 

All editorials derived from the highest 
authorities, and therefore an editorial 
proof advocating an armistice with Ger-
many in September, 1943, no doubt sur-
prised Leonhard. This editorial con-
tradicted the previous policy of demanding 
complete surrender of the Nazi regime. 
The editorial had passed two proofreadings 
and the final make-up when the editor 
deleted it. A number of years later Leon-
hard learned that in September, 1943, the 
Soviet Union had sent out peace feelers 
to Germany. When the editor destroyed 
the proof, he destroyed the only printed 
evidence that hinted at that possibility. 

The Red Army began to push forward; 
when it reached the German border in 
August, 1944, 150 prominent German 
emigres met in the Moscow Committee 
of the Party building. Walter Ulbricht 
spoke of a new Germany, and these men 
spent the next year in preparation for the 
return to their homeland and the building 
of the new government. 

An American Douglas aircraft in an 
airport outside of Moscow waited to take 
the first 10 German emigres, known as the 
"Ulbricht Group," into Germany. When 
Leonhard boarded this plane at the end 
of April, 1945, only Ulbricht knew the 
ultimate destination or the mission of the 
group. After landing in German territory 
held by the Russian army, the group drove 
two hours to Bruchmiihle, the political 
center of General Zhukov's army. 

On the day the Wehrmacht capitulated 
in Berlin, May 2, 1945, the Ulbricht group 
began to recruit a new city government. 
Wolfgang Leonhard, age 23, needed to 
find a new mayor of Berlin-Wilmersdorf. 
Mayors, by Ulbricht's order, had to be 
bourgeois anti-fascists, while the deputy 
mayor and men in charge of personnel 
and education should be members of the 
Communist Party. In this way a seemingly 
democratic government would remain 
under communist control. Said Ulbricht, 
"It's got to look democratic, but we must 
have everything in our control." Finding 
bourgeois mayors proved a difficult task, 
and many a Russian commandant would 
walk down the street and, seeing a face 
that struck his fancy, appoint him mayor. 

Just before the British occupation of 
Charlottenburg, a few senior officials asked 
Leonhard to join them in a special mission 
to Berlin Radio. Party authorities believed 
tapes of Molotov's conversations in 
Berlin in 1940 to be buried in secret 
archives, and Leonhard had to recover 
them before the British did. When they 
arrived at the station, the tapes had already 
been seized; not by the British, but by 
the Soviet NKVD. 

Establishing the ideological basis of the 
German Communist Party required a 
tremendous output of pamphlets and 
propaganda, and Leonhard became an 
official in the Propaganda Department of 
the Central Comittee (Agit-prop). 

One evening while meeting with his 
censor and superior, Anton Ackerman, 
Leonhard discovered a fundamental 
change in Party policy. Ackerman spoke 
excitedly of the possibility of developing an 
independent road to socialism in Germany. 
He argued that Germany in 1945 could 
follow a peaceful path to socialism with-
out regard to the Russian example.
