of the pregnant woman. Roraback, 
who argued the case, contended that 
without such funding, the poor no 
longer have access to 
abortion 
facilities. The practical consequence, 
she said, 
is that they lose their 
constitutional right to privacy. 
As opponents of abortion welcome 
Webster as an opportunity to enact 
restrictive legislation, abortion rights 
advocates are seeking to preserve the 
right to privacy through a counter-
offensive of their own. Jepsen and State 
Sen. Richard Blumenthal are trying to 
repeal old statutes criminalizing 
abortion in case the Supreme Court 
overturns Roe v. 
Wade. Although a 
federal 
court rul_ed these 
statutes 
unconstitutional in 1972, they remain 
on the books. 
.Jepsen and Bh.iritenthal, moreover, 
want to preserve specific elements of 
Roe through new legislation, including 
a proposal preventing the state from 
restricting a woman's right to an 
abortion during the first two trimesters 
of her pregnancy. "Our legislation is in 
anticipation of what is highly likely," 
says Jepsen. "Our goal is to preserve 
the status quo." 
If in Griswold the Supreme Court 
allowed for a "broad" right to privacy, 
in Webster it substantially narrowed 
the scope of that right. Webster's 
encouragement of state regulation erodes 
the right to privacy guaranteed by Roe 
and Griswold. It theoretically threatens 
not only Roe, but Griswold itself. 
.Just how far DeZinno, Nania and 
other opponents of abortion will be 
able to push restrictive legislation and 
still 
pass constitutional scrutiny 
remains 
to be 
seen. 
Yet the 
significance of the decision, 
says 
Nania, is clear: "Webster is the 
beginning of a legal u-turn."
