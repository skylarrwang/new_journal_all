This summer the Yale Week~ Bulletin 
and Calendar announced in a front-page 
article that Harry Frankfurt had been 
appointed to a prestigious chair, as the 
.John M. Schiff Professor of Philo· 
sophy. A few weeks later, Frankfurt 
announced that he was taking a job at 
Princeton . 

Although department 
members say they knew that Frankfurt 
was considering the offer from 
Princeton even before President Benno 
Schmidt appointed him to the post, to 
the rest of the Yale community the 
news came as a shock. Frankfurt 
presided over Yale's philosophy 
department as its chairman from 1978 
to 1987. "From the point of view of 
prestige, this comes as a big blow to the 
department," said Carol Freedman, a 
fourth-year graduate student. 

Frankfurt's departure is the latest 
development in the saga of a depart· 
ment struggling to overcome its 
troubled reputation and to heal some 
old wounds. 

In December, 1987, a New York 
Times 
article pitted 
two 
Yale 
professors, John Smith and Ruth 
Marcus, against each other in an 
ideological battle. The article focused 
on the split between two schools of 
20th-century philosophy known as the 
continental and analytic traditions, 
with Smith attacking the analysts and 
Marcus defending them. According to 
the Times, a minority community of 
continentalists have been trying to find 
room to practice amid an oppressive 
majority of analysts who control most 
American universities. 

Yale is unique in representing both 
traditions in its philosophy depart· 
ment. Few major universities in the


U.S. teach continental philosophy at 
all. Northwestern and SUNY Stony-
brook are the only schools other than 
Yale with substantial continental 
programs, while the top philosophy 
departments in the country are 
predominantly analytic. "Many 
departments feel that they have to 
make a choice," said Mark Kingwell, a 
~hird-year 
graduate 
student 
in political theory. "They try to be 
good in one school or the other, but not 
both." 

The analytic philosophers, 
who 
practice mostly in the United States 
and Great Britain, emphasize a rigor-
ous logical method and trace their 
roots to Bertrand Russell, Ludwig 
Wittgenstein, and early 20th-century 
logical positivism. The continental 
school, more literary in nature, focuses 
on thinkers such as G.W.F. Hegel, 
Martin Heidegger and Edmund 
Husserl. With its base in Germany and 
France, this latter school has given rise 
to the post-structuralist literary 
criticism that has become popular in 
recent years. In America, a student 
wants to study continental 
philosophers must usually seek them 
out in the literature department. 

Today, however, many professors 
contend that the labels "analytic" and 
"continental" do not tell the whole story. 
Although ten years ago the Yale 
department did reflect a larger rift in 
philosophy, according to Associate 
Professor Georgia Warnke, the field as , 
a whole has changed since then and the 
antagonism seems to have subsided. 
"There was a general impression that 
the New York Times article was out of 
date," Warnke said. Even Marcus and


Smith have softened their posltlons. 
"That dichotomy is much too small," 
Smith said. "You've got so many things 
goi11g on in the American scene, it 
won't do." 

Marcus, for her part, seems to have 
made peace with her former opponent. 
"A philosophy department needs both 
r points of view]," she said. If she 
has 
to 
make 
a 
distinction, 
she 
prefers to differentiate between 
those who do their own philosophy 
and those who study the work of 
others. Still, the people she cites 
as pioneers in philosophy also hap-
pen 
to be considered 
analysts. 
She points to W.V.O. Quine and 
Joiln 
Rawls 
as 
original 
thinkers in the areas of language and 
ethics. "It's one thing to study early 
H eidq~ge r versus later. Heidegger; it's 
another 
address 
philosophical 
problems such as the nature of rules or 
fJut'stjons of language or ethics," she 
said. 

However one chooses to draw the 
lines. Yale's effort to teach more than 
one method of philosophy has met 
mixed reviews. On the one hand, some 
st udt·nts praise the exposure to 
different approaches. 
Grad uate 
student Michael McDuffie, 
for 
one, though primarily a student of 
continental philosophy, welcomes the 
opportunity 
to study 
logic and 
philosophy of language. "In coming to 
Yale," he said, "I was required to study 
some stuff outside my own tradition 
and 
I 
found 
it 
interesting and 
productive." Some students even make 
drastic changes in their course of 
study. "I've seen students come here to 
study existentialism and they wind up 
studying logic," Smith said. 

But other undergraduates complain 
of the lack of guidance in choosing 
<·ourses, and say they feel confused 
trying to study both traditions. Stan 
Paik (BK '90) said that while the 
plethora of choices can be exciting, it 
can also be bewildering. P rofessors do 
not make explicit the d ifference in the 
two approaches to beginning students, 
claiming that 
to understand the 
difference thoroughly would require a 
substantial philosophical background.
