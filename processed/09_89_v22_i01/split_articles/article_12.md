"What really bothers me," Erin says, 
·'are the Orthodox Jews who use this 
principle to ... " Smiling at her 
dissatisfaction, she describes people 
she knows in Baltimore. David and I 
listen; we tap our index fingers in our 
books, ready to return to learning the 
details of keeping kosher. The others, 
though, start arguing with Stories, then 
with feeling: "Who ever heard of such a 
thing?" They negotiate compromises 
over the reading, returning to it 
faithfully, only to jump away again 
into their own experiences. Not until 
after class do David and I settle our 
questions. 


I still find it a bit bewildering to see 
academic thinking shoved aside in the 
classroom. David and I prepare for 
class as a pair, foxholed together, face 
to face. Learning at Machon Pardes, 
a yeshiva in Jerusalem, means being 
together in the study hall, being 
together in the classroom. We don't 
write papers, we talk. David and 
I- both feeling the weight of being 
beginners- try to drive through these 
texts as hard as we can so we can 
absorb. and know. 


Pardes' program is based on torah 
lishmah, study for its own sake. "In any 
institution where such a principled 
devotion to knowledge for its own sake 
prevails," explained President Benno 
Schmidt when I entered Yale two years 
ago, "truth ... will claim the highest 
value." At Pardes, we struggle in the 
classroom from 8 to 6, but not for 
truth. Our talk is about our daily 
carryings-on, our behavior. And 
though Pardes unquestionably empha-
sizes the classroom- in his intro-
ductory speech, the director reassured 
us that the study hall is the real 
world- we are connected to the world 
of public action and human 
implication. As "an integral part of our 
studies," Pardes mandates that each 
student 
participate weekly in a 
community service project. 


Shoshana is seventy years old and 
has four grown kids and I visit her once 
a week. We talk, mostly about children 


Shoshana minds two babies, Gilad 
and Shalevet. Childhood is the time, 
explain the biologists, that we learn the 
adaptive behaviour used by the adults 
of the species. Gilad is learning to talk 
and so am I, a baby that pays the rent 
and takes a university seminar in 
science and modern political theory. 
Tea and cookies with Shoshana is 
just a piece of the world, an oppor-
tunity to participate in the social 
fabric. Our afternoons repel analysis; 
we cannot think alike. We share only 
these bare hours of involvement. Even 
when I left Pardes ·in the middle of the 
year, I arranged my work schedule so I 
could continue seeing Shoshana. 


"Education," insists Schmidt, "is not 
for career but for life. A liberal 
education enhances our capacities for 
community, 
for affiliation, 
for 
empathy," he says. Wrestling in a Yale 
classroom, though, no matter how 
vigorous, 
revolves around dispas-
sionate analysis and tends toward crisp 
detachment. Classroom talk soaks in 
the written word; whether talking 
about fiction or a research article, we 
dissect, connect, elaborate, interpret. 
Human implications, however, get 
shunted away. 


Kingman Brewster, in his inaugural 
speech for the Yale presidency in 1963, 
called for pulling students out of the 
classroom. He worried that students 
were withering in the university, losing 
their enthusiasm in 
a 
lockstep 
march to credentials. He urged a new 
strategy: students needed to go beyond 
Yale's gates, to go out there to "splice 
experience with learning." 


In the fall of 1965, Yale established 
the Five-Year B.A. Program, which 
annually sent a dozen students away 
from Yale, to work for a year in a 
different · culture. Brewster did not 
trust the educational process to 
produce leaders with real perspective. 
Being out in the field (or in the 
bush-many went to Africa), these 
Program participants would realize 
that public service had to be hands-on, 
and would be "deterred from pursuing 
post-baccalaureate degrees." 


"What happened," recalls William 
Foltz, the program's director until its 
demise in 1971, "is that students felt 
that to understand the scenes of 
poverty before their eyes in Africa, 
they needed to go to graduate school to 
understand the banking system. 
"Kingman never stopped laughing 
at how naive he was about that." 


Brewster hoped to reorient students' 
priorities. Even in the ideal Yale, even 
with a searching, wrestling community 
of people with diverse experiences, we 
won't fully learn about either the world 
or ourselves. Active immersion in 
places without students, with people 
like Shoshana, he thought, could 
repair that. With this involvement-
coupled, of course, with Yale's 
education- students might well 
become effective leaders. 


I return hesitantly to the university. 
Pardes and Shoshana have taught me 
to examine the cultures we learn from. 
At Yale, I believe that the classroom 
can unite outside experience with 
academic thinking, that like Erin, we 
can be . stirred by scholarship. From . 
my apartment, though, 
I 
look 
downstairs, 
and 
wonder about 
emotionally pulling back from the 
world of involvement. On the parking 
lot, the kids are playing soccer in the 
morning sun, skipping school.
