thought and crave some clarification.

Paik said. "There's a great deal of room

structure in the department, some 
students feel it is too easy to grad uate 
without working through a cohesive 
program of study. "They take one 
course 
in 
ethics, 
one course in 
philosophy of mind, some bullshit 
here, some bullshit there, and you 
have yourself a major," said J ohn 
Kroger (MC '90). 

Paik also finds it discouraging when 
he tries to cross over between the two 
schools, since an analytic professor 
may not be familiar with problems of 
continental philosophy, or students 
who have studied continental theory 
may be resistant to scientific reason-
ing. "It's a problem if you try to raise a 
logical question in a Hegel seminar," 
he said·. "There are too many different 
languages being spoken." 

Rulon Wells, a member of the Yale 
department 
1945 until his 
retirement last spring, has taught 
courses on Russell and the philosophy 
of language, as well as on myth and the 
history of philosophy. "I've heard 
enemies of the pluralistic conception 
refer to it as a 'zoo' approach," Wells 
said. Still, Wells believes in presentmg 
a variety of approaches to students. 
Moreover, many, such as Mark 
Ravizza,

Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit and 
you had someone like Jonathan Lear 
going to that seminar. You have to be 
ambidextrous today." 

In theory, few Yale professors will 
argue with this tolerant lin.e. But 
historically faculty have split into 
ideological camps when arguing over 
appointments. In th e 1960's, a contin-
ental 
philosopher named Richard 
Bernstein failed to get tenure after 
strong opposition from the analysts at 
Yale. The dispute, which attracted 
attention from the media and sparked 
student protests, left Yale with a 
reputation as a divided department. A 
similar d ispute in the 1970's, over a 
professor named David Carr, led to the 
barring of junior faculty from meetings 
about appointments and tenure deci-
sions. 

If students suspect that an ideolo-
gical rift in the upper echelons of the 
department has contributed to their 
lack of direction, Yale's professors are 
quick to respond that the situation is 
improving, that the department, along 
with the whole philosophical commu-
nity, is becoming more unified. Ever 
since the Bernstein controversy, Lear 
said, undergraduates, professors at 
universities, 
and 
newspaper 
articles have speculated about the rift 
at Yale, even as it continues to heal. 
"There is always some grain of truth 
around which a rumor is built," Lear 
said. "But now it's about ten years out 
of date. Almost every vote all year has
