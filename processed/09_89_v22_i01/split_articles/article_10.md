Ben Doolittle hopes his group will circumvent the bureaucracy of other campus 
organizations. 

Perhaps the most striking aspect of the 
n"w organization 
called College 
Volunteers is its simplicity. "An ape 
coulda thought of it," 
said 
Ben 
Doolittle (ES '91), a founder of the 
){roup. 
"The residential 
college 
volunteer groups are incredibly active 
orl{anizations without the annoying 
formal bureaucracy," he said. Doolittle 
and Don Chen QE '89) founded Col-
lege Volunteers last year as a network 
of community service goups in the 
residential colleges. 


Each group 
consists of leaders at one of the colleges 
and a core of students who sign up for 
various short- and long-term volunteer 
jobs in New Haven. 
College Volunteers does 
dt·mand the same substantial time 
rommitments required by Dwight Hall 
prol{l"ams such as the Yale Hunger 
Action Project. "'College Volunteers 
t•nables people to make commitments 
at their own pace, without committing 
to larger projects which may some-
times be overwhelming," explained 
Chris Roberts (SY '91), who leads a 
'{roup at Saybrook. Lisa Nelson (DC 
'9 l ), who runs the Davenport group, 
believes that this organization makes 
the problems faced by the people of 
New Haven more tangible. "You get 
the feeling that you're doing something 
direct. as opposed to other community 
service projects, where you're just 
sitting at a table with other Yalies 
signing people up for something," she 
said. 


In addition to its simplicity and its 
focus on hands-on experience, College 
Volunteers has the advantage of a non-
partisan image. According to Chen, 
students often avoid volunteer work 
through Dwight Hall for political 
reasons. "It is perceived as being 
e-xtremely liberal," he said. While 
Chen adds that this image of Dwight 
Hall is inaccurate, he believes that it 
fril'{htt•ns ofT potential volunteers who 
hold more conservative views. 


A ({rowing number of students who 
havt· never been involved with Yale's 
other community service projects have 
joined the College Volunteers 
last 
year. 
The organizatio n 
developed from a group which has 
heen in existence at Ezra Stiles for the 
past four years. This group prepared 
and served food on a regular basis at a 
soup kitchen held in the annex of 
Columbus House. In 1987, when 
Doolittle took charge of the group in 
Stiles, he and Chen began discussing the 
rossibilit} of expanding the program 
to include all twelve colleges. Last fall, 
Chen and Doolittle, together with 
Meir Lakein OE '91) and Beth Lin (SY 
'91 ), started contacting people they 
knew would be interested in leading 
volunteer groups. 


Pierson, Davenport and Trumbull 
colleges have combined efforts to 
provide meals for the hungry at the 
Downtown 
Evening Soup Kitchen 
(DESK) every Tuesday evening. Each 
college works on a different part of the 
process, from transporting the food to 
cooking and serving the meals. Morse 
volunteers its services to DESK at the 
Kosher Kitchen on Sunday nights. 
Berkeley 
serves 
a 
breakfast at 
Columbus House weekly. Stiles and 
Silliman also work in the Columbus 
House soup kitchen. At Jonathan 
Edwards, Chen has developed a varied 
volunteer program where members 
devote time to activities such as 
making telephone calls to lobby for 
affordable housing legislation. 


One obstacle the program faces is 
funding. Although Chen says that in 
certain instances college masters have 
given College Council funds to the 
Volunteers, the Council of Masters 
does not officially permit such awards. 
For the most part, college volunteer 
groups have had to raise funds inde-
pendently. By setting up a solicitation 
table outside the Stiles dining hall, for 
example, Doolittle managed to raise 
more than $500 for his group. 


As recipients of the Dwight Hall 
Humanitarian Award, 
Chen and 
Doolittle plan to use the money to give 
the College Volunteers a boost. They 
will give the award to a college group 
which has demonstrated outstanding 
dedication 
to community service, 
Doolittle explained. "Maybe with the 
money we'll be able to plant an up-and-
('oming volunteer group firmly on its 
feet, and bring the ethic of service to 
t>ven more people."
