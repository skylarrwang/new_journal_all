"Fight the Power!" came pounding out 
of a boombox on the floor of the 
Democratic Nominating Convention. 
Three young men carrying "Youth for 
Daniels" signs were leading a long line 
of the mayoral candidate's supporters, 
waving flags withjewish, African, and 
Puerto Rican symbols. About 400 New 
Havencrs squeezed into the steamy 
auditorium 
at Conte School on 
Thursday night, July 27, while on 
stage, members of the Democratic 
Town Committee struggled to address 
the noisy crowd. When the Daniels 
people finally sat down, ·a brass 
band struck up "Happy Days Are 
Here Again," and an older group, 
waving American flags and DeStefano 
placards, took its turn around the 
room. 
John DeStefano won at the con-
vention, 
to carry the party's 
endorsement to the Democratic 
primary this Tuesday, September 12. 
For all practical purposes, the primary 
will mark the end of the mayoral race 
for 
Democratic candidates John 
Daniels and john DeStefano, as well as 
R~publicans Roberta (Robie) Pooley 
and Tobin Hitt. As usual, there is little 
doubt that a Democrat will win in the 
general election (no Republican has 
been mayor here since 1953). But this 
year's campaign has generated a lot of 
excitement. Volunteers have signed up 
close to 3,000 new voters, and New 
Haven has not seen such a split in its 
dominant party since the beginning of 
Mayor Biagio DiLi~to's ten-year reign. 
When 
DiLieto announced last 
spring that he would not run again, he 
left the mayoral seat open for the first

time since 1969, when the legendary 
Dick Lee stepped down after 16 years. 
Daniels · had 
already 
begun his 
campaign, 
cr itizin g 
the 
old 
administration and declaring that it 
was "Time for a Change." DeStefano, 
the city's development administrator 
under DiLieto, entered the race on 
May 
1, 
calling himself "A New 
Gene ration 
o f 
L eadershi p ." 
While New Haven ~taggers under its 
overwhelming 
hui'na n 
crises 
in 
r>overty, AIDS, and crime, the next 
mayor will have to confront the 
immediate 
practical 
problems of 
handling the city's overflow of solid 
waste as the Middletown landfill closes 
in .June, and managing a government 
strarped for funds as its tax base 
shrinks. 
DeStefano, Daniels, and Pooley all 
say the next mayor should concentrate 
more on human services. Except for 
T ohin Hitt, who has said h e would cut 
otr funds to the city's Shubert Theater 
and form special police posses to round 
up prostitutes on Edgewood Avenue, 
the candidates have maintained fairly 
uniform stands on the issues. The two 
Democrats have both proposed recy-
din l.{ and composting programs to deal 
with solid waste, and have said they 
will huild more affordable housing. 
Despite 
their similar 
positions, 
Danids and DeStefa no 
have very 
diO<.·n·nt backgrounds and political 
stylt·s . .John Daniels grew up in the 
Elm Haven public housing projects. A 
high school football hero, he came 
honw after college to begin his 25-year 
r>olitica l 
career 
by running fo r 
aldt'rman. As the first black candidate 
with a good chance of winning, in a 
ritv run by Irish and Italian mayors 
sinn· 1900, he has promised to build a 
coalition of New H aven's diverse racial 
and l'thnic communities. "H e can 
rTarh out to all different neighbor-
hoods and galvanize them to fight the 
human problems of the city," said U.S. 
Congressman Bruce M orrison. The 
latest New Haven Register poll showed 
Daniels had a broad base of support: 
43 percent of the vote versus 24 · 
percent for DeStefano. 
As a state senator, Daniels drafted 
1 he drug bill passed this year which will 
"What happens when 
you have one party 1n 
control is that they 
don't have to account 
to anyone." 
fund treatment, law enforcement and 
cdurat ion programs across the state. 
Alonl.{ with Morrison, he also devel-
opt'cl a project to replace the Elm 
Haven high rises with public housing, 
and cn·ated 
regional 
housing 
compact to promote similar efforts. 
Morrison admires what he calls 
Daniels' conciliatory leadership style. 
Hut Pooley calls h im passive. O ver the 
course of nine years in the state 
h·l.{islature. Daniels has taken very few 
pm\(·rful stands. 
In his campa ign for mayor, Daniels 
has mt·t with members of youth gangs 
: .... well as Yale professors, to discuss 
pmbkms of drugs and crime. "A lot of 
\'Cl\111.{ guy:-
on the street do feel 
comfortable with him. He's someone 
who docs identify with us," said Darell 
Moss. a member of Youth for Daniels. 
''\\'hen I talk about change in this city 
I'nr talking about inclusion," Daniels 
said. "Over the last ten years the party 
nr:whine has completely dominated. 
It's het>n an era when people are 
<"-.:eluded, and neighbor is divided 
al.{ainst neighbor." 
When .John DeStefano talks about 
<'hange. on the other hand, he is 
usua.lly 
talking about municipal 
finan<·e. "If there's discrimination in 
this <"ity it's economic," he said. "I don't 
think 
w<·'re 
torn apart 
racially." 
D1·St<'fano, who began his career in 
1.{0\'l'r·nmcnt as a comptroller and has 
11<'\Tr held elected office, is running on 
his reputation as a detail-conscious 
tl'<"hnocrat. H e describes himself as 
nwtinrlous and demanding. "Some 
rwople have called me difficult, but I 
just 
demand excellence," he said. 
Among 
his 
most 
important 
accomplishments, he lists rescuing the 
Shubert Theater from the brink of 
bankruptcy, building the public library 
on the Green, and leading a project to 
put up homeless shelters in New 
H avcn neighborhoods. 
D<·Stefano's supporters praise his 
hands-on aggressive style. "After six, 
years on the board of aldermen, I 
know the difference between doing the 
job and making the rules," said fo~mer 
aldl'rwoman Judith Baldwin. "We're 
facing a minimum of five years of very 
n·-;t ric ted financial resources to deal
