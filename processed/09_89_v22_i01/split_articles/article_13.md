**Title: Whose Right? The Abortion Debate on the Local Front**

Eleven bills limiting access to abortion 
came before the Connecticut legislature 
last spring- the most in any state. 
These proposals ranged from a 
parental notification requirement to a 
constitutional amendment outlawing 
abortion altogether. Although none of 
the bills passed, the Supreme Court's 
July decision, Webster vs. Reproductive 
Health Services, which upheld Missouri's 
regulations prohibiting abortion in 
public hospitals 
or by public 
employees, will probably help several 
of them become law by next year:. 路 路 


Since 
1821, when Connecticut 
became the first state to criminalize 
abortion, it has been a battleground for 
reproductive rights. 
Griswold v. 
Connecticut, a 1965 Supreme Court 
decision, found an implicit right to 
privacy in the Bill of Rights, which laid 
the groundwork for federally protected 
abortion rights. 


For ten days in November, 1961 
Estelle T. Griswold and C. Lee Buxton 
counseled married couples about birth 
control at a Planned Parenthood 
Center on Trumbull Street. In so 
doing, they violated a state law that 
prohibited using contraceptives and 
providing information about them. 
Their arrest, conviction and 
subsequent appeal to the U.S Supreme 
Court led to the Griswold decision. 


Certain areas of private concern, the 
Court 
ruled , 
such 
as 
"the 
marital bedroom," are protected from 
government intrusion. 


New Haven attorney Catherine 
Roraback, 
who helped prepare 
Griswold and Buxton's defense, has 
been fighting for privacy and abortion 
rights for 30 years. "We didn't expect 
to win on the right to privacy," 
Roraback said of the Griswold case. 
"Really we were arguing that the state 
statute was a denial of liberty and 
property without due process, and a 
violation of freedom of speech. The 
Court was looking for a chance to say 
something rather broad on the right to 
12 The New journal/September 8, 1989 
privacy." 


Roraback felt that Roe v. Wade was 
the logical extension of the right to 
privacy. Today, sixteen years later, 
she believes Webster's sanctioning of 
state regulation endangers that right. 


Following Webster, State Rep. 
Benjamin 
DeZinno 
decided 
to reintroduce a bill that would keep a 
minor 
from 
having an abortion 
without first notifying one of her 
parents. Although the proposal died in 
the Public Health Committee last 
spring, Representative George Jepsen, 
an opponent of such restrictions, now 
believes Webster will help it pass. In 
Connecticut, Jepsen says, "The real 
battleground remains parental noti-
fication, which we路 will probably lose." 


DeZinno's bill is similar to the 
statutes in question in two of the 
abortion cases the Supreme Court will 
hear this fall. DeZinno emphasizes that 
his bill stipulates the minor tell only 
one parent, not both. "This is not to 
deny access," says DeZinno. Rather, 
he describes his bill as a means of 
fostering communication within the 
family and providing an opportunity 
for parental guidance. 


In 1988, State Rep. Anthony Nania 
proposed cutting off state funds which 
support abortion 
or contraceptive 
services to unmarried minors without 
their parents' written consent. "I have a 
right to know if my child is practicing 
contraception, or having an abortion," 
Nania said. 


Yet Roraback believes that the 
true intent of parental notice is not to 
foster communication, but to stop 
women from 
getting abortions. 
Further, she says, the notification 
requirement ignores individual 
circumstances. 
The daughter of 
abusive parents, for instance, has good 
reason not to tell them of her preg-
nancy. 


However, Richard Tulisano, head 
of the State Judiciary Committee, 
believes that parental notice would 
"Our legislation is in 
anticipation of what is 
highly likely. Our goal 
is to preserve the 
status quo." 
.. 
only lead to abuse in rare circum-
stances, and is therefore reasonable. "I 
don't think these exceptional cases 
should rule," he said. Furthermore, he 
says the state's interest in fostering 
familial communication warrants this 
regulation of the right to privacy. 


Tulisano believes that a majority of the 
public-including 'some people who 
identify themselves as "pro-choice"-
support 
some 
regulation 
of 
路abortion. In advocating restrictions 
such as parental notice, he says he is 
seeking a middle ground between those 
who favor abortion on demand and 
those who oppose it unequivocally. 


DeZinno, however, favors restric-
tions as part of a larger anti-abortion 
program. "I am against abortion and 
will do whatever I can to limit it," he 
said. 


Last spring, 
he 
sponsored 
legislation that would have cut off 
public funds to pay for abortions 
except in the case of rape or incest or to 
save the life of the mother. "Ideally, I 
support abortion only to save the life of 
the mother, but I'd accept it in cases of 
rape or incest," he said. "I'm being 
realistic about this issue." 


An attempt to restrict public funding 
is less likely to succeed in Connecticut 
than the parental notice proposal. "We 
won't lose on funding," Jepsen said. 
He points to Doe v. Maher, a 1986 
Connecticut Superior Court case, as a 
barrier to such legislation. The court 
ruled that the state must provide 
Medicaid funding for all abortions, not 
just those necessary to protect the life
