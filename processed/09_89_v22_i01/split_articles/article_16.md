with major problems. I want some-
body in that slot who has the skills and 
practical experience to do the job." As 
mayor, DeStefano plans to relieve 
Nt•w Haven's financial troubles by 
building an "urban coalition" with 
Hartford and Bridgeport, ana pushing 
for a statewide income tax. "The great 
division that exists is not within the 
<·ity," he said. "It's between the city and 
the suburbs. And we're foolish to lose 
si~ht of that." 

DeStefano has also said he will 
restructure 
city bureaucracy, 
to 
t•liminate overlapping and conflicting 
r<·sponsibilities among departments, 
and 
make 
social 
services 
more 
accessible to citizen s. "I will break 
down the barriers that have grown up 
b<-1 ween 
individuals and 
their 
~overnment," he said. 

H istorically, however, much of the 
division between individuals and city 
~ov<· rnment in New Haven grows not 
from an inaccessible bureaucracy but 
from the structure of the city's all-


powerful Democratic party. "What 
happens when you have one party in 
control is that they don't have to 
account to anyone," said Pooley. A 
C'omplacent 
one-party system 
has 
neglected citizens' needs for years, she 
said, leading to many of New Haven's 
current crises. In the last year of the 
DiLicto administration, New Haven 
has left S9 milJion in anti-poverty 
funds unspent, 
besides losing its 
ft·derally-funded Headstart program, 
because of mismanagement. Daniels 
has also lashed out at the city's 
Democratic "machine," which, he said, 
has excluded candidates who represent 
tht· interests of the broader population. 

Ml've been called a machine, 'the 
mustache,' and the leader of a great 
party," Democratic Town Chair 
Arthur Barbieri said in his speech at 
the 
nominating convention . "But

visit." History books on New Haven 
politics have immortalized Barbieri as 
th<· driving force behind the city's old-
style Democratic machine. During his 
20 years as Town Chair from 1953 to 
1973, Barbieri kept a tight grip on the 
party. In that era, characterized by 
hattles between 
Irish and 
Italian 
political "bosses," through deal-making 
and "ward-heeling," Barbieri saw to it 
that 
the party-endorsed 
candidate 
won. This year, after Town Chair 
Vincent Mauro was killed suddenly in 
a car accident, the Town Committee 
a<>ked Barbieri to resume his old post. 

Barbieri presided over the 
Democratic Nominating Convention 
in 1969, when Lee stepped down and 
Daniels made his first bid for mayor. 
DeStefano was only 14 years old at the 
rime. According to Fred Powledge, 
aUihor of Modtl City, a history of New 
Haven 
politics, 
Bart Guida, "the 
machine's choice" won the nomination. 
In his book, Powledge gives a dramatic 
description of the '69 convention:
