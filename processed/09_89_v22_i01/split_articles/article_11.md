Henry Schwab says publicity is key 
for a small publisher. 

Henry Schwab, owner of Book Haven 
on York Street, knows a Jot of profes-
sors in Yale's English department. So 
five years ago, when Schwab started a 
book publishing company named after 
himself, he already had some valuable 
contacts. This year, Henry R. Schwab 
Inc. will put out its first book, the latest 
work of Yale professor Harold Bloom, 
an internationally- known literary 
critic. 


Schwab (MC '63, M.A. '72) met 
Bloom through another friend in the 
English department, Professor John 
Hollander, who frequently comes by 
the store. Bloom soon began to make 
trips to Book Haven too, to check over 
the shelves and discuss literature with 
Schwab. "(Bloom) has always found it 
helpful to come in, browse, ask 
questions and get recommendations," 
Schwab said. During Bloom's visits, 
the two men talked about Schwab's 
dreams of getting into the reprint 
publishing business- putting old, out-
of-print books back on the market. 


When Bloom asked if Schwab were 
interested in publishing one of his own 
works, Schwab gladly accepted the 
offer. 


The book, called The Poetics of 
Influence: New and Selected Criticism, is a 
"Bloom reader." Twelve of the 25 
chapters are journal articles Bloom has 
re-edited for Poetics and one is a 
recently discovered essay. The re-
maining twelve chapters are reprints 
from previous Bloom books. 


As it turned out , finding a book was 
the easy part. Actually publishing 
Poetics became a long and difficult 
process for Schwab. In some cases, 
Schwab said, publishers denied reprint 
rights for proposed chapters, and he 
and Bloom had to revise their plans for 
the book's contents. 


Furthermore, Schwab discovered, 
Bloom's name alone does not sell his 
books. So far, he has sold 700 of 1500 
paperbacks distributed nationwide. In 
spite of the 
fact 
that both 
London Times Literary Supplement and the 
Boston Globe have reviewed Poetics, no 
other periodicals have picked up on the 
new release. In order for a small, new 
outfit like his to market a book, 
Schwab said, it needs more widespread 
attention. "I'm learning still about how 
difficult it is to market a book, even by 
a name author," he said. 


Schwab predicts that he will have an 
even harder time clearing a profit in 
reprint publishing. The demand for 
reprints is low because they lack the 
advertising benefit of reviews, and 
because the original books are still 
available in libraries. He plans to 
improve his sales by specializing in 
critical works in classics and English 
literature, aimed at the university 
market. His working list of titles 
includes works by ten Yale professors, 
many of whom are Book Haven clients. 


Still, Schwab said, financial success 
is secondary to his concern for the 
continued life of. scholarly works. "I 
think it's very worthwhile to have 
available books that aren't the latest 
books in the field ," he said. "Otherwise 
it's almost the same as the bestsellers. 
That's not how anyÂ·field should work."
