Ferrucci as a candidate rather than 
simply promoting Tyson, as expected, 
because Tyson, who is black, posed a 
threat 
to the Italian-dominated 
machine. 
"I supported Frank Logue (an anti-
machine candidate who beat Bart 
Guida in 1973) when DiLieto chal-
lenged him, and I supported the mayor 
when DiLieto became mayor," Daniels 
said. "For the first couple years, 
DiLieto's ideals and visions were 
compatible to mine. But in the last four 
years he began to rely on people like 
DeStefano and Joe Carbonne and I 
became disenchanted. I've felt the 
machine was wrong." 

DeStefano presents himself as aloof 
from the political fray. "Those are old 
battles, and I haven't been in politics 
for very long," he said. While Daniels 
calls DeStefano part of the political 
machine, D eStefano emphasizes that 
he is actually less of a politician than 
Daniels. "I see Daniels as cut out of the 
old way," DeStefano said. "He's the

statesman. I'm a problem-solver. I 
paid my dues differently, and I don't 
see this race as the capstone of a 
25-year 
political 
career." 

Nevertheless, Daniels' partisans 
\ harge that DeStefano has benefitted 
as the "machine's choice" in this 
election. 

According to Daniels, 
Barbieri manipulated delegates' votes 
to ensure that DeStefano won the 
nomination. "It was a typical Barbieri 
convention," Daniels said. "People's 
jobs were threatened, 
and they 
squeezed out 32 votes for DeStefano." 

According to Alderwoman Katie 
Kenney of the First Ward (which 
includes Yale), Barbieri threatened not 
to endorse Ben Liebman, the Ward's 
choice as a delegate to the convention. 
"When we told him we were support-
ing Daniels he went into a tirade," 
Kenney said. "He said he was going to 
appoint someone who would vote for 
DeStefano at the convention, even 
though the Ward had voted to support 
Daniels."
