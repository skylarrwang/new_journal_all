Yale was overwhelming in the fall of 
1969. Before school started everyone 
gave me advice. My cousin, a junior at 
a women's college, said she couldn't 
think of a more exciting place to be; 
"You'll be a pioneer." "Me, a pioneer? 
What did I get myself into?" 

Living in Vanderbilt Hall was frus-
trating, 
isolating 
and occasionally 
amusing. The main entrance had glass

coeducate all 12 c;:olleges right from the 
beginning rather than to create one or 
more women's colleges. The moti-
vation for scattering 250 transfer 
women may have been suspect (a 
response to angry alumni I heard), but 
it was clearly the right decision. The 
change in the female undergraduate 
population from 10% in 1969 to 45% 
in 1989 was made much simpler by 
that important move. (The change was 
later aided by the Yale Corporation's 
removal of the quota on women ad-
• 
mitted in the spring of 1973.) 

That first year the senior class was 
~ still all male, though- some of them 
! curious and some of them outright

doors and a security guard. If the 
building was set up to keep us in or 
other people out, it didn't work, 
though there was a certain degree of 
comfort in having all the freshmen 
women in one location. At least we 
formed a critical mass in Vanderbilt: 
the colleges had very few women. I did 
not realize how pleased I would be with 
the administration's decision 
to 
hostile. Simply going into the college 
dining hall often took a lot of courage. 
Friends at other schools said, "Yale 
must be so exciting with all those 
men!" My response was, "No, I wish 
there were more women." It was a 
sentiment shared by many of my 
friends. During freshman year, buses 
of women came and unloaded every 
weekend. Who wanted to go to a mixer 
filled with "imports?" It wasn't just that 
there weren't eno1,1gh women at Yale. 
The men preferred these women who 
weren't around all the time, every-
wtJere. Most of them were not used to

having women as friends, and they did 
not seem to want us a~ dates either. It 
was a difficult time. 

I was the only woman in several 
classes- the same was true for most of 
my friends-and that was awkward. In 
class we were sometimes asked for the 
female point of view. As if we knew 
what that meant! One woman com-
mented that when she answered a 
question in class people turned to 
stare, "as if the furniture had begun to 
speak." In one class, I felt that the 
professor resented my presence be-
cause she no longer had her roomful of 
"boys." But perhaps the 
female 
professors had a special struggle with 
the "new" Yale, too. I think they may 
have really wanted the women to be 
superstars, so they were most disap-
pointed by average Yale performance. 
After all, Yale women were like Yale
