completing his bachelors degree, he 
plans to study law. "We need the 
help-just like laws to protect people 
... the human being's rights," Xin 
said. "They can arrest you ... without 
any crime because you have said 
something 
not 
satisfied 
by 
the 
government. They can arrest you and 
even cut ofT your whole life." 


In the United States, Xin is trying 
hard to reconcile his sense of public 
responsibility with his private life. "I am 
peaceful. I like making friends. I'm not 
active 
in 
police 
things, 
but this 
movement is about human rights-the 
basic human rights even to be alive, so 
we must fight." Xin attends numerous 
pro-democracy meetings and hopes to 
set up some connection with his friends 
back home, but he has also eased into a 
more private and secure existence 
away from all the media attention. 


While Xin is excited to learn about 
American culture 
by living and 
studying with students at Yale, he 
emphasizes the importance of re-
taining his own cultural identity: "I 
think it is not worthy to throw [away] 
your past to get anc;>ther past. I think 
the better way is you keep your past 
. . . then you can learn from each 
other." To prove his point, Xin quotes 
a Chinese idiom: "Han Tung Xie 
Pu- Imitating the Han Tung people 
in walking." He opens his book of 
Chinese idioms and reads, in a voice 
made hoarse by gas bombs: "A young 
man . . . hearing that people in Han 
Tung . . . walked most gracefully, 
crossed the mountains and rivers to get 
there to learn their walk. He walked 
behind the Han Tung people acting 
the ape . . . but instead of being 
successful even forgot how he had 
walked before. Subsequently, on his 
journey back, he could only crawl all 
the way. Used to describe a person 
who in imitating others loses his own 
originality." 


When contemplating his future, Xin 
is pragmatic. "The most important 
thing is to work, to learn from each 
other," he said. "I hope when I'm 
!luccessful in America, then I can be 
Jofl more help to my country. I wish I 
could go back quickly, but I don't 
believe [I will be able to] so quickly."
