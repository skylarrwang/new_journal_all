Schiavone Realty and Development Corporation will use any legal means 
necessary to retain its vision of the Chapel-College business district. 

On the second floor, above the Union League Caf~ on 
Chapel Street, downtown New Haven merchants from 
the College-Chapel area mingle over wine and cheese. 
Behind them hang photogr~phs and paintings of New 
Haven. White Christmas lights, twined into a large wreath· and two 
small Christmas trees, reflect in the floor-to-ceiling windows facing 
onto the street. Kathryn Garre, public relations representative for 
Schiavone Realty and Development Corporation (SRDC), asks 
everyone to be seated. "Okay, you're going to start seeing people 
putting up the decorations soon-we're getting the same crew as 
last year," she says. ~This is the Holiday Calendar, if you're having 
an event that's not on here, please let me know as soon as possible, 
so we can all coordinate." SRDC and its tenants regularly 
coordinate holiday decorations, as well as maintenance, marketing 
strategies, and sidewalk sales. But on any given day, Schiavone is 
just as likely to summon a lawyer regarding a tenant's lease as to 
call a plumber to ftx a tenant's drain.


SRDC manages most of Chapel Street between College Street 
and High Street, where the nineteenth century facades, 
glittering windows, and brick sidewalks create a world all their 
own. That world owes its existence to the vision of one man, its 
former landlord, property manager, and developer, Joel Schiavone. 
An eccentric, impulsive banjo-player, Schiavone (SM '58) 
organized the New Haven jazz festival for a number of years. He 
has appeared on the Green in a tutu. He never wears socks. For a 
while, he owned the New Haven Nighthawks, a hockey team. 
When the Nighthawks threatened to leave the city, Schiavone 
camped out on top of a building and pledged to stay there until the 
team scared up enough support to stay. New Haven lost the team, 
but not Schiavone. Since the 1970s, Schiavone persevered in his 
efforts to transform New Haven into an ideal college town, 
complete with boutiques, cafes, and an entertainment complex. 


Joel and his wife Craig Schiavone, the current president of 
SRDC, have decried negative press about the downtown area. 
Tenants also express concern that the general public sees their 
district as crime-ridden and financially unstable. The imminent 
departure of Kinko's does not quell such concerns, though 
Schiavone himself is quick to downplay them. "We have things 
closing and opening and moving out all the time," he says. "Chapel 
Street is prime real estate." 

A month ago, the area lured Martha's Millinery away from . 
Branford. The ·owner, Martha Lear, a Manhattan-trained hat 
designer, says, "I came to New Haven to get· into an urban area 
within Connecticut, in a quiet neighborhood." A year ago, jeweler 
Peter Endorf moved from Chapel and Park to join Schiavone's 
block, bringing with him creative ideas to lure out-of-town 
customers into New Haven. At a neighborhood meeting, he 
introduced a guest, the advertising coordinator of Woman 
magazine. She proposed an ad campaign for the merchants that 
would target "29-to-50-year-old upscale professional, suburban, 
affluent Connecticut women." 

The suburban dollar represents the ever-elusive golden ring for 
Schiavone's neighborhood. At the merchants' meeting, Kathryn 
Garre thrilled over the 26,000 audience members expected to pour 
into New Haven over Christmas for the Shubert's Cats. But despite 
the theaters, despite a $2 million dollar tax exemption on the 
Shubert, and five-year tax delayed phase-in on all renovated 
buildings, suburban dollars have fallen short of SRDC's hopes. The 
Shubert remains dark more often than most had hoped. And in 
1992, First Constitution Bank threw another obstacle in 
Schiavone's path. The bank initiated foredosure procedures on 
virtually all of the College-Chapel area buildings. 


New Haven headlines have been heralding Schiavone's 
"downfalls" and "comebacks" since the 1980s. Meanwhile, 
Joel Schiavone says, "We still own the properties." He 
denies that the foreclosure case has meant anything. "First 
Constitution went bankrupt, so now we're partners with the FDIC. 
It's the bank's f .. ult that we've been having problems." Schiavone 
never really left. He's been here fighting for his vision all along, and 
he's left a trail of court records behind him. 

Tenants, even during the court battles, have continued to pay 
their checks to SRDC-FHC. FHC stands for First Hamden
