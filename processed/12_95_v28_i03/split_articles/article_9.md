One of this year's Nobel Prize winners 
in medicine relates stories of his Yale 
grad-school days studying 

I
n the spring of 1969, Eric Wieschaus (GRD '74) boarded a 
bus in his hometown of Birmingham, Alabama to visit the 
East Coast for the first time. He had attended the University 
of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana as an undergraduate, 
and he was now heading to Harvard and Yale to look at their 
graduate programs in biology. Wieschaus arrived in New Haven 
and spent the day talking to professors in Kline Biology Tower on 
Science Hill. 

He boarded the bus again to travel to Cambridge, eager to see 
how Harvard would measure up. But when he arrived, there was 
no one with whom he could speak. Students protesting the 
Vietnam War had taken over the administrative building, 
University Hall. "'The campus was a total mess," remembers 
Wieschaus. "The biology building was closed down. There was no 
faculty there. Some of the faculty's children had been arrested in 
the demonstration." Instead of learning about the possible 
projects with which he could become involved, Wieschaus spent 
the day wandering around, watching the protests, and learning 
about tile politics that shut down many universities, as students 
struggled with the possibilities of the draft. There were teach-ins 
that spring, finals were canceled, students went on strike. "'It was 
great, it was wonderful, it was a really exciting place to be," says 
Wieschaus. "I had this disciplinary thing, though. I said, 'Harvard 
would be a great place to be with all of these politics, but if I 
want to do biology, I should go to New Haven.'" Wieschaus chose 
to attend Yale, where he began his studies of fruit fly embryos 
which recently him won the Nobel Prize in Medicine. 

Weischaus' attempt to avoid political activity proved quite 
futile. While Harvard was returning to relative quiet, the Yale 
campus burst into unprecedented political activity during the 
1969-70 school year. That year the U.S.'s bombing of Cambodia 
and New Haven's Black Panther Trial fueled the fire of campus 
politics. Many students felt it was hard to remain concentrated 
within the ivory towers of the university when the country was 
fighting a war they so vehemently opposed. 

DECEMBER I, 1995 
Kline Biology Tower, where Nobel Prize winner Eric Wieschaus 
spmt many of his Yale days. 

Wieschaus himself feared being called to duty at any point. 
"'By the end of my first year, I wrote to all my professors in the 
graduate school saying I wanted to be more involved in politics, 
and that they would not be seeing me around for a while because 
I was going to go out and work and organize," says Wieschaus. "'I 
got a letter from one of my professors, Frank Ruddle (Hon. MA 
'72). He wrote that he understood how I have these feelings about 
these issues, how this was an important time in my life. He 
believed that you should always work through the system, though. 
That-there is greater good in that work." Many, including 
Wieschaus, found the greater good outside the laboratory, where 
individuals were fighting against an unjust government and war. 
He trained to be a medic. Then Nixon introduced the 
birthday lottery, a political maneuver designed to cut the number 
of people personally affected by, and therefore actively working ' 
against, the draft. Whereas before, anyone could be suddenly 
drafted, now, each birthday was given a number from 1 to 366; 
those with lower numbers would be drafted first. "My number 
was 366," says Wieschaus. "It was the last one to be pulled out of

the fishbowl, so everyone else would have 
had to have been drafted before me. So 
the draft board in Alabama said that it 
wouldn't do anything else about my 
application until they got into higher 
numbers." 

By this point, Wieschaus was 
beginning to find it harder to find 
political activities in which to be involved. 
The political atmosphere began to cool, 
and Wieschaus found himself missing 
biology. He started sneaking back into the 
lab in the evenings to work on a set of 
experiments and gradually, over the course 
of three months, he was back in the lab 
full time. 

Finally, his first significant results 
emerged. Filled with enthusiasm, 
Wieschaus ran out to relate his good news. 
"I saw Frank Ruddle in the hall and I was 
so excited I ran up to him and I said, 'I'm 
going to tell you about, guess what, I got 
this great result, oh my .. .' and he said, 

Eric Wi~schaus in his Princ~ton laboratory. 

'You're still here? I thought you were going 
to be out organizing the anti-draft 
movement.' I think he was a little 
disappointed." 

S 
itting in his office at the peaceful 
Princeton campus, Wieschaus 
reminisces about his grad school 
days. "That was an awesome opening-up 
time in my life," says Wieschaus. His gray 
shaggy hair falls into his eyes, as he speaks 
with animation. His casual blue cotton 
shirt and jeans reflect the laid-hack 
atmosphere of his lab, which is filled with 
drawings of fly embryos, bottles of flies in 
various stages of development, and light 
microscopes. 

On October 9, 1995, Wieschaus was 
told by the Nobel Foundation that he, 
along with Edward B. Lewis of the 
California Institute of Technology and 
Christiane N iisslein-Volhard, director of 
developmental biology at the Max Planck 
Institute in Tubingen, Germany, would be 
awarded. the Nobel Prize in Physiology or 
Medicine. All decisions for the award are 
made in complete secrecy. Those who are 
merely nominated are never notified in 
advance. So when Wieschaus received the 
phone call, he was completely surprised. 
"Of course, it didn't come as a shock to 
me that the other two people got it," he 
says smiling. 

His daughter, Ingrid Schupback (BR 
'97), felt the same shock when she heard 
the news. "I was just waking up when I 
heard my dad's voice on the answering 
machine," she remembers. "He said, 'Tell 
Ingrid she should call home because we 
have something that she would probably 
want to hear about. It isn't any bad news, 
but she should definitely call.' It took a 
long time because all the newspapers were 
calling, and we don't have call waiting." 

Ingrid has been surrounded by fruit 
flies her whole life. Both of her parents are 
biologists who work with flies-their labs 
recently moved to the same floor at 
Princeton. The coffee table in their home 
has a wooden inlay of big fruit flies in the 
middle. Growing up, her parents often 
had to run to the lab at all times of the 
day and night. A common expression in 
the house is "Mom/Dad is going off to 
collect the virgins," because the virgin 
female flies must be removed from contact 
with males so that their offspring's 
heredity can be controlled. Ingrid says, "I 
don't believe my parents could be married 
to anyone else. They need to be able to 
talk to each other about their work. They 
are always discussing biology." 

There is no bitterness in her voice as 
she describes them, though. None of their 
fascination with biology has been forced 
onto her. Ingrid, a comparative literature

major in French and German, wanted to 
find her own niche, away from biology. 
She feels that the ethic her father has 
conveyed to her is to love what she does. 
·He believes that working is a large part of 
what makes you happy. And he is 
genuinely involved in what he does," she 
says. "For him, it is a labor of love." 

J
ust as the political atmosphere of the 
early 1970s was extremely different 
from today's, the world of biology has 
transformed dramatically since Wieschaus 
entered the field. As an undergraduate at 
Notre Dame, Wieschaus had a job in a 
laboratory washing bottles that held flies. 
•1 had already decided that the last thing I 
wanted to do was work on flies," he said. 
Fascinated by developing frog embryos. 
He marveled at the process by which cells 
of different regions of the embryo move to 
become organs with specialized tasks, such 
as muscle or brain. In development, a 
fertilized egg starts as a symmetrical ball of 
equivalent cells dividing rapidly. At the 
16-cell stage, the cells begin to specialize. 
It was understood that by the time the fly 
reaches the larval stage, the cells are fated 
to constitute different parts of the adult 
body. Scientists were able to move these 
preprogrammed regions to make a fly with 
an extra pair of legs or wings. Another fact 
remarkable to scientists was that 
embryonic development is the same in all 
embryos, indicating that there must be 
some overriding set of rules, some 
molecules that must be the same in all 
embryos, regulating that development. 
However, most of these questions had 
been raised in the 1920s, during the 
heyday of the surgical approach to biology 
which lasted until World War II. By the 
1970s, the pervasive feeling was that the

collect the virgins." 
classical period of developmental biology 
had passed. It was unclear how to reach 
new answers. 

When Wieschaus arrived at Yale, he 
was first introduced to fly embryos in Don 
Polson's lab. As developmental biology 
slowed in terms of new approaches, 
genetics was at a critical turning point. 
Both X-rays and chemicals were being 
used to make mutations in the genome, 
but the technique was used to study 
inheritance rather than development. "I 
liked genetics," says Wieschaus. "It's an 
intellectual, very rigorous kind of study 
that has a very attractive abstract 
element." But Wieschaus saw no 
connection between genetics and 
embryology. Wieschaus says, "In my naive 
first-year-grad-student mind, I thought 
two pairs of wings coming off a fly had 
nothing to do with embryos. I didn't even 
know that flies had embryos," he says. 
What flies had to offer this line of research 
was their combination of both a visible 
embryonic stage and access to the animal's 
genetics. 

After two years, Wieschaus switched to 
work with a young assistant professor 
named Walter Garring. Wieschaus left 
New Haven with Garring when the latter 
got a job to organize an institute in Basel, 
Switzerland. He did return to Yale to 
defend his thesis and receive his Ph.D. 
"If you were a young experimenter, 
one of the best things that could happen 
to you was to get a result that no one 
believes," says Wieschaus. "If people care 
enough not to believe it, then it must be 
important." For Wieschaus, this first 
finding was that the embryo is already 
divided into predetermined segments, or 
stripes, of cells. He found that within a 
stripe, cells divide into a leg and a wing,
