New Hoven's effort to make its neighborhoods self-sufficient and efficient rests 
on the foundation of its elementary schools. 
The Family Cam~as 
'' W:exler is a COZI School. Kids & Parents 
Together" boasts a colorful patchwork sign in 
front of the Wexler Elementary School in New 
Haven's Dixwell neighborhood. A bear caJls

incorporating parents into a school's daily routines are concepts 
which form the cornerstone of a new program known as the Family 
Campus Initiative. 

New Haven Mayor John DeStefano, Superintendent Reginald 
Mayo, and Yale President Richard Levin announced, in July 1994, 
the initiative to convert New Haven's neighborhoods into networks 
of safety and support centered on public elementary schools. They 
intend each school to work together with other service 
organizations as a campus to offer educational opportunities and 
support for the entire community. The program currendy exists in 
two of New Haven's neighborhoods and will eventually extend 
throughout the whole city. The Family Campus requires a 
collaborative effort, consisting of a coalition of local foundations, 
Southern Connecticut State University, Yale University, various 
state agencies, neighborhood organizations, and parents. 

The acronym for the basis of the Family Campus Initiative, 
COZI, is constructed from the first syllables of the names of its 
creators, Dr. James Comer (Hon. MA '75), a Morey professor of 
psychology and director of the Child Study Center at Yale, and Dr. 
Edward Zigler (Hon. MA '67), a Sterling professor of psychology 
and director of the Bush Center for Child Development and Social 
Policy at Yale. In a concept that he introduced in 1968, Comer 
advocates the consolidation of resources in the school as well as 
parent involvement in order to improve schools and the quality of 
education. Zigler's "School of the 21st Century" idea argues that 
the more children are supported in schools, the better they will 
perform. 

The COZI concept, already functioning in schools nationwide, 
provides the foundation for the Family Campus Initiative. Whereas 
COZI aims to improve schools specifically, the Family Campus 
Initiative extends to all parts of the community, uniting parents and 
resource providers in its effort to improve the entire community 
through the schools. 

Lynn Conte, who was hired in July as the project's director, is 
rarely in her office. Instead she spends most of her time in the 
community, meeting with parents and residents, keeping them 
involved and informed. "It sounds great on paper, but that's not 
everything," she admits. Katherine Brennan in the West Rock 
neighborhood and Isadore Wexler in Dixwell are the two schools 
where this pilot program is taking place. A steering committee as 
well as advisory groups in the two neighborhoods have been 
formed. Representatives from each neighborhood meet monthly 
with Conte in order to discuss the individual needs of each 
community. Although meetings rarely produce tangible signs of 
progress, Conte, as well as the principals of both schools, seem 
positive and enthusiastic about their effect. 

Belinda Carberry, the principal of the Isadore Wexler school, 
reports that, as a result of discussions held at a retreat in June for , 
teachers and administrators, teachers decided to telephone the 
parents of their students before the school year began. To encourage 
further involvement, they also held a "Back-to-School" picnic for 
faculty, students, and their parents on August 31. 

Fortunately, Dixwell already possesses many funds from a grant 
of $4.5 million earmarked for the renovation of Elm Haven, a 
nearby housing project. In addition to these financial resources, 
Wexler School's location on Dixwell Avenue puts it in a prime spot 
near a church, the Dixwell Q House community center, a small 
supermarket, and a branch of the New Haven Public Library. 
However, Dixwell needs the Family Campus Initiative to organize 
and to direct its funds and resources efficiendy. 

T
he Family Resource Center, a product of Zigler's "School of 
the 21st Century" concept, opened in Wexler School in July 
1994. In addition to providing services for parents, the 
center runs its own programs. In one of these, the "Buddy 
Program," fifth graders chosen for good behavior read stories and 
solve puzzles with preschoolers. The program is intended to give the 
fifth graders a sense of responsibility while providing preschoolers 
with good role models. 

In adult education services, many parents recendy completed a 
series of nutrition classes in collaboration with University of 
Connecticut Extension Services. During the summer, the Center 
hosted Certified Nurse's Aide training; out of the 21 who 
completed the six-week course, ten are now employed in that field. 
GED classes are important for many parents, too, offering the 
chance to earn a high school equivalency diploma and to secure 
bener jobs. 

The resource center's current project focuses on establishing a 
day care center in Wexler for children from birth to age four. Such 
an institution would give parents more free time to further their

education, to pursue careers, or to involve themselves in the school. 
The goal is also to create a healthy, stimulating atmosphere of 
education for children as early as possible, in accordance with 
Zigler's vision. 

Wexler has also adopted Comer's idea of involving parents in 
the school's daily operations. Several Wexler parents, for example, 
have been trained to teach conflict resolution at their "Pride 
Center" for children who have been suspended from school. In this 
way, suspension becomes a productive experience instead of an 
excuse to miss school. Parent volunteers also patrol the school 
grounds to maintain order and respect, conduct after-school 
dismissal, work in the cafeteria, and act as substitute teachers or 
secretaries when necessary. "There have never been so many parents 
in the school, feeling good about it and their relationship to it," 
Carberry explains. 

An obvious conflict arises here. As parents move on to higher 
education and more demanding jobs, they no longer have time to 
spend in the school. "We are losing families," says Ruby Allison, an 
administrator at the Wexler resource center. For Allison, however, it 
is a worthwhile trade-off. The Family Campus Initiative 
administrators want this to be a bottom-up program, gradually 
turned over into the hands of the communities themselves, making 
them self-sufficient as well as efficient. 

he West Rock community is markedly different from 
Dixwell. While the latter is relatively accessible and has 
abundant resources, West Rock, the city's poorest and most 
isolated neighborhood, consists of six secluded public housing 
complexes. A single road connects the community to the rest of the 
city. Public transpottation is so limited that without a car, which 
few people own, there is no way to get around after dark. West 
Rock also lacks necessities such as a supermarket and a library. 

DECEMBER I , 1995 
The high backyard fences of wealthier Harnden residents create 
a barrier between West Rock and its rich neighbor. Years ago, the 
residents of Hamden wanted to erect a wall between the two 
communities, but the division was deemed illegal. Their solution 
lay in the private backyard fences which produce the same effect. 

West Rock's remoteness and lack of resources prompted its 
inclusion as one of the two pilot communities involved in the 
Family Campus Initiative. 

The Katherine Brennan School is the West Rock elementary 
school targeted as a Family Campus Initiative pilot. During the past 
six months, the Family Campus steering commitee has provided 
funds for physical improvements such as new floors, better lighting, 
new roofing, and carpeting. Dietria Wells, the principal, reports 
that "round tables have replaced the old, long ones; round tables are 
more conducive to social behavior." They have trimmed the bushes 
and have removed the dumpsters in front of the building. Although 
these changes are mostly cosmetic, the committee hopes that 
improved physical conditions will create a more positive 
atmosphere in the school. 

Unlike Wexler, the Katherine Brennan School on Wilmott 
Avenue has no resource center, one of the Initiative's basic units. 
The Clarence Rogers building, which once served as an annex, 
housing kindergarten through second grade, has stood vacant across 
the street from Katherine Brennan for many years. The words 
"Terror Dome" are spray-painted across one side of the building. 
The Family Campus Initiative has already hired an architect to 
transform this building from a terror dome into something 
resembling a resource center. 

The plan also includes getting nearby organizations such as the 
West Rock Neighborhood Corporation, the Head Start Program, 
the Housing Authority, and the community-based police sub-
stations to cooperate with the school. Conte reports that the police 
department, for example, is excited to 
connect the sub-stations with the schools.' 
"The level of committment is higher than 
we could have imagined," she says. 
"Unfortunately the pace can sometimes be 
frustrating." 

Planning is currently underway for 
individual police officers to patrol the 
surrounding area and to become involved 
in after-school activities such as sports and 
tutoring. In this way, they hope to build 
safer campuses and instill respect in the 
children. 

While the goals of the Family Campus 
Initiative sound effective, some people are 
skeptical about its plausibility. Sean Garris, 
the director of the Dixwell Q House, says, 
"Too many terms, social service jargon, are 
floating around; there is no dictionary." He 
does not believe that there is any real desire 
to change. "The population is for the most 
part apathetic," he explains. "They don't see 
any of the money behind the lip service, 
and that's why they don't vote." 

After finding funding, a major problem 
will be mobilizing existing resource 
providers. One of Conte's missions is to 
ensure not only that necessary resources are 
available, but also that they are not 
duplicated. Garris doubts whether this will 
work. "Agencies will feel threatened, 
because it will all boil down to jobs," he 
predicts. "Who will keep them and who 
will lose them?"
