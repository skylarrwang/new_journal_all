e-recorded voice bounces off the walls in a booth at the 
WELl Radio Towers Park in Hamden, announcing the 
eginning of the Saturday talk show hosted by "New 
aven's own Weekend Warrior," Roger Vann. Dressed in 
a t-shirt celebrating Black History Month, sneakers, and baseball 
cap, Vann looks more like a college student than a warrior. Yet 
when his cue sounds, Vann takes control of the microphone and 
launches into two hours of the kind of heated discussion that has 
given him the reputation of a fighter among radio talk-show hosts. 
Today's topic-parental responsibility-calls for an interview 
with Melinda Toohous, a spokeswoman for an anti-substance abuse 
organization called New Haven Fighting Back. Toohous is fired up 
about beer companies' use of Halloween symbols in their 
advertising, which she says target a child audience rather than an 
adult one. Vann takes on the topic with a casual air, mingling jokes 
with his more serious commentary. Assailed by a short fit of 
coughing during the interview, Vann quips, "I need to take a drink 
here--but not beer, of course." 

For all its informality, Vann's weekly radio show has become an 
important forum for debate in New Haven, particularly within the 
city's minority communities. It involves its listeners in a search for 
answers to the most difficult questions facing urban New Haven. 
After his interview with Toohous, Vann tackles the issues of legal 
penalties for dealing crack cocaine, prejudice, and the need for 
government-funded activities for teenagers. 
"It is always good to spark debate within your own community 
and not just assume that we all have the same views," says Danielle 
Holley (SY '96), a coordinator of the Yale Black Political Forum, 
and an occasional listener of the "Roger Vann Show." Holley 
praises Vann for his unabashed manner, regardless of the 
controversy he may incite. 

Others share her enthusiasm. "WELl has not had a lot of 
programs that dealt with the minority community" before Vann's 
arrival, says Theodore Brooks, Reverend of the Beulah Heights 
First Pentecostal Church. "Vann brought enlightenment to the 
station." 

Of course, there is no shortage of flamboyant radio 
personalities. Proselytizing over the air waves has become a great 
American pastime. Vann, however, is not your typical radio show 
host. The man using Dave Matthews' "Ants Marching" and War's 
"Low Rider" as lead-in music to his on-air segments is also the 
newly elected president of the Greater New Haven branch of the 
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People 
(NAACP).

n his role as NAACP president, Vann appears in a dress shirt 
and tie. With his stocky build and rounded cheeks, he 
resembles a young man dressed up to impress his father. Gone 
are the baseball cap and tennis shoes, as well as the banter of the 
radio show. His voice drops its playful tone in favor of an attitude 
that is all business. "I envision my mission with the local NAACP 
as a microcosm of what the national organizationÂ·. trying to 
accomplish," Vann explains. "I am trying to revitalize the 
organization and attract younger people." 

Vann exudes confidence, but the challenges he will face in this 
endeavor are far &om trifling. The extreme erosion of New Haven's 
job base in the past 20 years has left much of the city's African-
American community in disarray. The NAACP has struggled to 
maintain a strong footing as its shifting leadership tries to meet the 
demands of an increasingly divided community. 

Five years have passed since William Finnegan's widely-
acclaimed N~ Yorktr piece exposed the grim life of an African-
American teenager in New Haven. The wreckage of New Haven's 
working-class communities that has accompanied economic decline 
is common knowledge. There are fewer and fewer residents, in fact, 
who can remember what it was like before. Reverend Brooks, who 
has lived in New Haven for the past 44 years, recalls a time when 
New Haven's African-American community was limited to the 
Dixwell Avenue area, socially as well as residentially. "During the 
fifties and sixties, Dixwell Avenue was the epitome of black 
culture," says Brooks. He speaks of the constant stream of cars on 
Dixwell Avenue every Saturday afternoon, cruising at speeds that 
allowed their passengers to sec and be seen. 

A$ the African-American community's population grew from 
10,000 in 1950 to an estimated 50,000 in 1990, its members 
8ooded over the boundaries of the Oixwell area to which it had 
once been confined. Simultaneously. a gap between socio-economic 
classes .d 
within the community. Often characterized as 
monolithic, New Haven's African-American community today is in 
fact divided between an established middle class and a growing 
lower class. The lack of jobs and other resources prevents a viable 
solution to this problem. 

"Even for those with an education, there are only surface jobs 
available," says Courtland Seymour Wilson, president of the 
Greater New Haven NAACP in the 60s and 70s and current 
executive director of the Hill Development Corporation. Mustafa 
Abdul-Salaam, executive director of the New Haven Family 
Alliance, says "(African-Americans in New Haven] have no access 
to and control of resources, which are the nexus of any 
community." 

Making use of the resources that do exist is also increasingly 
difficult. Organizations like the NAACP, which have traditionally 
provided leadership within the African-American community, are 
finding it difficult to represent the competing interests of the 
middle class versus the lower class, or the new generation versus the 
old. Wilson explains the problem in simple mathematical terms. 
"How can 1,800 people [NAACP membership in New Haven] 
represent a community of 35,000 or 40,000?" he asks, as if insulted
