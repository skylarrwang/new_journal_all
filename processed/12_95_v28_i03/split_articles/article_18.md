by the very idea. "No organization can do 
that. [The New Haven NAACP] represents 
those who want to participate." 

In the face of such hardships, New 
Haven's NAACP leadership in the 
community has sometimes faltered. Elnora 
Potter, treasurer of the Greater New Haven 
NAACP, says that for brief periods during 
the 1940s, as well as the 1960s and 1970s, 
the chapter lay dormant, overcome by 
divisiveness. Wilson denies this adamantly, 
but he acknowledges that the problems 
faced by the organization have changed 
during the 78 years he has lived in New 
Haven. Describing the explosion in drug 
use and violence that has taken place 
largely in the last ten years, Wilson says "I 
think the NAACP can help, but not with 
[these kinds of] problems. There are new 
problems in America that I don't think any 
organization can handle." 

The dramatic leadership shake-up that 
occurred with the election of 28-year-old 
Vann last year was part of an effon of the 
New Haven NAACP to revitalize its 
chapter, shed its out-dated dogma, and 
find a voice more relevant to today's 
community. 

"Leadership 
of 
the 
organization had been too stable," says 
Vann. "There were deeply ingrained 
attitudes. There was a need on all levels for 
a turnover in leadership and an infusion of .

Mayor and a member of both the current 
and previous executive boards of the New

deciding that the branch needed a turnover 
in leadership. "When you are in an 
organizatio.n for a while, you tend to 
overlook its weaknesses," says Allen, in 
reference to the leadership of five-term 
branch president Hayward Hooks and his 
executive board. "[Vann] was young, 
outside the old regime of the NAACP. He 
could see 
its 
potential and 
shoncomings," Allen says. 

While Vann's youth made him an 
appealing challenger to Hooks, it was 
internal disagreements among chapter 
members that allowed him to win the 
election. Many local NAACP members

perceived this most recent regional conflict 
as an indication of the broader struggle 
surrounding the NAACP's role in today's 
Mrican-American communities, a debate 
over whether the NAACP can affect 
problems such as the ones Wilson 
highlights. Vann entered the scene at a 
time when the NAACP was struggling to 
justify its very existence. "There are 
questions of whether the NAACP is still 
relevant for playing a leadership role in the 
African-American community," Abdul-
Salaam says. "Across the board, the nature 
of organizations for communities can no 
longer function from the top down." 

Holley attributes public questioning of 
the NAACP to t he fact that the 
organization now spans several generations. 
"The role of the NAACP anywhere is in 
flux. It is considered outdated for most 
people. It is very sixties, very much a part 
of the civil rights movement. It is not 
associated with progressive thought," says 
Holley. Many students, she says, consider 
the NAACP part of the past and associate 
it with their parents' generation rather than 
their own. 

Vann acknowledges that when he began 
as president of the New Haven NAACP 
branch, some members were clinging to the 
organization's past while others desired an 
agenda suited to the future. He sees the 
generation gap as a temporary problem, 
however, and not one that need seriously 
compromise the effectiveness of the 
organization. "The NAACP can absolutdy 
be effective today," says Vann. "If people 
think [it can't] why is it that when they get 
in trouble they give us a call to be their 
advocate?" The more serious problem for 
Vann is the organization's lack of 
connection with the grass-roots public. The 
NAACP, says the new president, must 
DEcEMBER I, 1995 
reestablish ties with local grass-roots groups 
and let community members believe that 
the organization is in their hands rather 
than under the control of an amorphous 
national bureaucracy. 

Personally, Vann is well on his way to 
establishing such ties. Whether he can pull 
the NAACP along behind him is another 
question.

n Vann's office, littered with scraps of 
paper and lined with recordings of 
radio shows, one realizes why he might 
have been perceived as nothing more than a 
recent college graduate with his head stuck 
in a cloud of idealism, why people would 
doubt his ability to bridge all of the gaps 
New Haven faces. Yet Vann's history reads 
like a resume of attempts at promoting 
community interaction. Since his youth in 
Hamden, Vann has taken only a temporary 
leave of absence from the New Haven area 
to attend Brown University. As president of 
the Brown's Organization of United 
Mrican Peoples and a leader in a 1985 
Third World Student Protest against 
apartheid, Vann was instrumental in 
student activism for civil rights. Reflecting 
on his college crusades, Vann describes 
them as a training ground where he used 
his newfound freedom to find his political 
and social niche. Post-graduation, Vann 
returned to the New Haven area during 
what he calls a period of "re-grouping" 
prior to attending graduate school. 

Vann, 
however, 
soon 
became 
sidetracked by work at the radio station 
and with local organizations. He initiated 
support systems for Mrican-Americans, 
including the Simba program orchestrated 
through the Oixwell Community Q 
H ouse. Sean Garris of the Q House 
describes the program as an aid for African-

American males experiencing the transition 
from adolescence to adulthood. Vann 
worked to instill a sense of pride in 
Mrican-American youth by incorporating 
his background in African-American 
culture and history into the program's 
activities. "(Vann] gave [the teens] a 
different insight into their responsibilities 
as individuals and .their roles in the future. 
He was even able to get the support of the 
parents of the youth involved," says Garris, 
clearly impressed by Vann's achievement of 
the latter task. 

In a less concrete manner, though 
perhaps a more enduring one, Vann has 
already demonstrated a commitment to 
increasing community involvement 
through his radio show on WELl. "Being 
on air, I have exposure to a more diverse, 
wider audience. The goal is to promote 
productive dialogue among community 
members," says Vann. "We need to figure 
out, why are we so divided on the issues?" 

Mike Morand (SY '87, DN '93), a former 
New Haven alderman who is now assistant 
secretary of Yale University, agrees that 
radio, as one of the most accessible news 
media, provides a crucial link between 
Vann and the public. 

Vann's familiarity with the New Haven 
area allowed him to slide easily from being 
a general member to a position on the 
Greater New Haven NAACP executive 
board. His sense of the city has proven even 
more crucial since his election as president. 
"I don't need to go out and learn an 
entirely new community, and that helps me 
be more effective as a community leader," 
Vann says. Knowledge of his surroundings ' 
was not enough to win an election, 
however. From the beginning, Vann sensed 
he would have to prove that his awareness 
could lead to productive change for the

This whole thing about 
New Haven being a war 
zone is overblown. It's a 
city, folks. Get over it. 
city. In this vein, Vann based his election 
platform on a set of proposals called 
Agenda 2000, a nine-part plan for 
improvements within the African-American 
community. Central issues addressed by the 
plan included violence in the community, 
revival of youth programs, improved voter 
registration and education, desegregation of 
education, and the creation of a more 
positive representation of the NAACP 
through improved public relations. 

Since his election, Vann has brought 
some of his goals to fruition. Potter says 
Vann has followed up on various programs 
that had fallen by the wayside during the 
past several years. She points to the 
reestablishment of the NAACP Youth 
Council, which each NAACP branch must 
create once its under-20-year-old members 
account for a certain percentage of its total 
membership. Vann says the council 
introduces community youth to civil rights 
and allows them to have a semi-
autonomous organization. New Haven's 
version of the council already displays 
movements towards activis~, with recent 
officer elections and current plans to host 
an NAACP Youth Summit in December. 

The Youth Council demonstrates 
Vann's determination to establish 
connections with the younger segment of 
New Haven's population, as do his efforts 
to create NAACP branches at local 
universities. Holley says Vann's willingness 
to 
participate 
in 
Yale 
students' 
conversations about beginning their own 
chapter provides a strong role model for 
student activism. She believes a Yale branch 
of the NAACP could fill a void in the 
Black Student Alliance at Yale, which 
provides forums for local activism and 
debate of national issues, but lacks 
opportunities for national activism.

Yale students are not the only people 
inspired by Vann's leadership. The rapid 
rise in membership, particularly younger 
membership, makes a strong case for Vann's 
appeal to the community. In June of 1994, 
the branch's membership numbered 
approximately I ,600, and most meetings 
netted between ten and 15 members. Six 
months after Vann's term began, 
membership 
had 
increased 
by 
approximately 250. At the first meeting led 
by Vann, 60 faces lined the pews of St. 
Luke's Parish Hall on Whalley Avenue. 
"(Vann] has pumped things up again," says 
Morand, praising the youthful president 
for bringing new life to the chapter. 

In addition to taking steps to bridge 
New Haven's generation gap, Vann has 
begun to attack the . more omin,ous 
economic divisions. In the effort to involve 
more lower-class African-Americans, Vann 
used the NAACP as a vehicle for 
encouraging voter education 
and 
registration. Prior to the recent elections, 
the NAACP staged church-based efforts to 
accomplish this task. Vann enlisted several 
local church ministers, who devoted parts 
of their Sunday services to supporting voter 
participation. Church bulletins contained 
voter registration cards, and registered 
congregates were encouraged to bring the 
cards to unregistered friends or family 
members. Though Vann does not know the 
exact percentage of African-American 
voters who participated in November's 
elections, he feels confident that the 
NAACP contributed to the all-time high 
for voter registration in Connecticut. 

Encouraged by this success, Vann plans to 
expand his cause by approaching public 
housing projects and local schools in the 
future, as well as bringing the program to 
more churches. 

Vann claims that the NAACP is a more 
represenccfrive group than many imagine, 
with several white and Hispanic members 
and African-Americans who range from 
those living in multi-million dollar 
suburban homes to those struggling to pay 
the ten-dollar membership fee. Whether or 
not the organization is already as diverse as 
Vann says, under his leadership it has made 
strides to encourage interaction between aU 
segments of New Haven's communities. 

Public speaking engagements by Vann 
himself are the vanguard in this effort. In 
one recent speech, Vann spoke to a group 
of white students at a middle school in 
Milford and tried to educate them about 
the African-American community. "Some 
people would say, speaking at a school, 
'That's not big,' but we have to win people 
over one by one," says Vann. "If we can 
reach out to young people and mold their

Certainly, Vann has no lack of vision. 
Bringing the vision to reality, however, is a 
task that is far from complete. Even if 
people do not doubt Vann's abilities, they 
are dubious about the impact a single 
leader can have. Wilson says that the 
NAACP, as an organization, can only be 
effective in a limited segment of public 
affairs and must concentrate on issues 
within its scope to provide proof of its 
accomplishments. 

"If [the NAACP] gets outside issues of 
quality of life, jobs, housing, then I don't 
know if it can survive. If they get into aU 
the social problems of America, they don't 
have the resources," says Wilson. Abdul-
Salaam even goes so far as to describe the 
NAACP itself as an obstacle to the broad 
social change sought by Roger Vann. 

"There is a national agenda that the local 
organizations tend to follow," says Abdul-
