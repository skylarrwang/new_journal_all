EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
To the Editor: 
This is in regard to the article "The Tap 
Night Riots" (TN], October 13, 1995) by 
Whiffenpoof/Duke's Man Alex Funk. 
This is written to oppose negative 
implications and a blatant lie in the article 
regarding the Master and Dean of Silliman 
College, Drs. Kelly Brownell and Hugh 
Flick, both of whom were in the Silliman 
courtyard until at least 2 a.m. on Tap Night. 
They were both responsibly refereeing, or 
baby-sitting, if one prefers, the events in 
Silliman that night. They were doing their 
best to prevent any violence or other acts 
which they viewed as undesirable and 
unacceptable. 


Let me make it clear that this is not a 
defens~ of my own actions with respect to 
Tap Night or my reputation jn general 
("arguably the highest-ranking aqua-general 
on Yale's campus," "largely responsible for 
the impressive crowds of nearly 300 gathered 
inside Silliman"). I, confident of the 
intelligence of Yale students, shall let this 
stand as it already does in the mind of the 
Yale Community. This shall. however, 
present a negative view of Mr. Funk's 
journalistic talents. In my opinion, Mr. 
Funk tried to make a largely subjective 
article appear objective by choosing certain 
facts, speculations, and, in one case, lies 
while not including others according to his 
biased view. 


The article claims: "Under the watchful 
eye of Silliman Master Kelly Brownell, 
Daniel has distributed flyers and posters 
inviting Sillimanders to come out and 
defend their college from singers." These 
posters and flyers were distributed without 
prior consultation with Professor Brownell. 
He was completely ignorant of my making 
and posting this publicity. He, in no way, 
direcdy or indirecdy, permitted, promoted, 
or condoned these posters and flyers. 


Besides this outright lie, the article made 
what might be interpreted as negative 
implications regarding the Master and Dean: 
"Hugh Flick is confident that no harm 
can come &om safely played water sports." 
Dean Flick personally made sure that no 
harm came and that the water play was safe. 
This is an understatement by Mr. Funk of 
Dean Flick's actions with respect to Tap 
Night. 


"A member of Something Extra and 
Whim 'n Rhythm called Dean Hugh Flick 
today in hopes that he would somehow 
discourage the pending assault. He has done 
nothing" of the sort." It is not Dean Flick's 
responsibility to discourage the so-called 
assault. Dean Flick took action by 
distributing his Rules of Safe Water Play and 
being present to ensure those rules were 
followed. Had Dean Flick taken a 
discouraging 
role 
as 
this 
singer 
recommended, the water plans would not 
have stopped. The only result his 
discouragement, had it occurred, would have 
had would have been to weaken h1s 
command and authority of the students on 
Tap Night. 


"Kelly Brownell expresses no public 
remorse over the mob scene that took place 
in his college." Without commenting on the 
subjectivity of the term "mob," this sentence 
is ridiculously biased. Kelly Brownell 
publicly expressed no opinion over the 
activities that took place in the Silliman 
courtyard on tap night. That is what an 
obJective article would have said. Instead, 
the author here implies that Kelly Brownell 
should have shown public remorse over the 
event. The article failed to mention that 
Kelly Brownell also showed no public 
commendation, paranoia, affection, thirst, 
pride, extreme mental depression, or 
anything else over Tap Night. 


Thus I defend the actions of Master 
Brownell and Dean Flick on Tap Night in 
Silliman, who were there to promote the 
safety of both the singers and Silliman 
students. Luckily, explicidy due to the efforts 
of Master Brownell and Dean Flick, the 
cheerful singers all excited &om Silliman no 
more hurt than they were upon entrance; 
they were, perhaps, a bit more wet.
