An Illicit Trim 
Haircutting is like prostitution. Well 
okay, it's like that at Yale at least. Not for 
everyone mind you, but many people at 
Yale understand what it is to engage in the 
anonymous endeavor of getting a haircut 
on demand on some random weekday 
afternoon. 


You shove open the front door of some 
characterless 
barbershop. 
(Usually 
something like Harry's or Moe's or 
Phil's ... whatever.) Ding dong! That 
automatic bell at the front door rings, and 
your initial excitement at the prospect of 
finally getting business done turns into 
fear. Geez, you're actually going to have to 
spend time with a face you've never met 
before. 


By now the bell has readied the troops. 
The man or woman at the back of the 
shop, currently engaged in idle chatter, 
comes to attention and yells to the front, 
"What can I do for you?" 


Come on now, you think. We both of 
you know what I walked in for. 
"Uhhh ... just a haircut." 


It's impossible not to be sheepish. I 
mean you barely know this person who is 
about to get intimate with your forehead. 
"Sit over here," they say. They've tread 
this path before and they'll do it again. 


So you sit in the hydraulic chair. Pump, 
pump, pump. You are instantly put on equal 
footing. A snip here. A snip there. The 
barber/hairdresser always knows what you 
want. Just a trim ... about a half inch off the 
top and sides. Just enough to tide you over 
until the next trip home. You have a 
regular at home and you wouldn't want 
some fly-by-night cutter to ruin that 
relationship. Little do you know that you'll 
soon tire of the hairdresser at home and 
dump them for monthly appointments in a 
series of drab New Haven barber shops. 


You never talk to the person furiously 
snipping away at your head. You've tried to 
before, but it never worked out. Neither 
one of you is really all that interested to get 
involved. 


Within 15 minutes you have paid your 
$15 and you're out the door. That 
mysterious stranger you shared the last few 
minutes with wouldn't want you to take up 
too much of his or her precious time. They 
have more young men to cut that day. 
I, at least, usually take the free comb on 
the way out.

**Title: Ulmus Americana**
**Author: Hamsa Murthy**

Ulmus Americana 
Elm trees line the sides of the streets of 
the Elm City, and the buildings and 
students emerge from what seem like 
tunnels of elms. The long, slender, 
perfectly 
columnular 
trunks 
are 
discerp.able, but which upper branch is 
progeny to which trunk is often ~eautifully 
ambiguous. 


There is nothing quite like the 
American elm, old Ulmus americana. 
Nathaniel Hawthorne, that puritanical 
scrivener, could not get enough of them. 
"Our trees 'high over-arched with echoing 
walks between' have the Greater 
resemblance to the Gothic aisle of a 
cathedral." Scarce a tree-lined cathedral 
remains in the old Elm City. But in case 
you were to doubt Hawthorne's elaborate 
similes, flip through late nineteenth and 
early twentieth century photographs ofYale 
and New Haven. 


According to the calculations of a 
neophyte, there are eight American elm 
trees on Old Campus. The elms, most of 
which are between 75 and 95 years old, are 
generally taller than the other Old Campus 
trees. They have high, vase-like silhouettes 
composed of thin branches pointing 
upward or drooping toward the ground. 
The deciduous elm leaves are like imperfect 
footballs, having neatly toothed edges and 
bilateral asymmetry. 


Paul Walgren of Walgren, the Care of 
Trees, in Hamden, has been the godfather 
of Yale's trees for 45 years. According to 
Walgren, many of the elms which 
dominated New Haven have been replaced 
with oaks and other varieties of trees 
during the last 20 years. During the 1950s 
and 1960s Dutch elm disease devastated 
the Yale and New Haven landscapes. Yale 
lost eight to ten trees on Old Campus 
alone. 


According to Walgren, Dutch elm 
disease has been the most severe problem 
for Yale's arboreal resources during the last 
45 years. Dutch elm disease is carried by a 
beetle which chews through the elm tree's 
bark and deposits a fungus in the vascular 
tissue of the tree. The fungus blocks water 
vessels to the upper part of the tree, and 
the tree starves. From May to late August, 
Walgren and members of his staff inspect 
Yale's elms every two weeks for "flags": the 
brown or yellow leaves symptomatic of the 
disease. If the disease remains undetected, a 
90-year-old tree could fall in less than three 
years. But Yale, committed to preserving its 
arboreal heritage, still plants and carefully 
monitors its young American elms. 


As one enters Old Campus, one of 
Yale's tallest elms stands on the right, 
superimposing a spider-web pattern on the 
buildings. And over on Cross Campus, the 
vase-shaped silhouettes are just beginning 
to touch. Old Yale photographs promise to 
be even more familiar in the future.
