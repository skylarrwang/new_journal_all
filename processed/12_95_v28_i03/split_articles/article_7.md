**Title: The Turducken Metaphor**
**Author: The Editors**
**Page number(s): 5**

We're always searching for that perfect metaphor to describe an issue of 
TN]-that one image that encapsulates a cadre of diverse narratives, 
profiles, and witticisms. This December, we turn to that favorite of 
discriminating Thanksgiving diners: the turducken. According to a 
staffer's Aunt Bonnie's interpretation of the renowned chef Paul 
Prudhomme's recipe, the creation of a turducken calls for: 
1 large turkey (boned) 
1 duck (boned) 
1 chicken (boned) 
heaps of 3 different stuffings: sausage, cornbread, and wild rice 
1 hammer 
1 sewing kit 
oven, spices, etc. 
To construct a turducken, first lay open the turkey's body, and fill it 
with sausage stuffing. Then lay the duck on top and cover it with 
cornbread stuffing. Next, place the chicken upon the cornbread stuffing 
and cover it with wild rice stuffing. Finally, sew the whole thing up and 
leave it to cook for 13 hours. If all goes according to plan, you will be left 
with a complete turducken, a bird whose name hints at its mixed heritage. 
Served up, it resembles a bloated, limp turkey. Cut open, it reveals the 
various layers of bird and stuffing, neatly divided. 


The metaphor waxes on ridiculous, bizarre, perhaps even a tad bit 
grotesque-but it's all in the attempt to describe a true labor of love. In 
the cover story for this issue, Gabriel Snyder peels away layers of 
scandalous myth and administrative denial to uncover the ripples of 
heroin use at Yale. Karen Jacobson takes us inside the idiosyncratic mind 
of a onetime Yale graduate student and recent Nobel Prize winner, while 
Hillary Margolis culls from an activist radio personality and NAACP 
leader a vision for the future of Greater New Haven's black community. 
And Michelle Chihara unravels the tangle of legal controversy 
surrounding Schiavone Realty and Development Corporation to evaluate 
tenant-landlord relations in the Chapel Street business district. And if you 
are not satiated by this scrumptious fare, we welcome you down to TNfs 
office at 252 Park Street to help us cook up the next installment.
