Salaam. "It is not enough for an individual 
to want change." 

Undoubtedly, Vann succeeds at 
drawing in a new and younger population 
and re-energizing the long-standing 
members of the organization. "Having 
young Roger Vann as [chapter] president 
makes New Haven an anomaly. The 
NAACP would probably be better 
nationally if we took on more like him," 
says Holley. But even if it manages to get 
its own house in order, New Haven's 
NAACP faces other obstacles to success 
which are much more difficult for it to 
vanquish: the racism and elitism that many 
people see as the roadblocks to true civil 
rights. 


"We are regressing," says Potter of 
American society's efforts to combat such 
issues. "The country has not come to terms 
with the basic problems: racism, 
inadequate housing, lack of jobs, unequal 
education," she says. 

In light of the fact that so little has 
changed, it is difficult to share Vann's 
optimism. He insists that New Haven's 
potential is great, and that the city has not 
sunk as low as some would believe. "This 
whole thing about New Haven being a war 
zone is overblown," Vann responds to a 
jaded caller on his radio show. He 
continues in the jargon that cements his 
appeal to a younger audience. "Having to 
crawl across the street to dodge bullets-
come on, New Haven is a safe place. It's a 
city, folks. Get over it." In a city wrought 
with ambivalence and pessimism, Vann's 
conviction resonates loud and clear 
through the air waves.
