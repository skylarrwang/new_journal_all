To assuage agencies' fears of being 
forced to cut jobs, Family Campus planners 
emphasize a gradual process of organizing 
and consolidating resources in which there 
are no deadlines and no time limits. Alma 
Ayela, the city's human 
resource 
administrator who represents the city's 
involvement at Family Campus Initiative 
meetings, calls for "the on-going process of 
engaging in conversation with residents and 
social 
service 
providers." 
Ayela 
acknowledges the Initiative's responsibility 
to communicate with the institutions it 
affects. "We must pull the agencies onto 
our side by keeping them informed," she 
says. 

Betsy Jenkins, a social services 
coordinator 
at 
the 
West 
Rock 
Neighborhood Corporation, does not feel 
threatened by the initiative. Family 
Campus strives to ensure greater self-
sufficiency for public housing residents by 
building human capital through education 
and job experience. But Jenkins remains 
confident that the need for her services will 
not disappear. "Whatever happens, people 
will keep coming to us since we represent 
the people in the commmunity and offer 
the counselling, food, and energy programs 
that it needs," she says. 

The initiative sets no rigid parameters 
fo r 
Family 
Campus. 
Each 
neighborhood must formulate a plan to 
allocate resources and funds tailored to the 
particular needs and strengths of their 
community. Funds totaling $150,000 have 
already been committed by local 
foun dations. The steering commit tee 
decided to consult local funders before 
seeking national resources, but according to 
Michael Morand (SY '87, DIY '93) in the 
University's Office of the Secretary, "Yale is 
willing to seek federal money if necessary." 
In fact, the committee has already applied 
for funds from several federal grant sources, 
but a number of them have been rejected. 

Cities 
across 
nation 
are 
experimenting with the idea of the Family 
Campus. In San Diego, for example, a 
similar program called New Beginnings 
tries to use schools as centers of service 
integration. In New Jersey, One Stop 
Shopping Schools, which aim to provide a 
multitude of social services in public 
schools, were introduced. These programs 
all try to reduce stress so that families can 
run more smoothly. As Barbara Stern 
(SOM '87) of the Bush Center says, "How 
convenient would it be if the doctor's office 
was in my kids' school?" 

New Haven and the Family Campus 
Initiative are at the forefront of this 
national movement. Confidence in the 
program remains high because of the novel 
partnership of the city, the 
school board, and Yale. As an institution of knowledge and 
experience, Yale is trying to focus its 
energies where they are most needed, 
Morand explains. He anticipates that Yale 
will be more active in Dixwell, while 
Southern Connecticut State University will 
be involved with West Rock. These 
dynamics make sense because of the 
institutions' respective proximities. 

As Ayela describes, the Family Campus 
Initiative is a "conversation" among all the 
elements of a neighborhood. Although on 
the surface meetings deal with bureaucratic 
details, in the best circumstances, they also 
provide a means of communication. The 
initiative negotiates the boundaries berween 
school and family to address the pressing 
problems of New Haven urban life.
