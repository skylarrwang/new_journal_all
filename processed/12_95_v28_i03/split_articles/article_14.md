of bullcrap." 
David imagines the line that most 
students at Yale draw falls just short of 
heroin. "If there's a line anywhere in people's 
minds at Yale when they're drug using, it's 
with heroin," David says. "Heroin is the bad 
boy." 

But as Jeff explains, the people who 
cease to believe the warnings they heard in 
grade school move on to other drugs 
thinking they will be the same. "If you 
finally do end up trying something like 
heroin with that same mindset, you're in for 
a big surprise because heroin is the one that 
will get you in the end because it's highly, 
highly addictive. You know, if you do it 
three days in a row, you're going· to be 
addicted to it because you're going to get 
sick when you stop. That base level of pain-
free existence is taken away and replaced by 
something unnatural you have to purchase 
and give yourself every day. You get literally 
ill, and it's very painful." 

While the image associated with heroin 
might initially draw new users, the intense 
physical sensation sustains them. Zoey 
explains," "How it feels is the key thing to 
the user. Heroin is like the world's electric 
blanket being turned on in your stomach. It 
gives you this curious, queasy, tender 
feeling." Jeff describes the feeling as "when 
you ride down the first hill on a roller 
coaster, that feeling in your stomach. It's like 
that sustained for hours. It's so much, it's 
incredible. It's too much. You know that 
when you feel that fucking good, there's 
something wrong." 

Jeff recalls some people who did not like 
the experience: "I know a couple of people 
who've tried it and didn't like it because it 
does make you vomit." David explains that 
he never took up any of his friend's offers: 
"It seems to me to be disgusting-puking 
and not eating. The whole concept seems to 
me to not be very fun at all." 

After a user is addicted, the extended 
effects disappear, leaving only the initial 
rush. Jeff explains, "When you're addicted to 
it, you're just normal. There is nothing 
different about you and anybody else, except 
that I knew that twice a day I felt really 
good, and the rest of the day I felt normal." 

A large reason an addict continues using is 
to avoid the sickness of withdrawal. "When 
you quit, you get depressed. It feels like a 
bad case of the flu, and you can't sleep well," 
says Zoey. When she first used heroin, Zoey 
loved the experience of it. Now, for her, it 
has become more routine. "What is sad is 
that after a while it turns into daily 
maintenance, and it loses its wonder. I miss 
the innocence of how I entered into it," she 
says. "Heroin becomes routine and it 
becomes ugly." 

For Zoey and Jeff, the drug serves more 
to create motivation than to provide a good 
time. Zoey stresses the little ways the drug 
helps her. "In many ways I am not a 
confident person. Heroin helps me in 
everyday ways like helping me to remember 
to say 'thanks' to the clerk when he gives me 
my change back." Jeff misses that extra help 
in his life. "Now that I'm not doing heroin, 
irs a nightmare. My grades are not as good 
as they were; they're going down. I really try, 
but I just don't have the motivation right 
now. Not that I want to start doing it again, 
but I'm assuming that eventually I'll get over 
this. But, I don't know." 

T
he desire to defy Yale norms serves as 
another source of attraction to 
heroin. Jeff explains, "The thing 
about heroin that attracted me to it so much 
was the whole idea of contradiction. I always 
loved to do the opposite of what people 
would think I would do. The Yalie who's a 
junkie at the same time. Can I do both 
well?" For a while, Jeff tried. "I feel like I've 
experienced Yale in a parallel universe. It is 
so bizarre keeping these weird secrets &om 
everybody at Yale because you feel weird 
having to run home right after a class so that 
you can shoot up and make it through the 
rest of your day. You run back to your room. 
You pull out your spoon, your needle, your 
cotton, and lighter and shoot up and then 
run back out the door. It becomes part of 
your daily routine, and you're a Yale 
student." 

Jeff found his Yale identity useful in 
keeping him out of legal trouble. He tells of 
a time when he and some friends were 
speeding back from New York. "We had just 
finished smoking a blum. We had about ' 
$200 worth of cocaine and heroin in the 
glove compartment, and this cop pulls us 
over." The cop announced that she was 
going to search the car for drugs. Jeff asked 


her, "Why? That's fine by me, but it just 
makes me curious why you would want to 
search us for drugs. We were just visiting 
some friends at Columbia University and 
we're on our way back to Yale." The cop 
then asked them for their licenses, and Jeff 
responded, "I don't have mine, but I have 
my Yale ID, see?" She gave them no more 
than a speeding ticket. 

Though a large part of heroin users at 
Yale buy their heroin in New York, heroin is 
readily available in New Haven. Jeff had 
heard that some dealers marked their spots 
by hanging tennis shoes. When he couldn't 
go to New York, he began exploring New 
Haven. "I started walking around the 
neighborhood by the Med School and then, 
all of a sudden, I looked up and there's 
tennis shoes hanging down from the wires. 
It's really right there." Zoey notes that the 
quality of heroin in New Haven is lower and 
the price is higher, "but it's more convenient 
than going co New York." 

E
ven though it makes che task of 
admissions office recruiters more 
difficult, Yale acknowledges the urban 
crimes to which Yale students fall prey. But, 
the university is less likely co admit that Yale 
students are sometimes guilty of such crimes 
as buying and possessing drugs. To a certain 
extent, the federal government has given 
Yale an incentive to play down drug-related 
activitie~ on-campus. When Congress 
ammended the Drug-Free Schools and · 
Communities Act in 1989, it mandated that 
all schools who receive federal money, 
including Yale, would be held financially 
responsible for enforcing drug laws. Schools 
found co tolerate drug use on-campus would 
face losing their federal funding. So, a 
school has an incentive to downplay the 
amount of drug use on its campus. Critics, 
including Lipsky, argue that the federal 
regulations hamper efforts by schools to 
enact policies that focus on educating 
students who choose to use drugs to use 
them safely. Proponents of these harm 
reduction strategies point to successful "safer 
sex" programs as models. 

Lipsky points out, "The government 
hasn't withheld any funds yet, but colleges 
are waiting for a test case. The common line 
is that the problem here is no worse than at 
any other school." Dean of Student AfFairs 
Betty Trachtenberg disagrees, "The Drug-
Free Schools Ace talks quite a lot about 
education. I don't read it as absolutist. We 
have broadened our education programs co 
include all 
substances." 

However, 
Trachtenberg is also quick to point out that 
drugs do not constitute a major problem at 
Yale. "I'm not going to say there's no use of 
drugs among Yale students, but certainly no 
more than at other schools. I hear the 
rumors that you hear, and I hear rumors 
that heroin use isn't terribly prevalent." 

In a ~ 
of drug use or possession, the 
Executive 
Committee would 
take 
disciplinary action. In the meantime, 
Trachtenberg says that Yale already addresses 
drugs in its educational programs. "Our 
substance abuse counselors at Health 
Services deal with both legal and illegal 
substances," but she adds, "We deal more 
with alcohol because it is much more 
prevalent and much more acceptable." 

David agrees that alcohol is the larger 
problem and characterizes heroin and other 
drugs as "a drop in the bucket compared to 
the number of problems related to alcohol 
on this campus." 

Even though David criticizes Yale for 
not dealing with heroin constructively, he 
emphasizes that the school should not 
conduct a witch hunt for heroin. "I certainly 
don't want to see Yale admit that there's a 
tremendous amount of drug use and then 
crack down on all the drug use," David says. 
"People that have heroin problems should, 
first of all, not be vilified by their friends 
and deans." 

Trachtenberg agrees that disciplinary 
action would not be the most effective route 
to helping people and instead favors 
preventive action. "If we approach this 
through the educational approach, we 
would be much more successful because 
otherwise people will just hide," she says. 

Jeff and Zoey are already hiding. Both 
were concerned with protecting their 
identities and feared reprisals from their 
deans and masters. Jeff and Zoey refer co a 
story of a woman who was confronted by 
her dean last year after the woman's friends 
had told the dean that she had a problem 
with drugs and had been dealing heroin. As 
Jeff and Zoey understand it, the woman was 
threatened with criminal charges of drug 
dealing if she did not enter a rehab program. 
She did not go to rehab, and eventually she 
left Yale. While one may contest the 
circumstances of the case, the story has sent 
a chilling message to heroin users at Yale. 

David feels that Yale must do more to 
establish itself as trustworthy to those who 
have substance abuse problems. "I think that 
there are a lot of people at Yale that feel like 
Yale is their enemy, feel like their dean is 
their enemy, and feel like anything 
institutional or administration-related, in 
terms of their drug use, is their enemy. 
That's a shame because, in fact, addiction is 
a medical problem and that's the way it 
should be treated. There are times when 
somebody is in trouble and the way that you 
deal with it is not by continuing to cover up, 
it's by providing the help and the support 
and the friendship that somebody needs 
when they're in trouble." 

When Rolling Stone published its 
account of heroin use at Yale, the Yale 
community focused on the inaccuracies of 
the report. In her reaction to the article, 
University Secretary Linda Lorimer (LAW 
'77) told' the Daily News, "I would find any 
truth in it to be very alarming." 

The truth is that one Yale srudent has 
died, and on his death certificate the cause 
of death is morphine intoxication. Heroin 
abuse may not be worse at Yale than it is at 
other schools, and heroin may not be that 
widespread on campus. However, the 
number ofYalies who are trying it is at least 
serious, if not frightening.
