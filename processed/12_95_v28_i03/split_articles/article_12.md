Corporation, a subsidiary of First Constitution Bank. Technically, 
banks are barred from investing their own money with their 
customers'; lenders are prohibited from becoming joint partners in 
ventures with recipients of their loans. In 1981, Schiavone needed 
mortgage money to create his downtown vision. First Constitution 
put up that money and created First Hamden Corporation as a way 
of getting around the no-joint-venture rule. The SRDC-FHC 
pannership transformed the neighborhood. 

Everything was fine until the recession in the early 1990s. First 
Constitution suddenly became more concerned with the money 
that Schiavone owed than with the tnoney that Schiavone was 
helping them make. In 1992, First Constitution demanded, in 
writing, that tenants in Schiavone's block pay their rent directly to 
the bank. Schiavone ordered his tenants to continue paying rent 
exclusively to him. Stuck between squabbling landlords, a number 
of the tenants wanted a third party to decide the matter for them. 
The logical choice was a judge; so all parties went to court. 
Attorney Frank Cochran ftled a suit on behalf of the tenants. 
Meanwhile, Schiavone applied in federal court for an order 
appointing SRDC "rent receiver" for the Chapel area buildings. 
"He tried 'to steal a march on the foreclosure case and on the 
tenants," says Cochran. Since Schiavone was the property manager 
and the developer, the court decided in his favor. As rent receiver, 
Schiavone gets a cut of the rent and continues to manage the 
properties. By the time the tenants managed to get partially 
reimbursed for their legal fees, a separate court had already decided 
where their checks would go. Schiavone retains his receivership as 
long as the foreclosure case remains open, which it technically is. 
When the bank folded, the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Company stepped in to shoulder First Constitution's debts. 
Schiavone effectively became the FDIC's partner. Legally, however, 
the situation isn't that simple. FHC (the subsidiary of First 
Constitution) is still on the books in the tax assessor's office and on 
rent checks, and First Constitution is still in the courts. The re-
opened foreclos~;~re case reads as follows: plain tiff, First

FHC, SRDC-FHC, Schiavone Realty and Joel Schiavone-
among others. That 14 parties are now involved in the case gives 
the distinct impression that corporate entities have been 
multiplying between legal motions. 

New Haven's courthouses hold endless lists of cases involving 
one or more of Schiavone's corporate incarnations. Even in 
the federal court records in Hartford, at least eight cases 
come up under Schiavone's name. One claimant who has 
consistently won his cases against Schiavone is Bill McNeiece of 
McNeiece Construction-a longtime business partner and formerly 
a high-ranking employee of Schiavone's. McNeiece sued SRDC for 
breach of his contract for work on the Taft, including remodeling 
The Gap. In the settlement McNeiece was awarded $108,890.80. 
Even Schiavone's ex-wife, Allyn Schiavone, has sued Schiavone. She 
foreclosed on property of Schiavone's in the prestigious Thimble 
Islands off the New England coast. She took his East Crib Rock 
Island in 1993 as collateral for some $3 million that he owed her. 
Of course, legal strife doesn't prevent Joel Schiavone from 
maintaining amicable interactions with the parties with whom he is 
sparring' in court. According to the owner of the Anchor Bar and 
Restaurant, Marshall Moore, Schiavone's habit of lunching at his 
establishment has not been broken since the two became involved 
in a legal dispute. 

Moore's Anchor Bar and Restaurant has been a New Haven 
flXture for 40 years. Schiavone is currently suing him for alleged 
overdue property taxes. Before Moore paid, he wanted explanations 
for certain increases in his property tax. Moore's lease includes a 
provision that he pay a certain percentage of the property taxes 
assessed to the building. Schiavone has been unwilling, or unable,

to account for the amounts in question. "I 
invited the suit," Moore says. "I'd be 
willing to pay if he'd be willing to show me 
the documents." Schiavone has also served 
eviction notices to Moore, which Moore 
has avoided obeying, legally. "I feel no 
animosity towards any of them," Moore 
says. To date, the tax suit is still pending. 
Moore's lease on the Anchor, though, 
will be up fairly shortly. If Schiavone 
succeeds in his current negotiations to 
repurchase the College-Chapel area 
buildings, he may step back in as Moore's 
landlord. But Moore is not worried that 
Schiavone might evict him. Moore banks 
on his reputation as a New Haven staple. 
He loves reciting Jodie Foster's memories 
about the city where she went to college. "I 
remember New Haven," she said in a 
recent television interview. "I remember 
Yale, and all the people there, and of 
course, I'll never forget the Anchor 
Restaurant.'" 

Vasilios Kalogeridis, owner of the 
Copper Kirchen, has property tax 
complaints similar to Moore's. The 
two men watched the residential 
apartments above their restaurants undergo 
renovation. Years later, they found 
themselves paying a share of the increased 
property taxes, reassessed to account for 
these improvements. Both feel that they 


should riot finance renovations that don't 
benefit their own businesses. While Moore 
paid the first two increased bills, 
Kalogeridis refused to pay from the 
beginning. "It's a matter of pride:," he says. 
Kalogeridis has been in and out of 
court with Schiavone since 1988 when he 
first got the increased property tax bill. 
Eventually, due to the FDIC's involvement, 
he was able to take Schiavone to the federal 
courts. "He would have thrown me out," 
Kalogeridis says. "But I said no. I've been 
here for 30 years." Eventually, a court 
decision granted Schiavone $19,000 of the 
over $40,000 he was demanding in tax 
money. Kalogeridis won a new lease, as 
well, but it took him two and a half years 
in court. 

Kalogeridis estimates that he has spent 
at least $20,000 in lawyers fees over the 
past few years alone. "I'd rather pay for the 
lawyers," the Copper Kitchen owner says. 
"I won't let anybody push me around. I 
work seven days a week. I do it the honest 
way. Ask him if he can say that." 

Other tenants jump to defend 
SRDC. "It's the only clean part of 
town," Phylis Satin, owner of the 
Wave Gallery, says. "They're always fixing, 
cleaning, doing. Joel Schiavone's vision has 
kept up the College-Chapel area." 

Lisa Ferretti, owner of Urban Objects, 
has been in her current location for seven 
years. "They're unbelievable landlords," she 
says of the Schiavones. "Problems are taken 
care of within an hour, or that day at least. 
If the FDIC were to sell these buildings off 
individually, the area wouldn't have the 
consistency of his vision-especially in 
terms of things like the plants and the 
lighting at holidays." Ferretti doesn't feel 
that her rent is too high, but she wouldn't 
disclose what she pays. "I negotiated my 
own terms," she says. "I don't know what 
my neighbors are paying." 

Ferretti's immediate neighbor is Frances 
Baker of Sugar Magnolia, one of several 
tenants who pressed charges of favoritism 
against Schiavone in 1994. In November of 
that year, several commercial and 
residential tenants subject to SRDC's 
receivership came forward to complain 
about SRDC's conduct. Charges included 
favoritism, bad-faith lease negotiations, and 
racial discrimination. The plaintiffs 
included Baker, Moore, Kalogeridis, and 
Gene and Jill Cam, owners of Sakia, the 
Native American crafts boutique. The 
court ruled that the claims were worrisome 
but unsubstantiated. It added that SRDC's 
actions were justified as part of its duty as 
rent receiver to "maximize rental income." 

However much these landlord-
tenant 
disputes 
preoccupy 
individual 
merchants, 
for 
Schiavone they pale in comparison to the 
drawn-out foreclosure case. "The 
foreclosures are a double-edged sword," 
says Matthew Nemerson, president of the 
Greater New Haven Chamber of 
Commerce. "By lowering the basis of the 
investment values, you can lower rents and 
make downtown more economically viable. 
But it's cruel and unjust punishment for 
those who tried to create their vision." 
Viability, though, necessitates that the 
corridor continues to be treated as an 
integrated whole--what one tenant sees as 
a little monopoly and what Nemerson calls 
â€¢central planning." As long as the district 
stays intact, Nemerson says the foreclosures 
need have no effect on New Haven. "It's 
simply an unfortunate situation for Joel, or 
for the taxpayer, depending on what 
happens," he says. 

The heart of the complications lies in 
First Constitution's position as both 
entrepreneur and creditor. The bank 
started out by acting like a partner, but it 
cracked down as a creditor when it started 
having trouble. The first sign of light at the 
end of the legal tunnel came in August of 
1994 when all parties signed a binding 
mediation agreement. 

For all its legal jargon, it essentially 
represents an agreement not to have a 
winner. A judge-appointed third party will 
mediate a decision that seems fair to 
everyone involved. After the final hearing, 
Schiavone will have the first option to buy 
the buildings, but he will be able to do so 
only at the mediator's assessment of a fair 
price. Even if this case manages to reach its 
conclusion in the next six months, it will 
still have been in the courts for three years. 
And given the system, this case is sure 
not to be SRDC's last suit. The sheer 
volume of litigation surrounding the 
Chapel Street corridor seems to be the 
price of maintaining the grand vision that 
launched the project.
