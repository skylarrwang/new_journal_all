If you were a young 
experimenter, one of the 
best things that could 
happen to you was to get 
a result that no one 
believes. 

but no matter where they were moved 
they did not develop into a leg and a leg. 
This challenged the belief that the animal 
is organized in the head to tail direction. 
Wieschaus faced trouble publishing these 
results for a great deal of time because of 
the scientific community's skepticism. 

Wieschaus did the main work for 
which he received the Nobel Prize at the 
European Molecular Biology Laboratory 
in Heidelberg, West Germany in the mid- , 
1970s. He worked there with Nusslein-
Volhard where they fed poisons to flies, set 
up inbred families for an appropriate 
number of generations, and then studied 
the resulting embryos. Their goal was to 
determine which of the fruit fly's 20,000 
genes are necessary for appropriate 
development. 

According to the Nobel Foundation 
wrote in their press release, "[Working on 
this project] was a brave decision by two 
young scientists at the beginning of their 
scientific careers. Nobody before had done 
anything similar, and the chances of 
success were very uncertain. For one, the 
number of genes involved might be very 
great." Wieschaus marvels at the idea that 
the microscope with two sets of eye-pieces 
at which he and Nusslein-Volhard sat 
opposite each other for over a year in 
Heidelberg has recently been removed to 
be preserved for history. 

In Heidelberg, the two identified novel 
characteristics in the flies that had died. 
Different segments of the fly were deleted. 
The two found and localized 139 genes 
essential for development. These mutant 
stocks also became extremely useful for 
the scientific community in general. It was 
found in subsequent years that .the basic 
genes involved in development had 
already been organized before vertebrates

and invertebrates diverged in evolution. 
Therefore, biologists working with frogs, 
mice, and humans could use these gene 
localizations to study development in 
higher organisms. 

Wieschaus and Niisslein-Volhard's 
work is also highly regarded for the novel 
approach it took; they were the first to 
systematically identify developmental 
genes. Since then, the genes have been 
used 
to 
understand 
congenital 
malformations in humans, such as the 
complete loss of the iris in the eye or a 
condition known as Waardenbury 
syndrome, in which an individual is deaf, 
has defects in the facial bones and altered 
pigmentation of the iris. 

Ingrid remembers visiting the lab in 
Heidelberg with her mom when she was a 
little girl. Wieschaus and N iisslein-
Volhard were trying to decide on a name 
for a new mutant. Unlike other animal 
models such as yeast, which are named for 
their lineage or function, biologists 
studying flies sometimes give the mutants 
trivial descriptive names. For instance, one 
mutant was named gooseberry, another 
hedgehog, because that's what they looked 
like to Wieschaus and N iisslein-Vol hard 
under a microscope. Ingrid, tired of 
waiting for the adults to choose a name, 
began to repeat her bedtime story about a 
dwarf. Dwarf in German is kruppel. 
"That's it," said Niisslein-Volhard, and in 
their highly acclaimed paper in the 
scientific journal Nature, the mutant is 
named Kriippel, an embryo that is 
especially small because of the removal of 
a number of segments. 

What is not always recognized by 
those outside of science is that some 
silliness and a lot of creativity is involved 
in the discoveries that explain the 
mechanisms of the universe. Wieschaus 
refutes the idea that science is the opposite 
of the arts, where one creates rather than 
discovers. While growing up, he was good 
at two things: academics, including 
science, and art, His drawings hang 
throughout his house, and on a more 
mundane note, he does all of the cooking 
in his home, usually creating his own 
dishes. Deciphering the different embryos 
involves such creativity. 

CC I had the fortunate experience of 
going through most of my life 
really naive and unsophisticated 
and having things work out," says 
Wieschaus. He wanders over to a light 
microscope and deftly sweeps a few 
embryos into view, to locate an example of 
an interesting mutant. An invitation hangs 
behind him, welcoming members of his 
lab to celebrate the news at his home with 
his wife and family. It does not take much 
to get Wieschaus to explain his work, his 
enthusiasm building, his voice barely able 
to keep up with the speed of his thoughts 
as he progresses to the most recent 
questions his lab is studying. He pauses 
thoughtfully, and then says through his 
sheepish grin, "I liked the experiment I 
did last week as much as the ones I did 20 
years ago."
