EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
During the summer Yale is almost unrecognizable to those who only frequent it from August to May. The pace is a little slower, and the weather is a lot nicer. The campus almost attains a sense of calm. But during the early hours of one morning this past summer, the usual calm was broken by the blare of ambulance sirens. Paramedics wheeled a stretcher from a Yale dorm to the ambulance and then sped to Yale-New Haven Hospital. Shortly after his arrival at the hospital, Matt, a Yale student, was pronounced dead.


Matt had stayed in New Haven over the summer to work for Yale; included in the deal was free on-campus housing. When he died that night in his room, those who knew and worked with him were stunned. David, another Yale student, was working out of the same office. Arriving at work the day after Matt died, he remembers, "We showed up at the office and everything was sort of going at its usual frantic pace, but people were clearly shocked about something. People told me, 'A student died last night in his sleep.' Everybody just asked, 'What the fuck?'" David and the rest of the office staff were told that Matt had died from sleep apnea, a rare condition that arrests breathing during sleep. A few weeks later, David was shocked to hear that heroin was involved.


The official cause of death recorded on Matt's death certificate is morphine intoxication. The medical examiner who conducted the autopsy and signed Matt's death certificate was unavailable for comment, but Dr. Edward McDonough, deputy chief medical examiner, explains that morphine intoxication indicates that enough morphine was present in the body to cause death. McDonough explains that morphine intoxication generally occurs in two instances. In the first case, morphine is injected or taken orally-usually in a hospital setting. In the second scenario, heroin in the body breaks down into morphine. He notes that in performing autopsies, "We don't measure for heroin because it is broken down into morphine so quickly."


Sleep apnea does not appear on Matt's death certificate, but McDonough notes that, in general, sleep apnea is difficult to detect after death. "There is nothing at the autopsy that would diagnose sleep apnea because there is no anatomical abnormality. It is up to the individual physician to judge."


Jeff, a student now trying to kick his heroin addiction, claims he was doing heroin with Matt the day he died. "We were hanging out. We were both high. Five or six people that I know of were doing the same exact heroin that day. He left at four that afternoon and the next morning I was woken up by a call from his girlfriend. 'Matt's dead.'" For Jeff, the death was especially frightening. "It really struck me in a bad way, the fact that I had hung out with him the day before. This is the same exact stuff that I was shooting and everybody else was shooting. Same brand."


Even months after he died, the circumstances of Matt's death are by no means clear. Those who used heroin with Matt believe that he did not die of an overdose. They think that the heroin complicated his sleep apnea. In the end, these distinctions are quibbles. Matt's death will remain a nightmare for students at Yale who are still using heroin.


David, a friend of both Matt and Jeff, does not use heroin; he was upset and angry when he learned the cause of death. "When I heard that he had been shooting heroin, I was really pissed because, to me, it was such the logical conclusion to this whole series of things that had been going on."


David has witnessed a loose-knit scene growing among undergraduates. "It started to be this whole, not clique of people, but these sort of multiple cliques. In all my life up until last year, I was offered heroin once. Since last fall, I've been offered heroin two dozen times. It's ridiculous."


Last fall, Jeff and his friends began making regular trips to New York City. "I used to go to the city once every two weeks. We had it down pat, the perfect little plan," Jeff says. "We would leave at a certain time. Get to New York. Park at a specific parking lot that was close to the spot. Hop out of the car. Go to the spot. Buy the drugs. Then, walk around the city for a little bit. Go to a cafe or something. Go do it in the bathroom with straws. Sit down, have some tea, chat, feel fabulous. Walk around a little more, maybe go shopping."


Almost immediately, David began to notice addictive behavior among his friends. "The negative effects of it really became very apparent, very quickly," David says. "Right away, people started talking in addictive ways, saying classic addictive things like, 'Oh, you know, I'm not really doing it that much, but, you know, let's get some,' or 'Oh, I did it three times this week, and I don't want to do it anymore, so I don't think I will.' Then you find out a couple of days later, they've done it again. Totally ridiculous shit. Totally ridiculous."


The summer before Jeff began using heroin, he had been warned by a friend never to try it. Jeff was riding in a car with two friends who were snorting cocaine. One of his friends was high on heroin and nearly passed out. Jeff asked him what heroin was like, and he answered, "I don't want to talk about it; I'm trying to quit." Jeff then mentioned that he wanted to try it sometime. His friend sharply warned him, "Don't ever try it. It's just not worth it. It's like there's this little devil perched in the back of your head, and he will not go away, not for the rest of your life. Once you do it, once you become addicted to it, for the rest of your life, he will be there with you. No other drug is like that." Now that Jeff is trying to quit heroin himself, he echoes the warning his friend gave him. "It makes me nervous how many people are trying it here."


In the midst of the rise in heroin use last spring, David Lipsky, a writer for Rolling Stone, visited Yale, one of the last schools at which he stopped while researching his article, "The Hard Core Curriculum." The feature addressed rising drug use in colleges across the country, and one of the main schools featured in the article was Yale. "I spent five months going to different schools," Lipsky explains in an interview with The New Journal. "I didn't find students at Yale out of key. The same stuff kept coming up," he notes. According to Lipsky, Yale stood out from other schools in that the center of the Yale heroin subculture was said to be D Parry, a group that supposedly throws regular heroin parties that attract 40 to 60 users each time. Many doubt that this group exists. David explains that, though there is substantial heroin use at Yale, "It was certainly never as many as was stated in the Rolling Stone article, and there were certainly never parties organized around doing it."


One of the students interviewed for the article remembers that several of those contacted by Rolling Stone had personal problems with Lipsky. "My friend basically decided-and he said this before the interview-that he was going to fuck with this guy, simply because he didn't like the way that the guy had gotten in touch with him. He thought it was sleazy how he had been contacted. He wanted to see if the guy was willing to bite the bait and suck up this propaganda."


During the interview, the friend casually mentioned D Party, and no one else interviewed contradicted him. When the article was published, this student's account of D Party served as the article's introduction. Despite the personal problems that some students had with Lipsky, almost everyone interviewed was excited to be in the article in Rolling Stone. "Hell, it was fun to be in the Rolling Stone thing, and part of the reason it was fun was because it was part of living out this hip role, whatever that is," said the student who was interviewed.


After Rolling Stone published the article in October, it was quickly dismissed in a front page Yale Daily News piece entitled, "Students Dupe Rolling Stone Reporter." The Daily News reported, "Undergraduates fabricated the stories behind [the] Rolling Stone magazine expose depicting an active heroin subculture at Yale." D Party was a hoax.


While a heroin subculture at Yale may not revolve around large parties, it is active inasmuch as small groups of people get together to use heroin. David estimates that the total number of heroin users at Yale could be as many as 30 or 40, but he adds that they never get together in large groups. Commenting on the increased use last fall, David says, "It was a very secretive thing. It was done in small, small groups." Currently, David still knows of a number of users. "I could easily think right off the top of my head of 15 or 20 people."


Zoey, a Yale student recovering from her addiction, explains, "Heroin users at Yale tend to be very isolated and just experiment or dabble. There isn't a network." While Yale is far from a campus of dope fiends, heroin has found a place in some social circles.
