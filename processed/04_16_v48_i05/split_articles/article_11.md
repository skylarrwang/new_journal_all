One of the region’s only Hindu temples 
finds its footing in New Haven
Rohan Naik 
New Haven’s only Hindu temple, Shree Nathji 
Haveli, was once a banquet hall. Since opening in Octo­
ber 2010, the space has been converted into something 
of a haven for regional Hindus, who previously had to 
travel to New Jersey or New York to attend services. 
This is not uncommon for Hindu Americans; although 
I’m not particularly religious, my family often drove 
an hour to our temple during my childhood in Hous­
ton. We had no local center for cultural life like Shree 
Nathji Haveli, which offers six prayer services a day to 
an expanding three-hundred-person congregation, one 
of the four hundred temples in the United States that 
serve the seven tenth of one percent of the population 
that is Hindu, according to the Pew Research Center.

Prakash Bhai, meaning “brother Prakash” in Hindi, 
is a temple trustee. He has a soft-spoken enthusiasm, 
greying hair, and a mustache. When I visited the tem­
ple, he welcomed me into the interior, where statues 
and prayer spaces still clash with the rusty tables and 
chairs piled against the walls, remnants of the ban­
quet hall. The old main stage has been refurbished 
as a brightly adorned pulpit, where a statue of Shree 
Nathji—the younger manifestation of the Hindu deity 
Krishna—stands enveloped by white marble.

At a weekly Sunday Paathshala, Hindu education for 
children in the community, a wiry 7-year-old named 
Vikram stood on stage with his PowerPoint: “The Logic 
Behind Hinduism.” He presented in front of forty fid­
gety young peers, reciting information with little hesi­
tation. 

As Vikram spoke, Prakash Bhai praised the greater 
New Haven community’s response to the temple. He 
could only recall a single moment of strife in local 
relations. At an early zoning meeting, one community 
member called the temple a mosque, conflating Hin­
duism with Islam, a mistake that indicated ignorance 
at best and general xenophobia at worst. An awkward 
silence ensued, broken only when a temple representa­
tive corrected the misnomer.

“It’s the way it is,” he said, shrugging, when I asked 
him if he found the mistake offensive. It is likely not 
the first time it has happened, but locals are learning. 
Shree Nathji Haveli continues to host annual com­
munity meetings where representatives from the New 
Haven Police Department and the New Haven city 
government meet temple practitioners and explore the 
space. Prakash Bhai considers these meetings moments 
of genuine cultural exchange. 

Yet other community members, like Yash Agarwal, 
a New Haven resident and temple volunteer, do not 
share this optimism. He said, frowning, that Americans 
don’t understand Hinduism: “I can understand that 
they don’t want another religion to take over, but Hin­
duism isn’t about overtaking; it’s about learning about 
the good in all.” 

Part of Paathshala lessons attempt to prime the chil­
dren for challenging situations in Hindu life. Temple 
volunteers ask tough questions about how one should 
respond to a bully, or how, given today’s climate of ris­
ing Islamophobia, to explain the difference between 
Hinduism and Islam and the importance of learning 
about both religions. The question isn’t interested in 
the theological distinctions between the two faiths, but 
rather how one should explain those distinctions to 
someone else. 

“The kids are the ones that love coming,” said 
Prakash Bhai as he observed the scene. “They finish 
their chores just so they can come earlier.” Although 
Prakash Bhai seems to have a rosy picture of Hindu life 
in New Haven, his conviction in the weekly Paathshala 
lesson holds true. The kids are engaged. They race to 
ask questions, interrupting each other.

But Shree Nathji Haveli is not just a children’s 
school. It also offers prayer sessions for adults and 
activities for the elderly, becoming a place for com­
munity socialization at the end of the week. Yet Shree 
Nathji Haveli has failed to attract local adolescent Hin­
dus: only two teenagers showed up to class, too few to 
continue funding the program. This frustrates Prakash 
Bhai. “Something has to be done,” he said, although he 
wasn’t quite sure what. 

This is a problem of the temple’s age. It is only six 
years old, meaning current teenagers have not grown 
up with the Shree Nathji Haveli community. Prakash 
Bhai is confident that the children enrolled in the cur­
rent Paathshala class will continue to attend as teen­
agers.

After Vikram ended his presentation, Prakash Bhai 
took the stage. He leaned into the microphone and 
announced that a temple-wide Easter egg hunt would 
be starting—now. 

Immediately, the old banquet hall erupted in chaotic 
screams and laughter as the children raced around the 
room, running into each other and their parents’ legs. 
Prakash Bhai smiled at my obvious confusion. Easter? 
“We’re part of America now,” he said. “This is our 
culture, too.” 

Even Vikram dropped his professional demeanor. 
He raced around the room, snatched an egg from 
below a table, and placed it at the feet of a statue of 
Shree Nathji.
