THE  NEW  JOURNAL
A year after we lost the house, on a chilly summer 
day, my mother refused to get out of the car. That is the 
only sentence written in my journal. Mom refuses to get 
out of the car. We were in a dirt parking lot one block 
away from our old house. Neither of us had visited 
the house since it had been foreclosed upon one year 
earlier. I was 20. My mother was now living with my 
grandfather in a town forty miles away. I know now that 
I didn’t want to stay with her, but what I told myself 
then, in the car, was that I wanted to visit our next-door 
neighbors. I had it in my mind that I would not be see­
ing much of them in the future. 

The first thing I noticed when I arrived was a man 
carrying a baby at the top of my old house’s driveway. 
He was the new owner. My neighbor Valerie waved to 
me from her porch. She had painted every piece of 
patio furniture canary yellow. She sat on a chair with a 
sheaf of drawing paper in her lap. There was a line of 
clothes that billowed in the wind. This wasn’t the first 
time that I wanted to be a part of her family. This time, 
though, I felt something dangerous well up inside me. 
It wasn’t jealousy. In that moment I didn’t want what 
Valerie had; I wanted for her not to have it. It fright­
ened me. The feeling came and went like an image of 
a pop can flashed onto a movie screen, too quickly for 
me to know where it came from or whether it was real. I 
knew only that the woman who sat painting on an ugly 
chair was a woman with whom I did not want to spend 
the next seven days. My breath rose and fell as I walked 
up to her. We smiled at one another in a way that was 
friendly, but not as friendly as I would have expected, 
coming back to the town after a long time.

One night the new owners threw a party. I watched it 
from the window of my room in Valerie’s house. Men 
in Hawaiian shirts looked at a spiral of smoke curl­
ing up in the air from a grill. Women stood in dresses 
swaying in the wind and children ran barefoot on the 
grass and the mulch around the catalpa trees. Someone 
played an old rock album from a boom box on a picnic 
table that my mother and I had left in the yard. When 
the sun set, a woman came out of the back door with a 
white cake with candles for the man I recognized as the 
father. A thrum of drunken voices sang “Happy Birth­
day.” I told myself I would remember what I saw. One 
day I would write about it. 

I was staying alone in the room of Valerie’s daugh­
ter. Valerie was an artist and years ago had painted a 
mural of the neighborhood children on the walls of 
her daughter’s bedroom. The one who was supposed 
to be me stood turned away from the other children 
with a dandelion in her hand. She held the flower to 
her face and watched the seeds flow away in the wind. 
The other girls played with one another and with boys 
in a garden that looked like Eden. As a child, I hated 
that painting. 

I was staring at the wall wondering why I had come. I 
wasn’t thinking about the past. I was thinking about the 
party. I imagined small acts of terror I could do to that 
house—breaking a window, spray-painting the walls, 
slashing tires. But no—I didn’t want to do anything vio­
lent. I only wanted to look through the window and see 
what of ours the family had kept, if anything. 

I shut the back door softly behind me and walked 
across the gravel to a patch of grass under the 
dining room window. Heat rose sharply in my 
cheeks. I felt the same way I did as a child before 
I stole something. The inside of the house was 
dark. I waited to feel something piercing in my 
chest—some prickly violent unfamiliar pain, 
some feeling that I otherwise did not allow 
myself to feel, anger or hatred or resentment, 
that for once I could feel without fear of judg­
ment. 

Somewhere in the darkness a baby cried. A 
window must have been open because the cry 
wasn’t muffled. Upstairs a light went on and a 
pair of shadows weaved around one another on 
the curtain. The noise startled me. There was 
nothing unique about it, but for some reason it 
reminded me of a voice I knew. The air smelled 
of the lilacs that my father had planted for my 
mother at the foot of the porch years ago. 

It’s hard for me to say whether we would have 
stayed in the house if my father were alive. I’m 
not sure if it’s useful to play that game, to rewind 
the tape and play it as if he were alive. My 
mother would not have quit her job to take care 
of me. She would not have lost what little sav­
ings she had. People we knew would die. Others 
would get married. A plane would still hit the 
towers. Not long after that, a war would start. 
The housing market would crash. But somehow 
it wouldn’t matter. Everything would fall into 
place. We would be fine. 

I started back the way I’d come, careful not to 
cut my bare feet on the gravel, as I often did as 
a child. 

It got light early in the summer, early enough 
for me to explore the neighborhood without fear 
of running into anyone. Before breakfast, I’d 
made it a rule to run around town. I had never 
seen our house in the soft pale blue light of 
morning. I’d had no reason to. I learned from 
Valerie that the father had a job at a hospital. He 
left before sunrise. One day when I was sure no 
one was home I went through the yard to jump 
into the pool. But the new owners had covered it 
with a tarp, an old broken tarp with a hole in the 
middle. I was walking to the edge when I saw on 
the concrete a small pool of blood around a dead 
robin. I used a catalpa leaf to carry the bird into 
the forest behind the field in my old yard. When 
I was a child, my mother and I played games 
in the forest, stumbling out the other side pre­
tending to be explorers or time travelers who’d

happened on a new place. My elementary school was 
on the other side of the forest and I pretended Mom 
was my sister and the other kids and parents were our 
long lost family. I was thinking about the game as I dug 
a hole in the damp soil. My mother was happy then. 

During the time when my mother and I were moving 
out of our house, I bought a journal in which I wrote 
down everything I wanted to remember. I didn’t write 
about my mother or myself or anyone else. Most of my 
entries were inventories of the objects that filled every 
room in our house. They reminded me of the long 
rambling genealogies of the Bible. Living room: red vel­
vet couch, paisley chair, green Victorian loveseat with 
mahogany cherubs, wooden jewelry box I painted red 
and blue, framed wolf painting (Dad’s?). I was happy to 
think that I was producing something that only I would 
want to read. Something that my mother would care 
very little about. The fact that I had finally found a 
way to remember without inserting my perilous, naked, 
vulnerable self into the matter was a relief. Even if my 
mother found my journal, I was safe. 

But after we moved I kept using it, mostly to record 
the fights I had with my mother. They were not diary 
entries, not really. They were transcriptions. My hand­
writing was messy. I wrote most of the entries as fast as I 
could in the minutes after I had stormed into my room. 
But the words that I wrote had the same icy coolness of 
my lists. I wrote our arguments like lines of dialogue. 

I didn’t take out my journal until the last day, when 
the new owners had a yard sale. I recognized many of 
the objects as things we had left behind. The red vel­
vet couch was on the curb with the other objects they 
were giving away. The woman told me to take anything 
I’d like. I found in the garage a mirror that had been 
there ever since I was a child. My grandmother on my 
father’s side had brought it from a vacation in France 
not long before she died. It was too big for any room in 
the house. I had forgotten it. 

I THOUGHT SUDDENLY 
OF MY FATHER, WHOM 
I REMEMBERED DIMLY 
BUT DIDN’T KNOW. MY 
MEMORIES OF HIM COME 
AND GO LIKE LONG BRIGHT 
SQUARES OF LIGHT THAT 
PASS OVER A DARK WALL. 
WHAT I FELT, I THINK, 
WAS LOVE. 

I thought suddenly of my father, whom I remem­
bered dimly but didn’t know. My memories of him 
come and go like long bright squares of light that 
pass over a dark wall. What I felt, I think, was love. 
I had no words to prime the feeling. I hadn’t kept a 
journal before he died, but whatever the feeling was, 
it remained. It came to me that my only memories of 
him were in the house, and I wondered if that meant 
anything—if one day I would wake up in a different 
place and find that I had forgotten to remember him 
because nothing and no one around me was reminding 
me to do so. That the tape I ran in my head from time 
to time of him throwing me in the air before bed or 
holding a pink afghan tightly around his shoulders on 
a hot afternoon, hours before an ambulance drove to 
the top of our driveway—that one day this tape would 
run out, and I would lose whatever it was that made me 
keep rewinding it. I wanted to keep missing him and I 
feared the day this would stop being so. 

There was a crack in the middle of the mirror. I was 
staring at my figure, in shadow with the sun behind 
me. I reached to feel the cold glass. I wondered what 
about this day I would forget later on. As I heard my 
mother’s car pull into Valerie’s driveway, I touched my 
collarbone, and even in the darkness, I wished sud­
denly there were more of me.
