YOU ARE WHAT YOU WEAR
In an exhibit on Jewish identity, T-shirts become the canvas
Lora Kelley 
“Yiddish Players Club,” reads a white bro tank on 
a pink plastic hanger. Its label card defines a Yiddish 
Player as a “Dreamer. Hustler. Artist. Thinker. Leader. 
The ambassador of Yiddish Swag.” “Shalom, Y’all,” 
another shirt greets. “I <3 Jews,” reads another. It keeps 
going—college Hillel T-shirts, shirts with delicate 
Hebrew script, a racy tee with “Jews Do It for Eight 
Nights” printed over a menorah. These shirts make up 
the well-traveled art exhibition featured at the Ameri­
can Jewish Historical Society in New York this winter: 
“Shmattes.”

“Shmattes,” the Yiddish word for “rags” or “gar­
ments,” is the brainchild of Anne Grant DIV ’17. The 
nonprofit art show explores the semiotic value of Jew­
ish-themed T-shirts, focusing specifically on millen­
nial “culturally Jewish” identity. According to Grant, 
“T-shirts have a lot of data to give us about how Jews—
and non-Jews—are negotiating with contemporary Jew­
ish identity,” and also about how comfortable they feel 
broadcasting their heritage.

After moving to New Haven to work as an arts coor­
dinator at the Jewish Community Center, Grant linked 
up with the Joseph Slifka Center for Jewish Life at Yale 
to exhibit “Shmattes.” She worked closely with Slifka’s 
then-curator, Lucy Partman ’14, a current doctoral stu­
dent in art history at Princeton and an employee of the 
Jewish Museum in New York. With a couple of others 
at Slifka, Partman and Grant curated “T-shirt Talk: The 
Art of Reimagining Cultural Jewish Identity,” which fea­
tured close to seventy shirts and hung on Slifka’s walls 
in spring 2014. Then, once the shirts had congealed 
into a show, Grant named her project “Shmattes.” The 
collection has since traveled to Brown, the University 
of Virginia, and the American Jewish Historical Society 
in New York City.

Grant began collecting Jewish T-shirts a few years 
ago, branching off from her personal five-shirt collec­
tion (“One HellUVA Jew” reads one shirt she acquired 
while pursuing her bachelor’s degree in Jewish Stud­
ies at the University of Virginia). While at UVA, where 
she was involved with the Hillel (the campus center for 
Jewish life), she recalls, “I had a shirt that said ‘sleep 
with me’ from a fundraiser where you slept outside for 
charity. And I thought, ‘Wow, a Hillel is literally spon­
soring a T-shirt with a very explicit sexual reference, 
and not even a disguised reference.’” After getting a 
shirt with a drug reference from a very old Philadelphia 
delicatessen, she started to recognize a pattern and 
began gathering more shirts, on eBay and from friends. 
Today, her collection numbers 175 shirts. She displays 
sixty to eighty in each show.
