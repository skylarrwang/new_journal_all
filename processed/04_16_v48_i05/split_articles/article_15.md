Political Union. After much internal agitation, the 
Union withdrew its invitation. But several other orga­
nizations attempted to invite Shockley, inducing Brew­
ster to denounce such invitations as inconsiderate and 
irresponsible, criticizing “the use of free speech as a 
game.” Shockley did end up coming to campus, invited 
by Yale’s branch of the Young Americans for Freedom, 
but protesters, who made up almost a third of the audi­
ence, shouted insults and obscenities at Shockley. After 
an hour and fifteen minutes, University Secretary Sam 
Chauncey closed the meeting. For the first time in 
the University’s modern history, a guest was unable to 
speak because of organized disruption. 

While the editorial board of the Yale Daily News spoke 
out in support of the protesters, Brewster’s response was 
far more critical. “It makes me sick that even a small 
minority of Yale students would choose storm trooper 
tactics in preference to freedom of speech,” he said. 
To ensure such an event would never happen again, 
Brewster, then president of the University, created a 
committee to establish a formal policy by which Yale 
could deal with issues of freedom of speech. In Decem­
ber of 1974, the committee released the “Report of the 
Committee on Freedom of Expression at Yale,” known 
as the Woodward Report after the committee’s head, 
historian C. Vann Woodward. According to the report, 
“the paramount obligation of the University is to pro­
tect their right to free expression,” even when such free 
expression comes at the expense of “civility and mutual 
respect.” The Woodward Report is still hailed as a shin­
ing example of the University’s exercise of its values; 
President Peter Salovey quoted it heavily during his 
2014 address to the freshman class.

But while the Woodward Report was explicit in its 
commitment to free discourse, it dealt primarily with 
student protest over speakers invited to Yale. Today’s 
conversations around free speech, however, focus on 
individual interactions among students. During the 
Intelligence Squared debate, Kaminer cited cases 
where students at Amherst College and the University 
of South Carolina were investigated for distributing 
posters which other students found offensive. That 
these students were investigated, she said, is demon­
strative of a recent shift in campus climate that threat­
ens free speech. Yet the kind of cases Kaminer outlined 
are not new either. And at Yale, the administration’s 
stance is far more nebulous than the clear-cut commit­
ments of the Woodward Report might suggest.

At Yale’s 1986 Gay and Lesbian Awareness Day, 
Wayne Dick, a Yale student, distributed flyers advo­
cating “Bestiality Awareness Day.” Yale’s Executive 
Committee sentenced Dick to two years of probation, 
calling the fliers harassment of the queer community. 
But when Dick appealed his sentence on the grounds 
that the administration had threatened his freedom of 
expression, Yale retracted its probation and eventually 
expunged the incident from Dick’s record.

Twenty-two years later, the University inflicted no 
punishment on the members of Yale’s Zeta Psi frater­
nity when its pledges held signs outside the Women’s 
Center that read, “We Love Yale Sluts.” But in 2010, 
when fraternity Delta Kappa Epsilon sung a song that 
“made light of rape,” the University sanctioned the frat 
on the grounds that the brothers had “threatened and 
intimidated others.” Even then, Yale was not exempt 
from the criticism that it unduly restricted speech: 
FIRE urged then-President Richard Levin to overturn 
the punishment.

Now, as free speech advocates line up against Yale stu­
dents protesting aspects of campus culture—including 
the alleged frat party that was for “white girls only”—
the possibility of establishing bright lines recedes even 
further. Should blatantly discriminatory speech be 
allowed in the interest of protecting all speech?

At the Intelligence Squared debate, affirmative 
speaker McWhorter said no: “If there is a culture that 
would allow someone to say that only white women 
are allowed at a fraternity party, well, that should be 
shouted to the heavens most certainly.”

Where, then, does McWhorter draw the line? I asked 
him to clarify over email, after the debate: “That frat

party episode should be protested. The frat brother 
deserves to be called a racist. However, discussion and 
debate over obviously less egregious things is fine, but 
should not entail charges that people are ‘racist’ from 
the get go, or even a general rolling implication that 
‘racism’ must be at the bottom of the matter. That is, 
these discussions should not essentially be show trials.” 
McWhorter presented a nuance mostly absent from 
the debate itself. While it’s easy to decry a culture that 
insists not only on protesting controversial speakers, 
but also on silencing them completely, it’s much more 
difficult to extend that logic to interactions between 
students, or between students and professors, and 
claim that speaking out against racism—as students did 
after the SAE “white girls only” incident—represents a 
threat to free speech. 

In the end, the vote was sixty-six percent in the affir­
mative (“Free speech is threatened on campus”), and 
twenty-five percent in the negative, with nine percent 
undecided. The affirmative picked up seventeen per­
cent of the vote, and was pronounced the winner.

But as the audience filed out of the Rep, it was dif­
ficult to be satisfied with the discourse. In the inter­
est of expanding the scope to “campus” writ large, the 
details of specific issues at different universities across 
the country were elided into blunt talking points, and 
whatever emotions or nuance they might have con­
tained disappeared entirely. But this was perhaps to 
be expected: By design, debate is not action, and no 
one expected this one to settle the centuries-old “free 
speech” question in an hour and a half. Yet the event 
purported to offer, if not answers, at least clarity. But 
on the issues raised in the Silliman courtyard, on Cross 
Campus, at the March of Resilience, and in private 
spaces all over the University last semester, it didn’t.

The first thing Hondo Colwick remembers about 
his surgery is the line of metal utensils on a sterile blue 
sheet. From birth, he had a fatty flap of¬ skin where 
there should have been a foot. After he turned 3, sur­
geons sliced off two toes that protruded from the flap’s 
side. The toes had kept Hondo from easily placing his 
leg into the below-the-knee prosthesis he’d worn since 
he was ten months old. They also marked what could 
have been, if his mother had not used a defective con­
traceptive called the Dalkon Shield. It stole from the 
baby it was meant to prevent. 

Thirty-seven years after the surgery, Hondo runs his 
hands over the plaster mold of another man’s stump. 
He is an artificial limb maker at the New England 
Orthotic and Prosthetic Systems (NEOPS) fabrication 
center in Branford, Connecticut. Today’s project, a 
snow-white thigh, sticks out from the edge of the table 
like a precarious Popsicle. A vise grip holds it parallel 
to the floor, and a metal rod runs from plaster groin to 
plaster knee—right where the bone would be.  

The plaster molds that populate the center are stand-
ins for absentee clients. The UPS truck delivers casts 
from doctors’ offices around New England every morn­
ing. Just as dentists stick putty on teenagers’ teeth, phy­
sicians wrap plaster gauze around patients’ shortened 
limbs. When the hardened forms arrive at the fabrica­
tion center, the prosthetic technicians line them up. 
Hondo’s coworkers fill the casts, and voilà: in fifteen 
minutes, there’s a statuesque copy of the patient’s leg. 
Ripped casts, mottled plastic, and yesterday’s 
lunch fill blue Rubbermaid Brute trash containers at 
NEOPS. Dozens of plaster half-limbs are shoved under 
the table beside the industrial oven. Hondo uses them 
to make cup-shaped sockets to fit around each ampu­
tee’s stump. The sockets attach to metal pylons, which 
connect to a carbon-fiber skeleton inside a plastic foot. 
They lean against the fabrication center’s worktables, 
like strange flowers blooming on hollow stems. Five 
plastic toes and five plastic toenails make the foot at the 
end almost pretty, while the black carbon fiber wedge 
hidden inside makes it functional. This doll-like end 
absorbs the shock, the thump, of foot striking ground. It 
gives the amputee a natural spring in his step. 

Hondo is a ruddy-faced man with a sense of humor 
and a collection of T-shirts in sometimes-poor taste; 
one from Bass Pro Shops reads: “I Like ’Em With Long 
Legs and A Big Rack!” alongside a deer silhouette. 
But when he is at work, nothing can disturb him; he 
answers questions with a few cheery but terse replies, 
sometimes little more than, “Yup.” Like the surgeons 
looking for his small toes, he inspects the mold to find 
the hills that stick out and the valleys that go too deep. 
He looks for the smooth dip right under the patella, the 
small protrusion of the tibia, and the stretch of muscle 
that bears pressure on the back of the calf. He under­
stands, from lumbering around on his own prosthesis, 
that if the surface does not feel smooth under his palm, 
a dull ache will settle into the patient’s leg by the mid­
dle of the day. 

Hondo is one of only two men on the ten-person 
staff with a prosthesis; the other works at the stitching 
station. The men blare the radio while working, and 
Hondo launches into a high-pitched rendition of the 
song. “Take a look at my girlfriend, yeah, yeah,” he 
sings. 

“We’re looking at a big, big lady!” a co-worker later 
yells as he pulls out an oversized plaster mold. “Where’s 
my girl?”

“Was she nice?” Hondo asks cheerily.

“Oh, she’s adorable,” the man replies, returning to 
work.  

This banter is part of an environment where men 
break off chunks of an old man’s artificial hamstring 
while singing along to Top-Forty hits. Though Hondo’s 
entirely respectful of the clients, these jokes have the 
casualness of a bunch of guys in a workplace (the only 
woman works in the office, away from the floor). On 
a Monday morning, Michael Jackson’s “Beat It” plays 
like an ironic anthem: “Don’t wanna see no blood, 
don’t be a macho man / You wanna be tough, better do 
what you can.” 

No other man in the world has a prosthetic like 
Hondo Colwick’s. For one thing, his socket extends 
all the way from knee to ankle to accommodate his
