David Mendieta leans over the railing at John F. 
Kennedy International Airport, holding his baby boy 
and glancing often at the arrivals board with heavy eye­
lids. A 25-year-old contractor, Mendieta woke up his 
wife and son before dawn for the two-hour drive from 
their house in West Haven to pick up his mother at 
the terminal. His son bats a “Welcome Home” balloon. 
Tired families trickle into the lobby, all waiting for 
their mothers to arrive from Mexico. Anxiety mounts 
as light spills through the large windows, reflecting off 
of sterile marble tiles. They should have been here by 
now. Are they lost? Stuck in customs?
Finally, his mother, Doña Rosa Romero, speed-walks 
through the hallway, her eyes scanning the crowd. 
When she sees David, she drops her aged suitcase to 
run and hug him tight. Today, Sunday, Jan. 31, 2016, 
they embrace for the first time in a decade. When they 
break apart, Mendieta introduces Romero to her grand­
son and her daughter-in-law. The four of them huddle 
together as a family for the first time. All around them, 
the throng of reunited families grows, smiling through 
happy tears. They pose for photos, soon to hit Face­
book, accumulating Likes from relatives back home 
in San Francisco, Tetlanohcan, Tlaxcala, and its sister 
city, New Haven, Connecticut.
David left their town at 15, compelled by economic 
necessity. He followed the perilous migrant trail north 
to New Haven, a path well trodden by many other men 
and women from Tlaxcala; an estimated fifteen percent 
of Tetlanohcan lives in New Haven. Most are undocu­
mented migrants and cannot visit home in Mexico for 
fear of not being able to make it back across the tighten­
ing and increasingly dangerous border. Their mothers 
back in Mexico, as self-sustaining farmers (campesinas) 
with little to no income, cannot obtain visas to visit 
their relatives. 
Yet Romero and twenty-two other women devised a 
way come to New Haven despite the distance, cruel pol­
icies, and fear. They are traveling across Connecticut 
and New York to perform their play, La Casa Rosa (The 
Pink House) at universities and theaters that vouched 
for them during the unpredictable process of secur­
ing a visa. Only as actresses—not as mothers—could 
they access three-month visas that allow them visit 
their children and family members. They conceived 
La Casa Rosa in collaboration with Daniel Carlton, a
