Besides, Buckley is not the typical white-collar, 
“creative type” urbexer, the kind whose love affairs 
with sites of industrial toil can seem condescending at 
best and vaguely necrophiliac at worst. He spends his 
weeks working in a factory as a welder, making boat 
stands. His father is a machinist. His aunts worked 
in New Bedford’s textile mills, several of which have 
now, like much of Winchester, been turned into lofts. 
(In a more thoroughly Vanished New England, his 
great-great-grandfather hunted whale on the last whal­
ing ship out of New Bedford.) 

Almost every weekend, he drives to new sites, often 
with his girlfriend, Tessa. They discover some online, 
reported by other urbexers, but Buckley is proud that 
he’s located about a dozen that, as far as he can tell, 
no one else has documented online. Factories are 
among the easier places to find: using Google Earth, 
he chooses a town, finds a river, zooms in, and follows 
the water until he sees the signs of ruins.

Forest City real estate promotes the Winchester Lofts 
with allusions to what they used to be. The marketing 
strategy dovetails with one of the funding sources for 
the project: nearly twenty million dollars in federal and 
state tax credits, granted to developers for preserving 
historic structures. 

Israel Marquez is a leasing consultant at Winchester, 
and part of his job is to give prospective renters tours of 
the facilities. Marquez looks to be in his late twenties, 
wears a purple sweater and neat black slacks, and ties 
his shoulder-length hair in a ponytail. 

He offers me a cup of coffee made with a Keurig 
in the corner of the leasing office. Then he points out 
the electronic concierge that displays images telling 
residents if they have mail or need to pay their rent. 
He takes me to the game room with a pool table, the 
lounge with a television, and the very clean fitness 
room, all of which are equipped with complimentary 
WiFi. There is a “pet spa” to avoid the indignity of 
bathing your dog in a shower.

The apartment units themselves look how lofts usu­
ally look: artfully sterile, intentionally cool. Exposed 
pipes, preserved from the factory, cross over our heads. 
“The theme of Winchester,” as Marquez calls it, also 
appears in art featured in the common spaces. Framed, 
enlarged copies of the rifle patents greet us as we get 
off the elevator. Mid-century advertisements for Win­
chester guns line the hall from the leasing office to the 
common spaces. And large, color photographs of the 
factory in its rusting, pre-lofts state look, in this context, 
like the large animal heads Teddy Roosevelt must have 
taken home as trophies won with Winchester rifles in 
1908. 

The photographs are strikingly similar to those Buck­
ley uploads to Instagram and his website. The differ­
ence is that what Buckley does is accessible to any­
one with an Internet connection, and it’s against the 
rules—he breaks countless trespassing laws while doing 
it. Jonathan Gertman, development manager of Forest 
City, told me over the phone that he had never heard 
of anyone visiting the fenced-off section of the building 
just for fun. The property, like the rest of America’s 
thirty thousand Forest City apartment complexes, he 
says, has plenty of parking lot lighting and good secu­
rity. The old part of Winchester is simply best left alone.

The developers, however, commissioned photogra­
pher Ramsey Bakhoum to go into the pre-reconstruc­
tion buildings to create works for loft residents to enjoy. 
Bakhoum’s artist statement, next to a black-and-white 
shot titled “Rebirth,” says the “aged factory, rich with 
history, texture, architectural craft and stories untold 
created a unique opportunity to find and reveal beauty 
amidst its forgotten layers and chambers.” The photo­
graphs turn all the spectators—all the loft residents—
into armchair urban explorers. The ruin pictures 
become artifacts that make it easier to ignore the actual 
ruins a few feet away. 

In the case of the Winchester Repeating Arms Fac­
tory, the date of total disappearance (or, to use Forest 
City’s terminology, of rebirth) is uncertain. Gertman 
said the company won’t move forward with plans to 
redevelop the last forty percent of the factory until it’s 
certain there’s enough demand for housing in the city. 
So Buckley’s contribution to the long digital catalogue 
of the abandoned Winchester Repeating Arms Factory 
probably won’t be the last. 

As we climb up the stairs and get closer to the roof, 
the sun gets brighter. Buckley admires the elevator 
shaft and the cables stretching into the darkness. He 
shoots a photograph into the shaft, which later he will 
upload to Facebook with the caption “Going down… 
way, way down.”

On one of the higher floors, there’s a part of the 
building with no roof, like a porch. Standing on it, 
we can look out and see the smooth wall of renovated 
section of the building, just feet away. This afternoon, 
Buckley will drive back to New Bedford and pass who 
knows how many abandoned buildings, all different, all 
decaying or redeveloping, but vanishing all the same. 
Americans may never again see working factories like 
Winchester, and before long may see the last of decay­
ing factories like Winchester. What we will see instead 
are lofts.
