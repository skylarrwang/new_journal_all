LET’S TALK ABOUT SPEECH

A flashy “free speech debate” takes the stage
Eleanor Womack 
The empty stage of the Yale Repertory Theatre 
looked like the set of a talk show. A black-and-white 
photograph of the New York City skyline hung in three 
panels in the center, and two empty frosted-glass tables 
stood on either side of the stage, each flanked by a black 
podium. Lights on the walls shifted sunset-like from 
orange to pink. On March 1, Yale students, professors, 
New Haven locals, and even high school debate teams 
shuffled into the Rep clutching grey pamphlets that 
declared: “Free Speech is Threatened on Campus.”

This was a public debate hosted by the nonprofit 
Intelligence Squared, but its resolution might have 
been lifted from any of the endless finger-wagging 
think pieces that appeared in response to anti-rac­
ism demonstrations last semester at the University of 
Missouri, Yale, and other colleges. And although the 
debate had been scheduled long before last Novem­
ber, higher-ups at Intelligence Squared chose the topic 
specifically because of its relevance to Yale, according 
to Dana Wolf, the executive producer of Intelligence 
Squared U.S.

In the theatre, Silliman Master Nicholas Christakis 
sat alone in the third row. Last November, when his 
wife, associate master and professor of psychology Erika 
Christakis, quoted him in an email criticizing over-sen­
sitivity to cultural appropriation, students confronted 
Master Christakis in the Silliman courtyard. Christakis 
defended himself, and the email his wife sent, by say­
ing, “I apologize for causing pain, but I am not sorry for 
the statement … I stand behind free speech. I defend 
the right for people to speak their minds.” The abstract 
universality Christakis invoked then would return in

the debate, partly by design: moderator John Donvan 
insisted that the arguments presented did not refer spe­
cifically to Yale, but to college campuses all over the 
country.

Murmurs rose from the crowd as the audience 
waited for the debate to begin. A student in a sweater 
vest walked up to Christakis, smiled, and bent down to 
talk. They chatted amicably.

The four debaters took their seats on stage. On the 
affirmative side were Wendy Kaminer, a lawyer and a 
writer for the Foundation for Individual Rights in Edu­
cation (FIRE), and John McWhorter, a professor of 
linguistics at Columbia. Arguing for the negative side 
were Shaun Harper, the executive director of the Uni­
versity of Pennsylvania’s Center for the Study of Race 
& Equity in Education, and Yale philosophy professor 
Jason Stanley. 

But before anyone gave opening remarks, Donvan 
instructed the audience to vote using the remotes on 
the arms of each seat. The outcome of the debate, he 
explained, would be determined not by which side had 
the highest percentage of the vote, but by the differ­
ence between votes collected at the beginning and end 
of the debate. When asked if free speech is threatened 
on campus, forty-nine percent of the audience said yes, 
twenty-seven percent said no, and twenty-four percent 
were undecided.

Round one began with each debater giving a six-min­
ute opening speech. The speeches ran the gamut of 
traditional argument: Kaminer argued that the ten­
dency to label offensive speech as “micro-aggressions” 
or “forms of discrimination” punishes and suppresses 
such speech as if it were capable of physical violence. 
And although McWhorter emphasized that he opposed 
unlimited free speech, citing slavery and genocide as 
topics too abhorrent to be worthy of any debate, he crit­
icized students for shouting down less obviously offen­
sive things instead of engaging in discussion. “What is 
the line between cultural appropriation and cultural 
mixture?” he asked. “That’s a tough one. It’s subtle. It’s 
worth debate. It’s not a matter of just shouting people 
down if a certain subject comes up or if a certain action 
is performed.”

On the right side of the stage, Stanley railed against 
the media’s tendency to frame student protest as a 
threat to freedom of speech, rather than as students 
engaged in its exercise. Harper added that students 
of color on predominantly white campuses are often 
silent in response to the racism they experience at the 
hands of their professors or peers. Now that these voices 
are finally being heard, he said, they should be cele­
brated, rather than criticized.

In round two, the debaters engaged in crossfire: 
Kaminer insisted that Stanley and Harper mischarac­
terized her argument as anti-protest. The problem, she 
said, was not that students were protesting, but rather 
that the protesters were demanding more robust speech 
codes—official campus policies that limit and restrict 
what one can say—which she views as demonstrative of 
a dangerous new turn toward “speech policing.”

But Harper, who, along with McWhorter, was one of 
the two black debaters, insisted in a booming voice that 
students of color don’t want speech codes. “They want 
the curriculum to reflect their humanity. They want 
the consciousness of their professors and their peers to 
be raised so that people don’t do this to future gener­
ations of students of color on their campuses. That’s 
what they want. They don’t say a thing to me about 
speech codes.” 

Yale’s history seems to confirm Harper’s claim: 
while students have been debating the merits of “free 
speech” for centuries—an 1887 issue of the Yale Daily 
News announced a Phi Beta Kappa debate on the 
topic: “Absolutely free speech is not in the best inter­
ests of society”—the need for an explicit free speech 
protocol did not arise until the late twentieth century. 
Even then, it was the administration, not students, who 
brought the policy to the table.

That policy, the 1974 Woodward Report, was over a 
decade in the making. In 1963, after the widely pub­
licized bombing of a Birmingham church, University 
Provost Kingman Brewster requested that the Yale 
Political Union withdraw its invitation of Alabama 
governor George Wallace, an ardent segregationist. 
Brewster’s decision, which he maintained was in the 
interest of maintain positive town-gown relations, was 
highly criticized by both students and other University 
officials. 

In 1974, Stanford physicist and infamous eugeni­
cist William Shockley was invited to speak at the Yale
