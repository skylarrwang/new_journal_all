Can Three Sheets create a “gastrodive” for everyone?
Chris Cappello 
“Brunch hasn’t worked out for us, so we do lunch,” 
says Rick Seiden, founder of the New Haven bar and 
restaurant Three Sheets. Ed Turschmann, who co-owns 
the establishment with Seiden, pipes in to clarify. “The 
menu is the same.” The two men exchange a brief look, 
as though they have given away the game: what sep­
arates their bar from its peers is not offering but atti­
tude. Box 63 does brunch a few blocks down. So does 
Barracuda. But although a customer inclined towards 
day drinking can get a burger and a beer around noon 
on a Sunday at Three Sheets, no one’s going to call it 
brunch.

Both burly and Connecticut-born, Seiden and Tur­
schmann look like the kind of middle-aged men you 
wouldn’t want to fight, least of all in their own bar. 
When they founded Three Sheets in December 2013 
after the previous tenant, Elm Bar, closed up shop, they 
pledged to bring back the spirit of an older neighbor­
hood institution: Rudy’s Bar and Grille, which occu­
pied their location at 372 Elm Street for seventy-six 
years before moving to a new space on Chapel. “It felt 
like the local place that anybody could go,” Seiden says 
of Rudy’s. “Grad students, fishermen, people from the 
hospital. The place that everybody felt comfortable 
coming into.”

When Rudy’s changed location in 2011, it became a 
“gastropub”—a term, Seiden insists, that doesn’t apply 
to Three Sheets. “That has a completely different con­
notation,” he adds, when asked how his bar’s preferred 
label,“gastrodive,” differs. “This place still has the feel 
of a local dive bar, but the food that comes out of it is 
far superior.” 

With its blue and red neon sign, grimy brick exte­
rior, and dark-tinted windows, Three Sheets certainly 
looks like a dive. Seiden and Turschmann, who were 
both employed in the commercial fishing industry for 
decades, chose the name from an old sailor’s phrase 
for drunkenness—“three sheets to the wind.” Above 
an open doorway, a Pabst Blue Ribbon sign advertises 
“COLD BEER.” There are no TVs. 

When I walk into Three Sheets on a weekday night, 
the atmosphere feels almost utopic. Seiden claims that 
Three Sheets draws both the “suit and tie crowd” and 
“the punk rock crowd.” Sure enough, I run into both 
as I sit at the bar. Next to me, a man with tattoos and 
gauges reads All The Light We Cannot See over a pint 
of stout. Two students in Yale apparel are doing home­
work on laptops at a side table.

But other elements of the bar seem to contradict 
the owners’ claims to non-pretension. An illuminated 
screen shows Chef Kam Tom’s daily kitchen specials, 
which today feature something called a “butter burger” 
(twelve dollars, with beef from Four Mile River farm 
in Old Lyme, Connecticut). A wall-to-wall chalkboard, 
decked out with illustrations in the style of traditional 
military tattoos, displays an ever-changing slate of 
draught beers, most of which cost upwards of $6—
steep for a neighborhood like Dwight, and for an estab­
lishment that calls itself a dive. It’s unclear, as Three 
Sheets enters its third year of operations, whether it is 
defying the winds of change or sailing on them.

When Seiden and Turschmann were regulars at the 
original Rudy’s in the early nineties, New Haven’s com­
mercial district looked different. On Broadway alone, 
you could catch a movie at York Square Cinemas, an 
independent theater, or browse for records at Cutler’s 
after grabbing a cheap meal at the Yankee Doodle. 
Now, your options are more limited—want to hit the 
Apple Store this afternoon? How about J. Crew?

The bar scene is different now, too. In 2013, the 
upscale pub Ordinary replaced Richter’s Bar, a Chapel 
Street dive that closed in 2011 after twenty-eight years. 
Last year, outcry over the closure of the Anchor—a 
College Street staple for over eighty years—led to a 
July 2015 proposal to reopen the bar under new man­
agement. The New Haven Register reports that the new 
Anchor will rebrand itself as an “upscale cocktail bar,” 
a far cry from its origins as a dive.

Although Three Sheets perhaps isn’t a traditional 
dive bar, its owners see their focus on craft beer and 
locally sourced food as part of their creative vision 
rather than the result of a city-wide trend towards the 
upscale. “I don’t think we’re part of that whole chang­
ing scene,” says Seiden. He prefers to think of the bar 
as an “off-Broadway” operation. 

The bar doesn’t feel upscale. “I like that Three Sheets 
has all this great stuff—a deep beer list, good food—but 
in an unpretentious space,” says Dan Michelson ’17, a 
Three Sheets regular. “The bartenders are friendly, the 
crowd is diverse, and everyone just gets along.” In the 
back room, I run into Jon Stone, a local singer-song­
writer who seems to be drawn to town-gown contact 
zones. Last year, at a WYBC-sponsored house show, 
Stone memorably instructed the crowd—roughly split 
between locals and Yalies—to “paint the floor with 
Yalie blood.”

No such rancor tonight. He alludes to an altercation 
at a show at Three Sheets a few weeks back—something 
involving an aggressive guy in a metal band who’d put 
back a few too many—but he’s hesitant to get specific. 
He’s moving to Philadelphia in a couple days, and for 
now, he just wants to drink beer and play pool, to savor 
his last moments as an Elm City resident. Three Sheets 
was the obvious choice for Stone’s impromptu send-
off. “It’s been real,” he’d posted on Facebook earlier 
that day. “I’ll be at Three Sheets tonight if you wanna 
hang.” 

Turschmann is in charge of the draught lines. Their 
sixteen spouts gleam under the bar light. “Sixteen lines 
is good,” he estimates. “I’d rather have twenty, but it’s 
enough.” He prides himself on providing a diverse 
selection, but he makes sure one beer is always avail­
able on tap: Sea Hag, an  IPA from Woodbridge, Con­
necticut. 

Why Sea Hag? Turschmann laughs. “That’s like the 
Budweiser of New Haven,” he says. “If you’re a bar in 
New Haven and you don’t have Sea Hag…” He trails 
off, rolling his eyes. “It’s a great local beer,” Seiden 
clarifies. “Everybody knows it in town, and everybody 
likes it, pretty much.” 

As I sip my pint of Sea Hag, I sense that Seiden’s 
statement resonates beyond the hoppy drink lapping 
at my glass’s brim. In its two and a half years at 372 
Elm Street, Three Sheets has carved out its own niche 
within New Haven’s fluctuating nightlife. And yet, 
Seiden and Turschmann’s hopes for a truly cross-class 
clientele elude them—it’s hard to imagine that the 
people drinking at Three Sheets represent most of New 
Haven. After all, a Sea Hag still runs you six dollars.
