**Title: WHAT'S IN A GAME END NOTE Finding New Haven in BORDERLANDS, pistol in hand**
**Author: Elena Saavedra Buckley**
**Page number(s): 41-42**

Early on in BORDERLANDS, I pick up a pink gun 
called the “Lady Finger” from behind a grave. It’s a 
curvy, single-barreled pistol, and I grip it in my right 
hand’s fingerless glove. When I press “tab” to look at its 
specs, the words “Omnia vincit amor” (“Love conquers 
all”) pop up in red. I, Lilith—a Human Siren from the 
planet Dionysus—store it in my backpack, next to my 
submachine gun, and continue towards New Haven.

The Lady Finger quickly becomes my favorite 
weapon, mostly because its magnifying scope lets me 
shoot enemies from far away. I can feel safe from a 
distance and clever from the periphery, standing on a 
sandy cliff or crouching behind a sheet of rusty metal. 
Things get complicated, though, when I’m attacked by 
“skags,” the resident pests of BORDERLANDS, which 
look like mutant wild dogs. They run great distances to 
attack me, and a scope doesn’t help much when one’s 
gnawing at my legs.

Up-close encounters are an unavoidable part of the 
road to New Haven, the virtual city I’m trying to reach 
on the planet Pandora. It’s a part of the universe of 
BORDERLANDS, the popular role-playing, first-per­
son shooter video game made by Gearbox Software 
in 2009. BORDERLANDS’s version of New Haven is 
described online as:
…the zone and town that is located in a vast junkyard 
between The Dahl Headlands and The Rust Com­
mons West. It was founded by the former inhabitants 
of what is now Old Haven.

Old Haven is currently occupied by The Crimson 
Lance, a private military force that took over after “the 
colonization of Pandora went bad.” The BORDER­
LANDS story exists in the aftermath of that turn, which 
happened when rumors of an ancient vault filled with 
alien weapon technology went public. 

I start a single-player game with the purple-haired 
Lilith, the only female avatar. She was cast out of New 
Haven by a cyborg named Wilhelm. I—we—jump off 
a rickety bus in a town called Fyrestone and begin our 
journey to her old home. 

My desire to reach New Haven comes from an incan­
descent hope that the virtual New Haven will parallel 
the real-life city. The only nod towards Connecticut on 
the BORDERLANDS Wikia is in the “Trivia” section, 
which reads: “The famous Winchester Repeating Arms 
Company was located in ‘New Haven,’ Connecticut,” 

meaning the only obvious connection between the 
virtual city and its real-life counterpart is “guns.”  But 
part of me still believes that unlocking the BORDER­
LANDS map could, in turn, unlock a crucial part of this 
city’s character.

Lilith, New Haven, and the entire BORDERLANDS 
universe first existed in the head of Matthew Armstrong. 
He was the lead designer of BORDERLANDS and 
BORDERLANDS 2, and while he left Gearbox Soft­
ware a year ago for what he tweeted were “new adven­
tures,” he hasn’t forgotten the games. After getting in 
touch with him (on Twitter) and telling him about my 
quest to New Haven, we exchange a series of emails—
he doesn’t respond to requests for a phone call. His 
answers are always written in orange. (“Because they’re 
LEGENDARY,” he explains.) 

“The theme of BORDERLANDS has always been 
‘isolated people finding family,’” he wrote. “Mind you, 
this is in the middle of people shooting and killing and 
acting all crazy, but that’s just the fun coating on the 
outside.” Traveling across barren landscapes, I along 
with other Vault Hunters are at the mercy of stoic rock 
formations, apocalyptic decay, and endless skags. Brief 
moments of safety serve as stepping stones to the trea­
sure. 

“New Haven is home,” Armstrong writes me when 
I ask about its place in the game. “You really want the 
player to feel a connection to the hubs because that 
adds some bit of weight to the combat.” That connec­
tion is difficult for the designers, though. It forces them 
to quickly forge a sense of belonging before the player 
moves onto the next location, especially since the map 
is a mystery until a player reaches it. 

While the game starts out with simple missions, it gets 
tough when I have to confront “bosses,” the more pow­
erful villains blocking the way to new locations. I tell 
Armstrong that I’m having trouble defeating the brawny 
Bone Head, and he cautions me that there’s more to it 
than the final result. 

BORDERLANDS, he says, is more than just its 
“golden path” of Main Quests. To advance, I have to 
complete Side Quests, too. They don’t lead me to New 
Haven directly, but with each completed Side Quest, 
I become a more integrated resident of Pandora. After 
collecting some magical seeds for a friend in Skag Gully, 
I level up. I approach Bone Head from behind, destroy 
his shield with two shots to the head, and take him down 
with a couple close-range bullets. I realize that I can’t 
get by with keeping at a distance, such as that allowed 
by the Lady Finger—I can’t play BORDERLANDS if I 
don’t interact with the world of it. 

After leaving Fyrestone, I make it to the Dahl Head­
lands. It’s more of a dingy campout than a civilized 
settlement, crawling with tiny axe-wielding men called 
“psychos.” I’m right outside the gate to New Haven, but 
now, the gate is locked. When I defeat Mad Mel in a 
flaming monster truck stadium, a robot called a claptrap 
leads me to the barrier. It types in a code with its insect 
arms, and I teleport inside.  

In New Haven, houses have decayed into landfill 
heaps. The sky droops in chemical yellow, held up by 
smoke stacks. After passing under a corroded metal arch, 
I wander through what used to be a town intersection, 
where characters loiter in front of makeshift shacks. I 
can press “E” to talk to them—“Ever thought about 
settling down? We could use someone like you around 
here,” one says. The supplies I previously found in high-
tech boxes now hide in old washing machines. Nothing 
here is familiar to me. The streets made of packed dirt 
and are nothing like the ones I use to get to class. 

“We didn’t name it after New Haven,” Armstrong 
writes. The map is merely “an early town in a dangerous 
frontier,” meant to give “a sense of safety and provide a 
reminder about the town the settlers left behind.” 

I’m disappointed, but not surprised. I’m not even sure 
how the New Haven I know could be communicated 
through a desert landscape, especially an animated one. 
Even in a virtual world, there’s no being in two places 
at once, and trying to learn about a real city—the one I 
live in—through the eyes of a video game character is a 
little like trying to use the Lady Finger as an all-purpose 
weapon: clumsy. 

But even without the familiarity, I feel sustainably 
safe. Skags, bandits, and psychos don’t flood out of every 
open door. For the first time, no one wants to kill me. I 
make myself at home.
