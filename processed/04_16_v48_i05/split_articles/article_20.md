EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
months of his appointment in 2010, House staff, 
headed by Allison Robinson and Ivy Onyeador, wrote 
a letter to the Dean’s office about Cohen’s pattern of 
regularly missing staff meetings, not coming to student 
events, and failing to approve the undergraduate staff’s 
hours so that they could be paid. (Cohen could not be 
reached for comment for this story.)


In the words of this staff in 2010, “Dean Cohen’s 
performance as Director of the House has been at best, 
lackluster, and at worst, appalling. He has presented a 
pattern of inconsistency, unreliability and lack of lead­
ership that we haven’t experienced before, driving us to 
seek advice and guidance elsewhere.”


When I arrived as a freshman in 2012, I saw these 
problems persist. I had entered into the midst of a 
debate that began with that letter, which in turn intro­
duced me to alumni like Bisa Williams, who came 
back to the House in the fall of 2014. Their dismay 
at the disorganized state of the House community 
reopened a familiar wound. We had watched the 
Black student leaders  before us struggle over what to 
do about Cohen’s tenure, and as a result, Micah and I 
made ousting Cohen a priority.


The previous board produced a petition asking for 
Cohen to be “retrained” in the spring of 2014, but 
there was no response from Yale College adminis­
trators Dean Mary Miller, Dean of Student Affairs 
Marichal Gentry, or Vice President for Student Life 
Kimberly Goff-Crews. If administrators, two Black and 
one white, would not respond to communication from 
Black students, then it was time to stop asking and start 
demanding. The Yale we were contending with was no 
longer the gentleman’s club of the House’s founding 
years, but an unresponsive bureaucracy. 


Since its founding in 1969, Black activism has kept 
the House alive. Through the leadership of Armstead 
Robinson ’68, Don Ogilvie ’68, and Glen DeChabert 
’70 (collectively known as “the Founders”), the House, 
then called Afro America Inc., was established at 1195 
Chapel Street. By 1970, the House moved to 211 Park 
St., the former Chi Psi fraternity house, and was reno­
vated in 1971.


The BSAY board at the time had asked for a Black 
Cultural Center as a refuge from the pervasive white­
ness of Yale life. Early in the 1969 spring term, BSAY 
sent President Kingman Brewster a letter demanding 
the founding of a BCC by September of the same year. 
The letter also reflected the many needs that Black stu­
dents hoped the BCC would fulfill, including money 
for a part time coordinator of the center (approved by 
BSAY and the Afro American Study Group), a Black 
freshman counseling program, and help from the 
administration to obtain outside funding for social 
action.


In September of 1969, Black students got their BCC. 
Soon, they would just call it “the House.” While win­
ning Afro America Inc. and the African American Stud­
ies Department in 1969 were hard-fought victories, 
they inaugurated a battle over resources—necessary 
to allow the space to thrive—that would continue for 
decades.


The University’s actions have historically starved the 
house of financial and human resources. Every year 
since its founding, the director has had to struggle to 
make sure the House and its many member groups 
have enough money to operate successfully. 


In the House’s early years in the nineteen-seven­
ties, Black students attempted to transfer their Student 
Activities Fee from their residential colleges to the 
House, as they felt unwelcome at college parties, like 
one with a “Klan Party” theme in 1982. When the Stu­
dent Activities Fee was reconfigured, the House had to 
start charging membership fees to Black students and 
even higher fees to students who came for individual 
events. 


Yale has also historically been stingy with resources 
for the physical structure of the House. In 1989, house 
Director Melvin Wade had to spend the beginning 
of the school year making sure that the University 
removed the last of the asbestos that had been partially 
dealt with in the summer. Even worse, according to 
Wade, the University had not brought the building up 
to code since 1928. 


Upon returning to Yale for the thirtieth anniversary 
of the House in 1999, the Black alumni were morti­
fied by the state of the building that they had worked 
so hard to maintain. Dean Pamela George described 
her first impression when she walked into the space as 
its new director in 2000: “It was terrible. I cried. The 
rats, the roaches, praying that a roach didn’t come out 
while we were having an event—I hope I killed the last 
roach. The buckets, because the roof was leaking all 
over the place. It was horrible.”


What happened to the roaches, the mice, and the 
leaking roof? The alumni got fed up. With George on 
board, they began a capital campaign to renovate the 
House. By the thirty-fifth anniversary celebration in 
2004, the entire basement had been redone, an archive 
for the House had been established, and there was an 
endowment for Black student leadership development 
named the ORD Fund after the founders of the House: 
Ogilvie, Robinson, and DeChabert.


But starting in 2010, at the beginning of Dean 
Cohen’s term, the gains reversed. The kitchen, like in 
2000, became barely useable. A large rug in the main 
room covered a wooden floor that needed repair. The 
library, which used to boast countless books about 
Black history and culture, was nearly empty. More 
importantly, the House began to empty of people, as 
Black students saw the House as a less welcoming place. 


To make matters worse, the Yale administration 
decided to merge the “House directorship” position 
with an “assistant deanship” in the early nineteen-nine­
ties, emphasizing the job’s connection to the Yale Col­
lege Dean’s Office. This balancing act is not only tax­
ing for the director, but also for the Black students who 
have to compete for the director’s time. Community 
building and direct interaction with Black students 
dropped on the list of priorities. George was one of 
the first directors who had to navigate the change. She 
commented on the risk of a director becoming isolated 
within the administration, away from the House and its 
members. “Before you know it,” she said, “something’s 
fallen apart.” 


While Micah and I organized under Dean Cohen, 
figures from the House’s past took notice. In the fall 
of 2014, the administration told all the cultural cen­
ters that they would receive external reviews. The ears 
of Black alumni, who had witnessed similar processes 
before, immediately pricked up. 


While the other directors of the three other cultural 
centers had notified their students about the review, 
Dean Cohen did not alert the House members. Upon 
hearing that Black students knew nothing of the Uni­
versity’s plans, alumna Kim Hershman ’88 sent House 
leaders an urgent email notifying them about the stu­
dent forum portion of the review process. 


After the initial open forum in November, the admin­
istration had planned two more forums in early Febru­
ary 2015. Micah and I decided that one of these was 
the moment to publicly call for Cohen’s resignation. 


For several weeks, we went to groups in the Black com­
munity, urging them to sign the petition for Cohen’s 
removal. Not everyone did. Some students were afraid 
that a petition was too aggressive, and others didn’t feel 
compelled to say anything because they knew nothing 
about Cohen—which, we argued, was a reflection of 
his absence from the House. 


Ultimately, the Black Men’s Union rejected the peti­
tion, the only Black student group to do so out of the 
five that had connections to the majority of the House 
community. 


We decided to confront the rift head-on. Micah met 
with the President of the BMU, Will Searcy ’16, and he 
said he understood that Dean Cohen’s conduct, which 
to some appeared most invested in Yale’s Black men, 
harmed the community. In the petition, seven women 
had relayed experiences of sexism with Cohen. But the 
general body of the BMU still voted the motion down. 
Searcy said he saw rifts in attitudes toward the peti­
tion. When the BMU decided not to sign on, he said, 
it wasn’t out of disagreement with its organizational 
goals—the BMU agreed with wanting more financial 
transparency, clarifying the membership system, and 


The last five years of struggle stripped the House of its 
home-like feeling. Sometimes I wonder about what came out 
of our fight for the House. With the hiring of Dean Risë Nelson, 
and with the energy brought by the March of Resilience, we are 
beginning to rebuild.
