extra-long limb. Perhaps more notably, blue fabric 
with characters from the Mickey Mouse Club House 
is laminated into the surface of his prosthesis. It’s a full 
Disney panorama, from cargo shorts to running shoes. 
“People make fun of the Mickey leg,” Hondo says 
with a grin. They also made fun of his previous choices, 
Nemo and Taz, but he doesn’t give a damn. He tells 
people his wife helped him pick the decoration. She 
was a student at Hondo’s former workplace, Newington 
Children’s Hospital, and they were married at the Dis­
ney World wedding pavilion several years later. He tells 
kids, though, that it’s his “Magic Foot.”


Hondo’s name comes from a six-foot-five basketball 
superstar who used to play for the Celtics. Hondo’s par­
ents stopped calling him Andrew—his legal name—
when he was 2 years old. A sporty nickname seemed 
more fitting for this wild, rambunctious boy, though 
Hondo does not exactly resemble the Celtic’s John 
“Hondo” Havlicek. “He’d literally go from one end of 
the court to the other,” Hondo says of his Celtics name­
sake, “and I guess I was a little terror.” 
His mother believes the Dalkon Shield, an intra-uter­
ine device that led to thousands of lawsuits in the 
nineteen-seventies, caused Hondo’s congenital limb 
defect. But she has no proof, only numbers. After the 
FDA pulled the product from the shelves, women who 
filed for damages won nearly $2.5 billion. They spoke 
in courts about inflammatory pelvic infections, septic 
abortions, and a few cases of death. One lost foot was 
not out of the question. 

Hondo tells me about his time as a point guard on 
the basketball court, flank on the soccer field, pitcher 
and first baseman on the baseball diamond. He wasn’t 
worried about what would happen if he ran around, 
and it showed: between the ages of 1 and 13, Hondo 
broke many prosthetic legs. At age 6, he snapped his 
ankle in two at his parents’ beach cottage in Old Lyme, 
Connecticut. His father accidentally glued his foot on 
backwards, and they had to drive all the way back to the 
hospital to have the technicians put it back together. 
Hondo doesn’t have all that much to say about his 
leg, because as far as he’s concerned, he’s just a “nor­
mal family guy”—the kind who goes home to a small 
house with a wife and a 3-year-old kid, who tunes in to 
fox or The Walking Dead, and who goes motor boating 
in his 22-foot Sea Ray on weekends. He likes the boat 
for the freedom, and the saltwater, and the feeling of 
being out on the ocean. But he adds that maneuvering 
with rudimentary prosthetic technology when he was a 
child was not easy. 

His early prostheses teetered on a foam foot and 
included an adjustable socket bound by Velcro straps. 
“People thought I was always limited,” he says. But 
then they’d see him play.
His older siblings treated him gently (not just because 
he was the youngest), and they stood up for him if any 
other kids turned mean. But Hondo says they didn’t 
have much work to do: “I always stood up for myself. 
I never got bullied or anything.” Now, his sister works 
for Hallmark and his brother works for an insurance 
company—the ultimate disaster response team. 

Hondo got into the prosthetics business because, 
after high school, it seemed pragmatic, and he was 
always good with his hands. Newington Orthotic & 
Prosthetic Systems, where he was certified as a tech­
nician, functioned alongside the children’s hospital 
where he had gotten his first prosthetic. He stayed on 
until the company was bought out by Hanger, Inc. “I 
have a love of helping people get their lives on track,” 
he says. “It’s just nice to see people walk again.”
Hondo’s lucky, by some standards: the fact that he’s 
been footless since birth means that his leg muscles 
aren’t shrinking. Unlike the bodies of many amputees, 
his is not in a constant state of flux. When his leg irri­
tates him, he makes a few adjustments instead of mak­
ing a new socket.
But prostheses’ life spans are limited. “This is my old 
foot,” Hondo says, pulling out a glossy black piece of 
carbon shaped like a tiny children’s slide. Though he 
now does lay-ups only when he’s visiting his nephews 
in Southington, Connecticut, he strains his prosthe­
sis by working hard each day. “When carbon snaps, 
it makes a pop—a real, loud pop,” he says, looking at 
the old Freedom Innovations foot that he stores at the 
workshop. “Seven years on it, and it finally broke.”


Mass-produced feet, mass-produced knees, and 
mass-produced joints provide mobility to over 1.6 mil­
lion U.S. amputees. Fewer than two thousand are vet­
erans who have fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. The 
majority are elderly individuals who have lost circula­
tion and often end up in the hospital for vascular dis­
eases. People in traumatic accidents are a close second. 
More than two hundred American artificial limb 
manufacturers were at the ready when the first shots 
of World War I were fired. The mom-and-pop opera­
tions that once shipped arms and legs across the coun­
try have since closed. Big players like New England 
Orthotic and Prosthetics Systems—the second-largest 
O&P company in the country—have taken over the 
supply chain. 

Mac Hanger, a physician who comes to the fabrica­
tion center to adjust patients’ molds, is the great-grand­
son of the Civil War’s first amputee. His great-grandfa­
ther started Hanger, Inc., NEOPS’s biggest competitor,

after a cannonball tore off his leg at the Battle of 
Philippi. Surgeons at that time wiped their knives on 
aprons in preparation for the next man, and chloroform 
didn’t always dampen the pain. But you could make a 
sturdy enough leg out of barrel wood, and the young 
man did just that. He then made his money off of the 
war’s thirty-five thousand amputees. For an above-the-
knee prosthesis, the going rate at the time was two hun­
dred dollars.
Brand-name legs became part of American business. 
The Selpho Leg, which was originally made with cat­
gut tendons, arrived from London in 1839. The E-Z- 
Leg, or Liberty Leg, became all the rage in the sum­
mer of 1918. Woodrow Wilson’s National Defense Act 
funded the creation of an Artificial Limb Laboratory 
to account for the four thousand amputees that stum­
bled out of World War I. White willow wood, which 
had been dried over years, was once the most popular 
option (until too many maimed men stayed alive for 
the trees to keep pace). 

After World War II, the veterans who spurred many 
of the advances of the industry were the same guys who 
appeared in instructional manuals with their hands on 
their hips and their pants rolled up, or in army archives 
with a lit cigarette. In Artificial Parts, Practical Lives, 
communications professor David Serlin argues that the 
U.S. media used amputees to glamorize postwar patri­
otism and combat the public’s concerns about fragile 
American families. 

Prostheses became symbols of masculinity lost and 
found. The Philadelphia Inquirer raised more than 
$50,000 for an army private who lost all his comrades 
and limbs in a Pacific Ocean plane crash in World War 
II. Other newspapers featured him posing with Miss 
America in a GM car specially made for amputees. 
Academy-Award-winning films like “The Best Years of 
Our Lives” told the tale of a veteran named Homer 
with mechanical-hook hands. He married the darling 
next door by the time the credits rolled.
The attitudes toward people with disabilities have 
changed rapidly since the nineteen-forties, now that 
Olympic athletes and sexy models have borrowed the 
mantle of military men. Cheetah-like feet allow run­
ners to sprint forward, and adjustable ankles let high-
heel wearers out on the town. But America’s image of 
amputees remains inextricably linked to war. For men 
like Hondo, the awkwardness of the association is hard 
to escape.
“Thank you for your service,” a man said when 
Hondo took his daughter to Dunkin’ Donuts for a

breakfast sandwich in November. He was not the first; 
an army veteran had recently spotted Hondo’s leg at 
Walgreens and congratulated its owner for heroism. 
Such mistakes happen all the time, and Hondo replies 
without pause.
“I was born without a foot,” Hondo tells them. He 
teaches them about the prosthetics businesses, describ­
ing his days at a workshop that many never even knew 
existed. He’s easy-going about it, unwilling to make a 
fuss. “I wouldn’t know what to do with a real foot.”


The door of the hulking oven opens and a billow 
of heat tumbles out. Hondo’s gloved hand grasps the 
melted ProFlex inside the 400° Fahrenheit cave. As 
Hondo lifts the metal ring around the sheet, the cen­
ter of the plastic gives in to gravity. It resembles, for 
a moment, a perfectly transparent bowl suspended in 
midair. 
Muscles cannot push; they can only pull or stop pull­
ing. The muscles that use force to contract are called 
the “agonists,” whereas the muscles that resist are the 
“antagonists.” As Hondo stretches the plastic over the 
plaster mold, he leans forward; the muscles in his back, 
in his arms, in his legs shift into position. He begins to 
pull, pull, pull.
When the plastic cools, he covers it with sock-like 
layers of black carbon mesh and white fiberglass. A 
vacuum-sucked PVC plastic stretches around the bun­
dle, making it look like cream frosting in a cake-dec­
orating bag. The Kingsley Manufacturing Company’s 
color options include Caucasian, Dark Caucasian, 
Light Caucasian, 4A Medium Brown, 7A Dark Brown, 
Latin, Oriental, and Snow White (which Hondo says 
they don’t buy). He pours a mixture of paint and epoxy 
into a cut-off Mountain Dew container at the top of the 
bag. The finished stumps resemble a cluster of giants’ 
thumbs on the metal-top table. 

But the cosmetic process is far from over. “People 
don’t want to look at a pylon, you know what I mean?” 
Hondo says. He wraps a piece of foam around the leg 
because he wants to make a shape resembling a lifelike 
calf. The grinder emits an angry squeal every time it 
makes contact. 

A seam of yellow glue along the back of the foam 
looks like a bad stocking seam, and the edges near the 
ankle are frayed like the fabric on the end of an old 
t-shirt. But Hondo inspects the leg meticulously: if he 
gets the angles of the foam just right, people might not 
notice that CPI 26 is printed on the bottom of the plas­
tic foot shell, or that the ankle only bends so far. 

When Hondo picks up his 3-year-old, Faith, from 
daycare at the end of the day and brings her home, 
bits of this leg will come with him. “I’m just constantly 
washing my hands, and the plaster’s drying my palms 
up even worse,” he says. Tiny shards of fiberglass turn 
his hands redder each day. Shreds of carbon slip under 
the skin. “That stuff’s—ooh—that stuff’s no good 
either.” He shudders. “That stuff’s so fine that once it 
gets on you, it itches the crap out of you.” 

He’s so busy looking at other people’s legs all day, 
or doting on his child, that he scarcely pays attention 
to his own leg. Though he had to order a new foot, he 
hasn’t bothered to replace the rest of his prosthesis in 
the past seven years; most people make a change after 
just three. His wife’s father, a physician in the prosthet­
ics business, will probably fit him for a new leg when 
the current one breaks. 

“It’s like the mechanic driving a crappy car, and the 
shoe repairman whose kids have holes in their shoes,” 
he says.
His wife, Sara, grew up understanding artificial body 
parts. Her uncle lost his leg in a farming-machine acci­
dent at age 10 and started a family prosthetics business 
as a young man. Before she started work at a medical 
supply company, she learned to make prosthetics at 
Newington Children’s Hospital. The first practice leg 
she made was for Hondo, far before she got to know 
him. First tries are often rough-hewn and chafe the 
skin, but he gritted his teeth and said, “Oh, it’s great!” 
when he fit it on. 

 “What was happening when daddy got this? Do you 
remember?” Sara asks Faith, as the child plays with 
a stuffed dog with floppy brown ears. Hondo’s grand­
mother gifted him the dog on the day of his first foot 
surgery.
“No,” Faith says, blond curls falling into her face. 
She’s got her father’s endless energy and a second 
foot to propel her. She squirms in her seat and holds 
Patches in her arms.
“That’s just the way it is,” Sara says.
Hondo watches Faith climb onto the table before 
she’s escorted to bed. He might one day tell her that, 
in his surgery room, he slept in a bed next to a Saudi 
prince’s son. He might laugh when he admits that he 
got kicked out of the play area for crawling over other 
kids with his cast. He might mention what it’s like to 
walk around with the daily assistance of plastic and tita­
nium and carbon. But for now, none of that matters. 
Faith just knows that not every kid has a father with a 
Mickey Mouse leg.
