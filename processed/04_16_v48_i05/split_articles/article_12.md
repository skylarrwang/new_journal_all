THE  NEW  JOURNAL
Bryan Buckley, a lanky 23-year-old wedding photog­
rapher and welder from New Bedford, Massachusetts, 
pulls into the parking lot of the Winchester Lofts in his 
red Volkswagen. He is not interested in the new loft 
apartments but in the decaying walls and boarded-up 
windows immediately adjacent to them. He wears a 
hoodie, jeans, and a baseball cap. His face is smooth 
and boyish. He takes out his phone and pulls up a sat­
ellite image of the block on which we’re parked, which 
shows the sections of collapsed roof and incongruous 
green foliage that first drew him to this spot. In this 
building, during World War II, New Haveners built 
the Nazi-defeating successors to the Winchester Model 
1873—“the gun that won the West.” 

Buckley is an urban explorer, or “urbexer”—a mem­
ber of an informal, global community of people who 
spend weekends and evenings visiting structures that 
are closed to the public. Some urbexers break into 
subway tunnels or onto rooftops, but Buckley falls into 
a more history-minded camp. He prefers abandoned 
landmarks like factories and mental asylums. He posts 
his photographs to his website, Instagram account, and 
Facebook page under the shared title Vanishing New 
England, and labels the photographs with hashtags like 
“#dark #decay #grime #newengland” so fellow urbexers 
can find them. He even deploys a bot to “Like” photos 
with urbex-related hashtags and encourage their post­
ers to follow his own account. In this niche post-indus­
trial economy, Buckley is a shrewd businessman.

He is only one of many who have visited the Win­
chester factory over the past decade and taken pho­
tographs of molding floors, busted urinals, an empty 
elevator shaft, and light shining hopefully through 
crumbling walls. In online spaces named Nostalgic 
Memoir, Abandonedforgotten, and Abandoned Con­
necticut a visual catalog of the factory’s past decade has 
steadily accumulated. UrbEx-style photographs of the 
factory have even graced the pages of this magazine, as 
a photo collage in 2012. 

From the photographs, you get the sense that when 
the factory doors closed in the early 1980s, history 
stopped. Time and the elements moved on by them­
selves, eroded paint and rusted metal with only the 
occasional graffiti artist for an audience. But in real­
ity, Winchester continued to evolve. In 2012, student 
financial services firm Higher One spent $46 million to 
open new offices in part of the building. In 2014, real 
estate company Forest City began leasing 158 apart­
ment units—the Winchester Lofts—with a marketing 
strategy heavy on history. The website claims that “at 
the intersection of past and present, genuine craft is 
evident in every element,” and promises a “feeling of 
authenticity … when you step into your apartment.” 

Soon, those same developers will begin construction 
on another two hundred apartment units, with an out­
door pool and a bocce court. When that happens, the 
Winchester Repeating Arms Factory’s brief but prolific 
second life as a New Haven urban exploration destina­
tion will come to a final close. Buckley is here to docu­
ment this liminal space, the fast-closing period of aban­
donment between the assembly lines, the jobs and the 
guns of the twentieth century, and the concrete-floor 
master bedrooms, the doggie bathtubs, and the pilates 
machines of the twenty-first. 

—
In its general outline, the story of the Winchester 
Repeating Arms Factory is distinctly American: hum­
ble beginnings, rapid expansion fueled by violence and 
machines, a labor force of immigrants, a triumphant 
peak at World War II, a decades-long afterglow, and 
then the steady decline of an economy that made many 
things, but mostly our image of ourselves.  

The factory was first built in 1870, two decades after 
its founder, Oliver Fisher Winchester, arrived in New 
Haven and entered the manufacturing business. The 
company established itself in 1866 with a repeating 
rifle that outpaced the competition and won fans the

world over. In 1908, the Hartford Courant reported 
that President Theodore Roosevelt ordered four differ­
ent types of rifles for a hunting trip in Africa. During 
World War I, European demand for rifles fed demand 
for labor at the area’s gun factories, including Win­
chester; in 1915, twelve thousand machinist positions 
had to be filled to churn out one hundred million dol­
lars’ worth of guns. “Everything booming in the Elm 
City,” said the headlines. 

Winchester’s workforce reached 21,000 people 
during World War II. Desperate to produce more guns, 
managers overrode the objections of white employees 
to hire African Americans, largely migrants from the 
South. Black newspapers from Atlanta to Chicago cov­
ered the development; for them, working in the factory 
was a victory not only for racial but also for economic 
justice. But the victory was short lived. The sum of all 
factory wages in the city peaked in 1954, and declined 
precipitously after that.  

For Winchester, part of the problem was peace. After 
Korea and Vietnam, by the late nineteen-seventies, 
the factory was losing millions of dollars every year. 
Its parent company, the Olin Corporation, demanded 
major productivity increases from workers, who went 
on strike in 1979. Olin responded by cutting jobs and 
production, shutting down large portions of the factory

and sectioning them off as industrial ruins. 

Winchester was not an anomaly. From the nine­
teen-fifties on, factories across the country laid off 
workers and shut down the machines as management 
shifted production to the South or out of the states. By 
1997, ninety percent of the factory jobs that had existed 
in New Haven in 1954 had disappeared, according to 
Yale political scientist Douglas Rae in his book City: 
Urbanism and Its End. 

The ultimate end came in 2006, when the last two 
hundred workers were laid off and gun production 
ceased forever. The small swath of the Newhallville 
factory then still in operation closed, and the machines 
were auctioned off. On March 31, 2006, New Haven 
made Winchester rifles. On April 1, 2006, it didn’t. 

Buckley pulls out his camera and tripod from the 
VW trunk. A woman and her dog walk into the lofts. 
No one seems to notice as we march across the park­
ing lot towards the boarded-up windows. The ground 
is sandy and littered with cans of Budweiser, glass 
Starbucks Frappuccino bottles, and glossy Fritos bags. 
We turn right at the corner of the building and find a 
red door, a few feet off the ground, with a wood pallet 
leaned against it serving as a ladder. We climb up and 
into the Winchester Repeating Arms Factory.

“Easy,” Buckley says.

The size of the space is jarring; somehow from out­
side the abandonment seems more contained. There 
is a faint trickling sound—the recent snow melting 
into the puddles on the floor. The water laps against 
moss and a grey, flattened shoe. A few pairs of newer, 
cleaner shoes are arranged in tidy rows away from the 
water, perhaps by someone who has no other place to 
put them. 

Both nature and shelter seekers are reclaiming the 
space. But aside from the flora and refuse, Winchester 
is mostly vacant, one of the emptier abandoned build­
ings Buckley has seen. He’s been in offices where 
typewriters still sit on the desks, factories whose break 
rooms still look just as they did on the last day of opera­
tion. What is left behind here is valueless: descriptions 
of gun parts taped onto the walls as guides for employ­
ees, or, in a bathroom piled with crumbling porcelain, 
a paper towel dispenser from which brown paper still 
extends. 

Buckley approaches the urban exploration process 
systematically, aiming to cover every room of every 
site he visits. He’s returned to his favorite spots in New 
Bedford several times over, driven partly, it seems, by a 
desire to claim them. 

 “You want to find places no one has found,” he said. 
“It’s very similar to, like, graffiti in a way. I don’t like 
graffiti artists because they destroy these places. But 
they like to tag their name, show that they’ve been 
there, and we like to take photos and post them online 
to show that we’ve been there.”

This is the kind of voracity—collecting ruined places 
like badges—that some find a troubling aspect of urban 
exploration. The destruction of livelihoods enabled 
this weekend excursion, and there was little trace left 
of the people who toiled here for years as we happily 
snapped pictures. 

In an essay in Guernica in 2011, Wayne State Univer­
sity English professor John Patrick Leary criticizes ruin 
photography in “the Mecca of urban ruins:” Detroit. 
“As a purely aesthetic object, even with the best inten­
tions, ruin photography cannot help but exploit a city’s 
misery; but as political documents on their own, they 
have little new to tell us,” he writes. 

Buckley’s photographs are silent on the subject of 
the poverty that set into Newhallville as manufacturing 
jobs fled the city. On the other hand, Buckley’s pho­
tography may be returning these spaces to the People, 
however niche his actual audience may be. Boarded 
up, the buildings are accessible only to their owners 
and developers surveying potential reuse projects. But 
anyone can visit Vanishing New England to see doz­
ens of photographs of abandoned structures, ranging 
from a train’s dining car to the Remington razor fac­
tory in Bridgeport, to Winchester in New Haven. He 
views himself as a preservationist of sorts, documenting 
industrial America before it disappears. 

“If I have kids and they grow up, they’re not gonna 
see these places,” he says. “They’re gonna be gone. 
America’s never gonna see this again.”
