setting up a structure to hold deans accountable. However, he said that the petition and accompanying letters 
against Cohen “didn’t always focus on problems with 
his effectiveness,” he said. “It was more of a character 
attack. Guys didn’t feel comfortable signing off on that 
because that wasn’t the experience they had with him.” 
From political decisions to social settings, gender 
issues in the Black student body have affected the 
House’s activism since its founding. At a Black Women’s Coalition meeting last spring, I heard an alumna 
talk about being raped by a Black male student in the 
nineteen-seventies. She felt she couldn’t talk about 
it because publicizing the story would undercut the 
Black student movement. How many other Black 
women before and after her had gone through the 
same experience? 

Sexism in the House often operates in activist spaces. 
From Bisa Williams to Caroline Jackson-Smith, who 
served on BSAY’s steering committee in the early seventies, women were often powerful, respected contributors to the activist work of Black Yale, but paternalism 
from male students could diminish their involvement. 
In 1974, Yale senior Warrington Hudlin made a documentary called “Black at Yale.” In one scene, three 
Black women argue with a Black male peer. They’re 
standing on the first floor of the House, filling the 
lobby with their dispute. It’s heated on both sides, but I 
noticed a hint of a smirk on the man’s face when I saw 
the film.
He is so condescending, I thought, watching in the 
booth at the Yale Film Study Center. But maybe I’m 
just imagining it. 

Hudlin then cuts to the same Black man as he speaks 
to another Black male student in an apartment. The 
second Black male student comments on the three 
women—he understands “them” now. They’re “crazy,” 
but “you have to deal with them!” 

One of the women in the scene was Bisa Williams. 
When she took over BSAY in 1975, Williams wanted 
to transform the group’s “petty socializing and political romanticizing” into more disciplined political conduct. In a speech outlining these changes, Williams 
argued that BSAY should work to better “the mental, 
physical, social, and political condition of all people of 
African descent.” In line with that vision, she proposed 
fundamental changes in membership requirements 
for BSAY members. Upset that Williams seemed to be 
abdicating BSAY’s role as a social support for Black students, some members splintered off to form the Black 
Student Union (which ended in 1976). Williams told 
me she believes the split was due less to differing organizational goals and more to men finding female leadership hard to swallow.

The complex tensions between men and women in 
the community haven’t gone away, and they often bubble to the surface during BSAY’s annual meetings on 
gender, which I’ve seen turn into shouting matches. 
At the beginning of our term in 2014, the BSAY board 
billed the year’s conversation as one about gender in 
the Black community, rather than at Yale in general, so 
that dialogue might feel less fraught.

That day, people filled the Lighten Room in the 
basement of the House. More than twenty Black students pulled up chairs while chatting and formed a 
circle, music playing softly in the background. It felt 
normal. 

Then the meeting began. For an hour, only one of 
the many Black men in the room spoke. The rest sat, 
arms crossed, refusing to open their mouths. This was 
not abnormal. Union members often attended BSAY 
meetings in order to combat claims that BMU isolated 
itself from other House organizations, but they rarely 
contributed to meetings. This silence, however, felt 
different. Not disinterest, but disrespect. This meeting 
wasn’t about the BMU. It was about Black men and 
women trying to begin to heal an age-old impasse. 
But what does it mean when the men most resistant 
to engage with the rest of the community are primarily 
BMU members?

Searcy, looking back at the meeting, said the men’s 
silence was not a BMU directive. Rather, he saw the 
meeting as “not an open dialogue.” He recalls feeling 
berated, and he said that his attendance was as a BSAY 
member rather than as a representative of the BMU. 
This was the environment in which we wrote the 
sixty-plus-page petition, which lacked the signatures of 
many black men. After its delivery at the open forum in 
February, we waited. Weeks later, in the midst of spring 
break, I found out that Dean Cohen had resigned. Just 
like that, it was over.

On a March morning, I wake up to the sound of my 
phone. My room is dark. 
“Are you up?” 
It’s Micah. I’m late.
“Sure I am.”
I’m scrambling, searching for clothes, underwear, 
socks. Fuck. Several weeks after we found out Cohen 
had resigned, and yet things still seemed to be in shambles. 

I stop dead. I was supposed to wake up early and 
write a speech for the Unite Yale rally today, a direct 
action aimed at building power among the people 
involved in activism surrounding the neglect of the 
cultural centers, mental health reform, and divesting 
from fossil fuels. I won’t be delivering the speech—I’ve

been replaced by Eli, a Black freshman and future vice 
president of BSAY, because we think my active presence might be counterproductive after my visibility in 
removing Cohen. Eli has a test today, so the task of 
writing her speech has fallen to me.

Micah and I rush to the House. Sitting in the office, 
thinking about how to articulate the importance of our 
recent victory, I think again of Bisa Williams’s advice 
to make it out of Yale, to not do everything ourselves. 
I also think of Larry Irvin—a student who almost did 
not graduate.

Irvin’s story begins in the spring semester of 1974, 
when the Yale Political Union invited William Shockley to debate Congress of Racial Equality President Roy 
Innis. By 1974, Shockley, a 1956 winner of the Nobel 
Prize in physics, had become a eugenicist and would 
speak on his belief that Black people were biologically 
inferior. 

As the day of the talk approached, the Third World 
Coalition, led by BSAY, distributed fliers about the 
protest. Several hundred students crowded outside that 
afternoon while a group of upperclassmen and coalition leaders went inside and shouted Shockley down. 
Yale gave thirteen “judicial penalties” for their participation. One was BSAY moderator Larry Irvin. Yale gave 
the students summer suspensions.

With the immediate threat of Shockley’s inflammatory rhetoric gone, activist attention waned. When Irvin 
returned to school in the fall of 1974, he held several 
meetings in the House, but few people came. He struggled on through the semester, which prompted Yale 
to ask him to take the year off. When the new BSAY 
moderator, Bisa Williams, asked Irvin if he wanted the 
Black community to advocate on his behalf, he said no. 
Irvin finished his degree, but a year late. He was not 
the only casualty of Black student action whose academic trajectory was waylaid by the consequences of 
their activist work. Craig Foster ’73, a key Black leader, 
estimated in an archived interview that of ninety-six to 
one hundred Black seniors in his class, only fifty-five 
graduated.

I do not know Irvin personally. I do not know where 
he is from, and most importantly, I do not know what 
happened to him after. But I understand him. Suddenly, I realize what the speech is about. 

I scrawl it out and speed walk from the House to 
the basement of Bingham where Eli is waiting. We’re 
assembled. Two-hundred and fifty Yale students on 
Cross Campus in front of Sterling Memorial Library—
chanting, clapping, crying. Our hand-painted signs 
catch what little light peeks from behind the clouds. 
One by one, each speaker goes up, many asking their 
communities to come up with them. 

It’s Eli’s turn. She says: 
“Just recently, I found a photo of my Dad taken by 
my Mom while he was here—standing somewhere on 
Beinecke, speaking out in front of Woodbridge Hall. 
It’s students like him—who in the eighties were fighting for divestment from South Africa, […] that created 
a legacy so that current Black Yalies could win this 
semester. Their energy is here right now—the Craig 
Fosters, the Larry Irvins, the Sylvia Boones, the Glenn 
DeChaberts, my mother and father. The spirit that 
reminds us that, as Assata said best, ‘we have the duty 
to fight for our people and we have the duty to win.’”
A friend of mine once told me that someone called 
the House a “spiritually dead place,” and I think they’re 
halfway right. The last five years of struggle stripped the 
House of its home-like feeling. Sometimes I wonder 
about what came out of our fight for the House. With 
the hiring of Dean Risë Nelson, and with the energy 
brought by the March of Resilience, we are beginning 
to rebuild. 

What is left are ghosts. The House may seem drained, 
but I can feel spirits in every part of the House. The 
founders, past directors, and the undergraduate selves 
of people like Irvin and Williams are all still living in 
this space. Some of them are there to drag us back into 
the worst parts of our collective pasts, preventing us 
from moving forward. Others are there to help us along 
the way.

After a long absence, I happened to walk into the 
House before heading to a meeting. I walked downstairs, where I ran into a friend on the verge of a breakdown, sitting on the stairs and holding back tears. I put 
my meeting off; we talked while she cried. I couldn’t 
make it better, but I could sit with her.

When we walked back to the hallway, she said, almost 
to herself, that I happened to show up right when she 
needed someone. It was like my energy, lingering in 
the space, had summoned me there. 

It was like I was already one of the ghosts.
