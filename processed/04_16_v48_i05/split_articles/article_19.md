A student activist finds her place 
in the history of Black 
organizing at Yale

Micah Jones and I are standing by a foldout table at 
Afro-American Cultural Center, better known as the 
House. She is the president of the Black Student Alli­
ance at Yale, and I am her vice president and right-
hand woman. We’re selling T-shirts to alumni at the 
House’s forty-fifth anniversary event.

A woman, impeccably dressed, approaches us. She 
introduces herself as Bisa Williams. In 1975, six years 
after the House’s founding, Williams became the first 
Black woman president of BSAY since its founding 
in 1967. After Yale, she served as the Ambassador to 
Niger. As she talks to us, she looks over our last-minute 
display. She has an air of officiousness, but there is a 
warmth about her.

She buys a shirt, but before she leaves, she says, “If 
I had to give you any advice, it would be to make sure 
you graduate on time.” She explains that before she 
became president, not a single one of her predecessors 
had graduated within four years. “I was determined for 
that not to be me. I was getting out in four years,” she 
tells us. “People will try to make you do everything, but 
you can’t let them.” 

Micah and I look at each other. Too late. 

For the past two years, I have interacted with the 
House not only as a leader and a member, but also as a 
historian. These roles can’t be separated—black protest 
and black scholarship have long gone hand in hand. 
Black activism at Yale gained global attention this 
past semester through the March of Resilience, when 
students of color reminded the campus of the ways 
in which Yale continues to fail them. And while the 
activism led to important advances, it did not erase past 
conflicts. In my research on the House, I’ve encoun­
tered repetitive cycles of conflict—not only between 
the Black student body and Yale, but also within its 
own community. 

Every BSAY board faces challenges, but the 2014–
2015 board walked into an exceptionally difficult year. 
For four years, the Black community had been frac­
tured under the leadership of Dean Rodney Cohen, 
the House’s top administrator at the time. Within
