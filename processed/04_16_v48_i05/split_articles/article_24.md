want to go work, and live.
MOTHER (getting closer to her daughter): And what 
we do here isn’t working and living? 
YOUNG WOMAN: I need to see the world.
MOTHER: But this is the world, too.
YOUNG WOMAN: Maybe for you.
MOTHER: I need you! How could you do this to 
me? Don’t you love me? Why can’t you be happy here?
YOUNG WOMAN: I need more.
MOTHER: More than your culture, your history? 
Don’t you feel a responsibility to preserve your tradi­
tion?
YOUNG WOMAN: It’s boring, and it makes me sad. 
I’m sorry; this is your fight, not mine.
CHORUS OF CAMPESINAS: The day my family 
member left, I was very sad and I cried a lot. The day 
my family member left, I told her how much I loved 
her, how much I missed her, how much I hoped she’d 
come back. The day my family member left, I asked the 
Virgin of Guadalupe and God to protect her. The day 
my family member left, I worried for her. 
CAMPESINAS exit.
In the audience, Mendieta’s chin quivered. Other 
migrants in the audience wept openly while watching 
the women reenact one of the hardest days of their 
lives. After the play, the women stepped down off the 
stage into their family members’ arms. The families 
were exuberant as they danced, chatted, and drank. 
A local band played popular Mexican cumbia music 
and Coronas flowed out of the open bar. Quite the cast 
party. 

In his cousin’s cramped kitchen, Daniel sits by his 
aunt, Doña Silver, who is staying in Brooklyn with her 
daughter after the tour with CAFAMI. She prepares 
dough for gorditas, thick and saucy tortillas, enjoying 
her remaining weeks with her daughter. She laments 
not being able to use the corn from their family plot 
for the dough—she has to settle for bleached white 
Maseca (dry dough) found in Latino supermarkets 
across the United States. That seems to be the only 
domestic ingredient. She brought chiles and other dry 
vegetables from Mexico to make the orange salsa with 
which she doused the chubby oval gorditas. Her two 
children here in New York will miss her cooking when 
she leaves, since work often prevents them from prepar­
ing time-intensive traditional dishes. But in the three 
months she’s been here, her two children back home 
miss her cooking, too. 

Back at JFK on April 17, the migrant families say 
goodbye to their mothers. Not a single person inter­
viewed in that airport had slept the night before—they 
stayed awake packing, talking, and bracing themselves 
for this moment. The script of “the day my family mem­
ber left” is reversed as sons and daughters watch their 
mothers shuffle through security to catch their flight 
back to Mexico. This time, there are more tears than 
at the reunion in February. Although the CAFAMI 
trips alleviate some of the longing over the course of 
a few surreal and hectic months, the women’s inev­
itable departure for home reopens a wound that has 
yet to scar over. No one knows how long they will go 
without seeing their mothers again. Mendieta hugs his 
son close to his chest as his mother walks away, looking 
over her shoulder, eyes strained. In the Mexico City 
airport, her husband and children eagerly await her 
return. They’ve never been without her for so long, and 
they miss her.
