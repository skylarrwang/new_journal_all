ing to four main categories. First, T-shirts from univer­
sity Hillels. She owns thirty or forty of them. Then, cul­
tural appropriation: shirts that combine imagery from 
other cultures with Jewish themes. “I just was seeing 
so many T-shirts that were including rap references 
and hip hop slogans, and imitating the iconography of 
groups like the Wu-Tang Clan or Lil Wayne,” Grant 
explained. So shirts that say “Jew-Tang” or have images 
of Manischewitz wine with the message “Purple 
Drank” fall into this category. Third: self-aware shirts. 
A shirt in this section, as Grant explains, will “make 
its own utterance of itself” (for example, one red-and-
green shirt reading “Silent Nights Are Boring,” with a 
blue Star of David printed on it, is in this section). The 
connecting threads in this category are more concep­
tual than the others; it is less obvious, from the outside, 
how these shirts are linked.

Fourth and finally: “Did You Get It?” This section 
is comprised of T-shirts that demand inside religious 
knowledge. Grant gives no hints on her label cards. For 
example, a white ringer T-shirt with red-capped sleeves 
asks, “DID YOU…?” with a picture of a bench. To an 
unaware onlooker, the image is a puzzle, but a reli­
gious Jew would know that “benching” is a colloquial 
term for the Birkat Hamazon, an after-meal blessing in 
Orthodox Jewish households. For those who get it, this 
shirt can be a point of connection.

Although this last category focuses on observant 
Jews, Grant is generally more interested in the concept 
(and audience) of non-religious Jews who still engage 
and identify with being culturally Jewish. “If this group 
of people eats a cheeseburger, and eats prosciutto, 
and watches TV on Saturday, and they’re still really 
strongly identifying as Jewish,” she wonders about her 
culturally Jewish peers, “then what exactly defines 
them as Jewish?” Grant wants to spark discussion about 
how, even though some “cultural Jews” break Kosher 
laws (cheeseburgers and pork are not allowed) and 
watch TV on Saturdays (electronics are forbidden on 
Shabbat), they display their Judaism publicly in other 
ways—through certain shirts, for instance, which high­
light humorous aspects of Jewish life that have nothing 
to do with prayers.

The youthful, irreverent nature of “Shmattes” is a 
cornerstone—and perhaps a drawback—of the show. 
When “Shmattes” was displayed at Slifka, Partman 
recalled that, “People that were using [Slifka] for prayer 
were concerned, because some of the shirts had very 
explicit language.” One shirt apparently said the word 
“fuck” on it. There were complaints, and Partman and 
Grant ended up turning the offending shirts against the 
wall. One of Grant’s goals is to look at a distinctly mil­
lennial brand of cultural Judaism, so this controversy 
was only to be expected. She welcomes challenging 
shirts, and in fact is staging a show at Wesleyan this 
week that focuses on controversial or provocative Jew­
ish shirts.

Ari Kelman, a board member of the Shmattes non­
profit and the Jim Joseph Professor of Jewish Studies at 
Stanford, also noticed that many of Grant’s shirts focus 
on contemporary college life since 2010, even though 
Jewish T-shirts are neither a brand new nor a neces­
sarily youthful phenomenon. So he donated some of 
his old Jewish camp T-shirts to Shmattes partly to help 
“expand the story” that Shmattes was telling about Jew­
ish life.

Kelman notes, too, that plenty of adults with no con­
nection to college Hillels engage with cultural Juda­
ism through designing Jewish T-shirts. Their shirts, 
rather than emphasizing rap lyrics or frats, play on 
an inter-generational Jewish humor. Kelman’s friend 
Sarah Lefton, for example, created a shirt printed with 
three birch trees and the words “Yo Semite.” Copy­
ing a Yosemite shirt, this design cuts at a corner of 
culturally Jewish people above the twenty-something 
demographic Shmattes highlights. Stacey Abarbanel, 
another Shmattes board member, also runs a T-shirt 
company called “Jewnion Label” in Los Angeles.

Yale’s own LOX ET VERITAS shirt certainly plays 
to a collegiate crowd, and maybe also to students 
who don’t always project their religion through shirts. 
“Yeah, I think my ‘Lox et Veritas’ shirt is the only Jew­
ish T-shirt I own,” says Partman, laughing. As Kelman 
reflects, Jewish T-shirts “signal in a couple different 
directions to show people that you’re in the group.” 
Wearing a Jewish shirt, whether you’re a college kid or 
a middle-aged professor, signals an insider-ness and an 
access to Jewish life, that can be religious, cultural, or 
somewhere in between.
