**Title: La Casa Rosa: A Transnational Theatre Production**

New York-based playwright, who came to Tetlanohcan 
in 2009. Since then, the women have toured La Casa 
Rosa in America twice, in 2010 and 2012, rehearsing 
for each tour at the Indigenous Migrant Family Sup­
port Center (CAFAMI) in Tetlanohcan. 
Marco Castillo, a cultural anthropologist, worked 
with other academics, young people, and women in the 
community to found CAFAMI in 2007. Castillo arrived 
in Tetlanohcan in 2001 and saw how globalization was 
affecting the town: simultaneously eroding local, indig­
enous lifestyles and leading to large-scale migration to 
the United States. CAFAMI fights those forces. Now 
coordinated by lifelong Tetlanohcan resident Monica 
Lima, CAFAMI offers legal assistance, Nahuatl and 
English language classes, and workshops on human 
rights, specifically those of women and migrants. 
CAFAMI helps people understand (and then work 
around, as with La Casa Rosa) transnational forces 
that affect the town. Since leaving the town for Mex­
ico City, Castillo has reproduced this model to help 
other rural and indigenous communities across Mexico 
harness their creativity and “cultural capital … to find 
holes in the border” and visit loved ones.
La Casa Rosa portrays family separation and migra­
tion from Tlaxcala to the United States. Although peo­
ple have left Tetlanohcan to find work for decades, they 
used to stay in Mexico, moving to nearby cities like 
Puebla or Mexico City. Only in the past two decades 
have people started moving to the United States despite 
American immigration policies that, especially after 
September 11, restricted movement back to Mexico. 
Stories like those of Mendieta and Romero make up 
the backbone of the La Casa Rosa, confronting viewers 
with the issues of remittances, consumer culture, cul­
tural loss, and above all, family separation.
 “Half my heart is there, and half my heart is here,” 
said Doña Gloria Rodriguez, one of the actresses. 
Now, on stages across the Northeast, the women 
essentially play themselves.
After the dramatic reunion at JFK, the women gather 
by the escalator to discuss their trip. Ruth Hernandez, 
a Chicana doctoral candidate at the University of Con­
necticut, organized this year’s tour. She’s been involved 
since she saw the play during CAFAMI’s 2010 trip, 
which led her to write her doctoral dissertation on Tet­
lanohcan. She and Monica, the coordinator in Mexico 
for CAFAMI, hand out sheets at the airport with La 
Casa Rosa’s packed two-week schedule.
After performing the play, the women will stay with 
their children in the United States for two more months. 
They’ll cook with ingredients brought from Mexico in 
their heavy suitcases and care for grandchildren while 
their sons and daughters work. They’ll see that life in 
the U.S. is different from the American Dream that 
lured their children across the border. They’ll real­
ize that as the struggling campesina of Tetlanohcan 
looks wistfully North, the tired migrante looks wistfully 
South—both dreaming of places that don’t quite exist.
CAFAMI’s transnational efforts allow occasional 
family reunions and migrants work to maintain their 
distinct culture, closing the distance between Tetla­
nohcan and New Haven. But there are no clear solu­
tions for the pain of separation, and the families’ time 
together is fleeting. 


As the women of CAFAMI travel the Northeast, 
their neighbors in Tetlanohcan like Daniel Mendieta 
(no relation to David) continue to arrive to the U.S., 
seeking the American Dream. On a Brooklyn bus after 
work, Mendieta slowly peels off the Band-Aid around 
his index finger, wincing. His thick fingers, once accus­
tomed to office jobs, are now covered in burns from 
dishwashing detergent and cuts from kitchen work. It’s 
harder on his hands than the campo, he says, slouching 
back into his seat. He’s been living on a cot in his older 
sister Fabiola’s cramped Brooklyn apartment since he 
arrived in the United States two months ago, working 
in the basement of a Jewish cafe. He spends his days 
off with family in the enclave of Tetlanohcan migrants 
in Brooklyn, and he often takes the train up to New 
Haven to visit his brothers.
Mendieta’s arrival in the United States was unusual. 
Back in Mexico, he had a secure government office job 
in the state capital. He leveraged connections in the 
local government to obtain a visa to study U.S. gover­
nance. Since his arrival, though, Daniel’s experience 
has been typical. When he moved to the U.S., his nine-
to-five became a nine-to-ten, eleven, or even twelve. “I 
come in with the light of the sun, and leave with the 
light of the moon,” he says. “Well, sometimes you can’t 
even see the moon here.” Mexicans, he said, make 
everything in the United States run, like a machine.
When he gets back to the apartment, he absently 
stares at a telenovela on his sister’s gigantic TV, sipping 
a beer between yawns. If all goes according to plan, 
Daniel will bring his pregnant wife, Ana, and tod­
dler-age son, Axel, to the United States.
“It’s really hard to make a life here. Why am I shoul­
dering this?” he wonders. “The only thing that comes to 
mind is my family, the face of my son, and my daughter 
on the way. I have to keep the struggle going.” With the 
money he saves, he will be able to bring his family on 
a plane, instead of on foot like his pioneering siblings 
before him. He’ll go back to Mexico in July to get every­
thing ready, and he will try to move to New Haven with 
them in September. He hopes to save enough money to 
start a restaurant back in Mexico and eventually pursue 
elected office to change policy for the better. He stares 
up at the ceiling and closes his eyes. He has his dreams, 
but everything is uncertain—many Tlaxcaltecas in the 
United States, like Daniel, come with a two-year plan. 

Oscar Romero’s two-year plan is on year twenty-five. 
He came with his older sister, Doña Rosa, to the U.S. 
in 1990 in search of work. They first moved to New 
York City, but they quickly left for New Haven after a 
friend told them that there were more jobs, lower costs, 
and fewer crowds at the other end of a Metro North 
line. Since age 17, Oscar has lived in the Elm City. 
Dona Rosa stayed for ten years, but she returned to 
Tlaxcala in 2000. She missed her parents and 13-year-
old son David, who she would lose again within two 
years when he moved north.
Oscar was one of the first members of New Haven’s 
now-prominent Tlaxcalteca community. He applied 
his skills in flooring and carpeting and built a small 
contracting business, hiring a few Tlaxcalteca employ­
ees. “There’s no work [in Tlaxcala]. The pay is bad 
and there’s lots of competition,” he said, explaining 
his choice to stay. Oscar obtained legal status when he 
married. With that, he could return home a few times 
every year to see family, reconnect with the commu­
nity, and monitor his investments.
But the life he has built here still feels fragile. In 
2008, when the economy crashed, his business tanked 
and he had to lay off his employees. Now, he works 
independently—his latest job is flooring the city’s 
Kensington Square apartments. He works on his knee­
pads in the gutted building, meticulously measuring, 
cutting, and pasting linoleum. “Here you can find a 
job, but you never stop working. The country is nice, 
but there is so much stress. There’s always debts, always 
bills to pay, but one gets used to it. I do like it here,” he 
said, nodding. 
Another of the first generation of migrants from Tet­
lanohcan, Benjamin Cuapio, was a member of New 
Haven’s activist group Unidad Latina en Acción (ULA). 
Like Oscar’s brother Juan, Cuapio fought a labor abuse 
case with the help of ULA director John Jairo Lugo. 
Cuapio snuck a camera into his worksite after he and 
other migrant workers, desperate for employment, had 
been hired to strip asbestos out of a building down­
town without any physical or respiratory protection. 
He documented the deplorable, and illegal, conditions 
and levied charges against his employer. The ensuing 
1997 lawsuit highlighted the plight of undocumented 
Mexican workers in New Haven for the first time. Over 
the next decade, Cuapio continued to fight for migrant 
workers’ rights in New Haven. Due in no small part 
to his work with Lugo and ULA, New Haven became 
a sanctuary city with some of the most pro-immigrant 
policies in the country, encouraging many undocu­
mented migrants to live in the city limits. Cuapio has 
retired from fighting to settle back into his quiet, bare 
concrete house at the top of a hill overlooking the Tlax­
cala valley. Below him, constellations of electric lights 
twinkle from houses. 
Cuapio has remained committed to la lucha, “the 
struggle,” by donating a piece of his land to CAFAMI 
for their community center, which he helps upkeep. 
There, Romero and the others rehearsed and prepared 
herbal products and hand-sewn textiles to present and 
sell to U.S. audiences. They carve out time for La Casa 
Rosa from their constant work in their fields, their busi­
nesses, and their houses. 

The women of CAFAMI traveled through the 
United States with the jovial bounce of tourists on 
vacation—after their New York City performance, they 
shoved onto a train in the Bronx, insisting on visiting 
Times Square. They visited the University of Connecti­
cut, Lehman College, Connecticut College, and New 
Haven’s Bregamos, a Latino community theater in Fair 
Haven built from a repurposed warehouse.
The play, like every Sunday in Tetlanohcan, opens 
with a somber Catholic mass. It moves to an argument 
between two sisters over the virtues and ills of economic 
development in the town, as compared to traditional 
farming lifestyles. Then the chorus of campesinas files 
onto the stage. They work in the fields, hacking with 
wooden machetes at an invisible harvest. Under the 
hot lights of the stage, they wipe real sweat from their 
brows. A condensed version of the play follows: 
A YOUNG WOMAN (turning to her mother): Mom, 
I’m going to the United States.
MOTHER (horrified): The answer is no. You don’t 
have to go. 
YOUNG WOMAN: Mom, please, I do have to go. I

San Francisco 
Tetlanohcan
San Francisco Tetlanohcan is a rural town in the highlands of central Mexico 
in the small state of Tlaxcala, under the dormant volcano La 
Matintzin. New Haven has been the largest destination 
of migrants from the town since the 1990s, and 
they were deemed “sister cities” in 2010. An 
estimated fifteen percent of the town of 
10,000 lives in New Haven.
