**Yale's Divestment Movement**
**Author: Susan Orensuin**
**Page number(s): 22-23**

"There's a certain 
nru.veness among 
people in the CAA 
which may be a 
function of youth and 
social background." 
good but there's also a tendency to 
gloss some of the realities." 
Mikal believes that Yale's policy in 
South Africa is not wholly inconsistent 
with Yale's "less than humanistic" 
p rinciples. The western establishment 
has a tendency to support business 
interests and entrenched elites over the 
democratic interests of people, 
particularly those of color and those 
resorting to violence. He feels that 
people who resist analyzing Yale's 
posture also fail 
to see that the 
University might in fact be living up to 
its principles. People don't want to see 
that the policy is Yale's attempt to 
ensure continued benefits, he says, so

they try to show how divestment would 
create change. But in making its 
policy, the University's primary con-
sideration is how divestment affects 
Yale, not how it affects South Africa. 
If the 
people involved 
in 
the 
movement fail 
to 
sec discrepan-
cies bct~een thP. University's ethical 
positions and its political-economic 
ones, then these students will continue 
to misdirect their energies and to feel 
disillusioned with the movement. 
Anxious to pursue this issue with 
Benno Schmidt and the public, M ikal 
sees himself as one of the more radical 
activists in CAA. H e stakes out a 
position and raises ne.._,. questions, with 
the hope that they will be considered 
later on. For instance. months ago he 
and several others suggested providing 
material aid to black South Africans, 
and only recently did students address 
the subject at meetings. With this time 
lapse in mind. Mikal considers h imself 
more of a political associate than an 
insider in CAA. His sense of com-
munity comes from other sources-
mostly other black graduate students-

though he does respect members of 
CAA and relates to some on a personal 
level. 
While he feels strongly about divest-
ment, he hesitates to become a spokes-
person for CAA, a position he's held 
before. Sitting in his apartment with a 
sleeping child on his lap, he says that 
the limelight is too tempting, too 
empowering. H e doesn't feel rep-
resentative enough to 
reflect the 
majority perspective and believes that 
the preoccupation with spokespersons 
tends to undermine the idea of col-
lective leadership. But he will protest, 
he says. What he calls critical optimism 
lets him believe that "South Africa will 
be a victory soon." For him, then it will 
be on to something else. 
To see Mikal, Amy, Nancy and Steve 
together would give no indication of 
what they have in common. They each 
feel a degree of alienation, whether 
from a predominantly white university 
and white movement, or from their 
fellow students and fellow activists. 
They each recognize that working for 
divestment affects the rest of their 
lives, using up some of Yale's most 
precious commodity- t ime- that 
could be spent on academics,· outside 
interests, and themselves. And finally, 
they are all individuals who have 
committed themselves to something 
broader- to the movement against 
apartheid. While no single individual 
sees himself or herself as representative 
of the entire movement, without such a 
:!rOup of individuals, movements-like 
the Coalition Against Apartheid-do 
not exist.
