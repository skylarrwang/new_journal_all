**An Arts Haven**

Envision a small community of artists 
and art lovers, complete with low 
budget 
housing, 
theaters, 
free-
admission galleries, summer concerts, 
quiet courtyards, retail shops, schools 
for the performance arts, and movie 
houses. For the last twenty years, this 
artistic utopia has been the evolving 
dream of the Arts Council of Greater 
New Haven. Having survived the 
early formative years and a progress-
halting 1970s Pc:onomic recession, the 
Council hopes today to find a prom-
ising home on and around Audubon 
Street. 

The Arts Council, founded in 1968 
by a group of New Haven citizens, 
provides scheduling, publicity, 
funding, and space for its member 
organizations and artists. The council's 
latest victory comes in acquiring the 
old Winery building on Whitney 
Avenue, across from the Foundry and 
the Munson Gallery. The Whitney 
Winery, formerly a popular restaurant 
and bar, now serves as temporary 
headquarters for the newest member 
organization of the Council, a pro-
motion agency called Artspace, Inc. 
"Potentially," says Frances Clark, 
executive director of the Council, 
"Arts pace and the Winery building will 
become an incubator for the Arts." The 
company has as yet only a tentative 
focus, and will not create an agenda 
until its Board of Directors, consisting 
of artists, businessmen, and public 
servants, selects an executive officer in 
late November. Clark adds, "The 
Winery might become a place for local 
artists to experiment in performance, it 
might become a 
small drama 
workshop, it might remain an art 
gallery for local and visiting artists, or 
it might just become all of the above." 

Currently, a group called Artists 
Working in New Haven hosts an 
exhibition of its artwork in the Winery 
building. Artspace allows the group to 
exhibit rent free in exchange for minor 
renovation services. An upcoming 
exhibition, titled "Under $100," will 
sponsor local or visiting visual artists to 
show work, priced at less than $100, 
for only a $5 hanging fee per piece. 

The transformation of the Winery 
building from restaurant to gallery 
marks the latest step towards realizing 
the Arts Council's original dream: an 
artistic invasion of the non-residential, 
Audubon Street district. Among its -
allies, 
the Council counts the 
Neighborhood Music School, 
the 
Educational Center for the Arts, the 
Creative Arts Workshop, and the 
Lincoln Theater building. All of these 
agencies are considered integral parts 
of the evolving plan. "We wanted a 
center which would be a public as well 
as a 
private place," said Charles 
Bower, one of the Council's founders, 
"a place where people could meet, live, 
shop, learn and work in the ambience 
of the Arts: where the presence of art 
as a part of society could be felt and 
enjoyed by the practitioner as well as 
the spectator." 

By the Spring of 1988, a $30 million 
development project cons1stmg of 
office space and residential units on 
Audubon Street 
is 
scheduled for 
completion. This project aims to create 
a supportive community for the local 
theaters, galleries and performance 
houses. With the realization of this 
development project, the Council will 
arrive at the end of a long, successful 
journey. It will have created a strong 
foundation for progressive and popular 
art in New Haven. The next few years 
will tell the beginning of another story: 
can the plan work? The proper 
groundwork now in place, the Council 
and its friends must turn their efforts to 
attracting both artists and art lovers to 
the community they are creating.
