Letters 
To the Editor: 
Alison Cardy's review of Essays That 
Worked (TN], Octo~er 1 7, 1986) was 
so ill-informed and idiotic that it would 
be a waste of time to refute all of it. 
However, there are a few points that 
need correction. 

Miss Cardy begins by criticizing the 
book because it "finally how-to-izes" 
the college application essay, and she 
leads the reader to believe she is an 
authority on the publishing industry. 
In fact, if she had bothered to check, 
Miss Cardy would have found that a 
number of "how-to" books on college 
essays have been published in the last 
few years, in workbook style and with 
such sneaky titles as College Application 
Essays (Arco, 1984) and Writing Your 
College Application Essay (The College 
Board, 1986). Essays That Worked, 
however, takes the completely opposite 
tack of a how-to book -
a fact that is 
obvious to anyone with any knowledge 
of the subject. 

Miss Cardy also criticizes the book's 
bold cover and "crisply professional 
image." Sorry, but bookstores are 
reluctant to sell books that have a "dull 
amateurish image." Would she prefer 
the book to be xeroxed and stapled? 

Basically, Miss Cardy failed to 
realize that Essays That Worked was not 
published for literature seminars at 
Yale. It's meant to assist students 
applying to college. Period. Luckily, 
most high school seniors are brighter 
than she; they know exactly what 
they're buying, and Essays That Worked 
is selling very well (it's #3 on Double-
day's bestseller list) and is getting ex-
cellent write-ups in such media as the 
New York Times, Glamour, and The 
Chronicle of Higher Education." 

Finally, if Miss Cardy had bothered 
to check, she would have learned that I 
am a member of the Class of 1982, not 
1979. 
Sincerely, 
Rollin Riggs, '82

Editors' response: Mr. Riggs seems to have 
misinterpreted the message behind Ms. 
Cardy's review. Nowhere does she suggest 
that she's an "authority on the publishing 
industry, "for obviously, she is only one voice 
presenting one view on Essays That 
Worked. More importantly, however, one 
must recognize Ms. Cardy's salient point: the 
college essay, the one aspect of the application 
process which should allow students to shine 
as individuals- not merely as a compilation 
of test scores and grades- has been reduced to 
yet another part of the "how to apply to 
college" game. 

Finally, 
in calling Ms. 
Cardy's review "ill-informed and idiotic, " 
Mr. Riggs undermines his own credibility.
