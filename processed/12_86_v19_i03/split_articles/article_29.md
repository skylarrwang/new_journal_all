Literature After ''X'' 
I came to Yale graduate school in 1963 
and spent the next 12 years in New 
Haven as a student and member of the 
junior faculty. I left to teach elsewhere 
on a wintry day in December of 1975. 
The snow that stuck to the leaded glass 
windows as I cleared out my office that 
afternoon created a kind of dim quiet, 
and I stopped emptying bookshelves 
for a moment to reflect on the time I 
had spent at Yale. Much had happened 
in the years from 1963 to 197 5: they 
were, indeed, 'the sixties,' a period 
whose meaning sprawled over calen-
dric boundaries into the decade of the 
seventies. 

I had been reminded of this as I 
went through old papers that day and 
discovered a copy of the Yale Dai(y 
News. It was from 1971, but read like a 
catalogue of cliches from the previous 
decade. The top story that day was 
from Kingman Brewster's address to 
the Alumni Association, an item of 
more than usual interest because the 
President had offended many of those 
present by using Alumni Day as an 
occasion to speak out against the Viet 
Nam war; also on the front page was 
an article on the murder trial of Bobby 
Seale, a founder of the Black Panthers, 
which was being held in the New 
Haven court house (with constant 
demonstrations on the Green). On the 
entertainment page 
the Shubert 
Theater advertised a pre-Broadway 
showing of the rock opera Hair, and 
there was a review of a concert given 
by the Yale Symphony Orchestra 
featuring Scriabin's 'Poem of Ecstasy,' 
complete with a light organ that had 
bathed the hall in shifting colored 
strobes and jets of smoke. 

Tucked away on oa~re five, some-
where between news of VietNam and 
reactions to the just-opened Cross 
Campus Library- and just across 
from the newly introduced comic strip 
by an undergraduate named Gary 
Trudeau- was the half-page article 
that had caused me to save that 
particular issue of the Daily News from 
Monday, February 22, 1971. It was an 
article about a new course in Yale 
College called 'Literature X (eks, not 
ten),' and as 
the article's 
title 
('Literature X-World Premiere') made 
clear, it too, in its own way, was a 
review. The piece was there yellowing 
among the papers to be packed 
because, in a modest way, I with 
several others had been involved in the 
planning of Literature X and the series 
of other courses which it was intended 
to initiate. 

Literature X had its origin in a sense 
of crisis in the literary community .. In 
retrospect, there were at least three 
major 
reasons. for 
thinking 
that 
changes in the literary curriculum had 
to be made: the integrity of our 
subject, literature, was being eroded 
by the atomizing claims of different 
national language departments; there 
was a growing conflict in the faculty 
between those concerned with literary 
theory and others who were not; and, 
finally, among students in 1969, when 
planning for the new course began, 
there was an increasing sense that 
literature was 
a 
luxury 
their 
beleaguered generation perhaps could 
not afford- it was not, in the argot of 
the decade, relevant. 

At that time there was no under-
graduate 
offering 
in Comparative 
Literature, and there was widespread 
dissatisfaction with the wav the studv 
of literature was atomized i~to French, 
German, 
English, 
and 
other 
departments. There was a 
history 
department in which the past of all 
these countries could be studied, and a 
philosophy department in which their 
thought could be studied. 
But 
literature was divided along national 
Jines, and the more each department 
refined the concerns of its national 
culture, or sought rigorously to define 
itself as 
profession (Slavistics, 
Germanistik, etc.) the less they seemed 
to have in common with each other. 
The different national adjectives were 
in danger of absorbing the substantive 
they sought to modify. 

And within national language 
departments, 
including of course, 
English, there was further division 
between scholars who pursued literary 
study in traditional ways, and those 
who sought 
to 
engage 
the 
new 
questions about literary methodology 
that began to be raised at the time. It 
was an era of what Thomas Kuhn 
might well have called 'unnatural 
science' 
in 
the history 
of the 
professional study of literature. The 
formerly reigning paradigm, 'New 
Criticism,' had broken down; 
'Structuralism,' which had seemed to 
be its successor in the early sixties, was 
already splintering into the heresies 
collectively labeled 'post-structuralist.' 

Some of these 
heterodoxies first 
emerged in a symposium on the crisis 
in methodology held at Johns Hopkins 
in October, 1966. Two figures who 
were to figure prominently in future 
debates, 
the aging psychoanalyst 
Jacques 
Lacan, 
young 
philosopher nawed Jacques Derrida, 
attracted particular attention. The 
subject of that symposium was 
announced in necessarily plural form 
('The Languages of Criticism and the 
Sciences 
of . Man'), 
plurals that 
reflected the sense many 
in the 
academy then had that their ivory 
tower was becoming a tower of Babel. 

Three years later, in the spring of 
1969, Alvin Kernan, a Shakespeare 
scholar and former Provost, called 
together a group to rethink the future 
of literary study in Yale College. It was 
felt that by bringing together in a 
single course texts from 
different 
national literatures, instructors from 
different literature departments, and 
methodologies 
from 
across the 
spectrum then so richly a,·ailable, we 
might- if not solve- at least more 
openly address problems raised by 
departmental and theoretical schisms. 
By publicly confronting the concerns 
animating us as faculty, it was hoped 
we might persuade students that the 
study of literature had a 
certain 
urgency about it. 

Literature X 
was launched the 
following year, 
and its sense of 
experiment did indeed galvanize 
faculty and students. The desire to 
expand the sense of what might be 
called a text led to excesses which, in 
retrospect, appear very much to have

been 
as trendy as 
the course's 
scandalized- and numerous- cnt1cs 
at the time said they were. Some idea 
of why such charges were brought can 
be gathered from the course's syllabus, 
which included not only Sophocles and 
Dickens, but Joseph Heller's anti-Viet 
Nam War protest play, We Bombed in 
New Haven, which had just opened 
(and had, in fact, rather bombed) in 
New Haven; Eric Segal, fresh from 
helping to script the Beatles' Yellow 
SubtrUJrine, lectured on his new novel, 
Love Story; there were comic book 
heroes, Stover at Yale, and the Story of 9, 
as well as visits to theme parks and 
professional wrestling matches. 

Campus language was briefly enriched 
by a new adjective: if a course in any 
subject seemed slightly unusual or 
modish, it was said not to be 'too sexy,' 
but 'too X-ey.' 

When steps were taken to expand 
into a Yale College 
major, many who had not objected to 
the new course felt they had to resist 
the new program that it was- as its 
enemies said-'spawning.' At each 
stage of the process, opposition grew. 
Reaction ranged from the relatively 
mild official response of the English 
department ("The response of the 
English department to the projected 
Literature · Major is 
difficult 
summarize.") to the less restrained 
petitions against the Major circulated 
by 
individual faculty 
members 
("Disturbing, in any case, is the arid 
scientism and quest for the absolute 
that imbues the concerns of those who 
would [seek to) isolate the central fact 
of 'literature.'"). Finally, at a Yale 
College faculty meeting in the spring 
of 1973, the proposed major was 
approved, but only after a heated 
debate 
that caused some of the 
physicists and 
e ... onomists in 
audience to shake their heads over the 
strange passions animating their 
colleagues in the humanities. 

The program quickly attracted large 
numbers of students; by its third year 
of existence, its 65 majors constituted 
one of the larger humanities majors in 
Yale College. The popularity of the 
program resulted not only from its 
notoriety, which, in any case, was soon 
toned down. More important in the 
major's early 
success were two 
challenging new required courses that 
were soon recognized as among the 
best, 
most rigorous, 
College: Literature Y, a survey of 
literary 
theory 
taught by Peter 
Demetz, and Literature Z, a course in 
close attention to texts that dramatized 
new rhetorical strategies of reading 
taught by Paul de Man and Geoffrey 
Hartmann. Other well known critics 
taught in the major, such as Peter 
Brooks (one of its original framers) and 
J. Hillis Miller, both of whom would 
later become directors of the major. 

The program was being talked about at 
other universities, for the crisis that 
gave it birth was not confined to New 
Haven; there was a small piece in The 
New York Times, and an article in 
College English. 
Request s 
for 
information on what was happening at 
Yale poured in; programs modelled on 
the Literature Major came into being 
places as remote as Murdoch 
University in Perth, Australia. As the 
Major became an institution in the 
college, 
its 
famous 
letters 
were 
translated into numbers: 
Lit. 
X 
became Lit.120, Lit. Y became Lit. 
300, Lit. Z became Lit. 130. In 1979 
the program was enriched by the 
addition of an academically 
de-
manding new track that permitted Yale 
students for the first time to do 
undergraduate work in Comparative 
Literature. 

The phenomenon of the Literature 
Major coincided with a different but 
related phenomenon, 
the growing 
influence of Jacques Derrida (who 
spent part of his time teaching at Yale), 
Paul de Man, Harold Bloom, Geoffrey 
Hartmann, and J . H illis Miller. Each 
of these men had, as an individual 
scholar, played an important role in 
shaping the new direction literary 
study was taking; but during the 
seventies 
they 
became collectively 
known as the Yale School 
of 
Deconstructionists, identified in the 
public mind with the increasing 
tendency (not confined to Yale, but 
most powerfully at work here) to 
breach traditional borders between 
literature, criticism, and philosophy so 
as to forge a new kind of study. 

Demanding as it was, this new way of 
reading became popular. Soon terms 
such as the 'metaphysics of presence,' 
'aporia,' and of course, the verb 'to 
deconstruct,' were being pronounced 
at cocktail parties. Trivialization of 
this kind was far from the complexities 
and rigor of the work de Man and 
others were actually doing. But this 
fame caught at least some of the 
excitement 
students 
exper-
iencing. And since virtually all the 
well-known theorists at Yale were 
associated in one way or another with 
the Literature major, the program took 
on a kind of glamour. It looked as ifthe 
golden age was about to dawn. 

Then in 1983 not just Yale, but the 
international literary community 
suffered a loss when Paul de Man, a 
great teacher and intellectual presence 
as well as theorist, died. In the next few 
years 
Hillis 
Miller and Jacques 
Derrida left to go elsewhere. To the 
world outside Yale, especially that part 
of it familiar with Yale's strength in 
literary studies only through 
phrase-mongering of the popular press 
(or some of the only slightly less banal 
accounts published 
by university 
presses), it appeared that the end had 
come. At some other universities, 
there was not a little relief that Yale's 
hegemony in literary studies seemed to 
have been 
broken. 

When 
I was 
mulling over an offer to return to Yale 
last year, several people at such places 
advised me not to go back to New 
Haven, for, I was told confidently, it 
was a 'wasteland' and the Yale literary 
community was 'devastated.' 

But the truth is that Yale has always 
been fortunate in having great literary 
scholars; there have been other 'Yale 
Schools.' 
New Criticism 
dominated 
studies in the 
fifties, some of its most powerful 
representatives, such as Cleanth 
Brooks and William Wimsatt, were 
Yale professors, and grumbling could
