...be heard in other places in those days. 
too, about 'Yale hegemony.' An event 
that helped pave the way for current 
interest in theory was the publication 
in 1949 of Theory of Literature, co-
authored by Rene Wellek, founder of 
the Comparative Literature Depart· 
ment at Yale. 

The list of great scholars who have 
made Yale synonym.ous with the best 
work being done in literary study could 
easily be extended. But to do so would 
obscure a no less important fact about 
rlw history of literary study at this 
university: such giants always have 
lwcn only the most visible indices of a 
larger community of literary scholars 
that ha\'e learned from their better 
knm' n colleai{UeS, but who have also 
made 
the 
achie,·ement 
of those 
colleagues 
possible. 

The 
most 
remarkable 
thtrlg about 
study 
of 
litt·nuure at Yale has not been the 
number of 'schools' the vniversitv has 
produced from time to time, bu.t the 
consistently high quality of work 
produced at all times by large numbers 
of the senior facultv. The tradition of 
brilfl,tnce. energy, ·capacity for sheer 
hard 
work, 
and 
commitment

leaching among the junior faculty is 
unbroken,

Clare- ~ldlon Fellowship for -.tudy in 
England. 

Tht·re are probkm'>. of course. if 
only becauc;c the Literature l\1ajor has 
been so closely involved over the years 
with literary theory, and literary 
theory itself is presently in a state of 
crisis. The basic structure of the 
Major, except for the addition of the 
Comparative Literature track, has 
gone relatively unchanged since 1973. 
And so a group of scholars is being 
called together to examine the major 
from top to bottom, and a list of 
recommendations will be given to the 
Governing Board that administers it 
next spring. Born in one kind of the 
crisis in the seventies, the Major is 
rethinking itself in the face of another 
crisis as it heads into the nineties. 
What changes will be made cannot at 
this point be known. One thing seems 
certain: at a time when opposing 
versions of literary study are being 
debated with the greatest urgency, the 
M ajor's unique ability to provide a 
space in which ideas can usefully 
contend with each other becomes ever 
more necessary. 

I recently had occasion to look once 
again at that Yale Daily News article I 
unearthed on the dim afternoon in 
December, 1975. It set me once again 
to wondering, this time about : the 
relation of the events that article 
described to the Major as it now exists. 
The student who wrote the article was 
obviously a fan of the major she was 
describing: the account bristles with 
facts, all conveyed with a kind of 
breathless enthusiasm. It is clear in 
retrospect that rr.any of the facts were 
garbled, and the breathlessness is now 
inappropriate 
for 
a 
program as 
mature as the Literature Major has 
become. But there is a faith in the 
future, running throughout that article 
from the past, that has been more than 
j ustified in the present, a useful lesson 
as we once again look to a new future 
for the Major .
