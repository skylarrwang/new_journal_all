flourishes on hundreds of campuses, as 
do others like 
the Marine Pla-
toon Leader Class (PLC) program. 
Local Connecticut recruiters estimate 
that the programs have increased in 
number by 20 percent in the past year. 
And at Yale, more students participate 
in military training programs than 
have in the past ten years. But among 
Yale students the status and repute of 
the armed forces occupy a questionable 
position. 

Only 
18 
Yale undergraduates 
currently participate in officer training 
programs for various branches of the 
military; half of them in the ROTC 
(four in the Air Force and five in the 
Army) and the rest in the Marine 
PLC. In order to pursue their military 
training as undergraduates, 
these 
students must make a number of sacri-
fices throughout the year. Because 
Yale 
hasn't 
sponsored 
a 
ROTC 
program since 1969, ROTC students 
must travel once or twice weekly to 
other Connecticut colleges where the 
programs are sponsored. There they 
participate in classroom training and 
must also 
spend 
one weekend a 
semester in 
the field 
for combat 
training. During the summer after 
their junior year they attend a six-week 
training camp in order to receive a 
commission after graduation. The 
Marine PLC cadets have no commit-
ments whatsoever during the school 
year but attend two six-week or one 
ten-week intensive summer training 
sessions at 
the 
Marine Officer 
Candidate School 
an Quanitco, 
Virginia. Both ROTC and Marine 
students who successfully complete 
their training are offered commissions 
in their branches and, if accepted, they 
become second-lieutenants. None of 
the Yale trainees, however, receive 
academic credit for their training, as 
do trainees at most other coUeges. 
Yale expelled its ROTC program in 
1969, 
partly because of student 
protests and largely because the 
administration felt the program did not 
meet the college's academic sl:mdards. 
The administration and faculty 
decided that no academic credit should 
be given 
for 
the courses, 
that 
instructors should not receive faculty 
status, and that students should not be 
legally obligated to join the service 
after gradu ating. For the last three 


years, however, Yale has maintained a 
policy . of cross-enrollment in the 
ROTC at the University of 
Connecticut and the University of 
Bridgeport for the 
relatively low 
number of interested students. 

Cultural analysts and the media 
have offered 
many reasons why 
military training is on an upswing. 
The most common is the growth of 
patriotism and conservatism in recent 
years. "I've always wanted to join 
because I've always felt an obligation 
and duty of some sort- I guess you 
could call it patriotic," said Matt Jones 
(MC,'89), a sophomore in the Marine 
PLC. Jones completed his first six-
week training session in Quantico this 
summer. He plans to return for the 
second session after his junior year and 
then accept a commission in either the 
Marines or the Navy. 
"I'm very vocal about U.S. foreign 
policy and how the military should be 
deployed," Jones said, "and I have a 
problem with people who take a stand 
and then don't do anything about it." 
Jones considers himself to be a

"staunch conservative" and believes 
that the patriotism displayed in the 
July 4 Statue of Liberty commem-
oration is a sign that public pride in 
U.S. political and military instit\itions 
has resurfaced. "The armed forces 
have always been composed of citizens. 
It's a citizens' army, and it has always 
been a respectable thing to do," J ones 
said. J ones believes the stigmas associ-
ated with the m ilitary came only after 
the backlash of VietNam. "Look how 
long it took to build the Viet Nam War 
Memorial. Now people go there and 
cry, people who didn't even know 
others who served. I think people are 
realizing now that it's wrong to lash out 
at those who did serve~ People realize 
it's a job that has to be done and that 
the people who do it deserve some 
respect." 

Norman Dy (SM, '87), a senior who 
has spent all four years at Yale enrolled 
in the Army ROT C, said that al-
though his primary motivation for 
joining ROTC was 
to 
satisfy a 
personal patriotic obligation, financial 
considerations played a large role in his 
decision. While the Marines offer 
cadets a salary of $200 a week during 
summer training, 
ROTC offers 
substantial academic scholarships. Dy 
and the eight other Yale R OTC 
students, 
are 
on 
full 
academic 
scholarships which 
pay for their 
tuition, books, and other expenses 
incurred during the year. ROTC also 
pays for the cost of driving to the 
University of Bridgeport, 30 m inutes 
away by car, where Dy and four other 
officer trainees attend classroom 
training two times a week. Although 
Army ROTC students are not re-
quired to serve in the military for their 
first two years of their undergraduate 
training, those who participate in 
ROTC during their last two years are 
asked to sign a contract binding them 
to three or four years of service after 
graduation. Any student who accepts a 
scholarship from ROTC also agrees to 
serve after graduation. 

According to Dy, most of the public 
sees mandatory service in return for 
financial 
aid as 
frightening 


commitment. "The idea isn't 'Oh my 
God, we're going to have to spend four 
years in the Army'. A lot of people 
think it's like going to prison," said Dy. 
"It's not like going to prison at all. 
You're just defending your country for 
four years and you're getting paid for 
it." Without the scholarship, Dy would 
not have been able to afford paying the 
Yale tuition. He plans to delay his 
entry into active duty in order to 
attend medical school, which the Army 
will also fmance in return for a longer 
time commitment. Dy compared his 
decision to enter the ROTC with that 
of a friend whose four years at MIT is 
being financed by a chemical company 
in return for his commitment to spend 
three years in their employment. 
"When you're in the ROTC," Dy said, 
"you're essentially working 
company." 

But many students across the 
country who participate in some form 
of ROTC do not have ttcademic 
scholarships of anv kind According to 
Scott Bowen (CC, '90), one of Yale's 
four Air Force RUTC students, most 
participants go through ROTC of their 
own volition, simply because they 
desire a career in the military. Bowen 
travels an hour and a half each 
Thursday for classes at the University 
of Connecticut at Storrs, where only 
ten of approximately 200 Air Force 
trainees are on scholarship. "Most of 
those 
people are 
not getting 
money," Bowen said. "That means 
these are people whv look forward to 
and depend on a commission after they 
graduate. To receive the pay and life of 
an officer in the Air Force means a lot 
to them. It's their career. It's what they 
want." 

Bowen, a freshman whose father is a 
doctor in the Navy, came from a 
military home. He said that he has 
never been "gung-ho military" and that 
obtaining financial aid was the biggest 
factor in his decision to go ROTC. 
Because Bowen is a freshman in his 
first year of ROTC, he is under no 
obligation to continue the program 
and has his first year as a grace period 
to examine the program. After that, 
The low visibility and misunderstanding of military trainees at Yale frustrates 
Maureen Ortiz (SY ,'89). 

because he is on a full engineering 
scholarship, he will be committed to 
finish the program and enter the 
service. Although confident that he will 
complete the program, Bowen is skep-
tical about the military as a career. But 
he thinks of his committment to 
ROTC as a fair trade-"l'm not just 
taking the money and running. They 
give to me and I'll give back." 

Aside from these practical financial 
advantages, 
much of the current 
appeal of the armed forces Sl'!ms from 
a renewed respect for the military, a 
sense of the military as a time-honored 
and character-developing endeavor. 
Ron Vanden Dorpel, the Director of 
Corporate and Foundation Relations 
for Yale, is the University's advisor to 
Yale students who are interested in the 
ROTC and other related military 
training programs. A former Air Force 
intelligence officer and a major in the 
Air Force Reserve, Vanden Dorpel put 
himself through school on a full Air 
Force scholarship when he was in 
college. 

Vanden Dorpel sees the military 
taking on a "respectability" it once had 
in years past at Yale. "Woolsey Hall, 
after all, is a war memorial and it 
stands at the very center of campus," 
Vanden Dorpel said. "Yale has always 
been an institution that engendered the 
military." He recalled the mili-
tanzauon of Yale's campus during 
World War II and the consequent 
separation between American 
educational institutions and the 
military which followed that war and 
Viet Nam. "There was a time when 
joining the military was considered 
part of a general education. It was 
something that refined you, and it was 
very natural for people who came to 
Yale to do this. It was more than 
patriotism. It simply made you a well-
rounded person- it was the traditional 
thing to do," Vanden Dorpel said. 

The old sensibilities which Vanden 
Dorpel describes, of the military as a 
necessary and honorable part of a 
"Yale man's" education, appear to be 
resurfacing again. Once seen as an 
opportunity to gain the discipline 
needed for life after the "wild college 
years," the order and regimentation of 
the military have become a desirable 
"rite of passage" in the minds of some 
Yale students. This aspect of the 
military is especially important for 
many of the Marine PLC cadets who 
undergo grueling tests of mental and 
physical 
training at the 
Officer 
Candidate School in Quantico. Ac-
cording to PLC cadets, time spent at 
Quantico is difficult and stressful. 
Nonetheless, the Marine discipline and
