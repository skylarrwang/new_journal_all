"There was a time 
when joining the 
military was 
considered part of a 
general education . 
It was more than 
patriotism. It simply 
made you a well-
rounded person." 
A craftsman's hands place a slab of 
crude steel into the coals of a fiery 
bellows. The slab begins to take shape, 
as 
it 
is 
pounded, 
molded, 
and 
straightened, then immersed in water, 
removed and polished. Finally, etched 
and adorned, the sword is placed in the 
hands of a U.S. Marine who wields it 
proudly. That image, the slow dream-
like transformation of crude metal into 
a decorated emblem of prestige and 
power flashes daily across America's 
television 
screens. 
Though 
a 
commercial advertisement, 
is a 
metaphor, 
sense, 
of the 
transformation of young civilian men 
into members of America's fighting 
elite. But it signifies something greater 
-a change 
in America's cultural 
attitudes towards the armed forces. 
A rene.wed interest in the m ilitary is 
visible 
all 
facets of American 
culture. In college magazines like Dorm 
and Newsweek's On Campus, military 
advertising is heavy, selling slick and 
adventurous images of military life, 
and films like Rambo and Top Gun draw 
the largest crowds. The military has 
taken on a prominence not seen for 
two decades. 
All branches of the 
military are reaching out to college 
students, many of whom are too young 
to recall the effects of the Viet Nam 
war. Some see the military not only as 
a respectable endeavor for students just 
leaving college, but as an honorable 
and prestigious endeavor as well.
