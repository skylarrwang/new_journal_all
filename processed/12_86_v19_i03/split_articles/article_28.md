Viotti da Costa conceived of the idea to 
teach 
the course after a 
faculty 
meeting. "[At the meeting] someone 
said that we were losing sight of what a 
College of Arts and Science was. He 
said we were giving an excessive 
professional orientation to our students 
and that we should be more concerned 
with 
g1vmg students a 
humanist 
education and helping to form good 
citizens." 

Viotti da Costa thought about what 
it meant to be a "good citizen" and 
decided a good citizen was someone 
with "critical skills," someone "who can 
think on his or her own." As a teacher 
she felt she had a clear role in helping 
her students to become good citizens. 
•Education is not mere communication 
of information. For that people can go 
to the library," she said. "Education is 
also teaching people how to think. I 
should be able to help students develop 
some of the skills necessary to the 
understanding of history." Viotti da 
Costa also considers student 
involvement crucial to the learning 
process. "A lecture, no matter ~ow 
interesting it is, will probably be 
forgotten in a few years," she said. 
"What you never forget is what you 
thought out yourself, the questions you 
were led to ask and tried to answer on 
your own." Viotti da Costa sums up 
her philosophy of education: "As 
someone once said, a student is not a 
vase to be filled but a lamp to be 
lighted. I believe that."
