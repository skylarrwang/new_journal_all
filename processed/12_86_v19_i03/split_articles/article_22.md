curriculum, but would treat it as any 
other extra-curricular activity. Because 
the administration still upholds its 
policy that there should be no faculty 
status for instructors, no academic 
credit for the training, and no 
contractual obligatio.n to serve after 
graduation, ROTC will most likely 
never return to Yale as a part of the 
curriculum. Vanden Dorpel also said 
that because Yale recently adopted a 
policy that disallows discrimination on 
the 
basis of sexual 
orientation, 
difficulties between Yale and the 
military would arise because the 
m ilitary is constrained by feder~1 law 
from admitting homosexuals into the 
service. 

Although ROTC could not return as 
an official institution, it could return as 
an extra-curricular activity for Yale 
students to pursue on their own. "It's 
not a question of people at Yale not 
wanting it back," said Dy, who believes 
that student attitudes towards the 
ROTC have changed from scorn to 
ignorance. "It's a question of the Army 
not wanting the ROTC here. It all has 
to do with numbers, and the numbers 
interested in ROTC at Yale are not yet 
worth the ffirmy's time."
