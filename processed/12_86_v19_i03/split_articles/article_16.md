whites in the group. The second reason 
involves a feeling Steve has himself. 
Because people with his background do 
not traditionally come to Yale, he feels 
he had to work hard to get here and his 
family had to work hard to put him 
·here. Coming mainly for an education, 
he feels a pull- an obligation even- to 
focus on academics and activities 
promoted by the University. H e feels 
this pull may also exist for non-white 
students, and he senses that many are 
apolitical. 

D espite his own background, Steve 
says he has formed an ideology that 
pushes him towards activism. "I'm not 
saying Yale divesting is going to get rid 
of apartheid, but how can I sit here on 
my butt and do nothing?" he says with 
emphasis, hitting his leg. "I think there 
are times that you have to leave debate 
behind and do something." And he 
does. Steve sees his value to CAA in 
terms of committment and time, and 
he works on projects such as 
organizing a recent discussion for 
freshpeople. Sometimes sensing. that 
his efforts may not bring a return in 
the form of divestment, he wonders 
whether his work does any good.:··But 
the answer really does not matter. "I 
think about the images, the people 
affected by apartheid, read some of the 
literature around the shanties . . . I 
know I can't change a system myself, 
but obviously doing nothing will do 
nothing." 

Though he expends much energy 
fighting Yale policy, Steve resists 
feeling completely alienated from the 
University. "What I feel alienated from 
are the types of people who fall head 
over heels for the whole place and say, 
'Look at tradition - tt's fantasttc; who 
don't think a little more about who they 
are and what's happening here. There's 
an incredible amount of insensitivity in 
the administration." Still, experiencing 
college remains important to him, 
tradition and all. He goes to Mory's, to 
Wbiffenpoof concet:ts and football 
games. "When I look back at Yale, I 
think I will feel they were very good 
years," he says. "There's still a lot of 
Boola Boola left." 

Steve Mar,chese's working-class back-
ground d etermines his perspective on 
stude~t activism . 

Like most students, Nancy Fishman, 
DC 
'88, 
came 
to 
Yale for 
the 
opportunities it offered her, 
academically, socially and extracur-
ricularly. Turning over much of her 
time to CAA meant, in effect, that she 
could not engage in her own life the 
same way. And her orientation at Yale 
changed substantially. Late last spring, 
for exampte, Nancy went to a Yale 
symphony concert in Woolsey Hall. 
Sitting down as the music began, 
she looked at the rows of faces 
surrounding her. After a few minutes, 
she realized that for the first time in 
months she was in a crowd that wasn't 
chanting. A white student from New 
York City, Nancy jokes about the 
frustrations of being a middle-class 
radical. At one time, she says, she 
really was a knee-jerk liberal who 
didn't take · the time to learn specific 
issues and act. But today she claims 
·her involvement is deeper. "You can't 
stay 
with 
it very 
long and 
be 
committed if you're knee-jerk. That's 
probably why the number involved 
fluctuates a lot." 

Nancy literally wears irony on her 
sleeve. A red arm band is tied above 
her elbow, bunching the material of a 
thick Yale sweatshirt. The image 
suggests other combinations, other 
parts to balance-student life and 
activist life, allegiance and protest,
