Costa. All previous history courses she 
had ever taken were "mere recitations 
of what was in the text book . . . , 
which required memorization rather 
than understanding. I took a great 
dislike to that kind of history and that 
kind of teaching." 

At the University of Sao Paulo, 
Viotti da Costa chose 
to study 
anthropology, ethnography and an 
Indian language (Tupi) as part of her 
hi!!tory major. She graduated from the 
University with a fellowship from the 
French government to study at the 
Sorbonne's Ecole Pratique des Hautes 
Etudes. By that time she also had a 
baby daughter whom her mother took 
care of while Viotti da Costa studied. 

Viotti da Costa spent one-and-a-half 
years in Paris and fell in love with the 
city. "History was everywhere in the 
streets of Paris," she said. "There was 
an extraordinary atmosphere of 
intellectual activity. Maybe it was all 
imagination, nothing but a 
myth 
cultivated by intellectuals and artists, 
but I swear I could feel it in the air." 

During her time abroad, Viotti da 
Costa 
travelled 
all 
over Europe. 
"Travelling was more instructive than 
many years at the University had 
been. Visiting places and going to 
museums can teach you more about 
history than hundreds of books." She 
added, "But this is probably true only 
after you have read the books and 
heard the lectures." 

When her fellowship ended, she 
returned 
to 
Brazil 
write 
her 
dissertation on the French nobility 
after the Restoration. "I realized that I 
could hardly have a serious career if I 
became a specialist in French history," 
she said. "Our library was poor, the 
University had no money to send 
people abroad. It would have been 
very difficult then to go to Europe as 
often as I needed to keep up with that 
field." She did not consider moving to 
France either. "I was too much of a 
Brazilian," she said. "I missed the 
colors of Brazil while I was in Paris, 
the colors of the earth, of the strong, 
blue sky, the green in winter." Viotti 
da Costa dec.ided the only field she 
could do any serious work in was 
Brazilian history. Focusing on her own 
country, she began a dissertation on 
the transition from slavery to free labor 
in the coffee sector. For about ten 
years, 
she 
researched 
and 
wrote 
numerous essays 
for 
publication. 
During this time she also had two more 
children and was divorced. In 1964, 
her one thousand-page dissertation 
became a book which made her famous 
among academics in Brazil, Europe 
and the United States. 

"When I started writing my book in 
the early sixties,"said Viotti da Costa, 
"Brazilian society was undergoing a 
period of profound political changes." 

Viotti da Costa had spent most of her 
childhood under a dictatorship. "At 
that 
time," she said, 
"fascist, 
corporatist institutions were very much 
in vogue in Brazil." The dictatorship, 
she said, left behind "a legacy of a 
populist political style and mass 
mobilization never seen before in 
Brazilian history." During this time 
Brazil was also undergoing enormous 
industrial changes, and Viotti da Costa 
watched 
Sao 
Paulo's 
population 
explode. (When she was a child, the 
population of the entire municipal area 
totalled about 1.5 million. Today the 
population is about 18 million people.) 

"Styles of living and political styles all 
changed before 
my 
eyes," 
said. "One thing, however, did not 
seem to change: the poverty of the 
people." Slums sprouted in Sao Paulo 
faster 
than 
middle-class 
neighborhoods. "In Brazil," said Viotti 
da Costa, "you cannot avoid seeing 
classes. Social inequality is apparent to 
anyone who lives there. Many times 
people would ring your bell to ask for 
money or food. The contrast between 
rich and poor was overwhelming." 

Viotti da Costa travelled throughout 
Brazil and saw the same contrasts 
between rich and poor on a national 
level. "I could see the oppression and 
ignorance of the people, but I could 
also appreciate their strength and their 
marvellous capacity for survival. I felt 
always very do9e to them: she said. Vl()(ti da 
Costa, like many others, became 
convinced there was something wrong 
with a 
country 
so abundant in 
resources, yet so unable to help its 
poor. 

In the early 60s, a new government 
came into power and Viotti da Costa 
began to notice a fascinating parallel 
between her dissertation on slavery 
and oppression a hundred years ago 
and the reality of her day.. "Like 
nineteenth century conservatives who 
opposed slave emancipation and 
accused the abolitionists of being 
communists, the conservatives of the 
1960s opposed agrarian reform in the 
same way," she said. "The words of the 
past seemed to be echoing in the 
present." The political situation in 
Brazil grew more and more turbulent 
with strikes, student demonstrations 
and rallies. In 1964, the same year 
Viotti da Costa published her 
dissertation, the country was silenced 
when a military coup overthrew the 
government and remained in power 
for almost twenty years. 

During the pre-military years, the 
University had been a politically active 
force. But after the coup, the military 
persecuted students and teachers who 
opposed the regime and forced several 
famous teachers to retire. 

The 
situation worsened when 
in 1968 
several students were arres~ed and on; 
was killed, sparking major student 
demonstrations throughout the 
country. 

Another military 
coup 
brought a more repressive, violent 
regime into power and more people 
were 
forced 
retire from 
the 
University. "I was among about one 
hundred of those forced to retire from 
the University of Sao Paulo in 1969,'' 
said Viotti da Costa. "That meant my 
career was over. At least for the 
moment." 

After her retirement, Tulane 
University invited Viotti da Costa in 
1970 to be a visiting lecturer. She went 
to Tulane having never spoken English 
except during a visit to England many 
years earlier. "' had to write all my 
lectures," said Viotti da Costa, "but my 
students were patient and kind." They 
threw her a party when she left and 


Viotti da Costa went back to Brazil 
with many warm feelings for the 
University and New Orleans. But the 
Brazil to which she returned was even 
more brutal than the one she had left. 
"This was not the world I had been 
brought up in," said Viotti da Costa. 
"It was a new and harsher world, a 
world of stupidity and cruelty, of 
dogmatism and chauvinism, a world 
of careensm and 
opportunism, 
everything I had learned to abhor." 

She was soon invited once again to 
teach in the United States. this time b)' 
the University of Illinois and then by 
Smith College. "My English was im-
proving," said Viotu da Costa, "but I 
still had great difficultv in expressing 
myself. 
Speakin~ in someone else's 
language is a 
very crippling ex-
perience. You fecl'ike a blind person . 
.\-loving from one countrv to another is 
not only learning anothe.r language, it 
is also 
learnin~t tlw proto< ol... the 
signs and codes ol another culture 
That is not an eas\ task K 1\:evertheless, 
some 
Smith 
students 
asked 
University president to im ite her back 
and three of her students went on to 
graduate school in history. "I felt 
rewarded," said Viotti da Costa. "It is 
exciting to see a mind developing. It is 
moving to see someone becoming 
intellectually 
motivated, developing 
criticaJ skills, learning." 

Yale offered Viotti da Costa a 
pos1t10n 
in 
1973, 
where she has 
remained since then, even though her 
children have moved back to Brazil 
and the Brazilian government, in 
1979, invited her to return to her 
former position at the UniversitY of 
Sao Paulo. "Sometimes I think I made 
the wrong decision," she said. In the 
United States, Viotti da Costa feels she 
has experienced sexual discrimination 
on an academic level, something she 
felt she had not experienced in Brazil. 
"In Brazil I never felt for a minute that 
my colleagues discriminated against 
my being a woman intellectual," said 
Viotti da Costa. "The only time I ever 
felt discrimination of that kind was 
when I got to the United States. In 
Brazil, however, there was a form of 
discrimination which I didn't find 
here- the 
discrimination of one's 
husband. While in the United States,
