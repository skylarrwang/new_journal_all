"The Yale Shuttle 
dropped me off in 
front of my apartment 
and drove off, leaving 
me alone to fiddle 
with my keys." 
The threat of crime constantly forces 
people to choose between their safety 
and their sense of independence. One 
woman living on Lynwood remarked , 
"It's affected my sense of mobility, to 
be able to come and go as I please." 
Said Betsey, who lives two blocks from 
campus, "It's frustrating, because I 
think of myself as independent." Yet 
many women still walk home alone. 
"Sometimes I walk home alone late at 
night," said a woman who lives on 
Dwight. "I'm completely scared. I'll 
always ask one of my friends to walk 
me home, but they still don't seem 
aware of how dangerous it is. I'll ask, 
but I don't want to be seen as pushy. 
And I don't want to be weak and 
fearful." 

While most students agree that the 
threat of crime has personally affected 
them, only one group has addressed 
the problem with direct action: the 
residents of Lynwood Place, who have 
just been certified as New Haven's 
Block Watch #252. Students working 
with police officers organized the block 
watch in October and November. 
Lynwood had a block watch about five 
years ago, but the transient nature of 
the 
neighborhood hastened its 
disintegration. This time, however, 
determined students want to make it 
last. A block watch can counter the 
fragmentation that usually develops in 
a neighborhood whose residents change 
yearly. "As we formed the block watch, 
we realized we d idn't even know each 
other," 
said 
Catherine, 
a 
watch 
participant. 

Thirteen people attended the third 
block watch organizational meeting on 
November 10, representatives from 
many of the houses on Lynwood. A 
man and a woman from the New 
Haven Police conducted the meeting. 
As it began, a car alarm went off 
outside the house. People laughed 
nervously and looked at each other, 
but no one moved. "It goes off all the 
time," said someone, and everyone 
relaxed. Six burglaries had occurred 
after their first m eeting in September, 
and three more since the second. The 
group would become official soon after 
this third meeting. 

T he 
Police Departm ent's 
rep-
resentative focused on the main tool 
of the block watch , the phone chain, 
for which telephone lists are distrib-
uted to each house involved. The lists 
contain ever y one's 
names 
in 
geographical order. The phone chain 
requires participants to phone the 
police when 
they 
see 
a nything 
suspicious and then to phone the next 
person on the list. In this way, 
residents can safely keep track of a 
suspect as he m oves down the street 
and provide the police with additional 
information. An effective phone chain 
requires people to know each other 
well enough to call their neighbors 
without hesitation. Having a whole 
group involved not only increases the 
chance of otlserving potentially 
dangerous activity, but also decreases 
any stigma attached to one person 
constantly calling 
the· police, and 
diminishes the fear of being singled out 
for retribution by the criminals. 

After the meeting, the police officers 
talked about the problems involved in 
setting up a block watch in a student 
neighborhood . "The main problem is 
the high turnover rate- as people 
graduate, it takes a yearly effort to 
keep people involved," an officer said. 
"To keep people 
involved, we'd 
appreciate Yale's help in getting us in 
touch with students." On Dwight, in 
spite of widespread interest, a block 
watch never got off the ground. "We 
talked about a block watch, but it 
hasn't materialized, due to students 
being involved in so many other 
things," explained Larry. At this point, 
Lynwood remains the only street that 
has organized a block watch. 

Although students are clearly 
interested in taking responsibility for 
their own security, the extent of Yale's 
responsibility remains unclear. As Yale 
students it's clear that they have a right 
to expect some attention from the 
University. Many choose to move off 
campus to get away from poor on-
campus living conditions.

survey mentioned over-crowding as 
the main reason why they moved off. 
But the Yale administration has not 
addressed any of these issues, let alone 
done something to prevent off-campus 
crime or to educate st~dents about the 
dangers of moving out of the colleges. 
The Security. Committee has met 
twice this semester but has not once 
raised the crime issue. H eaded by 
University Secretary John Wilkinson, 
this Committee includes representa-
tives from the Yale Police, directors of 
various administrative deparfments, 
representatives from the residential 
colleges as well as two graduate 
students and two undergraduates. "It 
has not been a subject of discussion on 
Security 
Committee," 
Wilkinson. But he admitted, "We do 
have an obligation to do all we can to 
help those living near campus, to 
ensure that they can walk safely to 
campus." Currently the Yale Police 
patrols streets on which Yale owns 
buildings, such as Lake Place and Park 
Street. Neither the Administration nor 
the Police, however, seems to have a 
clear off-campus policy, which states 
where their responsibility begins and 
ends. "It's definitely a grey area," said 
Cary Davis, an undergraduate who 
has served on the committee for two 
years. 

The problem 
with determining 
where the Yale Police's responsiblity 
ends further complicates the issue of 
who should be protecting Yale's off-
campus students. Technically the Yale 
Police is not responsible for the 
Lynwood area. Students report crimes 
in the neighborhood to the New H aven 
police. At the same time, the Yale 
P olice, whose receivers pick up New 
H aven Police transmissions, often 
respond to New Haven Police calls in 
the Yale area. Patrolling, however, 
seems to be New Haven's respon-
sibility. Last year, a Yale Police car was 
often stationed near the parking lot 
behind Davenport on Elm street, 
providing a visible deterrent to street 
crime in the neighborhood. Students 
refer to the absence of the police car as 
an 
illustration of the lack of 
involvement on the part of the Yale 
police. So far, however, the possibility 
of a review of Yale's policy has not been 
discussed. 

The Yale administration and the 
Yale Police could pursue a number of 
different policies in an attempt to 
counter the increasing threat of crime. 
They could increase the presence of the 
Yale Police in the area. Although 
available 
manpower, 
as 
well 
budgetary constraints probably 
prohibit a sustained increase, a strong 
presence in September and October 
would go a long way towards cutting 
crime in the area. Not only are 
students highly visible as they move in, 
but they are unacquainted with the 
area. The warm weather in these 
months forces people to sleep with their 
windows open, and also makes it easier 
for criminals to stay on the streets 
longer. December and January, not 
coincidentally, 
are statistically 
months of lowest crime.
