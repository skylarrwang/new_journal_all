Hermann Broch in Saybrook courtyard. 
The courtyard 
fa~ades of Saybrook 
College are like gravestones. Names of 
the important and wealthy of Yale's 
past have dug their way into the waps, 
along with honorary epithets such as, 
"prodigal in labors for public good, 
guide to all things fine." Not that I 
expected to find H ermann Brach's 
name carved ornately into stone, but I 
did hope that the Saybrook library 
would contain some record of his time 
at the college. Up in the library I 
flipped through a scrapbook from 
1949, those happy days when every 
third person answered to "Zeke" or 
"Ros" or "Grant," also the year that 
Brach was a Savbrook associate fellow. 
T here were tw~ pages on the fellows, 
but Broch did not appear among them. 
The last picture to catch my eye 
showed a man wearing a bra, and 
below it someone had written: "Trying 
to outdo Jane Russell, Don?" 
Scene change: the white walls of the 
Beineckt> Rare Book and Manuscript 
Library. Cool and austere- no one 
would ever carve names into these 
walls - their smooth marble panels 
provide a fitting background to the 
quiet and purposeful manner of K rista 
Salmons, curator of German 
literature. She leads me towards her 
office, farther into Beinecke than I 
really care to go, where a bust of Broch 
sits on a shelf. He has serious, deep 
brows and is looking towards the floor. 
Salmons opens up a black cardboard 
box and inside lies a thick slab of 
typescript, corrections scribbled here 
and there on its many pages; this is the 
working copy of The Death of Virgil, 
Brach's greatest novel. Salmons is 
smiling. 
Broch spent the last years of his life 
at Yale, but left little mark here outside 
of his few personal friendships and the 
immense Broch archive at Beinecke. 
Because it contains his one hundredth 
birthday, 
however, 
this year has 
brought him special attention. 
Academicians 
like 
to celebrate 
birthdays with scholarly conferences, 
and the two most notable Broch 
centennial celebrations took place in

Yale. Those

with related memorial events, hope to 
increase Broch's audience; not an 
enviable task, for Broch is virtually 
unknown outside of the literary and 
academic circles which consider him 
one of the greatest authors of this 
century. 
Hermann Broch-born Vienna 1886, 
died New Haven 1951-wrote really 
long sentences. Some of them are 
burdensome, some are lyrical, and at 
least one is just plain 12 pages long. 
Twelve 
pages. 
Broch's English 
translator, Jean Starr Untermeyer, 
along with a few scholars who paid her 
an extended visit, spent a 
week 
unravelling this particular sentence. 
The complexity of Broch's 
prose 
divides opinion on him, and perhaps 
constitutes one obstacle to his gaining a 
wider readership. Broch is difficult 
going. At his worst he is ponderous, 
overstated, self-indulgent, and 
irritating. Herman Weigand, whose 
early essay "Broch's Dtath of Virgil: 
Program 
Notes" provided the 
metaphor of the book as a symphony, a 
metaphor which to this day occurs 
in almost any discussion of the book, 
referred to The Death of Virgil as a 
"monstrous phenomenon of a book." 
And Weigand liked the novel. 
But when Broch is good, the length 
of his sentences becomes a marvelous 
attribute, endowing them with a 
unique poetic rhythm. His prose style 
and thematic material betray the 
influence of an academic training in 
philosophy and place him firmly within 
the German literary tradition. But 
flashes of a dry wit sneak through,

often working subtly but sometimes 
creating an outright funny moment. 
Early on in The Sleepwalkers, Broch's 
other major novel, the main character, 
a stiff upright man belonging to the old 
Imperial German society, rides in a 
droshky with a dark gypsy-like woman 
named Ruzena. Broch relates: 
But when, as in a dark cave, they sat in tne 
droshky under !he covered roof with the rain 
flaps lei down, the fain! sofl drumming of the 
raindrops on 1he s1re1ched leather above 
them, seeing nothing of the world save the 
coachmen's cape and two grey strips of 
roadway through the opening on either side, 
and soon not even seeing that, then their 
faces bowed cowards each ocher, met, and 
melted together, dreaming and flowing like 
the river, lost irrevocably, and ever found 
again, and again sunk timelessly. It was a 
kiss !hat lasted for an hour and fourteen 
minutes. 
Broch's style changes tremendously 
depending on his purposes. As one 
progresses through The Sleepwalkers the 
sentences get shorter, less romantic, 
more philosophical. As does Joyce in 
Ulysses, Broch plays with different 
forms of narrative: he writes one 
section in dramatic form, and a 
number as poetry. Yet it is in the long, 
lyrical sentences of The Death of Virgil, 
however, that Broch's style becomes 
most uniquely his own. 
Though Broch has in the past, 
especially in 
the United States, 
belonged 
mostly 
to the academic 
world, recently public interest in his 
work has increased. The Sleepwalkers 
and The Death of Virgil have come out in 
new 
paperback editions, 
and his 
Bergroman has recently been translatt:d 
under the title The Spell. A major 
biography by Paul Michael Luetzeler 
appeared in German last year, and a 
new edition of Ernestine Schlant's 
biography/study of Broch in English is 
about to be released. A number of 
popular and influential contemporary 
literary figures, such as Susan Sontag 
and Milan Kundera, have mentioned 
Broch either as one of their favorite 
authors or as a majo. influence on their 
own work. 
In spite of this subtle increase in 
public recognition of Broch's work, 
however, the academic world can still 
safely claim him for its own. The Yale 
centennial conference brought together 
scholars from all over Europe and the 
United States. Entiâ€¢ced "Literature, 
Philosophy, Politics, and the Mind of 
Hermann Broch," it began on 
November 20 and continued through 
November 22. 
Three speakers presented papers in 
each session of the conference, and 
every paper received a reply. Though 
German was the native language of the 
majority of the audience, most of the 
talks were given in English. When the 
discussion got interesting the reply 
period generated a heated exchange, 
and when it got really interesting the 
speakers strayed far from the original 
topic, often lapsing into German. Thus 
one session began with a paper on 
children in Broch's work, inspiring a 
discussion which took on religious 
overtones when the children were 
placed in the role of redeemers. Then 
the discussion became psychoanalytic, 
both of Broch and of his characters, 
eventually raising the question of 
whether this work of Broch's should be 
regarded from the literary standpoint 
at all, or perhaps, because the work 
was never finished, of whether the 
political circumstances and societal 
influences were most important, and 
then finally the themes met, melted 
together, and it was time for the coffee 
break. The talk may well have lasted 
for an hour and 14 minutes.
