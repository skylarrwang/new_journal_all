'85), TRADES has grown from a 
Dwight Hall summer jobs program 
with an $8000 budget into an 
independent, quarter-million dollar 
company that trains local high school 
dropouts to paint. It employs them 
year-round while providing some 
classroom education in the evenings. 
Rich sees New Haven as a city with 
both a great demand for painters and 
high unemployment. TRADES, he 
says, seeks to reduce that mismatch. 
Although TRADES has survived 
hand-to-mouth since its creation, . its 
prospects for the future look good. "It's 
still touch-and-go financially, but }Ve 
now have a solid community-based 
organization," Rich said. 


Though Rich and Dunbar derived 
their idea for TRADES from Dwight 
Hall Summer Painters, 
which 
employed five New Haven high school 
students to paint houses during the 
summer of 1984, they envisioned 
something larger. "I wanted to do 
something more grandiose than just 
going out and painting with kids," 
Rich said. He wanted TRADES to be 
what 
he calls a 
"public action" 
program. While public service organ-
Izations seek to advance individuals 
through scholarships and similar 
programs, TRADES, according to 
Rich, focuses on "helping people to in 
-turn help others in their own 
community." Toward this end, 
TRADES aims at providing market-
~ble skills, job experience and, most 
•mportant, the motivation and self-
discipline to work. Though Rich 
estimates that 50 percent of the 
trainees who have completed the 
program now work in the construction 
field, he says that TRADES does not 
emphasize job placement. To do so, he 
argues, would pressure the staff to 
screen out applicants who they felt 
might not succeed in the building 
trades. "All we look for is motivation," 
he said. Men and women without the 
ability to work for other painting or 
construction companies, l;le believes, 
can nevertheless benefit from their 
experience a·t TRADES. 


Their goals established, Rich and 
Dunbar began to 
seek financial 
support, for enthusiasm and good 
ideas, they realized, would not pay the 
bills. 


Because TRADES employs 
unskilled workers, it cannot support 
itself as a 
professional painting 
company does. It must rely on grants 
"Ain't nobody 
professional. You've 
just gotta keep going, 
striving to be better 
than what you are." 
from corporations and funding pro-
grams for 30 percent of its budget. 
Rich and Dunbar spent the spring of 
1985 trying to arrange funding for an 
organization whose structure they had 
not clearly defined. "We were just 
winging it," Rich confessed. They got 
the backing they needed, however, and 
by July TRADE~ was in business. 
Since then, 28 men and women have 
finished the TRADES training, and 
the company has completed about 60 
jobs, 
ranging from 
small 
indoor 
projects to a group of ten condo-
miniums. Their customers have been 
satisfied. For their restoration of a 
house in Fair Haven, TRADES won 
the Fair Haven Housepainting Prize 
and the Merit Award in 1985.

winter, when the demand for painters 
slackens. Most of the trainees never 
finished high school. The men are 
usually in their late teens and the 
women in 
their early twenties. 
Beginning at minimum wage, the 
painters work five days a week from 
eight in the morning until four in the 
afternoon. Trainees' wages grow to as 
much as six dollars an hour as their 
skills improve. There is no set training 
period; painters leave the program 
when they feel prepared to work for 
another painting company or to seek a 
job outside the trades. 


In theory, the program calls for 
three hours of classroom instruction a 
week for trainees without a diploma. 
Rich and Dunbar intended this aspect 
of the program less to prepare trainees 
to get their general education degree 
than to maintain their basic academic 
skills and their familiarity with a 
classroom situation. The TRADES 
staff and Yale 
tutors teach basic 
reading and math skills, but because 
classes come after a full day's work, 
trainees rarely appear more than once 
a week. According to Rich, TRADES 
will place more emphasis on classroom 
education in the future. The painters' 
union, 
he 
pointed out, 
requires 
members to have a 
high school 
diploma or its equivalent. 


TRADES has taken a toll on its 
creators. 
Rich and Dunbar, 
who 
designed the program intending to 
supervise their trainees on the job, 
instead found themselves putting in 60 
hours a week behind their desks. 
Dubar cited this as one reason for his 
leaving TRADES in November. Jim 
Signore!Ji (MC, '85), a coordinator for 
TRADES from the summer of 1985 
until this fall, says he left T RADES 
because he "burned out." TRADES, 
he said, 
ran 
his 
life. 
H owever, 
Signorelli refers to his time with the 
company 
as 
his "most valuable I
experience," and credits it with 
m otivating him to pursue a career as a 
public high school teacher. "This I
program couldn't have started without 
YaJe graduates," Rich said. "It needed 
their idealism a11d vision." 


Though TRADES continues to rely 
on Yale undergraduates for volunteer 
assistance, Rich has begun to draw the 
program's staff from the community. 
Trying to give -TRADES a more per-
~ 
manent structure, Rich has encouraged 
the 11 members of the TRADES board 
of directors to aid in supervising. the 
program and in planning its develop-
ment. In addition, this fall he hired an 
assistant director to help raise funds 
and a program director to supervise 
the work crews. Though in the past 
Rich and Dunbar experimented with 
bringing in professional painters-
including other Yale graduates- as 
coordinators and supervisors, they 
found 
that giving trainees more 
responsibility improved their work. 
Now, TRADES pulls coordinators, 
like Penn and Vazquez, from among 
its trainees. 


Penn and 
Vazquez 
now work 
together without supervision. 
TRADES' program director, Eddie 
H oskei, dispatches beginners from the 
training crew to work with them for 
one week each. E,·enruallv, thev will 
lead an "ad,·anced team'" of ·more 
experienced trainees. "They trust us to 
think for ourselves. now." Vazquez 
explained. Both men plan to join the 
union and eventually either start their


own companies or work for a larger 
painting 
firm. 
Though they own 
their tools an(!. on weekends, paint 
small jobs by themselves, neither feels 
ready to leave TRADES. They want to 
learn all the aspects of the business, 
from bidding on jobs to performing 
any necessary carpentry. And they like 
the TRADES management. Members 
of the staff, they said, give trainees 
second- and third- chances if they 
make mistakes or miss days at work, 
and counsel them on problems off the 
job. "They are like family," Penn said. 
"In other words, they 'are the bosses 
everyone in the world wishes they 
had." 


The example set by Penn and 
Vazquez, Rich feels, will encourage 
trainees to stay with the program by 
showing them that mobility exists 
within TRADES. In the past, he ex-
plained, 
have quit after 
being with the company only a few 
months 
because 
they are dis-
satisfied with 
their wages. 
Now, 
they might be less hasty. "A lot of them 
want to be doing what we're doing 
now," Vazques said. Rich feels that a 
certain number will always quit 
because they find 
the work too. 
difficult. But according to Penn, "Once 
you get it down pat it's easy." Vazquez 
agrees. "When you like what you're 
doing you don't think of it as work," he 
said. "And when you finish, you get a 
gOOd satisfaction because it comes out 
nice. You look at it, and all those hours 
of hard work- they don't matter 
because when you look at it at the end, 
you get a good satisfaction inside. You 
can say, We did that house.'"
