Unconventional Education 
Since 
1980 about 
thirty to fifty 
Yale students each year have taken 
Roots of Radicalism in Latin Amoica, 
designed and taught by 
History 
Professor Emilia Vioui da Costa. 
Both course and professor are virtual 
anomalies at Yale-the former, 
because one would be hard pressed to 
find here another course taught from 
the perspective of radicals, and the 
latter, because Emilia Viotti da Costa 
is the only full professor in the history 
department who is both a woman and 
Latin 
American. 
She offers 
a 
perspective on historv many Yale 
students 
find 
joltinglv 
unfamiliar. 
Many who take the course feel their 
most basic assumptions about the 
world profoundly challenged. Viotti da 
Costa believes this is what learning is 
all about -challenginl{, provoking and

if necessary, infuriating her students in 
order to keep alive the exchange of 
ideas and spirit of debate, values which 
are threatened by a pre-professional 
complacency in even the top American 
universities today. To understand the 
woman 
who 
created 
this 
unique 
history course, we must understand 
the unique history which created this 
woman. 
"Like many Brazilians," said Vioui 
da Costa, "I have many roots." Viotti 
da Costas awareness of her multi-
ethnic background is at the heart of her 
keen appreciation of different people's 
world views. Though born and raised 
in Sao Paulo, Brazil, Viotti da Costa's 
ethnic legacy links her to the Iberian 
peninsula, Genoa, Italy and Puritan 
America. Her maternal grandfather 
descended from a line of Italian liberals 
fleeing political persecution during a 
period when conservatives dominated 
Italy, and her maternal grandmother 
descended from the Dabney family of 
Boston who originally migrated to the 
American colonies on the Mayflower. 
(Technically, 
Viotti 
da Costa is 
entitled to membership in both The 
Mayflower Society and Daughters of 
the American Revolution, though she 
has never pursued this.) Two centuries 
later one Dabney married a Portu· 
guese liberal fleeing persecution to 
Brazil. They went to live in Sao Paulo 
and established themselves there as 
member of an intellectual elite. H e 
became director of Brazil's first law 
school, and many of their children had 
academic or political careers. One of 
them, Viotti da Costa's great grand· 
father, was governor of the states of 


Parana and Maranchao during the 
Empire and First Republic. 
"On my father's side," said Viotti da 
Costa, "the story was much simpler." 
Her father left poverty in a small 
village on the border between Portugal 
and Spain to follow his father who had 
come to Brazil in search of a better life. 
"[My father] was a typical self-made 
man and lived up to the ideals of what 
Max Weber called the 'Protestant 
ethic,' while the descendants of the 
Dabneys became increasingly infa-
tuated with an 'aristocratic' ethic," said 
Viotti da Costa. "That made me 
always suspicious of those cultural 
categories that are so often used in the 
study of Latin American history: the 
opposition between Protestant, Anglo-
Saxon culture and Catholic, Iberian 
culture. In my family, the stereotypes 
were reversed. 
The yankees had 
become cavaliers and the Iatinos had 
become yankees." 
Viotti da Costa grew up in an 
extended family, an experience which 
heightened her awareness of various 
ethnic, political and social groups. Her 
family included atheists, Catholics, 
Protestants and Theosophists, liberals, 
conservatives and anarchists, ruling 
elites and lower-middle classes. Some 
became 
priests, 
others military 
intelligence agents. Viotti da Costa 
recalled many lively debates at the 
dinner table, but because they were all 
family, everyone was expected to 
overcome different points of view and 
tolerate each other. "Probably the most 
important thing I learned," she said, "is 
that human experience cannot be 
reduced to simple formulas. I also 
learned to value tolerance and to abhor 
anv form of dogmatism or chau-
vinism, and to judge people for their 
achievements rather than for their 
status, for what they did rather than 
for what they said." 
She was a passionate student. Her 
mother, "a fanatic reader," introduced 
Viotti da Costa to books at an early 
age. By the time she turned 18, Viotti 
da Costa had read most of the classics 
of French and Brazilian literature, as 
well as books from Russian, English 
and other European traditions. She fell 
in love with theater, music and 
painting. "A Museum of Modern Art 
was created in Sao Paulo and I u~ed to 
spend hours admtring the work of 
Brazilian painters, which revealed to 
me a new way of seeing the world," she 
said. Early on Viotti da Costa wanted 
to become a dancer and her ballet 
teacher encouraged her to become a 
professional. "My family dissuaded me 
very quickly," she said. "As an artist 
m y aunt had faced enormous obsta-
cles, and no one was very happy with 
the idea of having another artist in the 
family." So Viotti da Costa abandoned 
her dreams of becoming a ballet 
dancer. "It was not very difficult to 
quit," she added. "Maybe my vocation 
was not so strong anyway." 
Meanwhile her high school teachers 
encouraged her to become a writer. 
During high school she won second 
place for a literary essay. First place 
went to a colleague of hers who later 
became a poet and one of the fathers of 
the concretist movement in Brazil. 
"Human experience 
cannot be reduced to 
simple formulas." 
"But I was happier with second place 
because I liked the book they gave me 
better," said V iotti da Costa. "It was 
Tolstoy's War and Peace." In her last 
year of high school, however, an 
inspiring physics teacher insisted she 
had a true vocation for physics. "I 
loved the theory of limits," said Viotti 
da Costa, "and a few years later when I 
read Plato's Dialogues I thought there 
was the same beauty born out of clarity 
and logic." Having decided to get 
married, however, Viotti da Costa felt 
she could not commit herself to the 
rigorous, full-time phystcs program at 
the University of Sao Paulo. As a wife 
she was expected to stay at home and 
look after her husband and children, 
doing the shopping, cooking, cleaning, 
"all those 'female' functions." So she 
decided to study history instead. As a 
history student she didn't have to work 
in a laboratory all day, but could do 
most of her reading at home. "To my 
husband, a woman's work was nothing 
but a hobby, and out of his generosity 
he allowed me to go to work," said 
Viotti da Costa. "My children and 
husband thought I was selfish. They 
felt I was stealing something from 
them because I went to work." 
Viotti da Costa traces her original 
love for history to her grandfather, a 
professor of literature, poet and gifted 
storyteller who spent many hours with 
his grandchildren telling them stories 
from Greek legends to Scheherazade. 
But it was only m her last year of high 
school that she found an inspiring 
history teacher. "This was the first time 
I enjoyed history," said Viotti da
