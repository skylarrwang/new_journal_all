"I imagine a man 
getting into the 
building, and going 
from apartment to 
apartment, raping 
each of us one after 
another." 
Another way to share information 
with students would be the creation of 
a crime fUe in the housing office, 
containing records of the buildings in 
which break-ins occur. 
Although 
landlords sometimes will install 
secutity devices upon request, it often 
takes a break-in for them to do so. One 
woman mentioned a landlord's reluc-
tance to install bars on the first floor 
windows of a house because that would 
jeopardize the building's status as a 
historic landmark. A well-informed 
housing office could also tell students 
which neighborhoods are statistically 
safest. 
Students will accept a lot of crime 
before they become concerned about 
it. Last year incidents of crime were 
less frequent, and as a result awareness 
of crime was low. When crime goes 
down, 
so 
will aware ;ess, 
unless 
students, police, and the administra-
tion make a concerted effort. "We are 
more afraid now than we were before 
but I don't think that this is necessarily 
a change for the worse," said Olivia. 
"We're more careful now." This year's 
crime wave may h~ve already peaked, 
but it taught ofT-campus students how 
to take precautions. 
Educating 
students now, before they move off 
campus, will prevent their having to 
learn the same lessons the hard way.
