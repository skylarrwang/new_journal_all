After leaving her country under pressure from a military dictatorship, Emilia Viotti da Costa came to the United States. At Yale, she is one of only two women tenured history professors. A native Brazilian, she hopes to dispel conventional myths about radicalism in Latin America. With Alison Gardy, she traces some of the events that have shaped her own intellectual history.
