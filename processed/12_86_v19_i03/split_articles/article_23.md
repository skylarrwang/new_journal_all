Lynwood Place looks pleasant enough 
by day. 
Linc;:d with 
trees and 
weathered brick houses, it runs parallel 
to Park Street, a block behind Pierson 
College. Students living off campus 
covet Lynwood housing for 
its 
proximity to the University. They also 
live on those streets immediately 
adjacent to 
Lynwood: 
Edgewood, 
Elm, and sections of Howe and 
Dwight. Although the area is small-it 
would take less than ten minutes to 
walk its borders- it contains the 
majority of Yale's 522 off-campus 
undergraduates. 

In early September of this year, 
students living in this neighborhood 
came under siege. Between August 31 
and September 16, 
various Yale 
students were victims of a rape, an 
attempted rape, five muggings, one 
assault, and two break-ins. The next 
week another Yale woman was raped. 
The situation 1'11ay well have been 
worse than even this indicates, because 
many crimes are never reported. "It 
was terrifying," said Olivia, who 
moved off campus this year. "For a


32 The New journal/December 6, 1985 
week I was completely obsessed with it. 
But you can't let it be a debilitating 
fear." Early September constituted a 
true crime wave which remains power-
fully in the minds of students, even 
though incidents have declined since. 

All have become more conscious of 
their vulnerability. Women especially 
have changed their lifestyles to cope, 
avoiding late-night trips to campus 
when possible, rarely if ever walking 
alone when they do. Others have 
formed a block-watch group. Few 
students criticize the New Haven 
police for being unresponsive to the 
problem, for they feel the police are 
doing all that they can. Yet virtually 
everyone thinks the Yale Administra-
tion and the Yale Police have been 
insensitive to the security needs of their 
off-campus population. Said a woman 
living on H owe, "The administration 
seems to have the attitude that students 
moving off campus are on their own." 

Since the September crime wave, 
many feel Yale can and should take 
more responsibility for the one in ten of 
its students who live off campus . 

While the area has a history of crime, 
most remain unaware of it. The neces-
sarily short collective memory of 
students, virtually none of whom stay 
in the neighborhood for more than two 
years, makes it easy for past outbreaks 
of crime to be forgotten. Students who 
move off campus for the first time tend 
to be totally unaware of the existence 
of crime at all. According to a survey 
conducted by the YCC last year, 91 
percent of off-campus students sur-
veyed believed living in an apartment 
was safe. Were that survey held this 
year, it would not be surprising if the 
percentages were reversed. "I would 
still move off," said Karen, a senior 
who has lived in her apartment for two 
years, "but not to Howe, Dwight, or 
Lynwood." 

Since the beginning of the year, 
students' perceptions concerning the 
safety of the Lynwood area have 
dramatically changed. "There was a 
definite, perceptible increase in crime 
this year," said Larry, a senior living 
off campus for his third year. "I didn't 
feel 
unsafe 
last year." Everyone

being pushed further

interviewed for this article personally 
knew at least one person who was: the 
victim of crime this year. Those who 
lived off last year acknowledged that 
while there were muggings and rob-
beries, the recent crime seemed more 
violent. 

Since September, three 
women in the area, two of them 
students, were raped in their own 
apartments. Several attempted rapes 
occurred in 
the same 
way. 
In 
November another woman was raped 
on Elm Street. 

Police officers and students differ as 
to the primary causes of this year's 
crime wave in the Lynwood area. 
Police officers believe that many of the 
robberies and muggings are motivated 
by a need to get money to buy drugs, 
especially crack. Students, on the other 
hand, shift primary responsibility for 
the crime increase away from the New 
Haven community. Sarah has lived in 
the area for two years and believes that 
the high profile of students makes the 
area a prime target. "There were a lot 
of students last year, but for some 
reason they were not as visible," she 
said. "At the start of this year there was 
a big turn over, with a lot of vans 
moving people in. 
The student 
population is more obviously present." 

Other students see the crime as an 
expression of town-gown tension, 
believing that students are victimized 
not only because of their supposed 
wealth, but because of their affiliation 
with Yale. "There's a lot of violence 
directed by New Haven residents 
against Yale students," said Esther, a 
senior. Some cite the expansion of the 
student neighborhood. "A couple of 
years ago, students did not live on 
Dwight," explained Larry. "Now, one 
block of it is virtually all students, and 
there's more each year. Now we're 
getting some feeling of resistence fro:n 
commumty members being pushed 
further out." 


More awart> nfthe increase in crime, 
many students say their mind-sets have 
changed as a result. "I didn't do any 
work for a month after the crime 
wave," said one student. "I worried 
about going to the lib~ry at nine, andÂ· 
if I was there I worried about how I 
could get home." Many still will not 
spend a night in their apartment alone. 
"I try to be careful, but I have no 
control," said Karen. "People will get 
into this apartment if they want to." 
Another woman, whose apartment 
building is filled with women living 
alone, says she has been preoccupied 
with a vision since a student was raped 
in the building next to her. "I know it 
couldn't happen, but I imagine a man 
getting into the building, and going 
from apartment to apartment, raping 
each of us one after another."
