"Last year, I didn't go 
to PROP because I 
didn't know those 
people and felt 
intimidated. I think 
that's where prejudice 
comes from, from 
intimidation from a 
group." 
When students at Yale think of the 
Coalition Against Apanheid. certain 
images tend to come to mind: a reo 
arm band tied on a sleeve, the sides of 
the shanty plastered with flyers, the 
strained faces of people chanting, the 
sound of urgent voices. Those wearing 
the arm bands, sitting in front of the 
shanties or opening their mouths to 
chant tend to be viewed as a group, in 
generalized terms. Those not involved 
often describe them as "politicall-x 
correct," liberal, 
self-righteous, or 
elite. Profiling four students here is not 
an attempt to let the movement defend 
iuelf, but an attempt to listen to four 
voices, voices that chant in unison at 
rallies but have many things of their 
own to say. 


They don't just talk about the 
reasoning behind divestment or their 
outrage over apartheid. 
Students 
leaving rallies go to classes or libraries 
or other meetings. Black students 
return 
to 
the 
white structures · 
surrounding them at Yale. A graduate 
student goes home to a dependent 
cbild. And all of them, while moving 
forward towards a goal, go back time 
and again to the past, to the source of 
their motivations, for they cannot 
separate themselves from their fAmily 
backgrounds, 
political 
orientations, 
standards of living. Away from 
th~ 
rally context, students working for 
divestment take Ofr new dimensions. 
They give a 
picture not just of 
themselves but of issues related to the-
movement against apartheid. 

Amy H olloway's black consciousness 
determines her perspective both as a 
student and as an activist. It grounds 
her opinions on classes, peers. and the 
c.oalirion Against Apartheid. Amy. TC,'89, 
commits herself ideologicaJly to homan 
rights issues, not only those wh1ch 
ooncern South Africa, and she came to 
Yale with no strong opinion on 
divestment. "I guess I was concerned 
activism was at a lull. It was something 
new for me to ~o into," she says. "I 
don't know what specifically made me 
pick the CAA. Certain things were in 
the back of my head. Plus, there was 
concern over people dying. It seemed 
like an urgent thing, so that scnte of 
urgency attracted me." Stin new to tM 
facts when she became involved last 
spring, Amy felt 
uncomfortable

Amy wears her red arm band as a 
ponytail gathering up the many $mall 
braids that cover her head. She speaks 
openly about her own problem& with 
labeling, and there is an uncertainty in 
her pauses, her eyes looking off to one 
side. "I feel So persecuted by this label

of groups, but I don't, I think about 
what I'm doing each day." Whatever 
the complexity of her views on other 
issues, Amy has a simple position on 
investments in South Africa. She looks 
straight ahead without pausing when 
she says, "We talk about liberty and 
freedom, so why do we have the nerve 
to be there? Our capitalism could make 
apartheid better, someone said once. 
But I don't want to see blacks advance 
in that type of society. I mean, here, 
bla~ks make a lot more money than 
they used to, but it's still set up in that 
hierarchy with whites at the top. so 
people say 'a black will never be 
president."' 

At a time when CAA has been 
quiet on cam pus, when burn-out from 
last spring's actions and frustration 
from this fall's suspensions have kept 
chanting at a minimum, Amy's clear 
beliefs on good and bad politics keep 
her active. "We've put a lot of energy 
into this, and the administration hasn't 
answered. But we're aware of that, and 
we're going to start doing more. I guess 
you never get a change within yourself 
unless you go up and down." 

Steve Marchese, MC 
'88, 
feels 
different from other whites in CAA. 
H e 
grew up in a 
working-class 
neighborhood in Queens, 
New 
York-a background which contrasts 
sharply with the high standard of living 
associated with Yale. H is first day in 
1984 was an important first for his 
family, none of whom had attended 
college. He came, he says, as a 
moderate moving towards the left, 
"equivocating" about politics. Rallies 
last March pulled him to Beinecke 
Plaza, and once the shanties went up 
he stayed for planning sessions late 
into the night. Now, sitting in his dorm 
room, he looks clean-cut, with a small 
mustache and dark features. Not" used 
to being interviewed, he bashfully 
admits that he has just vacuumed the 
rug. O penly expressive, he has a 
welcoming way of talking, his hands 
moving to emphasize his points. "I was 
helping with the shanty repairs and 
what really riveted me was I felt we 
had a right to have the shanties up," he 
says. "I didn't get galvanized until I felt 
there was something really wrong; die 
whole free speech issue really got me 
moving." 

Steve knows of the image many 
people have of CAA. "I think there's a 
tendency at Yale to label divestment 
activists as politicalfy correct . . . . 
They might think you're a little shrill 
and a little self-righteous. It bothers me 
a lot because I didn't get involved to be 
politically correct." Seeing himself as a

getting arrested." 
liberal in 
general 
politics but 
a 
m oderate in CAA, he has at tim es felt 
alienated. "There was a feeling in the 
group that if you didn't get arrested, 
0 
you weren't committed. It wasn't stated 
like that, but people were wearing their 
arrest tickets on their jackets. I didn't 
like feeling that I had to apologize for 
not getting arrested." 

H is reasons for being personally 
unwilling to risk arrest stem largely 
from his background. "I come from 
Archie Bunker territory," he says, "and 
it's endowed me with a more pragmatic 
strain. I always understood that when 
someone came up with a grand plan, 
there was a cost involved, and the 
people who paid weren't on Park 
Avenue but the people I was. living 
with . . .. I don't think there are a lot 
of people 
from 
background in the movement. I don't 
think that makes their commitment 
any less valid. But I think it does affect 
how they look at issues . . . they can 
afford to be ideological. For me to risk 
arrest and suspension is asking me to 
~ risk everything I've ever worked for." 

Likewise, he feels non-whites face a

greater risk of scrutiny and jucjgment 
~ 
• for getting arrested. This situation, he 
~ says, may keep some non-whites away 
~ from CAA. "I think people in the 
~ group regardless of how progressive 
they'd like to see themselves still have 
racist ideas, conscious or unconscious, 
and I include myself in this . . 
• As 
an organization we don't seem very 
approachable. Non-whites on campus 
probably see us as a white organiza-
tion." 

Steve says that non-whites do not 
join the group for two reasons. 
First- people obviously won't feel 
comfortable if they're the only non-
