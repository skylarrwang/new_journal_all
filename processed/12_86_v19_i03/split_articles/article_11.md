On the way up: TRADES trainee Keith Wiley and coordinator Roggie Vasquez. 

When Roggie Vazquez and Willie 
Penn began painting for TRADES, 
Inc., everything did not go smoothly. 
"We did some things to people's yards 
that they don't know about," confided 
Vazquez. Penn grinned as he des-
cribed accidentally dumping a bucket 
of paint over a bush on one job. 

When the owner of the house came 
into the yard to pay them, the painters, 
having cleaned up as best they could, 
acted nonchalant. "We just looked 
around at each other saying, 'Boy, 
we're glad this lady's senile!'" Penn 
recalled, laughing. 

Now, as coordinators for TRADES 
-Teen 
Rehabilitation 
and 
Development: 
an 
Experimental 
School-Penn and Vazquez train new 
painters. Penn, 20, dropped out of Lee 
High School in the twelfth grade. 
While working at the YMCA, he 
heard about TRADES and applied. 
He began painting in the summer of 
1985 and now attends evening class at 
Hamden High School to earn his 
diploma. Vazquez, 19, has been with 
TRADES since its inception in 1984 as 
Dwight Hall Summer Painters, work-
ing part-time until graduating from 
Lee High School in 1985; since then, 
he has worked for the company full-
time. 

Despite their success at 
TRADES, both say that they still have 
much to learn. "Ain't nobody profes-
sional," Penn explained. "You've just 
gotta keep going, striving to be better 
than what you are."
