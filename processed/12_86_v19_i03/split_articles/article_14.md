them). These are among the 1tems 
available only at Beinecke; together 
with the papers and archive 
photographs they com~prise the only 
surviving mark which Broch's person-
ality left on the Yale campus. 


Almost everyone who knew Broch 
agrees upon two facts: he had a great 
many lovers and he was always 
smoking a pipe. Though quiet and 
reserved, he had a strong, magnetic 
personality which caused many who 
knew him, especially women, to idolize 
h im. Mary Weigand, the wife of 
Herm an Weigand, has tremendous 
respect for Broch, but does feel that he 
needed a lot of personal attention. "He 
was narcissistic. I think all those lovers 
were in some way so many mirrors." 


Broch received many, many marriage 
proposals. Annemarie Meier-Graefe, 
who became his second wife, was so 
persistent in her efforts to marry him 
that 
he 
finally relented-on 
conditions that the marriage be secret 
and that she Oy to Paris immediately 
afterwards. When Broch died two 
years later, the marriage was still 
secret. 


Considering 
his background, 
Broch's having become a novelist at all 
is remarkable. He was born on Nov-
ember 1, 1886 to ajewish family which 
was in the textile business. When he 
was old enough, his family encouraged 
him to enter the business instead of 
going to school, and so he took over his 
family's mill at Teesdorf, which he ran 
quite successfully. The Beinecke 
archive even contains the design of a 
textile machine which Broch patented 
at this time. But Broch wished to 
pursue his intellectual interests, 


namely philosophy, and so during the 
economic crisis of the twenties he took 
the opportunity to sell the family 
business and enroll at the University of 
Vienna. 


He 
studied 
most! y 
mathematics and 
philosophy. 
H e 
planned on gaining a doctorate in 
philosophy, but the logical-positivist 
school of thought predominant at that 
time among the Vienna Circle took 
little 
interest 
in 
those 
areas 
of 
philosophy which Broch found most 
fascinating- ethics and metaphysics. 


It was at this point that Broch turned to 
literature. 


The Slttpwalkn-s, his first novel, 
appeared in 1931 , a year after Broch 
left school. This was the begining of a 
period of high productivity, during 
which he completed many essays, 
poems, a play, and worked on his 
novel Bn-groman. of which there are 
three extant versions, only one of 
which he completed. Then in 1938 the 
Nazis imprisoned Broch in Austria for 
close to a month. His imprisonment 
was not due to his being a Jew (much 
earlier, in 1909, Broch had converted 
to Catholicism, 
though from 
begining he was less than devout), but 
rather to the Nazis' incorrect belief that 
he was a communist. A number o f 
friends Oamesjoyce and other literary 
figures among them) intervened and 
managed to gain his release, but 
Broch, fearing that his J ewish origins 
would be discovered and that he would 
be reimprisoned, 
emi~rated first to 
England and then to the United States. 


In the U.S. Broch lived in New York 
and then Princeton. At Princeton he 
rented a room in the house of the 
scholar Erich Kahler, and at this point 
his circle of friends included Hannah 
Arendt, Albert Einstein, and Thomas 
Mann. In 1945, still at Princeton, he 
completed Tht Death of V1rgil. 


In 1949 Broch contacted Herman 
Weigand, then Professor of German at 
Yale, 
with whom he had started 
correspouding after the appearance of 
Weigand's 
essay two 
years 
earlier. Broch wanted to know if he 
could get a position at Yale. "He was 
hoping for an appointment as a writer-
in-residence," said Mary Weigand. 
"H e saw that things weren't going 
anywhere at Princeton, which was why 
he wanted to leave." He had also had a 
bad fall in which he shattered his hip, 
and his room at Princeton required a 
three story climb. So Yale instated 
Broch as a fellow of Saybrook College, 
where he stayed for three months, at 
the end of which time he became a 
lecturer in the German department. 


His position, however, was tenuous: 
he had no teacqing duties and httle 
salary, and his financial situation, 
weak throughout his life, allowed for 
little luxury. 


Work on 
mass 
psychology, which had started to 
fascinate him and his friend Elias 
Canetti, occupied most of Broch's 
time. H e left Saybrook for a one room 
apartment at Lake Place, where his 
books took up an entire wall. 


Shortly thereafter there began a 
movement to secure for Broch the 1950 
Nobel Prize for literature. It almost 
happened: the vote was close enough 
that Thomas Mann's influence was 
decisive. But Mann had previously 
committed his vote, and William 
Faulkner 
took 
prize. 
The 
committee slated Broch for the 1951 
prize- they later pushed it back to 
1952-but that was too late: Broch 
died on May 30, 1951 of a heart attack; 
his ashes were buried in Killingworth, 
Connecticut. 


But Broch's death may not have 
been so untimely. H e might even have 
consciously or unconsciously courted 
his death. H e had suffered a heart 
attack earlier that same year and was 
still weak, yet the day he died he had 
carried large suitcases up the flight of 
stairs to his house. Many believe that 
after completing Tht Death of Virgil he 
did not have another book in him, and 
that he probably knew this. 


His imprisonment 
was not due to his 
being ajew, but 
rather to the Nazis' 
incorrect belief that he 
was a communist. 


Broch's last months were disarm-
ingly simple: he visited his small group 
of friends, studied, and wrote letters. 
"He never got very far from his own 
mind," said Mary Weigand. "I think 
he was mainly interested in putting his 
thoughts down on 
paper." His 
thoughts at this time chiefly concerned 
his work on mass psychology and 
mathematics, and he produced little on 
"literary" subjects. 


But though 
members of the German department 
greatly respected Broch , Yale 
University had little interest in him. 
Whether it was due to his lack of 
formal academic training, or perhaps 
to some lingering anti-semitism, it is 
unlikely that Broch would ever have 
gained a substantial position at Yale. 


So now Hermann Broch resides in 
Beinecke. He has a larger room, but it 
still contains mostly books. They are 
"monstrous phenomenon" of books, to 
be sure, but "it is by no means 
unthinkable," as Weigand concluded 
in his essay, "that Broch's Death of Virgil 
should continue to stand as the 
twentieth 
century's 
towering 
monument of a mystically oriented 
spirituality." 


Mystic? Spiritual? 
Unusual adjectives to apply to a 
Modern author. It is questionable even 
whether they are accurate for Broch: 
throughout the Yale conference, he 
was kicked and tossed from one 
theoretical ground to another, and 
seemed to send roots equally deep into 
each. He took it stoically, however, 
and remained unscratched: his bust 
stared at the floor of Krista Salmon's 
office, photographs of him gazed from 
under the glass cases of the Beinecke 
exhibit, 40 or 50 people watched as 
speakers spoke and rebutters rebutted 
- and Broch's name sunk deeper into 
some wall, somewhere .
