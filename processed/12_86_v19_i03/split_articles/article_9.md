New Focus on Women 
Dinner conversations at Yale often 
serve as a forum for debate; less 
frequently, this debate translates into 
action. For Rachel Dretzin (BK,'87) 
and Sharon Portnoy (SY,'87), a dinner 
discussion over issues of feminism for 
college-age women launched a film 
project currently underway, one which 
they hope will create an unprecedented 
public voice for their generation of 
women. 

Portnoy, an English major who 
hopes to be a writer, conceived of the 
project. 
Realizing that college-age 
women face different problems today 
than they did in the 1960s, Portnoy 
decided to produce a film that would 
articulate these new concerns. She 
approached 
Dretzin, 
now in an 
advanced film workshop, with the idea 
of interviewing women from similar 
educational backgrounds to see what 
common trends of thought emerged. "I 
was electrified by the thought," Dretzin 
said. 

Dretzin and Portnoy have already 
videotaped interviews with eight to 
nine women at this point and hope to 
accumulate up to 30 or more before 
they begin filming next summer. They 
will use these interviews as raw 
research from which they may create 
fictionalized composites or retain the 
original portraits in a montage. The 
filmmakers are appealing to women's 
organizations for contributions, and 
applying for Yale-sponsored and 
public grants, in order to raise the 
thousands of dollars needed to fund 
their project. 

According to Dretzin, the women 
they have videotaped represent an 
even mix of those who consider 
themselves feminists and those who do 
not. The questions are not phrased to 
deal with feminism directly, but rather 
to explore personal anecdotes. "We're 
having people tell stories themselves, 
talk about relationships and 
friendships, and, out of that come the 
issues," Dretzin said. Strikingly, she 
and Portnoy have d iscovered that 
whether or not the inteJ;Viewed women 
view themselves as feminists, they 
bring up the same conflicts. 

Portnoy has found that most of these 
women are trying to establish full 
gender equality while still maintaining 
their female identities. This conflict 
results in academic hesitancy, 
perceived compromises in personal 
relationships, discrepencies between 
their mothers' achievements and their 
own goals, and preoccupations with 
food. Consistently, the women grapple 
in their interviews with what Dretzin 
describes as a confusion between their 
formal 
thoughts and their actual 
reactions. 

She often senses an inconsistency 
when the women talk about their 
academics. "At Yale there is this 
general assumption that women are as 
smart as men. But the amount of self-
censorship and self-negation that goes 
on before the woman's hand goes up or 
the paper is handed in is amazing," she 
said. "That is one thing that has come 
out of the interviews." 

Dretzin and Portnoy have dis-
covered that relationships present an 
arena for constant expressions of self-

doubt. 
Many of the 
interviewed 
women say that their reactions to men 
follow an almost involuntary pattern: a 
softening of the voice, and a less 
"aggressive" manner out of a fear that 
they will seem less attractive if they 
behave otherwise. They perform in a 
way that defies what they define as 
feminist. Those interviewed reveal a 
tremendous amount of confusion as to 
whether their own behavior is appro-
priate or self-betraying. 

Both Portnoy and Dretzin em-
phasize that the confusion which 
spawned these new issues existed 
20 or 30 years ago when the mod-
ern 
women's 
movement began. 
"In some sense we need to repoliticize 
the cause," Portnoy said. "We are 
reasserting that there is still a struggle." 
She has spoken to 40 and 50-year-old 
women who are surprised to find there 
are college-age feminists because few 
young women have made themselves 
heard. Portnoy sees the film as a 
"further step to freeing that lack of 
expression." 

Helen Cutting Whitney, a film-
maker who has produced numerous 
documentaries, has agreed to advise 
Dretzin and Portnoy's project and to 
aid in their grant-search process. The 
two women hope to sell their ~omÂ­
pleted film to a cable or syndicated 
television station and to show it at 
colleges. With its release, this film may 
well promp debate and soul searching 
similar to that which spawned it; that, 
Portnoy and Dretzin feel, would be a 
welcome change.
