The unique pizza at S~tly s always draws a crowd. 

L
ouis' Lunch is another small 
family business that has success-
fully weathered New Haven's 
hard times. . A small, shuttered brick 
building located at 263 Crown Street, 
Louis' looks more like an historic land-
mark than a burger joint. In reality, it 
is both, according to its owner Ken 
Lassen. 

· Lassen, a genial, graying man, 
credits his grandfather Louis Lassen 
with making the world's first ham-
burger and the world's first steak sand-
wich. Lassen himself started working 
regular hours at the family eatery at 
age twelve. "I wanted to be an archi-
tect," he confided over the counter as 
his wife Lee and his son Jeffrey bustled 
with the orders of the lunch-time 
crowd. "When my father passed away 
I became the breadwinner. I figured I 
better do what I knew best." Which is 
hamburgers. 

The way they make hamburgers 
isn't the only thing that has stood still 
at Louis' Lunch. The building itself is 
the sole remnant of a tannety complex 
from the 1780s. When the complex 
was slated to be torn down, the tiny 
building was moved to its present loca-
tion on Crown Street with the help 
and money of concerned patrons. The 
centerpiece of the building is one of 
the walls, which was rebuilt after the 
restaurant's relocation, and composed 
of bricks sent to Mr. Lassen from 
grateful customers. 

On the subject of his clientele, 
Lassen brightened. "We have the most 
beautiful clienrc:;Jsjv.b~ ~~rid ," h.e. ..., 
said expansivefy:~ Guys who grease 
cars to CEOs. I don't know where all 
the shnooks go but we. don't have 
them." 

On a "tour of the walls" Lassen 
proudly points out bricks from famous 
structures and places: a piece of King 
Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem, coral 
from French Polynesia, part of the old 
Metropolitan Opera House in New 
York. "With this wall we can make 
anyone feel at home," he declared. 

The reminders of those businesses 
Certain protocols in Louis' Lunch 
must be obeyed without question. The 
only garnishings allowed are cheese, 
onion, and tomato. Using ketchup and 
mustard is sacrilegious. The meat is 
cooked vertically in upright cast-iron 
stoves dating from 1895. Two slices of 
toast complete the recipe. "It's just like 
we stood still," Mr. Lassen observed. 
"Four generations and there hasn't 
been a millionaire yet. The money's in 
your sandwich."

not as fortunate as ·Louis', or for that 
matter Sally's, are all around the 
restaurant. Another of the eatery's 
walls is made up from bricks, collected 
by Lassen, of bulldozed small build-
ings that composed an area on Church 
Street from the Green to Crown 
Street, replaced by the now empty 
monolithic b!,lildings of Macy's and 
'its just like we stood 
still, "observes Lassen of 
Louis' Lunch. "Four 
generations and there 
hasn't been a millionaire 
yet. The moneys in your 
sandwich. " 
other big retail stores. "This wall rep-
resents alhhe tears from the mom and 
pop businesses that were destroyed to 
make way for the downtown you see 
today," Lassen said softly. 

Sitting at the polished wooden 
counter under the shadow of its elder-
ly beams, listening to the slightly bent 
man leaning beside his cast iron stoves, 
diners feel a warm glow-and it's not 
from the stove. 

Here stand tenacious 
survivors, both the man and his eatery, 
secure in their faith in New Haven, 
safeguarding their tradition and histo-
ry long after the structures of their cor-
porate rivals sit empty and decaying. 

Like Sally's, Louis' Lunch can lay claim 
to a piece of American history. With a 
dedication to the quality of the food 
they produce and the well-being of the 
people they serve, both Sally's and 
Louis' plan to stand by New Haven 
through thick and thin.
