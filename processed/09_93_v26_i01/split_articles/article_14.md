b Long (TC '87) and Dan Staley (BK '85) never 
eld much sacred. When Staley and Long were 
utting on their first play at Yale, Staley broke the 
Branford piano in an attempt to move it. Needless to say, he 
met with a good deal of anger from the master. As the editor 
of the Trumbulletin his junior year, Long printed one stu-
dent's mock suggestion that the master and his wife embez-
zle a $1,500 donation to the college to purchase new 
wardrobes. "They interpreted it as a slam against their pre-
sent wardrobe," recalls Long in mock innocence. 

Now, nearly ten years later, the pair has traveled from 
New Haven to Hollywood, where they now stretch their 
irreverent humor to the limit in television writing. Serving 
four seasons on Cheers, first as staff writers and later as co-
executive producers, Staley and Long, 30 and 28 years old, 
respectively, are now consulting for the new CBS sitcom Big 
~we Dave's which premiered on August 9 to mixed reviews. 

Coming from Yale, Staley and Long constantly face the 
conflict between Ivy League intellectualism and the notion 
of mass culture.a Ia television. Long says, "The hard thing 
for me is that when you tell people who are sort of. East 
Coast inteQectuals that you write for television, they imme-
diately think, 'Why are you destroying our culture?'" 

Long,"however, maintains that his is honest, legitimate 
work. "When we would sit around and come up with a joke, 
and I would laugh, I would think, 'Well, I'm laughing, so 
maybe I'm a complete schmuck or a philistine,"' he says with 
a shrug. "'Maybe I'm on the low end of the mass culture 
scale, but if so, at least I'm being honest. Where you run into 
trouble-and this happens with over-educated people-is 
that they sort of sit in a room and say, 'Well, I don't think it's 
very funny, but the people will; the little underlings some-
where in Iowa will think it's hilarious.' 

"You find a lot of Ivy League, a lot of Yale, kids who 
come here, who have never been really funny in their lives, 
but who are kind of smart, and write for some. piece of shit 
show that's terrible, and they don't really care, because 'it's 
not for me,"' says Long. "I think that's selling out." Long 
gestures vehemently. 

Staley criticizes the predictable sentimentality of much 
of television writing, which Cheers rejected with its irreverent 
humor. "Rob and I are going to have a problem at some 
point because most TV shows have what's called a 'moment' 
towards the end, where the characters hug and say, 'I love 
you, Mommy.' Cheers was one of the few shows that didn't

have one of those 'moments,"' says Staley. "It's very difficult 
for both of us to write that kind of thing." 

Staley characterizes their brand of humor as harsher 
than the norm. "We tend to concentrate more on the hard 
jokes .. .laugh, laugh, laugh all the way through. We never did 
shows about issues. We never did shows that ended up with 
some schmaltzy embrace between the characters." 

Long interrupts: "Which is actually quite rare in televi-

en speaking about their partnership, though, 
Long and Staley approach the sentimentality that 
they eschew in their writing. Staley, a new father, 
sits on a white wooden-framed couch in their cool bungalow 
office. Long sits to the right in a matching chair, sipping his 
bottled water. Most of the time one will listen attentively 
while the other speaks, but every so often either Long or 
Staley will chime in to affirm his partner's thought. 

"Some teams tend to divide the work, where one guy 
will write one scene, and the other will write another, but we 
tend to work directly with each other all the way through," 
says Staley. "Both of us are just funnier and come up with 
better stuff together-than we 
would sitting down and 
writing the stuff by our-
selves. And you kind of

up leading to a funnier product." 

The two have developed a 
rapport. "We've been doing this 
for so long that we kind of have 
a shorthand. We've been writing 
together for ten years," says 
Staley.

"The bad news is," interjects 
Long a bit facetiously, "it's often hard 
to tell." 

L
ong's Yale education left him 
well-versed in mass culture stud-
ies. Working in television, he.1 
holds a firm opinion as to where it fits ·. 
into the social scheme. "If TV were . 
pure entertainment and never attempt-
ed to be anything other than entertain-
ment, I think people would watch 
maybe one hour a nigh~," says Long. 
"But it has this obsessive, narcotizing 
effect, and notice all these TV shows: 
even the really bad ones have a little 
moral at the end. 

"What could be more pious than 
M1V? Every two hours, there's a mes-
sage," he says. "During the election, it 
was impossible to watch. It was like, 
'You goita vote, man!' LL Cool J telling 
you to vote. Just please, shut up and 
play a video. It's not any more legiti-
mate." 

Long sees himself as purely an 
entertainer, nor.an educator. According 
to him, the view 'tfiat television is a 
teaching tool oversimplifies the notion 
of education. "The lesson of Sesame 
Smet is that it's easy," he says, ridicule 
seeping through his voice. "That all 
you have to do is watch it. And num-
bers add themselves, and letters speak, 
and everything is puppets, and it's real-
ly easy, and then you sing a song. Not 
true. Things are difficult, and they 
take time to plow through." 

However, Long censures not only 
the industry itself but also its intellec-
tual critics. "I would be happier if I 
could find at least one American

Studies professor, who, when he or she 
talks about mass culture and popular 
culture, wasn't on the way to making a 
Marxist or socialist argument," says 
Long. 

"I'd be a lot more comfortable 
with that ifl didn't already know where 
their conclusion was. You already know 
that the conclusion is that it's designed 
to pacify the masses with these weird 
spectacles, so they won't notice whatev-
er terrible thing the government's 
doing today. 

"My glib answer to that is that 
American Studies professors have 
invented a whole way of looking at 
popular culture, so that they can go to 
Arnold Schwarzenegger movies and 
not feel guilty about it. They can go 
and say, 'Well, I can go back and study 
it,"' says Long. 

R:
ght now, Long and Staley have 
no plans to go back and study 
nything. From the moment 
they left Xale, talent and luck propelled 
them into quick success. The pair 
could never write a sitcom about their 
·transition from film school standout 
and "copy {est kid" to television execu-
tives. Thelesson would be too much 
like that of s~sam~ Strut-"that it's 
easy," in Long's words. Every episode 
would end with a pat "moment"-
their first script, their first agent, their 
first contract, even Staley's first baby. 

It's difficult to fault them for their 
success. 

They've worked 
hard. 

Hollywood has been good to them . . 
But success hasn't come so easily for 
many in their audience. It's under-
standable that some might crave the 
sentimentality that Long and Staley 
decry. With the close of Chen-s, the pair 
faces an uncertain future. They must 
now find a new home for their hard-
knocks humor. Will anyone answer the 
door?
