Once upon a time, New Haven high school students received special consideration from Yale. To strengthen relations between the university and the city, Yale set aside scholarships and places in each class for Elm City grads. But in the 1960s, New Havenites lost this preferential treatment in the application process. Today, few New Haven high school graduates enter Yale each year.

The university has often been criticized for not having enough city kids within its hallowed halls. With only four entering Yale this fall, city public school graduates will make up just a tiny percentage of a freshman class of more than 1,200. Both Yale and New Haven educators and activists would like the number of city kids in Yale's classrooms to increase. But no one is quite sure how.


In 1911, Yale offered two full-tuition scholarships to New Haven high school graduates based on merit and financial need. Within ten years the program grew to include 24 additional scholarships. Yale replaced this arrangement in 1958 with the City of New Haven Scholarship Program, under which six scholarships were awarded annually: one to a Hillhouse High School graduate, one to a Wilbur Cross High School graduate, and four to graduates of any of the secondary schools within New Haven's city limits. This scholarship program essentially created a quota system in which at least six New Haven students would be admitted annually.

In the 60s, Yale's scholarship policy changed. Financial need alone determined financial aid. Yale's Financial Aid Office applied the same funding formulas for all admitted candidates to Yale College. New Haven students lost their special scholarships and quotas.

Yale President A. Bartlett Giamatti (SY '60) re-instituted "scholarships" for New Havenites in 1979. Called the Sterling Scholarships, these awards are essentially merit-based, honorary designations. Sterling Scholars who do not qualify for financial aid receive no monetary award, while those who do qualify have the self-help portion of their package reduced. New Haven students, however, have not recovered their former numbers with these new scholarships.

Many educators and students support the present policy despite well-publicized criticism. Bert Saxon, in charge of the programs for gifted and talented students at Hillhouse High School, is content with the present relationship between his school and Yale. "Admitting through a quota system is a mistake. A system that allows flexibility is much better," he says. According to Saxon, Yale generally admits around ten New Haven students per year, with some years' admissions dipping to four or five, other years' reaching as high as fourteen or fifteen. Saxon does not want Yale to lower its standards in order to admit more New Haven applicants.

Some New Haven students at Yale concur. Orlando Cordero (BK '96), a graduate of New Haven's Career High School, insists that the "most qualified students" should get the spots. "New Haven students should not be treated any differently," he adds. "When I got in," says Wilbur Cross graduate Janna Wagner (JE '95), "I felt like I only got in because I'm from New Haven. The problem with quotas is that they create stigmas and stereotypes. No one wants to be known as the token New Haven Public School Kid."

Another Ivy League University has had success with scholarship quotas. The University of Pennsylvania, like Yale, is an affluent school in an impoverished neighborhood. Unlike Yale, though, Penn has an agreement with the city of Philadelphia to award at least $2 million worth of financial aid a year-the equivalent of 125 full tuition scholarships-to city high school graduates. The "Mayor's Scholarships" program requires that at least 125 Philadelphia students be enrolled at Penn at any given time. The school has no difficulty filling this quota. More than 300 Philadelphia students attended the school last year, and 113 more will enter as first-year students this year. William Schilling, Penn's Director of Undergraduate Financial Aid, says, "The money isn't capped at $2 million. The money given to Philly students exceeds $2 million every year."

But Yale would have difficulty finding enough candidates for 125 scholarships. Philadelphia has a larger population, and its school system produces greater numbers of
