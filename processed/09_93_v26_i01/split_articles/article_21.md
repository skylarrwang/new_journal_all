**The Fun of Administration**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Would you do better to try to upgrade 
athletic facilities or career counseling 
services? Support new interdisciplinary 
programs or fix more antiquated bath-
rooms? 

Such choices in reality come up not 
in pairs but as the rivalry of each desir-
able thing against every other one. Each 
claim comes wi'th direct educational 
benefits if adopted and possibly dire 
consequences if neglected. At the same 
time, when decisions must be made, 
there's no knowing for sure which 
choice will prove to have been the best 
or wisest-only the certainty of dis-
pleasing those who counseled on the 
other side. Trying to make intelligent 
choices while working in this particular 
darkness is the fun of administration. 

Two things help here. 
First, 
administration at Yale is a high-
ly collegial affair. Almost noth-
ing at Yale has ever been accomplished 
autocratically. Successful management 
has instead involved large amounts of 
consultation with faculty, students, 
staff, and administrative colleagues, so 
that none of us move forward with our 
own unaia~d light. Second, the aca-
demic culfure of Yale puts a much 
lower premium on administrative 
affairs than it does on intellectual ones. 
Yale is sometimes inefficient as a result, 
but the healthy consequence is that Yale 
tends not to forget what management is 
in the service of-what educational 
goals bureaucracy is trying to effect. 

In these conditions, I'm happy to 
make a temporary deviation into the 
administrative zone. Having a job like 
my current one is the only way to get a 
sense of how the whole of Yale works. 
So I greet it as a new phase of my edu-
cation-and after I've done it for a 
while, it'll be someone else's turn, and 
I'll cross back into my more usual habi-
Ut.
