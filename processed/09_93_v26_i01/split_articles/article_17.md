n the fall of 1991, Steven Rosenstein (SY '93) returned 
to Yale with his girlfriend of three months, Natalia 
Kashirina. 
Rosenstein, fluent in Russian, and 
Kashirina, a native of the former Soviet Union, met at a 
world peace camp in the United States that summer. 
Although Kashirina's visa required that she return home in 
September, the two could not bear to part. . 
"Those weeks were in turmoil. We made plans for me 
to visit her or for her to visit me, but it seemed such a long 
way away," recalls ·Rosenstein. The thought of separation 
grew so unbearable that Rosenstein decided t:o take a bold 
step. "I took her airplane ticket a,nd I tore it up so that she 
couldn't go back. I didn't exactly say, 'Will you marry me?' 
right then, but when I tore up her ticket that was the natu-
ral thing to do." They got married ~t New York's City Hall 
·and Rosenstein withdrew from Yale for a year. Life was so · 
hectic that they did not have time for a honeymoon. 


Michael South (CC '94) and Kristen Hacken South 
(CC '93) met the summer of 1989-after she had been 
accepted to Yale and he had just completed his first year-
through a mutual friend in their hometown of Salt Lake 
City. They grew close by summer's end but had to put 
their relationship on hold as South embarked on a two-year 
mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day 
Saints, or the Mormon Church. South went to Germany 
while Hacken South, also a Mormon, went to Yale. They 
kept in close touch for two years and finally reunited in 
New Haven over Thanksgiving 1991. They became 
engaged that week. South re-enrolled in the winter, and 
they married in Salt Lake City the following June. 

Getting married while attending college is a difficult 
and unusual choice. Those who do often face increased 
financial responsibility, suddenly complicated life decisions, 
and the startled reactions of peers and friends. During the 
1992-93 school year, only five Yale undergraduates, not 
counting special students, chose to brave such pressures. 
Their stories are as dissimilar as their personalities-from 
Rosenstein's impulsive shredding of Kashirina's plane ticket 
to the Souths' singularly dedicated long-distance courtship. 
The couples are alike only in their remarkable content-
ment. 


orne people think it is the coolest thing and oth-
ers think it's the craziest thing," says married 
undergraduate Roger Burton (BK '94). He treats

the mixed bag of reactions to him and his spouse Leann 
Wyler with a shrug. "Some people might think I am more 
mature. Some might wonder why I did it, but I really don't 
worry about what they think." 

. 

Burton and WyJer first met in junior high, but did not 
start dating until the end of their sophomore year of high 
school. After two years of dating seriously, they got 
engaged. "The wedding was never an immediate event in 
our minds. We felt that if we still felt like getting married 
in a few years, we should go ahead and do it," says Burton. 
"When he fir!>t left for school, I almost felt abandoned 
because we used to spend all our free time together," says 
Wyler, who remained in their hometown of Seattle. After 
two years of long-distance phone calls, numerous letters, 
reunions over breaks, and care packages on birthdays, 
B~rton and Wyler's commitment to eactt other did not 
waver, nor did their wish to rharry weaken. On May 30, 
1992, they tied the knot. Their medium-sized wedding

marry me?' right then, but that was

included 150 family members and friends, five of whom 
were Yalies. Burton's roommate served as best man. After a 
week's honeymoon on the Oregon coast and a summer 
spent in Seattle, the newlyweds moved to New Haven. 

For Wyler, leaving the hometown environment topk 
some adjustment. "I've lived in the same house in Seattle 
my entire life. It was really hard being away from my par-
ents and friends," says Wyler. She began working full-time 
at Temple Radiology, leaving her little time to meet people. 
"I tried to do more stuff at home and not to be away as 
much," says Burton. "I also tried to reassure her, especially 
when I was busy and seemed a little distant." During the 
year, they would spend a typical evening making dinner 
and watching TV before Burton did his schoolwork. 

The couple's parents helped smooth the transition to 
married life. They bought Burton and Wyler a truck, pay 
for its insurance, and cover the couple's rent during the 
school year. Burton's grandparents even send unannounced

checks in the mail from rime to time. 

Wyler retains her maiden name and has not decided if ] 
she will change it. "It is a big decision for me but I've been 
putting it off. I don't see why a woman should always 
change her name." Burton ftas not pressured Wyler either. u 
"I never felt it was fair for me to force my name on her. I f 
just tried to support her decision," says Burton. Wyler sug-
gesred to Burton that he change his surname to hers, but 
she says that he did not like that idea much. 

Burton riores that his new lifestyle has not strained his 
Yale riendships. Burton continues to have lunch in his col-
lege and to visit his former roommates regularly. "I don't 
think my friends see me as separate from them because I 
am married," he says. His friends assured Burton of their 
support when they threw him a surprise bachelor party at 
the end of his sophomore year. His roommates secretly 
flew Wyler in for the weekend as the surprise guest. With 
Burton blindfolded, the crowd cheered loudly as Wyler 
kissed her soon-to-be husband. "I feared the worst," says 
Burton, "and thought that they hired a stripper." 

R
osenstein and Kashirina's romantic and short 
engagement made many of Rosenstein's friends gasp 
n horror. "I was kind of a wild parrier back in my 
single days. I have many memories of standing in a stair-
well for a cup of beer," says Rosenstein. "I'm probably the 
last person in the world that people would have expected 
~o get married." 

Rosenstein finds that life at Yale became easier after 
marriage. "People who are preoccupied with dating and 
meeting people can invest quite a bit of time and energy in 
the social scene. Going out on top of your school work can 
be really tiring," observes Rosenstein, who does not miss 
his old way of life. "Being married requires you to invest 
quire a bit of time, but not in the same way. It's probably 
invested in a more productive, more healthy way." 

Rosenstein dismisses the assumption that early mar-
riage is constraining. "Marriage does change you," he says. 
"Many people might want to wait until they are established 
in a career and are financially secure. But by that time, 
you're set in your own ways and less likely to grow and 
change. Natalia and I are still changing, but we're growing 
together as a team." The two will fly to St. P~tersburg this 
August-she to reunite with friends and family, he to meet 
his in-laws for the first time.

or South and Hacken South, marriage at ages 22 and 
20, respectiv~y, fo~ow.s convention in the Morm~n 
community. We didn t really see any reason to walt, 
although it sounds a little odd our here where people get 
married a lot later," says Hacken South. Most of their 
friends in Utah have married, while others worry if they

have not yet found a mate. 

Being away from their communi-
ty in Utah has tested their strength 
and reliance on one another. They 
help overcome their homesickness by 
living in an apartment complex that 
houses several Mormon graduate stu-
dents. 

The fact that they are the only 
undergraduates married to each other 
has given them some notoriety as "the 
Mormon couple." Weeks before they 
married, their wedding invitation 
appeared on the bulletin board of 
Calhoun College. 

The odd remarks and occasional 
double-takes they encounter have yet 
to dishearten the Souths, but Hacken 
South quickly notes they always come 
from people who do not know them 
well. " I think we get funny looks 
from undergraduates who have a hard 
time comprehending the idea of mar-
riage in college," 
she says. 

" 
Sometimes we laugh with them 
because we realize, they're shocked. It's 
the life that we've chosen. I figure 
we're giving them some cultural 
awareness. .. 

The Souths feel that their choice 
to start a new life is one that other Yale 
undergrads might happily make, given 
a stronger sense of commitment. "I 
certainly think more people I know 
here could get happily married right 
now. I just don't think I've met many 
who are willing to commit them-
selves," says South ... They're unsure of 
the outcome." 

The Souths, who are expecting a 
child in December, are not leading the 
typical Yale life. From their atypical 
experience comes a different type of 
growth, a different type of change. 
The Souths look to each day knowing 
rhat there is someone to watch over 
them. And for all these couples, that 
thought makes them all the happier.
