they reached the summit, where they 
found a small hut and a few Indian 
families who farmed these upper reach-
es. Arteaga told Bingham that he want-
ed to stay and chat with the farmers, so 
a boy was sent to accompany Bingham 
and Carrasco to the ruins. 


As they rounded a promontory, 
Bingham· caught sight of a fabulous 
spectacle. Clear in the midday sun, a 
flight of stone terraces ranged up the 
mountainside, outlined against the 
dark river canyon below. Buildings of 
hewn stone stood, crumbling, over-
grown, yet still majestic, in front of a 
conical, cloud-shrouded mountain that 
marked the end of the ridge. A grand, 
ruined city lay spread out before him. 
Thrust out over a bend in the 
Urubamba, Machu Picchu seemed to 
float above the canyon, surrounded on 
three sides by mountains and air. 


Bingham wandered around the 
superb ruins, avoiding the jungle 
growth that blanketed the site as he 
photographed structures and jotted in 
his notebook. On one of the ruined 
walls, he noticed the words "Lizarraga 
1902" scrawled in charcoal, indicating 
that someone other than Arteaga and 
the Indians h'ad been there before him. 
The sitoi although blessed with a 
splendid view and a lovely location, 
matched none of the clues a historian 
in Lima had given Bingham to help 
him identify the last Inca capital. 
Machu Picchu was obviously not 
Vitcos, the lost city, but simply one of 
the many Inca ruins Bingham had 
passed and photographed on his way 
down the Urubamba. After taking a 
few more pictures and sketching a 
rough map, Bingham descended, 
returned to the camp, and, the next 
day, continued his search for the last 
Inca capital. A few weeks later, almost 
as an afterthought, Bingham asked 
Tucker and Lanius to return to Machu 
Picchu to clear and map the site. 


Bingham seemed so thirsty for recogni-
tion that he acted as if any stone he 
tripped over in Peru, or any bone he 
picked up, was somehow the most 
important archaeological find of the 
century. But when he found Machu 
Picchu, the city that would make his 
name world-famous, he passed it by. 
Bingham asked, 
"Would anyone believe 
what I had found?" 


He did find Vitcos in the end, as well 
as another major Inca site further up 
the Urubamba. In six months of travel 
and exploration, he completed all the 
expedition's objectives, from the ascent 
of Coropuna to the survey of the 73rd 
Meridian. 


But, upon his return, 
Bingham continued to expound on the 
"Cuzco bones," convinced that they 
were his most momentous find. He 
devoted over two pages in his prelimi- . 
nary report to the bones and only seven 
lines to Machu Picchu. 


But Machu Piq:hu was the discov-
ery that wo'iild claim the popular 
imagination. Breathtaking pic-
tures of the city and the surrounding 
landscape accompanied Bingham's arti-
cles, which appeared in Harpers 
Monthly and National Geographic. The 
sheer romance of Bingham's tale of dis-
covery, coupled with the striking beau-
ty of the place, made Machu Picchu 
memorable. Bingham himself thanked 
his fortune at having the photographic 
proof of his adventure. "Would anyone 
believe what I had found?" he wrote in 
his 1948 book, Lost City of the Incas, 
",Fortunately, in this land where accura-
cy in reporting what one has seen is not 
a prevailing characteristic, I had a good 
camera and the sun was shining." 


Once he caught on to Machu 
Picchu's popularity, Bingham lost no 
time in recasting himself in the role of 
"The Great Explorer." The frontispiece 
of Inca Land, a book he published in 
1922 for popular consumption, is a 
photograph showing Bingham stand-
ing on ·a jungle path, his back to the 
camera, gazing at the misty mountains 
looming beyond. His discovery became 
fraught with destiny. "It has been my 
lot to cross bleak Andean passes," 
Bingham wrote in Inca Land, "as well 
as to wend my way through gigantic 
canyons into the dense jungles of the 
Amazon Basin." 


He allowed himself greater embel-
lishments in the subsequent retellings 
of the journey. What was once an ordi-
nary hike up the mountainside became 
an epic trek through a mysterious land. 
"Above all," he wrote in Lost City of the 
Incas, "there is the fascination of find-
ing here and there, under swaying 
vines, or perched on top of a beetling 
crag, the rugged masonry of a bygone 
race." 


As if to make up for his initial dis-
regard for Machu Picchu, Bingham. 
even took pains to assign the city much 
greater importance in Inca history than 
it merited, augmenting the fame of the 
city as well as his own. Bingham drew 
on a questionable myth about the ori-
gin of the Incas in order to "prove" that 
he had found the legendary first capital 
of the Inca empire. Present-day archae-
ologists, however, have concluded that 
Machu Picchu was simply a resort 
town where Inca officials found refuge 
from their responsibilities in Cuzco. 
The placement of Machu Picchu on a 
picturesque ridge was not accidental; 
the Inca builders had intentionally 
sought a pleasant spot on which to 
build their retreat. 


Bingham's most serious emenda-
tion lay in his sole claim as the 
discoverer of the site. After his 
first visit to the city, where he saw a 
name and date literally written on the 
wall, Bingham had jotted down in his 
journal, "Agustin Lizarraga is the dis-
coverer of Machu Picchu." In Inca 
Land, Bingham continued to credit 
Lizarraga, a farmer in the hills below 
Machu Picchu. But by his 1930 report 
to fellow scholars on his excavations at 
the site Bingham had dubbed Lizarraga 
a mere "treasure-hunter," immediately 
discounting 
the 
legitimacy of 
Lizarraga's presence at the site. By Lost 
City of the Incas in 1948, Lizarraga's 
name no longer appeared, and, in the 
introduction to the book, Bingham 
declared, "I found it." 


Although other independent 
sources in Cuzco, like Bingham's friend 
Albert Giesecke, had pointed the way 
to Machu Picchu, Bingham's writings 
made it seem as if his discovery was 
simply splendid serendipity. As early as 
1916, Bingham wrote of Machu 
Picchu that, "with the exception of a 
few local Indians, no one in Peru was 
aware of its existence." 


Throughout Bingham's fabulous 
journey, "Indians" hover in the back-
ground as supporting characters, as 
Bingham's guides, porters, interpreters, 
or hosts. In many of Bingham's pic-
tures, one can see 
them standing sui:. 
lenly next to .the 
huge 
stonework 
doors or crumbling 
walls their· ancestors, 
the Incas, built. 
Bingham liked to 
include people to 
add human interest 
and to provide scale 
to the buildings, as 
archaeologists pho-
tograph 
pennies 
beside arrowheads 
to give an idea of 
relative 
size. 


Bingham's son and 
biographer, Alfred 
Bingham, in his 
retelling of the 
young 
Peruvian 
porter's death, sug-
gests that perhaps 


Bingham often used the phrase 
"bygone race" to refer to the Incas, as if 
the native Peruvians he met on his trav-
els were not descended from those 
Incas. Perhaps he could not in his 
mind connect the extreme poverty and 
adversity of the Peruvians of his present 
with the riches and grandeur of the 
Incas of the past. Bingham always 
remained suspicious of his Peruvian 
companions' dedication to truth. "In 
this country," he wrote, "one can never 
, tell whether a report is worthy of cre-
dence." 


Bingham owed the inhabitants of 
Peru frtuch, although, after his discov-
ery of Machu Picchu, his public recog-
nition of the extent of their and 
Giesecke's, Lizarraga's, and Arteaga's 
contribution grew smaller as his own 
fame expanded. It began to seem that, 
even for Bingham, Peru still remained 
a land where accuracy in reporting was 
indeed not an expected characteristic. 


Bingham argued in a 1922 letter 
that he had discovered Machu 
Picchu in the same sense that 
Columbus 
discovered 
America. 
Although Norse sailors and French 
fishermen had undoubtedly visited 
America before Columbus did, 
Bingham wrote, "It was Columbus 
who had introduced America to the 
civilized world." It was Bingham who 
had brought Machu Picchu out of the 
jungle -into the world's gaze, not those 
who had guided him to Machu 
Picchu. They, the supporting charac-
ters, re~eded into the wings as the 
great explorer Hiram Bingham took 
center slage, in the light of worldwide 
f.une. 


Hiram Bingham represented not 
just the brilliance of an age, but also 
some of its darker impulses. Explorers 
had seen so much and had been to so 
many places, yet their own image of 
themselves grew to fill their vision and 
blocked out the truth of their travels. 
Yet "The Great Explorer" continues to 
exert a hold on the collective imagina-
tion. Many would have done as Bingham did, for the explorer inhabits 
a singular location in cultural memo-
ry: guilty of much-yet still a hero . ..
