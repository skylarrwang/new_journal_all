iscovery was a hobby, and "explorer" a legitimate
occupation in the early years of this century. It was
an age when Peary and Cook battled over who had
first reached the North Pole, as foreigners swarmed into
Central Asia's trackless Taklamakan Desert in search of
buried treasure on the old Silk Road. Travelers brought back
tales of forgotten cultures and glorious riches; the accounts
of their travels appeared in magazin.es under tides like
"Adventuring Along the Upper Orinoco" or "With the
Dayaks of Borneo." It was an era that bred self-styled heroes,
who spun tales redolent with danger and mystery to mask
trying and often pedestrian treks through the backwaters of
the world. It was a time whe~ the world was a stage and the
world's peoples the backdrop against which Americans and
Europeans played out the drama of discovery, casting them-
selves as conquistadors, not of cultures but of the unmapped
globe.

It was this age that brought H iram Bingham (B.A.
1898), Yale professor and leader of the Yale Peruvian
Expedition, to the hidden reaches of Peru in the late summer
of 1911. On his journey through the backlands of the Andes
he would discover the most famous ancient site in the
Americas-Machu Picchu, "Lost City of the Incas." This
complex of stone terraces and temples that Bingham stum-
bled upon, nesded on a ridge high above the jungle and roar-
ing waters of the Urubamba River, possessed a visual power
few places on Earth could ever match. The story of Hiram
Bingham's penetration of the forbidding Andes has come to
symbolize the triumph and romance-as well as the darker
side--of early scientific exploration.

Thirty-six years old, blond, over six feet tall, and always
dressed smartly-at least in photographs from the expedi-
tion-in a pith helmet or a fedora, jodhpurs, and calf-length
boots, Bingham looked every bit the gentleman explorer.
Educated at Andover, Yale, and Harvard, and married to an
heiress to the Tiffany fortune, he had the credentials of an
American aristocrat. Bingham came from famous stock. He
was third in a line of American pioneers that all bore the
name of Hiram Bingham. Bingham's grandfather had led the
first mission to Hawaii and had engineered the island
monarchy's transitionto a Christian nation-state, while
Bingham's father, Hiram Jr., had preached in the Gilbert
Islands in Micronesia and gave the islands' inhabitants a
Gilbenese translation of the Bible. Bingham began his adult
life intending to follow in the track of his missionary fathers,
but a life of piety and self-denial did not suit his native rest-

lessness and unquenchable curiosity. Where his forbears had
made their name in the spread of religion, Bingham decided
to make his in the new faith of science.

Bingham found himself slipping into one role after
another, searching for some promise of fame. After a brief,
unhappy stint as pastor of a mission in Honolulu, Bingham
took up graduate ·studies at Berkeley and at Harvard. He
maneuvered himself into the job of "Curator of Latin
American History and Literature" at Harvard, a position
which allowed him to travel to South America on the pretext
of searching for books. Bingham, though, had more than
books on his mind. In South America, he embarked on his
first journey of exploration: an expedition across Venezuela
and Colombia in the

Bingham want-
ed to return to South
America to conduct
further travels-any
country would do.

His suggested expedition to Peru, however, interested
prospective sponsors most. He was able to scrape together
enough money from his personal funds, Yale University, and
wealthy Yale schoolmates like Edward S. Harkness to put
together an expedition of magnificent scope.

As director of the Yale Peruvian Expedition, Bingham
set out with great ambitions: the ascent of Mt. Coropuna,
SEPTEMBER 3· 1993

then thought to be the highest mountain in South Amer ca;
the exploration of uncharted waterways and lakes of P ru;
and the search for forgotten Inca ruins in the dense and mys-
terious province of Vileabamba. Ta connect the far-flung
areas of his exploration, he proposed to map the 73rd
Meridian, which links the mountains of southern Peru with
Coropuna near the Pacific coast.

B
ingham had come to Peru in search of a legend, a lost
city that was one of the last refuges of the once-great
Inca empire. After the Spanish conquistadors took
over Peru in 1532, Francisco Pizarro installed Manco Inca as
his puppet on the Inca throne. Manco Inca, however; proved
an unwilling vassal and soon laid siege to Cuzco and even
Lima itself. The Spanish armies forced Manco Inca and his
armies to flee Cuzco into Vileabamba, a rugged province
northwest of Cuzco. It was here in Vileabamba that Manco
Inca built Vitcos, the hidden capital of the Inca empire, a
city rumored to be bursting with gold. Somewhere in the
jungles of Vileabamba, Hiram Bingham knew, a losi: city
slept, waiting for the day when a new conquistador would
awakeQ it.

Bingham sailed from Lima to a port on the southern
coast and then boarded a train headed into the mountains of
Peru, where Cuzco, the center of the old Inca empire, await-
ed. In Cuzco, Bingham visited an old friend, an American
with a penchant for Inca ruins whom he had met on an ear-
lier visit to Peru-Albert Giesecke, the young rector of the
University of Cuzco. Giesecke mentioned to Bingham a trip
he had taken along the Urubamba River in Vileabamba a
few months before Bingham's arrival. Giesecke had stopped
at a small inn at a bend in the river, in a place called Mandor
Pampa, where the proprietor, Melchor Arteaga, offered to
show him some good ruins on top of a ridge nearby. Since
Giesecke was traveling in the rainy season, Arteaga told him
it might be be.tter if he returned in the drier months.

Bingham had luckily shown up during Peru's dry season, and
Giesecke decided to pass along this "tip" to his friend, the
explorer.

While Bingham made preparations in Cuzco, the expe-
dition specialists began the various tasks they had gone to
Peru to accomplish. An advance party of the expedition doc-
tor, William Erving (B.A. 1898), and the group topogra-
pher, Kai Hendricksen, met Bingham with equipment and
supplies for the journey ahead. Yale colleagues Isaiah
Bowman (GRD '09) and Harry Ward Foote had made the
difficult journey with Bingham from New Haven to 'Cuzco.
Herman L. Tucker, a young drifter who had some moun-
tain-climbing experience, came along to assist in the ascent

of Corupu!la. The last member of the
expedition, a Yale undergraduate by
the name of Paul Baxter Lanius ('12S)
became Bingham's assistant. Lanius'
knowledge of Spanish proved useful,
since the other members of the Yale
Peruvian
Expedition-Bingham
included-spoke little more than a
smattering of Spanish. None knew ter-
ribly much about the Incas or about
Peru, but together they gave Bingham's
fantastic and maybe foolhardy quest
the semblance of a scientific endeavor.

ne incident in Cuzco is indica-
tive of Bingham's skill at sell-
ing himself and his expedition
and his not-as-well-developed facility
with science. Bingham and Foote,
while strolling in the city's outskirts,
found some ashes, bones, and pottery.
shards embedded in a newly cut gulch.
From their position under 80 feet of
gravel and stones deposited by glaciers,
Bingham concluded that the presum-
ably human bones must have been at
least ·30,000 years old. "You can easily
im·agine," he wrote to his wife with
glee, "how pleased I am to have actual-
ly discovered the bones myself"
(A second Yale expedition to the
area in 1912, however, discovered to
Bingham's chagrin that the "Cuzco
bones" resembled the remains of cattle
slaughtered in Cuzco meat markets.)

This eventual disappointment, of
course, was still unknown to Bingham
in 1911, as he gathered the last of his
mules and supplies for the trek into old
Inca territory. Flushed with the excite-
ment of his first major "discovery,"
Bingham left Cuzco on July 19, 1911.
He had decided to split up the expedi-
tion into three parties that would strike
north into Vileabamba first, along the
Urubamba River, before tackling the
southern route along the 73rd
Meridian to Mt. Corupuna. While his
companions took on the cartographic
responsibilites of the expedition,
Bingham and Foote would take the
more exciting journey: the exploration

with some of their surveying equip-
ment. Both Hendricksen and Foote
recounted this incident with great con-
cern in their journals, but Bingham,
oddly, did not mention it at all.

On July 23, 1911, Bingham
reached Mandor Pampa, where
Melchor Arteaga offered Bingham the
same invitation he had extended to
Albert Giesecke months before--to see
ruins high up above the river, beside a
mountain named Huayna Picchu, on a
ridge Arteaga called "Machu Picchu."

The next morning dawned cold
and damp, as a light drizzle came down
from the skies above the Urubamba
canyon to wet the heads of Bingham
and his crew. Arteaga, "an Indian
rather better than average" as Bingham
put it, seemed less enthusiastic about
taking his guests up the ridge in the
rain. A pledge of a silver dollar for his
pains convinced Arteaga to lead
Bingham and Carrasco up to the ruins.
Bingham's companions elected to
remain behind.

The three men walked along a
road for about 45 minutes, before
heading through the undergrowth to
the edge of the Urubamba River to a
perilously narrow log bridge that was
the only way to cross the rapids.
Having forded the river, they began to
climb a steep incline up to the top of
the ridge that rose above the
Urubamba. After an hour-and-a-half,
