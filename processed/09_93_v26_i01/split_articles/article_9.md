EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Like the "discoverers" of Machu Picchu, we at The New Journal consider ourselves explorers. But unlike Hiram Bingham and his team, our summertime explorations always begin and end at home. This summer we took our commitment to traversing the homefront quite literally, visiting the domestic confines of four married undergraduates. Summertime also gave us the opportunity to wander beyond our Gothic walls and our city limits. Out there we met two Yale grads who have made careers writing Hollywood sitcoms.

In this issue, we renew our commitment to mapping the changes in the university administration. One year ago, The New Journal featured stories on outgoing president Benno Schmidt and interim president Howard Lamar. This year, with our third administration in as many years, we offer two perspectives on the uphill climb: an examination of the duties of the university president and Richard Brodhead's own, straight-from-the-source reflections on becoming Dean of Yale College.

At The New Journal, though, exploration is not merely a summertime pursuit. We look forward to the coming year's discoveries and invite you to join us in making them. The trek begins at our organizational meetings: Monday, September 6, at 7:30 PM in the Silliman Common Room and Wednesday, September 8, at 7:00 PM at St. Anthony Hall, 438 College Street (Corner of College and Wall Streets). Whatever your talent may be-business, photography, design, artwork, computers, or writing-there's a place for you on our expedition.
