has the complicated task of keeping 
the university focused on this principal 
mission and of facilitating its accom-
plishment through securing funds, set-

Pelikan suggested President Levin faces an array of challenges 
· 
"More deci-

made at lower

antidote. as he assumes his new post. 
"Presidents need 
to set aside a period of four hours 
every so often and read and reflect on 
Aristotle," he said, breaking int·o a 
Cheshire Cat grin. "If not, they will 
quickly get stifled with sclerosis of the 
mind." 

However, Dartmouth President 
James Freedman wonders if any reju-
venation methods are sufficient. "The 
constant pressure of events, the lack of 
privacy, the lack of free time, the 
number of constituencies, and the 
general intensiry of the job tends to 
rub presidents raw," he explained. 
"What is frightening is how much I 
draw primarily on the intellectual cap-
ital I'd deposited in the past, before I 
assumed this job." 

Although a recent report of a 
committee appointed to study Yale's 
governance system proposed only 
that I run, I have more help than the 
president of Yale." 

To grease the decision-making 
gears, some suggest appointing a Dean 
of Arts and Sciences. At Harvard, the 
Dean of Arts and Sciences is one of a 
layer of deans inserted between the 
president and faculty, making the 
overall system more decentralized 
than Yale's. Former Harvard Dean 
Rosovsky contrasted the roles of presi-
dent and dean in the Harvard system. 
"A president views the university from 
an Olympian perspective," he wrote. 
"He stands on the shoulders of the 
deans peering into the distance, think-
ing of new challenges in spans of 
years ... I see myself as a field comman-
der, ducking bullets from unexpected 
directions." 

Levin contends that something is

lost when the dichotomy between 
field commander and Olympian 
becomes too distinct. "At Harvard," 
he said, "there is no sense of center. 
The president is out of the loop, up in 
the ephemeral heights without a lot of 
contact down in the classrooms and 
faculty meetings. Being tied into 
undergraduate life lends vitality." But 
it is this struggle to maintain a dual 
perspective-a balance between 
thinking from a short-term versus a 
long-term perspective-
that consis-
tently proves a challenge to even the 
most talented Yale presidents. 

While inserting more layers of 
bureaucracy jnto a university adminis-
tration may be more efficient, it 
diminishes open access to the presi-
dent. Elevating to power a new level 
of bureaucrats potentially threatens 
the power of those presently close to 
the president, especially the graduate 
school deans. Former Dean ofTufts 
University School of Medicine Henry 
Banks explains, "From the deans' 
point of view, it is far preferable to go 
directly to the president, rather than 
through ~ complicated maze of 
administrative hierarchy." 

But to"characterize Yale as a cen-
tralized university in need of decen-
tralization is to overlook the nuances 
ofYale's governance system. Compare, 
for instance, Harvard's and Yale's fac-
ulty management and hiring practices. 
The president of Harvard is intimately 
involved in the mechanics of tenuring 
faculty members, playing an involved 
role in all ad hoc review committees, 
while the president ofYale contributes 
not much more besides an official 
sign-off power. 

But Yale faculty members love 
their departmental and individual 
autonomy. "One of the very satisfying 
things here is that the senior faculty 
have the feeling that they are self-
managers as well as teachers," said for-
mer Dean of Yale College Georges 
May. "This perception of participa-
tion is very precious. It gives us soli-
SEPTEMBER 3· 1993 
clarity with the institution." 

Yale's system is centralized only in 
that responsibility for all administra-
tive decisions ultimately rests with the 
President himself; therefore, all eyes 
watch his actions and all voices try to 
appeal to him. While this perception 
of power remains centralized in the 
'office of the president, that power has 
actually been diluted among many 
other positions. Pelikan views Yale's 
administration as neither a centralized 
nor a decentralized system, but rather 
as an integral one attempting to 
involve as broad a range of constituen-
cies as possible. 

T
he convoluted centralization-
versus-decentralization argu-
ment can be unraveled only by 
delving into the yore of old Yale. The 
epitome of a "strong presidency" 
involved in all aspects of university life 
goes back to Reverend Thomas Clap's 
administration. Originating the title 
"President," Clap led the university in 
the mid-eighteenth century. He per-
suaded the trustees to accept his 
sweeping language that drastically 
increased the university leader's pow-
ers: 

The Executive Power of the 
College is principally in the 
President, who hath the 
power to govern the College 
and every student thereo£ 

Ruling the campus with an iron fist, 
Clap was reluctant even to consider 
student grievance petitions. 

Clap's authoritarianism, though, 
was largely a response to his predeces-
sors' lack of power .. The original uni-
versity founders stipulated that the 
university leader, called the rector, 
should be responsible only for 
" instru~ting and ordering the School." 
Everything else remained the province 
of the trustees. So circumscribed were 
the rector's duties that Reverend 
Samuel Andrew, the second to hold
