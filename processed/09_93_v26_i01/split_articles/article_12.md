orty years ago, the Yale Corporation was considering 
A. Whitney Griswold ('29) as a candidate for the uni-
versity presidency. During the heated debate, 
Corporation Fellow Wilmarth S. Lewis describe d the ideal 
qualifications for the university's leader: 

Yale's next president must first of all be a Yale man 
and a great scholar-also a social philosopher who 
has at his finger tips a solution of all world prob-
lems ... He must be a man of iron health and stami-
na, a young man-but also mature and full of wis-
dom ... As I have been talking, you have, I don't 
doubt, realized that there is only One who has 
most of these qualifications. But there is a question 
even about Him-Is God a Yale man? 

The standards were just as exacting during the 1992-93 
presidential search. Only time will tell whether Yale's new 
president, Richard Levin, proves equal to the challenges of 
presiding over this institution. Many speculate that the rig-
ors, obstacles, and demands of the job itself defy any mortal 
to surmount them. Presiding over 11 graduate schools and 
Yale College, 6,000 employees, 11 ,000 students, a $2.6 bil-
lion endowment, 225 buildings, and 13,000 acres, 
President Levin (GRD '74) undertakes a job defined by 
high expectations and much stress, at a time when the aver-
age university president endures only five years in the job. 


ormer Yale President A. Bartlett Giamatti (SY '60) 
once characterized his job as similar to that of a monk 
cloistered in a monastery facing 21st-century prob-
lems. Imagine a neighborhood association leader, a graduate 
student union organizer, a wealthy alumna, and a wizened 
professor all waiting expectantly outside a university presi-
dent's office for emergency appointments. When the p resi-
dent peeks outside into the reception room, a torrent of 
complaints and concerns besiege him. To whom does he 
respond first? 


Few of the voices clamoring for the president's ear are 
aware that they are just one voice among many. During his 
days as an undergraduate campus leader, Baltimore Mayor 
Kurt Schmoke (DC '71) recalls deliberating with then-
President Kingman Brewster about a proposed child day 
care center for university staff. From his current perspective 
as a Corporation member,Schmoke reflects, "We only 
thought of the need to provide child care, not whether it 
could be used as a potential subject of labor negotiation. 
Since we weren't asking for lots of money, we didn't under-
stand that Brewster had to consider what impact this would 
have on the collective bargaining power of the entire uni-
versity." 

"Power is essentially -a fiction, to 
which everyone subscribes. A nd if it is 
ascribed to you, even if you don 't 
have it, you do have it, 'said former 
President Giamatti. 


Trouble precipitates when groups feel their interests are 
even slightly threatened. Always anticipating a brewing 
controversy, presidents expend their efforts nursing the 
fragile egos of various segments of their communities. Each 
of these constituencies finds its way into the president's 
office only on specific occasions to address particular con-
cerns, which rarely involve sustained direct interaction. As a 
result, university presidents spend much of their work time 
reacting to the issues raised by this stream of supplicants 
that flows daily in and out of his office. "A friend called me 
to convey that he liked his new job as a university president, 
except for the interruptions," History professor Jaroslav 
Pelikan related. "He called back a few months later and said 
he had realized that the interruptions are the job." 


Nostalgic for the glory days of collegiate youth, alumni 
would seem a university president's most vociferous sup-
porters. "Yale graduates want to love Yale and are eager to 
accept a new president," said Eustace Theodore (PC '63), 
Executive Director of the Association of Yale Alumni. "But 
in exchange for their support they desire to talk to the per-
son in control of the university to assure themselves of who 
he is, as well as to feel a sense of participation. in shaping the 
university." But whenever change threatens sacred tradi-
tions, many alumni cling to their visions of old Yale. 


President Brewster used to liken his alumni visits to 
American soldiers' attempts at rural pacification in 
Vietnam. Everywhere he went, Yale graduates criticized his 
actions, especially co-education. 


If finding a balance between conflicting wants of past 
and present Yalies seems only mildly d ifficult, add to it 
mediating a temperamental faculty. Tenured faculty are the-
oretically responsible only to their department chairs and 
the president; in practice, many of them believe their status 
bestows upon them immunity from any sort of authority. 
Yale educators would agree that at no major university are 
the tenured faculty more powerful than at Yale. Pelikan 
described the typical attitude of Yale's faculty in The Idea of 
the University: A Reexamination. "The chief executive officer 
of a university," he quotes from a former university presi-
dent, "is the conductor in an orchestra made up entirely of 
composers." 


Unlike students, who spend a relatively short time on 
campus, faculyr members have an enduring interest in every 
nuance of presidential policy-making. "Faculty members 
have long and rather unforgiving memories; eventually they 
will get even," former Harvard Dean of Arts and Sciences 
and one-time candidate for the Yale Presidency Henry 
Rosovsky wrote in The University: An Owner's ManuaL "If 
you notice a lack of cooperation, recall that eight years ago 
you-quite reasonably-turned down this person's request 
for better parking or additional leave with pay." 


While students, alumni, and faculty choose, to some 
extent, to affiliate with Yale, residents of the city of New 
Haven maintain an ambiguous-and at times antagonis-
tic-relationship with the university and its president. For 
all those outside the Yale family, the president of the univer-
sity personifies Yale. The president's actions betray the 
aggregate attitudes of the university. Recognizing his influ-
ence in the sensitive town-gown relationship, Levin said, 
"We must take the issue of our environment very seriously. 
It is imperative that New Haven be an attractive area for 
students and faculty. But," he continued, "at the same time 
as we focus on the immediate area around the campus, Yale, 
with its network of connections, can be equally helpful to 
the entire city by finding resources, generating attention, 

and playing a national policy role." 


But State Representative Bill Dyson ('D-94) doubts 
Yale's commitment to the city. Addressing a group of Yale 
sophomores, he said, "Yale's mission is not the town; it is 
you and your parents. To accommodate you, Yale tolerates 
the town; but it would squash anybody it can to maintain 1 
its place as a world-class institution." 


f these high expectations and insistent demands 
on a Yale president from various constituents belie 
he extent of the actual powers he or she can employ 
in response. "The small operational decisions so far have 
often been rather gratifying," said Levin. "Dean [Richard] 
Brodhead brought to my attention that over 400 beds on 
Old Campus have broken pull-out drawers. I had the power 
to say, 'OK, let's fix them.' It wasn't a huge investment, but 
it will make a significant difference in people's initial 
impressions ofYale." 


The president's direct power, however, to say "OK, let's 
do it" generally proves limited. In every area another admin-
istrator plays point position. The provost is the chief aca-
demic officer, and the Vice President for Finance and 
Administration assumes primary responsibility over finan-
cial matters. The Corporation approves every major 
university decision. Deans preside over day-to-day 
matters in student life, and the tenured faculty 
reign over their own academic matters while 
being involved in other aspects of the uni-
versity. The president can only appoint-
and trust that his or her university offi-
cers will competently execute their 
tasks. 


Lacking direct influence 
over day-to-day affairs, the 
Yale president must ful-
fill a broader task.

Giamatti, we're 
here to pre-
serve,
