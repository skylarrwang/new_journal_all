EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
In early May I was asked if I would write some thoughts for publication in Th~ N~w journaL For several reasons I was pleased to agree. The editor who asked was a former student; I have a long-standing admiration for this journal, which was founded by friends of mine in undergraduate years; and the terms of the request were exceptionally easy-my piece could be on any subject, and I'd have the whole summer to write it. 


The whole summer having flown by, packed with days when I could have written my piece if only it had seemed a little more urgent, I now find myself face to face with my task and learn that it is an abyss of vagueness. I've seldom found it hard to write on something; but on "Anything?" That's a taller order, and it takes me back to the misery-inducing "free theme" of my youth, that open-ended invitation to expose the barrenness of one's imagination. 


The default topic in those (I hope) long gone days was "how I spent my summer," which might avail me here. For how I spent my summer was learning a new territory and giving some reflection to the kind of job I've undertaken. So a topic presents itself after all: Preliminary Reflection of Administration Man. 


One thing that has come clear to me is how many years one can spend in a university without paying any attention to its administration. When I was an undergraduate the Dean of Yale College was Georges May. Though my classmates and I could easily pick up on the fact that Dean May was the most urbane person one had ever met (he still is), his face atwinkle with an extraordinary knowingness mysteriously compatible with endless amusement, I did not know three things about what the Dean of Yale College was or did. There had to be one, it seemed, and there my curiosity ended. 


When I was in graduate school, during the student revolution of 1970, I, of course, learned the general mistrust of administrations rigueur in that extraordinary season, and protested such callous displays of administrative power as the tree removals necessary to build the Cross Campus Library. But I still had no idea what administration meant in any concrete sense, and my ignorance persisted long after I joined the faculty. 


I speak now from a position of somewhat greater knowledge. From this position I judge that my earlier ignorance represented not a real deficiency but a sign that things were working fairly well. For I now suppose that the deep aim of university administration is in some serious sense to make itself disappear: that its real goal is to make it possible for most people most of the time to think about other things. 


My late colleague, Michael Cooke, tragically killed this time of year three years ago, said to me shortly after he took up the Mastership of Trumbull College: "You know, Dick, all teaching properly culminates in administration." Michael Cooke was given to oracular utterances, and I remember at the time feeling that this statement was no less profound for being wholly enigmatic. Much later in my own career, I know both what he meant and why I would disagree with him. He meant, I suppose, that the same moral passions that make teaching such a satisfying career for some people, are what drive such people into the institutional labors that support education. That, I think, is undeniable: I can't imagine the psyche so malformed that it could desire administrative position as an end rather than as a means to serve other ends. But surely the educative will doesn't lead toward administrative culminations in any inevitable or necessary way; quite the reverse. 


Yale has distinguished tradition of scholar teachers who have come to administrative power on the basis of their work as educators, not bureaucrats. My other colleague, A. Bartlett Giamatti, also painfully remembered at this time of year, is the great modern exemplum of this type. Yale remains highly distinctive for its refusal to tolerate the separation of administrative from academic personnel. What was once said of men and dust can largely be said of Yale administrators: of the faculty they are, and to the faculty they shall return. Nevertheless, the faculty-administrator tradition can conceal the fact that the great majority of faculty do not, do not want to, do not need to, turn away from educational to administrative roles. We do that work when it comes to us, but we are not here for that. 


What is administration? My own understanding of this form of work relies on something like a base/superstructure model. I visualize universities as comprising two zones of activity that are at once profoundly different and separate and profoundly interdependent on one another. In one of these, the activities that are the purpose of the university take place: study, reflection, discussion, the transmission of knowledge and the interrogation of received ideas, and the building of bonds between people from different backgrounds who are engaged in these common pursuits. (This formulation is of course very approximate.) These activities are in essence intellectual, one might even say ideal. But it is their peculiarity that they require support from another sphere of activity that is the reverse of ideal: practical, bureaucratic, material or physical, economic. So a course is, in its moments of intense self-realization, a wholly intellectual transaction, a vivid sharing and questioning of knowledge performed together by teacher and student. But in another, just-as-real sense, a course is the set of not-in-the-least intellectual arrangements that made this intellectual experience possible: it meets at an hour that has to be arranged, in a location that has to be arranged, in a building whose physical maintenance has to be arranged, led by an instructor who has to be hired, whose qualifications have to be approved, whose parking space has to be arranged, whose benefits and salary have to be arranged, working with students who have to be selectively admitted according to policies and procedures that have to be arranged, who themselves require study space, and residential space, and dining hall menus, all of which require to be arranged, and ... you get the idea. 


The educational operations of a university are not reducible to its bureaucratic arrangements, but they can't take place separate from those arrangements: those arrangements create the possibility of an experience of a different order, an experience free to forget the arrangements that provided its occasion-what is called the life of the mind. This, I take it, is what administration is in a university: a temporary crossing over from the realm of education proper into the enabling realm of arrangement. 


It follows that good administration isn't just the art of skillful management, but is that practice of management that retains a powerful sense of what it is trying to enable, what non-practical goal it is trying to ad-minister or minister to. (My Latin dictionary gives these senses for the noun administer, administri: servant, underling, assistant, agent, attendant, priest.) 


All of which is true enough, but fails to capture the drama that can attach to administration. This arises from the fact that arrangement and management require choices, choices to be made in the midst of competing communal preferences and with finite resources for their realization. A stupid joke of my youth ran: "Would you like to go to California or by bus?" But just this absurd asymmetry characterizes the kinds of choices that come up in the zone of administration. Would you rather subscribe to obscure periodicals for the library-since who knows what apparently minor periodical in what apparently marginal language will turn out to be considered a major cultural document?-or put a roof on a severely leaky lab? Would you rather paint the admissions office-an educational issue, since appearances can affect matriculation and Yale wants to draw the best--or hire extra teaching assistants for an overcrowded course?
