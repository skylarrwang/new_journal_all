"high caliber" students than does New Haven's. Retiring 
Alderman Mike Morand (0-1) points out that "too few aca-
demic superstars" graduate from the New Haven school sys-
tem. "The number of students [from New Haven) who 
apply to competitive four-year colleges is extremely small," 
he says. "If people complain that Yale should let in more 
New Haven kids, well, the fact is that Yale probably couldn't 
admit more even if it wanted." 


Many agree that the key to increasing the number of 
New Havenites at ·Yale is not special scholarships and the 
quotas that they create. Educators and students alike prefer 
college preparation programs and heavy recruitment drives 
to help make Yale more accessible to New Haven students. 
Morand feels that Yale can help New Haven students to be 
better prepared for college. "New Haven SAT scores are very 
low," he comments. The average SAT score in the New 
Haven school district in 1991-92 was 327 Verbal, 367 Math, 
compared to the state average of 422 Verbal, 463 Math. 
Morand cites the SAT prep program started by law student 
Peter Gunn as a good example of what Yale can do to help 
prepare New Haven students for college. Hillhouse's Saxon 
praises Yale's student-run Branch tutoring program and the 
New Haven-Yale Teacher's Institute-a program in which 
Yale professors and New Haven teachers work together to 
develop high school curricula-as projects through which 
Yale has had P?sitive effects on the New Haven educational 
system. 


Some have suggested that Yale upgrade its recruiting 
efforts to attract the relatively small number of academic 
superstars that do graduate from New Haven high schools. 
Many feel that ,¥ale needs to tear down some of the obsta-
cles, real or perceived, that may discourage New Havenites 
from applying to and attending Yale. 


One problem, though, is simply geographic. "Kids want 
to leave town," says Director of Undergraduate Admissions 
Richard Shaw. Wagner admits that it is "difficult to go to 
school five minutes from your house." She knows students 
who could have gone to Yale, but chose schools like Stanford 
and Brown instead, just to leave the New Haven area. 


A more disturbing factor, however, is the perceived class 
and racial gap between Yale and New Haven. "Some stu-
dents are actually discouraged by their parents from applying 
to Yale," says Saxon. "Yale is seen as an elitist place for 
wealthy whites." Other students may also dissuade potential 
applicants. "'Don't go to Yale,' these kids will say, 'It'll turn 
you into a whjte person."' 


Yale's academic reputation may also discourage New 
Haven students from applying. There is a perception among 
some New Haven public school students that their high 
school education is inadequate preparation for Yale. "I 
always questioned how good my high school education 
Was--it loomed over me," says Wagner. "We didn't always 
have all the resources we needed. I once got a high school 
physics textbook a month after the course started." 


Students feel that aggressive recruitment drives could 
dispel many of the myths that scare away qualified students. 
Both Wagner and Cordero advocate sending current Yale 
students from New Haven back to their schools to bridge 
some of the "perception gaps." "People like me can be a big 
influence," says Cordero. Former New Haven students came 
to recruit at his high school when Cordero was a sophomore, 
and the visit helped to encourage him to apply to and come 
to Yale. ''I'd like to see more of that," he says. "People can 
relate to people from their own neighborhood and ethnic 
background." 


Yale already has a number of programs in place that have 
helped make its resources more available to New Haven stu-
dents. Both Cordero and Wagner attended Yale's New 
Haven and Area High School Program, which invites talent-
ed area high school students to attend classes at Yale free of 
charge. "I could do the work, I liked the professors, and the 
students were interesting," remembers Cordero, who took a 
conversational Spanish course as a high school junior, and 
attended Yale's Shafer Summer Scholarship program. This 
program allows students who have finished their junior year 
to take courses for eight weeks and receive college credit. 
Full financial aid is provided by the Shafer Family 
Scholarship, which was established primarily to help minori-
ty students from the New Haven area. Wagner and Cordero 
cite teachers and guidance counselors as the key people in 
identifying potential candidates for these programs and for 
future application to Yale. These faculty members provide 
the link between the university and high school students. 


Yale's special programs seem to have brought the univer-
siry closer to some New Haven students. "Students who 
come and apply to Yale usually have a previous connection 
to Yale," says Morand. "They've realized that Yale is accessi-
ble and has fabulous resources. It's not a cold, stone palace." 


To too many New Haven students, though, the cold, stone 
walls are still forbidding.
