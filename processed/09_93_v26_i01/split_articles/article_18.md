Speaking of New Haven in the past tense comes easily. 

One has enly to look beyond a four block radius sur-
rounding Yale to see neighborhoods gripped by pover-
ty and divided along ethnic lines. Yet there still are two 
things that can pull people of the area together, remind 
them of their shared history, and provide some economic 
stability in a city hit hard by the current recession: the quest 
for the perfect pizza and the historic hamburger. 

Oddly enough, New Haven takes credit for creating 
the weight of rising insurance rates, high 
taxes, 
and 
a 
crippling 
recession.

place where different 
ethnic and socio-
economic groups 
mingle peacefully. 
'People don't come 
here to argue. They 
come here to eat. '
these twin pillars of American cuisine and 
culture. Viewed in the context of the histo-
ry of these products, these inventions are of 
considerable importance. Hamburg~rs have 
become standard American fare, spawning 
such corporate giants as McDonald's and 
Burger King. The slice of American-style 
pizza is a sidewalk fixture from New York to 
Moscow. 
Moscow is a long way from Wooster 
Street in New Haven, but Flora Consiglio, 
proprietor of the famous Sally's Pizzeria of 
Wooster Street, can remember when 
Wooster St~et was the only place you could 
get pizza. Her late husband Salvatore (hence 
the name Sally's) began working in his 
uncle's pizzeria, Pepe's, down the block while 
still in grammar school. In 1938 he started his own restau-
rant and people have been lining up to get a table ever since, 
including the likes of Senator Edward Kennedy, Frank 
Sinatra, Gary Trudeau, and Michael Bolton. All three of 
Consiglio's children have returned after graduating from 
college to help run the restaurant. 

What then makes Sally's pizza a step above the competi-
tion? Consiglio, mother of three and grandmother of four, 
smiled demurely. "In all honesty, I couldn't tell you what 
the difference is." She did emphasize, however; the impor-
tance of using pizza dough over bread dough-a distinction 
many pizzerias overlook. 

Waiting in line in the late afternoon summer heat, 
Gregory Williams and his fiancee, Rhonda Myers, had their 
own theories. "I think I've cracked their recipe," Williams, a 
cook at Trumbull College, asserted. "Sally's uses really fresh 
ingredients like virgin olive oil, fresh garlic, and tomato 
sauce where you can see the skins of the tomatoes. Pepe's 
uses more crushed, pureed tomatoes in their sauce. Only 
problem is you can't reheat Sally's pizza." 
Myers, who works at Yale-New Haven Hospital and 
University Commons, nodded her assent. "Modern 
[Apizza] is similar to Sally's. But after I got hooked on this, 
I won't eat any other pizza." 

Sally's importance to this city transcends simply pro-
viding the finest pizza to New Haven's residents. Small, 
family-run businesses like Sally's, in Consiglio's opinion, 
provide the economic backbone of a city struggling under 
Unfortunately, these self-same family busi-
nesses are becoming. rarer. "I. mean years 
ago we had many lnde spectalty stores. 
They used to have a policemanÂ· on every 
street corner to direct traffic during the 
Christmas shopping season," she said. 
"New Haven was a great place, believe 
me. " 

One reason for Sally's longevity as a 
business enterprise lies in its reliance on a 
small 
profit 
margin-high 
volume 
approach. "You have to work harder but at 
least you're making a living wage," 
Consiglio said. She explained that her 
husband had a simple rule to guide his 
business: "If you won't eat it, don't serve it." 

Sally's also functions as a place where different ethnic 
and socio-economic groups mingle peacefully. Back outside 
in the line to get in, Sue and Dominic, a middle-aged cou-
ple from the predominantly Italian suburban community of 
East 
Haven, 
stood 
behind 
Williams, who is black and hails 
from the Hill, one of New Haven's 
poorest and most violent areas. 

Couples like Sue and Dominic 
and Gregory and Rhonda find 
themselves waiting less and less on 
the same lines, having fewer 
chances to 
meet and 
talk. 

Fortunately a good pizza can still 
bring people together. Consiglio recalled a couple who met 
waiting outside the restaurant and ended having their wed-
ding rehearsal dinner at the pizzeria. "People don't come 
here to argue," Williams said. "They come here to eat."
