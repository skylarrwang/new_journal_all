MAINE EVENT 
The political universes ofYale Universi-
ty and the state of Maine may, to the casual 
observer, seem more or less unrelated. That 
is, until a referendum for legalizing same-
sex marriage appeared on the Pine Tree 
State's ballot this October. In response to 
the news, the Yale Women's Center began 
a flurry of activity around campus urging 
students to help phone bank for marriage 
equality in hopes of influencing Maine 
voters when election time came. What 
was unclear, however, was how the orga-
nization intended to justify the legitimacy 
of their involvement in an out-of-state 
election. There are only 32 students from 
Maine at Yale, and Connecticut students 
cannot register in another state. A Maine 
native myself, I felt odd getting involved, 
unsure of how Yale students could appro-
priately enter my home state's politics. Do 
non-Mainers have the right to try and in-
fluence the voting choices of Maine citi-
zens? 


On the American political battle-
ground, Maine is usually overlooked. 
Nationally, its two electoral votes cause 
little uproar, especially since its citizens are 
able to divide them as they choose. The 
state's policies traditionally focus on taxes 
and education. But, as a state of older and 
98o/o white citizens, it tends to lean right 
on social issues, most noticeably in areas 
of "traditional values" like marriage. 
So 
when the Maine Legislature passed the 
Marriage Equality Act in May granting 
marriage rights to same-sex couples, many 
of the state's citizens balked. Conservative 
Mainers called in Californian petitioners, 
many of whom had been active supporters 
of Prop 8 in their home state, to overturn 
the bill. As a referendum state, Maine citi-
zens have a fixed period of a time after a 
bill is enacted to collect 58,000 signatures 
and push the issue to the November ballot. 
With the help of the out-of-state petition-
ers, the Marriage Equality bill went into a 
referendum, leaving its fate in the hands 
of Maine's divided citizenry. Just four days 
before the vote, the polls were exactly di-
vided at 48o/o yes and 48o/o no. 


In an effort to improve turnout, mo-
tivated Yalies began ca IIi ng thousands of 
registered Maine voters on a weekly basis. 
With the slogan "Yale for Maine Equality," 
some students even made the four-hour 
trek to Maine to go door-to-door and 
speak with voters directly about the issue. · 
In the weeks before the election students 
made over 1200 calls, and campaigners re-
turned from Maine feeling that they had 
truly made a difference in the prospective 
voting turnout. "I think, at the very least, 
if we didn't change any minds, we human-
ized the issue for a lot of people," said one 
canvasser. 


Despite the admirable intentions of the 
Yale students involved, I began to fear the 
effects of their actions. I myself was so di-
vided on the issue that I didn't even feel 
comfortable joining the phone bank. And 
if I didn't feel comfortable, how would 
conservative Mainers react to phone calls 
from liberal Yalies telling them how to 
vote? Would even moderate voters feel that 
their local politics were being undermined 
by the rest of the nation? 


Other Mainers seemed to share these 
concerns. Alan, a 44-year-old mill manag-
er in Waterville, Maine said, "If it's a state 
issue, it's people in the state that should be 
involved in the issue, not people from out 
of state. I decide on my own politics, so 
someone calling me and trying to convince 
me otherwise is just not effective." The 
older generation of Mainers seemed even 
more adamantly against outside involve-
ment from anyone on any issue. Gerry, a 
72-year-old retiree says he doesn't appreci-
ate political _calls of any kind, whether the 
agenda is marriage or road repair. "When 
the phone rings during election time," he 
says, "I don't even answer." 


Even Mainers who appreciated the 
Yalies' efforts questioned their effective-
ness. Laura, a 43-year-old math teacher in 
Fairfield, ME is torn on the issue. "When 
it comes to equality, it can't just be a state 
issue," she says. "But, outside involvement 
could be dangerous by turning Mainers 
away [from the polls]." Tao Mason (YC 
'13), a Maine native, shares similar senti- . 
ments. "I wouldn't be swayed by a phone 
call," he says, "but maybe they will con-
vince someone, and I think they could be 
satisfied with the small progress of making 
one person think harder about the issue." 


So was the presence of outside pan.ies-
including Yale 
detrimental to Maine's 
fight for equality? We'll never really know. 
But regardless of the strides made by the 
Yale petitioners, Maine and the coun-
try alike suffered a loss on the civil rights 
front in the early morning hours of No-
vember 4th when, with 86o/o of precincts 
reporting, voters repealed Maine Marriage 
Equality Act, 53°/o Yes to 47o/o No. 


Before I packed up for my freshman 
year at Yale, more than one person said to 
me, "You bring those people some good 
Maine conservative sense, you hear?" 


From the start, it was strikingly dear that 
many Mainers see Yale as a major epicenter 
of radical left-wing craziness. But maybe 
Maine and Yale are · closer than either 
would admit, if not with respect to poli-
tics but with respect to political practice. 
What matters to the Mainers who called in 
conservative· Californians to push the bill 
to referendum. and the Yalies who trekked 
400 miles up north is not a question of 
state rights. Rather, it is the conviction 
that some issues transcend state borders.
