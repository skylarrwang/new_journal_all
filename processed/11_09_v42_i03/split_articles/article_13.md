of the writer C.S. Lewis, who infused his 
' narratives with Christian overtones. 

Hans Anderson (YC '10), editor-in-
chief of Yale's Christian journal Logos, 
echoes Shelton's sentiments. Founded 
in 2007, Logos seeks to serve the Chris-
tian community first, but· Anderson as-
serts that Logos' audience consists of all 
"thoughtful, interested people," Chris-
tian and non-Christian alike. Still, the 
faith-based and intellectual aspects of 
such a forum cannot be easily teased 
apart. 

With figures like St. Augustine and 
Thomas Aquinas, Christianity has a ro-
bust history · of intellectual debate. But 
such an incontrovertibly intellectual 
legacy is by no means exclusive to Chris-
tianity. Within the Abrahamic religions, 
Maimonides and Averroes loom as the 
towering intellectuals of Judaism and Is-
lam. Yet it is the particularly Christian 
tradition of "bearing witness" to faith 
that seems to motivate exegesis and re-
flection. 

Therein lies what Professor Ganssle 
sees as an enduring misunderstanding of 
what it means to be religious. As Ganssle 
phrases it, "It's the difference between 
'believing that' and 'believing in."' Ac-
cording to Ganssle, secular students 
create a false dichotomy between radi-
cal, irrational fundamentalist belief and 
rationally "believing that" something is 
the case. However "believing in" some-
thing occupies a space between these two 
views 
by believing in something, you 
hold it both to be true and meaningful 
to you. 

The equation of belief with funda-
mentalism indicates an important prob-
lem with how we talk about religion, 
and one of the most meaningful con-
tributions of polemic organizations like 
the Veritas Forum and Logos to break 
down this equation. In Yale's multicul-
tural environment, students are used to 
interacting with people from a panoply 
of religious and ethnic backgrounds. 
But tolerance, some argue, sometimes 
misses the point of intercultural intel-
lecwal dialogue. "People are willing to 
tolerate far more than they are willing to 
understand," says Samantha Mosha (YC 
'12), an organizer of the Veritas Fomm. 
By substituting tolerance for inquiry and 
understanding, secular and religious stu-
dents unintentionally create a greater di-
November 2009 
vide between one another. 

The best thing religious students can 
do, Ganssle and Anderson agree, is to 
present their faith hon~stly and richly. 
Finding commonality with secular stu-
dents involves describing what it means 
to truly believe in something. Ganssle, 
Anderson, and Shelton agree that at least 
for Christians, this is ·not to protect reli-
gious students from animosity or ostra-
cism. Rather, it is to fight a subtle but 
pernicious misunderstanding of what it 
means to be a person of faith. Ms. Mo-
sha notes that she has only met three or 
four secular students in her time at Yale 
who have been sincerely interested in 
questions of faith and belief. It's in the 
interests of both parties 
and the goal 
of Logos and the Veritas Forum 
to raise 
that number.
