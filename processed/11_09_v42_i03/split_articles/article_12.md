FLUX ET VERITAS 
In 1951, William F. Buckley accused 
Yale University of training a new genera-
tion of atheists. To many, Buckley's po-
lemic against academic secularism might 
seem paranoid. But today, it is a challenge 
to find discussions of faith in a setting 
beyond the Divinity School, and it is an 
equal challenge to imagine the university 
any other way. "Religious students expect 
to be challenged here," says Greg Ganssle, 
a professor of philosophy at Yale. But rath-
er than adopt the pan.isan stance of Buck-
ley, many students of faith today choose 
to engage their peers on a discursive level, 
not merely advocating for the union of the 
intellecmal and the religious but also dem-
onstranng It. 


Enter the Veritas Forum, a Christian 
organization active at Harvard and Yale, 
and committed, in their own words, to 
exploring the "original understanding of 
'veritas' ," a word that appears in the mot-
tos of the nation's two leading universities. 
Inspired by Kelly Monroe's 1992 book, 
Finding God at Harvard: Spiritual journeys 
of 7hinking Christians, the first Veritas Fo-
rum held at Harvard that same year drew 
over 700 attendees. The Forum has since 
established over 80 chapters throughout 
the country. 


According to Nick Shelton (DIV '10), 
the organizer of this year's Veritas Forum 
at Yale, religious students have to shoulder 
the responsibility of campus discussions, 
moving from trite questions about religion 
and science to more profound philosophi-
cal queries. Not only would these deeper 
discussions give religion more intellectual 
credence, they would also advance the goal 
of the university to improve the life of the 
mind. "We want to target people who are 
intimidated by religion but are interested 
in intellec;tual ideas," says Shelton. With 
this mission in mind, the Veritas Forum 
invites students to discuss questions of 
life's meaning in a more casual· manner 
than the colleges' humanities depart-
ments. The 2009 Veritas Forum at Yale, 
held at the Becton Center on October 13, 
featured Dr. Jennifer Wiseman. Dr. Wise-
man, a NASA astrophysicist, spoke on 
·the intersection between religion and cos-
mology. Her talk is part of a conversation 
she feels the old science-religion divide 
misses. "Churches and Christian schools 
are sometimes heavily influenced by the 
perception that Christianity and scientific 
processes cannot mix, and that Christians 
must always have a 'defensive' stance to-
ward science." Wiseman continues, "this 
is tragic because our Christian friends can 
miss out on rejoicing in some of the won-
derful discoveries about our universe that 
reveal God's glory and creativity." Shifting 
the public perception of faith as anti-scien-
tific to one that can incorporate science as 
well is crucial for the non-religious. 


For Shelton, who studied creative writ-
ing at Mercer College in Georgia and later 
at Oxford before coming to Yale's Divinity 
School, faith isn't to be taken lightly. M-
ter graduating high school, he published 
a collection of 50 original Christian short 
stories, and he recently published a novel 
inspired by the "9/11 Truth" movement 
entitled 
Shelton 
speaks frequen~y of corruption, greed, 
and intrigue as evils in government, and 
he hopes to address them through Chris-
tianity. Shelton compares his work to that
