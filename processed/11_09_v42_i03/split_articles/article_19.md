Everyone probably thinks I am single. 
They probably think I don't have friends. 
They probably think I am lonely. In truth, 
• 
I am. I need a hug. 
It is as though I've stepped into 
the mind o a woman who lis-
tened to so rock and browsed 
bridal catalogs all day while 
eating cheese. 
. 
I get a kiss. There was Lee, standing 
proudly on my right, glowing warmth at 
the Harold's Bridal Booth. "Hi," I mur-
mured, catching her eye. "KATE!" she 
calls, pulling me towards her and kissing 
my cheek, ushering me behind the table to 
stand with her. Annete shuffies over, sur-
rounded by her daughters and sporting the 
maroon mother-of-the-bdde dress she had 
scorned a few weeks ago at the shop. She's 
excited to see me, and introduces me to 
her daughters. 
"We've got to show her to Lisa!" she 
says, rushing ·me out of the Expo Room 
towards the dressing rooms out front, 
where three "brides" sit waiting on a plush 
bench. 

One is full figured and blonde, with 
heavy mascara that makes her eye5, in the 
language of makeup, "pop." Her ample 
breasts, tucked tightly in the corset of her 
gown, follow suit. Her two companions are 
taller and more simply arrayed, their faces 
less painted, their hair not quite so stiff 
with spray. One is a redhead and maybe 
thirty-five, and the other is younger, with 
light brown locks. The three sit cramped 
and poofing on a plush little bench meant 
for two. 
Pa5sing the three, Anette, her daughters 
and I walk to the closet where the brides 
had been dressed, where Lisa herself is cur-
rently dressing up two school-aged girlets 
in puffy white. 
· 
"Look!" Annette announces, pointing 
to me. Lisa's excited to say hello, and the 
little girls stare. 

Back in the expo room, the D J start-
ed up "I Will Always Love You" and the 
Emcee announced that it was time for the 
show to begin. The ladies of Harold's were 
lined up, and in three sets of dress chang-
es, they made their way down the catwalk. 
At first, they seemed nervous. Annette's 
youngest daughters, sitting crosslegged by 
the front of the stage, gave her giggling 
grins, and her older ones stood brave in 
their bridesmaids gowns, doing a little 
22 
hand-on-hip twirl at the end. 

A shorter girl, no more than four years 
old, approaches the catwalk in a little white 
strappy frock, and immediately bursts into 
tears. She ruris away to hugging arms, and 
the. show goes on. The other small girl, a 
little bit older, makes it all the way to the 
catwalk and starts to strut. The crowds eat 
it up. She shuffies shyly in her Mary Janes, 
and her hair hangs down straight. Annette 
does a second round in the mother-of-
the-bride dress, and the trio of fake brides 
display their gowns to the flash of cameras 
and the approving critique of the women 
below. The fashion show is a success. 

TWO WEEKS LATER, I'm standing with 
Lee in a $1,700 Paloma Blanca wedding 
dress. The Harold's staff has wanted to see 
me in their gowns from the beginning and, 
despite apprehensions,_ I finally say okay. 
Lee had informed me that we'd start 
with dresses I like, and then move on to 
dresses she thought I'd find a little more 
daring. She had pegged me as a low-key 
gown girl, and the first two on the rack 
were ivory silk a-lines, mild on the scale of 
froo£ .(An a-line dress consists of a fitted 
top that hugs a girl at the bellybutton and 
.hourglasses outward at the bust, as well as 
a bottom that poofs to the base of a cone,_ 
like the lower rungs of the letter "a," from 
the waist down.) Before I put on either, I 
have to step into a set of constrictive little 
lace and wire delights, created to sculpt 
my waist to hip ratio into something wor-
thy of a fertility sculpture. Properly con-
fined, I put on the Palmona Blanca Silk 
dress. Lee tells me to step on a pedestal so 
the dress can hang at its full length. The 
dress puddles out glamorously at my feet. 
The top of my very first a-line is covered 
in floral lace and embellished with small 
pearly beads. An ivory ribbon rests right 
above the hip. Lee catches me grinning. I 
catch myself grinning. Lee insists she snap 
a photo, and I pose. 

Next, I try on the San Patrick a-line, 
which also has me smiling. It's got a side-
ruched top, and it's off-white with a set of 
tiny buttons that cover up the zipper. The 
buttons are so tiny, Lee informs me, that 
they use crochet hooks to clasp them on 
the Big Day. 

The third dress isn't quite the charm. 
The thick halter top cuts me off at the 
shoulder, and the dress clings to my waist, 
hips, and upper thighs, pulling in tight at 
my knees so they're forced to touch, before 
trumpeting out for the calves. It reminds 
me of a "Chinese Finger trap," the little 
tube toys that-suck tighter and tighter the 
more you try to escape. Curve after copi-
ous curve, the gown is fit for an octopus 
queen, but not for me. 

My final dress is fit for a Victorian prin-
cess, and I don't mind one bit. Before I can 
put on the dress, I've got to change slips; 
I transfer into a set of hoops that pop out 
wide enough to hide at least one Great 
Dane, and Lee buttons me up in the dress. 
It's a gentle, coral pink-white, decked 
in rivulets of silver jewels, and blossom-
ing out from the thin strapped top into a 
willow tree's graceful dome. Lee tops me 
with a tiara and plays with my hair until 
the little crown stands up on its own. I'd 
never wear it in real life, but the women of 
Harold's don't care. They just want me to 
feel beautiful. 

HAROLD's MAY BE made for marriage, 
but this store is a sorority. It's about wom-
en and daughters and granddaughters 
and the closest of frie'nds. Saturday is the 
busiest day at Harold's, but by 4:30 one 
weekend in October, half an hour before 
closing, the shop has quieted down, and 
just the employees and I remain. Meghan, 
Annette and Lisa's niece, is here at Harold's 
for the first time since I've started observ-
ing the shop. It's her 18th birthday. "Hey 
Lee!" Lisa calls down towards the storage 
section of the shop. "Call the girls!" Wait-
ing for the seamstresses, Annette, Lee, 
and Lisa cluster by the counter, surround-
ing Meghan. Lee munches on a block of 
cheese. Somebody brings out cake in a 
Stop & Shop plastic container. 

"I stayed up all night to make this!" An-
nette jokes. 

The women work together to top it with 
a white and green candle shaped like the 
number" 18." It has two wicks and they set 
the flame with a little white lighter. They 
wait, and soon Lisa and Connie, the two 
squat seamstresses, forty-year-vets of the 
store, waddle in. With the gang all there, 
it's finally time to blow out the candles. 

In utter un-melodic sweetness, the 
women begin to sing. The birthday song is 
stripped of all delicate harmony, and each 
member of the Harold's family is singing 
her own personal rendition just slightly 
out of sync with her neighbors. They fin-
ish, though, one by one, and Meghan, 
amongst them, stands while they clap. She 
blows out the candles and gets them all.
