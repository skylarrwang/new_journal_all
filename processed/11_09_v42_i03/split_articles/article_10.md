HOUSE OF CARDS 
Everyone loves a good card game: 
Poker, Bridge, Go Fish - you name it. All 
who play understand the basic premises 
-kings are higher than queens and each 
deck has four suits. But suppose one day 
the cards dealt a different hand: acorns 
instead of clubs, dancing jesters instead of 
jacks, floral patterns instead of the num-
bers one through ten.· At the Beinecke Li-
brary, there are hundreds and thousands of 
these cards - cards · that speak their own 
language arid make their own niles. 


The Beinecke began its acquisition of 
playing cards in 1945 when Mrs. Samuel 
Fisher donated a set of decks dating back 
to the fifteenth century. But it wasn't until 
the wife of Mel bert B. Cary YC '16 donat-
ed her husband's expansive collection after 
his death in 1967 that this card catalogue 
really_ came into its own. Throughout his 
life, Cary, an American graphic artist who 
spent his life assembling a rich spread of 
decks from all corners of the globe, showed 
an appreciation for all things quirky. In 
addition to his eccentric and eclectic 
card collection, he founded the Press of 
the Woolly Whale, a private publication 
that only printed unique and marginal-
ized texts. Cary was not concerned with 
glorifying the already famous; instead, he 
wanted to explore the underappreciated. 


Cary's passion for the peculiar is ex-
emplified in his anthology of cards: hand-
drawn Apache decks, cards designed with 
cryptic Austrian lithographs, Amos Whit-
ney Co. aces that enigmatically read, "Use 
but don't abuse me. Evil be to him that 
evil thinks." Among the Beinecke's 2,600 
decks are cards originating from 26 differ-
ent countries ·and spanning hundreds of 
years of card-making, from 16th century 
France to contemporary America. 


The cards are categorized not only by 
their geographic and .temporal origins, but 
also by whether they are · playing or col-
lector cards. This distinction is what that 
makes .cards valuable· cultural artifacts for 
scholars. "I was .intrigued by · the concept 
of making a definite distinction between 
cards [manufactured] for actual · playing 
and cards created for. aesthetic purposes," 
says William Keller, the librarian respon-
sible for cataloging Cary's collection. "Rec-
ognizing the difference was the key to fig-
uring out how to descr~be the collection 
so future researchers could extract the cul-
tural meaning important for their work." 


The design of standard playing cards-
the ones fouhd on blackjack tables, in 
household game drawers, and up the ma-
gician's sleeve 
has never gone through 
dramatic changes. The non-standard col-
lector cards, on the other hand, can be 
read as unique. statements about the cul-
ture of the time. As Timothy Young, a 
curator at the Beinecke, notes, the design 
of non-standard cards is often as much 
a political and social statement as it is a 
creative one. "Through playing cards, one 
can read historical trends, the develop-
ment of printing technology, the com-
memoration of events and phenomena, 
and the mindset of people at play," Young 
says. The presidential campaign deck from 
1892, for example, could be an invaluable 
artifact for a historian of the period. The 
natural hierarchy of a suit also lends itself 
to social commentary. "The playing card is 
a kind of societal mirror," Keller explains. 


The immense breadth of the collection of-
fers scholars a means of comparing socio-
political artifacts from different eras and 
locations, an opportunity to compare ~ rd 
packs issued in a particular geographic re-
gion, for example. Through comparison 
of the court cards and other elements, one 
discovers differences that may relate to the 
contemporary material culture." 


The dialectic between standard and 
non-standard extends beyond playing 
cards. "Folk art has a linguistic and cul-
tural dimension that is very different from 
the aesthetic concerns of high art," Keller 
points out by way of comparison. "These 
two strands of development are part of 
larger-scale modes of interpreting language 
and culture." Even though serious analysis 
of cards may seem eccentric, their study re-
veals an important distinction between ob-
jects meant for a purpose and those meant 
for visual appreciation. Keller insists that 
his time with the collection helped him to 
"develop a theoretical toolkit that aided 
my later study of the history of art and ar-
chitecture." 


Yet the very consistency of "standard" 
cards contains a telling cultural narrative. 
Hearts, spades, diamonds and clubs unite 
the college kid on poker night with the 
grandmotherly bridge aficionado and the 
card sharks of yore. By deeming a stan-
dard playing deck as worthy of collection 
as a tangram-decorated English deck from 
1795, Cary endowed cultural significance 
to objects both average and unique. His 
collection at Beinecke thus invites students 
to look for historical narratives not merely 
in their textbooks and course packets but 
in the materiality of the every day.

**Title: ROCKING & ROLLING**

ROCKING & ROLLING 
By day, they are massage therapists. 
Graphic designers. 
Teachers. 
Mothers. 
But when night falls, these women can 
be found rink-side, assuming colorful 
pseudonyms like Rinko Starr and Anita 
Chainsaw, lacing up their roller skates, and 
duking it out in the dog-eat-dog world of 
women's roller derby. 


They are the CT 
RollerGirls, self-proclaimed daughters of 
the American derby revolution, and Con-
necticut's first ahd only female flat-track 
roller derby league. 


But this clearly isn't the roller derby of 
the 1960s and early '70s, .a televised "en-
tertainment sport" comparable to profes-
sional wrestling, and often . resulting in 
on-screen brawls between skaters. 
Nor 
is it the scripted story of a misfit's derby 
paradise, a.S depicted in the Drew Barry-
more production Whip It! starring Ellen 
Page. This incarnation of roller derby has 
an entirely different flavor. 


The recent revival comes as a kind of 
revolution. It is female empowerment on 
wheels, a kind of third-wave feminism 
that is inspiring everyday women from 
all walks of life to throw on a pair of knee 
pads 
and perhaps a glittery tutu 
and 
roll out into jam formation. 


To the untrained eye, the game is total 
chaos. It is a blur of flailing limbs, pound-
ing music, and slippery spills. 
Learn-
ing how to fall is a must. Though players 
wear helmets, mouthguards, and wrist, 
elbow, and knee pads, broken bones and 
bruises are harsh realities. Parker Poison, a 
member of the league's all-star travel team 
known as the Stepford Sabotage, points 
out, "No one goes out there to hurt each 
other and we all try to play the sport as 
clean as possible." Yet, out on the track, 
competitive spirits reign. 
Excitement is 
palpable, adrenaline is pumping, and ani-
mal instinct takes over. 


Five players from each team will make 
their way into the rink to begin the first 
jam. There will be several two-minute 
"jams" within two thirty-minute periods. 
The girls form a pack made up of block-
ers and pivots of both teams. One "jam-
mer" from each team lines up several paces 
behind the pack. When the first whistle 
sounds, the pack begins to skate, with each 
player maneuvering to get the best posi-
tion possible in the cluster. A second shrill 
whistle, and the two jammers are off. It is 
their job to weave in and out of the block-
ers and pivots, racing to be the first jam-
mer to fight through the pack. Team mates 
within the pack try to dear the way for 
their jammer, while simultaneously block-
ing the opposing jammer from making her 
way to the front. Once the jammers make 
their way past the opposing pack, they 
race around the rink, attempting to lap as 
many members of the opposing team as 
possible. The more players they pass, the 
more points their teams earn. 


"Roller derby allows women to be all of 
those things that women are told they can't 
be all at once: smart, sexy, and athletic," 
says Poison. 


But dynamism, in this case, is a good 
thing. "This sport is new, and there is. no 
preconceived notion of what the ideal 
body is for roller derby," Poison says. 
"Some of the most amazing derby skaters 
do not have what is normally considered 
an athletic body type. But with our sport, 
there is a place for everyone to excel re-
gardless of their body." 


That's not to say that the ConnectiCut 
Rollergirls don't train hard at their sport. 
Stepford Sabotage practices three times 
a week for two hours and finished ninth 
overall at Eastern Regionals in 2009. And 
team members train off of their skates, 
working with personal trainers to boost 
power and agility. "Most of [our women] 
work full-time while balancing family," 
says one Stepford Sabotage skater who 
rolls under the pseudonym Sassin Assas-
sin, "and they still skate six hours a week." 


There is a movement to replace the ca-
cophony of brightly colored knee-highs, 
hot pink fishnets, or glitzy mini-skirts with 
standardized uniforms, and many players 
have traded in their witty aliases 
Eleanor 
Bruisevelt, Murphy's Outlaw, and Violet 
Riot, to name a few 
for their real names. 


But watching the girls skate around the 
track elbowing their competition out 
of the way, it is hard to believe that any 
amount of standardization could muffie 
these women's spunk.
