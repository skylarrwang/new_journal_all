Yale says construction of 
the new colleges is on hold. 
So why can't they give a 
straight answer? 
By Max Ehrenfreund 
THE FUTURE OF YALE CoLLEGE is spelled 
out in capital letters on a chart hanging on 
the plywood wall of Turner Construction 
Company's field office. Above it is a color-
ful schematic of the Prospect-Sachem-Ca-
nal Street triangle where Turner will build 
Yale's two new residential colleges after 
razing all the buildings currently on the 
site. In this office, information about Yale 
is presented without the prim typographic 
elegance characteristic of University docu-
ments, but no clarity is lost. "PHASE II 
ABATEMENT AND DEMOLITION" 
is scheduled for completion in 20 12. In 
November of that year, construction of the 
new colleges will begin. And, at the bot-
tom of the chart, in red letters, the date 
July 2015 is listed beside "CONSTRUC-
TION OF NEW COLLEGES COM-
PLETE." 
But since Yale's endowment fell sharply 
in the fall of last year, the administration 
has been forced to postpone the project 
indefinitely, and University officials have 
insisted that there is no way to predict 
when Yale will be in a financial position 
to begin construction. No one connected 
to the project is willing to guarantee that 
the chart in Turner Construction's porta-
ble predicts anything with certainty. The 
project manager there, who said he was 
not allowed to speak with reporters, de-
scribed the timeline as a best-case scenario. 
The Office of Public Affairs would not 
confirm even the Turner project manager's 
guarded assessment. A one-sentence email 
from Yale spokesperson Gila Reinstein 
explained, "There is no specific targeted 
completion date for the new residential 
colleges at this point." 

That may be the school's official po-
sition, but on August 29, the Yale Daily 
News reported that President Richard 
Levin mentioned 2015 or 2016 as prob-
able dates for the opening of the new col-
leges. Perhaps he and his advisors have a 
better idea of the timeline than they're let-
ting on. Despite the apparent uncertainty 
surrounding Yale's fiscal position, alumni 
contributions have allowed Yale to begin 
the initial stages of the project. Gift money 
was used to complete the planning and de-
sign of the colleges and is now paying for 
the process of demolishing the buildings 
currently standing on the site. 

No one connected to the proj-
ect is willing to guarantee that 
the chart in Turner Construc-
tions portable predicts any-
thing with certainty. 

Asked why Yale had decided to begin 
demolition right away even though con-
struction might not begin for some time, 
Deputy Provost J. Lloyd Suttle wrote in 
an email, "We want to make sure that we 
are ready to begin construction as soon as 
gifts to cover the cost of construction are 
received. 
Keep in mind that before we 
can begin construction, we will not only 
have to remove the existing buildings, but 
we will also have to expand and relocate a 
number of underground utilities, particu-
larly steam and chilled water pipes." 

Not all were convinced by this explana-
tion. When the Yale Daily News reported 
that demolition had begun, one online 
reader commented, "I don't understand. 
Building for those egregious new col-
leges won't even begin for several y~ars. It 
shouldn't take that long to do the utilities 
work, as they claim. Why is Yale rushing 
ahead to demolish the whole area so quick-
ly? Are they worried that public opinion 
will finally get traction and circumvent 
their plans to take over the whole city?" 
THE NEW JOURNAL 


PRovosT SuTTLE's explanation also 
does not agree with numbers from the Of-
fice ofDevelopment. Although design and 
demolition at the site have been funded by 
alumni contributions, the Office of Devel-
opment's $500 million fundraising goal 
will also go towards the increased expenses 
from faculty hiring and expansion of other 
programs made necessary by a larger stu-
dent body. Fundraising, says Vice Presi-
dent of Development Inge Reichenbach, 
will ultimately need to be supplemented 
by endowment returns and probably by 
cash from selling bonds. 

Since fundraising for the construction 
won't materialize right away, it makes sense 
that Yale claims to be uncertain when con-
struction will move forward. After all, the 
timing of the University's decision to build 
will have to depend on the state of the 
global economy, the success of fundrais-
ing and how quickly Yale can recruit ad-
ditional faculty. Finally, Woodbridge Hall 
will have to make a strategic assessment of 
just how important the new colleges are in 
the long term and determine what, if any-
thing, the University should give up in or-
der to see them come to fruition. "I don't 
think anyone has a crystal ball to give you 
the specifics," said Tom Conroy, Deputy 
Director of the Office of Public Affairs. 

For some, the possibility that the 
school began demolishing buildings with-
out a clear plan for funding the project is 
even more alarming. Joel Muraoka (YC 
'81), for one, was "furious they didn't set 
the money aside in bonds or something 
before the demolition was undertaken." 
He added that he did not intend to make a 
donation to support the new colleges, be-
cause "the way the funding was handled 
was negligent and now other people are 
being asked to pay for the mistake. Sounds 
like the bank bailouts." 

BUT VICE PRESIDE T 
REICHENBACH 
says that, in general, alumni have respond-
ed generously in support of expansion. 
November 2009 
Since June 2008, when the Yale Corpo-
ration formally approved the expansion 
of Yale College, alumni have contributed 
$168 million. Those contributions come 
during a difficult period for fundraising 
following the economic crisis in the fall of 
2008. "You couldn't even get an appoint-
ment in those days to discuss a donation 
with an alumnus," says Reichenbach. Only 
recently have donors become more willing 
to open their wallets. 

In her ninth-floor office across the 
Green from Phelps Gate, Reichenbach 
gestures out the window toward the build-
ings on top of Science Hill. "I feel like I 
can see the whole campus from here," she 
says. Once construction is finished, she 
will probably be able to see the brick tow-
ers of the new colleges rising behind the 
greenish dome of the Rotunda as well. It 
is a clear October day, arid New Haven 
is lit up with sunlight and autumn color. 
From here, it's hard not to have quixotic 
thoughts about Yale's future. 

When you can take in all of 
Yale in one glance like this, it's 
hard not to be filled with ro-
mantic feelings at the thought 
of Yale's future. 

Reichenbach is cenainly optimistic. 
Alumni, she says, are excited about the 
new residential colleges for many of the 
same reasons current students love the ex-
isting twelve. "It's not just housing," she 
explains, choosing her words thoughtful-
ly. "It's the intensity of relationships and 
friendships, the education that takes place 
when people are thrown together and start 
talking. It opens up minds and views." 

Yale's online giving catalogue gives 
some idea of how that fundraising goal 
will be reached. Although the new colleges 
themselves will not be named for donors, 
prices have been set for most of the smaller 
spaces within the college. A dining hall is 
five million dollars; a library is two. Each 
college will have its own TV Lounge, at a 
quarter of a million apiece. A Servery will 
cost you the same. 

BUT AS EXORBITANT as the online cata-
logue of rooms may seem, the Develop-
ment Office's methods have proven effec-
tive. On the site map in their field office, 
several buildings are marked with bold 
black X's. A solid red square in the nose of 
the triangular site represents 86 Prospect 
Street, a medium-sized house sitting at the 
intersection ofTrumbull and Prospect. 
Or . at least it was until October 28. 
That morning at 86 Prospect, a large back-
hoe sat on its treads amid a heap oflumber 
in a deep pit, loading d~bris into an idling 
dump truck. 

Professor Amy Hungerford, Director of 
Undergraduate Studies in the English De-
partment, thinks it is a positive sign that 
no promises have been made. She would 
see cause for alarm if Yale clung too te-
naciously to "definitive statements about 
what's staying and what's going and what's 
getting built." Hungerford is cautious-
ly optimistic about construction, even 
though her department, like most others, 
is already struggling with a constrained 
budget. 

She notes that the economic situation 
has created a strategic opportunity. It is 
probable not only that building costs are 
much lower now than they were two years 
ago, but also that they may increase again 
before the endowment regains value and 
fundraising goals are met.  

· Funhermore, while budget cuts areal-
ways difficult, Professor Hungerford sees a 
cha nee for Yale to reassess its priorities. ''A 
recession like this is an opponunity to look 
at the intellectual landscape - what fields 
seem less imponant now than they did 
twenty years ago. That's a necessary pro-
cess, and a really hard process," she says. 
Perhaps, she suggests, there are programs 
the University could afford to eliminate or 
scale back in order to allow construction 
to begin sooner, to take advantage of low 
building costs. 

"In the midst of cutting other 
operating expenses, dropping 
hundreds of millions of dol-
lars on gothic mansions for 
our students is bad P R for the 
nation as well as for faculty. 
The University should wait. " 

Professor Christopher Udry, chairman 
of the Economics Department, looks for-
ward eagerly to the construction of the 
new residential colleges. "The university 


getting bigger means on balance a better 
educational environment for students and 
a better research environment for faculty." 
But unlike Hungerford, Udry thinks that 
Yale isn't ready to start building yet. "They 
cannot go ahead and build the colleges 
until they push forward with faculty ex- .. 
pansion and curricular development," he 
insists. He says his department would need · 
five years to hire enough new faculty to ac-
commodate an expanded student body. 

It is expected that demand for economics 
courses will increase by more than ten per-
cent, since international students, whose . 
numbers continue to grow, tend to be 
more interested than American students in 
the social sciences, especially economics. 
But he expects the administration will co-
operate in helping his department expand. 
Jonathan Dach (YC '08) has always 
been a committed supporter of expan-
sion. While he was a student, . Dach was 
a member of the study group directed by 
President Levin to explore how the· plan 
for the expansion of Yale College could 
be best implemented. But he agrees with 
Udry. "In the midst of cutting other op-
erating expenses, dropping hundreds of 
millions of dollars on gothic mansions for 
our students is bad PR for the nation as 
well as for faculty. The University should 
wait," he says. 

BUT IF FACULTY ARE UPBEAT about the 
project, students seem to be either op-
posed or apathetic. A Yale Daily News poll 
in February 2008 found that only about 


a quarter of students supported expansion 
in principle, even fewer liked the idea of 
building the new colleges at the Prospect-
Sachem site: "Everyone thinks that their 
Yale .is the best," Dach explains. "There 
is reluctance on the behalf of current stu-
dents to innovate or change what works 
so well for them." Time will tell whether 
students' skepticism is misinformed or 
well-placed. 

Asked to explain the difference in opin-
ion between students and faculty on the 
question of expansion, Hungerford says, "I 
think it's because students are here for four 
years. For us, Yale is subject to change. We 
see things that seem so close to the hearts 
of students- four years later, they're gone." 

The story of Hammond Hall is a dem-
onstration of the University's capacity 
to evolve and change over time. During 
September and October, preservation-
ist groups such as the New Haven Urban 
Design League particularly objected to the 
demolition of Hammond Hall, both be-
cause of its architectural significance and 
its age: it has stood on Mansfield Street 
since 1904. 

The Hall was in Alderman Greg More-
head's ward, Ward 22. Regarding objec-
tions to its demolition, Morehead said he 
thought most residents liked the idea of 
the new residential colleges. Then he add-
ed, "Yale has been good about trying to do 
whatever it is the residents want, because 
they want to be a friendly neighbor. But 
when it comes to Yale, things are still go-
ing to get done, no matter what." 

Events bore out his prediction. On the 
evening of October 30, a ruined fa<;:ade is 
all that remains of Hammond Hall after 
a day of demolition. Birds fly in and out · 
of the empty windows, and the sun sets 
just inside the main double doors, which 
had been burst open by a flood of rubble. 
Large blocks of brick and cement lay on 
the porch on the sidewalk, as ifHammond 
Hall had built been of Legos and someone 
had been interrupted in the middle of tak- · 
ing them apart. 

Large blocks of brick and ce-
ment lay on the porch on the 
sidewalk~ as if Hammond 
Hall had built been of Legos 
and someone had been inter- · 
rupted in the _middle of tak-
ing it apart~ without time to 
clean up the pieces~ 

Perhaps in another hundred years, this 
spot will be covered in the debris of the 
fourteenth college. No· matter how im-
portant the new colleges seem to us and 
to President Levin, all the controversy and 
hope that surrounds them today will one 
day be forgotten and discarded, as was 
Hammond Hall, in favor of something 
newer.
