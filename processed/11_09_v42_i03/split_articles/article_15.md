Off-Track 
Graduate students look for hope in the worst job market in years. 
MIKE O'HARA"' is on the academic job 
market for the second year in a row. Sit-
ting on a marble slab in Yale's Beinecke 
Plaza, he pulls out a single, typed sheet 
of paper that listS all the open positions 
in his field. "Best BetS" includes spotS at 
ten or a dozen universities, "Long ShotS" 
listS places at fifteen. Then, at the bottom 
of the sheet, there's a slim category called 
"Hail Marys." These jobs, it seems, might 
only descend from heaven as a result of ar-
dent prayer. 

Mike's wife, whom he met here at Yale's 
Graduate School for the ArtS and Sciences, 
told him not to talk to journalistS about 
his job search. In fact, he told me, he 
was sure that he would be the only grad 
student currently on the job market who 
would be willing to talk to me. Mike feels 
vulnerable, sensing he's under the hawk-
eyes of potential employers. In spite of the 
danger, though, Mike wants-needs---to 
get the word out about his and his class-
mates' experiences. 

"The mood" among his classmates, 
Mike says, "is one of despair." Mike knows 
how slim his own odds of finding a pro-
fessorial job are. The fact that he chose a 
rather unusual and multidisciplinary field 
rather limits his choices. And all of the 
jobs on his list, he knows, will have about 
two hundred applicants each. 

But Mike has seen it all before. First, 
a job list comes out in September. Then, 
many hopefuls apply. Next, the initial ap-
plicant pool is whittled down to a hand-
ful who undergo tense interviews in ho-
tel rooms. Ultimately, only three of those 
get invited for an on-campus interview. 
When the economic downturn hit last 
year, however, up to two-thirds of the jobs 
posted by universities suddenly disap-
peared. After what he termed "a cascade 
of cancellations," there were even fewer 
places to look, and Mike and many of his 
classmates were forced to stay in New Ha-
ven for another year to tty again. In this 
time, he's coming up with a second book 
project to contrast with his dissertation. 
And he's formulating a Plan B. He can't 
afford to stay here another year and endure 
this taXing process for a third rime. People 
have got to realize, he emphasizes, that be-
ing an academic isn't the only way to lead 
an intellectual life. 

STEVEN SMYTH, Alfred Cowles Profes-
sor of Political Science at Yale and Master 
of Branford CoUege, believes it is the f.ue 
of higher education to persist despite the 
ravages of the economy. *Universities, col-
leges," he says. "We manage to survive." A 
tenured faculty_ member, he has the free-
dom to work on the topics that fire his 
curiosity: a few years ago it was the 17th 
cenrwy Jewish philosopher Spinoza and 
then the 20th century political thinker 
Leo Strauss; now he writes and lectures on 
Lincoln. "It's a wonderful life," he said. 
"You get to do what you care about. Not 
many people can say that." 

In his course on political philosophy, 
he talks with great admiration for the birth 
of higher education, the era when Plato es-
tablished his Academy and when philoso-
phy was considered, among the Greeks, to 
be an expression of erotic desire. "Yale and 
places like this are distant ancestors of this 
idea of educational utopias ... We're Plato's 
children in that way." 

But the values of today's university sys-
tem are irrevocably changed. 
Discovery 
of the good life through studying life's es-
sential questions has faded out of view and 
been replaced by another goal: "marketable 
skills." To Professor Smith, the academic 
life cannot come out of a determination to 
lead a professor's career: it is the work of 
fate. "The subject chooses you," he says. 

BuT FOR EMILY CoiT, the subject that 
chose her was not enough to keep her 
within the world of academia. 
Unlike 
Professor Smith, she never tried going on 
the job market. Although she's still listed 
on the English Department's directory as 
a 6th year graduate student, she left Yale 
last May to complete her dissertation on 
her own and to teach at a private high 
school in Massachusetts. The transition 
hasn't been perfectly straightforward: this 
Victorianist, with an interest in authors 
like Edith Wharton and Henry James, 
said that high school teaching has forced 
her to review her "kind of lacking" gram-
matical knowledge. Students balk at being 
assigned a one-hundred page book to be 
read over the course of three weeks. Dead-
lines are no longer self-imposed but are 
very real, and she is as busy as she's ever 
been. 

"I wanted to have conversations about 
literature that were more accessible, more 
about human moral problems," she said of 
her decision to leave the-academy behind. 
Though her two dissertation advisors 
urged her to pursue a professorial career, 
Coit was drawn to aspects of the discipline 
she felt were undervalued at the university 
level. While she acknowledges that she had 
a wonderful time at Yale, and that "the 
space and money and time for intellectual 
play at universities is unique," she and the 
academic establishment had divergent pri-
orities. She wants to read books "because 
they are beautiful, for their political is-
sues, and human drama." Her high school 
students understand that. About the pas-
sion she brings to the classroom, she says, 
"There's a little bit of missionary zeal in 
me. 

ANoTHER SCHOLAR I talked to was, like 
Coit, once on the verge of breaking with 
academia. Today, his picture is featured on 
the front page of the glossy, vivid brochure 
advertising "Graduate Study at Yale." He 
is in his doctoral robe of scarlet and black 
velvet, wearing a cropped white beard and 
round glasses, grinning broadly under his 
tassled academic cap and holding a strange 
kind of university scepter topped with 
a globe of crystal. He is Jon Butler, the 
Dean of Yale's Graduate School, and after 
graduate study at the University of Min-
nesota and a stint at Calstate Bakerville, 
winding up with an offer at Yale was an in-
credible windfall. Having almost given up 
and tried another life, he is now a foremost 
scholar on the history religion in America 
who has published award-winning books 
and spoken as an expert on various TV 
and radio programs. 

Sitting comfortably in his s11 rrmmd-
ings-a wide, airy office near the entrance 
of the Hall of Graduate Studies-Butler 
isn't ready to call the current -downswing 
in academic jobs a "crisis." The fact that a 
drop in hiring has coincided with general 
economic decline is what makes it more 
of an alarming piece of news, he said. He 
has wimessed ups and downs in a01demic 
hiring since the late '60s. Having trouble 
finding a job, he says, is nothing new, and 
frankly, jobs aren't really the point. Butler 
makes clear that applicants are nearly al-
ways people who are there to study 
not 
to attain a professional degree. ''I'm in-
clined ·to think that most are academically 
and intellectually driven to do deep study," 
he says, and notes that only a minority of 
the students decide not to pursue an aca-
demic career after they have earned their 
Ph.D. After all, Ph .. D. candidates are self 
selecting, he says. "We don't pursue stu-
dents 
we don't go out and recruit." Not 
recruiting means that there will be stu-
dents like Emily Coit who at the end of six 
years will find their career goals diverging 
from those of many of her classmates. To 
Dean Butler, such cases are perfectly nor-
mal; the focus should be on pursuing an 
education and enjoying the moment. As 
we're standing and shaking hands at the · 
conclusion of our interview, Dean But-
ler smiles and offers some friendly advice 
to those who might engage in graduate 
study: don't worry about it. "Do what you 
want to do," he said cheerily. "Close your 
eyes, wake up in six years and take a look 
around at the job market." 

STEVEN PINCUS, the Director of Gradu-
ate Studies in the History Department, is 
equally unruffled about the futures of his 
students. Having received his Ph.D. nearly 
twenty years ago, he experiences a certain 
dista nee from the mood of panic on the 
ground. Yet he says that the reality of the 
situation is far better than the perception. 
Most of the jobs that were cancelled, he 
says, were at the bottom of the heap-
jobs that he believes Yale graduate stu-
dents would be overqualified foL And Yale 
graduate students are eminently qualified 
to be professors, especially today. "I have 
a strong sense that every single one (of my 
students) that's written a good dissertation 
has gotten a good job" he says. Being pre-
pared to get a good job, though, requires 
a lot more than it used to. Having had 
several academic articles published, Pincus 
says, is "pretty much de rigeur," and stu-
dents are expected to "perform as profes-
sionals." 

Increased professionalization, however, 
comes with a cost. Pincus becomes very 
thoughtful when he talks about the down-
side to the professionalization of scholar-
ship. While universities and their students 
benefit, scholarship itself may suffer. "We 
don't encourage high-risk dissertations," 
he told me. He says that if one of his stu-
dents came to him with· a very daring plan 
for research, he would be likely to dissuade 
him. "It's a much more professionalized 
existence," he says about today's academic 
life, and graduate students must write dis-
sertations that conform to detailed stan-
dards if they want a good chance of get-
ting a job. The improvements in graduate 
education have been immense and there is 
"an overwhelming difference" in the qual-
ity of teaching that graduate students re-
ceive today as compared with the teaching 
they received a generation ago. But in this 
generation, Pincus says with a real sense of 
regret, "opportunities for paradigm-shift-
ing dissertation are lost." It would take a_ 
true maverick, an academic rebel-genius, 
it seems, to write a dissertation that would 
shake up a field. 

PAUL SHIN JUST MAY BE that maverick, 
and happier for it. A fourth-year gradu-
ate student in the history of science and 
medicine, nothing about Shin's approach 
to graduate school has been typical. · M-
ter earning an '1 ndergraduate degree in 
economics, he enrolled in medical school, 
but soon became fascinated in medical 
humanities, reading about the history of 
science on the side. He decided to take 
a six year break 
from medical 
school to delve into the topics that go un-
addressed in the average M.D. program: 
spiritualism, uncertainty, the practice of 
mesmerism and animal magnetism in 
19th century American medicine, the 
vague boundaries between medical prac-
tice, magic, and religious belief. 

If his 
interests sound whimsical or unconven-
tional, Shin is used to defying expecta-
tion. Compared to other medical students 
who are eager to get a degree and begin 
residency, he seems at home with the idea 
of taking even more time to study. His 
interests extend far beyond his field. For 
Shin, graduate school has been a time to 
nurture a love of writing 
he coordinates 
a "writing history'' group and talks about 
the pleasures of writing and storytelling. 
Instead of writing something purely aca-
demic for his dissertation, he muses, he'd 
like to end up with a book that Penguin or 
Viking could publish. He talks in terms 
of plot and characters instead of thesis 
and conclusion, and he imagines his au-
dience including his fellow physicians or 
his friends pursuing "complimentary and 
alternative medicine," whose approach 
to their profession would be enriched by 
historical thinking. To Shin, who reads 
Thomas Kuhn's landmark history Structure 
of Scientific Revolutions along with his pa-
thology textbook, doctoring and the hu-
manities are inseparable. "Grad school," 
he says, "is this great time where you de-
velop an understanding of some aspect of 
human experience." 

THE LAST GRADUATE student I talked to 
tends bar where Plato's children go to get a 
drink. Erik Graham-Smith runs the Gry-
phon's at the Graduate and Professional 
Student Center at Yale. Last spring Gra-
ham-Smith earned his Master's of Divin-
ity, which he describes as a course of study 
in "very academic hardcore systematic the-
ology and ethics ... books with 14-syllable 
words." Unlike his classmates up at the 
Divinity School, Graham-Smith has had 
much closer contact with students in the 
Graduate School. At once an insider and 
an outsider 
his degree will allow him to 
someday become a Jesuit priest 
he shares 
many things in common with them. Sit-
ting on the chilly patio outside the warm, 
glowing lights of his bar, he talked, not 
without a little humor, about how the 
Masters in Divinity is "notoriously a de-
gree people get when they're figuring stuff 
out 
it's a spiritual degree." In that way 
it's not unlike what a graduate degree 
can be for many people. "As a recession 
avoider," he says, a divinity degree is much 
the same as a Ph.D., and he has a number 
of friends who are earning doctorates but 
who plan on pursuing careers outside of 
academic research. He's in his mid-twen-
ties, and pauses to tell me that his grandfa-
ther, at his age, was running a family farm. 
He had already been to war, married, and 
had children. Today, for those who attend 
graduate school, things can be much dif-
ferent. Extending one's education, paus-
ing for a degree that will not inevitably 
lead to a career doesn't necessarily have to 
be a waste of one's titne. Shin, the histo-
rian and future physician, says his last four 
years have been "about stillness, listening, 
finding what's really interesting... about 

Would the Greeks have disagreed?
