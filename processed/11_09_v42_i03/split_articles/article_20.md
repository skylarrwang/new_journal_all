Can a new generation of Yale-trained teachers turn New Haven's schools around. 
REDELL ARMsTRONG (GRD '10) wants 
to talk on a Saturday· morning, so we 
schedule an earlybird meeting: 9:30 a.m. 
Any other day of the week, Armstrong 
would have been awake for three hours 
already. Today, he comes a few minutes 
late 
on Saturdays, he doesn't have to an-
swer to thirty impatient middle-schoolers. 
Armstrong arrived in New Haven this 
summer after five years spent teaching so-
cial studies in Harlem at a school where 
chalk and paper were in short supply. 
He has a jolly demeanor, even as he talks 
about the grievous social and racial inequi-
ties that drew him to teaching in the first 
place. And since beginning the Yale Mas-
ter's Program in Education Studies earlier 
this year, he has become part of a grow-
ing cadre of Yale students eager to foster 
learning and strengthen the partnership 
between the University and New Haven's 
public schools. 

Many st 
who go to 
school just two blocks away 
from Yale see the University 
as aloof or altogether inacces-
sible.

But despite the verve and camaraderie 
of a Yale-based band of educators, New 
Haven public schools retain their share of 
persisting problems. Retention rates are 
low, and racial inequities still exist. Many 
students who go to school just two blocks 
away from Yale see the University as aloof 
or altogether inaccessible. New Haven 
public schools are home to over 20,000 
students, over a quarter of whom live below 
the poverty threshold, and many of whom 
never complete high school. Since starting 
to student teach in September, Armstrong 
has found that many--of the difficulties he 
encountered in Harlem plague New Ha-
ven as well. "The city is still working out 
how to retain students, and we have far to 
go in learning to effectively teach youths 
of color. Smaller issues, like the traditional 
parent-teacher conferences, are problem-
atic, too; many parents are working two 
or three jobs and can't make it over to the 
school. We need to come up with solutions 
within that culture, not outside of it." 

]ACK Gn.I.ETI'E, the director of Yale's 
Teacher's Program, has a waiting room 
for his office at 3 5 Broadway Street. It's a 
luxurious fixture, even at Yale. The couch 
outside is just within reach of a coffee table 
topped with colorful educational books. It 
looks and feels like a non-menacing doc-
tor's office, and appropriately so. Gillette, 
after all, is the doctor of public education 
at Yale, and involvement in the New Ha-
ven public schools is still in clinical trials. 

Though today Yale boasts a new Mas-
ter's program in education, a revamped 
undergraduate teacher preparation course, 
and an expanded office of New Haven and 
State Affairs, the university's engagement 
with its surrounding public school system 
is in its infancy. The programs that have 
come to define the university's partnership 
with New Haven public education 
the 
Public School Internship program, Com-
munity Health Educators, and other 
Dwight Hall student outreach 
are all less than two decades old. When 
Gillette arrived in New Haven thirty years 
ago for his first teaching job at Hillhouse 
High School, Yale's relationship with the 
New Haven education system was mini-
mal at best. "You wouldn't have thought 
Yale was in the same town," Gillette said. 
"I never saw a Yale student in my ten years 
at Hillhouse 
volunteering or otherwise." 

ine years ago, Gillette decided to rewrn 
to Yale and change things from within as 
Yale's D~ector ofTeacher Preparation and 
Education Studies. 

CLAUDIA MERSON, the Director of 
Public School Partnerships for Yale, works 
on similar issues from her office at New 
Haven and State Affairs. "It takes a village 
to raise a child, but in urban America it 
takes a traffic cop to manage the villagers. 
That's my job 
to take these great gifts 
and the passion of Yale students and steer 
them to public schools so that they can do 
the most good." 

Since President Levin took office, she 
says, the boundaries between Yale and 
New Haven have become noticeably blur-
rier. Thousands of New Haven students 
, visit Yale each year: · the athletic teams -
hold camps for over 350 kids every sum-
mer, and the Peabody Museum and the 
Yale University Art Gallery offer frequent 
events for class visits. 

ccThe schools don't look that 
hard, " Gillette said. ccThey're 
beauti 1 buildings, and the 
tone: is . not a bad tone. It 
doesn't eel edgy. New teachers 
can get lulled into thinking, 
it can't be that hard. 'It is. " · 

For Gillette ·and his teacher training 
methods, this growing collaboration has 
required Yale's education programs to 
adopt a carefully tailored approach to the 
particular culture of the New Haven pub-
lic school system. He wants to ensure that 
Yale students were ready to face both the 
difficulties and the excitement of teaching 
in an urban environment. 

"You could probably go out tomor-
row and teach at Hopkins," he told me. 
"The students there probably learn in very 
sitnilar ways that you do. You're smart and 
you could figure it out. But," Gillette said, 
leaning forward as if telling me a secret, 
"if you go to Career High School, you 
have a moral and ethical responsibility to 
generate learning for all kind of folk who 
might be entirely different in their learn-
ing approaches and have entirely different 
histories of education 
and that is a sur-
prisingly difficult thing to do." 

As his students entered classrooms of 
their own and encountered these difficul-
ties, Gillette wanted to be able to continue 
24 
working with them, pinpointing problems 
and making sure that the training pro-
gram was effective. Yet the undergraduate 
students he worked with in the Teacher 
Preparation Program· rarely taught in New 
Haven after Commencement. A Master's 
Program, he reasoned, would put more 
talent into the New Haven public schools 
and provide feedback about the quality of 
instruction in the Yale education program 
itsel£ 

In 2005, Gillette went to Yale's admin-
istration with a plan for a new two-year 
Master's program in Education Studies. 
President Levin backed the proposal and 
sixty members of the graduate faculty ap-
proved it with a standing ovation. 

The program admitted its first class 
that year, a group of five candidates who 
would be trained in_ both theory and expe-
riential learning, all within the context of 
urban education. "We wanted to structure 
a program where each of those elements 
complimented the other," Gillette said. 
Every week, he and his colleagues observe 
each candidate in the classroom during 
the ·required student teaching component 
of the program. "We videotape, we audio-
tape, and we reflect. The analytic theories 
are there to help us try to unpack what we 
" 
see. 

. According to Gillette, problems in the 
.classroom arise in any number of ways, 
and each candidate in the program needs 
to learn to decipher their causes and po-
tential solutions. "A student was reflecting 
on a situation today and told me: 'You say 
it could be racial dynamic, you say it could 
be instructional dynamic, you say it could 
be because they're teenagers 
which is it?' 
I say, 'That's your job to figure out."' 

A lot of them think, 1f I could 
just obtain a job at Yale Uni-
versity, then I'd be set just like 
my parents, or like my· uncle 
or like my aunt. "' 

Armstrong, as a student, has enjoyed 
the challenge of this approach, particularly 
in contrast with the direct teaching style 
that defined his years in Harlem. "There, I 
was considered the source of information. 
My students were vessels I filled with that 
information. But in the Master's Program, 
there is constant engagement. The philos-
ophy is that we all 
the students, teach-
ers, and our Yale professors 
are working 
together to arrive at the answer." 

BuT LEARNING HOW to implement them 
are two different things, and the pleas-
ant appearance of New Haven Schools 
can make this implementation seem de-
ceptively easy. To first-year New Haven 
teachers accustomed, as Yale students, to · 
seeing the shiny exterior and frosted glass 
windows of places like Cooperative Arts 
and Humanities High, the existence of 
real urban problems can sometimes come 
as a shock. 

"The schools don't look that hard," Gil-
lette said. "They're beautiful buildings, and 
the tone is not a bad tone. It doesn't feel 
_edgy. If you go to PS 302 in the Bronx, 
there's a kind of alignment based on the 
look and the feel. .~ You're prepared for a 
.certain set of difficulties. In New Haven, 
though, you have a differen-t set of expecta-
tions and new teachers can get lulled into 
thinking, 'It can't be that hard.' It is." 

DESPITE ARMsTRONG's appreciation for 
the Graduate Program, the hallowed halls 
ofYale where takes his theory-based classes 
every week feel very distant from the stu-
dents he teaches. "Sure, they aspire to leap 
out of their community and be associated 
with the University in one way or another, 
but they can't picture themselves as stu-
dents. A lot of them think, 'If I could just 
obtain a job at Yale University, then I'd be 
set just like my parents, or like my uncle or 
like my aunt."' The contrast is significant, 
he said, between the way his students per-
ceive themselves and the image they have 
of Yale students. "I don't think they see 
that people of color do attend Yale, or. at 
least not in large numbers. They see that 
the majority are white and they start look-
ing in other places." 

FoR YALE STUDENTS, too, working in 
the New Haven public schools means en-
tering a world that is at once familiar and 
surpnsmg. 

Minh Tran, who graduated from Yale 
last spring, spent two summers reaching in 
New Haven schools before he began work-
ing full-time at Elm City College Prep ear-
lier this year. Even during those summers, 
he said, his relationship with New Haven 
was always from the perspective of a Yale
