The Game Theory of Love
Modern love? It's all about economics.

BOYS ARE LIKE DEODORANT.
This unlikely equation carne to me
while I stood, as bumblingly confused as
a pre-teen at a middle school dance, amid
cosmetics and candy at the local drugstore.
I was struggling to choose a new anti-per-
spirant. The one I applied daily had ceased
to make my underarms feel powder-fresh,
and the rows and rows of deodorizing
product that cluttered the shelves of aisle
nine offered the elusive promise of product
perfection.

Deodorants come in as many permu-
tations of fragrance, substance, and brand
as boys come in shapes, sizes, and summer
break plans. I faced the burdensome boon
of overwhelming variety. Did I want pow-
der or gel? Stick or roll on? Did I want a
brown-haired boy or a blonde? A baseball
player or a bookish intellecrual? Maybe
I didn't even want a guy at all. Penelope
Cruz is pretty smoking ...

Please don't hold such indecision
against me. I'm the child of an educator,
a lawyer, and the global rise of mass con-
sumer culture. I am, to some extent, the
product of produces. Like so many other
American rwenty-somethings, my daily
life has been characterized by a staggering
amount of choice and the corresponding
promise of the perfect one. Gone are the
days of, "If the shoe fits, wear it." The
shoe also needs to go with the new pants
you just bought. The shoe needs to make
your cankles look less cankle-y. It needs
to be cheap but not too cheap, stylish but
not too stylish. In other words, the shoe
needs to fit perfectly in order to be worth
wearing. American consumer culture has
guaranteed us perfectly personalized prod-
ucts, and we expect no less of our romantic
partners.

If dating in the 21st century is like
shopping, Facebook is Amazon.com-
a one-stop online shop for all romantic
needs.

View Facebook photos ro see if a
crush is aesthetically appealing. Check a
crush's relationship status to see if he or she
is in stock. Place an order with a message
or a wall post. Track your order's progress
on his or her mini-feed.

I'm among the last candidates for
someone who'd come to consider love a
consumer transaction. A hippie born too
late, I had a peace sign on my retainer,
doodled daisy chains in the margins of my
homework, and really, truly believed that
all you need is love.

But something happened.

I never asked to consider love a com-
modity, but it's hard not ro. Everything
is marketable in the 21st century. These
days, businessmen sell propetty rights to
stars so distant they've likely already super-
novaed, and crazy eBay sellers auction off
ghosts-that's right, ghosts, which, even if
they do exist, are impossible to ship. Love
is among the less outrageous commodities
on the ~ket. When even the country's
political leaders (frequently, constantly)
pay for romance, the notion that people
approach love in the same way that a shop-

' expected.

The economy, it seems, is the bottom
line. So, it's no surprise that the vocabu-
lary of economics has crept into the lan-
guage of love, that economic theories can
explain today's romantics. We speak of
"emotional investments" and of singles be-
ing "on the market." Econ 101 's law of di-
minishing returns explains that the divorce
rate and hookup culture is an example of
portfolio diversification. Even the Beatles'
final proclamation of love
Paul's assur-
ance that, "In the end the love you take
is equal to the love you make"--can be
charted with a simple supply and demand
curve.

The problem is, the capitalist economy
as Adam Smith envisioned it is character-
ized by qualities that should be antithetical
to romance. Please follow along in your
textbooks:

I. THE IDEAL MARKET IS IMPERSONAL.
True for the market economy, but not
so much for the make-out economy. Still,
random hook-up culture permeates col-
lege campuses, where the exchange of such
basic biographical information as a first
name does not necessarily have to precede
Frenching.

2. THE IDEAL MARKET ECONOMY IS EF-
FICIENT.
That's okay if you're interested in sales,
not sex.

But sex aside, efficiency as an
overriding principle for romance is coun-
terintuitive. A quickie's quick, after all, but
the satisfaction's transient. Passion should
be love's modus operandi. And taking the
scenic route, spending time rather than
saving it, or any number of other ineffi-
ciencies characterize passion.

3· THE IDEAL
ECONOMY IS
TRANSPARENT.
Public dealing is absolutely fundamen-
tal to a functional financial economy. Pri-

vacy, on the other hand, ought to dictate
interpersonal exchanges. Still, an acquain-
tance of mine recently got a divorce, and
her Facebook friends discovered the news
when their mini-feeds alerted them that
she was "no longer listed as in a relation-
ship." A broken-heart icon appeared next
to the announcement.

EcoNOMIC PERFECTION is for stocks
and bonds, not studs and broads, studs
and studs, or broads and broads. The per-
fect financial market is an imperfect ro-
mantic market. In fact, the whole notion
of perfection
of what classical econo-
mists call a theoretical ideal and modern
.
lovers call a romantic fantasy
is precisely
what inhibits so many of us from deriving
satisfaction from relationships.

7he more important similar-
ity is that modern lovers, like
their parents and grandpar-
ents and great-grandparents,
are questing after a quixotic
ideal elusive as the perfectly
rational cunsumer.

So, modern love isn't that different
from the love of yore and the love of lore
after all. No, not because girls still go for
professors and boys still go for freshman-
though that pattern is likely to be peren-
nial.

The more important similarity is
that modern lovers, like their parents and
grandparents and great-grandparents, are
questing after a quixotic ideal, elusive as
the perfectly rational c:unsumer. The gen-
eration that first sat in theaters to watch
Disney's Cinderella surely felt the burden
of finding Prince Charming. The perfec-
tion of a fairy-tale ending has always been
true love's promise.

But perfection has
also always been
and always will be-
unachievable at any price.

The hope of "happily ever after" is
as tempting and as unattainable as the
thought of discovering the p~erless anti-
perspirant. What we have yet to appreci-
ate is that it's also undesirable. My par-
ents, who will soon be celebrating their
29th anniversary, know more about love
than even the most Petrarchan twenty-
something.

ot every minute of their
marriage has been happy. Still, when I'm
at home for the ever-rarer family dinner,
and my dad asks me with a dimpled smile,
"Doesn't Mom look beautiful tonight?" I
understand. More than I ever could when
faced with the limitless choices Rite Aid
'
presents me, I understand the value of im-
perfection. This sort of value can't be mea-
sured in GDP or GNP or in any other P,
for that matter. Its worth is too nuanced
for even the most thorough economist to
model, for even the most conscious con-
sumer to appraise.

It's also not something a twenty-one-
year old can swallow. Until I learn the les-
son for myself, I, like the generation that
I help form and that helps form me, will
continue to shop around in the hope of
finding that perfect someone. But, just be-
tween you and me: I don't buy it.
