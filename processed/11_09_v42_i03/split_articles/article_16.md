WHEN I ENTERED THE CAFETERIA of the 
Wexler-Grant Community School, a New 
Haven K-8 school, at 10:15, it was crunch 
time. Five lunch ladies, dressed in match-
ing red-collared shirts and hairnets, were 
scooping canned apricot halves into small 
plastic containers and covering the pans 
of lettuce and chopped meats with foil. 
When the apricots ran out, they moved 
onto applesauce. One of the ladies stepped 
forward, an unofficial spokesperson for the 
group. "You need to do something about 
this," she said, motioning toward the food. 
"Why would you give kids this on a cold 
day? A chef salad and it's all cold!" ·
The first onslaught is at 10:30 a.m. The 
youngest kids at Wexler-Grant Commu-
nity School rush into ·the cafeteria. Large 
and open, with patterned linoleum on 
the floors and plastic tables with built-in 
stools, it looks just like any other cafeteria. 
Kids play musical chairs as they vie for the 
best seat. From doors on either side of the 
cafeteria, students file through the kitchen,

choosing from today's spoils: a chef salad 
of iceberg lettuce with sparing amounts 
of shredded carrots and purple cabbage, 
with chopped deli meats 
one lighter, 
one darker, both amorphous 
shredded 
cheese, and ranch dressing to add on top. 
At Wexler-Grant, salads don't fare well 
at lunchtime. Today,- many kids opt for 
the back-up option 
a cheese-and-un-
identified-meat sandwich. "My meat had 
black dots on it," one third grader reports 
to me, disgusted. ("That's the spice, stu-
pid!" his friend informs him.) Still more 
plates filled with dressed lettuce find their 
way quickly to the trash, as kids make do 
with canned fruit and precious cartons of 
chocolate milk. 

But salads are not the only foods that 
end up in the trash according to Louise 
Pierce, a self-proclaimed "Cafeteria Mom-
my," who has been working at Wexler-
Grant for two years. Wearing red pants 
and a matching turtleneck, Pierce patrols 
the cafeteria, selling out plastic silverware 
and fruit cups when the tide of students 
ebbs. When the kids enter with shouts of 
"Hi, Ms. Louise!" she monitors the meal, 
shushing the loudest voices and check-
ing in as they eat. If she knows anything, 
she knows what kids like 
and what they 
don't. "They waste more food than they 
eat. There was an eggplant parmesan sand-
wich that all went to waste. And an Asian 
chicken-broccoli stir-fry thing; it all went 
in the trash." 

The school lunch has been an Ameri-
can institution since 1946 when congress 
created the 
ational School Lunch Pro-
gram. Today, public and non-profit pri-
vate schools from pre-school through high 
school are eligible to receive federal reim-
bursement for the cost of the dining pro-
grams, and certain foodst11ffs are provided 
by the USDA. These reimbursements cov-
er the cost of students who qualify for a 
free lunch 
80% of students in 
ew Ha-
ven public schools 
but they do not add 
up to much. The USDA pays 
ew Haven 
$2.50 for every free meal they serve. The 
small sum is intended to cover the cost of 
overhead, personnel and ingredients for a 
healthy, filling lunch. 

"It's a whole giant mess the way the sys-
tem works," says ChefTimothy Cipriano, 
executive director of New Haven Food 
· Service Department. "$2.50 is supposed 
to cover the cost, which it doesn't." Since 
the inception of the National Lunch Pro-
gram, regulations have been periodically 
updated. Until now, this has meant inter-
mittent recommendations to cut fat con-
tent in meals or add vitamins. In October 
of 2009, the National Institute of Medi-
cine released its first new guidelines since 
1995, which featured limits on calorie and 
sodium content in the meals and require-
ments for more fruits and vegetables. The 
new recommendations have placed stress 
on the system. "We can't even afford what 
we serve now. If we were to implemen-r 
new recommendations, we'd be losing our 
shirts," Cipriano says. 

Bald and big-boned, Cipriano is on a 
mission when it comes to lunch. Some 
might say he has enough to focus on 
without new regulations that will increase 
his budget deficit. But he is a force to be 
reckoned with, even on the national -level. 
When we spoke, he had just returned from 
a trip to Washington, DC, where he was 
meeting with federal officials to convince 
the USDA to increase federal subsidies. 
Bur Cipriano is not your typical lunch
lady. Serving 12,000 meals per day is no 
meager task, but the chef took it on with 
gusto when he came to New Haven from 
Bloomfield, CT in July of 2008. "I never 
looked at it like it was a monumental task," 
he ·explains. "New Haven's school popula-
tion is ten times bigger than Bloomfield's, 
so I just multiplied it all by ten. I didn't 
want to psych myself out. I just never let 
it bother me." 

At Bloomfield, he was known for inno-
vative recipes and emphasis on local food. 
He brought Connecticut-grown produce 
into the high school cafeteria; the New 
York Times even profiled him for his work 
there. 

New Haven has been a different story. 
When he took over in 2008, Cipriano 
replaced Aramark, the massive food ser-
vices company that had managed New 
Haven's school food for years. Food ser-
vice companies like Aramark are the norm 
for school lunch throughout the country. 
"The vast majority of districts still rely on 
major food service companies," says Gor-
don Jenkins (YC '07) who now serves as 
the school lunch campaign manager at 
Slow Food USA, a non-profit food advo-
cacy group based in Brookyn. "But we're 
beginning to see a trend of districts head-
ing towards cooking from scratch." 

Cipriano is spearheading that transi-
tion in New Haven. "Everything was cor-
porate under Aramark, People were scared 
of upper management. I'm not going to 
be that bad guy." While it's true that the 
unions were sick of Aramark, he explains, 
the food itself was the main impetus for 
change. Now, instead of getting food de-
livered by a national chain, food services 
work out of a central kitchen where Cipri-
ano can control quality and order in bulk 
for better prices from regional sources. He 
offers more fruits and vegetables, salads, 
mashed potatoes (from real, roasted po-
tatoes 
not a box), working tirelessly to 
ensure that the ingredients are regional or 
local when possible. 

But Cipriano's vision is not always 
popular with the uniformed children who 
swarm the Wexler-Grant cafeteria in three 
shifts over the course of the morning. Kids 
wonder why they can't have chicken nug-
gets every day, while adults question the 
decisions behind the food. "We should 
have a hot lunch and mo~e variety, not just 
salad and bread in the winter," says "Caf-
eteria Mommy'' Pierce. "We have a state of 
the art kitchen in there and we only use it 
to reheat food? I'll go in there and cook." 

Beatrice has been working in the 
Wexler-Grant kitchen for 11 years. "They 
stopped people in the schools from cook-
ing. Now we're getting these meals 
some 
of them I can't even pronounce 
from a 
central kitchen. I mean, they say the food 
is good and healthy but I don't know," 
she says, shaking her head in dismay. "We 
stopped cooking and the kids throw it 
" 
away more. 

Cipriano claims the central kitchen al-
lows him to get the most bang for New 
Haven's buck; when it comes to procur-
ing high-quality local produce, ordering 
in bulk is the only answer. In 2008, New 
Haven purchased at least 12,000 apples, 
6,500 pounds of butternut squash and 
400 pounds of tomatoes. Meanwhile, the 
$2.50 benchmark looms over each deci-
sion. ''A central kitchen keeps the costs 
down, and I'm looking for any way to ex-
pend the government's dollar. It also gets 
the attention of regional suppliers," he ex-
plains. 

Since Aramark left, quality has im-
proved, 
believes 
"Cafeteria Mommy" 
Pierce, but she wonders whether that im-
provement is here to stay. "It started off 
better than Aramark, bur now to me, it 
seems to be going down." 

But are the school lunches in New Ha-
ven healthy? 
utrient content of school 
lunch food is closely regulated by the fed-
eral government. Schools have to meet cer-
tain criteria to receive any reimbursement 
for the lunch. But the rules state quotas for 
vitamins rather than fruits and vegetables, 
which can be filled by just about any forti-
fied food. This eases the budget issue for 
districts that are not focused on the nu-
tritional value of their lunches. "There are 
absolutely schools that make the budget 
work, but they serve tater tots, chicken 
nuggets and a lot of highly processed foods 
which is something we don't want to do," 
says Cipriano. 

Beatrice takes a look at the salad sit-
ting under the glass. "The board says it 
is healthy, but this is not good meat," she 
says, indicating the chopped, pink and 
white cubes that are spooned onto the mix 
of iceberg lettuce as the children grab their 
salads. 

"This is the healthiest thing I've seen 
them eat in a long time," says Elizabeth 
Bewley, a senior in Berkeley College who 
volunteers in a kindergarten classroom 
at Wexler-Grant. But are they eating it? 
"That's questionable," she laughs. 

After all, how many six year olds like 
salads? Adalia and Alandra, two kindergar-
teners, profess to like their lunch as they 
pick through their lettuce and meat. An-
other boy, taking a bite of his whole-:-wheat 
roll, expresses a common sentiment of the 
dining hall: "I only like this." While some 
kids clear their plates, most pick at one 
part of the salad or another. Some prefer 
the cheese, some the meat, others the let-
tuce. Either way, the trash cans are full of 
unfinished or untouched {ood by the end 
of each shift. 

As I move through the cafeteria, the 
pint-sized voices are dying to tell me that 
they love the pizza that appears on the 
menu once per week They don't seem to 
know it is made with whole grains, and if 
they do it doesn't bother them. There are 
also more elaborate dishes that are popular 
too. Barbeq ue chicken is a clear winner, 
with rave reviews from everyone from kids 
to teachers. 

What else would they like to see for 
lunch? 
"Fried Chicken!" 
"Chicken nuggets!" 
"D· 
. ,, 
trty nee. 
"Chinese food!" 
''At my cousin's school in Cheshire they 
even get jello!" 

Pleasing the palate while keeping the
food healthy is a tough balance in school 
lunches across the country. "You can't just 
offer healthy food and expect that's what 
the kids will want. It's all-about taste at the 
end of the day," says Slow Food's Jenkins. 

Taste can be a tricky thing, especially 
when cafeterias push kids out of their 
comfort zones. Walking past a chattering 
group of cafeteria. staff, I hear rumors of 
one school that accidentally got shrimp 
linguine for lunch one day ("I wish we had 
got shrimp linguine.") and concern about 
the quality of ingredients. "They always 
say there's vegetables in the pizza, but it's 
cooked to death!" says one employee who 
requests that her name not be used. "Ev-
eryone knows there's no nutritional value 
in that whatsoever." 

Health is hardly her biggest complaint, 
however. "There is no culture in the food. 
Look around, we're a largely minor-
ity school and we don't eat like that," she 
says, as she watches one of the lunch la-
dies scoop meat onto the salad. "They're 
not even thinking about the types of kids 
they're serving." Cipriano has expressed
interest in tailoring menus to reflect the 
rich ethnic communities of New Haven, 
but that will happen only in the years to 
come, he says. 

"The kids at Columbus love their salad 
bar. Last year at Martinez we were sam-
pling watermelon radishes and at Barnard 
they were handing me sungold tomatoes, 
excited to show me how delicious they 
were," he tells me. 

But Wexler-Grant has seen none of 
their innovations, and the discontent 
among the staff and students is palpable. 
Lunches at the school are prepared in a 
remote kitchen, have no face and no ad-
vocate. Cipriano wants to make cafeteria 
food in New Haven more personal, more 
interesting, and more genuinely healthy. 
But for true success, he'll have to figure 
out how to cook food that doesn't end up 
in the trash at schools like Wexler-Grant.
