Were the "About Us" page on the website of Harold's Formal Wear a wedding toast, the whole room would be tearing up.

MEET ANITA!!
Anita is "the face" of Harold's. If your mom or grandma bought their dress here at Harold's chances are Anita sold it to them.

ALICIA IS THE "LITTLE SISTER" of the family. . She's the girl next door. When you meet Alicia at Harold's you'll feel like you've been friends forever.

LISA CAME TO WORK at Harold's as a teenager and never left. "There are not many jobs in the world that let you be a part of the happiest day in someone's life. That's a pretty good perk!!"

ANNETTE JOINED HAROLD's with lots of experience dressing pretty girls ... She has three daughters, Dominique, Angela, and Marissa.

WHEN I FIRST MET Annette, she was testing out a mother-of-the-bride dress in front of the rest of the staff. It was a two-piece ensemble with a matching blazer, maroon, shiny, and bejeweled. Annette's not a fan of trying things on. "We all do it for Lisa," she says of her twin sister. "We're family."

Lisa is older than Annette by just a few minutes but shorter by quite a few inches. Though small, she is authoritative, with perky hair and a focused gaze. She wears heels, but trades catwalk delicacy for a determined, getting-somewhere clack that sounds with every step. As a young employee years ago, Lisa became quite close with Harold himself, and has gone on to run the shop after he passed.

The women cheer and Annette scowls. She shuffles back to the dressing room and rewrns wearing a silver taffeta ensemble. Annette stands in the silver dress as if it itches.

"You look good in anything, Annette," squeals Lee, another Harold's employee.

"You ass," Annette responds, smiles, and marches back to put on her jeans.

Lee remains beaming when her friend goes away. Though genetically unrelated to her co-workers, it's easy to see why the Harold's family adopted her. Her big lined eyes glow, and she has a voice that calls to mind secrets, counsel, and admiration all at once. Lee has well-styled blonde hair and wears clothes that Oprah would love: thick beaded necklaces, lots of muted tones and simple sweaters with flowing sleeves. Lee loves her job, and she's happy to tell you why.

"I think it's the relationship that you form with brides. You hope that they send you pictures; you become best friends. It makes you cry, there's such a deep connection. I get teary-eyed just saying it!" Her voice trembles.

The women laugh, moaning, "She's our crier!"

Lee is unashamed. "When I put a dress on a girl, I get the chills and teary eyes and if the mother cries, God forbid .... " There are nods all around.

ALLISON VALENTINE arrives at Harold's with her sister, Laura, and her mother, Susan. The three women wear matching Burberry jackets and dark, pressed jeans. They're instantly chatty with the staff. The traffic was bad. It took double the time they expected. And can you believe the rain? Annette receives them smilingly, and Lee asks them if they want to meet me, standing with a notebook in the corner.

Allison skips over to stand next to me. Her face is like a little girl's. Do I want to see her inspiration page? Not bothering to wait for an answer, she whips out a computer print-out hued in greens, yellows, and white, the color of Allison's treasured sunflowers. , The bridesmaids will wear emerald. But Allison will dress in white.

Pictures of Stewartesque table settings, unfrazzled wedding parties of sexy twentysomethings, and green high heels are arranged on the page like a yearbook collage.

As Allison leads her family towards the gowns, she points to a certain silk taffeta blend.

"But it's kind of prommish," Laura suggests. "So much Taffetyr''

"The fabric is kinda prommy," Allison concedes. The sisters leave the garment and move onto other, better dresses in different shades of white.


The dresses keep coming and coming off. The women have stamina, moving through dresses too big to wear, "too fun" or too expensive, even dresses deemed "perfect," yet discarded.

After some browsing, they're sent to the dressing room, where Annette has picked out some special gowns for Allison to try. The back room gowns are special; all priced at over eight-hundred dollars, they're accessible to patrons only at an employee's suggestion. After a brief interview with Allison about her "vision"

"I'll try anything," the bride-to-be admits

Annette has come back with a wide selection. The dressing room is so large it could fit three queen-sized beds inside. There's a pedestal, a wall-hugging couch, and a many-faced mirror that folds in and out. The lights can be switched to "evening" or "day." We keep it bright.

"She wants a nice shape," Susan declares upon seeing the selection. When I first met Allison's mother, she insisted she would play only supportive spectator to her daughters. Now, she explains to "her girls" (among whom I am now generously included) that the ideal dress would look like something Grace Kelly would wear -beautiful, elegant, classy.

Allison's face sprouts into a grin. With an honest "I'm not shy!" she slips off all her clothes and jumps into her first gown in front of the whole group. The dress has a deep back and a huge bottom. There's a rosebud pinned at the fabric stretched behind her hips. "You've got a flower on your butt!" Laura giggles, and Allison shimmies a little. "I've got enough junk in my trunk already," Allison says, rushing to unzip.

The next dress is ruched on the bottom in elegant "pick up" folds, the type of skirt Allison and Laura have taken to calling "the cupcake." It's bright white and regal.

"I feel holy in this dress," Allison remarks.

"Yea, that's too holy for you," Laura says. The dress is unzipped.

Allison puts on more dresses. Through it, Susan struggles to restrain herself.

"I don't love it," she says at one gown. "I want to love it."


It has been over an hour. The Valentines, luckily, have a year before the big day. They'll have a dress before the wedding. Allison's got an image in her head, and she'll find it. "When they find the right dress, their face lights up," Lee explains.

ANITA ANASTASIO is the shop's oldest employee, and has been working the wedding trade for forty years. Anita is a frail woman, short, wrinkle-faced and ruddy-cheeked. Her posture is bent just slightly, as if she is hoping to hug you, but a shade too timid to try. She spends conversation nodding and clasping her hands, resting her cheek in her palm, and sighing. Gazing back at memories of when she first came to Harold's, she speaks of the good old days. "It was different. It was quiet."

They used to have cookie tables after the wedding. They used to have special honeymoon outfits and the men wore fresh suits as they drove away. Everything was more ceremonial.

Despite these sepia memories, Anita is grounded in today's world. When she pauses to think back forty years, the shades of wistfulness she carries are outweighed by an accurate appraisal of "girls today." They've gained confidence. They simply know more about what they want -"the computer tells them so much" she explains. Internet or not, however, love remains blind, the heart stays fickle, and Anita assures me that "the basic bride stays the same. Her enthusiasm, her excitement, her fright is there no matter what." Anita insists that even modern-day professional women change when they become brides. Some are giddy and irrational. Others bask in the limelight. The wedding bug spares no woman.

When Anita began working at Harold's, the average girl got married when she was twenty-one years old. Today, women tie the knot, on average, when they're twenty-six. (Men, on average, are at least two years older than their wives.)

Anita knows that modern girls are different. She knows they've been shacked up with their fiancees since long before engagement. They're managing their money for themselves. They are gainfully employed. They're less likely to comply with their mother's vision of a perfect dress, or honor her by wearing the same one she wore.

"You can listen to the bride and take in what everyone else is saying to her, but she'll never feel beautiful in what I think and what her mother thinks is beautiful," she explains. To help a girl find a dress, you've got to let your feminine intuition take over as your inner fashion judge, because it's her day.

Anita and her partners speak so warmly of these moments, and so warmly to me, that I half expect them to invite me over for dinner. Instead, they invite me to the Bridal Extravaganza, where they're having the fashion show. It's at the Woodwinds, a social events space in Branford, and Annette will be modeling. I couldn't miss it.


THE WOODWINDS STANDS bricked and pillared, like a country club or a spa. It sits wreathed in a parking lot, dotted with three photogenic gazebos and embellished with red oaks.

I gain entrance with a postcard Lee had given me the week before: "TWO FREE ADMISSIONS: A TWENTY DOLLAR VALUE!" The paper is soft and ragged; I'd been clutching it nervously the whole taxi ride over.

Inside, I am greeted by a giant, estrogen pumped pageant. It is as though I've stepped into the mind of a woman who listened to soft rock and browsed bridal catalogs all day while eating cheese. A wedding singer and a little band had set up by the door, where they treated the crowds to "I'm Walking on Sunshine!" and other cheery hits. There are tables with cheddar and gouda cubes piled high next to cut vegetables. There are women everywhere. Some wear a tell-tale "BRIDE" sticker; to let the vendors know who among them would be the most lucrative to befriend.

One vendor, carrying an armful of roses, eagerly asks me if I am a bride-to-be. I show her my ticket, but inform her that no, I am not the bride. I get no rose. I walk past the flower-seller, make my way past the cheese sculptures and fruit bowls. My stomach is queasy.

A gaggle of bridesmaids linger by my side.
