Nirvana may be inaccessible, but this Zen Buddhist residence in New Haven is not. 

PETE DIGENNERO 路 CAN STILL remem-
ber when the venerable Maha Ghosanda 
of Cambodia paid a visit to his two-story, 
white-shuttered house on Mansfield Street 
in New Haven. "He was one of those 
people you meet and they just have light 
come out of them," he recalls. "He was 
like a big, huge sun." Digenerro lives in 
the oldest c:ontinuously operating center of 
the Kwan Urn School of Zen Buddhism, 
first founded by Zen Master Seung Sahn in 
Rhode Island in the 1970s and now prac-
ticed in chapters everywhere from Latvia 路 
to Israel. The New Haven Center's history 
is palpable to those who live and practice 
there. "You can really feel the presence of 
the house," Digenerro says. 

But when I first arrive at the Center on 
a dark, windy October night, it's tough to 
sense any presence, house or human. No 
one seerns to be around; my doorbell-
ringing goes unanswered for ten minutes. I 
know almost nothing about Zen, and even 
this setting seems mysterious: only a small 
paper sign posted inside a front window 
marks the blue house as my destination.

Getting closer, I read a weekly medita-
tion schedule and a phone number, but 
no other clues tell me what to expect when 
the door is finally answered by a barefoot 
man in loose sweatpants. He apologizes. 
It's difficult, he says, to hear the doorbell 
throughout the house. 

A golf course superintendent by day, 
Keith tells me he first carne across Zen 
Buddhism in 1991 in an undergraduate 
Religious Studies class. Not until years 
later, though, did he begin practicing Zen, 
coming to the realization shortly thereaf-
ter that doing so would be "the only way 
I was going to be happy." I am early for 
the meditation session, and he has time to 
show me around beforehand. 

The house balances meditation space-
the Dharma room, where a golden Buddha 
presides 
with living space. The shop-
ping list posted on the fridge downstairs 
supplements the staples of a healthy veg-
etarian diet with a few Eastern specialty 
items: miso, udon and soba noodles, as 
well as "ko chi chang," something so ob-
scure it doesn't even appear on Wikipedia. 

Above the fridge hangs a photo of a crowd 
of men and women, robed and smiling, 
underlined with the inscription: "Happy 
Holidays from the Kwan Urn School of 
Zen." Two huge bookcases in a living area 
contain works on spirituality from every 
branch of Buddhism and many world re-
ligions. One title reads, "Wanting Enlight-
enment is a BIG MISTAKE." On another 
shelf rests a signed photograph of a hockey 
player, inscribed: "To NHZC, Thanks for 
showing me the PATH!" Soft rugs cover 
dark wood floors, and rooms are lined with 
comfy couches. 

'1le was one of those people 
you meet and they just have 
light come out of them, , he re-
calls. '1le was like a big, huge 
,, 
sun. 

Meditation, though, takes place on the 
floor. My leg will likely fall asleep, Keith 

THE_NEWJO 

tells me, briefing me on Zen practice be-
fore the session. In that case, he says, I 
should bow and stand up without disrupt-
ing the room filled with about a dozen 
people in light-blue robes identical to the 
one I'm wearing now. "People think we're 
a little goofy with these things," Keith had 
said, 路laughing as he ties mine. The special 
square of cloth over Keith's robe indicates 
that he has completed training in the five 
basic precepts needed for membership in 
this school of Zen. 

As we enter, Keith demonstrates three 
of the four ways to cross your legs while 
meditating, leaving out the hardest one 
with the explanation, "Ifi were to take this 
leg and put it up here, it would break but 
that would be 路 full lotus." He tells me to 
stare at the floor in front of me and men-
tally repeat a mantra to get into "question 
mode." He suggests the words "clear head" 
as I inhale and "don't know" as I exhale, 
but I am free to choose something else: 
"You could do 'coca-cola' and it would be 
all right, as long as you meant it sincerely. 
The words aren't so important 
it's how 
you're holding your mind." 

Besides the technical details of sitting, 
Keith summarizes the story of Buddha and 
a few basic principles of Zen Buddhism, 
whose precepts boil down, he says, to "be-
ing a decent human being." As Ken Kes-
sel, the center's guiding teacher, will tell 
me later, the Korean words "Kwan Urn" 
-the bodhisattva in Buddism that the 
center is named after 
translate to "per-
ceive sound," and "perceiving the sound of 
the world draws you to-that sound," like 
a baby's cries draw its mother. Listening 
leads to compassion. But Kessel is quick to 
clarify that compassion isn't a goal to work 
toward; rather, compassion is "our original 
nature" 
roots that Zen practice can help 
us rediscover. Keith also emphasizes that 
the wisdom Zen practice brings must be 
used to help others: "This isn't the spiritual 
Olympics," he says. 

Thirty minutes of sitting and . doing 
nothing may sound simple enough, but 
Keith's words have left me a little ap-
prehensive. "We get a lot of people here 
wanting to chill out," he says. They think 
sitting will be easy. But, as Keith tells me, 
"it's really difficult. You're stuck with you." 

Others in the room will follow the first 
sitting with a brief interlude of "walking 
meditation" and then another full siuing 
session 
but as a beginner, Keith says, I 
0 
won't continue past thirty minutes. 

Sitting across from me are a couple of 
young men with ties visible above their 
robes. They look like grad students, maybe 
stressed-out, 
over-competitive 
medical 
students needing to relax 
the one on the 
left, with glasses, has a harried look about 
him. Next to them, a middle-aged man sits 
in a wooden chair; I guess he has a bad 
back or knees too weak to sit on the floor. 
Poor circulation, maybe. Brush paintings 
hang on the walls, and far to my right is 
the golden Buddha. It is customary, Keith 
told me, to bow when passing before it. 

uHe tells me to stare at the 
floor in front of me and men-
tally repeat a mantra to get 
into c'question mode. ~~He sug-
gests the words cclear head~~ as 
I inhale and caon't know" as I 
exhale~ but I am free to choose 
something else: ccYou could do 
coca-cola~ and it would be all 
right~ as long as you meant it 
sincerely. The words aren't so 
important 
you~re 
holding your mind. :1:1 

All the people here seem deeply fo-
cused, but what if someone looks up and 
makes eye contact with me? I concen-
trate on the floor. I memorize the grain 
of the wood and then try again to stop 
my thoughts. I breathe in and then out, 
a long sigh: don't knowwww. Clearhead 
dearhead dearhead, don't knowww. I feel 
pins-and-needles so I pull my leg out from 
under me 
and my mind wanders again. 

"The sitting is the key," Keith had said, and 
I feel a little guilty. 

Every few minutes, a bell rings and one 
of the experienced srudents leaves for an 
"interview" with Ken Kessel, the Center's 
guiding teacher. As a first-timer, I won't be 
called for an interview. I'm as relieved as 
I am intrigued. Viewed from the Dha rn1a 
room, the procedure seems a little eerie, as 
each srudent stands, bows, and exits the 
room soundlessly. Kessel lives in New Jer-
sey and comes into town monthly to con-
duct these interviews which consist largely 
of mind-puzzles called kong-ans: like what 
"the sound of one hand clapping" is. "The 
original kong-an," Kessel says is, "What 
are you; 

After the meditation, Pete tells me 
he first came to the center looking for "a 
spiritual home." We have put our medita-
tion robes away, and he has made himself 
a mugful of protein shake in the kitchen. 
Pete is now the cen!er's only full-time resi-
dent, but other students sometimes join 
him for his morning ritual, which begins 
with a 5:30am wake-up bell followed by 
bows, a chant, and finally, a sitting. Pete 
considers Zen practice everyday mainte-
nance, like tooth-brushing or gym-going, 
but even more crucial. "It's "part of my job 
on the planet," he says. In fact, he adds, 
ifhe stops practicing "it's just a matter of 
time before I misstep. It feels like a race, 
sometimes, between my dear mind and 
my discursive mind." Zen is powerful stuff. 

DURING A SECOND thirty-minute ses-
sion, sitting alone in the upstairs kitchen, I 
can hear sounds from the interview room. 
I'm surprised to hear mostly low chuckles 
and giggles from the students. The process 
had seemed utterly mysterious to me, but 
now one thing is dear: they're having fun 
in there. When I ask Kessel at the end of 
our talk if all the students have left, he 
says yes at first, and then corrects himself 
"Some people are sticking around to watch 
the World Series." I forget to ask if they're 
Yankee fans.
