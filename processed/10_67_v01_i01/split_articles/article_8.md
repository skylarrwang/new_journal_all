"the Vietnamese people live in an ex-
plosive situation, one in which peaceful-
ness does not meet the challenge of today's 
needs," and sent north of Saigon to camp. 
M's battalion was 
part of an inner circle, its radius a 
Herculean mile-and-a-half, spirals of 
barbed wire transfixed its perimeter, 
trip wires abounded, Charlie, beware 
of mines, and mighty artillery was 
zeroed in, super sabres and skyraiders 
knew the coordinates, in a sturdy sand-
bagged bunker Sullivan was to stand 
glaring at no-man's land through a 
curious slit, all the arsenal of America's 
genius at his fingertips, riftes, machine 
guns, recoilless riftes as long as 
howitzers, death rays, you name it, 
Sullivan would have it, atom bombs ... 
As the time neared for M's first opera-
tion to begin, and with it the end of Sack's 
Esquire assignment, the fear of the enemy 
and the ignorance of Vietnam of these 
over-armed adolescents took on an 
ominous tone. "Angels and miniSters of 
grace defend us," Sack bad written during 
M's basic training the first time actual 
shots were fired in a mock battle: 
Three thousand pieces of solid lead to 
be sent shrieking across America at 
four times the speed of sound, seventeen 
billion ergs of irresponsible energy in 
each satanical one of them, and each 
of them instantaneously activated at 
a ftick of an adolescent's finger. 
Merciful God! What cataclysmic threat 
to America's security could have mis-
led the Pentagon to such an insane 
experiment ... 
M was unconvinced by the Vietnik who 
cornered them in Oakland, as they 
journeyed to the front, and implored them 
to escape the army and "Read the New 
York Times/" Their belief instead, writes 
Sack, lay in "the principle of perpendicu-
lar geography, that article of American 
faith that all this world's sovereign coun-
tries stand on their ends and if one topples 
over the rest shall follow." But this, and 
moral justifications for the U.S. presence 
dissolve in the field, the point where, 
ironically, they no longer matter to 
committed men. 

For when M got to Vietnam, all ques-
tions of whether or not America should 
be ''there" became irrelevant; they were 
there, and they were to be protected from 
the Vietnamese at whatever cost, and sup-
ported at home: "Logic itself ... owed it 
to common courtesy to accommodate it-
self to M's life and limb." 

The absurdity of M in Vietnam comes 
full circle when two chubby Congressmen 
visit "the front," and whatever doubts 
may have existed in their minds about the 
Vietnam War "suffered a sea-change 
when the ethereal concept, the American 
commitment took on ftesh and bones and 
materialized in front of their watery eyes 
as M's noble soldiers." 

The last third of the book describes M's 
first operation. M scrambles out of heli-
copters into an empty field, lugging with it 
a vast assortment of weaponry and equip-
ment. The military euphemism dissolves. 
~en M was confused by firing in the 
diStance, for example, it was explained to 
them that it was "recon by fire" 
meaning that the wags in the cavalry 
had apparently ridden to some 
astonished Vietnamese village on their 
thirty-five thousand-pound horses and 
were firing into it with SO-calibre 
machine guns, the bullets as big as hot 
dogs, great big Oldenburg pop-art 
bullets, this being the cavalry's rip-
roaring way to ascertain if any com-
munists resided there--if so, they'd 
doubtless return fire. 

Mends with the surge of Varoujan 
Demirgian, the rebel of Fort Dix. While 
his friends are wounded, killed, or obtain 
safe positions at the rear, Demirgian 
survives, a fine fighting man, a specialist 4. 
On operations Demirgian guided his 
squad through the jungle, he gazed at 
the high yellow flames, he found the 
American army good. Without any 
qualms, he told himself, I'd like to burn 
the whole country down and start again 
with Americans. 

You may have gathered from all that, 
that John Sack is a Vietnik, and if you 
have you're wrong. At least, he wasn't 
when he wrote down M 's words in 
thirteen neat notebooks, indexed the first 
thirteen in a fourteenth in four different 
ways, and wrote his Esquire piece in the 
garden of a Saigon hotel, pausing now 
and then to pat the frail head of a peacock 
that wandered in and out. It wasn't till 
four months after he got back to the U.S. 
that he suddenly wondered what he would 
have done if he had been in M, and after 
a while he decided that, like Williams, 
be would have quit. And it wasn't until 
after that, when he read a piece in the 
New Yorker by a 22-year-old Harvard 
graduate named Jonathan Schell, about 
a V.C. village whose inhabitants were 
removed en masse for a government 
sponsored "New Life," that he decided the 
war made no sense. 

When Sack was off in the rice paddies, 
he had been "for" the war, or rather, be 
hadn't ever reaJly thought about the reason 
for the war, which makes him like the 
soldiers he chronicled, who, one would 
suppose, were somehow "for" the war, 
their fundamental purpose in Vietnam 
being to protect themselves. 

Sack could empathize with the guys 
because he was one of them, albeit a sharp 
and acid observer. Like theirs, his reaction 
to any unknown moving thing was to wish 
it shot. He understood them; he wrote 
honestly and they liked the book. The 
New American Library threw a party for 
Demirgian upon his return, and 
Demirgian loved the book; the book was 
true, he felt himself a hero. To date, Sack 
hasn't heard a single unhappy comment 
from the men of M concerning his por-
trayal of them, and the only Jetter he has 
received from the Army has been an ap-
proving one, of which more later. 

What then, does this ruthless book add 
up to? In Joseph HeJler's Catch 22, the 
war that drones on in the background "is a 
necessary war, as wars go. But the people 
are all in it for themselves, and so the 
whole thing becomes insane," says 
Sack. 

"I don't seeM that way. Here people 
are just doing the best they can, and they 
are corrupted by their surroundings, the 
role they have to play. My problem is 
insoluble, because everyone is doing 
what they really think is right." As Sack 
was writing, the war seemed necessary 
and so, he said, pacing the floor of his 
Manhattan apartment on whose walls 
hung color blow-ups of a hut on fire, and 
Demirgian peering in fear out of the 
helicopter as it landed for the first 
operation, "and so if logic means that the 
U.S. has to be burning villages, my God" 
-throwing his hands up, clutching his 
head. 

"Being there," he said ''you become 
aware of how insane the war is, but it's 
also very hard to be against it when the 
U.S. presence is so huge"-although the 
NLF, VC, what you wiU, seem to have had 
some success at just that-"it's such a 
monster thing. When you try to think in 
the middle of this, should we be here, 
should we get out, it's like being in a 
science class and wondering, should there 
be a Universe? And since the people there 
are all good people, and you can under-
stand the ones who are screwing up ... " 
and so on. 

"Then, once you get back in the States, 
Vietnam looks so small, why are we 
putting all those tanks and planes and 
guns in there, when the riots started and 
we couldn't fix up our own country, 
because we're throwing everything into 
that dump. It's insane." 

But then, in a way, Sack thrives on that 
insanity, laughter is his thing. "You know 
Mort Sahl's line," he will tell you, "it's 
good to be able to laugh at something, or 
else you might have to do something 
about it." 

Laughter is his natural reaction, even 
when M Company killed its little girl by 
mistake. "Perhaps," he says, pacing and 
flailing the air, "perhaps subconsciously, 
I'm horrified by it, and laughter is the only 
way I can keep sane ... to keep from 
screaming ... but it's an insane maniacal 
laughter, I get the feeling"-thinking 
now of the 45 bar crescendo in Sergeant 
Pepper, Sack, his arms outstretched, 
looking at me, up in the air, down on the 
floor-"You want to run up to these 
people in our government and say, what 
are you doing man, what are you doing?" 

What in fact is Sack doing? How can 
you choose when there are so many "good 
fellows" on our side, when it is so easy 
to empathize with the sinners in their 
midst? Sack couldn't, it's hard, we 
Westerners are all in on this show to-
gether, and so you end up with the luxury 
available to the disengaged and the "edu-
cated:" it's a mess, you can't make a 
choice; as Halberstam would call it, a 
quagmire. Sack can see ending operations 
that haven't worked, like the bombing 
of North Vietnam, but he doesn't like 
the idea of the U.S. leaving, just quitting, 
even after he has virtually demolished the 
rationale for the U.S. presence. 

An honest reporter writes about what he 
knows and understands best-in a sense, 
about what he is-and this is what Sack 
has done. There is an amorality vital to 
M's creation: Sack is an artist, and a deep 
commitment to either side would have 
killed the work. The aesthetic obsession 
with the events, the implicit acceptance of 
such a situation by not taking sides, is not 
peculiar to Sack; and it is an att.itude .th.at, 
if anything, helps the war cont!Due, 1t IS 
one level of intellectual sanction for 
business as usual. 

Sack's book goes to the heart of our 
"presence" in Vietnam. The flesh of the 
commitment is just folks, like you and me, 
less prone to intellectualize over things 
in general, but that makes no difference. 
Vietnam corrupts them in their role as 
freedom fighters, and the people of 
Vietnam bear their fear and fury. We 
ought to leave. 

The crowning triumph of the demon of 
M, is that we won't leave; the Asian 
climate alone doesn't make for make-
believe in Vietnam, which brings us to the 
letter from the army. It just so happened 
that someone over in the U.S. seventh 
division in Germany read John Sack's 
book, and thought it was neat. So the 
special forces wrote, requesting permis-
sion to adapt it for a stage play to be 
performed at troop bases all over; it 
would be funny entertainment, and it 
would "teach about training." To Sack's 
sorrow, his agent said no, John, we can't 
let them do this. The rights must be 
guarded. 

The war is no longer Sack's department, 
though an agency is sponsoring a series 
of lectures for him on just that (a dated 
brochure proclaims that he is "not 
preachy"). 

Sack has pinned down the contradiction 
that plagued him; now his head is some-
where else, he wants to chronicle the 
hippies. The temperament of the artist, 
perhaps, but also part of the grand old 
American ability, come whatever may, to 
have another drink.
