His Yale connections are very important 
to Lee, personally as well as politically. 
His dress and mannerisms reflect his Ivy 
League tutelage. The Mayor regularly gets 
his afternoon rubdown at the Payne-
Whitney gym, and Mory's is a frequent 
luncheon spot, as well as a regular location 
for political confabs. 

The relationship is not emphasized to 
the working people of New Haven-anti-
Yale sentiment is rife in town-but when 
he speaks to Yale groups, Lee likes to use 
phrases like "When I was at Yale ... " 

Most of Lee's numerous enthusiastic 
supporters-those in print range from 
Yale Divinity School Prof. William Lee 
Miller's embarrassingly panegyric The 
Fifteenth Ward and the Great Society to 
Talbot's more analytic The Mayor's Game 
-like to emphasize that Yale's support for 
Lee stems from his liberal social philo-
sophy. 

Talbot quotes former Law Sc~ool Dean 
Eugene V. Rostow as finding in the Mayor 
"a simple, yet intense moral purpose ... 
He was attacking fundamental ills of our 
time, the moral, economic, and social 
injustice of the slums." 

The relationship bas its more concrete, 
mutually advantageous aspects. Yale likes 
to be surrounded by a clean, bright, 
modern downtown area. A Yale education 
rests on an upper-class style of life and 
on the consideration of intellectual prob-
lems in isolation from the outside world. 
Yale's very architecture-forbidding stone 
walls, moats, heavy locked gates, and 
opulent, comfortable, self-contained in-
teriors-embodies this approach to 
education. 

Beginning in the early 1950's the Oak 
Street and Dixwell slums pushed tighter 
and tighter against the University; and 
Yale considered neither the slums nor the 
shabby downtown area proper neighbors. 

Mayor Lee's first redevelopment project 
dealt with part of this problem. When 
Oak Street, the city's worst slum, was torn 
down in the middle 1950's and replaced 
with the turnpike connector, a series of 
new office buildings and stores, and two 
of the most nondescript luxury apartment 
buildings anywhere-Madison and Uni-
versity Towers-Yale thus had its most 
discomfiting neighbor excised. 

The downtown renewal project finished 
that part of the job by installing Malley's, 
Macy's, a new bank, Paul Rudolph's park-
ing lot, and finally, after several years as 
a giant hole in the ground, the new Chapel 
Square shopping mall. 

Two more projects now on the drawing 
boards, one Yale's and the other the city's, 
will complete the encirclement of the Uni-
versity by an environment acceptable 
to it. 

The Mellon Art Gallery will take care 
of a pesky block of small stores and 
~partments along Chapel. The projected 
mner loop road wilt effectively isolate 
Yale from Dixwell and the rapidly ex-
panding black population in the Dwight 
neighborhood across Howe Street. It will 
also save the Medical School from the 
blacks and Puerto Ricans in the Hill. 

This loop, part expressway and part 
boulevard, will start from the 1-91 Trum-
bull Street exit, an engineering disaster, 
circle behind the Grove Street Cemetery 
and Payne-Whitney and go down Howe 
and Dwight to the turnpike connector, 
which is being extended, and then circle 
beyond the medical 5chool-bospital 
~mplex and join State Street, by then a 
SIX-lane road. 

To please Yale, which does not want 
Vassar's proposed Prospect Street site and 
the science complex to be cut off from 
the rest of the University, Lee has made 
a tentative agreement with Brewster to 
bury the Trumbull Street section of the 
loop underground. 

Another of the many instances of 
mutually beneficial cooperation between 
Yale and the Mayor is Yale's $3 million 
purchase of the old Hillbouse and Board-
man Commercial high schools, now the 
site of Morse and Stiles, in 1955 for a 
price much higher than market value. Lee 
got money needed for working capital; 
the large profit margin, and the city's free 
use of the schools until1958, helped 
overcome political opposition to the sale. 

Another piece of cooperation is in the 
offing if Vassar comes to New Haven and 
locates, as projected, on Prospect Street. 
Upper Winchester Avenue and Newhall 
Street, below Prospect Hill, are rapidly 
becoming serious slum areas, and Vassar 
wiU not tolerate a ghetto next to it. An 
employee of the Redevelopment Agency 
says that the area will be "cleaned out." 

Yale gains from its cooperation with 
the Mayor, then, by insuring the kind of 
clean, undisturbed surroundings it re-
quires for its methods of training the 
nation's leaders. 

The Lee administration has also given 
many Yale people the chance to dabble 
in local politics-examples are Law 
School Dean Louis Pollack on the Board 
of Education and University Secretary 
Reuben Holden as president of the board 
of CPl. 

Yale has generously repaid the Mayor 
for his help. The University's local politi-
cal and economic power are enormous, 
and both are solidly behind the Lee ad-
ministration. Yale has consistently 
bestowed upon Lee official praise and 
recognition. 

Yale faculty bas been an important 
resource for the Mayor for expertise, free 
advice, and image-building publicity. A lot 
of valuable publicity has also been 
generated for New Haven by Yale's 
practice of hiring famous architects to 
design its new buildings. 

In marked contrast to Yale, the banks 
and big businesses were slow in recog-
nizing Lee's value. Many influential 
businessmen viewed him for several years 
as a threat; all have now accepted him as a 
phenomenon here to stay, and most are 
enthusiastic supporters of his programs. 

To overcome business animosity, Lee 
first had to demonstrate to the retailers 
that a downtown location was ultimately 
more profitable than fleeing to the suburbs. 
The middle and upper classes, Lee argued, 
would shop downtown and eventually 
live there when his redevelopment 
program had done its job. The convincing 
wasn't easy, but Lee did it. For instance, 
when the Mayor decided to announce 
plans for the Church Street South project 
(the vacant land in front of the railroad 
station), he did it in a speech to the 
Chamber of Commerce. The 800-plus 
housing units there, he said, would be at 
least 90 percent middle-income and 
luxury housing; this would constitute a 
"captive market" for the new downtown 
shopping area. 

But it took the big businesses some time 
to come around. The man who helped Lee 
win the argument was Roger L. Stevens, 
who in addition to making an immense 
amount of money from real estate, also 
produces Broadway plays and contributes 
heavily to the national Democratic 
Party. He is President Johnson's adviser 
on the arts, and chairman of all sorts of 
national councils on the arts. The most 
legendary of Stevens' grandiose financial 
moves was in 1951, when be bought and 
sold the Empire State Building. 

Mayor Lee's redevelopment program is 
creating an area known as "University Park 
Dixwell" on Dixwell A venue, the city's oldest 
black neighborhood. The scene below which 
used to be the corner of Dixwell and Gregory 
Street, is typical of the houses low-income 
blacks lived in before redevelopment tore 
them down . .At bottom, is One Dixwell Plaw, 
which replaced some of the slums . .A one-
bedroom apartment in this project costs 
$139 per month. 

81 The New Journal I October 15, 1967 
Lee and Logue got Stevens to become 
the financier for the original four-block 
downtown commercial redevelopment. 
The obstacles were numerous. 

The small businessmen there were 
overwhelmed without too much difficulty, 
but the big problem was getting the big 
businesses in. 

Malley's, an old New Haven family 
firm, was convinced to buy into the new 
project. The real turning point, however, 
was when Macy's agreed to come to town; 
and once again Yale helped out. 

In 1962 the University lent Stevens 
$4.5 million for short-term financing. 
J. Richardson Dilworth, financial adviser 
to the Rockefellers, was on the Yale 
Corporation when the loan was approved. 
He was also on the board of Macy's, and 
a chain of events that began with a Dil-
worth-Lee meeting at Mory's culminated 
when Macy's agreed to build a $5 million 
store in downtown New Haven. Macy's 
arrival broke the back of local big 
business opposition to Lee's programs. 

Charles Abrams, in his book The City 
is the Frontier, explains in some detail 
how urban renewal enabling legislation-
which with a little gerrymandering the 
downtown project became eligible for-
guarantees large profits for big construc-
tions companies and lending institutions. 

Retailers, money-lending banks and 
insurance companies, and construction 
and real-estate interests all began to 
understand their opportunity. A whole 
new field for investment opened up to 
them--or would if they became Demo-
cratic Party backers. 

Fusco-Amatruda, for instance, a huge 
construction company based in New 
Haven, became the developer for the 
Chapel Square shopping mall; and Arthur 
Barbieri, the Democratic Town Chairman, 
landed the Chapel Square rental agents 
job for his real estate company. 

It is since 1961, when he came the 
closest to losing an election, that Mayor 
Lee has demonstrated to the corporations 
that he is right: there is big money to be 
made in his urban renewal program. 

It is also since 1961 that the Democratic 
Party has demolished the Republicans in 
New Haven. In 1965 Lee pulled down 
the largest victory margin ever for a 
New Haven Mayor. And the Republicans 
can't seem to raise any money for this 
fall's mayoralty election. 

With Yale and the big business support, 
the Democratic Party now runs New 
Haven-but it is not the same Democratic 
Party that captured the mayoralty for Dick 
Lee 14 years ago. 

The Mayor is fond of saying that when 
he and his Kremlin started, they didn't 
know where they were going or how they 
were going to get there-just that they 
wanted to rebuild their city. 

It is clear that Lee had no idea what his 
Democratic Party would look like after 
14 years of his administration. It is not 
true that he set out on his renewal pro-
gram simply to solidify his political power; 
power, of course, is important to him, 
but equally important is his belief that 
he is rebuilding New Haven. 

This drive for the "new New Haven" 
began with the redevolpment program in 
1953. 

After nine years of what the city calls 
"physical renewal," Lee decided that only 
half the job was being done. The result 
was $2.5 million from the Ford Founda-
tion in 1962 to start Community Progress, 
Inc., the city's anti-poverty program. 

Once again, New Haven pioneered; when 
the Federal government opened the Office 
of Economic Opportunity in 1964, many 
of its initial programs were modeled on 
CPI's experience. Today the Federal 
government provides over 80 percent of 
CPI's $6 million-plus annual budget. CPI, 
Lee says, does the job physical renewal 
neglects: "human renewal." 

In both of these programs, "coalition" 
is the key word. Lee's approach is the most 
comprehensive attempt in the United 
States to implement the basic liberal theory 
of change: that those in power will use 
their power to significantly improve the 
lot of the disadvantaged, once they are 
made aware that it is in their self-interest 
to do so. 

At bottom is the assumption that the 
entire community, rich or poor, black 
or white, shares a common interest. 

Fourteen years of redevelopment have 
yet to prove that this is true. The face of 
New Haven is being dramatically changed, 
but the corporations have changed it by 
building the things business finds profit-
. able or necessary: big stores, expressways 
and parking lots that service these stores, 
office buildings, a hotel, and middle-
income and luxury housing. 

All of these projects are money-makers. 
Only one kind of construction is seriously 
needed in the city that is not profitable: 
low-income housing. 

The poor people have simply been 
moved from place to place. When Lee and 
his Kremlin tore down the Oak Street 
slum, most of its white residents headed 
for Fair Haven or Wooster Square and 
the blacks went to Dixwell. 

Redevelopment followed them to 
Wooster Square and Dixwell, and it is on 
its way to the Hill, Fair Haven, and 
Newhallville. The extension of the turn-
pike connector is taking care of the 
Legion Ave. area, perhaps the worst slum 
pocket in the city. 

Because discrimination in housing is 
still widespread and blatant, the problems 
for blacks and Puerto Ricans have intensi-
fied. The non-white population has nearly 
doubled since 1960, from about 20 percent 
to an estimated 35 per cent this year. 

Redevelopment Agency figures say that 
the city has relocated 6776 households, 
4785 of them since 1960. This figure does 
not include families who don't wait for 
the Relocation Agency, but move out 
when they hear the bulldozers are on their 
way. 

Of those families relocated since 1960, 
2076 have been white and 1794 black; 
this means that, by the Redevelopment 
Agency's own admission, less than five 
per cent of the city's white people but 
almost 30 per cent of the blacks have been 
moved. A Yale planning student's study, 
based on 1965 figures, calculated that 40 
per cent of the total Negro population bad 
been relocated. 

What was built for these people? In 
mid-1965 redevelopment had erected 
1676 housing units; 700 were luxury 
apartments and 976 were middle-income. 
More in those categories have been 
opened since 1965. A low-income public 
housing project with about 25 units is 
about to open in Fair Haven, and about 
100 other poor families have received 
rent supplements. 

Beyond that, nothing has been done 
since the big housing public projects were 
built in the late 1940's and early 'SO's 
except some housing for the elderly; only 
token numbers of low-cost units are even 
on the drawing boards. 

The attempt to relocate tenants from 
the path of Route 34, the turnpike con-
nector extension, points up the seriousness 
of the housing crisis for low-income 
families particularly blacks. The Legion 
A venue area is being torn down for this 
road, which will be one of the widest roads 
in the world, with six lanes of traffic, an 
immense grassy median strip, and a wide 
bank on either side-even though it 
runs through the middle of the city. 

This neighborhood bas the biggest 
concentration in New Haven of large 
families on welfare. The State Highway 
Department, which is building the road, 
had hoped that relocation could be 
finished by this fall so construction could 
start, but over one-half of the families are 
still there even though the state now 
owns all the properties. 

The buildings are falling to pieces; the 
first week of October saw two major 
fires in these apartments. Relocation 
officials admit in private that there is just 
no place to put these families. A top 
official of the State Welfare Department 
said in Hartford last year that some large 
welfare families have already bad to move 
out of New Haven because there is no 
place for them to live. 

It is clear that the interests of the poor 
have not been properly represented in the 
redevelopment program. CPI, some 
people hoped before they saw it in action, 
would overcome this problem by organiz-
ing the people to make their needs known. 

Allan Talbot claims in The Mayor's 
Game that a new political force-"direct 
citizen action"-is at work in the city. 
CPI, Talbot says, has "played key behind-
the-scenes roles in most of the recent 
stir and action." In its first four years, 
according to this analysis, CPI invested 
$1,639,574 in "neighborhood organiza-
tion." 

The bulk of this "neighborhood 
organization" money in fact went for 
the CPI neighborhood offices, which in 
no sense organize neighborhoods. CPI is 
a very tightly administered, top-down 
organization, with every major decision 
made by the executive staff and the Mayor. 
The neighborhood offices simply carry 
out the directives from downtown. What 
little community organization CPI in-
dulges in has been designed to create 
pressure for goals selected in advance by 
the CPI staff. 

CPI, like the development program, is 
a coalition of those in the community 
who already have power. These power 
groups do not believe that those who 
dominate society are responsible for the 
depressed condition of the poor and the 
blacks; implicit in their programs is the 
assumption that the poor are where they 
are because something is wrong with 
them, whether it be lack of education, 
poor motivation, or something else. 

The CPI approach denies that power-
lessness is an important factor in the 
ghettoes; and it denies, by its top-down 
control and its predominantly white 
middle-class policy makers, that the poor 
ought to have an important voice in 
programs designed to help them. 

Some individuals have been able to 
begin the climb out of poverty with CPI 
help, but the organization will never 
significanty affect large groups so long as 
it tries to pull individuals out and up 
rather than mobilizing the masses of the 
poor in their own behalf. 

Maurice Sykes, a black CPI neighbor-
hood worker, put the problem succinctly 
last month: CPI, be said, has "done a 
helluva job, but they overlooked the 
grass roots." 

All of Mayor Lee's vaunted programs 
overlook the fact that the economic struc-
ture of the United States has always 
rested on an underclass. Previous im-
migrant groups have been able to rise 
in the society only because they were 
replaced by another group of immigrants. 
. In this way the Italians replaced the 
Insh as the lower class in urban industrial 
centers, and as the blacks and Puerto
