Dumaran 
DAVID MILCH, a first year law student, 
began his unfinished novel The Ground-
lings two years ago for an honors English 
major in Yale College. "Dumaran" is a 
chapter from that novel. It introduces the 
eldest of the three brothers, Torch, who is 
on his way home for the funeral of his 
youngest brother, Judge. "Dumaran"

Torch had received the call from Ithaca 
a little before three in the morning, 
Pacific Time. He had managed to reach the 
phone before its ringing awakened his wife 
Sue, and had talked in a low voice, that 
she might remain asleep. He had, on one 
occasion, engaged in a rather loud 
exchange with his brother, but had shut the 
bedroom door as he did so. 

After he had replaced the receiver 
Torch walked slowly into the kitchen. He 
put a kettle of water on the stove, and 
measured a teaspoon and a half of instant 
coffee into each of two cups he had placed 
on a black plastic tray. Then he stood with 
his head lowered, hands straddling the 
sides of the stove, waiting for the water 
to boil. After a few moments steam began 
to rise from the kettle's spigot, and he 
breathed it deep, eyes closed. Some time 
passed before he finally pushed away, 
afterwards filling the cups with the boiling 
water as he stirred just less than a spoonful 
of sugar into one of them. Then, pushing 
the door open with his hip, he carried the 
tray into the bedroom, softly setting it 
down on his wife's night-stand. He stared 
at her for a long moment before quietly 
seating himself on the bed, then touching 
his hand to her cheek, palm up. 

"Suzabelle," in a whispered voice. 
"Su-hu-zabel." She stirred uneasily. He 
leaned over and kissed her, staring at the 
wall behind the bed. She shrugged lazily, 
eyes closed, and smiled, lifting her arms to 
him. He moved just out of their reach. She 
opened her eyes. 

He nodded toward the night-stand. 
"Soup's on." 

She sat up quickJy and looked around 
the room, pushing a strand of hair from 
her face. "What time is it?" 

"A little past three. Sugar's the one 
nearest you." 

She looked toward the table. "Torchy?" 

"C'mon." He took the cup from the tray 
and handed it to her. 

"No, Torchy?" 

In the darkness he stared at the wall 
behind her. "Drinkee all down. Grow big 
and strong." 

She did move for a moment, then, still 
looking at him, picked up the cup and 
took a tentative sip. "Oooh." 

"Good huh? See first you take your 
water ... " 

She stared at him. 

He took the cup from her and reptaced 
it on the table. "Hey, Susie? Hold my 
hand. C'mon, squeeze now. Squeeze." 

Tears began to fill in her eyes as she 
pressed his hand. "Judgy ... C'mon, hard 
now. Judgy's dead. Mark just called to 
tell me. C'mon duke. He said there'd been 
this car wreck- ... That's all. He said 
he was dead. C'mon duke, squeeze." 

"Judgy?" 

"Okay duke. It's all right." 

"Oh. Oh. Judgy?" 

"Okay now. Shhh. Okay." He took her 
in his arms, pressing her toward him, and 
began to rock gently. "Shhh. It's okay." 

"Oh my. Ob my." 

"Say his name Susie. C'mon, soft now. 
Just his name now." 

She said the name quietly, in a very 
high voice, separating its syllables. 

"No questions duke. Over and over now. 
Just ... " 

"No. Dear Lord. Please not Judgy." She 
pushed away from him and buried her 
head in the pillow, sobbing that he 
couldn't be, dear lord, dear lord. 

"No, just the name honey. It's over. 
C'mon now." He turned his hand to the 
left, to the windowless wall, softly 
drumming his fingers on the iron frame 
of the bed. "Hey Susie, don't. C'mon 
honey.'; She continued to cry, and said 
that it was not fair, that she had rather it 
would have been her, that nothing could 
be less fair, of all people. He watched her 
for a moment more, then rose and walked 
away, into the bathroom. 

He ran the shower, pushing the door 
shut with his foot, then turned and stared 
at his expressionless face in the mi.rror 
above the sink. Slowly, he removed his 
pajamas and got into the shower, standing 
with his mouth open as the hot water hit 
him. (The water pushed his long red hair 
over his face, into his eyes.) He did not 
lather, just stood so for five minutes, his 
arms raised slightly above his head, 
pressing against the wall on one side and 
the steel rod of the shower curtain on the 
other. When this time had passed he 
leaned forward, his weight on his right 
leg, and after a brief hesitation, shut the 
shower off. He wound a bath towel around 
his mid.section without drying himself 
and opened the door, walking to her side 
of the bed. He stood before her, dripping 
wet, his hair completely covering his eyes. 

She had been lying in bed, silent for 
some time now, but tears still showed on 
her cheeks. She looked up at him, and 
smiled, taking a deep, shuddering breath. 

He asked, very quietly, head tilted far 
back, whether she was new in town. She 
tried to speak once, could not, then finally 
said it so happened she was, why didn't 
he buy her a drink, in a very weak voice. 

He lay down beside her, his head on her 
breast, with the wall opposite the window 
before him. After a moment's silence he 
said, "Okay?" 

Her hair made a rubbing noise on the 
pillow as she nodded. 

"Was that an up and downer or a side to 
side?" 

She took his ears and moved his head up 
and down, pushing her chin out as the 
corners of her lips began to tremble. 

"Sure?" 

She nodded again, turning her head on 
the pillow as the tears ran slowly down 
her cheeks. 

He rose, then lowered himself to one 
knee beside the bed. 

Â· 
She looked up quickJy. 

"Don't say anything for a minute 
Susie. No.'' He reached beneath the bed 
and pulled out a small suitcase, then went 
to the dresser and removed a notebook, 
three pairs of khaki pants and five white 
shirts. He walked to the closet and took 
out his two suits, a black and a patterned 
grey, and a herringbone jacket. He laid 
the suits beside the bag and began to dress. 

As be had spoken she had slowly 
reclined again, and turned her head to the 
window. "Torchy .. .'' 

He walked into the bathroom, brushed 
his teeth, then placed the brush and 
toothpaste in his shaving kit and brought 
it with him into the bedroom. He packed 
it in the side pocket of the suitcase, along 
with the notebook. 

''Torchy? Look at me?" 

He finished dressing and zipped up the 
suitcase before walking to her side of the 
bed. He raised his hand to her chin, then 
moved it along her neck and shoulder. "In 
a few days duke. It's all right." 

"No, Torchy?" Her voice bad grown 
weaker. "I'm all right." 

"As soon as ... " 

"I won't get upset. I won't ... I'll help 
your mom with the beds and cooking, 
that's all. I'll be perfectly ... I won't be 
upset. I'll just help around the house." 

"Honey ... " 

"Torchy, I can't stay here." 

He kissed her shoulder next to where his 
hand had stopped. "Susie, it'll just be a 
few days. You can fly in for the funeral." 

He went to the front of the bed and picked

up his bag and suits. "Blas'll give me a 
ride to the airport. I'll call you when I get 
in okay?" 

"Torchy, let me. Please?" 

He put on his trench-coat and walked to 
the front door. "In a little while. It's all 
right." 

"No Torchy, I'm going with you. I'm 
fine. I'm going with you." She got out of 
bed, extending the last word into a long 
sob, and pursued him to the front door. 

"Oh your hair's not even combed. 
Torchy ... " 

He turned five steps out the door. 
"Hey." 

She stopped. 

"Now don't come Susie." 

. 
"Oh please. I can't, oh let me ... " 

"Now shut it." He stared at her for a 
moment, then turned and walked away, 
pausing only briefly as he heard the door 
close quietly behind him. 

Torch arrived at the Los Angeles 
International Airport at a quarter before 
six, having gotten a ride with Mr. Bias, 
supervisor of the program in Spanish at 
the Peace Corps Training Center. As 
Torch got out of the car Mr. Bias offered 
to help him with his luggage, but he 
declined, saying that Mr: Bias could do 
him a favor though if he would be kind 
enough to look in on his wife now and 
again over the next few days. Mr. Bias 
said of course he would, and reaffirmed the 
sympathy he had expressed throughout 
the trip, and Torch walked away. 

He checked in at the American Airlines 
Military Personnel counter, presented his 
Peace Corps identification card, and asked 
for a roundtrip ticket to Buffalo at military 
rates. The ticket agent told him that she 
was sorry, those rates were applicable to 
Peace Corps volunteers only on flights to 
or between points of service, or in cases 
of family emergency. He half-smiled and 
replied that he made it, he made it on 
the last count, and gave her the phone 
number of the police station in Ithaca. 

She began to make out the tickets as she 
placed a collect call to Ithaca, where she 
received confirmation of a family 
emergency from Desk Lieutenant Carlson. 
After checking the flight schedule she 
hurriedly placed another call, her back 
to him, then turned as she hung up and told 
Torch he could depart immediately on the 
6 A.M. flight to Chicago, and could make 
connections for Buffalo there. Torch 
paid for the tickets and thanked her, 
moving toward the gate she had indicated. 

She called after him that she was sorry, 
and that she had gotten them to hold the 
plane. He stopped, smiled, and thanked 
her again, then turned and walked away. 

A stewardess was waiting for him at the 
gate, asking as he approached if he were 
Mr. Little. After his reply she said that 
she was very sorry to hear of the death in 
his family, and that American would try 
to make his flight a comfortable one. She 
escorted him on to the plane, excused 
herself for a moment, then returned and 
asked him to follow her please. She took 
him to an aisle seat just being vacated by 
another passenger, a blond boy, about 
five, and said that Torch's seat would be 
number Three C, and that his fellow 
traveler would be Father Tyres. The priest 
rose reluctantly, squinting at Torch, and 
offered his band. Torch shook hands with 
him, smiling, and thanked the stewardess 
over his shoulder for her consideration. 

The first three and a half hours of the 
flight passed without incident. The priest 
had excused himself shortly after take-off, 
and remained in the lounge during the 
whole period, while Torch occupied 
himself with writing in the notebook be 
bad taken from his suitcase. On a number 
of occasions he glanced over at the 
passenger he had displaced. The boy was 
now sitting alone, in the window seat 
across the aisle from Torch: He bad not 
taken his eyes from the window since 
take-off, and had refused the stewardess' 
repeated offers of breakfast with silent 
though unemphatic shakes of his head. 

When the plane was within two hundred 
miles of Chicago the pilot announced that 
they were now flying a holding pattern, 
they had been advised by O'Hare that a 
storm system had developed which pres-
ently extended from Boston across to 
Chicago and into the Dakotas, and that 
they would maintain this pattern until re-
ceiving further instructions from O'Hare. 

After the captain's announcement 
Torch placed the notebook under the seat, 
and after looking quickly toward the boy, 
who had not visibly responded to the 
announcement, stared absently at the 
"no-smoking, fasten seat-belt" sign which 
was flashing erratically in the front of the 
cabin. The priest, who had just left the 
lounge, walked unsteadily back to his seat. 
Torch rose silently to let him in. The 
process took a few moments, as he stared 
at Torch for some time before recognizing 
the vacant seat next to him as his. When 
he had seated himself the priest, a bald 
man, strikingly thin, made a perfunctory 
effort at reading the American Airlines 
travel book, but discarded it. After a brief 
pause, he nudged Torch confidentially 
and asked in a thick voice if he had a 
cigarette. 

Torch looked over at the boy, then, 
staring straight ahead, spoke loudly to 
the priest out of the side of his mouth. 
"Think we can pull it off?" 

The priest looked around the cabin. 
"Pull it off?" 

"The no-smoking sign." 

"Oh, oh, sure," The priest winked 
elaborately, and began to whistle. "In 
there," he muttered between his teeth, 
nodding at the sickness bag. "Put 'em in 
there." 

Torch winked back, picked up the bag, 
and slipped a Phillip Morris into it. Then 
he too started to whistle, dropping the 
bag at the priest's feet. Torch looked over 
at the boy, who had turned when he heard 
the priest's whistling, and put a finger to 
his lips, pointing to the no-smoking sign 
with his other hand. The boy smiled. 

The priest accepted Torch's offered 
light, guiding the match to the end of the 
cigarette with a shaking hand. "Why is it 
they put the no-smoking sign on the only 
times you want to smoke?" 

Torch had been flashing an "OK" signal 
to the boy across the aisle. "Excuse ... 
Oh, I think the thing's busted anyway." 

The light was no longer flashing, but 
shone a dull orange, emitting a loud, 
buzzing noise. 

"Well there is an irony. There is an 
ironic note. You mean we went through 
all that for nothing?" 

"I guess." 

"Of course we may be grateful it bas a 
light to begin with. We may be ... " The 
priest took Torch's elbow, moving his head 
closer to him. "My son, I have ridden on 
planes, I have travelled on planes ... You 
think this is a bad plane? You should take 
the Islands Service planes sometime. 
Before making your final judgement, you 
should ... Like this." He held onto the 
imaginary handle-bars, pedalling 
furiously. "Two little pinos where the 
engines should be." Torch smiled absently, 
and looked back toward the boy, but the 
priest shook his arm and said "Hey, like 
this," and began to pedal again. 

Torch turned back to him, a little un-
easily. "Is that right?" 

"Yes sir. Yes sir." The priest squinted at 
Torch, smiling. Torch did not reply, and 
after a moment the priest's smile faded. 
He began to tap his knee with the palm of 
his right hand. "Yes sir, I have ridden the 
Islands Service planes many times, many 
times. To and from Dumaran. In and 
around the general vicinity of Dumaran. 
Dumaran ... Do you know where 
Â· Dumaran is?" 

Torch had been looking across the aisle, 
watching as the boy resumed his former 
posture, his head to the window. "Excuse 
me?" 

"I said do you know where Dumaran 
is?" 

"Uh, the Philippines." 

The priest stared at Torch. "Hey, how'd 
you know where Dumaran is ... ?" 

"I'm going to the Philippines in a little 
while for the Peace Corps. My wife and 
1." 

"Dumaran? Are you going to 
Dumaran?" 

"No, I think we're going to be on the 
main island." Torch still seemed pre-
occupied with the boy, and did not look at 
the priest as he spoke. 

The priest shook his elbow. "Say, don't 
go to Dumaran. You can listen to me. The 
disease on ... It's filthy and it's hot and 
... it's just a bad place. Dumaran, if you 
ever want to believe in an angry God, go 
to Dumaran. I spent ... Even if they try 
to force you. Even if they insist, and try 
to justify your going there, tell them you 
.refuse, under any circumstances." 

Torch finally turned to him and 
attempted another smile. "Okay. Dumaran 
is out." 

"Right. Don't go to Dumaran." 

"Not even for a visit. Okay." 

"Ob, you can't visit. They won't . 
Right. Not for a day, not for an hour, not 
for a minute. Dumaran is ... God's 
wrath." 

The pilot announced that they expected 
word from O'Hare shortly. Torch looked 
over at the boy, then turned in his seat 
and signalled for the stewardess, but 
could not get her attention. The priest 
shook his elbow, and Torch wheeled 
quickly, frowning. "Look ... " 

"You won't go to Dumaran?" 

His features relaxed. "No. I, ub, 
promise." He looked for the stewardess 
again, and half-rose as he saw her enter 
the pilot's cabin. But the priest's insistent 
hold on his elbow restrained him, and he 
seated himself, gently loosening the older 
man's grip. 

The priest reclined in his seat. "Of 
course I need oo longer concern myself 
with affairs on Dumaran. I need not ... I 
am being, as we say in the priest game, 
recalled. I am being, I am considered ... 
unfit, for further proselytizing activities, 
by virtue, by the cardinal ... and papal 
virtue, of my constant inebriation ... and 
other failings." 

Torch shifted in his seat. 

"Not a bit. Not a bit of it. I had my 
doubts, twenty-two, no, now it's twenty-
four years ago, about the cloth. Concern-
ing my vestments. And ... my doubts are 
now confirmed. I am ... unfit, to 
proselytize any further, I am ... unfit. I 
am going backÂ· to Chicago to loose my 
robes. To have my robes loosed for me." 

He imitated a ripping movement on his 
sleeve. "Off with my stripes. Off ... And 
then I am going to walk, feel my way, to 
the waterfront, and dive ... for pearls. In 
Lake Michigan." 

The pilot asked for the passengers' 
attention. He said now they bad just 
received word from O'Hare that minimum 
ceiling was not now and could not be 
expected to become available for some 
time. Existing weather patterns made 
flight to any southem or due eastern city
