Kenneth Haigh: Actor 
Kenneth Haigh: Director 
By Daniel Yergin 
The time was May of 1956; the place was 
the Royal Court Theater; and the event, 
the premier of a play that has since 
been said to hold the same importance 
to the modern theater as the assassination 
of the Archduke in 1914 does to the 
history of World War I. 

With the premier of Look Back in 
Anger by John Osborne, the domination 
of the stage by the older sirs and dames 
crumbled and the term "Angry Young 
Man• dropped down over the English 
scene like a huge canvas tarpaulin. Every-
body in the nation had to struggle · 
beneath that classification, from Osborne 
and his main character Jimmy Porter, a 
dissatisfied member of the working class 
who has risen to the rank of candy con-
cessionnaire in a Midlands cinema, to 
people like Harold Wilson and perhaps 
even extending to Hugh Lloyd-Jones, 
Regius professor of classics at Oxford. 

High on the list of the Angry went the 
name of Kenneth Haigh, the young actor 
who bad played Jimmy Porter. Haigh cer-
tainly bad the proper non-Establishment 
connections: he had come from Yorkshire, 
where his father had been a coal miner 
and his mother Irish; he attended a 
grammar school and then later came down 
to study at the Central School of Dramatic 
Art in London not from Oxford or 
Cambridge but from a few years of boxing 
in the army. 

However easily the label seemed to fit, 
it was and is unfair to Haigh. Since boy-
hood be has been faF more concerned with 
being an actor than with being angry, and 
his own career differs considerably from 
the raging inactivity of Jimmy Porter. 
He has disciplined himself so that he can 
combine great intellectuality with great 
feeling. 

Haigh is now at Yale as a member of 
the Drama School's Repertory Company, 
and he is directing John Ford's 'Tis Pity 
She's A Whore, which opens next week. 
Haigh is not quite stocky. He moves at 
a quick, disciplined pace. There is also 
a quality of toughness about him. In the 
proper circumstances, say a motion 
picture fight scene, Haigh could probably 
use his head as a lightning-quick battering 
ram, suffering but a minimum of injury 
for the effort. 

He takes being an actor very seriously. 
"In becoming an actor, I went through 
a growing confirmation in a religious 
sense," he says. "I was pledged and 
inaugurated into something until I finally 
reached a point where I couldn't chicken 
·OUt of it. 

"But I'm not an actor for fame or 
money, although I wouldn't say no to 
either. Much more to the point, I'm an 
actor because those are the gifts I have that 
enable me to learn more about life and 
about myself. 

"Every job is a further step in time and 
in my development," he adds. 

If so, then 'Tis Pity She's A Whore 
marks a major sidestep in his career, for 
this play represents his first directing 
effort. 

Haigh however prefers to emphasize the 
continuity of this venture. "Why not?" he 
asks. "Over the years I've had the pull 
and the urge, and it's time to start. A good 
actor has the director's element in him. If 
he is really humble and open, he 
contributes to his own direction, to where 
he belongs in the play. If be has the 
instinct." 

Last spring at a cocktail party, Haigh 
was talking with Robert Brustein, dean 
of the Drama School. When Brustein 
mentioned that 'Tis Pity would be staged 
in the fall, Haigh casually said he would 
enjoy directing it. 

The party broke up, Haigh went home, 
and an hour later Brustein phoned and 
asked, "Why don't you do it?" 

Haigh read and re-read the play during 
the summer while working first on a 
Kirk Douglas movie in New York City 
and then while doing a television play of 
D. H. Lawrence's "The Prussian Soldier" 
for the B.B.C. He communicated exten-
sively with the set designer but wasn't 
able to fully visualize the play until he 
returned to New Haven and began work-
ing with the actors. 

Because he believes that an audience 
should not be told in advance what to 
expect and how to react, Haigh is 
reluctant to talk about how be will stage 
Ford's play, a Jacobean tragedy of about 
1630 which deals with the incestuous love 
between a brother and a sister. 

But he will talk about what the play 
represents and why he was drawn to it. 
"The play is about things that are 
happening today, right now at this hour 
and in this country and in this city.,. 

The theme, he says, is dissent: "A man 
wills a crime against a society-if he 
cannot have his love, then to hell with 
society. This is about us, about people in 
an utterly conformist and madly John 
Birch society." 

Haigh has an affinity for characters who 
want to make their own decisions and 
thus set themselves against the established 
order. In addition to Jimmy Porter, he 
played the lead in New York in Albert 
Camus• Caligula, Jerry in the London 
production of the Zoo Story, and last 
spring the title role in Robert Lowell's 
adaption of Prometheus Bound at the 
Drama School. 

The language of 'Tis Pity She's A Whore 
also attracted Haigh: "It's the power of 
the verse, it's high poetic inspiration," be 
says. "Verse carries more meaning, it 
dramatizes philosophy; it has ambiguity." 

The source of this attraction seems to 
go to the very roots of Haigb's personality. 
Drama critic Kenneth Tynan once noted 
the "bristling, rhetorical energy" that goes 
into a Haigh performance. 

This energy characterizes the man him-
self. But off-stage it seems tenser; for 
there's a sense of compression about 
Haigh, of energy held tight within him 
only by an equally posed force of energy 
without, and it seems that at any moment 
this internal energy might burst into 
bombast or explode into a superb 
performance or suddenly let loose in a 
deadly snap. 

Haigh's ability to put his own energy 
to the service of verse became perfectly 
clear last spring during an informal 
poetry reading in the living room of 
Trumbull Master Ronald Dworkin. A 
group of students and faculty sat down in 
the room with Haigh, Robert Lowell and 
Jonathan Miller. Miller primarily pro-
vided a running commentary. Lowell, 
reaching for one book and then another, 
and Haigh did most of the poetry 
reading in response to the suggestions of 
the other people in the room. 

Haigh would read a poem, and Lowell 
would say, "Kenneth, read that line again; 
it's agony, it's marvelous," and Haigh 
would read it again, and then Lowell 
would read, mostly from other people:s 
verse. 

Then Haigh said that he'd like to read 
one of Eliot's Quartets. People were trans-
fixed by what they beard, by what Haigh 
was doing with the poetry. "He wasn't an 
actor reading the lines," said Dworkin, 
"but somebody trying as hard as he could 
to get inside the poem. Kenneth was 
tremendously affecting and moving and 
so intelligent." 

Haigh is demanding that the actors in 
'Tis Pity She's A Whore get inside their 
lines. In this sense, he's a "new critic" 
actor; that is, be rejects the Method ap-
proach in which an actor supposedly 
brings his own experience to bear. Early 
in the rehearsals for 'Tis Pity, he told the 
cast that anyone who bad committed inces~ 
with his sister and then killed her should 
step forward. No one stepped forward. 
Haigh then said that the actors would have 
to concern themselves with getting into 
the play, with translating not their own 
experience but the experience in Ford's 
lines. 

It was Haigh's energy put into Lowell's 
poetry that contributed so much to his 
performance as Prometheus. Curiously, in 
1960 Robert Brustein wrote in the New 
Republic that Haigh as Caligula had 
"achieved the solitariness necessary to the 
Promethean rebel." 

Haigh spent sixteen months playing 
Jimmy Porter in Look Back in Anger, but 
far fewer than that number of weeks as 
Prometheus; yet he regards that latter role 
as one of the great peaks of his acting 
career. 

"To tackle and unlock the mind of a 
great modern American poet coming to 
terms with a great work, a stirring and 
exciting tragedy, must be like eight years 
in the best university in the world," Haigh 
says. "It made me grow. It challenged all 
my techniques. 

"It drained me and elated me and 
brought into sharp focus through the great 
clarity of Lowell my fragmented feelings 
about the world I live in, and showed me 
how tragic it is. Prometheus is engaged in 
an unreasonable effort to free himself 
and to learn to love, against all odds and 
with no prizes. Prometheus, the thinking 
man, the freeing man, still bound." 

There is a sad side for Haigh to his 
experience as Prometheus. Because of the 
short run of the production, he knew 
from the beginning that his journey into 
the role and thus his learning about him-
self would be sharply limited: 

"It was like a still birth in that way," he 
says. "There was a post-natal depression 
that affected the entire company." 

"When it was over I just got the hell 
out of here." He stops and then says, "No; 
I went out and got drunk, I think."
