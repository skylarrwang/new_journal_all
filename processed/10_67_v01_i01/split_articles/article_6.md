Ricans moved to the cities they replaced 
the Italians. 

Because there are no more new im-
migrant groups, and because this country 
is racist, the blacks and Puerto Ricans 
have remained on the bottom, along with 
some whites who didn't make it. There 
is no replacement group in sight. 

The implication, clearly, is that those 
who are poor now will remain that way 
unless the structure of the society is 
changed in some basic way. It is foolish 
to expect that programs run by those 
who have gained power in the present 
structure will do anything but perpetuate 
that structure. 

Large corporations are making a lot of 
money these days, and there is no reason 
to expect them to disturb the status quo 
when they profit so much from it. 

If those who make decisions now con-
tinue to have that power, the poor will 
remain where they are: on the bottom. 

If the poor are going to have some voice 
in the decisions that affect their lives, 
they are going to have to take power. 

No one is going to give it to them. 

This is the fatal shortcoming of the 
Lee programs for change. They are based 
on the liberal assumption that a com-
munity of interest exists between the 
poor and the powerful. That is demon-
strably untrue, for in New Haven the lot 
of the poor has not improved despite the 
millions of dollars spent on renewal 
programs. 

The tragic fact about all this is that 
Mayor Lee does nÂ·ot understand what is 
wrong with his programs. lie is fond of 
saying in public that "if New Haven is a 
model city, then God help urban 
America"; but he is at bottom convinced 
that he bas done well. 

Talbot quotes him as replying, when 
asked if he regretted passing up the 1958 
Senatorial nomination which eventually 
went to Thomas Dodd, "Sure, every once 
in a while l have my regrets, but ... 
I've already done something that few 
men will ever do--l've rebuilt a city, not 
just any city, mind you, but a city I love." 

There is clearly something amiss in 
that city. The "riots" pointed up the prob-
lem, but Dick Lee does not understand 
what the problem is. When the Mayor 
swept into office, a bright star in a dismal 
decade for liberals, he stirred hope in the 
hearts of the poor as well as middle-class 
men of good will. The goal was, he said, 
nothing less than a "slumless city." It 
is significant that Melvin Adams, Lee's 
current Development Administrator, said 
last year that the "slumless city" wasn't, 
after all, possible; "controlled slums" is 
actually the goal. 

Why the current uneasiness? The war 
in Vietnam has cut down funds for liberal 
domestic programs, and it bas also 
alienated many blacks because they bear 
such a disproportionate burden in the 
fighting. New Raven's programs are no 
longer unique in the country, as they were 
when Lee started in the 1950's, and it is 
becoming difficult for the city to get such 
an out-of-proportion share of Federal 
money. 

Many of Lee's sharpest administrators 
have moved on, part of a new group of 
floating anti-poverty and renewal profes-
sionals who shift from city to city not 
because the work is done in one place 
but because their personal ambitions 
dictate that they keep climbing in the 
"human resources business," as Mitchell 
Sviridoff, the first executive director of 
CPI, calls it. 

Sviridoff has excelled in this game of 
personal advancement through fighting 
poverty: be left his job at CPI to head 
New York's new Human Resources 
Administration-at a substantial salary 
raise-and now, after a little over a year 
there, he is resigning to take a $50,000 
job as a Ford Foundation vice president. 

There are many other examples; New 
Haven is a training ground for renewal 
administrators all over the country. Logue 
this summer resigned as chief of the 
Boston Redevelopment Authority to run 
for mayor of that city; L. Thomas Apple-
by, who followed Logue as Development 
Administrator, now runs renewal in 
Washington, D.C.; the list is practically 
endless. 

These factors have all contributed to 
New Raven's unrest. Basically, however, 
the problem is very simple: the years of 
rhetoric by the Lee administration have 
simply never been fulfilled. CPI's training 
programs are a stopgap which help only 
a small percentage of the poor. 

Redevelopment may be rebuilding the 
city, but its major effect on all but the 
well-off is to tighten the housing market. 

The poor have not been effectively orga-
nized to make their needs felt in the city; 
they have depended on the good will of 
the Lee administration. 

They have been forced to depend on 
good will, because they have nothing to 
say about what happens. Lee's govern-
ment is a tightly-run operation, with every 
major decision cleared over his desk. 

Information about the city's plans is kept 
secret until final decisions are made. 

Consensus is the goal and too often the 
reality; plans are made not by discussion 
and disagreement but by administrative 
fiat. 

The director of a major service project 
in New Haven says that he constantly 
gets calls from the Mayor's office, saying 
"You guys take it easy over there. We're 
running this town." In that kind of 
administration the only disagreement 
tolerated is from those who already have 
significant power. The voices of the pro-
testing poor are shunted aside as quickly 
as possible. 


When the city holds Federally-required 
"public hearings" for some of its pro-
grams, Lee's officials can never understand 
why people protest. They usually return 
from these meetings shaking their heads 
and wondering "why those people don't 
understand ... why they're so unreason-
able." Then whatever plan was being 
aired goes ahead, on the assumption that 
the Mayor's people know best. 

It is ironic, in fact, that people at Yal~ 
make so much of the fact that they at 
last have a chance to participate construc-
tively in city politics. It is, after all, their 
University and their class of people for 
whom the city is being rebuilt. 

According to Allan Talbot, "New 
Raven's message to other cities is written 
in optimism ... It has demonstrated 
that the work of restoring our cities can 
be challenging, fruitful, and even fun. 
... New Haven shows that there can be 
nobility in action, that it is far better to 
participate than to watch." 

That would make ironic reading for 
the poor who are pleading with the Lee 
administration to let them run their own 
programs and rebuild their own neighbor-
hoods before it is too late. 

Dick Lee is hardly campaigning at 
all this fall, although he is running for his 
eighth term as Mayor of New Haven. 

This is, he says, a time of crisis, "no time 
for ordinary politics." He can afford not 
to campaign this year, because his Demo-
cratic Party is supported by virtually every 
group in the city with any political power. 

The Republican Party has been reduced 
to a joke. There are two new sources of 
potential opposition in the city, but 
neither bas yet organized a sufficient 
political base to be a threat at the polls. 

The first of these new additions to the 
city's political scene is the American 
Independent Movement, which ran Yale 
sociology professor Robert Cook for 
Congress last fall as an independent. 

Cook polled a little over 4000 votes within 
New Haven. AIM is basically a white 
middle-class group, drawing its bard core 
from young professionals and intellectuals 
who have banded together because of a 
common anger with the condition of the 
country. 

AIM makes no bones about its radical 
opposition to America's policies, both 
foreign and domestic. Bob Cook, writing 
about the "riots" in New Haven, bluntly 
said "that the forces which control the 
community are in fact illegitimate, that 
their law and order are in fact illegal, and 
that at bottom their position rests upon 
force and violence." 

AIM presents an often incisive intel-
lectual analysis to back up this radical 
stance; but so far it has not done any real 
organizing, and it has failed to acquaint 
the community at large with its analysis 
and its program. 

For that reason AIM is powerless, and 
poses a political threat to no one. 

The other new force in New Haven 
politics is, of course, the angry black 
people. They have not yet organized 
themselves into a force which can con-
tend for power at the polls, but they have 
certainly made themselves felt politically. 

The message they carry-the message of 
Fred Harris, the quiet little man who is 
their most impressive leader, and of the 
nameless angry men on the streetcomers 
-is that if the white people can't solve 
the problems they had better just get out 
of the way and let the black people try. 

Harris' Hill Parents Association and 
its allies are a real challenge to those in 
power, and that is why they are being 
threatened with federal prosecution. The 
militant blacks have made it too clear 
that they understand that basic changes 
are necessary. 

The Lee administration has demon-
strated that a determined liberal can do 
everything possible to rebuild urban 
America, so long as he does not chal-
lenge the right of those in power to make 
the crucial decisions on priorities. 

The real powers-the corporations-
can, Lee has demonstrated, even grow to 
appreciate a liberal program. The Mayor 
has built a political coalition that rests 
on those who have money and resources-
and this coalition therefore does not 
include the blacks and the other poor 
people in New Haven. 

The tragedy of all this is that Richard 
C. Lee does not understand why his city, 
is racked with unrest. Lee is not evil; he 
is a sincere man who wants to make 
New Haven a better place for its people. 

The Mayor has used his political genius 
to wring everything possible out of those 
who hold power; but to step outside the 
existing structure simply does not occur 
to him. 

Lee has built his political career on the 
assumption that America as he knows it 
can solve its urban problems. The nation 
as a whole has certainly not demonstrated 
that this proposition is true; and neither 
has the Lee administration. 

Friends of the Mayor say he calls 
people over to him at cocktail parties 
now, and insists on telling them about all 
these up-start critics. He has been 
fighting for a better New Haven for 14 
years, the Mayor will say-and where 
have these critics been all that time? They 
just don't understand, he says.

**The Story of M**
**Page number(s): 11**

John Sack wrote most of the story of 
M Company, a group of men gone 
off to War, sitting in the garden of a 
Saigon hotel; but strangely enough, 
it was not until four months after his 
return to the United States that he 
first began to wonder how this same 
John Sack would have felt had he 
been fighting that War.
