61 The New Journal! October 15, 1967 
The destruction of the Oak Street neighbor-
hood, New Hoven's worst slum, was the Lee 
administration's first redevelopment project. 
A typical Oak Street scene, taken in 1956, 
is below. Several hundred low-income 
families, black and whiu, were moved out,Â· 
in their place went an expressway, office 
buildings, parking lots, and the luxury apart-
ment towers shown at bollom. A two-bed-
room apartment in Madison Towers, rear, 
costs /rom $238 to $291 per month, without 
heat and hot water; three bedrooms in the 
newer Crown Towers, foreground, goes for 
$510 a month including utilities. 

Richard C. Lee was in the 1950's an 
extraordinary mayor. Liberal America bad 
to sit out the quiescent Eisenhower years, 
its radical cutting edge sapped by 
McCarthyism, its new blood shut off by 
the silent generation. Liberals roused 
themselves just often enough to cheer 
Adlai Stevenson on to defeat; the years 
between were lean. 

One of the few bright spots on the na-
tional horizon was New Haven, a middle-
sized industrial city then noted mostly as 
the site of Yale University. When Dick Lee 
became mayor in 1953, on his third try 
for the job, be did for a city of 160,000 
what Stevensonians had failed to do for the 
country: he brought liberalism to power. 

Lee has never been a Stevenson-style 
egghead. He is, on the contrary, a political 
genius who also happens to sincerely 
believe that American cities must be 
rebuilt. 

Lee came out of a working-class Irish 
neighborhood in New Haven, worked his 
way up through the local Democratic 
Party, and received his polish and fine~e 
as director of the Yale News Bureau. In his 
14 years as mayor-and he will win an 
eighth term this fall-Lee has completely 
reshaped local politics and adapted it to 
his drive to rebuild the city. 

When Lee started in 1953, Washington 
was not, as it became during the New 
Frontier, a playground for bright, sharp 
young liberals. Lee was able to bring a 
talented group of high-powered, some-
times visionary, young men to New Haven 
-the kind who worked for John 
Kennedy and now flock to the swollen 
staff of Robert Kennedy, or who find a 
spot in the liberal refuges still left in 
Johnson's Washington. 

This group--Lee gleefully called the 
building they worked in the "Kremlin"-
was beaded until 1961 by Edward Logue. 
Lee and his young hot-shots got in early 
on the Federal urban money grab-bag. 
William F. Buckley pointed out a year 
ago that if every American city got the 
amount of per-capita Federal money New 
Haven brought back from Washington, the 
national budget for urban programs alone 
would be something like $146 billion. 

New Raven's out-of-proportion suc-
cess at landing Federal money is no 
accident; by the time other cities were 
waking up to the New Frontier and the 
Great Society, Lee and his Kremlin were 
veterans at the politics and the red tape of 
extracting money from Washington. 

Lee's planners have not only bad more 
money than any other city to work with; 
they have also had greater political free-
dom. By using redevelopment and later 
the war on poverty as his tools, Lee has 
completely reshaped the power bases 
of the New Haven Democratic Party. 

When Lee assumed office in 1953, 
power within the party was split between 
John Golden, the aging Irish boss who is 
now Democratic National Committeeman 
from Connecticut, and Arthur Barbieri, 
the new Town Chairman who brought 
dissident Italians into the Democratic 
fold. 

Lee has let those men keep the tradi-
tional party organization and traditional 
patronage sources like the Public Works 
Department. 

His stategy has been to bring new 
muscle into the Party-muscle which 
ultimately is much more important than 
the old-line ward organization which 
Barbieri still runs. 

Unlike old-style reformers, Lee made 
no attempt to capture the traditional city 
structure; he doesn't even control the 
Board of Aldermen, although all of its 33 
members are Democrats. 

Lee has his people in these institutions, 
but the basic strategy of control is much 
simpler; be just created another city 
government parallel to and eventually 
above the old one. It's not in the City 
Charter, but Lee's private government is 
what is shaping the city. 

This new government is the Redevelop-
ment Agency and the complex of organi-
zations around it, plus since 1962 Com-
munity Progress, Inc., the local anti-
poverty program. At the head is the 
Development Administrator, who in fact 
is the deputy mayor. 

Logue occupied this post until 1961; 
L. Thomas Appleby, who had the job for 
four years, and Melvin J. Adams, who has 
it now, both started under Logue in the 
Kremlin. The actual boss of this whole 
complex is, of course, the Mayor. 

This highly paid, well-staffed, sophisti-
cated bureaucracy has assumed control of 
New Haven. It makes all important de-
cisions about the shape of the city: which 
stores occupy the downtown, which in-
dustries get new plants, what highways go 
where and who gets new houses. It has 
a monopoly of information and expertise, 
so that whoever challenges it can neither 
disprove what it says nor criticize its 
future plans. 

Traditional government agencies cannot 
compete: many of the non-salaried alder-
men, who lack even secretarial help, did 
not even read the 1967 city budget before 
they passed it. While the city bas done well 
in school construction, which falls under 
the Redevelopment Agency, the educa-
tional program itself-which is under the 
Board of Education-has made little 
significant progress. 

Allan Talbot, in his book The Mayor's 
Game (published early this year), provides 
an excellent account of Lee's techniques 
in transferring power from the traditional 
city government to his private bureau-
cracy. 

What is important, however, is not 
the politics by which this was done-
although it was a brilliant piece of work-
but the implications of this power 
transfer. 

Lee's private government has provided 
him with a vast patronage pool, financed 
not by local taxes but by Federal and 
foundation money. The Board of Alder-
men bas been rendered impotent so that 
the people cannot make their views felt 
at the polls short of throwing out their 
apparently impregnable Mayor. 

Lee has tied his nationally-known 
liberal image to his renewal programs; and 
the agencies that run those programs act 
as one of the biggest and most efficient 
public relations organizations any 
politician ever had. 

The most important fact about this new 
power, however, is that it has integrated 
the city government with the real powers 
in New Haven life: the banks, big business, 
and Yale. It is these groups who give 
Mayor Lee decisive backing both in the 
city and within the Democratic Party. 

Corporate power has traditionally left 
municipal politics to its own devices, be-
cause local government has rarely iilter-
fered with business. With the advent of an 
administration that proposed to rebuild 
New Haven, that relationship had to 
change. 

Yale was the first corporate power in the 
city to recognize the potential of the Lee 
program. The Mayor had become friends 
with top Yale people during his 10-year 
tenure at the University's News Bureau. 
A. Whitney Griswold, the late President 
of Yale, was vital in rallying University 
support for Lee, from the Corporation on 
down. One of Lee's unparalleled feats at 
the News Bureau was getting Griswold on
