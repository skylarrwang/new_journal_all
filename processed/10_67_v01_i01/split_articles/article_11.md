"What did you do this weekend, 
Edelstein?" 
"I went to New York." 
"What did you do in New York, 
"Went to see films." 
"How many films did you see, 
"Five . .. " 
"Jesus Christ, five films in one week-
end!" 
" ... on Saturday and four on Sunday." 

Teacher after teacher these past four years 
has concluded the calling of the roll in the 
first class of the year by asking, "And does 
anybody know Mr. Edelstein?" 

It seems that Mr. Edelstein is never 
there. 

As regular as the seasons themselves, 
Robert Edelstein has come up to Yale each 
year to register but then, except for a few 
scattered classes here and there caught 
between trains, has disappeared for two 
weeks. 

The reason for this disappearance is 
that the first two weeks of the academic 
term at Yale conflict with the New York 
Film Festival, and the Festival is some-
thing that Edelstein would not want to 
miss. 

You ask Edelstein if it's absolutely 
necessary that he take in the Festival; and 
he shrugs his shoulders, and his face 
somehow seems to shrug itself and he emits 
an indefinite sound and then he smiles; 
and after that you know it's absolutely 
necessary. 

Although the Registrar may regard him 
as nothing more than Robert K. Edelstein, 
Yale College, 1968, with "Chrm. of Yale 
Film Society" on his activity sheet; he is 
in fact Edelstein the Film-maker, who has 
devoted much of his Yale career to making 
Sally's Hounds, soon to be shown by.that 
same film society. 

Edelstein has about him the look of 
those young men who grew up a genera-
tion-and-a-half ago in New York City, 
loving the movies, and who quit high 
school to go to work as runners in some 
studio's New York office and then set out 
to Hollywood for careers as brilliant 
directors. 

But that's not the way things are today. 
("Go to college and get that piece of 
paper, boy.") You can still pull it off, but 
only if you have a relative already in the 
business; and Edelstein's connections are 
only tangential-his parents are Jules and 
Tita The Vaudeville Magicians. (He did 
the magic, she had the legs). So Edelstein 
the Film-maker came to Yale. 

He wasn't however always Edelstein the 
Film-maker. First, he was Edelstein the 
Big Reader. "I did tons of reading when 
I was three," he says, "but I stopped read-
ing at five. Words were too hard." 

Then he became Edelstein the writer, a 
condition that persisted for many years, 
including most of high school, although 
he can't quite remember what he wrote. 

"I think I was unconscious for most of 
high school,'' he explains. "It's a complete 
blank. I don't know what I did." 

One thing he did was to go to the 
movies almost every day, but that was 
just as a typical movie fan. Towards the 
end of high school, though, he went to 
see Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, and 
Edelstein the Film-maker was born. 

He's seen the movie seven times since, 
but he's never forgotten how the film so 
stunned him the first time. "I was amazed,'' 
he says. "It wasn't just a horror film. 
Hitchcock was saying something pro-
found, though he refuses to give the 
impression of being a serious artist when 
he speaks." 

You try to tell Edelstein that you saw 
this same Hitchcock's North by Northwest 
a few nights ago, that the story was 
ridiculous, that the acting was minimal, 
that the sets looked like sets, and that all 
you could think of in the climactic scene 
where Cary Grant grips Eva Marie Saint's 
hand as she slides down the face of 
Mt. Rushmore was the toy George 
Washington savings bank you got for 
opening your first bank account. 

Edelstein shrugs his shoulders at this, 
and his face seems to shrug itself somehow, 
and he emits the indefinite sound, smiles 
and then finally disagrees. He explains 
that Hitchcock is
