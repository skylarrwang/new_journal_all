The Story of M 
By Gerald Bruck 
M, by John Sack. New American Library. 
In a Southern airport several weeks ago, 
I ran into a GI named Jim, who eyed the 
typewriter I was carrying and asked with 
some bitterness if I was on my way back 
to college. As for Jim, he was on his way 
to Vietnam, he held the orders in an 
envelope he carried under one arm, be 
had twenty-one days with the home folks 
before be bad to go. Surprised and a little 
embarrassed to have run into the Ameri-
can Commitment, I asked if he saw any 
reason for the war. 

No, he said, he didn't. 

"Really?" I asked, adding that he must 
have some reason for risking his life and 
shooting at people. 

"I can't think of any," he murmured, 
omitting even the easy ones he must have 
heard a thousand times. 

Well, as he saw it, Jim said, he didn't 
have any choice. 

"You could not go," I said, and listed 
every way of not going I could think of, 
but Jim said no, be didn't have a choice. 

Not that anyone had asked him or his 
parents, and someone or something was 
extracting the highest price Jim could 
pay, but, well, yeah. 

He didn't want to go that much, either, 
he said. He bad learned all about these 
punji pits, jungle trick pits filled with 
poisoned, pointed steel-hard bamboo 
sticks that wrecked you, feet first. First 
the army made steel-soled shoes, but the 
enemy redesigned the pits so that the 
sticks came at the victim's feet from the 
sides as well as the bottom, and the army 
had phased out steel-soles. 

Jim knew about a million other mur-
derous things that lurked, ready for him, 
in the jungle, and they played on his mind. 

"Of course, the pay's not bad," he said 
all of a sudden, and if I fall into a punji 
pit and get out I get a purple heart." 

But be couldn't convince himself, and 
suddenly he turned to me and said he 
figured he'd make it though, in Vietnam, 
the real source of sorrow was trooping 
around the jungle "for a whole year in 
those baggy clothes", away from his 
mother, his father, brothers and sisters, 
and his girl, in that order. 

"Maybe you'll get wounded," I said 
as our jet sucked through the dark skies 
over South Carolina, "or your friends will 
be killed, and you'll turn into a right-
winger and go after people back here who 
didn't 'support' you all." 

"Yeah, maybe," he said, staring dully 
at a copy of Time magazine, and then he 
asked me if I knew how Scotch tasted, 
and ordered drinks with his friends. 

About two years ago a very humorous 
man named John Sack, who thrives on 
Contracliction, on sins against reason, 
was struck with the talk about our boys 
and decided be had hit on a big one. 

Harvard '51, he had started writing his 
first book-it concerned a Harvard team 
which had conquered a big South 
American mountain and lost some toes on 
the way down-while still on the Radclifie 
desk of the Crimson. He volunteered for 
the Korean war on the verge of induction, 
wrote for Stars and Stripes during his tour 
of duty, and later wrote a book about 
army life, making fun of it. 

Sack settled down to writing pieces for 
the New Yorker, but he couldn't get at 
the big Contradiction writing for them-
they harnessed his satire against trivial 
demons--and he became a producer for 
CBS in 1961. 

So this army contradiction came along, 
and he wrote a letter to Esquire. He had 
been reading about brave boys jumping 
out of helicopters, Sack reported, and he 
"just didn't dig it." The army was the 
army, lots of people knew what that was 
like. Maybe this war didn't lend itself to 
humor, maybe people were afraid of black 
humor, but Sack would try. He would 
quit CBS. He underestimated the expense 
that his approach-following a company 
of soldiers through basic training and 
their first battle in Vietnam-would 
entail, and Esquire thought about it quick 
and said yes. 

So Sack went off to mix with the men 
at Fort Dix, New Jersey, wrote part of it 
up for Esquire, and built a brilliant book 
out of it all, which was published last 
February, received rave reviews from all 
over, and sold "quietly," as the lingo goes. 

There is one copy at the Co-op. 

The most exciting trend in writing now-
adays is creative journalism, with its 
exhaustive examinations, its worship of 
the detail. The best of the "saturation 
journalists" make no claims to "objec-
tivity," however. They pick their details, 
and weave them into a quick, tight fabric, 
inserting an analytical line now and then. 

John Sack added a new dimension to 
the genre. Before M, the details consisted 
in the appearance of a person, a thing, 
an event; in the bottomless pit of past 
history, or background; in the visible 
actions, picked into pieces, described 
with microscopic intensity; and in the 
wild descent into hyperbole. Sack tells you 
what his subjects are thinking, and it 
transforms the work. M often reads like a 
novel: how can a reporter find out all 
these things? 

"It's simple," Sack announced trium-
phantly to Tom Wolfe, who came seeking 
the secret so that he could explain it to 
his college audiences. "It's so simple I 
can't get over it. You ask them. Then you 
have to judge whether they're telling the 
truth, if they're embellishing it, and how. 
Sometimes, the little things people say 
give away what they've been thinking for 
the last few minutes." 

People like Sack can ask their subjects, 
hey, what were you thinking?-and get 
away with it, because they stick around 
for a spell, and because they approach 
their subjects with humility. 

Over the summer, Sack shared a house 
on Long Island with David Halberstam, 
who covered South Vietnam for the New 
York Times during 1962 and '63, an 
adept just-the-facts-ma'am reporter, and 
once Sack mentioned he would like to 
write about the hippies, and wondered 
out loud what the best approach to his 
research would be. 

"You have to go in hard," replied the 
ex-Times man, ''you have to ask them hard 
questions and don't take any bullshit." 

"No man, no man," said Sack, "that's 
no way to get information here, you have 
to go in naked, I have to know if their 
way of living is better than mine, whether 
they have something to teach me." 

So Sack went into Fort Dix somewhat 
naked-not that he expected the army to 
remake him-and be found out about 
the guys, wrote down what they did and 
asked them what they were thinking. 

When he finally wrote it up, he drew on 
the two years of physics he had taken at 
Harvard, the result of an early interest 
in shooting things into outer space, and he 
put together a for-the-most-part 
exquisitely-crafted collage of people and 
time spans, laced with literary allusions, 
hyperbole, and stop-'em-cold phrases. 

The result is prose to surf on, an 
exhilarating journey into the absurd with 
real people doing this and that and crafty 
1 ohn Sack at the helm. 

Possibly the overwhelming ab-
surdity of rounding up an average bunch 
of guys and sending them to Vietnam-
but especially this bunch of guys, most of 
them inducted into the army-moved 
Sack to write after eight pages that "All 
this happened--do understand. Demirgian 
is real, so is everyone in this account, 
even the Chillicothe milkman ... " 

There was Smith, the religious soldier, 
who had seen a vision of himself as a 
missionary to all mankind when one wall 
of his father's barn had turned into a 
giant television screen, and who had 
joined the army as a test of God's wish 
that Smith refrain from killing. 

One morning in autumn, Smith had 
attached a thin piece of steel to his army 
rifle to be taught bayonet by a 
sergeant who knew the secret of man 
against man ... "So when I say what is 
the purpose of the bayonet," the 
Sergeant had explained loudly, "I want 
you all to yell, to kill! So what is the 
the purpose of the bayonet?" 

"To kill," Smith's acquaintances 
answered in deep embarrassment, the 
rifles in their hands like the reins of a 
runaway horse. 

When the rest of M caught on ("To kill 
-to kill-to kill"), Smith still could not, 
and finally he was praying beside his army 
cot: "And Father, I didn't have the spirit 
with the bayonet today. Father, may it be 
thy will to help me with the bayonet." 

Soon, with an interpretation of the com-
mandments by the army chaplain, Smith 
had come around. 

There was Prochaska, the soldier from 
Iowa who liked everything and everybody 
in his country, and joined the army "as 
other men might tithe to their church." 

One night, Prochaska was sitting out a 
weekend leave at a restaurant near the 
post, listening to "What We're Fighting 
For," his favorite song, on the juke box: 
Tell them that we're fighting for the 
old Red, White and Blue! 

Did they forget Pearl Harbor and 
Korea too? 

A not her flag must never fly above 
our nation's door ... 

Exactly, ... exactly, Prochaska thought. 

That is why he had enlisted-it would 
be Vietnam first, Thailand after that, 
Hawaii next, California-Iowa. He 
wanted his children to share his bless-
ings, to sing and go fishing in Minne-
sota and to have hamburgers and Coke. 

There was Williams, a black soldier 
from Florida "whose imagination was 
always getting jerked out of its innocence 
whenever the army spelled out to its 
soldiers what is expected of them;" 

McCarthy, who married Marilyn before 
he left for Vietnam, only to have her 
divorce him when he got there; and 

Varoujan Demirgian, whose last name was 
Armenian for Smith, who tried to have 
his jaw broken to escape the army, and 
of whom more later. 

The Chillicothe milkman was Elmer 
Pulver, who had abandoned his milk route 
for the Korean War, and who, one 
Saturday morning in 1966, had taken his 
son, Douglas, along to the office, and 
picked who of M would represent 
America in Vietnam, for Pulver was now 
a major with a secretary and a windowless 
office in one of the Pentagon's inner rings. 

Pulver went through M's IBM cards indi-
cating each soldier's preference, but there 
weren't any vacancies in Hawaii, Japan, 
or Canada that week and while he ex-
plained to his blond eight-year-old that 
Daddy's job was to send the men where 
they wanted to go, soldier after soldier 
ended up with an assignment to Vietnam. 

("Daddy, I can do it myself-please," 
Douglas said, but Daddy chuckled and 
said no .. .'') 

And in time M is bundled off to Viet-
