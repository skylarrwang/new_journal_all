Buildings
Everybody who is somebody has one.
Selected law students, a few under-
graduates, English teachers, art students.
Even Reuben Holden, secretary of Yale,
has a relic of the University's most recent
victims of modernization-those much-
celebrated and late-lamented red brick
Victorian "monsters," Winchester and
North Sheffield Halls.

"They are splendid monoliths of the
past," acknowledged Kingman Brewster
Jr. in 1965, as he prepared to sic the iron
ball on the two structures, making way for
the first building commissioned under
his presidency-an Engineering and
Applied Science edifice which Vincent
Scully promptly called "one prolonged
stutter, a folded-paper fayade too high, too
long, too meaninglessly articulated, too
thin, too superficial, too pretentious ....
It should live alone with the Beinecke
Library in goo-goo land."

Now those be-gargoyled and orna-
mented, but solid-looking buildings on
Prospect just north of Grove have been
demolished. "I used to go by them every
day on my way to work;' said one teacher.
"Suddenly I went by and they were gone.
I didn't realize how much I'd miss them."

North Sheffield Hall, 1872-1967, and
Winchester Hall, 1892-1967, have gone
the way of Osborn Hall, Marquand
Chapel and Kent Chemical Laboratory.
Winchester contained some research labs
and classrooms for general use. North
Sheff, which had been criticized for in-
sufficient space since 1875, about the same.
They were doomed for their terrible
inefficiency (huge stair-wells and poor
distribution of offices), so much so that
even some who liked the buildings felt
they had to go.

The band of valiant men who tried to
save them were fated to fail from the
beginning. Professional cynics scoffed at
the notion of structures "conversing" and
"participating in a great conversation of
the generations," but for the happy few
who believe that buildings are fabulous
manifestations of man's humanity,
Winchester and North Sheff were
splendid indeed.

They were made of warm red brick:,
their fayades severe but generous, grand
in scale yet not too massive for the street
they faced. They were studded with fluted
ornaments, gargoyles, moulded brick, in-
tricate balustrades, mosaic masterpieces,
granite columns. Designed by J. Cleveland
Cady, who also produced the old Met,
they were rare buildings from a specific
past which offered that past to the com-
munity. "The city needs the past," Mr.
Scully has written. "That's its dimension
and, in fact, its meaning."

There were lots of people at Yale who
recognized Mr. Scully's tenet. "The
University," said Reuben Holden, "didn't
want to lose some of those great pieces,"
so it acquired from the fey structures
5 columns, an old door and an iron gate,
now stored at the Yale Nursery in
Hamden. Mr. Holden said Yale hasn't
decided precisely what to do with them.

Meantime, hordes of students and
faculty descended on Winchester and
Nonh Sheff dail)'. or rather nightly when
Stamford House Wrecking completed its
daily task, to retrieve the ornaments just
lying around.

Mr. Holden personally salvaged a
magnificent metal grill for his office. A
Jaw student brought his VW to the site
one quiet evening and hauled off four
sculpted pieces of dusty brick. Others

scavenged periodically to get the choicest
relics.

Most energetic of all was William K.
Wimsatt, professor of English. Mr. Wim-
satt appeared at dusk every evening for
two straight weeks in search of marble and
terra cotta icons. He collected thousands
of small, handcut multicolored tesserae
from Winchester's portico ceiling, along
with apple-sized terra cotta capitals which
bad come crashing down from between
the second and third story windows. The
capitals had been quickly covered with
rubble, and he was able to salvage only 7
out of a possible 176 capitals. He also
retrieved large bricks with classical egg
and dart edges. They will make "beautiful
book ends," said Mr Wimsatt.

"I wanted to take away one of those
huge pieces myself," said another teacher.
"But I thought it was illegal. And since
the only place I could put the things
would be my front yard, I didn't want an
open invitation to the local police of that
order. I've got enough problems."

Unaware of this controversy, workers
from the different contracting firms
continued and continue to work. Tbe
Stamford wreckers, who finished their job
October 2, took seven weeks to bring the
old ladies down. As legal owners of the
rubble, they sold the used bricks by the
thousands for such uses as antique fire-
places. An ignominious end for such
heroic buildings, perhaps, but not so bad
when you consider that their spirit will
thus live somewhere for a long time to
come.

Ralph Kaufman, foreman of the
Stamford wreckers, had never heard
about the dispute at Yale, though he had
consented to let people walk off with
some of the bricks. "I don't like these
kind of buildings anyway," he said.

Bob Schovanec, foreman for the firm
which will construct Marcel Breuer's
E & AS building for the next two years,
declined to comment. "Sure I was aware
they were supposed to be beautiful
buildings. But I'm staying neutral,:' he
said. "We have a job to do, and we do it."

Mr. Schovanec, who oversaw construction
of the Kline Science Center, said work:
was going well over there on Prospect
Street. He thought taking remains from
the site was against the Jaw, but agreed
that the old bricks were indeed "worth
more."

"You can't duplicate age," he said.
"That's the problem. You just can't. I
guess that's why people didn't want to
tear these buildings down."

U Winchester and North Sheff bad been
given 20 more years, Vincent Scully once
suggested, then Yale wouldn't have
dared to demolish them. But the big iron
ball on the 120-foot boom on the 70-ton
P & H wrecker finished it for all time,
unless those who saved all the pieces
want to get together some day to re-
assemble, from the fireplaces, hontyards
and libraries of New England, the skeletal
ghosts of Winchester and North Sheffield
Halls.

**Title: Truth**
**Page number(s): 2, 19**

There were two worlds at the New York
Film Festival. The Mods lined up outside
to see the glossy Scandinavian and Eastern
European sex farces, most of which were
filmed in naturalistic detail reminiscent of
Beaver Valley.

Meanwhile, in the back rooms, the
dedicated cineasts gathered to follow
a 14-film series entitled "The Social
Cinema in America." In such panels
as "Reality Cinema: Whose Truths?" and
"The Ethics of Documentary" they
tortuously debated questions on how to
depict reality. The best answers to those
questions-although not all would
acknowledge it-were implicit in the
superb film Far From Vietnam. But that
came at the conclusion of the Festival,
and first there were those debates.

Many of the American documentary
makers apparently feel that they can
attain their ideal of 'objectivity.' Cinema
verite is their slogan: the photographic
image is a record of reality in progress,
undisturbed by any point-of-view behind
the camera. For them, the aesthetic goal of
'objectivity' corresponds exactly to the
ethical goal of 'truth.'

Donn Pennebaker, the maker of Don't
Look Back, a film on Bob Dylan, stood up
for 'objectivity.' Speaking at the "Reality
Cinema" discussion, he said that he had
refused to make Dylan walk through a
door twice to get a shot he had missed the
first time around. U the camera jiggles
because the cameraman laughed at a
joke, keep it in, Pennebaker advised, show
the jiggle to the audience. Anything else
would be 'dishonest.' A few network
people who admitted that they had redone
an occasional reaction shot were
ferociously berated.

The participants in the "Ethics" dis-
cussion a few days later were a little more
relaxed about their metaphysics. Occa-
sionally a panel member screwed up his
courage and admitted that every film
embodied a point-of-view. 'Dishonest' was
again thrown around a few times, but it
seemed to be a word used primarily to
describe the work of others.

One panelist cited a film about the
birth control controversy in Puerto Rico.
He thought the film was dishonest be-
cause the director had shot the pro-birth
control spokesman from below, in a
garden filled with sun-dappled trees and a
gently rustling soundtrack, but had used a
gravelly-voiced bishop as the anti-birth
control spokesman and bad forced this
bishop to squint into the sunlight while
being photographed hom above.

When pressed, this critical panelist
finally admitted that he really thought the
image was too gross and he himself would
have done it more subtly.

At this point, I began to think: that
the ethics of the documentary would be
Jess of a problem if the aesthetics were
more clearly understood.

It is tempting but insufficient to douse
this smoldering philosophizing with a
statement that all art is subjective. The
problem is particularly pressing in film-
making because it is the artistic medium
that at once conveys the sense of truth
most strongly and at the same time the one
in which that truth can most easily and
subtly be manipulated.

Some panelists felt that the entire prob-
lem could be solved by simply giving all
people education in the techniques of
film-making, perhaps along the Jines of
How to Lie With Statistics; but this does
not seem to be the solution.

Panelists in both discussions seemed
to assume that point-of-view automatically
