unadvisable at this time, and they had 
received instructio.ns to proceed to 
Toronto. Passenger information in 


Chicago had been informed, as would be 
all major cities which might have been 
ultimate destinations. As soon as O'Hare 
cleared they would be returning to 
Chicago, but American would make every 
effort to assist those passengers who 
wished to make other travel arrangements 
in Toronto. If things went well they 
expected to arrive by 2 P.M., eastern time. 
The boy across from Torch pressed his 
forehead against the window, and cupped 
his hands on either side of his cheeks. 
"There is a note," the priest said. 
"There is a helluva note, eh . . . My son, 
I'm afraid I've forgotten your name." 
"Torch." He rose, looking around the 
cabin. 

"Sit still. Sit still. Nobody has to stand 
... Torch, eh? The lightbearer. Oh, for 
your hair. Your hair's red eh? I can still 
see colors. I can still ... Say, sit down. 
You don't have to stand for me." 
"No, I'm looking ... " Torch hesitated, 
then exhaled heavily and seated himself. 

"Well, at least we'll have a little 
excitement, eh Torch? A little ... A 
reprieve. A stay of execution." 
Torch nodded absently. 

"Or maybe ... immediate. We may have 
... Say, my name, I don't believe I've 
introduced myself, my name ... " 

"Father Tyres." 

"No. No, my name is Pete. Peter. You 
may call me Pete. That's my name again. 
Pete or Peter, whichever ... The rock, 
upon which ... My son, the Church is in 
steady hands. Steady and capable ... All 
you, uh, of what I may call the Catholic 
persuasion Torch? Are you persuaded in 
that particular direction?" 

"Say, Father, if you don't mind ... " 

"Well, be comforted. If you should ever 
wish ... It is in steady and capable hands." 
He looked at his hands, raising them 
chest-high. "Although at the given moment 
my hands ... tremble a trifle, as a general 
rule the Church ... You may kiss my 
ring." 
Torch turned and looked at him. 

"For God's sake." 

"Not exactly, eh Torch? Not ... That's 
strange. I had it here a moment ago." 
The priest inserted his right hand in the 
sickness bag. "Oh dear. My white plume. 
And with the Council reconvening in a 
few short days. Well, you may kiss my 
hand now, ringare, as the saying goes. The 
ring is a mere ... symbol. The spirit's 
essence resides within." 

"Look Father, I ... " 

"No, no, I insist. It's the spirit of the 
thing. Unto all men let the Living Word 
come. I insist." 
Torch took the priest's hand and passed 
his mouth an inch above it. "E Pluribus 
Unum." 

"Did you ... I didn't feel ... Oh, right. 
Right Torch. E pluribus ... Non 
cognoscenti alabaster, eh Torch? 
Dominoes non est backgammon. Uh, 
glaucoma, glaucoma, glaucoma." The 
priest swallowed with difficulty, attempting 
to clear his ears as the plane passed 
through a succession of air pockets. 

"Father, I'm afraid you'll have to 
excuse me." Torch looked over at the boy, 
whose shoulders could be seen heaving 
rhythmically. "I want to try to find ... " 
The priest had not followed Torch's 
glance. He took his arm again as Torch 
tried to rise. "Say, don't go. Don•t ... 
You know, I was supposed to console you. 
The stewardess ... " 

"Have you seen the stewardess?" 

"It is hardly likely that I ... would see 
... It is ... Say, the stewardess made a 
special point of sitting you next to me. 
For purposes of consolation. That I might 
reveal ... God's word. God's ... She said 
your younger brother had died?" 
Torch again seated himself, now 
removing the priest's arm more forcefully. 

"Don't talk about that Father. That's none 
of your business." 

"On the contrary. That is the essence 
. . . Would you care to hear some 
appropriate scriptural passages? I stole a 
Gideon from my hotel in Los Angeles." 
Torch stared at the priest, his face 
growing red. "You'd better shut up 
Father. I mean it." 
The priest looked down, and began to 
strike his knee again. ''The essence ... of 
my business. The ... I'm sorry. I'm .. . 
But you see, if he happened to die of a 
lingering illness ... No, she said it was 
an accident. But if it had happened to be 
a ... I could quote a number of appro-
priate ... The people of Dumaran bad a 
peculiar susceptibility to certain drawn-
out, terminal diseases. Terminal is ... " 
The plane banked sharply, and the boy 
let out a long shrill scream. Torch rose. 

" ... a medical term. I read many books, 
so that I could send for the proper ... " 

"And you don't even hear a kid crying. 
A hero like yourself." Torch stared at the 
priest for a moment, then turned away, 
moving across the aisle to seat himself 
next to the boy. He placed his hand on the 
boy's arm. "Hey ace, turn around." The 
boy moved his arm away from Torch's 
hand. Torch took a slow breath. "Hey, 
don't cry ace, will you please? There's 
nothin' to cry about." 

There was a short silence. Finally the 
boy turned to Torch, the lower part of his 
face tucked beneath his shoulder. Tears 
showed on his cheeks, but he'd stopped 
crying. "Where's Toronto?" 

"Never mind about Toronto. Toronto's 
not far." 

"No, but how far?" 

"A little ways. A couple of hours." 
Torch looked at the boy. "Hey, what 
about your hands?" 
The boy looked down at his hands. 

"Why don't you go wash up? Why don't 
you go wash your hands up?" 
The boy turned back to the window. 

"Can you do'em by yourself?" 
He nodded. 

"Hey, well I'm gonna go back to the 
lounge. Right next to the boys· room. You 
go wash up, and then if you want you 
come back there and sit with me. Okay?" 
Torch got up. "I'm gonna go back there. 
Okay ace? I'm gonna go back there now." 
He walked into the lounge and sat 
down. When the stewardess left the pilot's 
cabin he asked for a Budweiser, and she 
got the beer from the inset refrigerator 
behind the bar, remarking to Torch a$ 
she did so that she'd never seen so much 
drinking in her life on a morning fiight, 
people usually slept on this one. 
The boy did not move from his seat for a 
short while. But finally, after quickly 
looking around the cabin, then momen-
tarily lowering his head again, he rose and 
walked to the washroom, which was 
situated between the first-class section and 
the lounge. The priest, who had been 
staring dully at the no-smoking sign, 
periodically tapping his knee with his 
right hand, watched him go in silence. 
After some time the boy came out of the 
washroom and wordlessly seated himself 
in the chair beside Torch's. 

"You want some beer ace?'' Torch 
leafed through a magazine be had picked 
up as the boy entered. 
The boy looked at Torch, then picked 
up the beer and took a small sip, 
grimacing. 

"I get your brand?" 
The boy shook his bead yes. 

"Yes or no." 

"Yes." 

"What kind is it?" 
The boy thought a moment. "Hamm's." 

"Right." Torch put the magazine away. 
The boy looked out the window. 

"Hamm's is the one my ... daddy drinks." 

"Oh yeah?" 

"Uh hub." There was a short silence . 

"My daddy was supposed to meet me in 
Chicago." 

"And bow about your mom?" 
The boy shook his head no. 
Torch shifted in his seat. "Well look, 
uh ... Hey, you know where ... Toronto's 
in Canada. D'you know where Canada 
is?" 

"Sure." 

"Ub-hub." Torch ran his hand through 
his hair. "Well that's where Toronto is." 

"Far?" 

"Not far. A couple of hours." Torch 
looked at the boy. "How's the beer?" 

"Okay." 

"Why don't you let me get you a coke 
or something." 

"No, this is okay." 

"Okay. Hey, what were you doing in 
California?" 
The boy shrugged. 

"You were on a vacation eb?" 
He nodded. "With my aunts." 

"How long were you out there?" 

"A long time." 

"What, like about a month?" 

"Yep." 
Torch took a long sip of his beer. "Hey, 
well d 'you see anything? See Disneyland?" 

"Uh-huh." The boy yawned. 
Torch looked at him carefuJiy. "How 
was that?" 


"D'you go on the Matterhorn? Here, 
c'mere." Torch drew the boy toward his 
shoulder. "D'you go on the Matterhorn?" 
The boy nodded his head, yawning. 

"I got sick on the Matterhorn," Torch 
said. "I'm afraid of heights. How about 
yourself? D'you get sick?" 

"Nope." The boy look'ed up. "I went 
twice. I went twice on the Matterhorn,'· 
he yawned, "and three times on the flying 
saucer~.'' 

"What else?" 

"I don't know." He nestled his head on 
Torch's shoulder, looking up at the 
ceiling. "Once on the Magic Carpet.'' 

"Adventureland?" 
The boy nodded sleepily. 

''Tomorrowland?" 

"Nope. It was too late.'' 

"How'd you go on the flying saucers?" 

"Oh yeah. We went there. We couldn't 
go to Frontierland though. It was too 
late.'' 

"You liked it huh?" 
The boy shook his head yes. 

"Yes?" 

"Uh-buh." He yawned again. 

"Hey ace, why don't you get some 
sack?" 
The boy raised his head quickly. 

"No, I'm gonna be right here. C'mon, 
put it down. I'm gonna stay right here.'' 
The boy wriggled in the seat, getting 
comfortable, and Torch began to hum. 

"Yum da da de dum, my pretty one, pretty 
one, yum de da day de, my baby, my 
ownnn .. .'' He let his voice go off-key on 
the last note, and extended it into a soft 
howl. The boy looked up, smiling, and 
Torch pushed his hair into his eyes. 

"Smart kid. C'mon, put it down.'' Torch 
slid down in the seat, keeping his shoulder 
raised for the boy's head. He stared at the 
wall above the window before him. 
The boy rested his head again. "Will 
my daddy be in Toronto?" 

"You'll see him in a couple of hours. 
•
C'mon, keep quiet, I'm trying to get som1 sc
sleep here." 

a
"Okay. G'night." 

b
"G'night ace." 

P
Torch remained in the lounge for 
n
something more than half an hour befonh
he quietly rose and walked toward the 
s
stewardess' quarters in the rear of the 
plane. He passed the priest without 
speaking. 

r 
The stewardess was disposing of the 
remnants of the passengers' breakfasts in a 
large foil container. She smiled wearily 
c
as he feigned a knock on the folded 
1
curtain. 

"Say, I wonder if you can tell me what I
arrangements are being made for when we 5
get to Toronto?" 

'
"Well, it depends on whether you want 
to remain with the plane sir. If you don't, l
there'll be customs to go through, so we 
would advise .. .'' 

''No, I can rent a car or something, 
actually Toronto's better for me, but this .
kid, the one who's sitting next to me? He's 
supposed to meet his dad in Chicago. 
What arrangements are being made?" 

"Well, he'll be flown back to Chicago as 1
soon as possible." 

"Yeah, but what about in Toronto. 
Will there be someone to stay with him?" 

"Well ... " 

"What are you gonna be doing?" 

"We have to stay on the plane.'' 

"Could he stay with you? Someone 
ought to be with him." 

"You can't stay?" 

"I've ... No, I'd like to, but I've got to 
get home.'' 
She hesitated a moment, then smiled. 

"Yes. All right.'' 

"Thanks." Torch smiled too, and 
started to leave, then turned back. "Hey 
was that your idea to sit me next to that 
priest?" 
The stewardess blushed. "No, that's 
. . . If we know about the death we're 
supposed to do that. If there's a clergyman 
on board. That's American policy." 
Torch half-smiled. "Okay. Hey, thanks 
about the other thing." 

"We're always glad ... That's all right." 
Torch walked back through the cabin 
and into the lounge, where the boy had 
continued to sleep. He stared for a moment 
at the beer on the table before him, then 
picked it up and sipped it indifferently, 
afterwards seating himself beside the boy, 
and draping his arm around him, and 
closing his eyes. 
A few moments later he looked into the 
passenger's cabin, and saw the priest 
standing in the aisle, talking to the 
stewardess, his hands on the seats to 
either side of him. When he had finished 
speaking with her he began to walk toward 
the lounge. Torch was staring at the wall 
when he arrived. 
The priest seated himself across from 
him, and peered over at the boy. ''That 
was, uh, very kind. That ... I didn't 
realize ... "The priest lowered his voice 
almost to a whisper, and spoke in slow, 
halting phrases. "I didn't realize he was 
upset. I didn't notice him.'' 
Torch stared out the window. "You let 
the kid sleep now Father. You'd better not 
wake him up.'' 

"I ... No, I shan't. I'll keep my voice 
... " Father Tyres looked up at Torch. 
I'm ... very sorry. I'm ... Please accept 
... I apologize. Since my return it seems 
my life consists of offences and apologies. 
my apologies.'' 

"Well, I can see, you know, what with 
your being in the middle of your act, you 
know, how you wouldn't hear him." 
The priest lowered his head. "I've 
become ... inured, to that particular

rm sound. Although my hearing, although 
as my other faculties ... deteriorate, my 
hearing becomes more acute, that is a 
particular sound which I have taught 
myself to ignore." The priest began to tap 
,re his knee with his hand. "Please I' in very 
sorry." 
Torch raised his eyes to the priest's. 
When he spoke his voice was soft. "All 
right. It's okay." 

"Well, I . .. " 

La 
"It's all right. Let the kid sleep now, 
okay Father? It's all right." 

"I'm ... Thank you. Thank you Torch." 
The priest averted his eyes, tapping his 
t knee. After a moment he looked up, 
ve smiling nervously. "Uh, you said you 
were going to the Philippines, didn't you 
t Torch? Perhaps ... I thought you might 
have some questions about the Philippines. 
' Perhaps I might be able to tell you some-
thing about them?" 

"Well . .. " 

, 
"I know something about the main 
:'s islands too. I might be able ... It's only 
the last years I've spent on, uh, Dumaran. 
Wouldn't you ... I know quite a lot about 
lS the Philippines. I've spent ... It's been 
twenty-four years, that I've spent there. 
I'd like very much, if you have any 
• questions ... " 
Torch smiled at the priest. "I would, 
Father. I'd like that. The training courses 
are pretty general. But keep your voice 
down, all right?" Torch absently caressed 
the boy's hair. 
The stewardess entered the cabin with 
0 a gin and tonic, and asked if there would 
be any more orders, they'd be landing in · 
ten minutes. 
Father Tyres took the drink. "No this 
will be fine. Thank you v~ry much. You've 
been very kind ... and courteous .. . 
throughout the flight. Thank you ... so 
very much." The priest wiped his eyes as 
the stewardess left the lounge, and raised 
his drink chest-high, staring at its contents. 

"It's really quite ... I'm surprised, really, 
at the ... gestures, which gratify me. As 
I grow older I am afraid I am becoming 
... "He looked up suddenly. "You, uh 
... Oh, the Philippines. You're going ... 
Are you, uh, going to be right in Manila 
Torch?" 

"No, in one of the smaller towns. 
Teaching high school." The boy changed 
positions in the seat, and Torch raised a 
cautioning finger to his lips. 

. 
The priest nodded. "Of course. I 
shan't ... One musn't disturb the sleep 
of children. I shan't ... " His gaze 
wandered to the window. "Manila is a very 
lovely city Torch. When I first went to 
the Philippines, oh, this was quite some 
time ago, just after the war. I remember 
it quite distinctly, for the period of time 
... Manila is a very clean city. Unlike ... " 
The priest paused. He raised the drink 
once more, hesitated, and again lowered 
it. "You're, uh, you're going to teach? 
That's fine Torch. Fine. They say, I've 
read that the Philippines have the highest 
literacy rate in all of Southeast Asia. Did 
you know that? Somewhere around 
seventy percent. But they still need ... Of 
course, the literates live for the most part 
on the main island. Where I was, for 
the last eight years; on Dumaran, oh, I 
should say that the figure would be 
around three or four percent. I should say 
that would be a correct figure." 
Torch lowered his eyes. "Father, I, my
