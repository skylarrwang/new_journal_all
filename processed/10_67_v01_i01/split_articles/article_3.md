The Success and 
Tragedy of Richard Lee 
By John Wilhelm 
JOHN WILHELM graduated from Yale 
College last June. He has lived most of his 
life in Virginia; for the lart three years he 
has been a community organizer in New 
Raven's Hill neighborhood. He is now a 
full-time volunteer for the Hill Parents 
Association. 

Introduction 
Summer 1967 was too much for liberals 
in America. When Watts exploded in 
1965, they blamed it on the 400-year 
oppression of American Negroes. The 
more widespread uprisings of 1966 pro-
duced doubts, but liberal America still 
maintained that the basic· causes were 
sociological, not criminal. 

But 1967's nationwide violence bas 
produced a new schizophrenia in the 
liberal mind. 

Whatever illusions the American people 
once had about a swift end to the war in 
Vietnam have disappeared. A new band of 
black revolutionaries has appeared at 
home, and every day this summer brought 
new suspicions that the black masses are 
folJowing their advice. Revolution abroad 
and insurrection at home: these two crises 
together pose too serious a threat to 
American stability. 

Liberal rhetoric continues, more hesi-
tantly, to assign much of the blame to the 
poverty in which one-third of America 
lives. But the suspicion grows that the 
black people have taken advantage of 
their deprivation to wreak unnecessary 
and wanton havoc. Many well-intentioned 
and capable people are working bard to 
eradicate ghettoes; "riots" simply set the 
cause back, Jiberals believe. 

In New Haven the schizophrenic re-
sponse to black rebeUion has become 
sharply defined. Liberalism has been in 
power for 14 years, and the city has be-
come nationally famous for its efforts to 
solve the urban crisis. Nevertheless, the 
city's ghettoes blew up in mid-August. 

The immediate spark for the distur-
bance was typical: a white snack bar 
owner on Congress A venue, in the Hill 
section, shot a young Puerto Rican late 
one Saturday afternoon. Puerto Ricans 
and blacks in the Hm erupted that night. 
Sunday afternoon both local and state 
police, equipped with rifles, shotguns, tear 
gas, and MACE (a new aerosol-spray 
nerve gas), deployed in large numbers in 
the city's ghettoes. That night violence 
spread throughout the city. By the time it 
stopped Wednesday night, millions of 
dollars of damage had been done, count-
less stores looted, and 500 people arrested. 

Black militants were bitter. They could 
have stopped the violence, they said, if 
Mayor Richard Lee had kept a series of 
agreements made and immediately broken 
Sunday. City Hall says the militants did 
not have enough influence among their 
own people to stop it. 

The city's basic policy was to seal off 
the black and Puerto Rican areas and 
arrest anyone who moved. Ghetto leaders 
say the people felt they were being 
counter-attacked by police, and that this 
provocation made the violence much more 
serious than it might have been. 

In late September Community Progress 
Inc., the Mayor's anti-poverty program, 
released its annual report. It was prefaced 
by a statement calied "Violence and CPl." 
Many of the "disadvantaged," the 
report said, have taken heart from New 
Raven's public dedication to progress. 
Too many, however, "look out on a world 
where their people still live in the worst 
parts of town, hold the poorest-paying 
JObs, suffer most from disease, are looked 
down on and shunned." CPI declared 
renewed war on the "privation and frustra-
tion and anguish whose continuance can 
mean recurrent violence and threats of 
violence in this and every other city." 

These sections of the CPI analysis are in 
the. best l.iberaJ tradition of recognizing 
baste soctal problems. There is a quite 
different side to the report, however; it 
reads almost as if two different people 
wrote it. 

Most of the rioters, it says, were "teen-
age hooligans" with "a thirst for revelry"; 
they were a tiny minority of the ghetto 
population. "Few if any of the incidents of 
the four days bespoke any widespread 
discontent. There is no basis for reading 
into the four-day ftareup (as a few have 
done) an Inner City-wide indictment of 
the physical and human-renewal efforts 
of 14 years." 

· 
Furthermore, "the fact is that City Hall 
and CPI are the chief militants in the 
Inner City crisis. The most strident critics 
... rarely address themselves to the most 
difficult, vexing task of meeting urgent 
day-to-day needs." 

This despite the fact that the most publi-
cized "strident critic" is Fred Harris, 
whose Hill Parents Association ran four 
CPI-funded programs this summer. CPI 
workers in the Hill readily admit the 
programs were a huge success, in particu-
lar because they were planned, adminis-
tered, and staffed almost entirely by the 
blacks and Puerto Ricans of the Hill. 

This is the liberal response to New 
Raven's rebellion. The basic sources are 
still recognized; but the Lee administration 
is unwilling to admit that anything more 
than demagogery and teenage hoodlumism 
really caused it. 

The Mayor fully intends to lend reality 
to that analysis by eliminating the 
"demagogues." Since the August uprising 
the liberal Lee administration has been 
working with that most conservative of 
governmental institutions, the FBI. Early 
this month a Federal grand jury 
subpoenaed Fred Harris and other black 
militants. Local police leaked to the press 
that the object is to put them in jail. 

Mayor Lee is making his choice. 

Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a leading 
Kennedy liberal, succinctly defined that 
choice in a speech to the Americans for 
Democratic Action last month: liberals, 
he said, must "see more clearly that their 
essential interest is in the stability of the 
social order, and that ... it is necessary to 
seek out and make much more effective 
alliance with political conservatives who 
share that concern ... " 

What Moynihan suggests nationally 
the country's most liberal Mayor is carry-
ing out locally: the "essential interest" is 
not justice but stability. Why has Mayor 
Lee made that tragic choice? Why does he 
cooperate in the effort to jail the man 
whose organization did more with 
$45,000 in one summer to involve the 
hard-core poor in constructive self-help 
programs than CPI does in a year with 
over $6 million. 

The answer lies in an examination of 
the forces the Mayor has brought together 
to keep liberalism in power.
