no implies bias. This concept of cinema 
d verite appeals to American documentary 
makers, I think, because of the self-
righteous reformist tradition in which 
ve many of them work: to show literal reality 
le is to tell it bow it is. Rough cutting, 
r. jiggling camera, poorly recorded con-
versations, bad lighting all attest to the 
truth of what is before you, a truth without 
1 the false varnish and falser order of any 
cinematic 'style.' 

In Night and Fog, Alain Resnais uses 
the pitiless gaze of the documentary 
camera as part of a complex treatment of 
.e· the Nazi death camps. Perhaps the tech-
S nique of Don't Look Back is supposed to 
mirror Dylan's own uncompromising 
1 stance. But for Pennebaker and others 
th like him, 'objectivity' is not a method; it 
b. is an ethical and aesthetic standard. 

What relation does 'objectivity' have to 
reality? Titicut Follies, a film about the 
0 Hospital for the Criminally Insane at 
Bridgewater, Mass., promised a little 
th action in the Festival. The Supreme Court 
of Massachusetts had been asked by that 
: state to issue an injunction to prevent its 
st showing. But the request was denied. 
Perhaps the keen-eyed judges bad noticed 
that the film's criticism was so diffuse 
ly and unspecific that it posed no threat. 
a, What was wrong at Bridgewater? The film 
was so studiously 'objective' that you never 
knew. Are the joke-playing guards to be 
considered as degenerate, sadistic, under-
paid or plain bored? Was the old man 
actually killed by the force-feeding? What 
is the point-of-view of the movie: fire the 
staff? build new facilities? raise every-
one's salaries? commit the psychiatrists? 
The viewer in the interest of 'objectivity' 
is left to his own devices; and as a result, 
the film is forgettable. It is poor aesthetics 
and worse journalism. Its inlages have no 
power beyond the merely horrific. 

The two worlds at the Festival came 
together for the final film, shown to the 
paying audience. This was the powerful 
and fascinating Far From Vietnam, a 
personal statement on the war by Alain 
Resnais, William Klein, Joris Ivens, 
Agnes Varda, Claude Lelouch, and Jean-
Luc Godard. Each director made his own 
sequence; but the film, put together by 
Chris Marker, shows amazing coherence 
and thematic control. 

An incident in Resnais' sequence 
recapitulated, it seemed to me, the entire 
debate over 'objectivity.' The main char-
acter is an author struggling to decide if 
he should write a scenario for Herman 
Kahn's book On Escalation: Metaphors 
and Scenarios. 

At one point he thinks of a World War 
II photograph that shows the death of a 
Japanese soldier by ftamethrower. The 
picture has been used so often by so many 
difterent people for so many different 
polemical and propaganda purposes that 
filmcutters affectionately refer to the 
photograph as Gustave. The photograph-
the cinematic 'fact'-is meaningless with-
out a context, and the contexts can be of 
any k.ind. The documentary market is 
glutted with filthy insane asylums, rat-
infested apartment houses and dilapidated 
schools. But facts alone cannot convince. 
The imaginative form, however, built on 
facts can convince. The fully articulated 
point-that is, one within a context-
paradoxically allows the facts far greater 
force than the frozen arrays of 'objec-
tivity.' 

Far From Vietnam is a remarkable film 
and deserves wide circulation, not the 
least because it brings together documen-
tary techniques with an insistence on the 
responsibility to clearly proclaim one's 
point-of-view. 'Dishonest' is more appro-
priately applied to those films that, 
through studied irrelevance and sloppy 
technique, pretend no point-of-view.

standing over the priest. "You can't do 
that. You've got no right to do that." 
The priest looked down. "I will not be 
made ... " 
"No, you can't do that.'' Torch walked 
into the passengers' section, jarring against 
those moving toward the exit. 

He returned shortly thereafter, his 
trench coat cradled on the arm which held 
his suitcase. The color had left his face, and 
when be spoke his voice was weak. He 
looked at the boy. "Hey ace, you're gonna 
stay with the stewardess for a while, 
okay? Until you get back to Chicago." The 
stewardess crouched down and asked the 
boy his name, but he ignored her, looking 
to Torch, and beginning to cry. Torch 
tried to smile. "Hey, it'll just be a couple 
of hours. You'll be back there in a little 
while." He turned to the stewardess. "Hey, 
if he doesn't cut it out don't give him 
any more beer. Okay? No more beer until 
he cuts it out." 

Torch stepped toward the door, then 
turned back to the priest. He began to 
speak, but stopped himself, and left the 
plane. 

And an hour later, having received a 
message just as he was released from 
Customs, he went to find his brother.
