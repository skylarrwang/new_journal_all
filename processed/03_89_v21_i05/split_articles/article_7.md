Kicking Out the Habit 
Megan Chambers 
Two people arrested recently for 
purchasing drugs in a New Haven 
·public housing development received a 
blunt, one-page letter in the mail a few 
days later. The letter began: "Dear 
Arrestee, We got your name and 
address from the newspaper. We are a 
group of concerned tenants who live in 
public housing. We are 'Tenants 
Against Drugs Dammit! !' It means 
just that: we're totally against the 
selling of drugs in our neighborhood. 
You're making our job tough." 

This letter marks the most recent 
efforts of TADD!!, a group of tenant 
activists formed to fight drug dealing 
in six Housing Authority of New 
Haven (HANH) developments. Last 
June the Coalition for People, a non-
profit group that helps citizens address 
local problems, 
put 
together the 
T ADD!! initiative with the tenant 
councils of Eastview, Elm Haven, 
Farnum, Rockview, Waverly, and 
Quinnipiac T errace. Virginia Henry, 
a 
long-time 
tenant 
activist at 
Quinnipiac T errace and a custodian at 
Yale, agreed to chair this operation. 
TADD!! calls on tenants, HAN H , and 
the New Haven police to create safe, 
drug-free public housing. 

· .Only two months after its inception, 
T ADD!! saw its first results: new 
outdoor lighting, the eviction of some 
dealers, and a commitment from the 
New Haven Police Department 
(NHPD) for increased survillance. Since 
then, tenants have organized their own 
patrols to monitor and to report drug 
activity, and HANH has begun to 
clean up the vacant apartments where 
many dealers stash and sell their drugs.

Most recently, TADD!! began tar-
geting the buyers by sending a letter to 
those arrested in the developments; it 
plans next to picket buyers' homes. 
Eventually TADD!! hopes to establish 
tenant committees to screen ·pro-
spective residents. 

Over the past ten years, the marked 
increase in gun possession and drug-
related crime in New Haven has hit 
HANH developments hard. Henry 
recalls Quinnipiac Terrace's attractive 
condition when she arrived in the mid-
Seventies. "When I moved in here, it 
"Those are some 
dangerous guys out 
there. That's part of 
why we're keeping 
people in the patrol a 
secret." 
was beautiful," she said. "It really was." 
The developmen"ts have rapidly 
deteriorated since then, as the drug 
crisis has mounten. Spraypainted 
entryways, scattered trash, and 
boarded-up windows now mar Quin-
nipiac Terrace. By last spring, Henry 
said, drugs were so ·prevalent that 
dealers were selling out in the open. 

The letter sent to buyers describes 
the threat drug dealing poses to 
tenants: "A drug deal went bad, shots 
are being fired at random and an 
innocent child is injured. There are 
more shots fired, a bullet shatters a 
window entering an apartment and 
misses an elderly lady by inches." 

Because of the ever-present danger, 
public transportation stopped servicing 
many of the developments, eliminating 
the only way for residents to get to 
school or to work. 

Feeling 
trapped, 
TADD!! 
representatives brought their anti-drug 
dealing plan before HANH, NHPD, 
and the state Housing Commission. As 
a result, Police Chief William Farrell 
promised to supply each development 
with three officers to conduct round-
the-clock surveillance over a two-week 
period. NHPD then extended its patrol 
to three weeks and added a fourth 
officer. The department also gave 
T ADD!! activists a special number to 
call if they saw any drug activity. 

Major Daniel Blackmon, head of 
NHPD Community Affairs Division 
and liason to T ADD!!, praises the 
tenants' efforts 
to improve their 
neighborhood. 
According 
to 
Blackmon, after two decades of citizens' 
closing their shutters on crime, 
T ADD!! is sending a message to the 
community to get involved. 

Getting involved in the New Haven 
drug crisis, however, has its dangers. 
Tenants in the Eastview TADD!! 
received several threats of retaliation from 
dealers last fall. Although no other 
tenant has since received an intimi-
dating notice, only Henry feels secure 
enough to act openly as a tenant 
patroller. "Those are some dangerous 
guys out there," Henry said. "That's 
part of why we're keeping people in the 
patrol 
secret." The undercover 
lookouts keep watch while taking

children to the park or visiting a 
neighbor. 

The police have had a more visible 
role in the TADD!! program. Accord-
ing to Henry, police surveillance and 
TADD!!'s community efforts have led 
to a decrease in drug trafficking in 
Quinnipiac Terrace since June. Police 
officers have also been conducting 
sting 
operations 
since 
last 
March- posing as dealers in 27 loca-
tions arotJnd New Haven, including 
the six TADD!! developments. Last 
October undercover officers arrested 
102 buyers in a single day in the Hill 

But Blackmon points out that 
chasing dealers out of one area doesn't 
solve the larger drug problem. "What 
we're doing is basically moving them 
around. From the standpoint of a 
person in that neighborhood you've 
had some impact, but from our 
perspective it's like a treadmill," he 
said. With T ADD!! developments still 
on this treadmill, tenant activists have 
asked the police to return for a second 
period of round-the-clock enforce-
ment. 

Because T ADD!! members have 
succeeded in drawing attention to their 
needs, 
they could make a 
long-
term difference. Warren Gould, vice-
chairman of the Youth Services 
Bureau in New Haven, feels that 
T ADD!! 
offers the 
most 
viable 
response to the drug crisis. "Com-
munity organizing is the bottom line," 
Gould 
said. "If everyone in 
community .were able to stand up with 
the kind of courage that TADD!! did, 
we could truly begin to put a dent in 
this drug problem." Gould feels that 
other groups need to adopt T ADD! !'s 
grass-roots approach. He envisions a 
coalition of churches, 
politicians, 
community groups, labor organi-
zations, and businesses working to 
create a permanent solution. 

Blackmon agrees that TADD!! has 
taken the right approach. He readily 
admits that 
the dealers can 
be 
dangerous, but he knows that the 
police cannot solve the drug problem 
alone. "I think that in today's society 
it's dangerous to be a citizen. Citizens 
Virginia Henry 
won't stand for 
drugs on her 
doorstep. 
have to understand that they have to 
stop and take a stand," he said. 

TADD!! has met that challenge with 
dedication and ingenuity, and even 
some threats of its own. Its letter to 
buyers ends with this warning: 
"We're tired of suffering in violence, 
While you're at home in bed. 
Don't be afraid of the dealers, 
Beware of the tenants instead."
