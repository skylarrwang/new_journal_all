Adjusted Focus 
Ruth Conniff 
From his basement office in the Yale 
Co-op, Security Director Rob Abrams 
is watching. He can see everything that 
happens in the Co-op's three buildings 
on his six television screens. "We have 
sprinkler heads that are really closed路 
circuit cameras, one-way mirrors, and 
vents people can hide behind with 
binoculars," Abrams said. He demon-
strated 
the cameras' preCisiOn, 
zooming in on a cashier's watch to read 
the time. By switching from camera to 
camera on his monitors, Abrams can 
follow 
customer throughout the 
store. If he sees something suspicious, 
he alerts a Co-op security guard by 
radio. Recently he saw a well-dressed 
woman wander in and bend over near 
a rack of gloves. "Within three seconds 
the whole rack- about $400-worth-
was gone," Abrams said. Using an 
electronic system, the Co-op retrieves 
$800 in merchandise each month. "I 
just can't understand why closed-
circuit isn't here at Yale." 

Modern security devices are slowly 
making their way into Yale University. 
"Security companies have 
been 
peppering us with offers," said 
Assistant Secretary Radley Daly. "It's 
quite clear that electronic security 
systems are here and now." Installing 
such a system in a community of over 
15,000 presents logistical problems. 

But electronic security raises even 
more 
difficult questions for 
an 
institution concerned 
not 
with 
merchandise, but with people. 

The prospect of closed-circuit 
cameras at every residential college 
gate poses a threat to students' privacy. 
"If we have a record of who is entering 
which building at any given time, 
whose business is that?" Daly asked. 

High-tech security apparatuses evoke 
images of 1984 and represent the 
intrusion of impersonal technology 
into private life. 

This invasion would be particularly 
anomalous given Yale's history. "One 
Officer James Donnelley founded the Yale Police force in 1894 and 
prevented undergraduates from burning down the campus.

of the best things about security here 
was that there was always a warm 
relationship between the campus cops 
and the students," said Yale Professor 
of Architecture Vincent Scully OE 
'40). Up until 1972 a civilian guard sat 
路 in the office just inside the main gate of 
each 
residential college. Guards 
checked to make sure that students 
didn't bring their girlfriends into the 
colleges after hours. "In a funny way, 
security was better then than it is now," 
Scully said. "There was always a guard 
at the college gate and you spoke with 
him as you came in." 

Traditionally, civilian guards and 
the Yale Police were concerned with 
protecting Yale students from 
themselves, and New Haven from 
Yale students. In 1894, two New 
Haven police officets crossed the 
Green to establish the Yale Police 
force. Their main job was to prevent 
students from setting fire to the rubble 
of Old Brick Row, which had been 
torn down to make room for Old 
Campus. 

Until 1975, the Yale Police did not 
wear uniforms. Most wore fedora hats 
~ and trench coats. "The big joke back 
~ then was the man in the trench coat," 
~ said Yale Police Commander George 
~ Denison. "The kids all knew who we 
: were, even though we weren't in 
i uniform. We stood out like a sore 
~ thumb." Denison joined the Yale 
~ Police force in 1958. "When I first 
~ came, our biggest job was keeping 
~ students from committing acts of 
i:l vandalism in the colleges and on the 
~ city streets," he said. "We used to pick 
~ up kids who were drunk and take them 
~ back to their rooms." As the Uni路 
~ versity's political climate changed over 
~ the next 30 years, so did the role of the 
:- Yale Police. Conflicts like the anti路 
~ Vietnam protests and the recent anti-
8 apartheid demonstrations created a 
~ division between students and police.
