Mistaken Identity 
The term Hispanic as used in the 
1980's collectively designates the 
various peoples of Latin American 
descent within the United States. First 
used in the 1980 census, the term was 
picked up by the media and govern-
ment as a catchall point of reference. It 
was, unfortunately, accepted by some 
Latinos without complaint who then 
used it to describe themselves. Yet 
what appears on the surface to be an 
innocent and useful way to identify 
people of Latin-American extraction, 
the term Hispanic has significant and 
troubling ideological implications. 

Not the least of these, is the 
intent- conscious or not- to counter 
the ethnic nationalism of Latinos such 
as Chicanos and Puerto Ricans whose 
movements, beginning back in the 
1960's, were perceived to be potentially 
threatening to the U.S. class and racial 
order. Used as part of a countervailing 
strategy, the term Hispanic is intended 
to produce a new form of hegemony by 
imposing an external definition of 
what it has meant to be a Latino in the 
United States. Rather than conveying 
the uniqueness of the Latino culture 
and its history of oppression and 
subordination in a rigid class and 
racial system such as the United States, 
the term Hispanic conveys a quite 
different message. That message is one 
of conformity to the U.S. system, the 
discarding of traditional "cultural 
baggage," and the placing of the 
Hispanic experience within the process 
of assimilation with the promised result 
being attainment of the American 
Dream. 

路 .It is perhaps no coincidence that the 
term Hispanic originated during the 
years of the Reagan Administration 
and the rise to power of the Far Right. 
Like the Reagan myth of the resur-
gence 
of 
the 
quintessential 
American- the self-made person- the 
term Hispanic in a Reaganesque sense 
seeks to convert Latinos into believing 
in such a myth and to abandon more

aggressive and, in fact, independent 
measures to achieve self-deter-
mination. Unlike earlier terms of self-
identification such as Mexicano, 
Hispano, Mexican American, Latino, 
and Chicano, the term Hispanic is not 
organic to the Chicano or Latino 
experience. It is an 
artifical and 
abstract creation that, in the context of 
Reagan's world view, represents a new 
form of repressive ideological control. 

Yet 
unlike earlier efforts at 
ideological control which denied racial 
minorities an identity and even a 
place in American history'路 .the 
Hispanic movement-if we can call it 路 
that- is a more seductive concept in 
that it credits racial minorities with a 
proper place in a pluralistic America. 
The idealized image of the United 
States as an ethnically and culturally 
pluralistic society replaced the older 
路 melting pot idea as the prevailing view 
in the 1960's. This view helped to 
shape the formulation of what could be 
called nationality policy. 

Given the explosion of the African-
American civil rights movement and 
the subsequent revolt by other 
repressed 
nationalities 
such as 
Chicanos which gave lie to the concept 
of the melting pot, pluralism became 
the obvious ideological response to 
meet the challenges of the Sixties. The 
concept of pluralism, of course, is 
embedded in a dialectic. On the one 
hand, it is the result of genuine efforts 
by national minorities to gain 
recognition and a voice as distinct 
ethnic and cultural entities and to 
achieve self-determination in a society 
which has robbed them of their history, 
their identity, and their sense of self-
worth. On the other hand, pluralism 
represented, in the context of the 
1960's, a reformist effort by the liberal 
section of the ruling sector to respond 
to the crisis posed by the nationality 
question. The ruling sector sought to 
regain 
ideological and 
political 
hegemony by conceding particular 
political and economic reforms coupled 
with cultural recognition of various 
national minorities. 

For this pluralistic nationality policy 
to 
succeed, 
however, 
the federal 
government had to play an active role 
in furthering reforms necessitating

the courts. The reaction to such a 
nationality policy on the part of the 
conservative wing of the ruling sector 
became clear in the 1970's with the 
slowing down of such reforms. How-
ever, the greatest challenge clearly 
came with the election of Reagan in 
1980. While the Reagan counter-
re~mation aimed at eliminating or 
substantially reducing the reforms and 
the power won by the struggles of 
national minorities and of women, 
gays, the poor, etc. it could not fully 
restore the older melting pot ideology 
still favored by _ the Far Right- the 
ideology they regard as being the best 
form of control with regard to 
nationality policy. The melting pot 
provides the masses and particular 
excluded groups with a simple, cynical 
creed- the promise that if they work 
hard enough, prove their loyalty, and 
accept the dominant culture and 
values, that they in time will achieve 
the full American Dream. Reagan's 
nationality policy conveys the melting 
pot message but at the same time 
appropriates the reform veneer of the 
pluralist concept. 

The conservative agenda for ethnic 
America is perhaps best put forward by 
economist Thomas Sowell of the 
Hoover Insititute at Stanford Uni-
versity in his book Ethnic America: A 
History, published in 1981. Sowell's 
vision of ethnic America is based on 
four major but historically false 
premises. First, Sowell contends that 
ethnicity rather than class and race is 
at the center of American history. 
Hence, divisions and struggles have to 
do with the myriad of ethnic groups 
adjusting to one another and pursuing 
a process which Sowell terms "ethnic 
succession." Ethnic groups- including 
Europeans, Africans, Mexican, and 
Asians-have to tearn to co-exist with 
one another in a dynamic capitalist 
system which can accommodate all of 
them. Class is not particularly crucial 
in Sowell's analysis since for the most 
part he sees few class lines or barriers 
to restrict mobility. 

Second, that while ethnic and racial 
discrimination has existed it has been 
minor compared to other societies. 
Sowell views racism as only a passing 
historical phenomena and one which 
has not been fundamental in pre-
venting socio-economic mobility. 
Moreover, what racial barriers to 
mobility have existed have been mostly 
eliminated. Third, that despite certain 
differences, all ethnic groups, 
including African-Americans and 
Latinos, have shared in the fruits of the 
American system. 
As he argues 
"perhaps the most striking pattern 
among American ethnic groups is their 
general rise in economic conditions 
with the passage of time." And, 
fourth, 
Sowell suggests that if some 
ethnic groups have gained greater 
mobility and standing, it is more the 
result of those groups- such as 
Western European- having arrived 
earlier and hence acquiring a head-
start over later immigrants. 

Sowell attributes the more inferior 
Mexican-American economic standing 
as due to a lack of political leadership; 
high and persistent fertility rates; 
continued use of Spanish; fewer efforts 
at becoming naturalized U.S. citizens; 
and the low priority given to edu-
