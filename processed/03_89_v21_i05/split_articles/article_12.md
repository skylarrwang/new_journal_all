Prevented by law from selling his own beer, Rick Elser (BR '81) leans on the state legislature.

the close ties between community and 
company. 
Potts takes a lesson from this his-
tory. He understands the volatility of 
the beer market. "Initially, we had this 
half-assed idea that we'd have pots 
sitting on big stoves while we walked 
around in white coats and people 
exclaimed, 'Oh wow, dudes. Check it 
out. They're making beer.'" But Potts 
soon realized that beer brewing was 
more complicated than a high school 
science experiment. "It's one thing to 
want to be a brewer; it's another to go 
into business," he said. After four years 
of research and planning, he now feels 
well-prepared to launch his venture. 
In the beer marketplace where the 
retailer has over 1,200 brands to 
choose from, a badly marketed product 
may die in anonymity. In hopes of 
avoiding this fate, NHBC has hired 
two marketing directors to design a 
sales strategy. They will 
take a 
conservative tack: produce only one 
kind of beer in limited quantities, 
distribute very locally, concentrate on 
getting draught lines in bars, and 
eventually add bottles. With four years 
of retailing experience at Richter's, 
Potts is aware that NHBC must hit 
both retailers and customers with 
thorough advertising. "Beer doesn't sell 
itself," Potts said. "When you're in the 
package store looking for something, it 
doesn't just grow little feet and follow 
you around until you get frustrated 
and say, 'Oh, I'll buy this one.'" 
But for Connecticut Ale to reach the 
shelf, NHBC needs money. Raising 
capital, though, 
is 
difficult 
for 
microbreweries. "Microbreweries tend 
to be capitalized on a shoestring," Elser 
explained. "It's very hard for investors 
to understand how someone can come 
to them, propose sales equivalent to 
what some of the larger operations ship 
in a day, and think they're going to be 
able to take the same profit margin." 
With many avenues of investment 
closed, NHBC has tumed to limited-
partnership arrangements.
