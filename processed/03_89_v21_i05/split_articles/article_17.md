EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Phillip Ritterbush (SM '58) managed to pay half his tuition working in the JE print shop. poorly-ventilated print shops. Last spring Katherine Weese (SY.'88) spent several days in a row standing on the concrete floor of the Saybrook press. She was trying furiously to complete her assignment for a college seminar, The Art of the Book. Her dedication to printing resulted in a three-day stay at University Health Services while her knees and ankles healed. 
Although Weest!s injuries were exceptional, all students in the class found the requirement to make their own book exacting. Esme Howard (MC '89), who also took the course last spring, pulled several all-nighters to complete a book about ampersands(&) and dedications. 

In her preface Howard explains her topic: "And" is by far the most appealing of conjunctions-no contradictions, no divisions, no qualifications. With enough ampersands one could (theoretically at least) connect the whole world." Such whimsey colored many of the books from the seminar and stems from a printing tradition that makes irreverence an obligation. 

Perhaps JE printers fulfill this duty with the most dedication. Last year someone put up posters attacking the Yale College Council, suggesting students "Kiss Bogus Student Government Goodbye." The pair of red lips brandishing the inflammatory farewell came from a linoleum block printed at the JE press. A year before that, other JE printers decided to dupe freshpeople by producing phony invitations to the Skull and Bones tomb. The night of the event, a crowd showed up outside, cameras in hand, and waited to be admitted. 

The Honourable Company of College Printers gathers to tell of antics like these at the Wayzgoose Dinner every April. This event continues a European tradition where, according to printing lore, apprentices become journeymen-fully-trained printers. 

An explanation of the ceremony's name comes from Random Notes on the Origin of the College Presses, printed at the JE press in 1967. This document claims, "The word wayze means bundle of straw and wayzgoose, a stubble goose- properly the crowning dish of the entertainment." 

This occasion includes a speech by a professional printer or graphic artist and the awarding of the Lohman prize. This coveted award, named after former Yale secretary and printing aficionado Carl Lohman, honors the best piece of undergraduate printing. Dawn Bravato (SY '89), current master printer of Saybrook's Underbrook Press, feels that failing to submit to the Lohman contest indicates a shamefully inactive press. 

All printers attending the dinner receive keepsakes, small bits of memorabilia printed on one of the presses. The keepsake for the last Wayzgoose dinner included the lyrics to a song first sung at the Printer's Festival on April 14, 1848: 
Each Printer lives himself a king, 
A monarch in his might . . .. 
Our mystic art will bear its part 
of glory and reknown. 

Speakers at the Wayzgoose are often college press alumni who have turned their experience in the basement print shops into successful careers in printing or design. Lance Hidy (OE '68), now a well-known graphic designer, has attended the Wayzgoose dinner several times. Former undergraduate printer Charles Altschul also returns regularly for the event. Altschul, whose grandfather designed the Times Roman typeface, passes his knowledge onto students by teaching on occasion The Art of the Book. 

When alumni return next year, they may find that some things have changed. With the planned remodeling of Calhoun, the college printers may lose their Washington Handpress, a press that predates all others at the University. The University will either move the press to the Pierson print shop or sell it- a loss the printing community would regret. Old presses, parts, and type faces are becoming increasingly scarce as the printing industry focuses on improving computer technology. 

Some senior members of the Yale printing community wish the University would increase its support for the presses. Polly Lada-Moscarski, graphic design professor and godmother of the JE press, feels Yale does not pay enough attention to this archaic craft. As she puts it, "Yale presses need more press." 

Perhaps more students will acquire an interest in letterpress printing and a penchant for perennially blackened fingers. Those who have made printing their profession hope that they will. Hoover, involved in printing for most of his life, praises the craft: It allows someone to make physical an abstract idea, impressing ink onto paper without alienating the printer from the method. Hoover still marvels that wood fiber and plant dyes can become a shakespearean sonnet.
