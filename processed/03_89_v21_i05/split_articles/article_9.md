High-tech security 
apparatuses evoke 
images of 1984. 
Morse colleges were designed without 
gates by Architect Eero Saarinen in 
1959. Saarinen wanted members of the 
surrounding community to come in 
and mix freely with the students on 
campus. The architect died before the 
colleges were built, however, and the 
University insisted on installing gates. 
Saarinen's widow allowed the gates to 
be built but stipulated that they could 
never be locked. But over the past 20 
years, crime in New Haven has 
increased dramatically. In the last five 
years alone aggravated assaults have 
risen from 632 incidents to 1,474. 


Today, the gates of Stiles and Morse 
are always locked. "It's very sad," said 
Scully, who was Master of Morse 
College from 1969 to 1974. "There is a 
real problem between security and the 
desire to have open relations to the 
town." 

Locks instead of guards and uni-
forms 
instead of trench coats 
foreshadow 
a 
complete electronic 
security system at Yale. Already at the 
Yale School of Medicine, a desk 
attendant monitors seven closed-circuit 
cameras located at buildings 
throughout 
the 
medical school, 
including the morgue. Anyone who

cameras in 1981, and a card-access 
system at two central buildings soon 
followed. "We're trying to have our 
security system as apparent as 
possible," 
Security Manager Joan 
Goddard said. Ac.cording to Goddard, 
medical school students and faculty 
have responded well to the new system. 
"This is a very obvious sign that we are 
doing something. 
I 
think people 
appreciate that," she said. 

How cameras will affect residential 
life at Yale has yet to be seen. Cameras 
like those at the medical school may 
soon appear in the undergraduate 
colleges, although the administration 
will not say when. "We're not ruling 
anything out. 
We are constantly 
modernizing and changing the security 
system 
here," said 
Yale 
Police 
Assistant Commander Donald 
Ferguson. 

At present, the mam form of 
electronic security at Yale is the 
button. Panic buttons hide under desks 
in busy administrative offices and 
hold-up buttons are close at hand in 
offices dealing with a lot of money. 
These buttons set off an alarm on the 
police dispatcher's computer and the 
location of the trouble flashes on the 
screen. This semester, the University 
police 
finished 
installing 
radio 
communications system that provides 
patrol officers with their own 
emergency buttons. The dispatcher's 
computer monitors more than 300 
alarms all together. Last year, Yale 
Police responded to 1,432 burglar 
alarms and 85 steam-tunnel, hold-up, 
and panic alarms. 

While Yale responds to alarms, the 
Co-op is developing a focused plan of 
attack. 
Abrams 
is assembling a 
training film of shoplifters in action for 
all store employees. The Co-op has 
had 45 people arrested for shoplifting 
in the past six months and a 500 
percent increase in arrests since last 
year. Workers are becoming adept at 
protecting the Co-op. "It's almost to 
the point now where my staff knows 
who belongs here and who doesn't," 
Abrams said. 

But Yale can't just identify 
suspicious people and lock them out. 
Neither can it Jock its students in. 
Administrators say they are trying to 
improve security without creating a 
hostile environment. "The emphasis 
here should be on students getting 
around, seeing friends, crossing city 
streets," Daly said. "I certainly don't 
want to see some kind of armed camp 
with big fences and search lights. I 
don't think anyone wants to see that." 

While 
University 
is 
working 
toward a balanced solution, the Yale 
Co-op remains the safest building on 
campus.
