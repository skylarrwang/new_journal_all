THOMAS C. DUFFY 
MUSIC DIRECTOR 
YALE CONCERT BAND 
The Yale Concert Band is made up of approximately eighty musicians selected from the better 
brass, wind, and percussion players at the University. The Concert Band's repertoire ranges 
from standard marches, classical transcriptions, 
and the time-honored standards of symphonic 
band literature to contemporary and theater 
works for band including music commissioned 
specifically for the group. A recent Yale Band 
commission, Steven Stucky's Voyages for Cello and 
Winds, was nominated for the 1985 Pulitzer Prize 
in music. This January, the Concert Band performed for President George Bush in the 1989 
Presidential Inaugural Parade.
