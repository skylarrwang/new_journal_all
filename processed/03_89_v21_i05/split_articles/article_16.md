Pressed For Time 
Stefan ie Syman 
Astro red and green wash the 
walls of Yale Station, yet the bright 
colors attract only passing glances. 
Sometimes a 
poster printed with 
mustard or maroon ink stands out in 
this sea of neon and later winds up on a 
dorm room wall. The Honourable 
Company of College Printers creates 
these posters on residential college 
letterpresses. These undergraduates 
spend hours in subterranean print 
shops perfecting their craft, working 
without modern machinery and within 
a dying tradition. 

Before the mid-Sixties, the Uni-
versity printed every table tent, flyer, 
and even the 
Yale 
Banner on a 
letterpress. Now the letterpresses have 
the status of a revival theater, pro-
ducing quality work on a small scale 
while preserving the craft of printing. 
Both older printers' nostalgia and a 
younger generation's fascination for 
printing keep the 11 college presses 
alive. At Yale, letterpress printing has 
survived technological revolutions and 
spawned a creative subculture. 
Timothy Owight and Jonathan 
Edwards colleges 
each claim 
the 
distinction of having had the first print 
shop. Although both opened their 
doors in 1936, TD actually started 
operations three months before JE. 
The donation of a 
letterpress, 
originally intended for printing 
missionary tracts in China, allowed 
Branford students to establish their 
own print shop in 1941. Over the next 
35 years, the other colleges acquired 
presses-except Morse, which shares 
with Ezra Stiles. Once a college was 
equipped with a press, it paid its 
students to print invitations, menus, 
and diplomas. Phillip Ritterbush (SM 
'58) managed to pay half his tuition 
working in the JE print shop. 
Carl Purington Rollins set the tone 
for .all Yale printing. He was the first 
Univesity printer, 
a 
professional 
responsible for filling Yale's printing 
needs. Rollins, still recognized for his 
virtuosity, showed students that good 
printing requires both technique and 
artistry. From 1920 to 1948 Rollins 
was responsible for every piece of 
printed material except for the exit 
signs. 

Eventually students began 
bringing him magazines, invitations, 
and theater programs to design and 
print. 

Roland Hoover (YC '49) became 
University printer in March of 1984. 
Since 
then, 
Hoover 
has 
acted as the shepherd of the college 
presses. Yale printers consider him 
irreplaceable because of his extensive 
knowledge of the machinery and his 
dedication to undergraduate printing. 
Among his 
activities, 
attends bimonthly printing tables 
where the HonourableCompany dis-
cusses current printing events and 
problems. After these meals, Hoover 
will pay a visit to a college print shop, 
roll up his sleeves, and repair a broken 
press if necessary. In the print shop he 
expounds the advantages of letterpress 
versus laser printing. Besides pro-
ducing sharper letters, the letterpress 
gives students direct contact with the 
press. By working with the actual bits
