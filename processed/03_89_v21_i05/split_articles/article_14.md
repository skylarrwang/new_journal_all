A Major 
Revision

Tension has been building in the 
History department. Students in the 
most popular undergraduate major are 
worried about their senior essays. 
Many of the 250 seniors whose essays 
are due at 4 p.m., April 17 complain 
that they are ill-prepared and poorly 
guided. Because of these problems, 
what could be the culmination of a 
history major's academic career often 
becomes what History Professor John 
Boswell 
calls "a 
perfunctory and 
miserable experience." 
Steve Gillon, director of the Senior 
Departmental Essay Program for the 
History department, will admit that there 
are significant problems with the current 
program. 
He blames overcrowding, 
pointing out that the number of 
undergraduate 
history majors has 
jumped 25 percent in the past eight 
years. At the same time, because of budget 
cuts, the number of history professors 
has dropped 30 percent. But many 
students 
feel 
that 
the 
program's 
deficiencies extend beyond the 
problem of overcrowding. They fault 
the department 
for providing 
inadequate preparation and few 
guidelines. 
The major requires that students 
take two junior seminars, which are 
intended to acquaint students with 
historical methodology. 
Yet many 
students complain that these seminars 
do not provide the research skills that 
the senior essay demands. One of 
Hannah 
Caspar's (SY '89) junior 
seminars required only a ten-page 
paper based entirely on secondary 
sources. "How is that supposed to 
prepare me?" she asked. Charles Weed 
(TC '89) feels 
that his 
lack of 
experience with primary sources has 
been a major obstacle. 
Already in unfamiliar territory, 
seniors quickly find that there are few 
guidelines to help them navigate the
