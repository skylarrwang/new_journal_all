"People have been looking through our 
garbage," Blair Potts (BK '84) said 
smugly. He gestured to a small black 
box on the floor of his office on College 
Street. "Th_at's why we bought a paper 
shredder." Potts has a lot to conceal in 
his refuse, including 27 experimental 
beer formulas and his strategy for 
becoming Connecticut's only commer-
cial brewer. Since he opened a book on 
homebrewing four years ago, he has 
developed a whimsical notion into a 
full-fledged business. Potts' enterprise, 
the New Haven Brewing Company 
(NHBC), will put Connecticut Ale on 
tap by July. With an initial annual 
production of 3,000 barrels distributed 
within 25 miles of New Haven, NHBC 
Will join the fastest-growing sector of 
the beer industry: microbrewing. 

Microbreweries, which by definition 
less than 15,000 31-gallon 
a year, first sprang up in the 
Northwest in the 1970's. There 
now over 55 
microbreweries 
wide, including three in New 
,,_;,'"KI.ana. According to the Association 
Brewers, at least ten more micro-
Dn:wf:ri~~l'l will start making beer by the 
of the year. 

Although these companies can't

-

in a year what Anheuser-
pumps out in 90 minutes- they 
can cater to a niche of consumers not 
satisfied by the middle-of-the-road 
tastes of the major brands. This group 
of beer drinkers has traditionally 
turned to impor~d beers to satisfy its 
demanding palate. Microbreweries 
bring specialty beer production closer 
to home. They currently control less 
than one percent of the country's total 
beer sales, while importers hold seven 
percent,

dominate the rest. "People have gotten 
locked into the idea that beer has to be 
made by a company somewhere else," 
Potts said. "The appeal that micro-
breweries play to is a fresh, local 
product." 

The recent surge in popularity of 
microbrews also reflects a general 
enthusiasm for specialty foods and 
dietary temperance. "The movement 
ties in with nouveau svelte American 
cuisine and fern bars," said Alan 
Eames, brewery designer, author of 
A Beer Drinker's Companion, and beer 
anthropologist. "We are definitely in a 
neo-Prohibition frame of mind that 
alcohol in any form is poison. So we 
are going to drink less but better 
quality. Now you can be moderately 
trendy, and drink a real kick-ass beer." 

Potts observed this shift toward less 
common brews in 1984 while mana-
ging Richter's, a bar and restaurant on 
Chapel Street owned by former Yale 
lightweight-crew coach Rick Elser (BR 
'81). Potts and Elser were disappointed 
at first when they noticed that people 
were coming in only for the beer rather 
than for the atmosphere. "We didn't 
want to run a beer hall," Potts said. 
"But then we noticed they were coming 
in for the imported beer." Richter's 
filled all its draught lines with imported 
beer in 1985, and the following year 
drained 900 half-kegs, 22 times the 
average number for a oar its size. 

Seeing an opportunity to chip away 
at the import market, Potts and Elser 
decided to make their own brew. They 
figured that they could offer a unique-
tasting beer and, at the same time, 
satisfy those looking for a 
local 
product. Elser hoped to turn Richter's 
into a brewpub, a bar that sells its own 
brew, but he discovered that Con-
necticut state law prevented him as a
