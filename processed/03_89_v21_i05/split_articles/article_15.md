essay process. The information that 
students and their advisors receive 
from the Hi-story department is vague, 
describing the essay as "interpretive 
and analytical, rather than merely 
narrative ." In addition, 
the 
department imposes three deadlines 
for the submission of work in progress. 
But since the students present all work 
directly to their advisor, the individual 
professor can replace or dismiss the 
deadlines. In the decentl:alized senior 
essay program, professors exercise full 
control over the essay's course. 


These flaws are apparent as early as 
junior year when many history 
students begin to scramble for essay 
advisors. With nearly 240 history 
majors per class and only 50 history 
professors, competition 
is keen. 


The department does not require 
faculty to advise essays. While most 
do, some refuse the task, making the 
shortage of advisors more pronounced. 
A few professors in popular con-
centrations find themselves in great 
demand. Over half of the students 
choose to write on American subjects, 
but only 20 percent of the history 
professors specialize in American 
history. 


As long as students are 
allowed to choose their own topics, 
some will be more popular than others. 
But the extreme overcrowding of the 
history major has made this natural 
imbalance more severe. 


Gillon cannot guarantee students an 
advisor whose area of interest matches 
their own. Nevertheless, he claims that 
the program will give seniors "the 
direction and guidance of a faculty 
member." But Gillon's assurance does 
not Â·promise the student an advisor 
from the History department: Some 
seniors must search other departments 
in order to find a faculty member with 
enough time to advise them. And the 
shortage of available professors forces 
some seniors to rely on graduate 
students. Ultimately, the program 
guarantees the stJ,ldent an advisor from 
somewhere in the University. What it 
does not guarantee is the direction that 
the advisor's guidance will take. 


Although professors are expected to 
comply with the department's 
requirements, 
their loose inter-
pretations of these guidelines has 
meant that seniors' workloads vary widely. 
The department will defer to the 
professor to 
dic~ate the workload, 
respecting individual teaching styles. 
According to Boswell, "It's really up to 
the teacher whether he wants to make 
the student jump through hoops." 


Professor Henry Turner requires 
Caspar to turn in ten pages of writing 
every week. On the other hand, 
Professor Gaddis Smith asks for only 
minimal work from Marshal Morgan 
(TC '89). "Gaddis doesn't make any 
demands on my time at all," he said. 


Even though Gillon recognizes that 
these discrepancies exist, he says that it 
is the student's responsiblity to find an 
advisor with a compatible approach to 
the essay. But with the competition for 
an advisor as tight as it is, Gillon's 
advice is hardly practical. 


The advisor's control extends 
beyond deadlines to the methodology 
of the essay. There are no set criteria 
for the use of primary sources, and 
students complain that the expect-
ations change 
from 
professor 
to 
professor. Weed has found that while 
many professors feel the senior essay 
should revolve around research of 
primary documents, 
his professor 
expects 
a 
paper that 
is 
more 
historiographical. Teddy Keirn (DC 
'89) has worked with two professors of 
opposite methodological approaches, 
and has felt pressure from both sides. 
"One professor told me not to even 
think of looking at secondary sources 
until I had totally evaluated the 
primary sources," Keirn said. "The 
other told me it was silly to deal with 
the primary sources until I became 
familiar with the secondary material." 


Although students are voicing 
complaints, the History department 
has no intention of altering the 
program. In the last two years the 
department has twice voted down a 
change in the essay. Faculty members 
believe the theory behind the program 
is sound. "History is the art of putting 
things together, and you must learn 
how hard it is to reconstruct history by 
doing it yourself," Boswell said. "And 
so, writing a senior essay proves so 
essential. It's the only way to leave 
your undergraduate education know-
ing anything about history." 


One proposal students have made is 
that the University should hire more 
professors. But the administration does 
not want to pay for a larger faculty. 
Some students have also suggested 
dropping the essay requirement al-
together, or shortening the program to 
one semester. With a one-semester 
requirement, 
they point out that 
professors could advise twice as many 
essays. Many students also feel they 
can complete the program in one 
semester. 


But 
like 
many of his 
colleagues, History Professor William 
Cronon remains unconvinced of the 
meri~s of the one-semester essay. "The 
ultimate. point of the history major is 
for the student to see history as creative 
and constructive," he explained. "And 
for the student to achieve the necessary 
amount of insight requires two terms 


of research and writing." 


Eric Weinberger (SM '89), a former 
member of the Student Advisory 
Board for the History Major, has 
proposed a compromise of sorts: a two-
track major. An honors track would 
require a two-semester essay; a regular 
track would require either a one-
semester essay or a senior seminar. "A 
lot of studen!s just aren't interested in 
writing a two-semester essay," he said. 


Gillon likes Weinberger's proposal but 
doesn't feel the senior essay program 
needs overhauling. According to 
Gillon, the major "creaks along, slowly 
stumbling, but gets where it needs to 
go. It's not as bad as it's made out to 
be." 


Gillon has instead proposed more 
moderate repairs. He has announced 
that juniors will have to attend a 
workshop on methodology before 
signing up for an advisor this spring. 
Gillon hopes that such a requirement 
will teach students how to research 
with 
primary sources. But it 
questionable whether a 
two-hour 
lecture can compensate for an 
ineffective junior seminar. 


The History department is taking 
stronger measures. In trying to combat 
overwhelming size of its 
undergraduate population, 
it is 
making the major more stringent. The 
department has already approved a 
motion that would require history 
majors to take 14 credits instead of 12, 
including a two-semester introduction 
to the major and more distributional 
requirements. But even though the 
motion has passed, the program will 
not be implemented until finances 
become available. These changes won't 
affect this year's senior history majors, 
who have to contend with the depart-
ment's flaws. 


Future students of 
medieval England, colonial America, 
and 
modern 
Africa 
will 
face the same problems unless the 
History department rewrites the senior 
essay program.
