**Title: The Free Market and Hispanic America**
**Author: Mario T. Garcia**
**Page number(s): 31**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
World. At the center is the idea that 
the alleged U.S. free market model has 
created and continues to create a 
dynamic and fluid condition which 
makes progress attainable for every 
individual and every ethnic group and 
by extension the rest of the world. 

Discussion 
of class and race are 
anachronistic and are simply excuses 
for the inability or unwillingness of 
some to accept the market place model 
and to conform to the basic principles 
and culture of that model. 

Consequently, if the marketplace is 
the panacea for society's ills then there 
is no necessity for state intervention to 
promote 
particular disadvantaged 
groups. Not only is such intervention 
functionally wrong in that its 
opponents believe it actually restricts 
mobility, but it is patently unfair and 
even un-American in Reagan's 
"colorless America." The free-market 
thesis 
then has justified the 
dismantling or weakening of a variety 
of federal programs aimed at the 
protection of racial minorities, 
programs ranging from· civil rights to 
food stamps to education. Moreover if 
there is failure- if individuals or 
particular ethnic groups do not ascribe 
to the market place model- it is not the 
system's fault, but the individual's or 
group's. 

These views of ethnic America and 
in particular of Hispanic America have 
unfortunately had severe effects on 
Latinos. 

Despite the market-place 
hegemony sustained by the Reagan-
Bush administration during the 1980's 
and its acceptance by a growing 
number of Latinos, this growing ethnic 
groups still faces at the end of the 
1980's serious economic and social 
problems. 

Unemployment, 
under-
employment, an expanding under-
class, 
educational segregation, 
growing hostility to Latino culture as 
exempli fied in "English only" 
movements , 
politic·al 
representation, 
and many other 
roadblocks to socio-economic 
integration remain. 

What was targeted as the "Decade of 
the Hispanic" has instead tumed into 
years of frustration. Yet despite the 
contradictions between an ideology of 
success and the reality of the majority 
of Latinos, it has been difficult to 
counter the Hispanic image of material 
success fostered by the Reagan-Bush 
forces. What is needed to confront this 
contradiction will be for progressive 
forces within the Latino communities to 
mount a counter-hegemonic move-
ment aimed at recapturing the hearts 
and minds of Latinos. Not the least 
significant arena for this confrontation 
will be in the realm of self-identity. 

The ability of self-identification is the 
starting point for recapturing one's 
sense of worth and of destiny. What is 
needed is to replace Hispanic myth 
with Latino reality.
