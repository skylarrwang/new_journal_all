EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
When i was seven years old I used 
to show people where I lived on 
my flat hand. Four fingers pressed 
tightly together as if glued, my thumb 
sticking out at 45 degrees. I’d point to 
the middle of my palm, and declare, 
chin upturned, this is where my mama 
lives. I’d point to my thumb, this is 
where my daddy lives. 

My daddy used to carry my bag for 
me, the pink flowered duffel I carted 
between lives. He lifted it because 
my small hand—the one that carried 
both homes—couldn’t. Daddy would 
load me and the duffel into his 2002 
Saturn. This car is as old as you, princess, 
his voice light and just a little bit mys­
terious. He’d strap me in the front seat, 
a finger against his lips. Our secret. My 
imagined adulthood made me closer 
to him, feet dangling, brushing the top 
of the bag. 

At Mama’s, his hand, not mine, 
carried the bag upstairs. He gave me 
a dazzling grin when he dropped it in 
the center of the room. I watched from 
my window as the red Saturn pulled 
out of the cracked driveway and peeled 
out of sight. 

I tried to lift the bag but it wouldn’t 
budge. I tried lots of different ways. 
Digging in my heels, leveraging my 
weight, I lifted with my knees. I grunted 
and groaned. I gave it a running start. 
I landed with a crash that brought my 
mama upstairs. The bag resisted her 
tanned arms too. She braced her knees 
and yanked. She coaxed. We tried 
together, pushing hard before pulling 
harder, we threw all of our weight at 
the little pink bag, screaming like caged 
animals. We managed about an inch of 
movement before we both collapsed. 
She scooted closer to me, enveloping 
my body with her own, both of us tak­
ing labored breaths. She asked about 
my trip and I thought about the front 
seat. The secret buzzing warmly, locked 
behind my lips.
. . .
The first time I am back in the bed­
room that belonged to a child I am 
twenty. The bag is still here, it sits as it 
always has, preternaturally still, loom­
ing in the center of the unchanged 
room. I wonder how the girl who used 
to live here could breathe. I cannot 
imagine how her small lungs could 
find space to expand with the bag 
filling up the room from floor to wall. 
My father’s sleek Impala rolls up 
the smooth driveway. When I go down 
to greet him after all this time, he 
sighs, impatience mars his otherwise 
unchanged face. I tell him I need a hand 
with my bag, which has only grown 
heavier over the years. What I could 
move perhaps a centimeter the year prior 
now has no give at all. He purses his lips 
but follows me inside. We haven’t spoken 
in a long time but there is a moment of 
mourning when he says that the Saturn 
was scrapped. He’d grown tired of it—
always breaking down. I lead him in, tak­
ing the first left upstairs. He doesn’t seem 
to remember the way. 
I point to it. Sitting there. The same 
place it was dropped thirteen years ago. 
Its weight bulges against the flowered 
seams. The quilted fabric stretching in 
odd shapes, its contents fighting to be 
freed. He doesn’t seem to notice that 
the pink blossomed bag that had once 
rested under my feet in the passenger 
seat would now easily fill the backseat. 
Really? his eyebrows say as he looks from 
me to the floor. This really isn’t some­
thing I can lift myself. I am so needy, so 
incapable, it’s unbearable. He would have 
thought I was raised better than this. I 
hold my breath as he moves towards it, 
grabbing the straps with both of his large 
manicured hands. I barely breathe as it 
lifts off the floor to reveal a flat dark stain 
beneath, one I have never seen before. I 
marvel at it until the weight becomes too 
much, his muscles give out and the bag 
is dropped once more, making no more 
than a thud against the worn carpet. He 
turns to me now and I think he may have 
grown a few inches, or maybe it is just 
that I have shrunk a few. He is just as tall 
as he was when I was seven. 
What on earth do you have in there? 
My throat itches for speech that will 
not come. We stand on opposite ends of 
the bag, the past and the future collapse 
around us. We look at each other, his face 
is mine; it’s like looking into a mirror. ∎
