Dear readers, 
As the future abounds for the new faces on campus this August, the 
Managing Board convened in a slightly more reflective mood. Juniors now, 
we have crossed the halfway mark in our journeys at Yale, and it’s prompted 
us to take a look back.
So too do our writers. Memory is the central theme of this issue of The New 
Journal. How do we mine meaning from the lives of those who have passed––
and when do these stories spin out of control? 
Chloe Budakian tells the story of Margaret Holloway and explores how 
her legacy as York Street’s “Shakespeare Lady” has been flattened and 
narrativized after her death. In his piece on Father Michael McGivney, 
Ethan Wolin chronicles the transatlantic endeavor to make a saint of a 
19th-century American man—a canonization effort spanning the edges of 
the American East, Italy, and the internet.
Throughout the city, people contend with history and tradition. Collegiate 
shooting athletes exercise their privilege to compete amidst a national debate 
over bearing arms; mothers of gun violence victims root trees and flowers 
to memorialize those they have lost. Meanwhile, New Haven’s burgeoning 
biotechnology scene prompts us to ask: can the city learn from its past?
In this first issue of Volume 57 of The New Journal, join us in looking back.
