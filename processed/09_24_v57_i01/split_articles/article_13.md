statue of McGivney to ascend the church steps, and, as one 
Catholic on campus put it, “you’re entering into a different 
world.” The floor is wood-tiled, the ceiling mostly sky-blue. 
Maroon columns rise like clumped-up red licorice.


The building was consecrated in 1874. When 25-year-old 
Michael McGivney arrived three years later, the church was 
gravely in debt. Eight years after that, the bishop handed the 
church to Dominican friars, members of a centuries-old reli­
gious order known for an intellectual style that meshed nat­
urally with the Yale milieu. The Dominicans averted financial 
ruin at St. Mary’s and, beginning in 1907, used a grand house 
erected next door as their priory, a communal home.


More recently, the Knights of Columbus has picked 
up the tab for upgrades at the church. For its 1982 centen­
nial, the organization installed a granite sarcophagus for 
McGivney’s corpse, which was exhumed from a Waterbury 
graveyard. “The Dominicans came in and saved this church,” 
Martin O’Connor, a New Haven deacon and St. Mary’s stal­
wart, said; the Knights, for their part, “have provided extrava­
gantly for the church.”  The two groups made for an unlikely 
symbiosis—between the old and the newer, the cerebral and 
the corporate. All the while, the Dominicans retained the St. 
Mary’s pulpit.


That is, until an ecclesiastical earthquake hit in October 
2021: the archbishop of Hartford announced that New 
Haven’s eight Catholic churches—including a Hispanic one, 
a Polish-speaking one, and a historically Black one—would 
merge to form one parish with shared clergy. The official 
rationale was unremarkable, especially in pandemic-era New 
England: fewer priests spread thin across abundant churches 
communications manager, told me the shift meant “making 
a concerted effort to vocalize that Father McGivney is—he is 
the mission of the Knights of Columbus.”


The celebrations climaxed in October 2020 at the Mass 
marking McGivney’s beatification. The Schachles stopped in 
Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on their drive up to Connecticut, 
where they were quarantined for four days in the Omni New 
Haven Hotel. The main service occurred on Halloween at 
Hartford’s Cathedral of Saint Joseph, with limited atten­
dance. Dan and a veiled Michelle, carrying Mikey, were 
interviewed live from the church plaza by a studio anchor on 
the Eternal Word Television Network.


The week before I left for Tennessee, Dan told me his 
family would not be available to see me. Only once a Knights 
flack arranged our encounter did I first meet six Schachles 
at a Cracker Barrel just off the highway. The restaurant was 
packed and loud at 8 a.m. as we sat down at a round table in 
the corner. Michelle brought an album of images and time­
lines reconstructing Mikey’s medical drama. Besides repeated 
interviews, the Schachles are sometimes treated as small-
time celebrities at a friend’s wedding or an out-of-town Mass. 
“It’s a nuisance, honestly, but it’s a cross that we’re willing to 
bear to help Christ give other people hope,” Dan said.


His discomfort with all the attention, and with my visit, 
ran deeper than the inconvenience. “My biggest struggle has 
been making sure that I am not leveraging the sacred, God’s 
actions, for my financial personal gain,” Dan said. “I don’t 
want the publicity. I want to go about doing my vocation of 
taking care of widows and orphans, and not say, ‘Buy insur­
ance from me because God did this, and I’m great, and all 
that.’ I don’t want to go to hell because of this.”


In 
August 
2022, 
the 
Knights’ 
140th 
Supreme 
Convention—the first in-person one since the pandemic 
began, complete with exultation at the Supreme Court’s 
recent overruling of Roe v. Wade—took place in Nashville. 
“HOME OF MIKEY’S MIRACLE,” read a Warholesque poster. 
Supreme Knight Patrick Kelly saluted the Schachles in his 
main speech, as footage of Mikey at home played on big 
screens for the convention hall. Dan held up 7-year-old 
Mikey. “Thank you for saying ‘yes’ to life,” Kelly proclaimed.


At the Cracker Barrel, Dan explained his caution with 
a parable about a prideful donkey. “They hang the sacred 
images across the donkey’s back for the parade through town,” 
he said. “As the donkey comes by, everyone’s kneeling down 
and praising the images and stuff. And the donkey becomes 
too proud and won’t go into stable. He’s too good of a donkey, 
because everyone worships him, right? So, first of all, I’m just 
a jackass. Whatever’s happened to me is God, not me.”


As the whirlpool of of McGivney’s advance toward saint­
hood revolved around the Schachles, it would also engulf a 
New Haven landmark: the church where McGivney spent 
his seven years in the city. St. Mary’s Church stands on leafy 
Hillhouse Avenue, surrounded by Yale buildings. Pass by the 
Screened poster for the Knights of Columbus Convention.


IV.  THE MOTHER CHURCH



the last Dominican pastor of St. Mary’s, played a key part in 
honoring McGivney’s beatification the year before. “I guess you 
could say that there is some irony in the timing,” he allowed.


The St. Mary’s priory, as it’s still imprecisely known in the 
Dominicans’ absence, now houses the parish offices and several 
priests. The Dominicans’ exit was “not a good chapter in the 
history of this parish,” Deacon O’Connor, a former chief of 
the New Haven Fire Department, said as we sat in the build­
ing’s wood-paneled dining room. “The Dominicans changed 
my life,” he said. “Why would they leave, or be asked to leave, 
when you have a shortage of priests? So that still baffles me. 
They built this house.”


Clergymen, anticipating that a Saint McGivney will 
attract untold pilgrims, said the house may someday be con­
verted into a visitor center with bathrooms and a gift shop.



As he looks out over hillhouse avenue, McGivney’s 
expression is hard to read. His lips seem to form a frown, yet 
his boyish cheeks crease around his nose and mouth as if on 
the cusp of a smile. His shimmery eyes, gazing to the right, 
suggest something like a distant pride. The official portrait—
the chief visual embodiment of McGivney’s afterlife—hangs 
from the church’s gothic stone facade.


If St. Mary’s Church elevates the man’s face, the global 
headquarters of the Knights of Columbus—on the other, 
grayer side of downtown New Haven—further elevates his 
name. It’s the second-tallest building in town, a modern mon­
ument of concrete, brick, and glass with imposing cylindrical 
towers at its four corners. Emblazoned across three floors’ win­
dows are the words “BLESSED MICHAEL McGIVNEY.”


A brutalist building down the block from the Knights’ 
tower, once home to a mix of local agencies and organiza­
tions, now houses the Blessed Michael McGivney Pilgrimage 
Center. In July 2023, the city’s consolidated parish was chris­
tened the Blessed Michael McGivney Parish. Every Sunday 
Mass in New Haven includes a prayer for McGivney’s can­
onization. In short, McGivney has never been more visible 
in his adopted hometown. “From a Catholic perspective,” 
that 
had 
seen 
fuller 
days. 
But 
the move had an 
abrupt 
byproduct. 
St. Mary’s, “due to 
its significance, its 
location,” would be 
“the mother church” 
in the hands of dioc­
esan priests, said 
Father Ryan Lerner, 
who oversees the 
consolidated parish. 
After 135 years there, 
the Dominicans, it 
became clear, would 
have to go.


A Facebook post 
by the friars announc­
ing their departure 
accumulated 
com­
ments from devas­
tated 
churchgoers: 
“Heartbreaking news. 
Blessed Michael McGivney pray for us.” “Executive decisions 
with hazy rationales are not only upsetting, they are also insult­
ing.” One reaction came from farther afield. “So sorry to hear! 
To our St Mary’s family. Blessed McGivney, pray for St. Mary’s,” 
wrote Dan Schachle. The episode remains a sore subject at St. 
Mary’s, where regulars speak in adoring terms about how the 
Dominicans shaped their spirituality.


Adding to the unsavory flavor of what one parishioner 
likened to a “dirty real estate play” by the archdiocese, many 
suspect that McGivney’s beatification less than a year ear­
lier—and his tomb’s heightened power to attract pilgrims—
had piqued the archbishop’s interest in taking more direct 
control of the church. The signs of an ulterior motive stuck 
out to Eire. “This is so ancient. The bishops like to have the 
relics. They like to have a church that attracts pilgrims,” he 
said, adding that, among others who know church history, 
“We all laughed about it when it happened, and cried at the 
same time, because it’s just so typical.”


The archbishop, Leonard Blair, who stepped down in 
May, acknowledged that McGivney’s sarcophagus figured in 
his decision to remove the Dominicans from St. Mary’s. The 
archdiocese offered the Dominicans alternative posts, which 
the friars said they did not have enough time to consider 
before being kicked out. “We have to have a pastoral plan for 
the city that also includes the reality of, I hope, a future saint 
being buried right in the middle of it,” Blair told me over the 
phone. “And so this was not aimed at the Dominicans or any­
thing. It’s just part of a larger thing.”


It will be a future the Dominicans helped usher in. They 
tended to McGivney’s tomb and have long held top religious 
positions at the Knights. One Dominican, O’Donnell, led the 
canonization effort’s initial phase while living in the St. Mary’s 
priory and still leads the McGivney Guild. “It’s easy to take a 
cynical view of it, but I would resist that,” O’Donnell, now 81, 
said of his fellow friars’ expulsion. Father John Paul Walker,

V.  McGIVNEY CITY


O’Donnell wrote in a McGivney Guild newsletter last year, 
“New Haven, Conn., is now officially ‘McGivney City.’”


A few American-born men besides McGivney are 
blessed, too. Among them is Stanley Rother, an Oklahoman 
priest who was martyred during Guatemala’s civil war. It is 
difficult to know whose proponents will attain their final 
certified miracle first. According to McGivney’s great-grand­
nephew, a Bridgeport lawyer, the Vatican has received evi­
dence about a Connecticut woman who recovered from a 
medical emergency with McGivney’s aid. (The Knights did 
not respond to a request for corroboration or more details.) 
Depending on whom you ask, McGivney stands for 
the priesthood (his example redeems a vocation plagued 
by scandal), for baseball (he loved to play), for civic asso­
ciations (the Knights has defied their decline), for nuclear 
families (he supported them through tough times), or for 
American Catholicism’s vitality (his homegrown holiness 
could be its sign and seed). As the Knights’ avatar, he rep­
resents, above all, traditional Catholic manhood, father­
hood, and brotherhood, at a time when the Knights see all 
three under threat. “If more people knew about the virtue 
and the aims of Father McGivney, that could change our 
whole culture,” Dan Schachle said.


Two years after founding the Knights at St. Mary’s, 
McGivney was transferred from the church to one in 
Thomaston, Connecticut. He died six years after that, at age 
38. If he is canonized, the Knights will no doubt savor a spec­
tacle in Rome. Meanwhile, in Dickson’s tight-knit Catholic 
community, the Schachle miracle’s certification garnered 
little attention in 2020, when parishioners were preoccu­
pied with frustration about COVID-19 restrictions. In May, St. 
Christopher’s priest told me the miracle was “old news.”


Not so for the Knights of Columbus: A July 2023 pro­
motional video titled “We are the Knights of Columbus” 
features Dan discussing “Father McGivney’s mission” while 
a clip of Mikey with two of his siblings rolls. And not so 
for New Haven, either. The annual feast day dedicated to 
McGivney comes on August 13, between his birthday of 
August 12 and his death date of August 14. This year, it fea­
tured a special Holy Hour and Mass at St. Mary’s. For almost 
the first time since McGivney’s stint there, regular diocesan 
priests are pastoring at St. Mary’s, hoping their forerun­
ner’s rise will invigorate church life. One of the priests has 
brushed-back brown hair and a youthful face that make 
him unmistakably resemble McGivney.


During a Sunday Mass in April, in the back left 
corner of the church, one woman sojourned at length 
by McGivney’s sarcophagus. Branford resident Victoria 
Pallotto started frequenting St. Mary’s shortly before the 
pandemic, drawn in by the Dominicans. Although their 
departure rankled her, Pallotto has no trouble juggling 
devotion and disapproval. “We’re all humans. We all have 
faults and weaknesses and greeds,” said Pallotto, who pre­
viously consulted as a headhunter for the Knights.


McGivney has become more than a human: a myth, 
and perhaps many things more. To Pallotto, he is part of a 
heavenly world that coexists with ours. The wrinkle where 
the two worlds meet—where divinity becomes tangible—
is a matter of Catholic doctrine: the unity of body and 
soul. Maybe McGivney’s presence can help others, like 
Pallotto, bridge the gap. 


Long after he died, his inheritors have invested 
themselves in him, time and again. From Tennessee to 
Connecticut, and far beyond, they have made his vision 
their own, putting faith in a future he promises from 
above. Their investments are multiplying, past living 
memory of the principal. The greatest reward has yet 
to come. Call it spiritual insurance. The premiums have 
been paid. ∎
