A Theater of Hunger
As Holloway became more comfortable with 
her cohort, her teachers grew intrigued, if not 
charmed by her. “From Holloway’s writing, one 
gets a sense of explosion, spewing forth, release––as 
though she had never expressed herself out loud 
on paper before,” wrote one English teacher. The 
teacher described Holloway’s intuitions about liter­
ature as “unusually mature,” observing that students 
would defer to Holloway before contributing their 
own responses, as if she were their spokesman. 
Though she was shrewd, she was not without 
humor. In Holloway’s progress log, a tutor recounts 
a story Holloway told about a white Albany High 
classmate who called her a slur and demanded 
answers to a math assignment: “Holloway gave her 
all the wrong answers and is enjoying the fact that 
the girl is still taking geometry.”

At the end of the ABC program, its direc­
tor, Dr. Frank Morral, recommended Holloway to 
Northfield Mount Hermon, a boarding school in 
Massachusetts. 
The Northfield Class of 1970 had 198 students. Faces 
from the yearbook suggest that nine of them were Black. 
“I am the only black student in my dorm and it 
can get quite depressing at times,” Holloway wrote in 
a letter to Morral. “It isn’t a very good feeling knowing 
my background when all I hear is talk about ski trips; 
$500.00 coats, (just for classes), vacations in London, 
etc.” One of Holloway’s few Black classmates, Cornell 
Hills, remembered a similar isolation. “You couldn’t be 
Black at Northfield Mount Hermon without hang­
ing out with somebody [from the African American 
society] otherwise you would’ve gone insane. Like you 
were in hell with nobody to talk to.”

Even among other Black students, Holloway 
didn’t fit in completely. Hills remembers her as seri­
ous, intense, and even intimidating. “Back then if 
you wore an afro, you’re immediately identified as 
being somewhat militant,” Hills said.  
Holloway had dark skin, and Hill remembers 
that she was perceived as the most “African” woman 
at Northfield. Hills remembers Holloway had few 
friends, and few romantic prospects. “She might 
have been seen as being too Black,” he said. 
In varying degrees, Holloway lived on the out­
skirts of ABC, Northfield Mount Hermon, and the 
AFRO-AM Society. 

Despite her alienation, Holloway found auton­
omy at Northfield. “A person does not have to live 
up to any reputation, there is almost no outside 
interference, and your parents cannot keep there 
[sic] apron strings choked around your neck,” she 
wrote in a letter to Morral. 
After graduating from Northfield, Holloway 
attended Carleton College for a year as a compar­
ative religion major. There, she acted in student 
productions for the first time and fell in love with 
theater. After her freshman year, Holloway trans­
ferred to Bennington College in southern Vermont, 
where she enrolled as a drama major. 

It was at bennington, a small, private liberal arts 
college, that Holloway’s best friend and dormmate 
Laura Spector first heard the word “trust fund.”

Their friendship was not an obvious match. 
“Looking at us, you would never put two and two 
together,” Spector said. Spector, who is white, was a 
tiny dance major (“5’1 and a half,” she said, empha­
sizing the “half”). And there was Holloway: outspo­
ken, “stunning, six feet, gorgeous” with long, slender 
limbs, piercing eyes, and an afro. Spector remembers 
her laugh well. Her shoulders would shrug, she’d let 
out big, whooping giggles, and her head would bob 
as she covered her mouth. 

Spector and Holloway formed a friend group with 
two other students, including Philemona Williamson, 
now a prolific visual artist. “It was a family, the best 
family I ever had,” Spector reminisced. “I think for 
Margaret, too, it was like a really bonded family.”

At Bennington, privilege was assumed, not dis­
played. Students were artists: they lived in the woods 
with personal studios. Ski coats were replaced with 
big overalls and flowing skirts. When commitment 
to high art was the standard, students were regarded 
more for their talent than their family history. And 
Holloway had talent in spades. 

The qualities that had isolated Holloway—her 
charisma, her physical presence, her wit, her laugh­
ter—bonded her to her new cohort. According to 
three classmates, Holloway was a Bennington star. 
“They viewed her with absolute respect. Absolute awe. 
She was a queen,” Spector said. 

Every year, Bennington students took a non-res­
ident term to pursue their art in the “real world,” 
which often brought them to a second bubble: New 
York City. But Holloway, who lacked the same famil­
ial wealth as her peers, remained at Bennington.

In fact, Holloway was estranged from her par­
ents entirely. Of the thirteen people I spoke to—
close friends, artistic collaborators, acquaintances 
who knew her only as the Shakespeare Lady—all 
mentioned that she talked openly about paren­
tal abuse. Some recounted sharp tensions with her 
father, and many remember Holloway saying she 
had been abused by her mother. 

At Bennington, Holloway had confided to 
Spector that a family member had raped her as a 
child. She was abused. She wanted no contact. To 
Spector’s knowledge, Holloway never returned to 
Albany after she left for Northfield. Holloway stayed 
at Bennington during holidays; for Thanksgiving 
one year, she went to Spector’s house. During the 
summers, she took on odd jobs at Northfield, ABC, 
and Bennington.  

Bennington was her family. The institutions that 
brought her to the North were her home. It was her 
Southern upbringing, however, that informed her 
first original play. 

On a sparsely decorated stage, Holloway stood 
alone, improvising much of the material and in total 
control. Holloway became Jeanette, a Black servant 
to a Southern white woman. Jeanette lamented the 
death of her first lover, who was lynched after “look­
ing wrong” at a white woman. Jeanette gossipped 
with her friends. She went to large parties. She 
attended a Southern Baptist church service. 
Repeatedly, Jeanette’s thoughts flash back to an 
early childhood memory when her mother, bathing 
her, told her what to expect from her life. In a parallel 
vignette, a Haitian voodoo dancer and drummer cast 
bones that prophesied the events of Jeanette’s life.

“The real strength of the play is that Ms. 
Holloway does most of it by herself,” read a review in 
the Bennington Banner. “She could just decide: this 
is it,” Alex Brown, a Bennington classmate, told me. 
“They’re listening. I’m ahead of them. Most actors are 
waiting to see if the audience is there.”

It’s hard not to read Holloway’s life into the 
play. Her life, like Jeanette’s, bore the weight of cir­
cumstance––of poverty, of injustice, of life as a poor 
Black woman in the South. Circumstance, and the 
limitations it imposed, became a kind of predestina­
tion for Jeanette, committing her to a life of poverty 
and discrimination. 

Not so for Holloway. No bones could have fore­
told that she would become a standout in one of the 
country’s most elite drama schools––nor could they 
have foretold what happened afterward. 

In December 2004, the new york times pub­
lished an article about Holloway. It was headlined 
“A Resurgent Downtown Wearies of a Street Poet’s 
Antic Disposition.” 
“Margaret Holloway chose Shakespeare [Hamlet, 
Act I, Scene II], of course, for her first performance 
after serving 53 days in jail for failing to appear in 
court on charges of disorderly conduct, breaching 
the peace and other urban theatrics,” wrote reporter 
William Yardley. 

In the article, Yardley quotes a bartender at a 
local pub. “She just badgers you,” the bartender says. 
“My buddy paid her $50 once to be left alone for a year.”

According to the Times article, Holloway was set 
to appear in court to discuss her use of crack cocaine 
and schizophrenia medication. “But perhaps most 
important,” the article read, “she must convince the 
judge that she has stopped offending merchants and 
passers-by on the gentrifying blocks east of the his­
toric New Haven town green, where expensive new 
condominiums are on sale just steps from her squalid 
third-floor room.”

In the public consciousness, Holloway had all but 
lost her name. To most, she was “The Shakespeare 
Lady”—a figure bearing the mythology that she was 
once a student at Yale. Yet, little is known about what 
happened when Holloway attended the School of 
Drama. When Holloway’s career was finally within 
grasp, circumstance plummeted her life in the oppo­
site direction. 

When describing the culture at the Yale School 
of Drama, Holloway’s classmate and one of the 
School’s first female directing students, repeatedly 
used the phrase “psychological torture.”

“It was like an Agatha Christie novel,” Gordon said. 
The directing students were immediately made aware 
that only some from their original class would make it 
through the School of Drama. “You look at your col­
leagues and go, ‘who’s gonna die?’” 

When Holloway was a student, the School of 
Drama operated on a probationary basis. For their first 
two years, no student’s spot was secure. Each year, fac­
ulty expelled students who did not perform up to par. 
Such was the philosophy of Dean Robert 
Brustein, founder of the renowned Yale Repertory 
Theatre. Brustein—who passed away in 2020—was a 
bold, relentlessly authoritative giant in the American 
theater scene. 

Brustein came to Yale with a pedagogical vision of 
“professionalizing” the school. Students Brustein cham­
pioned would get the opportunity to work with his 
professional actors at the Yale Repertory Theatre. 
It seemed to Gordon that the pressures of the 
School of Drama only strengthened Holloway’s ded­
ication to her training. Gordon remembered her as 
“intense,” “fearless,” and “regal”—impressively in com­
mand of her material. “I think a lot of people in my 
class were afraid of her. I was a little afraid of her too.” 

Brustein had “a few woman favorites,” Gordon 
told me. Holloway was not one of them. Gordon 
remembered how Brustein often overlooked Holloway, 
reserving recognition and opportunity for his favorite 
students—one of whom was Meryl Streep. “I would 
say Holloway was equally a star in the making but had 
to fight harder for everything she got,” Gordon said. 
Brustein had controversial opinions about race: he 
publicly criticized August Wilson, a Black playwright 
who advocated for theater about the Black experience, 
accusing Wilson of promoting separatism. 

In 1972, a group of eight Black School of Drama 
students staged a protest in front of the Yale Repertory 
Theatre, holding signs that read “We Do Exist” and “King 
Brustein is insensitive to black artists.” According to Yale 
Daily News coverage, the protestors expressed frustration 
over “stereotypical casting of blacks as marginal characters, 
and hostile attitudes expressed by the faculty at attempts 
to present elements of the black experience.”

Brustein chose not to comment for the YDN article. 
In many ways, the structure of the School of Drama 
spoke for itself. 

“This is the way he operates, on students’ fear of 
losing their Yale degree,” said one student in a 1975 YDN 
article. “He confuses loyalty with competence,” the stu­
dent continued. “His attitude is, ‘If you don’t like it, get 
out. And if you’ve come this far, what can you do?’”

In the spring of 1975, Robert Lewis, the head 
of the acting department, cast Holloway in a class 
production of “Death Comes to Us All, Mary 
Agnes” by Christopher Durang, a School of Drama 
alum and Brustein favorite. Lewis cast Holloway 
as the maid, a sexual role that required Holloway 
to take off her shirt and seduce two male characters. 
Later in life, Holloway said she felt she was cast as 
the maid because of her race. 

On March 27, 1975, Brustein received a letter from 
Holloway. In it, Holloway described how she had 
approached Lewis with concerns about the “physi­
cal nature” of the play, but he had dismissed her. That 
night, at rehearsal, Holloway says Lewis mocked her 
in front of other cast members by implying that she 
was too fragile to even hear sexually explicit language. 
“Although I didn’t show it, I was absolutely shattered,” 
Holloway wrote. “I could not believe that a man I had 
loved and respected and hung on to his every word for 
all these months had repeatedly insulted my person­
hood that way.” 

Holloway concluded the letter by expressing that 
she had “no place to turn.” “I considered begging out of 
the part, but after Bobby’s response I feared my acting 
classes would be in jeopardy,” she wrote. “I could not 
afford that. I cannot express to you the loss I feel.”  

On the official Yale School of Drama program, 
Dennie Gordon plays “Elizabeth,” the maid. In the 
published play, her name is “Margaret.”
Holloway had enough.

That same year, Holloway left Yale and went back 
to a happier time in her life— Bennington—where she 
pursued a master’s in theater. There, Holloway wrote 
and directed “Facials,” her thesis play. According to a 
review in the Bennington alumni magazine, the play 
examines the life of two women—a prostitute and a 
journalist—as they “wrestle with authority figures and 
sexual domination.” “My image was that both women 
were wallowing in shit,” Holloway said.

The majority of the 35-person cast were non-
drama majors. “I loved working with people who were 
new to the theatre who didn’t walk on stage to prove 
the same point they always had,” Holloway told former 
classmate Brown, now a reporter for the Bennington 
alumni magazine. 

Back at Yale, in 1978, Yale President Bart Giamatti 
did not renew Brustein’s contract. The next year, Lloyd 
Richards took over the School of Drama as its first 
Black Dean. Holloway returned to the Yale School of 
Drama in 1979, this time, as a directing student.
