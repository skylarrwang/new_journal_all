EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
We grew up sitting in the back pew, 
for the most part anyway. Sometimes 
it felt like we shouldn’t, like we were sitting 
the furthest from the message too. Like, 
because we could slip out without anyone 
seeing—the preacher’s family or the old 
people—we weren’t really there. 

I remember the building and the part 
of the service where the pastor brought 
all the kids up to the front for the children’s thing. And the puppet shows. And 
we sang up there, performed for the congregation. And he would make it fun…squeezing toothpaste to show us we can’t 
take our words back. And downstairs in the 
basement there was a hangout place, and 
upstairs the frog room. It was an acronym…
FULLY RELY ON GOD, or something. Only 
the teenagers could go to the basement, 
where there was a foosball table and the 
walls were all covered with murals. I never 
made it down for the big kid stuff. We 
stopped going so much after when I was in 
the frog room and the guy giving the lesson 
told us that everyone divorced was going 
to hell, and so I asked if God understands 
sometimes, you know, if it’s better for the 
kids or the parents or everyone because 
maybe the situation wasn’t healthy and he 
knew my mom got divorced when I was little, but he said no anyway.
She was going to hell too. 
And I didn’t tell my mom because I 
didn’t want her to know. Not that I cried in 
the frog room—I didn’t want her to know 
about hell. So I walked over to the water 
fountain after, and it tasted like iron. ∎
