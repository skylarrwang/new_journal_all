VALLEY STREET AND WEST RIVER 
curl protectively around either 
side of the New Haven Botanical 
Garden of Healing. A group of twen­
ty-five volunteers gather at the entrance 
of the garden, just beyond the reaches of 
West Rock’s shadow.
Marlene Miller-Pratt leads the 
group on a tour. Though small in stature, 
she carries herself with an authority that 
compels her audience to listen closely. 
Her background as an educator shines 
through: until recently, she taught sci­
ence at Hill Regional Career High 
School, but today she has a more somber 
lesson for the volunteers.
“We have become part of a commu­
nity that none of us want to be a part 
of,” she says.
Twenty-six years ago, Miller-Pratt’s 
20-year-old son Gary Kyshon Miller was 
shot and killed in New Haven. In 2021, 
Miller-Pratt led the creation of the United 
States’ first permanent memorial garden 
dedicated to victims of gun violence.
Gary is one of the 676 people memo­
rialized on the walkway of bricks known 
as the Magnitude Pathway. The path­
way unfurls from the garden’s entrance 
toward the plaza, where benches bracket 
a lone elm tree in concentric semicir­
cles. Separated into clusters by a series 
of stone slabs—one for every year since 
1976—each brick bears the name and 
age of a victim of fatal gun violence in 
New Haven. Now spanning more than 
half of the garden’s length, the stretch of 
names inches further each year. 
In the past year alone, twenty-three 
people have died at the hands of gun 
violence in New Haven—an increase 
from sixteen in 2022—averaging one 
fatal shooting every two weeks. 
“And then we forget about it two 
weeks later,” Miller-Pratt says. She 
gestures toward the bricks. “There was 
really a life here. This life was 20 years 
old, that life was 14 years old, and we 
have a problem.”
I.
in 2012, twenty children and six 
adults were fatally shot at the Sandy 
Hook Elementary School, an inci­
dent which marked the deadliest mass 
shooting 
in 
Connecticut’s 
history. 
Since then, Connecticut has tight­
ened its gun control laws. State legis­
lation mandates universal background 
checks and bans assault weapons and 
high-capacity magazines. There has
