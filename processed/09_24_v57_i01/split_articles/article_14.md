My journey from cishet girl to British crew man to non-binary person. 
I
Became a British crew man. Five 
foot two, a woman, American, and I’d 
never rowed in my life. I swaggered 
about campus in a gold chain, spoke in 
a deep voice, affixed a “Yale Crew” decal 
to my computer case, and wielded British 
epithets. My friends expressed con­
cern about this sudden transformation. 
“When you start wanting to be a misogy­
nistic man, there is something to unpack,” 
one of them told me. I had gone from an 
ardent feminist to loudly talking about 
the girls I wanted to “fook.” 

My sophomore fall, the entire heavy­
weight crew team seemed to be in the sci­
ence class for non-science majors called 
Planets and Stars. I stared at the mass of 
muscly men, jostling and play fighting, 
their long legs splayed, their snickers loud. 
They were all tall, all blond, all British or 
at the very least Australian, and all sport­
ing chains. They looked untroubled. “Did 
you do the homework?” “Fook no, mate.” 
I was an anxious, straight, cisgen­
der girl who cared too much. I cared 
too much about school and the state of 
the world and my family and what peo­
ple thought of me. I cared until it hurt 
inside. Singing lullabies and making pea­
nut butter and jelly sandwiches with the 
crust cut off was how I spent my early 
teenage years. I was selfless for my little 
brother, like how my mom was selfless for 
me. Was this destiny for women? To care 
while the men walked off carefree?
In Planets and Stars, I also stared at 
the girls. In particular, a girl with a messy 
mullet who smoked cigarettes and made 
my cheeks tint pink. A friend told me to 
listen to we fell in love in october by girl in 
red. Fall leaves crunched under my boots. 
Smoking cigarettes on the roof, you look so 
pretty and I love this view. I tried to com­
plete problem sets, calculating the distance 
to stars. Looking at the stars, admiring from 
afar, my girl, my girl, my girl.
Transfixed by crew men, I dressed up 
as one for Halloween. Backwards baseball 
cap, athletic shorts, and Kyle’s gold chain. 
I yelled the whole night in a British man’s 
voice. When I sat, I manspread. When I 
walked, I swaggered. When I danced, I 
thrashed. I didn’t care how men saw me, 
euphoric in this new embodiment.
I never took the chain off. I perma­
nently spoke an octave lower. I shelved 
my bell hooks books. I talked about the 
girls I liked as if I was a crew man. “Yuh, 
she’s so hot, mate.” 
It was a bit—except it wasn’t. Did I 
want to be a man? Did I feel like I had to 
be a man to be with women? “Lesbians 
are not women,” my roommate told me 
when I came to her, distressed. She was 
quoting Monique Wittig. Gender is 
oppositional—the identity of women 
is relational to men, and vice versa. As I 
desired women, and wished to be desired 
by women, I no longer perceived the male 
gaze. I flailed about in my womanness, 
unmoored. What I had been told all my 
life made me unattractive to men—being 
assertive, being unfeminine—made me 
attractive to women. My face without 
makeup was not ugly, but handsome. 

It was my junior year, and I had set­
tled into my identity—I dropped the 
British accent and the “Yale Crew” decal 
from my computer. I fell in love with a 
best friend. This was a friend I shared 
everything with. We held hands. We 
gazed at the stars. We read feminist the­
ory together in the library stacks. I told 
her I wanted to raise children with her in 
a commune. She was straight. Until she 
started questioning her sexuality. Then, 
she started dating a man. 

She took me to a bench in the con­
crete courtyard of her apartment com­
plex. “This is where I asked him to be my 
boyfriend,” she said. “I’ll show you how 
it happened. You pretend to be him. I’ll 
be myself.” I sat next to her, legs spread 
slightly, so my knee touched hers. How 
would I sit if I were him? She told me 
how much she liked me. Her features 
blended with the dark. “Then we kissed.” 
Facing each other, our black eyes glim­
mering, we stared in silence. I want to 
be her boyfriend. It came suddenly and 
strongly. I want to be her boyfriend. 

I wore ties and waistcoats. My friend 
said I looked good in them. My room­
mate found me sobbing on my bed. “I 
wish I had a dick,” I choked out. It was 
a biting wish that gnawed within me, a 
desire that throbbed between my legs. 
“Then maybe she’d be with me.” I told 
my friend I liked her, and sent flowers to 
her door. She stayed with her boyfriend—
leaving me with myself.
Personal Essay
“Here comes Dick, he’s wearing a skirt,                                                                                  
here comes Jane, you know she’s    
sporting a chain.” 
– “Androgynous” by The Replacements 


There are pictures of me when I was 
little in corduroy trousers, making sculp­
tures out of rocks, drawing with cray­
ons, running around in the mud. I loved 
princesses, and I loved superheroes. My 
hair was wispy and shorter than my chin. 
There’s another, a few years later, where I’m 
wearing a dress, my legs crossed, my hands 
clasped. I’m sitting below my boy cousin, 
who’s raised above me. My eyes look blank. 
I remember thinking I had to sit pretty. 

In my dorm room, I struggled in 
solitude. My body was ill with anxiety 
and my mind clouded by depression. I 
was peeling away old trauma, unlearning 
self-sacrifice and impossible standards 
for productivity and impulses to caretake. 
Underneath I discovered sexuality—I like 
girls!—and something else. Hidden away 
was a kid in corduroy trousers wanting a 
chance to grow up. I found my self deep 
inside, and it felt—androgynous. 

My haircutter and I usually inces­
santly gossip, but this time we are strictly 
silent. She is concentrated. Chunks fall to 
the floor. When she is finished, we both 
look at me in the mirror. My face relaxes 
into a floppy grin. 

Little things give me joy. A pack of 
Hanes boxers. White undershirts for 
teenage boys. Old Spice body wash with 
an ominous octopus on the front. 

I’m wearing a necktie in a bar, swig­
ging a shot of whiskey and a Budweiser. 
A person comes up to me, and I play 
with her hair. They giggle. He tells me 
I’m pretty. She uses all pronouns—he, 
she, they—but tonight, she says, she feels 
girly. My body presses on hers as we lean 
on the pinball machines. “What are your 
pronouns?” she asks. “I don’t know,” I 
stammer, stupidly. “Well, how do you feel 
tonight?” I look at her, giddy and nervous. 
“They,” I say. 

At a bus stop, there is a grammar 
book stuffed behind the glass, block­
ing the schedule. “How to Speak Good 
English,” it reads at the top of the page. 
“If anybody thinks I’ll stand for that, they 
are wrong,” reads an Incorrect example. 
Anybody is singular, and may refer “either 
to a male or female.” They is plural, and 
refers to neither a male nor female. I dis­
cover I am ungrammatical. 

I like the plurality of they. It’s one 
word so expansive it holds she and he and 
everything in between. And yet, it also 
sheds she and he completely. It’s a pro­
noun of the self—beyond petty, old things 
like grammar books. I realize, I don’t have 
to be a crew man. I can just be myself. 
When I sit, I manspread. When I walk, I 
swagger. When I dance, I thrash. ∎
