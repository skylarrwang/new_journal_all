EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
At 100 and 101 College Street, two 
opposite towers rise into New 
Haven’s skyline. Glimmering tinted 
windows conceal 1,038,000 square feet of 
labs and research space—a hub for the 
city’s burgeoning biotechnology sector. It 
wasn’t always like this.


Seven decades ago, former New Haven 
Mayor Richard Lee described this area, formerly the Oak Street neighbor­
hood and part of the broader Hill 
neighborhood, as a “hard core of 
cancer which had to be removed.” 
To Lee, the neighborhood’s 
poverty was a disease that could 
metastasize and infect other parts 
of the city. He acted swiftly to 
contain it: in 1959, Oak Street 
became the first victim of New 
Haven’s federally funded urban 
renewal plan, which promised to 
bring an old, industrial city into a 
new economic era.


The Oak Street Connector 
was born. A limited access expressway 
designed for high-speed traffic, it aimed to 
extend Route 34 from Interstate 95 through 
New Haven, connecting the suburbs to the 
city. Lee hoped this plan would result in 
long-sought economic development. But 
by the 1970s, funding had dried up, and by 
the 1990s, construction to finish Route 34 
was abandoned. 


Five thousand demolished living 
units, 350 closed businesses, twenty-three 
thousand displaced people, and a mile-
long “Expressway to Nowhere” stood 
testament to Lee’s first-line therapy. His 
supposed cure for “cancer” had severed the 
Hill neighborhood from downtown New 
Haven, accelerating the Hill’s decline.


Five decades later, the city again set 
its sights on Oak Street, this time under 
Mayor John DeStefano Jr. In 2010, the 
City won a $16 million federal grant for 
the Downtown Crossing Project. It would 
transform the Oak Street Connector from 
a limited access highway into an “urban 
boulevard” with sidewalks and businesses. 
The goal of the DCP was to reconnect the 
two parts of downtown that the highway 
had separated for 60 years. The grant was 
a significant contribution for a city with a 
budget of around $475 million at the time.


DeStefano assembled a team of pro­
fessionals and city adminis­
trators to brainstorm ideas for 
redeveloping the highway to 
create long-term economic value. 
The center of that redevelopment, 
they decided, would be the bud­
ding biotech industry. Fueled 
largely by innovation from Yale 
researchers, biotech leverages 
biological research to create new 
medical treatments and technologies—
breakthroughs that the city hoped would 
erupt here in New Haven.


Amid the City’s efforts to fix Lee’s 
urban renewal “cure for cancer,” the literal 
fight against human cancer and disease 
has become remarkably significant.


“The synergy between the growth 
of the [biotech] industry and the desire 
to remove the highway came together 
at just the right time,” said Michael 
Piscitelli, New Haven’s current Economic 
Development Administrator.


The city and Yale envision an eco­
nomic renewal centered around bio­
tech. But New Haven and Yale have a 
history of letting big-picture economic 
development blot out residents’ needs, as 
the failures of their 1960s urban renewal 
effort demonstrate.


The question of who will benefit from 
the city’s investment in biotech remains 
fraught. Jobs in biotech are often inacces­
sible to people without advanced degrees. 
And as expensive real estate for these firms 
reshapes New Haven’s skyline, some res­
idents are left wondering if the city has 
pushed their need for affordable housing 
to the side.  


In 2013, after years of planning, 
DeStefano initiated the demolition of the 
54-year-old Oak Street Connector. “What 
was once a symbol of lost opportunity will 
again become a thriving part of our com­
munity,” he said at the time. 


The question remains: as New Haven 
expands into a new era of urban develop­
ment—largely focused on bolstering bio­
tech—will the city repeat past mistakes of 
ignoring residents’ needs? 


New Haven’s recent surge in bio­
tech traces back to 1992, when Alexion 
Pharmaceuticals, founded by Yale 
professor Leonard Bell, became the 
city’s first major success in the indus­
try. In 2007, the company launched a 
blockbuster immunosuppressive drug, 
Soliris. Fourteen years later, Alexion 
was acquired by AstraZeneca. The 
company now occupies 100 and 101 
College Street. 


“[Alexion] set the standard for the 
ability of our community to mature a 
biotech company,” Piscitelli said.


When DeStefano first stepped into 
office in 1994, he began to develop a part­
nership with then-Yale president Richard 
Levin, turning to the biotech industry as 
a potential remedy for the city’s declining 
economy. Ideally, the partnership would 
be mutually beneficial: the University 
would translate its research into Yale-
licensed technologies, while New Haven’s 
economy would benefit from housing a 
growing, lucrative industry. 


This new focus on technology transfer 
was formalized in 1995, when Yale tripled 
the budget of the Office of Cooperative 
Research—an entity created to translate 
research from Yale into products—and 
hired a former Pfizer executive to serve as 
its director. The OCR began to work closely 
with faculty whose research had potential 
commercial value to find investors. By 
2000, 13 biotechnology companies had 
sprung up in New Haven.


The investment in biotechnology 
began to physically change the city’s urban 
landscape. Yale hired developer Carter 
Winstanley to create private sector lab 
space for companies near the univer­
sity. In 2000, Winstanley developed a 
nine-story biomedical research build­
ing at 300 George Street. By 2005, the 
space was fully leased to Yale, Yale 
New Haven Hospital, and a variety of 
biotechnology companies.


Through the recession of the late 
2000s, Yale and New Haven’s new bio­
tech machine continued to churn out new 
companies as the university helped its 
researchers monetize their work by invest­
ing in them and connecting them with 
venture capitalists. In 2009 alone, Yale 
churned out 5 new startups, and by 2010, 
the number of biotech companies in New 
Haven rose to around fifty. Developers 
raced to keep up with demand for labo­
ratory space, and office occupancy rates 
rose. By then, Winstanley owned over 
one million square feet of commercial 
space between projects at Science Park 
and 300 George Street—but this still 
wasn’t enough space to support the rapid 
pace of new lab-space-dependent biotech 
research flying out from Yale. 


“The pattern of history is always on 
our mind,” Piscitelli said. “The city paid a 
heavy price for urban renewal. We want to 
make sure we learned from that experience, 
that new development speaks to the future.”


still, the irony of the city’s plan—
fixing one urban renewal failure with 
another—isn’t lost on New Haven resi­
dents, as the comments sections of New 
Haven Independent articles about the 
Downtown Crossing Project and the 
city’s investment in biotech suggest.


“The city should have a plan in place 
for a developer to build a 40-story apart­
ment building on the future site that would 
be across from 101 College…where people 
can mostly live, but also work and play,” 
writes commenter @_quinnchionn_.


“New Haven has spent millions on in 
the past decade, correcting the work by 
the cities ‘Best and the Brightest’ urban 
designers of yore,” writes @George Polk.


“New Haven is two cities, and I fear 
the growth of the industry will exacer­
bate the divide between them. I trust that 
most of the folks working in biotech are 
fine individuals. But I suspect few under­
stand what it is like to live paycheck to 
paycheck (I don’t.) And they will be able 
to afford the rents in the new develop­
ments. Few New Haveners can,” writes  
@Kevin McCarthy.


Anstress Farwell, president of the 
New Haven Urban Design League, an 
independent nonprofit voice on plan­
ning and development issues, is also 
wary. When the plans for the Downtown 
Crossing Project came out in 2012, 
Farwell and the New Haven Urban 
Design League released a thirty-page 
report on its flaws, arguing that the plan 
does not actually serve its purpose of 
connecting the Hill to downtown New 
Haven. Further, Farwell worries that 
the plan prioritizes cars over pedestri­
ans. Farwell told me that some of the 
designs in the final plan had changed 
from the original vision that won the 
federal grant—changes, she said, that 
reflected the city’s tendency to align with 
Winstanley’s interests. 


“[Winstanley] is a facility planner, not 
an urbanist,” Farwell said. “He’s focused 
on operations, not on infrastructure and 
creating systems that need to be at certain 
standards.” She worries that Winstanley’s 
emphasis on parking space over side­
walks will result in “dead economic space,” 
as a parking garage employs hundreds 
less than an inhabited business and 
would pay less in taxes. While such park­
ing space would accommodate suburban 
commuters and make new development 
more immediately profitable, Farwell 
argues that it would do little for the 
Downtown Crossing’s goal of reconnect­
ing Oak Street. 


Farwell showed me two maps that 
hung in her office: one of off-street park­
ing in New Haven in 1951 and another of 
parking in 2008. The difference is stark: on 
the second map, the red spots indicating 
parking take up almost half of the page. 


Over email, Winstanley wrote that 
he agreed with the goal of minimizing 
parking, saying that 101 College Street. 
used a parking garage shared by several 
different buildings, and that the building 
had 86 percent less onsite parking than 
100 College Street. “While not perfect, it 
seems like a significant step in the right 
direction,” Winstanley wrote. 


Keeping a parking garage out of 101 
College Street made room for a public 
plaza, allowing people from the neigh­
borhood to “walk right out into the 
space,” Piscitelli said. It aligned with 
the city’s goal to create what he called a 
“more vibrant street life.” 


Flawed or not, the Downtown 
Crossing Project and the construction 
of the College Street towers have likely 
solidified what city historian Michael 
Morand described as New Haven’s new 
“eds and meds” economy for the future. 


While Morand is skeptical that a bio­
tech surge will match the employment 
levels of New Haven’s old manufacturing 
giants such as the Winchester Repeating 
Arms Company, he is optimistic that the 
industry could provide an important base 
for the city’s economic development. 


“The economy used to rely on man­
ufacturing guns and weapons of war,” 
Morand said. “The new focus is on 
human health. A good transition!”


employment in New Haven’s old 
weapons manufacturing industry gener­
ally did not require an advanced educa­
tion, allowing all, regardless of education 
level or origin, to access jobs in the 19th 
and early 20th century. Meanwhile, 90 
percent of biotech jobs require at least 
a bachelor’s degree, according to Peter 
Dimoulas, grant program administra­
tor for Southern Connecticut State 
University.


“That means that for the growth to 
benefit residents, there needs to be a 
strong commitment to investment in edu­
cation and job training,” Morand said. 


In response, the city has created 
several initiatives aimed at preparing 
New Haven Public School students for 
careers in biotech.


The first of these initiatives was 
BioPath, a nonprofit partnership between 
the city and SCSU. In 2015, the city and 
the university signed a memorandum of 
understanding to support career advance­
ment in the biosciences.


BioPath has developed events such 
as the New Haven Science Fair and 
other programs to help teachers under­
stand what a career in biotech looks like 
and incorporate it into their lesson plans. 
Funding for BioPath has come from 
industry partners like Alexion. The goal is 
to create pipelines for students from New 
Haven Public Schools to jobs in biotech.


“We need to make sure that we’re not 
selling them a pipe dream,” Dimoulas said.


During 101 College Street’s develop­
ment, Winstanley decided to place a class­
room in the center of the building, which 
has become an integral part of BioPath’s 
BioCity program. The program selects a 
cohort of high school juniors from four 
New Haven public schools for a biotech 
career training series.


“The program’s goal is to get real life 
exposure to what science is really like,” said 
Robert McCain, science supervisor for 
New Haven Public Schools. “Hopefully 
[students] go into biosciences as their 
major, and give back to New Haven by 
getting a job here, because there’s so many 
bioscience openings.” 


McCain hopes to expand the program, 
but its grant funding—$1.5 million from 
the American Rescue Plan and $1.5 mil­
lion from the Department of Education—
will run out in three years. He’s looking for 
different ways to find the money needed 
to continue the program, but he knows it 
will be a challenge. 


“When we started researching, we 
were trying to model ourselves after 
someone who’d already done this, but 
we couldn’t find any places that have 
done anything like this in a large urban 
city,” he said. 


Since 2021, BioPath has secured 
over 150 job and internship placements. 
BioCity hopes to reach 75 students over 
the next three years. BioLaunch, another 
similar program headed by Craig Crews, 
a Yale professor and the founder of bio­
tech company Arvinas, has cohorts of 
30 individuals each academic year. The 
numbers are not huge, but they’re a 
“proof of concept” that needs to be estab­
lished; then, hopefully, they will scale up, 
Piscitelli told me.


Katherine Perez, an alumni of Wilbur 
Cross High School and SCSU, told me 
how SCSU’s guidance in helping place her 
in a biotech internship with Medtronic 
“opened [her] eyes to see what’s out there.” 
After completing a master’s degree in 
physics, she returned to Wilbur Cross, 
where she had just finished her fifth year 
teaching an early college credit class to 
help high school students get a head start 
on their careers.


Melanie Burgos, who grew up in 
New Haven and also attended SCSU, 
told me that her BioPath mentorship 
helped place her in an internship and 
inspired her to found the “Latinx in 
STEM” club at the university. 


“The truth is, you need the experience, 
the research, all these things to succeed all 
while managing college. It’s so difficult, 
and [Dimoulas’ team] allowed us to find 
those opportunities. In my wildest dreams, 
I never would have thought I would have 
the opportunity to actually do research in 
a lab,” Burgos said.


She served as a panelist for the 
first two years of BioPath’s Connecting 
Students and Professionals of Color 
events—events that she said have 
allowed her to connect with industry 
professionals like Alexion, Boehringer 
Ingelheim, and Pfizer. 


As the city works with Yale and the 
biotech industry to mend their historical 
failures and move past their old industrial 
economy, they will need to replicate success 
stories like Perez and Burgos’. A successful 
new biotech economy will bring money 
back into the city, but could also raise the 
rent for those living in New Haven when 
affordable housing is already scarce. 


The city has plans to continue housing 
development in places such as Pierpoint 
and Church Street South and insists that 
their focus on developing on parking lots 
and vacant land reduces the displacement 
of residents from their homes. But renters 
still confront rising rents, and locals may 
find themselves excluded from the biotech 
job market in the city’s search for a cure.


“A rising tide lifts all ships.” said 
Dimoulas. “But the question that remains 
is: are the opportunities in New Haven 
also for New Haven? Can the average 
student from New Haven, Hamden, 
West Haven—can they gain meaningful 
employment among these companies?”


On most days, people in suits stream 
in and out of the College Street buildings. 
Dimoulas wonders if, in a decade, students 
from New Haven public schools—per­
haps from the Hill—may find themselves 
among them. ∎
