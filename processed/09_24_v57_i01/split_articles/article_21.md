were built on a small offshoot of the 
property where the gunmen’s clubhouse 
sits, a cozy space with a taxidermied 
moose head on the interior wall. 

In 1984, Ed handed off the reins of 
the skeet and trap team to his son, Tom, 
who now runs all of Yale’s club athletics 
programs. Tom quite literally wrote the 
book on skeet and trap. His instruc­
tional manual, “The Complete Book of 
Shotgunning Games”, sells on Amazon 
for $19.95. The Migdalski name is all but 
synonymous with skeet and trap—and 
with Yale club sports at large. 

When asked about succeeding Ed 
as Yale’s coach, Tom responded: “Any 
collegiate club team of any sport needs 
engaged leadership that spans year to year 
for continuity and success.” He believed 
this was especially true for a sport as 
“logistically complicated” as skeet and trap. 
“We were simply lucky that I followed my 
father in this role,” he added. 

At Yale’s 2023 extracurricular bazaar, 
the skeet and trap table was set up in full 
glory. A tri-fold poster featured photos 
of the team’s 13 members hanging out 
at their clubhouse in East Lyme, CT—
making finger guns, high-fiving the 
camera with red plastic cartridge cases 
on their fingers, and walking back from 
a long day of shooting with their rifles 
slung over their shoulders. 

“It’s like my therapy every week,” said 
Linton Roberts ’24, a 2023-24 co-captain 
of Yale Club Skeet & Trap hailing from 
Gadsden, Alabama. “You just let it go for 
an entire afternoon.”

Roberts joined the team in the fall 
of 2019, at the beginning of his fresh­
man year. Like many, he’d found the 
between Americans with a variety of 
attitudes and experiences towards guns. 
“Advocates of gun control have to do a 
little more listening,” he said. 

The gun lobby, however, was not 
impressed with the President’s attempt 
at listening. 

“In his effort to pursue a political 
agenda, he apparently is willing to con­
vince gun owners that he’s one of us,” 
NRA lobbyist Chris Cox told The New 
York Times in response to the image. 
“Skeet shooting…doesn’t make you a 
defender of the Second Amendment.”  

The inaugural yale shooting com­
petition was against Harvard in 1888. 
Yale won. Newspaper records suggest 
that they continued to dominate for 
years after. 

Today, the team is small but mighty. 
It is the only active Ivy League shoot­
ing team, and one of few teams in the 
Northeast to have been continuously 
active for over a century. At many 
schools, teams have dwindled or gone 
extinct. The Harvard Shooting Club has 
been repeatedly abandoned and revived. 
Presently, it does not exist. 

Much of the Yale team’s fortitude 
can be traced back to Ed Migdalski, the 
father of the team’s current coach, Tom 
Migdalski. Ed was the skeet and trap 
coach in the 1960s when he began rais­
ing funds to establish the Yale Outdoor 
Education Center, which emphasized the 
sports of fishing, hiking, and clay shooting. 
The University footed part of the bill 
to establish the Center, and donors paid 
the remainder. The skeet and trap fields 
early weeks of college challenging and 
was suffering from homesickness. “To be 
frank, there were only six kids that came 
up here from Alabama, and I didn’t know 
any of them,” he said. “I was looking for 
stuff that I was familiar with.” 

Roberts had never shot skeet or trap 
before, but he’d grown up hunting with 
his family and had his own shotgun—
which he’d left behind in the move to 
New Haven. 

“To my surprise, Yale had this team,” 
said Roberts. “I was just like, ‘Oh my 
gosh, sign me up.’” 

Roberts began attending weekly 
practices at the team’s private off-cam­
pus facility. He looked forward to 
regional competitions at nearby military 
academies, the annual trip to college 
nationals in Texas, and the chance to 
enjoy some leisurely time far from the 
bustle of the city. 

The team prides itself on having 
a diverse range of student members. 
Athletes do all sorts of things when 
they’re not shooting—they are engineers, 
comedians, frat brothers, and musicians. 
Demographically, however, the team 
is more homogenous. In the 2023-24 
school year, all 13 members were white. 
Only 4 were female. 

These numbers do align fairly well 
with national trends in gun use and 
ownership, according to Pew. 49 per­
cent of white Americans have a gun in 
their household, as opposed to 34 per­
cent of Black Americans, 28 percent of 
Hispanic Americans, and 18 percent of 
Asian Americans. 

As for gender, 40 percent of men 
personally own a gun, and only 25 per­
cent of women do. 

Anna Oehlerking ’25 came to Yale 
fully aware of the existence of Yale’s skeet 
and trap team; it stood out among its 
Northeastern competitors for its longev­
ity and size. “It was why I chose to come 
here,” she said. “Well, that and they had 
an environmental engineering major.”

Oehlerking grew up in a neighbor­
hood where “everybody had a gun safe 
in their basement” and had competed 
on her high school skeet and trap team 
in Minnesota (a major shooting sports 
hub) prior to coming to Yale. Having a 
“tie back home” through shooting sports 
helps her “stay grounded,” she said. 

When Oehlerking joined the team 
in August, she brought her gun in tow. 
Several members of Yale Club Skeet 
& Trap shoot with their own firearms, 
though both driving with and shipping a 
firearm are bureaucratic headaches. 

Boosters of shotgun sports (espe­
cially male ones) often comment on the 
fact that events like skeet and trap offer a 
rare opportunity for women to compete 
on equal ground with men, even if fewer 
women participate. 

“There are girls on the team that 
weigh probably half as much as me, 
and they can outshoot me any day of 
the week,” Roberts said. “That stings a 
little bit.”

These repeated assertions of gender 
parity seem to respond to an unspoken 
association between guns and mascu­
linity. Empirically, more men own guns 
than women, and among people who 
do own guns, men are more likely to 
carry them, and to own more than one. 
Popular iconography is replete with 
images of men with firearms—G.I. Joes 
and their machine guns, cowboys with 
pistols in their holsters, school shoot­
ers-to-be ordering bump stocks online. 

Oehlerking, 
meanwhile, 
is 
a 
self-proclaimed “very liberal Democrat,” 
a vegetarian, and a pacifist. As a girl who 
shoots for sport, she wishes she could 
shed the association between rifles and 
senseless violence. 

“People associate recreational shot­
gun shooting with a lot of negative 
things,” she said. “All that stuff is terrible, 
[but] I don’t think it really has anything 
to do with the sport.” 

Skeet and trap are also expensive. 
With each marksman using 100 
shells per practice, which costs around 
$40 per person, the estimated annual cost 
of ammunition for a single practice with 
everyone in attendance is $520. If the 
team has 10 practices in a semester, the 
cost soars past $5,000. Then, there’s the 
price of transportation, food, and team 
gear, and the maintenance of the guns 
and the clubhouse where they’re stored. 

Some of that money comes from 
member dues, numbering several hun­
dred dollars per semester. Additional 
funding comes from the Yale club sports 
budget, though likely not enough to sus­
tain the team. Donations to the team are 
an integral part of its financing. Some 
of these come from alumni, who receive 
solicitations from the team several times 
a year. But the forces keeping Yale Club 
Skeet & Trap alive extend further than 
the Yale network.

National advocacy organizations 
and 
philanthropic 
groups 
funnel 
millions of dollars into high school and 
college clay teams each year. Some of 
these organizations are directly con­
nected to the gun lobby—legislative 
groups committed to blocking bills for 
universal background checks and the 
limiting of AR-15 purchases. 

In 2009, the National Shooting 
Sports Foundation, a “firearm indus­
try trade association,” launched its 
Collegiate Sporting Initiative to expand 
recreational and competitive target 
shooting across the country.
 The NSSF—run by Stephen Sanetti, 
who is the former chief executive of gun 
manufacturer Sturm, Ruger & Co.—
also runs the nation’s largest gun show, 
the SHOT expo, and lobbies against gun 
control legislation.

The NSSF has sent at least $20,000 of 
grant money to Yale’s team. Yale banned 
donations from the NSSF in 2013, as part 
of a broader ban on accepting money 
from business lobbying groups in order 
to eliminate laborious vetting processes.

Yet, Yale continues to receive money 
from the MidwayUSA Foundation. 

A 501(c)(3) with $273 million in assets, 
the MidwayUSA Foundation is run by the 
Potterfield family—whose fortune comes 
from running a private company that sells 
guns and related gear online. The foun­
dation helps skeet and trap teams raise 
money by providing a digital platform and 
organizing free fundraising events. When 
a team supported by the MidwayUSA 
Foundation raises money, it goes into an 
endowment account. Larry and Brenda 
Potterfield match it dollar-for-dollar. 

“We help those who help themselves,” 
said Jay McClatchey, a representative 
from MidwayUSA. 

The 
difference 
between 
the 
MidwayUSA Foundation and NSSF is 
that MidwayUSA’s sole organizational 
focus is shooting sports. A search for
Yale in the foundation’s “find-a-team” 
directory turns up an endowment listing 
for The Yale University Shotgun Club, 
managed by Tom Migdalski. According 
to the site, Yale’s team has an endow­
ment balance of over $168,000—17 per­
cent of its listed goal of $1 million. 

“We don’t advocate either way, from 
a political perspective,” McClatchey 
said of MidwayUSA. But this statement 
is only true in the strict domain of the 
MidwayUSA Foundation. 

Privately, 
Potterfields 
are 
major supporters of the National Rifle 
Association—the nation’s largest pro-
gun lobby, whose legislative arm stands 
in wholesale opposition to checks on gun 
ownership and use. Brenda Potterfield 
was a board member for decades, and 
in January of 2024, the Potterfields were 
named by a consortium of NRA-run 
shooting and hunting publications as the 
inaugural recipients of the 2024 Golden 
America’s 1st Freedom Award. 

Potterfields’ 
firearm-sell­
ing company, MidwayUSA, is an 
explicit supporter of the National Rifle 
Association as well. “No company in 
America is more dedicated to and more 
supportive of the goals of the National 
Rifle Association than MidwayUSA,” 
says the firm’s website, which also offers 
an NRA donation round-up program for 
online purchases. 

like all sports, riflery is satisfy­
ing. “I remember the first time I shot a 
perfect 25-straight targets,” said Robert 
Person, GRD ’11, a team alum and former 
assistant coach who now runs the skeet 
and trap team at West Point. “It’s an 
awesome feeling.” 

Of all the sports that deliver this 
rush of pride, skeet and trap are actu­
ally among the less dangerous. Football, 
rugby, and MMA produce far more 
injuries. Most sports, in fact, involve 
a choreography that either simulates 
or enacts violence—thwacking and 
tackling, hurling and hitting. In many 
sports, an attempt to score a point is 
called “shooting.” 

But skeet and trap is not like other 
Yale sports. A basketball team does 
not burn through $520 worth of bas­
ketballs in a single practice. A lacrosse 
team does not keep its sticks in an off­
site safe. A swim team does not need 
to decide if it will accept money from 
lobbying organizations. 

Skeet and trap is among the safer 
sports, and yet, holding a shotgun feels 
nothing like holding, say, a baseball bat. 
A shotgun is twice as heavy, freighting 
its carrier with a sense of responsibility. 
Everything must be done right—the 
opening and closing of the safety, the 
angle at which the gun is loaded and 
unloaded. The kickback bounces through 
the shooter’s entire body. The sound is 
loud enough to require headphones. 

In another context, or even fired 
in another direction, a gun has a lethal 
power no baseball bat will ever have. 

“Let’s face it,” said McClatchey. 
“Shooting is a political hot potato. A 
lot of institutions, especially colle­
giate ones, have divested themselves of 
shooting teams.” 

It’s easy to imagine that Yale might 
follow suit.

And as long as gun lobbying orga­
nizations powered by the likes of the 
Potterfields are funding shotgun sports, 
keeping guns in skeet and trap fields 
may also mean benefiting from the  
effort to keep guns everywhere.

For members of Yale’s team, this 
broader backdrop is difficult to escape. 
When Oehlerking tells Yale classmates 
about her passion for shooting sports, 
“they’re taken aback.” In her early days 
at Yale, these negative responses thrust 
her into a “moral dilemma,” she shared. 
She resolved this personally by 
viewing skeet and trap as existing on its 
own little island—the remote idyll of 
the East Lyme Clubhouse. 

“It’s locked away,” she said. “And 
I’m glad for that.”  ∎
