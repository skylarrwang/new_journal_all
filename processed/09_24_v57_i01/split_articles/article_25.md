and their parents’ eyes would light up in 
recognition—I know his sister. I went to 
high school with her.

“It’s almost like a tree,” Foley says. 
“Someone along the way knows somebody who’s been affected, which is really 
hard to think about.”

By gathering all names into a single place, the garden presents individual shootings as interconnected under 
a larger epidemic of violence. It makes 
room for victims of day-to-day gun 
violence in the conversation that often 
leaves them out, demanding that they, 
too, are not forgotten.
not been another mass shooting in the 
state since Sandy Hook. But legislative 
changes have failed to address individual incidents of gun violence.

These day-to-day shootings, which 
frequently involve non-assault weapons, 
fall disproportionately on poorer, predominantly Black communities. One 
study published in 2022 found that the 
rate of death by firearm homicide is 22.5 
times higher for Black men than other 
Americans. Recent profiles of New 
Haven communities suggest that lower-income neighborhoods experience 
higher rates of gun violence.

A gun goes off; a community splinters.

“Those guns need to be turned 
in,” Miller-Pratt says. “But they’re not, 
because [their owners] are scared someone else might have the gun—not realizing that if they use the gun, they cause 
havoc for another family.”

After losing her cousin to gun violence in 2019, Hannah Foley ’24 first 
became involved with the garden as a 
leader for FOCUS, Yale’s community service program for rising first-years, and as 
a supervisor for a green skills internship 
program with Common Ground High 
School. While searching for victims’ next 
of kin, Foley was surprised by the number 
of leads her group would find through 
word-of-mouth. Students would mention victims’ names at the dinner table,

TYPICAL SITES FOR REMEMBERING the 
dead, such as cemeteries or war memorials, are static. Inscriptions on a headstone. A lone statue in the park.

Gardens, however, pulse with life. 
When Miller-Pratt moved back to New 
Haven in 2015, nearly 20 years after her 
son had been killed in North Carolina, 
she discovered Yale’s Marsh Botanical 
Garden. The life that thrived in this 
space—fish rippling through ponds, 
flowers swaying in the breeze—created 
a sanctuary for healing.

“That’s all I want to see,” she says. 
“The life that’s there.”

In 2018, Miller-Pratt attended a 
Survivors of Homicide support group 
meeting and discussed the idea for a 
memorial garden. Her vision resonated with three other mothers who 
had lost their children to gun violence: 
Pamela Jaynez, Celeste Robinson, and 
Winifred Philips-Cue. Through the 
Yale School of Environment’s nonprofit 
Urban Resources Initiative, the four 
women collaborated with the architectural firm Svigals + Partners, which had 
worked to rebuild Sandy Hook four 
years after the shooting.

“From listening to the moms…I 
knew that [the garden] needed to be a 
place that had a progression,” explains 
Julia McFadden, a designer for the garden who had also managed the Sandy 
Hook project. “An experiential type of 
place versus a single monument.”

The Lost Generation sculpture at 
the center of the garden embodies this 
principle. Inspired by Miller-Pratt’s 
belief that “for every life lost to gun 
violence, generations cease to exist,” the 
piece relies on shifting perspectives. A 
faceless aluminum family towers over 
the grass, each member strategically 
placed to create the illusion of alignment as the visitor steps through the 
entrance. As the visitor walks along the 
Magnitude Pathway to the other side 
of the garden, the family fractures.

Visitors who slow down and look 
closely can make out their own silhouettes on the metallic surface.

“I wanted it to be as reflective as 
possible,” says lead architect Marissa 
Mead, who designed the sculpture. “I 
had hoped that people would be able to 
walk up to it and see their faces in it.”

From the other side of the garden, 
the sculpture morphs again. As the visitor looks back from the circular plaza, 
surrounded by greenery and vibrant 
perennials, the family unites once more.

since the GARDEN’s Opening the Urban 
Resources Initiative has held weekly volunteer sessions in the summer to maintain 
the garden. Volunteers emerge from each 
session with arms aching from weeding, 
but leave behind a greenspace dotted with 
new blossoms and fresh mulch.

Miller-Pratt begins each session with 
a tour of the garden. One morning, as she 
leads the group through the Magnitude 
Pathway, a soft voice asks if they can 
pause by the bricks representing the lives 
lost in 1995.

Shantay G., who asked to be identified by her last initial for privacy concerns, steps forward and points to one 
brick. A classmate. She points to another. 
A friend. Her voice does not falter.

“I mean, I can’t even count the people 
I’ve lost alone on my fingers,” she would 
later say. The death of her uncle was particularly difficult: she describes him as a 
dancer and a protector, but keeps the rest 
of his memory to herself.

Though Shantay had spent years 
passing the garden while commuting 
from New York to New Haven, she 
could not muster the strength to enter 
the space alone. Volunteering alongside 
the garden’s founders finally encouraged 
her to step foot into the garden and 
share experiences with other people who 
had also lost loved ones.

“Listening to their stories provides 
a way of healing,” Shantay says. “[The 
victims] are not forgotten because their 
lives meant something too.”

While death prevails in a cemetery—
coffin closed, headstone lodged—the 
lifeline of memory keeps flowing through 
the community that gathers in the garden. They restore what grief eviscerates. 
The corners of Shantay’s eyes crinkle 
up in a smile. “Community involvement. 
That’s what makes us whole.”

the NEW HAVEN GARDEN has inspired 
the creation of other memorial gardens 
across the country. In May 2023, Pamela 
Jaynez and other Hamden residents 
received mayoral approval to construct a 
similar site in Eli Whitney Park. Miller-
Pratt lists off other cities that have built 
gardens of remembrance: Philadelphia, 
Baltimore, and Durham.

Every second Saturday in June, 
soon after the flowers reach full bloom, 
members of the New Haven community gather in the garden for the Annual 
Day of Remembrance. Speakers such 
as Mayor Justin Elicker, State Senator 
Martin Looney, and Police Chief Karl 
Jacobson take turns reading the names of 
every person memorialized in the bricks.

Last year, it took 37 minutes to read 
each name. This year, it takes 40.

At one point, a mother wishes her 
son a happy birthday. He would have 
been 31. She ends her list of names the 
way every speaker does: “Say their names.”

“Say their names,” the crowd repeats.

After the mayor reads the final name, 
community members reach for each 
other. Miller-Pratt sits down and gazes 
at the pathway. Under the shade of the 
trees, she waits for the day the bricks 
stop growing. ∎

The New Journal was founded in 1967, under the following mission statement: “This university has once again reached that stage in 
history when people are talking about the New Yale, presumably to be distinguished from the Old Yale, which in its own day was 
presumably considered new. Wishing to share in this modernity, we have chosen The New Journal as the name for our publication. 
Besides, things seemed slow around here.”

Today, The New Journal is published five times during the academic year by The New Journal at Yale, Inc. One thousand copies of each 
issue are distributed free to members of the Yale and New Haven community. The New Journal is printed by TCI
