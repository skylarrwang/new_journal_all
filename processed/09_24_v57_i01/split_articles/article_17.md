For decades, Margaret Holloway performed 
Shakespeare on the corner of York Street in exchange for 
money. Behind the mythos of “The Shakespeare Lady” 
was a budding actress failed by a series of places and 
people—including at the Yale School of Drama.

f you walked past the steps of the Yale 
School of Drama between the 1980s and the 
early 2000s, you might have encountered a 
woman with wide, forceful eyes. She was thin, 
dressed in threadbare clothing, and often bare­
foot. She would offer recitations of Shakespeare in 
exchange for a few dollars.  
Her performances were intimate and musical—
she stretched her words out as if she were hum­
ming, until each sentence became a tune of its own. 
For her, theater was survival. It gave her an income 
and a means of expression. But she wasn’t always 
able to perform. She had paranoid schizophrenia, 
which came with debilitating hallucinations and 
bouts of aggression; sometimes, she would yell 
frighteningly at her sidewalk audience. To onlook­
ers, she inhabited a gray space between reality and 
fiction. When did the performance stop and the 
person begin? 
Her name was Margaret Holloway—perhaps 
better known as “The Shakespeare Lady.” She grad­
uated from the Yale School of Drama in 1980. After 
graduation, she spent much of her life without sta­
ble housing, reciting Shakespeare to stay afloat.
For decades, observers have spun competing 
interpretations of Holloway’s life. One 2004 New 
York Times article identified her as a “street poet” 
with an “antic disposition.” An obituary, also pub­
lished in The Times after her death in 2020, called 
her “a once-promising director and actor who strug­
gled with mental illness and drug addiction.” Spike 
Lee featured her in his documentary series “​​New 
York Epicenters 9/11-2021½.” Multiple playwrights 
are turning her life into scripts, and Emmy Award-
winning actress Uzo Aduba expressed an interest in 
developing Holloway’s story into a feature film.
Retellings of Holloway’s life have strung 
together sparse and often reductive pieces of infor­
mation. Some stories portray her as the victim of 
a terrible mental illness, but others frame her as a 
proud woman who refused help, culpable for her 
own suffering.
This article is an attempt to tell Holloway’s 
story in its entirety, exploring the talent that pro­
pelled her to Yale, the people who isolated her, and 
the structures that failed her. Through thirteen 
interviews and dozens of documents tracing back 
to her childhood, this piece interrogates what is 
known and unknown about the life and artistry of 
Margaret Holloway—the woman who made York 
Street her stage.

Margaret holloway was born on September 
7, 1951, to Walter Holloway, a preacher, and Bertha 
Holloway, a bus cleaner and homemaker. She was 
raised in Albany, a Black Belt county in Georgia. In 
1961, when Holloway was 10 years old, Black local 
leaders, assisted by Martin Luther King Jr., began 
the first mass desegregation campaign of the civil 
rights movement. In 1964, Albany High School 
desegregated. Four years later, Holloway transferred 
there at the start of her junior year.
Most of her peers would remain in Albany for 
the rest of their lives. Those pursuing higher educa­
tion would likely end up at the local junior college or 
state university. Not Holloway. In the spring of her 
junior year, she applied to A Better Chance (ABC), 
a program that placed high-performing students of 
color in prestigious boarding schools.
When Holloway arrived at ABC’s preparatory 
summer program in 1968, teachers remarked that 
she had “weak writing,” “below satisfactory” vocabu­
lary, and “tremendous gaps” in mathematics. In a log 
of Holloway’s progress, a tutor initially noted her as 
“well-mannered but shy.”
