T
he imperative of skeet and trap 
is simple: shoot at moving objects in 
midair. Hit as many of them as possible. 
At a small red-brown clubhouse in 
East Lyme, CT—45 minutes from New 
Haven—12 Yale students fire away. 
Their targets are clays, 4-inch wide 
orange discs, shot out from an oscillating 
“bunker” machine. When hit, the clays 
fissure in a dramatic transformation from 
solid rounds to shards and dust. Their 
remains descend onto the field like ter­
racotta snow. 

Every shot emits a sonorous pop—
imagine the world’s biggest champagne 
cork coming loose from its bottleneck. 
But the members of Yale’s club skeet 
and trap team are used to this: they do 
it every week. 

With more than 100 years of history, 
a clubhouse of its own, and a committed 
(if small) roster of athletes, the Yale Club 
Skeet & Trap Team is a powerhouse in 
the world of college shotgun sports. Yet, 
few students at Yale even know it exists. 

On a national level, clay target shoot­
ing plays a significant role in conversations 
about firearm use. From some vantage 
points, it represents a middle road in fights 
over gun ownership, demonstrating the 
possibility that guns can fit safely and 
uncontroversially into the fabric of daily 
life. But a broad view of the sport, its fund­
ing, and the culture surrounding it pres­
ents a more complex picture. 

Skeet and trap are separate but simi­
lar events. In skeet, two bunkers fire clays 
which cross somewhat predictably in mid­
air. In trap, a single bunker fires clays at 
random angles, requiring quick reflexes. 
Trap’s existence precedes skeet’s by 
over a century. The first known men­
tion of a trap-like sport is from 1793 in 
Volume 1 of an English periodical called 
Sporting Magazine. In it, an article 
describes the emergence of an activity 
involving placing live pigeons in a small 
box—a “trap”—with a sliding lid. The 
trap was lowered into the ground, and 
on the cue of a shooter, its door was 
drawn open, releasing a bird into the 
line of fire. It was “the most infatuating 
and expensive amusement the juvenile 
sportsman [could] possibly engage in.” 
Clay pigeons replaced live ones when 
the sport crossed the Atlantic in the early 
19th century, and the cruelty-free version 
of the sport became a popular American 
pastime. Americans shoot skeet and trap 
competitively from the middle school 
level to the Olympics. 

In both skeet and trap, guns are 
unloaded with a “break action”—snap­
ping them open at a central hinge to eject 
old cartridges and insert new shells. It’s 
this mechanism that distinguishes them 
from semi-automatic weapons, which 
don’t require intervention to reload. 

The sport has widespread and sur­
prisingly bipartisan appeal, even for 
politicians who push for gun control. 
Throughout his 2024 vice presidential 
bid, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has 
repeatedly boasted about having been 
“the best mark in Congress.” 

In 2013, President Barack Obama 
announced that he’d picked up skeet 
shooting as a hobby during his time at 
Camp David, the presidential retreat. 
Accompanying courtesy photos showed 
POTUS in wraparound sunglasses, his 
cheek flush to the comb of a wood-pan­
eled shotgun. 

This announcement came when 
the former president worked to ban 
assault rifles and high-capacity maga­
zines, as part of an intensified gun con­
trol push following the 2012 murder of 
20students and 6 adults at Sandy Hook 
Elementary School.

President Obama told The New 
Republic that he was speaking pub­
licly about his hobby to bridge gaps 
“Yale Club Skeet & 
Trap is the only active 
Ivy League shooting 
team, and one of 
the few teams in the 
Northeast to have been 
continuously active for 
over a century.”
