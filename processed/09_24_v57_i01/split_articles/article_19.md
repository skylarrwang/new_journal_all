EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
When she returned to the School of Drama in 
1978, Holloway chose the unpublished play “God’s 
Smoke” as her thesis production. The play, written by 
Bennington professor John Gardner, is relentlessly 
dark: set in the 14th century, it follows an abbott, a 
monk, a countess, and her kidnapper menaced by 
plague and hallucinating the presence of Death per­
sonified. That plague, Holloway comments in her final 
essay, parallels modern-day “disease and mental illness 
and violence” which are “at plague proportions.” 
Through the play, Holloway sought to showcase 
what she termed the “theater of hunger.” “We all have 
hungers,” Holloway wrote in her final essay: hungers 
for food, shelter, sex, reproduction, freedom, under­
standing, and distinction. Narcissism, too. However, 
she continues, “obstacle” forces, which range from 
natural catastrophes and birth defects to societal prej­
udices, tyranny, and repression, impede satiation. The 
conflict between our hungers and these obstacle forces 
is the subject of Holloway’s theater. 

Holloway placed her theater of hunger in opposition 
to “intellectual theatrics.” “In order to abstract the truth,” 
Holloway writes, “the artists must first know the truth.”
To know the plague, you must also experience 
the plague. 

In playwright and classmate Allan Havis’ mem­
ory, Holloway’s mental health started to deteriorate 
during her last semester at the School of Drama. 
Until this point, none of her friends I talked to, at 
Bennington or at Yale, had noticed signs of mental 
illness. Havis remembers Holloway’s intensifying 
substance use and emerging schizophrenia. 

Havis also noticed that Holloway would experience 
“cycles of paranoia.” She felt that faculty members paid lit­
tle attention to her, and that “she was not going to get the 
benefit of the so-called Yale mafia.” It certainly didn’t help 
that she felt Lloyd Richards was ignoring her. According 
to Havis, when Holloway re-en­
rolled at the School of Drama, she 
felt heartened that she had a Black 
dean, and she expected Richards 
to understand her and support her 
career. As Holloway approached 
graduation, her paranoia became 
more frequent, and she would have 
frightening moments of anger. It 
was unclear exactly what was hap­
pening to Holloway, but it was then 
that Holloway’s classmates could 
tell something was changing.

“Many artists of past and 
present have aspired to some 
notion of a theater of hunger,” 
Holloway wrote in the final para­
graph of her thesis. “Many were 
imprisoned, ostracized, driven 
insane, etc.” Nevertheless, she 
wrote, “these artists know that 
there is no separation between the quest toward a the­
ater of hunger and a quest toward a way of life.”
“We continue in this quest.”


Among holloway’s close friends, how she 
ended up on the streets remained a mystery. One 
man had a sense of how it happened. In the two 
years post-graduation, Richards received numerous 
accounts of Holloway’s increasingly erratic behavior. 
In August of 1981, Holloway, then a Yale graduate, 
sent Richards a letter regarding her interest in teach­
ing at the Yale School of Drama or Repertory Theatre.

Holloway had tried to launch her career. She 
worked with Brustein as an assistant director for a 
production at the American Repertory Theatre, fol­
lowed by a short post at The Everyman Street Theater 
in Washington, D.C. Yet Holloway ended up back 
in New Haven, hosting acting workshops for high 
school students. Richards did not hire her. 

Nine months later, Richards received word of 
Holloway again; this time from a librarian at the 
School of Drama. Holloway had stolen a book. 
Holloway’s behavior had become “markedly irratio­
nal,” the librarian wrote. In one instance, the librarian 
said Holloway scribbled nonsense on a piece of paper 
and pinned it to a bulletin board. 

A day later, Richards received a second notice. 
The librarian had threatened to call campus police on 
Holloway. She recounted that Holloway had left the 
building shouting, “Racism strikes again!”

In Bennington classmate Richard Dailey’s docu­
mentary about her, Holloway recounts being evicted 
from her apartment in 1983.  
Through her next two decades as the Shakespeare 
Lady, a legion of passersby formed a community 
around Holloway. They were struck by her recita­
tions, struck by her conversational wit, struck by the 
fact that, after a brief encounter, she would remember 
their names for years afterward. This circle included 
multiple journalists, a rabbi, local musicians, and a 
lawyer who represented her pro bono. 
“Her 
moments 
of 
lucidity were just aston­
ishing,” Dailey told me. 
“You could understand the 
vestiges of her genius that 
would come flashing out.” 
When Dailey asked 
her to recite, she’d go 
quiet before beginning. 
Something deep inside 
her would seem to shift. 
It was as if the words 
were committed to mem­
ory––committed to soul. 
She’d cut off some words 
quickly, but she’d hold 
others until her voice 
broke. It was rhythmic, 
hypnotic, 
declamatory. 
She did it all in a perfect 
General American accent.

Holloway’s classmates don’t remember her hav­
ing an interest in Shakespeare. Holloway’s street rep­
ertoire was a product of her theater education. She 


recited lines from “Medea,” “Canterbury Tales,” “The 
Tempest,” “Hamlet,” and “Macbeth”—all plays she 
acted in or directed. In one video posted of her act, 
she recites an excerpt from 
“God’s Smoke.” 
“I always took the idea 
that she was probably the 
most famous performer 
in New Haven,” Chris 
Arnott, Holloway’s friend 
and writer for the Hartford 
Courant, told me.

Holloway’s story as the 
Shakespeare Lady, then, 
was ripe for interpretation.
“She was her own 
Greek tragedy,” Gordon 
said. “It’s so poignant that 
she held onto the drama 
school and the Yale neigh­
borhood, 
remembering 
that her best times were 
there when she was her 
best self.” 

Cecelia Rubino, a classmate who acted in 
Holloway’s School of Drama thesis, later included 
Margaret as a character in her documentary, 
“Remembering Shakespeare”. Rubino is less con­
cerned with the spin of the narrative, but the urge to 
turn Holloway’s life into narrative in the first place. 
“I’m just like, how could you film her?” said 
Rubino, “But I had the same thing of like, why am I?”


in 2005, Spector, Holloway’s best friend from 
Bennington, made a trip to New Haven. She hadn’t 
seen Holloway since the 1980s, when Holloway had 
asked her for drug money. By now, Holloway had 
stopped her recitations on York Street and moved 
into state-assisted housing. She seemed healthier—
less frail than she did in the days she was addicted to 
crack cocaine. 

In her apartment, “time stood still.” “It was 
just like a dorm room,” Spector told me. “She had 
Michael Jackson, and she had Motown and all that.” 
When Spector and Holloway ventured out to get 
food, Spector remembers Holloway becoming “par­
anoid” and “internally small,” shrinking back as peo­
ple looked at her. 

In her final years, then cloistered in her 
apartment, Holloway had a regular visitor: Joan 
Channick, the warm but matter-of-fact chair 
of the Theater Management program at Yale 
School of Drama. 

Channick gave Holloway her number a few 
years prior but grew overwhelmed by the number 
of calls she was getting from Holloway. Holloway 
would ask Channick to bring her things or give 
her money. Mostly, though, she just wanted to talk 
about theater. Holloway would tell Channick sto­
ries about praise she received from Brustein and 
productions she directed. “I heard all of her sto­
ries over and over and over again,” Channick 
remembers. “And to be honest, I didn’t know 
what to believe.” 

In the last two years of 
her life, Holloway moved to a 
nursing home. Every month 
Channick would visit. Every 
time, Holloway prepared writ­
ten lists of things she wanted 
to talk about. 

When the pandemic hit, 
Channick and Holloway regu­
larly called each other. 
Then, Holloway stopped 
responding. After two weeks 
and no response, Channick 
began a lengthy back-and-forth 
with Holloway’s conservator; 
because they weren’t family, 
neither Channick nor any of 
Holloway’s other friends could 
know the status of her health. 
On May 30, 2020, at the 
age of 68, Holloway died of COVID-19. Nobody 
but Channick and Holloway’s family members 
knew until news outlets published her obituary.


To channick, Holloway reminds us of the 
“precariousness of anyone’s life.”
But Holloway’s life had been precarious 
from the moment she left Albany. Theater gave 
Holloway a means of interpreting her experiences; 
but elite institutions were interested in her tal­
ent, not her personhood. When Margaret arrived 
on the East Coast, she carried with her a child­
hood wrought with trauma. At every school she 
attended, some aspect of her identity—her race, 
her class––isolated her. 

As artists, friends, and family tell Holloway’s 
story, they decide how she should be remembered. 
Holloway becomes a caricature of the mad art­
ist. Or an inspirational story of an unbreakable 
commitment to art—the embodiment of her own 
theater of hunger. Or she’s just the Shakespeare 
Lady: mentally and physically ill, reciting non­
sense outside of the Yale School of Drama. This 
article, too, tells Holloway’s life through dozens of 
perspectives, but not her own. Holloway, like all of 
us, is a kaleidoscope of stories; she just doesn’t get 
to tell any of them. ∎
