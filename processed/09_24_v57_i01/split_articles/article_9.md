The difference between 
him and his mother 
is God believes in his mother. 
He says he is not his mother 
but he conceives of the dead 
the way his mother does at sixty; 
his dreams glance 
to the rear and flanks 
     (where danger waits) 
and his ear hears: it hurts. 
     “Your father likes this dish. 
     This Sunday is Father’s Day. 
     Why you’re not coming home? 
     Why my four boys 
     are the smartest boys in the world 
     and can’t help me?” 
him and his brothers 
is his brothers believe in his mother.
