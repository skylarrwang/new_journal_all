CoNCERNED CITIZENS TAKE NOTE: The 
New Haven Police Department is cracking 
down on drugs in our city. Thousands of 
New Haven residents have been arrested 
for drug crimes the past several years. In 
1997, 2,061 citizens were arrested; in 1998: 
1,860; in 1999: 1,632; in 2000: 1,547; in 
2002: 1,311. Don't let these decreasing fig-
ures worry you-crime rates in the city 
have been dropping as well. In New 
Haven, 7 to 10 percent of the population 
is estimated to use drugs-putting the 
number of users in New Haven some-
where around 10,000. 
At Yale, however, there is still work to 
be done. Because the school claims that it 
has no idea how many students use drugs, 
the best estimates come from national sur-
veys. The Sourcebook for Criminal Justice 
Statistics found that about 35 percent of 
college students used drugs during 1999, 
2000, and 2001. Assuming Yale meers this 
estimate, approximately 18oo Yale College 
students used drugs over the past year. The 
Yale Police Department has maintained a 
8 
relatively low arrest rate for drug crimes. In 
1999, there were zero arrests for drug 
crimes. In 2000, there were also zero 
arrests. In 2001 there was a crime spree and 
the number of arrests surged to three-.6 
percent of the undergraduate population. 
This means that from 1999 to 2001, for 
every Yale student arrested for a drug crime 
there were approximately 1400 New 
Haveners arrested. To some extent this can 
be explained by the vast population differ-
ence. A better comparison is the number of 
estimated drug users arrested every year. In 
New Haven, 15 percent or so of the total 
estimated users have been arrested. At Yale 
.2 percent of the estimated users were 
arrested--during a good year. 
Â· 
The num~er of disciplinary referrals 
for drug violations didn't make up for this 
disparity. There was one referral by the Yale 
Police Department in 1999; none in 2000 
and one in 2001. Other colleges and uni-
versities in Connecticut had better luck 
when it came to enforcing the law. At 
Eastern Connecticut State University from 
1999 io 2001~ there were 20 arrests and 76 
judicial referrals for drug violations. At 
Fairfield University, there were only seven 
arrests from 1998 to 2000, put there were 
132 disciplinary referrals for drug viola-
tions. At Southern Connecticut State 
University, there were 6o drug violations 
cited from 1999 to 200. All three schools 
are smaller than Yale.
