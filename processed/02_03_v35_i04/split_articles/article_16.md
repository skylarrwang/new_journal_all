EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Pharma "is a pharmaceutical company; we 
make medications to help physicians do 
their jobs better." After 20 years of working 
in addiction therapy, Schnoll knows there 
is a "definite need for better treatment," 
but adds that "is simply not our job." What 
this means is that Purdue Pharma will 
never direcdy fund any treatment pro-
grams. 

Mark Kinzly is proud of his work in 
Maine last summer because "as someone 
who has been on both sides of the street-
both as a research subject and as a 
researcher-it's critically important to me 
that we do good work in the community so 
that they can make changes." Still some-
times he knows he could have done more: 
"Yeah, I wish we had one percent of their 
profits to do really good intervention, like 
treatment programs. I also wish that frogs 
had wings so they wouldn't bump their 
asses when they jump." 

LATE 
IN 
JANUARY, Carrie Perkins-
McDonald got a call from a desperate, 
middle-aged father. His 19-year-old son 
had become addicted to OxyContin over 
a year ago and had robbed his parents to 
support his habit. Now they have been 
forced to file for bankruptcy. Lately, 
McDonald, who works a double shift as 
the co-director of Neighbors Against 
Drug Addiction and the director of the 
Opiate Treatment Planning Grant, in 
Calais, Maine, fields phone calls like this 
at least twice a week. 

Perkins-McDonald spent her entire life 
in Calais, a town whose one cab is the only 
taxi service in all of Washington County. 
One of her best friends from high school 
won a full scholarship to 
Boston University Law 
School, but her addic-
tion to OxyContin pro-
hibited her from attend-
ing. Last time Perkins-
McDonald saw her, she 
weighed 90 pounds and 
had contracted hepatitis 
c from injecting unclean 
drugs. 

Another 
best 
friend's OxyContin habit 
precipitated a miscar-
riage three months into 
her pregnancy. Over the 
last year and half, Carrie 
has tried to supplement 
this anecdotal evidence with hard data illus-
trating the growing public health crisis rav-
aging her hometown. 

People 
in Washington 
County, 
Maine's most rural region, where almost a 
fifth of residents live below the national 
poverty line, have always turned to drugs. 
In a 2002 survey, the Maine Office of 
Substance Abuse interviewed high school 
seniors about their drug habits. While 
Washington County teens, according to 
the data, binge drink as much as their peers 
in the rest of the state, almost twice as 
many use O:xyContin-5.8 percent in 
Washington County versus 3.2 percent 
everywhere else. There are ads in the local 
paper urging people to become foster par-
ents-a dire need in a county where last 
year the number of children removed from 
the homes of addicted parents increased 50 
percent. 

Kicking an opiate habit is almost 
impossible in Calais, however. The nearest 
methadone clinic is three hours away, and 
state and federal agencies have rebuffed 
Perkins-McDonald's efforts to create a clos-
er one. Ironically, Purdue Pharma is the 
only institution that has come to 
Washington County's aid over the last two 
years. They gave Perkins-McDonald $5,000 
last year, which allowed her to rent an 
office space in downtown Calais and print 
prevention pamphlets with the leftover 
money. Last fall, the local-high school ran 
out of money to pay their in-house drug 
counselor. Perkins-McDonald had the city 
council write Purdue Pharma a letter 
lamenting the loss. Within three days, the 
company donated $40,000 to keep a coun-
selor in the school. 

In October 2001, a Purdue Pharma 
representative arrived in Calais claiming to 
have a solution. At a banquet dinner fund-
ed by the company, the representative 
announced a new education plan that 
would keep children from trying drugs. It 
was called "Painfully Obvious." Inside each 
kit was a gelatin model of a human brain. 
A glossy pamphlet inside described the 
gory effects of opiate withdrawal--con-
stant diarrhea, vomiting, and severe shiver-
ing. A few gradations of the obvious later, 
under heading labeled "RidiCulously 
Obvious," the pamphlet let kids know that 
"DEAD PEOPLE ARE NO FUN" 

But the parents of Washington 
County's opiate-dependent teens were 
impatient with anyone offering gimmicky 
prevention tools and simplistic pamphlets 
bearing sober warnings. Their children 
were already beyond their control. As ten-
sions rose, one man stood up and demand-
ed to know why Purdue Pharma could not 
spare a fraction of the millions of dollars in 
profits from OxyContin to give Calais 
what it needed most-a treatment center 
to help those already addicted get clean. In 
reply, the spokesman repeated the company 
line: Purdue Pharma's obligations extend 
only so far. The company only makes 
drugs. While they want to make sure their 
products are properly used, getting addicts 
off drugs is somebody else's business.
