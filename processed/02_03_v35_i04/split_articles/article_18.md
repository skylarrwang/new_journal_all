meaning he will generally only bet on races shorter than seven 
eighths of a mile--but that's only part of the story. "The people 
who win at this-it's a lot of work," he says, nodding at the con-
testants around him. Beef put in six hours yesterday, analyzing the 
races to predict which horse will bring home the money in a com-
plex and very difficult process known as handicapping. 

The basic premise of handicapping is that if you take the time 
to study the horses, to research the sire of the horse, the sire of the 
horse's dam, the number of workouts the horse last run, the post 
position of the horse, the 
horse's doses of the steroid 
lacix, if the jockey is a jour-
neyman or not, if the turf is 
soft or hard, if the blinders 
are on or off-you can con-
trol the races. A retired 
horse-owner who flew up 
from Florida spent an hour 
on the plane and another three at his hotel handicapping. One con-
testant, a meteorologist, has created an entire website to showcase 
his own statistical analysis of the winning probability of every 
breed. The Tournament Maverick spends every day working nine to 
five busily computing an infinite number of variables. 

Handicapping helped wean Beef off the addiction that some-
times likes to curl up in the laps of gamblers. He has created a suc-
cessful career of controlling the races. Now, he says, he can go rwo, 
even three weeks without placing a bet. "Unfortunately, the bad 
apples, the compulsive component of the game, get the spotlight. 
And so business guys like me don't get the spotlight, the ones that 
look a~ it like a business, as opposed to a compulsion." Beef takes a 
sip of his drink. The turquoise stone on his ring glimmers. He is not 
nervous. The first race is starting, and today may be his day to con-
trol the races. The spotlight is where it should be: on the real win-
ners, the people who treat this game as a skill. Not on the bad 
apples, the degenerates who give gambling a bad name. 

Across the room from where Beef is placing his wagers, anoth-
er man has set up camp in his usual spot. A custodian by day, he 
and his buddies have been gambling at Sports Haven for as long as 
any of them can remember. They 
usually come here, to this corner 
of the stadium that overlooks the 
sea of glowing televisions below, 
to bet on the dogs. This is the 
place where a few months back, 
on a late Monday afternoon, he 
and his buddies sac down to cal-
culate their cumulative losses. 
They came up with over $I million. On that afternoon, the custo-
dian admitted that he has a gambling problem. 

The custodian, who has paid his three hundred dollllfs for a 
chance to win, has seen the best experts lose it all. Mr. Sports 
Haven, pushing 65, was there that afternoon when they counted up 
their losses. Mr. Sports Haven earned his name when he made 
$27,000 in one day. You could say he saw the future--that is, until 
he turned around and lost every penny of it. He is still trying to win 
it back. 

The custodian used to work as a clerk at the Plainfield dog 
cracks in New Jersey before he moved to New Haven and made 
Sports Haven his second home. He has seen traders shoot up the 
dogs to make them run faster, he has seen people win $39,000 in 
one day and then blow it all in a couple of hours. He knows now 
that no matter what the brochures tell you about it being a game of 
skill and education, when it comes right down to it, there are no 
experts and anything can happen to anybody. Even to the best. 

Today, the custodian is back to gamble on the horses. Dogs are 
his specialty, but he knows that sometimes luck can be a lady. A 
couple years ago--this was over at Plainfield-a lady with tarot 
cards served him luck on a silver platter. She laid her cards out and 
looked right at him and said: "Five, eight, and six are your lucky 
numbers." When it came time for the races, he looked at the num-
bers written out on a slip of paper. Then he studied the odds on the 
screen and handicapped. He sat down and watched as the dogs set 
out from their starting pins and raced around the track. The little 
number five passed the line, followed by number eight, and right 
after that number six, who brought up the rear. The custodian had 
lost his shot at $I3o,ooo. 

The table where the custodian gambles, has seen a lot of loss-
es. But it has been good to the ones who lose. It brings them back 
every afternoon and every night and into the morning and gives 
them a place to go. But if the custodian could have one day back-
the day when he first walked through Sports Haven's doors-he 
would turn around and walk right back out. Knowing now what he 
didn't know then, no questions asked, he would never have started 
to bet. Because in this game, he says, you always lose. 


**A Life at the Races**
**Page number(s): 29-30**

A MAN ow ENOUGH to be the custodian's father is working on his 
.flhobby while the countdown to the Aqueduct race begins in 
Queens. Frank Aureimma is sitting quietly, alone at a large table in 
the non-smoking section near the wash-closet. He breathes deeply, 
looks up at the race countdown on the screen, and turns back to the 
newspaper resting in his hands. He has a broad face and wide-
spaced eyes and seems to be in no particular hurry. 

When Frank set out from his home in Long Island, his wife 
threw her arms around him and said, "Go get 'em kid." When he 
arrived at Sports Haven, his son called him on his cell phone to say 
hello. It didn't always used to be like this. 

Frank grew up at the races. He lived four blocks from 
Aqueduct, the track that is now coming into focus on the screen 
above him. By fifteen, Frank was already making the walk to 
Aqueduct and gambling there every day. By 20, he was gambling 
twice a day. By 30, the losses were building up and up and Frank 
was banging his head into walls. The addiction had settled in and 
made itself at home. The races had become more important than 
family. It was around this time that Frank cashed in and bought a 
horse himself, a trotter named Three 0 One. 

Three 0 One helped break the strength of the addiction. For 
the first time, Frank saw the gambling's seemy underbelly. He was 
there when Three 0 One got sick, he learned about all the ailments 
that can plague a horse and upset even the best handicapper's analy-
sis. Frank began to put all his energies into the horse, and away 
from gambling. He eventually became the proud owner of twelve 
horses. The addiction was slowly being pushed away, forced now to 
sit at the very base of his chair. It is still there, he says, and it will 
never leave. But for the past 30 years, he has been the one in con-
trol. 

"Must have gone through a billion 
dollars before I found it out," he muses 
today. This man, the President of Carvel 
Ice Cream, has finished in the top four in 
at least four recent handicapping tourna-
ments. He has forbidden his children and 
grandchildren to gamble. "There's really 
nothing to be derived as a positive thing 
when it comes to this," he says solemnly in 
the lull before the races start. "There's a lot 
of people that shouldn't be gambling." 

Frank himself is here for the sheer 
pleasure of the mental challenge that the 
races present. He is here because of the 
good fun that comes from handicapping, 
one of his favorite hobbies. And because he 
is still trying to get back the 20 dollars he 
lost in 1955. He smiles. He is still chasing 
his losses.

ence from the inside, trailing c/ou 
behind numb" seven. Numb" seven 
is stili holding onto h" six length 
lead, numb" five is cutting the dif-
ference, number six leading now by
