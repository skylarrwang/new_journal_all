AFTER A DANCE LAST OCTOBER, Jane's blind 
date started to come on very aggressively. 
"All of a sudden we were having sex. There 
was no condom. I asked, 'Did you come?' 
And he said, 'No."' He was lying. Five years 
ago, Jane would have faced an agonizing 
wait to find out if she was pregnant. 
Instead, Jane went to Yale University 
Health Services the morning after, took an 
emergency contraceptive, and did not get 
pregnant. 
In 1998, two kinds of emergency con-
traception, Plan-B and Preven, went on the 
us market. Taken within 120 hours of inter-
course, the pills prevent pregnancy by 
inhibiting ovulation, inhibiting fertiliza-
tion, or prohibiting a fertilized egg from 
.. 
implanting in the uterus. Emergency con-
traception aims to fill a big need: contra-
ceptives fail, people forget to use protec-
tion, and, in the worst cases, women don't 
have the choice to use protection. And it 
works. A study conducted last year by the 
Alan Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive 
rights agency based in New York, estimated 
that the availability of emergency contra-
ception accounted for a 43 percent decrease 
in the number of abortions performed 
nationwide. 
The Guttmacher Institute, however, 
also found that only one woman in ten is 
aware of emergency contraception, a dis-
tressing.finding given that half of all preg-
nancies are unintended. In New Haven, 
which has one of the highest teen pregnan-
cy rates in the state, school and public 
health officials have tried to counter this 
persistent ignorance by integrating infor-
mation on emergency contraception into 
high school health courses. This effort, 
however, is all too ofren undermined by the 
reality of women's reproductive care: 
Ideological battles have eclipsed the welfare 
of the patient as a primary concern. Anti-
abortion groups consider emergency con-
traception a form of abortion, and doctors, 
according to Kirsten Moore, the president 
of the Reproductive Health Tecnhologies 
Project, are in many cases not letting their 
patients know their options. In focus 
groups she conductS, most of the women 
involved say their doctors have never even 
mentioned emergency contraception. The 
Catholic-affiliated St. Raphael's Hospital, 
New Haven's second-largest health care 
provider, refuses to tell patients anything 
about emergency contraception. Even a 
rape victim will hear nothing of the option. 
Access to emergency contraception is 
often blocked because of censorship of 
medical information by groups with reli-
gious and political agendas. This month, 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
will receive a petition from the makers of 
Plan-B 
over-the-counter 
status. 
"Approval is supposedly a nonpolitical 
process," Moore says. But the case, which 
will 
be 
evaluated 
by 
FDA's 
Reproductive 
Health 
Drug 
Policy 
Advisory Committee, leaves much room 
for worry. The committee was appointed 
by President Bush and includes Dr. W. 
David Hager, an oBIGYN who along with 
other members of the panel has strong ties
