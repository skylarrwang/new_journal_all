I N THE WEEKS LEADING UP TO LAST YEAR'S 
gubernarorial election, two-term Governor 
John Rowland found himself the object of 
an unlikely attack given his usual populari-
ty in hard-on-crime-soft-on-caxes circles. 
Rowland, speaking on the record with a 
reporter, had dropped the word "decrimi-
nalization" inro a discussion of state drug 
policy. When ami-crime crusaders, the 
media, and strategists for the Democratic 
opponent seized on the (apparently taboo) 
term, Rowland's handlers went into dam-
age-control mode: The Governor would 
never, 
they 
assured, 
"decriminalize drug use"; he 
meant simply that "the state 
must work harder" to keep 
non-violent drug offenders 
in rehabilitation and out of 
prison, where jailhouse drug 
dealers far outnumber viable 
treatment options. 

And indeed, Rowland's 
record on that front was 
strong. 
Until 
last year, 
Connecticut boasted one of 
the nation's most extensive 
networks of drug courts. 
Busted users could sidestep 
jail by submitting them-
selves to the authority of a 
lone judge who would guide 
them thr~ugh local rehabilitation pro-
grams, checking on their progress in 
biweekly meetings. When a urine test or a 
subsequent arrest revealed continuing use, 
he could wag a stern, fatherly finger and 
impose a tailor-made punishment, fash-
ioned in consult with counselors, lawyers, 
and social workers familiar with the indi-
vidual case. 

The drug courts were, in their day, a 
principal component of a statewide alterna-
tive sentencing program that sought to 
replace the principle of retribution with the 
principle of rehabilitation. Last year, how-
ever, New Haven's drug court closed its 
doors. Ir was the vicrim of a statewide bud-
gee crisis that is forcing the Republican 
FEBRUARY 2003 
governor to cut almost $1.5 billion in state 
services. As the slashing and burning con-
tinued, the in- and out-patient rehabilita-
tion clinics that treat court-sentenced users 
were similarly hard hit: In November, 
Rowland announced that he would cut 
funding for alternative sentencing pro-
grams by over $5 million, ten percent of 
their total annual budget. "These were pro-
grams operating on the fringe of their bud-
get," says Nora Duncan, who oversees 
alternative incarceration centers for the 
Connecticut Association of Nonprofits. 

"There was no fat to trim, so they'll have to 
cut beds or dose down." 

Since its launch in 1990, some 50,000 
non-violent offenders have passed through 
Connecticut's Alternative Incarceration 
Program. Most of them were facing prison 
for the first time, and many were addicts 
driven to criminality by an expensive 
habit-in short, exactly the type of offend-
er once herded into perpetually overflow-
ing prisons in astounding numbers. 

Alternative sentencing diverted most non-
violent drug offenders (excluding those 
involved in heavy dealing) into indepen-
dent, state-funded treatment centers, 
where they could serve our their sentences 
in rehabilitation sessions, therapy groups, 
job training, and community service pro-
jects. The idea was to keep people away 
from the hardening environs of a correc-
tional facility and instead ship them, as one 
New Haven drug counselor puts it, "out 
into society as full people and productive 
citizens." 

The results were unequivoca11y posi-
tive. In th e regular prison system, recidi-
vism rates for drug offenders are astronom-
ical; a recent Department of Justice study, 
for example, found that 66 percent of drug 
convicts are back in court within three 
years of their release. In New 
Haven, treatment centers like 
the APT Foundation-the 
state's second largest rehabili-
tation facility-report that 70 
percent of patients who com-
plete its program stay not 
only out of jail, but clean as 
well. "It doesn't matter if 
they're forced by a judge ro 
come," explains Allen Brown, 
APT's Chief Executive Officer. 

"No matter how you got into 
it, if you complete your treat-
ment, you're many times 
more likely to stay clean than 
someone who didn't." 

- APT ca1ls itself a "thera-
peutic community" for drug 
offenders. "It's an intense experience," 
Brown says. "In a program like ours, you're 
committed to a treatment process, and you 
have to work at it. Every once in a while 
someone will say, 'I'd rather be in a prison, 
this is too hard.'" In fact, APT has built itself 
into a mostly self-sustaining facility, where 
patients early in the treatment process work 
various jobs in the building, which serves, 
in addition to its 100 residents, 1500 non-
resident users, half of whom are there at the 
behest of a court. As patients "become 
more stable and more able ro cope," they 
go out into the community to perform ser-
vice or hold down a job, the proceeds of 
which 
subsidize 
their 
treatment. 
Eventually, Brown claims, they "reenter 
society as healthy, employable members of 
a community." 

As the effects of budget cuts trickle 
down from state agencies,, the damage to 
centers like APT is becoming evident. 
According to Duncan, almost 200 alterna-
tive incarceration slots have already been 
eliminated, and there are rumblings that 
several treatment centers may have to close. 
"Social ramifications aside, this is going to 
mean Â·a strain on the prison system," she 
notes. It's hard not to see the cuts as a pecu-
liar kind of policy regression: Alternative 
sentencing was adopted by pragmatists 
searching for a solution to prison over-
crowding, not bleeding hearts preaching 
the virtues of compassion. Curiously, we're 
back where we started: slashing alternatives 
and sending non-violent drug offenders 
back into overflowing prisons. 

What is most ironic about Rowland's 
spending decisions, however, is that centers 
like APT have proven not only that they can 
handle drug cases better-their recidivism 
rate for drug offenders, after all, is barely 
half the figure of the state prison system-
but that their services carry a lower price 
tag as well. On average, an alternative 
incarceration program spends $7,000 on a 
patient in a year. It costs, on the other 
hand, $25,000 a year to keep someone 
behind bars. (Despite a fourfold increase, 
from $100 million to $400 million, in 
spending on prisons over the course of the 
1990s, Department of Corrections officials 
still complain of massive shortfalls.) 

Government estimates confirm the long-
term financial benefits: Connecticut has 
saved over $619 million by diverting rela-
tively paltry sums from prisons to treat-
ment centers. 

But the rwisted political logic of bud-
get cuts, crime fighting, and the War on 
Drugs supercedes whatever fiscal and 
human benefits alternative sentencing pro-
vides. Brown offers a scholastic analogy: 
"When cuts are happening, prisons are like 
high-school football programs. They're 
always the least vulnerable. Drug treatment 
is like the marching band or advanced 
physics"-the first thing to go. Ultimately, 
few people disagree with the wisdom of 
alternative sentencing. But unfortunately, 
in sound-byte form, "tough on crime" 
always beats out "smart on drugs."
