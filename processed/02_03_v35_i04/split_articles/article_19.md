EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
as a little boy, was once left alone in an OTB 
in Norwalk will drive up to the back door 
of St. Brendan's church. He will have come 
for 
his 
first 
session 
at 
Gambler's 
Anonymous. He will make his way to the 
basement. It will be silent, save for the hum 
of the overhead lights that run the length of 
the long room filled with cafeteria-style 
tables. Flat pink walls will frame a stage at 
one end of the cold room. Jason will sit 
down at a table to talk, because his life is 
spiraling out of control. He lost it all. H e 
wants his life back, but he doesn't know 
how to do it. 

At night he can't sleep. He eats fast 
food because he doesn't have time to cook. 
He can't be away from the phone because 
he has to know the score. He gambles for 
the action, for the constant hope of making 
the score. 

When he finishes his story, he will 
look down at the table where the old 
ladies play bingo. Thirteen compulsive 
gamblers, sitting in a horseshoe, will 
clap. The former pro-baseball player, 
who was released from the team in 1967 
and turned to gambling and walked into 
his own world, his own cellar where 
$8o,ooo disappeared the next year, will 
tell Jason it will be alright. A teacher will 
tell Jason he understands his story. The 
salesman, who used to lie to his wife, will 
offer advice. (He would tell his wife he 
was going to the mall. He'd drive right 
up to the mall and right on through it. 
He'd stop at the OTB in Hamden tO place 
his bet, drive home, add lie in bed with 
his ear next to the radio on low so as not 
to wake his wife because he had to hear 
the scores.) 

These a.re the gamblers who some 
would lab~l the "degenerates": the ones 
who have lost control of gambling. They 
will remember that the closest friendship 
you have when you're a gambler is with 
the mailman who brings the bills-the 
$1000 telephone bill to the sports line to 
bet on the horses, the five pages of cash 
advances to make up for the losses. They 
will remember that the main link with 
the world is the phone booth-where 
you step inside and slip in your dime and 
hope for the best. They will remember 
the kind of hoping that makes you forget 
your twin daughters sitting in a locked 
car, waiting half an hour for their father 
to return from scratching the lotto ticket. 

Jason will listen to these stories and 
will know that he has found where some-
one knows what it means to be addicted to 
gambling. Tonight the compulsive gam-
blers in the room will be calm. Some of 
them will be the most serene they've been 
in years. They will be far away from the 
OTB stadiums, where the final scores for the 
best and dedicated handicappers are now 
being posted. 

T
HE FINAL SCORES have been tallied. 
The hobbyist, who held third place for 
the better part of the morning, finished 
tenth out of a 340 contestants. He is dri-
ving home to his family with $2,550 of con-
test money in his pocket. He is looking for-
ward to attending another tournament in 
July, where he will use his skill to master 
the game. The custodian finished in the 
top 50, with his name posted on the web-
site. He will be back to Sports Haven. And 
as for the defending champion: When Beef 
drove home to the Bronx last year with his 
$40,000 check in the back seat, he drove 
home blind. He thought he was going to 
die. The check took up the whole of his 
back window. He drove through a rain-
storm so bad he couldn't see where he was 
going or what was coming up from behind. 
The champion made it home, went to the 
pub, bought everyone a drink, and woke 
up the next day at 3:30 in the afternoon. 
This year, Beef drove home on a losing 
ticket. Despite all his expertise, despite hav-
ing picked many of the winning horses, 
Beef didn't even make it into the top two 
hundred finishers. But it was worth it, he 
says. He'll be back. Maybe not this year, 
but he'll be back.
