ARK I<INZLY STARTED DRINKING WHEN he was seven years old. 
He wanted to change the way he felt, and when he eyed the 
cool lines of a liquor bottle it seemed an obvious place to start. This 
youthful experiment launched a 2o-year career in drug abuse. At the 
height ofKinzly's addiction he used anything he could get his hands 
on-crack, heroin, prescription drugs. Addiction bankrupted him 
and spawned a complementary nihllism. He moved to Cumberland 
County, Maine, to work as a commercial fisherman, one of the 
most dangerous jobs in America. Trips lasted for days at a time, and 
Kinzly spent his winters bent at the waist and knees, hauling trawls 
loaded with 20-pound sea bass. Fortunately, Kinzly already knew 
how to ease the pain of the ocean's beating. "When you're in the 
middle of the Atlantic in February it's pretty fucking cold and tak-
ing a narcotic can really help," he recalls. 

Maine includes some of the poorest rural areas in the country. 
Work for many Mainers is physically excruciating. They stoop to 
rake blueberries, stoop to chop pine trees, or, as Mark did, stoop to 
pull 6o-pound lobster traps out of So-foot waters. When they need 
to self-medicate, instead of turning to urban drugs like heroin and 
cocaine, Mainers more often go to their doctor's office or local phar-
macy, or they just open a medicine cabinet stocked with orange 
cylinders of prescription drugs. Lately, rural Maine's pain reliever of 
choice has been OxyContin, a powerful new opiate first released in 
1996. 

Anyone who watched television or read the newspaper could 
hardly have missed it: 2001 was the year of OxyContin. In the 
spring, a group of young men wearing baseball caps and bandanas 
over their faces held up a dozen Boston pharmacies and demanded 
OxyContin at gun-point. The Boston Globe carried a dozen articles 
on the robbery, and named OxyContin "the hottest drug on the 
street." On July 29, a cover story in the Nnu York Tima Magazine 
followed addicts in Man, West Virginia, where every trailer seemed 
toÂ·be a drug den, and every Medicaid recipient a hardened dealer of 
"hillbilly heroin." On back-to-back nights in December, css's 48 
Hours and MTV's True Lifo series showcased Maine srudent Troy 
Swett's futile efforts to kick his OxyContin habit. Much as cocaine 
and crack had in the 1980s, OxyContin was revolutionizing drug 
habits. It promised to ravage the nation.
