The Future of an

N SEPTEMBER 1968, RicHARD NtxoN STEPPED up to a podium 
and uttered a few words that changed the course of history: "As I 
look over the problems in this country, I see one that stands our." 
What Nixon called "the modern curse of the youth" was encourag-
ing crime, fostering apathy, and "decimating a generation of 
Americans." The scourge was narcotics, and the remedy that Nixon 
proposed-the War on Drugs-has not only endured, but also per-
manently infiltrated American discourse. On that day, drugs 
became part of a netherworld, the realm of outsiders and 
sociopaths. They became a symbol of sickness, dystopia, decay, 
poverry, and anomie. They became, in Nixon's words, "just like the 
plagues and epidemics of former years." 


More than chirry years later, these notions of disease and 
degeneracy resurface in Nick McDonell's novel Tw~/v~. Penned 
when McDonell was seventeen and soon to matriculate at Harvard,

T~/w follows protagonist "White Mike" as he tours depraviry and 
nihilism in the world of spoiled Manhattan private sch~ol kids. 
Though White Mike has deferred admission to college for a year to 
selJ drugs on the streets of New York, he is meant to be an outsider 
to this culture of depraviry. He deals drugs but refuses to take them. 
He goes to parties but never drinks. He knows everyone but has no 
real friends. He is an observer, one who is attracted to, but cannot 
ultimately identify with, decadence. 


And, oh, is the immoraliry copious! We watch with White 
Mike as his peers pay with sex for expensive drugs, including che

mysterious, titular "Twdve"; tartoo their names in gold on their 
backs; ponder cutting school, flying down co Key West, and getting 
"shitfaced and laid all the time"; and even kill each other with .38 
calibers and uzis. It is a hopeless world, a milieu that is frightening 
and bleak, which we are reminded of alJ too often by White Mike's 
habit of re-reading Camus's Th~ Plague.

If the world of Twelv~ is scary, however, it is also familiar. 
Decadence means more than just drugs, alcohol, sex, and violence: 
It also means consumption of brand name luxuries. Characters 
invariably buy their dope with Nokia phones in hand, North Face 
jackets on their backs, and Prada bags over their shoulders. The 
clever and ironic idea at work here is that mainstream American 
consumerism and decadent drug use aren't all that different. This 
parallel is of great concern to McDonell. Like Brec Easton Ellis's 
classic Less Than Zero (the book from which McDonell shamelessly 
cribbed his plot) and Larry Clark's film Kids, Tw~lv~ identifies a 
societal problem and revels in the tragedy of it all. It is an extrava-
ganza of futility. If only we didn't live in such a screwed up, materi-
alistic world, McDonell piously laments. 


This mostly hackneyed portrayal suggests that systemic condi-
tions-capitalism, perhaps-might be at work. But McDonell 
never follows through on this move. In the end, his assessment of 
his characters' lives hinges on a simple, puritanical moral judgment: 
that they are participating in a corrupt, materialist culture. This is a 
Nixonian horror-drugs and luxury goods drive people to harm 
themselves physically, to prostitute themselves, and to kill each 
other. McDonell, who, according to The New l0rk", does "no ille-
gal substances" and was class president at his New York prep school, 
essentially succumbs to the myth that drugs are something of an 
exotic disease, one that is ruining our world. But we don't have co 
descend into that netherworld if we try hard enough, he says. We 
can espouse moderation and resist, or at lease escape. We can be like 
Whire Mike, who goes off co Paris at the end of the book and 
opines, "I don't know why, but Paris seems a better place than New 
York." 


Twelve represents the muddle that is the current debate on 
drugs. Most of us probably agree with McDonell's assessment of the 
drug situation, even if we discan.ce ourselves from the governmen tal 
pontification that says the same thing. We agree that most drugs are 
unhealthy in some way, that the drug trade can be exploitative and ' 
dangerous, that drugs can inhibit one's ability to succeed in life. We 
share a basic understanding that some kind of societal change is 
needed. But beyond that common sentiment, no consensus exists.

No one knows how to solve the problem. 
Every solution either fails-as in the case of 
our government's War on Drugs-or is 
vague and implausible. In plaC<e of a viable 
course of action, we spout some form of 
Nixonian rhetoric: drugs are bad; they're 
not good for society; we must be vigilant in 
our crusade against them. 


But could it be that the very impulse 
to ask, "What should we do about drugs?" 
stems from a deeper condition? This is the 
approach that journalist Charles Bowden, 
who spent more than half a decade along 
the United States-Mexico border reporting 
the drug trade, takes in his bold new book 
Down by th~ River. Bowden's conclusion, 
which he arrives at through telling the story 
of a Drug F.nforcement Agency head whose 
brother was mysteriously murdered in 1995, 
is that American society is intimately 
bound up in the Mexican drug trade. 
Accordingly, our urge to call it a "problem" 
reflects our fear and confusion in the face 
of a pervasive and ungovernable force. 
-NO-One knows for sure how large the 
global drug economy is, but one thing is 
dear: It redistributes hundreds of billions 
of dollars across the earth every year. 
Bowden estimates that the drug industry 
brings between S27 and S32 billion to 
Mexico each year. That is about $20 billion 
more than oil, the cOuntry's largest official 
export. For Bowden, this fact reveals one of 
the most urgent-and most ignored-sto-
ries of our time: that the drug economy 
and the legal economy are one and the 
same, that the effects felt on either side 
reverberate across both. If Mexico were to 
lose the S30 billion that drugs pump into 
the economy, the country would simply 
collapse. Ten percent of the nation's gross 
domestic product would vanish. A study 
leaked to the press by the Mexican internal 
security agency CISEN guesses that the 
country's economy would shrink by as 
much as 63 percent. The same study pins 
the us decline between 19 and 22. percent. 
For Bowden, the accuracy of these fig-
ures is questionable. But as someone who 
has experienced the drug business first-
hand, his gut tells him that the underlying 
condition the numbers imply is accurate. 
What's more, the very condi_tion itself pre-
dudes -as from gaining access to concrete 
facts. All we have are Oeeting peeks into the 
inner workings of an endemically corrupt 
international drug network. There is the 
record of a S300 million transfer of money 
from Citibank by one of the richest drug 
dealers in Mexico, Amado Carillo; there is 
the taped conversation between the us 
Attorney General and the CIA director 
hushing drug-related crimes by CIA agents; 
there are the accounts of Carillo offering a 
deal to Mexican President Ernesto Zcdillo 
that included the transfer of half of 
Carillo's fortune to the government in 
exchange for immunity. None of this 
amounts to anything concrete. That may 
sound like the apology of a conspiracy the-
orist, but Bowden never pretends to be 
writing an objective account. His gossamer 
prose intends only to be suggestive. 


Our inability to comprehend the 
workings of the drug world is one of the 
reasons that Bowden thinks we tend to 
push drugs into the margins of daily life 
with other seemingly ineradicable ills, like 
poverty and guns. Like White Mike, we 
feel the need to call drugs a "problem" in 
order to deal with them. We put drugs in 
another "world" in order to localize and 
convenie'ntly distance ourselves from them. 
We even fight a War on Drugs, as we woUld 
against some distant country. But Bowden 
thinks that such reasoning only succumbs 
to a convenient illusion. To leave the drug 
"problem" to be solved by someone else in 
a far off place is to deny that we are all 
implicated in it. Bowden wants us to call 
the drug world a "business," to see dru~ as 
a multi-billion-dollar industry enmeshed in 
the 
same 
economic 
network 
as 
McDonald's, Ford, Microsoft, and Pfizer, 
so that the drug trade can be perceived, in 
his words, as "elemental and part of the 
fabric of" the United States, Mexico, and 
the rest of the world. It is a chilling 
thought, but it seems to speak some truth. 
It starts to explain how something not 
much different from Prozac could hold 
such a powerful place in the public imagi-
nation. 


Part of Bowden's motivation for bring-
ing the drug economy in line with the legal 
economy has to do with globalization. 
Though he does not say so explicitly, 
Bowden believes that the term "legal econ-
omy" may no longer be the most accurate 
way to describe any economy. Over the 
past several decades, corporations have 
become increasingly transnational-state-
less, in other words-and the difference 
between black markets and legal markets 
has diminished. Bowden goes so far as to 
call the Juarez cartel, one of the largest drug 
distributors in the world, a "model of the 
New Economy" -a description normally 
reserved for corporations that constantly 
move labor and capital across national bor-
ders in the pursuit of profits. The cartel, he 
says, is "stateless, borderless, global." It 
"rewards merit, ignores class origins," 
"hires and fires at will," and "despises regu-
lations and ducks tariffs." And as in all 
good businesses, the profits are colossal. 


This is a fascinating move, one that 
Bowden delicately weaves into his haunting 
narrative. Why, after all, should we think 
that drug cartels are any different from 
transnatio~al corporations, if both share 
similar contempt for the law? 


Where Bowden hedges on taking a 
moral stand on drugs, Ann Marlowe, in 
How to Stop Time: Hn-oin from A to Z, is 
more explicit. Marlowe's book is an autobi-
ographical account of a life spent as a hero-
in addict, but it is one like few others: that 
of a Harvard-educated yuppie who never 
truly became addicted to the drug, even 
after dozens of years. On the surface, 
Marlowe's story is interesting as an odd and 
anomalous account. As she hints early on, 
however, this surface oddity is merely a 
device for making a much bolder point: 
that she is not so much the exception as the 
rule among heroin and other drug users. 
She believes that addictive drugs are a 
choice, one ultimately not very different 
from others we make as consumers on a 
daily basis. 


Marlowe's thesis is that both serious 
drug use and commonplace consumption 
play into what she calls a "consumerist ide-
ology" that most people sublimate on a 
daily basis. The idea isn't so much that 
drugs are just another commodity, but the 
reverse--that aU commodities in our soci-
ety function like addictive drugs. The 
impulse to consume lots of things is, in 
other words, on par with the desire to do 
drugs. Marlowe is able to argue this 
because, in her opinion, addictioQ is con-
trollable. This was her experience as a hero-
in user, at least. She led a rich, intellectual 
life-both at Harvard graduate school and 
in the New York business world-that 
revolved around consistent, planned drug 
use, and she quit without difficulty. 


Marlowe doesn't deny that some drugs 
cause chemical dependency, but she
