the Smiths was more than most targets of 
ECCO actions receive. "We've never paid 
this much attention to the aftermath before 
because it's not our business. Ecco is not a 
social work agency," he said. Still, the 
Colvilles' intimacy with their neighbors left 
them little choice but to take note of the 
aftermath. An ECCO pastor, the Reverend 
Scott Marks, went to the Smiths' home to 
offer his help to Quincy, ironically, on the 
day after the ECCO rally had kicked him 
out. Quincy of course was not in, and 
Marks's words seemed wasted on Barbara, 
who said she wanted to see her son reform 
but doubted that anyone could make him 
do it. Hoping to help Quincy join Job 
Corps or another outreach program, Marks 
gave Barbara his phone number and called 
her once afterwards. She did not respond. 
When I visited, Barbara was still talk-
ing about the possibility of Quincy joining 
Job Corps. With her son dividing his time 
between friends' houses and only returning 
home for occasional, illegal visits-"when 
he needs clean clothes"-Barbara seemed 
to have few other aspirations for her son to 
latch onto. "I really, really tried to convince 
his mother that she needed to help me to 
get this meeting set up with Quincy," 
Marks said later. "Basically she just doesn't 
have any control and that was clear." The 
blame does not lie with Quincy's mother 
alone, he added. Single mothers in New 
Haven fuce an almost insurmountable bur-
den just trying to pay rent with low wage 
service jobs, let alone spend time with their 
children. "That means there's going to be 
some hustling, part time job here, part time 
job there," explained Marks. 

Marks did not agree that Quincy had 
been ill-served by the community activists 
who hollered him off Rosette Street in 
November. Quincy's lifestyle left no other 
choice-if not for his departure, Quincy's 
neighbors would have wimessed his violent 
demise at the hands of other young men 
resigned to life on the streets. "I've been on 
the street and stood over the bodies of guys 
who've had that happen to them," Marks 
said resolutely. "Then you can rally all you 
want to but nothing is going to bring them 
back."
