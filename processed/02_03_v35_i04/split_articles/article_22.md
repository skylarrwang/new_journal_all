T
HE DEATH OF THE AMERICAN specialty 
shop is old news. For years we've 
watched, with mixed emotions, the rise of 
Targets and Wal-Marts and Super-Ks: 
monuments to entrepreneurial gumption. 
A modern American city boasts neither 
panaderias nor gelaterias, and nary a zapa-
teria; any visiting Parisian in search of a 
wheel t>f roquefort will find his hunger sat-
isfied not off some cobblestone road but" on 
the refrigerated shelving of the dairy aisle. 

And yet, despite the rhetoric, there are 
those hardy establishments that have 
endured the consolidation of consumption 
and remain kicking.


It is fitting that the Owl Shop, one of 
New Haven's only specialty shops, caters co 
a uniquely American obsession. The 
College Street store is a "Tobacco Cafe," 
the product of a nation obsessed with 
tobacco-not so much with its consump-
tion as with debating its moral legitimacy. 
The legal history of the "dirty weed" is as 
old as this country, and modern litigation 
asks: Where on the spectrum of admissible 
behavior are we to place the pastime? 
Tobacco regulation lies at the intersection 
of temperance and civil liberty, rwo quin-
tessentially American virtues. 

For Joe Lentine, a gaunt, amicable 
man and the general manager of the Owl 
Shop, the answer is clear: Smoking is both 
enjoyable and virtuous. "Tobacco increases 
the alpha waves in the brain," which are 
ass9ciated with a state of relaxation, he 
say~. Sure, there ace health risks. But "we all 
start the process of dying the minute we're 
borh." 

Mr. Lentine lives his philosophy. 
Seated near the shop window with a cigar 
and a pensive air, he is a man steadfast and 
comfortable in his dominion. When he 
stands to assist a customer, he exudes the 
confidence of a salesman whose produce 
sells icselÂ£ Behind Mr. Lentine is a paltry 
display of cigarettes, ("We don't scock 
many; cigarettes are associated with addic-
cion" says an employee named Jesse.) To his 
left are a dozen canisters of blended tobac-
co. Across the store, which is carpeted with 
a thick, absorbent brown shag, is a glass 
case exhibiting music boxes, chess sets, and 
backgammon boards. The shop sells cigars 
(the fmest, says Mr. Lentine, are made by 
Davidoff), lighters, pipes and accessories, 
even breath mints. 

Although the store is welcoming and 
the staff is well-versed, there is the sense 
chat secrets ace unfurled only slowly and 
only to those who take time to listen. The 
Owl Shop is a refuge for the dawdler and 
the connoisseur, lending credence to Joe 
Lentine's notion that cigars and pipes make 
for "contemplative smoking." One Yale 
sophomore explained, "I enjoy browsing 
the fine selection. When you ask the right 
questions, the tobacconist will really begin 
to talk." 

The Owl Shop provides more than 
selection and service. It is also a meeting 
place. Regulars gather to converse and 
smoke, filling the dowdy and smoke-
infused armchairs in the back of the store. 
Mr. Lentine calls his clientele varied: a 
handful of professors, some members of the 
community, and a surprising number of 
Yale students. Most of the younger smokers 
belong to what he classifies as "the artistic 
type"-"actors, writers, creative people." 

The connections forged to the shop are 
deep, with many alumni continuing to buy 
products through mail order long after they 
graduate. 

When the Owl Shop was opened in 
1934, it was located next door to Naples 
Restaurant and served as a sort of Yale co-
op, selling caps, shires, and notebooks in 
addition to the signature products. In 1951, 
it moved to its current location across from 
the Shubert Theater, and visiting luminar-
ies began to call. "Arthur Miller used co 
stop in when he had a show up," says Mr. 
Lentine. "AA Pacino came in once to gee his 
lighter fixed." 

The 1960s and 70s saw a renewed 
interest in cigars and especially pipes, due 
in part to a 1964 Surgeon General's report 
decrying the dangers of smoking-ciga-
rettes were deemed far more pernicious 
than ocher forms of tobacco. (According to 
Mr. Lentine, Luther Terry, then surgeon 
general, was himself an avid pipe smoker.) 
About ten years ago, the Owl Shop noticed 
an immense resurgence in the popularity of 
cigars. "The magazine Cigar Aficionado sin-
gle-handedly brought on this revolution," 
says Mr. Lentine, because it created a new 
image of the cigar smoker. "Cigars began to 
denote that you had power, that you were a 
power broker. Smoking makes you feel rich 
even if you're not rich." 

Recently, tobacco seems to have taken 
a few blows in the legal arena. Now that 
America's relationship to cigarettes, and 
even to cigars, has become somewhat more 
antagonistic, is Mr. Lentine worried about 
the future? His answer is a definitive 'no.' 
He cites the historical involvement of the 
government-for better or for worse--in 
the fate of tobacco. In the 18TH century the 
crop was legal tender in the state of 
Virginia. Tobacco has a far greater yield per 
acre 
than 
corn 
or soybeans: 
The 
Agriculture Adjustment Act of 1933 was 
instituted to introduce price supports and 
save tobacco farmers from ruin. And the 
Owl Shop--forming, along with J. Press 
and Mory's, a sort of old school triumvirate 
around a University chat is often only 
amused by tradition-is standing its 
ground. These days, sales are strong, and 
for Joe Lentine, it's business as usual. After 
all, even as the ship was sinking, the gen-
tlemen of the Titanic sac down, L"l up, and 
enjoyed one lase smoke.
