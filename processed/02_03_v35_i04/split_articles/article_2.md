LET's CALL HIM PROFESSOR BROWN. In col-
lege, he had no trouble cutting loose. It was 
the late 1970s. Drugs and college just went 
together like rama, lama, lama, kadingy, 
kading-a-dong. The drinking age had not 
yet been raised. There was a joint at every 
party. He smoked a lot of pot. Most people 
did. It was a "climate of experimentation'': 
Cocaine, 
opium, 
hash, 
mushrooms, 
nitrous, acid-in fact, lots of acid. To this 
day, Professor Brown values every drug 
experience he ever had; he has no regrets. 

Three decades ago when he looked 
around en route to class, he saw drugs and 
lots of people doing them. Now, loo.king at 
students from the flip side of the academic 
equation, Professor Brown sees a very dif-
ferent scene: We fit comfortably inside the 
box and aim to strive within its bounds; 
few of us make bold statements with our 
appearance; we are eager to please our pro-
fessors; and of course, few of us experiment 
with drugs the way he did. There is, 
accorCling to his gauge, an atmosphere of 
unquestioning acceptance and not much of 
a margin at a place like Yale. And if there is, 
to choose the margin is ~o choose that 
which has already faded-the countercul-
ture Professor Brown found so cozy has 
been co-opted and marketed. The main 
concern is no longer "to avoid selling out." 

Instead, Professor Brown sees students who 
are preparing themselves to sell out better 
and faster than their parents. 

Sitting at his desk for afternoon office 
hours, Professor Brown is dressed comfort-
ably in a gray turtleneck sweater that is just 
shy of business casual. With no students on 
hand with questions, he confesses that he 
wishes more of them would get sroned 
once in while. Or rather, he wishes that 
they would be the kind of kids who would 
get stoned more readily, and more readily 
question professorial authority as well. He 
suggests the same for those professorial 
authorities, whose "tight-ass attitude," in 
Professor Brown's words, keep them but-
toned up well into the night. He calls the 
academic career a "life of quiet despera-
tion." One of his colleagues once said that 
she finds the faces of those around her 
"marked by the books they haven't read." 

To be sure, Professor Brown is nostal-
gic for his acid-dropping days, but-after a 
respite during the Reaganite 198os-he's 
.. 
managed to reincorporate drugs into his 
life. As a Yale professor, he confesses that he 
has little time to relax and experiment, but 
his monthly marijuana ritual is a guaran-
teed way to unwind from the high stress 
and fast pace of the work day. Of course, 
Professor Brown still appreciates its other 
effects on his "pretty type A" personality-
getting in touch with the sides of himself 
that stay suppressed in the normal profes-
sorial existence. Simple things, like "the 
pleasure of inhabiting a body" and "the 
beauty of the world." 

Professor Brown recalls a wedding he 
attended not long ago. Seconds after the 
recepti~n began, he and his wife made a 
bee-line for the bar. The only people ahead 
of them in line were rwo old ladies. He was 
expecting them to order a couple of screw-
drivers. Something that goes down easy 
and eventually gets the job done. He was 
wrong. They ordered scotch. Straight 
scotch. He thought that was right on. 
Wasting time is never a good thing. 

So now Professor Brown smokes pot 
once a month, drinks in moderation, does 
ecstasy with his wife, and imbibes the occa-
sional cup of "poppy-pod tea," a very mild 
form of opium which he "imagine(s] is 
legal." When asked why he doesn't do more 
of the harder stuff like he did in college, he 
responds wryly: It probably has to do with 
access.

ON SEPTEMBER 29, 1902, Carrie Nation 
came to Yale to save souls. O ne of 
America's best known temperance leaders, 
Nation was notorious for her habit of nor 
only condemning saloons, but destroying 
them with a hatchet as well. She caused a 
stir wherever she went, and Yale was no 
exception. Accounts vary as to how long 
she stayed in New Haven, but it was cer路 
tainly long enough to make a lasting 
impression. Seven years later, ..she would 
write, "It is a school of vice to a greal 
extent .... The controlling party at Yale . 路 路 
will desolate and enslave our darling 
boys." 

For Nation, the demise of"our darling 
boys" was part of a larger problem. The 
whole country was steadily moving down 
the path to hell, and liquor-or "devil路
