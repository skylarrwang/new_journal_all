EW AMONG THE CROWD that gathered in 
front of 209 
Rosette Street on 
November 12TH actually knew Quincy 
Smith. They had come to march in front of 
his mother's house because they knew his 
type. Since returning to the neighborhood 
lase spring, 19-year-old Quincy and his 
friends had occupied the front porch at 209 
Rosette, drinking, smoking, and selling 
drugs into the late hours of the night. 
Legally, Quincy was not even allowed to be 
there-his aunt, living upstairs, had filed a 
restraining order against him· several 
months earlier. Despite the growing tide of 
complaintS, his mother let him stay. The 
crowd was here to demand that Quincy 
move elsewhere. 

Holding candles and posters and 
chanting their demands-"freedom from 
drugs" and "safe streecs" -hundreds of peo-
ple marched in a circle in front of the drug 
dealer's house. At the center was the Smith's 
next door neighbor, Mark Colville, who 
lives with his wife, Luz, and children in the 
Amistad Catholic Workers' House. The 
Colvilles and another family founded the 
Amistad house nine years ago as a shelter 
organizing base for the people on 
Rosene Street, a decaying inner-city stretch 
a mile south of the Yale School of 
r-.I.VIle<litcu:te. When drug dealing on the block 
to spiral out of control last fall, the 
called on Elm City Congregations 
• 6 .u._.. ....... (ECco), an association of 18 city 
'CIIIUT•chc::s and non-profit groups, to round 
its members for an "action." 

Unlike most of the people who 
,.. .. ,.,, ...... up that night, Mark Colville knows 
Smiths personally. But that did not stop 
from seizing the megaphone and 
~n:1er1·1n2 Quincy to stop dealing or leave. 
crowd understood his frustration. 

Drug dealers bring more than drugs to a 
neighborhood-loud noise, broken bot-
des, and gang violence are inevitable 
byproduccs. A few days earlier a stray bullet 
had pierced the wall of the Colvilles' new-
born son's bedroom. 

The evening of the action was my first 
visit to Rosette Street. When I returned by 
the light of day I could see what the pro-
testers meant about the tokens of drug 
dealing. The sidewalk across from the 
Smiths' house was littered with empty 
liquor bottles; houses were boarded up; 
idling cars dotted the one-way street, giving 
the ominous impression of an active trade. 

Weeks after the march, I went back to 
find out whether the Smiths had finally 
turned out their deviant son, and to see 
how the Colvilles and the Smiths were get-
ting along in the state of mutual neighbor-
ly hatred that the rally had presumably 
engendered. As it turned out, though, once 
the dust had settled on Quincy's uncere-
monious expulsion, no one was more 
pleased to be rid of him than his own weary 
family. 

B
ARBARA AND DIANE SMITH look like sis-
ters, with slightly graying hair pulled 
back from tired, feminine faces. Before 
moving to 209 Rosette Street, they shared 
another house on Atwater Street in Fair 
Haven. When their landlord lost the lease 
there, the women immediately had co find 
someplace cheap. The brow"n house on 
Rosette Street with a sunken front porch 
and peeling paint was their best option. 
Barbara and her children had lived farther 
down Rosette Street before, but they had 
been forced to move after Quincy broke all 
the windows in that house, a stunt that 
landed him in juvenile hall until last 
spring. His move back home coincided 
with the family's return to their old neigh-
borhood, which was also home to Quincy's 
old friends. 

Diane has six kids. The youngest, 
John, is a year old. He has a strikingly full 
head of hair and is just beginning to string 
together tottering steps. Shortly before my 
visit, the oldest, IGta, had gotten an A on 
her AP European History midterm. She 
wants to study forensics, according to her 
mother, and she plans to go to the 
University of New Haven next year if the 
school offers her enough funding. "She 
used to want to be a pediatrician," Diane 
said with a chuckle. "But then she said she 
doesn't want to have to hurt people. 
Forensics is better because they're already 
dead." Barbara has four children besides 
Quincy, ages six, eight, 13 and 14. Peachy, a 
precocious eight-year old, is the only 
daughter. Three of the kids go to the 
Jebson Magner School, the same one 
attended by Mark and Luz Colville's kids 
next door. 

No one in the Smith house seems to 
miss Quincy. Day and night, Quincy's 
friends made the family's front yard a base 
for their own means of employment: using 
and dealing drugs, playing loud music, 
fighting amongst themselves, and fending 
off rivals from other streetS. "They hated 
it," recalled Diane, sitting on the couch in 
her sister's first floor living room. "They 
couldn't even go on rhe porch." Quincy 
himself was shot in the neck last summer 
while sitting in a parked car down the 
block. A few weeks earlier he had been 
beaten across the eyes with a wrench. (Luz 
Colville drove him to the hospital.) As the 
protesters chanted his name oucside the 
house in November, Quincy defended 
himself to a N~ Havm Register reporter: "I 
can't tell the drug dealers to leave. They'll 
shoot at me." 

Looking back, his mother speaks of 
her son's reckless habits with.quiet sympa-
thy. "I think in his own way he was scared," 
Barbara said. Yet Quincy, by all counts, was 
already beyond his mother's control, and 
the sisters' discomfort never thinned the 
crowd on the porch. "We could smell the 
gunpowder afterwards, right here on the 
porch," recalled Diane. The family was fre-
quently awakened by the ringing of the 
doorbell late into the night. When 
the police came, they were helpful 
and nosey at turns, but their depar-
ture was always marked by the 
quick return of Quincy's crowd, 

"If you don't have nobody to back 
you up, you belong to the · streets. 
You're going to die in the streets." 
with its stock of noise, drugs, and 
violence undiminished by the brief 
interruption. The presence of Quincy's 
mother didn't deter them either. "They 
knew exactly when I came and went. They 
knew my work schedule better than me," 
said Barbara incredulously. She locked any-
thing of value in the basement when she 
went out. She added, "It's nice to go 
Christmas shopping, and I don't have to 
worry about anything being gone when I 
come home." 

Barbara's solution was to throw up her 
hands and ignore the problem, remaining 
doggedly loyal to her son until the protest-
ers from ECCO arrived on the block, bring-
ing news vans, policemen, and a represen-
tative from the Livable City Initiative with 
them. After that, Quincy could no longer 
defy his aunt's restraining order by staying 
in the house. "He don't got no choice; he 
knows what's at stake," said his mother. 

Barbara expressed a vague hope that 
her son might join a city program to find a 
job and finish school, but her words 
sounded like the tired prayer of a mother 
with no idea what else to say. "I've got four 
other kids I've got to take care of, and 
they're trying to better themselves," she 
added. She is hopeful that her other sons, 
all avid basketball players in ECco's winter 
basketball league, will not follow in 
Quincy's footsteps. Barbara's only daughter, 
Peachy, is bright and talkative. Her cousin 
Alonna cuts a more staid figure. When 
Peachy declared her intention to marry a 
rich man, Alonna announced, "I'm not 
going to have kids. I'm going to adopt kids 
that are poor and need a home." 


T
HE FIRST TIME I WENT to the Amistad 
Catholic Workers' House next door, 
shortly after the action in November, the 
crowd was thin and none of the kids 
seemed too excited about the corn and 
chicken breasts on the table for dinner. The 
second time, the dining room was filled 
with over a dozen people, and the house 
had the air of a jovial winter retreat. 

Anyone is welcome to join the residents of 
the Amistad House for a meal; some of the 
guests that night, like James Davis, live at 
the house full-time while they beat a thank-
ful retreat from what the directors deem 
the life of sin. 

While Luz handles the cooking, Mark 
is generally busy planning and carrying out 
"community actions," targeting everything 
from war in Iraq to budget cuts for city ser-
vices to neighborhood drug dealers like 
Quincy. 

In the living room of the Amistad 
House, Mark still keeps the sign that he 
used to drive Quincy away this fall. It is a 
large white posterboard with writing in 
black marker: "THEY'RE DEALING DRUGS 
HERE!" When drug dealers appeared out-
side 209 Rosette Street two days after the 
initial rally, Mark began marching in front 
of the house by himself with his poster in 
hand. When Diane recalled the incident 
she added the obvious conclusion: "He's 
crazy." 

Since the one-man protest, the drug 
dealers have disappeared. The Colvilles 
came to the neighborhood to effect 
changes just like that, though they 
acknowledge that the effeets are ofren 
short-lived. "In this neighborhood and 
neighborhoods like this there's a lot of tran-
sition," Mark explained. The drug dealing 
and violence are endemic to the area, con-
tinually reinvigorated by waves of newcom-
ers who bring their trade along with their 
furniture. "Most people's solution to this is 
to try to make enough money to move out 
of the neighborhood." But families like the 
Smiths are swept in on a tide of eviction 
notices and bad luck; most of them prefer 
to shutter their windows and wait to be 
washed back out. "So every year is like an 
adventure," said Mark ruefully. 

Even Quincy used to come to the 
Amistad house. In recent months, he 
appeared a few times while high on drugs 
and told the Colvilles that he wanted to 
end his destructive lifestyle. Invariably, his 
resolve was gone by the next morning. "A 
lot of dealers used to come to tutoring 
here," sighed Luz wistfully. "I don't know 
when they decided they'd make more 
money drug dealing." Mark cut in abrupt-
ly: "And it's true." Given the poor 
quality of local schools and the lack 
of well-paying jobs throughout the 
city, he said, one might argue that the 
boys did have more to gain from hus-
tling than tutoring. "Here people 
grow up with the assumption that the 
system won't work for them. It's not 
designed to work for them," said Mark. 

But, as the Colvilles know, miracles are 
not impossible. James Davis, who has lived 
with them in the Amistad house for the last 
eight months, used to deal drugs on the 
same streets that Quincy now calls home. 
After his years of hustling and stints in jail, 
the police knew Davis by name and were 
quick to admonish him against loitering. 
"I'd tell them, I ain't got nowhere to go," he 
recounted after dinner at the Amistad 
house, watching Luz help Elizabeth with 
her homework. "It was about getting girls, 
getting money, and getting cars. That's it. 
We'd say, 'Stay fresh.' That's what you've 
got to do to stay fresh." Exiled from his 
mother's house nearby because of his rela-
tionship with his step-father, Davis spent 
most of his nights in the basement or stair-
well of a retirement home on Dewitt Street 
that he and his friends would break into for 
shelter. Because he did not get along with 
his stepfather, Davis, like Quincy, was not 
welcome at home. He could find only one 
alternative. "The streets are always open. 
The streets never dose. The streets always 
accept newcomers; they don't discriminate. 
If you don't have nobody to bac!t you up 
you belong to the streets. You're going to 
die in the streets," he said. "I stopped 
because I'm not ready to die yet." 

HERE IS SriLL HOPE, OF COURSE, that 
things will turn out as well for Quincy. 
Ecco's lead organizer, Pat Speer, said lacer 
that the little follow-up that was done with
