ternltles, would no longer be tolerated. 
University President A. Whitney Griswold 
could not comprehend why the state 
refused to distinguish between fraternity 
indiscretions and College-sanctioned social 
drinlcing: "I think we've all been too chick-
enhearted regarding these fraternities per 
se ... Can't some fine legal brain resolve this 
compromise? Isn't there a moral as well as a 
legal difference between giving carefully 
prepared and well-diluted punch to minors 
and selling them strong red eye under a 
license?" 

When fraternities were forced to shut 
down, the administration faced a new 
dilemma. The Council of Masters lament-
ed in 1956, "It is agreed that young men 
will learn to drir:1k and in the absence of 
fraternities will have to resort to such places 
of evil memory as Jigger McCarty's and the 
Paradise Inn, where liquor laws will also be 
ignored and where women of dubious 
virtue will be hanging around." 

As a result, fraternities were forced to 
obey liquo.r laws, or at least appear to obey 
them. A 1956 memo dictated, "either the 
fraternities will develop in more' WO(.th-
while ways than they have to dace . . . or 
they will turn within themselv.es and with-
er and die. Either alternative would be 
advantageous to the Yale community. To 
close them up on account of the bars would 
be ill-advised because the colleges them-
selves serve hard liquor." Rather than elim-
inate underage drinking, the enforcement 
ofliquor laws persuaded the administration 
co bring alcohol within the University's 
walls. 

With the alcohol question at least 
temporarily resolved, che administration 
was caught off-guard by che arrival of drugs 
on campus. In 1963, che administration was 
not prepared for the kind of public interest 
drugs would occasion. After Timothy Leary 
was arrested for passing out hallucinogens 
at Harvard, Yale invited a member of 
Leary's department, Michael Kahn, to join 
che Yale faculty. At Yale, Kahn lectured 
about the therapeutic uses for LSD and 
observed of Yale's attitude cowards drugs: 
"This is the Yale approach . . . cool, adult 
and scrupulous in its respect for academic 
freedom." 

Unforrunacely, 
the 
scace 
of 
Connecticut had a different concept of 
"cool" and "adult." Arrests rose, and police 
raided one Yale suite. As more Yalies land-
ed behind bars, some outraged students 
took notice. Future Deputy Secretary of 
State Strobe Talbott was first among them. 
Launching a personal crusade against che 
criminalization of marijuana in a 1967 issue 
of the Yak Daily News, Talbott wrote: 
"About one in four Yale students has 
smoked marijuana. It is a simple enough 
fact, but there are many ways of saying ic: 
You can say one in four Yale students has 
broken the law. . .. It is a bad law, but the 
city plans to enforce ic as though the 
American Way depended on ic .... The sit-
uation is going to be more and more a 
source of embarrassment to the University 
and mise!}' to the many students who use 
pot, until respected professionals--espe-
cially educational administrators, doctors, 
and lawyers--do all they can to get the law 
substantially changed or repealed." Strobe, 
we're still waiting.
