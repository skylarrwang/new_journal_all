T IS MID-MORNING IN THE CHILD PSYCHIATRIC WARD at Yale-New 
Haven Hospital, and 15 children sit around a table silently weav-
ing placemats. Each mat is constructed in a methodical way by 
methodical little fingers-three incisions in a piece of black card-
board, then red, green, and yellow strips of paper woven through. 
T he number of possible patterns is astronomical, but almost every 
child has settled on the same design-red strip, green strip, yellow 
strip, repeat. 15 sets of fingers loop in, through, out, and back in. 
There is Juan, who hears voices. There is Shaina, a veteran of 
numerous foster homes, who is prone to violence. There is Jamal, 
who is manic. There is Dana, who likes to fight. Hardly anyone 
talks, and the ward moves as one plodding unit-loop, loop, study, 
loop, loop, study. The plain lighting, the floor of congruent tiles, 
the blank television screen, and the circle of near silent, smiling 
nurses-at this moment, the ward is as simple and uniform as the 
white walls lining its interior. 

The scene is so uneventful that I leave and re-enter the room 
several rimes. There is no activity in the hallway. The bedrooms are 
empty. T he kitchen is quiet. The collective life-force of the ward, 
one of the most vital and progressive psychiatric institutions in the 
FEBRUARY 2003 
world, is concentrated on one table and 15 sets of working fingers. 
First a red strip, then a green strip, then a yellow strip. Repeat. 
Every room in the ward is situated along a straight hallway. 
There is a classroom with a chalkboard and desks arranged in rows. 
Down the hall is a common room with an area for eating and an 
area for watching television. Salmon-colored couches and chairs are 
arranged in a loose semi-circle around the TV. Light streams in 
through windows that overlook a small parking lot. Further down 
the hall, there are eight bedrooms arranged in alcoves, which are 
numbered so children can be called and dismissed in groups. To the 
right of the reception desk, there is a small room with padded walls 
where children are taken in moments of crisis. 

At the end of the main hallway, there is a gallery of children's 
art. The pictures are not the work of madness, but the scribbles of 
children, more happy-faced sun~ and dancing animals than omi-
nous dark. Yet there is something troubling about the work. O ne , 
picture depicts a tree, drawn in green and orange slashes, being 
overtaken by a wave. "The Storm of Life" is written above the water 
in block letters. One might almost attribute the piece to a fourth 
grader pushed to draw something sad. But the lines are too blatant,

T
HE CHILDREN AT YALE-NEW HAVEN 
are among the sickest any doctor will 
ever see. They suffer from a range of 
disorders that extends well beyond the 
usual psychological babble. "This is the 
deep end of the swimming pool," as Dr. 
Andres Martin, medical director of the 
ward, puts it. The list of conditions treated 
at Yale-New Haven is long and varied, and 
when multiplied across gender, age, body 
type, and background, it is formidable: 
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (oco), 
severe Attention Deficit Hyperactivity 
Disorder (ADHD), Oppositional Defiant 
Disorder, Conduct Disorder, depression, 
mania, autism, Post Traumatic Stress 
Disorder, Childhood Onset Schizophrenia. 
Because the ward at Yale-New Haven 
is a hospital, not a group home or clinic, it 
is able to accommodate children whose 
problems extend beyond the merely psychi-
atric. One girl named Robin, for example, 
was brought to the ward after undergoing a 
battery of physical tests. She was catatonic, 
and her doctors thought she might be 
1'2. 
suffering from encephalitis or epilepsy. 
When her tests came back inconclusive, 
Robin was admitted to the ward. Once 
there, she engaged in bizarre behavior, mas-
turbating publicly and humping doors. Dr. 
Martin and his team, perplexed, explored 
several possible explanations. Was she 
schizophrenic? Had she been abused? But 
when Robin became physically ill, these 
questions became irrelevant. She stopped 
swallowing. Her heartbeat grew irregular. 
New tests uncovered a deep-seated epilep-
tic focus in her brain. She was immediately 
given anti-seizure medication. Within days 
she was moving about on her own, but her 
mind was so addled she could not form 
new memories and had to be reminded of 
her actions and thoughts constantly. After 
living like this for a while, something raised 
her from the dead, and she slowly started to 
improve. By the time she left Yale-New 
Haven, she had regained 8o percent of her 
memory. She was keeping a journal and 
was expected to fully recover in time. 
Yale-New Haven dispenses every psy-
chotropic drug in the book. Stimulants.like 
Ritalin and Dexedrine are used to treat 
children with ADHD. Selective seratonin 
reuptake inhibitors like Prozac, Zoloft, 
Paxil, and Luvox are used to treat depres-
sion and anxiety. Mood stabilizers like 
Lithium and Depakote, among the 
most popular psychotropics in 
America, curb aggression and 
alleviate 
depression. 
Antipsychotics like Risperdal, 
Zyprexa, and Clozaril, an 
especially popular class of 
drugs in the ward, help soften 
aggression and psychotic symp-
toms like voices and visions. 
The liberal use of these med-
ications requires patience and know-
how, and the ward spends as much 
time detoxifying kids as giving 
them new drugs. "Kids will 
come here on six different med-
ications. . . . This is not sup-
ported by the medical liter-
ature," Dr. Martin told 
me. When children 
arrive at the ward, 
they 
are 
usually 
taken off of their 
old 
medications 
immediately. 
Once 
their systems are drug 
free, they are reassessed and their disorders 
are pinpointed. New medications are pre-
scribed, and progress is monitored. The 
process is slow and careful. Medicine is dis-
pensed at regular intervals, and every 
behavior from yawning to tantrums is 
noted in detail by counselors who spend 
every waking hour with the children. This 
system creates a highly controlled and sim-
ple environment, saturated with some of 
the strongest synthetics on the market. 

Most psychiatric wards, however, in 
no way resemble Yale-New Haven. If chil-
dren like Robin were not an exception and 
if drugs were universally handled in the 
way Yale--New Haven handles them, the 
story of child psychiatry would end right 
here. But the cost of such care is substan-
tial-almost $1,500 per child per day at 
Yale-New Haven, where the average child 
stays for 34 days-and over the last decade, 
hospitals around the country have been 
buckling under the financial burden. 

About half of the psychiatric beds for chil-
dren in Connecticut have been converted 
within the last four years. The only reason 
the Yale-New Haven ward is open is 
because the hospital is willing to lose 
money. Less renowned institutions are 
forced to close, and sick children are sent 
home. In the worst cases, the sickest are 
sent to adult mental hospitals; some stay 
for days in emergency wards, locked in 
rooms with minimal supervision. 

While caring for troubled children 
does not even approximate a money-mak-
ing venture, pharmaceutical companies 
have carved out a lucrative market in psy-
chotropics. In the last ten years, spending 
on in-patient care and out-patient clinics 
has dropped significantly, and spending on 
pharmaceuticals has skyrocketed. The sci-
ence of child psychopharmacology, howev-
er, is still in its infancy, and with pediatri-
cians prescribing more psychotropic drugs 
than ever, the field is getting sloppy when 
research has barely begun. Dr. Martin 
plainly acknowledges, "Drugs are cheaper 
than relationships." And drugs -do often 
work, in some cases very well. But health 
practitioners seem disturbingly eager to 
hasten their proliferation. As pharmaceuti-
cal companies storm the marketplace, 
many physicians wait with open arms, hop-
ing for a panacea that simply does not exist. 
Drugs have become the "quick fix" in a 
field where a quick fix may not be possible.
