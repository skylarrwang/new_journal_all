T
HE CHILD PSYCHIATRIC WARD at Yale-
New Haven serves two distinct pop-
ulations. Thomas Black, Patient 
Services Manager at the ward, describes the 
two groups that fill its beds as "children 
with families and children without them." 
At any one time, about half the ward con-
sists of children with stable families who 
communicate frequently with doctors, visit 
the ward, and ensure that treatment con-
tinues for their children afrer they leave the 
hospital. The rest of the children are in the 
custody of the Department of Children 
and Families (ocP) or Protective Services. 
These children are the most difficult to care 
for, and are usually in the hospital the 
longest since placement is hard to come by. 
Residential facilities and subacute hospi-
tals-which lack the resources ofYale-New 
Haven Hospital but will ofren accept kids 
after they have completed treatment 
there-are almost always full; the waiting 
period for a free bed can be as long as four 
months. Foster families, meanwhile, rarely 
take in older children. Often the failures of 
this larger system undermine treatment. 
Shaina is a small, plump girl with dark 
eyes and wiry black hair. A motherly 
eleven-year-old, she spends most of her free 
time caring for the only five-year-old in the 
ward. Today she fills a bucket with water 
and dish soap and invites the child, a little 
boy with curly black hair and stern eye-
brows, to splash with her. The play gees out 
of hand, and both end up wet and soapy. 
Since she was taken away from abusive 
parentS as a baby, Shaina has been shuttled 
from foster home to foster home. It is now 
late afternoon in the ward, and she sics with 
the older children in group therapy. Even 
here she is the mother hen, first facilitating 
a discussio~ on the unacceptibilicy of ward 
gossip before launching into a brief speech 
on her own tragic history. Shaina has lived 
in six foster homes and remembers only 
one good caretaker-an old woman who 
listened to her. She does not know where 
she will end up, and at eleven she is already 
too battered to be optimistic. 
I am sitting in the room, listening. In 
my backpack, I have a report on child psy-
chiatry in Connecticut, and as Shaina spec-
ulates as to what her fate will be, I map it 
out step-by-step based on the numbers. 
Shaina will likely leave Yale-New Haven 
much better. She .will be functional and 
vigorous. She will probably be transferred


to a residential facility, where she will live 
for six months to two years, and then be re-
filtered into the foster care system. Just like 
her previous caretakers, her new parentS 
will keep her for a while and then discard 
her. Many of them will be older women 
who lack the energy to care for children, 
and the problems that landed her in the 
psychiatric ward will likely return. Like 
most children in DCP custody-who are six 
times more likely than their peers living at 
home to be prescribed psychotropic med-
ication-Shaina will likely be put on a reg-
imen of pills. In the foster care system, 
these drugs serve a regulatory function. 
They keep children manageable, and that is 
exactly what Shaina will be. That is, until 
she has her next breakdown. 


J 
AMAL HAS A SMILE that very nearly 
stretches from ear to ear. He is the 
type of kid you grin at in public, a 
firecracker, giddy and round. He is also one 
of the sickest children Or. Martin has ever 
seen. To hear Jamal speak is to listen to a 
cassette tape in fast-forward-his words 
slur together in mono-syllabic bullet fire 
that is at best comprehensible and at worst 
"word salad," utter nonsense. Jamal is the 
most manic child ever treated at Yale-New 
Haven, and the first approved for 
Electroconvulsive Therapy. The procedure 
works by sending electric current through 
highly localized areas of the brain. It oper-
ates under the assumption that a manic 
mind will re-equilibrate when given a jolt. 
The treatment, however, does not seem to 
have worked on Jamal, who sics at the 
lunch table, downing chicken wings with-
out comment or breath. 
He bobs his head as he eatS and goes 
from manic grandiosity to pouty defiance 
without warning. He is a mess, and love-
able like an alcoholic, stinking of sickness 
but so human it makes the heart sink. 
When lunch is over, I find Jamal dancing 
oucside of his room. Nelly is blasting from 
his headphones. He crosses one foot over 
the other, spins, gives a quick pelvic thrust, 
and scrunches up his face in tribute to the 
music and his own genius. One therapist 
laughs and whispers to me, "He's been 
doing that dance since he was a little kid." 
Most of the children are in communi-
ty meeting, and everything is running 
smoothly. But then there is a problem in 
the hallway. A twelve-year-old boy has 


emerged from his room, angry and flailing. 
He is brought down .by two nurses, his 
head pinned to the ground, eyes wide and 
searching. He struggles at first, and then 
acquiesces, relaxing his body as the nurses 
pick him up and walk hi~ to the padded 
room. As soon as the door is shut, the boy 
begins to pound loudly and rhythmically. 
"You fucking bitches!" One beat every two 
seconds. 


Half an hour later I am standing in the 
bedroom of the boy who was restrained. 
His name is Tyrone, and he sits at his desk 
writing in a journal, face calm, hair cleanly 
buzzed. He is urban-cool, with baggy jeans, 
an oversized t-shirt, and immacu-
late tennis shoes. Far from a kid It iS 
troubles. Until this happens, he will remain 
trammg in psychopharmacology. This is 
a cool train-wreck.

Before lunch, the children line up sin-
denced by the sheer number of children 
gle-file. The meal is fried chicken, maca-
who show up at Yale-New Haven drugged 
roni, and green beans-a surprise, and 
out of their minds. It is easy for over-
everyone is excited. Some grumble about

their places by the supervising nurse. 


Last winter, a boy named Ryan was 
released from the ward at Yale New-Haven 
after a month of treatment. Ryan's prob-
lems began in preschool. His symptoms 
were elusive, and all the school could do 
was recommend he be evaluated by a psy-
chiatrist. His initial diagnosis was "neuro-
logical impairment," an ill-
easy for overworked doctors , defined disorder on the spectrum 
rocking in the corner, disheveled 
and aimless, Tyrone is the sort of 
boy you expect to find at a mall, 
picking up girls and high-fiving 
his buddies. He shakes my hand 
and shows me his writing, a sim-

symptoms-restlessness, 
un- . 
tability, short attention span. In 
second grade, he was put on 
Ritalin. He took poorly to the drug, which 
not only did nothing for his ADHD, but also 
seemed to adversely affect his psychological 
state. He began to roll his head and devel-
oped oco. He became increasingly para-
noid, convinced that other children were 
out to get him, and was unable to concen-
trate in school. He developed an arm flap 
and became agitated whenever anyone 
pointed at anything. He was prescribed 
Adderall, Paxil, and a handful of other 
drugs to no avail, and fmally announced to 
his father, "I have to go the hospital." By 
this time, his parentS had collected a box of 
forms, signed and compiled by pediatri-
cians, pharmacistS, neurologists, and psy-
chiatristS, and still, Ryan was sicker than 
ever. 


ple treatise on his own frustrations. Tyrone 
is a badass living among tattered little ·chil-
dren, and, for this reason, he is the most 
tragic character of all. 


It is unclear what is wrong with 
Tyrone. Dr. Martin and I stand in the main 
hallway, watching him through a window. 
He is working on a project, his head low-
ered in concentration. He might be psy-
chotic. He is frequently disorganized and 
has an imaginary friend, a surprising fact 
considering his age and personality. (His 
friend, Tyrone told Dr. Martin, moved to 
California when he entered the ward, and 
wears basketball jerseys and his hair in 
braids.) Or Tyrone might simply have pro-
cessing difficulties, a problem that Dr. 
Martin likens to a learning disability: "If 
you have a reading disorder, and I ask you 
to paraphrase a difficult passage, you may 
give me a nonsensical answer ... and I may 
wrongly conclude that you are psychotic." 
Perhaps Tyrone cannot process directives, 
and his oppositional nature has formed as a 
result. 


IfTyrone is diagnosed as psychotic, his 
treatment will follow a normal trajectory. 
He will be given an anti-psychotic like 
Risperdal. If his problems are purely cogni-
tive, like a learning disability, he will be 
treated with educational therapy. The path 
to recovery is long in either case, and only 
days in the hospital, following routine and 
being tested, will reveal the nature of his 


group, and no one seems to notice when 
one chilq returns and another leaves. This 
is routine--the nurse giving out the med-
ications knows each kid's name, condii:ion, 
and favorite color. When routine turns to 
free-time, Jamal runs to his room and starts 
dancing. 


I 
N TREATING CHILDREN LIKE SHAINA, 
Jamal, and Tyrone, the biggest danger is 
reducing them to abstractions. "I can't 
tell you how many times I have asked 
about a child at a medical conference and 
received a haiku presentation: 'Johnny is 
13, he has oco, he is taking Risperdal, 
Ritalin, and Prozac,'" Dr. Martin told me. 
This kind of "patient minimization" is not 
a new problem, but with the mass extinc-
tion of long-term psychiatric facilities and 
the new aggressive drug market, it is 
becoming increasingly acceptable. In a 
2001 report compiled by the the Child 
Health and Development Institute of 
Connecticut, Connecticut Department of 
Mental Health, and Yale Child Study 
Center, it was found that in 1998 and 1999, 
45 percent of all psychotropic presecrip-
tions for children on Medicaid were filled 
by primary care physicians. This is partly 
due to the shortage of mental health spe-
cialises in Connecticut, and partly a reflec-
tion of the times-the state's most compli-
cated children are being seen by pediatri-
cians with heavy case loads and no formal 


Ryan entered the ward at Yale-New 
Haven on Halloween, his favorite holiday, 
and was immediately taken off his medica-
tions. Drug-free, Ryan became increasingly 
paranoid and began to hear voices. One 
voice told him to saw off his own head, and 
another demanded he say "fuck you" to 
God. 


Bur eventually his _condition 
improved. A new antipsychotic, Risperdal, 
kicked in, and he was given Luvox to calm 
down and help with his compulsions. 
Within a month, Ryan was able to gradu-
ate to the hospital's partial program, con-
sisting of school and minimal day the.rapy. 
and was functional for the . first time in 
years. 


This is not to say that Ryan got better. 
Mental illness is not dimensional, and 
Ryan still has problems. After receiving the 
best care in the world, he is merely func-
tional, not free. Dr. Martin offers an over-
looked caveat when describing this sort of 
outcome: "What people don't realize is that 
we give these drugs to kids so they can 
function, so they can go back home and 
attend school. They are not cures." In some 
ways, Ryan's story represents the best of 
child psychiatry: He was so crippled he 
could not attend school and was turned 
around in just one month. But he also rep-
resents a darker side of the field: It took bad 
drugs, emerging psychoses, problems at 
school, problems at home, and a box full of 
forms to finally get Ryan where he needed 
to be. 


The 
uncommon 
denominator 
between Yale-New Haven and most of 
child psychiatry is not access to drugs or 
number of doctors-it is time. It is the 
plodding nature of the ward, its structured 
days and slow pace and the patient dedica-
tion of its staff. that is indispensibly thera-
peutic. Dr. Martin will spend a week study-
ing Tyrone before assigning him a diagno-
sis. He will test him and piece together his 
history. He will start him on a medication, 
go slowly at first, and then speed things up 
if the drug is a match. Tyrone will get bet-
ter because monotony and routine work. 
And this is why in-patient psychiatric 
wards can never become obsolete-they 
afford structure and coherence to the lives 
of children who are, by defmition, incoher-
ent. 


When I first visited the ward, I expect-
ed, at the risk of seeming voyeuristic, to see 
spectacular sights-schizophrenic rages, 
panicked 
back-room 
conversations 
between doctors and nurses. But what I 
saw could have been a scene &om any 
school in the country. Only slower. One 
kid got a little upset and had to be disci-
plined. Another was hyper. Children tried 
to push in line to get food. Kids talked 
about their problems. And for one hour, 
the children at Yale-New Haven worked 
meticulously on a craft in absolute uni-
son-just the kind of slow motion and 
monotony that makes the ultimate case for 
child psychiatry as something much more 
than chemistry.
