Dear Mrs. Nation: - As an ardent

authorities [including Claret Wind 
Punch, Cherry Wine Sauce, Apple 
Dumpling and Brandy Sauce, Roast 
Ham and Champagne Sauce, and 
Wine Jelly]. You will see how many 
of these dishes are served with

of the college authorities is nothing

had the audacity to say that "he thought 
the intoxicants were 'fruit juices,'" she later 
complained). So Nation indignantly 
returned to the mass of students waiting for 
her. She tried to deliver her speech again 
and again, but each rime she was greeted 
with the same response: a wild roar of song. 
Before she retreated, she allowed herself to
