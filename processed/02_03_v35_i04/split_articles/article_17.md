EHIND A PARKED TRACTOR on a race-
track in Queens, cwo men in raincoats 
squeeze the belly of a horse. The horse 
bucks, the jockey approaches, and the sta-
ble-hands pull the saddle strap around the 
horse. Above them the American flag waves 
in the snow-heavy sky, and the national 
anthem begins to play. 

340 people, who each paid $300 for 
the chance to compete in the richest and 
toughest gambling tournament outside of 
Las Vegas, are watching from an off-crack-
betting stadium (OTB) almost 8o miles 
away, in the outskirts of New Haven. The 
contestants rise for the anthem as it filters 
through the speakers high above. They 
stand between rows of white-clothed 
tables, their faces lifted towards the moving 
mosaic below the stadium's ceiling. It is 
there, on one of four giant television 
screens, that their horses are waiting to run 
at the racetrack in Queens. 

The contestants before us are gathered 
for Sports Haven's seventh annual National 
Handicapping Challenge. This is a contest 
becween some of the best gamblers in the 
country. It is a contest to determine who 
can best predict the future by looking at the 
past. They are waiting for the races to start, 
for the chance to show that they have mas-
tered a game in which everyone loses. They 
are studying the Daily Racing Form, they 
are gripping their lucky pens, they are cal-
culating the odds. 

The rules for the contestants are sim-
ple: place ten wagers on any ten horses over 
the course of cwo days. Whoever wins the 
most money on these ten will win the 
tournament, collect $40,000 in prize 
money, and find himself on an all expense 
paid trip to Las Vegas for a chance to com-
pete 
m 
the National Handicapping 
Championship. Everyone here today 
thinks he has discovered the secret to gam-
bling. Only one will walk out a winner. 

In Queens, the anthem has ended. 
The jockeys are mounting, the owners are 
perhaps praying, and the handicappers in 
New Haven are about to find out what it 
takes to win the game of chance.

ANDICAPPING CONTESTS, like this one 
at Sports Haven, have reached an 
unprecedented level of popularity in recent 
years. They are part of an ongoing prolifer-
ation of gambling venues across the coun-
try, a trend that began over 20 years ago 
when America placed its first wager. The 
wager was simple: legalize gambling, the 
ancient pastime of sin and vice, and hope 
for the best. In New Haven, the bet was 
placed early: In 1979, the city became the 
first in the country to build an OTB. 

On opening night," a crowd gathered 
in the parking 'lot of the towering stadium 
just off I-95· The doors opened to reveal a 
strange new world where wagers could be 
placed on horses running hundreds of 
miles away; where you could lose your last 
dime and be only a hop, skip, and a jump 
from a home-cooked dinner of mac and 
cheese. These first patrons were wined and 
dined on the top tier of the stadium, with 
musi~ and a feast. Thus began a ritual that 
for some gamblers has continued until this 
day. Some still park their cars in the same 
spots and cast their bets from the same 
tables. They come for the thrill of the 
game, the fine service, and the good com-
pany. 

On some scoreboards, this national 
wager 
has 
paid off. Thousands of 
Americans across the country gamble·every 
day and have a grand old time. In 1998, 
gambling grossed $50 billion, more than 
movies, theme parks, and the music indus-
try combined. Last year's champion of the

drove home with an enormous cardboard 
check for $40,000 in his backseat and woke 
up to his name in the paper. As the 
brochures at Spores Haven assure the 
novice gambler who wanders through its 
renovated doors, Racing is Fun! 

On ocher scoreboards-scoreboards 
that are not displayed in the casinos-the 
dice fall differently. A few years after chat 
first opening night, a father forgot his son 
in the new OTB in Norfolk. It became the 
big family joke: a little boy at the OTB all by 
himself with the gamblers. This little boy's 
father was a gambler. Every night at din-
nertime, his father would say, "We need 
milk. Milk and cookies." And then he 
would drive over co the store to pick up 
milk and .cookies. On the way, he'd stop at 
the phone booth, drop in a dime, and call 
his bookie to place a bet. The house had 
more milk and cookies than any ocher 
house on the block. 

Walk into any OTB in the country and 
chances are one of any four gamblers sitting 
at a cable watching the screens-perhaps 
the one who is snapping his fingers in cir-
cles and scamping his feet and shrieking 
"holy mother-of-god"-is there because he

can't say no to gambling. But then again, 
there is always the chance that he will mas-
ter the game.

HE FIRST TIME STUART "BEEP" Rubin, 
defending champion of the toughest 
handicapping tournament in che country, 
went co the racetracks, he fell in love. In 
1977 his father-"the best guy on earth, 
may he rest in peace"-took him co watch 
Seattle Slew win the triple final. The young 
Beef fell head over heels in love with the 
pageantry, the color, the ambiance of the 
races. But, as is sometimes the case with 
love, it took four or five brutal, painstaking 
years before he made sense of the game. 
Today, he has come back co win. He will 
use his mind and strategy co control the 
races that once almost controlled him. 

After the anthem has filtered through 
the broadcast system on this first morning 
of February, Beef pulls his gray beanie back 
over his shoulder-length curls and makes 
his way through the crowd. Beef is stocky 
and moves quickly. He carries with him a 
scotch, no ice. Around him, the darkened 
stadium is abuzz and swirling. Jazz muzak 
is falling from towering speakers. The 
Lakers are dancing and dribbling across a 
giant screen, looking down upon another 
screen on which dogs are chasing rabbits. 
The contestants are burying themselves in 
the Daily Form, under ringlets of smoke. 
Beef seems impervious to it all. 

Beef has set up an "office" from which 
he will implement his finely tuned plan to 
beat the odds. He has chosen the far-end of 
a table that faces a wall of mini-television 
screens. A placard of sorts marks his seat: a 
torn-out ad featuring a red slab of beef. 
Beef sics down at his desk and starts talking 
strategy. His face is damp with perspira-
tion. 

In the Bronx, Beef has another office 
from which he runs his second career as an 
Education Evaluator for the New York 
Department of Education. In that office, 
Beef once tried to hang a beautiful calendar 
of Churchill Downs. But he had to cake it 
down: Parents told his colleagues they did 
not want a gambler evaluating their chil-
dren. 

Here in his temporary office, nobody 
says anything about the beef ad. This is 
where Beef will take his expertise of statis-
tical analysis for evaluating children and 
apply it to evaluating horses. Beef's secret 
to gambling lies in the sprint-pace race--
