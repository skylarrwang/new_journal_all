A t three o'clock, on the day of what I was sure to be my death, 
,...,os was a hotbox of crowded flesh, gasoline fumes, oil palms, 
unseen microbes, and screaming children returning from a con-
crete-block school. Dust kicked up under feet and wheels, volatile 
molecules shuddered and rose from open sewers, sweat evaporated 
off the cuticles of plants and people, and all these particulates took 
communion in a heat-trapping screen above the city. Jos. Its name 
is an acronym for Jesus Our Savior--dubbed so by missionaries, the 
first Westerners to visit the town, which later became part of 
Nigeria's Plateau State. Since those first missionaries, many foreign-
ers have come to Jos. Lying in a bed at the Jos Government Clinic, 
I wondered how many of those foreigners had died. I kept asking 
myself, How did I get here? Where did I go wrong? 

The year before I entered medical school, I was studying 
Yoruba traditional healers in southwestern Nigeria. My research was 
to last ten months. Having traveled for long periods in the past, I 
understood the intensity of such a commitment abroad. To avert 
homesickness, I invited my father to visit me halfway ~.r;ough my 
stay. 

Upon his arrival, I showed him all around Yorubaland. Taking 
him both to tourist centers and the rural sites where I did my 
research, I gave him a full introduction to Yoruba culrure. I took 
him through the fetish markets of Ojo, where he saw the antelope 
skins with the mark of Ifa, the diviner-god. I brought him to 
University of Ile lfe for dances where they blared the Afro-pop of 
Lagbaja, Femi Kuti, and his great father Fela Kuti. I broke bread 
and drank palm wine with him and the witches of the Yoruba 
Kabbalah Center-an instirute that unifies Judaism with the 
Yoruba oro. I delivered him into the presence of Egungun, the 
beautiful and frightening festival of elaborately masked men, who 
were not men but gods. We also traveled to the North, an area with 
a lifestyle influenced more by the Sahara than by the tropics and 
with animist traditions influenced more by Islam than by 
Christianity. 

Learning the Peril 

On that trip to the North, things fell apart, slowly and irrevo-
cably. I woke on the morning of our flight with a high fever, joint 
pains, a pounding headache, and mild vertigo. I was sure I had 
malaria. On a previous excursion to West Africa, I had contracted 
the disease after refusing to take Lariam, the medical prophylactic 
of choice. I knew my relatively mild symptoms like an aura before 
an epileptic fit. 

Canceling the trip wasn't an option. Our tickets were non-
refundable, and our flight left m~ch too early for me co visit a doc-
tor and confirm my self-diagnosis. I could, however, self-medicate. 
Fighting my fever, I worked through my options. Chloroquine was 
the first treatment that came to mind. But Malaria folciparum, the 
most common strain of malaria in West Africa, had been develop-
ing a resistance to chloroquine for years. In any case, I bad left my 
only chloroquine stashed at my rural research site. All I had with me 
was a supply of Lariam. 

A 250 milligram dose of Lariam, taken once a week by mouth, 
has kept many travelers malaria-free for more than a decade. It 
seems easy-just swallow a little pill and you stay free of the para-
site. In reality; it's more onerous. It is not rare for Peace Corps 
Volunteers (Pcvs), diplomats, researchers, and others who take have 
taken Lariam to complain of upset stomachs, diarrhea, vision prob-
lems, headaches, and dizziness-symptoms strikingly similar to 
malaria itself-as well as strange dreams and a sense of having "not 
been right in the head." Locals often tell stories of PCVs that have 
"gone crazy" and who have been sent back home. I once heard a 
story of a PCV stationed in a small village of Akonsi in the Akwapim 
hills. He began to develop what the psychiatric community calls 
"ideas of reference" and "delusions of grandeur." He believed he was 
a holy man, sent by local gods to save the village. When the Peace 
Corps reps found him in the bush, he was screaming to the locals, 
"I am not a white man! I am a god! No, really, white men have acted 
as gods in the past. But I'm different. I AM a god. Really. I WILL save 
you. I have a plan, an elaborate plan for eco-tourism that .... " He 


;of Self-Medication 

went on and on. Of course, none of it was in Krobo, the local lan-
guage; the PCV hadn't been in Akonsi long enough to learn it. When 
I asked her, the man's Peace Corps replacement said the madness 
had been attributed by their doctors to Lariam and "a predisposi-
tion for psychosis." 

In me, Lariam's side effects had been mild, and in Nigeria I had 
faithfully taken Lariam once a week for the entirety of my stay. (The 
drug's 99 percent effectiveness should have made me suspicious of 
my self-diagnosis of malaria, but that fact seemed to slip my mind.) 
The side effects that I knew, however, were the result of one pill, the 
prophylactic dose--250 milligrams-to be metabolized over a 
whole week. The treatment dose, however, is five pills-1250 mil-
ligrams. If I took that much at once, I could very well go crazy. I 
argued to myself, I probably have a ton of residual Lariam circulat-
ing through my bloodstream already. My body seems to tolerate 
that well. What will a few more pills hurt? 

I took the pills. We flew to Jos. My malarial symptoms 
resolved. 

As my father and I wandered the streets and markets of]os, my 
world began to change. My headache, my vertigo, my joint pain, 
my fluctuating fever-they all returned with a fierceness that sur-
passed my previous definitively-diagnosed case of malaria. My sens-
es began to expand. The colors of the market seemed to rise from 
their surfaces. The din of the busy streets began to separate out into 
their components-the blare of a car horn, the sputter of a lorry's 
engine, the rumble of Hausa voices, the howl of a baby, the palpi-
tations of my own heart. The noonday heat worked its way into my 
skin. Ic became electricity, pushed aside my cells, worked its way 
into the interstitium of my consciousness. At first my heightened 
senses elated me. I thought it was the inherent awareness of being 
in a new place. Soon though, something told me it couldn't be just 
that. 

Three hours later, I was lying in the Jos Government Clinic. 
Though the peripheral blood smear at the clinic's lab showed no 
FEBRUARY 2003 
malarial parasites, I developed a fever-not a known side effect of 
Lariam. In an attempt to reduce the fever, I removed my shirt and 
khakis. All night, my father wiped down my skin with a wet cloth. 
On that bed in ]os Government Clinic, I wasn't a doctor. I wasn't 
my father's all-knowing guide. I was a boy who had swallowed a pill 
without thinking. 

My father was more frightened than I was. He asked me, 
"What if the lab is wrong? Isn't there just another pill-something 
different we can give you for the malaria?" "Yes, I could take chloro-
quine. But, if the lab's right, and all of this is drug-induced and not 
malaria, it could get worse. Lariarn and chloroquine are in the same 
drug family. Maybe chloroquine will just add to the damage." 

The next morning, my father and I flew back co Lagos. I was 
treated by both the American Embassy's physician and a hospital 
run by Israeli expatriates. Though the embassy's lab discovered one 
malaria parasite in my blood, neither the American nor the Israeli 
physicians could confirm that my debilitation had been caused by 
malaria. They felt that one parasite in a microscope's high-power 
field meant little and could easily be a lab error. None of the doc-
tors could make a definitive diagnosis. They could simply keep me 
hydrated, monitor my vitals, and control my fever. 

After a few days of being monitored at the Israeli hospital, I 
recovered. At the American Embassy's request, I flew home, under-
went a physical, and received a clean bill of health. 

A few weeks after my research in Nigeria was complete, I 
entered Yale Medical School. Now in my third year, I have recently 
completed rounds on a pediatrics ward, where on an out-patient 
basis doctors deal largely with seasonal colds. I've been struck by 
how often parents demand antibiotics for their sick children despite 
the warnings that the drugs do nothing for the common cold and 
ultimately make bacterial infections more difficult to combat. 

At first the parents' insistence frustrated me. One man refused 
to leave until his child was given "a shot or some pills or some-
thing." But I recall the temptation to abandon the protocols of evi-
dence-based medicine in favor of a quick fix. Is it hypocritical for 
me as a doctor-in-training to refuse my patients' demands for a pill, 
any pill, to stop painful symptoms when I learned first hand in 
Nigeria how strong the temptation to seize a simple solution can be? 
The answer is no, because I also learned in Yorubaland that to be a 
doctor is more than simply to be the guardian and dispenser of pre-
cious, omnipotent pills. It is to form the holiest of bonds--one 
based on the sustenance of life and health. Ic is a bond that could 
have saved me from my own mistakes and my near-death experi-
ence on that day in Jos.
