to anti-abortion groups like the Christian 
Medical Association and Focus on the 
Family. In the past, Hager has relied on 
religious beliefs to make medical deci-
sions, refusing birth control to unmarried 
women and recommending prayer to alle-
viate headaches and premenstrual syn-
drome. 
Jane was lucky. As a Yale University 
Health Services patient, she was able to 
take emergency contraception when she

needed it. With David Hager and others 
who share his ideology heading federal 
health advisory panels, however, it is cer-
tain that other women in N'ew Haven will 
not have the same option anytime soon-
an option that, if medicine and not politics 
were truly at stake, would not be left to 
luck.

A GOOD MANY COLLEGE FRESHMEN know 
(or at least secretly hope) that when they 
first ~et foot on campus, an oversized plas-
tic cup of warm keg beer is destined to find 
its way into their hands, despite any state 
law or university regulation to the contrary. 
Yale is no exception. At every party, the 
obligatory "you must be at least 21 years of 
age ... " appears above far less discriminat-
ing kegs. But if Yale's policy on underage 
drinking is baffiing now, it was no less so 
three centuries ago. 
In keeping with the puritanical spirit 
of the day, the laws of 18th century Yale 
prohibited everything from attending a 
play to ordering a "strong drink," including 
beer and wine. A student with alcohol in 
his room literally paid for his crime: He 
was fined the price of the bottle. Yet despite 
these seemingly rigid regulations, the Yale 
College dining hall had no qualms about 
serving hard cider to students at meals. The 
threat of typhoid fever made cider prefer-
able to water, which was believed to carry 
the disease. But deadly fever or no, the 
damage was done, and Yalies have been 
imbibing ever since. 
For lchabod Academicus, the comic 
book creation of WT. Peters, an 1848 Yale 
graduate, drinking alcohol marked a Yale 
man's coming of age. lchabod begins inno-
cent, ambitious, and arrogant. But his 
experience at college soon squashes these 
tendencies. He throws up after his first 
cigar, fails his first test, and feels generally 
down in the mouth. In time, he enters the 
ranks of mature Yale men: He joins a soci-
ety, drains pints at the local saloon, and still 
manages to earn high marks. In fewer than 
40 pages, lchabod embodies the college 
ideal. 
While Yale policy may have frowned 
upon the lchabods of past generations, cer-
tain administrators hardly stood in the way. 
In 1939, former University President 
Charles Seymour even went so f.u as to 
mock undergrads for preferring milk to 
beer. This public accusation was Seymour's 
way of recruiting more spirited applicants 
from the West coast. 
But times changed, laws stiffened, and 
administrators were forced to sober up. In 
the 1950s the state notified the University 
that underage drinking, particularly in fra-
