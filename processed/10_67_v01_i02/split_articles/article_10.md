Art 
In the West Gallery and corridor of the 
first floor in the Yale University Art 
Gallery, students and the general public 
have an opportunity to see a unique 
exhibition of sixty-seven works of art 
on loan to Yale from the Fogg Art 
Museum of Harvard University. This 
number comprises thirty-three paintings, 
twenty drawings and fourteen pieces of 
sculpture. Simultaneously, sixty-four 
works of art from the Yale collections 
are on loan to the Fogg Museum. 

These exchange exhibitions, the first 
between Yale and Harvard, originated 
in a conversation between the directors 
of the respective museums, Andrew C. 
Ritchie and John Coolidge, on ways in 
which a closer relationship could be 
brought about between the two institu-
tions. The resulting shows are a 
magnificent success. 

Neither exhibition can be called truly 
representative of the collections in each 
museum; for in choosing the works of 
art to send to the sister institution the 
directors were confronted with many 
problems. For example, many fine works 
could not be loaned because of the terms 
of bequests. Thus Yale was unable to 
lend any works by John Trumbull or 
Harvard to send any of their outstanding 
collection of Pre-Raphaelite paintings. 
Also, paintings on panels are considered 
too fragile to travel. 

In an exhibition such as the one now 
at Yale where every work is excellent, 
it is very difficult to choose the finest. 
I will attempt to list a few to which one 
should pay special attention. Among 
the paintings: the exquisite Head of 
Christ by Rembrandt; the Landscape by 
Bierstadt, which is an excellent example 
of the Hudson River School; the Poussin, 
Holy Family; Caracciola's St. Sebastian; 
the mysterious triptych, The Actors, 
by Max Beckmann; Bazille's Scene d'Ete, 
painted the year before his tragic early 
death and possibly his best work. 

The group of sculptures are also all of 
them excellent, but particularly impres-
sive are the Portrait of De Podenas by 
Daumier, the French Romanesque 
Capital with Scenes from the Story of 
Samson, the Angel Carrying a Cornu-
copia by Pierre Le P autre, Maillot's 
Young Cyclist, Gaspard Marsy's Boreas 
and Oreithyia, and Matisse's Le Serf.

**Letter from Berkeley**
**Author: John D. Elliott**

Letter from Berkeley 
Early on Friday morning, October 20, 
hundreds of University of California at 
Berkeley students joined many others in 
barricading the streets of downtown Oak-
land, not with their bodies, but with 
parked cars and trash cans which they 
pushed into the intersections around the 
Oakland Induction Center. They moved 
quickly, avoiding police and arrest as 
much as possible. 

And so, at the same time Mario Savio 
was serving the last week of his long jail 
sentence for leading the Free Speech 
Movement sit-in in 1964, the student 
protest movement emerged from the 
awkward transitional stage which has 
plagued it since the decline of the Civil 
Rights Movement. American students 
appear to have finally caught up with 
students in the rest of the world by 
abandoning their exclusive commitment 
to non-violent civil disobedience. 

This escalation of protest tactics was 
finally forced by the Oakland Police 
during the Tuesday morning "attack" 
on the induction center, the first of the 
two mass attempts to prevent or delay 
the transportation of inductees to and 
into the building during Stop the Draft 
Week. The slogan in the Bay Area was 
"Shut Down the Induction Center." 

Three thousand demonstrators on Tues-
day stood shoulder to shoulder before 
the induction center, filling an entire 
block of the street onto which the center 
opens. 

By no means unanimously willing to 
be arrested, most of the crowd intended 
to run if the 800 police moved in to 
make arrests; but the choice never came. 

Instead of attempting to arrest the 
protestors for refusing to disperse, the 
police charged the crowd at one end, 
clubbing them and spraying them with 
MACE, the new chemical immobilizer. 

Suddenly, the traditional non-violent 
sacrifice of going to jail was no longer 
available. Thus, a substanial minority 
of the 10,000 protestors from Berkeley, 
Stanford, San Francisco State and other 
schools who returned for the second 
"attack" on the following Friday were 
ready to be more aggressive and less self-
sacrificing in the face of the risk of 
serious injury. 

Dean Rusk had earlier this month 
signalled with embarrassing frankness 
the inevitability of the demise of peaceful 
protest tactics. Responding to a peace 
initiative placed on the San Francisco 
municipal ballot by the courts, after 
county supervisors had refused to do so, 
Rusk made clear that the Johnson 
Administration has no objections to 
such civil libertarian exercises, for it 
has no intention of altering its present 
Vietnam policy, no matter what the 
outcome of this vote and others like it. 

So much for lawful protest. 

dn the Berkeley campus, both pro-
testors and administrators sought to 
avoid an on-campus Free Speech conflict. 
With unprecedented liberality and 
courage, Berkeley Chancellor Roger 
Heyns stood up to conservative civic 
pressure and granted students permission 
to use a campus building for a teach-in 
the Monday night before the week's first 
descent upon the Oakland center. But, 
in a grossly political decision of doubtful 
constitutionality, an Oakland judge 
ordered Heyns to deny the protest use 
of campus facilities; and Heyns has since 
cited almost 100 students for participat-
ing in "illegal" rallies on campus. 

Students, nevertheless, have not yet 
sought to protest Heyns' action because 
they are unwilling to divert their energies 
from attacking the War and draft to 
defending the civil liberties necessary 
to protest.
