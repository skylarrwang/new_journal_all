Death at an Early Age: 
Report from 
the Graduate School 

By Michael Lerner

"My ima.ge of graduate school is of a 
long period of semi-consciousness ... 
of a state approaching death," a second-
year graduate student in history told 
me when I had been at the Graduate 
School three days.


The first lecture I heard was on 
Aristotle's Politics. At the end of the 
hour the professor asked for questions. 
The only question was: "How far do 
you expect us to be in the Politics next 
week, sir?"


The professor stroked his busby black 
beard. "You know that's the whole 
problem. You ask what you are expected 
to do, and I can't blame you. You've got 
the pressure of a dozen other assign-
ments. You can't read the Politics that 
way. You should be able to read it and 
think about it, and then follow up a 
passage that interests you, or a theme 
you think runs through it, in half a 
dozen other books. I know if I don't 
assign you anything, if I leave you to do 
what you want, half of you won't do 
anything. And you know, I'm beginning 
not to give a damn."


That teacher, who managed to touch 
some students, left Yale. In political 
science, philosophy, psychology, and 
history-to name only the cases I know 
of-teachers who were able to excite 
their students about learning have failed 
to meet the criteria of their departments. 
They were not "solid" enough or bad 
not published enough or had published 
the wrong things.


Most graduate students accept these 
dismissals as they accept the other 
indignities foisted on them in the name 
of academic procedure. They accept 
because their capacity for critical think-
ing has been channelled into snippy 
commentaries on some aspect of The 
Literature in their discipline.


Because there is no freely critical 
group of students and faculty the 
Graduate School has fallen into the 
patterns afflicting graduate education 
across the country. Like the graduate 
schools of less fortunate universities, it 
bas become a knowledge factory proces-
sing students who roll down a conveyor 
belt past work stations where professors 
screw on their specialized irrelevancies. 
The quality control at the end of the belt 
is purely a test of whether the chrome 
is well secured, before Yale gives its 
prestigious 500,000 words or seven years 
(whichever comes first) warranty.


By letting the Graduate School drift 
into what it bas become, letting it do what 
it does to graduate students, Yale is 
failing the students and society. The 
students are pressed into truncated molds 
that leave little room for their develop-
ment as individuals or as teachers. The 
society which supports the Graduate 
School is deprived of a fair return on its 
investment.


What follows are sketches, from the 
limited perspective of a graduate student 
in the political science department, of 
some of the shortcomings in graduate 
school life. What is wrong with the 
formal training the school offers? What 
is wrong with the life its students lead? 
What is wrong with the relationship 
between those students--social scientists
