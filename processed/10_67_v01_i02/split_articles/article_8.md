To the Editors: 
I think that few students who have 
suffered through classes in Winchester 
and North Sheffield, who put up with 
the noise and poor lighting, who stifled 
during the summer and froze during the 
winter, are actually sorry to see those 
"fabulous manifestations of man's 
humanity" bite the dust. We should not 
be deceived by Mr. Scully's sentimental 
rhetoric into thinking highly of these 
buildings. They were ugly, monstrous, 
depressing structures--examples of 
Victorian bastard architecture at its 
very worst. Those who regret the build-
ings value age, not aesthetics. We should 
be happy to see such rubbish destroyed-
the Old Campus should surely be next.

The Myth is no more: New Haven is 
not a "model, slumless city," filled with 
euphoric, prosperous citizens. The dis-
turbances during August buried the 
myth,thankfully and at long last. 

Yet, disturbingly, the summer dis-
turbances in New Haven, while destroy-
ing one myth, appear to have given rise 
to another: that Mayor Lee's urban 
renewal program has been primarily 
concerned with catering to the upper-
classes of the city, to the exclusion of 
the ghettoes; and that the troubles this 
summer were an inevitable result of this 
misplaced emphasis. 

John Wilhelm, in his lengthy article, 
"The Success and Tragedy of Richard 
C. Lee" (The New Journal: October 15, 
1967), carries this new view much 
further. According to Wilhelm, Mayor 
Lee's program is an outgrowth of an 
alliance between big business in New 
Haven, the banks and Yale. The major 
objective of their support is selfish: for 
big business, to make money; for Yale, to 
provide a prettier environment for the 
protection of its upper-class, Ivy League 
population. 

But, according to Wilhelm, there is a 
more insidious motive behind the 
alliance: to protect the power structure 
from any unwanted infiltration from the 
ranks of the poor and, inferentially 
and more specifically, the blacks. To 
use his words: "In ... (Mayor Lee's) 
administration, the only disagreement 
tolerated is from those who already have 
significant power. The voices of the 
protesting poor are shunted aside as 
quickly as possible." 

Like many myths, the newest one 
about the causes of the disturbances this 
summer, even carried to the extreme 
of the Wilhelm thesis, has a core of 
truth. But in order to isolate this core 
and appreciate its meaning, it is neces-
~ 
to put the allegations which gave 
nse to the myth to closest scrutiny. 

With such an approach, one finds most 
of Mr. Wilhelm's accusations and 
hypotheses unable to stand up to either 
fact or logic. 

There are two specific instances of 
error in fact by Mr. Wilhelm which, 
~though apparently trivial, portend a 
1~lar tendency for inaccuracy and 
dtstortion on more iro'pOrtant topics. 

The first involves the FBI. In preparing 
the reader for his general thesis of 
Mayor Lee in alliance with the forces 
of reaction and money, Wilhelm, in his 
"Introduction," accuses "the liberal 
Lee" of ''working with that most con-
servative of governmental institutions, 
the FBI." The purpose of Mayor Lee's 
newly formed partnership with J. Edgar 
Hoover's men, according to Wilhelm, is 
to get Fred Harris and other black 
militant leaders put behind bars. This 
little story makes good reading; un-
fortunately, it has no relation to reality. 

In fact, when the FBI called on Mayor 
Lee, he gave them no "help" or "en-
couragement" other than directing them 
to the files of the Police Department 
which are, of course, open to the public. 
That was the extent of his dealing with 
the ;FBI. 

The second instance is more blatant 
and more serious. Wilhelm accuses 
Mayor Lee of breaking a "series of 
agreements" made on Sunday, the second 
day of the rioting. We are to infer that 
these "agreements" involved allowing 
the black militants to stop the violence 
without any intrusion from the police. 

First of all, no such agreements were 
ever made; they were admittedly de-
manded by Fred Harris and leaders of 
the Hill Parents Association, but never 
agreed to by anyone from the Mayor's 
staff, much less by the Mayor himself. 

Mayor Lee did exhibit some restraint in 
sending police into the Hill section 
during the initial hours of the dis-
turbances; but this was of his own 
volition. It is easy to understand how 
Mr. Wilhelm came to his "broken 
promise" conclusion. The well-publicized 
demands of Fred Harris to send the 
police out of the Hill turned to bitterness 
when the demands were ignored. It was 
an easy logical step to then assume that 
the demands were not ignored but rather, 
accepted and then disregarded with bad 
faith. In point of fact, however, the 
latter is completely untrue. 

Parenthetically, although the dis-
turbances themselves presented a 
tremendous emotional shock to New 
Haven residents and to the national 
press, the amount of resident participa-
tion and the extent of damage was 
quite slight, particularly when compared 
to similar disturbances in other cities. 

There were no casualties, no shots fired, 
no widespread looting or burning. This 
is not to minimize the significance of 
the disturbances, nor the degree of 
discontent in the ghetto which in large 
part gave rise to them. Nor would most 
city officials deny that there were many 
instances of false arrest and police 
brutality during those tumultuous August 
nights. Still, New Haven was no Newark 
or Detroit; far from it. Some in New 
Haven credit this to the Mayor's quick 
action in imposing a curfew and increas-
ing the police detail in the troubled areas. 

This is surely one pertinent explanation. 

But, to seek a more relevant explanation, 
we must take a close look at what 
Mayor Lee has sought and accomplished 
over the past fourteen years. Hopefully, 
in doing so, we can at the same time 
dispose of Mr. Wilhelm's thesis and the 
myth formulated by Mayor Lee's newest 
critics. 

One of the most oft-repeated aspects 
of the myth, repeated to the point where 
it now seems thought of as doctrine 
among the Mayor's critics, goes some-
thing like this: Mayor Lee's urban 
renewal program is geared for the upper 
and middle classes; to prove this, an 
impressive array of luxury housing and 
business revitalization and construction, 
done during the Lee years, is listed. 

It follows then, that Mayor Lee's urban 
renewal has been no more than· Negro 
removal; that the bulldozer has outdone 
the builder; and that displaced families 
are left without adequate homes to move 
to and without aid from the city admin-
istration. That is the theory. Now, with 
objectivity, let us look at the facts. 

Over the past decade, New Haven, 
under its urban renewal program, has 
built, is building, or is planning to build 
5,100 housing units. In addition, over 
9,000 dwelling units have been re-
habilitated with the city's encourage-
ment, at a private investment of more 
than $17 million. The latter figure does 
not include more than $2 million worth 
of rehabilitation done through the city's 
housing code enforcement agency. Of 
the 5,100 new units, almost one-half are 
for low-income groups; less than one-
fifth are upper-middle or upper-income 
units. This percentage of low-income 
housing is higher than urban renewal 
programs of any other city in the nation. 

Plans continue to be made for further 
low-income developments through vari-
ous unique approaches, some of which 
will be discussed below. Noted architect 
Louis Kahn is working on preliininary 
plans for the Hill project, budgeted at 
$14 million, most of which will go to the 
construction of low-income housing, 
two new schools and recreational 
facilities for the residents of the Hill. 

What about the families who lie in 
the path of the bulldozer? First of aU, 
the Lee administration makes every 
effort to locate non-residential plots of 
land upon which new housing can be 
built. Anyone who has taken the briefest 
ride through the Dixwell or Dwight 
projects will notice, almost invariably, 
empty lots with signs in front announcing 
a new Redevelopment Agency project. 

But, in cases where families are Jiving 
on the site of a prospective project, the 
Lee administration has provided them 
with a unique means of finding satisfac-
tory housing elsewhere: the Family 
Relocation Office. 

Although the Family Relocation Office 
is only required to find other residences 
for families affected by a New Haven 
urban renewal project, it very rarely if 
ever turns anyone away who is looking 
for another home. Mr. Wilhelm men-
tioned the many families who are being 
forced to move because of the Route 
34 extension. But Mr. Wilhelm neglects 
to add that this is a state highway project, 
for which the New Haven Relocation 
Office has no responsibility; he also 
neglects to add that notwithstanding its 
theoretical lack of responsibility, the 
Office took on the job of helping to find 
adequate homes for families forced to 
relocate because of Route 34. 

Mr. Wilhelm spends a good deal of 
time alleging that urban renewal in New 
Haven is profit motivated. This fits in 
nicely with his thesis, reminiscent of the · 
Populist era, that the Big Money of New 
Haven, encouraged by Mayor Lee, has 
supported urban renewal only to make 
a profit. For example, revitalization of 
the downtown district, according to 
Wilhelm, was "ultimately more profit-
able" for business than "fleeing to the 
suburbs." 

In this instance, Mr. Wilhelm is cor-
rect. His assertion, however, that such 
a situation is bad is not necessarily 
correct. Cities across the nation have 
been stymied in their attempts to improve 
urban conditions because of a dearth 
of municipal revenue. As slum conditions 
increase, real estate assessments go down, 
more and more people move to the 
suburbs, the tax base continues to shrink, 
and less and less business, banking and 
real estate investors are willing to 
gamble with a major financial invest-
ment in the city. 


One of the keys to Mayor Lee's 
astounding success and national reputa-
tion has been his ability to break this 
vicious circle. He has convinced local 
businessmen that investment in New 
Haven is a good investment; he has lured 
numerous national firms, such as 
Sargent's, and Macy's, to New Haven, 
convincing them that the city is a good 
place for them to locate; he has, most 
of all, convinced banks and real estate 
firms that investment in new housing 
can be profitable. The results of his 
efforts have been a meteoric rise of tax 
revenue over the past ten years, the 
opposite of what is happening in most 
cities. For example, in 1957, the Oak 
Street Project area (bordering and in-
cluding where the Connector now is) 
was assessed at $1.4 million. Today, it is 
assessed at more than $18.5. Robert 
Kennedy's recent proposal about offering 
businessmen tax incentives to invest in 
the ghettoes operates under the same 
principle: make slum investment profit-
able, and private enterprise will join in 
the task of slum-clearance full force. 

This is not to say that Mayor Lee 
supports only those urban renewal pro-
grams which are profitable for big 
business, an assertion which Mr. Wilhelm 
makes. It is, in fact, up to Congress to 
take the profit motive out of urban 
renewal through increased federal aid, 
rent supplement programs, and the like. 

But until such a total federal commitment 
is made-and it does not appear forth-
coming-Mayor Lee will remain willing 
to use whatever means necessary to im-
prove housing conditions in the city. 

Hurry, hurry, hurry! 

Such pragmatism is loathsome to ideolo-
gical idealists; but, in New Haven, at 
least, it has been effective. 

Finally, Mr. Wilhelm is highly critical 
of CPI and its programs. Again, the 
conspiracy theory of the money powers 
emerges: "CPI ... is a coalition of those 
in the community who already have 
power ... implicit in their programs is 
the assumption that the poor are where 
they are because something is wrong with 
them, whether it be lack of education, 
poor motivation, or something else." 

Mr. Wilhelm quotes one black CPI 
worker-just one-to support this broad, 
damning generalization. 

One could counter this charge with 
an endless recital of black CPI workers, 
as well as whites, who would utterly 
deny that such an assumption exists; 
one could also cite an endless list of 
CPI programs for job training, educa-
tion, family counseling and recreation 
which were and continue to be models 
for the federal Poverty Program to 
imitate. 

However, within this exaggerated and 
unsupported generalization, Mr. Wilhelm 
has hit upon an important truth: the 
trouble with many of the CPI programs 
over the past six years (and, equally so, 
with the Poverty Program over the 
past three years) has been the lack of 
full participation and direction of these 
programs by the underprivileged them-
selves. This is not, however, the result 
of a sinister conspiracy by the "haves" 
against the "have-nots." Rather, it is a 
result of the newness of the Poverty 
Program concept itself. 

It has been only recently that CPI has 
learned the importance and value of 
having neighborhood residents them-
selves organize and plan their own 
programs. Mr. Wilhelm lightly passes 
over a $45,000 grant given to the Hill 
Parents Association by CPI (and for 
which the Mayor was largely responsible) 
for their own programs. The money was 
given with few strings attached; HPA 
was allowed to use it as it wished. Just 
recently, in the first week of October, 
CPI announced that $300,000 would be 
similarly available for neighborhood 
residents to use for their own programs. 

Of course, Mr. Wilhelm's rejoinder 
might be that this is too little, too late. 

Nevertheless, it is a start. CPI began in 
1961, two years before a Poverty 
Program was even discussed in Wash-
ington. In six years, it has come a long 
way. 

Perhaps the best insight into Richard 
C. Lee, the man, and the difference 
between Richard Lee, the Mayor, and 
other mayors in this nation, can be seen 
by his initial reaction to the summer 
disturbances. 

There were many people in New 
Haven who spoke of "their" ingratitude 
for all Mayor Lee had done for "them"; 
others explained away the disturbances, 
as countless Mayors of other cities 
repeatedly did throughout the summer, 
as the work of "outside infiltrators" or 
the "criminal" element. 

Mayor Lee, however, felt and said 
none of these things. The first person 
at whom he pointed an accusing finger 
was himself. "This only goes to show 
that for all this administration has tried 
to do for this city, it has only scratched 
the surface. For every three steps 
forward we've taken, there have been 
four steps back. Perhaps these dis-
turbances will wake people up to the 
seriousness of the urban crisis, the com-
plexity of the problems, the difficulty of 
the challenge which faces us. God knows 
we've tried to alleviate some of these 
problems. Now, we must work all the 
harder." 

Lee's genius lies not in his ability to 
avoid mistakes but in his ready willing-
ness to learn from them. He is the 
eternal pragmatist, constantly experi-
menting, looking for new ways to build 
housing, new ways to get federal money, 
new ways to teach skills to the poor. 

Yet, Richard Lee's pragmatism has 
not led to cynicism. His willingness to 
yield to practical realities is tempered by 
a continued idealism, a confidence in 
the efficacy of affirmative government 
action. His dream of a "slurnless" city 
remains undaunted, despite the setbacks 
of the past; his intuitive optimism and 
faith in the ability of the rich and the 
poor to work together remain unbroken.
