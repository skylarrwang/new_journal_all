in the case I look at-and the surround-
ing society? 

When you ask graduate students if 
they like what they are doing few say yes 
with enthusiasm. The majority appear 
resigned, apathetic, and faintly depressed 
by the content of their training. "I look 
at graduate school as a five-year chore 
I have to do to get my union card," a 
student from the Midwest said. "Then 
I hope I can say screw the whole 
system. But it's as though they were 
after you all the time. It's hard not 
to get sucked in." 

Some students have suggestions for 
change. A large number do not want to 
question what and how they are taught. 
"I'm not an activist," a girl from New 
Jersey shrugged. "I want to go through 
here and that's it." 

The apathy in part is a character trait 
of the kind of people attracted to the 
socially marginal, secure, increasingly 
remunerative life of a tenured professor. 
It is reinforced, however, by the training 
students receive at the Graduate School. 
Students often begin their graduate ap-
prenticeship with enthusiasm about 
working on the edges of knowledge in 
their field. When they are handed half 
a dozen bibliographies and recognize 
anew the patterns that put them to sleep 
as undergraduates, the enthusiasm rarely 
lasts. 

They acquire the academic vocabulary 
of their department which usually be-
comes a sloppy disguise for simple 
thoughts. 

They learn what it is they will actually 
need to know. A political science 
student, for instance, needs a crude 
notion of the theories of ten or fifteen 
men who presently enjoy a reputation at 
Yale. There is no point immersing one-
self in the thinking of one man because 
you will only be able to talk about him 
for one hour, at the most, on general 
examinations. 

What the Graduate School really 
fosters in its students is a sort of Time 
magazine approach to knowledge: 
Establishment-biased outlines of any 
subject in the field studded with vivid bits 
of detail that hint at vast memorized 
resources. 

These values are reflected in the 
admiration students reserve for profes-
sors with prodigious memories for every-
thing written in their specialty. The 
capacity to refer to every relevant article 
in The Literature is certainly useful. But 
it helps the professor avoid thoughtful 
response to the question a student asks. 
Nonetheless the student is impressed 
when the professor refers him to six 
articles related to his question and cites 
the review, volume number, year, and 
page references from memory. How 
easily academics forget the marginality 
of this cramming for creative thinking. 
Hobbes once said if be had read as many 
books as one of his contemporaries be 
would have been as great a fool. Too 
frequently in graduate school the pos-
session of a Polaroid mind marks a man 
for tenure. 

Whether or not the student remembers 
what he reads, the force feeding has a 
devastating effect on his capacity to react. 
When be is asked to read a book, an 
article presenting a counter-thesis, and 
a critique of the counter-thesis his own 
critical faculties are often numbed. 

Because of the incredible explosion in 
the number of books and articles and 
new periodicals appearing each year, the 
task of trying to master a field grows 
more time-consuming, anxiety-provok-
ing, and impractical. Yale has failed to 
consider how this explosion affects the 
scholarly goals it sets graduate students. 

Work has been done on setting up 
information-retrieval systems, but the 
problem of reorienting the student and 
examining how much he can handle 
fruitfully and how he should use his time 
has not been faced here head-on. 

Instead of facing this difficult issue the 
Graduate School seems content to slide 
along, pushing more and more informa-
tion at the students, adjusting only (and 
barely) the examinations to the reality 
of what a student can absorb. Few people 
are thinking concentratedly about the 
consequence of this drift for the students' 
creativity and for the kind of total lives 
graduate students live while they are 
at Yale. 

The graduate student is not materially 
pathetic. He survives well on his fellow-
ship--though this is not the case, for 
example, in the Drama School-and be 
is headed for a career which offers 
travelling grants, sabbaticals, long vaca-
tions, decent pay, and extraordinary 
security once he has tenure. 

Graduate students are impoverished 
in a more personal sense. 

Get up in the morning, read the New 
York Times. Go to the library and read 
or worry about not reading. Go to one or 
two seminars. Go home and read Time 
or Newsweek. Have dinner and read, 
or worry about not reading. At 9:30 go 
to the movie, then go home and study. 

The graduate student is deprived by 
his life style of the use of his senses. He 
is encouraged to adopt a psychic stance 
that allows for few human commitments 
and direct emotions. His time drains 
into endless and usually fruitless read-
ing, mile after mile of the printed line. 

One forgets what an unreal world 
the graduate student inhabits. He is a 
pathfinder or pathseeker in a countryside 
where the landmarks are not ridges or 
trees-not even people and real events-
but key articles in The Literature. 

He rarely fights to influence what his 
country does to itself or the world. The 
human intercourse he knows best is the 
perverse interaction between defensive 
and often ino;ecure men that ~es place 
around a seminar table. 

He rarely works on the Hill or with 
children or for Mayor Lee. He is actually 
suspect if he writes plain English for a 
mass circulation publication to tell 
people what he has learned in his years 
of study-although later this may be 
regarded as an acceptable eccentricity if 
he first establishes himself as a great man 
within his discipline. 

There are exceptions-students work-
ing in Students for a Democratic Society, 
Upward Bound, or one of the more con-
servative community service organiza-
tions. 

But most students shrink from com-
mitting time to the community because 
they feel they are robbing it from their 
reading. They spend free time furtively-
m front of a television or at the movies. 
So they complete the cycle by ensuring 
that all contact with the outside world 
is mediated. It is a thoroughly second-
hand life, and the institution that shapes 
it-Yale Graduate School with its re-
quirements and pressures--shares 
responsibility with the graduate students 
for what it is.

5 I The New Journal! October 29, 1967 
One of the strongest pressures toward 
passivity results from the structure of 
relationships graduate school imposes on 
its inmates. 

Professors call us Mister X and we 
call them Mister too. But we say Mister 
with a different inflection. If they know 
us well they call us John or George. 
If we know them well we call them 
Mister. But they call each other by their 
first names and we call each other by 
our first names so behind the Misters at 
the seminar table are modes of behavior 
unchanged since grade school. 

If a professor three years older than 
you is foolish in class you cannot point 
that out to him. He can indicate your 
failings to you. This may be natural with 
a teacher fifty years old and a student 
who is fifteen. But what of a professor 
who is thirty and a "boy" who is twenty-
six? The appellations are just a symptom: 
the true problem is the continuation of 
grade-school relationships years past 
the point where they are appropriate. 

This training in dependency bolsters 
a deference to authority in graduate 
students that does not easily coexist with 
the capacity to make vigorous social 
criticism. 

We get used to--in fact we learn to 
thrive in and only in-the boundaries 
of these relationships. Then as we are 
assigned the status of teacher we find 
students assuming deferential attitudes 
toward us, and we assume the teacher's 
role. 

The best teachers break through these 
forms and talk to a student as one man 
to another. The only deference comes 
from a desire to hear a man who has 
something to say. But this requires effort 
from both teacher and student. Rarely 
do these efforts meet. 

So teaching becomes the observance of 
forms: you are a professor, then \each 
me. You talk and I listen. I know I have 
to learn what you say, you know you 
have to say something. By what magic 
does a graduate student who has listened 
endlessly to men and books, expected to 
reject nothing (he may be tested on 
anything), become a professor with 
something to share with his students? 
Not by the training be undergoes in 
graduate school. 

It would be conceit to believe the 
quality of a graduate student's life is 
the crucial failing of the Yale Graduate 
School. The graduate student lives 
better in every sense than the majority 
of New Haven residents. The real ques-
tion is what the Graduate School con-
tributes to changing-this ugly state of 
affairs in the city and in the nation. 

The answer, it seems to me, is that 
v.JeGraduate School makes shockingly 
little contribution to any community, 
whether local or national, and that part 
of the reason is that graduate students 
~xperience so little of what participation 
m a community means. 

Yale lacks community for graduate 
students even in the minimal sense that 
~arvard (or the city of Cambridge) with 
•ts heterosexually more balanced and 
~ially more fluid population provides 
•t. The failure of communications be-
tween graduate students in different 
ingrown departments at Yale is 
astounding. 

As an example, political scientists 
room together, go to parties together, 
eat together, quote Almond and Verba 
(a text) to each other. Their jokes are 
pitiful attempts to relate their technical 
vocabularies to everyday experiences-
and in the attempt lies the humor. 

Friendships and parties much more 
rarely cross departmental lines than at 
many other universities-partly because 
of the absence of girls, partly because 
Yale has no meeting places such as a 
congenial coffee house or bar where 
graduate students draw together. 

The impoverished inner community 
means students have few opportunities 
to begin, in little ways, to organize in 
order to influence the surroundings that 
shape their lives. Many graduates of 
course recapture in later life the capacity 
of integrating their academic and social 
lives. But in far too many cases the habit 
of inactivity does lasting damage. 

There are a few signs of stirring. Grad-
uate students in history are concerned 
about the reasons Staughton Lynd did 
not get tenure and have organized a ma-
ture petition for inquiry. Students for a 
Democratic Society has organized anew 
with new life. 

But SDS is not predominantly oriented 
toward university reform, much less 
graduate school reform. And the specific-
issue oriented organizations rarely reach 
beyond the boundaries of one depart-
ment. 

Yet there are reforms that should be 
made at Yale Graduate School which 
will probably not be made unless the 
graduate community discovers and then 
voices common interests in organized 
fashion. 

The most socially urgent reform is 
needed in the social sciences. Advanced 
students of society at Yale do little to 
make the country they study a better 
place to live. That should be their highest 
calling, really. They barely consider it 
a calling at all. Social progress in con-
crete terms seems to be conceived of as 
a "spin-off" from social science, just as 
a new color television tube is usually 
spin-off from military or space research. 

Action-oriented college graduates go 
to the law schools, not the graduate 
schools. The double presumption is that 
Jaw school will at least teach them how 
to get things done while social sciences 
will offer few indications of what is 
worth doing. 

The potential value of some social 
science research to the action-oriented is 
substantial. Hidden in the political 
science literature alone are the empirical 
groundings for suggestions about 
electoral reform, urban government. 
decision-making rationality and many 
other things. But since these books so 
frequently refer to views and problems 
of The Literature, their practical con-
sequences must often be inferred. And 
even these suggestions are hidden from 
all but the initiate. 

Why is The Literature itself not aimed 
more directly at social problems? Why 
does effecting their solution appear so 
marginal to most of the work in social 
science? This seems partly a consequence 
of the reward structure that has evolved 
in the social sciences at Yale and that 
Yale now tolerates. 

Students enter graduatQ training in 
political science, for example, expecting 
careers either in academics or as gov-
ernment technicians. Their choice of 
courses and dissertations as well as their 
habits of thinking is influenced by their 
anxieties for success in the career line 
they choose. 

If they want to succeed in the educa-
tion industry they should choose 
expanding fields, work with influential 
professors whose esteem is essential to 
fellowships and teaching jobs, and write 
a dissertation that will become an 
academically respectable first book. 

If they want to be government 
technicians they need courses in areas 
where Washington needs experts-on 
Africa, Asia, urban problems, and 
defense. They should work under pro-
fessors with Washington connections, 
spend their summers in government jobs, 
and-above all-write their dissertations 
on "tough-minded" and politically 
respectable topics. 

The trouble is that the problems this 
country needs to solve are neither 
academically neat nor politically 
respectable. 

They fall into a no-man's land: too 
large, controversial, and methodolog-
ically unmanageable for the ambitious 
academic; too risky for the ambitious 
technician. 

These problems are left for the 
academically untrained and naive to 
confront, which hardly means they will 
be handled better. For although the 
analysis of American pathologies may 
strain a social scientist's tools up to and 
past the breaking point, he is still better 
equipped to deal with their difficulties 
than people who do not see the difficulties 
clearly. 

The problem is to transfer the pseudo-
objectivity born of fear of involvement 
back to the area of the analysis where 
true social objectivity belongs. Then the 
social scientist needs the courage to make 
explicit and to publicize the conse-
quences his analysis suggests. 

The case of the social sciences-in 
which reorganization of concerns and re-
wards is so pressing-is only one ex-
ample of an area where students at Yale 
Graduate School could change things if 
they involved themselves in their educa-
tion. The faculty is by no means uni-
formly opposed to change. There may 
be more discontent among faculty than 
among students, for faculty members 
are closer to that position of despair 
from which it becomes clear how 
uneducational so much of the "educa-
tional process" is. 

Some of these suggestions may ring 
true. Others may not. One person 
carrying a graduate school load cannot 
make a good survey of what is wrong and 
what changes should be made. 

It does seem certain that our lives 
at Yale are not as worthwhile as they 
should be. And what we offer the society 
in return for the fellowships--or simply 
as educated citizens-bears no relation-
ship to what we should offer. 

To do something about these problems 
it would be necessary to organize across 
departmental lines, through the graduate 
department clubs whose officers could 
hold some exploratory meetings or 
through ad hoc departmental committees 
if the graduate club officers are un-
interested. 

Study groups could be set up to 
examine specific departmental problems 
and to discover whether some grievances 
are more widely shared. Ultimately 
common grievances with the profes-
sional schools at Yale and with the 
undergraduates could be explored. 

But mostly the emphasis should be on 
re-forming the content of graduate 
school life. The only way we can do 
that, if we care to, is to work together.
