John O'Leary: He played politics

Mike Mandelbaum: He played straight 
Sam Chauncey: He played secret agent 
the demonstrators. But to make sure 
that no one outside could identify which 
was her room, the Secret Service also 
closed the curtains in another room. 
Downstairs one of the Secret Service 
men looked out the window at a sign that 
said "Chirp ... Chirp ... Lady Bird" 
and asked President Brewster, "I wonder 
if that sign is derogatory." Brewster 
asked for binoculars to read the pickets' 
signs, tried, but then gave it up. 
Mrs. Johnson had brought along a 
girl to help with her clothes, but no 
hairdresser. So, after her nap, New 
Haven hairdresser Michael Snurkowski 
was sent in. His bags were checked, and 
he was questioned on each landing, and 
when it became clear that in fact he was 
the right man, the Secret Service men, 
who knew among other things that it 
was the hairdresser's birthday, sent him 
up to the top floor. Michael could see in 
Mrs. Johnson's eyes that she was busi-
nesslike and could probably be very cold, 
but he found that in this case she was 
"warm, humorous, and congenial." 
Mrs. Johnson said she'd like to come 
back sometime and spend a day without 
a schedule of any kind, just wandering 
around New Haven. Mrs. Johnson also 
said that she did not like teased hair. 
Michael thought she was remarkably 
pretty if perhaps a bit self-conscious 
about her nose, and afterwards said, 
"Anyone who had the time to study her 
face for a while could really do wonders 
with her." 
While Mrs. Johnson was laughing with 
Michael, Buddy Berkson, on his way to 
the printing press in Jonathan Edwards 
College to pick up the leaflets for 
Beinecke Plaza, was thinking to himself 
If this thing comes off, it'll be incredible 
... If SDS just keeps its mouth shut. 
At 5:00, the SDS pickets regrouped 
and marched up to the Brewster home. 
Mrs. Johnson was supposed to arrive at 
Freshman Commons at six, but 
Chauncey had asked O'Leary of the 
Political Union to come earlier, so that 
Mrs. Johnson could avoid pickets. Also, 
it had been decided to bring her in 
through the College and Grove entrance 
to Woolsey Hall and Commons to avoid 
Beinecke Plaza demonstrators. 
About a quarter before six, the 
Brewsters left their house, and drove 
around the block to Woolsey Hlll. They 
waited for Mrs. Johnson in the rotunda 
of the hall, from which a door leads to 
Freshman Commons. 
Chauncey was standing in the center 
of the rotunda, looking like a knowledge-
able Secret Service man. Next to him 
was Liz Carpenter, Mrs. Johnson's 
secretary. 
"Mr. Chauncey ... " a reporter began. 
''This is Mrs. Carpenter," said 
Chauncey, edging away to a better 
position from which to keep his eyes and 
ears open for anything. 
"Where you from, honey?" asked 
Mrs. Carpenter. 
"From a publication here on campus." 
"Well, here, you take this." Mrs. Car-
penter handed over a mimeographed 
copy of Mrs. Johnson's speech and then 
turned and headed for Commons. 
The reporter ran after Mrs. Carpenter 
and explained that he was also covering 
Mrs. Johnson as a stringer for two major 
newspapers. He had hit the forward 
button on a Texas tape recorder. 
"Mrs. Johnson had just a perfect 
vagabond day," said Mrs. Carpenter. 
"She stopped at a Shaker village, and had 
a picnic lunch by the roadside, and just 
three-and-a-half hours of being a perfect 
vagabond, which she seldom gets to do. 
She didn't have any deadlines to meet." 
"Why is Mrs. Johnson here?'' 
"She gives few speeches, you know, 
but she thinks improvement of our 
country deserves to be on the academic 
agenda, and it's so good that students 
here at Yale are interested." 
"What about those demonstrators? 
Did Mrs. Johnson see them, does sh'e 
know they're there, do they bother her?" 
"Mrs. Johnson has respect for every 
point of view, but I'll tell you this, no 
one is working harder at peace than the 
man who is our President." 
At that moment the SDS pickets out-
side the President's house were conclud-
ing that Mrs. Johnson had escaped out 
the back gate of the Brewster home. 
They started running down Hillhouse 
Avenue to intercept her. As they stam-
peded off Mrs. Johnson was hustled into 
her car from the side of the Brewster's 
house and out the driveway. The 
picketers swiveled back, almost as a 
body, but the car zoomed away, and so 
they swiveled again and resumed their 
race around the corner to Woolsey. 
Sam Chauncey, from his new vantage 
point at the main door of Woolsey, saw 
the car approaching. He also saw the first 
of the SDS pickets coming around the 
corner. 
''Where's Kingman?" he said. 
"Here," said Brewster, standing by 
himself one doorway over. ''Where's 
Mary Louise?" 
Mrs. Brewster stepped forward and 
the Brewsters repeated their down-the-
steps routine again, welcoming Mrs. 
Johnson to the intersection of College 
and Grove. 
They all stopped for pictures in the 
rotunda and then walked on into Com-
mons, pressed upon by photographers, 
who in turn were pressed upon by eager 
Political Union members. Secret Agent 
Sam Chauncey stood in the doorway, 
keeping an eye on everything. 
Five hundred people were standing in 
Beinecke Plaza as Mrs. Johnson entered 
Commons from the other side. There 
were only a few placards. One was a 
picture of a napalm-mutilated Viet-
namese girl with the caption-"U.S. 
Beautification." A few representatives 
of the High School Anti-Communist 
League held up pro-war posters on the 
Beinecke Library wall in front of 
Commons. The blonde girl had arrived 
with her frail sign: "Lady Bird Beautifies 
I While Lyndon Bombs." A band of 
hippies, led by a young man with wire 
spectacles and a bandana around his 
head, sat down in the plaza with their 
legs crossed. The young man was blow-

ing soap bubbles. 
A reporter from The New York Times 
asked Mandelbaum why anybody would 
hold a silent demonstration. "Demon-
strators against the War tend to be 
written off as irresponsible malcontents," 
he said, "which isn't true. The majority 
are very reasonable people." 
At a quarter after six, the representa-
tives of the High School Anti-communist 
League began shouting. They were 
asked to quiet down. They did. The 
loudest people now were the Negro shoe-
shine boys, ferreting amongst the 
footwear. 
By 6:20 the crowd bad swelled to 1200 
people, covering most of the Beinecke 
Plaza. More than anything else, the 
people-with the exception of the 
placard bearers and the hippies-re-
minded one of the intermission crowd 
outside a theater. There wasn't that 
tension, that sense of rage being built up 
and stored within for the final explosion; 
they were just people who had come to 
show they opposed the war. 
At 6:25 a leader of Students for a 
Democratic Society announced their 
next meeting and then urged attendance 
the next morning at draft headquarters, 
when a Quaker was going to refuse 
induction. The crowd listened quietly, 
except for a young man who shouted, 
"Johnson must go." 
Mandelbaum climbed up on one of 
the marble blocks in front of Commons, 
just east of the sarcophagus-like mem-
orial. He lifted the bull-horn, pointed it 
the wrong way, and said almost inaudibly 
that it was now 6:30 and would the 
people remain quiet for ten minutes. 
About twelve hundred people turned 
forward, facing the war monument. the 
names of the battles, and the Freshman 
Commons itself, where the wife of the 
Commander-in-Chief was going to speak 
on beauty. 
In the silence, those in front could hear 
coming from Commons the faint clink-
ing of china and silver and the drone 
of a voice over a microphone. 
Then, suddenly, a rock-and-roll 
record, the Kinks' "I'm A Dedicated 
Follower of Fashion," blared out from a 
window in Berkeley College. For a 
moment it seemed that the silence might 
disintegrate, people began to turn; but 
then, as though they had resolved as 
a single body, everybody decided to 
ignore the music and turn back to the 
silence. 
At the first sound of the music, 
Berkson and two others charged toward 
Berkeley. They were joined by a 
campus guard who had convinced the 
music players, out to disrupt the demon-
stration, to turn down the volume. As 
soon as the guard left, one of the music 
players turned up the volume 
again, said he was going to accuse 
Berkson of stealing, and lunged at him. 
Two others, and then a third, held the 
guy back; and as they were all locked in 
their waltz, the record ran out. 
Outside, it was quiet again except for 
the three boys who had climbed onto 
the memorial, and who hooted until 
asked to stop. Like members of 
a dictator's entourage curious to see the 
motley mob at the gate of the Presiden-
tial Palace, some Political Union 
members moved to the doors of Com-
mons and stared out. 
The quiet ticked by. "Remember those 
days when all we could get was 150 
people behind Coffin and Cook on the 
Green?" mused an SDS member quietly, 
as he scanned the silence. "This is not 
the most satisfying thing, but it's worth 
it. What else can you do right now?" 
The ten minutes was over. Mandel-
baum raised the bull-hom again and 
announced its end. He thanked the 
people. There was half applause, only 
slightly audible inside, and the crowd 
began to turn and leave. 
The demonstration was over. SDS 
had stuck to its pledge not to break the 
silence and no Provos had pulled down 
their pants. 
But SDS now wanted a protest to call 
its own. A blond man, standing on the 
steps, started to chant: "What do we

121 The New Journal I October 29, 1967 
want?" 
"Peace," chanted back twenty-five 
people. 
"When do we want it?" 
"Now," forty responded. 
The large number of demonstrators 
reacted to that as they had to the rock-
and-roll: first with a moment of wavering 
and then simply by ignoring it. The 
dispersing continued. So did the 
chanting. 
"Peace now! Peace now!" 
A group of ten, unable to hold still, 
unable not to try anything any longer, 
broke off and charged at Commons. 
They stopped two dozen feet from the 
building, their way blocked by three 
policemen. 
"Hell, no, we won't go ... hell, no, 
we won't go ... hell, no, we won't go ... " 
they called out to the impassive police, 
and then stopped. 
"Fuck you, you will too ... fuck you, 
you will too . . . fuck you, you will 
too ... "the High School Anti-Com-
munists shouted at them. 
And that was the end of all the · 
demonstrations outside Commons. Soon 
Beinecke was empty, except for the anti-
war leaflets, which had been picked up 
two hours before by Berkson when he 
still thought it would be incredible if 
the silence would work, and which were 
now flapping in the wind. The officers 
relaxed and leaned against the pillars of 
Woolsey Hall. 
The SDS chanting had faintly pene-
trated into Commons; the silence not at 
all. 
The only activity during the dinner 
had been Liz Carpenter. She bad gone 
from press table to press table at the 
beginning of the dinner, shaking hands 
and hunting big game, and telling every 
table, "I'd like to see a standing ovation." 
When she had returned to her own 
table, she became very annoyed because 
the NBC c~-neramen weren't pointing 
their cameras enough in the direction of 
Mrs. Johnson. 
"Those bastards," she said to one of 
the people at her table. "Give me their 
names, and I'll take care of them." 
The names were given, and then she 
was asked, "What are you going to do? 
Tell Sarnoff?" 
"No, there're other people, but I'm 
going to take care of them." 
She was silent for a moment. "This is 
a rough game, and you've got to be 
rough," she added in an almost wistful 
tone. 
A few minutes after the end of the 
demonstration, the maste( of ceremonies 
was making introductions at the 
speakers' table. John O'Leary made a 
welcoming address, probably the best 
speech of the evening, in which he 
proved very keen at finding coincidences. 
Clare Booth Luce, the last woman 
to address the Union, said O'Leary, has 
written that Mrs. Johnson is doing more 
than any other President's wife. He then 
presented Mrs. Johnson with the book 
on Yale's Vinland Map, Reuben 
Holden's book on Yale, and a wind-up 
bulldog that goes "Boola Boola." 
After the presentations, the president 
of Yale began a most ambiguous speech. 
He addressed his audience of "partisans 
of the left, partisans of the right, and 
fellow mugwumps," and then continued 
with that burp-oratorical effect of his, 
which makes it seem that he's always 
throwing away a line. 
M rs. Johnson's visit, he said, had given 
him a new awareness of the public side 
of a person who has no private life, and 
whose private life is public. 
Brewster recalled how he had opposed 
Franklin D. Roosevelt's foreign policy 
before World War II, but that his feeling 
did not prevent him from admiring Mrs. 
Roosevelt, a woman of "courage and 
compassion." Then he noted that the 
"isolationism" of his pre-1941 under-
graduate years at Yale had "come into 
vogue lately." And finally, he said, Mrs. 
Johnson is the greatest First Lady we've 
had since Eleanor Roosevelt. 
Some observers felt Brewster was 
obliquely slapping the demonstrators 
outside; others felt Brewster himself was 
noting that he opposed Johnson's war 
today the way he opposed FOR's in 
1941. Others weren't sure what Brewster 
was talking about. 
And then at last, Mrs. Johnson spoke 
about beauty. She urged all Yale men to 
devote their efforts to improving the 
environment. It was an altogether un-
memorable oration, delivered in a very 
pleasing, modulated style, a perfect 
example of Speechthink. The First 
Lady's speechwriters had done their 
homework-her talk was festooned 
with references to Yale University. 
There was nothing controversial or 
gripping; Mrs. Johnson simply urged 
beauty on the nation and gave some 
examples of how some people had 
brought about beautification. 
Liz Carpenter's ovation stood, and 
Mrs. J ohnson made her way out and 
went upstairs to a reception with the 
Brewsters in the Presidents' Room above 
the rotunda. The room was empty when 
they arrived, and Mrs. Johnson asked 
where the guests were. Brewster replied 
that they were being delayed to give the 
First Lady time to unwind from the 
formality of her speech. "Oh, don't do 
that," said Mrs. Johnson. Faculty mem-
bers from the Forestry and Art and 
Architecture schools came up. Brewster 
handed Mrs. Johnson a drink. Outside 
the room, a dozen Secret Service men 
were sitting, but only one of them was 
actually watching the room. 
The Whiffenpoofs carne in to sing. 
They formed themselves in a semi-
circle so that Mrs. Johnson WB.$ at 
their backs, but then the Brewsters 
rescued her and brought her to the 
front. One of the Whiffenpoofs, who had 
been in agony all week about singing to 
Lyndon Johnson's wife, but who had 
decided to sing after an. assuaged his 
conscience by handing a letter of protest 
to Brewster, who handed it to Chauncey, 
who was presumably going to hand it 
to one of Mrs. Johnson's secretaries, 
who would read it and then might hand 
it to Mrs. Johnson, who probably 
wouldn't tell her husband. 
The Whiffenpoofs delivered a very 
professional performance, and Mrs. 
Johnson seemed to enjoy it. Then they 
started out. Lady Bird grabbed one of 
them by the coat; it looked like she 
wanted an encore, and they were very 
pleased and came back in, but then it 
turned out that she just wanted to have 
her picture taken with them. 
Liz Carpenter, Mrs. Johnson's secre-
tary, was one of the last to leave the 
Commons downstairs. She stopped in 
the rotunda to meet her daughter, from 
Pembroke, and several of her classmates, 
who had been fixed up for the occasion 
with Political Union members. Most of 
the girls had a good time, except for one, 
who had been invited back to the room 
of the Political Union member, offered 
a drink, and then discovered that the 
member, who had sat down next to her 
on the couch, was trying to unzip her 
dress from the back. 
Mrs. Carpenter eyed her daughter 
and her daughter's friends and the 
Political Union dates and said, "Well, 
let's all go upstairs and mate." 
After the main reception, Mrs. John-
son returned to the Brewster home for a 
smaller reception and then went to 
sleep. All the doors at the Brewster 
house were kept unlocked, and her car 
was kept in the driveway for easy get-
away. 
But Mrs. Johnson was not the only 
member of the Johnson team at Yale that 
evening. Jack Valenti, introduced at 
the banquet as one of President 
Kennedy's advisors, but in fact one of 
Johnson's, even since his resignation 
from the White House staff to bead the 
Motion Picture Producers Association, 
was also up and about at Yale. 
After the banquet Valenti went over to 
the Law School to speak to a forum. His 
visit to Yale the same day was completely 
coincidental. Valenti opened himself to 
questions, and virtually every question 
was a hostile one on Vietnam. One that 
could be called non-hostile: "Do you 
think the violence in Vietnam is respon-
sible for the violence in films?" Valenti 
handled all the questions by referring to 
secret deliberations he had taken part in, 
usually in response to urgent messages 
from General Westmoreland, and never 
hesitated to use logic: "I flew missions 
during World War II and killed 10,000 
of my former countrymen. I know it. 
It's just as amoral as Vietnam, but they 
pinned medals on me for it. No one really 
saw the brutality of the war." 
Finally, Valenti showed anger, and as 
he snapped his briefcase shut, he de-
livered a brilliant expansion on his 
I-sleep-better-every-night-with-Lyndon-
Johnson-as-my-President routine, by 
describing how the President, when he 
reads the casualty lists, experiences a 
metaphorical hatchet in his heart and a 
presumably real acid stomach. And he 
concluded by pleading, "I would hope 
that you'd try to understand, to be 
tolerant and a bit forgiving." 
It was very quiet by that time on 
Hillhouse A venue in front of the 
Brewsters' house. A police car suddenly 
roared down the street and stopped 
quickly at the curb. The patrolman in 
front of the house quickly strode over 
and received a coffee-to-go from a 
plainclothesman inside the car. 
Across the street and one house down, 
15 members of SDS were camped on 
the curb. They spent all night there, 
singing some, reading sections from 
MacBird, but quietly. In the morning, 
most of them found they had caught 
colds.
