Lady Bird at Yale: 
A Question of Taste 
By Daniel Yergin and 
Mopsey Strange Kennedy 
John O'Leary, jammed back into his 
chair with his feet up on the desk, 
discounted the possibility that the 
Provos would pull down their pants in 
Beinecke Plaza to protest the War 
during Mrs. Lyndon B. Johnson's visit to 
Yale. It was late the night before the 
visit; and O'Leary, the president of the 
Political Union, was trying to determine 
whether the Political. Union's intensive 
membership campaign had netted 750 or 
850 members so that he could tell . 
Commons how much roast beef to 
prepare. 

O'Leary had been hearing for almost 
a week that radical protestors would try 
to break up Mrs. Johnson's speech to 
the Political Union in Commons, but as 
he shoved the membership lists aside, 
he was confident. 

"It would be a disaster for the Uni-
versity and for us if there was a tasteless 
demonstration," he allowed, "but there's 
every indication that .we can count on 
Yale people to act tastefully, like gentle-
men." 

The next afternoon in Heinecke Plaza, 
Buddy Berkson, one of the organizers of 
the demonstration, anxiously watched 
the .first arrivals. "It's ludicrous to talk 
about beautification now," he said, 
"when we're dropping more bombs in a 
day than the entire number dropped 
sometime during World War II. Napalm 
-we're killing people, and it's an absurd 
kind of taste to talk about beautification." 

Variations on the word "taste" were 
everywhere during Mrs. Johnson's visit. 
Even the Secret Service men, who kept 
steel eyes on everything and who never 
hesitated to shove iron-hard forearms 
into someone's stomach, were described 
as tasteful. 

The same words, but two different 
languages-that was the story of Mrs. 
Johnson's visit to Yale on Monday, Octo-
ber 9. Mrs. Johnson, inside Commons 
with the television, press, and a press 
secretary to spark spontaneous standing 
ovations. Demonstrators outside, want-
ing to be moderate and so doing nothing 
more than staring up at a war monument 
and above that to the names of World 
War I battles carved around the top of 
the Commons. Mrs. Johnson inside, talk-
ing about beauty, speaking with her hus-
band's flat missionary rhetoric about 
improving the planet; and a thin blonde 
girl outside, holding a tiny sign: "Lady 
Bird Beautifies I While Lyndon Bombs." 

The Yale Political Union was modeled 
on Oxford's Union, but has for a num-
ber of years been Yale's answer to ward 
politics, lacking as it has any sense of 
issues. In the last year or two it bas be-
come more of a forum for politicians and 
public officials. O'Leary has been active 
in this. Last summer, while working for 
his Congressman in Washington, 
O'Leary sent out a flurry of invitations to 
public officials. 

One of the invitations went to Mrs. 
Lyndon B. Johnson. O'Leary, impressed 
that the First Lady was becoming so 
publicly involved with an issue like 
beautification and conservation, asked 
her to address the Union on her work. 

A few days after sending the invita-
tion, he received a phone call from Liz 
Carpenter, an ex-Texas-newspaper-
woman who's tough like a tree stump and 
who is Mrs. Johnson's secretary. 

Mrs. Carpenter asked O'Leary exactly 
what the Political Union was, and then 
some other questions. A few days later, 
she called again to ask O'Leary to 
White House tea with Mrs. Johnson. 

So O'Leary found himself sitting down 
with Mrs. Johnson, her beautification 
adviser, and three cups of tea in the 
sitting room of the Lincoln Bedroom. 

"Mrs. Johnson was a terribly charm-
ing person, really warm," O'Leary 
recalled later. "It's amazing how the 
Texas style doesn't come over so well 
publicly, but there's just so much 
sincerity and warmth to that person." 

While they sipped tea O'Leary and the 
President's wife discussed the New 
Haven riots. Mrs. Johnson recollected 
how, three years before, she had toured 
New Haven with Mayor Lee, visiting 
new schools. She was deeply, personally 
concerned about the riots. She said it 
was hard to understand why such things 
occur. Then Mrs. Johnson asked some 
more questions about the Yale Political 
Union. O'Leary, who knew that she 
gives few public speeches, reassured her 
about the Yale Political Union. Mrs. 
Johnson turned to her beautification 
adviser and asked, "Well, what do you 
think?" The adviser pointed out that 
garden clubs and forestry schools were 
getting dull, noted the advantages of 
speaking to the Yale Political Union, and 
recommended she accept. Mrs. Johnson 
ended the half-hour tea by tentatively 
agreeing to appear. The beautification 
adviser then gave O'Leary a tour of the 
White House, but they had to whisper 
because the President was napping. 

In the first week of September O'Leary 
received another call from Liz Carpen-
ter, who said to hold open the .first half of 
the week of October 9. O'Leary im-
mediately put in a call to Henry (Sam) 
Chauncey, special assistant to President 
Brewster. Chauncey became contact 
man between Yale Administration and 
National Administration. 

Mrs. Carpenter came up to Yale twice, 
the first time to make arrangements, 
the second time to see the Political 
Union in action. What she saw was the 
film of Theodore White's "The Making 
of the President 1960." Two days later, 
during the screening of "The Making of 
the President 1964," O'Leary strode to 
the podium and said "I wish to announce 
that the First Lady of the United States 
will address the Union on Monday, 
October 9." The applause was wild. 

The following Tuesday was the 
weekly luncheon of the Aurelian Honor 
Society, a senior-class luncheon club for 
windy student leaders and some of the 
better-known campus good guys, along 
with a string of faculty members. 

Among those sitting at one table were 
the Rev. WilliamS. Coffin, always open 
to a demonstration; Steve Weisman, 
who was to find himself one of the 
three main organizers of the demonstra-
tion; Yale Literary Magazine Chairman 
Bill Lydgate, who would help on a 
secondary level; and Strobe Talbott, 
News chairman, who would endorse the 
sincerity of the demonstrators in an 
editorial. Someone at the table said it 
would be too bad to let Mrs. Johnson's 
visit pass without some demonstration. 

Everyone agreed it was a good idea, 
although no one was quite sure how to 
organize a demonstration that was 
tasteful, that was somehow, well, Yale. 

Coffin thought for a ·moment and 
suddenly became inspired. "Picture this," 
he said excitedly. "We get everybody 
to fast instead of eating dinner. They 
assemble by the thousands while 
Mrs. Johnson is inside dining with the 
Political Union. When their meeting is 
over, we get Brewster to bring her out 
to greet the protesting thousands, on 
either side of her, and receive a petition 
asking for a bombing halt. It'll be 
sensational." 

Everyone at the table thought this was 
a good idea, too, though there was some 
doubt that Brewster would agree, despite 
a Coffin scheme to threaten the Presi-
dent of Yale with pickets at his house if 
he did not co-operate. 

Buddy Berkson, student editor of the 
Michigan Daily for two years and 
general secretary of the United States 
Student Press Association before trans-
ferring to Yale, joined in from another 
table. No one felt able to spare the time 
for an extra-curricular demonstration. 

Lydgate and Weisman agreed to look 
into it, however, and in a conversation 
later in the day with Talbott at the News 
building, they decided that Michael 
Mandelbaum, a senior from Berkeley, 
California, who wants to write political 
science "for the masses," would be 
perfect. 

Weisman phoned Mandelbaum later 
and told him the news. Mandelbaum also 
thought the demonstration would be a 
good idea, but wanted to phone some 
others before agreeing to take on the 
responsibility. The decision was post-
poned. 

That Tuesday night, Students for a 
Democratic Society (SDS) held its orga-
nizational meeting. More than 125 at-
tended, and some one stood up to say 
that they couldn't let the opportunity of 
Lady Bird's visit pass. A steering 
committee to plan a demonstration was 
formed. 

Wednesday: Weisman spoke to 
Howard Shrobe, an SDS leader, who 
said that SDS would be staging a 
demonstration, but hadn't decided on 
specifics. Shrobe predicted they might 
attempt to break into Commons or just 
picket outside the Brewster home, where 
Mrs. Johnson would be staying. 

Weisman's first thought was to let SDS 
handle the demonstration, since that was 
what they knew how to do best. He 
offered to help Shrobe get campus 
endorsement for a silent demonstration, 
but Shrobe simply informed him that 
SDS would do what SDS wanted. If 
Weisman wanted to support their action, 
that was up to him. 

Matters became more complicated 
when Nick Herman, a senior who is bead 
of the Dwight Hall Campus Council, 
appeared in Weisman's room that after-
noon to say that Coffin had told 
Herman to seek him out since he was 
organizing a demonstration. Weisman 
was surprised. Herman proposed-in 
place of a demonstration, which might 
be construed as being rude to the First 
Lady-an opinion poll to prove that no 
one likes the war. Weisman, Herman, 
Mandelbaum, Berkson and Talbott 
arranged to meet for lunch the next day 
to make final plans. 

Thursday: The Secret Service men be-
gan arriving to comb through all of 
Freshman Commons and to investigate 
dining hall employees and to fingerprint 
other Yale people who would have 
contact, or near-contact, or no contact 
with Mrs. Johnson. Rumors that a group 
of Yale Provos would try some wild 
demonstration were beginning to 
circulate. 

At lunch in the Trumbull College 

9j The New Journal I October 29, 1967 
Dining Hall, Herman again proposed 
his opinion poll. None of the others 
liked it, and when they returned to 
Mandelbaum's room to continue their 
planning, Herman did not accompany 
them. The night before, Mandelbaum 
and Berkson had drafted a statement 
which was to become the basis for an 
advertisement in the Yale Daily News. 

That night, the SDS steering com-
mittee met at the home of law student 
Mark Tushnet. They agreed to picket 
the Brewster home and then join any 
larger demonstration and co-operate at 
least until the end of the demonstration. 

Friday: Petitioning for the moderates. 
In the afternoon Weisman received a 
call that Sam Chauncey, Brewster's 
assistant, wanted to see him, and be 
chugged across campus to Woodbridge 
Hall and ran up the steps and inside. 

Kingman Brewster, he discovered, was 
staring at the door from the top of the 
stairs. 

Brewster explained that he doesn't 
always stare at the door but that be was 
waiting for one more Yale Corporation 
member to arrive so that they could 
begin their monthly meeting. Weisman 
continued on to Chauncey's office, where 
he found Talbott of the News already 
arrived. They first discussed with 
Chauncey his position on the Red Sox, 
and then got around to the demonstra-
tion. Chauncey was cagey. He explained 
that Mrs. Johnson would probably enter 
Freshman Commons through Beinecke 
Plaza. Therefore, said Chauncey, the 
Secret Service would probably rope off 
a walkway for her so that her path could 
not be obstructed. Weisman and Talbott 
thought that was a good idea. The con-
versation concluded with a treatment of 
the dining hall coat-and-tie regulations. 

Saturday: The moderates hastily col-
lected petitions that had been signed at 
most of the residential colleges, but 
usually during only one meal. They were 
not able to reach graduate students, but 
they were overwhelmed at the response. 
They typed each name on an index card 
for alphabetizing purposes and dis-
covered they had obtained 600 names in 
practically no time. Many people, even 
jocks and right-wingers, had told them 
that this was the first petition they had 
been able, or had felt compelled to 
sign. 

Mandelbaum, Weisman and Berkson 
became more convinced that the mod-
erate approach was paying off. 

Sunday: The day before the visit, they 
met and decided that the best form of 
demonstration would be non-demonstra-
tive-that is, a 40-minute assembly with 
a ten-minute period of silence at the end. 

Later that evening 75 seniors walked 
out of a hall at Williams College while 
Mrs. Lyndon B. Johnson was speaking. 

At about the same time, SDS was finish-
ing its sign making. Weisman was 
arranging for the advertisement in 
Monday's Yale Daily News. Berkson and 
Mandelbaum drafted another statement, 
to be distributed to protestors explaining 
why there would be no speeches and 
why the ten minutes of absolute silence 
Would be appropriate. O'Leary was 
sitting in his office figuring out if the 
Yale Political Union had 750 or 850 
members. Buddy Berkson received word 
that a senior in Branford had been 
scrawling "Sweep foreign policy clean 
· · . bring a broom" on their posters. 

Berkson phoned the scrawler, who be-
came very angry when Berkson told 
him that they did not want any physical 
demonstrations. Lady Bird wasn't wel-
come, and she deserved no courtesy, said 
the scrawler. Berkson could understand 
how he felt. 

The next afternoon was one of 
shifting, uneasy greys that threatened a 
rain. The wind was whipping through 
the trees. The President's house, five 
stories of brick, seemed strange and quiet 
with the policemen around, as if some 
magnate were quietly dying within. 

Time itself seemed immaterial, and it 
could have just as easily been another 
age, with servants bustling about to 
welcome the young master home from 
the Civil War, or to make it ready for a 
visit by President Taft. 

One hundred people, mostly from 
SDS, many with signs, were standing on 
the Hillhouse curb, across the street 
from the Brewster home. Only a few had 
been there when Brewster himself had 
driven up; he bad talked briefly to a 
Negro picketer who was protesting what 
he said was discriminatory hiring by 
Yale. Most of the rest had come just 
shortly before 2:30, when Mrs. Johnson 
was due to arrive. The New Haven cops 
had pushed them across the street and 
had tried to make them disperse, but 
Brewster had come out twice to prevent 
that. The thin blonde girl was there with 
her small sign: "Lady Bird Beautifies I 
While Lyndon Bombs." A group of 
newspaper and television reporters were 
talking to the crowd. One of Mrs. 
Johnson's press secretaries, who had 
come up earlier, stomped over to some 
of the press and told them that the story 
was Mrs. Johnson's speaking at Yale, 
and not this demonstration, and then she 
stomped back into the house. 

All of Brewster's staff had been issued 
small orange buttons for identification, 
something like those used by charity 
campaigns. There was a control unit in 
the basement, and the Brewsters had 
turned their one television set over to 
the Secret Service men who were joined 
by Sam Chauncey, in watching the 
World Series in the basement. Yale 
Security Director John Powell main-
tained constant contact with campus 
police stationed around the house so that 
he could inform them of the last-
minute decision on whether Mrs. 
Johnson would drive in the back gate or 
come in from the front. 

Sometime shortly before 3:30, they 
decided on the front, and soon Mrs. 
Johnson drove up in a Continental with 
her secretary and mastermind, stumpy 
Liz Carpenter. The car stopped at the 
curb, and Mrs. Johnson got out, wearing 
an overwhelmingly red coat and looking 
younger and prettier than anyone had 
expected. The Brewsters came down the 
steps to meet her. A path opened 
through picketers who had crossed the 
street to the Brewsters' side. Mrs. John-
son walked past them with less attention 
than she would pay to a patch of rhodo-
dendrons. The Brewsters greeted her 
formally, and they all went into the 
house. 

Mrs. Johnson was nervous about the 
speech, after her experience at Williams. 
Brewster, sensing that she wanted re-
assurance, reassured her about Yale, that 
all things were under control, that rude-
ness does not occur at Yale. 

Mrs. Johnson went upstairs to her 
room for a nap. The curtains had already 
been closed, so that she could not see
