Fat Bernie 
By David Freeman 
DA VJD FREEMAN is Lawrence 
Langer Fellow in playwriting in the 
Drama School. 
"The day of the Broadway column is 
over. Interest today is in the cultural 
scene: good theater, good music, the 
galleries, and the new cinema."

"The name of the game is still 
entertainment."

Bernie Gersten-known to the trade as 
Fat Bernie the Gossip Broker, the best 
columns plugger in the business--starts 
each morning repeating the daily routine 
he has followed for the last nine years. 
Next to his bed on a long wooden 
table, he keeps his column items--
Bernie's joys--stacked in orderly rows, 
typed three to a sheet: 
"Judy Garland sobbing on the phone 
to me from Hollywood ('They fired 
me ... why could they be so cruel to 
my children and me. G--damn them, 
it stinks!') was one of my saddest 
experiences as a reporter. Judy is at the 
end of her financial rope now. We 
were all moved." 

Over such items are pencilled dates and 
the names of gossip columnists. For 
instance, above the Garland item: 
"Wilson June 7, Winch. June 8, Boyle 
June 10." So far no takers for Judy's 
despair. 

Fat Bernie first lifts himself out of 
bed, puts on his blue silk robe, sips his 
morning coffee and begins to route his 
items. He examines each stack of what's 
gone where and who's seen what. Fat 
Bernie, who could never waste an item, 
sees that each reject gets another chance. 
Fat Bernie is fat. He looks like a 
slightly modified Joseph E. Levine, and 
at 225 pounds and 5'6", he is so large 
that be waddles. He has a huge neck, with 
what's left of black hair curled down 
over the back and sides of his head. 
If Fat Bernie GerstenÂ· did not exist, 
Damon Runyon would have invented 
him. 

There is only one faint incongruity in 
the Guys and Dolls routine, and that's 
Bernie's speech. Although he has a heavy 
New York accent (born in Newark, N.J.), 
Bernie is educated (B.S. CCNY) and 
sounds it. 

Bernie Gersten has no regular clients, 
and he gets no retainers. He works on a 
strictly freelance basis for the press 
agents and the public relations firms 
handling the big stars which, though they 
cannot be bothered with the nuisance 
of daily gossip columnists, nonetheless 
have clients who like to see their names 
in daily print. 

Bernie Gersten receives a flat rate of 
$8 for a client's name mentioned in 
any of the New York gossip columns, 
except for Earl Wilson's column, which 
has the largest syndication and for which 
Bernie gets $10. Obviously, when Fat 
Bernie can "build a pyramid"-that is, 
cram two or three names into one item-
he can make a lot of money. 

Most major New York restaurants, 
as well as the stars, depend on public 
relations firms to keep their names before 
the public. Most of the firms farm out 
their restaurants to Bernie along with 
the celebrities: 
"Carol Channing, resting from her 
chores as femme lead in the B'way 
smash Hello Dolly quipped to close 
friend Woody Allen at Max's Kansas 
City last night: 'If you don't learn 
to write, nobody'll ever be able to 
read your picket sign'." 

That item, placed in Ed Sullivan's 
New York Daily News column, "Little 
Old New York," netted Fat Bernie $28 
-$12 from Solters and Sabinson who 
represent Miss Channing and Hello 
Dolly (Bernie charges $4 for a Broadway 
play when mentioned with a star's 
name, or $6 for the show's title alone); 
$8 covered Woody Allen, charged to 
John Springer and Associates; the last 
$8 was from Bill Doll and Associates 
who represent Max. 

The demise of the World Journal 
Tribune had its effect on a great many 
New Yorkers. It most certainly affected 
Bernie Gersten. Without the Trib, Bernie 
has only three major papers to work 
with in Manhattan. "Of course, there's 
always the out-of-town papers--Kup 
always takes stuff (Chicago Sun-Times' 
Irv Kupcinet) but it's not the same--
the whole thing is for the benefit of the 
stars-and face it, your typical star 
just doesn't give a damn about the Sun." 

Fat Bernie is also skeptical of maga-
zines: "For one thing they don't break 
the stuff for two or three months, and 
it's impossible to keep track of-1 can't 
afford to tie up one item for two or three 
months. If a piece doesn't hit, I've got 
to know right away and re-route it." 

Bernie never throws anything out. 
Aside from the table stacked with 
column notes, his apartment is literally 
filled with stacks of old magazines and 
back issues of newspapers from all over 
the country, as well as stacks of notes 
and theater programs. 

After Bernie spends his hour or two 
routing items, he reads the day's papers. 
He first carefully reads each of the gossip 
columns: there are seven in the New 
York papers that he services regularly, 
and another nine for which he often 
claims bills. Fat Bernie frequently 
identifies as many as ten items that he 
has planted in a single morning, which 
explains how he can earn up to $30,000 
a year. 

Fat Bernie bases most but not all of 
his items in fact-"Most people don't 
believe most of what they read in the 
columns-they just like to read about 
stars, whether it's true or not." 

The columnists on whom Bernie 
depends for his livelihood are, however, 
more interested in facts. They frequently 
call a restaurant to find out if Tony 
Randall was indeed there on the previous 
evening eating the chefs Ottopode al 
Forno. The restaurants, however, have 
learned that if they deny the presence of 
a star they are quickly dropped from 
Fat Bernie's beat and from the columns. 

After checking the columns, Bernie 
turns to his black accountant's book, 
in which be records the fruits of the 
previous day, then relaxes and leisurely 
reads the entire Post of the preceding 
evening and then glances through the 
News. He only bothers with the Times-
no gossip columnists-on Sunday. 

Although he has not had particularly 
good luck with Lewis Funke's "News of 
the Rialto" (Broadway) or Abe Weiler's 
film notes in the Sunday Times, he keeps 
trying, and he does break items there 
occasionally. Bernie feels that the class 
of the Times is worth the effort. 

After Bernie has routed his items, 
done his accounts and read the papers, 
he rises up again and puts on a white-
on-white shirt with collar points that 
droop almost to his waist, and selects a
