**A Response to John Wilhelm's Critique of Mayor Lee**
**Author: Lanny J. Davis**
**Page number(s): 14-15**

radicals and black militants who have 
made Mayor Lee their scapegoat, have 
questioned the basic power structure 
upon which this country has rested since 
its inception. In this sense, their inquiry 
and ensuing criticism are healthy. A 
power structure which has economicaJly 
and socially (and, until 1863, physically) 
enslaved a large section of its population 
is in urgent need of re-examination. 

However, the fervor of John Wilhelm's 
ideology prohibits him from evaluating 
a man like Mayor Lee in relative, as 
well as objective terms. For Wilhelm, 
of the unique mixture of pragmatism and 
idealism which the Mayor bas so ex-
emplified can only be interpreted as a 
cowardly surrender to the monied forces 
of the establishment power structure. 

The rarely disputed point that Mayor 
Lee, des_P.ite the shortcomings which he 
admits to his urban renewal program, 
is head and shoulders above any other 
mayor in America-such a fact is ir-
relevant to the radical. For him, relativ-
ism is meaningless; degrees of progress 
and success are beyond consideration. 
Measurement is in terms of the absolute: 
change must be total and, if necessary, 
violent. 

There is certainly a place--or at least, 
should be a place in the American 
political heritage for such radicals. But 
not in an assessment of a Mayor's 
achievements. In objective terms, one 
then criticize that city's mayor for not 
clearly been one step ahead of all other 
urban leaders for not being two steps 
ahead. One should not scorn the concept 
of a perfect, utopian, "model" city and 
being perfect and incapable of error, 
himself. 

The tragedy of Wilhelm's criticism of 
Mayor Lee, and others like him, is that 
it supplies additional fuel to those who 
oppose progressive, affirmative action 
in the nation's urban centers-this at a 
time when such action is so desperately 
needed. 

Hopefuly, the gap between the 
Wilhelms and Lees of this nation-a 
gap not, in reality, as large as it seems--
will gradually close as communication 
and understanding replace polemics and 
rhetoric. The alternative to such an 
ultimate meeting of the minds is 
polarization and dogmatic rigidity-a 
prospect which would have grave con-
sequences for all concerned.

Wilhelm's Reply: Mr. Davis will no 
doubt be surprised to find that I essential-
ly agree with his evaluation of Mayor 
Lee. I would first, however, like to 
correct some of his more serious errors 
of fact: 

I) It is common knowledge in New 
Haven political circles that the Mayor's 
o~e has more than passively cooperated 
With the FBI in its investigation of the 
Hill Parents Association. 

2) Mayor Lee did in fact make a series 
of agreements with the HPA leaders on 
Sunday of the "riot week". I refer Mr. 
Davis to the article by Rev. Raymond 
C'hulze, pastor of the Zion Lutheran 
C'hurc:h in the Hill, in the American 
Independent Movement Newsletter of 
AuSUSt 21. Rev. Chulze, who attended 
tbe Sunday meeting between Mayor Lee 
and HPA leaders, describes in detail 
the aareements reached and his shock 
and frustration when they were almost 
immediately broken. 

3) The claims Mr. Davis makes for 
the redevelopment program are astound-
ing. He must be using a very strange 
definition of low-income. Louis Kahn's 
Central Hill Project is discussed in a 
Redevelopment Agency brochure: most 
of the housing described is middle-
income and not low. Mr. Davis ought 
to look at the brochure. 

I am amazed to hear that "almost one-
half" of the housing built or planned 
as redevelopment is low-income. If 
Mr. Davis would check with the research 
people at the redevelopment agencies, 
he would find that the figures I quoted 
for rnid-1965-700 luxury apartments, 
976 middle-income-are accurate. He 
would also find that since 1965 only the 
small Fair Haven project I referred to 
plus some housing for the elderly have 
been opened in the low-income field. He 
will find finally that there are plans on 
the drawing board for no more than 
token numbers of low-income units. 

4) If Mr. Davis is at all acquainted 
with New Haven, he should know that 
Mayor Lee bas not "Jured" Sargents to 
the city. Sargents is an old family firm 
that was here before the Mayor was 
born. 

I do not want to quibble at length 
with Mr. Davis' errors. What interests me 
most is that both Mr. Davis and I agree 
that Lee "is head and shoulders above 
every other mayor in America ... " 

That Lee is probably the nation's best 
mayor is precisely the point. If he cannot 
solve the urban crisis any better than 
he has, then we cannot do the job with-
out basic change. Mr. Davis may know 
some "radical" for whom the Mayor's 
clear superiority is "irrelevant". I think 
it is quite relevant. I am sorry that he 
felt compelled to fit me into some pre-
determined image. I am sorry that he 
felt compelled to cloud my arguments-
and his--by throwing about loaded 
words and phrases like "insidious" and 
"conspiracy theory". Mr. Davis got 
neither such words nor the tone they 
conjure from me. 

On the contrary, it is not because I 
dislike Lee personally that I say that, 
as Mr. Davis puts it, one step ahead is 
not fast enough. The Mayor is trying to 
convince those that are already powerful 
that they ought to save our cities. I did 
not by accident use the word "tragic" 
in my article. Because those who have 
power now will not make changes that 
seriously endanger their power or wealth, 
Lee's efforts have proved fruitless. 

Tragic figures always evoke sympathy, 
but sympathy for the man should not 
cloud our political judgment. 

We face the incredibly difficult job of 
mobilizing the American people to 
force the powerful to give up their 
control. If that job is not done, the 
frustrated poor will simply tear the 
country up because they have no 
alternative. 

As for Mr. Davis, I hope that he can 
discard the fact-finding methods he 
perfected while chairman of the Yale 
Daily News and which he continues to 
use as chairman of Students for Lee. 

If he ventured out into the streets and 
alleys of the city and listened to the 
desperate people who this summer re-
sorted to "rioting", he would discover 
many things that are not apparent on the 
narrow path between campus and 
City Hall.
