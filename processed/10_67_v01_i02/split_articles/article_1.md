'Tis Pity

As everyone must know by now, John 
Ford's 'Tis Pity She's A Whore concerns 
the incestuous love between a brother, 
Giovanni, and his sister Annabella. The 
point to the incest, however, is that it 
provides a way of talking about the 
necessity to make desperate private 
choices in a world where there are no 
common public values. And such a world 
is the Parma which surrounds the 
lovers, where ruthless Soranzo sues and 
eventually wins AnnabeUa's hand, where 
Hippolita, rejected by Soranzo, plots his 
death with his servant Vasques, who 
then betrays her; where Bergetto, a 
ridiculous fop, is murdered by Grimaldi, 
another suitor of Annabella, as Bergetto 
goes to marry the niece of Richardetto, 
who is actually Hippolita's cuckolded 
husband, presumed dead and now re-
turned in the guise of a doctor. The 
public world is, in short, one of disease 
in its double sense of sickness and of 
unrest, where all public institutions, like 
the Church, and public ceremonies, like 
feasts and marriages, are corrupt and 
meaningless. The soul of the body politic 
has been rotted by the "leprosy of lust,'' 
and the city is a humming corpse. 


The play depends for its success upon 
our acceptance of Giovanni's and 
Annabella's love in this monstrous 
world. For if the lovers do not somehow 
win us and our admiration, then there 
is no tragedy of isolated individuals 
frantically dreaming of wholeness (the 
play speaks of "wholesome"-ness and 
"holiness") while surrounded by decay. 
Because on one hand, the incestuous 
lovers are certainly not the angels they 
would like to be or think they are, while 
on the other they must &e allowed to 
earn our sympathy, the tone and balance 
of Ford's play are both extremely 
delicate. If they are mishandled, we are 
left not with pathos but with mere 
pathology and murky, bloody bombast. 


The production opening night (Octo-
ber 16) by the professional Yale Reper-
tory Company, under the direction of 
Kenneth Haigh, was disappointing 
chiefly because this focus was blurred 
throughout. We were never really given 
any clear cut reason to be more inter-
ested in the lovers than in their squalid 
surroundings. There were some glim-
mers, but what resulted finally was a 
fitful spectacle which did not have any 
sense of pace until late in the evening. 
By then one's most vivid impression was 
of a shouting match, often to no point. 


Mr. Haigh, who is a distinguished actor, 
made his directing debut with this pro-
duction, and the direction had an actor's 
hand. Instead of a developed, or develop-
ing, point of view or any discernible 
rhythm in the play, there was obvious 
attention lavished upon scenes as discrete 
units and upon actors as individuals. 
There was also, as there should have 
been, an actor's emphasis upon the verse, 
with little action, fewer props, not much 
business. People were brought out, lined 
up and made to speak. This necessary 
and proper emphasis had mixed results. 


In some cases, it elicited very fine 
individual performances, but several 
polished performances do not make 
a play, any more than several good lines 
make a poem. In other cases, one felt 
Mr. Haigh had gone to great effort to 
graft the style necessary for this kind of 
verse where there was no friendly host. 
To do this kind of play requires extraor-
dinary control of voice and of body, a 
kind of discipline not everyone had. 


The chief offender, unfortunately, was 
the male lead. Giovanni should attract 
us despite the fact he is lustful, wilful, 
selfish and a demon of energy. But as 
played by Richard Jordan, he did not. 
Giovanni's anguished sophistry became 
petulance; and his self-assertive mastery 
of his fate, a series of tantrums. Mr. 
Jordan opened the play at a peak neither 
he nor anyone else could sustain or 
surpass, and there was no place to go. He 
raced through ttte lines as if they were 
after him, usually at the top of his voice. 
There is in acting a crucial distinction 
between volume and intensity. The 
power of a line is not necessarily 
enhanced by saying it louder. 


Because of her unforced repentance 
and her constant concern for her brother, 
Annabella is naturally a more sym-
pathetic character than Giovanni: in 
many ways her acceptance of their fate 
at the end is more impressive than his 
assertions of control over it. As 
Annabella, Kathleen Widdoes seemed ill 
at ease and unsure in the beginning, 
and this partially accounted for the lack 
of fire in the all-important wooing 
scene between Giovanni and Annabella. 
In the second part, however, when the 
play, and the pace, picked up, Anna-
bella's fierce constancy to what she 
thinks or hopes she has found in her 
brother's love came through. 


In the last scene between brother and 
sister, Miss Widdoes and Mr. Jordan 
were very good. There the proper tone 
of genuine devotion in the midst of 
treachery and sham was caught. We were 
finally made to realize what we should 
have been aware of all along-that these 
people are somehow different, that a 
great price must be paid to win a private 
peace from a public world where the 
norm is war. The success of this scene, 
one of the best in the production, 
may have been partly the result of the 
fact both actors were sitting down. They 
no longer had to contend with the steeply 
raked stage and the treacherous pyra-
mids on either side over which everyone 
was forced to scramble throughout. In 
that last scene, Giovanni and Annabella 
could concentrate on each other and not 
on their footing. 


In many ways, the set was an image 
of the whole production. Like the pro-
duction, it had some fine individual 
qualities: the seams of the great beetling 
copper cubes seemed to drip, and if 
molten gold is a feature of Hell, as the 
Friar has it, then Parma seemed visually 
hellish indeed. Again, like the direction, 
the set put the emphasis on the verse, 
for the raked stage and the what-ever-
they-were to right and left drastically re-
duced the playing area and the actors: 
freedom of movement, emphasizing the 
language with those mixed results. Fi-
nally, the set, with its profusion of 
arches, stairways, doorways, platforms 
and slopes mirrored the production's 
own confusion, its lack of a controlling 
point of view, which was manifested 
particularly in the vague and muddled 
treatment of the lovers. The lack of a 
firm vision of what the play was about 
was generally reflected in the set and 
costumes, which were mod-futuristic. I 
know this kind of thing is meant to 
release the action from seventeenth 
century Parma, and make it "timeless," 
or relevant to our day, as they say. But I 
don't believe this notion-it is basically 
a gimmick which always indicates that 
someone has no faith in a great play's 
capacity to be relevant or timeless in its 
own terms. It always means someone has 
made a simple-minded equation, or con-
fusion, between universal and modern. 


For the past year or so, we have 
been sternly shepherded out of the 
valleys and plains of The Old Way and 
up the Professional Mountain, urged 
always to look upwards and watch the 
stars. Those who have strayed have 
been dealt with smartly. From my 
position at the back of the flock, I 
would say we had not yet quite reached 
the top. But we are getting there. Be-
cause this production, for all its 
unevenness in tone and over-all con-
ception, does stimulate and quicken 
you. What one of his contemporaries 
caJied Ford's "purer language" is all 
there before you, and it does oftentimes 
catch fire and glow, at once thickening 
and purifying the atmosphere of Parma. 


Though everyone's list ':Viii differ, I 
recommend to you the performances 
of John Karlen, whose control of the 
verse and of himself brought the right 
cutting edge to the seething, vicious 
and finally deeply wounded Soranzo, 
and of Paul Mann who was appro-
priately, and appealingly, weak and 
patient, hopeful and overwhelmed as 
the Friar. Particularly good was Tom 
Rosqui who caught the insidious and in-
different brutality and casual corruption 
of Vasques with great ease and skill. 
This Spaniard, pleased to overgo the 
Italians in satanic arts, was the most 
polished performance of them all. 


Almost equally as impressive, however, 
was Lydia Fisher's portrayal of 
Hippolita. Miss Fisher played the lusty, 
intriguing ex-paramour of Soranzo with 
understanding and assurance and real 
range. The most powerful scene of the 
production on opening night was the 
one between Miss Fisher and Mr. Rosqui 
where Hippolita and Vasques use each 
other in ways which make it clear how 
everyone in Parma, with the exception 
of Annabella, is a whore. 


Miss Fisher is not a professional; she 
is a second year drama student, two 
years out of high school. Perhaps she is 
the most convincing proof of the Dean's 
contention that the students will best 
learn by watching professionals. On the 
other hand, perhaps she supports the 
conviction that those students who have 
the art born in them deserve the Uni-
versity stage. But, then, all this, gentles, 
is matter for another day. Go see the girl.
