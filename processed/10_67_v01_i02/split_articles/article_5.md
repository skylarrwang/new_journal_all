silk suit from a closet full of silk suits. He 
is now ready to begin his rounds, hunting 
for items. 

He always carries a reporter's pad 
and an Old Fashioned drinking glass in 
a black briefcase. The pad is to jot down 
what he calls "Gotham gossip." The 
glass is to hold. Bernie spends his days 
in bars and restaurants, and finds that 
if he's not careful, he's drunk by 5 in 
the afternoon and poorer the next day 
when doing his accounts. He eats at 
moderately-priced restaurants, but 
spends his working day in Sardi's, 21, 
The Colony and the like. 

He has discovered that if he takes his 
glass out of his briefcase and holds it 
when he enters a restaurant, bartenders 
leave him alone and friendly customers 
do not insist that he have another drink. 

Although Bernie prefers to work in 
New York-going from restaurant to 
restaurant keeping his eye and ear 
attuned to the stars, meeting the press 
agents and courting the columnists, be 
occasionally works on out-of-town 
projects. One item that has become 
near apocryphal on Broadway is the 
result of Bernie's finagling. It also 
provides a glimpse into Bernie's sense 
of ethics about the creation of news. 

When Broadway producer David 
Merrick was to travel to upstate New 
York (near Poland, N.Y.) to open a 
county fair, Bernie bet Harvey Sabin-
son, Merrick's press agent, that he could 
turn the event into a column item; 
Wilson, Lyons and company, being 
none too enchanted with the notion of 
the Poland, N.Y., County Fair, turned 
it down flat. 

Bernie, after contemplation, learned 
of the existence of a small and obscure 
tribe of Shawnee Indians living outside 
of Poland. Fat Bernie called the chief 
(whose name be cannot recall) and told 
him of Merrick's impending visit. 

Bernie suggested that the Shawnees 
make Merrick an honorary blood 
brother. Bernie promised the chief a 
great deal of publicity for the event, 
which he pointed out would be good for 
their souvenir business. The Shawnees 
not only delivered, but made Merrick 
Brother Blwan-Biwan-Pum, which 
translated means Collector of Wampum. 

The event made all the columns, with a 
headline in Lyons and Wilson-at $20 
per headline, which Sabinson personally 
matched, as the loser of the wager. 

In general, if the event actually 
occurred, no matter what the circum-
stances, Fat Bernie does not consider 
any item the least shady: "It happened, 
didn't it? Just because I had the chutzpah 
to call that Indian doesn't mean it didn't 
really happen. It's not like I made it up." 

On the other hand, Bernie is acutely 
aware of the dangers, both ethical and 
practical, in concocting items: "People 
are always suspicious, you got to be 
careful. The agents don't care, but if 
the stars read rigged plants they call 
the columns. It's crazy, they just cut their 
own throats, but that's the way it is." 

Fat Bernie doesn't keep a real office. 
If he's not working out of his apartment 
or a restaurant or bar, he'll use the offices 
of the producers and press agents for 
whom he freelances. 

Blaine-Thompson, the ad agency that 
handles most of Broadway's advertising, 
k~ps a special desk for him on opening 
DJghts. After any Broadway opening, 
the producer and the ad men gather in 
Blaine-Thompson's, located in the Sardi's 
building, to comb the advance copy of 
the reviews to make up those huge quote 
ads that fill the pages of the New York 
Times. 

As they labor, Fat Bernie sits to one 
side batting out column notes about the 
show. When he's completed three or 
four separate items (each a paragraph in 
length-although they are frequently cut 
to seven or eight words in the paper), 
he rips the sheet from the typewriter, 
careful to tear the bottom edge ("ifs got 
to look hot-even if I wrote it yesterday, 
it's got to look hot") and moves breath-
lessly downstairs into Sardi's main dining 
room, where he begins his hunt, a subtle 
thing. 

As he enters Sardi's, he takes a casual 
look around the room, to spot Earl 
Wilson, Leonard Lyons, Hal Boyle, 
Jack O'Brian, Florabel Muir, Winchell 
and the others. 

His prime target is Wilson, and if 
Wilson sees Bernie going first to O'Brian, 
Wilson will be upset. Bernie can't allow 
that; Wilson must get the first crack at 
the items. ("In the old days it used to be 
Winchell. Nobody reads Winchell any-
more, today it's all Wilson.") 

U Wilson hesitates, Bernie has a 
choice. He can leave the item with him 
for a day to let him decide and thereby 
take it out of circulation, but gain 
Wilson's favor (of vital importance), or 
he can demand that Wilson say yes or 
no on the spot, and if it's a no, move on 
to Lyons, Boyle or Florabel. 

The problem is not to infuriate any of 
the writers by making them feel last on 
his list. This is no easy trick, when there 
are frequently three or four of them 
sitting within 25 feet of each other, and 
all acutely aware of Fat Bernie's pres-
ence. Bernie must operate diplomatically 
and table hop with agility. 

In Sardi's, they're used to him so that 
he doesn't have to pull out his Old 
Fashioned glass. 

He's still standing at the door, waiting 
for Boyle to move away from Wilson so 
that he can make his first move. Boyle 
moves away and Bernie moves in. 

Wilson is sitting by the wall, watching 
a room full of stars and almost-stars. 
"Earl, I see you for a moment?" 
"Hi Bernie, whatta you got?" 
"Exclusive to you. Warren Beatty's 
getting married. You want it?" 

Fat Bernie pats his pocket as he 
speaks, indicating that the item-ripped 
and stuffed into an envelope-with more 
details is available; he's careful not to 
wave the envelope, conscious that at least 
one or two other writers are watching 
the conversation. Wilson thinks for a 
moment, surveys the room, stirs his 
drink. 

"Who's Beatty marrying?" 
"Don't know yet. Follow-up tomor-
row, I hope." 

Now Wilson thinks that Fat Bernie 
is trying to parlay the item into a number 
of placements-ten bucks for the first 
Beatty announcement, and another ten 
the next day when the woman's name is 
announced. Or maybe Bernie only rep-
resents Beatty for the moment and is 
trying to line up the girl's press agent 
before be places her name. 

"I can use it Wednesday," Wilson 
finally says. 

Bernie thinks for a moment-by 
Wednesday the item will be public 
information, no longer of value to him. 
Or maybe Wilson has another lead on 
the item. Bernie knows he's struck out 
with Wilson and prepares to move on to 
Lyons. 

The problem now is that Bernie must 
move fast. He's given Wilson the lead 
on an item, and that means there's no 
longer an exclusive on it. Wilson could 
dig up the information on his own, and 
then break it after Bernie has given it as 
an exclusive to Lyons or Florabel. 

He moves to Lyons. 
"Len, got something for you." 
"What?" 

Lyons never looks at Bernie, he keeps 
his eyes trained on the crowd. 
"Warren Beatty's getting married. 
You want it?" 
"Who to?" 
"Don't know." 
"How long can I have it?" 
"Tonight. It's hot." 
"I don't think so, maybe Wednesday." 
"I'll be back, I got more for later." 
"OK." 
"See.you, Len." 

Fat Bernie moves away from Lyons 
with an eye out for Boyle. Boyle's already 
talking to one of the legmen from the 
office that represents Beatty. 

News is out, Bernie has to work fast. 
He turns away from Boyle. Don't be 
seen noticing . .. hang on to exclusive. 
He moves toward the center of the 
crowd, working fast. Find one ... place 
it quick. 

Flora bel Muir is roaming around. 
F/orabel'/1 do. 
"Florabel, honey, I got to talk with 
you." 
"You look like somebody's getting 
married." 

Bernie smiles. "You want it?" 
"Who else has it?" 
"Nobody from me. Can you use it 
tomorrow?" 
"Who is it?" 

Fat Bernie hesitates, glances around 
the room, senses that he's about to lose 
ttie item, and moves in for the kill. 
"Tomorrow, honey, yes or no?" 
"Wonderful." 
"Warren Beatty. An actress, in his next 
picture-names still a see-key." 
''Thanks, dear, maybe I'll use it." 

Fat Bernie hands Florabel the en-
velope, a little crumbled from his 
pocket. Florabel floats away, and Fat 
Bernie spots Jack O'Brian heading his 
way. Bernie doesn't notice him, and 
ducks back to the elevator. He beads for 
Sardi's side door and out into the alley. 
A small note about the routing of the 
Warren Beatty piece in his notebook, 
and Fat Bernie lurches toward the Stage 
Delicatessen and a pastrami sandwich.
