other special effects for the shop. 
"Some of the stuff we made because at 
the time it wasn't generally available," 
explains Meyer. 

Aside from these specialty machines, 
Meyer has designed a number of fairly 
intricate lighting effects as well. This is 
the end of the business that really gets 
Meyer going. On a scrap of paper he 
makes a sketch as he describes his 
"starburst chase unit," a minor master-
piece of lighting technology. 

Several years ago he began building 
"chase strips," which are rows of lights 
wired to give the appearance of the 
movement of light along a line. Meyer 
has produced several versions of the 
chase strip. In some, lights will ripple 
and then bounce back, or chase a black 
spot down a row of lights, or add and 
subtract their way up and down a 
series of lights. He's even made one 
that can be controlled by a stereo 
system. "If the music is loud, it will go 
very fast," he explains, "and if it's soft, 
it will bounce back and forth lightly." 

The chase strips are usually used with 
his starburst unit. "It has the effect of a 
circle of light, expanding and contrac-
ting. It is like a propeller spinning." 

Like so many of his lighting inven-
tions, Ed Meyer keeps in constant mo-
tion. He is an integral part of a theatre 
world that never stops. "Theatre is a 
microorganism that, once it gets into 
your body, doesn't get out," he says. 

Meyer stands up and moves around 
the room. He says he finds it hard to sit 
still for very long. "I think I get tired in 
a different way now, being in the of-
fice," he says, "If I had someone who 
was capable and I could trust, I would 
much rather be out at the warehouse 
making the deliveries myself." 

But Meyer has no time auymore to 
putter around the shop building star-
burst chase sets and fog makers. Stage 
L ighting Rental Service, which only 
last month bought out its only local 
competitor, will need more organiza-
tion than ever. "I guess," he says, "the 
kind of thing I've been doing all the 
time is not the sort of thing you expect 
someone .my age to be doing."
