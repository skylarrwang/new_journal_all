Have football, will travel 
What do Zimbabwe and Ireland have 
in common? Internal conflicts, 
violent histories and the Yale Rugby 
Club, which visited the African na-
tion two years ago and will travel to 
Ireland this spring break. 

"We didn't know what we were get-
ting into," said captain Paul Carbery 
'83, of the trip to Zimbabwe, then 
Rhodesia. "We were told that we 
would play two white teams, two 
black teams, and one mixed one. We 
played only one team with one black 
player, and he was only a token." 

The group went to Africa as cor-
porate representatives of Union Car-
bide, which sponsored them. They 
stayed in first class hotels and 
"palatial" country homes. 

The Yale team was the first foreign 
group to play in Zimbabwe in 15 
years, and they played some of the 
best teams in the country. "In one 
game we played a team with five in-
ternationals on it," said coach Scott 
Kelso. The team learned a great deal 
about rugby, but couldn't beat the 
world-class teams they faced. 

Kelso sees the Ireland trip as 
another chance for the team to learn 
from more experienced players. Most 
Americans do not have a chance to 
play rugby until college. "A large part 
of my activity is teaching the basics," 
said Kelso, who played for the U.S. 
Rugby team from 1973-76, and now volun-
teers his time to the club. Although it 
finished the fall season with a 10-3 
record with victories over Harvard, 
Princeton, and Brown, the club may 
still find international standards dif-
ficult to meet. 

In Ireland the team will stay most-
ly with players in Derry, Kelso's 
home town. In its search for a spon.:

panies doing business in Ireland. 
Labatt's Beer has helped by sponsor-
ing the weekly Rugby N ight at the 
Anchor Bar, but the club members 
will have to pay all their expenses 
which cannot be covered by fund-
raising. 

"The wonderful thing about rugby 
football is that it's the only sport 
played by all Irishmen, regardless of 
their religion," said Kelso. T he team 
will travel through both northern and 
southern Ireland. On the last day of 
the tour, after playing a Dublin club, 
the Yale footballers will go to 
Lansdowne Road to watch a team of 
Irishmen play the English national 
team. 

"We're going to a troubled 
country," said Kelso. "We learned a 
lot about the relationship between 
blacks and whites in Zimbabwe, and 
we'll learn a lot about the relationship 
among people of different religious 
persuasions in Ireland. But mostly 
we'll learn a lot about rugby."
