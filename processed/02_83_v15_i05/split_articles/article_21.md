For about 15 dollars a week you can fill 
your room with bubbles, float a layer 
of fog above your desk or shoot 
cobwebs over the boxes in Yale Sta-
tion. A 51-year-old man with a gray 
ponytail named Ed Meyer will rent 
you the equipment. He can also rent 
you spotlights, pipes, clamps, cables, 
gels, hats, doors and chandeliers. For 
any conceivable event- from a H allo-
ween SAC party to a Bar Mitzvah to 
an uncut Shakespeare-Meyer has the 
tinkertoys to pull it off. 

Anyone who has worked in theatre 
at Yale has at least heard of Ed Meyer 
and Stage Lighting Rental Services. 
Everyone who has walked into a col-
lege show has seen his stock. And if 
you're a lighting designer, his old 
green bakery truck is probably as 
familiar as the family car. You can feel 
it coming; you can spot it a block 
away. Finally it drives up, and a soft-
featured man with eyeglasses and a 
clipboard steps out. M eyer looks like 
Ben Frankhn with bluejeans. l-Ie's got 
the kind of slow and rolling voice that 
makes you calm down, and there's a 
precision in his style that somehow 
assures you 
the show will come 
together. 

H e thumbs through the 
yellow carbon invoices and finds your 
order: 50 lighting instruments, a 
power pack and the hardware and 
countless odd-shaped pieces that make 
it all connect. A lot of equipment 
comes out of the green bakery truck 
when M eyer makes his rounds\ but it 
is hardly a sampling of what remains in 
the SLRS warehouse. 

A fun house
The warehouse fits Meyer's character. 
It's an inconspicuous, unassuming 
brick building set back from the road. 
T here are no signs out front , no lights 
or parking lots. Like Meyer, SLRS 
keeps a low profile. But on the inside 
there's a full-scale business in motion. 
The cluttered warehouse doesn't seem 
to make any sense, but to Meyer's 
curious sense of order, everything has 
a place. There are 820 lights hangin~ 
in racks. They make up a third of the


The warehouse alone. Other racks hold fix-
tures and cables. The cement floor is 
covered with a dozen boxes filled with 
important-looking metal gadgets of 
mysterious design. A crated chandelier 
hangs from the ceiling, and a couple of 
strobe lights rest half-hidden in the cor-
ner. It's a theatre person's Fun House. 

Besides Meyer, several other people 
work at SLRS. "J" Seaman manages 
the shop, and Dean Clark makes most 
of the pick-ups and deliveries. Lenove 
Shapiro and Martha Lasko work as 
"Theatrical Equipment Service Tech-
nicians," which is a way of saying 
that they fix the lights. When Clark 
backs up the service truck and flips 
open the doors, everyone helps unload. 
One job is back, bu t another one has to 
go out in five m inutes. And there are 
two more deliveries to make in the 
afternoon. That's the way SLRS 
operates-two hours of calm, then all 
at once the squeeze is on. Quickly, 
Seaman pulls an armload of lights out 
of the truck. 
"Wow, they're warm, they're warm." 
Seaman's breath shoots out like smoke 
into the cold air of the warehouse. 
"Warm parcans!" 
"Well, if they're warm, they don't 
belong here." 
"Everything we do here we mark 
with colored tape." 
"I n eed fifteen 50s." 
"Where are the 50s living?" 
"You're there." 
"Okay, fifteen 25s?" 
"They must have fifty-foot wrenches 
down there." 
"Just step over the things instead of 
on them." 
"We really need to get this place 
organized. It usually isn't like this." 
C lark slaps the door shut. Delivery 
time. 

Ed Meyer rarely get 
to make 
deliveries anymore. H e has to spend 
most of his time keeping track of all the 
paperwork for SLRS. H e works at 
home, a gray clapboard on Gilbert 
Avenue across 
town 
from 
the 
warehouse. 
Like 
warehouse, 
Meyer's Â· office doesn't waste space. 
There's a lot to look at, a lot to keep a 
tinkerer occupied. Art books, puzzles. 
toys, plants and a computer terminal 
for recording the changing inventory. 
And on the countertop, buried under 
register tape and paper scraps, sits a 
telephone. It rings every time you look 
at it. "I'm more organized than I look," 
says Meyer, "but I'm not as organized 
as I'd like to be." 

From physics to the theatre 
Stage Lighting Rental Service hasn't 
always required so much organization. 
Meyer took over the business during 
his last year at the Yale Drama School 
in 1968. He had originally set out on a 
different career. After graduating from 
Carnegie Tech in Philadelphia (now 
Carnegie Mellon Institute) with a B.S. 
in physics, he spent nine years writing 
electronics manuals and doing theatre 
on the side. Although Meyer had been 
interested in theatre since high school, 
he studied physics because "nobod y 
bothered telling me it was possible to 
get into theatre. Besides, I think there 
would have been a major battle at 
home if I had dropped physics for 
theatre." 

While writing electronics manuals, 
Meyer began putting more and more 
time into the technical end of theatre. 
"It got to the point where I was spend-
ing more time on theatre than on my 
job," says Meyer. After thinking it 
over, he moved from Long Island to 
New Haven and enrolled 
in the 
Technical Design and Lighting pro-
gram at the Yale Drama School. 

Before Meyer came to Yale and 
started his business, there was only a 
small lighting operation run by a hand-
ful of drama school students. The
