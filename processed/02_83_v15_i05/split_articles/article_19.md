wonder what sort

â€¢Jt was pretty incredible. It may be one of my 
fondest memories of Yale; our big game was 
against Pierson last year. They had AI 
Daiman (who was at that time captain of 
Yale~ wattrpolo team and was a great polo 
player) and we had Mark Schoofs. We had 
lost one and they hadn't lost any. We were 
going into it all out. It was a tough game; 
we couldn't afford to substitute. They had us 
by three goals with two minutes left in the 
game ... " 

A dirty "tube" schedule taped to the 
door assures me my pilgrimage is at 
an end. Somewhere beyond those two 
inches of Oak is a man they call Curt 
Frueh-pronounced "Kirt Free." The 
name has a Dick Tracy comic-book 
ring. It belongs to the tuber who now 
captains the Berkeley team that defla-
ted Pierson in an all-time thriller final 
last year. 

Captain Curt is not as large as I had 
expected- at most 165 pounds. As he 
relates the tale of Berkeley's triumph, 
his speech is slow and calculating. His 
large aquiline nose spews forth smoke 
"Water Is the great equalizer ... " 

in two steady, powerful jets. I place 
him somewhere between Humphrey 
Bogart and Sylvester Stallone. But 
then the lighting isn't so good. 

Frueh must fill the tube left by last 
year's legendary captain Joan Rabbits 
(a woman whose habit of "face lifting" 
opponents won her recognition as 
THE CLAW.) Many think he's done 
it. Berkeley, undefeated in over a year, 
is odds-on favorite to clinch the title 
again this year. Ten wins, no losses, no 
draws and no prisoners; it's an awe-
some record. 

But what is even more awesome is 
that it belongs to Berkeley. This is a 
college which has traditionally been in 
the cellar of virtuaJiy every intramural 
sport. How is it that Berkeley has come 
to dominate the inner tube circuit? In-
tramural director, Ed Mockus could 
only guess at an explanation, "Maybe 
these are just the sort of people who are 
going to do well at this sport." 

Berkeley coach Mike Sullivan (also 
captain-elect of Yale's men's water polo 
team) explains his side of it, "With 
other colleges being so good at so many
