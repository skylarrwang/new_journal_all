that ten to 15 percent are uninhabit-
able; they have no plumbing or elec-
tricity. 

We drive along a block of one-story 
apartments. The tiny front yards are 
bald dirt, scattered with children's 
toys. Young black men and women 
stand in green-edged doorways or stare 
out of green-paned windows. The Dix-
well area is the original black com-
munity in New Haven. Many came 
from the South. The neighborhood has 
not become mixed like the Hill, which 
incorporates Irish, Italians, Hispanics 
and blacks; Dixwell is 90 percent 
black. About 80 percent of Elm Haven 
is occupied by welfare mothers. 

Empty lots break the monotonous 
line of brick buildings. In one, paper 
bags and cans roll with the wind. 
Scraps are plastered and frozen to the 
ground. Driving out Dixwell Avenue 
we see empty houses and new houses, 
both boarded up against vagrants. 
Some are scrawled over with graffiti. A 
large black woman stands on a porch, 
calling to her children down the street. 
The house behind her is just a frame. I 
cannot imagine that she lives there. 
Perhaps she lives next door, in an old, 
but warm-looking house, painted part 
yellow, part blue, part gray. 

Further down the street, the shiny 
blue and white Olin Research Factory 
stands enclosed by a tall wire fence. In 
the back a re two steel factory build-
ings. Across the street the door of a 
neat, red-brick facade reads, "U.S. 
Repeating Arms, One Winchester 
Street;" it is the old Winchester rifle 
factory. 

Olin and U.S. Repeating 
Arms are major employers in New 
Haven; the Science Park project, coor-
dinating Yale, the city and Olin, is at-
tempting to revitalize industry in the 
Dixwcll area. It should improve Yale's 
relations with the poor around it. 

Fair Haven 
Fair Haven's social problems are less 
severe than those in the two neigh-
borhoods we've left. Set off by the river 
and the highway, it has resisted over-
crowding because other neighborhoods 
cannot encroach. The Fair Haven 
community is mainly Italian, Irish and 
H ispanic. Liz says, "The Hispanics 
seem to be doing better than the 
blacks- perhaps because their skin is 
lighter, perhaps because they've been 
in New Haven a shorter time and are 
Jess cynical." Some store fronts along 

the main street are being renovated. 
But many "For Rent" signs are up 
alongside. 

The industrial area of Fair Haven 
next to the harbor is more run-down 
than the town center. Useless train 
tracks that met freight ships years ago 
trail down the streets. Lines of old 
warehouses, broken, boarded-up 
buildings, have bright signs. Evidently 
business goes on in this ghost-town. 
Down the street, the wind whistles 
through a gingerbread-style factory, 
Brewery Sq.uare. A plaque above the 
entrance archway reads "1896." Above; 
a new green and yellow sign advertizes 
the refurbishing of the building. 

Walking by the river, I look at a 
bulky paper bag by my feet; inside are 
the pieces of a wine bottle. Two young 
boys holding their fathers' hands pass 
me, chattering in Spanish. More 
Spanish voices come to my ears from 
the playground across the 
street·: 
teenage boys are playing basketball. 
The skyline behind them is an uneven 
iine of cranes, oil tanks, chimney-
stacks, an I-95 overpass and a few 
trees. The smell of petroleum is foul. I 
head back to the car. Two Hispanic 
men drive by and leer at me. A girl 
walks past a nd smiles shyly. 

Soon we're heading towards East 
Rock on Livingston Street. We drive 
by some of the loveliest homes in Con-
necticut-only a third of a mile from 
Elm Haven. The contrast is upsetting, 
but the tour has not called me to decry 
wealth, only to work as one with the 
poor, to strengthen the poor. 

It all comes together at the top of 
Ea!;t Rock. The city is tiny below. I 
cannot see the broken gtass and 
charred brick. 
I 
cannot discern 
·dangerous 
from 
safe, 
poor from 
wealthy. It occurs to me that this is 
what I should see- a city as one com-
munity. With this in mind, I return to 
the streets below.
