The tour begins on Saturday morn-
ing, whcp the streets are almost empty. 
Liz is careful that we stay unnoticed in 
the neighborhoods. l am disappointed 
that we will not meet and talk to people 
along the way, but Liz is definite. 
"There's a lot of hostility toward Yale 
among the New H aven poor," she 
says, and she respects that hostility. 
"Yale is a rich institution with walls 
and gates, and it remains closed to the 
community. Scholars have scrutinized 
the place and left. The people feel like 
guinea pigs. People write huge num-
bers of books, but they don't do any-
thing." Liz does not want to repeat that 
offense. 

I don't often leave the blocks between 
Chapel Street and the Divinity School, 
Payne-Whitney and Macy's, because 
it's not safe. But this Saturday morning 
I am standing on the Oak Street Con-
nector and heading further out on The 
Alternative Tour of New Haven. I'll 
visit the deprl'ssed areas of the city 
-the Hill, 
Dixwell_ Avenue, rair 
Haven. This tour is not a formalized 
lament and protest of poverty. Liz 
Shaw, a second-year student at Yale 
D ivinity ~chovl, has orgamzea a tour 
to show students the New Haven that 
exists around Yale- to take them 
through streets they don't usually see. 
It brings them into the midst of 
poverty. Liz wants to educate students 
about New Haven and prompt them to 
involve themselves in city-aid projects. 
"I hope it will be depressing and inspir-
ing," she says. Her introduction makes 
my stomach tighten; I wonder what I'll 
find and how I'll respond. 


Sodom Hill
In the quiet morning we drive west on 
College Street. "It used to be called 
Sodom Hill," Liz says, and we smile at 
the nickname; the Hill is still notor· 
ious. "It's got terribly high crime, high 
unemployment, and bad drug prob· 
lems," 
Liz says. 
We 
first 
pass 
something that looks like a concrete 
prison. It is Richard C. Lee High 
School, a product of the urban renewal 
of the 1950s and 60s. There the school 
day is as short as legally permitted 
because of budget and staffing prob-
lems and because discipline cannot be 
maintained. 

We park on Cedar Street outside 
Columbus House, an emergency shel· 
ter for the homeless. Liz estimates that 
each night, 250 to 400 people in New 
Haven have no place to sleep. "They 
spend the day at the Green or the 
railroad station, and many come to the 
Hill at night." Columbus House pro· 
vides a hot meal and a bed for some of 
the homeless. "They need volunteers 
here now," Liz says. "You work in 
four-hour shifts, and they'll give you a 
place to sleep." 

Liz is slowly pressing a clenched fist
into the palm of her other hand as she 
speaks. She does this when she talks 
about helping the poor. "We have to 
involve ourselves as inhabitants rather 
than whiz through as students," Liz 
says. In a year, she will have both a 
Master of Arts in Religion from Yale 
Divinity School and a Masters in 
Social Work from the University of 
Connecticut. She runs the Alternative 
Tour as a program of the Center for 
Human Rights and Economic Justice 
at Yale Divinity School, which she co-
coordinates. The Center provides in-
formation- books, periodicals, leaf-
lets, movies- about local, national and 
international human rights issues. 

Housing on the Hill is among the 
worst of New H aven. Many people are 
homeless or in unhealthy conditions. 
The stately homes throughout the 
neighborhood have lost their grace. 
Now they might house three or four 
families. Landlords allow houses to 
deteriorate; most do not live in their 
buildings. Yards are unkempt and lit-
tered; the paint is dull, chipped and 
thin. Lattice and shutters are broken. 
The problem, Liz says, is "economic 
drain:" once people make money, they 
leave. Virtually no one on the H ill has 
funds to maintain or refurbish the old 
houses. 

Yale owns a lot of real estate on the 
Hill; "In the 1930s it was a slum 
landlord," Liz says. People resent Yale 
because it does not pay taxes and 
because it has a history of buying land 
and doing nothing with it for a long 
time. "The medical center stands 
where St. John's Cathedral used to be," 
Liz explains. "Yale bought it, tore it 
down, and built nothing for years. 
Some people are still angry about that. 
One woman on the Hill has an expres-
sion for Yale: she calls it an 'octopus' 
because it reaches out and grabs land 
all around it." 

Fourteen percent of the housing is 
vacant. Next to the run-down 20th 
Century Garage a house stands board-
ed up. Its porch columns are askew, 
and the stoop has been kicked in and 
made a dump for bottles and bags. T he 
vacant houses are inevitably the site for 
vagrancy and arson. C ity kids and 
landlords seeking insurance money are 
mainly responsible for the fires. 

Across the street stands the shell of a 
Victorian-style house. But high up on 
the front wall, an elegant, oval window 
remains intact, as if it were a special 
symbol of neighborhood · pride. Next 
door is a row of uniform, stocky new 
houses. A woman is shaking a red mat 
out one of the doors. A young blond 
boy rides his minibike around and 
around the block. Federally-subsidized 
housing- Section 8, it is called- is be-
ing constructed throughout the Hill. 
They are two-story, tan-colored com-
plexes. They are inexpensive, and 
waiting lists are long. 


A victimized neighborhood
As we drive along Congress Avenue, I 
see a group of six or seven black men 
lined up in front of a store. They stare 
into the car. They are not talking or 
doing anything in particular, just 
standing, just leaning against the 
walls. I see group after group like this 
the entire length of the street. 

The streets of the Hill are the 
ground for an acute drug problem. 
Last April 1 the police arrested 45 peo-
ple in a 
raid that cleared it up 
somewhat. Lights were then installed 
over the main roads, but the effect was 
mainly to push the drug-dealing and 
related crime into side streets and other 
neighborhoods. "People on the Hill are 
frightened, and the neighborhood is 
the victim," Liz says. 


"But the people living here are less 
afraid than outsiders,'' Liz says. 
"Sometimes our fears come from what 
we don't know." She tells us about an 
elderly, Irish Catholic woman who 
grew up on the Hill and who now is 
unemployed. "She's a gutsy lady. She's 
a person who likes people, and she's 
proud of the Hill. She loves showing 
you the good side. She told me, 'We 
have to pick up and care.'" I ask Liz 
how this woman can still have pride in 
this degenerated neighborhood: "Well, 
there's something about being some-
where all your life. Going to the same 
stores you wept to as a kid. There's a 
character to the n~ighborhood that still 
exists, despite the cha nges." 

Seeing the bad and the hopeful in 
the neighborhood has inspired Liz. "I 
have a tendency to fall in love with ug-
ly cities," she laughs. She spent much 
time involved with the Presbyterian 
C hurch as she grew up in Baltimore. 
"When you're a minister's kid, you've 
got to be active in the church," she 
says. Through the church she first 
·became interested and involved in ur-
ban social work. "I see the gospel as a 
call to living a lifestyle in solidarity 
with people struggling to meet daily 
needs," she says. 

But Liz does not want to be or-
dained. "I am angry ~ith the church," 
she says, "angry at what I see as inac-
tion. I won't deny the service of 
pastoral ministry. But I feel the church 
isn't addressing peoples' needs as it 
should be. You have to empower the 
poor to help themselves, and churches 
aren't doing that enough . And it's very 
human to turn our backs because it's 
painful to see. But as Christians, and 
as human beings, we are called to do 
something, because the dignity of 
every individual is involved. We have 
to look, even when it hurts to look." 

And so the tour brings people face to 
face with poverty. 


Bright spots
Bright spots stand out in this decrepit 
neighborhood. The concrete of Lee 
High School is monotonous and deso-
late, but driving past it, we see all of a 
sudden a 
brilliantly-colored mural 
covering one long wall. It tells the story 
of a mass of people, mostly black men 
and women. The mural starts with a 
row of broken-down city buildings 
marked "CONDEMNED." The win-
dows ar~ shattered, and black smoke
