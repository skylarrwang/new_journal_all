A question of caah 
Whatever the combination of aca-
demic and political reasons which led 
to the split between Yale and the 
ROTC, the fact remains that students 
interested in Yale do not have the op-
tion of turning to ROTC for financial 
support. 

In these strained economic times for 
both students and the University, 
many proponents of ROTC's return 
argue that ROTC could help ease the 
shortage of financial aid money. As 
one officer in the New Haven Naval 
Recruitment Center remarked, "If you 
go to MIT they'll give you $42,000 
plus $100 spending money a month. 
Who could turn it down?" Students at 
Harvard and Princeton can have their 
entire educations paid for and can 
receive a monthly stipend. The Air 
Force ROTC paid a year's tuition for 
one Harvard sophomore, 
Robert 
Brown, y~t he is under no obligation to 
serve or pay back the military. Such 
cases demonstrate the military's will-
ingness to pay good money to attract 
first-rate 
officers. 

As a Princeton 
freshman who is involved with the 
military there remarked, "Princeton 
students go for it because of the 
money. If they were serious about the 
military, there are a lot better pro-
grams than ROTC." 

Matt Countryman, a Berkeley soph-
omore and active member of CAMD 
(Campaign Against Militarism and the 
Draft) dismisses 
these financial 
arguments for having ROTC on cam-
pus. He questions why any student 
should feel compelled to choose ROTC 
simply for financial reasons. "There is 
no reason why individuals should have 
to turn to the military in order to pay 
for their education," argued Coun-
tryman. He thinks that it is Yale's 
responsibility to search out alternatives 
to the problem of financial aid. "It is 
unproductive for the government to 
pay students to train to kill people and 
to be part of a military system that at-
tempts to solve tensions, yet only in-
cre;ues them," said Countryman. 

Secretary Wilkinson says the 
University is willing to explore the 
return of ROTC, but only as an ex-
tracurricular activity. He warns that 
any return must observe the guidelines 
established by the faculty about credit 
and the status of military officers. "If 
the services had a genuine desire to 
come on campus, we could work out 
an agreement," contended Wilkinson. 
ROTC's inflexibility, not Yale's, is 
blocking any such return to campus, 
he says. Although some argue that 
Yale should solicit ROTC's return to 
ease the financial aid crunch, Wilkin-
son believes that "it is very attractive, 
but one doesn't exchange principles for 
cash." 

Smoke-screens? 
Although the financial issue is perhaps 
the most immediate issue, the question 
of ROTC can raise a philosophical 
debate as well. Professor Zornig argues 
that the exclusion of ROTC from cam-
pus is unfair, particularly since Yale is 
dedicated to the toleration of a diversi-
ty of opinions. "Yale should be a safe 
haven for differing points of view," said 
Zornig. "Eyeryone should be 
welcome;" Zornig 
notes 
that the 
University provides space for many 
liberal organizations through Dwight 
Hall. H e believes that Yale should at 
least welcome the more academically 
rigorous Naval ROTC, which he is 
confident Yale could easily support. 

While arguments abound in support 
of ROTC's return to Yale, many peo-
ple in the Yale community have serious 
moral 
reservations 
about 
allowing 
ROTC back. Reverend John Van-
norsdall, the University Chaplain, is 
one of these people. He warns that 
Yale must guard against intrusions in-
to a student's pursuit of a liberal arts 
education. "Yale must not make a com-
mitment to occupational preparation. 
We must protect the value of the liberal 
arts education at all costs," argued 
Vannorsdall. H e believes students in 
ROTC have made a commitment to a 
career in the military, which he 
believes intrudes upon the liberal 
education. 

Rob Morrow believes that academic 
arguments such as these are simply 
"smoke screens." He contends that the 
credit issue could be resolved by 
upgrading ROTC courses in military 
law, military history and navigation. 
And Morrow argues that the criticism 
of ROTC as preprofessional is unfair.

In his opinion ROTC is more in keep-
ing with the liberal arts than MB&B 
and C omputer Science. 
"Military 
Scienn· is simply the study of human 
interacuon." he said. 

Presently there are 
very 
few 
military-oriented courses at Yale. Two 
Political Science courses, "Intelligence 
and Covert Operations" a nd "Eval-
uaung Nuclear Strategy," as well as a 
College Seminar entitled "The 
Anatomy of War" are Yale's only 
courses which stress knowledge of 
military affairs. 

Commitments to the country 
Tht• question of ROTC's return has 
led a number of people to consider 
what role Yale should play in society. 
E~onomics Assistant Professor Jen-
nifer Roback, one of Connecticut's 
leading Libertarians, argued last year 
in a Political Union debate against the 
return of ROTC to Yale. She believes 
that it is important for Yale to main-
tain its autonomy, so that it can take 
polit1cal stands when it needs to. "Ac-
cepting money from the government is 
a dangerous thing," said Roback. "And 
from the military it is even more dan-
gerous." Roback believes that by allow-
