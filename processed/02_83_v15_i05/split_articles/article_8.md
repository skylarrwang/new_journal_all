I do not want women to have power over 
men, but over themselves. 
-Mary Wollstonecraft 

For years I took a dim view of 
feminism . I considered myself an in-
dividual first and a woman second. I 
intended to succeed in my chosen field 
on the basis of my merits as an in-
dividual, and it made little difference 
to me whether that field had tradi-
tionally been open to women or not. I 
was not interested in preparing the 
way for women to follow me, nor was I 
particularly interested in the struggles 
of those women who had preceded me. 
I expected to encounter difficulties jug-
gling a career and a family, but I felt 
that I would be capable of handling 
these. I was concerned with my future 
and my needs, not with those of wo-
men in general. 

Women in our circumstances may 
easily adopt this attitude. With the ad· 
mission of wqmen to Yale College 13 
years ago, the facilities here that had 
been available only to men were op· 
ened to us. Our generation of women 
is fully integrated into college life. 
Female undergraduates participate in 
most facets of Yale and at many levels. 
It seems possible to reject feminism as 
obsolete. 

But my own feelings have been 
changed, not strengthened, by my ex· 
periences at Yale. My view of Yale is 
colored by the years I spent at another 
college. Bryn Mawr was founded in 
the late 19th century because there was 
an urgent need to provide women with 
the educational opportunities that 
schools like Yale provided for men. As 
a women's college, Bryn Mawr was 
forced to prove itself to men who 
claimed that the students would 
become invalids. Some urged that the 
school be dosed. These "authorities" 
believed that women could not and 
should not be educated as men were. 
Bryn Mawr responded by setting stan· 
dards that were at least as high as those 
of the men's colleges. The outstanding 
achievements of numerous graduates, 
together with empirical evidence of the 
increased physical strength of Bryn 
Mawr students, disproved the college's 
challengers. Bryn Mawr's dual com-
mitment to academic excellence and to 
the education of women persists to this 
day. 

It is accepted as fact at Bryn M awr 
that women can be intelligent, ar· 
ticulate and multi-talented. The 
history of the school was shaped by 
such womer.; 
the administration, 
the faculty and the students provide 
ample additional proof. Among these 
women I found role models, mentors 
and friends . At a women's school more 
women learn to take charge and to 
speak for themselves. M y classmates 
and I took for granted that women can 
be leaders and that each should do 
whatever her talents allow. There are 
certainly talented and assertive women 
at Yale, but they have succeeded in an 
environment defined largely by men. 

At Bryn Mawr I felt part of a continu· 
ing tradition of bright a nd determined 
women. Until I left I did not realize 
.how supportive that tradition can be. 

My decision to transfer to Yale was a 
diflicu1t one, dictated by a variety of 
factors. I was warned that I would en· 
counter male chauvinism , but I have 
found less than I expected. I am more ,
disturbed by the 
lack 
of female 
chauvinism. There are many extraor-
dinary women at Yale, but few seem to 
identify strongly with other women. 
Some appear unaware of the ac· 
complishments and potential of 
women. Our presence at Yale is the 
legacy of others who had to fight for 
opportunities in ways that we do not, 
but we know little of their efforts. There 
has not been enough time to establish a 
tradition of women at Yale that we 
may feel part of, and there are few 
traditions in the formal sense that bind 
us together. 

Some Bryn Mawrters may scoff at 
step-sings or Lantern Night, but these 
are part of a shared experience that 
unites students past and present. Bryn 
Mawrters return for Lantern Night the 
way Old Blues come back tor football 
games. There is plenty of tradition at 
Yale, but most of it involves Yale's con-
tribution to the ranks of the men who 
have shaped this country. There is lit· 
tle with which women can feel comfort-
able. Th,. formal traoitions that still ., 
dominate Yale-secret societies, sing· 
ing groups and 
Mory's- are 
no~· 
open to women, but they are still insn·


tutions developed by men and for men. 
We have yet to establish our own tradi-
tions. Hut even a change in th1s situa-
tion will not be enough as long as the 
faculty and the administration of the 
university remain 
predominantly 
male. Our greatest disadvantage here 
is that there are few women outside our 
own age group to whom we can turn 
for advice and support. 

The lack of role models, mentors 
and traditions for women at Yale has 
made me realize the strength I derived 
from those at Bryn Mawr. What was 
taken for granted there is not made ex-
plicit at Yale. I feel bound to prove that 
women do have an enormous range of 
capabilities. 

I 
rejected feminism 
because I felt it asked me to be a 
woman first and an individual second. 
I could not accept that demand. But I 
no longer feel that it is possible for me 
to consider myself an individual first 
and foremost. I am a woman and an 
individual, and to separate the two, to 
emphasize one at the expense of the 
other, is a distortion. I was admitted to 
Yale as an individual, but as a woman-
( feel somewhat out of place here. M y 
experiences 
as an 
individual are 
shaped by the fact that I am female. 

I will always have difficulty labeling 
myself a feminist , but terminology is 
not important to me. It is important 
that I not lose sight of the fact that I am 
a woman and of the responsibility that 
entails. I must continue to build on the 
foundations laid by others. We are no 
longer confronted by many of the 
problems that faced previous genera-
tions, but there are more subtle 
challenges. We must not stop proving 
ourselves now that we are at Yale. The 
struggle to get here is over. But the 
struggle to become established has just 
begun. If we neglect this respon.sibility, 
we deny the tradition that brought us 
this far, and we cheat ourselves.
