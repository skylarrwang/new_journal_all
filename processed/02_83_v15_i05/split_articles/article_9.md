**Corporate Jocks?**

Seniors have been known to wait in 
line at Career Advisory (CAPS) for 
hours to get an interview, but recent-
ly one company turned the tables. 
Procter & Gamble's Sales Division, 
which recruited here earlier this 
month, has long operated on the 
theory that students who row, throw 
or run for a varsity team are the kind 
of people who can make a good sale. 
And so, the makers of such house-
hold notables as Crest, Orange Crush 
and Tide have once again solicited 
student recommendations directly 
from the Eli coaches. "Over 20 years 
ago a Yale ex-varsity player decided 
that a sound body would make for 
sound peace of mind in the P&G 
sales," explains Ted Noyt·s, director 
of CAPS and surrogate father to 
Yale's buckling business magnates. 
"He thought that participation in col-
lege athletics would give an in-
dividual the competitive edge needed 
for P&G." 

But how many new Yale lettermen 
and women will fill the ranks of 
P&G's Sales Division next year? Not 
many. Maybe it was the rumor that 
swept the country last year that Satan 
worshippers controlled the company 
(the P&G logo with 13 stars was ade-
quate proof for some), or maybe it 
was simply that the corporate hea-d-
quarters are located in Cincinnati. 
But for whatever reason, the Elis 
haven't been nocking to P&G as they 
did in previous years. 

Several overtly competitive athletes 
were pleased that their coaches had 
nominated them for interviews, but 
most of them didn't take the Head & 
Shoulders manufacturer too seriously. 
"I just used it for a practice inter-
view," says one letterman, explaining 
that he dreaded the idea of living in 
the Midwest. But the rumor about 
devil worshippers didn't deter me at 
all." 


**Stellar fellows**
**Author: Lauren Rabin**

Breakfast with Steinbrenner. Lunch 
with Liv. Tea with Prime Minister 
Lee and dinner with Dreyfuss. These 
celebrities, together with Paul 
Newman, Gloria Steinem, Isaac 
Asimov, Norman Mailer and 
numerous others, comprise a star-
studded list of Yale residential college 
associate fellows. 

Although some, like George Bush 
(Davenport), Dick Cavett 
(Saybrook), Gerald Ford (Timothy 
Dwight), and former Supreme Court 
Justice Potter Stewart (Berkeley), are 
Yale alumni, more often the; affilia-
tion grows out of a personal relation-
ship with the master, or simply a visit 
to the college. 

Each college m ay take on as many 
as five new associate fellows each 
year. "Most of us treat it like a club, 
usually waiting for someone to resign 
before making a new appointment," 
says Berkeley Master Robin Winks, 
who is also Chairman of the Council 
of Masters. 

Most fellows make generous finan-
cial gifts every year. Others, like 
Prime M inister ·Lee Kwan-Yew of 
Singapore and Kin g Baudouin and 
Queen Fabiola of the Belgians, ex-
tend their hospitality to visiting col-
lege members. Many fellows visit on 
occasion . Calhoun Master Davie 
Napier believes that "most of them 
truly value the association and would 
be disappointed if they were dropped 
from the rolls." 

However, the relationship often 
wanes, as in the case of L iv Ullmann 
whose Calhoun affiliation was the 
result "of her friendship with a 
previous master. "We probably 
should do more to make sure that 
these associate fellows want to main-
tain their affiliation at the end of 
their five year terms," Napier admits. 

Winks recently wrote Senator George 
McGovern, who was appointed in the 
midst of his presidential campaign 
and has since, "done nothing for us 
whatsoever." The letter reminded the 
senator of the responsibility which ac-
companies his Berkeley fellowship. 
"That's usually all it takes," says 
Winks, who believes that the fellows' 
apathy often stem s from their lack of 
familiarity with the college system . 
"Sometimes they just don't know how 
they can help us," he explains. 

Not all associate fellows are world 
renowned. Some, like Berkeley's 
William Zimmermann, are local 
celebrities. Zimmermann, 86, is the 
oldest ticket-taker at the Yale Bowl. 
The father of a Berkeley graduate, 
Zimmermann often ate a few meals 
in the college, p rompting several 
students to ask Winks to name him 
an associate fellow. H e happily 
agreed and led Zim mermann into a 
dining hall full of cheering Berkeley 
students. He now faithfully attends 
fellows' meetings, and charges his 
meals at the exclusive "Berkeley 
C lub."
