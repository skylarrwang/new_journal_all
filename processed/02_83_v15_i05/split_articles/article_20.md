EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Super-tuber Curt Frueh takes aim· 
other sports, and Berkeley not being 
~ood ... it's as if we're the ugly duck-
hogs of sports. It's something to really 
be proud of that we're good in Inner 
Tube Water Polo. 
People take it 
seriously." 

People haven't always taken ITWP 
so seriously, though, and many stilJ 
hold prejudices against the sport. "I 
thought of it as a complete wimp-out 
sport," admits one varsity crew athlete, 
"parallel to co-ed touch. You know, 
smaJI, fat people desperate to get on 
a'!Y intramural team. Populated by 
pallid-faced, calculator-toting, pre· 
meds looking to round out their 
resumes ... " 

. Not only was the sport's legitimacy 
an ~uestion, but a lot of people thought 
of tt as some perverted aquatic orgy. 
"What an awful game," said Tom Far-
rell, 
a 
philosophy major studying 
ethics. "You have to wonder what sort 
of pervert thought it up." A junior in 
T.O. was less moralistic. "I saw it as a 
chance to live out my mud wrestling 
fantasies." 

And for many uninitiates, the con· 
cept of ITWP still conjures an unusual 
m1x of fascination anci revulsion. 
When Mockus proposed the game in 
1980, it was over cries of protest from 
administrators who felt that any co-ed 
game played in inner tubes was "not a 
YaJ_e. sport." And when I proposed 
wntmg an article on the sport, it was to 
a chorus of jokes about rubber caps, 
getting wet and scoring. My proposal 
~ways appeared at the bottom of story 
hsts under headings like "Inner Tube 
Water Orgies," or "Inner Tube Sex," 
and finally under the none-too-subtle 
header, "Water Sex." 

Frueh is aware of these fanciful 
myths about ITWP, and admits to 
having believed 
in them himself. 
"Yeah, last year it struck me, too. In-
ner tube water polo? WHAT? It 
sounds ridiculous- sounds absolutely 
n"diculous! But it's a real sport with real 
field positioning and conditioning, 
speed and quickness: all those things 
that make for a very tough team sport." 

Not only is ITWP tough, it is per-
haps the most vigorously battled sport 
on the intramural scene. Both Berkeley 
and Branford accuse other colleges of 
photographing key plays in their 
games. There's a well substantiated 
rumor that T.D. secretly video-taped 
an opposing team's game in order to 
pinpoint weak spots. Branford cooly 
cut the old and the weak from its 
streamlined six tube machine. The 
Pierson team has its own set of "de-
signer tubes," and Berkeley's looking at 
getting specially designed swim caps. 
It's not a game where courtesy, mild 
manners or the ~ial graces are going 
to get you very far. 

Though the first ITWP regular 
season was only last year, the origins of 
the game are shrouded in mystery. 
Mockus speculates that the game may 
have originated somewhere in the 
Mid-West, but admits the trail is faint. 
He remembers taking the rules from 
some old journal which has since 
disappeared. And so, the first man or 
woman to connect the scerninl{ly 
disparate concepts of inner tube and 
water polo, like the inventor of the 
wheel, must remam forever anony-
mous.

II. 
Stuffing my clothes in my third floor 
locker in Payne W hitney, I head out to 
play my first game. I look up at the 
rows of stern-faced Yale men who line 
the hallway. They seem to look scorn-
fully down on me and my Speedo. 
NOT a Yale sport, they all seem to say 
in unison. I parry with a defiant 
gesture. 

It's a game of self-exposure. No 
J-P ress cotton comes between the 
world and your acne problem. Even 
your tinted Clearasil washes off in the 
pre-game shower. It's just six men, six 
women, a dozen tubes ofT a Mack 
truck and an unvarnished lust for vic-
tory. 

You have to get there early if you 
want to round up a good tube. You 
want one that doesn't leak, big enough 
to comfortably englobe your rear end. 
If the tube is too big you11 slip too deep 
in the water and increase water resis-
tance; if it's too small, you'll be top 
heavy and easy to capsize. Ideally, you 
want one with a valve that won't leave 
a permanent scar on your side. 

Three men and three women make 
up a team, but many colleges have se-
cond lines to replace failing starters. 
They sit back in tubes about a yard in 
d iameter and propel themselves back-
wards, paddling with alternating arms 
and using either the "eggbeater" kick 
technique or the more traditional "flut-
ter." Either way, you're not going 
anywhere particularly quickly.
