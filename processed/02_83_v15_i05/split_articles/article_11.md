**Title: The ROTC tradeoff**

"What ROTC and the American government 
do to the Vietnamese and to the black people 
of this country are not academic questions. 
We demand the ROTC be tctally abolished 
at Yale." 

These harsh words appeared 14 years 
ago in an SDS (Students for a Dem-
ocratic Society) policy statement only 
two months before the Yale faculty 
decided to strip ROTC (Reserve O f-
ficer Training Corps) of academic 
standing. Throughout the Ivy League 
faculties were voting to del}y ROTC 
programs the academic credit they had 
enjoyed for decades. During the tur-
bulent year of 1969, Yale's ROTC 
unit, the oldest in the nation, was 
essentially killed. 

As anti-war 
feelings 
subsided 
ROTC slowly made its way back onto 
Ivy League campuses. At the Universi-
ty of Pennsylvania, Cornell and MIT, 
where ROTC never left, both Army 
and Navy ROTC are offered. At Har-
vard over 70 students, the most in a 
decade, now participate in an ROTC 
program through MIT. Princeton of-
fers 
Army ROTC 
as an extra-
curricular activity. But ROTC has not 
returned to Yale since it left in the ear-
ly 
1970s. 

A 
few 
students train 
elsewhere, but essentially Yale has 
divorced itself from the military. 

One of the few Yale students · who 
train elsewhere is TO junior Rob 
Morrow. Morrow completed his first 
two years of ROTC training over the 
two summers prior to attending Yale. 
For two more years, Morrow traveled 
once a week to Bridgeport and once a 
month to Storrs, making- a car a neces-
sity to complete his training . 

But aside from the matter of in-
convenience to students, the issue of 
ROTC at Yale raises interesting ques-
tions about the nature of a liberal arts 
institution and Yale's role in society. 

There is also the question of financial 
aid. ROTC students receive a monthly 
stipend of $100, and many also receive 
full tuition scholarships. With sources 
of financial aid drying up and govern-
ment loans becoming harder to obtain, 
ROTC is now a logical choice for 
many students across the country. Will 
Yale have to sacrifice some of its inde-
pendence in order to secure financial 
aid money which enables lower and 
middle income students to attend? 

While many people argue that Yale 
should once again have a unit, Yale's 
complicated past involvement with 
ROTC makes its return a question of 
principles and priorities as well as cash. 

A volatile history 

In 1916 the Army chose Yale as the site 
of the first ROTC unit in the nation. 
With an impend ing -war and the need 
for trained officers steadily increasing, 
the ROTC was designed to commis-
sion young men into the military while 
allowing them first to attend college. 
Througn ROTC the services hoped to 
attract well-educated officers, the so-
called "civilian soldiers" who would 
have knowledge in the humanities as 
well as expertise in military strategy. 

By 1926 the Navy had opened an 
ROTC unit on campus, establishing 
Yale as one of the foremost suppliers of 
civilian soldiers. 

During the late 1960s relations be-
tween Yale and ROTC became in-
creasingly strained. The problem of 
giving Yale credit for ROTC courses 
which had plagued the program since 
its inception finally was resolved in the 
1969 
faculty 
vote which stripped 
ROTC of its academic standing. The 
year before, the faculty had lowered 
the number of courses needed to 
graduate from 40 to 36. With this 
lightened workload, they thought that 
students interested in ROTC could 
train on their own time. By a 4-1 
margin the faculty voted to change 
ROTC's status to an extracurricular 
activity without credit. They also 
denied the military officers who taught 
these courses the professorial rank 
they previously had enjoyed. 

Secretary John Wilkinson, Dean of 
Undergraduate Affairs in 1969, was a 
member of the Course of Study 
Committee which recommended that 
the faculty take away ROTC's credit. 
Wilkinson says ROTC chose to leave 
of its own free will. He says that the 
faculty had no control over the courses 
being taught by the ROTC and 
therefore decided to deny them credit. 
"ROTC courses simply weren't up to 
the level we expect from Yale courses," 
explained Wilkinson. But Wilkinson 
believes the credit issue had less to do 
with the departure of ROTC than did 
the change in status of the entire pro-
gram. He thinks that the ROTC left 
campus because the services "didn't 
want to be treated as anything that 
strikes of second class status." Wilkin-
son added, "It was rather sad to see 
them go. They were first-rate guys." 

Although the faculty and the Uni-
versity administration maintained that 
their action wa~ motivated solely by 
academic concerns, the heightened 
ami-military sentiments which pervad-
ed most college campuses certainly in-
fluenced Yale's decision as well. In-
deed, Yale's problem with ROTC was 
comparatively mild. At Harvard, hun-
dreds of students in the SDS occupied 
one of the main 
administrative 
buildings on the Yard, University Hall, 
protesting Harvard's 
position 
on 
ROTC. The takeover ended early one 
morning when 
police 
raided 
the 
building with tear gas. Thousands of 
Harvard students responded by boy-
cotting classes for a week and pressur-
ing the University to act. Backed into a 
corner, the faculty voted 385-25 to take 
away academic credit from ROTC. 

Although the circumstances at Har-. 
vard differed from the less violent 
situation at Yale, the faculty actions 
were very similar. 

At Yale, Harvard and elsewhere, 
ROTC succumbed to both academic 
and political pressures. "It took the 
combination of the academic credit 
issue with the anti-war issue to bring 
this to a faculty vote," said Kingman 
Brewster, former Yale president. "If 
there hadn't been credit given they 
wouldn't have barred ROTC. If there 
hadn't been a war a majority of the 
faculty's support would have been 
unlikely." Brewster notes that while the 
faculty stripped ROTC's academic 
standing, it nevertheless turned down 
a resolution that would have barred it 
from campus altogether. However, as 
Brewster notes, the political climate 
surely brought the question of credit 
for ROTC to a head. 

Supporters of ROTC argue that the 
1969 decision 
was 
prompted by 
political, not academic motives. John 
Zornig, an Associate Professor in the 
Electrical Engineering Department 
and a 1966 Yale-ROTC graduate, 
believes that the faculty "made up 
reasons" to rid itself of ROTC. An ac-
tive reservist in the Army who is heavi-
ly involved with research for the 
Defense Department, 
Zornig has 
helped students obtain ROTC training 
at Bridgeport and Storrs for several 
years. "I felt embarrassment at the ir-
rationality of the· faculty's arguments," 
said Zornig. He believes the faculty felt 
that Yale had nothing to gain from 
ROTC. And since it was only the focal 
point of unpleasant political activity, 
the faculty killed ROTC in the easiest 
way possible. According to Zornig, 
"You won't have the at· 
titude that everyone In 
uniform is a monster." 

Rob Morrow 
who was a graduate student here dur-
ing the 1969 controversy, "The tenor of 
the time came from Kingman Brewster 
and he didn't want ROTC on campus 
for the same reason he wouldn't want 
anything he felt was evil on campus." 

Brewster denies this. He maintains 
that he has never had any moral 
qualms about the military or ROTC. 
He recalls the Ingalls Rink meeting of 
May, 
1969 in 
which over 2500 
members of the Yale community par-
ticipated in an open debate about the 
status of ROTC at Yale. The meeting 
ended with a 1286-1286 deadlock on 
the questions of abolishing ROTC at 
Yale. "In '69 I conducted a review of 
ROTC 
in the Rink," Brewster 
remembered. "I thought it was time we 
respected those who wanted to serve 
their country. Obviously that got lost 
in the noise." 

Brewster has been a vocal supporter 
of some kind of compulsory national 
service. He caused a stir this summer 
with an editorial he wrote for the Boston 
Globe calling for "universal public 
useful service." Many people thought 
Brewster was advocating a return to 
the draft, although he insists his pro-
posal was for something different. "It 
would have to be truly universal, and it 
wouldn't have to be military," he ex-
plained. Although Brewster certainly is 
not anti-military, he admits that he 
does not believe that ROTC merits 
academic credit. "I think people are 
free to surrender their freedom but I 
don't think they should get academic 
credit for it."
