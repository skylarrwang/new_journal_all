The Art School on trial

"In critiques students were encouraged to back stab and back bite each other and we weren 'f allowed 
to collaborate." 

Yale did not rest peacefully over winter 
vacation. In New York City a group of 
ex-teachers, 
students and alumni 
staged an exhibition of protest entitled, 
"On Trial: Yale School of Art." Some 
members of the group were under-
graduate art 
majors. 
Some were 
graduate students in painting or 
sculpture. A few graduated as early as 
the 1960s, and others left only last 
year. The show was held on Wooster 
Street in Soho and ran from December 
29 to January 8. 

Twenty-two Wooster Gallery is a 
long room with white walls and var-
nished wooden floors. It is a typical 
Soho gallery. The show was unusual 
because it featured artwork of many 
styles and forms, by over 50 different 
artists. In the rear of the room was a 
painting of a "Y," in white against a 
royal blue background. Covering part 
of the picture and curving out on the 
wall was a large red question mark. 
The painting was entitled, "You Went 
to Yale?" In the center of the room 
stood a large sculpture composed of 11 
metal spikes, rising out of a bed of

dead leaves. Posters from the Organ-
izational Drive at Yale showing sup-
port for Local 34 were exhibited on the 
front and rear walls of the gallery. The 
bond between these objects was dearly 
more political than artistic. 

The show was put together by "The 
Committee for Art," a group of about 
20 Yale-associated artists who call 
themselves aesthetic dissidents. The 
purpose of the exhibit was to speak out 
against the administration of the Yale 
School of Art, which they call "a con-
trolling elite that redirects student 
creative energy toward its own pur-
poses." The show was to them "an op-
timistic endeavor" which would "stim-
ulate the return of youthful energy and 
artistic daring." They stated that the 
School's "unbending Euro-centric ap-
proach to art and art history" was 
limiting and oppressive. Samia Hal-
aby, ex-teacher and an active leader of 
the Committee, believed that she was 
denied re-appointment last year 
because her art, influenced by her 
Palestinian background, was too inno-
vative and untraditional . for the ad-
mmtstration. Alumni on the Commit-
tee criticized the Art School's largely 
western-European approach. They 
said in many cases the approach had 
isolated them from current artistic 
trends and left them ill-prepared to 
start a career on their own. 

Small size 
What exactly are the aspects of the Art 
School which spawned this bitter and 
energetic protest? Many of the Com-
mittee's complaints may stem from the 
relatively small size of the Art School's 
administration and student popula-
tion. There are 26 teachers on the staff, 
approximately 100 graduate students 
and 60 undergraduate majors. Many 
equally 
prestigious university-con-
nected art schools are much larger than 
Yale's. Tyler, a prominent art school at 
Temple University, has about 70 full 
and part-time taculty members and 
has over 700 graduate and under-
graduate students. The School of Art 
at New York University employs 75 
teachers full time, 130 part time and 
has over 2,000 students enrolled.
