T he police officer stood between 
the two cars with crushed bumpers as 
the couple from Hong Kong fumbled 
nervously through a stack of papers in 
search of their vehicle registration 
card. When they could not find it, 
they began to panic. Although they 
could speak in broken English, they 
lapsed into unintelligible spurts. The 
officer simply could not understand 
their account of the accident. Before 
the couple grew more exasperated, an 
Asian Community Services (ACS) vol-
unteer inside Yale's Chicano/Asian 
American Cultural Center heard the 
commotion and stepped outside to 
SaPTEMBEit ... 1991 
translate for the two. 

After she 
explained the accident to the officer, 
she brought the shaken couple into the 
center for their weekly lesson. 

ACS strives to prevent such situa-
tions by easing Asian immigrants' 
transition into the New Haven com-
munity. The service provides free 
English lessons every weekend at the 
Chicano/Asian American Cultural 
Center and refers clients to bilingual 
doctors, lawyers, and other social ser-
vice providers. Nearly 50 volunteers 
from Yale and New Haven tutor Asian 
residents of the Elm C ity and nearby 
areas on a one-to-one basis. 

Asian 
American 
Students' 
Association (AASA) co-moderators 
Mary Hsu and Alberta Wu founded 
ACS in 1979 as a branch of AASA, 
and it has since become an indepen-
dent organization affiliated with 
Dwight Hall. Initially, the service pri-
marily catered to immigrants from 
Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. At the 
time, few teaching materials existed in 
the languages of those countries, so 
volunteers translated or created their 
own. 

Today, more than 13 years after 
ACS's 
creation, 
families 
from 
Southeast Asia no longer dominate the 
clientele. Instead, many of the current 
students emigrated from Hong Kong 
or China years ago and work in busi-
nesses that require little knowledge of 
English, such as Chinese restaurants. 
Some cooks and waiters at local estab-
lishments live in New York City. 
Usually m~n. they find that work is 
scarce in the metropolitan area, secure 
jobs in New Haven, and stay five or six 
days a week in apartments provided by 
their employers. Although they spend 
most of their time in New Haven, they 
maintain families in New York, which 
boasts a larger Asian community. 

During a typical lesson for these 
students, ACS volunteers teach vocab-
ulary and basic reading skills. For 
more advanced pupils, tutors explain 
the complicated connotations and 
idioms of the English language. ACS 
instructs a growing number of such 
students, who hail most frequently 
from China, Japan, and Korea. They 
attend Yale graduate programs or do 
research for the Medical School as 
post-doctoral students, and already 
have a command of English. Some are 
renowned in their native countries and 
have even published journals in 
English. They attend ACS to perfect 
their conversational skills and to learn 
the subtleties of the language. Their 
spouses often come to classes as well. 

ACS students are not the only 
ones to benefit from the service. 
·~ Tutors also appreciate the opportunity 
'! to interact with New Haven's diverse 
·r; and growing Asian population. "The 
~ structure of the program lends itself to 
(3 speaking about two cultures," explains 
Jennifer Hock (SM '94), who tutored 
the wife of a graduate student. "We 
talked about aspects of American cui-
cure, aspects of Japanese culture, and 
those common to both. 
I found 
myself speaking about what it means 
to me to be an American."
