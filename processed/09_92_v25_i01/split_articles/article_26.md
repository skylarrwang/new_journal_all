When Howard Lamar called to accept the job, the Corporation serenaded him with "Bright College Years."  For improving student relations, Lamar plans to eat meals in the colleges at least once a week, and will meet both formally and informally with student groups. "It's going to be nice to have a president who eats more meals in a college than he does at Mory's," said Suttle.


The new deans of the graduate and undergraduate schools have also adopted Lamar's accessible stance. Both Yale College Acting Dean Donald Engleman and Graduate School Dean Richard Levin claim that they will consider student concerns when making their decisions. Indeed, everyone on Lamar's administrative team has adopted a tone of approachability and consensus. "I certainly hope we have a year where we begin to work together to solve our problems, instead of having acrimonious debates," Engleman said. "We all have a common concern-the well-being of one of the world's great educational institutions."


Despite the optimism and the budding sense of community on campus, Yale's problems linger. Faced with a $15 million deficit, the university has no choice but to tighten its budget-and this may lead to deep cuts in academics, even to the elimination of some departments. "Everybody now realizes that we do need to cut back," Lamar said. But he does not want academics to bear the brunt of the budget difficulties. His administration is closely examining non-academic university operations, such as physical plant and renovation plans, for possible cuts. In the academic arena, Lamar may endorse some cuts in every department rather than major slashes in a few.


Surde points out that the budget mess will take years to resolve, and Lamar cautions that the $1.5 billion fundraising drive-which has raised $600 million to date--is not a panacea for Yale's fiscal woes. "So much of the money that Schmidt raised is in the form of pledges, wills, and gifts of material objects," Lamar said. "So when someone says, 'You've already raised $600 million,' it doesn't really mean that. We do have to cut back in places. We do have to watch our pennies."


Lamar will also need to improve Yale's image in the local and national press-an image that took quite a beating last year when the Wall Street Journal bemoaned the decline of Old Yale and The New York Times Magazine took aim at the university in a cover story. "Certain issues simply ballooned way beyond our expectations, and Yale was not prepared for this reaction," said Lamar. "We probably still have an elitist image in this country, and seeing the elite brought down is fun."


The new president is anxious to dispel this elitist image, in part by forging stronger ties between the university and New Haven. He served a term on the Board of Aldermen in the '50s, and repeatedly expresses his affection for the city. While Lamar credits Schmidt with improving the town-gown relationship, he believes that much remains to be done. He has already met with New Haven Mayor John Daniels, and claims that an announcement by the Corporation in September will lay the groundwork for a closer relationship with the city.


Like any new president, Lamar may encounter some rough spots in his administration as people adjust to the new order. To complicate matters, Engleman, Levin, and Provost Judith Rodin have all just assumed their posts, and Lamar and Engleman are temporary. "There's bound to be some confusion," said Kate Baicker (BK '93), Yale College Council President. "Building a relationship takes time."


But Levin points out that all members of Lamar's new team have served together in the past on university committees. "The idea that somehow this is a team that by virtue of being new, is in danger of making mistakes, is not valid at all," Engleman claimed. "We all have extensive administrative experience. Judy Rodin, Rick Levin and myself were on the restructuring committee, and we spent the better part of two years looking at every department in the university."


Lamar himself possesses more successful administrative experience than just about any of his colleagues. Faculty members still fondly recall 1979 to 1985, when Lamar served as Dean of Yale College. "It's extremely rare for someone to emerge from the deanship and not have a single enemy in the place," Russett said. Under Lamar's leadership, Yale College standardized its tenure procedures, revamped the student disciplinary committee, and developed the Women's Studies and Studies in the Environment programs. Lamar lists the latter two programs as his greatest accomplishments while dean. "'d like to see a university that explores new ideas, that thinks the unthinkable, that anticipates what the major issues will be not just for the university, but for society as a whole," he said.


Though Engleman jokes that many faculty wished Lamar could have stayed dean forever, by 1985 Lamar wanted to return to his first loves, teaching and research. He came to Yale in 1945 as a graduate student, and except for a few fellowships, he has never left. For decades Lamar taught History of the American West, leaving his mark on the field through his writing and by guiding dozens of graduate students who went on to reinterpret the mythology of the West. "Lamar is sort of the father of a lot of important Western historians," said Bryce Nelson, a scholar of the American West at the University of Southern California. "He taught them to look at the non-idyllic side of Western history. And besides being such a great figure, he's regarded as gracious, warm and benevolent. He's out to help other people, not just himself, and that's not always common in academia."


Lamar's good nature may be severely tested in the coming year, as constituencies compete for his attention and the university's budget woes continue. But for now he seems perfectly content in Woodbridge Hall, and the Corporation is in no hurry to replace him. "Having a person of Howard Lamar's ability serve as acting president means that there is no reason to rush into making a permanent selection until we have found the right person," said Boren. "The choice of the next permanent Yale president is a critical one that will in many ways determine Yale's place in the next century."


As the Corporation ponders the future, Lamar relishes the present. "He's in incredibly good spirits," said Suttle of his old friend. "This is his last contribution to a community he has been such a vital part of since 1945. He's dedicated his life to the Yale and New Haven communities. He just cares so much for the place." At least at this stage of his presidency, the feeling is mutual. Kathy Rich, a senior in Pierson College, is editor-in-chief of TNJ.
