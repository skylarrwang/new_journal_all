When several tenured professors at SOM threatened to resign over philosophical differences about the curriculum, Schmidt responded by appointing a new dean, Michael Levine, whom he charged with changing the school's emphasis on non-profit management to a more traditional, corporate-oriented curriculum. 

Schmidt granted the new dean unlimited power to hire and fire non-tenured faculty, and Levine summarily axed two of the school's major departments. Schmidt's authoritarian tactics shocked many faculty members and students, regardless of how they felt about the changes. Because SOM was founded in the late '70s, disgruntled alumni lacked the numbers to take the protest further. 

Schmidt stirred further controversy when, on budgetary grounds, he shut down the *Yale Review*, one of the oldest and most highly regarded literary journals in the country. As in the battle at SOM, many felt that Schmidt was allowing business concerns to supersede the scholarly mission of the university. But unlike SOM, the *Review* had a powerful constituency-the literati, headed by author George Plimpton. The group pressured Schmidt relentlessly and eventually forced him to reverse his decision.


**Title: Yale-New Haven Agreement and Fundraising**
**Page number(s): 22-23**

In contrast to the flak Schmidt took for his actions at SOM and the *Yale Review*, he received high praise in the Yale community for his dealings with New Haven's government. The signing of the Yale-New Haven agreement ranks foremost among his accomplishments. Under the agreement, Schmidt pledged that for the first time in its 291 year history, Yale would make payments to the city government in lieu of taxes. Other major universities had made such concessions to local governments long before. Princeton gives $2 million annually to the municipal government, while Stanford pays nearly $5 million for fire protection alone. 

The deal almost collapsed when conservatives on the Board of Aldermen challenged the section of the agreement that gave Yale the right to close four blocks of High and Wall Streets to traffic in exchange for $1.1 million. But with concessions on all sides, the Board finally accepted Schmidt's package. "I think that he was more successful in improving Yale's relationship with the New Haven community than any of the three presidents who came before him," said Joseph LaPalombara, a political science professor. 

As a fund raiser, Schmidt also beat out his predecessors. The numbers speak for themselves: $150 million raised last year alone as the nucleus for the upcoming capital campaign, a record yearly take for the university. Like Giamatti, Schmidt improved alumni donations totals every year he held office. 

Yale Presidents have been preoccupied with the endowment ever since its real value collapsed after the failure of several risky investment during Kingman Brewster's administration. Additionally, Brewster left Giamatti and Schmidt a decaying physical plant that would cost an estimated $1.2 billion to repair-Giamatti had once joked to *The New York Times* that his presidency would be remembered only for the "Giamatti Memorial Wiring System." To help offset the mounting costs of renovations, Schmidt began to travel extensively for a new capital campaign, the largest ever conducted by an American university. "The private part of a capital campaign-securing a nucleus fund-requires the presence of the president," said Charles Pagnam, director of major gifts. 

But while Schmidt crisscrossed the globe as Yale's chief fund raiser, the taunt "Where's Benno?" grew more audible in New Haven. And Schmidt's low popularity benefitted little from the money pouring into the endowment, since most of the new funds had to pay for mundane items such as roof repairs and bathroom renovations. 

Schmidt undermined his success at raising large amounts of money by alienating large numbers of active Yale alumni. His unpopularity stemmed from his emphasis on gaining large, high-profile donations like the $60 million given by the Bass family last year. Off the record, many attribute Schmidt's triumphs in this area to his patrician upbringing: the Basses and the Whitneys were on Schmidt's Rolodex long before he became Yale's president. "I know, through officers in the university, that Schmidt saw no reason to be bothered by any dealings with alumni except for the true plutocrats," said William Henry III (BK '71), a theater critic for *Time* magazine. "If you weren't talking about someone who could write at least a seven if not an eight figure check, he just didn't see any reason. That could be handled by underlings in the Development Office." 

Schmidt's aloof personal manner offended many alumni audiences ... He was essentially unwilling to mingle... said Henry. "Among alumni he was notorious for not being there even when he was there. He didn't take questions, he wouldn't engage in small talk, and he really didn't listen to anybody." 

The speeches that Schmidt gave to Yale alumni meetings were widely derided by audiences as boring and ineffective. Andrea Dorfman (PC '84) recalls hearing Schmidt at the Yale Club in New York: "I have to say I thought Benno Schmidt was one of the worst speakers I have ever heard. I found him dull. I found that he didn't really have an understanding of the workings of a university."


**Title: Schmidt's Last Year and Fiscal Crisis**
**Page number(s): 24**

In his last year as president, Schmidt managed to alienate many students, university employees, and professors as well. After a series of annual budget deficits culminated in a projected $15 million shortfall for 1992, Schmidt declared that the university was in fiscal crisis. At the same time, Yale was negotiating a new contract with the University's dining hall and custodial employees. Schmidt's administration claimed that the budget crisis made new concessions impossible. The unions joined forces with a group of graduate students to push for recognition of the Graduate Employee and Student Organization (GESO). When negotiations stalled, GESO and Locals 34 and 35 staged a three-day strike. 

While labor troubles brewed, Schmidt, Yale College Dean Donald Kagan, and Provost Frank Turner interpreted the recurring debt as an indication that the university needed to concentrate its resources in fewer areas. Schmidt appointed a committee of professors to devise a plan to restructure the university's academic departments and slash the budget by 15 percent. "In my 28 years at Yale I had never known anything comparable to the degree of malaise this procedure created," said LaPalombara. "The process was simply mishandled. There was absolutely no finesse." 

When the committee finally recommended an across-the-board cut in faculty positions, as it axed two departments and emasculated several others, the faculty went into full revolt. Professors formed their own committee to evaluate the conclusions of the restructuring report, calling on Howard Lamar, the highly-respected former Dean of Yale College, to head the group. Lamar's review committee eventually found that the magnitude of the "budget crisis" had been exaggerated. The review committee offered several alternative plans to the one proposed by Schmidt's restructuring committee.
