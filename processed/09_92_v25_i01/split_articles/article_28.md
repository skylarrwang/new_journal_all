he "Gag Rule" has forced 
Planned Parenthood· of 
Connecticut (PPC) to reex-
amine its values. The 1987 federal 
regulation, upheld by the Supreme 
Court in 199 1; prevents govern-
ment-funded health care profes-
sionals from discussing abortion 
with clients-an integral part of 
PPC's self-defined mission. The 
organization, which runs 20 clinics 
and treats 54,000 women each year, 
stands to lose $500,000 annually in 
federal funds. Yet despite the reces-
sion that has crippled the health 
care industry, PPC officials have 
decided to defY the government and 
remain true to the organization's 
pro-choice principles. 

The disputed funds fall under 
the Family Planning Services and 
Population Research Act or Title X 
of the Public Health Service Act 
(1970), which subsidizes treatment 
for ~omen who can pay little or 
nothing for care. "Women who 
seek medical care at Title X clinics 
are women who, without subsidies, 
may do without care-and surely 
without birth control-if there is 
no food on the table at home," said 
Patricia Baker, executive director of 
PPC. Since PPC offers abortion 
counseling and procedures, it is 
now ineligible for Title X funds. 

Although a last-minute modifi-
cation of the Title X "Gag Rule" 
provision allows physicians to offer 
limited advice on abortion, Baker 
fears that the new law will still have 
disastrous consequences for low-
income women. "We will see a two-
tiered system of health care infor-
mation in this country--one where 
pregnant women with the financial 
resources will continue to be fully 
32. THE N£w JouRNAL 
informed of all available alternatives 
while those who cannot afford private 
physicians will suffer," she said. 

Women's health organizations 
must fight the Bush Administration 
and the religious 
right 
for 
every 
Federal, state, and 
local 
dollar. 
According to a New 
Haven 
Advocate 
investigation, the 
major women's clin-
ics in New Haven-
Women's 
Health 
Services 
(WHS) 
and PPC-receive 
less in federal subsi-
dies than neighbor-
hood clinics that 
provide 
general 
care, although they 
treat comparable 
numbers of low-
income patients. 

Government grants 
constitute 64 per-
cent of Hill Health 
Center 
revenue, 
while public dollars 
comprise only 21 
percent of PPC and 
eight percent of 
WHS 
budgets. 

Between 1980 and 
1990, allotments in 
the federal budget 
for Title X plunged 
by two-thirds, from 
$153 million to $51 
million. 

And 
because PPC and 
Hartford Hospital 
will not comply 
stands to lose half of the $1.2 million 
in Title X funds annually allocated to 
the state.

WH$, attributes the lack of federal 
supporr to the misperception that 
women's clinics primarily perform 
abortions. In reality, clinics like WHS 
and PPC offer a comprehensive repro-
ductive health program, including 
contraceptive counseling and meth-
ods, pregnancy testing, sexually- trans-
mitted disease testing, breast exams, 
annual pelvic exams, and Pap smears. 

Although Connecticut, like most 
states, lacks the resources to replace 
lost federal dollars, state legislators 
have tried to pick up some of the slack. 
In 1991 the state legislature approved 
half of the $500,000 that Governor 
Lowell Weicker originally proposed for 
family planning and also passed a law 
that codified a woman's right to priva-
cy. Furthermore, nearly all members of 
the Connecticut congressional aelega-
tion 
h~tve endorsed the federal 
Freedom of Choice Act, which would 
legalize the right to abortion. 

To replace the rest of the Title X 
money, PPC and WHS have tried to 
tap the private resources of individu-
als, foundations, and corporations. 
"We've received a good response to our 
fundraising campaign and will make 
ends meet this year," said Ilene Shub, a 
PPC spokesperson. "But now we need 
to worry about the following year and 
the year after that. It's a continual 
effort." Administrators will only con-
sider raising medical fees as a last 
resort. 

T
he rising cost of medication 
and supplies poses a further 
financial dilemma for PPC 
and WHS. Federal legislation that 
requires pharmaceutical companies to 
give rebates to state Medicaid pro-
grams forced these companies to cut 
back discounts traditionally granted 
to subsidized health care providers. 
Consequently, birth control prices 
have skyrocketed. From 1990 to 
1991, the average cost of birth control 
pills rose by 35 percent-from $16.99 
to $22.95 for a one-month supply. 

New legislation also requires certifica-
tion of lab technicians who read Pap 
smears. As a result, the cost of these 
cervical cancer tests has quadrupled, 
from $3 to $12. 

P
atient fees constitute the back-
bone of PPC and WHS bud-
gets, but the recession has driv-
en more and more low-income 
patients to these clinics. Five years 
ago WHS treated about one-third 
full-paying, one-third Medicaid, and 
one-third sliding fee patients, but 
today the clinic sees fewer full-paying 
women than ever and 40 percent of its 
patients are on Medicaid. "Women 
come here who live in extreme pover-
ty and in situations of real terror," said 
Bonnie Rapkin, a clinic social worker 
who is a therapist and abortion coun-
selor at WHS. "They spend their days 
below windows to avoid random gun-
fire and occasionally venture outside 
with their infant child to get to the 
bus stop." 

Although clinics like WHS focus 
on serving low-income patients, many 
women who can afford private care 
also patronize them. "We have always 
had a group of women who could 
afford care elsewhere," said Rapkin. "I 
see many college students, women 
from the surrounding suburbs, and 
powerful women from the corporate 
world. They come here because we 
provide a more woman-oriented envi-
ronment where they are treated as 
people rather than as bodies rolling 
through." 

As PPC and WHS attract more 
women, the clinics are developing ser-
vices in areas other than gynecology. 
"Many women feel comfortable with 
the health care professionals and coun-
selors at the clinic, so they come here 
first with their health problems," said 
Ada Spann, site manager of PPC's 
Griswold-Buxton clinic in New 
Haven. "We try to make health care as 
accessible as possible and adapt to our 
patients' needs." WHS offers body 
image and eating disorder therapy 
along with psychotherapy. Certain 
PPC clinics offer screenings for dia-
betes, sickle-cell anemia, high blood 
pressure, and high cholesterol. 

By broadening their original mis-
sion, PPC and WHS hope to change 
their public image and possibly win 
back federal funding. Spann predicts 
that PPC will expand women's health 
services beyond gynecology and per-
haps embrace a more general health-
care role for all family members. A 
long-range planning committee at 
WHS is currently considering a move 
into primary health care for women. 

In light of the new interest in women's 
health research, Huettner also believes 
that the clinics could grow by serving 
as a site for Yale research sponsored by 
government grants. 

Although funding may be shaky, 
administrators see expansion as. a vital 
necessity. "Women teU me about trying 
to get health care in a private setting 
where they sense an uncaring and inat-
tentive attitude," Rapkin said. "I think 
it's clear what women want. We a.s a 
society should be able to do better." ..
