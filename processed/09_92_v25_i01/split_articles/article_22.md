members of the 1 02nd Regiment and 
students, including many war veterans, exchanged insults. "At one o'clock 
a.m. the next morning about 400 soldiers and sailors went to the campus 
and invited the students out. Nothing 
but deep silence on the students' part 
prevailed,'! reported the New Haven 
Union. "The soldiers formed a skirmish 
line and charged ... Then came a 
shower of books, shoes, bottles, and 
bricks from the students., The fight 
broke up only after police arrived. 
The 1919 affair was the last of the 
Yale-New Haven riots, but it also 
marked the end of two decades of 
remarkably cordial relations between 
the city and the college. By the early 
1920s, the town-gown honeymoon 
had fizzled. And while New Haven 
slid into the Great Depression, Yale 
began building its ostentatious Gothic 
towers, symbolizing the ever-widening 
gulf between city and ivory tower. 


"There are only a few Yale men so 
besotted that they see much beauty in 
the location of our college buildings," 
lamented Robert Dudley French '1 0 in 
1929. "There is probably not one of us 
who does not think with some regret 
what Yale might have been, if foreseeing 
wisdom had been given to the 
directors of our destiny., 


But the lack of such "wisdom" has 
not prevented Yale and New Haven 
from maturing together throughout a 
century in which both have experienced 
fundamental changes. In the 
1960s, New Haven's Great Society 
programs and the emergence of a more 
socially-conscious and diverse university 
created two communities with 
shared interests and aspirations. 
President Kingman Brewster's decision 
to open Yale's facilities to the 
protesting public during the May Day 
Black Panther trials of 1970 indicated 
a new attitude toward the Elm City. 
And despite Jonathan Einhorn's recent 
election rhetoric, graduate students, 
bursary students, and community 
members of Locals 34 and 35 cooperated 
in the 1992 winter strike against 
Yale itself. While the university 
administration may find such behavior 
irritating, the recent coalition 
shows that the people of Yale and 
New Haven may have finally buried 
the hatchet.
