or the ten to fifteen per~ent of undergraduates wh~ 
hail from the southern United States, a Yale education 
includes a number of lessons that aren't listed in the 
Blue Book. For many, the real test comes not -in Intro 
Psych, but from the stereotypes fellow students carry about 
Southern culture and beliefs. 

Mary Tobler (DC '95) of Richmond, Virginia found 
that many Yale students view "the South" as an unknown 
land somewhere in the boonies. Tobler spent much of her 
first year at Yale discussing Dixie with curious Yankees. 
"For so many people up here my being from the South was 
such a rarity that I constantly found myself talking about 
it," she said. 

Tobler found some outdated stereotypes almost laugh-
able. ''A lot of people thought that I'd be sweet and demure, 
a belle who was easy to push around, and definitely not a 
feminist," she said. "It was surprising to a lot of people that 
I could speak articulately, and that I had deep thoughts." 

Southerners can laugh off such flawed assumptions, 
but defusing peers' suspicions about racism proves a more 
daunting task. "I had a hard time with people freshman 
year because they had very strange ideas about the South," 
said Columbus, Georgia native Nam Cho (PC '93). "Some 
students thought Southerners were still lynching people. It 
made me mad because I was very open-minded about the 
North." Hyman Rubin III (SM '93) of South Carolina also 
found Yale rife with unfair generalizations. "Of course, peo-
ple expect anybody from the South to be a racist," he said. 

Southerners find Yankee gibes about the Civil War 
especially irksome. "I was made to feel ashamed of it, but 
on the other hand, I had nothing to do with it," said 
Tobler. "It's like bringing up the Revolutionary War to 
someone from Britain." 

When discussions turn to history and race, Southerners 
wonder why Northerners judge the South by standards they 
themselves fail to maintain. "I've seen a lot of racial tension 
in the North,.and it always confuses me why the South has 
such a bad reputation," said Cho. "Things don't seem much 
better here. Historically there have been lots of racial prob-
lems, but I think people in the South tend to be more hon-
est about them." Deesha Philyaw (PC '93), an African-
American, did not find that Northern rhetoric about race 
.. 
relations matched the reality. "The South has problems and 
prejudices, but it wasn't like this place was much warmer," 
she said. 

ican-American Southerners face a different kind of 
xperience at Yale. Philyaw found that exposure to 
ortherners changed her perceptions about the 
black community. "I learned that black people are not a 
monolith," she said. "It was great to see black people from 
other parts of the country who had other religions, or no 
religion at all, or who were from different countries." 

Southerners of all races no~ice cultural gaps between 
New Haven and Dixie, especially when it comes to atti-
tudes. Senator David L. Boren (CC '63), Democrat from 
Oklahoma and Yale Corporation Trustee, believes that
