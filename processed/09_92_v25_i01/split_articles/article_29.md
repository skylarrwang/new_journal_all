uring a 1989 conference on 
the transition to democracy in 
Argentina, the Yale Law 
School's Orville H. Schell Jr. Center 
for International Human Rights 
expanded the traditional definition of 
human rights by including the coun-
try's economic situation in its discus-
sions. The issue: Can there be protec-
tion for human rights when the econo-
my is experiencing 1,000 percent 
inflation and people are breaking into 
supermarkets just to get enough food 
to survive? The question seemed 
worlds away from the standard con-
cerns that most numan rights groups 
address-political persecution and 
imprisonment. Yet in the context of 
the Schell Center's conference on 
Argentina, economic well-being 
proved as crucial a right as free speech. 

Schell Center founders Drew 
Days III and George Andreopoulos, 
both Yale Law School professors, seek 
to ensure that "second generation" 
human rights, such as the right to eco-
nomic survival, are not forgotten in 
the quest for an international human 
rights standard. "If you want to under-
stand human rights in a more compre- · 
hensive way, talk about the quality of 
life of the individual, not just whether 
the individual can be left free from 
persecution, arbitrary arrest, and tor-
ture," said Andreopoulos. 

To address such issues, the Schell 
Center has adopted an interdisci-
plinary approach to the study of 
human rights. Center activities 
include conferences like the one on 
Argentina, student and faculty 
research, and publications. "Protection 
for individual rights and what we call 
human right$ can't really exist in a vac-
uum," said Days. "There has to be 
some sense of what the cultural con-

what economic conditions are." 

Establis·hing this context has 
required close work with experrs out-
side the Law School-a unique prac-
tice among university-based, research-
oriented human rights centers. The 
Schell Center's advisory committee, 
which approves all major projects, 
draws its members not just from the 
Law School, but from the history and 
political science departments, the 
Divinity School, the Medical School, 
the 
School 
of 
Forestry 
and 
Environmental Studies, and the 
School of Epidemiology and Public 
Health. This year's upcoming confer-
ence on che transition to democracy in 
the Phi!ippines boasts a roster of over 
20 speakers, including historians, con-
stitutional theorists, military experts, 
political scientists, and economists. 

Days and Andreopoulos gave 
though~ao the potential for publica-
tion when they chose the Philippines 
as their topic. "UsuaJiy we don't get 
involved in a big project unless we 
have a pretty good feeling that it may 
result in 
a 
publication," said 
Andreopoulos. "Our first considera-
tion is, 'What are the chances we have 
something new to say?"' T he center's 
advisory committee believed that chis 
year's election in the Philippines pro-
vided such new material. The Middle 
East's recent turn in the media spot-
light has earned Islam consideration as 
the topic of the Schell Center's second 
major conference this year. 

The Schell Center sponsors ongo-
ing, original research as well as events 
at Yale. To spark an interest in human 
rights among graduate students, the 
Center provides financial support for 
human rights-oriented research each 
summer. Recent projects have includ-
ed studies of violence against women 
in South Africa and the economic

plight of Palestinians in Israel's occu-
pied territories. The latter resulted in 
the Schell Center's first book, 
P/owshar~s and Swords: Th~ Economic 
Occupation in th~ Wt-st Bank. The cen-
ter also sponsors scholars from other 
institutions who wish to research 
human rights at Yale. 

T
he Schell Center's rapid rise to 
prominence since its founding 
in 1989 has surpassed even the 
expectations of its directors. Its roots 
lie with Orville Schell, a New York 
City attorney who worked for the 
human rights organizations Helsinki 
Watch and Americas Watch. After 
Schell's death in 1987, a group of his 
friends and associates established the 
center in his memory. Days, an 
Assistant Attorney General for Civil 
Rights during the Caner administra-
tion, agreed to direct the center. 
Andreopoulos, who came aboard as 
associate director, brought personal 
experience to his post. As a child, he 
lived through a seven-year military dic-
tatorship in Greece that practiced 
widespread torture and persecution. 
Andreopoulos moved to the United 
States in 1973, where he joined the 
Committee 
for 
Freedom 
Democracy in Greece. 

Days and Andreopoulos tailored 
the center's goals to complement the 
work of the Lowenstein Project, a stu-
dent group in the Law School that 
focuses on the legal aspects of human 
rights. But only in the past year has the 
Schell Center attracted attention from 
undergraduates. Days and Andreo-
poulos attribute the rise in interest to 
the new human rights course they 
te.ach at Yale College, and to recent 
cooperation between the center and 
the undergraduate Amnesty Inter-
national chapter. The two groups co-
sponsored a successful conference on 
human rights in China last April. Last 
semester also saw the first issue of the 
Ya/~ journal of Human Rights, an 
undergraduate 
publication 
that 
Andrepoulos advises. T his year, the 
Schell Center will sponsor a bi-weekly 
faculty seminar on redefining security.

ronment, the economy, and other non-
standard human rights issues. "We're 
trying to move away from the military 
paradigm," said Days. 

Although its present scope is con-
siderable, the Schell Center seeks to 
broaden its influence. 
Although 
humanities specialists dominate audi-
ences at its events, the center has begun 
to target the natural science depart-
ments and the Medical School. Two 
years ago the center sponsored a con-
ference on medicine and torture, and it 
is planning one on organ transplants 
and human rights for later this year. 

Expanding programs and growing 
audiences have not swayed the Schell 
Center from its original course. "It's 
really about making people aware, talk-
ing about interdisciplinary issues, and 
making scholars," said Days. "We're 
making discussion about human rights 
effective and intelligent instead of just 
rhetoric."
