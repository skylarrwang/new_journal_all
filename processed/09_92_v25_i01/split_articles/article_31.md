Southerners' small numbers can place them at a disadvan-
tage. "At first the university has for most of us a cultural 
strangeness that can be intimidating,'' he said. Students 
must make a special effort to adjust. "People aren't as 
friendly here," said Philyaw. "There is a coldness, and I've 
had to steel myself against it." 

Of all the Southern stereotypes, Southerners' fabled 
politeness rings most true. This can cause problems for 
some exiles in New Haven. "In the North it's no great sign 
of disrespect if you walk past someone and they don't say 
hello," said Rubin. "Whereas down South it means that 
they want to kill you." And some Southerners find the 
chilly Northern sryle downright offensive. "The women at 
Wawa really offended me when I first got there-they 
threw my change at me," Cho said. "I know it's a stereo-
type, but people are just more polite in Georgia." 

For many Southern students who grow up far from the 
prep schools of the Northeast, the path to Yale is a 
long and uphill climb. ''I'd never heard of any Ivy 
League schools before my junior year," said Bob Battle (SY 
'92). "My parents got me to apply, but the more I read 
about it, the more I wanted to go. You can't pass up an 
opportunity to get the education you can get at Yale." 

Battle dealt with Old Blue culture shock by taking 
action. Spurred by the idea that a support group could ease 
the transition to Yale, he ferreted out other undergraduates 
and graduate students from his home state and founded the 
Alabama Club. Originally, Battle envisioned the club main-
ly as a social group. "I thought it might be a nice idea to 
have a group that got together once a month to eat a few 
grits or maybe talk in our Southern accents a little bit," he 
quipped. 

Senator Boren never misses a chance to check on stu-
dents from Oklahoma when he comes to town for 
Corporation business. His visits provide the nucleus for a 
very informal "Oklahoma Club." Twice a year, Boren treats 
Oklahomans to an Old Blue tradition-lunch at Mory's. 
"It's just fun to be with people who think it's perfectly nor-
mal to eat okra and be 'foon' to go to the library to study," 
explained Boren. "One nf the reasons why I keep up with 
the Oklahoma students is that I have never forgotten the 
feelings of insecurity and homesickness that I felt when I 
first came to Yale." 

The Alabama Club goes further and recruits new mem-
bers by writing to prospective students from Alabama and 
offering to house them during their visits to Yale. The 
annual calendar includes a summer party to welcome 
incoming freshmen and a back-to-school parry in the fall. 
Such events provide Southerners with a taste of home that 
many long for. 

Alabama's negative image, based on lingering memories 
of the state's violent reaction to the civil rights movement, 
touches a nerve with Battle and other club members. Last 
year, the club set out to improve its state's reputation on 
campus. With donations from Alabaman alums, the club 
co-sponsored a Saybrook College Master's Tea with Federal 
District Judge Myron Thompson (Yale '69 Law '72). Battle 
saw Thompson, an Alabaman and an African-American, as 
the perfect choice "to talk about the changes that have 
taken place in the heart of Dixie." Over fifty people 
attended the function, and the club hopes to bring another 
prominent Alabaman to campus this year. 

Alabama's image will acquire new luster this year in 
other ways as well. When the resignation of President 
Benno Schmidt left Yale rudderless, the Corporation 
named history professor and native Alabaman Howard 
Lamar (see related story, p. 26) as Acting President. Amid 
jokes that their "Alabama Cabal" 
would subvert Yale's Yankee heritage, 
Lamar named a fellow Alabaman, 
Associate Provost Lloyd Suttle, to the 
post of Advisor to the President. 

Lamar 
does 
not 
share 
other 
Southerners' uneasiness with Yale. 
"From the first moment I came here, I 
felt at home," he said. "A lot of fellow 
Southerners never felt comfortable 
here, but I just responded to it." Not 
since the days of John C. Calhoun and 
Eli Whitney has Dixie wielded such 
clout on campus. 

Southerners who survive four 
years of Yale face a choice: 
whether or not to return to their 
native region. Many feel that their 
education confers a special responsi-
bility. "I hope that students from our 
region will decide one day to return 
home and try to make a difference in 
their communities. I have tried to do 
that," said Boren. "There is such a 
need to demonstrate the importance 
of high standards of excellence in edu-
cation. 

The Alabama Club has taken on 
the mission of encouraging native sons 
and daughters to come home. "A lot 
of talented Southerners go up to 
Northeastern schools and then turn 
their backs on the South," said Battle. 
"They make a fast buck and act kind 
of embarrassed about the history of 
the South. We hope to build some sort 
of camaraderie among the students 
from Alabama and make them feel 
like they should come back and help 
solve the problems of the state." 

For most Southern students, how-
ever, the journey from home to Yale 
and back remains a long and winding 
road. "Of course your family worries 
that going North is going to change 
you," Philyaw said. "It's just worlds 
apart, and there's always the question 
of loyalty." 

Jay Porter, a sophomore in Davenport 
College, is production manager of TNJ.
