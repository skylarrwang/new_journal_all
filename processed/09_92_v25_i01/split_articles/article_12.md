EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The Chinese have a favorite curse: "May you live in interesting 
times." Those of us who study and teach at Yale right now can 
certainly appreciate the meaning of those words. All around us, 
the debate swirls about the future of the American university. How can 
Yale stay in the black, yet continue to offer a multifaceted education 
that tackles the problems of our constantly changing world? And who 
will lead us imo the 21st century? 

In our special issue last February, The New Journal asked the 
question: "What does the future hold for Yale?" We examined the 
university's tenure and restructuring process, several of its academic 
departments, and its relations with New Haven. As the new semester 
begins, some of the turbulence is behind us. We have a new 
administration char intends to heal the rift berween community and 
Woodbridge Hall. In our kick-off issue of 1992-93, we try to illuminate 
these developments, and explore off-the-beaten-track aspects of campus 
life--everything from Southern students at Yale to the awakening band 
scene. 

The New Journal's scope also encompasses the vibrant and 
complicated city in which we live. This month we tackle New Haven's 
low-income housing crisis, the funding crunch in women's health care, 
and the bloody history of town-gown relations. 

You too can gee in the on the action. The New Journal is 
looking for writers, designers, photographers, artists, computer whizzes, 
and financial geniuses for our business staff. Join us at our 
organizational meeting on Tuesday, September 8th at 8 p.m. in the 
Berkeley Common Room. We want to hear your ideas.
