When you think "Yale," images of electric guitars, 
narc drums, and smoke-filled stages don't usually come to mind. But while the campus is no 
musical mecca, Yale did see the birth of several new groups 
in 1992, as some old favorites marched on. New Haven 
and Yale collaborations also helped resuscitate the once-
floundering music scene. "The stork of reason has delivered 
the brainchild of the Yale music scene," declared Austin 
Troy (PC '92), music junkie and bass guitarist. 

Be wary of such optimism, considering that it comes 
from a performer who has been known to toss radishes into 
the audience during renditions of songs with titles like 
Cooki~ in th~ Middi~. Not all of us share Troy's opinion that 
Yale's music world is "ready to renaissance." Avoiding the 
same old same old of cover bands and their endless rendi-
tions of "Freebird" will take more student support and a lit-
tle help from the Yale administration. 

Magnolia Rifles, a country music band, braved the 
storm of the last couple of years, when a plethora of 
promising bands fizzled into nothing. The group's concep-
tion was a simple matter of aesthetics. "I went up to (vocal-
ist) George Streeter (SY '94) at a literary magazine meeting, 
complimented him on his sideburns and asked if he liked 
Kris Kristofferson," explained mandolin player Dima 
Chapman (BR '94). That night they got together and 
learned "Night Moves," and after the first fateful jam ses-
sion, the two crooned and strummed their way to country 
band-dom. When guitarists Cole Wicker (TC '94) and 
Geoffrey Boyd (TC '94) joined, the Rifles evolved into two 
guys with acoustics, a mandolin player, and a man with a 
mike ready to emote about wine, women, butterbeans, or 
possibly the plight of the Yale University Dining Hall worker. The repertoire soon expanded to include covers of 
Neil Young and Jerry Jeff Walker, as well as the inevitable 
"Gambler" and the Dukes of Hazzard theme song. 

Trumbull's Boiler Room became the Magnolia Rifles' home 
turf with many a cowboy hat in sight. 

The Rifles don't get to play as often as they would like. 
Student employment schedules have made practice and gig 
time almost as hard to come by as a Yale rap or hip-hop act 
(but that's another kettle of fish). And money for equip-
ment rental is also a headache. Members hope that Sudler 
Fund money will soon pour in so that the Yale community 
will not be deprived of a show where fringed shirts and 
cowboy boots are the outfits of choice. 

The band Schwa is looking for moral as well as mone-
tary support. With guitarist Tim Power's (SM '94) riffs,

Scott Foster's (SM '93) vocals, slapping bass by Marthane 
Sanders (SM '92), and solid accordion accompaniment 
from Joe Carroll (SM '92), the group offers up original 
songs with a distinctive sound. Even with the significant 
amount of recognition that Schwa enjoyed last year, the 
band sometimes met a tepid Yale reaction. "People still 
don't take bands seriously here," lamented Power. "Original 
music is just not that big a thing." Student apathy takes its 
toll, and when the band members outnumber the audience 
on occasion, potential new vitality sputters and dies. 

The pitiful dearth of performance space at Yale also 
reflects student unwillingness to boogie out of the 
weenie bins and into the groove of live concerts. 
Pierson College's B-11, which once hosted many a musical 
jam, fell victim to such indifference. Last year the college 
used it for storage instead of shows. Even when it was still 
an outlet for artistic expression, B-11 was too hot, in the 
wrong sense of the word. When BLA, Pierson's own basic 
rock cover band, played one of the last B-11 shows in 
January 1991, the oppressive heat drove audience members 
from the show before the end of the first set. 

Most Bulldog bands now fight over the Trumbull 
Boiler Room, the Silliman Dramatic Attic, and residential 
college common rooms when they want to perform for 
more than just their closest friends. Some turn to the frat

parry scene: Red Herring, a variation of last year's Quick 
Brown Fox, appeared often at DKE last year. For less tra-
ditional bands, however, the parcy scene doesn't lend itself 
to performances. Members of Wrench, the Yale trio that 
was originally to be called Please Kill Yourself, complained 
that party audiences have short attention spans. 

Apparently after a few kegs, partiers need the familiarity 
of Rolling Stones covers to orient themselves. 

If it's hard to find a place to perform here, the search 
for a practice room taxes even the most resourceful. 
Warehouse, known for .its original songs, soulful singing, 
and funky bass, struck a deal with Berkeley Master Harry 
Stout to use the college's practice room, but only' if the 
band included two Berkeley natives. So Warehouse tai-
lored the band to include the correct number of 
Bcrkeleyites, and they got the space they needed. If only 
the life of a Yale musician was always so simple. 

Even the legitimate places to practice on campus leave 
much to be desired. Last year the Barnyard Blues Band 
tried to share practice space in Jonathan Edwards College 
with Monobrau, to the distress of all involved. "Trying to 
fit a drummer, two guitarists, a keyboard player, a singer, 
and a guy with a harmonica into that place ain't a piece of 
cake," moaned lead guitarist Thad Brown (SM '92). Since 
many practice rooms are far from sound-proof, Yale 
frowns on bands that dare to be non-a capella, or worse-
amplified. For now, bands can practice in Jonathan 
Edwards, but that privilege may not last forever. "I don't 
think the room is really soundproof-
it's just that no 
one's been complaining lately," said Master's assistant 
Barbara Goddard. 

Big Drummer on Campus Steve Platt (ES '93), who 
plays with Notes From the Underground, one of 
the better known Yale rock cover bands, has a dif-
ferent kind of complaint. "Drummers and bassists are 
pretty hard to find," he said. Since the number of musi-
cians on campus remains limited, Yale performers now 
collaborate with New Haven players to form bands like 
The Crossing and VMJ. Joint entertainment efforts that 
feature groups from Yale and New Haven, like the event 
in the Silliman Dramatic attic last year that featured the 
Gravel Pit, VMJ, and Drastic Yellow Plastic, herald a 
bright spot on the horizon for Yale's music scene. 

April's PARTAY (Pierson Alcoholics Responsibly 
Trashed All Year) concert depended on a town-gown 
meeting of musical minds. The Old Campus jam fea-
tured Yale bands Drastic Yellow Plastic, Schwa, and 
Magnolia Rifles, as well as New Haven's Blind Justice and 
Children of the Sun. PARTAY presented a wide array of 
music, from the limbo-inspiring African beats of 
Children of the Sun to the almost-heavy metal sound of 
Skorn Flakes.

accounts, Tim Power pleaded with audience mempers to 
support local music. With a bit more effort on the part 
of the student body, perhaps Yale could make up for 
what it lacks in sex and drugs by offering some rock and 
roll.
