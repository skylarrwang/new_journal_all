EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The New journal is the biggest and arguably (we have to say that to be modest) the best 
publication on campus. Two years ago the Columbia Scholastic Press Association ranked TN] 
among the top nine college magazines in America. Rolling Stone gave us the big-thumbs up, 
too. Last year, TN] writers won the two highest journalism prizes awarded at Yale. If you want 
to work in an environment where talent is appreciated and nurtured, TN] is for you. Maybe 
someday you'll follow in the footsteps of staff members like these: Jack Fuller, now editor of 
the Chicago Tribune; Anne Applebaum, now Warsaw bureau chief for the London Independant 
and the Economist magazine; and Stephen Weisman, now Tokyo bureau chief of the New York 
Times. In the mean time, you'll have a blast.
