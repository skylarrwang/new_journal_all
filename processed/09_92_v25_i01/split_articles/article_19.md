"They're called professional housewreckers," said 
Tanya, as she stood in front of the burnt-out 
shell of the apartment building at 71 County 
Street. "They think the landlord's rich, so they tear his 
apartment up. They punch holes in the wall, clog pipes 
with diapers and cigarette butts, bust the windows, and 
change the locks so that even he can't get in." Tanya moved 
to another building after tenants in one unit started a fire 
that gutted 71 County Street. "It's total disrespect," she 
added, shaking her head. 

New Haven's landlords face a crisis. Those who accept 
tenants on housing assistance and rent subsidies see growing 
numbers of people who neither maintain their apartments 
nor pay their rent. These landlords deal with a city adminis-
tration unsympathetic to their needs and an economic envi-
ronment that promises no return on their investment. Their 
dissatisfaction bodes ill for New Haven. Without the low-
income housing its landlords provide, the city will confront 
greater homelessness and a glut of empty buildings. 

New Haven has over 10,000 units of subsidized hous-
ing, one of the highest concentrations of low-income hous-
ing of any American city. Because of the shortage of public 
housing, the government offers subsidies to entice private 
landlords to house low-income tenants at reduced rents. 
"Landlords really work for the state," said Bruce Blair, direc-
tor of development for Christian Community Action, a 
New Haven group that provides emergency shelter and 
housing assistance for the homeless. "They handle clients 
on rent assistance whom the state cannot otherwise house, 
essentially managing properties for the state without super-
vision or support." 

A mix of full-paying and rent-subsidy tenants once 
allowed landlords to break even or turn a small profit. But, 
as the economy worsens, neighborhoods now contain more 
subsidized renters than ever before. As a result, landlords 
have lowered rents even further to accomodate the influx of 
welfare recipients. This in turn has driven away full-paying 
renters, and left many lessors dependent on subsidized rent. 

"You have all these landlords who thought they were 
going to make millions," said Frank Alvarado, director of 
New Haven's Office of Building Inspection and 
Enforcement, the branch of the city administration that 
ensures that buildings are up to code. "But when the real 
estate market fell through, they were stuck with all these 
properties they can neither sell nor maintain., 

The cost of owning property in New Haven has sky-
12 THE NI!W JouRNAL 
rocketed: in the past few years, property taxes have risen 
over 100 percent:' "Taxes have taken away all incentive to 
invest in New Haven," said Kevin Ski est, vice president of 
the Greater New Haven Property Owners Association. 

Because of the 1991 expansion of the sales tax, a landlord 
like James Rosenberry, head of Rosenberry Properties and 
one of the largest landlords in the city, must spend an extra 
$40,000 a year to cover the tax on services, like accounting, 
that he provides to his own partners. 

While taxes increase, New Haven property values have 
declined. The net worth of Rosenberry's 78 buildings, 
which contain over 420 apartments, plummeted from $20 
million to $6.8 million as the city's real estate market col-
lapsed. Rosenberry Properties lost an average of $50,000 to 
$60,000 a month in 1991. "I'm now fighting a rearguard," 
Rosenberry said. "Two years from now, I'll be bankrupt." 

'When the market fell through, 
landlords were left with all these 
properties they can neither sell nor 
maintain. " 

At the same time landlords struggle against a hostile 
economic environment, they must maintain disintegrating 
properties. Vandalism by violent or drug-addicted tenants 
has forced Rosenberry to double his spending for upkeep 
and repair in the past five years. "There are tenants out 
there whose lifestyle is destructive," Blair admitted. "How 
are you supposed to take care of buildings when the tenants 
themselves don't care?" 

When New Haven landlord Toni Criscollo visited 
one of her apartments to investigate reports of child 
beating by a tenant, she found rotting food on the 
kitchen counters. This summer Rosenberry evicted one 
tenant, Christina, who stopped paying her rent in order 
ro support her drug habit. Gunfights, broken windows, 
and violent domestic squabbles between Christina and 
her boyfriend made Rosenberry's other tenants nervous. 
Since her eviction, Christina has returned to emergency 
housing.
