**Title: Benno Schmidt's Troubled Tenure**
**Author: Erik Meers**
**Page number(s): 20-21**

Many professors, students, and alums could scarcely 
contain their glee at the news that Benno 
Schmidt, Yale's 20th president, planned to resign. 
His abrupt decision last May came after a year of unprecedented 
turmoil and dissatisfaction with his leadership. 
Although Schmidt accepted Yale's presidency as a rising 
national star and has since enjoyed significant successes, he 
leaves the university with his stature diminished. Schmidt's 
early accomplishments in life provided him with a sterling 
resume but did not train him in the nuances of consensus-
building required to lead a university. 


A history of Schmidt's early years reads like a caricature 
of Old Blue privilege. His father, Benno Sr., earned a for-
tune as a founding partner in America's first venture capital 
firm, the J.H. Whitney Company. As a child, Benno Jr. 
attended an exclusive boy's grammar school in Manhattan 
and went on to Phillips Exeter Academy. Schmidt entered 
Yale as an undergraduate in 1959. In 
those days Schmidt was, by his own 
admission, more interested in 
hockey than history, his undergraduate 
major. 


Yet Schmidt blossomed academically at Yale Law 
School, and quickly rose to the top of his class. When he 
graduated in 1966 he won a law student's fantasy job-a 
clerkship with Earl Warren, then Chief Justice of the 
Supreme Court. After his stint in Warren's office, Schmidt 
joined the faculty of Columbia Law School, where he 
became a full professor in just four years. 


In the intellectual community, Schmidt's reputation 
flourished with the publication of his book Freedom of the 
Press vs. Public Access, still considered one of the most 
important works on the rights of the media. He gained 
national prominence as moderator of the PBS series The 
Constitution: That Delicate Balance. After law school 
and faculty alike mourned the loss of their native son: 
Giamatti had attended Yale graduate school and served as a 
professor of Renaissance literature before becoming 
President in 1979. His experience as student and teacher 
gave him an understanding of both constituencies. 


When the search committee charged with replacing 
Giamatti began to screen applicants, Schmidt, with his 
resume, rose to the top of the list. He 
faculty selected Schmidt as dean in 1984, he 
worked tirelessly at fundraising, collecting 
a school record $9 million in just two years. 


The meteoric rise of a Yale alumnus did not escape the 
notice of the Yale Corporation. When A. Bartlett 
Giamatti announced his resignation as University 
President in 1986, Corporation members had Schmidt's 
name on the tip of their collective tongue. Still, filling 
Giamatti's shoes promised to be a difficult task. Students 


Although he had aggressively pursued the job, Schmidt


To further complicate matters, Schmidt's third wife, 
Helen Whitney, felt even more reluctant than her husband 
to leave New York, where she had a career as a documentary 
filmmaker. To help persuade Schmidt, the Corporation 
agreed that he could spend a substantial amount of time 
with his wife in New York. With this assurance in hand, 
Schmidt accepted the job, to the relief of the Corporation 
and the praise of the media. Time magazine hailed 
Schmidt's selection with the headline "Blue-Chip Choice." 


In his September 1986 inaugural address, Schmidt 
ardently championed the need to protect freedom of 
expression. As he delivered his speech, 500 students outside 
Woolsey Hall took the new President at his word and 
boisterously protested Yale's policy of partial investment in 
South Africa. 


In his '86 address, Schmidt foreshadowed 
the media backlash against "political correctness" by several 
years. He argued 
against the adoption of university 
statutes banning hate speech-words 
like "nigger" and "fag." "People are saying that victimized 
groups require protection against such statements," 
Schmidt said. "[This creates] a new egalitarian threat 
against freedom of expression." 


Free speech issues would 
dog Schmidt throughout his six-
year tenure. Students constructed 
mock shanties outside the President's 
office at Woodbridge Hall to protest Yale's invest-
ments in South Africa. In the face of strong alumni disap-
proval, Schmidt maintained the right of students to protest. 
When an angry alumnus torched the shanties, Schmidt 
condemned the action and allowed students to build a new 
monument. 


Schmidt drew a distinction between free speech and 
obstruction, however, when he ordered the arrest of 21 anti-
apartheid protestors occupying Yale's investment office. 
Schmidt declared at the time: "No university can tolerate 
the disruption of its functions." His patience eventually 
paid off: students' interest in South Africa waned, and the 
monument ceased to be an issue. A group of students quietly 
disassembled the structure in 1991. 


Schmidt's reputation for balance and sensitivity on 
complex issues of free speech contrasted markedly with the 
high-handedness he showed during a crisis at the School of
