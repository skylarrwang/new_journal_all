Landlords also express frustration about coUecting rent 
tenants to live in my places in the city, I can't compete with 
checks from their subsidized tenants. "Getting that $50 to 
brand-new condos in the suburbs," she said. To make mat-
$70 out of them each month is like pulling teeth," said 
ters worse, there are no more new Section Eight certificates 
Criscollo. "If you don't hustle over there by the third or the 
available in New Haven. Because of budget constraints, the 
fourth of the month, the money's gone. The real good ten-
current waiting list for the program is so long that prospec-
ants will call and tell me, 'Come and get it ,.---..;;.__ ________ __ 
before I spend it."' 

But most welfare recipients lack the 
money to cover food and living expenses, 
much less rent. "They get $314 a month," 
said Meir Lakein (JE '91), a community 
organizer who works for the Homeless 
Persons Organization Project. "Rent is 
$325. Where are they going to get the extra 
$11 ?" As for the charges of tenant neglect, 
Lakein countered that landlords often 
ignore basic building maintenance and 
show up only to collect rent. 

recent policy changes by the city and 
state regarding rent assistance have 
both landlords and community 
advocates worried about the future of subsi-
dized housing. A change in a legal require-
ment involving federal assistance has trig-
gered a flight of reliable low-income tenants 
out of New Haven. Under Section Eight 
federal housing subsidy regulations, tenants 
on rent assistance set aside one-third of their 
income for rent and utilitites. The govern-
ment then makes up the difference between 
the tenant's contribution and the "fair rent 
value." Before last year, the city's Section 
Eight recipients had to use their certificates 
in New Haven. In 1991 , however, the 
Department of Housing anc Urban 
Development began to permit tenants to 
use federal assistance anywhere in the state.

for the suburbs, where they could continue 
paying their third and live in a safer, more peaceful environ-
ment. Because of the overconstruction of the '80s, a large 
number of suburban landlords saddled with unoccupied 
condominiums and apartments lowered their rents to cut 
their losses. Criscollo has found it more difficult now to 
attract responsible tenants. "When I'm advertising for new

rive tenants must wait at least two years before the govern-
ment considers their application. 

A recent change in city welfare policy has further jeop-
ardized the stability of the housing situation in New Haven. 
Last June, the city welfare department stopped ~nding rent 
assistance checks directly to the landlords, leaving the 
responsibility of rent payments to the 
tenants. "We're out of the rent business 
entirely," declared Raymond Lopes, 
director of the Welfare Department. 
He cited the overload of paperwork as a 
main reason for the change in policy. 
Since the new welfare policy wem 
into effect, only six of Rosenberry's 42 
tenants who receive assistance from the 
city have paid their rent. "We're going 
to end up evicting the rest," Rosenberry 
said. Lopes himself admits that evic-
tions in New Haven have increased due 
to the new policy, but he also says that 
the new regulations affect only one-
fourth of the subsidized tenants in New 
Haven. 

A bleak future for New 
Haven housing: 
abandoned buildings 
and vagrancy. 
Landlords fault the city for its fail-
ure co adequately monitor tenants. 
When Criscollo called the Department 
of C hild and Youth Services to report 
her tenant for child abuse, the city did 
not act. "They don't even want to go to 
the apartment and see for themselves," 
she said. "One of these days those kids 
are going to turn up dead." 

Landlords complain that media 
coverage of exploitative landlords, like 
New Haven's Ali Antar, contributes to 
a general stereotype of urban landlords 
as slumlords. Listed under seven differ-
ent aliases, nearly half of Antar's 18 
properties failed to adhere to the hous-
ing code in 1990. While landlords con-
cede that slumlords exist, they argue 
that the majority of landlords in the 
city are honest. Instead, they emphasize 
their tenants' own destructiveness. 
"Antar may be bad news, but he's not 
the one who kicks out his windows or 
dumps his garbage in the backyard," 
said Rosenberry. 



Lakein, however, maintains that 
landlords unfairly blame their tenant's 
lifesryles for the state of their proper-
ties. H e suggested that landlords may 
harbor racist hostiliry towards the low-
income tenants they house. "When 
these landlords talk about poor people 
tearing things up, sometimes the sub-
text there i~ that they mean 'black peo-
ple,"' said Lakein. 

Although training programs might 
help low-income tenants take better 
care of their homes, the steadily 
increasing numbers on rent subsidies 
make such programs nearly impossible 
to administer. Blair and Rosenberry 
envision a bleak future for New Haven 
housing: abandoned buildings and 
vagrancy like the crisis in Detroit. 
Lakein, on the other hand, worries that 
the ciry will accede too readily to land-
lord demands. "We could do what the 
landlords want, which is to make sure 
that they get their rent money," he 
said. "In that case, we'd still have the 
landlords, but their properties and 
their tenants could go to hell for all 
they care." 

Lakein proposes a more tenant-
friendly approach. H e hopes to see the 
city become much stricter in enforcing 
laws that protect tenants from landlord 
mismanagement. And instead of a ten-
ant training program, he suggests a 
course in money management for 
recipients of housing assistance. "If you 
haven't had a lot of money in your life, 
of course you're not going to know 
how to spend it or co save it," he said. 

For now, landlords continue trying 
to make ends meet and hope they do 
not fall victim to foreclosure. "We just 
don't pay the banks," Rosenberry 
explained. "We pay the bills, and if a 
dollar is left, we send it to the banks," 
Roseberry said. "If $1 ,000 is left, we 
send it to the banks. The banks are not 
happy, but they haven't gotten to 
us yet."
