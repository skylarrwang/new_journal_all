en Jonathan Einhorn challenged John Daniels 
n last year's mayoral race, he seemed to spend 
more time attadcing Yale's tax-free status than his 
opponent's shortcomings. While Einhorn lost the election, 
he followed a time-honored tradition of bashing Yale to 
gain voter support. Such rhetoric has always struck a nerve 
among New Haven voters. Still, considering that pitched 
battles and bloodshed once characterized town-gown dis-
putes, today's relationship between Yale and New Haven is 
a bed of roses. 

Unlike today's politicians, influential New Haven resi-
dents originally believed that a college would improve the 
economy, reputation, and culrurallife of their city. Many of 
16 THE NEW jOURNAL 
them strenuously lobbied the Colonial government to 
move the Collegiate School-which later became Yale--
from Saybrook to the Elm City in 1715. But the town-
gown honeymoon ended only two decades after the first 
wagonload of books arrived in New Haven. Angered by 
tax privileges that Connecticut's charter granted the 
College, citizen pamphleteers of the 17 40s accused school 
administrators of everything from mismanaging funds to 
instructing students in blasphemy. To make marrers worse, 
Yalies so often failed to pay their creditors at local business-
es that the college president and council rightly regulated 
students' private spending. 

Colonial-era quarrels between Yale men and "townies"

remained mere wars of words, and at times the two groups 
even cooperated. In 1779, students fought side by side with 
the people of New Haven in an unsuccessful attempt co 
save the city from an advancing British army. Yet divisions 
existed even in the heat of battle: Colonel Edmund 
Fanning (Yale 1757), commander of the invading King's 
American Regiment of Foot, spared his alma mater while 
directing his men to burn many of the surrounding build-
ings. Years later, townsmen grumbled when the grateful 
college a~arded the Canadian officer an honorary degree. 

Y
ale College grew in physical size after the Revolution, 
eventually pushing the town poorhouse, jail, and 
several taverns off the present-day Old Campus. As 
Anglicanism waned in America, New Haven citizens 
accused conservative Yale of religious bigotry and intoler-
ance. The college and the cown seemed doomed to remain 
spiritually irreconciled, and city planners even laid out the 
new Grove Street Cemetery with separate plots for "Yale 
students, People of Color, and Strangers." In addition, the 
involvement ofYalies in local politics provoked a great deal 
of anger. New Haven's newspapers waged a continual cam-
paign to either abolish the College's tax-exempt status or co 
ban students from holding office altogether. 

Eventually the milder quarrels of the Colonial era 
exploded into a pitched battle. "We have had Considerable 
Bustle here two Saturday Evenings past between the 
Students in College and the Town Boys," wrote New 
Haven businessman Erastus Osborn in May 1812. "Last 
Sunday Evening the number on each side was said co be 
nearly 400. They attacked with Clubs, Knives, etc. The 
Sheriff and his Deputies and the Constables interfered, 
Commanded the Peace, etc., but to no effect." Unlike later 
riots, the fuse violent town-gown confrontation resulted in 
only a few injuries and the arrest of some Yalies. 

Tension between students and "townies" grew after the 
1812 incident. The port's sailors and idle young men took 
pride in their ability to taunt Yalies, whose wealth and 
snobbishness irritated them. In turn, the students enjoyed 
annoying townsfolk with their tiresome pranks, and at 
times the srolen signs and gates of neighboring houses lay 
in chick piles around the College yard. And since Yalies and 
local boys often vied for the attentions of the same young 
women, town socials turned into potentially explosive 
affairs. 

The uneasy limbo of a dozen years finally gave way to 
violence after several Yale medical students stole a corpse 
from a West Haven graveyard. The body-snatching inci-
dent initiated a four-decade period of sporadic fighting 
between townspeople and students. By the lace 1820s, 
pitched battles had become a semi-institutionalized part of 
Yale. "Many years ago, there was a feud between students 
and townsmen: a sort of general ill-feeling which manifest-
ed itself in the lower classes of society in rudeness and 
insult," observed the snobbish hisrorian Ezekiel Porter

Belden. "An organization in opposition followed, and a 
band of tipsy townsmen took the field, [were] repulsed , and 
a huge knotty club wrested from their leader." Until the 
faculty abolished the custom in the 1840s, Yale seniors 
proudly passed this "Bully Club" co an all-around leader in 
each class. 

As the century progressed, Yale students destroyed the 
town's fire engine, killed a young New Haven man, and kept 
the perpetratOrs' identities secret-all in the n:l.{Tle of Bully 
loyalty. In 1845, the New Haven Common Council autho-
rized the appointment of special watchmen to quell riots 
and suppress the problems arising from citizen-student 
strife. 

By mid-century, tempers had worn so thin chat at 
times Yalies only ventured outside of the College in large 
groups. Wary of potential problems, the administration 


refused to allow students to attend 
community functions. Ignoring the 
ban, about 70 Yalies attended a show 
at Homan's Theater one evening in 
1851. Word spread quicldy through 
downtown, and an angry mob num-
bering in the thousands confronted 
the students as they left Homan's. 
Sensing imminent danger, the police-
escorted Yalies quickly fled to the 
safety of the college's high walls. 
From his office, Police Captain 
Lyman Bissell recognized a sound he 
had not heard since the Mexican 
War: the rattle of a cannon being 
positioned for anack. "The rioters 
loaded the piece to the muzzle with 
cannon balls, grape-shot, stones, 
pieces of brick, etc., and drew it up 
before South College," recalled wit-
ness H enry Howe. "All was made 
ready, the gun duly pointed, and the 
match lighted." Fortunately for Yale, 
the quick-witted Bissell joined the 
crowd in time to sabotage its gun. 
The mob of disappointed townspeo-
ple dispersed after vowing to get even 
another day. 

en a similar altercation 
between students and fire-
men (without artillery) 
resulted in the death of a town volun-
teer in 1858, the angry townspeople 
almost rioted. But by 1863, the seri-
ous town-gown incidents which had 
plagued the Elm City since the 1820s 
came to an end. Years of civil wac had 
finally dulled the fighting spirit of the 
young men on both sides. 

Post-wac battle weariness and the 
advent of tension-releasing college 
athletics produced a sort of d~tente in 
town-gown relations. As the College 
grew into a university, Yale and New 
Haven leaders tried to repair their 
fractious relationship. In 1880 Yale 
donated 20 acres of land to enlarge the 
city's new East Rock Park, while New 
Haven's mayor appointed an official 
committee to participate in the 
University's 1901 bicentennial celebra-
tion. 

But many community members 
still felt that the University held itself 
aloof from the problems of the city. 
George Dudley Seymour, presidenc 
of Yale during the first decade of the 
20th century, attempted to sway citi-
zens with "Cicy Beautiful" and "Save 
the Elms" campaigns. He even con-
vinced College trustees to open the 
once-exclusive Peabody Museum,and 
Trumbull Art Gallery to the public 
on Sunday afternoons. 

T
own-gown relations peaked 
during World War I, as both 
communities pulled together 
to ensure victory. "On the home 
front the war effort was distinguished 
by a remarkable cooperation between 
the cicy and the University," wrote his-
torian Rollin Osterweis. "The 1 02nd 
Regiment was organized and rrained 
at the Yale Bowl; the great dining hall 
became the workroom of the New 
Haven chapter of the American Red 
Cross; Woolsey Hall was the scene of a 
succession of meetings and concerts 
designed to keep the general morale at 
a high pitch. For its part, the city 
invited the Yale military units to use 
the Green for drilling and the docks 
for naval training." 

But to New Haven residents, the 
opening of a few facilities during 
wartime did not change the fact that 
Yale still symbolized elitism, wealth, 
and privilege. During a May 1919 vic-
