As New Haven anticipated the 
arrival of professional tennis stars for 
the Volvo International Tournament, 
local youngsters geared up for an event 
of their own. In early July, dozens of 
New Haven kids gathered at the Yale 
Bowl itching to hit the courts and 
compete against other budding young 
players from New York, Connecticut, 
and New Jersey. The tournament, like 
the community clinic program that 
gave rhe kids playing time and instruc-
tion throughout the year, earned rave 
reviews from its young participants. 

"This is only my second tournament," 
said Jason Diosa, who plays at a clinic 
at the Edgewood courts every summer 
morning. "I like the sport, and the 
coaches make it fun to go and learn 
strokes." 

In 1990, Jewel Productions, which 
owns and operates the Volvo-spon-
sored pro tournament, moved the 
event from Vermont to New Haven. 
To open the traditionally upper crust 
sport of tennis to youth in urban 
neighborhoods, they created the grass-
rootS tennis clinic program. "We want 
to see the city kids become as comfort-
able on the tennis court as they have 
been in the sandlot in years past," said 
Jean McAndrews, the program direc-
tor. "We see tennis as a positive pres-
ence in the neighborhood that can give 
these kids something to be proud of." 

Jewel Productions coordinates the 
program with the city of New Haven, 
the 
New 
Haven 
Recreational 
Department, the public school system, 
and the United States Tennis 
Association. To develop and refine the 
program so that it best meers the com-
munity's needs, McAndrews works 
year-round with city and public school 
officials, New Haven recreation direc-
tors, and an advisory board put togeth-
er by Mayor John Daniels. 

During the school year, the pro-
gram focuses on local middle schools, 
training gym instructors to teach tennis 
6 TH£ N£w jouRNAL 
alongside more traditional gym class 
sports like basketball and baseball. In 
addition, Volvo runs after-school clin-
ics at eight locations in New Haven. 
Winter after-school clinics take place 
once or twice a week in school gyms, 
where instructors lower volleyball nets 
and substitute Nerf balls for the tradi-
tional hard rubber variety. Summer 
weather allows the clinics to move out-
doors to park courtS and school yards. 

The program has grown steadily 
over the past three years. In 1990, 
summer clinics provided daily free 
at the Yale Bowl's Center Court. 
instruction to more than 400 New 
H aven kids of all ages, offering a total 
of 850 free coaching hours. Last year 
the program expanded to Bridgeport. 
It now reaches a total of 900 kids with 
1,260 free hours of coaching. In addi-
tion, more than 250 students partici-
pate each week in the year-round mid-
dle-school program. This summer the 
program began sponsoring the 
Governor's Cup, a full day of Davis 
Cup-style team competition in mid-
August. Two boys and girls from each 
of seven area cities compete, and final-
ists receive formal recognition by 
Connecticut governor Lowell Weicker 
which draws top-notch professional 
competitors from around the world. 

Kids from the grassroots program get 
free admission to some of the tourna-
ment's matches. Their game benefits 
from more than just observation; some 
of the pros find rime between matches 
to hold clinics. In recent years, stars 
like Arthur Ashe, Stefan Edberg, Ivan 
Lend!, and MaliVai Washington have 
donated their t_ime. Some pros also 
conduct clinics during the year and 
speak about how tennis can make kids 
winners not only as athletes, but also as 
srudenrs and members of the commu-
nity. 

Kids learn th~ basics at a fr~~ clinic run by Nro~ Havm s grassroots tmnis program.
