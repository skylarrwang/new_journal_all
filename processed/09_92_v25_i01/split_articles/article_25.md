When Howard Lamar, a history professor and former dean of Yale College, appeared at a press conference to announce his appointment as interim president of Yale University, hundreds of people gave him a standing ovation. And another, and another, and another. "He wasn't prepared for the powerful reception he received," said history professor Cynthia Russett, who attended the June 17 announcement. "He was really overwhelmed." 

To date, Lamar's appointment has generated almost universal jubilation on campus. After a year of budget battles, stormy resignations, and growing bitterness among faculty and students (see related story page 20), many have heralded the history professor's appointment as the first step toward restoring Yale's tarnished reputation. "The mood on campus changed overnight," said Associate Provost Lloyd Suttle, whom Lamar tapped to serve as Advisor to the President. 

Suttle and others caution against expecting miracles from Lamar's administration, which will last for about a year while the Yale Corporation chooses Benno Schmidt's permanent successor. Still, Lamar himself hopes that substantive and positive change will occur during his year at the helm. "My own goal will be to turn over my office to a successor with the condition that things are almost back to normal," he said. 

The Corporation's selection committee chose Lamar for the presidency after a short but intensive search process that began immediately after Schmidt resigned on May 26. The committee contacted over 150 people, in addition to numerous students and faculty, and considered about a dozen candidates for the job. From the beginning Lamar was high on everyone's list. As a popular professor and a former dean, he could boast both administrative experience and warm relations with faculty, students and alumni. "Not a single person had a negative comment about him," said Senator David L. Boren (CC '63), a Democrat from Oklahoma and a Corporation member who served on the search committee. At a private two-day retreat, the Corporation voted unanimously to offer him the post. 

At first, however, Lamar turned them down. Having just retired from a 40-year teaching career, he had several research projects in the works, and wanted to travel. "Between his other commitments and the suddenness of it all, he was not at a stage in his career where he was looking for another administrative challenge," Suttle said. 

But the Corporation would not take no for an answer, and others urged Lamar to reconsider. "I felt tremendous pressure, not just from the Corporation committee, but from my colleagues in the history department and across the university," Lamar recalled. "I finally accepted the job because I love this place. It's given me a chance to do work that I love in a field that I love, and it's been supportive of my research and teaching and of the well-being of my family. I was very happy to perform this last act of service." 

The Corporation was also happy-so happy that when Lamar called to accept the job, they serenaded him with a rendition of "Bright College Years." "It was not concert quality, but it was heartfelt," said Boren. "Lamar's selection sent a strong message of respect for the faculty and communicated how strongly we wanted Yale to be one family." 

"My own goal will be to turn over my office to a successor with the condition that things are almost back to normal."

Since Lamar took office on July 1, he has striven to set himself apart from Benno Schmidt in almost every way-although he is careful not to criticize his predecessor. "Schmidt didn't articulate an educational vision, but he articulated a wish for Yale to continue to be a first-rate university," Lamar said. "He was very hard at work at his fiscal vision, and it's an important one." 

Lamar's vision for Yale includes financial solvency; he will continue the $1.5 billion fundraising campaign that Schmidt launched. But he will refrain from the frequent fundraising junkets that marked Schmidt's administration. "I will go on the road periodically, but not as much as Schmidt did," Lamar said. "I couldn't be visible around here and also travel a lot." 

"Visible" and "accessible" have become the new catchwords at Woodbridge Hall. Unlike Schmidt, who split his time between New York and New Haven, Lamar actually lives in the Elm City. He plans to open up the administration's decision-making process by welcoming input from all
