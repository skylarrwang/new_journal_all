The program tries co recruit 
coaches from New Haven, and often 
taps local high school and college stu-
dents. Instructor Tilden Lyons, who 
has worked at the program since its 
inception, sees his job as more chan 
teaching topspin. "It's more chan just 
exercise for these kids. You really gee 
to help them mature both on and off 
the court." 

Because the program spans the 
summer, coaches and students have 
time to get to know each other. 
"These kids are so much fun to teach," 
said coach Brett Demambro. "By the 
end of the summer they seem like fam-
ily, not just kids you help with a few 
strokes. We take them out to lunch 
after the clinic sometimes, or just sic 
and talk." The mentor aspect of the 
program motivates Demambro to 
teach during hot and humid New 
H aven summers. "I probably won't 
turn anyone into a tennis superstar, 
but I definitely let the children know 
that there are people here for them, 
that they're not alone," she said. 

Twelve-year old Lopez Williams 
enjoys the program for simpler rea-
sons. "It's free!" he said, and then 
added, "No, really, I just like being 
able to play."
