On their first day in England, a 
group of Yale-in-London students 
went house-hunting. At one of the 
homes, th~ u.vner, an elderly art histo-
ry professor, not only walked them 
through his house, but also took the 
rest of the day to show them the sights 
of the city. As he shepherded them

from John Keats' house to Hampstead 
Heath and Parliament Hill, the profes-
sor waxed eloquent about local lore 
and treated them to a typical pub 
lunch. "At first we were suspicious of 
his intentions, then astonished," said 
Janice Pomerance (CC '93). "We final-
ly chalked it up to a lavish display of 
English hospitality."

here virtually breathe British culture." 

Part of the curriculum involves visits 
to museums, London theaters, and a 
three-day excursion to the English 
countryside. 

Participants appreciate the oppor-
tunity to enhance their understanding 
of Britain through the experience of 
living in London. "The theater trips

Industrialist Paul Mellon set up an 
endowment in 1981 to allow American 
students to experience British art and 
culture first-hand through the Paul 
Mellon Centre for Studies in British 
Art. The research-oriented Centre pro-
vides program participants with an 
excellent library on British art and a 
photographic archive of 75,000 prints 
and 20,000 negatives of British paint-
ing, sculpture, and drawing. 

What students cannot find within 
the centre exists just beyond its walls. 
London, with its museums, galleries, 
theaters, universities, and libraries, is a 
vast resource in itself. "Our central 
location in London has always been 
very important," said centre director 
Michael Kitson. "The British Museum 
and Reading Room are just down the 
road, the theater district within walk-
were fantastic," said Yoji Nimura (CC 
'93), who attended the program last 
spring. "And getting the chance to 
study in a large international city like 
London was an essential part of the 
program." 

Yale-in-London consists of four 
courses each semester on subjects 
ranging from art and art history to 
architecture, drama, and literature. 
Since fewer than 15 students enroll in 
the program, they get the chance to 
work closely with professors. "We have 
the opportunity to get to know the 
students personally," said deputy 
director Brian Allen. Nirnura appreci-
ated the individual attention profes-
sors gave their students. "Having 
three professors teaching nine students 
in four seminars is something you'd 
never get at Yale," he said. "We would

even go out together to the theater 
and to pubs." 

Despite its attractions and initial 
popularity, Yale-in-London has suf-
fered from a lack of student interest in 
recent years. The Gulf War and the 
recession have made students less 
enthusiastic about spending a semester 
or year in England. "I suspect that par-
ems are thinking twice about sending 
their children overseas because of the 
expense," Kitson said. 

In addition, most undergraduates 
know very little about Yale-in-
London. Although the Paul Mellon 
Centre and the Yale Center for British 
Art (BAC) publicize the program 
through 
information 
sessions, 
brochures, and posters, most students 
who decide to attend hear of it 
through friends. "Students get so 
much mail that they probably throw 
away our brochure almost immediate-
ly," lamented Allen. "Our best recruit-
ment has tended to be word-of-
mouth, especially through our stu-
dents and professors." 

Kitson believes that the elimina-
tion of the British Studies program in 
1986 cut off the most obvious channel 
for recruitment. And Yale's continued 
lack of encouragement for study 
abroad has dealt the London program 
a further blow. In Kitson's opinion, 
Yale departments should actively sup-
port the College's only overseas pro-
gram by recommending it to students 
interested in British art, history, 
drama, or literature. 

Although the Paul Mellon Centre 
does not depend financially on Yale-
in-London, Kitson and Allen fed con-
cern for the program's future. "The 
problem is recruiting enough students 
to make the whole program economi-
cally viable," said Allen. "The other 
things we do on Yale's behalf-like 
promoting the study of British art as 
the sister institute to the BAG-are all 
very well. But we would like to contin-
ue this connection with Yale under-
graduates."
