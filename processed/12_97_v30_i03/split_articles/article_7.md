We have to give it to Money magazine. 

They know a money-maker when they 
see one. U.S. Nws & World Report (a distant 
third to Time and Newseek) figured out that a 
second-tier magazine can survive entirely 
off the overwhelming 
public appetite for 
ridiculously neat and 
pat answers to ex-
tremely 
complex 
questions. Thus college 
rankings were born. Now 
Money (a distant third to 
Fortune and Forbes) has figured 
oui: that each year there are more 
people contemplating moves to 
other cities than high school seniors 
thinking about college. Thus city rankings are 
born. 

It's not clear how we at Yale are supposed 
to react to Monejs conclusion that New 
Haven is America's "third most dangerous 
small city." More likely than not, however, Yale 
will shrug its collective shoulders, remain in 
New Haven, and continue to be what U.S 
News and World &port considers America's 
third best university. Everybody from Presi-
dent Levin down to the freshest of pre-frosh 
seems to agree that Yale is safe, and if anyone 
has any lingering doubts, a quick walk down 
Elm Street is a lot more convincing than a 
chart in America's third best financial maga-
zine. 

But some people do read Money, primarily 
when they find a copy in a dentist office, and 
once they do they'll probably believe that New 
Haven is akin to Lebanon circa the mid-
1980s. This kind of characterization is not one 
that generally holds sway with the people who 
actually live in Yale's pared of the the Elm 
City. Roger Vann, president of the local 
NAACP, once said in these pages, "The whole 
thing about New Haven being a war zone is 
overblown. It's a city, folks. Get over it." The 
local reality is once again much less exciting 
than the national myth. 

Anyone who has ever shopped the first lec-
ture of Statistics 123a can tell you why num-
bers don't always tell the truth. In the case of 
Monejs list, the numbers make a lot less sense 
when you read the fine print. To weigh differ-
ent kinds of crime in its tabulations, Money 
relies on the results of a national poll that asks 
people which crimes they fear the most. Since 
more people are robbed than mur-
dered, it is no surprise that 
people will tell you they 
fear 
their house 
being 
robbed more than they 
being murdered. 

And so, in Monejs 
rankings, burglaries 
make a city more 
dangerous. 

Now, 
of coUrse, if the poll 
asked which crime peo-
ple would rather not have happen 
to them, the results would certainly be a whole 
lot different. 

Last year, Money did not break cities down 
by size, and New Haven was rated the 21st 
most dangerous city in America mosdy 
because we were 9th in car theft and 14th in 
burglary. As crimes become more violent, 
though, New Haven's ranking slips: 29th in 
assaults, 38th in rapes, 54th in murders. 

We at The New journal accept the fact that 
this Money's information is useful to some-
soccer moms looking out for minivan-theft 
rings, corporate executives fearful for their 
$10,000 hi-fi stereo-but since when has New 
Haven considered itself the next Greenwich or 
Darien? New Haven is a city with seven uni-
versities and packed with college students, not 
a suburban sprawl. New Haven has it's prob-
lems, certainly, but we don't have mass mur-
derers or serial rapists, and-at least on this 
side of Fortress Yale-we don't even stay up 
nights fearing break-ins. Money's list only feeds 
our parent's mistaken fears that they've sent 
their children into the belly of an urban beast 
while chipping away at the morale of a city 
that is making considerable progres in cutting 
crime through a~irable programs like com-
munity policing as well as developing a reputa-
tion as Connecticut's cultural center.
