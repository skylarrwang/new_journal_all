I was stroking Lord Tennyson's 
hair the other day. He-well, at least 
some of what's left of him-is kept in 
Beinecke in an unassuming gray box. And 
all I needed to do to borrow Tennyson from 
the library was some paper work and a 
promise to only use a pencil. In fact, I could 
have been petting the likes of Napoleon 
Bonaparte, Charles Dickens, Robert Louis 
Stevenson, Benjamin Silliman, or Lord 
Byron. Beinecke has quite a cast of charac~ 
ters in its catalog under the keyword hair, 24 
locks in all. 

The Tennyson box I received was divid-
ed into ten 61es: doodles and halves of notes 
in one 61e, a segment of Lady Tennyson's 
wedding dress, and an envelope written on 
by a relative. When I turned the envelope 
over, Tennyson's hair was creepin~ out of it. 
He was peeking out, as if caught in a last 
attempt to escape 20th century curiosity. 
Unexpectedly, my stomach was moved more 
by the sight of his hair than my heart was 
ever moved by his words. I never thought 
that I would have been so repulsed by having

Lord Tennyson in my hands, nor do I think 
he ever expected to be there. 

"It makes you feel like you are in the 
same world as, say, Robert Louis Stevenson. 
It is a way to make people intrigued and 
involved in the past," Joseph Reed says of the 
famous locks of hair. Reed, an English pro-
fessor at Wesleyan, put together an exhibit of 
the random things in the Beinecke collection 
three years ago. But all I could imagine was 
Tennyson in my lap. He was more frail than 
I had thought. In the Beinecke reading 
room, it was either Tennyson's hair or I who 
seemed out of place. The hair conjured up 
the past, but the thoughts it created for me 
were entwined with images of death. A body 
dead for 130 years. It used to be part of a liv-
ing organism, but once cut, it lays limp and 
dead. Like a severed limb-what do you do 
with it? Keep it? 

Auntie Tennyson kept the Lord's hair in Â· 
order to remember. The next file had locks 
of both the Lord and the Lady's hair from 
their wedding day. The problem is that there 
was a third clump of gray hair. Whose hair 
was that? And how did it get into the same 
time capsule as the lovers' locks? 

My stomach turned again. 

"It all started with the Victorians. They 
kept a piece of Martin Luther's garment and 
then everyone's hair," Reed explains. It was a 
keepsake. People wore hair as mourning jew-
elry: a ring with the hair of a deceased loved 
one. Some wore it wrapped around their 
wrists-as John Donne described, "A bracelet 
of bright hair bound around the bone." They 
were buried with the hair of the loved one, 
and when their own flesh melted, it would 
remain around the bone. The hair survived as 
a memory and then outlived the memory. 

In the 1850s, a Philadelphia scientist 
named Peter A. Browne collected hair, and 
called it a pile, because he felt he could clas-
sifY people according to 
hair. Browne was one of 
the first to use hair in a 
scientific study and be-
lieved that he had found a 
difference between hair 
grown from an insane 
mind and a sane one. 

Indeed, 
afrer 
touching 
Lord Tennyson's hair, I would certainly clas-
sify Tennyson as a good fellow, trustworthy, 
though somewhat timid.

Recent science has used the DNA found 
in hair to relate the Romanovs to Britain's 
Prince Phillip. Perhaps Yale has kept the 
clumps of distinguished hair in hopes that 
they would endow the university with all 
those genes. Napoleon's hair is, of course, a 
vestige of the Napoleonic complex, which 
Yale was quick to capitalize on. 

A Beinecke curator maintains, "We don't 
go looking for hair-
it may be left to us, but 
we don't have an interest in buying a lock of 
hair." But it seems that some people do go ~~ 
looking. Beinecke houses a lock of Major 
Andre's hair taken from his exhumed body 
and donated to the library. 

Though they didn't loot graves for their 
hair, the curators of Beinecke might find that 
others covet their resource. They could make 
some money selling the strands as "trinkets 
of famous literary figures" at the grand open-
ing of the Yale Bookstore. Or create a new 
promotion: buy a book, get the author's hair. 
It might sell. Who knows what kind of sci-
entific or capitalistic scheme collected locks 
of hair will fall victim to in the future? 

I wanted to cut my hair, but now I think 
I might keep it all to myself, all on my head. 
But perhaps I am being paranoid-after all, 
who would ever want my hair?
