Outdated perhaps, outnumbered for sure, but hardly out of power, 
Yale's campus conservatives still command big bucks. 
T
HE GAME IS POR TENNIS. A PAST-PACED, INTENSE CONTESf OF 
wit. The rules are simple. They play on teams, two on two, 
three on three-almost like regular tennis, except they play 
with words instead of balls. One team serves up a word, and 
the other bounces one back that is somehow connected to the first. The 
goal, like regular tennis, is to make the opponents run, sweat, fall on 
their faces. 

Tonight's match starts slowly, but as sobriety among the Party of the 
Right wears off, the pace picks up, even attracting a few observers. A new 
match is beginning. A pensive pause sets in before the firSt serve. 
Social, he begins, eyeing the opposition. 
Breakdown, the opposition returns. 
He rallies: Rap. And the words shoot back and forth: 
Porn. 
. Playboy. 
Western. 
Decline. 

The table shakes with pounding of approval from the sidelines. Tech-
nically, the game isn't over-the points are not yet tallied-but the audi-
ence has passed its judgment. They have chosen their winner. 

Stripped of its rules and form, POR Tennis is essentially a test of 
legitimacy. Everyone has to earn his place on the court of conservative 
intellectualism. In this sport, esoteric historical references and subversive-
ness will earn you respect, and liberalism will get you lynched. 

But scoring points on the intellectual plane isn't enough to merit 
membership in the POR. By entering the POR, students enter not only 
an intellectual world, but also an entire culture of conservatism. Atten-
dance is virtually mandatory for weeknight dinners at Saybrook, late-
night debates, Friday toastings at Mory's, and weekend social events like 
cards and games night. Gaining membership is a long and involved 
process, often taking months for someone to be finally voted in. In a 
iii symbolic gesture, nonmembers of the POR cannot be recognized by 
~ their full names in the sign-in books at party events. If a nonmember 
~ uses their full name, it will be crossed out later. Once petitioners become 
t members, they can use their own middle name or choose another. As 
! testament to the fierce exclusivity of the POR, one of the most effective 
.c 
t::: ways to insult a POR member is to call him a "social normalise," a per-
"' 
~ son whose friends are mostly non-POR members. Implicit in member-
f: ship in the mainstream is a betrayal of conservative loyalties and selling 
~ out to campus liberalism. 

}; 
Although the Conservative Party splintered off from the POR and 
~ insists there are differences between the two groups, its members are sim-
~ ilarly consumed by party events. The Conservative Party schedule of 
12 
events is practically identical. Avik Roy (MED '99), founder of the Con-
servative Party and publisher of Light and Truth, describes the conserva-
tive parties as "intellectual fraternities." Lila III Arzua (SY '98), Conserva-
tive Party member and editor-in-chief of Light and Truth, highlights the 
necessity of the conservative parties. "There are no structural incentives 
for conservatives at Yale," she explains. The lack of a strong traditional 
western education and the omnipresence of liberalism can mislead fresh-
men who don't know better. Arzua says that the Conservative Party and 
the POR both strive to build Great Men and Great Leaders. She argues 
that conservative organizations at Yale-parties and publications alike-
fill in missing gaps in our institution;U structure. 

A popular game among all campus conservatives is Diplomacy, a mil-
itary strategy game based on World War I. The game mirrors the disputes 
between. the conservative parties. Every player fights for his own country 
in a bartle of political adroimess. Players negotiate treaties, cut deals, and 
backstab allies. As games draw into the wee hours of the morning, Diplo-
macy addicts lament only that card and games night does not start earlier 
in the evening. As the rising sun finds POR members conniving and 
strategizing, the members seem like troops in training. Maybe these are 
the Great Leaders of whom Anua spoke: they are preparing for war. 

he debate over legitimacy becomes critical when you are a minor-
ity, and at Yale, conservatives think of themselves as just that. 
Alone, under siege, marginalized, defensive, victimized, ostra-
cized, and stereotyped. Conservatives crusade against a liberal orthodoxy 
and fight for the little man, the little man in bow tie and cuff links. The 
erosion of traditional conservative values is nothing new; since William F. 
Buckley (DC '50) searched for God at Yale in the 1950s, conservatives 
have been guarding Yale against the siege of radicalism. As the fight wears 
on, the minority mentality threatens to become a militant minority neu-
rosis. The conflict inevitably turns in on itselÂ£ Different right-wing 
groups on campus compete for the title of True Conservatives because in 
the shrinking reserve for conservatism, there is room for only one. 

Roy compares the conservative network to a community of recent 
immigrants. Like Korean immigrants in New York City who are viewed 
with suspicion by the rest of the city, Roy argues that conservatives must 
become a tight-knit community. They become self-segregators, strug-
gling to justify their existence against the majority. 

Korean immigrants draw strength from their small numbers by pool-
ing in kae. Every member contributes money to the pool and money 
from the pool is doled out on a rotating basis. lmmigran~. who could 
not normally get a loan from a bank, get a new start through the help of 
their community. Organizations that funnel money to conservative
