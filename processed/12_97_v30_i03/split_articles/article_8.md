I'm taking a study break in the Pierson 
Courtyard when an energetic Hassidic guy 
appears, smiling and shaking my hand vigor~ 
ously. His black coat and wide~brimmed hat 
dwarf his young face, making him look only 
several years past bar mitzvah age. I'm intro~ 
duced to Shmully Hecht, a 22-year~old Has~ 
sidic rabbi who holds weekly Chai society 
dinners which have developed a small but 
devoted student following over the past year 
and a half. We talk, and I'm quickly com~ 
fortable with him; he's an engaging fellow, 
not the righteous zealot I expect. "Anyway, 
what are you guys doing studying, it's Thurs~ 
day night! Aren't there any parties on cam~ 
pus?" he asks, laughing. 

Later we meet outside Taft Caffe. He 
seems quite ordinary, sipping coffee in 
his almost fashionable green jacket with 
white fringes peeking out. His wispy red 
beard dances in the wind as we chat, 
and he asks me about the Pierson Wer~ 
no and my major. Soon we're talking 
about the Chai society. "Our society is 
inspired by Lubavitch Jewish ideas," he 
explains. "The idea is to cultivate virtue 
and embrace a tradition. We aim to bring 
Judaism to the forefront of discussion." 
Shmully's eyes blaze behind his oval~shaped 
glasses as he talks. He's passionate yet easy~ 
going and full of wit, whether he's discussing 
Jewish law or public perceptions of Hassidic 
Jews. This mix of humor and religion is 
apparent in the weekly Chai society dinners, 
too: the gin and tonics flow freely, and the 
discussion of spiritual matters is as important 
as having a good time. 

Lubavitch Hassidism is an ultra-conserv~ 
ative sect within Orthodox Judaism whose 
goal is to help all Jews learn and practice the 
teachings of the Torah. People are often leery 
of Lubavitch Jews; their practice of active 
outreach, as demonstrated by the "mitzvah 
tank" on Elm Street, is often seen as prosely~ 
tizing. But Shmully has the personality, the 
sensibility, and the wit to be an effective reli~ 
gious leader on campus in spite of his group's 
reputation. At 22 he's more like an intelli~
December 3, 1997 
gent, well~spoken peer than an intimidating 
religious figure. 

While studying to become a rabbi 
berween the ages of 18 and 21, he became an 
independent trader on the Australian and 
American markets, managing huge portfo~ 
lios for wealthy clients. But when he was 
ordained as a rabbi last year, Shmully decid~ 
ed to leave the financial world. "I came to see 
a vanity and emptiness in the markets. It was 
an obsession for money." He's aware that his 
past experiences on the market are unusual 
but he downplays this part of his life. "But 
for a while I had the Beamer with the cell 
phone," he kids. In fact, he tells me later, he 
drives a Jeep Cherokee. 

Shmully grew up in a Lubavitch commu~ 
nity in Queens, New York. After receiving 
his rabbinical ordination in 1996, he carne 
to Yale, one of the few universities lacking a 
permanent Lubavitch presence. Along with 
Ben Karp (GRD '99) .and several other grad~ 
uate students, Shmully created the Chai soci~ 
ety in September 1996. "And the rest is his-
tory. We're rocking now!" he exclaims. Last 
year the group met in a Taft apartment for 
the dinners. Currently the society is on hia~ 
tus until the renovations on its new building 
on Crown Street are complete. 

In its attempt to get college kids to 
explore spiritual issues, .the Chai society's 
strategy is to be as accessible as possible. The 
society sponsors intimate weekly Sabbath 
dinners open to all, no strings attached. 
Attendees describe the Friday evening meals 
as intellectual and lively, attracting open~ 
minded thinkers of diverse religious back~ 
grounds. And Shmully is versatile enough to 
get everyone into the conversation. 

"He creates an atmosphere of cama~ 
raderie and hospitality at the dinners," says 
Christopher Thacker (DC '98), a non~Jew~ 
ish student, "He's a great entertainer and 
constan~ teacher." 

Shmully shatters preconceptions-he is 
no stodgy fundamentalist. And he~s aware 
of the stereotype people might have. As 
we're walking along he stops and holds 
my shoulders "Eli, I'm not the 
Unabomber." 

He 
grins 
like 
a 
prankster.
