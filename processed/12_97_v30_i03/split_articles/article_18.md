At C0mmon Ground High School, one of Connecticut's 12 new charter schools, 
students apply classroom skills to a working farm in West Rock. 
Breaking New Ground 
I
MAGINE GOING TO SCHOOL ON A FARM. THAT'S RIGHT, WITH 
chickens, pigs, and crops straight out of those picture books you 
had as a child. Imagine algebra on a farm. Instead of solving prob-
lems about Bill the farmer's chicken pen, students figure out how 
much fencing is needed for their own chicken pen. And then they build 
it and decide how much food their chickens need. To learn science, 
they take soil samples-not from some random din between the park-
ing lot and the football field-but from a spot of land which will soon 
be filled with this year's crop. 

Of course, agricultural schools already exist, in states which house 
active chapters of the Future Farmers of America like Ohio, and . 
Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska . . . and West Rock. West Rock, one of the 
poorest neighborhoods in New Haven, is home to Springside Farm, the 
future siteÂ· of Common Ground High School, a charter school located 
on a 20-acre plot of land in the West Rock Nature Center in northwest 
New Haven. 

On August 27, the school opened its doors for the first time. Delays 
in the construction of the new building forced Common Ground to 
begin classes on the campus of Southern Connecticut State University 
(SCSU). "It sets a nice tone for the students," says Oliver Barton (BK 
'85, FES '94), a co-founder and teacher at Common Ground. "The 
students feel like they're going to college. However, they don't realize 
that means they have to adjust their behavior and pretend they're in col-
lege while they're here." While SCSU has been good to the Common 
Ground students and teachers, the school is supposed to be on a farm, 
where they hope to be this spring. 

On October 31, the student body and other members of the New 
Haven community attended the groundbreaking ceremony at Spring-
side Farm. "The students were really excited to see so many adults who 
cared about their education," Barton said. Each student got a chance to 
shovel some dirt in preparation for the construction which is currendy 
underway. Now they have one more thing to consider on their weekly 
trips co the farm to plant garlic and build a chicken coop: the bulldozers. 

While Common Ground's temporary location prevents them from 
being on the farm daily, the school's concept remains the same. The 
curriculum is based on the principle of ecology. According to the 
school's handbook, "Common Ground's basic educational premise is 
that life and learning do not exist in discrete disciplines; the world is 
interdisciplinary." 

Thar curriculum is the mosr distinguishing characteristic of the 
school. According to Connecticut law, Common Ground is required to
