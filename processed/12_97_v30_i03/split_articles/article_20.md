seven years earlier from Mende. They told 
Gibbs that the language was Mendi, and they 
accompanied him back to l'few Haven on Sep-
tember 9. Pieh was brought before them and 
requested to tell his story. He began to speak, at 
first hesitantly and then more freely. He said 
most of the men were from Mandingo, and 
explained that he himself was born about 60 
miles inland in Africa, a son of one of the 
"principle men." While doing business, he was 
captured by his own tribesmen for an out-
standing debt and sold to King Sharks, who 
reigned in Gallinas. The king then sold him to 
the Spaniards, who forced him to leave his par-
ents, wife, and three children and put him on a 
ship secretly bound for Cuba. Pieh was asked 
whether he had aided in the enslavement of the 
others. He replied, "I would never take advan-
tage of anyone, but would always defend 
myself" Of the captain of the Amistad, Pieh 
said he was "very crud and beat them severdy." 
He described their condition in great detail. 
While Pieh's account was, on the whole, 
accurate, it was not entirely true. In fact, most 
of the Africans were from Mende, not 
Mandingo. It was not until two years later that 
the Africans admitted they-had decided to tell 
no one their true place of origin-they did not 
trust their questioners. Yet, ironically, their 
language would play a crucial role in the trial, 
and in their eventual freedom. 

"Wt want you tQ ask the court what we have done 
wrong. What for Americans keep us in prison. 

D
uring his court testimony on the 
morning of January 8, Professor Gibbs 
explained the significance of language 
in the case. In order to win, the defense knew it 
had to prove the Africans were enslaved illegiti-
mately. It could do so by proving that the 
Spaniards violated the Anglo-Spanish treaty of 
1817. But, to prove this, they had to prove the 
men were not from Cuba; they had to prove 
that the blacks were Africans. Gibbs began to 
make this case outside of the courtroom 
through the press. Gibbs himself had Covey 
teach him Mendi. After accumulating a vocab-
ulary, he communicated with the Africans. 
Gibbs showed that each of the Mende prison-
ers' names was an object, place, or thing in the 
Mendi language. He explained that if the Span-
ish had chosen African names "haphazanlly 
and given them to Africans indiscriminately, it 
would, in the multiplicity of African dialects, 
December 3, 1997 
have been a miracle for the Mendi names to fall 
so exactly on Mende people." Moreover, he 
argued that if the Spanish had taken words 
from Mende and given them to the blacks as 
names, they would have "corrupted" words 
both "in form and sound." Finally, while it was 
evident that the blacks could not speak Span-
ish, they did communicate in several African 
dialects. In court, Gibbs concluded that the 
blacks undoubtedly were "native Africans and 
recently from Africa." 

The trial's drama climaxed with Pieh's tes-
timony. One observer later recalled the room's 
"breathless attention." Pieh's testimony struck 
the audience. He lay on the floor of the court-
room to demonstrate the conditions in which 
the Africans had been placed. When he dis-
cussed the treatment of the blacks by the 
Spaniards aboard the Amistad, he told one 
account of the cook hitting him. He was asked 
whether he thought the cook might have been 
doing so in play. "Oh, no, no," he responded. 
Two other Africans testified as well. One 
of them, Grabeau, explained how the sailor 
had whipped him and others for stealing 
water, how the cook had told them they 
would be eaten after their heads had been cut 
off. Then he admitted the cook was the first 
to be killed. They hadn't wanted to kill the 
captain, but did so after he had killed one of 
the Africans. Through their testimony, the 
Mricans made it evident that their rebellion 
was one of self-defense. Their case was tried 
twice before it was taken to the U.S. Supreme 
Court where John Quincy Adams headed the 
defense. Finally, they had won their freedom. 

After the court decision, Baldwin asked 
Adams, "What shall be done with them now 
that they are free? They are separated from 
their homes by the distance of half the globe 
and in a state where they might be pitied but 
not wanted." Pieh and his fellow men returned 
to Africa, but their legacy still remains with us. 
Because they were able to be heard, and under-
stood, they attained their freedom. From the 
memorial in front of City Hall, to the recon-
struction of the Amistad currendy being built 
in Mystic, Connecticut, the story of the Amis-
tad captives' capture, rebellion, trial, and free-
dom is told and retold. Now, the story of the 
Amistad will be told in a different language, 
that native to Hollywood.
