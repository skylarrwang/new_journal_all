FOR THOSE WHO VENTURE BEYOND THE GOTHIC GATES OF THE 
Yale campus, the New Haven Green is a familiar place with 
many familiar faces. Though Steven Spielberg's is usually not 
one of them, last February it was. That was when Dream Works 
Pictures undertook the production of Amistad, a historical drama fea-
turing an international cast including Morgan Freeman and Anthony 
Hopkins. The tale is as much a story of slave rebellion as it is a story of 
Yale activism. But one does not need Hollywood to uncover the tale 
behind the dark eyes of the statue in front of City Hall.

His dark head is lifted with determination and pride. His eyes 
stare beyond the heart of the New Haven Green, and his jaw is 
firmly set. In one hand he clutches a stick; his free hand is 
pointed, bur at what? You move your hands across the scarves draped 
around the statue's shoulders; the man's loose pantaloons sway in their 
stillness. An African war helmet rests at his right foot. The pedestal 
bears the legend: "Make Us Free." The man immortalized in the dark 
December 3, 1997 
stone in front of City Hall is Sengbe Pieh, leader of the Amistad mutiny 
and rebellion. It was a hot and humid day in late August 1839 when 
Pieh was led onto the New Haven Green. He was not alone. With him 
were 39 men and three young girls. All were emaciated and confused, 
fearful and determined. They carne from New London, Connecticut, 
after being transported from Havana, Cuba. They were kidnapped 
from Africa. 

The Amistad was a small, black schooner that lefi: the port of 
Havana, Cuba by the light of the moon. Aboard it were Jose Ruiz, 
Pedro Montes, two sailors, a captain with his 16-year-old cabin boy 
named Antonio, a mulatto cook named Celestino, and 53 ladinos. 
These 49 men and four young children had recently been stolen fi:om 
Africa, and smuggled into the busy port of Havana. Bringing them to 
Cuba was a direct violation of the Anglo-Spanish Treaty of 1817 which 
prohibited the African slave trade by penalty of death. The Spaniards 
who smuggled them were well aware of this penalty. They waited anx-
iously in their vessel off shore and truSted only the night to hide their 
secret. The enslaved Africans ascended from the belly of the vessel, were 
marched into Havana by night and sold to the waiting slave traders by 
day. 

The laws were vague and enforcement was inconsistent. Though 
bringing the slaves into Cuba for trade was punishable by death, the 
sale of slaves Wrui permitted. Ruiz paid $450 
each for the 49 male slaves he chose. Montes, 
meanwhile, meticulously selected four chil-
dren. Ruiz ensured that he had papers with 
false Spanish names for each of his new buys. 

In June, the Amistad set sail for Pueno 
Principe. The Africans were crammed into 
the pit of the schooner. Each received a daily 
ration of one banana, two potatoes, and a 
small cup of water. They were abused both 
physically and verbally. Although they, did 
not share a language with their captors, the 
cook often made signs and gestures that 
vividly explairied to the captives 
that they too would end up like the 
dead pieces of beef that he cut. The 
Africans 
were 
enraged; 
they 
yearned for revenge. 

Cook say he kill, he eat Mendi peo-
p~we afraid-we kiU cook; then 
captain kiU one man with knife, and 
cut Mendi people plenty. ~ never 
kiU captain, he no kiU us .. .. AU we 
want is make us free. 

Pieh found an old nail and hid 
it, plotting silently, waiting 
anxiously. Then, finally, in the early 
morning hours, the storm came. It was the 
first of July. Pieh drove the nail into the iron 
collar that hugged his neck. He then freed the 
other captives as well. Together, they revolted. 
The cook was the first one they killed, then 
the captain. The two sailors disappeared into 
the sea, into the night. Ruiz and Antonio 
begged for their lives and were spared. Montes 
too was spared but only so that he could sail 
the captives back home, back to Africa. But 
~ where was Africa? Pieh knew only to follow 
·g the sun, and he ordered Montes to sail in its 
~ direction. But Montes and Ruiz devised a 
·g plan. By day Moores sailed into the sun, 
]? towards Africa. By night he rurned the vessel 
~ northward, towards Puerto Principe. This 
~ persisted for two months. Conditions went 
~ from miserable to unbearable. Ten of the 
~ Africans died. It was August 29, 1839 when 
:r the Amistad washed into New London. 


When Andrew T. Judson, Federal District 
~ Judge of Connecticut, went to New London 
~ to investigate the ship, something about the 
1:;' mutineers captivated him. Pieh walked into 
~ the room wearing a red flannel shin and Bow-
8 ing pantaloons. He moved his hard hands 
deliberately, making signs to Judson that 
relayed his expectation to be hung. While his 
hands acknowledged his helplessness, his eyes 
burned with hatred as they met Ruiz and 
Montes seated across from Judson. 

The Africans were awaiting trial for piracy 
and murder. Both Spaniards requested that 
the case be sent to the Spanish Consul in 
Boston, claiming that the ship, cargo, and sur-
viving ladinos were their propeny. Instead, 
Judson chose to hold the 39 African men for 
the next meeting of the grand jury of the U.S. 
Circuit Court which was scheduled for Sep-
tember. The Africans were moved to the New 
Haven jail, and the abolitionist movement 
swung into full gear. The case was more than 
a simple mutiny. It became a rallying point for 
abolitionists facing the question of slavery. in 
the United States. Were these free men or 
were they mere chattel? Could a black man 
count for more than three-fifths of a person? 

New London abolitionist Dwight P. Janes 
wrote to Yale graduate, lawyer, and editor of 
the Emancipator, Roger S. Baldwin, urging 
him to take on the defense. Baldwin was no 
newcomer to constitutional law, nor to New 
Haven. Born in the Elm City in 1793, Bald-
win graduated from Yale with honors at the 
age of 18. He was the grandson of Roger 
Sherman who was a signer of the Declaration 
oflndependence and a delegate at the Consti-
tutional Convention, and, ironically, a key fig-
ure in maintaining the legality of slavery with-
in the Constitution. However, the tides had 
turned, and Baldwin found that he was not 
alone in his abolitionist zeal. The Amistad 
Committee was formed to raise money for the 
Africans' legal counsel and to see that their liv-
ing needs were met. The abolitionists under-
stood that in order to make Americans sym-
pathetic to the Africans' case, the American 
people must first recognize them as human 
beings. The committee visited the jail often, 
writing reports that were primed and reprint-
ed in the press. They strategically worked 
towards changing the public image of the 
Africans. Konoma, one of the Africans, had 
noticeably protruding teeth. To erase the 
rumors that linked his teeth with cannibal-
ism, the committee wrote that he used these 
teeth in his attempts to attract women. 

' Whether or not the information was rele-
vant, whether or not it made much sense, 
the papers printed it. Soon, spec-
tators from miles away huddled 
outside the jail to catch a glimpse 
of the imprisoned men. Not only 
did the Africans regard Pieh as 
their natural leader, but the pub-
lic did as well. The American 
journalists praised his air of grace 
and poise; he was callea "another 
Othello." But the comminee 
knew that winning the emotion 
of the public could only take 
them so far. 

The real batde 
would need to be fought in the 
courtroom, and it would have_to 
be done on legal terms. To do so, the 
Africans' story had to be heard, and more 
importantly, their story had to be under-
stood. 

Dear friend, we want you to know how we fieL 
Mendi people think, think, think. Nobody know 
what we think. 

Josiah W Gibbs, a Yale professor of lin-
guistics, made communication possible. 
Gibbs often observed the prisoners as they 
were taken onto the New Haven Green for 
exercise. One day, he approached them, raised 
his fingers up in the air arid counted in Eng-
lish. After some confusion, the Africans began 
to count his fingers as well, but they did so in 
their own language. Gibbs learned their words 
for numbers and took this new knowledge to 
the New York and New Haven ports. He 
paced the waterfronts repeatedly, yelling out 
their words for numbers. Finally, he found 
two men who understood. They were work-
ing on the British warship, Buzzard, docked 
in the busy New York pon. They were James 
Covey, a former slave from Sierra Leone, and 
Charles Pratt, who himself had been seized
