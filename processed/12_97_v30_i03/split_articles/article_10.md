It's the last rehearsal before the Home-
less Theater Troupe's opening night of 
Angelic Greeting. Director Jane Chen OE 
'98) describes the final production touch. 
She wants the audience to interact with the 
actors as they enter Nick Chapel. Her plan 
is for members of the audience to enter 
through the backstage door and pass the 
troupe members hanging out onstage. 

Troupe member Tony Alves gives Jane a 
skeptical 
look. 
"Why 
don't we just sit in the 
audience until we start 
the show?" Tony asks. 

Jane doesn't like the idea, 
and producer Laurie Ken-
nington (BR '99) men-
tions the lack of extra 
chairs. "Then we'll get up 
when people come," Tony persists, pretend-
ing to politely relinquish his seat and gar-
nering comments of agreement from the 
other actors. Jane still looks doubtful, but 
consents to Tony's plan. When the plan is 
put into action on opening night, the actors 
comfortably mingle with audience mem-
bers, many of whom were unaware of the 
actors' identity until they left their seats to 
go backstage. Stephanie Escajeda (TC '98), 
a student actor in Angelic Greeting, says 
while audience response was difficult to 
gauge, the actors' presence tied in well the-
matically with the troupe's attempts to 
break down the walls between the troupe 
members and other community members. 

"I've been really impressed that students 
and troupe members interact on an equal 
basis," Laurie says. The troupe's "work 
nights," which Laurie organizes, typifY this 
unusual relationship. Every Thursday, the 
troupe members, all of whom are homeless 
or formerly homeless, work together with 
Yale students on administrative tasks like 
publicity and fundraising. When the troupe 
has raised enough money, it will hire a 
troupe member as a replacement for soon-
. to-graduate Jane. 

Laurie 
expresses 
surprise 
at 
how 
impressed people, particularly grant admin-
istrators, are with the easy interaction 
between students and troupe members on 
work nights. She recalls only one contrast-
ing scene when she and Jane had to make an 
executive 
decision 
about light design 
because no one else fully understood the 
factors involved. "I guess that's the excep-
tion that proves the rule," she says. The 
troupe's mode of cooperation, which con-
trasts so sharply with the benefactor-benefi-
ciary paradigm of most community service, 
feels natural to its participants. During the 
post-performance talkback, troupe member 
Donna Fields says, "We're homeless, but 
we're not helpless"-a theme that runs 
through all the troupe's workings and one 
that working with the troupe helped her to 
realize. 

A few weeks later at a work night, 
Andree Thompson, busy writing a press 
release, looks up to say "This is beautiful." 
Krissy Clark (ES '98) agrees. "There's so 
much energy in here!" "It's not about hand-
outs or 'the capable:' and 'the needy,"' Krissy 
writes. "Working side by side toward a com-
mon goal, all the members of the troupe-
students and actors-benefit."
