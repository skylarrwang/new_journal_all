groups on campus justifY themselves similarly. Ar this strange and 
unfriendly university, conservative students would have no chance. Our 
curriruJum is diluted by diversity, our professors are overgrown leftovers 
&om the 1960s, and everyone speaks the weird tongue of political cor-
rectness. Conservatives have become foreigners in their own land. 
However, in a crucial way, conservatives still have an immeasurable 
advantage over Korean immigrants. Korean immigrants have no choice 
but to stick together. Koreans can't get loans from the bank, oonservatives 
seem to own it. Although oonservatives are numerically a minority on our 
campus, their influence is disproportionately large due to the financial 
and institutional support they receive from conservative organizations 
fighting to restore the old order. When conservatives talk of returning to 
better times (i.e., 1950s America, or maybe 1950 B.C.), they sound like 
}aoobires in eighteenth century Britain plorting to revive the f.illen House 
of Stuarts. The comparison is not actually that far-fetched. After all, every 
chairman of the PO R must wear a medal dedicated to Charles I, the infa-

Although many of the wealthiest oonservative foundations are well-
known for their support of think tanks and advocacy groups, the 
largest portion of their money is acrually directed towards influ-
encing universities and academic life. In a study done by the National 
Committee for Responsible Philanthropy, almost one half of all oonserva-
rive foundation grants went to academic institutions of which Yale 
received the fourth largest share. Between 1992 and 1994, Yale received 
approximately $5.9 million dolJa.rs in grant money fiom oonservarive 
foundations for projects ranging from academic programs to farulty 
endowments. However, the most immediately felt impact of oonservarive 
money is direccly on students. 

The largest and most influential group among campus oonservarives 
is the Intercollegiate Studies Institute (lSI). Although their official mis-
