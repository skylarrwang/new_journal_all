**Title: Wanna Fly?**

"Wannafiy?" 
The question sounds psychedelic, but it raises a series of mundane 
questions. Do I want to learn how to By a plane? How much time will 
it take? Is it dangerous? How far away is the airport? Is there a bus to 
take me there? 

The question has a very different ring when asked while 5,000 feet 
over the Alaskan countryside by a pilot eagerly handing you the con-
trols to a plane. 

It was through this spontaneous act by a daring Alaskan bush pilot 
Â«; that I was introduced to flying. It was more than enough to get me 
c: :; hooked. In the few minutes before the controls were plucked from my 
0 -; hands, I tasted freedom.

This sort of freedom is well and good in Alaska, where you can eas-
~ ily be a hundred miles from the nearest road. Back home in New York 
~ City, there is barely room to park, much less take off and land. So, my 
.~ first round of Bight instruction had to be postponed until an end-of-
'; summer trip co Long Island.

I learned to my dismay that flying is popular on Long Island, and 
~ the instructor called me to say that he's fully booked. Well, he said, all 
~ but 6 a.m. I took the offer in a second.

I caught a cab to the airport and arrived ten minutes early. Soon 
enough, a plane landed, taXied over, and the instructor hopped out. 
After a tutorial covering how planes fly, and a preflight inspection of the 
airplane, we were tip in the air. 

I have since learned that a good instructor makes the novice student 
feel as though he is flying the airplane, and I, for one, was fooled com-
pletely. Sensing only gentle assistance from the instructor on the con-
trols, "I" took us around the neighborhood and along the beach. I 
learned the layout of the now-familiar control and instrument panel, 
and we did some basic climbs, descents, and turns. Towards the end of 
the lesson, we were even able to locate a number of familiar local land-
marks. Were we waking people up while buzzing around at 7 a.m.? I 
certainly didn't care. 

I spent the months before winter break grounded in New York, 
lazily staring at my precious 2.3 logged hours and devouring anything 
written about flying. I learned the phonetic alphabet, the system by 
which letters and numbers are communicated dearly across the radio. 
The alphabet runs from Alpha through Zulu. The numbers are normal 
with the exception of the somewhat famous "Niner." I also subscribed 
co Flying magazine, which I still read. 

By the time winter break rolled around, I was aware of most of the 
topics a pilot needs co know--only I had no flight experience. 

Winter break was my first opportunity to solidify my flying knowl-
edge. My family went away to Arizona where flying time is cheap and 
plentiful, and I loved every minute of it. By the trip's end I had a good

chunk of knowledge and experience about the basics of flying, not to 
mention having logged 14 hours in the cockpit. My newfound experi-
ence ranged from getting the plane through the air smoothly, to per-
forming a preflight inspection. This had also been my first time speak-
ing to the control tower, which is the most basic unit of air traffic con-
trol (ATC). I still find ATC incredibly cool because nothing quite says 
"flying" like "Scottsdale tower, Cessna 55374, holding shon of the 
active runway at Bravo for nonheast departure." I was also pulling off 
some fairly decent landings. Landing is the hardest pan of flying. It 
requires slowing down enough so that the wings lose their lift, but only 
within inches of the runway so that the plane doesn't smack down too 
hard. A bad landing causes a loud crash and the seats to hit up against 
you as the plane drops onto the runway. A good landing leaves the 
plane rolling calmly and effortlessly down the runway. 

Upon my return to New York, my enthusiasm only deepened. I 
continued to read everything I could about flying. Despite my wistful 
glances up at clear skies on cold winter days (ideal for flying), Bight 
training was again postponed, this time until spring break. Over break, 
I made it up to 32 hours, and on the second to last day I was endorsed 
by my instructor to By solo-if, he cautioned, the winds stayed down 
for my final day. I checked the Weather Channel constantly that night 
and was greeted by healthy gusts the next morning. Despite some 
beautiful landings in a crosswind, I wasn't allowed to solo. 

I finally brought together my sporadic training of the last year this 
past summer. Towards the end, I flew as often as several times a week. I 
mostly practiced things I had learned before, but I also experienced 
Approach Control, a new facet of ATC. If you are flying from one 
place to another, you can request "Bight following." This means a con-
troller will watch you on radar and attempt to keep you clear of other 
planes, and clear you through any controlled airspace which might be 
in your path. 

My summer culminated with two solo flights. People often ask 
about the meaning of solo. "All by yourself? Really?" Really. Solo means 
solo, I reply, but even I was surprised by the lack of supervision on the 
second solo. All by myself, I got the keys from the desk, did a preflight 
inspection, started the engine, took off, flew, and landed. At every stage, 
it was a shock not to have anyone in the copilot seat watching and 
checking everything I did. But I hadn't felt independence until I'd 
flown in a plane which was solely my responsibility. After a year of 
obsessing, I was finally there, flying an airplane. 

I was eager to continue my flying as soon as I got to Yale. Unfonu-
nately, because of my schedule and weather, I only recently began flying 
here. The Yale Flying Club has planes that I've never flown before, and 
it will be a few hours before I'm soloing again. I can't wait-straight up 
seems like an excellent direction to go to escape the hubbub of campus 
for a while. 

Flying also inspired me to take a meteorology course here at Yale. 
We've all moaned about how our life is never going to depend, say, on 
our ability to solve a multi-variable equation. The excitement of meteo-
rology, for me, is that my life may actually rest one day on my knowl-
edge of this course material, such as whether a storm will be forming in 
my Bight path. 

On the ground, I sometimes kick myself to keep from going on for 
hours about the wonders of ATC, visual flight rules, wing Haps, land-
ing, or anything else. But of course, the real fun is being up there, cruis-
ing along, and having it all come together. There are lots of places to By 
around New Haven, but as we have all heard, it's the joutney, not the 
destination, that is irnponant. Being able to make the journey at 5,500 
feet makes it only bener.
