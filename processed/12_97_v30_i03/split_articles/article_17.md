pushes me for details. "Is your parcel per-
ishable or non-?" 
Oefinitely perishable. 
"What kind of perishable?" It's a big plant, 
I inform them. "What kind of plant?" 
Uh ... it's a big bush. "Sir, what are the 
dimensions of this bush?" I hang up. 
ABF Freight says they'll deliver an 
international parcel, but it would involve 
riding in a "really big crate," stacked along 
with thousands of other crates, on the deck 
of a cargo ship for a few days. 

After calling another half-dozen ship-
ping companies, I switch tactics and start 
trying more standard delivery services. The 
thrill of the hunt is exhilarating-sweat 
beads on my face and drips onto my cheap 
Radio Shack phone. 

UPS is a no-go. U.S. Delivery says 
they'll deliver a 200-pound package in four 
to six hours for $359.50, but it involves 
riding in the cargo chute of a commercial 
airplane. Their insurance isn't so hot, 
either. FedEx will do it, but only for $987. 
Of course, I don't actually tell them that I 
want to send a human through the mail, 
but the prices are nonetheless pretty steep. 

I finally hit gold with Yellow Freight, a 
trucking company. They'll do it for 
$148.10. This is only a small savings over 
regular airfare; my parents would be 
pleased. However, the trip would take four 
days in the cargo bed of a smelly, diesel-
powered truck with significant danger of 
freezing to death at night. I would soon 
learn the limits of continental freight deliv-
ery. Shivering, surrounded by strange, dark 
boxes and bumping around in the truck, I 
would yearn for my days with Mr. Rhine-
hart and the good old USPS.
