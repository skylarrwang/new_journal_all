Accursed Verse 
For aspiring poets, Yale University Press' Inferno is sheer torment. 
by j essica W inter 
N THE MIDDLE OF THEIR JOURNEY, THEY CAME TO A 
dark landing-on a little-used back staircase at Yale 
University Press-where the straight way was lost. Here, 
cobwebs traverse the corners of the walls. The overhead 
light has gone out, so that any pilgrim to the Yale Press 
building who wishes to glimpse the refuge of the damned 
must make do with the dim glare filtering through the 
single dingy window. Someone has tossed a · Fig Newton 
wrapper-a mark of disdain, ~scar of defeat-
into one of 
the 17 mailbins lining the musty walls. Most of the bins 
are labeled with construction paper guideposts, magic-
markered " INFERNo" and "PURGATORro" ; one lone box, 
which sits exalted above the rest on a rickety, abandoned desk, carries · 
the tag " PARADISO." 

All of the bins are stuffed with manuscript submissions to the Yale 
Series ofYounger Poets competition, which each year selectS an unpub-
lished poet under age 40 whose manuscript is plucked from the vulgar 
herd and published in book form. The labels, alas, seem but a.cruel 
mockery now. So does the epigraph to the portrait of long-dead Yale 
patron Earl Trumbull Williams that hangs above the poetic sinners lan-
guishing on the floor: "H is strength sprang from the cleanness of his 
heart." For this year, at the decree of newly-appointed judge and 
Minos, W S. Merwin, all submissions have been consigned to Hell. 

Merwin and Yale Press announced that they had abandoned all 
hope through a press release issued shortly after Merwin's O ctober deci-
sion. Isaac Cates (GRD '00) echoes their statement when he explains, 
"There is not a winner in the Yale Series of Younger Poets this year not 
because there were no good submissions but because there were no uni-
formly great ones." Cates is one of a dozen readers, a group mostly 
comprised of graduate students in the English department, who whit-
tled 700 applicants down to 15 finalists. Cates speculates that if the late 
James Dickey, who judged the series between 1990 and 1996, were still 
presiding, one of the manuscripts would have found redemption at the 
typesetter's-he was, after all, the author of Deliverance. "Merwin is 
putting his mark on the series by holding each manuscript to really 
high standards," Cates says. Another reader, Stephen Burt (GRD '01) 
concurs, "The bottom line is not 'Poets are getting worse,' but 'Yale 
Series ofYounger Poets has a new judge."' 

Merwin's decision forced an abrupt end to an arduous selection 
process whose way is long and road is hard. Back in February, like Vir-
gil's apprentices, the readers began guiding the submissions toward 
their respective fates according to Dante's system of the afterlife, a clas-
sifying scheme instated three years ago by Yale Series sponsoring editor 
Richard Miller (GRD '57). "Eighty percent of the manuscripts make 
it to Inferno within th.ree readings," Miller estimates. 

"Once a few more people have gone through the 
remaining poems, then Purgatorio needs to be purged. 
That's when Inferno overflows." Indeed, this year many 
exiles from Purgatorio were shipped to "INFERNO LAKES 
(bedroom community for those who work in Inferno)," 
located in another room of the Yale Press building. After 
Merwin rejected a first batch of finalists, the readers per-
formed a Harrowing of Hell, plucking six manuscripts 
from the depths like so many Rachels, Noahs, and Abra-
hams. Merwin forsook these, too. Just as all involved 
were losing hope of the. ascent, Yale &view editor J. D. 
McClatchy (GRD '74) presented Merwin with a few manuscripts he 
himself had solicited. Merwin gave one his blessing, but higher-ups at 
Yale Press intervened, arguing they could not award the prize to any 
poet whose collection had not followed the same procedural channels 
as the hundreds of other applicants. (This phantom manuscript, pure 
of heart but knowing not the ways of those On High, presumably rests 
its weary frame in the first circle with the Virtuous Heathens: those 
who are guiltless but without hope.) 

Miller, Cates, and Burt are all quick to point out that Merwin's edict 
is hardly unprecedented in the competition's 78-year history. During his 
12 years as judge, W H. Auden gave no award on two occasions. But 
Auden's tenure also produced a remarkable string of soon-to-be great 
shades: Adrienne Rich, John Ashbery (who beat out Frank O'Hara), 
James Wright, John Hollander (Hon. MA '77), and Merwin himself, 
among others. Recent years have produced no such notables; last year's 
winner Talvikki Ansel's My Shining Archipelago was scourged by critics. 
But Burt points out, "As opposed to novels, it takes a while for people to 
see when a book of poems is really important. The people who have 
won in the last few years have not been super-celebrat~, and it could be 
they're not very good, or it could be it just takes a while. Auden was a 
special case, but even with Auden, some of his selections were hit by 
trucks, some became John Hollander. But no one in 1957 was saying 
that John Hollander was a great poet. It's only visible in retrospect." 

Just as many published poets must spend some time in lit-crit Pur-
gatorio before ascending the sunny hill, unpublished scribes hope that 
a retrospective glance at their work will allow them to attain the lofty 
seat; as Cates points out, "We get a lot of resubmissions from year to 
year. That's especially encouraging this year, beca.use there were a few I 
wouldn't have minded publishing, but none that couldn't have used a 
year's worth of revising." Those thousands of poems awaiting recycling 
in a dusty corner of Yale Press, it seems, have some recourse. After all, 
revision is its own penitence.
