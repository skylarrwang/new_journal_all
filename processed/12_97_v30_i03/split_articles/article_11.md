EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Tucked away neatly on the third floor of 
246 Church Street is a harmless-looking 
room complete with the standard adorn-
ments of any Yale office where Important 
Business is conducted. Month-old issues of 
Ntwswuk and Good Housekuping, sterile 
pink wallpaper interrupted by an occasional 
Monet print, and the familiar background 
noise of office workers amiably chatting greet 
the casual visitor. 


However, room 305, the Student Loans 
Office, is the site of unique 
Important Business. I've been 
summoned to this room by a 
number of e-mails politely 
informing me (read: threat-
ening) that I've yet to view a 
mandatory 30-minute Staf-
ford loan video describing 
my rights and responsibil-
ities as a recipient of fed-
eral largess. Litde do I 
know that I've come to 
room 305 for an after-
noon of unexpected 
hilarity. 


After a 
brief 
meeting with the 
secretary at the 
front desk informing me 
that the video will begin shortly, I take a 
chair near several other tired-looking stu-
dents. "You here for the video?" one asks. He 
responds co my nod with a look of knowing 
sympathy and mutual annoyance. 


Several minutes pass before the eight of 
us are finally led to the mysterious room. 
After being given a "Statement of Under-
Standing" with an ominous checklist of regu-
lations we're supposed to agree to, an almost 
frighteningly concerned 
loan counselor 
enters. She reminds us several times that 
we're not only allowed but expected to ask 
any questions we might have about the loan 
process. Following a span of silence and visi-
ble impatience from the small crowd, the 
door is closed and the film starts. 


The Sallie Mae corporate seal proudly 
graces the screen for an instant before fading 
into footage of a bustling eollege campus. No 
expense has been spared in the video's 
attempt to recreate a college environment: 
pennants, canned and vibrant frisbee players, 
even student slang. The film begins to take 
December 3, 1997 -
form with a diverse group of young people, 
all attired in regular college garb, appearing 
one after another on a carefully constructed 
set. Each, of course, has their own scripted 
wisdom co impart co the captivated and 
financially aided members of the audience. 


But instead of eliciting polite attention or 
bored ·disinterest, the Stafford loan video 
becomes laughable as its cast members' 
advice strays farther and farther from reality 
and becomes a ridiculous attempt to connect 
with college students. 


"Pay attention! Definitely pay attention 
to your loan officer. I never really did, and 
now I regret it," I'm warned by Robert, the 
first of many annoyingly helpful students 
interviewed. Robert's outstretched, pointed 
finger and didactic words earn giggles instead 
of alarm from a girl sitting behind me. 


"You have to know what you're getting 
into. It's very important that you read the 
paperwork. Read, read, read. Read how 
much you have to pay back. It's a contract, 
you know. Probably your first," is the advice 
of a serious woman named Susan. I'm unable 
to keep from smirking at Susan and Robert's 
assumption of our third-grade comprehen-
sion level. Other grins of amusement, if not 
outright laughs of derision, are slowly emerg-
ing from the small audience. 


"Check off that you understand every-
thing, but don't be afraid to ask questions if 
you have 
them," 
are Robert's further 
reminders. "You should only get a loan if you 
need it. I remember signing up for an extra 
thousand here and there, and now I really 
regret it. I mean, don't mess around." Robert 
shakes his head from side to side in remorse, 
as if to emphasize the point. 


Furthering the guide. to avoiding com-
mon 
student financial 
messups, 
John 
describes how he foolishly used his student 
loans "co buy pepperoni pizza every night for 
an entire year." He laughs at his error and 
smacks his own forehead. "What a mistake." 


"Buy 'em with mushrooms next time," an 
unimpressed audience member shoots back. 


Perhaps sensing the futility of a staid loan 
agency relating to college students, the camera 
cuts to Arthur, a balding, suspendered 
accountant working late in a dimly lit (Sallie 
Mae, presumably) office. Utilizing a threaten-
ing rather chan helpful ap-proach, 
Arthur has even more 
to 
expl~n and 
warn us o£ Slowly, 
huge 
words 
flash 
across 
the 
screen, 
as 
we're 
taken through the 
Student Loan Basics: 
FORBEARANCE. 
LOAN 
CONSOLIDATION. 
DEFERMENT. 


"So pay them back," 
Arthur intones. "It's not a 
good idea to fall back on 
your payments. You might 
not be able to buy a car or a 
house." Robert and Susan 
nod in agreement. "You could 
even 
permanently 
damage 
your credit record. You're not just hurting 
yourself, you're hurting others. It could 
come back to haunt you." 


"Sallie Mae and the Mafia never forget," 
comes from the back of the room. 


The screen fades to black as the loan 
officer reenters the room. "Was the video 
informative?" she asks hopefully. "Oh, 
yeah," one of us offers. "A real riot." 


Pleased, she hands back copies of our state-
ments of understanding and asks Xsurprise, 
surprise) if we have any questions before 
signing. 


Eight hands collect pens and bookbags 
and race for the door without a peep.
