pieces, works we have come to expect of 
art in the African tradition. Figurines sit 
singularly encased under glass, and curator's 
notes dot the wall beneath a map of north-
western Africa. We have walked into '1\rt: 
That Is Exhibited: Museum· Masterpieces," 
the opening of Baule: African Art/Western Eyes 
at the Yale University Art Gallery. Gathered 
here, for the first time, is an assembly of art-
work from this region of the Ivory Coast, 
Baule Country, representing an ethnic group 
of over one million people. Susan Vogel, for-
mer director of the museum, brought this cul-
mination of her personal research to the 
gallery in an attempt to redefine the Western 
notions of looking at African art. And that is 
exactly what we as visitors do; we look, exam-
ine, critique the line, the form, the detail, and 
the tone that each piece sets in this first 
themed segment. We do so instinctively, play-
ing directly into Vogel's hands. Our initial 
reactions teach us a lesson in the end-about 
our Western-ness, our assumptions, and ulti-
mately about ourselves. 

The first portion of Baule is placed rather 
unassumingly near the entrance of the muse-
um-not in a separate room, but in the lobby 
itsel£ We encounter this first section with the 
impression that it is unremarkable--we read 
the historical backgrounds on the walls, circle 
the installments, scribble notes in a lined pad. 
There is only a hint that this art will be chal-
lenging, because it comes from a different cul-
tural tradition and also because its presenta-
tion, even now, is a little different. The labels 
are less pretentious than the ones in the 
gallery on the museum's second Boor. They 
tell us what each piece is, where it originated, 
by whom it was donated, and the cultural sig-
nificance that it possesses, but that is all. The 
focus is on the bare analysis. We are left to 
look. But we've been well trained. We fill in 
the pretension that the labels have left out and 
walk on. 

The lighting changes. A screen on the 
opposite wall plays a videotape and the music, 
chant-like, seeps into our ears. ·Palms start 
sweating. In this next section, all of the pieces 
are not housed under glass cases. They aren't 
stilted and displayed like the classic Greek 
sculpture that we're used to seeing on the floor 
below. Here, there is raffia, cloth, texture. It 
makes us nervous. One half of the room is 
"Art That Is Glimpsed: Spirit Spouses." The 
intricately carv~ figures are the personal pos-
sessions of the Baule people, representing the 
other half of themselves, the spouses left in 
the womb the moment they were born. They 
are not meant to be seen by other people. 
They are private creations. We wipe our 
hands on our jeans and wonder what has 
become of those people whose spirit spouses 
are here, at the Yale University Art Gallery, far 
away from the Ivory Coast and their other 
halves. We sit for a moment with the smaller 
spouses, made for children, and read the 
admonition on the wall: "The original pur-
pose of a Baule figure can only be known 
while it is in its original context." But we are 
not on the Ivory Coast, we are in New Haven. 
Understanding the concept of Baule art with-
in both its own context and a Western one is 
the central task. It is this duality that Vogel 
has carefully constructed and attempts to 
drive home with graceful subtlety. 

Behind a thin muslin-like screen, a mask 
materializes out of darkness. It is Banked by 
large, colorfully batiked swaths of cloth, the 
scene derived from the videotape playing 
nearby. The music has gotten louder. We have 
crossed the room to "An That Is Watched: 
Entertainment Masks," but have begun to 
understand that . the watching is inappropri-
ate. Notes from Koffi Nguessan, a Baule 
artist who helped Vogel with the eXhibit and 
its accompa!ying book, explain that Baule 
artists seek to surprise with their work and, 
in ·that tradition, the Baule mask is never 
openly displayed. It is revealed, quite elabo-
rately and only fleetingly, during entertain-
ment dances and is then wrapped up and put 
away until the next time it is used. The 
masks hanging here in the gallery are unnat-
urally displayed. They are naked, staked to 
the cases, unprotected from appraising eyes. 
It is a painful sight. 

Through the corridor that connects the 
two parts of the exhibit, we find time to 
breathe but are unprepared for what is co 
come next. We encounter '1\rt That Is 
Observed With Awe: The Sacred." The cura-
tor's notes for this section remind us that these 
objects are kept in sanctified spaces. They are 
not made for public eyes. It is Baule tradition 
to divide the sacred along gender lines; men 
and women each have their own versions. On 
the female side the divine is captured in adya-
nun, the sacred women's dance, the collective 
property of women that men are forbidden to 
see. For the men there are bo nun amuin, or 
the men's gods, objects that women are for-
bidden to see. 

A young woman stands transfixed, indeci-
sive before this next, most powerful segment 
of the exhibit. Behind. her head a videotape 
plays showing Baule trance diviners, the 
intensity of the dancers' performance escalat-
ing with her anxiety over what to do next. She 
is faced with a choice. The space is fractured: 
women's ceremonies are behind one wall, 
men's behind another. She stands before a sign 
that reads, "Baule men do not want women to 
see their sacred objects." Behind her another 
sign reads, "Baule women do not want men to 
see their sacred ceremonies." She chooses not 
to enter. She makes the conscious decision to 
leave the male space unviolated. 

Her decision is perhaps the most intense 
moment that can be experienced through art: 
something that calls for comprehensive self-
reflection and self-location as both viewer and 
cultural outsider. To encounter a space that 
one culture holds so dearly calls attention to 
our own strangeness, the particularity of the 
Western psyche. The sense of being an out-
sider is acute. We are both male and female in 
this space, ghost-walking through someone 
else's sacred world. Our alienation comes 
from our assumptions about why we deserve 
to be there. 

The last section reinforces the sense of dis-
placement. With the tide ''Art That Is Dis-
played: Decorative Objects," the theme of the 
exhibit's final segment makes us realize that 
these pieces are the only enes that we should 
have been able to view all along. The placards 
inform us that Baule artists spend the majori-
ty of their time creating functional objects, 
simply because they are the only pieces that 
are seen and can be acclaimed. Here, almost 
tucked in as an afrerthought, is the only art 
that the Baule people would have seen in our 
Western way. We feel the callousness of what 
we have done. 

Looking back, though, it is difficult to 
accept Vogel's critique of our ways of seeing. 
We recognize its validity, but realize that she 
asks a great deal of us. Exiting the museum it 
is inevitable that we look through our West-
ern eyes. We have been touched viscerally by 
the experience, but are still muddling through 
its intellectual and personal significance. We 
have spent time looking and in that process 
have been forced to confront our own pre-
sumption. Bauk has left us questioning on a 
broader scale what else, beyond simply 
African An, we have been misrepresenting 
and mishandling with Western Eyes.
