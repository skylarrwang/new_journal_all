W ith graffiti as their weapon, suburban teenagers 
battle police for ownership of the streets. 
''GOD OF A BITCH SPELLED BACKWARDS IS A RUN DOG." 
Â· For years this phrase from New Havens Gang of Four 
' 
adorned the brick wall facing the entrance to Ezra 
Stiles College. All those who passed it knew the 
bunch; their names were as much fixtures of the landscape as their per-
plexing phrase, And while the Barnes and Noble powerwashers have 
erased the paint, the contusing phrase still lingers in people's minds-a 
symbol qf the Elm Oty's mysterious graffiti culture. 


To understand the lure of graffiti in New Haven, one must first 
become familiar with the key concepts. These are the players: the graffi-
ti artists and the police. lieutenant Joe Polio to be specific, head of the 
New Haven Police Department Graffiti Team. We have the stage: the 
''legal wall" near Acme Furniture on Crown Street. And finally, the lan-
guage of the scene: bombing, tagging, and posting. Now we're ready to 
begin. 


I
t is unusually busy at 3 p.m. at Cafenine on State Street, but when 
you mention graffiti, people stop and acknowledge you with a 
knowing nod of the head. Mike Reichbart, the owner of the bar, is 
~ the man I'm looking to speak with, but it seems like everyone has a 
:g story ro tell. Ace, the cook, is first; he asks me if I've seen the legal wall 
~ out back. Leg<l1 wall? ''Yeah, mats where all the great stuff is," he says. 
~ "The Acme Furniture guy lets kids spraypaint the side of his building. 
~ That's why it's called legal, 'cause no one complains." 


"Yeah," interrupts Sara, the waitress. "Its amazing. Just recently 
~ these kids carne out here and were putting up a new mural for a mend 
&. who died. There were like 15 of them working on it. Moms and aunts 
8 
were out there. They had a bUnch of puppies so I went after work and 
people were just hangin' out and painting. It was real nice, playing with 
the puppies and watching these guys put that mural up. They must 
have been there all day." 


I find Mike and he takes me outside to reveal the setting of every-
one's stories--an empty parking lot closed off by a black chainfink 
fence. Yellow signs warn "No Trespassing: Violators Will Be Prosecut~ 
ed," but the fence presenrs lirde more than an annoyance. With a weak 
push, it rolls back easily. 


This is a parking lot without cars. Instead, the asphalt sttVes as a 
morgue for spraycan tops. Discarded rollers. paint pans, old .rags, and 
an occasional beer bottle litter the ground. Putpte, gold, black, blue, 
green: every color of spraypaint lays it:S claim to this space. 


On the right side of the lot, the walls are covered with the m.onikl:rs 
of graffiti artists: ERA, Duo J, CDE, OMS, BPt ct "See that over 
there?" Mike says pointing to the last tag. "That means Bridgeport. 
Connecticut. These guys come from all over the place to spray h~. I 
see them late at night spraying. MOSt of them are good kids-you 
wouldn't mind having them as sons.'' 


As Mike continues to point out the tagJ he is familiar wim, he sys-
tematically points out what is not graffiti. "see that over there?" he says, 
indicating a scribble of white on the hack wall. "Now see, that's just 
vandalism, that's not graffiti.'' The distinction he makes is curious, bur 
has its own logic. Graffiti culture has its own handbook which separates 
it from mere vandalism. To those combatting graffiti, it ~ all the same, 
but for insiders like Mike the difference is the visual dfect on the view-

ible writing, when compared to graffiti's use of bold colors and studied 
style of script. 


"Well, what's that?" I ask, pointing to graffiti that I soon learn is a 
proclamation of war. The words, "Independent Optics Only," have 
been scrawled over some older graffiti. "That's bad," Mike says. In the 
language of the paint, a challenge to fight has been declared. "See, any-
time someone purs their tag over another tag, that means they're look-
ing to start something." 


But while war is announced on one side of the parking lot, the 
opposite side mourns the dead. "Seme RIP," one portion of the wall 
wishes. Next to it is another memorial: "In Memory of Brian Rorick." 
Inside the purple and green bubble letters "PIB," the words "Rest Easy" 
are printed. Mike doesn't know what PIB stands for, and the three-
pronged crown atop the I is a mystery. But this memorial is a tempo-
rary one. "These walls have been repainted at least 20 times," Mike 
says. "Each time a new kid comes, he breaks out a roller and goes over 
the old stuff and bam! purs his stuff up right after." This mural holds 
Brian's place here for a short while, at least until the next roll down. 


"It's a shame really," Mike says, "They ought to do this stuff on can-
vas, but I guess that's the whole point. You do it, some people photo-
graph it, everyone you want to see it does, and then boom! you paint 
over it and start again." 


At the top of the wall-one can still make out "Pedro" underneath a 
thin <:oat of whitewash. In place of the E is a menacing face whose eyes 
and beard appear dearly. "See up there? They covered that up already. 
It's like some sort of continuous artform, always changing. It's amazing 
how you can make a spraycan talk like that." 


December 3, 1997 
For the first time someone has used the word art to describe the 
wall, but little mention is made of the land feud being waged over the 
canvas. According to Lieutenant Polio, the legal wall presenrs irs own 
problems. While AI Greenberg of the Acme Furniture Company has no 
qualms with the paint-happy youth, the parking lot owners do not 
share his enthusiasm for this form of expression. The Catch-22 is this: 
how does one paint on a legal wall when one has to invade private 
property to get to it? "It's difficult ro call it criminal trespassing," Polio 
says, "The owners of the two properties need to work it out between 
themselves." In the meantime, Mike laughs. "They think this fence is 
gonna stop someone. Did it stop us? We just walked right in." 


"The kids aren't looking for trouble for the most part," Mike con-
cludes as we leave the parking lot. One last look at the wall and we slip 
back through the chain link fence. 


But the graffiti isn't just on the legal wall. After an introduction to 
the language of graffiti the eye learns to read the urban landscape. All 
along the buildings from Cafenine to the Tune Inn there are scrawlings, 
tags. Now the initials are familiar: CDE, DMS, ERA. Then there is the 
most prominent of all, on the second floor of the Chapel Square Mall 
in white bubble letters surrounded by red and blue lines: VERSE. 


( ( v
erse is worth a dinner," Polio says from behind Ius desk at 
City Hall. "The guy who turned in DMS got a lunch, but 
Verse, he's worth a dinner. I was promised him by someone." 


"They're going to deliver Verse?" an officer in the room asks. 


"Yeah, that's what they said," Polio beams. 


A conversation with the lieutenant quickly reveals the srrange
