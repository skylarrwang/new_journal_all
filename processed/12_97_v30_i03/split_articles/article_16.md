Heading home for the holidays? Have you considered traveling by mail? 
First, take a moment to learn the ins and outs of the U.S. Postal Service. 

WHEN I WAS A KID, ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS WAS 
Bruno Takes a Trip. In the story, the somewhat portly 
protagonist Bruno is gripped by a strong desire to 
visit his friends in the country but can't afford a train 
ticket. So, naturally, he sends himself through the mail. He starts by 
cutting holes in the bottom of a big box so that his legs can stick out 
and he can walk to the post office. He stamps "FRAGILE" all over 
the box and packs a blanket, a harmonica,Â· and, of course, a can of 
corn for his pet raven Hans who's going along with him. He ambles 
to the post office, is thrown on the mail train, and after a long trip, he 
finally makes it into the country. When his friends open their 
humongous package, Bruno jumps out and scares them silly. 

Most toddlers would read this book, this voyage of Odyssean 
proportions, and fall asleep contented, dreaming of Bruno and his 
raven Hans making their way through the United States Postal Ser-
vice (USPS). In contrast, the intrepid young scholar would toss and 
turn through the night, raring to cross the country in a washing 
machine box. But of course, this idea is ridiculous, Mom would say 
with a pat on the head. 

Fellow arrogant Yalies, now that we're all grown up, do we have 
to take "No" for an answer? Of course not. Like any other academic 
question we face, the problem of sending oneself bodily through the 
mail merely requires a little study into the intricacies of the USPS. 
After all, we're God's gift to academia-surely we can learn to travel 
through the mail. All we need is a teacher to show us the way. 

Enter Sheldon Rhinehart, New Haven's postmaster and a man 
who has a lot in common with most Yale professors. He even dresses 
the part, in an old-fashioned suit and tie. A thin black man with 
light brown skin and wiry, curly gray hair, he speaks patiently with a 
wisened, gravelly, and slightly squeaky voice. Like the rest of our 
gifted faculty, Rhinehart has also staked out a specialty in his field-
he carries a voluminous knowledge of New Haven's mail. Like most 
over-eager academics, no question on his area of expertise is too 
obscure for Rhinehart. When it comes to mail, he is willing to talk 
about anything, and he won't stop until you understand. 

Guided by Rhinehart, our assignment as students of the USPS 
will be to examine the most minute details of mail processing, to 
step behind the counter at Yale Station, and to carefully investigate 
the caliber of the vehicles that bring us our mail. There's no 
Credit/0/Fail involved; if our studies are not good enough, we will 
surely perish in the final exam, The Mailing of Self. 

Homeroom: Yale Station 
Rhinehart convenes the first class in the early afternoon behind 
the counter at Yale Station. It's very different on the "other side"-
you can see the backs of all the P.O. boxes, and for the first time in 
your life, you can check your mail from the other side of the box. 
(Still empty.) While Rhinehart talks about Yale Station, squeaky 
mailbox doors periodically squeak open and shut as Yalies check 
their mail, creating an odd classroom environment. 


The lecture material for the day is the recent controversy over 
Yale Station. At issue has been mail servi~numerous students 
have complained about hold-ups in receiving letters and packages. 
In a September 22 editorial, the Yak Daily News alleged that staff 
cuts at "the station have hurt performance, and cited mail delays of 
up to a week. "Yale Station has become a model of how not to r:un a 
post office," the Daily argued, holding that service, which is normal-
ly "slow and unreliable," has "deteriorated significantly." As students 
of the USPS, we must thoroughly investigate these charges. 

Here's what the controversy is all about: In 1993, Yale Station 
employed 18 clerks, two mail-handlers, and two supervisors. Today, 
Yale Station employs ten clerks, one mail-handler, and one supervi-
sor. Since the number of full-time employees dropped from 22 to 12 
without a corresponding drop in mail volume, people became con-
cerned. In particular, this fall, students returned to a fairly signifi-
cant mail hold-up. 

However, Rhinehart smoothly replies, as he warms up to his role 
as our postal service mentor, the hold-up, which was only a day or 
two, was temporary and unrelated to staff cutbacks. "The UPS strike 
hit Yale Station at a time that is normally very busy, as students are 
returning to school," he says. "The amount of parcels coming into 
the station quintupled to 25 hampers a day during the fall because 
of the strike." (A hamper is big enough to hold a few dozen pack-
ages.) Rhinehart says the problem is now permanently solved. 

Rhinehart justifies the staff transfers (postal workers are rarely 
fired) with increased automation in the postal service. Today, mail 
comes to Yale pre-sequenced. The clerks at Yale Station simply have 
to walk down the rows of boxes and stuff them. While the amount 
of work is significant, Rhinehart insists that it is manageable. 

Rhinehart ends his lecture with a personal tour of Yale Station, 
to prove his point. He proudly pulls mail out of at least a dozen P.O. 
boxes, carefully examining the timely postmarks before returning the 
letters to their proper place. Contrary to popular belief, an atmos-
phere of neatness and efficiency pervades. Even the president of the 
New Haven Postal Workers' Union, John Dizrius, who would be the 
first to notice the ill-effect_s of staff reductions, is reluctant to make 
any allegations of slow mail at Yale Station. Rhinehart wraps up the 
day by repeating a favorite phrase: "It's very simple. We get the mail 
in, and it goes in the students' boxes the same day." 

Guest Speaker: Postal Clerk 
The next day, the parcel window guy Robert Celone is both lec-
turer and subject as he discusses the ins and outs of being a mail 
clerk. Celone typifies the postal clerks at Yale Station. Casual and 
easygoing, he jokes around a lot. The constant rhythm of his work, 
moving around neat brown parcels and combing through letters, is 
strangely soothing. 

The parcel window guys are the surrogate Santa Clauses to thou-
sands of Yalies. Bringing goodwill to all, the clerks who work at the 
parcel window spread peace and joy throughout the Yale communi-
ty. Celone-slightly portly, wearing big red suspenders and a friend-
ly smile-even looks like Mr. Claus. Admittedly, Celone's delivery 
style is a bit different than St. Nick's; instead of nimbly sliding down 
your chimney, he drops a yellow slip in your P.O. box and you have 
to visit him at the parcel call window. 

He begins his postal lesson slowly in his amiable voice. He han-
dles questions with short responses, intermittently handing students 
their packages. 

"We get a little bit of everything around here," he says. "One 
time, an ex-boyfriend s~nt an ex-girlfriend-how shall I say it-
some bodily fluids. The way we found out is that it started having an 
odor." Despite strange events like this, Celone enjoys Yale Station. 
"Nine out of ten Yale students are really terrific people. I like the 
atmosphere in here. I try to blend in a little humor, kid around with 
them." 

When he's not delivering parcels, Celone indulges his old-fash-
ioned tastes. He listens to classical music and big bands from the 
1940s and is a fan of old black-and-white movies. Lately though, he 
has taken up the Internet on his Web TY. "My teenage nephew 
called me a caveman because I wouldn't buy a computer. They 
must've chipped the ice around the cave," he quips. 

Celone's easy manner reflects the pace and mood of Yale Station. 
December 3, 1997 
The backstage rooms at the post office have a sort of timeless quality 
and, upon exiting the station, the world seems dark and ugly in 
comparison. At any rate, we're ready for the next lesson. On to big-
ger and better things. 

Field Trip: The Mother Ship 
A new day, and we're back with our regular instructor Rhinehart. 
He has scheduled a field trip for today, to New Haven's postal nexus. 
We are about to experience mail delivery on a seriously macro level. 

Just a half-mile from campus, New Haven's main office sprawls 
over 225,000 square feet of floorspace. The main office-more rem-
iniscent of a factory than an office-spews forth an army of delivery 
trucks and Jeeps in the early afternoon, only to accept them into the 
fold once again at night. Inside, the ground floor, which resembles 
an airport tarmac, is too vast for even echoes to carry. Its surface is 
covered with a haphazard array of enormous machines, people 
milling around, and mountain upon mountain of mail. 

Rhinehart suggests a walking tour of the main floor; he pauses 
often to patiently indulge questions. 

How is New Haven's mail delivered? Rhinehart describes the 
complicated process: Mail coming into New Haven starts out in 
Wallingford, Connecticut, where it is sorted and partially sequenced 
by address. After it arrives at the New Haven main office, the mail is 
divided among the different carrier routes. In the early morning, 
each carrier takes the letters for his route back to his cubby area on 
the main floor, and sorts the mail by address. Rhinehart pauses to 
inform me that they do this so early in the morning that workers 
have been known to come to work with their pants on backward, 
not noticing their mistake until morning light. 

Once the mail for each route is sorted, the carrier stuffs his wick-
ets. Each and every address in New Haven has two wickets, or slots, 
for its daily mail: one for regular letters and one for magazines. Each 
carrier route handles about 20 linear feet, or about 5,000 pieces of 
mail each day. "The mail, it comes like snow," declares Rhinehart. 
"We have to keep moving it." Finally, in the early afternoon, the 
mail carriers stream out of the main office to serve Greater New 
Haven's 302 mail routes. It's how we get our mail. 

At this point on our walking tour, Rhinehart takes us near some of 
the heavy machinery. He expounds on the virtues of mail technology 
at length; automation seems to be a favorite 
topic. 

The bulk of the work at the postal ser-
vice is increasingly done by machine. Long 
ago, the postal service used the LSM, or 
Letter Sorting Machine. New Haven still 
has one which is used when mail volume is 
high. About the size of four pregnant ele-
phants stacked on top of one another, the 
awkward machine is operated by 12 people 
who can each sort about 3,600 pieces of 
mail an hour. More recently, the postal ser-
vice started using the CSBCS, or Customer 
Service Bar Code Sorter, which is run by 
one person and can actually read handwrit-
ing. But these machines are mere peanuts 
compared to the DBCS IY, the newly per-
fected fourth generation of the Delivery Bar 
Code Sorter. Operated by two people and 
about the size of a school bus, it can sort and 
sequence 18,000 pieces of mail in one hour. 

Moving past the machines, Rhinehart 
shows me the recently-constructed stamp 
cage, tucked away in a corner of the main 
floor. New Haven is soon to become the 
stamp distribution center for all of Con-
necticut-in other words, every stamp 
licked by every person in every household in 
Connecticut will at one time dwell in the 
New Haven main office. The stamp cage, 
with its sinister black fencing, says "No" to 
potential stamp thieves. One can only try to 
imagine this basketball court-size enclosure 
full of millions of tiny stamps. Rhinehart 
simply smiles with an air of proprietorship 
and walks on. 

Finally, Rhinehart shows me the train-
ing room. On our quick tour, he only shows 
me the outside, which has the capaciry for 
350 postal employees to train simultaneous-
ly. The windows are dark and it's impossible 
to see inside. Rhinehart implies that it is a 
mere auditorium. One can't help but won-
der if it's really a Navy S.EA.L.-style danger 
room with exploding mail boxes and rabid 
dogs, a true training ground for raw postal 
recruits. 

But, fellow disciples of the postal ser-
vice, we don't have time to fully consider the 
possibilities, because Rhinehart IS movmg 
on. To the parking lot. 

Case Study: Vehicles of the USPS 
Rhinehart seems to take his parking lot 
for granted. But the lot of the New Haven 
Postal Service unfolds before the eyes of the 
uninitiated like the centerfold of a smutty 
magazine. To even the most discriminating 
of car aficionados, the lot is a treasure-trove 
of sex-laden, muscular vehicles, painted a 
virile red-white-and-blue. 

T he Postal Service owns a lot of cars. It 
has so many vehicles, in fact, that if the 
price of gas goes up one .cent, their gas bud-
get goes up $1 million. Rhinehart runs 
down the roster of his best delivery trucks. 
There's the LLV (long-light vehicle), 
otherwise known as the three-quarter-ton 
truck. With a top speed of 80 m.p.h. and a 
life expectancy of 25 years, this model is a 
steal at $15,000. Its cargo bed is absolutely 
humongous. Its right side steering is avant-
garde, so chic and English. 

Then there's everyone's favorite, hear-
kening back to Norman Rockwell, the post 
office Jeep. Weighing in at a mere quarter-
ton, it is now being retired from the USPS 
after a long career of distinguished service. 
This previously unattainable gem can now 
be bought used for around $750. True, its 
somewhat boxy design makes it less than 
desirable for a night on the town, but think: 
utility, utility, utility. 

Finally, the penultimate and most recent 
addition to the post office family: the mini-
van. With its broad, wire-cage cargo bed full 
of jostling parcels, it makes other cars seem 
barren and impotent as it passes them on 
the road. Too elite for regular dury, the V6 
special-converted postal minivan is used 
exclusively for express deliveries. Stylewise, 
the minivan's suburban lineage makes it an 
adequate cousin to the post office Jeep, but 
its sleek body allows for a racy sexiness that 
bursts its conservative bounds. Rhinehart 
insists that the top speed of the post office 
minivan is only 85 m.p.h. But one glance, 
and any postal student with a critical mind 
knows it's good for 100 m.p.h., if not more. 

Attempts to take a spin in one of the 
vehicles ("C'mon, you can pull some strings, 
right?") are met with Rhinehart's firm but 
gentle admonishment. Alas, no go. Insur-
ance and all that. 

Final Exam: The Mailing of Self 
The culmination of our studies, is of 
course, sending oneself through the mail, 
what the top scholars in the field like to 
call the Bruno hypothesis. Is it possible? 
With bated breath, the question js put to 
Rhinehart. 

He laughs. "No. We don't take parcels 
over 70 pounds." 

Drat. 

This is where the average pos~al student 
loses heart and the aspiring postal profes-
sional shifts into serious extra-credit. So I 
scrjke out and dare to color outside the 
lines. It's time to try another carrier service. 
I bid farewell to Rhinehart's familiar USPS; 
at some point, I realize with a heavy heart, 
one must move beyond the comforting 
arms of his teachers and into the wider 
world. 

First, I'll need a box. I call Pack-Rite, 
Inc., and ask them how much it would cost 
to build a 5-foot wooden cube box with 
screened air-holes. The guy there, Oleg, 
informs me that it would cost $270 and 
would weigh 260 pounds and use 160 
square feet of plywood. Too heavy. 

What I figure then is, how about rrav-
elling inside of an aluminum canoe? They 
only weigh about 50 pounds and there's 
plenty of room to lie down. I start calling 
delivery places with the .premise of send-
ing a 200-pound package through the 
mail, from New Haven to Minnesota, my 
home state. 

Amtrak says they'll do it for $50. My 
heart leaps. But then they find out the 
dimensions of the box. They don't take 
parcels over three feet in length. Unless one 
feels like traveling in a 3 foot by 3 foot by 3 
foot box (i.e., in the fetal position) for more 
than a day, this is probably not the way to go. 

Next is Atlantic Customs. They're pret-
ry sharp and just hang up on me.
