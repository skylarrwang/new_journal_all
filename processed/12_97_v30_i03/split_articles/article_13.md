nature of the ·police department's graffiti 
team. Polio doesn't know the names of the 
kids he is looking for; all he has to go on are 
the tags. His methods are not altogether 
orthodox. He promises meals, combs the 
papers for the identity of the taggers, and even 
does a little bombing of his own. 

"You know how we found out who OMS 
was?" Polio asks, handing me a clipping from 
the New Haven Register. I stare at the picture 
of a band from Wallingford with a long-
haired lead singer, and look back at Polio con-
fused. "That band is OMS. I was just looking 
through the paper, and there they were." 

Indeed, a look at the photo's caption gives the 
kids away: "OMS, a Wallingford-based rock 
band, returned from a European tour to their 
hometown. When asked what their name 
stands for their answer varies between Drastic 
Mood Swing and Don't Mean @#?!." 

"So this is OMS?" I ask,. "But they're just a 
band." Visions of inner-city gangsters waging 
turf wars are dispelled by the picture of angst-
:ij ridden suburban teenagers. "Most of these 
~ kids aren't from New Haven," Polio says. 
£ "They come from families where the average 
"lij household income is $100,000 a year." Polio 
~ swivels around in his chair and turns on the 
:l; computer behind him. This is his database. 
~ With a few clicks of the keyboard a listing 
~ comes up of the towns most of the apprehend-
ed graffiti taggers come from: Milford, Bran-
ford, Guilford. New Haven's graffiti is largely 
the hobby of suburban boys. Few of the artists 
are female, few are minorities, and few are 
poor. They hang outside the Daily Ca.ffe and 
the Tune Inn and pale when Polio threatens to 
call their parents. "These are vandals, but most 
of them have never committed any felonies. 
You don't get many gang tags in the downtown 
area, that stuff is a little farther away." 

"The stuff on the streets isn't terribly cre-
ative," Polio says. A few more clicks on his key-
~ 
board and another list appears on the screen. 
This rime it's alphabetical and mostly initials. 
"Tills is a list of all the tags we find in the 
municipal area. Look at this one. Who do you 
think this guy is?" he asks, pointing to HEC 
DOE. I am puzzled. 

"C'mon, say it quickly," Polio urges. 

"Hecdoe ... Hectoe ... Hector?" I say. 

"That's right, Hector. HEC DOE is Hec-
tor. AU you have to do is be able to read it. 
Like I said, some of this stuff isn't too cre-
ative."·A tagger who calls himselfRahmique's 
Boy puts his address and his girlfriend's name 
on his graffiti. "It's not hard to track them 
down when they do stuff like that," Polio says. 

Then there are the crew tags like HBO. 
Not the cable channel, but rather Hill Boys 
Only. What does ECB mean? Elm City Boys. 
"The only qualification you need to be an 
Elm City Boy is to be from New Haven. 
They're a gang that was formed in j~ but 
they're pretty harmless. Actually, one of the 
guys is meeting me here later." 

Polio scrolls down the list on the comput-
er screen. TO BY. The lieutenant gives me 
some background. "He's an enforcer for a 
gang, but he's dumber than a sto,ne-some-
one else must be writing his name for him 
because he's in jail more than he's out." 

According to Polio, most of the taggers are 
just young people looking to identify them-
selves. "We get worried when we see tags that 
have been written over. If you write on peo-
ple's tags, you get shot at, so we try to cover 
that up as soon as it comes out." 

But the caggers aren't the only ones bomb-
ing. "Sure, we bomb the gangs. There was a 
building downtown that they were trespassing 
in. We went in and saw their tags and 
bombed them. We wrote right over it: 
NHPD. Yeah, we left a message: for them-
that they better not come back 'cause we'll be 
back everyday." 

"In one neighborhood the folks were 
complaining about this house," Polio says. 
"Shoes were hanging over the telephone wire 
outside which means drugs were being sold 
there. We went in and bombed the place With 
'Gangs Don't Fit In This Neighborhood-
NHPD.' Son of a gun, their graffiti was down 
and the place cleaned up." But, offbeat stories 
like these are rare in the war against raggers. 
Most of the kids get caught or are turned in. 
Polio explains his policing methods. "They 
keep notebooks, so when we catch them, what 
do we do? We take their notebooks." From 
underneath his desk, Polio pulls out a large 
brown box. In it, there are thick envelopes 
filled with photocopied versions of the graffiti 
artists' portfolios. "We keep this scuff on file so 
when we see a new tag, we can match the let-
tering and identify who did it," Polio says. "We 
tell the kids you need to fix your stuff. They 
have to wash it off or paint it with the same 
color of paint within ten days and then they 
won't be arrested. We make a deal." Polio 
shows me an example of one of the contracts 
he offers to offenders who are caught. 

But while the police confiscate paint and 
notebooks and require raggers to sign these 
pacts, the artists are -rarely deterred. Take for 
example, New Haven's YACone. Even though 
he was recently caught by Polio, his attitude 
remains unchanged. He wouldn't be inter-

viewed in person, but he gave me a written 
statement. "I am a writer, and I was appre-
hended by the New Haven Police. I love graf-
fiti. I love it for its challenge, its power. It is 
beautiful; it is more dynamic, provocative, 
and interesting than any other two-dimen-
sional art form in my opinion. Cavemen did 
it, so did Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians. As 
writers, we are not alone in our desire for 
fame. The very goal of humankind, it often 
seems, is to be remembered, to live forever in 
a sense. There's graffiti on the moon." 

G
raffiti on the moon? In this culture of 
tagging and bombing and posting 
and NHPD and HBO and ERA, the 
ultimate question becomes what is graffiti? 
I'm told the crown I saw on Brian Rorick's 
memorial mural is merely an imitation of the 
symbol used by the gang Latin Kings. Accord-
ing to Polio the kids who use it in New Haven 
are simply artistic kids trying to lend their 
work an air of authenticity. "You see the num-
bers 231 around town. That's the police code 
for homicide in New York. You see it up by 
the legal wall, but it's harmless." 

"Most of these kids are j~t seeking atten-
tion," Polio concludes. "See Verse, he's blatant 
and malicious. He got up there on the second 
story of the Chapel Square Mall and hung 
upside down to do that tag just so people 
waiting on line at the Tune Inn could look up 
and say 'Wow, cool, look at that.' Right now 
he's the one we're looking for." 

Depending on who you are, you call graf-
fiti art or vandalism. There are the gang mem-
bers, there are the wannabe gang members, 
and there are those who are just in it for the 
thrill like Verse. There are the supporters of 
graffiti artists like Mike Reichbart and AI 
Greenberg, and there are the people who have 
to clean up after them like Joe Polio. 

In the end there is only one certainty. 
With all of the new construction around 
town, the fresh concrete walls are a graffiti 
artist's dream come true. Whether the prod-
UCts of this dream are an eyesore or an asset is 
a matter of opinion. But for now, it is Verse 
who has the last word. I saw it in big black let-
ters, painted on the top of the new Yale Book-
store: "1 AM EVERYWHERE.".
