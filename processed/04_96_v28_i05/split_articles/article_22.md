peaceful relations between northern and 
southern students. Many of those attracted 
to Yale by Calhoun's influence formed the 
Calliopean Society, a by-product of the 
slowly dissolving Union. 

John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, 
the valedictorian of his class, was the most 
influential American politician to graduate 
from Yale during its first two centuries. 
During his long tenure in U.S. politics, he 
held the positions of Congressman, 
Secretary of War, Vice President, Secretary 
of State, and Senator. Calhoun's numerous 
letters to Yale faculty and alumni reflect 
his sense of connection to Yale. New 
Haven, a bastion路 of Federalist support for 
a strong central government in the Early 
Republic, solidified Calhoun's anti-
federalist, states' rights commitments. 

The pro-southern sentiments of 
Calhoun and the Calliopean Society, 
however, represent only one perspective of 
antebellum southerners at Yale. One man 
in particular, Cassius M. Clay of Kentucky 
(B.A. 1832), stood in stark contrast with 
many of his fellow southern students. Clay 
complicates many preconceived notions 
about the homogeneity of the antebellum 
South and about the southern experience 
at Yale. Rather than reacting negatively to 
the opposing viewpoints of his new 
environment, he embraced them and 
returned to the South with a new vision. 

Even though he was the son of a 
slaveholder, Clay became one of the 
South's leading abolitionists after hearing 
the fiery rhetoric of the abolitionist 
champion William Lloyd Garrison in New 
Haven. During the Civil War, Clay 
intermittently served as a major-general of 
the Union Army and as Minister to 
Russia. 

In the ten years leading up to the Civil 
War, the campus and the city saw the 
warning signs of the coming violence. In 
1853, the Calliopean Society dissolved, 
and many southerners returned to the 
South. When the society disbanded, the 
center of southern social and intellectual 
life collapsed and southern enrollment 
plummeted. In 1850, 72 southerners were 
enrolled at Yale, 65 at Harvard, and 115 at 
Princeton. By 1860, only 33 remained at 
Yale while Harvard and Princeton 
remained stable with 63 and 113 
respectively. The dramatic increases in the 
numbers of southerners at H?-rvard and 
Princeton can be attributed, in part, to 
those universities' shifts away from a local 
perspective to a national one by mid-
century. For the southern students who 
remained, the sectional instability only 
increased. 

Sunday morning, January 20, 1861, 
the national secession crisis rocked 
the Yale campus when students and 
professors awoke to find a secession flag 
flying above Alumni Hall on the Old 
Campus. During the night, Southern 
students had broken into the building and 
raised the flag up the flagpole. It had a 
large white background with a red cross in 
the center that spanned the flag's length 
and width. Depicted in the upper left-
hand corner was the crescent moon and 
palmetto tree associated with the state of 
South Carolina. Northern students 
stormed the building, but they found the 
locks plugged with nails and the 
doorknobs removed. After failing to break 
open the doors, they found a back 
entrance, which they used to climb to the 
roof. Once on the roof, they tore down the 
flag and took back Alumni Hall. This 
event made national headlines when the 
following issue of Harper's Weekly reported 
the confrontation and illustrated the chaos 
with three on-the-scene sketches. Unlike 
the majority of Ivy League schools during 
the secession crises, Yale did not expel its 
southern students at the outbreak of the 
war, though the war itself would draw 
many men back home. 

The Civil War began in 1861 and 
would not loosen its grip until 600,00Q 
Americans-166 Yale men-were dead路. 
The issues fueling the backroom squabbles 
of a student organization were brought out 
into the open and decided on the 
battlefield. Of those killed, 55 were 
Confederate, 48 from Yale College, and 
seven from the Yale Law School. The 
casualty rates for Union and Confederate 
Yale students were vastly different: 69 
percent of Confederates, while only 13 
percent of the Union alumni, were killed. 

In路 1915, the names of both Union and 
Confederate dead were carved in the 
freshly cut marble of the Woolsey 
Rotunda. Yale students' important 
contribution to the Confederacy, however, 
came not on the battlefield but within the 
government. 

The Confederacy's Attorney General 
Judah P. Benjamin (B.A. 1828) was later 
appointed Secretary of War. Benjamin was 
the highest-ranking Yale man on either 
side of the conflict. He had been expelled 
before graduating for reasons still 
contested today. The official records say 
that he was expelled for "cheating," but 
there is no further elaboration on the 
charge. He was at the top of his class and 
there are no signs that he cheated on his 
academic work. It has been assumed that 
he was cheating at cards or engaged in 
some other form of gambling on campus. 

Yale men also held power within the

private sphere of the Confederacy. Burton 
N. Harrison (B.A. 1845) was Jefferson 
Davis's private secretary; Richard Taylor 
(B.A. 1845) was Davis's son-in-law and 
President Zachary Taylor's son. 

It would be easy to conclude that the 
return of southern alumni to Yale and 
the voyages of new southern students 
would be strained by the events of the 
early 1860s, but the divisions did not 
settle as deeply as in many of the other Ivy 
League schools. Boston, where Harvard is 
located, was the seat of abolition. Brown 
had expelled its southern students during 
the war. Yale was thus left in a better 
position to restore post-war ties with the 
South. Only Princeton fared better, with 
its Presbyterian tradition and long-
standing complacence toward slavery. 

Alumni from the South rerurned to Yale as 
early as 1866, and by the 1870s, ivy from 
Robert E. Lee's house was planted on the 
Old Campus during Commencement to 
symbolize the reconciliation of the 
Confederacy with the rest of the nation. 

With the arrival of the twentieth century, 
the South would help transform Yale into 
a great research university. 

though the country was reunified 
and moving toward international 
prominence, the North and South 
were developing in different ways. Jim 
Crow thrived in the South, and the 
Robber Barons began to dominate the 
national economy. The aristocracy, which 
had sent its sons to Yale, saw a new 
capitalist, urban culture emerge. New 
money from northern industrialists such 
as the Vanderbilts, Sterlings, and 
Harknesses 
supported 
the 
rapid 
construction of the residential colleges, 
library, and graduate school. Social life 
began to revolve around secret societies, 
eating clubs, and the other groups formed 
from the ranks of New England's 
prestigious and elite boarding schools. 

Southerners entered a social order 
dominated by this group and felt it 
necessary to form their own brotherhood. 
The Southern Club first appeared in 
the Yale Banner in 1895. Between 1895 
and 1905, their logo portrayed 
persistent racial stereotypes, 
depicting alcohol, guns, and 
women. One of the early 
club logos depicted two 
Sambo-like black men 
chasing a chicken 
down the street. 

These logos suggest 
a 
reliance 
on 
entrenched 
stereotypes 
and 
icons of southern 
life in the face of a 
new and unfamiliar 
social 
elite. 

The 
Southern Club had 
chapters on the majority 
of the Ivy League campuses. 
An April 1898 article in the 
Atlanta journal reported the annual 
meeting of the Southern Clubs that was 
held at Harvard that year. The members 
ate, drank, sang "Dixie," and discussed the 
contributions of southerners in the Ivy 
League. 

The Southern Renaissance in 
literature and the emergence of 
southern universities, in the first 
decades of the twentieth century, created a 
new generation of southern intellectuals 
and writers who gained national attention. 
Yale's urban New 
England setting gave 
many southerners the 
opportunity to begin the 
process of understanding 
the South. 

As these路changes occurred in the South, 
Yale was expanding and opening its doors 
to a larger portion of the American 
population. New professors without Yale 
degrees and students without New 
England pedigrees began to arrive in New 
Haven. 

One of the best-known figures of the 
Southern Renaissance, William Faulkner, 
carne to New Haven in April 1918. Living 
an apartment at 120 York 
Street, Faulkner worked in 
the Winchester Arms 
Factory while visiting 
his friend Phil Stone 
(B.A. '14, LAW '18). 

Faulkner's letters 
from New Haven 
to his parents in 
Mississippi offer a 
glimpse into the 
life 
of 
southerner living 
at Yale in the 
beginning of the 
twentieth century. 

He was intrigued by 
the lack of African-
Americans in New Haven 
and the surprisingly large 
number of southerners living in 
the city itself. The popular obsession with 
the clock and the other trappings of 
industrialization, such as trolleys, trains, 
and large factories, were both fascinating 
and annoying to Faulkner. He found the 
people friendly and interesting, although 
excessively preoccupied with status and 
tradition. Many literary critics argue that 
Faulkner's Quentin Compson of Absalom, 
Absalom! and The Sound and the Fury are 
based on the author's observations of Yale 
and New Haven. In 1942, Yale became the

first university to exhibit Faulkner's 
writings, since much of his work was out 
of print. 

The social and academic scene became 
more integrated as the residential college 
system replaced the eating clubs and other 
elite groups, with the exception of the 
secret societies. The emphasis on research 
brought new professors from the South in 
the 1930s. The faculty of the history an~ 
English departments benefited greatly 
from this infusion of southerners. Among 
the new names were Ulrich Bonnell 
Phillips, a historian of the Old South; 
David M. Potter (GRD '36), a student of 
Phillips and a historian of America and 
the South; Mary Wright, a historian of 
China and the first woman to be tenured 
at Yale; Cleanth Brooks, a literary critic; 
Robert Penn Warren (M.A. '28), an 
author and poet. Phillips and Potter were 
influential in shaping the discipline of 
American history, while Brooks and 
Warren, through their founding of a 
school of literary criticism known as New 
Criticism, reshaped the way students read 
literature. The presence of these 
luminaries attracted more southern minds, 
such 
as one of America's 
most 
distinguished historians, Sterling Emeritus 
Professor C. Vann Woodward, who 
replaced Potter in 1961. 

The more democratic Yale also 
opened its doors to a group of 
southerners that were merging into 
the American mainstream: African-
Americans. In the late 1960s and early 
1970s, African-Americans were admitted 
in sizable numbers for the first time. 
During these first few years, John 
Blassingame (GRD '71) and Henry Louis 
Gates, Jr. (CC '73) came to Yale as
