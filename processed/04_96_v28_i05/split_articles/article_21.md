Yale's Southern Accent 
From April 9 to September l, the lobby of Sterling Memorial 
Library will display the exhibit, "Elms and Magnolias: Old Blue in a 
Coat of Gray," curated by junior Garry L. Reeder II. The photos, 
artwork, and literature in the exhibit were collected by Reeder over 
two years of independent research. Reeder discusses the ties between 
Yale and the South in this article, a companion to the exhibit.

ne evening on the Old Campus in 1819, over 100 
years before the gothic imports arrived and when the 
brick row still stood strong, a secession crisis held 
hostage one of Yale's rwo literary societies. On the rop 
floor of the Georgian-Colonial brick Lyceum, the university's 
chapel and library on the Old Campus, a face-off began within 
the Linonia Society. 
Two candidates, one northern, one southern, were being 
considered for president of the society. The northern candidate 
emerged victorious, and a southern party of 32 students within 
the Linonia Society walked out and formed the Calliopean 
Society. Whether the walkout was sectional or personal in origin 
remains unclear, but the Calliopean became the society of choice 
for southerners until its dissolution in 1853. Without the 
residential college system, the dormitories on the Old Campus, or 
the Political Union, these literary societies formed the major 
avenues of social and intellectual interaction. Only those who 
belonged to a society could use its books and attend its meetings 
and debates. In the same year that the Calliopean was formed, the 
national debate over the admission of Missouri into the Union as 
either a free or slave state was on the minds of most Americans. 
The formation of the Calliopean Society foreshadowed the course 
that history was to take 40 years later. 
The national dilemma of sectionalism which cook hold of the 
Qj 
Yale campus and eventually killed its sons can be traced to rwo of § 
Yale's most pro.minent students, Eli Whitney (B.A. 1792) and ~ 
John C. Calhoun (B.A. 1804). Whitney, a resident of New 
~ 
.. 
Haven, played an unexpected, yet pivotal role in the advent of the ~ 
Civil War. The summer after his graduation Whitney went into 
the South to visit the widow of General Nathaniel Greene, a hero 
: 
of the American Revolution. There he invented the cotton gin. ;; 
His invention corona ted "King Cotton," transformed the ~ 
southern economy, and in turn changed the nature of American 
.<: 
slavery. The cotton gin made the production of cotton quick and "-
profitable throughout the South by increasing the production 
potential and value of slaves. After returning to New Haven and 
Garry L. Reeder II 
failing to secure a patent for his cotton gin, Whitney was awarded 
a contract from the federal government for 10,000 guns. To fill 
this order, he opened a gun factory, the Whitney Armory in New 
Haven, and introduced interchangeable parts. This marked the 
beginning of the Industrial Revolution in America, forever 
changing the northern economy. Ironically, the guns that were 
produced at Whitney's New Haven gun factory would later be 
used in a war over slavery. 
M
any of the South's most prominent sons came to Yale in 
the first half of the nineteenth century out of their cult-
like adoration for John C. Calhoun. In 1830, 69 
southerners were enrolled at Yale, compared to 17 at Princeton 
and 16 at Harvard. However, this preference for Yale among the 
Ivy League schools should not be misinterpreted as evidence of
