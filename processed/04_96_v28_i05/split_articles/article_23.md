students. Blassingame, a history professor 
at Yale, and Gates, the W. E. B. Dubois 
Professor of Humanities and Chairman of 
the African-American studies department 
at Harvard, are now two of the 
preeminent scholars of African-American 
life, past and present. Both came from the 
rural South to New Haven and Yale 
during the last years of the Civil Rights 
movement, the Bobby Seale trial, and the 
Black Panthers. The incong.ruity of a rural 
southern African-American at a wealthy, 
elite university in an urban setting created 
unique tensions and new ways of 
understanding the South and the 
relationship of African-Americans to the 
South. 

Professor Edward Ayers (GRD. '80), 
Kenan Professor of History at the 
University of Virginia, said, "Yale, in 
short, made me see the South through eyes 
other than my own. In a very real sense, it 
gave me the South." Now one of the 
foremost scholars of the American South, 
Ayers came to Yale with no overwhelming 
interest in the region of his birth but left 
with a new vision. 

Yale's 
urban 
New 
England 
environment gave many southerners the 
opportunity to begin the process of 
understanding the South. They defined 
the South for themselves but also for the 
others around them. Exploring the lives of 
nearly three centuries of southern Yalies, 
the stereotypes of both the South and New 
England dissolve. In their place, new ways 
of seeing emerge attesting to the many 
Souths that exist within the past and the 
present.
