#Suicide 
It looks like a telephone hotline 
offering free counseling for a "family 
member who has exhibited the warning 
signs." Instead it is a "chatroom" on the 
Internet, a gathering place for those who 
have tried to kill themselves, those with 
suicidal friends, those who are considering 
the "big move," and those who simply wish 
to watch in silence. On a typical Saturday 
night, there may be more 
than 35 visitors at a time, 
each sending one-or two-
line messages into the 
chatroom. The effect is 
that of a continuously 
scrolling conversation in 
which three or four 
different topics are dis-
cussed simultaneously. 
It's 
1 
a.m. 
and 
"Kalton" and "Dedalus" 
are in the middle of what 
would prove to be a two-
hour conversation, just as 
"Courtnee" welcomes "Doodle," a 
relative newcomer to the group. 
<Dedalus> Kolton, have you ever tried 
counseling? 
<Courtnee> So, Doodle, how was your 
day? 
<Kolton> fuck counseling! those pointy-
headed pricks don't know what I'm 
going through! in their fancy cars 
and nice suits ... fuck them! 
<Doodle> You know. I got up and tried 
to find something that would make 
it worthwhile. 
<Dedalus> Kolton: dude, you can 
probably get it free from yr 
Student Health Center. No big 
cars/suits. 
<Courtnee> Did you find it? 
<Dedalus> Kalt: it's not as fucked up 
as it sounds, trust me. 
<Doodle> I'm still here aren't I? 
<Kolton> I can't stand it. none of you 
care about me! none of you know me!

<Kolton> I thought coming here might 
help ... but it only confirmed my 
suspicions. 
<Dedalus> You gotta give us a reason to 
care. What, we're supposed to give 
a damn? 
Courtnee is a pillar of the group in 
these after- hours. One can easily imagine 
her, a maternal figure, logging in at the end 
of an empty day to a world which is far 
'llore intimate and 
simple than her 
own. She says 
that she "has 
tried to do it a 
few times, but 
now I an:t okay." 
When 
she 
occasionally 
.leaves 
comes back, a 
welcoming 
chorus of "Nee!" 
fills a page of text. 
Â·has the power to 
moderate the discussion, to 
change the current subject, and to eject 
people from the chatroom for whatever 
reason she wants. 

It is impossible to tell exactly who is 
suicidal and who is preying on the 
vulnerable. One young man, "St-of-C," 
claimed in short order to be gay, a 
three-time failure at suicide, on 
amphetamines, getting over a "serious 
fling," and in the ninth grade. He may 
have been serious, but even through the 
flattening effect of a silent discussion, one 
could hear a mocking tone in his voice. 
Perhaps it was the anonymity of the 
chat group which allowed me to join in 
that night. No names, no faces, no 
consequences. It offered a chance to 
dispense with the niceties and subtleties of 
conversation, to be free from the shackles 
of both taboo and appearance. 
<anon> I had a friend. His twelve-year-
old sister found him in the garage. 
He killed himself with a 12-gauge 
shotgun through the roof of his 
head. I had talked to him only a 
week before. 
<Courtnee> Anon, you couldn't have 
known. You couldn't have done 
anything. Don't blame yourself. 
<anon>..J: don't exactly. But ... I wrote 
his parents a sympathy card. His 
mom wrote back. She told me to 
visit in the coming summer. I never 
did. I was afraid that she would 
ask me about him, about our 
friendship, about why I thought he 
did it. I'm afraid of going to that 
house. It's like an accusation- why 
didn't you help me? Why didn't you 
pay attention? I don't know. I just 
think about him sometimes ... in the 
ground you know ... and I can just 
see his face, the way he was. But 
then he is gone. 

At 2 a.m., we talk about the relative 
effectiveness of slitting one's wrists {parallel 
to the arm is best), cyanide (clean, 
effective, hard to get}, sleeping pills (Nee 
tried twice with them), carbon monoxide 
("Gopi" said that it made him cough before 
he passed out), and, of course, guns 
{hollow-tipped bullets are recommended 
for the quickest way out). Some seem eager 
to die, others frightened, but they all want 
to find the quickest and least painful way 
to go. 
<Kolton> any of you know a good place 
to buy a gun? 
<Gopi> I tried but I was too young. 
Next time I'm gonna borrow my 
brother's ID. 
<Kolton> sleeping pills are a lot 
easier to get. 
<Gopi> Yeah ... but I've seen like a 
million people try it on TV, and 
none of them ever dies. 

At 5 a.m. or so, as the sun peaks over 
the horizon, the group disperses to catch a 
few hours of sleep. My monitor stills as the
