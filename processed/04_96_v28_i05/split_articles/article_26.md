**Title: What I Learned from the Strike of '96**

Look around Yale and you'll see lots of aloof humanities 
majors and Science Hill geeks walking around with their 
heads in the clouds. Without any useful skills, dependent 
on others to feed and clean up after them, Yalies are 
frightening examples of human frailty and weakness. In response 
to this epidemic of fragility, the administration has taken action. 
Determined that every undergrad take a term in the Sterling 
School of Hard Knocks (SSHK), Yale has provoked a work 
stoppage so that it might send its students out to walk the 
pavement of the mean streets of New Haven. Who says Yale isn't 
responsive to student needs? 


The administration's message to students is clear: "Return to 
your roots as a hunter and a gatherer. Learn to fend for yourself in 
this harsh, cruel world. Clean the hair out of your shower drain 
yourself." Like any proud parent sending its children to the first 
day of school, Yale watches as students walk through the shiny 
new electronic gates of the colleges, off to SSHK with nothing 
but a pat on the back and a $105 allowance. The lessons aren't 
easy, but hey, neither is life. Yale never promised you a rose 
garden, pal, so put down that book, and get busy learning 
something useful. 


1) Louis' Lunch isn't open for dinner on weeknights. 
If you bring three of your best friends across campus from TD 
in the pouring rain, promising them the best burgers in the 
world, you're going to lose those friends when you find a big 
padlock on the door. Those ex-friends may even throw soggy 
onion rings at you when you end up in Burger King. 


2) Business is up at Cutler's and Quality Wine Shop. 
Give Yale students $105, and they'll buy liquor and CDs. 
What a shocker. 


3) Business is down at Commons. 
·Give Yale students $105, and they won't buy cod nuggets and 
soylada tacos. What a shocker. 


4) What do they want? A contract. When do they want it? First thing 
in the morning. 


In a brilliant tactical move, the union has decided that a 
surefire way to win student support is to wake up everybody 
around Berkeley and Calhoun at 6 a.m. by shouting questions at 
the top of their lungs. · 


5) The most important issue of this strike is the security firm hired by 
Yale. 


At least that's how it seems based on the expensive glossy 
magazine that the unions placed in every undergraduate mailbox. 
Apparently subcontracting and casual labor just aren't important 
enough to be turned into slick propaganda. 


6) Henry Kissinger is part of a secret university conspiracy: 
His "surprise" arrival on April 8 allowed President Levin to 
duck out of his meeting with the Student Labor Action Coalition 
(SLAC). In truth, Tricky Dick Levin, uncertain of how to handle 
the hippies congregating in Woodbridge Hall, went to the 
BatPhone and called in Kissinger. The union is raising money 
right now to produce a glossy booklet detailing this conspiracy. 


7) Mother Nature is a union member. 
The April 10 snow storm was a brilliant ma!leuver, forcing 
students to slog through early morning slush that usually would 
have been cleared away by Local 35 workers. The blizzard 
scheduled for Commencement is the unions' ace-in-the-hole;
