EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
arly on the morning of December 19, the students of 
Langdon Hammer's Contemporary American Literature 
class took their places in a crowded Linsly-Chittenden 
lecture hall. With only a few minutes remaining before the 
final exam, students flipped nervously through a semester's worth of 
notes. They double-checked their backup ballpoints and folded back 
the covers of their blue books. 
But some of these students thought they had nothing to worry 
about. They expected the exam co be a piece of cake. They believed 
they had seen the questions beforehand. 

Several days prior to the final, some students had obtained what 
they thought was a copy of the exam. They called friends. The 
information spread. Some students even gathered to memorize the 
questions. Students speculated about the source of the informacion 
but were hesitant to reveal where or with whom it originated. A 
persistent rumor suggested that a TA's review session was the source, 
which implied that the information was legitimate. 

In the context of the Graduate Employees and Students 
Organization's (GESO) impending grade strike, anxiety was at a 
fever pitch within the Yale community. Undergraduates, in 
particular, worried that the strike would result in an arbitrary 
assignment of grades if professors attempted to hastily give marks 
during the TAs' absence. Out of the intensifying hysteria 
surrounding the grade strike, the issue of cheating surfaced. The 
blurriness of exactly what constituted "cheating" became an issue for 
closer scrutiny. 

Students in Hammer's course only really began to wrestle with 
the possibility that they had cheated once the exam was over. One 
student left two anonymous messages for Professor Hammer (BK 
'80). Another wrote a short letter to him expressing conce_rn about 
the notes he had obtained from a review session. After seeing the 
exam, he worried that the notes had provided him with more 
information than he should have had. In response to the student's 
letter, Hammer (BK '80), an associate professor of English, 
approached the teaching fellow in question. He was satisfied that 
what had transpired was nothing more than a thorough review 
session. "I would be vety concerned about it if students felt there 
was something wrong before the exam and did not come forward to 
myself or to the teaching fellow," says Hammer. "It's one thing if a 
teaching fellow says some things in a review session, and it's more 
than should be said. It's another thing for students to walk away 
from a review session feeling that they are in possession of the exam 
and feeling guilty and secretive. If that were the case, I would want 
to know about it immediately." 

In order to address cheating, one needs to be able to identify it. 
Yale seems to have a problem doing that. About half of the cases that 
come before the Executive Committee are related to cheating and 
plagiarism. Rogers Smith (Hon. MA '90), the current Ex Comm 
Chair and professor of political science, believes, "It is clear that it is 
a recurring and not too unusual phenomenon at Yale." But a 
complicating factor lies in the difficulty in assigning blame: is it the 
students' fault? theTAs'? the professors'? To localize blame overlooks 


young man smiled sheepishly. There was a measure of 
in his voice as he talked about his fraternity. They have 
plans in the upcoming year. They intend to conduct a 
fundraising events in support of local charities. They hope to 
buy a new house. But more significantly, they have created a new 
position within the organization: Director of Scholarship. His smile 
widened, became more sheepish. The Director of Scholarship, he 
said, will be in charge of organizing the "academic files" housed in -
the fraternity, which currently stand in a state of disarray. The three 
scrambled-up file cabinets that represent the contributioqs of past 
and present members-the midterms, problem sets, and labs of 
years past-will be assembled methodicaJiy for easy access by 
fraternity brothers and their friends. 

Yale does not have a clear policy on this time-honored tradition's 
legality. Smith says, "It depends 
whether the professor has 
indicated that previous exams 
could not be used. A student is 
culpable if the professor asked 
the student not to. Many 
professors don't do that, in 
which case I think it's perfectly 
fine if students look at previous 
exams." This places students 
who cannot get their hands on 
old material at a distinct 
disadvantage. 

"Yale should draw the line 
in the dirt. It should declare old 
1 exams, problem sets, and papers 
taboo," says Matt Prout (PC 
'96) vehemently. As a Molecular 
Biophysics and Biochemistry 
(MB&B) major, he has taken 
his fair share of Group IV 
courses and has been frustrated 
time and again by the 
ambiguity of Yale's policy on recrtied information. He is fed up with 
a system that rewards students who have access to tests. Talking it 
over with other students-a personal project of his-has provided a 
forum for thinking through possible solutions. 

Alex Krulic (PC '96), a student representative on the Ex Comm, 
has joined Prout in this discussion. He believes that Yale should 
establish a black and white policy regarding the use of old material. 
"Old exams should either be part of the public record or their use 
should be prohibited entirely." What the rwo agree on is that there 
must be some clarification of policy. The ethics governing the use of 
information cannot remain as they are, half-obscured and little 
considered. 

approach assumes that professors will monitor the use of 
material. Certain professors, for instance, place old exams 
reserve in libraries to be used as study guides. Students 
have equal access to the material. This eliminates fear of an 
unfair curv(:). For this system to function properly, the professor 
must change the questions on labs and exams each semester. This 
does not always happen. It is a well-known fact to undergraduates
