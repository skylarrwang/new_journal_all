defaulted loans rather chan prevent 
students from defaulting in the first place. 


Since the federal 
government 
guarantees student loans, Bob 
Shireman, legislative director for 
Senator Paul Simon (D-Ill.), argued that 
no one in the student loan system has any 
incentive to prevent defaults. "No one 
other than the government risks anything 
if students massively default," Shireman 
explained. Everyone, from the banks to 
the guaranties, will get 
paid no 
w 
h a 
t 
Shireman 
noted, 
"The. bank doesn't care if they do a good 
job collecting. The guaranty agency is 
supposed co enforce that." 

Even though the guaranties are non-
profit companies, executives within these 
groups have proven adept at cashing in on 
the non-profit student loan business for 
big pay-offs. Stories of steep salaries and 
extravagant perks for executives at student 
loan 
guaranties 
abound 
among 
Congressional supporters of student loan 
reform. According to Rep. Petri, one 
guaranty CEO is reported co make over 
$700,000-quice a lavish salary for the 
head of a non-profit organization. At the 
same guaranty, the Representative noted 
that 15 other employees receive higher 
salaries than the Secretary of Education. 

One common trick-of-the-trade fo r 
executives at guaranty agencies is to set 
up businesses that only serve the guaranty 
and then collect che profits off the 
businesses. For example, one guaranty's 
executives sec up a telecommunications 
business and then leased phones from it 
for $81,720 a year. 

Like banks, guaranties fear the 
reforms of the Direct Loan Program and 
have been lobbying against it in Congress. 
Shireman explained that under 
the Direct Loan Program, 
"There would be 
no such thing 
as 
guaranty 
agenctes stnce 
no 
bank 
would 
be 
involved tn 
the loan." 

Finally 
seeing where my 
$54 had gone-to lazy 
banks, fat non-profits, and 
a few Republican fundraisers-
I hauled myself back to the Office of the 
Bursar and wrote out my check. Leaving 
the office with a dent in my checking 
account, I shuddered at the thought of 
the monthly loan payments just a few 
years away. Unless I land a top-paying 
job, the $200 monthly payment will be a 
hefty bill co carry. 

Maybe I should follow my roommate's 
advice and go into student loans.
