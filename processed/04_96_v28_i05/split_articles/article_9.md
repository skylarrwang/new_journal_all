EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Editing many of the pieces for the issue this weekend was unsettling. Dana 
Goodyear's piece about cheating raised numerous questions among our staff about 
their own actions. As one insisted as she flipped through the story, "I didn't feel 
guilty at all when I used that old test." Eva Bonime's piece about Stanley, who 
protests outside of Women's Health Services on a nearby street, was unnerving in 
its own sense. The detailed portrait of an eccentric activist who harasses women 
seeking counseling captured an extreme in the abortion debate. When sending 
Marisa Galvez, our photography editor, to photograph Stanley for the issue, we 
learned he had been arrested for his haranguing. This led to a tricky design 
question. Photographs of hanging plastic fetuses, which the photographer received 
from other pro-lifers outside the clinic, became disturbing images surrounding the 
p1ece. 

Even Gabriel Snyder's lighter take on the trials and tribulations of hunting 
down the missing $54 from his student loans raised discomfiting questions about 
the federal student loan system. Among our Points of Departure, David Hoffmap 
brought us to a virtual world on 'the Internet where those who are dealing with 
suicide receive solace from strangers. Sara Harkavy traveled to a neighboring 
Church of Scientology to introduce us to the peculiar mindset of this 
organization. 

Dan Murphy's Between the Vines poked fun at the dilemma that was 
continuously debated to no resolution throughout the weekend: how do we, as 
students, deal with the strike of Locals 34 and 35. With early morning wake ups 
and a lack of dining halls, students cannot feign ignorance. Yet, students on both 
sides of the debate, and the majority who stand confused in the middle, all share 
the uneasy feeling that they are witnessing a struggle without simple resolution. 

These students consider Yale a part of their identity but also empathize with the 
strikers as fellow individuals. Students avoid crossing the picket lines by not 
dining at Commons, but turn their heads in uneasiness when they approach those 
picket lines on their way to class. Such discomfort, although a daily occurrence, is 
rarely admitted except in whispers. All of these unsettling issues are most often 
veiled. We began to joke and tease about the vices we use to assuage these 
uncomfortable feelings. One writer admitted to returning to his empty room and 
a six-pack for solace; others of us admitted to stress-induced obsessions with 
chocolate and cigarettes. 

This issue marks the first of a new staff and editorial 1:-oard. Our goal in the 
upcoming year is to continue to address those stories that leave us most unsettled.
