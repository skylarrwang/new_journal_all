Liza Grandia appears to be your 
typical Yale senior. At 9 a.m., clad in a 
simple-knit sweater and blue jeans, she 
scrambles to eat her breakfast after a 
morning class. She is anxious to graduate, 
but unlike other seniors, she is not 
looking for a job at Goldman Sachs or 
Merrill Lynch. Instead, she is hoping to 
make her third trip to Peten, a small 
village in Guatemala where she first 
worked during a year-long leave of 
absence following her sophomore year. 


Grandia claims that before her trip she 
was "willing to go anywhere, do 
anything." Now she concedes that she was 
not entirely prepared for what she 
encountered in Peten. Some aspects of her 
adventure were out of her hands, such as 
the military coup in a nearby village just a 
week before her arrival or the flus and 
intestinal diseases that she caught. Other 
problems could have been avoided. 
Conservation International, for instance, 
had told her that she would be working 
on organized women's cooperatives. When 
she got there, she found that not only did 
they not exist, but the farmers were also 
all men. 


Finding housing also proved qifficult. 
On the third day after her arrival she was 
driven to the middle of the village. With 
minimal knowledge of Spanish, she was 
left alone. Grandia was fortunate to find a 
friendly host family, but living with up to 
eight other people in a one-room, 
thatched-roof house with neither running 
water nor electricity could not have 
seemed much like home. 


On, her first day of teaching, 
Grandia was startled when the young 
students, upon seeing her, bolted out 
of the room. She learned later that 
the children believed the local rumor 
that foreigners kidnap children to sell 
their organs for medical research. It 
took a long time both to convince 
them that she was not a murderer and 
to return them to class. 


Despite the headaches, Grandia 
describes her experience as a privilege. 
"Images of the Third World on the 
news are horrifying," she says. "What 
are people's daily lives like? I guess 
that is something that I really wanted 
to know because 75 percent of the 
world, lives in utter poverty." 


Grandia valued her experience so 
much that she decided to return to Peten 
last summer for three months. The close 
relationships that she had established with 
the villagers, especially the women, grew 
stronger. "It was really nice to go back and 
begin old friendships again," Grandia 
remarks. 


Now, Grandia is encouraging other 
Yalies to follow her example and try the 
Third World as an alternative workplace 
to law firms and Wall Street. As creator 
and head of a new job bank at Yale, 
Grandia is compiling a list of 
organizations that offer summer, term-
time, and post-graduate job opportunities 
in the nonprofit sector, especially in 
developing countries. Undergraduate 
Career Services will make the list available 
to students both on the Internet and in its 
resource library. 


"I just wanted to make this 
information accessible to students so that 
working in Ecuador would be as easy as 
getting a Proctor & Gamble internship," 
Grandia says. "Even if people don't 
necessarily devote the rest of their lives to 
working in the developing world, certainly 
the knowledge of economic poverty will 
be carried with them throughout their 
lives."
