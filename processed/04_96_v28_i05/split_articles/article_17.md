"let's go take pictures of Mr. Christleyl" The 
third-graders scamper down the hallway, 
cameras in hand, frantically searching for 
their next subject. 

Taking pictures is exciting and more fun. Usually 
adults don't let us use equipment like that, but now 
they trust us.

Robert Price, a third-grade teacher at 
Lincoln Bassett Elementary School, is not 
afraid of letting his students use cameras, 
whether 35mm or digital. Actually, he 
thinks it's critical. 

"I've done workshops with other 
teachers who worry about letting their kids 
use such expensive equipment as learning 
tools. But the only one who has dropped 
the digital camera so far is me," says Price. 

Over the past year, the students in 
Price's class have taken photographs in and 
around school, designed World Wide Web 
sites, and made lifesize images of 
themselves, called "stand-ups," to place 
around New Haven. These multimedia 
activities are the result of Lincoln Bassett's 
after school resources and New Haven 
community programs like Leadership, 
Education, Athletics in Partnership 
(L.E.A.P.). 

Price's use of up-to-date, high-tech 
tools creates an atmosphere of "respect and 
trust," the key to his teaching style. 

"These are real tools for real people, 
and if you believe in kids, they will believe 
in themselves," he says. "If kids learn to 
manipulate the media, they'll learn when 
they're being manipulated."
