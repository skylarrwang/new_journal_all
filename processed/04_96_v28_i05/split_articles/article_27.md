they've even placed local forecasters on the payroll so that no one 
will be expecting it. 

8) Deciding where to eat can be a major life decision. 
With the newfound freedom to choose where to eat, you 
actually have to spend time thinking about what you might like. 
The part of my brain that used to be taken up with thoughts 
about winning the lottery has been occupied lately with each day's 
pressing dining decisions. 

9) GESO never really mattered. 
The single most debated "issue" of the fall semester has 
become the most ignored "organization" of the present. After six 
months of grandstanding about forcing Levin to talk to GESO, 
the Federation has dropped the graduate student group from both 
its letterhead and its rhetoric. 

10) The $5 mi/luhake at Clark's Dairy is worth every penny. 
My roommate has figured out that with $105, he can buy 21 
of them every week. When he walks in to Clark's, everybody 
shouts out his name. 

11) You can fry eggs on a halogen lamp. 
You can also cook with hot-pots, microwaves, barbecues, 
campfires, blowdryers, or just about any other heat-producing 
device now that the strike is diverting fire inspectors. 

12) Sturknts have more rhythm than workers. 
Despite their suburban backgrounds, the members of SLAC 
who walk the picket lines carry a beat much better than the union 
members. The SLAC pickets on Friday afternoons are almost 
funky, with double-beats and improvisations, as compared to the 
simple, steady thumping that the union seems to prefer. 

13) Beer with lunch at Naples is good. 
The freshmen are only there on Thursday nights, but the grad 
students are there everyday for lunch, and joining them for a 
Rolling Rock really helps your performance in those tough 
afternoon sections. 

14) The four basic food groups: Lucky Charms, Cap'n Crunch, Cocoa 
Krispies, and Cookie Crisp. 
The cereal route is very popular among Yalies who want to 
save their rebate check. Sugar-coated flakes, tiny cookies, 
marshmallows, and colored candies aren't just for breakfast. 

15) Off-campus sturknts must be really sorry they're not living on. 
They may have better food, nicer apartments, cheaper rent, 
and kitchens, but nobody's giving them $105 in spending money. 
If Yale is really concerned about the off-campus exodus, it could 
make this weekly paycheck a permanent policy, regardless of the 
strike, as an incentive to keep students in the colleges. 

16) The strike is more e./fictive than SlimFast. 
Everybody claims to be losing weight and suffering from 
malnutrition, unable or unwilling to pay more than $12 for 
decent food found anywhere and everywhere in the naked city. 
Perhaps Yale could present the strike positively as a diet plan to 
prospective freshman who could stand to shed a few pounds at 
the Yale Fat Farm. 

17) Visiting restaurants is nice, but I don't Like Living there. 
Settle the strike now.
