It was the oversized, three-
dimensional cross hanging on the 
door that first caught my eye. Its 
otherworldliness set it apart from the 
mundane commerciality of the strip 
mall. The image demanded closer 
inspection. As I peered into t he 
window, I noticed a sign in the doorway, 
offering free personality tests. I had come 
to the right place: the Whalley Avenue 
Church of Scientology. 


I opened the door and warily walked 
up the stairs leading to the main level.

Peter, an enthusiastic test proctor, was the 
first to greet me. His interrogation began 
immediately. Wherq did I live? What did I 
do for a living? Why had I come to the 
Church of Scientology? I told him that I 
was a Yale student looking to fill an 
increasing spiritual gap in my life. Peter 
rewarded my revelation with an 
impromptu sermon on the lack of 
spirituality at Yale. His litany 
bemoaned Yalies' misplaced 
priorities on grades and 
material success. Peter told 
me that the Church of 
Scientology would fill my 
spiritual void. The words of 
L. Ron Hubbard, the creator 
of Scientology, would fill the 
void that the words of my 
economics textbook could 
not. Then he gave me a 
personality test. 


The test ~as on a pink 
legal-sized piece of paper and 
was 
made 
up of 
160 
questions. Some of the questions were 
standard, like the one asking how 
frequently I experienced feelings of 
depression. I was surprised by a question 
that asked if I was prepared to accept a life 
of strict discipline. I worried that the 
question was assessing my readiness to 
join the Church of Scientology. I finished 
the test in about half an hour, and Peter 
took it to be scored by computer. 


Peter invited me to watch an 
instructional video while I waited for him 
to interpret the results of my personality 
test. The video was a montage of camera 
shots, voiced over by L. Ron Hubbard. A 
soundtrack played as Hubbard praised 
himself for finding the answers to life's 
questions and condemned others for being 
blind to his truths. The music was light 
and airy during images of the church and 
Hubbard, dark and foreboding during 
shots of universities and psychiatric 
hospitals. 


After the ten-minute video, Peter led 
me into another room so we could discuss 
8 
the test. He handed me a chan scaled 
between -100 and 100. A line graph 
showed me where I had placed in each of 
the categories: stable, happy, composed, 
certain, active, aggressive, responsible/ 
causative, correct estimation, and 
communication level. 


With the help of the chart, Peter 
showed me that I had problems to work 
out. He told me that the area of my life 
that needed immediate attention was my 
low happiness level and insisted that there 
was a destructive force in my life. Most 
likely a friend or family member was 
attempting to undermine my efforts to be 
happy. As I ran through a list of my family 
and closest friends in my head, I told 
Peter that I couldn't think of anyone who 
made me feel bad about myself. He was 
adamant, though, and told me that my 
lack of recognition was certainly a sign 
that I had internalized the criticism of the 
destructive force-whoever that might be. 


Peter suspended his analysis just long 
enough to ask me if I had told anyone 
about my feelings of unhappiness. When I 
told him I had not, his face brightened. 
The decision was for the best, he said, 
because people try to do "weird things" to 
unstable individuals like me. He seemed 
to think I needed protection from the 
insidious influences of freshmen 
counselors. They would only send me 
back to CCL to study more, so I could 
work more, so I could make more money, 
so I could do more drugs .... 


Peter pointed out that, in addition to 
my unhappiness I had a low "active" score. 
Appatently, I just did not do enough, 
academically or extracurricularly. When I 
expressed concern and a desire to change, 
Peter assured me that, although I didn't 
have the answers to my problems, 
Scientology did. 


After discussing my results, Peter got 
down to business. He suggested I buy a 
copy of Dian~tics, L. Ron Hubbard's 
treatise on Scientology. After I asked if I 
could check the book out of the library 
instead, he offered as an alternative that I 
purchase some $4 pamphlets. The 
pamphlets were excerpts from Dian~tics 
that would be especially helpful to me. 
Peter thought I might find some of the 
$75 courses helpful as well. I deferred for 
the moment, since I only had bus fare 
with me. Peter's face fell slightly at my 
refusal, but he didn't push. Instead, he let 
me know about the free lecture in two 
days. 


I didn't go back for the lecture. I also 
didn't buy the books. I didn't even check 
Dianetics out of the library as I had 
promised. But Peter's readings of my chart 
pushed a very big button. Taking five 
classes, writing for Yale publications, 
volunteering, and attending martial arts 
classes, I hadn't really considered myself 
inactive. But as soon as I got home, I 
called a tutoring organization and signed 
myself up.
