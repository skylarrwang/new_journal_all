What is that timeworn adage about 
finding a whole new world inside of every 
book? There are as many different 
possibilities as there are books. Some of 
them we recognize, some we dream about, 
others we fear and even disdain. Books 
transport us to worlds long since past and 
to others millions of miles away. But most 
of us are probably unaware of another 
world that exists today, the world of books 
themselves. 


While many of us dance around the 
outskirts of the book world, plucking its 
fruits from time to time, few of us have 
visited the world of book collectors, their 
rare works, and clandestine shops. In fact, 
to the ordinary, even semi-informed 
observer this mysterious world seems to be 
one of the past as well. In William Reese's 
(SM '7_7) informed opinion, however, this 
is a misconception with obvious origins. 
Physical signs of the extinction of 
book collectors abound, he explains. 
Where New York City's "Book Row" once 
filled a full block of used book stores, 
housing millions of books, it has now 
been reduced to the single, although 
impressive, Strand. "It's too difficult for 
many book stores to be successful in cities, 
so they are pushed out to the country or 
forced to close," Reese reports. 


Perhaps foresight of this inspired book 
collector Adrian Van Sinderen (' 1 0) to 
establish the Yale Book Collecting Prize in 
1957 for sophomores and seniors with 
impressive collections. A panel of six 
judges currently including Stephen Parks, 
a curator at the Beinecke Rare Books and 
Manuscript Library, and Sylvia Abbate, 
who is Van Sinderen's granddaughter, 
determines a winner based on the choice 
of books as they relate to a particular topic 
of interest. As Reese, a judge since his 
graduation from Yale, puts it, "A good 
collection of books is one for which the 
sum is more than just the individual 
parts." 


Every year, applicants submit brief 
essays describing their interest in a chosen 
topic as well as in book collecting itself. 
The judges then spend a week trooping 
from fourth-floor dorm room to fourth-
floor dorm room-or so it usually seems, 
the judges complain-in order to visit the 
various collections. After about a week of 
such appointments, the group meets to 
discuss the applicants and then to decide 
upon a final winner. 


If the book world is a thing of the 
past, then Yale exists in a time-warp. The 
senior prize, announced in mid-April, 
attracted 30 applicants this year, more 
than ever before. Book collecting, it 
seems, has a life here at Yale. Beinecke, 
which houses some of the most important 
collections of rare books that exist today, 
including some of Van Sinderen's, plays a 
significant role in the book world. 
Because of 
Beinecke~ 
location 
and 
New 
Haven's proximity to 
New York City, the 
center of the book world, 
Reese chose to stay and 
continue his collecting in New 
Haven once his Yale career 
ended. Reese started collecting in high 
school and started dealing in college. His 
collection on Americana won the 
Sophomore Book Collecting Prize, and his 
reference and bibliography books won the 
Senior Prize. His collection on Americana, 
now totaling 50,000 books, rests in two 
neighboring brownstones on a row of 
identical, Temple Street houses. 


Reese employs a staff to catalogue 
his ever-growing collection. Joseph Bray 
(TC '94), currently employed at William 
Reese Books, carries on the mysterious 
book collecting tradition. As a two time 
winner for his books on bees and bee-
keeping, Bray is expanding his collection 
from the original 20 for which he won 
during his sophomore year. He has used 
the money from the prizes, in addition to 
outside funds, to build his collection up 
to its present stature of 1,000 books and 
pamphlets. 


Bray's favorite items in his collection 
are the rare pamphlets written by 
nineteenth century beekeepers, who are 
typically "stubborn, old, hermit types." 
He was excited to discover the unresolved 
scandal of a crooked female dealer from 
Maine who ran a mail order bee-business 
in 
the 
1880s. 
Many beekeepers 
complained in their writings that she 
collected their money but never produced 
the hives. 


Bray, who keeps bees himself, is aided 
by the invaluable advice that his book 
collection provides. He is currently 
tending two hives in the backyard of the 
Beekeepers Association of Connecticut. 


The world of book collecting, like that 
of beekeeping, still exists. Indeed, 
although the glamour of New York City's 
Book Row has faded, the art of book 
collecting flourishes inconspicuously in 
Reese's houses on Temple Street.
