"Did you have an abortion in your past?" 
Stanley likes to repeat himself, especially 
when he comes up with a particularly clever 
idea or phrase. These phrases often evolve 
into schoolyard-type chants, such as, "Your 
mother gave you life." Another favorite is 
the cliched yet singable "a-BOR-tion is 
MUR-der." He elaborates on this slogan, 
by challenging everyone to check in 
Webster's Dictionary and see that the 
definitions for "abortion" and "murder" are 
identical: "the willful taking of human life." 
Another common chant is "You're the 
loser," or variations such as, "Don't be a 
loser. Be a winner." He complains that 
people change the meanings of words and 
now spell the word "love" L-U-S-T. From 
this concept, he sometimes progresses to the 
enigmatic chant, "When you love, you only 
have small problems. When you love, you 
only have small problems." 


A
apport bordering on affection 
develops between Stanley and the 
scores. They greet each other in the 
morning, engage in lengthy discussions, and 
even share an understanding of certain 
rules. He vacillates between mean name-
calling and a subtle appreciation of their 
company. On one beautiful day, he looks up 
gratefully and asks with great profundity, 
"Why is the sky blue?" to which an escort 
explains the physical 
concepts of 
wavelengths and color. Wearing the face of a 
proud father, Stanley counters, "God made 
it that way." On another day, he decides to 
quote Shakespeare to illustrate his often-
stared point that if you're lying to yourself, 
you'll never be happy. Trying to say, "To 
thine own self be true," he fumbles with the 
words until deciding that it means, "If 
you're not true to others, you can't be true 
to yourself." He becomes confused when he 
notices that something doesn't sound quite 
right ·and starts to reverse his logic, 
eventually returning to h is initial 
interpretation. He then explains that·he has 
never read Shakespeare. He should, but he 
doesn't have the time. That's for leisure, and 
he has too many other things to do. 


His childlike manner can also 
unexpectedly express itself as harsh cruelty. 
One day, when an escort asks him why he 
never yells at the men since they are equally 
responsible for pregnancies, he shouts in 
reply, "It's the women who are consenting 
to sex. Why are you women consenting to 
have sex with every Tom, Dick, and Harry?" 
When an Asian woman who counsels 
victims of rape and domestic violence in the 
clinic steps out of her car and smiles at the 
escorts, Stanley calls, "Hey, it's the smiling 
Chinese woman!" Over the various 
exclamations of shock emitted by the 
escorts and other people standing outside, 
be asks her if she is going to go murder 
babies, too. He has no qualms about 
describing his favorite story of a woman 
dying from a botched illegal abortion as a 
patient walks toward the clinic with her 
small children, who are bewildered by the 
old man yelling at their mother. 


Stanley gets angry at the escorts because, 
he says, they're helping make abortions 
happen. He often tells them that the Devil 
has got them under his control. He argues 
one day, more eloquently than usual, "The 
women all have the ambulatory capacity to 
walk themselves to the door," meaning that 
the escorts are unnecessary. "You're as 
helpful as-" He pauses, searching for ~ 
simile. "You're like a pimple. You're about as 
useful as a pimple on a face." At this 
pronouncement he basks in self-satisfaction 
for a few moments, and then continues, 
"You know what I mean? It's useless."

n his more genial days, Stanley has 
been known to compliment the 
escorts for being dedicated, even if 
their morals are wrong. "Where are the 
people on the life side?" he laments. Seeing 
two escorts, both female, walk arm-in-arm, 
he smiles and asks tauntingly if they are 
going steady. Remembering a moment later 
that the escorts don't tolerate this sort of 
comment, he hastily returns to his 
schoolboy defensiveness and insists, "I can 
say thar. That's harmless." When he 
inquires about an escort's AIDS Awareness 
ribbon, she asks him if he wants one. He 
refuses, for fear that it might be 
"misunderstood." People might think he 
was one of those liberal-minded people, the 
people who don't believe in the Truth. Since 
many of the escorts are Yale students, 
Stanley frequently reminds them that he is 
older and has the Truth, saying, "You know 
what your opinion's worth? It's worth about 
three cents." One escort a$ks him why 
people in such highly educated areas tend to 
be pro-choice. "Education corrupts," he 
says. 


though Stanley's Truth is 
bsolute, it still must yield to 
ederal and state law. He has 
faced several lawsuits, and is forbidden to 
step on the property of Women's Health 
Services. His expenses are mainly lawsuits 
and transportation, since he splits his time 
between the clinics in New Haven and 
Bridgeport, thirty minutes away. Kept 
several feet from the escorts and the door to 
the clinic-a parking lot serves as a buffer 
zone between the sidewalk and the 
building-Stanley tells everyone who walks 
toward the door that ''I'm not allowed on 
the property, because I have the Truth." He 
entreats them to come to him. As he follows 
a woman down the street one morning, a 
policeman pulls up in his car and says, 
"That's harassment, Stanley. You were in 
court last week." 


Stanley's main purpose in coming to the 
clinic is to save these foolish women who 
are being deceived by the abortion doctors. 
With a mixture of smugness and 
indignation in his voice, he explains that the 
doctors are tricking women in order to 
make money. "Women's Health Services? 
That's just a front. This place would go out 
of business if they weren't doing abortions." 
Aiming his voice at the second-story 
window-the room where the abortion 
procedures take place-he spends the day 
trying to spread his saving Truth. When the 
day is over, he packs his stroller and his 
Virgin Mary back into the van and drives 
away, muttering to himself, "You foolish, 
naive, gullible women ... foolish ... na"ive ... 
gullible ... foolish women."
