'' Y:ou foolish, nai've, gullible woman ... They're trying to 
trick you .. .l have the Truth ... Can I give you a list of 
good doctors?" A van stands parked on the corner of 
Humphrey and State Streets, plastered with bumper 
stickers and proudly displaying posters on its front and back that 
read THEY'RE KILLING BABIES HERE. Beside the van, 72-year old 
Stanley paces back and forth as he tries relentlessly to lead hundreds 
of misguided women to the "Truth." The women he addresses 
outside Women's Health Services range from physicians to teenagers 
to child-toting mothers, but he spends the majority of his time 
talking and arguing with the clinic escorts-Yale students and New 
Haven residents who volunteer to protect women from Stanley's 
harassment. 

Besides his oversized snow boots, newsboy hat, gray car coat, 
Stanley 
gloves duct-taped at the fingertips, and green polyester pants, which 
have gone out of style and come back since he's owned them, 
Stanley also wears a blown-up newspaper mounted on cardboard. 
The sign rests on his bent forearms and remains wedged tightly in 
place underneath his chin, emphasizing an unusually strong and 
weathered jaw. The article tells the story of a woman who died in a 
hospital after trying to give herself ------------------------- an abortion in an alley, because she 
couldn't raise the money for the 
clinical procedure. Pro-choice 
activists usually claim this type of 
Story as one of their strongest 
arguments for legal and funded abortion, but Stanley has embraced 
it as a major part of his crusade, muttering repeatedly, day after day, 
"What a way to go. On the table, killing your baby." He considers 
this death the worst kind because if the woman is on the table under 
anesthesia, she cannot repent to God and must therefore go to Hell. 

A different side of Stanley appears when he deals with men. 
Rather than the fact-spouting and preaching that he uses to save 
women, Stanley turns into a schoolboy. His face takes on the 
countenance of a small child, and he approaches the men and 
whispers to them, as though he is disclosing important man-to-man 
secrets. He makes one of his more abstract remarks after a man 
walks by and yells at him one day. Stanley turns to the escorts and 
says, "People here are weird. The lezzies and the homos are ruin,ing 
the neighborhood." Women are usually afraid to talk to him, 
because he is prone to following them down the sueet when they 
leave the clinic, but most of the men enjoy arguing with him. They 
often tell him to get a job and swear at him, which Stanley always 
takes to mean they have something on their conscience. He taunts,
