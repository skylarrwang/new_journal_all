According to the Office of the Bursar, I still owed $54. 
Though I had taken out a loan for $1,350 this 
semester, Yale had only received $1 ,296. Somewhere in 
the maze of paperwork stretching froq1 the bank to 
Yale, 4 percent of my loan had disappeared. The cashier at the 
accounts office said it was routine for a small amount to be 
deducted from student loans, but she could not tell me why. 
My loan is just one of 6.7 million federal student loans the 
government guarantees each year. The federal government plays a 
small role compared to the host of private institutions that 
approve, issue, service, and insure student loans. Since the 
student loan program started three decades ago, federally 
guaranteed loans have spawned a $23 billion per year industry. As 
colleges raise tuition at twice the rate of inflation, more and more 
students must take out larger and larger 
loans. The student loan business is 
booming. If 4 percent of student 
loans really routinely disappear, 
close to $1 billion vanishes 
inexplicably each year. 

Taking 
the 
cashier's advice, 
I followed the 
missing $54 to the 
financial aid office. 
The financial aid 
officer that I spoke 
to began by ex-
plaining how my 
loan works. First, 
the federal govern-
ment authorized a 
Stafford Loan for 
me. Then I applied to 
a guaranty agency-
the Connecticut Student 
Loan Foundation-to guarantee my loan. After it approved my 
application, my lender, the New Haven Savings Bank, authorized 
the servicer it hires to handle its student loans-the Student 
Loan Marketing Association (or "Sallie Mae" to friends)-to 
dispense the. loan money to Yale. After I graduate, Sallie Mae and 
I will become much closer as I begin to make my monthly 
payments. 

As visions of foundations and associations danced in my 
head, the financial aid officer told me that for Stafford Loans 
such as mine, fees are deducted from the loan before the funds 
come to the school. In my case, 4 percent was taken out. Since 
the fees are lumped into my much larger tuition payment, I 
usually paid them without even noticing. She explained that part 
of the fees went to the New Haven Savings Bank and part went 
to the Connecticut Student Loan Foundation. 

Confused about thi~ last group, I asked, ''Are they a federal 
agency?" 

"No, they are a non-profit company that insures your 
loan for the bank in case you default," the officer answered. 

"I thought my loan was guaranteed by the federal 
government," I replied. 

"It is," 
she 
explained. 
"The 
government 
would 
pay 
Connecticut 
Student 
Loan 
Foundation if you default." 

More confused, I asked, "Why 
doesn't the government just pay 
the bank directly instead?" 

"I don't know," the financial 
aid officer said. 

My confusion led me to 
do some homework. 
The Stafford Loan is the 
centerpiece of the federal govern-ment's 
Guaranteed Loan Program, which dates back to 
Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. While banks write the

student loan. 

checks to schools, the government guarantees the loan against 
default. The government also pays the interest that accrues on 
subsidized Stafford Loans while the student is still in school. 
Instead of paying millions of dollars to lenders, servicers, and 
guaranties on virtually risk-free investments, an alternative to the 
tangled web of the student loan business exists. In the early weeks 
of his Administration, President Bill Clinton (LAW '73) made 
good on his campaign promise to create the Direct Student Loan 
Program. Under the new Direct Loan Program, the federal 
government acts as the lender, s.ervicer, and guaranty for its 
student loans. Clinton originally envisioned replacing the 
Guaranteed Loan Program entirely, but Congress forced the 
Direct Loan Program to instead be phased in so that it now 
includes 30 percent of all federal student loans. Unfortunately, I 
cannot use it because Yale chooses not to participate in the new 
program. 

The trail of my missing $54 next led me to my lender, the 
New Haven Savings Bank. Joan Stellabotte, the student 
loan manager for New Haven Savings, assured me that 4 
percent worth of fees is deducted not just from my loans but 
from all Stafford Loans. The federal government, Joan said, 
charges the bank a 3 percent origination fee for each loan it 
makes, and the bank, in turn, passes the fee on to me. She 
explained that the fee is meant to recoup the government's 
processing costs. Since loans are new business for the banks, the 
origination fee is a sort of finder's fee charged by the government. 
Once the bank passes the fee on to the borrower, however, it 
becomes a surcharge on a government benefit-kind of like 
charging food stamp recipients a fee for their food stamps. The 
other 1 percent, Joan continued, goes to the Connecticut Student 
Loan Foundation. 

The fees are taken out of my loan check, so while I 
borrowed-and will have to pay back-the full $1,350 this 
semester, Yale only received $1,296. Now, the Bursar's office not 
only wants me to make up the $54 difference out of my pocket, 
but I will also have to pay back the money I never received on my 
loan. With interest, it will 
come to about $80. For the eight 
semesters that I borrow, the $134 in fees will add up to over 
$1,000. And I am a relatively small borrower. Students who 
borrow $17,125, the maximum Stafford Loan amount, will pay 
thousands of dollars in hidden fees alone. 

I asked Joan if I would have to pay these sort of fees on, for 
example, a new car loan. She said no, but countered that the 
interest rate would be much higher. Actually, when I checked the 
New Haven Savings Bank's rates for new car loans, I learned that 
the current interest rate is a quarter of a point lower. 

For banks, student loans are a lucrative source of revenue. 
While the government makes interest payments, the banks, in 
practice, face no financial risk. Granting a student loan, then, is 
as safe as holding a government bond, except the loan earns a 
much higher return. The bank collects 8.25 percent interest on a 
Stafford Loan, but only about 6 percent on a government bond. 
In the multi-billion dollar student loan market, a difference of 
2.5 percent translates into hundreds of millions of dollars. 

After the visit to the financial aid office, I was still confused 
about the difference between the lender (New Haven Savings) 
and the servicer (Sallie Mae). Joan told me that although New 
Haven Savings owns the loan right now, Sallie Mae will buy the 
loan from the bank after I graduate and will collect my payments. 
Wondering why Sallie Mae would buy the debt, I asked if New 
Haven Savings sells the loan at a discount, but Joan told me that 
the bank gets full value. In the meantime, she continued, the 
federal government pays the New Haven Savings Bank any 
interest that accrues on my loan. So, when the bank faces any risk 
on the loan (the risk that I will not pay it back), the bank collects 
the full balance on the loan, already having made a killing in 
government interest payments. Of course, the loan is stilL 
guaranteed by the government when Sallie Mae owns it. Sallie 
Mae will then make a killing in interest directly from me. When I 
explained the bank and Sallie Mae's deal to my roommate, an 
economics major, he exclaimed, "What a great business!" 

Proponents of the Direct Loan Program praise it for
