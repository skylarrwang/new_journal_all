EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
But some students 
blame themselves. A student 
in Associate Professor Malcolm 
Boshier's Physics 200a class 
bombed her first exam. Because 
Boshier was known to recycle 
questions with some regularity, a 
friend offered her a copy of the 
preceding year's exam from a fraternity's 
archive. Worried that the professor would 
wise up to them, students with the exam 
kept it quiet. "We didn't know how many 
people knew. We thought it would be really 
nice if he kept doing this." The morning of 
the second exam rolled around. The student 
had been up late the night before studying 
the old exam. She entered the exam room 
feeling guilty. "I was terrified that the exam 
would be exactly the same. I was scared I 
was going to get a grade I didn't deserve." 
She found that about half of the questions 
were precisely those she had studied from 
the fr.aternity exam. She continued to use 
old exams to study, but her conscience 
nagged her.

ulture of cheating thrives because 
scenarios like the one that occurred 
n Boshier's class happen frequently 
at Yale. They usually remain undetected or 
unproved. Professors and TAs may have 
their suspicions that something funny is 
going on, but there is often no hard 
evidence. Amy Francis (GRD '96), a TA in 
MB&B, is certain that cheating goes on all 
the time right under her nose. "We do have 
a feeling for whether students are 
understanding or not. You get a totally 
clueless person handing you a beautiful 
piece of work. You can't say 'Listen, this 
doesn't sound 
like you, you 
sound like an 
idiot in class.' I 
assume that it's their 
own work. I'm just 
never going to know." 
But the equation 
just doesn't add up. If cheatin g is as 
common as these people suggest, especially 
in Group IV courses, then the lack of 
response by the administration remains a 
mystery. Why doesn't each of us know a 
dozen peers who have suffered consequences 
for their actions? 
The answer may be that students are 
being caught but not punished. According 
to Zilm, the faculty in his department 
hesitate to even bring cases with hard 
evidence to the Ex Comm. He describes 
faculty members who have taken actions 
against students as once-bitten, twice-shy. 
The scenario goes something like this: after 
just one too many humiliations in which 
the disciplinary body didn't even give a slap 
on the wrist to an offending student in what 
the department felt to be a cut and dry case, 
the faculty loses faith. When the Ex Comm 
does not act, the faculty takes matters into 
its own hands. "A professor may feel that 
the strongest thing he can do is to have it 
affect the student's grade. There is not a 
disciplinary body to back up the faculty." 
Tricia Serio (GRD '97), also a TA in 
MB&B, lays the blame elsewhere. She says 
that it is not so much the lack of a Yale 
disciplinary response, but apathy on the 
part of professors that fosters cheating. In 
one instance, a student of hers plagiarized 
directly from a published research journal.
