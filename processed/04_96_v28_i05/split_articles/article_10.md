To the Editor: 
Alec Bemis' article (TN], February 9, 
1996, "The ABCs of Student Activism") 
concerning student activism was not only 
poorly researched and misleading, but it 
also promotes and excuses the student 
apathy on our campus. As a member of 
Yale Homeless and Hunger Action Project 
(YHHAP), I am truly only qualified to 
comment on Mr. Bemis' statements 
regarding this group in the article. 

Mr. Bemis laments that "once again 
members of the Yale Acronym Corps 
{YAC) have failed to state their positions 
with more clarity than the administration 
they attack." What he has failed to do is 
contact YHHAP to see if this is, in fact, the 
case. If he had bothered to contact the 
organizations about which he was writing, 
he would have found, much to his surprise, 
that YHHAP has had a concrete position 
regarding the casual worker program since 
long before the strike began. This posicion 
has been made public ro both the 
newspapers on campus, the national press, 
the administracion, and the unions. 

If he had taken the rime to contact 
YHHAP, he would have discovered rhar, 
after meecing with YHHAP members, the 
union leadership decided to include 
YHHAP's proposals regarding homeless 
workers in their own demands. This has, in 
many ways, changed the tenor of the 
debate over the casual worker issue and 
ilJuminated the truly exploitative nature of 
this hiring program. In no way do I imply 
that we have won. I do insist, however, that 
YHHAP has put its mark on these 
negotiations and awakened undergraduate 
awareness of an issue that is of vital interest 
to us and all of New Haven. 

This realistic assessment of the 
undergraduate student efforts is what Mr. 
Bemis lacks. All sense of hope is quashed 
by his irrepressible cynicism. Perhaps if he 
had the maturity to recognize that not all 
social injustice crumbles immediately in 
the face of reasoned opposition, then he 
would give the credit to student organizers 
that we truly deserve. Campus acrivisrs 
have not ended injustice ar Yale or in New 
Haven, but we sure are trying, and our 
efforts would be a whole lot more 
rewarding with some welJ deserved respect.

I was surprised by "The ABCs of 
Student Activism" {TN], February 9, 1996) 
by Alec Bemis in which he bashes one of 
the senior officers of the University Police. 
In addition to his childish reference to 
"official police cap with fuz.z.y ear flaps" and 
"post-doughnut mode," the story included 
the officer's picture to aggrandize the 
attack. It appears to me that the universal 
suppon The New journal expresses towards 
the labor movement should include the 
Police Benevolent Association. I am 
interested in what event spurred Bemis' 
assault on the police. 

It would behoove you to understand 
that the days of the stereotypical "Car 54 
where are you?" are over. University Police 
officers are highly trained professionals 
dealing with criminal incidents as well as 
responding to the safety issues of students 
who are frequently "overwhelmed" with 
campus life. 

The police officer depicted in Bemis' 
article is a fine individual who has made a 
significant impact on the security of rhe 
Yale campus in his 29 plus years. Why Mr. 
Bemis would capriciously depict this officer 
in such an insulting manner is beyond me. 

This officer will continue to represent 
the Yale community in his sworn role until 
he chooses ro retire. He will not treat the 
srudents differently because of this anicle, 
nor will he abandon his oath to serve and 
protect. Neverrheless, to damage an 
individual's self respect is simply a cruel 
way of expressing one's freedom of speech. 
Especially those individuals whose sole 
purpose is to keep our campus safe and 
secure.
