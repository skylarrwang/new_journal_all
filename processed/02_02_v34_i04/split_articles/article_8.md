**And Keep It Holy**

THE SUMMER BEFORE HER FRESHMAN 
year at Yale, Shari Goldman Gottlieb 
worked as a counselor at a Spanish 
camp in Minnesota; she . was "the 
token East Coast girl, the token Jew." 
"If you're looking for a strong Jewish 
community," she warns, "don't go to 
northern Minnesota. There was no 
context for me. I didn't know how to 
observe on my own." Just before leaving for 
Yale, Shari's religious differences became 
impossible to ignore. To christen new 
campgrounds, a Catholic priest did a bene-
diction and Shari was sprinkled with holy 
water. "They said it was appropriate 
because it was a representative religion for 
the Spanish-speaking world." 

The next day, still chilled by her 
unwanted blessing, Shari set off for her 
new life at college: "My parents drove me 
up to Yale. That night we went to Shabbat 
services at Slifka Center. I was very much 
needing a Jewish community." The 
September weeks were packed with Jewish 
holidays and Shari found herself at Slifka 
more often than not. "That was one of the 
main ways that I made friends," she said. 
When the rush of holidays subsided, Shari 
began to make observance of Jewish law a 
permanent focus of her life. 

Shari has not always been observant. 
Although she has always had faith, her par-
ents do not believe if! God and did not 
raise her to follow the practices to which 
she now adheres, such as interdictions on 
email, travel, and handling money on the 
Sabbath. Transplanting her new routine 
back home to Hollis Hills, Queens, is a 
challenge: "It's more difficult to do things 
like observe Shabbat-my parent's idea of a 
fun Saturday morning is driving around to 
Barnes and Noble and I can't do that. 
There is a personal sense of loss. But you 
have to negotiate. I'd rather bend my rules 
than boycott." 

In contrast, Shari encounters few 
roadblocks within Yale's vibrant Jewish 
community. On Friday night, students 
pour into Slifka to pray, sing, and eat. She 
dons a tallis (prayer shawl) to lead 
Conservative services, and after dinner, 
there are onegs-what she calls "Shabbat-
friendly parties"- where there is no music, 
in accordance with the proscription some 
observe against the use of electricity. 

Above all, Shabbat for Shari is a time 
for reflection and regeneration, both per-
sonal and spiritual. "It makes my whole 
week better. It gives me a break." In addi-
tion, the knowledge she has gained here 
allows her to sustain' her practice without 
the support of others. "If I were to go back 
to the camp in Minnesota now," she says,

"I would be able to observe Shabbat on my 
. own." Luckily, she does not have to do this 
at Yale. "When everyone is crazy and wan-
. dering around in their own orbits, Friday 
night, I know there is a home-base com-
munity of people who will be moving at 
a slower pace." She considers her 
entire community healthier for it. 

"I think rhe saying goes: It is not 
the Jews who have preserved 
the Sabbarh, bur the Sabbath 
that has preserved them."
