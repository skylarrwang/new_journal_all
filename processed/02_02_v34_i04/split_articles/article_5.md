ALEJANDRO RoMERo TALKS ABOtrr SCIENCE 
with the enthusiasm of a new convert. "I find 
spirituality in aU these theories. They're so 
beautiful to me. When I see picrures come 
back from the Hubble telescope, for exam-
ple, or when I go out to the field and I look 
at narure, I don't say, 'Oh my God, this is 
wonderful, look at what God created.' I say, 
'Look at what is here that we can try to 
explain.'" 

Before arriving at Yale, Romero believed 
in a different explanation of the universe. As 
a Jehovah's Witness, he spent six hours a 
week in Kingdom Hall, the Witness equiva-
lent of church. An apocalyptic religious 
group, Jehovah's Wimesses believe that Jesus 
was the son of God, but reject the Trinity and 
conventional Christian theology. Founded in 
l872, the Watchtower Society, as the group is 
called, 
anoctpates 
coming 
of 
Armageddon, when only Jehovah's Wimesses 
will be saved. Members cannot salute the 
flag, vote, celebrate holidays, donate blood, 
or join the armed forces. Members of the 
group are also discouraged from associating 
with non-members. "For so much of my 
childhood I was very scared," Romero said, 

"because I would learn [scientific facts] and 
they made perfect sense to me. And yet I'd 
gec.home and I'd be taught that it was a sin 
co believe these things." 

. Chemistry lectures at Yale were a wel-
come alternative to constant theological 
indoctrinacion, and until this semester, 
Romero was a Molecular, Cellular, and 
Developmental Biology major. That he 
could enroll in college at all was an excep-
tion to Witness tradition; higher education 
is considered an unnecessary distraction 
from Witness spiritual goals. Romero 
recently changed his major to Theater 
Studies and has an actor's awareness of 
intense human experience, learned in part 
from years inside houses of worship. 

"When you walk into a church and you see 
these high ceilings and a gigantic cross with 
Jesus in a dramatic pose, and you hear the 
choir, and you smell the incense and you 
see the candles and you see all these peoples 
brought together in one place, how can you 
not feel something? But science gives you 
something else. Science gi~es you che 
truth." 

Truth for Romew, however, conflicts 
severely with Witness ideology, which con-
demns both his fascination with science 
and his homosexuality. He sees his parencs' 
religion as a cult and bemoans his own for-
mer indoctrination. "I used co go to school 
and see my friends and teachers and think, 
'God is going to kill them. God hares 
them."' 

Romero tugs on his shoelaces, coaxing 
them out of bow ties and pulling back on 
the loops. "To tell my parents that I was no 
longer a believer was to tell them that I was 
committing suicide. It was getting me up, 
facing my entire family, the whole congre-
gation, and saying, 'No more."' 

His eyes glaze over, ftxed on the laces. 
"To this day, certain members of my fami-
ly refuse to speak co me." He pauses, 
pulling a shoelace through a loop method-
ically. 

Suddenly, he looks up and confidence 
returns co his eyes. "I will never go back to 
believing in God, because I've found some-
thing bigger and more beautiful than 
Him."
