I BEGAN MY FORAY into Freemasonry on an 
ominously dark afternoon. The lodge 
loomed over Whitney Avenue like Skull 
and Bones on steroids-big and brown, 
with very few windows and two heavily 
fortified doors. I tentatively knocked my 
hand against the iron door, half-hoping 
that no one would answer. No one did. As 
I began to walk away, I noticed a Subaru 
wagon puJling into the small drive 
beside the lodge. A suspicious-
ly normal man in a 
gray sweatsuit got 
out and went to a 
side door. I fol- · · 
lowed at a respect-
ful distance and saw 
several other sweat-
pants-dad men head-
ing for the same door. 
I stopped one before he 
entered the lodge and gave my 
pitch: 
''I'm 
very 
interested 
in 
Freemasonry. Would it be possible for me 
to sit in on one of the meetings to see what 
it is aU about?" The man, about 35 with 
sandy blond hair jutting out from under 
his baseball cap, scoffed at my question. 
"This is a fraternal society, so no, you can't 
sit in." I pleaded my case, but the man 
walked past me into the lodge. Another 
man arrived. His eyes flashed wide and he 
broke into a sympathetic smile when I 
explained my predicament. He told me he 
would take me on a tour of the building, 
but I would nor be allowed to see the meet-
ing because of the "secret rituals." I walked 
in, and my stomach dropped. 

The lodge was designed, according to 
my guide, with a "Greek and Egyptian 
motif in mind." The spectacular decor was 
funded by the lodge's million-dollar 
endowment. The inside is a labyrinth of 
halls and doors. A Familiar-looking man 
popped out from one of the doors wearing 
a white jacket and white pants, with an 
emblem stitched on a loincloth that 
wrapped around his waist like a belt. He 
looked at me suspiciously; I wondered if he 
FEBRUARY 2002 
wore the outfit under his sweatsuit or had 
changed since entering the building. My 
guide and I followed a black and white 
checkered hallway co a cage-like elevator. 
As our ascent halted and the doors slowly 
opened, I found myself in an enormous 
egg-shaped room, where the Masonic 
group performs "dramatic rituals." A bur-
gundy rug covered the floor, and rows of 
green velvet chairs lined the walls. 

The center of the room was 
empty except for an 
altar. I scanned 
the 
room 
for 
bloodstains but 
didn't see any. An 
organ filled the 
back of the room, 
opposite 
a stage 
with large red chairs. 
An emblem shaped like a 
large letter "G" hung above 
them. The ceiling was painted like a 
cloudy sky, with quarter-sized holes in the 
plaster. When I asked why the lodge hadn't 
fixed the holes, my guide rold me that they 
were intentional. The holes were placed 
where stars shone on the night that the 
lodge was built 150 years ago. In each hole 
was a white light that could be rurned on 
when other lights were off. 

Masonry encourages its members to 
live virruous lives, but the riruals are highly 
secretive. Clearly I had not bumped into a 
normal mason, because my guide told me 
that he would gladly reveal the secret riru-
als. Bur he said it would do me no good 
because they are made up of symbols and 
allegories that are designed to be interpret-
ed individually. If he were to tell me about 
them, he would just be imposing his own 
inteqSretation. 

I argued that the exclusion of women 
from the fraternal society was unf.tir. To my 
surprise, my guide agreed, but told me that 
seven "members of the rite" would have to 
agree in order to admit a woman. My guide 
then told me the story of Prince Hall, one 
of George Washington's slaves who snuck 
into a Masonic meeting and saw the secret 
rituals. Washington decided that the only 
thing to do was to initiate Hall into the 
Masonic order. My guide concluded his story 
by staring straight into my eyes and telling 
me, "There is an old elevator shaft in this 
building that has openings in all the meeting 
rooms, you know." I envisioned myself scur-
rying down an elevator shafr watching mys-
terious riruals. Could I be a modern-day 
Prince Hall, the first woman to join an order 
that has been aU male for thousands of years? 

I left the lodge the way I entered it-a 
bit confused. Perhaps I'll go back to the lodge 
on a clear night and see for myself what goes 
on. Of course, I will be unable to reveal any-
thing I see.
