T HE LIGHTS ARE OIM, AND THE AIR IS STALE. Fallen pieces of 
ceiling crumble on the faded carpet that covers the basement 
floor. An old smoke detector intermittently emits a faint beep. 
"People actually used to inhabit this pl'!.ce," Rabbi Daniel Greer, 
who recently bought the properry, tells me as he points to a tiny 
kitchen with an abutting shower stall. "Six families." We walk 
upstairs, past heaps of unread newspapers, to another kitchen, 
where mice have burrowed through the cabinets. Greer explains 
that slumlords once made staggering profits off the house, just 
blocks northwest of Yale, collecting rents of $650 a month through 
federal housing subsidies. 

Now Greer, an ultra-Orthodox Jew, holds the deed to this 
dilapidated Edgewood area residence, and he plans to renovate it 
fully-a job that could cost $10o,ooo and take two years to com-
plete. But Greer's compassion for 36 Brownell St. is hardly that of 
a devoted architecruralist. For over a decade he has amassed ruined 
houses in his neighborhood, gutting and refurbishing them before 
renting them out. Greer presently controls a veritable empire of 30 
properties in the warren of residential streets between Edgewood 
Park and Whalley Avenue. 

Depending on whom you ask, Greer's real estate dominion has 
been a godsend, a curse, an enigma, or maybe all three. Since the 
project began, properry values in Edgewood have stabilized, 
crime-specifically prostitution and drug dealing-has decreased, 
and houses that once sat in ruin have received stylish makeovers. 
But charges of racism have been swirling around the enterprise ever 
since Greer challenged the ciry housing authority's placement of 
Gracie White, a black woman, in a house on his street. Some mem-
bers of the black communiry have branded Greer a separatist-an 
epithet they believe is aptly symbolized by the imposing, eight-foot 
fences that surround his properties. 

Greer is used to controversy. In 1997, he helped instigate and 
carry out the bitter and unsuccessful "Yale Five" lawsuit, in which 
four Orthodox undergraduates (the ftfth dropped out) sued Yale 
because the Universiry had not exempted them from mandatory 
on-campus housing, which they claimed forced them to break their 
interpretation ofJewish law by living in close proximity to members 
of the opposite sex. Greer's daughter Batsheva and family friend 
Elisha Hack were among the litigants. 

Through it all, Greer's renovation project has developed steadi-
ly. 

Construction crews are currently painting, hammering, and 
sawing away at fom sites, and several other properties, including 36 
Brownell St. and a three-story office building on Whalley Avenue, 
are on the waiting list for repairs. Greer openly boasts that he has 
established a "well-run housing authoriry" that no government 
agency could match. Whether his enterprise will better Edgewood, : 
however, is unclear. 

G REER FIRST CAME TO NEW HAVEN 41 YEARS AGO tO attend Yale 
Law School, where he roomed with future California gover-
nor and Presidential aspirant Jerry Brown. After a whirlwind tour 
of Wall Street, New York Mayor John Lindsay's administration (as 
Depury-Mayor for Ports and Terminals), and war-torn Israel, where 
Greer was ordained, he returned to New Haven in 1976 with his 
family and settled in Edgewood, a neighborhood with a burgeoning 
Jewish presence. Greer resisted the urge to _which so many New 
Haven Jews had succumbed: to move to the comfort of the ciry's 
outskirts. He chose instead to brave a harsh urban atmosphere, one 
historically plagued by poverry, drugs, and prostitution. 

Greer had grand hopes for Orthodox Judaism in Edgewood 
when he arrived. Disappointed with the local religious school offer-
ings, he founded his own school, called the Gan (Hebrew for "gar-
den"), in order to educate his children in accordance with his strict 
interpretation and observance of Jewish law. Greer's political skills 
and remarkable connections-he served on the city police commis-
sion and was close with then-Mayor Ben DiLieto-paid off. In 1982 
the ciry sold an Edgewood school to him-without a public bid-
for a paltry $35,000. Greer moved the Gan into the massive, red-
brick building (which required an eight-year, $1.5 million renova-
tion) and eventually renamed it the Yeshiva of New Haven. He 
became the rabbi of the Yeshiva shu!, or synagogue. 

But what of Greer's vision of Judaism? On the outside, Greer 
does not conform to the ultra-Orthodox stereotype of black hats 
and long coats, but he does seek a very radical inward orthodoxy. 
"There was a beautiful world," he told me, "a world of Eastern . 
Europe where there was the intensiry and seriousness and commit- . 
ment to Judaism which was lost ... We feel very strongly that to be : 
Jewish you have to be really Jewish ... We're trying to restore a 
world that no longer is." In the ominous-
ly-tided book jew vs. jew, which chronicles 
the "Yale Five" suit (and which sits on a 
shelf in Greer's office), Greer confirmed his 
highly intellectual and unusual conception 
of Judaism. He told the author Samuel 
Freedman, "We want to recall the world 
we've 
been cut off from 
by 
the 
Enlighten ment .... " 

But if the "Yale Five" incident is any 
indication, Greer's uncompromising devo-
tion seems to surpass even that of most 
Orthodox Jews. The suit sent shockwaves 
through the New Haven Jewish communi-
ty, alienating many who saw Greer's aggres-
siveness and· con-
' 
demnation ofYale as too extreme. th

as one example. 
An Orthodox Jew 
who sent his chil-
dren to the Gan school, Wilf moved five 
years ago from Edgewood .to Westville, a 
popular Orthodox neighborhood that is. 
He thinks that Greer has welcomed con-
tention in order to foster a stronger Jewish 
identity in his community. "It's a model of 
separation-a 19th century European 
model-in which individuals feel a need to 
separate and often polarize through the 
rejection of various things, like Yale, 
modernity, or liberalism," he told me. "It 
is most certainly not the model in New 
Haven." Many Jews, he thinks, have found 
Greer's struggles irrelevant, and so too his 
Edgewood community. 

S oon AFTER THE GAN MOVED, Greer 
says, it became evident that his 
school and synagogue, and with it his life 
in Edgewood, could not flourish if prosti-
tution, drug dealing, and other crimes per-
sisted. So he and a number of other con-
cerned neighbors resorted to some extreme, 
even brutal, measures. 
They began 
patrolling the neighborhood in their cars, 
hoping to spot prostitutes and their johns. 
Whenever they found a john, they would 
take photographs and coax the police to 
make an arrest. They also established the 
"John of the Week" program, in which they 
would hang up posters with the names and 
addresses of arrested men in their own sub-
urban neighborhoods. Evan Stark, a for-
mer Edgewood resident and ward co-chair, 
says that at one point Greer even hired a 
security company to watch the streets. 
Greer fiercely denies that allegation, but 
Alderwoman Elizabeth McCormack con-
firmed Stark's story. 

Soon afterwards, Greer began purchas-
ing houses, usually for between $2o,ooo 
and $8o,ooo. At first he bought up homes 
around the Gan School as dormitories. But 
soon he sec his sights on other parts of the 
neighborhood. When I asked Greer about 
his motivations, he pointed to the slum 
economy-a "bad system" that he says fos-
ters crime and instability in the real estate 
market. "We realized that ultimately if we 
didn't start doing something to the infra-
structure of the 
neighbor -
hood-namely 
the housing-
we 
weren't 
going to make a 
real dent," he 
says. While he tapped government funding 
programs 
like 
Neighborhood 
Assistance Act, Connecticut Housing 
Finance Authority, and city block grants-
ranking among the top individual recipi-
ents of all state money-he used his City 
Hall connections and tax and real estate 
law expertise to begin expanding his prop-
erty holdings. His deft use of several non-
profit corporations-Edgewood Village 
Inc., FOH Inc. (Friends of HaGan), 
Edgewood Corners Inc., Edgewood-Elm 
Housing, The Gan School, Barak Joseph 
Morand Zelinsky Memorial Fund, and 
Edgewood Properties-allowed him to 
raise even more funds and to bid on hous-
es more covertly. 

By the mid '9os, Greer's unique role as 
both real estate mogul and civic watchdog 
had become apparent. He and his "peoplen 
began planting and watering dozens of 
trees around the neighborhood and picking 
up trash on the streets and sidewalks. In 
2000, the year the New Haven R~gist(l' 
dubbed Greer the "Mayor of Edgewood,n 
he sued the owners of a house of prostitu· 
tion run by cwin brothers. After working 
with the police to put the two in jail, Greer 
ultimately took over the property, and now 
counts it among his many trophies. 

G reer is actually something of an aes-
. thete when it comes to the renova-
tion of his houses. Like an expert sales:. 
man, he brags about the detailed, elegant
