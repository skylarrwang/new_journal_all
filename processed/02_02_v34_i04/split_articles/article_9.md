**The Calling**

"I'VE WANTED TO BE A PRIEST 
since I was a Â·little kid," says 
junior 
Danielle Tumminio. 

Danielle realizes that this path is 
not an easy one: "There is a common 
perception that priests are weird." 

Organized religion is not central to 
Danielle's farriily, so she cani:IOt look to 
them for unconditional support. Initially, 
her parents tacitly opposed her possible 
career plans. In addition, as a woman she 
faces a special set of difficulties; the 
Episcopal Church offers little guidance for 
females who want to become priests. Most 
of all, she finds it difficult to reconcile her 
choices with those her peers are making 
around her. "The hardest thing for me 
about considering the priesthood at Yale is 
that I'm surrounded by so many goal-ori-
ented people who are going to go on to do 
amazing things in the world, like be politi-
cians, acuesses, well-known lawyers ... It's a 
real struggle to know that I'm never going 
to be rich or famous ... that my contribu-
tion 
will 
be at 
a 
quieter 
level." 

Nevertheless, her calling is "a pull, almost 
like being in love." 

Danielle is not the only student at Yale 
who has dreamed of this unusual vocation. 
Other students eloquently express the chal-
lenges and excitement they face when 
thinking 
about 
ordination. 
Though 
Danielle believes "this is a very spiritually-
oriented campus, in that people talk about 
religion a lot," she feels that students often 
look down on organized religion. As anoth-
er aspiring Episcopalian minister observes,

"Christianity gets the reputation of being a 
pep rally for God." A senior considering 
ordination as a Catholic priest notes, 

"Organized religion is outdated." Echoing 
this sentiment, Danielle does not "feel that 
my belief suucture has to fit the belief sys-
tem of my religious organization exactly." 

Students at Yale considering ordi-
nation are by no means 
Bible 
(or 
Torah) 
thumpers. They are 
questioners who rec-
ognize flaws 
m 
organized 
reli-
gion. 

Another 
senior consider-
ing the Catholic 
priesthood says, 
"It's a V{)cacion. I 
don't 
have 
choice about it. 
It's something I 
have ro discover. The 
idea of religious voca-
Shari Goldman Gottlieb 
cion must consume you. 
It can't be one among many 
choices. It must be that you can't see 
yourself as happy outside of religious life ... 
At the same time, people rarely think of 
ordinario.n as . a reasonable possibility for 
someone in the modern world, which can 
lead to feelings of separation from the rest 
of the world."
