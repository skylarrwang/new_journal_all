up with the sun. He might be mad, but he's 
also gentle. He goes by Ziggy. 

An Albanian Kosovar who fled Tito's 
Yugoslavia in 1969, Ziggy speaks English as 
if it were a Slavic tongue. The words are 
correct, but the pitches are foreign, rising 
to the tone of feverish laughter and seconds 
later falling to a hoarse, conspiratorial 
whisper. 

Ziggy tells me he's not an American 
citizen, and he claims to be barred from 
returning to his native land. Yet his aile~ 
giance is dear: Srars and stripes adorn his 
bandana, his tee-shirt, his jacket, his pants, 
and his shoes. I cannot vouch for his 
undergarments, but I'd guess the assump-
tion is safe. The only departure from the 
theme is a gold medallion around his neck, 
stamped with the Albanian double-eagle. "I 
wave this flag any place because this coun-
try is the greatest nation that I see," he 
declares, filling his lungs nearly ro bursting. 
"I can smell it in mine heart." 

Ziggy has devoted his life, he explains, 
to fighting Communists-a group that 
over the course of our conversation came to 
include not only Tito, but Mikhail 
Gorbachev, Slobodan Milosovic, Osama 
fEBRUARY 2002 
bin Laden, Jesse Jackson, the entire 
Chinese nation, and the members of the 
Connecticut Coalition for Peace. The CCP 
stands in silencre across the street, holding 
signs protesting the war in Mghanistan. 

Ziggy's main critique of all of them is that 
they are irreligious. "The Communists, 
they don't have any faith," he says. "And 
they are brainwashing our people right 
here." 

Ziggy's own beliefs owe more to poli-
tics than anything else. "The Turks invade 
my country," he says, "so I am a Muslim." 
He does not practice, however, since he is 
unwelcome at the local mosque. He helped 
found a mosque in Waterbury, he explains, 
laying the foundation stones himself, but 
"they chased me out because I disagreed 
with them." The conflict arose in 1983, 
when the Reagan administration bombed 
Beruit. "One man came in to pray in the 
mosque and he was saying, 'Brother 
Muslims, they are killing our boys in the. 
Lebanon' ... I stood up and I said, 'Listen, 
this mosque is built in the United States 
and we shall pray for this country and give 
thanks to America for allowing us to pray 
here.'" Ziggy waited for someone to second 
him, but no one did. 

Years later, Ziggy is still standing 
alone. Parents stop with their children 
for a moment to hear his story, and 
Ziggy loves to be a civics lesson. They 
continue on, just as countless sup-
porters in honking sws pass by once 
the light turns green. But Ziggy is here 
for good. "''m going to stay like this 
until I die," he states firmly. He Â·is a 
new and permanent feature of the 
landscape: an alien with a flag, a man 
without a church who is waging holy 
war.
