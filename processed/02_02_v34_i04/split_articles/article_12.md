'was holy for Jane. For me, it was just a 
weekend. 

Jane is not exactly sure why she is at 
Yale. "I'm here for a reason, that's all I 
know." Years ago a palmreader told her that 
she was destined for a life of travel and that 
she would meet many "strange, strange 
people." Taking these words as a message, 
Jane began "living life one day at a time." 
This eventually brought her to New 
Haven. 

When she was 14 Jane attended a 
religious camp in Finland. She 
lived in the woods and 
spent days reading, dis-
cussing, and embrac-
ing spirtuality. On 
the last day of 
camp 
she was 
confirmed. 
"It 
was so strange. 
While being con-
firmed, I couldn't 
understand a word 
the preacher was 
saying. It was like 
gibberish." 

Nevertheless, Jane went 
through the motions. 
Upon returning to the States, 
she immediately began looking for a 
church that was suitably "Finnish." She 
found one, and immediately rook commu-
nion. "To me, communion is one of the 
most beautiful and sacred partS of the 
Christian religion. I took it very seriously." 

During the ceremony, Jane remembers 
hearing laughter coming from the congre-
gation. "It blew me away. People were actu-
ally laughing and talking during commu-
nion. It disappointed me so much." She 
claims that it was this experience that 
changed her life. "I never thought I would 
stop being Christian, but I needed to 
reevaluate everything." Jane remembers a 
friend approaching her during this difficult 
time and posing the question that would 
ultimately help her find paganism. "My 
friend asked me, 'lf you could somehow 
control nature, if only in a small way, 
would you want to?'" Jane responded, 
"Yes." 

The church looked like a haunted 
house. Candles £lickered in the windows. 
Upon entering, we were immediately greet-
ed by the high-priestess and led to the 
kitchen, where a modest buffet had been 
laid out. Jane wandered off to meet the 
others. I kept my distance. After two lone-
ly years of worshipping alone in her dorm 
room, she was finally going to meet other 
pagans, and I did not want to fuck that up. 

The Priestess led me to the altar room. It 
was large and as cold as an icebox. 
Celtic music oozed from the 
walls. In the middle of the 
room, several people were 
assembling an altar. A 
wine-colored 
cloth 
was draped over a 
small table and held 
in place with gilded 
candle 
holders, 
flowers, wicker bas-
ketS, bowls, and a 
large white candle. 

People began trickling 
into the room. Groups 
of two or three formed in 
each corner. One woman 
talked about her mobile phone, a 
man told a story about his trip to Sweden, 
and a debate on the origins of paganism 
erupted in the nearby kitchen. As cime 
passed, the mood began to change. Dry 
conversations melted away, giving birth to 
a fantastical, collective energy. A man 
began to beat on an African drum. The 
thump-thump was infectious. Others 
grabbed drums and joined in. I was hand· 
ed a small djimbe. "Want to give it a cry?" 
I £licked the drum head softly at first. Then 
louder. Louder. Louder. Louder. The cele-
bration had begun. 

One mao slipped into gray legginS$t 
fastened a broadsword to his belt, and put 
on an olive tunic. The priestess wore a ster· 
ling head band. Jane put on a flowing black 
robe. One woman, called Sederis, wore 
jeans, a turtleneck, and white sneakers. 

People began removing their shoes and 
socks to facilitate "grounding." A man 
named John approached me. John was 
raised a Lutheran, defected, joined the

brotherhood of Islam, and then studied 
with an Onhodox rabbi. Now he was a 
pagan. "You should give this a try. It will be 
an experience." I kicked off my shoes and 
followed the others, taking a place in the 
back of the line that had formed just out-
side the altar room. There were probably 
twelve of us. Some held lanterns; others 
held songbooks in their hands. I could hear 
the priestess blessing the altar in the next 
room. offering water to the goddess of 
spring. 

Eventually the line began to move for-
ward. The priestess stood at the door. 
splashing devotees with scented water as 
she acceped their declarations of faith. 
When I approached her, the Priestess 
smiled. She poured water into my cupped 
hands. She touched my heart, then my 
forehead. and asked, "Do you accept the 
blessing of the goddess Breid?"' I was hesi-
tant. "Do I really have to do this? .. Her eyes 
relaxed. She nodded quiedy. I just stood 
there. Finally. I accepted and walked into 
the room. Once the Priestess had blessed 
the group. we formed a circle. We hdd 
hands-left palm down, right palm up-
and undulated as a group. like a sine wave. 
Our chant crescendoed-"The river she is 
flowing I Flowing and growing I The river 
she is flowing I Down to the sea." The man 
in the tunic walked around the room, hold-
ing his broadsword, shouting incantations. 
A man in a red cloak joined the Priestess by 
the altar. She clutched a black book bound 
in white ribbon, and read instructions. AU 
turned, saluting the four cardinal direc-
tions. Hands were raised in celebration. 

Meditation followed. We sat down 
cross-legged as the Priestess read from her 
book. I closed my eyes and listened. I was 
standing in a forest. Snow was f.Uling and it 
covered everything. Ice hung from the 
trees. The night was ominous and the road 
was nearly invisible. Suddenly, I carne to a 
dearing. There was a sparkling rock ledge. 
F1ames floated up a twisting path. I contin-
ued to walk forward. A hole appeared. 
maybe in the rock. maybe in a big tree. I 
couldn't tell. Inside the hole, I saw a light. 
Long flowing hair. The promise of green. I 
was &lling asleep. I was falling into a voice. 
I 
was heavy like granite. I was the ground, 
just like I was supposed to be. 

I woke up with a start. "New life .... " 

The priestess pronounced a reawakening. 
Now, the ceremony became intensely per-
sonal. One by one, we approached the 
altar. Like the others, I knelt, said a prayer 
for my f.unily, and placed a polished shell 
in a basket for the goddess. Some bowed 
low before the altar. Others prayed long 
and hard. Some cried. Everyone took a 
"healing cloth," a gift from the goddess to 
be used before the next full moon. I 
dripped hot wax into a flat saucer and 
stood my candle upright before returning 
to the circle. 

The man in the red cloak approached 
each person, handing them a cookie. "May 
you never hunger." All responded, "And 
may you never hunger." The priestess 
passed a chalice of ale clockwise from per-
son to person. "May you never grow 
thirsty." Most took long, almost sensual 
drinks ftom the cup. The ale smelled of 
raspberries. Some saluted the goddess as 
they drank, raising the cup as one would 
toast a young bride. A few prayed in 
silence. I was the last one to be offered a 
drink. I politely declined. The priestess 
seemed confused-maybe hurt-but I just 
could not do it. The magic of the night had 
worn off, and I was too aware that I was an 
outsider, not even half-pagan. Though 
intrigued, I was cold, exhausted, and con· 
fused. 

The journey ended there. Jane had 
found others. She had found a path that I 
was not willing to travel. Leaving the 
church, I stumbled into the street. The 
night was still surreal. Now, the extreme 
darkness and giant houses were comple-
mented by the lingering smell of a cold 
sanctuary and memories of a dream-like 
service. "Surrealism is not a bad thing." 
Jane's words sort of made sense now.
