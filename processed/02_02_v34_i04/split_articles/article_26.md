T IS A SIN TO WRITE THIS. It is a sin to think 
words no others think and to put them down 
upon a paper no others are to see." By invok-
ing the words of Equality 7-2521, the hero of Ayn 
Rand's Anthem, I hope to channel her energy, to 
feel the firm ground of rational egoism 
beneath my feet. My newfound belief in the 
guiding light· of self-interest will not last 
long, though. At the Objectivist Study 
Group at Yale (OSGAY) I might fin~ 
friends, but few Objectivist supporters. 
And all too soon, I myself will be depro-
grammed. 

The OSGAY meeting was small the 
night of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, the 
night my brief affair with objectivism 
bloomed and faded. Just seven of us sit-
ting around a seminar table, chatting before the me~ting officially 
began. "You want to run around putting up weird posters about 
Martin Luther King after this?" Lukas Halim asked the group. 
Little enthusiasm in response. 

The gathering slipped easily from casual banter to informal 
debate. At issue this week was the meaning of objectivity. Irina 
Manta, OSGAY's president, presented Ayn Rand's position: that 
truly objective reasoning demands the rational integration of all 
available knowledge about an object or situation. Based on the 
total information you have, you can reason objectively and deter-
mine that something is true, but you can still be wrong if you have 
any misinformation. "Object to that," she challenged, and we were 
off: nearly two hours of impenetrable talk about "stolen concepts" 
and "secret selves." Rand's ideas started the discussion, as they do 
each week, but soon everything became debatable, from the value 
of human life to the comparative merits of "dialogue" {which is "a 
wuss word," according to Lukas) and "dialectic" (clearly a more 
robust term). The quips and rebuttals came fast; if my mind wan-
dered for even a few seconds, I nearly lost track of the argument. 
Ostensibly, we were making progress on the issue, but it was hard 
to tell. 

My rapid disillusionment with Objectivism was not a rare 
reaction. "A lot of people come to the Objectivist Study Group 
and stop being Objectivists," explained former follower David 
Barnes. "When you actually sit down and analyze Rand's writing 
... you realize that a lot of her assumptions about human nature 
don't work out." Most Yale Objectivists alter their outlook quick-
ly. When new students come to OSGAY, the non-Objectivist major-
icy illuminates the shortcomings of Rand's philoso-
phy. "We try to deprogram Randians and half of 
them find the truth; the others just wander," 
explained Daniel Kornfield at the meeting. Lukas dis-
agreed. "We engage in a dialectic, and they depro-
gram themselves." 

Some newly disillusioned objectivists align them-
selves with other conservative ideologies. Others find 
guidance in the absolutism of organized religion-when 
rigid rationalism fails, they fall back on faith. osGAY 
meetings are a chance to debate abstract ideas with 
friends from the Party of the Right-libertarians, anar-
cho-capitalists, conservative Christians. Notably absent 
at OSGAY, however, are Conservative Party members, 
who frequent the rival Ayn Rand Society. That 
was founded in 2000 as a non-YPU 
............ ~ ·organization, but quickly came to be 
dominated by Yale Conservative Party members. Nearly absent at 
OSGAY, as well, are orthodox Objectivists. All but Irina are non-
believers. 

"If you believe that you've found the system that is true," Irina 
told me, "that's going to be more important than agreeing with 
people all the time." When Rand comes under attack in OSGAY, 
Irina explicates, rebuts, and defends. Her convictions run deep, 
but she takes nothing on faith. Irina discovered Rand's books at 
home in Swinerland. Her father became an Objectivist when she 
was ten. "We fled communist Romania. My parents had been 
indoctrinated [by the Party] their whole lives, but they knew 
something was wrong." For Irina and her father, Rand's philoso-
phy gave structure to the anti-collectivist sentiments they had 
always shared. "It really made sense. It already corresponded to 
things I had believed all along." Objectivism organizes Irina's life 
to some extent-she goes to the occasional conservative protest, 
and participated in the December "Walk for Capitalism" in New 
York-but on the whole, her ideology is private. It's not a religion, 
but a philosophy that runs as deep. On occasion she feels the iso-
lation of her belie&. "Sometimes there is this loneliness that can 
come into it," she admitted. "There's obviously few of us. It's kind 
of sad." 

Heading home after the meeting, I thought about Irina's sad-
ness, and that of her entire group. They were a lonely, motley band 
of rugged individualists, h uddled like survivors on a deserted 
island of conservatism in the sea of liberal ideologies that is Yale . 
Would their measured debates eventually succeed in bringing 
more eager minds into the fold? Objectively speaking, I doubt it.
