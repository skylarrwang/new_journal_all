**Title: The Last Crusade**
**Page number(s): 30**

I 
N 1998, CAMPus CRUSADE FOR CHRIST AT YALE faced an iden-
tity crisis. Marginalized from the university mainstream and 
almost exclusively Asian, the organization resorted to a radical mea-
sure: It changed its name to Yale Students for Christ (Ysc) and 
sought to diversify its membership and redefme its public image. 
The new YSC is almost twice the size of its previous incarnation and 
one of the most ethnically diverse groups at Yale. A short list of the 
local churches that YSC members attend is indicative of the change: 
Black Church at Yale, Calvary Baptist, the International Church at 
Yale, and Impact, among others. Yet despite its new name and 
composition, YSC remains a chapter of the international Campus 
Crusade for Christ. It sponsors the same activities, is supported by 
a paid Campus Crusade staff of six recent college graduates, and 
adheres to the same evangelist doctrine--<femanding that members 
share their faith and spread the gospel any chance they get. 
YSC meetings on Thursday nights unfold like any other meet-
ing on campus. A recent meeting sent the YSC staff scrambling to 
fetch extra chairs for the group of nearly 8o that arrived at the 
Dwight Hall common room. While four students set up a drum set 
and guitar at the front of the room, everyone else stood around talk-
ing to friends f.u past the 7 PM start time. At 7:25, someone finally 
came forward to begin the meeting with a short prayer. Next, a girl 
made the weekly announcements. The same girl might have spoken 
the same words at a sorority meeting. Don't forget the retreat, she 
reminded the group. Oh, yeah, and the great Panama Beach spring 
trip--hang out and enjoy evangelism, fellowship, and sun. 
Following acmouncements, chairs scraped the floor in the 
crowded room as everybody rose to sing. The song asked God for 
righteousness, holiness, and faithfulness, words that ace normally 
taboo on the Yale campus. The guest speaker that evening was 
Reverend Moody, the minister at local Trinity Church. Moody sug-
gested a theme verse for the semester-Philippians 4:9-a verse that 
speaks about the example that Christ sets in both his words and his 
actions. Bibles appeared from backpacks, sports bags, and purses as 
everyone followed along. Then the Yale Students for Christ left the 
room, the verse still in their minds, ready to do Christ's work in 
their lives and on campus. Moody's mild, socially aware, and posi-
tive speech exemplified the new kind of crusader that YSC hopes to 
encourage. 
This new crusader began to appear last year, when YSC joined 
with five other Christian groups at Yale to publicize their mission 
activities, including speakers and discussions. The theme of the 
week's activities was the question "Do you agree with Dave?" T-
shirts, spotted everywhere across campus, answered the question, 
saying, "I agree with Dave." The "Dave" featured on these shirts is 
Dave Farrell, an actual member of YSC, but his name was chosen 
because it is a common one, meant to represent the believer in gen-
eral. YSC members considered the effort a success, sparking more 
talk about Christianity than the campus had seen in years. Even 
negative responses were taken as a good sign, proof that students 
were at least thinking about religion. However, one sign that read "I 
agree with Dave" was changed to read "I agree with Dave Koresh,"
