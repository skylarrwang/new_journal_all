AT 
II AM ON SuNDAY, when the morning worship service is 
scheduled to begin, the pews at the First Calvary Baptist 
Church are only half full, and there are as many people fidgeting on 
the pulpit as there are in the congregation itself. A smaJI boy, no 
older than ten, sirs behind a sprawling drum ser, impatiently tap-
ping a cymbal. In front of him, another picks at a keyboard. Several 
men in dark suits lounge listlessly behind a podium, glancing occa-
sionally at gold watches or flashing subtle smiles ro members of the 
congregation. Then, the First Calvary Baptist Church explodes. 


A choir, made up of large women with thick glasses and tiny 
girls with cornrows, gyrates righteously onto the stage, flowing 
through three rows of chairs on the right while belting out a hymn, 
fists raised to the roof. The choir-master is a skinny man in a green 
swearer, and the Spirit apparently has him possessed; he flails and 
gesticulates wildly, echoing his choir with arnens and hallelujahs, 
eyes closed, knees bent, and face turned toward God. The key-
boardist pounds our gospel chords to the drum's swinging bear. 


The rest of the room, as if on cue, starts ro fill up and come 
alive. Leather soles tap on the linoleum floor. The congreganrs-all 
of them black--clap their hands and swing their hips, tentatively ar 
fuse, and shout out the occasional "Praised be the Lord!" Toddlers 
bounce on the church benches, teenagers shift and giggle, hunched-
over old men shake and sing. The music rises in waves of old-time 
religion, and as the opening hymn nears crescendo, the gangly 
choirmaster jigs on stage, stomping and spinning and jerking to the 
hoots and shouts of the congregation. There is no cross--or any 
other trace of Christianity, for that matter-behind him; instead, 
the scene is dominated by a sound console, the drumset, and two 
massive, pulsating speakers on either side. 


As the choir belts our "To God Be the Glory" in frantic repeti-
tion, a man in a black suit, black shirt, black tie, and gold-framed 
glasses rises and approaches the podium slowly and deliberately. He 
is not tall, but has the build of a linebacker-a thick neck and 
meaty hands which he periodically thrusts into the air. When he 
reaches the podium, he presides with quiet control. His left arm is 
still raised, the fist clenching and unclenching. He surveys his con-
gregation with a subversive grin, his &arne swinging and dipping co 
the music. And as the organ and the wails of the choir gradually die 
out, the Reverend Or. Boise Kimber begins to preach. 


Kimber has a perfect preaching voice, a low and raspy growl 
with a trace of a Southern accent. In the style of Martin Luther 
King, Jr., AI Sharpton, and Jesse Jackson, he seems co add an exrra 
syllable of emphasis to the end of every other word, affecting a 
cadence that builds slowly toward rapture. Bur the reverend's topic 
at the moment is not devotion or the Bible. He is riffing from the 
pulpit on politics-good, old-fashioned, lowdown-and-dirty poli-
tics.

OISÂ£ KIMBER IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE COMMUNITY 
leaders and political organizers in New Haven. The local 
press describes him as a "kingmaker," and Mayor John DeStefano 
counts him as a close friend and crucial ally. But these same qual-
