and numerous parody shirts appeared. While the members of YSC 
do not believe that one person can convert another (only the Holy 
Spirit can), they hoped that by sharing their beliefs they could 
expose more people to the gospel. But students' reactions to the "I 
agree with Dave" shirts demonstrated that Yale is clearly not the eas-
iest place to be vocal about Christian faith. 


Aaron Johanson became a Christian when he was four years 
old. He remembers kneeling down and asking Christ into his heart. 
Since then, part of his life has been mission work. Now a senior, he 
has participated in YSC since his freshman year at Yale. He has been 
on two missions, two of the four types that Campus Crusades spon-
sors: work in inner cities, resorts, beach communities, and missions 
abroad. In Yellowstone, one of the "resort" sites, Aaron's mission 
targeted park employees. The idea is that Yellowstone employees are 
often both rootless and looking for life direction. So ccc sends stu-
dents there to provide Christianity as an option. 


The next summer Aaron took on an even more challenging 
mission, one to East Asia. 
ccc calls this mission OEX-
Oriental Exchange. Because of the nature of the mission's 
work and the potential danger for those involved, each coun- "ON 
try is given a code name and participants are asked not to 
reveal the location. The level of sensitivity and the general 
region reveal Aaron's likely destination to have been China. 


ccc provides a week of training before students go abroad. 
During training Aaron was warned to avoid political issues, in 
particular the three Ts-Tibet, Taiwan, and Tiananmen. 


Aside from these warnings, Aaron gave little thought to the 
danger he might be in. Aaron said that he had gone to share 
an aspect of his life that is important to him. He said he would only 
talk to those who seemed interested in Christianity, and discussion 
of Christ made up only 40 percent of his conversations. When 
Aaron and other students who have done mission trips through ccc 
talk about "outreach," "sharing," and "community" work, no one 
ever mentions "proselytizing." 


But Aaron's mission work and the shirt he wears are compli-
cated. Is there a difference between standing on a soapbox and com-
ing into a community in order to "share?" Is there a difference 
between a shirt that says, "I agree with Dave" and one that reads 
"Why haven't you accepted Christ?" 


Leah Zimmerman became a Christian when she was 14. She 
joined YSC and Yale College Council as soon as she came to Yale and 
is a leader in both groups. Leah summed up her initial sense of the 
campus attitude as, "You're either atheist, Jewish, or stupid." As a 
Christian at Yale, she felt it was hard to "speak out." 


Leah's four years at Yale have revolved around speaking out. As 
president of Freshman College Council she sent out a mass email to 
the freshman class that included a citation from the Gospel with no 
words. Leah had made a typo--the numbers referred to a passage 
about the punishment of lustful sinners instead of the "more gener-
al happy message" about love she had intended. After a few officious 
email readers sent her angry replies, Leah sent out an apology to the 
list. Although unable to apologize for the scripture itself, which she 
embraces in its entirety, she apologized instead for any offense she 
might have caused. In the next issue of Rumpus she was compared 
to Hitler and Stalin. What that story didn't report was that after the 
exchange she received over 30 emails that supported her and spoke 
of the difficulty of being a Christian at Yale. For Leah the experi-
ence was encouraging, and since that time she has felt more and 
more accepted as a Christian here. Even so, Leah is the first to rec-
ognize the fundamental divide between herself and the Yale main-
stream. She focuses on the monetary and career goals of many stu-
dents and compares this with the Christian view: "We're saying that 
there is a sovereign authority that we live for." Even community ser-
vice is seen as ultimately self-interested from a Christian perspec-
tive. 


This February YSC begins another effort to spark spiritual dis-
cussion on campus in the weeks leading up to Easter, purchasing 
advertising space in campus newspapers and putting up a new set of 
signs to challenge the campus: "What if academics don't matter?" 
"What if there is a higher purpose in life?" 


YSC wants to be heard, but does it also want to listen? For Leah, 
the apparent conflict between her own strong beliefs and those of 
others can be resolved this way: "As much as you want something 
to be true, desire it to be true, this doesn't make it the truth. I 
believe that Jesus is the Son of God and that I am sinful and need 
Christ-but more than anything I value truth." Leah has found her 
truth through her faith in God, but she doesn't feel that this faith 
discredits someone else's. While YSC is making an attempt to reach 
out to the rest of campus, its challenge will be to convince a skepti-
cal student body that there is no paradox in Leah's belief.
