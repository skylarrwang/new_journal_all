EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
ly empty of churches for an old Puritan college, Yale looks like a 
Christian town from above. We have two great cathedrals: the 
library and the gym. Steeples rise above the dining halls and stained 
glass glints everywhere. 

But there is a danger in the Hollywood Gothic, specifically in 
the religious symbolism appliqued to the architecture that frames 
our college life. Yale should, at the very least, teach us the difference 
between the authentic and the winking knock-off, and nor all of its 
buildings do. We are taught by Rogers to value above all the picturesque, ro be aesthetes rather than historians or churchgoers. Bur 
all of this architecture originally meantÂ·something to the medieval 
Christians who invented it. Every statue and bit of colored glass 
told a story; every arch supported weight and every tracery was cut 
to let in light. What makes these features resonate so deeply remains 
a mystery, but the power that they have is real. A cross, blue and sil-
ver, the octagonal shape of a baptistery, and the sound of an echo in 
a sacred place--they all pull at us in a way that we cannot com-
pletely qualify. It is an imprecise science, and even pure Venetian 
Gothic had to borrow many of its decorative conceits and structur-
al principles from other traditions to have its effect. But while the 
best strains of religious architecture may be hybrids, at least their 
motive and object is pure: worship.

This tradition, in its glory and its folly, is obscured by Rogers. 
And it is not only in our century that this vocabulary has been 
twisted or used too liberally. New Haven's colonial churches are flat-
ceilinged and unornamented because Protestants believed that stat-
uary had ceased to teach and begun to be worshipped; for many, the 
cathedrals had become more attractive than the God. Perhaps the 
severe values of Old Yale are best discarded. But we still shouldn't be 
perfectly at ease in the calcified campus handed down to us, or 
allow the faux-Papist splendor to blind us so that we cannot even 
tell which building was originally used for worship. 

Too high up on Harkness Tower to make out from the street, 
James Gamble Rogers left statues of Euclid, Aristotle, and Homer 
to watch quietly over the campus. This was Rogers at his sentimen-
tal best, and it is a gesture that we can respect for its integrity and 
its symbolism. He was a good architect and a devoted son of Eli, but 
he erred in much of what he built. He lacked a respect for history 
and for the sacred-a respect that we should all fear to lose. This 
University was not built so that we can script cabaret revues of the 
classics, nor should it be itself the stage for such a show. At its best, 
its architecture is sublime. At its worst, it is a truth twisted 
grotesquely for our convenience, or for a picture-perfect view. We 
owe it to ourselves to learn the difference.
