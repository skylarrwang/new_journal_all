RTISTS BRADLEY McCALLUM AND }ACQU.EUNE 'TARRY are no 
strangers to controversy. Seated in their Brooklyn studio, 
Tarry remains pensive as she flips through their portfolio. "It's 
impossible to talk about our artwork without talking about it in the 
arc of public response and exchange," she says as she turns to 
McCallum, her husband and collaborator. "The work we do here," 
she says slowly as she looks across the loft, which rises above the 
blaring trucks of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, "can become 
irrelevant when the audience takes over." 

When Helen Kauder of A.rtSpace, a New Haven arcs center 
that showcases new works, invited McCallum and Tarry to partici-
pate in Citywide Open Studios in New Haven this past fall, no one 
foresaw how acute and overpowering the "arc of public response" 
would be. Commissioned to create an installation in the historic 
Center Church on the Green for the week-long arts festival, the 
husband-wife team was inspired by the church's recent apology for 
slaveholding among its members in the 18th and 19th centuries. 

Their resulting work Silmu is a series of 19 photographs of current 
members of Dixwell Avenue United Church of Christ-the first 
African-American church in New Haven. 

McCallum and Tarry's exhibit, intended to be displayed for 
one month, symbolically granted a long-overdue wish to Center 
Church's black congregants of centuries past, who had been restrict-
ed to the balcony. The sepia-tone photographs, enlarged to greater 
than life-size and mounted on posts, were scattered across the pews 
of Center Church's main sanctuary. Silmc~, with its images of 
Dixwell Church's present members bearing solemn faces and 
dressed in 18th century garb, stood in stark contrast to the church's 
sporless white walls. It clashed with the red carpet. And it was 
indeed powerful, perhaps more powerful than anyone expected. 

U 
NLIKE TliElR ART, McCallum and Tarry's studio is easily over-
looked. Their working and living quarters occupy the wp 
floor of a brick warehouse and are hidden among the wholesale 
markets of Brooklyn's Navy Yard. Entering the loft, one meets an 
array of their previous work-manholes, tombstones, call boxes--
as well as the pervasive smell of fish from the market one floor 
below. 

Together, McCallum and Tarry comprise ConjunctionA.rts, "a 
nonprofit artS organization that is dedicated to supporting. devel-
oping and presenting community-based art that fosters civic dia-
logue." Five years ago, McCallum, then a recent graduate of the Yale 
School of Fine Arts and an artist-in-residence with the American 
Civil Liberties Unjon, was inspired to create a work in response to 
New York's mounting concern with police btuta1ity. He solicited 
Tarry's help, and together the duo created Wit7Uss. Completed CWO

years after the ronure of Abner Louima in a Brooklyn precinct and 
two months after the fatal shooting of Amadou Oiallo in the Bronx, 
Witness consisted of 20 brick-red booths with telephones inside. 
The call boxes were located around the city where people died in 
confrontations with New York City police. When lifted, the 
receivers played testimonies of victims' encounters with police bru-
tality. 

When one of the call boxes was placed outside the United 
States Courthouse in downtown Manhattan, federal marshals, 
despite the city's explicit approval of the project, refused to allow it 
to remain. Spokespersons for former New York Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani referred to the project as "a disgrace." 

S 
ILENCE UNNERVED NEW HAVEN THE SAME WAY THAT Witness 
shook New York. In both cities, McCallum and Tarry's work 
was overshadowed by public response. And in both cities, the act 
provoked enough outrage to bring about its own demjse. 

Just one week after its opening, Silnzce was removed due to 
complaints by the congregation that its images blocked the view of 
the pulpit and were damaging the pews. So the story goes. However, 
in an interview with the New J1,rk Times, Reverend Shepherd 
Parsons at Center Church suggested that Silnzce did much more 
than block rhe view of the pulpit. "When I walked in and saw it, I 
gasped," Parsons stated. Whether because of its physical or symbol-
ic presence, Silence made people uncomfortable. 

The congregation's reaction, however, was nor disclosed to 
either AnSpace or the artists themselves. According to Kauder, 
"after the work had already been on display for two worship ser-
vices, and I inquired how the project was going, the heartfelt reply 
was: 'It's wonderful!' If there were other views of the project, they 
were kept silent until the abrupt about-face." The church moved 
rhe photos to the balcony. The audience of Silnzce had indeed taken 
over. 

Even to the artists, whose previous work has attracted national 
attention, New Havens reaction was unprecedented. "This was the 
first time," McCallum reflected as he looked through slides of their 
interrupted exhibit, "where the narrative and process of our work 
was decided by circumstances outside of our control. Never in our 
wildest dreams did we think that Center Church, who asked for our 
presence, would dismantle and remove the installation without con-
sulting us. Their choice has an irony that is hard to escape." 

When McCallum and Tarry discovered that Silnzce had been 
removed, they thought it only proper to participate in the discourse 
they had incited. They constructed tombstones out of plaster bear-
ing the names of those who left Center Church in the 1820s to form 
Dixwell Avenue United Church of Christ. The tombstones,
