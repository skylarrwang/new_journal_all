EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The 2001-2002 editorial board has chosen to focus its final issue on the theme of faith. We felt that questions of 
cardinal beliefs and the limits of objective knowledge, while seldom voiced, lurk in the background of everyday affairs. 

Of course, once we decided o n the theme, it started to pop up everywhere, from the President's State of the Union 
address to the exhortations of sidewalk preachers. 

Walking back from the train station a few weeks ago, I was stopped in my tracks by a poster in the window of a uni-
. form store: "Wear Your Faith ! Joyfully ... in a Murphy Choir Robe." As an intermittently disaffected Jew, I can only dream 
of a faith as comfortable and enveloping as a turquoise satin choir robe. It would allow me to blend in with an identi-
cal group of believers, while being perfectly sized to fit me. Some of our article subjects have already found that kind 
. of solace, whether in patriotism, paganism, evangelism, or Zen. 

But far more often, true belief means struggle. Unlike those robes, faith is hardly ever easily adjustable. Our panel 
participants, whether atheists or believers, were candid about their moments of personal crisis, when everything they 
thought they knew was called into question. Another shortcoming of a faith like a choir robe, for some, is that it stays 
inside the church; it isn't worn out in the street. The Orthodox rabbi in one of our features, and the Baptist preacher in 
Â· another, both hold religious tenets that demand strong involvement in the community. The public reaction to their pol-
itics and power plays may be mixed, but both men are convinced they have the Almighty's go-ahead. 

My last four years of working on The New journal have been truly inspiring. The devotion displayed, the impas-
sioned debates to define the core of our philosophy, and above a ll the dedication of t he mind, body, and soul to every 
activity of the magazine-writing, business, and design alike-combine elements of the monastic and fanatic. I con-
gratulate ev~ryone (especially Jessica Cohen and Matthew Underwood, who received first prize and honorable mention 
recognition in the Atlantic Monthly College Writing Competition) and wish the new editorial board a wonderful year to 
come.
