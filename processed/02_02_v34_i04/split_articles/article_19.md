ities have brought Kimber under suspicion. The New Haven 
AdvocatL" has labeled him a "bully," "favorite felon," and "neighbor-
hood patronage wheeler-dealer." He heads the Greater New Haven 
Clergy Association and has been intimately involved in city devel-
opment programs ranging from the Livable City Initiative (LCI) co 
the Hazel Street Development Corporation, a City Hall-sponsored 
nonprofit whose programs include homeownership promotion and 
job training. Last month, he was appointed Fire Commissioner. In 
a city where the clergy plays an unusually large role in politics and 
labor issues, Kimber is notorious for his charisma and effectiveness. 
Yet over the past five years IGmber's name has been regularly asso-
ciated with public scandal and government corruption. In 1998, he 
came under suspicion of embezzling city funds. In 1996, the rev-
erend was convicted of stealing over $4,000 of an elderly woman's 
burial money while running a funeral home owned by a jailed 
friend. 

The First Calvary Baptist Church is just one of dozens of 
churches on Dixwell Avenue which has made an abandoned store-
front ics home. The brick building where the church now resides 
housed a restaurant, a cleaners, and an insurance agency before First 
Calvary took over. It is located in the heart ofNewhallville, a neigh-
borhood just a few miles up Dixwell from Yale University. 
Newhallville--as Kimber never hesitates to point out-has consis-
tently ranked as one of the poorest communities in the state and, at 
times, in the nation. 

I am waiting to meet the reverend at First Calvary on a Sunday 
afternoon. Kimber pulls up co his church in a sleek silver Lincoln 
Continental and steps out in a black trench coat and black fedora. 
He shakes my hand and leads me to his office, a small room just off 
the main hall with buzzing fluorescent lights. The walls are covered 
in photographs-Kimber shaking hands with N Sharpcon, hud-
dling with David Dinkins and Jesse Jackson, standing next to 
Marion Barry. To the right of the large desk that dominates the 
room, there is a painting of Marcin Luther King, Jr .. Directly 
behind the desk hangs a painting of Kimber himself--one in which 
the Newhallville reverend bears a striking resemblance to the leader 
of the civil rights movement, whom Kimber compulsively cites as 
his role model. 


After growing up in Alabama and 
attending seminary in Ohio, Kimber 
arrived in New Haven almost 20 years ago. 
"I carne into the ministry not knowing that 
it would lead me into being this involved in 
the process of liberating people and orga-
nizing people," Kimber tells me. But from 
the moment he arrived in New Haven to 
minister at the Pitts Chapel Unified Free 
Will Baptist Church, the Reverend found 
political involvement unavoidable. "The 
black church," he explains, "is the largest 
institution that black folks have." Kimber 
leans back in his chair and clasps his hands 
together, talking with the certainty and 
vision of a good politician. "Some people 
ask, 'Why is the church involved in poli-
tics?' Well, someone has to be a voice to try 
to liberate people and try to help those who 
are disenfranchised. If we ever really get 
organized, we will suddenly become a force 
within the political arena." Most observers, 
however, quickly point out that that has 
already happened. Kimber's clergy associa-
tion, a primarily black organization, mobi-
lizes huge numbers of minoriryvot-
ers in election years, demand-
ing attention 
from local 
politicians. As one New 
Haven mmtster said, Kimber and his 
cohorts are "all about getting pastors 
together and organizing huge press confer-
ences." Union-affiliated ministers like 
Lillian Daniel and Scott Marks present a 
different leadership model. Heading orga-
nizations like Elm Ciry Congregations 
Organized and the Connecticut Center for 
a New Economy, these ministers are pivotal 
to the union organizing effort that is cul-
minating in the acrimonious labor negotia-
tions currently under way with Yale. As one 
labor organizer cold me, "The church is the 
. 
" 
umon. 

Kimber's nororiery as a reader has 
stemmed from his close, and at times con-
troversial, relationship with DeStefano. 
The reverend, of course, attributes his asso-
ciation with the Mayor to the benefits that 
DeStefano has brought to New Haven. "I 
think he is one of the better administrators 
this ciry has ever had," Kimber says. "He's 
included people in the process. Regardless 
of what people have said, this mayor has 
been real. inclusive." Kimber, however, also 
tends to downplay his connection with 
DeStefano, painti"ng himself as a political 
maverick out for nobody other than the 
people in his comrp.uniry. "I don't work for 
Ciry Hall. I don't work for the 
state 
of 
Connecticut," 
Kimber emphasizes. He 
takes aim at ciry government, 
Yale, the unions-anyone, it 
seems, who doesn't play according 
to his rules. With only a little 
prompting, he says. "Yale has to do more 
chan say that it wants a relationship. You 
show a relationship by love, by caring, by 
your gifts ... The union must contribute 
back to this communiry also. They have an 
obligation that they can't ignore either." 
Kimber, of course, sees it as his personal 
responsibiliry to ensure that they meet 
these obligations. 

SOON 
AFTER 
THE 
REVEREND'S 
Sunday morning preaching begins, 
he spots me sitting in the back row of his 
church and calls out ro "the strange-look-
ing boy in the back." Just to show who is in 
charge, he asks me ro stand and interro-
gates me about my purpose--knowing full 
well why I am there and what I am doing. 
He wears a slightly sadistic smile. "This 
article--it gonna be good?" he asks, elicit-
ing a wave of laughter from the congrega-
tion. '"Cause if it ain't, I'll sic 'em on you 
right now." He pauses, then bellows, "Can 
I get a witness?!" The congregation 
responds with a jubilant chorus of amens. 
"You can't hide from the press," he says, 
"But at least I got him at church." 

Kimber's pulpit polemic jumps from 
the state budget to Laura Bush to Governor 
John Rowland as the congregation shouts 
irs approval. He refers to recent articles 
from the New Haven Register and beseeches 
his congregation, singling out certain con-
gregants by name, to "empower" them-
selves. As he continues, he flashes a smile in 
my direction and, ever media-savvy, adds, 
"And don't think I'm just talking about chis 
because there's a reporter here." 

In the reverend's rhetoric, power strug-
gles take on the tone of a crusade, and 
political opponents are cast as doomed infi-
dels. The diplomatic reserve he shows in an 
interview is replaced by hellfire and brim-
.stone. "I met with [State Representative] 
Bill Dyson, and I told him we need two 
million dollars, and it's gonna happen," he 
thunders, fist in the air. "And I'm gonna sit 
down with Bruce Alexander and Michael 
Morand at Yale, and I'm gonna ask Yale to 
give one million dollars a year for the next 
ten years to the New Haven public school 
system. Yale's sitting over there and I'm 
talking about money, not people coming 
out here to help us." He sneers this last bit, 
prompting nods and grunts of agreement 
among his congregants, many of whom 
work in low-end service jobs at the 
University and whose kids attend failing 
urban public schools. Kimber corltinues. 
"And I told [lead union organizers] Andrea 
Cole and Bobby Proto that I want them co 
give $10o,ooo to the New Haven Board of 
Education. The union dues are going to 
have to scan corning out here to help us." 
By this point, Kimber is yelling. The 
tirade whips his parishioners into a frenzy 
of righteous empowerment and liberation. 
The reverend laughs, then raises his hand 
in the air to quiet the congregation. 
"Everyone calm down," he pleads sarcasti-
cally, smiling. "You know we got guests in 
the house." With this jab at the outsider 
among them, the congregants are suddenly . 
back on their feet, shouting and stomping. 
THE NEW JouRNAL 


Kimber is shaking with laughter. "Y'all 
know that we know how to act sophisticat-
~d. " With that, the organ starts again. "I let 
the Lord know: I love the Lord," he pro-
claims, looking my way. "I hope y'all write 
that into your newspaper." 

SEVERAL SCANDALS HAVE PLAGUED 
the reverend since he first became 
involved in the Livable City Initiative (LCI), 
a city office which promotes community 
development, in 1995Â· On an almost yearly 
basis, he had been charged with overseeing 
the funneling of city money to his friends, 
cheating contractors, and ignoring calls to 
give up his role in LCI and the Hazel Street 
influence is proof enough of his integrity. 
"If people really thought that I dealt in 
shady deals, I would never get calls from 
the Attorney General, from state represen-
tatives, from aldermen, from community 
people," he says. 

Controversy is inherent in the kind of 
politics Kimber practices. DeStefano looks 
to him for a solid block of Newhallville 
votes in every election, and the reverend 
delivers. He uses old fashioned tactics-
vote-pulling, patronage politics, turf 
wars-that inevitably draw heavy criticism 
in election years. Kimber defends his strat-
egy as one of simply maintaining strong 
relationships in the community that pay off 
when political battles heat up. "People have

1996 felony conviction, which elicited a 
pledge from DeStefano to remove Kimber 
from all city programs. But after resigning 
as head of the Hazel Street Corp., Kimber 
simply tapped his father-in-law for the job 
and stayed on as a special consultant at a 
salary of over $5o,ooo a year. 

Those allegations are only the start of 
a laundry list of shady fmancial dealings to 
which Kimber's name is linked. Still, 
DeStefano does not hesitate to affirm his 
own friendship with and allegiance to 
Kimber. And Henry Fernandez, who head-
ed up LCI at the time of Kimber's suspicious 
activities, has defended Kimber, while 
simultaneously shutting him out of all fur-
ther financial dealings. Kimber himself has 
heard it all before, and denies charges that 
he has personally benefited from his 
involvement in city development pro-
grams. "I haven't gained anything financial-
ly for myself or my family," he claims. "I've 
been able to help a community grow by 
developing new houses, helping to bring 
new ideas to a community, helping to build 
schools, helping to stop people from selling 
drugs on street corners. People will always 
assume ~at you're benefiting." But on a 
more basic level, Kimber simply sees no 
need to engage his critics--his continued

ple." Kimber has proclaimed himself a 
kingmaker in the past, and the label has 
stuck. But Kimber laughs and shakes his 
head when I ask him about the moniker. "I 
don't want to be remembered as a king-
maker ... I want to be recognized as a per-
son who has tried to make things better for 
people in general. If that means being a 
kingmaker by putting people in power who 
are on the right side of justice, then so be 
it." 

KIMBER'S 
SuNDAY 
MORNING 
performance shows a side of New 
Haven politics that cannot be replaced by 
virtuous bureaucratic reformers. No mem-
ber of the congregation is spared his atten-
tion; he refers to many by name. Afrer 
prayer recitations and responsive read-
ings--<>ne of the few quiet stretches in the 
service-the reverend steps up to the podi-
um with a pile of papers in hand. 
"Parents," he scolds. "There're still a lot of 
you who have not yet sent me your report 
cards." This is a ritual Kimber undertakes 
every time a marking period ends in the 
New Haven public school system. If things 
are not going well with one of his church's 
children, Kimber will not hesitate to step
