"Jp A MAN UES WITH A MAN as one lies with 
a woman, both of them h;tve done what is 
detestable" 
(Leviticus 
20:13). While teaching a 
course 
on 
the 
Old 
Testament at the Yale 
Divinity School {ms) last 
semester, Professor John 
Collins quoted this pas-
sage from the book of 
Leviticus. He explained 
that, in its literal sense, it 
appeared 
to 
prohibit 
homosexual behavior only 
between men. "As soon as 
I said this, a woman at the 
back of the class let out a 
loud sigh of relief," he 
recounts. The whole class 
broke into laughter. The incident has 
become a legend on campus. By some 
accounts, the laughter lasted for as long as 
20 minutes, revealing the high level of ner-
vousness surrounding homosexuality and 
religion-a hot topic at the Yale Divinity 
School. 

For almost two decades, YDS has stood 
with only a handful of other theological 
schools in welcoming and accepting homo-
sexual students. Unlike most schools that 
train Christian ministers, YDS is non-
denominational. According to Professor 
David Kelsey, this helps the school accept 
homosexuality. "It does make a difference 
[that Yale is] not beholden to a particular 
denomination which has issues with the 
ordination of gay people," he says. "Since 
we're not accountable in those ways, we're 
spared that sort of outside pressure." The 
Gay, Lesbian, Suaight, Bisexual Coalition 
was established in 1985, and YDS has sup-
ported it financially since its inception. 

According to students, YDS is known for 
both welcoming and enrolling more homo-
sexual students than any other divinity 
school. The Coalition's leaders, Sharon 
Fennema and Stephen Gould, say their 
organization boasts a mailing list of 55 stu-
dents and that anywhere from "five to 8o" 
attend Coalition events. 

Despite the ms's inclusive aims, its 
tolerance may be one-sided, argues first-
year Master of Arts and Religion student 
and self-described "conservative evangeli-
cal" Elizabeth Zagatta. "More conservative 
perspectives sometimes don't come out 
because people are afraid of backlash," she 
says. "Opinions have to be respected in 
both directions." However, Zagatta insisted 
that exposure to differ-
ent religious views has 
helped her explore and 
suengthen her faith. 

Such 
exposure 
grounds the decision 
of many aspiring min-
isters to attend YDS 
instead of denomina-
tional 
seminaries, 
where students focus 
on the teachings of 
their 
own 
church 
rather than broader 
ecumenical thought. 

religious 
diversity and openness 
are products of a century's worth of change. 
Founded in 1822, YDS no longer consists 
solely of "mainline Protestants" uaining for 
THE NEw JouRNAL 

the mmistry, according to Professor 
Emeritus Harry Adams. Today, students of 
Episcopalian, Roman Catholic, Baptist, 
and even atheist backgrounds study side-
by-side. In addition to the three-year min-
istry-focused Masters of Divinity (Morv) 
degree, YDS also offers a two-year Masters 
of Arts in Religion (MAR) degree for stu-
dents bound for the academy. 

Inter-denominational controversy is 
not confined to issues of homosexuality. 
The school's academic approach also sepa-
rates it from denominational seminaries. 
Instead of treating religious documents as 
the inspired word of God, many YDS pro-
fessors, including Collins, approach reli-
gious texts as historical documents. 

Operating under the assumption that 
humans authored these texts, they search 
for linguistic and anthropological clues to 
the texts' origins and their intended social 
purposes. According to Harvard Divinity 
School Professor Peter Machinist, many 
critics claim such study "cheapens the word 
of God." Some denominations even view 
such academic methods as 
heretical. For these reasons, 
conservative Christian denomi-
nations 
discourage 
prospective 
ministers 
from 
attending YDS and its peer insti-
tutions at the University of 
Chicago and Harvard, the only 
two other university-affiliated, 
non-denominational divinity 
schools. 

Among these "heretical" 
institutions, however, Yale stands 
alone in its ability to nurture the faith 
of its students because it remains, above all 
else, a Christian school. While its peers 
employ professors of Judaism, Islam, and 
Eastern religions, all YDS professors are 
Christian. According to Guy Martin, 
Associate 
Dean 
of Admissions and 
Financial Aid at YDS, this provides the 
school's community with a "common lan-
guage" for discussing theological issues. 

While conservative evangelicals and mem-
bers of the more-liberal United Church of 
Christ debate the ordination of homosexu-
al ministers, Muslims and Christians do 
not even share a common authoritative text 
on which to base theological discussion. 

According to YDS Dean Rebecca 
Chopp, Yale's peers are often seen as "really 
big religious srudies programs," while Yale 
FEBRUARY 2002 
remains a leader in purely Christian theol-
ogy. The Methodist Church, for example, 
allows its members to pursue ministerial 
studies at Yale but not at Harvard. Despite 
its reputation for being a liberal divinity 
school, Chopp said that Yale retains a 
strong tradition of evangelical participation 
because "Yale is not a place where one loses 
their faith." 

Indeed, GLSB Coalition co-coordinator 
Fennema said it was not Yale's openness but 
rather its commitment to her lifestyle that 
was the deciding factor in her decision to 
attend: "I felt like Yale was one of the few 
places where I could actually believe in 
God."
