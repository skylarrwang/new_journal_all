A MILE FROM STILL-SLEEPING downtown 
New Haven, three blocks past Ingalls Rink, 
and through the back door of a three-story 
blue Victorian, the 
New 
Haven 
Zen 
Center is the tranquil 
meditation room run 
by the Kwam Urn 
School of Zen. The 
room is dedicated to 
all New Haveners, 
residents and nonres-
idents alike, who seek 
tranquility at the 
beginning of an other-
wise exhausting day. 
The central question of 
Kwam Urn, according to resi-
dent Zen Master Seung Sahn, is one of 
inrrospective simplicity and profundity: 
"What are you?" 

The worshippers here are a calm, col-
orful group. From Nic Deschense, a Yale 
junior from Canada and forward on the 
varsity hockey team who lives at the center, 
to Camilla Atwood, a middle-aged postal 
worker who describes herself as utterly 
addicted to the free meditation, these peo-
ple are dedicated to the art of Zen. 

Arwood, sitting cross-legged on a soft azure 
pillow and surrounded by eleven other 
parrons aligned in rows, says she is a devout 
Christian but finds solace in connecting 
with her true meditative self. She admits 
her ignorance of Buddhist docrrine and 
likens her meditation to a sort of inner 
therapy. Membership in the Kwam Um 
School, a Korean Buddhism-based umbrel-
la organization with centers throughout the 
world, runs at $360 a year, but the casual 
walk-in like Atwood can pay nothing at all 
and still get a better sense of self-not to 
mention a soothing cup of tea. 

The day commences with an elaborate 
chanting ceremony. Korean words of 
prayer bounce off the pale walls and low 
ceilings, filling the room. Next comes med-
itation. For 30 straight minutes the room 
and its inhabitants sit perfectly still, five 
men and seven women contemplating 
nothing at all. 

Camilla describes her 30 minutes as a 
departure from the stresses of the day. 
During her moments of contemplation she 
centers her mind on the image of a crystal-
clear lake. She has attended a dozen Zen 
sessions since September n; she says she 
connects with God through prayer but can 
only learn about herself through medita-
tion. She talks easily about Seung Sahn, the 
guru ofKwam Urn in the Northeast, a pro-
lific writer, and Dae Soen Sa Nim (Great 
Honored Zen Teacher). Her reverence for 
the Center is refreshingly genuine. 

As meditation winds down, the group 
chats and sips green tea. Jobs, concerns, 
errands, and tensions may litter too much 
of the remaining day, but for a few 
moments at the center, the world sits still. 


**Rites of Spring**

JANE (NOT HER REAL NAME) and I had been 
walking for a half-hour. We talked a little, 
mostly about reincarnation and dreams. 
Jane was convinced she had lived other 
lives. I was not so sure, but offered my own 
thoughts-"The night seems unusually 
dark. These houses are so big. Like a dream 
.... " Jane answered, "You know, surrealism 
is not a bad thing." We were walking up 
Whimey Avenue, looking for a Unitarian 
church Jane had read about. The day was 
lmbolc, the pagan holiday dedicated to the 
"roots of spring" and the "lengthening of 
days." Jane cradled a wreath of flowers. I 
wore a backpack. The contrast between our 
appearances-her black dress and penta-
gram necklace, my boring sweater and 
jeans-made me uncomfortable. The night
