ou MAY NOT KNOW IT, but you are living in America's first 
Jl :heme park. The tall Gothic buildings arching over you, the 
quatrefoil traceries cut into their battlements, the leaded glass and 
coats of arms-all smoke and mirrors. Look around Branford's 
Great Courryard, and what do you see? A four-man touch f~otball 
game on the lawn; a couple of naked beeches; an old elm letting her 
smaller branches hang down like hair. And Oxford, or maybe 
Cambridge, in the background. Five stone towers rise above you, 
right out of a storybook. 

But come a little higher, and look again. That beautiful English 
slate roof isn't made of slate at all-bloody nicks in the shingles 
reveal red day hiding beneath the gray-green stain. W'rexham 
Tower, on the 
•of the quad, looks a little out of place: Its 
-
sryle and scale don't quite match. This makes sense, though, because 
the architect, James Gamble Rogers, plucked the design out of a 
tiny photograph of St. Giles Church in Wales, which just happens 
to look out over the graveyard where Elihu Yale is buried. In 
Branford's tower, a water tank used to be hidden where the bells 
were hung in the Welsh original. Now the facade conceals ventila-
tion systems; from above you can see the steel vents spinning. 

Rogers does not rank as an important enough architect to have 
had a book written about him, or even an entry in a standard ency-
clopedia of American architecture. He knew Frank Uoyd Wright 
and Louis Sullivan, and he apprenticed at one of the firms that first 
raised modern skyscrapers over Chicago. But Rogers found success 
as a sentimental architect, working fluently and happily in old ver-
naculars, dressing up practical plans and modern building tech-
~iques in Georgian or Gothic skins. His work at Yale has a timeless 
qualiry in part because the buildings are not really written in the 
architectural language of any one period: Renaissance flourish 
sneaks into the medieval doorways and arches at almost every turn 
in Branford, and a subtle fusion of sryles is visible in the seven other 
colleges he built as well. Rogers was more concerned with his 
buildings' impact than any ideology. Besides, a foreign element 
can.sometimes make a thing look more like itself; it can bring 
out the full flavor, like salt on food. 

Now ook around Yale and point to the churches. From 
Harkness, you can see the three on the Green, as well as 
the steeple of St. Mary's, and you might catch Battell 
Chapel wedged into the corner of Old Campus, peeking 
out like an afterthought between Farnham and Durfee. And 
there's Dwight Hall, where occasional services and weddings

its pinnacles and vaulting chapel hall, it was not built for 
worship--it was the library. Up Science Hill and out of
