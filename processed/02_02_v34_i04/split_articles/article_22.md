The Participants: 
Jon Butler, the chair ofYale's History 
Department, is co-director of the 
Institute for the Advanced Study of 
Religion at Yale. 
Gabriela Karabelnik, a senior in 
Calhoun College, was raised in a "cul-
turally Jewish" family, but became a 
Christian at the age of 28. At Yale she 
belongs to an Orthodox Presbyterian 
church. She is engaged to be married in 
June 2002; her fianc√© is studying to be 
a pastor. 
Stephen Kobasa, a 1972 graduate of the 
Yale Graduate School of Arts and 
Sciences with a degree in religious studies, 
is a member of the Connecticut 
Coalition for Peace and a parishioner of 
St. Thomas More Catholic Church. 
Ethan Guillen, a senior in Berkeley 
College, grew up with a Mexican 
Catholic father and an evangelical 
Christian mother. He adopted evangelical 
Christianity in high school. He 
now describes himself as an atheist. 
Abhimanyu Sud, a junior in Timothy 
Dwight College, was raised in a secular 
Hindu environment. He describes him-
self as a humanist. 

The following conversation took place Sunday, January 27, 2002. 
TNJ: What role does religion, or do religious people, play in the Yale 
experience, and how does Yale affect the religious experiences of its stu-
dents and faculty? 
Karabelnik: I think Yale has brought me to a greater understand-
ing of my faith ... I came in looking for Christian fellowship and 
engagement ... and I was very stimulated by people that I saw liv-
ing out their faith. 

Sud: I haven't experienced that at all. I think that for the most part 
there is an assumption of atheism, especially in the academic con-
text. There isn't any possibility of a debate on any consideration of 
faith. 

Kobasa: "When I was here the idea that someone would be publicly 
religious was at best a curiosity. Though there were at the time his-
torical images of political radicalism that were religious like [former 
Yale chaplain] Reverend William Sloane Coffin who was extraordi-
narily powerful not just within the local community but nationally. 
There was a sense that there was a community of faith that was 
combative in the highest moral sense with regard to that time, 
which was the time of the civil rights movement and Vietnam. 
Those were voices that were sought out here and honored in some 
degree, not that that was a universal acceptance. And I suppose I 
was touched by that. 

Butler: I don't think [religion] does have an impact here. My own 
view is, if you mean personal commitment, I don't think it plays out 
in any particular way ... I'm chair of the [history] department, and 
I have no idea of the religious persuasions of four-fifths of my col-
leagues. And I only know about the others by accident. 

Kobasa: So no one would deliberately ask another member of the 
faculty about their faith? 

Butler: I think that would be regarded as inappropriate. 

Karabelnik: I think what Professor Butler is talking about is large-
ly also a factor of how subjectivized religion has become. It's a mat-
ter of personal faith. And I really came into Yale wanting to see if 
there was another way of approaching it. If I'm in a New Testament 
class and there's someone telling me, "Well, see, these texts aren't 
reliable, look at these lies here, look at this," I wanted to allow it to 
be a threat to my faith, and I think that's where the most fruitful 
engagement has come. 

But I think generally in the religious studies department that's 
not the way it's presented. "Your personal faith is a matter for your 
personal life ... faith can be bracketed in your intellectual pursuits." 

Guillen: I'm just trying to flesh out what you were saying, 
Gabriela. I remember as a Christian freshman year, coming from 
the California tradition of Christianity where you have the belief 
that everything in the Bible is true. It's infallible. And I remember 
taking a class with Ivan Marcus where so much of the Bible is chal-
lenged. That certainly, to most people, provides a big challenge to 
personal faith if they're willing to engage in those terms. And I have 
to say . . . one thing that was very influential to me was that it 
seemed dispassionate. It didn't seem as though he had any sort of 
bent, that he was trying to convert Christians to atheism or any-
thing like that. 

Karabelnik: I guess that's where I'd be more in line with the post-
modern view that no approach is neutral. 

TNJ: What about the question of tolerance--what do you do when your 
views come into conflict with others? 

Guillen: I have a lot of trouble with fundamentalists, especially 
when they're involved in politics ... As long as others are willing to 
accept my beliefs, it's not too much of a problem for me. 

Karabelnik: A lot of the issues that you're raising are very interest-
ing to me, because I guess in your terms I would be the funda-
mentalist of the group ... The issue of tolerance is one that I some-
times experience as a threat, because I think it can be used against 
people like me who believe in religious absolutes. Tolerance can 
become an issue where it's fine for you to believe what you believe 
as long as you don't believe that what you believe is the truth. 

Guillen: I have no trouble with you. You're not crusading to con-
vert me. 

Butler: It is important to remember that tolerance, even as a his-
torical minimum, has been most useful. It's taken the edge off the 
other way, which is open oppression, oppression without any guilt, 
oppression without any qualification. And until the 18th century 
that's largely the position that most of Western culture took. 

Sud: I understand tolerance as a very active process, which implies 
a very different understanding of a relationship--not having the 
relationship depend upon beliefs. I take great pride in being able to 
disagree with someone fundamentally and not have it interfere at all 
with the assumption of unity between people. 

Kobasa: I think Christianity was better off when it wasn't tolerat-
ed. When it was a dangerous thing to be Christian, people's deci-
sions about that, over and against the threat of the state, had a very 
different, I think, implication ... You know, after September 11, for 
example, anyone who would have suggested [from a religious point 
of view] that we should not respond with violence to ... the attack 
on the World Trade Center would have been looked on as a betray-
er of what was essential about American patriotism. You were either 
with us or you were against us. Where does religion stand on that? 
And maybe it was true that that was the choice. Though there 
weren't many who cared to make it. 

So I think for myself maybe, the place where my own faith falls 
short is that I haven't had the experience of that kind of risk that 
really defines faith, where you have to put yourself on the line. 

TNJ: Can other people talk about moments of a personal crisis in faith, 
putting yourself on the line? 

Guillen: Well, for me, that was, I guess, fall semester sophomore 
year, or even during Christmas break. I was following the intellec-
tual pursuit of God. I guess I started out first with Christianity and 
Bible matters--does the Bible hold truth? Is it historically accurate? 
And if it's not, does it matter at all? And that was a very dark and 
hard time, where I was sort of losing the grounding that I had. Even 
the Catholicism I had, which was my background--Mexican-
Catholic. 

And so my exploration and studying of the Bible, in a more 
dispassionate way ... brought me to a place where I felt like I could-
n't believe Christianity anymore. And from that followed a more 
philosophical search after God. Even lacking any sort of intellectu-
al grounding, was there any reason just to have faith in God? Had 
I ever had any sort of faith experience of God, where I felt the pres-
ence of God, or something supernatural that would make me think 
there was a God? And I came to the decision that I hadn't ... I had 
always grounded [my faith] in a hope that there was some sort of
