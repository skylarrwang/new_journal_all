intellectual explanation for what was going 
on in the world, in God and in the Bible. 
And so it took a long time to emerge from 
that, to build up a new philosophy of life 
and regain purpose. And I guess in some 
ways I still battle with that, how to build a 
basis for morality and a sense of what's to 
come. 

TN]: Can you talk a little more about the 
process? Did you read, did you pray, did you 
stay up at night, talk to your friends, your 
family? 

Guillen: About all of those things, yeah. I 
started off just reading the Bible again, just 
cover to cover, everything . . . I actually 
emailed professors just asking them if they 
believed in God and why. I got some inter-
esting answers. Bur nothing that was 
incredibly satisfying. A lot of them were 
things like, "Well, I just never thought 
about the possibility that there wasn't a 
God." So that wasn't incredibly helpful. 
And so I talked to grad students. I read 
grad students' theses that they had written. 
There were many nights where I just didn't 
sleep. I was deeply depressed. 

Karabelnik: I also went through a period 
of depression and a lot of doubt. ActuaUy 
the first semester freshman year, right when 
I got here. I just really descended into a 
vicious cycle of self-hatred, self-deprecating 
thoughts, and that affected my faith ... I 
thought, "Well, I don't feel God. I don't 
feel like a Christian. I don't feel like I'm 
worthy of God's love." All those things, just 
very self-.directed. 

And it got so bad that I went home. I 
was thinking about not corning back to 
Yale. My parents sent me to their psychol-
ogist and I went and she really tried to get 
me to hope, to believe in myself, to believe 
in the Jungian psychology she was present-
ing me with, and it was actually the realiza-
tion that I couldn't have faith in what she 
was saying that brought me back to my 
faith. I realized that everyone operates on 
the basis of faith. There is no neutral 
worldview to fall back on. The key was 
shifring my focus away from myself to the 
source of my faith, which is God. 

TNJ: How did these moments of crisis affict 
your family relationships? 

Guillen: There was some letdown of my 
dad. I don't really know why-his 
Catholicism is very Mexican-Catholic, 
Mary's always there, but it doesn't really 
have any bearing on his life. The first diffi-
cult point was back in high school when I 
wasn't confirmed . . . But then I feel like 
when I told him I was an atheist that some-
how transformed him and he became more 
religious. My mom, as well, . . . her faith 
didn't really have any bearing on her until I 
abandoned it. 

Karabelnik: It's definitely been a conflict. 
My family is more culturally Jewish than 
anything else, but when I was twelve I was 
supposed to have a Bat Mitzva9~ and I said, 
"I just can't say I believe in this, I'm not 
going just to do something for the sake of 
doing it." And the whole synagogue culture 
had turned me off, because I hadn't 
encountered what I was looking for in 
terms of authentic faith that affected all of 
life . . . My family first of all just felt like 
they had failed in bringing me up to 
embrace, not necessarily religious values, 
but an appreciation for my heritage and for 
the liberal values that they had brought me 
up with. And my father, for instance, said, 
"I would be just as upset if you became 
Ortho<;lox Jewish as what you're doing now, 
the same fundamentalism that I can't relate 
to." The hardest has been my grandmoth-
er because she's a Holocaust survivor and 
for her "Christian" is equated with "Nazi." 
How can I betray the family? How can I 
do this and bring such shame upon every-
one? What I really try to do is just live out 
my faith to show them that it has made me 
a better person. That I'm able to love them 
more than I ever have ... And my mother, 
she's supportive as much as she can be. She 
doesn't understand, but she says, you know, 
you have children and you have to be will-
ing to accept the fact that they might be 
very different from you. 

I'm getting married this summer and 
my fiance is in training to become a pastor 
and that doesn't help things. [Giggle] The 
sphere that I will be in will be very hard for 
them to understand, and my Yale educa-
tion will be put to use in a way they can't 
understand. 

Kob~U~Z: Of course it means that your 
mother's words might be taken not only as 
a statement of acceptance but as a warning.

Karabelnile: Oh yeah, she's like, "Just wait 
till you have kids!" 

KobtUa: My parents were more upset that 
I became too Catholic when I declared 
myself a conscientious objector for reli-
gious reasons ... It's still sort of a struggle 
for them because it's meant having to deal 
with things like me being arrested, going to 
jail, going to courts, and that's difficult for 
any parent no matter what the justification 
is ... My mother's 84 and there are points 
where some article will come up, and some-
one will say to her, "Is that your son?" and 
she will say. "Yes. It is." [Laught~ There is 
a sense that underneath it all there's a 
recognition. 

TNJ: Could you state for the record what it is 
that you put your faith in? 

Stul: I have faith in the sdf as an embodi-
ment of an ultimate unity. 

G1Uikn: I put my faith in the evolution of 
man socially. 

Butler: I'm going to pass. 

Karabemile: I have faith in the saving work 
of Christ through his death on the cross. 

KobtUa: I would go with what the Catholic 
worker community says, which is that 
Grace is what the measure of the world is ... 
Because that's the only place where mean-
ing comes, you know, even when the strug-
gle is marked by failure, it's not futile ... I 
think, at least in the generic sense, most 
faiths claim to give you som~ sense of 
what's meaningful about human existence 
and activity, given the fact that you die.
