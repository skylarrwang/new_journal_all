work his crews have done. "Everything's 
new," he explained as he showed me 
through a "gingerbread" Victorian resi-
dence on Elm Street that he recently began 
restoring. He has added new windows, 
new floors, new tiling in "New Period" 
bathrooms, a new roof (a 4o-year, he notes, 
as opposed to a mere 20-year), and new, 
hand-painted ballisters. 
Upstairs, he 
showed me a set of windows that he per-
sonally designed to prevent small children 
from falling out. "It's really a lot of fun to 
fix up houses," he exclaimed gleefully. "It's 
like Legos on a large scale." 

As we stood on the newly finished 
floor of another house on Edgewood 
Avenue, Greer pointed out an old stained-
glass window that the previous owner had 
covered in paint. One of Greer's workers 
cleaned the glass and framed it in wood 
that matches the original paneling of the 
room. This attention to detail is almost an 
obsession for Greer. Throughout my tour, 
he hurled order afrer order at his son 
Eliezer, who comes home from Brown 
every weekend to help out. 

The workforce creating these immacu-
late homes is f.Urly diverse: One day I 
found a mixed-gender group of Eastern 
European immigrants painting a house. 
Greer offers only that he employs "full-time 
workers" from construction firms. When I 
asked about tenants, he answered that he 
rents to the "public" -which he assured me 
includes both Jews and other minorities-
for "low market" prices. His requirements 
for rental are similarly vague: "Stability, 
reliability, good track-record." 

But even if Greer rents f.Urly according 
to the law, his project looks suspiciously 
like gentrification. He is known for exert-
ing rigid control over his properties. When 
one tenant altered the landscaping in the 
yard, Greer evicted and sued him. 

According to McCormack, Greer threw 
out a group of Southern Connecticut State 
University students who had been throw-
ing parties. Edgewood residents tell stories, 
as well, about Greer's lack of sympathy for 
his neighbors. When Stark wrote Greer a 
letter that expressed concern about the tall 
fences he installs on every property, Greer 
refused to speak with him. 

In another, 
more bizarre instance, neighbors around 
Greer's own residence complained that the 
goats that he keeps in his backyard were 
emitting a foul smell.

Greer admits he is "not a saint." He finds that safe streets and stable rents 
make life better for students at his school and for members of his congrega-
tion. He stands a better chance of sustaining his ultra-Orthodox com-
munity in the more secure environment his housing empire and 
tireless work has created. But if the houses improve the neigh-
borhood, he asks, what is the harm? Greer has dubbed 
this philosophy "entrepreneurial, nonprofit 
self-interest." 

Quoting the Book of Jeremiah and Rabbi 
Hillel, Greer tells me that institutions have an 
obligation to tend to their neighborhoods. 
"We've got to do something for the neighborhood 
in which we live," he says. 

Why? Because local 
groups get the job done better than "unimaginative, 
bureaucratic" government. Greer told Freedman the 
very same thing. "Government can't do," he said. "It 
can only assist. And where it arrogates to itself the idea 
of running families, schools, cities, it makes them 
worse. It destroys more than it builds."

N FEBRUARY 1, 2002, GEORGE W. BusH named 
Jim Towey the new head of the White House 
Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives. 
In doing so, he revived a program that had laid the ~"i~~~~~~!~!!~~~~~= 
foundation for the "compassionate conser-
{ 
varism" upon which he built his presidential 
campaign. Bush's words at the announce-
ment of the hiring perfectly echo Greer's 
views 
on 
religion 
and 
politics. 
"Government cannot stand in the way of 
the good works of the people in our neigh-
borhoods," he said. 
"Government must 
expedite and stand on the side of faith-based 
programs. We should not discriminate at the 
federal level against people who are trying to help 
us solve the nation's problems." 

But in eschewing one kind of "discrimina-
tion," Bush's support of f.Uth-based groups Like 
Greer's opens up entirely new realms of discrimi-
nation. Greer is free to rent to whom he likes, to 
evict whom he hates, and, in effect, to shape a 
community that conforms to his own interests and 
ideals with Little, or no, accountability. Greer's 
attempt to strengthen Edgewood has made it less 
democratic. "One has to be careful not to have the 
state take over for the Almighty," he admitted in 
Freedman's book. Ultimately, the fate of Edgewood 
rests in the hands of one man alone.
