shrouded in black lace, were installed in 
Center Church's balcony, alongside the 19 
relegated photos. Meanwhile, the op-ed 
pages of the New Haven Register discussed 
the significance of the work's removal. 
Frank Harris, a Register columnist and 
journalism 
professor 
at 
Southern 
Connecticut State University, viewed the 
incident as "indicative of the way many 
white Americans do not want to talk about 
slavery. We have a constant desire to forget 
about the past." 


D 
lXWELL AVENUE UNITED CHURCH 
stands a Â· mile and a half north of 
Center Church on the Green. The newly 
relocated Silence will soon be on display 
inside. 
Dixwell Church is one of the largest 
predominantly African-American churches 
in New Haven. It is situated next to an 
abandoned, gated yard and the Elm Haven 
Housing Project. Directly across the street 
is the blighted Dixwell Plaza. Founded in 
1829, Dixwell Church was conceived by 
Simeon 
S. 
Jocelyn, 
a 
white 
Congregationalist and member of Center 
Church. After witnessing the mistreatment 
of blacks at Center Church, Jocelyn took 
up their cause by holding private services 
for African-Americans in his own home. 
Nine years later, Jocelyn, along with a 
group of 19 black congregants, started the 
Temple Street Church, later to be known as 
the 
Dixwell 
Avenue 
Congregational 
Church.

The 19 photographs of Silence symbol-
ize Dixwell Church's 19 founders, and as 
symbols they have taken on lives of their 
own. In the same way that the African-
American members of Center Church were 
forced from the main floor to the balcony, 
Silence, without the consent of its creators, 
was banished to the balcony before its relo-
cation to Dixwell. Some might say that if 
Center Church was in fact trying to forget 
its flawed past, it failed. In the end, Center 
Church repeated its past. 


However, according to the Reverend 
John H. Scott of Dixwell Church, what 
took place at Center Church was no more 
than "a huge misunderstanding." Brushing 
aside the high-minded and moralizing ten-
dencies of the artists and critics alike, Scott 
believes that critics of Center Church's 
decision disregard the church's purely prac-
tical concerns. "If the pictures weren't on 
the pews, it would have been an entirely 
different story," Scott maintains. Of 
course, the photographs, including depic-
tions of Scott and his son, will seem even 
more imposing in his own, smaller church. 
Scott's voice sounds weary from trying to 
convince too many cynics that the events of 
the past months are not a case of history 
repeating itself. "Center Church is a very 
progressive, loving, and uplifting church. 
They are open and affirming," he says, 
"Each congregation has the. right to deter-
mine what is best for their church." 


Scott's point seems valid. Race rela-
tions, in any city, cannot be reduced to 
black and white, nor can they be accurate-
ly represented by cardboard cutouts. 
Center Church on the Green is in fact con-
sidered a progressive church by many, 
which is part of the reason it was originally 
invited to host Silence. It has been praised 
for irs encouragement of the local unions, 
and it supported "Yale, Slavery and 
Abolition," a report published by three Yale 
graduate students which described Yale's 
past relationship with slaveholders. 


The belief that race relations cannot 
be simplified cehainly works both ways. It 
was only six months ago that Center 
Church appointed its first African-
American layman. Reaching back to the 
19th century, Jocelyn, whom Scott praises 
for his humanitarian impulses, originally 
founded Temple Church not because he 
believed that blacks deserved equality per 
se, but because he thought that moral dis-
cipline among the African-American popu-
lation was in decline. Jocelyn is remem-
bered as both a founder of the first African-
American Church in New Haven and an 
active 
member 
of 
American 
Colonization Society, which advocated the 
return of freed slaves to Liberia. 


"We may not always realize the ways 
in which history impacts the way we act 
today," McCallum says. According to 
Harris, Silence and its distance from Center 
Church reflect the separation, created with 
the formation of Dixwell Church, between 
African-American and white churches in 
New Haven. "Throughout New Haven," 


Harris says, "we can sec black churches on 
the outskirts of the city and white church-
es in the center." One cannot help but 
reflect on the deeper significance of 
Sikncls displacement. The mere represen-
tations of black church members, 173 years 
after the creation of Dixwcll Church and 
the onset of segregation by choice, could 
not be accepted as part of Center Church's 
congregation or as part of its history. As 
Harris says, "I guess it's easier to forget." 


McCallum and Tarrf, on the other 
hand, want people to remc~mber. "Exhibits 
like Siknu," McCallum says, "bring up 
serious questions about private and public 
spaces." "The congregation of Center 
Church was forced to engage with 
[Siknce]," says Tarry. "They didn't really 
have any choice." The phoros, in the 
church's center, demanded confrontation 
and recognition. 


Still, New Havencrs like Reverend 
Scott insist that Center Church's decision 
was simply practical. If there is a divide 
between Dixwell Church and Center 
Church on the Green, the 
members of the churches 
themselves do not sense it. 
At the service commemorat-
ing the 17oth anniversary of 
DixweU Church's founding, 
Center Church's Parsons 
delivered a sermon with 
Scott. 


Scott remains con-
vinced that searching for a 
deeper meaning behind the 
story of Siknce would be 
misguided. "It's always good 
to lift up history," Scott 
says, "but the exhibit posed 
problems that we did not 
contemplate." 


But the intention of 
Siknce was co do just that. 
While some object to the 
aggressive agenda of public 
art like Siknce and Witness, 
McCallum 
and 
Tarry 
believe that they have a duty 
to fulfill. "As artists," Tarry 
asserts, "we have a responsibility to go 
beyond what a historian would do-
beyond a didactic instruction. We have to 
create something that makes the viewer 
question. We have to engage dynamics that 
are lasting." To McCallum, Center 
Church's claim that Siknu blocked the 
view of the pulpit remains baseless. "If you 
have 19 people in a church that siz.c, it feels 
empty," McCallum states, "With these 19, 
the church somehow felt full?" 


T 
ARRY AND McCALLUM KNOW THEIR 
work in New Haven is far from com-
plete. "We have a responsibility to see the 
artwork through 
to another stage," 
McCallum says. T he couple, along with 
Artspace, 
worked 
with 
Community 
Mediation of Fair Haven to help facilitate 
an interracial dialogue dealing specifically 
with Siknce. Far from becoming embit-
tered, Tarry and McCallum were motivated 
by their experience in New Haven to fur-
ther explore race relations through public 
art. "The sequence of events that took 
place in New H aven was the first step in a 
national project," Tarry affirms. The cou-
ple's next exhibit will travel the route of the 
Underground Railroad, playing the testi-
monies and recreating the stories of the 
descendants of slaves, bondsmen, and abo-
litionists. 


Back in their Brooklyn studio, 
McCallum takes a deep breath as he finish-
es telling his own swry. "The easiest thing 
for Center Church to do," he reflects, 
"would be to wait for this all to disappear. 
Just close their eyes and wait till it goes 
over." But Siknce has shown that the lega-
cy of slavery will not long remain unseen.
