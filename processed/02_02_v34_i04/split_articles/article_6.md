As I wALK IN, the colorful Christmas deco-
rations and slight buzz in the air remind 
me of a successful community center or a 
small company. Phones ring with business-
like regularity. Someone laughs. A young 
child interruptS her play and looks up, 
smiling ·pleasantly. Everything is spacious, 
brig~t, and clean. All in all, 
Connecticut branch of the Church of 
Scientology gives off a soothing vibe. 

''I'm glad you made it." My contact 
Donna greers me warmly. She isn't used to 
seeing many Yalies, with the church located 
so far away on the outskirtS of New Haven. 
Immediately, she pulls me into a quiet cor-
ner and happily divulges the fundamentals 
of Scientology. Scienrology is the study of 
knowledge and truth. It's ·a religious philos-
ophy aimed at improving the daily life of 
its adherentS. Their goal is "total free-
dom" -freedom from man's undesired 
emotions, from unnecessary chemicals, 
from depression and insecurity. The 
Church claims to do it all, even advertising 
itS ability to increase your IQ. But there is 
no mention of spirituality here, because 
above all the Church worships science. 

But Scientology also worships the holy 
dollar. The beige walls are plastered with 
posters advertising a dazzling array of 
courses; the shelves strain under the weight 
of the many volumes written by the 
Church's guru L. Ron Hubbard. His pres-
ence hauntS the room. The posters cry out 
his name in bold capitals; his suave, mag-
netic vo1ce echoes from a television. 

Courses can cost anywhere from $60 co 
$6oo. The Church even offers special pack-
age deals. Commit yourself co a whole 
series of courses and you may get 20 per-
cent off. The dizzying collection of price 
tags conveys a simple message: Show us 
your wallet and we'll show you who you 
are. And, more importantly, how you can 
live better. 

Donna tells me that she truly wants to 
help me. She runs me through a 200-ques-
tion personality test. A computer then eval-
uates the results, spewing out its verdict 
unmercifully: I am affiicted with pretty 
much every mental ailment that has ever 
been diagnosed. Depression. Lack of confi-
dence. 
Irresponsibility. 
Submission. 
Withdrawal. "Something needs ro be 
done," Donna tells me. She exhales softy, 
her brows furrowed with worry. She sug-
gests that I come back some other day 
when we'll start tackling these issues one by 
one. 

As I part with Donna, the office 
exudes positivity. A man whistles. A 
woman laughs. Donna herself glows in 
saintly contentment. She's happy, I think. 
She may have spent five thousand dollars to 
reach that state, or 50,000. At these prices, 
however, happiness might be something 
my money can't buy. 


**Title: Captain America**

Op COURSE I'VE SEEN HIM. That's exaccly 
why he's there--every Sunday, parading 
down Elm Street in front of Christ Church, 
clad head co roe in red, white, and blue. 
His shout like a cluster bomb, irs reach 
extending through my bedroom window, 
blocks away: USA! USA! And that other 
noise, the crack of his flag as it cutS through 
the wind. Unseen, it sounds almost like 
cackling-just what you'd expect from the 
madman on the street. 

Up close, however, the madman is 
milder. Zeqir Berisha is old, near 70, with 
a jack-o-lanrern face. His Old World smile 
is deliciously broad, with gaps berween 
each crooked tooth. His skin is worn cough 
with the weather, and his eyes seem to light
