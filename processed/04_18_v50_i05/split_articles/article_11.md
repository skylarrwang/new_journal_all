“W
elcome to the Town Green 
District!” says Win Davis, Town 
Green Services’ Executive Director, sit-
ting against an office wall branded with the organization’s 
logo as he smiles mildly at the camera. “Let’s look at some 
of the meaningful ways that we make downtown New 
Haven a better place for everybody.” Shifting images fill 
the screen: a lamp-lit thoroughfare, a crowd gathered to 
watch a broadcast of the World Cup. Scenes of hardwork-
ing “downtown ambassadors” hanging potted plants and 
sweeping sidewalks alternate with testimonials from local 
officials and professionals. In one clip, a bridal shop owner 
stands before a rack of red and blush dresses.“Developing 
the neighborhood helps everybody,” she says.

Created in 1996 through a ballot referendum, the 
Town Green District encompasses an L-shaped twen-
ty-seven square-block area cradling its namesake, the New 
Haven Green. Town Green Services –– the organization 
that created and oversees the District –– aims “to improve 
ownership values by making Downtown New Haven an 
internationally competitive urban environment,” accord-
ing to its mission statement. A private organization with 
paid professional staff, Town Green Services collected 
$1.3 million last year from surtaxes placed on New Haven 
businesses, but it also receives annual contributions from 
Yale and the City of New Haven, who contributed $140 
thousand and $50 thousand in 2017, respectively. These 
funds are used for cleanup and beautification initiatives, 
events, marketing, and the salaries of downtown ambassa-
dors: representatives who patrol Downtown in blue and 
yellow jackets.

These ambassadors share office space with the New 
Haven Police Department, but they don’t have the author-
ity to enforce law. Instead, they contact officers-on-duty 
about “quality of life infractions,” which include public 
intoxication and “aggressive panhandling.” In our inter-
view, Davis tells viewers that contacting police officers 
helps the ambassadors respond to issues downtown. “But,” 
he continues, “it also helps us, because people know that 
when we make a call on our radio or on our telephone, 
action will come of it.”

 Quality of life violations also include behaviors like uri-
nation and defecation. Locals experiencing homelessness 
once had access to public bathrooms on the Green, but 
Town Green Services had them removed, claiming the 
bathrooms sheltered drug deals and prostitution. Home-
less individuals may now use only public bathrooms in the 
public library and City Hall –– when they’re open –– or 
else gain access to business bathrooms, lest they incur a 
fine by relieving themselves in public. Under a 2015 col-
laboration between the city police and Town Green Ser-
vices called Project Green Thumb, indigent people cited 
for quality-of-life infractions were enrolled to clean and 
beautify the District in lieu of paying a fine.
