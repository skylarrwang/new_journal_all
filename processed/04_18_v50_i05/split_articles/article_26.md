to manage a donation of two hundred acres from a 
local landowner. In a remarkable environmental-
ist community effort, they turned the land over to 
the state for the creation of Sleeping Giant State 
Park.

This effort might have gone even further, as 
local residents had long played around with the 
idea to create a park spanning from New Haven to 
Hamden. The park would have joined East Rock 
and extended all the way up north to Sleeping 
Giant, but residential and commercial interests 
prevented this effort. While Hulten would have 
appreciated having such vast space set aside for 
nature, she laughed and admitted that if the plans 
were completed, her house wouldn’t be there 
today.  

Parks like East Rock and Sleeping Giant con-
tinue to play an important role in the community, 
from organized hikes to outdoor classrooms. In the 
summer, students toss Frisbees at the East Rock 
summit; in the winter, when the ground is cov-
ered in snow, some Special Olympics participants 
have used the flat open spaces around Sleeping 
Giant for ski training. “It’s a place for recreation 
and re-creation,” said Hulten. “Any folks will say 
that’s my sanctuary –– that’s where I go to clear 
my head. We all need natural places, away from 
noises and people.” 

Robert Thorson is a professor at the University of 
Connecticut who describes his work as “cultural 
geology.” He studies how humans might impact 
the natural landscape’s future, and educates the 
public about their stake in the environment. 

“When you take someone outside in a real setting, 
away from a desktop and away from a classroom 
and away from a laboratory, when you take them 
into some place they could have been a hundred 
thousand years ago, I think they feel differently 
about it…there’s a Paleolithic sort of power at 
heart.”

Thorson thinks that at the end of the day, peo-
ple are inspired by this same feeling when they 
encounter geological features, whether hiker or 
geologist. “Geologists are in the field because 
there’s this visceral sense of being outdoors some-
where looking at something,” he said. “Even if 
they spend ninety percent of their time in the lab 
sorting microfossils, they’re still really interested 
in the place. It’s the lakes, the river valley, the 
up-faulted block that interests people.” 

While we use these natural spaces to 
“get away” from society, it’s impossible 
not to bring human influences with us 
into these environments.  Thorson advocates for 
greater public awareness of natural history, so that 
Connecticut residents can make informed deci-
sions about the future based on the past. 

Thorson believes that humans hold the power 
to bring about great positive or negative impacts 
on the landscape. Columbia researcher Peter 
LeTourneau describes parks like East Rock, West 
Rock, and Sleeping Giant as valuable “sky islands,” 
contained ecological areas in a largely urban land-
scape. Thorson laments how the increased urban-
ization of Connecticut threatens these spaces. In 
a shift to what he calls “exit-ramp culture,” cities 
and roads have cut across the landscape, replacing 
birches and pines with gas stations and highways. 

He wants more places like East Rock, West Rock, 
and Sleeping Giant, which serve as refuges both 
for people who seek nature, and for nature itself. 

In the effort to protect our natural spaces, Thor-
son thinks that geologists play a key role in under-
standing the human impact on the environment. 

“I think the most important thing is to evaluate 
the ways in which human beings in the last four 
hundred years have modified the landscape,” said 
Thorson. “It’s only fair to talk about human beings 
as geologic agents.” While 
human 
beings 
have 
only 
appeared for a sliver of a sec-
ond on the geological clock, 

they’ve modified the landscape with impunity, 
from the quarrying of the colonists to the ambi-
tious construction projects taking place today. 

Merguerian offers a slightly different perspec-
tive. He’s contributed to the construction of 
highways and subway tunnels, for instance, by 
researching rock types suitable for drilling. His 
work represents a source of contention among 
geologists, who have often felt conflicted about 
their knowledge being used for development 
rather than preservation. 

Merguerian thinks such a conflict is unneces-
sary. He believes we should continue using our 
natural resources, while developing judicious 
ways to make use of our environment without 
exhausting it. When he helped with the con-
struction of the Queens Tunnel in New York, he 
thought, ‘Why not just leave the rocks instead of 
paving them over with concrete, so people can 
appreciate their natural beauty?’ His idea was dis-
missed, but he hopes that more people can under-
stand that the relationship between humans and 
the environment is not an issue of two extremes, 
but rather of compromise. 

In his writings, Thorson references a quote from 
Thoreau: “The earth is not a mere fragment 
of dead history, stratum upon stratum like the 
leaves of a book to be studied by geologists and 
antiquarians chiefly, but living poetry like the 
leaves of a tree, which precede flowers and fruit 
–– not a fossil earth, but a living earth.” 

Throughout history, people have found their 
own ways to understand and interact with Con-
necticut’s landscape, from the Quinnipiac to geol-
ogists like Thorson. The lens through which peo-
ple have interpreted these geologic landmarks has 
changed based on the era. But through it all, these 
natural landmarks have continually captivated the 
public’s interest and imagination.

Now, more than ever, humans exert great con-
trol over their environments, shaping and re-shap-
ing them at their whim –– as powerfully, in some 
senses, as continental plates. By recognizing this 
power, humans may begin to reconsider their rela-
tionship with the landscape.

The New Haven community has done so by 
striving to co-live with natural spaces –– not only 
co-existing, but interacting with nature on a per-
sonal and daily level. The city of New Haven is 
nestled between the natural sanctuaries of East 
Rock and West Rock. Residents in the East Rock 
neighborhood live walking distance to the land-
mark. From organized hikes and runs to the Rock 
to Rock Earth Day bike race, community events 
show that New Haven would not be the same city 
without these parks.

It is impossible to predict what the landscape 
will look like in 200 million years, or even in two 
hundred years. But geologists, historians, and resi-
dents alike all hope that these remarkable natural 
spaces will continue to be an integral part of New 
Haven’s identity.

From the twelve-storied Kline Biology Tower on 
Science Hill of Yale’s campus, the view extends 
across the city. Looking out, one can see East Rock 
far in the distance, marked by the Sailors and Sol-
diers monument at its peak. Its tall and impres-
