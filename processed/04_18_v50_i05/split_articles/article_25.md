From the top of East Rock today, these dramatic 
events are hardly apparent. Visitors to East Rock 
and West Rock, the rocky ridges that flank New 
Haven, or Sleeping Giant mountain in neighbor-
ing Hamden only see a stable landscape covered 
in greenery. Hikers are likely unaware that these 
parks once stood at the borders between conti-
nents, or that they’re tracing the footsteps of pre-
historic dinosaurs.  
Though the community relies on the parks as 
local hubs of exercise and leisure, most people 
know very little about the stories of these land-
marks –– stories that have shaped the human his-
tory of Connecticut for centuries.  
New Haven sits on the 
birth scars of the Atlantic 
Ocean. The rocks here 
tell the story of its 
human history.

**Title: Connecticut’s Geological History**
**Page number(s): 32-33**

For geologists, East Rock and West Rock 
aren’t weekend hangout spots –– they’re 
ground zero in a dramatic story about how 
the earth under our feet has shifted ever since the 
planet first formed. Geologists investigate how 
continental collisions and lava flows shaped the 
landscape of Connecticut, uniquely positioned at 
the fault lines of Pangaea. 
To understand why Connecticut’s landmarks 
fascinate geologists, I met with Professor Charles 
Merguerian from Hofstra University, a leading 
expert on geologic structure and plate tectonics 
in Connecticut and New York. He had come to 
New Haven to visit the Yale Peabody Museum’s 
geology collection, and asked me to meet him 
there. Dressed in jeans and hiking boots, Mergue-
rian showed me his collection of rocks in the back 
rooms of the museum, stored from his graduate 
school research projects.  
“Geologists are like detectives,” he told me as 
he opened a drawer, revealing tagged slabs of 
rocks about the size of my palm. The rocks seem 
unremarkable at first glance –– they’re what Mer-
guerian calls “ugly rocks,” chunks that can be 
seen at the side of any road –– but these are often 
extremely valuable to scientists. These rocks, 
which Merguerian collected from construction 
sites around Connecticut and New York, carry the 
record of geologic events that occurred in New 
England hundreds of millions of years ago. 
In his research, Merguerian uses a special saw 
blade to cut the rocks into paper-thin slices. He 
analyzes the slices to figure out what minerals 
are present. “These minerals…tell you how deep 
the rocks were, how old they were, under what 
temperatures and pressures they formed,” he 
explained. Since certain minerals can only form 
at precise temperatures, pressures, and locations, 
he uses this information to piece together the story 
of continental-scale collisions and breakages that 
shaped Connecticut. 
As Merguerian recounted to me, Connecticut’s 
story began as Pangaea formed. Around 450 mil-
lion years ago, the continental plates began to 
crash together to form Pangaea. North America 
and Africa collided in an event called the Taconic 
Orogeny, where the earth’s crust wrinkled, build-
ing mountain ranges that make up the present-day 
Appalachians. 
Then, 275 million years later, Pangaea started 
to break apart. Magma seeped out from the crust 
as gaps between the plates opened up. The peel-
ing apart of the North American and African con-
tinents created the Hartford Basin, the jagged rift 
basin spanning across Connecticut and Massa-
chusetts today.
“[The basin] marked the fracturing of the edge 
of North America, when Africa as a continental 
landmass started to spread away from North Amer-
ica,” explained Merguerian. Around this time, 
Merguerian said, the coastline would have resem-
bled what the East African Rift looks like today, a 
massive trench running across the continent.
East Rock, West Rock, and Sleeping Giant 
all formed 175 million years ago when Pangaea 
broke apart. Magma cooled underground and was 
pushed to the surface by continental movement 
to expose igneous rock. In the following hundreds 
of millions of years, these rocks were shaped into 
Lava flows, volcanic 
eruptions, and glacial 
events continued to 
shape the landscape — 
literally molding Con-
necticut by fire and ice.


their present form. The rocks contain mainly dia-
base and basalt with a high iron content, explain-
ing the dark brownish-reddish color. The stair-like 
appearance of these ridges led to their technical 
name, “trap rock” ridges, from the Swedish word 
“trappsteg,” meaning “stair.”
Like these landmarks, most of the rocks New 
Haven residents see and walk on today all came 
from deep within the earth. “The surface of rock 
that you drive on and look at in Connecticut, 
along the highways and walking through the wood 
–– [the] bedrock that’s now exposed to the surface 
–– was exhumed from depths of at least twenty 
to twenty-five miles beneath the earth’s surface 
today,” said Merguerian.
Finally, starting around two hundred thousand 
years ago, a series of glaciers added the finish-
ing touches to our modern landscape, sprinkling 
boulders across the land and remodeling the Con-
necticut River Valley. These events –– from the 
formation and breakage of Pangaea to the most 
recent glaciation –– shaped the environment 
where we walk and live and breathe every day.  
Merguerian feels that his scientific understand-
ing of the area allows a deeper connection with 
the landscape. “There are people that like to drive 
cars without knowing anything about how the cars 
work,” he said. “Others take great pleasures in 
knowing the inner mechanical secrets of how cars 
work, because it enhances the driving experience. 
Same thing with the earth’s surface.”


But the story of Connecticut is incomplete 
as only a geologic tale. As humans became 
a part of the landscape, they too began to 
shape it. To understand the role of humans in 
Connecticut’s natural history, I met with Julie 
Hulten, the community outreach chair at Sleeping 
Giant State Park. We spoke in the History Room 
at the Hamden Library, which was filled with doc-
uments, pictures, and models that showed what 
the town looked like throughout the ages. She 
sifted through black-and-white photos of Sleep-
ing Giant, with families posing proudly in front of 
cabins on its rocky head.  
Ten years ago, Hulten, a Hamden resident and 
former teacher, started regularly hiking Sleeping 
Giant and decided to help with its preservation. 
She now both contributes to the upkeep of the 
park and the documentation of its history. Hulten 
picked up the story of the landscape for me, now 
on a human, rather than geologic, timescale.  
The Quinnipiac nation, which has inhabited 
this part of New England from long before Euro-
pean contact, has a legend explaining how Sleep-
ing Giant was formed. The Quinnipiac tell stories 
of the giant Hobbomock, a powerful spirit who 
had taught all people and animals to speak the 
same language. When they drifted apart and lost 
this ability, he was enraged. He started ripping up 
trees, and, with one stomp of his foot, created a 
bend in the course of the Connecticut River. 
In order to stop Hobbomock from wreaking 
havoc on the landscape, his brother Keitan cast a 
spell on him to get him to fall asleep. Hobbomock 
has yet to wake up today. For the Quinnipiac, the 
place exists as a living, breathing part of the Earth. 
When British colonists arrived in Connecti-
cut, they settled around trap rock ridges like East 
Rock, West Rock, and Sleeping Giant, where they 
found rich construction materials like brownstone 
for their houses and churches. As the tale goes, 
in the 1660s, several judges had sentenced King 
Charles I to death during the English Civil War, 
and sought refuge in the New Haven wilderness. 
They hid in a cave now called Judges Cave in 
West Rock, and spent several months there until 
being chased out by a mountain lion.  
Society’s relationship with the landscape began 
to change with industrialization in the 1800s, 
when for the first time, interested naturegoers had 
to actively seek out natural spaces. As the transcen-
dentalist movement took hold, more people grew 
interested in nature as a respite from industrial 
daily life. East Rock and Sleeping Giant became 
popular tourist destinations.
The wealthy of New Haven and Hamden built 
cabins along the ridges of Sleeping Giant and 
would stay there during the summers. A local 
named John Dickerman constructed a carriage 
road and a pavilion on one of the ridges, and held 
an ice cream social to celebrate its completion; 
such projects ushered in a new age of outdoor rec-
reation. 
At the same time, these natural spaces were 
not outside the influences of industrialization. 
In 1911, the Mount Carmel Traprock Company 
began to quarry the Giant’s “head” for its valuable 
building materials. Successive companies joined 
in on the quarrying as America developed its love 
for the automobile, and years of blasting and stone 
removal left deep scars on the Giant’s head. Locals 
complained about the noise and worried that quar-
rying might destroy the landscape. In 1924, under 
the leadership of Yale professor James Toumey, 
citizens formed Sleeping Giant Parks Association
