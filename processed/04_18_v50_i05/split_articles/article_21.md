1997, a dozen charter schools opened their doors across 
the state. One of those, Common Ground High School, 
still runs in New Haven today. Unlike Amistad, which is 
part of the Achievement First network, it’s an indepen-
dent, standalone school. And while it, too, challenges 
established models of learning, it’s pushing students in 
a very different direction: outdoors, and into their com-
munity.


An Uncommon Curriculum
A
kieleh Zidbeck and Brian Chantre are designing a 
skyscraper. They envision a towering white struc-
ture with countless Chlorophytum comosa, or spi-
der plants, hanging off, their long, thin leaves sticking out 
every which way. Passersby will be able to pluck a plant 
right off and take it with them. “Then,” Zidbeck explains, 
“the whole world will know the benefit of spider plants.”


Right now, all Zidbeck and Chantre have is a tiny C. 
comosum in a white Chobani cup, but it’s the germ of a 
much larger idea. The pair are students in a course at 
Common Ground High School called the Senior Social 
Justice Experience. Zidbeck, who wears silver, undulat-
ing snake earrings and a wide smile, became interested 
in architecture after she took a course in sustainable 
design. The spider plants address an issue that’s affected 
her own life. “I grew up in a low-income community,” 
she explained. “A lot of kids had respiratory issues. These 
plants absorb particulates like xylene formaldehyde” — a 
toxin linked to upper respiratory tract infections. Zidbeck 
and Chantre have been spending hours in the school’s 
woodshop, finishing up a planter with three wooden bins 
for the C. comosa, to be placed in the hallway of one of 
Common Ground’s school buildings. The bins are tiered 
like a staircase, gesturing up towards something bigger.


Founded in 1997 by the New Haven Ecology Project 
as a place to promote environmental education, Com-
mon Ground and its two hundred students are bounded 
by a small farm at the base of the property and enclo-
sures for chickens and goats just up the hill. The school 
emphasizes community engagement through programs 
like Environmental Ventures, in which students develop 
entrepreneurial projects and pocket the profits, and Green 
Jobs Corps, which offers low-income students 
jobs at the school’s farm and other community 
organizations.


Common Ground’s courses are often unconventional. 
One former course, “Egg and Seed,” examined the begin-
ning of life cycles in both literature and science. As with 
Achievement First, the autonomy Common Ground has 
as a charter school allows for an outside-the-box curric-
ulum. And its interdisciplinary focus on the outdoors is 
possible only because the school was founded by an envi-
ronmental nonprofit with both a radical vision for educa-
tion and twenty acres abutting a state park.


Maintaining this curricular creativity without compro-
mising students’ test scores presented the school with a 
challenge. Back in 2007, just 30 percent of the school’s 
students earned proficient scores in English on CAP, the 
state’s benchmark test at the time. The school responded 
by implementing a variety of metrics, such as Common 
Core standards, monthly checks on class performance, 
and an in-house reading, language, and math assessment 
called MAP. By 2014, ninety percent of students met CAP 
proficiency levels.


But this shift in focus towards college achievement 
compromised the school’s founding principles of inter-
disciplinary coursework and outdoor programming. “It’s 
always been a tension for any school that’s small and 
independent,” said Liz Cox, Common Ground’s School 
Director. “You’re translating your transcript for a college, 
they see a class called ‘Egg and Seed’ and go, ‘What the 
heck is that?’ But we were losing a sense of our site-based 
classes, which were what this place really was about … 
We wanted to make sure kids felt connected to the place 
and to the city and saw themselves as leaders capable of 
change.” Administrators introduced a set of environmen-
tal leadership standards called POWER to form a new 
foundation for classes. Now, Common Ground students 
follow a carefully curated four-year progression. Ninth 
graders focus on the school’s site, tenth grade courses 
emphasize community engagement, and eleventh and 
twelfth graders follow a more individualized path. The 
Senior Social Justice Experience course is the culmi-
nation: students complete a project like Zidbeck and 
Chantre’s planter and compile a portfolio of their time at 
Common Ground.


Being a charter school facilitated Common Ground’s 
transformation, Cox said. “This year, to move this new 
curriculum out, to offer these kinds of choice-rich offer-
ings, we completely changed our schedule, our school 
“Everybody hates the culture it creates. 
That’s why people are like, you’re going 
back to hell, you’re going back to jail.”

day, the bell schedule, everything, and we did that with 
all of our teachers over the course of three months,” Cox 
said. “I think in a traditional school system, that never 
would have happened.” At charters like Common Ground 
and Achievement First, this kind of experimentation can 
be enacted and implemented immediately.


Unlike Achievement First, Common Ground has 
a peaceful relationship with the local school district, 
according to Torre, the former Board of Education mem-
ber. This is partly because, as an independent school, 
Common Ground is not seen as a threat to non-charters. 
But it’s also because it opens its resources to traditional 
public schools, hosting five thousand students for field 
trips every year. Still, Cox is skeptical that Common 
Ground’s approach to education could be replicated out-
side of a charter school setting. “All charters here are mis-
sion-driven,” she said. “Magnet schools, I look at them 
more as themed schools. Our mission is in our bones. 
It’s infiltrating everything that we do.” As Cox notes, 
the assumption has long held that for traditional public 
schools, experimentation is much more difficult. But one 
public school in New Haven has broken from conven-
tional pedagogy, challenging the notion that a school 
without a charter is a school without a mission.

Working From Within
L
eslie Blatteau’s senior seminar was abuzz one morn-
ing this April. Students sat clustered around six 
rectangular tables, chatting as they waited for the 
lesson to begin. Blatteau strode to the front of the room, 
all business in a white polka-dot button-down and black 
high-top sneakers. “Welcome. We’re going to get started.”


Two students in the front row sat on their phones, tex-
ting. “Folks, I need your focus this morning,” she said, 
addressing the room at large. At another point, two stu-
dents in the back chatted away. “Zach and Victoria, one 
mic, please,” she said firmly. After running through a 
rubric on introductory paragraphs, she passed a sticky 
note to each student. “Tell me what you need,” she said, 
“and tell me what you’re straight with.” Then, the stu-
dents fanned out to the Dell computers lining the periph-
ery of the room and sprang into action. Each was working 
on a six- to eight-page research paper on an international 
human rights issue.


Blatteau teaches a senior seminar on law and political 
science at Metropolitan Business Academy (MBA), a mag-
net school located just south of Wooster Square. While 
traditional public schools in New Haven only admit stu-
dents from the immediate city, magnet schools also admit 
students from surrounding suburban districts via lottery. 
With twenty such schools, New Haven has the largest 
magnet system in the state. But unlike charter schools, 
magnet schools are governed by state education standards 
and held accountable to New Haven’s Board of Educa-
tion, meaning that they face the same curricular restraints 
as traditional public schools.


MBA, though, is different. Classes here, in contrast to 
the vast majority of New Haven’s schools, are not sorted by 
academic ability. Judy Puglisi, the school’s principal, said 
she views the practice of tracking based on perceived abil-
ity level as the product of bias. “Often, children who are 
viewed to have negative character traits don’t get tracked 
appropriately due to adult biases,” she wrote in an email. 
“If a kid has to babysit and doesn’t have time for home-
work after school, this child may be assigned to a lower 
track. The positive aspects of a non-tracked room include 
bringing diversity of thought into the room, challenging 
stereotypes and biases, and improving instructional ped-
agogy.” One student in Blatteau’s course had transferred 
from New Horizons School, a transition school for at-risk 
students, at the start of that year, and was writing his 
first-ever research paper for the course. He had chosen 
to research child exploitation at United States-operated 
factories in Sierra Leone.


At MBA, students receive traditional grades, but most 
of the emphasis is on process; teachers provide extensive 
feedback emphasizing revision and long-term improve-
ment. The research paper Blatteau’s students are working 
on will culminate in a social justice symposium in May, 
where they will present their findings to an audience of 
parents and community members. “Even if the outcome 
isn’t an exemplary paper, the student’s identity changes 
as a result of going through this process of researching 
and writing,” Blatteau said. “The student has internalized 


When New Haven’s 25,000 students sit down at 
their desks, the education they get in each of 
the city’s sixty-seven schools  is  a  product  of 
both  policies  and  priorities.

what it takes to write a research paper; they see themselves 
as a social scientist.”


Eighty-five percent of MBA’s students are of color and 
its faculty is almost all white, making the racial dynamics 
of the classroom a focus for teachers. “Teenagers naturally 
question authority figures because their sense of justice 
and their sense of right and wrong is on overdrive,” Blat-
teau said. “We try as majority-white teachers in this school 
to not see outspoken black and brown teenagers as a threat 
to us, but as people who are trying to make the world a 
better place.”


MBA is a “trauma-informed school,” providing inten-
sive clinical support and counseling for students based 
on their individual needs. Puglisi, noting that students 
who exhibited behavioral issues were often dealing with 
outside stressors, started a weekly after-school drama club 
for students with high rates of absence. She then helped 
develop a course called “Alive,” taught by a history teacher 
and a trauma clinician, that engages with social justice 
issues, much like Common Ground’s senior seminar. 
Now, a team of a social worker, six social work interns, 
and two trauma specialists hold weekly case management 
meetings and develop plans to help individual students.


MBA’s approach –– project-based, non-tracked, trau-
ma-informed –– is the product of over a decades’ work. 
Blatteau and Puglisi met at Connecticut Scholars, a 
now-defunct New Haven school for ninth and tenth grad-
ers, in 2007, where they began to develop the approaches 
that now inform MBA’s core philosophy. “This common 
vision has been systematized and integrated into all 
aspects of the school community,” Puglisi wrote, includ-
ing scheduling, allocating funding, supporting students, 
tracking academic progress, promoting student leader-
ship, and hiring staff. There’s a reason few public schools 
look like this: it’s extremely difficult to do. But Blatteau 
and Puglisi’s work is a testament that while innovation 
may be more difficult to implement at a school like 
MBA than at a charter school like Amistad or Common 
Ground, it’s abundantly possible.
