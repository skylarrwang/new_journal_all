EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
RYAN PATEL, a 30-year-old therapist, sits before a 
fidgeting first-year medical student. Aryan needs med-
ical attention: He has a fever, severe nasal congesion, 
and a sharp constant pain in his right cheek bone. He anx-
iously kneads his knee with his hand, unable to stop thinking 
about his blood tests: are his blood sugar levels too high?
The medical student clasps his hands together and nods 
nervously. “Oh, I see. Okay,” he says. He runs through the 
script in his mind: Elicit details of the patient’s symptoms. 
Ask about past medical care. What he forgets is: How is 
your family? How are you feeling?   

Because he is not asked, Aryan does not reveal that he 
fears he’s inherited his father’s Type 2 Diabetes. He is con-
stantly fatigued, and his tiredness has left him distant, dis-
tracted. As the interview limps to resolution, Aryan looks 
reserved, tense, and forlorn. Unspoken discomfort hangs 
in the air.  

“Great, thank you, that’s great,” comes a voice from 
the corner of the room. With those words, the simulation 
ends. The room breathes a sigh of relief. The observing 
doctor chuckles, “You did a great job. Made me very ner-
vous.” He then gives the medical student a chance to re-at-
tempt parts of the conversation, to offer a warmer tone, to 
ask more personal questions, and to project more empa-
thy. Once the student is through, ‘Aryan’ stands up, breaks 
into a brilliant smile, and ambles out of the room.

We are sitting in a small classroom in the Yale School of 
Medicine’s Hope Building, where four first-year medical 
students and an experienced physician are conducting a 
workshop on interviewing patients. ‘Aryan’ is one of many 
actors –– termed Standardized Patients, or SPs — paid 
to portray patients in medical simulations. SPs were first 
introduced in the United States in the nineteen-seventies, 
and have since become a routine part of every medical 
student’s training and assessment process. These patients 
are played by a motley crew of retirees, aspiring actors, 
and college students. The ailments they perform are 
largely mundane –– sinusitis, chest pain –– but their sur-
face symptoms come with deep-seated anxieties and com-
plex backstories.  

For the medical student, the objective is to get the 
information they need while ensuring that the “patient” 
remains comfortable. But this is no simple task. SPs mem-
orize character sketches with the patient’s background, 
medications, emotional contexts, and family history. To 
uncover all of this in a twenty-minute interview, students 
must be persistent and probing, but also inviting and kind. 
One script used in today’s workshop spells out what a 
patient coming in with heel pain should divulge, but only 
if pressed further:

If asked, the pain feels like a knife when you take a full 
step.

If asked, you like to wear boots or shoes with a medi-
um-sized heel to look professional.

Finding the right question is key. If they ask a yes-or-no 
question, all they get is a yes or a no. If they ask open-ended 
questions, they are rewarded with more information. With 
patience and practice, students learn to gently unravel the 
personal contexts that underlie patients’ symptoms. 

Through simulations with SPs, medical students culti-
vate the skills necessary for patient-centered healthcare, 
which situates symptoms in the context of the patient’s 
broader emotional well-being and lifestyle. Dr. Auguste 
Fortin, professor at the Yale School of Medicine, is interna-
tionally recognized for his educational work in improving 
clinicians’ communication skills and patient experience. 
“[It] is not just touchy-feely… to use patient-centered 
interviewing skills,” he said at a physician-patient commu-
nication conference held in 2011. He rattled off a litany of 
benefits: more accurate diagnoses, improved medication 
compliance, fewer tests and referrals, and faster symp-
tom resolution. In short: better healthcare, with happier 
patients and doctors. 

The American healthcare system is uniquely ineffi-
cient. A 2016 report by Gallup shows that Americans are 
dissatisfied with the services they receive, even while 
spending twice as much on healthcare compared to cit-
izens of other developed nations. In important ways, this 
inefficiency is a product of a system that does not promote 
listening to its patients. As Dr. Fortin argues, “We inter-
rupt our patients prematurely an average of twenty-one 
seconds into a visit. When we do that, we fail to address 
the patient’s concerns, and we fail to really understand 
the patient’s full agenda for why they are seeking health-
care.” When doctors do not convey empathy, patients feel 
alienated. Alienated patients don’t take their medication, 
adhere to advice, or follow up on referrals. 

SPs form the flesh and blood of the shift towards 
patient-centered healthcare. At times, their work places 
extreme emotional demands on them. Jackie Sidle 
worked as a SP in and around New Haven for fourteen 
years before becoming Coordinator of the SP program at 
Danbury Hospital. In one of her most demanding roles, 
she played a woman with borderline personality disorder. 
“That was very difficult because she was suicidal,” said 
Jackie, her tone darkening. “She had been sexually abused 
and raped when she was nine. She was a drug user. She 
was so sad. And she was mean, so that was hard.” Nursing 
students on their psych rotation often left in tears after 
their encounter. 

 “It’s real. It feels real,” Jackie said. “I mean, there’s 
medical equipment around you, there’s someone in a 
white coat and a stethoscope, and you’re sitting in a hos-
pital gown. You’re innately very vulnerable.” SPs find dif-
ferent ways to navigate the reality of their characters’ lives. 
Some bring pictures of their own kids. Jackie used an alias 
every time, a combination of her middle name and the 
street she lived on in Chicago. She never liked using her 
real name. “It just felt like bad karma,” she said, shaking 
her head. 

Another difficult role: being the recipient of bad news. 
Jackie recalled workshops for “Disclosing the Unexpected 
Death of a Loved One”; in one case, the trainee had to 
tell a man that his 50-year-old wife, who came in for a 
checkup after feeling leg pain on a flight, had died while 
he went to run an errand. At times, the simulation was 
so harrowing that the medical students broke down into 
tears. But it was even more fatiguing for the person who 
has to pretend, again and again, to discover that their wife 
is dead. Jackie remembers one SP who volunteered to do 
the simulation three times in a row –– by the end, she 
said, “it looked like a truck hit him.” Now, as Coordinator, 
Jackie limits SPs to no more than two bad news simula-
tions in a row. 

For the most part, however, simulations do not deal 
with severe, life-changing diseases or devastating news. 
In the Yale School of Medicine, SPs flit in and out of 
rooms with ease, rattling off rehearsed answers to stan-
dard questions. Still, one cannot help but be struck by 
how earnestly students approach the patients before them, 
and the professionalism and skill with which the patients 
enact their roles. Outside the simulation, a slight shift in 
tone, or the minutiae of one’s facial expressions –– even a 
moment of eye-contact –– can forever alter a patient’s life. 
But in here, students can make mistakes. They can start 
over. Slowly but surely, even nervous, fidgeting students 
learn when to smile and ask the right questions; when to 
prod, and when to let go; when to talk, and when to sim-
ply listen.
