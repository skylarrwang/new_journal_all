EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Open up your coffers and caress air
Rugged waters and minerals
leap to grasp peach skies
Remember the geometry of birds
was never meant to appeal to you.
You, small observer, trust these blissful aromas.
Unfold the machinery of your heart.
Cosmic stories are written into the spaces
you’ve forgotten to fill.
Below the jade currents are golden silts.
Follow full and follow slowly.
You, ocean of a man, lower your tide
and see how the sand around you dries.
Expose anchors of shipwrecks and yearn
in the melancholy of their perhaps.
Soon you’ll see than holding on relentlessly erodes.
