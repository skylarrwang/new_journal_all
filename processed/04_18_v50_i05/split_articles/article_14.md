As the golden sun begins to tumble down the 
horizon, the Native American Cultural Center, or 
NACC, comes to life. The lights in the conference 
room buzz on, illuminating wooden tables accented with a 
dotting of pastel chairs: sky blue, lavender, mint. It’s Mon-
day night, and I’m attending a class in Lakȟóta, a Native 
American language spoken by around two thousand people 
in North and South Dakota. 

There are five students in class tonight. While each 
belongs to the Lakȟóta nation, they represent three differ-
ent tribes. Bobby Pourier, Jacob Rosales, and Marlee Kelly 
are Oglála Lakȟóta and attended Red Cloud Indian School 
on the Pine Ridge Reservation together. Chase Warren is 
Húŋkpapȟa Lakȟóta, and Luta Fast Dog is Sicangu Lakȟóta. 
They filter in slowly, cupping freshly steeped tea from the 
kitchen and snacks from their dorm rooms. Each finds a 
seat near the TV, where Nacole Walker, a Lakȟóta language 
instructor at Sitting Bull College in North Dakota, Skypes 
in. The students prop open laptops and set down stuffed 
animals: a llama, jackrabbit, and small metal frog, part of 
today’s lesson on postpositions. Unlike English, Lakȟóta 
uses postpositions rather than prepositions, placing words 
after a noun to indicate its relative location. 

“I didn’t have a plush toy!” Pourier protests, wielding his 
metal frog for the camera. The room bubbles with laughter. 
As class commences, seriousness settles in, interspersed 
with wide-grinned laughter. Walker prompts each student 
by name, asking them to describe the relative locations of 
their stuffed animals. 

In many ways, this class is like any other language semi-
nar at Yale. Each student has a reference text open on-screen 
(the New Lakota Dictionary). Their laptops are decorated 
with stickers (“Yale Native,” “Mahalo Ke Akua,” and “Blue 
State Coffee”). But there’s one notable difference: even 
though these students meet twice a week for an hour each 
time and are assigned homework, as they do in other Yale 
classes, they aren’t receiving course credit. 

“Tokša akhé waŋčhíyaŋkiŋ kte,” the five chant in unison, 
as Walker waves goodbye. In English, it means, “I will see 
you later.” 

While only a handful of universities like the University of 
Oklahoma, University of North Dakota, and University of 
South Dakota offer indigenous language courses for credit, 
universities around the country are shifting towards doing 
so. Peer institutions like Stanford and Dartmouth both 
offer Native American Studies majors and a wide selection 
of courses on Native American history. The University of 
Pennsylvania plans to offer Cherokee language classes soon, 
and hopes to expand to other Native American languages 
that can fulfill the four-semester Penn Language Require-
ment, per the Daily Pennsylvanian. 

The Yale NACC’s Native American Language Project, 
founded in 2015, offers seven courses: three intermediate 
classes in Cherokee, Choctaw, and Native Hawaiian, and 
four elementary classes in Lakȟóta, Mohawk, Navajo, and 
Ojibwe, including the class I’m sitting in today. But unlike 
its peers, Yale treats these rigorous seminars more like extra-
curriculars than coursework. Taking Lakȟóta doesn’t get a 
student any closer to a Yale degree, even though, as Walker 
explains to me, she teaches her students with the curricu-
lum she uses at Sitting Bull.

In the United States, 150 to 170 indigenous languages 
remain, remembered primarily by tribal elders due to years 
of targeted assimilation policies by the federal government. 
From 1869 to the mid-twentieth century, Native American 
children around the country were sent to government board-
ing schools meant to “civilize” them. At school, students 
were abused for speaking their indigenous languages, taught 
to reject their culture. Hoping to spare their descendants 
the same ordeal, many chose not to teach the languages to 
their children, who, in turn, have found themselves unable 
to pass the knowledge along. 

As Pourier explained to me, “My great-grandmother went 
to a boarding school where she was routinely beaten, and 
had her mouth washed out with soap if she spoke Lakȟóta. 
As a girl, she decided never to speak the language or pass 
it down to her children so they wouldn’t suffer the same 
abuse. No one in the family spoke Lakȟóta out of fear of 
persecution.”

First-year student Gabriella Blatt, a member of the Chip-
pewa-Cree Tribe in Montana and my suitemate, has a simi-
lar story. Back home on the Rocky Boy Indian Reservation, 
less than twenty of the five thousand residents are fluent in 
Cree. Her mother can’t speak the language, and it wasn’t 
until her grandmother’s dying breath that Blatt heard her 
speak Cree for the first time. For students like Blatt and 
Pourier, the stakes are high: if their generation does not 
learn the languages of the elders, these languages will van-
ish entirely. And language is more than just a way to com-
municate –– for Native Americans and indigenous peoples, 
language is inseparable from culture, Pourier says.

“I have to reintroduce myself to my own culture. As a 
colonized person I can’t understand traditional ceremonies. 
Because I don’t understand the language, I can’t under-
stand it on a spiritual level,” he explains.

Currently, tribes across the United States are working 
diligently to revive their languages. Pourier’s reservation 
school is in its fifth year of operating a language immersion 
program that runs from pre-K through the twelfth grade. 
Soon, they will graduate their first students who are fully 
fluent in Lakȟóta. The question is whether the value of such 
bilingualism will be recognized by institutions like Yale.

Prominently displayed on a shelf in the NACC’s upstairs 
living room is “A Party Game for Indigenant Peoples,” 
known as Cards Against Colonialism. Its battered red box 
is lovingly frayed around the edges, and rests beside a pris-
tine edition of Cards Against Humanity, its fraternal twin. 
It’s easy to tell which one is more popular on game night. 
Next to the card games rests a whiteboard covered in the 
languages of the NACC community, from Cree to Lakȟóta, 
Navajo to Mohawk, Chinese to German. 

While many indigenous students are taking languages 
like Chinese and German to fulfill their language require-
ment, it’s often not their first choice. First-year Madeleine 
Freeman, who is both Choctaw and Chickasaw, studied 
Turkish from the fourth to the tenth grade and will continue 
to take it at Yale to fulfill her language requirement. How-
ever, she says that she would switch to Choctaw in a heart-
beat. She explains that one of the reasons she chose Yale 
was because Choctaw is taught here, and she was unaware 
that she wouldn’t receive credit. Until the rules change, 
she’ll continue to take informal classes through the NALP.

“Choctaw is mine, there’s a personal connection to it,” 
Freeman explains. “It’s a language that needs people to 
speak it, and it’s my duty to speak this language. There’s 
something deeper within myself that I don’t get aside from 
speaking Choctaw.”

Yale offers a smorgasbord of languages for students 
to pick and choose from in its Blue Book, which lists its 
official course offerings for each year. This includes more 
popular courses such as Spanish, French, and Chinese, 
and less highly enrolled languages such as Bosnian-Croa-
tian-Serbian, Coptic, Kiswahili, Sanskrit, Yoruba, and Zulu, 
all of which grant language credit. Yale gets creative in 
order to provide the latter group of languages. Bosnian-Cro-
atian-Serbian, per its course description in Blue Book, is 
taught using distance learning. That entails videoconfer-
encing in a teacher from Columbia University, much like 
how Walker Skypes in to the NACC conference room twice 
a week. 

While Yale has never offered an indigenous or Native 
American language class for credit, it offers support through 
Directed Independent Language Study, or DILS, a program 
that allows students to study languages that Yale doesn’t 
offer. Students can’t get course credit through DILS, but 
they can receive sessions with a language partner twice 
a week and advice from staff at the Center for Language 
Study, or CLS. In the past, DILS has supported students 
interested in learning Choctaw, Inupiaq, Lak Lakȟóta, 
Navajo, Salish, and Tohono O’odham, according to Nelleke 
Van Deusen-School, Director of CLS. While many indige-
nous students opt to take classes through the NALP instead 
because it offers an actual class structure, high demand 
through DILS can bolster petitions for an official language 
class to be offered through Yale. This spring, Yale piloted an 
American Sign Language course in part due to the fact that 
117 students enrolled in its DILS offering over an eight-year 
period.

Getting a language recognized at Yale is no small task.
