he Saybrook Underbrook, a performance space 
in the basement of the college, is unusually packed. 
The crowd spills over from rows of chairs and onto 
the stairs. They’re all waiting for New York Times-featured 
saxophonist Steve Wilson featured with his pianist and friend 
Pete Malinverni. Whispers of anticipation fill the room as the 
performers explain that they will play whatever music speaks 
to them. Malinverni’s feet zealously tap to the beat as his fin-
gers dance around the keys. Wilson carries the rhythm, hold-
ing a prolonged brassy note with impeccable breath control. 
Malinverni jumps from one end of the keys to the next in a 
jumble of complex notes. A woman in the front row is smiling, 
wide-eyed, nodding, entranced by the music, the rhythm and 
energy of the performers. A few rows behind her, a man sits 
with closed eyes, tapping his feet along. This is happening on 
a Saturday night for the annual Yale Jazz Festival, organized 
by student members of the Yale Undergraduate Jazz Collec-
tive — and all in the name of jazz.


The Collective, a nine-member group of undergraduates, 
also brings established jazz musicians like E.J. Strickland and 
Nicholas Payton to Yale for free concerts, hosts jam sessions, 
organizes master classes, and plans the annual three-day Fes-
tival. But despite all it does, the group survives on grants from 
the Dean of Arts and Saybrook College, with no guarantee 
that the funding will continue next year.  	


Founded in 2012, the Undergraduate Jazz Collective has 
become key for students at Yale interested in jazz. When soph-
omore Hersh Gupta arrived at Yale, he had been playing sax-
ophone seriously for years and was excited to play with other 
like-minded musicians. This year, however, only two faculty 
members specialize in the genre, and the School of Music 
offers only two academic courses on jazz. There are only three 
jazz combos, one ensemble, and no private instruction in jazz 
performance. The audience at the Collective’s events spills 
out the door; someone sitting in the crowd might not know 
that these students are going it alone.


n 2015, when the building that houses the ensemble prac-
tice room was closed for renovation, the group’s director 
decided to cease operations for the following year. Frustra-
tion among Yale students boiled over, and word of the contro-
versy spread beyond campus borders: the New York Times pub-
lished an article about the Collective’s dissatisfaction with the 
university’s efforts to teach jazz studies. Dean Robert Blocker, 
Dean of the School of Music, told the Times, “We train peo-
ple in the Western canon and new music,” suggesting that the 
university had space for classical music but not jazz. Blocker 
continued by saying that he was interested in hiring a saxo-
phone teacher, but only if they could teach the classic reper-
tory as well. Yale’s classical music bias is evident in its faculty, 
which is primarily composed of classically-trained musicians, 
and includes degree programs that offer instruction in clas-
sical, chamber and baroque music, but not an official jazz 
studies program.


In July 2016, after the article, Blocker announced on the 
Yale School of Music’s website that the School of Music had 
been offered “an anonymous gift… to continue and expand 
its legacy of jazz studies at Yale.” Out of that gift came the 
Yale Jazz Initiative, a commitment by the School of Music 
to expand the legacy of jazz at Yale. The initiative involved 
bringing in musicians like Grammy-winning saxophonist 
Wayne Escoffery for jazz improv lessons, and opening the

Yale Jazz Ensemble to all Yale students –– not just under-
graduates. But Yale has a long way to go in order to rival peer 
institutions like Harvard, Princeton, and Columbia. Harvard 
has two eighteen-piece ensembles and brings in jazz mas-
ters-in-residence every spring –– this semester, it’s three-time 
Grammy winning Angelique Kidjo. Princeton offers a Certif-
icate in Jazz Studies which requires four jazz courses, partic-
ipation in one of the faculty-led jazz ensembles, and a recital 
performance. Columbia has eight jazz ensembles, including 
a group specializing in Afro-Cuban and Brazilian jazz, and 
it offers thirteen different private jazz instruction courses 
ranging from jazz piano to jazz vibraphone. The Columbia’s 
Music Department’s jazz section boasts the Louis Armstrong 
Jazz Performance program, the Columbia Jazz Composers 
Collective Recording Series, a Jazz Studies Special Con-
centration, and a Jazz House where students “live and jam 
together.” Yale’s website offers a list of members, a schedule 
of events, FAQ and a mostly dormant livestream broadcasting 
performances and sometimes rehearsals. 


Sophomore Nicholas Serrambana, President of the Col-
lective, is an African American Studies major with a music 
concentration. In his view, the lack of institutional support 
for jazz at Yale demonstrates a problem with the university’s 
values. “There is the issue of representation and the canon, 
and a major controversy is that the School of Music made 
a statement saying, ‘Look, we’re only interested in classical 
music and music of the western canon,’” Nicholas says. “Jazz 
is something that people consider quintessentially American. 
It’s interesting [that] that’s something that Yale’s not proud of.”


Daphne Brooks agrees. A professor in African American 
Studies, American Studies, Theater Studies and Women’s, 
Gender and Sexuality Studies, Brooks teaches classes focused 
on jazz and co-leads the Black Sound and the Archive Work-
ing Group, a two-year initiative led by a group that focuses 
on researching and archiving the history and significance 
of African American sonic practices. She aims to facilitate 
more communication between the African American Studies 
department and the Yale School of Music to create a struc-
tured curriculum. “African Americans [have used] music as 
a way to archive their history when they didn’t have access to 
erecting their own institutional archives,” Brooks says. “The 
music was the thing we can use to document our hereness, as 
well as our past, as well our futurity.”


The Yale Jazz Initiative will end in Fall 2019, but the Col-
lective hopes to continue projects like the combo coaching 
program, which brought renowned musicians like saxophonist 
Wayne Escoffery and bassist Jeff Fuller to work with the jazz 
combos. Despite the buzz that the Collective has created, it 
seems that the School of Music does not plan to take on any 
financial or logistical responsibility for its activities. Serram-
bana says that working with Dean of the Arts Kate Krier and 
the Black Sound and the Archive Working Group has been 
helpful, and that his own band has seen how the Collective 
has succeeded in increasing attendance and having more 
inclusive events. He thinks that whether it be through bring-
ing musicians to the Underbrook or putting on a festival, the 
Collective is doing worthwhile work in giving the Yale com-
munity the jazz music that they want to hear, and keeping the 
conversation going.


ne week before the Jazz Festival, the Ensemble holds 
a special joint rehearsal with the nearby Hamden 
Hall Country Day School’s jazz band. As the event 
begins, Melissa Hudson, the band’s smiling director, explains 
how grateful she is to collaborate with the ensemble. A B flat 
resounds through the room as woodwind and brass instru-
ments begin tuning. The notes they attempt mingle in the air 
with small conversation. The sounds eventually devolve into 
a clamor of instruments, then a pause for clarity –– and the 
music begins.  Gupta is focused, poised and secure,  sitting up 
front with the saxophone while Serrambana nods to the beat, 
plucking away in the bass section. Feet tap and eyes close as 
the bands play “Moanin,’” a jazz standard by drummer Art 
Blakey. A Hamden student shakily attempts a drum solo, and 
then watches, wide-eyed, as Yale student Colum O’Connor 
perfects it on his first try. Hudson walks around the room tak-
ing pictures with sheer awe on her face. The Jazz Ensemble 
displays the same soulful energy. It’s impossible to tell that 
some of its members are planning an entire weekend of jazz 
in their heads, and hoping for more.
