he swarthy Hero of Iroas scowled, swept back his 
crimson cape, and put up his fists. Kytheon’s Irregu-
lars drew their swords. The demonic Master of the 
Feast rose on his bat’s wings. Cameron surveyed his army, 
considered his odds, and called for a frontal assault. In that 
moment, I knew that I had him. It was a small mistake: a 
slight overextension of his forces, a bit of cockiness from an 
experienced mage who was certain his amateur adversary 
wouldn’t notice a blunder. But this was Magic: The Gather-
ing — a trading card game where victory is often decided by 
the smallest of margins. Even a small mistake could be fatal.

We were in Elm City Games, the city’s haven for Magic. 
When the first edition of the game was released in 1993, it 
was merely a fast-paced alternative to traditional roleplaying 
games such as Dungeons and Dragons, but now the most 
valuable Magic cards fetch prices as high as $27,000, the best 
players sometimes live off their tournament earnings, and the 
game’s dilettantes number more than twenty million around 
the world. On many Friday and Saturday nights, ECG 
becomes what Brandon Patton, a frequent patron, calls an 
“oasis for misfits” –– a gathering place for professionals who 
take a trading card game far too seriously and for amateurs 
entranced by the metal mountains of Mirrodin, the vam-
pire-infested bogs of Innistrad, and the shoguns of Kamigawa.

My opponent was, at once, an aspiring doctor who played 
Magic with surgical precision and a mighty wizard called a 
planeswalker who could call on both the pure mana of the 
steppe and the necromancy of the swamp. Cameron was mus-
cular, collected, confident –– not at all like the gangly gamers 
who usually frequent comic book stores and play Magic only 
after abandoning more macho pastimes such as Trivial Pur-
suit or Dungeons and Dragons. I had just watched him dis-
member his last opponent, dominating two games before I 
had finished one. I hadn’t played seriously in three years –– 
Magic doesn’t easily fit into a Yale schedule  –– and Cameron 
must have sensed my ineptness before we even began play-
ing, simply from the clumsy way I shuffled my deck of cards. 
But none of that mattered anymore. I knew that I had him.

I drew a card, summoned a Seismic Elemental, then 
pushed all four of my creatures forward: the dragon, the ele-
mental, and the two goblins  –– too many for him to block with 
three of his creatures recovering from their recent charge and 
enough to finish him if they all landed their attacks. Silence 
hung over the table. And for the first time that night, I saw 
the Magic –– not the cards on the table, not the two young 
men craned over them in a noisy store smelling of fresh paint 
and body odor, but instead the two planeswalkers facing off 
on opposite ends of a charred steppe, the dragon with iron 
scales burning a hole in the dark sky, the elemental burrow-
ing under the earth, the junior wizard inspecting his forces 
with a triumphant smirk, and the senior wizard clutching his 
staff, mumbling a futile counter-spell, his expression dazed, 
disbelieving, defeated.

Smiling slightly, Cameron reached out over the table, 
pointed to Kytheon’s Irregulars, and told me he was tapping 
my dragon.
“You’re what?” I said, glancing nervously at the irregulars. 
“I’m tapping your dragon,” he repeated. And there it was: a 
thin line of unremarkable text on the Kytheon’s Irregulars 
card that I had entirely forgotten. For two white mana, he 
could put any of my creatures to sleep. My dragon, overcome 
by a bout of uncharacteristic fatigue, fell out of the sky and 
decided to take a nap. 

My two goblins and my elemental, now leaderless, 
threw their pathetic spears and boulders at the opposing 
planeswalker. And then Cameron’s demon darkened the sky


and his irregulars stormed over the plain and he had me.

The game was over, the Magic was broken, and I leaned 
back from the table, biting my lip. At least I had made it 
close. The next game was not close. At times I found my eyes 
drifting away from the card table to the store surrounding us. 
It was a game shop on Chapel Street, not far from the Green, 
with the convivial atmosphere of a secluded café. It had high 
ceilings, round playing tables, and row after row of board 
games, bags of twenty-sided die, and roleplaying rulebooks 
for Pathfinder, Dark Heresy, and three separate editions of 
Dungeons and Dragons lining the walls.

Elm City Games opened a little over two years ago. Trish 
Loter and Matt Fantastic, its two owners, make a strong effort 
to promote a welcoming culture. “Magic, for us, is a pas-
sion, a labor of love,” Loter told me. “We don’t make a lot 
of money from Magic –– it’s one of our smallest margins. 
We do it because we like it.” On this night, there were only 
four of us in the store: Cameron, myself, a longtime player 
named Anthony (experienced enough to lose to Cameron 
stoically), and a new player named Robert, who angrily for-
feited his game against Cameron on the third turn, stormed 
away, and declared that playing against him was “like trying 
to arm-wrestle with Mr. T.”

Mr. T smiled at me good-naturedly after pinning my arm 
in the second game. A match was best two-out-of-three, so we 
were finished, and in the lull that followed I found myself 
thinking for the first time that night about the problem sets 
I had to finish, and the book I had to read, and the article 
I had to write by Sunday. Cameron turned back to me and 
suggested we play another game with different decks. He is 
a medical student at Quinnipiac and doubtless had unwrit-
ten papers and unstudied flashcards in his world as well. But 
on this evening, he was not in that world. On this evening, 
he and I were planeswalkers –– powerful mages who were 
never tired or dispirited, who could flit effortlessly between 
alien realms, who had scoffed at the false gods of Theros and 
overpowered the titanic Eldrazi of Zendikar. Relaxing again, 
I drew my seven cards, considered my options, and told Cam-
eron I was playing a Goblin Lackey.
