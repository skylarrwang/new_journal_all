THE SHIPPING NEWS
What will an expansion of the Port of New Haven mean for the workers 
down at the docks?

ichael Vasaturo leads me through maritime 
fog that covers the Port of New Haven one cool 
March morning. The cranes of the bulk freighter 
Cyrenaica G. loom in the blurry distance. As the short, 
gold-necklaced Vasaturo and I walk along the wharf of New 
Haven Terminal (NHT), the shipping company where he 
serves as executive director, he describes a project poised 
to change the future of the local shipping industry. “The 
biggest thing that’s going on right now is trying to dredge,” 
he tells me, referencing a joint initiative of the New Haven 
Port Authority, the Connecticut Port Authority, and the 
Army Corps of Engineers to deepen the shipping chan-
nel from thirty-five to at least forty feet. The managers of 
the Port’s seven other terminal companies share Vasaturo’s 
enthusiasm. In his large, dark office, Vasaturo tells me they 
all benefit if the port develops. “We all want dredging,” he 
says, as we look across the wharf. By ‘all,’ Vasaturo means 
his executive colleagues at the Port’s six other terminal 
companies, all of whom are involved in planning the devel-
opment. Less clear, at least in this conversation, are the 
wishes of the terminal employees, repairing machinery and 
loading trucks in the yard below.


The East Coast shipping industry is changing in step 
with a globalized world. Soon, a widened Panama Canal 
will give larger ships from East Asia access to East Coast 
ports like New York and Norfolk. As these shipping cen-
ters expand, “the smaller ships are going to get priced out,” 
Tommy Seda, a former tugboat mate at Gateway Termi-
nal, believes. But if these vessels can’t compete with larger 
boats at the region’s biggest terminals, Seda thinks there’s 
another option: “What better place to go than just good old 
New Haven, right down the street?”

Seda’s comment captures New Haven’s position in a 
Northeastern industrial hierarchy. The city knows that it’s 
no New York, where, Vasaturo reflects, “there’s always ves-
sels in the port, because they supply all the big companies, 
all the Walmarts, the Targets, the fruit people.” But manag-
ers like Vasaturo and Evan Matthews, Director of the Con-
necticut Port Authority, want it to benefit from the same 
global trends that make New York prosper. New Haven will 
never be New York, but it can fill the regional niches its 
neighbor leaves vacant. “Once the channel gets deepened 
to forty feet, it’ll be on par with Providence, Boston,” Mat-
thews says over the phone. “It’ll be a deep-water port that’ll 
help all those companies compete with cargo.” 
The future of the port looks different from the ground. 
Cut off from the city by locked fences, security guards, rail-
road tracks, and I-95, this industrial ecosystem goes largely 
unnoticed. But on the distant eastern shore of the New 
Haven Harbor, a legion of terminals and tugboats form the 
fifty-third largest port in the U.S. Out of New Haven flow 
gravel and scrap metal, towering in one hundred-foot piles 
on Gateway Terminal’s property. Much more enters than 
leaves –– imports include seventy percent of Connecticut’s 
petroleum. “In terms of petroleum, New Haven may be 
one of the largest ports on the East Coast,” Vasaturo spec-
ulates, as we pass fields of circular white fuel tanks and 
sprawling pipe lattices.


Although the Port of New Haven fuels the city’s fifty 
thousand trade, transportation, and utilities jobs, it operates 
under particular and demanding labor rules. The erratic 
nature of shipping in a small port like New Haven requires 
many workers to structure their employment around irregu-
lar gigs. “It’s a pretty well-synchronized operation, because 
time is –– everything is –– about production,” Vasaturo 
says. There’s a lot of production at stake. Ninety percent 
of global trade is carried over the sea in bulk freighters, 
container ships, and tankers. At New Haven, unlike the 
constantly busy Port of New York, this trade comes in fits 
and starts. While petroleum is, according to Vasaturo, “a 
pretty regular business,” the arrival of ships carrying dry 
cargo is negotiated by agents of the terminal company and 
the shipping company, and based on local demand. “They 
were very busy with vessels last week, you know, unload-
ing steel,” Vasaturo says, pointing to an empty barge sitting 
one wharf over, at a terminal owned by NHT and leased 
by another company he declined to name for confidenti-
ality reasons. Until regional manufacturers run out of steel 
coil and the agents reconnect, no one knows when the next 
barge will arrive.


At the Port of New Haven, because of the unpredict-
able work cycle, terminals find ways to pay workers only 
when they’re needed. Vasaturo describes the composition 
of NHT’s workforce before the company left the dry cargo 
business. “There were the people that worked full time, 
what we call our terminal workers,” Vasaturo explains, “and 
they loaded trucks and managed the warehouse.” The neon-
clad men welding to loud rock music in a tool-crammed, 
tin-roofed shed at the base of the NHT wharf were terminal 
workers. “And then there were what you would call tradi-
tional stevedores, and they would only work when there 
were vessels.” When NHT handled dry cargo, they’d call 
in stevedores, the men responsible for getting cargo off the 
ships and onto the wharf, and pay them until the unloading 
was finished. Many of these workers belonged to the Inter-
national Longshoremen’s Association, the AFL-CIO union 
for stevedores working on the East Coast, from Canada 
to Puerto Rico. The ILA in New Haven disbanded in the 
mid-2000s, and all Port workers are currently non-union, 
full-time employees of the terminal companies. Full-time, 
however, doesn’t necessarily mean all the time.   


“I was used to it,” says Seda, who until 2017 was a full-
time employee of Gateway Terminal, of his intermittent 
work schedule. “But it’s hard when you have kids at home.” 
While Vasaturo works on the dry-land, business end of the

industry, the tall, soft-spoken Seda has spent his life on the 
water. He came up “through the hawsepipe,” starting off as 
a volunteer deckhand at fourteen, learning on the job, and 
climbing his way up to officer. After years of captaining tall 
ships –– old commercial sailing vessels –– at New York’s 
South Street Seaport Museum, Seda moved to New Haven 
in 2013. For a year, he captained the schooner Quinnipiac, 
then docked at Long Wharf and owned by the educational 
nonprofit Schooner Inc.  
Seda was the last captain of the Quinnipiac before finan-
cial troubles forced Schooner Inc. to sell it off. Afterwards, 
he used some connections in the small maritime world 
to land a job at Gateway. Despite his captain’s rank, Seda 
started out as a deckhand on the Gateway tugs. Once he 
took some classes and got a towing license, he got promoted 
to mate. “The guys on the tugboats work a two-week long 
schedule, so they show up on the tug and live on the tug 
for two weeks,” he explains. They’d get paid during the two 
weeks on, but not during the two weeks off, during which 
Seda would travel with his wife and take part-time jobs in 
construction and ship maintenance. During his on-weeks, 
there was usually maintenance work to be done, even if no 
vessels were entering the harbor. “They’re steel tugs,” Seda 
says, “so all they want to do is rust. It’s a constant battle 
against rust.” It was only once “in a very blue moon” that 
there wasn’t enough work and Gateway would tell its tug 
workers, some of whom flew in from Florida or drove down 
from Maine, not to come in for their two-week shifts. 


Even given the weeks without pay, Seda is gracious to 
his former employer, telling me that Gateway tries to avoid 
leaving workers without jobs and provides full benefits. He 
describes New Haven’s shipping industry as a relatively 
prosperous, fraternal environment, largely free of conflict 
between workers and companies, despite the turbulence of 
the workforce. “[In] such a small industry, there’s plenty of 
work to go around, so there’s no need to be that competi-
tive,” Seda says.


Vasaturo describes collaboration at higher levels of the 
industry. “Everybody knows everybody,” he says of the 
terminal companies and managers. To Vasaturo, the ami-
cability comes from a shared desire to make the Port as 
regionally competitive and productive as possible. Dredg-
ing and other infrastructure projects, regardless of how they 
affect workers, may keep the port relevant as trade patterns 
change. 


Of the three ports in Connecticut –– New Haven, New 
London, and Bridgeport –– New Haven is the only one that 
is neither diminutive nor in a state of decline. The incon-
sistency and infrastructure requirements of the shipping 
industry have taken a toll. “There used to be a stevedoring 
terminal in Bridgeport,” Vasaturo tells me frankly, “but it’s 
not open for stevedoring anymore.” New Haven has seen 
some trouble, too. NHT went bankrupt in 1994, and sub-
sequently abandoned dry cargo shipping. “When we came 
out of bankruptcy in 1996, we looked at the best way for our 
company to rebuild, and it was to lease out and not be the 
operator of the cargo business,” Vasaturo says.


Matthews, the Port Authority Director, hopes to 
strengthen New Haven’s dry cargo business, and in the pro-
cess reduce the number of trucks leaving the Port of New 
York and crowding the I-95 on their way to Connecticut.  
The Port Authority is currently battling the Connecticut 
Department of Transportation over some parcels of land 
on the Port grounds, and if they win this extra space, he 
may want to add specialized terminals to handle contain-
