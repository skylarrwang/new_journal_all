Connecticut’s roller derby community bashes heads and bucks gender norms.

Krazy Legz Nikki is barreling down a flat track 
in quad skates, looking for Your Mom. Your 
Mom, a blocker, has a decision to make: she can 
either help Legz, her jammer, carve through a glut of 
skate-wearing women, or she can get in the way of the 
opposing jammer, Sass Squash. To make it through 
unscathed, Legz will have to “dance by” Lehigh Valley’s 
blockers using the precise footwork she’s been practicing 
since 2012. Or she can just barrel right through.
“We prefer just running people over, in all honesty,” 
Legz admits after the bout. 
I drive to the Connecticut Roller Derby Travel Team 
Double-Header (one match between the CT All-Stars 
and Lehigh Valley, the other between the CT Yankee 
Brutals and Shoreline Bella Donnas), fully expecting 
to be one of maybe thirty or forty spectators. But when 
I arrive at the Insports Center in Trumbull, Connecticut, the parking lot is full, and I am forced into parking 
behind a caravan of cars down the street. After ten minutes waiting in line for a ticket, I am greeted by a maple 
hardwood floor the size of three basketball courts, two 
commentators, an elaborate sound system, and a projection screen displaying the score. Dozens of vendors line 
the gym and hundreds of people—from grandchildren 
to grandparents—sit around the track in home-brought 
portable chairs brought from home. I didn’t realize this 
was BYOC.
I sit close to the track in an area called “The Danger 
Zone.” You must be eighteen to sit here because there’s 
a possibility that one of the roller girls will careen off the 
track and crush you and your ice-cold Coors Lite. Before 
I have time to evaluate the risk of my seating location, 
the buzzer sounds and the bout begins. Eight women, 
all wearing skates, knee pads, elbow pads, and helmets, 
begin bodying each other for position. Two skaters, one 
from each team, fly around the back straightaway. The 
crowd rumbles in their portable chairs. Perhaps this is 
not such a niche sport after all. 	
In 1935, roller derby was basically a cross country 
endurance race. Teams of two would circle around a 
banked track over and over, covering three thousand 
miles in total, approximately the distance from New 
York City to Los Angeles. After realizing crowds enjoyed 
the collisions more than the skating, Leo Seltzer, the 
sport’s founder, tweaked the game to add more physical 
contact. It took off.  By 1949, the National Roller Derby 
playoffs sold out Madison Square Garden for an entire 
week, and the sport was broadcast on CBS. When that 
contract expired, ABC started televising games. But by 
the early nineteen-seventies, the sport sputtered out. The 
1973 oil crisis made it prohibitively expensive for teams 
to travel, and the Roller Games’ International Skating 
Conference’s uncompetitive, circus-like approach to the 
game turned off fans. 
In 2000, Daniel Eduardo Policarpo, also known as 
“Devil Dan,” attempted to re-ignite the sport as an all-
women roller derby-themed spectacle with winners 
selected before the match. After a highly suspect logistical meeting in a bar, the recruited women decided to 
ditch Dan and form their own organization: Bad Girl 
Good Woman Productions. They changed the rules and 
formed a league. Winners would no longer be pre-ordained. Now it wasn’t just a show; it was a competition. 
And it wasn’t “women’s roller derby” –– it was just roller 
derby. (Men’s derby exists, but it’s not nearly as popular. 
For men, there’s a wider range of highly physical, competitive outlets to choose from. Roller Derby is also one 
of the only sports that allow trans athletes to compete 
as women without undergoing hormone therapy, distinguishing it from any Olympic event.) The sport continues to grow in popularity. In 2006, the CT Roller Derby 
began with about fifteen skaters. Now they have about 
sixty-five. 
“We have moms, we have younger women, we have 
older women, we have cis women, we have trans women,” 
Your Mom, also known as Nolan Smith, tells me. “We 
have every race and age you could think of. Everybody 
has a home here.”
Roller derby consists of two thirty-minute halves, each 
broken up into two-minute sections called jams. Each 
team plays with five athletes at a time, and there are two 
main positions: jammer and blocker. The jammer’s goal 
is to score, which she does by weaving through a horde 
of blockers and lapping members of the opposing team. 
Blockers, four on each squad, play offense and defense at 
the same time. They help their jammer get through the 
pack and prevent the other team’s jammer from doing 
the same. At the end of each jam, new jammers and 
blockers switch onto the track.
The game shifts between fast and slow. All-Star jammer Black Cherry weaves, hops, and sprints through 
small holes in the Lehigh Valley defense. Legz looks for 
an opening and pile-drives through. At times, the jammer gets stuck behind a wall of opposing blockers. When 
Black Cherry hops over a defender’s outstretched leg, the 
crowd cheers. 
About ten years ago, the sport was high-speed and 
punk-rock. Players drank beer before matches, wore fishnet tights, and pummeled each other. Roller Derby was 
little more than flying around the track and laying hits. 
Derby names –– Your Mom, Krazy Legz Nikki, Puke 
Skywalker –– are a carryover from this campy era. 
“For a long time it was just skate fast, turn left,” Smith 
says. “It was never a show, it was never pretend … but 
over time it’s changed from a game where people go as 
fast as they can to a game with strategies and formations.”
Today, players treat the game more seriously. The CT 
All-Stars practice three days a week, two hours each day. 
They practice formations and watch tape. Athletes on the 
All-Stars are also expected to cross-train outside of practice –– weight lifting, running, core workouts. If you’re 
not strong, you’re more likely to sprain an ankle, break 
a clavicle, or tear an ACL. Almost every athlete I talk 
to, from Scorin’ Kierkegaard to Midwife Crisis, has an 
injury story; during the match, I notice All-Star Captain 
Puke Skywalker standing on the sideline with a walker. 
The bout ends with a score of 287–153, a convincing 
All-Star win. But they’re not done for the day. After they 
change out of their game uniforms, they’ve got other jobs 
to do. Some coach the B-team, the Yankee Brutals. Others walk around the court selling raffle tickets to keep the 
nonprofit club afloat. Players, refs, coaches, announcers, 
and staff are all volunteers. 
Holding a jug of 50/50 raffle tickets amidst the noisy 
crowd, Krazy Legz Nikki finds some time to talk. “So 
you’re gonna write about how awesome we are? On and 
off the track? Should I put my hair down and try to fluff it 
up? Don’t mention the sweat—or the pops and bruises.” 
She points out a welt on her shoulder that seems to 
become darker each minute I talk to her. “This one’s 
gonna be good if you want a picture of that.”
