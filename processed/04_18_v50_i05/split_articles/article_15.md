The process begins when CLS considers a proposal and 
consults with the department that would offer the language. 
Next, CLS assesses demand and requests resources from the 
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean’s Office. If resources are 
approved, the Course of Study Committee approves individ-
ual pilot courses so that Yale can see if they can offer enough 
levels in the language to fulfill the language requirement. 
The full program then goes before a vote of Yale College 
faculty, completing the process.


Currently, students within the NACC are actively peti-
tioning CLS for language classes, continuing efforts from 
years past. While faculty members in the department were 
hesitant to comment on the issue, Vee Cangiano, Coordi-
nator of DILS, cites the relatively low demand. According to 
Cangiano, the number of students taking ASL over the last 
eight years was “two to three times the demand for all Native 
American languages combined.” 


Another concern expressed by administrators is the 
dearth of college-level textbooks and curriculum for indige-
nous languages. Organizations such as the Lakota Language 
Consortium, or LLC, are working to address this issue. LLC 
is a nonprofit working to revitalize the Lakȟóta language 
through writing textbooks, producing curricula, and offer-
ing summer immersion programs. They have helped uni-
versities like the Universities of North and South Dakota set 
up their Lakȟóta language departments and are reworking a 
textbook for the postsecondary level. 


“It’s an American value to give everyone the right to 
decide for themselves, but this right was never given to 
Native Americans,” said Wilhelm Meya, Chairman of the 
Lakota Language Consortium. “They were here before 
the Europeans and had over five hundred languages spo-
ken alongside histories, cultures, and prayers that were all 
embedded within their languages. Nearly a hundred years 
of institutionalized policies forced them to conform to 
English. No one is going to deny the power and utility of 
English, but you can’t take away the right to their indige-
nous language from them.”


For some indigenous students, the university’s failure to 
grant credit for Native languages adds insult to injury: many 
of them come from under-resourced schools that can’t offer 
foreign language classes. On the Rocky Boy Indian Reser-
vation, Blatt says, her high school only had ten teachers 
spread over 120 high school students. As such, there weren’t 
enough teachers for her high school to offer foreign lan-
guage courses. Pourier says that while indigenous students 
are “anything but a single story,” those who grew up on res-
ervations often deal with culture shock alongside the usual 
demands made of Yale students. As a result of centuries of 
colonial policies enacted by the U.S. government, Native 
American communities are some of the poorest in the 
nation –– Pine Ridge Reservation has an 80 percent unem-
ployment rate, according to Al-Jazeera.


Unlike Pourier, Blatt didn’t start self-studying her native 
language, Cree, until getting to Yale. As she sits cross-legged 
on the wine-colored armchair in our common room, she 
explains that her mother attended an Indian boarding 
school with the mantra “Kill the Indian, Save the Man.” As 
such, her mother was hesitant when Gabriella began join 
Facebook groups like “Cree Simon Says,” which offers one 
hour lessons each day through Facebook Live. 


“On the reservation, I was surrounded by my culture,” 
Blatt said. “Coming here made me realize how important 
it is to hold onto what I have. My culture is dying, and my 
refusal to learn something as simple as the language is a 
contribution to the death of it,” she explains. 


Later that night, under the chandeliers of the Branford 
dining hall, Pourier explains to me that in the Lakȟóta 
nation, they don’t refer to it as “learning” their language. 
Rather, they call it “remembering.” He explains that mem-
bers of his tribe see the language as part of their spirit, built 
into their genetic code. Speaking is merely the body catch-
ing up, remembering what has been lost.


He sits up, gesturing across the table at Rosales. “When-
ever I speak Lakȟóta, it’s my spirit speaking to Jacob’s spirit. 
Whenever I speak English, it’s my body speaking to Jacob’s 
body. The ancestors’ spirits back home hear us, and they 
know we are out here.” He smiles, tugging on the strings of 
his pink hoodie. “They know that we are not lost. Whenever 
we speak Lakȟóta, it’s as if we are home.”

“Coming here made me realize how 
important it is to hold onto what I have. 
My culture is dying, and my refusal to 
learn something as simple as the lan-
guage is a contribution to the death of 
it,” Blatt said.

“It’s an American value to give every-
one the right to decide for themselves, 
but this right was never given to Native 
Americans,” said Wilhelm Meya, Chair-
man of the Lakota Language Consortium.
