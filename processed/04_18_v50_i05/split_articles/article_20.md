his vote, the crowd broke into a chant: “Shame on you!” 
Despite the outcry, the vote went as expected: three votes 
for Brown, four for Birks. With the Board’s decision made, 
Birks started work this March.
What created such animus towards Birks? The answer, 
in part, has to do with charter schools. Unlike traditional 
public schools, which typically operate under the local 
Board of Education and follow state education laws, 
charter schools are operated by independent organiza-
tions that craft their own “charters,” or sets of standards; 
the charter must be renewed periodically by the local or 
state Board. While both traditional public schools and 
charter schools are publicly funded, charter schools can 
set their own curricula. Proponents argue that charter 
schools provide the flexibility to promote much-needed 
experimentation in the classroom. Skeptics view them as 
a threat to public school systems, contending that they 
encroach upon funding streams, weaken teachers’ unions, 
and elude accountability to local government. Some 
advocates of traditional public schools fear that charter 
schools’ end goal is to compete –– rather than collaborate 
–– with established school systems.
At a community forum in November, Birks expressed 
the most openness towards charter schools of the three 
final candidates. She argued for a collaborative approach, 
telling the audience, “We shouldn’t fight charter schools; 
we should learn from them.” A story in the New Haven 
Independent that highlighted the comment further dam-
aged Birks’ reputation. She had already been scrutinized 
for her past employment at two for-profit education con-
sulting firms and her membership of a charter school 
board in Hartford, according to Carlos Torre, who sat on 
the New Haven Board of Education for more than twen-
ty-two of the past twenty-four years until his term ended 
this January, and voted against Birks. (Birks could not be 
reached for comment.)
More broadly, detractors feared that Birks wouldn’t 
relate well to New Haven’s students. She had only three 
years of teaching experience, and stepped down after one 
year as principal of Harding High School in Bridgeport 
as the school struggled with poor test scores and high sus-
pension rates, then took a job with Global Partnership 
Schools, the management firm hired to turn the school 
around. On that November night at Beecher School, Jacob 
Spell and Makayla Dawkins, the Board’s two non-voting 
student representatives, presented a list of eight hundred 
signatures, collected from students at Hillhouse, Career, 
and Co-Op high schools, all in opposition to Birks. As 
the Board’s discussion devolved into jeers and interrup-
tions, Spell and Dawkins stood up from the table and left. 
They, like the student protesters in the back of the audito-
rium, had their mouths effectively taped shut. “It seemed 
so disempowering,” said Sarah Miller, a local education 
advocate whose two children attend New Haven public 
schools. “You bring in these candidates, you ask kids what 
they want, and then you ignore them.”
Now, New Haven’s schools are at a crossroads. What 
role will charter schools will play in the district, and what 
does their approach mean for students? Along with the 
sixty public schools run by the district, the city has seven 
charter schools that enroll 2,500 students –– close to 10 
percent of the district’s total student population. Three 
of New Haven’s most innovative schools –– two charter 
schools, Achievement First Amistad High School and 
Common Ground High School, and one magnet school, 
Metropolitan Business Academy –– are, in essence, 
playing tug-of-war with the district’s future. If one of the 
supposed benefits of charter schools is that they enable 
experimentation, this raises the question: What does edu-
cational innovation look like in practice? What are the 
benefits and pitfalls of granting schools individual auton-
omy? And is this same kind of innovation possible outside 
of charter schools? At the heart of these questions lie the 
district’s students: their future depends on the answers.

Climbing the Mountain
E
very morning in high school, Arese Uwuo-
ruya and Sebastian Quiñonez got up at 6 
a.m. and put on their uniforms: a white or 
light blue button down, khakis, a tie for Quiñonez. 
They walked into a building whose exterior –– white 
and light-blue tiles above khaki-colored stones –– 
matched their outfits, topped by a frieze depicting 
Black luminaries: Marian Wright Edelman, Maya 
Angelou, Thurgood Marshall. They went to Advisory 
–– similar to homeroom –– at the start and end of 
each day.
As the Board’s discussion devolved into jeers and 
interruptions, Spell and Dawkins stood up from the table 
and left. They, like the student protestors in the back of 
the auditorium, had their mouths effectively taped shut.

At Advisory on Thursday afternoons, Uwuoruya and 
Quiñonez received “paychecks”: scorecards document-
ing their behavior for the week. Merits were awarded for 
positive contributions to class: an insightful comment, a 
demonstration of creative thinking. Demerits were doled 
out for distracting or disrespectful behavior. On the pay-
check, points were added and subtracted from a base mark 
of one hundred. A well-behaved student might score close 
to two hundred, earning the privilege of attending school 
out of uniform that Friday. A disobedient student might 
receive a much lower score (say, –4) and would have to 
come to school in blue and khaki as usual.
Uwuoruya and Quiñonez attended Achievement First 
Amistad High School, a charter school located on Dixwell 
Avenue, before graduating in 2016. (Now, they are both 
sophomores at Yale). Achievement First is a “charter man-
agement organization,” or CMO: an umbrella nonprofit, 
operating a network of thirty-four charter schools. It runs 
five of the seven charter schools in New Haven, enroll-
ing a total of just over two thousand students. Every five 
years, the state Board of Education reviews and reautho-
rizes these schools. At a typical Achievement First school, 
over 98 percent of students are Black or Latinx, and over 
three-quarters qualify for free or reduced lunch.
The organization’s name is a proxy for its philosophy. 
Achievement is the guiding tenet of each school, and 
data the prism through which accomplishment is assessed 
and interpreted. “Behind every data point is a student, 
a family, a teacher,” the organization’s website reads. At 
Achievement First schools, teachers meet weekly with  a 
“coach,” typically their department’s dean, to review their 
lessons. These meetings revolve around metrics. “The 
data is what drives the decisions for kids,” said Fatimah 
Barker, Achievement First’s Chief External Officer, who 
has worked with the network as a teacher, principal, and 
administrator for over a decade. “Seventy to eighty per-
cent of the coaching meeting is about data.” Teachers 
administer standardized weekly quizzes to students at all 
thirty-four schools through a system called the Student 
Work Protocol, and students complete one- or two-ques-
tion “exit tickets” at the end of each class, providing the 
scores that fuel this achievement-based approach.
At Achievement First’s high schools, this rigor extends 
to the college application process. In all four grades, stu-
dents take a college-prep course, setting long-term goals, 
learning to write a college essay, and preparing for inter-
views. Teachers guide students through the Common 
Application and help low-income students with the Free 
Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). This sup-
port continues beyond each day’s final bell. When Uwuo-
ruya attended Amistad, the school provided brownies and 
chicken wings at after-school study sessions. Two years 
later, she still receives emails from a guidance counselor 
at Amistad about fellowships and job opportunities. Every 
year, the college acceptance rate for graduating Amistad 
seniors is 100 percent.
Amistad’s academic approach –– the emphasis on data 
in teacher evaluations, the curricular coordination across 
dozens of schools, the institutionalized support through-
out the college process –– is enabled by its status as a char-
ter school. Since teachers at charter schools aren’t union 
members, Amistad can create its own evaluation system. 
And Amistad has the autonomy to establish its own cur-
riculum, driven by data and devoted to preparing students 
for college.
Amistad’s charter school status provides other advan-
tages that may artificially bolster the school’s stellar scores. 
Though students are admitted through a blind lottery, 
Amistad doesn’t accept transfer students after October 1 
–– so, for instance, when the district admitted 250 Puerto 
Rican students displaced by Hurricane Maria last fall, 
most of whom require additional language support, they 
all entered non-charter public schools, according to Jason 
Bartlett, Mayor Harp’s Liaison to the Board of Education.
The hallways at Amistad are lined with banners embla-
zoned with inspirational slogans: “We have the hard-
est working students in Connecticut” and “We need to 
climb the mountain to college.” That second banner, to 
Quiñonez, was symbolic of a lifelong journey. His family 
immigrated to the United States from Ecuador when he 
was five years old; to support his parents, he often works at 
their restaurant, New Haven Salad Shop.
Quiñonez felt he benefited from his time at Amistad. 
But to him, the merit system was oppressive; time and 
time again, he got demerits for dropping his pencil in 
class. “The merit system can easily be distorted or hybrid-
ized into a paternal disciplinary action,” he said. “Every-
body hates the culture it creates. That’s why people are 
like, you’re going back to hell, you’re going back to jail.” 
Quiñonez said that although he was a straight-A student, 
he got two weeks of detention within the first month 
nearly every year at Amistad, forcing him to miss soccer 
practices and games. He was often pulled out of his classes 
for disciplinary proceedings.
At the heart of these questions lie 
the district’s students: their future 
depends on the answers.

The system permeated the school’s atmosphere. “It cre-
ated this weird culture of silence where we wouldn’t say 
anything in class to avoid getting demerits at the end of 
the week, rather than speaking up and becoming one of 
the kids the teachers had their eye on,” Uwuoruya said. “It 
felt ridiculous the way some kids were policed.” In May 
2016, during Uwuoruya and Quiñonez’s last semester, 
frustration with the system bubbled over as hundreds of 
Amistad students staged a schoolwide walkout to protest 
what they deemed a culture of racial insensitivity and a 
lack of faculty diversity.
Amistad responded by increasing recruitment of faculty 
of color and using internal surveys to ensure that faculty 
of color felt happy and supported. Asked whether the 
walkout led to changes in the merit system, administrators 
demurred. “The way we handle school culture, it’s not dis-
cipline on an island, it’s all the stuff that goes into making 
a school strong,” said Amanda Pinto, Achievement First’s 
Director of Communications. “That’s something that’s 
always evolving and changing.”
Like its curriculum, Amistad’s discipline system might 
only be possible to enact in a charter school. In the school 
year that followed the walkout, 25.5 percent of students 
at the three Amistad Academy schools received at least 
one in-school or out-of-school suspension, compared to 
6.9 percent of students in New Haven’s traditional pub-
lic schools. The merit system is shifting. Thirty-eight per-
cent of the faculty at Achievement First’s five New Haven 
schools are Black, Latinx, or multi-racial, and suspension 
rates have declined more than fifty percent in the last two 
years. Still, without intervention by the district, it took stu-
dent outcry to change this culture.
Many of Connecticut’s charter schools are standalone 
institutions. But Amistad, as one member of a larger, 
CMO-operated network, exerts a different kind of influ-
ence on New Haven’s public school system. Since the 
network’s first school was founded in 1999, Achievement 
First has expanded rapidly. To Mark Waxenberg, a former 
President of the Connecticut Educators’ Association, the 
state’s largest teacher’s union, who helped write Connect-
ictut’s charter school law in 1996, this expansion of char-
ter school networks poses a threat to traditional public 
schools. Charter management organizations are “trying to 
create a private system,” he alleged, “but have the public 
pay for it.”
In December 2014, six thousand people clad in neon 
shirts that read “For Every Child” flooded the New Haven 
Green. The rally, emceed by Ben Cruse, the principal of 
a Hartford Achievement First school, was organized by 
ConnCAN, a pro-charter lobbying organization. Speak-
ers urged the state to help the forty thousand students 
“trapped” in its “failing schools.” The rally kicked off an 
ad campaign by Families for Excellent Schools (FES), a 
New York-based pro-charter lobbying organization that 
shut down in February. In one commercial, a series of stu-
dents stare into the camera, praising their schools, before 
the screen cuts to black. “Forty thousand Connecticut stu-
dents would answer very differently,” the narrator reads, 
“trapped in schools where they don’t learn to read, write, 
or do math at grade level.” The ad cuts to a shot of a girl 
holding her mother’s hand, staring nervously up at the 
camera behind a set of iron bars.
The rally and ensuing campaign stoked fears among tra-
ditional public school advocates that charter school net-
works like Achievement First, with the backing of groups 
like ConnCAN, sought to create an alternative school 
system that would drive public schools out of existence. 
Today, Achievement First administrators deny this intent. 
“In my ideal world, we would be hand-in-hand with tra-
ditional public schools,” said Barker, the Chief External 
Officer, noting Achievement First’s open source curricu-
lum and its incubator program for aspiring public school 
administrators as two efforts to collaborate outside of the 
organization’s network. “There’s a ton of myths getting in 
the way of our partnership, thinking that we are here as 
a threat when we’re just here to serve communities that 
have been historically underserved.”
But to Waxenberg, charter school networks like 
Achievement First, with dozens of schools across the 
Northeast, have fundamentally deviated from the intent 
of the original Connecticut charter school law he helped 
write. “We wanted to create what we called ‘incubators of 
innovation,’” he said. “It was really to create a laboratory 
… within the public school structure to use to help reform 
public education across the state.” He feels that charter 
management organizations like Achievement First com-
pete with traditional public schools in Connecticut, and 
have shared their ideas only after forceful prodding.

After Connecticut’s charter law was established in 
“We wanted to create what we 
called ‘incubators of innovation.’”
