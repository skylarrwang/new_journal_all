W
hen New Haven’s twenty-five thousand stu-
dents sit down at their desks, the education 
they get in each of the city’s sixty-seven schools 
is a product of both policies and priorities. The former 
component, policies, raises concrete questions (“close-
ended,” a teacher might say). Would a charter school be 
able to keep up its test scores if it had to accept transfer 
students midyear? Doubtful. Could a traditional public 
school overhaul its curriculum at the drop of a hat? Prob-
ably not. Can a magnet school eliminate tracked courses 
and ignore standardized testing, throwing conventional 
pedagogy to the winds? Yes, but it’s hard to pull off.


The problem of priorities forces teachers and admin-
istrators to ask more abstract questions, about ideals and 
values. Given a school’s limited funding, will it invest in 
computers or art classes? When a student speaks out of 
turn in class, will the teacher scold or engage? Faced with 
a critique of her pedagogy, will a principal look to another 
school for advice or turn the other way? These questions 
define the kind of community a school creates and inform 
the way its students grow and learn to see the world.


This April, two of the students in Blatteau’s law and 
political science seminar at MBA, Damyia Jackson and 
Nyshiah Simon, described a project they had recently 
completed. Last fall, Blatteau’s students curated exhib-
its on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
installed a museum in the school. On December 10, 
Human Rights Day, the museum was opened to the pub-
lic. Jackson and Simon are best friends, practically insep-
arable, and they kept jumping in over each other as they 
talked about the project. Jackson’s project was on wom-
en’s rights, a topic she’d wanted to study since the start 
of the year. “We got to say how we felt,” she said, “using 
facts.” To Simon, that’s true of Blatteau’s class as a whole. 
“We get to speak our word,” she said.


Now that her tenure has begun, the way Carol Birks 
chooses to lead will have profound implications for the 
district. Will she be a tacit supporter of charter schools, or 
an outspoken advocate? Will she engage with traditional 
public schools, or will she retreat into boardrooms? These 
things matter, but one concern overshadows all others. In 
the search for New Haven’s superintendent last fall, stu-
dents felt disregarded and disempowered. But in the class-
room, teachers and administrators have the opportunity to 
change that going forward –– to create a place for students 
to speak their word. There are many means to this end, 
in charter, magnet, and traditional public schools alike. 
As New Haven’s schools turn to the future, with Birks at 
the helm, the fundamental question facing the district is 
whether its students will be silenced –– or whether they’ll 
be able to speak.
