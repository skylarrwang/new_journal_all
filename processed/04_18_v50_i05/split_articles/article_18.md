enough work to do and enough jobs to go around. This 
work’s dispersal in two-week intervals may just be the way 
it is, an inevitable condition of the shipping industry in 
New Haven. That said, Seda’s stakes in the matter have 
changed. Since leaving Gateway, he’s been working for the 
Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental 
Protection as a research vessel captain.


Vasaturo doesn’t discuss dredging in terms of labor, but 
instead imagines the Port becoming, bigger, more profit-
able, more like New York. “It’s going to give more oppor-
tunities,” he says. Anticipation aside, he doesn’t seem con-
cerned about the Port’s present state. “It’s a fun industry,” 
he tells me, as we stand at his office window. Vasaturo 
points down to a small shed in the terminal yard. “That 
little white building is where our hourly workers congre-
gate, and their time cards are in there, so I can really see 
everything from here,” he says. Mixed with the whirr of 
machinery and beeps of trucks in reverse, rock music floats 
in through the glass. 


ers. Processing these huge metal boxes relies heavily on 
automation, which Matthews sees as essential. “I would say 
it definitely absolutely has to occur,” he tells me, “because 
the rest of the world is automating its terminals.” In an 
automated port, “instead of being out driving equipment,” 
Matthews explains, “you’re sitting in front of a computer 
screen and you’re operating three cranes at once as opposed 
to one.”


What happens to the other two crane operators is unclear. 
Perhaps understandably, then, he’s faced opposition from 
the ILA, which has an active branch at the Port of New 
London. “The major frustration in the United States,” he 
says with audible irritation, “is that the ILA and the unions 
refuse to modernize, and all their competing ports across 
the world are modernizing.” Matthews’ duty as Port Author-
ity Director is to keep New Haven, and the other Connecti-
cut ports, competitive as the industry transforms. More 
ships hopefully mean more frequent employment. But at 
the administrative level, the lines connecting prosperity for 
the Port to prosperity for the workers have yet to be drawn.


When I ask Seda if he thinks the Port has a bright future, 
he seems mildly amused, and ponders for a moment. “I 
think so,” he replies. “I think compared to places like 
Bridgeport, it’s better off.” He believes its survival doesn’t 
depend on dredging or other improvements. Without these 
changes, he assumes “it’ll kind of just stay the same,” with
