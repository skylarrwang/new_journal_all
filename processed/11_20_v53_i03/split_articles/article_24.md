oncerts are my theory of relativity — they warp 
time and space. 

Before the pandemic, I used to slip into the 
backs of concert halls, restaurants, and radio 
show basements to attend two to three shows a 
week. Now, I watch livestreams while sitting in 
bed, running outside or lying on the grass with 
headphones while looking at the clouds. I know 
it’s not the same as sharing a physical space, but 
virtual concerts close the distance, sometimes 
thousands of miles of distance, between the per-
formers and me, so that we’re in the same virtual 
venue.

When I’m at a concert, virtual or otherwise, 
time always seems to bend. Some moments feel 
like eternities, in a good way — especially silent 
moments, where we feel like we are suspended 
in air, and everyone holds their breath. Other 
moments pass before I even notice, slipping away 
before I can fully grasp their presence. 

When I’m watching and listening to musicians, 
I both ignore and am hyper aware of the intricacy 
of time and how it stretches and contracts, like 
somewhat-risen sourdough. I watch, listen, feel 
for hours without realizing that time has passed. I 
notice when an ensemble is in perfect synchrony, 
or when the tiniest rhythmic detail falls out of 
step. Performers communicate complex rhythms 
with little gestures. A slight eyebrow raise. Lean-
ing ten degrees to the left. A barely-audible breath. 
They seem to read each other’s minds, perceiving 
time together, as one. And they’ve invited me, an 
audience member, to do it with them.

There’s something magical about synchrony. 
Bands, orchestras, choirs, dance groups, and 
actors — they all aim to coexist in time. I think 
back to a moment this summer when I video 
called a few fellow musicians. We’d been in a 
chamber ensemble together and had been sched-
uled (pre-pandemic) to perform Beethoven’s Op. 
59 No. 1 quartet that evening. Instead of perform-
ing, I navigated to our favorite recording of the 
piece and clicked “share computer sound.” We 
listened, and we cried. I don’t remember much 
else about the call, except how it made us feel. 
Grief, yearning, exuberance. Connectedness 
found through synchrony. A simple act of sharing 
something that’s in time. Sharing a moment in 
time. Sharing time.

Sometimes, though, despite the beauty we’ve 
found in synchrony, sharing time isn’t what we 
want or need, and learning to take things at our 
own pace doesn’t make us any less connected. 
There’s a musical exercise I’ve often turned 
to since the pandemic’s onset, during virtual 
rehearsals. Zoom lag renders synchronous play-
ing impossible. So we aim for asynchrony. We first 
agree on a word or short phrase that characterizes 
the passage. One of us gives a cue — an in-char-
acter breath to show that we’re starting. Then we 
play. We ignore that we’re not in sync. We don’t 
think about harmony, and we don’t think about 
lining up any rhythmic motifs. Using phrasing, 
physical gestures, and timbre, we instead focus 
on communicating a certain musical energy. An 
emotion. It doesn’t sound good. And that doesn’t 
matter.

So we take away the ticking milliseconds and 
obsession over synchrony that I once thought 
defined a performance’s identity. What’s left?

Grief, yearning, exuberance. The emotions 
that have been there all along, but stronger now, 
rawer. Music is our world — an imperfect sphere 
suspended in spacetime. We don’t need to under-
stand how it’s all connected. We just need to 
know that it is.
