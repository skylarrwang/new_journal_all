Teaching Under Triage
By ALICE YAN
T
eaching, in certain ways, is a performance art. The 
teacher, lecturing before a hall brimming with stu-
dents, is the prima ballerina in a Tchaikovsky ballet or 
Lin Manuel Miranda in Hamilton. And, according to 
Shelly Kagan, “performing to an empty theater is just 
completely different from performing to a live audience 
where you’re getting their presence.”

Shelly Kagan’s face fills my computer screen as I’m 
listening to his analogy. He’s in his home office with 
bookcases filled with leather-bound spines behind him. 
The more I talk to him, the more I begin to understand 
why he’s one of Yale’s most popular lecturers. His class 
on “Death” has been so well-received that Yale turned it 
into an Open Yale Course, allowing the public to expe-
rience Kagan and his philosophical teachings. His stage 
presence is captivating, and his passion for whatever 
subject he’s talking about never gets lost, even through 
a computer screen. When he speaks, he leans into the 
camera, close enough that I can see my own reflection 
in his glasses, making it feel like he’s divulging a secret 
rather than speaking about Zoom’s shortcomings. 

Kagan, Clark Professor of Philosophy, is teaching a 
Normative Ethics seminar and a lecture titled “Life” this 
semester, but hasn’t been on campus since March. He is 
not the only professor who hasn’t stepped foot on cam-
pus since the start of the pandemic.

As Yale wraps up its first-ever completely online 
semester, I sat down virtually with five tenured Yale 
faculty members, most of whom have been teaching 
for several decades, to see how they’ve been handling 
online teaching while simultaneously coping with the 
pandemic. While some professors found the transition 
to virtual teaching smooth, others found it frustrating 
and laborious. Some have found more free time for vari-
ous recreational pursuits, while others feel drained after 
a long day of shouting into a microphone the size of a 
large water bottle (more on that later). 

After hours of conversations in front of grainy screens, 
I realized that, in a lot of ways, we may be more similar 
to our professors than I’d previously thought. Along with 
the technical challenges of teaching online, our profes-
sors are dealing with personal obstacles just like every-
one else. What started out as conversations about Zoom 
quickly turned into ruminations on pandemic life, nos-
