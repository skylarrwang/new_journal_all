talgia for the past, and uncertainty about the future.


Only a few classes, such as laboratory and art classes, 
met in-person this semester. Most other classes ran com-
pletely virtually, including Shelly Kagan’s two philoso-
phy courses.


Kagan, a self-described Luddite, admits that he’s been 
struggling with Zoom and prefers to write on his chalk-
board than on the program’s virtual whiteboard. He 
attributes his technological struggles to his age, before 
adding that he purchased his first smartphone only a 
year ago. Before that, he’d been using a hand-me-down 
flip phone.
“I’m an old man. I’m set in my ways. I do not like 
change,” he said.


Three of the professors I interviewed pointed out their 
age when describing their challenges adapting to virtual 
teaching. Joseph Altonji, Thomas DeWitt Cuyler Pro-
fessor of Economics, said that he’s “too much of an old 
dog to learn the new tricks.”


Age was another important factor to consider when 
deciding whether or not to meet in person. Altonji con-
sidered having one introductory meeting in-person for 
his undergraduate labor economics seminar but ulti-
mately decided against it, saying that he would have 
been “slightly uncomfortable,” even if they met outside.


Marcia Inhorn, William K. Lanman Jr. Professor of 
Anthropology and International Affairs, also felt uneasy 
with meeting in-person. “I would not consider meet-
ing [in-person] in a seminar format because of age and 
COVID. I do not want to get COVID-19. I don’t want to 
spread it to my family.”


Most of the professors I spoke with are between fifty 
and sixty-four years old, an age group four times more 
likely to require hospitalization for COVID and thirty 
times more likely to die when compared to most under-
graduates at Yale, according to the CDC.


Teaching virtually has come at a cost for Kagan, 
beyond just having to deal with technological chal-
lenges. He laments that he can no longer receive the 
constant feedback from his environment that he usu-
ally gets from lecturing in-person. The rustling of bod-
ies if he’s being boring, the subtle “huh”s as students are 
thinking about a question he just posed––all of it is lost 
on Zoom. 
“I feel the difference. I feel stiffer lecturing. I feel less 
in the flow,” he added.


Some professors, unlike Kagan, feel too much in the 
flow. Altonji misses being interrupted by spontaneous 
questions from his students, saying that oftentimes this 
semester he would lecture for ten minutes without inter-
ruption. William Nordhaus, Sterling Professor of Eco-
nomics, has the same problem and reminds himself not 
to “go on and on and on.” Laughing, he says, “[Zoom] is 
not a very lively medium.”


As I talked to more professors, I found that the prob-
lems we students face with virtual classes are compara-
ble, yet still vastly different from the ones our professors 
face. Sure, we might all experience the occasional bad 
WiFi connection, but if their Internet goes down, a class 
of one hundred students is left in silence. If ours goes 
down, we can get the notes from a friend or watch the 
lecture later on Canvas. Their problems seemed to be 
amplified versions of ours, because they have to manage 
a class on top of dealing with whatever obstacles may 
arise.


Beyond the classroom, professors had to confront 
their own personal challenges as well. One common 
theme links them all together—a longing for the past. 
Nordhaus says that he’s been back to his office a few 
times to pick up books and “look nostalgically at all the 
things [he’s] missing.”


What Altonji misses deeply is regular social interac-
tion with his colleagues and students. Along with his 
classes, all of his professional conferences have been 
moved online as well. “You can get a fair amount out of 
the presentations but you don’t have conversations with 
people about what they’re working on or even just how 
they’re doing,” he said. 


Marcia Inhorn has been staying in her house with her 
husband and children as much as possible. She laments 
not being able to see her elderly parents, who live in 
another state. 


Inhorn added, “It’s really been tough to be so sepa-
rated from family that I would’ve certainly seen this 
year.”


Shelly Kagan and his family have also been minimiz-
ing the amount of time they spend outside of the house, 
resulting in his family’s use of Instacart for their grocer-
ies. The online orders sparked a philosophical debate in 
his household. “It means we don’t have to go into the 
grocery store, but we’re sending somebody else into the 
grocery store, so they’re at greater risk. Who is this per-
son that’s being sent into the grocery store? This person 
will be either somebody who’s lost their job or needs the 
extra money. So basically I’m taking advantage of the 
fact that I’m comfortable financially to make somebody 
else take the risk for me. Is that morally legitimate?” 


Even philosophizing has grown more difficult. He 
finds that, when staring into space — the main way he 
ponders philosophical questions — fewer thoughts are 
coming to his mind. He succumbs easily to distractions 
on his computer from the newest New York Times

headlines about COVID or the election. He says, rather 
drily, that all of this falls under what he calls “pandem-
ic-induced stupidity.”


I resonated with the relatability of his comment. I 
didn’t think I would have much in common with some-
one who had to use a slide rule in his math classes. I 
thought about my version of Kagan’s pandemic-in-
duced stupidity. It’s having to read the same paragraph 
three times because I’m thinking about how I only 
walked 2,000 steps today. Or not realizing I’d missed a 
meeting with my dean because I was too busy reading 
COVID-related predictions in the Times. 


With challenges, however, come solutions. After all, 
the professors I spoke to didn’t get to where they are 
without adapting and overcoming obstacles.


In an effort to “simulate as close as possible the real-
life experience,” Kagan asks his students in his seminar 
to keep their videos and microphones on at all times “so 
when they’re ready to jump in they don’t have to fumble 
around and unmute themselves.” Much to his delight, 
his students love to talk, so he hasn’t seen a drop in 
engagement in his seminar.


Although Altonji has noticed a dip in participation, 
he’s found that one-on-one interactions with students 
work great remotely. Because of the ability to share 
screens, he can easily review his students’ empirical 
projects with them. “The medium works very well for 
one-on-one advising,” he said. “I can just as easily meet 
with a student at eight at night as I can at nine in the 
morning.”


William Nordhaus also loves the flexibility and con-
venience of Zoom. He’s looking forward to not trekking 
a mile through the snow in the middle of winter to get to 
class.  In terms of long distance travel, a few weeks ago, 
he gave a talk in Italy and didn’t have to board an air-
plane. The setup time for his Zoom classes is a lot less 
than for a normal in-person class, and he’s happy about 
the few hours a week saved just in terms of logistics.


Along with all the challenges, the pandemic has also 
brought small joys to the daily lives of some professors.


Smiling, Professor Inhorn tells me about how her 
millennial children have been home since the spring. 
“We’re living together for the first time in years. Person-
ally, as a mother, it’s been fantastic. It would’ve never 
happened otherwise.”


Professor Altonji has also been spending more time 
with his family, now that he doesn’t have to commute to 
New Haven from his home in Madison, Connecticut. 
He speaks fondly of hiking, cycling, and playing tennis 
with his wife, all things he wouldn’t have done regularly 
had he been working from his office on Hillhouse Ave-
nue.


Moira Fradinger, Associate Professor and Director 
of Undergraduate Studies for Comparative Literature, 
is the only professor I spoke with who has an in-person 
component to her course this semester. Her graduate 
class on key concepts in psychoanalysis meets in-person 
and is streamed via Zoom for those who cannot physi-
cally attend.
“After Trump’s administration decided to put a ban or 
to limit the access of foreigners to American universities 
if they did not have an in-person component, I volun-
teered in my department to offer a hybrid class… so that 
foreigners could apply for this as a credit.”


This semester has not been easy for Fradinger. The 
first room she was given in Old Campus had only two 
small windows offering poor ventilation and was not 
large enough to accommodate a seminar of fifteen 
socially distanced people. After three weeks in this 
room and a second attempt at finding a different one, 
Fradinger was given an appropriately sized room in Ros-
enfeld Hall. A permanent classroom found, she now had 
to determine how to have everyone’s voices be heard.


In each meeting, she couldn’t walk around but had 
to stay in the same place with a large microphone a 
few feet away from her, which was supposed to record 
in-person conversation so that the virtual participants 
would be able to listen and participate in the discus-
sion. Even though the microphone was the size of one 
seltzer bottle (as she describes it), it was not sensitive 
enough. Because the students were spread six feet apart, 
it wouldn’t pick up their voices. To try to find a solution, 
Fradinger asked a theater student to teach everyone 
in the class how to properly project their voices with-
out having to move closer to the microphone and risk 
breaking social distancing, and Classroom Technology 
& Media Specialists Tony Sudol and Paul Auringer was 
instrumental in providing the microphone and helping

her throughout the semester.


Issues with the microphone, coupled with connec-
tion issues from the streaming program, left Fradinger 
drained after each class. “I finished with such an exhaus-
tion every Wednesday,” she said. …“my semester has 
been consumed by learning how to make it work. The 
technological preparation––being there half an hour 
before… staying afterwards to clean, my Wednesdays 
were completely useless because I was so exhausted. 
My voice was hoarse and pretty much out because I was 
shouting for two to three hours.”


Through all of the difficulties, Professor Fradinger 
found some positives that came from teaching her 
hybrid course. The students grew attached to each 
other, which was one of the reasons that Professor 
Fradinger cites for keeping the in-person component, 
even though she had considered going fully virtual 
many times throughout the semester. 
“I really found the group of students fantastic, and 
[we] managed to create an atmosphere in which we 
were all together in making an effort to cope with poor 
technology,” she added.


During my interview with Professor Fradinger, I was 
sitting in the passenger seat of a car that was driving 
through rural Pennsylvania, so I inevitably lost signal a 
few times. Every time I reconnected, she always had a 
calm smile on her face, assuring me that everything was 
fine in response to my frantic apologies. I imagine this 
sort of patience was necessary to overcome all of the 
technological and organizational challenges she faced 
this semester.


Marcia Inhonrn’s teaching isn’t the only aspect of her 
academic experience that’s changed. Her research has 
been completely reshaped by the onset of the pandemic. 
She is currently working on a project on infertility and 
assisted reproductive technologies. Anthropologists of 
reproduction, like herself, are concerned about the ways 
that COVID has affected reproduction, including the 
shutting down of in-vitro fertilization centers around the 
world. 
“It’s caused further delays for people who are feel-
ing up against the biological clock, if you will. There’s 
been a lot of grief about that. What is it going to mean? 
Is COVID going to be the reason that I never end up 
having children?”


I compared my own pandemic-related problems to 
those of Inhorn’s research subjects. All of a sudden, they 
didn’t seem that significant anymore, which isn’t to say 
that they aren’t still legitimate concerns. But, I’m fortu-
nate, as I’m not up against the so-called biological clock, 
and the pandemic hasn’t severely disrupted my life and 
family planning. The minimization, which is different 
from trivialization, of my own issues is comforting.


As I hit the “stop recording” button on my phone and 
thanked Professor Altonji for his time, he surprised me 
with a question. He asked me how I was doing. The last 
time I’d seen him was last May in an economics seminar 
I’d taken. I looked at his face on my computer screen for 
a minute. His hair had grown long, and he was wearing 
a casual fleece sweater instead of the button-downs I was 
used to seeing him wear. I thought about his question. 
How was I doing?


I said I was doing well because I really was doing 
well. I told him about how much I was enjoying being 
home after a semester in New Haven. He told me about 
the trails and forest preserves he and his wife had been 
exploring. I couldn’t remember the last time some-
one asked me how I was. Talking to Professor Altonji 
about the small joys we were savoring in our lives was 
a nice escape from the pressures that this pandemic has 
brought. His simple question left me with a smile on my 
face long after our call ended.
