they make up fifty percent of the county’s cases. I 
know that in July of this year, the California Insti-
tute for Rural Studies found that farmworkers in my 
county are three times as likely as other essential 
workers to test positive for COVID-19. I know that 
if my parents were to get sick they would be vul-
nerable because of the parts of their bodies already 
worn down by their labor, and I know that because 
undocumented workers are not eligible for stimu-
lus checks, disability benefits, or health insurance, 
my parents will be forced to keep disregarding their 
bodies for as long as possible. I feel like my parents 
are being held hostage. This makes me want to cry 
and scream and break some shit in anger, but my 
parents don’t see it the way I do. To them, it’s just 
the way it’s always been.


In my earliest memory, I am four years old and 
running over white and green kitchen tiles, opening 
empty cupboards, and standing in the door frame of 
my childhood bedroom yelling, “I call this one!” It 
was the day that we moved into our current apart-
ment, the first home of our own, and the world was 
brimming with possibility.


In the few months after we received confirmation 
that we had been approved to move into Jardines 
del Valle, the official name for the MidPen owned 
housing complex, my parents had crafted a perfect 
fantasy of our new home. A playground. A basket-
ball court. A room of my own—not just one for the 
four of us. A soccer field. Lots of space to run and 
play. “Un sueño,” they called it. A dream.


At the time I didn’t know, of course, what was so 
miraculous about it. Later I learned that since Mid-
Pen Housing renovated the complex in 1996 specif-
ically for low-income agricultural workers and their 
families, we were only able to afford it because the 
rent was partly subsidized. Known first as Murphy’s 
Camp, and later as El Campo del Hoyo, the place 
has endured for a hundred years as a permanent 
site of contradiction, a place for laborers where no 
labor occurs, an enclave for rest. Over the past few 
months, since the coronavirus pandemic forced me 
to come home from college, I’ve been trying to fig-
ure out my place here. I walk around my neighbor-
hood looking for answers, or maybe ghosts, imagin-
ing the stories that have passed through here in the 
hopes that they’ll help me discover my own.


Fermin Tobera is the ghost I think about the 
most. In the late 1920s, when the camp was just a 
few rows of bunkhouses, Fermin Tobera slept and 
bathed here. He was twenty years old when he left 
his home country of the Philippines and made his 
way to Watsonville in the hopes of finding work in 
the fields and being able to send money home. His 
mother characterized him as “gentle” and “cour-
teous to the old.” On January 23rd, 1930—a few 
months before his twenty-second birthday—Fermin 
Tobera was hiding in a closet  when a shot was fired 
into his bunkhouse, striking him through his heart.


The days preceding his murder had seen some 
of the worst instances of anti-Filipino violence ever 
documented in the US. On the night of January 
18th, 1930, about five hundred white men and boys 
brought clubs and weapons to a Filipino-owned 
dance club in the Palm Beach section of Watson-
ville and threatened to burn the place down. They 
had heard that there were nine white women living 
in the dance club, and they intended to ‘liberate’ 
them. Due to bias in immigration and hiring pol-
icies, only one in fourteen Filipino laborers doing 
seasonal farm work were women, and the men 
often sought the companionship of white women. 
This incensed Watsonville’s white population. 
Immigrants were not supposed to ‘take’ things—
including women, who were seen as things. They 
were only supposed to give—to give their labor 
and their time and their bodies—and they were 
supposed to do so without laying down roots in this 
country or asking for anything in return.


In the mind of the mob, Filipinos had broken 
a silent contract, and it was time to pay. The own-
ers threatened to shoot if the mob didn’t recede. It 
didn’t. The owners opened fire. What followed was 
a week of horrifying racial violence against Filipino 
laborers. At Riberal’s labor camp, carloads of white 
men pulled workers out of their homes and beat 
them in the streets. Rioters demolished a Chinese 
apple dryer that employed Filipinos. They threw 
people off the Pajaro Bridge. Fermin Tobera’s mur-
der was the tragic culmination of it all.


I wonder how long his body sat in that closet 
before it was picked up and flown to Manila, where 
his home country sponsored a large funeral for him, 


I wonder this because those particularities make me feel like I carry him 
somehow, like his body hasn’t been completely 
erased from this place. I wonder this because it feels 
important that his body was able to rest before it 
had to cross another border.


The summer after my sophomore year of high 
school, my mother caught me and my cousin smok-
ing the world’s smallest joint in one of the empty 
tractors that sit in the fields behind our house. After 
dragging us back inside by our ears, she delivered 
an hour-long sermon about how drug use leads you 
on a rapid downward spiral towards degeneracy 
and homelessness, and also makes you stupid. My 
mother became convinced that I was going to drop 
out of school, run off with a drug dealer, and come 
back home with a baby. (My mother watches a lot 
of telenovelas). As punishment, she gave me two 
options: spend the summer at my grandmother’s 
house in Mexico without cell service and internet 
or go to work with her to see what my future would 
look like if I stayed on this ‘wrong path.’


The next morning, I wrapped a bandana around 
my face to protect me from the sun and headed out 
in Converse and Hollister jeans for my first day at 
work. I was annoyed, but not too worried; work-
ing in the fields didn’t seem that hard, and at least 
I wouldn’t be bored. When we got there, the sun 
was starting to rise, and a beautiful shade of orange 
reflected off the tarps covering unending miles of 
produce. The mayordomo divided us into sections, 
handed us our boxes, and told us to start working.


It took about an hour for me to realize that I had 
absolutely no idea what I was doing. While the 
women around me were about a third of the way 
through their sections, working like machines as 
they crawled on their knees from row to row, I was 
embarrassingly slow and increasingly tired. I had 
no idea how to decide which berries were ready and 
was constantly drawn to the reddest, sweetest-look-
ing strawberries on the vine. Rookie mistake. By the 
time they were packaged, shipped, and ready to eat, 
they would be speckled with mushy looking grooves 
and impossible to sell. Sometimes, when I pulled 
one of these out, the older señoras working next to 
me would pause their gossiping to say, “Not that 
one, mija.”


By the time the clock hit ten and the mayor-
domo released us for our first break, I was ready to 
collapse out of exhaustion. My hips were tight from 
squatting, my eyes were itchy from the dust, bruises 
formed on my knees, and I was developing a head-
ache from the constant movement. The sun, which 
had seemed so beautiful in the morning, was sud-
denly unforgiving. I felt the sun burning the back of 
my neck and wanted nothing more than to accept 
defeat and go home. But the day was only begin-
ning, and rest came only in a fifteen-minute “sit 
under the shade, drink some water, pee if you need 
to, stuff half a granola bar into your mouth before 
the mayordomo is yelling ‘back to work’” interval.


The militaristic nature of el fil was a harsh 
reminder of my mother’s words, of all the sacri-
fices my parents had made for me, sacrifices which 
apparently I’d squandered by allowing myself to be 
a normal teenager. “This is where you’ll end up,” 
she told me, “If you don’t start taking your future 
more seriously.” I did start taking it more seriously, 
not because I particularly cared about where I 
ended up, but because I understood that my future 
was inextricably tied to my family’s, and I wanted 
their story to end somewhere other than those 
fields.


Almost a full five years later, I’m well on my 
way to receiving a degree from Yale, which should 
make me feel like I’ve made some progress toward 
improving my family’s position. But mostly it just 
makes me angry, because I also feel like I’m being 
held hostage. When I was in high school, teachers 
would tell me that because I was so “gifted,” I would 
surely be the one to make it out of the barrio and 
have the opportunity to go to college on a scholar-
ship. When I received my acceptance letter, it felt 
like all the pieces were falling into place: an Ivy-
league degree, a six-figure income, a future where 
I could give my parents a comfortable life and an 
opportunity to finally rest.


Instead, I got to Yale and came face to face with 
the reality of how institutional power permeates 
every facet of elite universities and makes it impos-
sible for marginalized students to survive their 
four years unscathed. In my classes, I sat through 
hearing my exorbitantly wealthy peers think about 
poverty and racism for the first time while my 
lived experiences were pushed aside or tokenized. 
During my first year, I learned how disposable stu-
dents are to Yale when one of my best friends was 
forced to withdraw from school because she failed 
a class when her mother had cancer. The admin-
istration’s attitude of “business as usual” during 
this pandemic and during the 2020 election has 
proven that humanity is not one of their priori-


ties. This immense pressure to perform under any 
circumstances makes it clear to me that Yale does 
not care about us—we are here to support the uni-
versity’s brand of diversity and equity, and that is it. 
Yet I continue to study for the same reason that my 
parents continue to work, because I am fulfilling a 
promise, and also because there is no other option.


On the day I went to work with my mother, we 
got home at about 4:30 in the afternoon and my 
exhausted body demanded rest from me for sev-
eral hours. I slept through dinner and didn’t wake 
up until about 9 p.m.; when I did wake up, there 
was a heating pad thrown over my back and two tab-
lets of Advil on my bedside table. My parents didn’t 
wake me up for work the next day even though 
the terms of my punishment were that I would 
continue for the rest of the summer. Every time I 
think about how my parents didn’t want me to put 
my body through for even one more day what they 
have theirs for decades, I start to cry. I don’t know 
how I’m supposed to allow myself to rest. I haven’t 
earned it.


When I wander around my neighborhood, I pic-
ture how many generations of farmworkers have 
lived and died here, how many bodies have decayed 
and resisted here, and I allow myself to feel a little 
hope. I remind myself that the problem didn’t start 
with me and that it probably won’t end with me, but 
that that’s okay. Although to others we may be dis-
posable, we are not to each other. That is enough 
to guarantee that the struggle for a better world will 
not end with me, and that someday it won’t be this 
way anymore.
