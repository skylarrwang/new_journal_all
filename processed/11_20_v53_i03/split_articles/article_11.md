I 
asked my mom one day how she chose my Chinese 
name, Aì Lì, or “love jasmine flower.” We were in 
the car driving back from New Haven for winter break. 
She told me it was just a phonetic transcription of my 
English name, Alice, which she had decided on before 
my Chinese name. “Your name means beauty,” she 
said. “Don’t you want to be beautiful?”


I thought about all the times that I’d been called 
beautiful.


The time I was in China, and a stranger approached 
me on the street and complimented me on my “big 
eyes.” She said she’d always wanted double-folded 
eyelids like mine. I smiled a polite smile, trying to 
mask my discomfort, and mumbled a quick “thank 
you.” I didn’t know how she wanted me to react. I 
couldn’t think of a more meaningless thing to say to 
someone. 


The time I was walking in front of Payne Whitney 
on my way back from class and a man came running 
toward me, waving his hands. He stopped in front of 
me and said that he’d just driven past me and made 
his friend stop the car so that he could get out and 
ask for my phone number. “Why don’t you put your 
number in my phone?” I said, but he was adamant 
and wouldn’t leave. He was already walking back to 
his car when he remembered to ask my name.  He 
sent me a six-second voice memo later that night. “Is 
this the beautiful girl in the black dress?”


The time I stood across from Patagonia on York 
Street and listened to a boy tell me that, no, he wasn’t 
interested in hanging out with me if I wasn’t going to 
sleep with him. I wasn’t worth more than what my 
body could offer him. All I wanted was for someone 
to want to spend time with me regardless of what I 
looked like, but that seemed more and more unat-
tainable. 


I thought about my grandmother, my laolao. She 
changed her name from “elegant and charming” 
to “always striving” when she was my age, because 
she thought her original name didn’t represent her 
ambition. She went to university when it wasn’t com-
mon for women in China and dedicated her career 
to teaching mining engineering to college students.


I thought about my mother. She came to the 
United States with nothing but a small, red suitcase 
and two hundred dollars to start a new life here as 
a PhD candidate in Wyoming. My mom raised my 
sister and me by herself while working long hours at 
a pharmaceutical company.  She would come back 
home everyday, exhausted but nevertheless yelling, 
“Lì lì, I’m home!”


I want to be beautiful like leaving your friends and 
family for an unfamiliar place so that you could give 
your future children a better life. I want to be beauti-
ful like persisting as the only woman in a department 
of men who thought they knew more than you. I 
want to be beautiful like staying up until two a.m. on 
FaceTime with your friend, doing nothing but savor-
ing their company because you told them you were 
feeling lonely. I want to be beautiful like finding out 
someone remembered a small detail about you that 
you don’t even remember telling them. I want to be 
beautiful like slowly learning that your worth is not 
tied to what one imbecilic boy said to you sophomore 
year. That’s the kind of beautiful I want to be.
