How badly I want to write
 you something new
 journal,
But all year long it’s been the same
 Poems, over and over
The pine branches look like thin ribs again
 the spruces in their robes that drape 
The pond like hammered silver, again
 flinging the light off tiny waves
The hens move in one bob still again
 they gather at the fence in trailing shape
And will it always feel like the chilled spring,
 when they sent us packing?
As I was driving back on I-95,
 the raindrops huge slow and hard,
I did see something new from my car
 a black knot of birds exploded 
 right when one raindrop hit so loud 
I thought I could hear the flock breaking apart
/
 you something true
But if I didn’t live this out 
 someone else would —
Just pulling on a loose thread again,
 to fray a pattern or fix a stitch 
Time feels like a hem, again
 and pain is fabric caught in the clip,
 sew machine running up seams, again, 
 bunching them up, hearing them split
Will you always do them like you did me,
 setting up for tailored dread?
Well, I saw Bunny in the window 
And I tell you I almost called out 
 lady, wearing his clothes 
 won’t make you his baby
You must dress yourself, can’t dress no one else,
 can’t dress for two, hung up like a coatroom
But I know how it feels to look nice in costume
 you something rude
But if I start ragging on him
 Soft love tut-tuts me
Around and inside me, again
 — the stretch of silence, counting penalty
Fastened tight, rocking slight, again
 — defer, defer blame, defer decision to infinity
Breath, felt and held, again
 — withdrawal, a weapon, and softening, my currency 
Will I at least get back my simple heat
 now that nobody’s juking me?
 
 Suppose it did come rather easy 
 to breathe with Cas on a roof on Dwight 
 swapping selves in broad daylight,
And snowy Noah came soliciting, 
 readily enough, bold joyful pressing, 
Oh, once I’d kissed Kathleen a sec
 for days I couldn’t get 
 her waking up naked out of my head, 
Then this dream of you looking seedy 
 sucking a cigarette, making me queasy
How badly I want to write, 
but I mirror a body 
 of work been here twenty years
My breasts in ellipse like bells again
 ringing when I sit up and settling apart,
 arranged on my chest, whole bells again 
 competing with my shoulders for Most Graceful Rounded 
Part
My mind is mirror-manifest again
 and when I move, it moves, and when I jump, it starts
Will I get by looking like this 
 won’t I ever have something to make?
Well, I tried whittling in the park
The wood was lightweight from my yard 
 I cut away a handle of three shapely knots
When I got to the basin of my spoon
 the wood revealed its rot, and I 
 can’t do much but strain soup
Got a nice spoon that can’t serve or scoop. 
journal
The pines the pond the farm the hens
The seam the stitch the fraying ends
The breath the dark the mouth the bed
The breast the mind the heart the rest
