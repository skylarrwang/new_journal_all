is: Tsoglin (Gomel’, Chernigov gub.) K: see Segal (?).
When I see the entry for Tsoglin, I know it’s my family. 

In the 1990s, my grandmother had gotten in touch with a 
family in Brooklyn. Their last name was Tsoglin, and they 
came from the Gomel region in what is now Belarus, too, 
though they’d stayed in the Soviet Union until only a few 
years before. Grandma and the Tsoglins realized that they 
possessed the same family photograph from the 1910s. The 
Tsoglins turned out to be Ari’s brother Abel’s descendants, 
making them my second cousins, once removed. So 
Tsoglin (Gomel’) doesn’t tell me anything I didn’t know 
already, technically, but I’m surprised by how weighty the 
moment feels. That is where I came from, and to see it in 
print is proof.  

The only other time I had read a name so similar to 
mine was in high school. One day, as I skimmed an 
issue of Time magazine at my dining room table in Cal-
ifornia, my eyes were drawn to a byline at the bottom 
of a page. The name, in bold font, was Richard Zoglin. 
I read that byline more than twice, just to make sure. 
Then I told my dad what I’d read, wondering if I was 
on the edge of an exciting new genealogical discovery. 
But he told me that he’d already exchanged emails with 
the Zoglins. Richard Zoglin and his brother Paul had 
grandparents from Gomel, too, but they could never go 
back far enough to prove we were related.  

It turns out that the Soglin-Tsoglin-Zoglin spellings 
constitute a classic conundrum of Jewish  genealogy, 
the solution to which began in 1918, when a man named 
Robert Russell developed the first sound-matching sys-
tem, which coded letters to numbers to allow names 
to be classified by sound rather than by spelling. In 
the mid-1980s, Mokotoff and his collaborator, Randy 
Daitch, realized that the Russell system didn’t do a good 
job of matching Slavic or Yiddish-German names, so 
they created their own. In the Daitch-Mokotoff system, 
which is now used in the Ellis Island database and at the 
Holocaust Memorial Museum, letter combinations that 
make the same sounds are coded in the same way. The 
“Ts,” sound, for instance, has the same Daitch-Moko-
toff number as “Tz,” “S,” and “Z.” Double letters with 
multiple sounds—“Ch,” for example — are coded dif-
ferently for each.  

What Mokotoff can’t tell me is what my name means. 
I hardly even thought to ask the question, because it 
has been so unanswerable for so long. But Mokotoff 
tells me to call Alexander Beider, a Sorbonne-educated 
expert on Jewish names and author of our dictionary. 
When I call Beider in Paris, I’m not sure exactly what I 
want to hear.  

Alexander Beider tells me almost immediately that 
Soglin is an obviously monogenetic name, by  which 
he means a name that only one family has ever taken. 
More specifically, he means that it’s a  name one person 
in a shtetl in western Russia chose sometime in the ear-
ly-to-mid-nineteenth century. That’s what the root was. 
The Zoglins, Tsoglins, and Soglins are all branches off 
the tree that grew from that root, but Beider doesn’t 
know what they mean. His best guess is that it’s a cor-
rupted form of a Yiddish occupational name; the  “-in” 
a Russian suffix appended onto whatever now-forgotten 
word some single distant ancestor of mine chose for for-
ever. When I hang up the phone, I realize that if Beider 
doesn’t know what my name means, I probably never 
will. It might be a dead end, but it’s one that all of us 
share together. 

On my last visit to Avotaynu, Mokotoff codes my 
name for me by hand. The Daitch-Mokotoff  system 
boils names down to their consonants, then matches 
each sound to a number. Mokotoff  sounds out each 
consonant. S-G-L-N, he says, is 4-5-8-6.

**Title: Avotaynu**
**Page number(s): 41**

***
Avotaynu means “our fathers” in Hebrew, though in 
time it has come to mean “our ancestors.” It’s  one 
of the first words in the Amidah, the central prayer of 
the Jewish service, which praises God and the Biblical 
patriarchs.  

Baruch atah Adonai, eloheniu ve-lo-hei avoteinu  
Blessed are you, Adonai, our God and God of our 
ancestors  

Elohei Avraham, elohei Yitzchak, vey-lo-he Ya’akov 
[elohei Sarah, elohei Rivkah, vei-lo-hei  Rachel v’Leah] 
God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob [God of 
Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah]  

One day in the eighties, when he and Sack-Pikus 
were still searching for a name for their journal,  Moko-
toff heard the Amidah in synagogue. “Avotaynu,” he 
said to himself—“that’s it.”

Mokotoff tells me that he thinks on a day not so far 
away, genealogy will be over. Brick walls are brick walls, 
so there will be no tracing back to Isaac or Jacob (or 
Sarah or Rebecca or Rachel or Leah). But there will 
come a day when an eager genealogist logs onto Ances-
try or Geni and discovers that their family tree has 
already been completed. Mokotoff seems less bothered 
by this than I would have expected, but I think I hear a 
trace of emotion under the monotone.  

One day back in 1982, Gary and Ruth Mokotoff stood 
outside a stranger’s apartment in Tel Aviv. Moshe Moko-
tow wasn’t exactly a stranger, of course, but Gary and 
Ruth had never met him. From the doorstep, the two 
Americans heard some jubilance upstairs, the result of 
the gathering in Moshe’s apartment of a couple dozen 
Israeli Mokotoffs. Gary, the “all around makher” who 
had brought them all together, waited outside the apart-
ment, considering what he would say when he made it 
upstairs. Eventually, he and Ruth were retrieved from 
the doorstep by one relative or another and led into the 
fray. What he exclaimed when he walked into the room 
was this: “Shmi Mokotoff ”:  My name is Mokotoff.
