I
n mid-November, I started reading Virginia Woolf’s 
To the Lighthouse and, like James Ramsay, one of 
the novel’s main characters, I developed something 
of an idée fixe about visiting one. Lighthouses embody 
a contradiction I wanted to understand––they are, in 
Woolf’s words, “endlessly suggestive signifiers of both 
human isolation and our ultimate connectedness to 
each other.” The timing seemed right to reconcile the 
two: I had recently recovered from COVID-19 and 
finished a lonely quarantine. So on a wind-bitten day 
before Thanksgiving, I trekked out to Five Mile Point 
lighthouse, which sits on a promontory at the lip of 
New Haven Harbor. I was hoping for illumination––
what else would a lighthouse provide?––to see whether 
visiting the place, as if consulting an oracle, might 
resolve the antithesis Woolf identified. 

On the beach, Five Mile Point lighthouse is massive 
and deceptively everywhere. Swivel your head in any 
direction and it will eventually show itself. I climbed 
the staircase leading to the optic section at the top of 
the lighthouse––a 74-step spiral that narrows like the 
chamber of a seashell––with the sound of shards of 
stone crunching under foot caroming off the walls.

Late in the day, the glass enclosure, seventy feet in 
the air, no more than six feet in diameter and eight in 
height, fills with sunlight but does not glow. The scene 
expands but the room constricts.

From this vantage, at the tower’s crown, New Hav-
en’s skyline looks small and secret, like it was never 
supposed to be seen from this side, denuded of smoke-
stacks and golden when the sun is low. The view is 
about the boldest illustration of New Haven’s conquest 
of the coast. Looking out, I could see all of the city 
from City Point to the East Shore and, on the horizon, 
oil tankers and oyster fishers navigating the waters, a 
marriage of the new and old New Worlds. New Haven 
follows a rule about coastal cities: their progress 
depends on their mastery of the sea. Mastery of the sea 
was impossible without a lighthouse. 

For thirty years, Five Mile Point did what it could to 
guide seafarers into port, but because it was situated 
too far inland, its light was dim to the point of invis-
ibility in thick fog and ships kept running their keels 
over the rocks in the harbor. In 1877, the lighthouse 
was decommissioned, stripped of its fog bell and 4,000-
pound lens. On the inside, all that’s left is the view 
out. At the top of Five Mile Point I realized, as James 
Ramsay eventually does, that the allure of lighthouses 
is in the distance from them—that I was only in “a stark 
tower on a bare rock.” 

Across the water, I could faintly make out New Hav-
en’s other lighthouse, the active one, Southwest Ledge 
Light. And though I had just come to understand what 
reaching a lighthouse does to its allure, what is lost in 
the summit, I wanted to get closer.

I couldn’t. Southwest Ledge Light is privately owned 
but under the Coast Guard’s jurisdiction. Hoping 
to catch a ride out to the island on one of the Coast 
Guard’s regular maintenance visits, I called the New 
Haven station so many times that the officers started 
to recognize my voice (“ayyy, it’s you again!”). They 
told me it would be months before conditions would be 
right for a trip out and even then nothing was guaran-
teed. In the meantime, photographs of the lighthouse 
would have to suffice. 

The photographs seemed to capture what the early 
American daguerreotypist Albert Southword said the 
medium can: the “soul of the subject itself.” Because 
they have the features of a body––neck, face, and 
complexion––and suggest an inner life with cycles of 
ruin and grace, lighthouses have been ripe for anthro-
pomorphizing. A picture taken by the Coast Guard 
in 1903 shows Southwest Ledge Light pallid and for-
gotten––the soul of a different American Gothic. The 
lighthouse stands on less than an acre of breakwater, an 
artificial landing made from the rubble of underwater 
rock, or “riprap.” Its footprint extends no longer than 
a brontosaurus from tail to jaw and the boulders that 
jut toward the mainland, shrinking as the water deep-
ens, resemble vertebrae. The smallness of the island is 
apparent and the water in the foreground twists like in 
a Munch painting. The lighthouse’s Second Empire 
exterior and mansard roof were meant to make it look 
homey, but to today’s eyes the structure looks haunted, 
as if a turret of a Victorian mansion had harpooned 
its way through the rock, leaving the rest of the house 
submerged.

Given the building’s eeriness, I wondered whether it 
had been the scene of something brutal. Journal entries 
from the winter of 1907-8 confirmed my suspicion, pre-
figuring the plot of Robert Eggers’ 2019 period horror 
film The Lighthouse: an assistant tried to kill the head 
keeper twice, the first time with a fire axe, the second 
with a butcher’s knife. Failing, he rowed to shore and 
committed suicide. Lighthouse folklore is replete with 
other accounts of madness: the first two keepers at the 
Phare de Tévennec, a lighthouse off the coast of Brit-
tany, were driven insane by what they believed were 
the voices of ghosts; Theed “Crazy” Judson, a keeper at 
Stratford Point Light in Connecticut, claimed to have 
seen sea serpents and mermaids rising from the water. 

The trope of the deranged lighthouse keeper is easy 
to rationalize. The labor and repetition were relentless: 
every night polishing the lens of the lamp, stoking the 
fire within it with explosive whale oil, cranking the 
light nonstop during storms, and enduring the blow 
of the foghorn every fifteen seconds, like a clockwork 
song of the sirens, sometimes for weeks

on end. A keeper’s day might leave too little room for 
quiet contemplation, or too much. “The trouble with 
our life here,” said Milton Herbert Reamy, a Massachu-
setts keeper, “is that we have too much time to think.” 

What’s more, some scholars speculate, in bathing their 
lenses in liquid mercury to reduce the friction of the 
bearings beneath the lamp, keepers inadvertently poi-
soned themselves and triggered a kind of psychosis, 
more commonly known as mad hatter syndrome. Bore-
dom, hard labor, and chemical exposure were a perfect 
storm many keepers could not weather.    

But the job was done nonetheless, and done for mil-
lennia, all the way back to the Phoenicians, who built 
a network of navigational aids throughout the Mediter-
ranean––temples with eternal flames that priests lit at 
night. The Greeks did the same with their city-states. 
The Romans built towers at Ostia, Ravenna, Pozzuoli, 
Messina, Dover, and Boulogne, each integral to the 
settlement of port cities and the empire’s expansion. 
Controlling light made longer voyages possible and 
with them a larger geography of exchange and war, 
connecting mariners to the land and civilizations with 
one another. Centuries later, lighthouses became some 
of the world’s first non-military public works, adding 
nuance to the role of the state and laying the founda-
tion for its infrastructure. 

Every empire learned pharology, the science of light-
house construction, named after the island of Pharos, 
where the famous Lighthouse of Alexandria was built. 
Long after the Lighthouse of Alexandria became a ruin 
and Rome an idea, the modern empires of France, 
Britain, and America advanced the art. The Tour de 
Cordouan in France, completed in 1611, was the first 
lighthouse to use a Fresnel lens, the 
invention said to have “saved a mil-
lion ships.” A Fresnel lens looks like a 
twelve-foot-tall Fabergé egg made of 
glass with concentric rings etched on 
the surface in the shape of rippling 
water. It aligns an array of prisms on 
incrementally more dramatic angles 
to collimate, or make parallel, the 
rays of light from an oil lamp, con-
centrating them into a single intense 
beam. By the mid-19th century, most 
lighthouses had one. Fresnel lenses 
were also used in early car head-
lamps, movie projectors, cameras, 
and aircraft carrier landing strips. 
Many modern conveniences still 
have a little lighthouse in them. 

Most lighthouses today don’t use 
a Fresnel lens. Blinking LEDs have 
replaced them and GPS, VHF radio, and other com-
puter electronics have reduced them to failsafes. All but 
a few have been automated. There are still a few dozen 
civilian keepers, but the last generation of keepers in 
the Coast Guard has dwindled to one: Sally Snowman, 
who has been tending the light in Boston Harbor for 
the past 17 years. Snowman’s post is mandated by an 
act of Congress, which made Boston Light, the oldest 
lighthouse in the country, a kind of antiquarian simula-
tion of what it once was.

Boston Light’s old Fresnel lens shines a warm beam 
for 20 miles more than is needed to bring ships into 
port, but, according to Snowman, its intensity feeds a 
longing in the psyche, its sweeping rays coming down 
“like a shield to the horizon.” The light “means many 
things to people on metaphysical and spiritual levels,” 
she told me, “and they don’t want to see that go.” For 
an opening bid of 10,000 clams, they don’t have to. 

The National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act 
of 2000 set off a surge in the buying of derelict light-
houses: Southwest Ledge Light was auctioned off, in 
2016, to Beacon Preservation, which owns lighthouses 
up and down the Atlantic seaboard, and the Werth 
Family Foundation; earlier this year, Chesapeake Bay 
Lighthouse, offshore in Baltimore, was sold to a private 
buyer for upwards of $60,000; and there are now five 
lighthouses on the Great Lakes alone up for auction. 
Some bid for their beauty, others for what they hope 
they might reveal.

Tonight in New Haven Harbor, having slept through 
the day, Southwest Ledge Light’s lamp will spin. 
Tomorrow night it will do the same. And seemingly for-
