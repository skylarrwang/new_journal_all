hen I was in middle school, back in Salt 
Lake City, my saxophone teacher used to 
recline in his ergonomic wheelie chair, 
rest his interlocked fingers on his gut, and tell me I 
was special. Sometimes, he would spend the entirety 
of our allotted hour telling me so. Caroleine, you’ve 
got a gift. Caroleine, you’ve got style. Caroleine, your 
tone is exceptional. This pedagogical approach irri-
tated me, not because it was unhelpful, but because it 
was redundant. I already knew I was special. I was the 
most complex, interesting, talented, attractive person 
in my acquaintance, possibly the entire world. When 
Kate Moss was fourteen, she had bow-legs and crooked 
teeth. When Joseph Smith was fourteen, he couldn’t 
even spell “arithmetic.” At fourteen, I had clear skin, a 
4.0 GPA, and the biggest boobs in my immediate fam-
ily. I could (and often did) use “defenestrate” in a sen-
tence. My theophany was just around the corner. 
To pass the time until cosmic forces swept me into 
a new life, my teacher encouraged me to audition for 
Caleb Chapman’s Little Big Band. Caleb Chapman 
was Glenn Miller for Mormon kids. His twenty-two-
piece youth swing band practiced forty-five minutes 
south of Salt Lake in a beige building wallpapered with 
awards, commemorative plaques, and gushy newspaper 
articles. On the first day of rehearsal, Caleb told the 
rhythm section to give him a twelve-bar blues. Twelve-
bar blues is a basic chord progression that spits you out 
where you started. Jazzified John Jacob Jingleheimer 
Schmidt. Caleb pointed at the kid next to me, the first 
chair alto saxophone. (I was sure this was a clerical 
error. He was in my seat.) I didn’t know it at the time, 
but his name was Evwan Hatch.* He was twelve years 
old with skinny calves, skinny ankles, skinny arms, and 
long, skinny fingers. Poor sacrificial lamb.
He stood up and took a deep breath. 
Usually, young saxophonists sound strangled. Their 
facial muscles struggle to prevent their bottom teeth 
from gouging their lower lip. You can hear the strug-
gle. You can hear the gurgle and buzz of excess saliva, 
the uncertain tongue, the lag time caused by groping 
fingers and a groping brain. Their teeth put pressure on 
the reed. The reed squeaks. Their swing is “ricky-ticky:” 
an onomatopoeic term for stilted spaces between notes. 
They’re in the dark, eyes closed, frantically stringing 
together one sound after another. Not all young saxo-
phonists, however, are “usual.”
Evan’s tone was steady, full, and bright like a bell. 
He flung glissandos into the air and they sounded cele-
bratory. His notes came to a point, they rose, they fell, 
they obeyed the dictates of comic timing. Imagine a 
beloved yet assertive uncle telling you a story he’s told 
a million times before. A good saxophone solo is like 
speaking without words. Evan spoke.
After Evan sat down, Caleb pointed at me. The chk 
chk chk of the drums was deafening. I tried
