an infant; the black-and-white photograph of my great-
great-grandmother Rose, or Risya, her hair wrapped, 
brows furrowed, eyes hardened into the camera. Most 
of all, I liked to look at the ship manifest, which listed 
the passengers on my great-grandfather Ari’s boat to 
New York.  

When Ari left the Russian Empire in 1912, he trav-
eled under the assumed name Yankel Kazof. Accord-
ing to family legend, he did so in order to escape the 
draft; families who had just one son could exempt that 
child, but Ari had a brother. In this telling, the Kazofs 
were either friends or neighbors without any sons to 
be drafted, or, alternatively, a family who had already 
lost a son to the military. In any case, it seems that Ari 
could not leave under his real name, which was Aaron 
Soglin, and the turn of the twentieth  century was not 
a great time to be a soldier in the Russian Army or a 
Jew in Russia, for that matter. So there he was on the 
S.S. Patricia manifest out of Hamburg: 5 feet 6 inches, 
brown hair, grey eyes, in possession of at least fifty dol-
lars. (At ten, I could have recited these attributes from 
memory.) Ari arrived at the Port of New York, from 
which he eventually made his way to Chicago. There, 
he married my great-grandmother Sarah, had three 
children, and shed the Kazof name. He went back to 
being Ari Soglin, who he was for a good four decades 
until he died of a heart attack in 1954.  

When I was born almost half a century later, my 
parents picked my last name out of a hat. Actually,  
the person who did the picking was a midwife named 
Yael Silverberg. My parents hadn’t been able to decide 
whether I would get Soglin, my dad’s name, or Pearl-
man, my mom’s; each was too stubborn to acquiesce 
to the other. Yael Silverberg plucked Soglin from the 
depths of a green Gap baseball cap and left my mom 
with a feeling of betrayal that twenty-one years later, 
still lingers. 


Over the last three decades, American genealogy 
has undergone nothing short of an explosion. A 
lot of this has to do with the Internet. JewishGen was 
founded in 1987; by the late nineties and early 2000’s, 
it had been joined by the likes of Ancestry, MyHeri-
tage, FamilyTreeDNA, Geni, RootsWeb, and 23andMe, 
not to mention newly digitized databases like the Ellis 
Island Passenger Search. The advent of DNA testing 
has attracted even more ancestry-seekers, who are 
drawn in by the allure of shiny pie charts and percent-
ages broken down to the tenth. Mokotoff has had his 
DNA tested by a number of companies, but he’s more 
interested in what the data can tell him about his living 
relatives than in determining his family’s ethnic origin. 
(Ancestry told him he was 100% “European Jewish”; 
23andMe said 99.3%.)  When he scrolls through DNA 
matches on Ancestry.com, the site can tell him how 
much DNA he shares with a relative, if that relative 
has also been tested (“287 cM across 15 segments”), and 
it can estimate the relative’s relationship to Mokotoff 
(“Third or fourth cousin”). But as Mokotoff scrolls 
through his matches, he lists off details the database 
can’t: this one’s mother is his second cousin, that  
one has a deceased father with whom he used to 
exchange letters.  

Most American Jews trying to document their ances-
try hit an immutable brick wall sometime around the 
turn of the nineteenth century. That brick wall can usu-
ally be blamed on Eastern European Jewish last names, 
or, more specifically, the utter lack of them. The pri-
mary problem with Eastern European Jewish surnames 
is that they are entirely made up. Until the beginning 
of the nineteenth  century, Ashkenazi Jews used a log-
ical but rather slippery system of patronymic naming. 
In other words, Moshe, whose father was Aaron, would 
be called Moshe ben Aaron —Moshe, son of Aaron. If 
Moshe had a son named David, David would be called 
David ben Moshe. Eventually, various European rulers 
noticed that it was rather difficult to keep track of large 
swathes of their populations if they changed their sur-
names every generation. So around the turn of the 19 
th  century, various European states began passing laws 
compelling Jews to take surnames. When Napoleon

invaded Poland in 1807, for example, he demanded the 
keeping of meticulous civil registration records. “Thank 
God for Napoleon,” Mokotoff likes to say.

But Jews were not thrilled about the prospect of 
surnames, and this general lack of enthusiasm  shone 
through in their rather haphazard approach to the pro-
cess. Sack-Pikus, the AVOTAYNU editor, describes the 
Jewish surname as a “goyishe invention forced on you 
for nefarious reasons, like taking your boys away to the 
army or taxing you.” Even once they took surnames, 
Jews felt no particular attachment to them and changed 
them with frequency, at will. Some took surnames in 
patronymic or matronymic traditions. When the come-
dian Sarah Silverman joked about an old Jew named 
“Manischewitz Gooberman,” her hyperbole wasn’t  
too far off; the surname Manischewitz comes from the 
given name Menashe, the suffix “-witz” meaning “son 
of.” Other Jews chose occupational names. Goldstein 
was a goldsmith; Fleishman a butcher. Still others took 
the names of their hometowns. Mokotoff, Gary discov-
ered, came from the name of a town near Warsaw called 
Mokotów. His great-great-great grandfather Tuvia ben 
Moshe wasn’t even from Mokotów—he lived in a neigh-
boring town called Warka—but family legend goes that 
he must’ve liked how the name sounded, which was not 
too far off from the Hebrew “ki tov,” meaning “for the 
good of God.” The name Tuvia Mokotoff, translated lit-
erally, means “God is good, for the good of God,” and 
it leads right up to Gary Mokotoff’s brick wall. Gary 
knows from a Warka death register that Tuvia’s father 
was known as Moshe Aronowicz, or Moshe, son of Aron. 
He can thus deduce that his fifth-great-grandfather’s 
first name was Aron. Aron’s ancestors are untraceable. 
A second major challenge of this entirely fabricated 
class of surnames are their spellings. Names which orig-
inated in Yiddish or Russian or Ukrainian had to be 
transliterated out of Hebrew or Cyrillic alphabets. This 
meant that names often went through the ringer once 
in ship manifests in Hamburg, the port at which many 
Jews departed from Europe, and then again, sometimes 
many times over, after those who bore them arrived in 
the States. 

It is at this point that amateur genealogists tend to 
fall back on one of the most persistent myths of Ameri-
can genealogy: they declare that their family’s name got 
changed at Ellis Island. There’s a somewhat romantic 
appeal to this narrative, but inspectors at Ellis Island did 
not even record the names of arriving passengers; they 
simply checked them against the names already listed 
on the ship manifests. Once they arrived in the Lower 
East Side, or Brooklyn, or wherever, immigrants were at 
complete liberty to change their names to whatever they 
liked, often with no legal intervention whatsoever. Jews 
occasionally lopped off errant ov’s and sky’s from their 
names in attempts at Americanization. Sometimes, 
though, they made more dramatic modifications. 

My own maternal great-grandmother was born in 
New York City as Lilly Usilewski but enrolled in pub-
lic school as a Solawisky. When her younger brother 
went to school, he was listed as Daniel Oslofsky, at 
which point their father, who’d been in the country for 
a decade or so, had apparently had enough. The judge 
he went before to change his name was called Judge 
Green, which evidently sounded nice enough to him. 
Thereafter, the Usilewski/Solawisky/Oslofskys were 
known as the Greens.  


When I ask Mokotoff about my name, he pulls out a 
big red Avotaynu-published book titled A  Dictio-
nary of Jewish Surnames From the Russian Empire. Of 
the tens of thousands of names inside, mine is not one of 
them. Mokotoff, however, is unconcerned. After some 
flipping, there, between  Tsofnos and Tsoir on page 591,

What Mokotoff 
can’t tell me is 
what my name 
means. I hardly 
even thought to 
ask the question, 
because it has 
been so 
unanswerable  
for so long.
