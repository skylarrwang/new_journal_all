EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
In the spring of 1979, Gary Mokotoff received 
an unsolicited letter from Israel. That is, the 
man  who sent it was named Israel Cohen, and 
he lived in Bat Yam, a city on the Mediterranean 
just  south of Tel Aviv. Israel had seen Gary and 
his wife Ruth’s names listed in the ’78-’79 reg-
istry for the high-IQ society Mensa, and he was 
intrigued by the couple’s surname. He’d noticed 
that there were very few people in Israel with 
the same name; in fact, he’d found only eleven 
Mokotoffs listed in the Tel Aviv telephone books. 
Perhaps driven by the unrelenting commonness 
of his own last name, Israel Cohen enclosed 
in his letter to Gary the names and addresses 
of those Israeli Mokotoffs. Gary, then living in 
New Jersey, wrote a set of eleven letters back to 
them:  “My name is Gary Mokotoff,” he remem-
bers, paraphrasing. “My family came from War-
saw. Are we related?”  

When Gary Mokotoff sent his eleven letters to 
Tel Aviv, he knew very little about his extended 
family and even less about his name. Over the 
years, acquaintances and business associates and 
even strangers had mentioned to him that they 
knew of Mokotoffs living in Buenos Aires and 
Australia and, yes, Israel. A door-to-door sales-
man had once told Gary’s mother that he’d had a 
piano teacher named Mokotoff in Berlin before 
the war. Gary didn’t know these people, and he 
certainly didn’t know if he was related to them. 
Over the last four decades, he has found over 
1,000 living members of the Mokotoff family, 
including relatives in Australia, Argentina, and 
England. He’s identified about 400 members of 
the family who died in Eastern Europe during 
the Holocaust. And of the living Mokotoffs, he 
has yet to find one who is not related to him.  

Like Israel Cohen, I’m drawn to unusual 
names. Growing up, my ears perked up at NPR 
host sign-offs: Renée Montagne, Korva Cole-
man, Ira Glass. When family friends got preg-
nant, I peppered them with baby name sug-
gestions. I spent hours surfing the database on 
babynamewizard.com, which charts the popu-
larity of given names from the 1880s to the pres-


ent. (My own doesn’t make a blip on the radar until 
the 1970s.) I can still remember the first time I met 
another Talia, at a children’s museum in Berkeley 
when I was about four. It felt like kind of a big deal 
for about half a minute, until I, most likely, slipped 
off to play. 

Even though I thought a lot about names as a 
child, I never really thought about my surname, 
except that I always thought my mom’s, Pearl-
man, sounded nicer than my dad’s, Soglin. Mostly, 
I was opposed to the sog-based nicknames of my 
dad’s side: Soggy Waffles, Soggy Pancakes, Soggy 
Cheerios. As I got older, “Soglin” started to feel a 
bit amorphous. Sometimes people thought it was 
Italian. I always told anyone who asked—not all 
that many—that it was Russian, Russian  Jewish. 
The only people I ever met with the name Soglin 
were the ones who were related to me, but I never 
dwelled on it much.

I 
am sitting with Gary Mokotoff in the fluores-
cent-lit back office of a building he shares with 
a public relations firm, in the historically Jewish 
neighborhood of Westville, in New Haven, Con-
necticut. From this room, he publishes the quar-
terly Jewish genealogical journal AVOTAYNU; 
the International Review of Jewish Genealogy. 
Avotaynu, Inc. is billed as the “leading publisher 
of products of interest to persons who are research-
ing Jewish genealogy, Jewish family trees or Jewish 
roots.” In addition to distributing the journal four 
times a year to about 1,300 subscribers, Avotaynu 
publishes an assortment of genealogical books, 
from the very general (Getting Started in Jewish 
Genealogy, which Mokotoff wrote himself) to the 
more specific (“Naturalized Jews of the Grand 
Duchy of Posen in 1834 and 1835.”) Mokotoff’s wife 
Ruth copy edits the articles to the classical tunes 
of WMNR radio. The journal’s editor, Sallyann 
Amdur Sack-Pikus, cajoled Gary into the publish-
er’s job at a genealogy conference in 1984, and she 
wields the red pen from her home in New Hamp-
shire.  

A small wooden tree hangs above Mokotoff’s 
desk. Its body has been carved in the shape of five 
names from his own extended family tree stacked 
atop each other: Mokotoff, Friedberg,  Taratotsky, 
Wlodawer, Cemnic. Gary, who was 82 when I met 
him last year but as sturdy as a tree, wears a pen in 
his front shirt pocket and a chunky gold chai neck-
lace—chai is the Hebrew word for life — that Ruth 
gave to him many years ago. Both his ring fingers 
bear gold rings: one is his wedding band, and the 
other, which sports the initials “J.M.,” belonged to 
his father Jack. One day, he will give it to his grand-
son Jackson. He sits with his legs crossed, reclining 
in his swivel chair. Sometimes when he talks about 
the Mokotoffs, he closes his eyes and lets his hands 
take over.  

Gary Mokotoff tells me how he discovered he 
was the only Gary Mokotoff in the world. The child 
of first-generation American Jews, Gary grew up on 
the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Even during 
his youth, he knew his name was uncommon. “If 
you knew a Mokotoff, you knew a relative of mine,” 
he tells me. But he never thought very hard about 
it, even though he thought hard about plenty of 
other things. Mokotoff matriculated at the Uni-
versity of Chicago at sixteen, where he studied, 
amongst other subjects, Gregor Mendel’s papers on 
fruit fly genetics, and went on to pioneer computer 
software at IBM in 1959. This was the age of punch 
cards; his first job was to write a program that would 
print out the computer’s entire memory.  

Mokotoff tells me that his interest in geneal-
ogy was sparked by “an act of God.” He was also 
interested by the release of the Roots miniseries 
in 1977, which piqued interest in ancestry-seeking 
nationwide. In any case, as he waited for the Israeli 
Mokotoffs to write back, he dove into the archives 
at the Fifth Avenue branch of the New York Pub-
lic Library and called foreign consulates, asking for 
their telephone books. He didn’t have much luck at 
first. But Mokotoff would in time become an adept 
archival researchist, gleaning many of his leads 
from the mid-19 th century Polish civil registration 
records kept on microfilm by the Church of the 
Latter-day Saints. Mormons believe that the souls 
of their ancestors can be saved after death, so they 
maintain extensive records to help members 


of the church find and baptize their relatives. The origi-
nal records, which contain some two billion names, are 
stored in a massive granite vault in a mountain range in 
Utah. They are not without controversy, because they list 
not just actual ancestors of church members but count-
less other people—including Jews—just in case their 
descendants one day convert to Mormonism. But the 
archives proved invaluable to Mokotoff. 

In his letters, Mokotoff had asked the Israeli Mokotoffs 
for details on their most immediate family members and 
ancestry, hoping to find a common connection. A few 
months later, when he started getting letters back, he 
noticed that in every family there was at least one man 
named Tuvia. Ashkenazi Jews name their children after 
deceased relatives, so this suggested that all the families 
were one family, linked together by a common ances-
tor. There was a catch, though: there had never been 
a Tuvia in Mokotoff’s own family. But—and Mokotoff 
says this is the key to most genealogical problems—it 
was all about knowing what questions to ask. He knew 
the Hebrew names of most of his family members. One 
day, speaking to a cousin of his father’s, he realized he 
didn’t know what his Uncle Joe’s Hebrew name had 
been, so he asked. His father’s cousin said,  “‘Uncle Joe? 
Oh yeah, I remember. His name was Tuvia.’” 

In the years that followed the discovery of his own 
Tuvia, Gary Mokotoff would go on to create the Jewish-
Gen Family Finder and the computer database for the 
National Registry of Jewish Holocaust Survivors, now 
housed at the Holocaust Museum on the National Mall. 
He was the first person to receive a lifetime achieve-
ment award from the International Association of Jew-
ish Genealogical Societies. The Forward has called him 
an “all-around makher,” or mover and shaker, of  Jewish 
genealogy. In 1993, Mokotoff retired from his software 
business and devoted himself to Avotaynu, which has 
always been self-sustaining but never exactly rolling in 
cash. When I ask him why he is so interested in names, 
in genealogy, he tells me that my question is a strange 
one. “It’s kind of like saying, what makes you interested 
in baseball?”  

When I was ten or so, I spent so much time brows-
ing the family tree my dad constructed on Geni.
com that he gave me my own log-in. The scans of old 
photos and memorabilia he had uploaded onto the site 
enthralled me: the sepia-toned baby photos of relatives 
I had known only with gray hair; the death certificate 
of my grandfather’s sister, who died of scarlet fever as
