and sent me out with a stare. I scurried away and 
sat in the living room, knowing that I should leave but 
not wanting to be rude and go without saying good-
bye. I could hear them in the room directly above 
me. The entire house shook with their anger. When 
the light fixture above me shattered and its pieces 
fell to the floor, I swept the glass into the trash and 
walked home.  On my way, I thought about Annie’s 
boyfriend whom she had gushed about on the phone. 
I was equal parts angry at him for managing to skip 
the whole ordeal and grateful that when it came down 
to it, it was me she wanted with her and not him. 
She married that college boyfriend five years later. 
I was a five-hour plane ride away when she went into 
labor for the first time, so I video-called in to see the 
newborn, Callie, named for Annie’s mother, whose 
full name was Calliope. A beautiful name, though I 
was tempted to ask how much say Annie had really 
had in the decision. But I could hear her mother, 
newly a grandmother, in the background of the call, 
so I held my tongue. Their second child, Adam, was 
three weeks premature and was in and out of the hos-
pital for months after the birth. I checked in most 
days, however briefly, and I swore that I would make 
the trip out to see their rapidly growing family sooner 
rather than later. But then my parents retired and 
moved to the West coast. I suddenly had even less 
reason to make the trip all the way home, which is 
how it came to be that Annie had two kids that I had 
never met, and a dead mother who I didn’t get to see 
for the last time, and colder, bonier hands than she 
had ever had before. 


At the diner, Annie orders a coffee; I ask for plain 
oatmeal and a cup of orange juice. It’s a far cry from 
our high school orders of mozzarella sticks and onion 
rings that left grease stains on our sweatshirts, or 
milkshakes and sundaes with chocolate syrup drip-
ping down mounds of ice cream. Over the meal, if 
it can be called that, our catch-up is perfunctory. We 
pay the check and for a moment, sit in silence. 
“How about we walk down to the cove? We can 
talk a bit more on the way,” I say, suddenly desperate 
to get outside. 

The day after our high school graduation, Annie 
and I ate shrooms smushed into peanut butter and 
jelly sandwiches and spent the whole day at the 
cove––really a sewage pipe that runs into a pond in 
the woods across from our high school. There’s a path 
that goes around the pond and we walked along it 
in our bare feet, luxuriating in the moss and mud 
between our toes. At some point during the day, we 
laid down in a patch of grass; I felt both nauseated 
and exhilarated by the psychedelics working their 
way through my system. I basked in my sweat and 
in Annie’s company and cried at the beauty of an 
unleashed Australian shepherd that bounded towards 
us on the path. 

It was hot that day, almost 100 degrees, and the 
east coast humidity bogged our bodies down, but we 
wore shorts and tank tops and tied our hair up. Today, 
I am wearing jeans, because it has always seemed to 
me like adult women who work don’t wear shorts––
we are allowed dresses or slacks, jeans for our casual 
outings. The walk from the diner to the cove is only

about 15 minutes and on the way I tell her about the 
kids in my 7th grade class and about my parents’ new 
retiree hobbies. When we get to the path, we sit at a 
bench that has been here for longer than either of us 
have. 
“Annie.” 
She waits. 
“I’m pregnant,” I say without looking at her. I 
hadn’t wanted to tell her that while she was saying 
goodbye to her own mother, I was in those first giddy 
stages of becoming one. The day she called to tell 
me her mom was dead, I was on my way to my first 
ultrasound. 
“I’m raising it, him or her, by myself and it’s exactly 
what I want. I’m really very happy,” I continue. I am 
met with silence and when I finally look over, Annie 
is crying. 
“I’m so happy for you,” she finally says. “I’m so 
happy for you.” 
The last time we were here together, seventeen 
years ago, we sat on this same bench. At the time, 
I was exhausted. The salt from my tears had dried 
into a barely perceptible crust around my eyes. After 
hours of sharing our every thought and marveling at 
the sights around us, Annie and I had fallen silent. 
For a moment, I had thought that maybe she was 
asleep, but then I felt her head come to my shoulder 
and her arm slink around my waist.
This time, I snake my arm behind her back and 
squeeze her torso. My neck doesn’t nestle into her 
shoulder quite as well as hers did mine when we were 
teenagers, but the heat from her body lets me know 
that this is still Annie.
