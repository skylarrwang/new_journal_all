M
y father is awake before the sun rises. My 
mother, up before both of them, labors at 
the stove. Breakfast is a plate of chilaquiles, a cup 
of Nestlé, and half a concha—a breakfast proven 
to be great for the soul, albeit not so much for the 
stomach. On the TV, the Univision weatherman 
announces the possibility of rain in the afternoon. 
It doesn’t come around often, but when it does, all 
the strawberry fields flood, making it impossible for 
agricultural laborers to work without getting—liter-
ally—stuck in the mud. My parents react quickly; 
they can get more hours in if they leave now.

As they drop their still-full plates in the sink, I drag 
myself out of bed for my first class, a 9:25 AM lecture 
that has, unfortunately, become a 6:25 AM lecture 
since I decided to enroll in my Yale courses remotely 
and ride out the pandemic at home. “Leaving 
already?” I ask them. One of the plus sides of living 
where we do—in an apartment complex that used 
to be a labor camp deep in the agricultural fields of 
Watsonville, California—is that my parents don’t 
need to drive very far to get to work, which allows 
our mornings to go by a little slower.

Today, though, it’s not the distance that they’re 
worried about, but the time. Because my parents 
get paid by the hour—$5.75 plus $1.50 per box of 
strawberries they fill—the rain is an unwelcome 
guest. True downpours can mean days before the 
ground beneath their feet is stable enough to sustain 
their work again. Perhaps selfishly, I ask it to come. 
To pour hot and hard from the sky and drench the 
earth and stop it all in exchange for a few days of 
rest. But because I know that my parents’ hands 
have never been comfortable with idleness, this 
prayer is kept between myself and the skies, and to 
them I only say, “Okay. Cuídense. Remember to 
wear your masks.”

Take care.  Over the years my parents’ bodies 
have accumulated trauma from spending their days 
upside down, bent over with their hands almost 
buried under the hot earth, laboring from sun-
rise to sunset in the unforgiving fields that we call 
home. Maybe due to pride, maybe denial, my par-
ents aren’t the type to talk about where their bodies 
carry the strain. But I can’t look away. I see it in their 
calloused hands and feet. Bruised knees. Sunburnt 
necks and the tops of their hands. My father’s swol-
len ankles. The small of my mother’s tense back. 
Everywhere I look I see evidence of bodies valued 
only for the labor that is slowly becoming their ruin.

So, I worry. I tell them to be careful because I 
know the world considers them disposable and 
because they are not. Sometimes I become frus-
trated at my parents’ optimism about their posi-
tion because I know too much to be optimistic. I 
know that although Latinx people make up only 
about a third of Santa Cruz County’s population, 
they account for over half of our COVID-19 cases. 
I know that although Watsonville residents are 
only twenty percent of the county’s population,
