n 9th grade, I briefly thought I was in love. He was 
charming and handsome, and, better yet, he was 
entirely infatuated with me. We used to sneak away 
from our classes to see each other in the single stall 
bathroom, or under the staircase in the east wing. After 
school, we went to Giant supermarket across the street 
and he would kiss me in the dry goods section at the 
back of the store. And I loved it. But then, at the end of 
sophomore year, as we sat naked and sweaty in the back-
seat of his car, he asked me to be his girlfriend. I practi-
cally leapt out into the street, pulling on my inside out 
t-shirt and sticky shorts, and said I would call him later 
that night. I didn’t call him. Instead, I spent the night at 
my friend Annie’s house. We lay in bed together eating 
salt and vinegar chips and tapioca pudding until we fell 
asleep on our bloated stomachs. 

Twenty years removed from grocery store kissing 
and the sad pock-marked faces of fourteen-year-
olds, now in the back seat of an Uber, I suddenly am 
reminded of Jeremy, that almost-boyfriend, by the 
way the driver hums to the tunes on the radio. Equal 
parts annoying and endearing. I get out of the car in 
front of Tastee Diner, the sight of which also cata-
pults me back: this time to that high school exhila-
ration and anxiety of late nights and sneaking out, 
the once in a while successful escape from parental 
surveillance. Its smell brings back even more visceral 
memories of late drunken nights. I am going to throw 
up. Annie is sitting at one of the booths towards the 
back and I manage a feeble wave before rushing into 
the bathroom to kneel over the toilet. The dampness 
of the cold floor seeps through the knees of my pants. 
I threw up in this same bathroom after my senior 
prom. I emptied out everything that I had consumed 
that night, mostly liquid, and then wiped my nose, 
washed my face, and chewed some gum before going 
back out to sit across from my date. I had ordered 
French fries and when I finished eating them, I licked 
the salt off of each finger. I thought I looked sort of 
sexy until I felt an escaping string of spit making its 
way down my chin. 

This time, after turning my insides out into a toi-
let bowl that smells distinctly of grease and shit, just 
like it did when I was sixteen, I exit the bathroom 
to Annie. We hug, and I breathe her in, revelling in 
her smell. She, too, has the same scent as always; a 
mixture of sweat and talcum powder that gives me a 
particular sense of comfort that I realize I haven’t felt 
in the five years since we’ve last seen each other. 
“You don’t know how good it is to have you here, 
Mel. I’m glad you could make it,” she says. 
“Of course.” I don’t know what else to say, so I slide 
into the booth and stare down at the lard and syr-
up-slicked menu, not interested in opening it because 
that would involve touching the dirty plastic. I don’t 
think I could stomach the feeling of that peculiar mix 
of slime and stickiness on my fingertips.
“Anyone else coming from high school?” 
Annie shifts in her seat at my question and gives 
me a tight-lipped smile before answering. 
“Actually, it’s going to be pretty small. Mostly fam-
ily. A few of her friends.” 
“Of course,” I say, “Seems like what she would 
have wanted.” 

At this, she grimaces a bit and lets out a sound from 
the back of her throat that is closer to a bark than a 
laugh. 
“I’m not sure about that, but it’s what’s easiest for 
us, and I suppose that counts for something,” she says. 
“Aw Annie, I’m sorry. I’m fucking this all up, aren’t 
I? I want to say the right thing. But… well, I’ve never 
had a friend lose a parent. This feels weird. I’m sorry–
–” 
“It’s okay. It’s really okay.” 
She takes my hands in hers and her palms are 
damp. She squeezes my fingers and they burn under 
her clammy grasp. “Why don’t you tell me about you? 
We can talk about my mom later, but, honestly, I’m 
already feeling funeral fatigue and the damn thing 
hasn’t even happened yet. What I really want is to 
hear about you.” 

Her bony fingers still grip mine and I wonder if 
my hands are fatter. I wonder if she can tell that I’ve 
gained weight, not just in my belly, but all over, a 
little bit of extra padding for my sharp edges. My body 
is baby proofing itself, taking a lead from what I’ve 
read in countless parenting prep books: cover the fur-
niture corners, the electrical sockets, anything that 
might hurt a blundering and curious child. The extra 
fat around my bones preemptively protects what is 
growing inside of me. 

When I returned home from my first semester 
at college, I drove Annie to the Planned Parent-
hood clinic forty-five minutes from where we lived. 
Unplanned pregnancy was scary, but not unheard of 
in our town. Annie left the clinic emptied of what 
had been there when we arrived, but with a compre-
hensive plan for more reliable birth control. 

That weekend, Annie’s mom was away working as 
a flight attendant for an international trip, so we had 
the house to ourselves. We spent both days sprawled 
on her bed watching reality T.V. about young, hot 
people somehow finding love through a series of 
inane challenges––obstacle courses, trivia, all sorts 
of multi-round games. We painted our nails hot pink 
and green, and made lumpy face masks from a recipe 
we found in a two-year-old copy of Teen Vogue. For 
dinner, we ordered pizza and even indulged in extra 
garlic sauce, sopping it up with the crusts until they 
were soggy. At night, with our limbs nestled against 
each other, Annie kicked me in her sleep. When we 
woke up, the blanket that we had both fallen asleep 
under covered only me. 

Annie’s mom came home Sunday night and roused 
us from the near-catatonic state that had gripped us 
both all weekend. I had spent many high school 
nights at Annie’s and when her mom was home, she 
would turn on the radio, and sing and dance around 
the kitchen while she cooked. When I stayed late 
and ate dinner with them, the three of us sat cross-
legged on the couch and slurped soup or rice and 
curry or spaghetti from purple plastic bowls. This 
time, though, she came home and slammed the door 
so hard that the house shuddered. 
“Annie––did you start boiling some water like I 
asked?” 
Annie had not, she had not even seen the text from 
her mother. Her mom came into Annie’s bedroom
