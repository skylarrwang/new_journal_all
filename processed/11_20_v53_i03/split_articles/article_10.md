to recall some shred of wisdom from my teacher, but 
all I could come up with was, “Caroleine, you’ve got 
a gift.” To me, music was a piece of paper with notes 
on it, handed down by a higher power and polished in 
advance through intensive practice. None of this off-
the-cuff, stand-and-deliver nonsense. I sat out the jam 
session. 


From that day onward, Evan Hatch ruled my mind. 
He didn’t know it, but the two of us were locked in 
mortal combat: he, the cruel musical tyrant, I, the lov-
able and soon-to-be-triumphant underdog. I started 
practicing every day. I practiced in the basement and 
in my grandpa’s car. I ran scales like I was supposed 
to, worked my long tones, did that weird little waaaaa-
hyayayayaya vibrato exercise. I practiced with a stack 
of Jamey Aebersold books. After Jamey’s monotone 
“Ah one. Ah two. Ah one. Two. Three. Four,” I would 
offer up a joyless rendition of “Song For My Father.” I 
didn’t know if I was getting better because I couldn’t 
hear myself. My deafening inner monologue drowned 
out the sound of the chord changes: what’s the third 
in Eb7 wait don’t play the third that’s too obvious wait 
you missed it now we’re in Db7 what’s the third in Db7 
wait. 


The band met every week. After a couple of months, 
the rhythm section was “in pocket”1 and the 
horns “attacked together.” One afternoon, 
Caleb paused rehearsal to ask each student who 
their musical inspiration was. Michael Brecker, 
Max Roach, Dave Brubeck, Wycliffe Gordon, 
Freddie Hubbard. . .  Sitting there, listening to 
the litany of unfamiliar names, I realized that I 
didn’t know beans about jazz. I could name one 
jazz song I enjoyed (“Minnie the Moocher”), 
and that was only because it included the word 
“hoochie-coocher.” Evan liked Kenny Garrett. 
Evan Hatch, seventh-grader from American 
Fork, UT, actually listened to experimental 90’s 
post-bop with titles like “Sing a Song of A Song.” 
On purpose. 


Saxophone was my fourth favorite hobby. The 
coveted first place spot was reserved for standing 
naked in front of the bathroom mirror and pre-
tending I was on Jimmy Fallon. 
JIMMY: Caroleine, I absolutely adore your 
latest album, Special Girl. I hear the critics 
adore it too. Can you tell us a bit about your 
musical journey? 
ME: Well, Mr. Fallon—
JIMMY: Call me Jimmy. 
ME: Well, Jimmy, I may be a famous female 
saxophonist, but my road has not been an easy 
one. When I was fourteen, this kid named 
Evan Hatch punched me in the face and called me 
a bitch and said I’d never amount to a thing. I wanted 
to defenestrate him, but of course, my higher self pre-
vailed. Evan, if you’re watching this—


Evan Hatch was unaware of my underdog narra-
tive and selfishly refused to conform to it. First of all, 
he was two years younger than me—a big difference 
when you’re in middle school. Second of all, he was a 
nice person, the kind of nice you have to be when you 
have ten siblings. His laughter was high-pitched and 
1 This is a very technical jazz term. It means grooving, vibing etc. 
You know it when you hear it.

frequent. He wore a uniform, cartoon-character style: 
thick-rim glasses, Brigham Young University t-shirt, tan 
cargo shorts, white tube socks pulled all the way up. He 
was sweet. And I hated him anyway. 


The Little Big Band experience culminated in the 
Peaks Jazz Festival, an annual event that drew musi-
cians from all over the country. Peaks was my last shot 
to turn my jazz career into an inspirational drama à la 
Chariots of Fire. Initially, I planned to play the most 
exquisite alto-sax solo ever to grace human ears, the 
kind of solo that would make Charlie Parker rise from 
his grave, hand me a Selmer Mark VI, and tell me, 
“You’ve got it, kid.” As Peaks approached, my standards 
dropped. A month away, I was willing to settle for mak-
ing Caleb cry—still a difficult feat since big band solos 
are only twelve bars. A week away, I had pared down my 
goal to “I will play a solo that doesn’t make the audi-
ence walk out en masse.” The night before the concert, 
I decided it would be better for everyone if I didn’t play 
a solo at all. I found myself back where I started: sitting 
meekly in second chair, listening as Evan caressed my 
cheek and tucked a stray piece of hair behind my ear. 
Musically, of course. Music was the only sexy thing 
about him. 


He was too squirrelly to oppress me, too comical to 
bully me, too talented to lose my imaginary competi-
tion.
Evan, if you’re reading this, no hard feelings, okay? 
You can have jazz. It’s a dying art form anyway. Plus, 
I’m going to write the next great American novel. 
So suck it.
Bitch.
