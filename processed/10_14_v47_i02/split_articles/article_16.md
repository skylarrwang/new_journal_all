focus on learning without worrying about his safety, 
so he left after fourth grade and enrolled in Saint 
Aedan’s, a Catholic school. He was one of only two 
black students, and he recalls an incident in sixth 
grade when a student reading aloud from the textbook 
read the word “Negro.” Abdussabur raised his hand 
to correct him.
“Now, it’s colored, not Negro,” Abdussabur said.
The teacher shushed him, but Abdussabur 
continued to shout out “colored” each time he 
heard “Negro.” Eventually, his teacher kicked him 
out of the classroom.
Abdussabur scowls as he impersonates her, 
“You’re a disgrace to your race! Martin Luther King Jr. 
would be rolling in his grave!” 
The memory stings, and he pauses for a moment. 
Then his liveliness returns, and he chuckles, “I think I 
might have spent all of sixth grade in the hall!”  
Abdussabur thrived at Notre Dame, a private, 
Catholic, high school in West Haven where he ran 
track, studied painting, and conducted the school 
orchestra. Most of his peers were white, but “at 
Notre Dame, you were a Notre Dame Knight first 
and foremost,” he says. “They made no distinction 
between black and white. They only cared about the 
green and yellow.” 
Abdussabur maintained friendships with both 
black and white students all through high school. He 
recalls how he once went fishing with a white friend 
from Notre Dame. On the boat, they ate ravioli out of 
a can and drank blackberry brandy. Meanwhile, few 
of his black friends were making it beyond the city 
limits. These different experiences, he said, made him 
“culturally limitless.” He was learning how to connect

with people, regardless of their class or race, which 
would serve him well on the streets of Dixwell.
After winning a Congressional art award for 
one of his acrylic paintings, Abdussabur was offered 
a scholarship to the Rhode Island School of Design. 
He chose instead to accept a track scholarship at the 
University of West Georgia. His stepfather had devel­
oped a drinking problem, and he was ready to get 
away from home. 
At the University of West Georgia, Abdussabur 
led a successful campaign to convince the university 
to divest from South Africa to protest apartheid. He 
also served as head of the Black Student Alliance. But 
Abdussabur recalls a staggeringly high dropout rate 
among black students after freshman year.
The university’s dean quickly became acquainted 
with Abdussabur, who was 
known for stirring up trou­
ble with his activism. In 
his junior year, his scholar­
ship funds disappeared due 
to issues with the paper­
work, he said, forcing him 
to leave.
After 
leaving 
West 
Georgia, he used his last $300 
to start Boldminds, an art and 
literature publishing com­
pany still in existence today. 
They also produced wooden 
medallions bearing nation­
alist African images such 
as Nefertiti heads and portraits of Nelson Mandela. 
Within three years, he had sold over 10,000 medal­
lions. He saw the objects as something that “people 
could hold onto and talk about and discuss,” prompting 
new conversations.
Abdussabur returned to New Haven early in 1991, 
only to find it devastated by the crack epidemic. He was 
shocked by how much the city had changed. “It was 
like a nuclear narcotic zone,” he says. He observed dis­
turbing police brutality at the time, which motivated 
him to form the Civilian Review Board to monitor the 
policy department.
The then-police chief Nicholas Pastore was look­
ing to restructure the department and recruit more 
community policemen. He asked Abdussabur if he 
was interested in becoming a cop. Abdussabur said 
yes, and with that, he joined the ranks of the very 
institution that so frustrated him. “I put on armor to 
help our community recover,” he says. 
In his first year as a police officer, he participated 
in the Yale Child Study Officer Fellowship program. 
He and the other participants would meet with Yale 
clinicians to address traumatic exposure to violence in 
children and families. After Abdussabur had spoken in 
a meeting, a white Yale clinician commented, “Wow! 
You’re amazingly articulate!” Though she intended it as 
a compliment, Abdussabur was insulted and shocked. 
“Being black and successful in America should not be 
a surprise to anybody,” he says. He calls that kind of 
“cultural disconnect” an “invisible barrier” between 
communities, one of many that he encounters. But he 
doesn’t let these things stand in his way. “Because I 
refused to recognize those invisible barriers, I didn’t 
create my own barriers.”
Of the fifty-five male students 
in CTRibat’s 2006 summer pilot 
program, approximately ninety-
five percent resided in Dixwell. 
Seventy-one percent lived in a 
single parent family, and nearly 
three-fourths lived in households 
where the total yearly income 
was under $25,000.
Abdussabur 
explains 
that 
about ninety percent of the 
African-American males who 
die by gun violence are shot 
within three blocks of where they grew up or where 
they live. These teenagers live in small worlds. Gang 
boundaries, police violence, probation measures, 
security concerns, and social status confine their 
movement. Just venturing beyond the block can be 
dangerous. So he takes them on trips outside of the 
city. Abdussabur raises his arms up over his head in 
a sweeping gesture and booms, “Camping takes 
you out!”
But then he gets serious and puts his hands in his 
lap. “There are so many nice places in New Haven for 
young people to experience,” he adds. “It’s a tragedy 
that so many African-American young men in the city 
only get to experience the dark side of New Haven.” 
Abdussabur ensures that his own children participate 
in these programs, too. He tells them, “You’re not bet­
ter than these kids, you’re just better off.”


HE RETURNED TO 
NEW HAVEN IN 1991, 
ONLY TO FIND IT 
DEVASTATED BY THE 
CRACK EPIDEMIC. 
... “IT WAS LIKE A 
NUCLEAR NARCOTIC 
ZONE.”


In addition to camping, CTRibat participants do 
artwork, go to the movies, and talk about anything 
and everything, from racial profiling to how they’re 
doing in school. By exposing them to different types 
of activities, Abdussabur says, the program provides 
alternatives to violence. In 2005, Abdussabur also 
founded New Haven Guardians, a fraternal organiza­
tion of Elm City African-American officers who host 
activities with CTRibat.
One goal guides Abdussabur’s work. “I aim to 
reduce the sea of agitation between law enforcement 
and the urban community and use anxiety reduc­
tion to empower that community,” Abdussabur says, 
his voice rising. “Right now, young black males feel 
oppressed, not empowered. No one is walking you 
through what to do when the police stop you. That’s 
not empowerment. That’s a set-up. That’s dangerous.” 
In the first half of 2014, seven homicides and thirty 
non-fatal shootings were reported 
in New Haven. In just two and a 
half weeks between Aug. 1 and Aug. 
18, 2014, there were four reported 
homicides and five non-fatal shoot­
ings. Almost all of the victims were 
people of color.
As both a resident of the city 
and a policeman entrusted to 
keep the city safe, Abdussabur 
seeks to address these racial con­
flicts by bridging the gap between 
the community and the police 
department. Doug Bethea, a community activ­
ists, and founder of the Nation Drill and Drum 
Squad Corps, a youth mentoring program that 
teaches kids discipline through percussion music, 
first met Abdussabur fifteen years ago. Abdussabur, 
Bethea says, was always looking for ways to engage 
the community.
“Shafiq is the perfect model for [community 
policing], plain and simple.” Bethea said. He thinks 
that other officers in the force have learned from 
Abdussabur to overcome the tension and mistrust 
that exists between officers and residents. Even sim­
ple things—like buying a kid a pair of shoes, host­
ing a Christmas party, or helping someone with a 
job search—can have a big impact. Bethea, who dealt 
with the death of his own son by gun violence, says, 
“I know his kids, he knows my kids… he was work­
ing for me, speaking up for me.”
As his career progressed, Abdussabur turned to 
writing to share his insights and knowledge with 
a larger audience. His 2009 book, A Black Man’s 
Guide to Law Enforcement in America, recounts 
multiple instances of police shootings and arrests 
involving unarmed black males. It also offers 
practical advice about avoiding run-ins with the 
criminal justice system.
Many incidents of police violence, he writes, 
occur because of “an officer’s inability to identify, 
understand, and effectively communicate with a spe­
cific population (commonly Black) within the urban 
sectors of the United States.”
This communication difficulty stems in part from 
stereotypes that police officers have of black men and 
that black men reinforce.
“Not only are you driving the car smoking weed, 
but you’re blasting music, you have a funky attitude, 
and then when the police do pull 
you over, you wanna go into a 
whole debate,” Abdussabur said.  
“That behavior feeds into the 
stereotype that sets you up for 
the profile of a criminal. Now 
I’m not saying that I agree with 
that profile. But it is the profile 
that is currently being fed to law 
enforcement.” 
He said that police offi­
cers get most of their train­
ing on the job. So when 
young black men behave poorly with police, 
they are training police to believe that they 
are causing trouble.
“Don’t give the police ammunition,” he laughs. 
“They’ve got enough!” 
The book also offers guidance for those already 
charged with an offense. “Wear a lot of deodorant 
[in court] because you will probably be nervous… 
Do not wear gold fronts (gold teeth inserts)… the 
more conservative your hair style, the better,” he 
writes. “They don’t deal with you based on what 
you know; they deal with you based on what they 
know.” It’s the black male’s job, he says, to avoid pro­
jecting an image that aligns with the jury’s racialized 
conceptions—a misunderstanding that often ends 
with a guilty verdict.
His philosophy can be controversial. “Some 
black politicians in general have not agreed with
