my approach to addressing racial profiling by plac­
ing some of the ownership on the black community,” 
he concedes. Abdussabur admits that his solutions are 
most often embraced by white suburbanites, African-
American women, and African-American men 35 
years or older. But for his target audience—young 
black males—this issue is subject to debate. 

Some of Abdussabur’s colleagues also disagree 
with his no-excuses approach. Barbara Fair, a good 
friend of Abdussabur and a grassroots advocate for 
criminal justice and prison reform, mentions an inci­
dent between her daughter and a New Haven police­
man. As her daughter was driving to class at Gateway 
Community College, the policeman approached her 
without reason. Worried about being late to class, 
she threw her hands up in frustration. The police­
man asked her if she had a problem, to which she 
replied, “No, do you have a problem?” He grabbed 
the handle of her car door, which, she said, was, 
thankfully, locked. 

“Shafiq might have told her ‘don’t say nothing,’” 
Fair laughs. “But I don’t have that mentality. I don’t 
feel obligated to respect the man in blue if he doesn’t 
respect me back.” 

Preventing these incidents from happening 
in the first place, Abdussabur emphasizes, is ideal. 
“Before the disaster happens, what can we do?” 
he asks. 

But now, eighteen months away from retirement, 
Abdussabur said that family and school are at the cen­
ter of his life. Abdussabur is currently finishing his 
degree at Charter Oak State College in New Britain. 
He also plans to do more writing and consulting that 
will address racial profiling.

Despite the success of Abdussabur’s programs, 
New Haven and the rest of the country have a long 
way to go. Ferguson, he says, was a wake-up call. 
He shuffles some paper on the desk and looks me 
straight in the eye. “We’re procrastinating, and we’ve 
got work to do.”
