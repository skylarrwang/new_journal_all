the past, the trust that sirs and boys 
had developed through sex natu­
rally lent itself to creating tight-
knit groups of leathermen who 
could help each other evade the 
morality police of earlier decades. 
“Thirty years ago, being a 
boy was a completely different 
experience. There were bound­
aries. Boys knew their place and 
sirs knew their place,” one of the 
older men in the circle comments. 
Relics from this era are still pres­
ent in modern leather culture. The 
sir-boy hierarchy is an obvious 
example, but not the only one. 
At the conference, men also have 
handkerchiefs peeking out from 
their pockets, and leather bands 
around their wrists. Many wear 
either a Muir cap or a padlock col­
lar. The accessories were originally 
covert signals to other leathermen. 
The color of the handkerchief told 
others what sexual act you were 
interested in, while the hand on 
which you wore your leather band 
would communicate whether you 
were dominant or submissive. 
Boys wore padlock collars to signal 
that they were “collared,” or in a 
relationship with a sir, while sirs 
would wear Muir caps as a symbol 
of their position.

With anti-sodomy laws now 
struck down and gay marriage 
gaining legal recognition across 
the country, leather and BDSM 
have become much more socially 
acceptable. As a result, the preex­
isting leather community is facing 
an onslaught of newcomers who 
know nothing about the old cus­
toms. A common complaint is that 
leathermen now indiscriminately 
don the Muir caps, which they 
once had to earn the right to wear. 
The padlock collars that formerly 
symbolized a close bond between 
a sir and his boy have been reduced 
to trinkets that people lock and 
unlock on a whim. Yet correcting 
new members’ faux pas is a chal­
lenge, in part because fewer mem­
bers of the Old Guard remain: “We 
lost a whole generation of people 
to the AIDS scourge,” Bielski notes. 
Social media has also taken 
a toll on leather culture. Where 
it was once necessary to become 
involved with a leather group in 
order to meet potential partners, 
social apps for gay men such as 
Grindr and Recon make it easy to 
find a hookup without joining the 
leather community. Leather gay 
bars, where people used to min­
gle, are slowly falling out of use. 
“People just want to get their fan­
tasy over with and then go home,” 
Jones laments.  One-night stands, 
of course, are not conducive to 
building the sort of trust that 
BDSM requires, but the Internet 
makes them easier to arrange—
and makes BDSM becomes more 
dangerous. Agreeing to let some­
one tie you up and whip you after 
meeting online can be a recipe 
for disaster. 
 Members of the Old Guard 
have founded fraternal organiza­
tions such as CT Cruisers and the 
Leather Boys of New England in 
order to pass down traditions, but 
they are fighting an uphill battle. 
Still, some members of the New 
Guard embrace their customs. 
“The Old Guard is really impor­
tant to me because they have our 


roots, but the New Guard is also 
important because we need to 
accept the new generation. I 
believe in Old Guard and New 
Guard,” Boots says proudly.


Ten hours later, we’re back 
at 168 York Street Café for the 
Mr. Connecticut Leather competi­
tion. The building is packed with 
a menagerie of prominent fig­
ures from every corner of New 
England’s LGBTQ scene. There are 
not just leather boys and sirs; bears, 
cubs, drag queens, monarchs, pups, 
and rubbermen crowd around the 
stage in the café’s patio. Trying to 
discern everyone’s titles and affili­
ations is an impossible exercise in 
queer taxonomy. 

The contest was supposed 
to start at 9 p.m. It’s now 10:15, 
and blood alcohol levels have 
risen. But the bacchanalian feel 
of the night is interrupted when 
the pageant begins, unexpectedly, 
with a eulogy. David Murphy, Mr. 
Connecticut Leather 2006, walks 
onto the narrow stage in formal 
leatherwear. His stage fright is 
visible as he clutches the micro­
phone, looks down at his typed-
out speech, and begins: “On the 
whole, we’re a pretty hardy bunch. 
It’s pretty much impossible to kill 
us. But hey, we lost one of our own 
last year. It’s been a very hard time 
for a lot of us, and I’m going to tell 
you a story.” 

Jayson Scott, Mr. Connecticut 
Leather 2007, passed away in 
2013 from colon cancer. Scott and 
Murphy’s friendship spanned over 
ten years, and Murphy recounts 
how their lives intertwined—how 
Murphy calmed Scott’s nerves 
before his big speech in the 2007 
contest; how Scott used to give 
Murphy’s infant son formula on 
road trips; how Murphy held the 
sick bowl for Scott as he vom­
ited in the last twenty-four hours 
before he passed away; how, in the 
weeks afterward, Murphy had to 
hide Scott’s leather paraphernalia 
from his mother, who, even after 
her son’s death didn’t know about 
his involvement in the leather 
community. The speech ends with 
the unveiling of a disco ball, which 
Scott had requested they display 
for all future contests. After sharing 
a moment of silence, bathed in the 
ball’s glittering light, the leather­
men, bears, and drag queens, tears 
still in their eyes, join together in 
singing the national anthem. 

The rest of the pageant is far 
more light-hearted, featuring porn 
and sex toy raffles, roasts, and lip-
synced renditions of Celine Dion’s
