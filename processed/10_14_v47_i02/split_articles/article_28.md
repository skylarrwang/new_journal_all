greatest hits. Then the contest itself 
begins. The three contestants strut 
their stuff in formal wear, bottom-
less chaps, and jock straps—they 
turn around and bend over to 
show off.

But physical appearance mat­
ters little to the judges. Most impor­
tant are the interviews, held in pri­
vate earlier in the day, which ask 
the contestants about their goals in 
representing the community and 
their knowledge of leather history. 
After all, Mr. CT Leather needs to 
be an ambassador for current and 
past leather communities. 

Contestants also give a stump 
speech, and are required to tell 
a dirty story based on a prompt, 
such as: “You’re beginning a scene 
with a judge of your choice. Pick 
a kinky fetish, and include the fol­
lowing three items. The first item 
is a toilet plunger; the second item 
is a feather duster; the third item, 
three marbles.” The stories pose an 
interesting challenge for Susan, the 
sign language interpreter; sign lan­
guage is very literal when it comes 
to erotic subjects, essentially forc­
ing Susan to pantomime sex acts.

As much as this is a night to 
pick a new ambassador, it is also 
an occasion to celebrate Boots’ 
time as Mr. Connecticut Leather. 
Projected on the wall to the left of 
the stage is a slideshow dedicated 
to his year of service; he is shirt­
less in at least half the photos. “I 
want to thank the community for 
opening the door for a new jour­
ney for my life,” Boots says, on the 
verge of tears. “Thank you to the 
leather community; I got a chance 
to explore and see the person I 
really am.” 

After imploring the crowd 
to be accepting of all creeds and 
colors, he removes his sash, his 
head slightly bowed. This is the 
first time I’ve seen him without it; 
he seems mousier now. After the 
crowd takes a moment to cheer, 
the contestants walk onto the stage 
to hear the results. When the win­
ner, David Gerard, is named, Boots 
takes another sash and wraps it 
around the new Mr. Connecticut 
Leather. He gives each contestant a 
hug, raises his hands in applause, 
and exits stage right. 

At 11 a.m. the Sunday after the 
competition, the Imperial Court, 
the Hartford-based drag group, 
holds a victory brunch at the café 
to celebrate Gerard’s title. It’s a 
smaller 
affair—around 
twenty 
people sharing mimosas and eat­
ing eggs and sausage off of alumi­
num trays. Even with the smaller 
crowd, the Court still puts on a 
revue of lip-syncing cross-dressers 
and bears. 

It is difficult to say whether Mr. 
Connecticut Leather, as an institu­
tion, can bring back the decorum 
and values that leather culture has 
lost over the years. In an age when 
leather newcomers are either 
ignorant or uninterested in the 
culture’s foundations, and kinky 
hookups require only a few key­
strokes, Mr. Connecticut Leather 
might be swimming upstream. 

But Boots and Jones and countless 
others are not about to give up and 
allow leather to be reduced to just 
another fetish. For them, being a 
leatherman is so much more.

Toward the end of the pro­
ceedings, the MCs call Boots to 
the stage again. Arsenio Amadis, 
a former leather champion in 
New York and Boots’s close friend, 
declares: “We’re going to cover 
Omar today.” The term “cover” 
refers to the donning of the Muir 
cap. The leather brim may be flip­
pantly worn elsewhere, but at CT 
Leather events, it is given only to 
sirs who demonstrate exceptional 
dedication to the community. 

Boots kneels before Amadis, who 
places the cap upon his head like 
a crown and announces to the 
audience, “I now present to you, 
Sir Omar.” The cap is primarily a 
symbol of his dedication to his 
charitable work—but the fun of 
the pageantry is never lost.
