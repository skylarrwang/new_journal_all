deteriorate under their domes. 

We walk around the bend to find 
a sign that says: “JESUS IS LAID 
IN THE TOMB.” Unlike most of 
the structures, the building here 
is human-sized, and in relatively 
good repair. Mounds of pine nee­
dles weigh down the corrugated 
roof and the supports are more 
arch than wall, but the mother and 
daughter poking around the tomb 
don’t seem too worried about its 
structural integrity.  

Despite the recent improve­
ments, Holy Land USA still feels 
like it’s stuck in an abandoned 
past—except for the cross, which 
stands at the top of Pine Hill, sur­
rounded by a fence that reads “Our 
Lady of Peace.” The cross is 52 feet 
high and 26 feet wide, illuminated 
by thousands of LED lights, which 
change color with the liturgical 
season. A little way down from 
the hilltop, another, identical cross 
lies face down on the ground next 
to its support system. “That one 
didn’t work,” I hear someone 
explain. From the outside, it looks 
like a fully functional piece. Like 
the other cross, it would have been 
a spiritual symbol visible for miles 
around—if it weren’t for some 
serious flaw.

From Pine Hill’s summit, the 
town of Waterbury looks like 
another small diorama. There is 
St. Anne’s, the Neo-Gothic church 
where the shuttle picked us up, 
and there is the interstate.  On 
December 22 of last year, the road 
overlooking I-84 was closed, and 
thousands of people gathered on 
the bridge to watch as the cross 
was lit for the first time in decades. 
“I’ll be honest, that cross lit at 
night says it all for me,” Pagano 
said, recalling a recent flight back 
to Connecticut. “I’m looking down 
at Connecticut when we’re start­
ing to come down. The first thing 
I recognize, I see that brand new 
cross lit...you know where you’re 
at from twelve thousand feet up.”

As we make our way to the 
park’s chapel, we stop in front 
of the “HOLY LAND U.S.A.” sign, 
white letters with blue edges, out­
lined with drooping Christmas 
lights. 
Comparisons 
to 
the 
Hollywood sign are both unfair 
and unavoidable. At the foot of 
the sign, concrete garden edging 
spells out “HONOR GOD,” form­
ing a trinity with the sign and cross 
in the background. 

The Mass begins at 3:30 p.m., 
and the small chapel is packed with 
hundreds of people. It is a long 
white room with a low ceiling, 
wooden pews, and stained glass 
awning windows—all of them 
with the same design: a crown 
and cross. There are parents with 
children and elderly couples, com­
munity leaders and students from 
the rival Catholic high schools. A 
sort of Christian pop-punk music 
plays as we walk in. Then the Mass 
begins: prayers, songs, a hom­
ily, and Communion. Holy Land, 
the priest explains, is a testament 
to the power of community. After 
the service, Mayor O’Leary gives 
a speech, thanking the hundreds 
of Waterbury residents who have 
supported this project. 

It wasn’t that surprising to 
me that a cross glows in the hills 
overlooking a Connecticut town, 
or that there’s a Christian theme 
park with a sign modeled after 
Hollywood’s. That just seems 
like one natural development of 
religious observance in the U.S. 
What caught me off-guard was 
how handmade Holy Land is: 
the carefully lettered signs, the 
chicken-wire buildings. The decay. 
Sixty years ago, one man wanted 
to create something holy, so he 
built a replica of Bethlehem out 
of plaster and scrap materials. And 
when other people saw what Greco 
was doing, it became sacred to 
them, too.

After the mass, a group of 
Catholic high school students 
ends the festivities by releas­
ing a flock of white doves into 
the air. Members of the crowd 
turn their heads to watch before 
piling back into the buses and 
heading down the hill.
