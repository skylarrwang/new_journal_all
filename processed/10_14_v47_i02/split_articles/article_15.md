O
n a Tuesday afternoon in September, Shafiq 
Abdussabur stands transfixed by one image on 
the wall of his office. It’s a hazy photograph of six 
boys playing tug-of-war, their smiles wide, their eyes 
focused on victory.
“We lost him,” Abdussabur says, pointing to 
the boy leading the pack. “He was killed two years 
after this photo was taken. And him, too,” he adds, 
pointing to another boy. Abdussabur’s own son, 
now 18, is also in the photo, standing near the oth­
ers. “I wish I could have saved every kid. I saved the 
ones that I could.”
Abdussabur proceeds to dig into boxes on 
the floor and pull out old issues of the New Haven 
Register. They date from 2007 to 2009, and all of 
them tell stories of shootings. One of the articles is 
about Abdussabur’s cousin. She was shot and killed 
just two blocks from his office on Ashmun Street. In 
Abdussabur’s city, violence is personal.
The tug-of-war photo was taken on a camping trip 
with CTRibat, a violence prevention program for youths 
aged 8 to 14 that Abdussabur founded in 2006. “Ribat” 
means “retreat” in Arabic; the program’s name stands 
for “Children and Teen Retreat.” The program is dedi­
cated to building boys’ confidence and self-respect, to 
help them deal with the challenges of life in an urban 
setting without becoming involved in guns, gangs, 
or drugs.
CTRibat is just one of the many social pro­
grams Abdussabur has implemented during his 
career. He is a Dixwell beat cop, spending his days 
walking around the neighborhood and getting 
to know its residents. In his off hours, he works 
on solutions to the problems he sees every day in 
the streets. 
Abdussabur now lives in Beaver Hills, a New 
Haven neighborhood west of Dixwell, with his wife, 
Mubarakah Ibrahim, who is a personal trainer, and 
their four children. He was born in 1967, when his 
mother was 15 years old. Abdussabur grew up “like 
an outdoors kid,” growing up on his grandparents’ 
farm in West Haven, he says. At the time, long before 
his conversion from Baptist Christianity to Islam, 
he went by the name Thomas Fulcher Johnson. He 
spent a lot of time with his grandparents while his 
mother worked as a teacher’s aide. Wiggling his 
shoulders and sitting up in his chair with pristine 
posture, he says his grandmother always carried her­
self like “an aristocrat,” even though she didn’t finish 
eighth grade. Abdussabur spent childhood mornings 
with her, drinking coffee from fine china mugs and 
reciting his prayers.
When Abdussabur was just 5 years old, his 
mother brought him to a Black Panther rally on the 
New Haven Green. The police were there, “Ferguson-
style,” he recalls. Abdussabur considers his mother’s 
participation in activism as his “blueprint for social 
justice work.”
At his elementary school, Helene Grant School, 
fights broke out frequently. He wanted to be able to
