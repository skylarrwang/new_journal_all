EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
One of the students is wearing a grey sheath dress, 
her smooth blond hair tied back in a bun. The girl’s 
fancy new nude patent leather pumps have given 
her a blister, and at one point she texts Steinberg, who 
is helping coordinate the event, to ask if she has a 
Band-Aid. She tells me that she attends the affluent 
Greenwich High School and that she’s applying early 
to Princeton. She has an edge up, because one of her 
parents went there.


This girl’s background confirms what I’ve heard 
about debate culture outside UDL. Zelinsky, the 
founder of UDL, told me, bluntly, “Debate’s a rich 
kids’ sport.” In some way, Yale Debate Association 
capitalizes on the market of kids who are will­
ing to fly across the country to compete; the asso­
ciation organizes the Invitational in part to fundraise 
for their own collegiate competitions. However, at 
Steinberg’s suggestion, the YDA instituted a policy 
that allows some students to waive the tournament 
entry costs, which run $60 to $90 per team.


Xavier starts to flirt with the blonde girl. 
He asks her what the difference is between 
Connecticut Debate Association kids and UDL kids. 
“We’re cooler,” she says, teasing. “What! No,” Xavier 
replies, “We’re the home team!” 


“Let me just explain to you what the social con­
tract is,” says Zariah, as she faces Matt and Jack back 
in the Kline Biology Tower and begins to take a
part their argument.


She criticizes their blinkered vision in foreign 
policy. “So the first point we have is diplomacy,” she 
begins. “Side Government would have you think that 
there’s no other option besides flying over China and 
pissing China off.” Her style is elevated where it has 
to be, but also to the point.


She tells me at the debate camp she’d attended, 
they’d taught her four ways to refute an argument. It 
could be wrong in itself: self-contradictory and invalid. 
It could be unsound: Its logic is valid, but not all of 
its premises are true. Or the claim could just be com­
pletely irrelevant. Finally, it could fail to be persuasive: 
An argument can be valid and sound, but insignificant 
compared to another, stronger argument. “My dream 
is to refute an argument in all four ways,” Zariah says, 
laughing. She comes close this time. She and Xavier 
win the debate round, but they don’t make it to finals. 
There’s a run-off, and they come out behind. 
Still, they’ve come a long way. 
ZARIAH ALTMAN AND XAVIER SOTTILE PREPARE FOR THEIR NEXT ROUND OF DEBATE.

On Friday, October 10, in William L. Harkness 
Hall, UDL has its first tournament of the season. It’s 
their largest tournament yet, with seventeen teams 
competing from nine different schools. It’s here, 
with students gathered from all over New Haven, 
that I get a sense of the community of debaters that 
UDK has built in this city. The students filter into 
the small auditorium, most in their school clothes, 
though one or two have put on a suit jacket or a skirt 
for the occasion.


Zariah greets friends from other schools, some of 
whom she’s encouraged to join the league. “I pretty 
much just yell at them until they come,” she says, 
laughing. She teases a childhood friend of hers, Kyle, 
who wants to debate her on his first round. Coming 
from Metropolitan Business Academy, which only 
started a UDL program last semester, he has never 
competed before. Tatiana, another friend, jokes, “He’s 
begging to go against her on his first debate, when 
everyone else in this room is praying not to get her!”


They do end up teamed up against one another, 
and at the end of the debate, Zariah smiles widely at 
Kyle. He looks impressed, if a little shell-shocked. “It 
was so, so great debating with you,” Zariah says to 
him, pinching his cheek affectionately.


At the awards ceremony after three rounds, Zariah 
and Xavier place first in the varsity division, though 
other students take the award for best speaker. At the 
end of the evening, the kids eat the pizza UDL has 
brought for them, and they say their good-byes to the 
kids from other schools. They won’t see them until 
the next tournament, in November. It’s dark and chilly 
outside compared to the halogen lights and central 
heating of the building. Their parents have pulled up 
their cars over on Wall Street to pick them up and 
bring them back from Yale, or they walk with their 
plastic medals around their necks over to the Green to 
catch the bus home.
Caroline Durlacher is a senior

“I 
never, in a million years, in my right mind, wanted 
to set foot in this school. Then I got here,” wrote 
Kiana M. Hernandez in the Proclamation, Wilbur 
Cross High School’s student newspaper. Hernandez, 
who is now a freshman at Yale, came to Wilbur 
Cross knowing its reputation for having kids who 
“do nothing but fight and bully and argue.” But she 
quickly found out the reputation was false. She took 
rigorous classes and joined a varsity sport team, she 
writes in the June 2014 edition. The issue includes 
everything from reviews of classic films to an edi­
torial on the high price of a college education. 
Students dressed up in prom regalia grin out from 
the cover, preparing to say goodbye to a school 
many of them are sad to leave.

What can a single grade say about a school? 
This year, Wilbur Cross earned the label “fail­
ing school” from the Connecticut Coalition for 
Achievement Now (ConnCAN), an advocacy group 
that focuses on improving public education state­
wide. When the organization created its standards-
based ranking of Connecticut public schools, it 
didn’t take school newspapers into account. It didn’t 
ask students if they liked their classmates, had close 
relationships with their teachers, or felt that they 
were being prepared well for college or the work­
force. Instead, it turned to a more simplistic metric: 
test scores. 
Since 2006, ConnCAN has published annual 
“report cards” for public schools in Connecticut. For 
the past three years, it has relied on the “School
