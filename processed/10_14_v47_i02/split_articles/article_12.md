in Bassett caught Father 
Tony Jarvis just as he 
was leaving his office at the Yale 
Divinity School last April. Jarvis 
was in a hurry, and Bassett asked 
for a second of his time. They went 
inside and sat down. After years of 
working in law, Bassett had been 
accepted into the Yale Divinity 
School, and he was visiting for 
the admitted students’ weekend. 
But he still didn’t think he could 
enroll. He was terrified of starting 
over, of leaving everything behind 
in North Carolina, the only place 
he had ever called home.
“Bassett, that’s why you have 
to come here,” Bassett remem­
bers Father Jarvis telling him. “It’s 
good that you’re afraid of it. Every 
major step in my life, I have been 
deathly afraid to do what I was 
about to do.”
Bassett is now in his sec­
ond year at Yale Divinity School 
(YDS), getting his Masters of Arts 
in Religion, with a concentra­
tion in literature. But he is also a 
Profit. Not a “prophet”—Bassett is 
a member of the Former Profits, a 
social organization at the divinity 
school that brings together stu­
dents who had previously pursued 
other careers. Members range from 
ex-bankers to ex-teachers to ex-
photographers. Some used to own 
dance studios. Others used to work 
on Wall Street. Many members are 
commuters, some from as far as 
Boston. They have left behind often-
lucrative careers for late-life study 
of theology, and Former Profits 
eases the transition.
Many Profits feel like they are 
giving up everything familiar for 
something uncertain. The partici­
pants’ desires to help each other 
through the potentially difficult 
transition serve as the foundation 
for Former Profits. Though they 
come from diverse backgrounds, 
together they can admit to their 
doubts about whether they have 
made the right choice in coming to 
divinity school.
The group recently had it 
first meeting of the year, a pizza 
lunch, in the common room of the 
Divinity School. Over lunch, the 
new students got to know return­
ing members. At the next meeting, 
a guest speaker will talk about what 
it’s like to adjust to a new career 
path, long after they thought they 
had chosen one for life.  
Bassett’s story is similar to 
those of other Profits: He moved 
from one kind of job to another 
in search of a concrete way to be 
of service. As an undergraduate, 
Bassett studied electrical engi­
neering at North Carolina State 
University, but halfway through, 
he realized that he had no inter­
est in becoming an engineer. He 
then decided to go to law school 
to become a patent attorney, which 
requires degrees in both engineer­
ing and law. He worked for eight 
months as a low level associate in a 
large international patent law firm 
in North Carolina before leaving, 
dissatisfied with the experience.
“I was tucked in an office 
writing memos that clients would 
likely never see. I wasn’t getting a 
lot of human interaction,” he said.
He left the job to work as 
an Assistant District Attorney in 
Raleigh, North Carolina. He wanted 
to become a law professor, and he 
thought the job would help him 
get there. But once again, he found 
himself dissatisfied.
“I experienced a lot of moral 
distress, particularly with young 
kids and low level drug crime,” 
Bassett said. “I found myself coun­
seling and even pastoring these 
kids, trying to keep them out of 
jail instead of putting them in.” 
Looking for alternative ways 
to serve children, Bassett discov­
ered Yale’s Education Leadership 
and Ministry Program, founded by 
Father Jarvis. This certificate pro­
gram, which supplements Bassett’s 
MAR degree, prepares students 
to pursue vocations as chaplains, 
administrators, 
teachers, 
and 
coaches in independent schools. 
Bassett hopes to work in an inde­
pendent primary school so that 
he can help kids with education 
instead of punishing them in the 
justice system. 
He studies with a clear focus 
on where he is headed, a quality 
that seems to separate profits from 
many of the students who arrived 
at YDS right out of college. “When 
I was in law school, the people 
who had been out in the real world 
a couple years always treated their 
schooling more seriously, and I 
really envied them,” Bassett said. 
“And now I see exactly what that 
looks like.”
Many of the Former Profits 
are no strangers to the world of 
religion, even if a life of ministry 
may not have crossed their minds 
before. Cheryl Bundy, a fourth 
year part-time student pursuing a 
Masters of Arts in Religion, worked 
on Wall Street for twelve years and 
as a fundraiser in the non-profit 
world for another twelve. After 
September 11, she worked at St. 
James Episcopal Church in New 
York City doing education and 
outreach. In 2009, she moved 
to Connecticut with her fam­
ily and couldn’t find a job that 
interested her.
“I was forty-four, and I finally 
asked myself, ‘What do you really 
want to do? What makes your 
heart tick?’” she said.
Partly because of how much 
she loved her work at St. James, 
she decided to study theology 
at YDS.

Some 
students 
have 
spent their entire lives in service 
to their faith before joining the 
Profits. Carlos Insignares is cur­
rently in his second year of stud­
ies to earn a Masters in Divinity, 
a three-year degree that prepares 
him for ordination and minis­
try. He has served in the ministry 
since age twelve, as a liturgical 
committee member, catechist, and 
confirmation teacher. 
I asked Insignares why, despite 
having been so involved in minis­
try all his life, he had waited until 
the age of fifty to seek ordina­
tion. He responded that this was 
not his first time pursuing priest­
hood. In the fall of 1993, after
