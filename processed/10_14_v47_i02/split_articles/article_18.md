“W
ARNING: Travel at your own risk. Holy Land 
U.S.A. under construction.” A headless statue 
of Jesus watches over a path of broken asphalt. The 
path winds past the sign, through the entrance arches 
and around the hill, which is ringed by a low wall. 
People break off from the crowd. Even the girls in flats 
and skirts climb the wall and begin picking their way 
through the remains of a miniature Bethlehem. Under 
fallen trees, I catch of a glimpse of broken steps lead­
ing up through the rubble.

This Bethlehem is nestled in the hills of Waterbury, 
Conn. It marks the beginning of Jesus’ life, which 
Holy Land USA traces from birthplace to tomb. The 
park has been closed since 1984, but a restoration 
effort is now underway. There’s no set timeline for the 
park’s reopening, but board members expect it to take 
years. In September, Holy Land opened to visitors for 
one afternoon.

In the 1950s, John Greco, a local attorney, 
built Holy Land USA on eighteen acres of land 
near his hilltop home overlooking the city. 
“No matter how much money he had, he devoted 
every penny into Holy Land, and he lived like Mother 
Teresa did. Everything was for God,” says board mem­
ber Rebecca Greco Calabrese, Greco’s great-niece. 
“When you were with him, you felt holy...you felt it, 
coming out of his pores.”

The park’s buildings, constructed from old appli­
ances, chicken wire, and plaster, are just a few feet tall, 
placed in clusters to depict different Biblical events. 
Most have collapsed. Those that still stand are pale, 
with little arched doors and windows. They cover the 
hill, competing with the twisted pines, birches, cat­
tails, and thistles that have overrun the park. 
“It was beautiful for a while,” says a white-haired 
woman dressed in black as she waits for a shuttle to 
the Mass. “There was almost a reverence about the 
place.” In the park’s heyday, buses brought forty thou­
sand visitors a year from all over the U.S. and around 
the world.

When Greco died, the park was entrusted to 
a group of nuns, the Religious Teachers Filippini. 
The nuns eventually put the property up for sale in 
2013, and Mayor Neil O’Leary and local business­
man Fritz Blasius bought the property, planning to 
restore it. The restoration progresses in bursts, as its
 limited funding allows.

They set their milestones based on the liturgi­
cal calendar. First, they restored the cross in time for 
Christmas. Then they focused on clearing the over­
growth in time for the Feast of the Exaltation of the 
Holy Cross, which commemorates St. Helena’s discov­
ery of the cross on which Jesus was crucified. Chuck 
Pagano, president of Holy Land’s board of directors, 
tells me that in the days leading up to the my visit, 
over 7,500 trees were cut down. 

A friend and I still stumble uphill over shrubs 
and fallen branches until I reach Solomon’s tem­
ple, also in disrepair. A sign proclaims: “YOU HAVE 
MADE IT.” The temple is just a cement cylinder split 
in half to reveal a green interior. The cupola lies in 
the center of the wreckage, as though launched by a 
catapult. Next to it, other cubic parts of the structure
