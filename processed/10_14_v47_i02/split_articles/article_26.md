point he takes a tumbler from a 
table to his left and pours its con­
tents down Lefleur’s back. 

For all the finesse Boots exhib­
its in his demonstration, he is still 
a fairly new to the leather com­
munity; he won last year’s title 
only a few months after join­
ing the group. Like many other 
leathermen, he was introduced to 
the concept of leather and BDSM 
through pornography. “It was 
just a fantasy. I didn’t know there 
was such a thing as a titleholder. I 
thought it was just hot guys wear­
ing leather,” recalls Boots. But the 
summer before last, eight years 
after moving to New Haven, Boots 
asked one of his drag queen friends 
to introduce him to some leather­
men. That was how he found 
CT Cruisers.

During his tenure as Mr. CT 
Leather 2014, he has fundraised for 
AIDS Project New Haven and the 
Downtown Evening Soup Kitchen. 
He is also largely responsible for 
expanding the New-York-based 
Leather Cares Ribbons, a leather 
and HIV/AIDS awareness organi­
zation, into other Northeastern 
states. “The non-sexual part is 
helping the community and doing 
charitable work. The sexual part is 
embracing yourself and exploring 
your kinky side,” says Boots. 

At a morning session titled 
“Boys Will Be Boys,” eighteen 
leathermen gather in the con­
ference room of the Omni New 
Haven 
Hotel, 
hungover 
and 
bleary-eyed. The term “boy,” I 
learn, refers to leathermen who 
prefer taking the submissive role 
in BDSM relationships. Their coun­
terparts, “sirs” such as Boots and 
Jones, are the dominant figures. A 
number of boys told me over the 
weekend that their day jobs come 
with a lot of responsibility—some 
are tech administrators or execu­
tives at consulting firms—and 
they see giving up power in their 
personal relationships as a release 
from their professional lives. 

The 
moderator 
is 
David 
Bielski, the Sergeant at Arms for 
the Leather Boys of New England, 
another BDSM fraternal service 
organization. He starts off by 
explaining, “This is meant to be 
open book. If there’s anything any­
body wants to talk about, we’ll talk 
about it. There’s no real set plan or 
agenda.” He then chuckles, “which 
kind of might be saying I’m not 
too prepared.” 

We go around the room with 
the 
customary 
introductions. 
At my turn I tell them, “I’m a 
student reporter doing a story 
on this whole weekend. Thank 
you for having me.” Jones, to my 
left, interjects, “Well, we haven’t 
had you yet.” The room erupts 
in laughter. 

Leathermen trace their roots 
back to motorcycle gangs and the 
closeted soldiers returning from 
WWII in the 1940s. But the leather 
community, like any other, faces 
the challenge of maintaining its 
customs in an ever-shifting milieu, 
as the so-called New Guard strains 
against the customs of the Old 
Guard. In the early stages of leather 
culture, when being homosexual 
was a punishable offense by law, it 
was dangerous to be involved with 
gay BDSM. Since people risked 
both their professional and their 
social standing, leathermen had 
to proceed with caution. But now, 
in a more liberal society, today’s 
leathermen have realized that 
die-hard traditionalism is unsus­
tainable. They walk the fine line 
between preserving the traditions 
of their seventy-year history while 
also embracing modern trends.  

The sir-boy dynamic requires, 
arguably, more trust than other 
varieties of erotic relationships, 
because of the incredibly intimate 
power exchange that bondage-
related sex involves. Boys give up 
control to their sirs by submit­
ting to constraining and physically 
painful situations, so confidence 
in one’s partner is vital in manag­
ing the inherent risks of BDSM. In 
THIRTY YEARS 
AGO, BOYS 
KNEW THEIR 
PLACE AND 
SIRS KNEW 
THEIR PLACE.
