“O
pposition? Partner? Speaker?” Matt asks as he 
stands before the judge, taking stock of the 
room before he starts his speech. His partner is seated 
to his right, and his opponents, Zariah Altman and 
Xavier Sottile, are waiting on the left. He places his 
cell phone timer on the conference table. “All right, 
I’ll begin.”

The room is quiet.

“From Russia, to China, to Iran, to Syria, to ISIS, 
far too long the U.S. has been proven to be weak on 
the international stage.” 
His speech aims high, but its wording comes 
across as a bit clunky. 
“There are numerous actions that you could use to 
confront aggressively,” he continues, “including but 
not limited to resuming aerial surveillance flyovers, 
excluding China from the G20 summit, quotas on 
treasury buyback programs, and enforcing extradi­
tion and environmental treaties as written by the U.N.”

It’s a Saturday afternoon, and we are in a class­
room in Yale’s Kline Biology Tower. They’re compet­
ing in the parliamentary debate division at the Yale 
Invitational, an annual tournament hosted by the Yale 
Debate Association each September. Matt and Jack, two 
blond boys from a wealthy Long Island public school, 
are teamed up against Zariah and Xavier, seniors at 
New Haven public schools who are a part of the New 
Haven Urban Debate League (UDL).

UDL is a Yale organization that sends under­
graduates to New Haven public high schools to teach 
competitive debate. The league has been around for 
a decade, but in the last few years it has grown to 
encompass more than thirty-six Yale student coaches 
and a hundred New Haven students. UDL students 
compete against teams from around the state, and 
recently, have started to hold their own against teen­
agers from the affluent suburban districts who have 
traditionally dominated the debate scene.

The stakes are high—this is the fourth round, 
and Zariah and Xavier think that they won their first 
three matches. Opponents are assigned based on a 
win-loss record, and Zariah and Xavier are now up 
against debaters who are older and more experienced
