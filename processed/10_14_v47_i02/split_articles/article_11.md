paperwork was incomplete, meaning that the case 
would be hard to defend in court. Nearly a year later, 
no legal action has been taken. 

Residents of Westville Manor often end up tangled 
up in bureaucracy. In the 1950s, the city of New Haven 
owned, operated, and repaired all of its own low-
income property. Later, grossly underfunded, the city 
council began to distribute housing funds to private 
landlords through the Section 8 program rather than 
investigating new budget-balancing methods. This 
new jointly operated system has created a communi­
cation gap, not only between the public and private 
sectors, but between the management and the inhab­
itants. One tenant gestured at a huge stack of paper­
work on her kitchen table, telling me how little of it 
she understood.

And tenants feel that the management’s account­
ability has only worsened. Another Wayfarer Street 
resident, who asked to remain anonymous, described 
a severe cockroach infiltration on the ground floor 
of her house. “I’m not going to report it, because 
it’s never going to get fixed anyways,” she remarked. 
“The unit sends someone to come look; then I never 
hear back no matter how often I call.”  
I called Elm City Communities myself, and a rep­
resentative told me that some of residents’ problems 
were fixed. Debbie Hill confirmed that her ceiling has 
indeed been repaired. But when I asked further ques­
tions about the state of the complex, I was told to con­
tact another representative. When, after many tries, I 
got in touch with him, he told that I should stop call­
ing him and directed me back to the first. The Housing 
Authority’s limited staff seemed too overworked to 
comment further. 

Meanwhile, a more dangerous problem has 
remained unaddressed in the streets of Westville 
Manor: crime and gun violence. One tenant told a 
story of two residents robbing their next-door neigh­
bors. Mabry, whose 7-year-old cousin was shot within 
the complex in August, believes that residents from 
nearby Dixwell and Newhallville have often been the 
perpetrators of these crimes. Another tenant remarked 
that outsiders come to the neighborhood in swarms, 
bringing violence and chaos. In late May, four shoot­
ings were reported within a seven-day period, and 
New Haven police sirens wailed ceaselessly in 
Westville Manor. 

Violence can be a chronic problem in New Haven’s 
low-income neighborhoods, one that even outside 
organizations’ best efforts can’t solve. In 2000, Joanne 
Sciulli FES ’96, founded an organization called Solar 
Youth to offer children between nine and thirteen 
programs that focus on cooperation, tolerance, com­
munity service, and leadership. They began neighbor­
hood-based programs in Westville Manor in 200W8, 
with weekly activities ranging from bike rides to reviv­
ing the ecosystems of nearby ponds. But the staff saw 
the realities of Westville Manor crime firsthand when 
the Solar Youth house was burglarized several times 
in 2009. 

After this summer’s violence, Sciulli began to post 
banners around the neighborhood. One reads, “YOU 
ARE IMPORTANT TO US.” Another reads, “GUNS KILL, 
SO KEEP OFF.” 

One tenant further down Wayfarer Street said that 
Elm City Communities is unresponsive and unhelpful 
on issues of both crime and internal damage. “They 
send out a van daily to patrol the streets and help out, 
but a single employee can’t really do much,” said 
the resident. 

The tenants feel as though they have been pushed 
aside. A few told me they plan to leave the unit within 
the year, planning to move to more urban areas of 
the city, but most do not have the means to move 
elsewhere. For Mabry, though, it is a question of alle­
giance to the neighborhood where he has lived for 
twenty-eight years. “There’s a community here that 
nobody else ever gonna see but we who live in it 
because nobody bother to fix it,” he said. 

But for the sake of home, he will stay and wait 
for repairs to come. “I’m good with it here,” he 
said. “We’re a tight community. We take no bullshit 
from no one.”
