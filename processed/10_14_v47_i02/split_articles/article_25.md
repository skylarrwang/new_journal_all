unorthodox desires: “Ninety per­
cent of the time we’re vanilla. 
Vanilla’s fine, but during the other 
ten percent we add other things to 
it.” The leather community selects 
an ambassador partly to help 
dispel the stereotype of the sex-
obsessed BDSM practitioner. Mr. 
CT Leather is expected to highlight 
the leathermen’s philanthropic 
side by fundraising and bringing 
awareness to local charities.


Ramos appears uncomfortable 
that this party is my first glimpse 
into leather culture, which is 
understandable: The ambience is 
hypersexual. While there is noth­
ing particularly outlandish hap­
pening 
downstairs—just 
forty 
to fifty leathermen socializing 
around your garden-variety bar—
the long, narrow room on the sec­
ond floor is a shrine to BDSM. A 
human-sized birdcage stands next 
to a wooden pillory, a painting of 
a muscular, nude man in repose 
hangs in the center of the room, 
and a folding table towards the 
back holds various whips and pad­
dles. Chains hang from the ceiling, 
and the lights are dimmed.


My eyes keep wandering from 
Ramos to the opposite corner of 
the room, where a man stands fac­
ing the wall with his hands bound 
above his head. He is shirtless and 
his khaki shorts are pulled down 
to his ankles, revealing grey boxer 
briefs. Behind him stands Rick 
Jones, a portly man in his mid-
fifties with a milk-white Mohawk 
and boxed beard, who flogs his 
bare upper back with a cat-o’-
nine-tails whip. Jones—whose 
name has been changed to protect 
his privacy—augments the stan­
dard attire of a black leather vest 
and matching boots with a pair of 
camouflage shorts, giving him the 
look of a punk-rock Santa Claus. 
His disposition is nonchalant; he 
moves the whip haphazardly up 
and down and side to side in the 
same way that he might paint 
his house. Leathermen in various 
states of undress watch and chat.


Jones is the co-founder of CT 
Cruisers, a fraternal organization 
of leathermen. The CT Cruisers are 
helping Mr. CT Leather Inc. hold 
the competition this year, though 
they are known mostly for the “bar 
night” they hold each month. At 
the parties, which are open to the 
public, they put on BDSM dem­
onstrations like the one Jones is 
conducting now to introduce the 
uninitiated to leather culture. “The 
motivation [behind the demon­
strations] is to give men who are 
interested in BDSM a place where 
they can learn in a safe and com­
fortable environment,” Jones says.


At the other end of the room, 
a slender drag queen, also shirtless, 
puts her hands through the pillory. 
This is Harlette Lefleur, the High 
Empress of the Imperial Sovereign 
Court of Connecticut, a charitable 
Hartford-based drag queen group. 
Omar Boots, a muscular man in 
his twenties with an impressive 
mustache, walks up behind Lefleur 
and gently places his leather-clad 
hand on the small of her back. He 
then picks up a paddle and begins 
striking the area around Lefleur’s 
shoulder blades.


Boots won the Mr. CT Leather 
competition last year. His leather 
outfit is more elaborate than the 
others: skin-tight trousers, boots, 
gloves, and a short-sleeve jacket 
that buttons down the front. 
He wears a sash that reads “Mr. 
Connecticut Leather, 2014.” This 
ensemble is called “formal wear,” 
in leather parlance. Compared to 
Jones’s, Boots’s technique seems 
much more intimate. His move­
ments are slow and deliberate, and 
he pauses now and then to kiss 
the nape of Lefleur’s neck. At one
