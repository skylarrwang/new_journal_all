Performance Index,” a system that 
assigns grades based on a school’s 
standardized test scores, to help 
the public understand the available 
data. Of the 944 schools it graded 
across the state, sixty-three failed, 
including ten in New Haven. 
ConnCAN says the reports are 
as a way to commend “schools 
that are providing students with 
a high-quality education regard­
less of race, wealth, or ZIP code.” 
But, as a result, other schools’ 
shortcomings, as measured by test 
scores, are on display. Color-coded 
and printed in large, foreboding 
letters, the report cards make it 
easy to distinguish failing schools 
(marked in red with large Fs next 
to their names), from passing 
ones. And, for each of the three 
years ConnCAN has issued the SPI 
reports, Wilbur Cross has failed. 
But a debate continues: Is this no-
excuses approach the way to get a 
school to turn around?


For Chris Willems, who taught 
at Wilbur Cross from 2005 to 2012, 
criticism of the school is nothing 
new. “When they first started a 
failing school labeling system they 
labeled us ‘dropout factories,’” said 
Willems, referring to a controver­
sial 2007 study by Johns Hopkins 
University. “Yeah, there are a lot of 
challenged children in our school. 
Yeah, there’s a lot of stress. Yeah, 
they’ve had traumatic lives…but, a 
‘dropout factory?’”


The school has seen recent 
improvements. The four-year grad­
uation rate rose to over seventy 
percent in 2012 with the assis­
tance of multi-million dollar state 
grants. But ConnCAN’s improve­
ment grade for the school, which 
measures change in test scores 
from year to year, is a B. Still, the 
B lies at the bottom of a list of Fs 
for student performance in math, 
reading, and science.


Even the district’s highest-
level administrators take issue 
with the system. “Unfortunately, 
the ConnCAN report falls vic­
tim to oversimplification in the 
assignment of grades in ways 
that I think assign blame to edu­
cators and school communities 
that is counterproductive to its 
goal,” New Haven superintendent 
Garth Harries said. 


ConnCAN 
CEO 
Jennifer 
Alexander maintained that the 
report cards’ bold design is meant 
to satisfy the public’s “hunger for 
clear and user-friendly informa­
tion” and to help influence pub­
lic policy. And from a publicity 
perspective, the report cards have 
achieved this goal. According to 
Alexander, they have generated 
a lot of Internet traffic and have 
appeared frequently in local media. 


Borrowing principles from 
the business world, Alexander 
and other reformers believe that 
schools—and 
society—can 
be 
transformed if only we administer 
the right tests, collect the right data, 
and motivate struggling schools to 
move in the right direction. She 
claims that ConnCAN’s list of “suc­
cess story schools”—schools that 
serve kids from underprivileged 
backgrounds but achieve high test 
scores—helps prove that transfor­
mation is possible. “Kids can suc­
ceed at the right level regardless of 
their background if they’re given 
the right opportunities, instruc­
tion, quality of teaching, and sup­
port.” Alexander said. “Our goal 
and job is to prove this.”


“Accountability” is the buzz­
word of the day in education 
policy, and ConnCAN’s reports are 
a symptom of a system that has 
embraced a punitive approach: 
schools can be fixed if they are 
held “accountable” for their short­
comings. Under the No Child 
Left Behind Act of 2001, states 
receive federal funding in order 
to administer standardized tests 
to all public school students. Title 
I Schools like Wilbur Cross, which 
receive additional funding for 
students from low-income fami­
lies, are required to demonstrate 
“Adequate Yearly Progress.” Since 
Connecticut obtained a waiver 
from the Obama administration in 
2012, it has continued to receive 
funding while escaping some of 
NCLB’s strictest and least realistic 
expectations, such as the require­
ment that 100 percent of students 
demonstrate proficiency in reading 
and math by 2015. But in order to 
obtain the waiver, Connecticut 
had to present new methods for 
holding schools accountable. 


Willems, echoing a national 
chorus of educators, believes the 
emphasis on test scores has forced 
teachers and schools to change 
their focus. Labels like the one 
ConnCAN applied to Wilbur Cross 
“encourage a narrowing of the 
curriculum that prevents us from 
creating considerate, intellectu­
ally stimulating environments for 
children at the high school level,” 
Willems said. “We’ve lost arts, 
physical education, music—joy.”  


All three teachers I contacted 
characterize ConnCAN’s rankings 
as outdated and unproductive, but 
their response is not only about 
their own grades; it’s about what 
it means for their students, as well. 
“My instinct is that I really want to 
defend our school against what I 
think is an unfair rating system 
that unfortunately gets too much 
press,” one teacher, who asked to 
remain anonymous, told me.


The numbers also fail to take 
into account the realities of stu­
dents’ lives, and what Willems 
called “the critical thinking skills 
my children need to employ to do 
the incredible things they do”—
while they are “raising children 
on their own, coming to school, 
and working.”


Willems and his fellow teach­
ers are not the only ones who real­
ize the system is broken. Though 
Alexander stands by ConnCAN and 
the report card system, she admit­
ted that she hoped the Connecticut 
public school system would soon 
find a more comprehensive way 
to use testing data. “We know that 
children, if given the opportunity 
to meet high expectations, will 
get there,” she explained. “But 
we know…that they are starting 
from different places. We need to 
develop an accountability system 
that acknowledges those different 
starting places.”  


The editors’ note in the June 
2014 edition of the Proclamation 
reads, “The future of our school 
is not in any person’s hands. Every 
student, 
teacher, 
administrator, 
and staff member can choose to 
move forward. Or we can stagnate.” 
But despite the optimism of its 
students and the determination of 
its faculty, Wilbur Cross will con­
tinue to bear the “failing” label, 
even if it is the grading system 
itself that has failed.
