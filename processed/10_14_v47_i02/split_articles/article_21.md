than their previous opponents. If they win this round, 
they’ll compete in the final rounds tomorrow.
Today’s resolution: “This House would aggres­
sively confront China.” In the world of debate, “reso­
lutions” are the polemical but vaguely worded state­
ments that students argue for or against. The team 
speaking in favor defines the terms, so the “House” 
could be the U.S. House of Representatives—or, if 
the team gets goofy, it could be defined as the ruling 
dynasty of Mars. These kids, however, are taking it all 
very seriously.

As Matt speaks, his teammate looks down at his 
notes, which he keeps in a leather portfolio. Zariah 
and Xavier bend their heads over their legal pads, 
outlining their opponents’ speeches next to their 
own hastily scribbled arguments. The sheer vol­
ume of information these two boys know—the 
intricacies of international politics, the minutiae of 
U.S. foreign policy—doesn’t intimidate Zariah or 
Xavier. In just a few minutes, they’ll have a chance to 
knock it all down. 

Unlike the other urban debate leagues that began 
to pop up across the country in the 1990s, UDL is 
unaffiliated with the National Association of Urban 
Debate Leagues. Run by a team of volunteer Yale stu­
dents, it operates without the endowment and per­
manent staff that the national association requires for 
membership. Instead, Yale’s UDL relies on students’ 
time and resources from Dwight Hall, the umbrella 
organization for Yale’s social justice groups.

Aaron Zelinsky ’06 LAW ’10, founder of New 
Haven’s UDL, got the idea from his great-uncle 
Seymour Simon, a justice of the Illinois Supreme 
Court in the 1980s who worked on Chicago’s UDL 
program. Simon told Zelinsky about the program at a 
family bar mitzvah, and Zelinsky pitched the idea to 
Reggie Mayo, who was then the superintendent of the 
New Haven public schools, in 2004. 

The program had trouble getting organized, but 
it has grown steadily since then. “We got no money 
from the schools,” Zelinsky says. “The way I sold it 
was: This is zero cost. That was the only reason we 
were able to do it.” Only six high school students 
showed up to the first tournaments, so two Yale stu­
dents had to step in and debate to even out the num­
bers. As late as 2011, when Becca Steinberg ’15, the 
current president of UDL, began coaching students, 
the league had to occasionally cancel tournaments 
because not enough kids had signed up. 

Last semester, UDL expanded into three new 
schools, and this semester, into two more. Twelve 
New Haven public schools are now part of the league, 
and tournaments haven’t been cancelled for lack of 
debaters in at least a year. More than that, UDL kids 
have done well in the last few years at state and 
national tournaments. At the 2014 Osterweis Debate 
Tournament, a free event for Connecticut high school 
students financed by Yale’s Jonathan Edwards College, 
the top two teams were from UDL. In both 2013 and 
2014, the top-ranking junior in the tournament was a 
UDL debater. The most recent was Zariah.

The demographics of the UDL students are very 
different from those of the largely white, affluent 
students who won—or even participated in—these 
competitions prior to the founding of the New Haven 
league. At some UDL schools, such as Wilbur Cross, 
over eighty percent of the students qualify for free 
or reduced-price lunches, and even at schools with 
slightly more middle-class students, such as the 
Sound School, nearly half qualifies. At all but one of 
the twelve schools in which UDL debates, minority 
students outnumber white students. 

John Buell, a civics teacher at the Sound School 
who is the faculty advisor for the UDL team, says the 
kids on the debate team tend to be more academically 
inclined in the first place. UDL has had champion 
debaters ranging from the children of Yale professors 
to kids who are undocumented immigrants, but after 
six hours at school, they all have to sit down and lis­
ten, think hard, and argue. UDL offers students a safe 
space to work through these intellectual challenges 
together. “That feeling of insecurity that a lot of these 
kids can have when they’re suddenly facing wealthy 
white Connecticut out there in a broader venue—they 
don’t get that, they’re sort of just amongst themselves,” 
Buell says. “And the judge is being incredibly sup­
portive in the critiques that they’re giving.”

The idea is not only to train them to debate bet­
ter, but also to learn to communicate effectively out­
side the world of debate. Something that Zelinsky says 
sticks with me: “Not every kid that comes out of the 
UDL is going to be going to Yale College. And not 
everyone has to be…if it helps a kid walk into a job 
interview and be able to present cogent arguments, 
then he’s learned something useful. If it helps some­
one feel a little more confident when they’re speaking,

that’s useful. [Maybe] you can help some kids who 
wouldn’t otherwise go to college, or wouldn’t oth­
erwise get a job if they’re not going to go to college.” 

In Zelinsky’s terms, “This is giving people a 
voice. That’s what you’re doing, you’re giving people 
a voice.”

Zariah grew up in Stratford with her mother and 
grandmother. Her father left when she was 2, and she 
only occasionally visited the Native American reserva­
tion where her father’s family was from. She moved 
to New Haven in elementary school, and she started 
competing in UDL when she entered the Sound 
School as a freshman in 2011. In mid-September, 
she along with three other teammates, have come to 
Dwight Hall for their weekly practice. They’re work­
ing with Steinberg to prepare for the upcoming Yale 
Invitational tournament. 

 “Have you guys heard of soft power versus hard 
power?” Steinberg says.

 “Yes,” Zariah immediately jumps in. “In 
California, I did.”

Zariah won a half-tuition scholarship to a debate 
camp at Stanford University last summer because 
she was the highest-ranking junior at the Osterweis 
Debate Tournament. She tells me that she didn’t find 
out till a few weeks ago that her scholarship was only 
half-tuition: Without telling her, Steinberg held a 
bake sale to come up with the other half. 

She is now waiting to hear whether she will have 
the chance to attend an elite university, like Stanford, 
as an undergraduate. In September, she submitted her 
applications to the Questbridge program, which aims 
to connect underprivileged, high-achieving high 
school students with top-ranked schools.

Two of the other debaters, Dhaval and Vishal, have 
to go home early, so Steinberg has Zariah and Xavier 
debate alone against one another. This kind of debate is 
called “Ironman.” After the details are settled and the 
kids have time to prepare their arguments, Steinberg 
gets her cell phone out to time the speeches. 

Before they begin, she says, strict but smiling, 
“Now, Zariah, you’re going to talk slowly and loudly, 
right?” She turns to me and explains. “Ever since 
Zariah got back from California she’s been talking 
incredibly fast, which is how they debate there.” 

When Zariah begins to speak, I understand 
Steinberg’s concern. Zariah is authoritative and 
unapologetic, and she argues very, very fast. She 
brings indignation to whatever argument she takes up. 
When she finishes a claim, she says “right,” not as if 
it’s a question, but as if it’s an affirmation. She holds 
out her arm, palm outward, for the audience’s (or 
the judge’s) recognition, or raises her palm outward, 
like “stop,” to ask them to join in her rejection of the 
opponent’s argument. She looks the judge in the eye.

I’m at the Sound School one afternoon in October, 
waiting for UDL practice to begin. The kids have trick­
led in from their classes, chatting and joking with 
one another. “I love you, Giovanni,” one girl repeat­
edly calls to her schoolmate. “Love you too, girl,” 
he says back.

The resolution for the day’s trial debate is espe­
cially hard. Once the teams have paired up, Steinberg 
writes the resolution on the board: “THBT American

search engine companies should not do business in 
countries that censor the web.”

“What’s THBT?” a skinny blond kid asks.

“This house believes that,” explains Zariah.

At another table, Steinberg is fielding other 
questions about the resolution, which the kids 
don’t quite understand. 

“Like, you can’t go on Facebook in China,” 
Steinberg explains.

“On Facebook?” the girl responds, shocked. “What!”

Meanwhile, Zariah is trying to get her team’s 
arguments ready. Google is a massive American com­
pany, she says, and it would be hypocritical for the 
American government to promote free speech while 
allowing American companies to cooperate with 
censorship laws.

“Does that make sense?” she asks them.

“Yes…” her teammate says hesitantly, playing with 
his pencil.

“Are you just saying that?” she laughs and explains 
it again. It isn’t at all condescending: She’s older, and 
has been debating for a long time. The younger stu­
dents listen to her.

Most practices go like this. The coaches also have 
monthly curricula, which attempt to fill in the gaps, 
teaching students history, philosophy, and civics that 
their schools haven’t covered. I even learned a new 
phrase at a practice I attended: “Stare decisis,” to stand 
by decisions, usually those by previous courts. 

On the way back from practice, Steinberg tells me 
that when Zariah first started debating three years ago, 
the Sound School team had only two students. The 
coastal school’s popular rowing team still monopo­
lizes many students’ after-school hours, but the debate 
team has grown steadily each year.

I ask what Zariah was like back then, when the 
only other debater was Jake Colavolpe, who is now 
a freshman at Yale. “She was so bad,” Steinberg 
laughs, sheepish. “The first time I saw the two of 
them debate, the topic was, should the New Haven 
Green have a Christmas tree? And their speeches were, 
like, forty-five seconds long.” Not filling the allotted 
time is a sign of a rookie debater, she explains.

How did Zariah get so good? I wonder. Steinberg 
tells me that once they got a little better, Zariah 
and Colavolpe would debate against Yalies. The high 
schoolers would often lose, but they wouldn’t give 
up: “Every time that happened, they worked five 
times harder,” Steinberg says.

I think of the sheer number of hours Steinberg 
has spent with the students she coaches. I meet 
Colavope on a bench in the center of Yale’s campus 
to talk. “Undoubtedly, a very big reason why I’m 
sitting here on this bench is because of them,” says 
Colavolpe, referring to Steinberg and her fellow 
coaches. Steinberg tutored him for the SATs, read 
his college essays, and baked and sold cupcakes to 
raise money for his trip to a debate camp at Stanford, 
the same one Zariah attended the following year. 
“Throughout high school they were just a phone call 
or a text away if I needed them.” It’s no wonder Zariah 
sounds like a younger version of Steinberg when she 
addresses her teammates. 

At the Yale Invitational, the tournament the kids 
had been practicing for, nearly a thousand kids in 
ill-fitting suits are looking for coffee and breakfast. 
Parents are trying to find where tours of the campus 
start. Inside the Sloane Physics Lab, parents take awk­
ward iPhone photos of the kids clustered in the audi­
torium. No New Haven public school student was 
on the roster until 2012, as far as Steinberg knows. 
This year, there are four. 

It’s easy to pick Zariah out of the crowd—she’s 
the only black student competing in parliamentary 
debate. When Steinberg asks Zariah where her suit 
jacket is, she says, “It seemed really big. I’ll wear it 
tomorrow.” Her hair is straightened, kept short 
above her shoulders, and hoop earrings dangle from 
her ears. She’s talking to her debate partner, Xavier, 
a pale kid in a navy suit jacket with bright, fake-brass 
buttons. His black dress shoes remain untied all day. 
Steinberg tells me that New Haven UDL tour­
naments, kept within the New Haven league, are 
normally held on Friday afternoons so that they 
don’t interfere with students’ part-time jobs. Today, 
on a Saturday, some cannot make it to the competition 
because of work. Still, urban teams from Detroit and 
New York City join the four UDL debaters present.

The tournament is late to start, so the kids chat 
for a while. When they start talking about Yale, Vishal 
says, “The funniest thing I’ve heard Yalies say has to 
be—this one Yalie on the Green says to the other, in 
the middle of the Green, ‘Are we in the ghetto yet?’” 
Zariah and Xavier also run into a team from 
UDL’s multi-day summer program, run by Yale stu­
dents, which draws students from across the state.
