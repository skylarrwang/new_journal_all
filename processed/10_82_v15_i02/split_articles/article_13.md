Financial aid: 
The diversity Issue 
Will the Reagan administration's per-
sistent cutbacks in educational aid af-
fect the diversity of Yale and other Ivy 
League schools? Many people, in-
cluding Yale President A. Bartlett 
Giamatti, fear the reductions will 
threaten to halt or reverse the trend in 
the last two decades toward greater 
enrollment of minority and public 
school students in private universities. 

These fears come at a time when 
private schools, the Ivies in particular, 
have been receiving a great deal of bad 
press. The New York Times, for exam-
ple, recently decried what it termed "a 
new college segregation," citing "a 
disturbing decline in the number of 
low- and moderate-income students at 
private colleges." The Times wrote: 
"The nation is unwittingly moving 
toward a caste system, with private in-
stitutions serving the wealthy and only 
a token number of the poor." 

A recent cover of The New Republic 
("Schools for Snobbery: 
You Are 
Where You 
Went," 
October 4) 
featured a less-than-reverent cartoon 
depicting a Yale family portrait, with 
grandad, dad, and grandson proudly 
posed in Old Blue attire with Yale but-
tons in a sitting room covered with 
Yale wallp~r and a Lux tt Veritas 
plaque. The article, written· by Paul 
FusselJ, began: "In the absence of a 
system of hereditary 
ranks and 
titles ... Americans have had to de-
pend for their mechanism of snobbery 
far more than other peoples on their 
college and university 
hierarchy~ 
Accusing schools like Yale and Har-
vard of elitism, the article continued: 
.. 'The educational system has been ef-
fectively appropriated by the upper 
strata and transformed into an instru-
ment which tends to reproduce the 
class struture and transmit inequality' 
. . . The effect of the whole system is to 
stabilize class rigidity under the cover 
of opening up genuine higher learning 
to everyone." 

Indeed, a number of private schools, 
including Dartmouth and Brown, have 
had to abandon either the policy of 
"need-blind" admissions or of 
guaranteed aid to those who demon-
strate need. 

But 
Yale, 
Harvard, 
Princeton and other schools with 
substantial alumni resources and hefty 
endowments have so far been able to

maintain a policy of admittingstudents 
regardless of financial circumstances . 

Surprisingly, despite a near-record 
II ,023 applicants to Yale this fall, the 
number of students applying for fman-
cial aid declined for the first time in 
years. After three years of steep in-
creases, the percentage of freshmen on 
financial aid leveled ofT at 42 percent 
for the current freshman class, after 
being 43 percent for last year's class. 

Although 
fewer 
freshmen 
than 
sophomores are on fmancial aid this 
year, Worth David, dean of under-
graduate admissions, does not believe 
Yale is beginning to feel the effects of 
any "new colJege segregation" of rich 
and poor. 

In terms of minority and 
publicschool students enrolJed, David 
argues, the class of 1986 is more 
diverse than most classes over the past 
ten years. He includes the senior class, 
but not the sophomore class, in that 
judgment. 

Yale spends a lot of money in its e,. 
fort to attract what Giamatti one 
called "a splendidly inrcresting student 
body which reflects the -tuality and 
diversity of American society." In 
1981-82 aid for undergraduates and 
graduate students amounted to a stag-
gering ten percent of the University's 
total expenditures from endowments 
and general appropriations. Two years 
ago Yale spent $5.2 milJion to meet the 
needs of its undergraduate'!; last year it 
spent almost $7 million. 
~is year the 
cost of diversity and equ< 
1pponunity 
for undergraduates is pr 
·ted at $8.8 
million. 


Despite 
these steep increases, 
Giamatti and other administrators say 
the University is determined to con-
tinue its policy of admitting students 
regardless of need. Administrators, 
however, do not rule out the possibility 
of one day abandoning Yale's policy of 
meeting the full needs of admitted 
students. 

"Under such a policy (change)," said 
David, "if we admitted 600 students 
who qualified for aid but only had 
enough money to finance 500 of them, 
we might send letters of acceptance to 
all 600 but inform 100 of them that we 
couldn't meet their financial needs." 

Regardless of what happens to 
future admissions policies, adminis-
trators assure students currently 
enrolled that their needs will be met for 
the duration of their undergraduate 
careers. So with the exception of those 
who feel that Yale's student body has 
never been "splendidly interesting," 
students can expect Yale's diversity to 
remain intact for at least the next 
eleven months.
