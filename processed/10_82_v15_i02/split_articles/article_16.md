and political thought. As he had in 
literature, Pound assumed a mission in 
economics. He wrote books- among 
them, An ABC of &onomics andjiflmon 
and/or Musso/ini- and numerous arÂ· 
tides and treatises. He wrote to promi-
nent government officials and finan-
ciers, and he raved to his friends. To 
Eliot he wrote: 
Dear Possum 
SHIT for the church of England and the 
archbastid of Canterbugger. 
No use my 
telling him he is 
a 
pimp ... England as accuser; plantif and

During World War II he conducted 
a program over Rome Radio, broad-
cast in English, in which he discussed 
his economic and literary theory. 
Pound's economic thought centered on 
the seeming cross-purposes of men 
dealing in goods and men dealing in 
gold and silver money. In a broadcast 
over Rome Radio, he stated his case: 
"The New Deal policy, whether in-
tended or not, has been to the advan-
tage of men who had and have gold to 
sell, who have silver to sell, not to the 
advantage of mankind ... The 
Sassons own silver; the Rothschilds are 
gold brokers profiting by every deal 
that the Bank of London, the enemy of 
God and man, makes in gold, to buy 
or sell . . . There is not the least 
reason for the producers of grain and 
cotton to pay tribut~ to the producers 
or dealers in metals."
