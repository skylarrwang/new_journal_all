Architecture 
The ills of A&A

Paul Rudolph's Art and Architecture building has been the center of 
controversy since it was built 20 years ago. 
"Everything that everyone says about 
the building is right. It's illogical, sordid, cantankerous and irritating, but 
in a way it's touching, moving and sad. 
It must have some power or people 
wouldn't have focused their attention 
on it so. It's awful and awesome," said 
art history professor Vincent Scully, 
speaking about what he once called 
"the tragic drama" of the Art and Architecture building. 

Throughout its 20-year history the 
building, located on the corner of York 
and Chapel streets, has been the center 
of controversy. It has been called 
everything from 
"a 
funhouse 
for 
visitors, but not a place for serious artists 
to work," to "a threatening, non-
functional nightmare." It has been 
criticized for its inadequate studio 
space, heating and ventilation problems and wretched lighting conditions. 
A fire destroyed parts of it, forcing 
drastic changes, and at one time trouble 
with asbestos ceilings forced the 
building to close down altogether. 
The structure, which is supposed to 
house the majority of facilities for both 
the art and architecture schools, has 
not provided sufficient space for them, 
causing further complaints. "Basically, 
it doesn't serve our needs," said Robert 
Reed, director of undergraduate 
studies for the art school. "The spaces 
we're working with are really inadequate, both in quality and square 
footage." One consequence is that the 
art department has to restrict enrollment in classes. "There is a direct relation 
between the amount of space 
available and what we can accommodate 
in terms of students," said Reed. 
In its early history the building's 
purpose was supposedly "to restore the 
various disciplines [it houses] to a 
measure of unity." But classes for the 
art school now are held in 215 Park 
Street, 53 Wall Street, and Hammond 
Hall on Mansfield Street, while studio 
space is spread out all over campus. 
"Ideally, all of the art school's activity 
should be housed in this building, in 
accord with its original plan, which 
was a noble idea," said Reed.
