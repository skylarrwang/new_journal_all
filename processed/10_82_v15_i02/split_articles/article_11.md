Student government: critique and refonn 
Morris Pan ner 
Five times last month, I sat outside the 
dining hall asking the same questions 
over and over: "Have you voted for 
Yale College Council (YCC) yet? 
Have you bought a SAC card yet?" 
Although I didn't like being constantly 
ignored, I fully expected to be. We are 
so accustomed, it seems, to ignoring 
the student groups that shape our lives 
that we have stopped asking ourselves 
why we don't care. Few of us find it 
unusual that five colleges could not 
complete their YCC elections on the 
designated weekend in September. 
There were so many editorials critical 
of the YCC last sring in the Yale Daily 
News that we didn't bother to read 
them. And, if we have been less critical 
of the Joint Council of Social 
Chairpersons UCSC), it may be 
because few of us realize that JCSC 
takes $3.25 of our $30 SAC fee, and 
even fewer of us take part in deciding 
how the JCSC spends this money, 
which amounts to almost $10,000. 
It is useless to tell people to get in-
volved in student government if that 
government has no power and no 
money, 
while social committee 
chairpersons spend $10,000 with no 
one realizing it. I don't have a simple 
solution. I propose a new beginning 
for student government. First, com-
bine the JCSC and the YCC into one 
centralized and representative body. 
Then, do what Stiles and Berkley 
already do: allow the residential college 
councils to distribute the college's share 
of the money obtained from SAC card 
sales. 
The YCC and the JCSC have failed 
in the past because they operate under 
the assumption that issues of social life 
and student government are unrelated. 
The YCC talks to the administration, 
and the JCSC organizes the parties. 
The YCC has helped but not gov-
erned. Its efforts for Communiversity 
D ay, freshman orientation and a stu-
dent handbook have been successful, 
but this is just part of what it should 
do. The YCC discussed both the 
foreign language requirement and the 
addition of pluses and minuses to the 
grading system, but did nothing. The 
YCC will have no influence until it has 
a solid base of student support, which 
means a truly representative system. 
The YCC's impotence at first doesn't 
seem that serious. None of us is 
bothered that much by the recent 
changes. If we are going to take time 
off from school work, we would rather 
devote it to what we call "real" issues. 
But what if the changes in University 
policy- the grade change, the reduc-
tion m college seminars, the policy of 
shutting down happy hours and the 
most recent proposal to move finals'til 
after Christmas vacation- are part of a 
larger pattern? What if alJ the changes 
we see around us are not really pro-
gress, as the University claims, but 
simply a return to what we had before? 
Once we stop being involved in the 
decision-making 
process 
merely 
because everything seems so good, we 
are in danger of being unable to 
perceive the larger trends in policy. 
When we say that nothing is really im-
portant here, we only trivialize our 
lives here. 


In decisions of social life, too, we 
have too often let others decide for us. 
Although the JCSC sets the social 
calendar, 
it has 
not 
successfully 
represented student opinion to the 
masters and the administration. Last 
year when the Council of Masters 
changed the .SAC card purchasing 
rules, the JCSC made a poor attempt 
to find out what the students thought. 
As a result of the change, SACs could 
lose up to 30 percent of their budget to 
reduced SAC card sales. Why can the 
masters make such a significant change 
in our social lives without consulting 
us? 
But the problem of YCC and JCSC 
is more than just a lack of coordina-
tion. Neither group is representative. 
Each college elects only rwo YCC 
representatives and, despite their best 
efforts, they are rarely able to gain the 
students' confidence. My own exper-
ience as a representative has confirmed 
this, and many of the other represen-
tatives have expressed similar doubts 
to me. As one put it, "If I were to say 
that I speak for the students in my col-
lege, they wou!d laugh in my face." 
TheJCSC's problem is more subtle. 
Potentially, the college SACs could 
discuss JCSC issues at open SAC 
meetings, but somehow this. rarely 
happens. None of us ever sees the 
JCSC's budget, and even if we do have 
a suggestion, all we can do as ask our 
SAC chairpersons to present it and 
hope for the best. Too often SAC


chairpersons make all the decisions 
about the JCSC budget with little stu-
dent consultation. The JCSC needs to 
formalize the commumication betweeq 
itself and the students, because now it 
rarely happens. As a 
result, few 
students feel that they have any say in 
how the JCSC spends its money. 
The system I propose could correct 
these problems of apathy and represen-
tation, making student government a 
productive force on campus. Each col-
lege would elect 12 representatives to 
its own Residential College Council. It 
would be responsible for distributing 
the college's SAC funds to activities in 
the college, whether social committees 
dramats, publications or gamerooms 
The Residential College Council 
would, in turn, elect a chairperson and 
a vice-chairperson who would repre-
sent the college on the Student Senate. 
The Student Senate and the Residen-
tial College Councils would meet 
regularly. 
This new government would be not 
merely a reshuffiing of the present 
system, but a truly new government. 
Student government would be no 
longer a joke, but a responsibility. 
Since the new system would be 
representative and directly involve 
more people, the very process of 
establishing the councils would en-
courage commitment. Students would 
no longer be isolated from social and 
academic policy decisions, and the 
frustrations that so many of us have 
felt would end. The new government 
would have a substantial budget, in-
corporating both the JCSC and the 
YCC budgets, which together would 
amount to almost $12,000. We could 
try new ideas because we would have 
the money to pay for them. 
For colleges that don't have a college 
council system like those of Stiles or 
Berkeley, where the council distributes 
all SAC funds, the new system would 
require substantial changes. Despite 
these changes, however, each college 
would retain full control over its own 
SAC funds. 
The Student Senate, growing out of 
the Residential College Councils, 
would be responsible for the present 
roles of both the YCC and the JCSC. 
Mter discussing issues and social 
events in the Student Senate, the chair-
persons could then bring back the ideas 
to their colleges for discussion and ac-
tion. Less frequently, all 12 college 
councils would meet together to give 
final approval for any unified student 
action. 
Because the authority of student 
government is at present virtually non-
existent, I find that it is difficult to 
identify who should present the plan to 
the colleges. But it seems logical that 
the YCC representatives and the SAC 
chairpersons would introduce the plan 
and begin discussion. After allowing 
ample time for this discussion, the 
representatives and the chairpersons 
would conduct a referendum in each 
college, and if two-thirds of the colleges 
accept the plan, then it would be the 
new form of student government. 
In addition to discussing the change 
in government, students could also 
consider the possibility of making SAC 
fees mandatory, since the new system 
would give students more say in how 
the funds are spent. 
This new system would finally make 
student government worthwhile. We 
would have control over how student 
government spends 1ts money, and 
the Student Senate could present a 
position that truly represented the 
students. Once we had a student gov-
ernment that did something, the ad-
ministration would take it seriously, 
not merely as a service organization, 
but as a true student government. We 
must stop being complacent and exam-
ine our lives here critically, realizing 
that changes in policy are not random 
events but part of a larger educational 
philosophy. We will always be busy, 
but we must realize that building and 
improving a community is worth our 
time. Just because the issues facing us 
are not a matter of life and death that 
doesn't mean we should stop caring 
about how they are made.
