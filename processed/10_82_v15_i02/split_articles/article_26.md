key rehearsal space at 305 Crown 
Street to the Yale Rep. Gitelman ex-
plains the situation: "It was meant to 
be a huge complex of undergraduate 
activities. Dean [David] Henson put 
himself on the l~ne, telling u~ that this 
was the space for us, and trymg to g_et 
us interested in it. All this time the Rep 
had space at 205 Crown and they were 
paying a huge amount for it. Over the 
summer something snapped and 
somehow they handed the space to the 
Rep." 


When faced with the problem of fin-
Â·ding large spaces, dramats often turn 
to dining halls. But to most per-
formers, 
producers, 
directors and 
technicians, dining halls rank low on 
their list of favorite working spaces. 
"YMT was originally formed to per-
form musicals NOT in dining halls, 
Loud said. "You spend three-fourths of 
your energy moving tables. It's always 
a mess." This term, both of YMT's fall 
musicals, Fiorello and A Funny Thing 
Happened on the Way to the Forum (co-
sponsored by Ezra Stiles Dramat) will 
be performed in dining halls. 


Recently, 
some dining hall 
managers have been cracking down on 
student shows, limiting the number of 
productions or outright denying the 
use of dining hall space. Calhoun will 
now permit only one dining hall show 
per semester, while Davenport will no 
longer allow any dining hall shows. 


This crack-down was apparent at the 
end of last term when the commence-
ment show, Mem"/y We Roll Along, was 
refused dining hall space. The produc-
tion crew was forced to build an entire 
stage from scratch in 101 Linsley-Chit. 
"They just died," Loud recalled. "I 
think it took them three days to strike 
the thing. They absolutely killed 
themselves." 


The new Dramat Council has sent a 
letter to President A. Bartlett Giamat-
ti and is now in the process of putting 
together a more formal petition . 


Much of YMTs impetus to par-
ticipate in the administration of the 
new Dramat Council seems to stem 
from its own frustrations with the lack 
of space. As Loud said, "You can't do 
Fiorello in a squash court."
