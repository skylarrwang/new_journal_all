They are not ordinary criminals. These 
people are cyberphrenetic. They prefer 
computer company to human, and they 
can do awesome things with the 
machine. But · every once in a while one 
of them gets a little cocky, breaks the 
computer's security system and plays 
with things he shouldn't. 

On September 13 one of them broke 
into the computer, wreaked havoc with 
the system and almost cost the com-
puter science majors their machine. 
Jeff H offman, '83, and Ben Cutler, 
'84, sat at a terminal working with the 
New York Times Agency account. 
Hoffmann logged off and 20 minutes 
later tried to log on again, but the com-
puter did not recognize his password. 
It didn't make sense. He looked at a file 
that contains the number of passwords 
on the systems and saw it change while 
he watched. Suspicious, Cutler ran a 
program called "Finger," which lists 
who is on the computer, when, and 
where. At the same time, Hoffman ran 
a simpler program, "Who," which 
shows exactly whose accounts are 
working in the system and what they 
are doing. The program listed a 
friend's name, STONE, and Hoffman 
wondered out loud what he was doing 
on the machine. 

"I'm not doing anything. I'm not 
even logged on," said Larry Stone, '83 
as he walked up to the terminal. Some-
one, somewhere, had broken into 
Stone's account. 

"It was like a TV movie," Hoffman said. "We ran to Dunham lab to see if 
anybody was messing with the system 
there. We didn't see anyone. But we 
convinced the grad student on duty 
that there was something wrong. He 
intentionally crashed the computer." 

The computer was down and they 
"kiJled" the New York Times Agency 
account for three days. Meanwhile the 
agency lost more than $400, said Hoff-
man. But he was not the only one upset 
by the prank. The next day, John 
O'Donnell, head of the Computer 
Science Facilities, threatened to strip 
computer science majors of all 
privileges. Furious, O'Donnell sent 
this missile: 

"Someone has broken into Yale-
COMIX, using the network and ac-
counts broken into on other machines. 
"If this or similar incidents recur, all 
student accounts will be moved to a 
VMS machine at the Yale Computer 
Center. 
"Unless the violator or others come 
forward with explicit details on the ac-
cess technique used in the breakins BY 
THE FND OF THIS WEEK, all 
student 'lccounts will lose all network 
privileges, and all DEC-20 course ac-
counts 
will be restricted to CS 
coursework ONLY." 

Rajpal Sandhu, '83, fired back to 
O'Donnell on the computer bulletin 
board, "It is terribly annoying to find 
that every time there is a major 
breakin (ha ha?), the totality of majors 
get screwed- immediate incrimina-
tion. Security breaches are to be ex-
pected when 
we 
have protection 
systems ... n 

It was like telling English majors 
that because somebody ripped out all 
the pages from John Milton's Paradise 
Lost, they would have access to a 
library of only Nancy Drew mystery 
stories. The undergraduate majors 
were stunned but not shocked at 
O'Donnell's threat. "We call him JOD, 
because it rhymes with GOD," quipped 
Hoffman, "He never has time for 
undergrads." Another student, Charles 
Francois, '84, said O'Donnel threatens 
the use of his tyrannical power because 
lt gets results. "It's silly grade-school 
mentality- pulling us off the COM IX 
for this one security breach." 

But, even with the threat, O'Donnell 
admits chance are slim the vandal 
can be caught. He left no trace because 
he had access to O'Donnell's superuser 
account. "The only way they could 
catch him now is by accusing him and 
having him confess," said Hoffman. 

Stanley Eisenstat, 
director of 
graduate studies, said, "We haven't 
ruled out the possibility of catching 
him. But I don't think I want to talk 
about that." 

Associate Professor John Zornig of 
Electrical Engineering has strong 
suspicions, "The villain of the year Is 
now a music graduate student." He 
probably means Mark Tanner, '82, 
who worked for the Artificial In-
telligence project two years ago. He 
knew enough about the system to 
tamper with it, and although he has no 
student account, people say he has 
been seen around the facility. 

Tanner said, 
"I've 
only been 
downstairs (terminal room) once this 
year. They haven't said 'Boo' to me 
about this incident, and if they do I'm 
going to take them to court for harass-
ment." 

Last year Tanner used other 
people's passwords to look at private 
files. "It's wrong, I know. It's stupid. It 
was 3 a.m. and I wasn't thinking. It's 
over and done. I'm not willing to take 
the rap for all security breaches. They 
wanted my diploma for it last year. 
They didn't get it, I graduated, and 
now they're pissed." 

He added, "If I were to have an 
M. 0., it wouldn't be one of destruc-
tiveness, it's one of looking around. I 
have my own suspicions about who 
did it." But Tanner said the depart-
ment wasn't interested in listening to 
anybody. "The policy is guilty until 
you prove yourself innocent. n 

Since 1972, when the computer 
science department first offered classes 
to undergraduates, people have broken 
security. "At least a couple a year," said 
Professor Alan Perlis, director of 
undergraduate studies. Two years ago, 
a student programmed the computer 
so that when a student in an introduc-
tory course loggc;d on, the computer 
immediately logged him off. It had stu-
dents confused for days. The program-
mer was expelled. Last year two students 
experimented with a program that 
deleted "nodes" or directory files. For a 
while, the computer just deleted empty 
accounts, but it ran out of empty spaces 
and started erasing full ones. The 
students were reprimanded but not ex· 
pelled. 

As a result, Yale's computers are not 
open to just anyone. The administra-
tion has drawn a heavy line between 
access for faculty members, graduate 
students and the rest of the University. 
Most of the University, all introduc-
tory classes and some community 
businesses use the Yale Computer 
Center (YCC), where there is a large 
IBM computer and five brand-new 
VAX machines which run a system for 
general course use. 

The computer science department, 
however, reserves its superior equip-
ment for research. A recent National 
Science Foundation grant for $2.6 
million allowed the department to pur-
chase 15 new computers. Undergrads 
can use five of them, and computer 
science majors have privileged use of 
one VAX machine in the department. 
But it 
is a 
privilege continually 
threatened. 

The truth is that this machine, affec-
tionally 
called COMIX, is easily 
broken into. It runs UNIX, a research 
system designed by Bell Laboratories 
in 1970. Versatile, flexible and fast, 
UNIX is the Porsche of student 
systems- closest to intuitive reasoning 
and best for creative work. For that 
reason, it is also the hardest to secure. 

In fact, another computer jock, Mike 
Naunton, '83, later approached the 
facilities director with at least six ways 
some one could break in. 

One 
break-in 
method is simple, 
often used to plagiarize assignments. A 
student writes a program that mimics 
the terminal's "ready" mode. Some 
sucker sits down and unknowingly 
enters his password. Then the whole 
thing disappears; the program records 
the password. So the victim re-enters 
his code and, at this time really logs 
on. 

It's the oldest trick in the book, one 
an experienced computer hack would 
recognize immediately. It is unlikely 
that the vandal used this technique to 
break in. But the principle was un-
doubtedly the same. 

Even the department acknowledges 
that avid hacks could circumnavigate 
any security measures on the COM-
IX. Only Zornig questioned their 
prowess, "Are you so smug to think . 
there are that many leaks and you are 
that smart?" Naunton only shrugged, 
"Yes, sure. It's not a security system." 

So the department has struck an agree-
ment with the majors-anyone who 
suspects a leak will notify O'Donnell. 

Even the manual for upper level 
students describes ways to crash the 
UNIX system, overload disc space, 
and cause messes. But the first thing 
professors tell students in the course is, 
"Don't fuck with the system." And 
usually they don't . 

Everyone agrees there's nothing 
malicious about most break-ins. So 
why the ominous threats? "If we have 
students acting in an anti-social way, 
we must be brutal and cannot tolerate 
it," Perlis said. "It's exactly equal to 
vandalism, like walking into the gym-
nasium and ripping off ten lockers. 
And no one is kicking them off the 
VAX. 
We take 
these draconian 
measures because we have to say 
something strong." 

O'Donnell promised harsh action 
against the prankster- expulsion from 
the major and possible expulsion from 
the college. 

Perlis said, "These kids come out of 
high schools where they were kingpins. 
But they are immature. They've gotten 
used to being big shots on computers, 
they get here and they're walled in. 
Their egos can't take it. They've got to 
show how good they are, so they do 
something stupid like this." 

The problem is that no one can 
prove an undergraduate broke in. The 
computer science majors seem to feel 
this security break was just an excuse 
to restrict them further. "The depart-
ment sees us as a real nuisance, little 
brats. They have all this equipment, 
but they give us only one terminal. 
Then they even take that away," con-
fided Hoffman. 

The issue sparked a Deparmental 
Student Advisory Committee (DSAC) 
on Wednesday, September 22. They 
invited O'Donnell, Eizenstadt, and 
Zornig. About 33 students aired their 
concerns.
