~ "Nuuneg arn1s leaned over window .. 
~ sills, 
gnarled ebony legs carried 
55 groceries up double flights of steps, 
~ and saffron hands strung out wet laun-
dry on backyard lines ... they cursed, 
badgered, worshipped, and shared 
their men. They were 
hard~edged, 
soft-centered, brutally demanding and 
easily pleased ... " 


These black 
women are the characters in Gloria 
Naylor's first novel, The Women of 
Brtwsttr Place. 


Naylor, a graduate student in Afro-
Amer'can Studies, illustrates what it 
means to be a black woman today 
through the stories of the six "colored 
daugh~ers" of Brewster Place, a dead-
end neighborhood in a fictional New 
York City ghetto. Despite their diverse 
ages and backgrounds, their different 
shades of ebony, cinnamon, nutmeg 
and saffron, these women all come to 
share a common bond- their neigh-
borhood. Twice abandoned, first by its 
white founding fathers and then by the 
Italian immigrants who followf"d, 
Brewster Place is now a run-down 
haven for the "Afric children" in search 
of new beginnings. 


The seven stories that make up the 
novel tell the history behind each 
woman's move to Brewster Place. The 
reader follows them from girlhood into 
womanhood, finding that, because 
they are all black and female, they 
shared some of the same difficulties 
with 
prejudice and discrimination 
while growing up, despite their dif-
ferences in class or background. But, 
they all come to Brewster Place a little 
wary of each other. They do not 
recognize their similarities because 
they are blinded by their differences. 


The lesbian is ostracized because the 
others cannot understand her love for 
another woman. The college-educated 
suburbanite who willingly comes to 
Brewster Place to "be with her people" 
finds that she has trouble understan-
ding the other black women in the 
neighborhood and they cannot under-
stand her. The free-spirited wom an 
who has many lovers is distrusted by 
the others because they fear she will try 
to steal their men. 


The jealousy and susp1c10n among 
these women keeps them apart. It is 
not until one of the lesbians is 
raped and murdered that they realize 
their common bond- they are all 
struggling to survive in a world which 
discriminates against them, not only 
because of their race, but because of 
their gender as well. They try to 
rebuild Brewster Place, to make it a 
safer and cleaner place to live, and in 
doing so they create a new unity. 


Through their common struggle to 
survive we see that this is a novel about 
black sisterhood, and it is Naylor's 
delicate development of this sisterhood 
that is most impressive and moving in 
the novel. 


Gloria Naylor is a native New 
Yorker who attended Brooklyn College 
and now studies Afro-American 
Studies and Critical Theory at Yale. 
She recalled in a recent interview the 
frustration she felt as an under-
graduate during the mid-1970s, when 
black literature meant the literature of 
black men, and women's studies of-
fered only the literature of white 
women . 


"I was running back and forth across 
campus trying very hard to find 
something that might reflect me and 
reflect my reality. When I would ap-
proach some of my professors and I 
would tell them that in these literature 
courses I would like to do a paper on 
the works of black women, let's say 
from 
1900-1930, 
I'd get derisive 
remarks like, 'Go ahead, but you won't 
find much'." That was when Naylor 
decided that if she were to become a 
writer she would write about black 
women "to do something -to fill that 
void" that she found in literature. 


The Women of Brewster PWce provides 
such a powerful characterization of 
black sisterhood that strong, constant 
rela tionships between black women 
and black men are rarely apparent. 
M attie, a middle-aged mother figure, 
comforts Ciel, a younger woman who 
seeks solace after the death of her only 
child . . Mattie symbolizes strong black 
womanhood, and her relationship with 
Ciel is far more potent and genuine 
than that between Ciel and her lover. 


The men rarely seem to be as strong as 
the women and are frequently absent 
from their lives, making it appear that

one relationship excludes the other. 
Naylor emphasizes the importance 
of not accentuating the relationships 
between men and women in the nove). 
"The bonding that has existed 
historically between women is not pre-
sent or is not given the foreground (in 
literature) that I think it should, and 
that was what I tried to do in Brewster 
PltJce." 


Perhaps the most sensitive aspect of 
the novel is Naylor's depiction of two 
lesl:iian lovers, Theresa and Lorraine, 
known merely as "The Two" by their 
neighbors. Their arrival at Brewster 
Place continues a desperate search for 
acceptance after humiliating rejection 
elsewhere. But even in Brewster they 
meet with suspicion and hostility: 
"Their regular exits and entrances to 
the block were viewed with a jaundiced 
eye. The quiet that rested around their 
door on the weekends hinted of all sorts 
of secret rituals, and their friendly in-
difference to the men on the street was 
an insult to the women as a brazen 
flaunting of unnatural ways." 


The struggle to define the true 
meaning of sisterhood among the 
women of Brewster Place is painfully 
illustrated in their difficulty 
in 
understanding their lesbian sisters. It 
is only after one of "The Two" is 
murdered in a brutal and bloody rape 
that the other women realize a com-
mon bond with Lorraine and Theresa, 
based simply on their mutual struggle 
to survive as women. Naylor uses the 
rape as a unifying force because she 
feels 
that 
it 
is 
the "common 
denominator for all women, regardless 
of class, race, or sexual preference. We 
are all not only potential victims of 
rape, but we live in a society which has 
a rape mentality as far as who we are as 
entities." Lorraine's rape therefore 
makes each of the women realize "that 
the lack of comfort, the lack of female 
bonding which should have been there 
for every woman, regardless of whom 
she chose to love, was not." They need-
ed to be reminded that "under the skin, 
they were all sisters."
