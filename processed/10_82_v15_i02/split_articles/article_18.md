weapons to the world. The point is that 
there is a march of technology in 
science and you can't just stop it by 
fiat. 

T NJ: Does that worry you that . . . 
AB: That a lot of small countries have 
these devices? Yes, of course it does. 
And what worries me more is that 
there are weapons in hands of ad-
ministrations and ruling groups that 
are certainly not very stable, and I 
don't think terribly responsible. 

T NJ: How do you react when you read 
articles in the paper about things like 
the anti-nuclear rally in New York, 
where half a million people marched 
into Central park protesting the pro-
liferation of nuclear arms? 

AB: I am turned ofT by these large pro-
ductions. When I talk to people com-
ing back from these large productions 
now, a lot of them have no idea of why 
they went except that they felt that they 
missed the ones in the '60s and this is a 
golden opportunity to find out what 
kind of a social experience it was. 
I don't think it has the slightest im-
pact whatever on any policy. 
A few reasoned letters to Congressen 
and Senators are vastly more effective 
than a group of people thrashing 
around Central Park or in Washing-
ton, because any group that has Jane 
Fonda as the centerpiece is not going to 
get very much of a hearing in responsi-
ble circles. 

TNJ: You travelled to the U .S.S.R. 
and you served on the President's 
scientific advisory committee. How do 
you think our policy should be carried 
out towards the Soviets? 

AB : I'm afraid that I don't feel that the 
Soviets have changed their goals 
substantially since 1917. And that's 
something that we have to keep in 
mind. 

TNJ: Those goals being? 
~ : Those goals being world domina-
tion. 

TNJ: So you think that in any agree-
ment we enter into, we cannot trust 
what they say? 

~ : Of course not! If we can verify it, 
af we can independently check it out 
then by all means we should make 
every attempt we can of this sort. But 
you don't have to go very far back to 
recognize that the Soviets interpret 
some of these agreements very dif-
ferently than we would. 

TNJ: Do you think anything like 
SALT II or any other treaties are ad-
visable? 

AB: We should certainly work toward 
them. 

TNJ: Have we been naive so far in our 
dealings with them? 

AB: Some of us certainly have. Some 
haven't. 

TNJ: Some being? 
AB: I certainly am not going to answer 
that. 

TNJ: I'd like to ask you more personal 
questions about your own involvement 
with Yale. Could you explain just 
what an accelerator does? 

AB: An accelerator is, for all practical 
purposes, nothing more than a giant 
microscope which allows us to look 
deep inside nuclei. The smaller the 
thing that you are looking at, the big-
ger the microscope you need to achieve 
that look. 

TNJ: So the research that you do is 
basic? 

AB: All the research that we do is fully 
basic research. 

TNJ: Have you seen practical applica-
tion for the sorts of discoveries that 
you've made here? 

AB: Very much so. We have, for ex-
ample, seen substantial amounts of our 
work appearing in nuclear medicine. 
We've seen a lot of our very recent 
work appearing in geophysics, in the 
understanding of deposition of mineral 
bodies and so on. 
We have discovered why it is that 
computers, apparently for no reason at 
all, 
every so 
often just make 
mistakes- what 
are called "soft 
failures." That's because a charged par-
ticle coming in from outer space plows 
through the computer memory and 
resets it. We now know how that hap-
pens and we know how to correct it 
and we know how to avoid making it 
worse. 

TNJ: And in nuclear medicine, what 
advances have we seen there? 

AB: One of the most important things 
that nuclear medical folks have to do is 
to find the right radioisotope to give 
patients either for diagnostic purposes 
or for clinical treatment purposes. 
One of the projects we worked on 
recently is, I think, going to be very 
important in term s of telling us how we 
have to build the inner wall- that's the 
really important engineering prob-
lem - how to build the inner wall of a 
fusion reactor so that we can liberate 
the energies of the sun here on the 
earth. 

TNJ: H ow far do you think we are 
from fusion? 

AB: I think we'll show that we can do it 
in the laboratory within a year or so, 
but it would take probably 30 years at 
the min imum before we can do enough 
of the engineering to make it an effec-
tive power source. So we have some-
thing like 30 years and that's the in-
terim period where, I think, we have to 
use everything we've got-coal, oil, 
gas, nuclear- but I don't see us using 
nuclear fission after we get fusion. 

TNJ: And this laboratory here will be 
working on developing ways so that fu-
sion will .. . 

AB: Nothing as specific as that. For 
example, one of our students has been 
looking at the whole question of put-
ting together the fundamental forces of 
nature. Are all the forces of elec-
tromagnetism, the forces that give you 
radioactivity, that give you nuclear 
energy, 
really just one and the 
same force! This was Einstein's dream, 
and he failed to get it. But we're hot on 
his trail now and one of the things that 
one of our students here has just been 
looking at really nails down a key piece 
of this. It pushes us in the direction of 
saying, yes they are one and the same. 
Another of our students has just 
finished a project in which we set out to 
see if we could find any trace of the 
gi:'lnt supernova stellar explosion that 
trtggered the formulation of the solar 
system four-and-a-half billion years 
ago. We found a trace of this. It turns 
out you can find it in meteorites that 
have been cruising around in outer 
space until very recently, and then 
plow into the earth. You get them, take 
them apart and look at the various 
nuclei. You can get a measure of how 
far back this supernova was. And so we 
cover the complete spectrum- any-
thing that we consider good science is 
fair game. 

TNJ: H ow can we go about educating 
the public on crucial matters such as 
our shortage of non-renewable energy 
sources and uses of nuclear energy; 
and what is the role of the scientific 
community in this regard? 

AB: We've got to spend a hell of a lot 
more of our time than we have in the 
past talking to the public, telling peo-
ple what we're up to in science. One, 
because it after all is an accounting we 
owe to the public, because the public 
pays for all of this. Secondly, we have 
to do this to develop a new constituen-
cy for science in this country. At the 
moment, we're just beginning to face 
up to the fact that science and 
technology are just other claimants for 
the public tax dollar. And we don't 
have a large constituency as compared 
to the hot lunch constituency, even 
though I think we have a tremendous 
contribution to make to national well-
being. 

T NJ: H ow do we, who are at the mer-
cy of people with 
vastly 
more 
knowledge . .. 

AB: You're never at the mercy, don't 
put it that way. 

TNJ: Do we make informed decisions? 

AB: If a democracy is going to work, it 
means that we've got to have an educa-
tional system so that a person can at 
least be able to understand the issues, 
never mind the details. It's up to the 
members of the public to ask the ques-
tions and demand answers from the 
people who are supposed to know what 
the details are. 
That's part of the trouble in this 
whole question of radioactive waste, 
for example. The Atomic Energy 
Commission made terrible m istakes in 
the early days of the program because 
they just simply said, "Don't bother us, 
we know what we're doing, we'll take 
care of it." It's the public's fault for ac-
cepting that kind of nonsense. The 
public should have said, "Wait a 
minute, you say you know what you're 
doing, but we don't know." 
The public, as the electorate in a 
democracy, has to listen to the answers 
they get from people from all differe~t 
opinions and then m ake up _the1r 
m inds. T hat's what democracy IS all 
about.
