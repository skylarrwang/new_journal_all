Now Available At the Co-op 
OUT -OF-PRINT SEARCH SERVICE 
Have you looked for an old favorite or a needed book 
for reference and discovered that it is no longer available? 
The Yale Co-op will now search for any out-of-print title. 
Simply fill out a form in the Book Department. Our staff can 
assist you. No general requests please, we will search 
only for specific titles. 
Most searches take from 4-12 weeks. However, if not 
available at first, your request can be kept on file for up to 
five years. If a copy is located, the price will first be quoted 
to you. Prices are determined by availability and condition; 
OP books often command a premium price. 
There is no obligation to buy when a price is quoted, but 
should you accept the quote, full payment is required at 
that time. It may then take several weeks for the book to 
arrive. All books offered are sold on a first-come, first-
served basis, so it is best to respond as soon as possible.
