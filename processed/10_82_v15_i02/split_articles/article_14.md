Over the wires 
Old phone systems never die, it seems, 
they just get rewired. At least that's 
what's happening, slowly but surely, to 
Yale's Centrex phone service, which 
U niversity 
leases from 
Southern New England Telephone 
Com pany (SNET). Working from a 
circuitry blueprint so intricate it would 
make an engineer's heart soar, the Yale 
Communications Department is in the 
midst of a five-year rewiring project 
that will do away with Centrex and 
allow Yale to manage its own phone 
system by as early as the first quarter 
of 1985. 

It's no small project. All told, the 
engineers will have to rewire about 
14,000 phone lines in an estimated 234 
Yale buildings. When it's over and 
done with, your monthly phone bill 
will come from Mother Yale, instead of 
Ma Bell, and phone charges will 
graciously appear on the Bursar's Bill. 

T he switch is all part of Yale's effort 
to keep up with the changing times and 
the burgeoning private telephone in-
dustry only recently made possible by 
the federal deregulation of AT&T. A 
result of the anti-trust settlement 
earlier this year is that businesses and 
ins~itutions can now legally purchase 
the1r own phone systems. According to 
Yale Communications, the big advan-
tage of owning a private system is that 
Yale will be able to circumvent SNET 
rate hikes, phone rental costs and in-
stallation fees, which have been steadi-
ly on the rise. "The idea behind the 
project," said Mike Grunder, manager 
of Yale Communications, "is to offer 
the most efficient service as cost-
effectively as possible." And for Yale, 
cost effectiveness is more a necessity 
than a virtue: The University spends 
about $5 million a year on calls, and 
that figure does not even include stu-
dent calls which Yale Communica-
tions cons~rvatively estimates amount 
to $2 million yearly. 

Yale Communications 
has just 
recently completed the first phase of 
the project: the 6,000-line, 34-building 
M edical School system . Rather than 
using Centrex, the Medical School and 
Yale-New H aven Hospital now have a 
brand new Private Business Exchange 
(PBX), a system bought from Nor-
thern Telecom, 
a 
Canadian-based 
company. The PBX handles all local 
and intracampus calls, but long 
distance 
is still 
switched 
through 
SNET. The rates the Med School now 
pays are comparable to SNET rates. 
But in about five years the pilot Med 
School project will have paid for itself, 
Grunder speculates, and within ten 
years the Med School will actually be 
saving money on the system.
