If every member of the Yale Symphony were to play "Bulldog" in a different key, the sound would be something like theater at Yale: while talent and energy abound, there is surprisingly little coordination among the various groups. When the choice performance weekends roll around, it is as if The Great Race has just begun: each team dashes around campus armed with flyers, posters, and table tents; signboards outside Yale Station battle for the premium spots; and dining halls fill with the sounds of spoons tapping glasses, heralding energetic announcements. It is all very colorful and exciting to witness, but how healthy is it for theater at Yale? 

"I worry about this campus," said Sally Rosenberg, co-director of the Ezra Stiles Dramat, "The amount of theater is wonderful. Over 30 productions went up last spring. But because there's so much, there's a tendency towards competition. And it's not just, 'Oh, no, our show's going up this weekend so we've got to publicize and get the audiences.' It has the potential to be destructive sometimes-like who gets the call in first to the lighting man." 

The problem stems partly from shortages- from lights and platforms to time and space- and partly from poor communication. Dramats are hesitant to lend out equipment because it has not been returned in the past. They have recently lost several key rehearsal and performance spaces. And they have always scheduled their performances independently, with only partial knowledge of other groups' plans. There once was a College Dramat Council, an organization designed to address these problems, but it rarely met, and Rosenberg said it was "not very structured." 

Now, David Loud, head of Yale Musical Theater (YMT), is leading a movement to unite the college dramats under a revitalized College Dramat Council. Loud wants to transform the loose, lackadaisical Council of the past into a cohesive unit that can exert influence when appropriate.

When the choice performance weekends roll around, It Is as If the Great Race has just begun. 

Council a month ago created a lot of enthusiasm among those who attended. "This one is going to go places, seriously go places," said Jaji Packard, co-director of the Trumbull Dramat. Discussion focused on the problems of scheduling and of finding rehearsal and performance space. 

Loud sees the Council as both a uniting front in the fight for theater space and as a forum for communication among the college dramats. "I think if people are communicating, the red tape of theater at Yale would be diminished and directors could spend more time directing their shows," Loud said. 

Scheduling is the primary concern. Last spring when Jesus Christ Superstar went up at Ezra Stiles, students either bought tickets and sat, sardine-style, within yellow-taped lines on the dining hall floor, or didn't see any show at all that weekend. That was because the dramat heads had heard that the rock opera was going to be outstanding and they didn't want to open opposite a rumored hit. The result: seven shows opened the following weekend, several suffering poor houses. 

Amy Ludwig, YMT board member, co-director of the Trumbull Dramat and a board member of the new Dramat Council, believes that the clustering of shows is most often a result of the dramats avoiding "big academic events"- midterms, finals, the start of classes and so forth. "These weekends exist," Ludwig explains, "but they're just not feasible." 

Although there are certainly weekends during the term in which no one has time to either produce or attend a show, there could be better distribution. Loud suggests that the members could consult with each other about the dates of their shows. "There's nothing we can do to stop nine shows from going up in a weekend, but presumably it's in everybody's interest not to do that," Loud said. 

Preventing such scheduling mishaps requires participation from all fronts, Loud said. "We want the Council to be made up of as many different groups as possible. Any theater group could send a representative to the Council and it would be great." 

But Hillary Gitelman, board member of the Yale Dramat, is wary of participating. "We really can't be a part of the Dramat Council because it looks like we're stepping in and trying to take over. And that's the furthest thing from our mind." Gitelman feels uneasy about the relationship between the Yale Dramat and the college dramats. "Everyone's always saying that they don't like us out there. The relationship has been strained or non-existent out of misunderstanding." And that's unfortunate, Gitelman says, because "we can help them and they can certainly help us." 

The Yale Dramat and the college dramats are especially in a position to lend each other support now, as each group searches for a solution to what is perhaps campus theater's biggest problem- finding space. "We just want the University to provide us with space- not even a theater space-just a big David Loud, head of the Yale Musical Theater room somewhere that all the colleges could share," Loud said. 

Although there has always been a shortage of space, recent developments have made the problem even more severe. The Educational Center for the Arts lost a federal subsidy last year, driving its rental fee beyond the means of college dramats. 

The Yale Dramat recently lost its
