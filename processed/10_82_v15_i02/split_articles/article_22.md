drove a Chevrolet or an Olds rather

was somethmg about the angle oT her 
head and the way she walked that was 
rather regal," her friend Ann Conklin 
explained. "She could wear what she 
chose; it was her bearing that made it 
look well." 


"A_ real Yankee in a good sense," ac-
cordmg to the Reverend Fidler, 
Trowbridge liked to do things for 
herself. When she wanted to meet a 
new person in town, she did not reach 
for a telephone. She walked up to the 
front door and rang the bell. 


Less than a year after Trowbridge 
carne home from Westover School in 
1917, her father died. "She was pretty 
much confined to her home for a long 
while," said Clement. Cheney added 
that though Trowbridge was the right 
age at that tme, "she never 'came out,' 
was never presented to society . . . and 
her parents were very austere about 
men." One way or another, she never 
married. 


Trowbridge and her half-sister 
Elsie, lived with her mother until Mrs: 
Trowbridge died in 1945. Trowbridge 
was 46 then, and her half-sister was 68. 
Though she was always independent, 
Trowbridge felt responsible for her 
half-sister, who was deaf and not 
very mobile, and she tried to involve 
her in as many -"·tivities as possible, 
cousin Franklin .. arrel said. Whc:n 
Elsie Trowbridge died in 1967, Rachel


Brewster she said with a smile, "The 
~ streets belong to the people'-they 
must mean us!" When a bomb explod-
1 ed in the hockey rink, rocking the 
i 
whole neighborhood, Trowbridge told 
Chauncey, "Why should I worry? It's 
just. a little thunder." 


Chauncey suggested · that Trow-
bridge move out of town for a while at 
Yale's expense, but she refused. She 
finally consented to let one campus 
policeman sit in the house while the 
National Guard assembled around the 
campus. "She knew what was going 
on," Chauncey said. "She understood 
why the students were upset .. . if she 
had been 19 or 20, she probably would 
have been right out there with 'em." 


What made Trowbridge so well 
known in New Haven was her philan-
thropy. She gave both time and money 
to many organizations, from the New 
Haven Symphony to the United Way, 
,Put her first love was the New Haven 
· Children's Center, a residential facility 
for disturbed children that was foun-
ded with her grandfather's help in 
1833. Her father served on the 
Center's board of directors, and 
Trowbridge took up the tradition in 
1923. Her main job was to raise money 
for the Center. She saw the Center 
change over the years, 
replacing 
around-the-clock volunteers with 
eight-hour day professional social 
workers, exchanging rows of white 
iron beds and matching uniforms for 
more individualized care. Her ad-
ministrative role limited her contact 
with the children, but some Center 
alumni remember a party at 46 
Hillhouse where she arranged for pony 
rides around the formal garden. 


Trowbridge was highly religious, 
and belonged to every group and com-
mittee of the Trinity Church on the 
Green except the men's club. She sup-
ported and worked with the New 
Haven Preservation Trust, the Clifford 
Beers Clinic and even the Yale-in-
China program. "One of a vanishing 
breed," said Reverdy Whitlock of the 
New Haven Preservation Trust, 
"Rachel felt that privileges carried with 
them responsibilities. She was genu-
inely concerned with bettering the 
human condition, and she saw New 
Haven, in particular, as a vineyard she 
had to till." 


Trowbridge was alone in 46 Hillhouse 
for the firs~ time in her 68 years. 


Elsie Trowbridge was reclusive and 
set in her ways, but Rachel 
Trowbridge was very modern in her 
outlook and was always interested in 
what young people were thinking. Ac-
cording to Lawson Willard, former 
rector of Trinity Church on the Green, 
she helped persuade the Episcopal 
Church to approve Planned Parent-
hood fifty years ago, and had been a 
supporter ever since . 


Though 
Trowbridge was used to dining on 
silver in her upstairs-downstairs house, 
she was just as happy having a noisy 
dinner in the kitchen with the hubbub 
of children all around her, said cousin 
Lisa Totman. "Rachel lived so much in 
the present," Chauncey said, "she was 
never an 'old' person." 


The demonstrations and student 
unrest in the 'sixties, much of it in front 
of then-President Kingman Brewster's 
house and just outside Trowbridge's 
windows, did not bother her a bit, said 
Chauncy. On the contrary, he con-
tinued, "she loved every minute of it. It 
fascinated her." Mary Louise Brewster 
remembered the weekend before May 
Day in 1970, when students painted 
"THE STREETS BELONG TO THE 
PEOPLE" in huge letters up Hillhouse 
Avenue. Trowbridge owned her one 
lot on upper Hillhouse, and Yale

Chauncey solicited 
funds 
from 
Trowbridge only once, on behalf of the 
Yale-New Haven Hospital. When he 
spoke to her, she had already read all 
the materials he sent and knew exactly 
what to say. She had given once before 
and had been promised that a room 
would be named after her. Later, when 
she called the hospital, there was no 
such room. She did not like that. "But," 
she said, "I won't hold that against 
you," and she proceeded to give twice 
the amount Chauncey had planned to 
request. Trowbridge's generosity was 
~ unsual, said Willard, that the IRS 
anvestigated her repeatedly during the 
last 15 years. They always found her 
honest. 


Trowbridge never took life too 
leriously. "She had a wonderful sense 
of the ridiculous," said Mrs. William 
Reynolds, a long-time friend. Once: 
when President GriswaJd suggested 
that the half-sisters donate their 
backyard to Yale as the site for the pro-
posed Kline Science building, she and 
Elsie called up to say th~y had decided 
instead to bequeath the entire property 
to a local divinity school. "You know," 
she chuckled to Chauncey, "it really 
made him mad!" Trowbridge used to 
sit in her window every year and watch 
the big Hallowe'en party in front of the 
President's house. 


Mary Louise 
Brewster summed up Trowbridge's at-
titude as "amused with life. She 
watched Yale with, not a jaundiced, 
but a wry eye." 


The house Trowbridge lived in since 
1906 was built in 1632 in the then-
popular Greek Revival style. It is brick 
with a grooved stucco facing, original-
ly painted white to suggest stone. The 
house 
was a 
popular 
success, 
it served as a model for at least nine 
other temple houses in Connecticut. 
Remodeled extensively and painted 
reddish-brown in 1656, it was bought 
by Trowbridge's father around 1906. 
As it stands today, the New Haven 
She watched Yale with not 
a jaundiced, but a wry eye. 
Preservation Trust calls 
it "New 
Haven's finest Greek Revival house." 


Inside, half a dozen enormous, high-
ceilinged rooms on the first floor are 
furnished with exquisite Victorian fur-
niture, each room arranged to feel 
spacious but not spare, each piece 
placed perfectly to suggest dignity, 
opulence, and comfort, without a 
wasted detail or a hint of clutter. In 
one room a marble nude rests on a tall 
onyx pillar. An ornate fireplace and a 
grand piano dominate another room, 
and a third contains a petite walnut 
and beveled glass case displaying oval 
miniatures of the Trowbridge family 
carefully spaced across a tufted satin 
pillow. Worn Persian rugs cover pa~­

floors , 
elaborate cornice 
mouldings and velvet valences float 
above the high window tops, and on 
the light-patterned papered walls, old 
oils hang in huge gilt frames. The Tif-
fany lamps lighting almost every room 
were bought when they were the latest

style; the furniture was all in the family 
before Trowbridge was born. "None of 
this is m ine," she used to say. 


A warm panelled room in the back 
surrounds a regal slate billiard table-
resting on massive feet, and a triad of 
glowing Tiffany-style windows il-
lumine the adjoining alcove. Beyond 
them, an elaborate formal garden is 
carefully tended in the spacious yard 
facing Prospect Street. Upstairs, the 
ample bedrooms sport high four-poster 
and shining brass beds. In the latches 
of the doors are big old-style warded 
keys. "Rachel led a conventional life," 
the Reverend Fidler said, "given that 
she lived in a palace." 


The house she bequeathed to Yale, 
but the studiously arranged 
fur-
nishings within will probably be scat-
tered among Yale, the New Haven 
Historical Society, and Trowbridge's 
relatives said Farrel. He added that "it 
looks like the will will take a long time 
to settle." Right now, 
not even 
Trowbridge's lawyer will g\.less at the 
size of her estate. 


University Secretary John Wilkin-
son acknowledged that "Yale Universi-
ty has known we would get [the house] 
for some time, but they did not expect 
it so quickly . . . it came as quite a 
suprise." No decision has been made 
about the future of 46 Hillhouse, but 
Wilkinson said the University will not 
alter the exterior. Since the rest of the 
block is devoted to social sciences, he 
predicted that by late fall some social 
science department or institute will 
move in as the two Irish maids move 
out. The house is an extraordinary ac-
quisition for Yale, but those who knew 
her feel that the loss of Rachel 
Trowbridge to the New Haven com-
munity is greater still. Standing on the 
back steps of 46 Hillhouse, the maid 
could only say, "God must ha' been 
angry with us. Our hearts are broke."
