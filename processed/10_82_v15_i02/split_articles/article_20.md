Jeff Ho.flman '83, saw tk 
computer crime in progress. 
students are usually tense, but the at-
mosphere was light with jokes and 
jabs. 
"It's an attitude problem," said 
O'Donnell, "Loopholes in the security 
system are not a problem in a com-
munity of honorable people. The 
undergraduate took no responsibility 
for this break-in. I don't want to clean 
up after what happened this fall." 
DSAC suggested that students ad-
minister the COMIX, move it to 
YCC, where they can "appeal to their 
own kind," joked Sandhu. O'Donnell 
would cease to be a target for revenge 
this way, said Sandhu. 
O'Donnell said, "I certainly never 
wanted this hostile climate. Maybe we 
can spend time breaking and patching 
the system, add security. But first"he was 
adamant, "there must be change in at-
titude." Zornig chimed in, "You've got 
to explain it's not cute. Say, 'Hey Bim-
bo, what did you do that for?" 
Hoffman agrees some attitude must 
change. But whose? Hoffman said, 
"All they care about is how they look. 
The machines are a symbol of the 
department, and if security is broken, 
~ey don't look as good. Yale's attitude 
IS backwards."
