he and several colleagues examine atomic par-
ticles on Yale~ "Emperor, particle accelerator. 
! The machine, which is the largest of its type 
t in the world, is located inconspicuously 
7> beneath the grassy knoll on Science Hill. 

Professor Bromley has much experience 
and recognition outside of Yale. He serves as 
a director of United Illuminating, which 
provides electricity for New Haven from a 
variety of sources including the Connecticut 
Yankee nuclear power plant. He was a 
Senior Research Officer at the Chalk River 
Laboratory in Canada, where he pioneered 
early research on particle accelerators. In ad-
dition to basic nuclear research the Chalk 
River Laboratory tests designs for nuclear 
power facilities. In 1960, Bromley came to 
Yale as an Associate Professor and was 
tenured within a year~ time. 

Since then, Bromley has taken an active 
public role as one of the nation's best known 
scientific spokesmen. In January 1982, he 
was elected Chairman of the Board of the 
American Association for the Advancement of 
Science. He also serves as Chairman of the 
White House &ience Council, which advises 
the President on science policy. 

Bromley~ reputation extends around the 
world. He has received 6 honorary degrees 
from such Universities as Frankfurt in Ger-
many and Witwatersrand in South Africa. 
He also serves on the joint Committee on 
Cooperation between the U. S. Department of 
Energy and the U.S.S.R. State Committee 
on Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energ)l. 

Back home, Bromley has caused some con-
troversy with his outspoken stands on impor-
tant issues. He has outraged conservatives by 
publicly attacking Reagan's science policy, 
and liberals by forcefully advocating the use of 
nuclear power. 

Professor Bromley has also integrated his 
role as scientist and science advocate at Yale 
by 
teaching 
undergraduate courses like 
Science and Public Policy. The course 
emphasizes the social and political aspects of 
science and science policy. He is the author of 
over 300 articles and the editor of 13 books. 

The New Journal: You've been an ad-
vocate of nuclear energy and have 
been involved with the Connecticut 
Yankee Power Plant. How do you view 
the recent resurgence of opposition to 
nuclear power? 

Allan Bromley: I think it's very unfor-
tunate. The resurgence, if you look at 
it carefully at the moment, is not 
against nuclear power; it really is 
against nuclear war, and no sane per-
son can be otherwise but against 
nuclear war. The forces that are at-
tempting to deprive the U.S. of the 
nuclear option in its energy package 
have been singularly adroit in tying in 
the public mind nuclear energy to 
nuclear war. The two are totally, in my 
view, unconnected. It's much the same 
way as saying that a forest fire is ob-
viously a dreadful thing, but that 
doesn't mean that you shouldn't have 
fires in your fireplaces. 

TNJ: So you think the opponents of 
nuclear power are misled or misin-
formed in some way? 

AB: The vast majority of people who 
are currently very active in this area, I 
think, are very well-meaning, well-
intended people who unfortunately are 
acting on incomplete information. 

TNJ: Do you think the opponents of 
nuclear power or the public in general 
should be able to decide where a 
nuclear plant should be placed or 
whether it should operate? 

AB: Most of our citizens have, over 
the years, come to believe that energy 
is some kind of fundamental right of 
the citizen, and there's nothing wrong 
with that except that they also believe 
that it somehow is produced by the 
tooth fairy and that the tooth fairy 
always operates in someone 
else's 
backyard. 

TNJ: W auld you have a nuclear power 
plant in your backyard? 

AB: It isn't big enough, but I would be 
delighted to have one because a 
nuclear power plant, as far as I'm con-
cerned, is one of the most benign 
neighbors that I can conceive of. 

TNJ: More benign, say, than an oil 
refinery or . . . 

AB: Much more so ...


TNJ: . . . or a coal-burning . . . 

AB: Much more so, because the en-
vironmental effiuent from such a large 
reactor is very much less than .for 
comparable 
facilities 
fueled 
other 
ways. 

TNJ: So when opponents of nuclear 
power come up and say they're afraid 
of a melt-down or other potential risks, 
are they misled or are they overreac-
ting to the situation? 

AB: They're overreacting. There have 
been no meltdowns except under con-
trolled conditions where someone was 
doing an experiment, trying to find out 
what would happen in a meltdown. 
For example, there as no meltdown at 
Three Mile Island. Three Mile Island 
taught us one very important thing: 
that it's much harder to get a meltdown 
than people had realized. 

TNJ: How dangerous was the situa-
tion at Three Mile Island? 

AB: There was no danger at any time 
of anything happening outside the 
plant, none whatsoever. The max-
imum exposure that anybody got at 
any time was about 35 millirem, which 
is about a third of what any citizen in 
New Haven gets just minding his own 
business living in his own home for a 
year. But Three Mile Island was made 
into a potentially dangerous situation 
from the point of view of psychological 
damage to the citizenry and the danger 
?f citizens running one another down 
m their panic to escape from that part 
of the world. It's not surprising when 
responsible people start publishing 
headlines and say we're about to lose 
Pennsylvania. 

TNJ: How do you propose stopping 
that? 

AB: The NRC [Nuclear Regulatory 
~ommission] and the utility industries 
•? this country have already taken ac-
tlon, and there is already an emergen-
cy force ready to go immediately to 
any site of major difficulty of this kind, 
and the NRC is much better organized 
to provide authoritative information. 
The important thing we learned, 
however, beyond the importance of 
adequate communications, was that 
the people who operate power reactors 
must be trained and paid just as well 
as, for an example, 747 pilots. The 
level of training for operators of the 
U.S. civilian nuclear power system has 
gone up by a quantum jump after 
Three Mile Island. It's unfortunate 
that it took Three Mile Island to do 
that. 

TNJ: I've been through Connecticut 
Yankee, and it seems like most of what 
they do is sit around and watch dials. 

AB: That's absolutely true. It is weeks 
and weeks of boredom punctuated by 
moments of utter terror when 
something lets go and bearings catch 
fire and you get a short circuit in some 
system and things really start going 
bad. What these people are trained 
and paid for is coping with the 
unusual, not the usual. 

TNJ: So how safe, in your opinion, is 

AB: 
Nothing, 
nothing done by 
humans is absolutely safe. And so the 
question you really have to ask is, "Is 
the benefit that you gain commen-
I would prefer to live near a 
nuclear power plant than 
near a dam. 
surate or better than the risk to which 
you are exposed? And in the case of 
nuclear energy, I feel that the overall 
risk is substantially less than in any 
other major energy production pro-
grams, with the possible exception of 
natural gas-which, 
unfortunately; 
most of us don't have access to. 

TNJ: Do you think it's logical to pro-
duce radioactive waste at this time 
when there seems to be no overall 
agreement about what should be done 
with it? 

AB: It's not, as most people claim, that 
we don't know what to do with nuclear 
waste. It's simply that the quantities 
are still small enough that we don't 
have to commit to any given policy, 
but we want to be sure that before we 
do, we've picked the absolute best one. 

TNJ: The nuclear power industry is 
currently pushing a bill through the 
House of Repr<!sentatives that would
