God and Frum at Yale 
David Frum ('82) has hit upon a more 
congenial forum for 
his arch-
conservative views than the editorial 
page of the Yale Daily News. In the Oc-
tober 1 issue of the National Review, 
Frum wrote an article about his days at 
Yale called "'A Memo to the Freshman 
Class." 

Last year, Frum became one of the 
most controversial figures on cjlmpus. 
H is weekly column in the YDN, called 
"Juvenalia" (which means youthful 
works in Latin), provoked dozens of 
letters of protest and angry responses 
for 
the conservative opinions it 
presented. Frum relished the con-
troversy. "I like causing fuss," he told 
The Ntw Journal last spring ("The Fuss 
Over Frum" TN], April 19, 1982). 

"A Memo to the Freshman Class," is 
vintage Frum. It resembles his earlier 
column in the YDN by seeming to 
deliberately provoke liberals. The arti-
cle begins by describing the situation 
that led the editors of the Daily News to 
ask him to write a weekly column. "'It 
was, I think, the sight of me reeling 
through the streets of New Haven ear-
ly 
in 
the 
morning of President 
Reagan's election, brandishing 
empty bottles of champagne 
bellowing 'Happy Days are 
again!'" 

Frum goes on to assess the political 
mood at Yale. He keeps to his earlier 
theme that Yale is basically a liberal 
campus where people's opinions 
change with the political climate. "As a 
result, liberal Yale looked very radical 
in 1970, and liberal Yale looks rather 
conservative in 1982," he writes. 

Frum says he found being a conser-
vative at Yale was not very difficult. 
"'In my first year, conservatism was still 
a zany cult; by my last, it was a lively 
minority." Frum also notes that "civili-
ty, by and large, once again flourishes 
like ivy at Yale, and the intimidation of 
dissidents that was one of the dis-
tasteful features of the bad decade 1965 
to 1975, usually known as 'the Sixties,' 
takes more subtle-and therefore more 
bearable- forms." 

Some people have noted that Frum 
seems to be following in the footsteps of 
fellow conservative William F. Buckley 
Jr., who also began his career at the 
YDN. In 1951, Buckley wrote a book 
entitled God and Man at Yalt in which 
he criticized Yale for not inculcating its 
students with moral values. 

Like 
Frum, Buckley had just graduated 
from Yale (where he was an outspoken 
conservative) when the work appeared. 
Buckley is now the editor of the Na-
tional Rtvitw, which solicited Frum to 
write "A Memo to the Freshman 
Class " upon his graduation. 

At present, Frum is living in his 
native Toronto trying to support 
himself as a writer. He plans to do 
several book reviews for the National 
Review this fall. Frum also intends to 
write a book in the near future on 
Canadian politics, although he won't 
reveal any specific details about its 
contents.
