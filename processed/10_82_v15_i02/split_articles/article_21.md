Rachel Trowbridge in her youth 
From the one open window, a ruddy 
light would sometimes spill down into 
the night. The brown temple house 
would lie dark, hidden behind drawn 
blinds and a little iron fence, but 
through that single upper window you 
could see into a warm room with a fine 
old wood framed mirroron the far wall. 
Located right across the street from the 
President's house, 
it is the only 
building on Hillhouse Avenue without 
a Yale sign, without people bustling in 
and out. 
Number 46 Hillhouse was the last 
private residence on Hillhouse 
Avenue, the home of a woman known 
to everyone of consequence in New 
Haven, the last of her family line. 
Rachel Trowbridge, grande dame, Ed-
wardian, philanthropist, lived in that 
house for 76 years. Her life linked the 
genteel days of New Haven harbor's 
West Indies trade with the tense 
moments when the National Guard 
rolled in before May Day and a bomb 
went off in Ingalls Rink. 
She died six weeks ago at age 83. 
Trowbridge was close to six feet tall, a 
big-boned, absolutely erect woman with 
a round, pleasant face. Even in her 
later years, she still drove her middle-
aged Oldsmobile from meeting to 
meeting of her many charitable causes. 
Surrounded by Yale, she never had 
any official connection with it. Yet she 
was anything but a recluse. To the 
unofficial club of Yale administrators 
living on Hillhouse Avenue she was ac-
cording to former Secretary of the 
University, Henry Chauncey, Jr. "a 
part of the family"; to the New Haven 
community, she was akin to a patron 
saint. 


Though she leaves a handful of 
cousins, she was the last of the old New 
Haven Trowbridge family line. In 
1643, when New Haven was a planta-
tion town of 800 inhabitants, Thomas 
Trowbridge was already one of the 
city's dozen 
wealthiest citizens . 
Throughout the eighteenth and nine-
teenth centuries, the Trowbridge fami-
ly prospered in the West Indies trade, 
growing in wealth and numbers until 
Trowbridge mansions studded New 
H aven and several T rowbridge sea 
captains could arrive and depart from 
New Haven harbor in a single week. 
During the Revolution, captain 
Caleb Trowbridge, commanding the 
privateer Firebrand, captured a valuable 
British schooner and its cargo. Ezekiel 
Trowbridge's mansion on Temple 
Street's "Quality Row" became a haven 
for escaping slaves during the Civil 
War, and Thomas R . Trowbridge 
managed to forestall the draft in New 
Haven for a year after 1862 by offering 
bounties 
to encourage volunteers. 
Rachel Trowbridge's father, Ruther-
ford Trowbridge, was in the West In-
dies trade until1891. Philanthropy was 
a 
family 
tradition ; 
Hayes Q. 
Trowbridge, a Yale student when 
Rachel Trowbridge was born in 1899, 
once gave the New Haven Foundation 
a single gift of more than five million 
dollars. 
According to Betsy Cheney, an old 
friend, Trowbridge's mother had such 
an aristocratic presence that when 
she walked into a room, conversa-
tion would stop. It was natural that 
Trowbridge would be raised as a for-
mal, even austere Edwardian lady, 
although the R everend Andy Fidler of 
the Trinity C hurch on the Green 
ascribes that image more to her 
shyness and uneasiness with small talk 
than to any unusual reserve. 
Trained first at a private school in 
New Haven, in 1913 Trowbridge went 
to 
Westover 
School 
in 
Middle-
bury- then a new top-notch boarding 
school for girls, now a prestigious old 
one. 
Classmate Margie Clement 
described her as "quite a force in the 
class" and as a person who lived up to 
the school motto she translates as "to 
think, to do, to be."
