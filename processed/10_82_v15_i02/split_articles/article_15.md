And what did Possum expect? 
T.S Eliot knew to expect the flam-
boyant, the extravagant, the obsessive, 
the legendary, if not the practical, 
from Ezra Pound. As did William 
Butler Yeats. As did Jamesjoyce. As 
did e.e. cummings. As did the hun-
drecb of writers, readers and pub-
lishers who corresponded with 
Pound. Was it practical to write more 
than 50,000 pages of correspondence? 
Maybe, maybe not. But Ezra Pound 
was a prophet with many messages and 
missions; doing was essential, and for 
Pound, doing was writing. 

Nearly everything Pound wrote is 
now in a subterranean room in the 
Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript 
Library. There 50 ftle drawers hold 
roughly 50,400 pages of corres· 
pondence, more than 60,000 sheets of 
manuscript, and another 100,000 
pages of copies and documents. The 
archive contains all of Pound's pub-
lished·works; it also holcb a portion of 
his private library. Pound's own il-
lustrations for the Cantos hang on the 
wall. Scrapbooks compiled by Pound's


father fill more drawers. Several boxes 
hold the transcripts from Pound's 
broadcasts over Rome Radio during 
World War II; in the cabinet ·below 
them are the FBI ftles on Pound's in-
dictment for treason. 

The Library began negotiating to 
acquire Pound's papers in the early 
'60s. 
In 
1966 Pound's daughter 
deposited 15 trunks and wooden pack-
ing cases filled with her father's papers 
at the Beinecke, but curators could not 
open them because they were not 
Library property. 
For six 
years 
negotiations lagged, and the trunks 
remained shut. After Pound died in 
1972, the trustees of his estate were 
compelled to settle negotiations, and in 
1973 the Library purchased the ar-
chive with funds from an anonymous 
donation. On September 26 of that 
year it opened as the Center for the 
Study of Ezra Pound and his Contem-
poraries. Since then, the archive has 
been used by thousands of scholars 
from all over the world; it constitutes 
the source of a wealth of new criticism 
of Pound's poetry. 

The archive includes drawer after 
drawer of Pound's letters, each a sty-
lized, 
creative oeuvre. 
They are 
scrawled in his bold hand, or typed, 
riddled with phonetic spellings and 
punctuated haphazardly with diagonal 
slash-marks. Pound is familiar and 
playful in the letters. He salutes James 
Joyce as j/j/j Jayzus me daRRRiint," 
and he and T. S. Eliot address each 
other regularly as Rabbit and Possum. 
With a 
curious style that seems 
apropriate to this unorthodox poet, the 
letters express unabashed opinion in 
whacky, abstract metaphor. When he 
wants to rail to e.e. cummings about 
economic injustice in England, he 
writes:

In the middle of a letter to Eliot, 
Pound wrote this spontaneous verse: 

SONG FER TH MUSES GARDEN 
Ez Po und Possum 
Have picked all the blossum, 
Let all the othen 
Run back to their mothen 
Fer a

A boy's best friend is his Oedipus. 

Pound must have taken great 
pleasure in entertaining those to whom 
he wrote, but at the same time, he 
sought to instruct them in the writing 
and reading of literature. 
H e 
is 
generally acknowledged to be the in-
itiator of modem poetry; Ernest Hem-
ingway wrote, "Any poet born in this 
century who can honestly say that he 
has not been influenced by or learned 
"I leave out woldz that dont 
comport with wot l'ma drlvln 
at." 
greatly from the work of Ezra Pound 
deserves to be pitied rather than re-
buked." Pound believed 
literature 
should function as inspiration to 
originality and creativity in men's 
lives, but he perceived that a vagueness 
and imprecision in current writing was 
thwarting that purpose. The conse-
quence, he wrote, was that "The whole 
machinery of social and of individual 
thought and order goes to pot." 

Through his correspondence Pound 
schooled writers and readers in clear, 
precise, viJrorous writing. In a letter to 
"Rev. Mo/possum" [aka Eliot], Pound 
explained, "I leave out woidz that dont 
comport with wot rma drivin at ... 

Pound forged a new poetic mode to 
achieve exactitude in verse. In 1912 
Pound, writing in Paris, with H .D . 
and Richard Aldington, articulated the 
As a chi(d, Pound wrote to Santa Claus in "North Cloud/and, " requesting, 
among other things, «a whip and money for getting presents for other people. " 
three principles of his literature: direct 
treatment of subject, use only of essen-
tial words and new rhythm. In a letter 
to Iris Barry, one of the many young 
poets he had under his tutelage, Pound 
advised, 

In some of the •regular" stuff, you fall too 
flady into the •whakty whakty whakty whak-
ty whak' of the old pentameter. Pentameter 
O.K. if it is interesting, but al lot of linea 
with no variety won't do. 

The manuscripts in the archive show 
the development of Pound's new style 
of poetry by demonstrating the 
creative process. One can follow the 
working of an idea from note-form to 
its ultimate expression in published 
verse. To see what Pound r~jected, to 
follow the refining of images and lines, 
is to follow Pound, step by step, to his 
new poetic mode. 

Peter D'Epiro, in a doctoral disserta-
tion written at Yale, used the Pound 
archive to demonstrate how Pound 
created theM ala testa Cantos D'Epiro 
traces ideas trom their genesis in the 
poetry notebooks, through their ap-
pearance in intermediary drafts, final-
ly to their articulation in the published 
poem. Taking notes from a history 
book, Pound wrote in his notebook for 
Canto 8 these facts:

sun (eclipsed 
oscuro). 

After that appear some unrelated notes 
on the page, but lower, as if Pound 
were suddenly inspired by the informa-
tion he had scribbled, appear the lines: 

one year the river rose 
• 
• they fought in the snows 
one year the hail 
beat down the towers 
and trees. 

The idea is ultimately expressed at the 
opening of Canto 9: 

One year Ooods rose, 
One year they fought in the anowa 
One year hail fell, breaking the 
trees and walla. 

Pouncfs writing was by no means 
wholly literary. From the mid '20s on 
he was increasingly active in economic
