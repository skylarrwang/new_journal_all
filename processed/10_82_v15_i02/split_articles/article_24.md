"If you have to work here, you'll hate the building." book shelves which drain into garbage cans on the floor. A window from the viewing gallery down to the library has been blocked off to allow for more exhibition space, but noise from any gathering in the gallery reaches the library. "If you have to work here, you'll hate the building," said Lett. Secretary Maureen Florio noted that it intensified her moods. "If I'm in a good state of mind when I come in, I get happier. If I'm not, the building makes me feel worse," she said. A graduate student called the space she paints in "workable" but said engineering problems inside the building make work there inconvenient. "The light is good now, although it's strange that the lights are on constantly. I think that's poorly thought out," she said. 

Scully remembers that soon after the building's opening, critics complained that it didn't provide useful, functional, amply lit space to work in. "It surely doesn't do that," he said. 

Rudolph himself said, "Let's face it; modern architecture is about as functional as a Gothic cathedral." 

If the A.&A. has its practical drawbacks, what can be said about the building's aesthetic value? "You have to look at the period when it was built, read all the appreciations written about it, and see what the public was looking for at the time, which was monumentality and heroics," said Alexander Purves, director of undergraduate studies for the architecture school. "Twenty years later we find that a little hollow, as we're more concerned with the people who use our buildings now, but you have to make distinctions as to time frame, and consider who's criticizing from what point of view." In its early days the building received praise for its "spatial eloquence" and for being "a contrasting element in the anonymous townscape." 

"Some find it hostile; some, like me, find it sculpturally very exciting," said Purves "although the interior finishes of the walls done in concrete are very uncomfortable. I've skinned my hands on it more than once." Scully hates the material. a fluted concrete produced by hammering before it had dried. 

Rudolph himself was pleased with the paradox of the technique, saying, "It is relatively carefully built, but the handling of the surface renders it purposefully mud." Scully called the surface "revolting," and said it cost roughly ten times as much as smooth concrete such as that of Kahn's building, which he finds beautiful. 

A continuing challenge 
Scully senses a change in attitude toward the A.&A., saying, "I think the building has reached a nadir and will start to come back in appreciation. People will begin to appreciate the earnestness of its architectural attempt. In a later age they will not make so much fuss about its function. I suspect they'll find it a noble monument." Garvin, who called the building "lousy," tempered this by saying, "At least it tries to be a piece of architecture, something many recent structures do not do." 

Functionally, it appears that the building will not change significantly with the times. Jerald Stevens, vice president for finance and administration, admitted that lack of work space helps prevent the art school from bringing in additional students but Yale can't afford to let the school expand, Stevens said. Regarding the building itself, "The University has spent God-awful amounts of money to keep (it) alive and well, but it's inconceivable that anyone working there would deny that it has problems, because it does." He also voiced concern about safety at the A.&A., the scene of several crimes, but noted that its neighborhood seems to be improving. 

At the time of the A.&A.'s dedication, Rudolph voiced his belief that the prime responsibility of the teacher is to present his students with a provocative approach in order to arouse individual thinking. In its 20-year history, the Art and Architecture building has certainly provoked much change, praise and criticism. In the words of Scully, "It's a constant irritation and a challenge."
