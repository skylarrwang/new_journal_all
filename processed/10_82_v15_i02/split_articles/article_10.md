EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Polinsky's adam's apple 
To the Editor: 
We at the Yale Precision Marching 
Band, being a rather self-absorbed lot, 
very much enjoyed reading about 
ourselves in 
your recent issue. 
However, there are a number of points 
which we would like to clear up. 
1) As you are no doubt now aware, 
Mr. Richard Thurston is no longer 
faculty advisor for the band. Over the 
summer, he returned to his native 
Oklahoma soil. Our new resident deity 
and overlord is Mr. Tom Duffy, whom 
we are very pleased and proud to have 
with us. 
2) We wish to God that the media 
would get off the Dropping-The-Pants-
On-The-Field thing. We do not con-
sider it an example of the offensiveness 
we are trying to avoid. All band 
members were wearing diapers 
underneath, revealing much less than 
the cheerleaders one sees prancing 
about on the television during profes-
sional games. Frankly, we still think 
the idea was a tremendous giggle. The_ 
only reason we won't do it again is that 
"it's been done." 
3) Between the time of your inter-
view with David Polinsky and the 
publication of the article, his Adam's 
apple, which your writer reported was 
the size of a fist, seems to have fallen 
off. We have examined Mr. Polinsky's 
throat and found it to be absolutely 
smooth (if it's shaved). Obviously he's 
lost his Adam's apple. Have you seen it 
lying about anywhere? 
Your~ inquiringly, 
Peter Schmitz 
Announcer for the YPMB


Russo out of touch 
John Russo's address to the class of '82 
("Perils of the Middle Path," TNJ, 
September 10, 1982) says more about 
the speaker than about anything else. 
Russo says: "We cannot allow our large 
bureaucratic organizations, both 
public and private, to render us per-
sonally irrelevant without hope." 
Russo's approach is out of touch. He 
is . forced into fabricating large cor-
porate dragons to slay, simply to have 
something to slay. 
He imagines 
economic 
demons 
that limit our 
freedom without us knowing it. It is 
always easier to attack something no 
one can see, something no one knows 
about; no one can argue with you. 
The truth of the matter is students 
have not lost their idealism to some 
capitalistic boogeyman. 
They 
have 
discovered that people like John Russo 
have no constructive solutions to offer, 
only romantic notions of"changing the 
system." People have discovered that 
idealism must be tempered by some 
sense of the real and conflicting 
demands made on society. Or, to use 
Russo's langugage, if you can't drink 
pure artesian spring water, then you 
hc{ve to make do with Coke. 
I suspect Russo is insincere. He 
doesn't really want to change anything. 
Without some oppressive, yet con-
veniently anonymous corporation to 
attack, Russo would have nothing to 
shake his sword at. Indeed, he himself 
would be exposed as "personally irrele-
vant."
