**Title: Reveille on the Old Campus**
**Author: David Sleeper**
**Page number(s): 3-5**

In the Fall of 1943, a large duck hawk built its nest among the gargoyles on top of Harkness Tower. From its perch it could see the bomb spotter's catwalk on the roof of Sterling Memorial Library, the armed sentries who guarded the entrances to the Old Campus, and the clouds of dust raised by marching soldiers dressed in green, tan, and blue uniforms. In 1943, towering elm trees lined the streets with geometric precision and every blade of grass had been battered down by thousands of marching feet. Loudspeakers strung between the two courts of Berkeley College called trainees to formation on the Cross Campus. 

Some of the 7,000 military personnel stationed at Yale thought the big bird living atop Harkness Tower was a vulture. Every time the bugle sounded for a meal, the hawk would swoop down and pick off a pigeon from the Old Campus or the New Haven Green. After returning to its perch, it would rain down pieces of pigeon on unsuspecting passers-by. 
Yale had been signed over to the War Department for the duration, and it would emerge from the Second World War a changed institution. 

The path of true neutrality is not an easy one and sacrifices will be demanded every step of the way. Yet any sacrifice can be endured which prevents the supreme one, the slaughter of men, women, and children. 
-Editorial in the Yale Daily News Sept. 25,1939

In the minds of most Yale students, isolationism represented the only way America could keep its sanity in a world being torn apart by insane forces. Kingman Brewster, Chairman of the 1940 News, joined the America First movement, and testified before a Congressional subcommittee against America's policy of providing aid to Britain. "We were trying to save the world," Brewster said, "not just Yale." On Dec. 7, 1941, a quiet Sunday during reading period, the number of isolationists on campus sank to zero. 

The news of the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor shocked students into an immediate orientation towards war. On the evening of December 7, Elias Clarke (present master of Silliman College) and other members of the News staff brought the Yale Marching Band to the Old Campus and gathered a crowd of over a thousand students. They moved onto Elm Street singing "The Star Spangled Banner" and shouting "On To Tokyo." They then swarmed up Hillhouse Avenue and stopped in front of University President Charles Seymour's house, waiting nervously for him to offer some kind of direction. Seymour responded by delivering a stirring speech. "This is not the first time in American History," he said, "that Yalemen have gathered together to express their loyalty to the nation." The crowd cheered, sang "He's a Jolly Good Fellow" and "Bright College Years," and then marched into the lobby of the Taft Hotel chanting "To Hell With Hirohito." 

During the first year of the Second World War the government counseled students to help the war effort by staying in college and getting a thorough education. As hostilities intensified, and more and more students faced the possibility of service overseas, the popularity of geography and foreign language studies took a quantum leap upward. In the minds of many, technology more than manpower would win the war-so the disciplines of math and science became absolutely essential. This feeling was amplified six months after Pearl Harbor when over a thousand Yale graduates wrote the college saying that their greatest mistake as students had been not to take enough math. In other efforts to get behind the war, the News sponsored special broadcasts of International Morse Code classes, and others volunteered for bomb warden duty on the New Haven coastline. 

But as the war escalated overseas, an increasing number of students left college to enlist. 
"I can't remember one person," said Elias Clarke '43, "who tried to avoid service. In fact, there were a great many students who went to great lengths to enlist-to the point of hiding heart murmurs and athletic injuries." Members of the Yale faculty followed right on the heels of their departing students. Many went to Washington, got back their former commissions, and worked for the O.S.S. In a short time it appeared as if only those too young for service and the "lame and the halt" would be left on campus. 

Faced with a possible shutdown of facilities due to the dwindling student population, the Administration turned to the War Department for a solution. The government had already begun leasing buildings at colleges for specialized training activities -a practice which would involve over 200 colleges and 100,000 trainees before the war's end. President Seymour, in an effort to support the war effort and simultaneously generate needed income for Yale, virtually signed away the campus.
