Haven and moved onto the Old 
Campus. By summer, the Navy had 
sent 1800 more trainees, and quar-
tered them in Branford, Davenport, 
Pierson, and Saybrook Colleges. The 
Army Specialized Training Corps 
(AST)soonfollowed. In June, 1944, 
at the height of Yale's military occu-
pation, 7,328 military personnel were 
stationed on campus. Charles Rum-
ford Walker, the Asst. Secretary of 
the University, estimated that it cost 
an officer eighty-nine salutes to pass 
the Sterling Memorial Library at 
noon-day. 


Ostensibly, the military programs 
remained separate and distinct 
from Yale's education policies- the 
War Department had simply leased 
the university's facilities. But a sub-
stantial number of Yale undergrad-
uates enrolled in the military pro-
grams, and their experience as 
soldiers at Yale-and Yale's experi-
ence as a military camp- would lead 
to permanent changes in the postwar 
era. 


The military wanted specialists-
doctors, engineers, chaplains, inter-
preters-and it wanted them fast. 
Soldiers were paid $50 a month to "go 
to college" and learn pre-medical, 
engineering, and language skills. The 
military's emphasis on producing 
specialists led to a devaluation of 
most liberal arts courses. A typical 
Navy program required its trainees to 
take math, English, American 
History, science, and a course on 
naval organization ("How to tell a 
cop from an admiral," wrote Charles 
Rumford Walker). The Navy did, 
however, allow its students to major 
in the Humanities if they satisfied all 
the other requirements. The Army 
students took twed'ty-four class 
hours a week, and spent twice as 
much time in math and science as 
they did in the liberal arts. 


Many of the Army trainees 
selected to attend Yale were woefully 
unprepared for college level instruc-
tion. The president of another college 
remarked that his AST boys were 
"splendid-fine physical specimens, 
of good moral character, and high 
native intelligence. The only criticism 
my faculty has to make is that they 
cannot read, write, add, subtract, 
multiply, or divide.'' This fact, com-
bined with the military's policy of 
getting its trainees out into the field 
of combat as soon as possible, led to 
notorious "refresher" courses and 
accelerated programs of stud~ One 
apocryphal story involved an Army 
trainee at Yale who looked out the 
window during a mathematics re-
fresher course; when he looked back, 
he found he had mi•aed trigonometry. 


Certain members of theY ale 
faculty fell right into the military 
routine. Emerson Tuttle, the Master 
of Davenport, became a regular ty-
rant when theN avy men moved into 
his college. Every night he would 
line the men up in the courtyard and 
review the troops. 


An article in a newspaper pub-
lished by theY ale Army-Air Corps 
cadets referred to the Payne Whitney 
Gym as the "Temple of Sweat." 
Robert J .H. Kiphuth and his staff at 
Payne Whitney worked closely with 
the military. Mandatory physical 
fitness programs brought as many as 
1,000 trainees every hour to the 
gym for survival training, obstacle 
courses, body building classes, self-
defense training, and swimming prac-
tice. Kiphuth, who had always been a 
physical fitness advocate, enjoyed 
working with students eager to fulfill 
the fitness requirements -a cadet 
always had the nagging feeling in the 
back of his mind that he might profit 
from the training if he ever got into 
actual combat. So they gritted their 
teeth, ran up and down the stairways 
in the gymnasium tower, took as-
sorted "bruhah-ha" tests, and ran 
laps around the Grove Street 
Cemetery. "Bob Kiphuth," an article 
in the American Mercury said, "is 
building muscles for victory over 
Hitler, not Harvard." 


Other members of the faculty dis-
agreed sharply with military policies. 
George W. Pierson, University His-
torian and an Associate Professor of 
History during the war, objected to 
the "jettisoning" of the liberal 
arts curriculum in favor of more 
technical training. "We felt be-
trayed," said Pierson. " Some faculty 
members thought that we should 
train a soldier's mind and morale, 
not just his computer.' • Pierson and 
three other junior faculty members 
-
Maynard Mack, Thomas Menden· 
hall, and Richard Sewall -
would 
meet secretly in the Sterling Library 
and discuss possible actions to save 
the beleaguered Humanities. Pier-
son's " Young Turk" movement suc-
ceeded only in bringing the junior fa-
culty's discontent to the attention of 
the Administration. The military's 
policy did not change. "It taught me 
how helpless a major university can 
be," said Pierson, "when dealing 
with the government on issues that 
can't be given an obvious emotional 
value."

The mobilization of Yale and its 
facilities by the military was total-
almost nothing remained of the pre-
war college life style. Connecticut 
Hall became the Air Corps Dispen-
sary. No one ("not even if you were 
President Seymour") could enter the 
Old Campus without a pass. Heeling 
for the Lit, Dramat, and the News 
became a nostalgic memory. The 
Briton Hadden building, which 
formerly housed the News, was 
turned into the Navy V12 head-
quarters. The Army command took 
over DKE House. A rigid military 
schedule structured the lives of the 
trainees: reveille blew at 6:40; 
classes, exercise sessions, and 
marching practice filled the day; 
evening study hours restricted stu-
dents to their rooms; and the lights 
went out at 10:30. 


Trainees found numerous ways to 
circumvent military restrictions. 
They quickly discovered that the 
lights in the basements and steam 
tunnels operated on city power, and 
were not shut off at taps. "We would 
sneak down to the basement and play 
squash all night long,' • said John 
O'Connell, '45W, a member of the 
Navy program stationed in Daven-
port. Fred Rose, '44E, present Chair-
man of the A Y A, tells of a poker 
game late one night in a J .E. tunnel. 
It was during the summer term and a 
poker player who had run out of 
funds decided to put up an extremely 
rare item -
a direct current electric 
fan. After several raises the fan's 
worth was estimated at more than 
$100. "I won the fan," Rose said, 
"and might add that the proposed 
summer term should not be viewed 
with so much horror." 


Dr. Griswold of the Dept. of 
University Health acted as a one 
man anti-service brigade. Students 
who skipped a class or formation 
reported that the doctor never failed 
to provide them with a needed 
medical excuse. 


Not all trainees successfully 
bucked military regulations. One 
weekend, three quarters of the men 
in Branford College had their Satur-
day afternoon liberty cancelled for 
failing a white glove inspection. 


The tremendous influx of military 
personnel resulted in a severe 
housing shortage. Six to nine stu-
dents were assigned to rooms that 
hold four people today. Each trainee 
was allotted half a desk. The dining 
halls forever abolished the practice of 
il
