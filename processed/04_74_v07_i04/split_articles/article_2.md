Last December, I was taken totally by surprise when the phone rang and a voice said, "John, this is B.F. Skinner calling to wish you a happy 21st birthday." My roommates-knowing how much I admired his work-had asked Skinner to call, and he had cheerfully agreed. On the phone, Skinner offered to discuss psychology with me at a later date. I held him to his offer, and traveled to Cambridge where we talked for almost an hour. What follows is a personal reflection on Skinner-the man, and his work. 

Burrhus Frederick Skinner, age 70, will retire from the Harvard faculty this summer, a man whose intentions have been thoroughly misunderstood. His theory of human behavior poses a radical challenge to the way most people like to think about themselves. Skinner believes that all behavior is solely a product of the interaction between an individual's genetic endowment and environmental experiences; he denies man's autonomous control of his own actions. Man's behavior - like that of a rat or a pigeon in a Skinner box - is no more than a series of sophisticated bar presses. By applying the scientific method to himself, man finds that he too, like the heavenly bodies, a falling apple, or a Mack truck, behaves according to discernible laws. Those who accept his theories consider Skinner a Newton among 20th century psychologists. 

Of course, not everyone accepts his ideas. In fact, almost no one does. Skinner estimates that 80 per cent of the comment on his work is unfavorable. Critics tend to focus on the implications of his theory that deal with the control of human behavior. Either directly or by innuendo, Skinner is compared to totalitarian figures - the Orwellian prototypes for Big Brother - or the immoral scientist who shows Big Brother how it can all be done. 

No image could be further from the one Skinner projects as a man. Meeting him is a disarming experience. A short man, he wears thick black-rimmed glasses. His face belies his age; his skin is smooth, almost youthful, though sagging somewhat at the jowls. 

Although he has done no laboratory research in years, he shares a floor in William James Hall with several dozen pigeons noticeable because of their smell and incessant cooing. His office is simple. Boxes of books and papers lie open on the vinyl floor. There is a desk, some bookcases, a few chairs, and a color photograph of his granddaughter. 
Still it is recognizably Skinner's office. Copies of his works, bound in black and gold volumes, stand prominently on his desk between bookends. On the wall hangs a painting of a man's body with a duck's head, sitting atop a huge, partially cracked egg. The Saturday Review used the painting as a cover to go with an article Skinner wrote on the artist and society. In the article Skinner had characterized an artist as no more than a warm body within which creativity occurs. "They made me pay for the painting," Skinner told me, standing by the brooding figure on the egg, "but I thought it went nicely with the theme of the article."
