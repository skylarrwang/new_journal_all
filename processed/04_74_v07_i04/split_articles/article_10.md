**Yale's Endowment: Eccentricities**
**Page number(s): 10-11**

Volume seven, number four I April22, 1974 110 
funds- that patchwork of the senti-
mental and the superfluous-now 
total nearly twice the unrestricted 
endowment. And though University 
officials may wish those restricted 
funds could be tapped for genew 
use, even the eccentricities add some-
thing. Their frills lend a flavor to the 
place. 
Would Yale be the same without 
its daffodils? Each spring they 
bloom with the help of sun, soil, and 
the Barbara Foster Vietor Memorial 
Planting Fund, established in 1966 
by the Vietor family and the Acorn 
Foundation. 
Would the library be complete 
without its authoritative six-volume 
critical edition of Bracton's 
Tractatus de Legibus et Consuetu-
dinibus Angliae-the most impor-
tant legal work of the Middle Ages? 
John E. Parsons, 1851, left $5,000 for 
its publication. 
Nor need we starve for sea adven-
ture. The friends of Arthur Sturges 
Hildebrand, who was lost at sea 
while sailing from Greenland to 
Labrador in 1924, have endowed the 
purchase of "books on adventure by 
sea and other kindred subjects." 
Were it not for the 1909 Sunday 
Opening Fund, Yale's museums and 
galleries would be closed on 
Sundays. Graduation, too, would be 
different without the Jerome B. 
Lucke Commencement Attendance 
Fund, which each year brings the 
four oldest living graduates to Yale 
on commencement day. 
And where would we be without 
the Mrs. Hepsa Ely Silliman Memo-
rial Lectures, which "illustrate the 
presence and wisdom of God as man-
ifested in the Natural and Moral 
World"? 
Certainly Yale ~ould survive with-
out these unique gifts, and the other 
curious contributions its alumni con· 
tinue to bestow-2,000 bushels of 
soybeans, for example, or two polo 
ponies, a yacht, a summer cottage. 
It could surely have done without 50 
prize cattle that had to be fed 
Contact 
thi-ough a Midwestern winter, 
costing the University more than the 
herd eventually brought at auction. 
But deprived of the eccentricities 
these funds scatter about the Col-
lege, Yale would be a more prosaic 
place. Only a tradition of gifts that 
assures quality in even the most 
obscure comers of the University 
could breed myths like the Straw-
berry Shortcake Fund and the 
F. Wells Hodges elephant 
scholarship. 
• 'The strawberry shortcake in the 
dining halls used to be so good," 
says George D. Vaill, Assistant 
Secretary of the University, "that 
everyone decided it must be an 
endowment.'' Undergraduates now 
hear of endowments for salad, 
cheesecake and ice cream. But when 
officials in the dining halls and the 
Treasurer's office learned of these 
windfalls, they all replied with 
amused regret, "No such thing." 
The same answer awaited a group 
of ladies in Darien, Conn. when they 
inquired about the F. Wells Hodges 
Scholarship, which was to be 
"awarded to any student in the 
University who shall possess an 
elephant of good character and 
unquestioned need, with qualities of 
leadership, outstanding ability, and 
future usefulness." Darien had just 
received a baby elephant from its 
civic pen-pal-Mecara, India -and 
the ladies wanted to know if all of 
Darien's boys would now be eligible 
for Yale scholarships. 
After a most careful investigation, 
the admissions office found that the 
scholarship was an inner-office spoof 
of Yale's other, more legitimate 
endowments. They notified Darien 
that there were no funds for such a 
Undaunted, the ladies of Darien 
quickly mailed in their response, 
payable to the F. Wells Hodges 
account: five quarters, eight dimes, 
eight nickels, 23 pennies, one British 
shilling, one New York City subway 
token, and five green stamps: 0
