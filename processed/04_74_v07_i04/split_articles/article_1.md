A panel on "Watergate and the Media," which met at Yale on April 1, discussed the issue of the individual's right to a fair trial versus the society's right to a free press. 
The majority of the panel (Eliot Richardson, Anthony Lewis, Daniel Schorr, ~d Seymour Hersh) agreed that in the early stages of the Watergate affair the press overstepped its normal bounds. Its investigations and revelations may have infringed on the rights of some individuals to a fair trial. 

Schorr spoke eloquently of a breakdown in our system of justice at the highest level. With the Government incapable of checking its own criminal abuses, the press took on an extraordinarily dangerous, yet necessary role. But now, Schorr said, the press is returning to the exercise of proper restraint. The Special Prosecutor is at work. Numerous indictments have been handed down. Trials are in progress. The House Judiciary Committee is investigating impeachment of the President. The system is working again, and the individual's right to a fair trial should again reign. 

Who can disagree? Who would condone violation by the press of the secrecy of grand jury proceedings? Being for a fair trial is like being against murder. But dQ all the safeguards and elaborate procedures designed to protect the person accused of a crime apply to the President during the process of impeachment? 
I say the answer is no. Impeachment proceedings do bear a superficial resemblance to ordinary criminal trials. The House of Representatives is akin to a grand jury bringing an indictment. The Senate is akin to judge and jury deciding on acquittal or conviction. The managers appointed by the House are like prosecutors appearing before the Senate. The accused, called "the respondent," has the right to counsel, to cross-examine, and to call witnesses. 

But impeachment proceedings are political, not legal. They are designed to deal with a political failure in the system. It is for the House to decide if there is sufficient evidence of "treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors," and for the Senate to decide by a two-thirds vote on removal and disqualification for future office. 

An individual accused of a crime has the right to challenge evidence, to seek postponement, a change of venue, disqualification of jurors, and to seek a reversal of conviction in a higher court. We should cherish the individual's right not to be deprived of life, freedom, or property without due process. We gladly prefer that some who are guilty may go free rather than increase the chances of convicting the innocent. 

But an individual does not have the same right to hold the office of the Presidency as he does to remain out of jail until proven guilty. I would even argue that a President under investigation for impeachment cannot invoke the spirit of the Fifth Amendment against self-incrim.i,nation. 

A person who accepts the Presidency must acknowledge the political power of Congress to conduct a full investigation when impeachment is the issue. A President qua President cannot be granted the protections we accord to individuals. 
His protection as President lies ultimately in his own integrity, his respect for the truth - in full disclosure - and in the faith that Congress will recognize truth and integrity where such .exist. 0
