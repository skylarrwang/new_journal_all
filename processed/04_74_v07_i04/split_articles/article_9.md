Dollars and Daffodils 
by Dan Denton 
One by one Yale's grand old tradi-
tions fall victim to the times. In the 
last decade alone we have seen the 
end of neckties at dinner, the slow 
death of the fraternities, and coedu-
cation charging through the door of 
Mory's. Yet one important tradition 
will survive no matter what changes 
mold the new landscape of the 
University -
Mother Yale will con-
tinue to call on her wealthy progeny 
for financial support. 

And generations of Yale children 
will no doubt continue to respond, 
both with the unrestricted funds 
called for by the current $370 million 
capital fund drive, and with more 
specific personalized grants for buil-
dings, awards, collections, and who 
knows, maybe even an elephant 
scholarship. 

''The endowment is a superb act of 
faith," wrote Amos P. Wilder, '84, 
during the $20 million Endowment 
Fund Campaign in 1926. "It is not a 
call for money; it is a challenge to 
ordinary men to be great." But 
somewhere in the long tradition of 
alw:n.ni giving, some of those wealthy 
progeny got the idea that a gift to 
Yale could be an opportunity to leave 
a personal stamp on the University. 
Some, like the Sterlings and the 
Beineckes, donated useful buildings, 
but a good number let their imagina-
tions run away with their check-
books. When alumni givers ex-
press themselves through curious 
collections and lecture series, ancient 
books and daffodils, they leave 
memorable-if often obscure-
contributions to the diversity of 
Yale. For proof, we need only look at 
Yale's roster of rococo endowments. 

To David C. DeForest, a finerY ale 
meant a Yale with more DeForests. 
In 1823, he established an annual 
gift of $1,000 in memory of his 
mother, Mrs. Mehitabel Lockwood. 
The scholarship was to be given to 
her direct male descendants, or to 
any other DeForests at Yale. If, how-
ever, no such candidates existed, the 
sum was to be "applied to the 
education of young men in indigent 
circumstances and of good talents, 
who are willing to assume the name 
of DeForest." 

Othniel C. Marsh had a different 
idea. When he died in 1899, Marsh 
leftY ale $30,000 to be used "in pub-
lishing the results of his explorations 
in the West." Marsh also bequeathed 
his house on Prospect Street, to be 
used as the University Botanical 
Garden "a.nd for no other purpose." 
The University scrupulously com-
plied with Marsh's requests, as it has 
even with the bizarre will of the late 
Col. John Trumbull. Trumbull left 
his vast art collection to Yale-with 
two provisos. First, that Yale build 
the first university art gallery in the 
nation to house it; second, that when 
the gallery was completed Yale 
exhume Trumbull's remains and 
place them in a vault in the basement 
beneath the paintings. If Yale ever 
reneged, both the colonel and his art 
would go to Harvard. But Yale has 
kept the collection by keeping 
Trumbull's trust, taking his remains 
wherever his paintings go, and-
when the collection is not on 
display-carefully stacking the 
paintings in the basement above the 
colonel's grave. 

In the 1700's, while Yale struggled 
to stand on its own, dollDrs attached 
no such strings to their gifts. Every 
pound of sterling helped pay for the 
project at hand. Thus Yale's first 
fund drive, conducted in 1721 by 
Gurdon Saltonstall, Esq., financed 
the building no college could be 
without-the rector's house. And 
when the primal Eli-Elihu Yale-
sent his silver, he placed no restric-
tions on its use. Unfortunately, his 
gifts suffered other limitations. 
" Mr. Yale sends you by this 
Ship," wrote Jeremy Dummer, the 
College's London agent, "one 
hundred pounds Sterling ... ! am glad 
to get what I can of him, tho it be 
less than his engagements; for he 
promised me that he would send you 
over 200 Pounds per anno as long as 
he lived, & make a settlement upon 
you forever, to commence immedi-
ately after his death. But I am afraid 
lest being old he should dye & 
neglect it." 

But once these early bequests had
established the skeleton of Yale 
College, the school could no longer 
justify funneling all donations into a 
single project. The initial urgency 
had passed. Yale would survive. For 
the fleshing out of that skeleton, the 
University would depend more on 
on the fetishes and fancies of its 
affluent sons. 

To the distress of Yale's fund-
raisers, the alumni gift became a 
mode of self-expression. Timothy 
Dwight, President of Yale in 1888, 
sought to discourage this trend when 
he told the alumni, "The main object 
is the special want of an increase in 
the General Fund of the University 
as a whole." Despite President 
Dwight's plea, the trend toward 
special grants has continued even to 
the present day, according to John 
Ecklund, the current University 
Treasurer. ''When someone decides 
to contribute," says Ecklund, " we 
try to convince them that a gift unre-
stricted in its potential uses is best 
for Yale." 

One fundraising tactic designed to 
untie the strings from endowments 
has been to de-emphasize the 
alumnus's memory of his particular 
experience at Yale, pushing instead 
a composite image of Youth at Yale. 
If the fundraiser can plant the 
memory of an immortal education 
bound neither by time nor special 
conditions, then the resulting gift 
should be just as limitless. This 
strategy is best illustrated by the 
grandiloquent Amos P. Wilder. 

" Yale men hear the rustle of 
wings," Wilder said, referring to the 
memory of " those plastic years when 
mind and heart quivered under first 
revelation of truth and glimpses 
down corridors of aspiration and 
beauty." 

''The son of Yale,'' he continued, 
"has his eyes fixed on a composite 
teacher who is all wisdom; on a Yale 
boy who is all that a generous, high-
spirited, noble-minded youth should 
be; on an immortal Yale." 

Nevertheless, the restricted
