personal catering -
long food lines 
and metal trays replaced the obedi-
ent waiters and menus of the pre-war 
days. 

Friction between trainees in dif-
ferent service branches was common. 
On one occasion members of the 
Army-Air Corps living in Wright 
Hall called across High St. to the 
Navy men in Saybrook, "When I 
was a teeny-tiny little boy my mom· 
ma dressed me up in a nice sailor 
suit too." A barrage of coke bottles 
from Saybrook followed, shattering 
windows on the Old Campus. Navy 
men, who woke up a half hour be-
fore everybody else, would slap 
their feet loudly on the pavement as 
they marched by the sleeping Army 
men in the Law School. 

Army trainees were not allowed to 
play on Yale Varsity teams, but they 
did participate vigorously in intra-
muralsports programs. Calhoun 
College boasted that its tackle foot-
ball team could "wipe up the Bowl" 
with the Yale Varsity. Calhoun's 
first string had former players from 
Michigan, Ohio State, Washington, 
and Notre Dame. 

Town-Gown squabbles enjoyed a 
moratorium during the war years. 
Indeed, New Haven residents idol-
ized the soldiers stationed on the 
Yale Campus. Every morning, a col· 
or guard from Yale would march 
down to theN ew Haven Green and 
raise the flag. Parades and full dress 
retreats held on the Green (accom-
panied by the music of Glenn 
Miller's band) attracted thousands 
of civilian spectators. 

Perhaps no group on campus suf· 
fered more than the handful of 
civilian students. These students 
had to live with accelerated course 
schedules (an entire Yale education 
was squeezed into 2 yrs. 8 mo.), sum· 
mer terms, early morning bugles, 
and thousands of soldiers marching 
to the loud strains of" Allouette" 
and "The Air Force Song." The turn-
over rate for civilians, many of 
whom were under draft age, was 
fantastic. The few civilian law stu-
dents had to listen to their lectures 
over the roar of full sized airplane 
engines, bolted to the Law School 
floor for an Air Corps class. Civilian 
students were stigmatized as "mis-
fits." The devastating psychological 
impact of being a civilian on a mili-
tary campus led to numerous ner-
vous breakdowns -
many more than 
during peacetime. 

I uiew the war years as one of the 
great watersheds in recent Yale 
memory. 

The turmoil of the Second World 
War caused a breakdown of rigid 
social patterns. In an effort to con· 
form to the nation's urgent need to 
win the war, Yalesteppedoutofits 
ivy-covered suit of armor. The 
smooth transition from an institu-
tion of higher learning to a 7,000 
man military camp, and then back 
again after the war, showed Yale's 
flexibility. 

The war left behind many concrete 
changes. Half year courses were first 
introduced; the college system be-
came stronger; the number of credits 
needed to graduate decreased; self-
service replaced the waiters and 
menus in the dining halls; and an ex-
cellent language and foreign area 
studies curriculum came into being. 

The influx of students to Yale during 
the war from every state in the 
Union and varied social backgrounds 
augured Inky Clark's revolution in 
admissions policies which would oc-
cur in the sixties. And the hot 
weather of the summer terms cast 
the first shadows of doubt on the in-
violability of the jacket and tie dress 
code. 

The war years taught one bitter 
lesson. The all-out effort to win 
the war nearly resulted in a perma· 
nent weakening of the Liberal Arts 
curriculum at Yale. The military's 
demand for more and more technical 
experts came very close to making 
the Humanities a war casualty. His-
tory repeated itself in the fifties 
following the Sputnik scare. Govern-
ment grants earmarked for the sci-
ences once again shifted educational 
emphases and threatened the excel-
lence of Yale's Humanities. 

Yale insisted, though, on graduat-
ing Renaissance men rather than 
specialists. The secret wartime meet· 
ings in Sterling Library by four 
members of the junior faculty helped 
maintain this tradition. The staunch 
defense of a liberal education shown 
by George Pierson, Thomas 
Mendenhall, Maynard Mack, and 
Richard Sewall was perhaps the 
war's most valuable legacy. 0

"How am I doing, wonder?" 
Reflections on Louis Kahn 
by Richard Weinstein and Charles Moore 
Louis Isadore Kahn was born in 1901 
on the Baltic island of Osel, Estonia. 
When he was four years old, his fami-
ly emigrated to the United States, 
settling in Philadelphia. There Kahn 
attended school, displaying talent in 
music and painting. After refusing 
several art scholarships, he entered 
the School of Architecture at the 
University of Pennsylvania. 
Trained in the classical Beau:x: 
Arts tradition, Kahn received what 
he later called an "introduction 
to the spirit of architecture." He 
learned little of the modernistic

movements during his years at 
Penn; he developed, instead, an af-
fection for the balanced geometric 
masses of Greek and Roman 
antiquity. 
Kahn graduated from Penn in 
1924. During the next ten years, he 
began independent practice. His first 
commission was the Akavath Israel 
Synagogue in Philadelphia, the city 
where he did most of his early work. 
Only much later, at the age of 52, did· 
Kahn design what critics consider 
the first strong statement of his ap-
proach-the Yale Art Gallery. After 
that, professional recognition and 
more commissions came easily. 
Among his later projects are: 
Rickards Medical Laboratories at 
Penn (1960); the Salk Institute, La 
Jolla, Cal. (1965); New Haven's Hill 
Central urban renewal project 
(1967); the second capital at Dacca, 
East Pakistan, now capital of 
Bangladesh; Kimbell Art Museum in 
Fort Worth, Texas (1972); the new 
library at Phillips Exeter Academy 
in Exeter, N.H. (1972); and the Yale 
Center for British Art and British 
Studies, still under construction. 
Kahn taught for most of his life. 
He was a professor of architecture at 
Yale from 1947-57, and lectured here 
frequently even after he returned to 
Penn, this time as a teacher. He 
spent one year ( 1950-51) as resident 
architect at the American Academy 
in Rome. In 1960, he was a visiting 
lecturer at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, 
and several other universities. 
Vincent Scully calls Kahn "the 
most effective teacher of his time in 
America. His ideas influenced 
Romaldo Giurgola, Richard Wein-
stein, Robert Venturi, and Charles 
Moore. "He liberated them from the 
outworn architectural models and 
restrictive patterns of thought of the 
fifties," says Scully. "He set them 
free to think through the whole prob· 
lem of architectural form and 
program from the beginning. " 
On Sunday evening, March 17, 
Kahn was returning from India, 
where he had been working on ~ne of

ner and then relax at the local bar for 
some talk, sometimes too much for 
the hour, and then be back with Lou 
at the board, drawing and drawing 
and drawing until you looked up in 
the quiet before dawn to find he had 
fallen asleep while working, his cheek 
upon a smudgy sketch and the char-
coal still in his hand. 
Louis Kahn was single-minded 
and passionately serious about archi-
tecture. In it he found a meaning so 
broad and humane that his entire 
experience of literature, music, pain-
ting, science, or people could be 
turned to the purpose of making 
buildings, or else consumed by his 
own architectural imagination. He 
made a heroic effort to be intel-
lectually rigorous about the realm of 
feeling and value, developing a new 
language to work out his thoughts. 
He forged ideas in a dialogue that 
was really with himself but was also 
mediated through conversations 
with his students, his colleagues, like 
Robert L. Ricolais, the remarkable 
engineer and teacher, or anyone who 
would listen. During these discus· 
1 sions he spoke in a metaphysical 
tongue, casting the spell that 
allowed him to pursue the substance 
--.. . . of a thought or feeling relentlessly 
his projects-the Institute of Man· 
agement in Ahmedabad. He col· 
lapsed and died in Pennsylvania 
Station, apparently of a heart attack. 
He was 73. 
Form comes from wonder. Wonder 
stems from our "in touchness" with 
how we were made. One senses that 
nature records the process of what it 
makes, so that in what it makes 
there is also the record of how it was 
made. In touch with this record we 
are in wonder. This wonder gives rise 
to knowledge. But knowledge is 
related to other knowledge and this 
relation gives a sense of order, a 
sense of how they inter-relate in a 
harmony that makes all things exist. 
From knowledge to sense of order we 
then wink at wonder and say "How 
am I doing, wonder?" 
Louis Kahn 
Louis Kahn's office was furnished 
with a concrete bench, a brass tele-
scope, and a complete set of the 
Arabian Nights in Burton's transla-
tion. I remember a large sack of 
walnuts and a wooden mallet in the 
comer. Old folios and huge architec-
tural books lay on his desk. The 
place was simple and friendly, the 
drafting room outside was silent and 
rumpled looking; it impressed one as 
a place of work and serious effort -
which it was, day after day and 
frequently all through the night. We 
would work in the office through din-
until it was caught, examined, 
worried over -
until its meaning for 
him was exhausted. With the splen· 
did passion of the Talmudic scholar, 
his mind was sublime in concentra· 
tion through the torture and exalta-
tion of the argument, but rigorous 
and careful to preserve integrity of 
spirit and liveliness of feeling. He 
loved to talk and dispute, until some-
times late at night we would have to 
manage and cajole him back to the 
drafting room under the threat of an 
impending deadline. After class a 
. conversation might also continue, 
and usually did without any sense of 
boundary or limit. 
He was an unimposing figure, 
slight, with a scarred face. Lou 
was channing and full of warmth and 
sly wit, at times relentless, self-
centered, and repetitive (though 
always useful and alive to his inner 
purpose). At these latter times you 
felt isolated by the spectacle of his 
obsessive passion -
indifferent and 
cruel and chilling, in the way it 
separated him from everybody else. 
To us it seemed that he was never 
home; he lived in the office, in the 
circle of conversation, in the homes 
of students and friends. He enjoyed 
being charming to women who were 
drawn to his blithe anecdotes and a 
watchful blue-eyed gaze touched 
with insolence. He used to drink 
Plymouth gin neat and without ice. 
The first time I met Lou was in the 
comforting courtyard of the museum 
at the University of Pennsylvania. It 
was a reception for new students and
