Reinforcement for a 
Skinner &eak 
(continued from page 2) 
We talked about the weather- he 
hadn't much liked the cold March in 
Cambridge. He told me about his 
impending'tetirement a.nd his poor 
eyesight. His depth perception is 
particularly bad. He carries a cane to 
help himself over curbs. "This is the 
one profession, I suppose, where I 
could work as long as I have," he 
said. But retirement from teaching 
would not mean an end to his work. 
There would be more time in fact for 
his writing. 
The attention Skinner attracted 
• 
with the publication of Beyond 
Freedom and Dignity more than two 
years ago has affected him very 
little. He became an instant cele-
brity, appearing on several television 
talk shows. In the Spring of 1972, 
Skinner came to Yale for three days 
and allowed a panel of critics to open 
fire on him and his theories. 
He seems to have grown weary of 
such distractions. While we talked, 
the phone rang. Someone on the 
other end offered him a speaking 
engagement. "No, I'm sorry," he 
said, "I'm turning down everything 
without exception. That sounds very 
interesting, but if I took every 
interesting offer, I would never get 
any work done." 
During the past year, Skinner told 
me, he has refused invitations for 
expenses-paid speaking engage-
ments in Hawaii, Switzerland, and 
Palm Springs. Why not go and 
enjoy the free vacation? 
"Why would I want to go to Palm 
Springs?" he answered. "I'd be 
bored there; there'd be nothing for 
me to do there." 
Implicit in the comment was 
Skinner's dedication to his work. He 
described the intense effort involved 
in his writing. "I write very, very 
slowly,'' he said. ''Someone figured 
it out to one or two words a minute." 
Though critics often compliment 
Skinner for the clarity of his writ-
ings, they frequently misinterpret 
his meaning -
a pattern to which 
he has resigned himself. When his 
Utopian novel Walden Two was pub-
lished in 1948, Life magazine called 
it "a slur upon a name, a corruption 
of an impulse." Skinner himself be-
lieves that Thoreau could have 
• appreciated the community he 
designed. He read me an early re-
view of his next book, written to 
correct the mistaken interpretations 
that followed the publication of 
Beyond Freedom and Dignity. 
Skinner held up the review and 
pointed to a typographical star ap-
pearing next to it in the clipping 
which signified the importance of 
the review. "My publisher sent me 
this with a note saying 'oh look isn't 
this great,'" Skinner said dryly. 
The review was highly unfavorable. 
Skinner, it asserted, recommended 
controlling human behavior by 
threat of punishment, that is, by 
pairing unacceptable behavior with 
aversive physical or mental conse-
quences. 
"I've spent my life arguing that 
people should be free from aversive 
control,'' Skinner said. "I just don't 
understand it," he said of the review. 
"This isn't someone writing about 
my book - it's someone letting 
out some ideas he already had about 
B.F. Skinner." 
The assumption that any control 
of human behavior must be coercive 
is not uncommon among Skinner's 
critics. He argues that their mistake 
is assuming that behavior is ever free 
from one sort of control or another. 
Once man has admitted that here-
sponds to structured contingencies 
in his environment, he may learn to 
manipulate them to solve the prob-
lems of social organization in the 
20th century. 
Walden Two speculates about pos-
sible manipulations. Only its live-
stock are controlled by threat of 
punishment. Its human members 
live there because they like it. The 
community's managers and planners 
have eliminat.ed aggressive behavior 
between members. Each resident 
contributes about four hours of labor 
a day to the necessities of subsist-
ence. The remaining time is devoted 
to leisure, athletics, or creative and 
intellectual pursuits. 
Skinner believes that realistic so-
lutions to current social problems 
must come in piecemeal fashion. "No 
one in this society could have the 
position Frazier does in Walden 
Two," he said. Yet he remains ena-
moured of the vision of that myth-
ical community. He smiles openly 
when he speaks of it. He believes 
most people would prefer it to the 
lives they presently live. 
I asked him if given the chance he 
could create such a community 
today."! never had the courage to 
found Walden Two when I was 
younger," Skinner said, avoiding my 
question but revealing more than I 
had asked for."Now of course I'm 
too old." He glanced at me and then 
looked away quickly. It was as if he 
had just excused himself to a young 
admirer for something he ought to 
have tried. 
As I was leaving his office, 
Skinner consulted a bookcase and 
presented me with reprints of two of 
his articles. "Here's some reinforce-
ment for you," he said. 0
