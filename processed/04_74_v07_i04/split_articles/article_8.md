he had a huge gin in his hand and 
said with an impish smile, "I'm Lou 
Kahn, who are you?" How different 
from Harvard which I had recently 
left in despair. There my promising 
beginning as a student had been cut 
short by a fateful indiscretion. I 
carried a book on Frank Lloyd 
Wright into the first year drafting 
room and then went on to defend my 
interest to our haughty professor. 
-
This brought down on my bewildered 
head all the awful old baggage of the 
Bauhaus system, and led me even· 
tually to Pennsylvania. There Louis 
Kahn had opened the window and 
invited us by his example and his 
work, to look out and see. And I 
could sense that the International 
~ Style, which had purged history and 
which had distorted and isolated 
modem architecture, was now losing 
its influence; the past with its tradi-
tions, monuments, and ruins was 
being restored to us. 

We were taught design with an 
approach that had only a tangential 
relationship to form. How was the 
essence of a library different from 
that of a museum, of a fair from a 
market place? We were encouraged 
to search for a primary concept 
which gave intuitive choice a 
reason -
a reason which would be 
validated by a sense of fitness and 
appropriate feeling, rsther than mere 
physical utility. In fact, we tried to 
sharpen our insights by cultivating a 
disengagement from formal commit· 
ments at the early stages of work. 
« This attitude made us more receptive 
to historical influence, because we 
felt rewarded by discoveries of 
meaning that were independent of 
style. As a result, the context for 
architectural design was enlarged 
and enriched not only by historic 
examples of building, including the 
building of cities, but also by draw-
ing upon achievements in all the 
humanities. Lou could find the 
premise for a building in the Arabian 
Nitlhts or the piano music of Beet· 
hoven. 

Cities, and the design of buildings 
in cities, were naturally seen as an 
issue, not of isolated structures, but 
of making places and streets. The 
larger meaning of the city was regar· 
ded as a primary influence on indi· 
vidual buildings. We were taught to 
integrate them into the idea of the 
street or the public place and to ad· 
just their conceptual organization

I 
and physical arrangement to a pur· 
pose greater than themselves. To 
emphasize this point, Lou would 
speak of beautiful cities made up of 
ugly buildings. On the other hand, 
the separate structures along Park 
A venue, each with its little plaza, 
were to him disturbing, discon· 
nected and absurd-he called them 
overstuffed matrons. Mies van de 
Robe, and even Lou's beloved Le 
Corbusier, had done much to disin· 
tegrate the fabric of the city to 
which Kahn, almost alone, felt such a 
profound loyalty. 

Shortly after my arrival at Penn· 
sylvania, Vincent Scully came to the 
University and gave a lecture on 
Kahn and Frank Lloyd Wright, and 
showed beautifully how the concep· 
tion and mood of Wright's early 
buildings, particularly Unity Temple 
and the Larkin Building, were reas· 
serted in Kahn's work. Wright's 
notion of structure is dependent on 
the space which it shapes and 
modifies. As a result, there is a 
strong expressive purpose in the way 
the building is made to stand up, and 
Kahn's work, while differing in many 
respects, is also particularly rich in 
its concentration on structure as a 
carrier of meaning. 

But Kahn had a different idea of 
mystery, less exuberant, less dark, 
though no less brooding and impres· 
sive. This idea issued from a strict· 
ness of construction and the 
assertive willingness to share the 
meaning of an architectural decision 
with the beholder- a willingness 
reflected in his conversation and 
teaching. In the buildings of 
Ahmedabad, the union of brick and 
concrete slab construction are 
analyzed and argued, until a formal 
situation is found which proclaims 
the stresses at work, the nature of 
materials, and their function in rela· 
tion to the larger purposes of the 
space they define. The way these 
rooms are lit, their dimension and 
sound, are finally intended to convey 
a conception of value and an idea of 
conduct. They are intended to speak. 

This didactic, ethical discipline 
should be the criterion of all 
architectural decisions; it qualifies 
all reasons of the heart, resulting in 
the austere, grave mood of the work, 
and allowing you to trust what you 
see. Wright's purpose was never as 
rabbinical. For Kahn, architecture 
was a way of sharing the mystery, 
rather than weaving the spell. 

Largeness of spirit was Louis 
Kahn's greatest gift. It opened him 
to everything that is profound and 
beautiful in the record of civilization, 
permitting him truly to venerate 
what is fine in the new as well as the 
old, and to use this inspiration in his 
teaching and his work. He under· 
stood the purpose and power of tradi· 
tion at a time when process and 
change are valued for their own 
sake, and managed amid both the 
trivial and awesome distractions of 
contemporary life to create about 
him an aura of stillnesR and concern 
for truth. Yearning for the timeless, 
he was drawn to what has endured.

TheY ale Art Gallery and the unfin. 
ished Yale Center for British Art, 
two buildings flanking Chapel 
Street, mark the beginning and the 
end of the career of Louis Kahn-the 
architect who for so many of us 
meant more than any other in our 
time. As so often happens with archi· 
.. 
tects, that beginning did not come 
until late. Lou Kahn was already in 
his fifties when President Griswold 
asked him to design the addition to 
the Yale Art Gallery. That became, 
as the critics say, his first "mature 
work"; it was just 20 years later 
that his death overtook him, and 
stunned the rest of us. 

The blow was staggering, not be-
cause 73 is so young, but, I guess, 
because we thought he was immor· 
tal. He didn't need death; he didn't 
even seem to need sleep. The loneli· 
ness of his dying in Pennsylvania 
Station, 90 miles from home, after a 
trip from Bombay, and having hi.s 
very identity mislaid in a series of 
police blunders, makes it shudder· 
ingly clear how late in the centw:y it 
has become. It was suddenly so dark, 
when that light we all were used to 
went out. 

The obituary in Time listed some 
of us as his "disciples," but I think 
the term doesn't fit. He wasn't a 
master in the sense that he exacted 
from us some sort of followship. His 
great strength as a teacher, as he 
once pointed out, was that he wasn't 
facile-things didn't come easily to 
him. The struggle to understand, and 
get it right-more difficult but more 
exhilarating than any architectural 
struggle I, for one, had ever known-
was a struggle which involved him as 
well as his students. He wasn't, 
when I knew him best, laying down 
any laws from on high; like the rest of 
us, he was looking for tho:se laws, 
and making the search take on a 
transcendental importance. He said 
wonderful things along the way and 
I, like his other students, have note-
books full of them ("the sun didn't 
know how wonderful it was until its 
rays fell on the wall of a room"). Out 
of the context of the particular 
search they were part of, Kahn's 
words don't seem to make much 
communicable sense. Even the build· 
ings, magic as they seemed, were not 
altogether complete and independent 
of the search. I remember someone 
asking Kahn how he could justify the 
elevator tower on his little AFL-CIO 
Medical Center in Philadelphia as 
architecture. "That's not architec· 
ture." he replied. 

I first met him in 1955, in the 
Princeton Graduate College. He was 
on a panel about Monumentality (a 
special issue of the fifties) with Paul 
Rudolph. I had just spent some time 
ltct 
in Korea, and had never heard of 
Kahn. I was struck with how small 
he was, and how badly his face was 
scarred (from a fire when he was a 
small child in Estonia). And I can't 
remember anything he said. Paul 
Rudolph was teaching that term at 
Princeton, and Kahn had come down 
from Yale, though he was a Philadel· 
phian. George Howe, another Phila· 
delphian, had brought him to Yale, 
where, according to stories I heard 
later, he had not been a particularly 
revered teacher before he started to 
think about the Art Gallery. My 
most vivid image of Kahn at the 
time (because it was so hard to imag-
ine), was of him as the sidekick of 
Edward Durell Stone. The two of 
them, it was said, played violin and 
piano (in bars?) (for money or din-
ners?) during the Depression. 

In the late fifties, Paul Rudolph 
went to Yale and Kahn left for the 
University of Pennsylvania. His of-
fice in Philadelphia grew. It was run 
then by Tim Vreeland, now at 
UCLA, whom Lou thought was the 
best American architect. (I think he 
may have been, as usual, right.) In 
the school year 1958-59, when I was 
teaching at Princeton, Kahn became 
(on the side, of course) thesis critic 
there. I volunteered to help, because 
every mmute with him meant so 
much to me. One night a week, four 
students and I would drive to Phila-
delphia and meet Lou in his office 
after dinner. We would sit around his 
desk while he looked at four theses, 
and criticized them, and elicited crit-
icism from us, and talked about his 
current projects (there was the 
Jewish Community Centetin Tren-
ton, which was never built,· and there 
were the Richards Laboratories at 
Penn, and later the Salk Center). 

Those evenings were food for a life-
time, not so much for those apho-
risms that were filling our notebooks 
as for the communicated sense of 
caring about how the tiricks in Rich-
ards Laboratories wanted to sit on 
each other, or about the student proj-
ects in front of him. He gave those 
student projects the full weight of 
his concern, not as reflections of him-
self, but as serious, independent 
works. He reserved his scorn (which 
could be nasty) for the projects that 
had been encrusted with the shapes 
of Kahn's own recent inventions, and 
his most joyous transports came for 
the projects where new institutions 
could find form. His favorite of those 
theses, I guess, was one done by 
Robert Church, who became, before 
his death, Dean of the Architecture 
School at the University of Tennes-
see. Church was designing an athlet-
ic center for Stone Mountain, near 
Atlanta; and Kahn managed to im-
pute an Olympian splendor to the act 
of suiting up for events there, or even 
of parking your car to spectate. 

My role after those thesis sessions 
in Philadelphia had been to expand 
upon them, back at Princeton with 
the students. We all read different 
meanings into them, of course, but 
every word had had moment. After 
that year I went to Berkeley, where 
Kahn would sometimes come to talk, 
and I found myself again as an inter-
preter afterwards. That was much 
harder. The weight of Kahn's 
thought-and especially his care-
was not really compressible into a 90 
minute lecture, and my explanations 
Volume seven, number four I April22, 197418 
didn't help enough. 

Projects I had seen in his office 
were built, and some, especially the 
Salk Center in La Jolla, were magic. 
And fascinating new commissions 
came, in India and Pakistan and 
Venice and across the United States. 
But the harassments of fame must 
have brought him closer to despair 
than even his failing vision. Most of 
us who had been moved by him 
speculated about his late works be-
fore they came. Wouldn't they be in 
some way like the deaf Beethoven's 
late quartets? Because, thanks in 
some part to him, we were looking to 
history for parallels, and for direct 
inspiration, and for help. 

Kahn's late works, unless I misun-
derstand, weren't like Beethoven's; 
they were more confident and com-
plete than Kahn • s own earlier works, 
simpler and clearer, far less tentative 
and I am afraid, for me, far less full 
of that searching which lay at the 
center of my regard for him. There is, 
though, not much room for disap-
pointment. Lately, it had come to 
seem from his manner and his work, 
that he had found something at the 
end of his lifelong quest, and that the 
preferences of some of the rest of us 
for the rainbow rather than the pot of 
gold might be temporary too. 

But I don't think it occurred to any 
of us that he was mortal. He was, ex-
cept for Alvar Aalto, the last of the 
century's towering architects- and 
like Aalto, he was reviled for that by 
the new realists of the late sixties. 

It's hard to imagine that there is 
room left for such grandeur of spirit 
to arise soon again. And it is even 
harder, so soon after those dismal 
lonesome events last month in Penn 
Station, to recall that the grandeur 
was based on deep humility and the 
honesty of his search, and was trans-
mitted to a great many people, so it 
will not vanish in the circumstantial 
act of dying. But Lou Kahn's is-
must be -
a spirit that will live. 0
