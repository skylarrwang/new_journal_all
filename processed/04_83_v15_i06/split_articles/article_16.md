Th'e Propaganda War 
One month ago Taiwan Gong Luin Pao, [left] the of-
ficial newspaper of the Taiwanese Independent 
. Movement, printed an article announcing Panner's 
investigation of the surveillance question and tak-
ing credit for supplying the author with critical in-
formation. The same week Mei Li Dao, [right] 
another Chinese language journal sympathetic to 
the Independent Movement, published an editorial 
praising Panner's investigation. The headline

will chase and attack [the KMT] by the wings of 
victory." 

After these two articles appeared, Parmer re-
ceived long distance phone calls from students at 
universities around the country, none revealing 
their names, who claimed that they could prove the 
existence of KMT spies on their campuses and at 
Yale. 

A photostat of an issue of the Boston Tong Shing, 
(November 11 , 1977). The above article was a 
regular column "Mao Ch'ung" (Worms of Mao Tse· 
tung) which was written by pro-KMT students at campuses throughout the country and then com-
piled into one large column. This issue featured a 
denunciation of Cheng Pei-kai, a visiting professor 
in the History department at Yale, and his wife 
Hsu Chi-lieng. The story denounced the pair as 
communists and libertines.

"I can promise you that 
surveillance goes on In 
every campus in the coun· 
try, Including Yale." 

Liang tells a story of KMT activities 
which anyone associated with the 
government will flatly deny: He says 
that the KMT recruits the student 
monitors from the party ranks before 
they leave for the United States. If a 
party member agrees to participate, he 
undergoes a week-long training session 
in which he learns basic surveillance 
techniques. Once he arrives in this 
country, he agrees to submit a regular 
report to a regional office know!] as the 
Coordination 
Council 
for 
North 
America~ Affairs, which for New Eng-
land is located in Boston. The KMT, 
in return, agrees to pay the student an 
extra "stipend" of $400-600 per month. 

"I know a student at Yale in engineer-
ing who has been made an offer. H e 
was offered $500 a month, but he 
refused it." 

"You can always tell a monitor," he 
said. "They have money to travel and 
for big phone bills. How else does a 
student get so much money?" 

The Coordination Council at 
Boston's Government Center is located 
in a new and spacious office, tastefully 
furnished with Chinese screens and 
oriental rugs. It would pass for a 
typical Boston law firm, except for the 
guard at the door and the neatly-
arranged Taiwanese newspapers and 
pamphlets displayed on the end table. 
The pamphlets range in scope from 
"Ceramics 
in Taiwan" 
to "Better 
Fighter Planes for a Free China." 

Students filter in and out of the office 
throughout the day, sitting at a large 
dctsk in the reception room to renew 
their passports. Since 1979, when the 
U.S. and Taiwan broke diplomatic 
relations, the Coordination Council 
has taken the place of a consulate. 

A thin and circumspect man named 
S.C. Lin d•rects the office. R eluctant 
to speak about the issue of surveil-
lance, Lin avoided sensitive questions 
with a studied caution. H e dismissed 
all further questions with a perfunctory 
official statement. "Students are here 
to study," he insisted. "They study 
hard. That's all that they have time to 
do." 

Not everyone believes that all the 
Taiwanese here are so studious. Denny 
Liang and several others have claimed 
that one of Yale's former monitors, 
who has since returned to Taiwan, was 
20 The New Journal/April8, 1983 
a 
graduate student m 
Chemistry 
named Wang Li-dao. These students 
said that Wang had openly admitted 
that he was an agent for the KMT. 
Over the nine-year period that he was 
here, Wang allegedly threatened to file 
reports on a number of his fellow 
graduate students. Since Wang left last 
year, these students have strong suspi-
cions about one other student. But 
since no major incident has taken place 
here since Wang left, their suspicions 
remain unconfirmed. 

While Wang was at Yale, there was a 
great deal of political conflict. One stu-
dent who ran into trouble with the 
KMT then was a graduate student 
named Cheng Pei-kai, who is now a 
visiting professor in History. In the fall 
of 1978, the KMT indefinitely sus-
pended the passports of both Cheng 
and his wife because of their alleged 
leftist beliefs. 

There is little doubt that someone 
was reporting something to the KMT 
about the Chengs while they were at 
Yale. In the months before the KMT 
suspended the Chengs' passports, a 
pro-KMT magazine published by Tai-
wanese students in America called the 
Boswn Tong Shing (Boston Communique) 
had repeatedly denounced the Chengs 
as communists and, on one occasion, 
made indiscreet allusions to their 
private lives. In an article from a col-
umn called "Mao Ch'ung" (Worms of 
Mao"), an anonymous author claimed 
that he had looked over his "records" 
about Cheng's relationship with his 
wife. He asserted that they were well 
known for their "shocking behavior" 
while dating at Yale, and that they had 
become leftists "because it was fashion-
able." (Boston Tong Sing, November 11, 
1977) Cheng denied all the magazine's 
accusations, but, because of possible 
danger to his family still in Taiwan, he 
refused to comment on who could have 
given the KMT such information. 

But students have not been the only 
ones who have charged the KMT with 
monitoring. The United States gov-
ernment has also suspected that some 
form of surveillance takes place. The 
1981 death of a Carnegie-Mellon pro-
fessor named Chen Wen-chen on the 
Island increased their suspicions. The 
summer after the incident, the House 
Asian and Pacific Affairs subcommit-
tee held hearings on Chen's death. 
Having cited evidence that Chen and 
others must have been watched, the 
House ultimately passed legislation 
that would ban arms sales to any coun-
try which conducts organized surveil-
lance on American campuses. 

Ridiculous rumors 
But for all the accusations of KMT 
surveillance, there is also a large group 
of Taiwanese Yale students who openly 
deny the charges, and who describe life 
at Yale in a vastly different way from 
those who tell stories of suspicion and 
intrigue. 

"Such 
rumors only 
hurt 
my 
country," said C.T. Chang, a third-
year Chemical Engineering graduate 
student who in 1982 chaired the 
Chinese Student 
Service, 
Yale's 
Taiwanese club. As for Yang Huan-
shi's arrest in Taipei, Chang has a sim-
ple explanation: "Yang was arrested 
because he is a Communist. The news-
papers in Taiwan printed the letters 
that he wrote to Chinese Communists. 
The KMT had been watching him for 
a long time. How did they get the let-
ters in the Mainland? Well, that's 
where our intelligence is." 

Chang denied that any students are 
on the KMT payroll. "The idea of one 
of us receiving money to report on a 
fellow student is only an insult," he in-
sisted. Opening the bottom drawer of 
his desk, he pulled out a large black 
notebook, a record of all his activities 
as chairman. He flipped open the book 
and pointed to a photo-copy of a letter 
written and signed by a group of 32 
"Taiwanese students and scholars at 
Yale" denying Newsweek's claims. 
"They had no evidence to support their 
charges," said Chang. "Maybe they 
print the article to discourage public 
opinion against arms sales to Taiwan. 
Maybe they were listening co Indepen-
dent Movement propaganda. What-
ever the case, I nor anyone of my 
friends had ever heard of such things 
until we read the article. We were very 
surprised." Newsweek never printed the 
letter. 

Chang also denied that the Coor-
dination Council is a center of sur-
veillance. "Such a charge is ridiculous," 
claimed Chang. The officers of the 
Coordination Council occasionally
