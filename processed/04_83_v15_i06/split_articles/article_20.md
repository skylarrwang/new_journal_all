Solidarity Week
Taylor, Casarella and Russell, all 
Morse sophomores, are roommates. 
"The fact that the three of us room 
together keeps things together," 
Russell said, "and our room acts as a 
kind of nucleus for the organization." 
But keeping shop in a single dorm 
room has sometimes created problems. 
Like the time earlier this year when the 
three students had to store dozens of 
boxes of donated clothes in their room 
in the Morse basement. The boxes 
overflowed into the hallway, creating a 
fire hazard. So they had to hide all the 
boxes from the fire marshal when she 
inspected the room. 

The committee 
has arranged 
numerous lectures and panel discus-
sions over the year and a half of its ex~ 
istence, but the largest and best-
attended of these, by far, was "Solidari-
ty Week" in January 1982. A rally 
drew about 250 students and featured 
speeches by Jan Gross, Slavic Lan-
guages and Literature professor Victor 
Ehrlich, History professors Ivo Banac, 
David Montgomery, 
Wolfgang 
Leonhard and two Solidarity leaders. 
Other professors and leaders of the 
Polish labor movement conducted a 
panel and a workshop. The Polish poet 
Czeslaw Milosz, a Nobel laureate, 
read his work. 

For most people in the West, 
Solidarity is a movement that seems 
next to impossible to oppose. "It's not a 
left-right issue," argued lvo Banac, a 
"Somehow we have to keep 
the situation in the public 
eye." 
hjstory professor who has been actively 
involved with the committee in the 
past. "It's a perfectly black-and-white 
issue." Only one group has ever 
seriously questioned Taylor's reasons 
for supporting Solidarity- the Spar-
ticists (a Communist group that also 
supported the Soviet invasion of 
Afghanistan). 

While everyone seems to support 
Solidarity, nobody seems to support it 
for exactly the same reason, said 
Taylor. To conservatives. it is often a 
weapon against Communism and the 
Soviet Union. To socialists, it is a step 
closer to true socialism. Others support

Solidarity because they are Polish or 
because they are Catholic. But to most 
people, it simply represents a humani-
tarian movement of an oppressed peo-
ple. "I see it more as a constructive 
social movement and not as a foreign 
policy weapon," said Taylor. "I mean, 
Reagan sees it as a club which he can 
use to beat the Soviet Union." 

" The political creativity of 
Solidarity was accompanied 
by tremendous artistic 
creativity." 

Despite this universal appeal, people 
often wonder whether Taylor's brand 
of activism in the community can 
make any impact on the real situation 
in Poland, especially now that Solidari-
ty has been outlawed and driven 
underground. Are the efforts of the 
New 
H aven Solidarity community 
making a difference where it ultimately 
counts? "Short of com~itting acts of 
terrorism, there is very little we can do 
here at Yale," admitted Taylor. "We 
have to deal with the government as a 
legal entity. We're not going to have 
any effect on whatjaruzelski does. The 
global reality is such that we can't have 
an influence in a great sense People 
ask, 'What the hell are five people at 
Yale going to matter?' The impact v .. e 
can have is that we can keep people 
here thinking about it. And the sym-
bolism, I say, is crucial." 

T he most effective response that the 
West can show Solidarity, Sanae 
believes. is to demonstrate widespr<"ad 
public support. And. he said, uni,·ersi-
ty campuses are important centel"i for 
generating that support. "Somehow ''e 
ha\'e to keep the situation in the public 
ev·c." Sanae o;aid ... This kind of support 
'~ill prevent Polish authoriti<"s from 
demoralizing the workers by telling 
them, 'Stop all of this nonsense- no-
body outside really cares."' 

"We arc combatting public 
amnesia," said Taylor. "People forget. 
T here are a lot of people hert· ,,ho 
think Solidarity was just Lech \\alesa, 
and that it is all over now. And orne 
people don't e,·en kno" who Le(·h 
\\'ale.• sa is.~
