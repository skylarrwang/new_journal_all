In one of the more biting passages of 
an essay on Ivy League schools which 
appeared in New Republic last year, 
Paul Fussell quotes President Giamat-
ti: 

The University is the guardian of the 
imagination that both defines and 
asserts our humanity. 

The University is not only the guar-
dian of that human capacity, it is also its 
triumph

Thus the University, 
rooted in history, opened to every new 
impulse, insists on its centrality to 
culture and on its uniqueness. 

"You'd hardly gather," responds 
Fussell, "that the place runs a hockey 
rink and produces the most efficient 
stockbrokers on Wall Street." 

To some extent, Fussell_ has exposed 
a schism which is becoming more ap-
parent in Yale's identity: the determin-
ation to increase corporate and federal 
financial support while at the same 
time maintammg independence and 
integrity. Perhaps no one more aptly 
symbolizes this schism than Giamatti 
himself. Giamatti, the English pro· 
fessor and humanist, is also president 
of a multimillion dollar corporation. 

Giamatti, who is wont to expound 
upon the virtues of academic freedom 
and a liberal education, recently spoke 
to the question of industry's role in the 
university at a conference in Philadel· 
phia. At the conference, he joked that 
before becoming president, "my of-
ficial contact with corporate America 
peaked with the annual ordering of 
textbooks for my classes." 

During his five-year term, however, 
Giamatti has taken a long, hard look at 
the proper role of research support at 
Yale from the private sector. He has 
begun to articulate guidelines and 
principles which will affect the Univer· 
sity for years to come. 

Giamatti believes that Yale has an 
overriding obligation to share the 
results of its research with society. He 
~hinks the public wiiJ gain from the in·


dustrial application of basic research 
conducted on campuses. But he be-
lieves that the University must uphold 
certain principles- independence, free 
exchange of ideas on campus, freedom 
to publish- at the same time that it ac-
cepts corporate money to support its 
research. "The academic imperative to 
seek knowledge objectively and to 
share it openly and freely," he has said, 
clashes with "the industrial imperative 
to garner a profit, which creates the in-
centive to treat knowledge as private 
property." 

While some universities have had 
close relationships with business for 
decades, it was not until recendy that 
university-corporate relations have 
held such promise- and peril- for 
Yale and many other campuses. In the 
late seventies, a number of corpora-
tions discovered that they could benefit 
from interaction with universities just 
as the federal government had been 
doing for years. Recent breakthroughs 
in such fields as genetic engineering at 
universities alerted business to the 
possibqity of forming partnerships 
with academia and marketing such 
research. In 1980, for example, Exxon 
struck a controversial $8 million deal 
with M IT for combustion research. 

Other arangements which have at-
tracted attention include a $6 million 
grant from Du Pont to the Harvard 
Medical School for genetic research 
and a ten-company, $7.5 million con-
tribution to Stanford for a new com-
puter center. 

Yale's relationship with business is in 
a formative state. It was not until early 
1982 that Yale began to assert itself 
more fully in the corporate world. In 
February of 1982, the University 
entered into a three-year, S 1.1 million 
agreement with Celanese, a manufac-
turer of chemicals and fabrics, to con-
duct research in the composition and 
synthesis of enzymes. In lnformalion 
Pl~as~ Almanac's 
1982 
chronology, 
Yale's agreement with Celanese was 
~ighlighted as a subsidy which has 
aroused academic controversy." 

"'ur faculty (in biotechnology) be-
came the industry overnight," asserted 
Joseph Warner, director of Yale's 
Grant and Contract Administration. 
•They were surprised to suddenly find 
themselves 
approached 
by 
multi-


"Our faculty became the In· 
dustry overnight." 

million dollar corporations and newly 
forming firms asking them to become 
involved in the commercial applica-
tions of their research." 

Although Yale has been able to at-
tract industry support in other fields, 
the most striking financial successes 
have come in the fields of biology and 
medicine. This fall, for example, Yale 
and Bristol-Meyers consummated a 
five-year, $3 million agreement to 
fund research in the development of 
new anti-cancer drugs. 

Provost William Brainard singles 
out 
the 
Office 
of Cooperative 
Research, established over the sum-
mer, as the most concrete example of 
Yale's renewed determination to ce-
ment ties with industry. 

Perils and promises

In the midst of corporate America's 
renewed inrerest in academia- both 
locally and nationwide- Giamatti has 
not been alone in voicing concerns 
over the potential dangers which might 
stem from this new relationship. A 
number of professors at Yale, through 
advisory committees and other ave-
nues, have become deeply involved 
with these issues. 

At an October meeting of the Yale 
Chapter of the American Association 
of University 
Professors (AAUP), 
faculty members voiced concerns over 
the increased role of industry at Yale. 
They also voiced alarm at recent deci-
sions of the Reagan administration, in-
cludin~ cutbacks in research support in 
virtually every area save those with 
military applications. 

Recalling a time during the 1960s 
when the federal government funded 
research in the social sciences with 
clandestine or military applications, 
History Professor David Montgomery 
remarked that universities strapped for 
funds might be "tempted to get back 
into the type of research that most of us 
were glad to get rid of in the first 
place." 

Montgomery added: "It's clear that 
there is a great deal of research money 
available from the Defense Depart-
ment, not all of it for the hard sciences 
by any means. But it's not just research 
on how to overthrow the government 
of Chile that concerns me. Such 
research in general puts a damper on 
the Universiry because it must be kept 
secret." 

Stanford President Donald Ken-
nedy, who visited Yale in the fall, 
spoke of the perils and promises of new 
avenues of research which are opening 
up with industry and the government. 
Recalling the lessons of the Manhattan 
project, he warned of the dan~ers in-
herent in certain types of research. 
"The drive to solve the problem fills the 
field, and the rest retreats," he said. 
"You have to put other things into 
focus and make a serious effort to 
foresee 
consequences (of the 
research) "'Genetic engineering is seen 


by many as a potential Pandora's box 
for this decade. 

At the AAUP meeting, some faculty 
members suggested that a greater 
dependence upon external financial 
support might distort the teaching and 
research mission of the university. In 
the field of biology, one professor sug· 
gested that important but less "mar-
ketable" research in fields such as 
evolutionary biology might be neg-
lected in favor of an emphasis on bio-
technology or other more "marketable" 
fields. Another suggested that the 
University, in the hope of attracting 
more funding from the current admin-
istration, might be inclined to hire 
more classical economists in a depart-
ment dominated by Keynesian econ-
omists. 

Provost Brainard believes that there 
is a "good deal of concern in the faculty 
and administration (about such 
issues), enough to insure that interface 
with corporations does not seduce us 
away from our primary mission of the 
advancement and transmission of ... 
precisely those areas of knowledge and 
culture which are not created by the 
market system." 

Brainard contends that a faculty 
member's ability to attract outside 
funding has no bearing on the granting 
of tenure. But in the sciences in par-
ticular a professor's research has a ma-
jor bearing on tenure decisions. "And 
sometimes it's hard to make a distinc-
tion because those who are good at 
research are likely to be successful in 
getting corporate or government 
grants as well." The provost em-
phasizes, however, that those who 
make appointments to tenured posi-
tions do not even have information 
regarding the professor's success in ob-
taining grants. 

The case of MIT

M IT, which perhaps epitomizes close 
university-industry ties, has grown ac-
customed to answering criticism about 
the ethics of such links. "Many of to-
day's questions about the role of in-
dustrv in university research," com-
mented MIT President Paul Gray, 
"arc the same that were asked about 
Government sponsorship (following 
World War II)- questions about the 
relevance of a 
proposed area of 
research to the essential mission of the 
university, about potemial constraints 
upon the direction of the research, and 
on possible pressures for immediate or 
practical results." 

George Dummer, who is Warner's 
counterpart at M IT, recalled that dur-
ing the debate over government's role 
in universities years ago, "McGeorge 
Bundy said that if universities are con-
cerned that the federal government will 
warp the values of the university, they 
should be concerned over university 
policies and their faculty, not the 
government. We're faced with the 
same problems now. It's a matter of in-
ternal standards." 

And the internal standards of MIT, 
claims Dummer, are not very different 
from those of Yale. "Some of our 
specific practices may be different, a11d 
our style and traditions are different," 
he said. "But I can't recall a philo-
sophical area in which we and Joe 
(Warner) are at a difference." Warner 
concurs with Dummer's assessment.
