"We were very vocal," remembered 
David Taylor. "We harrassed a lot of 
people. We sold a lot of buttons to peo-
ple who didn't want to buy buttons." 
Taylor is proud that he harrassed peo-
ple over the last year and a half, 
because harrassment achieved some 
important goals for a small group of 
dedicated students he has been work-
ing with since December of 1981: The 
New H aven Committee in Support of 
Solidarity. 
Chances are Taylor stepped up to 
you sometime last semester out in front 
of Yale Station and asked you if you 
were aware of the workers' plight and 
the scarcity of food in Poland. Chances 
are he or one of his co-workers tried to 
sell you a red and white Solidarity but-
ton to stick on your lapel. They made a 
special point of being obnoxious, and 
by anyone's standards, they succeeded. 
Taylor doesn't spend as much time 
on the pavement as he did last fall. In-
stead. he and the Olher members are 
supporting- Solidarity in a very quiet 
way-collecting art. The committee 
now possesses the only known collec-
tion of Solidarity artwork in the world. 
Irena Gross, a Polish dissident living 
in New Haven who works close)>· with 
the committee, has accumula•ed a vast 
number of illegal Solidarity items 
smuggled out of Poland- anti-gov-
ernment 
poster s, 
undeq~round 
ne\vsletters, 
political caricatures, 
satirical counterfeit 
bills and un-
published photos taken after the im-
position of martial law. 

Much of the art is political in nature. 
and many of the drawings and engrav-
ing-~ are the work of amateur artists in 
prison 
for 
their affiliation 
with 
Solidaritr. For example. there are 
numerous mock postage stamps. used 
envelopes 
illegally 
circulated 
amon~ political prisoner... \\hich play 
off \\ell-known symbolic imagery in 
Poland. The stamps include variations 
on a number of themes. like the ea~lc 
(Poli<>h 
St.ttehood). 
the cro'" (the 
Catholic Church). the crow (the military 
junta) and the anchor (syntbol of 
hope related to the shipworker: -.trike 
in Gdansk) -:..tany of the pieces in the
