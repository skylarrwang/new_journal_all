**Comment: So, where are you going?**

So, where are you going? 
I spend much of my time these days 
sending 
off chunks of myself to 
strangers, hoping they will take an in-
terest, and wondering what I'll be do-
ing this time next year. Freshman 
year, the one thing I could · always . 
worry about if I didn't have any impor-
tan t problems or papers due was, 
"What am I going to do with my life?" 
But now that I'm standing on the 
brink, looking at the void through my 
·mailbox window, I'm beginning to see 
that leaving Yale, though sad, and job 
hunting, though anxiety-ridden, are 
not the greatest causes of concern. The 
important issue: What do I do, sud-
denly, when I find I am vulnerable 
once again, when the paths are not so 
well-paved and the support systems are 
no longer supporting me? How do I 
begin to think about myself? 

Perhaps the worst thing that can 
happen to any of us is that we can 
begin to believe we are the packages we 
present to others-simple, reductive 
resume-s to be accepted or rejected, 
wanted or not wanted, period. Even 
the various images we project in inter-
views are packages. They are not us, 
only fragments of us. Yet if others do 
not want to see more, we question not 
just our image, but our whole being.· 

I remember visiting Yale as a high 
school senior and talking with other 
prospectives who had also been ac-
cepted here. Most of us were less in-
terested in where people came from 
than in what "they did." Were we all so 
well-rounded and involved because 
that satisfied us, or was it because we 
knew that was the package the admis-
sions otlicers wanted? Though not 
everyo_ne 
thought 
so narrowly, 
I 
detected a common conviction that we 
were there because of our records, not 
because of something less easily ar-
ticulated but more substantial- per-
sonality, in a most basic sense of the 
term, the totality, the whole. 

I wonder about the person who was 
just as qualified for Yale as I was but 
who received a rejection letter in the 
mail. He might be stronger than I am 
right now because he learned that 
regardless of what others decide, he 
could succeed on his own terms 
wherever he went. Maybe he realized 
early what I am only realizing now-
inward qualities that may not come 
across on paper, but which will make 
all the difference at some unforeseen 
moment in some unforseen place. 

Having learned to slice, dice ancf 
package ourselves for everything from 
seminars and summer internships to 
graduate schools and jobs, we can all 
too easily be led to believe that apply-
ing is the only way to succeed. Tunnel-
vision sets in. We begin to worry that 
we won't be good enough for the nar-
row tracks we pursue, viewing Career 
Advisory Service not as a starting 
point, but as a place to cram for life. 
And what if we don't get the intern-
ship, or get turned down by our top 
three choices for law school? T he 
spring comes and our roommates are 
winning fellowships and people are 
getting things left and right, and some 
of us aren't getting anything this time 
around. It becomes difficult to believe 
there's nothing wrong with us if we're 
applying for things and not getting 
them.

Just as bad as the rejection is the lack 
of destination. We have been taught by 
our parents and teachers to make plans 
and pursue them, and that works well 
until we carry it too far and discover 
we cannot enjoy the present unless all 
aspects of our lives are on track. Fear 
of confusion, need for resolution of any 
vacant spaces or weak links in our 
lives. This view ignores what happens 
so frequently: People go places and do 
things for very good reasons, then fall 
into situations they never expected, 
then look back on it as if that was the 
way it was going to happen all along. 
But we don't yet know what was go-
ing to happen all along, and that is one 
of the reasons for all the activity here, 
the time-race and the tension. So many 
o f us are looking forward, uncertain of 
what we will find, We seek through our 
exertion to obtain some assurance that, 
wherever we are headed, we can get to 
where we want to go. Every moment 
spent on campus is informed by the 
knowledge of what we really should be 
doing, based on an invisible network of 
assumptions about where we might 
want to be, years from now. 

It's easier for me to turn on the 
achievement mode and say, "I'm going 
to work hard this week, so I can have 
fun later," than it is for me to take that 
moment at any given time. The fallacy 
is not only that I can choose the time 
when I'll be happy, but also that I can 
mete out my life in pure, productive 
blocks of either work or play. Again, 
_the rushing forward, all hopes and all 
effort focused on the tape stretched 
across the track in the distance.
