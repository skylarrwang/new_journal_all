ture may be a performance, but I don't 
want to be told that." 
The podium and the stage 
Ferlo welcomes applause, though, in 
its proper place: the theatre. He has 
acted in several Yale productions, 
playing Mr. Peachum in Tht Thrtt· 
Ptnny Opaa, the bishop in Michael 
Malone's Diftnder of the Faith, and the 
psychiatrist in Equus. The latter was 
"the most ambitious thing I've ever 
tried, and the best production I've been 
in," Ferlo said. Applause may have 
driven him crazy in lectures, but he 
was delighted when the final perfor-
mance of Equus received a 15-minute 
standing ovation. 
"When everything was up in the 
air," said Harlan, "we talked about 
Roger's going to New York as an 
actor." But they concluded that the one 
thing less likely than Roger getting 
tenure at Yale would be Roger finding 
steady work in the equally overcrowd-
ed field of theatre. 
Everything was "up in the air" last 
year when Ferlo, still unpublished, 
decided that tenure was an impossible 
dream. H e began to put out feelers to 
other collc~es but got nowhere fast. 
"The longer one stays here, the harder 
it is to ~et a job somewhere else. They 
all say, 'If you were there, why come 
here?' There are fewer jobs for teachers 
now than ever- it's a buyer's market. 
One small college I approached said I'd 
have to start up the academic ladder all 
over again if they hired me." 
Ferlo didn't like the academic ladder 
the first time he climbed it. As the 
prospect of finding a secure, tenured 
niche somewhere grew fainter, Ferlo 
returned to an old and deep ambition: 
the priesthood. Suddenly, it seemed to 
be not only honorable but practical. 
He could be a teaching priest, either 
using his teaching abilities to serve the 
church and its community or letting a 
new perspective inform his l;ecular 
teaching. "It's a decision to act much 
more publicly,., said Ferlo. "Tempera-
mentally, 
I'm just not suited to 
academia, to that separation from peo-
ple and their needs. I don't want to 
spend the rest of my life writing 
tOmes." As a priest. Ferlo hopes to get 
off the tightrope and join the different

drives within him: performing, teach-
ing, worshipping, learning. 
The idea was not as appealing to his 
wife, at first. "I was aware when I mar-
ried R oger that he was interested in the 
priesthood in some way," Harlan 
recalled. "I fought against it fiercely." 
She was afraid of losing her identity as 
a priest's wife; it was a role that she felt 
had little to do with who she was. "But 
after the job-hunting frustrations, I 
had to agree that he might as well bag 
it. H e needs to get away from Yale in 
order to make a change in his identity. 
He couldn't do that with another piece 
of paper from Yale." 
"If you spend your time on 
teaching, you tend to get 
penalized." 
Ferlo is unsure of the form his 
ministry will take. He hopes to find a 
parish in need of a pastor but will not 
rule out some form of secular teaching. 
He will teach the Yale Summer Pro-
gram's Shakespeare course before he 
enters the General Theological 
Seminary in New York this fall. In the 
meantime, he is studying Hebrew and 
Greek, parenting Lizzie, 
cooking 
(pasta is a specialty), and preparing for 
the big move. "Yale is basically giving 
me six months severance pay by allow-
ing me not to teach this term," Ferlo 
said. "It's very generous of them." 
H e reflected for a moment. "You 
know, I'm perversely grateful to the 
English Department. If I hadn't had 
my problems here, I might not have 
examined the reasons I was teaching. I 
might not have realized what I really 
wanted to do."
