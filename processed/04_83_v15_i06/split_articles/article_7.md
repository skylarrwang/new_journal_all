About this issue 
In our cover story this issue, we take a 
look at an extremely sensitive topic-
the question of student spies on Yale's 
campus. Over the past three months, 
TNJ associate editor Morris Panner 
has interviewed many foreign stu-
dents, here and elsewhere, who are 
deeply concerned about the practice of 
surveillante on American campuses. 


These are people who fear they cannot 
speak freely or critically about their 
governments without e ndangering 
their political status back home. They 
are convinced that a small number of 
paid student informants arc keeping an 
eye on the university and are peri-
odically 
filing 
reports 
about 
any 
suspicious political activity. 

At the center of the controversy IS 
Taiwan, a country which now has over 
20,000 citizens studying in the United 
States. 
At countless universities-
among them, Stanford, U.C. Davis 
and the 
University of Chicago-
Taiwanese have claimed that monitors 
are harrassing and 
sometimes 
threatening them. Panner found a 
numbe r 
of T aiwanese graduate 
students at Yale -as many as a half 
dozen- who have made similar ac-
cusations of surveillance. 

In researching the story, Panner 
confronted some special problems. 
First, many of Panner's sources did not 
speak English, and a large portion of 
the written evidence- including num-
erous Chinese newspapers and official 
Taiwanese documents- had 
to be 
translated before he could even begin 
to piece the information together. Se-
cond, very few Taiwanese students 
were willing to talk about this question 
at all, and fewer still were willing to 
reveal their own names. Third, Panner 
found that the few who were willing to 
speak publicly about the surveillance 
question often had axes of their own to 
grind. Because Taiwan's security is so 
intimately tied to good relations with 
the U.S., and because so many Tai-
wanese a re studying here, a whole con-
stellatio n 
of political 
factors 
and 
loyalties come into play. And finally, 
because of the sensitive nature of the 
topic, Panner had to consider carefully 
several legal questions. For invaluable 
advice in this area, we would like to 
thank Frank Cochran, a law partner of 
one of our directors, Peter B. Cooper. 
Needless to say, Panner invested a n 
enormous amount of time into the 
research. We think the whole issue is a 
most serious and disturbing one, a 
matter which the university should 
take a hard look at. 

On a more personal note, we'd like to 
say something 
about one of our 
graduating seniors, someone who has 
been an integral part of the magazine 
since its rebirth in 1981. Former 
editor-in-chief Andy Court helped 
establish the new magazine two years 
ago, givin ~ it its editorial identity. He 
edited The New journal with careful 
eyes, a nd he listened to a nd advised all 
of us. H e is a special person. We11 miss 
him. 

Look fo r us in September. 


**Letters: The Alternative Tour**

The Alternative Tour 
To the Editor: 
In "Another New Haven" (The New 
Journal, February 25, 1983), Katherine 
Scobey was right to say that the Alter-
native Tour does not directly decry the 
wealth 
of particular 
individuals. 
However, to look at the contrasts of 
poverty and wealth in New Haven 
neighborhoods is to see structures of 
inequality and injustice. We cannot 
help but decry such structures if we are 
committed to attacking the root causes 
of poverty. Any given community has 
a limited amount of material wealth. ff 
one 
group has 
a disproportionate 
amount of that wealth, this implies 
poverty for man y of the rest. It is un-
fortunate that Katherine Scobey did 
not devote more attention to this in her 
article. Failure to grasp this point leads 
to a misunderstanding of both the tour 
and, in my view, the city.

**Letters: Toob gets no respect**
**Author: Bennett E. Howser**

Toob gets no respect 
T o the Editor: 
H ow disheartening that many still 
hold prejudices against inner tube 
water polo ("D as Toob," TN} February 
25, 1983). But more dishearteni~g 
than this is that so many people sull 
hold prejudices against anyone who 
doesn't share their own priorities and 
lifestyles. Perhaps when the varsitY 
athletes quit stereotyping non-athlete~ 
as "small, fat, pallid-faced people, 
then we non-athletes will stop referring 
to them as "'big, dumb, insensitive 
jocks." 
Small, fat, pallid-faced, 
completely wimped out 
and sincerely yours, 
Benne tt E. Howser
