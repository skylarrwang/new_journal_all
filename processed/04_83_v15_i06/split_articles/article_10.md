EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
A friend ran for weeks with the goal 
of getting in shape to run to the top of 
East Rock. But on the day she ran to 
the top she discovered the parking lot 
littered with trash and motorists blar-
ing music. I have made the same trip 
myself and fou nd the best part is an 
unforseen bend on the shaded side of 
the h ill, long before the summit, a 
dark, cool passage in the woods. 

Some of us spend four years here 
with the back-of-the-brain fear of not 
having somewhere equally safe and 
prestigious to go after college. After 
high school, people asked, "Where are 
you going?" Yale, they had all heard of 
that spot. What more could an uncer-
tain high school senior have asked for 
than a destination with all the right 
connotations? Now, if we become ad-
d icted to those connotations, the cost of 
the next fix is becoming a package once 
again. And if we believe we are the 
package and little else, then we should 
devote every available moment to im-
proving its appearance so it will im-
press those who receive it. A Yale 
education becomes nothing more than 
a race to gather more credentials 
before the next round of applying. 

But the one brand of applying we 
seem not to have mastered is applying 
our studies to our lives, connecting 
what we know to what we are. Most 
professors do not begin their lectures 
by saying, "Okay, there you are in 
you r scats and here's the topic of 
today's talk and here's how the topic 
relates to your life." We are expected to 
meet the materia] haJfway, swimming 
the emotional and intellectual distance 
from our scat to the podium. 

Spring of senior year, I find myself 
drifting and dreaming. Instead of 
focusing on Darwinism at 9:45 a.m., 
I'm flailing in the waves of more im-
mediate concerns. Did I make enough 
mailings? Is it worth it to drive up to 
Boston for that interview? And where 
will I live? And will I be happy? I find 
my future needs and desires far more 
compelling than the ceaseless struggle 
of the species here and now. 

Often distracted, often enchanted, 
sometimes both at once, I have loved 
this place at the same time I've hated 
myself for taking it and everything else 
so seriously. And now in the last 
weeks, I find myself attempting to 
memorize the texture of a stone waJI or 
map the way the shadows fall, or end 
my last article for a publication that 
means so much to me by just writing-
goodbye .
