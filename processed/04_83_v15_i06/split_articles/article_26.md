The station, came to sound like "Toad's 
Radio," in the words of Henderson. 
He smugly added that thanks to his 
club, "They don't sound like that 
anymore." 

As Henderson chuckled over his cup 
of lukewarm Brewery coffee, a note of 
vindictiveness surfaced in his attitude 
toward PLR. Yet he spoke politely, 
calmly. He explained the animosities 
that develop in a town where ag-
gressive clubs and promoters vie for 
support and sponsorship from one 
pivotal actor- WPLR. "This is the 
perfect example. Let's say there are 
two shows going on the same night, 
one at Toad's and one at the Agora. 
Let's say we offered PLR sponsorship 
for Squeeze and instead they chose to 
sponsor Jonathan Edwards at Toad's. 
I'd think that Chris Kampmaier was an 
idiot, because he let his personal feel-
ings get in the way of his business sense 
-if he has any business sense." 

Though Kampmaier said PLR is now 
"as promotionally active with the 
Agora as with Toad's," he acknow-
ledged that his personal friendship with 
Toad's Place owner Mike Spoerndle 
makes the distance between 
1294 
Chapel and 300 York Street perhaps 
the shortest six blocks in New Haven. 

All the interlocking strands of commit-
ment and hand-washing come together 
most clearly in the promotion of a new 
band's record: radio support, followed 
by a local club date, followed by record 
company promotion in the local record 
store and radio advertisements- what 
most people lump together as "hype"-
culminating in the final promotional 
push the day or two before and after an 
act's local gig. 

Does it work? How strong is the con-
nection between what PLR's managers 
decide they like and what ends up play-
ing and selling in New Haven? 

An illustration: the case of the Go-
Go's, the all-girl group from Los 
Angeles whose million-selling 1981 
album Beauty and the Beat resurrected a 
sound not heard since Diana Ross and 
the Supremes- and with a new wave 
"The two hottest musical 
centers in the country are 
New York and L.A.-but 
New Haven could well be 
number three." 
sensibility. PLR's musical overseers 
heard the record before its release, 
"said 'y'know that's damned good,' and 
began playing-wailing-the Go-Go's 
nine months before any radio station 
in the country," said Kampmaier, get-
ting excited at the recollection. PLR 
helped bring the Go-Go's to Toad's 
before the band had any national 
following- and 
only 
100 
people 
showed up at the club; the station 
brought the band back to Toad's a se-
cond time, and 650 people came; a 
third time and the club was packed, 
with another 1000 waiting outside 
unable to get tickets; the fourth time 
the Go-Go's came to town they played 
to 14,000 fans standing on their seats 
at the New Haven Coliseum. 

But such seemingly flagrant taste-
making power does have its checks and 
balances. Music, industry insiders will 
tell you, is a commodity, a product 
promoted and sold much like any other. 
Given the constraints of a competitive 
marketplace, the consumer, and not 
the producer, is the ultimate arbiter of 
taste. While Jason Cutler admits that 
PLR airplay, MTV videoplay and 
local club dates are all important pieces 
of "the pie graph" telling him which 
records 
to 
stock, 
the day-to-day 
preferences of his customers prevail. 

But what subliminal medium or mes-
sage induces a consumer to request a 
record in the first place? Deductive 
reasoning points to a few primary 
decision-makers at the center of the 
yarn: the guys at PLR. 

"Sure, I agree that our three guys 
are important," Kampmaier said 
grudgingly. "But you'll only listen to 
them once or twice if they're wrong. 
The tail does not wag the dog- and we 
are the tail." 

Kampmaier lifted his feet off the 
table, swiveled in the chair, and put his 
hand on the dial of his office FM 
receiver. He gave the knob a twirl and 
swiveled back around, looking pained. 
"You can jam good shit down peoples' 
throats," he said, "but you can't jam 
bad shit down their throats. The fact is 
we're not the only game in town. It's 
just too easy to change the channel."
