Dissident misfits 
I was surprised by how seriously and 
uncritically Lelia Wardwell treated the 
subject of "The Art School on Trial" in 
your last issue. It seems clear from the 
article's presentation of this group of 
self-proclaimed "aesthetic dissidents" 
that their concerns stem much more 
from a personal clash with the Art 
School than from any specific aesthetic 
ideal. It is a pity that these individuals 
felt their creativity constrained by the 
"controlling elite" of the Yale School of 
Art, but this is an inevitability at any 
school and in any department. I would 
pose, however, that the "aesthetic 
dissidents" do not even have a case, 
because their work does not substan-
tiate their complaints with a truly 
responsive or original alternative. 

I am not offering an unqualified 
defense of the Yale School of Art, for it 
is a small school that perhaps lacks 
more variety of approach than other 
larger an institutions. But the school 
does not pretend to be otherwise. As 
far a!. the School's "Euro-centric" ap-
proach is concerned, it is, as Barnaby 
Fitzgerald suggested, not only preten-
tious, but also dishonest for the school 
to lay claims to an Asian or African 
aesthetic sensibility which it docs not 
possess. 

The creative isolation of which these 
dissidents complain seems to me to be 
self-imposc.-d. It is the role of an 
academic institution (and the Yale art 
community does center around it 
school) to offer the individual a specific 
~t _of formal guidelines; it is the in-
dtvtdual's duty to understand and then 
respond to them. As these dissidents 
have completely side-stepped these 
guidelines, rather than reacted to them 
constructively, they rob their crusade 
of either 
ideological or artistic 
credibilitv. The "crits" to which Bird 
B~enner . o~jt'cts so violently and, I 
mtght add, incoherently. provide an 
arena for this responsiveness. My only 
c<-?mplaint of them, as opposed to 
Btrd's, is that ther are not even specific 
enough, and that students do not take 
enoush advantage ol this opportunity 
to exclmngc ideas and yes, to provoke 
each. other (though not in the ag-
gresstv(' '>cnse). For, I am afraid that, 
with my Western orientation, I feel the 
purpose of art is to provoke thought 
and emotion.

Devil worship 
As a lover of both the form and content 
of Sterling Memorial Library, I wish 
to respond to your disturbing article, 
"The Underworld Around Us," by 
Geoff Hayward and Tom Feigelson, 
(TN}, 
December 
1, 
1982). The 
authors state that the building is "a 
monument to its creator," but it has 
always seemed to me to be a monu-
ment to craftsmanship, to an attention 
to details that has all but disappeared 
from public buildings. Far from irrita-
ttng or depressing me, the glimpse of 
one of Sterling's whimsical creatures 
invariably cheers me. It has never been 
my feeling that the "satire" is a con-
temptuous or cynical attack on the 
scholarly community from without, for 
my own sense of the ludicrousness, as 
well as the loftiness and sanctity of the 
scholar's calling is too highly developed 
to allow any reaction other than sym-
pathy with the satirist. The scholar 
who has never seen the words "You are 
a joke" staring back at him from the 
page has simply not been a scholar 
long enough. 

The issue of maturity is certainly 
relevant here; the authors' fear of 
sculpted devils seems a bit immature, 
as though they had seen too many 
demonic-possession 
movies. 
If the 
depiction of demons is a sacrilege, the 
greatest artists of the Western world 
have all been frightful blasphemers. 

The paranoia and self-importance of 
your article reache'> its climax in the 
following passage: .. Above the most 
westerlY set of ~~indO\"s (of TrumbuJJ) I 
therc i~ a monke>· and an ass. \~'hat 
were thev trving to makt': out of us? 
Which w~ s~p~scd to bc:st character-
ize thc students of Trumbull College?" 

[ hope and trust that the average 
Yale student is not so solipsistic as to 
assume that every detail of his college's 
architecturc is meant to express or 
symbolize his own personality. 

No, not even prim objections of the 
1931 Harkness Hoot can convince me 
that Sterling is not a great building in 
its own heterogeneous, rambunctious 
American way. Yale is an American 
university, not Oxford or Cambridge, 
God be praised. I only hope that the 
authors someday become less "inward-
looking and hostile," and learn to love 
the poor little demons.

Insensitivity? 
Lindsay Rodes, m her article on the 
kitchen 
under Commons, (TNJ, 
January 21, 1983) in an attempt to il-
lustrate graphically the large size of an 
oven, writes that, "Five or six people 
could fit inside." The juxtaposition of 
this statement to a story in the same 
issue on the Holocaust Survivors' Film 
Project sickened me. Rarely have I 
ever been confronted with such an ap-
palling editorial blunder. 

This is not all that I found objec-
tionable; tht' comparison should have 
been deleted even were the food article 
to have appeared alone. In ovr time, to 
speak of an oven in terms of its capaci-
ty for human beings demonstrates an 
acute lack of either awareness or sen-
sitivity to the Nazis' systematic mass 
murder of Jews and Gypsies, and, 
more generally, intellectuals, the han-
dicapped, the clergy and dissidents. 
For many, the image of an oven with 
people inside forcefully recalls these 
horrors.
