EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
"You have to take what I say about 
Yale with a grain of salt," said Roger 
Ferlo. "In some ways, I'm disillusioned 
with it." The popular English professor 
had much to say about Yale as he sat in 
his book-lined penthouse in Ezra 
Stiles. But he was not complaining. 
Rather, he was explaining his decision 
to leave Yale and academia for a dif-
ferent form of teaching. After 10 years 
here, Ferlo is planning to become an 
Episcopal priest. 

Ferlo might well have ended up in 
the priesthood anyway-as a teenager, 
he lived the life of a "sanctuary rat," 
singing in the choir and playing the 
organ. Yet his frustration with Yale 
certainly 
hastened 
his 
change of 
career. Roger Ferlo is not shy about 
saying that he is disappointed in the 
University: in the careerism of the 
faculty and in the strictures of the 
tenure system. But he is quick to stress 
that his decision is not a break in his 
career but an extension of it. "I'm clos-
ing off a ten-year parenthesis and 
resuming the sentence," he explained. 
"It feels much more continuous to do 
this than to be an academic." 

Over these 1 0 years, Roger Ferlo 
has been something of a maverick in 
the English Department. In faculty 
meetings and in public, he has criti-
cized 
its 
ivory-tower 
isolation 
in 
general and its rigid tenure process in 
particular. "In the best of all possible 
worlds, tenure would be abolished," 
Ferlo said with a sigh. "Only if you 
produce these printed pages are you 
worth anything: Without a published 
book by 29 or 30, in this league, you 
might as well give up." A mischievous 
look crept into the 31-year-old Ferlo's 
eyes. "I didn't play by the rules. If you 
spend your time on teaching, you tend 
to get penalized. If you teach well now, 
you're not likely to stay teaching very 
long." 

If there is a physical stereotype for 
English professors, Ferlo does not con-
form to it. With his longish black hair, 
closely-cut beard, and short, wiry 
build, he looks more like Ringo Starr 
than Mr. Chips. Only his large brown 
eyes seem appropriate for a professor. 
They are alert, playful and sometimes 
a triOe detached, as if each new thing 
Ferlo learns causes him to adjust a 
complicated model in his mind. 

And Ferlo's manner is hardly that of 
an absent-minded professor. Talking 
to him, one is struck by his awareness 
and his involvement in the conversa-
tion. Words have an almost physical 
substance for him. He launches them 
in rapid volleys, speeding them to their 
destination with dramatic gestures. He 
listens with his body, tensing and curl-
ing in his chair in response to what is 
said. He speaks clearly, often poking 
fun at himself. Ferlo's aim is not to im-
press the listener with his knowledge 
but to share it. In short, to teach. He 
takes his teaching seriously and is 
often dismayed at the way it seems to 
get lot_t in the academic world. 

The glitz place 
"For many years, I was very bitter 
about Yale," Ferlo said. "Not so much 
what it did to me, but what it did to 
others. It's the profession itself: from 
being a calling to teach and to learn, 
it's caved in to become a careerist 
scramble up the ladder. The hardest 
There was just one 
problem: he hadn't 
published anything. 
thing is to realize that there's a world 
outside, something else to measure 
self-worth by~" 

Ferlo smiled wryly. "When I was 
deciding to become an academic, Yale 
was the glitz place. You wanted to get 
there. Someone told me at the time, 
'You go to Yale, you lose your soul.' I 
scoffed. I still think that's an exaggera-
tion, but the pressure can be deadly. It 
would have been nice to teach at a 
small college like the one I attended-
to get tenure and to feel that sense of 
'collegiality' that's lacking here." 

Ferlo's alma mater is Colgate 
University, a small college in upstate 
New York, where he first studied phil-
osophy. Colgate was an intellectual 
watershed for Ferlo. Following the ex-
ample of teachers he admired there, he 
decided to become one himself. Ferlo's 
foremost influence was a literature pro-
fessor named Jonathan Kistler, who 
turned him on to Shakespeare. Re-
called Ferlo: "Kistler knows he's a 
legend. As with most good teachers, he 
has a real charlatan-showman streak." 

Ferlo smiled. "I'm no exception." He 
admired Kistler's intellect and magnet-
ism but was disturbed by "the way the 
course turned into a cult of per-
sonality- Kistler's personality, not 
Shakespeare's." In this way, Kistler 
gave Ferlo a model for intellectual 
showmanship and an illustration of 
how it can go too far. Ferlo has tried to 
walk this tightrope ever since, with 
varying degrees of success. 

Ferlo came to Yale in 1973 as a 
graduate student 
English. He 
drifted from philosophy to English the 
same way he drifted from Catholicism 
to Episcopalianism: not with a crisis of 
conversion, but with a pleasant feeling 
of settling into something more com-
fortable. He spent his apprenticeship 
period as a T A and as a professorial 
jack-of-all-trades. "I've taught 'em all," 
he drawled in the world-weary tones of 
a riverboat gambler. "115, 125, 129, 
both terms of Shakespeare, a senior 
seminar, a college seminar ... " 

Writer's block 
By 1981, Ferlo had a devoted following 
among students and a growing reputa-
tion as a dynamic teacher. There was 
just one problem: he hadn't published 
anything. His writer's block was so in-
tense that he could barely finish his 
dissertation, let alone a sciJO!arly arti-
cle of the type smiled upon by the 
English Department. As a result, the 
Department terminated Ferlo's con-
tract. "It was the nadir of my fortunes ," 
he recalled. 

Within a month, however, an ex-
traordinary event reversed those for-
tunes. Ferlo was one of three winners 
of the first annual Undergraduate 
Teaching Prize. "I felt tremendously 
vindicated, amused- and furious!" 
Ferlo said. He promptly wrote a letter 
to the chairman of the English Depart-
ment, suggesting that his termination 
be reconsidered. "Three days later, I 
was reinstated. It was very gratifying 
to see the egg on their faces," he said 
with satisfaction. 

Ferlo accepted an invitation to 
become a resident fellow of Ezra Stiles. 
He and his family have lived in Stiles 
since then. Their apartment is orderly 
and spacious, taking up the entire lOth 
floor of the Stiles Tower. The living 
room is dominated by a green harp-
sichord that is half the size of a squash 
court. Beneath that is the cello Ferlo is 
learning to play. Music is a very 
private enjoyment for this otherwise 
outgoing person: he can play for hours 
at a time in private but will freeze up 
when asked to play for someone else. 

The exception to this is a certain 
flautist with whom he plays duets: his 
wife. 

Anne Harlan is as short as Ferlo. 
Below her long brown bangs are calmÂ· 
blue eyes that look straight ahead as 
she speaks. The fact that Harlan, who 
programs computers for a public lib-
rary, did not take her husband's sur-
name is characteristic of her indepen-
dence. She hates to be thought of as 
"Mrs. Him," and Ferlo is happy to sup-
port her on that. "It's been a great 
satisfaction to us that only one of us is 
attached to this institution," he said. "I 
was always determined that I was mar-
rying him and not a Yale professor," 
she added. "It's nice being a professor's 
wife- you have a lot of freedom, cer-
tainly more than a priest's wife. But 
I'm in touch with a different work 
philosophy and a different reality." 

"It's an odd sort of situation here at 
Stiles. I don't feel like I lit in very well 
here," said Harlan. "We're on display, 
and we're meant to be on display. I 
think Elizabeth is probably happiest 
here, because she doesn't mind being 
on display." 

"Lizzie" is a tiny, talkative three-
year-old, whose dark hair and sharp 
features strongly resemble her father's. 
At the end of his first term 
of Shakespeare, Ferto had 
lost 15 pounds. 
She also resembles him in her sense for 
the theatrical, her artistic bent. She is 
seriously involved in finger painting at 
the Calvin Hill Day Care Center and 
will display her creations at a moment's 
notice. Her parenrs encourage her, 
commenting on each painting she pulls 
out of her stack. The stack is nearly as 
tall as she. 

"Roger and Anne use a very benign 
kind of authority," said one Yale stu-
dent who sits for Elizabeth. "She never 
seems aware of the fact that someone's 
saying no." 

Sweating blood 
When the English Department said 
"no" to Ferlo, he was planning to spend 
the next semester looking for a job. In-
stead, he found himself taking over the 
mammoth lecture course on Shake-
speare, originated by M arjorie Garber 
and A. Bartlett Giamatti. His reaction 
was understandable: "I was terrified. 
In a small seminar, you walk in with a 
sheet of paper. If you're teaching well 
that day, you get students to talk, 
manipulate them to come up with 
things they might not have thought of. 
But in a lecture, it's all you." 

His wife accompanied him to his 
first Shakespeare lecture, which drew a 
crowd that overflowed Linsly-Chit 
1 01. "He was sweating blood before-
hand," she said, "but when he got up to 
deliver the lecture, he just soared. 
Unlike me, he loves an audience - ! 
just have 
to drag him 
to 
the 
auditorium, and then he's line." 

Preparing for lectures was another 
story. "With fifty students, I can speak 
from notes," said Ferlo. "With 250, I 
have to write it out." T o his surprise, 
he produced 50 pages of lecture 
material each week, or 600 pages per 
term. "This was the guy with writer's 
block!" he said, laughing. The block 
persisted, however, in that he was 
unable to write without the spur of im-
mediate pressure. So Ferlo developed a 
routine for writing his lectures: he 
would go to bed at 7 p.m. the night 
before, wake up at four in the morn-
ing, type until 11:28, then dash to LC 
I 01. "I can't believe my wife put up 
with it," he said. At the end of the first 
term of Shakespeare, Ferlo had lost fif-
teen pounds. 

Many students remember those 
Shakespeare lectures with pleasure. 
"His lectures were incredibly com-
prehensive and comprehensible," said 
JE senior Amy Adels-:>n. "H e wasn't as 
self-absorbed as many English pro-
fessors are. He's interested in what he 
teaches, and that interest and insight 
are infectious." Clair Prestone, who was 
a TA for the course, agreed: "He 
always seems to have twice as many 
ideas as he has time for, but somehow 
he manages to fit them all in- and at a 
clip that's just slow enough to take 
notes at." But some students found 
Ferlo's lectures over-intellectual and 
difficult to follow. 

"I don't know 
whether it's a problem with Fcrlo or 
"I felt as if I were in the 
wrong business." 
with the English department," said one 
student. 

On the other side of the podium, 
Ferlo is uncomfortable with the lecture 
format. "If I had my choice, I would 
not lecture," he said. "I'm convinced 
that students don't know how to listen, 
that they're hostile to oral presentation. 
If I presented two ideas in a lecture, 
they wanted one idea over and over. 
Like my colleagues, I've had the ex-
perience of leaving a class and think-
ing, 'Why was I there?' There have 
been more moments like that than I 
wish there were." 

While Ferlo has experienced some 
u nsuccessful moments in his lectures, 
he has created many memorable ones 
for his students. His flamboyant man-
ner and dramatic style of reading made 
each 
lecture a 
performance. The 
charlatan-showman in Ferlo was in his 
element: Ferlo often read aloud from 
the plays in class acting out entire 
scenes. "The plays were meant to be 
listened to," he said. "That's what's fun 
about teaching Shakespeare. I could 
write a book based on my lectures, but 
who wants another book about Shake-
speare? I'd rather perform one of his 
plays." 

This highly theatrical approach re-
quired the familiar balancin~ act. Ferlo 
was determined to keep in its place 
what he calls "the staginess of the lec-
ture performance." When students ap-
plauded at the end of his first lecture, 
he said, "I felt as if I were in the wrong 
business." After his fifth lecture, he 
finally asked the class to stop ap-
plauding- the tightrope walker was 
losing his balance. '"The fact of ap-
plause is a significant action, and it 
drives me crazy," he explained. "A lee-
