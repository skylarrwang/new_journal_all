ate Secretary of the University is in 
charge of foreign student affairs. "But I 
don't have any evidence. We do know 
that Iran was heavily involved in stu-
dent 
surveillance 
in 
this country 
several years ago. This is certainly not 
of that magnitude." 

"Although we certainly don't en-
courage it, we couldn't do much to stop 
it," added Wilson. "The University has 
forms which foreign students can fill 
out so that we won't release their 
names. But, basically we just ignore 
the whole issue of other countries' 
politics being brought onto campus." 

"The Idea of one of us 
receiving money to report 
on a fellow student Is only 
an Insult." 

But not everyone agrees with this 
"common sense." T. P. Ma, an elec-
trical engineering professor and ad-
visor to the Chinese Student Service, 
adamantly denied that monitoring, in 
any form, Â·takes place. "Nothing like 
that happens here," said Ma. "I'm close 
to many of the Taiwanese students on 
campus. If anything was going on, I'd 
know about it. I don't know where the 
others have gotten their information." 

The case of Yang 
Amidst all this debate, Yang Huan-shi's 
arrest at the airport in Taipei and the 
implication of his son-in-law, John 
Shih, pose some serious questions. 
How did the KMT come to suspect 
John Shih in the first place? (Shih is 
not Taiwanese, but an American who 
married a Taiwanese student while 
they were both in graduate school 
here.) And how, if at aJI. does the 
KMT keep track of its 
nation's 
students who study in this country? 
The official party newspaper, Chung 
Yan Ri Pao in Taipei, reported on 
January 31 that during the trial the 
government presented evidence that 
John Shih had contacted people with 
.. special political leanings" while he was 
at Yale. This presumabl): was a 
reference 
to Chinese Communist 
agents. The KMT also originally 
charged that Shih had signed checks 
for $10.000 with money provided by 
these same Communist elements.
