EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The general philosophies of Yale, 
MIT, Harvard and Stanford are very 
similar. All believe that a regulated 
partnership 
between 
industry and 
academia will benefit society, and all 
place limits on the extent of any delay 
of the publication of information a corporation may impose on the university. 
Many professors here would cringe 
at any attempt to place Yale, the liberal 
arts 
institution 
rooted 
in 
the 
humanities, in the same league as 
MIT, the undisputed leader of technology transfers. When Yale professors, and sometimes administrators, 
discuss the University's effort to form a 
policy on university-corporate relations, they often point to MIT as an 
example of "what Yale doesn't want to 
become." In an interview with the Yale 
Daily News, Biology Professor Clement 
Markert, who heads a faculty committee 
on university-corporate relations, 
remarked that the role MIT plays in 
technological development is "not 
suitable for Yale." 

Despite similarities in stated principles, MIT 
and Yale differ considerably on a whole range of items 
from outward appearance to internal 
policies. While Yale's pseudo-gothic 
buildings bear the names of colonial 
heroes, MIT's campus is dotted with 
buildings donated by Exxon, Campbell Soup, Texas Instruments and 
George Eastman. Last year, Yale 
garnered approximately $3.4 million 
from industry, while MIT netted nearly $20 million. 

Living dangerously
Giamatti emphasizes caution and reflection as he helps formulate a policy 
which will guide Yale for the next few 
years. Many faculty members in the 
natural 
sciences, 
concerned about 
Yale's reputation in these disciplines, 
think that Yale is not aggressive 
enough in its dealings with industry. 
Even Markert, who has been described 
as one of the most cautious professors 
in the natural sciences when it comes to 
reaching out to industry, believes that 
Yale's administration is a bit too hesitant. 
"One does not construct a policy out 
of a referendum," responds Giamatti. 
"These principles are not meant to apply to just one segment of the University. 
I want principles which will apply 
to 
everything from 
philosophy to 
physics." 

MIT's administrators convey a different spirit. "We have an aggressive 
faculty," Stuart Cowen, Vice President 
for Financial Operations, commented. 
"They don't sit on their hands (when it 
comes to obtaining grants and contracts). You either live dangerously or 
conservatively. 
We've always been 
willing to take chances." 

In recent years, Warner and others 
have detected a more aggressive attitude among Yale's professors. "A 
growing number of faculty members in 
the sciences are now on the same wavelength as MIT with regard to taking 
risks," commented Warner. 

Warner cautions, however, that the 
risks involved when aggressively pursuing outside support can be substantial. Even an institution with a track 
record such as MIT's has been burned 
on occasion. In the early seventies, 
MIT 
created an interdepartmental 
Energy Laboratory with an emphasis 
on fossil fuels and energy conservation. 
During the energy crises and the 
Carter administration, the lab prospered. But the Reagan administration 
has shifted the emphasis away from 
conservation 
and 
towards 
nuclear 
energy. Consequently, 30-40 people 
linked with the lab were laid off last 
fall. 

In terms of corporate support, Yale 
not only lags behind such science-oriented universities as MIT; but 
universities such as Harvard and Stanford, closer in tenor to Yale, are also 
able to outstrip it in this regard. 
"Stanford's entrepreneurial spirit is 
impressive," said Warner. "There's no 
comparison (between Yale and Stanford) ... but I'm not sure some of the 
things they do would make sense here. 
There's a different environment, different faculty and different traditions." 
He mentioned that Yale is also 
limited by geography. 
Boston and 
Cambridge, for example have a much 
larger core of industries than New 
Haven. Stanford lies at the edge of 
California's Silicon Valley. 

Principles over profit
Many of Yale's strongest departments 
are ones which are the least likely to 
benefit from increases in research support. The social sciences, for example, 
have been hit hard by recent cutbacks 
in federal funding. They face little prospect of recovering their losses through 
grants and contracts from industry.


The humanities, which have never 
benefitted significantly from outside 
financing, face virtually no prospect of 
reaping any of the benefits of business's 
increased interest in universities. Departments such as engineering which 
have been affected the least by cutbacks during the Reagan administration have a much better prospect of 
securing grants or contracts from industry. 

In the strictest sense, however, universities do not "profit" from government 
or corporate research support. 
The grants are considered reimbursements for the cost of the research and 
often do not cover the entire cost. Yet 
these grants support graduate school 
students who 
serve 
as 
research 
assistants, and faculty members occasionally replace a portion of their 
university salaries with grant money. 
Overhead costs- ranging from heating 
bills and library upkeep to salaries for 
administrators- are also covered. 
These grants and contracts, therefore, 
contribute greatly to the size and 
growth of a university, especially at the 
graduate level. MIT, for example, 
continues to prosper and has grown 
almost without pause since World War 
II largely because of government and 
industry support. 

At a time when faculty members 
have voiced concerns over Yale's commitment to the physical sciences, 
Giamatti and Brainard say that Yale is 
striving to strengthen these departments. 

According to Giamatti, "It has been 
an active consideration and priority 
from my point of view and Provost 
Brainard's to do the most possible for 
the physical and natural sciences ... 
not because of any prior neglect but 
because it is vital to the health of the 
whole university, including the humanities." 

But Brainard stressed that Yale's 
renewed commitment to the sciences 
does not stem from a desire to attract 
more corporate and government dollars. "Yale became strong in the 
humanities and social sciences during a 
time when the federal government was 
pouring enormous amounts of money 
into the sciences," he commented. "I 
hope we can do more to strengthen the 
sciences, but Yale has not followed the 
market to determine emphasis in the 
past. Don't expect it to in the future."
