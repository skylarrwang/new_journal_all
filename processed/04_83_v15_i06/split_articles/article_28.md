**The Super-Shows**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
supershows held their auditions, an 
unprecedented four months before the 
spring productions were to open. And 
for good reason: Th~ Sp~~d needed to 
cast parts early so the writers could 
tailor the details of the script and lyrics 
to the specific actors. And Swunty Todd 
was an enormous undertaking that 
would require every minute it could 
get. In the early scramble for dramat 
sponsorhip and talent, there were a lot 
of hard feelings. Other productions felt 
that they couldn't compete for actors 
and production crews because so many 
people had drifted toward the super-
shows. "I think that both Th~ Spud and 
Sw~mty Todd sent shivers around Yale " 
said Freiman, "they were two excitin'g 
projects, and that's probably why there 
was some competition." 

"I think It's about all the 
campus can take." 

From the outset, the competition 
between the two shows was inevitable. 
Both would require an extraordinary 
amount of talent, ~nergy and money. 
The question seeMed to hang in the 
air: was there enough to go around? 
No one was placing any bets. Sw«nty 
was prepared to fold if it didn't get the 
singers it wanted. "We couldn't have 
done the show without excellent leads, 
because the music is on an almost 
operatic level," explained Freiman. 

But once auditions were over, it was 
evident that the talent was there. It was 
not impossible to cast two major 
musicals at the same time. "In a 
physical sense, there was competition," 
acknowled~d Loud. "But they got 
their people and we got ours." 

**Aesthetic Inconvenience**

When students in Ezra Stiles College 
~eturned from spring break, their din-
tng hall looked more like a construc-
tion site than a place to eat. One-by-
threes sliced through would-be meal 
conversations. 
Metal bars trapped 
students in their chairs. Half of the 
tables were placed under scaffolding 
platfonns, in the dark. But everyone 
found notes in their boxes to explain:

with its spring production of sw~mty

**Sweeney Todd**

supposedly murdered his customers 
and turned them into meat pies. It was 
the biggest show ever staged on Broad-
way, and it's the biggest show in Yale 
college theatre to date. "It doesn't 
dwarf Superstar," said Miguel Valenti, 
director of Sweeney Todd. "But it is big-
ger." Valenti said that he had wanted a 
show that was ambitious enough to risk 
jeopardizing his future career. "I love 
this show," he said, "I may fail out of 
law school, but it's worth it." 

Valenti couldn't have found a more 
ambitious project. Sweeney Todd has a 
$6000 budget, a cast of 37 and a 
30-piece orchestra. Before it closes on 
Sunday, it will have combined the 
labors of over 200 people. More than 
any other show, Sweeney Todd is a 
technical monster. It has employed 
some of the most detailed lighting and 
set design around, and in the process 
has brought together nearly every 
technical person on campus. "We pr-ob-
ably have the best electrics crew that's 
ever been assembled for an under-
graduate show," said Valenti. When he 
decided to do the show, Valenti 
knew that the technical end would be 
crucial to its success. "We're not trying 
to recreate Broadway," he said, "but 
you need to create the same atmos-
phere in which it was performed. You 
don't have to create it the same way, 
but you have to create that very special 
mood- hence Tom and Remie." 

Working together, lighting designer 
Remie Constable and set designer 
Tom McQuillen have tried to create 
the atmosphere that Valenti feels is so 
important. "The biggest problem is 
that the dining hall is too small to do it 
in," said McQuillen. "We had to create 
the illusion that there is a huge, expan-
sive space." Both designers worked 
toward this goal by suggesting that the 
stage has no concrete bounds. "We had 
this idea of very concrete to abstract-
not having the edges of the set any-
where," explained Constable. "My 
lights are intended in a lot of cases to 
be patchy and murky and obscure .. 
People will be walking in and out of 
shadow." 

McQuillen, an architecture major 
who is receiving academic credit for his 
desi~n work, has been working on the 
show since the fall semester. Part of his 
preparation included a 1: 24 scale 
model of the dining han and set. He 
designed and built the most intricate 
set pieces, such as Sweeney Todd's 
barber chair over the winter break, 
snipping them from Wisconsin by 
freight. He has also been keeping and 
training six white rats, which make an 
appearance in the show's graveyard 
scene. Obviously, this set involves


con ... ,n ....... 
lacks the vulgar implications of 'fast• ... 
more than building a few fancy plat-
forms: its style and effect have been 
carefully planned. 

"I'm trying to create a kind of in-
dustrial 
madness." explained Mc-
Quillen. "The way I understand the 
play, you have normal everyday life-
then suddenly people are getting baked 
into pies," said McQuillen. It is the 
sudden, shocking chan"ge of scale -the 
jump from ordinary to terrifying-that 
M cQuillen has tried to capture in his 
set clesi~n. "The thing that impressed 
me most was the play's sense of little 
tiny places versus huge. terrifying, 
awe-inspiring spaces," he said. Mc-
Quillen borrowed several loads of gar-
bage from a local junkyard and sus-
pended it from the roof struts and scaf-
folding to help create the eerie London 
atmosphere. 

Valenti has launched a show that is 
not only technically demanding, but 
that is demanding in terms of acting 
and music as well. To allow his cast to 
meet the challenge of Swmrry Todd, 
Valenti began his rehearsals as earl;. as 
January 16. teaching his actors skills 
that they otherwise might not acquire. 
.. 1 think you could liken it to a training 
program," said Valenti. "We've taught 
them dance, mime, improvisation and 
character work- we've even given 
them hand-outs on period informa-
tion. I'm really making the actors 
work. They are putting in a lot of time, 
~nd I want them to get something for 
lt." 


**The Speed**
**Page number(s): 44-45**

No Rodgers and Hammersteln 
Th~ Sp~~d was also an enormously com-
plex and time-consuming work-but 
in a way quite different 'from Swtmry 
Todd. The technical end of Th~ Sp~~d 
was quite simple. "There's a sort of 
lighting 
mafia ~ that seems to have 
gravitated 
towards 
sw~mry," Loud 
observed. "What I'm interested in is 
what has been written and not how we 
can light it beautifully. I've been trying 
to keep most of the show very abstract 
and clean to emphasize what is going 
on between the people." 

Th~ Spe~d is a new, l920s-Oavored, 
student-written musical based on the 
F. Scott Fitzgerald story "'A Nice Quiet 
Place." Composer Jon Ehrlich began 
working on the show a year and a half 
ago. Last spring he outlined the show 
with lyricist Dan Klotz and proposed 
the idea to director Da" id Loud and 
musical director Ted Sperling. 

Elizabeth Stauderman soon became 
the scriptwriter. Finally, at the end of 
the fall term, Midori Nakamurajoined 
as the show's choreographer, and a 
production crew was assembled. 

From the beginning, everyone took 
Th~ Sp«d seriously. There was no 
doubt that this was going to be a pro-
fessional undertaking. Unlike the pro-
duction staff of Swunry Todd, many of 
the people on the staff of Th~ sp~~d in-
tend to make theatre a career. Even in 
high school, Ehrlich had written and 
produced a full-scale musical. And 
Loud, who took ofT a semester last year 
to perform in the Broadway show Mu-
rily w~ Roll AIOTif!. has already had a 
taste of professional theatre. "'I think 
the show was an invaluable experience 
for all of us: said Sperling. "At the 
lowest level, the how w1ll be a body of 
work that we can <;how to other people. 
At least it will help us pre ent ourselves 
to other professionals."
