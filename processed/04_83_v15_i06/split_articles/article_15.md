Silent Dissent: 
Taiwanese Students at Yale 
Coordination Council for North 
American Affairs In Boston. 
When Yang Huan-shi stepped off the 
plane at Taipei's international airport 
on J anuary 5, government agents were 
waiting in the terminal. O nly minutes 
after he had returned from an exten-
ded stay in the United States, Yang 
found himself in the custody of the 
Garrison Command, Taiwan's major 
security service. The Command hus-
tled him from the airport and accused 
him of carrying funds destined for 
Communist forces on the Island. Yang 
was in fact carryin~ a large sum of 
money, $10,000 in checks signed by 
his son-in-law John Shih, a 1980 Yale 
Ph.D who now lives in New Jersey. 
While Yang told the agents that Shih 
had given him the money for personal 
expenses, the Command was con-
vinced that Shih had collaborated with 
Communist C hinese forces in the 
United States and had provided his 
father-in-law with money for subver-
sives in Taiwan. 


For some reason, the government 
didn't release the news of Yang's arrest 
for another two weeks, and, a month 
later, it had mysteriously dropped the 
most serious of the charges. The gov-
ernment (the Kuomintung or KMT) 
claimed that it had never heard of the 
$10,000. The KMT insisted that the 
newspapers had fabricated the whole 
idea of funds from Communist forces; 
the Yang incident was just another case 
of irresponsible journalism. No longer 
a state security threat, Yang was con-
victed by the KMT's military court of 
corresponding with Taiwanese Com-
munist agents in Mainland China and 
was only sentenced to three years of 
"re-education," a rigorous course in the 
works of Sun Yat-sen and Jiang•Kai-
shek. 

One month later, Denny Liang (a 
psuedonym) rested his elbows on the 
conference table in a college seminar 
room and asked the question which 
perplexed not only the 35 Taiwanese 
graduate students at Yale, but also the 
United States government: "How did 
the K MT know what John Shih had 
been doing at Yale?" Liang leaned for-
ward and answered his own question: 
"The KMT must have someone watch-
ing us on campus." 

Liang, a Taiwanese graduate stu-
dent here, is not alone in his suspic-
ions. A number of other Taiwanese at 
Yale-as many as a half dozen-have 
claimed that they cannot speak freely 
here. They believe that someone from 
the KMT will report on them, and that 
if they criticize the government they 
will risk endangering their families and 
their careers. In fact Newsweek, relying 
on these same anonymous sources, 
went so far as to claim quite definitive-
ly that there were three "student spies" 
~t Yale working for the KMT ("Spies 
m the Classroom" May 1 7, 1982). 

Recently Taiwanese at other univer-
sity have openly stepped forward. "I 
can promise you that surveillance goes 
on in every campus in the country, in-
cluding Yale," Lin Kuo-ching told The 
New journal. A graduate student at the 
University of North Carolina at Ra-
leigh, L in was involved in a contro-
versy over KMT surveillance last fall. 
"I know that I cannot go back to 
Taiwan safely. What more proof do 
you need?" 

Nor is this accusation without sup-
port from informed members of the 
Yale community. "It's an accepted 
assumption among those of us in the

Yale Taiwanese students: no one spealrs of "spies," rather 
of " monitors," "officers," or "agents." 

China field that surv'eillance takes 
place," said Mark Sheldon, Associate 
Director of the Yale-China Association, 
a non-profit organization involved in 
student exchanges between Yale and 
Mainland China. "Generally any loud 
apologist for the KMT is suspect, but I 
don't have any evidence that sur-
veillance goes on at Yale. It is a stan-
dard practice on other campuses I've 
been on, and I assume that it is here, 
too." Indeed, students have made ac-
cusations of monitoring on campuses 
around the country, such as MIT, 
Stanford, the University of Florida, 
U. C. Davis and the University of 
Chicago. 

An exercise In diplomacy 
Although other nations such as South 
Korea, Libya, Iran and the Philippines 
allegedly 
practice cameus su_rveil-
lance, Taiwan has without question 
received the most publicity for this ac-
tivity. There are approximately 20,000 
Taiwanese studying at universities 
around the country. At Yale, there are 
35 Taiwanese graduate students. Most 
of them are residents of the same 
dormitory, H elen Hadley Hall on 
Temple Street. Like the majority of 
Taiwanese students in this country, 
most of them at Yale are enrolled in the 
hard science or engineering depart-
ments. One of them is on leave from 
the defense ministry in Taipei studying 
chemical engineering. Many of them 
will return and enter Taiwan's boom-
ing free-market economy or its emerg-
ing defense industry. But some will 
probably remain in the States, receiv-
ing lucrative positions from U.S. in-
dustries. All of these students will say 
that they have never taken part in stu-
dent surveillance, and most will deny 
that any monitoring goes on at alL 

Then again, the controversy over 
KMT surveillance is a topic which few 
Taiwanese students here like to talk 
about. It is a loaded issue which easily 
lends itself to propaganda and misun-
derstanding. Ev~n phrasing the right 
question can be an exercise in diplo-
macy. No one speaks of"spies." Rather 
one delicately refers to "monitors," "of-
ficers" or at the very boundary of pro-
priety, "agents." The issue of 
surveillance goes well beyond ethical 
questions about academic freedom and 
the University's responsibility for the 
security of its foreig.n students. It also 
touches upon issues which are central 
to the existence of Taiwan. Questions 
of surveillance carry a host of political 
implications, both for Taiwan's inter-
national relations and for the Island's 
fragile internal affairs. Accusations of 
monitoring have jeopardized U.S. 
arms sales in the past and have stirred 
student unrest on the Island. In short, 
the debate over student monitoring at 
Yale 
provides 
a 
microcosm of 
Taiwanese politics 8,000 miles from 
Taipei. 

More than anything else, the KMT 
fears the Communist Chinese. But on 
U.S. campuses the KMT has had 
another worry: The Taiwanese In-
dependent Movement. An outlawed 
group in Taiwan, the Independent 
Movement is based primarily in Japan 
and the United States, and is dedicated 
to overthrowing the present govern-
ment on the Island. It seeks to establish 
an independent nation which is con-
trolled neither by the KMT nor the 
Communists. The Movement empha-
sizes the distinction between those on 
the Island who are descendents of 
native Taiwanese, as opposed to those 
who are descendents of the Mainland 
Chinese who emigrated to the lslan·d at 
the end of the civil war when the Com-
munists came to power in 1949. 

A $500 "stipend" 
Denny Liang insisted upon meeting in 
a college seminar room where no one 
would overhear. Liang asserted that 
there were two or three of his fellow 
Taiwanese students who would report 
him to the KMT if he made anti-
government statements. "The worst 
part," insisted Liang, "is that you never 
know if your criticisms of the govern-
ment have gone too far. You never 
know if they have reported you until 
an agent comes from the Garrison 
Command and visit<> your family 
warning them about your activities. 
Or worse, until you return to the 
Island and are refused a job because of 
the reports your employer has about 
you. I have a friend who graduated 
from the engineering school here, and 
his employer at first refused to hire 
him. He didn't understand why until 
he saw the employer's private file on 
him, which contained reports provided 
by KMT monitors at Yale."
