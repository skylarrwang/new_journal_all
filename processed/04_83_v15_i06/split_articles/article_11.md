"So tell me, Bruce, do they always have orgies 
on the beaches in Fort Lauderdale?" 
"No, sometimes they move into the hotels." 

It must have seem ed like strange 
dialogue coming in on路 the TV set, 
especially at 8 in the morning. There 
on the screen was NBC's Bryant 
Gumbel 
talking 
with 
two 
young 
gentlemen wearing goofy flowered 
shirts. The two guests on the Today 
show that March morning were talking 
from Florida about a project that has 
occupied much of their time since they 
graduated from Yale last May. They 
were two journalists who had come to 
America's breakfast table to culminate 
a promotional blitz for their recent 
book, The Rites of Spring: A Student's 
Guide to Sprin.e Break in Florida (Arbor 
H ouse, $4.95). 

Bruce Jacobsen, now a reporter for 
the M iami Herald, and Rollin Riggs, a 
photojournalist working 
in 
New 
H aven, are known throughout the land 
as experts-of a sort. Since J anuary 
they've been canvassing much of the 
East Coast and 
the 
Midwest, 
preaching the gospel of sun, surf and 
sex at universities from Chicago to 
Atlanta to Washington, D.C. They've 
done scores of TV appearances, radio 
talk shows, magazine interviews and 
autographing sessiou:s at bookstores 
throughout the country. 

Their 126-page guide to hot spots in 
the Sunshine State is the only book of 
its kind on the market, and, not sur-
prisingly, it has received a great deal of 
attention in the national press now that 
spring has arrived. Articles about the 
book have appeared in the Boston 
Globe, 
the Chicago 
Tribune, 
Washington Post, Time, Playboy, Seven-
teen, and Us, and stories have run over 
both the U P I and AP wire services. 

Whether people are buying it for its 
utility or simply for its novelty, The 
Rites of Spring is faring well by anyone's 
standards: the book has already sold 
over 20,000 copies and has gone into a 
second printing. Now, Jacobsen and 
Riggs are compiling research for an 
updated and revised second edition to 
appear in the fall.

Rollin Riggs and Bruce Jacobsen 
The Rites of Spring is aimed at the 
over 1.5 million college 路students who 
head for路 the Florida beaches every 
spring break with high libidos and low 
budgets. The guide tells you where the 
cheap bars are, how to pick up dates, 
how to move in a meatmarket, what to 
wear on the beach- that sort of thing. 
It tells you how to eat raw oysters and 
how not to sunburn. It explains how to 
avoid hangovers and the law. It is a 
book written by students, for students, 
and from page one it is unashamedly 
sophomoric. The preface announces 
that the book is dedicated, among 
other things, to "Mary Sue, for a 
wonderfut night in Daytona (good luck 
with cheerleading)." Says Playboy: 
"This is good advice on how to get 
what you're looking for during spring 
break in Florida. These guys have 
been there." 

Whether or not Jacobsen and Riggs 
have "been there," quite a few Florida 
residents say t~eir book is pure gar-
bage. "I think your book is the most 
April 8, 1983 
disgusting thi n g I've ever heard of," 
said one pertu rbed M iami resident 
during a phone-in radio talk show. "It 
should be banned." A number of 
public officials from some of the areas 
listed in the book- Fort Lauderdale in 
particular -have criticized Jacobsen 
and Riggs for inaccurately portraying 
their fair cities as hotbeds of vice and 
immorality. "Fort Lauderdale," reads 
the Rites of Spn路ng, "has as much dignity 
as pro wrestling or roller derby, but 
provokes the same illicit sense of 
pleasure ... As far as we can tell, 
there is no form of behavior considered 
unacceptable here." To that, Fort 
Lauderdale City Commissioner 
Virginia Young responded: "T hat's the 
sort of thing Yale students can be ex-
pected to write." 

"It's a dirty job," R iggs told Bryant 
Gumbel at the close of the Today show 
interview 
late March. " But 
somebody's got to do it."
