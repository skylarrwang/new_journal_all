EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Because everyone had such a per-
sonal stake in the project's success, 
making even a subtle alteration often 
involved a six-way debate. "It's very 
hard to be wrenching things around," 
said Loud. "It's for the good of the 
show, but it's still very hard. We all 
tend to get emotional about it. We all 
have such strong opinions about every 
little matter. It's frustrating, but I 
wouldn't have it any other way."


It was the very flexibility of The Speed 
that made it so difficult. Because it had 
never been done before, it could be 
done an infinite number of ways. "The 
fact that there _was_ the possibility of 
rewriting the script created a different 
attitude in working on the show," said 
Loud. "There was always the possibili-
ty of someone coming up with a better 
idea for a line. But I started with the 
idea of making the script work. Then 
when something absolutely did not 
work, we changed the script."


The remarkable thing about The 
Speed was the amount of persistence 
that was part of the creative process 
from the beginning. The title didn't 
just appear at the top of the completed 
script, but was the source of many 
hours of debate. Even still, it is a 
source of confusion for those who 
aren't familiar with the project. Loud 
sometimes found himself having to dis-
pel the misconception that The Speed is 
a musical about radicalism in the six-
ties. 
"I 
don't 
like 
the drug 
connotation," Loud admitted.


In the early months of production, 
the title changed regularly. Originally 
the writers of the play worked under 
the title of the Fitzgerald story, but 
they finally decided that "A Nice Quiet 
Place" was too sedate for a musical 
about a fast young woman named 
Josephine. The first title suggestions 
played off her name: "On Your Mark, 
Get Set, Jo," "Josephine Perry, Quite 
Contrary," "Speaking of Josephine," 
and simply "Josephine!" In less serious 
moments, the writers adapted titles of 
current Broadway shows, like "Joseph-
ine Babies," "Josephinita" and even 
"Sweeney Josephine." Finally they 
came up with "The Speed," one of 
those convenient words that, according 
to Fitzgerald, "lacks the vulgar im-
plications of 'fast'."


Creating The Speed was a process of 
teaching and learning, relaying and 
multiplying new ideas as the musical 
developed. What began as Ehrlich's 
private conception became more and 
more public property as work pro-
gressed. "Right now Jon and Dan and 
Elizabeth know everything about the 
show- it's theirs," Loud said several 
months ago. "As rehearsals start, I'm 
the one who has to know everything 
about it. Then the actors will know 
everything- they will know things I 
don't know. Then, finally the audience 
will know. It's a very satisfying pro-
cess- one that you don't get when you 
order Babes In Arms from Rodgers and 
Hammerstein." And when you order 
Babes In Arms you don't worry about 
whether or not it will make sense or 
how it will flow; you don't even have to 
wonder how it will sound. There were 
no recordings of _The Speed_ that the 
directors or singers could listen to for 
guidance. What guidance they did 
have wasn't immutable-everything 
was open to change.


Catch 22? 
Undeniably, 
both 
_The Speed_ and 
Sweeney Todd have challenged the quali-
ty of undergraduate theatre at Yale. 
But given what many see as a trend 
towards fewer, bigger, more expensive 
productions, the question should be 
asked: Does all theatre have to be on a 
huge professional scale simply because 
it's been shown that it can be? Some 
have said that theatre here is involving 
itself in a kind of Catch 22, in which 
each production crew that comes along 
feels a compulsion to up the ante. "It's 
hard for me to know where to go from 
here," said Freiman. When Superstar 
went up last spring, people squirmed. 
Was this the new standard of ex-
cellence? A year later, _The Speed_ and 
Sweeney Todd have pushed the standard 
up even higher.


The fact is that different shows lure 
different kinds of talent, and super-
shows 
thrive 
on 
a 
particularly 
masochistic strain of the theatre 
species. Valenti described the super-
show mentality best: "Our attitude's 
always been, 'this show can't be done, 
so let's go do it.'"
