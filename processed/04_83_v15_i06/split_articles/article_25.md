New Haven radio personality. "This 
isn't in terms of generating local musicians. but in terms of the quality and 
quantity of national acts that come 
through this area." 

New Haven Agora Ballroom booking
agent Buddy Henderson recalled a 
week when six major national acts 
played New Haven. "It was about the 
third month I was here (March 1982)," 
said Henderson, whose rock star looks 
-lithe frame, blue silk Agora jacket 
and shoulder-length gray-flecked locks 
-seem out of place bathed in the 
morning sunlight at a window table in 
the Brewery. "There was a week in 
town when: we had Talking Heads on 
Wednesday night, and Genesis was at 
the Coliseum the same night. On 
Thursday Toad's had Joe Jackson, on 
Friday and Saturday we had the B-52s, 
on Sunday we had the Clash, and on 
Monday Charlie Daniels was playing 
the Coliseum. That's a whole year's 
worth of entertainment where I come 
from in South Carolina, and those 
weren't cheap tickets. There wasn't a single 
ticket under ten dollars, and every 
show was sold out." Henderson added 
in his soft Southern twang. "If New 
Haven was in South Dakota you would 
never see a single band here, ever." 
Club owners attribute much of New 
Haven's edge to a potential market of 
22,000 college students. This, combined with a low state drinking age 
that allows students to drink at bars, 
makes for a club scene that outdoes far 
larger cities. Local businessmen feared 
revenues could shrink by as much as 70 
percent if Connecticut had raised its 
drinking age to 21. To fight the drinking 
age legislation, clubs and other 
music-
related businesses - bands, etc. - banded together to 
pay for a radio advertising blitz that 
asked somberly, "Where would you be 
if the drinking age was 21?" 

"Philadelphia, the fourth largest city 
in the U.S., has no drinking rock 
clubs, only concert halls that sell no 
liquor," explained WPLR General 
Manager Chris Kampmaier. "They 
have a few jazz clubs downtown, but 
nothing like a Toad's Place. People in 
their late twenties and thirties just 
don't spend money in clubs the way 
college-age people do." 

At least once a week, the three top 
directors of WPLR gather in the second floor of the station's unassuming 
beige brick building in a decaying area 
downtown. There, they decide which 
five or six songs to add to the playlist of 
the number one rock music station in 
New Haven. The plaques on the walls 
attest to the importance of the decisions being 
made: 
million-selling 
albums by bands as disparate as 
Labelle and Joan Jett 
and 
the 
Blackhearts, whose success PLR has 
fostered in the past. The decisions that 
these three men arrive at each week affect more than what goes over the air-
waves at 99.1 
megahertz in 
New 
Haven (and roughly 75 miles out in 
any direction). They also influence 
what goes on 
the stages of 
Haven's clubs and concert halls, in the 
display windows of Cutler's Record 
Shop, 
and, 
presumably, 
into 
record and tape collections of countless 
musical consumers. 

PLR - whose call letters originally 
stood 
for 
"Popular 99" - differs 
dramatically from other top rock stations in the way it makes programming 
decisions: a small in-house staff calls 
the shots. Since the mid-1970s, most 
top rock stations across the country 
have followed what is known as a 
"superstar" format. They pay market 
research consultants - superstars -
who do national studies and then compile formats and playlists which the affiliates follow like gospel, and which as 
many as 90 percent of non-affiliates 
mimic. "It's been the rage now for eight 
or ten years," said Kampmaier. "And 
it's responsible for giving you three or 
four stations in the same city all playing 
the same thing - stations that have 
been playing 'Stairway to Heaven' 
every two or three days for six years 
now."
