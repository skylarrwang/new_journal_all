**Title: Toxic splash?**
**Author: Anne Applebaum**
**Page number(s): 9**

While Jacobsen and Riggs were stir-
ring up some dirty business on na-
tional television, Yale crew was churn-
ing up some of their own. Along with 
the rigors of spring training, Yale crew 
tearr.s may have a new problem to con-
tend with: toxic waste. While the crews 
were rowing in Tampa ovP.r spring 
break, the Connecticut Departm.:-nt of 
Environmental Protection (DEP) iden-
tified a chemical waste dump in Derby, 
1.5 miles down the H ousaton ic River 
from the Yale boathouse. As of now, 
the D EP has found eleven whole bar-
rels containing chemicals; more wor-
risome is the undetermined number 
which are smashed and leaking. 

Environmentalists were surprised 
but not shocked by the discovery of 
toxic waste in the Housatonic. This 
area is one of the most industrially 
polluted regions in the country. The 
Federal governm en t has given Con-
necticut $100,000 in emergency funds 
to find out just how dangerous this par-
ticular site is and what can be done 
about it. Although environmentalists 
believe that the crew is not directly en-
dangered by this site because the waste 
is downstream from the practice area, 

DEP scientists are still unsure of how 
this site will affect the surrounding 
area. 

Without clear evidence of a health 
hazard, the coaches were not overly 
concerned. "We just row across the top 
of it," explained Dave Vogel, men's 
lightweight coach. "As long as it 
doesn't dissolve our shells, the water 
quality 
is not of great concern. 
Besides, it hasn't caught fire yet." H e 
added that most Eastern rivers where 
Yale competes are probably more 
polluted than the H ousatonic, pin-
pointing Columbia's H arlem River. 

M ost 
oarsmen 
weren't 
worried 
either. "Although I'm not very u pset 
about this particular incident, it is a lit-
tle scary to think that we are splashing 
that water all over our faces," said 
men's lightweight 
captain C harles 
McGlashen. 

The most disturbing aspect of this 
incident is that no one may be able to 
do anything about it. "More sites are 
being discovered daily," said Stephen 
H itchcock of the DEP . "The problem 
becomes one of priorities."

How about a thirteenth college? New 
buildings carefully designed and not 
overcrowded could add a new dimen-
sion to the residential college system. 
Don't get your hopes too high, because 
at best, this idea will be only one of a 
number of recommendations the Com-
mittee on the Future of the Residential 
Colleges will be making in its report to 
be released next week. 

"Overall the process has worked out 
much better than I had feared," com-
mented Professor Donald Kagan, the 
committee's chairman. "We've become 
a kind of family, this committee of 
ours. We've found the whole process 
v~ry worthwhile, and hopefully others 
Will lind it so." Since we last reported 
on the Kagan Committee members ("A 
Look at 
Residential 
College 
System," TNJ December 1, 1982) they 
have completed all their research and 
are in the process of linish:>lg up their 
report to the President. "I think we're 
going to come out with some fairly pro-
vocative things," said Kagan. "And I 
think that is good. We have got to 
make the university stop and thi~k 
about some of these issues and make a 
plan to handle them in the future." 

In addition tO calling for an end to 
the present overcrowding in the col-
leges, the committee will call for 
substantial changes in the roles of the 
college fellows and masters. "Most of 
the recommendations hinge on our 
belief that the colleges have to play a 
larger educational- not just academic 
-role in the future," Kagan explained 
to a Yale College Council Forum two 
weeks ago. 

What effect will the report have on 
the future of the residential college 
system? "Well, we think we are .making 
recommendations for the Pres1dent of 
Yale," said Kagan. "We think we have 
no power to actually make changes, 
and we are delighted by that.~ 


**Title: The survivors confer**
**Author: Andy Court**

Leon Weinberg was one of the first 
holocaust survivors to contribute his 
experiences to the collt>ction of over 
250 tapes in Yale's Videoarchive for 
Survivor T estimony ("The survivors 
speak," TNJ, January 21, 1983). Now 
at the American Gathering of Jewish 
Holocaust Survivors in Washington 
next week. Weinberg will make a sim-
ple but expensive gesture. 

Weinberg is co-owner of a frozen 
dough business in Hamden and a sur-
vivor of the Lodz ghetto in Poland. 
"The only thought in them days was 
hunger," Mr. Weinberg said during 
his videotaping session two years ago. 
Now for a gathering of people who 
knew the same suffering, Weinberg is 
baking thousands of loaves of bread to 
be distributed at the final ceremony. 

At first he had expected to bake 
about 3,000 loaves, but registration for 
the conference has already reached 
10,000. including 85 survivors from 
the New Haven area. 

Laurel Vlock, co-founder of the vid-
eoarchive. will be one of those in at-
tendance. She will co-host a televised 
report on the conference for PBS on 
April 13 at 10 p.m. In addition, she 
will film three survivors at the con-
ference, show several tapes from the 
archive and run a seminar about the 
project in order to get more survivors 
involved. 

Meanwhile, in New Haven this 
Sunday, 
Holocaust Remembrance 
Day. Yale Professor Annette lnsdorf 
will speak at a service at the Holocaust 
Memorial in Ede-ewood Park. 

Vlock expects some poignant mo-
ments at the Washington conference. 
With the help of an improved com-
puter indexing system. survivors will 
now be able to look up the names of 
relatives and friends who might be at-
tending the conference. As for Mr. 
Weinberg. he expects to spend about 
$6,000 on his own gesture. "In the 
ghetto, we used to eat black, hard 
bread," he said. "Ali i wanted was to let 
people know the bread was gi'>Â·en to 
them by a fellow survivor."
