PLR's Kampmaler: "We're not the only game. In town. It's 
just too easy to change the channel." 
Buy an album at Cutler's Record 
Shop, and it will come in a bag with a 
WPL R logo on it. Turn on WPLR and 
within an hour or so you'll hear a pro-
motion for a concert at Toad's Place or 
the Agora Ballroom, possibly mention-
ing that PLR is sponsoring the show. 
Check out the show and, while waiting 
for the band to arrive onstage, you can 
watch 
Music Television (MTV), 
cable's rock 'n' roll channel, on a giant 
silver screen. On your way home, take 
a look in Cutler's and chances are you'll 
find the display window plastered with 
copies of the newest release by the 
band you just saw. 
Yes, Virginia, rock 'n 
roll is a 
business. It is a business that feeds off 
itself, where one hand washes the 
other- and perhaps in no city is this 
more true than 
ew Haven. The city 
has a 
well-coordinated network of 
al{ents, salesmen and promoters whose 
job is to keep the business movinl{ 
along. The musical bandwagon in 
ew H aven operates by what has been 
called the "triangle theory:" a belief 
among businessmen that at least three 
separate signals are 
needed 
to 
penetrate the market and spur the 
musical consumer to plunk down seven 
or eight dollars for a record album or 
show ticket. "One of us can't exist 
without the other," said Lucy Sabini of 
Toad's Place, referring to the other 
clubs, •·adio stations and record stores 
whose promotional efforts comprise 
New Haven's musical nexus. 
The players in 
ew Haven's music 
business have to be coordinated to 
profit off the city's unique location. It 
might seem strange that New Haven, a 
city slightly smaller than Peoria, Il-
linois, has one of the liveliest concert 
scenes in the country. New H aven's 
status on the rock 'n' roll map is 
disproportionate to the city's popula-
tion size primarily because it's the 
logical stopover hetween 
ew York 
and Boston. Bands touring either or 
both of those towns generally book a 
gig in Connecticut, either to warm up 
for a show in the city or just to pick up 
some extra money on the way to some-
place else. And while Hartford's Civic 
Center and 
the 
H artford 
Agora 
Ballroom attract big names to the state 
capital, New Haven does even better. 
"The two hottest musical cemers in the 
country, without a doubt, are New 
York and L.A.- but New H aven 
could well be number three," said one
