HELPING ALICE 
If you came here to watch someone die, 
you came to the right place. If you came 
here to help, grab a pair of gloves. 

"I'm a mess today," Alice calls as you enter her home. Blinds up. Heated bathroom 
light on. Pants, sweater, blouse, camisole, 
underwear (lined with a day pad), wool 
socks: lay them on top of the washing machine in the bathroom. Place the walker at 
the bedside and scoop up a pair of speckled legs thinner than your forearm. After 
a five minute routine of ankle circles (to 
get circulation going), help walk Alice to 
the bathroom, left hand on the small of 
her back, right hand cupping her shoulder 
bone. Sit her on the toilet. Shut bathroom 
door or risk Alice complaining, "You're 
showing me to the road!" At ninety-eight 
Alice still has spunk. 

If you see her dentures, soak them in 
water. Place her wristwatch and chest 
monitor on the counter, discard her diaper 
in the trash, tie the trash bag and leave it 
outside. Get the shower water running. 
Wash her back, underarms, stomach, 
legs while she's sitting. She'll wash her face. 
Stand her and wash her bottom thoroughly," instructs Colleen Swiderski, one of Alice's four attendants and a certified home-help aid. She explains the job as you go 
through the motions. This is hospice care, 
a philosophy of emotional and physical 
treatment aimed at the comfort of the patient at the end of her life. It is not to keep 
her from dying. It is to make the transition from life to death kinder and easier. 
Alice is treated from home. Her bottom is 
chapped a dark red. Scrub lightly. 

"Don't be afraid to touch me," Alice 
says. Scrub harder. When her arms start to 
shake, she's tired. Water off, towels on: one 
draped over her back, one across her legs. 
Lather Sween Moisturizing Body Cream 
on the raw skin on her bottom. Then: 

Underwear up. Camisole down. Pants up. 
Blouse down. Left sock up. Sweater down. 
Right sock up. Done. If you found them 
earlier, apply Super Polygrip to dentures 
and give them to Alice on a small washcloth. If you hadn't found them on the 
counter to soak, Alice still has them in 
from the night before. Though she risks 
swallowing them in her sleep when she 
does this, don't say a word. 

Never question Alice's ability to make 
decisions for herself. Don't argue if Alice 
wants to keep her dentures in so she can 
nibble on the chocolates on her bedside 
table during the night. Don't get frustrated 
when patients want to take control, even if 
it interferes with your job. 

After the shower routine (don't forget 
the hearing aid or the glasses), help her to 
the reclining blue chair beside the glass 
paneled doors looking out over the ocean. 
Listen when Alice says "That's our 
rock." She points out the window to a 
rock jutting out of the surf. Nod to tell 
her 'what a nice rock.' Alice explains that 
when she was a middle school teacher, her 
classroom was so quiet that people used to 
joke that she hypnotized her students. Believe it as you feel that silence descending 
over the sun-drenched house. Pause, just 
for a minute. If you came here to watch 
someone die, you couldn't have come to a 
more beautiful place. 

Never think about the fact you're 
working hospice care. Don't dwell on the 
stories Colleen told you about the patient 
who bled out of his mouth, or the patient 
who died in her arms, or the patient after patient who soiled the bed night after 
night. 

Still, remember your job. Practice how 
to fasten the orange "Do Not Resuscitate" 
bracelet, pinned to the phone beside the 
elderly woman's reclining chair, around 
her quarter-inch thick wrist. Worry that 
it seems like Alice's family, as Colleen tells 
you, is "just waiting for her to die." Examine the evidence: they never buy her 
new nightgowns. And they only come by 
to say 'hey Morn' and borrow her copy of 
the New Haven Register. "You'll see that," 
Colleen warns. 

Don't panic or call the hospital if something goes wrong. Fasten the bracelet tight 
around her wrist and call the family. Let 
her die: that's your job description. Then 
again, even Alice will readily admit that no 
one wants to live until she's ninety-eight. 

When her legs shake in the shower, or 
when she leans back into your arms and 
waits nervously for you to lift her into bed, 
she knows how little is within her control. 

Bring her one cup instant coffee, one 
slice of toast (cut diagonally in fourths), 
eight to twelve Frosted Mini-Wheats. Remember: separate spoons for the coffee, 
jam, and cereal. Don't pour the milk or the 
coffee creamer. She'll do that herself.
