Iraqi refugees living in New Haven face difficulty finding work, homes, and even 
getting picked up at the airport. Two organizations want that to change. 

You MAY KNOW LITTLE Aoo1s Ababa 
in Washington, D.C. or the Little Arme-
nia of Los Angeles (otherwise known as 
the city of Glendale), but you probably 
haven't thought of New Haven as a Little 
Baghdad. Over the last three years, how-
ever, approximately 180 Iraqis have arrived 
in New Haven 
now considered an "Iraqi 
location" by the State Department 
as the 
United States has finally begun to address 
the refugee crisis it helped create. 

Hussain, an Iraqi refu_gee living in New 
Haven, waited a year and a half for his 
case to be processed by the United Na-
tions High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) before he was invited to come 
to the US. It was not his first time in the 
States 
he studied at the University of Ar-
kansas as a Fulbright Scholar from 2005 
to 2007 
but he, like most other arriving 
refugees, had never heard of New Haven. 
"I Googled 'New Haven' to read about 
New Haven and Yale, and I started having 
some dreams about whether I would be 
happy here or not," recalls Hussain. 

Hussain is now employed as a case-
worker, Arabic interpreter, and cultural 
advisor at New Haven's Integrated Refugee 
and Immigrant Services, more commonly 
known by its acronym, IRIS. One of many 
non-profit 
resettlement 
organizations 
around the country, IRIS assists newly ar-
rived refugees once the State Department 
assigns them to the New Haven area. The 
group provides airport pick-up services, 
health and employment advising, school 
registration and language classes, and re-
ferrals to the government's public benefit 
programs. IRIS supports families as they 
work to become self-sufficient 
a process 
that can take up to a year, and is only made 
harder by the fact that these families only 
receive $900 of federal support. 

The 2003 invasion of Iraq left as many 
as two million Iraqi refugees living in the 
Middle East, and 2:7 million more re-
main displaced within their own country. 
Despite these alarming numbers, the US 
made no move to address the situation 
until 2006. The work was slow. Congress 
passed the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act in January 2006 to provide for 
fifty special immigrant visas (SNs) per 
year for Iraqis or Mghanis translators who 
aided US forces while in Iraq. From the 
beginning of the war to September 2007, 
despite Congressional hearings on the 
worsening predicament, the US approved 
only 2,371 Iraqi refugees for admission. 
"There was an embarrassing, shameful 
delay in the resettling of [Iraqi] refugees," 
says Chris George, Executive Director of 
IRIS. 

Only in the last few years has the situ-
ation begun to amend itself. In January 
2008, the Refugee Crisis in Iraq Act of 
2007 (the Kennedy Act) provided 5,000 
SNs per year for five years, and also ini-
tiated expansive refugee resettlement pro-
grams. By September of that year, the US 
announced it had admitted 13,823 Iraqi 
refugees, and by July 2009, twenty-thou-
sand Iraqis had been allowed to enter the 
United States. 

Now, there is a small, growing Iraqi 
community in New Haven. "People here 
take pride in the idea of 'strength through 
diversity,"' George continued. "The Elm 
City 10 Card, especially, sent a loud mes-
sage that immigrants and refugees are wel-
come here." 

Yale students are doing what they can to 
help refugees. At the undergraduate level, 
the student group Reach Out has started a 
new initiative this fall to work with refu-
gees through IRIS and shine a spotlight 
on New Haven's growing immigrant com-
munity. Additionally, two Yale Law School 
students, Becca Heller LAW '10 and Jon 
Finer LAW '09 founded the Iraqi Refugee 
Assistance Project (IRAP) last summer.
