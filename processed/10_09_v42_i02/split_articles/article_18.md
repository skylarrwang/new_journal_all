THE POCKET PARK on the corner of
Chapel and Orange seems more like a
concrete wasteland than an art gallery.
The gravel entrance gives way to unkempt
patches of green and yellow grass. Flanked
on three sides by a large brick wall, the area
is dark even when the sun is out. The air is
thick with the dust of nearby construction,
and the park provides no shelter from the
sounds of the street just a few feet away. Â·
But then, there it is: a large, old-school
basketball hoop atop a wooden pole. The
rim is rusty, fading from red to crusty
brown, and the net is worn and dirty from
overuse.
There's really nothing unusual
about the equipment, except that it is

hoop you've ever seen.
rim is also 2.5 times larger than a normal
hoop, the worn-down blue basketball pro-
vided on-site should be at least six times
more likely to go in. Even knowing that
probability, the prospect of tossing a ball

task: I have to get it in, and I'll stay until
I do. The stares of the people waiting at
the bus stop or working at the construc-
tion site nearby no longer embarrassed
me. I might have looked goofy, but I was
having a lot of fun. Occasionally, people
came over to see what the ruckus was all
about. "Even Shaq can't dunk that," one
exclaimed. And once they see the hoop,
they're hooked; no one who takes a shot
leaves without scoring. While few are ac-
tually children, everyone looks like a pre-
schooler when they shoot.
