sort!' But then I catch mysel£
Before
she had started to read me, I had asked
Petry if I could record our conversation
as I planned to write something about it.
I wonder what she would have predicted
without that vital information. I watch her
as she purses her meticulously lined lips,
and strokes her chin with a red acrylic nail
as long as the crystal she holds in her other
palm "for clarity." Would she have proph-
esized I would go into banking if a copy of
the Wall Street journal were poking out of
my backpack instead of The New Yorker?
Flip.

Petry tells me that she didn't use her
abilities in a professional capacity · until
very recently. It is hardly acceptable in the
accounting world to record "predicted"
assets and liabilities. Then two and a half
years ago, Petry got tired of "pushing the
pencil"- a development even a non-psy-
chic might have foreseen - and started a
new career in the slightly less conventional
field of selling angel and fairy memora-
bilia.

Despite its "less than whimsical location
in a suburban shopping center in Harn-
den, Petry's boutique, Gifts by Moon-
light, might have popped out of a Hans
Christian Anderson tale . . The walls depict
pastel fairies and butterflies flitting across
a starry, saccharine-peach sky, their fair
hair cascading behind them. Fairy mobiles
hang from the ceiling above tables full of
crystal angels and jars of vanilla perfume.
A wind chime tinkles faintly at the store's
entrance, evoking someone's idea of what
fairy laughter might sound like.
"I just wanted to do something fun,"
Petry explains.

For a while, Petry's fuzzy pink pouches
and ornate -angel stationary flew off the
shelves. However, when the economy
soured last year, angels and fairies dropped
off consumers' must-have lists. Petry's
business plummeted from profitability like
Lucifer from heaven.
"I figured I needed to add a service to
boost business and I thought: 'I like read-
ing people, why not?"'

Petry reads me in a sectioned-off area
in the back of her store. The space is not
dark or mysterious, and I am slightly dis-
appointed to see that there are no crystal
balls, red velvet tablecloths, or vials of
bubbling potion. I suppose, though, that
finding those items would make Petry
one of the abrasively mystical readers I'm
supposed to watch out for. Instead, Pet-
ry's reading space is cheerful with lots of
light and windows that look out on a lush
backyard. A lone candle {vanilla scented)
and the ticking timer sit atop a minimalist
wooden table.

Three swords impale a rose-red heart
that floats in a tempestuous sky.
"Hmm the three of swords," Petry
pauses. "Is there something going on with
your mother?" Well, that's not vague at all.
"Your mother is going to want you to come
home. for something. Don't worry, it's
nothing bad!" I tltink a heart with swords
run through it looks pretty bad. "She's just
going to want you to come home."

Suddenly, the timer beeps, indicating
that my twenty minutes are up.
''Anything else you want to ask real
quick?" Petry offers. I shake my head no.
As I thank her, we make eye contact which
both of us hold for slightly too long, read-
ing one another.
"I'm very accurate,
she volunteers.
"No body's 1 OOo/o with these things. I am
human after all."
