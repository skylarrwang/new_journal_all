DRIVING IN CIRCLES 
6 
Professor of Management at Yale, explains 
that the city's plan was "very rare for that 
period." 

Two hundred years after the 
grid was first set down, the automobile 
made its debut, and with it came congestion. By the 1960s, in an effort to calm 
traffic, the city made most of the streets 
downtown one-way, an arrangement that 
has persisted to the present day. This design, Rae said, is meant to speed up car 
traffic. "Traffic moves in New Haven now 
maybe twice or even three times as fast 
as it did seventy years ago," he said. City 
Engineer Richard Miller, for one, thinks 
it's been relatively successful. "I don't receive many complaints about the one-way 
streets," he said. 

But the one-way streets can annoy 
anyone in a car used to walking by more 
direct routes. To get from Phelps Gate to 
Broadway, for example, Joyner must drive 
four blocks out of his way. "Customers get 
upset because they think I'm taking them 
for a ride," he said. "In some instances, it's 
quicker to walk." 

Though he now lives in Stratford, Joyner, 49, grew up in New Haven. 
"When I got my license, people drove with 
a little more courtesy," he said. Though 
the layouts of the streets haven't changed, 
"traffic is ten times as much as it was when 
I was younger." 

Joyner's stint as a New Haven cabbie 
began about a month ago. Before that, he 
drove in Milford and Bridgeport, where 
two-way streets and free parking abound. 

"New Haven is pretty unfriendly to the automobile," Rae said. "The 
really vital thing about New Haven is that 
the downtown and Yale neighborhoods 
center on pedestrians, and, to a lesser extent, bicycles." 

According to Miller, there are an increasing number of cyclists in the city, a 
fact he attributes to the resurgence of the 
green movement and the heavy concentration of schools in the downtown area. Yet 
there are few bike lanes on New Haven's 
streets and biking on the sidewalk is illegal, 
so cyclists, like Brian Tang, TD '12, have 
to ride next to cars. 

Tang, a former intern with the New 
Haven Transportation, Traffic and Parking 
Department, says that, "From the perspective of a Yale student, it feels like somebody should be making an effort to make 
things safer for Yale's campus and to make 
it easier" for bicyclists to get around safely. 
It's the duty of a city to protect its citizens 
and facilitate transportation. Bicyclists, 
however, aren't always playing by the rules 
either. 

Though bicyclists are supposed to 
obey traffic signals just as cars do, many 
often cross the street with pedestrians instead of waiting for a green light. Moreover, in an effort to avoid the same indirect 
routing drivers face, cyclists often go the 
wrong way down one-way streets. The 
problem becomes particularly acute on 
smaller, single-direction roads not intended for through-traffic, such as Wall Street, 
whose direction switches every couple of 
blocks. 

In an effort to reconcile the needs 
of drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians, the 
city is working on compiling a Complete 
Streets Manual, to be finished by the end 
of the year. The pamphlet will assess the 
conditions and usage patterns of every 
street in New Haven. "We're looking at 
trying to be much more aware of the context" to determine how to address traffic 
needs on each street, Miller said. He stresses that many forms of technology for traffic control have already been developed; 
the city only needs the money and time to 
implement the new ideas. 

For now, people like Joyner and 
Tang try to adapt to the idiosyncrasies of 
New Haven's streets. Perhaps in time, the 
city will realize the need to adapt to them 
instead.
