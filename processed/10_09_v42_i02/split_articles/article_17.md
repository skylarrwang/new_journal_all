--Elizabeth Alexander YC'84
Poet, Chair of Mrican-American Studies at Yale University

By the time Elizabeth Alexander matriculated at Yale in 1980,
a shift both cultural and political was taking place across the coun-
try, as well as on campus. Alexander . remembers watching from
the Morse Dining Hall as Reagan was elected in the fall of her
freshman year. The role of being an active participant in politics
had shifted from protestor to witness, from acting to watching.
Alexander remembers her freshman year as being both historically
important and radical. According to her, it was "a brief and won-
derful period after the sexual revolution and before the AJDS epi-
demic ... It was very powerful to be eighteen and feeling that being
sexually free was part of being an intellectual and of being politi-
cal." It was a short-lived but incredible time to be a woman. Dis-
course on the roles and rights of women at Yale pervaded campus .
Being empowered to talk privately about current situations was no
longer enough; the critical voice had made it, not only into the
culture but into to the classroom, too. It was the foundation of
the work being conducted inside the university and on its grounds
as well. "In the classroom, in the academy, it was very present,
very real." There was a self-determined ideal: a watermark, a goal
for where women should be and how they should be received.
The women's role at Yale felt to Alexander like a challenge, but
one that was unstable. «.We were called upon to do our best and
better." Between 1984 and 2009, that feeling, says Alexander, has
evaporated. Speaking about the Yale of today as both an alumnus
and a professor active in student life, Alexander addressed a shift
away from classroom-based political discussions. Whereas stud-
ies of old movements are the norm, it is rare that a class diverts
away from a syllabus to talk about campus dynamics. "Change
is not made by slackers," she remarks. Yet today's Yale women are
far from slacking. As with our men, the women ofYale are highly
pressured, and highly motivated, and often wildly dedicated. So
why, then, aren't they making change? _
At first glance, it seems that there is less at stake. Thought
about women and change at Yale is no longer based in impera-
tives, but suggested in terms of additions, improvements, and
patches. It's true
today, few could imagine the college without
female students, let alone our female professors and staff. This
comfort, however, may prove a different challenge. Today's Yale
must be aware of the quieter hurts, based on gender and insidious
strains of sexism that still riddle the campus. The newer genera-
tions must look with sharper _eyes.

Rachel Kauder Nalebuff, SM '13 was disgusted at Yale's reac- .
tion to the "preseason scouting report," an anonymous email pro-
filing 53 incoming freshman women. The women were rated on a
scale from sober to ten beers, the more sober, of course, being the
more desirable. The review often got personal, even citing specific
Facebook pictures, as if these women really had been scouted by
the students before they arrived.
"I was surprised that no real action was taken .. .! think we need
better sexual education," Kauder Nalebuff says. "People do not
know basic, fundamental things that people interacting with other
people really need to know. Things like sexual etiquette."
What needs to change for women to feel not only equal, but
comfortable in this community? Why is it that our student body
needs to be educated about how to cope with being co-educated?
What happened in the 40 years since women first entered Yale?
The sense of entitlement to co-education on the collegiate level
is understandable. It is a choice, and one seldom made, to be edu-
cated in a single sex environment. Of course women feel entitled
to be at Yale. Who would ever reverse that decision?
But it's not enough, perhaps, to say that if men and women
~ both get x, we have equality. Is it then ridiculous to want to firm
a deeper sensibility, not just actions but perceptions? The hour
does not feel as though it has come to do more than talk privately
about our discontent. Or has it? Perhaps we as Yale women and
as women in general should put those questions from the past 40
years back on the table.
