of the Iraqi refugee crisis while he was 
reporting . in Jordan for the Washington 
Post, the organization quickly grew, and 
now boasts chapters at New York Univer-
sity Law School and UC Berkeley's Boalt 
School of Law. Additionally, it has gained 
support among law students drawn to the 
refugee crisis as "a great injustice that we 
· caused and weren't doing anything about," 
as IRAP Director of Direct Assistance Kate 
Brubacher LAW '10 explained. 

c'I always tell people, , says 
' 
Hussain, "that if one Iraqi 
· man P'!-1-ts his hands on the 
shoulders o ·another Iraqi 
man, they are not homosexu-
als. This is simply our custom. " 

Still entirely student-run, IRAP has a 
three-pronged mission: to work directly in 
the Middle East resettling· refugees, to ad-
vocate for refugees through United States 
policy reforni, and to provide direct servic-
es to refugees here in New Haven as they 
adjust to American life. Since the New 
Haven-based IRIS has limited staff to ad-
. 
dress the needs of each newly-arrived Iraqi 
·family, IRAP provides student volunteers 
to help refugees with a variety of services, 
from teaching individuals about tenant 
rights to tutoring English to personally ac-
companying men and women to job inter-
views around the city. 

This year, IRAP is opening volunteer 
opportunities up to undergraduates as 
well. An IRAP undergraduate informa-
tion meeting at the end of September 
lured a large number of interested Yalies 
to donate their time to the cause. IRAP 
hopes to convince student organizations 
on campus to sponsor individual families 
and to promote an awareness campaign 
on the Iraqi refugee crisis. Undergraduates 
will also have opportunities to work on 
policy teams that make recommendations 
to Washington. "You should simultane-
ously be a resource and an advocate," en-
couraged Brubacher at the meeting. "The 
Law School is incredibly connected," said 
Michael Boyce BR '11, who worked with 
IRAP in their local legal assistance divi-
sion during a semester abroad in Jordan. 
He currently helps lead the undergraduate 
branch of IRAP. "You're not just sending 
things out into the ether. Your sugges-
tions are heard. It's amazing what you can 
accomplish," Boyce said in reference to 
!RAP's policy advocacy division. 

The aid of the students involved is not 
lost on a struggling local community. Even 
before arriving in the United States, many 
Iraqi refugees have to put their lives on 
hold for several years while they muddle 
through the complicated application pro-
cess. Unaware of the status ·of their peti-
tion, they subsist on very little income as 
a result of being forced to live in countries 
like Jordan, where it is illegal for refugees 
to work. Despite having surmounted in-
credible obstacles in order to arrive in the 
US, refugees do not see resettlement in 
New Haven as the light at the end of the 
tunnel. Rather, those arriving in the city 
face a host of new setbacks. 

One problem arriving Iraqi refugees 
face in New Haven is the task of finding 
jobs that match their professional qualifi-
cations. As a particularly highly-educated 
group of refugees, Iraqis "come with quali-
fications that are not to be considered 
here, so they have to re-credentialize their 
degrees," explained H·ussain. "We think to 
ourselves, 'We are a ready-to-go people. 
The United States didn't spend a penny on 
our education 
why not benefit from it 
by employing us in professional fields?"' 
A Baghdad oncologist Hussain worked 
with at IRIS, for example, could not find 
a medical job here, and now works in a 
meat service department.· "Iraqis waiting 
to come to the U.S. in Jordan are con-
vinced that they will get better jobs here 
than they actually will," echoed Boyce. 
"They all plan on making $75,000 a year 
before they get here, but these kinds of op-
portunities don't materialize." 

The struggle to find jobs is augmented 
by what Hussain calls the "general igno-
rance" of employers towards the refugee 
resettlement program. "People think that 
refugees have no paperwork," he explained, 
"when in fact we are the most documented 
people." 

Finally, the culture shock New Haven 
poses to Iraqi refugees is significant. "We 
come from a patriarchy, a system where 
the man is the dominating character in 
the family," explained Hussain. "Here, this 
is different. Women participate in deci-
sions." The implications of this culture 
gap are broad. For example, an elementary 
school may call the home of an Iraqi refu-
gee family to arrange for a parent-teacher 
conference, only to be told by the husband 
that he will show up to the meeting, but 
that his wife 
who should be kept at 
home 
will not be present. In other in-
stances, some Iraqi customs don't translate 
into American society. "I always tell peo-
ple," says Hussain, "that if one Iraqi man 
puts his hands on the shoulders of another 
Iraqi man, they are not homosexuals. This 
is simply our custom." Additionally, many 
facets of our everyday lives 
ATM ma-
chines, credit cards, and mortgages 
are 
unheard of in much of Iraq, and must be 
explained to newly arrived refugees. 

New Haven's growing Iraqi refugee 
population brings the Iraq War home in 
the truest sense of the expression. "Iraqis 
are good people. Refugees are good peo-
ple," said Hussain. "They need chances, 
jobs 
they need to feel somehow that life 
is better here for them." With the privilege 
of living in a society thaf'enables refugees 
to rese.ttle comes the responsibility to ac-
cept and promote them as members of 
our community. If refugees arrive in New 
Haven only to feel that life here is a dis-
appointment compared to the countries 
from which they fled, then ·the city has 
failed to live up to its name.
