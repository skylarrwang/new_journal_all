DEAD ON ARRIVAL 
Every Tuesday and Thursday, seventeen-year-old Zoe Kauder Nalebuff waits 
in line behind a gaggle of schoolchildren 
in the lobby of the Peabody Museum of 
Natural History. She is not going to see 
the dinosaurs. When Zoe reaches the 
front, she makes eye contact with a security guard, who steps out from behind 
the admissions desk and escorts her to a 
locked door which he sweeps open with 
the ceremony of a chauffeur. Zoe descends 
two flights of an echoing cement staircase 
and emerges beneath the Peabody, where 
strips of fluorescent lights and exposed 
piping stretch down a network of hallways 
lined with windowless doors. The signage 
is troubling. The "Pest Control Orange 
Zone" gives way to a corridor flanked with 
an "Emergency Shower Unit" and cabinets labeled "Dirty Bones." Chain-link 
doors segment the hallway like security 
checkpoints and require the repeated use 
of a key. Behind a sliding steel door, secured with a clunky steel padlock, is the 
museum's taxidermy and modeling studio. 
In the corner, there is a freezer. 

The unpaid assistant to the Peabody's 
head preparator, Zoe halts her journey 
here. This second-tier taxidermy freezer 
looks like something you might keep in 
your basement to store last year's Otter 
Pops. It is a standard-issue chest freezer, a 
trusty Frigidaire. Dating back from before 
the company went modern and started 
writing its name in caps lock with a faddish triangle for an A, the box's logo is still 
in classic cursive. If the Frigidaire could 
pass for ten years younger, you'd swear the 
Peabody picked it up on Craigslist. 

The freezer is filled with the bodies of 
birds. Unlike the specimens filling the 
museum's sleek Ornithology freezer, the 
Frigidaire collection is not shipped cross-country by naturalists, but amassed by 
amateur donors. The packaging reflects 
this. All birds inhabit their own bag, but 
some press against the plastic, others are 
wrapped in brown paper towels. The wing 
of a barn owl in a Barnes and Nobles book 
bag pokes through the cheek of Guy de 
Maupassant. Most bags are sealed, but 
some are loosely knotted or left open; a 
Ziploc contains two mallard ducklings 
with legs so freezer-burned they look like 
rock candy. The biggest bird in the box has 
three layers of brown feathers, glossed with 
green and orange sheen. Its leg, from talon 
to knee joint, is the length of a forearm. 
This bird rests inside an unsealed black 
garbage bag, its head rubber-banded to a 
second bag that once contained a loaf of 
Pepperidge Farm sourdough. Turns out 
this specimen is a wild turkey, and in November, they're over-donated. Last year, 
the head of taxidermy painstakingly peeled 
the skin off a surplus turkey, then transferred the frozen body into a vat of marinade for his Thanksgiving dinner. 

But because the Peabody's head preparator, Michael Anderson, has been 
busy making insect models these past few 
months, the day-to-day taxidermy has 
fallen to Zoe. 

She came to the basement a year and 
a half ago looking for a hands-on way to 
join her interests in art and science, and 
was soon pushing a scalpel through neck 
flesh and driving around with a cooler in 
her trunk and a Connecticut state permit 
to pick up roadkill. Still in training, Zoe 
has yet to contribute anything to the upstairs "Birds of Connecticut" exhibit; for 
now, her handiwork is tied to cheap display boards and sent to public elementary 
schools. Her guiding text for turning these 
birds into wall-mounts is The Preparation 
of Birds for Study by James Chapin of the 
American Museum of Natural History, 
published in 1923 at the price of fifteen 
cents. It sits in photocopy on the worktable. Chapin's highly technical instructions 
are supplemented by J.H. Barry's Practical 
Taxidermy and Home Decoration, published five years later. Here is a text for 
the everyman, or maybe the gentleman, or 
any man fond of the last three items of its 
index: Water ouzels, pg.93; Woodcock on 
shed, pg.114; Yacht, traveling by, pg.32. 

At the very least, a man with patience-
when one of Zoe's colleagues ripped the 
skin on his first mount decades back, he 
threw the bird across the room. To encourage everyone to rise above these impulses, 
the preparator's studio plays exclusively 
opera. 

Every couple of weeks, Zoe selects 
a bird from the freezer. If she can, she'll 
choose one that died a summer death; 
winter birds' skeletons are sheathed in fat 
that has to be scraped off. Zoe doesn't diverge much from Chapin's 1923 instructions. She dries the blood with cornmeal 
and stuffs the head with chaff, then turns 
the whole bird inside out and fills the body 
cavity with a string and fiber model ten 
or twelve tries in the making. But a little 
modern method seeps in. Chapin suggests 
removing the brain with the handle of the 
scalpel; Zoe uses a grapefruit spoon. On 
page ten, someone has penned in, "KEEP 
FEMUR. Don't cut at knee." Chapin 
warns against warming the body too 
quickly. But the slight thawing necessary 
to strip the skin from the frozen core takes 
twenty minutes on the table. On most 
days, Zoe swaps out Michael's coffee cup 
from the office microwave, and puts a bird 
in its place. Twenty seconds does the trick. 

For years, people have just been bringing in the birds. New Haven residents call 
in with intact roadkill after having seen 
the museum's taxidermy displays, and get 
transferred to Michael Anderson. Peabody 
employees have supplied a steady stream of 
birds for as long as Michael can remember. 
The Peabody primarily reserves these birds 
for their public education programs, but 
every year, in a nod to grassroots gathering, a handful of them make it into the 
museum. Some never make it anywhere. 

The oldest label Zoe has sighted in the 
freezer, next to a small pink bird, reads 
"Wallingford, Connecticut. Killed at window. January 22, 1983". But some of the 
most unusual birds the red-shouldered 
hawk, the beautiful turkey are unlabeled. There's no telling how long they've 
sat inside the Frigidaire. 

A few months ago, a Peabody employee walked into the studio unannounced, 
threw open the lid of the freezer, and began spreading crows and hummingbirds 
and finches across the floor. After scattering several dozen bodies, he found what 
he was looking for. It was a hawk, in an 
unlabeled plastic bag. Seven years ago, he 
was speeding down the highway with his 
buddies and a trunkful of fishing tackle 
when the hawk crashed into his car, cracking the windshield. The four men turned 
around, bought an ice chest at a gas station, and headed straight home to the Peabody. They never made it to the lake. "This 
is it," he said, shaking the bag furiously, 
tearing open the seal to show a wing still 
spiked with glass. "I hoped he might get 
mounted, you know, claws around a fish." 

Maybe Zoe will resurrect this hawk 
one day. "I'm like a puppeteer," she says, 
"bringing these birds back some sort of 
life."
