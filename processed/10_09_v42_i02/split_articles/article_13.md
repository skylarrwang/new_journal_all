Nest Eggs
In backyards across New Haven, residents are hatching a fowl plan. 

FROM THE SIDEWALK, Vince Kay's house 
is indistinguishable from any other on irs 
block in New Haven's East Rock neighbor-
hood-white paint, two stories, a modest 
porch out front. Walk past the green Jeep 
and white Isuzu parked in the driveway, 
however, and you may wonder whether 
you mistakenly wound up in New Haven, 
Vermont, a town of 1700 near the west-
em border of the Green Mountain State. 
Through the window of a weathered, 
wooden barn with a plaque reading "Farm 
Bureau Member" Lies a collection of vars 
and tanks, equipment Kay uses to process 
the honey his bees produce. Nasturtiums 
creep along the edge of a vegetable garden 
that abounds with leeks, basil, peppers, 
and tomatoes srrung up on wooden trel-
Lises with strips of white cloth. Tucked in 
the back comer, a Bock of Buff Orpington 
chickens rustle and cluck in their coop, set-
cling in for another evening in New Haven. 
Kay has been keeping chickens in his 
backyard for the past twenty years, but this 
f.ill marks the first time that his birds are 
legal residents of the city. As of Septem-
October 2009 
ber 8th, an ordinance permits New Haven 
residents co keep up to six hens in their 
backyards, provided they follow a series 
of requirements for coop size, structure, 
and distance from neighboring residen-
cies. The ordinance, which passed in an 
18-8 vote by the city's Board of Aldermen, 
places New Haven among a growing num-
ber of American cities legalizing the raising 
of chickens in residential districts. In do-
ing so, these centers are redefining how we 
think about the uses of urban space, what 
it should look Like, and the tradi£ional 
boundaries between rural, suburban, and 
city Life. 


New Haven's ordinance owes irs success 
to widespread community mobilization. 
It all began two years ago with a woman 
named Rebecca Weiner, who was keeping 
a coop at her home in Westville. After 
her neighbor complained to city officials, 
Weiner was rold that, under the city's zon-
ing regulations, her birds had to go. Rather 
than give up her Bock, however, Weiner, 
gathering support from friends and pro-
ponents of urban agriculture throughout 
the city, appealed to the zoning board and 
received a special exception for her coop. 
Soon after, Alderman Roland Lamar, who 
ultimately would play a key role in the leg-
islative effort, was approached by another 
resident about Weiner's case. Lemar was 
intrigued. Though he didn't know much 
about the nuts and bolts of city chickens, 
Lemar recalls, "I liked it from a policy 
standpoint. A place like New Haven has 
limited access to good, locally produced 
proteins. [The chickens] are a great, easy, 
cheap way to produce a source of protein." 
He did a bit of research, and then spoke to 
a few colleagues on the Board of Aldermen 
about legalizing chickens. The idea was 
axed. Lemar would have let the issue lie, 
but his constituents kept pushing. At the 
time, the city's legal policy regarding chick-
ens was unclear, an unofficial don't-ask-
don't-tell. So Lemar made it his mission 
to illuminate the issue: "'Let's push it, let's 
figure it out. Lose or win, but let's figure 
it our." 


Throughout the following months, Le-
mar and two fdlow aldermen, Erin Sturgis-
Pascale and Ina Silverman, worked closely 
with local advocates as well as officials in 
zoning and public health to draft a strict 
yet sensible ordinance for urban fowl. The 
legislation was eventually voted out of 
committee and brought before the board, 
where it finally won council approval. 
Walk past the green jeep and 
white Isuzu parked in the 
drivewa~ however, and you 
may wonder whether you 
mistakenly wound up in New 
Haven:~ Vermont, a town o 
1700 near the western border 
o the Green Mountain State. 
Kay, who raises his birds for eggs, cites 
his reason for keeping the birds as largely 
gastronomic: "There's just absolutely no 
comparison. The color and the flavor are 
just so delicious." As proof, he asked me 
to hard-boil an egg and bring it to our in-
terview, so I showed up outside the coop 
holding a Tupperware container of Grade 
A Jumbo eggs from . caged chickens in 
Pennsylvania. Kay brought out his eggs, 
· laid that morning, in a small china dish 
painted with flowers. Looking at the two 
white globes I had brought, he exclaimed, 
"Look at how big they are. Oh my God, 
they're like ostrich eggs!" Then, sprinkling 
a scant half teaspoon of salt on each egg, 
we traded batches and took a bite. The first 
difference I noticed between Kay's eggs and 
my own was color. The store-bought yolk 
was a dull crayola yellow, while Kay's was 
a rich~ vivid gold. And then there was the 
texture of the homegrown eggs: buttery 
and smooth in a way that lingered almost 
decadently on the tongue. And the taste: 
a flavor that unfolded over time, growing, 
deepening, hinting at the varied diet of 
the hens, who eat natural grain mix, layer 
mash, grass clippings, and garden weeds. 
"You are what you eat," Kay told me. "If 
the birds are outside getting good light and 
good food, they produce a fantastic egg." 


Yet the city chicken movement, and the 
greater urban agricultural trend it repre-
sents, are about greater pleasures than the 
purely gustatory. As his hens ran around 
the garden, scratching in the soil in pursuit 
of worms or ·seizing fallen cherry tomatoes 
in their beaks, Kay spoke about how his 
chickens fill a prominent, and troubling, 
gap in modern urban society: "Our food 
has gotten into this really antiseptic kind 
of production at factory farms. People only 
know it through the cellophane in the gro-
cery stores." Yale English professor Cathy 
Shufro, who raises chickens at her home in 
Woodbridge, expressed a similar concern: 
"Urban children who . don't have parents 
wealthy enough to take them out to the 
country or send them to camp might well 
grow up without ever ·seeing a farm ani-
mal." The societal. model we have come to 
take for granted, with its strict dichotomy 
between urban and rural space, has created 
a mass ignorance when it comes to food 
production, best illustrated in the Rooster 
debate. Both Kay and Lemar mentioned 
repeatedly that neighbors had approached 
them and demanded to know how they ex-
pected to produce eggs without a rooster, 
which the city ordinance forbids for rea-
sons of noise control. Both had patiently 
explained that, biologically, chickens don't 
need a rooster to lay eggs, only to hatch 
chicks. Kay shakes his head. "People just 
are oblivious to how it all works." 
Kay brought out his 
eggs:~ 
laid that morning, in a small 
china dish painted with flow-
ers. Looking at the two white 
globes I had brought, he ex-
claimed "Look at how big 
they are. Oh my God they're 
like ostrich eggs!" 


The criticism that we as a society have 
forgotten, or choose to ignore, where our 
food comes from, is not a new one. But 
New Haven's chicken policies have dem-
onstrated how this criticism translates into 
a reality. While obliviousness deteriorates 
community relationships an act like mow-
ing the lawn, or planting a garden, or rais-
ing chickens creates a sense of investment 
in one's community, turning cities into de-
sirable, livable places. For the past twenty 
years, Kay has maintained good relation-
ships with his neighbors. In return, they 
have declined to repon his chicken coop 
to the Zoning Board. More broadly, he ex-
plained how raising your own food makes 
you directly responsible for the health of 
your family, and therefore more inclined 
to choose agricultural practices that pro-
mote the health of the entire community. 
"I think we'd have a healthier planet .. .if 
everyone had a garden in their backyard," 
Kay says. ''I'm sure they wouldn't spray 
their lawns and poison the wells." 
As his hens ran around the 
garden, scratching in the soil 
in pursuit o worms or seizing 
fallen cherry tomatoes in their 
beaks:~ Kay spoke about how · 
his chickens ll a prominent, 
and troubling, gap in modern 
urban-society. 


Looking back to a time when chickens 
were illegal, Lemar reflects, ·"Our zon-
ing code kind of had this antiquated vi-
sion of what cities looked like when they 
separated out defined residential zones, 
defined industrial zones, defined commer-
cial zones, and [were] not really accommo-
dating to folks who wanted to mix those 
uses." Now, residents like Kay have a legal 
right to reconsider those definitions. As 
Kay recounts the way raising vegetables 
and chickens has shaped the relationships 
that form his community, his hens begin 
rooting around the flowerbeds. He bangs 
the lid of a pot to shoo them away. He 
stays in New Haven because his relation-
ships with neighbors, store owners, and 
small businesses, in his words, "feel like 
family." A livable urban future lies in re-
lationships like these that blur boundar-
ies between commercial and communal, 
between public responsibility and private 
choice, to create integrated and invested 
communities. How do we begin to shape 
these communities? If we're anything like 
Kay, we'll do it through food.
