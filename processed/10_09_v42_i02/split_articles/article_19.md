“ONE. Two. One-two-three-four.” Just 
after 8 p.m. on September 14, an amplified 
message cracked the silence of thousands 
of mourners gathered on Cross Campus to 
commemorate Annie Le GRD '13, whose 
body had been recovered the previous af-
ternoon from the basement of 10 Amistad 
Street. Alongside the solemn addresses of 
Yale University President Richard Levin, 
University Chaplain Sharon Kugler, and 
Le's roommate, Natalie Powers, a parallel 
broadcast of "TESTING" messages, cam-
era clicks, and the shuffling of television 
crews emerged from the loudspeakers. Un-
dergraduate and graduate students, New 
Haven residents, and friends of Le—mem-
bers, as Levin put it, of a "community of 
concern"—had come to Cross Campus to 
grieve and be comforted, yet the vigil itself 
teetered on the edge of spectacle. The next 
morning, images of the sea of candle-lit 
faces would allow millions of newspaper 
readers, web-surfers, and television-watch-
ers around the world to share in the vigil. 
But there was one aspect of the experience, 
salient to all who huddled together on 
Cross Campus, that the media would not 
capture: Its own, at times intrusive, pres-
ence. 


Yet from the volume of press Le's story 
received, consumers of news could imag-
ine the media circus that New Haven 
hosted in the weeks following the Septem-
ber 8th disappearance. As city, state, and 
federal investigators tirelessly searched, 
first for Le, and then her killer, local and 
national news sources searched for a story. 
Film crews stalked press conferences, vans 
camped out on Amistad Street, and report-
ers accosted ignorant undergraduates out-
side Woodbridge Hall, Office of the Presi-
dent. Regarding the trampling of NBC 
producer Alycia Savyides by a throng of 
reporters at a New Haven Police Depart-
ment briefing, Joe Avery, a spokesperson 
for the police, told the New Haven Inde-
pendent, "I've never seen a bunch of people 
so out of control in my entire life." 

Regarding the trampling of 
NBC producer Alycia Savy-
ides by a throng of reporters 
at a New Haven Police De-
partment briefing, Joe Avery, 
a spokesperson for the po-
lice, noted "I've never seen a 
bunch of people so out of con-
trol in my entire life.”


As they had after the 1998 murder of 
Suzanne Jovin '99 and the 2003 Yale Law 
School Bombing, the press descended on 
New Haven last month for, as Editor in 
Chief of the Yale Daily News Thomas Ka-
plan put it, this "perfect storm story." A 
promising young bride-to-be missing, a 
gruesome murder with a town-gown twist: 
though not a random act, it could have 
happened anywhere, and it happened at 
Yale. Le's tragedy was simultaneously riv-
eting, bizarre, human, and relatable—and 
to the press, supremely marketable. Dur-
ing the week of September 14, the story 
drew more media coverage in America 
(seven percent) than the swine flu, the war 
in Afghanistan, or missile defense. News 
sources converted provocative images and 
words ("stuffed," "traumatic asphyxiation," 
"lab tech") into dollars: Le's murder was 
"closely followed" by about a quarter of 
the American public, according to the Pew 
Research Center for the People & Press. 

The marketability of Le's story led to 
the media's use of both new-age and age-
old tactics of sensationalist reporting. 
Along with an overload of lurid headlines 
(CBS's "Grisly Yale Murder 'Freaks' Stu-
dents" on Crime Insider) came videos 
(ABC's "Cold Feet or Foul Play?" on Good 
Morning America), online photo albums 
(CBS's "Annie Le and the Love of Her 
Life," again on Crime Insider), and inter-
active timelines (see the Hartford Courant) 
that blurred the line between informative 
and inappropriate. 

In their attempt to capture the atten-
tion of audiences in the digital age, the 
press exploited new media at the expense 
of sensitivity, and devalued their integri-
ty by engaging in the overused tactics of 
speculation and dissemination of misin-
formation. Echoing the claims made after 
Jovin's murder, rumors began circulating 
on Friday, three days after Le's disappear-
ance, that a Yale professor was the prime 
suspect in the case. The New York Post and 
New York Daily News later reported that a 
Yale student had failed a polygraph test in 
the FBI investigation. There were two pre-
mature reports of a recovered body: Sun-
day stories claimed that Le had been found 
buried in a Hartford landfill. Even when 
facts replaced these claims, the search for 
Raymond Clark III's motive in Le's murder 
bordered on amusement: Clark was angry 
at Le for her treatment of lab animals (Fox 
News); he had killed Le in a "roid rage," a 
steroid-induced frenzy (The National En-
quirer); the two had formerly been roman-
tically involved. "It's sort of frightening to 
see the misinformation that's been printed 
as fact," Kaplan remarked. 

October 2009
The Yale Daily News focused on get-
ting the facts right. Like their professional 
counterparts, the newspaper's staff spent the 
period of uncertainty following Le's disap-
pearance on the medical school campus, 
at the police station, and on the telephone 
gleaning information. Their tactics—thor-
ough investigating and conservative report-
ing—worked. Such methodology resulted 
in "CLARK CHARGED IN LE GRD '13 
MURDER" rather than the cbsnews.com 
headline from the same day, "Raymond 
Clark III and Jennifer Hromadka's Wed-
ding Web Site Goes Dark." 

THE YALE DAILY NEWS, however, had a 
few advantages, manifested not only in key-
card access to Yale buildings, but also in the 
established trust of University administra-
tors, police, and students. Moreover, Ka-
plan admits that the paper was free of its 
professional counterparts' need for "a blunt 
headline to sell newspapers." Without the 
impetus to gain readership or spur local 
interest in the Le story, there was no eco-
nomic narrative pushing dramatic excess 
onto the paper's front page. The Yale Daily 
News could afford to avoid sensationalism, 
and, as the paper serving Levin's "commu-
nity of concern," it also could not afford 
to stoop to speculation. While the murder 
might have been the national headline of 
the week, for the team at the Yale Daily 
News, said Kaplan, it was "the biggest news 
story in a decade." The students rose to the 
challenge of the occasion. "We had an op-
portunity to do really outstanding work... 
There was a very clear obligation to handle 
the story with the proper level of sensitiv-
ity." The charge not only to tell the truth, 
but tell it well, validated the intensity of 
the News' coverage. "FEMALE BODY 
FOUND AT 10 AMISTAD," while po-
tentially lurid elsewhere, felt more relevant 
at Yale, where the people, places and the 
possible threat in question hit especially 
close to home. 

"It's sort of frightening to see 
the misinformation that's been 
printed as fact," Kaplan re-
marked. 

Accuracy and sensitivity legitimized 
the already reputable paper as a source of 
news: over two million people followed the 
Annie Le, a pharmacology student at Yale School of 
Medicine, who was murdered last month. 
Le story on yaledailynews.com; Yale Daily 
News photos were sold to outside media 
sources; impressed readers posted appre-
ciative comments online, and Kaplan re-
ceived hundreds of requests for television 
interviews. 

The paper not only informed the Yale 
community, but served as its mirror, and, 
by extension, its voice. But while the staff 
received accolades for journalistic integrity, 
the paper would have gained no such at-
tention had the media not generated such 
fervor around the story in the first place. 
Interest in Raymond Clark's personal life, 
statistics on "workplace violence," and fas-
cination with Ivy League journalists went 
hand in hand with the murder. Ultimately, 
the obsession distanced Le from her own 
narrative. Though Yale vigil-goers and 
journalists alike respected life lost, the me-
dia created a story as much as it reported 
one.
