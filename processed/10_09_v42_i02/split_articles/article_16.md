'7 think you have to remember the historical moment 
when we arrive 
-~-Julia Preston, YC'73 
Journalist for The New York Times 
Julia Preston was one of roughly 500 females accepted into 
the first co-educational class at Yale of 1969. At the time, being a 
woman at Yale was just one of a handful of politically and expe-
rientially important events of the year. As Preston reminded me, 
"We were in the throes of the Vietnam war. The country was in 
tumult." Campuses nationwide were abuzz with dissent and pro-
test. The women at Yale, however, did not go unnoticed amidst 
the chaos. "I think the situation we walked into could better be 
described as chaos or upheaval ... It was clearly a university that 
did not have the experience of having women on its campus. I felt 
that every day." Women at Yale were different, it seemed, at least 
to the Yale boys, than average women. In the company of" 1,000 
male leaders," Preston explained, "We were strange creatures and 
an intimidating group. The kind of competition we went through 
to get in is. not exceptional now, but certainly was then. There 
were 500 freshman women and we were preceded by some repu-
tation that we were either outrageous nerds or intellectual ama-
zons." Though neither was really true, she remembers, "I just had 
a feeling of being unfamiliar, that we were 'The Other' coming to 
campus. 

When Preston was a freshman, the women had a curfew'--
everyone had to be in their rooms by ten. However, men would -
stay in girls' dorms well past this time in order to get "acciden-
tally" locked in overnight. The 'lock-ins' replaced bussing. Before 
women became readily .accessible in a dorm on Old Campus, 
buses from women's colleges like Barnard and Smith would park 
along Phelps Gate. Women were being imported. In retrospect, 
the situations seem rife with chauvinism, but, according to Pres-
ton, "The whole inequality thing was never part of my experience. 
I always thought of being part of that whole group of women as 
an incredibly empowering experience." 

In the spring of 1971 Preston took a !eave of absence to travel 
to South America. When she returned in 1975, a mere six years 
after gender integration, the campus had, in Preston's words, en-
tered a new era. "On the one hand, co-education had become 
quite routine, but on the other hand, in the spring of 1975 the 
war in Vietnam had ended. So I came back to a university that 
was settled." This made Preston a bit uneasy. "[It was] comforting 
to not be a strange creature _anymore but also worrisome inÂ· the 
sense that there was a sharp decline in the of the activism of the 
student body." Yale, it seemed, cooled down 
the calm wrought 
by accepted change.
