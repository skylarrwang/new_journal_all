IN FRONT OF THE lofty pillars and 
gleaming organ inside Dwight Chapel 
stand some twenty young, tuxedoed men 
arranged in a two-tiered crescent. Watch-
ing them expectantly is an audience of Yale 
undergraduates, graduate students with 
small children, and elderly men and wom-
en whispering in Russian or Ukrainian. 
A moment later the audience falls silent 
as a pure, solemn chord fills the Chapel. 
The sound, full and mysterious, is built 
of a deep, broad bass note supporting a 
middle baritone, with a bright tenor float-
ing above. This is the sound the audience 
came to hear. Even those of us who do not 
speak Russian understand that this sound 
is meant to praise the Eternal. 

It is the sound of the Yale Russian 
Chorus, a group of singers and intellectu-
als struggling to hold its ground against 
the backdrop of a changing world and a 
changing university, all the while making 
beautiful music. 

For over fifty years, the Yale Russian 
Chorus has shared the beauty of Slavic 
choral music with tens of thousands of 
Americans and Russians. The Chorus has 
helped preserve religious and folk music of 
the 17th and 18th centuries once banned 
as "dissident" by the Soviet regime. Far 
from dissolving along with the Soviet bloc 
at the end of the Cold War, the Chorus 
continues to bring the haunting liturgical 
music and humorous, spitfire folk songs of 
the Russian steppes into the present day. 
Many members speak no Russian, but 
they are still touched by the stunning, alien 
harmonies they sing. The music speaks for 
itself: in "Satrpialo," the choristers' voices 
swell and speed up to the precise clip of a 
rider spurring his horse to reach the girl 
he loves. In a slower folk song, "The Volga 
Boatmen," the sorrowful chant of peasant 
laborers builds to a powerful peak, then 
fades as the men pull the barge into the 
distance.

THE CHORUS WAS founded in 1953 al-
most by accident. One week, the Yale Rus-
sian Club, a coterie of students who met to 
discuss Russian politics and culture, invit-
ed Denis Mickiewicz, a Russian-born stu-
dent from the School of Music, to speak 
about his country's folk tunes. The charis-
matic emigre, who had fled the Soviet oc-
cupation of Latvia, didn't care to "speak" 
with the undergraduates about his musi-
cal heritage, but instead showed up with a 
guitar, mimeographed records of Russian 
folk music, and two bottles of vodka under 
his arm. The academic gathering became 
a rousing chorus of Slavophiles. Despite 
their lack of formal training in the genre, 
the men readily belted out the potent har-
monies. 

Though they started out small and 
"pretty scruffy," as one alum, Harold Hille 
(YC '66), recalls, as time went on the pas-
sionate Chorus could afford to be choosy. 
In 1959, over a hundred students tried out 
for the group. With the launch of Sputnik 
in 1957, the number of students taking 
Russian at Yale had leapt from 11 to 110. 
The Lucy-Zarubin Agreement promot-
ing US-Soviet cultural exchange had also 
just been signed, allowing the Chorus to 
embark on its first tour of the USSR in 
1958. The Yale Russian Choristers had be-
gun their career as musical diplomats sans 
portfolio. 

During their first tour of the USSR, 
the 18 Yale men gathered each day in a 
public square and began to sing African-
American spirituals for roughly twenty 
minutes in an effort to establish themselves 
as a definitively American singing group. 
They then switched to Russian songs. 
Immediately, eager Russians would inter-
rupt them, curious about these American 
kids who sang ancient Russian folk and 
sacred music. Despite the danger of con-
versing with foreigners, the Soviet citizens 
could not contain their wonder. A corner 
of the Iron Curtain had been raised, and 
both sides peered through curiously and 
critically. Soviets demanded to know how
