**Can This Accountant-Cum-Psychic Take Stock of Your Future?**
**Author: Haley Cohen**
**Page number(s): 21**

You DONT HAVE to be a psychic to grasp 
that accounting can be boring. Not just 
makes-you-wanna-tap-your-foot-' cause-
there's-nothing-better-to-do boring, but 
would-rather-watch-a-snail-crawl-a-mar-
athon, potential-cure-for-insomnia, start-
hearing-voices-that-nobody-else-can bor-
â€¢ mg. 

Denise Petry, who worked as an ac-
countant for 20 years, often hears those 
voices, but not in the way that will get 
you locked up. In fact, she started hearing 
them long before the number crunching 
and checkbook managing had a chance to 
erode her sanity. They don't tell her spe-
cific things like, "Joe, the guy at the Deli 
counter is a molester!" They merely sug-
gest, "Hmmm, something's off with Joe." 
"I used to think I was just a really good 
guesser," she laughs. But then, here and 
there, she would "guess" that a friend was 
pregnant or that a family: member would 
get a divorce and "what do you know? It 
would happen!" 

Now SHE "GuESSEs" for a living. As a 
professional psychic reader, Petry makes 
a career out of flipping tarot cards. She 
hands me the deck and asks that I "put my 
energy into the cards." I don't really know 
what this means so I stare willfully at the 
cards as I mix them, hoping that will be 
good enough. 

I hand them back to Petry, who splays 
the deck into a fan shape on the table, sets 
a timer for twenty minutes, (the length of 
a reading $25 buys), and invites me to pick 
a card. 

Flip. 

The card depicts two young children, 
both blonde and cherubic, standing in 
front of a thatched-roof cottage behind 
which the sun is beginning to set. The 
boy, clad in a tunic with a periwinkle belt, 
extends a cup full of flowers to his female 
friend who looks back at him, eyes glassy 
with adoration. 

"A.b., the six of cups. This means that an 
old love will return to you," Petry declares. 
Hmm, I think. Old loves? Old loves? 
Do I have ANY old loves? Maybe she 
means John Smith from Pocahontas? My 
crush on him as a 5-year old was intense 
enough to qualify as love. Granted, he was 
also animated. 


As Petry reads my cards, l watch her. 
She is not the kind of person I would 
have expected to give me my first psychic 
reading. She doesn't wear black robes, talk 
about chakras or reek of incense. Her urn-
ber hair is coiffed into a professional bob 
with bangs, and her face is neatly made 
up. When she speaks it is with certainty, 
and not as though she is channeling words 
through some invisible third party. "The 
best psychics are the normal folks," she ex-
plains. "The one's who go around scream-
ing 'I'm mystical!' 
those are the ones 
you gotta watch out for because they're 
almost always full of crap." 


A brawny man in a tartan kilt stares up 
from the card's glossy surface. He clutch-
es a long staff and stares down at the six 
wands pointed at him, challenging them 
to explode with his belligerent glare. 

"The seven of wands. This means there's 
a lot of competition in the field you will 
pursue but you will tough it out. It also 
means you'll probably do something cre-
ative -
writing, TV, something artistic. 
Any other questions?" 

'She's right!' I think excitedly. 1\.fter all, 
I do want to go into journalism of some
