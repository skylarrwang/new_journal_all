Americans espousing the ideal of liberty 
could allow racial segregation to persist in 
their country. On one occasion, a Chorus 
~ember crumpled up his draft card and 
driver's license and left them in the pub-
lic square to prove that US citizens could 
move freely without papers. 

A er a concert in Cali ornia 
in the late 60s, Carter says 
a bearish Russian man with 
tears streaming down his -ace 
told the Chorus that Mother 
Russia "lives 
hearts." 

The Chorus ·returned to the Soviet 
Union the following two years, but Mick-
iewicz, after receiving hints that the Soviet 
government might not respect his recent-
ly-acquired American citizenship and ar-
rest him for alleged "war crimes," chose 
not to tour in 1960. Soviet citizens did 
not go unscathed by the group's presence 
either. The Chorus would return to find 
that organizations whose members they 
had met in past years had been dissolved; 
former contacts had simply vanished. The 
Chorus knew their movements were being 
tracked and later learned that the secret 
police regularly questioned everyone seen 
speaking to them. "The Soviets were get-
ting more and more determined to block 
real cultural exchange," recalls Hille. "They 
wanted to manage it, and we were like 
gypsies," itinerant and irritating to the offi-
cials. Hille laughs a bit grimly, remarking, 
"we were there as tourists, kids, and we 
didn't really know about consequences." 

Though naive about Cold War reality 
in the Soviet Union, these self-appointed 
ambassadors took their work seriously. 
According to Hille, "We were really loyal 
US guys and were trying to do our bit for 
democracy, for the freedom of thought 
that we read about in school." The United 
States government declared itself thrilled 
with the Yalies' efforts. Then-Senator Hu-
bert Humphrey wrote in 1960: "The Yale 
Russian Chorus has done a most effeCtive 
job in communicating the American mes-
sage to the Soviet people ... the only trag-
edy is that we don't have ten or fifty or a 
hundred choruses such as yours." The State 
Department may have had more than just 
a passing interest in the effectiveness of 
promising, young Russian-speaking men. 
As late as the 1980s, after a concen at the 
October 2009 
White House, the Chorus was asked to re-
port on their observations of Gorbachev 
to the government. 

The Chorus had a cultural mission in 
the United States as well. On their return 
from the Soviet Union in 1958, the New 
York Times featured their picture on its 
front page and the "Today Show" invited 
them to discuss their experience in the 
USSR During Spring Break the Chorus 
would drive to California and back, sing-
ing concerts daily at colleges and the oc-
casional Russian Orthodox church along 
the route. They opened their shows with 
lectures on their observations of Soviet so-
ciety. The Chorus, Hille contends, wanted 
to bring "Russian and Eastern European 
issues to Americans and keep the issues 
alive, to try to put a human face on their 
gl , 
strug e. 

Hille, who still organizes the two-hun-
dred-person reunions of Chorus alumni, 
and who speaks a dozen languages, took 
that humanizing mission to heart, first 
working as a translator for the United Na-
tion, and then as a professor of Russian 
at Yale. Brian Carter (PhD '92), another 
alum who continued to sing with the Cho-
rus while working at Yale, has a slightly 
different 
but no less impassioned view 
of the Chorus' political role. "In 1968, we 
were singing revolutionary songs, and we 
meant it, we were really dissatisfied," he 
says. "It was the Vietnam War years and 
May Day." 

During this era of activism, the Cho-
rus successfully mixed politics with seri-
ous music. In 1962, they won first place 
at an international choral festival in Litle, 
France. During the same tour, in Berlin, 
they sang at the spot along the Berlin Wall 
where Peter Fechter had been shot trying 
to flee to the West. Then, in 1963, Soviet 
agents detained Yale professor Frederick 
Barghoorn on charges of espionage. When 
both the university and the State Depart-
ment refused to confront the USSR over 
the matter, the Russian Chorus decided 
to get involved. "We started raising hell," 
Hille laughs. They organized a letter-writ-
ing campaign and managed to convince 
the American Organization of Professors 
to protest to the State Department. After 
14 days of confinement, Barghoorn was 
released. 

But 1963 saw losses for the Chorus as 
well. That year, Mickiewicz left Yale to be-
gin his career as a comparative literature 
professor. With no native Russians left to 
ensure authenticity of singing or interpre-
tation, the Chorus clung to the traditions 
its founder had left behind. However, 
despite frequent shifts in leadership, 
it remained much the same organism 
throughout the Cold War, driven by the 
emotional interpretations and cultural 
agenda instituted by the former director. 

WITH THE COLLAPSE of the Soviet 
Union in 1991, Russia ceased to compel 
as much student interest as it had before. 
Furthermore, the end of the Cold War 
brought with it a flowering of traditional 
choruses in Russia, thus rendering the 
Chorus' role as cultural preservation-
ist obsolete. As the group's political rel-
evance waned, so, in turn, did several of 
its traditions. In 1995, students of the 
Russian Chorus stopped relying on stu-
dent conductors, a custom instated fol-
lowing the departure of Mickiewicz, by 
inviting early music expert Mark Bailey 
(YSM '89) to serve as permanent artistic 
director. Bailey had recently graduated 
from the Institute of Sacred Music at 
Yale and was teaching music at St. Vladi-
mir's Orthodox Seminary in New York. 

Dissatisfied with the trend of interpret-
ing Russian choral music with the rough 
gusto of peasants, Bailey was determined 
to bring a more European refinement to 
the group. Raised in Ukraine, Bailey had 
grown up surrounded by music, and, as 
a child, sang in his grandmother's choir 
at the local Ukrainian Orthodox church. 

Bailey's connection to Slavic culture is 
as deep as the repertoire itsel£ ''I'm con-
ducting Russian marching songs and 
my great grandfather was in the Czar's 
Army," he says with a smile. In an era 
when interest in Russian culture at Yale is 
too casual to make student conductors a 
feasible option, the members of the cur-
rent Chorus are grateful for a consistent 
musical mentor. 

Bailey takes a different approach 
to the music than that of his predeces-
sors. Carter observes that Bailey "drills 
his choir as though they were singing 
Brahms: they are very professional, in a 
fine West European concert choir mode." 
Their clear, open harmonies, however, 
come at the price of the old boisterous 
masculinity of Mickiewicz's days. Bailey 
also began to change the Chorus' reper-
toire, ending the decades-old tradition of 
allowing alumni to sing in any rehearsal 
or performance. Alumni who graduated 
before 1995 felt as though someone had 
changed the lock on the door to their 
own home. Caner, who had sung regu-
larly with the Chorus for nearly three de-
cades, does not want to "steal" the Cho-
rus from the current students. "On the

other hand," he says, opening his palms, "I 
miss it! I miss being able to drop into a re-
hearsal and sing songs I know." Like many 
Russian Choristers of the past and pres-
ent, Carter and Hille, men with no for-
mal musical training, valued their chance 
to sing in a serious and vibrant ensemble. 
Thanks to the Yale Russian Chorus, Carter 
says with wonder, he, as a "rank amateur," 
has sung five times in Carnegie Hall. "It's 
a high," Carter says. "You lose yourself as 
part of this organism making these beauti-
ful sounds." 

The pre-1995 alums still meet annu-
ally, and remain as raw and shirt-ripping 
as ever under the baton of Maestro Mick-
iewicz, who continues to conduct them. 
The Alumni of the Yale Russian Chorus 
(a5 they designat,ed themselves after a legal 
tug-of-war with the group on campus) still 
· perform reunion concerts at Carnegie Hall 
and other prestigious stages. Membership 
is at least four hundred-strong worldwide, 
and at least two hundred former Cho-
risters show up to , each rem1ion. Among 
them are former high ranking State De-
partment officials, ambassadors, and a for-
mer US Solicitor General who now teaches 
at Yale Law School. An offshoot group of 
alumni continue to perform professionally 
as the chorus Slovyanka in San Francisco. 
This winter, past choristers will fly to New 
Haven from around the world to celebrate 
Mickiewicz's 80th birthday with three 
days of rehearsals, recording sessions and 
performances. Shortly thereafter, Mickie-
wicz will fly to Moscow to deliver a lecture 
on "Khoristoria," the documentary history 
of the Yale Russian Chorus. 

Despite an active alumni life, many 
older alumni remain unsettled by the new 
Chorus' heightened musicality and de-
politicization. For Hille, the former UN 
translator, the Chorus was a way to fulfill 
Yale's mission for its "students and gradu-
ates to becortle active in the world, to play 
a role, be involved in decision making, get 
involved in some of the fights that were 
going on out there." In 2005, Hille asked 
the Chorus to help raise campus awareness · 
about the Orange Revolution in Kiev, and, 
more recently, about the war in Georgia. 
Speaking like a concerned parent, Hille re-
marks that the older alumni "are puzzled 
by the current group, how different they 
are musically, and what they see as the rea-
son for doing this." In the past, he says, 
that reason was tied to a "sense of what 
being a concerned and engaged individual 
meant, and I would love to see that resur-
rected." Acknowledging the changed po-
litical scene, he adds, "I think nowadays, 
20 
in order to have an equivalent experience, 
you'd have to have an Iranian chorus ora 
North Korean chorus ... some group that's 
demonized in the American press." 

Current chorus members sympathize 
with these indictments. They lament the 
slackened energy, the lack ofpolitical con-
scientiousness, and the loss of songs like 
the foot-stomping "Kalinka," (a favorite 
on Soviet tours). At the same time, the 
students echo Hille's observation that the 
world is a different place . . "Russia and 
Eastern Europe are no longer 'the Second 
World'," says Ian Randolph (YC'10): Rus-
sian issues don't claim c·ampus attention, 
and the Chorus is no longer a political or-
. 
. '

This art they defend vigorously. Nicho-
las Villalon (MED'10) stresses that Bailey 
preserves expressive spontaneity by urg-
ing the singers to understand the songs 
through music and text. Randolph, with 
no previous musiCal training, is grateful to 
Bailey for transforming him into a semi-
professional singer. He loves the music, 
and speaks with relish of how the sing-
ers "bite into the weird dissonances, the 
weird-sounding chords." For current Cho-
rus President Adam Haliburton (YC'10), 
the Chorus satisfied his wish to be part of 
"something a little more elevated, classical, 
liturgical." 

· Yet the question remains: without the 
Cold War, why is there still a Yale Rus-
sian Chorus? Some, like Hille, believe the 
group is not long for this world, and are 
resigneP. to let it die peacefully. But the 
current Chorus members are not so mor-
bid. As long as the group has a permanent 
director, and is not too tied to a shifting 
student population, it seems that the Cho-
rus, a Yale tradition, is likely to survive. 

While the Chorus sometimes struggles 
for its footing here at Yale, the group con-
tinues to perform semi-professionally to 
great acclaim around the US. Their 1996 
commercial album was placed on the New 
York Times "Critic's Choice List," and the 
singers hope to record another such album 
this year or next. Their political presence 
has shrunk, but the music remains power-
ful. Randolph believes the Chorus is "more 
than just a curiosity ... I think there is are-
ally deep soul to our music." The Chorus 
has also adapted. Rather than singing to 
American students, it often books Ortho-
dox churches and sings for Russian expa-
triates who have little opportunity to hear 
their native music. After a concert in Cali-
fornia in the late 60s, Carter says a bearish 
Russian man with tears streaming down 
his face told the Chorus that Mother Rus-
• 
sia "lives again in your hearts." Even now, 
it is not unusual for the current group to 
provoke tears and equally profuse gratitude 
on the part of their Slavic audiences. The 
Chorus also continues to tour. Haliburton 
has arranged concerts in Connecticut and 
New York, at Harvard, and even a perfor-
mance with the celebrated Slavic choir 
Capella Romana. Moreover, the President 
has tried to increase recruitment by sharp-
ening the Chorus' image with magnificent 
banners and public exposure. Villalon 
suggests the Chorus might retain singers 
better if its repertoire changed more often, 
while Randolph hopes the Chorus can 
become a "larger musical personality'' by 
holding more free campus performances. 

Ultimately, however, the Chorus suffers 
from two chronic troubles endemic to Yale 
groups 
low membership and limited 
leadership, both conditions that tend to 
exacerbate each other. Every graduation 
rocks the boat, especially when the Presi-
dent, the _primary organizational figure, 
prepares to leave. 

Yet the music itself has staying power, 
and each year, new students join. The an-
swer to the Chorus' survival lies deeper, all 
the way back to the Yale Russian Club's 
transformation into the Yale Russian Cho-
rus in 1953. Why were these men not 
content just to talk about Russian music 
and culture? The founder has an idea of 
the reason. "Much of the mythology of 
the songs is universal," explains Mickie-
wicz in his thick accent. "The woes and 
joys of love are universal ... hard fighting 
is, alas, also universal." These themes are 
not generational, nor is the joy of singing 
determined by political bent. In truth, the 
interaction between the Chorus' singers 
and its music has changed very little since 
1953. Carter joined the Chorus in 1969 
after hearing the Red Army Chorus play-
ing in a dorm room he happened to pass. 
Villalon remembers randomly picking up 
a CD of Russian vespers in high school. 
He heard a "shockingly eerie and haunt-
ing" sound he could not forget. Randolph 
is also inspired by the sound. When Bai-
ley tunes the Chorus carefully, Randolph 
says, "We get these really nice sonorities 
where the overtones come out. The chords 
almost make me believe in God."
