called liberal socialist. The main 
spokesman of this group is the nat-
ural scientist and winner of the Lenin 
and Stalin Prize, Andrei Sakharov. 
This reform movement is aspiring to 
a democratization, the abolition of 
censorship, the curbing of the secret 
police, the introduction of the rule of 
law in the Soviet Union, economic 
reform, and amnesty for all political 
prisoners. Some of them believe that 
these reforms might come about 
even in the one-party system, but 
with a tremendous change in the 
Party itself. The majority of the 
liberal-socialists would prefer a 
multi-party system on socialist 
foundations. They are combining 
their struggle for democratization 
and liberalization with a sympathy 
for social democratic movements.and 
liberals in Western Europe and the 
United States. Many of them are 
natural scientists; some are econo-
mists and they state that the Soviet 
Union cannot successfully achieve 
the scientific and technological rev-
olution of our time if it doesn't 
change the system accordingly. 
The second tendency is ethical or 
religious in nature, and is sometimes 
labeled ethical socialist. Their aims 
are exactly the same as those of the 
liberal-socialists. But they strongly 
maintain that no economic and poli-
tical reforms have any value or can 
really be pursued without an ethical 
and moral regeneration of Soviet 
society. Some stress Christianity, 
some a non-denominational religious 
basis, and some purely ethical 
grounds. The main spokesman is 
Lev Venkov, who wrote Thought, 
the pragmatic manifesto of this 
ethical group. The theologian 
Krasnov Levitin is the most out-
spoken of the group. He has written 
many remarkable books, none of 
which were published in the Soviet 
Union, but which were spread clan-
destinely. It is likely that Solzhen-
itsyn is very friendly to this trend 
of the dissident movement. 
There is a third trend which is 
oppositional Marxist-Leninist. They 
adhere to the October Revolution 
and to the Leninist period of the 
Soviet Union, seeing the whole 
departure from the original ideas as 
having come after Lenin's death. 
Like the first two groups, they favor 
the democratization of society, the 
abolition of censorship, and the 
reduction of the power of the 
secret police. But it is not for the 
sake of democracy alone, but for the 
concept of a socialist democracy; 
they stress this distinction very 
much indeed. They also believe that 
a renaissance of Marxism might 
transform the Communist Party. 
The most outspoken leader of this 
group is Roy Medvedyev, who wrote 
On Socialist Democracy.

This book is as important for the 
third trend as Levitin and Solzhen-
itsyn are for the second one, and 
Sakharov's manifesto, Progress, 
Coexistence, and Intellectual 
Freedom, is for the first. 
These would be the three main ten-
dencies in the Soviet dissident move-
ment, but they work together, of 
course, because they have a common 
enemy and common aims. 
When I spoke now about the three 
tendencies, I meant their philosoph-
ical background, and their differ-
ences in politics and philosophy. 
At the same time we have those who 
favor an evolutionary transfor-
mation, and those who believe that 
only a direct revolutionary struggle 
can cause this transformation. 
Medvedyev, a Marxist-Leninist, has 
great hope that the government can 
be evolutionarily transformed with 
the help of the more enlightened 
reformist groups in the Party. On the 
other hand there is General Grig-
orenko, a member of the Communist 
Party for almost 30 years, promoted 
to the rank of general during World 
War II, and later a professor of mili-
tary cybernetics in the Frunzer 
Military Academy (the highest mili-
tary academy in the Soviet Union). 
He broke away and became not just 
a dissident but the leading revolu-
tionary figure of the dissident move-
ment. He is an old and sick man now, 
for he has been in a psychiatric clinic 
for many years. 
It would be difficult to say if Solz-
henitsyn is evolutionary or revolu-
tionary, because he has never made 
his personal viewpoint on the issue 
very clear. But there is no question 
that his books, in particular Gulag 
Archipelago, are much stronger in 
their criticism than the other two 
most famous books of the Soviet dis-
sident movement, Medvedyev's 
On Socialist Democracy and 
Sakharov's Progress, Coexistence, 
and Intellectual Freedom. 
Based on the work of my good 
friend Boris Levitsky, who has 
studied about 800 political prisoners, 
we can say that those who openly 
signed petitions with their names 
and addresses are primarily intellec-
tuals; many of them are natural 
scientists, writers and poets, 
engineers, a few educated military 
officers, economists, and lawyers. 
But if we look at those who are tried 
at the political trials for belonging 
to the dissident movement and/or 
spreading their materials, we get a 
very different picture-only slightly 
more than half are intellectuals. The 
other half are common, ordinary 
people. Many are intelligent and 
educated blue-collar workers, among 
them truck drivers. There are very 
few civil servants and very few 
collective farmers, which implies 
that it's primarily an urban move-
ment and still led and carried by the 
intellectuals. 
We have to differentiate between 
the dissident movement in Russia 
proper and the movement in the 
non-Russian parts of the Soviet 
Union. In Russia proper, it's still 
heavily dominated by the intellec-
tuals. In the non-Russian parts of 
the Soviet Union, it is much more a 
mass movement; in the Baltic 
countries, the Ukraine, the 
Caucasus, and Soviet Central Asia, 
the struggle for the democratization 
of the regime is combined with a 
struggle against Russification, and .#J 
for national autonomy. For instance, 
the most vocal members of the whole 
dissident movement are the Crimean 
Tartars, who were deported from the 
Crimea in 1944 and are still not 
permitted to return to their home-
lands. Petitions of Crimean Tartars 
have been signed by more than 
60,000 people. 
There are two ways of spreading 
your opinions in the Soviet Union. 
One is the method of Samisdat, 
which is sometimes called the 
"five" method. This means that you 
type five copies of your Samisdat 
material; it can be a non-political 
reform program, poetry, a novel, 
or an historical, philosophical, or 
theological essay. You give it to your 
trusted friends, who in turn type five 
copies and return the original. Quite 
a lot of material is spread all over 
the Soviet Union with this snowball 
system. It has been estimated that ' J 
from 140,000 to 180,000 Samisdat 
copies of Solzhenitsyn's works exist. 
The practice is so widespread that 
there are people who literally do not 
read anything which is convention-
ally printed-they only read Samis-
dat materials. There are even jokes 
about the Samisdat: one Soviet 
citizen of about 45 goes to another 
one and finds that he is typing a 
textbook for ninth-grade physics. 
So he says, "What are you doing? 
Why should you retype a textbook 
that you can buy in every store?" 
The other replies,"Well, what can I 
do? My son doesn't read anything 
printed anymore." 
The second and more important 
way of transmitting information is 
through the Russian language broad-
casts of Western radio stations, par-
ticularly Radio Liberty, the Russian '.J 
broadcast from BBC London, the 
German Wave, Radio Israel, and to 
a certain degree the Russian broad-
cast from The Voice of America. 
Through these Russian-language 
broadcasts, the Soviet population 
gets to know the contents of the 
Samisdat materials because, to a 
high degree, Russian language 
broadcasts from the West transmit 
more Samisdat than their own com-

mentaries. This is one of the reasons 
why the Soviet leadership is pressing 
so hard to stop the broadcasts. 
To estimate the strength of the 
dissident movement would be very 
difficult. I would think that there are 
somewhere around 5,000-10,000 
active members of the movement 
writing these materials and distri-
buting them. This may sound like 
very few in a country of 240 million. 
It might sound like very much if we 
remember that around 1909, eight 
years before the October Revolution, 
there were not many more than 
15,000-10,000 activists struggling 
against the Czarist regime. 
Erlich and Barghoom explain, in 
more detail, the case of Solzhenitsyn: 
Erlich: A major reason for the So-
viets waging such a vicious cam-
paign against Solzhenitsyn is be-
cause of the nature of his latest mes-
sage, contained in The Gulag Archi-
pelago. He takes the story all the 
way back to the first years of the 
Revolution. 
Solzhenitsyn is not content 
with blaming Stalin for what hap-
pened in Russia. He also places a 
great deal of blame on Lenin, and 
this is absolutely unthinkable as far 
as the Soviet regime is concerned. 
This is a regime whose legitimacy, 
such as it is, is largely an ideological 
one. They are unhappy about the vio-
lent attacks on Stalin, but challenges 
to Stalin can be localized-the Stalin 
cult collapsed in the Soviet Union 
some time ago. But the Lenin cult 
has replaced it, and to challenge or 
criticize Lenin is rank heresy. 
One Day in the Life of Ivan Den-
isovitch was a bombshell, because 
Solzhenitsyn broke a taboo. Millions 
of Russians knew about the exis-
tence of the Soviet forced-labor camp 
system-many of them knew it 
through their own experience. But 
this was a "non-subject," an "un-in-
stitution," as it were. As a fellow dis-
sident put it, the crucial thing about 
Solzhenitsyn's debut was that he 
had the courage to say what many 
people knew to be true, but did not 
dare articulate. 
Solzhenitsyn established himself 
as a spokesman, not for any particu-
lar ideology, nor any specific chal-
lenge to the regime, but for the mil-
lions of silent Russians who have 
gone through the ordeal that he por-
trays so vividly. 
Barghoom believes that Solzhen-
itsyn's roots are in the pre-Commu-
nist Russian culture, a culture that 
was suppressed by the regime, but 
never completely destroyed. Barg-
hoom also calls Solzhenitsyn's mo-
tivation a very patriotic one that 
could be held by almost any Commu-
nist. Solzhenitsyn got in trouble ar-
ticulating his criticism of Stalin in 
letters to his schoolmate, for which 
he was arrested. 
Barghoom adds that the Soviet 
press has accused Solzhenitsyn of 
being bourgeois. Yet Barghoom 
points out that although he came 
from a bourgeois family, his father 
died young, leaving his mother, a 
schoolteacher, to support the family. 
He grew up in poverty. 
Erlich explains the roots of Sol-
zhenitsyn's non-ideological approach: 
The dissident movement has drawn 
upon the great tradition of literary 
non-conformism and literary dissent 
which is part and parcel of 19th cen-
tury Russian literature. This tra-
dition was driven underground by 
Stalin in the thirties, forties and 
early fifties. When the air became 
just a bit more breathable after 
Stalin's death, due to Khrushchev's 
half-hearted but still audible call 
for some plain speaking; it was main-
ly the writer who came to the fore to 
offer some bits of a submerged story. 
At this time, writers were heard to 
say, "We have been squelched as in-
dividuals. We have been pushed 
around, and we think the time has 
come for the individual to speak out." 
Barghoom states that Solzhen-
itsyn takes a "militant moralistic 
position." It is this moral outlook 
and his insistence on telling the truth 
which finally got him expelled from 
the Soviet Writer's League in 1969, 
in part because of the content of One 
Day. 
Erlich: Solzhenitsyn is a major 
writer. His importance is inseparable 
from, and to a large extent ascribable 
to, his moral force and the scope and 
indispensability of his message. I 
consider him a writer of remarkable 
gifts. Though he has a very fine com-
mand of language, he is not one 
of the greatest contemporary styl-
ists. But he is a remarkable story-
teller. The First Circle, apart from 
being an invaluable account of the 
Stalinist system, is a narrative tour 
de force. August 1914 is not quite 
so well constructed. At his best, 
Solzhenitsyn is a remarkably re-
sourceful novelist. Even more 
striking than his ability to tell a 
compelling story is his ability to 
encompass a variety of vividly real-
ized characters within a very confin-
ing milieu-be it a KGB institute or 
the cancer ward of a hospital. 
Solzhenitsyn has a sense of charac-
ter that is very rare these days, 
which in fact may now be called old-
fashioned. Many of Solzhenitsyn's 
virtues are old-fashioned. He is not a 
modern writer par excellence. He 
is a realist if I ever saw one, operating 
powerfully within a 19th century 
realistic tradition. But I'll still take 
a first-rate realist rather than a 
second-rate modernist any time. 
Barghoom, like Erlich, places 
Solzhenitsyn in the classical Russian 
literary tradition. He adds, however, 
that this tradition now clashes with 
Socialist Realism. "Solzhenitsyn was 
in a straightjacket in this system." 
"Solzhenitsyn is a very special 
case," Barghoom summarizes, "be-
cause he lies somewhat outside the 
mainstream of the dissident move-
ment. He regards himself as a moral 
critic." As a moralist, he differs 
much from other Soviet dissidents in 
that he espouses no ideological ideas. 
Barghoom thinks Solzhenitsyn has 
more of an affinity to the Slavophiles 
of the 19th century. "He emphasizes 
Russian historical values. He is a 
Russian patriot." 
Each professor had something 
to say about the future-both of 
Solzhenitsyn and of the dissident 
movement: 
Erlich: Solzhenitsyn's future as a 
public force is obviously precarious. 
The Soviets are doing their best to 
drive a wedge between Solzhenitsyn 
and his natural constituency, and for 
all I know, they may be making 
some headway. On the one hand they 
would like the Russians to forget 
about his existence. On the other 
hand, as long as they print 16-col-
umn articles about him, as they just 
did in the organ of the Soviet Writ-
er's Union, they are not exactly con-
tributing to this goal. Their hope is 
that he will be a 90-day wonder in the 
West, and that in three months he 
will be forgotten. Now that Solzhen-
itsyn is absent from Russia, they 
are hoping that he will sink into the 
woodwork. This is not so easily 
achieved, since he is not a man who 
Victor Erlich (left), born in Petrograd (now 
Leningrad) in 1914, lived in Warsaw from 
1918 to 1939. He taught for 14 years at the 
University of Washington before joining the 
Yale faculty in 1963. He has published books 
on Gogol, Russian formalism and modern 
Russian poetry. 
Soviet-educated Wolfgang Leonhard (right) 
worked as a propagandist, teacher and jour-
nalist in the U.S.S.R. and E. Germany before 
defecting to Yugoslavia in 1949. He came to 
Yale in 1966, and has written three books; his 
last, Three Faces of Marxism, was recently 
published by Holt/Rinehart/Winston. 
Frederick Barghoorn has written extensively 
about the dissidents; he edited Chornovil's 
letters. In 1963 he was held "hostage" in a 
Moscow prison for 12 days until President 
Kennedy secured his release. 
can be easily silenced. But it is en-
tirely possible that after he finally 
buys a house in Switzerland some of 
the Western press may lose interest 
in him. A great deal will depend on 
what he does next. 
Speaking of the dissident move-
ment in general, Barghoom says: 
The future of the dissidents in the 
U.S.S.R. will depend on the total 
pattern of international affairs in the 
next few years. It will depend on the 
West remaining viable and vigorous 
with something to say to the East. 
World peace must be maintained, 
and the Sino-Soviet relations will al-
so figure. All of these variables make 
prediction extremely difficult. 
Barghoom believes that there is 
only a "small hope" for liberalization 
in the U.S.S.R. in the coming decade. 
He remarks that in the last 4 or 
5 months a debate has been going on 
between people like Sakharov and 
Solzhenitsyn on the one hand, and 
people like Medvedyev on the other, 
about the current foreign policy line 
in the U.S.S.R. Sakharov and 
Solzhenitsyn argue that detente 
endangered dissenters and worked 
against liberalization. Medvedyev 
says that in the long run, increased 
contacts with the West will help 
liberalization. 
Barghoom: There is a need to 
press for the principle of individual 
freedom and legality and to hold the 
U.S.S.R. to the terms of the U.N. 
doctrine. When change comes, it will 
probably come partly from the politi-
cal system through reform leaders 
like Khrushchev and pressure from 
certain elements in the population, 
like scientists and intellectuals, and 
possibly from pressure from liberal 
foreign communist countries like 
Italy. 
Leonhard: In the last two or three 
years the Soviet regime has cracked 
down so hard that the power and in-
fluence of the dissident movement 
has been considerably weakened. 
But I think they still have a great 
role in the future and I can foresee 
clearly that we will have monuments 
in big Soviet cities of Solzhenitsyn, 
Sakharov, Amalrik, Bukovsky, and 
Grigorenko. 0
