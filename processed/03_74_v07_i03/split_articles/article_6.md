The networks say that controversy on commercial television is dangerous. It can offend potential sponsors. It can provoke both legal battles and, under current FCC guidelines, demands for rebuttal time. As a result, controversy is rarely sought and never bought from outside sources. One of the more controversial recent documentaries was "A Question of Torture," an expose of the tiger-cage torturing of political prisoners in Saigon jails. Though produced by a prize-winning crew for Granada Television in England, the film was turned down by all major American networks. 

Leonard explained that CBS refuses to buy these independently produced documentaries for the same reason it taboos in-house personal documentaries-CBS must be responsible for the film's objectivity. He admitted, though, that he has no way of knowing if every foot of film is, in fact, "objective"-even when CBS produces the film. He must trust his filmmakers to be fair. 

The networks do have the power, though, to make any film seem objective. They wrap all the subjectivity into a slick news documentary that bears the stamp of the network. The film speaks with the same deceptive authority as does the man behind the curtain in The Wizard of Oz. 

The stamp of objectivity in network documentaries cuts the documentary genre off from its openly subjective roots. Robert Flaherty, one of the first American documentary filmmakers, believed that the most honest cinematic portrayal required manipulation of his subject matter. He built his films around consciously imposed romantic themes like man's struggle for survival in the cold north or on a tropical island. To document what he felt to be the truth about the Eskimo lifestyle in "Nanook of the North," he employed fictional techniques like scripting and staging. 

Flaherty used forms of distortion to translate a personal, subjective experience into cinematic reality. 

But subjective realities are not in the stock of network truths. "The rationale behind personal films, like Flaherty's in the thirties," said Al Wasserman, "is a rationale the networks have never accepted. Sure, every network filmmaker would like to do personal documentaries, but they're extremely difficult to get money for. The networks go for the big-money, big-issue films that make the definitive statement." 

To date, the only nationwide television market for personal documentaries has been PBS, the non-commercial network. Because it makes no claims to any "definitive statement," PBS can air clearly biased documentaries -like the Black militant film, "Black Journal." Since it recognizes the subjectivity of film, it has become the only forum for documentaries like Frederick Wiseman's. 

Wiseman, a Harvard Law School graduate, gave up his Cambridge law practice after he bought his first movie camera. He has been making documentaries ever since, and hiring other lawyers to defend them. 

Wiseman's films explore the power structures behind such American institutions as a hospital, a police station, a boot camp, a juvenile court and an asylum for the criminally insane. He uses no music and no narration. "Narrative in documentaries always sounds condescending to me," says Wiseman, "as if someone is trying to tell me what to think. 

"I work under the assumption," he says, "that if you just watch people in meaningful interactions you can see truths more illuminating than any narrative can give you." 

The truth he attempts to convey in his films is not in the form of a rational argument. It is something more complex and subtle, depicting the quality of his personal experience in making the film. He does no research before beginning his work. Themes begin to unfold only as he shoots and reacts to the scene. 

When his reactions are settled, Wiseman retreats to his editing room to recreate his experience. 

"Editing is a purely subjective process," he believes. "This thing of objectivity is a lot of crap, as anyone with average intelligence and twenty seconds to think about it knows. The issue is fairness. I use subjective techniques to make a personal documentary statement that is fair to my subjective experience in making the film.'' 

But because Wiseman's statement is visual instead of verbal, it is rich in a way that reportage films can never be. "I have a mind that resists any kind of absolute clarity," he says. As a result, he offers no argument that can be accepted or rejected apart from the film. His statement is the film itself. You can watch it more than once, and each time learn more of Wiseman's vision, and find fresh images to build your own. 

Wiseman's films will not be found on commercial television. He has made several unsuccessful attempts to convince commercial networks to air his films, and the failure makes him cynical. 

"It's a total waste of time to argue with the networks," he says. "They always want to cut and censor-and if my film is going to be changed like that, then it's no longer my statement and should not exist. I don't believe in participatory democracy filmmaking. Sure, the networks have their argument, but they just don't test the limits of it-they hate to take a chance on films like mine." 

When artists like Wiseman forsake the battle for commercial airtime, the fight for subjective and cinematic documentaries is left to tired critics and a few unhappy filmmakers. As the Poynter symposium illustrated, the debate is at an impasse damaging to both sides. 

The personal documentary is a form that now attracts the most innovative filmmakers, and one which-regardless of commercial television-will mature. Technological improvements, like less cumbersome and obtrusive equipment, have already made the personal documentary an accessible creative form. 

Because these films require only a cameraman and a director, the large network crews of the past are unnecessary. As a result, both local stations and private filmmakers can now produce documentaries. And innovations in transmission-video-tape cartridge systems or the long awaited cable television-will eventually provide a non-commercial forum for these films. 

But the commercial networks can grow along with the documentary. This would mean abandoning the pretense of objectivity, and freeing film from mere reporting. It would mean believing that the proper truth to broadcast is the sum, and not the lowest common denominator, of many subjective truths, and that the networks are forums for truths rather than arbiters of Truth. 

But more importantly, it would mean admitting the subjectivity of film and unmasking the artist who makes -and is-the documentary. 0
