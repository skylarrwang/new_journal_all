**In heat in England**

Universjty of Kent, Canterbury, 
England-All the friends who write 
from America seem terrifically con-
cerned about my health. Everyone 
wants to know how I manage to keep 
from dying without heat and 
electricity. 

Of course, I write back perpetuat-
ing the myth. Americans become 
disillusioned and alienated when 
they discover t hat the omnipotent 
newsmagazine gods have been lying 
to them. Editors and journalists 
are among the chosen few who can 
still convince people that life has 
order , so who am I to explode an-
other man's religion? I report that 
icicles hang from my radiator, ink 
freezes in my ball-point pen if I let 
it sit too long, I 'm going blind from 
reading by candlelight, 20 percent of 
the university has died of consump-
tion since January, and if the ice 
doesn't break soon we'll be driven to 
devouring the tawny flesh of our 
beloved mates. 

I can't wait until I have children 
and am able to impress them by tell-
ing them how I lived through the 
British Depression in the winter of 
1974. My imagination suggests hun-
dreds of Paul Bunyan stories as I sit 
here in my cozy, centrally-heated 
room with 500 watts of light glaring 
and my component system shaking 
the walls. 

There have been a few power cuts, 
but they lasted only a few hours be-
fore life-giving electricity was re-
stored. During one of them I was 
forced to leave a lecture, sacrificing 
the dubious pleasure of hearing a re-
cording of T.S. Eliot reading his 
poetry. (The genius could write, but 
he sure couldn't read very well.) And 
during a late-night cut everybody in 
the college wandered through the 
corridors seeking someone suitably 
warm to sleep with. 

More than anything else, the 
energy crisis has supplied us with 
material for endless hours of mind-
bending polemic discussion over 
pints of lager in college bars. Every 
Marxist on campus is eager to coat-
tail passersby to deliver a reasoned 
explanation of how Marx predicted 
thjs energy crisis 100 years ago and 
it is only through collective action 
now that the world can be saved. 

Meanwhile, every natural scientist in 
Great Britain is trying desperately 
to convince the authorities that his 
particular research is part of the new 
wave of "alternate technology" and 
will solve the nation's energy 
problems. 

Perhaps, as a member of an institu-
tionalized living complex complete 
with cleaners, cafeterias and social 
committees, I've been shielded from 
the brunt of the crisis. "People in the 
North are heating their sitting rooms 
with coal and sleeping with hot water 
bottles," an activist first-year co-ed 
revealed to me. "People in the North 
have always heated their sitting 
rooms with coal and slept with hot 
water bottles," I revealed to her. 

So where's the crisis? 

True, industry was on a three-day 
week. But no one is feeling the ef-
fects just yet. "It will take a few 
months," the experts tell us. But

Paul Erlich, champion as he is at in· 
stilling fear and panic into the 
masses, told us we would be walking 
on each other by 1975, too. Experts 
get paid for pulling panic levers, but 
ordinary people don't get paid for 
much of anything. (Not even for 
crawling through coal-infested tun· 
nels 12 hours a day.) So the British 
public strolls leisurely along, vague-
ly curious, waiting for the next new 
shortage and hoping someday they'll 
run out of politicians. 

The most irritating problem the 
average consumer faces in his day-to· 
day life is shops without lights. 
There exists somewhere in the laby· 
rinth of recent British " period of 
crisis" documents an elaborate 
series of lighting regulations. If you 
sell books you are under different 
regulations than if you sell food. 
Some shops have electricity three 
days a week, some four, and some 
even five days a week, but not during 
dinner or tea. I suspect the police 
here in Canterbury aren't even sure 
what the rules are, but at the begin· 
ning of January they slapped a 
couple of heavy fines on shops that 
could afford them. So now most 
shops do without lights. Instead, 
they post large placards reading, 
"We may not look like it, but we're 
open for business." 

Two days each week this university 
is under a "50 percent power regula-
tion." This means that on Tuesdays 
and Thursdays a little man with a 
ladder marches through the offices 
and corridors taking bulbs out of 
every other light socket. One won· 
ders if what they pay this man to do 
his job doesn't cost more than the 
electricity they save. 

And during the.first week of Feb· 
ruary the student's union occupied a 
building to protest the expulsion of a 
student. In the evenings the student 
marshalls patrolled the halls crying, 
"Switch off all lights. It is illegal to 
switch on any lights." I kept wonder· 
ing if it wasn't illegal to occupy the 
building, but I suppose everybody 
has to set his values somewhere. 

Imaginative commercial enter· 
prises have added their own twist to 
the crisis, turning it to profit as 
usual. An advertisement for "The 
Fuel-Crisis Motorist's Guide to See-
ing Europe" regularly nms in the 
newspapers. The aver,.ge British 
homeowner is encouraged to buy 
more insulation for his house because 
10,000 of the 20,()()()..odd kilowatt 
hours of electricity he uses to heat 
his house escape between the chinks 
in the walls. You can even buy a 
windmill for less than 200 pounds 
(450 dollars). 

A local gas board ran a contest in 
January asking participants to sug· 
gest ways of conserving energy. The 
winner was a lady who suggested 
that husbands and wives, lovers and 
anyone else so inclined take baths to· 
gether to save both water and heat. 
Well, the myth of the stiff and moral 
Britisher got a boost from the reac· 
tion around the country. Letters 
poured in to the newspapers declar· 
ing bathing together to be one of the 
Seven Deadly Sins. The House of 
Lords condemned the practice as im· 
moral, and someone reportedly over· 
heard the Queen remark, "We are 
not amused." 

In fact, Royalty has been right up 
on the front lines of the energy bat· 
tle, fighting with tooth and claw. 
When Princess Anne inspected pro· 
gress on her 20,000 pound (45,000 
dollar) five-bedroom house she was 
careful never to have on more than 
one light at a time. However, the 
price the country paid for her wed· 
ding could probably have paid for 
enough heat to warm the country 
through the winter of 1980, with 
enough left over to make a down· 
payment on the sun. 

Admittedly, the situation here in 
England will get worse. The miners' 
decision to call a national strike 
sparked a new battle in their continu· 
ing war with a Government deter-
mined to preserve the wealth and pri· 
vileges of the rich (under the pre-
tense of "the fight against infla· 
tion"). The effects of that battle will 
no doubt include more frequent and 
longer power cuts, which, for the mo-
ment at least, will mean less work for 
the British citizen, more drinking to 
keep warm, and much more sleeping 
and bathing together. 

But there will always be an 
England.O
