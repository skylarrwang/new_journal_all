quired to observe the Oxford gown-

ic gownsÂ·to classes and all official 
university functions), is particularly 
sensitive to the News' error, says 
Bennett, because it was the first 
private university in the South to 
voluntarily integrate its student 
body. So the university sued, and 
the News was put in the unhappy 
position of having to defend itself 
through the New York firm of Baker, 
Nelson & Williams. The suit could 
drag on for years. 

When the tired and frustrated 
1974 board members met las t fall 
to" choose their successors, it was 
clear that the once glorious Yale 
Daily News, "the old lady on York 
Street,'' needed a slug of Geritol. 
The OCD was in dire need of a 
thorough financial restructuring if 
they were to survive the financial 
stringencies of the sour '70's. But 
this already had begun through the 
efforts of a new business director, 
Matthew Coles (editorial page editor, 
1973), who assumed the brunt of 
Donahue's work last fall. Although 
Cole's Irish wit undoubtedly will not 
remain around the News as long as 
that of Francis Donahue, Coles has 
already begun to leave a distinctive 
mark on the organization. For tax 
advantages, he changed the News 
from a partnership arrangement to a 
non-profit corporation, eliminating-
at least for the immediate future-
the opportunity to earn big money 
on the News. (The News is the last 
Ivy League paper to do so.) He 
established a classified ads section, 
formalized office records which had 
been kept only in Donahue's head, 
and spearheaded a number of new 
OCD special projects, like the 
News!WYBC guide to rock music 
scheduled to appear in May. Special 
projects have traditionally made the 
most money for the News. 

In addition to Matt Coles, the 
News needed something it had 
missed for four years-a leader. Not 
a chairman who could snap his 
fingers and yell "Heeler!" for instant 
service, but an editor-in-chief who 
could integrate the various depart-
ments, rebuild the spirit and sense of 
craft in the paper. For that role, they 
elected Eli Spielman, a sports writer 
who had written only one news 
article prior to his election, but who 
has a quiet sense of vision, and a de-
sire to leave his stamp on the News. 

Today, Spielman must contend 
with a complex and diffuse mood on 
campus that seems to prevent any of 
Yale's formerly prominent extra-
curricular activities from assuming 
their lost status. Part of the demise 
of Yale's institutions arises from a 
renaissance of individtlalism, a flour-
ishin~ of small group activities and 
burgeoning of opportunities for more 
personal and less conventional ex-
pressions of achievement. In our 
bleaker moods, we have termed this 
grim professionalism, a narcissistic 
thrust, a desperate need for private 
time and private space and personal 
comfort- we cannot pin it down, but 
this is the drift, the flavor of what is 
around us. 

All this seems true in part, for 
many of us, punished by the '60's or 
having felt the punishment received 
by our older brothers and sisters, 
have withdrawn to private modes of 
established success, without feeling 
any internal struggle. Somehow, 
inexplicably, the movement got de-
railed, and we are waiting to see 
what happened ... 

But this is merely the surface 
phenomenon, and somehow, it smells 
of the need for explanation to the 
older generations. Grim professional-
ism has been progressing since 
World War II, with the flowering of 
corporations and the dramatized 
need for expert manpower; it is not a 
foreign trend. Besides, students, as 
individuals, respond to what is ex-
citing and good - adjectives most 
Yale activities have failed to inspire 
during periods of mass movements. 

If Eli Spielman can prove that the 
News is worth writing for again, 
grim professionalism will become 
known as sense of craft once more, 
and students will be back at 202 
York Street. 

And it appears as if Spielman has 
the energy and the perspective to 
meet the task. He works at the 
News until exhausted, but it is clear 
to him that he is happiest while 
working in journalism; academic 
courses remain a hobby and a 
luxury. He understands the needs of 
internal structure and discipline, but 
sees himself as a teacher, sensing the 
old undergraduate tradition of learn-
ing from one's peers, offering and inheriting a rich mode of thought, 
responses, and attitudes from one 
class to another. He recognizes the 
creative impulse that has spawned 
the Yale Daily News Magazine and 
the ability of the magazine and the 
daily paper to work in peaceful co-
existence-a cross-fertilization of 
interests- borrowing from each 
other's strengths rather than resent-
ing each other's limitations. He is 
concerned with News reporting as an 
expression of the thick and subtle 
issues on campus as well as a means 
for providing a service to Yale. 

All the dedication of Matt Coles 
and his band of Newsies will not 
bring back the old News: that exper-
ience has died, like the commie 
News. But the 1975 News may mark 
the beginning of a new era of good 
news-and when all else has passed, 
that is something worth saving for 
Francis Donahue's grandchildren.O
