What hope for the future?


The forced exile from the U.S.S.R. of Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn on February 13, following the publication of The Gulag Archipelago 1918-1956, offered an internationally-publicized example of the continuing repression faced by thousands of Soviet dissidents. Since the downfall of Khrushchev in 1963, the Soviet regime has attempted to silence the dissident movement through harassment, arrest and imprisonment of suspected dissidents; Solzhenitsyn's deportation is only the most recent episode in this campaign.


The New Journal asked three Yale professors who have studied and experienced conditions in the U.S.S.R. to comment on Solzhenitsyn's case and its implications for the future of the dissident movement. In the following excerpts, Wolfgang Leonhard, Adjunct Professor of History, discusses the main tendencies of the dissident movement; Victor Erlich, Bensinger Professor of Russian Literature, and Frederick Barghoorn, Professor of Political Science, describe the roots and the influence of Solzhenitsyn's work.


Leonhard: I think the top Soviet leadership had long discussions and even some disagreement on the question of how to deal with Solzhenitsyn. Of course, they all agreed that he had to be fought against (and all of them hated him). But most likely there was some disagreement of a purely tactical nature-what was the best way to handle him? I can very well imagine that some of the neo-Stalinists were in favor of an open trial. Other leaders probably felt that world opinion would react so strongly that some of the Soviet foreign policy aims might be endangered. Therefore, the method of forced exile was chosen. Similar methods have been used in the past two years. Some of the most famous dissidents, instead of facing trial, were permitted to go to the Western world-after which their passports were withdrawn. But we have to keep in mind that these are exceptions to the rule. Roughly, for any three Soviet dissidents who are exiled to the West, there are at least 50 who are tried in the Soviet Union. They are put in long term prison camps or into psychiatric clinics.


They decided to exile Solzhenitsyn for three main reasons. The first was to prevent a worldwide protest of public opinion. Secondly, to keep him out of the country while they colored his image for the Soviet population, to prevent his becoming a martyr for any resistance movement. Their final hope was that if Solzhenitsyn was in the West, world opinion would soon forget about him.


I personally think that there is a great possibility that his family will be permitted to leave. There is one thing that is of primary importance to the Soviet government: public opinion in the United States and Western Europe, and in particular the opinion of the intellectuals. The greater the protest in the West, the more hope there is for the dissidents. Conversely, the less we speak about them, the more they are endangered.


Most dissidents are trying to make as many contacts with the Western press as possible. In the early stages of the dissident movement, around 1965 and 1966, some dissidents were hesitant to have contacts with the Western press. But the majority of the dissidents are now of the opinion that they should try to make their cases as well known as possible. Although Solzhenitsyn is mentioned more than others, we should remember that many members of the dissident movement are not able to contact the press any more, because they are already in prisons, in camps, or in psychiatric clinics.


The dissident movement emerged around the spring of 1966. This was after a period of 11 years under Khrushchev, from 1953-1964, during which a certain de-Stalinization took place, a departure from Stalin's methods and a number of reforms; these 11 years were carried with the hope that, very gradually, the Soviet Union would begin to liberalize. In the first few months after Khrushchev's downfall in October, 1964, it seemed that this course would continue. But with the first arrests of writers in the Ukraine at the end of 1965 (in particular Chomovil) and with the arrest of Sinyavsky and Daniel in Moscow and the search of Solzhenitsyn's apartment in September, 1965, it was clear that re-Stalinization was beginning. The first important protest was a letter to the Soviet leadership opposing this tendency, signed by 29 famous intellectuals-natural scientists (including Sakharov), writers, even a ballerina. The letter strongly opposed the rehabilitation of Stalin and the return to Stalinism. From that time on, the dissident movement became stronger.


Members and activists of the movement have very much in common. They are all persecuted and suppressed. They are all against the bureaucratic dictatorship, Russification, and they advocate liberalization. But they would differ in their world outlooks, and in the particular formulation of their aims, and in the methods by which they want to achieve these aims.


I think that there are three main tendencies. One of these might be
