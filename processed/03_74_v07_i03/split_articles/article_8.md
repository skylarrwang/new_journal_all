**Author: Ted Hughes (as discussed by Charles Tomlinson)**
**Page number(s): 13**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Brings the legend of himself 
From before wars or burials, in spite of hounds 
and vermin-poles; 
Does not take root like the badger. Wanders, 
cries: 
Gallops alot;1g land he no longer belongs to; 
Re-enters the water by melting. 
He keeps fat in the limpid integument 
Reflections live on. The heart beats thick, 
Big trout muscle out of the dead cold; 
Blood is the belly of logic; he will lick 
The fish bone bare. And can take stolen hold 
On a bitch otter in a field full 
Of nervous horses ... 
Although Tomlinson's own very fine poetry exhibits a sensibility very different from Hughes', he 
was painfully fair to the purpose and achievement 
of the poem. And yet my clearest recollection is of 
two remarks which he appended almost casually 
to his reading. The first was that Hughes had 
learned a great deal from Lawrence, an observation that has permanently conditioned my re-
spo~sf' to the poems. The second observation had 
reference to the poem's delight in a certain order of 
feelmg, in the blood belly of logic, a relish that is 
almost audible in the lip-smacking of "He will 
lick/The fish bone bare." Tomlinson said that 
there was much in ' 'An Otter" of the sensibility 
that led to the building of the concentration 
camps. As a reaction to "Otter" this is surely an 
exaggeration; in light of Crow, I am inclined to 
agree. 
Although Selected Poems is ultimately a less interesting book than Crow, less original and 
achieved as poetry than the later work, it is the 
more humane volume of the two. From among 
several directions implicit as possibilities in his 
earlier work, Hughes progressively inclines to the 
dark and chilly path Tomlinson has all too accurately described. If Crow is anticipated in 
poems as early as "The Jaguar" , "Hawk 
Roosting" , and "Esther's Tomcat", unfulfilled 
promises are held out in "The Horses", in "Bull 
Moses", and especially in "Skylarks" (a longer 
poem from Wodwo (where, indeed, the promise is 
partially fulfilled. With its wierd echoes of 
Stevens and its strangely lyrical tone, "Skylarks" 
is ultimately uneven; mannered in some parts 
("Sing/ Obediant as to death a 1deadthing"), it is 
passionately and totally realized in others. Its 
importance, however, is that in it Hughes 
achieves a bala.nce he rarely reaches in Selected 
Poems, and has plainly chosen not to achieve 
again. It is a mixed singing, a vision of undeluded 
hope and sympathetic despair: 
0 song, incomprehensibly both ways-
Joy! Help! Joy! Help!
