have changed to semi-monthlies, or 
in other words, have become as 
newsy and approachable as the Lit., 
there has been an apparent neces-
sity of having an unpretentious 
sheet which should contain the 
latest news, and short, pithy ar-
ticles of interest. It is our purpose 
to publish such a sheet daily ... 
The mild-mannered issue sold for a 
nickel (an outrageous price) with the 
promise that the price would be low-
ered (it was) as soon as the paper was 
assured of financial success. Indeed, 
1it was a paying proposition from the 
start, and Bowen would write later 
that he and McDonald "always di-
vided at least ten dollars a week as 
net profits." Bowen, who ultimately 
went on to achieve the distinction of 
becoming ambassador to Venezuela 
under President McKinley, did all 
the writing, editing, proofreading 
and selling of advertising until his 
graduation in June. McDonald, 
whom his classmate William Howard 
Taft would remember as "an odd 
stick, with something of the fanatic 
about him," enrolled the News as a 
subscriber to the world's first com-
mercial telephone exchange, which 
opened in New Haven the same day 
the News was born. 

While the two sponsors wished 
their successors well, they apparent-
ly were content to let the News die 
after their departure. Nevertheless, 
John W. Keller '79, a writer for the 
..J 1878 publication, decided to relaunch 
the Yale News the following year as a 
"personal, individual venture" ; that, 
is, as almost a one-man editorial and 
fmancial operation. Not that the de-
mand for the OCD was overwhelm-
ing: Keller's classmates told him 
they were disgusted with the '78 
News, and the faculty were barely 
tolerant-one professor told Keller 
that "men did not come to college to 
conduct newspapers ." 

In spite of all that, " Bull" Kel-
ler felt he had "a taste for journal-
ism," and contracted a printer on the 
agreement that the printer would 
take all income from the publication 
while Keller would foot any losses. 
Thus, on January 9 , 1879, a second 
Vol. I, No.1 of the Yale News 
appeared-Keller would have 
changed the name, except for the ex-
pense of making a new copper plate 
for the title, and for the feeling that 
it was, after all, the correct name for 
such a publication. He was not as 
lucky as Bowen, however, and soon 
accumulated a large deficit. Al-
though he returned to New Haven 
the following fall, hoping somehow 
to recover his losses, Keller even-
tually gave up and went to New 
York, there to become a journalist 
struggling to pay off his debts. 

And so Keller left, while the News 
stayed to become the first college 
daily in the world (both Harvard and 
Dartmouth already had papers, but 
the OCD still claimed the title as the 
oldest college paper of continuous 
daily publication). During the next 
40 years, the News spearheaded a 
literary and journalistic renaissance 
at a college once known as a bastion 
of science, linguistics and theology. 
The OCD established itself as an 
organization for the " solid men," the 
campus managers. Heeling became 
an honorable profession: 30 to 70 
students would show up for the first 
News heel, which began after the 
Princeton game and continued for a 
number of grueling months, during 
which the heelers were reported 
never to have slept more than four 
hours a night. The heelers received 
points for selling ads, writing ar-
ticles, digging up unassigned stories, 
getting coffee for the editors, 
straightening up the office- the idea 
was to accumulate the most points 
and win the heeling competition, for 
the winner of the first heel often 
would become chairman, if he did not 
end up in the infirmary instead. 

Academic demands remained light 
during the early 1900's. Exams were 
considered " duck soup" if one 
simply studied his class notes. (In-
stead of special papers, "10-minute 
papers" covering the previous day's 
assignment were sometimes re-
quired.) Thus, when students were 
not involved in a heel, they lived-
and were expected to live-with a 
certain Elizabethan gusto-so much 
so that the 1914 N ews chairman was 
prompted to question why the Col-
lege was filled with so many "utterly 
shiftless bipeds. '' One surviving 
chairman of this period is fond of tel-
ling the story of a friend who, when 
congratulated on commencement 
day for having graduated from col-
lege, turned to the well-wisher and 
said: " My dear fellow, being con-
gratulated upon one's graduation 
from Yale is like taking a boat from 
Paris to New York and being con-
gratulated upon arriving at one's 
destination for not having fallen 
overboard.'' 

The Tiffany-and-Brooks-Brothers 
Yale that Briton Hadden and Henry 
Luce found when they came to-
gether from Hotchkiss was conser-
vative in thought and Republican in 
politics. When the two were fresh-
men, the News pulled its own version 
of " Dewey Defeats Trwnan": on the 
morning after Election Day, 1916, 
the editors decided to go to press 
without waiting for the California re-
turns, ~ssuming that Charles 
Hughes had defeated the Pri.nce-
tonian, Woodrow Wilson. They led 
their election extra with a banner 
headline: " Charles Hughes Elected 
President." 

As Yale became involved in the 
flurry of theW ar, prohibition, wo-
men's suffrage, Bolshevism, the free 
love movement, and F. Scott Fitz-
gerald's new novel about college life, 
Hadden and Luce were tapped by 
Skull and Bones and for two years 
led the Yale Daily News as chairman 
and managing editor, respectively. 
Three years after graduation, the 
two Bonesmen/ Newsies founded 
Time magazine, with a list of editors 
and contributors that read like a 
Yale College catalogue. Hadden 
would die six years later, but Luce's 
master stroke would remain in the 
minds of Newsies for decades after 
the founding of Time ; indeed, it was 
this entrepreneurial legend which 
seemed to give the News its special 
smell of ambition and success. 

By the time Yale's new president, 
James R{)wland Angell, arrived in 
1921, it was clear that in comparison 
to the chairman of the News, the 
president's role on campus would be 
modest. Like the presidents before 
and after him, Angell did not confer 
with undergraduates often, but when 
he did, he invariably met with the 
chairman. The two would discuss 
whatever was front and center for 
the day: pressing academic and na-
tional issues, and campus gossip. 
There were differences of opinion, of 
course, but it was all terribly polite. 
The chairman paid attention to the 
president because his comments 
could spark interesting editorials. 
And the president listened to the 
chairman because he was a spokes-
man for student opinion, a surrogate 
student body president for a student 
body that always refused to elect 
one. (Yale students have traditional-
ly been allergic to "sandbox 
democracy.'') 

While the chairman of the News 
wrote most of the editorials, he had 
little to do with running the daily 
paper. Held in awe by the under-
classmen, he was a powerful, almost 
a national, figure whose opinions 
held great weight (even as late as 
1967, when James Reston devoted an 
entire New York Times column to a 
discussion of the thoughtful and sen-
sible chairman, Strobe Talbot, who 
was arguing against the Vietnam 
War). The chairmanship was per-
haps the best job its holders would 
ever have: 1953 chairman James C. 
Thomson, now curator of the Nieman 
Foundation journalism fellowships 
at Harvard, recalls the time when an 
uncle who was editor of the Hartford 
Courant came to visit him at the 
News, and, struck by the plush quar-
ters and freedom from publishers 
and outside interference, assured 
Thomson that he would never have it 
so good again. 

One of the chairmen President 
Angell would meet was Carlos 
French Stoddard, Jr., w~o was a 
m ember of the class of '26, known for 
its vibrance and four freshman riots. 
" Tot" or "Tammany" Stoddard w~s 
a dedicated Newsie. As a heeler, he 
had seven papers delivered to his 
room so he could get up at 5:30 
a .m.-before the other heelers had got-
ten out of bed-to clip out articles for 
editorial suggestions . What bothered 
Stoddard most as he climbed to the 
chairmanship was the tradition of 
compulsory chapel attendance: it 
was no longer meaningful. Students 
would stumble into chapel every 
morning; sleep, study or read the 
N ews (which was in Yale Station by 
7:30) while the service rotely pro-
gressed through its daily pattern; 
and then stumble out again. 

Tammany Stoddard decided to do 
something about the anti-cllapel sen-
timents that had been building over 
the last 10 years-not through an 
angry crusade, but through a "rea-
sonable" approach. He deftly prod-
ded the campus with editorials. He 
invited the Yale Corporation to 
write out its defense of the morning 
misery. And he conducted a dining 
hall poll of undergraduates on the 
question. His findings: 241 in favor, 
1,681 against compulsory chapel 

At first, the faculty and Corpora-


--- Page 8 ---

tion balked, and voted to retain ·all 
existing chapel requirements. But 
the News eventually stumbled upon 
an article by a Harvard professor 
praising the voluntary system at 
Harvard's Appleton Chapel, adding 
that Yale's chaplain, Dean Charles 
Reynolds Brown, told him "he would 
rather preach at Harvard than any-
where else because he knows that he 
has a voluntary audience." Dean 
Brown suddenly reconsidered his 
previous support for compulsory 
chapel, and delivered an eloquent 
appeal for its elimination. Corpora-
tion member Rev. Henry Sloane 
Coffm (the present chaplain's uncle) 
was appalled; but the faculty took 
heart, and voted 29-12 to abrogate all 
chapel regulations. The Yale Corpo-
ration eventually affirmed this vote, 
and the victorious OCD claimed 
credit for effecting one of the most 
important educational changes at 
Yale before coeducation.

The Depression was actually a 
boon to the Daily News. Advertising 
was better than ever, and the News 
continued to earn healthy (or un-
healthy, depending on your ideology) 
profits: the 1932 board reportedly 
netted an astounding $27,000 during 
the very depths of the nation's 
slump. While the college remained 
soundly Republican, the mood on 
campus, as in the nation, swung to 
self-criticism. This change was not 
reflected as much in the News as it 
was in the birth of an explosive pub-
lication called the Harkness Hoot. 
The Hoot, established by two dis-
gruntled editors of the Lit., was a 
brilliant coterie of iconoclasts, loud 
in speech, brutal in analysis, unin-
hibited in its attack of old Yale 
values. Its writers seethed at Amer-
ican materialism, challenged the 
Gothic architecture plan for Yale, 
and called for an end to the senior 
societies. Founded in 1930, the Hoot 
lasted four years and was discon-
tinued by its sponsors, who thought 
it better to go out with a bang 
than to become another domesti-
cated Yale tradition. 

Perhaps the most significant 
change in the News at the time was a 
physical one: a moving of its offices 
from the basement of Fayerweather 
Hall in the Berkeley Oval (now Ber-
keley College) to its present Tudor-
style home at 202 York Street. 
Built by Luce as a memorial to 
Briton Hadden, the $100,000 offices 
were handsome, ample, even lavish. 
In his novel, The Paragon •. John 
Knowles (News editorial secretary, 
1949) wrote that the paper's board-
room, "because of the sober execu-
tive elegance of its paneling and its 
other appointments, could have 
made the directors of the United 
States Steel Corporation feel at 
home." Thirty years later, Luce, ever 
the visionary, would consider adding 
a wine cellar to the building, but 
Francis Donahue, among others, 
convinced him to refurbish the office 
instead. 

The 1930's produced an impressive 
string of Newsies: H.J. Heinz II, 
Jonathan Bingham, John Hersey, 
William Bundy, Sargent Shriver, 
William Scranton, and "King" 
Brewster, who began his climb for 
the chairmanship as Potter Stewart 
was ending his career as chairman. 
Like his predecessors, Brewster 
viewed the chairmanship as an am-
bassadorial, rather than a journalis-
tic, venture. Being chainnan did not 
necessarily indicate that one was the 
best journalist on the board (the 
managing editor ~sually was), nor 
did it indicate that one was aimed for 
a journalistic career. On the contra-
ry, until the mid-50's, most chairmen 
were expected to become scholars or 
statesmen-"men of affairs." It was 
the Harvard Crimson alumni who 
were supposed to go into mere re-
porting. William F. Buckley (the 
1950 chairman) was an exception, of 
course, but even he entered a career 
through an ideological approach and 
came out the journalistic end. 

For Brewster, the bright college 
years were ones of political preten-
sions, literary self-consciousness, 
and very sure feelings that what one 
was doing was terribly important-
"we were trying to save the world, 
not just Yale." (Perhaps this is why, 
30 years later, he was able to under-
stand the grand self-importance 
which Yale students attached to 
themselves during the Mayday 
spring of 1970-because Brewster
Volume seven, number tbreel March 26, 1974j 8 
himself knew the feeling too well.) 
Fearing that President Roosevelt 
was pushing the nation toward war 
"without a fair hearing and popular 
debate," Brewster joined the isola-
tionist America First movement, 
arguing that students should be al-
low~ to attend peace rallies, and 
even testifying before a congres-
sional committee that the U.S. 
should refrain from providing aid to 
Britain. 

Whatever the pretensions of the 
day, Brewster enjoyed his command 
at the News-and enjoyed it fully. 
He directed "distressingly little at-
tention to education" (although he 
claims his grades went up during the 
heel); spent a fair amount of time 
gossiping with President Seymour, 
looking for things to write about; 
and usually wrote three editorials a 
week-the three other editorials 
(there was a Saturday issue) being 
written by the vice chairman, who 
was Brewster's roommate, or the in-
coming chairman. One of the 
Brewster regime's most notorious 
editorials, which was to be quoted 25 
years later in Time, asserted that 
college girls should not be entitled to 
wear slacks: ''The women of Welles-
ley, Smith, and Vassar should be de-
prived of their pants." As chairman, 
Brewster naturally received credit 
for the editorial, but he claims he 
never wrote it. Perhaps, he says, it 
was his roommate ... 

The News was autocratic by na-
ture: a particular chairman's edi-
torial policy, however objectionable, 
could not be overturned by his 
board. In times of violent disagree-
ment, dissenting editorials and dis-
claimers appeared iri addition to the 
regular editorials; the letters-and-
editorial page frequently became a 
great battlefield. Francis Donahue 
recalls several instance$ when 
Buckley came to him saying, "no ads 
on the editorial page, Francis, I have 
a lot of anti-Buckley stuff to run." 
Although Buckley later reminisced 
that it was sometimes only through 
the support of his fellow Irishman, 
Francis, that he was not handed a 
vote of no confidence by his board, 
the freedom and integrity of the 
chairman remained unimpaired. The 
editorial page was provocative and 
thoughtful; people read it-could 
not help but read it. 

Like Buckley three years before 
him, James Thomson made the most 
of his editorial freedom as chainnan. 
In the face of a solidly Eisenhower/ 
Republican Yale, he waged a full-
scale campaign for Adlai Stevenson 
in 1952. While Thomson plastered 
the chairman's office on the second 
floor of the News building with 
Stevenson posters, his business 
manager (and close friend) covered 
the first floor with Eisenhower para-
phernalia. On September 29, 1952, 
Thomson presented a full-page 
editorial entitled, "The Time, the 
Place, and the Man." It began: 

Two months and two days after the 
close of the national conventions, 
there can be little doubt in the mind 
of the independent voter: the Amer-
ican people have seldom in their his-
tory been offered the chance to vote 
for a presidential candidate more 
ideally qualified for the staggering 
responsibilities of the job and more 
keenly aware of the crucial issues of 
the time. 

That candidate is Adlai E. Steven-
son. 

An FDR Democrat since childhood, 
Thomson found it great fun to run 
the News through the heart of the 
McCarthy era, when he could vent a 
certain righteous indignation and ex-
perience the "special esprit one gets 
from being in the minority and being 
right." 

Despite Thomson's liberal gusto, 
his fight for Stevenson ("the incarna-
tion of Independent Man"), his de-
fense of academic freedom and his 
plea for clemency for the Rosenbergs 
(who were convicted of espionage 
and sentenced to death), he was 
still working under the old Yale. 
Heeling still meant one had to give 
up going to classes and doing any 
academic work for several weeks. To 
Thomson, being chairman meant ma-
~ J 
joring in the News: getting up 
during late morning; going over to 
George and Harry's for breakfast; 
picking up the mail; conferring with 
the business manager and managing 
editor; perhaps meeting with Presi-
dent Griswold or Dean DeVane in 
early afternoon; then working on the 
editorials; breaking at 7 p.m. for 
martinis and dinner at Fence Club; 
going back to the News to work until 
1:30 or 2 a.m., with perhaps another 
break for steak sandwiches and beer 
brought in by the heelers; then to the 
room for a little bedtime reading be-
fore going to sleep around 2 or 3 a.m. 
The News still exuded the myth of 
opening up the secrets of power in 
America, of an extraordinary in-
volvement in the world of grown-
ups-which was important to the stu-
dents of the '50's, who had endless 
Q 
"soul talks" (bull sessions) about 
why people kept camng them the si-
lent generation. There was still an at-
mosphere of tweedy people and 
white-shoe society. Election to a top 
editorial seat on the News still meant 
earning a handsome bit of money: 
the three top offices-chairman, 
managing editor, and business 
manager-took half the year's prof-
its, which usually amounted to about 
$2,000 each. (This would increase to 
about $3,000 during the economic

boom of the mid-1960's, but would 
never match the huge sums earned 
during the 1920's and '30's, equiva-
lent today to salaries of about 
$10,000 to $12,000.) 

As G. Gaddis Smith (chairman, 
1954 and now master of Pierson 
College) put it: "We were the last 
classes of the 1920's, the last genera-
tion of students who acted the way 
their fathers did in college." 

3 
By the mid-1950's, however, the prep 
school tone of Yale slowly began to 
fade. When Calvin Trillin took over 
the chairmanship in 1956, Yale was 
still strongly entrenched in the old 
era, but in the midst of a transitional 
period; the freshmen who were to 
graduate with the Class of 1960. 
would reflect the mere tip of the mas-
sive social changes of the next de-
cade. For the moment, there was a 
cool, "preppy" feeling about the Col-
lege, even though there probably 
were more public than private school 
students attending Yale. Students 
were careful not to show overt ambi-
tion or too much enthusiasm-that 
was bad taste. 

Even through the non-coeducation 
years of the 1960's, the News re-
mained the strongest community at 
Yale, and the chairmanship was 
clearly the most important office on 
campus. Admittedly, the Newsies of 
the '50's would have been shocked to 
learn that members of the 1966 OCD 
board campaigned openly (again, 
bad taste) for the chairmanship for 
six weeks, meeting and eating lunch 
with fellow Newsies who had the 
power to vote. But as always, the 
News continued to take itself very 
seriously. To those involved with the 
paper, it seemed like the center of the 
Yale experience-a student govern-
ment, a media center, a social group 
and a power elite all rolled into one. 
Not only was there a certain headi-
ness one felt in belonging to the 
News, but a tremendous concern for 
craft. It seemed as though the sub-
limation which came out of the non-
coeducated community brought out 
an intense creativity, as well as the 
worst features of male competitive-
ness. 

Until the last chairman, Alan 
Boles, left office in 1968, the News 
maintained a strict heirarchy, with 
an environment of open. brutal com-
petition. People didn't climb to pow-
er over the backs of dead bodies, but 
even so, the politics of the climb took 
a heavy toll. The losers sometimes 
played by the "marbles rule": if you 
don't give me all the marbles, I'll 
take my marbles and go home." 
Others didn't: Doug Yates, who lost 
the chairmanship on the second bal-
lot in 1965, merely lost his taste for 
politics and pursued a career in aca-
demia instead. Elected vice chairman 
of the News, Yates became a Rhodes 
Scholar, worked several months as a 
London correspondent for Time, and 
then returned to Yale as an Assis-
. tant Professor of Political Science-
and watched his younger brother be-
come sports editor of a later News 
board. 

In spite of the growing student 
suspicion of consolidated, autocratic 
power, Newsies did not question the 
chairmanship, for students were still 
riding on a crest of self-importance-
a notion that they had a role to play 
for history-and it seemed worth-
while to have a strong leader to re-
flect that importance. At the same 
time, the News brand of journalism 
remained full of jokes and fun and 
camaraderie, memories that would 
remain vivid years after graduation. 
So at the end of the '60's, the News 
was still the best fraternity on a 
dwindling fraternity row. 

4 
And then came Mayday, 1970, the 
climax of several years of student 
activism, which swallowed the Col-
lege during three months of frenzy 
and rhetoric that seemed almost be-
yond belief in the face of today's 
Yale. The issue of the Panther and 
the Bulldog getting together created 
deep splits in the Yale community, 
and razed the highly hierarchical 
social structure of the college. A 
"higher" emotion-swept ideology 
blanketed the normally organization-
conscious Yale; once again, students 
in a piqued self-consciousness were 
confronting the great questions that 
their fathers had ignored. The prob-
lems, politics and prestige of the 
News were petty by comparison, 
almost ... laughable. And those who 
took the institutional status and 
autocratic discipline of the News 
seriously were more than floating 
anomalies; they were a clear and 
present danger to the revolution. 

The dazed OCD, unused to this 
severe second class citizenship in its 
own territory, began an intensive 
coverage of student strike activities. 
The managing editor, John Coots, 
gathered a staff of reporters, organ-
ized them in pairs, and sent them out 
with handfuls of dimes so that they 
could phone in developments in their 
areas every 15 minutes. Reporters 
were even stationed at the top of 
Kline Biology Tower, where, as one 
Newsie put it, viewing the strike 
activities was like watching "a foot-
ball game between the pigs and the 
freaks." 

Despite the emergence of a strike 
newsletter-an information and 
propaganda sheet created by "the 
people" of Yale-the News' coverage 
of Mayday spring was broad, 
brilliant in spots, and more accurate 
than a.ny other newspaper: like the 
News of the civil rights '60's, the 
modem OCD proved it could rise 
to the challenge. Nevertheless, the 
reportage of the News was objective 
at a time when objectivity was not 
considered "relevant." And its edi-
torial policy was hopelessly divided 
over the strike at a time when the 
Yale community pressured for soli-
darity. 

At one point, a group of strikers 
carrying flaming toilet paper rolls 
threatened to trash the News buil-
ding; but the real concern of the pa-
per was not a threat from the out-
side, but a collapse from the inside. 
A year before Mayday, the News 
board decided to abolish the vener-
ated position of chairman and estab-
lish a ruling order more in spirit with 
the growing current of radicalism: 
that is, six smaller boards (news, 
business, photo, administration, edi-
torial, and publications) which would 
operate as "communes" of power, 
with no one person in charge of each 
board. While the "commies," as 
Francis Donahue called them, ful-
filled the philosophical demands for a 
more democratic decision-making 
process, everyone knew that they did 
not work very well; the democracy 
was too ill-defined, and-like many 
Yale organizations-had too many 
leaders. 

A return of the chairmanship was 
out-at one time, the drive for the 
"King's" slot was the great lure for 
students, but now, most staffers 
felt that too many people worked too 
hard on the paper for there to be one 
individual who held all that power. 
So over the next three years, the 
News retained the commie system 
only in name, 'With each board con-
trolled by a particular editor who 
was not necessarily responsive to a 
communal decision-making process. 
The king was dead, and power was 
consolidated in the hands of feudal 
lords, but there was still the problem 
ofoverallindirection.The1971board 
produced a working structure that 
one Newsie called "The Flying 8 and 
The Fabulous 50," a handful of dedi-
cated individuals who did most of 
the day-to-day work with several 
dozen unreliable board members. 

Just before the election of the 1974 
board, the News decided to become a 
"features paper" as well as a news-
paper, thus establishing the posi-
tions of news managing editor and 
features managing editor, and 
changing the format of the paper 
from a New York Times front page 
to a tabloid style. Neither Bradley 
Graham, the 1974 news managing 
editor, nor Richard Fallon, the fea-
tures managing editor, had sover-
eignty; what resulted was a con-
tinual battle over jurisdictional 
rights, with such bitter resentments 
and disorganization that many 
Newsies felt there was once more a 
need for an overall guiding hand. 

Along with the crisis in power 
came a crisis in product; the daily 
newspaper contained poor reporting, 
sloppy editing, shabby layouts. Stu-
dents did not seem to care about be-
longing to the News, and developed 
an "ad hoc" attitude, doing an ar-
ticle or some hasty editing, and then 
leaving for some other pursuit. To 
aggravate matters, it suddenly ap-
peared that the News, always a guar-
anteed moneymaker, was in deep fi-
nancial trouble. After clearing pro-
fits of $17,000 in 1970 and $9,000 in 
1971, the paper unexpectedly found 
itself $3,000 in the red. Lucrative 
national advertising in the News 
plunged as big advertisers, like ciga-
ret companies, began looking for 
mass-circulation markets. Printing 
costs were increasing by 10 per cent 
each year. 

To add to its problems, the News 
found itself involved in a half-million 
dollar libel suit over an item that ap-
peared in one of its special publica-
tions, An Insider's Guide to the 
Colleges-a collection of pithy re-

according to the university's vice 
chancellor, J. Jefferson Bennett. The 
sheet simply contained a reprint of 
the original review, omitting the 
erroneous lines, but did not inform 
the reader of the exact nature of the
