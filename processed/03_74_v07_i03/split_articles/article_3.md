For a few brief hours on the evening 
of May 4, 1973, it was almost like old 
times for the Yale Daily News, once 
"the best fraternity on fraternity 
row." On that night, 400 of Yale's 
best and brightest- that long Blue 
line of well-bred and successful 
Newsies-gathered in New Haven to 
revive the grand tradition of the an-
nual News banquet. It always had 
been the social event of the year, sat-
urated with a sea of black ties, with 
an easily-found elegance that comes 
with easily-found money, with the 
smells of power and impending pow-
er, with the feeling of belonging to ... 
well, the elite of the elite.


All this had been misplaced in the 
recent sweep of student unrest. Like 
most institutions, the News felt the 
battering of anti-institutional senti-
ments, both from within and with-
out, and the diffusion of both the 
good and bad notions which had kept 
the paper intact for 90 years. But the 
rashness and disrespect of youth was 
forgotten that night, as 400 Yale 
men (and alas! a handful of Yale wo-
men) came to honor Francis M. 
("Tacky") Donahue, the spirited 
Irish business director who was re-
tiring after 50 years of service to the 
News. Donahue had come to the 
News as a 14-year-old office boy in 
1923 after his father died and left 
seven children without support; not 
only did he eventually coordinate all 
of the paper's advertising accounts, 
he became a symbol of continuity 
amid change, a critical father as well 
as a gentle advisor and confidant to 
the endless string of "his boys."


So the 92nd News banquet was a 
"thanks for the memories": a leisure-
ly cocktail hour in the red-carpeted 
President's Room of Woolsey Hall, 
followed by a handsome meal of 
roast rib of beef and Beaujolais, 
Idaho potatoes and asparagus with 
lemon and butter sauce, vanilla nut-
roll with hot fudge topping. Admit-
tedly, some of the old grace had been 
lost. Some of the younger Newsies 
wore rented, not owned, tuxedos; 
some laughed a little too loud; a 
young lady took it upon herself to 
smoke a cigar.


All in all, however, it was a fine 
affair. President Nixon sent his re-
gards through White House Ad-
visor Jonathan Rose, chairman of 
the 1963 News board. The alumni of 
happy, golden by-gone days ex-
changed views with their younger, 
brassier successors-most of them 
no brighter than their elders, but per-
haps more interesting and question-
ing, less serene, but less smug. For 
wit and charm and eloquence, no one 
could match Francis' favorite chair-
man, William F. Buckley, Jr., who, 
in that manner only his own, gave 
the audience an object lesson in just 
how the English language should be 
shaped and spoken. He neatly skew-
ered two of his favorite targets, 
President Brewster and Yale Chap-
lain William Sloane Coffin; remi-
nisced over a warm and well-remem-
bered Yale past; appealed to the 
young for adherence to standards 
and devotion to craft; and celebrated 
the guest of honor as "first among all 
who have appeared at these ban-
quets, in the affection and admira-
tion of this company." And when 
Francis M. Donahue was presented 
with an inscribed silver cup and as-
surances that $80,000 had been 
raised to buy a monthly annuity for 
him and his wife, there was little left 
to say.


Although The New York Times re-
ported the next day that the banquet 
might indicate a partial return to the 
"old boy" school, it seemed clear 
that time had been peeled away only 
for the night. The 1973 News ban-
quet was in fact a last supper-not a 
hint of the future, but the end of an 
age. There would be other News ban-
quets, but the old News, like the old 
Yale, was dead, perhaps for the bet-
ter.


The question was: what would be 
the new meaning of the News, the 
News without the Francis Donahue 
myth, without the magic of the chair-
manship, without the 80-hour-a-week 
heel, the big profits, the recognition, 
the promise of success? What was 
the long term prospect for the Oldest 
College Daily in the face of inflation-
ary costs; the loss of lucrative na-
tional advertising accounts; an intro-
verted student body concerned more 
with its academic performance than 
its extracurricular experiences? And 
what of the half-million-dollar libel 
suit filed against the News for an er-
ror made in the paper's 1973 edition 
of the Insider's Guide to the Col-
leges?


The answers are obscure; they al-
ways seem to emerge from our blind 
side. But as Yale's 1974 admissions 
committee chooses the class that will 
govern the 100th board of the Yale 
Daily News, one thing is certain: the 
future weighs heavily on the achieve-
ments of one particular Eli-Eli 
Spielman, the present editor-in-chief 
-and his band of merry (and not so 
merry) Newsies.

Nicknamed the Oldest College Daily 
(OCD), the News is just that-more 
or less. Vol. I, No. 1 of the Yale News 
made its appearance on January 28, 
1878, after a Yale senior named Her-
bert W. Bowen became convinced 
that Yale should have a daily paper. 
Having obtained financial backing 
from classmate Frank V. McDonald 
("whose purse was always full"), 
Bowen decided to pursue the experi-
ment. The first four-page issue began 
with a statement of purpose that 
would reflect the restless notions of 
students throughout the following 
decades, and even to the present 
day: 

The innovation which we begin by 
this morning's issue is justified by 
the dullness of the times, and by the 
demand for news among us. Ever
