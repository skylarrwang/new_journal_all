**Title: Flying the black flag of himself: A Review of Ted Hughes' poetry**
**Author: John Romano**
**Page number(s): 12**

Ted Hughes' reputation is only to a small extent a product of the three volumes from which the poems in Selected Poems were chosen: The Hawk in the Rain (1957), Lupercal (1960), and Wodwo (1967). Rather, it is based primarily upon his fourth book, Crow, which was published in this country with enormous impact in 1971. It was perhaps the most widely discussed new book of poetry to appear in England or America since the posthumous appearance of Sylvia Plath's book, Ariel (1966). It has been held in such esteem that, especially among writers of poetry, no poet is more frequently named as the most considerable contemporary talent. 

This judgment is a controversial one at a moment when Lowell and Merwin and Ammons are alive and busy, especially in circles where the taste for poetry is all but dominated by an admiration for the later Stevens. The judgment is not my own, but Hughes' prominence should not surprise us, for all that. Crow does offer much of what readers of recent poetry have been particularly starved for: a direct address to the senses, an impression of sheer power unhampered by self-consciousness-a left to the body under a clear blue sky, or is it a black sky? Consider the hairiness: 

Flogged lame with legs 
Shot through the head with balled brains 
Shot blind with eyes 
Nailed down by his own ribs 
Strangled just short of his last gasp 
By his own windpipe 
Clubbed unconscious by his own heart 
Dragged under by the weight of his guts 
("A Kill") 

Even when the vision repels, the voice is irresistible: 

Crow saw the herded mountains, steaming in the morning. 
And he saw the sea 
Dark-spined, with the whole earth in its coils. 
He saw the stars, fuming away into the black, 
mushrooms of the nothing forest, clouding 
their spores, the virus of God. 
And he shivered with the horror of Creation. 
("Crow Alights") 

Perhaps inevitably, the lucidity is misleading. It is secretly tenebrous, if openly ironic: 

God tried to teach Crow how to talk. 
" Love," said God. "Say, Love." 
Crow gaped, and the white shark crashed into the sea 
. 
And went rolling downwards, discovering its own depth. 
"No, no," said God, "Say, Love. Now try it. LOVE." 
Crow gaped, and a bluefly, a tsetse, a mosquito 
Zoomed out and down 
To their sundry flesh-pots. 
("Crow's First Lesson") 

It ls also man-hating and God-hating: 

Crow laughed. 
He bit the Worm, God's only son, 
Into two writhing halves. 
He stuffed into man the tail half 
With the wounded end hanging out. 
("A Childish Prank") 

and crisply woman-hating: 

He lifts a chair-fear lifts him-
He smashes the egg-shell object to a blood-rag, 
A limping sprawl, he tramples the bubbling mess. 
The shark-face is screaming in the doorway 
Opening its fangs. 
("Crow's Account of St. George") 

Along with the, er, refreshing qualities of the voice, Crow offers some of the interest of narrative, characters and events, next to which the "confessional" poet's divulgences pall. Like Zarathustra, a palpable influence, or like Clint Eastwood, whom he resembles in a different way, the waggish, implacably violent anti-hero of the poems has undeniable, if ghastly, charisma. What he evokes is rooted in the most appalling recesses of our being, and if it isn't entirely pleasant it is nonetheless instructive. Though I hesitate to use the term "authenticity," I think it is to some extent true that we read ourselves when reading Crow, and there is merit in that. But this acquainting of the self with the self sharply restricts the matters Hughes can put before us. For Crow, as for Zarathustra, philosophy and style are one; when we have once heard the cry of Crow, and its echo within us, we know all he can teach us. 

This is perhaps a reflection of Hughes' inestimable debt to D.H. Lawrence, and if so it is not an entirely flattering reflection; his is an art that instructs through the blood, but that which the blood can know seems, at times, remarkably limited: 

Who owns these questionable brains? Death. 
All this messy blood? Death. 
These minimum-efficiency eyes? Death. 
This wicked little tongue? Death. 
This occasional wakefulness? Death. 
Who owns the whole rainy, stony earth? Death. 
Who owns all of space? Death. 
("Examination at the Womb-Door") 

So far I have been guilty of confusing the voice of Crow with that of the poet, where the school-trained sense of a reader of poetry will tell him that the meaning of Crow may only be adjudged by a scrupulous calibration of the distance between the two. But perhaps A. Alvarez is right that very few of our prepared approaches to poetry will be of avail in confronting Hughes' "Extremist" work, though he errs in thinking it the finest thing in the world. Such a sweeping view of the iconoclasm of the volume may well explain my sense that the poet-narrator is himself a casualty of Crow's aggressive nihilism. Not that Hughes is Crow himself, but rather that the distance between Hughes and Crow cannot be measured within the poems at all. 

The implications of such a thought remind me of a lecture delivered in 1968 by Charles Tomlinson, another British poet. His topic was British poetry
