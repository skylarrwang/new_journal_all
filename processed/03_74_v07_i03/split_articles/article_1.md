"I taught our next President, Gerald Ford," said Myres Smith McDougal, Sterling Professor of Law, "and Governor William Scranton, who I thought would be President. Also Justices Potter Stewart and Byron White, and Nicholas Katzenbach. Those two were my brightest-White and Katzenbach.'' McDougal wore a green printer's visor, and his eyes, almost blind from two detached retina operations, peered through thick-lensed glasses. "Ford was a good B-plus student," he said of the Vice President. "He's a lot smarter than people think. I just wish he would keep his mouth shut."


Myres Smith McDougal sat in an office that felt as if it belonged in Mississippi a long time ago. The atmosphere, like McDougal's accent, had a refined Southern tinge. Books, articles, documents and reports were piled in disarray on desktops, against walls, in bookshelves and in front of windows until they almost shut out the light. The office had the dusty yet not dusty feel of an antique shop whose furniture remains as strong as the day it was built.


McDougal sat amidst the gloom and legal clutter preparing for his last term as a teacher of "Public Order in the World Community" -a system of thought known throughout the world as McDougal International Law.


In his 40 years of teaching, McDougal has written five books on international law, two books on property law, and countless articles. Two of his latest books deal with the newborn fields of undersea and outer-space law.


Myres McDougal parted with his memories gingerly, almost as if he were afraid he was imposing them. The son of a country doctor, he was born in 1906 in Burton, Miss.-a town so small that the post office has disappeared. In 1922 he entered the University of Mississippi at Oxford. Faulkner country.


"I saw Faulkner often back then," said McDougal, remembering his undergraduate days. "He was somewhat older than I, and when I attended Ole Miss he held the position of University Postmaster. And I can tell you this-he was a bad post-master, just terrible. He was alleged to say to students, 'Why the hell do I have to get your mail?' and then not get it. I took freshman English from an instructor who was said to have flunked Faulkner. Faulkner never participated in the major literary clubs, and he had brothers who were a lot more popular, good athletes and the like. Many people thought Bill a screwball.


"Faulkner used to stroll around the campus wearing a French beret and carrying a cane. He would make a special point of walking on the grass instead of the paths. Only one man I knew, a young lawyer, thought Faulkner was destined for greatness. He often said that the day would come when we all would be proud to have known him. We thought this just ridiculous."


McDougal, who hadn't read Faulkner in thirty years, echoed the old Southern school of Faulkner criticism, "I don't deny he was a powerful writer, but he exaggerated the depravity of a great many people. People we all knew. If you lived in a small town in the South you couldn't help knowing everybody. As a child I used to go with my father on calls to Negroes' and poor sharecroppers' homes. Faulkner's view differed from mine and from a lot of other people's, too."


"Senator James D. Eastland of Mississippi was a classmate of mine," said McDougal. "I was the editor of the school newspaper and he was the business manager. We both had high hopes for political careers. Senator Eastland's family made money from land and mine lost it, so I went off to England to learn law in order to make a living.


"Why law? A process of elimination mostly. At the time, there were only three respectable professions in the South: medicine, law, and the ministry. My father was a country doctor, a very successful one, and I didn't want to compete with him. The ministry was out, so that left only the law."


Later in his career, McDougal occasionally would ask Senator Eastland to support various proposals. On one occasion Eastland ("In characteristic loyalty to friends," said McDougal) simply said, "Myres, you just dictate the particulars in a letter-I don't care what they are-and I'll sign it."


After graduation, McDougal taught Latin and Greek for a time at Ole Miss before receiving a Rhodes Scholarship to study law at Oxford, England. Then, after teaching at the University of Illinois for three years, he moved to the Yale Law School, where he thought he was to work in business law with Professor William O. Douglas. But Abe Fortas, who had worked previously with Douglas, arrived to fill that position, so McDougal was forced into land law-and ended up liking it. He denied that his family's misfortunes in land dealings had anything to do with his choice.


One thing perplexed him about Northern life. "When I moved to New Haven in 1934," he said, "there used to be stables and a lot of horses in East Rock Park. Neighbors would ask me why I never rode for pleasure. Why hell, I rode so many horses before I was fifteen I never wanted to ride another again. Riding was work back then, I just couldn't understand doing it for fun."


"In my younger days," McDougal recalled, "I wanted to do everything-that's why I went into government." In 1942 he went to Washington to become Assistant General Counsel of the Lend Lease Administration. In 1943, Governor Herbert Lehman appointed him General Counsel of the Office for Relief and Rehabilitation in the State Department. "Most legal jobs are dull and pedestrian," McDougal added. "I found that a good part of the time is spent wrangling over money, or arguing with the Civil Service over who you can or can't hire, or problems with the G.A.O. My boss held so many positions, half the time I didn't even know whose payroll I was on."


He reflected over the mention of Franklin Roosevelt, and smiled. "There is little doubt that anybody from my generation thought F.D.R. a great man. I never worked with him, only men who worked for him. One story I heard about him involved a man who complained that other bureaus seemed to be doing the same task as the complainant's. President Roosevelt replied, 'I figure if I give the same job to five different people, at least one should get it done."


In 1944 McDougal returned to Yale to teach.


An incredible array of Supreme Court Justices, Congressmen, governors, and other members of the power elite have passed through the Yale Law School and McDougal's office en route to illustrious careers. He admits to no jealousy, just intense pride in their accomplishments. He remains close friends with many of them, including Justice White.
