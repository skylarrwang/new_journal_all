When the spring thaw of 1982 revealed several 
bodies frozen to death under a New Haven 
bridge, a group of Yale students organized a 
homeless shelter through Dwight Hall. The students used a 
church as a temporary facility while they consulted appro-
priate city and county officials on legal matters and polled 
neighborhoods to find a community that would support the 
shelter. By November, Columbus House opened its doors, 
and a board of New Haven residents took over its manage-
ment. 


Columbus House is only one of a multitude of social ser-
vice programs born and nourished in Dwight Hall. A clear-
inghouse for over 100 student community service projects, 
Dwight Hall provides a vital link between the Yale and New 
Haven communities. "Dwight Hall is an important way for 
student initiative and community initiative to connect," said 
Hari Osofsky (DC '93), Dwight Hall co-coordinator. 


Jack Hasegawa brings day-to-day continuity to Dwight Hall. 
William Johnston, Program Director of Columbus 
House, regards Dwight Hall as a valuable source of volun-
teers for public service projects. New Haven community 
leaders appreciate the personal strength and energy of the 
individuals Dwight Hall brings to the community. "The 
people from Dwight Hall participate out of genuine con-
cern, as opposed to public relations," said Shawn Garris, 
Assistant Director of Dixwell Community House. 


Dwight Hall opened its doors as the Christian Social 
Union of Yale in 1879 under the guidance of evangelist 
Dwight L. Moody, and flourished as a religious center 
throughout much of its history. In an informal agreement 
with the Yale administration in 1886, the Dwight Hall 
Cabinet received its present building. "Dwight Hall owned 
everything inside the paint, and Yale owned everything out-
side," explained Jack Hasegawa, General Secretary of 
Dwight Hall. As the Yale YMCA, Dwight Hall sponsored 
numerous social missions. Eventually, the organization 
shed its religious affiliations for purely social concerns in 
response to the changing religious demography of the stu-
dent body. "The Dwight Hall of today still has lofty goals, 
but of a more secular nature," said Edith MacMullen, a 
member of the Board of Directors. 


Dwight Hall founded such New Haven establishments 
as Halfway House and Columbus House, and maintains an 
active role in on-campus social change as well. Freshperson 
Conference, the Freshman Counselor system, and even 
Yale's current co-educational status grew from Dwight Hall 
roots. Over 2000 students participate in service programs 
run through Dwight Hall. "It is probably the largest single 
undergraduate activity at Yale," said Hasegawa. 


Despite its close ties to both Yale and New Haven, 
Dwight Hall remains a financially and legally independent 
non-profit organization. An endowment provides approxi-
mately half its $4 million budget, and an annual fundraising 
drive begun in 1919 yields the rest. The organization thus 
occupies a unique niche between Yale and New Haven, 
serving more as a member of both communities than as dis-
tinct from either. 


Because of its campus location, Dwight Hall enjoys 
advantages ranging from exemption from liability insurance 
to more luxurious benefits, such as enhanced attraction for 
speakers at Dwight Hall events. "Dwight Hall does not 
have to be limited by or worried about conflicts with the 
policies of Yale," said MacMullen. "But it does get the ben-
efits of being perceived as part of Yale, as 
well as the physical benefits." Dwight Hall 
leaders appreciate those perks, but also 
cherish their independence. Janet Molloy 
(BR '92), 1991 Dwight Hall Cabinet 
coordinator, believes that the center would 
lose its effectiveness if Yale ran it. "It 
would become a sort of mouthpiece for 
Yale, and perhaps be required to follow an 
agenda that Yale set forth," she said. 
"Being separate from Yale is vital to 
Dwight Hall's functioning." 


Cabinet member Sarah Davidson (TC 
'92) also cites Dwight Hall's independence 
as 
the 
reason 
for 
its 
success. 
"Independence gives Dwight Hall the lib-
erty to become a political institution if it 
wants, and to take a position on university Dwight Hall student coordinators Brandi Clark (UE '93), Hari Osofsky (DC 
affairs," she said. When Dwight Hall voiced '93), and Stefan Pryor (SM '93) serve as liaisons between Yale and New Haven. 
concerns about the safety of volunteers who 
had to walk to New Haven work sites, the university denied 
financial assistance for student transportation. Dwight Hall 
criticized the university's policy and drew from its own funds 
to buy a van. 


Davidson suggested that Dwight Hall's division from 
Yale also makes the organization less intimidating to com-
munity members, thus fostering better Yale-New Haven 
relations. She claimed that "We the People," the alliance 
formed by Yale students and the homeless of New Haven to 
fight state budget cuts, might not have attracted homeless 
support if the university had been officially involved. 


Another advantage to Dwight Hall's autonomy became 
apparent in mid-February when it provided a relocation site 
for many classes during the three-day union strike. "We 
have frequently been in the middle of a variety of controver-
sies that have nothing to do with us," said Hasegawa. 
"There's a customary wisdom that Dwight Hall is neutral 
territory during a strike." Offering a calm, buffered atmo-
sphere, Dwight Hall often facilitates communication 
between disputants. 


Stefan Pryor (SM '93), co-coordinator of Dwight Hall 
Cabinet, described Dwight Hall's position as one of active 
neutrality. "We can take the role of off-campus space when 
necessary, but clearly we're on campus," he said. By encour-
aging communication, Pryor believes that Dwight Hall 
takes an active role in social and political issues. "In issues 
of service and advocacy, we're not neutral," he said. Dwight 
Hall-sponsored groups like "We the People" regularly lobby 
for legislation on the local, state, and even national levels. 


Officially, the Board of Directors bears responsibility 
for Dwight Hall, dealing with legal concerns and offering 
APRIL 10, 1992 
guidance to the student-run Dwight Hall Cabinet; the 
staff, headed by Hasegawa, functions as a middle ground 
between students and the board. Because the board meets 
only twice a year, much of the authority of Dwight Hall 
passes to the students. The Dwight Hall Cabinet, which 
usually numbers around 20 students, has met weekly every 
year since 1882. At these meetings, which take place in a 
round table format with the cabinet coordinators moderat-
ing, students make most of the decisions about Dwight 
Hall's functions, including the allocation of funds among its 
various organizations. 


Dwight Hall volunteers continually initiate new projects 
and programs, making student leadership an essential com-
ponent of the center. "Students have no boundaries," 
Hasegawa said, noting that they often become intensely 
devoted to their projects. One day he received $1200 worth 
of camping and hiking supplies for Outdoor Corps, an orga-
nization which brings together Yale students and inner-city 
New Haven youth for companionship and recreation. The 
group's founder had received the Dwight Hall Humanitarian 
Services Award and funnelled the money back to her group. 


Community activists from both Yale and New Haven 
agree that Dwight Hall offers both the lessons and the 
rewards of involvement in community service. Students can 
pursue projects of their choosing and learn the practical 
aspects of developing and maintaining a program while 
enjoying a sense of personal accomplishment. 


"What's 
touched me the most is the interaction I had with the kids," 
said Davidson. "When you feel you've made a difference in 
someone's life, it's an incredible feeling."
