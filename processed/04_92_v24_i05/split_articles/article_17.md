t all started in 1950 with a $300 prize from a church raf-
fle and a lucky coincidence. Lew Beckwith Sr., a 41-year 
old sometime bartender-waiter, happened to be working 
for the Monarch laundry company just when they wanted to 
sell their store-front on Elm Street. With the raffle prize and 
a few loans, Lew Sr. bought the building and started a lunch-
counter hamburger joint, the Yankee Doodle Dandy, which 
would become a New Haven landmark and a favorite eating 
spot fo:: the Yale and New Haven community. 

Lew Jr. was 12 at the time and his father put him to work 
washing dishes every minute that the boy was not in school. 
Now Lew Jr. is just Lew, an.d he is the owner, maitre d', short-
order cook, floor sweeper, and waiter at the 12-seat establish-
ment. He started his own daughter, Darlene, working Â·at the 
Doodle when she was 12, and now she is his only employee, 
officially the waitress, though if Lew has a second to spare he 
will ask a customer directly, "What can I get for you?" 

Above Lew and Darlene's heads hang signs advertising 
the Doodle's low prices; the top dollar item is the "Dandy 
Doodle Double Double Cheeseburger on a hard roll, L&T, 
with onions and bacon-$3.00." Like the prices, the decor 
seems more 50s than 90s, from the ancient "Drink Coca-
Cola" clock in one corner to the vintage manual cash regis-
ter. Le""w still uses the same equipment that his father 
bought when he opened the store, from the Toastmaster 
toasters to the Tidy Nap napkin holders. Throughout the 
decades, countless customers have worn off the counter's 
finish as they leaned over to pay their bill and exchange 
pleasantries with Lew. 

Lew spends his day dancing a two-step between a grill 
about the size of two cafeteria trays and a wooden counter.-
He cooks everything on the grill or on a single burner to its 
right; the back burner always holds a plate piled with bacon. 
From his spot in front of the counter Lew can reach all the 
foodstuffs he needs to prepare everything on the Doodle 
menu, from sliced cheese, tomatoes, and ham to a nutri-
tionist's worst nightmare;- pigs-in-blankets-hot dogs 
stuffed with cheese and wrapped in bacon. 

Although the restaurant hasn't changed since 1953-
when Lew's father moved the counter from one side of the 
store to the other, to add two stools that expanded the avail-
able seating by 20 percent-the world outside has changed 
quite a bit. The country has gone off the silver standard. 
(The first bill the Doodle earned, taped in Lew's scrap book, 
bears the legend "In silver payable to bearer on demand.") 
Prices have gone up-"Yeah, prices change," says Lew. 
"Usually once a year I go up five cents on everything." Yale 
went coed. "I didn't like to see the change. But now I'm 
glad because it's better this way." Lew also remembers 
"when there were 8:00a.m. and Sarurday classes, and when 
they wore jackets to dinner. Nowadays if you're a senior 
and you've got a class on Friday you did something wrong." 

Lew saw John Kennedy's motorcade drive right by the 
Doodle on the way to the president's speech on the green. 
A few years later he boarded up his windows as a precaution 
against riots during the Black Panther trials of 1970. 

Through it all the Doodle has stayed open, winning 
devotees in Yale and New Haven. Lew reminisces about the 
late Bart Giarnatti, who used to come in for a burger even 
after he left Yale to become Commissioner of Baseball. 

History Professor Jonathan Spence, who considers the 
Doodle an essential contributor to Yale's status as a great 
research university, ate his first meal in New Haven at the 
Doodle when he arrived from England in 1959. "The 
Yankee Doodle is for when you need a quick meal and an


Except for his two annual 12-day vacations, one at 
Christmas and one in July, Lew has kept the Doodle 
open almost without pause for its 42-year existence. 
"I was closed for a couple of days when my father died and 
for a couple days when Darlene's other grandfather died. I 
had to go into the hospital twice for operations, but the first 
time I postponed the operation until my son was off f~r the 
summer and he kept it open for me. T he second ume I 
postponed it until he could take his vacation from work." 

The Doodle used to stay open until midnight, but Lew has 
eased back in recent years, cutting the hours to the current 
6:30 a.m. co 2:30 p.m. He stiH arrives at 4:~0 eve~ morn-
ing to make the coffee and light the stove. That gtves me 
about a half hour to read the paper and get a cup of coffee 
myself." Then comes the first of three daily rushes-two 
breakfast rushes, one from 6:30 to 7:30, another from 9:00 
to 10:00, and a lunch rush that starts around noon. 

The seasons also bring an ebb and flow of business into 
the Doodle. "Toward the end of the year the architecture 
students seem to work around the clock-they come in 
early," says Lew. "Or on Saturdays if a sports team has to 
leave early or when there's an exam like the LSAT when 
everyone has to get up early, then I get a rush." On a nor-
mal day Lew serves about 350 customers, but when the din-
ing halls are closed at the beginning and end of the school 
year it is even busier. "It can get up as high as 500-550 cus-
tomers a day. There's only 12 stools, and we're only open 
eight hours. When you're serving 500 people you're push-
ing a lot of people." 

During his years at the Doodle, Lew has seen many 
restaurants come and go. He attributes the Doodle's staying 
power to a sort oflunch-
counter hoi y tri n i ry: 
"Good food, reasonable 
prices, and fast service." 
A fourth factor, the fam-
ily 
tradition, 
has 
undoubtedly contribut-
ed to the Doodle's suc-
cess. Unfortunately, the 
tradition will end with 
Lew. His son, a banker 
in Chicago, has no inter-
est in running a restau-
rant. Darlene is going to 
keep working at the 
Doodle as long as Lew 
keeps it open, but she 
doesn't covet Lew's 4:30 
to 3:30 daily schedule. 
"It's a lor of work, and I 
wouldn't be able to do 
it," she explains. 

As for Lew, he 
will head to Florida 
when he retires. "I plan 
to spend most of my time where it's nice and warm, where 
you don't have to worry about shoveling snow and starting 
the car when batteries won't start." But the move is still a 
few years off at least: "I'd like to hang on unril the year 2000 
because three things will happen," he says. " I' ll be 62, 
which is the retirement age; it'll be the year 2000, which is 
something; and the Doodle will be 50."
