EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
In April, Yale students can become
myopic. As seniors obsess over
essays, as juniors juggle seminar
papers, and as all students struggle
with exams, we have little time or
energy to face the outside world. By
putting the issue of family violence on
our cover, we hope to bring people out
of their weenie bins to consider the
realities of their community. We have
compiled the:.e women's stories to
make people think. Battering happens
to women everywhere-across the
lines of class, race, and education. It
happens to women at Yale.

Family violence is not the only
article in this issue that concentrates
on New Haven rather than Yale.
Whether we write about community
advocates or everyone's favorite neigh-
borhood diner,
Th~ N~w journal
reaches outÂ· to New Haven, hoping to
learn from and learn about its inner
workings.

From the Quinnipiac
Terrace Housing Project to Hillhouse
High School, the city offers vital
glimpses of life beyond the Ivory
Tower-all the more crucial in a place
like Yale, where we often lose sight of
everything but Sterling Memorial
Library.

The last weeks of school will slip
by before we know it, and we want to
take this opportunity to thank all the
seniors (and our one graduate student)
who have literally taught us everything
we know. Best of luck to Anna, Jenn,
Katherine, Joey, Masi, Sue, and
Dave--we know that you.r talents will
be appreciated wherever you go.

As for the rest of us, we have our
next issue to plan. We're holding a
meeting on Monday, April 13 at 7:30
in our office in the basement of
Calhoun under Entry F to discuss
TN]s summer issue. If you're interest-
ed in writing, photography, design,
layout, or selling ads, please attend or
call Kathy at 436-1441.
