Traditionally, American law has treated family vio-
lence as a private matter. Between eight and twelve 
million women in the U.S. will experience battering 
at some point in their lives, yet until recently police had lit-
de authority to intervene in domestic disputes. In the late 
70s, the New Haven Bartered Women's Project formed to 
support victims of abuse. Grassroots groups like this lob-


bied state legislatures ro bring legal protection into the 
home. 

In 1986, Connecricu t became one of rhe first states to 
make violence a crime. And whatever its shortcomings, the 
Family Violence Prevention and Response Act has forced 
police ro intervene between partners. "In rhe old days you 
didn't know what would happen if you called the police. As 
likely as nor, nothing," said psychologist Evan Stark, co-
director of the Domestic Violence Training Project in New 
Haven. "Now there is a predictable response." 

T he Family Violence 'Act instituted mandatory arrest 
for bacrerers. Whenever police believe that spousal assault 
has occured or will occur, they must arrest the abuser even if 
the victim asks them not co. Legislators created a family vio-
lence education program and hired victim advocates to steer 
battered women through che legal system. The law also pro-
vided protective and restraining orders for women who 
leave their partners and fear chat violence will recur. 

Some experts in the field charge that mandatory arrest 
discourages women from calling the police. But most of 
Connecticut's domestic violence workers applaud the thou-
sands of arrests char take place under the new law when 
none did before. ''I'm very happy with the law," said Stark. 
"For many men the arrest has a tremendous effect, and it 
empowers women." 

Barbara Glenn, one of Connecticut's four victim advo-
cates, serves as a liaison between abused women and the 
court system. She believes that prosecutors need to apply 
Connecticut's law more rigorously. After the arrest, the state 
usually drops charges unless it has the victim's cooperation. 
"By instituting mandatorv arrest, we took the burden off 
the victim," said Glenn. "But then we turn around and 
drop it back into her lap." 

In the event that prosecution takes place, barterers 
rarely go to prison. Most convicted men go on probation or 
pay fines. "Although the pattern of battering is predictable, 
most bacrerers are nor detained in prison, because society 
does not recognize them as dangerous," said Dr. Susan 
McLeer, vice-chair of psychiatry at the Medical College of 
Pennsylvania. "We simply fail to take battering seriously." 

Experts also link barterers' light penalties to popular 
misconcepdons about domestic violence. McLeer, who tes-
tifies in court on behalf of women who have killed their 
partners, has found that few judges and juries understand 
the complex nature o f family violence. "Many people 
believe that battered women Â· move from one abusive rela-
tionship to another, or that their provocadveness causes the 
battering," said McLeer. "But abused women are a heteroge-
neous population in every way. According to the data, there 


is no psychological portrait that many women neatly fit 
into. 

The Family Violence Act escapes the trap of blaming 
women for the violence. The law set up a state-funded fam-
ily violence education program for first-offense barterers. 
Men pay $100 for six weekly sessions. If both partners 
agree, the prosecution drops charges for men who complete 
the program. Yet statistics show that the program rarely 
changes behavior or prevents repeat offenses. "The program 
is the system's answer to rehabilitation, and as rehab the 
statistics show that it has limited success," said Glenn. She 
believes that the program proves more useful for the women 
than for their barterers. "If a man attends the program and 
beats his wife again, she can say that she gave him a chance 
to change, and it didn't work. With this behind them, some 
women can end abusive relationships." 

Many women trapped in the cycle of abuse take a long 
time to leave the relationship because they believe they can 
put an end to the violence. "Initially, the woman's goal is to 
minimize the violence and preserve the relationship," said 
McLeer. "But those are mutually incompatible goals." 

Many women call the police as a short-term solution to the 
escalation of violence rather than to see their husbands 
arrested. "Most women want the system to fix their hus-
bands, not to protect them," said Glenn. 

Women must see chat they are powerless to stop the 
violence before they can extricate themselves. "In order to 
make the decision to leave, a woman has to realize her own 
lack of control," said McLeer. Many have compelling rea-
sons to stay. Some depend on their husbands for financial 
support. Others fear the possible consequences of leaving, 
with good cause. Over 4000 women in the U.S. die annual-
ly as a result of domestic violence, and 58 percent of 
women raped over the age of 30 are attacked by abusive 
partners. 

Studies show that when a woman contemplates leaving, 
she finds herself in the greatest danger. "Getting out can be 
very difficult. Many men behave like Glenn Close's charac-
ter in Fatal Attraction in terms of relentless and targeted 
pursuit," said McLeer. 

Many women who decide to leave violent relationships 
do so because they don't want their children to become like 
their parents. Children from violent homes grow up sur-
rounded by role models based on the dominance of one 
parent rather than mutual respect. "Many kids can over-
come those kinds of gender expectations," said social work-
er Steven Nagler, clinical director of family support services 
at the Yale Child Study Center. "But why should they have 
to?" 

Once women bring themselves to leave the relation-


ship, they can ask the court for protective orders that make 


it illegal for their husbands to visit, telephone, or contact 
them in any way. Still, some men defy the orders. "The sys-
tem does not make women safe," said Glenn. "If an abuser 
is obsessive or doesn't respect the law, a piece of paper won't 
deter him." 

The law also fails to enforce protective orders with 
harsh penalties. Most men who break the orders can plea 
bargain their sentences to misdemeanors, the least serious 
category of criminal offense. Without reassurance that the 
violence will stop, some women hestitate to take action 
against their partners, knowing that a man who believes 
that his partner has gotten him inro trouble can become 
more dangerous. "Women are well aware that they don't 
have adequate protection, and that will affect the decisions 
they make," said McLeer. 

Experts want to make Connecticut's law tougher on 
barterers. Stark argues that men should go to jail for break-
ing protective orders, and that police should provide 
women with protection as soon as the judge issues an order, 
rather than waiting until they call for help. Stark also stress-
es that the legal system's failure to evaluate the history of 
violence and abuse in a relationship thwacts its own good 
intentions. "The real difficulty with the law is that it only 
reacts to the episode and doesn't take into account that bat-
tering is a historical crime," said Stark. 

Because of the complex and deeply personal nature of 
domestic violence, legal antidotes pose problems for both 
victims and law enforcement officials. When women con-
tinue to love the men who beat them, police throw up their 
hands in exasperation. "It makes the police crazy when 
women invite their husbands to come back," said Glenn. 
"When victims repeatedly fail to press charges or try to get 
protective orders overturned, they lose their credibility with 
the police and the courts. As a victim advocate, I try to 
make police understand why a woman might not make the 
decision they think she should." 

The six-year-old Family Violence Act has brought sup-
port service workers into the legal picture. Lawmakers' 
recognition that family violence is a crime that belongs in 
the public sphere has given victims and police a tool with 
which to counter abuse. Yet without vigilant enforcement, 
the promise of Connecticut's law remains only half-fulfilled.
