immediate plans to increase the num-
ber of female science faculty. "Yale is 
currently unwilling to recognize the 
lack of women as a significant flaw in 
its program," said Loper. "But if 40 
percent of students in an introductory 
physics class are women and the grad-
uating class includes only a handful, 
then there is a problem." 


Women faculty face obstacles 
even more daunting than 
those that frustrate their 
students. The struggle for tenure con-
tributes heavily to their tenuous posi-
tion at the university. In the first ten 
years of coeducation, the number of 
tenured women rose by only 18 while 
the number of men grew by 83. Only 
one woman received tenure in physics. 
"Yale is a university run by its senior 
faculty, and as long as women remain 
untenured it will always be male dom-
inated," said one woman professor. 


A few female professors allege that 
a glass ceiling in the sciences prevents 
them from getting ahead. "In my 
experience, the policy has never been 
to recruit women," said another 
female faculty member. "I have seen a 
pattern where women get hired as 
assistants or associate professors and 
then are never tenured." 


Charles Bockelman, the Director 
of Undergraduate Studies for Physics, 
disputes such charges. "It is not a 
question of not hiring women," 
claimed Bockelman, "When the posi-
tion comes up the best person for the 
job is hired." 


And other professors think that 
the position of women faculty will 
improve over time. Goldsmith claims 
that as more women fill the junior and 
associate positions, the number of 
tenured women inevitably will 
increase. Since Yale lacks a tenure 
track, however, a junior appointment 
is no guarantee of tenure. In fact, 
most junior professors must constantly 
apply for permanent positions at other 
schools while at Yale. 
APRIL IO, 1992 
While the university relies on nat-
ural progression of women up the job 
ladder to remedy its lack of female 
professors, the undergraduate admis-
sions office has adopted a more active 
policy. Todd Viola, who works part 
time in admissions as the science-engi-
neering coordinator, seeks out and 
identifies outstanding high school sci-
entists. He claims that his recruitment 
efforts apply especially to women and 
minorities. 


For incoming freshpeople, both 
male and female, the Dean's office 
sponsors the Academic Mentorship 
Program in Science. The new year-
long seminar program includes a 
weekly lecture by a professor explain-
ing his or her personal research, fol-
lowed by small discussion groups. But 
the lunchtime discussion group 
Women in Science, which Viola was to 
head, fizzled this year because of lack 
of student participation. 


With sparse institutional support, 
students have stepped in to fill the 
breach. Science at Yale has taken on a 
new dimension this year with the 
addition of an undergraduate support 
network for science majors. The 
Math-Science Sibling group, initiated 
last fall by Westley, Loper, and Nancy 
Cunningham OE '92), strives to foster 
communication between first-year and 
upper-level science students. But stu-
dent-run groups don't have the clout 
to effect real change. Female science 
students point out that only Yale can 
change the statistics by directly 
encouraging women to take science 
classes and by hiring more women 
professors. "People hold up groups like 
Women in Science as a solution to the 
problem," said Julia Charles (CC '92). 
"They say, 'What are you complaining 
about?' But that escapes the real prob-
lem: there are no women science pro-
fessors at Yale."
