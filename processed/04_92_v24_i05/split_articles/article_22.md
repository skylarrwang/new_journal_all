en the New Haven 
Project 
for 
Battered 
Women formed in 1977, it 
created a network of homes where vic-
tims could find shelter, a hodine, and 
a support group staffed by volunteers. 
A year later the project received funds 
from the Connecticut Department of 
Human Resources to establish a shel-
ter for women who wanted to leave 
their husbands but had nowhere to go. 
With the Family Violence Act of 
1986, the agency gained four victim 
advocates to help over 5000 victims 
negotiate the legal system. Now called 
Domestic Violence Services of Greater 
New Haven (DVS), the agency owns a 
shelter that houses 15 people for up to 
60 days each. 

Last year DVS responded to over 
850 crisis calls on its 24-hour hotline, 
housed over 200 women and children 
in the shelter and placed over 200 
more in motels. It also provided 
awareness training for police depart-
ments throughout the New Haven 
area, including the Yale 
Police. DVS also runs corn-
rnunity workshops to edu-
cate women about the pro-
tection that the law offers 
them. 

As a non-profit agency, 
DVS runs on a shoestring 
budget. Aside from state 
funds for the victim advo-
cates, the agency relies on 
grants from United Way and 
area towns as well as private 
donations. "We've had to 
fight every step of the way to 
get where we are now," said 
Margerita Ayala, who has 
worked at the New Haven 
shelter for 13 years. "Fifteen 
years ago there were no sup-
port services in this city. 
Now women who need help 
have people they can turn to 
and a safe place to stay." 

Counselors celebrate with 
the women who find the 
strength to leave their abusive hus-
bands and begin a new life. "I love to 
see the women who come here, whose 
husbands have controlled everything 
in their lives, show some indepen-
dence," said Ayala. 

Below, three local women tell their 
stories.
