takeover of Quinnipiac. "With Virginia, it's always, 'Yes, 
but .. .'" says former congressman Bruce Morrison. "You 
could say, 'Virginia, we just got $ 12 million for Quinnipiac 
Terrace,' and she'd say, 'Yes, I appreciate that, bur what 
about this, and what are you going to do about that?' That 
kind of energy and persistence makes her as successful as she 
... 
IS. 

Morrison and H enry allied in 1988 to prevent New 
York developer Aaron Gleich from buying Quinnipiac. 
Gleich promised to provide Quinnipiac with services like a 
job placement program. He also planned to renovate the 
facility with funds from the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development (HUD). Henry, however, worried 
about long term results. Tenants in public housing pay a 
fixed 30 percent of their income for rent. If Gleich had 
purchased Quinnipiac, he could have convened the water-
front property to market prices after 15 years, forcing out 
low-income tenants. 

Then Mayor Biagio DiLieto placed H enry and her 
daughter, Delzina, on a committee to assess Gleich's propos-
al, but both felt that the commission consistently ignored 
their input. They resigned from the committee at a press 
conference in the mayor's office, calling the decision-mak-
ing process a sham. 

When Alderman Frank Grasso (D-12) indicated that 
he would vote in favor of Gleich's 
faucets, walls that were coming apart," recalls Henry. She 
also pointed our the common hallways where drug dealers 
and abusers congregated. 

"The next thing we knew, HUD told us to give 
Quinnipiac Terrace whatever they needed to turn che place 
around," recalls David Echols, executive director of 
HANH. HUD granted Quinnipiac $12.4 million. Half of 
these funds went to remodel kitchens and bathrooms, 
remove asbestos and lead-based paint, and eliminate the 
common hallways. Quinnipiac plans to use the remaining 
money to improve the facilicy's grounds. 

H
enry moved to Quinnipiac Terrace in search of a 
safe place to raise her family. She placed her name 
on a waiting list in 1965 and finally got in nine 
years later, when the development abandoned a policy for-
bidding access to unwed mothers. "It had everything," 
recalls Henry, who has never married. "Grass, trees, a park, 
nice acmosphere ... it was a nice place to live and raise a fami-

Unfortunately, the same park that attracted Henry also 
appealed to drug dealers. Not only did the park afford an 
unobstructed view of oncoming police cars, bur the devel-
opment's easy access co the highways made it perfect for a 
quick getaway. By the mid-80's, extensive drug traffic had

ers picketed his home. Grasso 
thought that the social services Gleich 
proposed could help Quinnipiac, bur 
he voted against the takeover in 
response to tenants' fears about rent 
stability. The Gleich deal didn't go

shooting target. "Even now, we can't

used to," she says. "You never know

Even before Gleich appeared on the scene, the Housing 
Authority of New Haven (HANH) had plans to renovate 
Quinnipiac. Unfortunately, other sites ranked high~r on 
their list of priorities. Henry went to work and convmced 
HUD that Quinnipiac's problems could not wait. 

With strong support from Morrison, Henry and her tenants 
persuaded HUD representatives to visit Quinnipiac. "We
