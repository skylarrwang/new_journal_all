Jumping Thursdays at Bahama 
Bob's could last forever. 


Decades after disco's 
hundreds of America's Funniest Home Videos and dreamed 
of getting their own public access cable shows, just like 
Wayne and Garth of \%yms World. 
But unfortunately, we can't all have our 15 minutes of 
fame right away. For local exhibitionists who haven't yet hit 
the airwaves, the new karaoke singing and "challenge" bars 
have become the adrenaline oudet of choice, and New 
Haven is their newest mecca. Come the weekend, Yalies 
and townies alike flock to the clubs just to make complete 
fools of themselves. 


In the early hours of the evening, as sane people finish 
their happy hour buffets, dedicated jumpers arrive at 
Bahama Bob's to assure their places in line and check out 
the terrain. Already, the Velcro pit crew has marked off the 
field with "CAUTION!" tape and has started handing out 
"consent" forms to sign. No one needs to tell these adven-
turers that they will be courting injury or death. The forms 
warn them of a more gruesome fate: their names and pho-
tos may someday be used in sponsors' promotions. If you 
can't overcome the fear of publicity, you clearly don't belong 
in the game. Besides, the rewards make jumping worth-
while-cash prizes for the best jumps, complementary cas-
setces, and waitresses spraying alcohol into the crowd from 
pump bottles. All because, as an emcee reminds us, we're at

whece 
"YOU 
can 
stick. .. YOURself...TO A WALL!!!" 


But first comes another daunting challenge-that of 
keeping amused for the hour before the jumping starts. 
When the thrill of sitting around, drinking, and watching 
TV wears off. the surrounding neighborhood offers ample 
opportunity for fun. Right down the block, you can find a 
musical playground at Play It Again 
Sam. Sam's, a piano bar with a mis-
sion, offers its guests the chance to 
grab the spotlight without even 
putting down their drinks. On a 
raised p latform in the center of the 
room stands the central attraction: the 
dueling (or dual-ing, as it is mispelled 
on the bar's marquee) pianos. At two 
facing baby grands sit two Sams, ready 
to play it again, or play it a third time, 
or play any tune that's catchy. They 
perform tag-team style: as Sam One 
bangs out the song on his piano, Sam 
Two pounds a rhythm on his, while 
shaking a tambourine with aerobic 
intensity. Switching back and forth, 
they provide high-octane, if not virtu-
osic, renditions of "Day-0," "All 
Shook Up," and other party-starters. 
And, wouldn't you know it, they seem 
to have memorized every Billy Joel hit 
ever written. 


B 
ut these Piano Men aren't con-
tent to just sing. They want us 
to sing right back at them-not 
meekly, but like we mean it. From the 
club's walls not-so-subliminal messages 
scream, "Clap my hands and shout ... 
Kick up my heels and SHOUT!" and 
the Sams have 
apparently 
sworn 
to 
uphold 
house rules if it 
kills 
them.

"All in all it's

WHAT?-
Another Brick 
in the Wall!" 
scream 
both 
Sams in uni-
son, evoking Ethel Merman far more 
than Pink Floyd. Next they try dirty 
versio~s of Beatles songs, hoping we'll 
chime in on the naughty words. 
"Desmond takes a trolley to the jewel-
er's store," adlibs a Sam, "Buys a pack 
of condoms for a buck/ Takes it back 
to Molly waiting at the door/ And as 
he gives it to her they begiJl to ... 
To ... ?" Silence. 


Later, in the middle of the Village 
People's "In the Navy," some frat guys 
finally deign to scream back a c~orus. 
The Sams, visibly pleased, seize the 
moment to segue into an upbeat Billy 
Joel standby. Unfortunately, almost 
no one else.picks up on this burst of 
enthusiasm. After turning around to 
see who the show-offs are, the other 
patrons go back to stirring their drinks 
and humming. By this point, Sam 
One has had about all he can take. 
Wondering aloud whether we're all 
just sissies or something, he launches 
into a classic called "There's a Skeeter 
On My Peter, Wackin' Off." More 
silence.. "Maybe you don't care," Sam 
sniffs, "but I do!" 


Back at Bob's, the crowd has 
swelled and anticipation is building. 
The emcee, however, appears to be 
having a crisis. After bantering on 
about the joys of Velcro for over an 
hour, he's running out of things co say. 
As the contestants suit up and fling 
themselves at the surface, all he can do 
is fixate inanely on their names: "This

versions of Beatles songs, 
hoping we'll chime in on 
the naughty words. 
is Quick Vic. Will Quick Vic stick? 
Quick Vic stick? Q uick Vic W ILL 
stick!" Maybe he's gone into an infi-
nite loop-if so, no one is paying 
attention. Not only that, but after a 
few minutes, no one watches the 
jumping anymore, either. As at Sam's, 
the anticlimax is heartbreaking. That 
person spread-eagled up there on the 
wall probably waited all week for this, 
the most embarrassing moment of his 
life so far. And now, he might as well 
be the "Where's Waldo" guy, for all the 
attention he's getting. What's the deal 
here, anyway? 


Maybe, like with TV 
car crashes, prolonged exposure to odd 
public behavior desensitizes us to it. 
Or maybe "challenge" bar-hopping is 
like any supervised play period-when 
it's not your turn on the swings or the 
slide, it's just another long line to 
stand in.
