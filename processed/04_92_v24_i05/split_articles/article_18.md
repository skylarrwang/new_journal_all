Suzy Loper {SY '92), the lone fomal.e 
physics major in her class, helped create 
the Math-Science sibling group. 

C C s 
tudies show that women, by 
the undergraduate years, 
rend to shy aw7ty from 
math-related sciences," said biology 
professor Mary Helen Goldsmith. 

Girls learn early that to pursue a career 
in math or science goes against the 
grain of societal expectations, and 
··tany colleges give them little reason 
:- ~ believe otherwise. Yale proves no 
.: .~ception to the rule. With few 
women faculty to serve as role models, 
Yale may indeed compound the attri-
tion rare. 

-Most Group IV departments suf-
fer from a severe drop-off in the num-
ber of women who continue past 
introductory-level courses. Students 
estimate the female-to-male ratio in 
upper-level electrical engineering 
courses at one in four, and the physics 
ratio at a startling one in ten. A huge 
gap between the number of men and 
women science majors plagued last 
year's graduating class. In the most 
glaring example, the physics depart-
ment had no women graduates in 
1991 and will give a degree to only 
one woman this year. 

Suzy Loper (SY '92), the lone 
female physics major in the senior 
class, believes that the lack of women 
faculty lies at the root of the low num-
ber of female science students. In 
physics, applied physics, biology, engi-
neering, math, and MB&B, only 6 our 
of 139 tenured professors are women. 

Marian Westley (SM '93), one of four 
female physics majors in her class, has 
never had a female professor because 
there are none in her department. 

Only biology stands out among 
the science departments for its abun-
dance of women students; it in fact 
boasts more women students than 
men. Still, the ratio does not result 
from any special effort on the part of 
the university. Instead, biology attracts 
women because it is the stepping stone 
to medical school. "People who are 
more concerned about the practical 
application of their education choose 
biology," explained Loper. And some 
women may choose biology because it · 
requires less math than other sciences. 
"Biology is traditionally more attrac-
tive because it doesn't have as much 
reliance on quantitative calculations," 
said Goldsmith. Biology also has three 
women professors, making it the most 
integrated science department at Yale. 

Female students in the "hard" sci-
ences, such as physics, engineering, 
and math, say that the paucity of 
female role models on the faculty 
alienates them from the sciences. 
"When everyone you go to for help is 
of the opposite sex, there is a strange 
dynamic created," said engineering 
major Ida Primus (BR '93). Male pro-
fessors simply cannot fill the void. "It's 
not so much a matter of male faculty 
not supporting you, but of having the 
chance to see people like you who are 
farther along," explained Westley. 

Students like Primus seek summer 
programs geared towards women, such 
as Mills College Summer Math 
Institute, to study under female pro-
fessors. 

Yale women who must look to 
other schools to obtain the support 
they need call for a change in the uni-
versity's agenda. In 1989, a committee 
headed by psychology professor Judith 
Rodin submitted a report which called 
for recruitment of female and minority 
professors, but the university has no
