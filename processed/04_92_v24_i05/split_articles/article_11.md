the old books and manuscripts, and
798 screened bulbs illuminate the
books within the cower.
A harem bathing chamber in
Istanbul inspired the design of the
Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript
Library. Gordon Bunshaft, the build-
ing's architect, constructed the original
miniature model of the library with
side panels of Peruvian onyx in an
attempt to reproduce the chamber's
tan glow.
A collection that now consists of
500,000 volumes and several million
manuscripts traces its origins to a back
shelf that English literature Professor
Chauncey Brewster Tinker, known as
the first "Keeper of Rare Books",
began in the main library, housed at
the time in Dwight Hall. In 1930, the
university transferred the collection to
the Rare Book Room of the new
Sterling Memorial Library. Officials
requested a separate building in 1958
wh'en the collection expanded beyond
capacity. A donation of several mil-
lion dollars from the Beinecke family
enabled Yale to make plans for a new
facility.
Bunshaft continued to draw on
foreign models for the exterior of the
building, this time from France. To
complement the Neo-Classical and
Gothic
buildings that surround
Beinecke, he stylized the building's
surface to match those of Commons
and Woolsey Hall and copied a box-
like structure from a Gothic library in
Rouen to harmonize it with the Law
School and Berkeley College.
Mixed reactions greeted the final
result. "There is no excuse for putting
this brute of modern design in the
midst of gracious and beautiful build-
ings," fumed one architect and Yale
alumnus in a letter to then Yale
President A. Whitney Griswold. At
the same time, an article from The
Times of London proclaimed, "The
whole spatial conception is one of
remarkable simplicity, which the
severely classical exterior expresses."
The number of opinions around
the building's design matches the
many legends that have sprung up
around Beinecke. One popular tale
concerns the fire-extinguishing system
that seals off sections of the library and
pumps in gas co smother the flames.
Officials stopped using carbon dioxide
after employees voiced safety concerns.
"There were red signs saying clear the
area within one minute," explained
Christa Sammons, Beinecke Library's
Public Relations Officer. "Carbon
dioxide makes the voice drop an
octave and causes headaches but is not
incompatible with life." The system
now uses halon, a safer gas.
The library's underground level,
divided into sections like a submarine
for further fire protection, houses
bookstacks for an additional 600,000
volumes. Offices and a reading room
surround a sunken courtyard that
Bunshaft modeled after the medieval
cloister scriptorium. He filled the
space with sculpture instead of plant-
ing to reduce the danger of water seep-
age into the books below.
Bunshaft chose Isamu Noguchi as
the sculptor. As buildings in the
Middle East and Europe inspired the
architect, South Asian structures pro-
vided a model for the sculptor.
Noguchi carved Imperial Danby mar-
ble into shapes reminiscent of huge
astronomical viewing instruments he
had seen in Jaipur, India. He created a
sphere to represent the sun or cosmic
energy, a pyramid to symbolize the
geometry of the earth or of the past,
and a cube to signify chance.
Bunshaft once wrote that he want-
ed to dramatize the rare book collec-
tion's importance in a building that
stands in the heart of the Yale campus.
Even Beinecke's detractors must admit
that he fulfilled that goal. The library's
striking
design
provoked
Yale
Corporation member Wilmarth S.
Lewis to declare in his dedication
address in 1963, "Nobody at Yale can
be unaware of the Beinecke Library,
and it will be a very incurious scholar
who will not venture inside it at least
once.
