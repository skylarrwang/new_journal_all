mean that we skip the run because 
we're too wrapped up in a book or 
arguing with a friend, or we're just too 
tired to haul our bum off the couch 
today. Or we may decide that, even 
though it's not a long-term cure for 
our woes, it reaJly would make us feel 
better to drown our sorrows in ice 
cream for a nigltt or two. 

I 
remember the night last May 
when my mother suggested I ask 
my internist to check out my 
metabolism. "After all," she said, 
"you've gained a lot of weight since 
you started school, but you don't eat 
an enormous amount." I lashed back 
at her with the usual get-off-my-
back, when-I-wanc-your-advice-1'11-
ask-for-it rhetoric, and threw in 
some feminist love-your-body theory 
for good measure. Her words stung, 
though. Only now do I see that she 
was right-not in her negative judg-
ment about my looks, but in saying 
that I really don't eat "an enormous 
amount" at school. I eat pretty 
much what I want: more during 
exams, less when I'm stressed out 
about a project or personal crisis. I 
also go to the gym three times a 
week, and would rather have a vege-
tarian entree than fried foods any 
day. But the truth is that, while I'm 
hardly obese, I have been too 
wrapped up in the rest of my life to 
deal with the "project" of disciplin-
ing my body, even if I'd wanted to. A 
wonderful concept, when you think 
about it. 

A lot of women I know have 
gained weight in college. But we've 
also gained a lot more-in self-
respect, independence, first loves, 
broken hearts, political beliefs, 
debating slcills, confidence, and expe-
rience. Isn't that something to cele-
brate?
