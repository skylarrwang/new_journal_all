or a week-long series called "Popular Culture: Inside 
Hollywood," teenage hosts interview the producers of 
Final Analysis and Waynt"s World about the movie 
business. The 12-minute broadcast closes with advertise-
ments for Ooritos and Pop-Tarrs, and then flashes back co a 
"Facing the Future" question for its viewers: "Is it okay for 
mothers of high school students to have full-rime jobs?" 
T he program appears not on MTV, but on Channel 
One, an educational nerwork that broadcasts to over 9000 
high schools across the country, including New Haven's 
Hillhouse High School. At Hillhouse, the show airs at 7:50 
a.m. and receives little more than a glance from students 
who trickle into class early. Those who have been half-lis-
tening laugh at the notion that mothers of high school stu-
dents don't work. At an inner cicy school like Hillhouse, the 
question has little relevance. 

When Superintendent of Schools John Dow, Jr. first 
introduced Channel One to Hillhouse hsr spring, it sparked 
a great deal of controversy among teachers. Some objected to 
the advertisements, while ochers argued over when to air the 
program so that it would not disrupt the school day. 

Hillhouse Principal Lonnie Garris, Jr. counts himself 
among Channel One's fans. He believes that the benefits of 
the program outweigh irs shortcomings. "Channel One

provides far- reaching opportunities," he said. "We have 
only begun to realize its potentiaL" His enthusiasm seems in 
part from the recognition that by broadcasting Channel 
One, his resource-starved school can get extra funding and 
equipment. In exchange for the permission co broadcast irs 
programs on a daily basis, the Whircle Educational Nerwork 
gives schools televisions, videocassette recorders, and satel-
lite dishes. Teachers and administrators can take advantage 
of the television monitors to broadcast announcements and 
videos. "Channel One's beauty is the way in which the 
school can use the equipment," said Hillhouse English 
teacher Sandra Friday. 

But other teachers express skepticism about the use of 
TV in education. Chemistry teacher Lise Orville chose 
not co allow a Channel One monitor in her homeroom 
because she feels chat commercial television has no place 
in the school. "I chink students watch too much television, 
period," Orville said. "I find it distracting." 

Even reachers who like the program don't believe chat 
ads belong in a school setting. "Although I suppon Channel 
One, I don't like the ads," admitted social studies reacher 
Dr. Burt Saxon. "Getting Channel One for free with ads is a 
Faustian bargain." 

Whittle representatives point our char ads, which 
appear for two out of twelve minutes of each broadcast, 
make the news program possible. "When the Berlin Wall 
fell, we were there. When Nelson Mandela was released 
from prison in South Africa, we were there," said Hicks 
Neal, an ancho r correspondent for Channel One. "To 
fi nance these lcinds of trips, we need a lor of money." To 
Neal, the benefits of international news coverage offset che 
negative implications of advertising in schools. 

By presenting news in a format that appeals co high 
schools students, Channel One hopes to catch the attention 
of its audience long enough co get across crucial bites of 
informacion. And with global coverage, the nerwork claims 
that it can prepare American students for an increasingly 
interconnected world. "We're helping to make the world a 
litcle bit smaller," said Neal. 

To calm the initial storm that erupted over its decision 
to air Channel One during the school day, the Hillhouse 
administration chose to air the program before homeroom. 
Many administrators regard homeroom as the ideal rime co

watch C hannel One, but teachers need that time to take 
in exchange for much-needed funds, the business sector will

expect to dictate the direction of American education in the 
address system. Broadcasting the program later in the day 
future. "I fear the result of corporate intervention will be 
would disrupt classes. As a result of the early-bird time slot, 
schools that just produce workers," said Saxon. 

Experts like MacMullen question the motives behind 
the business community's newfound interest.in public 
schools. "If the business community is interested in public 
education only because it chinks of students as products and 
their educational needs in terms of economic competition, 
then we have reason to worry," she warned. 

The actual impact of Channel One on Hillhouse stu-
dents does not seem to live up to detractors' fears. Because 
most students hang out in the hallways instead of flocking 
to the TV monitors, few watch the program enough for it 
to exert much influence upon them. 

But supporters' hopes for the network fall short as well. 
The students interviewed who watch Channel One do not 
pay more attention to the show's content because of its slick 
format. As a result, any exposure to current events that stu-
dents gain from the broadcast is minimal. English teacher 
Friday, who has a television in her homeroom, does not 
think that Channel One has caught on with most students. 
"My impression is that some of the students watch it, but 
not eagerly," she said. 

Although students on the whole greet Channel One 
with indifference, when they do comment on the program 
they mention its format-not the news inside the package. 
While the program's stated purpose of educating students 
is virtually unnoticed, its hosts 
and ads successfully appeal to 
their audience. One student, 
who says he watches Channel 
One occasionally, does not 
think the program helps him 
find out more about world 
events. "It's okay," he said with 
a shrug. "I like the kids that 
do the show. And I like the 


Some teachers approve of Channel One because it tries 
to keep students informed about current events. Many of 
the students at Hillhouse come from families that do not 
encourage kids to read the newspaper or watch television 
news programs. Teachers appreciate Channel One's attempt 
to address this deficiency. "The news is current and makes 
students aware of what's happening around the world," said 
history teacher Mark Gould, the Hillhouse coordinator of 
Channel One. "It's geared to their level." 

Those who object to Channel One, however, criticize 
the program for talking down to students. With its teenage 
hosts, simplified language, and ads that target adolescents, 
Channel One reflects America's lowered expectations of its 
students. "The format of Channel One is the kind of for-
mat that dominates the media already. Everything is given 
to students in short snippets," said Edith MacMullen, direc-
tor of the Teacher Preparation program at Yale. "I think it's 
demeaning to kids that we nee;d~to~~~~~m~ak~e~si~m~p~le~· ...... ...:a::b:o~u~t~im:.:.!:::::.::.:~.:.:.:.::::::..!~
and lower the standards for 
them to learn. We should be 
challenging them instead. 
Complexity is not limited to 
a few people at Yale." 

Educators' concern over 
Channel One's introduction 
of corporate advertising into 
schools reflects a deeper fear. 
As the Federal government 
withdraws support from 
public education, big busi-
ness is picking up some of 
the tab. Educators worry that
