"The Hill Health Center is not an
umbrella for other organizations, but
rather an octopus," said Alderwoman
Toni Harp (0-2). The center, located
just beyond the Yale Medical School,
extends its tentacles into New Haven's
social fabric to address a variety of the
Elm City's special needs.

In 1968, a group of Yale Med stu-
dents founded the clinic on a
shoestring budget to care for people in
the Hill, one of the most economically
troubled areas of New Haven. Today,
the Hill Health Center (HHC) serves
120,000 patients a year with a staff of
200 and has branches in Dixwell and
at the Jackie Robinson Middle School.

HHC's bilingual staff supplies a
wide variety of basic medical services
to the community, from treating chil-
dren's cavities co delivering babies.
The clinic provides free medical care
for welfare recipients and a sliding rate
scale for other patients. Federal, state,
and local governments cover two-
thirds of expenses, and patient fees
make up the balance.

The center has launched efforts to
mitigate acute New Haven problems
like under-employment, AIDS, home-
lessness, and drug abuse. HHC also
runs the Senior AIDES Program,
which places elderly New Haven resi-
dents in jobs at non-profit organiza-
tions. "Senior citizens supplement
their often restricted incomes," said
Harp. "They also feel useful con-
tributing to the community."

To combat the growing problem
of teenage pregnancy in New Haven,
the clinic sponsors the Young Parents'
Outreach Program that provides spe-
cial care for pregnant teens and enables
them to stay in school. The Healthy
Start Program oversees pre-natal ser-
vices, while the Hispanic Mothers
Outreach offers bilingual counseling
for entire families. HHC provides
pregnancy testing and assigns social
workers to pregnant women. Even if
these women do not return to the cen-
ter, the social workers makes sure chat
they continue to receive care.

HHC doctors do not perform
abortions, although the center pro-
vides pregnancy counseling. In viola-
cion of the gag rule, counselors still
discuss all options with patients.
"Despite the government's intentions,
the rule has not changed our actual
operation," said Harp.

AIDS poses another challenge for
the center. "It's alarming to see how
HIV has entered 'new' populations
like women and especially teenagers in
the past year," said Steven Ingram, the
Director of AIDS Outreach at HHC.
Ingram's AIDS program focuses spe-
cial attention on New Haven youth,
striving to change high-risk behavior.
"I honestly believe chat most young
people are aware of how AIDS is
spread," said Ingram. "But even if they
don't use drugs, many still have unpro-
tected sex." Aside from its health edu-
cation programs, HHC provides med-
ical care and support for 500 AIDS
patients in New Haven.

"In New Haven, crises com-
pound," said Alderwoman Escher
Armand (D-7). "Substance abuse has
always been a significant problem. But
coupled with the loss of jobs, drug and
alcohol addiction has been on the
rise." Addressing chis increase, HHC
plans to open a 25-bed detoxification
center on Cedar Street later chis
spring. "We hope to provide accessibil-
ity to detox for all people, regardless of
their ability to pay," explained
Armand. "We need to take the pres-
sure off the emergency room."

HHC plans to continue providing
vital medical; psychological, and social
services to the New Haven communi-
ty. Imminent cuts in Connecticut's
General Assistance and Aid to Families
with Dependent Children programs,
however, will further burden the cen-
ter. "Without these subsidies, people
will not be able to afford the basic
necessities essential co maintaining
good health." explained Harp. "The
threatened cuts won't make our mis-
sion any easier, but we'll survive."
