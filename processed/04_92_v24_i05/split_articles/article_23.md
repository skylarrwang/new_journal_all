EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
showed me his computerized record, 
as long as your arm. I found out that 
Mark was what they call a career criminal-
rapes, assaults, drugs, anything 
that you can do against the law. He 
had done six years in the state prison 
for _rape. I decided to divorce him. 
When I told him he came home and 
beat the living crap out of me. He 
threw me around my house, punched 
me like I was a ragdoll. 

Afterwards Mark begged me to 
forgive him. I put the divorce on hold 
because I wanted to give him one 
more chance to prove to himself that 
he could be a better person. You hear 
stories about people who have had a 
rough life and turn themselves around. 
Finally I couldn't take it any more 
and started to divorce him again. I 
knew that the relationship was a dead 
end. I put my children right up in 
front of me. I couldn't put them 
through that kind of life. Many times 
they saw me getting beaten, the blood. 
I don't want them to think it's okay to 
hit people. 

In June, when my divorce was in 
progress Mark and I went on a date 
and decided to get back together. 
Between last summer and November 
he beat me up five or six times. I covered 
up the bruises with make up, but 
who was I trying to fool? In 
November, I told him: "You don't 
want to change," and he packed up 
and left. 

He's gotten arrested a bunch of 
times for breaking the restraining 
orders. Once he punched a hole in my 
front door trying to get in. Now I have 
two protective orders and a restraining 
order but he's persistent: phone calls, 
letters, sending people to talk to me. 
Last New Year's Eve, after we had 
been divorced for two months, the 
children and I agreed to let Mark take 
us out to dinner. While we ate he kept 
telling them that he was moving back 
in. He came home with us, and after 
the kids went to bed I told him that he 
couldn't stay, which triggered an explosion. He said: "I'm not leaving, I'll kill 
you before this is over." He accused me 
of seeing other men and spit at me. He 
banged my head against the wall and 
strangled me and hit me over and over 
again. I kept screaming "I didn't do 
anything! Get out!" but he wouldn't let 
me near the phone. 

It was late and I was so afraid. He 
forced me to give him oral sex, said if I 
didn't he'd kill me. I was crying so 
hard. So many times I said please 
respect my wishes, but he forced me to 
have sex. He called me so many awful 
names. 

He stayed for two days. I didn't 
know what to do. I was beside myself 
on New Year's Day, afraid to provoke 
him, afraid to get help. So I went 
along with him. I thought maybe he'd 
mellow out and go. 

I was sorer than sore, a wreck. I 
was afraid to pick up the phone, afraid 
of what he'd do to my kids. The next 
morning he pushed me into the 
kitchen, slammed me against the 
fridge, beat me again. My kids were 
getting ready for school and they witnessed all of it. After they left he stayed 
for hours. I was so afraid he'd kill me. 
That night the kids and I went to 
the police department, and the cop 
was so cold. He didn't even take me 
into a private room to hear my story. 
He asked me why I had waited to 
report what Mark had done, and then 
he told me that I didn't have a leg to 
stand on in court. I was crying, the 
kids were too. We walked out and I 
felt stripped, devastated. Why didn't 
they help me? I was afraid to go home. 

A week later I went back and the 
police captain tried to cover up for 
that cop. He took a report, and now 
Mark is facing a sexual assault charge. 
He could get 20 years, but he's out on 
bail. Three weeks ago he started to 
contact me, and I reported it. 

Last month I called Domestic 
Violence Services. They offered 
babysitting, so I came to the support 
group. I walked in and saw wall-to-
wall women. I kept thinking I'm not 
the only one, I'm not alone. The 
group helped and reassured me almost 
immediately. 

How many women never say anything 
because they're scared to death? 
You wonder why they don't turn 
around? Because they're afraid they'll 
get killed. If I had stayed longer in that 
relationship I could have been dead. 

Now I have to learn what I want 
out of my life, what I need, to understand what a healthy relationship is. 
I'm not ready for other men. I have 
too much fear. 

Dani left her husband after five months 
of marriage because she found 
his violent behavior unacceptable. The 
32-year-old woman and her child have 
left the New Haven Shelter to start over. 


My second husband was 
always a little crazy, but as 
long as he didn't bother me 
it was fine. Before we were married I 
knew that he fought with other men 
when he was angry. He takes medication 
because he can't control his anger, 
and he's a recovering alcoholic. A 
counselor told me drinking doesn't 
make a difference in terms of violent 
behavior, but I don't believe that. 

The relationship was stupid. We 
met in May, got married in September, 
and I left in January. I got sick and 
tired of him, his drinking, the violence. 
He would get angry at things I said and 
choke me. I always fought back. 
I never called the cops-I 
wouldn't cause trouble for him like 
that. Also, my husband always 
snatched the phone out of the wall or 
hid the receiver when we fought. 

The first night I felt unsafe, I 
called the shelter and left. I can't live 
with a person I'm scared of, and I 
couldn't take the verbal abuse towards 
me and my son. I couldn't have my 
son grow up like that. My father 
always put me down and it was hell. 

I left because I know what's right 
and wrong and I didn't have time for 
that nonsense. A lot of women are 
afraid to be alone because they have 
low self-esteem. I don't need a man to 
feel whole because I don't feel unwhole. Next September, I want to go 
back to school. 

Maria sought shelter for herself and 
her five children after she decided to end 
a nine-year relationship with her 
boyfriend, a drug addict who abused her 
mentally and threatened her life. In her 
early 30s, she has lived at the New 
Haven Shelter for Battered Women for 
over a month. 

I'm like the black sheep of my family 
because I went to jail for delivering 
drugs. My family was always 
putting me down. I stay away from my 
mother. She loved my first husband. 
He acted totally different when we 
went to visit her. When I told my 
mother that I left him because he beat 
me she called me a liar. They tell you 
to put the past behind you but somehow it 
always sneaks up. 

My first husband was a physical 
abuser. He acted like my father, sat at 
the table with me with a belt to make 
sure I'd eat. If you tell a man, "you're 
not my father, don't tell me what to 
do," he'll hit you twice as hard. You 
can't fight back against a man bigger 
than you-you'll just get hurt. 

I was 17 when I got married, and 
four years later I left, running for my 
life. My husband beat me until I 
passed out if I left the house without 
him or got a phone call he didn't like. I 
thought I was doing something wrong. 

When we were still on our honey-
moon I cooked him breakfast. He 
asked for his eggs sunnyside up, and I 
broke the yolk, so he punched me in 
the face. That first time I figured okay, 
so I did the eggs wrong, and he's late 
for work. He was a real sweet man 
before we were married, and the violence came like a shock.

I was young and I knew nothing, 
not about birth control, or nothing. I 
got pregnant real quick and I delivered 
at 6 months because my husband kicked 
me in the stomach. My 
first son, he died because the kick 
crushed his skull. My husband had 
the nerve to blame me. 

I had no friends. He didn't want 
anyone in the house and he wouldn't 
let me use the phone. I was so scared I 
wouldn't go outside, even when he was 
at work. I had a collection of sunglasses 
to hide the black eyes. 

Sometimes the neighbors would 
call the cops and they'd come and see 
me with a busted lip or bruises and 
they wouldn't arrest him because they 
didn't see what happened. They'd say, 
go cool off, wait 'til she cools off, then 
come back. Once after they left he hit 
me with a machete. 

But what goes around comes 
around, cause now he's seven feet 
under the ground. He got AIDS and 
when he was in the hospital they came 
looking for me because I was still his 
legal wife. They wanted me to sign the 
papers to turn off the life-support 
machines. His life was in my hands. I 
know it's wrong, but with all the 
abuse, I thought now I had my chance 
to get back at him. And 
you know what? I didn't 
have the heart. I told them 
to wait until his heart 
stopped beating. 

My boyfriend, John, 
didn't hit, but he used lan-
guage that made me feel so 
bad that I would rather get 
hit and get it over with. 

For the first five years 
he was fine. We did every-
thing together and we 
never fought. Then the 
drugs started, and that was 
it. He got into cocaine and 
drinking. It got so bad that 
everything started to disappear from my house. I'd 
send him with $450 to pay 
the rent and the owner 
would get maybe $300 of 
it. I left him a few times, 
but he'd come with a story 
that he would change, get 
a job, stop the coke. I'm 
real softhearted, and when 
I heard his sad story about how much 
he missed the kids, how he wanted 
another chance, I'd come back. For a 
couple of weeks or months it would be 
different, but never for long. 

One day, I decided, this is it. The 
kids had started to hate me. I thought, 
I put my kids first or I go through hell 
for the rest of my life. I stayed for so 
long because I was afraid to be by 
myself. But I realized, this is a waste. 
I'm doing it by myself now, why can't I 
do it alone out there? I realized: I'm a 
smart person, I don't need him thinking 
for me. My kids helped me with 
the decision. We did it together.
