Editor's Note 
We have watched the sun rise for three days in a row now, and we're 
slightly behind schedule on our first production weekend as a new staff. 


As we scramble to write headlines, develop photos and lay down copy, 
we stop to remember our friend Chris Warfield, who would have been a 
member of our staff. 


Last winter break, after two months in the hospital, Chris died from 
complications of lupus, an immuno-deficiency disease. When we 
returned to campus to tackle our first issue of the semester, we hoped she 
might be back to work with us. During reading period, we had visited 
her in the infirmary at University Health Services, where she talked 
about plans for The New Journal. 


Chris never stopped asking about the magazine. Sometimes we felt 
awkward sitting on the orange vinyl couch in her room at UHS, but 
Chris always tried to make us feel comfortable. She laughed at our 
stories of production crises and offered us chocolate chip cookies that the 
doctors wouldn't let her eat herself. 


Chris started coming to writers' meetings at the crarrtped TNJ office 
on Crown Street in the fall of 1988. We had all just joined the magazine 
and were eargerly throwing .out ideas for stories. Chris thoughtfully 
listened to the other writers and began to generate some ideas of her 
own. Her first story, about a School of Music program for gifted high 
school graduates, appeared in the April 21, 1989 issue of TNJ. 


In March 1989, Chris was elected circulation manager. When she 
took on the job, Chris really threw herself into it. She drew up route 
lists, called people the night before each issue came out, and got to know 
almost everyone on the staff. Barreling around campus behind the wheel 
of a bulky U-Haul truck, Chris distributed 11,000 copies of TNJ. 


Sometimes she ran red lights or double parked, blasting the radio and 
cracking jokes as she drove. Chris said she purposely chose the position 
of circulation manager because it involved physical work and she wanted 
to challenge herself. Even when it rained during circulation, as it 
invariably did, she never complained. 


Chris couldn't run circulation from the hospital, but she continued to 
think about the magazine. When we visited her at UHS during her last 
weeks there, she bubbled over with ideas for TN]s future. "We'll make 
T-shirts, organize parties and really boost spirit," she said. "I want to 
make the magazine better!" 


We hope to carry on The New .Journal as Chris would have wanted. We 
will miss her. 


As Commencement approaches, The New Journal wishes to acknowledge 
the important contributions made to the magazine by members of the 
Class of 1990. We extend our thanks to Ethan Cohen, Ruth Conniff, 
David Greenberg, Stephen Hooper, John Kim and Jamie Workman for 
all their hard work, talent and enthusiasm. Their dedication has shaped 
The New Journal. We are grateful for the time and energy that they 
devoted to the magazine, and we wish them the best of luck in their 
future endeavors.

**A Mediation Program at Yale**
**Author: Alison Buttenheim**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
yet administrative assistants in eight out of 
12 colleges had never heard of it.. June 
Ellen Sullivan in Timothy Dwight 
College and Alicia Baker in Trumball 
College both remembered the flyers 
but couldn't find them. "I threw them 
out months ago," said Sullivan. "No 
one ever took them." 

Zimmerman, Professor McCarthy 
and Malinowski remain optimistic that 
the program will catch on in time. 
Malinowski, who commits forty hours 
per week to other extracurricular 
activities, hopes that writing letters to 
freshmen counselors and to College 
Masters this summer will help promote 
the program. "I'm sick of the admini-
strative bullshit. I just want to do 
mediations." McCarthy thinks Yalies are 
too accustomed to ignoring problems 
or going to a decisive authority to settle 
them. "It's not very often you're offered 
this sort of remedy. It takes a while to 
generate an appetite." 

Malinowksi is confident that medi-
ation can work, both at Yale and in the 
larger legal 
picture. "If there's 
something that's bothering two 
people," he asked, "why not try to 
resolve it? If it works, and it does a lot 
of the time, they'll leave the mediation 
with a much better relationship." 

Zimmerman hopes mediation will curb 
the frequency of lengthy and expensive 
litigation. "Often people escalate a 
conflict just so it becomes 'valid' 
enough to bring it to court." Last year, 
the American Bar Association created 
a new division solely for mediation and 
lawyers nationwide have established 
private mediation practices. "Medi-
ation is really taking off," Malinowski 
said. But at Yale, Zimmerman and 
!"falinowski are having trouble getting 
It off the ground.

Three years ago, Dan Gerwin OE '90) 
and Ami Kleinman (DC '90) dined in 
the Kosher Kitchen each week with four 
other students. Gerwin had recruited 
them to revive a dying orga~ization, 
Yale Student Friends of Israel. Under 
Gerwin's leadership, the resurrected 
YSFI became a social group devoted to 
learning more about Israel. YSFI 
forwarded neither a stated manifesto 
nor a 
political consensus, and 
members ranged from the far right to 
the far left. They argued about Israeli 
cinema, passed around back issues of 
The Jerusalem Post, and chatted in 
Hebrew. 

In December 1987, the Intifadah, 
Palestinian 
upnsmgs against the 
Israelis in the Occupied Territories, 
began and YSFI's non-political days 
ended. Though the group still made 
falafel and danced to Israeli music, 
unrest on the West Bank became a 
major topic of conversation. The 
discussion attracted new members, 
and today the group boasts thirty 
participants. 

Kleinman explained the changes in 
the group. "When there's an opposing 
force, you have to start dealing with 
more political issues," he said. The 
Coalition for Palestinian Rights 
represented such a force. Concerned 
by Israeli treatment of Palestinian 
settlers, Mario Kashou (BR '91) and 
~David Ranz (BR '91) founded CPR in 
l the fall of 1988. "We wanted to educate 
: the Yale community about what's been 
'i happening in the West Bank. People 
§ shouldn't take one medium or one 
~ voice as the truth," said Christina 
~ Erickson (DC '92), CPR's current 
president. This year, five core members 
attend CPR meetings regularly. 

Unlike YSFI, CPR has a clear poli-
tical agenda. In this year's edition of 
The Yale, CPR defines itself as a human 
rights group advocating a two-state 
solution in the Occupied Territories. 
"We hope to educate the average 
American voter," Erickson said. 

Over the past year YSFI and CPR 
have tried to get their messages out. 
This spring, CPR is holding three 
panel discussions on Arab-Israeli 
relations. Three weeks ago, YSFI 
screened A Search For Solid Ground, a 
television program about Israeli 
perspectives on the Intifadah. A CPR 
forum 
on March 
29th drew 
a 
smattering of middle-aged adults and 
some members from both groups, but 
few other students showed up. The 
turnout was typical for both CPR and 
YSFI events. 

YSFI and CPR rely on table tents 
for their real interaction with the Yale 
campus. Though both groups contend 
they do not necessarily oppose each · 
other, the aggressiv¢ tones of the table · 
tents might belie this assertion. One 
YSFI table tent blames Palestinian 
Liberation Organization leader Yasir 
Arafat for condoning the Tiananmen 
massacre. A CPR table tent rhetori-
cally asks "who fears our careful 
documentation of the Israeli army's 
human rights abuses?" 

Gerwin, who quit the group he helped 
found, is displeased with YSFI's table 
tent tactics. "CPR tries to discredit Israel 
andYSFI tries to discredit the PLO," he 
said. "It looks fairly childish." After 
attending a YSFI meeting last fall, 
Gerwin went away feeling disgusted. 
"People were 
incredibly angry, 
defensive, and reactionary. Defending 
Israel was not what we were about. 
YSFI is not a branch of the Israeli 
army." Gerwin 
even 
dislikes 
the 
group's name, which he believes has 
contributed to the group's political 
orientation. "I think YSFI is a cheesy 
name." 

Other YSFI members say that 
publi- opinion on Israel forced the 
group to change. "The political aspect 
was brought about by the negative 
propaganda," said Sam Schwartz (TC 
'91 ), YSFI's current president. Still, 
Schwartz denies that YSFI is fighting a 
table tent war. "Last year CPR pub-
lished a number of table tents which we 
found offensive," he said. "Our policy 
is that we don't respond to the table 
tents CPR puts out. It's not worth our -
while to respond to slanders which we 
don't even 
find 
constructive." 

Kleinman believes that YSFI, even in 
its earliest days, was actively prq-
Israel. "YSFI is doing now what I think 
is a major, if unspoken, part of the 
charter." 

CPR also denies that they are 
engaged in a battle of table tents. 
Group members consider themselves 
both pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian. 
"Criticizing Israel does not mean that 
you hate Jews or hate Israel. It just 
means that you are opposed to some of 
Israel's policies," states Jeff Finkelstein 
(MC '92), a CPR member. "I'm not an 
anti-Zionist. 
I 
support 
Israel's 
existence," he said. "But it's founded on 
the ideal to save a people from perse-
cution, not to persecute other people." 

Many members of YSFI aJ;~;ree with 
Finkelstein. Though some YSFI mem-
bers wholeheartedly support Israeli 
policies, others are Peace Now activists 
in favor of dialogue with the PLO. Still 
others think the Israeli electoral system 
should be overhauled. With so many 
disparate voices, it is difficult for YSFI 
to get its members to agree on a 
political message. A YSFI table tent 
needs to receive majority approval 
before it is distributed, but it is not 
representative of the entire group. 

"The majority of what YSFI has done 
this semester has been putting out 
political table tents," said Jason 
Glasgow (PC '90), president of YSFI 
last year. "People aren't exactly happy 
with that. A lot of table tents haven't 
been particularly productive at all." 

As the Intifadah wears on, YSFI 
struggles to define its role on campus. 
The tension between varying political 
agendas within the group begs the 
question, "Can you have your falafel 
and eat it too?" 


**Extended Vacation**

Last spring the Arthur M. Rosenberg 
Company held a massive sale before 
closing its doors for the last time. Mter 
seventy years of selling preppy suits 
and ties, the clothier on the corner of 
York and Elm streets finally went out 
of business. "I felt like they were here 
forever," said Beverly Eliasoph, owner 
of the Guilford Trading Company. 

Today, advertisements from Eliasoph's 
shop, Graham Travel, Karen Alexis 
and the Daily Caffe dress the large 
wmdows where Rosenberg once d is-
played khaki pants and blue blazers. 
Impact M anagement, which handles 
leasing 
for 
this Yale-owned 
building, provides free advertising 
space for these four merchants, all of 
whom rent property from the Univer-
sity. According to the Yale Real Estate 
Office, Impact will offer the windows 
for promotional purposes until a new 
tenant moves into the Rosenberg 
building. 

Because the four businesses do not 
get the commercial traffic that stores 
on Chapel Street and Broadway enjoy, 
the Rosenberg building gives the 
advertisers added visibility. Eliasoph 
called the corner "a perfect location," 
and said that the displays helped boost 
Christmastime sales. Barry Cobden, 
owner of 
Boola 
Boola, 
Campus 
Clothing, and Cobden's General Store, 
who does not rent shop space from 
Yale, thinks be m issed out on a good 
chance to advertise. "We certamJy 
would have welcomed the advertising 
opportunity," be said. "We like to feel 
we are part of the Yale community." 

Impact M anagement hopes to find a 
tenant to take over the building soon. 
Other area merchants wonder why the 
property has remained empty for so 
long. •It's a shame to leave it empty," 
said Chuck Caldwell, owner of T he 
Game. "It's not helping the community 
any." 

Karen Alexis, owner of the Park 
Street store which bears her name, is 
not surprised that Impact Manage-
ment cannot find a new occupant. "It 
seems to me that Yale has a lot of 
empty commercial spaces," she said. 
Alexis pointed out that the University-
owned space next door to her store, 
vacated in J anuary, still has no tenant. 
She suggested that property owned by 
Yale 
is 
no 
longer attractive to 
prospective renters. "People don't want 
to do business in downtown New 
H aven," she said. "It's not safe for me 
to be here in my store alone. A lot of 
my better customers from out of town 
are afraid to come to New H aven." 

Alexis holds Yale responsible. "Yale 
does not contribute to safety on New 
H aven's streets or help to create 
com mercial business," she said. Alexis 
plans to move out of New Haven soon. 

Beth Judd, associate director of 
Impact Management, is unsure how 
much longer the large blue "Arthur M. 
Rosenberg" sign will bang outside the 
building that the clothier vacated last 
year. "The building will be occupied as 
soon as the right tenant is found," said 
Judd. In the meantime, the Rosenberg 
building remains the most elaborate 
billboard in New Haven.

Turning the Beat Around 
Danny and the Juniors promised us 
"Rock and roll is here to stay," but they 
weren't completely right. According to 
popular optmon , 
only "classic 
rock"- music made, for the most part, 
by white males between 1964 and 
1970-has stood the test of time. Old 
songs like "My Generation" and 
"Sympathy for the Devil" were never 
relegated to the oldies bin; these tunes 
continue to permeate our lives through 
radio play and compact 
disc 
marketing. 

Rock and roll is warped by the 
process of canonization just like every 
other cultural form, 
be it 
the 
Nineteenth Century American Novel 
or professional baseball before Jackie 
Robinson. 

The stories told 
by 
oppressed groups such as African 
Americans, 
women and gays are 
marginalized, 
tokenized or dele-
gatea altogether by the institutions 
that get to write the 
histori~s-
academia, halls of fame, magazines 
and radio stations. Disco, for example, 
started in gay clubs, was built around 
black musical styles and featured a 
large proportion of female stars like 
Donna Summer, Sister Sledge and 
Anita Wood. 

Disco's conquest of 
America is an underdog story of epic 
proportions. Yet a decade down the 
line, we snicker at "We Are Family." 

The marketing of CDs has accelerated 
the whitewash of rock and roll in the 
last few years. On CD, the music in-
10 The New Journal/ April 20, 1990 
dustry re-sells us our past, rewriting it 
in the process. (If disco great Sylvester 
never makes it onto CD, in ten years 
he'll simply be extinct.) Pop music, the 
center of youth culture since Elvis, is 
growing more and more nostalgic. 

Since baby boomers are the largest 
consumer market, their past dominates 
the sales drive. The rest of us are just 
along for the marketing ride. And what 
a long, strange trip it's been: a 
generation that grew up with the 
Village People becomes convinced that 
our real musical heroes should be a 
bunch of geriatric Brits. 

Why do we need heroes anyway? 
Or, to be more specific, why do we 
need to idealize one musical era 
instead of indulging in an eclectic past 
and an eternal present? Rather than 
bagging 
ideal of the canon 
altogether, 
let's 
grant that 
most 
generations need the Good Old Days 
to hold as a standard against which to 
judge the present. But if that's the case, 
why can't we at least manage to feel 
nostalgic for our own past, instead of 
the past of our parents? 

The party line is that classic rock is 
simply better. On an aesthetic level, 
this point is moot. It is as useless to 
argue about the musical superiority of 
classic rock to disco as it is to pit 
Chuck Berry against Beethoven. Every 
art chooses a set of standards best 
suited to communicating its own 
values. The real question to ask here, 
then, 
is 
how do 
values 
communicated by classic rock compare 
to those expressed by disco? Well, let's 
make 
a 
little point-by-point 
comparison. Obviously, 
making 
general arguments about entire 
musical movements is going to involve 
mess of oversimplifications. But 
that's what the naive celebration of an 
era is all about. 

1. Politics: protest vs. pleasure. There 
aren't too many disco songs about the 
environment, world hunger, or the 
budget deficit. Classic rock, on the 
other hand, is the genre of The Big 
Statement. But classic rock's vague 
social conscience 
means · little 
in 


--- Page 11 ---

practical terms. It does not say 
anything about how its fans should be 
treating other people or themselves, 
only how the people in power ought to 
be acting, as if the power structure 
cared what we think. Disco, on the 
other hand, turns nebulous hippie 
utopianism inward, to discover a far 
more 
radical 
ideal: 
the pleasure 
principle. Reflected back out on the 
rest of the world, disco's hedonistic 
individualism in turn demands the 
tolerance of each person's right to the 
pursuit of happiness. An explosion of 
diversity rarely matched by any 
cultural movement in American 
history resulted from the disco ethos. 

Consider the Village People, self-
conscious icons for the disco era. They 
were a gay, racially integrated group 
representing grand 
synthese~ of 
American antagonists. Cowboy and 
J .... ~- /", "~///_//% 
'\'' 
~ 
/ 
/, 
: 
Indian, Cop and Biker, 
and Soldier. Compare this 
heterogeneity 
to 
narrowmindedness of the 
rockhead response to disco 
heyday- homophobic "Disco 
t-shirts and record-burning. 
Laborer 
glorious 
brutal 
classic 
in its 
Sucks" 

2. Sensibility: intentionality vs. camp. 
This isn't a matter of themes or even 
rhetorical strategies, but rather of the 
underlying assumptions about how 
lyrics will be interpreted. Even at his 
most ironic, Mick Jagger damn well 
expects to be taken seriously. He's 
invested a lot in his credibility. He 
writes his own songs, his band plays 
its own music. He's supposed to 
have earned the right to tell us what to 
think. The Village People, on the other 
hand, challenge their audience to 
laugh at them, and are ready in turn to 
laugh right back. Making no claims to 
authority, they tear everyone else's 
down. 

On a 
basic level of personal 
autonomy, 
disco has the 
advantage of letting you have your 
heroes and laugh at them too. Even as 
practical political arguments, disco's 
camp sensibility translates into a 
subversive power every bit as potent as 
rock earnestness. 

Protest 
songs, trapped by an obligation to 
mean something, signal their inten-
tions and can only preach to the 
converted or bounce off deaf ears. The 
only audience whose hearts and minds 
might actually be won are new fans, 
obliged by the rules of the game to buy 
into their heroes' politics. If you are a 
Bob Dylan 
fan, 
you're supposed 
to support his populist poli-
tics. 

Because 
disco 
never 
demands that we understand, it can 
hint at 
far 
more. 

Consider 
marvelously subversive "In the Navy," a 
paean to male bonding which the 
Navy actually attempted to buy as a 
recruitment jingle. I 
assume they 
didn't get the joke at fJISt, but they 
must have been let in on it eventually. 

Even if they never did, the point was 
already made for the world to see and 
giggle at- the American military 
stumbled upon a language it had 
refused to accept, admitting in the 
process that male bonding and 
gay sex are on more common 
ground than either the military or the 
Supreme Court would like to admit. 

3. Community: concert os. ~. 
You go to a Paul McCartney concert, 
and what are you expected to do? Stare 
up at the stage, or, more likely, at the 
Th~ N~w Journal/April 20, 1990 II 


--- Page 12 ---

giant TV screen above. Sing along 
with the songs. Clap. Hold up your 
lighter at the end. This is the classic 
rock vision of community, one which, 
as rockers such as Pink Floyd have 
observed, places it in the company of 
such 
phenomena 
as 
fascist 
rallies- social bonding through 
uniform experience. In disco, on the 
other hand, every audience member 
invents the experience for him or 
herself. Since the fans are almost 
always dancing to an invisible pre-
recorded track, each participant's 
attention is focused on the other 
dancers. The disco community is 
united through diverse expressions of a 
common experience. 

The present is a fun place; more Yalies 
ought to visit it some time. But it 
might just be that every era needs a 
past to which it can cling. We don't 
have to free fall forever through the 
generation gap; 
we become 
tomorrow's yuppies, the advertisers 
might flatter us by idealizing the '70s. 
It's not like disco ever died; it just 
renamed itself Madonna. As hip-hop 
and house music propel us into the 90s, 
classic rock atavism is looking sillier 
and sillier. As we look for a new model 
for rock and roll, the Me Decade looks 
more like a golden age. Help speed the 
process along. Let's turn our tie-dyes 
into dust rags, pull out those white 
suits, and dance the night away.

**Yale Recycling: From Barrels to Budget**
**Author: Not specified**
**Page number(s): 15**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
In 1981 two Yale Law School students
decided that the University should
begin recycling its wastepaper. Their
entire operation consisted of eight
barrels, an old station wagon and no
money. A handful of students spent
their afternoons emptying the barrels
and
then hauling paper off to
the Hershman Recycling Company in
New Haven. Although none of these
pioneer recyclers earned a salary,
everyone involved in the project took
home what
they called "psychic
income." Today, 41 students make
daily runs to 80 spots on campus in a
Chevrolet flatbed truck and collect
wastepaper which they deliver to
dumpsters behind Ingalls Rink. The
operation is more sophisticated now;
the student collectors earn wages from
the Employment Office and the Strat-
ford Bailing Company picks up the
paper from the dumpsters twice a
month.


Yale Recycling currently
receives some money from the Uni-
versity on a
need basis, but the
administration has grown increasingly
eager to fund Yale Recycling. This
September, recycling will appear on
the University's official budget for the
first time.
By funding Yale Recycling, the
administration plans to relieve the
student group of some of the manage-
ment and labor involved in the
process. Last February, in an effort to
streamline the program, the Facilities
Management Office hired Cyril John
May (FES '89) as Yale's first Recycling
Coordinator. May, who worked with
Yale Recycling as a graduate student,
will help make the recycling system
run more efficiently.


The student-run organization will
still empty some of the wastepaper
barrels and take responsibility for most
of the campus educational programs.
But according to May, starting this
summer custodial and physical plant
workers will take over most of the
collection runs as part of their regular
job duties. "Ultimately we'd like to get
the custodial service doing most of the
regular pick-ups," he said.


May
stressed that the budget for recycling
will remain fairly tight, however, and
the administration does not plan to
hire new workers for the pick-ups.
"We're still trying to work a lot of this
out," said May. "Yale has never had a
program like this so it's hard to say
what the final results are going to be."


The University is taking over a pro-
gram that manages to recycle roughly
130 tons of newspaper and office paper
each year. Yet this figure represents
only 17 percent of all the recyclable
paper thrown out by Yalies and a mere
2 percent of the University's entire
wastestream,
which includes cans,
bottles and all material shipped to a
landfill for disposal. "We should be
doing better," said Adam Davis (BR
'90), current head of Yale Recycling.


A foot soldier in the war against

The state of Connecticut agrees.
Legislators have mandated that by the
end of 1990, all municipalities in the
state must reduce the garbage going
into the landfills by 30 percent.
Lawmakers have drawn up a list of
nine types of recyclable waste- inclu-
ding cardboard, office white paper,
newspaper and glass- which landfills
cannot accept after this year.


Both Davis and May suggest that
this statewide legislation has influenced
Yale's decision to put recycling on the
University's budget. But Alan Braun,
director of Facility Management,
worries that Yale will probably not
reach the 30 percent waste-reduction
goal by the end of the year. Yale

garbage. Each year Yale ships 6,000
tons of waste off the campus and in
that time the University goes through
15 tons of Post-It notes alone. Even
with a recycling program to help reduce
the wastestream, Yale's entire garbage
output has actually risen since the
program began in 1981.


Since the University still depends on
landfills for much of its garbage
disposal, New Haven's landfill crisis
has forced Yale to look elsewhere. The
city government planned to close the
overflowing New Haven dump three
months ago, but extended its term of
operation because of the absence of

**Yale Recycling Faces Challenges**

The garbage crunch in New Haven has led Yale to explore alternative disposal sites.  Last year, Yale began sending some waste to a resource recovery plant in Bridgeport, costing approximately $10,000 more per year than disposal in New Haven.  The University views recycling as a more attractive alternative.


Even with increased commitment, recycling at Yale faces challenges.  Space constraints on a tight campus, particularly on Old Campus where one drop-off point serves 1200 people, limit the number of recycling bins.  Fire regulations also impede the process, delaying approval of receptacle sites for months.


Yale recyclers can easily handle office and computer paper, but newspaper disposal is more difficult due to a market glut and limited recycling facilities near New Haven.  A portion of collected newspaper is sent to Korea and Great Britain, costing $25 per ton.  Despite this, recycling is still more cost-efficient than waste disposal, with recycling companies paying $45 per ton of white office paper and $60 per ton of computer paper, compared to $90 per ton for landfill disposal in New Haven.  However, the financial benefits will be delayed due to initial investments in equipment and process refinement.


Yale's recycling program looks to Brown University as a model, where recycling is a reality rather than just a political issue.  Brown's comprehensive program, implemented three years ago, is overseen by the administration and involves regular collection from receptacles in all dormitory rooms.  This program was implemented in response to a Rhode Island law mandating a 45 percent waste reduction.


This September, recycling will appear on the University's official budget for the first time.  While Yale hopes to follow Brown's lead, there is skepticism about the extent of custodial worker involvement.  Students are expected to continue playing a significant role in collection for at least another year; however, there are concerns that increased administrative involvement might lead to student complacency.  Despite these challenges, the core of the recycling effort remains the same: collecting paper, even on rainy days.

A Movement Divided 
Laura Bradford 
AI Marder and fellow members of the 
New Haven Free South Africa 
Coalition went to the Palace Theater to 
denounce 
real 
estate 
mogul Joel 
Schiavone. 
They 
left 
lambasting not only Schiavone, the 
theater's owner, but also the South 
African Action ·Committee, another 
anti-apartheid organization. Both 
groups came to the Palace on August 
30, 1987 to protest Schiavone's plans to 
vacation in South Africa with the 
Young President's Organization, a 
group of high ranking businessmen. 
The YPO planned to gamble in Sun 
City, meet with then Prime Minister 
P . W. Botha, and shop at the South 
African diamond mines. After private 
meetings with Schiavone had .failed to 
convince him to change his plans, 
Coalition 
members decided 
to 
demand publically that he cancel his 
trip. 

While Marder and other 
Coalition members spoke 
into 
a 
microphone in front of the Palace, 
SAAC activists weaved through the 
crowd, encouraging people to boycott 
the theater. 
Marder, 
committed 
to private 
negotiation and 
public statement, 
thought the SAAC boycott caused 
more harm than good. "A boycott of 
the Palace was an idea that the 
Coalition had already rejected," 
Marder said. He emphasized that 
boycotts depend on large amounts of 
effort and organization. "We didn't 
want to undermine genuine commu-
nity outrage by announcing an empty 
threat." SAAC member Frank 
Panzarella thought the Coalition 
would never get anywhere with their 
approach. A boycott, he thought, 
might do the trick. "Anything that 
deals a blow to the pocketbook of the 
person you're targeting is effective," 
said Panzarella. 

In spite of the hubbub, Schiavone 
journeyed to South Africa as planned 
in October, 1987. "A lot of what you 
hear about conditions in South Africa 
.20 The New .Journal/April 2(/, 1990 
The Panzarellas, former anti-war protesters, think New Haven is big 
enough for more than one anti-apartheid group. 
is just nonsense," he said. "The New 
Haven protest was staged by a bunch 
of crazy people to express their own 
self-righteousness." 

Marder blames the SAAC for mud-
dling efforts 
to stop Schiavone. 
Because SAAC publicized their plans 
at the Coalition's Palace press 
conference, many people assumed that 
Marder's group also supported the 
boycott. Representatives from non-
profit organizations like Columbus 
House and the Connecticut Food 
Bank, which held fund raisers in the 
theater rent-free, called the Coalition 
wondering if they should cancel their 
events. 

Although the boycott never won 
widespread support, Panzarella said it 
was valuable as a symbolic gesture. 
J ust prior to Schiavone's departure, the 
Board of Aldermen made a symbolic 
gesture of its own. The Board named 
the intersection of College and Chapel 
streets "Bishop Tutu Corner." The 
crossing overlooks much of Schiavone's 
property. 

The Schiavone incident typifies the 
rift between the Coalition and SAAC. 
On a crusade for the same cause, the 
two groups employ different tactics. 
Rather than advancing their common 
goals, they often have resorted to 
antagonism and backbiting. With the 
recent developments in South Africa, 
both groups struggle to define their 
present role in local efforts. 

The New Haven anti-apartheid 
movement started in the fall of 1984 
with the formation of the Coalition. 
When the South African government 
jailed eleven union organizers, New 
Haven labor leaders Frank Carrano 
and Andrea Cole coordinated a local 
response. "We initiated a support 
movement within the New Haven 
labor groups to show our solidarity 
from halfway across the world," said 
Carrano. At the first meeting of the 
Coalition, 25 people representing 
several organizations, including the 
NAACP and the Downtown Co-op 
Ministry, launched a campaign calling 
for 
New 
Haven 
to divest 
from 
companies with holdings in South 
Africa. 


Coalition members took up nego-
-tiation as their primary strategy right 
from the beginning. Since the city uses 
retirement funds for its principal 
investments, the Coalition set out to 
convince N ew R aven's pension boards 
that divestment would be a fiscally 
responsible move. If New Raven's 
legislators would agree to divest, the 
Coalition argued, 
the 
city could 
actually increase 
revenue 
by re-
inve sting 
m 
more profitab le 
companies. 

While the Coalition lobbied behind 
closed doors, Panzarella, his wife 
Paula and several friends founded the 
South African Action Committee. "We 
were impatient with the Coalition's 
quiet process of negotiation," said 
Frank P anzarella. T he newly formed 
group wanted more public agitation 
against apartheid. "We didn't think 
any one group should have a franchise 
on the anti-apartheid movement," said 
Paula Panzarella. 

"A lot of what you hear 
about conditions in 
South Mrica is just 
nonsense." 

While SAAC shared the Coalition's 
commitment to divestment, Com-
mittee members opted for a more 
~assroots approach. They began 
distributing leaflets to city employees 
urging them to support divestment. 
Aubrey W illiams, a New Haven fire-
fighter, learned a thing or two about 
New Raven's 
fmances. "Until 
leaflets came out, we were unaware 
that our money was going to South 
Africa," Williams said. When the city's 
pension boards finally voted to divest 
all its funds in August 1985, both th_e 
SAAC and the Coalition took credtt

for the victory. T he Panzarellas claim 
that their leafletting cam paign amassed 
the needed support for divestment. 
Coalition members maintain that the 
broad constituency they mobilized in 
favor of divestment carried the day. 

Spurred by the New Haven divest-
ment campaign and searching for a 
new focal point, the SAAC tried to 
shape Yale's emerging anti-apartheid 
movement. "Yale students were still 
involved in discussion and education," 
Paula Panzarella said. "They d idn't 
know how to organize an effective 
protest." She thought they could forge 
a relationship that would prove vital in 
tackling the Yale Corporation. 

While the Coalition also supported 
fledgling studen t 
movem ent, 
M arder felt SAAC's hands-on tactic 
was inappropriate. "Yale students had 
the primary responsibility to organize 
their own efforts," he said . "In a sense 
they are a village within our city and 
their leadership had to come from the 
Yale community." Although willing to 
assist student 
projects, 
members stressed the separateness of 
two groups. 
W hen students 
decided to build shanties in Beinecke 
Plaza, the Coalition helped them with 
carpentry. Still, according to Marder, 
the success of the campus divestment 
movement rested with the students. 

During the spring of 1986, the 
student protesters 
g rabbed 
attention of the entire city. They 
staged numerous rallies, clashe? with 
local police and blockaded port1ons of 
the campus. The student body joined 
the Yale Coalition Against Apartheid 
in demanding that the University sell 
its $300 m illion of South African 
assets. 

SAAC claim s they radicalized the 
student m ovemen t. "Studen ts were just 
beginning to realize the importance of 
public 
involvement," said 
Frank 
Pan zarella. 
H e 
points to SAAC's 
picketing 
of then 
P resident 
Bart 
G iamatti's house in October 1985 as 
the seminal event in the student 
movement's maturation. 

Panzarella 
claims the students needed SAAC to 
n udge 
them 
in to 
act1v1ty. 
"The 
students were waffling," he said. "They 
weren't sure if they really wanted to go 
over the edge with the struggle." 

According to Panzarella, SAAC took 
CAA under its wing and gave the 
students confidence to build the 
shan ties on Beinecke Plaza. Al Lucas 
{BR '90), a member of CAA, said 
SAAC takes too much of the credit. 
"T hey did n't originate the idea for the 
shanties," h e 
said .

The elevator just would not come.
Dragging my "YALE U" backpack and my indestructible tan Samsonite. I climbed five flights of stairs to the Intensive Care Unit. I know I broke ICU etiquette, because the nurses stared at me in amazed silence. "This is the neurosurgery department at the Los Angeles County/University of Southern California hospital," their looks seemed to say, "Don't you think you'd be better off in a resort hotel?" I stammered that I was there for an externship with Dr. Michael Apuzzo (TD '61). Finally the nurses decided to page Dr. Tom Chen, the junior resident on call. When he came to meet me, he noticed my bags and decided that I should unpack first. I was thankful to get my embarrassing luggage out of there.

In the residents' dorm, I put my suitcase on the bed, donned a white coat and scrub clothes, and followed Dr. Chen to the Emergency Room.
The Sunday evening news droned from the TV in the waiting area outside the ER door. "Nonetheless, the spraying of crops, for now . . . will go . . . on," the anchorman announced dramatically.


Nobody paid any attention. We entered one of the cubicles used as a temporary holding area to see Estella, who had suffered a gunshot wound. Tom showed me where the bullet had entered the left side of her neck and had come out near her right shoulder. Her head was taped to the board beneath her, but her eyes followed us wildly. "Her spinal cord is OK," Tom told me, "but some of her vertebrae have been shattered. The question is whether she will be able to support her head or not."

"She needs X-rays," Dr. Chen told her husband, "we'll need to bend her neck away from her chest and then toward it." The husband played with the pink and blue fake feathers on his white straw hat as he spoke to her in Spanish; her eyes rolled, trying to find where he stood.


He put out a trembling hand to touch her hair, then cleaned off some of her smeared make-up. Dr. Chen called me over to help him, and I noticed that my hand was pressed protectively against my own neck. We had to force Estella's shoulders down so that the X-ray could get a clear picture. She had been quiet all that time. But she screamed then.

The X-rays showed that her vertebrae could still support her neck. She would wear a soft neck brace and go home in a week. "Bueno," Tom told her with an encouraging smile, but she didn't seem to believe him. Tom went to finish her paperwork, and her husband informed me, "She wanna peeess."

Peace? Yes, I could understand. "You know, shit, PISS!" he repeated. Startled into speech, I said that I couldn't speak Spanish, only to realize that he had addressed me in English. At that, the husband took his quest elsewhere.


The LAC/USC medical center is a large county hospital in East Los Angeles. Most of the soap opera-watching population would recognize it as the building in Genua[ Hospital. LAC/USC primarily serves patients without insurance, and the city and county absorb much of the costs. Anyone who attended public high school knows the look and feel of the place: long hallways, two-tone walls, the tired fluorescent lights and the smell of paint (all that painting and repainting). The nurses' stations in the wards are hulking and painted; nothing like the sleek wood-grain stations found in posher clinics.

scoffs at Panzarella's version of history .
"I can't recall seeing a member of 
SAAC at any CAA meetings that 
winter or spring," he said. 
"We didn't want to 
undermine genuine 
community outrage 
by announcing an 
empty threat." 
Morand said 
that community 
support was essential to the student 
protest. "The Administration can 
ignore the student voices, but when 
students and the community speak 
together, the University takes notice," 
he said. While the University has 
severely cut back on its investments in 
South Africa from over $300 million to 
$26 million today, the protesters never 
realized their goal for total Yale 
divestment. "Yale responds to the beck 
and call of the U.S. Governement and 
won't 
divest until the federal 
government does," said Paula 
Panzarella . 

In 
1987 
the Coal.ition 
Against 
Apartheid changed 1ts 
name to 
Students Against Apartheid, 
and 
announced that they would restrict 
their meetings to Yale students. "We 
needed to limit the protest to people 
who were in a position to demand 
something from Yale," Lucas said . 
Despite the changes in CAA, the two 
New Haven groups continued to 
squabble on campus. In February 
1989, SAAC and Yale's Black Law 
Students Association planned a forum 
featuring speakers from the African 
National Congress and other Southern 
African liberation groups. Promo-
tional posters for the event identified 
South Africa as Azania-an ancient 
name used by members of the Pan 
Africanist Congress. ANC speaker 


Ben Magubane suspected the forum's 
sponsors of ties with the PAC, a black 
nationalist group repudiated by the 
multi-racial ANC. According to 
Marder, Magubane saw the Coalition 
listed as an endorser of the event and 
called Marder to question the sponsor's 
politics. Marder said that SAAC never 
even asked the Coalition to endorse the 
forum. "The first I heard of the forum 
was when Magubane called me," he 
said. "I didn't know what he was 
talking about." 

Frank and Paula Panzarella claim 
Marder insinuated that SAAC 
supported the PAC . This allegation, 
the Panzarellas said, 
influenced 
Magubane's decision to withdraw from 
the forum . Other speakers followed 
suit, and the symposium never took 
place. In an AprillO, 1989letter to The 
New Haven Advocate, the Panzarellas 
denied any 'ties to the PAC and 
accused Marder of deliberately 
misleading Magubane. "Marder's ... 
sabotage of a significant opportunity 
for the people of New Haven to learn 
of southern Africa is the lowest depths 
we've seen of factionalizing in New 
Haven," they wrote. 

"We didn't think any 
one group should 
have a franchise on 
the anti-apartheid 
movement." 
Marder said he never discussed the 
SAAC's political affiliations with 
Magubane. "My only suggestion was 
that Magubane call SAAC directly," 
Marder said. "That was the last I heard 
of it until I was accused of all these 
nasty things." 

Since the forum fell apart last year, 
SAAC has been losing momentum. 
Now, confidence that apartheid is on 
the decline has tempered much of 
SAAC 's zeal for local protest. With the

de Klerk regime's recent reforms, 
SAAC members hint that they may 
soon abdicate their role in the battle. 
"In many ways this struggle is for the 
South African people themselves to 
resolve," said Paula Panzarella. SAAC 
met only once this year, when they 
held a party to celebrate Nelson 
Mandela's release.

members 
fear that 
progress in South Africa is overrated. 
"People think that they're on their way 
to freedom land," said Frank Carrano. 
"That's one of the dangers we have to 
guard against." Far from giving up the 
fight, the Coalition won't rest until the 
South African government abolishes 
apartheid. Pooling their resources with 
other groups, the Coalition has joined a 
Northeastern network of anti-
apartheid organizations. Pam Saffer, 
the Coalition's delegate to the 
North East South Africa Solidarity 
Network, said this organization allows 
groups from different cities to share 
information. 

As New 
Haven's 
anti-apartheid 
movement 
redefines 
itself, Joel 
Schiavone prepares for Connecticut's

think his past confrontations with the 
Coalition and SAAC will affect his bid 
for the Republican ticket. He antici-
pates that the only votes he will lose are 
those that come from the far left. "I 
wouldn't have gotten 
those votes 
anyway," he said.

R
sheepishly met senior resident Dr.
Craig Clark, Dr. Chen, and interns
Nicole Moayeri and Kurt Johnson. As
an extern I was to "run with the team"
whenever I wasn't with my sponsor,
Dr. Apuzzo ("Dr. A"). This meant that
I accompanied them on rounds, in
conference and in surgery. In my
scrubs and white coat I looked like part
of the team, and by the end of the week
some of the nurses greeted me with
"Hello, doctor." I couldn't bring myself
to admit that the title was still five
years away for me, that I knew about
the evolution of annelids but couldn't
give an injection to a patient.


In the wards there were patients
with conditions ranging from just-out-
of-ICU to ready-to-go-home. One
woman, who padded around in foam
slippers and a turban to cover her
shaved head, was ready to move to a
rehabilitation center after her
aneurism surgery. Dr. Moayeri and a
social worker were trying to find a
place for her, but she was an illegal
immigrant and almost no center could
or would accept her. Another patient,
Robert, talked only to me. I stopped
by his bed when the team moved on
and asked him how he was. He always
gave a surly "Okay," but it was a
triumph I had all to myself. Joe walked
through the wards and combed his hair
using shaving cream and looked
around with wide, crazed eyes. After
being threatened with surgery, he
began to improve rapidly. He liked to
play with words: "USC me-di-cal
center.
USC ma-ra-thon
center ... "


I met Dr. A , and we spent that
afternoon at his clinic. Unlike the
people at the county hospital, the men
and women
we saw here were
outpatients. Some of them would
eventually need surgery, some would
undergo radiotherapy, and still others
were continually monitored for
progress. In the examining room, each
pauent sat on a table while Dr. A sat
on a stool at the patient's knees. He
spoke in an earnest and entreating
voice that turned easily and often to
laughter. "Tell me about your job,
your kids, your new car" blended in
with "tell me about your back or your
headache." "If this much pain right
here is a dollar," he said to Sam, who
declared that he liked cities where he
made "tons-a-dough," "how much is it
down here?" He told Linda that she
needed a second surgery. She asked
whether her head had to be shaved
again. "' hate to look at myself when
all there is on me is a face," she said.
Dr. A comforted her. "It will grow
back beautifully. but look at me. rm
losing my hair-permanently," he
said.


Once back in his office, Dr. A
became serious. He once burst out,
"That thing is sitting in her head, she
could die if it acts up. We gotta do
something quick." I imagined it was
quite an ego trip to see someone on the
verge of death and, godlike, to give
that person life. But Dr. A believes
that happiness for a physician doesn't
come from a sense of power. "The
superiority act gets tiring after awhile.
You have to remember that the doctor
is the handmaiden of the patient, and
never the other way around."


That night I accompanied Dr. Scott
Litofsky on all-night call. We saw a
woman whom the police had found
unconscious on the road. The flesh on
the back of her head was torn and
craniospinal fluid from her brain
drained out of her ear. She couldn't tell
us her name, so the orderlies gave her
one-"Mary 35." The 35 represented
her approximate age. The cuts and
bruises on her abdomen and inner
thighs were the marks of sexual
assault. While Dr. Litofsky examined
her, she struggled in an effort to escape
from the restraints that kept her on the
hospital bed. I could do nothing but
feel useless in the medical costume I
wore. At Yale, I had been an excited
freshman but spent sophomore year
cursing organic chemistry and most of
last semester complaining about
physics. Why the hell? I often asked
myself. Standing with fists clenched on
the rail of ~ary 35's bed, I was
ashamed at how easily I had lost sight
of my goal over a benign problem set
or two.

Elga Wasserman helps women find 
rooms of their own. Although it is 
tricky work, she has had twenty years 
of practice. As a special assistant to Yale 
President Kingman Brewster from

to double up so'that women could have 
a place in the 'dorms.

she practices family law down the

comfortable office on Orange Street.

an acceptance of women in family

as a persuasive courtroom advocate. 
Greenfield remembers arguing against 
her in a divorce case. "She absolutely 
buried me," he said. As a divorce 
lawyer, Wasserman often represents 
women who have sacrificed their 
individuality for their families. "Unlike 
me," she said, 
"they devoted their 
entire lives to their husband's career 
and to their children." Wasserman 
helps these women recover a degree of 
independence. "I'm probably doing 
more for women as a divorce lawyer 
than I could anywhere else," she said. 

Wasserman began her working life 
as a chemist. She always thought she 
could balance married life and her 
career, but her colleagues felt 
28 The New .JournaVApril 20, 1990 
differently. 
She remembers their 
reaction when she announced her 
plans to wed ~ ' "People assumed," she 
said, "that I was lost to the cause of 
science." Her husband's job would 
determine her career path, colleagues 
warned. To some degree, they were 
right. 
Wasserman 
followed 
her 
husband to New Haven when he found 
a job at Yale, but she did not apply for 
a faculty position here. No women 
taught at the undergraduate level 
during the 
early 
postwar years. 
Instead, she worked full time as a 
research assistant in microbiology until 
the birth of her first child. For the next 
ten years, she worked part time in 
education and industry. 

In 1959, Wasserman returned to the 
lab. But she was soon overwhelmed by 
the competing demands of career and 
family. "I didn't think I could really be 
a first rate scientist and do justice by 
my family. Being a second rate scien-
tist didn't appeal to me," she said. She 
taught chemistry at the University of 
Southern Connecticut for a year and 
then accepted an assistant deanship in 
the sciences at Yale. For six years she 
administered grant and fellowship 
money. 

When Brewster decided to admit 
women to Yale College, he created the 
position of special assistant to the 
president 
on 
co-education. 
"Wasserman was the perfect choice," 
said Sam Chauncey, then a special 
assistant 
to 
President Brewster. 
Wassserman noted wryly that. she was 
an obvious choice. "I was one of very 
few female administrators around," she 
said. Originally, Brew~ter designated 
Trumbull College as the women's 
college, with Wasserman as Master. 
But Trumbull students protested, and 
although Wasserman argued tha,t the 
women should live in one college, the 
adminstration ultimately placed them 
in all twelve colleges. 

Chauncey and Wasserman selected 
independent and resilient women for 
Yale's first co-ed class. Once the 
women arrived, Wasserman met with 
women from all twelve colleges each 
week. 
When custodial workers 
installed full-length mirrors in all the 
women's rooms, 
studeniS 
complained that men were telling the 
women what they needed. Wassermatl 
also contended with administrato11

library at night. 

Wasserman's phone rang off the 
hook 
with 
calls 
from 
confused 
administrators. ·she remembers one 
dean who called her because a female 
student was dating a music teacher at 
another college. The dean wanted to 
know if he should call her parents. 
"Would he ever have called me if it were 
a male student?" Wasserman wonders. 
Another asked her in exasperation 
"Elga, what do you women want? 
Don't you realize that you are the ones 
who have the babies?" 

Barbara Deinhardt, a member of the 
class of 1973 who worked in the Office 
of the Education of Women with 
Wasserman, remembers that she was 
always "solidly supportive" of the 
women . 
Deinhardt 
assisted 
W~sserman in assembling a publi-
cauon called "She," a directory of 
women's services, resources and female 
faculty members. Nevertheless, for 
many of the women, Wasserman 
remained an untapped resource. 
"Many of us didn't perceive the kinds 
of dif!iculties we were having," said 
Assoc1ate Professor of English Susanne 
Wofford, also a member of the first 
class of women. "We didn't perceive 
the importance of Yale having 
someone like her available to talk to." 

After that first year, Wasserman 
devoted her efforts to increasing the 
number of female faculty and students 
at ~ale. She also pushed for affirmative 
action. 
From 1970 to 1972, she 
traveled around the country speaking 
to alumni groups, reassuring them that 
"nothing terrible was going to happen 
because Yale had admitted women." 
One of the alumni groups cancelled 
her speaking engagement because it 
met in a building that would not allow 
women inside. On the whole, however, 
Wasserman found that the alumni 
welcomed women to Yale. 

By 1972, after three intense years in 
the spotlight, Wasserman felt burnt 
out, and she took a leave of absence 
from Yale. "She went through a 
process of becoming more and more 
cynical," said Deinhardt. "She became 
increasingly frustrated by the admini-
stration's lack of commitment to 
equalizing the experience of women at 
Yale." Before she left the University, 
Wasserman demanded that Yale hire 
and admit more women. "Everything 
else 
was 
irrelevant," she said. 

Wasserman remains dissatisfied with 
the continuing lack of role models for 
young women, and asks, "How can a 
woman student aspire to become a 
professor when every professor she has 
is male?" 
"Eventually Wasserman thought she 
would be able to make more of a 
difference elsewhere," Deinhardt said. 
Wasserman left Yale in 1972 and 
began to explore some of her own 
interests. She spent a few months 
conducting a 
study of female 
academics in foreign countries, 
inspired by her observation that a 
disproportionately high number of 
women in American universities were 
foreign born. Wasserman concluded 
that in the U.S., these women felt 
free of binding cultural norms. "They 
were pulled out of their own cultures," 
Wasserman observed, "so they could 
do what they wanted." Wasserman 
herself came to America from another 
country. Born in Germany, she fled 
Nazi oppression when she was only 
twelve.

moved on 
to the 
Carnegie Commission on Children, 
where she studied the need for daycare 
in a society with increasing numbers of 
double-income families. The daycare 
issue continues to upset Wasserman 
today. She points out that Yale still 
lacks adequate childcare facilities for 
its faculty and employees. As a mother 
with a career, Wasserman often felt 
guilty leaving her children to go to work. 
"When I was still a rarity working, 
"We're giving lip 
service to equality but 
people aren't willing to 
accept it." 
whatever went wrong with the kids 
would be blamed on the fact that I had 
a career," she said. 

Even when a man tries to adapt his 
lifestyle to relieve some of these 
pressures on his wife, he often faces 
public criticism. Wasserman believes 
that condemning President Benno 
Schmidt and his wife, Helen Whitney, 
for not spending enough time on 
campus, reveals a double standard. 
"We're giving lip service to equality but 
people aren't willing to accept it," she 
said. 

Wasserman complains that 
society expects too much of career 
women. "You're supposed to exercise 
and relax and socialize and read and 
pay attention to your kids and your job 
and your appearance and your teeth 
and the news- how can you do all 
that?" Though Wasserman seems to 
have mastered the juggling act herself, 
she suggests that women can onlY 
achieve true equality by dropping 
some of the balls .
