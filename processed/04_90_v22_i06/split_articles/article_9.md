**Yale Recycling Faces Challenges**

The garbage crunch in New Haven has led Yale to explore alternative disposal sites.  Last year, Yale began sending some waste to a resource recovery plant in Bridgeport, costing approximately $10,000 more per year than disposal in New Haven.  The University views recycling as a more attractive alternative.


Even with increased commitment, recycling at Yale faces challenges.  Space constraints on a tight campus, particularly on Old Campus where one drop-off point serves 1200 people, limit the number of recycling bins.  Fire regulations also impede the process, delaying approval of receptacle sites for months.


Yale recyclers can easily handle office and computer paper, but newspaper disposal is more difficult due to a market glut and limited recycling facilities near New Haven.  A portion of collected newspaper is sent to Korea and Great Britain, costing $25 per ton.  Despite this, recycling is still more cost-efficient than waste disposal, with recycling companies paying $45 per ton of white office paper and $60 per ton of computer paper, compared to $90 per ton for landfill disposal in New Haven.  However, the financial benefits will be delayed due to initial investments in equipment and process refinement.


Yale's recycling program looks to Brown University as a model, where recycling is a reality rather than just a political issue.  Brown's comprehensive program, implemented three years ago, is overseen by the administration and involves regular collection from receptacles in all dormitory rooms.  This program was implemented in response to a Rhode Island law mandating a 45 percent waste reduction.


This September, recycling will appear on the University's official budget for the first time.  While Yale hopes to follow Brown's lead, there is skepticism about the extent of custodial worker involvement.  Students are expected to continue playing a significant role in collection for at least another year; however, there are concerns that increased administrative involvement might lead to student complacency.  Despite these challenges, the core of the recycling effort remains the same: collecting paper, even on rainy days.
