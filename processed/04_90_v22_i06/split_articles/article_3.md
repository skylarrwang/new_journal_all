Editor's Note 
We have watched the sun rise for three days in a row now, and we're 
slightly behind schedule on our first production weekend as a new staff. 


As we scramble to write headlines, develop photos and lay down copy, 
we stop to remember our friend Chris Warfield, who would have been a 
member of our staff. 


Last winter break, after two months in the hospital, Chris died from 
complications of lupus, an immuno-deficiency disease. When we 
returned to campus to tackle our first issue of the semester, we hoped she 
might be back to work with us. During reading period, we had visited 
her in the infirmary at University Health Services, where she talked 
about plans for The New Journal. 


Chris never stopped asking about the magazine. Sometimes we felt 
awkward sitting on the orange vinyl couch in her room at UHS, but 
Chris always tried to make us feel comfortable. She laughed at our 
stories of production crises and offered us chocolate chip cookies that the 
doctors wouldn't let her eat herself. 


Chris started coming to writers' meetings at the crarrtped TNJ office 
on Crown Street in the fall of 1988. We had all just joined the magazine 
and were eargerly throwing .out ideas for stories. Chris thoughtfully 
listened to the other writers and began to generate some ideas of her 
own. Her first story, about a School of Music program for gifted high 
school graduates, appeared in the April 21, 1989 issue of TNJ. 


In March 1989, Chris was elected circulation manager. When she 
took on the job, Chris really threw herself into it. She drew up route 
lists, called people the night before each issue came out, and got to know 
almost everyone on the staff. Barreling around campus behind the wheel 
of a bulky U-Haul truck, Chris distributed 11,000 copies of TNJ. 


Sometimes she ran red lights or double parked, blasting the radio and 
cracking jokes as she drove. Chris said she purposely chose the position 
of circulation manager because it involved physical work and she wanted 
to challenge herself. Even when it rained during circulation, as it 
invariably did, she never complained. 


Chris couldn't run circulation from the hospital, but she continued to 
think about the magazine. When we visited her at UHS during her last 
weeks there, she bubbled over with ideas for TN]s future. "We'll make 
T-shirts, organize parties and really boost spirit," she said. "I want to 
make the magazine better!" 


We hope to carry on The New .Journal as Chris would have wanted. We 
will miss her. 


As Commencement approaches, The New Journal wishes to acknowledge 
the important contributions made to the magazine by members of the 
Class of 1990. We extend our thanks to Ethan Cohen, Ruth Conniff, 
David Greenberg, Stephen Hooper, John Kim and Jamie Workman for 
all their hard work, talent and enthusiasm. Their dedication has shaped 
The New Journal. We are grateful for the time and energy that they 
devoted to the magazine, and we wish them the best of luck in their 
future endeavors.
