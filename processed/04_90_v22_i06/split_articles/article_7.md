Turning the Beat Around 
Danny and the Juniors promised us 
"Rock and roll is here to stay," but they 
weren't completely right. According to 
popular optmon , 
only "classic 
rock"- music made, for the most part, 
by white males between 1964 and 
1970-has stood the test of time. Old 
songs like "My Generation" and 
"Sympathy for the Devil" were never 
relegated to the oldies bin; these tunes 
continue to permeate our lives through 
radio play and compact 
disc 
marketing. 

Rock and roll is warped by the 
process of canonization just like every 
other cultural form, 
be it 
the 
Nineteenth Century American Novel 
or professional baseball before Jackie 
Robinson. 

The stories told 
by 
oppressed groups such as African 
Americans, 
women and gays are 
marginalized, 
tokenized or dele-
gatea altogether by the institutions 
that get to write the 
histori~s-
academia, halls of fame, magazines 
and radio stations. Disco, for example, 
started in gay clubs, was built around 
black musical styles and featured a 
large proportion of female stars like 
Donna Summer, Sister Sledge and 
Anita Wood. 

Disco's conquest of 
America is an underdog story of epic 
proportions. Yet a decade down the 
line, we snicker at "We Are Family." 

The marketing of CDs has accelerated 
the whitewash of rock and roll in the 
last few years. On CD, the music in-
10 The New Journal/ April 20, 1990 
dustry re-sells us our past, rewriting it 
in the process. (If disco great Sylvester 
never makes it onto CD, in ten years 
he'll simply be extinct.) Pop music, the 
center of youth culture since Elvis, is 
growing more and more nostalgic. 

Since baby boomers are the largest 
consumer market, their past dominates 
the sales drive. The rest of us are just 
along for the marketing ride. And what 
a long, strange trip it's been: a 
generation that grew up with the 
Village People becomes convinced that 
our real musical heroes should be a 
bunch of geriatric Brits. 

Why do we need heroes anyway? 
Or, to be more specific, why do we 
need to idealize one musical era 
instead of indulging in an eclectic past 
and an eternal present? Rather than 
bagging 
ideal of the canon 
altogether, 
let's 
grant that 
most 
generations need the Good Old Days 
to hold as a standard against which to 
judge the present. But if that's the case, 
why can't we at least manage to feel 
nostalgic for our own past, instead of 
the past of our parents? 

The party line is that classic rock is 
simply better. On an aesthetic level, 
this point is moot. It is as useless to 
argue about the musical superiority of 
classic rock to disco as it is to pit 
Chuck Berry against Beethoven. Every 
art chooses a set of standards best 
suited to communicating its own 
values. The real question to ask here, 
then, 
is 
how do 
values 
communicated by classic rock compare 
to those expressed by disco? Well, let's 
make 
a 
little point-by-point 
comparison. Obviously, 
making 
general arguments about entire 
musical movements is going to involve 
mess of oversimplifications. But 
that's what the naive celebration of an 
era is all about. 

1. Politics: protest vs. pleasure. There 
aren't too many disco songs about the 
environment, world hunger, or the 
budget deficit. Classic rock, on the 
other hand, is the genre of The Big 
Statement. But classic rock's vague 
social conscience 
means · little 
in

practical terms. It does not say 
anything about how its fans should be 
treating other people or themselves, 
only how the people in power ought to 
be acting, as if the power structure 
cared what we think. Disco, on the 
other hand, turns nebulous hippie 
utopianism inward, to discover a far 
more 
radical 
ideal: 
the pleasure 
principle. Reflected back out on the 
rest of the world, disco's hedonistic 
individualism in turn demands the 
tolerance of each person's right to the 
pursuit of happiness. An explosion of 
diversity rarely matched by any 
cultural movement in American 
history resulted from the disco ethos. 

Consider the Village People, self-
conscious icons for the disco era. They 
were a gay, racially integrated group 
representing grand

American antagonists. Cowboy and

heterogeneity 
to 
narrowmindedness of the 
rockhead response to disco 
heyday- homophobic "Disco 
t-shirts and record-burning.

brutal 
classic 
in its

2. Sensibility: intentionality vs. camp. 
This isn't a matter of themes or even 
rhetorical strategies, but rather of the 
underlying assumptions about how 
lyrics will be interpreted. Even at his 
most ironic, Mick Jagger damn well 
expects to be taken seriously. He's 
invested a lot in his credibility. He 
writes his own songs, his band plays 
its own music. He's supposed to 
have earned the right to tell us what to 
think. The Village People, on the other 
hand, challenge their audience to 
laugh at them, and are ready in turn to 
laugh right back. Making no claims to 
authority, they tear everyone else's 
down. 

On a 
basic level of personal 
autonomy, 
disco has the 
advantage of letting you have your 
heroes and laugh at them too. Even as 
practical political arguments, disco's 
camp sensibility translates into a 
subversive power every bit as potent as 
rock earnestness. 

Protest 
songs, trapped by an obligation to 
mean something, signal their inten-
tions and can only preach to the 
converted or bounce off deaf ears. The 
only audience whose hearts and minds 
might actually be won are new fans, 
obliged by the rules of the game to buy 
into their heroes' politics. If you are a 
Bob Dylan 
fan, 
you're supposed 
to support his populist poli-
tics. 

Because 
disco 
never 
demands that we understand, it can 
hint at 
far 
more. 

Consider 
marvelously subversive "In the Navy," a 
paean to male bonding which the 
Navy actually attempted to buy as a 
recruitment jingle. I 
assume they 
didn't get the joke at fJISt, but they 
must have been let in on it eventually. 

Even if they never did, the point was 
already made for the world to see and 
giggle at- the American military 
stumbled upon a language it had 
refused to accept, admitting in the 
process that male bonding and 
gay sex are on more common 
ground than either the military or the 
Supreme Court would like to admit. 

3. Community: concert os. ~. 
You go to a Paul McCartney concert, 
and what are you expected to do? Stare 
up at the stage, or, more likely, at the

giant TV screen above. Sing along 
with the songs. Clap. Hold up your 
lighter at the end. This is the classic 
rock vision of community, one which, 
as rockers such as Pink Floyd have 
observed, places it in the company of 
such 
phenomena 
as 
fascist 
rallies- social bonding through 
uniform experience. In disco, on the 
other hand, every audience member 
invents the experience for him or 
herself. Since the fans are almost 
always dancing to an invisible pre-
recorded track, each participant's 
attention is focused on the other 
dancers. The disco community is 
united through diverse expressions of a 
common experience. 

The present is a fun place; more Yalies 
ought to visit it some time. But it 
might just be that every era needs a 
past to which it can cling. We don't 
have to free fall forever through the 
generation gap; 
we become 
tomorrow's yuppies, the advertisers 
might flatter us by idealizing the '70s. 
It's not like disco ever died; it just 
renamed itself Madonna. As hip-hop 
and house music propel us into the 90s, 
classic rock atavism is looking sillier 
and sillier. As we look for a new model 
for rock and roll, the Me Decade looks 
more like a golden age. Help speed the 
process along. Let's turn our tie-dyes 
into dust rags, pull out those white 
suits, and dance the night away.
