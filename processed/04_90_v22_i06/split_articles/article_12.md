scoffs at Panzarella's version of history .
"I can't recall seeing a member of 
SAAC at any CAA meetings that 
winter or spring," he said. 
"We didn't want to 
undermine genuine 
community outrage 
by announcing an 
empty threat." 
Morand said 
that community 
support was essential to the student 
protest. "The Administration can 
ignore the student voices, but when 
students and the community speak 
together, the University takes notice," 
he said. While the University has 
severely cut back on its investments in 
South Africa from over $300 million to 
$26 million today, the protesters never 
realized their goal for total Yale 
divestment. "Yale responds to the beck 
and call of the U.S. Governement and 
won't 
divest until the federal 
government does," said Paula 
Panzarella . 

In 
1987 
the Coal.ition 
Against 
Apartheid changed 1ts 
name to 
Students Against Apartheid, 
and 
announced that they would restrict 
their meetings to Yale students. "We 
needed to limit the protest to people 
who were in a position to demand 
something from Yale," Lucas said . 
Despite the changes in CAA, the two 
New Haven groups continued to 
squabble on campus. In February 
1989, SAAC and Yale's Black Law 
Students Association planned a forum 
featuring speakers from the African 
National Congress and other Southern 
African liberation groups. Promo-
tional posters for the event identified 
South Africa as Azania-an ancient 
name used by members of the Pan 
Africanist Congress. ANC speaker 


Ben Magubane suspected the forum's 
sponsors of ties with the PAC, a black 
nationalist group repudiated by the 
multi-racial ANC. According to 
Marder, Magubane saw the Coalition 
listed as an endorser of the event and 
called Marder to question the sponsor's 
politics. Marder said that SAAC never 
even asked the Coalition to endorse the 
forum. "The first I heard of the forum 
was when Magubane called me," he 
said. "I didn't know what he was 
talking about." 

Frank and Paula Panzarella claim 
Marder insinuated that SAAC 
supported the PAC . This allegation, 
the Panzarellas said, 
influenced 
Magubane's decision to withdraw from 
the forum . Other speakers followed 
suit, and the symposium never took 
place. In an AprillO, 1989letter to The 
New Haven Advocate, the Panzarellas 
denied any 'ties to the PAC and 
accused Marder of deliberately 
misleading Magubane. "Marder's ... 
sabotage of a significant opportunity 
for the people of New Haven to learn 
of southern Africa is the lowest depths 
we've seen of factionalizing in New 
Haven," they wrote. 

"We didn't think any 
one group should 
have a franchise on 
the anti-apartheid 
movement." 
Marder said he never discussed the 
SAAC's political affiliations with 
Magubane. "My only suggestion was 
that Magubane call SAAC directly," 
Marder said. "That was the last I heard 
of it until I was accused of all these 
nasty things." 

Since the forum fell apart last year, 
SAAC has been losing momentum. 
Now, confidence that apartheid is on 
the decline has tempered much of 
SAAC 's zeal for local protest. With the

during the heyday of Yale's anti-
apartheid movement. 
de Klerk regime's recent reforms, 
SAAC members hint that they may 
soon abdicate their role in the battle. 
"In many ways this struggle is for the 
South African people themselves to 
resolve," said Paula Panzarella. SAAC 
met only once this year, when they 
held a party to celebrate Nelson 
Mandela's release. 

Coalition 
members 
fear that 
progress in South Africa is overrated. 
"People think that they're on their way 
to freedom land," said Frank Carrano. 
"That's one of the dangers we have to 
guard against." Far from giving up the 
fight, the Coalition won't rest until the 
South African government abolishes 
apartheid. Pooling their resources with 
other groups, the Coalition has joined a 
Northeastern network of anti-
apartheid organizations. Pam Saffer, 
the Coalition's delegate to the 
North East South Africa Solidarity 
Network, said this organization allows 
groups from different cities to share 
information. 

As New 
Haven's 
anti-apartheid 
movement 
redefines 
itself, Joel 
Schiavone prepares for Connecticut's 
gubernatorial race. Schiavone doesn't 
think his past confrontations with the 
Coalition and SAAC will affect his bid 
for the Republican ticket. He antici-
pates that the only votes he will lose are 
those that come from the far left. "I 
wouldn't have gotten 
those votes 
anyway," he said.
