A Movement Divided 
Laura Bradford 
AI Marder and fellow members of the 
New Haven Free South Africa 
Coalition went to the Palace Theater to 
denounce 
real 
estate 
mogul Joel 
Schiavone. 
They 
left 
lambasting not only Schiavone, the 
theater's owner, but also the South 
African Action Â·Committee, another 
anti-apartheid organization. Both 
groups came to the Palace on August 
30, 1987 to protest Schiavone's plans to 
vacation in South Africa with the 
Young President's Organization, a 
group of high ranking businessmen. 
The YPO planned to gamble in Sun 
City, meet with then Prime Minister 
P . W. Botha, and shop at the South 
African diamond mines. After private 
meetings with Schiavone had .failed to 
convince him to change his plans, 
Coalition 
members decided 
to 
demand publically that he cancel his 
trip. 

While Marder and other 
Coalition members spoke 
into 
a 
microphone in front of the Palace, 
SAAC activists weaved through the 
crowd, encouraging people to boycott 
the theater. 
Marder, 
committed 
to private 
negotiation and 
public statement, 
thought the SAAC boycott caused 
more harm than good. "A boycott of 
the Palace was an idea that the 
Coalition had already rejected," 
Marder said. He emphasized that 
boycotts depend on large amounts of 
effort and organization. "We didn't 
want to undermine genuine commu-
nity outrage by announcing an empty 
threat." SAAC member Frank 
Panzarella thought the Coalition 
would never get anywhere with their 
approach. A boycott, he thought, 
might do the trick. "Anything that 
deals a blow to the pocketbook of the 
person you're targeting is effective," 
said Panzarella. 

In spite of the hubbub, Schiavone 
journeyed to South Africa as planned 
in October, 1987. "A lot of what you 
hear about conditions in South Africa

is just nonsense," he said. "The New 
Haven protest was staged by a bunch 
of crazy people to express their own 
self-righteousness." 

Marder blames the SAAC for mud-
dling efforts 
to stop Schiavone. 
Because SAAC publicized their plans 
at the Coalition's Palace press 
conference, many people assumed that 
Marder's group also supported the 
boycott. Representatives from non-
profit organizations like Columbus 
House and the Connecticut Food 
Bank, which held fund raisers in the 
theater rent-free, called the Coalition 
wondering if they should cancel their 
events. 

Although the boycott never won 
widespread support, Panzarella said it 
was valuable as a symbolic gesture. 
J ust prior to Schiavone's departure, the 
Board of Aldermen made a symbolic 
gesture of its own. The Board named 
the intersection of College and Chapel 
streets "Bishop Tutu Corner." The 
crossing overlooks much of Schiavone's 
property. 

The Schiavone incident typifies the 
rift between the Coalition and SAAC. 
On a crusade for the same cause, the 
two groups employ different tactics. 
Rather than advancing their common 
goals, they often have resorted to 
antagonism and backbiting. With the 
recent developments in South Africa, 
both groups struggle to define their 
present role in local efforts. 

The New Haven anti-apartheid 
movement started in the fall of 1984 
with the formation of the Coalition. 
When the South African government 
jailed eleven union organizers, New 
Haven labor leaders Frank Carrano 
and Andrea Cole coordinated a local 
response. "We initiated a support 
movement within the New Haven 
labor groups to show our solidarity 
from halfway across the world," said 
Carrano. At the first meeting of the 
Coalition, 25 people representing 
several organizations, including the 
NAACP and the Downtown Co-op 
Ministry, launched a campaign calling 
for 
New 
Haven 
to divest 
from 
companies with holdings in South 
Africa. 


Coalition members took up nego-
-tiation as their primary strategy right 
from the beginning. Since the city uses 
retirement funds for its principal 
investments, the Coalition set out to 
convince N ew R aven's pension boards 
that divestment would be a fiscally 
responsible move. If New Raven's 
legislators would agree to divest, the 
Coalition argued, 
the 
city could 
actually increase 
revenue 
by re-
inve sting 
m 
more profitab le 
companies. 

While the Coalition lobbied behind 
closed doors, Panzarella, his wife 
Paula and several friends founded the 
South African Action Committee. "We 
were impatient with the Coalition's 
quiet process of negotiation," said 
Frank P anzarella. T he newly formed 
group wanted more public agitation 
against apartheid. "We didn't think 
any one group should have a franchise 
on the anti-apartheid movement," said 
Paula Panzarella. 

"A lot of what you hear 
about conditions in 
South Mrica is just 
nonsense." 

While SAAC shared the Coalition's 
commitment to divestment, Com-
mittee members opted for a more 
~assroots approach. They began 
distributing leaflets to city employees 
urging them to support divestment. 
Aubrey W illiams, a New Haven fire-
fighter, learned a thing or two about 
New Raven's 
fmances. "Until 
leaflets came out, we were unaware 
that our money was going to South 
Africa," Williams said. When the city's 
pension boards finally voted to divest 
all its funds in August 1985, both th_e 
SAAC and the Coalition took credtt

for the victory. T he Panzarellas claim 
that their leafletting cam paign amassed 
the needed support for divestment. 
Coalition members maintain that the 
broad constituency they mobilized in 
favor of divestment carried the day. 

Spurred by the New Haven divest-
ment campaign and searching for a 
new focal point, the SAAC tried to 
shape Yale's emerging anti-apartheid 
movement. "Yale students were still 
involved in discussion and education," 
Paula Panzarella said. "They d idn't 
know how to organize an effective 
protest." She thought they could forge 
a relationship that would prove vital in 
tackling the Yale Corporation. 

While the Coalition also supported 
fledgling studen t 
movem ent, 
M arder felt SAAC's hands-on tactic 
was inappropriate. "Yale students had 
the primary responsibility to organize 
their own efforts," he said . "In a sense 
they are a village within our city and 
their leadership had to come from the 
Yale community." Although willing to 
assist student 
projects, 
members stressed the separateness of 
two groups. 
W hen students 
decided to build shanties in Beinecke 
Plaza, the Coalition helped them with 
carpentry. Still, according to Marder, 
the success of the campus divestment 
movement rested with the students. 

During the spring of 1986, the 
student protesters 
g rabbed 
attention of the entire city. They 
staged numerous rallies, clashe? with 
local police and blockaded port1ons of 
the campus. The student body joined 
the Yale Coalition Against Apartheid 
in demanding that the University sell 
its $300 m illion of South African 
assets. 

SAAC claim s they radicalized the 
student m ovemen t. "Studen ts were just 
beginning to realize the importance of 
public 
involvement," said 
Frank 
Pan zarella. 
H e 
points to SAAC's 
picketing 
of then 
P resident 
Bart 
G iamatti's house in October 1985 as 
the seminal event in the student 
movement's maturation. 

Panzarella 
claims the students needed SAAC to 
n udge 
them 
in to 
act1v1ty. 
"The 
students were waffling," he said. "They 
weren't sure if they really wanted to go 
over the edge with the struggle." 

According to Panzarella, SAAC took 
CAA under its wing and gave the 
students confidence to build the 
shan ties on Beinecke Plaza. Al Lucas 
{BR '90), a member of CAA, said 
SAAC takes too much of the credit. 
"T hey did n't originate the idea for the 
shanties," h e 
said .
