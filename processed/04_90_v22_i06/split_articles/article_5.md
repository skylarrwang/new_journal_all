Three years ago, Dan Gerwin OE '90) 
and Ami Kleinman (DC '90) dined in 
the Kosher Kitchen each week with four 
other students. Gerwin had recruited 
them to revive a dying orga~ization, 
Yale Student Friends of Israel. Under 
Gerwin's leadership, the resurrected 
YSFI became a social group devoted to 
learning more about Israel. YSFI 
forwarded neither a stated manifesto 
nor a 
political consensus, and 
members ranged from the far right to 
the far left. They argued about Israeli 
cinema, passed around back issues of 
The Jerusalem Post, and chatted in 
Hebrew. 

In December 1987, the Intifadah, 
Palestinian 
upnsmgs against the 
Israelis in the Occupied Territories, 
began and YSFI's non-political days 
ended. Though the group still made 
falafel and danced to Israeli music, 
unrest on the West Bank became a 
major topic of conversation. The 
discussion attracted new members, 
and today the group boasts thirty 
participants. 

Kleinman explained the changes in 
the group. "When there's an opposing 
force, you have to start dealing with 
more political issues," he said. The 
Coalition for Palestinian Rights 
represented such a force. Concerned 
by Israeli treatment of Palestinian 
settlers, Mario Kashou (BR '91) and 
~David Ranz (BR '91) founded CPR in 
l the fall of 1988. "We wanted to educate 
: the Yale community about what's been 
'i happening in the West Bank. People 
§ shouldn't take one medium or one 
~ voice as the truth," said Christina 
~ Erickson (DC '92), CPR's current 
president. This year, five core members 
attend CPR meetings regularly. 

Unlike YSFI, CPR has a clear poli-
tical agenda. In this year's edition of 
The Yale, CPR defines itself as a human 
rights group advocating a two-state 
solution in the Occupied Territories. 
"We hope to educate the average 
American voter," Erickson said. 

Over the past year YSFI and CPR 
have tried to get their messages out. 
This spring, CPR is holding three 
panel discussions on Arab-Israeli 
relations. Three weeks ago, YSFI 
screened A Search For Solid Ground, a 
television program about Israeli 
perspectives on the Intifadah. A CPR 
forum 
on March 
29th drew 
a 
smattering of middle-aged adults and 
some members from both groups, but 
few other students showed up. The 
turnout was typical for both CPR and 
YSFI events. 

YSFI and CPR rely on table tents 
for their real interaction with the Yale 
campus. Though both groups contend 
they do not necessarily oppose each · 
other, the aggressiv¢ tones of the table · 
tents might belie this assertion. One 
YSFI table tent blames Palestinian 
Liberation Organization leader Yasir 
Arafat for condoning the Tiananmen 
massacre. A CPR table tent rhetori-
cally asks "who fears our careful 
documentation of the Israeli army's 
human rights abuses?" 

Gerwin, who quit the group he helped 
found, is displeased with YSFI's table 
tent tactics. "CPR tries to discredit Israel 
andYSFI tries to discredit the PLO," he 
said. "It looks fairly childish." After 
attending a YSFI meeting last fall, 
Gerwin went away feeling disgusted. 
"People were 
incredibly angry, 
defensive, and reactionary. Defending 
Israel was not what we were about. 
YSFI is not a branch of the Israeli 
army." Gerwin 
even 
dislikes 
the 
group's name, which he believes has 
contributed to the group's political 
orientation. "I think YSFI is a cheesy 
name." 

Other YSFI members say that 
publi- opinion on Israel forced the 
group to change. "The political aspect 
was brought about by the negative 
propaganda," said Sam Schwartz (TC 
'91 ), YSFI's current president. Still, 
Schwartz denies that YSFI is fighting a 
table tent war. "Last year CPR pub-
lished a number of table tents which we 
found offensive," he said. "Our policy 
is that we don't respond to the table 
tents CPR puts out. It's not worth our -
while to respond to slanders which we 
don't even 
find 
constructive." 

Kleinman believes that YSFI, even in 
its earliest days, was actively prq-
Israel. "YSFI is doing now what I think 
is a major, if unspoken, part of the 
charter." 

CPR also denies that they are 
engaged in a battle of table tents. 
Group members consider themselves 
both pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian. 
"Criticizing Israel does not mean that 
you hate Jews or hate Israel. It just 
means that you are opposed to some of 
Israel's policies," states Jeff Finkelstein 
(MC '92), a CPR member. "I'm not an 
anti-Zionist. 
I 
support 
Israel's 
existence," he said. "But it's founded on 
the ideal to save a people from perse-
cution, not to persecute other people." 

Many members of YSFI aJ;~;ree with 
Finkelstein. Though some YSFI mem-
bers wholeheartedly support Israeli 
policies, others are Peace Now activists 
in favor of dialogue with the PLO. Still 
others think the Israeli electoral system 
should be overhauled. With so many 
disparate voices, it is difficult for YSFI 
to get its members to agree on a 
political message. A YSFI table tent 
needs to receive majority approval 
before it is distributed, but it is not 
representative of the entire group. 

"The majority of what YSFI has done 
this semester has been putting out 
political table tents," said Jason 
Glasgow (PC '90), president of YSFI 
last year. "People aren't exactly happy 
with that. A lot of table tents haven't 
been particularly productive at all." 

As the Intifadah wears on, YSFI 
struggles to define its role on campus. 
The tension between varying political 
agendas within the group begs the 
question, "Can you have your falafel 
and eat it too?"
