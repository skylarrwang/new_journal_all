sheepishly met senior resident Dr.
Craig Clark, Dr. Chen, and interns
Nicole Moayeri and Kurt Johnson. As
an extern I was to "run with the team"
whenever I wasn't with my sponsor,
Dr. Apuzzo ("Dr. A"). This meant that
I accompanied them on rounds, in
conference and in surgery. In my
scrubs and white coat I looked like part
of the team, and by the end of the week
some of the nurses greeted me with
"Hello, doctor." I couldn't bring myself
to admit that the title was still five
years away for me, that I knew about
the evolution of annelids but couldn't
give an injection to a patient.


In the wards there were patients
with conditions ranging from just-out-
of-ICU to ready-to-go-home. One
woman, who padded around in foam
slippers and a turban to cover her
shaved head, was ready to move to a
rehabilitation center after her
aneurism surgery. Dr. Moayeri and a
social worker were trying to find a
place for her, but she was an illegal
immigrant and almost no center could
or would accept her. Another patient,
Robert, talked only to me. I stopped
by his bed when the team moved on
and asked him how he was. He always
gave a surly "Okay," but it was a
triumph I had all to myself. Joe walked
through the wards and combed his hair
using shaving cream and looked
around with wide, crazed eyes. After
being threatened with surgery, he
began to improve rapidly. He liked to
play with words: "USC me-di-cal
center.
USC ma-ra-thon
center ... "


I met Dr. A , and we spent that
afternoon at his clinic. Unlike the
people at the county hospital, the men
and women
we saw here were
outpatients. Some of them would
eventually need surgery, some would
undergo radiotherapy, and still others
were continually monitored for
progress. In the examining room, each
pauent sat on a table while Dr. A sat
on a stool at the patient's knees. He
spoke in an earnest and entreating
voice that turned easily and often to
laughter. "Tell me about your job,
your kids, your new car" blended in
with "tell me about your back or your
headache." "If this much pain right
here is a dollar," he said to Sam, who
declared that he liked cities where he
made "tons-a-dough," "how much is it
down here?" He told Linda that she
needed a second surgery. She asked
whether her head had to be shaved
again. "' hate to look at myself when
all there is on me is a face," she said.
Dr. A comforted her. "It will grow
back beautifully. but look at me. rm
losing my hair-permanently," he
said.


Once back in his office, Dr. A
became serious. He once burst out,
"That thing is sitting in her head, she
could die if it acts up. We gotta do
something quick." I imagined it was
quite an ego trip to see someone on the
verge of death and, godlike, to give
that person life. But Dr. A believes
that happiness for a physician doesn't
come from a sense of power. "The
superiority act gets tiring after awhile.
You have to remember that the doctor
is the handmaiden of the patient, and
never the other way around."


That night I accompanied Dr. Scott
Litofsky on all-night call. We saw a
woman whom the police had found
unconscious on the road. The flesh on
the back of her head was torn and
craniospinal fluid from her brain
drained out of her ear. She couldn't tell
us her name, so the orderlies gave her
one-"Mary 35." The 35 represented
her approximate age. The cuts and
bruises on her abdomen and inner
thighs were the marks of sexual
assault. While Dr. Litofsky examined
her, she struggled in an effort to escape
from the restraints that kept her on the
hospital bed. I could do nothing but
feel useless in the medical costume I
wore. At Yale, I had been an excited
freshman but spent sophomore year
cursing organic chemistry and most of
last semester complaining about
physics. Why the hell? I often asked
myself. Standing with fists clenched on
the rail of ~ary 35's bed, I was
ashamed at how easily I had lost sight
of my goal over a benign problem set
or two.
