Last spring the Arthur M. Rosenberg 
Company held a massive sale before 
closing its doors for the last time. Mter 
seventy years of selling preppy suits 
and ties, the clothier on the corner of 
York and Elm streets finally went out 
of business. "I felt like they were here 
forever," said Beverly Eliasoph, owner 
of the Guilford Trading Company. 

Today, advertisements from Eliasoph's 
shop, Graham Travel, Karen Alexis 
and the Daily Caffe dress the large 
wmdows where Rosenberg once d is-
played khaki pants and blue blazers. 
Impact M anagement, which handles 
leasing 
for 
this Yale-owned 
building, provides free advertising 
space for these four merchants, all of 
whom rent property from the Univer-
sity. According to the Yale Real Estate 
Office, Impact will offer the windows 
for promotional purposes until a new 
tenant moves into the Rosenberg 
building. 

Because the four businesses do not 
get the commercial traffic that stores 
on Chapel Street and Broadway enjoy, 
the Rosenberg building gives the 
advertisers added visibility. Eliasoph 
called the corner "a perfect location," 
and said that the displays helped boost 
Christmastime sales. Barry Cobden, 
owner of 
Boola 
Boola, 
Campus 
Clothing, and Cobden's General Store, 
who does not rent shop space from 
Yale, thinks be m issed out on a good 
chance to advertise. "We certamJy 
would have welcomed the advertising 
opportunity," be said. "We like to feel 
we are part of the Yale community." 

Impact M anagement hopes to find a 
tenant to take over the building soon. 
Other area merchants wonder why the 
property has remained empty for so 
long. â€¢It's a shame to leave it empty," 
said Chuck Caldwell, owner of T he 
Game. "It's not helping the community 
any." 

Karen Alexis, owner of the Park 
Street store which bears her name, is 
not surprised that Impact Manage-
ment cannot find a new occupant. "It 
seems to me that Yale has a lot of 
empty commercial spaces," she said. 
Alexis pointed out that the University-
owned space next door to her store, 
vacated in J anuary, still has no tenant. 
She suggested that property owned by 
Yale 
is 
no 
longer attractive to 
prospective renters. "People don't want 
to do business in downtown New 
H aven," she said. "It's not safe for me 
to be here in my store alone. A lot of 
my better customers from out of town 
are afraid to come to New H aven." 

Alexis holds Yale responsible. "Yale 
does not contribute to safety on New 
H aven's streets or help to create 
com mercial business," she said. Alexis 
plans to move out of New Haven soon. 

Beth Judd, associate director of 
Impact Management, is unsure how 
much longer the large blue "Arthur M. 
Rosenberg" sign will bang outside the 
building that the clothier vacated last 
year. "The building will be occupied as 
soon as the right tenant is found," said 
Judd. In the meantime, the Rosenberg 
building remains the most elaborate 
billboard in New Haven.
