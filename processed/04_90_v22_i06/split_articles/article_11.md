The elevator just would not come.
Dragging my "YALE U" backpack and my indestructible tan Samsonite. I climbed five flights of stairs to the Intensive Care Unit. I know I broke ICU etiquette, because the nurses stared at me in amazed silence. "This is the neurosurgery department at the Los Angeles County/University of Southern California hospital," their looks seemed to say, "Don't you think you'd be better off in a resort hotel?" I stammered that I was there for an externship with Dr. Michael Apuzzo (TD '61). Finally the nurses decided to page Dr. Tom Chen, the junior resident on call. When he came to meet me, he noticed my bags and decided that I should unpack first. I was thankful to get my embarrassing luggage out of there.

In the residents' dorm, I put my suitcase on the bed, donned a white coat and scrub clothes, and followed Dr. Chen to the Emergency Room.
The Sunday evening news droned from the TV in the waiting area outside the ER door. "Nonetheless, the spraying of crops, for now . . . will go . . . on," the anchorman announced dramatically.


Nobody paid any attention. We entered one of the cubicles used as a temporary holding area to see Estella, who had suffered a gunshot wound. Tom showed me where the bullet had entered the left side of her neck and had come out near her right shoulder. Her head was taped to the board beneath her, but her eyes followed us wildly. "Her spinal cord is OK," Tom told me, "but some of her vertebrae have been shattered. The question is whether she will be able to support her head or not."

"She needs X-rays," Dr. Chen told her husband, "we'll need to bend her neck away from her chest and then toward it." The husband played with the pink and blue fake feathers on his white straw hat as he spoke to her in Spanish; her eyes rolled, trying to find where he stood.


He put out a trembling hand to touch her hair, then cleaned off some of her smeared make-up. Dr. Chen called me over to help him, and I noticed that my hand was pressed protectively against my own neck. We had to force Estella's shoulders down so that the X-ray could get a clear picture. She had been quiet all that time. But she screamed then.

The X-rays showed that her vertebrae could still support her neck. She would wear a soft neck brace and go home in a week. "Bueno," Tom told her with an encouraging smile, but she didn't seem to believe him. Tom went to finish her paperwork, and her husband informed me, "She wanna peeess."

Peace? Yes, I could understand. "You know, shit, PISS!" he repeated. Startled into speech, I said that I couldn't speak Spanish, only to realize that he had addressed me in English. At that, the husband took his quest elsewhere.


The LAC/USC medical center is a large county hospital in East Los Angeles. Most of the soap opera-watching population would recognize it as the building in Genua[ Hospital. LAC/USC primarily serves patients without insurance, and the city and county absorb much of the costs. Anyone who attended public high school knows the look and feel of the place: long hallways, two-tone walls, the tired fluorescent lights and the smell of paint (all that painting and repainting). The nurses' stations in the wards are hulking and painted; nothing like the sleek wood-grain stations found in posher clinics.

Monday morning I arrived two hours late for 7 A.M. rounds, and
