**Yale Recycling: From Barrels to Budget**

In 1981 two Yale Law School students
decided that the University should
begin recycling its wastepaper. Their
entire operation consisted of eight
barrels, an old station wagon and no
money. A handful of students spent
their afternoons emptying the barrels
and
then hauling paper off to
the Hershman Recycling Company in
New Haven. Although none of these
pioneer recyclers earned a salary,
everyone involved in the project took
home what
they called "psychic
income." Today, 41 students make
daily runs to 80 spots on campus in a
Chevrolet flatbed truck and collect
wastepaper which they deliver to
dumpsters behind Ingalls Rink. The
operation is more sophisticated now;
the student collectors earn wages from
the Employment Office and the Strat-
ford Bailing Company picks up the
paper from the dumpsters twice a
month.


Yale Recycling currently
receives some money from the Uni-
versity on a
need basis, but the
administration has grown increasingly
eager to fund Yale Recycling. This
September, recycling will appear on
the University's official budget for the
first time.
By funding Yale Recycling, the
administration plans to relieve the
student group of some of the manage-
ment and labor involved in the
process. Last February, in an effort to
streamline the program, the Facilities
Management Office hired Cyril John
May (FES '89) as Yale's first Recycling
Coordinator. May, who worked with
Yale Recycling as a graduate student,
will help make the recycling system
run more efficiently.


The student-run organization will
still empty some of the wastepaper
barrels and take responsibility for most
of the campus educational programs.
But according to May, starting this
summer custodial and physical plant
workers will take over most of the
collection runs as part of their regular
job duties. "Ultimately we'd like to get
the custodial service doing most of the
regular pick-ups," he said.


May
stressed that the budget for recycling
will remain fairly tight, however, and
the administration does not plan to
hire new workers for the pick-ups.
"We're still trying to work a lot of this
out," said May. "Yale has never had a
program like this so it's hard to say
what the final results are going to be."


The University is taking over a pro-
gram that manages to recycle roughly
130 tons of newspaper and office paper
each year. Yet this figure represents
only 17 percent of all the recyclable
paper thrown out by Yalies and a mere
2 percent of the University's entire
wastestream,
which includes cans,
bottles and all material shipped to a
landfill for disposal. "We should be
doing better," said Adam Davis (BR
'90), current head of Yale Recycling.

The state of Connecticut agrees.
Legislators have mandated that by the
end of 1990, all municipalities in the
state must reduce the garbage going
into the landfills by 30 percent.
Lawmakers have drawn up a list of
nine types of recyclable waste- inclu-
ding cardboard, office white paper,
newspaper and glass- which landfills
cannot accept after this year.


Both Davis and May suggest that
this statewide legislation has influenced
Yale's decision to put recycling on the
University's budget. But Alan Braun,
director of Facility Management,
worries that Yale will probably not
reach the 30 percent waste-reduction
goal by the end of the year. Yale
generates an intimidating amount of

garbage. Each year Yale ships 6,000
tons of waste off the campus and in
that time the University goes through
15 tons of Post-It notes alone. Even
with a recycling program to help reduce
the wastestream, Yale's entire garbage
output has actually risen since the
program began in 1981.


Since the University still depends on
landfills for much of its garbage
disposal, New Haven's landfill crisis
has forced Yale to look elsewhere. The
city government planned to close the
overflowing New Haven dump three
months ago, but extended its term of
operation because of the absence of
