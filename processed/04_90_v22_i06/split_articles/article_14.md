This Woman's Work 
Is Never Done 
Amy Waldman 
Elga Wasserman helps women find 
rooms of their own. Although it is 
tricky work, she has had twenty years 
of practice. As a special assistant to Yale 
President Kingman Brewster from 
1969 to 1972, she persuaded Yale men 
to double up so'that women could have 
a place in the 'dorms. 
~he shielded 
Yale's 
first 
female 
undergraduates 
from media scrutiny, ensured that the 
Department of University Health 
provided gynecological services and 
convinced gymnasium officials to open 
locker rooms for the women. Today 
she practices family law down the 
street from the Yale campus in a small 
comfortable office on Orange Street. 
"She was one of the pioneers in gaining 
an acceptance of women in family 
law," said jim Greenfield, a fellow New 
Haven attorney. 

Wasserman's colleagues regard her 
as a persuasive courtroom advocate. 
Greenfield remembers arguing against 
her in a divorce case. "She absolutely 
buried me," he said. As a divorce 
lawyer, Wasserman often represents 
women who have sacrificed their 
individuality for their families. "Unlike 
me," she said, 
"they devoted their 
entire lives to their husband's career 
and to their children." Wasserman 
helps these women recover a degree of 
independence. "I'm probably doing 
more for women as a divorce lawyer 
than I could anywhere else," she said. 

Wasserman began her working life 
as a chemist. She always thought she 
could balance married life and her 
career, but her colleagues felt

differently. 
She remembers their 
reaction when she announced her 
plans to wed ~ ' "People assumed," she 
said, "that I was lost to the cause of 
science." Her husband's job would 
determine her career path, colleagues 
warned. To some degree, they were 
right. 
Wasserman 
followed 
her 
husband to New Haven when he found 
a job at Yale, but she did not apply for 
a faculty position here. No women 
taught at the undergraduate level 
during the 
early 
postwar years. 
Instead, she worked full time as a 
research assistant in microbiology until 
the birth of her first child. For the next 
ten years, she worked part time in 
education and industry. 

In 1959, Wasserman returned to the 
lab. But she was soon overwhelmed by 
the competing demands of career and 
family. "I didn't think I could really be 
a first rate scientist and do justice by 
my family. Being a second rate scien-
tist didn't appeal to me," she said. She 
taught chemistry at the University of 
Southern Connecticut for a year and 
then accepted an assistant deanship in 
the sciences at Yale. For six years she 
administered grant and fellowship 
money. 

When Brewster decided to admit 
women to Yale College, he created the 
position of special assistant to the 
president 
on 
co-education. 
"Wasserman was the perfect choice," 
said Sam Chauncey, then a special 
assistant 
to 
President Brewster. 
Wassserman noted wryly that. she was 
an obvious choice. "I was one of very 
few female administrators around," she 
said. Originally, Brew~ter designated 
Trumbull College as the women's 
college, with Wasserman as Master. 
But Trumbull students protested, and 
although Wasserman argued tha,t the 
women should live in one college, the 
adminstration ultimately placed them 
in all twelve colleges. 

Chauncey and Wasserman selected 
independent and resilient women for 
Yale's first co-ed class. Once the 
women arrived, Wasserman met with 
women from all twelve colleges each 
week. 
When custodial workers 
installed full-length mirrors in all the 
women's rooms, 
studeniS 
complained that men were telling the 
women what they needed. Wassermatl 
also contended with administrato11

concessions for women. She battled for

library at night. 

Wasserman's phone rang off the 
hook 
with 
calls 
from 
confused 
administrators. ·she remembers one 
dean who called her because a female 
student was dating a music teacher at 
another college. The dean wanted to 
know if he should call her parents. 
"Would he ever have called me if it were 
a male student?" Wasserman wonders. 
Another asked her in exasperation 
"Elga, what do you women want? 
Don't you realize that you are the ones 
who have the babies?" 

Barbara Deinhardt, a member of the 
class of 1973 who worked in the Office 
of the Education of Women with 
Wasserman, remembers that she was 
always "solidly supportive" of the 
women . 
Deinhardt 
assisted 
W~sserman in assembling a publi-
cauon called "She," a directory of 
women's services, resources and female 
faculty members. Nevertheless, for 
many of the women, Wasserman 
remained an untapped resource. 
"Many of us didn't perceive the kinds 
of dif!iculties we were having," said 
Assoc1ate Professor of English Susanne 
Wofford, also a member of the first 
class of women. "We didn't perceive 
the importance of Yale having 
someone like her available to talk to." 

After that first year, Wasserman 
devoted her efforts to increasing the 
number of female faculty and students 
at ~ale. She also pushed for affirmative 
action. 
From 1970 to 1972, she 
traveled around the country speaking 
to alumni groups, reassuring them that 
"nothing terrible was going to happen 
because Yale had admitted women." 
One of the alumni groups cancelled 
her speaking engagement because it 
met in a building that would not allow 
women inside. On the whole, however, 
Wasserman found that the alumni 
welcomed women to Yale. 

By 1972, after three intense years in 
the spotlight, Wasserman felt burnt 
out, and she took a leave of absence 
from Yale. "She went through a 
process of becoming more and more 
cynical," said Deinhardt. "She became 
increasingly frustrated by the admini-
stration's lack of commitment to 
equalizing the experience of women at 
Yale." Before she left the University, 
Wasserman demanded that Yale hire 
and admit more women. "Everything 
else 
was 
irrelevant," she said. 

Wasserman remains dissatisfied with 
the continuing lack of role models for 
young women, and asks, "How can a 
woman student aspire to become a 
professor when every professor she has 
is male?" 
"Eventually Wasserman thought she 
would be able to make more of a 
difference elsewhere," Deinhardt said. 
Wasserman left Yale in 1972 and 
began to explore some of her own 
interests. She spent a few months 
conducting a 
study of female 
academics in foreign countries, 
inspired by her observation that a 
disproportionately high number of 
women in American universities were 
foreign born. Wasserman concluded 
that in the U.S., these women felt 
free of binding cultural norms. "They 
were pulled out of their own cultures," 
Wasserman observed, "so they could 
do what they wanted." Wasserman 
herself came to America from another 
country. Born in Germany, she fled 
Nazi oppression when she was only 
twelve.

moved on 
to the 
Carnegie Commission on Children, 
where she studied the need for daycare 
in a society with increasing numbers of 
double-income families. The daycare 
issue continues to upset Wasserman 
today. She points out that Yale still 
lacks adequate childcare facilities for 
its faculty and employees. As a mother 
with a career, Wasserman often felt 
guilty leaving her children to go to work. 
"When I was still a rarity working, 
"We're giving lip 
service to equality but 
people aren't willing to 
accept it." 
whatever went wrong with the kids 
would be blamed on the fact that I had 
a career," she said. 

Even when a man tries to adapt his 
lifestyle to relieve some of these 
pressures on his wife, he often faces 
public criticism. Wasserman believes 
that condemning President Benno 
Schmidt and his wife, Helen Whitney, 
for not spending enough time on 
campus, reveals a double standard. 
"We're giving lip service to equality but 
people aren't willing to accept it," she 
said. 

Wasserman complains that 
society expects too much of career 
women. "You're supposed to exercise 
and relax and socialize and read and 
pay attention to your kids and your job 
and your appearance and your teeth 
and the news- how can you do all 
that?" Though Wasserman seems to 
have mastered the juggling act herself, 
she suggests that women can onlY 
achieve true equality by dropping 
some of the balls .
