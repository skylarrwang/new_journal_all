yet administrative assistants in eight out of 
12 colleges had never heard of it.. June 
Ellen Sullivan in Timothy Dwight 
College and Alicia Baker in Trumball 
College both remembered the flyers 
but couldn't find them. "I threw them 
out months ago," said Sullivan. "No 
one ever took them." 

Zimmerman, Professor McCarthy 
and Malinowski remain optimistic that 
the program will catch on in time. 
Malinowski, who commits forty hours 
per week to other extracurricular 
activities, hopes that writing letters to 
freshmen counselors and to College 
Masters this summer will help promote 
the program. "I'm sick of the admini-
strative bullshit. I just want to do 
mediations." McCarthy thinks Yalies are 
too accustomed to ignoring problems 
or going to a decisive authority to settle 
them. "It's not very often you're offered 
this sort of remedy. It takes a while to 
generate an appetite." 

Malinowksi is confident that medi-
ation can work, both at Yale and in the 
larger legal 
picture. "If there's 
something that's bothering two 
people," he asked, "why not try to 
resolve it? If it works, and it does a lot 
of the time, they'll leave the mediation 
with a much better relationship." 

Zimmerman hopes mediation will curb 
the frequency of lengthy and expensive 
litigation. "Often people escalate a 
conflict just so it becomes 'valid' 
enough to bring it to court." Last year, 
the American Bar Association created 
a new division solely for mediation and 
lawyers nationwide have established 
private mediation practices. "Medi-
ation is really taking off," Malinowski 
said. But at Yale, Zimmerman and 
!"falinowski are having trouble getting 
It off the ground.
