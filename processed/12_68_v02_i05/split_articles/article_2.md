Last spring the finest English department in the country took some rough handling from the Course Critique. Teacups shook for a while in the Elizabethan Club, then sat firm; it was all a result, the keener saw, of SDS infiltrating the major. Nothing wrong with the program itself. And over the summer office space was expanded in HGS. But the shaking ought to go on for a while longer. The major does need thorough reforms and not merely rearrangement and relabeling of existing procedures.

This fall several faculty and student committees, with many words and some discussion, are attempting to plan changes. Perhaps a bill of complaints might be helpful.

1) The prerequisite has gone unquestioned for too long, as has the very idea of a prerequisite to literary studies.

2) The Medieval-Renaissance requirement (four terms from English 30--42) is a fragment from an earlier arrangement of the major.

3) Course offerings are restricted by early twentieth-century notions of important figures, period-divisions and genres.

4) The department treats creative writing as a retarded stepchild.

5) Students have no part in making up courses.

6) The departmental examination, mistakenly called "comprehensive" by faculty and students alike, is not only anti-educational but anti-literary (ask any victim of reading or writing one).

7) Apart from comps, the department has no way of distinguishing work in senior year from work in junior year. If the department commits itself to thorough reforms now, these complaints need never agitate the loveliest minds in the Class of '73.

Certain questions confront any department rethinking its major, but they are particularly thorny in this case because of the size of the English major at Yale. First, who is the major? Why did he choose this field? What bearing has his major on his future career? Obviously, there is no single answer. English majors go on to many professional schools, not just graduate study in literature. The major may become a high-school teacher, a politician, a publisher, any kind of businessman, someday even a housewife. Motives for studying English literature range from liking books to wanting to teach, from a need to create polished memoranda to a need to create the great American novel. To undergraduates English promises freedom from professional limitations and a diversity of character in the students it attracts. The department must consider carefully whether the present procedures of the major fully respect this freedom and diversity.

A second question continues from the first. What is the place of rules in a college major? How valuable is the uniformity of knowledge and experience that rules impose? The potential lawyer and the poet will not fit the same mold; Milton will be a curiosity to one, a brother and rival to the other. And since uniformity is most often a selective pattern, why have rules which require everyone to study Spenser and ignore Sterne, or to study Spenser at a particular time and in a particular way? If the department begins by thinking about the kinds of students in the major rather than the kind of major for the students, then the apparent importance of rules and uniformity will diminish. Rules will cease to work against the freedom and diversity which should distinguish the Yale English major.

To insure freedom and diversity in the major, the department could-

1) Eliminate English 25 as the sole prerequisite to the major. A prerequisite implies necessary fundamentals to be mastered before a student can begin his major. Yet English literature is not a hierarchical discipline. You learn as much going back from Eliot to Donne as you do going forward from Milton to Pope. The long narrative poem is not a prerequisite to drama or the novel. The student should be free to choose from a range of specified courses his own entrance into the English major. Instead of facing the confusing and invidious distinctions among English 15, 25, 29 and Literature I, he should use the prerequisite as a perspective, satisfying his own intellectual interests instead of an administrative requirement. And an awareness of various perspectives could temper the current view of literary history as a mere record of past dates and encourage students to consider the relations between historical ordering and other methods of ordering literature.

2) Eliminate the requirement that students take four term courses between English 30 and English 42. No matter how important the figures, works or periods, special protection of interest groups ruins liberal education. Julian Beck won't displace Shakespeare; and students would respect Milton as a poet of political action rather than as the last dusty celebrator of the Elizabethan World View. Most damaging of all, this particular requirement strongly suggests that the English department cherishes all literature over 250 years old. The suggestion is false and could easily be removed.

3) Offer courses new in form and substance. To read the course catalogue now is to trudge from one half-century to another, from the age of one big name to the age of the next. There is no reason, for example, why a course could not trace different literary treatments of madness in The Praise of Folly, Hamlet, Swift's Tale of a Tub, the Romantic poets, Celine's Journey to the End of Night. Such a course might easily explore relations between literature and psychology or between the methods of literary criticism and those of psychoanalytic interpretation. Or courses in literature and film. The English department does not leave Homer to the classics department. Why leave Griffith, Oliver, Kubrick and Warhol to the history of art department?

4) Offer more courses in creative writing and work to eliminate the distinction between creative expression and critical insight. Courses could combine creative and critical projects, to test awareness and control of language. Attempts to imitate prose styles or recreate poetic forms can produce as much insight as strictly critical studies. To staff these courses, the department need not diminish its commitment to scholarship in recognizing that literature has other professors than scholars. To renew its literary life, Yale needs more working poets and novelists.

5) Urge students to experiment with course structures. A student might earn double credit for special work on Pope in a general course on the 18th century. Or, while studying the Romantic poets, receive credit in the major for a history course on the French revolution or a philosophy course on German idealism. Or develop analogies between poetry and music,
