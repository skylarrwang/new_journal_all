EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
It was the fifth speaker, Professor 
Kenneth Mills of our department, who 
finally brought his listeners face to face 
with today's truly overwhelming revolutionary potentiality. The tall, soft-spoken 
native of Trinidad with his Oxford-honed 
accent lectured commandingly on "Revolution and the Third World"; there, if 
anywhere, it seemed obvious to me, are 
the potential "revolutionary subjects" of 
our century. In sharp contrast with the 
highly speculative nature of Krippen-
dorff's approach, Mills piled statistic upon 
statistic to demonstrate the present in-
eluctable structural dependence of the 
Third World on the "metropolitan" coun-
tries, regardless of anyone's good intentions or occasional altruism. Only by 
radically breaking through these international structures themselves, he concluded, could the citizens of these countries seriously alter the conditions of 
their lives and open up the possibility of 
their developing new and better forms 
of community than any that we now 
know. But the chance for repetition of 
the Cuban experience (which Mills 
deemed encouraging but not yet susceptible to a final judgment) depended in 
largest measure, he thought, on what 
revolutionary or counter-revolutionary 
developments the next few years bring 
in the United States. 

So we do have a potential importance 
after all, we who are not ourselves of the 
Third World and who anguish about our 
existential situations and our commitments and our very motives for "intellectualizing" the raw political and social 
realities that surround us. It is true that 
we have no right to this importance, 
which derives mostly from the simple 
fact, as brutal as any tale of atrocities 
committed in the name of revolution, that 
our country and Russia have by far the 
greatest military arsenal in history. But 
denial of the right cannot change the 
fact; therefore, it is up to us to wield whatever influence we can so that the arsenal 
will be used less and less against wretched, 
underprivileged peoples who are trying 
to burst the structural integuments that 
oppress them. And, in order to wield such 
influence wisely, it is well for us to have 
as clear a conceptual grasp as possible--
ranging from the most abstract considerations to all the concrete details with which 
Ken Mills deliberately inundated us--of 
the global society in which they and we 
participate. The possibilities of our success and theirs may not be very great; at 
least two questioners remarked to Mills 
that this lecture left them more pessimistic 
about future change than they had been 
before. But the lecturer himself did not 
find the situation hopeless, and he briefly 
held out the vision, so foreign to a skeptic 
like Miss Arendt, of the evolution of men 
and communities with new, more humane 
values, both in the Third World and, ultimately, in the metropolises as well.
