American Premiere of 
Edward Bond's 
SAVED 
Directed by 
Jeff Bleckner 
"SAVED is not for children, but it is for 
grown-ups, and grown-ups should have 
the courage to look at it; and if we do 
not find precisely the mirror held up to 
nature in which we can see ourselves, 
then at least we can experience the sac-
ramental catharsis of a very chastening 
look at the sort of ground we have pre-
pared for the next lot." 
Sir Laurence Olivier
