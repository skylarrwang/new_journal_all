Reflections on reflections 
on revolution 
by William Leon McBride 
A young, mini-skirted female graduate 
student challenged Professor Ekkehart 
Krippendorff during the question period 
that followed his lecture, raising the is:sue 
that haunts any student of revolution, 
reactionary, radical or in between. Why, 
she asked, was the Herr Professor stand-
ing in this musty SSS classroom, calmly 
commenting on alternative possibilities 
for revolutionary student movements be-
fore mostly like-minded people, instead 
of being out on some street or campus, 
confronting? ".The point," as Marx said 
in the Theses on Feuerbach, "is to change 
it." Or if one sincerely believes that change 
would be deleterious, the point is then 
to resist it. 

What was being said, however earnest-
ly, in a small Yale classroom at four on 
a Tuesday afternoon seemed unlikely to 
change very much. And this fact seemed 
to pose a dilemma that we-Krippendorff 
and I, the other speakers, the girl graduate 
student and everyone else involved in the 
special philosophy department lecture 
series on revolution-had to try to re-
solve. If, as an academic, one is busily en-
gaged in contemplating the eternal Forms 
or in analyzing the structure of the demo-
cratic process in Chicago between 1964 
and 1967, then there is no problem. But 
if one chooses to be a student of revolu-
tion, then isn't one ultimately impelled to 
commit oneself to act, either to change or 
to resist change? 

During the question period following 
my own presentation two weeks earlier, 
one of my more conservative senior col-
leagues delivered an impassioned defense 
of quiet, revolutionary social change 
wrought without fanfa.re. He condemned 
the theological type of reasoning, as he 
saw it, behind some questions I had raised 
concerning necessary attributes of genuine 
revolution, in the Marxist sense. I thought 
at the time, and stiJI think, that he failed 
to see how close I had been to agreeing 
with him about the sterility and meaning-
lessness of terms in which theoretical ar-
guments about revolution have often 
been couched by so-called Marxists. My 
lecture had been composed in such a way, 
I thought, as to bring this out. But basical-
ly, his feeling of antagonism towards my 
ideas (our personal relations are very 
amicable) was justified: beneath the fre-
quent sterility and meaninglessness of 
the locutions, I am convinced that there 
is something that matters very much. 

As a philosopher, though, perhaps I 
am condemned to trying to battle with 
locutions. A former student of mine in the 
audience (who had returned to Yale 
after a year's absence during which he 
had become "radicalized") answered my 
colleague better than I did or, given my 
position, ever could have. He simply 
pointed out that, for students in Prague 
or Chicago, to understand better the 
realities of their present-day society or 
the real possibilities for change was a 
matter of utmost significance. To them, 
at least, the suggestion that the whole 
affair might be meaningless could not be 
a serious or meaningful suggestion. 

William McBride, assistant professor of 
philosophy, is currently on a leave of ab-
sence writing a book on neo-Marxism. 

Still, I remain bothered by the am-
biguity of my personal existential posi-
tion: a lecturer on revolution, favorable 
to change but unable to admit that the 
popular model, "C'est La lutte finale," 
makes sense. My talk, the second in the 
series, was entitled "Revolution and the 
New Marxism," as a complement to my 
friend Shlomo Avineri's, introductory 
"Marx and Revolution." My idea was to 
consider some of the problems posed for 
independent-minded contemporary Marx-
ists-first by the conceptual absurdity of 
speaking of "the revolution" as if it had 
been or could be an instantaneous, de-
limitable Apocalypse, and sec.ondly by 
the historical reality of the betrayed 
Revolution which the Soviet Union to-
day seems to offer. 

I began by pointing to Eduard Bern-
stein as a model of the impasse into 
which superficial varieties of "revision-
ism" can lead, went on to survey some of 
my very disparate heroes (Lukacs, Bloch, 
Kolakowski, Sartre, Lefebvre, a few 
Yugoslavians and Herbert Marcuse) on 
the nco-Marxist scene, and ended by in-
troducing the issue of the "revolutionary 
subject" which the next speaker, Herr 
Krippendorff, was to discuss. At one point, 
I made a few remarks to the effect of our 
needing something like a conception of 
"permanent revolution," not exactly in 
the Trotskyite sense, but in a sense closer 
to what Mao Tse-Tung and some Yugo-
slav philosophers (an absurd combina-
tion!) have written about. But the largest 
section of my talk was devoted to pulling 
some emotive wings off revolutionary 
butterflies of the eschatological sort. 

Maybe this is the quintessential philoso-
phical move-the move towards under-
standing what is radical and violent, as well 
as what is established, as part of a totality, 
a system. If that is so, then in a community 
of genuine revolutionaries the philosopher 
would always be a subversive-! mean 
counter-revolutionary-figure. He would 
always be tracing historical precedents, 
comparing his own community to other 
communities, .systematically considering 
alternatives-in short, relativizing the 
community's sense of radical novelty and 
uniqueness. Perhaps our whole lecture 
series is a manifestation of this counter-
revolutionary subversiveness: a plot, may-
be a subconscious one, to analyze away 
all revolutionary elan under the guise of 
showing some sympathy for it. At least, 
it could be so interpreted, and this dis-
turbs me. 

If I felt an ambiguity in my own case, 
it seemed even more pronounced with 
two of our other speakers, Shlomo Avineri 
and Hannah Arendt. A vineri, who spent 
three semesters here at Yale as a very 
popular lecturer in the political science 
department, was passing through for a 
feV( days on his way back home to Jeru-
salem; he opened the series. Having once 
taught a joint course with him and having 
just reviewed his new book on Marx, I 
was not surprised by most of what be said, 
but I was again impressed, as always, by 
the persuasiveness of his scholarship.

His thesis about Marx and revolution 
was basically that Marx was not a revolu-
tionary in the voluntarist, Jacobin sense 
which has become so intimately asso-
ciated with Marxism because of Lenin. 
He pointed to a list of ten proposals made 
in the Communist Manifesto for immedi-
ate implementation; some of them, such 
as free public school education, seem 
anything but radical today. Interestingly 
enough, the immediate nationalization 
of all industry is deliberately not included 
among the demands. Then too, he re-
minded us, there are several passages-
in letters, in Capital and elsewhere--
where Marx clearly accepts the possibility 
of capitalism's self-destruction by non-
violent means (in the most advanced in-
dustrial nations, especially England). 

Also of great importance, to A vineri's 
way of thinking, was the whole question of 
Marx's credentials as a prophet. His 
letters show him continually expecting 
revolutions in places where they soon 
fizzled. When he finally did hit upon a 
possible combination of events which 
could precipitate the cataclysm in Russia, 
a remarkably accurate anticipation of 
what actually did happen in 1917, Marx 
was speaking of it as a likelihood in his 
own time, some forty years earlier. 

Where did all this leave us? Avineri 
found Marx's scheme admirable as a con-
ceptual model for fundamental social 
change. But he had severe doubts, as the 
last few pages of his book make even 
clearer, about the relevance of any con-
ceptual scheme to actual political events; 
the inadequacies of Marx's prophecies 
helped confirm him in these doubts. As 
for what was once known as "the country 
of the revolution," Avineri's position was 
unambiguous: the USSR is, he said, "in 
no way a socialist country." Having just 
returned a week earlier from my first, 
confusing, touristic week's visit there, I 
would have been somewhat more inclined 
to qualify this statement. But A vineri's 
skepticism about the Soviet Union's claims 
to revolutionary purity is essentially cor-
rect, no question about it. Indeed, if there 
was a single strong point of agreement 
among all the first five speakers in the 
series, it was this point. And the next 
speaker, Marcuse, is similarly skeptical: 
his Soviet Marxism is all about the other 
major one-dimensional society be!>ides 
our own, and official Moscow ideologists 
have returned the compliment by labeling 
him a "bourgeois Marxist." 

It seems to me that the rejection of 
the USSR as one's post-revolutionary 
societal model has serious consequences 
for anyone who wants to analyze revolu-
tion within anything like a contemporary 
frame of reference: unless one takes the 
dubious step of considering either China 
or Yugoslavia as closer to the ideal, one 
runs the risk of talking about future pos-
sibilities in a vacuum. In a way, that is 
exactly what some recent student activists 
(Mark Rudd, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Rudi 
Dutschke) have done; it has been a self-
conscious stance on their parts. 

Formulating a limited number of speci-
fic demands, they point out, makes a rev-
olutionary movement easier for the Estab-
lishment to contain: specific demands can 
be met, at least in part, and that will be the 
end of it. I can understand this as a tactic, 
but it clashes head-on with the philosophi-
cal tendency to make things specific and 
precise. A movement that refuses to 
specify its future goals is bound to be 
dismissed with labels of "utopianism" or 
"anarchism" or both. Unless, once again, 
one works out a new theory of permanent 
revolution. But, if we leave aside the emo-
tive contents of the words and the con-
trasting identities of the individuals who 
use them, is the hope for "permanent revo-
lution" conceptually very different from 
the old Enlightenment dream of "con-
tinual progress?" 

This, I thought, was the most interest-
jog and disturbingly pessimistic implica-
tion of Miss Arendt's lecture, even though 
she herself never expressed it quite this 
way. Following Sorel, she entitled her 
talk "Reflections on Violence." It was 
long, despite considerable cutting, and it 
had all the usual trappings that one has 
come to expect in connection with this 
distinguished personage: a huge audience 
(the Law School Auditorium was filled to 
overflowing; I should mention that it also 
happened to be Coed Week), enormous 
charm emanating from the small, neatly-
dressed lady with the strong German 
accent at the dais, a fine, invisible net-
work of paradoxes rapidly engulfing the 
entire hall. 

I thought that her central "reflection," 
or paradox, just did not stand up to 
scrutiny in the long run, as a number of 
the questioners from the audience also 
seemed to sense: her claim was not only 
that power and violence do not, as many 
writers seem to maintain, closely resemble 
each other, but that in the last analysis 
they are opposites. The argument for this 
depends on a conception of political 
power as having necessarily to do with 
popular consent. Once one has accepted 
this assumed definition, then perhaps the 
opposition between violence and power 
could be worked out, but this supposedly 
central point of the lecture struck me, 
I am afraid, as being rather more like a 
brilliant jeu d'esprit than a serious con-
tribution. 

On the other hand, when one has been 
through as many disenchanting experi-
ences, both personal and intellectual, 
concerning the pretensions of humanity 
as has Miss Arendt, then perhaps one 
ought to be not criticized for lapsing into 
occasional jeux d'esprit but applauded 
for not having become totally cynical. 

Hannah Arendt is by no means totally 
cynical: she stands for the ethical claims 
of the individual and against a great range 
of evils that she regards as threatening 
them. She knows her Marx very well, 
even while rejecting him, and she also 
recognizes some fundamental inconsist-
encies in the liberal political philosophy 
(notably, in her Yale lecture, the incon-
sistency of its blind faith in progress). 

But what she claims to know best of all is 
the allegedly eternal nature of man, with 
all its possibilities for both virtue and 
viciousness. Who but a very profound 
student of human nature, after all, could 
pretend to get inside of an Eichmann?

lS I The New Journal I December 8, 1968 
Hannah Arendt began, very much in 
the spirit of A vineri, by announcing that 
those who claim to be Marxists and who 
advocate violence today are in deep con-
tradiction with the basic thought of Marx 
himself; Miss Arendt, too, takes a strongly 
anti-Leninist interpretation of Marx. She 
ended by announcing that violence may 
sometimes achieve political successes, 
provided that it is carefully used only in 
support of short-term goals. Conse-
quently, violence may at times be a proper 
weapon for "revisionists," but never for 
thoroughgoing revolutionaries. Another 
brilliant paradox! 

But we all sometimes tire of paradoxes 
and try to make genuine, even if only 
tentative, commitments. I was not con-
vinced that Hannah Arendt would be of 
much help on such occasions. On the other 
hand, perhaps "truth" itself consists of a 
series of paradoxes; this is the lesson that 
she seemed at times to be implying. And so, 
like much of the audience, I drew from her 
lecture personal conclusions that were 
ce~ainly not parts of its content. Of all 
our lecturers on revolution thus far (1 
here exclude myself), Hannah Arendt 
stood at once for the most and for the 
least. Vigorous, opinionated, forthright, 
enormously well read, widely experi-
enced, with an entire book explicitly on 
revolution (one of the very few recent 
works of any value) to her credit, she ap-
peared as perhaps the closest thing to an 
absolute authority on the subject that the 
academic world can muster today. And 
yet, as she pointed out in answer to one 
of her questioners, the very concept of 
authority is currently in the process of 
disappearing. And those delicately ab-
stract paradoxes of hers teetered peril-
ously close to the brink of an intellectual 
void in which all cats, both revisionist and 
revolutionary, are gray. 

I should return for a moment, by way 
of contrast, to Professor Krippendorff's 
contribution. Despite the formidability of 
his name and title, he was actually quite 
young and quite approachable. Moreover, 
he was the most anxious of all our speak-
ers to insist that he was not a philosopher. 
(He teaches political science at the Free 
University of Berlin.) His insistence, I 
regretfully noted, was well taken: few 
philosophers would have begun quite as 
he did, in his search for a "revolutionary 
subject," by arbitrarily laying down two 
criteria for the new revolutionary sub-
ject (now that we have gone sour on the 
proletariat, or vice versa) and then simply 
trusting that we would accept those criteria 
as the basis of the rest of his paper. At 
least, a philosopher would have been more 
subtle if he had to be arbitrary. 

The more important of the criteria had 
to do with a group's developing a suf-
ficiently clear awareness of its situation 
and of that of society in order to be able 
to act; it was devised in such a way as to 
exclude the modern proletariat and in-
clude today's students, faculty members 
and other intellectuals. Why the oppor-
tunities for awareness were supposed to 
have been so much greater for the nine-
teenth century proletarians than for their 
heirs, so that Marx's analysis could be 
said to have been accurate in his time but 
not at present, was never properly an-
swered for me. 

Despite the graduate coed's chaJlenge, 
Professor Krippendorff's credentials as an 
activist are certainly impressive. He was 
a central figure in a dispute that initiated 
the Berlin student protest of the last sev-
eral years. As a member of the German 
SDS, be has had ample contact with the 
politics (or non-politics) of confronta-
tion. Nevertheless, his prescription for 
broadening revolutionary consciousness 
among students and intellectuals certainly 
relegated public demonstrations to a sub-
ordinate role. His vision was rather rev-
olutionary, but his view of tactics relied 
heavily on the old-fashioned method of 
education. His present stance seemed to 
me, in the end, to be hopelessly intel-
lectual, and though I found him enor-
mously personable, I saw little hope for 
the ultimate success of the kind of revolu-
tion that he envisaged. In the long run, I 
thought, be would be at his best in a class-
room rather than in a street confrontation.
