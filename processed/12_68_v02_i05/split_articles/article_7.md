Not mah-jong, not chinese checkers; 
the name of the game is still entertainment 
by Rodger Kamenetz and Jeffrey Pollock 
In a wide-angle shot Humphrey Evans Ill looks like 
Joe Dallesandro from Warhol's movie Flesh: eyes 
half-open, making love to the ever-present camera. 
Cross legs, raise eye-brows and laugh knowingly into 
the lens. But as the camera moves to a close-up, an 
alert, intelligent and dedicated musician and com-
poser is seen, whose works have been performed by 
symphonies coast to coast. 
"Glamour. That's what it is," Humphrey insists in 
speaking of his hero Warhol. "He's a serious innovator 
in his art form, yet what he and his group do is often so 
antithetical to traditional form or subject matter that 
he necessarily puts you down. I mean that he's estab-
lished a kind of integration of New Art and New Life-
style, and he presents it with a flamboyance and 
assuredness that says, 'My style is a valid alternative 
to yours, either accept it for what it is or be left out!' " 
In Humphrey's own work a similar self-justifying 
philosophy has evolved. Like Warhol's cinema, his 
music is a combination of a classical background and 
a unique philosophy for his own art. The freak-world 
Superstar and the musical genius, two scenes in a 
film, two faces for Yale and two personalities for Hum-
phrey Evans Ill. 
" People should act as they feel," Humphrey insists. 
"If they are bored they should say so. The music, as I 
see it, is trying to reach over the protective barriers 
and grab the audience, physically or sexually or in-
tellectually. And they should react to that. There's not 
enough physicality at Yale. People aren't responding 
to about ninety-five percent of their feelings." 

To establish a community of adequate response and 
sharing, Humphrey and a group of friends formed a 
musical group called "Morton, baby" (named after 
New York composer Morton Feldman) to play some of 
his compositions at a concert in Washington this 
summer. 
Matt Huxley, son of Aldous Huxley and a friend of 
the Evans family, was familiar with Humphrey's music 
and recommended him to the director of the concert 
series at the Smithsonsian Institute. Several tapes of 
Humphrey's musical compositions were heard, and a 
concert date was set in August. It was suggested that 
the core of the ensemble be the group in New Haven, 
augmented by several professional musicians to be 
hired in Washington. 
Paul Severtson, violinist and concertmaster of the 
Yale Symphony, had met Humphrey three years ago 
through the Music School. Humphrey was planning a 
happening, presumably the first ever at Yale, and he 
needed someone to come out of a volcano on stage. 
Paul was suggested, and his performance was a great 
success. Other common interests in music made 
them close friends. 
Burr Van Nostrand, cellist for both the Yale and 
New Haven Symphonies, played chamber music with 
Paul in California. In his third year at the New England 
Conservatory in Boston, he received a visit from Paul 
and Humphrey urging him to play for the Smithsonian 
concert in August. Burr not only accepted but moved 
to New Haven to continue his composing. 
Stephen " Lucky" Mosko, a percussionist for the 
Yale Symphony, taught Humphrey to play the tam-
bourine for a concert last March. A former percus-
sionist and assistant conductor at fifteen for the Brico 
Symphony in Denver, Lucky began composing with 
Humphrey, and the two worked together on the new 
musical notation Humphrey was preparing for the con-
cert. 
The four musicians were joined by Bruce "Booze" 
Hamsome, a friend of Humphrey's at Yale who was to 
play the part of "Superstar" in the final piece, Sales-
man. They spent a week rehearsing at Humphrey's 
house, working up to twenty hours a day. 
" We worked so intensely together on this show, I'd 
say we did about a hundred hours a piece on it," 
Humphrey remembers. "For five of us, that's five hun-
dred hours of very intense creative work. We found 
that we began to establish our own language, that the 
program became a self-referential closed unit. But 
we didn't take ourselves too seriously. In a sense it

joring in intensive English. 
became one big 'in joke,' but it had value in that we 
were so personally involved." 

The basis for the language the group established 
was a highly stylized method of notation Humphrey 
had been developing for the past two years. In his 
music, scores are set up in checkerboard patterns 
with geometric diagrams, arrows, word images and 
some musical notation. Each unit of music repre-
sented is open to interpretation by the musician. The 
ideal is not so much improvision as a highly integrated 
expression of personal moods or "gestures." 
Although the idea of different notation is itself not 
new (composer Cornelius Cardew has published a 
book of similar scores), Humphrey brings to his com-
posing the idea of " gestural music." The music is 
supposed to be an expression of personality through 
gestures suggested by the composer to the performer, 
as a man's walk or the way he speaks says something 
about his personality. 
" Part of the purpose of the notation is to free the 
musician so that he can concentrate on what he is do-
ing. In the Yale Symphony, for instance, m.ost of the 
students have only a very little time to rehearse--per-
haps just the few hours of rehearsal plus any work 
they can do on their own. Now, the symphony did a 
Schoenberg piece along with my Night Sky Music that 
was fully notated and very complex. The musicians 
had to spend most of their time learning how to get 
their fingers around theirlnstruments. With my piece, 
hopefully, they could begin to get into what the music 
is all about. 
"The music is a way of observing 'natural process' 
as it functions in one's daily life; like trying to get 
tv, education and Miami Beach all into one's music." 
Humphrey smiles and shrugs his shoulders. 
"I suppose that when Beethoven first introduced his 
music the people thought It was outrageous and in-
accessible. To make them sensitive to what he was 
doing, Beethoven had to convince them he was sin-
cere in what he was presenting." Humphrey leaned 
forward. 
" It's not even a matter of liking or disliking the piece 
you are performing. I remember at Tanglewood the 
Boston Symphony was doing a piece and there was a 
musician who absolutely abhorred my work and 
everything it stood for, yet he did a very fine job of 
playing it. Then there were some people who thought 
it was a real gas but didn't take it seriously enough 
and felt that they could fool around and play sloppily." 

Humphrey's music had been performed by the pro-
fessionals of large symphony orchestras, and also by 
a group of high-school musicians in Boston Sym-
phony Hall. 
" That was beautiful. All these kids together in front 
of thousands of people and TV cameras. I had to give 
them a strong, bold piece that fitted the importance of 
the occasion. They did a great job because they were 
serious about the music yet they were having fun. 
" In writing I try to take the music seriously without 
being too self-conscious or overblown about what I 
am doing." He smiled and continued, "In the program 
notes to one concert, I wrote that the final statement 
about the music might be expressed as 'official 
whimsy.' 
" I suppose it's like playing a game: chess, mah-
jong or better yet, some absurd game like chinese 
checkers. There's a way to play any game, with fin-
esse and skill. If you don't take the rules of the game 
seriously or if you play it disinterestedly, then the 
game is pointless and no fun." 
" Notation is nothing more than an ordered and ac-
cepted way of conveying information. So gestural 
notation influences not only content but also what we 
mean by information. The interplay between com-
poser and performer is as important as the relation-
ship between performer and audience. The notation 
also blurs the distinction between the classical forms 
or art; it is a visual experience in graphics, and it de-
mands of the musician a dramatic as well as musical 
interpretation. In one of my pieces the violinists talk 
while they play." 

In last summer's concert with "Morton, baby," the 
gestural notation made different kinds of demands on 
the performing musicians. "I spent hours looking at 
the score, studying my part," Lucky explained. "In one 
of the pieces, Calais graffiti IV, there was the notation

'Red Scarf!' so I wore a red scarf around my neck. 
And one of the tapes that I was to play during the 
piece was the soundtrack of an Indian movie with a 
title which turned out to mean Red Scarf." 
Meanwhile, Paul had read his part of the score and 
decided that he had to begin playing his piece in front 
of the Chinese embassy that morning. So Lucky drove 
him out, and Paul played his violin for several hours 
to the minions of Chiang Kai-Shek. 
" Paul's performance is really important in under-
standing what is going on in this kind of musical 
theory." Lucky continued " Three things were going on 
at once. Humphrey was backstage at this point, listen-
ing to a piece he had composed but not knowing that 
Paul had played at the embassy that morning. And the 
audience didn't know that they were only hearing 
the last two hours of Paul's playing. The important 
thing is that this separation doesn't matter. Humphrey 
once composed a vibraphone piece for me called 
7:15a.m., in which I began playing in the backyard at 
7:15 the morning of the concert." 
Paul's score for Calais also read " establish radio 
contact," so several blocks from the Embassy he 
turned on the car radio. That night, Bruce was in a cab 
on the way to the concert when he realized he had 
forgotten his autoharp. He had his cab driver call the 
cab Paul was in to see if Paul had the autoharp. The 
call came when Paul was passing the spot near the 
Embassy where he established "radio contact" 
earlier. So in the performance, Paul's interpretation 
was directly related to Bruce and what he was play-
ing. 
The entire group spent the afternoon before the 
concert drawing different figures in the blank spaces 
provided for Bruce's biography on the programs. 
Just as the music explored the problem of words or 
symbols giving information to the performers, so any 
program notes questioned the wnole idea of trying 
to talk about the individual biographies of the per-
formers. 
. 
The group gathered props for the concert: a Vic-
torian couch that remained on stage throughout the 
performance, a coat hanger bent to look like the 
Spirit of St. Louis (from which Lucky hung his percus-
sion instruments) and twenty miscellaneous un-
breakable objects (a syringe, a mannequin head, etc.) 
that Bruce was to play in Salesman. 
About four hundred people came to the smaller 
auditorium at the Smithsonian that night to hear "The 
Music of Humphrey Evans Ill." Balding men in suits 
and their big-breasted w ives confronted the cluttered 
stage and young members of " Morton, baby." With 
the opening piece, an aria called "dolce madre" from 
Pyramus and Thisbe, the audience was won over. 
"The piece was modern and dramatic and humor-
ous," Lucky explained, " and the people loved it. Es-
pecially Burr's singing. They applauded as he walked 
off stage, but he got lost behind the screen and wan-
dered on stage again. The audience applauded 
wildly." 
The first half of the program was generally con-
servative, with only twenty people walking out During 
intermission, Lucky played a tape from a Bela Lugosi 
soundtrack at the exact level of the audience noise. 
Before the intermission was over, Lucky began to play 
his part in Calais, and the musical expression in gen-
eral became freer. 
In Salesman, Burr played with the twenty assorted 
objects on stage and moved through the audience 
singing " soup ... soap" and throwing dog biscuits to 
the audience. Lucky came out to serenade an elderly 
lady on the super-mandolin and then presented her 
with a bill for ten dollars. 
" The audience was great," Humphrey concluded. 
" But the question always comes up about 'under-
standing.' People think they don't understand us, but 
then-" Humphrey paused, " they do." A quick nod of 
assurance. " After all they pay to see us, they come 
and get angry at us, or they react in some strong way, 
and then they get away and say they didn't under-
stand us. It's a shame, but it seems that people con-
fronted with something new get very upset. 
"It's funny, but the nicest audience I ever had was 
in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. This was when I was tour-
ing with the New Orleans Symphony. It was a very 
hot Sunday evening, and the place wasn't air condi-
tioned so everyone was sweating, and all these-
matronly belles were waving their fans. They really 
liked the music and after the concert, they came up on 
stage all flower dressed and powder breasted and 
practically smothered me to death." Then, in a per-
fect deep South falsetto, he imitated, "Whah, Mistuh 
Eh-vans, yo' music was just mah-velous!" 

The members of " Morton, baby" were sitting 
around listening to Bulgarian folk music the first week 
of school. " We were drunk in Paul's room-intensely 
drunk and crying-and someone said, w hy don't we 
play at a mixer-and three days later we had a con-
tract." Two new members, Lucky's brother Marty 
Mosko and Jeff Fuller, had been added to the group. 
Marty is a senior linguistics major, playwright and 
poet. Jeff is a graduate student in music, a composer 
and former member of the Hard Corps. 
Except for Jeff, none of the people in the room had 
ever played in a rock band before. But somehow, in 
the secret depths of their drunkeness they discovered 
that amongst them was the collective soul of a rock 
and roll extravagana. 
Steve Goldin thought so. As chairman of the Bran-
ford College Social Committee, he helped decide to 
hire the band. Originally they were to perform at a 
mixer with another band, but plans were changed and 
" Not Morton, baby" made its solo debut in the Bran-
ford dining hall, at ten o'clock the Friday evening of 
Dartmouth weekend. 
They began setting up around seven o'clock that 
night and needed every minute of the three hours, for 
they were " really overkilling the sound" as Jeff Fuller 
said, hooking up enough amplification equipment to 
burst at least a few eardrums. Each instrument was 
individually amplified: Jeff's electric guitar and Paul's 
electric violin and Burr's electric cello and Marty's 
electric piano. Also on stage were Marty's set for 
" Salesman," the final piece, and a real live bathtub for 
the first number, " Amphetafish.'' Ed Ferraro, the 
manager of the group, his face painted orange and 
green, surveyed the scene with tlis customary scep-
ticism, wondering whether or not the stage would fall 
in under the weight. 
At ten o'clock they began coming in. " The lads for 
the girls and the lads for the liquor were there," the 
straights all suited up in triumphant plaids and college 
ties, ushering their dates ahead of them with arms 
perhaps a little too self-consciously outstretched; and 
those other people too, in pajamas and flowing silks 
and arab burnooses and outlandish kerchiefs and 
beads, with painted clothes and painted faces all day-
glo, hip halloweeners dancing on All Saints' Day. 
The freaks had been summoned by Humphrey and 
Lucky to do their bit in Salesman, Humphrey's piece; 
about thirty of them were holding two page scripts 
which read like this: First, be an audience for 21 
minutes and 10 seconds, dancing ad libitum but not so 
as to attract attention to yourself ... Situations: 
boredom in the midst of chaos; chaos in the midst of 
crashing; getting angrier, embarrassment for grass-
stains on one's new pants ... getting more intense 
and starting a La Crepe society, vomiting on one's 
new hat; shattering the mind, making tea with meat-
tenderizer." 

In order to perform these functions, they brought 
paraphernalia: old socks, a toy pistol, an orange traf-
fic pylon, an ancient crucifix. The straights clumped 
together and stared in bewilderment at the freaks. Or 
perhaps what caught their eye was the incredible 
band itself, surrounded by strands of barbed wire. 
" You've got an instrument in your hand," Paul had 
said, " and it's very loud. It's you, but magnified hun-
dreds of times. That's power, though it's a very safe 
kind of power because nobody's going to get killed 
or be poor because of it ... But in a sense, we ac-
knowledge that we're hostile." 
Paul himself looked least hostile, in fact, mostly 
angelic, dressed all in white with a Donovan blouse. 
Thin, intense Burr, in a white skin waistcoat and silk 
shirt, was aloof as he turned his cello. But Lucky, yes 
Lucky was truly hostile, if only as an act, with his 
black leather jacket, black boots and sunglasses. He 
sat before his drums and he was no longer Lucky, he 
was Ginger Baker, with a cigar dangling from the 
side of his mouth. 
Finally, Lucky arrived and began the first piece of

the rock concert, Also Sprach Zarathustra by Rick 
Strauss. The straights in the crowd were very an-
noyed. "Why don't you play something?" a short guy 
in a dark suit shouted. 
Humphrey did a rendition of "Past, Present and 
Future," a song made memorable by the Shangri-Las. 
"But don't try to touch me," he warned in a convincing 
falsetto at the climax of the song, "because that will 
never happen again." 
Burr's cello work was the dramatic element of 
"California Dreamin?" This was the big hit with all the 
guys who had been yelling for music to dance to. 
When he played, he stared forward with intense con-
centration; alone with his music he seemed almost 
oblivious to the ruckus going on around him. 
Lucky was the star in a strange "free blooz improv" 
that followed. While Paul's violin conversed with 
Jeff's guitar, he took the rhythm of the song to wild 
heights, flailing his arms, nodding his head back and 
forth and losing his glasses, getting in an incredible 
number of extra beats and then suddenly collapsing 
the rhythm on purpose by missing the beats, until the 
piece wound down like an old watch. 
Finally, the time arrived for Salesman. Humphrey 
had been working on the piece since last summer. It 
is incredibly complex, involving music for the band, 
scripts for thirty actors and dancing choreographed 
by Martin Wilkes. Salesman would run for forty-five 
minutes, and the plan was for a snow-ball effect; as 
the music began to build towards a climax, more and 
more actors in the audience would begin performing 
until chaos set in. 
The sound of Salesman was amazing, anarchic. It 
rose and fell; each musician was wrapped up in his 
own secret battle with his score, as if the music pro-
duced was a prize wrested from a devil' by a struggling 
soul. 
Fistfights broke out; a drunk was kicked in the 
teeth while he crawled on the floor. A group in the 
center bowed to the floor in worship of the moose on 
the wall. Burning incense added a touch of Oriental 
sanctity to group gropes conducted between vast 
puddles of beer. 
And the band played on. They were gesturing, and 
it is as difficult to describe what their music meant as 
to describe what any gesture means. "When you play 
the same way you talk," Humphrey said, "well, you 
don't ask yourself, Do you talk good? do you talk bad? 
That doesn't mean much. You feel good about it-
it feels honest. Sometimes you look at it later and it's · 
pretty hostile or screwed up or something else, but 
it's real; and it makes them do real things too." 
"Not Morton, baby" played that close to themselves 
-as they talked-and suddenly they reached a point 
where they were all coming together in an insane 
crescendo: Lucky beating the cymbals furiously, Paul 
bowing very high and very fast, Burr attacking the 
cello with quick stabs and Humphrey, as if he had 
found yet another self, chanting in incredible falsetto. 
And at this point, the lights came on. Not Morton 
baby was busted. 
The way it happened to Mitchell Marks was that he 
was playing with a toy gun which he pulled on a man 
in a trench coat and said, "Bang, bang, you're dead." 
The man in trench coat turned out to be a cop and 
the gun was quickly confiscated in a move no doubt 
taught in police training school. Mitchell eluded his 
pursuer by crawling among a group of dancers. 
The way it happened to Steve Goldin, chairman of 
the Branford Social committee was that a single 
campus policeman happened to come in, and notic-
ing strange-looking people having a good time with 
candles an<:~ incense, concluded that dangerous and 
illegal drugs were present and that it was his duty to 
call the New Haven police. Steve trying to persuade 
him that this wasn't necessary was forced to turn on 
the lights and stop the show. 
Ultimately, seven campus policeman arrived. Their 
presence reaching the stage through a series of mes-
sengers, "Salesman" was stopped about twenty-five 
minutes before due. A quick conference was called. 
Lucky's reaction was to keep playing, but Humphrey 
allowed as how he was tired anyway. But with con-
siderable confusion still reigning, the band went on 
and played "Somewhere over the Rainbow" and also 
"Yesterday," with Bruce "booz" Hamsome as 
featured singer. 
· 
And so the evening ended. The lights were on. The 
police asked those who weren't cleaning up to leave 
the hall. It was an incredible wreck of splashed beer 
and confetti and broken ballons and wire mesh and 
candle wax and paper cups. Humphrey and Burr and 
Lucky and Marty and Jeff and Paul relaxed with the 
bathtub behind stage. Humphrey felt that such a 
dramatic appearance by the police could .not help 
but make Not Morton, baby a success. 
After "Not Morton, baby" the group has been con-
. tracted to appear in concert at Columbia this winter 
and in a club date at the Gaslight Cafe. Aside from 
the Warhol-like changes from Superstar to concert 
musician-composer and back to Superstar, Hum-
phrey is pretty much the same. In the short auto-
biography for the program notes at the Smithsonian, 
Humphrey wrote: 
"Born in new york city, 1948. travelled, orthodon-
tistry, lonely, etc. compositions, finally, nothing else, 
really. pleased with that. worked nights mostly. ended 
up at Yale. spent a summer at Tanglewood. recently 
found some friends, but still writing music, still 
pleased."
