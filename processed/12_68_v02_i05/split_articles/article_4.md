Malraux: hero, 
Jansenist and J acobin 
by Henri Peyre 
Andre Malraux, Anti-memoirs. Translated 
by Terence Kilmartin. New York; Holt, 
Rinehart and Winston, 1968,420 pp. 
The publication of the strange, shapeless, 
unorthodox Anti-memoirs by the French 
minister of culture was preceded and fol-
lowed last year in France with an orches-
tration of publicity, interviews and book 
reviews which antagonized the more fas-
tidious readers. The parties of the left and 
a number of intellectuals who probably 
vote for De Gaulle but would not for any-
thing in the world confess it and who vi-
tuperate against the regime, loudly vented 
their rancor; they see in Malraux a former 
revolutiona.ry who has betrayed the cause. 
Not a few of them, whose liberal convic-
tions have seldom brought them to act and 
incur risks (signing petitions for all vic-
tims of injustice, tyranny and racism is 
their favorite pastime around their cafe 
tables), secretly envy in Malraux the man 
of action who has been in jail at least twice, 
fought in several wars, courted death half 
a dozen times. At sixty-seven (he was 
born in November 1901), while others 
delight in questioning and confronting 
what they call l'icriture, Malraux is still 
the greatest master of vividly and imagina-
tively wielded language in France and 
probably in Europe. The Swedish Aca-
demy has been intimidated by him more 
than it was by Sartre and has not as yet 
selected him; yet Anti-memoirs towers

miles above the minor masterpiece and the 
confession of discouragement which Les 
Mots was. Several years earlier, when 
Camus received the news of the award, he 
proclaimed at once that the Nobel Prize 
laureate should have been Malraux, whose 
achievement will long outlive his. With all 
its faults, which are glaring, Anti-memoirs 
is the most striking book, probably the one 
work of genius, to have come out of West-
ern Europe in a dozen years. 
The volume is long, rambling at times, 
written with little concern for the pedes-
trian reader. Malraux is famous for his 
monologues and might remark like Sten-
dahl at leaving a party: "I have not been 
bored one minute; I spoke all the time." 
Here he has shown some ability to listen. 
But in reporting his dialogues with 
De Gaulle, Nehru, Mao and a few other 
interlocutors of lesser magnitude, he has 
lent them his own imperious, elliptical 
style. The reader is bewildered and no 
longer knows which of the two giants is 
saying what. Chronology is haughtily dis-
regarded. Transitions, once the darlings of 
French rhetoricians and careful reasoners 
striving for the French goal of suite dans 
les idees, are skipped. Fitful memories, or 
rather visions of the past, are interspersed 
capriciously with reflections made today; 
experiences of thirty years ago are con-
trasted with present observations. The only 
order is that in which memory conjures 
up the past. Yet no volume could be more 
anti-Proust ian than this recovery of time 
past enshrined in the present. Malraux has 
no patience whatever with his childhood, 
which he contemptuously ignores; none 
with the probing into one's inner life, 
none with the questions which have fasci-
nated other authors of confessions, from 
Rousseau to Sartre and Simone de Beau-
voir: "How and why have I become the 
one that I am?" Not one word about his 
adolescent revolt, if he ever experienced 
one. Not one about his loves or his sexual 
life, about Clara Goldschmitt Malraux 
(his first wife) who has not been so discreet 
herself when relating her memories of 
the man who had been her husband for 
twenty-five years. 
Much else is omitted from these discon-
nected but passionate reminiscences: the 
author's visits to Russia under Stalin and 
to the Germany of Hitler (who refused to 
receive him); his role as organizer of Re-
publican propaganda in the Spanish Civil 
War; his trip to the United States in 1937, 
after he had been wounded in that Civil 
War; his conversations with President 
Kennedy and his wife in 1962; his con-
tacts with French Communists when, 
though never a member of the Party, be 
struggled alongside them in 1933-36; his 
many conversations with Valery, Gide, 
Martin du Gard, Le Corbusier ; his mother, 
who never appears in this book or in his 
fiction. We are told that three more vol-
umes of Anti-memoirs are to follow, prob-
ably posthumously. Several pages in the 
present work already read as, in the phrase 
of Chateaubriand: Memories from be-
yond the grave. 
The willful, stubborn disorder in which 
these reminiscences, vignettes and reflec-
tions are thrown here may upset sticklers 
for structural order. With a little ingenuity, 
some of them, in learned articles, will 
someday discover some hidden organiza-
tion here and a zealously masked logic 
under the desultoriness of the variegated 
chapters, as they are naively proud of do-
ing in the fantasies of Montaigne and of 
Diderot. Malraux cares little and has 
never courted critics. He is a classic and
