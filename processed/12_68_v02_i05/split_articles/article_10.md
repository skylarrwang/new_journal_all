**Reason and Revolution Today and other Reflections**
**Author:  Unlisted**
**Page number(s): 16-17**

And thus the stage is set for Herbert 
Marcuse, who, significantly enough, follows another member of our department, 
Professor Kenley Dove. Dove spoke on 
"Revolution and Recognition," acknowledging the debt that, my colleague rightly 
feels, we all owe to Hegel in this whole 
area of thought. Marcuse is intensely 
aware of that debt: his best-known early 
work, Reason and Revolution, is sub-
titled Hegel and the Rise of Social 
Theory. On December 9, Professor Mar-
cuse is scheduled to speak here on "Reason and Revolution Today." Recently, 
more people have been reading Marcuse 
than ever before; perhaps just as much 
to the point, even more people have been 
reading about Marcuse. Enough newspaper and magazine articles about him 
have appeared recently to make it superfluous for me to add to this literature. 
He is, of course, credited with having 
inspired French, German and Italian students in their 1968 uprisings, though he 
himself has many doubts about the directions that some of the rebels have been 
taking. 

I remember him from several of his 
past visits to Yale: he gives the appearance 
of a gentle, aging German professor. He 
himself, one thinks in looking at him, 
would hardly be capable of leading even 
a mild movement of dissent at a faculty 
meeting. In his person and in his career, 
in short, he epitomizes many of the concerns and the dilemmas that I have expressed in these reflections. 

There are many facets to Herbert 
Marcuse's complex, systematic social 
philosophy. If I had the space, I would 
like to say something about his debts to 
Hegel and Marx, about his optimistic 
revision of Freud in allowing for the possibility of a non-repressive future society, 
about the knotty problems of democracy 
and coercion that he discusses in his essay 
on "Repressive Toleration," and about 
his profound though not unanswerable 
critiques of the methodologies that still 
dominate much of our Academic Establishment. 

But I shall mention only a single point 
that bears most closely, I think, on our 
series and its possible results. It is well 
that Marcuse views the institutions and 
ideologies of advanced western industrial 
societies as being organized so as to intensify "one-dimensionality"—that is, 
the ultimate elimination even of all 
thought about the possibility of a radically 
different way of life from the present 
one. In this connection, Marcuse points 
out how important it is that philosophy 
too should fall in line if the baneful 
dominance of "positive thinking" is to 
be made complete. Historically, according to Marcuse, philosophy's role has 
been quite the opposite: from Plato on, 
even when thinkers like Hegel seemed to 
be defenders of the Establishment, their 
philosophies have upheld the "power of 
the negative," of dissent and criticism, 
by showing that the universe of thought 
and discourse was not limited to the 
actual, given world of the immediate 
present. In short, traditional philosophy 
has always been, in terms of its inner logic 
and its raison d'etre, potentially revolutionary. 

If this is so—and I am inclined to agree 
with the thesis—then the fears that I expressed earlier about interpreting our series 
as a subconscious counter-revolutionary 
plot were groundless. It was not just a love 
of incongruity or a public-relations ploy 
that motivated us to invite Eldridge 
Cleaver (who, in one of the ironies typical 
of our age, was forced to postpone his 
appearance on the advice of his lawyer) 
to appear in the same series with Hannah 
Arendt. They both belonged there, and 
we have been trying to understand better 
exactly why. As philosophers, we are not 
committed to any particular strain of 
political activism nor, certainly, to the 
idea that any old social change is always 
necessarily better than sheer immobility. 
But we are committed to the proposition 
that reason and revolution belong in conjunction, as Marcuse's title would have 
it, rather than in opposition; and we have 
been trying, with the help of our guest 
speakers, to understand this conjunction 
in which it may exist in our own, vastly 
confusing times.

Mrs. Kelly: "Alright, I'm saying to you 
that I'm saved, I'm a Christian and I want 
to take my grandchildren to church like 
my mother took me, but they ain't got 
any decent clothes." 

"There's a worker, speaks Spanish, Mrs. 
Cobb or something like that. She's in my 
area, but I don't have her. Some women 
that do, they can't make it today—they 
got babies, she doesn't give them any 
underclothes." 

"These are the sort of things we appointed Mr. Samuels for." 

"Back when you said people got raised, 
I got lowered. I was getting $164 for four 
kids and now it's $140, and my rent and 
water costs $75." 

"I don't know your answer." 

"Well I don't either."

**Letters to the Editors**

Letters 
To the Editors: 
Congratulations to Bonnie McGregor for 
her moving and accurate description of 
the way Yale Graduate School turns 
people into products. The process of depersonalization she described with reference to women also mutilates men. The 
Graduate School is a concentration camp 
of the human spirit. As for Joyce Irwin's 
conceited outburst, the only appropriate 
response is: "Up against the wall, father-
fucker!" 
Peter J. O'Connell 
Fourth-year Graduate Student 

A recent comment by Miss Bonnie 
McGregor bemoans the status of women 
graduate students at Yale. Apparently 
our experiences here over a number of 
years have been different than Miss 
McGregor's. We came here for various 
reasons and have stayed and worked because we have found encouragement and 
incentive to develop as individuals, as 
scientists, and as women. 

We do not think that women at Yale 
are viewed only as "bods." It is a natural 
reaction for men and women to notice 
each other and appreciate certain physical 
qualities. We do not find this to be offensive in general or at Yale. 

Maybe Miss McGregor has had some 
unfortunate experiences in her classes, 
but we have never felt that our minds 
were being raped or our psyches prostituted. We have never been "put down" 
in a class for anything for which a male 
graduate student would not have been 
similarly "put down." Whatever discrimination exists at Yale has never been 
detrimental to us. In fact, one of us has 
found the attitudes toward an individual 
at Yale to be less biased by that person's 
sex than in many other academic or professional environments. 

There are, certainly, problems for 
serious women graduate students, both 
practical and personal problems. We feel, 
however, that these problems arise not 
specifically from the policies and attitudes 
of the Yale Graduate School but from 
more general causes.

I was fascinated by Mary Wright's article 
on Mao and the cultural revolution, but 
there are a few things about the whole 
area of psychohistory that I just don't 
understand. First of all, psychohistory 
does not seem to be historical. All of 
Robert Lifton's works—and they seem to 
be defining what psychohistory is—are 
concerned with contemporary events. 
Rather than history, the whole psycho-
historical process seems to be aimed at 
making political science more interesting; 
denuding it of boring numbers, computers 
and games to determine the future in 
order to understand what is really happening in the world. Mary Wright made 
Lifton's work look like a terribly important new field of study and what is 
needed now is a place to go study it.
