For My People 
by Margaret Walker 
An important reissue 
When this book of poetry won the Yale 
Series of Younger Poets award in 1942, 
Stephen Vincent Ben~t . then Editor of the 
Series, said In his Foreword : " StraightÂ· 
forwardness, directness, reality are good 
things to find In a young poet. It is rarer 
to find them combined with a controlled 
intensity of emotion and a language that, 
at times, even when it is most modern, 
has something of the surge of biblical 
poetry. And it Is obvious that Miss Walker 
uses that language because it comes 
naturally to her and is part of her 
inheritance ... . 'We Have Been Believers,' 
'Delta,' 'Southern Song,' 'For My People' 
- they are full of the rain and the sun that 
fall upon the faces and shoulders of her 
people, full of the bitter questioning and 
the answers not yet found, the pride and 
the disillusion and the reality . ... She has 
spoken of her people so that all may 
listen." 
Because in 1968 another generation, both 
black and white, is eager to listen, Yale 
University Press takes pleasure in making 
this volume available once again. 
Margaret Walker's voice deserves a new 
hearing in these new times.
