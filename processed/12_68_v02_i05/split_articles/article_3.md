**Political Order in Changing Societies**
**Author: Samuel P. Huntington**

Political 
Order 
in 
Changing 
Societies 
by Samuel P. Huntington 
The major causes of violence and 
instability in the emerging countries of 
Asia, Africa, and Latin America, 
argues Mr. Huntington, are to be found 
in the lag in the development of 
political institutions behind social and 
economic change. Focusing on ways 
of creating new, effective bases for 
political association, he offers 
valuable insights on age-old problems 
of political change In both Western 
and non-Western societies. 
Samuel P. Huntington is Frank G. 
Thomson Professor of Government 
and chairman of the department of 
government at Harvard University.

student illiteracy raise themselves before 
otherwise fine minds." 
poetry and painting, without spending days 
bound in the red tape that separates de-
partments. Success in a program like this 
will depend on the students. As faculty 
and students continue to rethink old 
courses and suggest new ones, the faculty 
will find that teaching freshly is not in-
dulging whims, and the students will find 
that courses are not merely pieces of ad-
ministrative property. 
6) Abolish that albatross known as 
"comps." This topic usurps all discussions 
of reform in the major. Eyes flash, throats 
tighten, fists clench as the spectres of de-
partmental tyranny or vast student illit-
eracy raise themselves before otherwise 
fine minds. (Only great epithets, no re-
forms, come from these heats of passion: 
"You scholastic, you J aosenist bastard 
you!") Yet even those faculty members 
who breathe excitedly about a Platonic 
Form of The Comps admit that in practice 
the departmental exam has not worked at 
all well. And if it has not worked well and 
if the committee method of creation holds 
little promise for future success, why con-
tinue it either as a sole requirement for 
graduation or as one possibility among 
others? It wastes time to argue about it, to 
take it, to grade it. 
7) Help all majors make the senior year 
a significant conclusion. With a faculty 
advisor, each senior could plan a project 
to give coherence to his major. Together 
they could determine the credits to be 
earned and the program to be followed. 
Together they might evaluate the success 
of the effort ... but this last is probably 
only in that apocalyptic future when gen-
eration gaps are bridged by rainbows, Nor-
man Mailer is director of undergraduate 
studies and courses in the graduate English 
department are modeled on seminars in 
Yale College. 
As the professor walked off, be shouted 
back against the wind, "If you do, don't 
forget to put in something about the pur-
pose of the major." One thought: pur-
poses, not a purpose; majors, not a major. 
And thought some more: but should the 
department construct a coherence to the 
major? No. It can't. Since the student 
chooses a limited number of courses, the 
department's job is to provide courses for 
his selection and set the number necessary 
for graduation. The major itself is what-
ever coherence emerges from a student's 
choices. Courses belong to the depart-
ment; the major belongs to the student. If 
the courses are working, why should the 
department feel the need to test or assign 
anything apart from those courses? The 
questions go on too long. Better terse: Co-
herence is a matter of individual experi-
ence, not administrative fiat.
