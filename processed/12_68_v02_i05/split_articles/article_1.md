**Title: In Comment: a poor unsuspecting Unoptypist is forced to create poetry, and life with mother isn't quite the same as life with father; especially when its raining.**

If you attended the reading by last year's Yale Younger Poet you know such a character exists, even if you don't know how.

Most likely you couldn't care less whether the Yale Press ever finds a new judge for its contest. If you hope to publish your own poetry someday, no doubt you'll be (or you already are) too sophisticated to think you'll have any luck in this highly establishment competition.

At a very literary cocktail party a knowing raconteur might share with you the following inside apocryphal item: Several years ago, the judge of Yale Younger Poets considered the manuscript of a youngish man. "This is the best manuscript I've ever read," said the judge (verbatim to give the illusion of drama). "But the world is not ready for this sort of poetry." The little-magazine world had appreciated the work in question for years, but the Yale Press world could not meet the challenge.

So the judge selected another manuscript for the prize, a collection of poems by a young lady whose lack of verbal control neatly matched her lack of ideas and imagination (as the same judge admitted in correspondence). Young men had won in recent years. The world was ready that year for a female poet. It got her, as they say, with a vengeance.

Your raconteur might go on to point out that of the two poets involved the man has not yet had a book of his poems done (he's now beyond the age-limit of Yale's contest), whereas the young lady has several books out, each sillier than the last. On her behalf Yale's recognition has exerted an artificial influence. For him, perhaps the failure mirrored an entrenched mistrust throughout academic and commercial publishing of experimental poetry.

Recently a note in the Yale Daily News announced the Yale Younger Poet for 1968. A good time to ask, What is a Yale Younger Poet anyway? An adventurous young writer who wins an early chance at an audience? Or an imitator in early middle age who wins approval for following instructions? The rules require entrants to be poets under 40 who have not yet published books of their own poetry. Fine, but the results have made only certain styles acceptable for union membership.

Early generations of Yale Younger Poets have left little trace on American poetry. Then W. H. Auden took over. A few of his choices are now, in their maturity, making more than a dent: W. S. Merwin (Y.Y.P. 49) and James Wright (Y.Y.P. 53) for two. Both Wright and Merwin won the award for books much more academic and much less interesting than their present work, but a poet-watcher must be grateful for the chance they won to develop into the poets who last year produced The Branch Will Not Break and The Lice. After Auden, Dudley Fitts, famous as a translator and teacher, judged the manuscripts until his death this summer. His choice in 1961, Alan Dugan, won the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize, a sign not only of Fitts' sure instinct for the style of the moment but also of his clear insight. Dugan's angry intelligence in that first book opened up formal and stylistic possibilities for other poets.

From the inside, a choice looks inevitable, since ninety percent of the manuscripts come from the proverbial housewife in Duluth, faithful attendant at summer sessions of Creative Writing Programs at midwestern universities. From the outside, the choice looks impossible: how can you be sure any younger poet will justify your award when the wisdom of your judgment is itself judged years later? However you choose you go out on an historical limb; yet judges of the Yale Younger Poets rarely go out on artistic limbs. A Yale Younger Poet "experiments" by playing cute tricks, like writing a "Joy Sonnet" by instructing the printer to fill out a certain-size block with "Ia's." A Yale Younger Poet may have heard about action elsewhere in American poetry; he never makes the running.

The Yale Younger Poets series has come to define an acceptable style of poetic limitation, unambitious and inward. No reason why such a poet should not win a prize once in a while. But once in a while, not every year. Appointing the judge for an indefinite period-or life-installs one opinion in authority far too long, making taste rigid, making a single style a (false) standard.

Benefits of the prize for the poet are obvious. For the audience's benefit, this competition could yearly focus on the best example of one current poetic mode. If a new judge came in every three years, no one style could prevail too long. No poet would face oblivion because the Yale Younger Poets man detested surrealism or despised projectivism. The award might instead contribute to the growth of diverse styles, and the Yale Press might someday print a concrete poem.


**Title: Moms**
**Page number(s): 2-3**

The Hill-Dwight MOMS Welfare Rights Organization began last August in discussions among recipients of Aid to Families of Dependent Children. The mothers soon arrived at three common conclusions: "The distinction made between children on welfare and children not on welfare is detrimental to the normal growth and development of our children." The welfare system does not treat them equally, nor are any of them up to the state's own minimum standard. They saw that only as a group could they hope to win their demands.

The mothers appointed a committee to investigate back-to-school clothing standards, and a Christmas committee. These committees went from the caseworkers to Miss Perry the assistant district director, to her superior Mrs. Schean, to her superior Mr. Ely receiving a collection of denials of power, contradictory policy statements and outright "no"s.

The MOMS decided to bring a larger group of mothers to meet with the welfare department and the social workers. On Tuesday, November 5, Election Day, the MOMS entered the large room of the welfare office on Bassett Street. They were invited to the conference room, and accepted on condition that they could return if they failed to get satisfactory enforcement of the legal State minimum standards.

When the MOMS returned to the large room where the social workers interview clients, 28 were arrested. They face six-month jail sentences (their children to be placed in foster homes) and/ or $250 fines.

Early Tuesday morning, November 26, the MOMS and other interested parties met at last with State Commissioner of Welfare Shapiro in the small basement auditorium of the Connecticut Mental Health Center. In a mixture of Biblical reference ("I am a special pleader for the poor") and liberal rhetoric ("The peaceful civil rights revolution of rising expectations of the poor must not become the violent revolution of disappointed aspirations of the disadvantaged"), Shapiro outlined his position in terms of getting his budget through the legislature. He concluded, "It is in the halls of the House that the budget is passed, and that's where we need your help."

"Mr. Shapiro, I'm Claudie May Kelley. I'm a grandmother and a great-grandmother. I'm trying to raise seven kids with one pair of pants a year."

"Our rule represents a minimum standard. On that standard the legislature gives us $215 million. We fought for that open-ended budget (in 40 states they give you the money and that's it) ... "

"Trouble is I didn't get it. I got eighty-one dollars and fifty cents-to raise seven kids. Their mother's dead; their father's in the gutter somewhere. I got $6 to buy a raincoat and $3 for a pair of boots for one six-year-old boy. I don't know where you found those prices."

Mrs. Marie Harris: "We're not even up to your minimum standards."

Shapiro: "Any person with a request should bring it to a caseworker."

Mrs. Harris: "When the Hill-Dwight MOMS went to the department, our checks were held up. Mothers not in our group got clothing without even asking. Why not bring us up to your standard?"

Shapiro: "When the legislature speaks, it speaks for the whole community. When the Waterbury mothers asked for five pairs of pants, it got into the papers, and I got letters from one man who said he was a sub-executive in a big company. He worked real hard and he said he only had three pairs of pants for his son."

"Mr. Shapiro, I got nothing. Last summer I asked my social worker for sheets and pillow-cases. She said, 'I'll get around to you when I get around to you and you'll just have to wait.' I think that's very rude of her."

"Every week I visit a different district, like I been in Middletown and Stamford last week. And everywhere I say, 'Serving the poor is a privilege, and one of the most important things is to have heart.' "

Mrs. Kelly: "Mr. Shapiro, I'm beggin you."

Audience: "Don't beg."
