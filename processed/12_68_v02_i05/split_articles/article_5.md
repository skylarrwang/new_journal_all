ponents, were uppermost in Malraux's 
mind: he too had had two brothers perish 
in the Resistance, his two sons accidental-
ly killed. The Chinese leader does not 
appear in these pages as a dictator and a 
propagandist. CalmJy, be states the basis 
of his grievances against America, his 
hopes in his people, but also the colossal 
obstacles in front of him. He too is a poet, 
an intellectual who bas risen from the 
anonymous peasantry. But he is not exul-tant and haughty. He is desperately alone. 
Twice the phrase comes to Mao's lips: "I 
am alone, with the masses." Misereor 
super duces: I take pity upon all leaders, 
Malraux's fictional heroes had already 
seemed to say, echoing Christ's sadness. 
Three themes recur throughout Anti-
memoirs, which refuse and spurn banal 
confessions, self-justification, boastfulness 
and the claim to sincerity. Man and his-
tory: perpetually the past is there, inform-
ing the present, giving density, continuity, 
meaningfulness to life. That past must be 
transcended, but first it must be absorbed 
and re-lived. As for Michelet and for 
Nietzsche, history is a reminder to man 
that be can leap forward and change life, 
never a sterile memento mori. 

Man and art is the second theme. Mal-
raux perceives, grasps the concrete vivid-
ness of landscapes, objects, people with an 
eagle's eyes. His best sentences are as 
sharply outlined and definitive as any in 
Tacitus. But it is in museums, in shops of 
antique merchants, in sculpture of the past 
that he reads the secrets of a civiliaztion, 
that the pulse of a nation beats. Art alone, 
in his famous formula, is a victory against 
man's fate, a triumph over all our fatali-
ties, an assertion that all is not sound and 
fury nor life a tale told by an idiot. 

But a third word is the key word of 
Anti-memoirs, repeated hundreds of times; 
one theme pervades all the chapters, and 
that is "death." Malraux's father, his 
grandfather also, bad committed suicide. 
His father, a few days before taking his 
own life, had confessed to him that death 
inspired him with an intense curiosity. 
The three greatest scenes in this volume, 
which are no longer conversations, but un-
systematic or restrained and disconnected 
records of lived action, are Malraux's near 
encounters with death. While perilously 
flying over Arabia when he attempted to 
photograph the ruins of the Queen of 
Sheba's palace, his plane ran short of 
fuel, struggled against a tornado and mi-
raculously landed safely. In 1940, while 
serving in the tank corps, Malraux and his 
crew were engulfed in a deep hollow in 
which German artillery was to bombard 
them; again, he escaped with his life, was 
taken prisoner of war, thrown into the 
cathedral of Sens with hundreds of other 
prisoners and finally fted to the unoc-
cupied zone of France. The third time, in 
1944, while a colonel in the Resistance, 
he was arrested by the Germans, wounded, 
almost shot by a firing squad. His papers 
had been mistaken by the Gestapo for 
those of his brother; his torture was de-
layed a few days. Then the Germans fled 
from Toulouse, and the liberated prisoners 
acclaimed Malraux as their leader. As 
he lay in the infirmary of the prison, be re-
quested one book from the nun who 
attended to his wounds: the Gospel of St. 
John. 

Yet be refuses faith and Christianity. 
Like Camus, he believes that agoomcs to-
day have ravished the tragic sense of life 
and anguish from orthodox religion; that 
they can best live up to what one of the 
characters in The Conquerers, almost 
forty years ago, had already declared: "It 
is not in order to die that I think of death 
obsessively, but in order to live." Any 
civilization is, overtly or covertly, haunted 
by what it thinks of death. Only thus can 
it create. Man is the only animal which 
knows that it must die. He imagines, cre-
ates and fights against the gods, a tragic 
hero. "Any faith," writes Malraux, "dis-
solves life into the eternal, and I was am-
putated from the eternal." 

Malraux once, in a famous interview 
given while he was fighting on the Alsa-
tian front, declared that he (like Bema-
nos, Giono and, he might have added later, 
Sartre and Camus) stands in a tradition 
which goes back to Corneille and to Pas-
cal, which is heroic, Jansenist and J acobin. 
He is indeed one of the classics of Euro-
pean literature, and years ago, while Pom-
pidou was still a lycee teacher, he com-
piled a small volume of extracts from 
Malraux in which be suggested topics for 
student essays. The first one was a fine 
sentence: "An intellectual is not only he 
to whom books are a necessity, but any 
man whose life is ordered by an idea, how-
ever simple it may be." Pompidou, Mal-
raux, De Gaulle himself, Adenauer lately, 
Wilson in Britain, McCarthy and Steven-
son before him in America, Mao and Ho 
Chi Minh and not a few of the other lead-
ers of our time are indeed, or have been, 
intellectuals courageous enough to act on 
their ideas and on their faith, imaginative 
enough to prepare action by meditation 
and thought.
