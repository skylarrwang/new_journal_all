EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
To the Editors,

After the Fire (TN], September 9, 1988) presented some major problems to me as a member of the Coalition Against Apartheid (CAA). These include inaccuracies in the article's accounts of this past summer as well as a lack of examination of the administration's strategy toward CAA. 

But most important, the subject of the article- CAA and its activities this summer- is not the reason for renewed involvement in anti-apartheid work. The issue of Yale's continued financial support for the racist Pretoria regime remains the catalyst for student and community activism. 

To understand the events of the summer one has to look at the overwhelming support and diversity of larger community participation after the shanty-burning. Such involvement forced the administration to review its policy toward CAA in an attempt to find new ways to tolerate this overwhelming display of New Haven community solidarity. 

For example, permission to build the wall on Beinecke Plaza was never sought from the Yale administration, despite the article's implication that it was .. \Yellington's public grant of perm1ss1on after the erection of the wall was part of a concerted strategy by the administration to appear as a benevolent, paternalistic institution to Yale students and the larger community. 

This paternalistic image is directly refuted by that which the memorial wall represents: Yale's financial interests in profits from apartheid. 

Furthermore, contrary to some statements in the article, the membership of CAA this summer was tremendously diverse. While the criticisms of those who did not take part this summer may have been legitimate last year, the recent multi-racial support from New Haven has revitalized CAA's commitment to leadership from a cross-section of Yale and New Haven, black and white. 

Sincerely, 
Walter C. Nicolai


**Chants of a Lifetime**
**Author: Margo Schlanger**

A slow, chanted Latin mass plays over the speakers of the Yale Collection of Historical Sound Recordings (HSR) in Sterling Memorial Library. The voices echo off the gothic windows and ceiling of the room. Stopwatch in hand, Father Jerry Weber nods his head at the end of the chant and writes down the performance time in his notebook. He has probably listened to more Gregorian chants than anyone else alive. 

HSR is one of Weber's final stops as he nears the end of a 16-year project- the first comprehensive index to recordings of Gregorian chant, which was once the primary music of Catholic liturgy. The index will run over 700 pages and be bought by record libraries in the United States and abroad. 

Weber's search for chant recordings has led him to major record archives throughout the world. 

The Yale archive includes recordings that Weber has not been able to find elsewhere. These are drawn from the collection's 120,000 items, which overflow from the shelves and block the arched windows. HSR houses over 75 percent of everything recorded before 1925, and its particular strengths include American musical theatre, public speaking, jazz, and operatic vocal recording. 

Weber is interested in several rare chant recordings from the 1930's and early 1940's. 

Weber's catalogue, known as a discography, will serve as a finder!>' guide for Gregorian chant recordings. He will index each record by choir, text, and recording company and will also note the performance time, location, and date. Most important, he will include the record number, faintly etched or stamped into the vinyl just outside the label. This number is the only firm identification a record has. 

The chant discography combines Weber's several occupations. "My interest is as a priest, as a musician, and as a discographer," he explained. In 1952, Weber saw a discography and "really got hooked on record numbers." Fifteen years later he published his first monograph, on Schubert lieder. Since then he's compiled 18 similar catalogues, one of which is· used as a discography textbook at the University of California at Santa Barbara. Weber's current project is different, not only because of his lifelong involvement in chant, but because of its great length. "It's obviously close to my heart," he said. "That's why I left it until I had been doing discographies for 20 years." 

With the end of his research in sight, Weber looks forward to sending the work to press this spring. "I think I can do it the right way," he said, leaning back in his chair and clicking his stopwatch as yet another record begins.
