Coach Young tells the runners: 
"You go to class. I get paid to 
worry." 
Women athletes are particularly 
concerned about injury. "You get to a 
point when you are running 60 or 70 
miles per week, and your bodies break 
down, particularly women's," Young 
explains. Medical researchers have 
only partial answers for women's 
greater susceptibility to InJUry as 
compared to men's. Intensive exercise 
can lead to lower estrogen levels, which 
can cause stress fractures and the bone 
d isease osteoperosis. Women's wider 
hips put greater pressure on joints,~ . 
especially 
the 
knees. 
The pool 
workouts have made these localized 
health concerns far less prominent for 
the team. 

The women have more generalized 
health concerns as well. Many of these 
athletes don't menstruate, a condition 
called amenorrhea. Those who do get 
their period often have irregular 
cycles. The runners may lack the 
necessary body weight for normal 
menstruation; 
inadequate nutrition 
combined with rigorous exercise can 
also play a role. 

Many doctors believe it is dangerous 
if women do not shed the uterine lining 
every three months. Some members of 
the team have never gotten their 
periods because they were running 
throughout adolescence, and these 
women could risk infertility. A few of 
the athletes decided to go on the Pill to 
induce a regular cycle. But most of 
them have stopped, uncomfortable 
with taking artificial hormones. 

Anemia, or iron deficiency, has also 
been a problem for the team in the 
past, keeping last year's captain from
competition for a month-and-a-half. 
Long-distance running causes slight 
but steady gastro-intestinal bleeding, 
which partially explains the prevalence 
of anemia in both men and women run-
ners. Now all team members are tested 
at the beginning of the season and take 
iron supplements if necessary. The 
cross country teams are the only ones 
at Yale to receive blood tests as a 
group. 

The group members help each other 
deal with these problems. But the 
health issue that comes up more than 
any other is weight. H ow much the 
runners weigh, whether they are too 
heavy or too thin, what kind of food is 
good for them, how little someone is 
eating- these are all topics the women 
say never really leave their conver-
sation. The typical body type on the 
team is thin. Some of the runners are 
even skinny. Whereas athletes say that 
weight that doesn't work for them 
works against them, a few team mem-
bers feel this philosophy can go too far. 
At times the team's group dynamics 
have wor:ked against the runners by 
setting a low body weight as the 
standard. 

Sarah E. Smith (ES '91) noticed this 
standard as soon as she joined the team 
her freshman year. "I came here, and I 
thought I was the heaviest person on 
the team because everyone was just so 
thin," she says. To distinguish between 
Sarah E. Smith and the captain, Sarah 
P. Smith, teammates call them "the 
younger Sarah" and "Sarah, the elder.~ 
Last year the younger Sarah set a 
course record as the fastest freshman in 
the league and has now moved in to the 
top four. Although she hasn't lost 
weight to fit in with the team, she still 
feels self-conscious around the others. 
"I still look at myself, compare, and 
think 'If you lost weight, you would be 
a better runner,"' she says. 

For some of her teammates, keeping 
weight on is a problem. Each hour of 
running burns around 1,000 calories 
more than what the average person 
uses in the course of a day. To 
compensate becomes a difficult task 
when team members try to stay vege-
tarian and eat healthful foods from the 
dining hall. Young encourages the 
runners to eat a lot, to make up for the 
calorie-loss, but he realizes that he has 
little .influence. 

There are many 
aspects of the team that he can't 
affect. "People are going to have to get 
that lab done, they are going to have to 
get that paper in, and they are going to 
pull all-nighters. They are going to be 
emotionally drained and strained as 
well as physically drained and strained 
and doing that on top of training. 
T hose are the things I don't have any 
control over," Young says. "So what I 
do is have nightmares about it." 

Team members' weight is not only a 
problem Young can't solve, it is also 
one of the most important concerns for 
the team. Young realizes that control-
ling weight falls somewhere between 
discipline and obsession for many 
runners. The easy description would 
be anorexia nervosa, 
an eating 
disorder that is a documented disease 
for many long-distance runners. And 
in the past, some team members have 
been diagnosed with the disorder. One 
woman was pulled from competition 
because she weighed under 95 pounds 
-a high figure compared to the 88 
pounds she had weighed earlier that 
year. But Young warns against taking 
severe examples like this as the rule. 
"Anybody who sees somebody as thin, 
there's a popular tendency to label that 
as anorexic. There have only been a 
couple of people who actually fit the 
definition of anorexia," he says. 

If a runner does have an eating 
disorder, then Young steps in with help 
from University Health Services. The 
anorectic is assigned a "weight doctor" 
who monitors the athlete's progress 
towards a healthy weight. A runner 
identified with a problem now must 
consistently come in at 100 pounds to 
be allowed to race, regardless of height 
and build. Dr. Jane Rasmussen, chief 
of student medicine, who set the level, 
says the 100-pound standard must be 
the very minimum. By scheduling 
weigh-ins anywhere from once a week 
to daily, she has had success in getting 
anorexic runners to attain a safe 
weight. 

But the solution to serious weight 
problems goes beyond a balanced diet 
and following doctors' advice. There is 
a psychological motivation that keeps 
some runners both exercising and 
starving themselves. "I don't think it 
has anything definitely to do with 
running, but I think there is a type of 
personality-you want to excel, you 
want to be noticed," Rivkin says. 

Perini agrees that extreme thinness 
stems from other problems, but she 
sees running as conducive to obses-
siveness. She has the most solid build 
on the team, which at most means she 
has broad shoulders. Perini feels that 
her body type can help off-set the thin 
image of the team. "I feel like I can set 
an example," she says. "I am bigger 
than a lot of the girls on the team, and 
I think I can prove- if I start running 
well- than you can be pretty big and 
still run well."
