list. A successful insurgency would need 
the votes and financial support of white 
liberals, developers, Hispanics, three or 
four middle class white wards, and 
about 85 percent of the registered black 
voters. In order to come even close, 
Daniels has to run a cautious campaign. 
According to Rae, "He can't run a racial 
campaign and make it work. He can't 
run a radical campaign and live with his 
past record." He can run on a critique 
of DiLieto's development policies, 
perhaps with a theme like "People Not 
Places." 

The young black politicians who 
worked with Tyson could play an im-
portant role in· Daniels' campaign. They 
will probably lend him their help, but it 
would be erroneous to assume that the 
black community will automatically 
support a black candidate. In the 1987 
mayoral race in New Haven, more 
blacks voted for DiLieto than for his 
black opponent, Bill Jones. Even if 
blacks don't vote against Daniels, they 
could seriously damage his election 
prospects by not voting at all. 

Low black voter turnout could be the 
most likely scenario. From the bottom 
looking up, impoverished blacks see a 
monolithic machine. "For most of them, 
they think the black leadership in New 
Haven is bankrupt. They don't think 
this leadership can change the reality of 
their day-to-day existence," Sullivan 
said. From the top gazing down, the 
machine looks fragile. That seems to be 
why the Democratic leadership felt 
threatened by a black woman as Regis-
trar of Voters. While the machine tries 
to retain control, Daniels is preparing 
for an upcoming campaign, and Tyson 
is busy registering more people to vote.
