Young builds conljdcnce 
rather than 
competitiveness by 
assigning a leader for each mile·, whom 
no one may pass. This strategy has 
worked. The only athlctcs to b<"al Yale 
in tbe national meet last year came 
from schools ttiat recruit with sizable 
athletic scholarships. The runners' 
group effort has developed their skill 
and pro,·ided them with support.

group. Ranked by recruiters as one of 
the top high school distance runners in 
the nation, she received a lot of 
attention from colleges where students, 
as she puts it, run for a salary. But she 
did not want to compete for a school 
that demanded its investment pay off. 
Beck chose Yale, expecting to excel on 
the team. Although she considered 
Young the best coach in the Ivy 
League, she had no idea of the strength 
of Yale's runners. And if she had, Beck 
probably wouldn't have come. "It was a 
real surprise to get here and not be 
number one on the team, because I 
just figured that Yale is an Ivy League 
school- they don't really take their 
sports seriously," she says. 
Beck 
became one of the team's top four 
runners, but not the decided leader. 
. After a year of competing, Beck 
began to fit in. "If you come into the 
team with a competitive attitude, you 
are going to be stewing in your own 
juices because there is no one to 
compete against," she says. "It doesn't 
occur to anyone to be competitive 
because it is such a waste of time to be 
competitive with people you spend two 
hours every day with." Although 
occasionally she still feels a little out of

place as the only Literature major 
among many pre-meds, she says it is 
only because conversation during long-
distance runs can be like biology 
sections. Beck says she now views 
racing as something required in order 
to keep training with the team. 

The training is what brings the 
women together-often up to three 
hours a day. The runners' success has 
depended on the regular practice of 
their sport and on the unique training 
program, incorporating a special pool 
workout that serves as a model for 
other schools. After building up their 
mileage over the summer, the athletes 
start the year with 45-50 miles of 
running a week. They run eight miles 
two of those days. In between these 
distance runs, they have pool workouts 
at 8:00 in the morning and interval 
workouts- short, 
fast bouts of 
running- in the afternoon. All this 
prepares the runners for Friday meets. 
On Saturdays, even after a competi-
tion, the athletes run 10-12 miles, and 
every other Sunday is a light day of 3-5 
miles. Weight lifting is optional. 
Kristin Perini (ES '90) works well 
under this system. She transferred to 
Yale last semester from Harvard and 
"Running is not a 
feminine thing to do. 
You go out and you 
sweat and you build 
muscle instead of fat 
in nice places." 
may provide the team with the strong 
fifth runner it lacks. In cross country 
meets, only the first five finishers 
score. Although Yale has four powerful 
runners, it needs a fifth. This season 
marks Perini's 
first cross country 
racing in two-and-a-half years. She 
was the number one distance recruit 
from high school, but burned out on 
running and quit Harvard's team the 
end of her sophomore year. Now. after 
time off and a new school, she has 
joined Yale's team and has regained 
interest in running. "I've never been on 
a team that is so supportive of one 
another," Perini says. At Harvard, the 
coach never let the top runners develop 
into a team and pushed them to the 
point of injury-running up to 20 
miles even the day after a meet. Perini 
spent most of her two years injured. 
Still nursing running injuries and a 
summer-long lung infection, she is 
having a frustrating recovery. Slowly, 
she has improved her running times. 
But this cross country season might 
be her last: She may be disqualfied 
next season for exceeding a five-year 
limit on enrollment as an under-
graduate. 
Coach Young calls · Perini the 


hardest worker on the team. Long-
distance 
runners are notoriously 
dedicated, and their intensity 
sometimes makes them push too hard. 
If anything, one of Young's most 
crucial 
roles is 
to temper 
team 
members' zeal. "If someone wanted to 
run more miles, Mark probably would 
not let 
them," Smith says. 
"It's 
important that you put those-limits on 
someone who is a distance runner 
because you can become compulsive 
about it. It's very easy to think more is 
better, but what happens is that you 
just destroy yourself." Young keeps in 
close touch with the runners and alters 
the practice schedule if they are 
injured. 

Rebecca Rivkin (ES '90) appreciates 
Young's conscientious coaching style. "I 
really feel guilty if I miss a workout 
because that's the way I am. I feel like I 
always have to be there for the team, 
be there for myself. But sometimes if 
you're not feeling well, he's not the type 
of coach that says, 'Even if it hurts, run 
through it.' He's the opposite," Rivkin 
says. When Rivkin was injured last 
winter, she worked out in the pool 
twice a day and didn't run on the roads 
at all. When she returned to racing, 
Susanna Beck and Rebecca Rivkin 
she felt even stronger than before. Her 
performance qualified her for the 
Olympic trials in 
a long-distance 
event. 

The team's pool workouts mean that 
the runners can train less on the road 
than most cross country athletes. In 
the pool, the women still run- without 
touching the bottom. Then, holding 
onto a rope, they do intervals. Young 
estimates that each session in the pool 
adds five to seven miles to the total 
weekly distance without adding those 
miles in road-impact. This practice has 
created a marked decrease in injuries 
for the team. The Yale women's cross 
country team is one of the first in the 
country to use pool exercise. 

Young started the pool program in 
1984, his fifth year coaching. Two of 
his athletes had severe stress fractures , 
and he decided to experiment with an 
exercise regimen in the pool to help 
them stay in shape. When one of those 
women set her best time in a track 
meet with only a few weeks of road 
'training foliowing her recovery, Young 
immediately started all the long-
distance runners on morning water 
workouts. Since then he has seen far 
fewer injuries from overuse.
