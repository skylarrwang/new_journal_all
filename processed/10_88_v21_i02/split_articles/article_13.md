EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Often concerns about a runner's 
weight get aired among the team 
members. That's why last fall, a few of 
the athletes started to worry about the 
current captain. Sarah P. Smith had 
unintentionally dropped ten pounds 
over the course of the season, just 
because she was trying to stick to 
healthy foods. "Sometimes I get so 
wrapped up in the season and I don't 
realize it, and I then step on a scale and 
it's a shock. It's like, 'Oh, my God, I 
thought I was eating, but I guess I 
wasn't.' And that just shouldn't 
happen. It's not like I have that much 
to lose." She knows she is below a 
natural weight for non-runners, but is 
pleased to have gained back the ten 
pounds. 

All the runners on the team share a 
common image as women athletes. 
"For a man to be an athlete, you are 
working toward the ideal body image 
or the ideal image of what a man 
should be," 
Captain Smith says. 
"When you're a woman athlete, you're 
going against the social ideal of what a 
woman should be. I know that I don't 
look very womanly. Running is not a 
feminine thing to do. You go out and 
you sweat and you exert yourself and 
you build muscle instead of fat in nice 
places." Their sense of identity as 
women brings them together not only 
as teammates but also during 
competitions. "You're not just running 
for yourself. You're running for your 
team. You're all out there together, 
you're breathing hard, you're all going 
through the same pain. And you know 
that if your teammate during a race is 
going to go through that, then you 
can," Rivkin says. At the team's first 
meet, the women ran in a tight group. 
Rebecca Rivkin fell twice, but her 
teammates waited for her to recover. 
They slowed their own times to include 
her in their finish. Kristin Perini 
struggled but ended with a pretty good 
time. Warm-down was several more 
miles of running.
