Few people noticed the closing of the 
West Haven landfill last spring until 
debris ended up in front of their houses. 
Junked cars were everywhere-600 
decaying on the streets of New Haven 
alone. Lois Davis, a resident of the Hill 
neighborhood, frequently complained 
to the police about the rusting hulls 
piling up near her home. "It was a real 
eyesore-just disgusting," she said. But 
the cars remained all summer. There 
was no place else for them to go. 
Michael Schiavone and Sons, Inc., the 
only major car-shredder in the state, 
normally would shred abandoned cars 
and then dump the fluffy interiors in the 
West Haven landfill. But when the 
dump closed, the business came to a 
halt. No other landfill operators wanted 
to accept the bulky fluff, estimated at 
20,000 tons a year. 

Landfill space has become precious in 
Connecticut, where 44 dumps have 
already reached capacity. Only two new 
landfills have been approved in the last 
ten years. But nowhere is the bur-
geoning garbage crisis more evident 
than in New Haven. With the closing of 
the West Haven dump, New Haven's 
Middletown 
Avenue landfill must 
absorb an additional 400 tons of 
g~rbage a week, limiting the life of the 
ctty dump to only one more year. On 
t?p of this problem, the neighboring 
City of Stratford has abandoned plans 
for an incinerator that would have 
burned 60 percent of New Haven's 
waste. Now, New Haven residents are 
confronting a trash nightmare: the 
prospect of thousands of tons of solid 
waste with no place to go. 

Dwindling space is not the only issue 
confronting those dependent on the 
landfill. A dump may look like an inert 
pile of rubbish, but eyen everyday gar-
bage such as an old magazine or a 
plastic wrapper contains heavy metals 
and toxic compounds. When it rains on 
these materials, the chemicals can leak 
into the ground and contaminate the 
water supply. This problem is especially 
significant in Connecticut, where 32 
percent of the residents rely on ground-
water. Because of the health hazards, 
the state is reluctant to create new 
dumps. 

With existing landfills almost full, 
administrators must search for new 
technologies. Incineration is a method 
of disposal that many municipalities 
find increasingly attractive. Garbage-
burning facilities, 
called 
resource 
recovery or trash-to-energy plants, can 
handle enormous quant1t1es of waste. 
Although the plants are costly, they 
generate electricity through steam as 
they burn garbage. Over the past ten 
years, as landfills have closed, Con-
necticut has invested in more resource 
recovery than any other state. Seventy-
five percent of the state's garbage is 
committed to eight trash-to-energy 
plants currently operating or under 
construction. But the state wants even 
more, including one in the New Haven 
area. 

Communities, however, are 
reluctant to host the trash-burning 
facilities. 
Many residents fear air 
pollution from chemicals emitted in the 
burning process. Smokestack emissions 
from plants built in the past have 
included everything from acid gases to 
dangerous organic compounds. Per-
haps most frightening are dioxins: Tests 
have shown them to be carcinogenic 
and extremely toxic. Another poten-
tially 
hazardous component of 
incineration is the ash, which like 
unburned garbage, contains heavy 
metals that can enter groundwater. 

In 1982, New Haven began plarming 
a 
trash-to-energy facility near its 
harbor, in Fair Haven. But local citizen 
groups, worried about 
the dioxin 
threat, waged a highly vocal war against 
the proposal. Their concerns were not 
without warrant: In 1977, the state 
closed a 13-year old incinerator in New 
Haven because stack emissions violated 
air quality standards. Reacting to the 
Fair Haven protests, the city aban-
doned the plan two years ago. 

The defeat took the city admini-
stration 
completely 
by surprise, 
according to J ohn Hamilton, a member 
of Don't Dump On Us. His group was 
the main force behind the Fair Haven 
protest. "It blew their shorts off," he 
said. Hamilton believes that incin-
erators, despite their health risks, are 
often planned for crowded cities like 
New Haven and Stratford because 
the high numbers of poor residents give 
those cities little political power. "They 
don't expect one unified voice from 
places like Fair Haven, but with this 
issue, people hit the streets," Hamilton 
said. Opposition continues to gain 
force. This past summer, Stratford 
residents overthrew plans for an incin-
erator in their area. 

The not-in-my-backyard syndrome 
has grown so severe that Connecticut 
legislators are considering aggressive 
ways to get plants built. One plan is to 
subsidize communities that agree to 
host an incinerator. More coercive, and 
more controversial, is a bill that would 
give the state power to override a com-
munity's refusal to accept a plant. If the
bill passes in the next state senate 
session, the Connecticut Department of 
Environmental Protection (DEP) can 
build facilities wherever it wants, and 
thereby protect its considerable invest-
ment in resource recovery. 

Proponents of incineration argue that 
the technology is improving every day 
and that burning is a relatively safe and 
convenient way to treat waste. "The 
dioxin controversy is totally out of 
proportion," said Roger Koontz, a 
Hartford 
attorney 
specializing in 
energy issues. "No one really knows 
what levels of dioxin in the air exist. It's 
not likely the small amount from the 
plants is going to be a health hazard. 
Connecticut has very strict [safety] 
levels." The ash can be managed safely, 
Koontz said, in special landfills with 
double 
linings and complex 
filter 
systems to avoid groundwater contam-
ination. 

But many New Haven activists be-
lieve the need for incineration can be 
bypassed altogether through recy-
cling, a safe and cheap technology. A 
report prepared by Don't Dump On Us 
argued that recycling could eliminate as 
much as 70 percent of New Haven's 
stream of waste. But recycling is a 
relatively new and alien concept in 
American waste management, and one 
not easily embraced by administrators. 
While waste managers generally main-
tain that incineration and recycling can 
work together, environmentalists in 
New Haven think recycling will never 
get a fair chance if incineration moves 
next door. "The state's [commitment to 
incineration] seems to put a ceiling on 
recycling," said Suzanne Mattei, 
director of the New Haven-based 
organization, Connecticut Fund For 
the Environment. "We built the plants 
before we knew how much we could re-
cycle." But she says it is not too late for 
New Haven to break out of the burn 
mentality. "I am more and more be-
lieving that it is possible to reduce waste 
enough through recycling that we don't 
have to incinerate." 

Hamilton believes that many bureau-
crats prefer incineration because it is 
easier to implement than recycling. He 
points out that city adminstrators would 
prefer to work through established 
channels. "They'd love to have a way to 
solve this in a two-hour appointment 
with a banker and an engineer," he 
said . 
Recycling, 
however, requires 
grass-roots organization. "It's messy.
