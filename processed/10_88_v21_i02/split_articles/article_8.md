You have to deal with people. John 
DeStefano doesn't have time," he said of 
New 
Have~'s Chief Administrative 
Officer. 

But John DeStefano has reacted to 
pressure from local recycling activists, 
as well as from DEP, which last year 
required that cities recycle 25 percent of 
their garbage by 1991. Spurred on by 
both fronts, DeStefano and members of 
the newly formed Solid Waste Man-
agement Commission spent the sum-
mer fine-tuning a program that will 
gradually introduce the recycling ethic 
to New Haven. The first component of 
the program involves installing volun-
tary drop-ofT centers with igloo-shaped, 
color-coded receptacles for collecting 
newspapers, bottles, and cans. Next is 
an experiment with collecting sorted 
recyclables from private homes in a 
target neighborhood. The city has also 
begun its own office paper recycling 
program, using recycled paper in two 
municipal buildings. And a govern-
ment council is currently reviewing 
proposals for a regional recycling plant 
that would clean and prepare materials 
for reuse. If the New Haven program is 
successful, it will be the most extensive 
in Connecticut. But now, a year after 
the campaign was announced, the city 
has yet to collect a single bottle. 

Critics of DeStefano's program such 
as Vincent Marottoli, a citizen serving 
on the solid waste commission, feel the 
city is not moving fast enough. "Is this a 
garbage crisis? Yes, and I don't see the 
kind of action we should be showing for 
a crisis." 

DeStefano and his staff say the pro-
cess is necessarily a slow one. A 
recycling campaign aimed at the entire 
city is.a monumental task, they say. To 
educate people about recycling, the city 
needs across-the-board advertising in 
newspapers, on television, through 
direct mail, and possibly in inserts with 
gas or telephone company bills. Mem-
bers of the commission feel such a 
broad-based advertising campaign is 
especially important in New H aven, 
where illiteracy is so pervasive. The city 
will probably hire a communications 
specialist to handle these concerns. 

New H aven's widespread poverty 
may also pose a difficulty for recycling 
coordinators. To motivate recycling, 
the city must first prove itself worthy of 
the effort. Solid waste coordinator Sue 
W eisselberg says that before the formal 
education campaign begins, the city 
must be cleaned up. She believes that 
people will recycle only if they feel that a 
clean city improves their quality of life. 
"It's an incremental process," she said. 
"This is not a suburban community of 
the white, middle class," DeStefano 
added. "We have all the challenges of an 
urban area." 

But some critics wonder if the 
administration's agenda will really meet 
those challenges. Community activist 
Hamilton thinks that the city's hesi-
tation in recycling is an expression of 
racism and self-protection. "The city 
thinks poor people, black people won't 
recycle." In fact, he said, they won't 
recycle only so long as N~w H aven continues to ignore their needs. If New 
H aven's priorities remain office space 
and condominium development rather 
than education and low-income 
housing, 
people won't care about 
recycling, Hamilton said. "In order for 
people to recycle, they need to feel 
invested and empowered in the com-
munity, a part of society." Only when 
the city realizes the extent of reciprocity 
required will municipal attitudes 
change. "For me, 
that's exciting. 
(R ecycling] has the potential to make 
major social concessions."
