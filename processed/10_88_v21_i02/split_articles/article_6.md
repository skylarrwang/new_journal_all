The Coalition Against Apartheid (CAA), for example, has taken an uncompromising stand for divestiture of University funds that support companies with ties to South Africa. For others, divestiture is a complex, ambiguous issue. Although everyone is against apartheid, the best course for freeing blacks in South Africa is widely debated. But three years ago during the rallies on Beinecke Plaza the jssue was as clear as the protestors' collective conscience: To be against divestiture was to be for Botha's South Africa. For CAA members, there was, and is, no acceptance of differing opinions on this issue. Someone is either morally right or wrong.


Classrooms often reinforce these liberal assumptions. In lectures, many professors seem to have a quota of Reagan jokes they must tell. In discussion sections, the prevailing attitude reflects the same easy liberalism. Freshman year I went to a class section on Multinational Corporations (MNC's). Having read the week's material, I took the view that MNC's, although at times corrupt and rapacious, had generally helped their host countries. I was also prepared to discuss the problems that past MNC's had caused. Coming to the section with little ideology, I was surprised by the impression held by the other students that MNC's are inherently bad. My arguments to the contrary were politely ignored. I wasn't seeking consensus on my views, but did assume that the class would at least consider a different perspective.


But there does exist an organization devoted to student debate, the Political Union (PU). Recently, however, the PU has veered away from debate meetings on the grounds that members wouldn't attend. The Liberal Party feels that the absence of its members would lead to a domination by the parties on the right, which tend to favor more debate. The Liberals fear that their less interested members would prefer to hear other viewpoints than express their own; they consistently vote for a speaker rather than for a debate.


In reaction, the conservative parties· in the PU portray themselves as defenders of debate and the exchange of ideas. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Party of the Right's (POR) stated aims are to encourage free debate and to be a haven for those with · radical views of any political stripe. But it spends most of its time opposing what it perceives as the campus orthodoxy. This ten· dency results in scoffing at all that is not reactionary Republican or highly philosophical, and to a moral arrogance that has little room for people outside their club.


Feeling embattled by the liberal majority, conservative parties make trouble or recede into safe, like-thinking groups. The POR, . for example, insists that the PU observe the rule that requires male members to wear a coat and tie in order to be recognized by the speaker. Although the rule is suspended each semester, the POR returns to this empty issue just to antagonize liberals. But these actions not only annoy those on the left, they make the debate that the POR supposedly cherishes even more acrimonious. Instead of disrupting the liberal hegemony of the PU, the POR merely tinkers with the rules and procedures.


The other party on the right that could offer some hope is the Tory Party. Tories pride themselves on their oratorical skills, and many of their debates are quite interesting. But the Tory members prefer to be insular and do little to change people's political thinking. The end result is a small contribution to Yale's political discourse.


But there is a future for political debate on campus. Last year during the primary season students strongly supported disparate candidates for president. For the first time in four years, liberals had a chance to be for someone instead of against Ronald Reagan. The liberal political establishment, including the College Democrats who otherwise contribute little to campus issues, fought over Gore, Simon, Dukakis, and Jackson. To hear from those on the left that there were some problems in the Democratic party was refreshing.


There was a similar opening up on the Republican side. As Co-chairman of Students for Dole in Connecticut, I was involved in getting Yale students to help with voter registration and go door-to-door both here and in New Hampshire. Many members of the Dole campaign considered themselves moderates who had avoided Yale politics because of the disappointing campus atmosphere. This campaign was their first political activity at Yale. They were heartened to find a fair amount of Democrats who respected Dole and who would consider voting for him if they did not like the Democratic nominee. A small step towards opening a meaningful political dialogue, but important nonetheless.


It is too much to expect of any person not to pursue party loyalties right before a presidential election -the issues seem too clear for both sides. The rhetoric on campus will be strong in the coming weeks. After the election, however, there may be a chance to begin anew. A change in Presidential administrations brings in new plans and ideas no matter how vacuous the campaign has been. If people would examine their beliefs in a new political climate, discussion could, and should, flourish at Yale.
