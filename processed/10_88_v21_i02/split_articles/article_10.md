**Freddy Fixer and Rainbow Recycling**

Freddy Fixer would then seU the ma-
terials to major recycling plants. The 
idea has grown so popular that this faU 
he switched to a bigger truck, now 
servicing 170 households and a number 
of small businesses. The New Haven 
Independent has heralded him as a 
"recycling hero." 

"Starting this little project has had a 
galvanizing effect on the people of New 
Haven," Weinstein said. "It's given 
them an opportunity to recycle where 
they were frustrated before." In ad-
dition to making people happy, re-
cycling has huge economic potential 
"I want recycling to become a part of the 
economic fabric and not just an ethical 
thing. To do anything in our society, 
we have to change economic relations." 

Rainbow Recycling has done just that, 
saving commercial clients hundreds of 
dollars a month in dumping fees by 
carting away bulky recyclables. "This is 
a very profitable business," he added. 

But Weinstein is not in it for the 
money, in fact, he and his new partners 
hope to work themselves out of exis-
tence by turning the job over to the city. 
Their basic goal is to prove that re-
cycling can work for residences a'l weU 
as for business. Whether the city 
will take their success as proof remains 
uncertain. 

In the meantime, officials are trying 
to ease the garbage crunch by keeping 
the present dump alive as long as pos-
sible. In an effort to make using the 
landfill less attractive, the city recently 
doubled the cost of dumping for com-
mercial haulers from S48 to S98 a ton. 
This increase is passed directly to 
businesses and apartment buildings, 
which are finding the idea of recycling 
more and more appealing. 

DeStefano and the solid waste com-
mission have also presented 12 or-
dinances to the Board of Aldermen. 
The most controversial of these is a total 
ban of corrugated cardboard from the 
landfill, with fines as high as S5,000 for 
violations. Cardboard takes up more


room in the dump than any other ma-
terial: Of the 525 tons of garbage 
brought to the New Haven dump every 
day, approximately 20 percent is card-
board. The ordinance, if passed, is 
expected 
to 
infuriate 
commercial 
disposal companies and may lead bus-
inesses 
to independent 
recycling. 

DeStefano's office is compiling a list of 
recycling companies that will accept the 
cardboard. Other proposed ordinances 
would prohibit residents from dumping 
bulk trash on Saturdays and create five 
"public space inspectors" to issue civil 
fines for illegal disposal. 

DeStefano expects these measures to 
prolong the life of the landfill by several 
months. The city engineer has also 
applied to DEP for a permit to expand 
the dump·, requesting ten extra vertical 
feet and a horizontal expansion of the 
south side. If DEP grants the permit, 
the life of the landfill could double to 
two years. 

Sooner or later the city will have 
to make long-term decisio.ns. While 
incineration may be easier to im-
plement from 
a 
bureaucratic per-
spective, the city would then have to 
contend with strong community resent-
ment. Recycling may be cheaper and 
safer, but it might not be effective 
without a profound alteration in urban 
conditions. However the city chooses to 
treat solid waste, it will have to weigh 
the needs of the administration against 
those of the community. In choosing 
where to build plants and what kind of 
disposal to employ, New Haven has far 
more at stake than simply where it will 
put its garbage.
