**When Right Is Incorrect**

A teacher of mine in high school had a favorite quotation that he used to say during any debate. It went something like this: "You can't fully understand your own position until you understand your opponent's." Few people follow that maxim at Yale. Liberals, from activists to once-every-four-year voters, outnumber conservatives and often seem to embrace beliefs without careful thought. Informed, reasoned debate is rare. The resulting atmosphere makes liberal attitudes the orthodoxy and puts campus conservatives on the defensive, so that they either bite back or hide for four years. 

Liberals don't perceive the differences between conservative positions. According to the liberal orthodoxy, everything on the right is wrong. Liberals take pride in their tolerant attitudes, but their understanding of tolerance has a misguided premise. Tolerance is usually defined as freedom from bigotry and acceptance of those who differ in race, sex, and sexual orientation. At Yale, however, the word has come to mean the acceptance of someone's beliefs without critical analysis. 

This definition is best exemplified by those who call themselves "politically correct," or p.c. for short. Their label gives them a ready-made set of beliefs that they can use for their own. To be p.c. is to wear the red arm band, to boycott grapes, and to know the feminist rhetoric. It is assumed by those who are p.c. that their liberal views are correct, and people who oppose those values are incorrect. 

Differing opinions stem from conflicting value systems that cannot be reconciled. And it is incorrect to try. 

But not all value systems are equal. Anything bearing conservative markings immediately receives a negative assessment. The p.c. crowd assumes that conservatives are interested in taking away people's rights and liberties, and reacts accordingly. This perception does have some validity in real-world politics. In the national arena, those on the far right, such as the Moral Majority, can be repressive and moralistic. These groups deserve the "intolerant" epithet. Unfortunately, campus liberal organizations, by creating an environment in which dissent is laughed at or scorned, fall into the same trap as the New Right. 

Yale's political discourse suffers as a result. 

Perhaps fueled by their numbers or the ease of group thinking, liberal students restrict their tolerance to issues on which they already agree. Three years ago Wayne Dick (DC '88) distributed a newsletter parodying Gay-Lesbian Awareness Days (GLAD), and the Yale College Executive Committee gave him two years' probation. The Executive Committee later revoked the sentence after Nat Hentoff of the Village Voice raised a stink about first amendment rights. 

Liberals were outraged: Leaders of the Gay-Lesbian Co-op felt that Dick's newsletter was in such poor taste and so offensive that he should have been suspended. 

The Co-op felt the situation was entirely different when they released an ambiguous poster depicting two people engaged in oral sex. The poster was explicitly designed to shock the average Yale student out of complacency. It worked, but if statements beyond the bounds of good taste are grounds for suspension, the p.oster could have been considered on par with Dick's flyer. 

The conflict over use of space at the Women's Center last spring illustrates another liberal reaction. This case involved a group of women who called themselves Women for Life, an anti-abortion group. The members petitioned to gain access to the Women's Center, claiming that they met the established criteria for entry. But the Women's Center viewed the group as anti-feminist and refused to open its doors to any organization that worked against its political agenda. 

Dean of Student Affairs Betty Trachtenberg interceded and eventually granted the group admission. 

Making use of sensitive social issues allows liberals to feel morally superior
