The Yale singing group formerly known as Untapped Potential began tapping new members this fall. The group, founded as a reaction against the exclusive Yale Council of Singing Groups, has now joined the council and entered the selection process called ~sh and tap, competing for singers wath other official groups. 

The members of Untapped Potential, n=named Out of the Blue, formed the group in 1986 immediately after rush. •It was a banding together of people who wanted to sing in a group regardless of the system," said founding rnember Laura Stanfield (CC '90). •Some people who joined had gone through rush and weren't tapped. Others started rush and stopped because they didn't like the system." 

Approximately 60 students, most of ~e~ freshmen, try out for each council sangmg group during fall rush. Fewer than one-tenth of those who rush are tapped. Many of Untapped Potential's founders considered themselves musically qualified and felt that the council groups had passed them over because they did not measure up to certain IOcia} standards .• "We wanted to show ::!::' you could sing really well outside system without the cliquish social SCene and without rush and tap," said Jon Cohen (PC '90), another of the group's founders.

But by last spring, the group had improved musically;. and its goals had shifted. "We were tired of being considered a second-rate group," said Dawn Ellis (SM '90), the group's conductor. "We felt that we'd reached our potential, so to speak, and we wanted to have more publicity and to get a chance at some of the better voices like the other groups." After a heated dispute, the majority voted to change the group's name and join the council. Several of the original members, including Cohen, dropped out in protest. This year Out of the Blue participated in all of the council's traditional rush events, including introductory jams, singing dinners, and rush meals for prospective members. 

Despite this change in identity, the group has tried to maintain a relaxed character. In an effort to reduce the social pressures of rush, the members decided not to serve alcohol to rushees. They feel that they still emphasize singing ability over ~rsonality more than other groups. "People who rushed said we were less intimidating," Ellis said. "That's the kind of atmosphere we want."-

But some original members believe that the group has betrayed its founding principles. "I don't think they have any choice but to turn into what I originally set out to oppose," Cohen said. "The new people won't remember anything about the group's origins. Because they've been added through rush and tap, they're going to feel pretty damned elitist about it." Of the 40 students who rushed Out of the Blue this year, the group tapped 11. 

. Since Out of the Blue does not have a set repertoire, these new members have the opportunity to influence the group's sound by bringing in new music. In addition, their attitudes will help set the group's tone. "I guess the mood of the group will change a little," said Rush Manager Evelyn Gilbert (DC '90). "But hopefully our diversity and the basic character will self-perpetuate." 

It is not clear exactly which aspects of its original character the group will retain. The group's very diversity has often caused division among its members, who are still at odds over how to distinguish Out of the Blue from its more established rivals.
