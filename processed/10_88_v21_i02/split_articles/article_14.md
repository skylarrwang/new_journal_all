**Title: Breaking Up the Party**

The sign outside reads "Office of 
Registrars" and to the right stands an 
automatic voting machine. Inside the 
office, Clerk-typist Sharon Ferrucci 
talks on the phone. Althea Tyson, the 
deputy registrar, files papers at her desk 
three feet away. These few feet seemed 
much greater just over a month ago 
when the two women were battling for 
the position of Democratic Registrar of 
Voters. The Democratic party passed 
over Tyson, a black woman, and nominated Ferrucci for the job-breaking a 
120-year-old tradition of handing the 
position 
to the deputy. 

Tyson 
challenged Ferrucci, an Italian, but lost 
by a small margin in the primary. The 
office seems quiet now; Ferrucci will 
take over her new post in November. 
But the fight has led to accusations that 
the Democratic party in New Haven 
excludes those who might make too 
much noise. 

Political battles in New Haven rarely 
arise between Democrats and Republicans. Ten out of eleven registered 
voters in the city are Democrats, and 
there has not been a Republican mayor 
since 1952. Instead, the conflicts arise 
within the Democratic party: between 
its liberals and its conservatives, the 
developers and the slow-growth advocates, and the Irish and the Italians. 
Italian names top City Hall's roster, but 
they still retain the support of a broad 
coalition. During Mayor Ben DiLieto's 
eight years in office, he has faced only 
an occasional challenge to his post, and 
last year he won his reelection by a 
landslide. This year, 
the DiLieto 
machine has met more than a few 
challenges, and another may arrive 


with next November's mayoral race. 

The job for which Tyson and 
Ferrucci were vying, the Registrar of 
Voters, is a low profile but crucial 
position in the Democratic machine. 
The registrar oversees voting in the city 
by setting the polling places and organizing voter registration. The outgoing 
Democratic Registrar Frank Rossi did 
not have an active registration policy, 
but Tyson, his deputy, wanted one. In 
a city where the minority population is 
growing from 38 percent in 1980 to an 
expected 58 percent in 1992, active 
registration would mean that most new 
voters would be minorities. Tyson tried 
to make voter registration a practice. 
She says that this policy scared the 
machine. "My feeling is that the 
Democratic party in the city of New 
Haven is afraid more blacks and 
Hispanics will register to vote and 
through that process obtain some 
power," Tyson said. 

It was this fear, Tyson believes, that 
made the machine play it safe and 
encourage Ferrucci to oppose her for 
registrar. But according to Ferrucci, "It 
was a personal thing I had to do for 
myself. I made the decision to run." 

Both candidates began their campaigns 
by trying to gain the party nomination 
from the Town Committee-the 60 
ward chairs who elect the party's 
officers. Nomination is tantamount to 
election in New Haven because Democrats don't run against Republicans, 
who have their own Registrar of 
Voters. The evening in late July when 
the Town Committee had to choose, 
they dined at the Melrose Club. In the 
basement room, hazy with cigarette 
smoke, the roll call began ward by 
ward. As Town Chairman Arthur 
Barbieri announced their final vote of 
38-16 for Ferrucci, the dinner broke up. 
A small group of Tyson supporters rose 
from their seats and marched out of the 
room, carrying placards implying that 
the vote was racist. Several supporters 
of Ferrucci called this disruption "rude." 

Ferrucci's supporters on the Town 
Committee deny that their politics are 
racist. They said they chose Ferrucci 
because she was a friend and was 
competent. Richard Abate, a 14th 
Ward Co-chair, said the committee 
should nominate the most qualified 
person rather than hand the job over to 
the next in line. "The position shouldn't 
be a question of tradition, but whether 
we believe the person is going to get the 
job done. I've known Sharon for 15 
years. I knew I could count on her to 
get the job done." Although he couldn't 
recall any instance when Tyson failed to 
do her job, her casual attitude bothered 
him. "She seemed to expect the nomination would fall into her lap because 
she was the deputy registrar." 

From where 19th Ward Co-chair Al 
Mayhew sat, the committee's vote 
looked like a power struggle. "The 
switch was unfair, given her ability and 
time 
in 
the 
position (of deputy 
registrar). She deserved to be registrar," 
Mayhew said. Since Tyson had served 
in her position for 11 years, it wasn't a 
question of her competence, he said. "It 
was a question of control," said Frank 
Logue, former mayor of New Haven, 
who believes that Tyson was less 
malleable than her colleague. 

"Ferrucci was a friend of the party. 
When you have primary elections within the party, the registrar of voters is an 
important figure." He claims that the 
Democratic Town Committee was 
solicited by the town chairman to 
support Ferrucci. But Joe Carbone, the 
mayor's executive aide, said that the 
ward chairs made their decisions 
independently.
