FARM TEAM 
Summer offers a fruitful exchange for 
some ofYale's more agri-minded students. 
Some trade squash rackets for rows ofbut-
ternut; others swap the Sterling stacks for 
sterling steel rakes; a . few leave Elm Street 
for avenues of apple orchards. This year, 
equipped with shovels, spades, and a desire 
for something different, these Yalies left 
behind the gothic buildings and coffee-
fueled all-nighters to step into the world 
ofWWOOF. 

Sporting a catchy and contagious ac-
ronym, World Wide Opportunities on 
Organic Farms is a global organization 
spanning 43 different countries. From the 
rice terraces of Luzon, to the sheep farms 
of New Zealand, to the lavender fields of 
Provence, this network facilitates commu-
nications between volunteers and organic 
farms. The premise is simple; both host 
and volunteer pay a small fee in order to 
publicize and access information about 
organic worksites. Once a WWOOFer 
has selected their farm of choice, they of-
fer free labor in exchange for a roof over 
their head and fresh, organic food on their 
plate. The key, of course, is browsing the 
scores of options and finding which olive 
farm or vineyard is right for you. Think of 
it as agricultural match.com. 

Each summer, more and more students 
across the world are rejecting the tradi-
tional summer internship or study abroad 
course in order to participate in this agrar-
ian exchange program. So why the sud-
den flock to the outdoors? Why the new-
found penchant for physical labor? There 
are, of course, many enticing aspects of 
WWOOF: the allure of travel (and cheap 
September 2009 
travel at that), of escape into the sylvan 
landscape, of having a good story in your 
back pocket. Yet, in addition to globetrot-
ting the world via farms, WWOOF also 
offers a personal journey for its partici-
pants. 

While the organization is a leading 
advocate for environmentally conscious 
lifestyles, it also takes great interest in the 
individual growth of its volunteers. Sue 
Coppard, the founder of WWOOF, be-
gan cis a secretary from London who, after 
years of frenzied metropolitan streets was 
eager to feel the earth between her toes. · 
She recognized that urbanites needed ac- · 
cess to country life just as much as farms 
needed the helping hands of city dwell-
ers. Working on a farm not only reunites 
WWOOF volunteers with nature, but also 
offers them the chance to learn by physi-
cally interacting with the world, as op-
posed to simply studying it in a classroom. 

Eliza Bagg, SM '12, spent her sum-
mer WWOOFing on a plot in Maine not 
because she wanted to be a farmer, but in 
order, she says to experience "a lifestyle 
in which you connect yourself intimately 
with the processes of the world around 
you." A farmer works seven days a week, 
and while the work itself varies little from 
day to day, it puts him in constant contact 
with the elements that make it possible for 
living things to grow and thrive. 

As Bagg suggests, this arrangement pro-
vides a stern contrast to our student life, 
where we work to distance ourselves from 
the world via iPods, text messages, and ac-
tivities that busy our fingers and brains but 
neglect the rest. "Working on a WWOOF 
farm, you can literally take a seed, watch 
it grow, harvest its fruit, and transform it 
· into a product," says Bagg. "The world has 
a richer story that it is trying to tell us if 
we can just let ourselves go out, breathe 
it in, and accept it." WWOOF volunteers 
prepared to yield to Mother Nature are 
rewarded with a new, deeper relationship 
with nature not bound by the pages of an 
Ecology 115 textbook. 

So next summer, if there isn't a special 
job calling your name, head out of the 
library, hand in your laptop for a set of 
Carhartt gloves; and roll up your sleeves. 
It may be time to start digging.
