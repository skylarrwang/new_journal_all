EASY RIDER 
People always say "It'll all go by so fast, 
you know," and I never quite believe them. 
You tell yourself the summer's so long, but 
it's always gone in thirty seconds. So I 
guess common wisdom is right. Time Flies 
When You're Having Fun. After some first-
hand research last night, I propose a cor-
rolary: Time Slogs When You're Flying. I 
went to the carnival this summer, in Paris, 
France. Before I got on "The Boomerang," 
I was told "It'll go by so fast!" Friends, you 
were lying. I was on that ride forever. Hell, 
I might still be on it. 

The carnival, set in the Tuileries, was 
large and varied in its offerings. There was 
a classic Ferris Wheel, the token rickety 
coaster, and a cheery shoot-the-duckie 
booth. There was even a funhouse that 
poofed air up the skirts of every woman 
who walked out its door, Marilyn Mon-
roe-style, answering our naive pre-entry 
questions about that big crowd of men 
lined up outside. There were the requisite 
kiddie rides, accepting individuals too tiny 
to hop on anything else, and there were 
the not-so-kiddie rides, accepting only 
individuals brave souls with a death wish. 
Those gut wrenching, eyeball flipping, 
larynx eroding contraptions that spared 
not one swoop, twirl, or sudden drop. 

The Boomerang was among these elite. I 
~ 
stepped on, an ignorant victim, drawn in 
by peer pressure and bright colors. (Always 
the peer pressure and bright colors; .. ). 

I am usually proud of my vocabulary. 
I love thinking about words and using a 
lot of them. On the Boomerang, howev-
er, my inner dictionary was melted away 
faster than a gelato puddle in the sun. At 
the initial rounds and turns, my phrasing 
was set back fifty years, and I could only 
utter "gee-WHIZ gee WHIZ gee WHIZ" 
and "Lordy! Lordy! LORDY LOU!" 
(where this second phrase came from, 

only the Boomerang Gods know). fu the 
ride went faster, I said nothing, emitting 
only howls, screams, laughs, and wails. I 
could say nothing but "HOLYMOTHER-
FUCKINGSHIT." Over. And over. It felt 
somewhat less problematic to be shouting 
profanity at the top of my lungs because 
people couldn't understand the Â· English, 
although I think it was clear I was some- . 
what distressed. 

I decided to console myself with a new 
ride, the Caterpillar of Joy. I am not sure 
that this is what it was called, but I am 
sure that this is what it would've wanted 
to be called, had it been given a choice. 
The Caterpillar of Joy involves a big, lar-
val, worm-like contraption that you sit in-
side as it creeps over a roller coaster track. 
Some may have called this a "kiddie ride," 
and indeed, I believe it may have been, 
as the average age of passenger seemed to 
be about eight. Nonetheless, I came, he 
crawled, I conquered.
