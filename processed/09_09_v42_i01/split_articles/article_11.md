building were there to do some type of 
handiwork so they just assumed that's why 
I was there. Instead of taking into consid-
eration how I was dressed, all they could 
see was 'black male'." 
Similar episodes of racial profiling are 
not rare. 

Many black Yale students cite instances 
of how, at night, women will clutch their 
purses when passing them, people will 
cross the street to get away from them, and 
·other students will sometimes slam resi-
dential college gates in their faces if their 
IDs aren't readily accessible. 

It may at first seem surprising that an 
institution that prides itself on attempts 
to counter racism could play host to such 
bias. But, as many scholars have pointed 
out, cross-racial interactions, can often 
cause presumably smart people to act in 
ways that are not logical. 

Furthermore, although racism is often 
seen as a scourge of the ignorant, Dr. John 
Dovidio, a professor in the Yale psychol-
ogy department whose research focus is 
aversive racism, explains that prejudice 
has little to do with intelligence. "The way 
to think about implicit bias is as a habit 
of mind. When you grow up in a society 
with racist traditions, that's basically as 
segregated now as it was thirty years ago, 
with big differences in socioeconomic sta-

tus among different races, bias becomes a "' 
subliminal habit." 

Like most habits, racial profiling is not 
easy to prevent and will be even harder to 
eliminate. As Professor Jaynes' story dem-
onstrates, racial stereotyping is not always 
grounded in overt racism. Instead, racial 
profiling usually stems from implicit biases 
that subconsciously influence our behav- · 
• !Of. 

As he was making his way 
down the hallway, two white 
professors exited the eleva-
tor and looked Jaynes up and 
down. c_j1re you here to fix the 
furnace?'' one inquired. 

Implicit Association Tests such as "Proj-
ect Implicit," a web experiment sponsored 
by Harvard, show that 75-80 percent of 
self-identified whites and Asians show an 
implicit preference for white people rela-
tive to black people. Even more surpris-
ingly, at least half of all black people sur-
veyed demonstrated a preference for white 
people over black people. 

In another study, participants are 
quickly exposed to photos of either a 
•• 
HI 
black or white man holding an ambigu-
ous object and asked to identify the object 
as either a weapon or benign article. The 
researchers found that participants were 
much quicker to identify the unclear ob-
jects as weapons when the pho.tos were of 
black men. Respondents are often com-
pletely unaware of these biases, and usually 
identify themselves as unprejudiced on the 
pre-expenment surveys. 

In an interview with the Boston Globe, 
Mahzarin R. Banaji, the Harvard psychol-
ogy professor who heads "Project Implic-
it," said; "I think our data, obtained from 
millions and millions of people, show a 
real. disparity between who we are, who we 
say we are ... and what actually goes on in 
our heads." 

Although what goes on in our minds 
may be implicit, the social ramifications 
are ·anything but. Wes Phillips, TD '1 0, 
recalls his anger at being asked for his ID 
when entering the Yale shuttle behind a 
long l_ine of other students, all of whom 
were white or Asian and had not been . 
asked for identification. 

In another example, Jarrett Burks, CC 
'1 0, was in the basement of Berkeley Col-
lege, which he had reserved for the Yale 
Black Men's Union to host an outreach 
event for black Wilbur Cross high-school-
ers. The kids were bouncing basketballs

and eating pizza when three Yale police 
officers suddenly appeared on the scene. 
They claimed to be responding to a call 
that a black male had broken into Berke-
ley and "was running around in a Yale 
football jacket." 

"Now, I understand that the police 
were just doing their jobs. But from the 
caller's standpoint, does that make any 
sense?" Burks asks incredulously. 

Dovidio's research on aversive racism 
explores these questions. His findings are 
staggenng. 

"Unconscious biases get played out in 
ways that prevent people from recogniz-
ing that they're biased but still have the 
same impact as old-fashioned racism." 

He brings up an example of a panel de-
ciding whether or not to hire various job 
applicants. 

"If the applicant has impeccably strong 
qualifications or incredibly weak qualifi-
cations 
implicit biases arep't expressed. 
You hire the strong candidate, not the 
weak candidate. But when you give peo-
ple a mixture where an applicant has some 
traits that are good and some that aren't, 
whites get hired more than blacks. When 
the applicant is white, the panel weighs 
the qualification that the white is stron-
ger in more heavily. When the applicant 
is black, they weigh the qualification that 
the black person is weakest in." 

This type of bias is especially danger-
ous, as it is often expressed in ways that 
can be justified. 

''Aversive racists rationalize their deci-
sions in ways that have nothing to do with 
race. When people hire a white applicant 
with a high GPA but low SAT scores over 
a black applicant with a low GPA but high 
SAT scores, they can believe that their de-
cision was based on the black applicant 
not having a high enough GPA." Though 
this type of discrimination may not be 
intentional, the outcome is still the same: 
white people have a better chance ofbeing 
hired than blacks. 

PEOPLE'S RELUCTANCE TO TALK about 
race is another fact that further hinders at-
tempts to reduce racial profiling. 

"Initiating 
cross-racial 
discussion 
would alleviate a lot of tension. But race 
is a tricky topic that makes a lot of people 
very uncomfortable," comments Phillips. 
"Most people try to avoid talking about it 
at all costs." 

September 2009 

Among those tiptoeing around racial 
issues in New Haven is the Yale Police 
Department. According to Gila Reinstein, 
Yale's Associate Director of Public Affairs, 
Yale has rules and regulations in place that 
explicitly prohibit the Yale Police from col-
lecting racial statistics of crimes commit-
ted on campus. Reinstein maintains that 
the policy is meant to "avoid racial pro-
filing." The messages from Chief Perrotti 
that are sent out to alert the Yale commu-
nity of criminal incidents on or near Yale's 
campus lack racial descriptions of the per-
petrators, even when the suspect is still at 
large. 

Reinstein declined to comment on 
how Yale could justify ignoring skin color 
in their crime repons when such a policy 
makes it indisputably harder for the Yale 
community to recognize alleged offend-
ers. She empha.Sized instead the require-
ment for, Yale Police officers to complete a 
course on "Cultural Awareness and Diver-
sity" when they carry out their basic rrain-
ing at the Connecticut Police Academy in 
Meriden. Stan Konesky Jr., who was a lieu-
tenant for 29 years in Branford, and now 
teaches this class, explains its mission as 
"heightening the officers' consciousness of 
the differences between different peoples' 
cultures, religions and backgrounds." 

When asked what concrete methods 
are used to help officers avoid racial pro@-
ing, Konesky waxed poetic about an activ-
ity in~olving a box of Crayola crayons. 
"The officers are told to pick whatever 
crayon they want and express themselves 
on a large sheet of paper at the front of the 
room. So then you'll have 40 or 50 offi-
cers who have. all chosen different crayons 
of different colors and types - some may 
be broken, some may be sharp- and ex-
pressed themselves. Thus, the drawing be-
comes like a metaphor for the community 
- with lots of individual drawings of dif- · 
ferent colors and types all coming together 
as a whole."

While this venture may be well-inten-
tioned, it is not likely to put an end to 
racial pro@ing. Especially not when statis-
tics seem to affirm the notion that black 
people are more likely to commit crimes 
than people of other races. According to 
the U.S. Department of Justice, offend-
ing homicide rates for blacks were more 
than seven times higher than the rates for 
whites. Another statistic claims that, based 
on current rates of first incarceration, an 
estimated 32o/o of black males will enter 
11 
State or Federal prison during their life-
time, compared to 17o/o of Hispanic males 
and 5.9o/o of white males. 

But Dovidio insists this data should 
not be taken at face value. "Statistics get 
really complicated because if you look at 
the people who are incarcerated, blacks are 
in jail in a much higher proportion than 
whites are. In a way, it's a logical base rate 
to think: 'I'm looking for a criminal -I'll 
look for a black person. But when you 
profile any group it can actually inflate the 
statistics. It's self-perpetuating. You're cre-
ating the reality." 

Yale Professor of Sociology Elijah An-
derson agrees: "One of the main reasons 
we have such a high black incarceration 
rate is the persistence of concentrated, 
racialized urban poverty. In this context, 
black men are often profiled and scruti-
nized; if white men were in the same posi-
tion, we might have more white tnen in 
prison." Anderson, therefore, thinks our 
oflly hope for eradicating racial profiling is 
for white people to put themselves in that 
pos1t1on. 

"The problem may not be dealt with 
until enough privileged people · "get it," 
so to speak. . And they can only "get it" 
through education about the root cause of 
this problem: the persistence of concen-
trated, racialized urban poverty. 

Racial 
profiling on a broad scale is one of the 
ways in which the wider society, seeking to 
protect itself, reacts to a "dangerous" black 
urban underclass. 

Anderson also believes that, due to 
their position as targets of racial profiling, 
black people often bring an extra measure 
of understanding to their cross-racial so-
cial interactions. In his book Streetwise, 
12 
which explores urban life, the professor . 
labels this extra layer of comprehension 
"street wisdom." He claims that through . 
repeated exposure to street life, as well as 
the stereotypes and fears that accompany 
it, individuals both black and white gain 
comfort "sharing the street with young 
black males." 

Similarly, Dovidio insists that our best 
chance at eliminating aversive racism is 
to increase interracial interactions. He · 
believes this tactic would prove especially 
effective if people were exposed to more 
racial diversity from a young age. 

"In the US we classify people based on 
three dimensions: · race, sex and age. Peo-
ple have argued that both age and sex have 
good evolutionary basis but the argument 
about race is socially constructed. If you · 
cah give people a lot of interracial exposure 
early on in life then race doesn't become 
an important marker in how they see the 
world." 

Dovidio also stresses the importance 
of holding people accountable for their 
biases. 

"Instead of walking around and saying 
'I'm not biased, I'm not biased' we should 
be willing to stop and ask 'Am I biased?' 
When people become aware that they're 
behaving in an unfair way, they're the first 
to want to adjust it." 

Dovidio believes the Yale police should 
undertake this same exercise. 

"How to eliminate racism? You make 
people pause, think and become 
accountable. Police officers might not 
even be aware that they're biased, but as 
long as they don't record the race of a per-
son -
they're never even acknowledging 
that they might be." 

Dovidio adds that to the minority com-
munity on Yale's campus, the police seem 
to be ignoring an issue that is very salient 
to them. 

"It's very hard to establish trust that 
way. The safest neighborhoods are those 
with the faith, trust and cooperation of 
the community." 

But it is not just the police who are to 
blame. In the Burks incident, officers were 
responding to a concerned caller; similarly, 
the police had nothing to do with the ini-
tial misidentification of Jaynes. It is not 
just law enforcement that needs to build 
trust with their communities. It's that we 
need to do a better job of policing our-
selves.
