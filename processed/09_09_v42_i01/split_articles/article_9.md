WAR OF THE WARD 
Ward 22 aldermanic 
candidates face off. 
By LauraZax 
PoP QUIZ: A student living in Silliman, 
Timothy Dwight, Morse, Stiles, or Swing 
Space is a resident of which New Haven 
ward? If you're a freshman who's stumped 
by the question, there's no need to be 
ashamed. Most seniors couldn't answer it 
either. This fact is an obstacle the alder-
manic candidates for Ward 22-the ward 
that includes not only those five Yale resi-
dences, which comprise about one forth 
of the ward's voters, but also the Dixwell 
neighborhood located just north of cam-
pus--face as they prepare for the primaries 
that will take place on September 15th. 
The first name on the ballot for Ward 
22 will be incumbent Greg Morehead, 
who took the seat in the spring of 2007 as 
a result of a special election and proceeded 
to win the seat again the following fall. 
Though Dixwell resident and three-time 
alderman candidate Cordelia Thorpe will 
also appear on the ballot, Morehead's most 
credible challenger is Lisa Hopkins, a com-
munity organizer who unsuccessfully ran 
against him in both 2007 elections. With 
only two weeks to reach out to the ward's 
student constituents, the candidates are 
racing to introduce themselves to the many 
Yale voters who do not even recognize their 
names, including freshmen in Timothy 
Dwight and SiUiman who have just arrived 
on campus. 

And it probably won,t hurt 
Morehead$ image on campus 
that he is a drummer who has 
backed big name acts such as 
Mary J Blige and Bobby Vtzl-
entino at venues illustrious as 
Madison Square Garden and 
the Apollo Theater. 
September 2009 
It's not surpnsmg that Morehead, a 
public school teacher and father of four, 
has focused on youth issues during his 
two years in office. His current platform 
includes continuing to support the youth 
open mic nights he helped begin, and revi-
talizing the Q House, a now defunct youth 
center that is an important symbol to the 
Dixwell community. Even if some Yalies 
fail to recognize how such measures di-
rectly affect them in terms of safer street or 
a more livable community, they will have 
trouble denying the benefits they would 
reap from Morehead's plan to pursue the 
creation of a Bolt Bus route from New 
Haven to New York and Boston. At 31, 
Morehead is among the youngest of New 
Haven's alderpeople, a quality that might 
appeal ro the student demographic. And 
it probably won't hurt Morehead's image 
on campus char he is a drummer who has 
backed big name acts such as Mary J. Blige 
and Bobby Valentino at venues illustrious 
as Madison Square Garden and the Apollo 
Theater. 'Tm nor going to support a candi-
date because he's cool," says Ben Shaffer, YC 
'09, though he admits Obama is an excep-
tion. But Shaffer, who is the deputy man-
ager for Mayor John DeStefano's reelection 
campaign, and who has volunteered for 
Morehead since 2007, concedes that the 
candidate is, well, super cool. And though 
opponents have critiqued Morehead for 
seeking popularity-by-association-brows-
ing through photos of him with celebrities 
on the Ward 22 website does, at times, 
feel like surfing the facebook page of a scar 
gawker-Shaffer points out that Morehead 
has used his connections for the benefit 
of the ward. Last spring. for instance, he 
brought Ludacris--in whose backup band 
Morehead once drummed-co New Ha-
ven ro speak to at-risk youth. 

Bur more important than whom More-
head backs is who backs him. The city's 
Democratic machine is Morehead's po-
litical base: he is the Democratic Party's 
endorsed candidate and is supported by 
Mayor DeStefano. Morehead attests that 
his connections with City Hall do not 
interfere with his ability to represent his 


constituents' needs. 
"Walk with me in · 
bixWell and you'll see I know the people, 
care about their problems and work with 
them to get things done. Walk any street 
with me and you'll see my lawn signs in 
support of my re-election," he wrote in 
an email interview. Morehead's dose as-
sociation with what Thorpe criticizes as 
the city's "democratic hierarchy" no doubt 
gives him a .leg up 1n the election. Yet it 
is this very association that moves Hop-
kins, who believes the ·drummer-cum-
politician fails to march to his own beat 
to challenge _Morehead. Hopkins repre-
sents what Andrew Feldman, Treasurer 
of the Yale Democrats, calls the "tnayor-
skeptical" demographic of Ward 22. Ac-
cordingly, she plans to expand the city's 
Youth at Work program, create neighbor-
hood block watches, Work for an increase 
in homeowner advocacy and eviction pro-
tection, and improve access to services for 
senior citizens. But what makes Hopkins 
stand out is her overarching platform, her 
claim that she would provide checks and 
balances to City Hall by serving on the 
board of aldermen. "A breath of fresh air 
finally! Join the movement oflndependent 
Voices," reads one user's posting on an ar-
ticle about the election in the New Haven 
Independent. 

Hopkins' freedom from machine poli-
tics has taken its toll in the past. During 
the 2007 campaigns, while Morehead was 
able to use connections to get through 
Yale's gates to speak with potential student 
constituents, Hopkins was not so lucky. 
Without widespread campus support, the 
colleges were impenetrable to the candi-
date, who ultimately lost the race. 
But 
Hopkins learned from her past experience, 
and this time around she has been mak-
ing a pronounced effort to reach Yalies 
in Ward 22. She proactively organized a 
meeting with undergraduates before. the 
campus cleared for the summer, recruit-
ing student volunteers who will host her 
within the colleges in the weeks before the 
election. She has even joined Facebook, 
creating her own page to connect to the 
generation of internet addicts she hopes to 
soon represent. "Communication is key," 
says Hopkins. She sees her Facebook page 
as the "start of something much bigger," 
just one small aspect of an improvement 
in community dialogue that she hopes to 
lead. 

Critics of Hopkins were surprised by 
her outreach to the Yale community. In 
the 2007 election, the anti-establishment 
candidate sometimes came off as anti-Yale. 
"For any person in my opponents' camp 
to formuate the idea that I am anti-Yale 
is ridiculous. More than anything I think 
there should be a cohesive relationship be-
tween Yale and the residents of Dixwell," 
said Hopkins. "We're finally coming to a 
place where we're trying to build a com-
munity together, and that's not by separat-
ing the ward into two separate denomina-
tions." Nevertheless, opponents are still 
skeptical, deeming attention to Yale stu-
dents nothing more than political strategy. 

From january through july o 
2009, he was absent at 12 o 
the 14 meetings held by the . 
three committees on which he 
sits, including four o the ve 
meetings o 
Comm.ittee, 
Vice Chair. 
the Public Sa -ety 
o which he is 
Morehead is not free of playing politics 
· himself Those seeking to oust Morehead . 
call him a mouthpiece for the mayor, a 
political puppet focused on · advancing 
DeStefano's agenda rather than catering to 
his constituents' needs. "I am able to work 
with City Hall to improve our Ward and 
because of that I am attacked?" Morehead 
responds to the criticism. Meanwhile, op-
ponents cite his disappointing attendance 
record at committee meetings as testament 
to his lack of motivation. From January 
through July of2009, he was absent at 12 
of the 14 meetings held by the three com-
mittees on which he sits, including four 
of the five meetings of the Public Safety 
Committee, of which he is Vice Chair. 
(He attests that he was struggling with· 
health issues, undergoing and recuperat-
ing from surgery on his foot). "From what 
I understand Greg made promises about 
being the students' alderman, but once 
he got elected he has hardly showed up," 
says Pierson junior Rhiannon Bronstein, a 
Hopkins supporter. 

"Showing up" for an Elm City alder-
man does not only mean attending com-
mittee meetings. Giving someone a job 
application or visiting them when they're 
~ sick ·while that's not headline news, that's 
a lot of what aldermen do," agrees Ben 
Shaffer. The fact that few 
if any 
Yalies 
will go to their aldermen for such services 
has led some students to ask themselves 
not whom to vote for in the alderman elec-
tion, but rather whether they should vote 
at all. "There's always this 'should Yalies 
vote in ·New Haven' question," explains 
Shaffer. After all, many Yale students live 
happily within a bubble whose boundar-
ies are Payne Whitney, Timothy Dwight, 
and Old Campus. While Yalies debate 
which dining hall to have dinner in, many 
of their Dixwell neighbors, 25o/o of whom 
are living below the poverty level, are won-
dering how they are going to afford dinner. 
While Yale will graduate roughly 95o/o of 
this year's seniors, last year saw a 45°;0 
dropo1,1t rate from one New Haven high 
·school. 

So, should transient college students 
have a say in local politics? 
Bronstein 
thinks ~o. "This is where we're spending 
four of the most important and formative 
years of our lives, and we're tasked with 
learning the skills about how we want to 
live no matter where we end up," she says. 
"One of the skills we should want to learn 
is how to be plugged into the community 
, 
youre a part o. 
Though Feldman agrees, he under-
stands where students who fail to show 
up to the voting booth on the 15th are 
coming from. 
The alderman race for 
Ward 1 
the "Yale Ward" 
penetrated 
campus. But "Ward 22 is a harder case," 
explains Feldman. "Yale is a minority in 
the Ward, and we're transient ... .In Ward 
22, it's harder to care about local politics," 
alluding both to the limited status ofYalies 
within Ward 22, and Ward 22 Yalies on 
campus. Yet they still make a sizable bloc, 
one that each candidate needs in order to 
Wln. 
'When voters take to the booth on Sep-
tember 15th whether they be lifetime 
residents of Dixwell or departing seniors 
in Silliman 
they'd do their neighbor-
hood a favor to keep in mind who best can 
unite, and not what most separates, the 
residents ofWard 22. ·
