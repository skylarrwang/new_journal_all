by or on behalf of organized crime syndi-
. cates who use the paintings as barter or 
collateral, or for ransom. The industry, the 
third largest black market behind narcot-
ics and arms trafficking, has been valued 
at $6 billion, an estimate Charney deems 
conservative. Most stolen art, however, is 
sold on the open market, often on Ebay. 
Antiquities, which, according to Charney, · 
make up about 75 percent of the stolen 
. art market, and other little known pieces 
can be easily sold by "doctoring the prov-
enance, which is just a fancy way of saying, 
changing the paperwork." 
Art is also often swapped directly for 
drugs, as in the case of the paintings lifted 
from the Joseph Slifka Center and New 
Haven City Hall in March. 
Over the 
course of a less than a month, the thief, a 
53-year-old heroin addict, stole 39 pieces 
of art from New Haven businesses, gal-
leries, and the New Haven Free Public 
Library by hiding them under his clothes. 
According to police reports, much of the 
art was unsecured, just hanging on the 
wall. Such unprotected displays, Charney 
notes, are common in spaces that, unlike 
museums, are not primarily concerned 
with art exhibitions. According to him, 
18 
churches are especially vulnerable due tO"' 
limited security budgets and an unwilling-
ness to display art in less accessible parts 
of the building or erect barriers, like glass 
cases, between viewers ·and the art. It is 
estimated that thefts from churches occur 
three times more often than thefts from 
museums, galleries, and art dealers com-
bined. Charney's organization, the Asso.,. 
ciation for Research into Crimes Against 
Art (ARCA), which provides free security 
consultations, emphasizes low-cost, mini-
mally invasive technology. "Something as 
simple as a motion sensor and a length of 
fishing line" or a video surveillance system 
will work, says Charney citing the security 
camera footage that played a crucial role in 
the recovery of the New Haven paintings. 
(They were found, in prime condition in 
the thief's home, along with five firearms, 
marijuana and heroin packaged for sale, 
and nearly one thousand dollars in cash). 
Charney's work has gained attention 
from media outlets worldwide, while the 
emerging nature of the general field has al-
lowed him to deviate from the traditional 
path of the academic. In large part, these 
prospects for fame and freedom drew him 
to art crime more than the subject itsel£ 
"There is a certain route one takes: you 
do your undergraduate, Master's, Ph.D. 
and publish an article, then publish ·an-
other during your post-doc" he explains, 
"and you are not supposed claim or ac-
cept commendations of authority." Noah, 
who admits he has "unsubstantiated self-
confidence," has no qualms accepting such 
commendations; at 29, he considers him-
·· 
self an expert 
"the world expert," to use 
his words 
in the field. 
While theft and orgery lead 
to the loss o billions o dollars 
each year, for the individual 
artist, the loss o a painting 
can be good thing. 
He enjoys having relative fame in his 
field without the rigor and discipline of 
working towards tenure, choosing to teach 
only as a guest lecturer or adjunct profes- _ 
sor so he can also have time to write and 
to travel. Over the past seven years, he has 
lived in twelve different cities. Noah speaks
