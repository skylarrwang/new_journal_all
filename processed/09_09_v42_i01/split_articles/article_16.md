I. We admitted we were powerless no- · 
der institutional influence. 
Years ago, on a trip to New York, I heard 
the ringing for the first time. I must have 
been seven or eight 
sometime before I 
stopped believing in Santa Claus because I 
was drawn immediately to the man in the 
red velour suit and snowy beard standing 
beside a red kettle, bells in hand like the 
ones Mrs. Confessore let us use for chorus. 
I wanted to run up to this man, but my 
mother steered me away, scolding me in 
Chinese, "Dou shi pian ren de." Lies, all 
lies. 


Now, years later at college, I associate a 
different ring with the Salvation Army; in 
the store on New Haven's Crown Street, a 
chime hangs from the door, producing a 
tinny sound that is gentler, more sensitive 
than the shaken bells of the street. Wel-
come, this bell says, while its undertones 
imply a familiar message: Support our 
store. Please buy someone hope. A lady 
with grey and white streaked hair calls out 
from behind the glass display case of a reg-

"Hi," I reply, hoping to discover how 
her Salvation Army works. My mom isn't 
there to shoo me away, but the woman is 
a different story. "Oh no, you can't talk to 
us," she says. "Wait <til the manager comes 
back." 
Paul, the manager, a thin .man with 
kind eyes whose apron only partially cov-
ers his long legs, tells me Salvo 
as locals 
call it 
frowns on unsolicited inquiries 
into its operations. Salvo, he claims, is a 
spiritual space. It must be respected: when 
friars visit, no one should be taking pic-
tures, as happened years ago. Salvo is a 
private place. In the back of the store, the 
Salvation Army plays a different role: run-
ning an adult rehabilitation center for men 
trying to quit drugs, alcohol, and their old 
lifestyles, using the twelve-step program of 
Alcoholics Anonymous. Behind the brick 
wall separating the store from the center, 
up to 45 men may be working towards 
sobriety: "We admitted we were powerless 
over alcohol - that our lives had become 
unmanageable. We came to believe that a 
power greater than ourselves could restore 
. 
" 
us to sanity ... 
While money from the bells on the 
street helps support Salvo's other pro-
grams 
soup kitchens, 
shelters, 
after-
school programs 
the . chime hanging 
from the door of a modest storefront on 
Crown Street acts as the sole support for 
the New Haven Salvation Army Adult Re-
habilitation Center. Sales from the store 
almost entirely fund the center, and the 
men who seek help inside. 
Still, the distinction between different 
Salvo venues is often lost due to the orga-
nization's commitment to confidentiality. 
When I ask if I can interview him, Paul 
says, "I have no control over these types 
of things." He is just a regular worker un-
der the institution's payroll and influence, 
with no power to accept or deny requests 
for information. Nevertheless, he refers me 
to the "Captain" of the Army, an ordained 
minister and the real head of this Salvo, 
who decides whether reporters, research-
ers, anybody has permission to talk. 
IT. We came to believe that a power 
greater than ourselves could restore us. 
Captain Merchant is remarkably recep-
tive and well-groomed. I had been half-ex-

peering a full-bearded man like the 1865 
founding General of Salvation Army, Wil-
liam Booth, who, in his time, requested 
Captains to grow beards like his. Today's 
Captain is shaven, young, with dark eyes, 
strong hands, and a sturdy build. Though 
he makes decisions for the New Haven 
store, his primary responsibility is running 
the live-in rehabilitation center, whose fa-
cilities are located alongside a giant ware-
house for importing, sorting, and ship-
ping Salvo donations. ''All of this," says 
Merchant, gesturing around the facilities, 
"supports the boys." 
':All o this, " says Merchant, 
gesturing around the facili-
ties, 'supports the boys. " 
Every morning, six trucks pick up do-
nations. Workers then unload the white 
garbage bags of clothes and miscellaneous 
items 
anything from scuffed rollerblades 
and picture frames to slightly chipped 
bookshelves and wire sculptures 
into the 
back storeroom. The clothes are poured 
onto beige tables and separated into grey 
buckets reminiscent of garbage bins, with 
signs denoting their prices: $7.99 for a se-
quined formal dress, $3.99 for a blue-and-
white checked blouse.

The clothes, sorted by price, are marked 
by differently colored tags which, Mer-
chant says, helps keep track of how long 
items have been in the store. Each item 
has only five weeks to sell before being tak-
en back into the warehouse on the same 
"runner's racks" 
think of a wardrobe on 
wheels 
that it came out on, and taken to 
a different outlet. Every day, five thousand 
articles circulate through a single store. 
While Merchant shows me around, 
the workers in the stor.eroom don't look 
up once; if anything, with the presence of 
the captain, they seem even more meticu-
lously focused than usual on the label of a 
jean, the collar of a shirt. Past the work-
ers hanging clothes, past the grey door, is 
the actual store's space again. "Well, that's 
that," the Captain says, as we reach the 
rows of sweatshirts. There we meet Paul. 
Then, putting to work the power that only 
the Captain can wield, he tells him, "Show 
this girl around." 
III. Made a decision to turn our will 
over as we grew to understanding. 
That so many steps had been required 
for just a simple chat with Paul seemed 
strange: what did Salvo have to hide? De-
spite the Salvation Army's long-time pres-
ence in New Haven, the librarian from 
the New Haven Historical Society can 
only producea thin file labeled "Salvation 
Army, New Haven. [Miscellaneous Publi-
cations]." Inside are only two items, both 
customary handouts from Salvo, both 
from the 1930s. "Maybe they have their 
own library?" she suggests, almost apolo-
getically. They do · have a library, the offi-
cial Salvation Army Archives and Research 
center in Alexandria, Virginia, which is 
open to the public. Still, a serious visi-
tor would need to make an appointment . 
Only archives staff are allowed to photo-
copy documents, but they are not always 
on call. Only certain documents may be 
copied. 
Yet Salvo's stringency, like that of most 
churches, is merely steeped in custom. 
Though most people recognize the orga-
nization more for its social than religious 
services, the Salvation Army is at its heart 
a Christian church organized in the man-
ner of the military, with its own traditions 
and restrictions. Salvo has been in New 
Haven since 1888. Paul has worked in the 
store for the past 15 years. Things were a 
little different back when he began, for 
example a larger staff of at least five at a 
time, whereas now he can rarely get two 
to work the register. But some policies 
don't change. In the New Haven branch, 
at least, captains are still only allowed to

marry other officials within the Salvo hi-
erarchy. Other rules include no soliciting 
within the store. For me, this means no 
asking shoppers questions either. 
IY. Made a searching and fearless 
moral inventory of ourselves. 
Hi, excuse me, sir. Sir, can I have a mo-
ment of your time? I noticed you came 
out of the Salvation Army. Why do you 
shop there? Oh, sorry-
Some people are unresponsive; I try to 
seek out the ones with open faces and jolly 
walks, the ones who won't be angered by 
questions. Why do they shop there? It's 
cheaper! It's economics, you know. People 
want to save money. Ain't nothin' wrong 
with that. 
While Lenny is gone~ the man 
in beige walks over. His eyes 
meet mine. 
c2isten~ '' he says. 
czisten, I know Lenny. And I 
need some help. " 
Lenny sees me taking notes. He walks 
24 
over. "Do you support the Salvation 
Army?" I ask eagerly. "Oh sure," he said. 
"Oh, they do great things. Whenever I 
got somethin' I can~t use, I give it to 'em. 
Support their rehab center, ya know." He 
wears a black bandanna and tells me he's a 
mover, here for a temporary job transport-
ing things into the Schubert Theater. He is 
waiting outside for the hot buffalo wings 
he ordered to be delivered. "Don't worry. 
I'm not preyin' on no women. Unlike that 
guy," he tells me, pointing to the one in a 
beige jacket standing by the entrance of the 
nearby parking garage, and laughs. Lenny 
has a car of his own, pays car insurance, 
rent, gas. Lives an honest life. Tells me his 
address; spells it out on the street. ''Ain't 
got nothin' to hide," he says, shrugging, 
and then waves to the woman through the 
restaurant's window. His wings are ready. 
While Lenny is gone, the man in beige 
walks over. His eyes meet mine. "Listen," 
he says. "Listen, I know Lenny. And I 
need some help." But before he can finish, 
Lenny comes back, opening his tin box of 
wings. "How're you, man?" Lenny says, 
punching the guy who turns out to be Ted, 
fifty years old and recently released from 
prison. "You been in there again?" says 
Lenny. "Well, that's too bad." "Yea," says 
Ted, who adds that he needs a bus ticket 
to Delaware, 42 dollars, to stay with his 
family there. Says he's been homeless for a 
few weeks now. 
"Don't they give you transportation 
money when you come out of prison?" 
asks Lenny. "Oh no," replies Ted. "You 
have to make a special case for that. I 
didn't want to make a special case." Len-
ny shrugs. "Well, why don't you get a job 
then? Why don't you get yourself a rake?" 
-he mimics a raking motion 
"It's leaf 
season, you know ... you could go 'round to 
different doors sayin' 'you need anybody?"' 
Ted says he's tried. Nothing works. Lenny 
- shrugs and reaches into his pocket. I al-
most expect him to pull out some cash, 
but he takes out his cell phone instead. 
"G

"Th

"You need some help?" Ted asks. "Nah, 
nah," says Lenny. "Nah, we've already got 
enough people." And he leaves. 
V. Admitted to God, to ourselves, and 
to another human being the exact na-
ture of our wrongs.

the darkening streets, then turns to me .
