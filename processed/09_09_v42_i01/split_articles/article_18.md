WHEN YOU WALK through the front 
door of my compact suburban house in 
California, you find that the foyer, family 
room, dining room, and kitchen are not · 
separated in any clear-cut way. There are 
no walls, just open space. It's one common 
room, cluttered with a shoe rack, a table, 
bookshelves, kitchen appliances, a couch, 
my morn's unused exercise machine, and 
five video game consoles. From the time 
I was little, it was clear that this was the 
place where every member of my family 
could be left alone to do his or her own 
thing: even today, my dad oddly obsesses 
over the dirty dishes, my mom and young-
er brother lounge around on the couch 
watching TY, and I shoot around on the 
miniature Nerfbasketball hoop that hangs 
from the front door. 


It isn't my first Nerf hoop; I've had doz-
ens since my parents bought me my first 
one to complement the foam basketball 
I already had. Though to most kids this 
present might pale in comparison to the 
neon Nerf blasters that fire harmless, pufl)r 
bullets, I could not have been happier. 
Over the years, the sound of the back-
board thumping against our front door as 
the ball goes through the net has become 
just as familiar as the wailing of rny dad's 
favorite Delta blues artists blaring from 
our stereo on Sunday mornings while he 
compulsively scrubs the kitchen. 


I used to play on the Nerf hoop while 
I watched television. I remember·watch-
ing the first season of American Idol, ball in 
hand, the rest of the family in their usual 
spots. All of the contestants not named 
Kelly Clarkson were crying and screaming 
about getting cut while we laughed hys-
terically at them. "Get over it!" we yelled. 
Some of t~em looked especially miserable. 
"I knew I would make it," they kept say-
ing. "This doesn't make sense. I know I'm 
the one; I'm different, I'm special." 


Instead, I started my own 
franchise, the San Francisco 
Secret. 
I would be the best 
player on the Secret, a de-
ceptively strong 6:11 ';} speedy 
guard who could score from 
anywhere on the court and 
dunk like Michael jordan. 
The show went to a commercial break, 
and I resumed play on my Nerf hoop. I 
jumped as high as I could and slammed 
the little ball through the plastic rim, lost 
in a dunk-filled dream world of my own. 
I had escaped from the reality of basket-
ball played on ten-foot goals. I hurriedly 
retrieved the ball from underneath the 
dinner table and scurried to the back of 
the room for a difficult long shot. It was a 
rare miss. The ball careered off the rim and 
fell right into my dad's bowl of noodles on 
the table. Some of the soup flew out at his 
face, but he didn't seem too upset. Still 
chuckling at the pop star wannabes we had 
just seen on TY, he nonchalantly wiped his 
face, extracted the ball from the broth, and 
handed it back to me. I got right back into 
the game . 


I was fortunate that my parents encour-
aged my incessant, delusional trips into 
the world of Nerf, where all hoop dreams 
came true. Everything would unfold as I 
imagined it would, without me ever hav-
ing to go outside and work on my real-life 
game. First, I would go to Los Altos High, 
where I'd be the star of the varsity squad. 
Then, I would play for Stanford and lead 
the team to a few championships. Then it 
was on to the NBA, where glorim 1s indi-
vidual playoff performances were sure to 
come. Usually, I would perform beauti-
fully in these games. But sometimes, for 
the fans, I would struggle, only to come 


The team I would play for didn't ex-
ist yet. I liked living in the Bay Area, 
so I figured I'd play there once I got to 
the NBA. Still, I didn't want to play for 
the perpetually abysmal Warriors, based 
in nearby Oakland. Instead, I started my 
own franchise, the San Francisco Secret. 
I would be the best player on the Secret, 
a deceptively strong 6' 1" speedy guard 
who could score from anywhere on the 
court and dunk like Michael Jordan. 
Like my real basketball-playing self (who 
today stands only 5'10"), my NBA self 
would be a good ball handler who could 
drive to the lane. But like my Nerf sel£ 
he could also shoot accurately from 40 
feet away. 


I made up and memorized 
how many points, rebounds, and assists 
I would average, and when I watched 
NBA games I would compare real play-
ers' stats with my foam ones. 


Not only was I going to be a local 
icon, I would also be an entrepreneur, 
the new-age Jordan. I would have my 
own line of shoes that I designed mysel£ 
I drew up dozens of full-color blueprints 
for sneakers and assigned each of them 
specific prices. 


None of them would 
cost less than $150 - after all, they were 
Nikes. On each shoe, the N would be 
sewn on in white, and the IKE would be 
in black (like the Secret's uniform). My 
parents were proud of how creative and 
athletic their son could be. 


Luke "Sky" Walker was the Secret's 
center, a 6' 11" beast of a man. He could 
shoot threes like those white guys on 
Indiana's college team and shove people 
around like Shaquille O'Neal. The rest 
of the starting lineup consisted of my 
cousin Julian and two of my best friends, 
Chris and Adam. Together, we won ten 
straight championships, setting every 
imaginable record (75 wins in a season) 
and winning every possible award 
one 
year the five of us were all be selected for 
the five-person All-NBA first team-
along the way. 


As I grew up, I began the trying to 
achieve my dreams outside of my living 
room. In the driveway, I honed the drib-
bling moves I had learned shooting Nerf 
to dart past my dad. At school, I chal-
lenged my friends to HORSE at recess 
and routinely emerged victorious. I spent 
summers at Stanford's basketball camp 
trying to impress my future coaches. I 
joined a youth league and ma-de the all-
star team at the end of the year, but by the 
time I finally got to Los Altos High, I only 
made the JV team. Nonetheless, byy high 
school's end, I had done pretty well for 
mysel£ which had served only to perpetu-
ate my basketball delusion. But the dream 
ended there. College coaches never came · 
calling, and I was forced to confront real-
ity, my American Idol moment. I wasn't 
like that Southern girl who had grown up 
to be Kelly Clarkson, or that skinny kid 
from Wilmington, NC named Michael 
Jordan. I wasn't destined for greatness. 
Contrary to what I had once thought, I 
had never been on an inevitable path to 
success, never on the road from nobody to 
household name. 


Together, we won ten straight 
championships, setting every 
imaginable record (75 wins 
in a season) and winning ev-
ery possible award-
one year 
the 
ve of us were all be se-
lected for the jive-person All-
NBA first team 
along the 
way. 


As it became dear that I was never go-
ing to make it as big as I had previously 
imagined, I would come home from youth 
league or ]V games and pick up my Nerf 
ball. I would escape from the memories of 
forgettable performances and return to my 
basketball utopia, where there still existed 
a hope that one day my lofty expectations 
could be fulfilled. It was a fantasy fueled 
only by- the fact that I happened to be a 
true champion Nerf-baller. 


I had once 
made a house-record 51 consecutive foul 
shots from my imaginary free throw line-
five feet up from the gas heater in the back 
of the room, where there was a dark linear 
spot on the hardwood Boor. I was best at 
shooting straight-on (probably because the 
fronts of Nerf rims start to conveniently 
sag as the hoops get worn down), but I 
was fairly consistent from anywhere in the 
room. Although on real courts I was more 
of a slasher good at driving to the basket 
but mediocre at scoring from long range-
! became a pure shooter in the world of 
Ner£ invincible to all who dared challenge 
me. 


Now at college, I'm trying to make up 
for the real basketball deficiencies I largely 
ignored as a kid. I play a lot - in intra-
murals, for the university club team, and 
even as a practice player for the varsity 
girls' squad. No one comes to watch me 
play anymore, but I don't care too much. 
I remain excited to go practice, and even 
though I'm kind of a nobody now. I'm still 
pleased to have come at least this far as a 
basketball player. 


But I still have my Nerf hoop, just in 
case I need an occasional fix. It hangs on 
my bedroom door, facing out into the 
common room because my room isn't 
spacious enough to shoot around in. 
I 
play whenever I'm feeling restless, and my 
suitemates don't mind, probably because I 
look like an idiot. My forehead is above 
rim-level, and when friends come over to 
find me standing by the hoop, I blush. But 
it doesn't matter. We all know I could still 
beat anyone who tries to take me on.
