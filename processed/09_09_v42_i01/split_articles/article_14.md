Slovene, and some Spanish. Though he 
modestly contends that he "sounds like a 
three year old; every sentence has a gram-
matical error," his mother rebuts that "even 
when he is saying gibberish, he does it in a 
perfect accent." In his native English, his 
voice is deep and enunciated, and changes 
when he says words with the letter L; he 
doesn't "like" going anywhere as a tourist; 
he "1-eye-kes" being in foreign countries 
where he cannot understand everything 
precisely. For him, it creates "a cocoon of 
thoughts," which fuels his creativity. 

Charney's latest exploit took him to 
Ljubljana and the Julian Alps, which he 
had chosen, on a whim, as the setting for 
his second novel, To Catch the Devil. The 
trip also introduced him to Udka Jeran, 
a woman from the small Slovenian town 
ofTunjice whom he married last Septem-
ber. She shares his zeal for adventure; after 
working in mattress and electric fuse fac-
tories and digging potatoes, Jeran left her 
village for China, Peru, and Bolivia. Cur-
rently, she works as a translator, graphic 
designer, and helps manage ARCA, all jobs 
that Noah emphasizes are portable. 

During the spring of 2008, however, 
Noah and Ur.Ska lived with his parents. 
The Charneys temporarily ceded a floor 
of their home to the newlyweds who are, 
according to Diane, "homeless and pretty 
penniless, so to speak." Diane and Jim 
also lent their recently renovated house 
in Umbria, Italy to Noah and Udka. It is 
currently the couple's primary residence 
while they oversee Noah's Master's pro-
gram in Rome. "He is the be-all and end-
all only child," Diane told me, and they 
are the self-described, "proud, hovering 
parents" who have little qualms support-
ing their nearly thirty year-old son. In 
lieu of a small framed photo of her son 
on her desk, Diane has a three-page story 
recounting Noah and Udka's Slovene wed-
ding complete with inlaid photographs of 
the couple plastered to the outside of her 
office door. Jim often stopped by the col-
lege seminar his son taught last semester 
at Yale on the theoretical, historical, and 
practical aspects of art crime.

Forgers, says Charney, are unlike other 
art criminals. Often con-men make-up 
the fringe of the art community: talented 
artists whose work is not selling. "So they 
give the middle finger to the art world 
by tricking them," says Charney. The art 
world, however, abets in. these acts. "Ev-
eryone benefits if a new object enters onto 
the market 
the owner has something of 
value, the middleman receives a profit, the 
collector 
to whom money is not an is-
sue 
gets a trophy, the scholar something 
to study, the journalist," Noah says mo-
tioning towards me, "gets something to 
write about." Though most forgers go to 
jail for a few years, "they are seen as lovable 
crooks," says Charney. 

Once released, 
forgers often become famous in their own 
right by selling copies of famous artists' 
works, but with their signature instead. 

While theft and forgery lead to the loss 
of billions of dollars each year, for the in-
dividual artist, the loss of a painting can be 
good thing. "If it is good enough to steal, 
it must be great," Charney explained. 
"The Mona Lisa was never more famous 
than it was right after its theft." More-
over, crime begets crime. Shortly after its 
return, the Mona Lisa twice became the 
target of vandals, and the work of Edvard 
Munch was stolen three times in ten years. 
Jan Van Eyk's Ghent Altarpiece holds the 
record; the twelve-part panel the size of a 
wall in a small room has been the victim of 
thirteen crimes and seven separate thefts. 
It is the subject of Charney's next book, a 
non-fiction work titled Stealing the Mystic 
Lamb. 

Over the next year, Charney also plans 
to publish a collection of academic essays 
in addition to his second novel, and a se-
ries of art history guides commissioned 
by museums in Spain. Though he will 
be based in Umbria, he plans to travel ex-
tensively in Europe promoting his book 
and continue to "dabble in lots of little 
fields." Ultimately, he feels a multifaceted 
approach to his interests 
novels, televi-
sion, documentary, and scholasticism-
makes the subject accessible to the largest 
number of people and gives him the best 
chance for recognition. The stories of art 
crime are, without embellishment, good, 
he claims. "The truth can be so much 
more unbelievable than fiction," he says 
recalling famous thefts, the black market, 
and the now famous forgers. 

The story 
of his own life 
an American Europhile, 
using art crime to foray into other fields 
without competition, still supported 
by his parents while forging a path to 
fame 
is much the same.
