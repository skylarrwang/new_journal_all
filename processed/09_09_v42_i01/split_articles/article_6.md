SEASONAL DECORATIVE 
DISORDER 
Each year, a few days before December 
25, my family marches like the Magi into 
our garage. We carry three large boxes 
into our living room and spend the rest of 
the evening de-boxing and re.,..dressing our 
seven-foot tinsel tree. Most of the orna-
ments once came in a color-coordinated 
set, but others are special ones from our 
travels. 

Some were impulse buys, some 
were presents, but all are necessary to make 
our tree look and feel complete. When the 
boughs are amply decked, we unwrap the 
plug from around the base of the tree. We 
flip the switch and stand together, gazing 
at the beautiful Christmas tree glowing in 
our Jewish home. 

I have always loved Christmas. Anyone 
who has ever lived with me can attest that 
the holiday madness and Christmas. music 
starts promptly on November 1 annually 
and without fail. Having left Chicago, I 
. can no longer listen to 101.9 FM for all 
my Christmas needs, but I have found 
online radio stations that keep me from 
having a Blue Christmas. Some may think 
that this Midwestern girl gets into the spir-
it too early. They may be right. But since 
moving to New England, I have noticed 
that I'm not alone. In small red barns and 
shopping malls throughout the Northeast 
you may find my like-minded peers in the 
form of Year-Round Christmas Shoppes 
(spelled with a "pe" of course). 

The evolution of Christmas has been 
a long one, but the real start of the com-
modified tradition began after 1880, when 
the machines of the industrial revolution 
began to pump out shiny toys for little 
girls and boys. With unheard of speed, to-
4 
day's capitalist Christmas was born. The 
creation of Santa as a jolly, bearded figure 
began in 1863 with a cartoon by Thomas 
Nast, and Santa soon found himself in the 
company of a great array of other Christ-
mas characters like Rudolph, who trotted 
onto the scene in 1939. These characters 
began to decorate both private trees and 
the public pines of city- sponsored tree 
lightings. 

Beginning in the 1950s, one 
could walk into any department store 
and find Santa on a red velvet seat wait- . 
ing to hear children's hopes and dreams 
for that year's hot products. As the craze 
for holiday paraphernalia grew and stores 
began to carry great arrays of ornaments 
and lights. entrepreneurs realized the eco-
nomic potential of renting out empty lots 
to house independent seasonal Christma.S 
tree and decoration stores. 

In the early 1980s a few shops took the 
concept further when it became apparent 
that they could minimize costs in storage if 
they rented out a space for the year. What 
do you do with a store full of dancing trees 
and synthetic holly in June? It seemed 
only fair to have the stores of Christmas 
• 
cheer open wide for all to peer. The idea 
caught on in small towns across the East. 
Stores began to pop up in quaint wood-
en homes and red barns like the G and 
L Country Barn & Christmas Shop, the 
Bayberry Barn · Christmas Shop, and Per-
rotti's Country Barn & Christmas Shoppe 
·in Connecticut ( the verdict is still out on 
-
whether that is the ubiquitous Yale Chief's 
other profession ... ) . 

The manager of G andL Country Barn, 
Tim Kettle, says that people are drawn to 
the festive atmosphere of his store. "I think 
it is the red ·color of the barn and the warm 
feeling that you get when you walk in," he 
says. ''A back to the country feeling." Nev-
ertheless, Kettle knows that a red barn and 
a New England location do not ensure a 
magic ticket to perennial Christmas suc-
cess. "You really have to remember that 
you will not make any money for the first 
15 years," he said. Only once locals and 
seasonal vacationers come back year after 
year do the small stores gain reputations 
and big bucks. 

During 
the 
off-season, 
Chrisunas 
stores take a different tack, trading images 
of Claus for New England clam chowder, 
substituting sleighs for seashells, and gen-
erally capitalizing on the ornaments and 
traditions that symbolize the Northeast. 
"We do sell lots of ornaments year round 
here, but the ones with a summer look or 
ocean theme tend to sell better," Kettles 
says. "People that are on vacation always 
want to bring home something that will 
remind them of our store or something 
that they have done in the area." He holds 
to the three golden S's of the tchotchke 
trade: "Swimming, seaside, sports." 

Small towns are not the only ones that 
let the most wonderful time of the year last 
all year. The New England-based Christ-
mas Loft boasts six store locations across 
the region. If a New Englander begins to 
crave the cold, they can always head over 
to the Christmas Loft for life-size Christ-
mas villages located in two of the outlets. 
Once there, browsers can find makeshift 
ch~rches, an old country store, even a cov-
ered bridge while a mechanical Santa in-a 
sleigh flies over the fake town. 

These stores make green . selling the 
red and green all year, but they have no-
ticed that they can, like the barns in tiny 
towns, focus sales on the wandering tour-
ist. Ronnie Vander Veer, vice president 
and co-owner of The Christmas Loft and 
co-owner, says that visitors love the spec-
tacle, claiming that "going into a highly 
decorated, magical Christmas store is an 
experience." When people step out of the 
reality and into their Christmas fantasies, 
everything begins to sell. Vander Veer says, 
"We sell thousands of ornaments, both lo-
cal, state-themed ornaments and just orna-
ments for people to give others: personal-
ized pieces, pets, and more." 

Like me, Mrs. Vander Veer swears by 
Christmas. Visitors will find holiday tunes 
turning the hottest days into visions of 
snowy sidewalks. But not all stores are the 
same. Kettle sees the magic of Christmas, 
but often finds it a bit too cheery. "Don't 
get me wrong," he said, "I have six trees 
in our house decorated and over five thou-
sand white lights outside my house. But 
I am a little crazy when it comes to Hal-
loween. We do a two-car garage over as a 
walk-through fun house. Very scary." 

But as long as they don't make it a goal 
to sea re away the customers, New England 
visitors and residents can expect to see
