WE IN THE IVY LEAGUE like to think 
of ourselves as progressive: our schools of-
fer the best financial aid packages, record 
some of the highest minority enrollment, 
and frequently produce research at the 
vanguard of a variety of social issues. 
Lately, Yale has placed particular focus 
on overcoming racial barriers. In 2007, 
President Richard Levin asked the incom-
ing freshman class to read Beverly Daniel 
Tatum's book Why Are All the Black Kids 
Sitting Together in the Cafttetia? And Other 
Conversations About Race. Tatum, who 
also serves as president of the historically 
black Spellman College, gave the open-
ing address after which students discussed 
her comments with their new peers and 
freshman counselors. Later that year, af-
ter incidents of racist graffiti near Pierson 
College and snowball swastikas on Old 
Campus, Yale held town hall forums and 
other events to promote dialogue on race 
in hopes of preventing similar events from 
happening in the future. Last spring, Yale 
played host to the Connecticut chapter 
of the National Association for the Ad-
vancement of Colored People's centennial 
celebration. Long all-male, all-white, all-
rich strongholds, the members of the Ivy 
e have slowly started to address their 
issues with race. 

An event in Cambridge, Massachusetts 
this summer brought these ongoing strug-
gles into the public eye. By now the story 
is familiar. Bleary-eyed Harvard scholar 
Henry Lewis Gates Jr. returns home from 
China to find that his door is jammed. 
Assisted by his driver, he forces the door 
open, prompting a neighbor to call the 
Cambridge police to report a possible 
break-in. The police arrive; six minutes 
later, Gates is led out of his own home in 
handcuffs and brought to jail on charges of 
disorderly conduct. 

The facts are black and white, but their 
interpretation is far less clear. Gates, whose 
only offense was belligerent speech, insists 
his arrest was a blatant example of racial 
profiling. "If I had been a white professor 
answering the door, there is no question 
in my mind that I would not have been 
arrested. I will go to my grave absolutely 
convinced of that." On the other hand, 
Sergeant Crowley, who spent five years 
teaching Lowell police cadets about how 
to avoid racial profiling, insists that profes-
sor Gates' race played no part in his arrest. 

It is unclear whether the Gates incident 
was a display of racial profiling, or simply a 
tale of two egos. Regardless, what the epi-
sode clarified is that Ivy League campuses, 
however tolerant they may purport to be, 
are not immune to racial tensions. 

Several years ago in the dead of winter, 
Yale professor Gerald Jaynes walked into 
the psychology building for a meeting 
with a senior psychology professor. The 
furnace had been broken for several days; 
the building was frigid and Jaynes, who 
has taught in Yale's Economics and African 
American Studies departments since 1977, 
tied his "expensive-looking" overcoat even 
tighter around his suit to stay warm. As he 
was making his way down the hallway, two 
white professors exited the elevator and 
looked Jaynes up and down. 
~ "Are you here to fix the furnace?" one 
inquired. 

Jaynes paused. He stared silently. at the 
men before retorting, "Well, at least you 
gave me a skill." 

Recalling the incident, Jaynes remarks, 
"It was pretty pitiful." But Jaynes is gener-
ous. Recognizeing the complexity of racial 
profiling, he refuses to blame the junior 
professors for their misplaced perceptions. 
"It is unlikely that those junior professors 
were actually racist. But that just goes to 
show you how powerful stereotypes are.
