"Lenny and I go way back, to 1992," he 
tells me. "We were both in the same re-
hab program together, right back behind 
there" 
he points to the store. I wonder 
why Lenny didn't mention his participa-
tion in the program as he expounded on 
the virtues of the store, even after I had 
mentioned my interest in the rehab cen-
ter. "Anyway, it worked for Lenny. It's 
good for some people, you know." Ted 
sighs. "Listen. I don't want you to feel 
sorry for me." But he needs money to get 
to Delaware. "This is all I got on me," he 
says, indicating his jacket, his sweatpants, 
his old backpack. 
~7 was always on the other 
end o things, you know, "she 
says. '1 used to have a person-
al shopper." 


My parents have always admonished 
me for throwing quarters into the hats of 
the homeless in Manhattan; where they 
were raised in China, people are suspi-
cious of swindlers. I want to believe Ted, 
but I have no change. I scavenge and hand 
him my only bill, a crisp one, my parents' 
money. He accepts it soundlessly. 
"I stepped off the path. I was doin' al-
right, but me and mah girl broke up," Ted 
continues. "Now I'm not sayin' that's an 
excuse or anythin', but" 
she filed a suit 
against him. He broke the restraining or-
der and was sent back to jail. 


"So why can't you go back to Salvation 
Army?" I ask. "Can't they help you?" 
''I'm not steppin' through those doors 
again," he replies. "It's a process, a whole 
process. And they don't do anything for 
, 
you. 


VI. 
Were entirely ready to remove 
all these defects of character. 


Even for those who want to change, 
Kelly, a counselor at the Adult Rehabili-
tation Center, says the success rate of the 
New Haven branch is about 10 percent, 
just slightly higher than the average for 
the Salvation Army nationwide. The men 
who show up for the six-month program 
often come from local detoxes, or are re-
ferred there by parole or probation offi-
cers. Some people just walk in. Kelly says 
the center accepts anyone who isn't a reg-
istered sex offender, a convicted arsonist, a 
woman (the center is an all-men's facility), 
or someone physically unable to do work 
therapy. 


Work therapy means forty hours of 
work at Salvo week for each resident, usu-
ally in the sorting room, or store, or as a 
truck driver or box mover. The workers 
aren't paid, but they are given a "gratuity." 
Seven dollars a week for the first week, 
then up to nine, ten, and finally maxing 
out at 18 a week. 


VII. Humbly asked for our short-
comings to be removed. 


Jared is putting stickers on video-
tapes, marking each battered cardboard 
box with a price, $1.99 for movies he has 
heard of, $.99 for kid's movies and more 
obscure films. "Are you a worker here?" I 
ask, cheerf11lly. "Uh, no, unfortunately, 
I'm in the program," he replies stolidly. 
"Well, that's good, at least you're getting 
help," I say. "Well ... " He hesitates. "Yes 
and no. I mean, you still pretty much have 
to do eve 
· g yoursel£" 


It's his second time in the program. 
........ Ibis tirne, he carne voluntarily. Jared's 
case, Kelly tells me, is not unique: "Un-
fortunately, we have a lot of repeat offend-
ers." Some guys just keep coming back to 
Salvo, relying on the organization to take 
care of them the same way others rely on 
""\VT

says Kelly. "There's Salvation Armies in

dence ... some people make a whole circuit

tnp. 
or 
y-go- roun ers, S vation 
Army is the solution to an otherwise un-
stable life, a way to move forward with the 
beginnings of each new program. 


But Jared is clearly disappointed in 
himself and a little disappointed with 
Salvo; his voice is quiet, his eyes look any-
where but at me, and when Paul comes 
over, he stops talking altogether. 


Vlll. Made a list of all things we had 
harmed, and became willing to make 
amends to them all. 


Most people have been friendly and 
responsive to my questions, but some 
take offense. One says sharply, "It's none 
of your business," when I ask her why she 
shops at Salvo. I can't forget I'm a Yale 
student when I'm here, that their finances 
are none of my business, that I'm look-
ing for different things from . this store, 
· and, unlike the woman who struggles with 
her husband to decide whether or not she 
should purchase a two-dollar video game 
that might not work on her console, I 
spend at will, almost frivolously in com-
parison: a one-dollar vase for my suite, an 
eight-dollar outfit for Halloween. Four 
Yale freshmen boys browse for "fat lady in · 
drag" costumes. 


Few people come to Salvo for deeper 
reasons than saving money, but maybe 
they don't need to. They don't want to 
know more about the organization and 
how it ser¥es others when they need Salvo 
to serve themselves; they don't always have 
the luxury or time to ask questions like I 
do. 


Some seem barely able to purchase 
from Salvo at all. Paul tells me people 
steal from the Salvo store all the time. Just 
the other day, he caught a woman with a 
child stuffing clothes into the bottom of 
the stroller. Others pack clothes into draw-
ers in the used furniture room, to retrieve 
them at a later time. Some go as far as to 
switch their worn-out shoes with a pair of 
Salvo's from the shelf on the spot. "People 
just don't respect this place," says Paul. 


IX. Made direct a mends to such peo-
ple whenever possible, except when to 
do so would injure them or others. 


When I first arrived at the store, I no-
ticed a woman walking through the aisles 
with intensity, picking up after the shop-
pers. Hangers and clothes are constantly 
strewn over Cindy's arms as she searches 
for the right places to put them. When I 
ask her her story, she surprises me. She's a 
volunteer here. Oh, and she used to be a 
millionaire, she tells me, in a tone so mat-
ter-of-fact that it holds the ring of truth. "I 
was always on the other end of things, you 
know," she says. "I used to have a personal 
shopper." When I comment on her inten-
sity in work, she laughs. "Well, I worked 
for a restaurant corporation for 30 years," 
she says. "And I just love this store. I want 
to improve it. Paul, all the guys here, 
they're great. They spoil me." 


Years ago, she and her ex split up and 
she decided to go out East. Then, another 
ten years and an abusive relationship later, 
she lost her money, became homeless, be-
gan staying at a shelter. In 2008, Cindy 
dropped by this store with no resources, 
no outdoor clothes for the increasingly 
cold fall. Someone had told her she could 
maybe work for clothes at Salvo. So she 
worked for five hours and earned a coat 
and jeans, especially important for some-
one who used to be from California. 


Paul tells me people steal 
om the Salvo store all the 
time. just the other day, he 
caught a woman with a child 
stu ng clothes into the bot-
tom o the stroller. Others 
pack clothes into drawers in 
the used furniture room, to 
retrieve them at a later time~ 
Some go as -ar as to switch 
their worn-out shoes with a 
pair o Salvo's from the shel 
on the spot. uPeople just don't 
respect this place," says Paul. 


She is still living at that shelter, work-
ing at Salvo for no pay and few benefits, 
coming to help out at the store even on 
days when she doesn't have to. She com-
pliments customers' clothing choices. She · 
· walks around the store with vigor. ''And," 
as she rings the register, she says, ''I'm 
happy." 


X. Continued to take personal in-
ventory and when we were wrong 
prompdy admitted it. 


If Cindy never feels out of place at 
Salvo, why should I? I used to feel guilty 
stepping inside the store, not because 
I thought I was better than the people 
there, but afraid that those same people 
would think that I thought I was bet-
ter. Mraid that my middle-class past and 
present 
not rich, but certainly far from 
poor 
meant not being able to under-
stand the different pasts and presents of 
other shoppers. 


A woman is looking at a decorative 
plate 
a deep, cratered sort of thing, with 
a scene of a castle carved in. I ask her if 
she thinks she's going to eat out of it and 
she laughs. "What is this place?'' she asks, 
tilting her head. "Is this France?" I don't 
know either. We turn the plate over and it 
reads: Neuschwanstein 1357. "Oh God ... 
Noos-k-wan-steen," she sounds out slow-
ly, chuckling. "Who would go there?" 


Jared, who is more willing to talk to 
me lately, explains that he's never been 
out of the country. But his rich sponsor~ 
the recovery programs encourage you to 
have a sponsor 
flew him to Florida for 
a week before his rehab program began, 
the first time, in 200 1. Daytona Beach. 
"I still think he was tryin' to show off a 
bit, you know," says Jared of his sponsor. 
But it was the only time he's ever traveled. 


Now in his second round with the 
program, he's worked at the store for two 
months. "I get paid like, what, 17 cents 
an hour?" But he doesn't seem too bit-
ter:. "I guess it's for discipline." Still, he 
says~ you can't break the rules: no drugs, 
no alcohol, no women. "If you break the 
rules," he says, "they penalize you. Some-
tim~s you get kicked out or they give you _ 
what they call 'P.R T' 
Personal Reflec-
tion Time." Residents on PRT are unable 
to leave the premises of the rehab center, 
and even during the allowable times, cur-
fews are normally ten on weekdays and 
eleven o'clock on weekends. The men are 
not allowed to call friends. 


A man appears from the grey door of 
the storeroom as Jared is still talking. That 
man points his finger towards Jared, ges-
turing for him to come in. "Uh-oh," sings 
Jared as he goes over and looks at me with 
his eyebrows raised . 


XI. Sought through prayer and 
meditation to improve onr conscious 
contact with people there, ptaying only 
for knowledge and the power to carry 
that out. 


At Yale, the conception of Salvation 
Army seems to be dominated by the 
clothes the store sells. Paul shows me Yale 
Daily News articles written about it be-
fore, including one about Yalies looking 
for wild clothing at Salvo for the Safety 
Dance, the school's annual 80s-themed 
dance. Another describes "finding an out-
fit for under $100 in New Haven." 


But there's more than cheap stuff in 
the discarded piles: eve 
· g in Salvo 
is a transfer of histories, from the mother 
who chooses to donate her daughter's 
once-loved doll to the workers in the 
storeroom who, in silence, puc rags on 
sweaters as they work through their thera-
PY• to the customers, the ones who choose 
carefully amongst rhe debris for something 
new ro call rheir own, items rhey can give 
a future. 


XII. Having had an awakening as the 
result of these steps, we tried to carry 
this message to all people, and to prac-
tice these principles in our affairs. 


I walk to rhe COs and rapes section, 
nor really knowing what I'm looking for, 
but pick up a hand-made cover: September 
2001 mix. Jared walks over. "September 
11, '0 1, char's my birthday." He can't pos-
sibly be seven years old. He's calking about 
che day he was incarcerated, in Connecti-
cut, as the Towers fell. "I wish I never had 
rhac birth dare," he says. "I rry ro forger 
about the past ... bur then I see something 
like that. And it brings ir all back." 


Some things remain deeply private in 
Jared's memory. These memories, these 
pasts, nestled within a person, may need 
nothing more than an object, a tide, the 
ring of a bell to Aoar into consciousness. 


Salvo is a spiritual space, a private 
place. The organization seems almost a 
blend of the public and the private: giving 
people the garments with which chey pres-
ent themselves to the world, and, behind 
closed doors, trying to heal their tortured 
inner selves. Asking questions may only 
probe further inro the hurt, the memories. 
Maybe this is why Salvarion Army prefers 
fewer questions. Salvo remains hidden, 
steeped in a habit of silence. 


While Ted nurses his old wounds and 
repeats his mistakes, Lenny and Cindy live 
happily, blurring their pasts, focusing on 
the present: Lenny perhaps pretending he 
was never in rehab, adjusting to a com-
pletely new lifesryle. Each time an item 
makes it our from the warehouse and is 
purchased by someone, char item's history 
replaced by its new purpose. 


Back in my dorm, I place the Sep-
tember mix inro my computer. The com-
purer hums and I am hopeful, bur it srops 
abruptly. No songs show up. What now? 
Salvation Army's items policy: no re-
turn.
