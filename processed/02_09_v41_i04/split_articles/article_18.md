able rate mortgage owing more than their 
house is worth." 

New Haven, as an urban center with a 
high incidence of poverty and low-income 
housing, became a locus for sub-prime 
mortgage agreements. "Connecticut is a 
fairly wealthy state," explains Eva Heint-
zelman of the Greater New Haven Com-
munity Loan Fund, a New Haven based 
non-profit that provides low-interest loans 
to low-income prospective homeowners, 
"but there is a lot of inequality. Bridgeport, New Haven, Waterbury 
we do 
have some weak markets where we have 
relatively high rates of sub-prime arroga-
tion," she says, referring to banks' seizure 
of houses that have defaulted on their sub-
pnme mortgages. 

By the end of 2007, nearly 20 per-
cent of all mortgages in New Haven 
or 
roughly 4,000 loans 
were sub-prime, 
and, unsurprisingly, they were focused in 
the city's lowest-income areas. In fact, over 
60 percent of all foreclosures in New Ha-
ven take place in only six neighborhoods: 
The Hill, Newhallville, Fair Haven, Quin-
nipiac Meadows, Beaver Hills, and the An-
nex. 

SINCE MID-2008, the ROOF Project 
has led city efforts to stem the foreclosure 
tide. While, in theory, the organization 路路 
is sponsored by City Hall and the Office 
of the Mayor, in practice, it is comprised 
mainly 路of representatives of local non-
profits. Heintzelman and Paley both serve 
on the steering . committee, along with 
DeStefano (ex-officio), tWo aldermen, 
and representatives from Yale Law School, 
United Way, and New Haven's religious 
community. The directors are responsible 
for determining how to distribute funding 
allocated for housing recovery 
including 
a recent $3.2 million grant from the fed-
eral government's Department of Housing 
and Urban Development (HUD), award-
ed in early February. Most of the funds 
end up in the hands of the neighborhood-
level non-profits under the ROOF Proj-
ect's umbrella, as well in those of a few 
for-profit developers. "Money spent on 
professional non-profits that are in the 
trenches day in and day out is money well-
spent," Paley says. 

Sameera Fazili, a clinical professor and 
Ludwig Community Development Fel-
low at Yale Law School and a member of 
the ROOF Project's steering committee, 
is pleased with the mayor's efforts. "The 
city has been a partner with us all the 
way," she says, but she still believes that 
community organizations and private de-
velopers are often best-positioned to help 
recover hard-hit neighborhoods. "I think 
that the best way to respond to the situa-
tion is with a combination of non-profits 
and the private sector," she says. "Private 
sector developers are wonderful as long as 
they are monitored to make sure that they 
are doing quality work on the houses they 
are . restoring. As for neighborhood-level 
recovery, the local non-profits know- the 
neighborhoods best, and they're the ones 
who are best positioned to help rehabili-
tate them." 

Much like the organizations that com-
prise it, the ROOF Project uses many dif-
ferent tactics to confront foreclosure. "We 
suggest a three-pronged approach," says 
Fazili 
first, community outreach, "to let 
people know that there is help out there for 
them if they get involved early enough," 
followed by much-needed assistance and 
counseling in dealing with mortgage debt, 
including consulting with HOD-certified 
counselors and state-sponsored mediation 
between bank lenders and at-risk borrow-
ers. And then, to prevent foreclosures from 
spreading, the Project focuses on neigh-
borhood stabilization. 

This final tactic is meant to forestall the 
destructive effect a small number of fore-
closures can have on entire residential ar-
eas. Heintzelman describes this dynamic as 
a "tipping point," when one or two vacant 
houses lead to a rapid decline in a neigh-
borhood's property values and an accom-
panying rise in its rates of foreclosure. 

"Neighbors who are paying their mort-
gages are seeing the value of their property 
decline," Fazili explains. "We are going to 
see a lot more boarded-.up houses. You are 
going to see an increase in crime and a real 
decline in the city's tax base if we don't ad-
dress this on a neighborhood level." 

If this task sounds daunting, it is. In the 
short term, with foreclosure rates rising 
and whole neighborhoods at risk of reach-
ing the "tipping point," the ROOF Project 
will be confronted with record numbers 
of homeowners in need of guidance. One 
step of the process that is particularly cru-
cial for residents to understand went into 
effect in July of 2008. Connecticut Pub-
lic Act No. 08-176, "An Act Concerning 
Responsible Lending and Economic Se-
curity," grants homeowners who have re-
ceived a foreclosure notification the right 
to request a meeting with their lenders 
to try to negotiate a settlement. It also 
instructs lenders not to begin foreclosure 
proceedings until they have made a "good 
faith effort" to determine the borrower's 
ability to pay. If a homeowner requests a 
meeting, loan originators are now legally 
required to sit down with him or her and 
a state-appointed judicial mediator who 
will attempt to strike a compromise and 
restructure the loan so that the borrower 
can pay it off over time, while remaining 
in his or her home. 

The law was heralded as a major boon 
to at-risk homeowners, but in practice, 
it has proved useless unless homeowners 
are atypically well-informed. Many are 
unaware of their right to mediation, and 
they lose that right if they fail to request 
a meeting within 15 days of receiving a 
foreclosure notice. Moreover, while the 
bill requires that banks and lenders meet 
with homeowners and agree on new terms 
if a borrower can prove his or her ability to 
pay, states are not allowed to enforce such 
terms. Bankruptcy judges, for example, do 
not have the power to unilaterally rewrite 
the conditions of loans if they feel a lender 
is being unreasonable. 

So while most advocates feel that the 
on-the-ground rehabilitation work is best 
done by community-based organizations, 
they also want to s~e the state and federal 路 
government work more actively to enforce 
banks' cooperation. "The best role the state 
and federal government can play, in my 
opinion," says Fazili, "is to put pressure on 
banks and financial institutions to modify 
loans to keep homeowners in their homes, 
then helping non-profits to buy foreclosed 
properties, rehabilitate them, and sell 
them at a reasonable price." 

Nobody is more emphatic on this point 
than Robert Solomon. A member of the 
ROOF Project, supervisor of the Yale Law 
School's Clinical Studies Program, and for-
mer director of the New Haven Housing 
Authority, Solomon is a man who minces 
no words. "I teach a clinic on housing and 
community development and I . teach a 
clinic on domestic violence," he says, "and 
I have found that it is easier to deal with" 
a domestic abuser than it is to deal with a 
bank or an attorney for a bank." 

For the veteran Solomon, as for Paley, 
the villains in the housing collapse are in-
disputably banks. After years of predatory 
lending, mortgage discrimination, and 
irresponsible securitization of mortgage 
loans, he says, banks bear much of the 
blame for creating the current economic 
crisis but have yet t() be held responsible 
for their actions. "Banks have been wrong-
doers throughout this entire process," he 
says. "They have been wrongdoers and 
they are trying to reap the benefit of their 
wrongdoing." 

As the director of a housing clinic at 
the Law School, Solomon has had a first-
hand look at many of the mediations re-
sulting from Public Act 08-176. "It's not 
adequate 
totally inadequate," he insists. 
"Banks do not do real mediation." In-
stead, he says, many loan originators send 
unprepared attorneys to meetings and do 
not authorize them to make alterations to 
loans. 

Some, like Heintzelman, claim that, 
though more governmental regulation 
would be helpful, mediations can garner 
results. She explains that the Greater New 
Haven Community Loan Fund has been 
"quite successful" in modifying a number 
of its clients' loans. 

But Solomon believes that without ex-
plicit powers of enforcement, the right to 
mediation is meaningless. "The judges in 
foreclosure courts need specific litigation 
allowing them to rewrite mortgages and 
to force banks to comply with mediation," 
he argues. "Otherwise the legislation does 
nothing." 

State Senator Bob Duff, Democrat of 
Norwalk and Darien and co-chair of the 
Senate Banking Committee, which wrote 
Public Act 08-176, acknowledges that 
there may be room for improvement in the 
legislation but insists that critics like Solo-
mon undersell it. "Can it be better?" Duff 
says. "Possibly. But we're only six months 
old and we have already helped thousands 
of people stay in their homes through the 
mediation process. Connecticut is cur-
rently the only state in the nation that has 
a banking mediation program, and I think 
it's been very successfuL" As for Solomon's 
enforcement concerns, Duff is skeptical 
that giving foreclosure judges the power to 
rewrite loan terms if they feel loan origina-
tors are acting unreasonably is possible, or, 
for that matter, desirable. "Frankly, I am 
not so sure judges want that power," he 
says. "Granting judges that kind of power 
is something we would need to study very 
closely. For right now, though, I think 
we're doing very well." 

And the legislation, which has appoint-
ed twelve judicial mediators across the 
state 
two of whom are based in New Ha-
ven 
has seen some success. As of Decem-
ber 31, mediators had successfully kept 
57 percent of all mediation applicants, or 
681 homeowners, in their homes, usually 
through mediated loan modifications. But 
the numbers only tell half the story: While 
mediation does have a relatively high suc-
cess rate, not everyone obtains it. In New 
Haven, according to statistics provided by 
the Senate Judiciary Committee, 358 peo-
ple applied for mediation between July 1, 
2008, when the bill entered into law, and 
December 3 L but another 969 who were 
eligible did not apply. "One of the biggest 
problems we face," Heintzelman says, "is 
that people get something from the court 
and they freak out and do nothing, and 
then soon it's too late." 

WHILE MUCH OF THE ROOF Project's 
task in the coming years will be to close this 
gap, s(;me of its constituent organizations 
have more wide-ranging and long-term 
plans. Many members place paramount 
importance on education and outreach, 
especially in low-income neighborhoods. 

"Homeowners need continuing guidance 
on how to manage their mortgages and fi-
nances," says Fazili. In the long term, this 
would entail not only homeowner educa-
tion programs, but also government-spon-
sored shared-equity programs, in which a 
state or local government would provide 
financial assistance to first-time, low-in-
come home buyers in exchange for a share 
iri the value of their property. Such路 guid-
ance might also include Individual Devel-
opment Accounts (IDA), organizations in 
which donations from a number of sources 
are used to match the savings of low-in-
come home buyers in order to encourage 
homeownership without relying on risky 
loans, and other public and private incen-
tive programs to provide homebuyers with 
alternatives to high-interest mortgages. 

Such programs, according to Fazili, have 
the double benefit of stabilizing housing 
markets and educating first-time home 
buyers. 

c1 think that the major rami-
fication of this crisis will be 
路 that we rethink the way we 
push home ownership on low-
income 
says 
Fazili. 

Paley agrees that, in order to recover 
from the housing crisis, advocates must 
encourage long-term financial responsi-
bility as well as guide people through the 
foreclosure process. "Our whole work for 
the past thirty years," he says of Neighbor-
hood Housing Services, which has ,been 
providing counseling and homeownership 
education since its founding in 1979, "has 路 
been to encourage responsible borrowing." 

NHS currently offers a number of classes 
in homeownership and financial manage-
ment, including courses on credit counsel-
ing, foreclosure intervention, and budget 
and financial management. "The whole 
object of our Home Ownership Center is 
to encourage homeownership eventually," 
Paley explains. "But everyone that goes 
through our program goes through an ex-
treme horileownership education." 

Another primary long-term goal of the 
ROOF Project, and one that NHS and the 
Greater New Haven Community Loan 
Fund have been working on for years, is 
to preserve neighborhoods' market val-
ues and improve their community fabrics 
in the face of expanding blight. Since its 
founding thirty years ago, NHS has de-
vel oped 38 5 units of affordable housing, 
helped 475 first-time homebuyers pur-
chase homes, and enrolled 811 applicants 
in IDA programs. Since 1988, the Greater 
New Haven Community Loan Fund has . 
originatced over $44 million in low-interest 
loans for affordable housing. Much of the 
funding for such organizations, howeyer, 
comes from state and federal grants, banks, 
and charitable contributions, all of which 
have been pummeled by the recession. 

And while NHS, for example, is able to 
restore about twenty units of housing per 
year, and the Greater New Haven Com-
munity Loan Fund is able to originate 
about $2 million worth of loans a year, 
the City recently estimated that New Ha-
ven contains 800 abandoned houses and 
a rising number of evicted homeowners. 

Ultimately, the crisis may force the city to 
reconsider its homeownership-prioritizing 
mentality. "I think that the major ramifi-
cation of this crisis will be that we rethink 
the way we push home ownership on low-
income communities," says Fazili. 

Asked about his hopes for New Ha-
ven's recovery, Jim Paley remains guarded 
but not entirely pessimistic. "It really de-
pends on whether the economy can get 
back on its feet," he says. "If unemploy-
ment remains where it is, people won't 
have money and won't be able to remain 
in their houses. It's so critical we have an 
economic stimulus that works in order to 
get people working again, and in order to 
get the consumer confidence index up so 
people start buying again." 

Ultimately, for Paley and the other rep-
resentatives of New Haven's governmen-
tal and community-based--organizations 
scrambling to deal with the housing mar-
ket's collapse, working "in the trenches" 
can only accomplish so much. Without 
.effective governmental regulation and en-
forcement, the foreclosure epidemic could 
continue indefinitely. "Can we emerge 
from this without a total crisis?" Paley 
muses about New Haven's future. "Yes, 
but it's going to take some real leadership."
