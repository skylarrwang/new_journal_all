While the dramatic failures of financial 
powerhouses like Lehman Brothers and 
AIG in September, 2008 are often consid-
ered the beginning of the current global 
financial crisis, for New Haven residents, 
the downturn began three years earlier 
with a sharp dip in the housing market. 
Between 2007 and 20.08 alone, Elm City 
hqme sales dropped by 26.2 percent, well 
above the 16 percent national average. As 
the value of New Haveners' homes fell and 
the interest rates on their mortgages rose, 
the result was a record number of foreclo-
sures: 165 in 2007 and 360 in 2008, fol-
lowing an already shocking 130 percent 
hike in foreclosure rates between 2005 and 
2007. 

In response, Mayor John DeStefano 
gathered housing advocates from city non-
profits, community groups, and Yale Law 
School clinics to develop a coordinated re-
sponse to the city's housing crisis. He un-
veiled this team, called the Real Options 
Overcoming Foreclosure (ROOF) Project, 
at a press conference in City Hall at the 
beginning of May. "The foreclosure cri-
sis is affecting communities nationwide," 
DeStefano said at the gathering. "But in 
New Haven, we're working together to 
minimize the impact,Â· help families before 
they reach the point of foreclosure and ed.,. 
ucate our residents about creating wealth, 
understanding what they can afford~ and 
making trusted counseling services avail-
able to families in trouble." The ultimate 
goal, DeStefano made clear, was to "pro-
tect the vitality of our neighborhoods." 

The city is fighting an uphill battle. 
While Connecticut has suffered com-
paratively less than states like Nevada and 
Arizona, urban areas such as New Haven 
and Bridgeport, which have relatively 
weak job markets and high proportions 
of low-income housing, have been hit far 
harder than the rest of the state. In January 
alone, according to the online foreclosure 
database Realtytrac.com, there were 560 
newly foreclosed homes in New Haven. 
Hartford County came in a distant second 
with 387. By the end of2008, over 1,000 
lis pendens @ings 
the first legal step in 
foreclosure proceedings 
had been issued 
in New Haven, at nearly triple the rate of 
the previous year. 

"The effect has been huge," says James 
Paley, executive director of Neighborhood 
Housing Services of New Haven, a local 
non-profit that acquires and rehabilitates 
distressed properties in the city and resells 
them at affordable rates. "Each month is 
a record number of foreclosures over the 
month before." 

In january alone, there were 
560 newly foreclosed homes in 
New Haven. Hartford Coun-
ty came in a distant second

For Paley, the culprit in this crisis is 
clear: adjustable-rate sub-prime mortgage 
loans, or mortgages in which borrowers 
with poor credit ratings initially pay a low, 
fixed-rate interest on their loan, which 
then rises substantially after a set period 
of time. "One of the things people would 
be told," Paley recalls, "is, 'Yes, this is an 
adjustable rat~ mortgage and it will go 
up after two years, but the value of your 
property will keep going up and you'll be 
able to refinance to a fixed rate mortgage.' 
Well, when the housing market is strong 
that's fine, but when it drops people can't 
refinance and they're stuck in the adjust-
