DEAD RIGHT 
On November 
8 
in 
the 
Morse 
basement, 
mere 
blocks 
from 
where 
hundreds 
of Yale 
Democrats 
were 
celebrating Barack Obama's presidential 
win after weeks of intensive canvassing and 
phone-banking, a small gathering of Yale 
College Republicans ruefully watched 
the blue votes pour in. Only one YCR 
member had canvassed during the months 
leading up to the election.·

The YCR Yale's 
chapter of the 
Connecticut 
College 
Republicans-
struggled to garner participation during 
the presidential campaigns, even when 
Yale's 
generally left-leaning tendencies 
are taken into account. 12 percent ofYale 
undergrads, - or about 650 
students, 
described -
themselves -
as 
politically 
conservative in a recent Yale Daily News 
poll. This fall's freshman bazaar yielded an 
initial YCR panlist of about 250 names, 
but only about 15 members regularly 
attended the weekly meetings leading up 
to the elections. The traditional forums 
for conservative voices 
chiefly the Yale 
Political 
Union's 
three 
right-leaning 
parties, the Yale Daily News's editorial 
page, and the Yale Free Press 
still exist, 
but their participants often show little 
interest in the YCR. 

Conservatives 
at 
Yale, 
though 
a 
minority, are not a unified bloc. If the 
recent presidential elections are any 
indicator, many conservative Yalies don't 
adhere to strict Republican Party lines. 

Matthew Shaffer DC '10, a member of 
the Party of the Right and editor of the 
fale Free Press, abstained from voting in 
6 
November--a decision he now claims 
to regret-because he felt McCain was 
an "not an acceptable candidate." Many 
members 
of the 
right-leaning YPU 
parties felt similarly. Though there are few 
crossover YCR-YPU 
members, 
Chris 
Pagliarella 
BK 
'12, 
a ·self-described · 
moderate Republican and member of 
the YCR board, is one such anomaly. 

Pagliarella, 
however, 
participates -in 
the YPU through the Party _of the Left 
and asserts that though a "significant 
minority'' of the YPU's three conservative 
parties voted for Obama, he was the only 
conservative member of a liberal party to 
have voted for McCain. 

"It's very difficult to get excited about 
the Republican Party today," Shaffer 
says. He finds many aspects of the party's 
platform at odds with his conservative 
mindset and laments a lack of intellec-
tual leaders on social issues such as gay 
marriage and the choice to enter an 
unpredictable war. 

Jake McGuire PC '10, also of the 
Party of the Right, critiques McCain's 
selection of Sarah Palin as his vice-
- presidential candidate, saying he initially 
supported the Alaskan governor but grew 
to feel that "the Republican Party played 
too much to the populist base 
and I 
think people here resent that." 

Other YCR board members refrain 
from criticizing Republican Party ideol-
ogy, instead focusing their post-election 
analysis on specific policy issues. Trevor 
Wagener PC '11, for ins~ance, attributed 
much of the GOP's loss to its immigra-
tion policy, which he believes alienated an 
important constituency of Hispanic voters. 

Other board members focus on Obama's 
rhetorical choices, the media's focus on 
Obama's race, and the economic crisis as 
reasons for the Republicans' loss. 

One issue on which many Yale 
conservatives agree, however, is that the 
Republican Party 
and, by extension, 
the YCR 
is in bad shape. Current YCR 
President Tom Abell CC '10 suggests the 
Republican Party form national coalitions 
that would appeal to fiscal conservatives 
who often vote Democrat, as well -as to 
other strategic demographics. 

Other Yalies see the need for a more 
drastic ideological shift. "It's going to 
take a turn towards the intellectual side," 
says Courtney Pannell M C '11, a mem-
ber of the YCR .. "There is a big difference 
between younger conservatives and our 
parents .... We see how the party has 
to change: It has to be less monochro-
matic, less 1950s." Pannell thinks that 
Republicans 
must 
retain 
their more 
traditional base while also reaching out to 
"the progressive, younger generation." 

Pannell's 
suggestion 
reveals 
desire for a revival of campus conse-
vatism, an aspiration that is inexora-
bly linked with iconic Eli William F. 
Buckley, Jr. In 1951, when Buckley pub-
lished Man and God at Yale, a critique of 
what he saw as Yale's overarching liber-
alism, he identified an ideological void 
within the university community. Almost 
sixty years later, Yale conservatives feel 
a similar void not just on campus, but 
on the national political stage. They are 
waiting for their Barack Obama.

COACH CLASS 
The Yale Bowl wasn't always near-emp~ 
ty on Saturday afternoons. People didn't 
always tailgate past half-time; in fact, the 
very first game of recognizable American 
football between two U.S. universities-
Harvard and Yale 
took place in New 
Haven in 1875. It was a Yale man, Wal-
ter Camp, who later became known as the 
"father of American football," transform-
ing a brutal form of rugby into a whole 
new game. 

Looking at images of the Yale Bowl 
in the 1930s and '40s, Professor Charles 
Hill says, one gets a sense of the centrality 
of Yale football games as social occasions
