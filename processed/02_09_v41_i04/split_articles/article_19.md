EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
It's a Tuesday morning in February 
at the Village of Power, and Josephine is 
asking the women seated around her in a 
makeshift circle of chairs what they've done 
this week to turn a negative into a positive. 
The women, eleven in all, slump back into 
their sweatshirts and jackets. Although it's 
warm indoors, some are still wearing the 
. 
secondhand winter coats they got from the 
Columbus House shelter, where many will 
spend the night. No one speaks. Maybe 
it's a little too early in the day, or maybe 
the question is too difficult for the women 
to answer just yet. They have come to the 
VOP, an all-female treatment program run 
in the basement of the Hill Health Center 
on Dixwell Avenue, to seek legal, medical, 
and emotional support as they struggle to 
overcome the twin hurdles of homeless-
ness and substance abuse. 

Each woman who finds her way to the 
VOP is at a different step on the road tore-
covery, but all have certain things in com-
mon. All live below the poverty line; many 
have a history of incarceration, domestic 
abuse, and trauma; most, though not all, 
are racial minorities; 98 percent are un-
employed. Most of the women suffer from 
some form of illness, mental or physical,

that is often related to their addictions and 
exacerbated by their poverty: bipolar dis- . 
order, schizophrenia, HIV, diabetes. Pain 
of all degrees and all varieties tends to be 
a recurring problem among the clientele. 

Josephine isn't prepared .to accept si-
lence. As a veteran VOP caseworker, she 
leads a slew of trauma discussion groups, 
and she's anything but shy about getting 
the ball rolling. "Mary, would you care to 
tell· us one example of what you changed 
from a negative to a positive this week?" 
she asks a woman in jeans and a black 
parka. 

Mary responds slowly. "Keeping that 
right attitude, no matter what happens in 
my life," she says. She doesn't look older 
than forty, but she's missing most of her 
teeth. "I can't be a good example to my 
grandchildren and other children in the 
family if I'm going to be an addict. And 
I could be sent to jail by my parole officer 
for using and testing positive time after 
time." She pauses, then grows philosophi-
cal. "I could thank my lucky stars that I 
still have my freedom, and nothing gets 
better by using." 

"Give her a hand, people," Josephine 
calls out, eliciting <!- round of applause. A · 
woman sitting close to the room's back wall 
clears her throat. It's hard to hear her until 
Josephine tells her to speak up. Three of 
her family members have died within days 
of each other, she says, and she's struggling 
with the temptation to turn to alcohol to 
help her cope with her grief. The woman 
sitting next to her chimes in. She can un-
derstand what it's like, she says, rubbing 
her eyes. She still misses her mother, al-
though she died over twenty years before. 
The anniversary of her death is coming 
up soon. The women begin to talk at the 
same time, speaking at once to and over 
each other. 

'1 can't be a good example to 
my grandchildren and other 
children in the family if Im 
going to be an addict, " says 
• 
Mary. ':And I could be sent to 
jail by my parole o cer for us-
ing and testing positive time 
after time."

"You need to write a letter to your 
mother," Josephine tells the second wom-
an, cutting through the confusion, and 
when she replies that she already has, Jo-
sephine is ready with an answer: "Write 
another one, baby, until you feel that 
peace, 'cause you're not at peace with that. 
As time goes on and we get older, we have 
to come to peace with things in our past," 
she explains. "You are judged by your past, 
and you're going to have to live with your 
, 
past some more. 

JOSEPHINE OCCASIONALLY speaks in ab-
stractions, but her words are grounded in 
experience. Like many of the VOP's case-
workers, she herself is a recovered addict, 
and is intimately acquainted with the irre-
versible impact that addiction can have on 
a career and personal life. As she addresses 
the group, Josephine begins to talk about 
her own struggle to regain control over her 
life, to find a new job after her drug-relat-
ed criminal record made her ineligible for 
most career tracks. She knows what it's like 
to be judged by the past, and she tells it 
like it is: Recovery is hard, recovery is long, 
recovery is often lonely. Her voice is sharp 
and loud, but its sheer persistent force has 
a relaxing effect over the room. "I know 
what it is to sit up and cry and be upset 
about that urge, you know," she says. "It's 
real, something that I fight every day, what · 
is it, seven or eight years?" She pauses, and 
looks at the circle of women. ''And I feel 
really good about that." 

As Josephine goes on, it becomes harder 
and harder to distinguish her from a VO P 
client. She speaks with the authority of a 
caseworker and the confidence of someone 
who is sure of her own strength and ability 
to stay sober. Still, the stories she tells are 
deeply personal, and she makes no attempt 
to censor herself, or to pause her own nar-
rative so that others can share theirs. She 
is nothing like the stereotypical group 
leader of addiction recovery programs like 
Alcoholics Anonymous, that warm and 
fuzzy breed of mentor who speaks only 
positive platitudes. This, of course, is the 
point of the VOP's particular recovery 
model. The program installs caseworkers 
who understand their clients' experiences 
because they have lived them. Josephine, 
who wears her enthusiasm for her job at 
the VOP like a badge of honor, can hold 
herself up as living proof that it is possible 
not simply to conquer an addiction, but 
February 2009 
to go on to lead a fulfilling life. And she's 
anything but modest about the achieve-
. ment. "Do you mind if I give you a hug?" 
she asks one of the clients in the group. 

No one else has spoken for minutes; the 
proposed hug seems at once a caseworker's 
offer of comfort to the women she's trying 
to help and a client's vulnerable appeal for 
reassurance. "I tell ya, a hug a day keeps 
the doctor away, it's better than the apple. 
And a good smile will brighten a person's 
day, too." People nod. "You know, I feel as 
though when I walk in here I really add 
some burst of life to y' all. Get up! Get 
moving!" The women chuckle, but few 
move. "No?" Josephine asks. 

DESPITE THE FRAUGHT nature of many 
of its discussion groups, the VOP works 
hard to cultivate a casual, easy atmosphere. 
Women will often stop by just to say hello 
and chat for a minute, and the caseworkers 
leading discussions and group therapy ses-
sions call out to them to encourage them 
to sit and stay for a while, or to join the 
group and share their own stories. The cin-
derblock walls are painted a bright purple, 
the rooms decorated with clients' photo-
graphs, magazine-cutout collages, paint-
ings, and poems. A large wooden board 
is cut and painted to look like a woman 
dressed in Mrican-patterned fabrics. The 
sign she carries reads: "We are the women 
_ of the Village of Power 
strong, caring, 
spiritual, loving, funny, free. Village of 
Power is the strength for women in recov-
ery learning to overcome in daily battles."~ 

As the VOP's founder and director 
Sue Feldman will tell you, it's not a fancy 
place. Even in a normal economic climate, 
there would hardly be money to spend on 
things like furniture or decor. The tables 
and chairs that fill the main room where 
most of the group meetings take place are 
strictly utilitarian. But to regular clients, 
none of that seems to matter. The VOP 
has a warmth and openness to it that ob-
scures the windowless modesty of its phys-
ical space. It can seem worlds, rather than 
mere floors, away from the gray sterility of 
the clinic upstairs. 

If there is a model for the VOP, it is the 
one-room schoolhouse, in which students 
of all ages and skill levels interact and learn 
with one another, the more advanced ones 
nudging the novices along until they be-
come teachers in their own right. The Vil-
lage of Power purposefully softens the lines 
.. 
between authority figures and clients, the 
recovered and the recovering. Casework-
ers have been patients and talk honestly 
about the continued challenges of staying 
sober. As Josephine's own presence testi-
fies, it's more than possible for patients to 
transform, one day, into caseworkers. Even 
Sue's office, technically the most offiCial 
and private room at the VOP, is an open, 
almost communal space. Clients and case-
workers alike drop by to chat or ask for 
advice, and the door stays open almost all 
the time. "Sue does not take a day off," Jo-
sephine says with admiration. "Every time 
she takes her vacation, she incorporates it 
into business." 

Talking and listening are important, 
but doing and making things are equally 
stressed as practical modes of therapy. 
Across the hallway from the VOP's main 
room is Growing for Sewing, a program 
devoted entirely to clients' sewing and 
crafts projects. Bolts of fabric cover the 
tables and countertops of the large sewing 
room, and finished items hang on the walls 
as showpieces. Colorful wraps and shawls 
drape next to patterned shirts and pants; a 
handmade teddy bear or two surveys the 
scene. Johnnie-Anne and Comelita, two 
long-time VOP clients, sit at sewing ma-
chines, working on new projects and lis-
tening to religious songs drifting from the 
television: I know I don't deserve him, but 
I love him anyway. Praise him, praise him, 
praise him. 

~ time goes on and we get 
older; we have to come to peace 
with things in our past~ " says 
josephine. ccYou are judged by 
your past~ and youre going to 
have to live with your past 
some more. 

Comelita has been coming to the Vil-
lage of Power since 2006. Although she 
had known how to sew since she was a 
child, she hadn't worked a machine in 
thirteen years. Sewing, she found, helps 
to keep her mind occupied and focused 
on sobriety. She comes to the VOP every 
day, she says, "so I can get away, and have 
that free time to myself, instead of being 
at home with that free time and doing:--

-
other things." True to the VOP's model of 
empowerment, she now teaches sewing 
to other women who come in wanting to 
learn. Acquiring a skill and being able to 
teach it, Feldman says, helps women like 
Comelita believe that there was a point to 
their suffering 
that it has equipped them 
to understand and aid others like them. 

"I just love being in the sewing room," 
Johnnie-Anne says. "I just love being 
here." Like Comelita, she is a daily pres-
ence at the VO P, and has been coming 
for eight years. She came in with a: drug 
addiction and a serious violent streak, but 
she smiles now as she promises that she'll 
be here "until Sue tells me I got to go." 
If Sue gives her the go-ahead, she plans to 
start teaching a class in jewelry-making 
for women who have not yet advanced to 
the sewing room. The VOP has taught her 
how to make candles and soaps, and she's 
eager to learn more crafts. Johnnie-Anne 
wants to take her accumulated skills be-
yond the VOP basement, even beyond the 
regular crafts sales that the VOP sponsors 
every Friday, where its clients' work is sold 
to fund the purchase of more materials for 
the crafts-room and any personal items 
these clients might need, · ftom eyeglasses 
to bus passes (the women don't receive 
hard cash for their work, in case it might 
trigger a relapse). With the support of the 
VOP, Johnnie-Anne plans tO start her own 
craft-selling business in the basement of 
the home that she aspires to buy. Johnnie-
Anne realizes that this particular equation 
rests on a string of maybes, but, she says, 
the VOP has given her hope that this kind 
of self-sufficiency may soon be possible. 

The sewing room is one of the incen-
tives Feldman has developed to help her 
clients stay clean. When they first arrive 
at VOP, many of the women have anger 
management problems that compound 
their addictions. But, as they progress 
toward sobriety, clients who show a great 
deal of improvement in social skills and 
professionalism might be invited to work 
the reception desk. Being asked to moni-
tor the telephone is a sign of competence 
and responsibility, and Feldman reports 
that women will often argue with each 
other over who will get the job. "Rather 
than focus on illness, like you would do in 
a traditional therapy situation ... our whole 
approach is, <What do you love to do?"' 
she explains. "Rather than initially focus-
ing on deficits and weaknesses and prob-
24 
lems, first we focus on who you are, what 
are you strengths, what you iove to do." 

If there's a model for the VOR 
it is the one-room schoolhouse, 
in which students of all ages 
and skill levels interact and 
learn with one another, the 
more advanced ones· nudging 
the novices along until they 
become teachers in their own 
right. 

Feldman refuses to be discouraged by 
clients who, when they first enter the VOP, 
claim that they have no passions or skills. 
She'll direct them to start stringing beads, 
something that anyone can do. The mod-
est income that women like Johnnie-Anne 
and Comelita have begun to earn through 
the sale of their crafts demonstrates the 
immediate practical benefits that this 
kind of creativity can bring, but Feldman 
points to another, longer-lasting advan-
tage to a work-based approach to recovery.· 
"By finding her own strength and beauty, 
~ 
any woman can grow into age-appropriate 
tasks: being a parent, being a citizen, being 
an employee. It's a developmental process." 

She envisions a future for the VOP as a 
women's micro-business cooperative, in 
which each client will eventually be skilled 
enough to make 
and profit from-
crafts. "We want to be a movement," she 
says with a laugh, comparing the VOP 
to a company like the Body Shop, which 
started small and, by marketing a particu-
lar kind of natural and eco-friendly prod-
uct, grew into a massive franchise. "Buy 
things made by women in recovery who 
are homeless, because that will make your 
community a humane place, rather than 
supporting a big CEO-corporation," Feld-
man says. This goal has become a major fo-
cus of her organization, which recognizes 
that even women who have physically re-
covered from an addiction can't succeed in 
today's world without achieving economic 
independence. Until about ten years ago, 
Feldman explains, "the connection be-
tween work apd recovery wa5 very fuzzy, 
because programs are always stepped. Poli-
cy-makers would say, (First get them clean 
and sober, and address their mental health 
issues. Then they can go and train and get 
a job.' Well, that never made sense to me. 
What's the motivation for someone to get
