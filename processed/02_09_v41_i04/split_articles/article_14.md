New Haven veterans with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder move forward together. 
The first day Paul was in Vietnam, his 
company lined up to take pictures with a 
de~d enemy soldier. When Paul refused, 
they punished him. "They made me bury 
the guy," he said. "They weren't about to let 
me get away with not touching him." 
The rest of the group 
five veterans 
and a chaplain 
listen quietly, sitting in a 
scattered circle in the third-floor chapel of 
the West Haven Veteran's Administration 
Hospital. Leaning back in their seats with 
their legs crossed, they are just senling into 
a weekly interfaith group meeting for Post-
Traumatic Stress Disorder.

"Our innocence 
boy, we sure lost it 
quick," says Paul, both hands resting on 
his walker. 
"It's true, you know," Jeff chimes in. 
His head bobs gently as he speaks. "We 
were in high school, young, we didn't un-
derstand the world then. We didn't know 
what other life-paths were like. And then 
you· go to war, and you're not prepared.

Everything you see is so foreign to you. It's 
something that rocks the mind. We weren't 
,, 
Innocent anymore. 
Even today, Paul feels a sense of guilt. 
He says he's apologized to families in Viet-
nam, because he feels like he's the one who 
broke them apart and needs their forgive-
ness. 
The others nod in silence, but Hernan-
dez speaks out. "Forgiveness, what about 
it? If they don't exonerate us, then what?" 
Hernandez still recalls the first man he saw 
die, a Marine flipping through the nearby 
air 
Hernandez moves his index finger in 
a rolling motion to demonstrate. "They say 
the Lord'll take care of the guys you kill, 
sort 'em out, you know, pick the good 'uns 
and the bad 'uns. Some go to heaven, some 
go to hell. But what happens to me? What 
side am I on?"

you make yourself an object, and the other 
person an object. That's how you can kill. 
You detach yoursel£ And coming home, 
we had to detach ourselves again, because 
of the stigma associated with us. But at 
what price?" 
Father Sergei Bouteneff, the VA. chap-
lain, addresses the men calmly and indi-
rectly. He tells of something he learned 
from Native Americans in the Pacific 
Northwest, at a potlatch ceremony, in 
which a wealthy member of the commu-
nity treats everyone to a huge feast. One 
part of the ceremony entails taking a huge 
copper shield and breaking it apart, giving 
a piece to each person at the feast. Later, 
the host collects the pieces and melds 
them together in a display of ~nity. "Let's 
say this shield takes $1,000 to make," says 
the chaplain. "Well, it takes $2,000 to put 
it back together. And even when you do, 
it's not the same. That's the price we pay. 
It's like our innocence. We're trying now 
to buy it back, but the cost is high. And

We have to go after it. But we pay, we went 
to war at a price 
we pay extra, just like 
the shield." 
Part of that price is the fight against iso-
lation, as veterans try to piece their broken 
lives back together. 
P.T.S.D. 
PosT-TRAUMATIC 
STREss 
Disorder 
is a common mental illness 
amongst war veterans. It is an anxiety 
disorder brought on by a life experience 
a patient can't shake. Its four main symp-
toms, as described by the United States 
Department of Veterans Affairs, are re-
experiencing, avoidance, numbing, and 
arousal. The organization also estimates 
different percentages of veterans affected 
by P.T.S.D. for different wars: about 12 to 
20 percent for soldiers who served in Iraq, 
6 to 11 percent for those in Mghanistan, 
up to 10 percent for Gulf War veterans, 
and 30 percent for those who served in 
Vietnam. 
'1n war, you make yourself an 
object, and the other person 
an object. That's how you can 
kill " says Ron. "You detach 
yourself And coming home, 
we had to detach ourselves 
again, because of the stigma 
associated with us. But at 
Elliott Storm, a Vietnam veteran and 
author who is a regular patron of the West 
Haven V.A. Hospital, knows the isolation 
that P.T.S.D. can bring. His latest book, 
These Scars Are Sacred, features a vet haunt-
ed by memories of Vietnam; any little 
trigger 
a slow-moving car, crowds-can 
set off a flashback that Storm depicts in 
vivid, sometimes gruesome detail. "People 
from the outside say I'm raw," says Storm, 
whose voice, even on the pho~e, is fren-
zied: "But vets say I'm real. They say thank 
you, for telling the uuth. Thank you, for 
saying what we've been wanting to say." 
Storm insists he doesn't write his books for 
veterans themselves, but for their families, 
so that they can understand what the vet-
erans are going through and why so many 
are affiicted.
