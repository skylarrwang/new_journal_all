**Title: Ghosts of Bombay**

A month after gunmen stormed the 
Taj Mahal Hotel, I took a long-planned 
flight to Mumbai, India, to visit family. 
I hadn't seen the city in four years, but 
as my uncle drove us to his house in the 
suburbs, Mumbai looked the same. The 
traffic was still terrble; the skyscrapers 
swelled upward in the late-night sky; the 
smog was still thick enough to block out 
the stars. Even this late, some of the shops 
lining the perimeters of the slums were still 
open, little tiny places the size of a couple 
of refrigerators, held together by sheets of 
tarp and wooden sticks. 

Upon my return to Yale after the trip, 
a friend asked me, "How are people in 
Mumbai doing these days?" I imagined 
my uncle's response. He would have told 
my friend what he had been so eager to 
tell me, even as we drove away from the 
airport that first night: that Bombay (as 
most of us still call it) has not changed. 
The day after 26/ 11, he insisted, in a 
refrain that I would hear throughout my 
stay and that I found myself repeating to 
my friend, people went back to work. Life 
returned to normal. 

As we passed the crowded 
Leopold Cafe, she turned to 
me, wide-eyed: "This is where 
people 
were 
shot!" South 
Bombay wasn't a ghost town, 
but we were all seeing ghosts. 
A cousin of mine who lost a friend 
at the Oberoi, one of the hotels targeted 
in the 26/11 attacks, echoed my uncle's 
words. She and her husband live in Bandra 
West, a suburb in Central Bombay that is 
a popular tourist destination in itself-
but 
on our first night out, she took us to South 
Bombay, the area that was hit. We walked 
along Marine Drive, a road that follows 
the arc of the coast along the Arabian Sea. 
Nightlife was as lively as it had ever been: 
People streamed out of markets and bars 
and restaurants to perch on the sidewalk 
railing by the sea, dangling their feet over 
the water. But the shadow of the attacks 
was everywhere. "Helmet and Bulletproof 
Vest Recommended for all Mumbai-ites," 
read a sign posted outside Jazz by the Bay, 
a famous pizzeria and music club. None 
of us understood why it had been posted 
there or why someone had not yet taken it 
down. When we reached Nariman Point 
at the southern tip of Marine Drive, my 
cousin pointed out the Oberoi tower 
behind us with its boarded-up windows. 
As we passed the crowded Leopold Cafe, 
she turned to me, wide-eyed: "This is 
where people were shot!" South Bombay 
wasn't a ghost town, but we were all seeing 
ghosts. 

ON DECEMBER 21, the Taj and the 
Oberoi reopened their doors in a VIP-only 
event. As actors and politicians gathered 
for high tea, Indian newspapers trumpeted 
Bombay's speedy recovery and celebrities 
applauded the hotels as enduring symbols 
of the city's spirit. 

The Taj was 
India's 
first 
luxury 
hotel, built in 1903 for a quarter of a 
million pounds. It has always been one my 
clearest memories of Bombay and a favor-
ite spot to visit when I go back. Guards 
in snappy uniforms would open the 
entrance doors to reveal a richly furnished 
lobby with marble tables and a ceiling 
peppered with skylights. Men in dark suits 
would lounge in plush chairs, speaking in 
soft voices, probably talking business. I 
had always loved the restaurant, with cups 
of tea at 200 rupees (about $4) a pop, non-
bottled water that was safe to drink, and 
desserts with umbrellas sticking out of them. 
Although I didn't admit it to myself at the 
time, the Taj was a haven, a retreat from 
the outside world, from the smog and the 
blaring horns and the children selling fake 
paperback bestsellers and wilted flower 
bouquets on the side of the road. 

We visited the Taj a few days after it 
re-opened. As soon as we emerged from 
the auto we saw a long line, of at least 
fifty or sixty people, stretching all the way 
down the block. It took us a few minutes to 
realize that people were waiting to get past 
a security barricade and onto the Apollo 
Bunder, the pier across from the Taj. 
When we finally reached the front door 
of the building, a security guard stood 
beside the front steps, pointing a rifle at 
our heads, just in case. 

Inside, we ordered tea. I wanted to 
feel normal; we all wanted to feel normal, 
to talk with ease. But the conversations 
around us inevitably turned toward the 
attacks. A person at the table next to us 
remarked that the gunmen had stormed 
the place as guests were settling in for 
dinner. At that point, my cousin excused 
herself and went to the bathroom. My 
mother and I followed her. 

Even just meters from shore, 
the palace wing of the Taj, 
which will take several months 
to repair, looked untouched. 
My mother eagerly hurried inside the 
bathroom, nostalgic for the days when she 
was small, when her father would bring 
her to South Bombay and to this hotel and 
to this little room, which in a city teeming 
with dirt and mud was an icon of all things 
clean. Inside the bathroom, everything is 
pure white: white-tiled floor, stall doors 
with a white glossy finish, white marble 
sinks, faucets plated in white gold. When 
we had washed our hands, the attendant, 
a slight, bony-handed woman in a faded 
sari, handed us white towels to dry them. 
Unthinkingly I dropped the towel into the
wastebasket; she retrieved it before I had a 
chance to apologize. 

My cousin asked the woman if she had 
been on duty on 26/ 11. She replied that 
she had; she had hidden in her corner by 
the marble white counter for more than 
ten hours before daring to venture out-
side. I imagined her peeking outside the 
door, into a hallway lit with crystal chan-
deliers, for a moment before retreating. 
Perhaps she saw the shadow of a gunman's 
haggard face or of the barrel of a rifle pass 
over the portrait of Neil Armstrong, one of 
the Taj's many illustrious visitors. The flash 
of high heels across a wide, rich red carpet 
followed by heavy black boots. A body, 
half-hidden from view by a display case 
with shattered glass doors. She might 
have seen all this before retreating to her 
enclave, to the white walls and the white 
sinks and the white towels. 

JUST TWENTY OR THIRTY feet out from 
the Taj is the Arabian Sea. From other 
vantage points along the coast, it appears 
a dirty grey and brown from a mixture of 
mud and trash. But from the hotel, a bit 
farther out than the public beaches, the 
water sparkles like shattered glass. As we 
walked out of the Taj that day after tea, the 
tips of docked yachts and cruise ships and 
sailboats bobbed gently up and down in 
the afternoon sun. A cluster of triangular 
flags that distinguished a group of fish-
ing boats rapidly receded in the distance. 
Authorities have speculated that it was 
by hijacking such a boat as it left from 
Karachi, Pakistan, that gunmen were able 
to reach the shores of Bombay. 

We hired a small sailboat at the pier 
from an old man with blackened teeth to 
take us out to sea. Even just meters from 
shore, the palace wing of the Taj, which 
will take several months to repair, looked 
untouched. The Gateway of India, built 
to commemorate the visit of King George 
V and Queen Mary to India in 1911, 
arched impressively to its right. Designed 
to present an imperial first glimpse of 
India to travelers approaching by sea, it 
now blocked any view of security barriers 
or policemen. As the sun began to set, we 
watched tiny lights in each window of the 
Taj's palace wing begin to take form. 

When celebrities or politicians speak 
of the Taj as an enduring symbol of the 
city's spirit or dignity, I imagine that they 
envision something like what we saw that 
night, a palace lit with candles beside 
a tall and imposing archway worthy of 
welcoming a royal monarch. The Taj, like 
the Gateway, is meant to be seen from 
the water. Imperial visitors could step 
directly off the dock through its majestic 
waterfront doors. Perhaps they never 
even saw the rest of the city, what lies just 
behind the Apollo Bunder, the smog and 
crowded streets and beggars' outstretched 
hands. 

How are the people of Bombay doing 
these days? They've gone back to work. 
The restroom attendant still bends down 
to pick up the white towels that visitors 
accidentally throw in the dustbin. Chil-
dren still pound on car windows waving 
fake copies of *The White Tiger* in the 
middle of stalled street traffic. The security 
guard shoulders his rifle and heads to work 
at the Taj every morning. 

What else does it mean to endure?
