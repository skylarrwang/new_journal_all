EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
treatment has become impossible to ig-
nore. Hospitals like the West Haven V.A. 
have responded in kind, increasingly turn-
ing to chaplains' programs, mental health 
care, and creative therapy. But many vets 
worry that this won't be enough. 
"How much can you art? How much 
can you sing? How much can you laugh 
and write and do any of those things?" 
says Storm. "A reporter once said to me, 
'Didn't you find your book a catharsis?' I 
said, 'Absolutely not!' Writing doesn't help 
me .... There ·is no cure for what I have. 
Sure, there are drugs, but there is no cure. 
There's no magic pill." · 
• 
With more and more people 
om Iraq and A -
returnzng 
· ghanistan wounded instead 
of killed, and with the sur-
vivability rate of the military 
today higher than it has ever 
been, veterans' need for psy-
chological treatment has be-
come impossible to ignore. 
Dana Murphy, Storm's commanding 
officer within one of Connecticut's Ameri-
can Legion chapters, agrees that the book . 
is no substitute for medical treatment. 
"He's writing this book, but he needs help, 
too," he says. "He sees a shrink every Mon-
d 
" 
ay. 
Sometimes, the writing and the treat-
ment feed off of each other. When Storm's 
psychologist told him to write down a re-
curring war dream he'd been having, he 
ended up pounding out 65 single-spaced 
pages on a typewnter. 
But telling the truth can alienate as 
many people as it attracts. ·Storm's wife 
of 25 years left him when he started re-
immersing himself in his war experiences 
through writing. "It's called secondary 
P.T.S.D.," says Storm. "I rub off on my 
wife and my kids." He remembers a pic-
ture of him that his son, Christian, drew 
at age 13. "It was a monster-looking man 
holding a chain saw and on the bottom it 
said, 'What I say go,"' says Storm. "After I 
stopped crying, I told my son, 'Draw me 
a picture of you.' And you know what he 
drew? He drew me a picture of a sacrificial 
February 2009 
lamb." Regarding his books, his other son 
asked him, "Daddy? Do me a favor. Don't 
al 
use our re 
name. 
So "Elliott Storm" is actually a pseud-
onym, yet one so powerful that even his 
Closest friends and his second wife call him 
Elliott. As for the real Elliott Storm? He's 
a cat. 


IN THE LOBBY of the West Haven V.A. 
Hospital is a single quotation, stark and 
striking above the information desk, in 
silver metallic lettering: "The price of free-
dom is visible here." But maybe it's not so 
visible after all. 

Storm tells me, "It's not that you have 
to understand. I talk to psychiatrists, psy-
chologists. I ask 'em, 'What are the first 
things you tell these people who come 
in to see you, these veterans?' Is it 'Oh, 
we know this or we know that?' Because 
that's not what veterans want to hear. 
You tell them what you think, what you 
know about P.T.S.D. and everything, and 
they turn away from you. You know what 
a veteran wants to hear? Just two words: 
'Welcome home.' If I know someone was 
a Vietnam vet, iftheywerewearin' a hat or 
somethin', I always go up to them and say, 
'Welcome home, brother.'" 

At his office in the V.A., Father 
Bouteneff tells me, "I don't try to hide 
the fact that I never served." He got an F4 
from a medical exam 
meaning that he 
was physically disqualified 
and later a 
Yl, which excused him from duty while 
- he was a seminary student. Still, in his 
therapy sessions with P.T.S.D. groups, he 
doesn't hesitate to use the word ~'we." "War 
is about us versus them," he tells his vet-
eran patients. 

And his patients, many of whom he's 
been working with for over twenty years 
now, tell him, "We served for three years. 
You're serving for 25." 

"Spirituality is about relationships," 
Father Bouteneff says. He draws me a pic-
ture: a messy triangle labeled withY (You), 
0 (Other), and HP (Higher Power) on 
top. He draws arrows connecting all three 
to each other. "You don't have to under-
stand right away. But it's about trying to 
understand others, to sympathize, empa-
thize." He draws a final arrow from the Y 
back to itself in a circle. "And about under-
standing yourself" 


THE ERRERA CoMMUNITY Care Center, 
just down the hill from the West Haven 
V.A. and also part of the V.A. Connecticut 
Healthcare System, is working to change 
veterans' perceptions of themselves, and 
·each other, with more than just words. 

Walking into a brick building with a fac-
tory-like facade, I see artwork: photogra-
phy in memory of a vet. But upstairs, on 
the second floor, is where the healing really 
happens. 

Dr. Laurie Harkness, founder and di-
rector of the Errera Community Care 
Center, seeks to hire veterans for her staff 
of peer facilitators and counselors. "These 
people are mentally ill, have been home-
less, even," she says. "But you would never 
know it." When I explain that I am inter-
ested in the process of recovery for veter-
ans, Dr. Harkness lights up. 

The Errera Community Care Center 
addresses community integration in a style 
more hands-on and less structured than 
most mental health centers could imagine. 
"Most mental health places, they're try-
ing to establish more of a medical. model," 
says Moe Armstrong, a veteran who spe-
cializes in mental health work and is writ-
. 
ing a book profiling the Center's 17 peer 
specialists; he jots down notes even as I 
ask questions. "They have psychiatrists, 
nurses," he explains. "Well, you need that. 
You need clinical people, but you also need 
people workin' with people. Just need peo-
ple talkin' to each other. That's why this 
place got the best of both worlds, the clini-
cal stuff' 
the Center boasts psychiatrists, 
·including Dr. Harkness, who teach at the 
Yale School of Medicine 
"and people 
trying to get each other. And by having 
mentally ill people act as peers, that's ther-
apy for them, too. The future of mental 
health is here." 

James Murphy and Lewis Andrews are 
both peer advisors as well as Vietnam vet-
erans; they co-teach a class called HOPE: 
How One Progresses Everyday. Before tak-
ing early retirement, Murphy managed to 
work on and off for 22 years after he got 
back from the war. After he stopped work-
ing, though, he got mixed up with a crowd 
that fostered his drug addiction. He was 
homeless by 2004, when he was diagnosed 
with P.T.S.D. at the V.A .. "I'm not trying 
to justify everything with my P.T.S.D.," he 
says. But the facts are there: Since his di-
agnosis, he hasn't used drugs; and he's no 
14 
longer homeless. When he first found out, 
though, he was scared. "When they first 
told me I had P.T.S.D.; I was like, 'What's 
that?' I thought they were tryin' to label 
me, you know. I was scared. When you 
get screwed over so many times, when the 
V.A. did want to help you, you got a bit 
leery. That why a lot of us stayed out and 
became homeless. We had no confidence 
that the V.A. was tryin' to help us." 

Lew Andrews needs even more help · 
than Murphy: He was blinded by a mine 
while operating a tank in Vietnam. "This 
center is tryin' to help the guys accept the 
condition they're goin' through. Or maybe 
not accepted, no," says Andrews. "I mean, 
more like adjust. I've adjusted to being 
blind, I ain't gon' get used to it, but I can 
work to a positive end." · 

"When they first told me I 
had P. T.S.D., I was like, 
'What's that?"' says ·Murphy. 
'1 thought they were . trying 
to label me, you know. I was 
scared. When you get·screwed 
over so many times, when the 
VA did want to help you, you 
got a bit leery." 

When Andrews first came to the Cen-
ter to work, after getting a bachelor's de-
gree in psychology at Gateway College, 
the administrators asked him, "What do 
you think you could bring to this center 
to help?" 

''I'm the· type of person who needs that 
type of stuff," says Andrews. Like many 
vets, he wants to feel needed. 

A typical peer advisor teaches four 
classes a week on anything from anger 
management, to social interactions, to 
finding jobs. Peer-to-peer counseling gives 
mentally ill veterans a sense of purpose, 
even amidst difficulties. "Some morn-
ings, I just don't want to come to work," 
says Anthony Dozier, another peer advi-
sor at the center who specializes in find-
ing veterans jobs under the government's 
supportive employment policies. "I don't 
know how to explain it. It's overwhelming. 
I force myself out of bed sometimes." But 
he gets up because he has a responsibility 
to other veterans. "The benefit of me hav-
ing a mental illness is that I can relate. A 
lot of vets" 
Dozier served in Iraq 
"are 
like me." They want to isolate themselves, 
stay in bed. They don't like authority. Ev-
erything's a threat to them. They can't find 
or keep a job. "Well, then I start sharin' my 
story with them. They see that I'm at work 
every day. That inspires them." And so, 
when Dozier looks for jobs for veterans, he 
considers the conditions he himself faces. 

When a veteran tells him he is too anxious 
to have an interview that day, Dozier re-
schedules with the employer. He explains 
the situation to potential employers and 
entreats them to give the vet a chance. 

"It's a part-time job that just gets 'em 
out of the house," says Dozier. "The worst 
-
thing for mental illness is to isolate. With a 
mental illness, you hide from the world. If 
you get 'em out of the house, there's less of 
a chance for relapse." And unlike other job 
employment programs, Dozier's support 
is ongoing. "I don't want you to just get 
your thing goin' on and leave you. I stick 
with you. I support you and keep coming 
to check in on you," Dozier says. "As long 
as a vet wants me to keep comin', I keep 
co min'. And there's this sense of being part 
of a team, too 
Tony's team. That's what 
soldiers like." 

But since there are just two supportive 
employment peer advisors at the Center, 
there's not enough of Dozier to go around. 
And as Moe Armstrong points out, this isn't 
just a problem in New Haven 
there are 
not enough Doziers or Andrews or Mur-
phys throughout the country. Armstrong, 
who wants to bring this sort of peer-to-peer 
interaction and support to mental health 
institutions nationwide, is working on a 
national vet-to-vet program. 

The mental health system has been slow 
to accept this approach. "This center, this is 
it," says Armstrong, who has visited simi-
lar clinics across the country. "60 percent 
of the people who go through this center 
don't return to homelessness. That's the 
highest in the V.A. system. Nationally, 
you'd be lucky if you get half that." 

Armstrong has been working with men-
tal healthcare .on and off for 'twenty years 
and has two master's degrees in the field. 
Before that, he spent twenty years wander-
ing after his service in Vietnam, drifting 
from place to place, getting high, not real-
izing how common mental illness was for 
veterans. In 1984, when he was accepted 


to college, "the V.A. wouldn't pay for me 
to have a degree in social work," he says. 
"They wanted me to hide. The counselors 
were afraid of what would happen if I were 
to speak my feelings." So he got a bach-
elor's in business administration instead; 
he says he'll probably work until he drops 
dead. 

All of Armstrong's wandering, though, 
has taken a toll on him. "Sometimes I still 
feel like the odd guy out," he says. "Like 
I'm rough around the edges, you know." 

''Hey now," says Murphy. "Sometimes 
the odd guy out is the one that gets the ball 
rollin' ... even if sometimes the ball rollin' 
can knock the odd guy out." 

They chortle, but the statement rings 
true, and this is precisely what the Errera 
Community Care Center is: the odd guy 
out, trying to get the ball to roll. And more 
people are starting to roll along. 

KEN HARBAUGH, executive director of 
the Center for Citizen Leadership, a non-
profit dedicated to providing veterans with 
resources to be "leaders back home," is one 
of the rollers. "Even those coming home 
wounded feel like they have something left 
to give," says Harbaugh. "They don't want 
to feel like they're charity cases. So our first 
thought shouldn't be, 'What can I do to 
help them?' It's, 'What can we do to reen-
gage them productively in society?"' 

Harbaugh lives in New Haven, but 
the Center for Citizen Leadership works 
nationwide integrating veterans into the 
community as full-time volunteers for or-
ganizations from the National Park Service 
to Brothers and Sisters or local nonprofits. 
Many veterans receive subsidies from the 
CCL as a way to supplement their service 
checks while allowing them to do com-
munity work. As for the organizations for 
which the veterans volunteer, Harbaugh 
says, "At first, · they really feel like they're 
doing these guys a favor. But it doesn't 
take very long at all for them to realize that 
these people have so much left to offer." 

"Our first thought> >J says Har-
baugh> "shouldnt be> cWhat 
can I do to help them?> Its, 
'What can we do to reengage 
them productively in society?»' 


A bill introduced in the Senate in the ·· 
fall of 2008 as an amendment to the Na-
tional and Community Service Act of 
1990 proposes a strategy similar to Har-
baugh's. Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch's 
Serve America Act would, among other 
things, provide a government-funded vet-
eran's fellowship that would encourage 
veterans to engage m commumty servtce. 
The Obama administration has already 
signaled support for it. 

"The veterans' story is one of continu-
ing service," says Harbaugh, himself a vet 
who attended Duke and then Yale Law 
School after returning from his tours. 
"These guys have been told by the military 
that they've done their part, they can sit 
back now and be taken care of, but that's 
not a way to live for anybody, much less 
the kinds of people who were willing to 
risk their lives to serve." Harbaugh and, 
now, the American government, recog-
nizes the role of service in healing. 

AT THE END of the group meeting at 
the West Haven V.A., one man says he 
wants to join one of the service projects 
going back to Vietnam, to help rebuild 
the place he once destroyed. That will be 
his continuing service, and part of his re-
covery. Another man says he would never 
be able to do that, to go back there, but 
that he fully supports the other vet. "And 
in doing that, in you telling him, 'I sup-
port you,"' says Father Bouteneff to the 
second man, "a little part of you is going 
back with him."

For these veterans, like the pieces of the 
potlatch shield, recovery cannot exist in 
isolation.
