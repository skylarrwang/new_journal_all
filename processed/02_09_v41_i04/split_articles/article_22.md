the words and the images contradict them-
selves also creates a productive tension, by 
asking the viewer to resolve the conflict 
and thus bring his or her thinking process 
and point of view into play."
. Though de Bretteville still prizes the 
subjectivity of the designer and the intel-
ligence of the viewer, she no longer views 
these factors through the lens of gender .. 
"When I first began, in 1969, to think 
about questioning what gender has to do 
with how women make . things," she re-
called recently, "I really enjoyed the ques-
tion-asking aspect of it because it meant 
thinking, it meant feeling, it meant really 
looking at experience ·as well as what has 
been written about gender .... At one point 
in the '80s, before I came back to Yale, I 
thought it was useful to call that act 'femi-
nist design' because it's so easy to discount 
gender as being participant in this discus-
sion. I still think that's conceptually im-
portant, but how you do it now, it's worth 
considering."
How Svendsen is doing it is indicative 
of a new feminist era less focused on gender 
differences and more focused on how gen-
der affects the day-to-day live$ of both men 
and women. While her work employs de 
Bretteville's multiple-perspective and view-
er-engagement strategies, it is also steeped 
in the Swiss Style de Bretteville was ques-
tioning and, as director of Yale's graphic 
design program, replacing. Svendsen uses 
bold, simple fonts arranged on strict grids, 
and her posters are recognizably crisp and 
readable, but in no way does she consider 
these stylistic choices inherently male or 
female. Her feminism emerges not in the 
style of her work the medium 
but in 
its content 
the message.
On January 15, 
Svendsen posted 
anonymous reader comments taken from 
the Yale Daily News website. She hori-
zontally anchored her display with the 
large phrase, "Your comments here." Iri a 
grid set over and around this phrase, she 
arranged the comments, all responding 
to last year's most explosively gendered 
events: Zeta Psi's online posting of a photo 
of twelve pledges standing in front of the 
Yale Women's Center holding a sign that 
read "We love Yale sluts," and Aliza Sh-
varts DC '08's projected artistic rendering 
of a series of self-induced abortions. These 
comments expressed everything from a 
reluctance to associate with the. Women's 
Center 
"Women constitute 50o/o of the 
28 
student body ... Please don't think that 
just because you are part of an institu-
tion that calls itself the Women's Center 
you have the right to speak for all women 
at Yale"
to misogynistic jokes 
"How 
many feminists does it take to screw iri a 
lightbulb? Two: One to screw it in and one 
to suck my penis." The juxtaposition of 
varying texts and perspectives creates· the 
kind of"productive tension" de Bretteville 
cited as a way to critically engage viewers 
and prompt the questions of difference 
needed to address gender disparity and 
discrimination, whether or not Svendsen's 
style was originally developed by men.
In using graphic design to 
provoke 
discussion 
about 
eminism on campus~ ·Svend-
sen takes a functionalist ap-
proach to her art. ·
FEMINIST DIALOGUE these days, both 
within and without the art world, tends 
to center on glass ceilings rather than on 
gendered perspectives. At a ·much-talked 
about New York panel on book design, 
one of the questions submitted to panel-
ists Milton Glaser, Dave Eggers, and Chip 
· Kidd asked why there were so few "su-
perstar" female graphic designers. Kidd 
broke the awkward silence .with a Larry 
Summers · joke, and then Glaser asserted 
that women miss out on foundational 
career opportunities by choosing to stay 
home and raise children.
·This incident sparked uproar in many 
circles, especially within the design world. 
Michael Bierut, a senior critic at the Yale 
Art School and moderator of the contro-
versial panel discussion, reacted on his 
award-winning blog, Design Observer. In 
a post titled "The Graphic Glass Ceiling," 
Bierut acknowledged gender imbalance at 
his own design firm and contemplated the 
possibility that Glaser; despite his archaic 
phrasing, might have spoken a shred of 
truth.
Jessica Helfand, who founded Design 
Observer with Bierut and also serves as a 
senior art critic at Yale, certainly thinks 
that lifestyle choices weigh heavily on 
women graphic designers. While design-
ing the New York Times's first website, 
Helfand became pregnant with her first · 
of two children. Wary of endangering 
her job, she did her best to hide her preg-
nancy. "I think it's a very female thing to 
assume that one thing would stand in the 
way of the other," she says, "or that there's 
a dissonance."
A recent Graphic Feminism install-
ment tackled the proverbial glass ceiling 
within the glass walls of the Bass Library 
cafe, one of several places where it was in-
stalled. Svendsen, who has worked exten-
sively with the Women's Faculty Forum,

compiled statistics on everything from 
tenured women, to maternity leave poli-
cies, to the number of reported sexual as-
saults on campus, arranging the numbers 
in mathematical columns that add up to 
a blank space next to the words, "Number 
ofYale students who identify as feminist."
Svendsen herself identifies as a femi-
nist, thought not necessarily as a feminist 
graphic designer. In using graphic design 
to provoke discussion about feminism on 
campus, she takes a functionalist approach 
to her art. A recent display on· the topic of 
the Women's Center was not only cleanly 
laid out, with asymmetrical space, a central 
women's restroom symbol, and striking or-
ange accents 
it was successful in spark-
ing dialogue about feminism at Yale. This 
installation, which displayed anonymous 
statements from six Yale women who iden-
tified as feminists but took issue with the 
Women's Center, drew more comments 
· on Graphic Feminism's blog than any 
other post. Some of these comments were, 
clearly, from current or former Women's 
Center board members, but many of them 
were from men or women who chose not 
to associate with the Center. All were re-
spectful of the other comments 
a stark 
contrast to the YDN comments Svendsen 
used in her earlier installation 
and much 
of the stream was back-and-forth and re-
garded specific Women's Center policy or 
events. This, for the most part, is the kind 
of constructive dialogue Graphic Femi-
nism seeks to incite.
Perhaps we no longer need to talk _ 
about how gender affects perception and 
presentation, or, as de Bretteville implied, 
perhaps this need varies according to an 
individual's personal trajectory. But at 
Yale, today, there is an urgent need for dis-
cussion about feminism. There is a need 
for Graphic Feminism.
