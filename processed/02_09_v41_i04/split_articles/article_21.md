THE 
Rl 

Yale is covered in text. I don't always see 
it and I don't always read it, but it's all over 
buildings, statues, bulletin boards, por-
traits, and signs. It's often titular: "John 
C. Calhoun," "Nathan Hale," "James 
Woolsey," "Kingman Brewster." It's often 
institutional: "The Yale Political Union," 
"Mory's," "The Whiffenpoofs." Recently, 
it's often been hateful: "N****r," "sluts." 

For Jessica Svendsen MC '09, this text 
is also masculine, connoting a mostly male 
institutional history and culture. When, 

26 

this January, she began printing words on 
sheets of paper and piecing them into grids 
on bulletin boards across campus 
in Lin-
sley-Chittenden and William Harkness 
Halls, on Cross Campus, on Old Campus, 
on Rose Walk 
she was re-covering Yale 
with text she hoped would actively make 
visual and conceptual space for women. 

First, she recalls, she had to blanket a 
masculinized history with its feminine 
counterpart. "One of the things that has 
worried me during my time here is the lack 
of institutional memory," Svendsen says, 
her slow, flat voice presenting her thoughts 
in an elegant grid. "Yes, we're only here for 
four years, but we're not aware of what has 
happened to women since 1969. Because 
there is no knowledge of history or recov-
ering of history, we make the same mis-
takes." In order to assert this alternate his-
tory, she combed through Yale Daily News 
and University archives and read articles 
and reports related to women at Yale. She 
then excerpted parts of these articles and, 
in striking white font, set them on a black 
timeline from 1969 to 2009. This timeline, 
which Svendsen printed in 8.5-by-11-inch 
sections and arranged in 1 02-by-44-inch 
displays on bulletin boards across campus, 
was the first installation of a graphic de-
sign project she has titled "Graphic Femi-
nism." Svendsen, an English major who 
takes graphic design classes and designs for 
several Yale organizations, began work on 
the project last semester. She obtained an 
Amy Rossborough Fellowship for service 
affecting women in New Haven and began 
rooting through archives, as well as inter-
viewing undergraduate women about their 
experiences with feminism at Yale. 

Svendsen's project is historically satu-
rated, both with the history of women 
at Yale and with the history of women in 
art. In the 1960s and '70s, as the women's 
liberation movement caught fire in the 
American political, social, and cultural 
spheres, women began to make feminist 
. art. An made by women, or even art 
THE NEW JOURNAL 


made by women with a feminist intent, 
was not new, but this art was different. It 
was a movement in which, as Washington 
Post critic Blake Gopnik recalled in 2007, 
"the message has mattered as much as the 
medium." Feminist artists challenged the 
traditional idea of the sacred art object and 
began to include voices and perspectives 
that had historically been silenced. In the 
field of graphic design, this meant display-
ing multiple perspectives in one design, 
breaking down the structured modernist 
grid to reveal the artist's subjectivity, and 
cognitively engaging the viewer. 

The message-over-medium approach 
was 
and 
is 
nowhere 
more 
present 
than in the work of the Guerilla Girls, 
a group of gorilla mask-wearing female 
artists founded in the 1980s that attacks 
gender and racial discrimination in poli-
tics and the art world using intervention-
ist, often illegal posters, stickers, and bill-
boards. Their designs are not meant to be 
savored in a museum but rather to catch 
the eye of a pedestrian and force him or 
her to think about societal structures in a 
new way. One of the Guerilla Girls' most 
famous campaigns, in 1989, featured In-
gres's Odalisque wearing a gorilla mask 
and flanking the text: "Do women have to 
be naked to get into the Met. Museum? 
Less than 5o/o of the artists in the Modern 
Art sections are women, but 85Â°/o of the 
nudes are female." The poster is shaded a 
shocking yellow and purple, its typeface a 
simple black shot through with pink for 
emphasis. 

Svendsen's unauthorized postering can't 
help but recall the Guerilla Girls, and in 
many ways, her posters reflect their de-
signs. A key component of Graphic Femi-
nism is its blog, which Svendsen updates 
frequently under a pseudonym; in person, 
"Grid Girl"'s cat-eye glasses cut an ap-
propriately graphic image across her arc-
ing forehead. When she tells me about 
her project, she uses the term "guerrilla'' 
more than once. Having long navigated 
Yale's postering policies, Svendsen simul-
taneously honors and trashes them with 
Graphic Feminism. University regulations 
allow one 8.5-by-11-inch poster per item 
on each of its official bulletin boards, so 
Svendsen divides her installation into 
twenty or thirty 8.5-by-11-inch chunks 
and then staples them over other flyers. 
"'When you take up the entirety of a bul-
letin board to make people think about 
women at Yale," she explains, "that inserts 
women into the campus space and makes 
people talk about it. When I post the de-
signs up and cover space, then, in a way, 
I'm making space for women." Her posters 
are often removed by Yale Recycling mere 
hours after she installs them, but this, of 
course, is part of the fun. 

"When you take up the entire-
ty o a bulletin board to make 
people think about women 
at Yale, " Svendsen explains, 
cthat inserts women into the 
campus space and makes peo-
ple talk about it." 

SHEILA 
LEVRANT 
DE 
BRE'ITEVILLE, 
current director of the Yale Art School's 
graphic design program, coined the term 
"feminist design" in the 1970s. After earn-
ing her M.F.A. at Yale in 1964, de Brette-
ville went on to upend the design world, 
founding the first design program for 
women at CalArts as well as Los Angeles's 
legendary Woman's Building, a feminist 
art and culture center, in 1971. When she 
was tapped as director ofYale's design pro-
gram in 1990, becoming the first tenured 
woman at the Art School, her radical theo-
_ries prompted the resignations of several 
of the School's more traditional faculty 
members. 

Throughout the latter half of the twen-_ 
tieth century, Yale had been a center of 
the International or Swiss Style, often 
characterized by dean, readable grids and 
strong sans serif fonts, and developed al-
most entirely by men. De Bretteville, who 
had been trained in this style as a graduate 
student at Yale, wanted to "honor the in-
telligence of the viewer rather than talking 
at the viewer," she remembers. By engag-
ing artist and viewer in a kind of dialogue, 
de Bretteville called both parties' genders, 
and how these genders might affect their 
perspectives, into question. 

"Feminist design looks for graphic 
strategies that will enable us to listen to 
people who have not been heard from be-
fore," de Bretteville said in a 1990 dialogue 
with designer Ellen Lupton. Recalling 
feminist design strategies she'd pursued in 
the '80s, de Bretteville continued "Having
