recognize. For most of its time at Yale, it 
has gathered dust in the Beinecke Rare 
Book and Manuscript Library, an im-
ponderable hidden from sight. Recent-
ly, however, it caught the eye of some 
documentary producers 
interested in 
making a film about it. Scrambling 
to update and expand the document's 
profile, the Beinecke librarians brought it 
to Sterling Memorial Library's conserva-
tion laboratory. Here, two outside special-
ists are analyzing the pigments in its ink 
and carbori dating a tiny sample of its 
vellum. "There are people who spend all 
their time thinking about this 'thing," 
explains Bobbie Pilette, the head of Yale 
University Library's Preservation Depart-
ment, one week after the testing. "There 
are entire websites devoted to it." 

For Pilette and Yale's other conser-
vation experts, the Voynich testing was 
business as usual, and manuscripts with 
stories beyond and beneath the marks 
of their ink are nothing out of the 
ordinary. The conservation laboratory, 
with windows looking into the atrium-
like Music Library, looks something like 
a high-school art classroom. There is a 
sink in one corner, a fume hood, and long 
yellow fluorescent lights in the ceiling. At 
a worktable covered with white butcher-
paper, Sarah Dove sits with a large and 
apparently blank sheet of something that 
she is gently scraping with a small metal 
tool. Dove is a map specialist, and she is 
removing a damaging adhesive that was 
probably applied sometime in the 1970s. 

"You spend a lot of time looking at the 
reverse sides of things," she explains. 

With the encouragement of her tool, the 
adhesive peels away from the back of the 
map the same way dry Elmer's glue peels 
off of a kindergartener's palm. The other 
side of the sheet is a map of Nova Scotia 
that was once part of George Washington's 
personal map collection. 

To a professional conservator like 
Dove, however, the map is a complicated 
interaction of paper, ink, and time. She 
. . 
sits quite straight, her forearm resting 
on the table, and works with deliberate, 
dispassionate precision. Her focus is not 
on Nova Scotia or George Washington, 
but on removing years of decay, wear, and 
negligence in order to restore the map to 
its original condition. 

In this case, some of the map's 
deterioration was actually caused by now-
February 2009 
outdated preservation techniques. Today, 
most of the processes used to repair books 
can be reversed in case future conservators 
·want to restore the book to its pre-repair 
condition. "Whatever we do could be 
undone without further damaging the 
material," says Pilette. "You don't know 
what future researchers might be looking 
c 
" 
ror. 

For example, if a book's spine is 
damaged beyond repair, Yale's conserva-
tors can attach a new binding to the pages 
of the book with a reversible wheat starch 
adhesive. This means that they could 
easily remove the binding if it became 
damaged again or if a researcher were 
to think it necessary. "You can literally 
brush water on this and it will peel right 
off," says Ian Bogus, holding a half-recon-
structed book. As head of General Collec-
tions Conservation, he is responsible for 
protecting and restoring most of Yale's 
collections. Some have been damaged 
throughstudentabuse, butmosthavesirnply 
deteriorated over time. Besides construct-
ing replacement bindings, Bogus' and his 
assistants' tasks include designing custom 
boxes to house more sensitive books. Each 
box must prevent its contents from warp-
ing or damaging under its own weight, so 
boxes are built to fit books' lengths, widths, 
and heights almost as exactly as the green 
husk of a chestnut encases the fruit itsel£ 

Some books, however, are beyond 
repair. These tomes, having reached the 
end of their lifespans, go down the hall to 
be reincarnated as text divorced from its 
original material self While microfilm-
ing used to be the most common mode 
of reformatting, these days, a book's 
pages are scanned and reprinted on more 
durable paper, or added to a growing digi-
tal database of book images. At his desk, 
surrounded by books with dusty and 
yellowing pages, reformatting special-
ist Gareth Gibson is busy digitizing is-
sues of the Yale Daily News printed dur-
ing the World War IT era. He is ensuring 
that each article electronically links to its 
full continuation, and checking for com-
pleteness 
not even an advertisement will 
be missing from the digital record. He 
once stumbled across a photograph a Yale 
student snapped of the Hindenburg zeppe-
lin as it flew over the University on its way 
to its fateful crash. In general, however, if 
he starts to read whatever he is working 
on, Gibson says, "you just get swamped." 

.. 
Gibson and his colleagues in the 
Preservation Department are technicians 
and scientists, not researchers or histo-
rians. "A book is a mechanical object. 
Whatever you do affects how it will 
operate in the future," Pilette says. There is 
little content that could excite these 
conservators as much a certain antique 
ink · called iron gall. Used widely _·in 
Europe starting in the medieval period, iron 
gall was usually a homemade ink, mixed 
according to family recipes that were 
already centuries old. An individual would 
prepare his or her own ink from wasps' 
nests in oak trees, often distilling the ink 
with wine or beer. As a result, iron gall ink 
is unpredictable, highly acidic, and diffi-
cult for conservators to treat. 

Christine McCarthy, the Yale conser-
vation lab's chief conservator, displays a 
"common-place book" written with iron 
gall and containing disorganized notes and 
records that crowd to the edges of each 
page. The tide on record for this book is 
"Memoranda, historical notes, curiosities, 
and opinions on various subjects." Sadly, 
the author's reddish-brown scrawl has 
begun to bleed through the pages, as the 
acid in his homemade ink dissolves the 
paper on which he wrote. "There is no 
right answer for treating something like 
this," McCarthy says. 

Yet for all their technical expertise, 
good conservators need something more 
than 
chemistry and 
patience. 
Their 
work is "very artistic at times," says E. C. 
Schroeder, who oversees all acquisitions, 
cataloguing, and preservation of ma-
terials at Beinecke Library. "It requires 
hand-eye coordination, good motor skills, 
and a sense of design and · style 
a sense 
of how to preserve the original." The 
conservator must be sensitive to the 
thoughts and intentions of authors long 
dead, who survive only as names on the 
tide-pages of the books they bound, but 
that sensitivity must also be matched 
by 
consideration of researchers 
scholars in centuries to come, who will 
be the ultimate beneficiaries of the 
conservator's work.
