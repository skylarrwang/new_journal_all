As we begin a new year with a new administration, talk of crisis has given way to talk of recovery. New Haven faces unprecedented strains, its longstanding problems worsening even as new ones arise, but it is fielding unprecedented solutions. Building upon the city's tradition of community action, residents are looking beyond government to tackle everything from foreclosure to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. They are turning to each other and reminding us that recovery is more than just fixing what is broken. It is renewing what we have to bolster what we create and remembering where we came from to determine where we were going.

This, our annual theme issue, chronicles a city moving forward a city recovering.
