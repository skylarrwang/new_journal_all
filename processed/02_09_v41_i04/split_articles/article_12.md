and of the Yale Bowl as "where the most 
prominent people would want to be on a 
Saturday afternoon." In those days, Hill 
says, playing football for Yale "was a test 
of manhood in America, and a pretty good 
guarantee of success in life." 

But Yale has changed. With the excep-
tion of 2006, Yale has lost every Harvard-
Yale Game of the new millennium, and 
this is merely the latest slump in a long 
decline. Yale football has been unable to 
compete with the dazzling ascendency 
of the major Division 1 teams since the 
formation of the Ivy League in 1945 and 
its prohibition of athletic scholarships. 
Though Yale fielded a strong team during 
the 1960s, under the leadership of Coach 
Carm Cozza, the team's national stand-
ing and student support have continued 
to fall. For the past two years, Yale's losses 
to Harvard have been particularly brutal: 
10-0 this year, 37-6 the year before. "Last 
year was a disappointment, I think every-
body knows that," says Ryan Fodor SY '09, 
quarterback and graduating captain. "Go-
ing into every season, our goal should be 
to win an Ivy League Championship and 
beat Harvard." 

No one is more eager to make Fodor's 
dream a reality than ex-student athlete, 
former pro-coach, and current Yale foot-
ball messiah Tom Williams, who was ap-
pointed head coach this January. Williams 
is Yale's third head coach in the last 44 
years, and the first African-American to fill 
the position. He replaces Jack Siedlecki, 
who, after a fairly successful twelve-year 
tenure, announced his retirement follow-
ing Yale's shutout loss to Harvard in the 
2008 Game. 

With one infectious grin, Williams can 
fill a room with his enthusiasm for col-
lege football and the coaching profession. 
At a January 29 Master's Tea in Jonathan 
Edwards College, members of the Yale 
community had the chance to see him in 
the flesh. Along with a crush of reporters 
and football fans, I sat chewing cookies as 
Williams, resplendent in a beige suit and 
blue tie, eagerly outlined his vision for 
Yale football. His dapper mustache tilting 
up to the left as he smiled, he emphasized 
his commitment to his players as student 
athletes rather than pawns in an elaborate 
field strategy. 

This focus on students aligns well with 
the ethos of the Ivy League Conference. 
With high academic requirements and 
February 2009 
no athletic scholarships, every football 
program in the Ancient Eight follows the -
same rules of recruiting. Having formerly 
coached at Pacific Ten Conference schools 
Stanford and the University of Washing-
ton, Williams is used to facing teams that 
are either "haves or have nots;" wealthy 
schools like USC, for example, are able to 
attract players with hefty scholarships and 
thus edge out their smaller rivals. The less 
competitive nature of the Ivy League ap-
proach, Williams explained, encourages 
a sense of shared mission, almost of fam-
ily, among Ivy coaches. But to some team 
members, this is part of the problem. 

When a player at the tea asked whether 
Yale stood a chance of gaining more na-
tional recognition, Williams replied, "We 
can win our conference, beat our rival, and 
be as good as we can. We're not going to 
end up in the Championship. That's not 
something we need to be able to do." The 
player nodded, but without enthusiasm. 

The rules of the Ivy League Conference 
necessarily limit the scope of the Yale foot-
ball program, making it almost impossible 
for the team to advance to playoffs. Fodor 
explained that there had been some inter-
est among the players in pushing for a play-
off opportunity, perhaps even a Bowl-style 
standoff. The downside, he said, would be 
diminished support for the Harvard-Yale 
Game, a cornerstone ofYale football tradi-
tion since the days of Walter Camp. And 
Williams, who's placed beating Harvard at 
the top of his list of priorities, would be 
loath to do anything of the sort. Placing 
athletic competition in a larger perspec-
tive, he likened himself to. any other pro-
fessor, albeit one with a "classroom on the 
practice fields." 

Williams had only been on campus for 
a few weeks, but he greeted the players at 
his Master's Tea like old buddies. In the
ante-room, a square-jawed guy in sweats 
transferred a slab of cake to his left hand 
so he and Williams could exchange a bro-
shake. "This is one of those places that 
any college football coach would be inter-
ested in," Williams said. "The prestige, the 
students Yale attracts 
it's a dream come 
true." He wants to ensure that these stu-
dents have a chance to contribute more to 
Yale than their football skills, so in order 
to give his players a chance to be more in-
volved in student life, Williams plans on 
instituting early morning practices. If the 
players hit the field at 5:30 a.m., he rea-
soned, they'll have time to go to Master's 
Teas in the afternoons.
