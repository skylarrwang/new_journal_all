TREASURE UNDERGROUND 
. 
If time travel existed, Jesse Thompson 
and Tony Cwikla would have racked up 
millions of frequent flier years. They're 
history buffs 
guys who'd prefer to throw 
back ale with Benjamin Franklin than 
with high school buddies, who'd rather 
watch gladiator matches with Caesar than 
with Russell Crowe. But since scientists 
have yet to find a traversable wormhole, 
Thompson and Cwikla must recover 
history instead of living it. 

When they aren't working their normal 
jobs (Thompson as switchboard operator 
and Cwikla as factory worker), the two 
men are metal detectorists, or, to put it 
more romantically, treasure hunters. They 
scour beaches, fields, and historic sites for 
coins, jewelry, and other buried relics of 
the past. 

Thompson 
estimates 
that 
there 
are over 3,000 metal detectorists in 
Connecticut, and at least 100,000 across the 
nation. Though some detectorists hunt 
alone, Thompson claims that the most 
serious belong to treasure hunting clubs: 
He presides over the Nor' easters Club 
in Stamford, Cwikla over the Yankee 
Territory Coin Shooters Club in East 
Hartford. 

These 
organizations 
pro-
vide treasure hunters with a network of 
hunting partners and an appreciative audi-
ence for their finds. 

But treasure hunting is not just for 
would-be Indiana Joneses-Cwikla insists 
. that it's an easy hobby to pick up. "Really 
4 
all you need is a detector and something to 
dig with and you're good to go," he says. At 
the East Windsor treasure-hunting store 
he operates when he's not working his 
normal job, Cwikla sells detectors priced 
from $75 
"no more effective than a 
child's toy," he says 
to $1,500. A picture 
on the store's website shows him before 
a row of detectors, his wide grin, glasses, 
and 
bushy salt-and-pepper 
mu~stache 
suggesting a cheerful, avuncular spirit. 

Next to him stands a woman in a tiara and 
bubblegum-pink skirt suit. "Even Ms. 
Connecticut was shopping for a detector," 
the caption reads . 

Not all detectors ·are created equal, 
however. 

As 
he 
explains 
it, 
metal 
detectors are like cars: They have different 
technologies, features, and performance 
characteristics. Good metal detectors such 
as Cwikla's, a White's DFX model valued 
at about $1,200, accurately recognize 
various types of metal and commu-
nicate this information back to the 
hunter through varyingly pitched beeps. 

Lower-quality detectors aren't as discrimi-
nating and might confuse a balled-up 
piece of tin foil with platinum. To avoid 
this irksome situation, Cwikla says, "You 
have to have a good detector. Really 
the only things that matter in treasure-
hunting are your detector, luck, and 
research." 

emphasizes 
this 
last 
variable. "Without research you're not 
going to find much of anything," he says. 
"You have to figure out where the old 
residents were and where people gathered." 

Luckily for the Nor' easters and the 
Yankee Territory Coin Shooters, finding 
historically saturated places in Connecti-
cut is not especially difficult. "Treasure 
hunters in other parts of the country drool 
over Connecticut," Cwikla boasts. "Think 
about it: Connecticut is one of the oldest 
parts of the country, and lots of people 
have lost things over the years. The chanc-
es of finding something old and historical 
here are much better than, say, in the Mid-
west. " 

And at least 
for Thompson and 
Cwikla, happening upon history beats 
striking gold. "While a few detectorists are 
out there looking for the valuable stuff, 
most of us are more interested in history," 

Thompson says in a voice that is husky but 
kind. His club holds their meetings "in the 
catacombs of Saint Maurice Church," a 
testament to its members' devotion to the 
underground past. 

"For 
me," 
continues, 
"metal-
detecting is an escape from the day-to-
day. Every find has a story and trying to 
piece together that story transports you 
to another world. One time, at an apple 
orchard upstate, I found a Spanish real 
from 177 4. Can you imagine? 177 4! 
I remember thinking to myself, 'The 
last person to be holding this coin was 
probably 
someone 
who 
had 
just 
immigrated to America and was having a 
picnic with their family."' 

Cwikla and Thompson have dug 
up everything from watch fobs and 
wedding rings to baseball pendants and 
ornately carved knives. But, like Thompson, 
Cwikla's most cherished find is a.I.so a 
coin 
Roman, from 79 A.D. 

"I was absolutely awestruck when I 
found it," he remembers. "I thought it 
must have been a fake but I took it to an 
appraiser and he authenticated it. How 
it got to Connecticut I have no idea. My 
guess is that some poor kid had a coin col-
lection and dropped it when he brought ir 
in for show and tell." 

But as they say, finders keepers.
