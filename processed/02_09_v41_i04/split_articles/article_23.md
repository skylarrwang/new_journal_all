**Waiting for Obama**
**Author: Mitch Reich**
**Page number(s): 30**

The first time I didn't quite see Obama 
in person, I spent the night alternately 
watching election returns and feverishly. 
vomiting the full contents of my stomach. 
It was there, in the Nashua South High 
School gym, where the then-senator was 
set to give his "Yes We Can" speech after 
he lost the New Hampshire primary, that I 
thought it was all over for both of us. Just 
half an hour before Obama spoke, I finally 
succumbed to the flu and passed out while 
a national campaign staffer standing nearby 
called an ambulance.
'Tm so sorry about this," I said while we 
waited.
"Nonsense," she told me. "There'll be 
plenty of other victory parties to go to." I 
thought she was delusional 
Clinton had 
won and this was the end. We'd have to wait 
a long time to see a party like this again.
I was right about the waiting, at least.
As it turns out, we were the ones we'd been 
waiting in line for. And judging by my trip 
down to the Inauguration, not even in 
lines, but rather in endless, vaguely orient-
ed mobs stretching miles around the Wash-
ington Mall, itself filled with thousands of 
furred and fleeced people and unverifiable 
rumors that there was an entrance in that 
direction or that Obama's motorcade had 
finally left the White House.
We'd been willing to wait patiently even 
30 
though, once we made it inside, there was 
absolutely nothing to do. "I can't see a single 
thing," a woman, her hands m~nernally and 
inexplicably gripping my shoulders, cheer-
fully told me while we were standing on the 
Mall. 'Tll just watch it on TV when I get 
back to the hotel room."
Some of us brave souls waited perched 
atop Port-a-Potties. Others debated wheth-
er Lynne Cheney and Laura Bush were 
truly evil enough to deserve being heck-
led when their faces appeared on the giant 
"jumbotron" screen or if they'd just picked 
the wrong men at the wrong time. One 
high-schooler tirelessly solicited the crowd: 
"Since there's. nothing else to do, let's do the 
Wave!"
Some of us, to be honest, weren't all that 
willing to wait. One of my busmates from 
Yale explained on the ride back to New Ha-
ven that, even though he had a ticket to. the 
Inauguration, to the holy center of the ho-
liest of events, where viewers had a direct 
line of vision to Obama himself, it wasn't 
worth figuring out which of a dozen lines he 
was supposed to stand on in twenty-degree 
weather. "We just watched it from inside an 
Irish pub with a bunch of Hill staffers," he 
said. "They were pretty much on the same 
page as us. We drank Irish car bombs and 
booed when Dick Cheney came on."
Some of us were all too willing to . 
wait. My buddy-for-the-day, Rachel, and 
I walked past a line half a mile long, five 
people wide, snaking .through a tunnel that 
passed under the Mall. We speculated on 
why everyone was so orderly, considering 
that they literally could not see the light at 
the end of the tunnel. "I guess there's a low 
douchiness quotient today," we decided. As 
we later found out, most of these people:-
who had tickets which happened to be la-
beled "purple" 
nearly rioted because they 
never made it out of the infamous Purple 
Tunnel of Doom in time for the ceremony.
But I was the Goldilocks of waiting. I 
waited for the bus to pick us up from New 
Haven at 2 a.m., and for the driver to find 
his way back onto the right highway after 
getting lost somewhere in Maryland. I wait-
ed for Rachel, whom I'd never spoken to 
before, to laugh at a single one of my jokes 
throughout ten hours spent standing in the 
cold. I waited until that guy twenty feet in 
front of me tilted his head the other way so 
I could see the jumbotron while the presi-
dent took the oath. I'd waited a long time 
for this; I could wait a little more.
