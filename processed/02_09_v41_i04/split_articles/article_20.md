well if they're still poor and can't support 
themselves?" 

The VOP's dual approach to recovery 
is non-negotiable, according to Feldman. 
Women may come for group therapy ses-
sions but insist that they don't want to par-
ticipate in the crafts making, or vice-versa, · 
but caseworkers will steer them towards 
both. Even though they have not relapsed 
recently and describe themselves as stable 
and happy, Johnnie-Anne and Comelita 
remain active participants in a variety of 
groups, from the regular morning meet-
ing, at which clients describe their daily 
progress, to the spirituality and Bible-
reading sessions. 


As sucCESSFUL AS the VOP's structure 
tends to be, there are moments when its 
sheer flexibility can prove problematic. 
Women don't need an official referral to 
participate in any of its programs, and 
most come with friends who have told 
them about the organization. 'Ibis infor-
mality makes the VOP uniquely acces-
sible, hut it also means that there are few 
formal mechanisms in place for ensuring 
that clients follow through on their inten-
tions to get well. There are no twelve steps 
here, no regimen of any kind. 

The informality and openness of the 
February 2009 
group sessions also create a complicated 
dynamic between those who are far along 
in the recovery process, those who are just 
beginning, and those who may not have 
come to the VO P to recover at all. Some-
one who has never been addicted to alco-
hol cannot casually sit in on an Alcoholics' 
_ Anonymous meeting, but a female visitor 
who has never suffered from an addiction 
or from poverty or homelessness will be 
welcomed into the VOP community.witb 
extraordinary hospitality simply by virtue 
of being a woman. She may be invited to 
sit in on group sessions without sharing 
anything personal about herself, and she 
can even allow herself to be lulled into feel-
ing a degree of comfort there. But barriers 
inevitably remain. Josephine, friendly and 
blunt as ever, doesn't object to the presence 
of a stranger in most of the sessions she 
leads, but she takes care to remind all who 
are present that the only people who can 
really help each other through addiction 
and destitution are those who have been 
there themselves. 

"We sit in groups with people who have 
no idea what it's like," she says, her voice 
rising as she looks me straight in the eyes. 
"No idea what it's like to have an addic-
tion." In a group discussion on recovery 
skills, a woman flares up at the idea that 
• 
someone could listen to her personal ex-
periences without sharing_ any of her own. 
"I wouldn't have said none of that if I had 
known there was a visitor," she shouts. "It's 
not fair." 

Still, the VOP's flexibility may be its 
greatest asset. Every woman who visits 
chooses consciously to do so. Just walking 
in the door is a deliberate act of empow-
erment. "Today is my perfect example of

turning a negative mto a positive, says 
another woman in Josephine's group, also 
named Mary. She had come in late, and 
explains that after missing an important 
doctor's appointment ea.dkr in the morn-
ing, she thought about gC?ing to drink with 
her cousin afterwards. "But ~nstead, I came 
right here," she says. The group applauds. 
"Ladies, I think we had a pretty good 
group today," Josephine says, jumping out 
of her seat. "If anybody would like to say 
the Serenity Prayer with me, please stand." 
There is a scraping of chairs, and the wom-
en hold hands and recite together: God, 
grant us the serenity to accept the things we 
cannot change, courage to change the things 
we can, and the wisdom to know the differ-
ence. The women applaud again and begin 
to clear food and papers from the table in 
the center of the room. Beads are set out 
in large plastic jars, elastic thread spooled 
onto plastic plates. The women chat as 
they begin to bead, designing necklaces 
and bracelets to sell, keep for themselves, 
or give as gifts to friends and family. The 
craft-making has the feel of an informal 
group session. Someone's daughter is hav-
ing trouble in the foster care system. An-
other is worrying about eviction. A third 
says that her mother is going into surgery 
again. She is silent for a moment. "But," 
she says emphatically, her voice growing 
loud, "nothing is wrong with me!" There is 
laughter, and she continues. ''I'm fine," she 
"I' fin "
