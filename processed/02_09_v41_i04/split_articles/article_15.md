When the term P.T.S.D. was coined in 
198<), it was initially applied only to Viet-
nam veterans. Before that, Vietnam vets 
had noticed common problems 
anxiety, 
bouts of depression, difficulty holding on 
to jobs, a tendency to fidget, trouble trust:_ 
ing others, substance abuse 1 but rarely 
were these cases officially diagnosed or 
linked together, in. part because V.A. hos-
pitals often turned these vets away, but also 
because the vets themselves were reluctant 
to speak out. 
Storm still believes he went to . law 
school as a way to retreat from popular 
antipathy toward Vietnam vets. "Lawyers 
can't be crazy, can they?" he asks. "That 
was gonna be a mask I was gonna use. The 
last thing I wanted anyone to know was 
that I was a vet." 
Storm's multiple decorations within . 
the Marine Corps did not make his home-
coming any easier. For one thing, this was 
the first war from which soldiers were 
shipped home on planes instead of boats, 
truncating their transition from front to 
home front. "One day, I was in the middle 
12 
of a rice paddy, and I'm getting shot at, 
and I'm shooting back, and people are 
screaming and shooting and all kinds of 
terrible things are happening," says Storm. 
"Two days later, I'm sitting in my moth-
er's house, drinking cold milk, thinking, 
'What the heck's going on?"'

But what drove Storm's transitional 
trauma home was the treatment he and 
other Vietnam veterans received once back 
in the States, where he felt that the public 
did not separate the soldier from the un-
popular war, the tool from the wielder of 
power. "Society turned their back on us," 
he says. "People were calling me a baby-
killer. That was forty years ago, but you 
think I'm ever gonna forget that?" 
But in the '80s, he says, as veterans be-
gan to be more accepted within popular 
culture, they began speaking out. "We 
started going to the V.A., and the V.A . 
started sayin', why, there's a lot of people 
here with the same thing. That's when they 
first called it P.T.S.D." 
Since the early 1990s, the- medical 
community has become increasingly re-~ 
sponsive to the psychological and spiritual 
needs of all patients, and particularly vet-
erans. With more and more people return-
ing from Iraq and Mghanistan wounded 
instead of killed, and with the survivability 
rate of the military today higher than it has 
ever been, veterans' need for psychological
