Out of this World 
For his masterwork In a Goldfish Bowl, 
artist Lindbergh van Gogh bought a 
Volkswagen Beetle, removed the roof, 
and filled the interior with water. The 
bold young artist then pushed the vehi-
cle in front of a local newspaper office. 
After painting himself yellow, he sat 
inside, breathing through scuba equip-
ment. 
"What was I saying?" Van Gogh 
said. "We live in a fish bowl, and the 
newspapers look at us." 
Van Gogh is a creation of writer 
Leith Johnson of The Planet, a new 
monthly arts and entertainment 
publication based in Hamden. Like 
van Gogh, The Planet seeks to produce 
artwork that is innovative and ex-
citing, if somewhat bizarre. Unlike the 
newspapers van Gogh portrays, The 
Planet does not follow the people in a 
goldfish bowl. Therefore, 
the 
publication's motto is 
"No news is 
good news."· 
The 
Planet 
was 
founded 
last 
November by a group of graphic 
designers and artists who had recently 
graduated from the University of Con-
necticut. "We got good jobs, and we 
liked what we were doing, but we 
wanted to do something a little bit 
crazy," said Gunnar Johnson, the 
newspaper's editor and 
publisher. 
When he produced his first issue this 
past June, Johnson hoped The Planet 
would become "a vehicle for all the 
starving artists in 
New Haven." 
Because it received little reaction from 
potential writers and artists, however, 
the publication evolved over its next 
three issues into an entertainment 
newspaper featuring the writing and 
artwork of its 10-member staff. Each 
issue centers on a theme, such as July's 
"Vacation" or September's "Back to 
School." J ohnson now 
distributes 
2,500 
free 
copies of each 
issue 
throughout the New Haven area. 
Stories in The Planet range from the 
light and humorous to the profoundly 
strange. In the "Vacation" issue, writer 
William Below offered "Dr. Bill's Vaca-
tion Theory" as advice to the typical 
American traveler. "Surely," he wrote, 
"if the United States is the petri dish of

Greene was able to incorporate many 
of his ideas into the scripts. As a result, 
his role was transformed into a more 
dynamic one. 
"1 found myself talking more about 
what I wanted to say. But in the end, it 
was my image that was really im-
portant. My character was never 
meant to be 'a real person'." 
Greene has made a transition into a 
different kind of performance. "I am 
still performing," he explained, "but I 
am doing it in a way that allows me to 
incorporate my own ideas."

teaching, legal practice, and writing. It

Greene was eventually able to portray 
a "much Inore balanced, fair, and 
healthy 
character." Unfortunately, 
Greene finds that the entertainment in-
dustry 
still portrays many black 
characters as discouragingly litnited. 
Greene has discovered that many pro-
ducers of movies and theater, lured by 
potential financial rewards, frequently 
choose to project "negative· images of 
Third World peoples." Greene has even 
producers create roles for which 
black actors simply cannot audition. 
A 
legal · educanon, 
Greene 
ex-
plained, will empower him with the 
skills necessary to defend his rights as a 
performer. "I never want to have to 
shriek and stick my head under a 
pillow when somebody says 'sl,le me.'" 
With an intimate knowledge of the 
law, Greene feels he will be able to pur-
sue his media career without submit-
ting to the discriminatory policies of 
the entertainment industry. 


The realities of embarking on a 
in the performing arts constitute 
the main theme of Greene's seminar at 
Yale. He hopes to examine with his 
students the ethical choices artists are 
sometimes forced to make when a pro-
ducer's racial, 
political, · or sexual 
beliefs are dissonant with those of the 
artist. He intends to discuss the confu-
sion a performer may experience when 
tempted by the chance of money or 
prestige 
to 
accept work 
in 
a 
psychologically damaging situation. 
Greene aspires to · instill in his students 
an uncompromising sense of artistic 
and ethical integrity, a firm base from 
which they can begin to explore their 
professional lives. 


After law school, Greene hopes to 
become a movie producer eventually 
and to continue distinguishing himself 
as an artist who will not allow profit-
inducements to threaten his 
~ntal beliefs. He concluded 
thoughtfully, "I want to stay in touch 
with the social and political values I've. 
had my whole adult life." _ 



**Lisa in the Sound: no schools, just squid**

Lisa in the Sound: no schools, just squid 
Whale's Tale 
Welcomed by a string of expletives 
from Yale medical student David 
Cromwell and by the frantic screams of 
his_ sailing pat:tner, a 
13-foot-long 
Beluga whale em!::rged late last July in 
the Long Island Sound, just ofi the . 
coast of New Haven. Barely missing the 
starboard side of their Laser sailboat 
and soaking the two with her spray, the 
pearly white whale followed them for 
the next 500 yards as they tried to 
escape. 


Cromwell quickly realized, 
however, that trying to outmaneuver 
the whale was unwise and, as the whale 
became 
rnor.e playful, unnecessary. 
N ow , two months later, the whale still 
swims along the Connecticut coastline 
appearing anywhere between Darien 
and N ew H aven on a given day. The 
creature, named Lisa for the Long 
Island Sound America organization, is 
as harmless as the small fish on which 
she has fed in the New Haven harbor 
for the past seven months. Photographs 
of Lisa 
swimming alongside small 
children prove her gentleness. But her 
unique situation, living without other 
whales and surrounded by humans, 
could threaten her survival. 


]}ecause whales usually travel in 
schools, observers at the Long Island 
Sound Task Force worried at first that 
Lisa was sick or injured. But apparent-
ly 
Lisa has returned, if only by 
herself, to a familiar region. The 
Sound, which includes New Haven 
harbor , had been home to large 
schools of Belugas. The increasing 
temperature and pollution content of 
the water, however, drove them away 
to fresher waters, particularly the St. 
Lawrence Strait. As their new homes 
became over-populated, many whales 
were forced to leave. According to 
marine biologists, the high squid con-
tent of the Sound probably attracted 
Lisa to this area over others. 


Lisa's continued solitude and emo-
tion~] state, though, remain a mystery. 
"We can't really say if she's lonely, but 
she's normal," said marine biologist 
David Merritt from 
Connecticut's 
Mystic Seaport. "And since she's acting 
normally, chances are she's happy." . 


Only boats and the people in them 
threaten Lisa. 
"People might be 
unaware of her existence and harm her 
out of fright, or some real macho sailor 
could try to harpoon her to ·show his 
friends," Merritt explained. 


While 
concerned about Lisa, Merritt is quick 
to deny that abrasions seen on Lisa's 
skin were caused by the old entertain-
ment, now illegal, of hooking large fish 
to tnotorboat lines and dragging them 
for miles. Abrasions like Lisa's mark 
all Belugas' soft skin from contact with 
the ocean's rough surfaces. Merritt 
continued that, contrary · to current 
rumor, Mystic Seaport has no inten-
tion of taking Lisa in since she is too 
old to accept a life of relative confine-
ment. 


Left alone, Lisa should remain in 
good health. Each day in the Sound 
further enables her to survive there. 
"It's like an abandoned dog who }:ta~ t_o 
get 'street smart' to live," Merritt said. 
Because of Lisa's ready adaption, and 
because she has not been plagued with 
any of the possible dangers, t1'!e &_o_und 
once again houses majestic wildlife-
even if only a lone whale. 


**Speaking in Tongues**

Speaking in Tongues 
"Welcome-Bienvenidos" reads the sign 
in the foyer of New Haven's Hill Cen-
tral School K-5. Like many schools in 
the United Stat~s. Hill Central, with 
its large Spanish-speaking population, 
greatly needs a comprehensive bi-

lingual education program. Yet the, 
future of bilingual education may be 
threatened by the Reagan Administra· 
tion's new policies. 


Speaking on September 26 about 
bilingual education, Education 
Secretary William Bennett declared 
that the programs ha.ve failed to bring 
pupils into 
the English-speaking 
mainstream. 
The New 
York 
Times 
quoted him as saying, "After $1.7' 
billion of federal funds we have no 
evidence that children we sought to 
, help- that the children who deserve 
our help-have benefiteCl.". His opin· 
ion is supported by the negative results 
of many studies conducted on bilingual 
education in recent years. 


These 
showed that English isn't being taught 
quickly enough and that valuable time 
is being lost in regular classroom in· ·
struction. 


Despite past findings, however, new 
research by Yale psycholinguist Dr. 
Kenji Hakuta refutes Bennett'sclaims. 
According to Hakuta, children in bi- 
lingual programs not only keep up 
with their English-speaking peers, bu 
may in fact excel them in some areas. 
"Children who 
have 
developed 
strong skills in their native languag~ 
will transfer these abilities to English,: 
Hakuta said, disputing the "lost-time 
argument. Children taught in a bi- 
lingual setting also develop a greate~ 
understanding of the mechanics an~ 
structure of language. Furthermore, 
Hakuta has found that a bilingual child 
displays superior cognitive abilities in 
reading skills and non-verbal logic. 


His findings also undermine 
th~ 
main tenets of an approach to bilingu~ 
education known as the "immersion 
technique, 
in which non-English 
speaking students are immediately 
placed in an all-English classroom. Io 
the past, advocates of immersion have 
argued that it is the most successful 
and least expensive of bilingual tech- 
niques. But. the most common ap-
proach has been the "transitional" pro-
gram, in which students keep up with 
the reading, math, and other subject! 
in their native tongues, while learning 
enough English to enter the regul~ 
classroom. The transitional program 1! 
successful enough that students whO 
enter the program in kindergarten 
usually will be transferred to the 


regular classroom within two years. 
Yet many evaluations of the tran· 
'i!jonal method are conducted in the 
fourth grade, on those children who 
never left the program and are still 
learning in two languages. Critics 
point to the remaining fourth graders 
aa a sign of bilingual education's 
failure, when, in fact, they are most 
likely to be slow learners in any 
language. 


Hakuta suggests an alternative to 
both these programs and is working for 
ita implementation in New Haven 
schools like Hill Central. In what is 
called the "two-way" program, the 
clauroom consists of half native-
speakers and half English-speakers. All 
children begin learning in Spanish and 
are later introduced to English. T he 
-~panish-speaker . benefits from a bi-
hngual program, and the English 
speaking child is exposed to a second 


Yet because of Washington's new 
position, such federally-funded pilot 
Programs may have trouble procuring 
funds. Bennett has called for the 
d~~gulation of bilingual education, 
gavang local 
school districts the 
autonomy to determine how the pro-
~~ are run. Many advocates of 
bahng u a l education feel that 
Washington is trying to saddle the 
states and cities with a responsibility 
that locals themselves do not want. 


This year, the government funded 
only two cities for the two-way pro-
gt'aln, and New 'Haven was fourth on 
the .list. Perhaps New Haven will 
~ve the necessary funds to initiate 
dou
e program next year. But Hakuta is 
btful. "If New Haven doesn't 
receive funds from the feds, I believe 
we will take a grass roots approach and 
801Dehow fund it on a local level. 
Hawever, without the federal govern-
ment's support for new and innovative 
f i'Ograms such as the two-way one, a 
tt of locaJ authorities will shy away 
rom them. I believe that Washington's 
~are 
just a smokescreen for term-
l~g minority programs, which are 
t orna
1. 
in the side of conservative 
po atica."

Between the Vines/ Joe Levy 
Windows on the World 
The electronics department at Macy's 
has 73 TV sets. I counted them while 
shopping for towels across the aisle in 
the bath shop. Glancing up from a pile 
of blue Martex washcloths, I was 
suddenly confronted by a presidential 
news conference and 73 
smiling 
Ronald Reagans making short state-
ments about apartheid. I watched it for 
a little while; I like to watch things on 
TV. 

But 
no love for television, 
however great or small, could have 
prepared me 
for a spectacle this 
confounding and bizarre. There on the 
third floor of Macy's, next door to the 
bedding and shower curtains, just 
steps away from the cookware and 
coffee pots, the miracle of living color 
had swept me away to a land of live-
broadcast special reports. Imagine a 
world with 73 Ronald Reagans. I was 
living in it. 

If only it had been Wheel of Fortune 
splashed across those 73 screens, then I 
could have comforted myself with 
some Baudelairean mutterings about 
the perception of beauty in sleaze and 
grotesquerie. No go. There was no 
game show host, no smiling Pat Sajack 
or his lovely assistant Vana White to 
help me out of this one. This was me 
and the medium in a no-holds-barred, 
steel-cage grudge match in the middle 
of Macy's, and boy was I scared. 

From the bath shop I could just 
barely make out the President's words, 
but his image was clear, warm, and 
echoed across the TV screens. This 
mass dosage of mass culture produced 
a panic in me that I hadn't known since 
last November. Back then I was sure, 
popular opinion be damned, that the 
entire election had been decided by 
those TV ads that packaged America 
as a sunny place where folks smile, 
barbecue chicken, and raise flags. "It's 
morning in America. Ron is it: the 
most refreshing face around. Have a 
I 0 The New Journal/October II. 1985 
President and a smile." Now, 10 
months later, I was in Macy's watching 
73 Ronald Reagans and thinking how 
much the commander-in-chief of the 
ship of state reminded me of the 
Skipper on Gilligan's Island. Maybe it 
was those rosy cheeks, all 146 of them, 
that made me expect the President to 
pull out a sailor's cap and playfully 
whack P. W. Both a over the head. 
"Come on little buddy, cut it out!" 
Smiles, laughs, and the frame freezes 
on a grinning state department while 
the theme music comes up and the 
credits roll. The apartheid problem 
ends in time for the 12:30 p.m. 
commercial break. 

My friends at Yale are disapproving 
of my TV habit. 

My 
tales of 
uncovering television treasures, both 
trashy and true, are greeted by 
uncomfortable pauses. "Gee . . . you 
sure watch a lot of TV." People just 
don't seem to understand that it's a thin 
line between love and hate. "Do you 
really love TV?" my roommate Ben 
asked incredulously, his eyes searching 
mine for some glint of hipper-than-the-
masses irony. "There's no way I can 
condone that," he said, shaking his 
head. Neither can I really. Those 
uncomfortable pauses and incredulous 
stares from my friends make me feel as 
though I'm an intellectual suspect. 

They cow me into 
masking my 
enjoyment of television behind theories 
and 
analysis. Through 
mystical 
incantations known only 
to the 
academic elite, I turn the boob tube 
into a window through which I glimpse 
the mood, likes, and trends of some 
America of which I'm not really a part. 

The problem with this sort of analysis 
is it denies that TV reveals something 
about me and why I want my MTV, or 
MTM, or Miami Vice, or whatever. 

It's not just intellectual snobbery 
that makes me uncomfortable with my 
own TV habit. I've seen television 
stripped 
of 
any 
enjoyable 
entertainment value and reduced to 
the beguiling, hypnotic monster so 
many believe it to be. And I've seen all 
this multiplied 73 times over on the 
third floor of Macy's. Yow. 

But it doesn't take a genius to realize 
that TV can be God-awful sometimes. 
Geniuses realize that TV is really a 
capi talist 
tool or some self-
pel petuating brain cancer spawned 
from the murky depths of the junk 
culture itself. They never seem to 
acknowledge that 
people 
watch 
television because it fills a need in their 
lives. It is an honest human need that 
in some way relates to the desire to tell 
and hear stories, a need that has 
followed man from The Odyssey to 
Dynasty. In high school English we 
accepted the seductive but unrealistic 
visions of happy lands, where the 
course of true love is always ultimately 
a success, by practicing a "suspension 
of disbelief." But now we critique the 
seductive but unrealistic visions of 
television with the phrase "mass 
cuJture as mass deception." If there's 
any injustice here it's not in thinking 
that Shakespeare's plays are a better art 
form than situation comedies, but it's 
in assuming that most of America 
doesn't know that already. 

"If you can't drink until you're 21," a 
friend of mine once said, "then I think

Bridging the Gap?

Not since last fall had students seen 
workers gathered on High Street. Yet 
on September 11, 1985, 40 people, 
mostly 
women , 
mostly Sterling 
Library workers, all Local 34 members 
and sympathizers came together for a 
lunchtime rally on the walkway in 
front of Sterling. Black ribbons and 
Union buttons displayed on breast 
pockets distinguished the ralliers from 
passers-by and curious bystanders. 

Quickly, light conversations dissipated 
as enthusiastic but often hostile cheer-
ing began. Reaching into brown paper 
bags for sandwiches, 
protestors 
listened while several of their co-
workers spoke about personal 
grievances with library management. 
12 The New Journaii<Xtobt-r II, 198!:1 
For such 
a 
small 
crowd,the 
at-
mosphere 
was unusually volatile. 

Pauses from the speaker often brought 
wild clapping and shouts from the 
periphery about "the library regime." 
"They don't treat us like humans!" 
someone yelled. "We have to protect 
the precious few freedoms we still 
have." Half an hour later lunch was 
over, and the workers began filing 
back into the library. 

A year ago union rallies were a 
familiar sight at Yale. After Local 34's 
emotionally charged and divisive 
14-week strike, the Union and the 
University apparently bridged their 
differences last January by signing a 
new contract. But now, nine months 
later, "harrassment" and "unfair treat· 
ment" are accusations that the Univer· 
sity's clerical and technical (C&T) 
workers aim at management and, oc· 
casionally, at each other. As workers 
and management try to build an eiTec· 
tive relationship based on the new con· 
tract, many find that the whole ex· 
perience of the strike has failed to in· 
crease mutual understanding and 
respect. Instead, resentment from the 
strike persists, infecting each side's in· 
terpretation of the contract. Conse· 
quently the familiar scenarios of Union 
protest and administrative reticence 
have surfaced once more. 

Both the Union and the University 
seem pleased with the contract, which

now disciplines them for minor infrac-
tiolll aa part of a broader effort to rid 
Yale of the Union. To challenge this at-
tempt, 
Local 34 has 
initiated a 
grievance-filing campaign. The Union 
encourages workers to contest unwar-
ranted disciplinary measures by 
~nting cases before their super-
~n. If a case is denied at this stage, 
It can be presented before a represen-
tative at Human Resources (Person-
nel), and if denied there, the Union 
BOel 
to the Director of Human 
Retources. There are no expenses for 
~ 
first three steps. But if the case 
faila again and the Union feels that its 
contention is strong, it can bring the 
matter before the American Arbitra-
l~ Board, a body comprised of un-
biQed labor lawyers. The party that 
Io.ea the arbitration case must pay all 
Qpenaes. 

The Union's grievance-filing cam-
~111 has taken hold in Sterling 
&..IOrary, where C&Ts have fiJed 20 
P'ievances since the strike's end, 14 of 
which were settled at the second step 
and aix at the third. "There's a lot of

whenever she can find a spare mo-
ment. Serving on the Local 34 ex-
ecutive board and as a union steward 
in the ijbrary, she has represented both 
herself and other workers during 
grievance procedures. 

Gergen, who has received several 
oral and written disciplinary notices 
from her supervisor, is oangry. Her 
boss recently reprimanded her for 
speaking with a 
co-worker about 
union business after lunch. "Had I 
gone up there to ask him for his recipe 
for Brunswick stew and stayed for 20 
minutes, no one would have cared. 
Just the fact tbat 'it was union business 
gets me a disciplinary letter m my file." 
The letter, Gergen believes, is the first 
step in finding cause to fire her. She 
describes post-strike Sterling as closely 
resembling 
a 
14th-century feudal 
manor. Tales abound of supervisors 
following employees to the bathroom 
during working hours and eavesdrop-
ping on their conversations, hoping to 
catch them discussing Union matters 
on the job. Gergen feels that manage-
ment is constantly watching her. She 
cannot even make short phone calls to 
other i.lnio'n members to set lunch 
dates without fearing that "higher-ups" 
will discover the transgression and 
discipline her. 

"What I see is union leaders trying to 
turn their university jobs into full-time 
union activities," said Peter Vallone, 
vice-president of human resources. 
"Consequently, we have to remind 
these employees that they still work for 
Yale." Casually leaning back in his ex-
ecutive swivel armchair, Vallone con-
tinued to speak acros s the length of a 
conference table. "We ha' ~ employees 
active in the Union who do have prob-
lems because they think they can go 
wherever they want, when they want. 
We don't agree with their attitude-
'Hey, we can't be touched because 
w,.!re in the Union. · 
Vallone 01rected personnel for the Il-
linois government before joining the 
Yale administrative staff four months 
ago. With a considerable amount of 
negotiating experience behind him but 
never a strike, Vallone was attracted 
by Yale's dubious distinction of having 
weathered five strikes in 15 years. He 
felt that he could offer Yale a new 
perspective on labor relations. Now, 
however, 
Vallone questions the 
perception 
that tensions 
between 
Local 34 and the Yale administration 
are increasing again. In an article from 
the September 11 , 1985 issue of The 
N~ Havm Register, Vallone went so far 
as to report that there is "extremely 
high morale" at Sterling Library. 

Vallone's reasons for optimistic 
public statements elude most Union 
act1v1sts. 
Many are suspicious of 
management's stringent emphasis on 
rules and regulations, a move that has 
effectively deprived 
some library 
C&Ts of past autonomy. For instance, 
there is the currently disputed issue of 
flextime. In Sterling, which employs 
more C&Ts than any other building on 
campus, the methods of administration 
before the strike wer<: very irregular. 
Sterling was, and still is to some ex-
tent, a kingdom with fiefdoms in every 
nook and cranny. Flextime, a program 
initiated in the seventies, permitted 
employees to work overtime when 
their services were most in demand 
without extra pay. Instead of the extra 
pay, workers were allowed to accum-
ulate hours for future time off during 
slow months. Under the new contract, 
the University is legally bound to pay 
time-and-a-half to any employee who 
works beyond 37.5 hours in a week, 
regardless of the worker's wish to 
forego extra pay in lieu of future time 
off. 

The University, however, is reluc-
tant to pay overtime. Therefore, 
workers who stay late must seek the ap-
proval from their supervisor. Gergen, 
who was recently reprimanded for 
staying at work 15 minutes past her 
shift, believes that these new rules have 
appeared because the library manage-
ment, 
threatened by 
the UnioJ?'S 
strength, is clinging desperately to its 
power. "All of these new rules and . 
regulations have nothing to do with 
getting the work done, but everything 
to do with teaching us our places and 
keeping us in line." she said. "I don't 
have to be shown who's boss in here. 
But I don't want to be treated as 
anything less 
than a 
responsible 
human being." 

Not far from Gergen's post in the

;Microtext room, at the opposite end of 
the same dark hallway, is the office of 
the opposition, Deputy University 
Librarian Jack Siggins. His wife and 
Director of Library Personnel, 
Maur:een Sullivan, sits with Siggins in 
his 
well-lit and spacious 
office 
overlooking the courtyard. The mood 
in the room is calm, rational and even 
understanding. 

Although Unionists 
might describe the pair as tyrants, they 
keep such characteristics well hidden. 
During the Sterling demonstration on 
June 12, Sullivan received a hand-
delivered letter of protest as w.orkers 
marched through the libra.ry with 
union cards held high above their 
heads. But Sullivan had expected ten-
sions to arise during the re-entry 
period 
after the striking workers 
returned to the library last December. 
"I anticipated worse problems than we 
have had," she said. "Most people 
returned with the mind to re-establish 
working relationships. They came 
back to do their jobs." 

Both administrators claim that by 
adhering to the rules and regulations 
outlined in the new contract, they have 
been able to encourage good relations 
between workers and management. 
"We're trying to implement a contract, 
and it's causing us to examine our ap-
proach, which needs to be fair and con-
sistent throughout the library," 
Sullivan said. "It's true, we are cen-
tralizing." 

Ironically, as the case of flextime 
demonstrates, 
the new contract's 
specificity has led some union mem-
bers to the conclusion that the manage-
ment, out of vindiction, is tightening 
its grip on the library staff. Neither 
Sullivan nor Siggins believes in the 
validity of the Union's accusations of 
harrassment. Many of the conflicts, ac-
cording to Sullivan, stem from per-
sonal matters. She feels that blaming 
them on library supervisors or on Yale 
administrators "is just finding a con-
venient 
scapegoat." 
Siggins sup-
ported her statement, "There are just 
some people who don't accept the con-
tract for what it is. Their view is. '\'\'hat 
I have is mine and what you have, we'll 
.share." But things will change," he 
added wi•h a chuckle. "It just takes 
time." 

Yale hired Siggins and many other

· who had already opted not to join. One 
. day a union steward from her depart-
. ment approached the manager to ask if 
he could hold a lunch meeting with 
several other stewards in one of the 
available 
rooms. 
The supervisor 
agreed and suggested the staff room. 
Stevens 
and several other non-
members objected, asking that the 
·supervisor tell the stewards to meet in 
an adjacent room. The stewards re-
fused, stating that their meeting was 
open and anyone could listen to it. To 
Stevens, however, that was just the 
point. She and her co-workers did not 
want to hear the Union's business over 
lunch. According to her, the manager 
would not push the issue any further. 
"Managers are too reluctant to stand 
up for the rights of their non- union 
workers for fear of being burned by 
grievances," she 
explained. "The 
management goes by the rules so much 
that it fails to reach out to us." 

Indeed, 
those 
who 
must ad-
ministrate both union and non-union 
workers become entangled in the con-
flicts between the two groups and in 
the end are scorned by both. Managers 
walk a very thin line. Union activists 
charge that managetnent singles them 
out for discipline while courting the 
non-members. And such accusations 
are countered by many non-Unionists, 
like Stevens, who . assert that super-
visors bend so far over backward to 
avoid conflict with union workers that 
they neglect those employees who kept 
the University running during the 
strike, for whose work the tnanagers 
received credit. "We feel we deserve at 
least a pat on the back or sotnething. 
Free coffee and doughnuts doesn't 
amount to much," she said, referring 
to a gathering held in Sterling during 
• 
~ "If people called you 
i" names on the street, 
2 are you supposed to 
forget that?" 
... 
~ the 
conflict 
for 
the non-striking 
0 workers. "The University's ·continued 
negligence only adds insult to injury." 

All three- union members, non-
members, and management 
_do agree 
on one matter: that life would be much 
simpler if the University could bargain 
with a workforce that was either entire-
ly unionized, or not at all. A~ it stands, 
the bargaining unit, Local 34, is 
employed as an agency shop, as op-
posed to an open or closed shop. This 
· means that the Union is bound by 
federal law to represent all C&Ts at 
Yale, whether or not they actually 
belong to the organization. As a result, 
C&Ts who went on strike feel used by 
those who, although they crossed 
picketlines, still benefit from the hard-
won contract. 

However, at Union headquarters 
on 88 Prospect Street, officials speak of 
forgiveness and unity. "While it isn't 
easy to bury the hatchet when it's been 
in your back for so long, it would be 
good to have them in the Union. Good 
for us and good for them," said 
Michael Boyle '79, 
one 
.. of 
the 
six paid union officials. On the second 
floor, next to the headquarters of Local 
35, Boyle shares office space with at 
least three other union official~ who are 
constantly walking in and out or con-
ducting u-nion business by phone. If 
the intensity in this office is any indica-
tion, there has been little slo~down of 
union activity since the strike's end. 
Boyle's desk, like all of those around 
him, is piled high with pamphlets and 
papers which he shuffles through 
periodically to search for documents. 
After graduating from Pierson ·Col-
lege, Boyle worked in the Yale Univer-
sity printing service where he voted 
against Local 34 to serve as the C&T 
bargaining unit in 198~. 
But 
with 
the onset of the strike, he changed his 
mind and delved into union activity, 
eventually working on the negotiating 
committee during the strike. 

Today, Boyle hopes to recruit more 
members to the Union and to inform 
all workers of their contractual rights. 
He says the Union will try to place at 
least one steward in every department 
on campus. Consequently, if an unin-
formed employee's rights are violated, 
he or she will have quick access to 
union aid. "We want people to know

Talk of foi'Jivenell and unity at 88 Protrpec:t Street, Union Headquarters 
"The strike created hard feelings that have never been resolved." 
we aren't just in the office on Prospect 
Street, but in their labs as well." But 
Boyle does not acknowledge the strong 
convictions some people have against 
unions. He believes that non-union 
members are "fairly sympathetic, but 
have a laissez-faire view or are afraid 
of their bosses; it may be that this is 
their first job back in the workforce 
after having a child or that their 
husbands are against unions." 
Because Local 34 does represent all 
C&Ts, costs to print up contracts for 
non-members and to represent non-
members in grievance cases must be 
financed. The contract stipulates that 
all non-union workers hired before 
April 4, 1984 pay dues into the Con-
tract Administration Fund, and those 
hired thereafter pay directly to the 
Union. The fund is to be administered 
by one union official, one university 
official and a third selected by the first 
two. While required to relinquish por-
tions of their monthly salary, non-
union members have no voice in 
determining where their money goes. 
Many of them are irate that their par-
ticipation was never solicited, even as 
ex officio members on a board. Con-
currently, union officials like Gergen 
can't believe that non-members care so 
little about their money that they 
wouldn't consider joining the Union in 
order to control what happens to it. 
But Boyle has faith the Union will 
break through to the non-members 
once they discover that the University 
will "treat 
them 
in 
the same 
dehumanizing way as they treat the 
rest of us." 
From the union member's point of 
view, this potential for harassment, 
.nore than financial issues, is the most 
compelling reason for current non-
union members and new employees to 
join. Involved with Local 34 from its 
inception, Sammy Carr, a C&T at the 
M edical School currently working in 
the Office for Women in Medicine, 
believes that the risk of harassment on 
the j ob is too high not to have union 
support. "When people were first talk-
ing about a union, the situation with 
my boss was very good," she said. "But 
I had seen so many bad things around 
m e that I had to support the idea of a 
union. You just can't tell when things 
might go b~d." 
Lowering her voice, Carr began her 
own story. She explained that relations 
with her boss, a doctor, remained good 
until the strike began. O nce she was 
out on the picket line, however, all 
changed. "I would call him, and he 
would say how concerned he was," 
Carr explained, "But not once would 
that man come out simply to have a 
cup of coffee and talk." When Carr 
returned to work, she claims that her 
boss and the business manager tried "to 
make life hell." One day her boss 
presented three serious accusations 
against her in front of the business 
manager, the assistant manager, a co-
worker, and a paid union represen-
tative. Of the. three accusations, the 
most extreme a-nd, Perhaps the most 
absurd, was that Carr had been 
responsible for, in her words, "killing 
nine babies." 
Well, Carr did not kill any babies. 
Nine women, however, were placed on 
a list as having positive results from 
pregnancy tests when, actually, their 
results had been negative. The mistake


--- Page 17 ---

occurred when Carr was reading 
results over the phone to an employee 
at the Women's Center, and the word 
•negative" was never heard. Only three 
of the nine women were actually given 
incorrect results before the error was 
caught, yet Carr's boss considered the 
matter serious enough to warrant 
discipline and possible dismissal. Carr 
filed a grievance challenging these ac-
cusations but said that the matter was 
dropped when she began pressuring 
her boss to present his case in a 
meeting with a union steward. Since 
then Carr has transferred depart-
ments, happy now with her new job 
and working environment. 
Although Carr admits that her case 
is unusual, she adamantly defends the 
need for a strong union as a protector 
of all Yale '. C&Ts. Recent demonstra-
tions, rallies, and a large membership 
meeting in BatteU Chapel are part of a 
campaign to increase Local 34's 
visibility and viability. But if the 
Union is to function as the legitimate 
voice for the C&T workforce, it must 
first win the confidence and en-
thusiasm of the large body of non-
members before successfully challeng-
ing the University on issues like 
harassment and respect. Yet with or 
without total support, Local 34 never-
theless will continue to dispute the 
University concerning grievance_s, 
both personaJ and general. T he con-
tract has done little to convince the 
Union of any good intentions on the 
University's part. The administration, 
however, believes the contract will 
eventually cure all, making subsequent 
Union demands and complaints in-
valid. The contract, of course, could 
not have been expected to erase 
memory nor defuse the inherent con-
flicts between labor and management. 
T he disagreements between Local 34 
and Yale, and among the C&Ts 
themselves, neither began nor ended 
last winter. Perhaps the three-month-
long strike was just the prelude.

Revolutionary Gospel 
Pam Thompson 
August 27, 1985, 1:30 p.m., Cape 
Town, 
South Africa. 
Dr. 
Allan 
Boesak, president of the World Coun-
cil of Reformed Churches and a 
founder of the United Democratic 
Front (UDF) was "detained" today by 
the South African police under the In-
ternal Security Act. This act allows 
anyone to be detained by order of any 
senior police officer and held in-
definitely without warrant and bail. At 
a church meeting earlier this morning, 
Boesak received notice of student and 
police clashes at the University of 
Western Cape, where he is chaplain. 
He decided to go to the university to 
try to calm the students. On his way, 
Boesak was stopped by police at a 
roadblock. Three minutes later, two 
plainclothes policemen took Allan 
Boesak away. 
Just a 
week before this arrest, 
Boesak had issued a statement in 
response to allegations by Louis le 
Grange, the minister of Law and 
Order, that he was using his clerical 
robe as "battle dres~": "The minister 
18 The New J ournaVOctober II, 1985 
must not impose his violent , 
militaristic thinking upon me. I have 
marched in the face of his armed 
police, not with guns ... but with my 
Bible-my faith in Jesus Christ and 
my people's determination to be free. I 
will do so again. . . . My resistance to 
apartheid is based upon my calling and 
faith as a Christian. No powers on 
earth, including the awesome powers 
at the minister's disposal, will stop me 
from doing my duty." 
In the Cape province of South Africa, 
Allan Boesak was born a "coloured," a 
person of mixed race. He grew up in a 
very poor family, his mother caring for 
him and his six brothers and sisters 
after the death of their father. When he 
decided to become a min.ister, he was 
given his theological education by the 
"coloured" part of the Dutch Reformed 
Church. After receiving his doctorate 
in theology in The Netherlands, he 
came back to South Africa amidst the 
unrest of the late seventies. He became 
a world-respected theologian; as Presi-
dent of the World Council of Re-
formed Churches, he represents 17 
million Christians world wide. 
Even 
Yale recognized Boesak's achievements 
by awarding him an honorary Doctor 
of Divinity degree in 1984. 
Despite his degrees and his posi-
tions, Boesak's theology is one that 
challenges, rather than affirms the ex-
isting power structures of the world. 
His radical theology of liberation sees 
no separation between religion and the 
political, revolutionary struggle for 
justice in the world. For that reason, 
Boesak helped found the UDF, an 
anti-apartheid, 
non-racial umbrella 
organization composed of various 
church groups, labor unions and stu-
dent organizations. His life, he says, 
"is in the hands of God," to be used for 
the struggle against apartheid in South 
Africa. 
For me, that newspaper article an-
nouncing Boesak's arrest violated the 
safe boundaries of newsprint, the 
boundaries with ourselves on one side, 
the people in the news on the other. 



**Title: How Long?**
**Author: Not specified**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
"How long, how long, 
does it take for people 
to begin to 
understand?" 
This time, the story wasn't about a 
stranger. A month before his arrest, I 
had met Boesak at a theology con-
ference in Stony Point, a small town in 
upstate New York. 
Although the 
newspapers later called him the "fiery 
anti-apartheid leader," the small, trim 
man 
with 
wire-rimmed 
glasses 
who appeared at the conference wear-
ing a conservative gray pin-striped suit 
could not have been less threatening. 
The man who a 
South African 
newspaper had referred to as the "most 
dangerous man in South Africa" sat 
waiting to speak, looking down at his 
hands, a little startled and embarrassed 
when someone introduced him as a 
man who has "taken a role in history." 
He spoke with a soft, lilting voice that 
becomes high-pitched when moved or 
trying to move others. 
"And when I come to the United 
States, and I say, yes- I believe in 
non-violence, they give me standing 
ovations, but what in God's name does 
it help us?" Boesak asked. "I am a little 
upset today, because I have heard, just 
before I started to speak, that once 
again ... two people have been killed, 
and one of them a 12-year-old boy. 
How long, how long does it take for 
J>eople to begin to understand?" . 
He looked around the room, at 
everyone who'd been watching him so 
intently, breathing with the cadence of 
his words. He waited, letting the un-
comfortable silence hang in the air for 
a moment. Then he continued, look-
ing at each of us. "I just get so angry at 
people who are so glib about violence 
and non-violence; I get so angry at 
people who are self-righteous about 
that issue; I get so angry at people who 
have the instruments of non-violent 
pressure that could end the violence at 
their disposal and they refuse to use 
them." 

Accustomed to the rights to speak 
freely and 
protest 
peaceably, 
Americans forget, Boesak said, •hat 
"the conditions required for a pc .. u .. eful 
resistance in South Africa arc simply 
not there . . . Simply not there as they 
have been in the United States for the 
civil rights problems with Martin 
Luther King." 

The prospects for successful non-
violent resistance seem slim, 
said 
Boesak, if one examines the last 
decades of history in South Africa. 
That history includes such incidents as 
Sharpeville, when in 1960, 69 people 
were killed for demonstrating peaceful-
ly against the pass-Jaws; Soweto, in 
J 976, 
when 
hundreds of school 
children were killed for protesting the 
unequal educational system. "In J 976, 
the government so openly, so ruthless-
ly, showed its intention that nothing, 
but literally nothing would stand in its 
way of executing the policies to which 
it had dedicated itself," Boesak said, 
the corners of his mouth tightening, 
squeezing out the word "nothing." 
"Nothing would stand in its way to 
maintain apartheid and 
therefore 
maintain the oppression and the over-
privileged economic, social and poli-
tical position of white South Africa. 
And so we came to understand that 
even the lives of children were not 
sacred in this regard." 

Later, on August 27, the day before 
Boesak's planned march 
to 
the 
Pollsmoor Prison where African Na-
tional 
Congress leader Nelson 
J\.1andela has been held for more than 
21J years, I excitedly turned on the 
radio and TV several times to hear 
about the planning of the march. By 
that evening, Boesak had been ar-
rested; the next day South African 
police broke up what remained of the 
march with whips, tear gas, attack 
dogs and rubber bullets. My comfor-
table anticipation followed by the reali-
ty of violence reminded me of Boesak's 
words about American "standing ova-
tions" and the difference in our coun-
tries. It's easy for us to cheer for non-
violent resistance with an ocean's 
distance to dilute the blood. 

Although he has now been released 
after nearly a month of solitary con-
finement, Allan Boesak is still not free. 
Today he can no longer speak at 
theology conferences in little towns in 
the United States-or anywhere else. 
He has turned in his passport, cannot 
address more than 10 people at a time, 
cannot speak to journalists, must 
report to the police every morning, 
must stay in his home at night. He 
faces up to 25 years imprisonment on 
each of three counts of "political 
subversion"- for 
advocating

. 
divestiture to Western nations, calling 
for school and economic boycotts, and 
. praying for the downfall of the South 
African government, just as he did at 
the conference in upstate New York. 

While in New York, he had said that 
he was lucky, that his position awarded 
him some protection, that he really had 
many more rights than most black or 
coloured South Africans. Now, that no 
longer matters. As he put it, "the South 
African government can do whatever it 
wants to me," as it has to so many 
before. 

Boesak has not only had to confront 
the oppressive nature of his nation's 
government, but also the racism of his 
own Dutch Reformed Church. That 
church historically has been a defender 
of apartheid; in fact, Boesak says that 
the roots of apartheid "lay in the bosom 
of the Dutch Reformed Church." 

What happens to people who are 
black-or "coloured"- in South Africa 
who decide to devote their lives to a 
church they have discovered to be 
racist? Jim Ellis, a friend who knew 
Boesak when he was first studying 
theology, 
told this story. 
He 
remembered 
that during 
Boesak's 
theological training, the two of them, 
along with some other friends from the

university, often spent Sunday after-
noons at a nearby women's teacher 
training college. When Boesak was or-
dained as 
a 
mtmster, 
he began 
preaching in that same small town near 
Cape Town. An old lady in that town 
used to feed the friends Sunday meals. 
One Sunday, she said to him: "You 
know, you preached a beautiful ser-
mon today, but I just got a letter say-
ing that I am a disqualified person in 
my own home. My own home that I 
have lived in all my life with my hus-
band, who's now dead and where I've-
raised all my children, and now I've 
got to leave. I've got to start all over 
again. How can I do that? Where am I 
going to go?" And she asked him, 
"Doesn't the Lord who you preached 
about so beautifully have anything to 
say about this kind of condition?" 

"I think that question that day, more 
than anything else, sent Allan on the 
course that he has followed ever since 
proclaiming that this vicious system in 
South Africa is . . . a heresy," conclud-
ed Ellis, now a professor at ~he Univer-
sity of Western Cape. 

For his 
religion 
to have any 
relevance in the world, Boesak decided 
the answer to the old woman's question 
must be, "Yes, the Lord does have 
something to say about this situation." 

"We discovered," Boesak said, widen-
ing his eyes in warning, pushing the 
words out of his tightened mouth, "that 
there is no way that we could stay out 
of the struggle, out of the active struggle 
for liberation." 

"The Bible is written by people who 
live, by definition, on the underside of 
history," 
Boesak said, explaining 
liberation theology. "That's why people 
who have too much don't understand 
too well what it says." He paused, look-
ing down for a moment. As he began 
to talk again, he almost whispered. 
"We were too afraid, too influenced by 
a Western privileged understanding of 
the Bible to understand the message of 
gospel. 
But when liberation 
theology came . . . " 

Boesak's voice became higher and 
higher. "We began to see how exciting 
a book the Bible really is, and how 
much dynamite it is under any op-
pressive structure in the world. Des-
mond Tutu is fond of saying that the 
government goes 
around banning every book that it 
thinks 
is 
too radical 
for 
us 
read- Karl Marx and whoever else 
those people might be," Boesak said, 
waving them aside with a hand in the 
air. "He says that what they never 
understood was that the dangerous 
book for black people to read in South 
Africa is the Bible; that's the book they 
$hould have banned. And they never 
did." 

Boesak explained that the Bible is 
revolutionary because to call Jesus 
Christ "'Lord of Lords" is to deny the 
authority of any unjust government. 
"Jesus Christ was calJed Lord, and he 
was executed as a rebel by the Roman 
government," Boesak said. "So because 
of this, 
political engagement is 
something that you do, not in spite of 
your discipleship of Jesus Christ, but 
as an integral part of it. You have no 
choice." 

In South Africa, being black or col-
oured means that you live on what 
Boesak called, in explaining liberation 
theology, "the underside of history." 
Because of this, the conclusions of 
liberation theology and the black con-
sciousness movement are intimately 
connected. Before he came to his 
radical understanding of the gospel, 
Boesak had been caught in what he 
called "the schizophrenia of in-
betweeness." 

"When you are born a coloured in 
South Africa," Boesak remembered, 
"you live with a perpetual mixed feel-
ing toward God. Because you would 
every now and then say to God, why in 
the world didn't you go a little bit fur-
ther and make me white? You came so 
close; wouldn't it have been much 
easier for all of us concerned? But 
then, of course, you look at other peo-
ple, and you say oh, well thank God, 
He didn't make me black." He spoke 
quickly, running his words together, a 
lifetime of conflicting emotion in one 
breath. "Really, you never knew where 
you belonged, or where you wanted to 
belong, or whether you would be 
welcomed by this group or by the other

required for a

lll 

group. They make you understand 
through the laws that everywhere you 
don't really belong anywhere." 

"Black consciousness," Boesak said, 
"changed all of that. All of that. That 
nonsense of not knowing where do I 
belong and what is my identity we 
threw out the window. First of all, we 
looked at ourselves, and said, black 
people, we have got to make up our 
own minds about what this situation is. 
We can no longer depend on the 
analysis of white people, however good 
and well-intentioned they may be. We 
have got to understand our own suffer-
ing in our own way." 

"The second thing we came to 
understand was that black con-
sciousness meant that we don't have to 
make excuses anymore because we 
were there . . . we weren't going to 
say, well, I'm sorry that God didn't 
make me white-Forget that! I am a per-
son, I am a human being, and nobody 
in this world is ever going to tell me 
any different from now on. In a coun-
try where racism is legitimized, is in-
stitutionalized ... is the very basis of 
the law, the very fabric of our society 
and our economic and social life . .. it 
was an incredible awareness for black 
people to no longer make excuses to 
white people, and most importantly, to 
ourselves, that we were black." 

"Now," Boesak said of black con-
sciousness, "that's very threatening to 
white people. Very threatening to 
white people when they're not so sure 
of their own position anyway, when 
they know they've had everything in 
life except peace of mind and the 
future." 

Boesak doesn't distinguish between 
politics in South Africa 
and the

religion
that
includes liberation
theology and black consciousness; in
fact, he joked that people tell him "they
hardly ever see the difference any
more" between
his sermons and
political speeches. In religious terms,
Boesak
decries the South
African
government's policy of apartheid as
heresy and blasphemy. In the words of
revolutionary politics, he calls for the
overthrow of the South African gov-
ernment. Combining both, he prays
for the government's downfall: apar-
theid, he preaches, must be irrevocably
eradicated. When he says that, he
stretches the "r's" out, sounding fiercely
certain about his conclusion.

Although religion and politics are
almost synonymou s for Boesak , he
would rather "be a pastor in a small
church somewhere" than a political
leader. Like Desmond Tutu, he feels
forced to be a leader in the opposition
movement, because all the original
political
leaders
have been -like
Nelson Mandela- imprisoned,
banned, or killed.

According to Boesak, these repressive
conditions
demand
more
than
cosmetic reform. He feels particularly
strongly
that the South African
government,
large corporations in
South Africa, and America's policy of
constructive engagement have done
nothing to end apartheid. The belief
that apartheid should be reformed,
rather than abolished, is the basis for
the Reagan administration's policy of
constructive engagement, or what is
now called "active constructive engage-
ment." But Boesak believes that apar-
theid must be ended, not just modi-
fied, so he refers to the views of people
like Thatcher and Reagan as "the soft·
legitimization of apartheid."

"In the last four or five years, the
beginning of the eighties until now, the
South African government began to
change the face of apartheid; there
were too many pressures from too
many places in the world. Their allies
in the world, notably people like Mr.
Reagan
and Mrs. Thatcher, and
others kept saying tg the South African
goverJ;'ment, 'You know we would
really like to go on supporting you, but
it is very embarrassing.' I can almost
hear Mrs. Thatcher ... " Boesak rais-
ed the pitch of his voice higher, mimick-
ing Thatcher. 'You know, Mr. Botha,
it is extremely embarrassing to be
caught on the side of naked racism in
South Africa.' Get rid of naked racism,
but hold onto the power. Be nice to
people; if you want to stab someone,
dojt nicely."


Hoesak sees ~outh Africa's new con-
stitution of 1983 as a perfect example
of the failure of international pressure
to truly push
the South African
government to abolish apartheid. The
constitution contains some reforms.
but Boesak says that it is still racist. "It
entrenches apartheid. All of the basic
laws have remained the same. It en-
trenches white minority rule. It is
based on the continuation of policies
like the homeland policy, which means
that the denationalization of black peo-
ple would continue, which means that
forced removals ·would continue. It
doesn't make any fundamental change
in our society's structures."

Boesak therefore urges nations and
companies in the West to divest from
holdings in South Africa. "But asking
for divestment isn't all one should do,"
Boesak cautioned. "There is also the
question of alterna"tive investment;
also the question of further support for

our struggle in South Africa." He
hopes also that people in the United
States will use the opportunity for pro-
test that does exist in this country to
pressure · the Reagan administration
not to give diplomatic and political
support to South Africa.

Boesak said also that he would now
think much more carefully about ac-
cepting an honorary degree from Yale,
in view of the fact that the University
has. not divested. "I had hoped that by
accepting the degree, that Yale was ac-
tually tying itself to the cause that we
stand for . . . and they are not doing
that. We have to consider what kind of
action we should take if Yale should
continue to support apartheid through
their continued investments, going
against the express wishes of so large a
majority of black people in South
Africa."

"The fiery anti-apartheid leader,"
they called him. But, talking about the
deaths of his friends and the oppression
of his people, he was restrained. Once
he shook his fist in the air, then
brought it down softly to the lectern.
That absence of sound was jarring. I
expected, from his words, from the
sad, angry look in his eyes, that he
would pound the table in front of him.
I thought it misleading to call him
"fiery." It is not he and others like him
who are
setting
fire
to
South
Africa,
but the structures
;:wd
~he people who maintain apartheid.

He was arrested as he was driv-
ing to a university to try to calm, not
provoke, a student protest. But sud-
denly, he was the antagonist, he and all
other blacks there marching and pro-
testing. The real "fire" doesn't come
from those who are oppressed, but the
oppressors.

"If you have too much, you don't
understand too well ... " His words
echo. I see, again and again, that
clenched fist that didn't pound, that
taut mouth as he spoke very softly,
disturbingly, prophetically. "Every day
people are dying. I deep down cannot
believe that violence will solve the
problems, but I don't know what will
happen ... "

Arlene Seabrook with her children Shantain, Roger, and Mark .
Living wi!h a .'!lew_ of prosperity and green yards on Mansfield Street

Hurricane Gloria left New Haven with
uprooted trees and little electricity.
Every light hooked to the Yale gen-
erator functioned, but much of the city
sat in darkness, nothing but darkness
up Dixwell Avenue, blocks up into
Dixwell Plaza and parts of Elm Haven.
From her seventh-floor apartment in
an Elm Haven high-rise, Arlene Sea-
brook could hear shooting out at the
Plaza, a minor entrepreneurial fiasco
of small, always empty stores set off
from Dixwell Avenue by a bare park-
ing lot. Although her four rooms were
lit, she knew that out at the Plaza, with
the streetlights out and the stores
closed, it must be totally black. Perfect
for looters to run through and ransack
the clothing store and the fish market.
Her three children were in bed, her
mother next door, and after waking
early this morning to the violent rain,
she could finally sit down, alone. The
looting was audible, but Arlene was
more concerned with the damage the
storm had done to her own apartment.
The wind had jumbled and tossed the
few things on the small balcony outside
her living room windows. It had
broken one window pane, and who
knew when the Housing Authority
would come and fix it?

Because the Authority operates all
the subsidized housing in the New
Haven area, it probably had other
priontles in Elm Haven, perhaps
clearing out the garbage on the grate in
front of the building or fixing an
elevator in a neighboring high-rise. In
a strange way, it would be futile for the
Authority to fix Arlene's window in
October when she, like the other
tenants of 180 Canal Street, is ex-
pected to leave her apartment in
December. By 1988, the six high-rises
of the Elm Haven projects should be
empty, if the Department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD) pro-
vides necessary funding, and the 1200
high-rise inhabitants will be relocated
to two- and three-story low-rises all
over the city, living with a few other
families. The graffiti-layered walls, in-
operable elevators, and Arlene
Seabrook's balcony will be hammered
into rubble, while the city brings in
paint, tools, and blueprints to modern-
ize Elm Haven's low-rises. In several
years, the tract from Dixwell Avenue
to Canal Street, Yale to Science Park

will be transformed into a mixed-
income neighborhood, with houses 
and apartments, a variety of residents, 
ample parking, and safety. 
Ironically, most of Elm Haven was 
built in 1940 as an escape from the 
city's slums, housing for those dis-
placed by the construction of the Oak 
Street connector. But in 45 years, 
everything has 
moved 
perversely 
backward. The brainchild of New 
Haven and HUD reminds anyone 
walking down Henry Street of the 
crumbling of the city's neighborhoods 
and of the staggering number of im-
poverished citizens in this town. The 
1980 census provided the hard num-
bers that drove home the effects of 
years of deterioration: 25.2 percent of 
the population lives below the poverty 
line, making New Haven the seventh 
poorest city in the nation. And Elm 
Haven is the poorest section of one of 
America's poorest cities. Now, the 
Housing Authority has returned to 
HUD, asking $40 to $50 million to 
fund the renovation of the neigh-
borhood. 

Yet more than age and weather con-
tributed to the fraying of Elm Haven; 
mere wear-and-tear doesn't necessitate 
demolition. But jobs and revenues 
have drained .away from the city into 
the suburbs and the Sun Belt, educa-
tion has declined, and indifference 
may have set in downtown. Many who 
left Elm Haven left it entirely, forget-
ting their old apartments and neigh-
bors. Others, like Arlene Seabrook, 
are still waiting to leave a place they 
have never called home. 

"When I was little, me and some 
friends would ride our bikes past here, 
and I used to say 'I never want to live 
there," Arlene said. Perhaps she rode 
her bike down Henry Street, three 
blocks in from Dixwell, and saw the 
apartment building that she would 
move into years later. The road in 
front of her high-rise, Canal Street, 
seems more like a long driveway, in-
significant in comparison to the now-
rejuvenated Olin Chemical complex 
across from it, low tan buildings sur-
rounded by a high link fence and 
barbed wire, one corner of Science 
Park. From Arlene's living room win-
dows, she can see one long, white 
building of the U.S. Repeating Arms 
factory, a company that had employed 
many first generation Elm Haven 
tenants right after World War II. 

Sitting in the living room the day 
after the storm, Arlene still kept the 
shades drawn, leaving the room cool 
and dim. A thick, dark rust rug, beige 
H erculon sofas melt into the shadows, 
but the frames on her walls and the 
portraits of herself and her children are 
brightly colored- orange sunset back-
drops, 
blue vests, crisp white 
babyclothes. Arlene's two sons, Mark, 
10, and Roger, five, abandoned watch-
ing Popeye in the living room and 
played in an adjacent bedroom. She sat 
on the coffee table, and across from her 
on the sofa sat her two-year-old 
daughter Shantain, reaching out and 
offering her mother a sock. With her 
full face and broad smile, Arlene 
doesn't look very different from a pic-
ture on the wall taken of her in high 
school. 

In 1966, when Arlene was eight, she 
and her mother, Mary Seabrook, came 
north to Connecticut from their family 
home in South Carolina, part of a se-
cond wave of residents for once-
middle-class neighborhoods like the 
Hill, Fair Haven, and Elm Haven 
after many of the post-World War II 
generation had 
educated their 
children, 
retired , 
and 
elsewhere. Arlene's own three children 
are growing up in New Haven know-
ing little of their mother's ties down 
South. The South is home. Buford, 
South Carolina, right next to Parris 
Island. Most of her family still lives 
there, in brick houses or trailer homes, 
situated on their own land. Some tried 
life in Connecticut, but all except 
Arlene and her mother have left the 
state. In fact, when Mary and Arlene-
first moved to Connecticut, they lived 
with Mary's sister in Stamford. Mary 
believed she could find well-paying 
jobs here, but ended up taking laundry 
and domestic work. After nine months 
at her sister's, Mary came to New 
Haven with her daughter. 

The house they lived in with six 
other families on the Hill, at 724 Con-
gress Avenue, has since been con-
demned, but while Arlene grew up 
there, she was surrounded by one large 
family knit from the seven. She had 
places to play outside, a yard. Still, her 
mother could not find decent work in 
New Haven, and so went back South 
in 197 4. She lived there for eight 
months, and she would have remained 
had she not been diagnosed as having 
hypertension. She returned to Connec-
ticut for treatment, and because of the 
medical care, decided to stay. Because 
her doctors pressured the Housing 
Authority, Mary received a subsidized 
apartment in Elm Haven that same 
year. "My mother wanted me to come 
with her, but I cried when she told me 
we were moving to the projects," 
Arlene said, as she picked up her 
children's hairbrush from the coffee 
table. "None of my friends lived here. 
Today, you live with people for 12 
years, and they just aren't friendly. 
They're not together. Everybody is 
against everybody." 

After years on the same floor, in the 
same rooms, Arlene calls Elm Haven 
"the 
projects" with 
a 
scorn 
restlessness compounded by her view 
of Mansfield Street and its tidy homes 
and lawns. But in the forties and fif-
ties, Elm Haven differed little from the 
middle-class neighborhoods at its 
borders. John Daniels, whose parents 
moved there after the War, remembers 
blocks without the high-rises later built 
in 1955, tenants who were proud of 
their apartments, and a city that main-
tained its public housing. Because 
most families had two paychecks com-
ing in from the same few companies, 
everyone was in the same economic 
class. Back then it was a neighborhood. 

Later, Daniels went to school, left Elm 
Haven, and eventually was elected in

1979 to represent the district that in-
cludes Elm Haven in the Connecticut 
State Senate. 

Daniels believes the changes in Elm 
Haven came as population swelled and 
jobs disappeared in the late sixties and 
early seventies. Like Mary Seabrook, 
many rural, unskilled blacks from the 
South migrated north searching for a 
better life. But the heavy industry that 
once thrived in New Haven and hired 
the unskilled had either left the city or 
simply died. "There were no jobs, so 
many of them were on public assis-
tance," Daniels explained. "They lived 
in public housing, but there were cuts 
in the 
city's services and, 
sim-
ulaneously, high taxes. But Dixwell 
was no 'longer a priority for the city; 
most felt it was a burden. Elm Haven 
had no political clout- the people 
weren't taxpayers." 

The frustration of the unemployed, 
storms, bitter winters, and time con-
stantly added new scars to Elm Haven. 
When Arlene moved in 11 years ago, 
however, Elm Haven still had mail-
boxes in every building, laundry 
rooms, and doors that locked. Now, 
washers and dryers are four blocks 
away at a Dixwell Avenue laundromat, 
and all the mailboxes are in one 
building, open only from nine a.m. to 
four p.m. The dirt and disrepair which 
Arlene passed by everyday, and the 
complaints of individuals about living 
conditions received little attention. 
Then, .in 
December 
1981, 
many 
tenants m the high-rises had problems 
with their heating and hot water; either 
they had none at all or far too much. It 
had happened every winter, but this 
time, a group of tenants took their 
complaint to 
New 
Haven 
Legal 
Assistance, not the Housing Authori-
ty. With the help of Legal Assistance, 
the residents formed the Elm Haven 
Tenants Association and filed a class 
action suit against the Authority, 
'demanding immediate repairs to their 
buildings. The Court ruled in favor of 
the tenants, and the Authority then 
petitioned HUD for two million dollars 
to install new boilers. 

By this time, both tenants and the 
Authority realized that much of Elm 
Haven had become uninhabitable, 
even unsalvageable. Therefore, the 
Authority worked closely with the 
tenants' group for two years, and in 
December 1983, released the Elm 
Haven Design Charette, a report 
which sought to ch'ange dramatically 
the living situation of the tenants. 

Whatever improvements had been 
made over the years were only tem-
porary, merely delaying the rampant 
deterioration. As a long-term solution 
to the problems of Elm Haven, the 
Charette report proposed that HUD 
fund the destruction of the high-rises, 
the renovation of the low-rises and the 
construction of more low-rise apart-
ments in the neighborhood. 

The money from HUD will go not 
only to the redevelopment of Elm 
Haven, but to the building of low-rises 
around the city. For years bureaucrats 
and social scientists relied on large-
scale projects to house the poor. But 
acre upon acre of run-down buildings 
only convinced tenants that they lived 
in a ghetto. And what does it matter to 
break a window or write on the walls if 
you live in a ghetto? Realizing the 
anger and hopelessness that they had 
piled into 10 stories, the Authority ad-
vocated in the Charette report the scat-
tered site housing approach, by which 
one to four families live together in 
low-rises in middle-class neighbor-
hoods. Although the new maneuver 
will not eradicate poverty, it will, the 
Authority claims, improve the lives of


--- Page 27 ---

New H aven's poor. "Tearing down the 
high-rises will have a great impact on 
the families of Elm Haven," said Linda 
Evans, executive director of the New 
Haven Housing Authority. "They will 
have hope for the future; they will 
begin planning things again. They will 
look for jobs, buy furniture. Their 
children will be going to better schools. 
Right now, no one knows oppor-
tunity." 

Expected to 
move soon, Mary 
Seabrook received a list of five possible 
new homes, none of which, unfor-
tunately, appealed to her. Arlene wor-
ries that may happen to her as well. 
M ostly, she wants a place where her 
children can play outside and feel safe, 
as she had felt while living on the Hill 
and earlier, in South Carolina. "Here, 
they stay in that room," Arlene said, 
pointing with the hairbrush at the 
bedroom behind her. "I won't let them 
go out around here." 

"What if something happened to 
them out there? I live too high up. 
What can I do? By the time I get there, 
they'll be messed up, or dead, or gone." 
Arlene 
shook 
her 
head sternly. 
"They're not old enough to go out. 
They don't go out unless I do." 

"One time, I sent M a rk to the 
grocery store on the corner," Arlene 
recalled. "He was robbed by two little 
boys. They took his ice cream and his 
money. H e's a quiet kid, other kids like 
to pick on him. If I'd ever caught up 
with those kids ... " She half-jokingly 
made a tight fist and shook it. 

If Mark and Roger don't return 
home from school by 2:40 p.m. every 
day, Arlene goes and looks for them. 
From early morning until they go to 
sleep at 9 p.m., the children are 
Arlene's sole concern, perhaps because 
both her sons are sickly, Roger with 
asthma and Mark with kidney prob-
lems. Although Mark is the oldest of 
her children, Arlene worries more 
about him than the others. When he 
was five days old, Mary felt his 
stomach an.d discovered it was very 
hard. Arlene took him to the hospital 
and found that he needed one of his 
kidneys removed. For three and a half 
years, she shuttled her son to and from 
the hospital every few weeks. 

If she were sure daycare or baby-
sitters would adequately care for her 
"How do they expect 
the poorest of the 
poor to survive? They 
think that by putting 
new windows there 
(Elm Haven), they're 
making things better." 
children, Arlene would more actively 
look for a job. But she becomes very 
uneasy at the thought of leaving her 
children with other people, imagining 
herself at work looking at her watch 
every few minutes, hoping to leave and 
check up on her kids. She waits instead 
for Shantain to grow old enough for 
school so she can look for work once 
more. "If I had money now, I'd let 
them do things," she said. "But I don't 
have money. If my child wants to play 
an instrument, he can't. If it isn't free, 
we can't do it. 

"Through all this, I feel good. Some 
people are millionaires, but they don't 
have kids. I have nothing, but I have 
my kids. And I tell them, 'There's 
always going to be momma when there 
isn't daddy.' My momma did fine. 
None of her kids are alcoholics or drug 
addicts. I want to tell her , 'Praise 
yourself, lady. You did good with your 
kids."' 

Arlene gave birth to Mark when she 
was 17, a junior at Lee High School. 
Her pregnancy forced her to ask 
herself what she should do, until her 
mother simply told her to have the 
baby. She left Lee for a year and went 
to the Polly T . McCabe Center, a 
school 
for 
pregnant teenagers. 

Although Arlene and Mark lived at 
home, Mark's father gave them finan-
cial support for a short while. Finally, 
Mark's father demanded Arlene spend 
all her time just with him, and after 
many fights, they broke up. Five years 
later, when she was pregnant with 
Roger by a different man, Arlene con-
sidered having an abortion. "But 
I realized that the baby didn't ask to 
come here. So why kill it?" she said. "I 
took care of my first child, and I would 
take care of this one, I thought.'' 

Although her sons were unplanned, 
Arlene wanted to have Shantain, 
whose father she had been dating for 
five years and who wanted to m arry 
her. But when he became zealously 
.religious, she broke the engagement. 

To much of the white, middle class, 
is just another "welfare 
mother," having kids so she won't have 
to work. She is so acutely aware of the 
labels attached to her, and how they 
would disappear if she were a white 
woman. "I hear on Phil Donahue that 
people don't like us state people 
because we're this or that. But how can

"Why do you get a job without a start?" Arlene asked, striking her thigh with the hair-brush. "'Why do you keep having kids if you're on the state?' Who, who are you to question my life? If the state won't give me money, fine. I'll go home and live off the fields like my parents did." 

She hears the questions and insinuations from not only strangers and the media, but from social workers every six months, when Arlene has her welfare status reassessed. "Who are you living with? Is he giving you any money?" Each month, she receives from the state about $542 to pay for food, clothing, rent, telephone, and any other expenses that may arise. "Five hundred and forty dollars is nothing for four people. You're lucky if you have anything left at the end of the month," Arlene said. "If you don't budget, look at everything, you go hungry. It's $115 dollars for food stamps," she said, fingering the arithmetic on her wrist, "and $180 for rent, and all out of the same little bit of money. A lot of times, you just go without. I'm not knocking the state, I guess; no one else takes care of me." 

Still, Arlene feels the state seldom helps people who try to find a job and get off welfare. If she finds part-time work that pays her only $150 a week, she would have that deducted from her check, no matter how many children she has, no matter that on $150 a week, Arlene would make only $7500 annually, far below the poverty line of about $10,000. With additional checks, her rent, which is based on percentage of income, goes up, too. The only way Arlene can leave Elm Haven, and subsidized housing entirely, is not by waiting for the grand redevelopment but by getting a job. And despite the commonly held vision of impoverished New Haven, Arlene believes that she can find a job in this city. With only a high school degree, however, and years away from the summers when she worked on government-subsidized programs, Arlene hears from employers only demands for college and trade school degrees.


Having applied for jobs all over New Haven, she also understands the subtle racism at work when hiring. "In Macy's, do you ever see a black girl at the cosmetic counter? Hell, no! It has a lot of black employees, but they're back in the stockroom, packing and taking clothes in." 

Much of the city has placed its hopes for an employment boom on Science Park, Arlene's next door neighbor, which has already hired one-fifth of its nearly 500 employees from the Dixwell-Newhallville area. Yet Arlene knows little about the venture, who they have hired and what exactly they do. She, like many in Elm Haven, suspects that Science Park doesn't like sitting next to the projects. Outside of Elm Haven, others have different fears about the benefits Science Park will bring to the poor of this town. Unlike Arlene, it is not so much that the complex won't hire but will never be successful enough to employ large numbers of New Haveners. 

Yet Peter Gray, executive director of the Dixwell Neighborhood Corporation, has to believe in Science Park, "the only game in town." Like Senator Daniels, Gray grew up in a middle-class Elm Haven, and has worked for the last 15 years in the Corporation, trying to find jobs and a better way of life for his old neighbors and their children. Gray feels that for the thousands of disenfranchised New Haveners to leave poverty behind, the city, Yale, and Science Park must not only work together but show genuine commitment. Yet Gray asserts that the poor of New Haven were never a priority at City Hall. "For years, the city has been remiss. It has hired, on connections, political hacks rather than those who have a concern for public housing," Gray said emphatically. "How do they expect the poorest of the poor to survive? They think that by putting new windows there (Elm Haven), they're making things better." 

Gray points to Lake Place, a street right behind Payne Whitney Gym, as the result of true cooperation between Yale, the city, and the Corporation. Once a hangout for junkies, Lake Place is now a mixed-income neighborhood, housing New Haveners and Yale students alike. But projects like Lake Place are too rare for Gray. He contends the city is instead fixated with downtown development, relying on the "trickle down theory" to explain how the Palace and the Mall benefit all of New Haven. "The downtown development is crazy," Gray said. "It's like a head without the other parts. The projects in the outlying areas are the arms and legs of the city. For every project in downtown, I'd like Schiavone or whomever to do a project in the neighborhoods. A large percentage of the workers hired for both downtown and neighborhood projects should be from the poorer sections of town." 

But the bulk of the responsibility for renovating the neighborhoods lies with New Haven's blacks, Gray asserts. Too many of the first, middle-class Elm Haven generation have left the neighborhood; only a few in the Dixwell area are lifelong residents. Although he does not list ways black can help black, he maintains middle-class blacks have joined with whites against the demands of poorer blacks. "Many of the people who lived in the projects come back, forgetting it's no longer new. And they say, 'Those new people are terrible. They've torn everything up.' But people have been living there for 45 years!" Gray said. "You can't blame the guy on the bottom for what's happening. Hundreds of people left the housing. Rather than call the others names, they should reach back and help them get out." 

Arlene has probably never spoken with Gray nor heard about the need to return for those who can't leave. Right now, she cares only about her escape from the projects. She is trying to save money to go to South Carolina next summer, perhaps to stay there. At 27, she is still young, and comments on the fact that her sisters' lives didn't come together until they were in their thirties. "Down south, there are small houses. Give me a yard, a little fence," she draws a square in the air. "If I ever get a break, some money, yes, I am going home."

The Philosophy Repressed 
Freud for Historians 
Peter Gay 
1985 Oxford University Press 
252 pp., $17.95 

When a historian concludes his analysis of an event in Woodrow Wilson's life with the words, "the vagaries of his mind are unfathomable," is he exercising commendable historical caution or giving up too soon? Should he go on to explore the links between the incident and Wilson's childhood, his feelings towards his parents, his Oedipal complex? 

In his new book, Freud for Historians, Sterling Professor of History Peter Gay argues that the use of Freudian theory can make fathomable the vagaries of Wilson's mind, as well as elucidate the passions and motivations of other historical actors, even entire historical eras. But Gay makes his case cautiously, advising his readers that psychoanalysis "is not a miracle drug or a magic password; it is an informed style of inquiry, supplying answers no one thought were available before or- even more important- suggesting questions no one had thought to ask." 

Although Freudian theory long ago filtered into the fields of literary criticism, anthropology, and sociology, historians have been slow to put it to any broad or systematic use. 
"Psychohistory," the term used to describe historiography that employs psychoanalytic concepts, has always evoked derogatory connotations: vague theories about national Oedipal complexes or the reduction of revolutions to the simple fact of somebody's repressed aggression. Yet from its earliest pages, Freud for Historians establishes itself as a sophisticated, undogmatic defense of the need for Freudian theory in historical studies. 

Gay acknowledges that some of the charges against psychohistory are valid. Past efforts to "psychoanalyze the dead" have either produced confusing descriptions of "cures" for neurotic historical figures or relied too heavily upon the absolute letter of Freudian theory. Most infuriatingly, many psychohistorians have dismissed their critics by claiming that the resistance to Freudian analysis merely proves its concepts more conclusively: critics of psychohistory are providing evidence of their own repression and resistance to cure. Gay wastes no time defending the often flawed past historical uses of psychoanalysis. Instead he bases his argument upon one simple premise: if historians are going to discuss human emotions and passions, they must proceed from a rigorous methodology and a clearly defined set of assumptions. 

Gay begins his case for psycho-history by pointing out that "the professional historian has always been a psychologist- an amateur psychologist." 

In other words, the search for explanations has always forced historians to rely upon a set of assumptions about the feelings and passions of human beings, whether or not they are aware of doing so. One historian may attribute a naval victory to "morale," another may explain the exploration of the New World as the product of "dissatisfaction" with the Old. 

In particular, Gay notes that many historians are given to using "self-interest" as the all-encompassing motive for economic and political actions, even when such actions are dressed up in the language of patriotism or philanthropy. Yet what are self-interest, greed or lack of sympathy but psychological states produced by interaction with social and cultural norms? Gay's point is that self-interest and the rhetoric that conceals self-interest do not occur at random, but are the products of specific historical conditions. Historians who describe an event as the simple product of self-interest may have settled for a facile explanation. For Gay, the use of psychoanalytic concepts provides a more systematic way to discuss motivation, going beyond common sense platitudes about human nature. 

Ironically, Gay is arguing that psychoanalysis, a methodology often described as reductionist, over-simplified, and even irrelevant, is actually more thorough than traditional historiography. 

Gay continues his defense of sophisticated psychohistory by explaining how Freudian theory explains both humanity's similarities and its cultural differences. We may all have the same sexual drive and the same aggressions, but they manifest themselves differently in different historical and cultural circumstances. Psychohistorians unreceptive to this possibility for variation and difference have missed out on the profundity of Freud and the profundity of history. Gay also points out the utility of Freud's emphasis upon irrationality in human behavior. Too often, historians looking for rational explanations of human actions forget to consider the irrational. Remembering that human beings rarely act upon clearly perceived reasons can help historians explain the mysterious and

illogical actions of otherwise logical 
people. 

Gay's description of the human 
mind as depicted by Freud and his ex-
planation of why psychoanalysis can 
and should be used by historians are 
both very convincing. The only major 
stumbling block to Gay's argument are 
his implications that we need to accept 
as correct the body of Freud's work. 

Gay's defense of the need for psycho-
history is convincing, but his de-
fense of Freud and the superiority of 
Freudian theory is not. Although {.;ay 
devotes an entire chapter justifying his 
preference of standard Freudianism to 
other forms of psychoanalysis, he 
doesn't offer a convincing argument 
why the map of the human mind 
drawn by a 19th century Viennese doc-
tor is the last word in the discussion. 

Gay acknowledges that psychoanalysis 
is "fallible, incompletely tested, dif-
ficult to apply", but he does not sug-
gest, at least in this book, that there 
could have been anything substantially 
wrong with Freud's thought. Gay may 
not condone historians who quote 
Freud as an authority, but he does call 
Freud's stature in the history of the 
modern mind "virtually unique," a 
strong claim .to make for one man. 

Granted, Gay's book is a defense of 
Freud- not 
the best arena 
for 
criticism- but to propose the use of 
Freudian theory as anything but a 
beginning research hypothesis exposes 
Gay to the same charges of reduc-
tionism and 
lack of perspective 
that 
Freud's 
disciples 
have. been 
defending themselves against for the 
last 80 years, the same charges that 
Gay's book attempts to put to rest. A 
model must be found if we are going to 
talk about the human psyche, but that 
model must remain open to criticism if 
its use is to be at all progressive. 

As Gay recognizes, the issue at hand 
is no less than the nature of history 
itself: whether we simply write history 
over and over again from a new 
standpoint of the era, or whether the 
study of history actually gets better and 
better, and can be more or less 
truthfuL And in short, Gay seems to 
propose that the stable, unchanging 
theory of human nature offered by 
psychoanalytic theory provides a 
virtually certain way out of historical 
subjectivism, implying that Freudian 
theory goes beyond the individual 
biases- and neuroses-of particular 
historians. 

There is nothing inherently wrong 
with Gay's original project. If 
historians are going to discuss human 
motivations and passions, a search for 
standards and methods of description 
can only be beneficial. Even the 
common 
language 
the 
terminology of psychoanalysis 
provides can only make such 
discussion between historians easier. 

However , when the historian begins to 
talk about dependability and certainty, 
when the assumptions of the Freudian 
model or any 
model 
are left 
unchallenged, the use of psychoanaly-
sis closes oiT rather than opens up the 
exploration of the human mind.
