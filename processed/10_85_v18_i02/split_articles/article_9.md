provides salary increa.ses, job security, 
and new benefits for all C&Ts. But 
Union acuvtsts allege that Yale 
managers are not treating workers 
with a respect commensurate to the 
gaina. They charge that management 
now disciplines them for minor infrac-
tiolll aa part of a broader effort to rid 
Yale of the Union. To challenge this at-
tempt, 
Local 34 has 
initiated a 
grievance-filing campaign. The Union 
encourages workers to contest unwar-
ranted disciplinary measures by 
~nting cases before their super-
~n. If a case is denied at this stage, 
It can be presented before a represen-
tative at Human Resources (Person-
nel), and if denied there, the Union 
BOel 
to the Director of Human 
Retources. There are no expenses for 
~ 
first three steps. But if the case 
faila again and the Union feels that its 
contention is strong, it can bring the 
matter before the American Arbitra-
l~ Board, a body comprised of un-
biQed labor lawyers. The party that 
Io.ea the arbitration case must pay all 
Qpenaes. 

The Union's grievance-filing cam-
~111 has taken hold in Sterling 
&..IOrary, where C&Ts have fiJed 20 
P'ievances since the strike's end, 14 of 
which were settled at the second step 
and aix at the third. "There's a lot of

tional responsibilities for the Union 
whenever she can find a spare mo-
ment. Serving on the Local 34 ex-
ecutive board and as a union steward 
in the ijbrary, she has represented both 
herself and other workers during 
grievance procedures. 

Gergen, who has received several 
oral and written disciplinary notices 
from her supervisor, is oangry. Her 
boss recently reprimanded her for 
speaking with a 
co-worker about 
union business after lunch. "Had I 
gone up there to ask him for his recipe 
for Brunswick stew and stayed for 20 
minutes, no one would have cared. 
Just the fact tbat 'it was union business 
gets me a disciplinary letter m my file." 
The letter, Gergen believes, is the first 
step in finding cause to fire her. She 
describes post-strike Sterling as closely 
resembling 
a 
14th-century feudal 
manor. Tales abound of supervisors 
following employees to the bathroom 
during working hours and eavesdrop-
ping on their conversations, hoping to 
catch them discussing Union matters 
on the job. Gergen feels that manage-
ment is constantly watching her. She 
cannot even make short phone calls to 
other i.lnio'n members to set lunch 
dates without fearing that "higher-ups" 
will discover the transgression and 
discipline her. 

"What I see is union leaders trying to 
turn their university jobs into full-time 
union activities," said Peter Vallone, 
vice-president of human resources. 
"Consequently, we have to remind 
these employees that they still work for 
Yale." Casually leaning back in his ex-
ecutive swivel armchair, Vallone con-
tinued to speak acros s the length of a 
conference table. "We ha' ~ employees 
active in the Union who do have prob-
lems because they think they can go 
wherever they want, when they want. 
We don't agree with their attitude-
'Hey, we can't be touched because 
w,.!re in the Union. · 
Vallone 01rected personnel for the Il-
linois government before joining the 
Yale administrative staff four months 
ago. With a considerable amount of 
negotiating experience behind him but 
never a strike, Vallone was attracted 
by Yale's dubious distinction of having 
weathered five strikes in 15 years. He 
felt that he could offer Yale a new 
perspective on labor relations. Now, 
however, 
Vallone questions the 
perception 
that tensions 
between 
Local 34 and the Yale administration 
are increasing again. In an article from 
the September 11 , 1985 issue of The 
N~ Havm Register, Vallone went so far 
as to report that there is "extremely 
high morale" at Sterling Library. 

Vallone's reasons for optimistic 
public statements elude most Union 
act1v1sts. 
Many are suspicious of 
management's stringent emphasis on 
rules and regulations, a move that has 
effectively deprived 
some library 
C&Ts of past autonomy. For instance, 
there is the currently disputed issue of 
flextime. In Sterling, which employs 
more C&Ts than any other building on 
campus, the methods of administration 
before the strike wer<: very irregular. 
Sterling was, and still is to some ex-
tent, a kingdom with fiefdoms in every 
nook and cranny. Flextime, a program 
initiated in the seventies, permitted 
employees to work overtime when 
their services were most in demand 
without extra pay. Instead of the extra 
pay, workers were allowed to accum-
ulate hours for future time off during 
slow months. Under the new contract, 
the University is legally bound to pay 
time-and-a-half to any employee who 
works beyond 37.5 hours in a week, 
regardless of the worker's wish to 
forego extra pay in lieu of future time 
off. 

The University, however, is reluc-
tant to pay overtime. Therefore, 
workers who stay late must seek the ap-
proval from their supervisor. Gergen, 
who was recently reprimanded for 
staying at work 15 minutes past her 
shift, believes that these new rules have 
appeared because the library manage-
ment, 
threatened by 
the UnioJ?'S 
strength, is clinging desperately to its 
power. "All of these new rules and . 
regulations have nothing to do with 
getting the work done, but everything 
to do with teaching us our places and 
keeping us in line." she said. "I don't 
have to be shown who's boss in here. 
But I don't want to be treated as 
anything less 
than a 
responsible 
human being." 

Not far from Gergen's post in the

;Microtext room, at the opposite end of 
the same dark hallway, is the office of 
the opposition, Deputy University 
Librarian Jack Siggins. His wife and 
Director of Library Personnel, 
Maur:een Sullivan, sits with Siggins in 
his 
well-lit and spacious 
office 
overlooking the courtyard. The mood 
in the room is calm, rational and even 
understanding. 

Although Unionists 
might describe the pair as tyrants, they 
keep such characteristics well hidden. 
During the Sterling demonstration on 
June 12, Sullivan received a hand-
delivered letter of protest as w.orkers 
marched through the libra.ry with 
union cards held high above their 
heads. But Sullivan had expected ten-
sions to arise during the re-entry 
period 
after the striking workers 
returned to the library last December. 
"I anticipated worse problems than we 
have had," she said. "Most people 
returned with the mind to re-establish 
working relationships. They came 
back to do their jobs." 

Both administrators claim that by 
adhering to the rules and regulations 
outlined in the new contract, they have 
been able to encourage good relations 
between workers and management. 
"We're trying to implement a contract, 
and it's causing us to examine our ap-
proach, which needs to be fair and con-
sistent throughout the library," 
Sullivan said. "It's true, we are cen-
tralizing." 

Ironically, as the case of flextime 
demonstrates, 
the new contract's 
specificity has led some union mem-
bers to the conclusion that the manage-
ment, out of vindiction, is tightening 
its grip on the library staff. Neither 
Sullivan nor Siggins believes in the 
validity of the Union's accusations of 
harrassment. Many of the conflicts, ac-
cording to Sullivan, stem from per-
sonal matters. She feels that blaming 
them on library supervisors or on Yale 
administrators "is just finding a con-
venient 
scapegoat." 
Siggins sup-
ported her statement, "There are just 
some people who don't accept the con-
tract for what it is. Their view is. '\'\'hat 
I have is mine and what you have, we'll 
.share." But things will change," he 
added wi•h a chuckle. "It just takes 
time." 

Yale hired Siggins and many other

· who had already opted not to join. One 
. day a union steward from her depart-
. ment approached the manager to ask if 
he could hold a lunch meeting with 
several other stewards in one of the 
available 
rooms. 
The supervisor 
agreed and suggested the staff room. 
Stevens 
and several other non-
members objected, asking that the 
·supervisor tell the stewards to meet in 
an adjacent room. The stewards re-
fused, stating that their meeting was 
open and anyone could listen to it. To 
Stevens, however, that was just the 
point. She and her co-workers did not 
want to hear the Union's business over 
lunch. According to her, the manager 
would not push the issue any further. 
"Managers are too reluctant to stand 
up for the rights of their non- union 
workers for fear of being burned by 
grievances," she 
explained. "The 
management goes by the rules so much 
that it fails to reach out to us." 

Indeed, 
those 
who 
must ad-
ministrate both union and non-union 
workers become entangled in the con-
flicts between the two groups and in 
the end are scorned by both. Managers 
walk a very thin line. Union activists 
charge that managetnent singles them 
out for discipline while courting the 
non-members. And such accusations 
are countered by many non-Unionists, 
like Stevens, who . assert that super-
visors bend so far over backward to 
avoid conflict with union workers that 
they neglect those employees who kept 
the University running during the 
strike, for whose work the tnanagers 
received credit. "We feel we deserve at 
least a pat on the back or sotnething. 
Free coffee and doughnuts doesn't 
amount to much," she said, referring 
to a gathering held in Sterling during 
• 
~ "If people called you 
i" names on the street, 
2 are you supposed to 
forget that?" 
... 
~ the 
conflict 
for 
the non-striking 
0 workers. "The University's ·continued 
negligence only adds insult to injury." 

All three- union members, non-
members, and management 
_do agree 
on one matter: that life would be much 
simpler if the University could bargain 
with a workforce that was either entire-
ly unionized, or not at all. A~ it stands, 
the bargaining unit, Local 34, is 
employed as an agency shop, as op-
posed to an open or closed shop. This 
· means that the Union is bound by 
federal law to represent all C&Ts at 
Yale, whether or not they actually 
belong to the organization. As a result, 
C&Ts who went on strike feel used by 
those who, although they crossed 
picketlines, still benefit from the hard-
won contract. 

However, at Union headquarters 
on 88 Prospect Street, officials speak of 
forgiveness and unity. "While it isn't 
easy to bury the hatchet when it's been 
in your back for so long, it would be 
good to have them in the Union. Good 
for us and good for them," said 
Michael Boyle '79, 
one 
.. of 
the 
six paid union officials. On the second 
floor, next to the headquarters of Local 
35, Boyle shares office space with at 
least three other union official~ who are 
constantly walking in and out or con-
ducting u-nion business by phone. If 
the intensity in this office is any indica-
tion, there has been little slo~down of 
union activity since the strike's end. 
Boyle's desk, like all of those around 
him, is piled high with pamphlets and 
papers which he shuffles through 
periodically to search for documents. 
After graduating from Pierson ·Col-
lege, Boyle worked in the Yale Univer-
sity printing service where he voted 
against Local 34 to serve as the C&T 
bargaining unit in 198~. 
But 
with 
the onset of the strike, he changed his 
mind and delved into union activity, 
eventually working on the negotiating 
committee during the strike. 

Today, Boyle hopes to recruit more 
members to the Union and to inform 
all workers of their contractual rights. 
He says the Union will try to place at 
least one steward in every department 
on campus. Consequently, if an unin-
formed employee's rights are violated, 
he or she will have quick access to 
union aid. "We want people to know
