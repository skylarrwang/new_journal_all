Arlene Seabrook with her children Shantain, Roger, and Mark .
Living wi!h a .'!lew_ of prosperity and green yards on Mansfield Street

Hurricane Gloria left New Haven with
uprooted trees and little electricity.
Every light hooked to the Yale gen-
erator functioned, but much of the city
sat in darkness, nothing but darkness
up Dixwell Avenue, blocks up into
Dixwell Plaza and parts of Elm Haven.
From her seventh-floor apartment in
an Elm Haven high-rise, Arlene Sea-
brook could hear shooting out at the
Plaza, a minor entrepreneurial fiasco
of small, always empty stores set off
from Dixwell Avenue by a bare park-
ing lot. Although her four rooms were
lit, she knew that out at the Plaza, with
the streetlights out and the stores
closed, it must be totally black. Perfect
for looters to run through and ransack
the clothing store and the fish market.
Her three children were in bed, her
mother next door, and after waking
early this morning to the violent rain,
she could finally sit down, alone. The
looting was audible, but Arlene was
more concerned with the damage the
storm had done to her own apartment.
The wind had jumbled and tossed the
few things on the small balcony outside
her living room windows. It had
broken one window pane, and who
knew when the Housing Authority
would come and fix it?

Because the Authority operates all
the subsidized housing in the New
Haven area, it probably had other
priontles in Elm Haven, perhaps
clearing out the garbage on the grate in
front of the building or fixing an
elevator in a neighboring high-rise. In
a strange way, it would be futile for the
Authority to fix Arlene's window in
October when she, like the other
tenants of 180 Canal Street, is ex-
pected to leave her apartment in
December. By 1988, the six high-rises
of the Elm Haven projects should be
empty, if the Department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD) pro-
vides necessary funding, and the 1200
high-rise inhabitants will be relocated
to two- and three-story low-rises all
over the city, living with a few other
families. The graffiti-layered walls, in-
operable elevators, and Arlene
Seabrook's balcony will be hammered
into rubble, while the city brings in
paint, tools, and blueprints to modern-
ize Elm Haven's low-rises. In several
years, the tract from Dixwell Avenue
to Canal Street, Yale to Science Park
