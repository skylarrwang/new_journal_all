religion
that
includes liberation
theology and black consciousness; in
fact, he joked that people tell him "they
hardly ever see the difference any
more" between
his sermons and
political speeches. In religious terms,
Boesak
decries the South
African
government's policy of apartheid as
heresy and blasphemy. In the words of
revolutionary politics, he calls for the
overthrow of the South African gov-
ernment. Combining both, he prays
for the government's downfall: apar-
theid, he preaches, must be irrevocably
eradicated. When he says that, he
stretches the "r's" out, sounding fiercely
certain about his conclusion.

Although religion and politics are
almost synonymou s for Boesak , he
would rather "be a pastor in a small
church somewhere" than a political
leader. Like Desmond Tutu, he feels
forced to be a leader in the opposition
movement, because all the original
political
leaders
have been -like
Nelson Mandela- imprisoned,
banned, or killed.

According to Boesak, these repressive
conditions
demand
more
than
cosmetic reform. He feels particularly
strongly
that the South African
government,
large corporations in
South Africa, and America's policy of
constructive engagement have done
nothing to end apartheid. The belief
that apartheid should be reformed,
rather than abolished, is the basis for
the Reagan administration's policy of
constructive engagement, or what is
now called "active constructive engage-
ment." But Boesak believes that apar-
theid must be ended, not just modi-
fied, so he refers to the views of people
like Thatcher and Reagan as "the soft·
legitimization of apartheid."

"In the last four or five years, the
beginning of the eighties until now, the
South African government began to
change the face of apartheid; there
were too many pressures from too
many places in the world. Their allies
in the world, notably people like Mr.
Reagan
and Mrs. Thatcher, and
others kept saying tg the South African
goverJ;'ment, 'You know we would
really like to go on supporting you, but
it is very embarrassing.' I can almost
hear Mrs. Thatcher ... " Boesak rais-
ed the pitch of his voice higher, mimick-
ing Thatcher. 'You know, Mr. Botha,
it is extremely embarrassing to be
caught on the side of naked racism in
South Africa.' Get rid of naked racism,
but hold onto the power. Be nice to
people; if you want to stab someone,
dojt nicely."


Hoesak sees ~outh Africa's new con-
stitution of 1983 as a perfect example
of the failure of international pressure
to truly push
the South African
government to abolish apartheid. The
constitution contains some reforms.
but Boesak says that it is still racist. "It
entrenches apartheid. All of the basic
laws have remained the same. It en-
trenches white minority rule. It is
based on the continuation of policies
like the homeland policy, which means
that the denationalization of black peo-
ple would continue, which means that
forced removals ·would continue. It
doesn't make any fundamental change
in our society's structures."

Boesak therefore urges nations and
companies in the West to divest from
holdings in South Africa. "But asking
for divestment isn't all one should do,"
Boesak cautioned. "There is also the
question of alterna"tive investment;
also the question of further support for


Boesak receiving an honorary degree from Yale in 1984
Considering what action to take if Yale falls to divest

our struggle in South Africa." He
hopes also that people in the United
States will use the opportunity for pro-
test that does exist in this country to
pressure · the Reagan administration
not to give diplomatic and political
support to South Africa.

Boesak said also that he would now
think much more carefully about ac-
cepting an honorary degree from Yale,
in view of the fact that the University
has. not divested. "I had hoped that by
accepting the degree, that Yale was ac-
tually tying itself to the cause that we
stand for . . . and they are not doing
that. We have to consider what kind of
action we should take if Yale should
continue to support apartheid through
their continued investments, going
against the express wishes of so large a
majority of black people in South
Africa."

"The fiery anti-apartheid leader,"
they called him. But, talking about the
deaths of his friends and the oppression
of his people, he was restrained. Once
he shook his fist in the air, then
brought it down softly to the lectern.
That absence of sound was jarring. I
expected, from his words, from the
sad, angry look in his eyes, that he
would pound the table in front of him.
I thought it misleading to call him
"fiery." It is not he and others like him
who are
setting
fire
to
South
Africa,
but the structures
;:wd
~he people who maintain apartheid.

He was arrested as he was driv-
ing to a university to try to calm, not
provoke, a student protest. But sud-
denly, he was the antagonist, he and all
other blacks there marching and pro-
testing. The real "fire" doesn't come
from those who are oppressed, but the
oppressors.

"If you have too much, you don't
understand too well ... " His words
echo. I see, again and again, that
clenched fist that didn't pound, that
taut mouth as he spoke very softly,
disturbingly, prophetically. "Every day
people are dying. I deep down cannot
believe that violence will solve the
problems, but I don't know what will
happen ... "
