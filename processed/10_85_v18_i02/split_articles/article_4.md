Greene was eventually able to portray 
a "much Inore balanced, fair, and 
healthy 
character." Unfortunately, 
Greene finds that the entertainment in-
dustry 
still portrays many black 
characters as discouragingly litnited. 
Greene has discovered that many pro-
ducers of movies and theater, lured by 
potential financial rewards, frequently 
choose to project "negative· images of 
Third World peoples." Greene has even 
producers create roles for which 
black actors simply cannot audition. 
A 
legal · educanon, 
Greene 
ex-
plained, will empower him with the 
skills necessary to defend his rights as a 
performer. "I never want to have to 
shriek and stick my head under a 
pillow when somebody says 'sl,le me.'" 
With an intimate knowledge of the 
law, Greene feels he will be able to pur-
sue his media career without submit-
ting to the discriminatory policies of 
the entertainment industry. 


The realities of embarking on a 
in the performing arts constitute 
the main theme of Greene's seminar at 
Yale. He hopes to examine with his 
students the ethical choices artists are 
sometimes forced to make when a pro-
ducer's racial, 
political, · or sexual 
beliefs are dissonant with those of the 
artist. He intends to discuss the confu-
sion a performer may experience when 
tempted by the chance of money or 
prestige 
to 
accept work 
in 
a 
psychologically damaging situation. 
Greene aspires to · instill in his students 
an uncompromising sense of artistic 
and ethical integrity, a firm base from 
which they can begin to explore their 
professional lives. 


After law school, Greene hopes to 
become a movie producer eventually 
and to continue distinguishing himself 
as an artist who will not allow profit-
inducements to threaten his 
~ntal beliefs. He concluded 
thoughtfully, "I want to stay in touch 
with the social and political values I've. 
had my whole adult life." _
