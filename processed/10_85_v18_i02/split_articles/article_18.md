The Philosophy Repressed 
Freud for Historians

When a historian concludes his analysis of an event in Woodrow Wilson's life with the words, "the vagaries of his mind are unfathomable," is he exercising commendable historical caution or giving up too soon? Should he go on to explore the links between the incident and Wilson's childhood, his feelings towards his parents, his Oedipal complex? 

In his new book, Freud for Historians, Sterling Professor of History Peter Gay argues that the use of Freudian theory can make fathomable the vagaries of Wilson's mind, as well as elucidate the passions and motivations of other historical actors, even entire historical eras. But Gay makes his case cautiously, advising his readers that psychoanalysis "is not a miracle drug or a magic password; it is an informed style of inquiry, supplying answers no one thought were available before or- even more important- suggesting questions no one had thought to ask." 

Although Freudian theory long ago filtered into the fields of literary criticism, anthropology, and sociology, historians have been slow to put it to any broad or systematic use. 
"Psychohistory," the term used to describe historiography that employs psychoanalytic concepts, has always evoked derogatory connotations: vague theories about national Oedipal complexes or the reduction of revolutions to the simple fact of somebody's repressed aggression. Yet from its earliest pages, Freud for Historians establishes itself as a sophisticated, undogmatic defense of the need for Freudian theory in historical studies. 

Gay acknowledges that some of the charges against psychohistory are valid. Past efforts to "psychoanalyze the dead" have either produced confusing descriptions of "cures" for neurotic historical figures or relied too heavily upon the absolute letter of Freudian theory. Most infuriatingly, many psychohistorians have dismissed their critics by claiming that the resistance to Freudian analysis merely proves its concepts more conclusively: critics of psychohistory are providing evidence of their own repression and resistance to cure. Gay wastes no time defending the often flawed past historical uses of psychoanalysis. Instead he bases his argument upon one simple premise: if historians are going to discuss human emotions and passions, they must proceed from a rigorous methodology and a clearly defined set of assumptions. 

Gay begins his case for psycho-history by pointing out that "the professional historian has always been a psychologist- an amateur psychologist." 

In other words, the search for explanations has always forced historians to rely upon a set of assumptions about the feelings and passions of human beings, whether or not they are aware of doing so. One historian may attribute a naval victory to "morale," another may explain the exploration of the New World as the product of "dissatisfaction" with the Old. 

In particular, Gay notes that many historians are given to using "self-interest" as the all-encompassing motive for economic and political actions, even when such actions are dressed up in the language of patriotism or philanthropy. Yet what are self-interest, greed or lack of sympathy but psychological states produced by interaction with social and cultural norms? Gay's point is that self-interest and the rhetoric that conceals self-interest do not occur at random, but are the products of specific historical conditions. Historians who describe an event as the simple product of self-interest may have settled for a facile explanation. For Gay, the use of psychoanalytic concepts provides a more systematic way to discuss motivation, going beyond common sense platitudes about human nature. 

Ironically, Gay is arguing that psychoanalysis, a methodology often described as reductionist, over-simplified, and even irrelevant, is actually more thorough than traditional historiography. 

Gay continues his defense of sophisticated psychohistory by explaining how Freudian theory explains both humanity's similarities and its cultural differences. We may all have the same sexual drive and the same aggressions, but they manifest themselves differently in different historical and cultural circumstances. Psychohistorians unreceptive to this possibility for variation and difference have missed out on the profundity of Freud and the profundity of history. Gay also points out the utility of Freud's emphasis upon irrationality in human behavior. Too often, historians looking for rational explanations of human actions forget to consider the irrational. Remembering that human beings rarely act upon clearly perceived reasons can help historians explain the mysterious and
