Talk of foi'Jivenell and unity at 88 Protrpec:t Street, Union Headquarters 
"The strike created hard feelings that have never been resolved." 
we aren't just in the office on Prospect 
Street, but in their labs as well." But 
Boyle does not acknowledge the strong 
convictions some people have against 
unions. He believes that non-union 
members are "fairly sympathetic, but 
have a laissez-faire view or are afraid 
of their bosses; it may be that this is 
their first job back in the workforce 
after having a child or that their 
husbands are against unions." 
Because Local 34 does represent all 
C&Ts, costs to print up contracts for 
non-members and to represent non-
members in grievance cases must be 
financed. The contract stipulates that 
all non-union workers hired before 
April 4, 1984 pay dues into the Con-
tract Administration Fund, and those 
hired thereafter pay directly to the 
Union. The fund is to be administered 
by one union official, one university 
official and a third selected by the first 
two. While required to relinquish por-
tions of their monthly salary, non-
union members have no voice in 
determining where their money goes. 
Many of them are irate that their par-
ticipation was never solicited, even as 
ex officio members on a board. Con-
currently, union officials like Gergen 
can't believe that non-members care so 
little about their money that they 
wouldn't consider joining the Union in 
order to control what happens to it. 
But Boyle has faith the Union will 
break through to the non-members 
once they discover that the University 
will "treat 
them 
in 
the same 
dehumanizing way as they treat the 
rest of us." 
From the union member's point of 
view, this potential for harassment, 
.nore than financial issues, is the most 
compelling reason for current non-
union members and new employees to 
join. Involved with Local 34 from its 
inception, Sammy Carr, a C&T at the 
M edical School currently working in 
the Office for Women in Medicine, 
believes that the risk of harassment on 
the j ob is too high not to have union 
support. "When people were first talk-
ing about a union, the situation with 
my boss was very good," she said. "But 
I had seen so many bad things around 
m e that I had to support the idea of a 
union. You just can't tell when things 
might go b~d." 
Lowering her voice, Carr began her 
own story. She explained that relations 
with her boss, a doctor, remained good 
until the strike began. O nce she was 
out on the picket line, however, all 
changed. "I would call him, and he 
would say how concerned he was," 
Carr explained, "But not once would 
that man come out simply to have a 
cup of coffee and talk." When Carr 
returned to work, she claims that her 
boss and the business manager tried "to 
make life hell." One day her boss 
presented three serious accusations 
against her in front of the business 
manager, the assistant manager, a co-
worker, and a paid union represen-
tative. Of the. three accusations, the 
most extreme a-nd, Perhaps the most 
absurd, was that Carr had been 
responsible for, in her words, "killing 
nine babies." 
Well, Carr did not kill any babies. 
Nine women, however, were placed on 
a list as having positive results from 
pregnancy tests when, actually, their 
results had been negative. The mistake

occurred when Carr was reading 
results over the phone to an employee 
at the Women's Center, and the word 
•negative" was never heard. Only three 
of the nine women were actually given 
incorrect results before the error was 
caught, yet Carr's boss considered the 
matter serious enough to warrant 
discipline and possible dismissal. Carr 
filed a grievance challenging these ac-
cusations but said that the matter was 
dropped when she began pressuring 
her boss to present his case in a 
meeting with a union steward. Since 
then Carr has transferred depart-
ments, happy now with her new job 
and working environment. 
Although Carr admits that her case 
is unusual, she adamantly defends the 
need for a strong union as a protector 
of all Yale '. C&Ts. Recent demonstra-
tions, rallies, and a large membership 
meeting in BatteU Chapel are part of a 
campaign to increase Local 34's 
visibility and viability. But if the 
Union is to function as the legitimate 
voice for the C&T workforce, it must 
first win the confidence and en-
thusiasm of the large body of non-
members before successfully challeng-
ing the University on issues like 
harassment and respect. Yet with or 
without total support, Local 34 never-
theless will continue to dispute the 
University concerning grievance_s, 
both personaJ and general. T he con-
tract has done little to convince the 
Union of any good intentions on the 
University's part. The administration, 
however, believes the contract will 
eventually cure all, making subsequent 
Union demands and complaints in-
valid. The contract, of course, could 
not have been expected to erase 
memory nor defuse the inherent con-
flicts between labor and management. 
T he disagreements between Local 34 
and Yale, and among the C&Ts 
themselves, neither began nor ended 
last winter. Perhaps the three-month-
long strike was just the prelude.
