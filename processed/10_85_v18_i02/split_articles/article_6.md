lingual education program. Yet the, 
future of bilingual education may be 
threatened by the Reagan Administra· 
tion's new policies. 


Speaking on September 26 about 
bilingual education, Education 
Secretary William Bennett declared 
that the programs ha.ve failed to bring 
pupils into 
the English-speaking 
mainstream. 
The New 
York 
Times 
quoted him as saying, "After $1.7' 
billion of federal funds we have no 
evidence that children we sought to 
, help- that the children who deserve 
our help-have benefiteCl.". His opin· 
ion is supported by the negative results 
of many studies conducted on bilingual 
education in recent years. 


These 
showed that English isn't being taught 
quickly enough and that valuable time 
is being lost in regular classroom in· ·
struction. 


Despite past findings, however, new 
research by Yale psycholinguist Dr. 
Kenji Hakuta refutes Bennett'sclaims. 
According to Hakuta, children in bi- 
lingual programs not only keep up 
with their English-speaking peers, bu 
may in fact excel them in some areas. 
"Children who 
have 
developed 
strong skills in their native languag~ 
will transfer these abilities to English,: 
Hakuta said, disputing the "lost-time 
argument. Children taught in a bi- 
lingual setting also develop a greate~ 
understanding of the mechanics an~ 
structure of language. Furthermore, 
Hakuta has found that a bilingual child 
displays superior cognitive abilities in 
reading skills and non-verbal logic. 


His findings also undermine 
th~ 
main tenets of an approach to bilingu~ 
education known as the "immersion 
technique, 
in which non-English 
speaking students are immediately 
placed in an all-English classroom. Io 
the past, advocates of immersion have 
argued that it is the most successful 
and least expensive of bilingual tech- 
niques. But. the most common ap-
proach has been the "transitional" pro-
gram, in which students keep up with 
the reading, math, and other subject! 
in their native tongues, while learning 
enough English to enter the regul~ 
classroom. The transitional program 1! 
successful enough that students whO 
enter the program in kindergarten 
usually will be transferred to the 


regular classroom within two years. 
Yet many evaluations of the tran· 
'i!jonal method are conducted in the 
fourth grade, on those children who 
never left the program and are still 
learning in two languages. Critics 
point to the remaining fourth graders 
aa a sign of bilingual education's 
failure, when, in fact, they are most 
likely to be slow learners in any 
language. 


Hakuta suggests an alternative to 
both these programs and is working for 
ita implementation in New Haven 
schools like Hill Central. In what is 
called the "two-way" program, the 
clauroom consists of half native-
speakers and half English-speakers. All 
children begin learning in Spanish and 
are later introduced to English. T he 
-~panish-speaker . benefits from a bi-
hngual program, and the English 
speaking child is exposed to a second 


Yet because of Washington's new 
position, such federally-funded pilot 
Programs may have trouble procuring 
funds. Bennett has called for the 
d~~gulation of bilingual education, 
gavang local 
school districts the 
autonomy to determine how the pro-
~~ are run. Many advocates of 
bahng u a l education feel that 
Washington is trying to saddle the 
states and cities with a responsibility 
that locals themselves do not want. 


This year, the government funded 
only two cities for the two-way pro-
gt'aln, and New 'Haven was fourth on 
the .list. Perhaps New Haven will 
~ve the necessary funds to initiate 
dou
e program next year. But Hakuta is 
btful. "If New Haven doesn't 
receive funds from the feds, I believe 
we will take a grass roots approach and 
801Dehow fund it on a local level. 
Hawever, without the federal govern-
ment's support for new and innovative 
f i'Ograms such as the two-way one, a 
tt of locaJ authorities will shy away 
rom them. I believe that Washington's 
~are 
just a smokescreen for term-
l~g minority programs, which are 
t orna
1. 
in the side of conservative 
po atica."
