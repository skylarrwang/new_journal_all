Lisa in the Sound: no schools, just squid 
Whale's Tale 
Welcomed by a string of expletives 
from Yale medical student David 
Cromwell and by the frantic screams of 
his_ sailing pat:tner, a 
13-foot-long 
Beluga whale em!::rged late last July in 
the Long Island Sound, just ofi the . 
coast of New Haven. Barely missing the 
starboard side of their Laser sailboat 
and soaking the two with her spray, the 
pearly white whale followed them for 
the next 500 yards as they tried to 
escape. 


Cromwell quickly realized, 
however, that trying to outmaneuver 
the whale was unwise and, as the whale 
became 
rnor.e playful, unnecessary. 
N ow , two months later, the whale still 
swims along the Connecticut coastline 
appearing anywhere between Darien 
and N ew H aven on a given day. The 
creature, named Lisa for the Long 
Island Sound America organization, is 
as harmless as the small fish on which 
she has fed in the New Haven harbor 
for the past seven months. Photographs 
of Lisa 
swimming alongside small 
children prove her gentleness. But her 
unique situation, living without other 
whales and surrounded by humans, 
could threaten her survival. 


]}ecause whales usually travel in 
schools, observers at the Long Island 
Sound Task Force worried at first that 
Lisa was sick or injured. But apparent-
ly 
Lisa has returned, if only by 
herself, to a familiar region. The 
Sound, which includes New Haven 
harbor , had been home to large 
schools of Belugas. The increasing 
temperature and pollution content of 
the water, however, drove them away 
to fresher waters, particularly the St. 
Lawrence Strait. As their new homes 
became over-populated, many whales 
were forced to leave. According to 
marine biologists, the high squid con-
tent of the Sound probably attracted 
Lisa to this area over others. 


Lisa's continued solitude and emo-
tion~] state, though, remain a mystery. 
"We can't really say if she's lonely, but 
she's normal," said marine biologist 
David Merritt from 
Connecticut's 
Mystic Seaport. "And since she's acting 
normally, chances are she's happy." . 


Only boats and the people in them 
threaten Lisa. 
"People might be 
unaware of her existence and harm her 
out of fright, or some real macho sailor 
could try to harpoon her to ·show his 
friends," Merritt explained. 


While 
concerned about Lisa, Merritt is quick 
to deny that abrasions seen on Lisa's 
skin were caused by the old entertain-
ment, now illegal, of hooking large fish 
to tnotorboat lines and dragging them 
for miles. Abrasions like Lisa's mark 
all Belugas' soft skin from contact with 
the ocean's rough surfaces. Merritt 
continued that, contrary · to current 
rumor, Mystic Seaport has no inten-
tion of taking Lisa in since she is too 
old to accept a life of relative confine-
ment. 


Left alone, Lisa should remain in 
good health. Each day in the Sound 
further enables her to survive there. 
"It's like an abandoned dog who }:ta~ t_o 
get 'street smart' to live," Merritt said. 
Because of Lisa's ready adaption, and 
because she has not been plagued with 
any of the possible dangers, t1'!e &_o_und 
once again houses majestic wildlife-
even if only a lone whale.
