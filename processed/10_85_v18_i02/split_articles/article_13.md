"How long, how long, 
does it take for people 
to begin to 
understand?" 
This time, the story wasn't about a 
stranger. A month before his arrest, I 
had met Boesak at a theology con-
ference in Stony Point, a small town in 
upstate New York. 
Although the 
newspapers later called him the "fiery 
anti-apartheid leader," the small, trim 
man 
with 
wire-rimmed 
glasses 
who appeared at the conference wear-
ing a conservative gray pin-striped suit 
could not have been less threatening. 
The man who a 
South African 
newspaper had referred to as the "most 
dangerous man in South Africa" sat 
waiting to speak, looking down at his 
hands, a little startled and embarrassed 
when someone introduced him as a 
man who has "taken a role in history." 
He spoke with a soft, lilting voice that 
becomes high-pitched when moved or 
trying to move others. 
"And when I come to the United 
States, and I say, yes- I believe in 
non-violence, they give me standing 
ovations, but what in God's name does 
it help us?" Boesak asked. "I am a little 
upset today, because I have heard, just 
before I started to speak, that once 
again ... two people have been killed, 
and one of them a 12-year-old boy. 
How long, how long does it take for 
J>eople to begin to understand?" . 
He looked around the room, at 
everyone who'd been watching him so 
intently, breathing with the cadence of 
his words. He waited, letting the un-
comfortable silence hang in the air for 
a moment. Then he continued, look-
ing at each of us. "I just get so angry at 
people who are so glib about violence 
and non-violence; I get so angry at 
people who are self-righteous about 
that issue; I get so angry at people who 
have the instruments of non-violent 
pressure that could end the violence at 
their disposal and they refuse to use 
them." 

Accustomed to the rights to speak 
freely and 
protest 
peaceably, 
Americans forget, Boesak said, •hat 
"the conditions required for a pc .. u .. eful 
resistance in South Africa arc simply 
not there . . . Simply not there as they 
have been in the United States for the 
civil rights problems with Martin 
Luther King." 

The prospects for successful non-
violent resistance seem slim, 
said 
Boesak, if one examines the last 
decades of history in South Africa. 
That history includes such incidents as 
Sharpeville, when in 1960, 69 people 
were killed for demonstrating peaceful-
ly against the pass-Jaws; Soweto, in 
J 976, 
when 
hundreds of school 
children were killed for protesting the 
unequal educational system. "In J 976, 
the government so openly, so ruthless-
ly, showed its intention that nothing, 
but literally nothing would stand in its 
way of executing the policies to which 
it had dedicated itself," Boesak said, 
the corners of his mouth tightening, 
squeezing out the word "nothing." 
"Nothing would stand in its way to 
maintain apartheid and 
therefore 
maintain the oppression and the over-
privileged economic, social and poli-
tical position of white South Africa. 
And so we came to understand that 
even the lives of children were not 
sacred in this regard." 

Later, on August 27, the day before 
Boesak's planned march 
to 
the 
Pollsmoor Prison where African Na-
tional 
Congress leader Nelson 
J\.1andela has been held for more than 
21J years, I excitedly turned on the 
radio and TV several times to hear 
about the planning of the march. By 
that evening, Boesak had been ar-
rested; the next day South African 
police broke up what remained of the 
march with whips, tear gas, attack 
dogs and rubber bullets. My comfor-
table anticipation followed by the reali-
ty of violence reminded me of Boesak's 
words about American "standing ova-
tions" and the difference in our coun-
tries. It's easy for us to cheer for non-
violent resistance with an ocean's 
distance to dilute the blood. 

Although he has now been released 
after nearly a month of solitary con-
finement, Allan Boesak is still not free. 
Today he can no longer speak at 
theology conferences in little towns in 
the United States-or anywhere else. 
He has turned in his passport, cannot 
address more than 10 people at a time, 
cannot speak to journalists, must 
report to the police every morning, 
must stay in his home at night. He 
faces up to 25 years imprisonment on 
each of three counts of "political 
subversion"- for 
advocating

divestiture to Western nations, calling 
for school and economic boycotts, and 
. praying for the downfall of the South 
African government, just as he did at 
the conference in upstate New York. 

While in New York, he had said that 
he was lucky, that his position awarded 
him some protection, that he really had 
many more rights than most black or 
coloured South Africans. Now, that no 
longer matters. As he put it, "the South 
African government can do whatever it 
wants to me," as it has to so many 
before. 

Boesak has not only had to confront 
the oppressive nature of his nation's 
government, but also the racism of his 
own Dutch Reformed Church. That 
church historically has been a defender 
of apartheid; in fact, Boesak says that 
the roots of apartheid "lay in the bosom 
of the Dutch Reformed Church." 

What happens to people who are 
black-or "coloured"- in South Africa 
who decide to devote their lives to a 
church they have discovered to be 
racist? Jim Ellis, a friend who knew 
Boesak when he was first studying 
theology, 
told this story. 
He 
remembered 
that during 
Boesak's 
theological training, the two of them, 
along with some other friends from the

university, often spent Sunday after-
noons at a nearby women's teacher 
training college. When Boesak was or-
dained as 
a 
mtmster, 
he began 
preaching in that same small town near 
Cape Town. An old lady in that town 
used to feed the friends Sunday meals. 
One Sunday, she said to him: "You 
know, you preached a beautiful ser-
mon today, but I just got a letter say-
ing that I am a disqualified person in 
my own home. My own home that I 
have lived in all my life with my hus-
band, who's now dead and where I've-
raised all my children, and now I've 
got to leave. I've got to start all over 
again. How can I do that? Where am I 
going to go?" And she asked him, 
"Doesn't the Lord who you preached 
about so beautifully have anything to 
say about this kind of condition?" 

"I think that question that day, more 
than anything else, sent Allan on the 
course that he has followed ever since 
proclaiming that this vicious system in 
South Africa is . . . a heresy," conclud-
ed Ellis, now a professor at ~he Univer-
sity of Western Cape. 

For his 
religion 
to have any 
relevance in the world, Boesak decided 
the answer to the old woman's question 
must be, "Yes, the Lord does have 
something to say about this situation." 

"We discovered," Boesak said, widen-
ing his eyes in warning, pushing the 
words out of his tightened mouth, "that 
there is no way that we could stay out 
of the struggle, out of the active struggle 
for liberation." 

"The Bible is written by people who 
live, by definition, on the underside of 
history," 
Boesak said, explaining 
liberation theology. "That's why people 
who have too much don't understand 
too well what it says." He paused, look-
ing down for a moment. As he began 
to talk again, he almost whispered. 
"We were too afraid, too influenced by 
a Western privileged understanding of 
the Bible to understand the message of 
gospel. 
But when liberation 
theology came . . . " 

Boesak's voice became higher and 
higher. "We began to see how exciting 
a book the Bible really is, and how 
much dynamite it is under any op-
pressive structure in the world. Des-
mond Tutu is fond of saying that the 
government goes 
around banning every book that it 
thinks 
is 
too radical 
for 
us 
read- Karl Marx and whoever else 
those people might be," Boesak said, 
waving them aside with a hand in the 
air. "He says that what they never 
understood was that the dangerous 
book for black people to read in South 
Africa is the Bible; that's the book they 
$hould have banned. And they never 
did." 

Boesak explained that the Bible is 
revolutionary because to call Jesus 
Christ "'Lord of Lords" is to deny the 
authority of any unjust government. 
"Jesus Christ was calJed Lord, and he 
was executed as a rebel by the Roman 
government," Boesak said. "So because 
of this, 
political engagement is 
something that you do, not in spite of 
your discipleship of Jesus Christ, but 
as an integral part of it. You have no 
choice." 

In South Africa, being black or col-
oured means that you live on what 
Boesak called, in explaining liberation 
theology, "the underside of history." 
Because of this, the conclusions of 
liberation theology and the black con-
sciousness movement are intimately 
connected. Before he came to his 
radical understanding of the gospel, 
Boesak had been caught in what he 
called "the schizophrenia of in-
betweeness." 

"When you are born a coloured in 
South Africa," Boesak remembered, 
"you live with a perpetual mixed feel-
ing toward God. Because you would 
every now and then say to God, why in 
the world didn't you go a little bit fur-
ther and make me white? You came so 
close; wouldn't it have been much 
easier for all of us concerned? But 
then, of course, you look at other peo-
ple, and you say oh, well thank God, 
He didn't make me black." He spoke 
quickly, running his words together, a 
lifetime of conflicting emotion in one 
breath. "Really, you never knew where 
you belonged, or where you wanted to 
belong, or whether you would be 
welcomed by this group or by the other

lll 

group. They make you understand 
through the laws that everywhere you 
don't really belong anywhere." 

"Black consciousness," Boesak said, 
"changed all of that. All of that. That 
nonsense of not knowing where do I 
belong and what is my identity we 
threw out the window. First of all, we 
looked at ourselves, and said, black 
people, we have got to make up our 
own minds about what this situation is. 
We can no longer depend on the 
analysis of white people, however good 
and well-intentioned they may be. We 
have got to understand our own suffer-
ing in our own way." 

"The second thing we came to 
understand was that black con-
sciousness meant that we don't have to 
make excuses anymore because we 
were there . . . we weren't going to 
say, well, I'm sorry that God didn't 
make me white-Forget that! I am a per-
son, I am a human being, and nobody 
in this world is ever going to tell me 
any different from now on. In a coun-
try where racism is legitimized, is in-
stitutionalized ... is the very basis of 
the law, the very fabric of our society 
and our economic and social life . .. it 
was an incredible awareness for black 
people to no longer make excuses to 
white people, and most importantly, to 
ourselves, that we were black." 

"Now," Boesak said of black con-
sciousness, "that's very threatening to 
white people. Very threatening to 
white people when they're not so sure 
of their own position anyway, when 
they know they've had everything in 
life except peace of mind and the 
future." 

Boesak doesn't distinguish between 
politics in South Africa 
and the
