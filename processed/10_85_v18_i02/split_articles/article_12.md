Revolutionary Gospel 
Pam Thompson 
August 27, 1985, 1:30 p.m., Cape 
Town, 
South Africa. 
Dr. 
Allan 
Boesak, president of the World Coun-
cil of Reformed Churches and a 
founder of the United Democratic 
Front (UDF) was "detained" today by 
the South African police under the In-
ternal Security Act. This act allows 
anyone to be detained by order of any 
senior police officer and held in-
definitely without warrant and bail. At 
a church meeting earlier this morning, 
Boesak received notice of student and 
police clashes at the University of 
Western Cape, where he is chaplain. 
He decided to go to the university to 
try to calm the students. On his way, 
Boesak was stopped by police at a 
roadblock. Three minutes later, two 
plainclothes policemen took Allan 
Boesak away. 
Just a 
week before this arrest, 
Boesak had issued a statement in 
response to allegations by Louis le 
Grange, the minister of Law and 
Order, that he was using his clerical 
robe as "battle dres~": "The minister 
18 The New J ournaVOctober II, 1985 
must not impose his violent , 
militaristic thinking upon me. I have 
marched in the face of his armed 
police, not with guns ... but with my 
Bible-my faith in Jesus Christ and 
my people's determination to be free. I 
will do so again. . . . My resistance to 
apartheid is based upon my calling and 
faith as a Christian. No powers on 
earth, including the awesome powers 
at the minister's disposal, will stop me 
from doing my duty." 
In the Cape province of South Africa, 
Allan Boesak was born a "coloured," a 
person of mixed race. He grew up in a 
very poor family, his mother caring for 
him and his six brothers and sisters 
after the death of their father. When he 
decided to become a min.ister, he was 
given his theological education by the 
"coloured" part of the Dutch Reformed 
Church. After receiving his doctorate 
in theology in The Netherlands, he 
came back to South Africa amidst the 
unrest of the late seventies. He became 
a world-respected theologian; as Presi-
dent of the World Council of Re-
formed Churches, he represents 17 
million Christians world wide. 
Even 
Yale recognized Boesak's achievements 
by awarding him an honorary Doctor 
of Divinity degree in 1984. 
Despite his degrees and his posi-
tions, Boesak's theology is one that 
challenges, rather than affirms the ex-
isting power structures of the world. 
His radical theology of liberation sees 
no separation between religion and the 
political, revolutionary struggle for 
justice in the world. For that reason, 
Boesak helped found the UDF, an 
anti-apartheid, 
non-racial umbrella 
organization composed of various 
church groups, labor unions and stu-
dent organizations. His life, he says, 
"is in the hands of God," to be used for 
the struggle against apartheid in South 
Africa. 
For me, that newspaper article an-
nouncing Boesak's arrest violated the 
safe boundaries of newsprint, the 
boundaries with ourselves on one side, 
the people in the news on the other.
