Bridging the Gap? 
Melissa Turner 
and Jay Carney 
Not since last fall had students seen 
workers gathered on High Street. Yet 
on September 11, 1985, 40 people, 
mostly 
women , 
mostly Sterling 
Library workers, all Local 34 members 
and sympathizers came together for a 
lunchtime rally on the walkway in 
front of Sterling. Black ribbons and 
Union buttons displayed on breast 
pockets distinguished the ralliers from 
passers-by and curious bystanders. 

Quickly, light conversations dissipated 
as enthusiastic but often hostile cheer-
ing began. Reaching into brown paper 
bags for sandwiches, 
protestors 
listened while several of their co-
workers spoke about personal 
grievances with library management.

For such 
a 
small 
crowd,the 
at-
mosphere 
was unusually volatile. 

Pauses from the speaker often brought 
wild clapping and shouts from the 
periphery about "the library regime." 
"They don't treat us like humans!" 
someone yelled. "We have to protect 
the precious few freedoms we still 
have." Half an hour later lunch was 
over, and the workers began filing 
back into the library. 

A year ago union rallies were a 
familiar sight at Yale. After Local 34's 
emotionally charged and divisive 
14-week strike, the Union and the 
University apparently bridged their 
differences last January by signing a 
new contract. But now, nine months 
later, "harrassment" and "unfair treat· 
ment" are accusations that the Univer· 
sity's clerical and technical (C&T) 
workers aim at management and, oc· 
casionally, at each other. As workers 
and management try to build an eiTec· 
tive relationship based on the new con· 
tract, many find that the whole ex· 
perience of the strike has failed to in· 
crease mutual understanding and 
respect. Instead, resentment from the 
strike persists, infecting each side's in· 
terpretation of the contract. Conse· 
quently the familiar scenarios of Union 
protest and administrative reticence 
have surfaced once more. 

Both the Union and the University 
seem pleased with the contract, which
