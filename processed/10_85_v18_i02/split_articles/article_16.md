will be transformed into a mixed-
income neighborhood, with houses 
and apartments, a variety of residents, 
ample parking, and safety. 
Ironically, most of Elm Haven was 
built in 1940 as an escape from the 
city's slums, housing for those dis-
placed by the construction of the Oak 
Street connector. But in 45 years, 
everything has 
moved 
perversely 
backward. The brainchild of New 
Haven and HUD reminds anyone 
walking down Henry Street of the 
crumbling of the city's neighborhoods 
and of the staggering number of im-
poverished citizens in this town. The 
1980 census provided the hard num-
bers that drove home the effects of 
years of deterioration: 25.2 percent of 
the population lives below the poverty 
line, making New Haven the seventh 
poorest city in the nation. And Elm 
Haven is the poorest section of one of 
America's poorest cities. Now, the 
Housing Authority has returned to 
HUD, asking $40 to $50 million to 
fund the renovation of the neigh-
borhood. 

Yet more than age and weather con-
tributed to the fraying of Elm Haven; 
mere wear-and-tear doesn't necessitate 
demolition. But jobs and revenues 
have drained .away from the city into 
the suburbs and the Sun Belt, educa-
tion has declined, and indifference 
may have set in downtown. Many who 
left Elm Haven left it entirely, forget-
ting their old apartments and neigh-
bors. Others, like Arlene Seabrook, 
are still waiting to leave a place they 
have never called home. 

"When I was little, me and some 
friends would ride our bikes past here, 
and I used to say 'I never want to live 
there," Arlene said. Perhaps she rode 
her bike down Henry Street, three 
blocks in from Dixwell, and saw the 
apartment building that she would 
move into years later. The road in 
front of her high-rise, Canal Street, 
seems more like a long driveway, in-
significant in comparison to the now-
rejuvenated Olin Chemical complex 
across from it, low tan buildings sur-
rounded by a high link fence and 
barbed wire, one corner of Science 
Park. From Arlene's living room win-
dows, she can see one long, white 
building of the U.S. Repeating Arms 
factory, a company that had employed 
many first generation Elm Haven 
tenants right after World War II. 

Sitting in the living room the day 
after the storm, Arlene still kept the 
shades drawn, leaving the room cool 
and dim. A thick, dark rust rug, beige 
H erculon sofas melt into the shadows, 
but the frames on her walls and the 
portraits of herself and her children are 
brightly colored- orange sunset back-
drops, 
blue vests, crisp white 
babyclothes. Arlene's two sons, Mark, 
10, and Roger, five, abandoned watch-
ing Popeye in the living room and 
played in an adjacent bedroom. She sat 
on the coffee table, and across from her 
on the sofa sat her two-year-old 
daughter Shantain, reaching out and 
offering her mother a sock. With her 
full face and broad smile, Arlene 
doesn't look very different from a pic-
ture on the wall taken of her in high 
school. 

In 1966, when Arlene was eight, she 
and her mother, Mary Seabrook, came 
north to Connecticut from their family 
home in South Carolina, part of a se-
cond wave of residents for once-
middle-class neighborhoods like the 
Hill, Fair Haven, and Elm Haven 
after many of the post-World War II 
generation had 
educated their 
children, 
retired , 
and 
elsewhere. Arlene's own three children 
are growing up in New Haven know-
ing little of their mother's ties down 
South. The South is home. Buford, 
South Carolina, right next to Parris 
Island. Most of her family still lives 
there, in brick houses or trailer homes, 
situated on their own land. Some tried 
life in Connecticut, but all except 
Arlene and her mother have left the 
state. In fact, when Mary and Arlene-
first moved to Connecticut, they lived 
with Mary's sister in Stamford. Mary 
believed she could find well-paying 
jobs here, but ended up taking laundry 
and domestic work. After nine months 
at her sister's, Mary came to New 
Haven with her daughter. 

The house they lived in with six 
other families on the Hill, at 724 Con-
gress Avenue, has since been con-
demned, but while Arlene grew up 
there, she was surrounded by one large 
family knit from the seven. She had 
places to play outside, a yard. Still, her 
mother could not find decent work in 
New Haven, and so went back South 
in 197 4. She lived there for eight 
months, and she would have remained 
had she not been diagnosed as having 
hypertension. She returned to Connec-
ticut for treatment, and because of the 
medical care, decided to stay. Because 
her doctors pressured the Housing 
Authority, Mary received a subsidized 
apartment in Elm Haven that same 
year. "My mother wanted me to come 
with her, but I cried when she told me 
we were moving to the projects," 
Arlene said, as she picked up her 
children's hairbrush from the coffee 
table. "None of my friends lived here. 
Today, you live with people for 12 
years, and they just aren't friendly. 
They're not together. Everybody is 
against everybody." 

After years on the same floor, in the 
same rooms, Arlene calls Elm Haven 
"the 
projects" with 
a 
scorn 
restlessness compounded by her view 
of Mansfield Street and its tidy homes 
and lawns. But in the forties and fif-
ties, Elm Haven differed little from the 
middle-class neighborhoods at its 
borders. John Daniels, whose parents 
moved there after the War, remembers 
blocks without the high-rises later built 
in 1955, tenants who were proud of 
their apartments, and a city that main-
tained its public housing. Because 
most families had two paychecks com-
ing in from the same few companies, 
everyone was in the same economic 
class. Back then it was a neighborhood. 

Later, Daniels went to school, left Elm 
Haven, and eventually was elected in

1979 to represent the district that in-
cludes Elm Haven in the Connecticut 
State Senate. 

Daniels believes the changes in Elm 
Haven came as population swelled and 
jobs disappeared in the late sixties and 
early seventies. Like Mary Seabrook, 
many rural, unskilled blacks from the 
South migrated north searching for a 
better life. But the heavy industry that 
once thrived in New Haven and hired 
the unskilled had either left the city or 
simply died. "There were no jobs, so 
many of them were on public assis-
tance," Daniels explained. "They lived 
in public housing, but there were cuts 
in the 
city's services and, 
sim-
ulaneously, high taxes. But Dixwell 
was no 'longer a priority for the city; 
most felt it was a burden. Elm Haven 
had no political clout- the people 
weren't taxpayers." 

The frustration of the unemployed, 
storms, bitter winters, and time con-
stantly added new scars to Elm Haven. 
When Arlene moved in 11 years ago, 
however, Elm Haven still had mail-
boxes in every building, laundry 
rooms, and doors that locked. Now, 
washers and dryers are four blocks 
away at a Dixwell Avenue laundromat, 
and all the mailboxes are in one 
building, open only from nine a.m. to 
four p.m. The dirt and disrepair which 
Arlene passed by everyday, and the 
complaints of individuals about living 
conditions received little attention. 
Then, .in 
December 
1981, 
many 
tenants m the high-rises had problems 
with their heating and hot water; either 
they had none at all or far too much. It 
had happened every winter, but this 
time, a group of tenants took their 
complaint to 
New 
Haven 
Legal 
Assistance, not the Housing Authori-
ty. With the help of Legal Assistance, 
the residents formed the Elm Haven 
Tenants Association and filed a class 
action suit against the Authority, 
'demanding immediate repairs to their 
buildings. The Court ruled in favor of 
the tenants, and the Authority then 
petitioned HUD for two million dollars 
to install new boilers. 

By this time, both tenants and the 
Authority realized that much of Elm 
Haven had become uninhabitable, 
even unsalvageable. Therefore, the 
Authority worked closely with the 
tenants' group for two years, and in 
December 1983, released the Elm 
Haven Design Charette, a report 
which sought to ch'ange dramatically 
the living situation of the tenants. 

Whatever improvements had been 
made over the years were only tem-
porary, merely delaying the rampant 
deterioration. As a long-term solution 
to the problems of Elm Haven, the 
Charette report proposed that HUD 
fund the destruction of the high-rises, 
the renovation of the low-rises and the 
construction of more low-rise apart-
ments in the neighborhood. 

The money from HUD will go not 
only to the redevelopment of Elm 
Haven, but to the building of low-rises 
around the city. For years bureaucrats 
and social scientists relied on large-
scale projects to house the poor. But 
acre upon acre of run-down buildings 
only convinced tenants that they lived 
in a ghetto. And what does it matter to 
break a window or write on the walls if 
you live in a ghetto? Realizing the 
anger and hopelessness that they had 
piled into 10 stories, the Authority ad-
vocated in the Charette report the scat-
tered site housing approach, by which 
one to four families live together in 
low-rises in middle-class neighbor-
hoods. Although the new maneuver 
will not eradicate poverty, it will, the 
Authority claims, improve the lives of

New H aven's poor. "Tearing down the 
high-rises will have a great impact on 
the families of Elm Haven," said Linda 
Evans, executive director of the New 
Haven Housing Authority. "They will 
have hope for the future; they will 
begin planning things again. They will 
look for jobs, buy furniture. Their 
children will be going to better schools. 
Right now, no one knows oppor-
tunity." 

Expected to 
move soon, Mary 
Seabrook received a list of five possible 
new homes, none of which, unfor-
tunately, appealed to her. Arlene wor-
ries that may happen to her as well. 
M ostly, she wants a place where her 
children can play outside and feel safe, 
as she had felt while living on the Hill 
and earlier, in South Carolina. "Here, 
they stay in that room," Arlene said, 
pointing with the hairbrush at the 
bedroom behind her. "I won't let them 
go out around here." 

"What if something happened to 
them out there? I live too high up. 
What can I do? By the time I get there, 
they'll be messed up, or dead, or gone." 
Arlene 
shook 
her 
head sternly. 
"They're not old enough to go out. 
They don't go out unless I do." 

"One time, I sent M a rk to the 
grocery store on the corner," Arlene 
recalled. "He was robbed by two little 
boys. They took his ice cream and his 
money. H e's a quiet kid, other kids like 
to pick on him. If I'd ever caught up 
with those kids ... " She half-jokingly 
made a tight fist and shook it. 

If Mark and Roger don't return 
home from school by 2:40 p.m. every 
day, Arlene goes and looks for them. 
From early morning until they go to 
sleep at 9 p.m., the children are 
Arlene's sole concern, perhaps because 
both her sons are sickly, Roger with 
asthma and Mark with kidney prob-
lems. Although Mark is the oldest of 
her children, Arlene worries more 
about him than the others. When he 
was five days old, Mary felt his 
stomach an.d discovered it was very 
hard. Arlene took him to the hospital 
and found that he needed one of his 
kidneys removed. For three and a half 
years, she shuttled her son to and from 
the hospital every few weeks. 

If she were sure daycare or baby-
sitters would adequately care for her

the poorest of the 
poor to survive? They 
think that by putting 
new windows there 
(Elm Haven), they're 
making things better." 
children, Arlene would more actively 
look for a job. But she becomes very 
uneasy at the thought of leaving her 
children with other people, imagining 
herself at work looking at her watch 
every few minutes, hoping to leave and 
check up on her kids. She waits instead 
for Shantain to grow old enough for 
school so she can look for work once 
more. "If I had money now, I'd let 
them do things," she said. "But I don't 
have money. If my child wants to play 
an instrument, he can't. If it isn't free, 
we can't do it. 

"Through all this, I feel good. Some 
people are millionaires, but they don't 
have kids. I have nothing, but I have 
my kids. And I tell them, 'There's 
always going to be momma when there 
isn't daddy.' My momma did fine. 
None of her kids are alcoholics or drug 
addicts. I want to tell her , 'Praise 
yourself, lady. You did good with your 
kids."' 

Arlene gave birth to Mark when she 
was 17, a junior at Lee High School. 
Her pregnancy forced her to ask 
herself what she should do, until her 
mother simply told her to have the 
baby. She left Lee for a year and went 
to the Polly T . McCabe Center, a 
school 
for 
pregnant teenagers. 

Although Arlene and Mark lived at 
home, Mark's father gave them finan-
cial support for a short while. Finally, 
Mark's father demanded Arlene spend 
all her time just with him, and after 
many fights, they broke up. Five years 
later, when she was pregnant with 
Roger by a different man, Arlene con-
sidered having an abortion. "But 
I realized that the baby didn't ask to 
come here. So why kill it?" she said. "I 
took care of my first child, and I would 
take care of this one, I thought.'' 

Although her sons were unplanned, 
Arlene wanted to have Shantain, 
whose father she had been dating for 
five years and who wanted to m arry 
her. But when he became zealously 
.religious, she broke the engagement. 

To much of the white, middle class, 
is just another "welfare 
mother," having kids so she won't have 
to work. She is so acutely aware of the 
labels attached to her, and how they 
would disappear if she were a white 
woman. "I hear on Phil Donahue that 
people don't like us state people 
because we're this or that. But how can
