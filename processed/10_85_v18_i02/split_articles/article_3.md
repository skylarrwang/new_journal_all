Out of this World 
For his masterwork In a Goldfish Bowl, 
artist Lindbergh van Gogh bought a 
Volkswagen Beetle, removed the roof, 
and filled the interior with water. The 
bold young artist then pushed the vehi-
cle in front of a local newspaper office. 
After painting himself yellow, he sat 
inside, breathing through scuba equip-
ment. 
"What was I saying?" Van Gogh 
said. "We live in a fish bowl, and the 
newspapers look at us." 
Van Gogh is a creation of writer 
Leith Johnson of The Planet, a new 
monthly arts and entertainment 
publication based in Hamden. Like 
van Gogh, The Planet seeks to produce 
artwork that is innovative and ex-
citing, if somewhat bizarre. Unlike the 
newspapers van Gogh portrays, The 
Planet does not follow the people in a 
goldfish bowl. Therefore, 
the 
publication's motto is 
"No news is 
good news."Â· 
The 
Planet 
was 
founded 
last 
November by a group of graphic 
designers and artists who had recently 
graduated from the University of Con-
necticut. "We got good jobs, and we 
liked what we were doing, but we 
wanted to do something a little bit 
crazy," said Gunnar Johnson, the 
newspaper's editor and 
publisher. 
When he produced his first issue this 
past June, Johnson hoped The Planet 
would become "a vehicle for all the 
starving artists in 
New Haven." 
Because it received little reaction from 
potential writers and artists, however, 
the publication evolved over its next 
three issues into an entertainment 
newspaper featuring the writing and 
artwork of its 10-member staff. Each 
issue centers on a theme, such as July's 
"Vacation" or September's "Back to 
School." J ohnson now 
distributes 
2,500 
free 
copies of each 
issue 
throughout the New Haven area. 
Stories in The Planet range from the 
light and humorous to the profoundly 
strange. In the "Vacation" issue, writer 
William Below offered "Dr. Bill's Vaca-
tion Theory" as advice to the typical 
American traveler. "Surely," he wrote, 
"if the United States is the petri dish of

Greene was able to incorporate many 
of his ideas into the scripts. As a result, 
his role was transformed into a more 
dynamic one. 
"1 found myself talking more about 
what I wanted to say. But in the end, it 
was my image that was really im-
portant. My character was never 
meant to be 'a real person'." 
Greene has made a transition into a 
different kind of performance. "I am 
still performing," he explained, "but I 
am doing it in a way that allows me to 
incorporate my own ideas."

"I want to learn to do things my way," 
Greene said.
