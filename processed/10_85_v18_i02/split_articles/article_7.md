Windows on the World 
The electronics department at Macy's 
has 73 TV sets. I counted them while 
shopping for towels across the aisle in 
the bath shop. Glancing up from a pile 
of blue Martex washcloths, I was 
suddenly confronted by a presidential 
news conference and 73 
smiling 
Ronald Reagans making short state-
ments about apartheid. I watched it for 
a little while; I like to watch things on 
TV. 

But 
no love for television, 
however great or small, could have 
prepared me 
for a spectacle this 
confounding and bizarre. There on the 
third floor of Macy's, next door to the 
bedding and shower curtains, just 
steps away from the cookware and 
coffee pots, the miracle of living color 
had swept me away to a land of live-
broadcast special reports. Imagine a 
world with 73 Ronald Reagans. I was 
living in it. 

If only it had been Wheel of Fortune 
splashed across those 73 screens, then I 
could have comforted myself with 
some Baudelairean mutterings about 
the perception of beauty in sleaze and 
grotesquerie. No go. There was no 
game show host, no smiling Pat Sajack 
or his lovely assistant Vana White to 
help me out of this one. This was me 
and the medium in a no-holds-barred, 
steel-cage grudge match in the middle 
of Macy's, and boy was I scared. 

From the bath shop I could just 
barely make out the President's words, 
but his image was clear, warm, and 
echoed across the TV screens. This 
mass dosage of mass culture produced 
a panic in me that I hadn't known since 
last November. Back then I was sure, 
popular opinion be damned, that the 
entire election had been decided by 
those TV ads that packaged America 
as a sunny place where folks smile, 
barbecue chicken, and raise flags. "It's 
morning in America. Ron is it: the 
most refreshing face around. Have a 
I 0 The New Journal/October II. 1985 
President and a smile." Now, 10 
months later, I was in Macy's watching 
73 Ronald Reagans and thinking how 
much the commander-in-chief of the 
ship of state reminded me of the 
Skipper on Gilligan's Island. Maybe it 
was those rosy cheeks, all 146 of them, 
that made me expect the President to 
pull out a sailor's cap and playfully 
whack P. W. Both a over the head. 
"Come on little buddy, cut it out!" 
Smiles, laughs, and the frame freezes 
on a grinning state department while 
the theme music comes up and the 
credits roll. The apartheid problem 
ends in time for the 12:30 p.m. 
commercial break. 

My friends at Yale are disapproving 
of my TV habit. 

My 
tales of 
uncovering television treasures, both 
trashy and true, are greeted by 
uncomfortable pauses. "Gee . . . you 
sure watch a lot of TV." People just 
don't seem to understand that it's a thin 
line between love and hate. "Do you 
really love TV?" my roommate Ben 
asked incredulously, his eyes searching 
mine for some glint of hipper-than-the-
masses irony. "There's no way I can 
condone that," he said, shaking his 
head. Neither can I really. Those 
uncomfortable pauses and incredulous 
stares from my friends make me feel as 
though I'm an intellectual suspect. 

They cow me into 
masking my 
enjoyment of television behind theories 
and 
analysis. Through 
mystical 
incantations known only 
to the 
academic elite, I turn the boob tube 
into a window through which I glimpse 
the mood, likes, and trends of some 
America of which I'm not really a part. 

The problem with this sort of analysis 
is it denies that TV reveals something 
about me and why I want my MTV, or 
MTM, or Miami Vice, or whatever. 

It's not just intellectual snobbery 
that makes me uncomfortable with my 
own TV habit. I've seen television 
stripped 
of 
any 
enjoyable 
entertainment value and reduced to 
the beguiling, hypnotic monster so 
many believe it to be. And I've seen all 
this multiplied 73 times over on the 
third floor of Macy's. Yow. 

But it doesn't take a genius to realize 
that TV can be God-awful sometimes. 
Geniuses realize that TV is really a 
capi talist 
tool or some self-
pel petuating brain cancer spawned 
from the murky depths of the junk 
culture itself. They never seem to 
acknowledge that 
people 
watch 
television because it fills a need in their 
lives. It is an honest human need that 
in some way relates to the desire to tell 
and hear stories, a need that has 
followed man from The Odyssey to 
Dynasty. In high school English we 
accepted the seductive but unrealistic 
visions of happy lands, where the 
course of true love is always ultimately 
a success, by practicing a "suspension 
of disbelief." But now we critique the 
seductive but unrealistic visions of 
television with the phrase "mass 
cuJture as mass deception." If there's 
any injustice here it's not in thinking 
that Shakespeare's plays are a better art 
form than situation comedies, but it's 
in assuming that most of America 
doesn't know that already. 

"If you can't drink until you're 21," a 
friend of mine once said, "then I think
