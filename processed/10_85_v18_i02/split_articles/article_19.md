illogical actions of otherwise logical

Gay's description of the human 
mind as depicted by Freud and his ex-
planation of why psychoanalysis can 
and should be used by historians are 
both very convincing. The only major 
stumbling block to Gay's argument are 
his implications that we need to accept 
as correct the body of Freud's work. 

Gay's defense of the need for psycho-
history is convincing, but his de-
fense of Freud and the superiority of 
Freudian theory is not. Although {.;ay 
devotes an entire chapter justifying his 
preference of standard Freudianism to 
other forms of psychoanalysis, he 
doesn't offer a convincing argument 
why the map of the human mind 
drawn by a 19th century Viennese doc-
tor is the last word in the discussion. 

Gay acknowledges that psychoanalysis 
is "fallible, incompletely tested, dif-
ficult to apply", but he does not sug-
gest, at least in this book, that there 
could have been anything substantially 
wrong with Freud's thought. Gay may 
not condone historians who quote 
Freud as an authority, but he does call 
Freud's stature in the history of the 
modern mind "virtually unique," a 
strong claim .to make for one man. 

Granted, Gay's book is a defense of 
Freud- not 
the best arena 
for 
criticism- but to propose the use of 
Freudian theory as anything but a 
beginning research hypothesis exposes 
Gay to the same charges of reduc-
tionism and 
lack of perspective 
that 
Freud's 
disciples 
have. been 
defending themselves against for the 
last 80 years, the same charges that 
Gay's book attempts to put to rest. A 
model must be found if we are going to 
talk about the human psyche, but that 
model must remain open to criticism if 
its use is to be at all progressive. 

As Gay recognizes, the issue at hand 
is no less than the nature of history 
itself: whether we simply write history 
over and over again from a new 
standpoint of the era, or whether the 
study of history actually gets better and 
better, and can be more or less 
truthfuL And in short, Gay seems to 
propose that the stable, unchanging 
theory of human nature offered by 
psychoanalytic theory provides a 
virtually certain way out of historical 
subjectivism, implying that Freudian 
theory goes beyond the individual 
biases- and neuroses-of particular 
historians. 

There is nothing inherently wrong 
with Gay's original project. If 
historians are going to discuss human 
motivations and passions, a search for 
standards and methods of description 
can only be beneficial. Even the 
common 
language 
the 
terminology of psychoanalysis 
provides can only make such 
discussion between historians easier. 

However , when the historian begins to 
talk about dependability and certainty, 
when the assumptions of the Freudian 
model or any 
model 
are left 
unchallenged, the use of psychoanaly-
sis closes oiT rather than opens up the 
exploration of the human mind.
