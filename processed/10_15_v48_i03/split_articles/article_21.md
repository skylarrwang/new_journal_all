promise, at the very highest levels, of the candidate’s 
research and scholarship, as well as excellent teaching 
and engaged University citizenship within and beyond 
a department or program […] Tenured faculty at Yale 
are expected to stand among the foremost in their ﬁelds 
in the world.”
As a student, that is exactly the kind of person I want 
teaching all of my classes. But for faculty, “there is a 
general vagueness about the criteria for tenure,” as X 
tells me. “It is unclear whether two books is enough [in 
the humanities and social sciences], though some peo-
ple receive tenure having published only one book.” 
The nebulous nature of the criteria causes anxiety.
“Research, teaching, service—to excel at the high-
est level in all three is virtually impossible,” says 
Charles Musser, a tenured professor of film and 
media studies. “If they wanted to shoot you down, 
they can always find a category. At least, that was the 
feeling that was shared by my cohort group of junior 
faculty as we faced the tenure process.” Though the 
intricate process could not be described as arbitrary, 
student spectators and faculty climbing the ladder 
are left in the dark at decision time.  
X reiterated what Lofton had told me—scholarship 
is what matters; teaching and service to the University 
don’t count as much. It would be easy to blame this on 
academia more broadly, except this is not the case at all 
top-tier universities. At Cornell, for instance, where X 
studied, students are asked to write letters of evaluation 
when professors came up for tenure.  
In which I realize that meritocracy and democ-
racy are not the same type of light ﬁxture
When Gendler introduced the lighting analogy to 
me, she told me that she was curious why a student 
wanted to learn the wiring at all. I said that I didn’t 
think most undergraduates had a grasp on how the sys-
tem worked. Like me, they got upset when they lost a 
faculty member who had made a difference in their 
academic career. Most, however, had little idea as to 
what had led to a beloved teacher’s release.
Generally, we aren’t keeping tabs on who has tenure 
and who is awaiting it. “It’s great news that undergrad-
uates are not worried about who’s in what role—that 
means we are hiring great faculty across the board,” 
Gendler told me, adding that students were often not 
sensitive to the “formal University academic role of the 
faculty whom they learn from.”
I thought back to J. D. Connor’s revelatory lectures 
and felt scorned because his apparent popularity among 
students appeared to have little to no effect in dictating 
his reception by the Yale tenure machine. It felt like I 
had entered some kind of dystopian novel where the 
paternalistic government was hiding things from its cit-
izens to keep them content. Where was my ability to 
effect change? Had I ever had that ability? From Lof-
ton, I knew the current review committee was working 
hard to ﬁnd a way to better evaluate teaching in the 
tenure process and to make the entire process more

transparent, but I felt that these changes were promises 
designed to appease. By that point, people like Connor 
would already have left for other universities.
       It took a conversation with a professor study-
ing labor history to calm me down. Michael Denning, 
the current DUS of American Studies, has been at Yale 
since the 1980s, and has observed the tenure process 
through its multiple iterations. He said that in the last 
thirty years, the essence has hardly changed.
“The ethos back then—I’ll put it on the positive side, 
which is their way of seeing it—[was] to get tenure you 
must be one of the leading people in your ﬁeld. This 
maintains Yale’s rhetoric of excellence. You wouldn’t 
be here as a student if not for that.” My immediate 
impulse, as a student, was to refute this statement. I am 
not a selﬁsh person.
I opened my mouth to interrupt, but was silenced by 
his next words: “At a democratic institution, it would 
be important to understand the wiring. However, Yale 
is far from a democratic higher-education institution.” 
I had thought the tenure system was broken. But the 
problem wasn’t the system; I had made a labeling error 
in the lighting department.
In which I ﬁnd myself at the light switch
I was disappointed. Disappointed because it was my 
mistake, not theirs. Disappointed because Yale was not 
more like Disneyland. Disappointed because, more 
than anything, I felt incredibly relieved—I had been 
let off the hook.
Yale is a place in which the wiring is not ideal, but 
the lighting is ﬂattering. Though the system is far from 
humane for faculty, the research-focused rigor of the 
tenure system contributes heavily to Yale’s claim as 
one of the world’s leading academic institutions. As 
students, there is real economic value in being able to 
claim this name brand as our own. At the same time, 
we beneﬁt from a cycle of imaginative classes taught by 
new, energetic professors striving for tenure. Under the 
current tenure system, though great teaching and great 
renown may not go hand in hand, they are not mutu-
ally exclusive. But ultimately, the wiring isn’t our con-
cern as students. We can see the lights, so we know the 
system’s working ﬁne. And the self-loathing of being 
another conductive element in the great mass of wires 
will wear off by the start of the next semester.
