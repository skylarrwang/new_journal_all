it is cold more often than it is warm in the courtyard 
of Silliman College. A rectangular plot of grass divided 
by stone paths and lined on four sides by Georgian, 
French Renaissance, and Gothic residential buildings, 
it is a house-and-ﬁeld setup. It’s a function of the col-
lege’s expansive structure, dating from a time when 
people believed that sod and sun would make you 
moral. Last year, seventeen Adirondack chairs (eight in 
chili pepper red and nine in chili pepper green) were 
placed in the courtyard. But recently, the chairs have 
started to go missing. At press time, seven remain. SG, 
the Silliman operations manager, says it has become a 
problem, which has made the community start asking 
the necessary questions. Not “who would want to steal 
these fucking plastic Adirondack chairs?” But “why are 
they here in the ﬁrst place?”

i
The chairs are designed to accommodate the posture 
of a reclining middle-aged man. This might be because 
they were designed by one.  The Adirondack chair was 
invented for use exclusively as a piece of summer home 
furniture. Though Adirondack chairs were initially 
made of wood, Silliman’s are of a thick, high quality, 
lightweight plastic.  As a result, they are good conduc-
tors of heat in warm weather and can become hazard-
ous to sit in. Regardless, it is cold more than it is warm 
in the Silliman Courtyard, and there are no summer 
homes here. The chairs are an example of what may be 
called an “Institution,” what Professor Elijah Anderson 
describes in lecture on Wednesday afternoon as “An 
established way of doing something that effectively out-
lives its biological inheritance. The way of life persists, 
and the people involved in it die off and disappear.”  

ii
There is a rumor around Silliman that people have 
been using the Adirondack chairs for “pants-on sex,” 
and that the administration removed them in a ﬁt of 
moral fervor and is now just pretending that the chairs 
are missing, so that no one will know how afraid of 
sex the administration really is. The rumor is widely 
considered untenable, because SG keeps hemorrhag-
ing daily email reminders about the social contract: 
“Things that are intended to be used in common are 
not intended for private use.” Presumably he wouldn’t 
do this if the administration were thieving the chairs. 
The girl I used to live with, who sometimes ate pizza 
and drank brandy in the Adirondack chairs while wait-
ing for her rugby man to come home, says she “would 
do it, no, has done it in the hammock, but never, never 
in an Adirondack chair.” All of this seems to refute the 
rumored use of the Adirondack chairs.

C works in the Silliman dining hall, has worked there 
for 15+ years, and does not plan on leaving any time

soon. Her job is standing at the dining hall’s entrance, 
running ID cards through a scanner, and sliding a 
damp rag over tables between meals. C believes the 
chairs are disappearing because “kids have been drink-
ing,” but does not view their absence as signiﬁcant. She 
focuses on the fact that she has “more than most people 
I know:” a courtyard to walk across and a job on the 
other side. C is missing a toe and stands all day.

Benjamin Silliman was Yale’s ﬁrst science professor. 
He gave the campus some laws of the universe and lent 
his name to a college built by the Vanderbilt family. 
Benjamin Silliman collected meteors. As far as I can 
tell, a meteor is just a really big rock. It is only a meteor 
because it came to us from space. Although it is hard 
for us to say precisely where space begins or ends, it was 
even harder for Benjamin Silliman. When Benjamin 
Silliman wanted to look at his meteor, he probably took 
it out of its protective case, held it up to his eyeball, and 
marveled at holding something of the universe in his 
palm. To examine it more carefully, he may have had 
to sit in something like an Adirondack chair. Possibly, 
we’ve found another use for the chairs in the Silliman 
courtyard. See: Original Master of the Universe.
The Peabody Award-winning broadcaster, New York 
Times bestselling author, and recipient of the 2014 
National Humanities Medal says, “Virtues – so closely 
bound to our ﬂaws and failings – lie at the heart of the 
mystery of the human capacity to be present to the 
ﬂawed and failing world.”

In Silliman, it matters when money is spent. There is 
no winery, or special night of Italian food, or bottle of 
champagne for every senior. The student cocktail par-
ties are fueled by buttery snacks on paper plates. There 
are sometimes rats in the basement. These small lack-
ings are exacerbated by relativism, the gauge of life at 
Yale where everything is judged by what it is not. It is 
still Yale and grand and all that, but “we don’t have 
a winery” and “my freshman counselor ran out of the 
good candy.” So the Adirondack chairs feel new and 
special. In them, you can sit and aspire to something 
greater, a college more like the one in “Mona Lisa 
Smile” where Kirsten Dunst fell in love and married 
a doctor and still found feminism. It is where every-
one walks their dogs and throws their Frisbees and 
pretends it is warm enough for lawn furniture.  It is a 
vestige, maybe, something to hold onto when the anx-
ious winds of Recession and Political Correctness and 
Institutional Memory come beating at the gates. This 
is the Institution’s last pair of real gold earrings: seven-
teen Adirondack Chairs in chili pepper red and chili 
pepper green.
