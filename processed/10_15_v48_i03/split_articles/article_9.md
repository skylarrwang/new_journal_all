EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
“Manufacturing Cool,” the September issue’s pop-music story, has an ambiguous 
title — it stands there without a time, without a subject, without a place. But the 
author, Jordan Coley, is happy to locate who is doing this “manufacturing” at 
Yale right now, and it happens to be people and places dear to me. As a member 
of WYBC for the past four years and an executive board member for the last two, 
and a current resident of 216, I felt that my organization, my home, and my 
character were attacked.

Coley writes of “a number of acts on campus embracing a less accessible 
sound”— who are these acts? Coley writes that “students […] cultivate what 
some would call a more ‘alternative’ type of music”— again, which students are 
doing this cultivating, and also, who are the “some” that are calling it alterna-
tive? To me, these vague terms, which no one can really refute outright, display 
a lack of thorough investigation. But the greatest objection I have to this under-
reporting is how conveniently it lends itself to a reductive portrait of Yale.

Coley writes: “You would probably ﬁnd it hard to believe that [Carly Rae  
Jepsen’s “Call Me Maybe”] — or one like it — would ever be performed at 216, 
the dim basement venue that features local and student bands. There is an 
accepted division: bands and independent performers at Yale are the indie 
rockers, bar spitters, jazz players, electronic DJs, R&B singers — the ‘alternative.’ 
Pop blares from the speakers of a crowded party or is preceded by a pitch pipe.”

Who accepts this division, exactly? Certainly not me. Certainly not the 
people who dedi-cate themselves to bringing shows to 216, and certainly not 
the bands that play there. To provide just one concrete example from a show 
at 216 — which is more than there are in the article — our most well-attended 
shows last year were headlined by Slam Dank, a group whose own lead singer 
Keren Abreu calls a pop act. Keren is just one person whose tastes and craft 
complicate the simple narrative of this article, and I refuse to believe that she 
is an exception. The pop-music makers in this article share a feeling that they 
are judged, as  Sarah Solovay succinctly puts it, because “the kind of music you 
make reﬂects how complex you are, so making mainstream music exposes you 
as shallow or basic.” I don’t doubt that her experiences have led her to believe 
this, but when I think back on a basement full of eager Slam Dank fans, it is 
clear to me that this is not every pop musician’s nor every pop fan’s experience 
at Yale.

While the article reads like reportage about “manufacturing cool” on this 
campus, it glosses over its own role in this manufacture. When Coley calls “the 
indie rockers, bar spitters, jazz players, electronic DJs, R&B singers” alterna-
tive, he manufactures his own deﬁnition of the genre. One only needs to think 
of Kanye West, Nicki Minaj, Diplo, and Mariah Carey to realize that not all 
pop acts ﬁt into his narrow (and remarkably white) model of “Pop that birthed 
talents like Britney Spears, Katy Perry, and Justin Bieber” and to see how poorly 
such a division between pop and alternative holds up. When Chris Capello, 
one of the few sources, accuses a party at 216 of playing Taylor Swift alongside 
PC Music as a display of coolness, he crafts a cynical image of people obsessed 
with status, leaving out the possibility that people were just enjoying the music. 
Good, responsible journalism does not thrust deﬁnitions and worldviews 
onto people who may not share them. It does not ignore the complexities of 
subjects as vast as mainstream culture in the United States or as contained as 
the music scene on campus. I write this not just as member of WYBC and a 
resident of 216, but also as a reader who expects better from the things we write 
and publish at Yale.
