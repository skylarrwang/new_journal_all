i eased the suv down a rough dirt road in northeastern 
Connecticut. My friend Téa, who sat in the passenger’s 
seat, peered into the shady woods ahead. She checked her 
phone to see if we were still headed in the right direction, 
but she didn’t have any service. Her hands ﬁddled with 
pens and papers, nervously sketching the twisted shapes 
of branches and leaves as we went around the next bend.

Then we were there, at Myers Forest, the largest of 
Yale’s seven forests. More speciﬁcally, we were at a camp-
ground that the Yale School of Forestry has used since 
1919. We’d been driving around the forest for the last 
twenty minutes, weaving around groves of oak, hemlock, 
and pine. There’s a reason the trip was so long: Myers 
Forest is the largest piece of Yale property and one of the 
largest private forests in southern New England. On the 
drive over from i - 84, we had traced the northern edge of 
the nearly eight thousand acres.

Trees lit by the ﬁery colors of fall rimmed the shallow 
lakes alongside the road. Ahead of us, the tangled woods 
opened into a small clearing. A few long, low wooden build-
ings—bunkhouses for when the forest has guests—were 
scattered across the ﬁeld. They are mainly used in August 
when the ﬁrst-year forestry students have orientation, or 
when the School of Forestry & Environmental Studies 
holds seminars. Last winter, for example, the School held 
a community lecture on tracking animals in forests. Pro-
fessors also use the camp as a staging ground for the for-
ty-ﬁve research projects currently being run at the forest. 
Some projects study the economics of forestry, looking 
for new ways to make conservation cheaper. One of 
many ecosystem projects focuses on the forest’s vernal 
pools, seasonal bodies of water that dictate the life cycle 
of salamanders. 

We tend to think of the wilderness as a place to be 
protected from the relentless economic forces of human 
expansion, lest it be lost forever. But Myers Forest stands 
as living evidence that this conventional wisdom is wrong. 
Myers is a place where we look under the hood of for-
ests, examining the forces that drive their dynamism and 
resilience. Rather than loss, it tells a story of reclamation: 
its roots run deep through old farmland, across property 
abandoned during the age of westward expansion.  

Only one hundred years ago, Myers Forest was a patch-
work of farms in various states of decay. Now, vines cover 
the remnants of building foundations. Each rainy sea-
son, dirt and silt ﬁll the old wells. To the trained eye, the 
composition of the forest contradicts its youth: it’s almost 
entirely ﬁlled with hardwood trees, like oak and maple, 
which can only grow after pine trees take root in empty 
ﬁelds and provide shade for seedlings.

But this reclamation has been guided and shaped by 
foresters, whose job it is to make forests environmentally 
and economically sustainable. They meticulously cata-
logue, tree by tree, to maximize the diversity and health 
of the species in the forest. Today, the forest is managed 
completely by Yale. It is the home of the Quiet Corner 
Initiative, a partnership that pairs the School of Forestry 
with local private landowners, natural resource managers, 
and forest professionals to improve the health of forests 
across the state.

I tracked down Professor Mark Ashton, the director of 
the School forest system, who gave me a brief overview of 
Myer’s ecological importance and history. We sat around 
a ﬁre pit next to the crumbling foundation of a barn. He 
talked about the broader importance of New England’s 
forests: “Water ﬁlters down through the canopy, through 
the root system, and into the rivers and aquifers we get our 
drinking water from,” he told me, gesturing to the leaves 
and needles around us. “Urban planners in the Northeast 
realized that we had to protect our surface watershed by 
planting trees.”  

According to Ashton, the rich network of forests in 
New England, most of which was planted in the last hun-
dred years, is one of the main reasons our drinking water 
is some of the best in the nation. “Without forests—in 
places like Louisiana, for example—instead of spending 
millions of dollars on a system that nature helps clean, 
you end up spending billions designing and engineering
