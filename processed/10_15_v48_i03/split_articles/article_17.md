andalucía has fewer words than I do. One of my 
professors here tells me English has three or four ways 
of saying anything in Castilian, Spain’s most-spoken 
Spanish, the one we speak here, in Granada. Some 
say the ratio’s more like 2-to-1. The comparison gets 
harder when you think about all the country’s unof-
ﬁcial tongues—Basque, Catalan, Galician—but going 
by my ﬁve-pound Spanish-English dictionary, the lim-
it’s on the Castilian side. Sometimes I like that about 
Spanish, that there’s less of it. Madura: it means both 
ripe and mature, and I like how the word cups all the 
touchable time, from beginning until the start of decay.
But I’m living in a university city where it took my 
friend Anabel a ﬁve-minute walk to think of more than 
three ways to say she had sex. First: foyar, to fuck, which 
young people use. Then the formal ways—tener sexo, 
tener relaciones sexuales, practicar sexo—which they 
don’t. Acostarse con, to sleep with, for an in-between. 
And a few minutes later we had me lo tiré, or me la tiré, 
depending on the sex of the direct object. That you 
can say if your friend points someone out in the street. 
I fucked him; I fucked her. The direct translation is 
something about throwing him to yourself.
So that’s six. “We are simple, I guess,” said Anabel. 
In America, we do all of those, besides admit to need-
ing practice. But there’s enough vocabulary that I feel 
like half of my relationships are spent trying to decide 
how to classify our sex, if only to myself. We banged, 
screwed, nailed, made love. I tapped, hit, did. Got 
lucky, got it on, got busy, got down, got laid. Knew, in 
the biblical sense. Or knew him better last year.
The Spanish verb for taking a photograph is sacar: 
to take out or remove. You sacar la basura (take out 
the trash); sacar dinero (withdraw money); sacar parte 
del cuerpo (stick out a body part); sacar defectos (show 
someone the defects). In English, the language is sim-
ilar—you take a photograph; it is taken. But there’s 
something about the added out that contributes to the 
feeling I often have in Granada of reaching for some-
thing that isn’t mine to take.
I will be here for ﬁve months, and it’s been two and 
a half weeks now. I’ve had time to walk around with my 
camera. I’ve been around the Alhambra and the pub-
lic gardens, with the peacocks; the old Jewish quarter; 
the white Albaicín. The other day I was following a 
road that curved along and inside a high school tucked 
into a hill, in Sacromonte, the sector on the far side 
of the mountain, where things are more residential. 
There were a lot of trees, and it was very quiet, and the 
gates had been open; but at one point there was a girl 
who saw me through the window of her classroom and 
I thought, what made me think I’m entitled to be here?
There is a tourist habit that I’ve noticed, and that I 
have, of visiting foreign countries and photographing 
doors, windows, and clotheslines. So European, how 
the bras are swinging around up there, the lace backlit 
by the sky. How the doors are colorful, and smaller, and 
the windows have shutters that people actually open 
and close. The clotheslines are especially exciting, like 
an open-air gallery where the artist’s intimacies haven’t 
even been abstracted. Visually, I like them, and I like 
the doors, and it’s my instinct—American or human, or 
personal, I don’t know—to claim what I see and like. I 
can’t help wanting certain colors or angles or gestures 
for my personal archives, so I have a small sketchbook, 
too, that I keep with me, especially if I don’t want to 
carry around my camera.

through by his cross-topped staff. Pomegranates grow 
on trees here. When ripe, some open themselves.
At home, at school a year ago, my friend Jake told 
me he thought it was sad, the way people hooked up 
with each other and said it didn’t mean anything. That 
people got drunk and let themselves be public in their 
looking for intimacy, and everyone was looking for it, 
but then you woke up in the morning and nothing was 
there. I said maybe, not always. A lot of the time people 
just want that feeling of being wanted for a little. The 
two are not the same, always.
The other night a guy was walking me home, to the 
Spanish dorm I was staying at before I moved in with 
my host family. I started talking to him about a book 
I had almost packed but didn’t, because there wasn’t 
space. It’s called I Want to Show You More. I bought 
it on Amazon a while ago. From what I remember, it’s 
stories, I think about sex, written by a woman. I trailed 
off, though, when describing it, because I realized the 
only reason I was bringing it up was that I felt that way 
then, like there was more I wanted to show him, and 
I didn’t think I knew him well enough to tell him I 
wanted him to know me better.
Show is only half right. It’s a mixture of wanting to 
give, like give of myself, and show, and share. Express 
sounds like it should work, but it doesn’t. The word 
might be reveal, and in a question. How much do you 
want to see? 
In Spanish, conquistar is the verb with which you 
win someone’s love. There are others—enamorarse 
con, amelcocharse, encampanarse (this one I like: it 
also means to become complicated, get difﬁcult)—but 
conquistar is the one you can do to someone. In my 
dictionary from 1989, conquistador translates to three 
things: conqueror; conquering, in adjective form; and 
lady-killer. [And I found one more word for sex: enca-
marse con—to sleep with someone, though without 
the con it means instead to fall ill or to be beaten down, 
like wheat, under wind or rain.
But it bothers me to see a woman come out of her 
home and catch me photographing her neighbor’s win-
dow, or her cat. Drawing seems better, but I don’t know 
if it is—better because old people think it’s charming, 
and that’s validating, maybe; or because laying some-
thing down in your own hand automatically denotes 
a degree of human error. You put yourself into it, you 
leave something behind. On good days, I decide that’s 
a compromise—that my drawing something is fair 
because I’m making something new, that belongs to 
me as much as it does to the subject I’ve refracted. On 
bad days, I think maybe it’s worse, that I’m assuming 
an intimacy that grants me the authority to re-interpret 
what I don’t understand. 
I don’t feel like such a voyeur in America, maybe 
because there I’m only ever taking what feels like mine. 
This land is your land; this land is my land. In some 
defensible way, I’m only claiming what I already have. 
But Spain does not have these songs, or this sentiment. 
Or at least she hasn’t shared it with me.
I took a writing class last semester called At Home 
in America. We read personal essays and narrative 
nonfiction, all focused on the experience of being 
an American, in America. My professor quoted Joan 
Didion, often. “A place belongs forever to whoever 
claims it hardest, remembers it most obsessively, 
wrenches it from itself, shapes it, renders it, loves it 
so radically that he remakes it in his image.” Then 
we would go home and tried to lay verbal claim to 
what we were trying to see. 
But now I am in a city in a country that people 
have been claiming, hard, for centuries. Conquest, 
re-conquest, inquisition, exile; centuries of constant 
inter-kingdom warfare. For a language with a third as 
many words as I’ve grown up with, Castilian has three 
words to match my “wall.” Pared, muro, muralla—the 
last one for the sweeping stone encircling medieval 
towns. You have to enter through an archway on a walled, 
uphill road—first turn to the right, so an invader’s 
right-handed sword swing hits wall. I saw one of these 
archways in Ronda. I took a picture.
And Granada: the Moors’ last stronghold in all of 
Spain, she ﬁnally gave herself over in 1492, the same 
year Colón gained Isabel’s consent for the conquest 
I know best. That was a few miles west, in Santa Fe, 
a town Fernando built to support Granada’s siege. I 
understood it all better at Colón’s tomb, in the cathe-
dral at Sevilla. Four courtiers, representing his life-
time’s other four Spanish kingdoms, march in statue, 
each holding a corner of Colón’s cofﬁn. And Granada, 
la granada, the pomegranate, the last kingdom left 
un-Christian: she’s the fruit at the foot of the front-
right cofﬁn-bearer, opened and crushed and stabbed
