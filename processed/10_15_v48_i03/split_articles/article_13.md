nurse midwife nancy degennaro demonstrated strad-
dling positions on a large exercise ball for Rose Gallegos, 
an expecting mother sitting next to her. “Sometimes 
we would have her sit on it this way,” Degennaro said, 
squatting on the ball, opening her legs wide, acting out 
Gallegos’s possible future delivery. “Sometimes we have 
her lean on it this way,” she said, moving to rest her ﬂat 
tummy on the ball. “We just get creative.” 

Getting creative is part of the birthing philosophy in 
Yale’s midwifery department, located at Yale–New Haven 
Hospital’s St. Raphael campus on Chapel Street. An alter-
native to the ob/gyn maternity ward, the department staffs 
midwives, who are licensed to deliver children and pro-
vide holistic birth-related care. Mothers are encouraged 
to take ownership of the birthing process. Instead of lying 
ﬂat on their backs in a hospital bed, they move around, 
play birth playlists, and order takeout. There are exercise 
balls used for sitting and bouncing to open the pelvis, a 
bar that allows for pushing while in a squat position, and 
tubs and showers for hydrotherapy. Mothers can decide 
to give birth on all fours in a large, lavender-scented tub. 

Dana Oakes-Sand is a doula, meaning that she is 
trained to provide emotional support before, during, and 
after birth but does not have a medical degree. “I had 
a patient play Skrillex while giving birth,” she told me. 
“That was an experience.” 

With warm lighting, ambient instrumental music, 
and large photographs of newborn babies, the mid-
wifery department looks and feels a little like a womb—
comforting, quiet, red-tinted. During a tour of the 
department for October’s National Midwifery Week, 
nurse-midwife Erin McMahon reached up to brush a 
crumb off my sweater, a bracelet inscribed with “Kind-
ness Changes Everything” sliding up her arm. Tradi-
tional boundaries of personal space seem to melt away. 

Nearly every midwife, nurse, or doula would nudge me 
to make a point, or let their hands rest on my arm while 
we laughed. Someone even grabbed a pen from my 
back pocket while my hands were full. 

Although ob/gyns meet with patients many times before 
the birth, the visits tend to be physical exams. Nurse Katie 
Brady, who has been at ynhh for thirty years, sees midwife 
care as a more holistic alternative. “The difference between 
midwifery care and the, how shall I say it?” she asked, turn-
ing to her co-workers, “the traditional medical model? … It’s 
more supportive, a more calming environment.” 

Founded in 1956, Yale’s professional midwifery program 
is one of the oldest in the country. It was born during a 
period of decline in midwifery, as ob/gyns replaced mid-
wives as the primary caregivers for pregnant women in the 
1950s. Practicing nurse Michelle Telfer attributes the shift 
away from midwives to changing attitudes toward wom-
en’s health in the early twentieth century. “Pregnancy 
came to be seen more as pathological, more as a disease to 
be treated, more as a danger to women’s health,” she said. 

As birth became clinical, midwives’ traditional approach 
led to the stereotype that they were “unclean witches 
with gnarled hands,” said associate professor of nursing 
Heather Reynolds. 

ob/gyns delivered almost all American babies until 
the feminist revolution of the 1970s when, Reynolds said, 
“women started to look for alternatives to heavy sedation 
and started to demand a family birth experience.” This 
shifted ob/gyn practices—fathers were allowed in the 
delivery room for the ﬁrst time, and caregivers began to 
emphasize nutrition, cultural needs, and the physical 
changes of pregnancy. This change in attitudes also led 
to an uptick in midwife-assisted births. (According to the 
Centers for Disease Control, between 1975 and 2002, the 
percentage of midwife-assisted births rose from less than 
one percent to 8.2 percent.) 

Midwives try to maintain an air of unique approachabil-
ity. The word “midwife” comes from the Germanic Middle 
English root of “mid” (meaning with) and “wife” (meaning 
woman): “with-woman.” The etymology reveals the their 
role as one of accompaniment and support. As explained to 
me by Richard Jennings, the only male nurse-midwife on 
the Yale team, “midwife” refers to the gender of the mother,

rather than the healthcare provider. “What do you call a 
male midwife?” he asked me. “A midwife?” I answered, con-
fused. “No,” he joked. “A delivery boy.”

In America, most babies are still delivered by an ob/
gyn. In almost every other country, midwives, both male 
and female, deliver most children, with ob/gyns only 
involved when complications occur. According to Oakes-
Sand, American women fear birth and labor pain more 
than women in other cultures. She pointed to a study in 
which scientists asked women in Japan whether they were 
afraid of childbirth, and their responses indicated that 
they seemed surprised that anyone would be. Describing 
her sense of the prevailing attitude in Japan, she said, “I 
might be afraid of a tsunami, or a volcano, but birth? Why 
would I be afraid of birth?” 

For many American women, childbirth is pathol-
ogized—an event of hospitals, screaming, and white-
coated doctors. “We are taught to fear pain,” practicing 
nurse midwife Michelle Telfer said, “but labor pain is dif-
ferent.” Many ob/gyns try to eliminate pain with epidur-
als, which numb women from the waist down. Though 
midwives offer epidurals, they prefer to use alternative 
methods of pain management. “It doesn’t mean she has to 
go through it unmedicated,” said Telfer, “but our bodies 
work, and it can be a very powerful experience for women 
to go through that process.” Back in the labor room, 
Degennaro pointed to a tank of nitrous oxide, or laughing 
gas, which some women use to alleviate pain and relax. 

Animatedly, she told of one woman’s birthing process in 
which, “We laughed her baby out.” 

“Laughing a baby out” constitutes a radically different 
image than the conventional one of an American soon-
to-be-mom: sweat-drenched, screaming, ﬂat on her back. 
Looking around at the props in the labor room, giving 
birth with a midwife seems more like a new exercise class 
fad than The Most Painful Experience Ever.

Yale’s health care plan does not cover birth through 
midwifery for undergraduates, graduate students, or fac-
ulty. The only option available under the Yale health plan 
is an ob/gyn birth. Among American health care plans, 
this is fairly common.

Still, the ubiquity of ob/gyn births in the United States 
can come as a shock to people from other countries—most 
international health care plans do cover midwifery care. At 
Yale, Telfer said, the response of many foreign faculty and 
graduate students is, “What do you mean, we don’t have 
midwife care?” 

When I met Sarah, a young Israeli doctoral student, 
she was bouncing her nine-month-old daughter, coo-
ing to her. Sarah, whose name has been changed at  
her request, delivered her daughter with an ob/gyn via 
cesarean section. As C-sections go, she said, she had 
the best possible experience, but she would have pre-
ferred a vaginal delivery.

Though these procedures are routine and low-risk, a 
cesarean section is, as Telfer described it, “major abdom-
inal surgery” that should be used only as a last resort. 
The cdc reports that 32.7 percent of American women 
gave birth via C-section in 2013, more than double the 
recommended regional rate of the World Health Organi-
zation. As one nurse, who wished to remain anonymous, 
said, the mindset of many in the medical ﬁeld is such 
that “one intervention”—such as an epidural—“leads 
to another,”—such as an episiotomy, the cutting of the 
vagina to allow the baby more room—“to another,”—a 
C-section. Midwives, who generally employ fewer inter-
ventions, have C-section rates of six percent. 

Sarah believes that she could have avoided a C-sec-
tion had she worked with a midwife. “I just thought the 
C-section was unnecessary,” she said, shrugging. “I had 
perfect conditions: I am big, I had a small baby, I had full 
dilation. I pushed and pushed and pushed and for three 
hours, she didn’t come out. I am sure that if I would have 
been moving…” Sarah trailed off. But believes that the 
alternative tactics of midwifery, like walking, would have 
allowed her to give birth vaginally. 

Women and couples covered by the Yale Health Plan 
seeking midwife care have two options: give birth with 
an ob/gyn or pay out of pocket. This often proves too 
costly—according to the pregnancy website What to 
Expect, a birthing center birth costs about three thousand 
dollars. Telfar explained that many of her patients who 
pay out of pocket choose a home birth, which can cost 
as little as ﬁfteen hundred dollars. “It’s cheaper overall,” 
she said, “but for women who don’t feel comfortable with 
that, they don’t have much of an option.”

 “I would have come here, [to the midwifery ward] if 
it had been covered,” Sarah said. “I tried. I asked if I can, 
they said no, and so I just accepted it.” Sarah intends to 
purchase another health care plan to have her next child 
at St. Raphael’s midwifery department. 

Though women like Sarah turn to midwives to gain 
more control over their births, midwifery remains unpop-
ular among New Haven residents and Americans alike—
hence the need for tours like the one in October. As I 
packed my camera away and readied myself to leave, 
nurse-midwife Melanie Albright shrugged. “We help 
them write their own stories,” she said of the mothers she 
and the other Yale midwives have helped. “Anything we 
can do to get the word out.” With that, she turned to show 
another small group around the ﬂoor.
