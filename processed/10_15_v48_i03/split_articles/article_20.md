The wiring of the tenure track

disneyland “is the real country presented as imag-
inary to make us think other things are real,” says J.D. 
Connor, an assistant professor in the History of Art 
Department at the close of a lecture in his course on Dis- 
ney. “But the real is no longer real.”

“Mind blown,” the student next to me whispers.


As usual, when J. D. Connor speaks about ﬁlm, he 
leaves me feeling that if I listened hard enough, I, too, 
could use the clues in pop culture to unlock the invisi-
ble workings of the universe.


Professor Connor has been my faculty advisor, my 
tour guide through both America’s most iconic media 
corporation and, in a class dedicated to the JFK assas-
sination, the real-life political thriller that’s been an 
American obsession for the past ﬁfty years. More than 
2,600 Yale graduate and professional students voted 
him to be one of the humanities lecturers at the 2015 
Inspiring Yale event; more than two hundred students 
enrolled in his course on Disney this semester. But 
despite his popularity and gift for teaching, Yale has 
decided to let J. D. Connor go.


Last spring, when professor Connor informed me 
that he was up for promotion and would be on leave 
next year if all went well, I worried that I would be 
without an advisor for my junior year. Any other pos-
sible outcome never occurred to me. Until he was 
denied promotion from assistant professor to “associate 
on term,” the tenure track was something to which I 
had given little thought. When I admit this to Tamar 
Gendler, the dean of the faculty of arts and sciences, 
she tells me that, too, is a part of the tenure process: 
“There’s no reason [students] should have to know 
how the walls are wired. They just want the lights to 
be bright.”


But suddenly, a bulb was out, and I wanted to know 
why. I tried my best to perform diagnostics. I knew it 
wasn’t the bulb itself, because Connor was one of the 
best teachers I’d ever had. Instead, I turned my atten-
tion to the wiring, which I did not understand at all.

In which I learn a bit about electrical wiring
Professor Amy Hungerford, who chairs the Tenure 
and Promotions Committee for the humanities, walked 
me through the three criteria that form the basis for 
decisions on tenure—research, teaching, and service. 
It is difﬁcult for faculty to receive tenure if their teach-
ing is poor and shows no signs of improvement, she 
explained. It is equally difﬁcult when the teaching is 
superb but the scholarship is borderline. A weak pub-
lishing record is particularly lethal, in line with the 
adage, “publish or perish.”


“Research will always be the emphasis of Yale,” 
said Kathryn Lofton, a tenured faculty member who 
serves on the committee currently reviewing the ten-
ure system implemented in 2007. The committee is 
set to publish its ﬁndings in 2017, and every ten years 
thereafter. Lofton, a professor of religious studies, has 
a nose ring and a tattoo: she is hardly the image of an 
educational system entrenched in conservative ideals. 
I struggled to reconcile her words with her appearance 
and friendly demeanor.  


I wanted teaching to carry more weight and felt 
compelled to blame my misconceptions about Yale’s 
teaching emphasis on something concrete, so I settled 
on its promotional materials. I went back and watched 
“That’s Why I Chose Yale”—the giant hallmark card 
from the Admissions Ofﬁce to prospective students. 
The video opens with a tour guide ﬁelding questions 
at an info session. A young woman in the front row 
asks, “Is it true that all Yale professors teach?” The tour 
guide replies, “It is true that every tenured professor 
in Yale College teaches undergraduates…” I thought 
the tour guide would ﬁnish his sentence with some-
thing like “which shows the care and thought Yale puts 
into the classroom experience of its students.” He did 
not. Instead, the sentence ends, “… so even a freshman 
might be taking a class from a Nobel Prize winner.”


The guide was implying that prestige or, at least, 
prestige by proxy, is what we’re getting at Yale. This is 
not what I thought I was getting when I came to Yale. 
Perhaps it’s because the University’s message about low 
faculty-to-student ratios and small class sizes is what 
won me over, rather than the promise of glimpsing a 
handful of Nobel laureates. Or maybe that’s how I pre-
ferred to frame my priorities to myself when I came to 
Yale as a freshman. Regardless, I am left with the sus-
picion that I didn’t fully grasp the terms and conditions 
before clicking the “agree” button.


In which I learn that this is not the original wiring
It turns out, there are worse things than the cur-
rent tenure system. Before 2007, Yale’s tenure system 
was a far uglier beast than the one that dictates hiring 
practices today. At that time, junior faculty were hired 
without the guarantee of being considered for tenure. 
Untenured ladder faculty could not remain at Yale for 
more than ten years, so if the ten years passed and the 
department failed to ﬁnd room in its budget to hire a 
tenured professor, the faculty member would be forced 
to leave. If a department did have the resources to 
make a permanent faculty hire, it typically conducted 
a nationwide search to ﬁll the newly available senior 
position. Preference was not given to the junior faculty 
already at Yale.


I came to understand the pre-2007 system as a ten-year 
post-doc. Though Yale could not guarantee junior faculty 
job security, it could offer its untenured faculty world-
class resources, and, more importantly, the Yale seal of 
approval on any published material. Gambling ten years 
of your life on a nineteen percent chance at tenure, how-
ever, seemed a high price to pay for prestige. 


YOU CAN’T DEVELOP 
CLOSE FRIENDSHIPS 
BECAUSE THEY GET 
SWALLOWED UP BY  
THE FOG MACHINE


At the very least, the new system provides a clearer 
path toward consideration for tenure, though Lofton 
stated that the University does not keep data on likeli-
hood of tenure, so it is difficult to compare. To me, the 
reorganization seems by no means satisfactory for all. 
“It’s like The Hunger Games,” said a recently tenured 
faculty member, who I will call X as he asked not to 
be named. It is a good illustration of the contentious-
ness of this issue that out of the thirty professors I asked 
about tenure at Yale, almost all either declined to be 
interviewed or chose the safety of anonymity.  


“You can’t develop close friendships because they get 
swallowed up by the fog machine,” X said. By then end 
of the tenure process, faculty members have watched 
a good portion of their colleagues leave. When, or if, 
they make it through the process, at least some—the 
X’s of the University—have developed survivor’s guilt.


I know that I am not the ﬁrst person to reach the con-
clusion that Yale is something less than paradise for the 
untenured faculty member. This past year, there have 
been several voluntary departures in departments such 
as Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies and Afri-
can American Studies, amid criticism of Yale’s insti-
tutional culture and hiring practices, including the 
tenure process. While some people, like J. D. Connor, 
wait to ﬁnd out that they will be asked to leave, others 
go willingly to places like Columbia, Cornell, the Uni-
versity of Chicago, places where the tenure process is 
sometimes almost halved from Yale’s nine-year process 
to just ﬁve years.


In which I watch the electrician work with my 
eyes closed
The document given to newly hired faculty at Yale 
outlining the tenure process is beautifully laminated. I 
receive this exact shiny piece of paper in plastic from 
Gendler. I have the urge to run it under water. At this 
point in my interviews on the subject of tenure, I have 
heard so much about this chart that it feels like I’m 
meeting a celebrity. At the top of the page is a small, 
colorful chart, which depicts the steps of the post-2007 
tenure system in chronological order. “The fact that 
this chart even exists is an incredible achievement,” 
Lofton had told me at our earlier meeting.


I peruse the picture at my leisure, tracing the process 
from hiring, as a ﬁrst year associate professor, to the 
ﬁnal committee review for tenure. It’s a story told in 
acronyms and italics: the road many of our professors 
are on, but which few of us understand as we listen to 
their lectures and speak with them during ofﬁce hours 
or in seminars.


Junior faculty members at Yale are hired as assis-
tant professors. After leaping over a few compara-
tively lower hurdles during their first six years, they 
come up for promotion to associate professor with 
tenure or full professor (depending on their depart-
ment) in their eighth year.


If the candidate passes an internal departmental 
review, the department puts together an application 
that it brings before the Tenure and Promotions Com-
mittee for the candidate’s general area of study: human-
ities, social sciences, biological sciences, or physical 
sciences and engineering. Unlike tenure review at 
many other universities, the committee is comprised 
of senior faculty members, rather than administra-
tors. The application consists of one hundred pages of 
the applicant’s work and a minimum of seven letters 
of review from faculty in the same area of research at 
peer institutions. Gendler reads all of the professor’s 
end-of-semester teaching evaluations and builds a 
report on the candidate’s teaching abilities to present 
to the group.


The members of TAPC vote by secret ballot. In order 
to receive promotion, the applicant needs a majority. 
The content of the discussion is never disclosed to the 
candidate. But the ﬁnal outcome is simple and irrevo-
cable as best I can tell from the chart: “A candidate for 
appointment or promotion to a tenure position, whether 
at the rank of professor or associate professor, must have 
attained scholarly or creative distinction of high quality 
as demonstrated by both research and teaching. Consid-
eration for tenure emphasizes the impact and continuing
