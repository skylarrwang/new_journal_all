ers for U.S. troops during a decade and a half of war. 

After years of protests by Afghan translators, stories of 
SIV applicants getting killed by the Taliban while they 
waited for their visas, and fears that the program would 
end when coalition combat forces withdrew, Congress 
expanded the total allotment of SIVs by four thousand 
in 2014. But this addition has not made the bureaucracy 
move faster. By late March 2015, more than thirteen 
thousand Afghan applicants were still waiting for their 
paperwork to be processed. 

Like many interpreters, Noori hoped that his work 
would enable him to have a comfortable life in the U.S, 
with a shot at a professional degree. But, as he balances a 
job at a deli and English coursework at Gateway Commu-
nity College, he is struggling to reach this goal. 

We meet at Gateway one fall evening, where he is 
working on homework following a day of classes. After 
greeting me with a wide smile and a handshake, he 
tells me how he conﬁgures his schedule so that he can 
work and attend classes part-time. He hopes his educa-
tion will prepare him for better jobs in the U.S. 

David Williams, the American civilian advisor for 
whom Noori was an interpreter, believes that young 
Afghan men like Noori become interpreters partly 
because they want to come to the U.S. When Noori 
found out he was being resettled in New Haven, Wil-
liams helped him ﬁnd the city on a map and tried 
to give him an idea of his soon-to-be home. “I knew 
the background of New Haven and Yale University,” 
Williams says. “And I was like, Noori, I’m telling you 
brother... look where they sent [you]: to the hub of 
one of the best universities in the world. Maybe or 
maybe not you go there, but you’re gonna be in that 
environment and just being in that environment, 
you’re gonna grow.” 

But between a full schedule of work and school, 
along with the stress of worrying about his family in 
Afghanistan, Noori’s reality has been far removed from 
Yale. His only exposure to the University has been 
through a College alum, assigned as a cultural com-
panion by the Integrated Refugee and Immigrant Ser-
vices (IRIS). 

Williams, who worked at the Afghan National Police 
(ANP) Command Center in Kabul, estimates that he’s 
worked with hundreds of interpreters, and Noori was one 
of two for whom he decided to write a letter of recommen-
dation. He remembers Noori as “very educationally-ori-
ented” and well respected among their colleagues. The 
two worked side-by-side, advising high-ranking Afghan 
ofﬁcials who were training the ANP. 

“They’re essential to the police mission,” Williams 
says of his interpreters. “How do you communicate with 
this [Afghan ofﬁcial] without a language assistant?”

In New Haven, Noori lives alongside other former 
interpreters who are struggling to make lives for them-
selves. As we stand in the kitchen, his ﬂatmates pile out 
of the car carrying groceries, and we walk out of the 
house to meet them. Noori grasps the hand of each 
man in greeting and introduces me to his cousin, 
Ahmad Fawad, who is slightly shorter and more out-
spoken than Noori. He has light wrinkles on the cor-
ners of his eyes. Also unmarried, Fawad came to the 
U.S. alone. 

After decades of war that ravaged the country’s infra-
structure, Fawad says that facilitating the work between 
the coalition forces and the ANP was a way to support 
peace. “I wanted to work with them to help my people. 
To have a better life and better security in my coun-
try,” Fawad says. By the time the Taliban took control of 
Afghanistan at the onset of the 1996 civil war, Fawad’s 
family had ﬂed for Kabul. He was out of school for 
seven years, unwilling to submit to the violent author-
ity of teachers in the Taliban-run classroom. 

Fawad recalls a near-death experience when he was 
accompanying an American ﬁrearms team. Before 
entering a shooting range, they detected an Improvised 
Explosive Device (IED) intended for them. Thank-
fully, they were able to avoid it. 

Oftentimes, interpreters are called on to enter high-
risk situations such as these because their language 
skills are indispensible. But the support offered to 
them is far less than what is given to U.S. soldiers and 
veterans, Noori points out. While the U.S. troops that 
the interpreters work with can make upwards of ﬁve 
ﬁgures per year, Noori made 425 dollars each month 
while working with the U.S in Afghanistan. Today, far 
from his family and far from his home, he makes about 
ﬁfteen to sixteen hundred dollars a month He pays 
around 180 dollars per month to share a bedroom with 
three other men in order to cope with the high living 
costs in New Haven. 

EVEN WHILE HE DREAMS  
OF  REUNITING WITH HIS  
FAMILY HERE, HE  CONSIDERS 
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO  
GO BACK TO AFGANISTAN IN  
THE DISTANT FUTURE


Noori claims there is not adequate support for ref-
ugees trying to plan for long-term futures in the U.S. 
In December of 2014, the New Haven Independent 
covered Noori and other interpreters’ grievances with 
IRIS, which is the ﬁrst point of contact for most ref-
ugees or immigrants who come to New Haven. IRIS 
receives funding from the U.S. Department of State, 
Health and Human Services, and an array of private 
companies and churches, but it is often underfunded. 
And with just seven case managers to oversee the two 
hundred refugees IRIS re-settles annually, it is often 
understaffed. The organization allocates a 925-dollar 
lump sum for each refugee to spend in the ﬁrst three 
months, primarily on rent, utilities, and other basic 
necessities, but then refugees are largely on their own. 

Even a good degree from Afghanistan doesn’t count for 
much in the U.S, so former interpreters like Noori have 
to work low-wage jobs. Noori studied for about three 
years at Kabul University in Afghanistan, but he had 
to start his education over again in the U.S. If he con-
tinues his studies at his current pace, he is about two 
years from ﬁnishing his degree. While he is committed 
to succeeding in the U.S, he mentions that some inter-
preters prefer to try their chances in Afghanistan rather 
than struggling here. 

Noori and Fawad stay in contact with their fam-
ilies in Afghanistan over Facebook and Skype and 
wait until the day they bring their families to the 
U.S. The SIV program issues visas only to the princi-
pal applicant, their spouse, and unmarried children 
under 21 years old, but not to applicants’ fathers, 
mothers, or siblings. After five years of living in the 
U.S, interpreters can use the green cards they are 
issued to bring their families. Noori’s parents, two 
brothers, and two sisters are currently waiting for 
him to bring them to the U.S, the fear of reprisal 
from the Taliban looming over them.  

Even while he dreams of reuniting with his family 
here, he considers what it would be like to go back to 
Afghanistan in the distant future, perhaps with a doc-
torate that would enable him to work as a minister or a 
member of parliament. Maybe he would join the U.S. 
military to work both in Afghanistan and gain the ben-
eﬁts of being a U.S. soldier. For now, the Afghanistan 
that Noori, Fawad, and the other interpreters hope to 
see is not within reach. Nor is the life that they expected 
in the U.S., where they’ve now had to suspend their 
dreams. Despite these disappointments, Noori says that 
he would work with U.S. forces again if he could. 

Noori and his housemates wash a plate of apples 
from the recently bought groceries, insisting that 
I take at least one for the moment and another for 
the way home. They seem to have formed their own  
family in this small apartment, bonded by a common 
language and the daily grind. They stand around the 
kitchen, exchanging jokes and helping each other 
prepare food, doing what they can to achieve a sem-
blance of normalcy. 

Despite the support of his New Haven family, Noori 
is always worried about the tenuous situation with his 
family back home in Afghanistan. “My family, they’re 
really under serious threat right now, so it’s very chal-
lenging for me to be here,” Noori says. “All of my mind 
is back home.”
