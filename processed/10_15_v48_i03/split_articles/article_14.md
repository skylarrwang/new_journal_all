Afghan interpreters face the costs of political refuge

as we walk down the unlit hallway of his apartment 
near West River Memorial Park in New Haven, Reza 
Noori allows me just a glance into the bedroom that he 
shares with two other men. Their mattresses lie edge-
to-edge on the ﬂoor. Smiling shyly, he pushes back his 
full, black curls. He’s tired from his day of work at a 
deli in Westport, bookended by an hour-long commute 
in rush hour trafﬁc. “What I am earning here, this is 
not enough for me to live, spend for college, and also 
support my family. So my living conditions are not 
good, but I live with that. It is okay,” Noori says. 

After working as a translator for the United States 
armed forces in Afghanistan, Noori was one of eigh-
teen recipients of the U.S. Special Immigrant Visa 
(SIV) bound for New Haven. Established in 2009, 
the visa program aids Afghan and Iraqi nationals who 
worked for U.S. forces in their home countries. In 
order to receive an SIV, Noori had to prove that he 
was employed by the U.S. forces for at least one year 
and had experienced serious threats due to this service. 
Letters of recommendation attested to his four years of 
hard work.  

“When you’re working for Americans, when you risk 
your life, you’re under threat every second, every time, 
every day, every morning, every night,” Noori says. “You 
can’t trust anybody, you can’t trust your neighbors, you 
can’t trust even your relatives because they can be in 
connection with the Taliban.” 

Noori received his visa through the SIV program in 
2013, two years after applying, because the background 
checks of the Department of State and the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security take a prohibitively long 
time. Between 2009 and 2013, Congress authorized 
7,900 Afghan visas through the SIV program, but due 
to political backlog, only around two thousand were 
issued. According to the Associated Press, a diplomatic 
cable sent by U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry in 
2010 voiced a fear that “the SIV program could drain 
[Afghanistan] of our very best civilian and military part-
ners: our Afghan employees.” Eikenberry also proposed 
to make the legal standard of “ongoing serious threat” 
more stringent, making it harder to issue SIVs. 

The U.S. government does not release the number 
of SIV applicants, but in total, ﬁfty thousand Iraqis 
and Afghans are estimated to have worked as interpret-
