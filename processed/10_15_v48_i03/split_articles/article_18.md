I have no problem saying a Spanish-dubbed 50 Som-
bras de Grey turned me on last night—though my 
learned vocabulary hadn’t yet covered “vaginal fis-
ting”—but I don’t want to be conquered, or some-
one’s conquest, or even claimed, I don’t think. I 
don’t have the right language for the thing I’ve been 
feeling lately. It’s attraction, and intimacy, maybe; 
the word loaded comes to mind, as does potent, 
or ripe, though not mature. I understand it mostly 
as this strange desire to purge. Can I give you my 
writing? My drawing? My talking? Is it bringing you 
closer? This weekend there were so many things I 
had to keep myself from texting him. Thirty-four is 
Paloma’s lucky number, too. The colors in Ronda 
are incredible. Are you free tomorrow? I landed on 
what Simon from Belgium told me in the hostel in 
Sevilla: During the marathon of Marrakesh they give 
the runners oranges and dates at the checkpoints. Last 
night I got home and wrote down that I felt like a 
bowl of grapes. What does that mean? Purple and 
wet, and also dry? Tart, suede-skinned? Pluckable? 
I don’t know, but now I’m touching my collarbone, 
and the question is how much he wants to see, and 
whether that will be more or less in an hour. How much 
of myself can I give to you? How much will you take?
