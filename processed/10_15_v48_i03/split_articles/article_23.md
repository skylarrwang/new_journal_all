“get in, guero [white boy], it’s cold out here,” said Dan-
iel Mendieta, naked in the mountain air. He leaned 
out of the temazcal built at the edge of the cornﬁeld. 
The sweat lodge, bathed in crisp moonlight, had been 
in the family’s backyard for generations—it was the 
site of their monthly puriﬁcation steam baths. I un-
dressed, placed my clothes on a dusty wooden chair, 
and crawled into the candlelit opening.

Inside, Daniel threw a shallow bowl of water into the 
black hole of an antechamber in the corner of the lodge. 
The charred wooden logs within released a sooty vapor. It 
pulled on my skin with a familiar wet heat. My communi-
ty, the Piscataway Indian Nation in Maryland, has a simi-
lar puriﬁcation practice. This guero was an inﬁltrado—an 
undercover Indian.

“In the old days, only the gods were allowed to bathe 
in the temazcal,” Daniel said, kneeling next to me. “Now 
we are allowed.” Since European contact, the gods of this 
remote town in the highlands of Tlaxcala, Mexico, are 
composites: traditional ﬁgures like the mother goddess 
Tonantizin have been syncretized with Catholic saints, 
such as La Virgen de Guadalupe. Principal in the town 
of San Francisco Tetlanohcan is, of course, the beloved 
patron San Francisco de Asis, who dwells in the parochial 
church in the central square, a ten-minute walk from the 
Mendieta house.

A temazcal crouched behind most of the houses I vis-
ited in the farming town in Mexico’s smallest state, Tlax-
cala. Though it was one of the ﬁrst footholds of Catholi-
cism in the country, the state preserved many of its older 
rituals. People like Daniel, a 21-year-old courier for the 
state government building, have kept the traditions alive. 
Nowadays, however, most of the ten thousand residents 
of Tetlanohcan don’t use their sweat lodges, Daniel ex-
plained between heaves of steamy breath. “People get 
embarrassed to use the temazcal. They think it’s too hick.”

Outside, corn stalks creaked in the cold mountain 
breeze and the pigs snored. Inside the one-story Mendie-
ta house, where I stayed during my time in Tetlanohcan, 
the rest of the family ﬁlled the house with activity. Dan-
iel’s father, Bernardo, and his youngest brother, Aldo, 18, 
browsed the Spanish offerings on Netﬂix; his sister Elena, 
23, reheated mole and tortillas; Daniel’s young wife and 
baby son sat on the ground clapping hands, and his sister 
Jackie, 19, video-chatted their older brother Francisco—
who lives in New Haven, Connecticut.

Francisco and his two siblings made the perilous trip 
North when he was 16 years old. He followed in the foot-
steps of over a thousand other Tetlanohquences who have 
come to New Haven since the 1980s. Roughly ﬁfteen 
percent of the town’s population lives here—some with 
documentation, some without. Tetlanohcan’s migrants 
naturally choose a location where they have relatives and 


friends, who offer job opportunities and a social network. 
Now, the remittances from Francisco’s job at a restaurant 
in Orange, Connecticut, pay for the screen that allows 
him to talk to his sister. They pay for his siblings’ edu-
cation and some of their food. They also subsidize his 
father’s traditional campesino lifestyle in a globalizing 
economy stacked against small-town farmers, especially 
those in largely indigenous communities.

New Haven’s Mexican population is a huge presence 
in the city. Traditional music plays on the streets in Fair 
Haven and the Hill, Mexican-run businesses dominate 
the neighborhoods, and the immigrant communities in-
ﬂuence the city’s political landscape. Tetlanohcan is the 
town that shows most acutely what has happened to the 
places they have left behind. While people have streamed 
in from other cities in Tlaxcala and the neighboring me-
tropolis of Puebla, from no other town has New Haven 
lured a comparably signiﬁcant fraction.

The money that migrants wire home is a complex 
force—it separates families and ushers in a corrosive 
American consumerism, all the while propping up Tet-
lanohcan’s traditional practices and allowing the town to 
survive economic shifts. For the young Mendietas, this 
contradiction is just normal life in Tetlanohcan, as they 
and others who have tilled the land for millennia work to 
hold their lost brothers and sisters close.

Over the course of the week, Elena Mendieta spreads 
her clothes in the grass to dry under the sun, draws water 
from the well to wash the dishes, and makes tortillas by 
hand from corn grown on her family plot. The crop is 
notably absent from the bouquet of produce sold at the 
weekly farmers’ market that takes up the entire central 
plaza, simply because everyone has a lot of it already. 
Corn used to be the main currency in Tetlanohcan, ex-
changed by the kilo for other goods. Since the market 
value of the crop has dropped, only the most dedicated 
farmers get up at dawn every week to barter with corn. 
Many just store the corn for themselves or sell it to the 
government for a few cents per kilo.

The Mendieta siblings grew up in a post-NAFTA world, 
one formed by the 1994 trade agreement that many say 
accelerated the destruction of the campesino lifestyle in 
Mexico and forced a consumer culture on people who 
had previously been self-reliant. Studies published in the 
wake of NAFTA showed a sharp drop in domestic corn 
sales in Mexico as larger buyers switched over to newly 
subsidized imported U.S. corn, starving rural and indige-
nous communities across the country. But in Tetlanohcan, 
Jackie says, there is only Mexican corn—blue, white, yel-
low, and sweet. “Why would we import our corn?” she 
laughs, bewildered, shaking a tall corn out of the sea of 
swaying stalks.

“When I was a little girl, I used to run through the corn 
stalks and feel the leaves tickle my face,” she said. “They 
grab your clothes a bit, and it feels funny.”

Corn is no longer proﬁtable, so many Tetlanoquences 
start family side businesses to support their farms—ﬂoor-
ing is the region’s most popular trade. And families rely on 
remittances sent home by relatives in the U.S. The mon-
ey puts TVs and cable in the humble concrete-ﬂoored 
living rooms; it sends siblings to school and university; it 
makes sure families have better clothes and three meals  
a day.    

“We used to only eat two meals a day, just something 
very small, beans and tortillas. Not a lot but that’s how it 
was,” said Francisca Rosette, gesturing toward her court-
yard in a disjointed low-ceilinged house. “We never used 
to have houses like this. Now [some people] are even 
building two-story houses here.”

The workers in New Haven, who may never return to 
their Tetlanohcan, are a spectral force in their hometown. 
Their vacated homes, ostentatious for the town but still 
smaller than the average house in the Connecticut sub-
urbs, often remain unoccupied. These dwellings repre-
sent the promise of homecoming that can take decades to 
realize, and the money that goes towards expanding each 
home sometimes fails to arrive. By the polluted pond on 
a foothill of La Malintzin, the construction of a huge 
neoclassical concrete mansion was put on hold when 
the owner was laid off his construction job in New York. 
Young men now steal and resell bricks from the unstable 
shell of his palace.

Back in Jackie’s yard, she tells me about the social issues 
that come with the imported cash. Unemployment remains 
high, as does crime. Corn is no longer just the staple of agri-
cultural life. “At night, the corn makes me nervous because 
robbers hide between the stalks along the road.” She point-
ed with her lips at a dilapidated shack in a cornﬁeld by her 
house. Dogs wrestled in the front and two men in tank tops 
stared at something far beyond us.

“Those are thieves,” she said.

The men and others like them illustrate the great social 
risk associated with leaving one’s children behind, even 
with the objective of providing for them from afar. Lu-
cia Rosette, another woman in Tetlanohcan, explained 
the problem this way: with their own children and other 
responsibilities to care for, relatives can’t always provide 
the same care as a child’s parents, so generations of youth 
grow up unsupervised. She sees too many tired abuelos 
and too many of their grandchildren joining gangs, com-
mitting violence in the town, and becoming alcoholics, 
potheads, or drug addicts—several women interviewed 
corroborated the social shift anecdotally. Over chipping 
murals and political ads, “La Maﬁa” is tagged in bright 
orange on many prominent walls.
