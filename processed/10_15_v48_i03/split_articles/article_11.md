a system to get to the same water quality.” Nationally, the 
Environmental Protection Agency estimates that replac-
ing our forest ecosystems with engineered ﬁlters would 
cost more than 270 billion dollars.  

In the early 1800s, only thirty to forty percent of the 
region remained forested after waves of settlers made 
their mark. But as the country expanded, farmers aban-
doned their plots when they couldn’t compete with crops 
shipped by rail from the Midwest. Urban planners leapt 
at the chance to protect watersheds, purchasing vast tracts 
of land to ensure their preservation. Today, thick woods 
cover about seventy-ﬁve percent of New England—a sur-
prising comeback driven in part by the economic forces 
often seen as anathema to conservation efforts.

After my visit, I spoke with Julius Pasay, the manager 
of the University forest system, in order to learn about 
what lies ahead for Myers Forest. Pasay makes executive 
decisions about the composition of the plots of land. He 
keeps Myers Forest as healthy as he can but he isn’t trying 
to return it to its “natural state” from before human con-
tact. “What is a natural state?” Pasay said. “People have 
been interacting with the forests of New England for tens 
of thousands of years, and the distribution and migration 
patterns of species have been changing ever since the last 
ice age.” 

The biggest changes in forest’s composition have been 
caused, unsurprisingly, by humans. Pasay told me about 
the chestnut blight started by a fungus from a Japanese-im-
ported plant. It killed forty billion trees in the early 1900s. 
“These trees were everywhere, and you could just eat 
chestnuts right off of them.” He paused for a moment, 
thinking. “What would society be like if we still had those 
trees, if everyone had free access to food?” 

Thoughts like this inform some of his most audacious 
plans for Myers Forest. Pasay has just ﬁnished planting 
an experimental “agroforest,” a network of different fruit 
and nut trees that has the potential to provide valuable 
habitats for threatened species and increase food yield. I 
asked him when he’ll know how successful he’s been, and 
he laughed. “Maybe in ten or twenty years? That’s the 
difference between agriculture and forestry—you work on 
a timescale of decades. I don’t mind, though. It feels like 
you’re paying it forward.”
