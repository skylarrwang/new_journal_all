EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
At the Mendieta household, this back-and-forth be-
tween cultures takes place in their grandmother’s kitchen, 
where people speak a mix of Nahuatl and Spanish. They 
call it “speaking Mexican.” As we ate chiles enogadas (a 
fried sweet stuffed pepper) Jackie, who learned Nahuatl 
at home and at school, was teasing my colonized tongue 
at the kids’ table.
“Pa-no-tzi-no,” she sounded out. “That means good 
day, Sebi.”
“Here, I’ll help you, guero,” her cousin’s boyfriend 
poked at me. “Pah-not-SHEE-noh bro,” he said in his 
best Sean Connery impression. I’d been hearing it all day.
“Stop fucking with me,” I snapped back, only half jok-
ing. “No me chingues.”

Bernardo had sat me down and taught me how to 
curse in Spanish, worried I wouldn’t survive the family if 
I couldn’t defend myself.
“How do you say that in Nahuatl, abuelita?” Jackie asked.
“Chingaduria,” she obliged. Bernardo roared and 
smacked the table.

Jackie is set on making it back to New Haven to visit 
her brothers.
In the family’s cramped kitchen, she broke her sit-
uation down for me while preparing lunch: pipian, a 
creamy stew made from sesame seeds, nopal cactus, pota-
toes, and lots of chiles.
She stared down at the sesame seeds toasting in a dry 
pan, nutty and papery in the thin mountain air, and ex-
plained that CAFAMI, which she and many others quit 
in recent years, isn’t the only way to get a visa to the  
U.S. “It’s just a matter of getting things moving again,” 
she said. “We have to get the women back together and 
ﬁnd something.”

Jackie sliced the nopal cactus paddles with a hunting 
knife as if they were sticks of butter. The chipotle peppers 
were boiling. “Well, the other thing about all this is I’m 
going to university soon, and that puts a sort of hold on 
my ambitions.”  In a way, the life enabled by her brother’s 
remittances will, for the time being, keep them apart.

She started to fry the nopales and potatoes, throwing 
them around the old skillet with a wooden spoon. Then 
she carefully poured the hot sesame seeds, chipotles, cin-
namon sticks, and cloves into a blender. “I just would like 
to visit the United States, spend time with my brothers 
and sister.” The ground spices piled on top of the nopales 
and potatoes, where they quickly simmered into a light 
pink broth, alongside a stack of tortillas handmade with 
corn from the family plot. She tipped back her pink Hol-
lister cap to wipe the sweat from her brow.

At dinner, Jackie calls her brother Francisco from her 
smartphone. For Francisco and other migrants, the only 
way forward was north. There’s a restlessness to the town, 
one that leads people to ask what would happen if they 
left for good. Her brother Daniel is certainly thinking 
about it. But for Jackie, there’s still a future here in Tetla-
nohcan—one that in many ways depends on New Haven.
