THE MURDER TRAIL
The paranormal reanimates a stalled investigation

i  a m  s i t t i n g  in Jillian and Scott Hamilton’s kitchen.  
It is small and crowded with the essentials of home 
life—a blender on the countertop, papers pinned to the 
fridge, plates on a rack. Scott Hamilton lets out a theatri-
cal groan and gives me a weary look.
“So. You like the paranormal, huh?” 

Jillian and Scott certainly do, though they did not get 
much choice in the matter: the supernatural has been 
present throughout their lives. When Scott was 8 years 
old, a ball he was holding rolled out of his hand and into 
the basement of his parents’ home. As he retrieved it, he 
saw a recently deceased neighbor hanging from the raf-
ters. It was a vision, but it looked as real as anything he 
had ever seen. Jillian has twice seen ghosts replay their 
murders for her. Once, when she was touring a house, 
she saw a young woman who had been killed in the mas-
ter bedroom. They do not regard these visions as halluci-
nations: for Jillian and Scott, these occurrences are the 
intersection of the spiritual realm and ours.

Scott works in a Macy’s warehouse and Jillian is a 
seamstress, but their preferred vocation is Family Haunts, 
a paranormal research group dedicated to studying 
these intersections. Connecticut, Scott tells me, is “the 
most haunted state in the country” and, as a result, is 
crowded with paranormal research groups. Like many 
of these groups, Family Haunts investigates hauntings,

from demons to poltergeists; they also have a stake in 
the smaller ﬁeld of demonic possessions. But that is not 
enough to stand out in a paranormal research scene 
that Scott calls “cutthroat,” and where the only currency 
is exposure. As a rule, paranormal research groups do not 
charge for their services. Two years ago, to raise their pro-
ﬁle, Family Haunts started investigating cold cases. They 
have worked on three to date; one was independently 
resolved, and the other two are ongoing. Since March 
of this year, they have been focusing on the murder of 
39 - year - old Dawn DelVecchio. 

On July 23, 2005, DelVecchio was housesitting for a 
friend in East Haddam, Connecticut. After she stopped 
responding to calls, her mother reported her missing on 
July 24. Two days later, police found DelVecchio’s asphyx-
iated body in an upstairs closet of her friend’s house. 
The police investigated, but no arrest was ever made. 
No suspects were ofﬁcially named, and little informa-
tion about the murder is publicly available. The detec-
tive in charge, Jeff Payette, would only tell me it was an 
“active investigation.” 

The family was devastated; her mother had a nervous 
breakdown and fell into depression. Lenny Paquette, 
DelVecchio’s uncle, felt he was the only one who could 
seek closure for DelVecchio and her family. He has been 
doing so for ten years, talking to the media as the family’s 
spokesman, asking online for information about the mur-
der, and meeting with police. 

“I love Dawn,” Paquette said. “I would pull out all the 
stops until I leave here to ﬁnd out who did it.”

Paquette has always believed in the supernatural—he 
consulted with a sensitive (a psychic, in layman’s terms) 
during the period when DelVecchio was reported miss-
ing, and he describes paranormal experiences as one of 
his “journeys in life.” But Paquette also believes there are 
many supernatural charlatans, so when he saw Scott post-
ing online about his paranormal cold-case task force, he 
was interested but skeptical. They met for the ﬁrst time in 
March. When Paquette meets a sensitive for the ﬁrst time, 
he divulges nothing, making the sensitive prove his or her 
skills. He did so with Jillian, who is an empathic sensitive, 
one highly attuned to other people’s thoughts. She started 
describing DelVecchio and the murder with startling 
accuracy, saying, for example, that she felt DelVecchio 
was “imprisoned” by her home life. 

“I was like ‘yes, yes, yes,’” Paquette recalls, snapping his 
ﬁngers with each yes. “No one would know that.”

Paquette was convinced Family Haunts was the real 
deal; Scott and Jillian felt there was enough material for 
an investigation. They have been working together since. 
On a night in May of this year, they carried out a paranor-
mal investigation at DelVecchio’s gravesite. Scott took pic-
tures and recorded video. Jillian, with a tape recorder run-
ning, asked DelVecchio’s spirit questions. Afterwards, Scott 
pored over these, looking for any trace of the supernatural. 
“Can you give us a sign you’re here? What happened? Is 
there anything you want to communicate with your family?” 
They were hoping to get responses, which in the busi-
ness are called Electronic Voice Phenomena, or EVP. 

An audio professional processed the recordings from 
the cemetery, and Paquette and Scott think there is a 
voice—maybe DelVecchio’s—responding, saying “gener-
ator room.” There was a generator room in the home of 
one of the people Scott and Paquette suspect of commit-
ting the murder. 

Of the pictures they took, they say one stands out: it is 
like any photo of a cemetery at night, with shadowy trees 
and headstones, but superimposed over two of the trees, 
Paquette and Scott see the faces of DelVecchio and one 
of her children.  

I never got to see the picture or hear the recordings. 
It would be easy to be cynical about all this, to dismiss 
digital artifacts and distorted audio and conﬁrmation bias. 
I could roll my eyes and say that ghosts don’t exist and 
talk about the reality TV show to which every paranormal 
researcher aspires. But when I look at Paquette, who car-
ries on the investigation out of his love for DelVecchio, or 
when I think of Scott going to cemeteries in the night and 
poring over the tapes afterwards, I set aside any cynicism. 
I think about the death of a loved one, about a universe 
that is just atoms bumping together in the void, and I wish 
I could see the visions, discern the faces among the trees, 
hear the voices rising out of the grey noise.
