Churches that emphasize per-
sonal salvation without addressing 
the social and political needs of 
their congregations come under 
attack from highly-involved pastors 
like Cofield, Edmonds, and Justice. 
"You can't board in Heaven and live 
on Earth," said Justice. 

But differences over how one 
gets to Heaven may be the biggest 
obstacle to the effectiveness of the 
black church as a political force. 
T he black church is divided among 
many denominations-the three 
major African Methodist congrega-
tions, the two major Baptist ones, 
the Pentecostals, the Episcopalians, 
the Catholics, and so on. "We have 
a racial loyalty," argues one pastor, 
"that transcends denomination." 

But the divergent personal agendas 
of individual pastors often hinders 
united action on broad social 
issues. 

"If they all acted in concert, 
they could turn things around," 
argued Slie. Nevertheless, he added, 
"T he problem is bigger than the 
church." Surrounded by immense 
social problems, black churches 
strive to offer spiritual as well as 
practical solutions for their congre-
gations. Whether or not they suc-
ceed entirely, by trying, they remain 
places of refuge and hope. 

Th~ last song is sung, the last 
prayer prayed. The churchgoers g~t up 
from th~ir p~ws-the men put on 
th~ir hats, th~ wom~n th~ir coats. As 
thq l~av~. th~y shake hands, hug, 
and smil~. asking each how th~ oth" 
is doing. The smu of warmth, of 
community, spills out onto th~ strut 
as the faithful disperu, amidst the 
strains of a gospel hymn.
