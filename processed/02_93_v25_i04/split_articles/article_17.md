regular beats on foot. Their job 
includes meeting with neighborhood 
residents to determine the sensitive 
areas and issues of their beat, and then 
working with a supervisor to come up 
with solutions. "Community-based 
policing is a change to a more proac-
tive approach," said Ass is tan t Police 
Chief James Perotti. "When police are 
that involved in their beat, they know 
what's going on and that earns them a 
lot of support." Officers on patrol even 
have beepers with numbers that they 
can give to the people on their beat. 
Eventually, the university plans to use 
the system around the clock. 

With community-based polic-
ing has come another inno-
vation that seeks to ease 
tensions between police and commu-
nity-renewed emphasis on sensitivity 
training. The police department 
claims that every new officer receives 
such training, which includes day-long 
seminars on how to handle the myriad. 
issues that arise in a diverse communi-
ty, such as hate crime and harassment. 
Some police have sought to reach out 
to Yale's black students in more direct 
ways as well. Even before community-
based policing started, a few of the 
black officers on the Yale police force 
spent time in the Afro-American 
Cultural Center getting to know stu-
dents. 

The police departm ent's attempts 
to address black students' concerns 
have not gone unnoticed. "It's gotten a 
lot better since freshman year, since 
they started the community-based 
policing and the sensitivity training," 
said Poteat. "The police are getting to 
know people within the community." 
In general, black students point to a 
measurable improvement in the pat-
tern of their interactions with police. 
"Freshman year, I had some problems 
with police," said Mangum. "But this 
year, they've been a lot more friendly 
and personable." 

Changes in police training and 
procedure point the way to steps for 
improving race relations among stu-
dents as well. Some black students 
would like to see sensitivity workshops 
on race for incoming students, along 
the lines of the safety and alcohol dis-
cussions that first-year students now 
attend. Next semester, the Black 
Student Alliance at Yale (BSAY) plans 
tg sponsor a forum on harassment, 
open to students of all colors, with 
police and university officials. BSAY 
hopes to raise awareness among white 
students who may not have given a lot 
of thought to their own behavior. 

Flemming Norcott, an Associate 
Justice of the Connecticut Supreme 
Court who teaches the political science 
course Blacks and the Law, supports 
BSAY's stategy. He advises frustrated 
students to organize if they want 
change. "The university is certainly 
responsible for taking more affirmative 
steps towards solution-making," said 
Norcott. "Som etimes they may be 
slower than we want them to be, but 
that doesn't mean we can't try to push 
them." 

Norcott believes that as an aca-
demic community, the university 
offers a unique opportunity for work-
ing toward easing racial tensions. "The 
university is fertile ground, maybe the 
most fertile in the world, for resolving 
misunderstandings rationally," he said. 
"If we can't do that at the university, 
then where can we? This is the perfect 
place for attempting to understand 
each other." 

Black students also speak of creat-
ing such an environment of under-
standing. On the personal level of day-
to-day interaction, they call on white 
students to recognize their actions 
and consider the reasons behind 
them. "If every student acknowledges 
that yes, I did hesitate, or look at you 
funny, o r decide not to open the 
gate, it would help," said Bishop. "It 
doesn't mean you're a worse person, 
just that you've learned the lesson 
well. If you don't acknowledge the 
problem you'll never stop doing 
those things to people . .,, 

Black students also believe that 
whites need to address the way in 
which racially-based suspicion affects 
their attitudes toward blacks who live 
outside the walls of Yale. They claim 
that the widely-held assumption that 
black New Haven residents commit 
most of the crime on. campus is mis-
placed. "I really think that if people 
would stop watching the black peo-
ple who are walking around Yale and 
start watching their roommates and 
hallmates, they would find out where 
their things are going," said Bishop. 
"The general public doesn't have the 
kind of access to Yale to steal all the 
things that get stolen." 

As they look toward the future, 
black students hope to pass much of 
the responsibility for change to white 
students and theÂ·Yale administration. 
Although they may support efforts 
like BSAY's symposium, most black 
students don't want to spend a large 
part of their undergraduate years 
educating those around them. 

Instead, they put most of their ener-
gy into making their own experience 
of life on campus the best it can be. 
"I don't like the looks I get or the 
way people react to me sometimes, 
but I don't feel like it's going to 
change 
anytime 
soon," 
said 
Mangum. "I do what I can to stop it, 
but I have to do what I came to do 
here. I can't let this stuff get in my. 
way."
