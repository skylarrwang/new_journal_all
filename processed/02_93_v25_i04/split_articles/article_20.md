ian-American students who date interracially are 
bombarded by competing pressures. On one side lie 
acial stereotypes. On the ocher stands the disap-
proval of fellow Asian-Americans, many of whom believe 
that members of their community should date exclusively 
within their ethnic group. 

A recent article in GQ maga-
zine calls the Asian-American 
woman "the ultimate accesso-
ry." Statements like these 
contribute co the image of 
Asian-American women as 
submissive and sexually pas-
sive, says an Asian-American 
student. 

" People think that 
they're the perfect sex partners," 
she said, adding that some men deliber-
ately seek out Asian-American women for that reason. 
"They have Asian woman fetishes. In my Japanese lan-
guage classes I met men who talk abo t 'conquering Japan' 
and how they want 
to 
marry 
Japanese 
women," 
she 
said 
"They;

w 
they'd 
e a II y 
like to go 
work 
tn 
Japan 
and 
meet geisha. 
This is typical 
fare from white 
guys in the classroom." 

Awareness of these pre-
conceptions has created suspi-
cion in the minds of some Asian-
American women. "I'm wary 
because I'd rather not be objectified," 
said Anne Lin (ES '95). Her caution 
extended to the initial stages of her pre-
sent interracial relarionsrup. "I wasn't sure if 
18 THÂ£ NEW JouRNAL 
he liked me because of me, or because I 
was Asian," she said. 

Jack Hasegawa, general secretary of Dwight Hall, notes 
an imbalance in the gender ratio of interracial couples, 
blaming the pressures put on men to iniriate dating for the 
fewer number of Asian-American men who date outside of 
their race. "There's an external message from white society 
that says, 'We're not sure about you, we don't want you to 
cross the racial line in dating,"' he said. "For an Asian-
American woman to go out with a white guy means she got 
asked. But if an Asian-American guy goes around asking 
white girls out, you're going to run into trouble." 

Lin attributes the imbalance to society's conventional 
measures of attractiveness. "I think Asian-American women 
fit the white standard of beauty more perfecdy than Asian 
men because most Asian women are petite with small bone 
structure and high cheek bones," she said. "But Asian men 
are generally smaller chan white men, and that wouldn't be 
considered as beautiful." 

The mainstream media has translated the physical char-
acteristics of the Asian-American male into a prototype of 
asexuality, explained Quentin Lee (GRD '93). A director of 
several independent fUms, Lee counters the desexualization 
of the Asian-American male in Anxi~ty of ln~prmion and 
th~ Oth~rn~ss Machin~. In his film, Lee presents the Asian-
American man as one who wants and enjoys sex by tracing 
his relationship with his biracial male lover. "My video 
responds to the mainstream media desexualization of the 
Asian male," he said. "Asian males are portrayed in rather 
desexualized roles, which obviously creates a sense of anxi-
ety and a need to become resexualized in the western mas-
culine stereotype." 

But Lee's film practically stands alone. Hollywood pro-
ductions rarely focus on the love interests of Asian-
American male characters. Hasegawa points to Th~ Karau 
Kid movie series as one of Hollywood's recent attempts to 
tread the ground of Asian-American romance. The 
moviemakers suddenly imbue the previously asexual Mr. 
Miagi with a desire for romance, but only after he returns to 
his native Japan. "In order for him to have a love interest, 
they have to fly him from Los Angeles to Okinawa to meet a 
woman who greets him wearing a kimono. If you've ever been 
to Okinawa, you'd know that the number of women who 
wear kimono is very small. But it's the only way that Pat 
Morita can have a relationship with a woman," said 
Hasegawa, a Japanese-American who has himself challenged
