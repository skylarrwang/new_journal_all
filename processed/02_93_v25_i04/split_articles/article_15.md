L
ike other immigrants who have made America their 
home, Latinos have come to the United States seeking 
a bener way of life. In the cities, they search for jobs, 
housing, and education. But many obstacles plague their 
American dream. The formidable language barrier is just 
the beginning of a s~ries of other difficulties: lack of effec-
tive education, scarce employment, and discrimination. 

Several different Latino nationalities share the same 
ethnic label on the census, but only Puerto Rican 
immigrants can claim automatic citizenship. Despite the 
potential divisiveness of this distinction, Puerto Ricans and 
other Latinos in New Haven have come together to form 
service and political organizations, to combat their shared 
difficulties and disappointments, and to serve their commu-
nity's needs. 

New Haven Latinos, who make up 13 percent of the 
city's population, primarily consist of Puerto Ricans and 
Mexicans, with other Latin Americans in smaller numbers, 
such as Colombians, Salvadorans, and Peruvians. Puerto 
Ricans, U.S. citizens since 1917, make up 80 percent of the 
Latino population, with 17,000 residents; Mexicans, the 
next largest and fastest growing group, cannot be accurately 
accounted for, since many are illegal aliens that standard 
population measures do not include. Estimates of their 
numbers vary from one to ten thousand. "New Englanders 
are still trying to figure out what a Mexican looks like. They 
think we are all Puerto Ricans," said Angel Fernandez, 
board member of Latino Youth Development. "The white 
community in New Haven doesn't know the difference, 
doesn't recognize the diversity in the Latino population." 

Stereotypes can overshadow the lives of Latinos with 
Hollywood images, according to Valeriano Ramo (ES '81), 
director of the Casa Cultural Julia de Burgos (Puerto Rican 
Cultural Center). "Puerto Ricans are seen as hot-tempered, 
fighting each other all the time, carrying switchblades-like 
in ~st Sid~ SUJry," he said. "Mexicans are seen as docile, 
lazy, unwilling to work." Ramos bemoans the effect that 
such generalizations have upon his community. "You can 
just imagine what it's like to be misunderstood in this way 
by the dominant white culture." 

Puerto Ricans have been coming to northern cities like 
New Haven in search of employment since the 50s, often 
shuttling back and forth between Puerto Rico and the 
States. Mexicans began the journey north in the 80s in 
search of plentiful factory jobs. Although the jobs eventual-
ly dried up, the flow of immigrants did not, and many

found themselves unemployed, sometimes without skills or 
citizenship, often without knowledge of English. 

Puerto Ricans, who have run service agencies for 
decades in New Haven, found themselves with neighbors 
who spoke their language but who had different customs, 
and little access to government services. Puerto Ricans have 
many advantages as U.S. citizens, including access towel-
fare and other social programs, and the freedom to return to 
Puerto Rico at will. But as Latinos, they also face linguistic 
and cultural barriers that separate them &om white society. 
"Latinos are not just bilingual, they are also bicultural," 
said Fernandez. Sharon Mackwell, director of Centro San 
Jose, agrees. "Aside from the language difficulties, the cul-
tural mores are different," she said. "Latin Americans look 
for trust and loyalty, for personal relations with people they 
can trust in the schools and the government." 

Existing agencies have expanded to fill gaps by shifting 
their target groups and services to handle the needs of a 
changing community. To accommodate the influx of Latin 
Americans, Puerto Rican agencies have tried to provide ser-
vices to all Latinos, a process currently moving slowly but 
surely according to Dennis Hart, director of Latino Youth 
Development. "The Puerto Rican community sometimes 
has a reputation in other Latin American countries for 
being difficult to get along with and not treating other 
Latinos very well," said Hart. "But now we have to get 
along." 

Programs have evolved to better serve the current needs 
of the community. Latino Youth Development originally 
began as an after-school recreational and educational pro-
gram for Puerto Rican children. When the organization 
opened its doors to all Latinos, it also created services for 
adults, tackling education as well as job-training, referrals, 
advocacy, and counseling for troubled families. "You can't 
help the kids without helping the parents," said Fernandez. 
Latino Youth now serves all Latinos and even some African-
Americans. Its services include distribution of clothing and 
food when available. "Our job is to ease entry into New 
Haven for these people, to help them gain access to ours 
and others' services, to better their lives," said Hart. 

Centro San Jose also began as a Puerto Rican service 
agency in the Fair Haven area, where many Latinos live. 
Centro focuses on educational activities for children and 
adults. In addition, the agency conducts prevention pro-
grams aimed at the family that address drug and alcohol 
abuse, staying in school, and teenage pregnancy. 

"The idea is to get to the parents and kids before these 
things become problems," said director Mackwell. "For 
example, we target our pregnancy-prevention at fourth- and 
fifth-graders. Their ideas about these things are becoming 
concrete at this age. We try to show them that the world is 
not closed to them, that they have options." 

The problem of ineffective or non-existent education 
for native Spanish speakers in the United States leads direct-
ly to employment problems. Many Latinos in New Haven 
do low-skill, low-wage work that offers little chance of 
upward mobility, and non-citizens have no unions or legal 
recourse for poor working conditions. Both Latino Youth 
Development and Centro San Jose provide job training and 
vocational instruction to improve the skills of Latinos, who 
often remain in the 
working class for 
generations. 

With the reces-
sion, a sense of des-
peration 
among 
Latinos has become 
niore evident, says 
Mackwell. 
"The 
combination of a 
language barrier, 
cultural differences, 
and lack of ade-
quate 
education 
make it difficult to 
find employment," 
she said. 

Latinos, as the 
last group to enter 
the work force in 
New Haven, often 
lose their jobs first 
when a factory clos-
es. "Even those with education and skills are out of work," 
says Alderman Eduardo Perez. Many immigrants from 
Latin America who received schooling in their native coun-
tries cannot find work in their fields because of the language 
barrier and must take lower echelon jobs. 

Service agencies offer English-as-a-Second-Language 
(ESL) classes for these clients as well as those stili in school. 
Students in New Haven have also stepped in to help pro-
vide educational services to the community. Latinos at Yale 
work with the New Haven community through Despierto 
Boricua or el Movimiento Estudantil Chicano de Aztlan 
(MEChA), the Puerto Rican and Mexican-American stu-
dent groups on campus. The organizations work together 
on some issues of community outreach, such as their joint 
literacy tutoring program.

"Latinos at Yale have a lot in common with Latinos in~ 
New Haven, despite what many people think," says,! 
Christina Gonzalez (CC '94), member of MEChA. ''A lot~ 
of Latinos at Yale are first or second generation, like the~ 
Latinos in this city." She also feels relatively few class ten-~ 
sions as a student at a prestigious, expensive university.~ 
"The people I meet in New Haven are usually encouraging.\3 
They're pleased that I'm studying and tell me to keep at it."~ 

Language and a need for unity bind the Latinos on~

of our commonalities," says Eva Blanco (CC '94), a mem- ~ 
her of MEChA. "To create power and movement in any '" 
community, Latinos have to unite." 

Increasingly, Latinos in New Haven have united as 
voters. Most recently, 
the city elected its 
third Latino alderman, 
Eduardo 
Perez, 
in 
addition to Alderman 
George 
PerezÂ· 
and 
President of the Board 
of Alderman Tomas 
Reyes Reyes may run 
for mayor of New 
Haven, a testament to 
the greater power that 
Latinos still seek. 
"In the last few 
years, Latinos have 
been voting more, get-
ting more involved," 
said Eduardo Perez. 
"As they become citi-
zens and get more edu-
cated, they become 
more aware of what's 
going on, of their 
responsibilities and their rights." 

In the future, 
Eduardo Perez hopes to see more Latino candidates. 
"Before Reyes, politicians weren't Latinos. Now there 
are many, and I hope there will be many more." 

Puerto Ricans and other Latin Americans have come 
together as service providers and as a voting block, 
rather than dividing along lines of nationality. With the 
possibility of a Latino mayor on the horizon, they may 
be looking at one of the high points of their efforts to 
bring the community together to fight for their ri&il 
and needs.
