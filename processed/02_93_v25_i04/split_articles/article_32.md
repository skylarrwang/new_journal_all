Y
ale provides an interesting microcosm of the world 
today, particularly with respect to issues of race and 
ethnicity. Living and working at Yale, we can easily 
be overwhelmed by the variety of people that make up the . 
university. 

There are women and people of color in class-
rooms at twice the numbers of only 20 years ago. There are 
faculty, administrators, and staff members from a number 
of economic and ethnic backgrounds who provide services 
to the Yale community each day. There are students from 
every nation on the globe. And there are opportunities for 
all students at Yale to travel and gain exposure to myriad 
cultures and political climates. Indeed, we can see and 
experience the history and art of civilizations from ancient 
Egypt to Mexico. We can also hear a variety of music, from 
the Slavic Chorus to the Gospel Choir. 

Yet as we celebrate the life of the Reverend Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr., we must examine the status of our com-
munities of color, and in particular the community of 
African descent, as we set our sights on future goals. We 
must ask ourselves: How far have we come? Are we focused 
on the tasks of succeeding in education, business and cul-
tural expression? Are there more opportunities for us in the 
arenas of politics and corporate business? Are we gerting all 
that we can out of our Yale experience? And finally, are we, 
as people of color, gerring better at dealing wirh issues of 
race and ethnicity in the larger academic community and in 
communities of color? 

T he answers to these questions, which lie ar the root of 
any necessary improvements on issues of race and ethnicity 
at Yale, depend on combined changes within rhe university 
at large and within communities of color. 

First, collectively, we need to reexamine and reclaim 
our images. We can start by looking at how we are defined. 
For example, people of color are not "minorities." There 
are more persons of Asian and Mrican descent on earth 
than anyone else. Our minority status only emerges in the 
context of political control and/or economic power. With 
unified and persistent efforts, we can create a more bal-
anced socio-economic and political arena in which to par-
ticipate. 

We therefore must not define ourselves in 
diminutive terms. lnde~d, we might take a few good clues 
from the emerging identities of the biracial students in our 
midst who refuse to accept one heritage over the other. In a 
show of unity, biracial students claim all of their ethnicities. 
The marriage of their backgrounds is the expression of a -
new unity rather than a fractionalization. 

In addition, people of color who work toward a com-
. mon goal are not separatists. Tables in Commons peopled 
by African-Americans, for example, are no different than 
tables peopled by Exeter alums, Ezra Stiles freshpeople, or 
singing group recruits. Our commonalities and the way we 
celebrate community enhance unity and allow us to build 
lifelong relationships. We affirm and embrace each other 
as we look back to our troubled histories, constructing solu-
tions and responses that will create an empowered future 
for our particular ethnic group and for the country as a 
whole. 

Second, we people of color need to talk amongst our-
selves and get down to the business of establishing our own 
agenda. Our agenda must include more than a good edu-
cation and other opportunities which build a great resume. 
We must learn (in and out of the classroom) the stories of 
our heritages and the text·of our various cultural back-
grounds. In so doing, we must also embrace those within 
the context of our own culture whom we have often set 
aside. Paying closer attention to women's issues in general, 
as well as to those of lesbians and gays, and learning to be 
open to their struggles-whether we agree or not-will fur-
ther our efforts to bolster ourselves for renewal and accep-
tance in our widely diverse ethnic communities. Moreover, 
we must also learn from every other race and ethnicity at 
Yale in an effort to hear one another in the context of

people 
who strug-
gle for recog-
nition and ad-
vancement in a vari-
ety of leaky life rafts 
swimming upstream. 

Finally, we must gather 
together the tools that facilitate 
change on our terms. It is time for 
people of color to develop our own 
resources. It is time to envision ideas and models 
that may or may not rely on large doses of govern-
ment funding and corporate donations. We 
must think of ourselves as "ethnic" legacies who 
are prepared to change our worlds by working 
in the larger society and sharing time, energy 
and affirmations with those in need both inside 
and outside of the university system. As direct 
beneficiaries of human struggle, we can look 
forward to sharing our ideas and solutions with 
our country as it faces an era requiring great sac-
rifice and calling for incredible ingenuity and 
strength of will. 

Many answers exist to the questions of division 
amidst people because of different racial and ethnic tra-
ditions. We as people of color must recogni:u and create 
some of those answers for ourselves. There is no rime left for 
us to allow the privilege of opportunity to remove us from 
the obligation of resourcefulness. The solutions will not 
come down from the mainstream. They are not the authori-
ty. They are not the majority. We have researched the solu-
tion, and we are it. 

In prayerful anticipation, we would like to take this 
opportunity to anticipate change, in the climate of new lead-
ership, both as we await the appointment of a new president

here at Yale and in the wake of the inauguration of a new 
generation of leadership in the White House. In the words 
of our sister Maya Angelou, born and raised twenty-five 
miles from Hope, Arkansas, we find instruction and the 
inspiration as we prepare to talk to ourselves: 

... Here, on the pulse of this new day 
You may have the grace to look up and our 
And into your sister's eyes and into 
Your brother's face, your country 
And say simply 
Very simply 
With hope 
Good morning.
