Lroi jackson (DC '50) was the first black captain of the Yale football team. 
times I had this funny feeling of how different being at Yale 
was for me." 
When Linus Clark became admissions director in the late 60s, 
he brought an entirely new philosophy to minority admissions. 
Clark dramatically increased the number of black students per 
class, favoring black applicants from segregated and urban 
schools who showed academic promise but who would not have 
traditionally received attention. During Clark's tenure, Yale 
also admitted several Asian-Americans in each class and 
became more diverse in both racial and socioeconomic terms. 
After attending a predominantly Jewish high school in New 
York, Willie Coleman (SM '73) had experience with being 
in the minority. When Coleman came to Yale, he expected 
to find a bastion of white male elitism. "I thought I would 
have wealthy roommates," said Coleman. "But my roommates 
were all white middle class. I think that made me 
more comfortable." 
Coleman's year had the largest number of blacks ever in a 
single class. For the first time, black Yalies could form social 
groups in significant numbers. Coleman joined support systems 
for black students like the Afro-American Cultural 
Center and the Black Student Alliance at Yale (BSAY), organizations that gave him a familiar environment. "Most blacks 
felt outside of the cultural mainstream," said Coleman. "It 
was something that you felt every day. It could range from 
how people danced, what people talked about, how they 
dressed, or what they did for vacation. Other black students 
were just the people whom I felt most comfortable with." 
After his freshman year, Coleman changed residential colleges 
so that he could room with a black classmate. 
In the spring of 1970, Coleman's freshman year, racial 
issues dominated the Yale campus. Two members of the Black 
Panthers went on trial for the murder of a police informant, 
and thousands of demonstrators planned to descend on New 
Haven for a rally on May Day. Members of black radical 
groups had threatened to blow up Yale buildings. Violence 
seemed inevitable, and most of Yale's student body didn't 
know how to react. "I think that most white undergraduates 
wanted to be sympathetic," recalled Coleman, "but they were 
just confused by the whole situation." 
The Afro-American Cultural Center became the focal 
point for black students' involvement in the crisis as they 
organized a student strike in support of the Panthers. 
Coleman remembers the tension on campus as he ate breakfast 
with his girlfriend on the morning of May Day. "A 
group of white students were sitting at a table next to us 
and asked us to come over and explain the situation to 
them. We were tired and said 'no.' The white students actually 
got angry at us," said Coleman. "It was as if we owed it 
to them to explain what was going on." May Day passed 
without violence, but in Coleman's view, the crisis did little 
to shake up racial attitudes at Yale. 

This fall the Association of Yale Alumni asked Lroi Jackson to 
speak at a panel discussion at the Yale Club of New York. He 
arrived in New York the day before and stayed the night at the 
Yale Club. Before the meeting, Jackson went to the airport to catch 
a flight home only to find that it had been canceled because of a 
storm. When Jackson returned to the Yale Club, a doorman, 
unaware that Jackson was a Yale alumnus, interrupted him 
before he could reach the check-in desk. The doorman demanded 
to know what Jackson wanted. When Jackson asked for a room, 
the doorman shouted that none were available. Jackson left without 
arguing.
