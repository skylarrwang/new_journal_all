race? Judaic studies professor Paula 
Hyman dismisses such a claim. "Not 
only is it disturbing that race was used 
as a club to destroy Jews," she said, 
"but you just have to go to Israel and 
see Jews not only from Ethiopia but 
from North Africa, the Middle East, 
the Soviet Union, and Western Europe 
to know that Jews do not constitute a 
raJ." 

However, the concept of Jewish 
identity as a product of biology still 
holds for some facers of Jewish prac-
tice. Because Judaism traditionally 
passes from mother to child, anyone 
with a Jewish mother can claim Israeli 
citizenship. Ponet, however, pointed 
out a limitation to using biology to 
define who is Jewish. "You can convert 
to becoming a Jew," he said. "You can-
not convert to becoming an Mrican-
American." 

For many, a common history 
stands as the only strand of Jewish 
identity that all Jews can share. 
"Avraham Enfeld once said that we 
consider that each of us personally 
received the ten commandments on 
Mr. Sinai," Warnick said. Shared 
memory, whether focused on the 
Holocaust, the Biblical Exodus, or 
even the aura of a childhood Passover 
Seder, ties Jews into what Hyman calls 
"a religio-ethnic legacy." 

But some Jews question whether 
the minimalist definition of a people 
linked by history can sustain modern 
Judaism. "Everyone has numerous 
identities, and if I have to prioritize, 
Judaism is the one I would place the 
most faith in," said Peter Beinart (BR 
'93) bur my Jewish identity feels a lit-
tle hollow. I have a much richer grasp 
of the intellectual components of 
being an American than of being a 
Jew." Others wonder whether Jewish 
continuity can rest on symbols of the 
past rather than a vibrant self-perpetu-
ating culture. "In contemporary 
America, secular Jewish identity has no 
structural basis," said Hyman. "We are 
losing touch with the identity of past

generations, which was rooted in a cul-
ture that derived from Eastern Europe 
and was associated with the Yiddish 
language."

n the surface, Yale's Jewish 
community seems to defY any 
dire predictions of total 
assimilation. Ponet sees a positive con-
trast between today's university envi-
ronment and the Yale of his student 
days. "There were many Jews who 
were hidden," he said. "Today's Jewish 
students wouldn't think of shedding 
their Jewishness. It's a responsibility, 
an opportunity, and sometimes a bur-
den. But it's who they are." 

Nevertheless, the few visible 
Jewish campus activities create the illu-
sion that the Yale Jewish community 
has more active members than is actu-
ally the case. Some professors have 
noticed a trend away from broad par-
ticipation. ''A large group of Jews have 
become less involved while a small 
group of students has become more 
involved and more open about the 
assertion of their Jewishness," said 
Hyman. 

The small core of active Jews on 
campus provides the backbone for 
activities that range from the largely 
Jewish fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi, to 
student groups like Yale Friends of 
Israel, to three different versions of 
Shabbat services. However, the majori-
ty of campus Jews do not participate 
in such organizations. "It disturbs me 
that there are perceived to be two 
groups of Jews on campus: secular 
Jews who see themselves as liberal and 
progressive, and those who are far 
more active in the Jewish community 
and more ethnic-centered," Beinart 
said. "I have friends who are still very 
uncomfortable going to the Kosher 
Kitchen because they feel their beliefs 
are not really accepted." 

Some Yalies who feel alienated in 
the HilJel setting express their Jewish 
values in other ways. "I don't think the 
religious life of the colJege is thriving, 
but I think the intellectual Jewish life 
definitely is," said Warnick. Many 
Jews investigate their heritage by tak-
ing courses in Jewish history; others 
express shared political views in the 
Liberal Parry of the Yale Political 
Union. For these Jews, involvement in 
Hillel-sponsored activities does not

adequately measure a sense of identifi-
cation. 

The divisions in Yale's Jewish 
community largely arise from the 
evolving debate over the role that 
minority groups should play in the 
university. At the beginning of the 
century, Jews and white ethnics at Yale 
tried to gain acceptance by mastering 
the curriculum and the extra-curricu-
lar activities already in place. In con-
trast, the succeeding wave of non-
Western ethnic groups began to ques-
tion the very nature of the universiry 
curriculum. Today, secular Jews view 
ethnicity and religion as private mat-
ters, while an emerging group of more 
active and observant Jewish students 
promote the assertive concept of iden-
tity advocated by many students of 
eolor. 

These Jews support increased uni-
versity recognition of Jewish ethnicity. 
Some see the need for a Dean of 
Jewish students to represent the needs 
of Jews and mediate relationships in 
the community, like the other ethnic 
deans. They point out that Jews a_~ 
Yale do not have an activity space lik~ 
the cultural houses or a worship space 
that parallels the churches that Yale 
Christians attend. "Most on-campus 
Jewish activities take place in base-
ments," said Zacks. University dining 
halls also fail to cater to Jewish stu-
dents by not ,routinely providing 
kosher meals, so kosher students must 
eat at the student-run and donation-
supplemented kosher kitchen. "It is 
never easy to be a Jew," said Zacks. 
"But the university makes it harder." 

Others maintain that Jews as a 
group occupy a relatively comfortable 
position in the Yale community. "Jews 
are an established minority at Yale. 
We've arrived," said Ponet. "A minori-
ty by Yale's defmition is a group that is 
economically, socially, politically, and 
therefore educationally suffering and 
impoverished. But we've broken 
through those barriers.'~ 

Some look to the planned Joseph 
fEBRUARY 5â€¢ 1993 
Slifka Center for Jewish Life at Yale, 
scheduled to open in the fall of 1994, 
to bring together the disparate ele-
ments of Yale's Jewish community. "I 
believe it will provide a transformation

j ames Ponet. 
of Jewish life in the most dramatic 
sense," said Ponet. "Corporately we are 
hidden at Yale as Jews. Our center will 
be the place where the living fruits of 
Judaism will be accessible to every-
one." Some students hope the center 
will provide a social focus for Yale's 
Jewish community-a place that will 
be comfortably and inclusively Jewish. 
"There's a lot of fragmentation in the 
communiry because all of the activities 
take place.separately," said Warnick. 
"Having a center will unify the groups 
and maybe people will finally start to 
hang out together." 

The hope, uncertainty, struggle, 
and conflict that Jewish students 
express point to their attempts to con-
struct a modern ethnicity. As Jewish 
students w.resde to find their own 
sense of Jewish identity, some also 
teach classes at the religious school run 
by Yale Hillel. The priorities and 
work of the undergraduate teachers 
provide a clue to the shape that their 
Judaism will take. "We try to give the 
kids a sense of the fun and intellectual 
excitement which is what Judaism 
really should be about," said Adam 
Shear (SY '93). But "what Judaism is 
really about" remains naggingly open-
ended.
