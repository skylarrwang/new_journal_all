In the 1950s, donations from the 
congregation built the modern, 
stone-and-concrete structure chat 
Immanuel Baptist occupies today. It 
boasts a huge meeting room where 
the church's ten choirs practice, where 
the Youth Ministry meets, and where 
the P3ftor, Rev. Curtis M. Cofield, 
hosts a lunch for churchgoers after 
every Sunday service. At present, 
Immanuel Baptist counts nearly 900 
people in its fold. 


First Pentecostal Church of 
C hrist, Inc., on the 
ocher hand, counts 
only six regular adult 
members in its con-
gregation. Founded 
in 
1990, 
First 
Pentecostal is a one-
family congregation. 
Elder Charles G. 
Ashe, his wife and 
children, and a family 
friend, Sister Sandy, 
pray in a low, rectan-
gular wooden build-
ing flecked with peel-
ing aqua paint on 
Newhall Street in 
Newhallville. Elder 
Ashe sits on a broken 
barber's chair in a 
dilapidated barber 
shop beside First 
Pentecostal to read 
the Bible before his 
Sunday service. 


No matrer what 
the size of the congre-
gation, many mem-
bers 
take 
incense 
pride in their church. Their personal 
investment-in fundraising, social 
activities, religious education, and 
community service-may explain the 
remarkable tenacity with which black 
churches have survived and grown 
through the centuries. "The black 
church," said Rev. Sam Slie, founder 
of the Black Church at Yale, "is a 
place where black people can be lead-
ers in their own institution-govern 
it, invest in it their own resources, 
and feel themselves in a community 
that trusts and supports them." 


Many of New Haven's estab-
lished churches began as both 
Immanuel 
Baptist 
and 
Pentecostal did-
under the guidance 
of a few dedicated devout, in tiny 
rooms in houses and meeting places 
across the city, and in extreme pover-
ty. The pastors of these churches 
range from the college-educated ~nd 
the seminary-trained to those who 
are simply inspired by the spirit to 
preach, to pray, and to praise.

The survival and prosperity of any 
black church depends on the character 
of its pastor. As priests, pastors care for 
the spiritual life of their flock. As 
prophets, they challenge the injustices 
of the society in which their congrega-
tions live. And as politicians, each pas-
tor's personal relationship with city 
powerbrokers often determines the fate 
of his church. 


No two figures better illustrate 
the shifting fortunes of black pastors 
than Dr. Edwin S. Edmonds of 
Dixwell United Church of Christ 
(U.C.C.) and Rev. J. Stanley Justice of 
Bethel African Methodist Episcopal 
(A.M.E.). Dr. Edmonds could be 
called an aristocrat of the black com-
munity. As president of the NAACP 
many black-owned businesses. The 
day care center that was once the 
church's pride and joy shut down last 
September after a change in fire codes. 
Angered by what he sees as some black 
ministers' coddling of the Daniels 
administration, Edmonds accuses 
other ministers of "selling their soul 
cheaply" to gain political influence 
and favors. He bemoans the "confiscat-
ed leadership" of the black community.

people whom we can 
turn to any individual

office. ~

congregatzons. 


in Greensboro, North Carolina, dur-
ing the turbulent integration battles of 
the 50s, he survived repeated harass-
ment and a shooting that shattered the 
windows of his house. In 1959, he 
took the pulpit of Dixwell U.C.C., 
New Haven's oldest black church, 
after his wife told him she could no 
longer live in Greensboro. Under his 
care, Dixwell U.C.C. founded a day ,. 
care center, sponsored low-income 
housing units, created a minority 
empowerment corporation, lobbied 
for the creation of a community cen-
ter, and supplied after-school pro-
grams. 


Edmonds' activism and populari-
ty earned him a seat on the school 
board and the ear of the mayor. But 
lately, Edmonds' political fortunes 
have waned. When his deacon, John 
Daniels, ran for ·mayor .in 1989, 
Edmonds remarked, "It will be whitey 
who will decide this election." The 
subsequent uproar over his statement 
caused Daniels to repudiate Edmonds. 
"It was a racist remark, so I had to dis-
tance myself," said Daniels, who is still 
a 
member of Dixwell U.C.C. 
"Edmonds knew better." 


Edmonds disdains as flashy the 
..multitude of choirs and colorful ser-
mons his colleagues offer their congre-
J.~'gations. Dixwell U.C.C. has only one 
choir, in contrast to Bethel's six and 
Immanuel's ten. In the 23 years he has 
been pastor, Edmond's congregation 
has shrunk from 350 to 280 people. 
At the same time, the neighborhood 
around his church has slid deeper into 
the chaos of drugs and violence. "Hard 
times have done us in," he says. "We 
did some good, but it didn't last." 


Not only has Edmonds lost his 
place in the city's power elite, but the 
funds and the support for his pro-
grams have started to dry up. Dixwell's 
minority empowerment corporation 
failed because the capital it had gath-
ered was too miniscule to support 


A few blocks away from Dixwell 
U.C.C. stands Bethel A.M.E. Its pas-
tor, Rev. J. Stanley Justice, is young 
and ambitious. A graduate of the Yale 
Divinity School and a native of the 
North, Justice taught in elementary 
schools and pastored in Bermuda 
before coming to Bethel in 1983. In 
the nine years since he took the pulpit, 
Bethel A.M.E.'s rolls have swelled 
from 300 to 500. Under his care, 
Bethel bought a parsonage and added 
a new wing to the church building. In 
addition, the church has "adopted" 
the Helene Grant School, which lies 
just a block away, and Justice has 
become a primary advocate for the 
elementary school in its dealings with 
the city administration and the school 
board. 


A staunch supporter of Daniels, 
Justice defends the involvement of 
the church in every aspect of the 
community, including the political. 
Justice currently serves as one of the 
city's housing commisioners. "If a 
pastor's doing his job," he says, "he 
will always keep in mind the needs of 
his people." 


New Haven's pastors have band-
ed together to fight for the needs of 
their congregations. The Association 
of New Haven Clergy, made up of 
about 40 black ministers from across 
the city, often functions as an advoca-
cy group to focus city government on 
the needs of African-Americans. At 
present, the Association plans to push 
Science Park executives to hire more 
Mrican-American subcontractors and 
workers in the construction of a new 
Science Park facility. From support-
ing a controversial move to open a 
large discount mart in the heart of 
downtown to defending school bud-
gets, the Association has flexed its 
political muscle on more than one 
occasion. 


During Daniels' 1991 bid for the 
mayor's seat, the Association set a 
number of conditions before endors-
ing him for reelection. The ministers 
called on Daniels to consider 
Edmonds for another seat on the 
school board, follow the scattered-site 
low-income housing plan (see story 
page 29), avert city layoffs, and meet 
Connecticut's minimum spending 
requirement for public schools. After 
Daniel's victory, some in the 
Association became enraged when he 
failed to live up to many of his 
promises. Their concern with Daniels 
approaches the paternal. "Too often 
we have bitten our tongue and turned 
the other way like parents who cannot 
believe what an offspring is doing, and 
doing right before their very eyes," 
Rev. Bosie Kimber of First Cavalry 
Baptist told the New Haven Register. 
"We cannot in good conscience 
remain silent any longer." 


Kimber, 
chairman 
of 
the 
Associ~tion's political action arm, the 
Outreach Committee, believes that 
black churches ought to have a special 
place in the city's political community. 
"We ought to have special privileges to 
speak to the mayor whenever we desire 
to speak to him, for the simple reason 
that we have hundreds of people 
whom we can turn to any individual 
who runs for any elected office," he 
said. "We not only speak for ourselves 
but for our congregations." 


Daniels acknowledges that clergy 
will occupy a pivotal position in the 
next mayoral election. He argues, 
however, that support for his adminis-
tration among black clergy and their 
congregations remains strong, despite 
the views of Kimber arid Edmonds. 
"Two or three ministers do not make 
the Association," Daniels said. 
"Edmonds and Kimber have their 
own special agendas. But the rest of 
the clergymen are very supportive of 
me. " 


Although some preachers prefer 
to change city government from the 
outside, many black ministers do not 
hesitate to take positions of responsi-
bility within city government as well. 
Since 1982, black ministers have sat 
on both the school and public housing 
boards of New Haven. These boards 
play key roles in d ealing with two 
issues close to the heart of the pastors: 
affordable and adequate housing for 
the disadvantaged of their congrega-
tions, and, most especially, the future 
of black youth. 


The ImmanueL Baptist Church 
Young Adult Choir presents a gospel song 
with a pop, up-to-date beat. Boys and 
girls, dressed in suits and Sunday dresses, 
follow obediently as their parents sing 
with the congregation and pray with the 
preacher. One little girl in pigtails sings 
"Down on My Knees" enthusiastically 
along with the choir. She is the foture of 
the black church. 


At First Pentecostal, C.]., Deacon 
Ashe's teenage son and Reverend Ashe's 
grandson, plays the drums to accompany 
every song. In the tiny space of the store-
front, the sound of his drums and the 
shouted verses are almost tleaftning. The 
children squirm impatiently as their par-
erzts stand, shout, and sing, caught up in 
the collective electricity of the service. 
One little boy with a buzz-cut draws 
crayon pictures, ignoring the commotion 
around him. He, too, is the foture of 


While the city of Greenwich 
spends an annual average of $9,200 
for every child in its schools, New 
Haven spends about $6,800 per child. 
"The kid in Greenwich is being pro-
grammed to go to Yale," said Kimber, 
"while the kid in New Haven is being 
programmed to go to jail." 


Black churches try to offer educa-
tional and developmental support that 
the city cannot provide to New Haven 
youth. Kimber's church conducts a 
summer enrichment program for city 
youth, while Immanuel Baptist and 
Dixwell U.C.C. have tried establishing 
day care facilities or after-school activi-
ties. Rev. Justice works directly with 
the children and young adults of his 
congregation. A week after Malcolm X 
opened, he brought a group of 
teenagers to see the movie and led a 
discussion with them afterwards. In 
his church, he stresses Afrocentrism by 
putting up posters with the words 
"Kwanzaa Greetings" on the doors of 
the church and encouraging African-
inspired dress and clothing among the 
young adults of Bethel. 


Justice's efforts to bring young 
people back into the church reflect the 
black church's concern for its own sur-
vival. The black preachers of New 
Haven have begun to reach out to the 
"unchurched" generation, hoping to 
secure the continued existence of a 
congregation, inculcate values and 
discipline, and protect teens from the 
dangers of the city. Justice hopes that 
by advocating Afrocentrism, he can 
enhance black children's self-esteem. 
He runs a three-month education 
program for young adults and fo r 
anyone else who wants to join the 
church. "It is not my intention to get 
all the folk in Bethel," says Justice, "as 
long as they go to a church." 


The breakdown of traditional 
family structures and the high mobili-
ty rate of many black families has led 
to a decline in the number of consis-
tent churchgoers. As more and more 
middle-class blacks move to the sub-
urb~, and as government funds for 
programs for the poor dwindle, the 
black churches in the city scramble to 
finance alternative programs. "You 
live with the pain of poverty," says 
Edmonds. As the case of Dixwell 
U.C.C. shows, trying to be all things 
to all people can sap the energy of 
ministers. "But that doesn't stop our 
need to try," says Edmonds, "because 
that's the tradition of the black 
church." Dixwell U.C.C. could have 
moved to the suburbs, but he and 
previous pastors decided to remain in 
the inner city, to do what they can for 
the urban poor. 


Small storefront churches also 
minister, in their own way, to the 
needy. Before the Sunday service, 
Elder Ashe stops passersby in the 
depressed neighborhood outside, 
inviting them in to worship with the 
Lord. H e believes saving their· souls 
will also save them from the streets. 
Rev. Cofield envisions a church open 
24 hours a day, where services go on 
without a break, because people need 
"salvation around the clock." In this 
time of need, Cofield believes even 
more in the necessity of bringing the 
church to the people, not the people 
to the church.
