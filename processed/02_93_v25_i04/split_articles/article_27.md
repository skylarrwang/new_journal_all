ew Haven's latest attempt to geographically deseg-
regate public housing ended last fall in a heap of 
ashes. On Sept. 18 and Oct. 26, arsonists destroyed 
two houses the Housing Authority of New Haven (HANH) 
had purchased in Morris Cove-an almost entirely white, 
well-to-do community in the New Haven's East Shore 
area-as part of scattered-site housing, a plan that aims to 
get public housing out of the inner-city and distribute it 
throughout the rest ofNew Haven. 

Many scattered-site housing supporters have attributed 
the arsons to racism, which they believe has fueled opposi-
tion to the plan from the start. They charge that the resi-
dents of Morris Cove-who have fought bitterly against 
scattered-site housing since HANH purchased a number of 
homes there in October 1991-have opposed the plan 
because it would bring people of color to their neighbor-
hood. Mayor John Daniels called the torchings "racially 
motivated acts of terror." Public-housing tenants agreed. 
"People are doing in blue jeans what they used to do in 
white hoods. That's the only difference," said tenant 
Minnie Anderson. 

Morris Cove residents contest the accusations, insisting 
that they have rejected public-housing relocation for eco-
nomic reasons. They claim that the fact that 
minorities make up about 90 percent of 
New Haven's public-housing population 
has nothing to do with their opposition. 
"Take the word 'racist' out of the debate," 
said Alderman Chris DePino (R-14), who 
points out that some middle-class blacks 
have joined him in attacking the project. 
"Our argument is against the plan, not 
against the people." 

At a rally for peace held in Morris Cove 
shortly after the last arson occurred, howev-
er, the rhetoric seemed racially heated and 
personally accusatory. As civil-rights 
activists, local politicians, and public-hous-
ing tenants condemned the arsons, Morris 
Cove homeowners, who had not been allot-
ted speaking time, lashed out at them. "I 
pay for you!" one woman yelled at a tenant, 
and mutterings of "welfare princess" floated 
through the gathering. 

"I heard a lot of 'they people,' 'them 
people,' and 'you people,' " recalled 
ff.BRUARY S• 1993 
Anderson. " 'They're dirty. They're all on welfare. Their kids 
don't go to school.'" Local NAACP President Haywood 
Hooks, Jr., who organized the event, blamed the remarks on 
racially-based prejudices. "Whenever people show the color 
of their skin and they're turned down before they have a 
chance to present themselves, as far as I'm concerned the 
judgments are based on racism," he said. 

Alderman DePino, a prominent New Haven 
Republican who represents Morris Cove in the state legisla-
ture, defends his constituents. He asserts that the bitter 
comments made at the rally come from radicals on the 
fringe. For most Morris Cove residents, he says, race plays 
no part in the scattered-site issue, which he says is a purely 
economic one. 

But historically speaking, racial intolerance has played 
an ugly role in Morris Cove. A community of about 1,400 
families, only one of which is black, this Italian-American 
stronghold resists any threat to its homogeneity. As recently 
as the early 1980s, residents compelled a black family to 
leave by bombarding them with racial insults and vandaliz-
ing their home. At about the same time, a black member of 
a Morris Cove-based band faced a dangerous situation every 
time he came to the area to practice. The other band mem-
bers had to call their neighbors before-
hand to tell them not to destroy the 
man's car. DePino insists that this big-
otry has ended. "It was a dark chapter 
in the community's history," he said, 
"and it's behind us." 

S 
ince the 1970s, the Department 
of 
Housing 
and 
Urban 
Development 
(HUD) 
has 
required that all new public-housing 
units be placed in non-impacted 
areas-that is, in areas that do not g 
already have high concentrations of! 
public housing. The decision sought to ~ 
provide public-housing tenants with~ 
adequate services-from law enforce- i;; 
ment to education to transportation-l 
that they may not receive in the ghet- ~ 
ros.

E 
New Haven's woes began with the 
11988 destruction of the Elm Haven 
..( high rises, a 366-unit public-housing 
development that HANH deemed 
substandard. A 1988 law required a 
one-for-one replacement of the elimi-
nated units. Section Eight, a private 
landlord-driven program, took care of 
half of the tenants, and the housing 
authority began the search for the 
remaining 183 units it needed, which 
had to be in non-impacted areas. 

But the housing authority did not 
purchase a single unit for the next 
three years. In 1991, New Haven 
Legal Assistance sued the authority on 
behalf of a handful of disgruntled ten-
ants and Christian Community 
Action-a grass-roots, tenant-interest 
organization-alleging that through 
continued foot-dragging the authority 
had failed to meet tenant needs. 

Officials at HANH attributed their 
sluggish progress to difficulty in find-
ing units that satisfied health codes 
and other requirements. But Legal 
Assistance attorney Shelly White 
believes the authority's reluctance to 
trigger vehement opposition by plac-
ing public housing in affluent, white 
communities led to the three-year 
delay. 

With Legal Assistance's litigation 
pending, the authority began to pur-
chase private single-family houses in 
non-impacted areas like Morris Cove 
and Wesrville. At the same time, it ini-
tiated a rigorous screening and educa-
tion process to find suitable families 
for the dwellings. Almost immediately 
public hearings on the acquisitions 
became battlefields, with screaming 
matches and threats of physical vio-
lence between groups of Morris Cove 
homeowners and public-housing ten-
ants. Sensing a political nightmare, 
most aldermen avoided the increasing-
ly touchy issue, as did Connecticut's 
senators and representatives. Mayor 
Daniels tried unsuccessfully to straddle 
the fence on the matter, alienating 
both sides by agreeing with the con-
cept of scattered-site housing but not 
supponing the plan's current form. 

Like the mayor, New Haven's 
housing authority has become a target 
i~ the struggle. Discontented tenants 
c'People are doing in 
blue jeans what they 
used to do in white 
hoods." 
and New Haven homeowners alike 
consider the authority a corrupt, irre-
sponsible agency. "The housing 
authority is very inept, totally inept, 
not even marginally inept," said 
DePino, likening money in its posses-
sion to car keys in the hands of a 
drunk. Indeed, the authority's short-
comings have not remained a secret. A 
recent HUD audit found $800,000 in 
misused funds, and the federal bureau 
has placed New Haven in the number 
two spot on its nationallist•of troubled 
housing authorities. 

H
omeowners in Morris Cove 
argue that such a wasteful and 
incompetent housing author-
ity cannot possibly run a scattered-site 
plan successfully. Single-family homes 
require more upkeep than convention-
al public-housing complexes, they say, 
and the authority does not even do a 
satisfactory job with its current units. 
They fear a drop in surrounding prop-
erty values may come about because of 
negligent maintenance of the scat-
tered-site units. Opponents also cite 
the fact that every home the housing 
authority buys for public use comes off 
the city's tax roll, thereby increasing the 
fiscal burden on remaining homeown-
ers, though no one in Morris Cove ever 
expressed this concern before HANH 
planned to place public housing in 
their neighborhood. With a recent 50 
percent property tax hike eating into 
their pocketbooks, many homeowners 
already question their ability to remain 
in New Haven if the stifling rates con-
tinue to rise. "It's purely an economic 
issue," said Bill Grego, a Morris Cove 
resident for 17 years. 

DePino says his objections to scat-
tered-site liousing represent the best 
interests of public-housing residents. 
He prefers a home-ownership plan, 
which he believes would provide a bet-
ter deal for them. "These are false 
opportunities. The real opportunity is 
to get out of public housing, and that's 
owning your own home," he said. 

DePino also points out that a home-
ownership program would keep houses , 
on the tax roll. 

But these "economic" concerns 
cannot camouflage the underlying feel-
ings of many Morris Cove residents. 
They consider the plan-· -which places 
. public-housing tenants in decent, siz-
able dwellings-unfair. "My wife and I 
have almost five jobs between the two 
of us. This is how we manage to live in 
a single-family home, and it's becom-
ing harder and harder to do it," said 
homeowner Grego. "It's difficult to 
imagine that I'm striving to do this 
while the city of New Haven wants to 
buy single-family homes and complete-
ly hand over possession of them to 
non-working people. I feel that anyone 
who wants to enjoy the lifestyle I do 
should go about it the same way." 

Grego also notes that to him and 
most of his neighbors, public-housing 
residents mean an influx of inner-city 
problems such as drugs and crime. "We 
want to get away &om downtown," he 
said. "People imagine that what exists 
in the city will somehow exist in 
Morris Cove."
