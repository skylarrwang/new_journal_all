The first things one notices are the hats. A velvet beret, with a gold cockade, bobs in the pew ahead, while a vermillion, wide-brimmed affair trailing black netting sways near a smart, white cap with a discreet tuft a few aisles over. Between the hats and the women beneath them stand broad patches of every shade of gray, black, and brown cloth, on the shoulders of men of every height, shape, and size. A thick, dark-suited gentleman with silver hair takes his seat under the soaring ceiling and stained-glass windows. A teenager in a shiny gray coat squeezes in next to an older woman, as she sings robustly along with a lively gospel song while the service begins. Despite the varied shades of their Sunday best, the people here at Immanuel Baptist Church in New Haven gather to celebrate a shared heritage, for they are African-Americans, and this is a black church. 

The black church continues to fulfill its myriad missions: to direct the community and to inspire the individual, to activate the many and to motivate the one. 

The black church, apart from the family, is the single most important institution of the African-American community. In the days of slavery, when slaveowners separated husbands from wives and mothers from children, the black church became the foundation of cohesion for Africans trapped in an alien land. In the struggle for emancipation, the black church served as a source of spiritual sustenance and moral courage. And when large numbers of blacks moved from the South to the North, the black church became a safe haven from the trials of the city. 

Amidst the increasing difficulties of life in New Haven, the black church continues to fulfill its myriad missions: to direct the community and to inspire the individual; to activate the many and to motivate the one. From the old, established congregations that worship in spacious churches to the new, snuggling groups that pray in rickety storefronts, the black churches of New Haven have become one of the most powerful political and social institutions of this city-with the mandate to speak for the black community and the means to effect change in both city government and citizens' lives. 

The room is small and the congregation close at the First Pentecostal Church of Christ, Inc. Illuminated only by the glow from a single fluorescent light, the six members of this storefront church kneel against the pews, voices blending with each other in chanted praise. Oh Lord I just want to thank you! one says. Oh God! My soul loves you! says another. 

Halelujah, 
Halelujah ... Haalelujah, 
Halelujah ... HAAAlelujah. First Pentecostal-a church no larger than a living room-resonates with the rhythm of the tiny congregation's testimonials. The people here, too, are African-Americans. And this, too, is a black church. 

Every African-American church in this city is or once was a storefront. Even the largest and one of the oldest black congregations, Immanuel Baptist Church, began in an anonymous house probably as faded and rundown as the storefront church First Pentecostal occupies today. 

As a community of free blacks grew in New Haven in the 1800s, the congregation worshipped in various buildings, the church always teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. Immanuel Baptist kept just ahead of the mortgage payments, as it moved from Carlyle Street to Webster Street, and finally from Webster to the corner of Day Street and Chapel Street in 1882.
