the traditional plodine by marrying a white woman. 

Like their female counterparts, Asian-American 
men get pegged as passive and submissive. "If you go 
to this gay bar in San Francisco, it's basically just white 
men picking up on Asian men," said Lee. "Certainly the 
stereotype out there is that Asian men are more passive." 

Some blame the media representation of Asian-American 
men for creating sexual stereotypes. "A lot of white gay men 
are looking for passive, submissive men and they think that 
Asian men will be that. The media representation makes 
them appear passive," said a white student who is dating an 
Asian-American man. 

Pressures from peer groups can force Asian-Americans 
who date interracially to choose between their ethnicity 
and their relationships. As a result, resentment of 
stereotypes adds to a fear of betraying their race. Some Asian-
American women believe that men who react negatively co 
interracial relationships do so because' they feel threatened. 
"The first time I went to a KASY [Korean-American 
Students at Yale] meeting, I overheard a man saying that he 
adamantly believed that Asian women should not be 
dating non-Asian men because it made Asian men feel 
inferior," said Jeannie Rhee (TC '94). 

Another Asian-American student active in the Asian-
American community at Yale has found it particularly diffi-
cult to balance her personal life and her politics. "When I 
first started dating someone white, I had a lot of personal 
problems," she said. "I thought that in order to be political-
ly active and aware, my personal life had to fit in with my 
politics. I ended up realizing that I have a right co be happy 
and that I don't have to live my life according to a straight 
identity politics line." 

Rhee, who is also dating a white man, does not feel that 
she must make a choice between her allegiance to her race 
and her interracial social life. "I don't feel like my relation-
ship in any way hinders my expression of my own identity 
and eth.nicity," said Rhee. She does not have close ties to the 
Asian-American community at Yale, in part because of 
remarks like the one she heard at the KASY meeting. "Those 
attitudes make me hesitant about the way I would fit in, 
regardless of my relationship," she said. 

Some Asian-American students who date interracially 
have discovered that prejudice can be implicit as well as overt. 
To them, the attitude that race plays no role in interracial 
relationships seems like passive racism. "In a lot of ways I'm 
fEBRUARY 5, 1993 
afraid that people are so accepting of my 
relationship because they don't perceive 
me to be 'Asian,'" Rhee said. "The accept-
ability and respectability comes from the fact 
that I don't have very close ties to the Asian com-
munity here." 

Rhee believes that the interracial nature of relationships 
cannot be ignored. "I think you can go too far in the other 
direction, where people can be blind to the fact that I'm 
Asian, or that they are dealing with an interracial couple," she 
said. "In a lot of ways it defines who we are as a couple, and it 
defines who I am as a person." 

Some students claim that race does not factor into their 
dealings with each other or with their peer groups. Rachael 
Nevins (BK '95), a white woman who is dating an Asian-
American man, said, "The difference in race has never been a 
problem in any real way. It's not something that 
I really think about."

But for others, their 
t c a 
nature 
against their 
will. "I'm not 
going out with 
him as a political 
statement," 
Rhee 
said. "It's unfortunate 
that it has to be perceived 
that way."
