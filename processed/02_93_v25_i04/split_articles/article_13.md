Released four years ago this May, 
the "Report of the Committee on 
Recruitment and Retention of 
Minority Group Members on the 
Faculty at Yale," better known as the 
Rodin Report, ended "on a note of 
urgency and with a call for greater 
equity and diversity at Yale." The 
report established ten-year targets for 
minority representation on the facul-
ty-targets administrators now doubt 
Yale can meet. In nearly every school 
and department, percentages of 
minority faculty, especially blacks and 
Hispanics, continue to hover at the 
pitifully low levels the Rodin Report 
deplored. 

"The numbers are not good at 
Yale, and they are not good national-
ly,, said Frances Holloway, director of 
the Office for Equal Opportunity 
Programs. She and Deputy Provost 
Charles Long oversee University-wide 
affirmative action. Both claim that 
national trends have thwarted Yale's 
good intentions. Long painted a grim 
picture of fierce competition among 
institutions of Yale's caliber for a tiny .. 
pool of qualified minority candidates, 
with universities routinely "raiding" 
each other to boost their percentages, 
only to be raided in turn the following 
year. "It's not a solution on a national 
level,, he said. "We have some exciting 
candidates in searches now ongoing, 
but we're still talking about people you 
can count on one hand., 

Holloway monitors the English 
department's yearly search to fill three 
or four open-field junior positions, 
which usually draws three to four hun-
dred applicants. "I know the depart-
ment knows what to do, but they have 
not been successful in finding black or 
Hispanic finalist candidates," she said. 
"Those candidates just aren't there. 
There is nobody, and I think that's 
outrageous." 

Nationally, whites made up about 
90 percent of all faculty in 1985-86, 
FEBRU.U.Y 5· 1993 
according to the Rodin Report. Only 
8.1 percent of Ph.D.s in the humani-
ties awarded in 1991 went to people of 
color, who account for about 20 per-
cent of the U.S. population. In other 
words, a college or university that 
wants to hire a black faculty member 
in the humanities competes with 
3~000 other institutions for about 100 
judith Rodin chair~d th~ committu on 
minority faculty. 
new Ph.D.s each year. "The numbers 
are scary," said Long. 

Among its 22 recommendations, 
the Rodin Report urged more recruit-
ment of students of color to academic 
fields at every level in the "pipeline," the 
path to an advanced degree that starts 
in high school. Yale College minority 
enrollment has continued to rise, reach-
ing 29 percent this year, and representa-
tion at the School of Medicine has 
climbed to 40 percent. The Medical 
School leads the pack in faculty hiring 
as well. "If I had to pick a spot where I 
see progress, at a very junior level, it 
would be the Med School," said 
Holloway. But in the Graduate School, 
the percentage of all students of color 
has reached just 12 percent. 

The Rodin Report attempted to 
address both the broader causes of the 
low numbers and to suggest changes in 
university policy that would bolster 
affirmative action in hiring and reten-
tion. It urged a more extensive system 
of mentors for graduate students and 
junior faculty, compensation for the 
"special burdens" on minority faculty 
members spread too thin among myri-
ad committees, and efforts to locate 
and attract candidates of color that 
include hiring them outside of formal 
searches. 

Mixed results imply that such tac-
tics can only go so far, and the univer-
siry already seems to have abandoned 
some of them. The report suggested 
the teaching load might be reduced 
for faculty of color, but according to 
Long, Yale's teaching load is already 
quite low. 

Candidates and junior faculty 
continue to be lured away by institu-
tions such as state universities on the 
tenure-track system, which guarantee 
tenure when they first hire--a guaran-
tee Yale refuses to match. "Yale only 
gives tenure to the very best," said 
Long. "We have already gone as far as 
possible in lowering budgetary barriers 
so as to provide opportunities for 
minorities and women." Strategies for 
lowering these barriers include "mort-
gaging" positions by hiring new facul-
ty members in anticipation of retire-
ments, which has proven successful. 
"But otherwise, the only possibiliry is 
to make us a tenure-track university, 
and we can't afford to do that,, said 
Long. "No one would seriously argue 
that Yale should lower its standards." 

The administration's main state-
ment on p rogress since the Rodin 
Report, this December's updated 
"Affirmative Action and Equal 
Opportunity Policies," mostly con-
tains descriptions of new procedures 
and monitoring committees. Reports 
of proportionate ethnic representation 
on the faculty seem years away. 

Holloway blames lack of Ph.D. fund-
ing and role models on the arts and 
sciences faculty for the high number of 
people of color who instead turn to 
fields like medicine or law. Her office 
TH£ NEW jOURNAL 5 

continues to monitor searches as she 
urges departments to work towards 
"the real affirmative action," which she 
describes as taking place on the level of 
networking, informal conversations, 
and overall attitudes. While she said 
that departments seem genuinely sup-
portive of affirmative action in her 
dealings with them, she emphasized 
that no office can ensure the intangible 
atmosphere that will make, for 
instance, a lone black faculty member 
feel completely welcome. "All the 
monitoring is necessary as a check on 
the system," Long observed. "But until 
higher education in general seems a 
more attractive path to minorities, 
these efforts, while laudable, are 
bound to be effective only in a very 
Limited way."

**Title: Bridging the Gap**
**Page number(s): 6**

Students and administrators 
established the ethnic counselor pro-
gram to ease minority students' transi-
tion to Yale. Although hindered by 
their uncertain status within the fresh-
person counseling program, ethnic 
counselors do their best to uphold the 
principles behind their positions. 

"Because minority students have their 
own unique experiences at Yale, they 
need guidance from a person who can-
share similar kinds of experiences," 
said Don Nakanishi (SY '71), one of 
the first ethnic counselors. However, 
some students debate the need for eth-
nic counselors and see the program as 
encouraging separatism. 

The ethnic counselor program 
began in 1972 through the collective 
efforts of student groups, minority 
students, and administrators who 
acknowledged the changes that greater 
diversity and coeducation had brought 
to Yale. At the time, most minority 
students came from inner-city or pre-
dominantly ethnic neighborhoods, 
and Yale provided their first experience 
6 THE New jouRNAL 
of life in a largely white community. 

The program provided students of 
color with upperclass ethnic peers 
who could help them confront issues 
of racial, cultural, or linguistic differ-
ence. "When we admit certain stu-
dents who we feel can succeed here, we 
must provide them with adequate sup-
port," said Assistant Dean Mary Li 
Hsu (SY '80), Coordinator of Asian-
American Student Affairs. 

Despite good intentions, a lack of 
focus plagued the program in its early 
years. The first ethnic counselors, 
called "floating counselors," did not 
live on Old Campus, and few clear 
goals specified their roles. As a resulc, 
the position brought with it broad and 
open-ended re.sponsibilities. But as 
time passed, the program developed 
into a more structured and indepen-
dent institution. 

At present, 11 ethnic counselors 
join the freshperson counselors for an 
intensive three-day training program 
in August that includes lectures, dis-
cussions, and role-playing on mental 
health and student issues. During the 
school year, ethnic counselors contact 
counsdees in much the same way resi-
dential counselors do--through study 
breaks and dinner dates. 

Ethnic counselor Julia Gore (CC 
'93) believes that her role encompasses 
facets of undergraduate life not cov-
ered by the general freshperson coun-
seling program. "I am a residential 
counselor with an ethnic perspective, 
an ethnic sensitivity," she said. 

Gore does not exclusively handle 
issues of race, but some students feel 
uncertain about approaching an ethnic 
counselor with problems other than 
those related to ethnicity. "I wasn't 
sure if I had to differentiate my prob-
lems as either personal or ethnic," said 
Nicole Rodriguez (CC '94). "Was I 
supposed to go to my residential coun-
selor for certain problems, then to my 
ethnic counselor for others? I felt that 
my residential counselor should have 
been able to handle any problem that I 
confronted." 

Some students voice discomfort 
with the ethnic counselor program for 
other reasons. International students 
are assigned ethnic counselors, 
although they may feel distant from 
U.S. issues of ethnicity. And often 
studen ts who come from predomi-
nantly white neighborhoods do not 
feel they need an ethnic counselor to 
help them cope with living in a famil-
iar environment. 

T he ethnic counseling program 
has also come under attack for unfairly 
benefitting students of color in a way 
that leads to separatism. Gloria Akan 
(DC '94) said that a few white people 
she knew freshperson year expressed 
annoyance that she had an extra coun-
selor because of her ethnicity. 

"I 
wasn't sure if their discomfort was 
because they felt disadvantaged," she 
said, "or because they thought I was 
receiving preferential treatment." 

Assistant Dean Valeriano Ramos 
(ES '81), Coordinator ofPueno Rican 
Student Affairs and administrator of 
the ethnic counselor program, denies 
that the ethnic counselor program 
polarizes the campus into separate 
communities. He believes that a stu-
dent's integration into an ethnic com-
munity is part of his or her adjustment 
to Yale. "The ethnic counselor is there 
to offer all minority students the 
chance to find their own community 
at Yale, not just to become a part of 
only the ethnic community," said 
Ramos. "Integrating freshpeople into 
the larger Yale community is a task 
that's as important." 

To Ramos, charges of separatism 
are the least of the challenges that face 
the ethnic counselor program. Instead, 
he admits that certain logistical aspects 
of the program hinder a counselor's 
effectiveness. Because students of color 
are assigned to ethnic counselors on 
the basis of similar ethnic back-
grounds-rather than on an equal 
number of students per counselor-
ethnic counselors handle students from 
three to six colleges, with an average of 
16 to 50 counselees per counselor.
