Freshperson coun-
~ selor Steve Ribisi (CC 
'93) acknowledged the 
unintentional communi-
cation gaps between the 
residential and ethnic 
counselors. "I feel com-
fortable talking with the 
eth nic counselors about 
the freshpeople, but chere 
is a little division," he said. 
"Residential counselors 
live and work as a team. 
The ethnic counselors are 
not pare of the same bond 
because we don't see them 
Ethnic couns~lors try to ~as~ fteshp~ons' transition to Yak. on a daily basis." 
In comparison, residential coun· 
selors take on only eight to 22 fresh-
people each. 
Ethnic counselor 
Catherine Lee (PC '94) believes that 
the higher number of counselees lim its ~ 
opportunities fo r close ties. "It just"" 
depends on how often our paths tend 
h > cross," she said. In add ition, many 
ethnic counselors do not live in their 
counselees' residential halls, which 
leaves them unaware of some counse-
lees' problems. 
O ld Campus security regulations 
also dictate that counselors can only 
access four Old Campus enrryways. "I 
felt it was ridiculous having to choose 
which counselees' dorms I had access 
to," said M ialisa Villafane (PC '93), 
head ethnic counselor. 
Yale's loop of support for fresh-
people also sometimes leaves ethnic 
counselors on the outside. The ethnic 
counselo rs must both build lines of 
communication with the freshperson 
counselors and the dean of the college 
they serve, and stay in touch with their 
counterparts in other colleges. "It can 
gee really confusing because there are

only k now a fractio n of a college's 
freshpeople, wh ich distances them 
from aspects of the weekly counselor 
meetings. Still, they do not necessarily 
view reaching out to all freshpeople as 
part of their job. "Ethnic counselors 
will always be separate because they do 
not serve the entire community," said 
Lisa Burgos (MC '91), a former ethnic 
counselor. 
Nevertheless, Dean Ramos argues 
that the p rogram benefits all in the 
Yale community, including white stu-
dents and counselees who do nor seek 
out their ethnic counselors. He 
believes that ethnic counselors create a 
greater sense of personal awareness in 
their counselees, thus providing other 
students with a chance to learn about 
these students' cultures and communi-
ties. "Yo u have to provide channels 
through which issues of ethnicity 
come out," he said. "Without the 
input from ethnic groups, the larger 
commu nity wouldn't understand the 
issues confronting these groups."
