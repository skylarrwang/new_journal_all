Grego's concerns typify homeowners' attitudes, which infuriates public-housing tenant Anderson. 
"The community is so ignorant. I try not to get angry, but I can't help it," she said. One of the "nonworking people" who applied for a scattered-site unit, the 44-year-old Anderson has been a criminal investigator for Legal Assistance for several years. Together with her daughter, who works at the U.S. Surgical factory in North Haven, and her grandson, she lives in a townhouse in the Waverly housing development, a privilege that costs her $718 a month in rent. 

Stories like Anderson's come as a surprise to most middle-class homeowners, who assume that public housing comes free to a largely lazy, unemployed tenant population. Middle-class homeowners also believe public housing inevitably falls into disrepair. 

Anderson believes that racial stereotypes inspire misconceptions. "You can fix up every housing development in New Haven and make it look like a mansion, and as long as you have minorities you're still going to have the same perception of the people," she said. 

Alderman DePino, who regularly distributes anti-scattered-site housing pamphlets throughout Morris Cove, denies that the color of public-housing tenants matters to him or his constituents. He continually reasserts that their quarrel is with the housing authority, not the people it serves. 
"The housing authority is making it an 'us' versus 'them' issue so they can deflect the focus from taxes, their incompetence, and all the other issues," he said. However, DePino's case against the authority brings the issue of race into the fore. "I think the real way to solve the problem in the housing authority is to let more non-minority people run the place," he said. "The housing authority is run by minorities. And they haven't done a good job. They can't see the forest through the trees." 

The Morris Cove arsons, no matter how they are explained away, have sent scattered-site housing applicants a clear message: Stay out. As a result, applicants like Anderson question whether the move is worth it. "People believed that public housing was just a temporary stop until they were able to do better and move out on their own," Anderson explained. "Then they hear about torched houses and think, 'Maybe we're supposed to live here forever.' They stop looking for other places because this is the safest." 

Scattered-site opponents have also felt the heat. "The arsons were absolutely reprehensible," said DePino, and most Morris Cove residents agree. 
DePino regrets the unproven assumption that someone from Morris Cove committed the crime, as it has branded his community as racist. "It gave the proponents of the plan a great propaganda tool," he remarked. 

As local, state, and federal officials continue to investigate the fires, the housing authority promises to push on with the scattered-site plan. Program supporters accept that the violence may continue, but they refuse to let it derail their plans. "This is what tenants want," said Legal Assistance's White. "I don't think the answer is to give up and not place the houses there. We would never have had a civil rights movement had we stopped at the threat of physical violence."
