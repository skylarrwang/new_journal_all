n a walk home from the gym one evening last 
spring, Yusef Poole (BR '95) and Jason Watt (CC 
'95) noticed a white female student in front of 
them looking over her shoulder and then moving out of 
their path. "She made a great effort to get out of our way," 
said Watt. "She clung to the wall on the side of Morse and 
looked at us like we were about to attack her." 

Black students at Yale report that fellow students, facul-
ty, and police often treat them as if they pose a threat. With 
deadening regularity, students who are not black speed up 
to get away from black students on the street, ask to see 
their identification, and slam college gates in their faces. For 
<(What is a Yale student, that you 
assumed I wasn 't one? Why would 
you stop and question me as opposed to 
another student?n 
many black students, suspicion becomes the stuff of daily 
interactions, so much so that they almost cease to notice it. 
''I'm so desensitized," said Rhassan Manning (BK '94). 
"This happens a lot to me and my friends, but it's strange to 
think of it as an issue." 

Yale's urban setting brings into sharp focus the question 
of who belongs on campus. Many students and faculty 
react warily to people who look like they might not be affil-
iated with Yal~those whose color or dress stands out from 
the expected clean-cut student look. Black students often 
become the targets of such suspicion. The encounters that 
result may stem from whites' desire to protect themselves 
against the anonymous dangers of New Haven, yet they 
take place one-on-one, in the realm of the inescapably per-
sonal. As a result, they often undermine black students' 
sense of themselves as members of the Yale community. 

Black students believe that most of the suspicion they 
face comes from the connection, conscious or unconscious, 
that whites draw between blacks, New Haven residents, and 
crime. Split-second judgments based on the assumprion 
that blacks are trouble create misunderstandings and worse. 
"You think, 'I can't tell a dangerous black person from a Yale 
student black person,' so the next logical step is to treat 
them all like outsiders," said Orlando Bishop (PC '94). 

The pattern of fear and suspicion that black students 
face on the street intensifies at campus entry points. 
Tension over who has the right of access rises most at col-
lege gates and entryway doors-sensitive spots for outsider 
intrusion. According to Yale's security policy, anyone who 
tries to get into a college without a key must show his or her 
ID. But most students apply the policy selectively. While 
white students hold gates for each other without asking 
questions, black students say they receive a different kind of 
treatment. "Often it's hard for someone to open an entry-
way for me," said Crystal Marie Smith (DC '93). Like 
many students, she has most frequently met with such 
problems on Old Campus. "Last year I'd go to visit a friend 
there and ask a group of 15 people to open the door, and 
they'd all say no." 

Much of the suspicion from white students expresses 
itself in a Â·vague pattern of looks, gestures, and uncomfort-
able moments that black students can neither prove nor 
ignore. "People close gates in my face, walk faster, or eve9 
just hesitate," said Bishop. "A lot of people get startled o'r 
frightened if they come out and see me in a hallway." 

Because these encounters take place in fleeting moments of 
personal contact, they remain difficult to confront. "With a 
lot of this stuff it's subtle," Bishop said. "You can't pinpoint 
it. That's what's frustrating. Over time you see a difference 
in the way you're treated, but other people can argue that 
there isn't one if they don't want to see it." 

The subtle difference in treatment becomes even more 
difficult for black students to address when it comes from 
faculty and administrators. When Fra~gher Williams (CC 
'92) went to look for a friend one afternoon in the William 
L. Harkness (WLH) classroom building, a professor 
watched him as he walked the hallway looking in classroom 
windows. Williams went up to the second floor, and the 
professor followed. As Williams started back down the 
stairs, the professor stood at the bottom and blocked the 
way. He asked Williams to state his purpose and show his 
identification. 

Williams explained himself to the professor and left 
WLH rattled and upset. He went to talk to a friend, who 
advised him to go back. When Williams found the profes-
sor, he questioned the faculty member about the reasons 
for his suspicion. "I asked him: 'What is a Yale student, that 
you assumed I wasn't one?'" Williams said. "'Why would 
you stop and question me as opposed to another student?'"

The professor's answer only made Williams feel worse. 
"He said: 'There's been a rash of New Haven people in and 
out of the building," Williams recalled, "and I thought you 
were one of them.'" 

Such responses are common, and they pose a double-
edged problem for black students. On one hand, many 
feel bitter about whites' assumption that because they 
are black, they must not go to Yale. But at the same time, 
black students do not want to disassociate themselves from 
the New Haven black community. By protesting their 
treatment, black students risk shifting attitudes of trust and 
acceptance to include themselves, but not other blacks. 

These concerns especially apply to black students' 
attempts to improve their interactions with the police. 
Although black students know that as Yalies they 
should not have to tolerate suspicion and harass-
ment, they worry that putting the problem into stu-
dent vs. non-student terms fails to overturn under-
lying racist stereotypes. "It's messed up in the sense 
that cops still assume that if you're black, you're a 
criminal, but if you're a Yale student, -then you're 
cool," said Eddie Poteat (TO '94). 

Confrontations with police make black stu-
dents keenly aware of the shaky ground they stand 
on. Many report that police are quick to question 
their place in the Yale community. In November of 
1991, a police car approached Shawn Golden (BK 
'94) just before midnight on Beinecke Plaza. The 
police officer reported that as he 
drove up, Golden turned to 
walk away; Golden says that 
the police officer shined the 
car's headlights into his face. 
The officer got out of the car 
and asked if Golden knew 
anything about some type-
writers that had been 
stolen from Woodbridge 
Hall. Although other 
students also passed by, 
he questioned only 
Golden. 

Because 
Golden was not 
enrolled at the time 
and so did not 

have a student ID, the police officer did not believe his 
claims to be a student. EventuaUy, he let Golden go, but his 
report of the event remains in Golden's permanent Yale file. 
Golden believes that the police officer stopped him 
because he is a young black male who chooses not to dress 
like a "typical" Yale student. His assessment exposes an 
added twist in the question of who gets treated like an out-
sider on campus. Because appearance is often the basis for 
suspicion, dress, hair, and personal style play a role in which 
black students get stopped most. Students who wear "prep-
py" clothes and look traditionally "clean cut" face fewer 
questions than those who wear baggy pants, high top sneak-
ers, and baseball 
jackets. "I have less 
of a problem than 
some other people, 
because I have that 
'nice Negro image,"' 
said Anthony Miles 
(BR '93). "That's 
who I am, the way 
I'm comfortable, but 
I'm also not deviat-l 
ing from or chal-
lenging the main-~
stream cu ture.

Many 
black 
students buy Yale 
hats, book bags, or 
sweat shirts to iden-
tify 
themselves; 
others choose to 
dress

conservatively. This strategy helps, but 
it is far from foolproof. "The way I 
look," said Miles, "doesn't mean I 
don't get stopped by the police." 

Some black students deal with 
harassment by changing their 
behavior rather than their 
appearance. Some don't drop in on 
friends without calling first to avoid 
asking white students to open gates or 
entryways for them. Some choose to 
distance themselves from the rest of 
the student body as a result of the atti-
tudes they perceive around them. "I 
have my friends, and that's who I hang 
out with," said Kassem Lucas (TC 
'94). "I've accepted the situation and 
dealt with it." 

For some students, encounters 
with suspicion fuel the urge to move 
off campus. In their own apartments, 
black students can close the door, at 
least part of the time, on the problems 
they face at Yale. Some black students 
have moved to a cluster of streets 
behind Pierson College where they can 
make a space for themselves in a pre-
dominantly black neighborhood. ''I'd 
rather be in a neighborhood where I 
feel like I belong, and here on 
Edgewood I know that no one's going 
to stop me," said Valdir Barbosa (TD 
'94). "For me, moving off was a matter 
of leaving Yale so that I could feel 
comfortable in my own home." 

The number of black students 
who move off campus matches the 12 
percent of the general Yale undergrad-
uate population. But the reasons that 
black students give for moving off dif-
fer from those of white students. Black 
students often speak of deep-rooted 
feelings of alienation and cultural dif-
ference. As a result, they often do not 
maintain close ties with campus life. 
''A lot of black students who move off 
never hang out in their colleges," said 
Smith. "They go to register, drop off 
their schedule, and that's it." 

For other black students, the deci-
sion to remain on campus reflects a 
commitment to dealing with the prob-
lems they have encountered at Yale. 
Although the professor who stopped 
Williams in WLH later published an 
apology in the Yale Daily News, for 
Williams the episode had a lasting 
impact. "That professor put me at a 
loss," he said. "It was the low point 
when I really lost confidence in Yale. I 
was hurt and shocked at the time, and 
it still bothers me." Yet in spite of that 
incident and others, Williams put 
aside the impulse to leave campus and 
lived in his college throughout his four 
years as an undergraduate. "I made a 
conscious decision to keep a presence 
in my college," said Williams. "I want-
ed to stay in Calhoun because there are 
so few black students there." 

Whatever personal decisions they 
make in terms of how and where they 
live at Yale, experiences of harassment 
lead black students to call on Yale's 
white students, administration, and 
police to examine their own behavior. 
Only if the white community devotes 
energy to finding solutions, they say, 
will the problem begin to fade. 

To date, the police department 
has been the part of the Yale commu-
nity most involved in dealing with 
black students' complaints. In the past 
two years that effort has begun to pay 
off, and the relationship between 
police and 
black students has 
improved. 

Both police and students give 
much of the credit to community-
based policing, the patrol system Yale 
Police shifted to in 1990. Between 6 
p.m. and 2 a.m., Yale officers monitor
