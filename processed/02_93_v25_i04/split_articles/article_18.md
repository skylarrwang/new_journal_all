t's Friday afternoon outside Yale Station. As a student 
opens the door to the post office, she hears a persistent 
voice in her ear: "Are you Jewish? Are you Jewish?" A 
black hat, a beard, and a hand full of pamphlets stretch 
towards her. 

For Jewish Yale students, the question posed by the 
Lubavitcher Orthodox H asidic Jews who 
run the Mitzvah Tank underscores the 
dilemma of choosing how and whether 
they define themselves as Jews. Most stu-
dents spend time trying to integrate iden-
tity into community. Before Jewish stu-
dents can determine this, they must fig-
ure out what, after all, is a Jew. Certainly 
th:e term "Jewish" describes a member of 
a specific group. But is Jewish a religious, 
cultural, racial, or ethnic designation, or 
some combination thereof? Ever since 
Moses Simons (BA 1809) the first Jew to 
attend Yale, arrived on campus, the lives 
of Jewish students have reflected a variety 
of approaches to the question of Jewish 
identity. 

Historically, Jews have not always 
had the luxury of finding their own defi-
nition of Judaism. Instead, mainstream 
society, through both overt and implicit 
prejudice, imposed one on them. For 
many, the Holocaust stands as a devastat-
ing testament to social labelling of Jews. "If it had not been 
for the Nazis," said history professor Peter Gay, "if someone 
asked me if I was a Jew, I would have said no." Jean-Paul 
Sartre took this perspective to an extreme in his book Anti-
Semite and the jew. "If the Jew did not exist," he wrote, "the 
anti-Semite would invent 
him." 

As Yale, like American 
society, has become more 
accepting of different cultures, 
the luxury of tolerance has ere-
aced the difficult task of self-
definition. For many, Jewish 
identity involves more than a 
birthright. Rather, it rests on a conscious decision. "I defi-
nitely chink you can stop being Jewish by deciding it's not 
important to you any more," said Angela Warnick OE '94). 

"More important than having some Jewish blood is that 
you do things that show that you are Jewish." Some take 
Warnick's position a step further. Mitch Zacks (SM '95), 
Hillel Executive Committee Co-Coordinator, believes that 
to be Jewish, students must in some way affiliate themselves 
with the Jewish community. "I think if you are a Jew at 
Yale, you must at the very least come co 
the Kosher Kitchen once in your four 
years, '.' he said. "Or if not that, find 
some way to contribute to Jewish life on 
campus." 

Many ritually observant Jews like 
Zacks believe that the repetition of 
Jewish ceremony and worship sustains 
the identity of the group. Orthodox 
sects believe that only those who obey 
strict laws set out in the H ebrew Bible 
and Talmud count as true Jews. 

"Hasidim insist that either a Jew serves 
God and is mamish a Jew-really a 
Jew-or is a Jew awaiting full expression 
of his or her Judaism," said Rabbi James 
Ponet (TO '68). 

But Jews who do not follow tradi-
tional observances agree neither with 
this Orthodox argument nor with 
Zacks' minimalist standard. "As a reli-
gion, Judaism does not have a strong 
part in my life," said Beth Gardiner (PC 
'93). "But instinctively, I guess l would define myself as 
Jewish." Secular Jews tend to see Judaism as based on com-
mon culture, although they may not feel comfortable speci-
fying its parameters. 

To others, the concept of a cultural definicion of Judaism 
seems nonsensical. "I don't 
think I'm touched by 
Jewish culture at all," said 
Gay, who rarely goes to 
synagogue and who holds 
classes 
on 
the High 
H olidays, the holiest days 
of the Jewish year. 

For man~ common historical memory 
stands as the only strand of jewish 
identity that all jews canÂ· share. 

If a broad notion of shared culture cannot bond all the 
divergent Jewish viewpoints and practices to{;ether, can
