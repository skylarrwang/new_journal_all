EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Issues of race and ethnicity continue to split this nation 
apart. The riot that rocked Los Angeles in April 1992 
sent us a message of rage and despair, and the SOOth 
anniversary of Columbus forced us to re-examine the 
impact of his discovery upon America's indigenous peo-
ples. Race should have been on everyone's mind, especially 
during the 1992 presidential election. 

But it wasn't. The promising racial dialogue that 
emerged from the riots faded as tiine passed. Yet the issues 
surrounding race and ethnicity continued to play a crucial 
role in the social scene of this country. At Yale and in New 
Haven, these issues have particularly strong resonance-
yet often we do not discuss them. Much of the time, we 
consider racial issues too touchy or troubling to confront, 
or we are simply too exhausted to bridge the gaps in racial 
and cultural understanding that f~ce Â· our community. We 
feel that everything has been said, and that no one has lis-
tened. 

This month's TN] tries to say something new in the 
racial and cultural debate. We've titled this issue "Rights of 
Passage" because many of the people featured in our arti-
cles are fighting for equal access to Yale and to the city. 
But "Rights of Passage" has a double meaning. If the Yale 
community moves toward ensuring equality for all its 
members, the university itself will undergo a rite of pas-
sage, and approach a new level of maturity. 

In this issue, we have not tried for comprehensive cov-
erage of all the racial and ethnic issues that affect Yale and 
New Haven. But we have made a beginning-one which 
we intend to build upon in the future as we continue to 
cover racial and ethnic issues. We hope to provoke our 
readers to think about the changes that our university and 
our city so badly need.
