Being in a black sorority is like being in a family. 
You are not constantly reminded that you are a 
woman or that you are black," said Julia Gore 
(CC '93), president of the black sorority Alpha Kappa 
Alpha. The structure of a black sorority gave Gore what her 
life at Yale lacked. Yet the concept of ethnic fraternities and 
sororities remains unfamiliar and at times controversial to 
the majority of white students. At best, most have a hazy 
sense of these low-profile organizations, which include a 
Jewish fraternity, a Latino fraternity and sorority, three 
black fraternities, and two black sororities. Members of 
these organizations defend ethnic fraternities and sororities 
as support mechanisms in an environment often hostile to 
their needs. However, other students claim that ethnic 
greek organizations encourage a separatist mentality among 
both members and non-members. 

In contrast to their non-ethnic counterparts, ethnic fra-
ternities and sororities emphasize community service over 
social drinking. "You're not supposed to get drunk with 
your pin on," said one sorority sister. A separate national 
governing body administers the black organizations. 
Frequently members belong to New Haven chapters com-
posed of a variety of surrounding schools. The role ethnic 
greek organizations play in their ethnic community on the 
Yale campus and in the larger Yale student population, how-
ever, most distinguishes them from other fraternities and 
sororities. 

To m~ny members, joining an ethnic fraternity or 
sorority provides a niche in a university environment they 
find indifferent. Diahann Billings (ES '94) of Alpha Kappa 
Alpha claims that as a black woman, white students often 
pigeonhole her views. "For instance, it's commonly thought 
that black women are pro-choice,,. she said. "But your 
sorority sisters would not assume that about you." 

M'Balia Singley (SY '94) believes that Yale offers few 
opportunities for women to bond intensely. Women of 
color, according to Singley, especially need this outlet. 
"People of color here are very thirsty," she said. "They need 
places where they can vent their creative talents-where 
people respect them totally on the basis of their intellect." 

While Singley chose not to belong to a black sorority 
because she found her own support system within the cam-
pus artS community, she sympathizes with women who feel 
a need to join. 

Lambda Upsilon Lambda, a Latino fraternity estab-
lished last year, tries to foster support and ethnic identity in 
20 THE NEW JouRNAL 
much the same way as black sororities. During the rush 
process, pledges incorporate Spanish and pre-Columbian 
symbolism into their activities, frequently in the form of 
chants and songs. 

The Lambdas also envision their fraternity as a way to 
unite the entire Latino community and create a dialogue 
with the larger Yale student population. LUL, in addition 
to being the abbreviation of the fraternity, also stands for 
c'La Unidad Latino," the Latino Unity. Geoff Heredia (CC 
'93), one of the founding members, finds this goal elusive in 
a Latino com-
munity that fre-
quently divides 
along national, 
language, 
and 
class lines. Both 
Chicanos 
Puerto Ricans, 
for 
example, 
have 
separate 
student groups. 

Heredia believes 
LUL can share 
goals with the 
two 
organiza-
tions, especially 
in .regards to eth-
nic diversity in 
the curriculum, 
faculty, and stu-
dent body, and 
also represent the 
entire 
Latino 
community. 
"We want to 
work with every-
one," he said. 
"We don't want to isolate ourselves from Yale. We want to 
be an integral part of this university." 

Like traditional greek organizations, ethnic fraternities 
and sororities place a great emphasis on close ties among the 
members. "I know I can always count on my brothers," 
said Kassem Lucas (TC '94), a member of the black frater-
nity Kappa Alpha Psi. "My bond with my brothers is much 
stronger than any other relationship I have at Yale." Other 
black fraternity members, like Keith Price (PC '94) of

Members claim rhat the hazing in black fraternities, 
also called "going on line," forges a sense of brotherhood. 
Banned in 1990 by the national black greek council, going 
on line often involved whippings, beatings, and social pro-
bation in which members did nor speak to anyone except 
their fellow pledges and rhe brothers of the fraternities. 

While all black fraternities officially accept the ban, the 
practice continues in certain fraternities at Yale, albeit more 
secretly. One 
brother 
said 
chat 
he 
opposed 
the 
ban because it 
prevented the 
new members 
of the fraterni-
ty from devel-
. 
opmg a umque 
shared experi-
ence that has 
· historical 
meaning. 
"The ten origi-
naL 
brothers 
who founded 
my fraternity 
in the early 
1900's were the 
only blacks on 
campus," he 
said. "No one 
would talk to 
them anyway." 

T h e 
Latino fraterni-
ty, LUL, also has a stringent rush process. LUL puts pledges 
on social probation that forbids non-essential conversations 
in public, although no hazing or branding occurs. "We 
don't demean our pledges," said Heredia. "We're not here 
to break them down.'' 

While the intake process may be a positive experience 
for fraternity members, some non-members believe the 
practice leads to separatism. Adam Marks (BK '95), a mem-
ber of the non-ethnic fraternity Beta Theta Pi. recognizes

the importance of ethnic greek life for its members, yet sees g 
LUL's social probation process as a needless attempt to i' 
alienate him from friends who wanted to pledge the frater- ~ 
nity. "They are hazing the Yale community at large--defy-¢: 
ing any attempt at unity on the Yale campus," he said.

eas believes that white students, not students of~ 
color, segregate themselves. He explains that whites i-
arely come to any of the parties or lectures sponsored~ 
by the fraternity. "I don't think there is a relationship ~ 
between black fraternities and sororities and the larger Yale"'<: 
community,, said Lucas. "I don't think people take the time 
to figure out what we do." He considers the exclusion issue 
a matter of personal preference. "There's no exclusion," 
Lucas said. "I encourage anyone who wants to join the orga-
nization and who is dedicated to the fraternity to rush. It 
doesn't matter what color you are." However, no white has 
rushed the Yale chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi since its incep-
tion in 1985. 

Some students of color see ethnic fraternities as unnec-
essarily exclusionary and secretive, evenin the black com-
munity. One student recalled attending an Alpha Phi 
Alpha party Jast year with a lot of black fresh people. "There 
was this big group of Alphas hanging out and dancing by 
themselves," he said. "Then there was everybody else just 
waiting to see the step show." The student compared this 
party to a Kappa Alpha Psi party he attended at Wesleyan 
where blacks and whites came in equal numbers. "Inside it 
was booming, and you could tell that was the place to be 
that night on campus," he said. "It was kind of like one of 
those big Yale parties that everyone goes to--like the Safety 
Dance or the Saybrook Courtyard Party.'' 

The student said he does not want to join a black fra-
ternity because he sees them as removed from the Yale stu-
dent body and even from the black student community. 
Statistics from the Registrar's office support his claim. Of 
the 157 black males on the campus, 15, according to Lucas, 
have joined black fraternities. The New Haven chapter of 
Omega Psi Phi has only one member on the Yale campus. 

The predominately Jewish fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi 
appears the most casual in its treatment of the issue of eth-
nic identity. lcs members acknowledge that Jews do not 
share the embattled status of other ethnic groups on cam-
pus. "For Jews to come to Yale is not a big deal," said AE Pi 
brother Mike lchenwald (SM '95). "I don't think that you 
can see yourself as a Jew and a minority at Yale." He esti-
