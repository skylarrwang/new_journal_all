From 1701 to 1870, Yale remained a whites-only institution. After the admission of the first black undergraduate, for decades only a handful more followed. In the early 60s, Yale inched up the number of blacks to several per class, and by the end of the decade, as national consciousness focused upon such racial inequality, the university began to recruit actively. The stories below come from three African-American men who attended Yale at different periods during its transformation from white bastion to integrated institution. 


Growing up in New Haven, Levi Jackson (DC '50) always thought of Yale as the place where the rich kids went to school. Yale seemed unreachable not because he was black and virtually all Yalies were white, but because Yale students seemed so smart and wealthy. But Jackson's football coach at Hillhouse High School convinced him to apply to Yale. 


Yale accepted Jackson, and he deferred enrollment to serve in World War II. When he entered in 1946, the G.I. Bill financed $500 of his $600 tuition. To save money, Jackson lived at home in Westville and took the trolley to campus each morning. He made the varsity football team as a freshman and divided his time between practice, study, and work. While his teammates dined at the "training table," which served special meals to athletes, Jackson waited tables in Commons to pay for his meals. 


Jackson's excitement in attending Yale screened out some of the racism he encountered. "I went around in a daze. I never realized I'd be a student at Yale. It was like a fairy tale," said Jackson. "Everybody was good until they proved themselves bad." The kindness ofJackson's classmates also insulated him from some ugly racial incidents. One Saturday night in his senior year, Jackson took his wife to a fraternity dance. When an alumnus of the fraternity saw Jackson talking with some teammates, the man started moving toward him, saying, 'I'm gonna get that nigger.' Jackson's teammates formed a circle around him. As several football players escorted the man out, Jackson went on talking, unaware of what had happened. He did not even know about the incident until his wife told him as they left the dance. 


Jackson only began to feel truly part ofYale in his senior year, when he became the first black man tapped by three senior societies: Skull and Bones, Scroll and Key, and Berzelius. "I was told that if you were tapped by Skull and Bones you automatically got a $10,000-a-year job, but I wanted to earn my own way," said Jackson. He chose Berzelius. 


"Being in the society gave me the feeling that I belonged. I felt that I was finally getting the real Yale experience." 


In the early 60s, as national attention focused on legal discrimination in Southern school systems, Ivy League universities recognized that their admissions policies paralleled segregation. Admissions officers started to look tentatively for black applicants from the best inner-city public schools. At the same time, the first African-American students to attend prestigious prep schools began to apply to Yale. 


When Ronnie Wilmore (ES '65) entered Yale as one of four black students in his class, Yale's tiny black population shocked him. But unlike Jackson, Wilmore did have a small black peer group, and he quickly bonded with the other blacks in his class. Rather than feeling star-struck by Yale, Wilmore's black classmates wanted to change the institution. Together they lobbied to pick up the glacial pace of Yale's integration efforts. "The mere fact that there were four of us in a class was as racist as you could get," said Wilmore. The black students brought their concerns to then President A. Whitney Griswold. "We told Griswold that it wasn't right that at a great university like Yale there were only four blacks representing only two cities in our class," he recalled. 


While Wilmore and one of his roommates grew up in poor families, the other two came from middle-class backgrounds not that different from many white students at Yale. Income levels aside, the four found the bond of race to be a powerful uniting force, and they lived together in Ezra Stiles College after their freshman year. Their decision to room together demonstrated their need for solidarity. "We felt that we had no choice," said Wilmore. 


Throughout his time at Yale, Wilmore sensed that blacks seemed foreign to most Yale undergraduates. "These folks saw black people in the kitchen and cleaning up, but they did not see them as equals," he said. After growing up poor in New Haven, Wilmore found that his experience at Yale held special meaning. His dorm in Stiles stood just minutes away from the housing project where his mother lived. He went home frequently to see her and often bumped into her on the street. "Once I was on my way to Payne Whitney Gym, and I saw my mother waiting to catch the bus on Broadway. She had just gotten back from cleaning some white woman's home. I stopped, hugged, and kissed her," recalled Wilmore. "That was one of the few
