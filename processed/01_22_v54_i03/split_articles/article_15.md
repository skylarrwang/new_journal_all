J.
D. Wright ’24 shivered 
and curled into their 
sleeping bag. It was 
February 2021. It had snowed, 
and Davenport College’s heating 
wasn’t enough to ward off the chill 
in their dorm room. It was freez­
ing inside and out—cold enough 
for your teeth to chatter and your 
joints to ache and for you to pull 
all your old blankets from the 
closet. But J.D. had no blankets to 
bundle under, or any bedding at 
all, save for that thin sleeping bag. 
Yale had lost it all. 
J.D. wasn’t the only one to 
lose their things. As of Decem­
ber 2021, students have filed 
1104 claims to be reimbursed for 
lost items, some of which total in 
the tens of thousands of dollars. 
When the pandemic began in 
March 2020, students had already 
left for spring break, which made 
it almost impossible for out-of-
state and international students to 
return to New Haven and retrieve 
their things. 
So Yale stepped in, at first 
retrieving only essential items but 
later expanding their operations 
to packing up all student belong­
ings. Once the items were packed, 
they offered to ship them home 
or store them for the student. If a 
student opted to store their items, 
they could later pick the items up 
themselves or ask Yale to move 
their stuff into their new dorm 
room upon their return to cam­
pus, in spring or fall 2021. 
After J.D. spent a year stranded 
in Illinois because of the pan­
demic, they expected that their 
bedding (and all their other pos­
sessions) would be awaiting them 
in their dorm room as Yale had 
promised. But, when J.D. arrived, 
they found that Yale hadn’t kept 
its word: Most of their things, 
including their bedding, were 
missing. 
J.D. couldn’t afford to replace 
any of it—they’d come to Yale 
that semester with only $90 to 
their name, they recall. It wasn’t 
until six weeks later that Yale 
reimbursed them $800—the total 
value of all their lost items. But 
it was warmer by then, and they 
needed to start saving up to fly 
back home. So, they deposited the 
money instead of spending it on 
bedding, or warm clothes. 
Worse 
than 
the 
bedding, 
though, was the loss of their 
books. The books were “parts of 
the people they were from,” full 
of letters and well-wishes for the 
future, J.D. explains. They miss 
their Polaroids, too—“the physical 
representation of [their] memo­
ries,” of friends, of home. They 
wrote everything they lost down 
when filing for reimbursement 
from Yale, so they’re not wor­
ried about forgetting. But they 
miss the comfort of holding their 
memories in their hands. 
“Did they ever explain where 
my stuff went?” J.D. repeats my 
question. 
After a beat: “No.” 
Half-amused, J.D. tells me that 
Yale lost their stuff again this 
semester. They had stored their 
items with Yale over the sum­
mer as part of a summer storage 
program offered through Dav­
enport College, but when they 
arrived on campus this fall, they 
once again found that all their 
items had vanished.  Though Yale 
returned J.D.’s stuff to them after 
two weeks, the University still 
hasn’t explained this second disap­
pearance, nor has the University 
explained how it misplaced the 
items of over a thousand students, 
who, when they finally returned 
to campus, opened the cardboard 
boxes littering their rooms and 
found nothing but disappoint­
ment. 
WHEN SHIT HIT 
THE FAN 
“No one knew that there was 
going to be a pandemic,” says 
Kathryn Vieillard, Deputy Direc­
tor of Yale Conferences and 
Events (Yale C&E), the campus 
office that was responsible for 
shipping and storing students’ 
belongings. She is excited to talk, 
like someone who has something 
to say but hasn’t had the chance to 
say it, and before I can even ask 
my first question, she’s taking me 
back to the beginning, when it all 
started in March 2020.
In an email sent March 3, 
2020—the Tuesday before spring 
break—Dean Marvin Chun urged 
students to “consider bringing 
any items [they] will want with 
[them] if [their] return to campus 
is delayed,” as COVID began to 
disrupt travel around the world. 
But the pandemic still felt like an 
impossibility, and, free from mid­
terms and high on the promise of 
beach nirvanas, students didn’t lis­
ten. So, when the pandemic came 
and Yale moved classes online, 
many students didn’t have what 
they needed, and Yale was at a 
loss for how to return their things. 
They turned to Vieillard at Yale 
C&E to help them deliver essential 
items home to students. 
At the time, the task seemed 
simple, so Vieillard agreed. She 
volunteered 
herself 
and 
“As of December 
2021, students have 
filed 1104 claims to 
be reimbursed for 
lost items, some of 
which total in the 
tens of thousands of 
dollars.”
