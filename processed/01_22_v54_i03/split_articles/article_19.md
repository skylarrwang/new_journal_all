means. Perhaps we need to rethink 
monuments themselves.


On June 24, 2020, a large crane 
appeared in Wooster Square Park. 
Mayor Justin Elicker, citing “many 
leaders in the Italian Commu­
nity” who helped the city arrive 
at the decision, had unexpectedly 
ordered the statue’s removal just 
two days earlier, after the city Parks 
Commission voted to remove it. 
In the company of supporters and 
protesters, Columbus was trans­
planted to an orange platform on 
a truck, tethered with thick straps, 
and driven off. The statue’s base 
remained, protected by an iron 
black fence and a moat of tulips. 
On the day of the statue’s 
removal, the Italian American Her­
itage Group—a local organization 
made up of about 10,000 Italian 
Americans from New Haven and 
the surrounding area—filed a law­
suit against the city over Colum­
bus’s removal. A year later, on the 
one-year anniversary of the statue’s 
removal, a handful of the group’s 
members and other Italian Ameri­
cans gathered at the statue’s vacant 
base and hung up a sign that read, 
“ALL LIVES MATTER,” signed 
off: “From your Italian Ameri­
can Friends.” By then, the Italian 
American Heritage group’s request 
to nullify the vote to remove the 
statue had been dismissed. 
The IAWGNH decided to take 
up the fight; they filed their own 
lawsuit in October 2021. Accord­
ing to Calzetta, it rests on three 
claims: first, that “the mayor chose 
one ethnic group over another”; 
second, “a denial of due process” in 
the decision-making to remove the 
statue, which, they claimed, had 
violated Civil Rights protections, 
as well as First and Fourteenth 
Amendment rights; and third, “an 
inability to enjoy the park” where 
the statue once stood. Their law­
yer, Patricia Cofrancesco, who 
represented the Italian American 
Heritage Group before them, is 
presenting their case pro-bono. 
The rest of the legal expenses are 
being funded by local IAWGNH 
fundraising events, including an 
annual fashion show.
Calzetta and her colleagues are 
optimistic they will win, because 
they feel they have support from 
community 
members. 
Elicker 
has been publicly dismissive of 
the campaign. “This suit is with­
out cause or merit,” he wrote in 
an October statement, “We will 
vigorously defend this case. The 
plaintiff, in bringing it, is drain­
ing city resources away from more 
pressing issues before the city.” 


Calzetta considers herself a poli­
tician. She flaunts her campaigning 
for the preservation of the memory 
of Columbus at the New Haven 
Historical Society, where she is a 
member, and her “antipornogra­
phy work,” which includes fight­
ing for the closure of a strip club 
she feared would increase crime 
rates according to the New Haven 
Register, which described her as 
an “outraged neighbor.” She was 
also named to the Wooster Square 
Monument 
Committee, 
tasked 
with selecting an idea for a replace­
ment statue that represents Italian 
Americans; in August, the com­
mittee selected a replacement, and 
it has yet to be officially approved 
before the eighteen months of fab­
rication and installation of the new 
statue can begin.
During our interview, Calzetta 
freely reprimanded New Haven 
politicians for their roles in remov­
ing the statue. She called Congress­
woman Rosa DeLauro, a Wooster 
Square-born 
Italian-American 
who strongly opposed the statue, 
“an unfortunate congresswoman 
who turned her back on every­
thing she believed in for political 
reasons,” and chided Mayor Jus­
tin Elicker as a “very weak man,” 
“terrible terrible,” and, at the end 
of a string of more pejoratives, 
“a mayor who did not care about 
Columbus.” 
Calzetta cares about Columbus. 
She cares about Columbus to the 
point that New Haven-born and 
raised Italian American Histo­
rian Anthony Riccio calls her the 
“voice” of all Italians who oppose 
the removal of the Columbus 
statue. Columbus “was a tough 
governor,” Calzetta euphemizes, 
“but he did magnificent kinds of 
things: improve the lives of the 
Indians, the country became open 
for trading around the world, 
improving the lives of even the 
people who came to settle here.” 
When asked about how she weighs 
this supposed magnificence with 
Columbus’ responsibility for the 
genocide of Indigenous peoples, 
Calzetta says, “don’t give me all 
this about how great and wonder­
ful they [Indigenous peoples] are,” 
and adds that “they are hell bent 
on trying to destroy Columbus. 
And by destroying all this, they are 
discriminating against the Italian 
American people.” 


Monuments are 
limited artifacts–
and, ironically, 
Calzetta and 
IAWGNH’s lawsuit 
gestures towards 
this fact.


Beginning in the late nineteenth 
century, as scores of Italian immi­
grants settled in the Northeast of 
the United States, Columbus’s 
legacy was settling, too. In 1892, 
President Benjamin Harrison pro­
claimed Columbus Day as a one-
time national celebration. But 
Italian Americans took the hol­
iday and ran with it, organizing 
celebrations across the country in 
the following years with the help 
of sponsorship and state lobbying 
from the Knights of Columbus; 
soon enough, Columbus Day was 
a federal holiday. Simultaneously, 
Columbus monuments cropped up 
nationally: often funded by pri­
vate donations from Italians, these 
monuments were a point of pride, 
ceremony, and a new, hybrid Ital­
ian American nationalism. 
New 
Haven’s 
statue 
was 
unveiled in Wooster Square on 
October 12, 1892—the day after 
the first national celebration of 
Columbus Day. According to the 
New Haven Register’s archives, at 
the statue’s unveiling ceremony, an 
Italian-American speaker declared: 
“May this statue serve to eliminate 
whatever distinction there may be 
between Italians and Americans, 
and may it keep peace and pros­
perity for all future time.”
In New Haven and nationally, 
these 
Columbus-centered 
fix­
tures helped reinforce convenient 
myths: that Columbus was Ital­
ian (he wasn’t; he was born in the 
independent republic of Genoa 
four centuries before Italy was uni­
fied), that he “discovered” America 
(he never set foot in North Amer­
ica), that he was the “first immi­
grant” to the United States (the 
United States, of course, hadn’t 
yet been formed, and Columbus’s 
expedition was commercial, mili­
tary, and resulted in the genocide 
of millions of Indigenous people). 
But these myths had motive far 
greater than pride: Columbus was 
“central to the process through 
which [Italian-Americans] were 
fully ratified as white during the 
20th century,” as author and edi­
torial writer Brent Staples writes 
in his October 12, 2019 New York 
Times op-ed entitled “How Italians 
Became White.” In Italy, South­
ern Italians had faced discrimina­
tion from whiter Northern Ital­
ians, and immigration offered no 
escape. Abuse in America often 
took the form of slurs, exclusion 
from schools and labor unions, 
and consignment to segregated 
church pews. In the South, Italians 
were also subject to some of the 
mob violence routinely terrorizing 
Black Americans: in 1891, eleven 
Italian Americans were lynched in 
New Orleans—President Harri­
son’s 1892 Columbus Day procla­
mation was a direct response. Fac­
ing racialized violence, Italians had 
a choice between aligning with 
whiteness or with people of color, 
a choice they and other European 
immigrants were privy to because 
their new American identities 
were still undefined. They chose 
whiteness, and with it the rac­
ist violence of white supremacy 
essential to proving themselves 
as white. As the legal scholar and 
author of Uncle Tom: Why Blacks 
Must Police Racial Loyalty Brando 
Simeo Starkey writes: “[European 
immigrants] watched whites abuse 
blacks, mimicked whatever they 
saw and whiteness—the carrot they 
had long reached for—slowly came 
closer to their grasp.” 
Columbus’s role was thus two-
fold: he was an instrument for 
grabbing the carrot and a sym­
bol for maintaining a grip on it. 
Professor Thomas Allen Har­
ris, a Senior Lecturer in African 
American Studies and Film and 
Media Studies at Yale, spoke to 
me about the artifice embedded 
in the Columbus hero narrative. 
“Who decided that Columbus was 
[a hero] and how did that happen? 
That was a creation of manufac­
ture,” said Harris. The Columbus 
hero narrative, Harris told me, 
was a way for Italian-Americans 
to ennoble themselves—which all 
communities seek to do in one 
way or another. But the myth of 
Columbus didn’t just ennoble Ital­
ian Americans or make them more 
acceptable to the white majority. It 
made them white.


Calzetta was born and raised in 
Wooster Square, but now she lives 
in Branford. Riccio, who has inter­
viewed hundreds of former resi­
dents of Wooster Square, describes 
the area in his book The Italian 
American Experience in New Haven 
as a space where tradition lives on, 
where “one can still catch glimpses 
of the old neighborhood and imag­
ine it in its heyday.” When I inter­
viewed Calzetta at the Twin Pines 
Diner, I expected her to wax sen­
timental about Columbus’s role in 
Wooster Square’s Italian American 
tradition. But little sentimentality 
was detectable. She didn’t express 
passion for the neighborhood as 
an Italian American hub. Despite 
“enjoyment of the park” being 
the basis for the third claim of her 
lawsuit, Calzetta seems indifferent 
about the neighborhood. 
“It means nothing to me. As far 
as I'm concerned, Wooster Square 
contemporary, they cleaned up a 
major slum,” said Calzetta, refer­
encing an urban renewal project 
that rehabilitated the industrial 
area and uprooted Italian-Amer­
icans 
from 
Wooster 
Square. 
Addressing the square in the sec­
ond person, she said, “No, you’re 
not the center. You’re not better 
than anybody else.” According 
to Calzetta, Wooster Square is 
important mainly because it dis­
plays Italian-American culture to 
others. “[The statue’s] been there 
one hundred twenty years, and 
Chapel Street’s a main street. So 
you drive by, the statue’s there,” 
she said. Calzetta is not personally 
invested in Wooster Square nor its 
park—and perhaps her investment 
in Columbus isn’t personal, either. 
Thanks in part to the Colum­
bus myth, Italian Americans have 
been securely ratified as white for 
over half a century. Claims that 
Italian Americans face racism and 
discrimination in the twenty-first 
century, then, seem hopelessly out 
of date. But if their whiteness is no 
longer in danger, why do so many 
Italian Americans feel threatened 
by the reevaluation of Colum­
bus’s legacy and the removal of 
his monuments? Perhaps Cal­
zetta’s impersonal, unsentimental 
investment in Columbus provides 
a clue. “You drive by, the statue’s 
there.” Calzetta is more interested 
in imposing the symbolism of 
Columbus on others than in pre­
serving Columbus as a symbol of 
Italian American heritage. Colum­
bus no longer needs to symbolize 
inclusion; Italian Americans have 
firmly achieved it. Instead, he now 
seems to embody only the ugliness 
of his historical legacy—the preser­
vation of a white supremacist sta­
tus quo and a tradition of racialized 
violence. 


The day the Columbus statue 
was removed from Wooster Square 
Park, Norm Clement visited the 
park. A Confederate Quinnip­
iac Native and a member of the 
Penobscot tribe, Clement also 
serves as a community organizer, 

In New Haven and 
nationally, these 
Columbus-
centered fixtures 
helped reinforce 
convenient 
myths. But these 
myths had motive 
far greater than 
pride.
