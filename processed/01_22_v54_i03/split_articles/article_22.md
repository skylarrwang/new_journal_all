and they knew where the best res­
taurants were. “Even though the 
front of the book was the news 
and the investigative pieces, peo­
ple of all backgrounds counted on 
it to know where to go out and 
have fun, wrestle with ideas about 
culture. It was fun, it was contro­
versial, it was wild.”

But the paper’s days of youth­
ful rebellion did not last. By the 
late nineteen-nineties, alternative 
weeklies “were making so much 
money, and their owners were 
getting older, that all over the 
country, big companies, mains­
tream corporate newsrooms, were 
buying these weeklies because they 
thought they were cash cows,” 
Bass said. In 1999, satisfied with 
the success of the paper he created, 
Advocate founder Geoff Robinson 
sold the paper to Times-Mirror, 
a major media conglomerate and 
the parent company of the Hart­
ford Courant—the paper Robinson 
and his colleague Edward Matys 
had abandoned in order to found 
the Advocate. Business-savvy as 
they may have seemed, the new 
owners “didn’t have the DNA of 
those founders, they didn’t exist 
to challenge established norms,” 
Bass said. These new owners were 
interested in cash and cash alone. 
To Bass, it was no surprise that the 
paper eventually tanked.

Mark Oppenheimer, now a 
lecturer in Yale’s English depart­
ment and coordinator of the Yale 
Journalism Initiative, served as an 
editor of the Advocate from 2004 
through 2006. “By the time I got 
there, you could no longer show 
up to work,” he pauses, “on subs­
tances. I think there was probably 
too much fear of lawsuits.”

Oppenheimer still found the 
Advocate a welcome change of 
pace from the Courant. Compa­
red with the three- hundred- per­
son newsroom at the Courant, the 
Advocate had a staff of roughly 
ten. “It was more like being part 
of an elite strike force, instead of 
having a boss, a deputy boss, and 
all that bureaucracy,” Oppenhei­
mer said.

The death of local newspapers, 
and the struggles of contempo­
rary journalism, are frequently 
blamed on the internet. Prior to 
the internet, a venue like Toad’s 
would have relied on advertising 
in papers such as the Advocate to 
reach their desired audience. With 
the rise of the internet, however, 
local businesses no longer nee­
ded the Advocate to reach their 
audience. The loss of ad revenue 
created a problem for the papers. 
Nevertheless, Bass insists that the 
issue that actually felled the Advo­
cate and similar papers was much 
simpler: they weren’t interesting 
anymore. 

said. “So, if you wrote a lede and it 
totally sucked, your editor would 
say, ‘What a great lede—how can 
we make it better?’ even though 
you misspelled everything and it 
was total crap.”

Unlike these papers, the New 
Haven Independent, founded in 
2005 and published exclusively 
online, has remained free of cor­
porate influence and, according 
to its editor, Bass, is committed 
to staying that way. Despite the 
inroads the corporate media has 
made into independent media in 
the past four decades, Bass remains 
confident that the Independent of 
today lives up to the best values of 
independent journalism. 

“I find that with the Indepen­
dent—I’m closer with my reader­
ship, I have the most diverse rea­
dership I’ve ever had, and it costs 
the least,” Bass said. “The ability 
to challenge corporate control and 
do independent media is by far 
greater than it’s ever been. The 
alt-weeklies were nothing com­
pared to what’s around now.” 

From perusing the Independent’s 
website or spending an afternoon 
in their office, no one would guess 
the paper’s roots in the alternative 
press. Today, Bass’s hair is short, 
and his office has an atmosphere 
of middle-class professionalism. A 
twenty-year old looking to rebel 
would do better to trip acid and 
burn an American flag than intern 
at the Independent. But, if today’s 
Independent 
might 
disappoint 
adrenaline-seeking college leftists, 
that’s not particularly surprising. 
It’s been forty years since Bass was 
twenty.


By the late nineties—once the 
Advocate had been bought by 
Times-Mirror—alternative 
wee­
klies were owned by “boring, 
corporate types—their main con­
cern was not getting sued,” Bass

**Connectic*nt Magazine**
**Page number(s): 38-39**

Connectic*nt
When I walked into their apart­
ment, Zoe Jensen and Mariana 
Plaez were sitting by their kitchen 
table. Overflowing with maga­
zine cutouts—text, images—the 
table was barely able to contain 
the scraps. I felt that if I sneezed 
too hard I might send the whole 
arrangement flying. There were 
only five days until their deadline, 
and they had lots of cutting, fol­
ding, gluing, and re-gluing ahead 
of them. 

Zoe Jensen and Mariana Palaez 
are two of the three editors of the 
recently-born Connectic*nt Maga­
zine. Spell- check can forget the 
red underline. Meant as “a love 
letter to the state of Connecti­
cut,” the zine was born as a reac­
tion against the dismissive attitude 
towards the state that Jensen and 
Palaez found obnoxiously com­
mon. “I know so many people 
that are just like Connecticut’s so 
lame, there’s no one cool in Con­
necticut, and a lot of these kids 
will move to New York or some­
thing like that because they have 
the means to do that,” Palaez said. 
Palaez herself was eager to escape 
the state when she graduated from 
high school. But she couldn’t 
afford Boston University, so she 
went to the University of Connec­
ticut instead. “And then I found 
cool people there!” Palaez said. 
“I’m like damn, there’s cool peo­
ple everywhere! But Connecticut 
just doesn’t get the love.” Jensen 
herself left Connecticut after high 
school to attend film school in Los 
Angeles, but came back a year and 
a half later. “I just missed this place 
too much,” she said.

In the zine, many of the sub­
missions are collages. It summons 
an elementary school era of simple 
joy, a time before pinging noti­
fications and round- the- clock 
stress, when it was perfectly natu­
ral to spend an afternoon cutting 
shapes out of magazines, gluing 
them together, and repeating. 

But the child-like play that goes 
into the zine doesn’t keep it from 
addressing issues worthy of atten­
tion. The magazine’s October 
issue featured a full-page graphic 
lampooning the University of 
Connecticut’s proclaimed com­
mitment to human rights. “Human 
rights is an interesting way to spell 
Imperialism,” muses the graphic. 
The page mentions the Univer­
sity’s partnerships with military 
contractors Lockheed Martin and 
Sikorsky and the school’s part­
nership with “the world’s biggest 
terrorist org (US military).” Deli­
vered without the self-seriousness 
of other publications, the charge 
hits hard. 

I asked if there had been any par­
ticular intention behind the vul­
garity in the magazine’s name. “I 
chose it because 
I thought it was 
funny,” Jen­
sen 
said, 
laughing. 
“I 
really 
just 
thou­
ght it would 
be a silly little 
thing for a few 
friends.” 

Now, 
with 
roughly 
1,500 copies sold 
and 
consistent 
interest from local 
advertisers, 
Jen­
sen and Palaez must 
come to terms with 
just how popular their 
zine has become.

Talking with Jen­
sen and Palaez, I con­
sidered the similarity 
between their zine and 
the underground press 
of the sixties. The edi­
tors bragged about how 
few conventions of newspaper 
creation they adhere to. “Fuck a 
style guide,” Palaez said, laughing. 
As editors, their main job is sim­
ply to select which submissions to 
include in a given issue. They’re 
not interested in fact-checking, 
or telling a contributor how to 
better word a sentence. Rea­
lly, they just want to create a 
low-stress medium for people to 
express whatever it is they do, or 
don’t, feel like saying. But, like 
the papers of the nineteen- sixties 
that preceded it, Connectic*nt has 
been very popular. I wondered if 
the zine’s promise of profitability 
might pique the interests of any 
aspiring business-owners. Jensen 
herself mentioned that she would 
love to work on Connectic*nt full-
