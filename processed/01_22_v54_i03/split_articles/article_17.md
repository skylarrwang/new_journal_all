AWARD -WINNING 
SERVICE
“Considering 
how 
crazy 
it 
was,” Davenport College’s Head 
of Operations Shaffrona Phil­
lip-Christie tells me, “[it’s] shock­
ing we didn’t lose more items.” 
She 
wishes 
the 
residential 
college offices had been more 
involved in the process, but she 
tells me that in the big picture—
while some items were lost—many 
more were delivered, and Yale 
C&E did eventually find some of 
the items that went missing. With 
a staff of only twenty-two coordi­
nating thousands of student items, 
it does seem miraculous that more 
wasn’t lost, all the while helping 
first responders and those sick 
with COVID. 

“I am so proud of my staff,” 
Yale C&E’s Vieillard says. “They 
became like detectives.” 

According to Vieillard, when 
COVID restrictions were relaxed 
and allowed her staff to go into 
closed buildings, they would go 
look for student items them­
selves, often becoming personally 
invested in the case. “We're…on 
the phone, talking to kids,” she 
recalls, “trying to figure out what 
happened, why somebody had the 
wrong box, or why they didn't 
have any boxes, or why they were 
missing certain things.” They 
wanted to make it right. Out of 
1104 claims for missing items, 
Vieillard’s staff was able to resolve 
273. (They reimbursed the other 
831.)

For their service to the Uni­
versity, the team won a Linda 
Lorimer award, which accord­
ing to its website “recognize[s] 
individuals and teams among the 
Yale staff who have distinguished 
themselves through a commit­
ment to excellence and innova­
tive thinking.” Still, this apparent 
success is hard to reconcile with 
the feelings of students. “Maybe 
I’m being naive,” J.D. says. “But 
it can’t be that hard to store some­
thing.” Elko, when I ask how he 
feels, calls the team “incompetent.” 


**Title: Our Deepest Sympathies**

OUR DEEPEST 
SYMPATHIES 
“Sometimes, 
[a 
student] 
is 
missing something, not to coin 
the credit card company ad, that 
is ‘priceless,’” Vieillard explains. 
“Something your grandmother 
gave you, or a note from some­
one you can’t find now, or what­
ever it was. There were plenty of 
heart-breaking stories about heir­
looms, which people may or may 
not be reconnected with.” 

Vieillard says her team has a sys­
tem in which they track a student’s 
quest to find an item—whether a 
locket, or a diary, or Polaroids—
from beginning to end. They 
mark each development, from the 
moment they are contacted until 
they find the item, or until Yale 
C&E determines that it’s unfind­
able.


**Title: Some Things You Can't Replace**

SOME THINGS YOU 
CAN'T REPLACE
My grandfather sent my grand­
mother cross-country love letters 
when they were college students 
in the nineteen-fifties and sixties. 
She mailed them to me in the fall 
of my first year. I remember keep­
ing them in the bottom drawer of 
my desk, with school supplies and 
cards my mom sent me. When I 
was homesick, I would take them 
out and read them. I liked to feel 
the weight of their love in my 
hands. My grandfather died when 
I was four, so I never knew him, 
but I got to know him better 
through those letters, when he 
was eighteen and felt out of place 
at Yale, just like me, hundreds of 
miles from Fort Worth, Texas. 

When I went home for spring 
break in March 2020, I didn’t 
think about the letters. Now, I 
can’t remember if I made sure to 
put them back in the drawer, or if I 
left them on the coffee table in our 
common room when I left. Some­
times, I wonder if they fell under 
my bed as I was packing for spring 
break, or if I threw them into my 
luggage and forgot about them. 
I’d just turned nineteen and was 
too distracted by the Jimmy Fal­
lon tickets in my back pocket to 
worry when Dean Chun warned 
us to take what we needed. 

But I do remember that I felt 
thankful when my stuff was 
shipped back home to Texas. 
I knew that it must have been a 
nightmare for Yale to coordinate. 
Almost all my things were there, 
though all the papers were mixed 
up and my mug had been chipped. 
My notebooks were there. So was 
my bedding, and my ballet shoes, 
and the photo my mom and I took 
in front of Princeton. 

The letters weren’t.
