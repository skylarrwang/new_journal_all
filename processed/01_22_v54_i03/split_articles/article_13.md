THE  NEW  JOURNAL
After considerable difficulty, I 
ended up with four ugly corner 
pieces. I still had to make my cen­
ter piece out of the glue chip glass. 
On my first three attempts, the 
glass snapped in half immediately.
1.) Bad:
My second cut was clean again. 
Just two left. I squeezed my run­
ning pliers, and—disaster.
Last one. I scored the glass, 
squeezed the grozers, felt it crack 
all at once. I held up my star to 
show Jayne. 
2.) Worse:
3.) Awful:
I’d wasted at least a square foot 
of Jayne’s glass by then, and I was 
starting to feel guilty. On attempt 
four, I tried angling the running 
pliers toward the curve of the 
score. Behold: it broke left and 
cracked clean.
“You’re starting to learn the 
properties of glass,” Jayne told me. 
I felt proud. 
“It’s nerve wracking,” I said.
“It’s supposed to be fun!” she 
replied.
I felt genuinely distraught. Why 
is this so hard? I thought. What 
could I be doing wrong? I’m wast­
ing Jayne’s glass for no reason at 
all. I wanted to apologize but 
didn’t want to show her what I’d 
done. So I just stood there for a 
while and pretended I was making 
great progress. 

Jayne was utterly unbothered. 
She cut me another sheet of glue 
chip glass, and I pulled myself 
together. Cut one was clean, but 
I hesitated on cut two. I’d have to 
squeeze the running pliers on the 
sharp point of the glass, rather than 
on a flat edge. It didn’t feel right. I 
asked Jayne. She came over slowly 
from across the room. 
“I’m done tormenting you,” she 
said. She made a score an inch out­
side the Sharpie mark and picked 
up the grozers—a pair of pliers 
with a bottom jaw that curves up 
like an underbite—instead of the 
running pliers. Working from the 
side, she snapped her approximate 
score with the grozers, then made 
a perfect break along the Sharpie 
line. I’d been using the wrong 
technique, and she’d been letting 
me struggle.
On the third cut, I imitated 
Jayne: success.
“Hooray!” she said. 

Jayne seemed to take pity on me 
after that. I needed it—cutting the 
glass was more exacting than I’d 
expected. She had Francis help me 
line each glass piece in copper foil, 
paint the foil with flux, solder the 
pieces together, and frame it all in 
came. 

The next day, with Jayne’s guid­
ance, I rubbed patina onto the sol­
der, which darkened it from silver 
to dusky gray. Finally, I attached 
two metal rings to the frame, for 
hanging.  

It had taken me two days to make 
a suncatcher the size of a large slice 
of bread. The edges were jag­
ged, the foiling was shoddy, and 
the solder lines bulged. I couldn’t 
imagine making a full-sized win­
dow. But on the whole, I thought 
my piece was pretty. Back in my 
apartment, I propped it up on the 
windowsill, and the glue chip glass 
scattered the afternoon sunlight 
across the walls.
⬙
The glass in a cathedral win­
dow flows toward the ground one 
nanometer every billion years. 
This is beyond slow. The universe, 
for instance, is a little under 14 bil­
lion years old. I remember being 
told in middle school that glass was 
a liquid, but that’s only sort of true. 
Really, glass is something much, 
much stranger. If it’s a liquid, it’s a 
liquid stuck in time, or locked out

of time: an eternal liquid.
“Glass” is not a particular sub­
stance, it’s a category of substances. 
Anything can be glass if its mole­
cules are arranged chaotically like 
a liquid but feel rigid like a solid. 
Ordinary window glass is made 
from melted silica sand, but the­
oretically, almost any liquid could 
unlimited time to flow past one 
another, settle together, and reach 
the densest of all possible ran­
dom arrangements. Its molecules 
would look jumbled but would in 
fact follow a mysterious, invisible 
pattern (a “long-range amorphous 
order,” scientists call it). All glass—
from windows to eyeglasses to 
wineglasses to fiber optic cables—
is slowly, slowly approaching this 
true glass. As far as anyone knows, 
ideal glass has never existed in the 
history of the universe. It just takes 
too long to form. 

If you had billions and 
billions of years at your 
disposal, you might be able 
to catch the first glimpse 
of ideal glass. You might 
see a normal window, for 
instance, flow down into 
itself and gradually arrive at 
perfection. 
become a glass if you cool it fast 
enough. Plastics and hard candies 
are technically glass. You make 
glass by dropping a liquid’s tem­
perature so fast that its molecules 
can’t crystallize into a solid—they 
keep flowing, only slower and 
slower and slower.
No one can figure out why this 
happens. 
The 
Nobel-winning 
physicist Phillip W. Anderson 
once wrote that the nature of glass 
is “the deepest and most interest­
ing unsolved problem in solid state 
theory.”
Some people think glass is mat­
ter stuck between solid and liquid. 
They call it an amorphous solid or 
a supercooled liquid. Others think 
it’s something weirder—an imper­
fect reflection of a yet unwitnessed 
state of matter they call “ideal 
glass.” Ideal glass is what glass 
would become if its molecules had

cames apart, disassembled the win­
dow, and soaked the glass in water 
to help remove the old putty. She 
had spread the rubbing out on a 
table, and now she was fitting all 
the glass pieces back together with 
fresh came, working from the bot­
tom right to the top left corner. 
She had reached a row of blue, dia­
mond-shaped pieces near the bot­
tom. They looked like my troubled 
piece of glue chip glass, but a little 
smaller and a lot neater. 

She 
worked 
steadily, 
cycli­
cally. Her cycle went like this: Set 
the next piece of glass into place 
against the came. Tap the glass 
gently into the existing structure 
with a rubber mallet. Drive a flat-
sided nail into the table, flush with 
the edge of the glass piece, just to 
keep it still. Cut a new length of 
came. Remove the nail and press 
the came onto the exposed edge 
of the glass. Tap the came snug 
with the mallet. Use another nail 
to keep the came in place until the 
next piece is ready. Remove the 
nail and repeat. 

The aim of restoration is not to 
improve the original window, but 
to mirror it exactly. Where the 
original window used a thicker or 
thinner or flatter came, Jayne did 
too. The omega window displayed 
a technique called “cross weaving,” 
in which the vertical and hori­
zontal cames alternated long and 
short. Jayne replicated it. Molding 
the soft came with fingertips dark 
from the lead, she wove a tapestry 
of metal and glass.
Soon, the restored windows will 
be hauled up again the same way 
they came down. Jayne will load 
them in her trunk and drive them 
to Stony Creek Congregational 
Church. A man will carry one of 
them up a precarious ladder. The 
window will be slotted into the 
opening, where it will rest against 
metal bars. Thin wires that Jayne 
will have soldered to the came will 
be twisted around these bars to 
hold the window in place. The sun 
will catch the glass, and it’ll ripple 
orange, yellow, green. Then the 
other five will go back in, and it’ll 
be over, and Jayne will never again 
restore windows of this magni­
tude.
“It feels… fine,” she said. It feels 
fine to be done. Of course, after 
working in studios for close to fifty 
years, it’s sad to leave the last one. 
“But it’s time,” she said. Then she 
was quiet for a while. 

Recently, Jayne hired someone 
to convert a shed in her yard into 
a proper home studio. Now it has 
air conditioning, heating, painted 
walls, and plenty of windows. 
“It’s so light and airy,” she said. 
“They’ve done a wonderful job.” 
When she leaves the Branford stu­
dio and moves home, she’ll spend 
her days in that shed making orig­
inal pieces, trying out new tech­
niques, and reveling in retirement. 
Her neighbors, in Short Beach, are 
excited for her. Some of them have 
asked her to host an open studio so 
they can see the new place. Peo­
ple call out to her from the street, 
Jayne said. They yell: “That shed is 
so beautiful!”
This isn’t the end for Jayne. She’s 
settling down gradually, like glass. 
It’s not yet time to call it quits—
not when she can wake up in the 
morning, walk to her shed full of 
light, and work all day until the 
sun sinks in the west and flares in 
the windows one last time before 
it sets.
