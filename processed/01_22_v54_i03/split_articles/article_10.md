ost Yale students have probably never seen 
New Haven on Christmas Day, or New 
Year’s Eve, or the first few days of Janu­
ary when everything is dead quiet on Elm 
Street and only a few footprints dot the snow on Cross 
Campus. A lot of international students have. There 
is a particular point at the beginning of most school 
breaks when I notice the exodus. The kids with suit­
cases wait on street corners, in front of their dorms, 
by shuttle stops, outside Phelps Gate. They have their 
phones in their hands, making sure their ride will be 
on time to scoop them up. But then, a few hours later, 
the kids with suitcases are gone, and I begin to take 
stock of the stragglers left wandering down Broad­
way at 4 p.m. “Oh, I recognise them from the inter­
national students’ orientation,” I think to myself.

It has always been hard for international students 
to go home during shorter vacations, like Fall Break 
or Thanksgiving Break—a few days don't cut it for 
a trip to Australia or Hong Kong or Ghana. There’s 
no Metro-North to China, and your parents can’t 
pick you up and drive you back to Kenya while you 
sleep in the backseat. Still, longer breaks, over winter 
and summer, usually allow international students the 
time to visit home and see their families. But, since 
March 10, 2020, when President Salovey sent out 
his pandemic-induced email instructing all students 
to remain home or return home as soon as possible, 
international students have been navigating govern­
ment quarantines, border closures, flight cancella­
tions, and heightened travel risks. For many of us, this 
has meant being stuck in the U.S., usually in New 
Haven, for the longest we ever have been. 
Alara Degirmenci ’23, who is from Istanbul, stayed 
in New Haven for over eighteen months without see­
ing her family over the pandemic. Ha Uyen Nguyen 
’23 still hasn’t been back to Vietnam since winter break 
during her first year, over three years ago. Teigist 
‘Tiggy’ Taye ’22, my roommate, was stuck in New 
Haven for over a year and a half before she returned 
to Kenya this past summer. Mimi Kostoska ’21 spent a 
year in her Dwight Street apartment before she could 
fly home to Macedonia. I arrived back in New Haven 
to start my junior year in early August 2020, and I 
haven’t been home to Australia since. Almost every 
international student has a story like these. 

This isn’t a cry for pity, though. Many of us who 
were stuck here over the pandemic made a home; we 
found ways to create family, to support each other, 
and to stop ourselves from going insane as the time 
There’s no Metro-North to 
China, and your parents can’t 
pick you up and drive you 
back to Kenya while you sleep 
in the backseat.

stretched on and on. My roommate Tiggy has a kind 
of brain fog when remembering the winter break 
we spent together last year. “To be honest, I don’t 
remember a lot of it,” she texted me. “There were 
some extremes. I remember getting very drunk with 
my roommate [me] and taking out the trash in our 
underwear in the freezing snow because ‘Why the 
fuck not?’ I remember telling myself that it would 
be a great time to make a lot of paintings. I think 
I made about two little ones the whole holiday.” 

Despite every intention to stay mentally healthy and 
paint and do yoga and read even one book over the 
break, we lost our sense of time together. We stayed 
up till 4 a.m. painting the walls in our living room, we 
watched all of Bridgerton, and we drew giant faces in 
the snow outside our house in the middle of the night. 
Tiggy and I lived in a six-bedroom house last 
year and our American roommates dropped like flies 
around the holidays, except for one, Jordan, who also 
stayed to celebrate Christmas and New Year’s with 
us. We gave each other little presents we bought 
from deserted stores on Chapel Street, we decorated 
a Christmas tree in our living room, and we watched 
Love Actually. We made a big dinner and invited over 
Ha Uyen and her roommate Michelle, who couldn’t 
go home to California. We drank mulled wine and 
sat at a table like a proper family. We said what we 
were grateful for, we shared a highlight of the year, 
and we probably avoided the topic of home. This was 
it for the time being, this was home. Tiggy remem­
bers our makeshift party of five people that we hosted 
to ring in the new year: “We had a very small New 
Year’s Eve celebration which included projecting the 
ball drop on our wall and wearing cowboy boots.” 

We didn’t have enough people to make three pairs 
who could kiss at midnight, but it didn’t matter; five 
people felt like a crowd that winter. 

Alara also remembers last year in New Haven 
as one filled with moments of pseudo-family and 
root-building in this city. When I messaged her about 
how she feels after being in this city for so long, she 
sent this reply: “I love how small New Haven is that I 
run into friends on the streets all the time with whom 
I can exchange smiles and Hi’s with that make me 
feel at home and gives a sense of belonging.” Having 
moved off campus last year, she also recalls the spe­
cial moments of hosting and being hosted in homey 
spaces in New Haven:  “I think last year having a lot 
of small gatherings and dinners at people's apartments 
during the pandemic made it feel a lot more like home 
and family.” 

But no matter how many dinner parties and Friends­
givings and Friendsmases you attend, it’s still tough to 
be caught between two countries. Mimi remembers 
struggling being away from family over the holidays. 
“Last winter was pretty lonely and difficult especially 
since this was the longest time I was away from home 
and the first Christmas and New Years I spent not at 
home,” she texted me. Over winter break, Mimi and 
I hung out in her apartment on Dwight Street, just 
a block down from my house. We watched episodes 
of Friday Night Dinner and she gave me a three-hour 
lesson about Balkan history before I trudged home 
through several feet of untouched snow. Mimi and I 
hardly ever hung out during the school year, but over 
the break we did—when we needed it. Mimi loves 
to talk about Macedonia and I love to listen. When I 
texted her about how she felt about her relationship to 
home, she replied with this message: “I realized that 
when I don’t go home for longer than 6 months I start 
to lose that part of me, the Macedonian part…That’s 
why I decided that I will go this winter even if it’s 
for two weeks. Luckily I have the privilege to do so.” 

Mimi is counting down the days (twenty-four, as of 
our interview) until she flies back to Macedonia.

As news of the Omicron variant started breaking 
in late November, we faced a familiar crisis. As I am 
writing this piece, we are still waiting for any conclu­
sive news about how the new strain may impact win­
ter travels. Ha Uyen is planning to return to Vietnam 
for the first time in three years. I have a flight booked 
to go home after my finals finish. Tiggy is going to 
spend Christmas with her family in Kenya. Alara can’t 
wait to be with her parents in Turkey. Will any of 
us get home? Will borders close again? Will stricter 
quarantines come back? Will we be able to get back 
to the US? 

Tiggy reminds me that we have roots here now; 
we have a little international family that could spend 
Christmas together again. We could decorate another 
tree and glaze a ham for three hours on the morning 
of the 25th. We would be grateful for it. We would 
have some semblance of normalcy. But, truthfully, 
after a year and a half in this city, I think we all just 
want to be the kids with the suitcases.
