THE  NEW  JOURNAL
Yale C&E team to help plan the 
retrieval of essential items, like lap­
tops, textbooks, and passports. At 
first, it felt manageable—only 550 
students had requested that Yale 
retrieve items for them. Vieillard’s 
team contacted two moving com­
panies, Dorm Room Movers and 
Meyer; ordered gloves and hand 
sanitizer; and coordinated vol­
unteers from the dining halls and 
their HR department to help get 
students what they needed most 
for this initial retrieval of items. 
But on the eve of executing this 
plan, Yale administrators asked 
Yale C&E for help on another 
front. They needed Yale C&E to 
clear the rooms on Old Campus of 
all student belongings so that Yale 
graduate students could live there 
and safely socially distance. Then 
the state of Connecticut said Yale 
C&E needed to clear 500 rooms 
for first responders. Then the team 
needed to organize COVID quar­
antine housing. And so on. Yale 
C&E, with a staff of only twen­
ty-two, had to set up a 24/7 office. 
As Vieillard puts it, “No one knew 
the scope of what we would have 
to do.” 

BOXED IN 
“Think about what a student’s 
room might look like when they 
are just leaving for spring break,” 
Vieillard bids me. My suite, I 
remember, had clothes strewn 
about the floor, papers scattered on 
the desks, unmade beds, and toilet­
ries crowding the sink. 

Movers, both those from Meyer 
and those subcontracted to Dorm 
Room Movers, had to figure out 
what belonged to which student—
what went in the box and what 
went in the trash. (Sometimes, 
these decisions of what to send 
and what not to send bordered on 
the absurd. Maayan Schoen ’23 
says she received a rotten potato 
and a half-used bottle of shampoo, 
but almost none of her clothing 
or valuables.) Often, according 
to Vieillard and Meyer’s Ryan 
DeVille (a Business Development 
Associate, who helped coordinate 
the Yale job), students wouldn’t 
respond to movers. Other times, 
movers would discover that stu­
dents had switched rooms with­
out telling Yale. “One suitemate 
moves to Italy for the semester, so 
[another girl] moves into [their] 
room, because it’s nicer,” Vieillard 
conjures as an example. 

After deciding what belonged 
to whom and what went in the 
box and what didn’t, Meyer and 
Dorm Room Movers had to either 
store the items in local Connecti­
cut warehouses or ship them back 
to students, both domestically and 
internationally. 

The 
shipping 
process 
often 
involved lots of “red tape,” DeV­
ille recalls. Meyer employees found 
themselves having to navigate the 
customs laws of countries around 
the world. When I ask about the 
most challenging delivery, DeVille 
pauses, before starting to read off a 
Korean mailing address. He gives 
up halfway through and starts to 
spell out the letters. He laughs, and 
says the hardest part was “commu­
nication.” 

Because of COVID regula­
tions, no one could access dorms 
except the movers. Sometimes, 
Yale C&E employees could visit 
dorm rooms, but for the most part, 
they had to supervise the moving 
remotely. And once the boxes left 
the shipping company and headed 
to Texas or Mississippi or London, 
Yale C&E couldn’t control what 
happened (they did, however, keep 
records, according to Vieillard). 

DeVille estimates that Meyer 
moved over twenty-five thousand 
items and coordinated between 
four-hundred 
and 
six-hundred 
deliveries. Given the scale of the 
operation, as Vieillard puts it, “it 
was inevitable some things would 
get lost and never be found, or 
damaged, 
or 
broken 
beyond 
repair.” Despite their best efforts, 
Yale C&E anticipated that things 
would, naturally, slip through the 
cracks. 

HOW DO YOU LOSE 
A COUCH ?
Katherine Sylvester ’23 doesn’t 
understand how her couch slipped 
through the cracks. It wasn’t a spe­
cial couch, L-shaped and beige, 
but she thought it would be hard 
to lose. She understood how items 
could get lost in the chaos of the 
pandemic. Katherine had expe­
rienced it firsthand when she 
opened the boxes Yale sent home 
to her in spring 2020 and found 
that her framed Dead and Com­
pany poster — a gift from her dad 
— was missing. But like J.D., when 
they lost their items for a second 
time, she had stored the couch 
with Yale through her residential 
college’s summer storage program 
(run in conjunction with Meyer). 
The program, which was cheaper 
and more convenient than getting 
a storage unit, permitted students 
(among other things) to “leave 
one couch per suite” to store over 
the summer of 2021. By then, she 
thought, Yale would have had 
enough time to ensure no item 
went missing. The couch was big, 
and she had labeled it with her full 
name and suite number, as Daven­
port College had specified in their

summer storage directions. She 
was disappointed when it went 
missing, she recalls, but more than 
anything, “determined to find out” 
where it and her other belongings 
(a lamp and a chair) had gone.  

So, she contacted the Davenport 
College office, who then directed 
her to Yale C&E, who re-di­
rected her to the facilities manager 
for Davenport, who re-directed 
her back to Yale C&E, who then 
encouraged her to send a mass 
email to her residential college and 
to email Meyer, who said to ask 
Yale. 

No one knew anything.
“It felt like they were ducking 
responsibility,” Katherine says. “I 
was constantly being directed to 
‘this person’ or ‘this form.’”

When Katherine had exhausted 
all avenues for finding her couch, 
after weeks of emailing back and 
forth, Yale C&E sent her a reim­
bursement 
form, 
which 
Yale 
C&E forwards to students seeking 
repayment after they determine an 
item has been lost. But she never 
got reimbursed. A few days after 
submitting the form, she received 
an email from Yale C&E invoking 
the fine print of the initial sum­
mer storage email Katherine had 
received. “Yale takes no respon­
sibility for any items that are left 
on campus in Spring 2021,” they 
quoted. 

KNOWN UNKNOWNS
When I ask DeVille what Meyer 
does when they can’t determine 
who owns an item, he answers 
matter-of-factly. They rely on 
Yale C&E to help them make that 
identification, he explains, but if 
they can’t find the owner, they put 
it with the “Unknowns.” 

According to DeVille, Meyer 
compiles 
these 
“Unknowns” 
together in one of their storage 
units—from what he describes on 
the phone, it’s a jumble of couches 
and fridges and boxes, full of who-
knows-what. From what I piece 
together from Vieillard and DeV­
ille and my conversations with 
students, there could be Burberry 
scarves, Gucci belts, spare note­
books, game consoles. There could 
be surrealist senior art projects 
and Polaroid photos. Journals and 
game consoles. Childhood stuffed 
animals. 

Soon, Yale and Meyer will 
unbox the items and dispel the 
mystery. They are planning to 
donate all the ‘Unknowns’ to the 
Salvation Army. It’s both an act 
of charity and of simple business. 
Vieillard explains to me that Yale 
has still been paying to store these 
‘unknowns.’ (Though she couldn’t 
give me the exact cost, I got the 
impression that it was expensive.) 

Neither Vieillard nor DeVille 
mentioned any plan to let Yale 
students look at the ‘Unknowns’ 
before they are donated.  

For Christmas, a lucky child 
may get a Burberry scarf, or Stuart 
Weitzman boots. They could even 
get a couch, or—who knows?—
maybe even an organ, according 
to Elko Gerville-Reache ’24, a stu­
dent in Trumbull College. 

“I had an organ—emphasis on 
had,” Elko says. Elko had spent 
years looking for a vintage Ace 
Tone Electronic Organ Model 
Top-2, like the one Ray Manza­
rek of The Doors played. In his 
common room, he set up a music 
studio, replete with amps, pedals, 
guitars, basses, and microphones. 
According to Elko, he knew Yale 
would somehow lose his stuff, so 
he emailed his residential college, 
Yale C&E, and Dorm Room Mov­
ers at the onset of the pandemic: 
“Do not touch my stuff.” 

They touched his stuff. 

They moved it into storage, 
which Elko says he was “initially 
okay with.” After all, Yale C&E 
had to move everything even­
tually to open up rooms for the 
2020-2021 school year. But he was 
nervous about them moving his 
things again, so, as Elko recalls, he 
emailed them again: “Do not touch 
my stuff. Whatever you do, leave 
it there.” They did not leave it in 
storage. 

“[The organ] took three to four 
years to find, and now I was told 
they just threw it out,” he says. 
His words crescendo, but then he 
stalls, as if imagining the red paint 
chipping in a landfill. His voice is 
heavy: “I hope someone took it 
and not—not just threw it out, you 
know?” 

"SATISFIED"
When I ask Dorm Room Mov­
ers if there were any challenges 
to moving such a large volume 
of items, Director of Customer 
Experience Tonya Kinney tells me 
that Dorm Room Movers “doesn’t 
see challenges, just opportunities 
to create a new service.” When 
I ask her what happens when an 
item goes missing, she assures me 
that customers have the “ability 
to purchase a protection plan” but 
that they will “use everything and 
every resource [available] to find 
that item.” If they can’t, she prom­
ises me they try to reimburse the 
client and do “everything in their 
power to ensure the customer is 
satisfied with the outcome.”

PAY BACK TIME 
The first time the (203) ***-
**** number called Katherine—
who is still, to this day, missing 
her couch—she thought it was a 
scammer. The second time, she 
picked up. She was shocked to 
find it was the Yale Police Depart­
ment (YPD), calling her about 
the reimbursement claim she filed 
for the missing couch (and other 
items). At the time, she had yet 
to discover she was ineligible for 
reimbursement. So when she filled 
out the reimbursement form with 
photos and prices for each miss­
ing item, she had thought she was 
done with the process. 

But it had just begun. It can 
take weeks to receive any reim­
bursement, which can hurt stu­
dents who “don't come to campus 
with a lot of resources to fall back 
on,” according to J.D. 

Lieutenant Sabrina Wood of 
YPD tells me that it is standard 
procedure for officers to call stu­
dents who file reimbursement 
claims. They go over students’ 
personal information, information 
about the items, and confirm they 
have taken steps to find their items 
before seeking reimbursement. 
Then, according to Wood, they 
let the student know that, under 
Connecticut Code 53A-157B, it’s 
a “Class A misdemeanor” to file 
a false police report. Wood esti­
mates that the YPD has handled 
75-100 of these cases. 	

Vieillard tells me that, though 
the University has paid out 831 
total claims to students, Yale C&E 
only 
forwards 
reimbursement 
claims above $500 to the YPD. 
“There have been claims of tens 
of thousands of dollars,” Vieillard 
says. When I ask if Yale is con­
cerned about false claims, Vieil­
lard tells me no. Wood, when I 
ask her the same question, tells me 
that “[YPD has] no way to inves­
tigate [false claims].” Yale C&E’s 
policy, according to Vieillard, is 
to take all claims at face value no 
matter how incredible.  “[You get 
students with] five Gucci coats, 
three of those goose down jackets 
[…],” she explains. “It was kind of 
amazing what some students had 
in their rooms.”

“The University put finances 
second,” Jennifer Franssen, Dep­
uty Director of Financial Plan­
ning and Analysis at Yale, tells me. 
Neither Franssen nor Vieillard can 
tell me how much any of this has 
cost—the storage, shipping, and 
reimbursement. When I ask Frans­
sen, she says, “I don’t know.” (Yale 
has a “chart of accounts” system 
which lets employees label any 
budget item and then total them 
accordingly. I ask Franssen if I can 
use this system to add up the num­
bers myself. I am told, quite gen­
tly, “No.”) But Vieillard assures 
me Yale isn't worried about the 
money. “The directive was not to 
be a penny pincher with these stu­
dents,” Vieillard says. “The direc­
tive was to make them whole.” 

The reason they involve the 
YPD at all, Vieillard says, is because 
Yale’s Office of Risk Management 
wants to ensure that there were 
no “patterns of foul play” by mov­
ers, not students. But why, then, 
would the YPD call students and 
not movers? It frightens students, 
and it doesn’t make much sense. 
After all, if Yale C&E were keep­
ing records, as Viellard suggests, 
they would be able to notice and 
notify the YPD of those patterns 
themselves without talking to stu­
dents. But still, Vieillard tells me 
she has “no knowledge” of any 
such patterns of foul play. When 
I contacted Risk Management and 
asked them to explain, they did 
not respond to my requests for 
comment. 

WHILE MY GUITAR 
GENTLY WEEPS
*Asterisk marks a pseudonym
Peter’s* mother waited for four 
hours on Easter to buy him Guitar 
Hero 3, when it came out in 2007. 
His eyes crinkle, as he smiles at the 
memory, before his face sinks, as 
he remembers how the game (and 
all his other games) vanished. 

He and his suitemates wanted 
to make sure all their items had 
been packed up and stored, so 
they asked Yale C&E for a list of 
their things. Yale C&E then con­
tacted Dorm Room Movers on 
their behalf. But instead of a list, 
Dorm Room Movers sent Peter 
pictures of his items. Peter and 
his suitemates could see that some 
of their things weren’t there, but 
they were pleasantly surprised that 
most things seemed to be. 

But when they moved into their 
dorm rooms this August, it was 
clear there were even fewer boxes 
than what Dorm Room Movers 
had promised in the photos. Plus, 
all their games and their game 
consoles (a Wii and an Xbox) 
were missing. 

To Peter, the logic should be 
simple. You open a box, you load 
the box, then someone else opens 
the box. An error, he suggests, 
must have occurred somewhere 
along the way. “I don’t want to 
sound like a conspiracy theorist,” 
he tells me. But when search­
ing for replacements for his rare 
games, which are no longer made, 
he was surprised that a number 
of them on eBay were being sold
