**Title:  How the Classics Department is Rethinking its Curriculum**
**Author: Abbey Kim**
**Page number(s): 7**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
of action items about how to approach a flawed but 
helpful text like Finglass’s. Group members suggested 
adding an annotated bibliography that highlighted 
biases in the text, disclaiming sources, and disclosing 
texts as good for some things and not for others. One 
member referenced Professor Greenwood’s strategy 
of having students come to class with one thing they 
thought the text failed to accomplish or misstated.   
“We want to talk a lot about how the classes in the 
department are structured,” MacDonald explained. 
“To discuss how syllabi are created, what the goals of 
syllabi should be, are faculty doing that, and how can 
we make that better? We've talked a lot about how we 
can make Classics more accessible.”

The group is already seeing movement on this 
front. Graduate student Christopher Londa designed 
his course “Identity, Power, and Practice in Classical 
Studies” with the help of a syllabus workshop by the 
reading group. According to its syllabus, the course 
aims to tackle the “systems of power and legacies of 
oppression” often brushed aside in the study of Clas­
sics. 

After the meeting ended, I took the elevator down 
to leave Phelps Hall. It was only as I left that I noticed 
the bright blue posters hanging in the elevator and 
entryway, their bold white font advertising the group. 
I was tempted to grab one to bring with me, as a kind 
of memento, but I decided to leave it be. I had faith 
that this would not be the last time I saw the group’s 
name.

ASIDE
A  THANK  YOU NOTE
BY LAURA GLESBY
Keith was sitting on his Adeline Street porch when 
Annie and I approached him one sunny Saturday in 
October of 2017. His nephew, who seemed about 
five, introduced himself to us in one breath as Jaco­
by-Flash-Batman-Superman. The little boy zoomed 
around his front yard, pretending to be a medley of 
the heroes in his self-assigned name. Flimsy leaves 
crinkling beneath us, we asked Keith about a house 
at the end of the block: a sleek, angular duplex that 
seemed out of place in a neighborhood of older, 
vinyl-sided homes. Annie, the New Journal editor 
accompanying me on this reporting adventure, 
wore statement earrings and spoke fluent Span­
ish and rapped the first knock on each front door 
we approached. I was a soft-spoken first year, shy 
about asking strangers personal questions and fairly 
convinced that our escapade would lead to a fateful 
encounter with a serial killer. Our probable untimely 
deaths aside, I was certain that this would be both 
my first and last reported story. Journalism, after all, 
wasn’t for the gentle. Later that night, I wrote up a 
scene on my bottom-bunk dorm bed and realized 
all I had noticed that afternoon in my awkward qui­
etness. I revisited the stream of suggestions that the 
New Journal editors had left on my draft and finally 
saw their unwritten message: You can learn how to 
do this. Poring through my notes, I found my last 
line: with time, Keith had posited, the new building 
sticking out from all the others could start to seem 
like a “regular old house.”
