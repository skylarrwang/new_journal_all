n October 2021, the Atlantic 
ran a piece about Alden Glob­
al Capital’s ransacking of the 
American press. A pioneer in what 
has been called vulture capital­
ism, the Manhattan-based hedge 
fund had purchased the owning 
company of the Chicago Tribune in 
May of 2021. At the time of sale, 
Alden already owned roughly two 
hundred newspapers, many of 
them small-town publications that 
the fund proceeded to ruthlessly 
gut. With its recent purchase, Al­
den added to its spoils the Chicago 
Tribune, the Los Angeles Times, 
the New York Daily News, and six 
other publications. Two days after 
the sale, the staff of the Tribune, a 
quarter of whom wereas immedi­
ately laid off, was put to work in an 
obscure corner of the city. “Here 
was one of America’s most storied 
newspapers—a publication that had 
endorsed Abraham Lincoln and 
scooped the Treaty of Versailles, 
that had toppled political bosses 
and tangled with crooked mayors 
and collected dozens of Pulitzer 
Prizes—reduced to a newsroom the 
size of a Chipotle,” reporter McKay 
Coppins wrote.

Alden’s buyout of the Tribune 
was just one crisis in the long con­
flict between capital and journa­
lism. New Haven provides an illu­
minating case study. Included in 
Alden’s deal for the Tribune was a 
much smaller paper, New Haven’s 
very own Advocate—or at least a 
mutilated remnant of it. Founded 
in 1975 in an attempt to break out 
of the confines of the corporate 
newsroom, the New Haven Advo­
cate went through a long series 
of buyouts until it was dissolved 
into CTNow, a weekly aggregator 
of arts and culture events in the 
state. When Alden purchased the 
Tribune Company, the relatively 
obscure CTNow was part of the 
deal.

How did the Advocate, a paper 
inspired by the anti-capitalist lea­
flets that nineteen-sixties stoners 
stapled together, end up absorbed 
by the conglomerate-behemoth 
Alden? The basic timeline is sim­
ple enough. In 1999, Advocate 
founder Geoffrey Robinson sold 
the paper to the Hartford Courant. 
The following year, the Courant’s 
parent company, Times-Mirror, 
was purchased by the Tribune 
Company for eight billion dollars. 
In May of 2021, Alden bought the 
Tribune company. Somewhere in 
the debris lay the disfigured corpse 
of the Advocate. Born in protest 
of to the atrocities of American 
capitalism and the lies spun by the 
mainstream media, the rebellious 
spirit of the Advocate would have 
to find a new home.

On an unseasonably warm day 
in late November, I walked east 
past the northern edge of the New 
Haven Green to learn more about 
the history of the Advocate. After­
noon threatened to turn into eve­
ning, and the setting sun caught 
the season’s last orange, yellow, 
and red leaves. Initially, I struggled 
to find the building I was looking 
for—51 Chapel Street, the current 
home of the New Haven Indepen­
dent, a locally-rooted non-profit 
newspaper that publishes exclusi­
vely online. Finally, I spotted 51 
in bronze lettering. The entryway 
sat between a high-end hat shop 
and Ferucci’s, an independent 
dress clothing es store. The block 
looked like it was frozen in the 
nineteen-fifties; as I crossed the 
street, I wondered if I might run 
into a twenty-year old Leonard 
Cohen. 

Up three flights of stairs, I 
found someone who came close 
enough: the Independent’s editor 
and founder, Paul Bass. Wearing 
a yellow t-shirt, a colorful yar­
mulke, and blue jeans that might 
generously be called fatherly, Bass 
carries himself with a humility 
that obscures his importance in 
New Haven’s journalistic lands­
cape. As I sat in his office and 
snacked on cannolis, Bass trea­
ted me to an hour-long history 
of New Haven journalism. He 
walked me through how a belo­
ved, city paper, anti-establishment 
to its core, inspired by anti-capita­
list leaflets of the nineteen-sixties 
was ultimately purchased by the 
vampires at Alden.

Exposure to the brutalities of Sou­
thern racism, the escalating war 
in Vietnam, and, most of all, the 
mandatory draft, fueled for youth 
of that generation a rage at esta­
blishment 
institutions—schools, 
government, 
newspapers—that 
no mainstream publication could 
temper. The underground press 
was given its name for its promo­
tion of drug use and legalization, 
but it was equally marked by a 
rebellion against the lies of Ame­
rican capitalism and their dissemi­
nation in major U.S. newspapers.

To better understand the coun­
ter-cultural presses of the nine­
teen-sixties and seventies, I spoke 
with Jim Sleeper, a retired profes­
sor of political science at Yale (and 
a former writer at the New Journal) 
who worked as a journalist in the 
nineteen-seventies. His baritone 
voice carried smoothly over the 
phone. He had a confidence and 
meter to his speech that reminded 
me of my grandfather, but instead 
of telling me stories about the les­
sons he learned in business school 
or his memory of 
‘We couldn’t help but 
make money’

Before Bass became the edi­
tor of the Independent, he wrote 
for and edited the Advocate. The 
paper was born as an alternative 
to the straight-laced newsroom 
of the Hartford Courant. However, 
the Advocate had its roots in what 
is now called the underground 
press 
of 
the 
nineteen-sixties.

the founding of the state of Israel, 
Sleeper’s stories centered around 
his time in the nineteen-seventies 
counterculture.

Sleeper recalled his time as a 
graduate student at Harvard in 
the mid nineteen-seventies, when 
he would line up on Wednesday 
nights to pick up each week’s 
issue of the Village Voice, a paper 
born out of the same frustration 
with the mainstream press that 
helped birth the Advocate. By the 
nineteen-seventies, the rebellious 
spirit of the previous decade had 
partially dissipated, but an appe­
tite for news sources that rejec­
ted the inanities of the corporate 
press remained. The papers born 
from this nineteen-seventies tran­
sition period—the most famous of 
which was the Village Voice—are 
now referred to as “the alternative 
press.” These alternative weeklies 
retained much of the rebellious 
spirit of the previous decade but 
were run like small businesses. 
The Boston Phoenix, which Slee­
per wrote for, was one of these 
alternative weeklies. The Advo­
cate, for its part, was founded in 
1975 by two copy-editors at the 
Hartford Courant who, in Bass’ 
telling, were bored by the articles 
their paper was publishing. 
“The hippies and druggies 
were 
coming 
above 
ground 
in their lives,” Bass told me. 
“They’re buying homes, making 
a little more money. And I think 
the new alternative press reflec­
ted that. They were still anti-mi­
litary, they were still critical of 
establishment, 
especia­
lly the media, and they were 
very pro-drugs, but they were 
more above ground and they 
made their money from res­
taurant ads and sex ads. Espe­
cially sex ads.”. (In a eulogy 
for the Advocate Bass wrote 
in 2013, he quotes a friend 
asking him, “Don’t you feel 
like you’re wrapping the 
Talmud around a copy of 
Hustler?”)

I asked Bass how publi­
cations like the Advocate 
managed to retain their 
spirit of rebellion and 
independence while mee­
ting deadlines and gene­
rating enough income to 
stay afloat. Bass assured 
me there was never a pro­

blem—the alternative papers were 
beloved, and the mainstream press 
was loathed. “Even if the people 
running these papers were sto­
ned out of their mind, forgetting 
to pay the electricity bill, they 
couldn’t help but make money,” 
Bass said. 

One of the hallmark featu­
res of the independent press of 
those years was the writing style 
known now as “New Journalism.” 
In the underground and alterna­
tive press, commitment to objec­
tivity—a staple of the mainstream 
press—was seen as nothing but the 
mainstream media’s veneer for the 
corporate agenda that their papers 
pushed. “Capitalism is good, cor­
porate profits are good for the 
economy,” Bass told me, mimic­
king the one belief that mains­
tream journalism was not suppo­
sed to question.

New Journalism embraced a 
different philosophy. “You brou­
ght tools of fiction to how you 
write,” Bass said. “You develop 
character, you always make a 
point, and you don’t pretend to be 
objective.”

To Bass, the Advocate’s great 
popularity stemmed from the 
paper’s willingness to challenge 
the established norms of the 
day—drug culture was promoted, 
slumlords were exposed, private 
property was questioned. That, 
To Bass, the Advocate’s great popularity 
stemmed from the paper’s willingness to chal­
lenge the established norms of the day—drug 
culture was promoted, slumlords were exposed, 
private property was questioned. That, and 
they knew where the best restaurants were.
