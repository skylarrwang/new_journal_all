activist, and elder on the land now 
referred to as New Haven—though 
New Haven, including Wooster 
Square, is the unceded territory 
of the Quinnipiac people. Clement­
had been protesting for the 
removal of the statue for a decade, 
so he showed up when he heard 
the statue was to be removed that 
day. There, in the middle of the 
first wave of COVID-19, he said 
an Italian-American counter-pro­
tester spat in Clement’s face. 
Clement 
describes 
his 
fight 
against the Columbus statue as a 
no-brainer: “The Columbus statue 
is representative of the beginning 
of colonialism—why wouldn’t we 
fight against that?...If you want 
to honor Italian Americans, then 
choose somebody else, somebody 
who represents you. Not a mass 
murderer and rapist.” And New 
Haven’s statue carries added sym­
bolism because the Knights of 
Columbus’s homebase is in New 
Haven—“that’s the organization 
that fought for and put up these 
statues across the country,” said 
Clement, and it’s also where the 
statue will soon reside.


Even though Clement and other 
advocates have fought against cel­
ebrations of Columbus for years, 
Elicker acknowledged only the 
recent initiative of “many leaders 
in the Italian Community” when 
the statue was removed. But this 
is unsurprising: at a recent Board 
of Alders meeting, Clement told 
me, only Italian-Americans were 
invited to express their perspec­
tive on Columbus’ legacy in New 
Haven. 

“The way the city has looked 
at it, the Italian Americans are a 
big voting bloc,” said Clement. 
“There's only a few of us Indige­
nous people here. And why is that? 
Because of Columbus.”


On the subject of the IAWGNH 
and the city officials in Bridgeport 
who voted to put back their statue, 
Clement said, “White supremacists 
are going kicking and screaming 
into the night. They don't want 
to give up any power. They're 
not going to give up any power 
without a fight, and then they'll 
manipulate and do whatever they 
can to regain that power.”


Columbus’s statue has generated 
more than a fight: it’s become a dis­
traction. For James Rawlings, the 
former President of the NAACP 
branch of New Haven, Chairman 
of the Connecticut Native Ameri­
can Intertribal Council, and tribal 
elder of the Wampanoag tribe, the 
persistence of debate over these 
monuments detracts from more 
present, 
consequential 
social, 
economic, and health inequities, 
especially during the COVID-19 
pandemic. He points to Secretary 
of the Interior Deb Haaland, the 
first Native American to serve in 
the Cabinet, whom he says is cre­
ating long-overdue change, espe­
cially in returning stolen land to 
Indigenous peoples. 


When the statue was removed 
from Wooster Square, Clement 
gathered Indigenous people from 
the area and reblessed the ground 
where the Columbus statue had 
stood. He doesn’t want to have 
to do it again, nor does he want 
to have to fight for the statue’s 
removal once more. But, he said, 
he would.

“It is tiring,” said Clement, 
followed by a long pause. “This 
government has been trying to 
erase us for 500 years. They hav­
en't done it yet, and they're never 
gonna do it. Our communities are 
under attack all the time...We still 
have to go through that every day. 
It's sad. When is it going to end?”

“Indicando la via al futuro,” or 
“Pointing the Way to the Future,” 
is the title of the monument that 
was chosen among artist sub­
missions for a statue to replace 
Columbus. Created by Marc-An­

thony Massaro, it depicts an Ital­
ian family, with a man at its helm 
and his son pointing to the hori­
zon—while two women of the 
family watch. It was chosen by the 
Wooster Square Monument Com­
mittee, which included Calzetta. 
Elicker assembled the group fol­
lowing the removal of Columbus 
to seek out a statue that would bet­
ter represent the Italian American 
experience. 


Calzetta hates it. “It’s disgust­
ing,” she said. “That is not the 
Italian American immigrant. ... It 
shows their lack of knowledge of 
the Italian culture, of the Italian 
immigrant experience, no knowl­
edge of art.” 


Calzetta says the statue depicts 
the two women as “very weak,” 
which she finds not only demean­
ing but also historically inaccu­
rate. The Columbus statue was not 
explicitly about women, according 
to Calzetta, so she found it more 
representative (though, unsurpris­
ingly, Columbus was not kind 
to women—for one, he regularly 
“gifted” Taíno women to his crew­
men to be beaten and raped). 


Other Italian Americans are 
dissatisfied with the statue. Vin­
cent Mauro Jr. is the chairman 
of the Democratic Party in New 
Haven, a former alder of Ward 8, 
which includes Wooster Square, 
and a 48-year-old second-gen­
eration Italian American. If he 
had it his way, Mauro wouldn’t 
pick Columbus to represent Ital­
ian-Americans—instead, he’d pick 
the kitchen table as a symbol for 
family and exchanging ideas and 
culture. 


Clement wishes he had been 
included 
in 
the 
discussions.“I 
would have liked if Indigenous 
people were invited to the table 
to decide what was going to go 
there,” he said. “[Mayor Elicker] 
decided that he was going to leave 
it up to the Italian American com­
munity.”


Rawlings 
proposes 
a 
more 
prominent location for a monu­
ment that honors Indigenous his­
tories—perhaps near City Hall. 


To put it bluntly, New Haven’s 
solution disappoints many people: 
the new monument’s symbolism is 
too much, not enough, and com­
pletely wrong, all at once. Perhaps 
the form of the monument itself is 
underestimated, or overlooked, as 
a limiting factor in this debate over 
public memory. Perhaps if we can 
think beyond the monument, we 
can reach a real solution. 


In addition to teaching, Profes­
sor Thomas Allen Harris makes 
films. His work explores the his­
torical narratives within families 
in relation to larger cultural shifts. 
One of his projects—first founded 
through the Digital Diaspora Fam­
ily Reunion, LLC, and then turned 
into the PBS series Family Pictures 
USA—focuses on inherited and 
collated family photo albums, and 
the relationship between personal 
family narratives and collective 
ones. Harris tours the country, 
summoning families from diverse 
backgrounds to slip on gloves and 
dive into photo archives of their 
ancestry. After interviewing about 
one hundred families, Harris com­
bined the narratives into an exhibit 
he calls a “shared family album.” 
His work proposes a new mode of 
documentation, historical think­
ing, and public memory.

“The family album is in some 
ways a kind of monument,” said 
Harris. “It's not really a monu­
ment, but it has in it this solution to 
understanding the complexity, the 
fullness and the diversity of who 
we are and who we've been. For 
me, it's really about moving the 
family album into the public space 
in a way that approximates or tries 
to engage in the space that monu­
ments would typically occupy.”


Harris’s interviews, especially 
those with families who have con­
nections to the Confederacy, often 
confront topics similar to those 
broached when discussing colonial 
monuments.

“I have people who come to me 
with pictures of Confederate fam­
ily members and history in their 
albums,” said Harris. “I create a 
space where they can come and 
share those [...] They don't have to 
have shame around that. That's part 
of the history. They could look at 
it squarely, and we can have honest 
conversations around the ambiva­
lence people might have.”


Monuments are predisposed to 
promoting a genre of historical 
thinking that parallels IAWGNH’s 
approach to Columbus: a singu­
lar, mythologized narrative that 
obscures history. To change this 
pattern, federal guidance might 
be necessary—instead of leaving it 
all up to city government to make 
(or reverse) monument decisions, 
which tend to prioritize wealthy 
and white groups’ concerns. But 
the monument problem will not be 
solved by just changing the figures 
and ideas that monuments repre­

sent, nor  by adding plaques that 
gestures at historical, political, and 
social context. It’s about moving 
on from monuments altogether, 
toward other vessels that engage in 
other ways with their public, the 
present, and the truth. 


On June 24, 2020, once the 
Columbus statue was lifted from 
its granite base in Wooster Square, 
it was moved to the road and onto 
the open platform of a truck. It 
was an unfamiliar sight: Colum­
bus, embarrassingly, was smoth­
ered by ropes. Then the truck 
started to move, and all of the sud­
den, the monument was replaced 
by momentum; the symbolism 
transformed, at least momentarily, 
into performance art. Here was 
nuanced symbolism, embedded in 
its form an obvious context about 
both the statue’s present and past, 
and the product of a public re-en­
gaging with history. If a public 
representation of Columbus were 
to ever seem appropriate, then per­
haps this was it—for it was de-cen­
tered, defamed, and, most of all, 
fleeting. People cheered along the 
sides of the road when the statue 
came to them, and when it rolled 
away, they looked away.
