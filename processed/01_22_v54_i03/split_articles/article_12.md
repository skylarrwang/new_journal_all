all this and more litter the floor of 
Jayne’s studio. You have to watch 
where you step. One Thursday 
morning in October, Jayne her­
self nearly kicked a sheet of glass. 
“Always a million things lying on 
the floor that don't belong there,” 
she said theatrically, like it was 
someone else’s fault.

Jayne wore black that day: black 
socks, black capris, a black T-shirt. 
But there were flashes of color—
on her shirt, three cartoon fish: 
orange, red, blue. On her gray 
sneakers, threads of orange around 
the ankles and at the tips of the 
tongues. Her short hair is golden 
blond, dusted lightly with silver. 
Her eyes are blue, and the thick 
plastic frames of her bifocals are 
sunflower yellow.

She was fixing a Handel lamp­
shade. It was around a hundred 
years old and would likely sell at 
auction for a couple thousand dol­
lars. A mosaic of cattails and water 
lilies circled the base; above them 
was a layer of blue pieces streaked 
with white, then a ring of orange. 
Each piece was lined with cop­
per foil and soldered in place. A 
few of the pieces had cracked, 
so Jayne had glued them back 
together. Jayne doesn’t waste old 
glass. It often achieves rare colors 
that can’t be matched today, partly 
because glassmakers back then 
added ingredients like uranium 
and arsenic. (In the early nine­
teen-hundreds, some glass could 
be close to 25 percent uranium.) 
Holding a coil of bright silver sol­
der against a soldering iron until it 
liquified, Jayne touched up a gap 
between two pieces of glass. The 
solder sank in and smoked. The air 
smelled bitter. 

Lead is the main ingredient 
in both solder and came. I once 
asked Jayne if that was dangerous. 
“Oh, yeah. Yes. There’s lead poi­
soning,” she said, and laughed: a 
bouncing chuckle that died down 
gradually. The CDC says an ele­
vated lead level is anything over 
five micrograms of lead per decili­
ter of your blood. Jayne has twen­
ty-five. (Later, she pointed out that 
this likely wasn’t all from stained 
glass; some of it could have come 
from growing up around lead 
paint in the nineteen-forties and 
fifties.) She doesn’t feel any symp­
toms, but her work takes its toll in 
other ways. In November 2019, 
Jayne was climbing on a stool, try­
ing to reach something on a shelf. 
Somehow, she shifted her weight 
wrong and the stool flipped over. 
She landed hard. It took a year and 
a half for her back to heal.

THE  NEW  JOURNAL
Jayne has been making stained 
glass since either 1973 or 1974, 
she can’t remember which. Either 
way, it’s getting close to fifty years. 
She’s one of only a handful of 
independent stained-glass artists in 
Connecticut actively restoring old 
church windows—Jayne estimates 
there are three or four others along 
the coastline, maybe a few more 
upstate. All of them are getting on 
in years. Some are shutting down 
their studios, too old to carry on. 
When Jayne starts working from 
home next year, she’ll join their 
ranks.

Jayne believes that the com­
ing years could be grim for the 
stained-glass scene. Without stu­
dios like hers, the only places that 
would restore church windows 
would be big out-of-state glass 
firms that charge huge fees. Small 
Connecticut churches wouldn’t 
be able to raise the necessary cash, 
and so their windows—old, beau­
tiful windows—would deteriorate. 
Some glass, perhaps, would crack. 
The paint might chip and flake. 
The cames might stretch and cor­
rode, or the window frame might 
warp, weakening the entire struc­
ture, until at last the glass falls to 
the ground and shatters.

There’s a joke on Twitter about 
traveling back in time and giving 
a medieval peasant a Dorito. The 
punchline is they’d die. But if a 
nacho-flavored chip could have 
killed someone back then with 
overstimulation, I don’t know how 
anyone survived Chartres Cathe­
dral. Inside are 176 windows, over 
twenty-seven thousand square feet 
of stained glass. Light pours from 
every wall, pooling in vivid scar­
let and sapphire on the stone floor. 
Three massive “rose windows” 
blossom in concentric circles, 
depicting the Last Judgement, the 
Virgin and Child, dozens of Bibli­
cal scenes. The smallest rose win­
dow is thirty feet across. It must 
have been like looking straight 
into God’s iris. 

All 176 windows were installed 
between 1203 and 1240. Since then 
it’s all been downhill, many experts 
think. During the Renaissance, the 
big-shot artists picked up paint­
ing instead of stained glass. Then 
the Protestants arrived and began 
building their supremely boring 
churches. Stained glass’s decline 
was complete: walls of divine light 
had fallen decisively out of fashion.

Skip to the eighteen hundreds. 
The British Arts and Crafts move­
ment, in search of a style untainted 
by capitalism, decided Gothic 
architecture (and stained glass with 
it) fit the bill. Across the Atlan­
tic, American artists mimicked 
the crafts but dropped the social­
ist undertones, sparking a stained-
glass renaissance. Louis Comfort 
Tiffany’s Art Nouveau lamps and 
windows led the way—he’s still the 
one name you’d know if you knew 
any American stained-glass.

During 
the 
nineteen-sixties, 
stained glass lost sight of God. 
Here’s how the website for the 
Stained Glass Association of Amer­
ica portentously describes the 
period:

The statement “God is dead” was 
heard. It was time for stained glass 
to find a home in the secular world 
again. After the pessimistic “beat­
niks” came the optimistic “hip­
pies” spreading eastward from San 
Francisco where they were rehabbing 
the old houses, painting them bright 
colors and, of course, repairing the 
stained glass.

Jayne was born a couple decades 
earlier, on the Fourth of July, 1946. 
As a kid in North Haven, she had 
no interest in art but lots in sci­
ence. Her favorite toy was an A.C. 
Gilbert chemistry set. She’d mix 
vials full of chemicals, heat them 
over candles, and watch them bub­
ble over. Gilbert chemistry sets, 
long since banned, included plenty 
of harmless chemicals along with 
some plenty harmful ones, like 
potassium nitrate and sodium cya­
nide. The company even made a 
short-lived “Atomic Energy Lab,” 
which came with, yes, uranium.

Jayne attended St. Mary’s High 
School in New Haven, a Catho­
lic school. “That was probably the 
demise of my religion,” she told 
me. (About ten years ago, though, 
she returned to repair the con­
vent’s windows. “I came back to 
haunt them,” she said.)

She studied chemistry for a cou­
ple years of college, then put her 
academics on pause. After a mar­
riage and a kid and a move to New 
York and a divorce, Jayne ended 
up working at the West Haven 
branch of Miles Laboratories, a 
pharmaceutical company in the 
complex that’s since become Yale’s 
West Campus. She didn’t like it 
much, so after a couple years, she 
moved to Colorado. There, she 
met people who were part of a 
growing American crafts move­
ment. (These were presumably the 
“hippies” who had killed God.) She 
played around with pottery, with 
macramé, with “all different kinds 
of crafts,” she said. Soon after, she 
moved back to Connecticut and 
tried stained glass for the first time. 
She fell irrationally, irrevocably 
in love. She speaks of the decision 
as if it had not been a decision at 
all, but an event beyond her con­
trol. She told me once that the glass 
itself had said to her, “This is what 
you’re going to do.” 

She fell irrationally,

decline. “All these things are fall­
ing away,” she told me. “We live 
in a throwaway society.” 

She blames it mostly on IKEA: 
mass-automation makes it cheaper 
to buy new things, she says, than to 
fix old ones. But stained glass can’t 
yet be automated very efficiently, 
and the restoration of old win­
dows is the opposite of throwaway 
culture. The real problem, Jayne 
believes, is that not enough young 
people want to devote themselves 
to the craft—the work is just too 
hard.

⬘
One morning at the end of 
October, I arrived at Jayne’s studio 
with a piece of paper stuffed in my 
pocket. The drawing on it looked 
like this:

Jayne chose a deep blue glass for 
the outer corners and something 
called “glue chip” glass for the cen­
tral piece. Glue chip glass is made 
by sandblasting a sheet of clear 
glass, then coating it with ani­
mal-hide glue. As the glue dries, it 
“pings off,” Jayne said, taking little 
chips of glass with it and leaving 
a frosty, fern-like pattern. I told 
Jayne I’d be happy to pay her for 
the materials. She just laughed at 
me. “Oh, please,” she said.

Jayne cut along the lines of my 
drawing and traced the corner 
pieces onto the blue glass with a 
Sharpie. Then she placed the glass 
cutter—a tiny wheel of carbide fas­
tened to a plastic handle—against a 
straightedge and dragged it toward 
her along one of the Sharpie lines. 
It made a sound like quickly ripped 
cardstock and left a slender score. 
Jayne snapped the glass with her 
hands; it broke cleanly. Next she 
made a curved score, freehand. She 
squeezed a pair of running pliers—
which have a mouth shaped like a 
frown—on the score, and the glass 
snapped along the curve. Piece 
number one was finished. 

I copied Jayne, dragging the 
glass cutter, squeezing the running 
pliers. It was like snapping a sheet 
of caramel. The edges of the glass 
left my fingers with an odd rough­
ness, and I wondered if it was the 
feeling of tiny shards in my skin. 
“You’re all set,” Jayne said, and 
walked away. 

I didn’t feel quite set. I tried my 
first curved score, but, pressing 
too hard and moving too fast, I 
slipped wide of my intended line. 
Jayne came back and excised a del­
icately thin slice to make my piece 
its proper size. She moved more 
slowly than I had and held the cut­
ter more gently.

When Jayne first started, there 
were 
no 
stained-glass 
teach­
ers in the area, she said. So she 
taught herself, a mystifying feat 
in a highly technical craft. Even 
she can’t explain how she learned 
everything—how to solder, how 
to cut glass, what kind of pliers 
to buy. Sometimes she visited a 
stained-glass store called Whitte­
more-Durgin, where she might 
have been told what supplies she 
needed. But the rest of it was luck 
and trial and error and youthful 
determination. 

She 
rummaged 
through dumpsters to find scraps 
of glass. Her first ever piece was a 
purple and blue glass jewelry box. 
At the time, the switch from 
chemistry to glass felt like a hard 
pivot. But the more deeply she 
fell in love with glass, the more 
she began to see the connection. 
“The chemical makeup of glass is 
so unusual,” she said. “It’s the only 
thing you can transform, shape, 
make it molten, make it solid, blow 
it into a ball, and then take that ball 
and flatten it out again.” 

In the nearly fifty years since she 
opened her first studio, Jayne has 
burned through ten studios (one 
of them did literally burn down), 
all in Branford. Now, she believes 
stained glass and other skilled 
trades—masons, cobblers, book­
binders, furniture-makers—are in 
Jayne was going to help me 
make it into stained glass. She 
wore a plain black sweatshirt over 
a red turtleneck. On her wrists and 
around her neck, the red peeked 
out from behind the black. Fran­
cis, the apprentice, was working at 
a nearby table and whistling.

windows.
