A MORNING EGG 
IN THE TRUMBULL 
DINING HALL
BY PHOEBE LIU
Knock, knock. A crack. Tap. More cracks. Peel—an 
attempt, at least. I press the egg onto the table. The trans­
lucent white bounces back, just enough to let me know 
it’s there. I pick up a knife and cut into the egg, watching 
the deep yellow seep out. It’s inevitable. Kind of like my 
day. I’m wearing my hoodie with the hood all the way 
up so that it covers most of my face, and I’m letting my 
polka-dot pajama pants sag just enough to be embar­
rassing. As if no one can see me cutting open an egg in 
the dining hall every morning during the 9 a.m. lecture 
I never attend. I don’t want to think about it. So I salt, 
pepper, and swallow. When I leave, there are always five 
or so small shards of shell stuck to the table, to a napkin, or 
to the bottom of my shoe. I leave, walking on eggshells.

time, if possible. 

In my conversation with Paul 
Bass, the editor was insistent that 
no tension exists between a maga­
zine’s profitability and its ability to 
generate thought-provoking con­
tent. Readers seek content that is 
stimulating and fresh, and adverti­
sers shell out the most for publica­
tions that readers love. Typically, 
decay at a newspaper results not 
from profitability itself but from 
the paper-pushers, HR consul­
tants, and money-grubbers that 
get hired later. 

In the rise and fall of publi­
cations, there is something of a 
life-cycle. Stories about the pre­
datory behavior of a company like 
Alden are undeniably troubling. 
Journalists at publications like the 
Tribune and the Advocate had life-
long careers overturned by a han­
dful of nihilistic venture capita­
lists. At the same time, the tedium 
of corporate media is precisely 
what has pushed writers and rea­
ders to seek out new platforms and 
styles of communication, both in 
the nineteen-seventies as well as 
today. While Alden chews on the 
charred remains of the publica­
tions it buys, the boring papers it 
will publish will give even greater 
incentive for writers to break new 
boundariess and attract readers in 
yet more powerful ways.
