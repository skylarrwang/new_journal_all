I
t was nine on a November 
morning, the sun low in the east, 
and eleven stained-glass win­
dows in the west end of the nave 
glowed strangely from the indirect 
light. The glass was mostly opal­
escent sky blue, but it danced as I 
watched: ripples of orange, yellow, 
and green burst from nowhere, 
then faded away. In one window, 
four pieces of red glass formed the 
Greek letter alpha. In another shone 
a red omega.

artist and an expert in restoration. 
Later this morning, the windows 
would be extracted from the walls; 
then Jayne would drive them to 
her studio in nearby Branford, take 
them completely apart, and, over 
the next two months, restore them.

Jayne is 75 years old, about five 
feet tall, and not as strong as she 
used to be. She can’t lift large win­
dows herself anymore. In Feb­
ruary, she plans to go into par­
tial retirement and give up major 
restoration jobs like this one for 
good. It’ll be nice. She’ll leave her 
Branford studio. She’ll work from 
home. She’ll focus on her own art, 
and she won’t have to deal with the 
physical strain of repairing heavy 
windows. These six in the Stony 
Creek nave will be the last of her 
career.

But right now, there was a 
problem. Whoever had previously 
installed the windows had soldered 
them directly to the metal bars in 
the opening of the wall—according 
to Jayne, they should have twisted 
wires around those bars instead. 
“I don’t know what idiot ever did 
that,” she said. 

She tried to grind through the 
solder with a Dremel, to no avail. 
Then her apprentice, Francis, fig­
ured out you could cut the solder 
with wire cutters. He walked from 
window to window, snipping 
them loose. Francis will take over 
Jayne’s studio when she leaves, and 
in the meantime, she’s teaching 
him the craft of restoration. Fran­
cis likes to call himself “grasshop­
per” and Jayne “master.” He’s in his 
late sixties and wears his gray hair 
in a short ponytail.

Eventually, two guys wearing 
cargo pants and hoodies showed 
up. Outside, one of them climbed 
a ladder and began to scrape the 
putty around a window with his 
box cutter. Chunks of the stuff 
came showering down. Jayne, 
who had been inside labeling the 
windows with duct-tape Roman 
numerals, walked onto the lawn to 
watch.

More scraping. More shower­
ing. The second worker pushed 
from inside. Finally, the window 
emerged. The man on the ladder 
hoisted it with both hands, found 
his balance, and began to climb 
slowly down. The ladder shud­
dered with each step. He reached 
the grass and handed the window 
to Francis, who received it rev­
erently. It was too fragile to hold 
flat, so Francis carried it straight 
up in front of him, as if looking 
in a mirror. Beside the open trunk 
of her white Volvo, Jayne silently 
watched him approach. Francis 
rested the left edge of the window 
on the floor of the trunk and slowly 
lowered the right. We exhaled: the 
first of six was safe.

Jayne Crowley was here at Stony 
Creek Congregational Church to 
oversee the removal of the alpha 
window, the omega window, and 
four others. The windows were 
over a hundred years old, and 
their cames—strips of lead that join 
each piece of glass together—had 
warped and crumbled. A few pieces 
of glass had cracked. The windows 
needed a facelift, and Jayne was 
the plastic surgeon: a stained-glass 

The windows needed a 
facelift, and Jayne was 
the plastic surgeon: a 
stained-glass artist and

In February, Jayne Crowley will 
partially retire from her stained-glass 
business.
