I
f I was ever uncertain of 
whether other white grand­
mas dressed like mine, the 
breakfast meeting of the Italian 
American Women of Greater 
New Haven (IAWGNH) made the 
answer obvious. Her uniform was 
everywhere, without an infraction 
in sight: tan leather velcro-strap 
shoes or white sneakers, white 
shirts underneath buttoned cardi­
gans or fleecy vests, the occasional 
whiff of Chanel noº5 in between 
overwhelming waves of Chanel 
noº5, pearls and bulbous neck­
laces, little swooshing curls in 
hair just a few inches long, and so 
many scarves. Was this what my 
grandma’s mysterious bridge club 
looked like, all those years of my 
childhood?

“This is my pleasant leisure time 
activity,” said Frances Calzetta, 
the President of the IAWGNH. 
With a little smile, she gestured 
past a jumble of Thanksgiving 
and Christmas decorations, to the 
group’s members seated around 
square tables in a corner of the 
Twin Pines diner in East Haven.

Despite the festive ambience, 
Calzetta asserted that this was a 
“business meeting.” Or, she cor­
rected herself, it usually doubled as 
a breakfast and a business meeting. 
Usually, they’d discuss business 
first (fundraisers, candidates for 
their scholarship, other miscella­
neous items) and then chow down. 
But this time, it was a mess: the 
restaurant had booked two funer­
als—most likely either Greeks or 
Italians, she said—in the back room 
where Calzetta and 
her colleagues had planned to con­
duct their business. With agenda 
items thwarted, their breakfast was 
reduced to, well, just breakfast. 

It turns out the IAWGNH is 
nothing like a bridge club. Their 
“pleasant leisure time activity” is 
not cards—it’s a lawsuit against 
the city of New Haven. The 
group filed their suit in October, 
in response to the removal of the 
Columbus statue from Wooster 
Square Park in July of 2020. 

The removal resulted from pro­
tests against the statue during the 
movement for racial justice in 
June 2020 ignited by the death of 
George Floyd; over the course of 
the year, nearly a hundred other 
statues were removed across the 
country.

If Calzetta and her colleagues 
are fighting on the side of white 
backlash in the war over Ameri­
can history, their battle may seem 
obscure: a small group of mostly 
elderly Italian American Women 
of Greater New Haven, with funds 
raised from a fashion show (par­
tially collected in what appeared to 
be a Barnes and Noble paper bag), 
via discussions at eggs-and-bacon 
breakfasts at a local diner, have 
taken it upon themselves to com­
pel the city to put back a statue in 
a tiny park in New Haven. 

Columbus, of course, is not 
obscure; he has been aggrandized 
to the point of ubiquity. And the 
group’s actions aren’t surprising: 
they fit a national pattern of Italian 
Americans going to impassioned 
lengths to preserve Columbus’s 
monumental presence in America. 
Most statues taken down across the 
country in the last few years have 
stayed down, but local campaigns 
to restore them, in some cases, have 
been successful, or at least noisy. 
In Pittsburgh, an Italian Ameri­
can group has been in the process 
of suing the city since October of 
2020, in response to their Colum­
bus statue’s removal. In South 
Philly, a judge—who appeared on 
a podcast with QAnon organiz­
ers earlier this year, and was listed 
as speaker at a QAnon event she 
says she didn’t attend—reversed 
a decision made by city officials 
to remove their Columbus statue. 
City officials in Bridgeport voted 
to return their Columbus Statue 
months after voting to remove it, 
though the decision was reversed 
again a few hours before the statue 
was to be returned. 

Monuments are limited arti­
facts—and, 
ironically, 
Calzetta 
and IAWGNH’s lawsuit gestures 
towards this fact. Statues depicting 
historical figures feed the reduc­
tionist mode of historical think­
ing that has driven unwavering 
support for ‘heroes’ who are often 
anything but. In many cases, mon­
uments arise from—and perpetu­
ate, even—the same kind of Amer­
ican myth-making that views the 
acknowledgement 
of 
structural 
oppresion’s role in this country’s 
history as an existential threat; it’s 
the very approach of those who 
deem critical race theory to be an 
erasure of “Western history” and 
who agitate over the 1619 Proj­
ect’s reframing of history in terms 
of slavery and racial oppression. 
America’s and New Haven’s recent 
confrontation over monuments 
is more than a matter of political 
tip-toeing to appease proponents 
of old monuments and devise new 
monuments to fill space once held 
for racist symbols; it is also a fun­
damental reflection of the finite 
capacity of monuments to serve 
as meaningful vessels for pub­
lic memory at all. Representation 
matters in the public imagina­
tion—and new monuments that 
prioritize marginalized voices can 
offer a valuable solution, especially 
in a country where monuments 
remain ever-present in public 
spaces. But the failures of the Elm 
City’s approach to replacing their 
Columbus statue also show that 
reframing history, improving rep­
resentation, and creating dialogue 
between two partisan camps might 
be best achieved through other
