looking down on other scholars like gender theorists. 

And outside of academic discourse, Classics has been 
embraced by some extremists and white supremacists 
as a kind of symbol for the West. 

By the time everyone arrived, thirteen undergrad­
uates, graduate students, and professors occupied the 
conference room, sitting in chairs against the wall, 
around the big oak table, or broadcasted on the Zoom 
call displayed on the TV. The group was small, but 
they filled the room and there were few open chairs 
left as the meeting began. Many of the older students 
sat against the wall by the door, while the discussion 
leader, two attending co-founders, and Professor 
Christina Kraus sat at the table. Though the group 
was racially diverse, the discussion leader and the 
club’s three founders were white. Was it possible for 
a group like this to succeed in its goal of countering 
racism in the field?

The group quickly came together in conversation, 
and I instantly felt out of my depth. There were no 
other observers, perhaps in part because all of the 
group’s advertising is through internal departmental 
email lists—whether it's their undergraduate panlist 
or the departmental Pinax list—and it rarely sees any 
visitors outside of the Classics department. A typical 
meeting has anywhere from five to thirty people, all of 
whom are part of the department. Though MacDon­
ald noted that they’d reached out to other department 
heads to scout interest in an interdisciplinary collab­
oration, she said they hadn’t received any responses. 

I
t’s rare to find something nowadays without any 
digital footprint, but the Yale Classics Anti-Rac­
ism Reading Group is about as close as it gets. A 
quick search for the group yielded three links: one to 
the Yale Classics Summer 2021 newsletter, and two 
to a departmental calendar listing the meeting I was 
about to attend. With this painfully limited knowl­
edge under my belt, I walked into the room in Phelps 
Hall unsure of what I would find. 

The handful of students in the room were just as 
shocked to see me as I was to see them. Nevertheless, 
after the initial surprise, I was greeted warmly by two 
of the group's founders, Elizabeth Raab ’23 and Grace 
MacDonald ’23. I took a seat at the table in the center 
of the small room and watched as more people slowly 
trickled in. 

“I was so surprised when you came,” MacDonald 
later admitted. “Classics sometimes can be so insu­
lated.”

Despite its goal of inclusivity and anti-racism, the 
group is not immune to the isolation of the Clas­
sics department. Historically, that isolation has been 
strongly tied to the field’s conservatism, and often its 
racism. The discipline has relied on its rigidity, cham­
pioning the same texts, philosophies, and scholars for 
centuries. The problem has carried over into the pres­
ent day. As many in the group pointed out during 
their discussion, contemporary dialogue in the field 
still focuses conversation around “true Classicists”—
who are overwhelmingly white and male—while 


The discussion, led by Grace Blaxill ‘23, focused on 
Simon Goldhill’s Review of Patrick J. Finglass’ Intro­
duction to Sophocles, in which Goldhill critiques 
Finglass for perpetuating a conservative framing of 
the Classics that omits gender, politics, and cultural 
commentary. Much of the discussion focused on the 
idea that these academic introductions are not neutral; 
scholars push their own views of the texts by exclud­
ing certain parts of texts in their analyses or piecing 
together fragments to suggest a different key take­
away. 

Late in the semester, by the time I visited them, 
the group had already exhausted the reading list of 
eight pieces selected by former Yale Professor Emily 
Greenwood, and the discussion I sat in on was not 
explicitly related to antiracism. These readings from 
earlier in the year included articles like “Lessons 
Learned: The Role of Classics in Black Colleges and 
Universities” and “Turning the Tables on Dominance 
and Diversity in Classics.” Greenwood, who was Yale 
Classics’ only Black professor, now teaches at Princ­
eton, leaving the Yale Classics Department faculty of 
sixteen without any Black members. 

The reading group seemed to be at a critical moment 
of negotiating their identity, poised to explore a more 
intersectional analysis of Classics within gendered, 
political, and broader cultural lenses. After exhaust­
ing the anti-racist reading list, it was now up to the 
group’s leaders to decide where to direct the discus­
sions. Blaxill’s conversation delved into sexism and 
elitism in Classics, while the December meeting dis­
cussed ableism in Classics. The group is now broad­
ening its scope from anti-racism to wider discussions 
of discrimination in the field. 

Group members emphasized that though texts stay 
the same, field commentary should be dynamic. The 
push for more contemporary framing and analysis of 
texts reveals the battle to begin undoing the racist 
underpinnings of Classics, which traces back to the 
group’s inception in the spring of 2020. Jake Watson 
’22 says the idea for the group came to him in his 
junior year, when he noticed that one of the required 
textbooks on The Odyssey for his and Raab’s class on 
Homer used the n-word without any scholarly justi­
fication. He explained that the carelessness of its use 
“really jarringly put it in our face how entwined Clas­
sics is with racist histories.”

After a conversation with his professor and a class 
discussion of racism in the field, Watson began work­
ing with the professor, Raab, and another interested 
classmate to try to get the publisher to remove the 
word from the book. Eventually, after lengthy nego­
tiations, the publishing company promised to add a 
note in the front of the text warning readers of the 
slur. As Watson and Raab were negotiating with the 
publisher, a second impetus for the group emerged. 
George Floyd’s murder, and the national conversation 
on racism that followed, pushed the students to take 
further action. Raab, Watson, and MacDonald formed 
the anti-racist reading group aiming to educate them­
selves, to seek out challenging conversations, and 
eventually to take action. One of its main goals now 
is reassessing Yale’s Classics class structure and con­
tent. Specific demands, or action items beyond that, 
are still unclear.

Though group members said the Classics Depart­
ment has been supportive of their mission since the 
club’s inception, Watson hinted at a slight tension 
between faculty and student priorities. He noted that 
when debating whether or not to keep The Odyssey 
commentary that used the n-word on the syllabus, 
some faculty argued it was the best book available 
due to a lower price and more comprehensive analysis 
than other textbooks.  Faculty wondered whether it 
would be more exclusive for students to have to buy 
“a really expensive textbook that is not as good for 
pedagogy and doesn't cover as much of The Odys­
sey,” Watson said. “So I think there was some of that 
power dynamic there and generational difference. 
Inertia is a really strong force.”


“The reading group seemed to be at a critical moment 
intersectional analysis of Classics within gendered, polit­
ical, and broader cultural lenses.”

Though the professor now teaching the Homer 
class has removed the textbook with the n-word from 
the syllabus, Watson notes that “that wasn't really a 
departmental choice…. that was just what the instruc­
tor decided.” The lack of departmental accord over 
this change in curriculum reveals a deeper slowness to 
change in the field. 

In the Phelps Hall meeting, Professor Kraus largely 
listened. She spoke a few times, framing her contribu­
tions with her extensive time in the field and speaking 
about the lack of proper credit given to female schol­
ars. Group leaders said that more professors attended 
meetings during the pandemic, when they were not 
as busy, and now usually one or two come to each 
meeting.

Despite the sometimes slow pace of progress, group 
members I talked to were quick to emphasize that 
their goals aren’t in conflict with those of the depart­
ment, and that they haven’t faced resistance beyond 
differences in priorities. In fact, the two groups often 
work together. The Classics’ Departmental Equity, 
Justice, and Inclusion Committee formed at about 
the same time as the reading group, and the two are 
becoming more interconnected. Both Raab and read­
ing group co-leader Ziming Liu serve as members on 
the Committee, which has two faculty, graduate, and 
undergraduate appointments apiece.

This overlap is understandable considering the size 
of the department. Each year, faculty in the depart­
ment outnumber the graduating seniors by a ratio of 
roughly two to one. Raab recalled attending a special 
graduation ceremony for Classics majors that featured 
seven seniors. That year was not an anomaly—the 
major’s average graduating senior class size is only 
nine students.

It may be no surprise, then, that the students start­
ing the push for change look like those who have his­
torically been in the department. The group leaders 
were not oblivious to the optics of their operation. 
Watson explained that the founders’ whiteness, lack 
of knowledge about anti-racism in the field, and the 
surrounding whiteness of the Yale Classics depart­
ment made starting the group a delicate process. “We 
just try the best we can,” Watson said.

All of the group leaders emphasized that they do 
not claim to be experts on anti-racism. The commu­
nal learning of the group was something that made it 
special to them. This transparent framing of the group 
as an open place to learn helped counter some of the 
elitist and exclusionary history of Classics. Instead of 
the group leaders assuming the role of all-knowing 
instructors, they learned alongside those in discus­
sions. 

“Our goal is to put everyone on sort of an equal 
playing field—discussion—which often can be hard in 
an academic setting where there are professors, grad­
uate students, there are all of these hierarchies,” Raab 
explained. “But in other ways it's hard, right? Because 
we want to be as responsible as possible in including 
the voices that should be included, whether that be 
in our readings, our participants, the people who we 
invite in to lead discussions.”

Though leaders expressed their belief that those 
most interested in reforming Classics would be those 
in Classics themselves, they’re beginning to widen 
their lens. MacDonald and Raab explained, for exam­
ple, that they’re working on a collaboration with the 
Yale Prison Education Initiative next semester in an 
attempt to counter the inaccessibility and elitist cul­
ture of Classics. 

Despite being small, the group fights complete 
insulation. Members have participated in numerous 
multi-college events, including Eos Reads for Black 
Lives, a workshop where participants read a selec­
tion of texts from the African diaspora and considered 
their current implications. Raab and MacDonald also 
mentioned their “Accountability Groups,” in which 
professors and students from colleges nationwide 
meet and discuss anti-racist literature.

For now, the group is largely focused on curricu­
lum-based work. Friday’s meeting ended with a list 
“The push for more contem­
porary framing and analysis 
of texts reveals the battle 
to begin undoing the racist 
underpinnings of Classics, 
which traces back to the 
group’s inception in the 
spring of 2020.”
