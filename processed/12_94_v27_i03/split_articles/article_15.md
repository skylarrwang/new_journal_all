Does the world-famous School of Drama see cooperation with 
undergraduate theater as 
The Next Stage? 
I
n the office of Stan Wojewodski (pronounced Voya-VUD-ski), 
Dean of the Yale School of Drama, hangs a framed needlepoint 
sign with rhe Bantu phrase, "A person is a person because of 
orher persons." The greeting conveys a 
sense of the community which the drama 
school faculty and students hail as one of 
the finer points of their institution. But 
gaining entrance into the community 
requires, in the single word of Associate 
Dean Earl Gister, "Talenr." Wojewodski 
adds, "We look for talenr, passion, and 
intelligence." Only accepting 67 srudenrs 
out of last year's applicant pool of l, 164, 
the Yale Drama School boasrs a gifted dire 
whose alums include Meryl Streep and 
Henry Winkler. 

The undergraduate community also 
harbors great theater. James DePaul, the 
director of undergraduate studies for the 
rheater studies departmenr, esrimares he saw 
67 student productions lasr year; he missed 
at least 20. "They're enthusiastic and 
inspiring," 
DePaul 
says 
of 
the 
undergraduate dramatists. Acting instructor 
Bill Walters attests, "They're extremely 
intelligent and really capable." Their talents 
create one of the 
most vibrant 
undergraduate theater scenes in the country. , 
Despire the quality and virality of both 
theater communities, surprisingly lirrle 
interaction occurs berween them. As actor Max Chalawasky (DRA 
'96) admirs, "The Drama School is a litde world unto irself." This 
lofry and rarefied world firsr came inro exisrence in 1924 as the 
simple Deparrmenr of Drama at the School of Fine Arts. Students 
registered in rhe fall of 1925, and the first Masrer of Fine Arts in 
Drama was conferred in 1931. In 1955, rhe Yale Corporarion 
reorganized the depanmenr as a separare professional school offering 
both a master's degree and a docroral degree. The school founded the 
Yale Repenory Theatre in 1967 to enhance srudenr

students: "(I) Yale Repertory Theatre; (2) classes; (3) major 
productions of the Yale School of Drama." The primacy of the Rep

may surprise more academically focused 
undergraduates. Elizabeth Cohen (DRA 
'95) explains: "The school has an intricate, 
symbiotic relationship ro rhe Rep." Ray 
Inkel (DRA '95) describes rhe Rep in less 
philosophical rerms: "They've made an old 
church inro a rremendous place ro learn." 
The Rep, a member of rhe professional 
League of Residence Thearres, gives 
srudenrs in all disciplines of rhe school rhe 
opporruniry ro collaborare wirh fellow 
srudenrs, 
professors, 
and

The School's emphasis on practical rraining, both ar the Rep and 
in School producrions, makes for grueling schedules. Srudenrs 
rypically have classes from 9 a.m. ro 2 p.m. and rehearsal from 2:30 
p.m. to II p.m., rhough rehearsals often run until 1 a.m. Catherine 
Mardis (DRA '98), a firsr year srudenr who began working on a 
producrion a couple of weeks into rhe semester, describes her 
commitmenr ro the Drama School in Faustian terms. ''I've sold my 
soul ro Yale for rhree years." Chalawasky is even 
more blunr: "Ir's hell." But few studenrs would be 
willing ro give up rhe rremendous production

experience for a little more sleep. 

Chalawasky feels that the Rep's hectic 
schedule forges internal strength: "You find 
resources inside yourself and you gain self-
confidence." 

The rigors of the program often require 
moments of release. When asked about 
drama student social life, actor Trevor 
Anthony (ORA '95) jokes, "I didn't know I 
had a life." Drama students hang out-
almost exclusively with other drama 
students-at Kavanaugh's, the Cabaret, and 
monthly all-school parties. "We throw a 
wild party when we want to," says director 
Derek Jones (ORA '95). "First year you go 
crazy; second year you reign it in; and third 
year you know when to drink and when not 
to. , 

Jones adds, however, that the 
raucousness of drama student life is 
countered by a tendency to become 
"hermetic."· Students consistently lament 
their isolat-ion from the rest of Yale, 
especially with respect to the undergraduate 
theater community. Most students view the 
·separation as a product of their hectic 
schedules. Others see it as a result of the 
school's exclusive claim on their talents and 
time. The course book spells this out: 
"Acting in projects outside the School is 
discouraged and permission to do so is 
rarely given." Such restrictions, whether 
explicit or implicit, extend to many other 
drama school departments. 

Cooperative efforts between the Drama 
School and the undergraduate theater 
community occur only rarely. Last year 
witnessed playwright Karen Ackerman's 
collaboration with three seniors in a 
Silliman D ramatic Attic production. In 
addition, Alessandro Nivola (BK '94) was 
cast in two Drama School productions. Such 
undergraduate involvement can be beneficial 
for both parties-the school receives needed 
help, and the undergraduate gains 
knowledge. Miriam Crowe (CC '96) served 
as assistant light designer for a Rep show last 
spring. "It was great experience," says 
Crowe, "because the show was bigger, more 
organized, and more professional than the 
other shows I've worked on." She also 
gained technical knowledge that she could 


not have received in an undergraduate show. 
But Crowe's experience remains quite 
unusual. Few undergrads work on school 
productions and even those few who do 
participate only in a limited technical 
capacity. And if you ask most of the 
undergraduates involved in theater about 
the Drama School, they will confess that 
they do not know much about it. Most have 
never met anyone who goes there. 

Such ignorance reflects both the Drama 
School's insularity and the undergraduate 
theater communiry's self-sufficiency. Almost 
all undergraduate shows are run exclusively 
by undergraduates with financial support 
from residential colleges and the Sudler 
Fund. Although a core group of the 
theatrically involved exists, the productions 
attract a diverse cross-section of the 
undergrad population, as well as a wide 
variery of theatrical experience and academic 
interests. Productions exist independently of 
the theater studies major, and theater studies 
faculty members do not advise undergrad 
productions outside of senior projects for 
the major. 

The Drama School shares space with the 
Yale Dramatic Association, the major 
undergraduate theater organization. When 
the school was constructed in the 1930s, the 
Dramat paid for 30 percent of the building 
cost. In exchange, the Dramat secured a 
meeting space in the school and access to 
the school theater space for productions 
nine times per year. Relations between the 
Dramat and the Drama School have 
fluctuated. A close alliance before World 
War II gave way to hos.tility in the late 
1960s. Relations are strong today, thanks in 
pan to an agreement signed five years ago 
that articulated both groups' responsibilities 
in sharing school space. Yet the Dramat and 
the Drama School continue to function as 
completely separate entities. Although the 
Dramat's 
technical 
advisor, 
Mark 
MacDonald, is a school faculty member, 
little contact between graduate and 
undergraduate students occurs. School 
students occasionally work as designers for 
Dramat productions, but such work is often 
discouraged by school administrators. 
Rasmus Johansen {BR '95), former secretary


of the Dramat, characterizes the interaction 
between the Dramat and the school as 
"tiny." But Dramat President Nicholas de 
Moncheaux (CC '95) suggests that the scene 
may be changing. "The barriers of ignorance 
are slowly breaking down." 

The possibiliry for collaborative projects 
lies mainly in the Cabaret. Founded in 
1968, the Cabaret, an extension of the 
Drama School, focuses on innovative 
performances unsupervised by faculty. The 
Cabaret hires undergraduates as waiters and 
currently has 221 undergrad members who 
subscribe to all twenty shows. J .] . Hickey 
(ORA '95), a theater management student 
who serves as artistic director of the Cabaret, 
suggests the possibility of a benefit Cabaret 
in which undergraduate actors can 
participate. "We do feel isolated from the 
Yale community," he admits, "but we're 
always looking for ways to be more 
involved," he says. 

Another realm of increased undergrad 
interaction with the school's faculty and 
students is the classroom. Several classes in 
the design, dramaturgy and dramatic 
criticism, 
TD&P, 
theater 
management departments are open to 
undergraduates; courses in acting, 
directing, and playwriting are not. Last 
year Shannon Emmerick (PC '95) was 
one of rwo undergrads who took Drama 
6, Survey of Theater and Drama; her 
freshman year, she took Theater Studies 
I1 0, which covers much of the same 
material. "It was completely different 
from IIO," she asserts. "The drama 
students have so much to bring to 
class. They're not afraid to speak 
up and be passionate, even if 
they just want to say a play is 
boring." She is now enrolled 
in the school's American 
Theater Practice course. 

Graduate students 
v1ew 
classes 
with 
undergraduates as a 
positive experience. · 
Designer Daphne 
Klein (ORA '95) 
recently rook a 
costume class 
that included undergraduates. "The 
undergrads seemed to get a lot out of it," she 
notes. "And I learned from them-they had 
no preconceived notions about the theater, 
so their ideas were very exciting." 

For the first time this year, the Drama 
studies department are teaching Drama 6 
and Theater Studies II 0 to a joint audience. 
After a 50-minute lecture, the rwo groups 
separate and have discussion sections on 
alternate mornings. The professor, Marc 
Robinson, has an appointment in both 
programs. Still the classroom provides one 
of the few places where graduate students 
and undergraduates can forge friendships; 
Emmerick still keeps in contact with the 
drama students she met last year in Drama 
6, and they try to see each other's 
productions.
