recommendations, the students did not 
even investigate the area closely. "Site 
observations were made from a distance as 
the area was deemed too dangerous to 
enter," their report states. 

The Forestry School report also 
suggests that the canal would benefit 
educational programs and schools in 
Newhallville and Dixwell. The Forestry 
School has already begun work on this idea. 
In the spring of 1994, they worked with 
classes in two high schools and one 
elementary school, to teach about various 
environmental concerns, historical aspects, 
and issues of maintenance and use of the 
canaL Beyond that, little actual work has 
been done to implement these kinds of 
programs. 

The limitations of a group of Yale 
students working to come up with a plan 
for implementation of such a controversial 
project are obvious. Yet to date, the 1988 
design by Balmori's firm and the work of 
the Forestry School have been the only 
attempts made at specific planning. 

Though their reports and conclusions have 
been made available to city officials and 
anyone involved with the Canal project, 
the Forestry School's "work was never 
meant to be an implementable plan," said 
Leigh Shemitz, president of Urban 
Resources Initiative. 

Alderman, while cautious not to insult 
the Forestry School students, said, "Their 
work was not really helpful-except as a 
good case study." Although the forestry 
students have come closest to addressing 
more of the wide-ranging issues of the 
greenway implementation and suggest that 
FCRTA's build-it-and-see-what-happens 
attitude needs to be reevaluated, FCRTA 
has virtually ignored their work and has 
continued to push the ciry to build the 
trail. 

The city is not presently undertaking 
any efforts to assess the feasibility of the 
trail. Pam Kressman, Deputy Director of 
the New Haven Parks Department, said, 
"The city hasn't done any planning for the 
trail, though we have knowledge of the 
work of the Forestry School." 

Despite the lack of a concrete plan, 
little research by the city, and only vague 
recommendations from the Forestry 
School, a grant is currently being written 
by Kressman, Janet Lindner, an official in 
the Mayor's office and other city officials to 
apply for federal money to implement the 
trail. The city's positive reception of the 
idea may be due to the fact that the federal 
government would contribute money to 
the project. But federal money will only 
pay for the design and construction of the 
greenway. The city would have to pay for 
upkeep, management, and policing. 

Considering the city's already strapped 
resources, concerns about the fate of the 
trail are justified. 

According to Mark Phillips, TK of the 
Transportation Department, funds could 
come through the l ntermodal Service 
Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA). 
The act established a Transportation 
Enhancement program which delegates a 
certain 
percentage · ·of 
a 
state's 
transportation budget be used for 
"enhancing the system, doing something a 
little different with the money-bicycle and 
pedestrian paths, landscaping," said 
Phillips. New Haven is preparing an 
application for ISTEA funds for either 
fiscal year 1996 or 1997. Alderman claims 
that the application process is "probably 
just a fo rmality," saying that "the 
inclination is to finish a project that has 
already been started, to link [the canal) to 
Hamden and Cheshire." 

The three blocks passing through Yale's 
property are the only remaining obstacles 
to the project. Recently, the Board of 
Aldermen threatened Yale's hold on the 
property while considering Yale's request 
for a permit to begin building a co-
generation power facility. The Board tacked 
on an amendment stating that Yale would 
have to settle its differences with FCRTA 
before the city would grant the permit. 
Though the amendment was eventually 
repealed, the Board seemed to be sending a 
message to Yale that it disapproves 
interference in New Haven interests, and 
that the city wants to build the greenway. 

Taking a wait-and-see stance on the 
project, Yale does not want to address the 
issue until the city makes a more concrete 
commitment to building the trail. Susan 
Godshall ('73 LAW, '75 M.ARC) assistant 
university secretary, said that since the city 
has just begun to address the monetary and 
land acquisition issues of the trail, and has 
not made much progress on the actual 
plans, it is not necessary for Yale to act 
immediately. 

The corner of Prospect and Trumbull 
Streets, according to Godshall, "remains 
one of the prime building sites on campus." 
That site is one of theJew spaces of 
undeve.loped land on central campus, and 
Yale would understandably be reluctant to 
give up such property. 

Yale is reluctant, though, to open more 
of its land to the city without the 
knowledge that its use will be regulated. 
Godshall recognizes the concerns about 
safety issues, "We certainly support the 
trail, provided that concerns about access 
and security are addressed." 

The Forestry School report cautions 
that "the city of New Haven has limited 
. resources for maintaining or patrolling the 
greenway. The physical condition and 
social life of the Farmington Canal 
Greenway will therefore depend almost 
entirely on the initiative of the people 
living and working near it." 

The future of the Farmington Canal 
now lies in the hands of the city and its 
decisions regarding community needs. The 
issue of the park remains a challenging one. 
In a Nov. 14, 1994 statement Balmori 
wrote, 'These new parks reach the pitch of 
their social significance-and consequently, 
of their political challenge-when they 
converge with the centers of cities." Her 
statement rings true in the current debate 
about the canal project in New Haven. Yet 
hope for the canal project is not lost, for 
she continues, "It is here where the division 
between nature and human creation, 
between country and city can be bridged 
rather than sanctioned."
