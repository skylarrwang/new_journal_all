the Old Blue that the Fence Club 
represents, interest in exclusive membership 
societies may be on the rise. More than ten 
fraternities and sororities have appeared in 
recent years; all have sizeable memberships 
and parties packed with undergraduates on 
the weekends. 


Along with renewed interest in 
fraternities, membership in ethnic and 
cultural groups has increased. Whether it be 
the Greek system, cultural houses, or literary 
discussion societies such as Sr. Anthony 
Hall, students are searching for a place 
where they can retreat from the relentless 
pace of Yale life. 


The students reviving the Fence Club 
also felt Yale is too large for them to meet 
a variety of people. By the end of their 
freshman year, Fogg and John Levinson 
(SY '97) felt trapped by their social 
activities. Both wanted to meet people 
outside of their residential colleges and 
chosen activities. However, neither found 
the external venue to 
have 
real 
conversations and form friendships. They 
had considered joining fraternities, but 
neither wished to align himself with a 
single fraternity, as that might offend 
friends in other fraternities. 


Over the summer, a group of six 
students officially planned to open the 
Fence Club again. As they wrote in one of 
their original pledge commitments: "We 
are not dreaming anymore and it is time 
that we band together and operate as The 
Fence Club. We will raise the money we 
need to buy a house, from the alums, but 
until then we will start operating just as 
the old Fence did, with members paying 
dues, organizing weekly dinners/meetings, 
and whatever else it is we decide to do for 
fun. It is important that we look to the 
future with a house and a smooth 
operating program but it is more 
important that we deal with what is going 
on right now and not lose sight of the fact 
that we are a solid number of people 
committed to a common goal." 


Fogg, Levinson, and others began a 
subtle recruiting process, talking to 
close friends who, Fogg says, are 
"good people, with motivation." 


Most of the core members already 
knew each other from a pool of friends 
self-described as having good judgment of 
character and the right goals in mind. The 
first meetings, held in restaurants, 
students' rooms, and the Berkeley College 
Swiss Room, informed the invited few 
about Fence, and put plans on the table to 
form a statement of intent. 


With wood paneling and low ceilings, 
the Swiss Room captures the Old Blue 
aura of the emerging Fence club. At the 
first official meeting, each guest received a 
commitment form. Fogg, designated 
president of the emerging club, sat at the 
end of the long table, flanked by a few 
core members. The group sought to form 
a committee of 20 students-ten men and 
ten women-willing to do the legwork 
and planning required to organize a club 
from scratch, and who shared their vision. 


At the end of the meeting, the men and 
women present were asked to sign a form 
pledging their service to the reincarnation 
of the club and committing $200 each. 


The original group of six felt that more 
energy would be put into the organization 
if members had a financial stake. With the 
sense of an important adventure, the 
commitment form ended with the "Let us 
now dispense with the, 'I hope we can ... ,' 
'Maybe we'll be able to ... ,' and, 'Wouldn't 
it be nice if.. .. ' It is now time for the, 'We 
need ... ; 'We will ... ,' and 'We can ... !"' Not 
everyone signed. 


The club then focused on financial 
concerns and the house. The group 
consulted a lawyer and hired a broker to 
search for a house, still the major priority. 
The group decided to form a Trumbull 
Trust modeled after the old Fence Club's. 
Dues and alumni donations would be 
placed in the account and overseen by a 
group of alumni trustees. 


Despite initial efforts, only five of the 
final 20 steering committee members are 
women, and two of them were not invited 
until a few weeks later, when the Steering 
Committee attempted for a second time to

attract females. Of the final 20 on the 
Committee, four had fathers in the old 
Fence. 


The club continued to aim to reclaim a 
part of the past, a past that involved the 
camaraderie and community that Fence 
members felt had disappeared from Yale. 
Graham Boettcher (PC '95) began to 
search the archives for articles on the old 
Fence. Yet after the steering committee was 
formed and the members began to 
approach more students and spread the 
word that they were restarting the club, 
the group realized that in contemporary 
Yale they were less likely to draw the 
individuals they wanted if they relied 
merely on tradition. 


By the time the first statement of 
interest appeared, the generalizations of 
"common goals" and "having fun" had 
grown into a concrete vision. Their new 
statement began: "Fence shall be a group 
of women and men made up of individuals 
of differing backgrounds who shall come 
together to create and to cement 
friendships that might not otherwise be 
made. Fence offers a social opportunity at 
Yale for individuals to gather together 
across lines demarcated by other 
extracurricular circles that might not 
otherwise be crossed. Thus, Fence shall 
create a relaxed, non-university, social 
environment." 


The group also intends to get involved 
in community service projects. Both 
Levinson and Fogg had participated in 
highly structured community service 
groups in high school. They hope that the 
club will attract individuals willing to get 
involved in the community, given the right 
opportunity. As Fogg envisions: "I believe 
that community service is about showing 
up, about being there for the community, 
not just one time, but all the time in 
general. I believe we can make both a 
group effort and an individual one. In 
other words, let's make it clear to people 
that community service is something that 
should be incorporated into everyone's 
lifestyle, in some form or another, and that 
the Fence club is a club that supports that 
view."
