Don't expect any help getting there. The guards at the Yale 
University Art Gallery are not very cooperative, to say the 
least. The best way to find it may be to come upon it 
·accidentally. Glimpse a three-cornered hat around a 
winding gallery corridor and investigate. At the far end of the third 
floor-past the Neptune statue and the furniture exhibits-the 
Trumbull Gallery conjures up a vintage nineteenth-century museum. 
Plush red walls and creaking pine floors house statuary, potted 
plants, and canvases in gilded frames. 

The framed pictures only come into focus once the feel of the 
Trumbull Gallery seeps in. But don't rush the transformation. 
Wandering around art galleries, like hunting treasure, always 
promises one more masterpiece tucked in one more dusty corner. On 
the rear wall of this third-floor room lies a thrill among tucked-away 
masterpieces. Hanging in symmetrical rows, The Declaration of 
Independence, The Battle of Bunker's Hi/~ The Surrender at Yorktown, 
and the rest of these patriotically over-exposed images glow intensely 
despite their cracked oil paint. Don't be overwhelmed by the sheer 
bulk of Americana. Nose right up and point to the familiar founding 
fathers portrayed in Colonel John Trumbull's American 
Revolutionary War paintings. 

Make sure not to miss the rear wall, center. Experiencing the 
signing, battles, and surrenders requires peering closely, but standing 
back is the only way to appreciate this strong vertical. In Trumbull's 
92V2 by 63 inch portrait, vivid patches of Continental blue and 
faded-breeches yellow define the uniform of His Excellency, 
sometime General George Washington. With distant eyes, the 
General beckons. Out-stretched hand clutches field-glasses. Forget 
the copies in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda, the General implores: here 
are the originals. Forget 
Williamsburg and Disney-
land: step into history. 
Roxbury, Massachusetts, after 
3p.m.:]uly 17, 1775. 

Booming cannon shot 
puffed overhead. Back 
over the stone fence, 
retreat had been signaled. A 
soldier crumpled and cried 
out, "I've been killed." 
Kneeling down to support 
him, the adjutant to General 
Spencer's First Connecticut 
inspected 
the 
groaning 
Continental. No, he couldn't 
be dying, reasoned John Trumbull-for that was the adjutant's name. 
There was no blood. He bade the man rise. But the fallen soldier 
would not budge. Trumbull-no expert himself, as this was his first 
skirmish ever-
called for a stretcher. He promptly returned to 
supervising the rear of the regiment as it abandoned its exposed 
position. 

Their maneuver had only been a diversion. No use wasting 
bodies; the real struggle was four miles away, or a,r least it appeared 
that way from what Trumbull could make out with his field glasses. 
He peered through the gunpowder haze that covered the distant hill 
across Boston harbor. Parches of color betrayed the enemy-
charging, retreating, and rallying again. But as Trumbull squinted, he 
could not prevent his one good eye from blending the distant battle's 
Continental blue, faded-breeches yellow, and redcoat scarlet into a 
shape that bore an unavoidable resemblance to that fallen soldier. 

Ever since the warship Somerset's guns sounded daybreak, 
. Trumbull had spent hours in rapt fascination along with the rest of 
the regiment's ·:piquet-guard." Placed on alert, the entire minuteman 
army gazed toward that distant summit. Like the others-called Sons 
of Liberty this side of the fortifications, traitorous rebels on the 
other-Trumbull and his regiment had only recently arrived. 
Pitching camp in Roxbury, they had joined the swelling ring of Sons 
of Liberty surrounding H is Majesty's forces quartered in Boston. 
Tired of merely taunting redcoats, Trumbull looked over to the 
blazing hill, yearning to play a part in provolcing the British to sally 
forth from fortress Bosron. 

Then the orders had passed down the ranks: form up and parade. 
The British cannoneers responded co these colonial displays shortly. 
Less than eager to precipitate an engagement on another flank, 
Spencer's regiment retreated 
and saw no further action. It 
was not until far into the night 
that Adjutant Trumbull 
discovered that the little hill in 
his field glasses was known as 
Bunker's (or Breed's) Hill, and 
that on its summit, 
a 
detachment of the Sons of 
Liberty had resisted three 
British 
charges 
before 
succumbing-a moral victory 
against seasoned professionals. 
But while fellow Sons of 
Liberty proved themselves in 
fierce hand-to-hand fighting 
on that day, Trumbull's 
regiment had watched the
