to Siegel's assertion that no condition is 100 
percent terminal. As Selzer put it, "There 
must be a rime to say 'enough."' Dr. Merrell 
echoes, "Sometimes, there's nothing that 
can be done, and it's best for the patient to 
peacefully accept the future." 

Siegel's zeal in advocating his theories 
appears limitless. "I know a patient is 
ready to fight cancer if I see they have 
my book and they have the Bible," he says. 
He also believes that within ten years 
science will have uncovered information 
supporting all his theories. 

Siegel's faith in himself has only 
distanced him further from the medical 
mainstream. "With so much enthusiasm, 
this type of thing is likely to take on all the 
flavor of a religious revival," says Selzer. 
"Part of the popularity lies in Bernie's 
magnetic personal charisma, and I think 
there's a real danger in dispensing hope by 
the mouthful to those without hope, in the 
way a priest dispenses absolution." 

Bernie Siegel does like to speak in 
absolutes, but discussing cancer and the 
human mind presents dual realms of 
uncertainty. Bernie Siegel dwells amidst this 
uncertainty. Accordingly, the motto of 
ECaP reads, "In the face of uncertainty, 
there is nothing wrong with hope." That 
intangible, immeasurable hope may have 
helped many cancer patients to live better 
lives. As Selzer puts it, "Bernie has served a 
great purpose and filled a need for so many 
people that even the skeptic has to marvel 
and commend him. I certainly do. And 
maybe someday Bernie will perform 
miracles. And then won't I fall down on my 
knees." 

Bernie Siegel believes that he has 
performed miracles. Every time he witnesses 
a cancer patient changing his or her life and 
learning to fight the disease, he sees a 
miracle. Until the medical profession 
embraces miracles, however, Siegel's 
enormous popular acclaim will dwell in the 
shadow of professional doubt.
