Eurail through Yale 
While working in New Haven chis summer, I finally got the chance to see Europe. I didn't exactly go to Europe rather, Europe came to me. For two weeks a little bit of rhe Continent descended upon Old Campus in the form of 1,100 high school exchange students, hailing from various pares of Wesrern Europe, forming a scaled-down version of the European Communiry within the confines of rhese Ivy walls. And my Eurail pass co this European Community was the position I held as an Resident Assistant in this Continental gathering known as the Educatio n Foundation Language and Culture Camp, the largest of many organizations chat use Yale facilities over rhe summer. 

The Camp provided exchange students a two-week orientation to rhe English language and American culture before rhey dispersed co host families all over rhe United States. Like Yale's fres h man orientation period- a.k.a. "Camp Yale"-this Camp saw Old Campus teeming with excited studenrs, ready to embark on a journey into another world. Along with chis excitement also came the fear of the unknown, which prompted the studenrs to move in packs of 10 or 20 (resembling a frosh class). These roving packs, moving in amoeba-like fashion, proved frustrating for some pedestrians, who were engulfed by "pseudopods" of blond-haired kids, speaking Swedish or German. 

What was my role in all this? My duties as an R.A. entailed supervising and providing assisrance to the administrators higher up, much like a camp counselor. However, underlying these standard tasks, the most important aspect of my job was trying to dispel their misconceptions of Americans and American culture. This proved to be an interesting experience, as educational for me as it was for them. 

Much of what these kids perceived to be American was gathered from the American pop culture imported into their countries. When I told one student I was from Southern California, she inquired whether or nor my address included the zipcode 90210. She assumed that since I attend Yale, I must be rich. And the rich inÂ· California live beside the Walshes in Beverly Hills. Hence, by the transitive property of equality, I must live in Beverly Hills. It wasn't long before I informed her that student loan repayments would eat a hole in my pocket for a long time to come. For two German aficionados of gangsta rap, America was a fantasyland, occupied by gangbangers with big guns and loose women. The lesson they learned was that not every American packs a rod or drinks 40 ouncers. And not everyone watches television each waking hour or at least not more than five hours a day. And not everyone frequents fast-food restaurants daily. 

To my surprise, there were a sprinkling of people of Asian descent, as well as other non-white Europeans. Although the numbers are small relative to North America, diversity is slowly breaking ground in European soil. The kids represented a variety of national cultures, each rich in irs own traditions, history, and differences. Not every Swede sees Ace
