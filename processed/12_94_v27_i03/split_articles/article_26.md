Mixed Messages

IF your life were a movie, what would the soundtrack be? But would anyone 
listen to the words? 

It all started my senior year of high school. After I got 
my first CD player for Christmas, my descent into recycled 
sentiment began almost immediately. I developed an 
ear for the perfect transition, developed a shorthand 
for disc and track numbers, learned to tally at a glance the 
combination of songs that would fill a given length of 
tape. I became a mixmaster, able to communicate not 
with my own words but with other people's music. I 
wooed and wept to the tune of personalized 
soundtracks; every car trip demanded the 
correct accompaniment. If I had a problem, 
making a mix would help me solve it. If 
I needed to tell someone something 
important, my own voice was the 
last one I would think of 
using. 

As my freshman year 
roommates unpacked 
their own spec-
tacular music 
collections, 
my heart beat 
faster. I felt that 
my 
mixes 
were 
limited only by the 
number of voices that I 
could add to them, and 
among the people on my floor 
upwards of 1,000 CDs featured 
hundreds of performers as of yet 
unknown to me. Most importantly, I 
found dozens of friends who shared my 
passion for mixing as well as my sense of 
its emotional import. One friend 
presented me with a heartfelt mix to console me about the death of 
my family's dog; another assembled 90 minutes of vaguely 
misogynistic music to ease the pain of another romance gone awry. 

Dead dogs notwithstanding, romance or the lack of it inspires 
the vast majority of all mix tapes. Call us children 
of TV, CDs, or MTV-call us Generation X if 
you must-but, alas, don't call us poets. When it 
comes to expressing love, longing, or loss, we're more likely to do 
so by throwing together a dozen songs than by penning a sonnet or 
some vers libre. In my case, at least, it seems to have boiled down to 
either/or: during my most prolific mix years, I didn't 
write a single poem. Junior high and high 
school left in their wake scores 
of inspired works of 
poetic creation-teen 
angst at its best-praising 
various objects of my 
respect, revulsion, and 
deep, true, abiding love. 
While the wider world will 
probably not miss the two 
years' worth of highly 
enjambed melancholy, I 
know I would have been 
better 
off writing 
through my emotions 
instead of splicing 
other people's lyrics 
in place of my true 
feelings. 

The realization that I was 
mixing rather than writing has made me 
think seriously about what it means to mix. 
When I began asking people about their 
mixes I found an eerie sameness, a 
claustrophobic language of cliche and 
canned sentiment. But at the same time, the 
people I talked to spoke about the mixes they give and 
receive with fierce emotion. They serve as totems and turning 
points in relationships, affirmations of friendship, and important 
coping devices that help people wrest meaning from a confusing 
environment. Their reactions convinced me that mixes and the 
phenomenon of mix-making mean something, but that this 
meaning is provisional and changing. 

My research started close to home. I called old friends and 
asked them to search around for the mixes I had 
given them over the years. First of all, for all the 
uniqueness I thought to imbue each tape with, ten 
to twenty songs make up a constant core: The Indigo Girls' "Closer 
to Fine" and U2's "With or Without You" turn up with 
embarrassing frequency. The liners feature the same scrawl with 
elegant pretensions, the similar feints at catchy titles. My friend 
Anne laughed as she psychoanalyzed song choices in hindsight of 
my coming out: my reliance on Erasure and the Pet Shop Boys 
seems hilariously stereotypical to her now. Julie, a friend from 
home I had tried doggedly to fall in love with, dug out six tapes of 
an increasingly less-subtle romantic bent; she informed me that she 
had been clueless because she never listens to song lyrics. I had to 
smile, remembering hours spent in my overdetermined English-
major mode weighing the meaning that she would rake from a 
certain track by Natalie Cole or Jesus Jones. The answer: none. But 
she assures me she loves my mixes anyway. 

I also looked, with a measure of regret, at a mix I made upon 
my return to New Haven this fall. It has sat unsent on my stereo 
for months: before I could get it in the mail, the relationship whose 
joys and pains it catalogues had devolved into a series of angry 
phone calls. There is something pathetic about the unsent mix: like 
an unmailed letter but weightier, the black tape coiled inside the 
plastic shell like the memory of kisses and broken promises. 

Unlike poetry, which is generally 
seen as having some meaning, 
mixes have the singular ability to 
be transparent. It may be too 
easy to listen to the music and 
ignore the words. 

My roommate Sara has her share of unsent mixes, too. 
They play like a diary or a travelogue, marking the transit 
of a life full of changes. She struck upon a good title early 
on and stuck with it: she has countless volumes of *College Love and 
Other Anomalies*. I know the songs mean different things in the 
context of her life, but her choices resemble mine more than they 
differ: heavy on the Indigo Girls, Peter Gabriel, and the Cowboy 
Junkies, with a little Mary-Chapin Carpenter thrown in for good 
measure. Her mixes, however, are much more artfully labelled than 
mine. 

Another friend tells me of the stack of tapes in his room that 
documents the story of a long-term relationship recently gone sour. 
The early stages, predictably, include "In Your Eyes" and "All I 
Want Is You," along with darker notes that make the whole affair 
seem doomed to failure. But that, again, is hindsight. When you 
receive a mix from your girlfriend, he tells me, you want it to be a 
love letter. 

I like the 
way a mix can make 
people treat pop songs like poems 
to be analyzed and decoded. But unlike poetry, 
which is generally seen as having some meaning, mixes have the 
singular ability to be transparent. It may just be too easy to listen to 
the music and ignore the words-just ask Julie. That's a lesson I 
had to learn the hard way. 

This may be a noble effort on the personal level, but it is likely 
to be a fatal strategy. I can almost see the culture-vultures circling. 
As fellow twenty-somethings take over the entertainment industry, 
the mix-making ethos is flourishing: no high-concept movie can 
make it without an equally high-concept soundtrack album. The 
songs need not have been in the movie anymore-they need only 
conjure up an appropriate mood or convey emotions germane to 
the film. Some soundtracks-like that for *Reality Bites*-even have 
the feel of a good mix tape, with lots of different artists' styles 
jostling against one another. Buying it is kind of like opening your 
mailbox to find a mix from Ethan Hawke. Don't be fooled. It's a 
lesson that should be included in any pop-culture primer. 

Beyond the personal and psychological qualms I have with my 
mix-making phase, the entire phenomenon seems to point 
toward a serious shift in the means and methods of self-
expression. Postmodern theory, for all its occasional abstruseness, 
offers strikingly clear terms with which to discuss mix-making. As 
popular culture becomes both the primary arena for the discussion 
of personal and political issues, and the common language in which 
these issues are framed, traditional notions of the individual nature 
of creativity become much less stable. To what extent are two 
people relating as individuals if their speech is colonized by 
references to *The Brady Bunch*, Madonna, and *My So-Called Life*? Does 
my selection of other people's songs count as an act of creativity, or 
is it mere bricolage-a scavenger's attempt at second-hand 
sentiment? Does mix-making represent a courageous attempt to 
personalize and make meaning from received pop-culture forms, or 
does it represent the abdication of creativity to well-publicized 
puppets of the music industry? These are questions I can't begin to 
answer. But I do know that I will never again allow the mixed 
message to replace my attempts at original expression. If my mixes 
can coexist with my writing (emphasis on my), fine; if I ever return 
to putting together collections of random songs instead of stanzas 
of finely tuned verse, I'll just have to stop buying blank tapes.
