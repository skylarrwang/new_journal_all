Extract ARTICLE CONTENT:
Some see the dual teaching effort of 
Drama 6/Theater Studies 110 as indicative 
of the two programs' attempts to work more 
closely together. The faculty of both schools 
have established a dialogue; in addition to 
Marc Robinson's dual appointment, James 
DePaul attends Earl Gister's acting classes, 
and Drama School faculty give guest lectures 
to undergraduates. "There are great and 
enlightening teachers at the Drama School," 
says DePaul, "and I hope our students look 
to them as role models." But DePaul is 
quick to point out the differing philosophies 
of the two programs: "Theater Studies 
strives to combine theater stuqy with the 
breadth and depth of a liberal arts 
education. The Drama School has the 
specific agenda to focus on technique and 
process." Dean Wojewodski sounds even 
firmer on the topic: "The relationship 
between the two is certainly cordial, but 
they must work indepeQdendy because of 
the nature of the schools." But Wojewodski 
suggests that there may be a path from 
theater studies to the drama school. "The 
theater studies focus on liberal arts is good 
preparation for Drama School. It produces 
richer, more informed students than ones 
that focus strictly on theater practice." 
Obi Ndefo (BR '94, ORA '97) 
exemplifies the link between theater studies 
and the Drama School. He regards the 
theater studies program as fine preparation 
for the Drama School, though he admits 
that he knew little about the Drama School 
before he began the application process. 
"The Rep is a kind of 
teaching hospital," a 
forum for practical 
learning about all 
aspects of 
professional theater. 

Ndefo would now like to see more 
interaction between the two communities he 
holds in high regard. But he, like other 
Drama School students, wonders how to 
combine the two programs. As Anthony 
asserts, "It's hard to bring undergrads who 
are mainly doing theater for the fun of it to 
a ·program where we're processing our butts 
off." 

Acting student Chalawasky proposes a 
complex, but intriguing, solution: a joint 
program which targets both groups' needs 
by providing a B.F.A. for undergraduates 
and an M.A. for graduate students. 
Although the classes would be separate, the 
physical union of the schools would foster 
more of a coherent theater community, 
co~bining the passion, talent, and 
inteUigence of botli groups. "Both programs 
need to get to the next place," Chalawasky 
points out, and the pooling of resources and 
energies could provide the right boost to this 
next place. Less drastic student p roposals 
include allowing more drama students to 
serve as teaching assistants and creating joint 
workshops and collaborative projects 
between the two schools. 

Currently, no plans exist for melding 
the two programs. But after seeing 
playwright 
Ackerman's 
successful 
collaboration with undergraduates last year, 
Mark Bly, Associate Artistic Director of the 
Yale Repertory Theatre and Drama School 
instructor, seems intrigued by the 
possibilities. "I see a very talented group in 
Yale College that we'd be interested in 
working with," he says. Associate Dean 
Gister sounds a similar tone: "We are 
constantly looking for ways for our students 
and those undergraduates who are similarly 
interested and motivated to function more 
harmoniously. The t~o groups have 
different levels of experience," he notes, "but 
they do ultimately share the same 
experience." As Gister hin ts, a new 
collaborative effort may be waiting in the 
wings.
