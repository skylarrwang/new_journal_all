flowing white gown and skullcap." Since 
that moment George has served as Siegel's 
inner guide, adviser, and invaluable 
companion. 

With George's help, Siegel came to the 
realization that eventually laid the 
groundwork for his current theories. Siegel 
turned his attention to the exceptions of 
individual cures and away from the vast 
statistics of the uncured. In essence, he

began to believe in healing miracles. He 
chose the path of possibility over the path of 
probability . 


New 
ideas 
rapidly 
accumulated 
upon this miraculous 
groundwork. In Love, 
Medicine, and Miracles, 
Siegel asserts that the 
source of-as well as 
the remedy for-a 
disease lies within the 
individual. Siegel's 
assertions follow this 
scheme: cancer- and 
all disease for that 
matter- results 
primarily 
from 
personal tension and 
unhappiness. Genetics 
and environmental 
factors 
plant 
the 
molecular seeds of 
cancer in everyone to 
varying degrees, but 
the individual's state of 
mind determines if 
those seeds will grow. If the individual lacks 
purpose or love in his life, cancer steps in to 
fill the void. Within the context of the 
central nervous system, the endocrine 
system, and the immune system, the mind 
activates "live" or "die" messages. Frame of 
mind determines which message the body 
receives. "Peace of mind sends to the body a 
'live' message, while depression, fear, and 
unresolved conflict give it a 'die' message," 
Siegel writes. 

Siegel defines "healing" as separate and 
distinct from "curing." Healing involves the 
individual's mental and emotional health, 
while curing pertains only to the direct 
physical aspects of disease. Cancer treatment 
begins by changing one's attitude towards 
life. Healing the angry and the unfulfilled 
parts of one's life establishes a new frame of 
mind more receptive to "live" messages. 
Drugs and radiation, integral to the cure of 
disease, can help patients live long enough 
to reach this change of heart, but no 
"curing" of a disease can take place without 
an initial "healing." Some people never 


reach the cure, but in Siegel's view, everyone 
can attain personal healing. "In achieving 
peace of mind," writes Siegel, "cancer may 
be healed, sight may be restored, and 
paralysis may disappear," writes Siegel. 

Siegel's prescriptions for healing follow 
logically from his convictions: bring peace 
and love into your life; forgive yourself and 
others; don't harbor resentment, anger, or 
fear; be calm, centered, and focused; don't 
forget the joy; do what makes you happy; 
find the childlike quality within you; play. 

To help people achieve these intermediate 
goals on the path to healing, Siegel outlines 
methods of introspection such as keeping a 
journal, analyzing dreams and drawings, and 
meditation. In his second book, Peace, Love, 
and Healing he offers a five-step program 
that integrates hypnosis, biofeedback, 
creative visualization, prayer, yoga, music, 
and poetry. Siegel says these treatments 
allow the patient to participate in the 
healing team process with the doctors and 
nurses. "They let the patient see their 
intuitive beliefs from the unconscious. If 
there are negative symbols then they can be 
corrected," he says. 

Siegel's direct contact with cancer 
patients has decreased since he retired from 
surgery in 1989 to devote himself full-time 
to lecturing and writing. "If I manage to 
influence training doctors, I help more 
people indirectly through the ripple effect," 
he says. In addition to Love, Medicine and 
Miracles, and Peace, Love, and Healing, he 
also authored How to Live Between Office 
Visits in 1993. 

Siegel has also reached out to people 
through Exceptional Cancer Patients 
(ECaP), a group he founded soon after 
meeting George in 1978. Siegel writes that 
an exceptional cancer patient "refuses to play 
the victim" and instead demands "dignity, 
personhood and control." ECaP, which 
recently moved its headquarters from 
downtown New Haven to Middlebury, 
operates today as a support group for 
exceptional patients. The patients meet in 
groups to meditate and express their 
feelings, thereby beginning the internal 
healing process. Siegel 
cites a number of 
independent medical 
studies, including a 
1989 
experiment 
showing that women 
with breast cancer 
who participated in 
group therapy lived 
longer than those who 
did not. Siegel also 
quotes an experiment 
which found that men 
with heart disease were 
less likely to suffer 
relapses 
if 
they 
participated in group 
sessions. 

These facts and 
figures are secondary, 
however, to Siegel's 
personal experiences. 
He has drawn his 
fundamental 
conclusions 
observing 
people 
rather than from 
analyzing data. Siegel remembers John 
Florio, a landscaper with cancer. "John said, 
'I'm going home to make the world 
beautiful and if I die that's okay,"' recalls 
Siegel. "He refused all treatment and went 
home and worked on his garden, and today 
he's over ninety years old." 

Love, Medicine, and Miracles also 
mentions Linda, a patient who refused 
chemotherapy and whose doctor told her 
that she'd come crawling back to beg for it. 
Linda said to herself, "That S.O.B.! I won't 
die, just to prove he's wrong." Linda lived 
ten years without chemotherapy before 
beginning chemo to live even longer. 

Through letters he receives, Siegel has 
heard of countless such cases. "One woman 
wrote that after she was diagnosed she wrote 
a will, gave away her treasures, laughed, 
took some vitamins, bought a dog, and 
planted a backyard landscape. She joked 
that she had beat the disease, but was so 
busy that she was killing herself," recalls 
Siegel. "That's what you have to do, though: 
burn up, not burn out." Siegel believes that 
living life to the fullest beats disease. "If you 
can beat the cancer for one year, by living 
the life you chose, then you will have shown 
all your family and friends how to live and 
how to die," he says. 


Even though Siegel's books may fly off 
bookstore shelves, they aren't landing 
in the hands of the disbelieving 
medical establishment. Siegel's initial 
assertion-that the primary cause of cancer 
is found in the mind consistently-comes 
under fire from others who treat cancer. Dr. 
Ronald Merrell, chairman of Yale's 
department of surgery, notes, "For myself, 
as for most physicians, the importance of 
the mind in disease is subliminal, not 
paramount, as it is for Dr. Siegel." 

Dr. Joseph Germino, assistant professor 
of oncology also considers Siegel's ideas 
extreme. "Maybe for some patients, mind 
over matter works, but for most patients, 
emotional therapy alone is just not 
effective," he says. Even Selzer, Siegel's 
former partner, characterizes himself as 
"naturally skeptical," preferring to place his 
faith in science and, "what actually can be 
done." 

But even those who criticize Siegel for 
his lack of scientific basis do acknowledge 
that the mind holds some influence over the 
body. Yale psychology professor Kelly 
Brownell emphasizes that, despite his 
personal belief in Siegel's ideas and Siegel's 
course of action, as a scientist, the lack of 
verified data prevents him from asserting 
Siegel's effectiveness. Having witnessed first-
hand the power of the mind, most doctors 
qualify their criticism of Siegel. Merrel says, 
"Like all surgeons, I've seen inexplicable 
recoveries, and I've witnessed the deaths of 
patients who simply gave up." 

The medical community also questions 
the consequences of Siegel's celebrity status. 
Siegel has presented his ideas on Oprah!, 
Donahue, and Good Morning America, 
among other shows. "Fame forces you to 
present yourself in a certain way," notes 
Selzer. Some doctors fear that Siegel has 
condensed cancer and treatment into 
oversimplified soundbites for the purpose of 
self-promotion and popularization. "He's 
only dealing with the issues and the 
problems on a surface level with the general 
public," says Germino. Siegel contends he 
goes on these shows "to awaken people to 
the mind-body connection," so that they 
will go and examine his theories more 
In his first book Siegel 
describes his guardian 
angel George as "a 
bearded, long-haired 
young man wearing

closely. Siegel says that he resents his 
portrayal in the popular media as a 
professional eccentric. 

In criticizing the basis and the content 
of Siegel's ideas, doctors seem to view 
him as a well-meaning man with a 
misdirected message. But a few critics go 
beyond the contention that his message is 
seriously flawed and assert that Siegel may 
actually pose a serious danger to cancer 
patients. Dr. Thomas Fynan, associate 
research scientist in medical oncology at 
Yale, says, "The basic message behind Dr. 
Siegel's ideas is that if you try harder, you 
could prevent or cure your disease, and this 
is simply not true. The causes of cancer are 
molecular and genetic, and there's a limit to 
how effective 'seminars' can be." 

Siegel's instruction for a patient to ask 
herself "Why do I need this disease?" might 
include elements of self-condemnation and 
blame. "Empowerment over certain 
elements of sickness is good," notes Fynan, 
"but you cannot empower people over the 
disease of cancer." 

"It's about examining your life, not 
blaming yourself," contends Siegel. "'False 
hope' is an oxymoron. Besides, what's the 
alternative, no hope?" According to Siegel, 
since each individual is different, each 
experience of disease is unique. Siegel 
declares that there are no incurable diseases, 
only incurable people. "Statistics can help 
you make choices, but statistics do not apply 
to individuals," he says. 

While Siegel puts his faith in hope, 
other doctors fear that patients will never 
accept the danger of a disease if they adhere
