**Title: Homeless on Yale's Gold Coast**
**Author: Kathy Hsu**
**Page number(s): 7-8**

·At one time or another, Room F 735-
nicknamed the Gold Coast- probably 
served as an office for JE. Long and 
rectangular, the common room is twice the 
normal size of most other rooms in the 
college. Located on the first floor, it seemed 
perfect those days when three flights of stairs 
stood between me and a forgotten English 
notebook. My three roommates and I didn't 
particularly want the big calf muscles 
developed from running up and down stairs, 
and we liked the space. When we moved in, 
we found that it came complete with a 
fireplace, two lamps,· plenty of electrical 
outlets, and a couple of friends named 
Walter and John. 

Walter and John are the homeless men 
who sleep on top of the two platforms 
directly beneath our windows. The hissing 
steam from the water heaters down in the JE 
basement rises, keeping the platforms warm 
on chilly nights. 

We first met John when he poked his 
head through the open window and asked 
us if we had an extra blanket. In response, 
two of us jumped up and flew across to the 
other side of the room. Somehow, I don't 
think we made a very good first impression. 

After that uncomfortable introduction, 
we tried to avoid thinking about our 
honorary guests. The windows in our 
common room are high and small, with 
thick metal screens criss-crossing the inside 
of the glass. So even if we tried, we would 
have difficulties seeing what was happening 
on the outside; we never knew if "those two 
men" were lying out there. Every so often, 
John's single cough echoed as our only 
reminder of our guests in those rare 
moments of silence in Room F 735. 

I had always prided myself on my 
community involvement and sensitivity. I 
was involved with the Yale Hunger and 
Homeless Action Project (YHHAP) and 
tutoring for English as a Second Language 
(ESL). I didn't isolate myself from the 
community around me; from time to time I 
would stick my head out from that glass 
barrier called "campus life." But no amount 
of volunteer work could deny my fear of the 
man who asked me for a blanket. 

About a month after school started, I 
finally found out more about Walter and 
John. One of my friends, a fellow student, 
having spent many an evening talking to 
some of the people on the streets, had 
gotten to know Walter, John, and other 
homeless people. Walter and John-they 
sleep next to your 
window, she explained. 
John doesn't like the 
shelter,-. 
He 
thinks 
they're too noisy; he 
thinks there are roo 
many loud people. He 
even told me he likes jail 
more than the shelters. 
But it's hard this year 
because the policemen 
are cracking down, my 
friend 
complained. 
Maybe that's why I 
haven't seen many of my 
buddies ou'tside recently. 
But maybe it's because 
they've found a place to 
sleep. 

The first time I met 
Walter, he was sirring on 
the steps near the Pierson 
walkway. I couldn't tell 
how old he was, but he 
reminded me of a very 
old man. He didn't say much. I wanted to 
ask him what he was thinking, but I was 
afraid to break his concentration. His eyes 
stared down on the ground as if intently 
watching something. I wondered what he 
watched. 

Sometimes when I see Walter on the 
street, I stop to say a few words. He doesn't 
say much; he usually nods "yes" or "no" to 
my questions. I'm not able to give him food 
and blankets every night, but in our 
conversations we may exchange something 
better.
