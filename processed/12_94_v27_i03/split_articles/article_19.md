**The Bones of Colonel John Trumbull**
**Page number(s): 22-24**

Sizer's signature 
proved well-founded. Only 34 
years after Trumbull built his 
Gallery, the Yale art collection had 
outgrown the existing space. 
Completed in 1866, Street Hall at 
the far corner of the Old Campus 
became the new college Art Building, and 
the trustees voted to remove the Trumbull 
bones from under the original gallery. 
As for the present search: once again 
there was a new art gallery under 
construction. That spring of 1928, the little 
company had assembled in Street Hall-
fulfilling the Colonel's explicit request, once 
more. They could not move the paintings 
again and leave the bones behind. The 1928 
"translation of the relics" -Sizer employed a 
Biblical allusion to heighten the drama-
occurred during spring recess to avoid 
feared student protests. 

And yet secrecy generated legends. "As 
they were carrying the very decreed coffin 
from one building to another and had got 
halfway across, the bottom fell out and out 
came John Trumbull!" wrote the Saturday 
Review of Literature. "Of course there was 
great consternation but the janitor of the 
school, a crabby old fellow named Enos, 
had a bright idea. He rushed out with a 
dustpan and broom and swept John 
Trumbull back into the coffin, which was 
turned upside down for the purpose. " 
Slander, Sizer cried, though he loved to 
include these inaccuracies in his story. 
According to him, not John's but Sarah's 
coffin gave way. Wh.atever the case, the 
bodies just barely made it across High Street 
to their new grave-site in Yale's third art 
gallery. 

And that's where we leave the old 
Colonel, Sizer concluded. But somehow, 
Sizer could never quite dismiss Trumbull as 
a mere story. The little company watched 
the body transfer without incident. Without 
incident, except for the small accident with 
Sarah-and the glimpse that Sizer caught of 
the remains of the old Colonel himself One 
glimpse imprinted the shape of groaning 
death on the new curator Sizer's memories 
of Trumbull.

researched, rough-drafted, 
annotated, and revised. 
Hand-scrawled notes, tentative short-tide 
check-lists, galley proofs, all lead to The g 
WOrks of Colonel john TrumbullÂ· Artist of the a 
American Revolution-the comprehensive 
Trumbull canon-except even that would 
not be final. Information kept pouring in; 
there was always another forgery to expose 
and discredit. 

"Have you a portrait of an ancestor, 
painted by John Trumbull of revolutionary 
fame tucked away in your attic?" wrote Alice 
Lawton in the Newton Bee. "If so, Theodore 
Sizer at Yale University would greatly 
appreciate hearing from you." With much 
fanfare, Sizer issued a public appeal for 
details pertaining to the whereabouts of 
missing Trumbull paintings. And so the 
hunt began. 

On Sizer's roll-top desk, John Trumbull's 
self-vindicating Autobiography sprawled 
before him. He combed rhe pages for 
painting references. And he seldom missed 
the opportunity to editorialize. On page 246 
of the Autobiography, Sizer underlined a 
typical Trumbullian criticism: "President 
Jefferson ... no more qualified to lead in naval 
defense, than he was in warfare on land ... he 
possessed no military talents." With a 
characteristic flourish, Sizer scribbled beside 
it, "This 30 years after [Trumbull] left the 
army. What a crack!" 

Never one to absorb himself in one 
endeavor for too long, Sizer turned to dash 
off a note to his oldest daughter-an 
illustrated affair, gently poking fun at hi~ 
own mustache which his wife was forcing 
him to shave again. Pausing, he glanced over 
his white office walls. No pictures hung for 
inspiration, not even a Trumbull. Odd for 
an art professor, but it was not that he 
enjoyed a spartan office. He just liked art 
too much-"I don't care how, when, why, or 
where it is made." Sizer simply could not 
choose a single image to live with. 

Not even a Trumbull? He brushed off 
the old Colonel, matter-of-factly. "You 
know how one gets into these things." Ever 
since the reinternment early in his Yale
