((Nature has but

Colours, Yellow, Red & Blue, 
from which all others arise by 
composition." Reciting the 
lessons of his teacher, the well-renowned Benjamin West, 
Colonel Trumbull laid out the 
pigments on his wooden 
palette. Except he omitted 
blue; he never started out with 
pure blue. Palette in one hand, 
hog's hair brush-which he 
referred to as his pencil-in 
the other, he surveyed the half-
finished canvas. His eyes 
roamed over the year-old 
sketches strewn about his easel. 
He always felt he had started 
painting so late 
in life.

the door summoned him to prison. Suspected of treason, the 
Colonel was deported.



As soon as the peace treaty was sealed, 
Trumbull went against his venerable father's 
wishes and found his way back to art, to 
West, and to London. But standing in front 
of the splotched canvas, Trumbull could 
hardly denounce the earlier adventures his 
father had forced on him. Before his eyes, 
the colonies had transformed into an 
indep.endent nation. He had been there 
while it happened, even served as an aide-
de-camp to his idol General Washington. 
The upper echelons of American, and even 
European, society were his domains by 
birth, by military distinction, and by his 
privileged position as an emerging painter 
under the tutelage ofWest. 



Still, what was to be his life work? West, 
with one painting- Th~ Death of General 
Wolft, had catapulted himself to fame. 
Departing from classical material, West had 
shocked the cultured classes by depicting a 
modern event: the tragic death of General 
James Wolfe just as a messenger announced 
the British victorious outside Quebec. 
West's work, though, could only be 
copied so many times. With West's and 
Thomas Jefferson's encouragement, 
Trumbull hit upon a plan. He wrote to a 
friend: "I am now ... employ'd writing, in my 
language, the History of our Country." His 
own language was painting, and he resolyed 
to preserve the scenes he had witnessed. 
But 11 years was a long time. Trumbull 
probed his memories, recalling the terrain 
and the faces which contributed to the 
young nation's founding moments. To 
commence what he envisioned as a grand 
series of Revolutionary War engravings, he 
chose that first encounter with death on that 
memorable day of the Battle of Bunker's 
Hill. 



His paintings were hardly eyewitness 
accounts. Trumbull searched for the battle's 
central drama. Ever emulating West's D~ath 
of Gen~rai Wolft, the Colonel knew he 
needed a glorious martyr. Dr. Joseph 
Warren, President of the Massachusetts 
General Assembly, was the logical choice. 
Despite protests that a leading patriot was 
too valuable to endanger, Warren insisted on 
staying on the hill. As the British overran 
the summit, a bullet slammed into Warren's 
head. 



A dead unknown 
soldier, a dead patriot 
leader-as Trumbull 
sketched they meshed 
into one transcendent 
image on the canvas. 
Through 
his 
own 
experience, Trumbull 
penetrated the action on 
Bunker's Hill. History 
sprang from the pallet-
tinged with Continental 
blue, faded-breeches 
yellow, and redcoat 
scarlet. 
Still something was 
lacking. No amount of 
squinting could capture 
the actual likeness of the 
personages of this event. 
Trumbull realized he 
would have to hunt 
down as many of the 
participants as possible 
On the canvas, Bunker's HHI sloped in the fo 
go had gained exceptional powers of resolu 
to balance his historical drama with some 
degree of historical accuracy. 



So Colonel Trumbull rolled up the 
rough versions of the major historical works. 
He left West's studio and set off to persuade 
those he knew, had known, or could meet, 
to pose so he could fiJI in the oval spots left 
blank in anticipation of facial portraits. 
Obtaining an interview, he did not waste 
time sketching. While Alexander Hamilton 
or Sam Adams sat, Trumbull found the 
proper oval, picked up his pallet, and 
commenced. Even Washington was 
impressed. In a letter to Lafayette, he 
commented, "Trumbull has spared no pains 
in obtaining from life the likenesses of those 
characters who had a conspicuous part in 
our revolution." 



From country to country he pursued his 
subjects. Each person who sat for him, Trumbull 
persuaded to recall the events in which he or she 
starred, thus annotating his version of these 
moments. Remembering how Washington 
recalled the Battle of Trenton as he posed, 
Trumbull wrote in his A.utobWgraphy. "He looked 
the scene again, and I happily tranSferred it ro 
canvas, the lofty expression of his animated 
countenance, the high resolve to oonquer or ro 
perish." 



For Trumbull, the same lofty expression 
crossed his animated countenance as he 
painted. Fame would be his, he insisted. Hel 
would be the painter of the American 
Revolution.

hose eminent patriots, would futurt 
generations

their

gallery rising before his eyes, the Colond 
had reason for concern. To Trumbull's great 
distress, the American Revolution had 
ceased to fascinate the public by the time be 
finished casting about for portraits co 
complete his historical series. Ne\1' 
revolutions in France had stifled memorid 
of events now almost a half-century pas! 
The result had been a financial disaster. 
Faced with growing debts, Trumbu1 
confined himself to his studio, bitte 
despondent. Younger artists seemed to ste.

originals. Humidity necessitated temporary 
removal of the huge canvases; bur few in the 
rapidly expanding democracy much 
concerned themselves with how to enshrine 
the past. 



Hoping to secure his legacy, Trumbull 
set about to find a home for what remained 
in his possession, the history series 
originals-the paintings that had traversed 
the globe with Trumbull, seeking a cast of 
characters. He sensed a sympathetic soul in 
his nephew-in-law, Benjamin Silliman, Yale 
professor of chemistry, whom he regaled 
with tales of his woes and made an offer of 
his paintings. Silliman and then Yale 
College President Jeremiah Day could not 
refuse. Yale committed to a $1,000 per year 
pension for the debt-ridden painter. Failure 
to pay it, Trumbull threatened, would 
prompt him to transfer the works to his 
alma mater Harvard. Trumbull moved in 
with the Sillimans and designed a neo-
classical gallery to house his collection. 



And now that he claimed the title of 
oldest surviving Revolutionary headquarters 
officer, he could afford to saunter over to 
watch the gallery construction, confident 
that Yale students would point when his 
erect figure swept by and say, "There goes 
DECEMBER 2, 1994 
old 
Colonel." 



Touching up The Battle 
of Bunker's Hill for the 
new gallery, Trumbull 
resigned himself to face 
the shape of groaning 
death-tinged 
in 
whatever colors-when 
it came for him. Leaning 
on his maulstick-a 
convenient arm-rest for 
the aged painter-much 
as Washington leaned on 
his walking stick in one 
of his portraits, Colonel 
Trumbull felt confident 
of his own place in 
history. This gallery 
would guarantee that. 
No matter what they 
said about his painting, 
future 
would not be able to 
remember Bunker's Hill 
without turning towards his paintings 
tucked in the little gallery. In spite of them 
aJI, he had become the Patriot-Artist, the 
painter of the American Revolution.

C
reaking shovels scraped against the 
ust-uncovered brick tomb. Steady, 
now. Raise the mahogany coffin 
slowly. The old Colonel Trumbull did not 
appreciate disturbing. Kneeling down for a 
better view, Theodore Sizer-recenrly 
appointed associate director of the Yale 
Gallery of Fine Arrs, inspected the coffin's 
shape. Were those bones he glimpsed 
through a crack? He quickly turned away. 
The grave had been long in the finding: 
no one had thought to note down irs exact 
position for posterity. Berween Vanderbilt 
HaJI and Street Hall (built in 1866 to house 
Yale's growing art collection), they had 
excavated a huge hole without much success 
in finding the bodies of Trumbull and his 
wife. Then someone suggested they try 
inside. Sizer supervised, as the "little 
company" abandoned the exposed hole and 
retreated into the basement of the building. 



Ha!-As he surveyed the solemn parade 
of dignitaries, Sizer suppressed a grin under 
his black mustache and felt fedora. The old 
Colonel had them yet. Digging for the 
Colonel was a ceremony that absolutely had 
to be fulfilled before the college art 
collections could be transferred from the 
Street Hall building to the new museum 
being constructed across High Street. Sizer 
loved the stares as he led his audience along 
the path to TrumbuiJ's bones. It all stemmed 
back to a troublesome promise John 
Trumbull had exacted from Benjamin 
Silliman and Jeremiah Day when the 
historical pictures were installed at Yale in 
the little neo-classical gallery that once stood 
on the Old Campus. 



A connoisseur of tales, Sizer never 
missed a chance to recount this bizarre 
encounter. "The tragedy of the bilingual, 
one-eyed soldier-turned-painter was that 
most of his good work was produced before 
he was forty and he lived to be eighty-
eight." Sizer spoke, as he wrote, in 
flourishes. After finding his art a final resting 
place at Yale, Trumbull ensured one for 
himself and his wife. "It is my wish," 
Trumbull told Silliman, "to be interred 
beneath this Gallery ... these pictures are my 
children-those whom they represent have 
all gone before me." Part of the agreement 
drawn up by the college required that the 
bodies of Trumbull and his wife be buried 
beneath the gaJlery. 



"Some centuries hence," Sizer quoted 
from Silliman's journal, "when the firm 
scones of the Trumbull Gallery have fallen, 
those who dig among the ruins will discover 
the tomb in the obscure crypt and will be 
warned not to violate it when they read the: 
inscription." 



But the Colonel trusted the succeeding 
generations less than his nephew-in-law 
Silliman. Remembering the: blows the: 
younger painters had dealt his reputation, he: 
inserted a clause in the agreement 
forbidding that his or his wife's bodies be 
moved from underneath the 92Y.z by 63 
inch portrait of George Washington at 
Trenton. 



And the: old Colonel's suspicions, Sizer 
explained to the assembled company, had
