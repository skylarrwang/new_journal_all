D 
on't expect any help getting there. It 
might be possible to stumble 
unawares 
upon 
Trumbull's 
paintings, but it rakes a keen detective to 
locate the other items he left to Yale, namely 
his bones and those of his wife Sarah. 

Bidding farewell to Washington and the rest, 
make sure to maintain a good sense of place 
while tripping down the stairway. Don't 
forget: Trumbull insisted that his bones lie 
directly beneath the 92~ by 63 inch portrait 
of beckoning George Washington at Trenton. 

The first piece of burial evidence: a 
sunken slab in the floor of the Grear 
Sculpture Hall of the older section of the 
gallery. The Sculpture Hall itself, though, 
appears unused, almost forgotten, certainly 
devoid of the wellspring of tourists 
inhabiting the newer wing. 

Bur discovering the slab does not mean 
reaching the final resting place. Don't be 
discouraged by the unfriendly guards-they 
have to remain silent for security reasons. 
Bur security or not, the evidence continues 
to surface: a stairway leads below. Check 
that no one is watching, and then plunge 
into the basement. The same Continental 
blue and faded-breeches yellow that painted 
Washington's military uniform adorns 
cobwebbed corridors. The Colonel would 
have appreciated that. Sir.ens have not yet 
sounded: relax and peer through the dusty 
haze. 

In one glass display case, a sarcophagus 
is ... No, it's empty. The bodies lie beyond. 
The only remnant: on one wall hangs what 
Sizer claimed was the original 1843 grave 
plaque. Two doors stand' on either side as 
sentinels. One smells of Trumbull Gallery 
pine. A minuscule key hole entices-and it 
has been too long a pilgrimage to resist 
temptation. Kneel down and squint within. 

If few visitors reach the far-off room where 
the Trumbull paintings lurk, much less find 
the black memorial slab-still, have faith: 
bones and galleries do not confine a Patriot-
Artist. As Trumbull hunted for portraits 
during his own life, as Sizer hunted 
paintings in his, their spirits now forever 
scour the Yale air for successors. George 
Washington beckons ... Trumbull guides his 
hand ... Sizer picks up the maulscick. Who's 
next? Step into history.
