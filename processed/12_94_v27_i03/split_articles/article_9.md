EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Being a news and features magazine with a healthy lead time between issues offers unique complications-like the fear of being scooped-.but the format's flexibility make everything worth it. We value, above all else, the ability to cover more than just the stories of the hour. This sometimes means breaking the "let sleeping dogs lie" rule: stories that could have gone unnoticed can spring to life in unexpected ways as eye-opening articles for our readers. 

Occasionally, TN] stories also hatch into minor obsessions for our writers. Robin Kemper has been haunting the Drama School for the past couple of months; Dan Murphy playe~ numerous rounds of phone tag with occult oncologist Bernie Siegel (and his guardian angel George); Kate Schuler's article about the Farmington Canal had hei- traipsing through tunnels under the abandoned railway at strange hours; and Ann Sledge, desperate for the latest information on the Yale Homebuyer Program, besieged her sources' voicemail for weeks on end. 

Josh Civin's article about John Tr~mbull wins this issue's prize for reportorial persistence bordering on the pathological-but then again, the· strange adventures of the patriot-artist seem to inspire uncommon intensity. From the Battle of Bunker's Hill to London art studios to his (somewhat) final resting place beneath the Yale Art Gallery, Trumbull's little-known story begs to be told. To untangle the story behind Trumbull's life, death, and multiple burials,· Civin pored over the manuscripts of Theodore Sizer, a Yale art professor who devoted much of his scholarly career to caquoguing Trumbull's work. He credits much of the story's rich detail to his conversations with Caroline Rollins, Sizer's assistant in this project at the time of his death in 1967. Civin's superimposition of the art historian's work on the painter's creations provided a structure for the piece-with apologies to Simon Schama. (Schama's recent book Dead Certainties seeks to unravel the complicated relationship between painter Benjamin West and an art historian studying his work.) 

Civin recreates the Revolution as it would have looked through the eyes of Trumbull-and Trumbull as he would have appeared to Sizer. Although Civin's article treads the line between history and historical fiction, we believe his extensive research has kept him firmly grounded in the available facts. His journey to the bowels of the Art Gallery to make rubbings of Trumbull's tombstone for the cover may mark the end of his year-long obsession with the old colonel. At least we can hope.
