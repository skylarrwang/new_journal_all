As groups of soph omores attempt t o resurrect the old Yale instit ution of the 
Fence Club, ' 90s Yalies may cry ... 
Don't Fence Me In 
W
en the Fence Club closed in 1979 the New York 
Timt'i ran an article tided "The Passing of a Club for 
he Elite at Yale." The piece described the club as "a 
astion of privilege, where a man of means could go 
for a good meal, to shoot some pool or have a quiet drink with a few 
college buddies." The description of the club evokes an antiquated 
vision of Yale, when it was overwhelmingly homogeneous and before 
women had been admitted. Last spring a number of then-freshmen 
began contemplating the notion of resurrecting the club. 

Nathaniel Fogg (BK '97) had grown up hearing about the Fence 
Club from his father, Joseph G. Fogg III (BK '68), and his father's 
friends, who had belonged to the club in their Yale days. 

The "Fence" of old retained much of its campus renown eveQ 
after its closing. The original building, which still stands off of York 
Street, has been used by student organizations in recent years for 
informal parties. In its heyday, the Fence building contained a bar, 
large dining room, ballroom, billiard room, and a stage. 

nitially, Fogg and a few of his friends began to talk about the idea 
of finding a place of retreat. They envisioned a house off-
campus: a place to enjoy an afternoon snack, watch television, 
and hang out with friends. Throughout the summer and this fall, 
their vision has evolved into a new Fence Club. However, the 
utopian vision of the society they wished to create contrasted with 
what many would consider a legitimate purpose for forming the 
group. They lacked a unifying principle or cause for which to fight. 
Fogg and his friends sought only to get a house. 

The Fence Club began as Psi Upsilon, a junior fraternity formed 
in 1839. In 1934 it became the Fence Club, named for the fence 
surrounding the Old Campus which was once a social hangout. The 
fence was more than a gathering place--it also operated as a site of 
social conflict; social cliques and classes claimed their own sections of 
the fence. 

could not transfer meals to different residential colleges, so the club 
allowed students from different colleges to eat together. Fence's 
popularity peaked in the mid 1960s, with as many as 150 members. 
It served as a sponsor for social functions, a place of retreat, and as 
Fogg recalls his father saying, a place to "cement friendships." In the 
late 1960s Fence even had a surplus of $120,000 from bar revenues, 
according to the New York Times.

Yale changed in the 1970s, following a national trend against the 
establishment and tradition. Fence lost its attraction. Yale began to 
emphasize residential college life and accepted female students in 
1969. In that year the Yale Banner described fraternities as "benign 
irrelevancies." In 1972 6KE closed, and Fence was left with a mere 
20 members. 

Although Fence had a few major drives to increase membership 
in the late 1970s and accepted female members in 1972, it never 
again attracted the numbers or the dues needed to cover expenses. In 
1979, with a debt of $26,700, Fence closed its doors and turned the 
building over to Â·the university. Fence had no place in contemporary 
Yale. "The profile of the undergraduate body seemed to have 
permanently shifted, and there simply was not enough demand for 
the fraternities to keep them operating," noted Joseph Fogg III. 

Fence's imminent resurrection raises questions about what role it 
could fill at Yale in the 1990s. Over the last decade Yale has become 
increasingly diverse, with the highest percentage of female 
undergraduates of any Ivy and a vocal minority population. The 
Fence chose to break its affiliation with the national Psi Upsilon 
organization and, like most of the junior fraternities on campus, set 
up a foundation. The Trumbull Trust Fund, regulated by a small 
group of Fence alumni, supported the society's activities. In the 
1960s, Yale had two major fraternities-Delta Kappa Epsilon (6KE), 
which attracted the so-called jocks, and Fence, 
home of the "preppies." Members dined several 
b 
times a week at the house. At that time students 
Fence of old hardly seems appropriate in today's 
sening. 

While most students at Yale do not identify with
