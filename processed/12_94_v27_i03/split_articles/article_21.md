Won't You Be Our Neighbor? 
President levin's bold new homebuyer program lures Yale employees to New 
Haven, but will it be enough to make them stay? 
P
rofessors, administrators, clerical and maintenance workers: if 
you are a Yale employee, you may be eligible for this one-time 
offer. All you have to do is buy a house in New Haven, and 
we'll give you $2,000 a year for the next ten years-no strings 
attached! But don't delay: offer expires January 1996. 
Essentially, President Levin made such a pitch when he ' 
announced Yale's New Haven Homebuyer Program on April 20, 
1994. So far, 79 employees have taken the President up on his offer. 
An accountant for 15 years in the medical school's department of 
neurology, Diane Steel had never before considered moving to New 
Haven, but the program allowed her to buy the perfect-sized house in 
a "nice" neighborhood. The incentive fit perfectly into Diane 
Robinson's plans. She had already applied for a mortgage for a· new 
house in New Haven when she discovered that her status as a 
university library service assistant entitled her to an unexpected 
benefit. The Homebuyer Program also turned administrative assistanr 
Brenda Carr from a tenant on Lawrence 
Street into a Fairhaven home owner. For 
dermatology administrator Jill Schneider, 
living close to work and downtown 
attractions opened up a whole new set of 
opportunities. 

Now that the program has been in 
place for over eight months, the stories of 
its beneficiaries do not fully mesh with 
Yale's original vision. When President 
Levin first spoke about the Homebuyer 
Program, he claimed that it would 
benefit both Yale employees and various 
New Haven communities and would 
further improve town-gown relations. 
"This is the first time that any Yale 
benefit program has been directed 
especially to employees residing in New 
Haven," he said. "We hope it will attract 
additional residents to the city who will 
be active in their neighborhoods and 
who will, of course, contribute as 
not necessarily ingredients for ensuring that these citizens become 
active neighbors. T he program projects an important image: it shows 
the university's commitment to providing employees with bonuses, 
and to involving them in the community; however, these noble goals 
threaten to generate an empty symbol- a program that does not 
actually effect any monumental change in Yale-New Haven relations. 

Sociology professor Paul Johnston stressed that in order to bridge the 
Yale-New Haven gap effectively, Yale employees who apply for home-
buying incentives should not simply move to New Haven but should 
invest in their new communities as well. 

Image is fundamental to selling homes. Barbara Pearce, director of 
a local realty company, stressed that the H omebuyer Program 
encourages people from outside the area who work at Yale to live in 
the city. "[The incentive] sends out the message that Yale cares where 
they live," she explained. The plan's popularity has increased as this 
message has spread. Everyone seems to be praising the program for its 
originality and the way it ties together 
benefits for Yale employees with benefits 
for New Haven. O ne employee, thankful 
fo r Yale's increased involvement in 
improving employee standards of living, 
admitted: "I really didn't think Yale cared 
about its employees that much." 

W:
ile the program seems to 
ccomplish a great deal, each 
f its benefits includes some 
sort of catch. Michael Boyle, Chief 
Steward for Local Unions 34 and 35, 
pointed out that the program may not 
target one group of people it is 
supposedly intended to help--namely, ] 
less wealthy employees who are first-time ~ 
or lower-cost home buyers. According to 
~ 
a press release, a University Task Force ::; 
convened by University Secretary Linda t: 
c: 
Lorimer chose the $2,000 flat-rate 
incentive because it intended to support ., 
lower-cost home buyers more. Proportio nally, 
c 
caxpayers and customers ro the economic health of 
the city." The program has brought new residents to 
New Haven, but a new house and the incentive are 
$2,000 comprises a larger fraction of the cost of a :r 
$50,000 house than that of a $150,000 house. -'

Furthermore, lower-cost home buyers are 
more likely to need an extra infusion of cash 
than wealthier buyers. The Yale Daily News 
reported last April that President Levin did 
not necessarily intend the program to 
relocate Yale families already seeded in the 
suburbs. Instead, Levin hoped to appeal to 
first-time home buyers, who tend to purchase 
in a lower price bracket. 

Despite the task force and Levin's 
intentions, statistics compiled by rhe 
Secretary's Office present a different story. 
Only nine participants bought real estate 
valued under $50,000, whereas 22 people 
bought houses worth over $150,000. 
Moreover, only 30 clerical, technical, service 
and maintenance employees received 
benefits, whereas 49 faculty and management 
professionals rook advantage of the incentive. 
This discrepancy stems from a restriction 
hidden in the text of the initiative. The 
program applies only to employees who work 
20 hours or more per week for the university. 
Since custodial workers typically bold 17-
hour weekly jobs, they remain ineligible for 
the program, though many of these workers 
actually do work for Yale far more than 20 
hours per week on a temporary basis. Chief 
Steward Boyle stressed the important role 
such incentives could play for these workers, 
most of whom now live in New Haven as 
tenams. The Homebuyer Program would 
allow them to purchase the homes in which 
they already live. Extending the program to 
these additional workers would provide 
much-needed stability to economically-
disadvamaged areas including Newhallville, 
the Hill, and Dixwell neighborhoods, where

demographic maps show a concentration of 
service .and maintenance employees. As a 
result, perhaps the program would come 
closer to reaching one of the goals outlined 
by the University Task Force and President 
Levin: to benefic lower-cost home buyers. 

The current beneficiaries, though, come 
from the opposite end . of the income 
spectrum. Realtors rema~k that the program 
has affected wealthier home buyers who are 
looking at houses in areas on the edge of the 
city, such as the St. Ronan-Edgehill Road 
neighborhood, which spans New Haven and 
Hamden. According to Barbara Pearce, the 
incentive "makes people feel good about 
choosing" houses on the New Haven side of 
these areas, despite the much higher property 
tax on city housing. With the added 
monetary incentive, higher properry taxes 
become less of a deterrent. 

leviating property taxes in itself 
roves one of the program's biggest 
enefits. 

Before her move, 
university accountant Diane Steel lived in a 
West Haven condominium with her 
husband and two children. The family 
decided that their living space was too 
small, and Steel looked for a new house in 
the Hamden and North Haven area for 
about a year. Steel did not even consider 
moving to New Haven until she heard 
about the incentive. "I didn't want to live in 
New Haven; I really didn't," she declared. 
She explained that the incentive allows her 
to live in one of what she calls New Haven's 
"nicer areas," in a comfortable ten-room 
house, and afford the property tax. Her tax 
is, in effect, lowered from $3,600 to $1,600. 

Since most of the participants reinvest 
their incentive money in the city through 
property tax payments, the Homebuyer 
Program becomes another one of Yale's 
indirect subsidies co New Haven. One 
professor argued that the incentives could 
substitute for Yale's failure co pay fully irs own 
property _taxes. Currently, Yale does not pay 
taxes on most of its property, though 
Connecticut reimburses New Haven for a 
percentage of the income lost. 

The program should help New Haven's 
slumped real estate market by attracting more 
customers. Would as many Yale employees 
have moved to New Haven regardless of the 
program? Eighteen participants closed on 
their houses in August. Many closings 
occurred in May, June, and July as well. These 
figures are rypical, since the summer is always 
a popular time to buy a house. 

Although information on how many 
faculty and staff moved co New Haven during 
previous summers is not available for 
comparison, realtors claim they have seen an 
increase in New Haven sales since the 
incentive plan went into effect. Pearce said 
that last summer three people connected to 
Yale placed bids on a New Haven house that 
had been on the marker for two years. Yet 
some of the 79 participants would have 
bought houses in New Haven even without 
the incentive. Robinson had already applied 
for a mortgage when she found out about the 
program, so the extra $2,000 did not 
influence her decision to move.

encouraging as much employee involvement 
in the city as possible. Program participants, 
now new urban citizens, do not necessarily 
invest in facets of New Haven communities 
other than real estate. Fully involving Yale 
employees in long-term commitments co 
New Haven will necessitate university 
contribution to a more inclusive concept of 
city life chat includes improvements in 
public transportation and public education. 

Pearce and program participant Jill 
Schneider both mentioned that the 
Homebuyer Program could be expanded 
through public transportation subsidies. 
Pearce pointed out that people living in the 
city are more likely to ride the Yale Shuttle 
Bus. This change in commuting patterns 
frees up parking spaces and cuts down on 
pollution from fuel exhaust. Schneider 
strongly advocates implementing additional 
Yale programs to encourage employee 
involvement in New Haven. She stated, 
"The more you link Yale and New Haven, 
the more support each side will have from 
the other." 

Going further, Boyle suggests chat Yale 
extend the Homebuyer Program co include 
pan-time workers and people already living 
in New Haven. As a result, Yale employees 
might decide to remain in the city rather 
than move to the suburbs after the ten years 
have elapsed. Boyle cites a program at 
Stanford University as an example of 
providing enhanced benefits for people 
purchasing 
homes 
in 
less 
stable 
neighborhoods. Thus, the program could 
FAO.i '-tY 
effectively target those New Haven 
communities most in need of citizen 
involvement. 

Yale employees with children might be 
encouraged to stay in the city if improved 
educational opportunities became available. 
Pearce suggests that Yale provide private 
school vouchers for all children of 
Homebuyer Program participants. Professor 
Johnston refused to go as far in abandoning 
public education. He felt that Yale should 
review the kind of support families and 
educational institutions need in order for 
Yale employees to feel comfortable about 
sending their children to public school in 
New Haven. Johnston explained chat such 
actions constitute an important way for Yale 
employees to invest themselves in the 
community. 

Overall, the Homebuyer Program is a 
"good starr, a good piece of the puzzle," as 
Schneider stated. The intentions Yale 
advertised as part of the program are 
admirable: to increase Yale employee benefits 
and participation in the community. 
However, co benefit New Haven, these 
citizens must become loyal to their new 
communities, and invest more in the city 
where they live and work. Making New 
Haven more attractive to employees who 
already live in the city, and retaining chose 
newly-arrived, is just as important as 
attracting additional citizens.
