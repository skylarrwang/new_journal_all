Trailing Behind 
T
he New Haven region stands ready to take advantage of 
innovations in American park design that promise to 
benefit urban communities. G rassroots efforts to 
transform the Farmington Canal, an abandoned railway, 
into a linear park greenway have been gaining momentum in New 
by Yale and downtown. 
Grassroots effom usually drive such "rails to trails" movements 
as they evolve with little leadership from government or parks 
officials. The Farmington Canal Rail to Trail Association (FCRTA) 
began in 1987 when a group of citizens in Hamden organized to 
oppose a plan to build a shopping mall in the town. They

quiet controversy surrounds the 
Farmington Canal project and 
questions remain about the 
extensive planning involved in 
developing a park running 
through both Connecticut's 
richest suburbs and poorest 
inner-ciry neighborhoods in New 
H aven. Questions persist because 
the city seems to be blindly

discovered that the proposed site 
for the mall rested on old railroad 
tracks, the Hamden portion of the 
old Farmingron Canal line. Nancy 
Alderman (FOR '98), member of 
. the group rallying against the 
shopping mall, current president 
of FCRTA, and now a first-year 
forestry student, believed that the 
possible historical significance of 
the railway could help stop the 
construction of the mall. She

federal government, yet the process of assessing the feasibiliry of the 
project and drawing up a plan has not begun. 
Planners wane to build the greenway on the site of the old 
Farmington Canal and rail bed, which runs 83 miles from New 
Haven to Northampton, Massachusetts. The canal, which opened 
in 1829, was transformed into a railroad in 1848. When floods 
irreparably damaged the tracks in 1982, the railway was 
abandoned. The path intersects New Haven for three miles, 
running from Cheshire to Hamden into Dixwell, Newhallville, 
Science Park, Yale (through Prospect, Hillhouse, and Church 
Streets), and down to the Audobon Arts Block and New Haven 
Harbor. 
The greenway concept has emerged in the last ten years as a 
response to both continued suburban sprawl and increased 
abandonment of railroad beds. The greenway aims to connect the 
suburbs and inner ciry neighborhoods with the resources and jobs 
concentrated in the central downtown area. In the New Haven 
area, the greenway would provide residents from the suburbs of 
H amden and Cheshire and from

sought help from the newly 
formed National Rails to Trails 
Conservancy, whose lawyer, Charles Montagne, helped sue the 
Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) for allowing the illegal 
abandonment of the railroad. A federal law required the ICC to 
offer the land to the Department of Transportation and the 
Department of Environmental Protection. After these agencies 
passed up the offer, the tract went to the governments of each town 
the trail ran through. FCRTA worked to lobby the city 
governments of Hamden and New Haven to convert t.he railway 
into a recreation trail. 
FCRTA made little headway on the trail project under the 
administrations of Mayors Biagio DiLieto and John Daniels. Mayor 
John DeStefano has supported the trail project by working with the 
Trust for Public Land to purchase the land from developers who 
acquired it during the DiLieto administration. The ciry finally 
purchased the canal land in December of 1993, with the intention 
of building the trail. City officials have begun work on a grant 
proposal co obtain federal funding for the construction of the trail, 
but FCTRA paved the way for the ciry to act and has no intention 
of relinquishing control of the project.

sector involvement may be the only way for many parks to thrive. 
Diana Balmori, Yale professor of architecture and principal designer 
for Balmori Associates, points out in her essay "Park Redefinitions" 
that, "Whoever pays the bill makes the decisions-aesthetic 
choices, programming, and use hours are then determined by a 
group of like-minded individuals, often from the same 
socioeconomic group, whose vision narrowly defines the life in 
common; with this limitation, public space becomes less public." A 
glance at the list of the board members on FCRTA, who oversee the 
portion of the trail passing through New Haven County, shows that 
of the 22 members, seven reside in New Haven. The others come 
from the suburbs-exclusive areas in Woodbridge, Hamden, and 
North Haven. Since FCRTA has been the main lobbying and 
fundraising force, it will be its board's money and ideas that will 
shape the trail. 
FCRTA's brochure clearly spells out its utopian vision of "biking 
or hiking along a historic canal line, safely tucked away from traffic, 
passing through city and suburban neighborhoods, over old stone 
arch bridges. 
Considering the diversity of the areas the trail will run through, 
this vision seems unrealistic and na"ive. As FCRTA focuses its 
energies on implementing the linear park, it fails to address many of 
the issues that come with urban environments, such as safety. 
Members argue that increased traffic along the canal will force illicit 
activities to other areas. 
Tatum Nolan (DC '97), a trail proponent, researched studies 
that show crime rates have not significantly changed in areas where 
greenways were built. He cites repons by the Department of the 
Interior and the State Trail Planner of Colorado that show crime 
either decreases in areas with trails or remains steady. However, 
Nolan said the Farmington Canal "is unique because it joins poor 
neighborhoods to very wealthy neighborhoods. All of the reports 
done so far are for suburban trails." A study done by the Trust for 
Public Land (TPL) offers statistics that show that recreation areas 
can deter crime. The report reveals that "crime plummeted 90 
percent in a Philadelphia precinct after police helped volunteers 
clean up vacant lots and plant gardens" and "juvenile arrests 
Vitw of Canal at cormr of Prosptct and Trumbull Struts 
DECEMBER 2, 1994 
declined by almost one-third in Fort Myers, FL, after the city began 
a youth academics and recreation p.rogram." In the TPL study the 
implementation of these recreational areas included specific 
programs and distinct efforts by the cities to reduce crime. Open 
space alone will not reduce crime. From their experience with 
urban parks, such as the New Haven Green, some would say that 
open space would make things only more dangerous. 
FCRTA's vision for the greenway diverges from city residents' 
vision for the trail's use. Alderman calls the accessibility to the Arts 
Block on Audobon Street from Dixwell and Newhall ville one of the 
biggest advantages of the greenway. Yet a series of concerts and 
sculpture events targeted toward these neighborhoods drew few 
residents from those areas, said Sharon Hausam (FOR '95), one of 
the organizers of the projects. This could indicate that using the 
canal land as a place for arts and cultural activities is not a high 
priority. 
Forestry students interviewed many Dixwell residents and 
found them to be "apathetic" about the greenway project. Many 
residents viewed the project as an idea imposed upon them by 
outsiders. Those who were aware of it often "belittled it by labeling 
it the 'jogging track' or 'bike path."' Most residents expressed 
interest, but many mentioned a need for types of recreation 
facilities other than a greenway. Instead of a bike path, one man 
suggested building basketball courts or installing swings. 
Others concerned with improving general living conditions 
suggested using the land for purposes other than a park-building 
housing, homeless shelters, or stores. One resident said, "Housing, 
we need more housing ... on second thought ... put stores there. We 
need grocery stores for people." 
Residents bring up over and over issues of safety and policing 
along the trail. Hausam said, "Safety is a major, major concern for 
Dixwell residents." Another resident of Dixwell, who works at 
Dixwell/Newhallville Menral Health and Family Services, says, 
"We don't need submerged parks. It would really be a recipe for 
muggings, for disaster. You would be making it easier to commit a 
crime. There would be muggings a mile long." 
A police officer at the Newhallville substation told the forestry


potential use of the canal as a shortcut to 
the "mudhole," a noted gathering place for 
gangs and drug dealers. He also stressed 
that the canal is an easy way for suspects to 
flee from police and that robberies might 
increase when the path is cleared of debris. 
An architectural plan for the canal 
developed by Balmori Associates includes a 
proposal for the trail that lies somewhere 
berween the vision of the FCRTA and the 
expressed needs of the Dixwell and 
Newliallville residents. Balmori's idea for 
the park transcends the somewhat limited 
vision of FCRTA, yet it still does not offer 
satisfactory plans for all of the park. A 
statement in the plan for the canal 
addresses many of the issues of building 
the greenway. In this original design plan, 
Balmori wrote, "The needs, concerns, 
development plans, and individual 
character of each section of, and 
neighborhood along, the canal corridor 
must be recognized and incorporated into 
the project" in order for the greenway to be 
effective as a continuous whole. 
Such ideological visions translate into 
policy with difficulty. Indeed, the proposal 
features specific plans for the cultural 
opportunities the trail will provide-the 
Yale Collection of Musical Instruments, 
the Arts Council Building, antique fairs, a 
proposal to build a museum of industrial 
technology, and mile markers stating the 
historical significance of each area the canal 
passes through. Running a light rail train 
through the canal was another idea 
presented by Balmori. 
Specific issues such as safety, however, 
have received only vague coverage in the
30 
Balmori plan. Balmori's notion of safety 
differs from the Dixwell residents' ideas. 
Alan Planus, Yale professor of architecture 
ancl a consultant on the initial Balmori 
plan, dismisses the possibility of criminals 
using the canal as an escape route. "Drug 
dealers are more sophisticated than that-
they have cars." The design plan focuses on 
preventing cars from accessing the trail, 
while allowing emergency vehicles to pass 
through. 
· 
Balmori suggests, "The best policy is 
patrolling by policemen on bikes, and 
closing 
the 
park 
at 
dark ... also 
neighborhood watch associations along the 
linear park." Her suggestions conjure up an 
unfathomable image for some. With city 
resources already strapped, the prospect of 
police officers patrolling the trail on 
bicycles appears unrealistic. 
Balmori also maintains that increased 
traffic on the trail would decrease crime 
activity in the area. Balmori said, "The 
work done by the Rails to Trails 
[Conservancy] in Washington, D.C., which 
has looked at many trails recently done, 
shows that heavy use by bikes and 
pedestrians makes places which have 
undesirable activities too visible and they 
tend to move away." 
Since the 1988 plan by Balmori 
Associates, Balmori, along with forestry and 
environmental studies professor William 
Burch, has worked with srudencs from the 
School of Forestry to develop a more 
comprehensive plan for the Farmington 
Canal. The students' work reveals a 
concern that any plan for the canal needs to 
recognize the unique problems that 
accompany building a park through urban 
communities. Hausam said, "[Balmori] is a 
firm believer in the idea that if we don't get 
the community involved, [the trail] won't 
happen." Using census data, personal 
interviews, and walking observations, the 
students assessed the canal neighborhoods. 
The students' report, "Farmington 
Canal Community Needs and Constraints 
Assessment," found the main concerns of 
residents in the urban neighborhoods 
focused on issues of security, maintenance, 
and feasibility (money and community 
support). The formula- necessary to make a 
successful trail in Dixwell and Newhallville 
is ambitious and complex. The report 
"Strategies for Management of the 
Farmington Canal Greenway," which 
makes recommendations for developing the 
canal, begins with the ominous statement, 
"Any attempt to transform this section of 
the canal into a greenway must be linked to 
the redevelopment of the parcels of land 
surrounding the canal. If the greenway were 
built today, the lack of people living and 
working in the immediate viciniry would 
make it a dangerous, and thus seldom used, 
area." The students then call for "urban 
renewal programs." Broad-based urban 
renewal programs carry large expenses and 
have generally been unsuccessful in the 
past. The efforts of the Forestry School 
provide no means to support all of the 
programs they suggest. There is no plan for 
the "urban renewal" that they demand for 
the Dixwell and Newhallville portions of 
the canal. 
Largely theoretical, the recom-
mendations do not sufficiently acknow-
ledge the complexities that would be 
involved 
in 
urban 
renewal. 
The 
recommendation for the mudhole area of 
Newhallville, perhaps the biggest cause for 
concern, is especially vague. "The mudhole 
provides a unique challenge for the 
greenway. With proper design and 
consideration, the greenway can restructure 
the area encompassing the mudhole and 
reclaim this area for the citizens of 
Newhallville. The greenway, therefore, will 
not only overcome a design obstacle, but 
will also resolve a lingering problem for the 
city."
