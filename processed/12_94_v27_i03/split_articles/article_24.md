Medical Miracles 
Dr. Bernie Siegal heads the movement in medicine to do more than just fix 
bodies; he strives to heal-through the combination of body and mind . 
'' 
B
ernie 
Siegel?" 
says 
Roseanne behind the counter at 
Atticus Books on Chapel 
Street. "His books just 
Ay off the shelves." 

The only thing that moves faster 
than Bernie Siegel's books is Bernie 
Siegel himself. At 63, the former 
Yale professor of surgery, best-
selling author, and self-help 
therapist has just competed 
in his third marathon. 

Siegel also just happens 
to have a guardian angel 
named George. Siegel 
believes in the healing 
power of the color purple 
and shaves his head bald to 
uncover what he calls his 
"emotions, spirituality, and 
love." His car bears vanity license 
plates proclaiming "MD-LOVE." 

Siegel once told the supermarket 
tabloid Tht Midnight Globt that the 
mind can cure cancer. Perhaps Bobbie, 
Siegel's wife of thirty years described him best 
when she told Ptopk magazine, "He's always been 
different." 

Even with all of his personal quirks, Siegel would 
likely still be a relatively obscure New Haven surgeon, 
teaching surgery at Yale, if not for his radical 
psychoneuroimmunological ideas about cancer. At a 
time when soaring health care costs have necessitated 
radjcal reform in medicine, Siegel presents a return to the 
cost-effective laying on of hands. As the technology of 
standard medical practice expands, Siegel stands on the 
scientific fringe. Mainsrream medicine appears reluctant 
to embrace a man who places miracles above machines. 

Siegel has not always trusted in the power of 
miracles. Beginning in 1960, he held a New Haven 
by Dan Murphy 
surgery practice with Dr. Rjchard Selzer, whom he 
met while a surgical resident at Yale. But what would 
appear like success to many fell far shore for 
Siegel. "I felt like a failure," he writes in his 
1986 book Lovt, Mtdicint and Miraclts. 

He saw himself as a mechanic trying 
merely to fix people, and when he 
failed, it left him in a state of despair. 

Lovt, Medicint, and Miraclts cites a 
journal entry from the mid 70s: "I 
operate on person after person 
and I can't cure them. What 
good can I do anyone?" 

Two separate sets of 
changes brought Siegel out of 
this state, altering his life 
forever. The first changes 
came gradually. He shaved his 
head for the first time. He 
moved his desk against the 
wall so he could sit closer to his 
patients. He encouraged his 
patients to call him Berrue instead 
of Dr. Siegel. He extended his new 
warmth to fellow physicians, medical 
students, and residents. "He was 
personally warm 
a nd delightful," 
remembers Dr. Barbara Ward, assistant 
professor of oncology at the Yale School of ;; 
Medicine, who worked with Siegel during her 
residency at Yale. "He was always listening to the Â£. 
patients and the residents." Ward recalls an 
z 
occasion when Siegel drew a rainbow on her name. ., 
.s::. 
"That sort of thing was typical of him," she notes.

Yet even after this personal transformation, Siegel E 
still felt something lackjng in his practice. He was still 
seekjng answers in 1978 when he attended a workshop } 
entitled "Psychological Factors, Stress, and Cancer." l> 
During one of the workshop's gujded meditations, ~ 
Siegel first encountered his guardian angel George, 
whom he describes in his fll'St book as "a bearded, 
long-haired young man wearing an immaculate
