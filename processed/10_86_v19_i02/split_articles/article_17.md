EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Slim, but not too 
slim, titled in bold 
black and red letters, 
it projects a crisply· 
professional image. 
but next year I will be out on my own 
and I will finally have. the chance to 
make my life turn out the way I plan 
it." 

After reading this emotionally raw 
essay- which, 
incidentally, 
might 
make a straight A + student seem 
more human but might be taken as an 
excuse for failure had it come from a 
student with low grades and test 
scores- it is almost embarrassing to 
flip to the book's introduction and read 
Kasbar's and Curry's advice on how to 
appeal 
to an ·admissions 
officer: 
•Admissions officers are very human. 
They will laugh at a funny joke, and 
they will get excited over a well-written 
account of a close game. They may 
even shed a tear if you pull them 
through 
a 
tragedy." The advice 
continues: "Admissions officers will 
become bored and irritated as quickly 
as anyone by essays that are dull and 
blatantly self-serving." 

Some of the essays don't need 
Kasbar's and Curry's advice because 
they're already skillful illustrations of 
students selling themselves. 
One 
ingratiating student writes a poem 
entitled The Admissions Officer "in honor 
of the most dedicated college official." 
He begins: "It is now 3 a.m./and his 
eyes 
are getting glassy ./He sifts 
through wads of paper/watching 
reruns of Star Trek and Lassie." After 
lamenting the trials and tribulations of 
•a hard-working, brilliant mind," the 
final verse reads: "This was a tribute to 
the little man/the man whose brain 
IDust feel like lead,II hope the man 
"ho admits me/will someday sleep in 
br.d." The admissions officer who 
accepted that essay must have been 
really exhausted. 

Other essays are so well-written, 
they manage to shine through the 
book's how-to atmosphere as literary 
works 
in 
their 
own 
right. One 
applicant writes a parody of several 
famous authors writing about them-
selves for an application essay. "What 
would Hemingway write? ... 'My 
name is Ernest. I am a man. I am a 
writer. I would like to attend the 
University of North Carolina at 
Chapel Hill.' U .D. Salinger] 'Damn it! 
Why the hell are you asking my name? 
Phonies are always asking crap like 
that.' [Shakespeare] 'The wheel of 
fortune hath spun- that arrant whore 
bestowed upon me the most wretched 
of inquiries. Thy wit shall not go 
slipshod. Hear me committee- set less 
than thou trowest. I owest thou naught 
my name. Go to, have thy wisdom; it 
is William Shakespeare.' [And Freud] 
'Because of my pleasure derived from 
relieving myself during the Anal stage 
of development, I am basically an 
outgoing person.'" 

But such essays are rare. Too many 
students, 
the admissions officers 
complain, 
fall 
into 
the 
my-necktie's-too-tight style of writing. 
Curry and Kasbar offer a parody: 
"' am constantly striving to expose 
myself to every opportunity to become a 
person with a deep understanding of my 
own values and of the environment in 
which I fmd myself. 1 have participated 
in a broad range of activities, and I have 
endeavored 
to 
become 
ever 
more 
versatile and tolerant while at the same 
time solidifying my own ideals . . . " 

Often students fall into the trap of 
writing about the same hackneyed 
subjects. "Sometimes it seems there are 
only four types of essays," said one 
admissions officer: "the 'class-
president' essay, the 'I-lost-but-learned' 
sports essay, the 'I-went-to-Europe-
and-learned-how-complex-the-world-
is' essay, and the good old 'being-
yearbook-editor-sure-is-hard-work' 
essay. When I read one of those, it 
takes amazing willpower to get to the 
third paragraph." 

Essays that Worked helps encourage 
students to be creative when writing 
their essays. There is an awkwardness, 
however, in the process of sincerely 
selling oneself, 
an awkwardness 
inherent in the college application itself 
and 
exacerbated by 
how-to 
approach of Essays that Worked. "I didn't 
want this book to be a how-to," said 
Kasbar, who fought against including 
the little black-outlined boxes with the 
helpful tips, "but Rollin (the publisher] 
insisted." 

How-to books, after all, consistently 
make the national bestseller list. Every 
successful businessman who sells on 
the American market knows how to 
exploit the practical nature of the 
American 
psyche and 
that very 
American thirst for quick-'n-easy self-
help and self-development books. Even 
though the essays in Essays that WorW 
could have stood .respectably on their 
own without how-to camouflage, they 
probably would not have appealed to 
the panicking (and thus more likely to 
be spending) element of the student 
market. 

A 
price 
must be 
paid, 
however, 
for taking the 
money-
making, how-to route. In Essays that 
Worked even the most thoughtful, well-
written 
essays are cheapened.

Correction: In the September 5 issue 
ofTNJ, in my article 'Guarded Speech' 
I failed to make a distinction between 
the Thomas a Becket House, which I 
insensitively termed "the Episcopalian 
bastion at Yale" and the Episcopal 
Church at Yale; the two are discreet 
entitles. The Reverend Charies 
DinkJer is the chaplain of the former, 
while the Reverend Dorsey W .M. 
McConnell is the chaplain of the latter, 
Yale's Episcopal Church. I regret the 
error and apologize for any 
misunderstanding that might have 
ensued.
