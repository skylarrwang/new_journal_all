When the Yale Student-to-Student Counseling Service moved out of the University Health Services (UHS) bupding on Hillhouse Avenue in 1980, its· twenty or so members felt relieved. 

Their new headquarters, tucked in the basement of Bingham on Old Campus, may have looked small and the carpet frayed, but it was what they had always wanted-a place to call their own, far from Mental Hygiene with its waiting lists and white-coated professionals. 

Their new office seemed to be an accessible place where other students, graduate or undergraduate, could go to discuss their problems informally with people of their own age. They ·moved into their new room, set up the couch and chairs, and put up posters to hide the dingy walls. But day after day, year after year, hardly anyone has come. 

The counselors remain there: different faces, of course, but still waiting. Since the move, they renamed their program Walden Student-to-Student Counseling but kept its focus very much the same. Although Walden operates five nights a week, Sunday through Thursday, from nine p.m. until midnight, and last year provided a late-night telephone hotline, most undergraduates .still do not realize that it exists; only 55 people visited Walden last year. 

Under enthusiastic leadership, the counselors have made a commitment to reach a wider segment of the Yale population. To do so, they must combat years of obscurity and bureaucratic disorder; they also must face charges that they have inadequate training and worse, that their service is superfluous on campus. 

More than anything else, Walden suffers from a lack of continuity. No original charter or statement of intent exists; none of the current counselors knows of any records or documents, and even the names of the original counselors seem to have been consigned to oblivion. The exact year in which those first counselors founded Walden is murky too- maybe eight or ten or even eleven years ago, depending on which counselor you ask. 

Dr. Robert Arnstein, Chief Psychiatrist at University Health Services and a long-time Walden supporter, remembers that the group's tenancy at UHS was "the best solution that could be worked out at the time. They were glad to move out- they wanted to be separate from the Health Services, because they felt that there were people who wouldn't want to go to the Health Services who might want to go to them." Aside from Arnstein's recollections, no one seems to know anything about the early counselors except that their conviction of the importance of peer counseling sustaineq them year after year. 

According to Laura Trogolo, TC '87, the counselors still start from scratch. "We have no records from before. I think that in itself says something important," saidjames Gross, CC '87, the Walden Coordinator. "The problem is the same as with any student group- people come in:for two years and then go." 

Gross and Trogolo, along with the other counselors, realized that without a structure Walden would be doomed to repeat its mistakes. Last summer they created a set of bylaws, which explicate Walden's goals and its methods. The purpose of the group, as stated in these bylaws, is "to promote the psychological well-being of the Yale community . . . to increase awareness and understanding of mental health issues." The bylaws standardize the rules and procedures which Walden follows, specifying the number of counselors, the specific allocation of some of these to different aspects of the organization, · and the creation of leadership coordinating positions; the bylaws also require that each coordinator submit a written evaluation of the program at year's end.


Because of sporadic and inadequate publicity, low visibility perennially plagues Walden. The lack of a public image prompted earlier counselors to affix the name Walden, with its connotations of Thoreau-esque peace anrl stability, and to circulate posters and table tents bearing a Garry Trudeau cartoon, with the hope of evoking a recognition of the program and its services. Nonetheless, publicity has remained ineffective. According to Publicity Coordinator Bill Connors, MC '88, the distribution of table tents and posters has never been scheduled or monitored. Students who might benefit from Walden's services are often unaware of the organization, much less its location and hours. 

"What's important in this is the student's perception of Walden counseling, and I don't think there is one," said Gross. One of the counselors admitted that as a freshman, "I didn't know Walden existed, and I lived in Bingham." 

Taking a different tack, counselors last spring created Walden Outreach, a program sponsoring talks and forums an the colleges. Last year, counselors ran Outreach m addition to their other duties, but this fall three to five people make the new service their sole Priority. Their planned talks include During the three years that Laura T rogolo, TC '87, has been a W alden counselor, she has seen the program evolve from chaos to cohesion. rap sessions on "Being a Southerner at Yale" and "Getting Along with Your Roommate"; last year these discussions attracted more people than the total number who carne to the Bingham office. Outreach also plans biweekly table tents that its coordinator Liz Herzkovits, DC '87, hopes will provoke conversation at the dinner table, including "Safe Sex- Why it Matters, Even if You're Straight." 

Herzkovits readily conceded that while the Outreach program is designed to encourage the informal sharing of thoughts and feelings within the community, she hopes it will also foster an awareness of Walden in general and familiarize students with their services. "It will increase one-on-one counseling. When you've been to one of our forums, all of a sudden Walden has a face," Herzkovits said. 

Even if Outreach succeeds in bringing new recognition to Walden, students must finally decide for themselves whether or not they want peer counseling. Trogolo believes that they do. "Most of the 'counseling' that goes on at Yale is informal, in rooms, between friends," she said. "A lot of problems are better addressed by a peer." Despite her contention, over 1100 Yale students each year, graduate and undergraduate, seek out professional rather than peer counselins at Umverstty Health Services. Of this number, only about half actually receive help following the one screening session. The other 500 go home or go elsewhere- to freshman counselors, Dean's offices, or the clergy- but historically, they have not gone to Walden.


To account for their low turnout, many Walden counselors blame a Yale atmosphere which, they claim, is not conducive to an open discussion of problems. "There are many people who are afraid to admit that they hurt," •Trogolo said. "They'll go through four years with this amazing facade that everything's fine." Several counselors speculated that some of the overflow of Mental Hygiene patients could be channeled effectively, at least temporarily, into programs like theirs, but that UHS would not comply. "I get the feeling that UHS does not regard peer counseling as an effective method," Trogolo said. 

In fact, whether or not they grant them continuing care, UHS doesn't refer any patients to Walden. Dr. Arnstein emphasized that many of his patients at UHS believed they had already exhausted all options except for professional help. It would be more likely for Walden counselors to refer people to UHS than for Mental Hygiene personnel to send clients to Walden; nonetheless, the secretary at Mental Hygiene does keep a stack of Walden brochures on her desk. 

Trogolo admitted that some justification did exist for the reluctance of the professionals at UHS to make such referrals. "There's a danger in them referring people to us. We are not professionals," she said. 

Walden counselors receive extensive, though non-medical, training. Counselors undergo one weekend-long session at an off-campus retreat and then attend a series of talks and lectures, approximately every two weeks throughout the year. In the past, Dr. Lorna Sarrel, the coordinator of "Topics in Human Sexuality," Barbara Moynihan of the New Haven Rape Crisis Center, and other experts have lectured on issues such as sexual
