Crossroads: August 1986 
Mark Gevisser 
She is. a hard woman, I think from 
inside the van as she approaches: she 
has a yellow t-shirt pulled over an 
angular body, taut fine skin pulled 
over an angular face, a cigarette, and 
through the mud-stained glass of the 
window she shakes her head firmly, 
she spreads her hands out away from 
her chest, I watch her lips, the 
cigarette, her lips, "no," she says, 
"no, 
I 
will 
never go 
back to 
Crossroads." 
I am with SH AWCO, the Students' 
H ealth and Welfare Community 
Organization of the University of 
Cape Town, and we are parked 
outside 
the 
Elukhanyisweni 
Community Centre in Guguletu, a 
black township outside the South 
African city of Cape Town. Terrified 
+ The New Journal/October 17. 1986 
by the mere idea of being in a 
township, I have been hiding all day 
within the van's safety as it does its 
rounds. But at the sight of this woman 
(there is something in the way she 
shoots the smoke vertically out of her 
mouth), I unroll the window. I want to 
see, I want to hear- this is my 
country, my people. 


"And now they want to go back," the 
woman says. "They want to go back to 
Crossroads and rebuild, but no, I will 
never go back. My six-year-old son 
awakes every night with nightmares of 
the fighting, he screams and cries, and 
my daughter, 
my ten-year-old 
daughter says that if we go back she 
will run away." 

I am introduced to the woman, her 
name is Jen. "Are you a witdoek or a 
comrade?" I ask her. 

She looks at me, her small eyes 
burning my face, burning it red, 
"Look," she says, angry, "I am not an 
anything or an anything. I just want 
my freedom." 

Jen is a refugee from Crossroads, the 
black squatter-camp complex that was 
burned to the ground in May andjune 
of this year. She now lives at the 
Elukhanyisweni Community Centre 
along with 
151 
other adults, 
48 
children and 28 babies (I have a fact 
sheet in front of me). T here are ten 
such refugee centres in Guguletu and 
Nyanga, the townships that surround 
the sand-dunes where Crossroads once 
stood. The destruction occured when 
fighting broke out between 


'comrades' and 
the 'witdoeK, 
two 
factions within the squatter complex. 

I am a white South African, and 
these terms, 'comrade', 'witdoeK are 
heavily loaded for me: the media has 
successfully created a Beirut out of 
every black township- they are 
savagely killing each other, I am told, 
there is nothing we can do about it, so 
why even try? The comrades, I am 
told, are tsotsis, gangsters who are 
using the liberation movement as a 
blanket for crime and 
arbitrary 
terrorism. The witdoeke (so named for 
the white kerchiefs they wear around 
their heads) are, I am told, vigilantes 
who have formed into groups to 
protect themselves from the atrocities 
committed by the comrades, atrocities 
like the dreaded 'necklace.' 

The image of the 'necklace,' the 
township guillotine, is one of the few 
that the white authorities have allowed 
to filter through the news b lackout they 
have imposed: the victim, someone 
who has 'collaborated' 
with 
authorities, first has his hands and feet 
cut off and is then made to drink 
KUoline, and a burning rubber tyre, a 
necklace, is pla~ed around his neck. 

This is what I know before I join 
SHAWCO on one of its twice-weekly 
rounds of the refugee centres. The 
organization, 
made up of white 
students from the University of Cape 
Town, 
provides relief to 
Crossroads refugees in the form of 
provisions and medical attention. The 
workers of this organization now try to 
give me a more complete picture. They 
explain, with the help of Jen, how the 
conflict arose over the issue of whether 
or not the squatters would remain in 
Crossroads. 

All the inhabitants of Crossroads 
were illegally in the Western Cape, 
seeking employment in nearby Cape 
Town. Because of their illegal status, 
they were not entitled to 'official' 
housing in the townships, and the 
authorities 
had 
repeatedly tried, 
unsuccessfully, to remove them from 
the area. 

Wary of the squatter camp's 
increasingly powerful 
value 
as 
a 
symbol of resistance, the authorities 
devised an appeasement plan: the 
squatters were offered resettlement in 
Khayelitsha, a new township over 40 
kilometres away from Cape Town. 

The entire squatter complex would be 
"voluntarily dismantled," and would 
move, without any questions asked 
about the inhabitants' illegal status, to 
the land and facilities at Khayelitsha. 

The witdoekL, under the leadership of 
The image of the 
"necklace," the 
township guillotine, is 
one of the few that 
the white authorities 
have allowed to filter 
through the news 
blackout. 

Ngxobongwana, a despot who con-
trolled the camps, decided to accept 
this offer of resettlement. Most of the 
inhabitants of Crossroads saw, how-
ever, lurking behind the rhetoric of the 
government, just another 
forced 
removal. No guarantees were given 
that they would be allowed to stay in 
Khayelitsha; they could not afford the 
costs of commutin"g over 80 kilometres 
a day to their places of work; and , 
besides, says Jen, "we had made our 
homes in Crossroads." 

These people were, likejen, neither 
comrades nor witdoekL. They were 
nevertheless prepared to accept the 
comrades' 
directive 
to 
resist 
authorities, and, as they had done 
many times in the past, they refused to 
move. The government's Khayelitsha 
option, however, depended on the 
voluntary demolition of the entire 
squatter complex, and the witdoekL, 
determined 
to accept this 
option , 
began to wage major attacks on the 
comrades. Under Ngxobongwana's 
command, they eventually, amid st 
bloody fighting, burned the whole 
complex down. 

"And yes," says Jen, "yes, they were 
involved, those botre." She almost spits 
this last word out, which is the South 
African slang for 'police.' According to 
The New journaVOc1ober 17 1986 5 


the present State of Emergency in 
South Africa, police and army acti-
vities in the townships are not allowed 
to be reported, but many of the relief 
workers tell me that they too observed 
the military offering direct assistance 
to N gxobongwana and his troops. This 
makes sense: both the authorities and 
the witdoeke desired the demolition of 
Crossroads and the defeat of the 
comrades. And besides, the military 
has apparently been keeping such a 
tight watch over the township areas 
that the witdoeke would never have been 
able 
achieve 
such 
widespread 
destruction without the approval, 
either tacit or open, of the authorities. 

Aod so, under a cloud of smoke that 
could apparently be seen from all over 
Cape Town, the witdoeke moved out to 
Khayelitsha, while the main body of 
the destroyed camps disappeared into 
the surrounding townships. Under the 
leadership of the comrades, these 
homeless people formed themselves 
into ad hoc refugee communities in 
backyards, in church halls, 
in 
community centres like Eluk-
hariyisweni. There are now estimated 
to be, the relief workers tell me,nearly 
2000 
of them 
Nyanga and 
Guguletu. 

"Now you know more;' saysjen, "now 
you know the facts, ni? ," but her eyes 
still burning red into my face tell me 
that these facts do not matter here in 
the townships, here in the refugee 
centres. Jen is not an anything or an 
anything- she is a woman who wants 
her freedom, her basic rights. "Come," 
she says to me, "get out of the van now. 
Come and see." 

The Centre is a room the size of a 
small school hall, littered with blankets 
and gas burners. There is noise and 
6 The New Journal/October 17, 1986 
activity, a mother suckling her child, a 
radio blaring 
reggae. 
Rasta, 
comrade in charge of the community, 
is supervising the unpacking of food in 
the small ante-room. In a corner, a list 
of detainees, published that morning, 
has been tacked onto a noticeboard, 
and a half-dozen or so people mill 
around it. "They are looking for the 
names of their brothers," says Jen, 
"and their sons and their daughters." (I 
bad studied the same list earlier, and to 
my horror had found the names of 
three of my former classmates: the list 
of detainees is one of the only 
documents in South Africa that is 
colour-blind.) 

The 200 or so refugees have to sleep 
in shifts, Jen tells me. Now, in the 
mid-morning, seemingly oblivious to 
the activity around them, the old ones 
and the children are asleep. They will 
have to relinquish their spaces when 
the workers come back from Cape 
Town. And then, according to Jen, 
those who do not or cannot work 
during the day will spend the rainy 
winter night huddled around a gas-
burner in the tiny ante-room. If the 
night is fine, some might go into the 
yard, or walk a bit, but they prefer not 
to-even though there is no official 
curfew, the Casspirs (army riot control 
vehicles) are everywhere, giant bug-
like creatures spoiling for a fight. 

The food has been unpacked at 
Elukhanyisweni, and it is time to move 
on. Jen gets into the van with us- in 
exchange for some additional pro-
visions, she helps load and unload. A
