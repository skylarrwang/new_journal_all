Under 
Ngxobongwana's 
command, they 
eventually, amidst 
bloody fighting, 
burned the whole 
complex down. 
boy from the centre joins us as well. 
He enjoys the prestige and the 
diversion of driving around in the 
SHAWCO van, and is very friendly. 
"Howzit, my Comrade?" he says to 
me as he climbs in, giving me the 
liberation handshake. He is not at 
school: ·"Liberation Now, Education 
Later," he says, although he can hardly 
speak English. He smiles, pointing to 
his forehead. There he has pasted a 
sticker, like those we collected as kids, 
of the Soviet flag. He is 14 years old, I 
think. When I was his age I was not 
allowed to the corner store without my 
mother's permission, and this boy is 
fighting a revolution! 

It is this more than anything else 
that strikes me as we do the rounds of 
the refugee centres: the foot-soldiers of 
this revolution are children. It becomes 
very clear that the conflict between 
'wildoelcl and 'comrades,' between 
vigilantes and revolutionaries, 
is 
generational. Despite the occasional 
presence of an old man or woman, 
almost all the people in the refugee 
centres are under 35. 

We zigzag across the townships from 
one centre to another, from the Old 
Apostolic Church where the pews have 
been rearranged into makeshift beds, 
to the Presbyterian Church where five 
hundred people are living in a hall rich 
with the stench of urine and body 
odor, to the Nyanga Arts Centre, 
which is completely surrounded by 
Casspirs supervising the restoration of 
electrical wires torn down in the 
fighting. 

As we approach, 
a 
military 
serviceman, a young white South 
African doing his compulsory two 
years, jumps out of one of these 
armoured vehicles and walks over to 
us, his gun slapping against his thigh. 
"Oh, shit," someone inside the van 
says, and I realize, for the first time 
that day, that I have more to fear from 
these Casspirs and their operators 
(who are my classmates, my contemporaries- I could be one of them) than 
from any black comrade. 

The serviceman, visibly trembling 
beneath the bravado of his twenty-
year-old saunter, peers into the van 
and waves us on. I try to imagine what 
it must be like to spend two whole 
years observing the townships from a 
porthole of one of the Casspirs, being 
ordered to fire at fleeing people at any 
given moment. This is a real fear for 
me: if I ever want to return to live in 
my country, I too will have to do these 
two years. 

And then I put myself on the other 
side. I try to imagine what it must be 
like to spend a whole life observed by 
these metal creatures, these death 
machines. Jen teaches a drawing class 
at Elukhanyisweni, and she tells me 
that the art of her students, four-year-
olds, five-year-olds, is dominated by 
the Casspirs. 

I try to imagine as well what it must 
be like to live in one of these refugee 
centres, with no privacy, with the 
constant threat of confrontation and 
violence. I attempt to find out how the 
communities have organized themselves, but both Jen and the relief 
workers are disconcertingly vague: all 
I learn is that corruption is rife, that 
hoarding of provisions and infighting 
are day-to-day occurrences. Only last 
night, Jen says, a fight broke out 
between two comrades in one of the 
centres, resulting in a fatal stabbing. I 
look at the Casspirs, at the refugees, 
and once again I say to myself- this is 
my country, my people. 

The last centre we visit is a private 
home in Nyanga belonging to a 
woman named Ma Benga. She does 
not actually house refugees, I am told, 
but collects food from SHAWCO and 
distributes it to people squatting in the 
backyards of the neighbourhood. She 
has also all but given up her home to 
the comrades, who use it as one of their 
headquarters. 

It is now dusk, and walking into the 
dark livingroom, I sense, even before I 
can see anything, an atmosphere that 
is very male, very aggressive. At first I 
am terrified, conditioned by the image 
of the comrades presented by the white 
media. These are the ones, I think as I 
enter, who conduct the horrifying 
'necklacings,' who force people to eat 
washing-powder and drink paraffin 
bought at white-owned stores. It takes 
a bizarre combination of sheer terror 
and almost voyeuristic curiosity to 
prevent me from rushing back out to 
the safety of the van. 

As my eyes accustom themselves to 
the light, however, as the eyes of the 
men attach themselves to faces, to 
bodies, I experience a strange sense of 
elation. I look around me. Along the 
sides of the room, sitting on benches, 
are a dozen or so young men, my age, 
in their early twenties. Almost all of 
them have rasta dreadlocks and some 
are wounded: bandaged eyes, 
bandaged arms. 

One of them claps his hands, and 
they are all standing up, moving in a 
line out to the van, carrying bags of 
food into the house. I become part of a 
silent chain that brings the provisions 
into the house and stacks them in a 
corner of the kitchen. One of them 
salutes me as a comrade, but apart 
from that there is only the sound of 
sacks being passed, of shoes across the 
linoleum. I get the feeling that any 
verbal communication would destroy 
this 
fragile 
fraternity, 
this queer 
coalition of young black revolutionaries and young white relief 
workers from Cape Town. 

Look at us, I think- we are the same 
age, we have the same nationality, the 
same aspirations even, and we cannot 
even find a common language. A hand 
brushes mine as I am passed a sack of 
mieliemeal, and I quiver at this contact. 
I think of a performance which I saw 
a few days ago called Abamanyani, 
which is the Xhosa word for "coming 
together to create." Performed by a 
group of black and white dancers, it 
was an ear-splitting, drum-beating 
fusion of modern jazz, township jive 
and traditional rhythm. I was left, 
however, feeling unexpectedly 
empty- the tune that ran through the 
piece, "Abamanyani, 
Come 
Together, 
People of Afrika," seemed so 
meaningless, so hopeless and naively 
optimistic to me, a white South 
African chained by my race and my 
background to the plushly upholstered 
seating of the Baxter Concert Hall. 

And now I quiver when a comrade's 
hand, 
black hand, 
accidentally 
touches mine. Abamanyani, 
Together, People of Afrika, I start to hum, 
softly, 
feeling 
my heart beating 
throughout my body, Abamanyani, 
Come Together, People of Afrika, and I 
notice that someone else, behind me,


All that has been salvaged from a burning shanty will end up, eventually, in 
a heap in the corner of one of the refugee centers. 
behind a bag of potatoes or a can of 
paraffin, is humming too, Abamanyani, 
Come Together, People of Afrika. I look 
up, startled. There is a man, smiling, 
his face dark and muscular. 

"You have seen it, this Abamanyani?," 
he asks. 

"Yes," I reply, failing to avoid eye-
contact. 

"It is very good, nê?," he continues, 
laughing now. "My brother was in it." 

I want to laugh too, I want to talk, 
ask questions, what did you think of 
it?, what's your name?, which one was 
your brother?, where did you see it?, 
but suddenly there is a searing urge at 
the back of my throat, my hands are 
shaking, and I break the chain to rush 
outside and light a cigarette. 

The van is about to leave Ma 
Benga's. The relief workers, 
accompanied by the kid with the 
hammer and sickle on his forehead, 
climb back in, and as the van drives off 
along the gravel road, I see, through 
the mud-stained window, the 
comrade. He is looking directly at me, 
and he has his fist raised in a Black 
Power salute. Is he mocking me? Jen 
lights a cigarette and laughs, a deep 
throaty sound, and the fine, taut skin 
around her mouth wrinkles for the first 
time. 

"They are looking for 
the names of their 
brothers," she says, 
"and their sons and 
their daughters."
