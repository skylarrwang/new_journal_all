"The government 
controls everything 
and they will crush 
everything and 
nonviolence is the 
only way to do it in 
Poland." 
In Poland, Andzrej Slominski ran underground 
printing presses th at kept workers informed of 
strike action. 

Leaving Solidarity Behind 
As Andrzej Slominski opens the door 
to his apartment, two cats jump otT the 
sofa. Passing through his living room 
with its television, framed posters, and 
crucifix, he walks into his kitchen 
to pour a Coke and some tonic water. 
A baby carriage sits in a corner of his 
study, 
and 
a 
dartboard 
hangs 
against the wall. "A good way to let out 
your frustrations," he says, as he tosses 
a dart right next to the hull's eye. 
As a leading student activist a nd a 
founder of the Solidarity movement in 
Poland, Slominski has faced many 
frustrations. In December of 1984 he 
left Poland to come to the United 
States. Now a scientist at the Yale-New 
Haven Medical School, he works in 
Dr. John Pawelek's lab 
m 
the 
Dermatology Department. For the

past year and a half, Slominski has 
made New Haven his home, and for 
the moment he intends to stay. 

In his living room Andrzej Slominski 
leans against his sofa and begins to 
recount 
his experiences. 
Relaxed , 
wearing a 'Solidarity' T-shirt and blue 
jeans, he occasionally pauses to find an 
appropriate word in his English-Polish 
dictionary, 
or to 
emphasize an 
important 
fact. 
As 
his forehead 
wrinkles and his red mustache moves 
up and down, he relates through words 
and gestures his experiences while he 
was a medical student at the University 
of Gdansk. 

His story begins in 1976, when the 
Polish government once again raised 
the price of food . Workers, already 
feeling 
the effects of an ailing 
economy, were not about to let such an 
increase occur without some visible 
show of frustration. Their an~er led to 
the development of a two-day strike in 
which many laborers lost their jobs or 
were sent to jail. In response to the 
needs of the workers for legal aid, 
money and an alternative information 
source, a group of intellectuals in 
Warsaw developed a committee to 
defend the laborers. In Gdansk a 
similar group was organized and 
Andrzej Slominski was one of the 
founders. "Small groups of students 
were formed to help these people get 
information about the workers," he 
says. "I was involved in Gdansk."

words express his idea. "The key of the 
system 
is the control 
of the 
information," he says. "You cannot 
check if a fact is true or not true. The 
strike action was big but nobody knew 
about this." 

Alongside 
15 
other people, 
he 
helPed develop and deliver pamphlets 
on the plight of the workers. This 
experience in underground printing 
proved invaluable, because by 1977 he 
and 39 other students had created the 
Students' Committee for Solidarity. 
Consciously jeopardizing his position 
at the University, Slominski accepted 
the risk of organizing underground 
activities. "I was afraid," he says, "but 
if something around you is going 
wrong and y,ou see the injustice, and 
you don't react to the injustice, you 
help create the injustice. If just nobody 
will do this then the situation will 
remain the same." To 
situation Slominski 
underground printing 
began to inform 
existence of a 
movement. 

During the next 
number of people · 
student organizations 
gan 
increase. At the same time a parallel 
movement of workers emerged and 
underground trade unions began to 
gain larger memberships. Recognizing 
the necessity of unity, 
Slominski 
worked very closely with Lech Walesa, 
leader of the dockwork~rs' union in 
Gdansk, in order to collaborate on 
protest efforts. "I 
was the most 
involved in the cooperation with the 
underground trade union," he says. 
•since 1979 I knew Walesa well. We 
made some spectacular action, 
peaceful 
non-violent 
manifestation. 
The movement was from the begin-
ning non-violent." Slominski folds his 
arms 
across his 
chest. "The 
government controls everything and 
they will crush everything and non-
violence is the only way to do it in 
Poland. 
Violence gives birth to 
illlother violel)ce; you will form a spiral 
which you cannot escape." 

Instead Slominski helped organize 
demonstrations which condemned the 
use of violence by the government. 
Along with W alesa he worked on the 
memorial march which commem-
orated the deaths of a number of 
workers killed during a strike in 1970. 
The event became a rallying point for 
the labor movement, and the first 
march occurred in 1977. That year 
only two to three hundred workers 
participated, but by 1978 the turnout 
was already about 
five 
hundrej:l 
people. 
"We came with flowers," 
Slominski remembers. "Someone gave 
a short talk and then five minutes of 
silence, and then everybody went 
home." J uc before they reached their 
houses, 
many 
people 
were 
interrogated. Nevertheless, in 1979 
2,000 demonstrators 
commemorate the 
colleagues. That veiii!''Sl•n1

thing, the people start to believe you," 
he says. "The most important is to pass 
the barrier of fear. They had the 
example. We were ready to pay a high 
price for our beliefs." 

For whatever personal reason, the 
organizers willingly sacrificed a lot for 
their principles. 
Some involved 
themselves for political reasons, others 
for economic reasons, but Slominski 
and his friends were motivated by 
ideological and moral grounds. "I don't 
like to speak about politics," he says. "I 
don't like politics. When you are 
reacting against injustice everything is 
fme, but when you introduce politics 
into the situation . . . . " Unable to find 
the words to complete his thought, 
Slominski quotes a phrase a friend 
once said: "In politics, only the person 
who has his hand in his pocket is 
clean." 

While his point sinks in, there is a 
momentary break in our conversation. 
Slominski's red head shakes back and 
forth, and he frowns as he slowly 
explains, "When we are simplifying 
something, 
we are sacrificing 
something." With that warning he 
resumes his story. 

With the creation of Solidarity, the 
efforts of the last seven or eight years 
started to bring about results. A 
growing opposition movement devel-
oped to lay the groundwork for 
massive strike action, and Gdansk 
proved a focus point for much of the 
Solidarity activity that was beginning 
to break during this period. Working 
with Walesa, Slominski helped prepare 
for the dockworkers' strike. When the 
laborers 
finally stopped work, 
Slominski was on hand to get the 
information of the strike activity to the 
rest of Poland. "During the strike I and

order to distribute 
their 
pamphlets, Slominski took his material 
to crowded areas. He boarded buses 
with the journals hidden in his shirt. 
Once safely on the bus he then handed 
information to passengers willing to 
read it. "Some people then pass to 
others on the bus," he says. "You 
always go to overcrowded places 
because you could be trapped by the 
police. Sometimes you could throw 
pamphlets in the air and people would 
run and get them." The man who 
laughed a moment ago at the recol-
lection of how he managed to trick the 
police becomes grave for a second. He 
remembers two occasions when his 
precautions did not protect him. 

The first arrest occurred after the 
police stopped Slominski and found 
information in his car that was 
intended to go to another shipyard. He 
spent 48 hours in jail and was released 
after refusing to answer any of the 
questions the police posed during the

interrogation. The second time he 
faced much more of a risk of being 
locked up for a couple of years. "I was 
going back to the shipyard and I was 
arrested on the street by the secret 
service," he says. "They were watching 
people and they also arrested. my 
brother. It looked very serious." The 
timing, however, proved lucky for 
Slominski. It was the end of August, 
and Walesa was just about to sign 
agreements with · the government to 
end the strikes. But he refused to 
continue the talks until Slominski and 
other Solidarity leaders were released. 
After 18 hours he and some of his 
colleagues went home. 

Despite the success of the strikes and 
the promises extracted from · the 
government to improve wages and 
working hours and to allow increased 
human 
rights, 
Slominski did not 
secure permission to work in any 
university or as a physician in any 
large city. Instead, the government 
· forced him to find positions in small 
municipal hospitals. "When Solidarity 
got power I wanted to return to 
Gdansk," he says, "but the local 
Communist Party didn't agree to let 
me work there. I could only come back 
when the medical faction of Solidarity 
started to strike and the government 
representative agreed that we could 
return to the University." 

Slominski has, in the space of a 
couple of hours, attempted to condense 
six years of his life. His awareness of 
the problems oft simplifying history 
causes him to pause for a few seconds. 
The last part of the story is as dense as 
the first, and he must carefully allude 
to many events with far fewer words 
than they deserve. With a slight sigh, 
he begins to talk about the night before 
the declaration of martial law. 

On the twelfth of December, 1981, 
Slominski went to the last meeting of 
the trade union in Gdansk. He arrived 
with information that the government 
planned to arrest many people and 
presented it to the trade leaders. "We 
went with this information to the 
meeting," he recalls. "Most of the 
leaders didn't believe it. I didn't go 
home. I told my mother to tell my

Many of Slominski's friends and 
colleagues did not have his luck. The 
next day the government arrested and 
incarcerated thousands of Solidarity 
members. "The people didn't expect 
that a state of war would be intro-
duced," he says. "State of war with 
whom? Yeah, it was a state of war." 

Slominski looks down at his hands and 
smiles bitterly. The result of years of 
effort had apparently crumbled over-
night. "There is no situation that is 
completely pessimistic. And in the best 
of situations you should be prepared 
for the worst. If nobody stands behind 
some idea, this idea would stop to 
exist. We were sure that our idea was 
right," he says. "We were not so 
optimistic that something like 
Solidarity would happen in this couple 
of years. We looked for a small change 
give society an example. We 
expected after 20 years and maybe 
even longer and maybe after another 
generation, some democratic change 
... and it happened in three years!" 

However, it was not until August of 
1982 that Slominski came out of hiding 
as the result of a general amnesty. 
Aware that he would be barred from 
working at any university in Poland 
and from practicing medicine in the 
big cities following the eventual 
completion of his term at the 
University, Slominski knew he would 
be forced to work in small villages.
