EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Often the only ones in the Walden office, counselors Liz Herzkovits, DC '87, 
and James Gross, CC '87, still remain optimistic. 
assault, eating disorders, and tension. 
Role-playing is an additional, integral 
part of counselor training. "They bring 
out a lot of questions- the ability to be 
in a 
situation 
rather than think 
abstractly about it. To work out what 
works and what doesn't," Trogolo said. 
Most importantly, the training is 
designed to encourage active, non-
judgmental listening. The "training 
bible" of the Walden counselors, Peer 
Counseling, written by psychologists 
Peter Salovey and Vincent D'Andrea, 
defines the function of this type of 
listening as "not to solve people's 
problems for them but rather to assist 
them in finding their own solutions. 
Peer counselors don't tell people what 
they 'should' do ... " (p.3). While the 
book advocates both the role playing 
and the expert talks, it recommends 
training sessions of longer duration 
than Walden counselors receive: two 
10-week sessions of about four hours 
per week. 
Though the training program has 
been greatly expanded and structured 
over the past year, 
previous 
inadequacies haunt the group: they 
lacked a faculty adviser until their 
departure from UHS and, as recently 
as two yea.rS ago, they did not enforce 
attendance at training sessions. 
•People didn't come," Gross admitted. 
But he added that "it didn't immed-
iately follow 
that 
they 
were 
unqualified- some 
had 
been 
counselors the year before." This year, 
the counselors coordinated the man-
datory training sessio.ns more carefully 
with Julie Jenks, Walden's faculty 
adviser. A professional psychologist 
who received her training at Yale, 
Jenks directs the Counseling Center at 
Albertus Magnus College and runs a 
private practice in addition to her work 
at Walden. Jenks has been Walden's 
faculty adviser for the past five years; 
she serves as a liasion with UHS and 
draws in experts from various fields to 
educate the counselors. 
Counselors insist that their training 
prepares them for any situation-
whether a 
student fights with a 
roommate or contemplates suicide. 
Their role-playing encompasses both 
ends of this spectrum, and as members 
of a self-termed "crisis intervention 
center," they do not shy away from 
extremely serious cases. 


Beth 
McQuaid, TD '87, said that while her 
training prepared her to handle 
anything, she would immediately refer 
a student to UHS if he or she appeared 
to be dangerously ill or unstable. 
Even with this outlet, some experts 
doubt the ability of nonprofessionals to 
handle real emergencies. "Whether 
they would or should handle someone 
who was suicidal over a long time is 
something else entirely," Arnstein said. 
He stressed that the real question 
becomes whether or not they want to 
handle that kind of responsibility. 
Arnstein 
also mentioned the im-
portance of confidentiality, 
legally 
,enforced within Mental Hygiene but 
only encouraged within Walden. 
Practically, a student cannot take any 
action to preserve his or her confi-
dential status if a counselor abrogates 
it, although 
any sustainable 
accusations of this nature would result 
in the automatic dismissal of the 
counselor involved. 
The issues of both adequate training 
and confidentiality have recently been 
raised by critics of Walden. One Yale 
junior, who asked not to be identified, 
cited several cases of unprofessional 
conduct. Two years ago, two of his 
close friends visited Walden with 
problems. Both of them later told this 
student, 
who had 
experience in 
counseling, that their counselor~ had 
advocated 
concrete 
advice. 
The 
student said that his friends felt that 
Walden counselors dictated solutions 
to them, though Salovey's philosophy 
clearly discourages this technique. 
Consequently, both discontinued their 
counseling. He also said th~t a Walden 
counselor, in a friendly conversation, 
told him not only the specific details of 
a case but also the name of the student 
undergoing counseling. 
Current counselors deny any 
knowledge of past improprieties, but 
they continue to stress confidentiality. 
In fact, they will not reveal general 
types of cases or discuss statistics or 
any information related to specific 
clients. "If anything, we're too tight 
lipped," said Connors. 
Walden counselors keep their own 
concerns under equally tight wrap. 
Frustration does not seem to be a part 
of the Walden vocabulary, despite long


nights when no one comes in. "The 
night you're here for someone- that 
definitely keeps you going. There's 
nothing like the feeling that you've 
helped," McQuaid said. Gross agreed.

"We feel that the service is justified 
even if no rme comes, just because it's 
being offered," he said. "I think there's 
a lot of room for hope, though, and 
certainly for assuming there's a niche 
for us here." 

Yet, one wonders about the exact 
nature of that niche. With its new 
cohesion and apparent stability after 
years of uncertainty, Walden seems to 
be reaching maturity, five years after 
striking out on its own. The Out.reach 
program illustrates the desire of the 
current staff to bring what Trogolo 
called "a new atmosphere" to campus. 
"We can all become better counselors 
and better listeners," she said. This 
new 
atmosphere 
must 
start 
with 
Walden itself. Even with Outreach 
already in place, Walden faces its most 
serious 
challenge ever 
this year: 
persuading students that peer 
counseling can be both effective and, 
more important, trustworthy. If they 
can achieve this goal, Walden 
counselors will finally have found their 
place in the sun, in the basement of 
Bingham.
