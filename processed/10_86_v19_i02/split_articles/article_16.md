Essays That Worked: 50 Essays from 
successful Applications to the Nation's Top 
Colleges edited by Boykin Curry and 
Brian Kasbar 
1986 Mustang 
Publishing $7.95, 144 pages 
The how-to book is America's secular 
bible. Americans have an undying, 
. democratic belief that anyone can 
succeed with a how-to book at hand. 
All the secrets one needs in order to 
evolve from a humble ordinary into a 
shining success story can be found in 
slim, step-by-step, easy-to-read 
volumes. During the past decade, one 
of the hottest how-to markets has been 
the academic prep course. It started as 
a library of books whose binders read 
like a Dr. Seuss ·rhyme-MCAT, 
LSAT, GMAT, PCAT, VAT, DAT, 
SAT- helping students to master the 
standardized test. But, until recently, 
panicking applicants hav.e been left on 
their own to write the personal essay, 
perhaps the most challenging part of 
the application because it forces them 
to step out from behind masses of 
grades and test scores. 

Two Yale juniors, Boykin Curry 
(BR '88) and Brian Kasba,r (BR '88) 
edited a book that finally how-t<rizes 
the last bastion of individuality in the 
application process. Essays that Worked: 
50 Essays from Successful Applications to 
the Nation's Top Colleges is the answer 
agonizing high school students have 
been seeking. Curry and Kasbar 
received 500 essays from admissions 
offices around the nation as well as 
from their friends; they then selected a 
sampling and put them into a very 
carefully designed book. Even the 
cover reveals what Essays that Worked is 
all about: the art of packaging. The 
book looks like a reliable companion to 
Barron's SAT manual. Slim but not 
too slim, titled in bold black and red 
letters, it projects a crisply professional 
image. And inside, sprinkled among 
the essays, you'll find how-to tips in 
· little black-outlined boxes which remind: 
"Double-check for spelling, grammar 
and punctuation mistakes," "Make 
sure the essay looks .neat," and 
"Photocopy the essay and the rest of the 
application, sign it and mail it." 

Kasbar, Curry and their publisher, 
Rollin Riggs '79, understand well the 
art of people-packaging, the art of 
telling people to be themselves while 
telling them how to do it at the same 
time. 

Essays that 
Worked 
tries to 
condense the essence of the successful 
essay 
into . cheerful, 
encouraging 
advice. "The admissions officer wants 
to know the real you, and what makes 
you tick,". said the editors. "What do 
you see differently from your friends? 
Why do you want to go to college? Do 
you talk to yourself? Hate sunny days? 
Take baths instead of showers?' And, 
In order 
reinforce 
their own 
speculations, Curry and Kasbar go 
straight to the admissions offices. 
"What works 
best?" asked one 
admissions officer. "Honesty, brevity, 
·risk-taking, 
self-revelation, 
imaginativeness, and fine writing." 

While many of the essays in Essays 
that Work make · for worthwhile leisure 
reading-one about mismatched socks 
and another about pigging out on Oreo 
cookies come to mind- the dominant 
how-to-sell-yourself-w bile-sounding-
sincere tone of the book imposes an 
awkward hardness on the other more 
personal, emotionally vulnerable 
essays. This clashing of the hard · sell 
and sincere self makes me feel that 
maybe a book like this, which teaChes 
students to write about themseLves 
honestly yet competitively, takes the 
process of people-packaging a bit too 
far. 

"Sometimes I think about all the 
things that have happened to me in my 
life," begins one essay submitted 
anonymously, "and I wonder . . . what 
would the kids at school think if they 
knew that (N arne)- straight A + 
(Name) the Brain ... spent most of 
her childhood crying and feeling 
inferior because no one ever wanted to 
play with her . . . " The essay details 
her father's death and her feelings of 
being cheated by family members. 
"Sometimes I get so sick of things 
happening to me that I want to scream 
(and many times I do)," she writes at 
the end. "That's one reason I'm so 
anxious to get to college. I can't change 
my childhood into the one I wanted
