The Lost Language of Cranes 
by David Leavitt 
1986 Knopf$17.95, 319 pages 
Sitting around at a dinner party, 
picking at the leftover spaghetti and 
salad and downing the last of the cheap 
red wine, somebody brings up David 
Leavitt (TC '83). "David Leavitt's got a 
new book out," 路they say. Everybody 
starts to talk at once about the 
phenomenon that is David Leavitt, 
erstwhile Yale student, recipient of all 
of Yale's esteemed literary awards and, 
better yet, first published by 路 Knopf a 
year after graduation. "He only 
graduated in '83 and I hear his novel 
contract was for a million dollars!" If 
this is true, he deserves congratu-
lations. Nobody knows the name of the 
novel. But someone knows someone 
who knows him: "I hear he lives out in 
the Hamptons with his boyfriend and 
that he hates to go into the city." 
Nobody knows what the novel is 
about. Nobody really cares; they'll 
know soon enough. Sometime before 
the year is out everyone's got to read it; 
or at least, someone's got to read it. 
After all, he went to Yale. 

The Lost Language of Cranes, Leavitt's 
aew book and first novel, reads easily 
and quickly: at no time did I find it 
stilted or badly paced. Upon reflection, 
however, the book raises a number of 
questions: I find myself asking what 
motivates people to write works of 
fiction. With political, philosophical or 
history texts, 
the answer to the 
question "Why?" seems evident: 
because they have something to say, 
some theory to propound, some system 
or lack thereof to struggle with. The 
case of fiction, however, is not so clear: 
writers of fiction must feel, necessarily, 
that they have something to say, and 
that in some profound way their 
message is relevant to others: without 
this basic conviction, there is no point 
in writing at all. But if-as in the 
instance of David Leavitt-the moti~ 
vation is highly political, then the issue 
remains of "Why fiction?" Why not 
write a strictly polemical text? Does the 
author choose to write fiction because 
he/she is most comfortable with that
genre? Or because he/she believes that 
the novel, for example, is the most 
effective vehicle 
for 
the 
message 
involved? Or perhaps because the 
appeal of fiction will carry the message 
to the widest audience? And once the 
decison to write fiction has been taken, 
does it impose constraints upon the 
author's political statement, or vice 
versa? It seems clear that the power of 
the author's statement in no way 
guarantees the quality of a work of 
fiction, but at the same time one can 
argue that the politics of the book 
ensure that it is worth reading even if it 
is not successful as a work of fiction per 
se. In other words, in a work of 
political fiction, i( one is to have 
primacy over the other-and this is a 
big if-which is it to be, the politics or 
the fiction? 

David Leav.itt, author of the highly 
successful collection of stories entitled 
Family Dancing, faces some, if not all of 
these issues in his novel. To anyone 
familiar with his work, the subject of 
The Lost Language of Cranes comes as no 
surprise; indeed, the basic elements that 
pervade his short stories are present in 
his novel: 
the protagonist, Philip 
Benjamin, is a young, white, upper-
middle class, college-educated 
homosexual faced with the problem of 
coming out to his parents, Rose and 
Owen. As in Leavitt's stories, the 
mother figure is central to the family 
dynamic. Aside from his relationship 
with her, Philip lives in an almost 
exclusively gay and predominantly 
male world, 
as his lover, 
Eliot, 
introduces him to the chic gay scene of 
downtown New York. 

The situation of Philip's father is, at 
the outset, the most intriguing in the 
book: ostensibly the happily married 
and res'Pectable director of admissions 
at a 
private boys school, Owen 
Benjamin has been leading a double 
life for years. Unbeknownst to his wife 
and son, Owen frequents gay porno-
graphic cinemas on the Lower East 
Side where he has hasty anonymous 
encounters with other men. Philip's 
revelation to his parentS' that he is gay 
throws Rose and Owen's marriage into 
a state of crisis, forcing to light the 
secrets of twenty-five years of 
marriage. 

Set in New York City, the novel has 
all the trappings of a trendy post路 
collegiate existence. The world of 
small, grubby studio apartments on 
the Upper West Side, of cheap Indian 
restaurants in the East Village, of 
Palladium and Boy Bar and Shescape, 
is strikingly familiar. And as Philip 
bemoans his love life over coffe'e with 
Brad, a friend made in college through 
the "Gay Lesbian Campus Coalition," 
I feel I am reading a conversation 
transcribed in the Anchor Bar. It 
' ~eems dishearteningly predictable. 

Despite such moments of recog路 
nition, much of the book is foreign 
and, for me as a woman reader, 
extremely alienating. Leavitt writes of 
a lifestyle in which women have no 
place; his treatment of the three female 
characters in the book shows only 
minimal understanding of and relative 
indifference to the way in which they 
think. The development of Rose, 
Philip's mother, is perhaps the best 
example of this problem. In her fifties, 
rooted in a job as a copy editor which is 
apparently of little interest to her, and 
with no close friends to speak of, Rose 
discovers that both her son and her 
husband are gay. 
Given , that 
heretofore Rose has kept the family 
together- Philip and Owen, we are 
told, have never been close-such 
news is a momentous blow. The 
potential for exploring Rose's reaction 
seems to me to be complex and 
powerful, 
if difficult. 
Leavitt, 
however, writes Rose as having one 
flat and monolithic reaction beyond 
which he does not need to look: 
time and again she responds to their 
confessions with statements like: "I 
don't 
believe that just because 
something's 
a 
secret 
it 
therefore by definition has to be 
revealed . . . Keeping certain secrets 
secret is important to- the general 
balance of life, the common utility." 
While resistance to the news is 
undoubtedly a large factor in Rose's 
reaction, and apparently the only 
aspect expressed verbally, it cannot be 
the only feeling she has. Just because

she doesn't want to think about her 
husband and son being gay doesn't 
mean she can avoid it, or that David 
Leavitt can avoid writing about it. And 
yet, with the exception of one interior 
monologue in which Rose sees herself 
as numb, and then as angry, he does. 

Philip and Owen's discussion at the 
close of the book is representative of 
Leavitt's own irresponsibility in his 
treatment of Rose: "I met a man the 
other night," he (Owen) said, "who I 
think I may see again. Also married, 
younger than me, but not much. I like 
him very much." "That's good," Philip 
said. And again, for emphasis, "That's 
good. But what about Mom?" Owen 
sighed. "I don't know," he said. "I just 
don't know." "I'm sure everything will 
be fine," Philip said. 

The implication, it seems, is that 
nobody cares what happens to Mom: 
Nor is Rose 
the only woman 
flattened by Leavitt's na.rrative: the 
presentation of J erene, a lesbian friend 
of Philip's, is equally trite. Leavitt's 
book addresses homosexuality, but 
Jerene and her lover Laura are the sole 
representatives of the 
lesbian 
community to appear in it. The author 
delves into Jerene's past with this 
superficial exchange iUustrating her 
relationship with her mother: "Why do 
you always wear those ugly pants when 
rve bought you so many pretty 
dresses?" "'Pretty dresses look stupid on 
me," she (Jerene) said. As Leavitt 
writes the lesbian characters, they are 
merely tokens, abstract types, and it is 
unclear why he bothers to include them 
at all. Furthermore, while Leavitt is 
ostensibly attempting to demystify 
homosexuality, 
to bring it 
into 
mainstream fiction as a 
concrete 
reality, his portrayal of lesbians is very 
much the perpetuation of a myth. 

Leavitt takes far greater pains with 
development of his male 
characters, and the portions of the 
novel dealing with Philip, Owen and 
Brad in particular are vividly written. 
Leavitt captures extremely well Owen's 
mounting tension and his increasing 
difficulty in controlling the deception 
he has created. The progression of 
Philip and Owen's relationship to the 
confessional scene that closes the book 
is very moving, and there is one 
discussion of homosexuality that the 
two engage in over dinner that is 
particularly compelling. It is too bad, 
perhaps, that Leavitt does not focus 
even more on Owen's life and on the 
interaction of father and son; the 
book's emphasis on Philip's love affair 
with Eliot is, 
in comparison, 
of 
minimal interest, following as it does 
the brief and predictable course of 
many such affairs, both homosexual 
and heterosexual, without shedding 
any new light on the issue. 

There remains, the vividness of the 
gay male characters notwithstanding, a 
problem within that aspect of the 
novel's construction: more than on gay 
men themselves, Leavitt concentrates 
on their homosexuality, such that it 
appears the sole driving force in their 
lives. Both Owen and. Philip, like 
Rose, have little interest in their 
careers and few friends, and both of 
them spend an inordinate amount of 
time either thinking about or having 
sex, to the exclusion of everything else. 
Of Philip, we are told: "In Eliot's 
absence, 
Philip found himself 
possessed of an unprecedented raging 
libido. Unable to concentrate, acutely 
sensing his aloneness, he would 
sometimes have to jerk off five or six 
times before he could fall asleep." 

Were the book ever to deal with 
Philip's- or Owen's, 
for that 
matter-existence as a being aside 
from his sexuality, both the novel and 
the characters would be strengthened. 
The number of masturbatory scenes in 
the seats of gay porno movies are no 
doubt justified to Leavitt as a 
manifestation of homosexuality which 
must be included in the novel in order 
to stress, concretely, what it means to 
be gay. Perhaps, however, one or two 
such scenes would suffice. In the 
quantity in which they appear in the 
book they are monotonous, reductive 
of the characters they are discussing, 
and detrimental to the quality of the 
novel as a whole. 

I believe that in trying in this way to 
give primacy to the politics of his 
fiction, 
to 
presentation of 
homosexuality as it is, Leavitt has 
undermined his own enterprise: he has 
failed 
to portray gay men as 
individuals of a certain complexity; 
they appear only as people constantly 
led around by their sexual drive. The 
homosexual relationship hetween Brad 
and Philip that develops over the 
second half of the book is the only one 
based on friendship rather than lust; 
breaking the chain oflonely encounters 
or auto-erotic indulgences seems to me 
to be a far more positive message to 
gay and straight readers alike, and I 
wish-perhaps because I like happy 
endings- that there were less of a sense 
of rarity about their relationship than 
Leavitt seems to suggest. 

At the same time as I am advocating 
a novel about gay men instead of about 
homosexuality, I recognize the need 
for the latter in fictiOJ?. today. Novels 
about relationships like Philip and 
Brad's, based on the mutual respect 
and love of two people, might not have 
the political impact on the mainstream 
audience that the gay movement 
needs. Perhaps books about gay male 
lust are what is necessary now, to 
awaken the public, and to shock. the 
public, even if the results are books of 
diminished 
interest in 
and of 
themselves. If this is the case, I wait 
with impatience . for gay writers to 
undertake this task, as Leavitt does in 
The Lost Language of Cranes, so that they 
can go to more interesting things. 

Leavltt has too much talent and 
potential as a writer to be confined to 
writing books that are a dull political 
necessity. 

After reading the book in 
its 
entirety, I feel confused and alienated 
by Leavitt's misogyny; I feel frustrated 
with the sacrifices he makes of the 
complexity of his characters in order to 
stress their sexuality; but the fact 
remains that I read the book with 
路 interest, that at no point did I throw it 
down in disgust or boredom. This, I 
think, is a tribute to Leavitt's style, and 
to his vivid, if not always complex, 
portrayals of the male characters in his 
book. 

The Lost Language of Cranes speaks to 
the experience of an exclusive group of 
gay men- I believe not even to the 
majority of the gay community-and 
to all but those few it presents a closed 
system 
from 
which readers 
are 
destined to feel distance. A quotation 
from the brief central chapter that 
gives the book its name best describes 
the novel's effect: "There was a crudely 
cut peephole in the fence, and through 
it she stared at the vast pit from which 
the building would arise, watched the 
cranes lunge and strain. She stood in 
the deafening roar of the cranes. In the 
grinding, the churning, the screeching, 
in the universe of cranes, the womb of 
cranes, she stood there, eyes open, and 
listened."
