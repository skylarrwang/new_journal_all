attend the same convention. At the 
meeting in West Germany, Pawelek 
met many Poles with 
whom he 
sounded out the possibility of visiting 
Poland, 
the country 
his family 
originally came from. He returned to 
the United States, very interested in 
this potential trip. Back in New 
H aven, Pawelek received a request 
from a man named Andrzej Slominski 
who wanted a position in Pawelek's 
lab. 
Assuming he had talked to 
Slominski in West Germany, Pawelek 
offered him a fellowship provided by 
the Lawrence Gelb Foundation and 
sponsored by the Clairol Company. 
When Slominski found out that he 
had a position in Pawelek's lab, he 
again tried to get permission for a 
temporary passport to the United 
States. 
And 
again 
the Polish 
government would allow him to leave 
but not to return. "In Poland I was an 
example 
of something 
for some 
people," he says. "The government 
wanted me to leave because I was a 
bad example. I knew that my period at 
the University would end. For me it 
was a choice of spending the rest of my 
life as a physician in a small village." 
Slominski was too committed to his 
scientific research to be content with 
such a future. "Every now and again 
you run across people who simply must 
do something. Andzrej is a natural. He 
won't do anything but be a scientist," 
Pawelek said. So Slominski made the 
choice to leave everything he was 
familiar with, to come and continue his 
research in the United States. After 
spending a short period of time in 
political asylum at the United States 
Embassy in Warsaw, he went to West 
Germany for three weeks. In Germany 
he took "a small introductory course 
about the USA." From there he went 
to New Haven. 

Slominski's choice of career over 
family and the now underground 
Solidarity movement proved to be a 
difficult decision. But he does not 
regret 
his choice. 
His 
work in 
Solidarity has not been wasted, for the 
movement continues even though the 
activity is conducted in secret. "It is 
impossible to form big organizations. 
You should build an underground 
second society behind the system 
which exists," he says. 

Slominski feels that since the period 
of martial law, that second society has 
continued to grow and develop. He 
points to the many underground 
printing presses of professional caliber 
that produce books, journals and 
pamphlets. 
He mentions the 
independent companies that make 
cassettes and videos with protest 
themes in the songs and drama. "The 
movement has the support of half the 
society. You cannot put millions of 
people in jail," he says. Lectures by 
activists are frequently held in 
churches 
and alternative education 
programs are offered on increasingly 
large scales. 

But Slominski must view all of this 
activity from afar. Although he writes 
to his parents and talks to his family 
on the phone, he knows that his letters 
are censored and that his conversations 
are bugged . On one occasion he tried 
to talk to his brother about the 
Chernobyl nuclear disaster, but he 
stopped because his brother's voice 
became too faint to hear. As soon as his 
brother mentioned other issues, the 
sound became clear. 

Despite the absence of his family, 
Slominski has managed to make: a 
home for himself in New Haven. As 
soon as he landed at Kennedy Airport 
in New York, he was met by Dr. 
Pawelek, his sponsor. "When we 
finally heard he was coming it was very 
exciting," said Pawelek. This ex-
citement manifested itself in people's 
enthusiasm to learn about Slominski's 
past. He recalls colleagues in the lab 
frequently asking him to talk about his 
experiences in Poland. "People were 
excited but it depended when and 
where you are speaking," Slominski 
says. "In the lab I could tell them story 
and story and story. They could see the 
living example of something they were 
seeing on T .V." Slominski laughs as he 
remembers his initial difficulty relating 
the events he had helped create. 

To learn English more rapidly, 
Slominski watched a lot of television. 
"I don't like commercials generally, but 
I have watched commercials because it 
is the best way to learn English because 
it is very simple," he says. Despite his 
initial language problems, he soon 
adopted and enjoyed many aspects of 
Western culture. Supermarkets proved 
to be a particular pleasure. "You can't 
buy almost anything in the shops (in 
Poland)," he says, "and here you can 
have 
everything 
you 
want." Nevertheless, Pawelek does not 
feel 
Slominski 
ever 
became 
overwhelmed by the wealth of the 
United States. "He is not the type of 
person to be swayed by luxury and 
wealth," Pawelek said. "What he wants 
to have is freedom and the ability t.o 
think." 

At least for the next couple of years, 
Slominski plans to continue 
his 
research at Yale. He finds New Haven 
a welcoming place, and he has been 
able to make many friends, among his 
colleagues and through the Polish 
community. A big: grin crosses his face 
as he announces'Â· that this year he 
married a woman named Elisabeth. 
She is also a Polish immigrant, and the 
two of them live in the downstairs 
portion of her grandmother's house. 
To complete the family, his wife is 
expecting a child in january. At age 32 
Slominski will be not only a husband, 
but a father. 

Relaxing on the edge of the sofa, 
Slominski sums up the contributions 
he helped give to Poland: "In 1970 in 
Gdansk it was 20 people and all the 
people were afraid. I used to feel very 
alienated. My friends would look at me 
and wonder what I was doing. Now 
you can find thousands of people who 
want to do this, and they are not 
afraid!" Slominski stops himself as his 
enthusiasm gives way to resignation. 
"Now, 
there 
is 
no 
way 
I 
can go back."
