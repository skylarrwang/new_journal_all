Rick Wolff, the Green's mayoral candidate, turned his education against his alma mater. 
"The city's disintegrating and what arc 
we doing? We're remodeling buildings 
on 
Chapel Street, San 
Fran-
cisco-style!" The booming voice drops, 
becomes savagely 
mocking. 
"How 
charming. Really, aesthetically they're 
quite pleasing," the eyes widen, the 
voice climbs, "but they're absurd! In 
this city, with its needs and its 
problems and its collapse! It's absolute 
craziness!" The voice moderates. "The 
Green Party, in a nutshell, is devoted 
to saying all this. The Green Party is a 
little like that fairy tale of the emperor's 
new clothes. We're that little kid who 
says"- the hands, clasped, form a 
megaphone, 
the voice climbs 
to 
falsetto-•It's not new clothes! He's 
10 The New Joumal/October I 7, I 986 
na-a-a-ked!" The voice regains its angry 
edge. "And we have the same problem 
the child does. Everyone wants to 
shush us up, you know? 'Shhh,"'- a 
mocking whisper emerges from behind 
one waggling finger-"Don't do that! 
Don't do that!" Abruptly, the burly 
man leans back in his chair, crosses his 
legs, drops his hands in his lap, and 
grins. "It's hysterical." 


Since the days when Yale professors 
warned him to stop protesting the 
Vietnam War, no one has been able to 
muzzle Rick Wolff. Last year, as a 
mayoral candidate in New Haven, he 
emerged as the most prominent and 
controversial member of the Green 
Party. Though only five months old 
and with a budget of only $15,000, the 
Greens fielded eight aldermanic 
candidates as well as contenders for 
both Mayor and City/Town Clerk in 
the November elections. Two of the 
aldermanic candidates won more than 
25% of the vote in their wards, and 
Wolff garnered 10°/o city-wide, 
beating the Republican candidate in 11 
of the 30 wards. Though Democratic 
officials credit the Greens with raising 
the issues that shaped last year's 
campaign, they regard the Green 
Party as a fringe group with little hope 
of achieving their idealistic vision for 
New Haven. Greens claim that within 
five years they will be a 
major 
contender in New Haven politics, 


Wolff received both his academic 
and his political education in New 
Haven. As a Yale graduate student in 
the late sixties, he earned masters 
degrees in economics and history, and 
a doctorate in economics. His deep 
involvement in the Yale-New Haven 
Committee against the War radi-
calized his politics and introduced him 
to the 
New 
Haven community. 
Though he has commuted to teach 
since his graduation in 1969-first at 
City College in New York, and since 
1973 , 
at the 
University 
of 
Massachussetts at Amherst- he has 
made his home here. Living in New 
Haven sensitized Wolff to municipal 
issues. As a homeowner, he was 
angered by the city's property tax 
rates, now the highest in Connecticut. 
As a father, he was appalled by the 
deterioration of New Haven's public 
schools. 


Contemplating the city's economic 
woes led Wolff to his obsession: "The 
absurd phenomenon that the seventh 
poorest city in the United States 
subsidizes the second or third richest 
university in the world became the 
galling summary of what was wrong 
with New Haven." Though he worked 
on Democratic campaigns in the 
1970s, Wolff became convinced that 
the Democrats would never confront 
what he perceives to be the city's basic 
problems, because of their two "articles 
of faith": never oppose Yale's wishes, 
and never question the Mayor's plan 
for downtown revitalization. 


Wolff was 
not alone 
in his 
frustration . For years disaffected 
~mocrats had discussed forming a 
'"•rd party in New Haven, but nothing 
had jelled. In the spring of 1985, 
Wolff and several other progressives 
proposed the idea of creating an 
alternative party to residents they 
thought might be interested. By June, 
feeling they had enough support to try 
their idea on the general public, they 
called 
a 
convention 
lay 
the 
foundations for the Green Party. 
Among the more than 100 people 
who attended that first convention was 
Morrison did not 
support the strike, and 
McKivigan concluded 
that the "outsider" had 
joined the Democratic 
mainstream. 
Jack McKivigan, Associate Editor of 
the Douglass Papers and a lecturer in 
History and Afro-American 
Studies departments at Yale. He had 
read 
an 
announcement 
for the meeting in the New Haven 
Advocate and decided to investigate. 
Not expecting to find much support, 
he was impressed by the large showing 
and by the open, flexible nature of the 
convention. "I could see that this party 
was going to be what the people 
wanted to make it," he remembered. 
After arriving at Yale in 1979, 
McKivigan, too, worked to elect 
Democrats. He volunteered for Bruce 
Morrison's first congressional 
campaign in 
1982 against an 
incumbent Democrat. H e considered 
Morrison an outsider, a challenger to 
the 'Democratic machine.' But when 
Local 34 struck Yale he began to see 
New Haven politics from a new 
perspective. Morrison did not support 
the strike, and McKivigan concluded 
that the 'outsider' had joined the 
Democratic mainstream. Seeing "four 
horsemen arriving from the New 
Haven police force every morning to 
intimidate strikers," convinced him 
that the municipal government backed 
the Yale administration against the 
strikers. 


Like Wolff, 
McKivigan 
turned to the Greens as an alternative 
to the Democratic Party. 
Though McKivigan, in contrast to 
the volcanic Wolff, spoke slowly, 
drawing each word out as he groped 
for the next, he evinced the same 
striking intensity of commitment as he 
discussed the Green Party's vision for 
Haven. The Green Party's 
14-page platform, which outlines that 
vision, bears on its title page the motto: 
"THINK GLOBALLY 
ACT 
LOCALLY." McKivigan explained 
that the platform attempts to adapt the 
environmental, 
a nti - nuclear 
philosophy 
of the West German 
Greens to the realities of New Haven. 
It outlines each problem the Greens 
have identified and proposes remedies. 
Proposals include making city officials 
more accessible and accountable to the 
public, 'municipalizing' the United 
Illuminating 
Company, 
and 
eliminating all nuclear and military 
research 
a nd production in New 
H aven. Though at times the platform 
seems to stray from reality- for 
example, calling for the community to 
adopt a 'holistic lifestyle' that will turn 
New H aven into an 'ecotopia'- the 
platform nevertheless testifies to the 
Greens' organization and follow-
through. Indeed, the ·Greens have 
produced a comprehensive statement 
of principles and proposals before any 
other New Haven party. 


The Greens also split with the 
Democrats over political tactics. To 
maintain grass-roots spontaneity, they 
try to avoid establishing titles and a 
concomitant party hierarchy and to 
prevent any one personality from 
dominating the 
organization. To 
simplify abstruse issues and increase 
popular interest, 
the Greens 
established a theatre group to perform 
skits at town meetings and other 
events. According to Jeri Baker, the 
party's Acting Chairperson, "We try to 
make this as fun as possible for people, 
because we feel that a major reason 
we're in such a state is that politics is 
calculatedly boring." 


Armed with this strategy, a lucid 
platform, and enormous enthusiasm, 
Greens embarked on their 
campaign publicly hoping for one 
percent of the vote and privately 
expecting between 
two and four 
percent. They were astonished by the 
election results, and attribute them to 
their success in raising three issues that 
they say 
k~pt the incumbent 
Democrat, Mayor Biagio DiLieto, on 
the defensive throughout the 
campaign: the means by which New 
Haven should dispose of its solid 
waste; the Democrats' development 
plan; and Yale's financial contribution 
to New Haven. 


For many years, Yale has resisted 
pressure from the community to make 
some sort of a contribution- a tax 
payment or a payment in lieu of taxes, 
such as Harvard makes to Cambridge. 
Yale maintains that it is both unlawful 
and unprincipled to expect money 
from 
tax-exempt, 
not-for-profit 
institution. According to Joni Barnett 
of the Yale Office of Community 
Relations, "Yale University thinks that 
its endowment, which it got over a 
period of 280 years from alumni 
should be used for its educational 
purpose- to admit students regardless 
of their 
need." The Democratic 
administration, like the Greens, feels 
that Yale should pay, but insists there 
is no legal way to force a payment. 
Joe Carbone, Executive Assistant to 
the Mayor since 1980, accuses the 
Green Party of "sheer demagoguery." 
He thinks Green Party members 
deliberately 
deceive 
voters by 
distributing flyers proclaiming, "Vote 
Green, Tax Yale!" He explained that a 
city government does not have the 
power to remove a tax exemption. 
Furthermore, 
the state legislature 
woul<Lnever consider empowering the 
city to tax one exempt institution while 
12 The New JournaVOctober 17, 1986 
leaving other tax-exempts- churches, 
schools, 
social service organi-
zations- untouched. A payment in 
lieu of taxes also cannot be legislated, 
and the university has for years refused 
to negotiate one. Carbone pointed to 
contributions Yale makes to New 
Haven. Despite its vast amount of tax-
exempt property, Yale is New H aven's 
fifth largest taxpayer. It is also New 
H aven's largest employer and attracts 
affluent students who spend money in 
local shops and restaurants. 


In 
addition to generating revenue for the 
city, Yale contributes to New Haven's 
cultural life through _its museums. But, 
Carbone is quick to add, "None of that 
is adequate." The Mayor plans to 
encourage Yale to invest more in local 
development projects. 


Wolff, 
who has studied 
University's annual financial report 
every year for ten years, argues that 
New H aven, in effect, financially 
supports Yale, while Yale serves a 
national constituency. Though Yale 
pays to support the city sewage 
treatment plant, it contributes nothing 
to the fire department that responds to 
between 200 and 300 alarms at Yale 
buildings each year or to the public 
school system that educates its labor 
force. The state government partially 
compensates New Haven for the 
revenue it cannot raise from tax-
exempt institutions. Greens say that 
Yale, not the city or state, should pay 
for the services it uses. McKivigai}, the 
party's Press Secretary, sent a letter 
this fall 
to Yale President Benno 
Schmidt proposing that Yale negotiate 
financial 
settlement with New 
Haven. He was not optimistic about 
the letter's impact. Last year he sent 
the same proposal to Bart Giamatti, 
who never responded. 


If Yale administrators won't 
negotiate a payment, then the Greens 
plan to force it out of them. Wolff calls 
the Democrats 'gutless wonders' for 
claiming that the city government can 
do nothing to tax Yale, and he 
proposes two possible methods. One 
option would be for the city to pressure 
the state legislature to restrict Yale's tax 
exemption. And why hasn't this tactic 
been tried? "It has to do with Yale's 
influence, and its determination not to 
pay," Wolff said: In addition, the city 
could take action without appealing to 
the state. By enforcing existing tax 
laws, it could make Yale pay taxes on
