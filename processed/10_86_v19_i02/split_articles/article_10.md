its operations that compete with local 
businesses. He cites the Yale Golf 
Course and Computer Center as 
properties that can be taxed because 
they 
serve 
people outside 
the 
University. 

An 
independent 
group that 
examined New Haven's tax system 
reached similar conclusions. In 1982 
the Board of Aldermen appointed a 
New Haven Revenue Commission to 
explore means by which the city could 
generate more revenue. Wolff served 
on the commission. Among other 
evidence, 
group examined a 
lengthy statement from Yale detailing 
ill financial 
relationship 
to New 
Haven. 

In 
February, 
1985, 
Commission delivered its final report, 
which advised the Board of Aldermen 
to lobby the state legislature to reform 
laws governing tax exemptions as well 
as to enact new laws allowing cities to 
charge 
tax-exempt 
institutions for 
municipal 
services. 

It 
also 
recommended that existing tax laws be 
better enforced, making specific note 
ofthe Yale Golf Course and Computer 
Center. The Board of Aldermen, 
however, re~cted the report. 

Eventually, says Wolff, Yale will 
pay. "We will one day see a meeting of 
Mr. DiLieto, if he's still the Mayor, 
and Mr. 
Schmidt, 
or whoever 
succeeds him, and they'll have a big 
celebration on the Green. And with 
gr"eat fanfare the head of Yale will 
hand a check over for one million 
bucks ... We'll force that out of them. 
That of course will not be adequate 
and we'll scream about it. But that's 
what's coming. Yale knows it, too. 
They're just gonna wait as long as they 
can." 

The Greens' crusade does not focus 
10lely on taxing Yale. They also attack 
the Mayor's city development plans. 
By encouraging developers to remake 
New Haven, DiLieto hopes to attract 
~ 
businesses that will provide the 
City with new jobs and revenue. In 
order to draw developers to New 
Haven, 
the city invested in the 
~eUing of the Shubert Theatre as 
~display of confidence in its future. 
&qe Shubert also attracts affiuent 
patrons who frequent restaurants and 
shops downtown, bringing money into 
the city. But the city continues to pay 
over one million dollars a year to keep 
the Shubert running. 

The Greens think that the Mayor's 
priorities are backwards. "We don't 
have a decent library system for 
residents," McKivigan said, "bu! we'll 
subsidize someone from Woodbridge 
seeing 'Biloxi Blues.'" Wolff argues that 
remodelling the Shubert marks the 
latest misconceived attempt by 
Democrats to replace the city's eroding 
industrial base with a service economy. 
He said that this economic policy, now 
over 20 years old, has succeeded only 
in pushing 20,000 people out of the 
city and in saddling New Haven with a 
host of economic and social problems. 
"This is absurd," Wolff said. "Any 
policy ought to be tried except the one 
that has failed so completely." The 
Greens' plan for city development 
focuses 
on 
improving 
neighborhoods. They want to spend 
money immediately to develop low· 
income housing, to improve the parks, 
and to upgrade the public education 
system. 

While the Greens have not coaxed 
the New Haven government to alter its 
policies on city development or Yale's 
tax status, they have succeeded on one 
front: garbage disposal. Every year 
New Haven dumps about 115,000 tons 
of solid waste in a landfill, now almost 
full. 

In August, 
the city 
developed a plan to build a trash 
incinerator in Fair H aven in order to 
reduce the city's solid waste to ash. 
Investigating this method of waste 
disposal, the Green Party and a Fair 
Haven-based group, Don't Dump on 
Us, discovered that many scientists 
question its safety. These scientists 
claim that the burning process releases 
dioxin and other noxious compounds 
into the air. Furthermore, certain 
materials, such as batteries, contain 
heary metals which do not burn; when 
added to a landfill, these metals seep 
into the groundwater, contaminating 
it. During the campaign, the Greens 
demanded that the incinerator not be 
built and that a task force be elected by 
the public to investigate the issue. One 
week after the election, the Mayor 
scrapped the plan, announcing he 
would 
appoint 
a 
task 
force 
to 
investigate. 

On September 29, the task force 
presented its final report at a town 
meeting. The report recommends that 
New Haven initiate recycling and 
composting programs to account for 20 
percent of the waste stream within four 
years, and 'significantly more' after ten 
years. The remainder of the solid 
waste must be burned, a process which 
the report maintains will not be 
dangerous 
if carefully managed. 

Carbone said that city officials have 
been 
negotiating to build the 
incinerator away from New Haven in 
one of two towns, Stratford or Shelton. 
The Greens, however, reject any plan 
involving incineration. They support 
an alternative strategy, formulated by 
Don't Dump on Us, which calls for 
more aggressive recycling to reduce the 
waste stream by 70 percent- the same 
reduction accomplished by burning. 

Greens went to the town meeting 
prepared to counter the task force's 
report. Town meetings can last longer 
than five hours, and after 30 minutes 
this one was already dragging as two 
Greens approached the stand to present 
a skit. One of the men identified his 
partner, wearing a white coat, as a 
distinguished scientist "known for his 
experiments with rats, mice and small 
children." Then the 'scientist,' almost 
shouting into the microphone, outlined 
his 
experiment 
to determine 
toxicity of dioxin. As he spoke, his 
assistant passed out sealed test tubes 
containing a blue liquid to members of 
the task force . The scientist directed 
them to drink the contents. "Please 
keep careful track of the symptoms 
over the next 48 hours. rm especially 
curious to know if the dose proves 
fatal." The assistant added that if the 
incinerator is built, many New Haven 
residents will also have the opportunity 
to participate in the experiment. As the 
crowd laughed and applauded, 
members of the task force exchanged 
angry glances and nervous grins. 

The skit awakened the audience and 
raised an important issue. 

But 
watching it, one had to wonder: for 
whom were they performing? The 
audience, composed mostly of Green 
Party or Don't Dump on Us members, 
already understood the issue and had 
taken a position. Where were the 
uninformed, uninvolved, disaffected 
residents that the Green Party is 
counting on for support? Indeed, some 
doubt that a group of white, educated 
men and women, mostly over 35 years 
old, can appeal to New Haven's voters 
with a radical and idealistic vision that 
often strays from bread-and-butter 
issues. 

The Greens point to other obstacles. 
At the moment, they say, the deck is 
stacked against them. Decades of 
patronage by Democratic admini-
strations have tied whole blocb of 
voters 
to the Democratic Party. 

Furthermore, New Haven residents 
tend to base their votes on a family 
tradition of party affuiation rather than 
on a careful consideration of the issues. 
As a consequence, the Democrats have 
a lock on New Haven politics. There· 
has not been a Republican mayor in 33 
years, and the Board of Aldermen has 
had a Democratic majority for even 
longer. At present, only two of 30 
aldermen are Republicans. 

To overcome these obstacles the 
Green Party seeks to teach New Haven 
voters that they have options and that 
it pays to weigh different political 
strategies. They believe that a.s they 
reach more and more voters with their 
information, the party will receive 
greater support. 

Last year, 
for 
example, the Greens did not fare well 
in predominantly black wards. Their 
explanation for this is that they did not 
run candidates in those wards and 
hence did not get their message across ' 
to those voters. 

Joe Carbone, however, remains 
calm. He feels that the Democrats have 
nothing to fear from the Green Party, 
which he regards as a "flim-flam 
operation." Their success in 
last 
November's elections he attributes to 
the oppos1t1on vote 
which 
any 
incumbent faces. The Greens, he says, 
enjoy a comfortable position in New 
Haven. Because they are not likely to 
gain control of the city government, 
they can remain outside, as critics, 
without being accountable for their 
policies. But even as critics the Greens 
will never carry much influence. "I 
think the Democratic Party will 
continue to dominate New Haven 
politics for at least the remainder of 
our generation," Carbone said. 

Progressive Democrats, though 
closer philosophically to the Greens, 
share Carbone's confidence. Martin 
Dunleavy, majority leader of the New 
Haven Board of Aldermen, agrees 
with the Greens on major issues. He is 
suspicious of the Mayor's development 
plan, and, unlike other Democratic 
aldermen, can back his lip-service to 
the issue of Yale's fmancial obligation 
to New Haven with specific proposals. 
But he is a man who sees no salvation 
outside the party, and hence no hope 
for New Haven's Greens. According to 
Dunleavy, by working as a third party 
the Greens hamper efforts to move the 
Democrats to a progres5ive stance. "To 
say that they're radicalizing New 
Haven politics is hogwash," Dunleavy 
said. He estimates that had certain 
Greens chosen to run as Democrats, he 
would have five more progressives 
voting with him on the Board today. 
But as outsiders, they have no impact. 
"While they're stomping around and 
putting up a lot of posters and making 
noise, I'm passing laws. While tltey're 
screaming, rm voting to change the 
city, and I'd love to have them ~oting 
with me." Dunleavy's traditional 
approach 
to politics, 
based on 
coalitions and compromises, has its 
price: despite his doubts, he has voted 
for every component of the Mayor's 
development package. That is a price 
no Green is willing to pay. 

This fall, 
the Green Party had 
planned to run five candidates for the 
state legislature, because they feel that 
some of their municipal policies- such 
as taxing Yale- would benefit from 
pressure at the state level. But because 
they failed to examine the rules for 
registering new candidates, four of 
their would-be politicans submitted 
their petitions too late to be placed on 
the ballot. Joel Schecter, an Associate 
Professor at the Yale Drama School, 
did register in time. H e is running in 
the 95th district. If elected, he plans to 
work to phase out nuclear power in the 
state, reform New Raven's public 
education system, and create more 
affordable housing through rent 
control. 

Schecter has 
little chance of 
winning. 

Indeed, · the conventional 
political 
wisdom 
in New 
Haven 
suggests that the Greens are unlikely to 
gain a significant number of municipal 
posts 
in 
near future. 

Democrats, at least publicly, write the 
Greens off too easily. Last fall, though 
they had a tiny budget and little time 
to organize, the Greens forced the 
Democrats to respond on a number of 
politically sensitive issues. If the 1985 
campaign is a fair indicator, then the 
Democrats in the future may have to 
move to the left politically to protect 
their constituency from Green Party 
encroachments. The Greens, then, 
find themselves in an ironic position. 
Because they felt stifled within the 
Democratic Party·~ they fonmed a new 
party with a more progressive stance. 
That new party, however, is likely to 
affect New Haven principally through 
its influence on the Democrats. The 
Greens may stimulate the Democratic 
party, make it more open to change 
and possibly shift its stances on 
significant issues, such as increasing 
development in the neighborhoods. 

Though the Greens are unlikely to be 
in a position soon to run the show 
themselves, 
will 
certainly 
continue to make New Haven politics 
livelier, and more democratic. And 
they will certainly continue to have fun 
doing it.
