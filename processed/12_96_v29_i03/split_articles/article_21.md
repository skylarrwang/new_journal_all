The elimination of minority weekend causes Yale's African American 
community to worry about how it will draw future freshmen . 
Missing: Minority Weekend 
A
sha Muldro (DC '97) got on the train in Providence, 
Rhode Island, not sure where she would sleep that night. 
She had been accepted early at Brown and had gone there 
for its minority orientation weekend. But Muldro didn't 
click with Brown. The high school senior quickly packed her things 
and hopped on a train for Yale. She arrived in New Haven, lugging a 
heavy bag and confused about how to get from Union Station to 
campus. She was two days late for Yale's minority weekend, and she 
hadn't even registered. 


By chance, Muldro met a woman also on her way to the Afro-
American Cultural Center, where she 
was scheduled as a panelist over the 
weekend. The woman helped Muldro 
into a cab and got someone to carry her 
bag. Tired from the hectic trip, Muldro 
began to relax. 


When she arrived at the center, 
Muldro still needed a place to stay. What 
happened next surprised her. "All these 
then-freshmen women were like, 'I'll 
host her, I'll host her.' It was like coming 
home." 


T he minority weekend that made 
Muldro feel so welcome, and that 
encouraged her to attend Yale, will not 
convince future minority students of 
Yale's benefits. As of last year, the 
minority pre-frosh days no longer exist. 


Now in her senior year of college, 
Muldro has made herself an 
active member of Yale's African 
American community. She was involved 
in starting the Black Pride Union her 
freshman 
year and 
the 
Black 
Undergraduate Law Association her sophomore year, as well as being 
an ethnic counselor this year. Some people view the black 
community as self-segregating. Muldro's perspective on blacks' place 
at a predominantly white Yale leads her co a different conclusion. 
Many white students, she says, misunderstand that there can be a 
cohesive black community within a larger integrated Yale. 


"I would say there is some self-imposed separation. And I would 
stress the difference between separation and segregation," Muldro 
says. "Segregation is more institutional and rigid, and I can't help 
associating it with the time when there was legal segregation, which 
was recent in this country's history. Separation is much more of a 
natural process for some people." 


Muldro emphasizes that she has chosen the route of social 
separation; she considers her white roommates her friends but 
socializes mostly within the black community. Some African 
American students say they stick together in response to an 
unfriendly white Yale. "You often hear white people talk about the 
black tables [in dining halls], about how many black people live off 
campus," Charlene Flash (MC '98) says. 


"That's by nature of [Yale) just not 
being welcoming. You want to be 
comfortable where you live." 


Flash is not entirely comfortable 
where she lives. College social life does 
not appeal to her. "When residential 
colleges Â· host activities, they cater 
generally to what the white community 
finds entertaining," she says. "The very 
reason Yale even has things like cultural 
centers is because Yale at large is like a 
cultural center 
for 
white 
community, just by nature of its being a 
predominantly white institution." 


Despite the liberalism generally 
embraced at Yale, African Americans 
still experience situations in which they 
feel that Yale's white community judges 
them solely by the color of their skin. 


Keith Horton (JE '97) sometimes 
feels that the community mistrusts him 
for no other reason than him being a 
young black male. This semester he 
asked a white male in Branford College 
for directions to the college's computer lab. The white student 
questioned him rather than answering him flat out. He wanted to 
know whether Horton had been to the computer lab before and 
whether he was familiar with Branford. In Horton's opinion, the 
student was really asking him, "Do you go to Yale?" as if to say he 
looked more like a trespassing New Haven hoodlum. 


Based on small incidents like this one, a collective frustration has 
built in the black community. Only when an incident goes public
