oticing that the old school bus was nearly full, I anxiously 
approached a tall student holding a crumpled list of names 
and asked if there was still room on the bus headed for 
Greenwich, Connecticut. He turned to someone else and 
started speaking rapidly in a foreign language. The conversation that 
ensued did not include me, nor could I understand it. As I realized they 
were speaking German, I became exceedingly conscious of the Jewish 
star that dangled gently from a gold chain around my neck. Finally, the 
man smiled at me and told me in English to go ahead and board the 
bus. As I squeezed past the rows of filled seats, I continued to hear the 
syllables of his foreign tongue. I felt anxious, and frustrated ~ith my 
own anxiety. It was not the people who were making me nervous, but 
the history. 

Several weeks earlier, I had stopped in front of a sign: Hitler's 
WiUing Executioners. The poster was an advertisement for the Scholar's 
Symposium to which I was now headed, as well as the title of the 
recently published doctoral dissertation of Daniel J. Goldhagen, 
assistant professor of government and social studies at Harvard. The 
subject of the Shoah, the Hebrew name for the Holocaust, had always 
drawn me. "Shoah" returns me to my grandmother's room where I sat 
as a ten-year-old girl, giddy with excitement as my grandma removed a 
dusty, worn green album from her dresser. The black-and-white faces 
that looked sternly back at me were beautiful and poised. I tried to find 
in each detail-the nose, the eyes-similarities that I might share with 
my ancestors. But my grandmother could not indulge me. After the 
first page of photos, she began to quickly flip through the rest of the 
album. Confused, I asked her to slow down. "They're all dead," she said 
with no emotion. "Dead." 

Later that day, I told my mom what had happened. Shocked, she 
told me that the album was the only tangible memory my grandmother 
had of her seven brothers and sisters, her parents, and her relatives, all of 
whom had died in the Shoah. My mother had known of the album, 
r8 
and as a girl had often asked my grandmother to look at it, but my 
grandmother had always refused. 

So why had she shown it to me? She seemed to feel a need to do so, 
not realizing how painful the process would be for her. Fifty years later, 
she feels an urgency to tell what happened so her story does not 
disappear with her. I, too, feel a need to search for explanations of the 
Shoah, because I cannot know the people behirid the photographed 
faces. Maybe that's why Goldhagen's title stopped me in my tracks. 

Goldhagen believes the German masses were willing perpetrators. 
Could this really be true? 

Of course they were, the man next to me on the bus claimed in a 
thick German accent. A graduate student at Yale, he recently arrived 
from Germany to study chemistry. He had read Goldhagen's book, 
which attributes the inhumane atrocities of the Shoah to an anti-
Semitism inherent to not only the Nazis and SS leaders, but also the 
common German on the street. Although the graduate student believed 
this hypothesis to be rrue, he was surprised that people had found it 
revelatory. 

The German grad student, however, had never heard a survivor tell 
his story. My elementary school education, on the other hand, is 
marked with vivid memories of Holocaust survivors divulging their 
horrific tales. Of course, he had learned about the Second World War 
and the Holocaust. But he had not heard personal accounts, not from 
his own grandparents and elders who had wimessed the atrocities. Yet 
he still had many of the same pressing questions that I did. He felt a 
disturbed curiosity, a need to understand. 

A
s we entered Temple Shalom, where the symposium was held, I 
spotted a tall, red-headed German srudent. He was Lucz Bemers 
(BK '99), head of Yale's German Club. He had never been in a 
synagogue before, but he had been in close contact with the temple to 
facilitate Yalies' attendance at the symposium.
