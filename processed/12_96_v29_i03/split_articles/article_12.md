The bagel is a staple in the 
lives of many Americans. With 
its sidekick cream cheese, the 
bagel has been combined with 
almost every variety of fruit, 
vegetable, and meat to claim its > 
ground as an all-American; 
favorite. 

However, the bagel was not ~ 
an American creation. Derived ~ 
from 
the Austrian 
wordÂ£ 
"beugel," meaning "stirrup," the ~

original bagel was open at the top like a 
horseshoe. Around the turn of the century, 
it became rounded into the traditional 
donut shape in Eastern Europe. 

The history of the bagel as we know it 
typifies an American success story. And one 
bagel in par~i cular, the Lender's Bagel, 
embodies the dream of Harry Lender. His 
bagel business began in New Haven more 
than 60 years ago. 

A Polish immigrant, Lender arrived in 
this country alone in 1927 with only his 
skills as a baker. The bagel, which had 
arrived before him, was already popular 
among Jewish communities in New 
England. After spending a few years in 
New Jersey, Lender paid $600 for a bread 
bakery on Oak Street, the hub of New 
Haven's Jewish population. He sold bagels 
and other products wholesale. 

Lender's bagel business took off when 
he moved to Baldwin S~reet in New Haven, 
where he made bagels daily in the back 
yard of his home. The business soon 
expanded, taking over the adjacent yard, 
while his family over-flowed into the 
neighboring house. 

Murray, the third Lender child, recalls 
how his entire family was involved rn 
bagel-making. As Murray grew, his bagel 
duties expanded. He began as the official 
bagel counter and then was promoted to 
boiling them. Eventually, Murray was 
allowed to shape the bagels, a task which 
required six to nine months of training. 
After finally graduating to baking, he and 
his brother Marvin took over the family 
business.

In the 1960s, Lender's Bagels achieved 
its modern fame. For the first time, 
bagels were packaged in poly-
ethylene bags and shipped to 
supermarkets across the country. 
Different flavors-
onion, pumpernickel, 
and 
garlic-
were 
introduced. The year 
1962 saw the 
first bagel-a 
Lender's-
shaped by an 
automated machine in 
New Haven. These advances meant that 
every American nationwide had access to a 
Lender's Bagel. The 'bagel boom' was born 
and Lender's Bagels was at the forefront. 

The business continued to expand, so the 
Lender brothers moved their bakery into 
two New Haven factories, which still 
continue to crank out fresh bagels. Despite 
competition from the rising class of 
sophisticated bagel bars, the Lender's Bagel 
flourishes as an American tradition.
