Although Charles Goodyear's name is embossed on millions of tires, his 
invention of vulcanized rubber could not save him from debtor's prison.

t noon the cemetery is not a quiet place. Nor does it 
bristle with the horror of the undead, despite the teen 
thriller admonition "THE DEAD SHALL BE RAISED" 
inscribed on the lintel of the Egyptian revival gates. The 
benches just outside the gates bear trinities of men in plaid, freed 
for an hour from the Law School scaffolding. Inside, people pant 
precipitously, as if he and "Clarissa" have been thrust forward in 
apology, the urchin offspring of the proud monument looming 
behind them. "C.G." and "Clarissa" are none other than the 
inventor and his wife. That Charles and Clarissa are twice 
memorialized perplexes me. My curiosity is piqued. 
in Lycra. It is Indian summer, Lizzie Borden hot. 


"He was"financially strapped," the superintendent of the 
cemetery explains, clicking his tongue behind his teeth 
and giving a slight shake of the head, as if he really 
feels sorry for Charles. Neither of us can figure 
out who paid for the dignified portion of 
the family plot. It is certain that the estate 
of Charles Goodyear, inventor of 
vulcanized rubber, could not have 
managed much more than a pair of 
shrinking violets of the "Clarissa" 
and "C.G. " va'riety. Upon his 
death, Charles owed $200,000 in 
1860 money. 
I turn right on Sycamore Avenue and walk 
almost to the end. Plot 46. My distant cousin 
Charles, an inventor, is buried here with his 
first wife and five children. My great-great-
great-great-great-great-grandfather was 
his great-grandfather. I have been here 
many times before, more out of 
curiosity t han excessive ancestor · 
worship. 
Plot 46 is elevated a bit, set off 
from its neighbors by a low wall. A 
three-step stairway, framed by 
granite parentheses, fans from an 
opening in the wall. Something in 
the gesture of the paren theses 
offends me. It alleges to include 
the passerby, to invite trespass, but 
serves to dismiss like the flip of a 
wrist. I step over the wall in protest 
of the stairway's snobbery. 
Smack dab in the middle of the 
plot is the austere gray monument to 
Charles. Its countenance is too serious, 
just this side of laconic. T he lettering of 
our shared surname is four inches high. 
Born New Haven, 1800. Died New York, 
1860. The south face of the block remembers his 
first wife, Clarissa; the east face is dedicated to his 
children, and the north to his second wife, the nubile 
Fanny. There are other graves scattered in the plot, one unmarked, 
another assigned to a mysterious Agnes. 

But two are of greater interest to me, gravestones worn down 
to a dental white, side by side. "C.G." says the one, "Clarissa" the 
other. Both are washed out, marked up, modest. "C.G." tilts 
I wonder if the city of New 
Haven sprang for the monument. 
Or perhaps one of his more 
magnanimous creditors felt pangs 
of remorse for this martyr to 
manufacturing. Maybe the Grove 
Street Cemetery contributed in 
exchange for the privilege of 
counting C harles among its 
Chronicle of Eminmt People buried 
there. 

P
oor Charles was not so lucky in life 
as he was in death. Had only such 
generosity been extended in his 
lifetime, Charles' tale would be a more cheerful 
one. Suffering like Job, a figure with whom he 
deeply identified, Charles labored toward the realization of 
his vision: stabilized India rubber. To · this end he endured great 
poverty, brought his family to the brink of starvation, and spent 
more than one night in debtor's prison. His cousin-biographer 
Grace casts his struggle in heroic terms: "In the heart of this sickly, 
small, sallow, nervous man there was the white fire of high resolve, 
noble purpose, self sacrifice, and lofty 
fortitude that illumines the lives of the greatest 
on earth." 

Whatever else he may have been, it is fair to say 
that Charles was obsessed with rubber. In 1831, 
India rubber came to North America from South America in the 
form of rubber shoes. The New England factories quickly took up 
its manufacture. Charles got the rubber bee in his bonnet in 1834 
when, desperate for income, he went to the Roxbury Rubber 
Company with an improved design for a life vest valve. Mr. 
Roxbury told him that if he wanted to make his mark on the 
rubber products industry, he should forget valve design and turn 
his mind to the rubber itself. The problem was that the damn stuff 
wouldn't stay put: it melted in the summer and snapped in the 
winter. Wishing him luck with the fickle substance, Roxbury 
slapped Charles on the back and bid him Godspeed. Charles was 
arrested and detained in debtor's prison on the way home. 

Throughout the 1830s Charles experimented tirelessly, relying 
on the advances of friends and speculators, living hand to mouth 
in cramped attic spaces and the back rooms of chemists' shops. He 
combined, with various success, India rubber gum with magnesia, 
lime, and bron.ze. Some of these concoctions were patented, 
winning him marginal acclaim. He transformed Clarissa's silk 
undergarments into rain hats and mailed President Andrew 
Jackson a rubber letter. But extremities of hot and cold still 
reduced his work to nothing, and Charles' straits remained pretty 
dire. He bartered rubber trinkets for bread. He pawned most of the 
family furniture. 

Charles was serious and dedicated, quiet though keen of 
purpose. As a youth growing up in New Haven, he had hoped to 
become a minister. But his father Amasa, also an inventor, 
apprenticed Charles in his factory and steered him toward 
industry. 

Nineteenth-century New Haven bustled with savvy young 
entrepreneurs. But Charles never quite mastered the well-timed 
ruthlessness required of his profession. Instead, he approached his 
quest for stable rubber with a religious zeal. It was his calling. 
The goal of his pilgrimage proved an elusive one. Like Charles 
himself, India rubber was both frail and durable; it teetered 
between states as precariously as his fortunes. Its abilities as a 
modern material were variously praised and belittled. Likewise, 
those from whom b' 
Charles sought financial 
backing for his experiments both 
exalted him as a genius and derided 
him as a lunatic. 

T
he pinnacle of Charles' career, the happy accident for which 
he is famous, the reason that my last name is as familiar as 
Kleenex, happened one winter evening in 1839. I imagine 
it occurred in the place now occupied by Jonathan Edwards 
College, his humble little house. It stood on the corner of High 
and Library Streets, now the path separating Jonathan Edwards 
and Branford Colleges, light from its thinly curtained windows 
making shallow incursions against the black of a night without 
street lamps. From Library Street an icy path led to the house's 
kitchen door. From without, the pitch and fall of a heated 
conversation could be heard. 
"But can't you see, my boy, that it's precisely the nitric acid 
which consumtf-" 
"No, no, I see, but I disagree. I say that it is rather the process 
of boiling the gum which renders it less viscous!" 
"Please, Charles, dear gentlemen, I beg your pardon, might the 
discussion not better be held in the sitting room? Or perhaps after 
supper? Gentlemen, would you stay for supper?" Clarissa turned 
her flushed face toward the group clustered around the butcher's 
block, where she was hoping to roll out her dough, and then 
quickly resumed the posture of gazing into the watery soup. She 
knew they would have the decency to decline. 

For dinner that night there would be boiled potato soup and 
bread. Charles always liked his bread a spot fried. Besides, he was 
looking pale; a little fried bread and a bowl of soup would take the 
chill from his bones. She wished his damn fool brothers and the 
others would just leave him be. 

Clarissa opened the window to the blustery February night. 
The men looked up at the sudden cold, aware of an interruption, 
but they continued their conversation nevertheless. Charles 
nodded as if to say, "soon dear." Clarissa lit the pilot light below 
the griddle. 
"Gentlemen. The patent I have obtained from Mr. Hayward, 
the one for sulfur treatment shows great potential- the mailbags 
were only a minor setback-"
