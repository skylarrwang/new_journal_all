**To Walk a Mile in Another Man's Shoes**

"There's not too much to tell," says 
Frank Purpora from behind a dusty 
showcase filled with dented cartons of shoe 
laces, responding to niy request to discuS's 
his "chariry work." 

Purpora points me toward a typed letter 
tacked to the store wall among posters 
advertising various New Haven communiry 
events. 

Written by the program coordinator at 
the New Haven Homeless Resource Center, 
the letter reads: 

"Thank you so much for the rescue of 
our program participant who had no shoes 
fit to wear on his feet ... Just the other day, 
the young man walked inside the Resource 
Center with i: happy smile on his face. He 
looked down at his feet, shook his legs, as if 
to start dancing. He was so proud of 
wearing newer shoes and re-thanked me for 
bringing him to your shop." 

Every so often, Purpora says, someone 
who is down on his luck will come into the 
shop looking for an old pair of shoes. If 
Purpora happens to have a pair of 
unclaimed shoes in that person's size, he 
gives them away. 

Star Shoe Repair, across from the 
Shubert on College Street, is cluttered but 
clean. Leather bags of various shapes and 
sizes overlap on a rack behind the counter. 
Odors of leather and shoe 
polish give a pleasant, 
pungent bite to the air. The 
sound of a hammer against leather comes 
from the store's back room, punctuating 
Purpora's speech. 

A customer walks into the shop, and 
Purpora chats with him while filling his 
order. Now that classes have begun at Yale, 
he says, the shoes are tumbling in. He can 
hardly keep up with the business. 

The phone rings and Purpora asks 
Jimmy James, his lone assistant, to answer it. 
"There used to be five of us here," Purpora 
says. Now it is just James and himself. 
"We're doing the best we can. There's not 
too many fellas who want to go into the 
business. You've got to get your hands dirty." 

He smiles and shows his hands, which are 
calloused and smeared with black shoe 
polish. 

Many repair businesses like tailors and 
dry cleaners, Purpora says, amass a 
collection of forgotten properry. Although 
his claim tickets say customers must pick up 
their shoes within 30 days, Purpora's 
customers sometimes lose track of time or 
move away, leaving their belongings behind. 

Rather than discarding unclaimed shoes, 
Purpora tries "to do a good thing" by giving 
them away to a needy person. He estimates 
that he's distributed eight or ten pairs this 
year. 

It can be risky chariry to give old shoes 
away. Occasionally, a delinquent customer 
has shown up several months after he left his 
shoes, only to find that they are on someone 
else's feet. "I've got to be really careful to 
make sure I only give the really old ones 
away," Purpora says. 

Although Purpora does not usually seek 
out needy people, he gave his first pair of 
boots away 20 years ago to a woman he saw 
wearing a pair of Birkenstocks in the 
wintertime. Now, he says, the woman is in 
her late thirties, has a Ph.D., and is a regular 
customer. 

"I really didn't do it for publicity," 
Purpora says with a shy smile. As the old 
aphorism goes, happiness is a 
comfortable pair of shoes.
