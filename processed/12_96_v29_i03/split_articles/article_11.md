With its small failures and great 
successes, patient cadences and frantic 
rushes, fishing lends itself to casual 
metaphors. Anyone who's seen A River 
Runs Through It knows that fishing is 
supposed to be a lot like life. But some 
skeptics may have difficulty seeing the 
connection between pulling a fish out of 
water and human existence. 

Last spring, when James Prosek (BR 
'97) and Joe Furia (PC '00) conceived the 
idea of a fishing journal at Yale, they 
wanted to capture the spiritual quality of 
fishing without lapsing into cliches. At the 
time, Furia was a high school senior 
visiting Yale as a pre-frosh. His cousin, 
Franny Furia (BR '97), put him in touch 
with Prosek, aware of their mutual passion 
for fishing. During one of the 
classes Furia visited, Prosek 
passed Furia a note asking, 
"What do you think of starting 
a literary fishing journal at 
Yale?" 

The end result of that piece 
of scrap paper is the Yale 
Anglers' journa4 a collection of 
fourteen short essays focused on 
angling. With some help from 
psychology professor Nelson 
Donnegan, Furia and Prosek 
produce and edit the journal, 
which brings together an 
impressive range of amateur 
angler-au tho rs-i ncludi ng 
former Attorney General Elliot 
Richardson, a family friend of 
Furia. Furia and Donnegan 
each wrote essays and Aaron 
Kennon (CC '97) contributed a 
piece, but most of the authors 
are friends of Furia or Prosek 
from outside of Yale-what 
Prosek calls "non-Yanglers." 

The journal also contains 
excerpted sections from two 
recent books about fishing: 
Wade a Little Duper, Dear and 
DECEMBER 6, 1996 
A Different Angle. Furia did most of the 
leg-work for the journal, completing the 
entire journal before he carne to Yale for his 
freshman year. He arranged the excerpts 
with the publishing companies, worked on 
the editing process with the authors, 
arranged for Kinko's to print the journal, 
and did all the graphic and layout work. 

Furia says all of the pieces are about 
"life, told through fishing" and the 
editorial aspect of the magazine succeeds in 
that focus. The pieces are all short (the 
longest runs about 2,000 words), each one 
exploring a particular theme or element 
involved in angling. Each essay is 
accompanied by a graphic that corresponds 
roughly to the piece's theme. The graphics 
are gleaned from fishing books that are 
over 70 years old, to avoid copyright laws. 

While the antiquated look of the graphics 
is in keeping with the classical feel of the 
journal itself, more recent pictures might 
lend the journal a more exciting feel. 

The intended audience for the journal 
is mostly Yale alumni and other anglers 
outside of New Haven, rather than current 
Yalies. While the journal is available at the 
Co-op, most of the initial print run of 500 
will hopefully be distributed through the 
mail to interested anglers. If all goes well, 
contributions from these readers will help 
finance future editions of the journal and 
reimburse Furia, Prosek, and Donnegan for 
their backing of the first issue. 

Right now Furia and Prosek plan to 
publish the journal semi-annually. Their 
wish-list of possible contributors for this 
spring includes New York Times editorial 
page editor Howell Raines and George 
Bush (DC '48) . With Prosek set to 
graduate in the spring, the 
journal is seeking more Yalies 
with a passion for fishing and a 
literary bent. In his introductory 
note at the beginning of the 
journal, Prosek presents his 
ultimate utopian goals for the 
journal and for angling at Yale: a 
Yale Angling Library and a trout 
scream running through the 
Branford courtyard. After 
reading the journal, these 
ventures begin to seem pretty 
worthwhile.
