EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Having read Goldhagen's work, Berners arrived both skeptical and 
curious. In Germany he had been taught about the Shoah in a factual 
manner. "My teacher tried not to evoke too much emotion, and dealt 
with [the Shoah] as a topic of history ... with an explicit warning: 'You 
see the numbers ... '" 


Inside the temple, a power outage intensified the evening's drama. 
The halls, aisles, and beema, or stage, were lit by small white candles. I 
shuddered, t:hi$ng that 50 years ago, Jews had crouched down hiding 
in dark attics and corridors, guided by the candlelight. Now, in this 
same light, we would attempt to better undersrand that past. 


Rabbi R. Lennick emerged from the darkness. His figure, 
illuminated by a soijrary beam of light, cast a shadow on the Torah ark 
behind him. Both this single lamp and the microphone from which he 
welcomed us were powered by a generator. Ironically, the generator was 
from Berlin, Connecticut. 


The evening's two speakers stepped out of the shadows. Yale 
English and Comparative Literature Professor Geoffrey Hartman 
(GRD '53), a scholarly figure with a sweeping white beard and equally 
sweep4tg portfolio of renowned works, had been invited to challenge 
Goldhagen's controversial thesis. When Goldhagen addressed the 
audience, I was impressed by his calm and collected demeanor. He 
defended his book's charge that the German population of the Third 
Reich was not onJy fully conscious but also enthusiastic and proud of its 
involvement in the Shoah. 


Hartman respects the force with which Goldhagen represents and 
interprets the past. Goldhagen strives to understand and explain the 
why rather than the hfJW of the Shoah. Previously, Hartman stated, the 
inhumane aCts were justified as obedience to an oppressive authority. 
Researchers attempted to discover how mankind could commit such 
atrocities, focusing on the psychology of human nature. But Goldhagen 
argues that the why is more obvious than people want to admit; anti-
Semitism was intrinsic in the German nature. 


DECEMBER 6, 1996 
Goldhagen's descriptions of the voluntary cruelty stunned me. He ~ 
described how Police Battalion 101 rook pictures of the brutal !l 
roundups and jubilantly mailed them to lovers and wives. He attributes :? 
this participation to an "eliminationist anti-Semitism." Goldhagen ~ 
asserted that this sentiment had always been present among the .g 
Germans. All that was necessary was a vehicle through which to vent it, ~ 
which appeared with the Nazis' "Final Solution." The Germans, ;j 
~ 
Goldhagen asserts, jumped at the opportunity to prove themselves just ~ 
and courageous individuals; the genocide was viewed as a personal test ~ 
of the German soul. Their actions were not done forcedly, but eagerly.

While his writings are disturbingly graphic, Goldhagen insisted that ~ 
they are not produCts of anger. He argued that throughout his endeavor, 
he maintained emotional disrance and presented only a political and 
intellecrual analysis based on facts. His vivid descriptions, he explained, 
are necessary to put the reader in the perpetrators' shoes. Furthermore, 
he was not intellectually shocked with his findings. Recently, in Rwanda 
and Yugoslavia, brutal slayers were believed to have thought that what 
they were doing was right. Why, then, would the Germans have 
believed differently? 


Berners agrees. When he initially read Goldhagen's book prior to 
the symposium, he initially believed that the work was written in anger. 
The symposium converted his views. "Seeing him speak, and the way 
he spoke, gave me a positive impression. It is a book that seeks 
understanding, and not provocation," he said. Berners is not alone. 
Dana Schwerdt (ES '00), a German-Jewish student who irnmigrated 
with her family to the United States, recalls: "My whole family read 
[Goldhagen's] book together, and we all felt that there was no revelation 
behind the book." 


The support that Goldhagen received from the German youth on 
his recent book tour shocked media and critics. While the German 
scholars with whom Goldhagen shared the stage were highly critical of 
his work, the predominantly young German audience accepted and
