It does not take long at Yale before it becomes obvious to the entire Yale community that race is still a divisive force on campus. The most vivid example occurred in 1990 when employees at Naples Pizza kicked out eight black students. The employees claimed that the students were overly intoxicated. An altercation ensued, in which the students allege the employees used racial slurs. Black students launched a major boycott of the restaurant. Some continue it to this day.

Controversy erupted again this October when Glee Club director David Connell chose "My Old Kentucky Home," a 19th century song containing the word "darkies," for a performance to be given at the Bard College Festival of Music. The two African American Glee Club members refused to sing the song. They found "darkies" insulting because it hearkened back to days of black slavery and legal subjugation.

Yale has failed to erase the traces of its oppressive past. Though they are subtle, the vestiges remain. Flash notes that Calhoun College is named after one of the major defenders of slavery. To her, use of the word "master" is uncomfortably evocative. More direct is a painting hanging in the Berkeley College dining hall that portrays a black female slave with a silver collar around her neck. Similarly, in Woodbridge Hall a portrait of Elihu Yale with a chained slave kneeling before him hangs in the Yale Corporation's boardroom.


It is against this backdrop of ignorance and insensitivity that the disappearance of minority weekend has caused deep concern. Activities geared specifically to minority students now take place at the general pre-frosh weekend: Director of Minority Recruitment Robert Jackson explains that the university's main reason for eliminating the separate minority weekend is that it misrepresents Yale. "You basically had segregated programs before," he says. "Yale is composed of many types of people."

Though some African American students echo his views, many feel they needed the initial support that minority weekend provided. They needed to know that there is a strong network of black people at Yale. Muldro and Horton both formed their first good friendships at Yale during the few days they spent here as seniors in high school. Horton gives minority weekend much credit for his decision to attend the university and is disappointed that it didn't happen last year. "When they got rid of minority weekend, they got rid of one of the most effective measures to ensure that [minority] students attend Yale."

The decline in African American enrollment for the Class of 2000, a drop to 7 percent from the previous year's 7.4 percent, suggests that Keith may be right. This is amidst an already disturbing trend in which black freshman enrollment has decreased each year since 1993. Muldro's and Horton's class was 11.5 percent African American, the highest percentage in Yale's history. It is not that Yale is accepting fewer African Americans-Jackson says acceptances have remained relatively steady-it is that fewer are deciding to attend. Yale's black students say insensitivity on campus discourages prospective African Americans. Minority weekend was an opportunity for prospective blacks to find support before integrating into the larger campus community. Without such a weekend, many blacks feel they would not have been aware that such a community exists, and they might have chosen to go to a school where one is more apparent.

The Annual Black Solidarity Conference began at Yale last year, not in direct response to the cancellation of minority weekend or specific events on campus, but in an effort to mobilize and unify blacks nationwide. This year's conference, entitled "Empowerment 2000: Building Black Leadership for the 21st Century," drew Yale undergraduates, alumni, and students from colleges nationwide. They gathered in part to discuss the recent surge in public hostility toward affirmative action that threatens their community.


The people who gathered at the conference found it necessary to assert themselves collectively as blacks. In doing so, they claim for themselves an identity distinct from the white community. Theirs is a positive, pro-active self-separation. This is the strong group of African Americans whom, without minority weekend, prospective freshmen may never see.
