I
t is difficult to forget the label branding a doorway on the third 
floor of University Health Services (UHS): a plaque with white 
letters screaming "MENTAL HYGIENE." For Sandra, walking 
through those doors was always disconcerting. Even in the waiting 
room, she did not feel at ease. Sitting in a brown vinyl chair perusing a 
painfully out-of-date N~ Yorktr, Sandra once saw an acquaintance 
enter the room. They glanced at each other and smiled self-consciously, 
but neither of them felt comfortable enough to say hello. 

When Ken went to Mental Hygiene for his initial appointment, he 
stepped into the elevator, intending to get off at the third floor and turn 
left. As the elevator doors slid closed, a hand slipped between them and 
in walked Ken's residential college dean. Ken turned right instead of left 
when the elevator reached the third floor, pretending to head towards 
Undergraduate Medicine and away ftom Mental Hygiene. "My dean is 
just not the kind of person you would want to know about your mental 
health," Ken says with an ironic smile. 

Alexis describes walking throughÂ· the Mental Hygiene doors as 
unnerving. But with a year of Mental Hygiene experience under her 
belt, Alexis does things differendy. "There's actually a door that you can 
go in through the stairs, so that you don't have to take the elevator, and 
you can go right into the office," Alexis says, clearly excited. Ken also 
speaks of the back entrance, which he calls "the secret door." Ken found 
the secret door in time for his first therapy session, a few weeks after 
dodging his college dean and avoiding the entrance that says "Mental 
Hygiene." 

Unfortunately, I never realized the secret door existed. Had I 
known, I might have used it as a sophomore when I approached 
Mental Hygiene after a year of anorexic behavior. I can now look back 
and say that Mental Hygiene did a fine job of providing me a therapist 
and showing me how to cope with eating at Yale amidst endless trays of 
soylada and fishburgers. I liked my therapist's quiet, sympathetic 
manner from the start. Once a week I went to her small, warm office, 
which glowed with brownish light and boasted exotic-looking 
knickknacks. At the beginning of each meeting she asked me how I was 
doing and listened quiedy. Sometimes she spoke only a few sentences in 
the entire 50 minutes we sat in her office. By the end of the session, my 
eyes were often blurry from the dim lighting, and I could barely discern 
the therapist's oudine from the wall behind her. But I would emerge 
from the office feeling fresher and looking forward to the next week. 

Yet the sense of embarrassment never disappeared from my visits to 
Mental Health Services. Two years later, I am more comfortable 
confessing that I had an eating disorder than admitting that I went to 
Mental Hygiene. Each time I walked through the department's doors I 
felt ashamed, weak, and scared that someone might recognize me. The 
stigma attached to Mental Hygiene may stem from beyond the walls of 
UHS-from the public's preconceptions about what it means to use 
psychotherapy-but the often institutional and mechanical nature of 
Mental Hygiene only accentuates this stigma. Inside the department's 
doors, students find comfort in the willing ears of their therapists. 
However, they also find a process that erases their privacy and treats 
them with the personality of an automaton. 

M
ental Hygiene: the name itself is sterile, hardly inviting. 
Walking through the department's doors, I felt as though I 
was going to the dentist, as if I would emerge 50 minutes 
later with my brain polished and whitened. The name holds unlimited 
promise-go in for a quick check-up and come out with a perfecdy 
flossed brain-but it also gives the impression that anyone entering the 
department has a mind in need of fixing. 

The term "mental hygiene" became popular in the 1920s, during 
the era of Sigmund Freud. & Freud's writings made their way into 
mainstream culture, Yale established its mental health department, 
explains Dr. Lorraine Siggins, acting director of Mental Health 
Services. Her voiee boasts an Australian accent, tinged with a hint of 
conservatism that her sweater suit confirms. During her 30 years here 
she has wimessed the transformation from all-male to co-ed Yale, and 
the comings and goings of countless students. 

Each year, about 1,000 students, graduate and undergraduate, 
come to Mental Hygiene. The plaque on the entrance is only the first 
indication of Mental Hygiene's institutional nature. Studenrs 
undergoing therapy often feel like products of an out-of-dare machine. 
Lengthy waiting periods for appointments and inaccessible services do 
nothing to overcome the stigma that already surrounds psychotherapy. 
If anything, Mental Hygiene reinforces the stigma with its awkward 
approach to highly personal concerns. Siggins, fop example, uses 
bureaucratic language to describe student problems. She hesitates to 
categorize some problems as "more serious" than others. Instead, she 
terms conditions such as manic depression "more traditional psychiatric 
illnesses." 

L
ike many students, Alexis was hesitant to approach Mental 
Hygiene. "I have trouble admitting that I have weaknesses in 
general," says Alexis, a sophomore. Her words imply that using 
Mental Hygiene signals a "weakness," though Alexis hardly seems weak. 
Lounging on her bed, she speaks indifferently, as though recounting a 
weekend of beer-guzzling rather than a semester of group therapy for

For some, "the secret tkJor" is the only anonymous, and therefore comfortable, way to approach Mental Hygiene at University Health Services. 

an eating disorder. But Alexis tells few people about her weekly visits to 
Mental Hygiene. 

Ken, a senior, also hesitates to reveal his use of Mental Hygiene, 
even though the issues that brought him there seem typical of college 
students. Ken exudes an intelleCtual air and speaks in modulated tones. 
"I have difficulty finding spaces here to contain psychological issues," 
Ken says. He then translates this into layman's terms: "I wanted a place 
where I could talk about things, a space where they exist separate from 
my everyday life." 

Ken claims not to feel ashamed about his visits to Mental Hygiene. 
Yet his eyes wander around the room rapidly, his cheeks darken a shade, 
and his voice rises as he explains that people would misinterpret the 
situation if they discovered he goes to Mental Hygiene. "I don't have 
the time to deal with people's crap about the shit they give you for why 
you are going," he says. His voice changed drastically from the 
measured tones of a few minutes earlier. "It will be calked about, it will 
come up in drunken conversation. It will fuck up your relationship 
with going to Mental Hygiene. Because of the rumor mills and because 
of people talking about it-not because it's a secret." 

H
oused in the gray concrete slab of UHS, Mental Hygiene 
emanates an impersonal air. Irs offices are mechanically 
arranged for comfort; a steady flow of students file in, each 
ready to undergo the weekly inspection. Stu~.:nts may then find

themselves passed along to different therapists like machine parts in an 
assembly line. Going to Mental Hygiene reminded me of punching a 
rime dock; 50 minutes after entering the office, I had done my work 
for the week. When I left Yale for vacation, I felt as though I had 
emerged from the Mental Hygiene machine-inspected, stamped, and 
ready to proceed with my Yale career. 

Despite the mechanical attributes of Mental Hygiene, the process 
fails to run like a well-oiled machine. The machinery may break down 
before a student even enters the Mental Hygiene doors. Sandra called 
the department at the beginning of her second semester at Yale, when 
she found herself in a state of depression. "When I first called Mental 
Hygiene, it was discouraging," Sandra says. "The guy who answered 
the phone said, 'Our demand is so high-you have got to understand 
that we're all very busy and we can't accommodate requests."' 

Sandra felt lucky co be allotted even 50 minutes of Mental 
Hygiene's time. "I understand they have very limited resources. In some 
way I felt I was not bad off enough to deserve their time," she says. 

'' 
T
hey told me they would call me within two weeks after my 
intake, which was a total lie," Ken says, dearly disgusted. 
The intake appointment is intended as a diagnostic 
consultation, to be quickly followed by a session with an assigned 
therapist. Instead of the purported two-week waiting period, students 
who don't call at the beginning of the semester, like Ken, may face a
