**Title: Vision 2000: Growth strategies tailored to today's burgeoning undergraduate marketplace**
**Author: Alec Bemis**
**Page number(s): 23**

Good afternoon. Welcome to the 1996 Yale University Stockholders Meeting.

The first section of tonight's presentation features one of the more exciting developments in our undergraduate profile: the rejuvenation of the Yale Business and Economics Forum (YBE). Celebrating 25 years as an established undergraduate extracurricular sub-discipline, the YBE has obliterated its former image as an irrelevant group created for padding the resumes of future CEOs and upper-echelon management personnel.

In the fall quarter, the YBE developed into a dynamic voice for those interested in business fields. Once a sidebar domain to our standard post-baccalaureate industries-medicine, law, politics-business-related fields have exploded in the past decade. As the number of students fascinated by the diverse challenges offered in global careers in management consulting, international banking, and other corporate ventures has skyrocketed, a vital, new organization has arisen to satisfy the diverse needs of this market.

The numbers are in. In less than three months' time, the YBE's unpaid student yield has skyrocketed from 10 to 270-an increase of 2,600 percent. Factor in the newly instituted membership fee of $10 and the paid yield of 110 student units, and you can see that the gross income in this division has surpassed all expectations. But how has the YBE coped with the other movers and shakers in today's competitive Student life marketplace? To answer that question, I introduce the man responsible for this bold new direction: YBE Chairman David C. Bilas.

"I had a three-prong plan for revitalizing the group, because it was doing terribly. We had a membership of ten people last year. So I had a few goals I wanted to hit, and it looks like it's worked out pretty well."

Tell the stockholders how you accomplished your objective and turned this loss leader around.

"First thing we needed to do is we needed a product people would want to see. So last spring I went on a pretty massive letter writing campaign just to generate some guests to come. We weren't expecting a very good success rate; we were expecting a pretty low success. But as it turned out our success was much higher, and we actually weren't able to bring in all the people who wanted to come because we just couldn't fit it in the schedule.

"Second thing we needed to do was generate membership. We had the product so we changed our marketing approach. We wanted to expose the group's name a lot more so I tried to figure out how we could market the group better. We did simple things like a web page-little things that were never done before which seem so obvious-like table tenting, better postering. We tried to create a brand new image. I tried to come up with some kind of logo-something recognizable like the Political Union has. That worked out.

"Then we needed the revenue. So I decided to charge membership. I was the first chairman to ever do that in the history of the group, and it worked out pretty well. I thought we had a product that people would be willing to pay for. We wanted to be able to compete with the Political Union, who as it turned out actually didn't end up having a good schedule this year, so we felt we had to undercut them a little bit-our entry strategy. So we charged ten bucks. We knew they charged $15 so we figured that might be attractive given our schedule."

How do you deal with the challenges of an expanding, global marketplace?

"We're building up membership in SOM right now. We're doing a pretty aggressive campaign there to get graduate students involved."

This type of visionary leadership brought Yale University to the pinnacle of America's college ratings this year and continues to keep Yale ahead in the burgeoning job market.

After all this good news, I know you will be disheartened to hear the addendum to this report of rising profits: the chairman is graduating in the second quarter of 1997.

However, the YBE is confident that it will continue to make the innovative management decisions which have brought it newfound popularity among undergraduates. And in case you are still concerned about the impending change, we have been assured that Chairman Bilas is committed to aiding in the transition to a new management team.

Before closing off this meeting, however, I would like to report that we believe Chairman Bilas' future endeavors will one day bring returns to the Yale Corporation.

"I'm looking into consulting, I-banking-the obvious things. Also places like Proctor and Gamble. And I'm also trying to maybe work at some of the companies of the CEOs whom I've invited."

A great list, I assure you: Raymond Smith, CEO of Bell Atlantic; Kenneth Wolfe, CEO of Hershey's Foods; Leonard Lauder, CEO of Estee Lauder; John F. Smith Jr., CEO of General Motors; and Gordon Bethune, CEO of Continental Airlines.

"Some of them seem kind of interesting to me so I might want to go into that-some kind of smaller, non-conventional type of job."
