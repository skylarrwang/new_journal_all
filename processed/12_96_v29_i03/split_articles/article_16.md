1as to reimburse his increasingly impatient 
reditors. It was denied him on a 
echnicality. Charles was escorted off to 
:lichy Prison. His son delivered the Cross 
f the Legion of Honor to him in his cell. 
This was the last ironic twist of fate for 
he beleaguered Charles. His few remaining 
ears dissolved in unhappiness: he returned 
::> England, Clarissa died, and Charles was 
1iled for his exhibition debts. A second 
narriage to young Fanny Wardell in 1854 
nay have provided a momentary bright 
pot, but marital bliss was soon 
Â·vershadowed by the illness of his daughter. 
)espite his own failing health, Charles 
lecided to return to New Haven to be at his 
laughter's bedside. He died on his way 
here. 

The turn of the century brought cars, 
nd the beginning of the end of obscurity 
or the Goodyear name. Exactly how the tire 
ompany adopted the name is uncertain. In 
II likelihood it was purchased along with 
he patent. There is a detectable wince when 
family historian writes, "No Goodyear has 
ver held an important position in the 
;oodyear Rubber Company." I suppose it 
;ails some Goodyears to be a household 
.tame only by proxy, and the wounds of 
:harles' hard luck are thus never allowed to 
lose. 

noon the cemetery is not a quiet 
ace. The streets coursing by its 
tes and running alongside its high 
valls are thick ~ith traffic. But inside, 
:harles' grave is silent and stately. Not even 
be smaller gravestone, suggestive in its 
nodesty, tells his complete story. Standing 
here, I hear car after car go by, tires 
budding against the road in their endless 
evolutions. Charles never knew the full 
amifications of his discovery, through the 
nillions of tires embossed with my cousin's 
tame are reminders of his achievement. But 
cannot conceive of a memorial more fitting 
han 
the 
Goodyear 
blimp. 
That 
nonumental silver balloon, hovering in the 
teavens, iridescent with sun, bears witness 
o the strange apotheosis his cousin Grace 
xpected of him. It fulfills the promise of the 
:;rove Street Cemetery gates.
