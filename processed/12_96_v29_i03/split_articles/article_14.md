Yale students discover that donating sperm is not.

D 
uring his freshman and sophomore years, David made 40 
trips to the Sperm Physiology Lab at Yale Medical School 
to masturbate into a plastic cup. For most students, work-
study involves mundane tasks, but David, now a junior, veered 
from the beaten path of student employment: he donated sperm. 
"Donation," however, is a misnomer. At the end of the 12 to 15 
week "donating" process, he collected a check for $2,000. Two 
years later, he has probably fathered four or five children whom 
he'll never know. 

On his first visit, a doctor handed David a "specimen cup" and 
pointed to a drawer that contained a thick manila folder full of 
Pmthouse and Playboy magazines. Carrying his plastic cup and 
manila folder, David walked past labs and offices to the public 
bathroom at the end of the hallway. His journey was not a private 
one; eyes from neighboring offices and labs turned to watch him 
as though he were a sperm model strolling down the reproductive 
catwalk. 

The bathro.om was a little cramped, but nothing special. 
Certainly not conducive to fantasy. David walked in, locked the 
door, sat on the cold, impersonal toilet, and commenced his work. 
"It was miserable," he says, laughing nervously. "People kept 
knocking and I was like, 'C'mon, you know what I'm doing in 
here.' The forced environment makes it very impersonal, makes it 
a job and makes it ... truly difficult." 

Scott, who also donated sperm his freshman and sophomore 
years, found the initial experience disconcerting. "I was really 
nervous and uncomfortable, I felt disgusting and dirry and self-
conscious," Scott says. ''I'm not like a lot of guys who can just do 
it standing up or sitting on the toilet." So he took newspapers 
with him to the bathroom, lined the tiles, and laid on the floor. 
On his make-shift newspaper bed, Scott closed his eyes and 
transported himself into a world of fantasy. "I had to block 
everything out. Otherwise, it just completely turned me off. 
Completely," he says emphatically. Several times, just when he 
began to forget that he was lying on the cold floor of a laboratory 
bathroom, people would knock on the door or try to enter. "It 
would bring you back to realiry and you couldn't shout, 'Hey, I'm

donating, leave me alone!'" He'd have to start from scratch again. 

With experience, the process became less arduous. "It's almost 
like you're watching a movie of someone else doing this," Scott 
says. In retrospect, he finds the procedure humorous and surreal. 
"It's not like I don't have respect for human life or the whole 
process of fertilization, but partially I did it because it's funny. I 
mean, I'm a sperm donor," he laughs. "The end is kind of pleasant. 
When it's all over you have this heroic feeling, like, 'I did it.'" 

Scott was in and out of the miserable bathroom within five or 
ten minutes. If you calculate his earnings per hour, he made a 
killing. If you calculate by the sperm, he wasn't making much. But 
then, what are billions of sperm to a man in his sexual peak? 
Actually, donors do face sacrifices. They are re·quired to abstain 
the day before and the day of donation. Scott was not draconian 
about abstaining. "Whatever. I'm a teenage guy ... " 

Even so, David says, "It was the kind of job you hated, but it 
made no sense to quit. Each time I went in, I thought, 'Ugh, this 
stinks,' but each time I was getting $50 more, and that's a lot of 
money. So I stuck with it and finished my 'term' and now I'm 
$2,000 richer." 

r. Gabor Huszar's phone rings, the fax machine spits out 
pages, and colleagues come in to grab fertility journals. It 
comes as no surprise that his expertise· is in such high 
demand; he was one of the founding directors of Yale's fertility 
program in 1983, and he remains at the forefront of developments 
in reproductive treatment. Huszar says reproductive technology 
has been revolutionized in the last ten years, with new discoveries 
continually transforming the field. 

Donated sperm has always been in short supply, but in recent 
years the demand for sperm has increased, according to a 1994 
issue of Human Rtproduction. Huszar estimates that 150 students 
have participated in the program since its inception 13 years ago. 
In most cases, because the lab has only 40 samples of sperm from 
each donor, the actual number of children born per donor is less 
than five. The average hovers around 3.8. Most of Huszar's 
patients have partners who suffer from congenital disease, sperm

them," he says. 

Huszar has a height requirement that 
David did not meet, even when wearing 
shoes. But because he met the other 
requirements, Huszar let the height 
requirement slide to accommodate David. 
Huszar won't fudge the requirement for 
everyone, though; Scott says his friend was 
told he was too short and rejected from 
the program. 

Finally, after .the donor passes the 
interview, the donor's physical charac-
teristics are entered into a computer 
database. Using this data, the lab matches 
the donor's characteristics with patients'. 
Just because patients purchase the sperm 
does not mean it comes with any 
guarantees. Huszar emphasizes to his 
patients that with any pregnancy-
whether the sperm is from the donor or 
the husband-comes the possibility of 
congenital malformation. 

"The fact of the matter is, I have done 
a much more careful analysis of the donors 
than a lot of people who meet, fall in love 
and marry each other," Huszar says. 
"Everybody is very happy with their 
children. They come back a second time, 
they send me pictures-! have a whole 
drawer full of pictures." 

But David, Scott, Jeff, and anyone else 
who has donated sperm to the lab will 
never see the pictures in Huszar's drawer. 
Upon acceptance into the program, each 
donor signs a contract that ensures the 
privacy of both the donors and the 
offspring. 

So what do the donors think about 
fathering children through the program? 
"I've debated this," says Scott, who 
describes himself as a philosophical 
nihilist. 
"This 
an 
interesting 
justification: In strict Darwinian terms 
your purpose is to replicate yourself. I 
believe I have pretty strong genes-I think 
a lot of people do-and I feel no qualms 
about propagating those genes throughout 
the human species. I'll have no emotional 
connection with my children, but then 
again, if you go far back everyone is related 
to ... moss. .. 

In order to p revent an emotional 
connection, Jeff stresses the importance of 
ensuring legal distance from potential 
offspring. When he attempted to donate, 
maintaining anonymity was Jeff's biggest 
concern. "I would never, ever, want the 
child to know who I am, and I would not 
want to know who the child was," Jeff 
says. 'Tm not fathering a child, I'm just 
helping other people who can't." 

Scott has no qualms about selling his 
gametes. "I'm not ashamed, and I find that 
I am a lot more relaxed about my entire 
sexuality as a result of having gone 
through this whole process. " Being a 
father, albeit a purely genetic one, 
demands some moral and ethical 
introspection. Having resolved those 
issues, however, donors find t hat 
participation becomes a unique, mind-
expanding experience. 

And lucrative besides.
