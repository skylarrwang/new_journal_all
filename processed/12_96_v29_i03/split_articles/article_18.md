EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
four- to six-week time lag between their 
intake and their first session. The system 
seems to mock these students for having their 
emotional crisis at the wrong time. 

By early October, Ken still had not heard 
from Mental Hygiene. "It had been so long 
since I went to my first meeting that I 
couldn't remember why I was g6ing in the 
first place," he says. When a therapist 
contacted him, scheduling conB.icts kept them 
from meeting immediately. "The receptionist 
told me he would be out of the office the 
Monday, Wednesday and Friday of next 
week," Ken says. His first meeting'was 
scheduled for November 15, seven weeks afrer 
he first went to Mental Hygiene. 

Siggins explains the waiting period as the 
price of an expeditious Mental Hygiene 
machine. "In universities in general, because 
mental health care is used more frequently 
than in the population at large, there is always 
a high demand. No one feels they have gotten 
to the point where no. one has to wait," 
Siggins says. Her reserved tone contrasts 
sharply with the voices of students who wait 
four to six, or even seven, weeks for :~,n 
appointment. 

e faults of the process include more 
han the time lapse between intake 
nd session. The entire method of 
matching students with therapists falls short 
of its promises. In the world of private 
therapy, people preview therapists as if 
interviewing someone for a job opening, 
considering various therapists until they find 
the right one for them. At Mental Hygiene, 
the process works in the opposite direction. 
During the intake appointment, therapists 
screen students. The department assigns 
therapists based on the characteristics students 
exhibit during the intake and the availability 
of staff. 

Inevitable mismatches occur between 
students and therapists. Alexis, who has 
resigned herself to working with a therapist 
whom she finds only tolerable, sees no 
available recourse for finding an alternative 
therapist in Mental Hygiene. "I don't know

how," she says matter-of-factly. "It's not as if ~ 
we can shop around." 

For all its pretense of catering to students' ~ 
needs, the system lacks flexibility. Siggins ~ 
balances the pain of waiting for an 
appointment and the failure to accomodate 
students' requests against the benefits of 24-
hour-a-day services. These services take the 
form of an on-call psychiatrist available within 
half an hour. "We try to see the people who 
are urgent right away, so we need some 
flexibility in our schedule to pick them up," 
Siggins says, meaning that students who are 
not in obvious "crisis" have to wait in line for 
appointments. 

The 24-hour service provides Siggins' 
explanation for why the cogs in Mental 
Hygiene's machinery often turn slowly, but 
only one or two students a day use the on-call 
service. The majority of students may not 
realize it exists. "I expect that most people 
know about it," Siggins says without concern. 
Mental Hygiene publicizes the 24-hour 
phone number, but only to a select group: 
freshmen counselors, residential college deans, 
and students who have aleady had an intake 
session. "Students who call in are usually in 
evaluation, or friends of people in evaluation," 
Siggins says. She seems to assume that those 
already involved in therapy are the only ones 
in need of 24-hour help. 

Yet even students who approach Mental 
Hygiene do not necessarily gain access to the 
on-call service. When I fuse went to Menral 
Hygiene on a Thursday, 1 left with an 
appointment slip for the following Monday. 
Four days feels torturous for someone who is 
not eating. No one provided me with the 
option to see an on-call psychiatrist, an option 
I might have gladly accepted. Never having 
had a problem of that caliber before, I did not 
know enough to ask for immediate help. 

As a Mental Hygiene rookie, Ken also 
feels out of the department's information 
loop. At the beginning of the semester, before 
he was "in evaluation," Ken had a fight with 
one of his best friends that left him 
emotionally distraught. "I didn't want to be 
dead, but I didn't want to be alive either. I 
wanted to be gone," Ken says without a hint 
of melodrama. The idea of calling Mental 
Hygiene in a moment of crisis seems foreign 
to him. "Who do you call at Mental Hygiene? 
What would I do?" he demands. If Ken had 
pursued the idea, he could have found the 
phone number by talking to a freshman 
counselor. Or he could have asked his 
residential college dean, the same man that 
Ken would dodge a few weeks later when 
exiting the UHS elevator. 

Freshmen may be even less likely to 
inquire about Mental Health Services. "In one 
sense, I stumbled onto it," Alexis says. "I had 
done something like it before in high school, 
and that made it easier. If you've never been 
involved in counseling, if you don't know 
your dean, or you aren't familiar with the 
process ... " Her voice trails off, as if Mental 
Hygiene represents a daunting presence to a 
newcomer. 

The involvement of a dean or freshman 
counselor strips the process of the 
confidentiality that Mental Hygiene promises. 
Confidentiality is a guiding principle behind 
any psychotherapy. Many private therapists' 
offices have two doors; one leads into the 
office from the waiting room, while the other 
leads out of the office into an alternate 
hallway. Patients never even see each other. By 
contrast, the rows of chairs in Mental 
Hygiene's waiting room provide an ideal 
location to spot aquaintances. Mental 
Hygiene sits directly across from Under-
graduate Med.ic~e-not from a urinalysis lab 
or an x-ray room, but from the department 
where all undergraduates migrate for illnesses 
ranging from tickly throats to walking 
pneumonia, a department with an exposed 
waiting area primed for an influx of students 
who will inevitably know someone walking 
into Mental Hygiene. 

S 
iggins depends on word-of-mouth to 
destigmatize Mental Hygiene. "The 
way to affect undergraduates," she says 
evenly, "is through other undergraduates. 
They won't listen to anyone else." If 
students would open up more about their 
experiences with Mental Hygiene, perhaps 
some of the stigma attached to the 
department would disappear, Siggins argues. 
However, 
Mental 
Hygiene has 
developed a far from pristine image among 
its clientele. The negative factors of an 
overloaded and non-user-friendly service 
frequently accompany the positive elements 
of counseling and emotional support. 

Students often find their sessions beneficial, 
but cannot forgive the impersonal 
machinery sur-rounding therapy. 

Siggins, however, believes that Mental 
Hygiene provides effective services, and that 
any stigma preventing more students from 
using its services stems from society at large 
· rather than Yale's Mental Health Services in 
particular. Yet, Siggins usually does not like 
to reveal the exact number of Yalies who 
visit Mental Hygiene to people outside the 
mental health profession. "I would not want 
people to think that all those students at 
Yale are troubled," she says with a nervous 
smile. She insists that this reflects the 
potential misunderstanding of the 
community rather than any personal sense 
of stigma. 

Still, her comment mirrors students' 
ambivalence towards Mental Hygiene and 
their hesitancy to share the experiences they 
have there. Those who enter the 
department face an often flawed, 
mechanical process. Students exiting Mental 
Hygiene do not necessarily emerge shiny 
and new. At times, the process leaves them 
embedded with nicks and scratches, and 
wrapped in packaging that pronounces: 
"Handle With Care." This may explain why 
some students prefer the anonymity of the 
back staircase when entering Mental 
Hygiene. When Alexis informed me of the 
presence of the secret door, I could not help 
wishing I had noticed it myself two )Mt 
earlier.
