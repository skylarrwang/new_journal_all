Customers pulled their cars into 
the lot, saw the picket, and drove away. 


A police officer gave the protestors a 
ticket and made them move to public 
property. But after four months of 
weekly demonstrations, the group won 
one of its first major public labor cases: 
the three employees who had been fired 
from Outback Steakhouse after filing 
sexual harassment charges were paid a 
settlement by the national chain. 


The case helped to establish 
Unidad Latina and the New Haven 
Workers Association as trusted activist 
organizations within the city, and they 
began to receive a growing number 
of referrals for similar cases in other 
local shops and restaurants. The group 
has handled hundreds of cases since 
its founding in 2002. By now, it has a 
streamlined strategy for responding to 
complaints. Major cases in the city have 
included Outback Steakhouse, Rocco’s 
Bakery, Downtown at the Taft, and Cafe 
Goodfellas. 


The 
New 
Haven 
Workers 
Association helped Palma, Morales, and 
their coworkers to file their complaints. 
Morales was working sixty to seventy 
hours a week at the restaurant while 
being paid less than the minimum wage, 
with no time-and-a-half for overtime. 
Morales, who speaks only Spanish 
and admits to being undocumented, 
worked with his fellow complainants to 
provide information to help prove their 
allegations: the workers’ stories matched, 
they had their own records of their pay, 
and they were able to describe aspects of 
the restaurant’s operations in vivid detail. 
Palma convinced the other men to 
come forward after first realizing how 
widespread the problem was across 
the city and then understanding what 
his rights were by speaking with the 
Department of Labor through the New 
Haven Workers Association. “We’re 
going to fight for [what we are owed],” 
he says that he told the workers. “I don’t 
think I’m a leader, but my guys follow 
me. I do it because we are human beings, 
and we are supposed to take care of 
everyone else.”


After gathering information, the 
New Haven Workers Association sends 
a certified letter to the owner of an 
accused business alerting them to the 
allegations and requesting a response 
by a certain date. Lugo says that about 
forty percent of claims are settled after 
the initial letter through negotiations. 
The majority, though, are not. “The 
owners just tried to hide themselves” 
initially in response to the complaints 
about the Taft, Morales says. Palma says 
that he received a threatening phone call 
from one of his former bosses after he 
saw Palma’s name in print. But, he says, 
he also received help because of his 
relationship with the press: “Every time 
we go in the newspaper, people call me 
and say, ‘Ah, it’s true, I remember that 
happened to me.’” 


When owners do not respond to 
the initial letters, Unidad Latina either 
works with a lawyer to file a case or puts 
together a complaint and sends it to the 
federal or state Department of Labor. 
However, the former costs money and 
can be nerve-wracking for complainants 
without legal permission to work, while 
the latter can take far longer than the 
workers are able to wait.  Sheila Hayre, 
an attorney at New Haven Legal Aid, 
estimates that the Department of 
Labor can take a full year to even open 
an investigation into a complaint, and 
up to a year more to resolve it. Still, 
organizers usually take advantage of the 
free forms to apply for an investigation, 
knowing that it will often uncover a 
series of discrepancies in the owner’s 
bookkeeping. They also, if workers feel 
comfortable, put them in touch with 
Department of Labor representatives 
to help confirm their feelings of being 
treated wrongly. “We went to the Labor 
Department, and they explained it to 
me,” says Palma. “People in those kinds 
of positions don’t really realize how 
much they’re supposed to make. You 
should know you should make more 
than that.” 


But 
appealing 
to 
government 
channels is merely the first, and quietest, 
step in Unidad Latina’s support of the 
workers. They also organize picket 
lines, host direct actions, and call 
press conferences to publicize their 
accusations. On December 17, 2010, 
boycottbaccusenoteca.blogspot.com 
went live with an entry about a picket 
line and a phone number to call with 
complaints.  “This restaurant owes nearly 
$100,000 in unpaid wages to 7 former 
workers,” read the headline. “Wage theft 
is a crime.”


Unidad Latina learned from trial 
and error to hold pickets on Fridays 
in order to have the greatest effect on 
a restaurant’s profits and to hold press 
conferences on Wednesday afternoons 
in order to draw the largest number of 
press outlets. The number of protestors 
varies between ten and forty; workers 
often bring their friends for support. 
The approach has been effective. 
Goodfellas, though initially unwilling 
to negotiate despite orders from the 
Department of Labor, finally paid its 
workers the full $23,000 that they had 
been owed after a large press conference 
was called and organizers warned of a 
redoubling of picketing efforts. However, 
picketers run the risk of alienating the 
local population—“Glares are the nicest 
thing they do,” says Chris Garaffa, a co-
founder of the New Haven Workers 
Association and a regular participant 
in the picket lines—or having run-ins 
with the police, which can be extremely 
dangerous 
for 
any 
undocumented 
workers participating in public action. 


It can also take a long time for protests 
to take effect, and if a restaurant closes, 
as Downtown at the Taft did, it can be 
difficult for organizers to find a place to 
make a stand. But even with the dangers 
involved, Lugo is convinced that direct 
action is a necessary addition to Unidad 
Latina’s more official complaints. “Many 
of the big victories in this country, they 
got won on the streets,” he says.


For Lugo and Garaffa, undocumented 
workers are the most difficult to 
convince to come to public protests. 
Sometimes, in those cases, Garaffa offers 
complainants complete anonymity and 
lets them miss their own picket lines. “If 
you work, you deserve to get paid,” he 
says. “When we talk about a case with 
the press, we don’t specify whether it 
involves an immigrant or not.”


Certainly, the workers impacted 
by wage theft are not solely illegal 
immigrants. Many of them are Latino 
and here legally; many others are of 
other backgrounds and are caught up 
in the same low wage job market as 
the immigrants are. Erin Talbot, who is 
white, worked briefly as a waitress at the 
vegetarian restaurant Thali Too. On her 
first day on the job during the summer 
after the restaurant opened, she alleges 
that she heard her boss threatening to 
have workers’ wages withheld during 
future shifts for not setting the table 
correctly. Rattan Kaul, the manager of 
Thali Too for the past year, says that he 
heard no reports of payment disputes 
from Talbot or other employees, and 
that the restaurant’s payments are 
done through a computer system that 
automatically issues wages by the hour. 


According to Talbot, the incident 
prompted her to quit because she had 
another job offer, but many others are 
not so fortunate. 


“Especially in this economy, if 
there are enough people looking for 
jobs…most people will endure far less 
than ideal working conditions,” she 
said in a phone interview. Indeed, part 
of the purpose of the founding of the 
New Haven Workers Association out of 
Unidad Latina was to better represent 
workers who were not members of the 
populations with which Unidad Latina 
usually works. However, that Talbot 
was confident enough in her rights as a 
worker to stand up to the manager in the 
first place sets her apart from most of 
the undocumented workers who work in 
the back of the house at restaurants and 
service shops. 


The stereotyping of Latinos across 
the country makes the public less 
sympathetic to uneven power dynamics


businesses to avoid. A 2009 survey of 
four thousand low-wage workers across 
Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York 
found that twenty-six percent of those 
workers had been paid less than the 
minimum wage in the week prior, and 
seventy-six percent of them had either 
been underpaid or not paid for overtime 
hours. “If you go to any…place in New 
Haven, the only way they can survive is 
by paying less than the minimum wage. 
That’s the reality of the industry. I feel 
that’s not right,” says John Lugo, one of 
the leaders of Unidad Latina. 


Traditionally, federal and state 
governments have been the arbiters 
of 
workplace 
behavior, 
regulating 
minimum wages, investigating fraud, 
and collecting taxes. But cunning 
employers have found other ways to 
skimp on their payroll, banking on the 
fact that workers are too intimidated 
or too easily replaced to protest. And 
when employees do speak up, as Palma 
did, they are often ignorant of the laws 
on their side. Since contacting the New 
Haven Workers Association, Aranda 
has sent two letters to Mario’s Discount 
Furniture demanding payment for her 
back wages. If her claims are true, she 
is owed for her unpaid work. But when 
asked if she knew that she had legal 
rights to compensation and protection 
in the workplace before she came into 
contact with the organizers, Aranda fell 
silent. Her reply was simple, and quiet. 
“No.” 


The recent battles for wage justice in 
New Haven began with a victory 
in 2007. In January of that year, four 
years before Palma came forward with 
his allegations against Downtown at 
the Taft, members and allies of Unidad 
Latina sang a modified Christmas carol 
outside of an Outback Steakhouse in 
North Haven:


Down by the freezer
Where the kitchen staff  is harassed
He said, “Hey hon, why don’t ya give 
me some 
Or this paycheck is your last.’‘

The May 1 march sought to stop downtown New Haven traffic in honor of
 International Worker’s Day.

Protestors carried 
puppets representing 
workers.
