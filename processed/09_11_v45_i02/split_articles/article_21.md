for her were spouses who had been 
on the other side of her cases,” said 
Steven Wolfson, her husband of forty-
five years. The two met at a party their 
freshman year of college, when Susan 
was at Barnard and Steven at Columbia, 
and they’ve been together ever since.


Even after Mrs. Wolfson was 
diagnosed with ovarian cancer, she 
continued to work until 2004, when 
she finally had to retire. And then, 
after a long, hard battle—she had first 
been diagnosed six years earlier—Mrs. 
Wolfson decided that it was time to stop 
fighting and start living.


By then, she could no longer eat 
due to the masses that had spread 
throughout her abdomen. The contents 
of her stomach had to be continually 
suctioned out through a special machine. 
She couldn’t walk. She was in a great 
deal of pain when she finally suggested a 
transfer from Yale-New Haven Hospital 
to Connecticut Hospice, a facility in 
Branford devoted to end of life and 
palliative care, a facility to which Dr. 
Wolfson, a cardiologist, often refers his 
patients.


There are four levels of hospice 
care, ranging from the lowest level called 
routine care, in which a patient receives 
support services such as visits from a 
nurse to their own home, to the highest 
level of care, in which the patient is cared 
for in an inpatient unit. The Richard L. 
Rosenthal Hospice Center in Stamford 
provides inpatient hospice care but 
is licensed as a skilled nursing facility, 
while inpatient services at Middlesex 
Hospice and Palliative Care are provided 
on the top floor of Middlesex Hospital. 
Currently, CT Hospice is the only facility 
in Connecticut licensed specifically as a 
hospice to provide all four levels of care.


Just days after her arrival there, Mrs. 
Wolfson finally got what she had spent 
four weeks of her life longing for: a bath.


It took three nurses’ aides to do it, 
and a nurse about fifteen feet away if 
anything should go wrong. Together, 
the three aides used a hoist to raise 
Mrs. Wolfson up, and then they slowly 
lowered her into a giant tub filled with 
hot water, a tub that looked to Dr. 
Wolfson rather like a Jacuzzi.


Mrs. Wolfson loved it, and the bath 
soon became a regular occurrence, with 
the nurses singing her songs while they 
bathed her. Their favorite, Dr. Wolfson 
fondly recalled several years later, was 
“You Are My Sunshine.” 


The melody of the song is simple, 
and so too is the chorus. First recorded 
in 1939, it is a song parents still sing 
to their toddlers as they tuck them in 
at night. Yet, it seems especially suited 
not only for those whose lives are just 
beginning, but also for those whose lives 
are drawing to a close.


And so as the nurses cleaned Mrs. 
Wolfson’s broken body, as they gently 
scrubbed her with soap and then let the 
warm water wash over her frail limbs, 
carrying away the dirt and grime of a 
daily battle with cancer, they sang:
You are my sunshine,
My only sunshine.
You make me happy
When skies are gray.
You’ll never know, dear,
How much I love you.
Please don’t take my sunshine away.


O
f course, giving Mrs. Wolfson such 
a bath once, let alone multiple 
times, was a very labor-intensive process.

It meant that three fewer nurses’ aides 
were available to the fifty-two other 
patients that CT Hospice might be caring 
for on any given day. It meant that there 
had to be a nurse not only on duty, but 
also available should anything go wrong. 
“Standard nursing home levels of 
care would not have been able to do this, 
in short,” Dr. Wolfson said.  


If Dr. Wolfson is right, many 
patients like his wife won’t be getting 
such baths in the future. For the first time 
since the establishment of regulations 
governing hospice care, the Department 
of Public Health has proposed changes 
that would make the regulations more 
in line with those governing standard 
nursing home care.


Regulations for hospice care were 
first put into effect in 1977, when CT 
Hospice sought to open its doors. CT 
Hospice was the first hospice in the 
country to open, and the regulations 
were tailored specifically to it. They 
were especially strict because the idea 
of a facility devoted to end of life care 
was so novel and because people feared 
for the wellbeing of those nearing their 
final days. Pages were devoted just to the 
kinds of arts programming the facility 
would need to provide. 


The proposed regulations seek to 
modernize the delivery of hospice care 
and increase access. In order to do so, 
they relax the previous regulations—for 
instance, an onsite pharmacy would no 
longer be required. Another change is 
the replacement of a nurse to patient 
ratio of one to six with the requirement 
that facilities have “sufficient” staffing 
and services. “Sufficient” means there 
will still be a Registered Nurse present 
twenty-four hours a day, with additional 
staff available based on how many 
patients are at a given facility and what 
their medical needs are, explains Tracy 
Wodatch, vice president of clinical and 
regulatory services at the Connecticut 
Association for Homecare and Hospice, 
of which all twenty-nine hospices in the 
state are members. 


Costs were not a major factor in 
the changes made to the regulations, 
said Deborah Hoyt, president and 
CEO of the Connecticut Association 
for Homecare and Hospice. Medicare 
tends to reimburse patients for hospice 
care on a case-by-case basis depending 
on the amount of time they stay and the 
degree of care they need, she said. Still, 
some of the proposed changes, such as 
the elimination of an onsite pharmacy, 
could save money for facilities and 
patients alike, Hoyt added. 


Many worry, however, that the 
relaxation of these regulations, and 
especially the elimination of required 
nurse to patient ratios, will be detrimental 
to the health and well being of the 


“The parts that for me are the most 
problematic are the nurse to patient 
ratios, and then among the nurses the 
percentage that are RNs versus [Licensed 
Practical 
Nurses],” 
said 
Elizabeth 
Bradley, a professor of public health 
and nursing at the Yale School of Public 
Health. The ability of a nurse to think 
ahead, to anticipate and reason in terms 
of diagnostics, “makes a huge difference 
for the patient,” she said, and RNs are 
more qualified nurses. While RNs need a 
four-year degree, LPNs need only about 
a year of study. 


Dr. Wolfson agrees that the 
importance of set staffing levels 
should not be underestimated. “The 
people  who are referred for inpatient 
care at an inpatient hospice facility are 
not only dying, they’re also critically ill,” 
he said. “If the goal is for them to die in 
comfort, then a good staffing coverage 
level is vital.”


And though proponents of the 
regulations argue that staffing levels will 
still be strong, just less strictly managed, 
opponents of the regulations are far 
from convinced.


“With language like ‘sufficient’ staff 
with no definition of what that means, 
the whole reputation of hospice care that 
lets people die with dignity goes out the 
window,” said Luis Gonsalez, director 
of planning, training, and research at 
CT Hospice in the John D. Thompson 
Hospice Institute.


Ronny Knight, the senior vice 
president of CT Hospice, has statistics 
that perhaps give credence to Mr. 
Gonsalez’s assertion. According to a 
2007 study by the Hospice Association 
of America, the average nurse to patient 
ratio for an inpatient unit was one RN 
to 8.6 patients, the ratio at a hospice 
residence was one nurse to twenty-seven 
patients, and the ratio at CT Hospice is 
one nurse to six patients, he testified at 
an April 4 Department of Public Health 
hearing about the proposed regulations. 
In other words, at CT Hospice, nurses 
are responsible for far fewer patients 
than nurses at other facilities. 


“There’s nothing in these regulations 
to prevent this minimal standard of care 
other than a discretionary directive to 
provide sufficient staffing. This latitude 
will assure more profit, less staffing 
and less care as a likely outcome,” he 
continued. 


More simply, some fear that fewer 
nurses mean fewer chances for patients 
to feel clean and cared for. 

“With language 
like ‘sufficient’ 
staff with no 
definition 
of what that
means, the whole 
reputation of hos­
pice care that lets 
people die with
dignity goes out 
the window.”

Shatreen Masshoor ’12 has had 
experience with facilities that don’t have 
adequate staffing. She hopes to someday 
become a doctor, and she took time 
off from school to become a Certified 
Nurse Assistant and work at a skilled 
nursing facility in Washington state for 
a little over a year. Now, she volunteers 
at CT Hospice for three hours once a 
week during the school year, and she 
can see the difference in care provided 
at the two facilities. She remembers 
coming in to the skilled nursing facility 
one day and finding a patient who hadn’t 
been checked on all night. The patient 
had multiple bowel movements and a 
wet bed, something she has yet to see at 
CT Hospice. And while patients at the 
skilled nursing facility in Washington 
state were only washed a couple times 
a week, at CT Hospice everyone gets at 
least a bed bath every day, she added. 


 “It seems like they’re pretty on 
point about it,” Masshoor said.


T
he proposed changes in the state 
regulations were prompted by 
changes to federal standards, Wodatch 
said. All hospices must comply not 
only with state standards but also with 
federal ones, specifically the Medicare 
Conditions of Participation, which were 
updated in 2008. They must also comply 
with Connecticut Home Health Care 
Regulations. 


The Department of Public Health 
is currently in the process of reviewing 
the proposed changes, spokesman for 
the department William Gerrish said. 
Twenty-eight hospices in Connecticut 
support them, and CT Hospice opposes 
them. The hearing April 4 was held 
so that the Department of Public 
Health could hear testimony about the 
regulations, and over fifty individuals 
spoke.


After reviewing the testimony and 
making any changes it sees as necessary, 
the DPH will send the regulations to the 
attorney general’s office, Gerrish said. 
From there, the regulations will go to 
the regulations review committee for 
final approval. The regulations will be 
implemented upon the approval of the 
committee, he said.


Modernization, streamlining care, 
creating a more home-like environment, 
and improving access are the main goals 
of the proposed changes, Wodatch said. 
The new regulations are more patient-
based, focusing on quality outcomes 
rather than specific guidelines, she said. 
Although hospices would no longer need 
to meet certain nurse to patient ratios, 
they still would need to meet quality 
outcome assessments and standards, she 
said.


“1977 to now is light years away,” 
said Carol Mahier, executive director 
of Hospice Southeastern Connecticut, 
which last year serviced 629 patients in 
New London county and is planning to 
open a new facility under the proposed 
regulations. 


In addition, according to the 
latest data from the National Hospice 
Palliative Care Organization, nearly one 
in five hospice agencies in the country 
operate an inpatient unit or facility. 
Those numbers mean that out of the 
county’s five thousand hospice facilities, 
one thousand have an inpatient unit, 
Wodatch said at the April 4 hearing. 
Only one of those is in Connecticut, she 
added. That facility is CT Hospice, and 
proponents of the regulations say that 
it alone is not enough, even when the 
two other facilities in Middlesex and in 
Stamford that have inpatient units but 
are not licensed as hospices are taken 
into account. Wodatch pointed out 
during the April 4 hearing that while 
the average national time for a patient 
to spend in hospice is seventy-one days, 
Connecticut ranks last in the country, 
with an average stay of only forty-eight 
days.


Moreover, the need for hospice 
care continues to rise. Demand for 
hospice care is growing at a rate of nine 
percent per year, Hoyt wrote in a letter 
to the editor published in the New Haven 
Register.  


“Patients can be placed in a hospital, 
but that is not where somebody usually 
wants to die,” Mahier said, adding that a 
nursing home is also not really a place a 
40-year-old who is dying would want to 
be either. “A residence is what’s needed,” 
she said.


If the new regulations were to 
pass, the Rosenthal Center would apply 
immediately for a new license as a 
hospice, and Hospice of Southeastern 
Connecticut and Regional Hospice 
of Western Connecticut are among 
the facilities that would attempt to put 
a freestanding facility up, Wodatch 
said. The new facilities would mean 
that patients in counties such as New 
London wouldn’t have to drive hours to 
visit loved ones at CT Hospice.


Opponents of the regulations, 
however, argue that the claim for the 
need for access is unwarranted. Hospice 
facilities can offer patients rooms in 
both hospitals and nursing homes—
indeed, CT Hospice has two to three 
beds in many hospitals on reserve—and 
so any patient who needs inpatient care 
can find it relatively easily, Gonsalez said. 


In fact, Bradley says there isn’t 
really an access problem at all. Bradley 
has done research on hospice care for 
over a decade, looking at what makes 
people choose hospice, why hospices are 
underutilized, and the effectiveness of 
hospice programs across the country.


Her research has shown that  ninety 
percent of all patients in Connecticut 
are within thirty minutes of access to 
a hospice. “For me, I don’t really see 
the positive of making the legislation 
looser,” she said.


In fact, her research indicates 
that Connecticut is one of the four 
best states in the country for hospice 
care. Connecticut exceeds the federal 
Medicare standard, she said. “It’s really
