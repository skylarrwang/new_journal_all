A turn on the newly restored carousel at 
Lighthouse Park.

since 1924 and evacuated the horses due 
to weather for the first time this August. 
As Hurricane Irene approached, the 
parks department had special movers 
dismantle the carousel and place the 
pieces into trucks to move them offsite. 
The horses were transported back a few 
days later. 
The city had moved the herd before, 
in the late seventies, when it could 
not afford the carousel’s operation. 
Unlike other municipalities affected by 
the depression, New Haven kept the 
horses in storage. The mayor formed 
a group in 1980 called the Friends of 
the Carousel that systematically raised 
money to resurrect, repaint, and refresh 
the carousel. The group succeeded, and 
the carousel reopened in 1983. 
The sixty-eight horsetails are real 
horsetails, the horses hand-painted tin, 
and the gold paint 24-carat gold leaf. 
Four years ago, the set of horses was 
quartered and taken out in sections to 
be refurbished and repainted. The last 
quarter was finished and placed this 
April, completing the renovation at 
thirty-two hundred dollars a horse. The 
running price for a ride is fifty cents. 
In the 1920s, that golden age of 
radio, sports, and carousels, there were 
ten thousand carousels around the 
country like the one in this pavilion 
on the southeast side of New Haven. 
Carousels once were driven by steam. 
Today, there are fewer than 150 running 
and open to the public.
The nearest carousel to New Haven’s 
used to be the one at West Haven’s Savin 
Rock Park, but that carousel’s pieces 
were sold in 1971 to Magic Mountain, the 
Six Flags amusement park in Valencia, 
California. Savin Rock Park once had 
seven carousels and was considered the 
Disneyland of its day from the 1890s 
until the Great Depression. Upon paying 
three hundred and fifty thousand dollars 
for the set of forty-seven horses, plus 
one thousand dollars for shipping, the 
California amusement park immediately 
cast fiberglass duplicates of the horses 
and sold off the originals at prices 
rumored to be extravagant. 
Event and Project Coordinator for 
the Department of Parks Sabrina Bruno 
estimates that New Haven’s carousel is 
worth up to three million dollars post-
renovation, or roughly forty thousand 
a horse. (Even an outstanding Arabian 
racehorse costs ten to twenty thousand 
dollars.) 
Some 
New 
Haven 
residents 
remember a relatively recent age of 
chipped paint and sad-looking horses. 
All are invited to the one hundred year 
anniversary celebration next spring to 
see the horses show off their new coats. 
The anniversary was technically this year, 
but additional fundraising will necessarily 
precede the festivities, set tentatively for 
the first weekend in May.
The parks department’s operation 
is seasonal, running March to October, 
with about eighty events each year. The 
aim is to make the carousel and the 
lighthouse financially self-sufficient, but 
the bigger goal is to preserve love for 
these local spots. Some of the history 
of the carousel is lost already, frustrating 
carousel aficionados turned scholars like 
Peter Malia, originally of West Haven, 
where Lighthouse Point’s horses were 
hand-carved by two master carvers 
he considers the Michaelangelos of 
carousel horse carving. 
“People consider them folk art, 
but you have to go see these horses 
to understand that these aren’t just 
folk art. They’re highly sophisticated 
wooden sculptures, not ones you’d find 
at a country fair,” said Malia, author of 
Flying Horses: The Golden Age of  American 
Carousel Art, 1870-1930.
Malia’s is the first fully documented 
history 
of 
carousels 
in 
America. 
He published the book last year in 
conjunction with the New England 
Carousel Museum in Bristol, Conn. 
New Haven’s herd is considered one of 
the best and most beautiful carousels 
anywhere, Malia said. 
The main draw for park visitors, 
however, is not historical, though Bruno 
assures that there are and always will be a 
few carousel buffs. The free parking and 
use of the park for New Haven residents 
(and twenty-dollar flat rate per day for 
other Connecticut residents) bring 
families, some of whom come weekly 
in the summer as they try to escape 
the heat. The carousel runs at ten miles 
an hour, slightly higher than average 
carousel speeds, Malia said. Regulations 
tend to limit speeds at six to twelve miles 
an hour.  
Annette Lilly has lived in New 
Haven her whole life and visits the 2,200-
acre park every weekend, sometimes 
twice a weekend. 
“We live in New Haven. Nothing 
else to do but come here,” she said. She 
visits with her husband, sometimes her 
children and her granddaughter. Her 
daughter-in-law had her baby shower in 
the park, by the beach. Lilly’s connection 
to the place stems from ennui for 
everything else New Haven more than 
interest in this particular landmark. 
“I used to love New Haven,” she said 
listlessly. “It’s been so many years.”
Out-of-state visitors pay thirty 
dollars per car for the park’s proximity 
to the Long Island Sound and the harbor 
lighthouse (also called Five Mile Point 
Light for its five-mile distance from the 
New Haven Green). One family reunion 
this summer involved almost one 
hundred family members spread over 
five generations for a cookout. Elaine 
Jones and her family drove more than 
seven hundred miles from Charlotte, 
North Carolina, and were glad they did.
“It’s a family-oriented park and 
it has the water, it has the carousel—
everything you might be looking for 
when you got a lot of little children, 
grandchildren, 
great-grandchildren,” 
Jones said.
She sent off these young family 
members with a fifty-cent fare and 
watched them shout ‘Hi, Mama! Hi, 
Nana! Hi!’ and wave hysterically each 
time they came around to the front, 
where she stood and waved and made 
faces back. As the children got off the 
carousel, they ran toward her, asking, 
“Remember when I said ‘Hi’ to you? 
Remember? Do you?” and then ran past 
her.
Carazmia Buonome-Scott, age 4, 
finds herself absorbed from time to 
time in the carousel’s spin. She takes a 
bus with her grandmother and her sister 
and then leaves them behind to mount a 
favorite horse she has knighted Bluesy. 
“Well, I named him that!” she 
declares. Bluesy is white and gold, with 
pink and green trim. Carazmia rides 
him every Saturday and plays on the 
playground, a recent addition to the 
park. 
projects 
like 
these 
are 
funded in part by events at the park. 
A wedding between two Yale history 
PhD candidates included a history of 
Lighthouse Point Park handwritten in 
segments on the back of old postcards 
with pictures of the park starting in the 
1900s, which the couple had collected 
over many months at old bookstores. 
Events in the glassed pavilion often have 
such themes or motifs.
“We’re fortunate in that people 
who are looking for a unique venue are 
also unique themselves,” Bruno said. 
“The brides we get may have the same 
nervousness as other brides, but they 
have new thoughts, and totally different 
ideas for their weddings.”
The white pavilion includes a dance 
floor, a ceiling with delicate paper balls 
dangling casually across, and round 
white wooden tables and chairs. And, of 
course, the carousel.
Feel free to look any of these sixty-
eight horses in the mouth. Each horse is 
treated, sometimes daily if weather and 
use warrant it, by careful hands reaching 
a special solution into the crevices of the 
body. The horsetails are washed, treated, 
wiped, and dried individually twice a 
year, at the beginning and end of riding 
season. 
The carousel currently at Lighthouse 
Point Park was built in 1912 and installed 
in 1916 in the white-walled Victorian-
style pavilion behind the historical 
lighthouse on the beach. The New 
Haven Department of Parks, Recreation 
and Trees has operated the carousel

“People come from all over asking 
us, ‘Do we actually get to ride that? Is 
that actually going to run for us?’” 
Bruno said. “What happens is that they 
sometimes rent it because they have a 
lot of children in the wedding party or 
because they decided to have children at 
their weddings, and it’s not the children 
that ride, it’s the adults. Everyone has so 
much fun.”
The money not allocated for staff 
salaries goes into a special enterprise 
fund that supports the constant upkeep 
of the sixty-eight horses. The park also 
makes money on an outdoor adventure 
program, offering activities including 
canoeing, kayaking, mountain biking, 
and a ropes course, at subsidized costs, 
usually about half the costs of private, 
for-profit programs. The park runs 
camps for kids all summer in conjunction 
with this program.
The semi-commercial model is 
unusual and complicated, but it protects 
the department from budget cuts, which 
the parks department suffers before 
most other public departments.
“It’s a labor of love,” Bruno said. 
“And it’s all dedication by the people 
of the city of New Haven, particularly 
under the stewardship of this parks 
department.”
And though the carousel’s future 
may lie in the waving hands of younger 
generation, its maintenance falls to these 
staff. “The carousel is really something 
to be cherished and loved and of course 
the more children we expose to it, the 
greater chances that they’ll care the way 
we have, as we move on and they move 
up,” Bruno said. 
Staff 
members 
become 
easily 
attached to the park system and to 
Lighthouse Point Park.
“It’s just a gem, in my own way of 
looking at it,” said parks staff member 
Dean Graham.
The eighty events a year occupy 
the staff, who wear neon yellow shirts 
marking them as parks department 
employees during the day, but white dress 
shirts and black pants at night, when 
their pay comes from the enterprise 
fund. 
“There’s always something to do, 
there’s always something going on 
around here with all these busy weekends 
and holidays and family reunions,” 
Graham said. “We clean up, set up, clean 
up, set up, clean up again, ‘round and 
‘round and ‘round.”
