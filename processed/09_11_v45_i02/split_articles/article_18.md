and-a-half overtime pay, or a failure to 
pay wages at all. Wage theft is a national 
problem playing out in hundreds of city 
downtowns. And with the percentage 
of workers who are union members 
now at a third of its mid-20th century 
height, these workers, many of whom 
are concentrated in the lowest rungs of 
the service industry and some of whom 
are undocumented, are among the most 
vulnerable members of the economy 
as it struggles to recover from the 2008 
crash.


Workers who are illegally employed 
often have the hardest time coming 
forward about these violations, despite 
the fact that certain workers’ rights 
are universally protected by law. All 
unsalaried workers are entitled to 
the minimum wage and to overtime 
pay when they work more than forty 
hours a week. All can sue to recover 
lost wages. Antonio DiBenedetto, the 
owner of Rocco’s Bakery on Ferry 
Street, pled guilty in January to holding 
six Ecuadorian employees as wage 
slaves to work from 2000 to 2008. They 
were eventually rescued by the U.S. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
in a raid that, rather than deporting the 
immigrants, granted them protection 
from the alleged abuse. 


The owners of Mario’s Discount 
Furniture, 
Cafe 
Goodfellas, 
and 
Downtown at the Taft did not respond 
despite repeated and acknowledged 
requests for comment.


Reyes Morales, who worked in the 
kitchen at Downtown at the Taft with 
Palma, says, “[Bosses] exploit workers 
a lot. They take advantage of people 
who are undocumented. Workers are 
afraid of losing their jobs, so they don’t 
say anything.” Like Aranda, he had 
no knowledge of the protections that 
the United States offers to all workers, 
regardless of their immigration status, 
under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 
1938. 


“There is a new slavery in the 
United States,” said Guadalupe Montiel, 
who works with both Unidad Latina 
and the non-profit Junta for Progressive 
Action. “Immigrants are being treated as 
slaves.”


Last year, New York state passed 
the Wage Theft Prevention Act, which 
mandated that employers supply all 
workers with salary information at the 
start of their employment. Activists 
in New Haven hope to pass similar 
legislation, and the individuals, both 
documented and undocumented, who 
have stepped forward thus far have won 
important victories. Federal- and state-
level investigations by the Department 
of Labor have led to the delivery of tens 
of thousands of dollars in back-owed 
wages, while public protests and private 
negotiations have prompted back-door 
settlements for thousands of dollars 
more. 


But not everyone in the city believes 
in seeking complete wage compliance. 
Some employers see low wages as the 
only way to survive in a competitive city. 
Some argue simply that this problem 
pervades the entire service industry, 
making 
it 
difficult 
for 
individual 
“In New Haven, 
the only way 
business 
owners can 
survive is by 
paying less than 
the minimum 
wage. That’s 
the reality of the 
industry. I feel 
that’s not right.”
three months of negotiations with the 
owners of Downtown at the Taft.


“The parties appear to have reached 
a settlement,” said Peter Goselin, a 
lawyer representing the workers. “The 
details are being worked out, but we 
are very optimistic that the settlement 
will resolve all of the claims of the six 
workers.”


When Palma worked at Downtown 
at the Taft, he says, the restaurant’s owners 
gave him a sum of money to distribute 
to the other kitchen workers. Divided up, 
this sum was below minimum wage and 
included no overtime. This forced Palma 
not only to lose out on his earnings but 
also to reach into his own pockets to 
help supplement those of men working 
under him in the kitchen. When he asked 
the owners for additional money, they 
avoided the question. “They always say, 
‘Yeah, yeah, tomorrow. Yeah, yeah, next 
week.’ There’s nothing you can do!” 


The increased hours took a toll 
on his family life, too. As Palma spent 
between eighty and a hundred hours 
a week trying to meet his employer’s 
demands in the kitchen, he saw less and 
less of his three children, the youngest 
of whom is just six years old. “I was 
losing my family; I worked so many 
hours that I couldn’t see my kids. By 
the last month, the only way to see my 
family at all was to call them and have 
them come for lunch at the restaurant.” 


The low wages and lack of time at 
home led Palma, after nearly two years 
of working for Downtown at the Taft, 
to quit. “One night, my daughter asks, 
‘When am I going to see you so we can 
talk?’ I realized that this is not a job, this 
is a life,” Palma says.


A
randa, Castillo, and Palma are 
three of a growing number of 
New Haven workers, led by organizers 
with Unidad Latina en Acción and the 
New Haven Workers Association, its 
multiethnic parter, who are seeking 
justice after alleged instances of unfair 
compensation. These violations of labor 
laws, often called wage theft, involve 
payment below Connecticut’s minimum 
wage of $8.25 an hour, a lack of time-
