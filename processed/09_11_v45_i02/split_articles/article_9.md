Louise Endel. According to New Haven 
Register reporter Randall Beach, Endel is 
“the woman who connects more people 
than Facebook.” 	


A rare New Haven socialite who 
holds the city’s record for number of 
community boards served (fifty-six 
over fifty years), Endel is at the crux 
of countless connections between the 
public service and social worlds. She 
takes particular interest in theater and 
currently serves on the board of the Elm 
Shakespeare Company as well as the 
board of the Long Wharf Theatre—and 
on the boards of LEAP (Leadership, 
Education, and Athletics in Partnership), 
Friends of the New Haven Free Public 
Library, the International Festival of 
Arts and Ideas, and the advisory board 
of All Our Kin.


Endel’s surprise ninetieth birthday 
party took place on Wednesday, July 
1. On Thursday, the Elm Shakespeare 
Company held a dinner in her honor. 
On Saturday, another dinner party for 
Endel followed a daytime picnic for her 
family and close friends. One of Endel’s 
friends hosted a birthday brunch for her 
the following day. Friday’s gala, open 
to the public, featured a performance 
by the Midtown Men, on a special tour 
reuniting four members of the original 
cast of Jersey Boys. 


“The running joke is that when it’s 
all over she’ll be the last one standing,” 
Patty Endel, her youngest daughter, said. 
“We’re all going to be exhausted, and 
she’s just going to be asking, ‘When’s the 
next party?’”


The biggest and most profitable 
of the celebrations, the gala was itself a 
series of parties. 


The first was a silent auction. Prizes 
ranged from a weekend in a country 
house worth four thousand dollars 
to lunch with New Yorker staff writer 
Adam Gopnik, starting at five hundred. 
Rounds and rounds of drinks were 
served alongside miniature foods like 
quarter-sized cheeseburgers and pinky-
sized kabobs—perhaps to make guests 
feel like giants before they wrote checks 
to the theater. 


The auction room led into the main 
ballroom where a bell curve of number 
and gleam of sequins worn versus age 
was the law. Except for a few very old 
and very young guests, all in attendance 
glittered. 


The guest of honor wore a fuchsia 
blouse in rose print with flower brooches. 
She tapped along with her feet when the 
Midtown Men brought her onstage—
after sets of songs of The Beach Boys, 
The Jackson 5, The Temptations, and 
The Beatles—to serenade her with 
“Can’t Take My Eyes Off You” and 
invite the audience to sing along.
