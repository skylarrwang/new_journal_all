necessary either. Hospice facilities are 
dealing with a finite group of symptoms, 
she said. “This is what we do every day.”
“How many nursing homes do you 
know that have a pharmacy?” she added. 
But James Proto, the head of the 
pharmacy at CT Hospice, said at the 
hearing that he can’t imagine care without 
one. He said he is an active member of 
the interdisciplinary team, doing rounds 
daily with nurses, something he wouldn’t 
be able to do if he weren’t onsite.
And Joseph Farricielli, who was 
involved in the passage of the original 
regulations and says he himself is quite 
familiar with how regulations get written, 
asked those at the hearing to consider 
that changes made today “under the best 
of intentions” to improve access may 
destroy the “high goals that were set in 
motion thiry-two years ago.” 
“There’s 
an 
analogy 
about 
regulations. 
Once 
you 
take 
away 
something or you reduce it sometimes 
it’s hard to bring it back.” he said. “It’s 
like a chair that has a short leg. You can’t 
add to it, you have to cut the other legs. 
And so as we start to eliminate or hack 
away at the regulations we may generally 
reduce the level of care.”

rs. Wolfson’s last bath took place 
at 2 a.m. the night before she died. 
After five weeks of controlled pain, 
her symptoms had begun to return, 
and CT Hospice upped the level of her 
narcotics. For the last two days of her 
life, she slept.
“I think in almost any facility other 
than CT Hospice they would have done 
that to her at the beginning and we 
would’ve all missed the opportunity to 
say goodbye,” Dr. Wolfson said.
But instead, after five weeks with 
her, Mr. Wolfson and his two children—
both in their forties, one living in 
California and working as a Hollywood 
producer and one finishing her doctorate 
in theater studies—took turns spending 
the night with her those last few days. 
And then one night in June of 
2005, as the nurses’ aides made their 
usual late night rounds, they asked Dr. 
Wolfson if he thought Mrs. Wolfson 
would like a sponge bath. He said yes, 
and at their encouragement he helped 
them bathe her. During that bath, the 
nurses saw signs that the end was near, 
and they gently informed Dr. Wolfson. 
He called his children and they came to 
CT Hospice to be with her.
That morning, as the sun slowly 
rose in the sky, orange and welcoming, 
and broke out across the water of the 
sound, turning it sparkling and new, the 
67-year-old Mrs. Wolfson quietly passed 
away. 
On 
a 
morning 
last 
April, 
approximately six years later, Dr. 
Wolfson rose to speak against the 
proposed regulations to hospice care at 
the public hearing. “I urge you not to do 
this,” he testified.
The gate to CT Hospice bears an image of the Tree of Life.
