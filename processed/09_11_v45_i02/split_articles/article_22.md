a flagship.”
In addition, staff members at CT 
Hospice argue that no one is stopping 
the other hospices from opening 
facilities under the old regulations if they 
feel they’re necessary, regardless of what 
may be written on websites or published 
in letters to the editor in newspapers 
such as the New Haven Register.
 “There has been misleading media 
insinuating that Connecticut Hospice 
has had a monopoly on inpatient hospice 
care and that in some way we have 
restricted access to patients and families 
in Connecticut. Let us all be honest in 
this room. Every hospice in Connecticut 
must provide inpatient level care in order 
to have their hospice license. There is 
access. Similar to Connecticut Hospice, 
no one has kept you from becoming 
licensed under [the current regulations],” 
said Susan Flannigan, director of hospice 
at CT Hospice, at the April hearing. “No 
one has denied the patients and families 
access to this level of care except your 
organization.”
For Dr. Wolfson, this particular 
part of the debate is in many ways not 
relevant. CT Hospice is about a twenty- 
to thirty-minute drive from his home. 
Still, he considers quality of care to be 
worth more than any commute.  
“I would’ve gone three hours if it 
had been necessary,” he said.
D
iana Stoianov ’13, one of the more 
than five hundred volunteers at 
CT Hospice, began her weekly shift as 
a volunteer by stopping in to check on 
a group of patients. At CT Hospice, 
four patients usually live together in 
one room, though any patient with an 
infectious disease is transferred to a 
private room to avoid contamination. 
Three of the four patients in the room 
she was checking in on were sleeping. 
She could hear them breathing with a 
death rattle—a gurgling, choking sound 
dying patients often make as saliva 
begins to accumulate in their throats—
but that wasn’t what surprised her. After 
almost two years of volunteer work she 
was quite accustomed to that sound.
What surprised her was the fourth 
patient in the last bed on the right, who 
was sitting in a chair watching the news 
on TV not in the hospice gown but 
instead in ordinary clothes. Stoianov 
was not used to seeing patients who 
were well enough to get out of bed—
usually if someone gets up on their own, 
she feels an almost automatic sense of 
alarm.
The patient was a middle-aged man, 
and she sat down to talk with him. She 
didn’t know what was wrong with him—
volunteers never are told why patients 
are dying, just that they are—but they

connected over a discussion of how 
ludicrous the news sometimes becomes. 
At the time of her visit, the revolution 
was taking place in Egypt, but the news 
station was broadcasting another piece 
about celebrities. They chatted for a 
while, something she said nurses would 
love to do with patients but never really 
have time for. And then it hit her.
The patient seemed to her like 
a “normal person,” and she was in a 
place filled with people who were more 
obviously dying. Across the room were 
patients struggling just to fill their lungs 
with oxygen, and she suddenly felt 
the need to be elsewhere, to be doing 
something other than sitting and talking 
with a man who seemed just fine. She 
turned to the patient, told him it was 
nice to meet him, and got up to leave. 
“It was nice meeting you too,” he told 
her. “Stop by whenever you have time.”
As Stoianov walked out of the 
room, she looked back once more and 
saw the man, sitting in a room filled with 
people so sick they couldn’t interact with 
him at all, and she felt a new wave of 
emotion wash over her. She imagined 
how lonely and scared he must have been 
feeling at that moment, and though she 
continued with the rest of her volunteer 
duties—washing other patients, stopping 
to peek in other rooms, carrying out the 
trash—she couldn’t stop feeling guilty 
for leaving him behind.
The debate about the new proposed 
hospice regulations is really out of 
Stoianov’s 
realm—volunteering 
at 
hospice has been one of the formative 
experiences of her time at Yale, but 
when she graduates she does not plan 
to seek out hospice work. Volunteering 
at CT Hospice has been a singular 
moment in her life, Stoianov said, and 
she wants to do as much as she can in 
her four years of college before moving 
on to the next chapter. Part of her 
doubt about continuing to volunteer at 
a hospice hinges on the fact that she 
probably won’t stay in Connecticut after 
graduating, and she can’t really imagine 
volunteering somewhere other than CT 
Hospice. 
When Stoianov went back to CT 
Hospice to volunteer again, as coverage 
of Libya competed with news of the 
royal wedding, she stopped in on the 
patient she had once watched TV with. 
He was in bed, in the hospice gown, 
sleeping, and she didn’t disturb him. 
	
M
any of the arguments against 
the proposed regulations are 
emotional ones, Mahier said. People 
get so caught up, so worried, they don’t 
think about the facts, she added. 
“Everything 
that’s 
being 
said 
about how these regulations will lessen 
care, these are all not true. When we 
meet those negative statements, and 
when you look at the [Department of 
Public Health] who wrote them, and 
the twenty-eight hospices who support 
them, it is surprising,” Mahier said. “I 
guess it’s about not having competition. 
I don’t know what it is.”
The statements about the lowered 
quality of care are ones she classifies 
as troubling. “I’ve done this for twenty-
four years. Why would I ever want to do 
anything less than the best for someone 
who’s dying?” she said.
Gerard Lamoureux, a certified nurse 
aide at Regional Hospice, also thinks 
that concerns about lower standards are 
unfounded. “People keep talking about 
substandard care and lower levels of 
care and all that kind of stuff, and I don’t 
think Hospice-R-Us are going to start 
popping up on every corner with this 
regulation,” he testified at the hearing.
Still, even the most staunch 
supporters of the proposed regulations 
are the first to say that CT Hospice is 
a special place. The facility is, at first 
glance, undeniably beautiful. It is situated 
right near the Long Island Sound, and 
each patient bedroom has a massive 
glass window that looks out onto the 
water. There are multiple pianos, and 
music can often be heard floating down 
the hallways.

Through a wooden door carved 
with a tree—the Tree of Life—and 
down the hallway is a small chapel. 
Inside it is a wooden cross, fresh flowers, 
and pale light brown chairs on which to 
sit and pray. A large wooden table in the 
center contains a book filled with long 
strips of paper honoring patients who 
have passed away, with their names and 
words like “Rest in peace” and “We miss 
you” scrawled in cramped, loving letters. 
There is a swimming pool for kids to 
use in the summertime. Each day, the 
carpeting of the elevator is changed 
to display what day of the week it is in 
bright orange letters.
The words “I love you” are painted 
onto one white wall of the cafeteria 
in a myriad of bright colors, over and 
over again in many different languages. 
On another wall, in bold blue letters, is 
written, “Love matters. Hospice nurses 
are #1.” 
Each patient is given a brightly 
covered afghan, made by CT Hospice 
employees, upon arrival, Gonsalez said. 
The afghans can be seen everywhere, 
draped across the low sofas that line 
the hallways, positioned at the end of 
a patient’s bed, or nestled around a frail 
pair of shoulders, a brilliant splash of 
color against pale, translucent skin.
But it’s not just the facilities 
themselves that set CT Hospice apart; 
it’s also the services they offer, the care 
they give to each and every patient.
“CT Hospice has found a way to 
institutionalize love,” Dr. Wolfson said.
A 
few hours after her arrival at CT 
Hospice, Mrs. Wolfson and her 
husband attended a concert, hands 
clasped together. That concert was the 
first of many Mrs. Wolfson attended. 
Though her broken arm limited her, she 
participated in other arts programming 
that CT Hospice offered as well. Her 
own rabbi came to visit her often, but 
she still also participated in the spiritual 
counseling provided by CT Hospice, 
lighting Shabbat candles one Friday 
evening with an evangelical minister 
after he offered to pray with her.
Arts programming and spiritual 
counseling will not be as strictly 
mandated 
under 
the 
proposed 
regulations. Currently, arts programming 
at CT Hospice is taken very seriously. 
There is a full time director, seven paid 
staff, including clinical therapists, and 
forty volunteers, and services are offered 
every day of the year. 
“More 
and 
more 
healthcare 
organizations across the country are 
introducing art and music therapies as 
their advantages become more widely 
known. In contrast, the proposed 
regulations make arts therapies an 
afterthought barely mentioned as a 
remote option under complimentary 
therapies,” testified CT Hospice arts 
programming 
director 
Katherine 
Blossom at the hearing.
Mahier said that though arts 
programming may not be written into 
the regulations, it is still an important part 
of Hospice Southeastern Connecticut. 
“We’ve had an arts room where little 
kids come to work through grief since 
2003,” she said. “It’s integral to what we 
do.” 
But others worry that not every 
hospice will follow through without a 
regulatory mandate.
 “My experience with regulation—
I’ve done other studies as well—is 
actually if you leave it loose, there will be 
some providers will go for the low road 
on that. If you leave it loose, if you say, 
‘Oh it’s up to you if [your] patients want 
arts,’ there will be lot of hospices that 
don’t do it,” Bradley said. 
 Physical therapy isn’t mentioned 
much in the new regulations either, but 
it too was of great importance to Mrs. 
Wolfson. Initially, she could barely get 
out of bed, but after a week or two, she 
was able to take her first steps again. 
Soon, she could walk ten or fifteen feet, 
with her husband trailing behind her 
with a chair so she could sit down when 
she got tired.
 “For someone who is clearly dying, 
this is something that is not necessary, 
but she felt so good about being up,” 
Dr. Wolfson said, highlighting what 
Bradley sees as one of the biggest 
misconceptions about hospice care.  
“A lot of people in the public think 
hospice is the place you go to die,” 
Bradley said. “I think it’s much more 
true that it’s a place to live for the days 
you have left.”
rs. Wolfson was in intense pain 
when she arrived at CT Hospice. 
But within a half-hour of transfer, she 
was very nearly pain free. She was well 
enough to host three parties, one of 
which featured a performance of “You 
Are My Sunshine” by the nurses aides 
who gave her baths, and she was well 
enough to spend time with the hundreds 
of friends who came to visit over the 
course of her five week stay. 
Mrs. Wolfson was given relief so 
quickly because at CT Hospice, a history 
is taken and physical completed by a 
physician within twenty minutes for 
every single one of the three to four 
patients that are admitted each day. The 
new regulations state that the initial 
assessment of a patient should be done 
within forty-eight hours.
“I can’t tell you how critical this is,” 
Bradley said. “Ten to fifteen percent of 
patients will be dead in forty-eight hours. 
[The initial assessment] should be done 
immediately. Forty-eight hours of pain 
when you have terminal cancer? That’s 
out of control. That’s inhumane.”
When asked, Mahier was quick 
to point out that the regulations don’t 
mean patients who need to be seen 
immediately won’t get seen. “It’s standard 
wording,” she said. If every patient had 
to wait forty-eight hours, then the quality 
outcomes of the hospice facility would 
be poor, and the new regulations would 
mean that facility would have to make 
changes. 
Wodatch added that the facility 
has forty-eight hours unless a patient, 
representative, or physician requests 
an expedited time frame, and said that 
immediate needs would also mean 
an immediate assessment under the 
Medicare Conditions of Participation, 
which all hospice facilities across the 
states are required to follow. On the 
other hand, if a patient is not in great 
need, such as a patient living at home 
who would like some hospice assistance, 
an immediate assessment would not be 
necessary, she said.
Another component of hospice 
care that was extremely important to 
Mrs. Wolfson’s well-being in her final 
weeks was the availability of an onsite 
pharmacy so that medications could be 
quickly and adequately administered, Dr. 
Wolfson said.
Proponents say that just because 
there isn’t a pharmacy onsite doesn’t 
mean hospice patients won’t have access 
to medication right away.
Robert 
Tendler, 
a 
consultant 
pharmacist employed by Omnicare 
Company, the nation’s largest provider 
of prescription medications to patients 
in long-term care settings, said he has 
attended 1,200 inter-disciplinary hospice 
team meetings, and simply doesn’t see the 
need for an onsite pharmacy. “I believe 
it would force the cost of maintaining 
inpatient services to skyrocket without 
a realistic benefit to the patient,” he 
testified at the April hearing.
Mahier 
doesn’t 
think 
they’re
