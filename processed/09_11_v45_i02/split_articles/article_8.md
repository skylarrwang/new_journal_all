“Theater is about connecting,” 
Mary L. Pepe, the former Chairwoman 
of the Board of Trustees at the Long 
Wharf Theatre, told an audience of 
250 gathered on Friday, June 3. The 
night’s event, a gala fund-raiser for the 
nonprofit theater, was also a tribute to

“Sorry, officer, I thought they 
were my American Spirits.” Carrying 
the wrong kind of cigarettes last 
spring meant a one thousand dollar 
fine, possibly jail time, and certainly a 
misdemeanor on your criminal record. 
Caught again? Try a felony.


On June 7, the Connecticut House 
of Representatives gave final approval to 
SB 1014, a marijuana decriminalization 
bill that reduces the penalty for 
possession of less than half an ounce of 
cannabis (about fifteen cigarettes) from 
a misdemeanor to an infraction. A first-
time offense now carries only a $150 fine 
while a subsequent offense rises to five 
hundred dollars. For the most bullish 
reformers, however, the bill is a mixed 
bag. Cannabis remains illegal on the 
books. An offender under 21 may now 
find her driver’s license suspended for up 
to sixty days. And a three-peat at any age 
now results in automatic enrollment in a 
drug treatment program at the offender’s 
expense.


The law only applies statewide, 
and marijuana remains a Schedule I 
drug—illegal to manufacture, distribute, 
dispense, or possess—under the federal 
Controlled Substances Act. Actions of 
state lawmakers also caution against 
interpreting the bill’s passage as a sea 
change in values. By the time the State 
House of Representatives acted, the 
State Senate had already moved on to 
two separate bills. It approved by a vote 
of 34-2 a moratorium on new hookah 
lounges until Jan. 1, 2013, when the 
Connecticut Department of Health will 
release new, stricter regulations. Then 
it unanimously set the penalty for the 
possession of any quantity of synthetic 
pot at one thousand dollars and/or one 
year in jail.  


“For the life of me, I don’t know how 
I’m going to explain to my constituents 
one penalty for the fake pot and another 
for the real pot,” State Senate Republican 
leader John McKinney said.


Marijuana reform advocates agree 
that decriminalization is a step in the 
right direction. But decriminalization 
is also an awkward middle ground. 
Only full legalization, advocates say, 
can eliminate the stigma associated 
with marijuana use and take cannabis 
off the black market. In some ways, 
decriminalization is the least satisfying 
option to both prohibitionists and 
reformers—decriminalization preserves 
a taboo in name but reduces punishment 
to a slap on the wrist. 


The new law’s mixture of reform 
and prohibition reflects its contentious 
path to the governor’s desk. The State 
Senate deadlocked 18-18 over the final 
bill, requiring Lt. Gov. Nancy Wyman 
to cast a rare tie-breaking vote. The 
bill’s opponents accused Gov. Dannel P. 
Malloy of supporting decriminalization 
out of “personal interest” for his son, 
who had been convicted of selling 
cannabis in 2007 and robbing a Darien 
man of his pot at gunpoint in 2009. 


The bill’s vocal detractors included 
senators 
and 
assemblymen 
from 
conservative Fairfield County. But their 
familiar refrain of “What will we tell the 
kids?” didn’t provoke comparable moral 
urgency from the bill’s proponents. 


Those in favor of the bill cited the cost 
of criminalization to the state rather than 
ideas of personal liberty or opposition 
to a “prohibitionist” attitude. 


Malloy repeatedly characterized the 
bill as “common sense reform.” 
“We are not making marijuana 
legal,” he clarified after the Senate passed 
the bill. “We are not allowing people 
who use it and get caught to avoid the 
repercussions.”


Criminalization of small amounts 
of marijuana simply “does more harm 
than good,” he said.


Advocates for decriminalization 
bills often cite the social stigma of 
marijuana possession. Police arrest about 
seven thousand people every year for 
possession of less than half an ounce, 
and many of those arrested do complete 
programs to wipe their conviction from 
their permanent record, according to the 
legislature’s Office of Fiscal Analysis—
but removing the more private effects of 
arrest proves more difficult. Connecticut 
lawmakers, however, cited economic 
arguments before worries of social 
stigma. They kept a narrow focus on the 
harm a criminal record can do to “future 
employment prospects.”


Proponents’ lack of vigor can be 
forgiven at a time of slender budgets, 
underfunded courts, and over-crowded 
prisons. Each dollar in the $900,000 of 
estimated savings from the bill is a dollar 
not taken from libraries, school lunches, 
and winter road maintenance. And fewer 
incarcerations means the lives of two 
thousand more men and women will be 
uninterrupted by the blunt instrument 
of prison.


Malloy has promised to introduce 
legislation in the coming year to protect 
medical cannabis users, and legalization 
advocates have the demographics and 
momentum for legalization on their 
side. The question now is whether 
legalization in Connecticut will happen 
for the right reasons. If this summer is 
any instruction, when legalization comes 
to Hartford it will be wearing a business 
suit with red ink on its mind. 


But its pocket square could be 
hemp.
