L
ights pulse in my peripheral 
vision. My eyes invent blobby 
white images, reluctant to give in 
to the darkness. No sound. Cold skin. 
Suddenly a wave of sensation, a slow 
prickling sweat that creeps through my 
torso, my face, my scalp. Then the nausea 
hits. I feel I’m going to retch, but at the 
same time I don’t know what part of my 
body I’d retch with. My only awareness 
is discomfort. As the sensation slowly 
disappears, so do I.
I experience death in a small, gray 
cubicle on the ninth floor of Veterans 
Hospital in West Haven, Conn. Nurses 
watch me through a video monitor; they 
shuffle papers and take notes. A blood 
pressure cuff squeezes my right arm 
and a pulse oximeter hangs from my 
left index finger. One of my IVs draws 
blood samples while the other drips 
saline solution and drugs into my veins. I 
see dull fluorescence when the blindfold 
is removed. I hear beeping machines 
when my earplugs are removed.
I still feel like I can’t quite…I don’t 
know how to look at…
Yeah, I can stand I think but I’d 
rather…sure, yeah I can answer the 
questions…
The researcher is cute. She recites 
without looking at her clipboard.
“Did you have any strange or 
unusual experiences?”
“Um, at one point I thought I was 
dead.”
“Did that worry you at all?” Her 
expression is a mix of surprise and 
concern.
“No, not really. The worst part was 
that I started singing a little song to 
myself, and then I thought, ‘Oh no, I’m 
dead but I can still think! I’m going to be 
stuck repeating this stupid song over and 
over forever!’ That worried me a little.”
She makes a note.
I 
am a human guinea pig for a 
schizophrenia research lab. In the 
last year I’ve been injected more than 
twenty times with different experimental 
substances: 
Salvinorin, 
THC, 
Canabidiol, Amphetamines, Iomazenil. 
Different doses, different combinations. 
I got into drug studies by a friend’s 
recommendation and an online search. I 
figured it was a quick way to make some 
money, and no scientific or humanitarian 
aims inspired my first trip. 
My part of the job is simple. Take 
drugs, sit there and ride out the effects, 
then describe how it felt. The researchers 
assign me cognitive tasks, like repeating 
long lists of numbers backwards or 
pressing colored blocks on a computer 
screen. Often I wear an EEG cap or a
sensory deprivation mask. Always I get 
stuck with needles. Sometimes I lose my 
mind. 
I’m not always sure whether these 
drugs might some day be used to treat 
schizophrenia, or whether they’re meant 
to induce short-term schizophrenia in a 
healthy subject who can wake up and tell 
the researchers what it was like. 
It would be easy to say that I 
continued to do drug studies for the 
money. I can make over forty dollars 
an hour to trip. But even the nurses 
who’ve been working in the lab for years 
tell me that my desire to come back is 
prodigious. The drugs aren’t fun, and 
as I learned more about the debilitating 
and mysterious nature of the disease, 
the possibility of being permanently 
affected by these experiments worried 
me. A little. 
Besides the fact that I like the nurses, 
the bus ride to the hospital, and the free 
physicals, I do it for a voice that I miss. 
I used to hear it in my head when I was 
a child; it had a kind of intonation I’ve 
never heard in real life—a combination 
of gravel and black tar—a bottomless 
dark voice that emanated from behind 
my neck, that wrapped around my skull. 
I could understand what he was saying 
as he spoke, but as soon as he stopped 
I lost the message, like a dream that 
instantly fades.
y nerves light up in an instant, 
then I savor the slow decline 
of adrenaline, feel it dripping away 
throughout my system. “Does that feel 
O.K.?” the nurse asks me. Sometimes it 
does, but my veins are tricky. Often the IV 
doesn’t stick, and I can feel the pressure 
from the saline solution building up in 
my arm, filling cavities and tissues where 
it doesn’t belong. Finally we get the IVs 
to work, tapping veins on the backs of 
my hands.
Sensory deprivation again, and this 
time I watch as the two-dimensional 
darkness in front of my eyes shifts, gains 
a third dimension.  A silver city appears 
like fog rolling in. It stretches out in a 
grid of clear porcelain and stainless 
steel, and suddenly I’m not alone. I feel 
my companion like I used to feel ghosts 
as a child, the ones that made me open 
doors all the way to make sure nothing 
was behind them, the ones that made me 
back up into walls just to be sure nothing 
was following me. But this companion 
is friendly. We move through the city, 
punching from point to point on a stiff 
grid, forward one block, left, forward, 
forward. We are both in control, we 
don’t use words.
Finally we escape the reflective 
canyons and empty streets. We summit 
a hill. But the world is disintegrating 
already, burning off into blackness. I feel 
a touch on my arm, a real touch. It’s time 
to come back.
’ve been fascinated by schizophrenia 
since I was a kid, listening to an NPR 
program in the car with my parents. I 
remember Scott Carrier’s melancholy 
narration: “A person’s soul should be 
like an ocean, but a schizophrenic’s 
soul is like a pool of rain in a parking 
lot.” He spoke about voices, people 
believing they are the devil, that all the 
evil in the world is their fault. Sisters 
and sons suddenly aren’t themselves, 
mothers have sex with angels. I haven’t 
gotten over the sense of wonder I felt, 
that people could have an idea of reality 
incongruous with everything around 
them. And the fear that our minds can 
turn against us so savagely.
After that I used to wait for insanity, 
sure it would hit any day. In a strange 
sadistic way I wanted it to happen. I 
wished I could sometimes say, “I can’t 
help it.” I watched kids in middle school 
who rode skateboards, spray-painted 
the walls, jumped on people’s backs, 
screamed in the hallway. They wore 
spikes and weird clothes, they listened to 
music I couldn’t understand. Everything 
about them seemed to be organized by 
some strange logic that was singularly 
their own. I wanted a similar compulsion, 
an inner force that I didn’t understand 
and was powerless to change. Being a 
sane, detached observer doesn’t really 
give you a flavor.
My mind has since hardened. I’ve 
lost the inner voice from my youth. 
Sometimes I don’t even hear the real 
voices around me. I’ve had friends 
sobbing in my arms while I counted 
ceiling tiles. I got a tattoo on my ribs 
and barely felt it. The world just doesn’t 
get to me, so I found a way to inject a 
different one. When I’m there I build 
cities, I meet people, I am a machine, I 
am part of it all. I don’t enjoy myself 
in the schizophrenic state, but I need 
the time I spend there. I try to find 
books to better understand what I’m 
experiencing, but I’m no scientist, so I 
end up mythologizing it even further, 
reading the theories of Julian Jaynes, the 
philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari, 
and the memoirs of Judge Schreber. 
But as with all forms of tourism, what 
I experience is far from the truth of the 
condition.
finish 
another 
of 
the 
endless 
questionnaires and sit in the hospital 
bed listening to the man in the next 
cubicle. He sounds middle-aged. As 
he responds to the same questions 
I’ve just answered, I realize he must be 
schizophrenic. I trace the contours of 
his mind with every detail he gives that 
seems strange. His answers droop with 
exhaustion and seethe with characters he 
can’t escape. I can understand him only 
when he gets emotional and raises his 
voice. “…Nothing works for me…bad 
man in Hamden…I feel worthless…
My brother made it and I didn’t!” He 
mentions the multitude of voices he 
hears every day. He talks about them like 
they exist. He says they hate him.
At the end of the day the man is 
asked to rate his day on a scale of one 
to ten, with ten being the worst day of 
his life. He gives it a seven. I munch my 
sandwich and ask the nurse if I can sign 
up for another study.
