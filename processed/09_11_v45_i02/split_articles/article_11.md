The Transition
Michael Cutler, 44, has a leathery 
face and a limp and comes from the old 
vanguard of coffee-shop patrons. He 
believes the shops exist for storytelling 
and tall, black cups of joe. Most days, he 
sets himself down at the Starbucks on 
the corner of High and Chapel streets in 
New Haven. His table has a view of the 
entire shop. 	
The Starbucks that Cutler frequents 
is half a block from the center of Yale 
and one full block from the New Haven 
Green, where many of the city’s homeless 
population fall asleep each night. It is 
less than a block from the front steps 
of the Yale Repertory Theatre, where 
Cutler spent his first night on the street 
tucked beneath a garbage bag with issues 
of the New Haven Advocate and Play for 
a mattress. Cutler was homeless until 
March of this year.	
Cutler first became homeless in 
2004 after losing a job making calls at 
Lester Telemarketing in Branford. He 
had lived for a while at Valley Motel on 
Route 80 in Guilford but could no longer 
pay for the room. He bought a tent at 
Walmart for twenty dollars with his first 
unemployment check and pitched it in 
East Rock Park for two years. 
In 2006, Cutler served three months 
in Bridgeport Correctional Facility for 
failure to appear in court on larceny 
charges. (He says he was house-sitting 
for a friend whose credit card was stolen 
by another friend he invited over.) He 
spent the following years living with 
family and friends and did mandatory 
volunteer work at a furniture co-op. 
September 2010 found Cutler on the 
street again. 
 “Most people are just a paycheck 
away,” he said.
Last winter, Cutler participated 
in a program called Abraham’s Tent.


Columbus House, the city’s largest 
homeless 
shelter, 
developed 
the 
program in winter 2010 when it filled 
its beds—100 shelter, 110 overflow, 
thirty-five temporary—and still had 
men and women lining up outside. 
Abraham’s Tent was designed to aid 
twelve homeless men, chosen for work 
ethic and cooperative behavior, in the 
transition to independent housing. For 
each of the coldest sixteen weeks of the 
year, a different church or community 
group provides the men with food, 
shelter, and the company of volunteers. 
“This was about a very safe space 
for the participants to do what they need 
to do—get a job, meet other people,” 
said Columbus House director Allison 
Cunningham. “Last year, we made it a 
clear part of the program that we don’t 
want them back.”
Cutler’s, so far, is a success story for 
the program. 	
Yale students hosted Abraham’s 
Tent this February 21 through 27 
at Christ Church on Temple Street, 
in a large mint-green hall. Evenings 
that week, Cutler played gin rummy, 
chatting with the volunteers and looking 
occasionally at his hand. 
The other eleven men of Abraham’s 
Tent nicknamed Cutler “Mom.” He has 
shoulder-length brown hair and plays 
cards by the rules. 
A friend of Cutler’s, also in the 
program, was called “Dad”—Cutler’s 
counterpart and an avid cook. He kept 
one bag with him at all times. Besides 
folded 
socks, 
underwear, 
and 
an 
umbrella, it contained a pepper grinder, 
an ice cream scoop, homemade Cajun 
spice, small and large crystallized sea salt, 
garam masala, and tumeric.
The two homeless men had been 
friends for years. They met on the New 
Haven Green. Cutler’s current Fountain 
Street apartment, his first home in two 
years, is paid for by a grant arranged by 
his Columbus House caseworker from 
the federal Homelessness Prevention 
Rapid 
Re-Housing 
Program 
(HPRP). The grant will pay his first 
six months’ rent, until September 30. 
After September 30, if Cutler makes 
six hundred dollars a month, he will 
be allowed to stay in the subsidized 
apartment, covering one-third of the 
rent himself. If he doesn’t make that 
much, he will lose the funding. 
Cutler was recently employed about 
thirty-two hours a week by Clean Team, 
which works in beautification projects 
downtown as part of Town Green 
Special Services. He was let go a few 
weeks ago. He says he called in sick and 
the company never received his call so 
held him responsible for missing work.
He now is unemployed again, with 
his roof once more at risk.
On the day Cutler moved in this 
March, he went to his usual Starbucks, 
hopped on the B2 bus and walked to the 
apartment manager’s office on Fountain 
Street. Lisa Cuomo, the building 
manager, jingled a set of keys as he 
turned the corner into her office.
Cutler sat down, crossed his legs, 
and leaned toward the lease on the table, 
reading it eagerly. 
Laundry is available on every floor.
“Yeah, yeah, yeah.”
Guests must park on the street.
“Yeah, that’s fine.”
No pets.
“Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, nah, I 
wouldn’t, darling, nah, none of those.”
Later that day, Cutler left his new 
apartment just as he had found it. He 
slung the heavy backpack he had brought 
but did not unpack over a shoulder and 
surveyed the three rooms with bare walls 
and empty cupboards. He caught the B2 
back downtown and got off a few blocks 
from his table at Starbucks.
“I’m an addict,” he said. “Ask 
anyone. I was there at 6 a.m. this 
morning. I think I need rehab. I think I 
was there five times.”
Employees at the coffee shop 
know Cutler for the stories he tells. 
While participating in Abraham’s Tent 
this February, he and others often told 
a story of a woman passed out on a 
New Haven street. The story changed 
with each retelling in the green room at 
Christ Church. Sometimes the woman 
was young, sometimes old. She was on 
a bench or on the ground. The program 
participants did agree on the story’s end: 
No one helped the woman, and she was 
inches from death. 
“You come out of the womb,” 
Cutler said, “and doctors slap you on 
the butt, and you carry on with as much 
moral correctness as you can. Don’t hurt 
women or animals. Don’t be a scumbag.”
