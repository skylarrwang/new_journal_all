The irrelevance of immigration status in 
claims for unpaid minimum wages or 
overtime, other cases involving backpay 
for unlawful termination may require 
disclosure of a worker’s legal status in the 
country. Hayre says that complications 
arise when a court tries to sentence a 
business owner. If the complainant 
argues that he or she was illegally fired, 
normally the court will order the owner 
to re-hire that person. However, in a case 
where the plaintiff is not a documented 
resident or does not have papers 
allowing him or her to work in the 
United States, it is equally impossible to 
order a business owner to break the law 
again by hiring such a worker. Hayre says 
that until the threat of deportation fades 
away, undocumented immigrants will 
never be able to fully feel comfortable 
coming forward with complaints about 
workplace violations. “Who am I to say 
risk everything [to speak up]? Honestly, 
I’d probably make the same decision,” 
she says of the workers who decide to 
remain silent. 

For Aranda, who is undocumented 
yet came forward anyway, the specter of 
deportation paled next to her desire for 
justice. She acknowledges that owners 
are aware of how much they can exploit 
immigrants, but says that there should be 
a level of respect given to all workers, 
regardless of their status. “I would say to 
the people who are afraid [of speaking 
out] that we are human, too. In spite of 
this little paper…we are human, too.”
“¡El pueblo unido, jamás será vencido! 
The people, united, will never 
be defeated! El pueblo unido…” One 
hundred demonstrators shout together, 
alternating languages, in front of New 
Haven’s City Hall. There are not as many 
reporters present as the organizers had 
hoped for, but their mission—to stop 
traffic in the center of the city in honor 
of International Workers’ Day on May 
1—grows more successful with each car 
that has to detour around the crowds. 

The demonstrators march from City 
Hall to the hospital and back again. They 
ask for paid sick days, better immigration 
laws, education reform, and the end to 
in the service industry. John Ziebell, a 
New Haven resident, showed up to the 
May Day Workers Rally with his 7-year-
old son Ben to hold a sign reading, 
“American Jobs for Americans First.” 
He pointed to the three puppets made 
by Unidad Latina and the New Haven 
Workers Association and said, “None 
of those puppets are white. It’s not fair, 
it’s not right…It’s taking my job and the 
job of other Americans.” Ziedell said his 
own family immigrated to the United 
States from Germany three generations 
ago, and he has worked hard to earn his 
living since then. 

But despite the disagreements over 
undocumented immigrants in all other 
aspects of American life, laws regarding 
the workplace and specifically the Fair 
Labor Standards Act stipulate that, once 
hired, undocumented immigrants have 
rights, too. “In the United States, at least 
in the ideal version of it, we believe 
there has to be a certain basic floor of 
standards,” says Hayre of New Haven 
Legal Aid. Moreover, when complaints 
are filed, the legal burden of proof falls 
on the employer, so even undocumented 
immigrants who have been intimidated 
out of saving records of their pay are 
able to file a claim. 

Often, workers, Aranda and Reyes 
included, are surprised to find out how 
much protection they have without 
formal legal status in the United States. 
But Hayre says that it is not just a matter 
of workers understanding their rights—
even after she holds workshops to explain 
their rights to them, she receives very few 
complaints from men and women who 
are still employed. The job market is too 
difficult, and undocumented immigrants 
remain nervous about their status. It is 
often only once they quit or are fired that 
workers will show up in Hayre’s office. 
“Really what has to change is this climate 
of fear that surrounds undocumented 
immigrants in this country,” she says. 

It is a justifiable fear. Even with the 
protections, until a national immigration 
solution is reached, there will always 
be some level of risk for immigrants 
who come forward. While there are 
cases that establish a precedent for the 
the Iraq War all in the same breath, 
which makes one thing extremely clear: 
despite their vocal support for unity, 
these activists do not present an entirely 
united front. They are workers, yes, and 
they want change; but these are alliances 
born out of convenience and necessity, 
not common goals.

These alliances become necessary in 
a city the size of New Haven. Unlike New 
York City, New Haven has few worker 
centers able to pay specific employees 
to investigate allegations and lobby the 
government when wage theft cases like 
Aranda’s arise. This leaves New Haven 
with a landscape of activism that is far 
from full-time. Unidad Latina has no 
budget of any kind; it relies on donations 
to pay for the occasional rented space, 
and at the time of these interviews, was 
two months behind on those sporadic 
rent payments already. Besides the few 
nonprofit organizations and public 
interest lawyers who do exist, the search 
for justice is an after-hours pursuit. This 
means that the limited activists in the 
city unite at every opportunity. 

Alejandro Torres ’12, a member 
of Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de 
Aztlian, or MEChA, at Yale, marched 
May 1 with signs for the Workers 
Association and tried to connect it with 
the experiences of the students around 
him. “There are plenty of students, 
especially within MEChA, who have 
immigrant families, some of whom 
have been exploited,” he says. Alan 
Williams, 17, a student at Wilbur Cross 
High School who spoke at the rally 
in support of education reform, also 
agreed to lend his voice to the workers in 
a similar commingling of causes. “I feel 
we’re all struggling,” he says. “Workers, 
many of them are parents, so many of 
our struggles fall back on them.” “It’s 
a chain reaction,” agreed Jazlyn Ocasio, 
a 14-year-old who is also a student at 
Wilbur Cross.

Members of Unidad Latina and 
the New Haven Workers Association 
also joined in on chants in favor of 
better education and national peace as 
they made their way through the march, 
doing their part to contribute to other

Institutions engaging in wage theft 
and illegal employment practices are 
hard to spot from the outside. Cafe 
Goodfellas restaurant, for example, 
received a laudatory write-up for its food 
and service in The New York Times within 
a month of the Department of Labor 
filing claims against its owner on behalf 
of ten workers who had not been paid 
properly. The renowned Rocco’s Bakery 
still has lines out the door when it opens 
in the morning, despite the owner 
pleading guilty to criminal charges for 
his employment practices in January. 
Hayre, the attorney at New Haven Legal 
Aid, said, “It’s maddening, because it’s 
right under your nose.”

But if Megan Fountain, a co-
organizer of Unidad Latina, has any 
influence on the situation, that invisibility

causes. Meanwhile, the giant puppets 
that Aranda had spent hours creating 
were so large that they needed three 
people each to hold up their limbs. Their 
faces—a chef, an agricultural worker, 
and a construction worker—bobbed and 
weaved above the crowd throughout the 
afternoon.

The alliances between New Haven’s 
limited number of activists also means 
that the same people show up at very 
different events. Luis Luna, who hoisted 
a New Haven Workers Association sign 
above his head with one arm and pumped 
his fist with the other, spoke in favor of 
workers as he marched across the city. 
“I think we have to make a presence 
[in honor of May Day],” he said. “Most 
employers are paying a couple of dollars 
less [than they should] to the workers…
They have to realize that workers can’t 
live on minimum wage.” The last time 
that he had been quoted by a reporter, 
Luna was at a protest against police 
brutality and had filed his own complaint 
against the department for interfering 
with his right to videotape the actions of 
officers. 

Garaffa is among New Haven’s 
regular revolutionaries. He is also one of 
its many activists with a day job. Garaffa, 
who showed up in square glasses and a 
gray striped collared shirt with a phone 
in his front pocket, earns his paycheck 
as a software developer. During evenings 
and weekends, though, he is the leader 
of the local Party for Socialism and 
Liberation and was one of the original 
founders of the New Haven Workers 
Association. “I write software to pay 
my bills, but my purpose is activism and 
making the world better,” he says.

Garaffa was first drawn into the 
activism community in 2003 when he 
decided to join a protest against the 
Iraq War. Garaffa is often the one to 
give a pep talk to workers within the 
organization in an attempt to get them 
to attend a protest on behalf of another 
set of complainants. “Today we fought 
for you,” he tells them at the end of 
every case. “Tomorrow, we hope you’ll 
join us to fight for someone else.”

will soon change. She, along with other 
organizers from Unidad Latina and 
the New Haven Workers Association, 
held a press conference at the start 
of the summer to announce that the 
organization will spend the upcoming 
months coming up with a system 
to publicly announce and celebrate 
restaurants who do manage to achieve 
fair labor standards. She wants to prove 
that the commonly-held view that service 
industry businesses cannot afford to pay 
workers minimum wage and remain 
competitive is a myth. Ultimately, the 
organizers hope to convince lawmakers 
to pass a bill akin to New York State’s 
2010 Wage Theft Prevention Act. “We 
are not done transforming the restaurant 
industry in New Haven. This is just the 
beginning,” said Fountain.

Palma, who found a new job during 
his time protesting Downtown at the 
Taft, now spends far more hours with 
his family than he used to. He receives 
fair wages and is able to continue 
pursuing his passion for pastry-making. 
Yet despite his newfound gains, he is 
determined not to let anyone forget 
about what happened to him and his 
coworkers, and what happens to other 
workers in other places. “We started to 
find out that it doesn’t just happen to 
us, it happens to people around New 
Haven, around the country. It happens 
everywhere,” he says. 
“We are good people. We do the 
right thing. We have to fight for all of 
these people.”

Susan Wolfson had not had a bath 
in almost a month. A broken 
right arm—combined with large 
tumor masses in her abdomen that 
were obstructing her intestine, and 
one in particular that was pressing on 
the nerves to her right leg, causing her 
intense pain—meant that a bath was an 
almost insurmountable task. And for 
Susan Wolfson, that’s saying something.

Mrs. Wolfson was a lawyer known 
for getting things done. She began 
practicing law in 1976, and soon rose 
through the ranks, becoming President 
of the New Haven Bar Association, 
then the Connecticut Bar Association, 
and finally serving as an officer of 
the national family law section of the 
American Bar Association. The New 
Haven County Bar Association honored 
her with its lifetime achievement award 
posthumously in 2005. The award 
typically goes to someone who has been 
in practice for forty years, and she had 
worked for less than thirty. 	

Mrs. Wolfson was an expert at 
dispute resolution—if there was anyone 
who could keep clients filing for divorce 
out of a long, protracted, and costly 
court battle, it was she. She even helped 
found an alternative dispute resolution 
company, a mediation service called Sta-
