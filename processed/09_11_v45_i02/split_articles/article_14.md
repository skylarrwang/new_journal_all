The New Journal
N
o sign at The Institute Library 
urges visitors to keep their 
voices down, but there is little 
to tempt guests here from breaking usual 
reading room etiquette. The main floor is 
empty on a Friday in early August. Each 
of the oversized red chairs sits vacant 
in the back room of this second story 
library—an unlikely and unnoticeable 
fixture of Chapel Street’s cramped 
commercial row, nestled between a 
tattoo parlor and dated pawn shop.  
An enormous oriental rug was 
rolled out beneath the armchairs just 
days earlier—an invitation, so far 
unheeded, to venture back into the 
library and find a seat around its circular 
central table. Closer to the front, an 
old wooden card catalogue welcomes 
visitors (once they’ve rung the library’s 
buzzer and climbed up the narrow 
staircase that leads away from the street 
level’s bus stop bustle).  Most library card 
catalogues are preserved as quaint relics 
of the pre-digital age, but the miniature 
drawers at the Institute are still full—and 
still in use. 

Inside, the cards document the 
library’s inventory (thirty thousand 
volumes, with more packed and stored 
away in bags) and history (nearly two 
centuries of service in downtown New 
Haven). 

Though you might not guess it 
wandering among the Institute’s quiet 
shelves, the library has 345 current 
members, the most it’s had in fifty years. 
Rising membership is a point of pride 
for Will Baker, appointed the library’s 
new executive director in February. Just 
last year, the library faced near certainty 
of closure: buffeted by the economic 
crisis, the Institute’s tiny endowment 
seemed to be on its last legs. With only 
194 members (each paying a nominal 
twenty-five dollar fee), the library cut its 
hours drastically, opening for just over 
ten hours a week. These days, however, 
Baker is hard at work bringing the bustle 
back to the library, where objects are 
meant not just to be touched, but to be 
used. 

Baker’s timing might seem unwise. 
Symptoms of a print doomsday are 
everywhere: 
shuttered 
windows 
at 
the last-Border’s-standing, publishers 
struggling 
to 
deal 
with 
shifting 
technologies, 
Kindles 
and 
Nooks 
emerging out of purses and backpacks 
on the public bus. If the decline of the 
book is all but guaranteed, how can a 
tiny library like this hope to emerge from 
its own near-certain demise?
“If you think about libraries just as 
repositories of information,” says Baker, 
“then there is no reason for them to 
remain.”

The future of libraries, Baker 
believes, lies in their role as communities, 
not collections. The key to success is not 
keeping visitors quiet; it’s getting them 
talking.

B
aker’s new vision is of “library 
as place,” a buzzword among 
likeminded library enthusiasts. “Too 
often libraries are thought about only in 
terms of their physical collections: the 
books, journals, manuscripts, and other 
physical materials that line the shelves,” 
wrote Susan Gibbons, Yale University 
librarian, in an e-mail. “The creation 
and transmission of knowledge requires 
conversation and debate, and libraries 
were designed for that purpose.”

The New Haven Free Public Library 
hosted over one thousand community 
meetings last year, and typically offers 
four to five programs a week at the main 
branch, according to Cathleen DeNigris, 
the library’s deputy director.
“We try to offer as many varied 
speakers, workshops, and film series 
as we can,” she wrote in an e-mail. “I 
believe as we enter an age of e-books 
and instant online information, libraries 
as ‘places’ become even more important. 
Human beings are social entities and 
need spaces where they can come 
together with others, even if they are not 
interacting all the time.”

It’s a vision that fits nicely in the 
narrative of the Institute Library’s 
past. From its first meeting in 1826, 
the Library has been as much about 
talking—and sharing—as it has been 
about reading. 

In many ways, the creation of the 
library was unexceptional. Membership 
libraries, which require a small fee to 
make use of their collections, were 
unremarkable in an era that pre-dated 
the rise of public libraries. Likewise, the 
library’s pedagogical mission was also 
the product of a larger movement: the 
mobilization of the American middle 
class to seek out liberal arts education. 
Unlike other membership libraries 
and intellectual societies at the time, 
the 
Young 
Apprentices’ 
Literary 
Association, as it was originally called, 
was created without a jump-start from a 
wealthy patron and operated without the 
oversight of any experienced teachers. 
The eight founders, all “mechanics” or 
“clerks” (catch-all terms for blue-collar 
workers), pooled their resources—most 
likely, several good sets of reference 
volumes and canonical literature—and 
launched a quest for self-improvement 
on their own. At each meeting, 
members were required to read aloud 
an original piece of writing, killing two 
all-important birds (composition and 
declamation) with one stone. Any lazy 
student who forgot his homework was 
fined ten cents.  

Within a year, the founders had 
attracted the attention of educators 
and financiers willing to pitch in to 
support their venture. The club took the 
progressive step of opening its doors to 
women in 1835 and in 1841 was officially 
chartered by the state under its new name, 
The New Haven Young Men’s Institute 
(which still welcomed women). Within a 
decade, the library had become a bastion 
of inclusive and provocative discourse 
in the city. The intimate “seminars” of 
the library’s early days were replaced by 
a selection of three hundred classes. An 
ongoing lecture series featured esteemed 
speakers from the national Lyceum 
circuit, including Henry Ward Beecher, 
Charles Dickens, Ralph Waldo Emerson, 
and Herman Melville.  

 The library’s heyday, however, was 
short-lived. Financial woes in the wake 
of the Civil War weakened the Institute, 
which found itself on the peripheries of 
the debates it had once monopolized. 
When the New Haven Free Public 
Library opened in 1886, the Institute 
seemed destined for obsolescence. 
The premise of a membership library 
became antiquated at best, uninviting 
and—ironically, given the Institute’s 
humbles beginnings—elitist at worst.

Under William Borden, the librarian 
whose hundred-year-old handwriting still 
fills the catalogue’s most yellowed cards, 
the Institute turned inward. Many of the 
library’s most charming idiosyncrasies 
are the product of Borden’s unusual 
stewardship from 1887 until 1910.  
Contrary to the lofty pedagogy of the 
founders, he set out to turn the Institute 
into what Baker calls a “laboratory 
for library science.” A classmate and 
competitor of Melvil Dewey, father 
of the ubiquitous Dewey Decimal 
System, Borden designed an alternative

Just last year, the 
library faced near 
certainty of closure: 
buffeted by the 
economic crisis, the 
Institute’s tiny 
endowment seemed 
to be on its last legs.
