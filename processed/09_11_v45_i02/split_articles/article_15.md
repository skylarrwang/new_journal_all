(and, Baker notes, “very problematic”) 
classification system for organizing the 
library’s collection. Borden’s system uses 
a book’s date of acquisition as part of 
its organizational schema, a design flaw 
that ultimately discouraged expanding 
the library’s collection. To this day, it is 
used in no other known library—a dead-
end story that befits the library’s own 
declining trajectory. 

Baker pictures a “social space” at 
the Institute, which he thinks will 
thrive if it is filled with people—not, 
as Borden evidently hoped, simply 
because it is filled with books. To be 
sure, Baker shares much of Borden’s 
bookish obsession with the library and 
its collection: he received a Master’s in 
museum studies in 2004, and worked for 
William and Reese, a leading rare books 
company based in New Haven. Yet 
Baker is equally committed to what he 
calls “community-oriented work”—an 
ethos of literary engagement that sets his 
own directorship apart from Borden’s 
model of custodianship. In 2009, Baker 
enrolled in the library science program 
at Southern Connecticut University. 
That same fall, Baker visited the Institute 
Library for the first time—brought 
along by one of the library’s board 
members. Baker was instantly taken 
by the rich history of the library, and 
began investigating the Institute’s past 
as part of his own research. By the time 
his two years at Southern were over, he 
had befriended many of the Institute’s 
board members and was offered a newly 
created position as executive director.  
As part of his final project at 
Southern (before his directorship at the 
Institute), Baker mailed out a survey to 
all two hundred members at the time. 
Part of the fact-finding project solicited 
basic information: why members joined 
(everything from encouraging small 
libraries to “support[ing] Will Baker 
in all his endeavors”), how often they 
visited (less than four percent visited 
once a week or more), and how many 
books they borrowed (almost half had 
never checked out a book). 

The survey was also forward-
looking. Baker wanted to know what

members liked best about the library—
and what they thought stood to be 
improved. Their answers sounded a 
ringing note of approval for Baker’s 
vision of “library as place.” Users cited 
the literal space at the Institute as its 
most attractive feature—a “haven,” as 
one respondent wrote, “where one can 
focus and be productive.” They eagerly 
proposed introducing debates, game 
clubs, and instructional classes. The 
simple addition of coffee and tea was 
the most popular proposed change. 

T
he most worthy spirit of the library, 
Baker believes, can be found in 
the run-up to the Civil War, when 
the Institute was one of the few safe 
spaces for abolitionists to speak out 
in New Haven. (Uncharacteristically, 
Connecticut was a pro-slavery Northern 
state—the result, Baker surmises, of 
Southern business interest and the 
omnipresent legacy of Eli Whitney’s 
cotton gin.) 

Baker has a favorite story from the 
era. During the 1850s, an abolitionist was 
invited to speak at the Institute, ruffling 
the feathers of New Haven’s Southern 
sympathizers. Determined to derail the 
speech, one local copperhead interrupted 
the visitor and began to muster a mob 
of indignant audience members. As the 
gathering seemed poised to dissolve into 
violent disarray, an elderly woman stood 
up to denounce the young rabble-rouser. 
Following her principled lead, a handful 
of other library members surrounded 
the man and began pushing him away 
from the crowd. The old lady, however, 
insisted that he sit politely through the 
lecture—guaranteeing that he learn his 
lesson in the truest sense.    

Baker’s anecdote presents a kind 
of Holy Grail of social learning. The 
collective teaching of an old lady and 
a motley New Haven crowd suggests 
what civil discourse at its best can bring 
to those who agree to come together 
and talk together. Indeed, two-sided 
discourse is precisely what can get lost 
in an era dominated by the one-way 
transactions of the technological world.
The legend of the old lady isn’t the 
only one Baker likes to tell. “There are 
so many great stories that people have 
of while doing research in the library, 
pulling a book out and finding one they 
wouldn’t have encountered,” he says. “Or 
backing up into someone, and finding 
out they are working on complementary 
projects.” 

These serendipitous encounters, of 
course, only happen in well-trafficked 
libraries. 

Still, 
while 
membership 
has risen under Baker’s tenure, he 
acknowledges that recruitment efforts 
alone will not be enough to carve out a 
new and permanent niche for the library. 
The real grist of his agenda as Director 
will be to introduce new programming 
to the library—giving new members a 
real “reason for them to remain.” 

In the fall, many of the plans 
proposed by the library’s members will 
finally come off paper and into action. 
Baker hopes to launch the Institute’s 
first lecture series, on the theme of civil 
discourse—as he describes it, “civil 
discourse about civil discourse.” Book 
clubs and classes are also in the works, 
along with eight exhibitions of local 
artists.
“There’s great potential for the 
Institute Library to attract downtown 
people in for lunchtime programs or 
after work for discussions, book talks, 
etc.,” the public library’s DeNigris wrote.

Baker has plans for more avant 
garde performances as well; he hints at 
the possibility of bringing an old friend, 
“the last link to the last great generation 
of sideshow performers,” to put on his 
famous sword-swallowing act on the 
library’s second or third floor.  

Baker knows he is fighting an uphill 
battle. He admits that computers, not 
libraries, are the perfect “portals to 
information.” But accessing information 
isn’t the endgame of Baker’s brand 
of 
education. 
Engaging 
with 
information—not just reading books, 
but truly discussing them—is the far 
more difficult mission of good libraries 
and good librarians. The “portal” Baker 
envisions is more than a few clicks of 
the mouse away, but still, he believes, 
well within reach. The question now is 
whether anyone else is willing to climb 
through.
