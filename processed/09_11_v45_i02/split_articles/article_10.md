**Title: No Book, Feeling Blue**
**Author: Katharine Konietzko**
**Page number(s): 5-6**

On the train back from Bulldog 
Days, the whirlwind weekend tour of 
Yale for admitted students, one of 
my high school classmates pulled a 
thick blue book out of her bag to leaf 
through. Wide-eyed, I asked what it was. 
“Yale’s course book,” she said. “I 
think this might make my decision for me.”


I was given to poring over Yale’s 
promotional materials, so I knew the 
school offered over two thousand classes, 
more than seventy-five majors, and was 
basically a nerd’s heaven on earth. Still, 
having failed to pick up a copy of the 
Yale College Programs of Study myself 
during Bulldog Days, I felt a bit cheated. 
I knew I was missing something. 


When my first Blue Book arrived 
in the mail a few months later, I did 
what any over-eager pre-frosh (or, 
really, any Yale student) would do: I 
dog-eared, Post-It-noted, highlighted, 
and circled before starting to make my 
lists. I still have that first Blue Book, and 
my second. My classmate chose Yale. 


This September, newly appointed 
Registrar 
Gabriel 
Olszewski 
will 
decide with Dean Mary Miller when 
to discontinue the Blue Book, YCPS 
managing editor Laurie Ongley said. She 
said they will likely choose to eliminate 
the Blue Book next year or in 2013. Yale’s 
course catalog, first printed as a pamphlet 
in 1715, will be available only online. 


Yale students have had to preorder 
print Blue Books since summer 2010 
instead of receiving them automatically, 
with 
the 
expectation 
that 
some 
would use the online course selection 
system exclusively. As soon as the 
coming semester’s classes go live on 
Yale Online Course Information, or 
OCI, students update online statuses 
with announcements: “OCI is live—
don’t go through every department 
again this year.” Students await with 
equal eagerness the arrival of print 
Blue Books in the mail. The verb “to 
bluebook” is commonly used, as in: 
we 
start 
bluebooking 
immediately, 
and we do so obsessively. Words 
derived from the acronym OCI have 
been slower to enter the Yale lexicon.


Every course catalog since 1715 
is documented in Yale’s archives. 
Together, they trace Yale’s development 
as an academic institution. Centuries 
ago, students could tack electives in 
math or languages onto a syllabus of 
Greek and Latin giants and “natural 
philosophy.” The Manuscripts and 
Archives collection in Sterling Memorial 
Library holds the course listings dating 
back to 1822. The pages are soft and the 
print, gray. The books have been printed 
in the font now used since the 1940s.


Yale was teaching literature, history, 
and modern scientific theories by its 
bicentennial in 1901. Bacteriology and 
Military Science became majors by 1939. 
Eight years later, the Naval Science 
department joined their ranks, offering 
courses like Piloting and Navigation 
Amphibious 
Operations.

Senator Richard Blumenthal spoke 
on tensions in New Haven and Endel’s 
characteristic ability to transcend them.
“She shows us that there is no limit 
to the good you can do as long as you 
don’t care who gets the credit for it,” 
he said before he presented her with a 
certificate of honor from the Senate, 
which was, he joked wearily, “not doing 
a lot these days” in the midst of budget 
negotiations and nominations.


Though it is highly unlikely 
that Endel connects more people than 
Facebook, she can be compared to Long 
Wharf Theatre as a gracefully aging city 
fixture. She was born in St. Louis, grew 
up in Westchester County, N.Y., attended 
Connecticut College, and married her 
late husband, Charlie Endel, at 22. When 
they met, she was working at Kreary’s, 
a store in New York, and he was in the 
Coast Guard. They moved to the North 
Haven house where Endel has lived for 
56 years. Endel founded and served 
for twenty-five years on the Panel of 
American Women, a national advocacy 
group that addresses prejudice. She 
recently served as Vice President of the 
Urban League and helped in the creation 
of Creative Arts Workshop, a nonprofit 
center for arts education. 
“My 
mother 
speaks 
only 
in superlatives,” Patty Endel said. 
“Everybody is the best person, the 
greatest, the most interesting. At the 
surprise party it was so confusing for us 
to be in a room with two hundred people 
who were all the best.”


Louise Endel is busy, and 
runs on the adrenaline of constant and 
forceful engagement with the people in 
her life, many of whom gathered for 
the buffet dinner at standing tables to 
celebrate her landmark birthday. 


After 
a 
few 
minutes, 
Blumenthal ended his short address.
“Last night at the Quinnipac 
Club, I was coming down, and Louise 
was there celebrating her birthday,” he 
said. “The people she was with said 
‘Louise, we have to take the elevator,’ 
and she was already halfway up the stairs, 
looking back.”
