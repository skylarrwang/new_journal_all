EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
coverage also reminded Eustis of past 
promises: "2.132 years ago, he volunteered 
co [article writer Bill Gale] in an interview 
that he had pledged to stay at Trinity for 
five more years, to see through the upgrad-
ing he was beginning. You don't have to 
have gone to Yale University to see that half 
that commitment remains." 

However, the benefits of the publicity 
to Eustis were even more immediate. 
Bogart sums it up: "He used [the media 
coverage] brilliantly. It was a great political 
act." According to the jouma4 Trinity's 
board "met with Eustis after he had talked 
with Yale," agreed to an early contractual 
salary increase, "and recommitted their 
support of some of his favorite projects at 
the theater, including higher salaries for 
actors and others, more warehouse and 
shop space, a program with Brown 
University, and an increased emphasis on 
Trinity's training arm, the conservatory." 

The public relations bonanza provided by 
the newspaper coverage was topped off by 
a press conference at which Eustis 
announced that he would not be accepting 
the job from Yale. "It is unusual for some-
body to publicly announce that they're 
declining an offer," observes H aller. This 
peculiar PR choice was accompanied by an 
attempt to play up the importance of his 
current job. He said that he hoped his 
rejection of Yale would "let a lot of people 
here recognize that we have a national 
jewel, one of the top places in the country." 

While an early salary increase may 
seem to be a strong benefit of the media 
coverage, sources say Yale was offering even 
more. A more important advantage is 
revealed by Eustis's language at the press 
conference, in his previous words regarding 
the Trinity Repertory Company, and in the 
projects to which his board recommitted. 
At the press conference, Eustis observed, 
"The [Trinity] conservatory is very good 
now, but in five years I want people rurn-
ing down Julliard, Yale, and NYU to come 
here." By connecting Brown to Trinity in 
the same way that Yale is connected to the 
Yale Rep, Eustis hopes to move his theater 
into Yale's place at the top of the American 
theater scene, a goal he set at the start of his 
tenure. 

Eustis's CONTENTION IS SIMPLE: "Yale 
Rep is not a better theater than Trinity 
Rep." While Yale's offer of the deanship to 
Eustis may have inadvertently strengthened 
one the University's competitors in the 
world of drama, many remain skeptical 
about 
Eustis's 
statements. 
Wildman 
believes that "five years is an awfully short 
timetable to get from nowhere on the map 
to the top of the map. I think it's entirely 
possible that they could emerge as another 
exciting program, but that quickly, I don't 
know." Still, many already see the transi-
tion taking place. "[Trinity is] in better 
shape than the Yale Rep," believes Bogart. 
"Oskar's put it back on the map." 

More importantly, many say Yale's rep-
utation bas declined overall. "As in any the-
ater school, it has its ups and downs, and I 
think it's more in a down than an up right 
now," says Bogart. "Probably the strongest 
program is design, and I think that people 
will go for management and take it serious-
ly, and dramaturgy bas a good reputation, 
and technical theater has a great Â£eputa-
tion, but the rest of the school and the Rep 
have slipped." The committee was also 
concerned about just such a slip. "The 
committee certainly was not unaware of 
the perception about the stature of the 
school and repertory theater and certainly 
... subscription rates to the Yale Rep have 
declined," admits Haller. "In a competitive 
sense, the school wasn't 100 percent the 
way people wanted it. There was a dear
