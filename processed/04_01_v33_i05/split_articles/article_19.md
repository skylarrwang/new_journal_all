vacism, the <4T announcement was the 
perfect plug: industry, government, NCO, 
and academy working rogether and ignor-
ing self-imerest co find a humanitarian 
solution ro an international problem. And 
Yale and Bristol-Myers had emerged from 
the fray with no sign of injury: Neither had 
actually forfeited anything in the way of 
profits, they had avoided a potencial PR 
debacle, and, in the process, chey had taken 
the issue away from the activist communi-
ty. In a March 19 op-ed in Th~ Nnv York 
Ttm~s. Or. Prusoff concluded, "I find ic 
hard to see any pattern in all chis, except 
perhaps chat there is a moral urge among 
people that, however coincidentally, can 
sometimes bring results." 

Ac Yale, meanwhile, student interest in 
the issue was coming to 
a peak. 
Kapczynski, Simons, Avid, and a number 
of ocher students planned a "reach-in" to 
educate beyond the headlines. On April 2, 
over 250 students, professors, and other 
members of che community crowded into a 
room in Linsly-Chiccenden Hall. The 
speakers represented every element of the 
struggle chat had led co the Yale-Bristol-
Myers decision. Kasper spoke on the pan-
demic in Africa, highlighting the need for 
affordable medicine. HIV-positive South 
African activists added a personal note. 
Asia Russell, who works for ACT-UP 
Philadelphia, accused the us of "driving a 
coalition which was actually killing people 
with AIDS" and denounced this "state-sanc-
tioned genocide," proclaiming, "They did 
chis because we demanded it." Balamuth 
discussed Yale's patenting and licensing 
policy, calling for a greater role for 
researchers in such decisions, and high-
lighting GESO's commitment co the issue. 
Kapczynski matter-of-faccly described the 
negotiations process. The lefty crowd, 
arriving lace from the most recent anti-Free 
Trade Area of the Americas protest, extend-
ed an open invitation to the AIDS activists 
to join them on a trip to Quebec City for 
the April 2.0 anti-globalization protest. 
There was a dizzying array of "actions" to 
take, wcbsices to consult, lists co sign, and 
people co contact. But even as the offshoots 
of the original campaign multiplied, those 
initially involved were not sure what their 
next step should be. 


IN 
THE MONTH SINCE Yale and Bristol-
Myers made their announcement, the 
effects have rippled. Yale has pledged its 
continued commitment to improving 
access to AIDS treatinent in Africa: At an 
open forum in early April, 
~ 
President Richard 
Levin 
called for "a significant effort 
by Yale to help train people 
to administer 
[d4T) 
in 
Africa" and claimed, ''I'm 
very committed to this." 
CESO has kicked off an effort 
to give researchers more 
voice in how their discoveries 
are patented and licensed. 
Student radicals have added 
access to AIDS medicine to 
their agenda. The media's 
fascination with AIDS in 
Africa has become, if any-
thing, more intense; a recent 
lead article in Th~ Nnu York Dr. Prusoff 
Ttm~s highlighted the continued problem 
of access to essential medicines, issuing an 
implicit calJ to sustained action. Students 
at other major universities--most notably 
the University of Minnesota, which licens-
es the patent for another important AIDS 
drug to GlaxoSrnithKline--have raken up 
the sort of fight first seen at Yale last 
month. And in early April, at the behest of 
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, six 
major pharmaceutical 
firms-Bristol-
Myers Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, 
Abbott, Hoffinan-Laroche, and Boehringer 
Ingelheim-dedared their commitment to 
lowering prices and malcing AIDS drugs 
more widely available and affordable in the 
neediest portions of the developing world. 
But the people who hastened the 
change at Yale are cautious in their celebra-
tion. In fact, at this point, they are not even 
sure what the decision meant. "We don't 
know what the outcome is," Kapczynslci 
admitted. T he OCR has only said chat it 
amended the licensing agreement with 
Bristol-Myers. "An exclusive license ensures 
that a company is diligent in marketing a 
product and doesn't just put it on the 
shelf. â€¢ Soderstrom explained. "In order to 
do this, certain restrictions are put on the 
agreement-we had to remove those 
restrictions." Bristol-Myers, in addition to 
APRIL :2.0, :2.001 
offering drugs to UNAIDS and the World 
Health Organization at a reduced (but still 
far higher than generics) cost, has merely 
pledged not to fight back if the patent is 
violated. "This is a big step forward and it 
has a lot of possibili-
ty," Kasper said. "But 
drug companies often 
make very grandiose 
announcements and 
don't do anything on 
the ground." 

For the moment, 
Kapczynslci, Simons, 
Avid, and ocher con-
cerned students are 
taking minor steps 
and doing their best 
to get their bearings. 
They are examining 
"the systematic prob-
lem of research being 
so closely tied to corpo-
rate interests", convening a forum (with 
some coaxing by the dean of the law 
school) to educate themselves on how the 
licensing process works, and in the prelim-
inary stages of creating some sore of 
University-wide AIDS coalition. Still, Avid 
said, "None of us know exactly how chis 
works or where it's going." And Kapczynski 
warned, "A lot of forruitious things worked 
together to make this successful, but the 
more this becomes replicable, the more 
resistance there will be." 
Amy Kapczysnlci, Marco Simons, and 
Sara Avid alighted on a wave of interna-
tional momenrum and directed it closer to 
home. Now, the wave is mosdy past them. 
But they all realize that "on the ground" 
nothing yet has been gained. And though 
all of this started on the ground, no one 
knows if that's where it will end.
