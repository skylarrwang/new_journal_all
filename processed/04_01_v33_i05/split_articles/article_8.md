EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
This magazine hits the stands April 20, amid two grand conver-
gences. Thousands of activists, including a coalition of Yale stu-
dents, workers, and homeless New Haveners, are leaving for Quebec 
City to protest the World Trade Organization's extension of unfettered 
trade across the Western Hemisphere. And hundreds of Yale's most 
illustrious alumni, including the elder President Bush, are arriving here 
to celebrate our tercentennial.


No doubt both events will be characterized by a lot of rhetorical 
arm-waving about their historic significance. But I, for one, would like 
to know which moment will prove more momentous, since I can only 
be in one place at one time.


A phrase that's been swimming around in my head for the last few 
months is "the myopia of the present"-in other words, the illusion that 
all points of time, space, and importance converge just before one's 
nose. I think that students at an elite university are especially suscepti-
ble to this optical illusion, being young, coddled, and flattered by fre· 
quent references to their school in connection with politics and litera-
ture and important scientific discoveries. Dan Kurtz-Phelan's story in 
this issue explores just such a flattering Yale connection. At a certain 
point in the fight to bring cheaper AIDS drugs to Africa, a quiet cam-
paign at Yale was instrumental in securing the release of a patent it 
held on the drug d4T. But what happens next? As Dan points out, 
nobody really knows.


Which brings me to the kind of myopia I would like to be able 
to justify: the myopia of a bunch of writers with journalistic inclinations 
publishing a student magazine about Yale and New Haven. Recently 
we got the chance to meet Daniel Yergin, who founded The New 
Journal in 1967. He spoke on a tercentennial panel titled "Defining 
Moments at Yale." With an asymmetry perhaps meant to be dynamic, 
half the speakers addressed themselves to events before 1900, and the 
other half talked about the late 1960s. Yergin brought some early 
copies of the magazine and described his and his friends' attempts to 
record and respond to a moment of unprecedented upheaval, the 
"Kingman Brewster Years" of coeducation, countercultural protests, 
and the Black Panther trial. While the battle lines may be less firmly 
drawn for our generation, some of us still aspire to the same sharp-
ness of focus.

ception that needle exchange is just about 
needles. It connects people to all kinds of 
services. And it connects them to people," 
Maria explains. 
Martha came in next. She asked for 
some clean needles and shuffled around for 
a few seconds, hiding inside her big black 
puffy jacket. Mack, a haem reduction work-
er, asked her how she was doing. She rolled 
up her sleeves and held out both of her 
palms to Mark and Maria. "See, I don't 
know what ~ese ace. The doctor said it was 
nothing, but ' I didn't tell him about the 
crack. It really hurts," she said quickly, 
pointing to conspicuous, oddly shaped 
bumps on both hands and a strange-col-
ored patch on her face. "Do you think it's 
fungus? Or bugs? What is- it?" she asked 
anxiously. ~ark :i:nd~Macia examined her

grabbed some packets of powdered citric 
and ascorbic acid &om the boxes lining the 
wall and explained that Martha couldn't 
use food products like vinegar and lemon 
juice to dissolve the crack because they 
contain bacteria; the powder is safer. Mark 
took Martha to the back of the van to talk 
to her more about her skin and how to 
make it better. 
I asked Maria why Martha's doctor 
hadn't helped her. "Honey, she didn't go to 
no doctor," Maria explained. "They never 
go to the doctor. They treat them like shit 
at the hospital." She and Dave told me ho•
