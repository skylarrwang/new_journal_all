W HEN SARA AVU!L TALKS ABOUT BOTSWANA, her voice is bur-
dened by bewilderment and helplessness. The Davenport junior 
spent last summer studying in the sub-Saharan African nation, 
which has a rate of HlV infection well above 30 percent-the high-
est in the world. But even as she rattles off death rates and recounts 
harrowing stories of her encounters with AIDS, she frequendy stops, 
frustrated with her inability to express or confront the magnitude of 
the problem. "People I knew would go to funerals every weekend," 
she remembers. "And even though they would never say that it was 
from AIDs--they always said it was tuberculosis or pneumonia or 
something-you just knew .... " 

After returning to Yale last fall, her sense of paralysis became a 
call to action. Avid scoured the undergraduate community for a 
venue for international AIDS activism with little success. Finally she 
contacted the Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDs--only 
to find out that there were "no plans to be involved in any advoca-
cy/activism work in Africa" and that the center's "involvement in 
Africa is minimal at the moment." Ic wasn't until she read a January 
2.8, 2001, article in The New l'Ork Times Magazine called "The 
World's AIDS Crisis is Solvable: Look at Brazil" that Avid realized 
there was a viable avenue for action so close to home. "There was 
one line in the article about Yale owning the patent to an important 
AIDS drug,,. she recalled. So she approached several professors to see 
if anyone knew anything about it, but again came up empty. 

And then the wave hit. 

On February 20, Avid received an e-mail from Marco Simons, 
a third-year Yale law student. The message was simple: Yale owned 
the patent for <4T, a critical and expensive antiretroviral medication 
which impedes the spread of HJV, and a group of srudents was orga· 
nwng tO put pressure on Yale to make the drug available at low-cost 
in South Africa. Simons had heard from a Harvard dassmate-
rutned·AIDS activist, Toby Kasper, who works for the international 
medical aid organization Doctors Without Borders (DWB) and was 
leading the charge to find a cheap source of <4T for South Africa. 
Kasper and his forces had already unsuccessfully appealed to 
Bristol-Myers Squibb, the Manhattan-based pharmaceutical giant 
to which Yale has exclusively licensed rhe production and sale of the 
drug. Now they were turning their attention to Yale itself. 

Simons ended his e-mail with one small request: "For the 
moment, this is not for media consumption." But less than a month 
later, the issue would be making headlines around the world, cui· 
minating on March 15 with a fulsomely congratulatory announce· 
ment by The New l'Ork Times, "Maker Yielding Patent in Africa for 
AIDS Drug."
