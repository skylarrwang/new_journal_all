In 1979, the predominantly white residents of East Shore, a New Haven neighborhood, launched a campaign to secede from the city, fearing the influx of minority families from a nearby housing project.  This effort, however, was short-lived, facing legal challenges and ultimately abandoned.


In the years since, the neighborhood has undergone significant demographic shifts. Property values have rebounded, and the economic downturn of the early 1990s is a distant memory.  East Shore now boasts 153 scattered-site homes, all occupied without incident. Former Fire Chief Martin O'Connor points to the area's achieved diversity, a contrast to its past. While the neighborhood is more diverse now, some long-time residents are moving to the suburbs seeking lower taxes and greater homogeneity.  This represents a subtle but significant shift, where the financial advantages of suburban life outweigh the social benefits of a diversified neighborhood.
