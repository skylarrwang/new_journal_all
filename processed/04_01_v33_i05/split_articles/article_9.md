fine and absolutely refuse to enter the hos-
pitals. "You just have to say, 'Honey, you 
goin' to the hospital.' Don't talk in no for-
mal English. You have to talk in street talk. 
If you talk in street talk, they listen. All 
those people at the hospital don't even 
know how to talk to these folks," she 
exclaimed. "And they are terrible at the 
hospital. They treat them so bad." 

But what if someone is really sick? 
What if someone has HIV or pneumonia or 
something that Maria's big heart and warm 
soup just can't ftx? "Sometimes I take them 
in," Maria explained. She told me about 
Cindy, who she had been close to, who had 
come to the van for clean needles every day. 
She was a "working girl," Maria explained. 
Maria noticed that she smelled terrible, so 
terrible that it fiUed up the whole van. "I 
knew it was coming from down there," she 
said. Maria took her in to the Bridgeport 
Hospital. The nurse was scared of her and 
the srneU. She wouldn't touch her at aU 
without gloves. "She treated her like a 
leper. She gave her a hospital gown holding 
it by two fingertips. She wouldn't talk to 
her. She would only talk to me. I said, 
'She-'s not contagious. You don't have to 
worry.' She said, 'I know what these people 
are like. I'm a professional.'" Cindy wanted 
to leave, but Maria stayed with her, felt her 
humiliation with her. Cindy turned out to 
have Hepatitis Band began receiving treat-
ment. "Sometimes you have to make them 
go in," Maria said. 

Maria glows because she loves so much 
and so well. She has bright purple nails and 
bright fuchsia lipstick, worn New Balance 
shoes, a gold tooth, and a necklace with a 
large, dangling crucifix. She shines. She 
cooks for the clients and hands out the vit-
amins and condoms and crack pipe screens 
with a gusto I could never have imagined. 
"You gotta have TLC," she explains cmphat-
icaUy. "If you don't have that tender loving 
care, you're never going to get anywhere 
with them."
