**Puzzled by American Culture?**
**Author: Sara Hirschhorn**
**Page number(s): 10-11**

"Puzzled by AMERICAN CULTURE? What is an American and do you wonder why they do the things they do? Space is limited, so hurry if you are interested," urged the e-mail that found its way to my inbox mid-February. Clearing the papers off my keyboard, I responded with as much American gusto as I could muster. A day later, with a welcome warmer than Mom's apple pie, I was cordially invited to participate as a "genuine American guest" in Yale's first US culture workshop. Great, I thought, an international petting zoo.


As I prepared for the panel, I considered how to present myself as an "authentic" American. Why did I ever agree to do this, I fretted in a high-pitched suburban Jewish white girl whine, pacing back and forth across my common room. Blasting "American Woman," I decided that I might as well look the part. I frantically rummaged through my closet, searching for the perfect outfit. Where were my miniskirts and pom-poms? Forget it, I thought, settling for my red, white, and blue pajamas. Already late, I grabbed a cup of coffee and set out on my way.


Following the pink signs through the labyrinthine basement of Rosenfeld Hall, I was greeted with open arms and an information packet by Elisabeth Mead, Assistant Director of the Office Of International Students and Scholars. Now here was a real American: blonde hair, blue eyes, and business casual. Mead, who left her job teaching ESL to start the program two years ago-following her first trip outside the United States at age 35-was eager to get under way. Nervously twirling her hair and chirping, ''I'm so American-what time is it? What time is it? When are we going to start?" as she passed out agendas, complained about tardiness, and wondered whether we should watch the movie first or eat pizza.


Akemi, a Japanese housewife married to a doctor at the Medical School, leaned towards me to talk. Shy but confident, she told me she had come to the United States two years ago but had just perfected her English. On my left, Christopher, a real minister, was chatting in a thick Southern accent with Yong "Tony" Zha-Ma, Elisabeth's assistant for the afternoon.


Clapping her hands to get our attention, Elisabeth introduced herself. To make everyone feel comfortable, she decided to share her experience visiting Italy and her "culture shock." "Here I was, coming from the nation of all nations, and I had no idea what to do. Can you imagine?" she asked.


Soon, it was time to introduce ourselves, because we were going to learn so much about ourselves and each other. Pointing a lacquered nail around the room, Elisabeth named them. In the corner was Heidi, a researcher from "where they make BMWs." Heidi smiled back thinly. Next, Professor Maira, a visiting scholar in psychology from Kazakhstan. Then, Raquel, a pharmacist from Spain whose husband was writing his dissertation. Across the room was Mukhtar, a Somalian graduate student in International Studies who had left his family in an Eritrean refugee camp to come to New Haven. I had hoped to hear more of their stories, but Elisabeth was getting anxious.


Soon, we were split up into groups. "Look, you four, you are the s-t-a-r group," she explained, pointing to a symbol on Tony's name tag. With majestic hand gestures and short sentences, Raquel, Tony, Maira, and myself were herded into the corner to tackle questions like "What is your idea of culture shock?" and "What is the American Dream?" "Just signal if you need me," she called over her shoulder, bounding over to help the others find their groups.


Exactly fifteen minutes later, Elisabeth interrupted and started the video, boasting that the "all-American pizza" was on its way. Praising us for the "simply wonderful" discussion, she reminded us that if we ever felt the need to talk, we should go to our friendly local therapist. "All Americans do," she assured. "I used to go every week!"


Then, she flipped on the video. Elisabeth would stop the tape every few minutes, reminding us that "culture was like an iceberg," our actions the result of deep, hidden values. "See," she explained, holding the packet up like a story-book, "sometimes [values] are under the water and we can't see what makes us act that way." But once we understand how Americans act, we can learn that it's "no problem" for us to "just all get along." We bonded over pizza and then said our good-byes.


Later, when I chatted with Elisabeth about the program, she spoke of the limitations of her fledgling enterprise, but was confident that she was helping people "resolve [their] cross-cultural issues." It was only the first workshop, after all. Even though not everyone "loves people and new experiences" or "operates on the basis of compassion, understanding, and open-mindedness" the way she, an American, does, we can all aspire to the ideal. Leaning back in her chair, she admitted that she "couldn't expect to change them into a mini-me." But it was only a matter of time.
