FIFTEEN HUNDRED years ago, Afghan artisans 
in Bamiyan began carving away at a 
mountainside with hammer and chisel. 
Last month, soldiers from the Taliban 
regime finished the job with explosives, 
destroying the two colossal Buddhas left by 
their predecessors. The world-especially 
the West-was dumbfounded at the 
Afghans' defiant act of desecration. Ever 
since 1793, when the French made the 
Louvre palace into the people's museum, 
art preservation has been a chief public 
project of Western democracies; to do the 
opposite is to proclaim one's own bar-
barism. This notion has never been lost on 
Americans, who, like skilled curators 
throughout history, have always used art to 
make the state look good. Museums tradi-
tionally divide their galleries by national 
school, and our own museums are no 
exception in shining the brightest spotlight 
on our native achievements. Therefore, the 
recent reopening of the remodeled 
American galleries at the Yale University 
Art Gallery, a point of Yale pride as the 
country's oldest college art museum, was, 
like many Yale events, an occasion for gra-
tuitous self-congratulation. This is the 
story of how we came to the top, and we're 
proud of it. 

For narrative effect, it's best to view 
the collection starting at the back, among 
the colonial and early national works of the 
Trumbull gallery. Most prominent is John 
Trumbull's history cycle depicting the 
Revolutionary War. The display marks our 
national inception, but one can't help but 
feel that, as a nation, we got a rather silly 
start. What we see is a secular apotheosis of 
George Washington. The general is at once 
a Christ figure, ascending to the heavens 
buoyed by the heroic cherubim under-
neath, and a cock-sure actor taking his final 
bows: He strides out of the gigantic central 
portrait while the war's supporting charac-
ters golf-clap appreciatively in the wings. 
But the theatricality of the project seems 
amateurish now-it's only myth, and sec-
ond-rate myth at that. Knowing what we 
know now of their slaves and their sexual 
peccadilloes, we can't help but feel an ado-
lescent awkwardness in the proto-national-
ist posturing of the Founding Fathers. 

Things just haven't turned out as they 
planned. 

For 
centuries, 
the 
name 
Agincourt was capable of rousing English 
pride; and the French still rally around the 
Bastille every July; but we are more likely to 
pinch our noses as we pass through 
Trenton, New Jersey, than to cross our 
hearts in memory of that glorious victory. 

The gallery captures Trumbull's time 
and its attitudes perfectly. Though we can 
today see past the spectacle, Trumbull and 
his peers were not disingenuous when they 
cast Trenton as the new Troy. A bust of 
Trumbull himself surveys the gallery, along 
with Thomas Crawford's busts of Homer, 
Demosthenes, and Cicero; their presence 
equates Trumbull's achievements with their 
own. 

Centrally 
located 
is 
Thomas 
Greenough's statue of The Angel Abdiel, 
seemingly advancing towards the New 
World. One almost hears echoes of 
Milton's praise following behind, applying 
equally to angel and revolutionary: Having 
fought the better fight, each now stand 
approved in sight of God, though worlds 
judged them perverse. The wall opposite 
Washington is occupied by portraits of the 
righteous (if misproportioned) worthies of 
Trumbull's time. Many of the works are 
Grand Tour portraits with the ruins of the 
Old World set as a backdrop, a powerful 
symbol of the American promise to rebuild 
the Western ideal from its current degener-
ate state. Even Ezra Stiles is here, standing 
before his bookcase in fuller possession of 
the Western tradition than any Oxford 
don. Taking it all in, the viewer is struck 
with wonder at the early nation's artistic 
project: We see here the artful but unmis-
takable extension of the young nation's 
middle finger, a gesture of contemptuous 
pride directed to the Old Country mon-
archs. One cannot help but nod in 
approval. 

As we pass into the colonial decorative 
arts galleries, the atmosphere is no longer 
that of a princely gallery, but your great-
great-grandfather's attic. The contrast bal-
ances our forefathers' idealized self-portrait 
with a snapshot of who they actually were. 
Most striking is the central display of colo-
nial chairs which matches Trumbull's histo-
ry cycle: Here we see the apotheosis of the 
joint-stool, circa 1715, artist unknown. The 
stool evokes far more pathos than 
Trumbull's grandstanding generals ever 
will, embodying the humble origins of 
America's rough-hewn, democratic genius. 

These two models remain consistent 
throughout the rest of the collection: The 
picture gallery is an aesthete's delight, while 
the peripheral decorative arts galleries pro-
vide a more sober sense of historical reso-
nance. Albert Bierstadt's painting of 
America's finest cathedral, Yosemite Valley, 
is expertly placed to capture our attention 
as we leave the furniture behind and seem-
ingly venture out of doors into the natural 
light of the grand salon, streaming through 
the newly uncovered skylights in the roof. 
Unfortunately, the curators have not taken 
full advantage of the spectacular views cre-
ated along the room's side corridors. Joseph 
Stella's Brooklyn Bridge, the 20th century's 
answer to Bierstadt's natural cathedral, 
should hang on the far wall behind it. 
Instead, it is on one of the shorter central 
walls; the connection is lost and the viewer 
is unable to stand back and take it all in. 
The corridor view presents us only with a 
decidedly un-epic piece by Edward 
Hopper, and the line of sight is broken by 
a group of statues by Thomas Eakins. 
Hiram Powers's rarified Greek Slave is simi-
larly 
crowded 
by 
display 
of 
Pennsylvania Dutch ironworks in the back-
ground, overflowing from the colonial dec-
orative arts galleries. Seen from the side, 
she is caged by the sandstone columns 
uncovered during the renovation, and this 
view would be enough to make Elizabeth 
Barrett Browning compose a second sonnet 
in her honor. By far the best-placed object 
is the gilded bronze American Eagle, 
perched on high and visible across the 
gallery from the entrance, a glorious 
reminder of the first battles that made this
