I, MY NAM£ IS DANIEL," a boy stutters softly as he walks up to 
the doorway, "and this is a seventh~grade math class. We've been 
working on solving equations and correcting our homework, and 
right now we're going over some work we did yesterday." He smiles, 
turns, and heads back to his desk. His classmates, all the while, 
work quietly, showing little interest in the speech. Daniel is a stu~ 
dent at Wintergreen lnterdistrict Magnet School in Hamden, 
Connecticut's first partnership with Edison Schools, Inc., a compa~ 
ny (headed by former Yale president Benno Schmidt) that manages 
public schools for profit. Daniel is also one of the school's 
"greeters," Edison~prescribed tour guides who inform visitors of the 
daily happenings. 

Since it opened in 1998, Wmtergreen has been welcoming vis~ 
itors of all kinds-researchers, politicians, prospective parents, and 
curious local residentS---every day, and the school has appeared 
glamorously in publications like Time and The New York Times. For 
Connecticut, Wintergreen is the first for~profit educational venture, 
serving K~8 students from Hamden, New Haven, Wallingford, and 
Woodbridge. For Edison, which typically commandeers failing 
public schools, Wintergreen is the first interdisuict school and one 
of the few schools with a majority of white, middle~class kids. "We 
have a very, very diverse learning population here," Dale 
Becnardoni, the school's principal, told me. "We don't have a pop~ 
ulation that's 98 percent minority or 80 percent free~ or reduced~ 
lunch." 

In the mid~nineries, a vacant school on Wmtergreen Avenue 
came to the attention of the Hamden school board as they faced 
overcrowding. Realizing that the state would pay for renovations if 
the school became an interdisuict magnet, the board secured the 
participation of three area school districts. With that, "WIMS," as 
Wmtergreen is affectionately known, was born. None of the four 
districts sending students wanted to manage the school or supply 
the curriculum, so they looked elsewhere. They decided that the 
nitty~gritty details, like employment and maintenance, would fall to 
Area Cooperative Education Services (ACES), a subdivision of the 
State Depanment of Education which operates magnet schools and

arts and special education programs in southern Connecticut. 
Curriculum, technology, and teacher training would come from 
Edison. "We're a public school in every way," Bernardoni told me, 
"except that we follow an Edison design and we're managed by 
ACES. So we follow all of the standards that are part of being a pub~ 
lie school, such as teacher certification, using the Connecticut 
Mastery Tests as a tool for assessment, and getting our funding from 
local and state taxes." A steering committee, composed of superin~ 
tendents and school board members from the sending districts, 
ACES representatives, and Edison representatives, oversees the whole 
process. "This is a very complex school," Bernardoni admitted. 

Over the years, educators, politicians, and community leaders 
in New Haven have been joining the growing ranks of 
Wintergreen's interested observers. In recent months, more and 
more of them have been expressing a desire to bring Edison into 
New Haven's public schools. This is true even though for weeks, the 
media have been trumpeting Edison's scandalously failed bid to 
manage five New York City schools and allegations that the com~ 
pany kicked out under~performing and minority students at its San 
Francisco school. And the latest Edison Schools Annual Report 
described Wmtergreen's trends in state test scores as "strongly nega~ • 
rive"- in fact, the school received the worst performance rating of • 
any Edison school in the nation. The percentage of fourth graders 
at the school who met the state goal for reading in 1999 had fallen 
from 56 percent, the state average, to 50 percent.

the Heartwood Institute. Edison schools 
are divided into "academies"-which corre-
spond, more or less, ro elementary school, 
middle school, and high school-but the 
programs of study are similarly conceived 
for each one: Edison devises a curriculum 
·on the corporate level that schools are 
obliged co follow. 

On a visit co Wintergreen, I sat in on 
a first and second grade reading class. Every 
morning, from 8:30 co 10:00, students in 
kindergarten through fifth divide into 
Success for All reading classes. As Edison's 
website expounds, "The whole school is 
reading! The next 90 minutes are the most 
precious of the Edison day. Families are 
urged not to make appointments for stu-
dents during the reading block, and teach-
ers are given release time only for emergen-
cies. The whole school is focused on build-
ing reading skills with the Success for All 
program." 

Instead of grouping students by grade 
level, Success for All uses "tracking." 
Students are tested and placed into classes 
according to scores. The class I visited was 
made up of high-performing first graders, 
average second graders, and low-perform-
ing third graders. At the beginning of the 
period, students were sitting in small 
groups. The teacher had written the words 
"plenty," 
"coyotes," 
"whispered," 
"molasses," and "sight" on the board and 
had asked the class to write five sentences 
using those words. Like most features of 
the Edison curriculum, this activity has a 
special name: Meaningful Sentences. 

Though some students seemed to be hard 
at work, others were obviously not on task. 
When I asked one nine-year-old what he 
was writing about, he replied tersely, "I 
don't know." Other students I asked-
younger ones who sat together mutely-
did not even reply to my question. The 
teacher, all the while, sat at her desk in 
silence. 

By nine o'clock, the class had moved 
onto a new activity called Adventures in 
Writing, a prompt-based writing exercise 
related to a story the class has been reading. 
"What are five things that you would bring 
with you .if.you had co move?" the teacher 
asked the class. "I want you to think first, 
and then to list them." She repeated "five 
things" over and over again and then asked 
the students what important piece of infor-
mation they need to tack on to the end of 
their lists. None of the kids figured it out, 
and the teacher finally told them: "I want 
you to write 'These things are important 
because .... "' This mech'od of teaching, 
which is an integral part of the Edison 
design, also has a special name: Direction 
Instruction. Edison describes Direction 
Instruction as "explicit teaching combined 
with skilled questioning and observing to 
assess student understanding." Or, as Jack 
Gillette, head of the Yale Teacher 
Preparation 
Program, 
exaggerated, 
"Chanting-Ah-Eh-EEh-Oh-Ou." 

While students immersed themselves 
in Adventures in Writing, the teacher told 
me that behavior had been a problem late-
ly. "Some of the kids are new this week," 
she said, "and they're getting used to my 
expectationS:" Success for All allows kids 
who score high enough on periodic assess-
ments to move up into higher-level reading 
classes during the year, and chi~ class had 
just received a fresh batch of advancing stu-
dents. She does not think, though, that the 
mixture of ages in her class is bad for the 
kids socially. "It usually ends up balancing 
out. It definitely works." 

Success for All runs on a rigid five-day 
schedule that cycles throughout the year. 
On day one, the teacher introduces vocab-
ulary and a story. On day two, the class fin-
ishes the story and participates in vocabu-
lary building activities. Days three and four 
focus mosdy on Meaningful Sentences and 
Adventures in Writing, and on day five the 
class reviews the weekly story and cakes a 
short test. Each activity has a specific time 
limit and structure, described thoroughly 
in the Success for All handbook, and teach-

Success for All and Edison rep-
resentatives come around every 
so often with checklists in hand 
to make sure everything is in 
order. 

Despite Success for All's 
unyielding 
structure, 
the 
teacher I talked to said she feels 
like she does have freedom "to 
go out of the box and use cre-
ativity'" at rimes. When I asked 
her in what ways, she was 
~ 
unclear. "We can do special projects now 
and then," she said. But she also said she 
thinks Success for All works very well. "It 
kind of does what it says--success for all." 

In terms of improving test scores, however, 
Success for All has a mixed record. It has 
worked effectively in certain schools, but 
not in others. Gillette said that it works 
well with teachers who have no experience. 
.. You just get told exactly what you're doing 
each day. That's why it can take some of the 
lowest reading scores and move them up to 
the next-to-lowest- which is not unim-
pressive. But it can't move them oftentimes 
from the next-to-lowest to the middle." 

The students in the class I was observ-
ing continued working on Adventures in 
Writing uncil the end of the period. Most 
seemed anxious to leave by then; an hour 
and half of reading is an awful lot to 
demand of an eight-year-old. As the stu-
dents filed out of the room to return to 
their "home bases," the hallways began to 
611 up. Two teachers who passed by me 
were discussing the very same Success for 
activities I had just witnessed. 

too. Every Wintergreen family with a child 
in third grade or higher receives a home 
computer, and reachers receive their own 
laptops. Edison has an intranet system 
called "The Common," over which stu-
dents, teachers, and parents can virtually 
interact. Bernardoni, however, admitted 
that only 80 to 85 percent of families fully 
use the system, because of network over-
crowding. Edison also provides its teachers 
and adminisuators with ongoing training 
in order to help them teach the Edison cur-
riculum. The company provides teachers 
with transportation to Edison camps dur-
ing the summer and to Edison conferences 
during the school year. Edison representa-
tives also visit schools regularly. 

But as districts across the nation 
increasingly jump on the Edison bandwag-
on, Edison's promises of educational 
improvement have yet to be realized. The 
American Federation ofTeachers (AFT) and 
Western Michigan University recently 
released separate srudies claiming that 
Edison schools have not been as beneficial 
as promised. "When it comes to measuring 
presentations and promotional 
materials." 

Edison, of course, dis-
agrees. Its website features Ten 
Fundamentals of its "innovative 
schools" promising "dramatic 
results." Using bUJ..zwords like 
"purpose," "leadership," "expec-
tations," "teamwork," "account-
ability," and "community," the 
company paints itself as radical-
ly experimental. Fundamental 
number one reads, "Edison's 
organizational model is based 
on principles that have been 
shown 
to 
ensure 
effective 
schools." Number four, "Edison is commit-
ted to vital and diverse instructional strate-
gies that encourage innovation and excite-
ment." And number seven, "Parcnership 
schools are technologically rich environ-
ments that prepare students for the work-
places of tomorrow." Edison even has a 
study of its own posted on the website: 
"NEA-Columbia University Study Finds 
Edison Schools a Promising Model for 
Teachers." 

But nothing at Wintergreen seemed 
particularly innovative. Teachers follow 
packaged programs like Success for All 
almost blindly. Gillette thinks chat even if 
Edison's profit motive were in some way 
tolerable, the design and curriculum char 
Edison provides are not worth it. "Their 
design is not even a particularly unique 
design," he said. "Their design is not inno-
vative, their structure is not innovative." 

Ultimately, Edison seems to subscribe ro 
the view of Steve Wilson, the founder of 
Advantage Schools, another private opera-
tor of public schools. Wuson told Th~ Nro• 
l'Orkn- last October, "Teachers have lx'Cn
