A NNE BoGART WANTS ro BE DEAN oF THE YALE ScHOOL OF DRAMA. 
After a day packed with a Master's Lunch, a Master's Tea, and a lecture and 
dinner sponsored by the Dramat, she seems too tired to hide her desire for 
the position. "This is the only position I would consider any place in the 
United States. There's no. other institution I )VOuld have been interested in," 
she reveals. She sips her coffee and, sighlng, admits to the feelings that arose 
as she walked past the University Theatre and the Yale Repertory Theatre to 
the coffee shop. ''I'm disappointed that the searchers were not more adven-
turous." 

Bogart is not some forlorn dreamer who has set her sights too high. She is 
the artistic director of New York's Saratoga International Theatre Institute (szn) 
and an associate professor of directing at Columbia University. She directed her 
first play, Eugene Ionesco's The Bald Soprano, at the age of fifteen. Her method 
.of theatrical training, known as Viewpoints, is extremely influential in the the-
ater world. She has received two Obies and a Guggenheim Fellowship, among 
other awards. Robert wildman, managing director of The Connecticut 
Repertory Theatre and former marketing director of the Drama School and 
the Yale Rep.calls her "a brilliant theater artist." And she was a candidate 
ten years ago when the last search for a Drama School dean took place. 

But Bogart has not been offered the position. While her ideas 
about theater and the changes necessary within the Drama 
School's programs set her apart from many of the other candi-
dates, a much more striking difference has become apparent 
in the last three months-unlike Bogart, most of the other 
theater luminaries recommended by the search committee to 
President Richard Levin don't actually want the job. Two, 
Oskar Eustis and Jon Jory, have already turned it down; two 
others, Mark Lamos and JoAnne Akalaitis, withdrew themselves 
from the short list because they weren't interested. The outgoing dean 
has been forced to plan a theater season of which he may not be a part, and 
he may need to remain at Yale for an extra year as the University scrambles to 
find a replacement. Because of a decline in the Rep's popularity and a drop in the Drama 
School's reputation, the search is much more difficult than it has ever been. While a for-
ward-thinlcing artist like Bogart might be just what the Drama School needs, financial con-
cerns make such a daring choice uncomfortable. At the same time, many of those who 
could help the institution regain its standing are reluctant to come to New Haven. 


O
n April25, 2000, after two five-year terms, Stan Wojewodslci Jr. announced that he 
would be stepping down from his position as dean of the Yale School of Drama and artis-
tic director of the Yale Repertory Theatre at the end of the school year. President Levin 
quickly appointed an eight-person search committee charged with interviewing candi-
dates and submitting a list of recommendations. "It was dear to me from the beginning 
that the intent was to try to have someone here by the end of the calendar year," explains 
committee member Gary Haller, a professor of chemical engineering and master of 
Jonathan Edwards College. If a new dean were not hired by January 2001, many wor-
ried that the planning of the Rep's 2001-2002 season would be delayed. The commit-
tee worked through the summer, contacting potential candidates and reporting back 
to other committee members. "Nobody could accuse us of not hearing from 
everybody," says Haller. "The amount of input was Larger than it has been 
on any other dean search committee I've been on. We tried to hear from 
all components of the academic drama and the professional drama 
communities." Still, the search tearh did have its own idea of 
what they were loolcing for: "The hope was that we could fmd 
some person who had professional achievement as a direc-
tor, a playwright, choreographer, or something like 
that, and had had some academic interaction as well," 
says Haller. "Not only should the person actually work 
professionally but they should also have a sense of man-
agement so that they can manage not only the repertory 
theater part of it but also the academic programs." Although 
some committee members were unsure of Bogart's managemenr skills, she 
made the short List. 


THROUGHOUT THE FALL, the potential 
deans carne to New Haven for interviews. 
Two of the top candidates, Akalaitis of 
Bard College and Lamos, formerly of the 
Hartford Stage, quickly bowed out. Both 
apparendy decided that they didn't want to 
become academic administrators. "I'm not 
sure I want to be the dean of anything, 
although I think the Yale School of Drama 
is very important and it is essential that 
they find a wonderful person," explains 
Akalaitis. 

In both her interviews, in September 
and November, Bogart articulated a vision 
for the Drama School and the Rep that 
involved huge changes. "I said that I didn't 
think that the Rep should be a regional the-
ater anymore, but that it should be an 
international theater," Bogart recalls. 

"I wanted to radically change the kind of 
training for actors and directors. The train-; 
ing would be influenced from ocher cul-
tures throughout the world. Actors would 
not necessarily be trained for the regional 
theater, bur would train, in a way, to be 
'poets of the theater' with physical and 
vocal virtuosity and rigor." 

In December, the committee met with 
Levin. According to Haller, "essentially the 
work of the whole committee was con-
veyed to the president." The final decision 
was left to Levin himselÂ£ According co 
sources, the top choices were Oskar Eustis, 
artistic director of Triniry Repertory 
Company of Providence and former head 
of the Eureka Theatre Company in San 
Francisco, and Jon Jory, former artistic 
director of the Actors Theatre of Louisville 
and a founder of New Haven's own Long 
WharfThearre. Bogart was apparendy roo 
radical for the staid Drama School: .. [Their 
choice was] essentially an articulation of a 
very different concept of theater," Bogart 
says. "It became dear that I was not what 
they were looking for." Phone calls between 
New 
Haven 
and 
Providence 
commenced-Eustis was the first choice for 
the position. On December 21, the 
Hartford Courant ran the headline "Trinity 
Rep Director Likely Yale Successor." The 
short article included only the unsourced 
assertion of the likelihood of Eustis's selec-
tion as dean and a summary of his career. 

T he leak of Eustis's name would make the 
replacement process infinitely more diffi-
cult. 

LE SEARCH quickly became as much a 
matter for the press as for President Levin. 
The Courant continued to cover the story, 
while the Providmce Journal took up the 
question even more intensely. On January 
13, it confirmed that the job had been 
offered to Eustis, posing the question "Will 
Oskar Leave?" to its readers, and fretting 
that "being head of a top company such as 
Trinity is an important post, but Chief at 
Yale? That is a world-class position." 

This commotion surrounding the cur-
rent process contrasts sharply with the 1990 
search that resulted in Wojewodski's 
appointment. In that search, newspaper 
stories included all the names being thrown 
around and suggested that the 
process was moving forward too slowly, 
but the selection of Wojewodski was kept 
under wraps until officially revealed by 
Wojewodski ~d the University. According 
to Wildman, who had to handle the 
University's announcement of the hiring, "I 
was only cold a week before the announce-
ment . . . The process was almost entirely 
leak-free." Bogart, a candidate at the rime, 
confirms this. "That was done very effec-
tively, particularly as it was announced. I 
don't think there was much buzz at all 
beforehand." 

In 2000, press leaks changed the 
dynamics of the situation entirely. Now, 
Yale was at a disadvantage-any potential 
candidates knew that they were not Yale's 
first choice, information that was bruising 
to theater-sized egos. According to Haller, 
"It's turned into such a public search that 
now everybody's gun-shy. I'm convinced 
that the reason we lost one of our candi-
dates had to be one of the publications." 

While Haller, as a member of the search 
committee, is not allowed to comment on 
specific candidates, sources speculate char 
Jon Jory, the second choice for the dean-
ship, turned the position down because he 
discovered that Eustis was the first choice. 

Both the city of Providence and Eustis 
himself used the increased media attention 
to their advantage. For Providence, the cov-
erage helped keep Eustis in town. "One 
thing is for sure," the Journal wrote. 
"If Eustis leaves, it would have a major 
impact on Rhode Island's arts scene. Not 
only has his regime seen Trinity go from 
oceans of red ink to black, it has seen a revi-
talizing of the mission of the old theater .. . 
Eustis has had a remarkable reign here. He 
has matched up with this community bet-
ter than any other artistic leader I've seen in 
25 years covering the arts. He has placed 
Rhode Island back on the map and it will 
be a shame if he moves on." The paper's
