Cracki rig the Whip 
by Clint Carroll 
What happens when you r senior 
essay is still due five years later 
T 
he senior essay is supposedly a graduation requirement-and 
to be literal, it is. But it's not due in April. While the rest of 
the graduating class scrambles to meet the deadline, a wily few just 
take it easy. They know the truth: They have up to five years after 
graduation to finish their projects. 

I had heard of people doing this, delinquents who had left Yale 
with a toy diploma and a stern warning: Five years or else! These 
were the legends, the mythic heroes of every kid who had ever called 
home in tears, lamenting work, deadlines, and the future. But were 
they really out there? That's when my obsession began. 

The first delinquent I cornered was Susan (names have been 
changed), a young professional living in California. She had left 
Yale in 1999 without a diploma and with just enough dignity to 
make it out West. For her, the senior essay had been of secondary 
importance, an afterthought in her world of activism, "event orga-
nizing," and liberalism. She was willing to tell me everything, even 
though she had been bedridden for days with a cold. 

She claimed that she hadn't needed a degree to get a job. "I 
think I got my job because of the skills I learned in extracurricular 
pursuits ... and not because of my academic experiences at Yale." I 
never found out exactly what she did. I just couldn't press her. She 
was my first contact, a Â·confirmed invalid, and a charming woman. 
But I could sense a blackness in her story. I proceeded with caution. 

The senior essay had indeed affected her adult life. And though 
she was all laughs and nonchalance when it came to talking about 
this, I could sense a desperation in her words: "Ir makes me stay 
horne on Saturday nights . . . and plunge into isolated depression, 
staring at the wall, picking my ear." I could see Susan in a hospice 
gown, slobbering over some coloring book, writing that damn essay. 
My heart almost went out to her. 

But her anxiety seemed to be self-imposed. She told me that 
Yale never contacted her, that she didn't have an advisor, and that 
she could graduate at her own leisure. She was planning on getting 
her diploma this year, so that a younger friend, in the class of 'ox, 
wouldn't be able to "rub it in." She had even made a big foam board 
for her door, a schedule to help her manage time. Her cat had 
devoured it in a frighteningly symbolic act, leaving her with noth-
ing but an essay due and a ticking clock. 

Susan wasn't the only one I found. I had heard that another like 
her lived in New Haven. They called him "Seven Year Pete" and he 
was rumored to be the "oldest undergraduate ever." I was told that 
I could find him at a local coffee shop, that he never left the place. 
But, naturally, he wasn't there. His friends, a roguish group of three, 
told me that Pete had moved to Virginia and that he couldn't be 
reached. He had too many boys in New Haven; it was impossible 
for him to concentrate on work when he was here. 

They continued to 
talk about Pete for some 
time, growing less and less cool as 
they did so. Their stories began to sound 
conspiratorial. Yale was supposedly threaten-
ing to hold Pete's diploma indefinitely, and he had 
needed to "get away" until something blew over. He 
was holed up down South, Yale was upset, and here I 
was, sipping coffee with three strangers with as many cigarettes 
and a whole lot of tattoos. 

I never did talk co Pete. Yet I couldn't help but feel sorry for 
him. Susan had found happy anonymity in California. He was a 
known fugitive. She was working on her essay at leisure. He was fin-
ishing his under a looming deadline. She was bedridden in the sun. 
And he was hiding from Big Brother. It just didn't seem fair. 

So I went looking. for help. I figured that Susan was fine, but 
was worried about Pete. I wanted to fmd him someone--a mentor 
who could inspire him and coax him out of hiding. I found one, 
and she c~aimed to be good. She was a ~ominatrix who dismissed 
all procrastin;lting students as "naughty, naughty" people. Her oper-
ation, "Fit-to-be-Tied,~ seemed legitimate. So I contacted her. Her 
name was Mistress Mineko, and she was the real thing. 

I explained that I was looking for students who could not pos-
sibly finish their essays on time. I asked whether the Mistress could 
help these stragglers, and she said that she could. "I actually charge 
a reduced rate for writers of overdue papers. In our experience, the 
more desperate the client, the easier he or she is to break," she elab-
orated. I didn't really know what she was talking about. 

She sounded like a real hard-nose. She was clearly a sadist, but 
had a girlish sweetness. She told me, "[I'll do] whatever it takes to 
get results, fast. All some clients require is a good talking to ... 
Other clients require more severe measures. This is why we require 
our agents to bring one of our standard 'thesis toolboxes"' -I could 
only guess what these boxes contained, envisioning some duct tape, 
gags, maybe a low-voltage prod-"which include duct tape, gags, 
low-voltage prods." 

I wasn't sure whether bizarre sex would solve any of Pete's prob-
lems, but the Mistress was onto something. Students like Pete just 
need to be pushed sometimes. Often all it takes is an authority fig-
ure stepping in-a teacher, a parent, an older sibling, a sadist. I 
knew that I would never be a figure of eminence to Pete. But maybe 
the Mistress could be. She was so kind, so motherly, so obnoxious-
ly raw. She was all a procrastinating student really needed-a smile, 
a hug, and a stinging slap on the ass.
