socialized in schools of education and 
taught to apply their own creativity to a 
problem. That's nice up to a point, but the 
idea that we should have tens of thousands 
of teachers all around the country trying to 
stumble upon the best way to teach reading 
to a first grader is lcind of psychotic, right?" 
Edison, named for the man who experi-
mented with over six thousand filaments in 
his laboratory in order to invent the light 
bulb, ironically takes the power to experi-


ment away from teachers in the classroom. 
What is so ingenious about Edison, 
though, is that it has the capital to make 
itself look innovative, even when it is not. 
"Edison has exaggerated test score gains 
and emphasized favorable comparisons in 
order to show Edison schools in the most 
positive light," reads the AFT report. "In 
fact, if public schools were to usc some of 
Edison's evaluation methods and modes of 
presenting data, they would look a lot bet-
ter, too." Since 1995, Edison has invested 
over $150 million in its II3 schools across 
the nation, supplying them not only with 
neatly packaged school designs, but with a 
built-in public relations machine as well. 
It's what Edison says that matters, not what 
it actually does. "The big issue is they give 
everyone a laptop," said Gillette. "But even 
when they say they give everyone a laptop, 
they don't actually tic it to any pedagogical 
intervention. It's as if that statement alone 
had educational value. You scratch the sur-
face and there's nothing. It plays upon peo-
ple's assumptions about status, and that's 
been their marketing tool." In Edison's 
annual "customer satisfaction" surveys, 90 
percent of parents rate the company A orB, 
while 75 percent of teachers rate the com-
pany B or c. Edison also has a teacher 
turnover rate of twenty-four percent-
almost double the national average. 

AT U.ST FBFEBRUARY'S State of the City 
Address, 
New 
Haven 
mayor John 
DeStefano announced for the first time his 
interest in turning some of the city's 
schools over to Edison. "I would like to see 
an Edison School in New Haven," he told 
the Nnu Havm Registn-. "I think it would 
introduce choice and competition." 

But Edison had been the topic of 
backroom conversations in New Haven 
since Wintergreen opened in 1998, when

Regjnald Mayo told The New York Times, 
"This is a chance to take a look at Edison. 
I have played with it and toyed with it. We 
may involve some of our own schools." 
Mayo, in fact, had been talking informally 
with Edison representatives several years 
before about his desire to bring the corpo-
ration into New Have(\. And for Benno 
Schmidt, chairman of Edison, the feeling is 
mutual-he "would be delighted" to sign 1 
contract with New Haven. 

In the midst of an increasingly brutal 
reelection campaign, DeStefano has been 
talking about Edison more frequently. "As 
part of the choice proposal, we wanted to 
explore not just choice curriculum, but 
choice in management models," he said. 
"The issue of Edison Schools has been 
floating around New Haven for a long 
time, and we thought we might consider an 
Edison School or two." DeStefano says that 
Edison can spark competition in ways that 
other schools cannot. "I think that compe-
tition is a good thing," he said, "and I think 
the difference in management styles creates 
a dynamic that makes everybody look at 
what they're doing." Then he added, with a 
wink, "I know that when I'm in an elec-
tion-you know, where I'm running 
against somebody-it makes me focus a lit-
de bit harder." 

But given Wintergreen's record and 
the ongoing national controversy sur-
rounding Edison, the mayor's move is sur-
prising. Gillette cannot understand why 
the mayor even considered Edison. "From 
a rational, analytic perspective it doesn't 
make sense," he said. "From a political per-
spective it must be because there's some sta-
tus attached to a for-profit, or there's some 
other political advantage to being allied 
with [Edison)." But, for both Edison and 
DeStefano, success is more about good PR 
than actual results. And if they can con-
vince everyone that they're on the right 
track, what's behind the sales pitch just 
might not matter.
