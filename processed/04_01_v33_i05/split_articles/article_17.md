ing and delays the onset of AIOS, thereby allowing patients tO sur-
vive for decades after contracting the virus. Though it was first syn-
thesized in a cancer study at the University of Michigan in the 
1960s, interest in <4T was not renewed until the global aids epi-
demic flared up in the 1980s. In 1986, two Yale doctors, William 
Prusoff and Tai-shun Lin, received several million dollars of fund-
ing from the National Institutes of Health and other sources-
Bristol-Myers among them-to investigate whether the compound 
could be used in combating HIV. When experiments in Yale phar-
macology labs proved successful, the University quickly patented 
the compound and sought out a pharmaceutical company to take 
care of the development, marketing, and distribution of the drug. 
Bristol-Myers had "right of first refusal" because of its help funding 
the project, and, naturally, the company jumped at the opportuni-
ty. 

In 1994, <4T hit the shelves under the brand name Zerit. us 
newspapers praised the low cost of the new drug, which would be 
offered at s6 a day. But this still meant that a year's supply of Zerit 
would cost almost $2000, more than the per capita income of 
almost every African nation. 

The high price of AIDS drugs in the developing world has elicit-
ed considerable international attention-and frequent outrage-in 
the past two years. Emotionally charged articles in publications 
from Th~ &oTWmist to Mothn-jones have highlighted the difficulties 
of treating AIDS in poor countries. International NGOs have called

Global AIDS

Vale to prick the 
corporate 
conscience 
on the developed world to help provide treatment for HIV-positive 
patients who can't afford the S15,ooo-a-year drug regimen required 
to slow the spread of the virus and the onset of AIDS. The ATOS 
activism group ACT-UP headed a widely publicized campaign of civil 
disobedience at every one of Al Gore's presidential campaign stops 
until he agreed that-contrary to previous statements in which he 
had toed the pharmaceutical company line-there is an urgent need 
for low-cost AIDS drugs in Africa. And, most forebodingly for phar-
maceutical companies, Brazil and India were often pointed to as 
models of how the developing world could deal with the crisis: by 
ignoring patents and allowing cheap generic production of medica-
nons. 

South Africa has been a focal point in the struggle for afford-
able AIDS medication. Not only does it have more cases of HIV than 
any other country, but, unlike most of sub-Saharan Africa, it has 
both a strong patent protection system and sufficient domestic 
infrastructure to develop its own pharmaceutical manufacturing if 
patents allow it-making South Africa a battlefront for corpora-
tions and NGOs. Toby Kasper coordinates ows's "Access to Essential 
Medicines Campaign" in South Africa and has emerged as the 
spokesman and de facto leader of the mix of activists, officials, and 
AIDS patients fighting for drug availability. Last fall, Kasper picked 
out Bristol-Myers as a cargeL He sought to convince the company

quixotic. "Drug companies have always 
tried to protect their patents to the bone," 
he acknowledged. The company's profits 
on the drug exceed s6oo million annually, 
and there had never before been a case 
where a pharmaceutical company had 
given up such a lucrative drug in a protect-
ed market like South Africa. In fact, 
Bristol-Myers is one of 39 international 
drug-makers currently suing the South 
African government for more stringenr 
years, she has worked for an international 
AIDS consortium in England and did 
research for a "60 Minutes" documentary 
on AIDS in Africa, which sent her to a con-
ference in Durbin, South Africa, last sum-
mer. There, she learned about her future 
school's ownership of the <4T patent 
and met Toby Kasper. When Kasper and 
DWB-which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 
1999-set their sights on Yale in January, 
Kapczyski and Simons were the first people 
contacted. 

Kapczynski, who was described by a 
colleague as having "a radical inside 
combined with a very rational 
sense of how to get things 
done," recognized a unique 
opportunity with fur-reach-
ing implications. "Up to now," she 
said, "it's been activists fighting on the 
ground and big corporations making con-
cessions." But in this case, the object of 
pressure was a university rather than a cor-
poration, and for Kapczynski, Kasper, and 
their small squadron of activists, this was 
an essential difference. "Universities ace a 
gt>od point of leverage," Kapczynski 
remarked. "They are an important pressure 
point, in part because they have student 
bodies that care about these things." And, 
patent 
protection-
despite the fucr that sales 
of <4T in the country ace 
virtually nil. 

But <4T was a special 
case: A university, not a 
corporation, 
had 
the 
patent. After a stream of 
letters from DWB begin-
ning 
last 
November, 
Yale and 
Bristol-Myers 
had emerged 
from the fray 
with no sign of 
Injury. 

as Kasper did not hesitate 
to point out to Yale, the 
University has a stated 
objective in patents and 
licensing to "pursue the 
benefit of society in 
general." 

So, the cam-
paign was initially kept 
quiet and private, reflecting 
Simons's belief that "with 
Bristol-Myers passed the 
buck to Yale, which itself profits some $40 
million a year from the drug. So Kasper 
called up his friends in New Haven, sent a 
letter to the University, and set out to per-
suade, pressure, or shame Yale into giving 
up the rights to <4T in South .Aft:ica. 

LIKE AVIEL, Amy Kapczynski, a first-
year law student, hadn't done much in the 
way of AIDS activism at Yale before the 
movement for patent relief shifted its focus 
towards the University. But in the past few 
20 
University politics things tend to get done 
better behind closed doors than in the 
midst of big public campaigns." Instead of 
approaching Yale as they would a corpora-
cion, the coalition treated it as a potencial 
associate. 

"No 
one 
considered 
University an adversary, but really more of 
a cautious partner," Aviel said. "And it was 
our job to capitalize on this partnership." 

In February of this year, all currents of 
the movement were coming together, and 
the point of their convergence was Yale. 
DWB had focused its private and public 
efforts on the University; the issue of 
patents and AIDS drugs was making the 
national editorial pages; and a small but 
informed coalition of students began 
pleading the case to administrators, build-
ing an alliance with aid workers and 
patients who rely on <4T, and directing 
international momenrum into key chan-
nels. "I don't think we can take credit for 
making this happen," said Avid. "It was 
definitely globaJ momentum that we 
directed a little closer to home. We rode the 
wave of activists around the world."

ON 
FEBRUARY 14, DWB wrote a letter 
to Jon Soderstrom, the Managing 
Director of 
Office 
for 
Cooperative Research (OCR), which 
oversees patenting and licensing for 
University studies. The letter called for Yale 
to issue DWB a "voluntary license" so that it 
could obtain generic drugs for distribution 
in South Africa. That day, Kasper 
sent another letter to Bristol-
Myers asking the company to sup-
port this request. The Yale students 
also 
wrote 
to 
University 
officials 
and issued a request, 
which was denied, for 
a copy of the Bristol-
Myers licensing agree-
ment. Meanwhile, they were gearing up to 
intensify pressure on Soderstrom, whom 
they expected would not initially grant 
Kasper's request. 

The effort received a boost 
when Cipla, an Indian pharma-
ceutical firm, announced that it 
would produce a generic version of 
d4T and sell it at a remarkable 1.5 percent 
of the cost of Zerit. Thus, when Yale did 
respond to DWB on February 28--claiming, 
according to Kasper, "chat they couldn't do 
anything" because of their exclusive license 
with Brisrol-Myers-che issue was no 
longer quiet. The day before, Kasper and 
other representatives of DWB had visited 
Yale, issuing a public challenge to the 
University for the first time. 

From this point until the March 14 
announcement by Bristol-Myers, exacdy 
what transpired between the University

and the pharmaceutical company is con-
fined to speculation. Kapczynski called the 
negotiations "a murky procession 
of events." The public request by 
OWB elicited a tentative endorse-
ment from Or. Prusoff, who still 
does pharmacology research at 
Yale. "This was not something 
I've worried 
about before," 
Prusoff admitted. "But the prob-
lem was clearly presented." On 
March 9, DWB sent a second letter 
to Soderstrom. T he message, 
according to Kasper, was simple: 
"If you are following your own 
licensing policy, you should do 
something about <4T prices in 
South Africa." In an appeal to the 
ocR's profit-making focus, the 
letter also pointed out that Yale 
national event raised the bar for Bristol-
Myers and Yale: The drug manufacturer 
had almost nothing to lose fman-
Amy Kapczynskl 
cially in granting a voluntary 
license for d4T. 

T he issue had also been picked up by 
GESO, Yale's incipient graduate student 
union, after Fran Balamuth, an MDIPHD 
student in immunobiology, brought the 
issue to the attention of the coordinating 
committee. For her, the controversy was 
about researchers' rights. "D4T is intimate-
_ly connected with what [GESO is] fighting 
for," she maintained. "For a long time, 
GESo's been talking about the role of cor-
porations in determining research and 
where it goes." The union created a peti-
tion calling for the release of the c4T 
patent in South Africa and mobilized its 
sprawling grassroots network. Within a 
matter of days, Balamuth and others had 
collected over 6oo signatures-including 
one from Prusoff, the drug's inventor. 

However, contrary to the accounts of GESO 
activists, Soderstrom claims he never actu-
ally saw the petition until after the 
decision was made. 

As both the public and private 
campaigns 
continued, Soderstrom 
remained quiet. For the students and DWB, 
this seemed a sign of dubious activity on 
the part of Yale and Bristol-Myers. 
Kapczynsk.i and Simons were prepared co 
escalate public pressure when the student 
body returned to campus after spring 
break. At this point, another inter-
APRIL 20, 2001 
Merck announced that it would sell its 
AIDS drugs at cost in South Africa. This 
was unknown territory for the industry, 
but once it had made the step, it could 
only move forward. 

Public pressure reached a critical 
point on March 12 when Th~ N~ l'Ork 
Times printed an article on Yale's unwill-
ingness to relax the <4T patent in South 
Africa. Even Prusoff, who remains one of 
Yale's most reliable supporters on this issue 
and who shares in the pharmaceutical 
company's profits from c4T, points to the 
public relations nightmare conjured up by 
the article. "The most important thing was 
when Th~ Nnu York Tim~s picked up that 
article and brought that forward," he spec-
ulated. "I think that was a major factor in 
stimulating discussion between the Yale 
administrators and Bristol-Myers." 

Kasper 
agrees 
with 
this 
appraisal. "There was the 
article, and voila, things 
worked out. I don't 
think it was just coinci-
dence."' 

Soderstrom, however, 
maintains that these external fac-
tors had little persuasive effect. 
"Bristol-Myers was correct in saying that 
were certain things they couldn't 
do without our permission," he said. "Both 
they and the University moved at light-
speed to make this change." 

And as co criticisms that Yale 
refused to ever make publicly 
available the discussion with 
Bristol-Meyers and the contract 
itself? Soderstrom defends the 
decision as typical business pol-
icy. "The fact that we don't 
negotiate things like this in 
public says that's not the way 
you get things done in corpora-
tions. We didn't have all the 
answers, and we needed time to 
talk 
Bristol-Myers. We 
weren't forced to do anything 
we didn't want to do." Yale and 
were 
simply 
"moving at the speed of busi-
ness," and in mid-March, the 
process proved fruitful.

MARcH 14, Yale and Bristol-Myers 
Squibb issued simultaneous press releases: 
The University, expressing its pride at hav-
ing "helped prolong the lives of so many 
who suffer from AIDs," said 
that it had removed all obsta-
cles preventing Bristol-Myers 
from making <4T available at 
low cost in South Africa; Bristol-
Myers, for its part, announced that it 
would make Zerit and Vide.x, another 
AIDS medicine, available below cost · 
not try to prevent cheaper generic ver-
sions of the drugs from being produced, 
imported, and sold in South Africa. "The 
company," the announcement proudly 
proclaimed, "has no other patent rights in 
Africa which it will allow to prevent AIDS 
therapy there." 

Headlines around the world 
cheered the unprecedented move, 
lauding both the University and 
Bristol-Myers. Yale enthusiastically 
patted the company on the back. 
"Bristol-Myers came up with a more com-
prehensive and far-reaching solution than 
any other pharmaceutical company," said 
Soderstrom. 

"This is 
unprecedented 
change, and they should be applauded for 
that." In this age of compassionate conse~-
