ON SEPTEMBER 18, 1992, JJ 4=35 A.M., resi-
dents on East Shore's Townsend Avenue 
were awakened to find the back of a neigh-
boring house ablaze. Within minutes of 
their arrival, investigators were certain the 
ftre was the work of an arsonist hoping to 
prevent any former residents of the pre-
dominantly black Elm Haven housing pro-
ject from moving to the neighborhood. 

The pattern was repeated twice in the next 
six weeks. In 2001, as New Haven prepares 
to complete the demolition of Elm Haven, 
East Shore has incorporated these new 
arrivals, but the success of efforts to change 
its residents' minds remains equivocal. 

East Shore sits across the Quinnipiac 
River from the rest of New Haven, an awk-
ward 
and 
sometimes 
troublesome 
appendage. Part of East Shore once 
belonged to East Haven, but was sold to 
New Haven and finally incorporated in 
1918. Since then, East Shore has had a trou-
bled relationship with both cities, sharing 
New Haven's ta.x burden while socially 
resembling its more 
suburban neighbor. 

The East Shore of a 
decade 
ago 
is 
described as having 
its "roots in the Hill 
and in Wooster Square. It is a homoge-
neous neighborhood. About 75 percent of 
its people :ftc Italian Roman Catholics and 
most of the rest are Irish Roman Catholics. 
A large number of residents attend Saint 
Bernadette's 
Church 
on 
Townsend 
Avenue." 

In the summer of 1991, with the demo-
lition of 366 units of the city's Elm Haven 
housing project, the federal government 
ordered that New Haven find housing for 
half of those who had been displaced. The 
government order further stipulated that 
this housing be "scattered-site" -not in 
areas zoned for low-income housing devel-
opments, but in middle-<:lass neighbor-
hoods. In the city of New Haven, this left 
little choice but East Shore. 

The New Haven Housing Authority 
purchased eleven homes in the area in 
January of 1992. The reaction in East Shore 
was immediate. Homeowners expressed 
concerns about property value, knowing 
the Housing Authority's dismal record. 
They were also concerned about the gap 
that would be left in taX revenues when 
those homes used for the scattered-site pro-
gram were taken off ta.x rolls. The news 
came on the heels of a jump in real estate 
taxes. 

Seven months after the program was 
instituted, some of the residents' fears bad 
been realized as these properties stood 
vacant and uncared for. Then the fires 
started. 

While 
a 
plaque on 
Saint 
reads, 
"Saint 
Bernadene Parish Community Welcomes 
You," someone was sending a different 
message to the families who would soon 
occupy these homes. The ftre on Townsend 
Avenue was the first. Within six weeks, twO 
more fires were set and tern~ flared. 

Opponents of scattered-site housing 
grew more vocal and defensive, its support-
ers more vehement and embittered, and the 
issue quickly became polarized by race. In 
response, the Reverend Howard J. Nash, a 
pastor at Saint Bernadette's Church, orga-
nized a series of interfaith meetings cen-
tered on acceptance. "At the rime we had 
no idea who might have been doing this. I 
just didn't want to see any violence or any 
acts ofhatred," Nash said. Morris Cove res-
ident Edward Flynn recalled, "The meeting 
focused on brotherhood. 'We're all mem-
bers of the human race,' that was the mes-
sage, and the audience was a mixed one, 
over 500 people." 

Despite these efforts, tensions contin-
ued. John Daniels, recently elected New 
Haven's first Mrican-American mayor, 
organized a rally of his own on the site of 
one of the burned homes. While the rally 
was designed to express outrage at the 
seemingly racially motivated arson, East 
Shore residents saw it as an accusation. For 
months the R~ 
and Advocate op-ed 
pages rang with heated talk from both 
sides. "Race Not Involved." "Tax Revenue 
Lost." "It's Mayor's Fault." Daniels and the 
local NAACP saw racism in other letters to 
the editor such as one that begged, "Who 
wants a slum next door?" Another con-
cerned citizen urged, "Leadership Needed." 

Indeed, leadership was the missing piece, as 
each faction had its supporters but few 
were "committed to bringing all sides and 
all points of view together." 

Tensions over the scattered-site hous-
ing began to dissipate as agreements were 
reached over the care of property and pri-
vate management was appointed for the 
homes. Yet, in 1993 continued economic 
trouble combined with earlier tensions 
instigated a movement among East Shore 
residents to secede from the city. Their rea-
sons included high t.aJCltion, low quality 
social services, and lack of representation. 
The movement had strong support from 
some, but it became clear the secessionist
