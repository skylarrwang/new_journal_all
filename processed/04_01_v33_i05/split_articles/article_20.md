EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
I take the Metro-North train from New Haven to New York at least 
four times a semester . 

This semester, I decided to get off the 
train at every stop and explore each town until the next train carne 
one hour later. 

I brought my camera and shot about one roll at each 
town. I was attracted to slippages in time, the kind of photographs 
that could have been taken any time in the last four decades. 
Even 
as I wrote the name of the city on each canister of film, I knew I 
could not capture a town in one hour and thirty-six photographs. 

After photographing seven towns, I realized that I was drawn the 
most to New Haven's three closest towns -Milford, Stratford, and 
Bridgeport. 

I went back again and again, intrigued by their close 
proximity to and distance from my life at Yale. 

I revisited my 
favorite things, like the mancoon cat that lived in the gun shop in 
Stratford and the abandoned storefronts in Bridgeport. 

I made 
friends and began to feel like an insider in these towns. 

Now it 
makes more sense to me that I am registered to vote in Connecticut.
