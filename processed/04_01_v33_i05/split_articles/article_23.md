I AM A WOMAN IN MY FINAL YEAR AT YALE. Today is Friday and by Monday everything will be 
different. Not different in a little way, but rest-of-your-life different. Suddenly, living a life in 
Manhattan on $10,000 is a possible concern, and then comes the next six months ... the demands 
of graduate school, jobs, careers, life. This is my future, and it's 
standing outside, if I'll only let it in. I keep hoping that 
maybe along with my diploma, Dick will hand me an 
instruction booklet: 
Dear Graduate, Welcome to your life post-Yale! Our 
first step is to contact all those successful Yale alumni, 
who will instruct you further on how to attain ultimate 
happiness and fulfillment both professionally AND emo-
tionally ... Worry not: Those $120,000 were well-invested. 
But life is more complicated than that. And I am per-
plexed. In a small English-language bookstore in Paris last 
spring, I found a beat-up copy of The Feminine Mystique. 
Living in Paris, reading Friedan, I wondered where I would be in 
a year, five years. Where would we all be in five years? I 
became so interested in these questions that, like 
any good Yale student, I decided to write my 
senior essay about them. But my essay does not 
address issues of the future for every Yale gradu-
ate. I am not Everyman; I am one woman. 
Therefore I chose to look at one specific group: 
Yale women. 

Thirty years after the explosion of feminism, 
millions of women struggle to balance a professional 
career and a stable family. The question is no longer 
whether to do one or the other, but how to do both. 
Women of my generation have found that it is now their turn 
to ask themselves this question. A Yale woman's identity is in 
flux, its nature discussed daily in dorm rooms, apartments, bars, 
dining halls, and classrooms. We think both long and short-term 
and wonder where to anchor our identities. I and every other woman 
I know stand at this edge, asking ourselves, "How do I come to decide 
what makes life worthwhile?" 

The history of women at Yale has been one of stops and starts. Back in 
1783, Ezra Stiles wrote up a sheepskin parchment for one of his private female 
students, noting that were it not for her sex she would surely have been a member of the Yale 
freshman class. In 1886, another ambitious woman applied to Yale Law School. She was admitted 
and managed to graduate, narrowly escaping the wrath of the Yale Corporation, which quickly 
instituted a rule that no woman could belong to any class save the ones already enrolled in the School 
of Arts and Sciences. So, for 268 years of Yale College's illustrious history no woman roamed its hallowed 
halls until the "experiment" of 1969. 580 women were selected from an applicant pool of 5,000 to be the 
first female Yalies. La creme de la creme, ma cherie. Lauded as "superwomen", they were photographed end-
lessly by The New York Times, Newsweek, Look, and Life, not to mention all the women's magazines that spec-
ulated about their dating lives in full-page spreads. That spring, as Kingman Brewster uttered the tradition-
al Yale promise to graduate the next "1000 male leaders of the future", for the first time dissension was heard 
among the ranks. 


For the class of 2004, 6549 women and 
6338 men applied, yet there was a 16.6 per-
cent admission rate for men, versus only 15 
percent for women. The final class standing 
is 674 men and 678 women. The unequal 
rate of admission is done to compensate for 
the higher matriculation rate among 
women. Old Blue wants to keep things bal-
anced- and rightfully so. However, my 
point is, it's damn hard to get into Yale and 
it's even harder if you're a girl. 

In a 1987 article entitled "The Next 
Steps for the Superwomen," the Yale 
Alumni Magazine explored the fate of 
female Yalies after graduation: "The possi-
bility that these extraordinary young 
women might become leaders-the con-
ventional destiny of their male classmates 
for centuries--[then] seemed more remote. 
It is now taken for granted." We are all, 
men and women, trained to be "super." We 
look at the admission rates and our jaws 
drop-how did I make it here? To be a Yale 
graduate is something momentous. But my 
question is, how is it different for a 
woman? 

Every senior woman I know struggles 
with the idea of being a leader. We reach 
out to each other and talk, as if by talking 
we can sort through the messiness of all 
that awaits us in the real world. Some of us 
construct elaborate life plans: "Live in New 
York two years, grad school, marry around 
28 (don't want to be tied down too early), 
kid by 32, three years off, and back to 
work." Others live more in the moment: "I 
don't think in long term, only short term. I 
go from today to tomorrow and maybe to 
the next six months but can't really think 
beyond that, you know?" Some grapple 
with social conventions: "Yeah, I wanna get 
married. Marriage may be a societal con-
struction but it's one that I have bought 
completely." Or: "You know, the more I 
think about it, all I am doing is biding time 
till I can actually have a family. I know I am 
completely shunning the feminist doc-
trine; we are supposed to go out and take on 
the world, but what if I just want to have 
kids?" 

Most of the women I interviewed 
wanted it all. They don't want to enter the 
work force; they want to lead the work 
force. They want to find loving partners 
and have happy, fulfilling lives. As we make 
decisions about next year, the year after, the 
next five to ten years, we wonder how all 
the pieces of this puzzle will come together. 
APRIL 20, 2001 
Or if they will come together. I worry 
about how to balance ambition and life's 
realities. I worry about loving someone in 
L.A. from my apartment in Manhattan. I 
leave you with the voices of four Yale 
women who are facing the same difficul-
ties. In their voices anxiety and optimism, 
ambition and practicality, coexist as equal 
partners of a Yale woman's identity. Their 
openness and honesty have helped me 
define my own dilemma. 

I want great kids, I want to have a fab-
ulous relationship with my husband, and I 
want to be the best in my field. Maybe I could 
accept being topped by the Brits, no, wait, I 
want to be the best in my field. It may not 
happen because it may entail more sacrifice 
than I am willing to make, but in an ideal 
world that's what I want. 

I guess for me, success entails not only 
being happy and having a great family but 
also achieving a certain level in my career. If 
I'm 
a world-renowned doctor but had sac-
rificed marriage and family, and were mis-
erable, I wouldn't consider that success. But neither 
would I consider it success if I were simply 
a happy housewife. 

I thought I just wanted to be a high 
school science teacher- but that is not some-
thing you do when you go to Yale. Unless you 
do teach for America for a couple years and 
then you go to law school. Definitely people 
have this view that if you go to Yale you have 
to make something of it-you can't just be a 
housewife or something. You have to do some-
thing with that degree . . . I have very con-
flicting feelings about it . . . I don't need to 
have some big powerful career and I just want 
to do something that makes me happy. But 
then the other side of me is like but you went 
to Yale and you should use that .... 

I think that's why I've struggled for the 
past year and a half ... everyone is asking 
you, "so what are you going to be doing 
now?" And I'm expected to have an answer; I 
expect an answer-from myself ... And especially 
coming out of Yale the expectation that you're 
going to do something incredible. A lot of people 
don't know what they're going to do and 
they're just trying to find themselves and 
maybe there is nothing wrong with that. ...
