EAcH YEAR, COME EARLY MAY, the Yale Law 
School transforms into a battlefield. Lines 
are drawn, students and faculty cake sides, 
and fancy rhetoric spews forth from the 
mouths of soon-to-be litigious twen-
tysomethings. Words like "democracy" and 
"tyranny" are thrown around with rhe same 
conviction and gravity as they were in 
Franco's Spain. 

But what is at stake has less to do with 
the fate of nations than with the egos of a 
smattering of the school's students. It is in 
early May that the Yak Law journa~ the 
student-run law review of the nation's best 
law school (membership in which, accord-
ing to some, is a prerequisite for important 
clerkships and job offers from big firms), 
culls the top of the very top of the student 
body for membership. And it is the test 
that does the culling that causes the Law 
School's yearly turmoil. 

The test consists of two parts. The first 
asks students to compose a letter to the 
author of a submission to the journaL The 
second-the part that annually causes the 
brouhaha-is a test of students' "bluebook-
ing" ability. The Law School blue book 
bears lircle resemblance to the beloved Yak 
Colkge Programs of Study. To get an idea of 
what the future Supreme Court justices of 
America are subjected to, think of the MLA 
Handbook annotated by a Senate subcom-
mittee. Page upon page of the blue book-
and, consequently, hour upon hour of test-
takers' study time--is spent on the rules of 
comma placement and italicization. Major 
Supreme Court decisions are shorter and 
less complex chan the guidelines that 
answer the pressing question of when a 
comma should be italicized and inside the 
quotation mark. Or italicized and outside 
of it? Not italicized and outside of it? 
Underlined? What, pray tell, do the 
gods of jurisprudence say about the 
ever wily umlaut? Do we cooper-
ate, or do we cooperate? If you're 
perplexed, ask any one of the 
scores of law students clutch-
ing their blue book as a 
fanatical 
preacher might 
grasp his Bible. Be sure to 
approach them gently in the 
dining hall as they rack their 
brains to engage in what one law 
student affectionately calls "the utterly 
mind-numbing, useless memorization of 
thoroughly stupid details." 

It is the stupidity of this exercise, cou-
pled with the mythical importance of being 
on the journa4 that, according to dis-
senters, engenders the disgust and cynicism 
of each year's nay-sayers. Meetings at which 
students lodge complaints against the 
journal editors are announced. The infa-
mous Law School "Wall," the permanent 
site for the airing of grievances of all sorts, 
plays host to endless pronouncements of 
"Why I'm not going to tty for the Yale Law 
journaL" The Law School's comedy troupe, 
the Law Revue, scarcely lets a year go by in 
which they do not lampoon the Law 
journal for its ridiculous admissions prac-
tices. Last year, as the testing season 
approached, a group of progressive stu-
dents sold mugs emblazoned with the 
encouragement "Make love, not Law 
JournaL" It seems that none of the dis-
senters is really wrong. Is the memorization 
of ridiculously minuscule details the best 
way to distinguish the best of the best when 
admissions committee after admissions 
committee has already placed its impri-
matur on these students' resumes? The pro-
cedure for electing students to membership 
on the journal has less to do, some would 
argue, with the students' intellectual ability 
than with their ability to jump through yet 
another flaming hoop in order to prove 
their mettle. Couldn't they devise a more 
reasonable way to figure out who 
would contribute most to the 
journal? 

The unfortunate answer from 
journal supporters-who by and 
large acknowledge how ridiculous 
the 
admissions 
process 
must 
appear-is a resounding no. Simply 
put, bluebooking is what you do your 
first year or so on the journa4 so you have 
to be competent. If the explanation is so 
rational, then why the constant and vehe-
ment dissent? Perhaps it is because these 
students have danced the standardized-test-
meritocracy two-step for so long and have 
finally tired of it. Or perhaps they are final-
ly frightened of it. One journal survivor 
explained, "Yalies want merit badges, and 
too many of them just can't win this one."
