The American galleries at the Yale University Art Gallery 
all possible. Although his gold leaf has 
flaked off in the perilous fight, like the flag 
he is emphatically still there. 
Bierstadt's Yosnniu Valky, like the 
works in the Trumbull gallery, bears wit-
ness to the continuing king-of-the-moun-
tain battle between Europe and America to 
the peak of the Western tradition. But even 
in the paintings of the Hudson River 
School, whose artists rejected the monu-
ments of classical Europe in favor of the 
natural beauty of God's canvas, the 
European aesthetic still rules: Yosemite is 
_beautiful not so much in itself, but because 
it outdoes Chartres in majesty. Even among 
the genre scenes of cranberry gatherers and 
the still lives of the American flora the fig-
ure of the glorious European dandy still 
lurks here in the work of Thomas 
Horenden. As we come nearer to the pre-
sent, the line between European and 
American art blurs further as the very best 
American city-, sea-, and landscapes-all 
in the style of the Impressionists---cover 
the gallery walls. 

The decorative arts galleries present a 
narrative that likewise drifts from its origi-
nal thesis. From the patriotic, frontier 
heroism of the joint-stool, we move to the 
sophisticated European revivals of the 
18oos, then to the more familiar designs of 
the early wth century. This is no longer 
your great-great-grandfather's attic, but 
your own. My mother's Revere Ware pots, 
or at least the original 1936 design, are in 
the Modernist room. So is my grandmoth-
er's Electrolux vacuum. The aura of mirac-
ulous survival no longer surrounds the 
objects, and the viewer is left to look into

the cases with contradictory motivations: 
Should I stand in solemn contemplation, 
or put the spaghetti on the stove and sweep 
the floor? One cannot help but feel con-
fused in the Contemporary Design room, 
which enshrines a bright orange i-Book 
and those skin-chilling black metal chairs 
that are ubiquitous on the Yale campus. It 
takes a bit of false consciousness to install 
these "artifacts" alongside the joint-stool; 
the curator plays the time-capsule game, 
guessing that hundreds of years into the 
future, the laptop and the dorm-room 
accessory will be the iconic emblems of the 
lives we lived. 

It is fitting for the gallery's narrative to 
end with the art of the 40s and 50s. T his 
was the turning point in the American pro-
. ject, when we finally got the upper hand on 
the Continentals and New York became 
the center of the art world. But we did so 
by a process of artistic globalization: the 
American and the European blended into 
one. The museum's layout as a whole con-
firms this: Through the door of the 
American galleries are the modern and con-
temporary rooms, the fusion point of the 
museum's European and American collec-
tions. But something was lost on both sides 
in the process. Nothing captures this better 
than the series of paintings along the left 
wall at the end of the gr~d salon-we see 
the transformation happen before us, pass-
ing from Marsden H artley's elegiac Last 
Stone Walls, Dogtown to the cold concrete 
elegance of Arnold W irz's 
American 
Landscape to the geometric abstraction of 
Morton 
Livingston 
Schaumburg's 
Machine. 

This was also the point. when art got 
away from us, defying the concept that 
seemed proper a few rooms back of a 
uniquely "American" gallery. In the first 
room beyond the American wing hang the 
works of quintessentially American artists 
like 
Jasper 
Johns 
and 
Robert 
Rauschenberg, shoved outdoors like the 
children the curators know will misbehave 
when the company comes to visit, ruining 
the happy family illusion. We see them 
eventually, however, and the story we've 
been led to believe is suddenly no longer 
relevant. In effect, the viewer is left inside a 
Hopper painting, waiting like that woman 
in the hotel room white-knuckling the bed-
post, afraid to venture out inro the world 
we've shaped in our own image. We're 
afraid because we're still comfortable with 
the old narrative. We refuse to leave and 
thus get stuck, not knowing any longer 
how to respond to art. 

Even our response to the iconoclastic 
Taliban despots is simply another example 
of our growing uncertainties. One couldn't 
help but wince when the Grand Mullah 
pointed out that, for all of our clamoring 
about two stone statues, no one has rushed 
in to feed the children in Afghanistan who 
are starving as a result of UN sanctions. 
After all, they are just as innocent of the 
Taliban's atrocities as the two Buddhas 
carved out of the rock. Hateful as his 
regime is, the Mullah had a point. H is 
comments were yet another signal that our 
Enlightenment attitudes toward art are ill-
fitted to the contemporary world. Yet these 
artirudes are nor going to change on their 
own. The first place to look for the neces-
sary cultural redefinition ought to be the 
temple of artistic culture itself-the muse-
um. The Yale University Art Gallery, how-
ever, has passed at its chance to provide any 
new insight. T he new American galleries 
stick to the script of 1793, and they play it 
well. But as one passes through the exhibit, 
the narrative at its foundation becomes less 
and less apt. One leaves with the disheart-
ening feeling that the final monologue, the 
speech that makes our progression from 
John Trumbull to Jackson Pollack explicit-
ly clear, has yet to be spoken.
