~~~HEN I MET NEwsCHANNEL 8 CORRESPONDENT Erin 
r r 
1 
Cox one gray morning, she was rushing back to her 
Waterbury bureau with a copy of rhe daily R~pub/ican-Amnican in 
hand. Its name to the contrary, the ~ublican-Amnican is a non-
partisan look at local news, and it's rhe first place a good reporter 
looks for leads every morning (rhough she prefers to get ideas on 
her own). 
Today was slow. 

There was a story about state mastery rest scores. They were up 
a little, especially in Hartford. Scores, said Erin (everyone's on a 
first-name basis in the TV biz), usually make good local news. They 
get regular people worked up about schools. Regulae people ace rhe 
good guys in rhe local news world, and bad scores vindicate rhem 
in their eternal struggle against the government. That isn't quite 
how Erin put it, but it's basically her job to tell variations on this 
narrative every day. Despite rhe appeal, however, it's hard to turn 
mediocre scores into good television. "I like to tell stories," Erin 
said, and, it seems, there isn't much of a story here; just rhe scores, 
which rhe ~ublican-Ammcan already published. 

It was time ro see what else was on the ledger. An NFL superstar 
named Lincoln Kennedy was in rhe news for some reason. "He 
must have had interesting parents," I said. "Yeah," she said. "Both 
Democrats." Erin had never heard of Lincoln Kennedy, rho ugh, so 
that story was out. 

There was a controversy over rhe appointment of rhe new 
interim Waterbury Schools Superintendent. Erin had covered this 
already-in fact, she got the scoop. 

But the ~ublican-Ammcan got the first shot at covering rhe 
raise that Waterbury gave its Chief of Finance. "Interesting," Erin 
said. "But it's not only not video; it's a one-town story." Later, she 
continued, "Nor all stories are interesting to everyone. Some stories 
are informative--you know, about taXes. But sometimes they're 
entertaining, too--maybe a new school gym opening, and that's 
fun." If only a new school gym were opening today. 

Then Erin started: "Oh, look, there's a great rhing here about 
the pink things you can buy for Valentine's Day. Cute!" Erin is an 
uncommonly nice woman of about 33 who acts more girlish than 
she probably is. There was a Beanie Baby on her computer, 
slouched next to a Smwf. She has pictures of kids all over the office. 
"Is that your daughter?" I asked, pointing to one. "No," she said, a 
little sadly. "All these pictures are nieces and nephews." Erin's nor 
married and she doesn't have kids-"no one would care if I .died in 
a helicopter crash," she said-but I son of hoped someone cared 
enough to get her somerhing pink. 

Okay, okay, we weren't gerting anywhere. Were there any good 
stories? The New Haven bureau, Erin said, was going to do a fol-
low-up on the crane rhat had collapsed in Milford the day before. 
Two people had died. One guy was pinned for eight hours, his legs 
crushed under the extraordinary weight of the crane. This was a 
great story, because Chopper-8 had gotten it all on camera-in fact, 
they'd scunled pact of Erin's piece to shoot the last scenes. "For 
chose people that tried to rescue him, it must have been moment by 
moment. It was like rhat whole Jessica-in-the-well thing over 
again." Jessica-in-the-well is the Holy Grail of TV news ... 1 mean, it 
was awful ... but it was great TV." 

Today clearly wasn't going to be a day for great TV. "It doesn't 
look like a weather-story day," she said, drawing the drapes. The 
snow was too light. Erin had to think of something, though, before 
the daily 9:30AM conference call when the Waterbury bureau swaps 
ideas with the New Haven bureau. I should probably now reveal the 
little-known but easily discoverable fact rhat Erin herself is the 
Waterbury bureau. No other reporters, no secretary. Just Erin and 
her cameraman, AI Mack-they even do rheir own cleaning. The 
office, in a Marriott, is pretty small: just big enough for some edit-
ing equipment, a computer, a fax machine, and a TV with CNN. Erin 
had rurned the TV on when she first got in, but the sound was down 
and I don't think she paid much artention. It was mostly there for 
the ambiance. 
THE NEw JouRNAL 


Al wasn't here yet. He was out Â£ilming the weather, as he often 
does on snowy mornings. But Al apparently likes co remain behind 
the camera. Erin cold me he didn't wane me co ask him any ques-
tions or quote him. 

Ten AM: time for the 9:30 conference calL The New Haven 
folks (TV news people say "folks" a lot) didn't have a lot of good 
ideas. Someone was pushing. a piece on che city of Seymour, which, 
deep in debe, had recently assessed all its homeowners an extra 
property tax. "The city's a mess," Erin said. "If I were a homeown-
er, I'd go nuts." Erin doesn't seem co like taxes coo much, but coday 
she didn't dislike them enough co do a story on them. She had 
another idea: a smalJ town in northwestern Connecticut called 
Winsted has eight miles of dirty pipes, and some of the cap water is 
discolored. Things really started co heat up this month when a few 
residents refused co pay their property taxes until the city deans the 
water. "I love a yellow-water story," the producer in New Haven 
said. 

It was decided. Erin starred making phone calls. 

Al got back around 10:30. He was a big teutonic guy with a 
strong jaw, wearing a blue Communication Workers of America 
jacket. We shook hands without saying much, and he sac down co 
edit the weather footage. Today was special because Al had shoes of 
his dalmatian, Charlie, romping through the snow. Even more spe-
cial: we learned that the anchor was going co mention Charlie by 
name. Al swore softly as he worked. 

Meanwhile, Erin got ready ro go. She showed me her heavy-
duty winter-wear, which was boots with rights and thick socks 
underneath her navy-blue pantsuit. "Always be prepared. You 
know," she said, "people think I go around with a can of hairspray 
and rube of lipstick." She thought for a second: "And, I do-but I 
also have co bring warm clothes." Erin admitted that part of her job 
is looking good, which is especially hard on days like today, when 
she's feeling sick. Despite the hardship, she shellacked make-up on 
her face like a real pro. In the end, she looked sort of like a dressed-
FEBRUARY II, 2000 
for-success porcelain doH. This is how all TV reporrers-men and 
women-look in person. 

Before we left, I asked Erin if it was ever difficult for her co 
remain objective about cases like this. "If I cold you I didn't have 
opinions, I'd be lying. But part of the fun is you teH a story-if you 
already know how it's going to end, it's no fun." 

Finally, it was time to cake the Stormteam-8 Explorer to 
Winsted. Erin's original idea was co knock on doors at random and 
ask about the water. But she happened co gee lucky and catch 
Charlene St. Sauveur on the phone before we arrived. Charlene was 
at home with her husband, Jim (who, ironically, works for a water-
filter company) and her 22-month-old son, Sean Patrick. Erin was 
psyched because, as it turned out, Sean Patrick was her brother's 
name. She kept cooing about how great the baby was: "God bless 
him," she would say, "he's really being very good." Erin is very 
friendly. In point of face, the baby was whiny, imperious, and prob-
ably too old to have a pacifier. But I think Erin honestly didn't har-
bor any of these thoughts, or if she did, she didn't welcome them 
the way I did. Instead, she seemed taken with Charlene's domestic 
bliss. She and Charlene connected right away-Jim talked to Al for 
a little while, but it soon became clear Jim wasn't going to be part 
of the story. He just didn't seem co care as deeply as Charlene. 

The house was cluctered with all kinds of tchocchkes: a two-
foot princess doll encased in glass, a set of 12 Pillsbury Doughboy 
figurines, one for each month, "Family Circus" cartoons pasted to 
the refrigerator, Barney on the TV {with no one watching). To make 
matters worse, Erin, Al, and I had cracked in a good deal of dirty 
snow that Charlene, in her socks, tried surreptitiously co wipe up 
from time co time. 

Now it was time for Erin to find out the facts. Charlene said 
the water in the pipes was discolored. The color was the main prob-
lem with it, actually, because the lab analysis bad come back nega-
tive for bacteria and harmful minerals. In fact, the city claimed the 
water was safe to drink. Charlene, however, wondered if there was
