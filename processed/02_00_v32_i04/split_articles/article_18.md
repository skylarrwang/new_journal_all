at the city. And not a moment too soon. 

When we left Chatlene's place, it was time 
to pay a visit to those government thugs. 
The town manager, Karen Johnson, 
wasn't available, so Erin wouldn't be able to 
interview her. That was bad, because it 
wouldn't be possible to find out what 
would happen if Charlene and Leesa didn't 
pay their taxes. Plus, the story looked a little
lopsided, showing only the protestors' 
point of view. 

So we stopped by the office of the 
Winsted Director of Public Works. In a 
moment of gonzo, Erin had Al bring the 
camera and asked to see the Director, Pat 
Hague, who turned out to be in. Pat Hague 
was a middle-aged guy dressed in jeans and 
a work shirt and smoking a cigarette. His 
everyday-Joe countenance made him a 
sympathetic character in person, but it didn't
seem to come through in front of the 
camera. He was obviously a little nervous-
especially after the job Fox61 had 
done on his office, as he told us. Unlike 
Charlene and Leesa, however, he didn't 
seem to have learned anything from this 
experience, because what he said was really 
stupid: "This water is safe to drink-it's 
discolored ... I wouldn't drink it neither." In 
retrospect, I wondered if the fact that the 
city gives away bottled drinking water 
made up for Pat's view. But at the time, 
Erin, Al, and I were all thinking, gotcha! 
Erin said gleefully, "People say the media 
distorts, but he really said that." And later, 
"I didn't even have to ask a leading question." 
But what most scandalized Erin was 
Pat's smoking in a public building, which, 
she whispered to Al, "is a federal offense." 

Now it was back to the office to edit. 
Al had a lot of stuff on tape, and it had to 
be boiled down to one minute and thirty 
seconds of news-like turning sap into 
maple syrup. Erin wrote the copy quickly 
and effortlessly, while Al cut and pasted the 
video, at turns swearing and apologizing 
for swearing. 

The editing process was almost as surreal
as the filming process. Erin narrated 
the action in her news-voice. "The water 
from Charlene St. Sauveur's faucet is dirty," 
she said, as Charlene drew a bath of relatively
clear water. Then a shot of the water 
bottle Linda had brought over, as Charlene 
spoke: "It has a yellow tint to it, a dark 
brown tint to it." No one mentioned that 
the water we were looking at was not from 
Charlene's faucet. Later, Charlene's voice 
said, "We're not going to pay anything 
until they give us clean, healthy water," as 
they cut back to the bath. But since the 
bath was full of clear water, it didn't make 
much sense. The problem is that water 
could be poisonous or it could be safe and 
you can't tell the difference just by looking. 
You can only tell by testing it. On TV, 
though, the boring old test gets short shrift 
compared to the great visuals of (the neighbors')
yellow water. 

More egregiously, Charlene and Leesa 
admitted they didn't know any other 
Winsted residents who weren't paying their 
taxes. Leesa said she didn't understand why 
more people weren't protesting like her-
but that bite didn't make it onto the show. 
Since Charlene and Leesa were the only 
two folks Erin talked to, on TV their vigi-
lantism looked like a popular revolt. When 
Erin said, "Folks were more than insulted 
when they got their water bills," she meant 
the two of them, not the town generally. 
But you couldn't have known that from 
watching the show. Then, Erin narrated, 
"Clean water may not come right around 
the corner. City officials say the problem is 
probably the old pipes." That's true. But 
Erin didn't mention the prohibitively high 
cost of fixing the problem, especially in 
light of the fact that the water tested nega-
tive for bacteria and minerals. Instead, the 
city looked like a mom that didn't care 
about her kids enough to give them clean 
water, while Charlene and Leesa looked 
like moms who did. 

After the story ran, Keith, the anchor, 
cut to Erin live in the Waterbury studio. 
She said, "We tried to find out what would 
happen to Charlene and Leesa if they didn't
pay their water bills, but the town man-
ager did not return our repeated phone 
calls." In the real world, the folks at the 
Winsted town manager's office could have 
been too busy with work to make the five 
o'clock news. But through the myopic eye 
of the camera, their absence seemed sinister. 
On TV, it seems, if you don't show up, 
you lose.
