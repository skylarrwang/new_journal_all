welcome Yale's expansion as a commercial 
landowner. Claire Criscuolo of Claire's 
Corner Copia lauds Yale's current commu-
niry involvement, especially Yale's acquisi-
tion of the building that houses her restau-
rant. "Does Yale own a lor of properry? Yes, 
they do. And rhey should." Yale's claims 
and rhe cescimony of small-business owners 
make a srrong case for the benefits of Yale's 
growing role in fostering both public and 
privace secror growth. These fail, however, 
ro eradicate deep-seated doubt in che com-
muniry about the future ofNew Haven. 

Is this efforr roo linle, too late? The 
question unites many of the ciry's most dis-
parate elements in an answer: yes. "I think 
[Yale's] changing things now, bur they're so 
far behind, they need to put forrh a massive 
efforr jusc ro catch up. I don't see a massive 
efforr," deplores Schiavone. He pain ts a 
srarding picture of a ciry unerly ravaged: 
"There are only two people left in New 
Haven: the ciry and Yale ... They're the two 
czars who have been on a battlefield for the 
pasc fifty years and they end up in a waste-
land." The former developer peers wistful-
ly out at his hometown from his third-floor 
office on Chapel Srreer. "Everything is 
gone and they're the only two people left to 
care." Schiavone is nor alone in his 
account. "What gets me most upset is the 
gap between what is and what could be. It's 
a tragedy," lamencs Wolff. Alderman 
Gonzalez affirms this suspicion of Yale in 
the local comrnuniry. Yale officials are 
quick 
to 
dismiss 
such 
dissenters. 
"Describing New Haven as a 'wasteland' is 
truly ridiculous ... the only wasteland is 
between the ears of New Haven's detrac-
tors," says Morand. 

WHILE CITY OFFICIALS AND YALE may care 
abour New Haven, critics agree that only 
Yale has the resources to effect dramatic 
changes. The universiry's vision, if realized, 
will determine New Haven's future. Quick 
to claim knowledge of the universiry's long-
term plan for New Haven, Wolff paints 
Yale as a quiecly manipulative institution 
with the unspoken intention of making 
drastic changes. As he describes it, Yale 
wants to reduce the city's population to half 
of its current size, letting poverty drive out 
less desirable residents; in the wake of this 
urban cleansing, only Yale employees and 
wealthy commuters would remain. "It'll be 
a nice 'college town.' They would really like 
that. They don't have quite enough power 
to do it, but they're biding their time. 
Therefore they don't want too much of a 
wonderful program for poor people 
~cause they'd like them to go." 

Schiavone also sees New Haven mov-
ing in the direction of a "college town." But 
for him, this vision should not be con-
demned-it is the only option left. "Forget 
creating a commercial center with high rise 
buildings," he wrote in the early '90s, "real-
ize that we can't ever become a tourist des-
tination; and accept the happy F.ue--we are 
now and maybe always will be a college 
town." Accordingly, Schiavone condones 
what he portrays as Yale's control of local 
decision-making. "[Politicians] should be 
in Yale's pocket. There's nobody else." 

There is little idealism in Schiavone's 
words. To him, there is no room for such 
notions in a city with only one path out of 
economic 
desolation. 
Nonetheless, 
Schiavone faults Yale's past and current 
involvement with the city for being fur too 
feeble to make any substantial change. 

So what does he want? Yale to replace 
him. With no private-sector leadership left, 
the university needs to fill the vacuum. 
Yale, he maintains, ought to invest in mak-
ing New Haven attractive for its own 
benefit-to draw top students and facul-
ty-and in the process desig.n a cute and 
comfortable college town. Although such 
self-interest is cannon-fodder for many of 
Yale's critics, he claims that philanthropic 
alms-giving only exacerbates the situation. 
"IfYale tries to solve all the problems of the 
poor, and doesn't cry to solve its own prob-
lems, then everyone gets dragged down 
into the mud ... Dwight Hall is nauseat-
ing." In Schiavone's vision, capitalistic 
endeavors are the only way to resurrect 
New Haven: "Yale's self-interest is our sal-
vation." 

But even this faithÂ· in the healing pow-
ers of self-interested investment does not 
give him confidence that a solution to New 
Haven's problems is fast emerging. Until 
the university confronts the extent of the 
economic barrenness, the destitution, and 
deep bitterness sewn into the social fabric 
of the community, it can never effectively 
rum things around. "[Yale] people don't 
understand the depth of the problem." 

Rick Wolff, in very similar language, points 
to building animosity and resentment 
toward Yale, and he looks ahead, to a time 
when the current economic boom collaps-
es. "When the recession comes to New 
Haven, all the Yale police in the world 
won't be able to stop these problems. All 
these poor people living within a stone's 
throw of the campus are going to come 
over the fence." 

THE l:lALF-CENTURY STORY of New Haven's 
decay is a deeply human one, and irs costs 
must be measured in human terms. "All of 
our kids have left town. Nobody has kids 
left in New Haven," remarks Schiavone. 
"That is the most damning comment you 
can make." 

In the eyes of many in the local com-
muniry-Schiavone, Wolff, Bass-Yale has 
emerged from this vast historical landscape 
with the future of New Haven in its hands. 
"At this point, New Haven's economy is so 
dependent on Yale ... that leaders welcome 
whatever Yale will do," says Paul Bass. Yale 
is in a position of power like never before. 
The way the university will play out irs role 
remains to be seen, but it is clear that the 
city has reached a critical juncture. 

Whatever path it chooses, Yale will 
have to reconcile with the animosity many 
residents feel toward the un iversity. 
Shaping irs Long-term vision will require 
careful examination of the complex eco-
nomic forces, including Yale's own pres-
ence, that have brought New Haven to its 
present situation. Most important, Yale 
must act with the constant awareness that 
whatever it does-or does not do--will 
affect tens of thousands of lives.
