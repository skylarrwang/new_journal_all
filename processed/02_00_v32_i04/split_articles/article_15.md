Like it or not, Yale is now 
the only player in New 
Haven Development.

VERY SuNDAY NIGHT at Branford's Chowder Pot III restaurant, 
patrons eat, mingle and dance to the Dixieland tunes of the 
Galvanized Jazz Band. Most of the couples stepping deftly across 
the dance floor have white hair. The band itself has been playing 
weekly for almost 30 years. The Chowder Pot is hardly the type of 
place where one would expect to find one of New Haven's most 
influential developers. Nevertheless, Joel Schiavone is center-stage, 
strumming a banjo and belting out an occasional ballad alongside 
the band's six other members. 

Since returning to New Haven in 1971 after earning an MBA 
from Harvard and managing a string of nightclubs, Schiavone has 
played a central, though controversial, role in the city's develop-
ment. "This guy's a Connecticut legend," one diner informs his 
companion at a table set back from the dance floor. "He's one of the 
most famous people in Connecticut." 

After decades of banjo and real estate, and even a brief foray 
into Republican politics, Schiavone is giving up on his hometown. 
"I'm trying to get out of New Haven. I'm tired of it. I've been talk-
ing about [revitalization] for thirty years ap.d made absolutely no 
._ en 
progress." Schiavone, a 1958 Yale gcad~ate and native New Havener, 
.first entered the local real estate market in 1979 and quickly came to 
dominate. the city's small downtown. He has owned several apart· 
ment and office buildings, and was central in the redevelopment of 
the Palace Theater. By 1985, Schiavone controlled Chapel Street 
between High and College and quickly transformed the dilapi<Jat-
ed strip into the commercial center it is today. 

fu New Haven's economy turned downward, however,

for bankruptcy. In 1993, the Federal Deposit Insurance 
e 
Corporation (FDIC) inherited the bank's share of the properties 
and became the dominant partner. While Schiavone contin-
ued to manage the properties, he had lost control of their fate. 

Finally, in 1998, Yale purchased the buildings at the request of 
the city. Corning in the wake of expanded interest in commercial 
development, this incursion into the local real estate market bred 
suspicion and, in certain circles, resentment. 

Schiavone's story is not unique, but it is significant in light of 
the shifting power structure in New Haven. Yale's voice has long 
0 
been a prominent one, but in the past there we're others to bal-
n e 
ance it. Now those other voices have dropped away, leaving 
Yale's preeminent. Yale has been integral in designing and 
implementing various urban renewal and redevelopment pro-
posals over the past 50 years. What is new is the starkness of the 
contrast between Yale's tremendous wealth and investment poten-
tial and the city's relative poverty. This gives the university the 
unprecedented ability-and, according to some, responsibility-to 
shape New Haven. As Schiavone and his fellow power-players fade 
from the limelight, the burden of defining the course of the city's 
development falls on Yale, and the future of New Haven may hang 
in the balance. 
THE NEw JouRNAL 


"NEW HAVEN WAS CONSIDERED A PLACE tO which aJl sortS of people 
wanted to move back in the lsos and '6os," reminisces Rick Wolff, 
a New Haven resident and. Yale PhD, who commutes to the 
University of Massachusetts to teach economics. Over the past half-
century, New Haven has become a symbol of urban economic 
decline with the usual social problems-poverty, crime, drugs, pros-
titution, AIDs-and a test case for urban renewal efforts. Yale's rise 
to preeminence against this dismal backdrop was not sudden. It 
resulted from an extended history of other community forces losing 
their power after failed urban renewal attempts. 

By the late 1950s a post-war exodus of industry left New Haven 
one of the poorest cities in the nation. However, unlike other down-
towns in similar decline, New H aven had a unique and attractive 
resource: Yale, one of the wealthiest universities in the world. Local 
political figures latched on to this unusual marriage of urban 
decline and academic prestige and used it to secure federal grant 
money for redevelopment, touting New Haven as a laboratory for 
testing solutions to urban problems in the United States. In the 
1960s, Yale designed anti-poverty measures aimed at creating jobs 
and improving the welfare system. When those efforts yielded mea-
vigorate irs dying downtown. Although redevelopment attempts 
had brought little benefit to the city as a whole, development con-
tinued to be a lucrative business in New Haven, particularly because 
government subsidies accompanied by tax-abatementS made invest-
mentS relatively low risk. Schiavone was successfUl for several years, 
embarking on ambitious projectS to draw upscale shoppers to the 
Chapel Street area and the Ninth Square district, as well as working 
to create a theater district. He also quickly became one of New 
Haven's most eccentric and controversial public figures. "In the 
1980s, he was a lightning rod for criticism of City Hall's trickle 
down policies, tax breaks for the rich, and his eviction of poor peo-
ple despite receiving city help," says New Haven Advocate Associate 
Editor Paul Bass. Schiavone, however, portrays himself as an exam-
ple for positive and lasting urban renewal and, indeed, many of his 
downtown projects, the Chapel Street shops in particular, have con-
tinued to prosper through the 1990s. 

The effortS of Schiavone and his colleagues were not sufficient 
to stave off New Haven's persistent economic decline. With Yale 
owning a huge proportion of the· most valuable real estate in New 
Haven and paying taxes on only one percent of it, the tax burden 
ger results, decision-mak-
ers embraced grandiose, 
university-researched rede-
velopment schemes that 
would fundamentally alter 
the city's physical layout. 

Since the earliest 
on local residents· had 
become the highest in the 
state--30 to 50 percent 
higher than in the sur-
rounding suburbs. The 
exodus of business and 
""When .the recession comes to New Haven, all the Yale 
police in the world won't be able to stop these prob-
lems. All these poor people living within a stone's 
throw of the campus are going to come over the fence., 
better-off residents left 
behind a poor urban population unable to support the kind of 
Aashy commercial downtown that the city had tried to create. 

attempts to revitalize New Haven, Yale has worked closely with the 
city and its governing elite to shape the course of urban renewal. For 
irs professors and students, the city serves as a real-life testing 
ground for theories and blueprints. In addition, the university 
receives considerable federal fUnding for irs research effortS. "To 
have New Haven fUnction as a lab opportunity for dozens of 
departments that do research not only benefitS the professors and 
studentS who actually do it, but it is actually a financial benefit for 
the university-a vehicle for keeping the government money 
Bowing into Yale," says Wolff. Since corning to New Haven in 1964, 
Wolff has extensively researched New Haven's economic decline 
and Yale's relations with the city during that process. 

The end of the 1960s and the beginning of the next decade 
brought the construction of two interstate highways which con-
verged in the center of New Haven's, and the state's, most densely 
populated neighborhood, and a downtown shopping district cen-
tered around the Chapel Square Mall. Such large-scale schemes gave 
rise to a third category of central policy-shapers--<ievelopers. This 
triad of Yale, city officials and developers envisioned New Haven as 
a bustling commercial center that would bring back the shoppers 
who had Bed to the suburbs in the preceding decades. Federal 
money Bowed in, professors researched plans, and private develop-
ers tore down, built up, renovated and overhauled the city's down-
town. 

By the time Schiavone came on to the real estate scene in 1979, 
New Haven had already undergone over a decade of effortS to rein-
FEBRUARY u, 2000 
The second half of the 1980s proved deadly to local business. 
Banks failed, developers went belly-up and the city witnessed what 
Bass calls a "near total abandonment of for-profit industry and 
locally-based financial institutions." Schiavone experienced this 
process first-hand as his partner, First Constitution Bank, struggled, 
and the market tightened. "In the mid-'8os, there were tremendous 
changes in the city administration ... there was general agreement 
among local developers that the administration ostracized the local 
private sector. There is no business left in New Haven." The city's 
economic distress made it clear that the development establishment 
had failed to stave off the onslaught of urban blight and, in the end, 
had collapsed on itself 

FoR ALDERMAN AND YALE graduate Julio Gonzalez, Yale's rise to 
preeminence ultimately depended on the decline of New Haven 
ourside the university. "Yale's growth is only noticeable in the vacu-
um of other private-sector leadership." While Yale may not have 
sought the power it has now acquired, this alone does not exoner-
ate the university's past role. Wolff condemns the university-devel-
oper-city relationship as a self-sustaining system, a cabal that has 
benefited each of irs members while doing little for New Haven. 
"We have thirty-five years of a partnership between Yale University, 
the city of New Haven, the federal government and private devel-
opers. My conclusion is that they should all be arrested for what 
17 


they did because the resulcs a.re terrible," 
accuses Wolff. The developers do not 
escape his blame, but as individual busi-
nessmen, they are not his prime target. 
"This is a city whose economic develop-
ment is an unmirigated disaster. And in 
that disaster, Schiavone, and a whole bunch 
of others-he's in no way particularly to 
blame--they just cashed in." 

In Wolff's eyes, New Haven has cycled 
through the same series of unsuccessful 
redevelopment techniques with every new 
city administration for the past thirty years, 
and each time, the city's economic and 
social problems have only been exacerbat-
ed. Though the Chapel Square mall has 
been refinanced multiple times and at great 
expense, its two anchor department 
stores-Malley's and Macy's-both col-
lapsed over a decade ago and much of the 
retail space in the downtown mall lies 
vacant. The suburban shoppers who the 
city expected co flow in on 1-95 and 1-91 
never came; they constructed their own 
malls and avoided New Haven altogether. 

In addition to redevelopment strate-
gies doomed to fail, Wolff poincs to the 
university's tax exemption on nearly all of 
ics property as one of the city's central 
problems, a view shared by Paul Bass. In 
the mid-198os, Wolff estimated what Yale 
would owe in property taxes if it paid the 
same tax rate as the average family living in 
the poverty-stricken Dixwell neighbor-
hood. Basing his research on the universi-
ty's own statementS of ics property value 
published in the annual financial report, 
Wolff concluded that Yale would have 
owed the city about $80 million a year-
the university was paying $4 million at the 
time. Though the state's Payment in Lieu 
ofT axes (PILOT) program partially compen-
sates for this, it does not nearly close the 
gap. This past year, New Haven received 
under $20 million from PILOT, less than a 
quarter of Wolff's estimate. This loss of tax 
revenue gains more and more significance 
as the university gees richer and New 
Haven's economy gees steadily worse. For 
Wolff and many New Haven residents, the 
dispariry is unconscionable. "They were 
not prepared to take any of the steps and, 
above all, to make any of the necessary 
expenditures to make a serious assault on 
poverty," he charges. 

While Schiavone's criticisms of Yale 
differ markedly from Wolff's, he agrees that 
Schfavone: New Haven politicians -should 
be in Yale"s pocket. There·s nobody else: 
the increasing economic divide between 
the university and the city is deeply trou-
bling: "Yale is the only major university in 
the United States that has not had a 
significant impact on itS city, and the gap is 
widening." 

Schiavone 
describes 
an 
entrenched isolationism on the parr of the 
university. In his days as a major developer, 
Schiavone was one of the university's most 
vocal critics. "They were isolated on all 
four sides," he recalls. City Planner Karyn 
Gilvarg confirms that this "perception of 
Yale as a 500-pound sleeping gorilla" was 
widespread. Schiavone goes further, charg-
ing that Yale exhibited an overt unwilling-
ness to invest in New Haven, instead 
engaging in what Paul Bass refers co as 
"head-in-the-sand, moat capitalism." In 
the face of the university's apparent reluc-
tance to proactively address the city's eco-
nomic problems, New Haven languished, 
and blame fell on Yale. 

However, attempts by Yale co ease rela-
~ions with the city, such as the creation of 
the Office of New Haven Affairs and 
University Properties, have improved com-
munications. The inception of the Yale 
Homebuyers' Program, and more contro-
versially, the redevelopment of Broadway 
and the purchase of the Chapel Street 
shops exemplify the style of city involve-
ment the university has recently embraced. 
"Now Yale has tried to be a constructive 
player in renewal. That's neither morally 
laudable nor venal; it's a business decision 
good for ics bottom line and at times good 
for New Haven, too," says Bass. 

Yale's Office of New Haven and State 
Affairs, headed by former Baltimore devel-
oper Bruce Alexander, has no trouble. com-
piling accolades and statistics to attest t"O ics 
positive role in community development. 
The university has received national atten-
tion from President Clinton for ics literacy 
programs and 
H U D 
Secretary Henry 
Cisneros for establishing community part-
nerships. The Yale Homebuyers' Program 
has helped almost 400 local residentS pur-
chase homes. "There are few universities 
who have committed themselves as vigor-
ously as Yale to long-term, comprehensive 
institutional partnerships for community 
development," says Michael Morand, an 
Assistant Vice-President in the Office of 
New Haven Affairs. 

Yale and the city's model for New 
Haven redevelopment in recent years has 
been mostly incremental in ics approach, 
bringing in businesses one by one and peri-
odically renovating buildings. Though 
New Haven's economic distress is acute, 
Karyn Gilvarg claims that Yale and the city 
are "constantly chipping away at it." Many 
local residentS and business owners are 
satisfied with this development tactic and
