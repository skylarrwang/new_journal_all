N A PHOTOGRAPH from the November 18, 
1996, issue of Th~ N~w York Tim~s, a 
young. war-worn Rwandan woman sits 
languidly in a chair as she receives a trans-
fusion of her mother's blood. Her mother 
stands beside her, holding a bag of saline 
solution connected to a needle in her 
daughter's arm. A tube hangs loosely from 
the bag, drooping down towards the 
ground and then sweeping up to the girl's 
arm, forming a curve which mathemati-
cians call a catenary (think Nike swoosh). 
The women and the catenary stand in con-
trast to the inchoate background of the 
decrepit third-world hospital. 

We would like to forget such an 
image: its perverse beauty jostles us out of 
our perceived security and reminds us of 
the fragility of human life. This photo-
graph, ranered and yellowing, hangs on the 
wall of Jasper Johns's studio and inspired 
the 13 paintings and works on paper now 
on exhibit at the Yale University Art 
Gallery. The works traverse difficult the-
matic terrain, exploring the dualities of 
childhood and adulthood, life and death, 
tragedy and comedy. The catenary curve 
emerge~ as the hero of the exhibit, provid-
ing the connection necessary to respond to 
the modern crises of misperception and 
distancing that pervade the exhibit. 

The exhibit continues Johns's artistic 
trajectory. His earliest work was inhabited 
by familiar public images-Bags and tar-
gets, namely-and was characterized by an 
almost complete lack of emotions. While 
he challenged his viewers' perceptions and 
visual and cerebral acuity, Johns offered lit-
tle of himself But he has become increas-
ingly present in his work, investing it with 
more emotional and personal references. 
This exhibition, which dramatically con-
fronts questions of utmost personal impor-
tance as well as those of critical artistic 
value, joins these two facets of his artistry. 

Johns's abstract imagery can be alien-
ating and daunting to all but the most sea-
soned modern art observers. I have never 
been one for senseless hues and splattered 
cans of paint, so I approached this exhibit 
with a healthy amount of skepticism. 
Could srrings and canvases doused indis-
criminately with paint mean anything to 
me? Could they affect me in the same way 
a Courbet portrait could? Without the 
imagery of the photograph that I carried 
with me throughout my five visits to the 
exhibit, probably not. But bearing that in 
mind-and we must, since Johns himself 
did-the exhibit rruly is a beautiful, elo-
quent commentary, its simple and austere 
beauty akin to a Neruda poem. One must 
delve into the spaces of the paintings and 
seek connections between their disparate 
elements in order to garner some meaning. 

What is perhaps most striking about 
the works is the unity of their imagery. A 
white suing hanging from one side of the 
frame to the other-a catenary-and the 
dense, murky background in various shades 
of gray persist throughout the series, as do 
variations on a small number of other 
images: the Big Dipper, the Milky Way, 
carved writings, and patterns from harle--
quin costumes. Each presents its own para-
dox or problem of perception which the 
viewer is forced to reconcile. 

Consider, for example, Johns's use of 
the Milky Way and the Big Dipper. 
Though the celestial images are present in 
several of the works, each rendering is dif-
ferent. Johns's depictions of the Milky Way 
range from a Seurat-like mass of dots in the 
formation of the galaxy to a much more 
defined structure resembling a blender 
blade. Similarly, the renderings of the con-
stellation range from thin, painted white 
lines connected to yellow dot stars, ro 
deeply incised lines separated by a small 
space from the carved yellow docs. Such a 
variety conuibutes to the spectrum of dis-
tance and connection that pervades the 
exhibit. It seems that Johns also uses this 
opportunity to expound upon the uses and 
limitations of human perception. The 
appearance of the galaxy is a natural phe-
nomenon made possible by gravity, where-
as the constellation is a human construe路 
tion, an example of humans inventing 
sense and connection where nature has 
provided none. While the galaxy reminds 
humans how small and inconsequential 路we 
are in the vast expanse of nature, the con路 
stellacion provides us with some security. 
we can understand and harness the power 
of nature for our own psychic benefit. But 
this security is problematic: one depiction 
of the constellation shows rwo different 
placements of the路scars in the night sky. 
separated by one hour's celestial move-
ment. Understand the phenomenon, we 
may; control it, we cannot. 

Another problematic image is the har-
lequin, who in his august b:iffoonery repre-
sents the perfect marriage of comedy and 
tragedy. Though he provides entertainment 
and enjoyment, he also represents the 
reduction of all human desires and emo-
tions from the sublime to the ridiculous. 
We laugh at him because we see ourselves 
in him. Artists ranging from Toulouse-
Lautrec to Picasso and, now, to Johns, have 
used the harlequin for his complex psycho-
logical associations and for the inevitable 
connection to childhood that his presence 
precipitates. Though Johns represents the 
harlequins meconymically in this series of 
works, using only the argyle pattern of 
their costumes, such familiar imagery is 
sufficient co conjure the tragicomic cha.rac-
ter of the harlequin and the simultaneous 
lightness and gravity he represents. The 
harlequin, his apparent lightness, and 
youth are all bound up in the pattern of 
diamonds that lines the right side of sever-
al of the paintings. In "Bridge," the center-
piece of the exhibit, this section of the 
frame fades quickly into a- dark gray back-
ground which takes up the rest of the 
painting: only the catenary bridges the 
great chasm of the tableau and, perhaps, 
the gap between the lightness and child-
hood that the harlequin represents, and 
their murky opposites. As in all the works, 
the catenary on this frame immediately 
recalls the catenary in the photograph. The 
implicit commentary on the fragility of the 
connection between youth and the great 
expanse beyond it is truly powerful. 

While the harlequin represents figura-
tively the opposition between lightness and 
gravity, the catenary physically embodies 
these principles. Various fasteners are fixed 
to either side of the frame, with the fasten-
er on the right side much higher than the 
one on the left. A thick white string hangs 
between the two fasteners, swooping down 
from right to left until it reaches a nadir 
and swoops up again towards the fastener 
on the left, mimicking the shape of the rv 
tube shared by the two Rwandan women in 
the photograph. In much the same way 
that the harlequin must concede some of 
his emotional autonomy to the forces of 
tragedy and despair, gravity takes over the 
catenary and determines the shape of its 
trajectory. Though Johns determines where 
the fasteners lie on the frame and how long 
the string is, gravity creates the catenary. 
The presence of the catenary demands a 
meditation on the differences between 
nature and human powers of creation. 

Both .the catenary and the constellation 
represent the happy marriage of nature and 
creativity, requiring the powers of both for 
their existence and comprehensibility. 
Johns challenges the viewer to question 
what is created and what is natural, and 
whether or not the difference matters. 

I don't think Johns himself knows the 
answer to that question. The exhibit is 
playful and challenging, but fundamentally 
frustrating. It is easy co look at this exhibit 
and see nothing but variations on a collec-
tion of abstract forms and hues of gray. It 
takes a great deal of investigation and pro-
cessing to make any sense of the works, and 
after five viewings I'm not sure that I am 
any further along than I was at the first. 
Have I fallen into the trap of art criticism 
and found meaning where there is none? 
Johns makes such a mistake as difficult as 
possible to commit. Even the seemingly 
empty spaces of the canvas are rife with 
detail and vibrancy: the gray backgrounds, 
while simple and uniform from afar, are in 
fact complex mixes of various shades and 
textures. So I have faith in Johns and in his 
hero, the catenary, to rescue me from my 
tentativeness. The catenary is truly heroic 
in its elegance and simplicity. It makes 
sense of the world it traverses, connecting 
disparate elements-tempestuous celestial 
bodies, images of childhood-along an axis 
that is consistent and stable. The difficul-
ties of this collection are nothing in com-
parison to the statement it makes regarding 
the nature and importance of connection, 
in the word's most broadly conceived 
meaning. Plod through the dense imagery, 
the inscrutability of this exhibit, and con-
nect.
