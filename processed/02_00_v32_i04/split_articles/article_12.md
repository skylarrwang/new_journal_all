Whitlock's Typewriter Shop occupies a single room. 
Shelves of antique, manual, and electric typing machines 
line every wall, and the room is saturated with a 
musty, industrial smell. 

From the entrance to the only 
window, rows of typewriters, standing on their sides and 
waiting to be sold, line a narrow path. 
An 1896 
antique machine, sent by a collector in New York, sits 
atop a tilted stand near Manson Whitlock's desk, as an 
ailing monstrous IBM Selectric goes under the knife . 

To the right of the window is a bookcase brimming with 
.anuals and collector's guides, and to the left are 
tiny holsters for tools and boxes of spare parts. 

Totally quiet and detached from the bustling traffic and 
construction along York Street, the shop seems more like 
a museum than a business. 

But Manson Whitlock is cer~ 
tainly busy enough. 
ui've got so many machines to work 
on--behind schedule!" 

It's easy to fall in love witb these beautifully 
anachronistic machines. 
Typewriters possess a refresh-
ing authenticity, a kind of austerity that computers 
altogether lack. 

Today, words are "processed," and the 
writer's actions are intermediated by monitors and key-
boards and printers. 
The first time I can see my actual 
words is after waiting for the document to spool, what-
ever that means. 

Computers, by some mystically fickle 
electronic force, gobble up essays ten minutes before 
the deadline. 
Files corrupt and printers jam. 

The typewriter, however, gives immediate gratification 
and tangible reward. 
The paper is before me, and the 
words are fixed in space right in front of my eyes. 
There is no delay between composition and the printed 
word. 

Of course, typing machines are not as neat and 
ordered as computers. 
They smudge. 
They require per-
fect typing skills and strong shoulders. 
But on the 
same coin, typewriters, in their rigid elegance, don't 
allow for the big mistakes, the errors that destroy 
whole works. 

Many times I have wished that I had writ-
ten papers with my slim and trusty Royalite 300, itself 
purchased from Whitlock's. 
There is a kind of nostal-
gia that accompanies typewriters, a return to beautiful-
ly original ways of putting words on a page. 
"I myself 
still like the old manual machines, " Whitlock agrees., 
"They're what I grew up with." Even as I purchased my 
macbine from him, Whitlock displayed some of the old 
cb*l:a that comes with typewriters.
