**Title: Goldman Sachs and the Non-Profit Recruiting Game**
**Author: John Swansburg**

OLDMAN SACHS HAS 
FOURTEEN BusiNESs PRINCIPLES. 
Principle Number 2 reads, "Our assets are our people, capital, 
reputation." At Goldman Sachs people clearly come first. 
Recruiting, therefore, has its own principle, Principle Number 6: 
"We make an unusual effort to identify and recruit the very best 
person for every job. Although our activities are measured in bil-
lions of dollars, we select our people one by one." 

At universities across the country, this effort takes the form of 
elaborate recruiting campaigns. Investment banking firms like 
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley Dean Winer take out full-
page ads in school newspapers; they take prospective employees out
to dinner. Of course, if your company's activities 
are measured in billions of dollars, it will attract 
attention with or without an unusual effort. 

While some job-seeking, soon-to-be college grads 
may be attracted to Goldman Sachs's assertion 
that "integrity and honesty are at the heart of our 
business" (Principle 14), most are more likely 
interested in the salaries and the signing bonuses. 

How do non-profit 
organizations. which 
have neither the 
money to attract 
attention nor the 
allure of big salaries. 
go about recruiting?

reminding his audience that not all non-profit work is hands-on 
community service. "Like corporations," he said, "we have bud-
gets." In the world of budgets, however, size matters, and he quick-
ly moved from compare to contrast, admiring, "We can't keep you 
because we can pay you a lot of money." What non-profit work can 
offer you, said Colavito, are the intangible rewards of working for 
change. But, he stressed, that work can be just as mundane as 
crunching numbers for ING Bearings-and it doesn't pay nearly as 
well. Was this the non-profit sales pitch? 

The comparisons to the corporate world continued. 
Throughout his speech he was wary of setting up the typical oppo-
sition between analyst and activist. He was eager, for 
instance, to discard the stereotype of the jolly non-
profit worker: "Our work affects people's lives. But 
that doesn't mean everyone has a good personality. 
Expect to meet all sorts of folks today-not everyone 
is super-nice." 

But how do non-profit organizations, which 
have neither the money to attract attention nor 
the allure of big salaries, go about recruiting? The 
Public Interest Career Fair seemed like a good 
place to find an answer. For the past two years the fair has been 
housed in Dwight Hall, with most of the over 30 organizations 
crammed into the hall's chapel. By noon, organizations with names 
like Emergency Shelter Management Services and the Young Adult 
Institute were preparing to preach the grass-roots gospel from the 
chapel's apse; Urban Resources Initiative and E, the Environmental 
Magazine, were setting up shop in the nave. 

The festivities began a little after one o'clock with a brief intro-
ductory speech, entitled "Job Search Tips," given by Yale grad Peter 
Colavito. Colavito is currently the Political Director for the 
Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now 
(ACORN). In 1998, 17 percent of Yale's graduating students pursued 
jobs in business and finance. But Colavito had the ear of over a 
hundred Yale students. Here was a chance to make the case for non-
profit over profit, to champion a career in public service over a 
career in self-service. 

Colavito, however, took quite a different tack. He opened his 
talk by comparing non-profit organizations to corporations, 
Colavito's curt tone seemed to stand as proof of 
his closing comment. The students who had assembled to hear his opening remarks appeared a bit bewildered. For one, the majority of the students present 
looked as if they had dressed to farm, nor to kill. The 
sartorial sensibilities of the recruiters were far more 
diverse. As the fair opened in earnest and the recruiters took their 
places behind their booths, the connection Colavito had drawn 
between corporations and non-profits was visibly apparent in the 
recruiters' clothing. Several suits stood interspersed between 
sweaters and scarves. Despite his rhetoric, Colavito himself looked 
the activist part, his wiry frame outfitted in an evergreen flannel 
shirt, jeans and sneakers, his dark brown eyes staring out of a dark 
brown, well-trimmed beard. The nearby Teach For America rep, on 
the other hand, looked like he had just stepped out of the Merrill 
Lynch web site. 

If the students were at first flustered by Colavito's words, they 
quickly adapted. Within minutes of the fair's opening, nearly every 
recruiter had a prospective employee to entertain. A number of 
brave souls moved directly to the ACORN booth to gather information. One student remarked that he enjoyed Colavito's speech. "I 
hope I didn't scare you away," retorted Colavito, apparently aware 
of the uninviting timbre of his words. "What is a typical day like for 
an ACORN organizer?" another student asked. "Very long," he 


replied, and launched into a description of 
the rigorous application process. He 
defined the ideal ACORN organizer as someone who fixes the copy machine when it 
breaks, not someone who calls maintenance for more toner. "We don't want any 
prima donnas," he declared. Were it not for 
his outfit, Colavito could have been a 
Smith Barney rep, on the verge of asking an 
interviewee how much a 747 weighs. 

But not everyone was as gruff as 
Colavito. Throughout the over-three-hour 
event, one of the most popular booths 
belonged to Green Corps, an agency that 
"strives to solve threats facing the planet." 
Representing Green Corps was Bernadette 
Del Chiaro, a young, energetic, super-nice 
woman. She differed in demeanor from 
Colavito, but she echoed his corporate 
comparisons. She spoke of the long hours 
non-profit work demands, comparing it to 
the long hours of investment bankers. Again the difference was the compensation: applicants 
to the Green Corps compete for a shot at a 
slim $17,500 a year. Del Chiaro herself was 
recruiting all day in Dwight Hall pro bono. 
But Green Corps' net gain was considerable: in under an hour Del Chiaro had 
acquired the names and addresses of over 
20 interested students. Green Corps only 
hires 25 employees annually. Four hundred 
apply. Competition is even stiffer for other 
programs. The Peace Corps representative 
(suit) amiably distributed applications and 
free highlighters to droves of students all 
afternoon, but with a practiced frown she 
informed seniors that if they wanted to join 
the Peace Corps next September they 
should have started applying this past 
September, the same month Goldman 
Sachs first came to New Haven. 

So what is the allure? Public interest 
work is rewarding-for romantics and real-
ists alike. A program like Teach for America 
appeals to students who want to save the 
world, offering the opportunity to work in 
some of the toughest schools in the country, to work toward progress one classroom 
at a time. The Connecticut Department of 
Corrections, on the other hand, appeals 
more to the practical mind. Many of the 
volunteers at Connecticut Corrections are 
law students trying to gain valuable experience working with juvenile offenders. 

There was an organization for every cause 
at the fair. Interested students could find 
out how to help fight homelessness, hunger 
and everything in between. A tangible 
reward gained working behind a desk is 
faceless-unless you count Ben Franklin's 
countenance. An intangible one, it seemed, 
may have any number of faces. 

The Public Interest Career Fair pulled 
in over 130 students this year. It seems that 
despite the recent barrage of tantalizing 
success stories of IPOs on NASDAQ, there are 
still plenty of young people who would 
prefer a career fighting DDT through 
ACORN. Non-profits may not be able to 
foot the bill for full-page ads, but due to 
the interest in their causes, they can afford 
to tell it like it is, to talk about long hours 
and low wages. Is this an unusual way to 
recruit? Peter Colavito would say it is just a 
cost-effective way to identify and recruit 
the very best person for every job.
