Mississippi Burning 
How a Herald Op-ed Sparked a 
Flame-"War Between the States 
by Daniel Brook 
BACK IN THE 1960s, COLLEGE-AGED 'YANKEES had to pile into sta-
tion-wagons and drive South to effect social change. It was tough 
work. Civil-rights workers were routinely harassed and sometimes 
even killed. Luckily for today's Ivy League liberals, modern Internet 
technology has made all that messy person-to-person contact a 
thing of the past. Thanks to U-Wire, a Chicago-based internet 
company that collects and distributes articles from over 200 sub-
scribing student periodicals, long-distance agitation has never been 
easier. Just publish a few well-worded anacks in your college paper 
and let U-Wire do the rest. 

In his October 29 "Whiskey and Rye" column in the Yak 
Hn-ald, junior John Schochet argued that the South "acts like a 
spoiled child" by preserving "treasonous" symbols of the 
Confederacy. In addition, Schochet criticized the region for 
"revel[ing] in its racist, violent, primitive, and intolerant past." Like 
any decent student column, it made good points but often rode that 
fine line between hyperbole and insanity, saying things like, 
"Virginia and Alabama owe humanity an apology [for honoring 
Robert E. Lee and 'Stonewall' Jackson]." The column provoked a 
number of leners to the editor, and to Schocher himself. most of 
which rode that same line. One e-mail consisted of the words "Eat 
my load" wrinen over and over and was meant, according to the 
author, to be sung "to the rune of'Ode to Joy."' 

But the real fun started a week later. 

Unbeknownst to Scbochet, the newspaper editors at 
the University of Southern Mississippi picked up his 
column from U-Wire. Schacher's op-ed ran in the 
November 4 issue of usM's The Studmt Printz, 
attracting a second wave of leners. One letter was 
selected by the Printz to run in its November 9 ~ 
issue. "I recall a certain President that was from the ._..-
: 
state of Massachusetts that almost put this country 
· 
in another economic depression," the lener said. "In 
contrast, our friend from Arkansas has 
not only brought prosperity and peace, 
but he has done it with southern style 
and pinash [sic] that northerners only 
George Bush famously claimed three home states but Massachusetts 
wasn't one of them. And as for Clinton, I think we'd all be much 
happier if he kept his southern "pinash" in his pants. 

But if students were having this much trouble simply keeping 
the facts straight and the spelling correct, the older generation was 
completely at sea with the newfangled U-Wire technology. One 
Printz.. reading USM alum pegged Schochet for a srudent at Southern 
Mississippi rather than a vicious outside agitator (a Jew from the 
Bay Area, no less). "I am sincerely disappointed to find that a once 
fine Southern institution of higher learning has become a Politically 
Correct 'South Basher,"' the letter fumed. "At one time, I believed 
that Southern Miss was the finest university in the South and had 
encouraged my child to attend classes at your school. However, 
after seeing the tripe you have seen fit to publish, I have decided 
that my child will not even bother to apply there." 

Ultimately, the very fundamentals of human communication 
seemed to be breaking down on the shoulder of the information 
superhighway. Schochet especially enjoyed an e-mail from "a guy 
who talked about how he was a veteran and how obviously I had 
never served in the military and wasn't a real American like him. He 
addressed the column 'Dear Mr. Schocher' but then started address-
read about." Sadly, the last president

from Massachusetts was Kennedy;

let's face it, if we're not going to rise 
above trading insults, who needs 
an electronic intermediary like e-
mail? Telling someone to "Eat my 
load" in person beats telling them 
via e-mail.
