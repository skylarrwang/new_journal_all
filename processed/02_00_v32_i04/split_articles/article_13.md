**Title: The Typewriter Repairman**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Manson Whitlock started working on typewriters in 1934 when his family owned 
Whitlock's Bookstore, a pre-war version of Barnes and Noble--it sold sandwiches and 
coffee, books and records. 

The family-run business, which took up most of a whole 
block along Broadway during the 1930s, later moved to a smaller one-story location 
on York Street. 

Whitlock then moved in 1991 to the current one-room space above 
Willoughby's at 282 York. 

But through all the moves and changes, he stays in busi-
ness with a sense of devotion. 
"I feel an obligation to help the old customers who 
can't find anyone to fix their old machines. 
I sell them for about a tenth of their 
worth." He sells and repairs these old and beautiful machines simply because he 
loves them, and he thinks others deserve to have these great typewriters, too. 
Whitlock certainly puts out a quality product . 
David Bromwich, a Yale English 
professor, bought an old Royal Standard from Whitlock's in 1969 for $50 . 
Nit has 
used dozens of ribbons since then, but has never needed a repair," Bromwich said. 


"A solid industrial object, and when you have finished using it, you have had a 
workout, but your eyes are not glazed over, your brain is not torpid, and your mor-
tal being has not been blasted one inch closer to eternity by a trillion computer 
death rays. 

All in all, a very good bargain." Whitlock, too, sees typewriters as 
filling a contemporary need. 
"For example, it's even easier to address an envelope 
than to turn on your computer. " As for those who complain about the noise which 
typewriters make, "People! We used to put up with all that without the squawking." 
For Whitlock, his shop is nothing special: "I'm not sure if I'm a curious 
antique or an antique curiosity. " He just repairs and sells typewriters. 
While I 
was talking with him, Whitlock answered a house-call from a customer. 
"That was 
some old lady who can't climb stairs anymore. 
She asked me if I could come by and 
replace an old ribbon in her machine for her--that's why I still work with these 
machines." 


**Title: The End of the MP3 Party?**
**Page number(s): 12**

T: YOU CAN READ THIS, you probably know what an MP3 is and 
.L: how co get one. These free, tradable, shareable music files are 
becoming as ubiquitous on Yale computers as Solitaire. Our ultra-
fast Ethernet connections are perfectly suited co both MP3 transmjs-
sion and distribution. But for some Yale stud!!nts, MP3S are more 
than a diversion; they're an opportunity to contribute to a commu-
nity of music fans, and a fast moneymaker as well. So what happens 
when an underground technology becomes popular and accessible, 
providing free entertainment co many and tangible rewards co a 
few? You guessed it-the party's almost over. 

Daniel Folkinshteyn, a sophomore in JE, set up his MP3 server 
this fall "just to see if I could do ic." He downloaded free software 
from the Internet that transformed his computer into a web server, 
making the MP3 files he downloaded or ripped from cos available to 
anyone on the Internet. Yale's multi-user network makes this rela-
tively easy. 

Dan led me proudly to my Compaq Presario to show the evi-
dence of his work. Disdaining the mouse, he called up 
graph.net.yak.edu with a few keystrokes. This showed Yale's incom-
ing-outgoing web traffic, broken down by residence hall and into 
daily, monthly, and yearly averages. The average load for Jonathan 
Edwards College is about 200 kilobics per second (kb/s). "But," he 
said, "you will see a nke little spike in September"- a staggering 
average load of 5,000 kb/s- for the three weeks Folkinshceyn's site 
was running at its peak. 

What made Folkinshceyn's site so popular? Volume and selec-
tion. "When I first got my computer, it had 4 gigabytes of [hard 
disk space] and I was like, what am I going to do with all this?" he 
said. "Now I have 18, and II of ic is taken up with MP3s." That put 
more than 2 ,000 songs on his site. How did he choose them? "I 
asked some people what kind of music was popular, and then I 
would downloatl that. I don't even remember the names because a 
lot of it I'd never heard of." Since arriving in this country from 
Moscow five years ago, Folkinshteyn's own taste in music has tend-
ed toward Metallica. His site also included every episode of South 
Park i.o Real Video. 

This traffic brought Folkinshteyn more than personal satisfac-
tion. He set up an advertising banner program on his site with 
instructions asking people co click on the banner in order to gee the 
free music. Banner companies pay site operators a few cents per 
click. This. earned him almost $400 in about three weeks. "I guess 
if you count the total time I cook to set it up, ic comes co less chan 
minimum wage," he said. 

But once the site was running, it would have kept earning 
money with little or no support, were it not for the long arm of 
Yale's Information Technology Services (ITS) . "One day I came 
home from classes and found that I didn't have access co the 
Internee anymore and they had blocked all packets having co do 
with my IP [Internee Protocol] address, both source and destination. 
I started composing an e-mail asking what was going on, but my e-
mail wasn't working either." (The IP address is an identification 
number for each computer on the network.) Folkinshteyn ended up 
in a meeting with the head of ITS, Daniel Updegrove, and promised 
co take down his site. That was it-no sanctions, no threacs. 

How did ITS catch Folkinshteyn, and what was he doing 
wrong? The first question is easy to answer: "We monjcor the nee-
work, not for content, but like a traffic councer on Whitney 
Avenue. Basically we look for an unusual amount of traffic," 
Updegrove said. "That's our clue that someone's been doing some-
thing nasty." No doubt, ic was the sharp spike in JE's traffic for
