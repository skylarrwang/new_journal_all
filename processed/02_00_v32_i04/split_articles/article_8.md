Elective Affinities 
Female politician: the words quickly con-
jure images of Hillary Clinton and 
Elizabeth Dole, women in the national 
spodight seen as riding not only on their 
own qualifications but also on their hus-
bands' coattails. Most women entering pol-
itics, however, do not have husbands sitting 
in the Oval Office or Capitol, nor do they 
launch their careers with bids for senator or 
president. The real story of women in pol-
itics reveals female protagonists acting in a 
largely local arena. But the problems faced 
by Clinton and Dole in their respective 
elections-criticism of appearance and per-
sonality and difficulties in fundraising in 
particular-are common to all female 
politicians. 

What, then, is a woman entering poli-
tics without Washington connections to 
do? She can attempt to raise money, build 
coalitions, and combat the old boys' net-
work and a biased media singlehandedly, or 
she can turn to the Women's Campaign 
School (wcs) at Yale University to learn the 
latest in campaign techniques, fundraising, 
public speaking and media relations. 

Andree Brooks, a former journalist 
and county official in England, founded 
the wcs in November, 1993, hoping to pro-
vide accessible and reliable training for 
women seeking to enter politics. The 
women's movement had offered political 
training for many years, but, according to 
Brooks, "Women could only find it if they 
were already in politics." A fellow of 
Jonathan Edwards College, Brooks hoped 
to use her Yale connection to anchor train-
ing at a well-known university, whose name 
would attract students internationally. 

She has largely succeeded. For the past 
eight years, the wcs, which is co-sponsored 
by the Yale Law School and the Women's 
and Gender Studies Program, has offered 
an annual four-and-a-half-day comprehen-
sive training session for 40 students, and in 
1996 expanded its program to include sev-
eral one-day workshops. At all sessions, 
women, as well as men who plan to run 
women's campaigns, receive hands-on 
tratmng in campaign skills. They learn 
from experienced politicians, who have 
included New Jersey Governor Christine 
Todd 
Whitman 
and 
Connecticut 
Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, and cake 
part in mock campaigns, case studies, and 
lobbying sessions. Students not only gain 
concrete skills, but also build confidence 
and coalitions, and it is this trio, rather 
than any single benefit, that Brooks cele-
brates as the school's greatest contribution. 

Brooks has good reason to herald the wcs's 
achievements. In recent municipal elec-
tions, So percent of wcs graduates who ran 
won their races, and the program boasts 
not only successful American alumnae, but 
also alumnae from Haiti, Indonesia, and 
Kenya. 

But the successes of the wcs have not 
come without a struggle. "It's been an 
uphill batde," says Brooks. Ironically, the 
challenges the wcs faces reflect the very 
obstacles the school teaches female candi-
dates to overcome. Women in politics 
encounter greater obstacles than their male 
counterparts in raising money and gaining 
access to publicity. Furthermore, media 
presentation is often biased. Women 
receive more coverage of personal charac-
teristics, such as appearance, marital status, 
and personality, and less coverage of their 
positions on issues. There is a definite dou-
ble standard operating on the political 
playing field. As Brooks says, "A woman 
has to prove herself; a man's competence is 
assumed. Whereas a woman will be criti-
cized for her looks or clothing. a man can 
get away with sloppy clothes and a raspy 
voice." 

While the wcs helps women overcome 
obstacles regarding fundraising and media 
coverage, the school itself stumbles over 
these very hurdles. "We've existed hand to 
mouth from the beginning." says Brooks, 
who launched the school with no capital. 
Today, the wcs's fiscal resources remain 
limited, and the school has difficulty adver-
tising its services. A one-day conference 
scheduled for February 5 was rescheduled 
for April due to low enrollment, and 
although the wcs has attracted students of 
diverse backgrounds, ages, and nationali-
ties, most of its students come from 
Connecticut and a small cluster of sur-
rounding states. With a limited budget and 
â€¢ publicity resources, the wcs can only reach 
so far. 

The largely local success enjoyed by 
the wcs is perhaps one more reflection of 
the current situation of female politicians: 
women are making the greatest gains in 
local elections, while change is coming 
more slowly on the national front. Despite 
an all-rime high of 65 women in Congress, 
it is nonetheless the local scene in which 
"women have made huge inroads and 
changes," states Brooks, who warns against 
focusing solely on national politics. 

Although there are congresswomen among 
wcs alumnae, they are far outnumbered by 
women serving as selectwomen, presidents 
of boards of education, and city council 
members. In Connecticut at least, local 
gains have been significant-Connecticut 
ranks ninth in percentage of female state 
legislators, and at least one half of the state's 
executive posts are held by women. 

This does not mean, however, that 
female involvement in local politics is the 
primary goal of the wcs. Women who 
enter local politics are likely to trickle up to 
national positions; the wcs hopes to turn 
this trickle into a flood. Recendy, the wcs 
has set its sights on California and is offer-
ing a two-day conference in San Francisco 
this March. Perhaps, as the wcs reaches a 
hi-coastal audience, the school will realize 
even greater success in bolstering women's 
political achievements. In any case, the 
activities of the wcs both reflect and engen-
der an important sea change for the 
American political system.
