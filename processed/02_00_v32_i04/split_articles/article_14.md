September that attracted the eye of one of ITs's 325 employees, 
bringing Folkinshteyn's cottage industry to an end. 

The second question is a bit more complex. In his meeting 
with Folkinshteyn, Updegrove cited violations of several ITS 
"Appropriate Use" policies, most of which were formulated with the 
general good in mind. Most concretely, any "non-Yale commercial 
use" of ITS systems, such as a banner program on a web site, is pro-
hibited. A second section of the policy applicable to Folkinshteyn's 
case is a bit more abstract: "Users must not deny or interfere with 
or attempt to deny or interfere with service to other users by means 
of'resource hogging."' A site receiving twenty-five times the normal 
amount of traffic would seem to qualify. "It's like a highway," says 
Updegrove. "If there are too many cars on it, you'll go slower. We 
try to engineer the system with a reasonable amount of capacity for 
each user, but if someone's using too much, it just slows everyone 
else down." 

Had the university wished to press the issue, the question of 
good network citizenship would have been secondary. MP3 traders 
are Internet criminals. Under the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act, 
passed in 1997, the distribution (including electronic distribution) 
of copyrighted sound recording can be criminally prosecuted even 
if no one is earning a profit. This law closed a legal loophole: before 
1997, it was impossible to prosecute MP3 traders who were giving 
away their stolen merchandise. 

The NET Act was passed with heavy lobbying from the 
Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), the victim's 
voice in the "victimless crime" of MP3 trading. The RIAA, a nonprofit 
association representing major record labels, is running a one-enti-
ty crusade against illegal MP3s. Universities, with their fast networks 
and large number of bored smart kids, are a hotbed of such activi-
ties and a major focus of RIAA's campaign. As their web site 
(www.riaa.com) states, they provide a kit for university and college 
administrators which "serve[s] as a framework for discussion of 
music and the Internet. Its purpose is to raise awareness that repro-
ducing and distributing music illegally is akin to stealing, and such 
actions have serious ethical and legal consequences." 

But education is not the extent of the RIAA's efforts to secure 
justice. Just ask sophmore Jeremy Stacy, who may bear the distinc-
tion of being ITS's first bust. He had his MP3 site, Neuromancer's 
Pad, up within weeks of arriving at Yale. "Actually, my first day here, 
I talked to one of the ITS people and asked if it would be okay to 
run my own server off of Yale's," Stacy said. "He said it would be 
okay, so I thought I had clearance." Stacy's site was set up using a 
proprietary server software called Hotline, which he downloaded 
for free off the web. He describes the program as "basically like a 
newsgroup, AOL instant messenger, and FTP all in one." 

Neuromancer's Pad was a tribute to Stacy's love of industrial 
music-he also has an industrial show on WYBC. In addition to ille-
gal ripped or downloaded cracks, he had a good number of 
unsigned bands who made their music freely available in hopes of 
gaining recognition. "Originally, I was doing it because I was mak-
ing a few hundred dollars a week," Stacy said. "But then I took the 
banner programs off, because I could get more hits that way, and I 
didn't really need the money. I liked being somebody who organized 
a place for people to come on and get to know each other." On a 
couple of occasions, small record labels like Grimworks Records 
ended up signing bands they had first heard on Stacy's site. 

Before uploading a single song, Stacy sought assurance that all 
this activity was above-board. "It's nice to have the law on your 
side," he said. He had a lawyer draft an agreement which he
