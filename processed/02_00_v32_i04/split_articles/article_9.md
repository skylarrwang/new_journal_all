Coming from America 
Consider the following possibilities. You 
walk down a hallway and see a poster 
advertising the Partisan Review. Your fresh-
man counselor makes an offhand comment 
relating Hemingway's ''A Clean Well-
Lighted Place" and Hopper's "Nighthawks" 
when he sees a copy of the painting on your 
wall. Each weekend you can choose from 
several student productions, at least one of 
which is a dramatic "classic." The highlight 
of your Halloween is a performance by 
your school's undergraduate symphony 
orchestra. Sound familiar? 

Now pretend that you go to a public 
high school in a small town in southwest-
ern Ohio named after a much grander 
town in England. This high school wins 
national awards in vocational agriculture 
but doesn't offer more than one or two 
honors classes. Now populate that school 
with students ranging from professors' kids 
to members of the Future Farmers of 
America and Future Homemakers of 
America to pseudo-gang member, pseudo-
city kids. 

That school, Talawanda High School, 
was my high school, and from the perspec-
tive ofYale, it's a pretty strange place. But 
from the perspective of home, Yale is even 
stranger. Although my town is named 
Oxford after the college in England, and 
we have our own state universiry, Miami 
Universiry, to accompany that name, peo-
ple from Oxford just don't do things like go 
to Ivy League schools. 

The three guidance counselors my 
school employed told us about our post-
secondary options: we could enter the 
workforce or the military, go to a vocation-
al program, get a two year associate's 
degree, or, if we really, really, wanted to, 
attend a four-year college or universiry-
like Ol_tio State or Miami. Distant and 
prestigious schools like Yale were never 
mentioned in the little bit of advising that 
did exist, perhaps rightly so. After all, in a 
school where the only AP class offered, AP 
Literature, was dosed due to low enroll-
ment (five students), there were obviously 
fEBRUARY 11, 2000 
very few students looking at schools like 
Yale. I remember the lone meeting the 
school had for college-bound students. It 
was in the late fall of our senior year, about 
the time decisions had been made about 
where to apply and even the biggest slack-
ers had already sent in a few applications. 
We all gathered in the sweary gymnasium, 
hardly filling up the row of bleachers where 
we were sitting, while a financial aid officer 
from Miami tried to explain to us how 
financial aid works. Then she left, and we 
were told to return to our classes. End of 
discussion. 

To some Yale students these scenes 
might seem ludicrous, bur to my high 
school classmates it is the Partisan Review, 
"Nighthawks," and theater and orchestra 
concerts that are absurd. It is when Yale 
students take these details for granted that 
I am reminded of the true rift between this 
ivory tower and home. A poster in a hall-
way is like hotel art; it's something bland 
and innocuous that everyone accepts with-
out a question. Only at a universiry like 
Yale would the Partisan Review be deemed 
such a poster. 

It's these details we take for granted 
that make me feel like an interloper here. 
Aside from a few wry groans and sympa-
thizing grimaces, hardly anyone looks 
askance at a friend spending Saturday night 
studying in the library. Sure, Naples is 
always full on a Thursday night, but so are 
the college libraries-and they're full until 
a much later hour than Naples. Every so 
often I start to forget how peculiar this 
lifesryle is, how divorced from "real 
America." 

It's easy to get caught up in the whirl 
of protesting the Taliban, watching Fight 
Club afrer a question and answer session 
with Edward Norton, and having epipha-
nies about the Odyssry and Milan Kundera. 
It would be easy never to leave this lifestyle 
of assumptions, the implicit checklist in 
the back of every good Yalie's head: a qual-
icy pre-college education, Yale, profession-
allgraduate 
school, 
high-paying job, 
designer apartment in Â·"the City" or sprawl-
ing old farmhouse in the country. And it 
would be easy for me to start checking off 
that list myself. 

I'm not saying that my hometown is 
"real America." There are too many differ-
ences from place to place to designate any 
single town or region as "real." Even I'm 
not really a farm girl, though I went to a 
rural school district. My dad is a professor, 
my mom an engineer, and I took as many 
Miami classes as I could during high 
school. And hey-l'm a Yalie too.

Professor Kang-1 Sun Chang would like to 
make Handsome Dan a household name in 
China. The bulldog's history, along with 
fourteen other essays about Yale and its 
professors, are collected in her new book, 
Rejkctions on Yak, Gender and Culture. This 
compilation of articles, written in Chinese, 
is currently being printed in both Taiwan 
and mainland China. Chang expects her 
book to be a best-seller. 

In Taiwan, where most of these articles 
were published originally, the cult of Yale is 
already well established. Most Americans 
have probably never thought about the 
Universities of Taipei or Beijing. In Asia, 
however, there is a widespread fascination 
with Yale and Harvard, so much so that 
Chang uses Yale's name as a selling point 
when her articles are essentially about 
something else. Her essay on the Women's 
Table, for example, is in fact a case study in 
the growth of American co-education. 

Chang's articles about Yale have been well-
received: many have appeared in publica-
tions that she describes as analosues to the 
New l0rk Times or the New l0rk Review of 
Books. An article on President Levin was 
published in the Cmtrai Daily News's liter-
ary supplement. "Everybody in Taiwan 
reads the Cmtrai Daily News," says Chang.
