**Yale's Image in China**
**Author: Blair Wilson**
**Page number(s): 6**

Yale's image in the People's Republic of 
China is a little different. When Chang 
came to Yale's East Asian Literature faculty 
almost cwenty years ago, Harvard stood 
alone in the Chinese conscience as a sym-
bol of American educational excellence. 
Weakening the other school's iron grip has 
been part of her agenda all along. Chang 
considers herself a cultural ambassador and 
has consciously attempted to bolster Yale's 
reputation in China through her articles 
and books. She has written about Yale's his-
torical involvement with China; and 
Refoctions on Yale, Gmtkr and Cultur~, in a 
somewhat altered form, will appear as part 
of a series of books on great universities. 
Other books will include one on Harvard 
and another on the University of Beijing. 
(Princeton, it seems, still does not matter.) 

Chang's perspective on Yale might sur-
prise a typical undergraduate. As she 
describes it, Yale is every bit as idyllic and 
intellecrually free an institution as por-
trayed in the admissions catalog. Her opti-
mism is partially motivated by a desire to 
portray Yale in a good light-news of 
union trouble and New Haven crime does 
reach Taiwan-but it is fundamentally 
grounded in a very bright view of the 
school, its students, and irs faculty. Chang 
has made remarkable use of this place, and 
her list of friends is practically an all-star 
roster. She interviews professors here whose 
work interests her, and then passes on 
something from Levin's commencement 
speech, or a few of Vladimir Alexandrov's 
thoughts on Nabokov, to her Chinese read-
ers. In a country where intellectual freedom 
is not granted liberally, the Ivy League uni-
versity, with its mascots and traditions, is a 
powerful symbol of liberty and free 
thought. When we think of American cui-
cure and its popularity in other countries, 
we think more often of Madonna and Babe 
Ruth than of Jonathon Spence and Harold 
Blume. But Chang's book shows that there 
is a strong Chinese market for our ideas, 
and for the idea ofYale.

**Snow Falling on Elms**

Snow Falling on Elms 
According to Yale's admissions view-
book, the main task of the admissions com-
mittee is to answer cwo questions: "Who is 
likely to make the most ofYale's resources?" 
and "Who will contribute significandy to 
the Yale community?" One week ago, while 
walking around Yale, I came upon an 
astonishing scene showing just how badly 
the committee failed at this rask. 

I am walking back ro Old Campus 
after the Super Bowl, and ir is snowing. 
Not dry, annoying snow, but the good 
stuff: big. sticky flakes that fall fast and 
hard, s~ you can actually feel each one as it 
plops onto your shoulders. Snow like this 
cries for sleds, begs for snowmen, pleads to 
be balled up and thrown at people's heads. 
Snow like this leaves no excuse to be inside. 
As I see it, snow like this certainly qualifies 
as one of "Yale's resources." 

Yet Old Campus is painfully serene. 
Lights are on everywhere, but nobody 
is outside. Wonderful snow falls 
on deaf ground, ignored 
and left to suffer death-by-
sanding come dawn. Once 
in my room, I call a trust-
ed friend. "We have to go 
sledding now," I tell him. 
"It's perfect outside, better 
than it's ever been. There's 
a great hill behind the 
Divinity School." 

He doesn't even ask if I have a 
sled. (I don't. The closest I have is a card-
board sign, but I figure it will do.) Instead, 
he says, "Can't. I have chem." 

"Grear," I say. "When's it due?" 

"Tomorrow," he says. Anticipating my 
next question, he added, "In the morning." 

I try several other friends and both of 
my roommates, but everyone was hopeless-
ly indisposed: os reading, astronomy 
homework, Russian translation, Milron's 
poetry, a televised showing of &autician 
and th~ B~ast. 

Pathetic. By the standards of our own 
admissions committee, we don't deserve ro 
be here. One of the best Super Bowls in 
recent memory has just ended, and great 
snow is falling everywhere; there is no bet-
ter time to play snow foorball. And if foot-
ball isn't our thing, we can go sledding. 
have a snowball fight, build snow men or 
snow torso sculptures, like the one in rhe 
Davenport courtyard. But we aren't doing 
any of thar. What are we doing? We are 
reading. highlighting, crunching numbers. 

Never have I encountered a group so 
unwilling to contribute ro the Yale com-
munity, so unwilling to take advantage of 
its resources. 

It could have been a great night, one 
.that would live longer in memory than any 
problem set, bur nobody seemed to care. It 
was self-imposed prison, and everybody 
just wanted to be left alone until it seemed 
safe to be free. "Homework got us in here," 
the reasoning went, "so homework must be 
what can get us out." I grabbed my card-
board sign and headed for the Divinity 
School. 

What happens to us becween child-
hood and Yale? How does chem become 
more important than sledding? 

Priorities may change, but not 
to the point that working 
redox reactions seems like 
a better idea than playing 
in the snow. Perhaps we 
have grown roo mature ro 
play in the snow, too 
dignified ro have a slush 
ball shoved down the back 
of our neck. 

We don't have to go this 
way. After several runs down the Div 
School hill on my cardboard sign, a man 
and his dog arrive at the rop. The man pulls 
out a plastic garbage can lid, sets ir on the 
snow and sits down. "Look our," he yells, 
and pushes off. As he shoots past me, his 
dog racing after him, I wonder if he was 
like this 20 years ago, or if he was locked up 
in some library waiting for life to come in 
and whisper "Psst! Follow me." He reaches 
the bottom and begins playing wich rhe 
dog. and I realize that ir doesn't matter 
what he was like 20 years ago. What mat-
ters is that at some point he made a deci-
sion to be something. and became the per-
son he is now: a fortyish man who isn't 
afraid to sled on plastic garbage can lids 
and play in the snow with his dog ar mid-
night on a Sunday.
