EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Nearing Phelps Gate on the way back 
from sledding, I hear Old <3ampus before I 
see it: the place isn't just occupied, it's 
crowded. People are everywhere. Major 
wars are being fought in front of Farnam 
and Vanderbilt, as ground troops tackle 
each other amid heavy artillery fire. There 
are no snow torsos, but some of the snow-
men and snowwomen have been built with 
such precision that they are easily rold 
apart. 

A boy from my English class rushes up 
and says, "See that guy over there in the red 
coat? Let's get him." 
"Who is he?" I ask. 
"I don't know. That's why we're going 
to get him," he says, and we take off. We 
pause as two girls, the ones who couldn't go 
sledding earlier because they were reading 
Milton's poetry, run past us wearing noth-
ing at all. Then we sprint toward Red Coat, 
and throw him down tO the snow. As he 
lies on the ground, slush-covered and fresh-
ly tackled by two complete strangers, Red 
Coat just laughs. 

The clock says 12:45 but the sky is 
almost bright blue, as if light is already 
creeping up around the edges, or maybe it 
just never left completely in the first place. 
One of the M ilton girls has French at 8:30, 
but she's back outside in a sweatshirt, 
standing next to me as she yells and throws 
snowballs at a friend's dark window on the 
third floor. There is no reason, I realize, to 
be angry or bitter about the moment of 
hesitation before we pour out of our rooms 
and into the snow. Some of us are trying to 
â€¢ 
change our lives, "grow up" and wear pret-
ty shoes and an overcoat; some of us 
already are grown up, and have been for 
too long. All of us, however, have a choice, 
and if we heed grown men on trash can lids 
and girls trying to read Milton during per-
fect snows, we will make the right choice 
and see that in becoming adults we don't 
have to give up what made being ten years 
old so fi.in. Maybe the admissions commit-
tee wasn't so wrong about us after all: we 
were just a little slow out of the gate.
