Jon 
Katz 
Jon Katz is the author of eight books, including Running to the Mountain and 
Virtuous Reality, but is best known for his writings on media and technology. 
He has written for Wired, GQ, and 1be New lVrk Times and was twice 
nominated for the National Magazine Award for his articles in Rolling Stone. 
Katz also writes for Slashdot.org, Hotwired, and Free!, the Freedom Forum's 
website. His new book, Geeks: How Two Lost Boys Rode the Internet out of 
Idaho, is a remarkable true story of how technology can change lives. 
Geeks takes us into an increasingly powerful sub-culture with its own 
language, traditions and taboos, to a place where jesse Dailey and Eric 
1\vilegar altered their fates. In a story full of hope, we see how these two 
working<lass, rural teenagers with little support or resources used the Net 
to pull themselves up the economic ladder to a better job and a better place. 
As part of the Author Series at The Yale Bookstore, jon Katz will discuss and 
sign Geeks on Tuesday, February 22nd at~:30pm. All events are free and 
open to the public.
