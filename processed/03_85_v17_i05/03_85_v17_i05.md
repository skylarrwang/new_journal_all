**Title: 15 Years of Evolving Coeducation**
**Author: Tina Kelley**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
"So dear, how do you like being a woman at Yale?" He was 
kindly and concerned, this member of the Class of Long 
Ago. It would have been neither polite nor politic to ex-
plain how I considered myself a woman and a Yale student, 
but had only a vague idea of the Yale Woman and the in-
trinsic value of being one. A more pertinent question 
would have been, "So dear, do you feel discriminated 
against as a woman here?" 

No, I don't. In some ways I should, but I don't. I am get-
ting the same education as my male classmates. I use the 
same facilities. I speak as frequently in class. I go to the 
same university. I may be an exception, however. 

"I'm a woman who loves men, but to each his own." This 
appeared in pen on a freshly-painted wall in the women's 
room of Cross Campus Library. Someone has circled his. 
An arrow from the word leads to several question marks 
and exclamation points. The only sexual discrimination I 
sense is in such inaccurate figures of speech, which ex-
emplify Problems in Society. 

This may be because I am not an active supporter of 
many of the causes these writers on the wall express. U n-
fortunately, less than half the Yale population ever reads 
their freestyle words, ever looks at this blatantly honest and 
spontaneous demonstration of the issues concerning Yale 
women. 

Fifteen years ago, after more than ten years of debate, 
588 female undergraduates arrived in New Haven. The 
quality of life for women has improved greatly since then, 
from the pretty paint on Vanderbilt bathroom walls to the 
end of the quota for women students, from the founding of 
the Women's Studies Department five years ago to the 
clerical and technical workers' historic unionization. 

But in 1985 I still hear classmates described as "real 
finger-down-the-throat types;" I still hear complaints of 
sexism in the classroom. I have watched the scrawled words 
become increasingly adamant. And I recognize the futility 
of saying sexual discrimination is the world's, not the 
University's problem. 

In this issue of The Ntw journal we bring you the 
bathroom wall. First, the history of how Yale became not a 
brothel, not a week-long mixer, but a better center of learn-
ing after the advent of women. Next, three female 
graduates from these early years describe their experiences 
at the cutting edge of coeducation, often sensing disaffec-
tion similar to what women of color continue to feel today. 
As more women arrived, feminism gained a voice on cam-
pus through Aurora and the Women's Center, and im-
provements occurred slowly in the area of academics, 
although the need remains for significant improvement in 
the number of tenured women professors. Women have 
brought other unique concerns to Yale, including eating 
disorders, which affect a majority of female students here. 
Deficiencies in the women's sports program also merit the 
University's increased attention. On the lighter side, we 
bring you cartoonist Sandra Boynton, one of Yale's most il-
lustrious illustrators. 

For four years, we have no other world than Yale. It's a 
malleable place when one considers the relative speed of its 
evolution from a bastion of masculinity. In several years we 
may realize how few other institutions can move so quickly. 
The coeducation of Yale is not yet complete. Although 
we can blame the slow pace of societal advancements, that 
fact remains. If change is to take place. let it be here.

The First Rabbis 
To the Editor: 
Although Tamar Lehrich's recent arti-
cle 
on Orthodox Jewish students 
("Within Two Worlds," TNJ, February 
1, 1985) was quite illuminating, some 
aspects of the author's historical portrait 
require correction. 

RabbiJames Ponet is not the frrst Yale 
graduate to become a rabbi. Rabbt 
Solomon Kohn was ordained even before 
he t'nroUed at Yale. He received his 
bachelor's degree in 1876. Rabbi Wolff 
Willner was graduated from Yale in 
1881. He was ordained in 1887-the 
same year that Yale granted him a 
master's degree. 

Ac; for the assertion that "three fun-
damental changes have occurred durin~ 
the last decade enabling the Orthodox 
Je~ to attend Yale," the author is wrong. 
Thts statement unfairly ignores the ac-
complishments of people such as Hillel 
RaJ:>bi 
Richard 
Israel 
( 1959-1971 ), 
Umversity Chaplain \\'illiam Sloane Cof-
fin (1958-1975) and Yale President A. 
Whitney Griswold (1950-1963).

**Title: When Yale Needed "Girls"**

When Yale Needed "Girls" 
Tony Reese 
Men walked through Payne Whitney Gym nude. They ate dinner in 
roa.ts and ties. They drove to the Seven Sisters schools on weekends, and 
a few died in car crashes each year. They stared across dining halls at 
busloads of women who had come for a Yale mixer. For the Harvard 
game, their girlfriends came to New Haven and stayed in the Taft Hotel. 
Women were dates, seen on the weekends; men were friends and com-
rades who lived, ate, played and studied together. 

Yale in 1960 closely resembled the 18th-century college that preced-
ed it. By the decade's end Yale had undergone some radical changes and 
set others in motion. "The University was dragged, kicking and scream-
ing, into the 20th century," said Henry'Sam' Chauncey, Jr., '57, former 
University secretary. The decision to admit women marked the era's 
most fundamental transformation. 

It took the Admissions Office only a week to begin considering women 
applicants in 1968, but the decision to roeducate took over 10 years to 
evolve. The earliest serious mention of the idea came from then-Dean of 
Admissions Arthur Howe, Jr. at a September 1956 closed faculty 
meeting. "I became increasingly aware that a sizable number of people I 
was interested in for Yale did not apply or considered Yale their second 
choice because it was single-sex," said Howe. "And elements of social life 
here were incredibly distorted without women. So I spent the last 10 
minutes of my annual report on the glory of the entering class suggesting 
Yale consider admitting women. There was a thunderous response, very 
!POSitive enthusiasm. 

•nean William DeVane, however, was of a more temperate mind and 
recommended forming a committee to study the idea. That was it. An 
hour later I walked through my front door and the babysitter said, 'Gee 
Mr. Howe, I think it's great.' I didn't know what she was talking about. 
'That Yale's going coed,' she said. Some moonlighting scoundrel had ap-
parently given the story to a local radio station. The next morning 77ze 
New York Tunes printed it." 

President Griswold immediately declared Yale was "far from being 
..u:Jnvu· _,... that it would be the right course of action. There is not the 
pmotest possibility of its taking place at Yale within the foreseeable 
future.• The Yale Daily News (YDN) responded enthusiastically to 
~s 
denial. "'h save us!" the days editorial read. "Oh save us 
from giggling crowds, the domestic lecture and the home economics 
dasses of female inflltration. We will not spend our 25th reunion drinking 
with overweight matrons and their husbands who went to Hofstra. And 
the library stacks will not be indoor lovers lanes, and Mory's on Friday 
afternoons will not be the seen~ of chattering bridge parties." 

"I just started seeing a 
Yale co-ed and I see 
her constantly. I've 
gotten no work done 
whatsoever and this 
has got to stop."

•1 think the way it got out did more 
than anything to postpone coeducation 
by 10 years," H owe said. "The Presi-
dent's Office was swamped with letters 
from disgruntled alumni. The only 
significant development that came out 
of my suggestion was an increased 
awareness of the possibility." 

Other changes were already taking 
place, though. "Yale in the 1950s was 
overwhelmingly prep school, wealthy 
and Eastern," Chauncey said. "In my 
class I remember one student from 
California and one black student. It's 
extraordinary how parochial it was." In 
1965 R . lnslee 'Inky' Clark, Jr., '57, 
the new dean of admissions, aimed to 
change that. "I wanted to strengthen 
and deepen the applicant pool to secure 
stronger representation from groups not 
traditionally in it," Clark said. "Then 
the Admissions Committee would be 
able to find the strong applicants need-
ed to diversify the student body." 

•Inky beat the bushes in areas Yale 
not really approached before," said 
Kingman Brewster Jr., then Yale's 
president. The number of public-
a:bool, minority, and non-East Coast 
ltudents at Yale increased as a result. 
~ile only 44 percent of the Class of 
!1963 attended public school, 61 percent 
r
the Class of 1971 had gone to such 
ools. 

The possibility of including women 
this diversification arose in March 
1966 when the 
Yale Corporation 
declared its interest in establishing a 
coordinate college for women separate 
from Yale College within the Universi-
~· similar to arrangements between 
narvard and Radcliffe and other Ivy 
:League universities. Brewster's desire to 
a link between Yale and Vassar 
all.lcilleges apparently spurred this move . 
._._:Brewster and Vassar President Alan 
--.Jp80n dreamt .the whole idea up," 
Chauncey said. "In the mid-1960s the 
bwo became personal friends through 
· wives. Simpson once remarked 
aaar had no future as a small 
men's college in the face of other 
lchools' coeducation and 
mounting 
fmancial pressures on quality. The two 
proposed the Vassar campus move to 
Yale.• 

· 
In December the Yale Corporation 
and the Vassar trustees formally agreed 
to study the project's feasibility. At 
Vassar the study's announcement met 
with 
frenzied jubilation. 
Students 
serenaded Simpson with "Boola, Boola" 
and "The Whiffenpoof Song," draped 
their windows with banners reading 
"Beat H arvard" and "For Sale" and 
changed Vassar's "Wisdom and Purity" 
motto to "Wisdom and Men" and Yale's 
to "For God, for Country, for Yale and 
Vassar." Vassar alumnae and faculty 
were less jubilant. T hey did not want to 
give up their campus and tradition and 
feared the college would lose its in-
dependence in a large, highly respected 
research university like Yale. 

In New H aven the proposal met 
favorable but subdued reaction. A YDN 
poll the year before had found students 
felt four-to-one that women "would im-
prove Yale," while faculty agreed by 
nine-to-one. Rumors circulated that 
freshman physical education had been 
dropped that year as part of a plan to 
abandon the gym and convert it into 
Vassar's New Haven campus. The Yale 
Precision Marching Band divided into 
"'¥" and "V" formations and tried to 
consummate the 
relationship 
pre-
maturely during a halftime show. Each 
residential college affiliated with a 
Vassar house and held numerous joint 
events. (Lathrup H ouse's 14-7 defeat of 
Berkeley in touch football may have 
raised second thoughts among Yale 
students.) 

According to the study committee's 
tentative plan, Yale would build a new 
Divinity School behind Pierson ("The 
Div students wanted to be downtown 
where the action was in poverty and 
social activism," Chauncey remem-
bered) and Vassar would move into the 
Divinity School and surrounding area. 
•we trooped up Science HiU with the 
Vassar Board of Trustees to show them 
the trees," Chauncey said. "They con-
sidered Vassar's beautiful trees an im-
portant asset and we had to find a 
similar site here." Despite intricate 
plans for coordinating classes and 
preserving each college's independence, 
Vassar ultimately rejected the proposal 
in November. 




**Title: Yale's Transition to Coeducation**
**Author: Not specified**

Yale was stunned when the engage-
ment turned out to have been only a 
courtship, but the experience raised stu-
dent expectations for coeducation. "The 
Vassar episode was very useful, very 
helpful to Yale," Brewster said. "The 
purgatorical period when we were 
negotiating with Vassar got the trustees 
and alumni used to the idea of 
undergraduate 
women 
at Yale. 
I 
favored the plan at the time, though in 
retrospect I'm glad they declined." He 
began to look into other options almost 
immediately, becoming convinced co-
education was an important part of 
Yale's future. 

Alumni support strengthened Brew-
ster's resolve. "I consulted with two very 
generous donors," Brewster said. "They 
said to act first and make financial ad-
justments later because they felt the 
commitment should be unambiguous." 
According to Chauncey, "John H ay 
Whitney, probably the University's 
largest single donqr, was very en-
couraging, and if the largest donor 
jumps on the bandwagon it is easier to 
handle complaints from those alumni 
who send $5 to $1 0 a year and threaten 
to cut off their support." 

In September 1968 Princeton re-
leased a study indicating 80 percent of 
the nation's top high school students 
thought coeducation made a college 
~ore attractive and only four percent 
thought it made it less attractive. 
Princeton appeared headed rapidly 
toward coeducation, a blow to the pride 
of Yale students, who feared the 
~niversity would at best end up follow-
Ing Princeton's lead and at worst 
become the only all-male Ivy school if 
Princeton and Dartmouth admitted 
women. "Healthy competition between 
Yale and Princeton was an immediate, 
driving force," said Elga Wasserman, 
fir:st chairman of the University Com-
mntee on Coeducation. 

"We thought we'd be left out of the 
parade," Brewster said. "To be a single-
sex institution at a time when all kinds 
of schools were going coed meant a 
more and more difficult time attracting 
s!udents." The students may have con-
Sidered it a question of honor, but the 
Elga Wasserman ran the Coeducation Office for two years and is now a 
lawyer in New Haven 
administration saw a potential crisis of 
quality. 

The Corporation unanimously decid-
ed undergraduate education for women 
would improve the quality of Yale Col-
lege and in October directed the ad-
ministration to develop a plan of 
coeducation or coordination. Student 
debate shifted focus from whether to 
coeducate to how and when. Students 
for a Democratic Society demanded 
immediate full coeducation. The Class 
of 1969 claimed they would withhold 
their class gift until the administration 
formalized a plan. 

In early October the campus-wide 
Committee on Student Life put up 
posters urging students to push for 
coeducation: "The answer has to be 
coeducation. There is no middle road. 
Yale needs girls and girls need Yale. To 
dramatize this issue, we suggest that 
students arrange for geodesic domes to 
be placed on the Cross Campus as tem-
porary living quarters. Then, invite a 
few hundred girls from surrounding 
colleges to Yale for a week." The idea 
caught on. "To make a valid decision 
about what women want in a coeduca-
tional school, it seems logical to talk to 
women about it," Aviam Soifer, '69, 
wrote, proposing to invite 500 women 
to Yale between November 4 and 11. 

Over 2,000 women from nearby col-
leges expressed interest in participating. 
The organizers scrapped the geodesic 
domes when the adminstration agreed 
to let the women stay in dorms, 
recruited students to host women, 
raised money to pay for meals and 
selected 700 women to stay for two half-
week shifts. 

Coeducation thus arrived earlier than 
expected, though not to stay. There 
were speeches, 
teach-ins and film 
festivals; women attended classes, ate in 
dining halls and stayed in men's dorm 
rooms. A rally of 750 Yale and women 
students marched to Brewster's house 
demanding coeducation. Over 1, 700 
students petitioned f~r equal num~rs 
of men and women m the next class, 
women transfer students for the up-
perclasses and an increase in women 
faculty members. The YDN carried an 
ad for "Quality Aphrodisiacs for Coed 
Week." 

Reactions were mixed, though large-
ly favorable. "Coming from an all-girls' 
school, I didn't mind being appreciated 
all week long," one woman wrote. "This

nus whose daughter has been rejected. 
They were more protective of their 
daughters than of their sons; they 
equated rejecting their daughters with 
accusing them of being women of ill 
repute." 

T hose daughters were considered for 
admission by Chauncey, whom 
Brewster had appointed director of ad-
ministrative planning for coeducation, 
and Wasserman, who had been an 
assistant dean of the Graduate School 
and prospective master of the female 
T rumbull CoUege. Together the two 
were in charge of making coeducation 
happen in September 1969, beginning 
with the admissions process. 

"Sam and I read all the women's ap-
plications," Wassserman said. "We had 
slightly different criteria for the women. 
We knew this would be a pioneer class 
facing pioneer-type problems." 

Chauncey elaborated: "We believed it 
would be hardest on the upperclass 
women who would be in small groups 
in the colleges among men who had 
spent time at an all-male Yale. We tried 
to detect stability, strength, toughness." 

Over 4 ,000 women applied for the 588 
openings, while men had a much higher 
acceptance rate of four-to-one. This 
selectivity would eventually surface in 
the consistently higher grades women 
received during the first few years. 

The weekend before acceptance let-
ters went out Tht Ntw York Timts 
Magaziru reported, .. Many late-night 
buU sessions at Yale today reflect a cer-
tain nervousness over the confrontation

mensch• and described some of them:

achievement tests. She had great recom-
mendations." 

Many applicants read the article and 
despaired. "What difference could it 
have made to Tht Ntw York Timts 
whether they published that article a 
week before or a week after our notifica-
tion? How insensitive could they be? I 
spent a hellish week just waiting for 
news. I was so nervous. I'd given up 
hope," commented one ·woman who was 
later accepted. 

Those whom Yale accepted and who 
accepted Yale faced great difficulties in 
the fail, mostly stemming from the 
eight-to-one ratio of men to women ... In 
retrospect, I view the housing situation 
as the major problem," Wasserman 
said. "The small number of women 
caused practical problems in rooming. 
Women roomed in fours, and out of 20 
to 25 students in each college it was 
hard to get congenial rooming ar-
rangements. The situation emphasized 
the women's minority status as if they 
were in a fishbowl." Media coverage 
treating coeducation as a "freakish ex-
periment," Wasserman added, inten-
sified the sense of being under observa-
tion. 

The ratio also caused problems in the 
classroom. "Manv classes had very few 
women," Wasserman said. "If a woman 
was absent, everyone noticed. Some 
professors asked their female students 
for the 
'women's point of view.' 
Overall, it just made for a more self-
conscious presence than would have 
been ideal." One professor com-
plimented a Directed Studies student 
for having worked so hard and finally 
reached the academic level cf the men 
in the class.

cw customed to an all-male Yale felt most 
uncomfortable. 

"There really 
is 
a 
dichotomy in my mind between friends 
and women. Women are dates," one 
student commented in Women at Yale, a 
book compiled by two women sociology 
graduate students. "I've never been in a 
situation before where I could have a 
girl as a friend. All the girls you'd meet 
were on weekends in this compulsive 
date situation. And you didn't hav~ 
time to be friends with them. So I don't 
really relate to the girls in my college. I 
don't feel I need to." Such attitudes were 
reinforced by the survival of the 
weekend dating system as a means of 
coping with the lopsided ratio. "H ap-
piness is not Importable" protested ban-
ners hung from some windows. 

Men often had trouble integrating 
their sexual/social life with the rest of 
their college life. "My freshman year 
was beautiful," a sophomore said. 
"Really beautiful. I was never distracted 
during the week and I had this great 
weekt>nd social life. This year has been 
different. I don't get much work done. I 
wish I did, but I don't. I just started see-
ing a Yale coed and I see her constantly, 
constantly. I've gotten no work done 
whatsoever and this has got to stop. I 
mean, something has really got to be 
done about it- I've got to get some 
work done, I really do!" 

"The group which turned out to be 
most opposed to the situation was the 
secretaries and female dining hall 
employees," Chauncey said. "In an all-
male institution, the men at least found 
sisters and mothers in these women and 
occasionally even dated them. Some of 
these people showed real hostility to the 
women students. Master's wives, for ex-
ample, were used to having 400 'sons' 
who adored them and would talk to 
them and now they didn't come around 
anymore." 

"May Day 1970 marked a big turning 
point," Wasserman said. "Suddenly, the 
focus of student energies was external. 
The women participated as equal 
members on a common project. After-
ward they were never as self-conscious 
as before. The novelty of coeducation 
now had a replacement." 

"Yale was dragged, 
kicking and screaming 
into the 20th century." 

M uch progress was made simply by 
the passage of time, with people getting 
used to having women at Yale. Some 
problems took longer and even persist; 
both Sterling Library's Linonia and 
Brothers' reading room and Mory's did 
not admit women until the mid-1970s 
and three senior societies still exclude 
women. In the case of at least one socie-
ty, the exclusion of women resulted 
from a change of the organization's 
charter in 1969 from calling for the selec-
tion of "15 leaders of the junior class" to 
"15 male leaders." 

The Coeducation Office, run by 
Wasserman, coordinated the Universi-
ty's official efforts to facilitate integra-
tion, including resident graduate af-
filiates in each college, a special career 
advisory program and efforts to in-
crease the number of female role models 
and to equalize the male-female ratio. 
Most activism after 1969 focused on 
the ratio. The controversy concerned 
Yale's plan to increase the number of 
wom en by building new housing, rather 
than by reducing the number of men. 
The debate rallied around Brewster's 
alleged guarantee that Yale would pro-
duce "1000 male leaders" a year. 
Brewster denies saying this, and there is 
scant evidence to the contrary, but the 
original plan d id call for maintaining 
the 
number 
of men 
at its 
pre-
coeducation level. When New H aven 
rejected Yale's plan to build two new 
colleges, 
many students and 
ad-
ministrators called for the elimination of 
the quota of 1000 men. In December 
1972 the Corporation voted to admit 
students to the Class of 1978 without 
regard to sex, overcoming the last of-
ficial U niversity obstacle to complete 
coeducation. 


Henry "Sam" Chauncey served as 
coeducation planning director. 
"The' problems of women at Yale to· 
day are the problems of women in socie-
ty, especially in academic society " 
Chauncey said, and two of the fir~t 
three heads of the Coeducation Office 
agree with him. They believe the 
specific difficulties growing out of Yale's 
267 -year all-male tradition are gone. 
Other problems have replaced them, 
but these are shared by society and 
other universities, although Yale still 
bears responsibility for trying to solve 
them. 

Wasserman does not fully agree. 
We've made progress. But there is still 
an all-male quality at Yale that is more 
overwhelming than in society at large. I 
don't think it is prevalent within the 
student body, but in the University. A 
lot of institutional expectations still have 
to change. The tenure structure hasn't 
changed at all; promotion still coincides 
with child-bearing years. Yale is geared 
to a male lifest5'le more than elsewhere. 
It shows up in the expected role of the 
faculty 
wif~-the whole career of a 
faculty member is based on the wife 
washing his shirts, taking care of his 
travel plans and so forth. There are a lot 
of very interesting cultural issues which 
Yale has not addressed; it simply ex-
pects everyone to muddle through." 

. In the 1960s the most clearly ar-
ticulated reasons for coeducation were a 
need to attract high-quality students 
an~ a desire to improve the quality of 
socaal and extracurricular life. Faculty 
also felt coeducation would improve 
classroom learning by broadening 
perspective. Others, like Clark, saw a 
larger issue. "Yale is one of the greatest 
in~titutions in the world, and to deter-
mane that its facilities should be limited 
to half the population by an arbitrary 
rule seemed to me illogical. You could 
see coeducation 
as the final 
culminating step in the process of mak~ 
ing the student body more represen-
tative," Clark said. "There is a certain 
consistency between the two," Brewster 
said, "but it was not plotted. I'm not a 
very good planner." 

Wasserman 
suggested two other 
reasons Yale coeducated. "Overall, the 
500 to 800 women students brought 
money to the University. Little new 
housing was built, virtually no new 
faculty were hired, but Yale got 500 
more tuition and room payments. 
Traditionally, schools in trouble in-
crease enrollment. Yale achieved a 
financial goal and got credit for being 
farsighted. Also, the whole climate of 
the times helped. This place exists in 
society and it mirrors outside changes. 
It can't get too far out of date without 
getting into trouble." 

"Innately the single-sex Yale was 
wrong," Chauncey said. "A lot of us felt 
very strongly about the ethical and 
moral questions, including Brewster. 
But Kingman 
the ultimate 
pragmatist. Coeducation was the se-
cond greatest thing he did for Yale, 
right after getting it through the turmoil 
of the times with positive goals. Initially 
he began without even realizing he 
believed in it, just seeing a practical 
end. He didn't preach great and noble 
thoughts. Getting there in the end was 
what interested him. It was a matter of 
achieving something that if you took the 
moral high-road you probably wouldn't 
have achieved."

To get to Barbara Riley's house, fmd $1.15 in change and take the 
"S-Clinton" bus from the city down Route One, past the Montana Horse 
Ranch and Cozzi's Turkey Farm. While the jour ney to Guilford takes 
only 25 minutes, this small, densely-wooded town looks nothing like New 
Haven. Wander through the Country Dairy Store, past the American 
flags and white colonial homes, and'when you see the sign advising "15 
miles per hour" on a lane no more than 10 feet wide, you've probably 
reached Dunkrock Road. Barbara Riley lives here in a bright red, all-
wood, solar home her husband designed and built. The property 
borders on 2000 acres of state hiking trails. Nearby there is a pond for 
ice-skating and fishing and a grove of raspberry bushes where Riley's 
three children spend afternoons. 

Riley, '73, is one of the 230 women admitted to Yale's first fully coed 
class. Though a few of these first women have achieved fame and fman-
cial reward, most still search for their own defmitions of success and 
satisfaction. Riley belongs to a small group of women who, more than a 
decade after graduation, live and work only minutes away from the 
rooms they occupied at Yale. The women and their perceptions of their 
college experiences defy generalization, and each has her own story to tell 
about her time at Yale. 

Riley was one of a handful of transfer students admitted in 1969. H av-
ing grown up in a suburb of Minneapolis, she attended Minnesota's 
Lawrence University for two years. "I got married at age 20, which I still 
can't believe," Riley said, helping her four-year-old son Nathaniel pull on 
his boots and ushering him outside. When Riley's husb~d was admitted 
to the Yale School of Architecture, the couple moved to New Haven, and 
she worked for three years as administrative assistant to the dean in 
Timothy Dwight. Once she and her husband felt fmancially secure, Riley 
applied and was accepted to Yale. 

Drinking tea in her kitchen, Riley explained how her experiences as a 
married 23-year-old junior entering Yale were very different from those 
of her classmates. "I was able to come into Yale, take what I wanted and 
leave. It never was a social world for me, though at times I did feel self-
conscious about being older than most students." Because of her work ex-
perience at Yale, Riley easily established a diverse circle of friends com-
posed of undergraduates, architecture students, fellows and faculty. "My 
three years of working gave me time off to crave being in college and real-
ly to appreciate Yale. I was a little more aloof than most other women, 
but no one reacted in a hostile or negative way towards me just because I 
happened to be married."

Riley didn't encounter any of the sex-
ism or separatism she said many 
women from the Class of 1973 felt. 
While others were most offended by 
paternalistic attitudes among Yale's 
faculty and administration, Riley said · 
she felt more empathetic and accepting. 
"I never felt diminished or threatened 
by the men. I just couldn't get angry at 
professors for their old-style man-
nerisms, for they weren't intentional; it 
wasn't representative of their complete 
philo~ophy." She paused. "Having 
women around was probably .a· relief 
after dealing with boys and frater-
nities- Yale became more civilized." 
An American studies major, Riley 
continued at Yale as a graduate stu-
dent. Though it has been eight years 
since she started her dissertation, and 
though she has not yet chosen to seek 
employment outside the home, Riley 
does not view her life as static. "I 
treasure the time I've been at home with 
my kids," she said softly, "but if I ever 
defmed my life by theirs, I'd feel upset 
and sick. I know at one point it will be 
the right time to finish, to write the 
dissertation and to teach on a college 
level." 
Riley sees a dramatic difference be-
tween the students she knew in the 
1960s and today's students at Yale. An 
advocate of New Deal social policies, 
Riley disagrees with much of President 
R eagan's philosophy. "At Yale I became 
politicized and intellectually excited for 
the first time. I thought being political 
was a lasting legacy from Vietnam, but 
I was wrong. I assumed everyone from 
age 20 would be aware and active. It's 
scary, but maybe by the time I'm 
teaching, I'll have to begin by defining 
liberalism for my students," she said, 
handing dried apricots to her eight-
year-old daughter, Gerun. "Students 
now are more distracted. In a sense 
they are truly out in the world because 
they have already imagined themselves 
there." Riley placed her teacup in the 
bright red kitchen sink. Wearing purple 
pants and a blue sweater, she seemed to 
blend in with the colorful room. "I may 
be 36 years old, but I'd give anything to 
go through Yale again. At the time I 
never thought it was wonderful, be-

cause I didn't imagine it ending." Bar-
bara Riley watched as her daughter 
rolled a handful of dice on the kitchen 
table. "Those years are a magical time," 
Riley said. She looked at her daughter, 
and they both laughed. 


Nina H orowitz, '75, took a far dif-
ferent path from Riley's. A doctor and a 
surgeon, H orowitz practices in an office 
on Church Street. On the wall next to 
her diploma from Columbia University 
Medical School hangs a certificate pro-
claiming Horowitz "a member of 
Calhoun College on the roll of the com-
pany of scholars." A black chair en-
graved with the Yale crest faces her 
desk. Now in her early 30s, Horowitz 
has jet-black hair and smoky-grey eyes. 
She glanced at the chair and explained, 
"It's brand new. 
All the surgical 
residents at Yale-New H aven H ospital 
get them." She hesitated. "I know it 
looks pretentious, but it's comfortable. I 
wouldn't want it in my own home, but 
for the office it's O.K." 
H orowitz calls herself one of the first 
female Yale boosters, but ironically, 
when she applied to Yale 14 years ago 
from an experimental high school in 
Maryland, it was in response to a dare. 
Once she was admitted Horowitz had 
no qualms coming to an institution 
where women were a minority, for she 
felt prepared after growing up with 
three brothers. Still, there were a few 
surprises. "My freshman year, women 
from Smith, Mt. Holyoke and Vassar 
were being bused into New Haven 
every Friday afternoon," Horowitz 
remembered. "It was totally bizarre. As 
the women entered the dining hall, the 
guys would hold up napkins rating 
them from zero to 10. The guys also 
claimed they could tell a Yale woman 
from the others solely by her sloppier at· 
tire." New H aven's Albert us Magnus 
College was a major, pervasive presence 
at Yale during this time. "At a mixer, if 
a Yale guy knew you went to Yale he'd 
turn around and walk away, looking for 
1 , a girl from another school," H orowitz 
explained. "My female friends and I 
had to bring a group of our male friends 
with us to mixers as security blankets-
someone to dance with. I felt as though 
my role should be as 'one of the guys,' 
everybody's best buddy. The women 
bused in were the exciting, hot lovers, 
while I was just 'comfortable.' Now it's 
beyond belief." · 
Horowitz perceived herself to be 
more the victim of subtle discrimination 
than blatant sexism. Several times she 
found herself the only woman in a 
seminar. "The professor would turn to 
me and say, 'Nina, as a woman, what is 
your view on this?' That really offended 
me," she admitted. "But the most 
discriminatory, biased group was the 
alums. They'd sit in the Calhoun dining 
hall and tell the women they had stop· 
ped giving money to Yale because we 
were admitted." 
Following the pre-med 
route, 
Horowitz frequently felt singled out. , 
While women at Yale were not entirely 
absent from the sciences, there were 
significantly 
fewer 
than 
in 
the 
humanities. "I never chose a science 
course where I'd be totally visible. It's 
hard to believe, but I never had a 
female lab partner at Yale," she said, 
leaning back in her thick leather chair. 
Horowitz also recognized signs of 
favoritism and reverse discrimination in 
her classes. "In one of Wolfgang 
Leonhard's courses, I could predict who 
my T A would · call on and who would 
get A's just by the number of 'thin 
lovelies' in the section. He was absolute· 
ly enthralled by a few of them," she 
remembered. A lack of female role 
models at Yale became another area of 
contention for Horowitz. "I can count 
on one hand the number of women I 


was taught by at Yale. It angers me that 
even those women never got tenure." 
By her senior year Horowitz came to 
accept and appreciate her Yale ex-
perience with only a few reservations. A 
freshman cot•nselor, a master's aide 
and a member of both the Slavic 
Chorus and the senior society Elihu, 
Horowitz felt women were increasingly 
integrated and "no longer an oddity." 
She explained, "It gives me a sense of 
pride that Yale made a commitment to 
offer opportunities women should never 
be deprived of having," H orowitz con-
firmed. In stark contrast to Riley, she 
believes, "Being one of the first women 
grads can make you feel obligated to be 
an outspoken leader and achiever. 
Many Yale women felt as if they were 
wasting their time if they didn't get 
super, macho jobs." 
H orowitz and her husband, a Yale 
graduate student in psychology, now 
live on the corner of Orange and Hum-
phrey Streets. A decade after grad-
uating, she admit~ to feeling like just 
another "old blue on the eve of her 1Oth 
reunion." Yet, only with time did 
H orowitz develop that sense of famili-
arity and comfort in being a Yalie. "To-
day Yale is probably a more normal 
place to be," she said reflectively. "It 
must be nice to go to a college where be-
ing a woman doesn't have to be an 
issue." 


Emily Fine, '73, a close friend of 
Horowitz, sat in her office in the Com-
munity Health Care Center (CHCC), 
down the road from the Long Wharf 
Theater. Fine may be only a few miles 
away from Yale and her friend, whom 
she met when Horowitz was a resident, 
but the symbolic distance between them 
is greater. Like Horowitz, Fine became 
a doctor and lives in the New Haven 
area, but she herself admitted, "Nina is 
much more :Joe College' than I'll ever 
be." 
The Obstetrics/Gynecology Depart-
ment lies hidden in a labyrinth of 
hallways and nurses' stations on the se-
cond floor of the CHCC building. The 
waiting room there is filled with preg-
nant women, young children, infants 
and a smattering of men. The recep-
tionist reads Your Daily Horoscope For '85. 
. Dr. Fine, one of seven women and two 
men in the division, receives a chorus of 
greetings when she steps into the 
waiting room. Wearing a black skirt 
which falls above the knee, high black 
boots and a furry sweater, Fine looks

young enough to be a student. Her cur-
ly, light-brown hair bounces as she 
walks into her office, shared with a 
female colleague. On a shelf sit family 
photos, an ET doll and a couple of 
stuffed frogs. 

"I ended up coming to Yale for all 
sorts of nondescript reasons," Fine said 
between bites of a peanut butter and jel-
ly sandwich. Her two primary interests 
freshman year were music-she played 
the french horn with the Yale and the 
New Haven symphonies- and . medi-
cine. Yet Fine's experiences in science 
courses and her perceptions of Yale's at-
titude toward women became increas-
ingly negative. By the end of her 
sophomore year she decided to move off 
campus and to forgo her medical school 
aspirations. "It was devastating being 
one of 10 women in a lecture hall with 
200 aggressive, intimidating men from 
intense prep schools. It was equally in-
timidating not even knowing those nine 
other women," she explained. Fine feels 
Yale made no effort to create a support 
system for the first women under-
graduates. "The arrival of women pro-
vided a lot of news for The New York 
Times, and I had a sense we were being 
evaluated on an ongoing basis," Fine 
asserted. "Yale thought painting the 
bathrooms in Vanderbilt pretty colors 
and putting up full-length mirrors was 
adequate, but it was really more subtle 
than that." 

Fine believes sequestering all the 
women in Vanderbilt Hall on Old 
Campus only served to create feelings of 
insularity and alienation. "There was a 
funny dichotomy. Yale placed a guard 
under the Vanderbilt arch 24 hours a 
day, but the man was usually in-
ebriated. We felt like Rapunzel in her 
tower, but Yale assumed our needs to 
be identical to any previous students'," 
Fine said strongly. "We were goldfish in 
a bowl. It was easy to feel sort of special, 
but it was very difficult to develop a 
sense of female camaraderie. Faculty 
members didn't stop reminding us they 
couldn't walk around naked in the gym 
anymore." 

While she admits to having been "a 
little on the stuffy side politically" dur-
ing high school, Fine embraced some 
controversial issues at Yale to a much 
greater extent than either Riley or 
Horowitz. "Students really carried a 
feeling of responsibility to address the 
world's woes," she remembered. "The 
desire to provide a service for the com-
munity-to be a teacher-was respec-
ted in the 1960s. Then, if someone said 
he wanted to go into banking, he'd pro-
bably be stoned." Fine's extensive in-
volvement in the Yale Women's Center 
and the Women's Abortion Referral 
Service rejuvenated her interest in 
medicine. "It was virtually impossible 
for women to get abortions in Connec-
ticut. Our group was composed of Yale 
undergrads and New Haven women 
who were concerned with feminist 
issues," 
Fine observed. 
"I finally

discovered a group of women to talk 
and share ideas with." 

Fine spent senior year fulfilling pre-
med requirements and in the fall she 
entered the Yale School of Medicine. 
"I've always been 
interested 
in 
gynecology, and the feminist movement 
helped me get in touch with those in-
terests," Fine said, finishing her sand-
wich. "It's really important now for 
women to enter this field. I've been able 
to remain involved in feminism from a 
political point of view as well as dealing 
with women's health issues." Fine cur-
rently teaches Yale medical students 
and works with new residents. 

Living in Hamden with her two 
children and her husband, a surgeon 
who works with Horowitz, Fine is slow-
ly coming to terms with her critical 
perceptions of Yale. "In some ways Yale 
is a microcosm of the real world," Fine 
asserted, glancing at her watch. "There 
still remains an elitist quality at Yale, 
and part of that elitism is sexism. Even 
today when people hear the word Yale, 
there is on some level the image of a 
male institution." A pregnant woman 
holding the hand of a small boy peeked 
through the doorway of Fine's office. 
"Well, it looks like it's back to patients," 
Fine said, smiling as the mother and 
child entered the room.

I've had enough
I'm sick of seeing and touching
with silks of things
Sick of being the damn bridge for everybody
Nobody
Can talk to anybody
Without me Right?
I explain my mother to my father my father to my little sister
My little sister to my brother my brother to the white feminists
The white feminists to the Black church folks the Black church folks
To the ex-hippies the ex-hippies to the Black separatists the
Black separatists to the artists the artists to my friends' parents ...
Then
I've got to explain myself
To everybody
-"The Bridge Poem" by Donna Kate Rushin from This Bridge Called My Back, a collection
of writing by women of color

At first glance, you don't think the woman walking to a remote corner of 
Machine City can see herself in these words, nor do you assume she co-
ordinated a conference last year that brought many writers from This 
Bridge to speak at Yale. She dresses inconspicuously in a blue sweatshirt 
and jeans. People do not look up as she moves with an easy yet deter-
mined stride towards a clean table and slips quietly into a seat. Ahna 
Ayala, CC '86, clears her throat and begins speaking in a voice unique for 
its rhythmic balance of words and silence. 

"It's a definite cultural shock when you come to a place like Yale, so you 
want to hold on to something within you," she said. "But sometimes peo-
ple think if you want to hold on to your cultural background you just want 
to stand out and you don't want to learn the 'American way.' Of course I 
believe we should learn English and the skills needed to survive in this 
culture, but at the same time that doesn't mean we should give up 
everything that means anything to us- forget our Spanish, our music, 
everything else. I've heard people say, 'No speaking Spanish,' and to 
them it's a joke, but it's not." 

Although Ayala's parents came from Puerto Rico, she was born and 
raised in the United States. Having lived in several cities, Ayala attended 
schools with varied ethnic populations. Despite the diverse student body 
here, she feels alienated from most of the Yale community. 

"When I came here there was a lot I had to get used to. A lot of what I 
was taught was very different from what I first experienced here. I sat 
down with some of my friends who were white, and I'd try to explain to 
them I felt alienated and I hadn't heard of many of the customs here. 
But my white friends couldn't understand what I was talking about." 

Although the Class of 1988 is 17.3 percent people of color and 41.4 
percent female, many women of color perceive Yale as still very male and 
very white. They feel it on an academic level in the number of white 
male professors, the courses and majors offered, the methods of teaching 
and the literature and interpretations of history students read. Most im-
portantly they feel it on the social level in the way whites and people of 
color at Yale communicate or rather, fail to communicate. 

Unable to explain her experiences to her white friends, Ayala fre-
quently visited her floating counselor, a Puerto Rican woman. "The only 
escape we have is among ourselves, because we understand what we're 
feeling, and we know we're not imagining. We can get together and talk 
about it and help each other get through this kind of place," Ayala said. 
"But if you go up to somebody who doesn't understand and they ask you, 
'Well, do you think racism is everywhere?' and you say, 'Yes, it is every-
where,' they say to you, 'Oh, you're just feeling persecuted. You're just 
letting your imagination run away with you.'

"If you were the only white person at 
Yale and you found another white per-
son, I guarantee you'd be very excited 
and you'd want to get together and share 
your experiences," Ayala continued. "A 
lot of the Puerto Ricans here have shared 
the same experiences and understand 
where you're coming from. So you're go-
ing to be around people who support 
you. Jocks hang out together, gays hang 
out together, actors hang out together. 
But we arc conspicuous." 

When people of color sit together in 
Commons, go to their cultural houses or 
speak a language other than English, they 
appear separatist. To many people of col-
or, however, this perception reveals 
deep, widespread misunderstandings 
about their involvement in the Yale com-
munity. Through their organizations and 
informal 
gatherings 
people of color 
believe they are preserving, sharing and 
nurturing a special bond. A more serious 
misunderstanding arises when people 
view racist acts as only harmless pranks. 
Even more subtle and yet more frus-
trating is the 'color blindness' of many 
whites who try not to notice racial dif-
ferences. The need to ignore differences 
implies 'differences' mean 'inequalities,' 
and people of color see 'color blind 
courtesy' as subtle racism that ignores 
their cultural and personal history and 
trivializes thetr oppression. 

"Subtle racism is so tricky, because fre-
quently it comes out of a sincere desire to 
be less racist than those who came before 
you," said Caroline Jackson, '74, director 
of the Afro-Americar Cultural Center 
and one of the first black undergraduate 
women at Yale. "The person who has not 
grown up in an oppressed group fre-
quently winds up tripping all over herself 
trying to demonstrate sincerity which in 
and of itself becomes offensive." 

Karen Porter,JE '86, a first generation 
Jamaican American who attended a 
mostly white high school, thinks Yale 
students avoid racism to an obvious ex-
tent. "You feel like you're working on a 
very superficial level and you're not sure 
how liberal Yale is. It seems you're not 
truly hearing what's going on and getting 
a false picture because people don't com-
municate straightforwardly. Comments 
are covered up in some way to look good, 
not conservative or uninteUigent." 

Subtle racism often betrays itself in the 
way people speak-their tone, word 
choice, the things they choose to talk 
about. Sometimes people introduce a 
person of color as "my Mexican friend" or 
"the black roommate." 

"Some people try to figure out what 
race you are by your eyes, and you think, 
'Why don't you just ask me?'" said Amy 
Yamashiro, ES '87, co-coordinator of the 
Asian American Students' Association 
(AASA). "Sometimes you feel awkward 
because when they fmd out what na-
tionality you are they have to teU you how 
interested they are in it. If they are really 
interested, that's one thing, but when 
they feel like they have to talk about it 
because it's part of your heritage, it 
comes orr as really patronizing." 

Sometimes people of color see scorn in 
someone's eyes. Other times they go ig-
nored in public by a white person who 
talks with them in private, or,just the op-
posite, they are shown off in pubHc as a 
white person's "minority friend." "You 
can teU when someone is sincere," Ayala 
said. "Sometimes you get the feeling peo-
ple are looking at you as if you're a 
subhuman, or people will come up to you 
to talk about something, and you'U feel it 
like an undercurrent, like there are cer-
tain things they're not saying in their 
questions. It's ridiculous! We know we're 
people! We're not asking to be treated 
better than anybody else. We're asking to 
be treated with respect and looked upon 
as human beings." 

I'm sick of filling in your gaps
Sick of being your insurance against
The isolation of your self-imposed limitations
Sick of being the crazy of your holiday dinners
Sick of being the odd one of your Sunday brunches
Sick of being the sole Black friend to 30 individual
white people
Find another ammunition to fight
Fill of your world
Find something else to bring you together
Find some other way to be cool, peaceful and hip

The major cultural houses on cam-
pus- Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano 
de Aztlan (MEChA), Despierta Boricua 
(DB, the Puerto Rican house), AASA 
and 
the 
Afro-Am Center-provide 
essential support for people of color at 
Yale. The houses attract speakers, show 
films and exhibits, put out publications, 
have meals where they prepare foods of 
their cultures and throw parties where 
people generally dance more and drink 
less than at SAC parties. 

"The Afro-Am Center is the only place 
where black students come and don't feel 
in the minority," Jackson said. "A white 
person coming here feels in the minority, 
but imagine Hving your daily life like that. 
After a while maybe you quit noticing it, 
but it doesn't stop hurting, exhausting 
debilitating you. 
The Center 
energizes and resuscitates people. They 
can take leadership roles here and be 
creative. Their cultural experience is 
primary and not secondary and does not 
need to be explained. The Center is 
meant to afftrm ourselves, not to exclude 
white people, but I think that's the only 
way some people can deal with it, sadly 
enough." 

The cultural houses serve as havens of 
warmth and strength for many people of 
color, but women of color must make 
special efforts to cope with a world that 
imposes both racist and sexist stereotypes 
upon them. Yamashiro explained people 
are surprised when an Asian American 
male breaks the stereotype of passivity 
and quietness, but they usually attribute 
his success to his self-assured qualities as 
an American male. "Asian women are 
seen as extremely passive, submissive, non-
descript, following two or three paces 
behind their husbands," Yamashiro said. 
"Most of the Asian American women I 
know consider our identity distinct from 
the Asian woman stereotype, because of 
our level of education, our involvement in 
the women's movement and our drive for 
independence and personal fulfillment. 
Yet when we assert ourselves people 
react even more strongly to us, because 
we are opposing the stereotyped picture." 

Some white men believe the stereo-
types portraying women of color as 
passive, exotic or sensual. Women of col-
or, nonetheless, often remain closet girl-
friends. 

Michelle, 
'86, 
an 
Asian 
woman who preferred not to use her real 
name, recalled her relationship with a 
white student at Yale. "I went out with 
this real jock who thought I was someone 
he could see just every so often. He didn't 
want to show me to his white friends. I 
felt as if I was dating two people. On the 
outside he was real jocky and one of the 
guys and with me he was fine, really 
sweet and considerate. After months of 
dealing with this I felt I had really hurt 
myself. I told him, 'Look, you really have 
a problem because you're white and I'm 
Asian and you can't deal with it. I'm not

here to teach you and I'm not going to 
take you through it.' I told him one day 
he would have to choose which person he 
wanted to be and he said he really felt he 
had to be tough for people to accept 
him.'' 

Black women, who far outnumber 
black men at Yale, find the dating situa-
tion frustrating. Yet if they date white 
men they risk the label "mallomar"- a 
chocolate covered marshmallow, white 
on the inside. Asian women in the same 
situation are sometimes called "twinkies" 
or "bananas." Many women of color must 
come to terms with the "brown paper bag 
syndrome" in which the woman believes 
she is more beautiful if her features are 
European and her skin lighter than a 
brown paper bag. 

Women of color use many different 
strategies to handle race and gender 
issues. When Yamashiro first went to 
AASA it was a predominantly male 
organization. A group of AASA women 
had difficulty finding a means of expres-
sion and left to form their own support 
group. "This year as editor of The Asian 
American Journal at Yale I encourage Asian 
women to express their views in the 
magazine," Yamashiro said, "because a 
lot of Asian men need to be sensitized to 
feminist viewpoints. The Asian American 
Journal is more neutral than Aurora, which 
most men won't touch." 

While Yamashiro works within AASA, 
some women of color have formed sup-
port groups separate from the major, 
cultural organizations. 
The 
Black 
Undergraduate Women's Group, 
created in 1981, serves as a strong sup-
port network for about 15 members. 
Latina Perspectives, active in the '70s, 
has periodically tried to revive itself, but 
some Latina women worry that the 
group will further fragment an already 
small Latin population on campus. 

Of leaving to remind you
To breathe,
Show you suffer,
You your own self,
Your own self suffer,
Your own self,
For all your own suffering,

Although all women face the problem of 
silence, women of color often feel more 
reluctant to speak out because of a con-
spicuousness they sense in social situations 
and predominantly white classrooms. 
Take the example of a Women's Studies 
class which had a section on women of col-
or. Referring to a novel, the professor ask-
ed, "How does this black woman feel?" 
Many people turned to look at the only 
black woman in the room. Of course she 
could not speak for all black women, but 
many women of color feel pressured to act 
as spokespeople for entire races. 

Silence can paralyze a woman of color in 
her daily life. When asked what silence 
meant to her, Ayala replied, "It means be-
ing choked. It means not being heard 
even when you do open your mouth and 
words come out. It means my existence. 
It's what we are, and not always by choice. 
When it is my choice, usually it's a means 
of survival. Sometimes it's giving up and 
saying, 'I'm not going to make a difference 
anyway.' Sometimes it's just trying to stay 
alive with your mind intact." 

Former editor of Aurora, Catherine Liu, 
BK '85, an Asian woman who comes from 
a wealthy, predominantly white suburb, 
tries to fight silence as best she can. 
"There's so much to be done. There is 
racism and sexism on every front- in the 
media, film, literature, everywhere-and 
you can really begin to despair," Liu said. 
"But you have to try to fulfill what is possi-
ble for you. Don't try to shoot the moon, 
because I don't think that's politically effec-
tive. Just affirm what you have and what 
you can do. You may think, 'Okay, my 
friend has made a racist comment. Should 
I say anything or do anything? I mean, 
that won't change the world.' But it's 
available to you! You have a mouth, you 
can talk! This is what you can do and 
you've got to do it." 

Liu has worked actively in the Women's 
Center, unlike many women of color who 
believe women unsympathetic to their 
concerns dominate the Center. "There 
are many women there who don't realize 
a lot of things they do are based on the 
privilege of being white and wealthy," 
Liu said. "It's been incredibly frustrating 
and after a certain point you think, 'Am I 
committed 
to sticking around here 
despite the fact I know there are all these 
things wrong with it?' Then you realize 
you've made a commitment and you're 
going to stick it out. Maybe by just 
being there you've made a statement." 

Women of color can break the silence 
not only in campus organizations, but 
also in classrooms and social situations. 
Unfortunately, all people of color will 
probably have to continue explaining 
themselves 
to the dominant 
white 
culture, but if the white community does 
not listen, then voices fade in silence and 
misunderstandings continue.

I'm glad I must live
Is the bridge broken? Don't you know?
I must leave today
My own friend
Madras,
My own self, taken,
I must leave the bridge to nowhere
But my truth will
Rapidly die
I will leave useful

"A discussion of sexual 
politics has to go 
beyond the question 
of who you sleep 
with." 
28 The New JoumaiiMarch I, 1985 
Feminist Voices 
Anne Applebaum 
«TalJc to mry worrum a1 Yale andyou'U. hear a sflJry, a sflJry ahout being a worrum a1 
Yale, and how thai isn'tlik being a rrum at Yale. The more women you talJc to, the 
more sflJries you'U. hear."' 
Feminism at Yale does not exist in one place in the way the Philosophy 
Department resides in Connecticut Hall or the H istory Department in 
the Hall of Graduate Studies. Noli can it be defmed as one unified 
ideology or set of beliefs. Yet because feminist politics and activism do 
not have an official voice in the University, cliches and stereotypes are 
often employed to describe the opinions and positions of Yale feminists. 
The two most visible women's organizations, Aurora, Yale's feminist 
magazine, and the Yale Women's Center, have suffered from particular-
ly harsh characterizations. Although neither claims to represent all 
feminists or all women at Yale, both have been accused in the past of 
taking a crudely ideological approach to women's issues. They have been 
called monolithic, extremist and too radical for Yale to take seriously. 
Yet one can hear as many reasons for participation in Women's 
Center activities as there are participants and as many reasons for 
editing and writing for Aurora as there are editors and writers. Nadia 
Tchao, OC '84, who is co-editor of Aurora this semester, asked, "I wonder 
whether we shouldn't stop talking about feminism and start talking about 
feminisms." 

It would have been difficult for Aurora to have indoctrinated Tchao, 
and co-editor Minona Yin, DC '85, into any specific set of beliefs, 
because neither had been heavily committed to the magazine before this 
semester. Yin had never been to an Aurora meeting, and Tchao had been 
to only a few. Both, however, had previously been involved in publishing 
Diakcts, an Asian American women's magazine that appeared as a sup-
plement to Aurora last spring. Because of Aurords non-hierarchical, 
cooperative structure, such personnel changes are not uncommon to the 
magazine and are even encouraged. Tchao says her decision to edit 
Aurora stems in part from her desire to inject it with new ideas. She ex-
plained, "An integral part of feminism is its constant reevaluation of itself 
and constant redefmition of its own terms. Feminists have to question 
themselves in the same way they question the assumptions of others." 
Tchao recognizes her desire to bring new perspectives to Aurora may 
not necessarily lead to a new reception for the magazine on campus. She 
explained, "Both the community that does read Aurora and the com-
munity that doesn't already think they know what Aurora is. It's hard to 
struggle out of that kind of framework." Since its first appearance as a 
supplement to Zirkus in 1979, and its fll'st official publication in 1980, 
Aurora has been labelled a "dyke magazine" and an extremist publication. 
One article it printed four years ago provoked accusations that the 
magazine's editors were "man-haters." 


Tchao 
believes 
people 
resort to these harsh characterizations 
because "It's easy. It's easy to write 
something off as extremist, to label it and 
dismiss it, since then you don't have to 
listen to what it's saying." Aurords art 
editor, Liz Schindler, DC '85, added, 
"It's especially easy to ignore something 
that looks on the outside like it doesn't 
have a lot of power or money behind it." 
Tchao and Schindler dislike placing 
strict definitions on their own feminism 
just as they dislike the glib defmitions so 
often assigned to Aurora. Tchao ex-
plained, "I'm always hesitant to use the 
word radical because it might not mean the 
same thing to the person l'm talking to as 
it does to me." Instead Tchao prefers to 
think of feminism as a process of ques-
tioning traditional assumptions, both her 
own and others. "It comes down to the 
problem of understanding power hierar-
chies, and recognizing your place in 
them," she stated. "To realize the way 
the world works is to realize where you fit 
into that world in terms of power , and 
who's controlling the structure of things. 
Then you might want to ask if that struc-
ture is one you really want to be a part 
of." 
Since the magazine's inception, one of 
Aurords main objectives has been to 
maintain a constant process of question-
ing both itself and the Yale community. 
J essica Peaslee, DC '86, has been on 
Aurords staff for two years and observed, 
"The magazine's tone changes every 
semester, 
because the 
magazine's 
philosophy gets 
redefined 
every 
semester." Susan Moon, DC '86, who 
also works on the magazine's staff, ex-
plained , "A urora is very conscious of the 
information it puts out, and of how peo-
ple will read it." 
Tchao offers her Yale education as 
another example of how one might learn 
to reexailline assumptions. "Yale has ex-
posed me to what is possible in the world 
and yet at the same time has shown me 
what is not possible for me because I'm 
not white and I'm not male. Yale has 
made me painfully aware of who I am 
and who I am not." Schindler has a dif-
ferent memory of becoming a feminist. 
30 The New journal/March I, 1985 
She explained, "I never questioned that I 
had the same opportunities as a man, 
and becoming more 'radical' hasn't been 
that big a shift; I've just gained a better 
understanding of things. Feminism has 
made me aware of how people's lives 
have been shaped by roles that have 
already been set up, and I don't want my 
life to be regulated by a series of pre-
existing standards. I want to direct it 
myself, and maybe to go beyond the 
structure of society as it is already set up. 
Paradoxically," she explained, "Yale has 
given me the language to criticize the 
values that it stands for as an institution." 
Unlike Tchao, Sylvia Brownrigg, SY 
'86, began working for Aurora at the 
beginning of her freshman year. By the 
second semester she had become one of 
the magazine's co-editors. Brownrigg ex-
plained that her original attraction to the 
magazine "had to do with the strength 
and powerful convictions of the women 
who were involved. I saw people working 
hard to communicate their ideas. and 
beliefs to other people." Brownrigg does 
not believe the women running Aurora 
and the Women's Center are less com-
mitted now than they were three years 
ago, but does agree the magazine's tone 
has changed in that period of time. 
"When I f1rst carne here," she said, "I 
perceived the lesbian feminist crowd as 
being pretty formative of a lot of the 
feminist politics around here, and I don't 
think that's true anymore." Brownrigg at-
tributes this change partly to the fact that 
gay issues have become more familiar to 
the Yale community than they were in 
the past. "It's not so unusual to be gay 
now, whereas I think five years ago the 
lesbian community was very set apart 
from the rest of the student body." 
Brownrigg does question how deep this 
acceptance runs. "I heard recently that a 
group held an anti-GLAD dance this 
year; so there continues to !:>e a need for a 
lesbian feminist voice at Yale." 
Brownrigg ridicules accusations that 
Aurora was ever an exclusively lesbian 
publication. She points out that although 
the staff has always consisted of gay and 
straight men and women, the magazine's 
re·adership persists in defming the entire 
magazine by its most radical articles, 
often not even reading the others. In the 
Fall 1983 issue, Brownrigg and the 
magazine's other editors consciously at-
tempted to present a broad range of 
issues and ideas aimed at many different 
men and women at Yale. A subsequent 
review in the Yale Daily NewJ panned the 
¢Jltire issue. Brownrigg recalled, "The 
author implied that the inclusion of a 
vocal lesbian politics in one part of the 
magazine meant Aurora would be in-
teresting only to lesbians and that straight 
women would be too threatened to read 
it. 
"People fmd what they want to fmd in 
Aurora. In one editorial 
I 
talked, 
metaphorically' about skin touching other 
skin; the article was making a point about 
race. A friend of mine asked me why I'd 
had to write so explicitly about lesbian 
sexuality-which was not at all the point 
of the article. 
"In any case," Brownrigg continued, 
"there are some ways in which I'm 
vulnerable as a gay woman that are not 
the same as for my straight friends, but 
the broadest range of feminist concerns 
apply equally to straight and gay women. 
A discussion of sexual politics has to go 
beyond the question of who you sleep 
with and begin discussing the exchange of 
power that goes on between any two peo-
ple who are sexually involved." She 
agrees with Tchao and Schindler in 
observing, "People seem to want to link 
Aurora to lesbianism because then they 
think it doesn't apply to them. Fem inism 
encourages both men and women to 
make changes in their everyday lives, and 
I think people are afraid of that." 
As for accusations that Aurora excludes 
men, Brownrigg replied, "I don't feel 
feminism excludes men any more than 
race politics exclucle white people. I think 
some men may feel threatened by 
feminism because it's trying to change 
the status quo. On the other hand," she 
added, "there are men who are sensitive 
to feminist issues on an individual level 
who fmd that feminist politics on a mass 
level excludes them. When someone 
starts talking about masculine values or 
masculine 
structures~ 
they feel

Women's Work at Yale Wins Respect 
By Lucinda Finley 
The contract ratified last week between Yale University 
and Local34 of the Federation of University Employees represents 
one of the most successful forays to date by the labor movement 
into women-dominated sectors of the white-collar work force. 

Most unions have devoted insufficient attention to organizing 
white-collar workers, and when they have attempted to do so they 
have often failed to adapt their message to the needs of women. 
They have also met with resistance from white-collar 
employees who do not want to be associated with a male-and blue-
collar oriented organization. The Yale union adopted from the 
outset a grassroots, democratic approach, with the seeds of the 
organization coming from within. The union's agenda came from 
the workers, so the union was sensitive to the concerns of the 
largely female work force. 

The clerical workers felt that they were not getting the respect 
or recompense that they deserved for their contribution to the 
educational enterprise at Yale. 

This low status was evidenced by wages far lower than the male 
blue-collar workers' wages and insufficient to support a family, a 
salary structure that kept women clustered in low labor grades and 
gave no rewards for longevity of service, a meager pension plan and 
often disdainful treatment by administrators and supervisors. 

The contract addresses each of these concerns, through an 
across-the-board wage increase, a system of salary step increase for 
years of service at Yale, significant improvement in the pension 
formula, and procedures for reviewing job classifications, promotions 
and layoffs. 

The contract is the culmination of a union's efforts to address 
the issue of comparable worth. At Yale, administrative assistants 
who ran entire departments and lab technicians responsible for 
experiments conducted under valuable grants often earned less 
than the mostly male workers who drive trucks and perform 
maintenance services for Yale. 

According to the union, the salary disparities existed, not 
because their jobs were less important or entailed less responsibility, 
but because their jobs have traditionally been viewed as women's 
work. 

Economics professor Raymond...? performed a statistical 
analysis that suggested salary disparities across job rankings 
between women and minorities and other workers, disparities that 
could not be explained away by factors such as differences in 
education, years of service, and job responsibility. 

Not only will the across-the-board salary increases in the Yale 
contract bring the salaries in male and female job categories closer 
together, but the provision for annual increases is designed to 
bring the salaries of currently undervalued workers more in line 
with their actual responsibilities and professional development. 

All of this has been achieved without 
reducing the salaries in the predominantly 
male job categories. 

All of this has been achieved without reducing the salaries in 
the predominantly male job categories, thus calling into question 
the stock retort that any comparable worth wage gain for women 
workers will have to come at the expense of men. 

But could the debilitating 10-week strike have been avoided? 
If, after weeks of insisting that it could not spare another penny, Yale 
finally found more to give in the waning days before the deadline 
for a second strike, why couldn't it have made these proposals in 
September? 

Some members of the union negotiating team testified to a 
markedly different attitude displayed by the university negotiators in 
the past few weeks, an attitude evincing a palpable desire to achieve 
an agreement. 

Despite public pronouncements by the Yale administration that 
the educational process was not being hampered, many of us who 
are an integral part of that process know that the contrary is true. 
Many classes, including most at the law school, were moved off 
campus to locations of varying inconvenience. Class time was lost 
as students shuttled around town. 

My classes in labor law and torts, for example, were held in an 
office building near the Palace Theater on College Street in New 
Haven, with construction noises outside the window. I also taught in 
the living room of a peace organization, complete with chairs in 
various stages of losing their springs and stuffing and two large cats 
that insisted on climbing on my shoulders every time I was about to 
make a serious point. We quickly moved out of there. 

Those whose classes remained on campus found that some 
students would not attend rather than engage in the crisis of 
conscience of crossing a picket line. Thus, some students had a 
semester on tape, a diversity of views was missing from the 
classroom, and classes were polarized along largely political lines. 

The interchange of ideas, formal and informal, that is so 
important to the scholarly and educational process, broke down. 
Speakers and workshops were canceled. With no dining halls, and 
classes scattered, opportunities for students to see each other and to 
see faculty were limited. The few hallway or streetcorner 
encounters with colleagues that did occur focused on the strike, 
rather than on scholarly ideas. 

In some departments, junior faculty and teaching assistants 
reported that they had been pressured not to take actions that could 
be viewed as supportive of the union. Many faculty members now 
doubt whether Yale is seriously committed to the principles of 
open exchange of ideas and academic freedom that it espoused in 
its public communications during the strike. 

One can only hope that the administration learns from the 
demoralizing experience of the strike. As a professor of labor 
relations law, I was sometimes dismayed by the way the process was 
conducted. 

At the outset of negotiations, the rumor was that the university 
team was not taking the workers' concerns seriously, and was not 
making much of an effort to respond to proposals. 

I attended several negotiating sessions last spring and summer 
as a faculty observer, and what I saw verified the rumors. At the first 
session, I detected an audible expression of relief from some 
members of the university negotiating team that there were no 
faculty members in attendance. That day the observers' chairs were 
all occupied by women. The negotiators' faces looked startled 
when, at the day's end, I introduced myself as a law professor and 
two other young women identified themselves as faculty members. 

Throughout other sessions, the university team met every 
union proposal not with discussion, but with "we'll have to get back 
to you on that." They did not get back on most issues. 

This is not too surprising, since the administration did not send 
anyone into the negotiating room with the authority to commit Yale 
until the last few weeks. This is a cardinal mistake in labor 
negotiations. In order to achieve a contract each side has to have at 
the table a representative who has the authority to agree and to offer 
compromises or to make counteroffers that can be fulfilled. 

The administration committed another labor negotiations mistake 
by taking a strong public stance against binding arbitration. Yale 
also publicly committed itself to its late September offer as its final 
offer. When either side in a labor negotiation takes its positions 
beyond the table to the public as an absolute, it is often left with little 
or no room to compromise. Saving face can sometimes become 
more important than settling a contract. 

One can only hope that the lessons learned from the strike will 
be lasting and that Yale's sorry history of strikes to achieve labor 
contracts will end. Unions do not necessarily mean an end to 
stability, productivity and harmony in a work force. Indeed, recent 
scholarly empirical work demonstrates that it is often management's 
response to unions that is more determinative of work-place 
dynamics than the mere presence of the union. 

A management that is disdainful to union representatives, that 
fails to explain its concerns and deal with theirs, even after a union 
has won an election, may only produce for itself an embittered work 
force that is all the more willing to use economic pressure. 

Yale, however, can be considered a winner in this labor 
dispute. Indeed, the university should be proud, as an institution 
seeking new solutions to societal problems, to have concluded a 
contract that represents a gain in dignity, wage comparability and 
power over their own working lives for traditionally under-
appreciated and undervalued women white-collar workers.

The members of Local35 and Local34 at Yale deeply appreciate the support 
of the community in our recent struggles. We could not have been successful 
without that support. 

Fair settlements would not have been 
achieved without the concern and hard work of 
so many Yale students, faculty members, 
managerial and professional employees, alumni, 
parents, chaplains, and others in the Yale 
community, and so many in the labor 
movement, community organizations, the clergy 
(especially the Association of New Haven 
Clergy), the women's movement, and many 
members of both the New Haven Board of 
Aldermen and the state legislative delegation 
from the Greater New Haven area. 

literally thousands of people from all walks 
of life, locally and nation-wide, helped in large 
and small ways. We hope that we do not offend 
those thousands if we mention by name, 
because their behind-the-scenes efforts toward a 
settlement have not been publicized, 
Congressman Bruce Morrison and his staff, who 
worked tirelessly to persuade both parties to 
compromise, and Senator Lowell Weicker. 

We believe that our success benefits the 
entire community. Everyone, including the Yale 
administration, is a winner when an important 
part of the community gains new respect. 

In Local 35, the achievement of strong job 
security, and preference for hiring and 
subcontracting at Yale for minorities and 
women, will contribute to the economic 
progress of the people of Greater New Haven. 
Yale, as New Haven's largest employer, has 
historically set a low salary standard for clerical 
and technical employees, and so the significant 
beginning Local 34 has made toward economic 
equality will benefit many in this area, and 
perhaps nationwide. The substantial increases 
for both Unions in pension benefits, and in 
medical protection for retirees, will help end 
Yale's role as a contributor to poverty among 
the elderly in New Haven. 

The whole community is also a winner if 
the Yale Corporation finally sees the need to 
develop a constructive labor relations policy and 
a fair approach to collective bargaining. If that 
turns out to be true, the community can be 
spared the incalculable costs, and the turmoil 
and division, of the 16-year history of labor 
strife at Yale. 

Nationally, our success will provide hope to 
the millions of others resisting the anti-worker 
offensive by managements today, and especially 
to working women and minorities determined 
to end economic discrimination in America. 

We are using this way of thanking all those 
who supported us directly, and all those who 
contributed to ensuring that the strike would 
not resume, because we cannot hope to thank 
each of you individually. 

To all of you: thanks!

mediately implicated, 
which isn't 
necessarily true. Men don't have to be 
trapped in roles they don't want any 
more than women do." 

Karin Cope, BK '85-, remembered 
being afraid to go into the Women's 
Center her freshman year. "I had this 
abstract fear that if I walked in, something 
was going to happen. I don't know what," 
she said. "Maybe they would just ask me 
some hard questions." Cope is the 
1984-85 
co-coordinator of Women's 
Center activities, which this semester in-
clude investigations into the problem of 
sexual harassment and the lack of 
tenured women faculty. The Women's 
Center also schedules time for meetings 
of the Women's Political Caucus, Yales-
bians, the Feminist Film Society and 
Aurora. It publishes From the Center, a bi-
weekly newsletter, and Cope plans to 
organize coalitions among the various 
women's groups on campus and other 
organizations. 

Last semester's strike 
closed the Center, but Cope hopes it can 
begin "maintaining a feminist voice on 
campus," 
by bringing in speakers, 
holding forums and writing editorials in 
campus publications. Cope adds that the 
Center contains a library of books 
relating to women's issues and provides a 
place where anyone can find people who 
have thought a lot about feminism and 
about the kinds of effects it can have on 
their lives. Cope believes the Center 
also fills a more symbolic function: "Most 
of us need to go back only one generation 
to realize the huge difference between 
what our mothers did or thought they 
could do and what we expect in our lives. 
So there's a need right now for institu-
tions that both preserve the memory of 
the past and do something towards fulfill-
ing those new expectations." 

The Yale Women's Center has not 
always been a familiar fixture on the Yale 
campus. It dates back to the early 1960s 
when it was called the New Haven 
Women's Liberation Center and had of-
fices in a small Yale-owned building on 
Park Street. The University terminated 
its lease in 1972, Cope alleged, because 
the women who ran it engaged in too 
much activism and protest. In 1976 six 
undergraduate women petitioned the

University for a "women's space," which 
was fmally created in the basement of 
Hendrie Hall. The Women's Center 
moved to its present location on Elm 
Street only five years ago, the same year 
Aurora ftrst appeared as an independent 
publication. 

When Cope reflected upon her earlier 
reluctance 
to become 
involved 
in 
women's issuesL she concluded her change 
pf heart came from encountering intellec-
tual and social obstacles at Yale she had 
never run into before. Like many Yale 
women, Cope said, "I used to be a 
feminist without labeling myself that 
way, because I had feminist expectations 
about what was possible for me to do in 
the world. Now, my feminism has to do 
with a certain attitude, a coming to terms 
with my right to be angry, my right to 
fight for what I expect." She has talked to 
many alumnae who had nothing to do 
with the Women's Center when they 
were here. "When they left Yale, tried to 
get jobs, tried to get paid, tried to buy 
cars, tried to get credit, but couldn't 
because they weren't married, they 
changed their 
m inds and 
called 
themselves feminists." 

Cope is often asked what the purpose 
of the Women's Center is and has no 
trouble 
simply 
stating, "Yale 
gives 
women a superficial and sometimes false 
sense of equality, but women have the 
same 
problems here they do 
anywhere else. Women at Yale are 
beaten, sexually harassed and raped. 
Someone has to make the University deal 
with these problems. If there wasn't an 
advocate for women's issues on campus, 
a lot of those questions would be allowed 
to disappear." She also described some 
more subtle reasons why women at Yale 
might need a space dedicated solely to 
their needs. "There are whole systems of 
protection set up for men here where 
women don't neces~arily have a place, in-
stitutions here that women cannot be a 
part of. Actually, we have a joke that 
goes, 'the University 
is the 
men's 
center."' 

Bernice Hausman, TC '84, now co-
coordinator of the Women's Political 
Caucus, had a different kind of first en-
counter with the Women's Center.


**Page number(s): 35**

Hausman became involved in Women's 
Center projects her freshman year 
because she was impressed with the 
discussions she heard there. "I had never 
before come into contact with people talk-
ing so honestly about sexual, personal 
and political issues." Hausman ran the 
ERA task force for the Women's Political 
Caucus her sophomore year but remain-
ed dissatisfied with the atmosphere she 
found at Yale. She took the next year ofT, 
"mainly to get a sense of myself as a 
woman outside of a male place like Yale." 
Hausman had been frustrated with the 
absence or paucity of women in some of 
her courses and disappointed with the 
classes she took that did deal specifically 
with women. "There are some very 
superficial ways of discussing women's 
issues, ways that overlook some of the 
real problems. Sometimes everyone's so 
willing to agree, real discussion peters 
out." 

Hausman remembers one class in par-
ticular where she observed "bad feelings 
between the white women in the class 
and the women of color, feelings that 
were never expressed until the last day of 
class." 

Hausman 
thinks 
her 
misunderstandings about the problem of 
race in the women's movement confused 
her own defmition of feminism. She now 
believes, "It's easy for white women to 
say we should all organize together, 
because we want everyone in our group, 
and it's hard for us to see that a lot of the 
concerns are very different for women of 
different backgrounds and racial iden-
tities." 

. Since the beginning of the women's 
movement, the issue of race has initiated 
much controversy. Brownrigg noted, "In 
the early days, women's rights activists 
believed we had to present a united front 
to get anything done. Now I think we've 
come to the point where we can afford to 
question ourselves on that issue, and this 
has recently become a very important 
concern for feminists at Yale." Hausman 
recognizes that the Women's Political 
Caucus consists predominantly of white 
women, but she believes, "The thing to 
do is to form coalitions around certain 
issues we can work on together, while 
recognizing that our existence and status 
at Yale are very different. One has to 
respect that difference, understand that 
difference and state that difference con-
stantly in order to remain aware of it." 

This awareness of difference, not a 
consciousness of ideological or personal 
similarity, is ironically the most obvious 
link between different kinds of feminist 
beliefs and politics at Yale. Thus Nadia 
Tchao believes feminism is destined to 
become a "sometimes uncomfortable 
plurality." Bernice Hausman believes 
feminism will have to learn to provide 
"more guidance, more understanding of 
what it means to be a woman at Yale. 
There aren't any models out there, and 
there are never going to be any that 
everyone can use," and Karin Cope 
speaks about helping women to fulfill 
feminist expectations. At Yale, women's 
organizations have been haunted by 
stereotypes and condemnatory labels, 
and yet the women who write for 
feminist publications and who give their 
time to women's political and social issues 
share no unifying principle, not even a 
simple definition of the word "feminism." 

But even if feminist politics now holds 
itself responsible for an enormous range 
of issues, from sexual harassment to 
racial discrimination, Liz Schindler still 
believes, "There's something we can do 
besides sinking into despair after we 
realize how remote are other people's ex-
periences from our own." Along these 
lines, Sylvia Brownrigg concluded, "I 
don't know how much of what goes on in 
the Women's Center has an outside ef-
fect or changes people's opinions, but by 
being visible we show the rest of the Yale 
community that problems exist, and peo-
ple exist who are very willing to devote 
time and effort towards eradicating 
them."

Seeing with New Eyes 
Pam Thompson 
"There are huge 
silences, great 
yawning gaps in our 
knowledge of women's 
place in history." 
36 The New joumal/March I, 1985 
Tucked in the corner of a parking lot between College and Temple 
Streets stands a small yellow building. Across its walls an unknown graf-
fiti artist has scrawled "there is no justice, just us" in red spray paint. 
Despite its 
nondescript appearance this little building has a 
name-Corbey Court-and a functi6n. It houses Yale's Affirmative Ac-
tion Office and the Women's Studies Program. 

For most Yale students, women's studies is as peripheral academically 
as its office is architecturally. Many probably have not reached the back 
of the Blue Book to examine the department's listings. Many more have 
never thought of women's studies as a discipline and, if pressed, reveal 
they do not really understand its purpose. But for those professors and 
students involved in women's studies it is not at all peripheral, it is of cen-
tral importance. Liz Carver, SM '85, a Women's Studies major, suggests 
it means "reorganizing the entire way you look at the world." According 
to Helene Wenzel, director of undergraduate studies (DUS) of the pro-
gram, she and others have viewed 
women's studies as "an 
epistemological revolution within the hallowed halls of higher education." 

The history of the development of women's studies at Yale is not, 
however, one of sudden revolutionary change, but of gradual academic 
institutionalization. "When women arrived at Yale, feminism and 
women's studies were beginning to be very visible political and academic 
concerns," said Margaret Homans, acting chair of the program. During 
the first five years of coeducation, departments responded to the 
pressures of student demand and current scholarship by offering scat-
tered courses focusing on women. At the time, half of the fewer than 10 
courses directly involving women's concerns were offered through the 
Residential College Seminar program. In 1977, Yale College sponsored 
its first interdisciplinary, introductory course in women's studies. During 
the following summer term, the College offered 10 courses as an experi-
mental Women's Studies Program. That year the Yale College Commit-
tee on the Education of Women (successor to the original University 
Committee on Coeducation) proposed the permanent establishment of 
the program .md the faculty approved it in May 1979. With the pro-
gram's inception the number of courses focusing on women in other 
departments almost doubled. 

According to the program's grant proposal, the founders of Women's 
Studies at Yale conceived it to be a response to the intellectual needs for 
both more information about women's lives and contributions and the 
revision of existing theories which make sense only of men's experience. 
Five years after the program's establishment these basic needs are still 
evident.

**Title: The Tenure Gap**
**Author: Lina Kelly**
**Page number(s): 39**

When Associate Professor of English 
and Comparative Literature Margie 
Ferguson served as a resident advisor in 
Morse in the early years of coeducation, 
she heard many complaints from 
women students who felt part of a 
minority on display. "I think it was 
partly through hearing them articulate 
their problems that I came to under-
stand how one feels as a minority on the 
faculty here," said Ferguson, who 
earned a graduate degree at Yale. 
If, as according to some, the quality 
of life for tenured women professors is 
satisfactory, why have over 20 percent 
of the women given tenure by Yale left 
for positions elsewhere? Yet if women 
comprise half of the new term appoint-
ments in the humanities, 
is 
this 
evidence of sexual discrimination? 
Since the release of last year's Crothers 
Report on the status of tenured women 
at Yale, debates regarding the female 
faculty continue. 
The report stated that in the past six 
years the number of tenured women 
faculty has increased by one position. 
while a total of 17 tenured positions 
were filled. Of Yale's 32 academic 
departments, only 12 have tenured 
women. If current trends in 
the 
humanities continue, the number of 
tenured women would not match the 
doctoral pool until 2024. 
"At the moment prospects are nil [for 
more tenured women) in our depart-
ment, and there probably won't be any 
for another three to four years unless 
the University grants new tenured posi-
tions," said Sophia Simmonds. director 
of undergraduate studies in Molecular 
Biology and Biophysics. 
"Every place I've been tenured. I've 
been the only woman," said Ruth Mar-
cus, professor of philosophy. She re-
called graduate schools with a total of 
three to five women students. "You 
couldn't even compute the percentage of 
them," she said. "But it could be 50 per-
cent in another few years." The pool of 
women graduating with Ph.D's is used 
to gauge a reasonable figure for women 
in tenure track positions. Marcus men-
tioned that as of 1984. 43. 1 percent of 
doctoral candidates in 
comparative 
literature were female, while Yale had 
no tenured women in that department. 
For Yale's tenured women, increased 
TeSPQnsibilities and job security · are 
closely linked. According to Ferguson, 
the first woman professor promoted 
from the ranks of her department, "If 
you're a man you can afford to say, 'No, 
I don't have time to serve on this com-
mittee,' but if you're a woman and the 
dean calls and asks you to be on a c.:om-
mittee, often you want the woman's 
point of view heard." She described the 
time restrictions resulting from "being 
somewhat overcommitted to commit-
tees" and advising the many graduate 
students who want to work with her. 
"It's striking they're all women at the 
moment. There's some sexual channel-
ing there," she said. 
Linda Colley, a Cambridge graduate 
and one of the few female associate pro-
fessors in the History Department, 
noticed another form of channeling. 
"People are more likely to assume that 
because I'm female I tend to do 
women's history." 
"The really nasty thing about this 
system is that the years from the late 
teens until age 35 are taken by estab-
lishing oneself in the profession. Those 
are the childbearing years. One of the 
main accusations from men who don't 
think 
women 
should 
have more 
numbers is that women don't produce 
as much because they have more dis· 
tractions." 
According to the Crothers Report. in 
the next six years 60 tenure spots should 
open in the Faculty of Arts and 
Sciences. The Report's major recom-
mendation was to increase the number 
of tenured women to 30 by that time, 
doubling the present number. Recently 
the number of non-tenured women on 
the faculty increased, while the total size 
of the faculty decreased. Professor of 
English Marie Borroff, who received 
tenure in the early 1960s, spoke op· 
timistically about the results of the 
report. which 
she helped present. 
.. \\'e're all aware of the problem in the 
department, and given the quality of 
the nontenured women coming up. 
more and more women ought to get 
tenure.'" 
Simmonds, however, offered a word 
of caution to women planning to teach 
in her field: "The main thing I think 
women have to realize is, equal oppor· 
tunity laws or no, they've got to be a lit· 
tle bit better than their male <·om~ti­
tion."

**Seeking A New Tradition**
**Author: Melissa Turner**
**Page number(s): 41**

In the academic treatment of art, women 
cannot easily create their own traditions 
and 
follow 
new 
philosophies. 
Men 
exclusively have defined art is tic 
standards. The question then arises; with 
What artistic standards should the work 
and opinions of women artists be 
'analyzed? 
"I was always encoura~d to look at past 
an, but none of the artists inspired me. 
;rhey were all male. It has always 
bothered me that women artists have 
been overlooked. It bothers my art. It's 
hard to be inspired by a tradition that 
doesn't speak to you," said Dominique 
Dibbell, DC '86, a discouraged art m~jor 
who has taken the semester off to rethink 
her plans. 
She feels 
women artists do not 
necessarily subscribe to traditional views 
Of art. For instance, female and male 
painters approach painting the female 
nude in entirelv different wavs. \\!omen 
painters do oot depict the' archetypal 
female 
as their male counterparts 
might-but the latter's portrayal sets and 
follows tradition. 
Both Dibbell and Karen, '86, an artist 
who preferred 
not 
to be named, 
expressed 
frustration 
with 
the Art 
Department's painting program and its 
llack of focus on women in art history. Art 
fhistory books seldom acknowledge 
women artists, and frustration increases 
(because professors here very rarely 
'address that conspicuous absence. Stu· 
Clents are not referred to the work of 
women artists. "It would be impossible to 
talk to a teacher about how women's 
unagery might differ from men's or the 
difference a woman's consciousneo;c; might 
make. Most professors would be skeptical 
of making any such distinction," Karen 
said. Dibbell remembered when History 
Of Art Professor Robert Herbert took the 
time to research works of women artists in 
hia course "An in the Machine Age." 
re Dibbc.-11 gained inspiration from 
the work of an artist, a woman artist. 
These women assert the technical 
Philosophy of Yale's painting program is 
traditional and sometimes stifling. 
onnalism, the traditional approach, 
emphasizes the "grammatical" struc:ture 
Ol a painting over its subjecti,·e content, 
aid Roger Tibbets, director of 
undergraduate studies in the Art 
Department. Formalism stresses 
expn•ssion through the relationship of 
spc:cific colors and shapes rather than an 
explicit 
illustrative approach. "The 
overriding formalism here can be a bias 
against women artists who are conscious 
of themselves as such. If you're a woman 
artist in this time you have to be aware of 
yourself as a woman. You're deceiving 
yourself if you're not," Karen said. 
"Formalism stifles those who are feminillts 
and want to say something in their art 
because it concentrates so much on form 
that the content in the end is different 
from what one could get if the message 
were presented explicitly. The teachers 
would rather not discuss the content of 
the: work if it's political." 
However, according to Tibbets, 
formalism is not insensitive to con-
content, but creates the basis for its 
prest•ntation. He also does not view the 
art produced by '"umen as inherently 
different from that of men. But Karen 
objects to this belief. "There's not much 
spa(e to create S('lf-conscious women's art, 
but there's not much initiative on the 
students' part either," she said. "The issue 
doesn't arise because there is no reference 
to the• fact that you are a woman." 
Subtle 
bias~s imposed by an 
O\ crwhelmingly male 
faculty are 
im rnt'diately obvious but difficult to 
overcome ... The teachers can empathize 
with their male students better because in 
them they see themselves when they were 
student<:," Karen said. Some professors 
hold to traditional gender expectations 
and may expreo;s them in sexist language 
in lectures. 
One othetv. ise ambitious and en-
thusiastic sophomore architecture ma-
jor's dissatisfaction with the program 
stems from the language she hears in 
the: majority of her architecture classes. 
In them professors refer to .. man" as the 
"molder of space, the designer of space." 
wV\'ords conjure up images and the im-
ages are of something 111 never be: a 
man," she said. "As a woman. it is very 
hard to imagine myself in the position 
of 'man the dominator of space.' I feel 
out.,ide the image created for me."

**Title: Shared Obsessions**
**Author: Tina Kelley**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
"I have yet to have one Yale woman tell me she does not have a problem 
with food," said Dr. Francy Howland, New Haven psychiatrist and assis-
tant professor at the Yale Medical School. Eating disorders have reached 
epidemic proportions on most college campuses, and Yale is no excep-
tion. According to one estimate, between 35 and 65 percent of college-age 
women suffer from either anorexia (dieting and/or exercising to the point 
of starvation) or bulimia (overeating followed by self-induced vomiting). 

Although the medical origins of anorexia and bulimia remain 
unknown, victims of eating disorders at Yale attribute their diseases to 
three central factors: problems in their own mental health, pressures in 
the University environment, and a society which confmes them in un-
natural roles. 

Weighing 38 pounds more than she did two years ago, Laura looked 
trim and healthy in her layers of running clothes. She spoke with the in-
tensity of a coach who knows it is possible to win a marathon. Laura was 
an obligatory runner, an exercise addict. When an injury sophomore 
year kept her from running, she began dieting and exhibiting signs of 
anorexia. 

"At my worst, I was running four to eight miles in the morning, and 
eight to 12 at night. I saw someone in Mental Hygiene for five sessions. 
When I weighed 100 pounds, I thought I had a problem, but I tried to 
pretend I didn't. I said to him, 'I don't have a problem, do I?' and he said 
no. I walked out of there to my best cross country season ev~r. I made 
All-American, but I paid for it later. My running coach was concerned 
that I was running more than everyone else, but because I was achieving 
something it didn't seem like a mental illness, which in fact was what it 
was. No one thought I had a problem except me." 

When Laura realized she needed help, she took a term off and went 
into psychotherapy, where she gained a series of important insights. "My 
problem is not in my relation to food," she said. "My problem is in me. 
M y obsession with food let me hide that. If your main concern is eating 
and running, more threatening things like classes or getting a job become 
minimwn in importance. Food is something we can control. Many 
women talk of their eating disorders as something that 'happens,' 
something they have no control over. 

"You go in thinking your problem is with food and running, then in 
analysis you see it's really how you feel about yourself, and that takes a 
big adj ustment. The first is more real, the second is less controllable. 
Then you get used to the unsettledness, and you realize you're going to 
get to know yourself." Laura has been in therapy now for a year and a 
half, which she feels is unusually long, though most anorexics need at 
least a year of psychiatric treatment for every year of their disease. 

"They told me I looked 
great, I looked terrific 
and together. And I 
was falling apart inside."

and absence of women directly affect the 
size, strength, and longevity of any 
women's studies enterprise, anywhere in 
the world." Wenzel is actually the only 
Yale faculty member to have a partial ap-
pointment in Women's Studies. Others 
who teach Women's Studies classes have 
appointments in other departments. 
"This means Women's Studies relies 
upon faculty to whom it can't dictate- it 
relies upon ~ 
will," Chessman said. 
"Ideally," asserted Wilson, "Women's 
Studies should link to the issue of tenur-
ing women." 
The scarcity of tenured women on 
campus reminds feminists involved in 
Women's Studies that 15 years of coeduca-
tion is not a very long time in a place with 
century-old traditions. "This is a conser-
vative University-even though it's coed 
now it bears the traces of its original 
form-a university for men," Chessman 
said. The Women's Studies Program 
resides in a somewhat "precarious posi-
tion," within this University, according to 
Carver. "Women's Studies is trying to 
make a place for itself but somehow it is 
always on the edge. It tries to be a part of 
academia and yet questions traditional 
scholarship. Trying to be in two positions 
at once isn't easy." Wenzel agrees. "I see 
feminism and women's studies in par-
ticular as having to be out of necessity an 
'enclave of outsiders' on the inside, work-
ing constantly toward the transformation 
of that very inside space." 
Virginia Woolf spoke about just that 
"enclave of outsiders" in her 7hree 
Guitws. She might have been talking 
about Yale's Women's Studies Program 
when she described the college that the 
"outsiders"-the women-should found. 
"It is young and poor; let it therefore take 
advantage of those qualities and be 
founded on poverty and youth . . . . Let 
it be built on lines of its own. It must not 
be built of carved stone and stained 
glass

"I'm exhilarated and fascinated by the 
self-knowledge I've gained, so I stay in 
it," she said. "In some ways I'm glad I 
had the problem because I learned 
about myself, but sometimes I think 
there's got to be a better way." 


As her therapy progressed 
Laura 
returned to a normal weight. "Getting 
better is hard," she admitted. "First of 
all, it's much easier to lose weight 
because then you feel directly good 
about your body. When you gain 
weight 
you 
feel 
horrible, 
though 
everyone says, 'Isn't it wonderful? 
You're getting better!' No, you're get-
ting fat." She seemed to spit the word 
out. 


While most anorexics or bulimics at 
Yale have suffered from the diseases for 
seven or eight years. se,·eral believe that 
the roots of their problems lie not only 
in themselves but also in the University 
environment. "Anorexia is a manifesta-
tion of a larger form of discrimination 
which at Yale has a lot to do with being 
a woman," Diane said. She sat cross-
legged, sipping tea in her stylish, sunny 
apartment. A drawing of a woman's 
torso hung on the refrigerator door. 


"The average freshman comes to 
Yale and he feels as if he's given a cer-
tain amount of authority. and he 
defines himself in relation to it. She, I 
should say. She feels powerless, not in 
control. It's not enough just to b~. when

everyone's so perfection-oriented. 
When women to start to control their 
bodies, it's equated with success. People 
complimented me when I got skinnier, 
they told me I looked great, I looked 
terrific and together. And I was falling 
apart inside. 


"When you arrive here, it's the first 
time you have adult or sexual respon-
sibilities, or lack of them, and you 
become conscious of sexual attraction, 
what 'sexy' is and all of a sudden, what 
you have to be. I had a boyfriend 
freshman year who told me every night 
what parts of my body he thought were 
too fat. I felt horribly guilty that I hadn't 
noticed it before. 


"I became more and more conscious 
of my body and my eating habits. I 
thought he was to blame because he 
couldn't see bevond that sort of thing in 
me, but he was expressing a widely and 
unconsciouslY held belief, that women 
aren't meant 'to be the way they natural-
ly are-curvy and round." 


In adjusting to Yale's competitive 
life, Diane began to judge herself 
against her ideal view of body, and her 
weight dropped to 90 pounds. "You feel 
your body can never be good enough, 
therefore you can never be good 
enough. The anorexic really does feel 
she's controlling her problems when 
she's out in the world, but she goes 
home and bottoms out. She can always 
be more thin or more successful." 


Unable to cope with her problem 
alone, Diane moved in with a friend the 
second semester of her sophomore year. 
"One night at around 3 a.m. my friend 
took me to DUH [Department of 
Undergraduate Health, 
the former 
name of University Health Services 
(UHS)) because I just couldn't deal. I 
talked to the person there in a way I 
hadn't talked to anyone in weeks. They 
put me upstairs, and I looked down 
tfrom the fifth floor and said I'm never 
going back to that horrible place that 
made me feel so bad." She took a year 
off 
and 
went 
into 
therapy. 


Howland believes the pressures of 
college often intensify problems with 
food. "I treat an enormous amount of 
women at Yale with eating disorders," 
she said, sitting in her Trumbull Street 
"The dining halls are 
disastrous for anyone 
who has problems with 
food." 
three-room "office," complete with 
balcony, fully-equipped kitchen and 
brass candlesticks over the hearth. The 
decor makes her patients feel more at 
home, less institutionalized. She treats 
close to 45 anorexics or bulimics. 


"I think eating disorders have reached 
epidemic proportions on most college 
campuses, and Yale is probably worse 
than most. You have sensitive, am-
bitious women here. Many women at 
Yale unconsciously identify with their 
fathers, and they haven't come to terms 
with how to nurture themselves. They 
haven't internalized their mothers. At 
Yale they come to internalize the man's 
world, and Yale is very male. Yale 
places large demands- there is a need 
to perform, a need to pretend, a need to 
sell yourself to the purpose of produc-
tion. Some people ftll the void sym-
bolically through food. There are so 
many women at Yale who deny that 
they have any emotional needs at all." 


One bulimic voiced a similar opinion: 
"You had to be compulsive to get in 
here, and once you get here you have to 
be compulsive again."

**Title: Dietary Diseases**
**Page number(s): 47**

Anorexia nervosa is a disease nf self-
starvation. Anorexics often lose up to 25 
percent of their bod>· weight through 
dieting or fanatic exercise. In extreme 
cases, muscle and digestive systems 
deteriorate to the point where the pa-
tient's body can no longer accept 
nutrients. Victims of bulimia will binge 
on excessive quantities of food, then 
purge 
their systems 
through 
self-
induced vomiting. Both diseases are 
r,>bsessive forms of addiction. In both. 
laxatives or diuretics are used to in-
crease weight Joss. The mortality rate 
for anorexics is two to three percent. 
It is 
twice as high 
for bulimics. 


''There are a lot of mtnor symptoms 
that indicate you might have an eating 
disorder," one anorexic woman explain-
ed. "Are there certain foods you will 
never eat? Do you eat the same foods 
every day, and do rou have anxiety 
before and guih after a meal? Do you 
dislike your body? When you exercise 
do you think of the amount of calories 
you are burning. instead of enjoyin'{ the 
activity? Do you ever fast or make 
yourself throw up? Is it important to 
you to have a real sense of control 
around food, and are vou conscious of 
that?" Another anore;ic said. ~People 
define eating disorders in much too 
strict terms- are you a skeleton? do you 
put your finger down your throat? But 
af you are so concerned about food. you 
ould deal with the problem before it 
ruins the quality of your life."

they've done and that it aflccts the ma-
jority of women on campus- usuall}' 
the prettiest, the brightest, most engag-
ing and exhubcrant, the most com-
petitive ones." 


The disease varies in intensitv. '"I 
treated one bulimic at Yale who had a 
$200-a-day addiction for six week:-;," 
Howland said. -she would binge only 
the best food, and she would throw up 
72 times a day. She did nothin~ but 
that. It's more typical to do it three to 
seven times a day, in addition to keep-
ing down betwet•n two and five meals." 


Serious complications can result from 
the disease. "There is a danger of heart 
attack and rupture of the stOmach or 
esophagous," 
Howland said. "The 
enamel of your teeth can also be damag-
ed. :-.;o system is unaffected in the case 
of anorexia or bulimia: the kidney, the

it.~ According to one bulimic. ''] don't 
think I'd have done anything about my 
problem or gone for help if I hadn't 
thought about the damage it does. Pt·o-
ple say that if you have bulimia rou

Students who are concerned about 
their own eating problems or those of a 
friend are encouraged to sc.·ek help. The 
Student Self-Care Exchange at Univer-

Letting the women rowers sit in the bus was not a good idea. They had 
just fmished rowing on the Derby and were drenched now by the river 
water and freezing rain of the late winter evening in 1975. Then they 
followed the same old routine: the men showered in the boathouse and 
dressed in warm clothes while the women stayed in their waterlogged 
sweats, waiting to return to Payne-Whitney because they had no shower 
facilities. 

The promised renovation of the boathouse was delayed for fmancial 
reasons, so the women sat on the bus as they had every fall and spring 
for the last three years. But this time they started talking. "What are we 
going to do?" someone fmally asked. 

"Let's go take a shower in Joni Barnett's Office." Barnett, now an 
associate secretary of the University, served as the director of women's 
athletics. 

"No, let's not get too destructive here." The women were not going to 
shower in Barnett's office, but they would make their point. They 
wanted everyone to know the oonditions under which they practiced and 
oompeted. The women felt ignored by the Athletic Department, viewing 
Barnett as a figurehead or buffer between them and the administration. 

Chris Ernst, '76, looked at her friend Ann Warner, '77, and said "I 
dare you to." It was that simple. The plan was sealed, set. 

Ernst made an appointment with Barnett, and a week later, she and 
18 teammates went to Barnett's office dressed in their sweats. There, 
they stripped before the administrator, each woman with the words "Ti-
tle IX," for the legislation which assured equality in education, written in 
blue magic marker across her chest and back. A Yale Daily News 
photographer who also worked for The New York Tunes stood on a chair 
behind the women, capturing the look on Barnett's face as the naked 
Ernst read her statement. Because the Tunes had a slow news week, the 
paper printed the photograph, reported the incident and generally left 
Yale embarassed. 

Following a national trend in the 1970s and the ratification of Title IX, 
women's athletics at Yale grew in both success and range. The rowers 
now have shower facilities in Derby, women here play lacrosse and ice 
hockey, make AD-American for cross-country and basketball. In between 
practices and early morning lifts, some women athletes speak frequently 
about their dissatisfaction with Yale's treatment of women's sports. Like 
the crew team in March 1975, these women criticize the Athletic Depart-
ment while working to chapge it. 

"Unless you get 
political, you won't be 
able to play your sport 
the way you want."

Yet the status of women's athletics can 
be interpreted and explained in a variety 
of ways. Athletes, alumni, coaches, ad-
minstrators: each group, and often each 
pers~m in the group, has a different view 
of Yale's dedication to women in sports. 
There are no clear, unbiased accounts of 
women's athletics here, rather a variety 
of voices, often urgent and adamant, 
from which to choose.

Association (YWAO) disintegrates, people leav-

ga/Mr. President Georgeanne NaJJress, PC '85, 
and Vice President of GmlXUICes Missy Parks, 
TC '85, sit on a couch, Vice President Lucy 
&mlwlz, CC '85, reclines in an armchair. 

Missy: Freshman year, I thought the women 
wlw cvmplained were paranoid. But there~ no 
going back now. I've gained a certain con-
cioUSMss o/ virtue of my experience with the ad-
ministraJWn and several really dynamic women. 

Georgeanne: I was so angry freshman year. I 
mnember fold hocky was inviud to a post-
season tournament. 
That~ when I realized the 
reallacJc of communicaiion between the Athletic 
54 The New Journal/ March I. 1985 
Department and the teams. Our coach was mak-
ing arrangements to go, but the administration 
didn't even know we were near qualifying and 
so told us we couldn't participate. Harvard, wlw 
was ranked below us with a worse record, went 
in OUT place. 

Unlike Nattress, most women athletes do 
not begin their Yale careers with disillu-
sionment. They arrive to fmd a large, 
well-equipped gym, Coxe Cage and a 
history of successful teams. Although 
preparing to try out for the national crew 
squad, 
Nattress's successor , 
Sarah 
Carlson, BK '86, carne to Yale initially as 
a basketball player. She was quickly im-
pressed with the pre-game meals, the 
payment of hotel expenses, the funding 
for her team. Her vice president, Pia 
Sass, SM '86, has also played several 
sports here, begirming as a field hockey 
player. "For field hockey, Yale always 
seemed one of the best places to play. It 
had a nice field, good coaching and a 
good team," Sass said. "I was defmitely 
impressed with program. In fact, for the 
first year and a half, I was impressed 
with all athletics at Yale. I heard no com-
plaints." 

Gradually, 
after talking to older 
athletes or looking at the men's teams, 
Carlson and Sass realized the inade-
quacies of the women's athletic program. 
Like so many women before them they 
ask the crucial question: is Yale's Athletic 
Department 
committed to 
women's 
sports? "Commitment" entails funding, 
use of facilities, promotion, varsity status 
of sports, coaching. But the word also en-
compasses opinion, communication and 
attitudes toward women athletes. 

' ' Missy: (leaning forward, toward Georgeanne) 
We all buy into the idea that men are the real 
athletes and that women are somelww facsimiles. 
You reOJly have In fight the subtleties of sexism. 

Georgeanne: (quietly) WiJhin and without 
you. 

Missy: 'lnis plaa is still racist and sexist. 

Georgeanne: WiJh big letlers. 

Missy: 17le schedule posters are a pnftct t.llll17l· 
ple of how the Athletic Department Si9'S "Yes, 
yes" and never gets anything done. 11ley used to 
have a sandwich board out in front of Ray

women :r basknball. • !left for a year and wlzm I 
returned, the posters hod gone back to before. lfs 
indicative of the AdministraJWn1 aJtilude toward 
women~ athletics. 

Without slam dunks and frequent fights 
on the ice, women's sports may never at-
tract the crowds men's games do. There-
fore, if these events are not as "exciting" 
as men's, no amount of advertisement 
will help promote them. Many here feel, 
however, that only awareness of the 
special qualities of women's athletics will 
trigger appreciation. This year, the Stu-
dent Committee on Athletics (SCA) peti-
tioned the Athletic Department to pr<>-
duce schedule posters for all teams. 
Moreover, all sports, whether wrestling 
or squash, will be gender specified. •1 
know it's repetitive to say Yale men's 
football, but it's frustrating to see men's 
basketball as 'Yale' basketball because 
women's basketball is just as much 'Yale 
basketball,"' Carlson said. 

Athletic Director Frank Ryan feels the 
posters will help ease the strong and con-
stant sense of inequity among many 
women athletes, but also noted a general

apathy about sport at Yale. To promote 
women's athletics further, Ryan and the 
SCA are discussing a women's sports 
week in the spring. "There are so many 
sports, so many other demands on our 
leisure time here," Ryan said. "It's the 
same thing at other Ivy League schools. 
With a little luck, we can get some atten-
tion, but we can't manufacture it." 

Lucy: When people start talking about women's 
athletics, everything sounds negaJive, maybe 
because it's all repressed. A lot of women can 
come here and be really happy, not realize they're 
missing anything. The most positive experiencu 
are mack by the athletes themselves. 

George anne: There are good facilitus, good 
coaching. It's an amazing experience. 

Missy: I ftel very positive about my athletic ex-
periLnces here but I have my own feelings, and 
tky're not based on facts, figures and numbers. 
For example the coaches stay in their own 
cubicles. They won~ taJJc with each other. Oh, 
and salaries are taboo. {Former lacrosse and fold 
hocky coach} Robin Cash started breaking the 
silerzas and look where she is now. Whenever 
tMy tkvelop camaradnU, iL's time to move on. 

Last year, much controversy and com-
plaint 
focused 
on the coaching of 
women's athletics. Prior to 1977, most 
coaches of women's sports worked part-
time. Today, only Ice Hockey Coach 
Kathy Lenahan serves on a part-time 
basis. Her captain, Anne Bingham, TC 
'86, enjoys having a woman coach now. 
Yet Lenahan's absence for part of the 
day concerns Bingham. "It's hard to ex-
plain the morale boost you have when 
your coach can dress in the locker room 
with you, when she understands your 
problems. But [former coach] Peter 
Downey was around the rink all the time. 
He was there when recruits dropped in, 
to get phone calls, to talk to the captain at 
lunch time," Bingham said. 

The issue of dual coaching assignments 
troubles many athletes, because they 
think their coaches simply don't have the 
time to provide the attention the team 
needs. 

Assistant coaches' multiple 
assignments often leave them little time 
to recruit. Some sports need assistant 
coaching but go without, such as gym-
nastics, which operates with a one-on-one 
coaching philosophy. 

· 

For every woman coach with several 
assignments, Ryan points to a man in the 
same position. 
He claimed coaches 
receive such assignments because, as full-
time employees, they should work all 
nine months of the academic year. 

After Robin Cash's departure from 
her two head coaching positions, her 
assistant Dale Philippi-Walker took over 
lacrosse. Philippi-Walker, however, also 
coaches squash, and while the lacrosse 
team practices indoors before spring 
break, she must continue with her 
squash responsibilities. She volunteered 
for the lacrosse position, giving the 
Athletic Department time to fmd a per-
manent replacement for Cash. 

Despite their double-duty, woman 
coaches at Yale are paid consistently 
lower than the men. In 1984 the highest 
paid woman coach earned less than 
$30,000, and at least 10 male coaches 
received more than that sum. Moreover, 
the highest paid men's coach took home 
$40,000 more than his female counter-
part. 

"The women are younger, less ex-
perienced. They're starting where the 
men started," Ryan said. "The 
marketplace sets their salaries. The Ivy 
League does painstaking research on 
salaries, and we exchange our salary 
records. Salaries at Yale should be and 
are very competitive in this marketplace. 
We're worried more about equity than 
anything else." 

Missy: A big issue is: to what extent is iL our 
responsihility to point out problems to the ad-
ministraJum? We're athletes, first and foremost, 
and iL's a bummer to realize you're not a priority 
around here. 

Georgeanne: The men's programs are am-
stantly updaJed, but the women must always re-
mind the administration, we have to be the 
squea1cy wheeL 

Missy: The men grl updal.ed but we n«d 
essentials. 

Georgeanne: There dotsn~ seem to be a am-
stant commilmmt to growth here. We lvwe to 
k#J asking them, 'What are your goo1s., 'If you 
confront them, tMy luwe to thmk about you. 

Lucy: They say they're making a commiJmmt 
to be the best in the fl!)ll.Lague. But the women's 
basketball team can~ grow wilhout Jneakrs and 
the ice hockey team can't grow without slraJa. 

"We all buy into the 
idea that men are the 
real athletes and that 
women are somehow 
facsimiles. You really 
have to fight the 
subtleties of sexism."

mdce it ~si!JI all the way.' With sojtba.ll, they 
sltlrled the team on a really inadequate level. 

The controversy over the women's 
volleyball team incorporates many of the 
criticisms about Yale and women's 
athletics. In 1979 the team won the Ivy 
League title and was then cut from varsi-
ty to club level. It lost coaching, use of 
trainers, funding for equipment and 
uniforms and use of the amphitheater for 
home games. Nonetheless, 40 women 
tried out last fall for the squad of 16, and 
the team fmished third in the Ivy 
League, against other teams which have 
the amenities of varsity standing. "Other 
than Dartmouth, which is 10 years 
behind in women's sports anyway, we're 
the only Ivy League team that is club. 
We can't get as far as we want like this," 
said Cathy Robohm, TC '86, co-captain 
of the volleyball team. "Other schools are 
jealous of the talent we have on our team, 
and other volleyball coaches really sup-
port us. But there's only so much 
pressure they can put on our administra-
tion." 

The Athletic Department, however, 
believes varsity volleyball would be too 
expensive, forcing the department to cut 
another sport. Ryan said initiating varsity 
volleyball would cost his department 
$40,000 to $50,000. He foresees an 
overlap of volleyball and basketball 
seasons, which would cause problems in 
the use of the amphitheater. Moreover, 
varsity volleyball would not be well-
received by an Admissions Office which 
feels Yale already has too many varsity 
sports. 

Robohm has heard these objections 
many times in the last three years, and 
she has answers to all of them. If Yale 
cannot afford another varsity sport, she 
does not understand why women's golf, a 
team which must advertise for players, 
was added to- the roster. Robohm has 
presented a petition to the Faculty Com-
mittee on Athletics and will meet with 
them in March. "When they say 'varsity 
all the way,' that includes a lot of ex-
travagance. We're not asking for steak 
dinners at Kline Bio every night, bur only 
for a few advantages of being a varsity 
sport. It's ridiculous for them to quote a 
figure like $50,000 when we're getting by, 
just barely, on $800. They think we want 
a full-time coach, but our old coach would 
come back on a part-time basis," she said. 
"We have only a few of our games at 
home, so it wouldn't be difficult to have 
the basketball 'captain's practices' upstairs 
then. We don't have to do any recruiting 
either, because right now as a club we 
have many more women than we need 
trying out." 

Missy: If there's nothing w hide, why is there a 
silence at the Athletic Department? They should 
publish the athletic budget, disclose coaches 
salaries, becau..se they're not equal, the budgets 
aren't equal. 

Everything comes down to funding. 
Money for pads which fit female ice 
hockey players, for trainers, for assistant 
coaches, for new varsity teams. The 
Athletic Department states it does not 
have the money to spend, while the 
women contend if they were a priority, 
the administration would fmd the capital. 

The athletic budget this year came to 
about $5.5 million, which the six associate 
athletic directors divided. Ryan admitted 
the portion given each team is not equal, 
explaining a budget depends on the costs 
of the individual squad: coaches, travel, 
contests, equipment and recruiting. 

The women, however, see a vicious 
circle in the administration's funding 
philosophy. The department wants to see 
a successful team before it increases its 
budget. The athletes believe the financial 
commitment is necessary before a pro-
gram becomes successful. 

Current athletes and alumni are trying 
to create a fmancial base for themselves, 
either through the formation of alumni 
associations or endowments. Last fall 
Yale endowed women's crew after alumni 
raised $54,000 since 1979. Women's crew 
is part of the larger, wealthy Yale Crew 
Association, which has paid for much of 
the women's expenses over the last few 
years. "If we wanted to go to Florida in 
the spring, we had to get money from 
our parents and friends. Men's crew 
shared their money with us, but we still 
had to ask them for it," recalled Anne 
Boucher, '81, chairperson for the endow-
ment. "Other alumni associations are 
reluctant to give money they've saved for 
the men to the women, but they don't 
realize they will get 100 new members 
that way." 

As Boucher works within the system to 
improve crew, Ernst urges women 
athletes to do all they can for their teams, 
in and out of the system. She believes 
Yale will move only if pushed and em-
harassed. "Athletics is a sensitive spot, 
the nerves are rawer there. Sports are 
not as socially acceptable as simply study-
ing, for women at Yale. There's the at-
titude, 'You girls aren't serious about 
sports. If you are, there's something 
wrong with you,"' Ernst said. "Coaches 
can't argue or they'll get ftred. But 
students can't get fired. Unless you get 
political, you won't be able to play your 
sport the way you want." 

Nancy Harthun, CC '87, walks in and sits 
across from Lucy, next w the couch. She listens 
intently as the older women talJc about Frank 
Ryan, the thpartmental bureaucracy, the search 
for a new associate directJJr of athletics w replaa 
Kit Morris. 

Naricy: The administrative sysfml is a mess. 
It's a shabby operation from wp w botWm. Few 
of the teams have managers. 
There's no 
organization -when I come w a game I don't 
know what I should be doing as a manager. 
The detaiLs 
don~ work, and that distracts 
athletes. 

Georgeanne: We're hoping w get a wom411 as 
the new associate directJJr. Maybe that wiU 
"revolutionize"' things. (She looks at Missy who 
has sat quietly for several minutes.) 

Missy: I'm just thinking about the future of 
women's athletics here. The women are more 
conservative, maybe complaant. I don~ want w 
lose things, but that's e.xrutly what I'm t:ifraid of 
I'm one of the last who saw the bad old days of 
women's sports here. I was here with people 
who did the TiLle IX strip. People now don~ 
reali.u the pain, anger and hard work those 
women went through so athletics wouldn't be se-
cond class. There's no forgetting our hisWry, but 
some have already forgotten . Some never knew.

**Title: The Compleat Cartoonist**
**Author: Rich Blow**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
When Sandra Boynton tells you she is happy with her life, believe her. 
She has a right to feel that way. The 31-year-old artist and humorist is 
the acknowledged genius in her field, lives on a beautiful 40-acre farm in 
Lakeville, Connecticut which she bought herself, and supports her hus-
band and three young children. Boynton draws greeting cards for a living 
and has been doing so ever since she graduated from Yale in 1974. 
Her artwork, replete with rare and bizarre animals like chocolate-
loving pigs, heartbroken ewes and sourpuss cats, 
is instantly 
recognizable. Those animals, combined with Boynton's appealing wry 
humor, have made the unpretentious artist an industry phenomenon. 
Over 100 million of her cards are sold every year, "mostly to friends and 
family," according to Boynton. Add to that astonishing figure all the 
calendars, mugs, T-shirts and so on that Boynton devotees purchase and 
it becomes clear Sandra Boynton is big business indeed. 
"If I had to apply to Yale again and I said on my application my goal in 
life was to draw greeting cards, they would never accept me," said Boyn-
ton, a slim woman with straight brown hair, freckles and an appealing 
smile. Luckily for Yale, when Boynton applied in 1969 she had no such 
ambition. Instead she wanted to be a director and eventually wound up 
majoring in English. "I took virtually no art courses while I was at Yale," 
Boynton remembered. "At the time, that department was just not very 
good, and besides it was geared towards graduate students. The English 
Department, on the other hand, was just fantastic." 


Boynton looks back on her time at Yale during the U niversitys initial 
years of coeducation as a very positive experience, with only a few reser-
vations. "There were undeniably some disadvantages in being a woman 
here in that changeover period," she recalled. "For me, the most difficult 
time was freshman year, and I think that was true for most of us. All the 
women were in Vanderbilt, which was an WlCOmfortable situation 
because it was so much like a fortress. As for the men ... well, with the 
male-to-female ratio as high as it was, you tended to meet only the men 
who were pretty sure they were the guys you'd want to know. Only after 
freshman year did we realize not all Yale men were like that." 


Indeed, Boynton would end up marrying one of those men she met 
after freshman year, an Olympic canoer named Jamie McEwan. They 
met while he was a junior in Saybrook and she was a senior in Calhoun. 
The two were able to maintain their relationship after Boynton 
graduated, but did not decide to marry until several years later when 
their lives had settled down.· 


It was in that first summer after 
graduation when Boynton, who had 
drawn since childhood, discovered her 
natural talent as an artist could be 
parlayed into profit. She was waitress-
ing to earn money for the Berkeley 
School of Drama, which she would at-
tend that fall, when she decided there 
had to be a better way to finance her 
education. 
"My sister 
Pam 
made 
jewelry and sold it in local stores," 
Boynton said, "so I thought I would 
make use of whatever talent I might 
have. Painting cards was the only way I 
could think of to make money. Plus. at 
the time it was really an open market; 
there certainly weren't many greeting 
cards that I would have bought. As it 
turned out, the market was a lot more 
open than I had thought." 


All told, Bovnton would receive 
orders for 120,000 of her cards, orders 
she had to fill in time for Christmas. 
She hand painted 60,000 cards that 
summer, 
working at 
assembly-line 
speed to crank out up to four of them a 
minute, and was able to get an uncle to 
print the next batch of 60,000. Having 
seen that people not only liked her cards 
but were willing to pay for them, Boyn-
ton's next step was to take 27 of her 
designs to an industry trade show. 
There she ran into problems. Industry 
representati+:s wanted her designs, but 
they also wanted more control over her 
work than Boynton was willing to relin-
quish. They wanted her to name her 
animals, to put bows on their heads and 
to get rid of the white backgrounds 
which she knew made her cards stand 
out on retailers' shelves. White cards get 
dirty, and store owners would never 
buy them, Boynton was informed. The 
final straw for the young artist came 
when she learned she would have to sell 
her designs at a flat rate rather than 
maintain ownership and receive 
royalties on their sales. For Boynton, 
there was little point to marketing her-
cards if they weren't going to look like 
she wanted them to, and she left the 
show without a company to merchan-
dise her art. 


"I was very lucky," Boynton said 
about that decision. "Frankly, I didn't 
need the money badly enough to give 
up control of my work. It was a for-
tunate luxury to say, 'I'll do this on my 
own terms or I won't do it at all."' 


A luxury, perhaps, but the desire to 
retain final control over her art would 
become a constant in Boynton's career 
thereafter. It is not that Boynton is ar-
rogant- she isn't- it is just very impor-
tant to her that commercial pressures 
never force her to lower the quality of 
her work. The timing was perfect, then, 
for Boynton to meet a representative of 
Recycled Paper Products, a 
small 
greeting card company with the flex-
ibility to allow Boynton the kind of con-
trol she wanted. Anonymous animals, 
white backgrounds -and royalties were 
not going to keep Recycled Paper from 
signing Boynton to a contract. In the 10 
years since, Boynton has drawn over 
2500 designs for Recycled Paper and 
company 
revenues have 
risen 
to 
somewhere in the neighborhood of S40 
million. Boynton cards account for 
almost half of that sum. "Other com-
panies have tried to woo me away," 
Boynton concedes today, "but there's no 
reason why I should go. This company 
has been ,·ery good to me." 


With her new contract. Boynton headed 
to California as planned, but she found 
Berkeley too "alien" and returned to 
New H aven. Back at Yale, she enrolled 
at the Drama School in the Doctor of 
Fine Arts program. "At the time," she 
said, "that program was sort of a black 
sheep, 
a 
concession 
to academia. 
Neither the teachers nor the students 
were of the same high quality I'd come 
to expect when I was an under-
graduate." Disappointed and frustrated , 
Boynton quit the program after a year 
and a half to marry McEwan and pur-
sue a full-time career with Recycled 
Paper. It was a decision she has never 
had cause to regret. 


Boynton 
seems 
handle 
her 
phenomenal success with the same kind 
of warm humor she displays in her 
cards. Laughing, she said, "In some 
people's minds I'm extraordinarily 
famous; other people have absolutely no 
idea who I am. That may be because 
I've never done TV specials and I don't 
have a line of licensed Sandra Boynton 
footwear. It's very easy for me to feel or-
dinary. I mean, it's certainly not like 
I'm Meryl Streep and people come 
rushing up to me in Burger King to tell 
me how much they loved my last 
movie." She paused and added, "I am 
relatively anonymous and I like it that 
wav. I don't think I'd ever want to 
ch~nge that." 


Boynton is particularly fortunate in 
that while commercial success has not 
brought her unwanted attention, it has 
given her the money to live a quiet, 
comfortable rural life with her husband 
and children. H er marriage seems 
almost suspiciously blissful; Boynton 
herself is more than willing to admit it 
is, at the verv least, 
"unorthodox.~

lished novel and trains for the world 
championships in canoeing, Boynton 
draws in her studio and is largely 
responsible for taking care of the kids 
during the day. It may sound like a lop-
sided arrangement, 
but Boynton 
does not consider it so. "I support my 
husband and he doesn't have any prob-
lems with that, nor do I. In fact, I think 
he thinks this arrangement is just great. 
There's no tension because of the 
money. I mean, I'm doing what I love 
to do, what I'd be doing even if I weren't 
married." 

As if her contractual obligations 
were not enough to keep her busy, Boyn-
ton manages to spend a significant 
amount of time with her children: 
Caitlin McEwan, age five, Kevin Boyn-
ton, who is three years old, and Devin 
M cEwan, four months. "We alternated 
last names with our children," Boynton 
explains, "because we both wanted our 
family 
names 
to 
continue and 
hyphenating the names would have 
been a real burden. Imagine having 
'Boynton-M cEwan' for a last name," she 
laughed. 

Boynton is renowned for her drive 
and productivity, and one well-known 
anecdote about the artist recounts how 
she returned to her drawing table just 
16 hours after her son Keith was born in 
order to meet a deadline. "In some peo-
ple's eyes that makes me appear really 
tough, almost bitchy, but that's really 
not the case," Boynton said. "I just feel 
very strongly that if a whole company is 
counting on you, you had better live up 
to your end of the bargain." Even with a 
new baby Boynton manages to keep 
drawing a steady rate. although she ad-
mitted, "There's no such thing as an 
average day with three kids. One day 
everything will be fine, the next some-
one will have to be rushed to the doctor, 
and the day after that it's my turn to 
pick up the kids at school. There are 
times when I feel like an average 
housewife, and that's okay." 

After ten years of drawing cards, 
Boynton is often asked whether she con-
siders her career suitable for a Yale 
alumna with several years of graduate 
school. In other words, does drawing 
her cards really make Boynton an artist 
worthy of respect? "I'm finally learning 
how to be philosophical about all this," 
Boynton sighed. "I 
think 
people 
sometimes have the attitude that draw-
ing greeting cards isn't a serious thing 
for me to do, that it's not respectable for 
a Yale graduate and all that. I can 
understand that because sometimes I 
have that attitude myself. There's a 
sense that my time would be better 
spt•nt winning Pulitzer Prizes or writing 
great American novels. Occasionally I 
do think of writing a play, but at this 
point I can't imagine when I would find 
the time." 

Boynton has written several books, 
most notably Tlu Compltat Turkey and 
CHOCOLATE: Thr Consuming Passion, 
but they look and sound much like her 
cards and have not yet won any 
Pulitzers. Boynton admitted that, in 
truth, this docs not upset her too much, 
describing CHOCOLATE as "a 
bestseller that consistently tr·ailed Thin 
Thighs in 30 Days on the charts, but a 
worthy book nonetheless. I know I real-
ly enjoy what I do," she said with no 
hint of apology. "It's just a lot of fun, and 
I've never felt like I've compromised 
myself more than I should have." 

Despite Boynton's frequent light-
heartedness, she takes her work very 
seriously. The artist is particularly 
angered by the recent proliferation of 
cards which look strangely like her own, 
with animals and sayings that could 
almost, but not quite, be found on a 
Boynton card. "It's a very deliberate im-
itation," she said, angry but resigned, 
"and there's very little you can do about 
it. I try not to get frustrated about that, 
but I do anyway." 

That concern for the quality of her 
work leads Boynton to eye carefully 
what other cartoonists and artists are 
c~at ing. She admits to being a great 
admirer of feUow Yalie Garry T rudeau, 
'71, while she exclaimed, "I can't stand 
GarjiL/d. I hate the art in GarjiL/d-what 
an unattractive character! More impor-
tantly, I think the whole strip is so 
negative and cynical. Some of my work 
has an edge to it, but I hope none of it is 
ever as mean as Garfold sometimes is." 

Not 
too long ago Boynton con-
sidered drawing a comic strip of her 
own; that experience, she recalled, was 
one of the most frustrating of her 
career. "I 
was 
talking to United 
Features about doing a strip and boy, 
was that depressing. Talk about lack of 
artistic control! They gave me the most 
confusing contract I've ever seen, and 
the gist of it was that if they didn't like 
my drawings or they didn't think I was 
funny enough, they could hire someone 
else to rewrite my stuff- and bill me to 
pay that person!" Not surprisingly, 
Boynton rejected United Features' of-
fer. 

Despite that setback, Boynton con-
tinues to break into those fields of art 
and merchandising she does not already 
dominate. At p•·esent she is working on 
three books simultaneously: a revision 
of Tht Complrat 
Turkty-"because I 
thought it wasn't complete"-and two 
books for younger readers tentatively 
titled Cloey and Maudt and Goodnight, 
Goodnight. A line of Boynton children's 
clothing is in the works, and she has 
long-term goals of creating animated 
ftlms for children. It is no wonder then 
the artist resents when people ask her 
how much longer she is going to keep 
doing the same thing. II is a question she 
often hears: "People ask me if I would 
be happy doing the same thing in ten 
years that I'm doing now. To me, that 
implies I'm doing the same stuff I was in 
1974, and I know that just isn't true. As 
an artist and a humorist, I've grown a 
lot in that time. I like to think I'll keep 
on growing in that way." 

From selling cards door-to-door to 
becoming the industry's houest proper-
ty, Boynton has accomplished an amaz-
ing amount in one decade. Most im-
pressive, she has managed to retain her 
warmth, her humor and her in-
dependence in the process- you can 
read it in her cards. And as long as 
Boynton can hold on to those qualites 
which have made her work so beloved. 
it is likely the future holds only more 
promise for her. Sandra Boynton has 
come a long way, and she is by no 
means ready to stop now.
