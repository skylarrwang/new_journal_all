When Associate Professor of English 
and Comparative Literature Margie 
Ferguson served as a resident advisor in 
Morse in the early years of coeducation, 
she heard many complaints from 
women students who felt part of a 
minority on display. "I think it was 
partly through hearing them articulate 
their problems that I came to under-
stand how one feels as a minority on the 
faculty here," said Ferguson, who 
earned a graduate degree at Yale. 
If, as according to some, the quality 
of life for tenured women professors is 
satisfactory, why have over 20 percent 
of the women given tenure by Yale left 
for positions elsewhere? Yet if women 
comprise half of the new term appoint-
ments in the humanities, 
is 
this 
evidence of sexual discrimination? 
Since the release of last year's Crothers 
Report on the status of tenured women 
at Yale, debates regarding the female 
faculty continue. 
The report stated that in the past six 
years the number of tenured women 
faculty has increased by one position. 
while a total of 17 tenured positions 
were filled. Of Yale's 32 academic 
departments, only 12 have tenured 
women. If current trends in 
the 
humanities continue, the number of 
tenured women would not match the 
doctoral pool until 2024. 
"At the moment prospects are nil [for 
more tenured women) in our depart-
ment, and there probably won't be any 
for another three to four years unless 
the University grants new tenured posi-
tions," said Sophia Simmonds. director 
of undergraduate studies in Molecular 
Biology and Biophysics. 
"Every place I've been tenured. I've 
been the only woman," said Ruth Mar-
cus, professor of philosophy. She re-
called graduate schools with a total of 
three to five women students. "You 
couldn't even compute the percentage of 
them," she said. "But it could be 50 per-
cent in another few years." The pool of 
women graduating with Ph.D's is used 
to gauge a reasonable figure for women 
in tenure track positions. Marcus men-
tioned that as of 1984. 43. 1 percent of 
doctoral candidates in 
comparative 
literature were female, while Yale had 
no tenured women in that department. 
For Yale's tenured women, increased 
TeSPQnsibilities and job security · are 
closely linked. According to Ferguson, 
the first woman professor promoted 
from the ranks of her department, "If 
you're a man you can afford to say, 'No, 
I don't have time to serve on this com-
mittee,' but if you're a woman and the 
dean calls and asks you to be on a c.:om-
mittee, often you want the woman's 
point of view heard." She described the 
time restrictions resulting from "being 
somewhat overcommitted to commit-
tees" and advising the many graduate 
students who want to work with her. 
"It's striking they're all women at the 
moment. There's some sexual channel-
ing there," she said. 
Linda Colley, a Cambridge graduate 
and one of the few female associate pro-
fessors in the History Department, 
noticed another form of channeling. 
"People are more likely to assume that 
because I'm female I tend to do 
women's history." 
"The really nasty thing about this 
system is that the years from the late 
teens until age 35 are taken by estab-
lishing oneself in the profession. Those 
are the childbearing years. One of the 
main accusations from men who don't 
think 
women 
should 
have more 
numbers is that women don't produce 
as much because they have more dis· 
tractions." 
According to the Crothers Report. in 
the next six years 60 tenure spots should 
open in the Faculty of Arts and 
Sciences. The Report's major recom-
mendation was to increase the number 
of tenured women to 30 by that time, 
doubling the present number. Recently 
the number of non-tenured women on 
the faculty increased, while the total size 
of the faculty decreased. Professor of 
English Marie Borroff, who received 
tenure in the early 1960s, spoke op· 
timistically about the results of the 
report. which 
she helped present. 
.. \\'e're all aware of the problem in the 
department, and given the quality of 
the nontenured women coming up. 
more and more women ought to get 
tenure.'" 
Simmonds, however, offered a word 
of caution to women planning to teach 
in her field: "The main thing I think 
women have to realize is, equal oppor· 
tunity laws or no, they've got to be a lit· 
tle bit better than their male <·om~ti­
tion."
