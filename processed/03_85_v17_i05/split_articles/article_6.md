Yale was stunned when the engage-
ment turned out to have been only a 
courtship, but the experience raised stu-
dent expectations for coeducation. "The 
Vassar episode was very useful, very 
helpful to Yale," Brewster said. "The 
purgatorical period when we were 
negotiating with Vassar got the trustees 
and alumni used to the idea of 
undergraduate 
women 
at Yale. 
I 
favored the plan at the time, though in 
retrospect I'm glad they declined." He 
began to look into other options almost 
immediately, becoming convinced co-
education was an important part of 
Yale's future. 

Alumni support strengthened Brew-
ster's resolve. "I consulted with two very 
generous donors," Brewster said. "They 
said to act first and make financial ad-
justments later because they felt the 
commitment should be unambiguous." 
According to Chauncey, "John H ay 
Whitney, probably the University's 
largest single donqr, was very en-
couraging, and if the largest donor 
jumps on the bandwagon it is easier to 
handle complaints from those alumni 
who send $5 to $1 0 a year and threaten 
to cut off their support." 

In September 1968 Princeton re-
leased a study indicating 80 percent of 
the nation's top high school students 
thought coeducation made a college 
~ore attractive and only four percent 
thought it made it less attractive. 
Princeton appeared headed rapidly 
toward coeducation, a blow to the pride 
of Yale students, who feared the 
~niversity would at best end up follow-
Ing Princeton's lead and at worst 
become the only all-male Ivy school if 
Princeton and Dartmouth admitted 
women. "Healthy competition between 
Yale and Princeton was an immediate, 
driving force," said Elga Wasserman, 
fir:st chairman of the University Com-
mntee on Coeducation. 

"We thought we'd be left out of the 
parade," Brewster said. "To be a single-
sex institution at a time when all kinds 
of schools were going coed meant a 
more and more difficult time attracting 
s!udents." The students may have con-
Sidered it a question of honor, but the 
Elga Wasserman ran the Coeducation Office for two years and is now a 
lawyer in New Haven 
administration saw a potential crisis of 
quality. 

The Corporation unanimously decid-
ed undergraduate education for women 
would improve the quality of Yale Col-
lege and in October directed the ad-
ministration to develop a plan of 
coeducation or coordination. Student 
debate shifted focus from whether to 
coeducate to how and when. Students 
for a Democratic Society demanded 
immediate full coeducation. The Class 
of 1969 claimed they would withhold 
their class gift until the administration 
formalized a plan. 

In early October the campus-wide 
Committee on Student Life put up 
posters urging students to push for 
coeducation: "The answer has to be 
coeducation. There is no middle road. 
Yale needs girls and girls need Yale. To 
dramatize this issue, we suggest that 
students arrange for geodesic domes to 
be placed on the Cross Campus as tem-
porary living quarters. Then, invite a 
few hundred girls from surrounding 
colleges to Yale for a week." The idea 
caught on. "To make a valid decision 
about what women want in a coeduca-
tional school, it seems logical to talk to 
women about it," Aviam Soifer, '69, 
wrote, proposing to invite 500 women 
to Yale between November 4 and 11. 

Over 2,000 women from nearby col-
leges expressed interest in participating. 
The organizers scrapped the geodesic 
domes when the adminstration agreed 
to let the women stay in dorms, 
recruited students to host women, 
raised money to pay for meals and 
selected 700 women to stay for two half-
week shifts. 

Coeducation thus arrived earlier than 
expected, though not to stay. There 
were speeches, 
teach-ins and film 
festivals; women attended classes, ate in 
dining halls and stayed in men's dorm 
rooms. A rally of 750 Yale and women 
students marched to Brewster's house 
demanding coeducation. Over 1, 700 
students petitioned f~r equal num~rs 
of men and women m the next class, 
women transfer students for the up-
perclasses and an increase in women 
faculty members. The YDN carried an 
ad for "Quality Aphrodisiacs for Coed 
Week." 

Reactions were mixed, though large-
ly favorable. "Coming from an all-girls' 
school, I didn't mind being appreciated 
all week long," one woman wrote. "This 
is one girl from Wellesley who would

nus whose daughter has been rejected. 
They were more protective of their 
daughters than of their sons; they 
equated rejecting their daughters with 
accusing them of being women of ill 
repute." 

T hose daughters were considered for 
admission by Chauncey, whom 
Brewster had appointed director of ad-
ministrative planning for coeducation, 
and Wasserman, who had been an 
assistant dean of the Graduate School 
and prospective master of the female 
T rumbull CoUege. Together the two 
were in charge of making coeducation 
happen in September 1969, beginning 
with the admissions process. 

"Sam and I read all the women's ap-
plications," Wassserman said. "We had 
slightly different criteria for the women. 
We knew this would be a pioneer class 
facing pioneer-type problems." 

Chauncey elaborated: "We believed it 
would be hardest on the upperclass 
women who would be in small groups 
in the colleges among men who had 
spent time at an all-male Yale. We tried 
to detect stability, strength, toughness." 

Over 4 ,000 women applied for the 588 
openings, while men had a much higher 
acceptance rate of four-to-one. This 
selectivity would eventually surface in 
the consistently higher grades women 
received during the first few years. 

The weekend before acceptance let-
ters went out Tht Ntw York Timts 
Magaziru reported, .. Many late-night 
buU sessions at Yale today reflect a cer-
tain nervousness over the confrontation 
with next fail's superwomen." The arti-
cle increased this tension when it 
characterized the admitted women as 
"female versions of Nietzsche's Uber-
mensch• and described some of them:

achievement tests. She had great recom-
mendations." 

Many applicants read the article and 
despaired. "What difference could it 
have made to Tht Ntw York Timts 
whether they published that article a 
week before or a week after our notifica-
tion? How insensitive could they be? I 
spent a hellish week just waiting for 
news. I was so nervous. I'd given up 
hope," commented one ·woman who was 
later accepted. 

Those whom Yale accepted and who 
accepted Yale faced great difficulties in 
the fail, mostly stemming from the 
eight-to-one ratio of men to women ... In 
retrospect, I view the housing situation 
as the major problem," Wasserman 
said. "The small number of women 
caused practical problems in rooming. 
Women roomed in fours, and out of 20 
to 25 students in each college it was 
hard to get congenial rooming ar-
rangements. The situation emphasized 
the women's minority status as if they 
were in a fishbowl." Media coverage 
treating coeducation as a "freakish ex-
periment," Wasserman added, inten-
sified the sense of being under observa-
tion. 

The ratio also caused problems in the 
classroom. "Manv classes had very few 
women," Wasserman said. "If a woman 
was absent, everyone noticed. Some 
professors asked their female students 
for the 
'women's point of view.' 
Overall, it just made for a more self-
conscious presence than would have 
been ideal." One professor com-
plimented a Directed Studies student 
for having worked so hard and finally 
reached the academic level cf the men 
in the class.
