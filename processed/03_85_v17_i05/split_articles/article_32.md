lished novel and trains for the world 
championships in canoeing, Boynton 
draws in her studio and is largely 
responsible for taking care of the kids 
during the day. It may sound like a lop-
sided arrangement, 
but Boynton 
does not consider it so. "I support my 
husband and he doesn't have any prob-
lems with that, nor do I. In fact, I think 
he thinks this arrangement is just great. 
There's no tension because of the 
money. I mean, I'm doing what I love 
to do, what I'd be doing even if I weren't 
married." 

As if her contractual obligations 
were not enough to keep her busy, Boyn-
ton manages to spend a significant 
amount of time with her children: 
Caitlin McEwan, age five, Kevin Boyn-
ton, who is three years old, and Devin 
M cEwan, four months. "We alternated 
last names with our children," Boynton 
explains, "because we both wanted our 
family 
names 
to 
continue and 
hyphenating the names would have 
been a real burden. Imagine having 
'Boynton-M cEwan' for a last name," she 
laughed. 

Boynton is renowned for her drive 
and productivity, and one well-known 
anecdote about the artist recounts how 
she returned to her drawing table just 
16 hours after her son Keith was born in 
order to meet a deadline. "In some peo-
ple's eyes that makes me appear really 
tough, almost bitchy, but that's really 
not the case," Boynton said. "I just feel 
very strongly that if a whole company is 
counting on you, you had better live up 
to your end of the bargain." Even with a 
new baby Boynton manages to keep 
drawing a steady rate. although she ad-
mitted, "There's no such thing as an 
average day with three kids. One day 
everything will be fine, the next some-
one will have to be rushed to the doctor, 
and the day after that it's my turn to 
pick up the kids at school. There are 
times when I feel like an average 
housewife, and that's okay." 

After ten years of drawing cards, 
Boynton is often asked whether she con-
siders her career suitable for a Yale 
alumna with several years of graduate 
school. In other words, does drawing 
her cards really make Boynton an artist 
worthy of respect? "I'm finally learning 
how to be philosophical about all this," 
Boynton sighed. "I 
think 
people 
sometimes have the attitude that draw-
ing greeting cards isn't a serious thing 
for me to do, that it's not respectable for 
a Yale graduate and all that. I can 
understand that because sometimes I 
have that attitude myself. There's a 
sense that my time would be better 
spt•nt winning Pulitzer Prizes or writing 
great American novels. Occasionally I 
do think of writing a play, but at this 
point I can't imagine when I would find 
the time." 

Boynton has written several books, 
most notably Tlu Compltat Turkey and 
CHOCOLATE: Thr Consuming Passion, 
but they look and sound much like her 
cards and have not yet won any 
Pulitzers. Boynton admitted that, in 
truth, this docs not upset her too much, 
describing CHOCOLATE as "a 
bestseller that consistently tr·ailed Thin 
Thighs in 30 Days on the charts, but a 
worthy book nonetheless. I know I real-
ly enjoy what I do," she said with no 
hint of apology. "It's just a lot of fun, and 
I've never felt like I've compromised 
myself more than I should have." 

Despite Boynton's frequent light-
heartedness, she takes her work very 
seriously. The artist is particularly 
angered by the recent proliferation of 
cards which look strangely like her own, 
with animals and sayings that could 
almost, but not quite, be found on a 
Boynton card. "It's a very deliberate im-
itation," she said, angry but resigned, 
"and there's very little you can do about 
it. I try not to get frustrated about that, 
but I do anyway." 

That concern for the quality of her 
work leads Boynton to eye carefully 
what other cartoonists and artists are 
c~at ing. She admits to being a great 
admirer of feUow Yalie Garry T rudeau, 
'71, while she exclaimed, "I can't stand 
GarjiL/d. I hate the art in GarjiL/d-what 
an unattractive character! More impor-
tantly, I think the whole strip is so 
negative and cynical. Some of my work 
has an edge to it, but I hope none of it is 
ever as mean as Garfold sometimes is." 

Not 
too long ago Boynton con-
sidered drawing a comic strip of her 
own; that experience, she recalled, was 
one of the most frustrating of her 
career. "I 
was 
talking to United 
Features about doing a strip and boy, 
was that depressing. Talk about lack of 
artistic control! They gave me the most 
confusing contract I've ever seen, and 
the gist of it was that if they didn't like 
my drawings or they didn't think I was 
funny enough, they could hire someone 
else to rewrite my stuff- and bill me to 
pay that person!" Not surprisingly, 
Boynton rejected United Features' of-
fer. 

Despite that setback, Boynton con-
tinues to break into those fields of art 
and merchandising she does not already 
dominate. At p•·esent she is working on 
three books simultaneously: a revision 
of Tht Complrat 
Turkty-"because I 
thought it wasn't complete"-and two 
books for younger readers tentatively 
titled Cloey and Maudt and Goodnight, 
Goodnight. A line of Boynton children's 
clothing is in the works, and she has 
long-term goals of creating animated 
ftlms for children. It is no wonder then 
the artist resents when people ask her 
how much longer she is going to keep 
doing the same thing. II is a question she 
often hears: "People ask me if I would 
be happy doing the same thing in ten 
years that I'm doing now. To me, that 
implies I'm doing the same stuff I was in 
1974, and I know that just isn't true. As 
an artist and a humorist, I've grown a 
lot in that time. I like to think I'll keep 
on growing in that way." 

From selling cards door-to-door to 
becoming the industry's houest proper-
ty, Boynton has accomplished an amaz-
ing amount in one decade. Most im-
pressive, she has managed to retain her 
warmth, her humor and her in-
dependence in the process- you can 
read it in her cards. And as long as 
Boynton can hold on to those qualites 
which have made her work so beloved. 
it is likely the future holds only more 
promise for her. Sandra Boynton has 
come a long way, and she is by no 
means ready to stop now.
