Riley didn't encounter any of the sex-
ism or separatism she said many 
women from the Class of 1973 felt. 
While others were most offended by 
paternalistic attitudes among Yale's 
faculty and administration, Riley said · 
she felt more empathetic and accepting. 
"I never felt diminished or threatened 
by the men. I just couldn't get angry at 
professors for their old-style man-
nerisms, for they weren't intentional; it 
wasn't representative of their complete 
philo~ophy." She paused. "Having 
women around was probably .a· relief 
after dealing with boys and frater-
nities- Yale became more civilized." 
An American studies major, Riley 
continued at Yale as a graduate stu-
dent. Though it has been eight years 
since she started her dissertation, and 
though she has not yet chosen to seek 
employment outside the home, Riley 
does not view her life as static. "I 
treasure the time I've been at home with 
my kids," she said softly, "but if I ever 
defmed my life by theirs, I'd feel upset 
and sick. I know at one point it will be 
the right time to finish, to write the 
dissertation and to teach on a college 
level." 
Riley sees a dramatic difference be-
tween the students she knew in the 
1960s and today's students at Yale. An 
advocate of New Deal social policies, 
Riley disagrees with much of President 
R eagan's philosophy. "At Yale I became 
politicized and intellectually excited for 
the first time. I thought being political 
was a lasting legacy from Vietnam, but 
I was wrong. I assumed everyone from 
age 20 would be aware and active. It's 
scary, but maybe by the time I'm 
teaching, I'll have to begin by defining 
liberalism for my students," she said, 
handing dried apricots to her eight-
year-old daughter, Gerun. "Students 
now are more distracted. In a sense 
they are truly out in the world because 
they have already imagined themselves 
there." Riley placed her teacup in the 
bright red kitchen sink. Wearing purple 
pants and a blue sweater, she seemed to 
blend in with the colorful room. "I may 
be 36 years old, but I'd give anything to 
go through Yale again. At the time I 
never thought it was wonderful, be-

cause I didn't imagine it ending." Bar-
bara Riley watched as her daughter 
rolled a handful of dice on the kitchen 
table. "Those years are a magical time," 
Riley said. She looked at her daughter, 
and they both laughed. 


Nina H orowitz, '75, took a far dif-
ferent path from Riley's. A doctor and a 
surgeon, H orowitz practices in an office 
on Church Street. On the wall next to 
her diploma from Columbia University 
Medical School hangs a certificate pro-
claiming Horowitz "a member of 
Calhoun College on the roll of the com-
pany of scholars." A black chair en-
graved with the Yale crest faces her 
desk. Now in her early 30s, Horowitz 
has jet-black hair and smoky-grey eyes. 
She glanced at the chair and explained, 
"It's brand new. 
All the surgical 
residents at Yale-New H aven H ospital 
get them." She hesitated. "I know it 
looks pretentious, but it's comfortable. I 
wouldn't want it in my own home, but 
for the office it's O.K." 
H orowitz calls herself one of the first 
female Yale boosters, but ironically, 
when she applied to Yale 14 years ago 
from an experimental high school in 
Maryland, it was in response to a dare. 
Once she was admitted Horowitz had 
no qualms coming to an institution 
where women were a minority, for she 
felt prepared after growing up with 
three brothers. Still, there were a few 
surprises. "My freshman year, women 
from Smith, Mt. Holyoke and Vassar 
were being bused into New Haven 
every Friday afternoon," Horowitz 
remembered. "It was totally bizarre. As 
the women entered the dining hall, the 
guys would hold up napkins rating 
them from zero to 10. The guys also 
claimed they could tell a Yale woman 
from the others solely by her sloppier at· 
tire." New H aven's Albert us Magnus 
College was a major, pervasive presence 
at Yale during this time. "At a mixer, if 
a Yale guy knew you went to Yale he'd 
turn around and walk away, looking for 
1 , a girl from another school," H orowitz 
explained. "My female friends and I 
had to bring a group of our male friends 
with us to mixers as security blankets-
someone to dance with. I felt as though 
my role should be as 'one of the guys,' 
everybody's best buddy. The women 
bused in were the exciting, hot lovers, 
while I was just 'comfortable.' Now it's 
beyond belief." · 
Horowitz perceived herself to be 
more the victim of subtle discrimination 
than blatant sexism. Several times she 
found herself the only woman in a 
seminar. "The professor would turn to 
me and say, 'Nina, as a woman, what is 
your view on this?' That really offended 
me," she admitted. "But the most 
discriminatory, biased group was the 
alums. They'd sit in the Calhoun dining 
hall and tell the women they had stop· 
ped giving money to Yale because we 
were admitted." 
Following the pre-med 
route, 
Horowitz frequently felt singled out. , 
While women at Yale were not entirely 
absent from the sciences, there were 
significantly 
fewer 
than 
in 
the 
humanities. "I never chose a science 
course where I'd be totally visible. It's 
hard to believe, but I never had a 
female lab partner at Yale," she said, 
leaning back in her thick leather chair. 
Horowitz also recognized signs of 
favoritism and reverse discrimination in 
her classes. "In one of Wolfgang 
Leonhard's courses, I could predict who 
my T A would · call on and who would 
get A's just by the number of 'thin 
lovelies' in the section. He was absolute· 
ly enthralled by a few of them," she 
remembered. A lack of female role 
models at Yale became another area of 
contention for Horowitz. "I can count 
on one hand the number of women I 


was taught by at Yale. It angers me that 
even those women never got tenure." 
By her senior year Horowitz came to 
accept and appreciate her Yale ex-
perience with only a few reservations. A 
freshman cot•nselor, a master's aide 
and a member of both the Slavic 
Chorus and the senior society Elihu, 
Horowitz felt women were increasingly 
integrated and "no longer an oddity." 
She explained, "It gives me a sense of 
pride that Yale made a commitment to 
offer opportunities women should never 
be deprived of having," H orowitz con-
firmed. In stark contrast to Riley, she 
believes, "Being one of the first women 
grads can make you feel obligated to be 
an outspoken leader and achiever. 
Many Yale women felt as if they were 
wasting their time if they didn't get 
super, macho jobs." 
H orowitz and her husband, a Yale 
graduate student in psychology, now 
live on the corner of Orange and Hum-
phrey Streets. A decade after grad-
uating, she admit~ to feeling like just 
another "old blue on the eve of her 1Oth 
reunion." Yet, only with time did 
H orowitz develop that sense of famili-
arity and comfort in being a Yalie. "To-
day Yale is probably a more normal 
place to be," she said reflectively. "It 
must be nice to go to a college where be-
ing a woman doesn't have to be an 
issue." 


Emily Fine, '73, a close friend of 
Horowitz, sat in her office in the Com-
munity Health Care Center (CHCC), 
down the road from the Long Wharf 
Theater. Fine may be only a few miles 
away from Yale and her friend, whom 
she met when Horowitz was a resident, 
but the symbolic distance between them 
is greater. Like Horowitz, Fine became 
a doctor and lives in the New Haven 
area, but she herself admitted, "Nina is 
much more :Joe College' than I'll ever 
be." 
The Obstetrics/Gynecology Depart-
ment lies hidden in a labyrinth of 
hallways and nurses' stations on the se-
cond floor of the CHCC building. The 
waiting room there is filled with preg-
nant women, young children, infants 
and a smattering of men. The recep-
tionist reads Your Daily Horoscope For '85. 
. Dr. Fine, one of seven women and two 
men in the division, receives a chorus of 
greetings when she steps into the 
waiting room. Wearing a black skirt 
which falls above the knee, high black 
boots and a furry sweater, Fine looks
