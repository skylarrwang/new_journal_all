The First Rabbis 
To the Editor: 
Although Tamar Lehrich's recent arti-
cle 
on Orthodox Jewish students 
("Within Two Worlds," TNJ, February 
1, 1985) was quite illuminating, some 
aspects of the author's historical portrait 
require correction. 

RabbiJames Ponet is not the frrst Yale 
graduate to become a rabbi. Rabbt 
Solomon Kohn was ordained even before 
he t'nroUed at Yale. He received his 
bachelor's degree in 1876. Rabbi Wolff 
Willner was graduated from Yale in 
1881. He was ordained in 1887-the 
same year that Yale granted him a 
master's degree. 

Ac; for the assertion that "three fun-
damental changes have occurred durin~ 
the last decade enabling the Orthodox 
Je~ to attend Yale," the author is wrong. 
Thts statement unfairly ignores the ac-
complishments of people such as Hillel 
RaJ:>bi 
Richard 
Israel 
( 1959-1971 ), 
Umversity Chaplain \\'illiam Sloane Cof-
fin (1958-1975) and Yale President A. 
Whitney Griswold (1950-1963). 

Sincerely, 
Dan A. Oren. '79
