mediately implicated, 
which isn't 
necessarily true. Men don't have to be 
trapped in roles they don't want any 
more than women do." 

Karin Cope, BK '85-, remembered 
being afraid to go into the Women's 
Center her freshman year. "I had this 
abstract fear that if I walked in, something 
was going to happen. I don't know what," 
she said. "Maybe they would just ask me 
some hard questions." Cope is the 
1984-85 
co-coordinator of Women's 
Center activities, which this semester in-
clude investigations into the problem of 
sexual harassment and the lack of 
tenured women faculty. The Women's 
Center also schedules time for meetings 
of the Women's Political Caucus, Yales-
bians, the Feminist Film Society and 
Aurora. It publishes From the Center, a bi-
weekly newsletter, and Cope plans to 
organize coalitions among the various 
women's groups on campus and other 
organizations. 

Last semester's strike 
closed the Center, but Cope hopes it can 
begin "maintaining a feminist voice on 
campus," 
by bringing in speakers, 
holding forums and writing editorials in 
campus publications. Cope adds that the 
Center contains a library of books 
relating to women's issues and provides a 
place where anyone can find people who 
have thought a lot about feminism and 
about the kinds of effects it can have on 
their lives. Cope believes the Center 
also fills a more symbolic function: "Most 
of us need to go back only one generation 
to realize the huge difference between 
what our mothers did or thought they 
could do and what we expect in our lives. 
So there's a need right now for institu-
tions that both preserve the memory of 
the past and do something towards fulfill-
ing those new expectations." 

The Yale Women's Center has not 
always been a familiar fixture on the Yale 
campus. It dates back to the early 1960s 
when it was called the New Haven 
Women's Liberation Center and had of-
fices in a small Yale-owned building on 
Park Street. The University terminated 
its lease in 1972, Cope alleged, because 
the women who ran it engaged in too 
much activism and protest. In 1976 six 
undergraduate women petitioned the
