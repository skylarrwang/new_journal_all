To get to Barbara Riley's house, fmd $1.15 in change and take the 
"S-Clinton" bus from the city down Route One, past the Montana Horse 
Ranch and Cozzi's Turkey Farm. While the jour ney to Guilford takes 
only 25 minutes, this small, densely-wooded town looks nothing like New 
Haven. Wander through the Country Dairy Store, past the American 
flags and white colonial homes, and'when you see the sign advising "15 
miles per hour" on a lane no more than 10 feet wide, you've probably 
reached Dunkrock Road. Barbara Riley lives here in a bright red, all-
wood, solar home her husband designed and built. The property 
borders on 2000 acres of state hiking trails. Nearby there is a pond for 
ice-skating and fishing and a grove of raspberry bushes where Riley's 
three children spend afternoons. 

Riley, '73, is one of the 230 women admitted to Yale's first fully coed 
class. Though a few of these first women have achieved fame and fman-
cial reward, most still search for their own defmitions of success and 
satisfaction. Riley belongs to a small group of women who, more than a 
decade after graduation, live and work only minutes away from the 
rooms they occupied at Yale. The women and their perceptions of their 
college experiences defy generalization, and each has her own story to tell 
about her time at Yale. 

Riley was one of a handful of transfer students admitted in 1969. H av-
ing grown up in a suburb of Minneapolis, she attended Minnesota's 
Lawrence University for two years. "I got married at age 20, which I still 
can't believe," Riley said, helping her four-year-old son Nathaniel pull on 
his boots and ushering him outside. When Riley's husb~d was admitted 
to the Yale School of Architecture, the couple moved to New Haven, and 
she worked for three years as administrative assistant to the dean in 
Timothy Dwight. Once she and her husband felt fmancially secure, Riley 
applied and was accepted to Yale. 

Drinking tea in her kitchen, Riley explained how her experiences as a 
married 23-year-old junior entering Yale were very different from those 
of her classmates. "I was able to come into Yale, take what I wanted and 
leave. It never was a social world for me, though at times I did feel self-
conscious about being older than most students." Because of her work ex-
perience at Yale, Riley easily established a diverse circle of friends com-
posed of undergraduates, architecture students, fellows and faculty. "My 
three years of working gave me time off to crave being in college and real-
ly to appreciate Yale. I was a little more aloof than most other women, 
but no one reacted in a hostile or negative way towards me just because I 
happened to be married."
