When Yale Needed "Girls" 
Tony Reese 
Men walked through Payne Whitney Gym nude. They ate dinner in 
roa.ts and ties. They drove to the Seven Sisters schools on weekends, and 
a few died in car crashes each year. They stared across dining halls at 
busloads of women who had come for a Yale mixer. For the Harvard 
game, their girlfriends came to New Haven and stayed in the Taft Hotel. 
Women were dates, seen on the weekends; men were friends and com-
rades who lived, ate, played and studied together. 

Yale in 1960 closely resembled the 18th-century college that preced-
ed it. By the decade's end Yale had undergone some radical changes and 
set others in motion. "The University was dragged, kicking and scream-
ing, into the 20th century," said Henry'Sam' Chauncey, Jr., '57, former 
University secretary. The decision to admit women marked the era's 
most fundamental transformation. 

It took the Admissions Office only a week to begin considering women 
applicants in 1968, but the decision to roeducate took over 10 years to 
evolve. The earliest serious mention of the idea came from then-Dean of 
Admissions Arthur Howe, Jr. at a September 1956 closed faculty 
meeting. "I became increasingly aware that a sizable number of people I 
was interested in for Yale did not apply or considered Yale their second 
choice because it was single-sex," said Howe. "And elements of social life 
here were incredibly distorted without women. So I spent the last 10 
minutes of my annual report on the glory of the entering class suggesting 
Yale consider admitting women. There was a thunderous response, very 
!POSitive enthusiasm. 

•nean William DeVane, however, was of a more temperate mind and 
recommended forming a committee to study the idea. That was it. An 
hour later I walked through my front door and the babysitter said, 'Gee 
Mr. Howe, I think it's great.' I didn't know what she was talking about. 
'That Yale's going coed,' she said. Some moonlighting scoundrel had ap-
parently given the story to a local radio station. The next morning 77ze 
New York Tunes printed it." 

President Griswold immediately declared Yale was "far from being 
..u:Jnvu· _,... that it would be the right course of action. There is not the 
pmotest possibility of its taking place at Yale within the foreseeable 
future.• The Yale Daily News (YDN) responded enthusiastically to 
~s 
denial. "'h save us!" the days editorial read. "Oh save us 
from giggling crowds, the domestic lecture and the home economics 
dasses of female inflltration. We will not spend our 25th reunion drinking 
with overweight matrons and their husbands who went to Hofstra. And 
the library stacks will not be indoor lovers lanes, and Mory's on Friday 
afternoons will not be the seen~ of chattering bridge parties." 

"I just started seeing a 
Yale co-ed and I see 
her constantly. I've 
gotten no work done 
whatsoever and this 
has got to stop."
