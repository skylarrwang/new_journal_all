I've had enough
I'm sick of seeing and touching
with silks of things
Sick of being the damn bridge for everybody
Nobody
Can talk to anybody
Without me Right?
I explain my mother to my father my father to my little sister
My little sister to my brother my brother to the white feminists
The white feminists to the Black church folks the Black church folks
To the ex-hippies the ex-hippies to the Black separatists the
Black separatists to the artists the artists to my friends' parents ...
Then
I've got to explain myself
To everybody
-"The Bridge Poem" by Donna Kate Rushin from This Bridge Called My Back, a collection
of writing by women of color

At first glance, you don't think the woman walking to a remote corner of 
Machine City can see herself in these words, nor do you assume she co-
ordinated a conference last year that brought many writers from This 
Bridge to speak at Yale. She dresses inconspicuously in a blue sweatshirt 
and jeans. People do not look up as she moves with an easy yet deter-
mined stride towards a clean table and slips quietly into a seat. Ahna 
Ayala, CC '86, clears her throat and begins speaking in a voice unique for 
its rhythmic balance of words and silence. 

"It's a definite cultural shock when you come to a place like Yale, so you 
want to hold on to something within you," she said. "But sometimes peo-
ple think if you want to hold on to your cultural background you just want 
to stand out and you don't want to learn the 'American way.' Of course I 
believe we should learn English and the skills needed to survive in this 
culture, but at the same time that doesn't mean we should give up 
everything that means anything to us- forget our Spanish, our music, 
everything else. I've heard people say, 'No speaking Spanish,' and to 
them it's a joke, but it's not." 

Although Ayala's parents came from Puerto Rico, she was born and 
raised in the United States. Having lived in several cities, Ayala attended 
schools with varied ethnic populations. Despite the diverse student body 
here, she feels alienated from most of the Yale community. 

"When I came here there was a lot I had to get used to. A lot of what I 
was taught was very different from what I first experienced here. I sat 
down with some of my friends who were white, and I'd try to explain to 
them I felt alienated and I hadn't heard of many of the customs here. 
But my white friends couldn't understand what I was talking about." 

Although the Class of 1988 is 17.3 percent people of color and 41.4 
percent female, many women of color perceive Yale as still very male and 
very white. They feel it on an academic level in the number of white 
male professors, the courses and majors offered, the methods of teaching 
and the literature and interpretations of history students read. Most im-
portantly they feel it on the social level in the way whites and people of 
color at Yale communicate or rather, fail to communicate. 

Unable to explain her experiences to her white friends, Ayala fre-
quently visited her floating counselor, a Puerto Rican woman. "The only 
escape we have is among ourselves, because we understand what we're 
feeling, and we know we're not imagining. We can get together and talk 
about it and help each other get through this kind of place," Ayala said. 
"But if you go up to somebody who doesn't understand and they ask you, 
'Well, do you think racism is everywhere?' and you say, 'Yes, it is every-
where,' they say to you, 'Oh, you're just feeling persecuted. You're just 
letting your imagination run away with you.'
