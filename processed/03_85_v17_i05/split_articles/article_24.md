"I have yet to have one Yale woman tell me she does not have a problem 
with food," said Dr. Francy Howland, New Haven psychiatrist and assis-
tant professor at the Yale Medical School. Eating disorders have reached 
epidemic proportions on most college campuses, and Yale is no excep-
tion. According to one estimate, between 35 and 65 percent of college-age 
women suffer from either anorexia (dieting and/or exercising to the point 
of starvation) or bulimia (overeating followed by self-induced vomiting). 

Although the medical origins of anorexia and bulimia remain 
unknown, victims of eating disorders at Yale attribute their diseases to 
three central factors: problems in their own mental health, pressures in 
the University environment, and a society which confmes them in un-
natural roles. 

Weighing 38 pounds more than she did two years ago, Laura looked 
trim and healthy in her layers of running clothes. She spoke with the in-
tensity of a coach who knows it is possible to win a marathon. Laura was 
an obligatory runner, an exercise addict. When an injury sophomore 
year kept her from running, she began dieting and exhibiting signs of 
anorexia. 

"At my worst, I was running four to eight miles in the morning, and 
eight to 12 at night. I saw someone in Mental Hygiene for five sessions. 
When I weighed 100 pounds, I thought I had a problem, but I tried to 
pretend I didn't. I said to him, 'I don't have a problem, do I?' and he said 
no. I walked out of there to my best cross country season ev~r. I made 
All-American, but I paid for it later. My running coach was concerned 
that I was running more than everyone else, but because I was achieving 
something it didn't seem like a mental illness, which in fact was what it 
was. No one thought I had a problem except me." 

When Laura realized she needed help, she took a term off and went 
into psychotherapy, where she gained a series of important insights. "My 
problem is not in my relation to food," she said. "My problem is in me. 
M y obsession with food let me hide that. If your main concern is eating 
and running, more threatening things like classes or getting a job become 
minimwn in importance. Food is something we can control. Many 
women talk of their eating disorders as something that 'happens,' 
something they have no control over. 

"You go in thinking your problem is with food and running, then in 
analysis you see it's really how you feel about yourself, and that takes a 
big adj ustment. The first is more real, the second is less controllable. 
Then you get used to the unsettledness, and you realize you're going to 
get to know yourself." Laura has been in therapy now for a year and a 
half, which she feels is unusually long, though most anorexics need at 
least a year of psychiatric treatment for every year of their disease. 

"They told me I looked 
great, I looked terrific 
and together. And I 
was falling apart inside."
