cw customed to an all-male Yale felt most 
uncomfortable. 

"There really 
is 
a 
dichotomy in my mind between friends 
and women. Women are dates," one 
student commented in Women at Yale, a 
book compiled by two women sociology 
graduate students. "I've never been in a 
situation before where I could have a 
girl as a friend. All the girls you'd meet 
were on weekends in this compulsive 
date situation. And you didn't hav~ 
time to be friends with them. So I don't 
really relate to the girls in my college. I 
don't feel I need to." Such attitudes were 
reinforced by the survival of the 
weekend dating system as a means of 
coping with the lopsided ratio. "H ap-
piness is not Importable" protested ban-
ners hung from some windows. 

Men often had trouble integrating 
their sexual/social life with the rest of 
their college life. "My freshman year 
was beautiful," a sophomore said. 
"Really beautiful. I was never distracted 
during the week and I had this great 
weekt>nd social life. This year has been 
different. I don't get much work done. I 
wish I did, but I don't. I just started see-
ing a Yale coed and I see her constantly, 
constantly. I've gotten no work done 
whatsoever and this has got to stop. I 
mean, something has really got to be 
done about it- I've got to get some 
work done, I really do!" 

"The group which turned out to be 
most opposed to the situation was the 
secretaries and female dining hall 
employees," Chauncey said. "In an all-
male institution, the men at least found 
sisters and mothers in these women and 
occasionally even dated them. Some of 
these people showed real hostility to the 
women students. Master's wives, for ex-
ample, were used to having 400 'sons' 
who adored them and would talk to 
them and now they didn't come around 
anymore." 

"May Day 1970 marked a big turning 
point," Wasserman said. "Suddenly, the 
focus of student energies was external. 
The women participated as equal 
members on a common project. After-
ward they were never as self-conscious 
as before. The novelty of coeducation 
now had a replacement." 

"Yale was dragged, 
kicking and screaming 
into the 20th century." 

M uch progress was made simply by 
the passage of time, with people getting 
used to having women at Yale. Some 
problems took longer and even persist; 
both Sterling Library's Linonia and 
Brothers' reading room and Mory's did 
not admit women until the mid-1970s 
and three senior societies still exclude 
women. In the case of at least one socie-
ty, the exclusion of women resulted 
from a change of the organization's 
charter in 1969 from calling for the selec-
tion of "15 leaders of the junior class" to 
"15 male leaders." 

The Coeducation Office, run by 
Wasserman, coordinated the Universi-
ty's official efforts to facilitate integra-
tion, including resident graduate af-
filiates in each college, a special career 
advisory program and efforts to in-
crease the number of female role models 
and to equalize the male-female ratio. 
Most activism after 1969 focused on 
the ratio. The controversy concerned 
Yale's plan to increase the number of 
wom en by building new housing, rather 
than by reducing the number of men. 
The debate rallied around Brewster's 
alleged guarantee that Yale would pro-
duce "1000 male leaders" a year. 
Brewster denies saying this, and there is 
scant evidence to the contrary, but the 
original plan d id call for maintaining 
the 
number 
of men 
at its 
pre-
coeducation level. When New H aven 
rejected Yale's plan to build two new 
colleges, 
many students and 
ad-
ministrators called for the elimination of 
the quota of 1000 men. In December 
1972 the Corporation voted to admit 
students to the Class of 1978 without 
regard to sex, overcoming the last of-
ficial U niversity obstacle to complete 
coeducation. 


Henry "Sam" Chauncey served as 
coeducation planning director. 
"The' problems of women at Yale to· 
day are the problems of women in socie-
ty, especially in academic society " 
Chauncey said, and two of the fir~t 
three heads of the Coeducation Office 
agree with him. They believe the 
specific difficulties growing out of Yale's 
267 -year all-male tradition are gone. 
Other problems have replaced them, 
but these are shared by society and 
other universities, although Yale still 
bears responsibility for trying to solve 
them. 

Wasserman does not fully agree. 
We've made progress. But there is still 
an all-male quality at Yale that is more 
overwhelming than in society at large. I 
don't think it is prevalent within the 
student body, but in the University. A 
lot of institutional expectations still have 
to change. The tenure structure hasn't 
changed at all; promotion still coincides 
with child-bearing years. Yale is geared 
to a male lifest5'le more than elsewhere. 
It shows up in the expected role of the 
faculty 
wif~-the whole career of a 
faculty member is based on the wife 
washing his shirts, taking care of his 
travel plans and so forth. There are a lot 
of very interesting cultural issues which 
Yale has not addressed; it simply ex-
pects everyone to muddle through." 

. In the 1960s the most clearly ar-
ticulated reasons for coeducation were a 
need to attract high-quality students 
an~ a desire to improve the quality of 
socaal and extracurricular life. Faculty 
also felt coeducation would improve 
classroom learning by broadening 
perspective. Others, like Clark, saw a 
larger issue. "Yale is one of the greatest 
in~titutions in the world, and to deter-
mane that its facilities should be limited 
to half the population by an arbitrary 
rule seemed to me illogical. You could 
see coeducation 
as the final 
culminating step in the process of mak~ 
ing the student body more represen-
tative," Clark said. "There is a certain 
consistency between the two," Brewster 
said, "but it was not plotted. I'm not a 
very good planner." 

Wasserman 
suggested two other 
reasons Yale coeducated. "Overall, the 
500 to 800 women students brought 
money to the University. Little new 
housing was built, virtually no new 
faculty were hired, but Yale got 500 
more tuition and room payments. 
Traditionally, schools in trouble in-
crease enrollment. Yale achieved a 
financial goal and got credit for being 
farsighted. Also, the whole climate of 
the times helped. This place exists in 
society and it mirrors outside changes. 
It can't get too far out of date without 
getting into trouble." 

"Innately the single-sex Yale was 
wrong," Chauncey said. "A lot of us felt 
very strongly about the ethical and 
moral questions, including Brewster. 
But Kingman 
the ultimate 
pragmatist. Coeducation was the se-
cond greatest thing he did for Yale, 
right after getting it through the turmoil 
of the times with positive goals. Initially 
he began without even realizing he 
believed in it, just seeing a practical 
end. He didn't preach great and noble 
thoughts. Getting there in the end was 
what interested him. It was a matter of 
achieving something that if you took the 
moral high-road you probably wouldn't 
have achieved."
