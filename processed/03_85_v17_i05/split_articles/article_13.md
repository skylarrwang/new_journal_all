«TalJc to mry worrum a1 Yale andyou'U. hear a sflJry, a sflJry ahout being a worrum a1

Feminism at Yale does not exist in one place in the way the Philosophy 
Department resides in Connecticut Hall or the H istory Department in 
the Hall of Graduate Studies. Noli can it be defmed as one unified 
ideology or set of beliefs. Yet because feminist politics and activism do 
not have an official voice in the University, cliches and stereotypes are 
often employed to describe the opinions and positions of Yale feminists. 
The two most visible women's organizations, Aurora, Yale's feminist 
magazine, and the Yale Women's Center, have suffered from particular-
ly harsh characterizations. Although neither claims to represent all 
feminists or all women at Yale, both have been accused in the past of 
taking a crudely ideological approach to women's issues. They have been 
called monolithic, extremist and too radical for Yale to take seriously. 
Yet one can hear as many reasons for participation in Women's 
Center activities as there are participants and as many reasons for 
editing and writing for Aurora as there are editors and writers. Nadia 
Tchao, OC '84, who is co-editor of Aurora this semester, asked, "I wonder 
whether we shouldn't stop talking about feminism and start talking about 
feminisms." 

It would have been difficult for Aurora to have indoctrinated Tchao, 
and co-editor Minona Yin, DC '85, into any specific set of beliefs, 
because neither had been heavily committed to the magazine before this 
semester. Yin had never been to an Aurora meeting, and Tchao had been 
to only a few. Both, however, had previously been involved in publishing 
Diakcts, an Asian American women's magazine that appeared as a sup-
plement to Aurora last spring. Because of Aurords non-hierarchical, 
cooperative structure, such personnel changes are not uncommon to the 
magazine and are even encouraged. Tchao says her decision to edit 
Aurora stems in part from her desire to inject it with new ideas. She ex-
plained, "An integral part of feminism is its constant reevaluation of itself 
and constant redefmition of its own terms. Feminists have to question 
themselves in the same way they question the assumptions of others." 
Tchao recognizes her desire to bring new perspectives to Aurora may 
not necessarily lead to a new reception for the magazine on campus. She 
explained, "Both the community that does read Aurora and the com-
munity that doesn't already think they know what Aurora is. It's hard to 
struggle out of that kind of framework." Since its first appearance as a 
supplement to Zirkus in 1979, and its fll'st official publication in 1980, 
Aurora has been labelled a "dyke magazine" and an extremist publication. 
One article it printed four years ago provoked accusations that the 
magazine's editors were "man-haters." 


Tchao 
believes 
people 
resort to these harsh characterizations 
because "It's easy. It's easy to write 
something off as extremist, to label it and 
dismiss it, since then you don't have to 
listen to what it's saying." Aurords art 
editor, Liz Schindler, DC '85, added, 
"It's especially easy to ignore something 
that looks on the outside like it doesn't 
have a lot of power or money behind it." 
Tchao and Schindler dislike placing 
strict definitions on their own feminism 
just as they dislike the glib defmitions so 
often assigned to Aurora. Tchao ex-
plained, "I'm always hesitant to use the 
word radical because it might not mean the 
same thing to the person l'm talking to as 
it does to me." Instead Tchao prefers to 
think of feminism as a process of ques-
tioning traditional assumptions, both her 
own and others. "It comes down to the 
problem of understanding power hierar-
chies, and recognizing your place in 
them," she stated. "To realize the way 
the world works is to realize where you fit 
into that world in terms of power , and 
who's controlling the structure of things. 
Then you might want to ask if that struc-
ture is one you really want to be a part 
of." 
Since the magazine's inception, one of 
Aurords main objectives has been to 
maintain a constant process of question-
ing both itself and the Yale community. 
J essica Peaslee, DC '86, has been on 
Aurords staff for two years and observed, 
"The magazine's tone changes every 
semester, 
because the 
magazine's 
philosophy gets 
redefined 
every 
semester." Susan Moon, DC '86, who 
also works on the magazine's staff, ex-
plained , "A urora is very conscious of the 
information it puts out, and of how peo-
ple will read it." 
Tchao offers her Yale education as 
another example of how one might learn 
to reexailline assumptions. "Yale has ex-
posed me to what is possible in the world 
and yet at the same time has shown me 
what is not possible for me because I'm 
not white and I'm not male. Yale has 
made me painfully aware of who I am 
and who I am not." Schindler has a dif-
ferent memory of becoming a feminist.

She explained, "I never questioned that I 
had the same opportunities as a man, 
and becoming more 'radical' hasn't been 
that big a shift; I've just gained a better 
understanding of things. Feminism has 
made me aware of how people's lives 
have been shaped by roles that have 
already been set up, and I don't want my 
life to be regulated by a series of pre-
existing standards. I want to direct it 
myself, and maybe to go beyond the 
structure of society as it is already set up. 
Paradoxically," she explained, "Yale has 
given me the language to criticize the 
values that it stands for as an institution." 
Unlike Tchao, Sylvia Brownrigg, SY 
'86, began working for Aurora at the 
beginning of her freshman year. By the 
second semester she had become one of 
the magazine's co-editors. Brownrigg ex-
plained that her original attraction to the 
magazine "had to do with the strength 
and powerful convictions of the women 
who were involved. I saw people working 
hard to communicate their ideas. and 
beliefs to other people." Brownrigg does 
not believe the women running Aurora 
and the Women's Center are less com-
mitted now than they were three years 
ago, but does agree the magazine's tone 
has changed in that period of time. 
"When I f1rst carne here," she said, "I 
perceived the lesbian feminist crowd as 
being pretty formative of a lot of the 
feminist politics around here, and I don't 
think that's true anymore." Brownrigg at-
tributes this change partly to the fact that 
gay issues have become more familiar to 
the Yale community than they were in 
the past. "It's not so unusual to be gay 
now, whereas I think five years ago the 
lesbian community was very set apart 
from the rest of the student body." 
Brownrigg does question how deep this 
acceptance runs. "I heard recently that a 
group held an anti-GLAD dance this 
year; so there continues to !:>e a need for a 
lesbian feminist voice at Yale." 
Brownrigg ridicules accusations that 
Aurora was ever an exclusively lesbian 
publication. She points out that although 
the staff has always consisted of gay and 
straight men and women, the magazine's 
re·adership persists in defming the entire 
magazine by its most radical articles, 
often not even reading the others. In the 
Fall 1983 issue, Brownrigg and the 
magazine's other editors consciously at-
tempted to present a broad range of 
issues and ideas aimed at many different 
men and women at Yale. A subsequent 
review in the Yale Daily NewJ panned the 
¢Jltire issue. Brownrigg recalled, "The 
author implied that the inclusion of a 
vocal lesbian politics in one part of the 
magazine meant Aurora would be in-
teresting only to lesbians and that straight 
women would be too threatened to read 
it. 
"People fmd what they want to fmd in 
Aurora. In one editorial 
I 
talked, 
metaphorically' about skin touching other 
skin; the article was making a point about 
race. A friend of mine asked me why I'd 
had to write so explicitly about lesbian 
sexuality-which was not at all the point 
of the article. 
"In any case," Brownrigg continued, 
"there are some ways in which I'm 
vulnerable as a gay woman that are not 
the same as for my straight friends, but 
the broadest range of feminist concerns 
apply equally to straight and gay women. 
A discussion of sexual politics has to go 
beyond the question of who you sleep 
with and begin discussing the exchange of 
power that goes on between any two peo-
ple who are sexually involved." She 
agrees with Tchao and Schindler in 
observing, "People seem to want to link 
Aurora to lesbianism because then they 
think it doesn't apply to them. Fem inism 
encourages both men and women to 
make changes in their everyday lives, and 
I think people are afraid of that." 
As for accusations that Aurora excludes 
men, Brownrigg replied, "I don't feel 
feminism excludes men any more than 
race politics exclucle white people. I think 
some men may feel threatened by 
feminism because it's trying to change 
the status quo. On the other hand," she 
added, "there are men who are sensitive 
to feminist issues on an individual level 
who fmd that feminist politics on a mass 
level excludes them. When someone 
starts talking about masculine values or 
masculine 
structures~ 
they feel
