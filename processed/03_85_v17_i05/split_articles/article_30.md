apathy about sport at Yale. To promote 
women's athletics further, Ryan and the 
SCA are discussing a women's sports 
week in the spring. "There are so many 
sports, so many other demands on our 
leisure time here," Ryan said. "It's the 
same thing at other Ivy League schools. 
With a little luck, we can get some atten-
tion, but we can't manufacture it." 

Lucy: When people start talking about women's 
athletics, everything sounds negaJive, maybe 
because it's all repressed. A lot of women can 
come here and be really happy, not realize they're 
missing anything. The most positive experiencu 
are mack by the athletes themselves. 

George anne: There are good facilitus, good 
coaching. It's an amazing experience. 

Missy: I ftel very positive about my athletic ex-
periLnces here but I have my own feelings, and 
tky're not based on facts, figures and numbers. 
For example the coaches stay in their own 
cubicles. They won~ taJJc with each other. Oh, 
and salaries are taboo. {Former lacrosse and fold 
hocky coach} Robin Cash started breaking the 
silerzas and look where she is now. Whenever 
tMy tkvelop camaradnU, iL's time to move on. 

Last year, much controversy and com-
plaint 
focused 
on the coaching of 
women's athletics. Prior to 1977, most 
coaches of women's sports worked part-
time. Today, only Ice Hockey Coach 
Kathy Lenahan serves on a part-time 
basis. Her captain, Anne Bingham, TC 
'86, enjoys having a woman coach now. 
Yet Lenahan's absence for part of the 
day concerns Bingham. "It's hard to ex-
plain the morale boost you have when 
your coach can dress in the locker room 
with you, when she understands your 
problems. But [former coach] Peter 
Downey was around the rink all the time. 
He was there when recruits dropped in, 
to get phone calls, to talk to the captain at 
lunch time," Bingham said. 

The issue of dual coaching assignments 
troubles many athletes, because they 
think their coaches simply don't have the 
time to provide the attention the team 
needs. 

Assistant coaches' multiple 
assignments often leave them little time 
to recruit. Some sports need assistant 
coaching but go without, such as gym-
nastics, which operates with a one-on-one 
coaching philosophy. 

· 

For every woman coach with several 
assignments, Ryan points to a man in the 
same position. 
He claimed coaches 
receive such assignments because, as full-
time employees, they should work all 
nine months of the academic year. 

After Robin Cash's departure from 
her two head coaching positions, her 
assistant Dale Philippi-Walker took over 
lacrosse. Philippi-Walker, however, also 
coaches squash, and while the lacrosse 
team practices indoors before spring 
break, she must continue with her 
squash responsibilities. She volunteered 
for the lacrosse position, giving the 
Athletic Department time to fmd a per-
manent replacement for Cash. 

Despite their double-duty, woman 
coaches at Yale are paid consistently 
lower than the men. In 1984 the highest 
paid woman coach earned less than 
$30,000, and at least 10 male coaches 
received more than that sum. Moreover, 
the highest paid men's coach took home 
$40,000 more than his female counter-
part. 

"The women are younger, less ex-
perienced. They're starting where the 
men started," Ryan said. "The 
marketplace sets their salaries. The Ivy 
League does painstaking research on 
salaries, and we exchange our salary 
records. Salaries at Yale should be and 
are very competitive in this marketplace. 
We're worried more about equity than 
anything else." 

Missy: A big issue is: to what extent is iL our 
responsihility to point out problems to the ad-
ministraJum? We're athletes, first and foremost, 
and iL's a bummer to realize you're not a priority 
around here. 

Georgeanne: The men's programs are am-
stantly updaJed, but the women must always re-
mind the administration, we have to be the 
squea1cy wheeL 

Missy: The men grl updal.ed but we n«d 
essentials. 

Georgeanne: There dotsn~ seem to be a am-
stant commilmmt to growth here. We lvwe to 
k#J asking them, 'What are your goo1s., 'If you 
confront them, tMy luwe to thmk about you. 

Lucy: They say they're making a commiJmmt 
to be the best in the fl!)ll.Lague. But the women's 
basketball team can~ grow wilhout Jneakrs and 
the ice hockey team can't grow without slraJa. 

"We all buy into the 
idea that men are the 
real athletes and that 
women are somehow 
facsimiles. You really 
have to fight the 
subtleties of sexism."

Left, Captain Lisa Melfi leads the Women's Crew Team. 
Lik with softball and volleyball. They won~ 
mdce volleyballvarsi!JI becau..se they say they can~ 
mdce it ~si!JI all the way.' With sojtba.ll, they 
sltlrled the team on a really inadequate level. 

The controversy over the women's 
volleyball team incorporates many of the 
criticisms about Yale and women's 
athletics. In 1979 the team won the Ivy 
League title and was then cut from varsi-
ty to club level. It lost coaching, use of 
trainers, funding for equipment and 
uniforms and use of the amphitheater for 
home games. Nonetheless, 40 women 
tried out last fall for the squad of 16, and 
the team fmished third in the Ivy 
League, against other teams which have 
the amenities of varsity standing. "Other 
than Dartmouth, which is 10 years 
behind in women's sports anyway, we're 
the only Ivy League team that is club. 
We can't get as far as we want like this," 
said Cathy Robohm, TC '86, co-captain 
of the volleyball team. "Other schools are 
jealous of the talent we have on our team, 
and other volleyball coaches really sup-
port us. But there's only so much 
pressure they can put on our administra-
tion." 

The Athletic Department, however, 
believes varsity volleyball would be too 
expensive, forcing the department to cut 
another sport. Ryan said initiating varsity 
volleyball would cost his department 
$40,000 to $50,000. He foresees an 
overlap of volleyball and basketball 
seasons, which would cause problems in 
the use of the amphitheater. Moreover, 
varsity volleyball would not be well-
received by an Admissions Office which 
feels Yale already has too many varsity 
sports. 

Robohm has heard these objections 
many times in the last three years, and 
she has answers to all of them. If Yale 
cannot afford another varsity sport, she 
does not understand why women's golf, a 
team which must advertise for players, 
was added to- the roster. Robohm has 
presented a petition to the Faculty Com-
mittee on Athletics and will meet with 
them in March. "When they say 'varsity 
all the way,' that includes a lot of ex-
travagance. We're not asking for steak 
dinners at Kline Bio every night, bur only 
for a few advantages of being a varsity 
sport. It's ridiculous for them to quote a 
figure like $50,000 when we're getting by, 
just barely, on $800. They think we want 
a full-time coach, but our old coach would 
come back on a part-time basis," she said. 
"We have only a few of our games at 
home, so it wouldn't be difficult to have 
the basketball 'captain's practices' upstairs 
then. We don't have to do any recruiting 
either, because right now as a club we 
have many more women than we need 
trying out." 

Missy: If there's nothing w hide, why is there a 
silence at the Athletic Department? They should 
publish the athletic budget, disclose coaches 
salaries, becau..se they're not equal, the budgets 
aren't equal. 

Everything comes down to funding. 
Money for pads which fit female ice 
hockey players, for trainers, for assistant 
coaches, for new varsity teams. The 
Athletic Department states it does not 
have the money to spend, while the 
women contend if they were a priority, 
the administration would fmd the capital. 

The athletic budget this year came to 
about $5.5 million, which the six associate 
athletic directors divided. Ryan admitted 
the portion given each team is not equal, 
explaining a budget depends on the costs 
of the individual squad: coaches, travel, 
contests, equipment and recruiting. 

The women, however, see a vicious 
circle in the administration's funding 
philosophy. The department wants to see 
a successful team before it increases its 
budget. The athletes believe the financial 
commitment is necessary before a pro-
gram becomes successful. 

Current athletes and alumni are trying 
to create a fmancial base for themselves, 
either through the formation of alumni 
associations or endowments. Last fall 
Yale endowed women's crew after alumni 
raised $54,000 since 1979. Women's crew 
is part of the larger, wealthy Yale Crew 
Association, which has paid for much of 
the women's expenses over the last few 
years. "If we wanted to go to Florida in 
the spring, we had to get money from 
our parents and friends. Men's crew 
shared their money with us, but we still 
had to ask them for it," recalled Anne 
Boucher, '81, chairperson for the endow-
ment. "Other alumni associations are 
reluctant to give money they've saved for 
the men to the women, but they don't 
realize they will get 100 new members 
that way." 

As Boucher works within the system to 
improve crew, Ernst urges women 
athletes to do all they can for their teams, 
in and out of the system. She believes 
Yale will move only if pushed and em-
harassed. "Athletics is a sensitive spot, 
the nerves are rawer there. Sports are 
not as socially acceptable as simply study-
ing, for women at Yale. There's the at-
titude, 'You girls aren't serious about 
sports. If you are, there's something 
wrong with you,"' Ernst said. "Coaches 
can't argue or they'll get ftred. But 
students can't get fired. Unless you get 
political, you won't be able to play your 
sport the way you want." 

Nancy Harthun, CC '87, walks in and sits 
across from Lucy, next w the couch. She listens 
intently as the older women talJc about Frank 
Ryan, the thpartmental bureaucracy, the search 
for a new associate directJJr of athletics w replaa 
Kit Morris. 

Naricy: The administrative sysfml is a mess. 
It's a shabby operation from wp w botWm. Few 
of the teams have managers. 
There's no 
organization -when I come w a game I don't 
know what I should be doing as a manager. 
The detaiLs 
don~ work, and that distracts 
athletes. 

Georgeanne: We're hoping w get a wom411 as 
the new associate directJJr. Maybe that wiU 
"revolutionize"' things. (She looks at Missy who 
has sat quietly for several minutes.) 

Missy: I'm just thinking about the future of 
women's athletics here. The women are more 
conservative, maybe complaant. I don~ want w 
lose things, but that's e.xrutly what I'm t:ifraid of 
I'm one of the last who saw the bad old days of 
women's sports here. I was here with people 
who did the TiLle IX strip. People now don~ 
reali.u the pain, anger and hard work those 
women went through so athletics wouldn't be se-
cond class. There's no forgetting our hisWry, but 
some have already forgotten . Some never knew.
