•1 think the way it got out did more 
than anything to postpone coeducation 
by 10 years," H owe said. "The Presi-
dent's Office was swamped with letters 
from disgruntled alumni. The only 
significant development that came out 
of my suggestion was an increased 
awareness of the possibility." 

Other changes were already taking 
place, though. "Yale in the 1950s was 
overwhelmingly prep school, wealthy 
and Eastern," Chauncey said. "In my 
class I remember one student from 
California and one black student. It's 
extraordinary how parochial it was." In 
1965 R . lnslee 'Inky' Clark, Jr., '57, 
the new dean of admissions, aimed to 
change that. "I wanted to strengthen 
and deepen the applicant pool to secure 
stronger representation from groups not 
traditionally in it," Clark said. "Then 
the Admissions Committee would be 
able to find the strong applicants need-
ed to diversify the student body." 

•Inky beat the bushes in areas Yale 
not really approached before," said 
Kingman Brewster Jr., then Yale's 
president. The number of public-
a:bool, minority, and non-East Coast 
ltudents at Yale increased as a result. 
~ile only 44 percent of the Class of 
!1963 attended public school, 61 percent 
r
the Class of 1971 had gone to such 
ools. 

The possibility of including women 
this diversification arose in March 
1966 when the 
Yale Corporation 
declared its interest in establishing a 
coordinate college for women separate 
from Yale College within the Universi-
~· similar to arrangements between 
narvard and Radcliffe and other Ivy 
:League universities. Brewster's desire to 
a link between Yale and Vassar 
all.lcilleges apparently spurred this move . 
._._:Brewster and Vassar President Alan 
--.Jp80n dreamt .the whole idea up," 
Chauncey said. "In the mid-1960s the 
bwo became personal friends through 
· wives. Simpson once remarked 
aaar had no future as a small 
men's college in the face of other 
lchools' coeducation and 
mounting 
fmancial pressures on quality. The two 
proposed the Vassar campus move to 
Yale.•

In December the Yale Corporation 
and the Vassar trustees formally agreed 
to study the project's feasibility. At 
Vassar the study's announcement met 
with 
frenzied jubilation. 
Students 
serenaded Simpson with "Boola, Boola" 
and "The Whiffenpoof Song," draped 
their windows with banners reading 
"Beat H arvard" and "For Sale" and 
changed Vassar's "Wisdom and Purity" 
motto to "Wisdom and Men" and Yale's 
to "For God, for Country, for Yale and 
Vassar." Vassar alumnae and faculty 
were less jubilant. T hey did not want to 
give up their campus and tradition and 
feared the college would lose its in-
dependence in a large, highly respected 
research university like Yale. 

In New H aven the proposal met 
favorable but subdued reaction. A YDN 
poll the year before had found students 
felt four-to-one that women "would im-
prove Yale," while faculty agreed by 
nine-to-one. Rumors circulated that 
freshman physical education had been 
dropped that year as part of a plan to 
abandon the gym and convert it into 
Vassar's New Haven campus. The Yale 
Precision Marching Band divided into 
"'¥" and "V" formations and tried to 
consummate the 
relationship 
pre-
maturely during a halftime show. Each 
residential college affiliated with a 
Vassar house and held numerous joint 
events. (Lathrup H ouse's 14-7 defeat of 
Berkeley in touch football may have 
raised second thoughts among Yale 
students.) 

According to the study committee's 
tentative plan, Yale would build a new 
Divinity School behind Pierson ("The 
Div students wanted to be downtown 
where the action was in poverty and 
social activism," Chauncey remem-
bered) and Vassar would move into the 
Divinity School and surrounding area. 
•we trooped up Science HiU with the 
Vassar Board of Trustees to show them 
the trees," Chauncey said. "They con-
sidered Vassar's beautiful trees an im-
portant asset and we had to find a 
similar site here." Despite intricate 
plans for coordinating classes and 
preserving each college's independence, 
Vassar ultimately rejected the proposal 
in November.
