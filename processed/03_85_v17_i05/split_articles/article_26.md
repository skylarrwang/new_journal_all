"I'm exhilarated and fascinated by the 
self-knowledge I've gained, so I stay in 
it," she said. "In some ways I'm glad I 
had the problem because I learned 
about myself, but sometimes I think 
there's got to be a better way." 


As her therapy progressed 
Laura 
returned to a normal weight. "Getting 
better is hard," she admitted. "First of 
all, it's much easier to lose weight 
because then you feel directly good 
about your body. When you gain 
weight 
you 
feel 
horrible, 
though 
everyone says, 'Isn't it wonderful? 
You're getting better!' No, you're get-
ting fat." She seemed to spit the word 
out. 


While most anorexics or bulimics at 
Yale have suffered from the diseases for 
seven or eight years. se,·eral believe that 
the roots of their problems lie not only 
in themselves but also in the University 
environment. "Anorexia is a manifesta-
tion of a larger form of discrimination 
which at Yale has a lot to do with being 
a woman," Diane said. She sat cross-
legged, sipping tea in her stylish, sunny 
apartment. A drawing of a woman's 
torso hung on the refrigerator door. 


"The average freshman comes to 
Yale and he feels as if he's given a cer-
tain amount of authority. and he 
defines himself in relation to it. She, I 
should say. She feels powerless, not in 
control. It's not enough just to b~. when

everyone's so perfection-oriented. 
When women to start to control their 
bodies, it's equated with success. People 
complimented me when I got skinnier, 
they told me I looked great, I looked 
terrific and together. And I was falling 
apart inside. 


"When you arrive here, it's the first 
time you have adult or sexual respon-
sibilities, or lack of them, and you 
become conscious of sexual attraction, 
what 'sexy' is and all of a sudden, what 
you have to be. I had a boyfriend 
freshman year who told me every night 
what parts of my body he thought were 
too fat. I felt horribly guilty that I hadn't 
noticed it before. 


"I became more and more conscious 
of my body and my eating habits. I 
thought he was to blame because he 
couldn't see bevond that sort of thing in 
me, but he was expressing a widely and 
unconsciouslY held belief, that women 
aren't meant 'to be the way they natural-
ly are-curvy and round." 


In adjusting to Yale's competitive 
life, Diane began to judge herself 
against her ideal view of body, and her 
weight dropped to 90 pounds. "You feel 
your body can never be good enough, 
therefore you can never be good 
enough. The anorexic really does feel 
she's controlling her problems when 
she's out in the world, but she goes 
home and bottoms out. She can always 
be more thin or more successful." 


Unable to cope with her problem 
alone, Diane moved in with a friend the 
second semester of her sophomore year. 
"One night at around 3 a.m. my friend 
took me to DUH [Department of 
Undergraduate Health, 
the former 
name of University Health Services 
(UHS)) because I just couldn't deal. I 
talked to the person there in a way I 
hadn't talked to anyone in weeks. They 
put me upstairs, and I looked down 
tfrom the fifth floor and said I'm never 
going back to that horrible place that 
made me feel so bad." She took a year 
off 
and 
went 
into 
therapy. 


Howland believes the pressures of 
college often intensify problems with 
food. "I treat an enormous amount of 
women at Yale with eating disorders," 
she said, sitting in her Trumbull Street 
"The dining halls are 
disastrous for anyone 
who has problems with 
food." 
three-room "office," complete with 
balcony, fully-equipped kitchen and 
brass candlesticks over the hearth. The 
decor makes her patients feel more at 
home, less institutionalized. She treats 
close to 45 anorexics or bulimics. 


"I think eating disorders have reached 
epidemic proportions on most college 
campuses, and Yale is probably worse 
than most. You have sensitive, am-
bitious women here. Many women at 
Yale unconsciously identify with their 
fathers, and they haven't come to terms 
with how to nurture themselves. They 
haven't internalized their mothers. At 
Yale they come to internalize the man's 
world, and Yale is very male. Yale 
places large demands- there is a need 
to perform, a need to pretend, a need to 
sell yourself to the purpose of produc-
tion. Some people ftll the void sym-
bolically through food. There are so 
many women at Yale who deny that 
they have any emotional needs at all." 


One bulimic voiced a similar opinion: 
"You had to be compulsive to get in 
here, and once you get here you have to 
be compulsive again."

**Title: Dietary Diseases**
**Page number(s): 47**

Anorexia nervosa is a disease nf self-
starvation. Anorexics often lose up to 25 
percent of their bod>· weight through 
dieting or fanatic exercise. In extreme 
cases, muscle and digestive systems 
deteriorate to the point where the pa-
tient's body can no longer accept 
nutrients. Victims of bulimia will binge 
on excessive quantities of food, then 
purge 
their systems 
through 
self-
induced vomiting. Both diseases are 
r,>bsessive forms of addiction. In both. 
laxatives or diuretics are used to in-
crease weight Joss. The mortality rate 
for anorexics is two to three percent. 
It is 
twice as high 
for bulimics. 


''There are a lot of mtnor symptoms 
that indicate you might have an eating 
disorder," one anorexic woman explain-
ed. "Are there certain foods you will 
never eat? Do you eat the same foods 
every day, and do rou have anxiety 
before and guih after a meal? Do you 
dislike your body? When you exercise 
do you think of the amount of calories 
you are burning. instead of enjoyin'{ the 
activity? Do you ever fast or make 
yourself throw up? Is it important to 
you to have a real sense of control 
around food, and are vou conscious of 
that?" Another anore;ic said. ~People 
define eating disorders in much too 
strict terms- are you a skeleton? do you 
put your finger down your throat? But 
af you are so concerned about food. you 
ould deal with the problem before it 
ruins the quality of your life."

they've done and that it aflccts the ma-
jority of women on campus- usuall}' 
the prettiest, the brightest, most engag-
ing and exhubcrant, the most com-
petitive ones." 


The disease varies in intensitv. '"I 
treated one bulimic at Yale who had a 
$200-a-day addiction for six week:-;," 
Howland said. -she would binge only 
the best food, and she would throw up 
72 times a day. She did nothin~ but 
that. It's more typical to do it three to 
seven times a day, in addition to keep-
ing down betwet•n two and five meals." 


Serious complications can result from 
the disease. "There is a danger of heart 
attack and rupture of the stOmach or 
esophagous," 
Howland said. "The 
enamel of your teeth can also be damag-
ed. :-.;o system is unaffected in the case 
of anorexia or bulimia: the kidney, the 
liver, 
the heart muscles 
and tht• 
menstrual cycle. You have a hard time 
learning and can read the same thing 
over and over again and not understand 
it.~ According to one bulimic. ''] don't 
think I'd have done anything about my 
problem or gone for help if I hadn't 
thought about the damage it does. Pt·o-
ple say that if you have bulimia rou 
might not be able to have children." 


Students who are concerned about 
their own eating problems or those of a 
friend are encouraged to sc.·ek help. The 
Student Self-Care Exchange at Univer-
sity H ealth ~rvices provides informa-
tion on various eating disorders, as dot:s 
Overeaters Anonymous. Complete 
recovery often r~quires psychiatric help. 
~A woman with an eating disorder tend!!

Howland said.
