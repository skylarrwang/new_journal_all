Women's Work at Yale Wins Respect 
By Lucinda Finley 
The contract ratified last week between Yale University 
and Local34 of the Federation of University Employees represents 
one of the most successful forays to date by the labor movement 
into women-dominated sectors of the white-collar work force. 

Most unions have devoted insufficient attention to organizing 
white-collar workers, and when they have attempted to do so they 
have often failed to adapt their message to the needs of women. 
They have also met with resistance from white-collar 
employees who do not want to be associated with a male-and blue-
collar oriented organization. The Yale union adopted from the 
outset a grassroots, democratic approach, with the seeds of the 
organization coming from within. The union's agenda came from 
the workers, so the union was sensitive to the concerns of the 
largely female work force. 

The clerical workers felt that they were not getting the respect 
or recompense that they deserved for their contribution to the 
educational enterprise at Yale. 

This low status was evidenced by wages far lower than the male 
blue-collar workers' wages and insufficient to support a family, a 
salary structure that kept women clustered in low labor grades and 
gave no rewards for longevity of service, a meager pension plan and 
often disdainful treatment by administrators and supervisors. 

The contract addresses each of these concerns, through an 
across-the-board wage increase, a system of salary step increase for 
years of service at Yale, significant improvement in the pension 
formula, and procedures for reviewing job classifications, promotions 
and layoffs. 

The contract is the culmination of a union's efforts to address 
the issue of comparable worth. At Yale, administrative assistants 
who ran entire departments and lab technicians responsible for 
experiments conducted under valuable grants often earned less 
than the mostly male workers who drive trucks and perform 
maintenance services for Yale. 

According to the union, the salary disparities existed, not 
because their jobs were less important or entailed less responsibility, 
but because their jobs have traditionally been viewed as women's 
work. 

Economics professor Raymond...? performed a statistical 
analysis that suggested salary disparities across job rankings 
between women and minorities and other workers, disparities that 
could not be explained away by factors such as differences in 
education, years of service, and job responsibility. 

Not only will the across-the-board salary increases in the Yale 
contract bring the salaries in male and female job categories closer 
together, but the provision for annual increases is designed to 
bring the salaries of currently undervalued workers more in line 
with their actual responsibilities and professional development. 

All of this has been achieved without 
reducing the salaries in the predominantly 
male job categories. 

All of this has been achieved without reducing the salaries in 
the predominantly male job categories, thus calling into question 
the stock retort that any comparable worth wage gain for women 
workers will have to come at the expense of men. 

But could the debilitating 10-week strike have been avoided? 
If, after weeks of insisting that it could not spare another penny, Yale 
finally found more to give in the waning days before the deadline 
for a second strike, why couldn't it have made these proposals in 
September? 

Some members of the union negotiating team testified to a 
markedly different attitude displayed by the university negotiators in 
the past few weeks, an attitude evincing a palpable desire to achieve 
an agreement. 

Despite public pronouncements by the Yale administration that 
the educational process was not being hampered, many of us who 
are an integral part of that process know that the contrary is true. 
Many classes, including most at the law school, were moved off 
campus to locations of varying inconvenience. Class time was lost 
as students shuttled around town. 

My classes in labor law and torts, for example, were held in an 
office building near the Palace Theater on College Street in New 
Haven, with construction noises outside the window. I also taught in 
the living room of a peace organization, complete with chairs in 
various stages of losing their springs and stuffing and two large cats 
that insisted on climbing on my shoulders every time I was about to 
make a serious point. We quickly moved out of there. 

Those whose classes remained on campus found that some 
students would not attend rather than engage in the crisis of 
conscience of crossing a picket line. Thus, some students had a 
semester on tape, a diversity of views was missing from the 
classroom, and classes were polarized along largely political lines. 

The interchange of ideas, formal and informal, that is so 
important to the scholarly and educational process, broke down. 
Speakers and workshops were canceled. With no dining halls, and 
classes scattered, opportunities for students to see each other and to 
see faculty were limited. The few hallway or streetcorner 
encounters with colleagues that did occur focused on the strike, 
rather than on scholarly ideas. 

In some departments, junior faculty and teaching assistants 
reported that they had been pressured not to take actions that could 
be viewed as supportive of the union. Many faculty members now 
doubt whether Yale is seriously committed to the principles of 
open exchange of ideas and academic freedom that it espoused in 
its public communications during the strike. 

One can only hope that the administration learns from the 
demoralizing experience of the strike. As a professor of labor 
relations law, I was sometimes dismayed by the way the process was 
conducted. 

At the outset of negotiations, the rumor was that the university 
team was not taking the workers' concerns seriously, and was not 
making much of an effort to respond to proposals. 

I attended several negotiating sessions last spring and summer 
as a faculty observer, and what I saw verified the rumors. At the first 
session, I detected an audible expression of relief from some 
members of the university negotiating team that there were no 
faculty members in attendance. That day the observers' chairs were 
all occupied by women. The negotiators' faces looked startled 
when, at the day's end, I introduced myself as a law professor and 
two other young women identified themselves as faculty members. 

Throughout other sessions, the university team met every 
union proposal not with discussion, but with "we'll have to get back 
to you on that." They did not get back on most issues. 

This is not too surprising, since the administration did not send 
anyone into the negotiating room with the authority to commit Yale 
until the last few weeks. This is a cardinal mistake in labor 
negotiations. In order to achieve a contract each side has to have at 
the table a representative who has the authority to agree and to offer 
compromises or to make counteroffers that can be fulfilled. 

The administration committed another labor negotiations mistake 
by taking a strong public stance against binding arbitration. Yale 
also publicly committed itself to its late September offer as its final 
offer. When either side in a labor negotiation takes its positions 
beyond the table to the public as an absolute, it is often left with little 
or no room to compromise. Saving face can sometimes become 
more important than settling a contract. 

One can only hope that the lessons learned from the strike will 
be lasting and that Yale's sorry history of strikes to achieve labor 
contracts will end. Unions do not necessarily mean an end to 
stability, productivity and harmony in a work force. Indeed, recent 
scholarly empirical work demonstrates that it is often management's 
response to unions that is more determinative of work-place 
dynamics than the mere presence of the union. 

A management that is disdainful to union representatives, that 
fails to explain its concerns and deal with theirs, even after a union 
has won an election, may only produce for itself an embittered work 
force that is all the more willing to use economic pressure. 

Yale, however, can be considered a winner in this labor 
dispute. Indeed, the university should be proud, as an institution 
seeking new solutions to societal problems, to have concluded a 
contract that represents a gain in dignity, wage comparability and 
power over their own working lives for traditionally under-
appreciated and undervalued women white-collar workers.
