young enough to be a student. Her cur-

"I ended up coming to Yale for all 
sorts of nondescript reasons," Fine said 
between bites of a peanut butter and jel-
ly sandwich. Her two primary interests 
freshman year were music-she played 
the french horn with the Yale and the 
New Haven symphonies- and . medi-
cine. Yet Fine's experiences in science 
courses and her perceptions of Yale's at-
titude toward women became increas-
ingly negative. By the end of her 
sophomore year she decided to move off 
campus and to forgo her medical school 
aspirations. "It was devastating being 
one of 10 women in a lecture hall with 
200 aggressive, intimidating men from 
intense prep schools. It was equally in-
timidating not even knowing those nine 
other women," she explained. Fine feels 
Yale made no effort to create a support 
system for the first women under-
graduates. "The arrival of women pro-
vided a lot of news for The New York 
Times, and I had a sense we were being 
evaluated on an ongoing basis," Fine 
asserted. "Yale thought painting the 
bathrooms in Vanderbilt pretty colors 
and putting up full-length mirrors was 
adequate, but it was really more subtle 
than that." 

Fine believes sequestering all the 
women in Vanderbilt Hall on Old 
Campus only served to create feelings of 
insularity and alienation. "There was a 
funny dichotomy. Yale placed a guard 
under the Vanderbilt arch 24 hours a 
day, but the man was usually in-
ebriated. We felt like Rapunzel in her 
tower, but Yale assumed our needs to 
be identical to any previous students'," 
Fine said strongly. "We were goldfish in 
a bowl. It was easy to feel sort of special, 
but it was very difficult to develop a 
sense of female camaraderie. Faculty 
members didn't stop reminding us they 
couldn't walk around naked in the gym 
anymore." 

While she admits to having been "a 
little on the stuffy side politically" dur-
ing high school, Fine embraced some 
controversial issues at Yale to a much 
greater extent than either Riley or 
Horowitz. "Students really carried a 
feeling of responsibility to address the 
world's woes," she remembered. "The 
desire to provide a service for the com-
munity-to be a teacher-was respec-
ted in the 1960s. Then, if someone said 
he wanted to go into banking, he'd pro-
bably be stoned." Fine's extensive in-
volvement in the Yale Women's Center 
and the Women's Abortion Referral 
Service rejuvenated her interest in 
medicine. "It was virtually impossible 
for women to get abortions in Connec-
ticut. Our group was composed of Yale 
undergrads and New Haven women 
who were concerned with feminist 
issues," 
Fine observed.

discovered a group of women to talk 
and share ideas with." 

Fine spent senior year fulfilling pre-
med requirements and in the fall she 
entered the Yale School of Medicine. 
"I've always been 
interested 
in 
gynecology, and the feminist movement 
helped me get in touch with those in-
terests," Fine said, finishing her sand-
wich. "It's really important now for 
women to enter this field. I've been able 
to remain involved in feminism from a 
political point of view as well as dealing 
with women's health issues." Fine cur-
rently teaches Yale medical students 
and works with new residents. 

Living in Hamden with her two 
children and her husband, a surgeon 
who works with Horowitz, Fine is slow-
ly coming to terms with her critical 
perceptions of Yale. "In some ways Yale 
is a microcosm of the real world," Fine 
asserted, glancing at her watch. "There 
still remains an elitist quality at Yale, 
and part of that elitism is sexism. Even 
today when people hear the word Yale, 
there is on some level the image of a 
male institution." A pregnant woman 
holding the hand of a small boy peeked 
through the doorway of Fine's office. 
"Well, it looks like it's back to patients," 
Fine said, smiling as the mother and 
child entered the room.
