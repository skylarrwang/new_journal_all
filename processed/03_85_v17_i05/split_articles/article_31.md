When Sandra Boynton tells you she is happy with her life, believe her. 
She has a right to feel that way. The 31-year-old artist and humorist is 
the acknowledged genius in her field, lives on a beautiful 40-acre farm in 
Lakeville, Connecticut which she bought herself, and supports her hus-
band and three young children. Boynton draws greeting cards for a living 
and has been doing so ever since she graduated from Yale in 1974. 
Her artwork, replete with rare and bizarre animals like chocolate-
loving pigs, heartbroken ewes and sourpuss cats, 
is instantly 
recognizable. Those animals, combined with Boynton's appealing wry 
humor, have made the unpretentious artist an industry phenomenon. 
Over 100 million of her cards are sold every year, "mostly to friends and 
family," according to Boynton. Add to that astonishing figure all the 
calendars, mugs, T-shirts and so on that Boynton devotees purchase and 
it becomes clear Sandra Boynton is big business indeed. 
"If I had to apply to Yale again and I said on my application my goal in 
life was to draw greeting cards, they would never accept me," said Boyn-
ton, a slim woman with straight brown hair, freckles and an appealing 
smile. Luckily for Yale, when Boynton applied in 1969 she had no such 
ambition. Instead she wanted to be a director and eventually wound up 
majoring in English. "I took virtually no art courses while I was at Yale," 
Boynton remembered. "At the time, that department was just not very 
good, and besides it was geared towards graduate students. The English 
Department, on the other hand, was just fantastic." 


Boynton looks back on her time at Yale during the U niversitys initial 
years of coeducation as a very positive experience, with only a few reser-
vations. "There were undeniably some disadvantages in being a woman 
here in that changeover period," she recalled. "For me, the most difficult 
time was freshman year, and I think that was true for most of us. All the 
women were in Vanderbilt, which was an WlCOmfortable situation 
because it was so much like a fortress. As for the men ... well, with the 
male-to-female ratio as high as it was, you tended to meet only the men 
who were pretty sure they were the guys you'd want to know. Only after 
freshman year did we realize not all Yale men were like that." 


Indeed, Boynton would end up marrying one of those men she met 
after freshman year, an Olympic canoer named Jamie McEwan. They 
met while he was a junior in Saybrook and she was a senior in Calhoun. 
The two were able to maintain their relationship after Boynton 
graduated, but did not decide to marry until several years later when 
their lives had settled down.· 


It was in that first summer after 
graduation when Boynton, who had 
drawn since childhood, discovered her 
natural talent as an artist could be 
parlayed into profit. She was waitress-
ing to earn money for the Berkeley 
School of Drama, which she would at-
tend that fall, when she decided there 
had to be a better way to finance her 
education. 
"My sister 
Pam 
made 
jewelry and sold it in local stores," 
Boynton said, "so I thought I would 
make use of whatever talent I might 
have. Painting cards was the only way I 
could think of to make money. Plus. at 
the time it was really an open market; 
there certainly weren't many greeting 
cards that I would have bought. As it 
turned out, the market was a lot more 
open than I had thought." 


All told, Bovnton would receive 
orders for 120,000 of her cards, orders 
she had to fill in time for Christmas. 
She hand painted 60,000 cards that 
summer, 
working at 
assembly-line 
speed to crank out up to four of them a 
minute, and was able to get an uncle to 
print the next batch of 60,000. Having 
seen that people not only liked her cards 
but were willing to pay for them, Boyn-
ton's next step was to take 27 of her 
designs to an industry trade show. 
There she ran into problems. Industry 
representati+:s wanted her designs, but 
they also wanted more control over her 
work than Boynton was willing to relin-
quish. They wanted her to name her 
animals, to put bows on their heads and 
to get rid of the white backgrounds 
which she knew made her cards stand 
out on retailers' shelves. White cards get 
dirty, and store owners would never 
buy them, Boynton was informed. The 
final straw for the young artist came 
when she learned she would have to sell 
her designs at a flat rate rather than 
maintain ownership and receive 
royalties on their sales. For Boynton, 
there was little point to marketing her-
cards if they weren't going to look like 
she wanted them to, and she left the 
show without a company to merchan-
dise her art. 


"I was very lucky," Boynton said 
about that decision. "Frankly, I didn't 
need the money badly enough to give 
up control of my work. It was a for-
tunate luxury to say, 'I'll do this on my 
own terms or I won't do it at all."' 


A luxury, perhaps, but the desire to 
retain final control over her art would 
become a constant in Boynton's career 
thereafter. It is not that Boynton is ar-
rogant- she isn't- it is just very impor-
tant to her that commercial pressures 
never force her to lower the quality of 
her work. The timing was perfect, then, 
for Boynton to meet a representative of 
Recycled Paper Products, a 
small 
greeting card company with the flex-
ibility to allow Boynton the kind of con-
trol she wanted. Anonymous animals, 
white backgrounds -and royalties were 
not going to keep Recycled Paper from 
signing Boynton to a contract. In the 10 
years since, Boynton has drawn over 
2500 designs for Recycled Paper and 
company 
revenues have 
risen 
to 
somewhere in the neighborhood of S40 
million. Boynton cards account for 
almost half of that sum. "Other com-
panies have tried to woo me away," 
Boynton concedes today, "but there's no 
reason why I should go. This company 
has been ,·ery good to me." 


With her new contract. Boynton headed 
to California as planned, but she found 
Berkeley too "alien" and returned to 
New H aven. Back at Yale, she enrolled 
at the Drama School in the Doctor of 
Fine Arts program. "At the time," she 
said, "that program was sort of a black 
sheep, 
a 
concession 
to academia. 
Neither the teachers nor the students 
were of the same high quality I'd come 
to expect when I was an under-
graduate." Disappointed and frustrated , 
Boynton quit the program after a year 
and a half to marry McEwan and pur-
sue a full-time career with Recycled 
Paper. It was a decision she has never 
had cause to regret. 


Boynton 
seems 
handle 
her 
phenomenal success with the same kind 
of warm humor she displays in her 
cards. Laughing, she said, "In some 
people's minds I'm extraordinarily 
famous; other people have absolutely no 
idea who I am. That may be because 
I've never done TV specials and I don't 
have a line of licensed Sandra Boynton 
footwear. It's very easy for me to feel or-
dinary. I mean, it's certainly not like 
I'm Meryl Streep and people come 
rushing up to me in Burger King to tell 
me how much they loved my last 
movie." She paused and added, "I am 
relatively anonymous and I like it that 
wav. I don't think I'd ever want to 
ch~nge that." 


Boynton is particularly fortunate in 
that while commercial success has not 
brought her unwanted attention, it has 
given her the money to live a quiet, 
comfortable rural life with her husband 
and children. H er marriage seems 
almost suspiciously blissful; Boynton 
herself is more than willing to admit it 
is, at the verv least, 
"unorthodox.~
