Letting the women rowers sit in the bus was not a good idea. They had 
just fmished rowing on the Derby and were drenched now by the river 
water and freezing rain of the late winter evening in 1975. Then they 
followed the same old routine: the men showered in the boathouse and 
dressed in warm clothes while the women stayed in their waterlogged 
sweats, waiting to return to Payne-Whitney because they had no shower 
facilities. 

The promised renovation of the boathouse was delayed for fmancial 
reasons, so the women sat on the bus as they had every fall and spring 
for the last three years. But this time they started talking. "What are we 
going to do?" someone fmally asked. 

"Let's go take a shower in Joni Barnett's Office." Barnett, now an 
associate secretary of the University, served as the director of women's 
athletics. 

"No, let's not get too destructive here." The women were not going to 
shower in Barnett's office, but they would make their point. They 
wanted everyone to know the oonditions under which they practiced and 
oompeted. The women felt ignored by the Athletic Department, viewing 
Barnett as a figurehead or buffer between them and the administration. 

Chris Ernst, '76, looked at her friend Ann Warner, '77, and said "I 
dare you to." It was that simple. The plan was sealed, set. 

Ernst made an appointment with Barnett, and a week later, she and 
18 teammates went to Barnett's office dressed in their sweats. There, 
they stripped before the administrator, each woman with the words "Ti-
tle IX," for the legislation which assured equality in education, written in 
blue magic marker across her chest and back. A Yale Daily News 
photographer who also worked for The New York Tunes stood on a chair 
behind the women, capturing the look on Barnett's face as the naked 
Ernst read her statement. Because the Tunes had a slow news week, the 
paper printed the photograph, reported the incident and generally left 
Yale embarassed. 

Following a national trend in the 1970s and the ratification of Title IX, 
women's athletics at Yale grew in both success and range. The rowers 
now have shower facilities in Derby, women here play lacrosse and ice 
hockey, make AD-American for cross-country and basketball. In between 
practices and early morning lifts, some women athletes speak frequently 
about their dissatisfaction with Yale's treatment of women's sports. Like 
the crew team in March 1975, these women criticize the Athletic Depart-
ment while working to chapge it. 

"Unless you get 
political, you won't be 
able to play your sport 
the way you want."
