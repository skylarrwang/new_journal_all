Yet the status of women's athletics can 
be interpreted and explained in a variety 
of ways. Athletes, alumni, coaches, ad-
minstrators: each group, and often each 
pers~m in the group, has a different view 
of Yale's dedication to women in sports. 
There are no clear, unbiased accounts of 
women's athletics here, rather a variety 
of voices, often urgent and adamant, 
from which to choose. 

&me: Pierson common room. Brown tufted 
leaJher chairs and, on one wall, a huge portraiJ 
of a tum-oj"-the-century football player. A /ale-
evening study break of the Yale Women ~ Athletic 
Association (YWAO) disintegrates, people leav-
ing in groups of two and three. Near the en-
trance to the room, thru of last year's officers 
ga/Mr. President Georgeanne NaJJress, PC '85, 
and Vice President of GmlXUICes Missy Parks, 
TC '85, sit on a couch, Vice President Lucy 
&mlwlz, CC '85, reclines in an armchair. 

Missy: Freshman year, I thought the women 
wlw cvmplained were paranoid. But there~ no 
going back now. I've gained a certain con-
cioUSMss o/ virtue of my experience with the ad-
ministraJWn and several really dynamic women. 

Georgeanne: I was so angry freshman year. I 
mnember fold hocky was inviud to a post-
season tournament. 
That~ when I realized the 
reallacJc of communicaiion between the Athletic 
54 The New Journal/ March I. 1985 
Department and the teams. Our coach was mak-
ing arrangements to go, but the administration 
didn't even know we were near qualifying and 
so told us we couldn't participate. Harvard, wlw 
was ranked below us with a worse record, went 
in OUT place. 

Unlike Nattress, most women athletes do 
not begin their Yale careers with disillu-
sionment. They arrive to fmd a large, 
well-equipped gym, Coxe Cage and a 
history of successful teams. Although 
preparing to try out for the national crew 
squad, 
Nattress's successor , 
Sarah 
Carlson, BK '86, carne to Yale initially as 
a basketball player. She was quickly im-
pressed with the pre-game meals, the 
payment of hotel expenses, the funding 
for her team. Her vice president, Pia 
Sass, SM '86, has also played several 
sports here, begirming as a field hockey 
player. "For field hockey, Yale always 
seemed one of the best places to play. It 
had a nice field, good coaching and a 
good team," Sass said. "I was defmitely 
impressed with program. In fact, for the 
first year and a half, I was impressed 
with all athletics at Yale. I heard no com-
plaints." 

Gradually, 
after talking to older 
athletes or looking at the men's teams, 
Carlson and Sass realized the inade-
quacies of the women's athletic program. 
Like so many women before them they 
ask the crucial question: is Yale's Athletic 
Department 
committed to 
women's 
sports? "Commitment" entails funding, 
use of facilities, promotion, varsity status 
of sports, coaching. But the word also en-
compasses opinion, communication and 
attitudes toward women athletes. 

' ' Missy: (leaning forward, toward Georgeanne) 
We all buy into the idea that men are the real 
athletes and that women are somelww facsimiles. 
You reOJly have In fight the subtleties of sexism. 

Georgeanne: (quietly) WiJhin and without 
you. 

Missy: 'lnis plaa is still racist and sexist. 

Georgeanne: WiJh big letlers. 

Missy: 17le schedule posters are a pnftct t.llll17l· 
ple of how the Athletic Department Si9'S "Yes, 
yes" and never gets anything done. 11ley used to 
have a sandwich board out in front of Ray 
Tompkins House wiJh the men:r bask.dhaJl 
scores postd on it.. One woman got angry 
because the women~ scores werm ~ inclwied and 
the board said --¥ale Basketboll, • so she painted 
the women~ scores on. They then changed the 
sign and the schedules In "Yale men :r and 
women :r basknball. • !left for a year and wlzm I 
returned, the posters hod gone back to before. lfs 
indicative of the AdministraJWn1 aJtilude toward 
women~ athletics. 

Without slam dunks and frequent fights 
on the ice, women's sports may never at-
tract the crowds men's games do. There-
fore, if these events are not as "exciting" 
as men's, no amount of advertisement 
will help promote them. Many here feel, 
however, that only awareness of the 
special qualities of women's athletics will 
trigger appreciation. This year, the Stu-
dent Committee on Athletics (SCA) peti-
tioned the Athletic Department to pr<>-
duce schedule posters for all teams. 
Moreover, all sports, whether wrestling 
or squash, will be gender specified. •1 
know it's repetitive to say Yale men's 
football, but it's frustrating to see men's 
basketball as 'Yale' basketball because 
women's basketball is just as much 'Yale 
basketball,"' Carlson said. 

Athletic Director Frank Ryan feels the 
posters will help ease the strong and con-
stant sense of inequity among many 
women athletes, but also noted a general
