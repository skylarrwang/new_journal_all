"If you were the only white person at 
Yale and you found another white per-
son, I guarantee you'd be very excited 
and you'd want to get together and share 
your experiences," Ayala continued. "A 
lot of the Puerto Ricans here have shared 
the same experiences and understand 
where you're coming from. So you're go-
ing to be around people who support 
you. Jocks hang out together, gays hang 
out together, actors hang out together. 
But we arc conspicuous." 

When people of color sit together in 
Commons, go to their cultural houses or 
speak a language other than English, they 
appear separatist. To many people of col-
or, however, this perception reveals 
deep, widespread misunderstandings 
about their involvement in the Yale com-
munity. Through their organizations and 
informal 
gatherings 
people of color 
believe they are preserving, sharing and 
nurturing a special bond. A more serious 
misunderstanding arises when people 
view racist acts as only harmless pranks. 
Even more subtle and yet more frus-
trating is the 'color blindness' of many 
whites who try not to notice racial dif-
ferences. The need to ignore differences 
implies 'differences' mean 'inequalities,' 
and people of color see 'color blind 
courtesy' as subtle racism that ignores 
their cultural and personal history and 
trivializes thetr oppression. 

"Subtle racism is so tricky, because fre-
quently it comes out of a sincere desire to 
be less racist than those who came before 
you," said Caroline Jackson, '74, director 
of the Afro-Americar Cultural Center 
and one of the first black undergraduate 
women at Yale. "The person who has not 
grown up in an oppressed group fre-
quently winds up tripping all over herself 
trying to demonstrate sincerity which in 
and of itself becomes offensive." 

Karen Porter,JE '86, a first generation 
Jamaican American who attended a 
mostly white high school, thinks Yale 
students avoid racism to an obvious ex-
tent. "You feel like you're working on a 
very superficial level and you're not sure 
how liberal Yale is. It seems you're not 
truly hearing what's going on and getting 
a false picture because people don't com-
municate straightforwardly. Comments 
are covered up in some way to look good, 
not conservative or uninteUigent." 

Subtle racism often betrays itself in the 
way people speak-their tone, word 
choice, the things they choose to talk 
about. Sometimes people introduce a 
person of color as "my Mexican friend" or 
"the black roommate." 

"Some people try to figure out what 
race you are by your eyes, and you think, 
'Why don't you just ask me?'" said Amy 
Yamashiro, ES '87, co-coordinator of the 
Asian American Students' Association 
(AASA). "Sometimes you feel awkward 
because when they fmd out what na-
tionality you are they have to teU you how 
interested they are in it. If they are really 
interested, that's one thing, but when 
they feel like they have to talk about it 
because it's part of your heritage, it 
comes orr as really patronizing." 

Sometimes people of color see scorn in 
someone's eyes. Other times they go ig-
nored in public by a white person who 
talks with them in private, or,just the op-
posite, they are shown off in pubHc as a 
white person's "minority friend." "You 
can teU when someone is sincere," Ayala 
said. "Sometimes you get the feeling peo-
ple are looking at you as if you're a 
subhuman, or people will come up to you 
to talk about something, and you'U feel it 
like an undercurrent, like there are cer-
tain things they're not saying in their 
questions. It's ridiculous! We know we're 
people! We're not asking to be treated 
better than anybody else. We're asking to 
be treated with respect and looked upon 
as human beings." 

I'm sick of filling in your gaps
Sick of being your insurance against
The isolation of your self-imposed limitations
Sick of being the crazy of your holiday dinners
Sick of being the odd one of your Sunday brunches
Sick of being the sole Black friend to 30 individual
white people
Find another ammunition to fight
Fill of your world
Find something else to bring you together
Find some other way to be cool, peaceful and hip

The major cultural houses on cam-
pus- Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano 
de Aztlan (MEChA), Despierta Boricua 
(DB, the Puerto Rican house), AASA 
and 
the 
Afro-Am Center-provide 
essential support for people of color at 
Yale. The houses attract speakers, show 
films and exhibits, put out publications, 
have meals where they prepare foods of 
their cultures and throw parties where 
people generally dance more and drink 
less than at SAC parties. 

"The Afro-Am Center is the only place 
where black students come and don't feel 
in the minority," Jackson said. "A white 
person coming here feels in the minority, 
but imagine Hving your daily life like that. 
After a while maybe you quit noticing it, 
but it doesn't stop hurting, exhausting 
debilitating you. 
The Center 
energizes and resuscitates people. They 
can take leadership roles here and be 
creative. Their cultural experience is 
primary and not secondary and does not 
need to be explained. The Center is 
meant to afftrm ourselves, not to exclude 
white people, but I think that's the only 
way some people can deal with it, sadly 
enough." 

The cultural houses serve as havens of 
warmth and strength for many people of 
color, but women of color must make 
special efforts to cope with a world that 
imposes both racist and sexist stereotypes 
upon them. Yamashiro explained people 
are surprised when an Asian American 
male breaks the stereotype of passivity 
and quietness, but they usually attribute 
his success to his self-assured qualities as 
an American male. "Asian women are 
seen as extremely passive, submissive, non-
descript, following two or three paces 
behind their husbands," Yamashiro said. 
"Most of the Asian American women I 
know consider our identity distinct from 
the Asian woman stereotype, because of 
our level of education, our involvement in 
the women's movement and our drive for 
independence and personal fulfillment. 
Yet when we assert ourselves people 
react even more strongly to us, because 
we are opposing the stereotyped picture." 

Some white men believe the stereo-
types portraying women of color as 
passive, exotic or sensual. Women of col-
or, nonetheless, often remain closet girl-
friends. 

Michelle, 
'86, 
an 
Asian 
woman who preferred not to use her real 
name, recalled her relationship with a 
white student at Yale. "I went out with 
this real jock who thought I was someone 
he could see just every so often. He didn't 
want to show me to his white friends. I 
felt as if I was dating two people. On the 
outside he was real jocky and one of the 
guys and with me he was fine, really 
sweet and considerate. After months of 
dealing with this I felt I had really hurt 
myself. I told him, 'Look, you really have 
a problem because you're white and I'm 
Asian and you can't deal with it. I'm not

here to teach you and I'm not going to 
take you through it.' I told him one day 
he would have to choose which person he 
wanted to be and he said he really felt he 
had to be tough for people to accept 
him.'' 

Black women, who far outnumber 
black men at Yale, find the dating situa-
tion frustrating. Yet if they date white 
men they risk the label "mallomar"- a 
chocolate covered marshmallow, white 
on the inside. Asian women in the same 
situation are sometimes called "twinkies" 
or "bananas." Many women of color must 
come to terms with the "brown paper bag 
syndrome" in which the woman believes 
she is more beautiful if her features are 
European and her skin lighter than a 
brown paper bag. 

Women of color use many different 
strategies to handle race and gender 
issues. When Yamashiro first went to 
AASA it was a predominantly male 
organization. A group of AASA women 
had difficulty finding a means of expres-
sion and left to form their own support 
group. "This year as editor of The Asian 
American Journal at Yale I encourage Asian 
women to express their views in the 
magazine," Yamashiro said, "because a 
lot of Asian men need to be sensitized to 
feminist viewpoints. The Asian American 
Journal is more neutral than Aurora, which 
most men won't touch." 

While Yamashiro works within AASA, 
some women of color have formed sup-
port groups separate from the major, 
cultural organizations. 
The 
Black 
Undergraduate Women's Group, 
created in 1981, serves as a strong sup-
port network for about 15 members. 
Latina Perspectives, active in the '70s, 
has periodically tried to revive itself, but 
some Latina women worry that the 
group will further fragment an already 
small Latin population on campus. 

Of leaving to remind you
To breathe,
Show you suffer,
You your own self,
Your own self suffer,
Your own self,
For all your own suffering,

Although all women face the problem of 
silence, women of color often feel more 
reluctant to speak out because of a con-
spicuousness they sense in social situations 
and predominantly white classrooms. 
Take the example of a Women's Studies 
class which had a section on women of col-
or. Referring to a novel, the professor ask-
ed, "How does this black woman feel?" 
Many people turned to look at the only 
black woman in the room. Of course she 
could not speak for all black women, but 
many women of color feel pressured to act 
as spokespeople for entire races. 

Silence can paralyze a woman of color in 
her daily life. When asked what silence 
meant to her, Ayala replied, "It means be-
ing choked. It means not being heard 
even when you do open your mouth and 
words come out. It means my existence. 
It's what we are, and not always by choice. 
When it is my choice, usually it's a means 
of survival. Sometimes it's giving up and 
saying, 'I'm not going to make a difference 
anyway.' Sometimes it's just trying to stay 
alive with your mind intact." 

Former editor of Aurora, Catherine Liu, 
BK '85, an Asian woman who comes from 
a wealthy, predominantly white suburb, 
tries to fight silence as best she can. 
"There's so much to be done. There is 
racism and sexism on every front- in the 
media, film, literature, everywhere-and 
you can really begin to despair," Liu said. 
"But you have to try to fulfill what is possi-
ble for you. Don't try to shoot the moon, 
because I don't think that's politically effec-
tive. Just affirm what you have and what 
you can do. You may think, 'Okay, my 
friend has made a racist comment. Should 
I say anything or do anything? I mean, 
that won't change the world.' But it's 
available to you! You have a mouth, you 
can talk! This is what you can do and 
you've got to do it." 

Liu has worked actively in the Women's 
Center, unlike many women of color who 
believe women unsympathetic to their 
concerns dominate the Center. "There 
are many women there who don't realize 
a lot of things they do are based on the 
privilege of being white and wealthy," 
Liu said. "It's been incredibly frustrating 
and after a certain point you think, 'Am I 
committed 
to sticking around here 
despite the fact I know there are all these 
things wrong with it?' Then you realize 
you've made a commitment and you're 
going to stick it out. Maybe by just 
being there you've made a statement." 

Women of color can break the silence 
not only in campus organizations, but 
also in classrooms and social situations. 
Unfortunately, all people of color will 
probably have to continue explaining 
themselves 
to the dominant 
white 
culture, but if the white community does 
not listen, then voices fade in silence and 
misunderstandings continue.

I'm glad I must live
Is the bridge broken? Don't you know?
I must leave today
My own friend
Madras,
My own self, taken,
I must leave the bridge to nowhere
But my truth will
Rapidly die
I will leave useful
