**Title: Locals 34 and 35 Thank You**

The members of Local35 and Local34 at Yale deeply appreciate the support 
of the community in our recent struggles. We could not have been successful 
without that support. 

Fair settlements would not have been 
achieved without the concern and hard work of 
so many Yale students, faculty members, 
managerial and professional employees, alumni, 
parents, chaplains, and others in the Yale 
community, and so many in the labor 
movement, community organizations, the clergy 
(especially the Association of New Haven 
Clergy), the women's movement, and many 
members of both the New Haven Board of 
Aldermen and the state legislative delegation 
from the Greater New Haven area. 

literally thousands of people from all walks 
of life, locally and nation-wide, helped in large 
and small ways. We hope that we do not offend 
those thousands if we mention by name, 
because their behind-the-scenes efforts toward a 
settlement have not been publicized, 
Congressman Bruce Morrison and his staff, who 
worked tirelessly to persuade both parties to 
compromise, and Senator Lowell Weicker. 

We believe that our success benefits the 
entire community. Everyone, including the Yale 
administration, is a winner when an important 
part of the community gains new respect. 

In Local 35, the achievement of strong job 
security, and preference for hiring and 
subcontracting at Yale for minorities and 
women, will contribute to the economic 
progress of the people of Greater New Haven. 
Yale, as New Haven's largest employer, has 
historically set a low salary standard for clerical 
and technical employees, and so the significant 
beginning Local 34 has made toward economic 
equality will benefit many in this area, and 
perhaps nationwide. The substantial increases 
for both Unions in pension benefits, and in 
medical protection for retirees, will help end 
Yale's role as a contributor to poverty among 
the elderly in New Haven. 

The whole community is also a winner if 
the Yale Corporation finally sees the need to 
develop a constructive labor relations policy and 
a fair approach to collective bargaining. If that 
turns out to be true, the community can be 
spared the incalculable costs, and the turmoil 
and division, of the 16-year history of labor 
strife at Yale. 

Nationally, our success will provide hope to 
the millions of others resisting the anti-worker 
offensive by managements today, and especially 
to working women and minorities determined 
to end economic discrimination in America. 

We are using this way of thanking all those 
who supported us directly, and all those who 
contributed to ensuring that the strike would 
not resume, because we cannot hope to thank 
each of you individually. 

To all of you: thanks!
