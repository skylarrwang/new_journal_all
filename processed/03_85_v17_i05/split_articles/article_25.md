and absence of women directly affect the 
size, strength, and longevity of any 
women's studies enterprise, anywhere in 
the world." Wenzel is actually the only 
Yale faculty member to have a partial ap-
pointment in Women's Studies. Others 
who teach Women's Studies classes have 
appointments in other departments. 
"This means Women's Studies relies 
upon faculty to whom it can't dictate- it 
relies upon ~ 
will," Chessman said. 
"Ideally," asserted Wilson, "Women's 
Studies should link to the issue of tenur-
ing women." 
The scarcity of tenured women on 
campus reminds feminists involved in 
Women's Studies that 15 years of coeduca-
tion is not a very long time in a place with 
century-old traditions. "This is a conser-
vative University-even though it's coed 
now it bears the traces of its original 
form-a university for men," Chessman 
said. The Women's Studies Program 
resides in a somewhat "precarious posi-
tion," within this University, according to 
Carver. "Women's Studies is trying to 
make a place for itself but somehow it is 
always on the edge. It tries to be a part of 
academia and yet questions traditional 
scholarship. Trying to be in two positions 
at once isn't easy." Wenzel agrees. "I see 
feminism and women's studies in par-
ticular as having to be out of necessity an 
'enclave of outsiders' on the inside, work-
ing constantly toward the transformation 
of that very inside space." 
Virginia Woolf spoke about just that 
"enclave of outsiders" in her 7hree 
Guitws. She might have been talking 
about Yale's Women's Studies Program 
when she described the college that the 
"outsiders"-the women-should found. 
"It is young and poor; let it therefore take 
advantage of those qualities and be 
founded on poverty and youth . . . . Let 
it be built on lines of its own. It must not 
be built of carved stone and stained 
glass
