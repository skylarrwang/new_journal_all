"So dear, how do you like being a woman at Yale?" He was 
kindly and concerned, this member of the Class of Long 
Ago. It would have been neither polite nor politic to ex-
plain how I considered myself a woman and a Yale student, 
but had only a vague idea of the Yale Woman and the in-
trinsic value of being one. A more pertinent question 
would have been, "So dear, do you feel discriminated 
against as a woman here?" 

No, I don't. In some ways I should, but I don't. I am get-
ting the same education as my male classmates. I use the 
same facilities. I speak as frequently in class. I go to the 
same university. I may be an exception, however. 

"I'm a woman who loves men, but to each his own." This 
appeared in pen on a freshly-painted wall in the women's 
room of Cross Campus Library. Someone has circled his. 
An arrow from the word leads to several question marks 
and exclamation points. The only sexual discrimination I 
sense is in such inaccurate figures of speech, which ex-
emplify Problems in Society. 

This may be because I am not an active supporter of 
many of the causes these writers on the wall express. U n-
fortunately, less than half the Yale population ever reads 
their freestyle words, ever looks at this blatantly honest and 
spontaneous demonstration of the issues concerning Yale 
women. 

Fifteen years ago, after more than ten years of debate, 
588 female undergraduates arrived in New Haven. The 
quality of life for women has improved greatly since then, 
from the pretty paint on Vanderbilt bathroom walls to the 
end of the quota for women students, from the founding of 
the Women's Studies Department five years ago to the 
clerical and technical workers' historic unionization. 

But in 1985 I still hear classmates described as "real 
finger-down-the-throat types;" I still hear complaints of 
sexism in the classroom. I have watched the scrawled words 
become increasingly adamant. And I recognize the futility 
of saying sexual discrimination is the world's, not the 
University's problem. 

In this issue of The Ntw journal we bring you the 
bathroom wall. First, the history of how Yale became not a 
brothel, not a week-long mixer, but a better center of learn-
ing after the advent of women. Next, three female 
graduates from these early years describe their experiences 
at the cutting edge of coeducation, often sensing disaffec-
tion similar to what women of color continue to feel today. 
As more women arrived, feminism gained a voice on cam-
pus through Aurora and the Women's Center, and im-
provements occurred slowly in the area of academics, 
although the need remains for significant improvement in 
the number of tenured women professors. Women have 
brought other unique concerns to Yale, including eating 
disorders, which affect a majority of female students here. 
Deficiencies in the women's sports program also merit the 
University's increased attention. On the lighter side, we 
bring you cartoonist Sandra Boynton, one of Yale's most il-
lustrious illustrators. 

For four years, we have no other world than Yale. It's a 
malleable place when one considers the relative speed of its 
evolution from a bastion of masculinity. In several years we 
may realize how few other institutions can move so quickly. 
The coeducation of Yale is not yet complete. Although 
we can blame the slow pace of societal advancements, that 
fact remains. If change is to take place. let it be here.
