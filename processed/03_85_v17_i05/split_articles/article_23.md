**Seeking A New Tradition**
**Author: Melissa Turner**
**Page number(s): 41**

In the academic treatment of art, women 
cannot easily create their own traditions 
and 
follow 
new 
philosophies. 
Men 
exclusively have defined art is tic 
standards. The question then arises; with 
What artistic standards should the work 
and opinions of women artists be 
'analyzed? 
"I was always encoura~d to look at past 
an, but none of the artists inspired me. 
;rhey were all male. It has always 
bothered me that women artists have 
been overlooked. It bothers my art. It's 
hard to be inspired by a tradition that 
doesn't speak to you," said Dominique 
Dibbell, DC '86, a discouraged art m~jor 
who has taken the semester off to rethink 
her plans. 
She feels 
women artists do not 
necessarily subscribe to traditional views 
Of art. For instance, female and male 
painters approach painting the female 
nude in entirelv different wavs. \\!omen 
painters do oot depict the' archetypal 
female 
as their male counterparts 
might-but the latter's portrayal sets and 
follows tradition. 
Both Dibbell and Karen, '86, an artist 
who preferred 
not 
to be named, 
expressed 
frustration 
with 
the Art 
Department's painting program and its 
llack of focus on women in art history. Art 
fhistory books seldom acknowledge 
women artists, and frustration increases 
(because professors here very rarely 
'address that conspicuous absence. Stu· 
Clents are not referred to the work of 
women artists. "It would be impossible to 
talk to a teacher about how women's 
unagery might differ from men's or the 
difference a woman's consciousneo;c; might 
make. Most professors would be skeptical 
of making any such distinction," Karen 
said. Dibbell remembered when History 
Of Art Professor Robert Herbert took the 
time to research works of women artists in 
hia course "An in the Machine Age." 
re Dibbc.-11 gained inspiration from 
the work of an artist, a woman artist. 
These women assert the technical 
Philosophy of Yale's painting program is 
traditional and sometimes stifling. 
onnalism, the traditional approach, 
emphasizes the "grammatical" struc:ture 
Ol a painting over its subjecti,·e content, 
aid Roger Tibbets, director of 
undergraduate studies in the Art 
Department. Formalism stresses 
expn•ssion through the relationship of 
spc:cific colors and shapes rather than an 
explicit 
illustrative approach. "The 
overriding formalism here can be a bias 
against women artists who are conscious 
of themselves as such. If you're a woman 
artist in this time you have to be aware of 
yourself as a woman. You're deceiving 
yourself if you're not," Karen said. 
"Formalism stifles those who are feminillts 
and want to say something in their art 
because it concentrates so much on form 
that the content in the end is different 
from what one could get if the message 
were presented explicitly. The teachers 
would rather not discuss the content of 
the: work if it's political." 
However, according to Tibbets, 
formalism is not insensitive to con-
content, but creates the basis for its 
prest•ntation. He also does not view the 
art produced by '"umen as inherently 
different from that of men. But Karen 
objects to this belief. "There's not much 
spa(e to create S('lf-conscious women's art, 
but there's not much initiative on the 
students' part either," she said. "The issue 
doesn't arise because there is no reference 
to the• fact that you are a woman." 
Subtle 
bias~s imposed by an 
O\ crwhelmingly male 
faculty are 
im rnt'diately obvious but difficult to 
overcome ... The teachers can empathize 
with their male students better because in 
them they see themselves when they were 
student<:," Karen said. Some professors 
hold to traditional gender expectations 
and may expreo;s them in sexist language 
in lectures. 
One othetv. ise ambitious and en-
thusiastic sophomore architecture ma-
jor's dissatisfaction with the program 
stems from the language she hears in 
the: majority of her architecture classes. 
In them professors refer to .. man" as the 
"molder of space, the designer of space." 
wV\'ords conjure up images and the im-
ages are of something 111 never be: a 
man," she said. "As a woman. it is very 
hard to imagine myself in the position 
of 'man the dominator of space.' I feel 
out.,ide the image created for me."
