Seeing with New Eyes 
Pam Thompson 
"There are huge 
silences, great 
yawning gaps in our 
knowledge of women's 
place in history." 
36 The New joumal/March I, 1985 
Tucked in the corner of a parking lot between College and Temple 
Streets stands a small yellow building. Across its walls an unknown graf-
fiti artist has scrawled "there is no justice, just us" in red spray paint. 
Despite its 
nondescript appearance this little building has a 
name-Corbey Court-and a functi6n. It houses Yale's Affirmative Ac-
tion Office and the Women's Studies Program. 

For most Yale students, women's studies is as peripheral academically 
as its office is architecturally. Many probably have not reached the back 
of the Blue Book to examine the department's listings. Many more have 
never thought of women's studies as a discipline and, if pressed, reveal 
they do not really understand its purpose. But for those professors and 
students involved in women's studies it is not at all peripheral, it is of cen-
tral importance. Liz Carver, SM '85, a Women's Studies major, suggests 
it means "reorganizing the entire way you look at the world." According 
to Helene Wenzel, director of undergraduate studies (DUS) of the pro-
gram, she and others have viewed 
women's studies as "an 
epistemological revolution within the hallowed halls of higher education." 

The history of the development of women's studies at Yale is not, 
however, one of sudden revolutionary change, but of gradual academic 
institutionalization. "When women arrived at Yale, feminism and 
women's studies were beginning to be very visible political and academic 
concerns," said Margaret Homans, acting chair of the program. During 
the first five years of coeducation, departments responded to the 
pressures of student demand and current scholarship by offering scat-
tered courses focusing on women. At the time, half of the fewer than 10 
courses directly involving women's concerns were offered through the 
Residential College Seminar program. In 1977, Yale College sponsored 
its first interdisciplinary, introductory course in women's studies. During 
the following summer term, the College offered 10 courses as an experi-
mental Women's Studies Program. That year the Yale College Commit-
tee on the Education of Women (successor to the original University 
Committee on Coeducation) proposed the permanent establishment of 
the program .md the faculty approved it in May 1979. With the pro-
gram's inception the number of courses focusing on women in other 
departments almost doubled. 

According to the program's grant proposal, the founders of Women's 
Studies at Yale conceived it to be a response to the intellectual needs for 
both more information about women's lives and contributions and the 
revision of existing theories which make sense only of men's experience. 
Five years after the program's establishment these basic needs are still 
evident.
