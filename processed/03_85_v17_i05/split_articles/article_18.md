University for a "women's space," which 
was fmally created in the basement of 
Hendrie Hall. The Women's Center 
moved to its present location on Elm 
Street only five years ago, the same year 
Aurora ftrst appeared as an independent 
publication. 

When Cope reflected upon her earlier 
reluctance 
to become 
involved 
in 
women's issuesL she concluded her change 
pf heart came from encountering intellec-
tual and social obstacles at Yale she had 
never run into before. Like many Yale 
women, Cope said, "I used to be a 
feminist without labeling myself that 
way, because I had feminist expectations 
about what was possible for me to do in 
the world. Now, my feminism has to do 
with a certain attitude, a coming to terms 
with my right to be angry, my right to 
fight for what I expect." She has talked to 
many alumnae who had nothing to do 
with the Women's Center when they 
were here. "When they left Yale, tried to 
get jobs, tried to get paid, tried to buy 
cars, tried to get credit, but couldn't 
because they weren't married, they 
changed their 
m inds and 
called 
themselves feminists." 

Cope is often asked what the purpose 
of the Women's Center is and has no 
trouble 
simply 
stating, "Yale 
gives 
women a superficial and sometimes false 
sense of equality, but women have the 
same 
problems here they do 
anywhere else. Women at Yale are 
beaten, sexually harassed and raped. 
Someone has to make the University deal 
with these problems. If there wasn't an 
advocate for women's issues on campus, 
a lot of those questions would be allowed 
to disappear." She also described some 
more subtle reasons why women at Yale 
might need a space dedicated solely to 
their needs. "There are whole systems of 
protection set up for men here where 
women don't neces~arily have a place, in-
stitutions here that women cannot be a 
part of. Actually, we have a joke that 
goes, 'the University 
is the 
men's 
center."' 

Bernice Hausman, TC '84, now co-
coordinator of the Women's Political 
Caucus, had a different kind of first en-
counter with the Women's Center.

Hausman became involved in Women's 
Center projects her freshman year 
because she was impressed with the 
discussions she heard there. "I had never 
before come into contact with people talk-
ing so honestly about sexual, personal 
and political issues." Hausman ran the 
ERA task force for the Women's Political 
Caucus her sophomore year but remain-
ed dissatisfied with the atmosphere she 
found at Yale. She took the next year ofT, 
"mainly to get a sense of myself as a 
woman outside of a male place like Yale." 
Hausman had been frustrated with the 
absence or paucity of women in some of 
her courses and disappointed with the 
classes she took that did deal specifically 
with women. "There are some very 
superficial ways of discussing women's 
issues, ways that overlook some of the 
real problems. Sometimes everyone's so 
willing to agree, real discussion peters 
out." 

Hausman remembers one class in par-
ticular where she observed "bad feelings 
between the white women in the class 
and the women of color, feelings that 
were never expressed until the last day of 
class." 

Hausman 
thinks 
her 
misunderstandings about the problem of 
race in the women's movement confused 
her own defmition of feminism. She now 
believes, "It's easy for white women to 
say we should all organize together, 
because we want everyone in our group, 
and it's hard for us to see that a lot of the 
concerns are very different for women of 
different backgrounds and racial iden-
tities." 

. Since the beginning of the women's 
movement, the issue of race has initiated 
much controversy. Brownrigg noted, "In 
the early days, women's rights activists 
believed we had to present a united front 
to get anything done. Now I think we've 
come to the point where we can afford to 
question ourselves on that issue, and this 
has recently become a very important 
concern for feminists at Yale." Hausman 
recognizes that the Women's Political 
Caucus consists predominantly of white 
women, but she believes, "The thing to 
do is to form coalitions around certain 
issues we can work on together, while 
recognizing that our existence and status 
at Yale are very different. One has to 
respect that difference, understand that 
difference and state that difference con-
stantly in order to remain aware of it." 

This awareness of difference, not a 
consciousness of ideological or personal 
similarity, is ironically the most obvious 
link between different kinds of feminist 
beliefs and politics at Yale. Thus Nadia 
Tchao believes feminism is destined to 
become a "sometimes uncomfortable 
plurality." Bernice Hausman believes 
feminism will have to learn to provide 
"more guidance, more understanding of 
what it means to be a woman at Yale. 
There aren't any models out there, and 
there are never going to be any that 
everyone can use," and Karin Cope 
speaks about helping women to fulfill 
feminist expectations. At Yale, women's 
organizations have been haunted by 
stereotypes and condemnatory labels, 
and yet the women who write for 
feminist publications and who give their 
time to women's political and social issues 
share no unifying principle, not even a 
simple definition of the word "feminism." 

But even if feminist politics now holds 
itself responsible for an enormous range 
of issues, from sexual harassment to 
racial discrimination, Liz Schindler still 
believes, "There's something we can do 
besides sinking into despair after we 
realize how remote are other people's ex-
periences from our own." Along these 
lines, Sylvia Brownrigg concluded, "I 
don't know how much of what goes on in 
the Women's Center has an outside ef-
fect or changes people's opinions, but by 
being visible we show the rest of the Yale 
community that problems exist, and peo-
ple exist who are very willing to devote 
time and effort towards eradicating 
them."
