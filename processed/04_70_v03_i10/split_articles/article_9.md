Traditions, as I mentioned, are strong 
here; so is general respect for the law. 
While the judgments of the law may 
sometimes be questioned, the law itself 
is a majestic lady. She bears no resem· 
blance to that tarnished creature, her 
American cousin; neither has she had to 
withstand the same sort of attacks. 

What still exists here, where the ques-
• tions of conscience and law have not been 
so starkly raised, is what Hawthorne 
called "the general sentiment which 
gives law its vitality." Right and wrong 
are somehow less complicated; a police-
man's quiet: "Here, we can't have that," 
carries more force than the pistol com-
ing out of a cop's holster in New York .... 

Of Cambridge's 29 colleges, Churchill 
is the newest ( 1961 ); and therefore 
somewhat less dogmatic and formal in 
tone. (There are still colleges in the 
University which exlude women from 
High Table.) Nevertheless, dining at 
Churchill is a pretty formal affair: one 
marches into the high, mahogany pan-
elled Hall on the arm of one's host - my 
own husband can only bring me four 
times during the year; I must go as 
someone else's guest, and when I am

asked, my husband is expected not to 
be present - part of a long black-robed 
r procession. Meanwhile, the several hun-
dred students present, all of them also in 
rustling black robes, have risen: we 
file past the rows of uplifted faces (and 
sotto voce comments), then stand behind 
our seats at the white, sparkling High 
Table. 

A great hush settles over the Hall: 
everyone looks toward the Master. 
''Benedictus, Benedictatum," he pro-
claims without enthusiasm. 

And with the Lord's blessing, we sit 
down to eat.

Herbert Scarf who is teaching at Cam-
bridge this year.
