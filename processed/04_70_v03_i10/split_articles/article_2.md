which might hurt its competitiveness. 
For example, it took student directors 
a month and a half and a decision of the 
Executive Committee to gain access to 
the salary ranges (but not the exact 
salary) of the executive staff, although 
this information could probably be 
gained through a phone call or visit to 
the Secretary of State. 

Once, plans having come to my at-
tention that detailed a major expansion 
for the book department, I asked Mr. 
Willoughby to elaborate on them. He 
looked surprised and said he had no 
knowledge of any such plans. But with-
in a short time a dossier including the 
plans and considerations that made their 
implementation impossible was presented 
to the Student Board. Nor is this the only 
time Mr. Willoughby has found it con-
venient to deny facts to the Student 
Board. 

Beyond this, there has been no great 
impulse by the board of directors itself 
to inform the Co-op's membership about 
operations or significant structural 
changes. 

Mr. Willoughby's self view is mis-
sionary. His management does only good. 
In reading his answers to suggestions and 
complaints that the Co-op has recently 
begun posting (after months of prodding 
by the student directors) you feel the 
Co-op is incapable of mistakes because 
Mr. Willoughby can explain them all into 
oblivion. He is closed to criticism and 
anathematizes any conflicting viewpoint. 

Once he went to the trouble of Xeroxing 
a newsletter which suggested that the 
Co-op's book department was in bad 
shape and which supported my petition 
for structural changes. He sent it to all 
the student directors with a cover note 
that charged it was "a reflection on the 
intelligence and integrity of the Board of 
Directors." 

He abhors publicity. At my second 
meeting with him he told me, "Well, I 
hope you're not going to talk with the 
newspapers .... You know how they can 
distort things and cause trouble." 

In the Fall of 1965 the News dis-
covered that the Co-op was using rather 
extreme tactics in getting Yale students 
to sign confessions after they had been 
apprehended as suspected shoplifters. 
According to the News reporter who 
discovered the practice, suspected stu-
dents "were taken to the Co-op basement 
and were told that the Executive Com-
mittee was already acting in their case ... 
that they had better sign." The News 
was amazed and chagrinned and went to 
Willoughby. The outcome, as some 
former Newsmen have reported, is that 
the News agreed to kill any story and the 
Co-op to kill the practice. But publicity, 
which can make things so distorted, was 
avoided. 

The news released is often more ar-
cane than informative. Any student dur-
ing his tenure can count on being sup-
plied with reprints of clippings on shop-
lifting. A large share of the very few ref-
erences to the Co-op in the News refer 
to shoplifting. I 965-66 was typical. 
'"The figure is startling,' said Mr. Wil-
loughby, 'but he would give no statistics·· 
(September 21, 1965). Again, "Although 
refusing to give figures, he did indicate 
that there was a noticeable rise in theft 
this year" (March 11, 1966). 

The basic problem with Mr. Willough-
by's zeal is that it is tainted by his views 
of students and of the store's goals. He 
has an unfortunate tendency to stereo-
type any student who wants reform as a 
radical; then he proceeds to ignore the 
substance of what they want. His Yale 
man tends to wear Gant shirts jlnd Deans-
gate suits, snack on Poppycock, and ask 
Santa Claus for Head skis. His coeds, on 
the other hand, are John-Meyer-of-Nor-
walk girls who drool over Dansk pretties. 
This view, which is shared by most alum-
ni and faculty directors, is reinforced by 
his contacts with students, for the stu-
dent directors have traditionally been 
jocks or other BMOC's. Willoughby is a 
trustee at Saint Anthony Hall and eats at 
Mory's. These patterns help fum his mind 
about the average Yale man. It's no won-
der Mr. Willoughby thinks the Co-op 
serves the university community. 

In addition to his propensity to see 
every student as a single type, his con-
cept of what the Co-op should be like is 
further afflicted by a rather disturbingly 
unclear notion of who shops there. In 
a December meeting of the Student 
Board Mr. Willougl1by expressed his 
conviction that students spent less 
at the Co-op than faculty and alumni 
members and that graduate and pro-
fessional students spent less than under-
graduates - both misconceptions. 

As with his rather limited definition 
of the community he serves, Mr. Wil-
loughby's maneuverability is limited by 
his insistence that the Co-op is to 
be treated as any other business. 

Consequently, he wants it to be suc-
cessful, which gives rise to his constant 
concern over profitability, a concern 
that causes him to lose sight of the 
Co-op's role as a community service 
- as a real cooperative. The result is 
that many departments exist in the 
Co-op because they allegedly return 
high profits. But these departments 
cramp and confine others, like the 
book department, which are less prof-
itable, but more important to a 
university community. 

To Willoughby the mark of business 
success is the maintenance of the 
patronage refund at a high level. But 
in order to maintain it profits must be 
high and, understandably, prices must 
be high. Mr. Willoughby's counter is 
that the Co-op vigilantly insures 
"competitive prices." But it is inter-
esting to note that the basis of compar-
ison is "Macy's and other department 
stores,'' to quote Willoughby. Yet 
other competitors, such as discount 
stores, exist. In only one Co-op de-
partment, the Health and Beauty aids 
section, has the basis of comparison 
(recently) been shifted from Macy's 
to cut-rate drug stores. But the rest of 
the departments retain the list prices 
which simply aren't the lowest possible. 

The more nefarious method of main-
taining a high PR is by confiscating 
refunds due to late-paying customers. 
This boosts the PR rate by two and one 
half per cent. In addition a credit charge 
is added after a bill becomes thirty 
days late. In contrast, at the Harvard 
Co-op, no member loses his patrona~e 
refund. He simply pays the credit 
charge on overdue bilJs. 

But Mr. Willoughby's attitude is 
that high PR shall prevail. Thus here-
fuses to consider reasonable alterna-
tives such as cutting prices to give 
immediate discounts while retaining 
some profits for captial needs. 

But how is Mr. Willoughby able to 
maintain such tight control? Don't 
the student directors do anything? 
Traditionally the students, whose 
gleaming proftles grace the Co-op's 
walls, have been a "pretty dead group" 
according to one director. The reason 
is not that the student directors don't 
want to be active, at least initially, but

that the thrust of their socialization 
is toward complacency. The under-
graduate directors are elected during 
their freshman year and serve until they 
graduate. Since they are given little to 
do, their interest and their activism 
quickly wither. In addition, they carry 
the burden of youth, a burden which has 
nothing to do with their ability to 
function effectively or productively 
but instead affects their perception of 
that ability. The common belief presses-
on them that the adult directors must 
be more able and more knowledgeable 
because they are adults. Most adult 
directors simply do not think of 
them as decision-makers in the organi-
zation. The cognition that nothing 
is expected of them, together with 
the lack of anything significant to do, 
and the impulse to yield to ttie authority 
of age, make the student directors a 
generally lifeless body. 

In addition, Mr. Willoughby tightly 
controls the monthly meetings. He 
establishes the agenda, invites the 
guests, and presides. Typically, after 
the minutes are read, a financial report 
will be given by a member of the 
staff. Next there are reports from the 
book and advertising departments, an 
operations report and student inquir-
ies. Most student inquiries concern 
fuewood and deodorants; those that 
involve more substantial issues almost 
always are explained away by Mr. 
Willoughby with a statement of "Co-
op Policy." The directors offer some 
questions, often minor. Once, twenty-
five minutes was given over to a dis-
cussion of whether or not the Co-op 
should stock Marvel comic books. 

The function of the agenda and of 
member inquiries is to create the illusion 
of having accomplished something as 
weU a~ to fill up time. 

This year, however, the Student 
Board has begun to assert a good deal 
of independence and initiative. The 
meetings have broken away from Mr. 
Willoughby's control, and significant 
issues are being discussed without his 
approval. This has prompted several 
students to comment, ''At least the 
meetings are not dull anymore." 

But whether the Board will continue 
in this unusual vein, and in opposition 
to the Executive Committee and Mr. 
Willoughby on some issues, is problem-
atical (given the "advisory" role 
that Mr. Willoughby and the Executive 
Committee has assigned them). 

The point where the Co-op breaks down 
beyond belief is in the book depart-
ment. It is not efficient in getting 
texts {though this, of course, is most 
often a professor's or publisher's 
fault) or in keeping current a good 
supply of books needed for scholarly 
endeavor {though if you want to go into 
gardening or Agatha Christie, the 
Co-op can help you there). Graduate 
students strongly registered their 
dissatisfaction in the recent Co-op 
questionnaire. A history professor spent 
fifteen minutes of class time recently 
agonizing over his difficulties in getting 
a book he needed. "But at Harvard," he 
ended, "at Harvard they have all those 
wonderful books, anything you could 
want." 

The Co-op's Book Committee, assist-
ed by faculty consultants and, since 
February, graduate consultants, is 
supposed to make sure that the book de-
partment is functioning weU. The 
faculty consultant program was estab-
lished in 1961 as an attempt to keep the 
basic stock list up to date. There have 
been and are several professors who give 
generously of their time, but more whose 
contributions are minimal. 

At the fust meeting of the Book Com-
mittee last November, one professor in 
the social sciences expressed his view 
of his role: he selected good, scholarly 
works that he and his colleagues thought 
valuable and he specifically excluded 
popularized works and scholarly efforts 
in areas that did not interest him. An-
other professor, again in the social sci-
ences, thought that "graduate students 
do not buy books" and that the Co-op 
should merely provide books of interest 
to the faculty. Another phenomenon of 
the faculty consultants is an almost 
proprietary concern expressed by a few 
for the shelves in "their" departments. 

The program, after nine years, hasn't 
been successful. The book department 
manager, Mr. G. Roysce Smith, and I 
talked about the problem, and I agreed 
to recruit graduate students to supple-
ment the faculty consultants. in the de-
partments which had them, and to serve 
their function in those departments which 
did not. On starting to contact the 
various Graduate Senate members and 
departmental clubs, I found that in 
several departments such as political 
science, economics, and Spanish, stu-
dents and student groups were very con-
cerned about the books in their re-
spective fields and were about to send 
representatives to the Co-op to do some-
thing about it. 

Thus, while initially hesitant about 
the prospects of recruiting graduate stu-
dents to work for the two dollars an 
hour that Mr. Willoughby was willing to 
pay I found that many students would 
have been willing to take on the respon-
sibility of reviewing the Co-op's book 
selection voluntarily. 

Different consultants give various ac-
counts of what they were asked to do. 
But it is clear from even Mr. Smith's 
description of their role that in addition 
to updating the neglected stock lists in 
their areas, they were at least initially 
supposed to perform the duties of 
stock clerks. In essence, the recruitment 
of graduate consultants was as much an 
attempt to recruit more labor as an at-
tempt to improve the Co-op's book 
selection. 

But even if the graduates are as success-
ful as they can be, many other problems 
must be solved before the book depart-
ment can operate as it should. Ultimate-
ly, the Co-op must find some way besides 
cheap, casual labor on the part of grad-
uate students to maintain a fust-rate 
book store. 

There is definitely a personnel prob-
lem. The department, which has a high 
turn-over rate, must accept a great deal 
of blame for the failure to revise basic 
stock lists in the past, to recruit and 
adequately train personnel, or to seek 
out specialists who would make sure 
that the Co-op's book selection was 
adequate. 

There are administrative problems, 
aggravated this year by a large increase 
in course changes and a greater popular-
ity of paperbacks. One of the results is 
an often unnecessary delay in reorder-
ing books - clerks have in the past 
waited for weeks to send in an order. 

But the basic problem is one of 
space. Unless more space is allocated to 
the book department, every other effort 
to make it adequate is bound to fail . 
There is simply not enough room for 
books, and if the graduate consultants 
order many new titles the problem can 
only increase. Already one consultant 
reports that "most of the books that 
have come in for one section have al-
ready been sold off the bench in the 
aisle." Others describe personnel as 
hesitant to order new titles until the 
space problem has been solved. (Only 
one consultant has said he has adequate 
space to revise the stock list for his de-
partment.) 

But the tight, cramped, poorly ar-
ranged shelves, the tiny storage area and 
the limited selections are going to re-
main until Mr. Willoughby giyes up his 
position that the Co-op must continue 
to stock Nine Aags cologne and Mont 
Blanc fountain pens as well as the Loeb 
Classical Library. While Mr. Willough-
by feels such things are a necessary serv-
ice to the Co-op's clientele, the fact is 
that they're available all over New Haven 
and don't require a trip to New York, 
as finding a desired book often does. And 
the university store, it seems, should try 
harder to provide books than cologne 
and posh fountain pens. 

In talking with Mr. Willoughby last 
November every suggestion I had about 
the present selection of goods was 
countered by the objection that the 
Co-op's current merchandise selection was 
necessary to serve the entire community; 
and that it would be uneconomical to 
increase the book department. I asked 
for data on the costs in various depart-
ments and was referred to the annual 
. report. Then, I asked for a breakdown 
of costs and profits per department, 
which is not available in the reports. 
Jdr. Willoughby asked what I was 
specifically interested in, and I told 
him then, and on several other occasions, 
that I was interested in seeing how 
feasible it would be to replace some of 
the staid and non-student oriented goods 
with books. I still have not received 
such data. Who runs the Co-op and the 
way in which they run it is of great 
significance to many at Yale. The issue is 
whether the present structure and organ· 
ization can lead to a representative 
governance and responsive management. 

Considering the present situation 
the following steps seem advisable: 
1.) Students and other directors should 
become involved as planners in all de-
cision-making at the Co-op. It is essential 
that the management and the rest of the 
Board take the students and the job of 
director seriously. 
2.) Directors should be elected yearly by 
ballot, provision should be made for 
membership referendum on important 
issues, and the Co-op should hold an 
annual meeting of members. 
3.) Meetings should be announced, 
and agendas and accounts of actions taken 
should be made available, the press 
should be invited to meetings. 
4.) The general manager should no longer 
preside at Board meetings. Above all, 
the existing ethic that keeps organization-
al loyalty paramount must be replac.e.d 
with an orientation towards serving and 
representing members. The structure of 
the Board should not isolate students 
or other directors. 
5.) The Co-op should bring in outside 
consultants to evaluate all aspects of its 
management and policy. The recent 
questionnaire is a beginning, at least 
in assessing wants. A restructuring of 
operations can only be based upon valid 
information about present operations 
and member preferences. 

The reconsideration of existing 
policy should acknowledge the obvious, 
something the present management has 
not been able to do. As Milton Brown, 
President of the Harvard Co-op, said 
during last year's restructuring of that 
institution, "Students are just not buy-
ing suits and hats anymore."
