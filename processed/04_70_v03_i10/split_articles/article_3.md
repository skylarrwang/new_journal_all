No superlative need apply

Megon biblion megon kakon: "A big 
book is a big bag" is a pretty good rule 
of thumb. Like all rules, however, it is 
susceptible to exceptions, one of the 
most notable being the Grossman edition 
of the Divine Comedy. Dante has found 
in Bergin and Baskin what Shakespeare 
did in Verdi and Boito. The presentation 
is a masterpiece. 

To review the Divine Comedy would 
at this point be rather superfluous. It 
seems to have stood the test of years 
pretty well; its medieval impostation 
notwithstanding, it has a continuingly 
incisive universality. 

Whatever else it is, the Divine Comedy 
is a personal experience: the present 
edition is one as well. It is obviously 
the fruition of a labor of love, and, 
like all such endeavors, must be viewed 
in its entirety. The translation and the 
illustrations are as integral a part of 
each other as can be imagined in a col-
laboration. One is reminded by juxta-
position of Fellini Satyricon, which, 
like the Bergin-Baskin Dante, is the re-
flection of the individual perception of 
a classic. 

This edition is the culmination of 
a life-long study of Dante by Mr. Bergin. 
Finis coronat opus. There are, of course, 
those who would quibble with the ren-
dering of certain lines, as, for example, the 
inscription over the gates of Hell: 
Through me ye enter in the town of woe, 
Through me ye pass into eternal sorrow, 
Through me ye join the nation of the lost. 
Justice my lofty architect did move 
To my creation. Mighty Power Divine 
Supremest Wisdom, and Primeval Love 
Established me. Before me there were 
none 
Save timeless things, and timeless I shall 
stand; 
Bid hope farewell, aU ye who enter here. 

These are certainly the most famous 
lines in the poem, and most people are 
accustomed to Longfellow's rendition 
of the verb in the last verse as "abandon., 
But "bid farewell" is in fact more in 
keeping with the original "lasciate." 

This may seem to be a trifling point, 
but it illustrates the basic quality of 
the translation, for which the word could 
be no-nonsense. The choice of blank 
verse as the medium is an optimal mid-
dle way: it avoids the artificiality in-
herent in attempting to reproduce terza 
rima in English, while preserving a 
poetic quality and discipline lacking in 
the prose and free verse translations. 

The other feature of the edition is 
that it does not make waves. Indicative 
is the note to Inferno I, 29 as "baffling." 
Mr. Bergin makes no attempt to solve 
the major riddles of the work, like who 
is the "veltro tra feltro e feltro. " He 
is content to present the enigmas clearly 
but as they are: he bears the view of the 
dispassionate scholar rather than that of 
the zealot. Where the original is hermetic, 
so is the translation. Conclusions are left 
to the reader, rather than being solved 
by the translator as deus cum aut sine 
mach ina. 

In considering the translation as a 
whole one can look in vain for the spec-
tacular passages, but Mr. Bergin's crafts-
manship is on another, higher level. He 
is, as it were, the Ciardi of translation. 
Nowhere is this better illustrated than in 
his version of Vergil's parting words to 
Dante the pilgrim. 
The temporal and the eternal ftre 
you've seen, my son, and have come to a 
place 
where I can see no further by myself. 
With art and reason I have brought you 
here; 
hence forward take your pleasure as 
your guide. 
Out of the steep and narrow ways you've 
won; 
see there the sun that shines upon your 
brow, 
mark the fresh grass, the flowers and the 
shrubs 
which here the soil produces of itself, 
So sit or go amongst them as you will 
until in happiness the fair eyes come 
you with their weeping dispatched me 
to you; 
await no more my gesture or my word; 
your will is free and upright, full of 
health; 
it would be wrong to act not as it bids; 
mitre and crown I give you o'er yourself. 

Complement to the text are the illustra-
tions of Leonard Baskin, extraorrJinary 
through their sheer strength. These are 
no maudlin or mawkish sentimentalities. 
They function through the edition much 
as the Leitmotif in a Wagnerian opera. 
This is particularly evident in the recur-
ring illustrations of Dante's animal 
imagery - the leopard, the she-wolf, 
the eagle. Here more than anywhere else 
is one reminded of the Fellini Satyricon. 
The material selected for illustration is 
the nexus of each canto, although not 
necessarily the most pictorial of the 
poem's offerings. They are stark. This 
is not, however, a fault, but an almost 
tactile reproduction of the Dantesque 
Weltanschauung. Inferno is peopled 
with fabulous beasts, monsters, and de-
praved souls whose humanity is under-
lined by the very portrayal of their des-
perateness. Purgatory is similarly illus-
trated but with that implied time of 
hope inherent in the Commedia. The 
emphasis in the Paradiso is on the verbal 
imagery: these are no Sunday School 
textbook pictures but the medieval 
company of the blessed in a modern 
context. The illustrations provide 
dramatic and visual proof that indeed 
the work is, as Shelley put it, a bridge 
between the ages. 

Some years ago, when studying the 
Divine Comedy with Mr. Bergin, one was 
struck with the frequency of the com-
ment .. Che bello" as a critical remark. 
Its simplicity is telling. What else, in 
fact, is one going to say? One could ex-
patiate in the beauty of the format, on 
the quality of the book, on the readability 
of the translation, on the strength of 
the illustrations, on the sheer weigltt of 
the three volumes. 

One could discuss the synechdochial 
relevance of Dante to modem times. 
One could compare editions from Bot-
ticelli and Boccaccio to Ciardi and Dore. 
But when all is said and done, no com-
ment more fitting could be made than 
"Che bello." No superlative is needed 
because the edition is in itself a super-
lative . â€¢
