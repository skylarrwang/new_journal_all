Dick Corey, a second year graduate stu-
dent, was concerned about the Co-op 
much before he was chosen by the 
Graduate Senate to represent them on 
the Co-op's Board of Directors. From 
his year of experience, often frustrating, 
occasionally hopeful, he has culled 
these details in an attempt to explain 
the Co-op, its organization, and why it is 
what it is. Though extremely reluctant 
to write this article he felt it to be one 
of the few ways to gain notice for the 
suggestions he has to make for a better 
Co-op. 


It's hard to imagine anyone getting 
worked up over the price of deodorants 
at Malley's or the unavailability of some 
book at Whitlock's. But at the Co-op 
when you are made to wait two months 
to get some needed book, you feel a 
right to get angry. The Co-op is, well, a 
co-operative. 


But it isn't. In a 1965 revision of its 
articles of incorporation, passed by the 
Connecticut legislature without any hoop-
la, the Co-op became a non-stock cor-
poration, wholly controlled by its twenty-
five directors. The articles were changed 
specifically to exclude membership voting 
rights, and a revision of the by-laws made 
in the same year states that "members 
shall not be entitled to vote on any mat-
ter and this corporation shall be operated 
under the management of its board of di-
rectors which shall be self-perpetuating." 


The rather hushed action was designed 
to make impossible any charge that the 
Board of Directors had been acting il-
legally in naming new directors. For if 
members had a right to vote for directors 
(as there is reason to believe they had 
prior to 1965) then many previous Boards 
may have been elected illegally. The 
Board may also have acted illegally by 
failing to have a quorum at various times. 
Some nifty work in Hartford, however, 
has spared subsequent Boards of any 
nagging suspicion that things aren't 
being done quite right. It also nicely 
eliminates the possibility that a group of 
activated students could directly influence 
Co-op policy. The Board rests assured. 


The present Board is composed of 
eight faculty directors, eight students, 
eight alumni, and Charles L Willoughby, 
President and General Manager. The 
faculty (of eight, seven are or recently 
have been Yale administrators) and the 
alumni are selected by the Nominating 
Committee, in which Mr. Willoughby 
takes an active part though he is not 
technically a member. This group searches 
for congenial replacements for retiring 
members, with very few suggestions 
sought from the alumni and faculty to 
be represented. The six undergraduate 
directors are elected at the end of their 
freshman year by their class. They serve 
three years. The Law School has in the 
past chosen a director and the Graduate 
Senate chose one this year. 


The selection of at least graduate and 
professional student directors will un-
doubtedly be modified later this year. 
The Executive Committee recently re-
commended a change, to be ratified by 
the full Board, in the proportion and 
number of student directors. The pro-
posal would increase the number of stu-
dent directors to twelve and would in-
clude the principle of parity between the 
undergraduate and the graduate and pro-
fessional students. 


But in practice, the real power and in-
fluence in the store is centered in the 
Executive Committee. It is responsible 
for determining the patronage refund, 
fixing salaries, and operating the store 
between meetings of the full Board. It 
presently consists of eleven members, in-
cluding Mr. Willoughby and the two cus-
tomary seniors. As all Co-op meetings 
include dining at Mory's afterwards, the 
Executive Committee has pleasant times 
and common experience to bind it. 


In addition, the members of the Ex-
ecutive Committee are similar in tem-
perament, age, and outlook, similarities 
unlikely to be tempered by the infre-
quent interaction with the students on 
the Board. 


The store's management centers in 
Mr. Willoughby. His style is a dominating 
and controlling one. As the only source 
of information and analysis of the Co-
op's operations, he often makes his will 
Co-op policy, properly ratified by the 
various boards. Another result of his 
dominance is that the movement of policy 
is downward; hardly ever has policy re-
sulted from the few suggestions made 
by the student directors. 


The management group comes off as 
tight-lipped, set, and uninnovative. When 
considered together with Mr. Willoughby, 
the management's primary character-
istics are an unrelenting secretiveness, a 
lack of candor, a startling capacity for 
defensiveness, and, above all, loyalty to 
the present management. The secrecy 
in the store is not limited to information
