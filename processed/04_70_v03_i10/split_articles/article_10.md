abscond 
with 
sound 
Wander into a record store -
you probably 
won't believe all the records that you'll want. 
But they're too expensive. 
Perhaps we have an answer -the Sony-Superscope 
252 tape deck. With it you are ready to terrorize 
your friend's record collections. A copy of a stereo 
disk can be made for as I ittle as one fifth the cost of 
a record. And you won't have to flip between sides. 
The Sony-Superscope 252 is pretty close to one 
hundred dollars and David Dean Smith will 
guarantee it. (You won't have to ship it to 
god-knows-where if something breaks.) 
l et your friends buy records.
