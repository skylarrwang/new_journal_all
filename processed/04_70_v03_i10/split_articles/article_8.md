... Transformations 
It is common knowledge that young poets 
and novelists don't have to publish to 
grow. But people who write for the 
theatre must see their work produced to 
get a sense of what "works" on stage. 
Hence the importance of the Yale 
Repertory Company's newest theatre 
evening, Transformations, which con-
sists of three plays by Yale playwrights. 
The Rhesus Umbrella opens on a very 
pretty bundle of lights that represent a 
computer. Frequent black-outs, short 
scenes, and the deliberately flat style 
of reading lines makes the play into 
something of a cartoon. Doctor Harold 
., comes on stage worried about his son; he 
had opened the boy's briefcase and found 
turkish taffee. The computer (Albert) 
suggests the boy is in love. The boy eats 
a banana and says, "I think I'm in 
1 # 
love." And so on. Mr. Wanshel does not 
• fret over logical connections and neither 
should we. 

If I persist in taking the plot seriously 
I will be accused of a fearsome lack of 
intelligence. Unfortunately there is 
nothing else in the play to think about. 
The actors deserve better material - I 
just know that two actors jiving in th.e 
course of a meal can say funnier and more 
penetrating things. Mr. Wanshel was think· 
ing of something when he wrote this -
the man grows dependent on the ma-
chine, the boy grows into a monkey, the 
machine grows almost human - and 
these are ideas that could make a play. 
They make, instead, half-hearted jokes. 

The second play is David Epstein's 
two-character work, Clutch. It is the 
most economical and most effective 
play of the three, and it is more than 
admirably performed by David Ackroyd 
and Joan Pape. Aimed particularly at 
modern personal relationships, Ep-
stein's play centers on the automobile 
and the open road, seeing them as meta· 
phors for American life. The couple 
starts out as a pair of super-patriotic 
motor-cycle freaks; they are trans-
formed into a tired middle-aged couple 
bitchingin a car. 

In a play whose world is as ridiculous 
as it is inescapable, Ackroyd has found 
just the right style: a mixture of the 
clown's broad mime, and the dead 
seriousness of a man tackling the day's 
work. We recall him as the David Ackroyd 
who couldn't stand up straight in last 
season's Story Theatre. But even recog· 
nizing in his growth as a performer one 
good reason for having a Repertory 
company, we have to view the thinness, 
the weakness, of these plays as a necessary 
beginning: maybe next year will be a time 
for seeing how good the writing is. 

The third play , Iz She lzzy Or lz He 
Aint'zy Or lz They Both by Lonnie Car· 
ter, is the longest, and most demanding 
play of the evening. In a curious way it 
tells us more about comedy than the 
other plays, though it is not any fun-
nier. 

Finally, the reason Carter's play does 
not work has to do with the actors them-
selves, who are uncomfortable with his 
zaniness. Superficially, the style of the 
Marx brothers was a collection of sight 
gags, chases, vulgar puns, mockery of 
institutions, and fast talk that commented 
constantly on itself. Carter has that. 
What the Yale Rep actors could not fmd 
was what Peter O'Toole called "the blink· 
ered point of view" that lets you know 
that they could not possibly act other-
wise. The Yale actors own their bodies in 
the sense that a dancer does: they can 
assume a pace, can get a position right, 
but we don't believe them; their madness, 
especially in Carter's play, is not organic. 

The theatre Brustein talks about, the 
theatre of transformations, is one we are 
all looking forward to seeing. It is un-
nerving when Brustein thinks such a 
theatre is there, and it obviously is not. 
The playwrights have not transformed the 
their roots, TV comedy, into anything 
that threatens, enlightens, or excites us. 
The actors, for the most part, have not 
transformed themselves.
