**Title: The long blue line**

I've spent three and a half years in ROTC, 
and if there's one thing Army officers 
are proud of it's the long blue line of 
Yale officers. I recall vaguely that there 
was a mass meeting last year. Most people 
seem to think we abolished ROTC then. 
But President Brewster and the Corpo· 
ration seem to feel differently, since 
Reuben Holden has been energetically 
negotiating with the Department of the 
Army for a new contract. So ROTC is 
still here. And it's busy training officers. 

Just what goes on in that training? 

From the first day in the program you 
learn about the sanctity of the chain of 
command and the absolute necessity for 
unquestioning obedience to orders - no 
matter how odd. You are absolved from 
responsibility either to your men or to 
yourself in following your orders. This is 
degrading, but the army makes it up by 
having individual competitions for out· 
standing cadet of the week in drill per-
formance, superior cadet of the year for 
general achievement, expertise in marks· 
manship, as well as with unit competitions 
{best platoon for barracks cleanliness 
each day at summer camp). When you 
have all this excellence to strive for, it 
becomes easier and easier to be distracted 
from considering the nature of the war 
and the nature of the army. The really 
frightening thing is that these games we 
play in ROTC form the core activity in 
the real army, ofttimes even in Vietnam. 
It is reflected in the erroneous body 
counts we've heard about - it's more 
important for a unit to win the competi· 
tion for dead bodies than to fight a war. 
You focus on the trivial competition for 
status within the army - not on the war, 
since that is not necessarily justifiable, 
though a game always is. 

The ROTC program is designed to put 
you in command over other cadets. You 
are constantly told to upbraid your "in· 
feriors" on points of military discipline and 
conduct (such as haircuts, shined shoes, 
tardiness, etc.). The officers stress this 
particularly at summer camp, where a 
cadet platoon leader is graded on the 
amount of military efficiency he can pull 
out of the cadets "under" him. That the 
army attaches primary significance to 
this kind of training is shown in the fact 
that almost all platoon evaluators (and 
most officers in local ROTC programs) 
are higher ranking officers. Actual mili· 
tary skills are de-emphasized, and they 
are always taught by junior-grade officers. 
You spend only one day learning how to 
fire the entire arsenal of weapons (includ· 
ing tanks), and the rest of summer camp 
is spent learning techniques of control 
through the military games you play. 

Control through gamesmanship, a deadly 
game of Russian roulette in which every 
effort is made to detract from the fact 
that the gun is loaded. That's what offi. 
cer training is all about. 

You also hear all kinds of stories about 
Gls who deviate from the military norm 
(go AWOL, desert, steal from the army, 
etc.), and who are ergo deviants. No class 
is complete without one or two such 
stories. The proper method of handling 
deviants is, first, you ask them to 
straighten up, and then use techniques of 
punishment- Article IS's, cuts in pay· 
checks, fines and the stockade. Passes and 
leaves are to be used primarily for the pw· 
pose of discipline, rather than as responses 
to the human needs of Gls. And of course, 
there must be no nicety about shooting 
that supreme deviant, the GI who is re· 
calcitrantjn combat. After all, examples 
must be set. 

One officer explained to me the need 
to keep the men polishing their boots and 
shining their brass: if they are allowed to 
have any time to themselves, they will 
begin to bitch about the army, and a 
severe morale problem may develop. Keep 
them busy, keep them distracted, keep 
them mindless, because Gls, if left to 
their own devices, are trouble makers. 

Another thing I've noticed in the train· 
ing is the way blacks are regarded. I've 
tr:ied discussing my work with the New 
Haven Welfare Moms with a couple of 
officers, and I'm always met with the 
standard myths about black people -
that they are lazy, violent, like to be on 
welfare and are undependable. One offi· 
cer proved his point about blacks by glee-
fully telling about an all-black regiment 
in World War II that broke and ran before 
a clearly inferior German unit in the 
Battle of the Bulge. The military history 
course never mentions the role that black 
regiments played in winning the Revolu-
tionary War. In a three-month course on 
leadership techniques, we listened to tapes 
of problems which could arise between 
the officer and the GI. In about seventy-
five percent of the cases, the soldier, who 
was either drunk, violent or stupid, was 
black. 

Once the future officer is trained in 
these specific attitudes toward leadership 
there is the problem of making the latest 
objective of the army into "the enemy." 
We have seen two counter-insurgency 
fllms, both of which portray the people 
of an insurgent country as dumb and 
easily manipulable. Guerilla insurgents 
are portrayed as hysterical and blood· 
thirsty, slaughtering peasants right and 
left. Of course, the dumb peasants fall to 
the hysterical guerillas, and the even-
handed United States Army has to be 
called in to save the country from collapse. 
One of the few realistic scenes is one be· 
tween the United States ambassador and 
the local rulers, in which the ambassador 
promises all the resources of the United 
States to support them. 

When we are taught about the inter-
rogation of prisoners the instructors point 
out that the South Koreans, because of 
their small regard for the value of human 
life, are the best troops to use for extract· 
ing information from enemy soldiers. I 
have heard many a thrilling tale, told 
with great gusto, about how mercilessly 
the South Koreans carry out this mission 
in Vietnam. With the same sort of reason· 
ing we are also taught that this is why the 
Chinese Nationalists (under United States 
command) are so effective in Operation 
Phoenix - a systematic rooting out of the 
Viet Cong infrastructure in which each
