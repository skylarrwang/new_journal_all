village is given a monthly quota of bodies 
to turn in. 

Then there are the stories specifically 
about the Vietnamese. "Gook" is more 
frequently used than "Vietnamese." Sen-
sational hair-raising stories of atrocities 
committed by the Viet Cong are examined 
at length, atrocities which are of course 
peculiar to Oriental culture. The Viet-
namese are beasts, we are told, but very 
wily beasts, so you must be on your 
guard and not underestimate their fight-
ing strength. But once you trap the 
~ . wily beasts, they spill their guts and tell 
everything they know, because they are 
essentially chicken. 

One particularly cogent experience was 
the Vietnamese village exercise at summer 
camp. Since many ROTC officers will be 
going to Vietnam, the camp provides a 
simulated village which a platoon prac-
tices attacking, searching and destroying. 
82nd Airborne Rangers and their children 
are dressed up in black pajamas and play 
the roles of Vietnamese citizens. As we 
walked into the village, they paraded 
around like apes scratching their armpits 
and chattering like monkeys. The yellow 
peril lives. 

Utter contempt for the enemy based 
on his race is useful in popularizing the 
war. There can be problems, though. One 
officer told me that he knew of a platoon 
which was wiped out by the Viet Cong 
because the platoon leader had told his 
men that the Vietnamese people would 
• never get themselves together enough to 
fight the Americans. The officer told me 
not to make the same mistake; that I 
should point out to my men all the pecu-
liar aspects of the "Oriental" which make 
him on the one hand inhuman and on the 
other a clever fighter. 

ROTC training is all about controlling 
, , 
people who don't want to be controlled 
and fighting people who want the United 
States out of their country. Gamesman-
ship, contempt for the Gls (an added 
measure for black Gls) and contempt for 
the enemy are three primary techniques 
in the training. Yet, in spite of the fact 
that ROTC inculcates its cadets with 
these rather questionable values and atti-
tudes, the presence of the program on a 
~ university campus is apparently justifi-
able in many regards. 

I've heard a huge amount of talk about 
ROTC, but a lot of it doesn't relate at all 
to what ROTC actually does, i.e., provide 
the military with officers to help accom-
plish "national objectives." Some of the 
well-meaning but misleading arguments 
are that the course content of ROTC is 
inappropriate for a university; the in-
structors are unqualified; the program is 
professionally oriented; a binding con-
tract contradicts the premise of a liberal 
education; Yale ROTC humanizes the 
military; and the individual has a right to 
choose to join ROTC. 

From the standpoint of the university, 
much of what is taught in ROTC is edu-
cational. Military tactics, military history, 
leadership courses, the political significance 
of the military are not that much different 
from clearly legitimate areas such as 
political techniques and election studies, 
technological histocy, management tech-
niques, or industrial relations. There are 
tests, papers and lectures just as in most 
Yale courses. In many ways the courses 
are guts, but remember Margaret Mead? 
Ask any senior and he can list a half-dozen 
guts which receive full recognition t:iy 
Yale. 

The officers who teach the courses 
have had long experience in various parts 
of the Army directly related to the courses 
they teach. Engineers teach courses based 
on their experience and training which 
stress technological solutions to man's 
social problems. In an academic commu-
nity which stresses freedom for all ap-
proaches and views, Army officers 
logically should have the same right to 
teach courses which give military solu -
tions to social problems, solutions which 
stem from their experience and training. 

Professionalism is not only an attribute 
of ROTC, but also applies to photography, 
writing courses, and much of the scientific 
and engineering curricula. Professional 
schools abound in the Yale Community; if 
a student wants to decide a few years 
early what profession he wants to follow, 
why should Yale impede him? If Yale will 
admit students right out of high school 
into a professional training program in 
drama, why not allow them to enlist in a 
professional training program for the 
military? The professionalism-of-the-army 
argument also ignores that most ROTC 
contracts are only for two-year commis-
sions, hardly a lifetime career, and that 
the army is extremely diverse internally -
there are fighters, doctors, writers, lawyers, 
managers, administrators all within the 
army. And through the ROTC program 
there are numerous opportunities for 
graduate or professional training. In many 
ways the army simply mirrors society at 
large, something wh1ch Yale is supposedly 
preparing us to lead. 

With the draft facing most male stu-
dents, it seems that there is already a 
forced contract between the army and the 
student, and the ROTC contract is a mere 
refinement of this. The so-called binding 
contracts are not that hard to break. If a 
student wants out, he can usually get out 
just by talking to the head of the program; 
the contract will probably be tom up on 
the spot. Although there is more hassle 
for a scholarship student, it is still 
possible. 

In the report of the board of officers 
which interrogated me about disenroll-
ment, there is stated, "Cadet Green, by 
his action in requesting disenrollment, 
has demonstrated an immaturity, irre-
sponsibility and a lack of dependability 
that discredit his proved academic abil-
ities and make his effectiveness in a posi-
tion of responsibility doubtful and 
unpredictable." Requesting disenrollment 
was enough, according to this philosophy, 
to disqualify me from being an officer. 
The point is that if you don't want to be 
an officer, the army doesn't want you to 
be an officer. They have enough trouble 
with the enlisted personnel that the offi-
cers are supposed to be controlling. And 
of course specifically here at Yale, where 
ROTC has already been partially emas-
culated by the abolishment of course

credit and the removal of professorial title 
for ROTC officers, the question of a bind-
ing contract is very minor as the new 
contract with the Department of the Army 
will probably have a clause providing for 
the terminatiqn of the contract at any 
point. 

Ooesn 't ROTC humanize the army, 
especially ROTC at high-class schools like 
Yrue or Harvard? We know already that 
the majority of officers in the army are 
ROTC products, some of them Yale and 
Harvard products as well, and that the 
army still is not particularly humane. But 
let's analyze the argument a little further. 
The effect of junior officers is practically 
nil - they are trained to take their orders 
and in fact do take their orders or end 
up in the stockade just as any other 
soldier. And with an intense training pro-
gram which emphasizes leadership tech-
niques based upon supremacist, racial and 
social values, for how long can you expect 
even a Y alie to remain an even-minded 
humanitarian? The point is not that all 
Yalies are humane, but that Yalies may 
have higher college board scores than 
other people and thus be "brighter." We 
all know plenty of inhumane people at 
Yale who are generally quite clever about 
their inhumanity. (What about the flyer, 
"Fight poverty - sterilize the Welfare 
Moms"?) By putting cleverer people in 
the officer corps, however, the army is 
streamlined in its mission, which is, as 
I have been told over and over again, to 
seek out and destroy the enemy. Junior 
officers who zero in with more deadly 
aim or who drop napalm more accurately 
are the only "humane" results of having 
clever people from Yale in the army offi-
. cer corps. 

Even if Yale ROTC students were more 
humane than most people, the majority of 
them don't end up where they would have 
to question their roles as "humanitarians." 
They are put in non-combat or combat 
support branches where they can operate 
and manage efficient machines without 
having to confront their consciences di-
rectly with the uglier tasks of the army. 
By putting ''relative humanitarians" in 
non-combat positions, whether they come 
from Yale or elsewhere, the army rele9ses 
the less humanitarian elements to the front 
lines, where they can go to work with 
deadly efficient support from the humani· 
tarians. The army takes the most pro-
ficient organizers and managers and puts 
them in support jobs, and puts the re-
mainder in the infantry. It knows what it 
is doing. Only seven Yale ROTC graduates 
will be in the infantry this year, several 
by their own choice. Actions of "humane" 
individuals in the army tend to help the 
army in fulfilling its basic, non-humane 
function. 

The mainstay of the "keep ROTC" 
attitude is the rubric of academic freedom. 
If a man wants to become an officer then 
he has that right, and why shouldn't Yale 
provide him with the opportunity? The 
Yale administration condones the visits 
of recruiters from the major corporations, 
professional schools, government agencies -
and even allows Abbie Hoffman to speak 
here. So why shouldn't the military be 
free to recruit and ROTC be allowed to 
stay? 

But in the ivory tower epithets of aca· 
demic freedom we ignore a basic fact of 
the human condition, that man is a social 
animal, that his individual actions have 
direct consequences for social institutions 
and relations, and that many apparently 
individual actions form specific social 
institutions. ROTC is an example of the 
latter. So in asking the question about 
academic and individual freedom, if one 
is at all serious about it, one must ask, 
should a person have the right to pursue 
the activities of a given institution, or more 
sharply, should that institution exist? Do 
the tenets of academic freedom justify 
an establishment which prepares men to 
execute "national objectives" inimical 
to most people through means equally 
destructive to Gls? Should anyone have 
the right to participate in an institution 
which inculcates values contemptuous 
of vast numbers of people? If the value 
of academic freedom implies that we must 
accept an institution which acts on such 
attitudes as "blacks are violent and unde-
pendable," "Orientals place no value on 
human life," or "Gis tend to be de-
viants," then we ought to think twice. 

The question of individual right and the. 
social impact of exercising that right are 
inseparable. 

One must also consider ROTC's social 
role. Simply, how has it been used? It is 
the main source of junior leaders for the 
military. And how has this military been 
used? It has been used against the Viet-
namese people for many years, and this 
utilization is only the most highly esca-
lated example of similar intervention 
throughout the world by the American 
military in recent years. The military has 
been used against ghetto and campus resi· 
dents when milder ways of rejecting their 
demands have failed to stifle their mill· 
tancy. It has been used five times in the 
last two years to break strikes, as in the 
current dispute between the government 
and the postal workers. In each of these 
situations there are people who feel 
oppressed and who are trying to alleviate 
some of that oppression, moving towards 
greater control over their own lives 
through group action. 

This is the principle - freedom through 
self-determination - that Yale ostensibly 
desires for its children. Yet one way it 
puts this abstract notion into practice is 
ROTC, a mainstay of the military machine, 
which even in its own operation, often 
interferes with efforts at self-determina-
tion. It is a paradox, indeed, unless Yale 
sees that such a military is essential to 
allowing some kind of self-determination 
for its few elected elite. I doubt that most 
students would see things in that light. 

Whatever the motivation of the adminis· 
tration, it has fought every effort to 
abolish ROTC at Yale. We must be willing 
to fight also . •
