The f"nt entry - Monday: 
I think I am an artist. An artist of 
movie goma. At work, at my job, they 
think of me as cold, because I don't have 
coffee with them or make jokes. I have 
other concerns. Also they trunk of me as 
fat, although I am not. They think of me 
as enormously obese, as a grotesque fat 
man who waddles and has chafed lep. 
They joke about how I can't fit through 
doors. They have a pool to see who can 
guess my weight. The winner gets aU the 
coffee he wants. 

Second entry - Tuesday: 
Today I go to the Elpn. The ticket 
man will not look at me. It is because I 
am fat. Maybe he thinks I will get my 
fat on his tickets or I will spill food on 
him. He is an ass. I Jive him my two dol-
lars and ask for one. He presses his ma-
chine and the ticket comes out. He thinks 
the machine is copper - it's only brass 
it maybe copperplate. I go in. There 
are no ushers at the FJgin anymore. Only 
the ticket man. He used to be the usher. 
He went up and down the aisles shining 
his flashlight up girls' skirts when their 
feet were up on the chairs. Now he is 
only the ticket man. He no longer wears 
the usher's uniform with the rows of 
copper buttons and the yellow brushes 
on the shoulders. Maybe I will get a job 
as usher for the Elgin. They have no pop-
com there, only some crummy candy 
bar machines downstairs by the toilets. 
In Chelsea, where the Elgin is, there are 
only crazy people and Puerto Ricans now. 
But they have double features. Today is 
·Rosemary's Baby and Shameless Old 
Lady. Rosemary's Baby is good. You 
get to see he.- breasts and her ass. She 
David Freeman, a contributing editor, 
is presently preparing an anthology of 
his short stories, several of which first 
appeared in The New Journal. 
looks too skinny with her clothes on. 
Her- legs are skinny, but her breasts are 
good. The other- picture is dull - she 
wears her clothes. But I know what is 
under- them, and now that I know, I 
won't forget. In the Elgin there is an old 
man with his hat in his lap. When she 
is on the screen he plays with himself. 
He's fat and old. He sweats and his legs 
are chafed. He plays with himself when 
she is naked, he pretends he is screwing 
her. He thinks the hat cove.-s him, but be 
can't fool me. He is disgusting. At the 
office they take bets on how long he will 
live. "No one that fat will live," they 
say. "He plays with himself in the 
movies." He thinks he is the devil screw-
ing her. 

I stay to see Rosemary's Baby twice, 
but not the other one. The other one is 
stupid. I go home and sleep and chafe 
Rosemary's head with my fat legs. She 
knows I am the devil. She loves the red 
splotches on my lep. When I waddle on 
my chafed thighs, she says it is like 
Chaplin dancing. 

Third entry - Wednesday: 
We leave work early, at 3:00. They 
all go to a bar. I am invited, but I say 
no. It is early and I go downtown on the 
Lexington Ave. line to the Variety Photo 
Plays. I love the Variety Photo Plays. It's 
before f"ave and I can see the double fea-
ture for f"lfty cents: The Carpet Baggers 
and Son of Aubber. I feel goo4 at the 
Variety Photo Plays. It's full of old men. 
They sleep or go back and forth to the 
toilet. Some drink &om bottles wrapped 
in brown paper bags. They are all fools. 
In the lobby is my favorite picture: a 
color portrait of Wild Bill Elliot. It is 
signed, "Your pal Bill Elliot." The best 
thing about it is that it's always there. 
Bill Elliot is always my pal. I sit down 
front. I am the only one in my row. I 
sit as far &om the toilet as I can. Martha 
Hyer is in it. That's alii can remember. 
I go cross town to the Loew's Sheri-
dan. Riot. I don't like it. While I am in 
·line for my ticket they all say it's are-
make of The Informer by John Ford. 
They mean Uptight. They are so dumb. 
On the marquee it says "Jim Brown in 
Riot with Mike Killin." Killin. They are 
so dumb at the Loew's Sheridan. They 
don't even know it's Kellin. I don't like 
the movie. The Informer was better. Jim 
Brown can't act. He only gets parts be-
cause be was a football star and because 
he is black. On the way out I see the 
marquee again. Killin. lao to a phone 
booth across the street and caD the man-
aaer of the Loew's Sheridan. Her-e is what 
we said: 
••b this the JD8D81el' of the Loew's 
Sher-idan?" 
"Yes." 
•"'bis is Syd Ferrullo." (I make up a 
name and it's mine.) ... represent Mike 
Kellin the actor starring in Riot. The 
film you're now showing." 
"Oh yes Mr. Ferrullo." (He's hooked -
IUCkin& up to me. I have him now. Mine.) 
.. Yes. I'm Mr. Mike Kellin's penoaal 
maJI8Iel' and I noticed this mominc u 
I went by the Loew's Sheridan tb.t you 
spelled my dient's name wronJ on the 
marquee. You have an I wher-e an E 
should be." 
.. Oh, I hadn't noticed." 
.. This is unthinkable. You could lose 
your license. One call from me to the 
home office and you would lose your 
license." 
..Well sometimes they run out of let-
ters. E's break very easily and some-
times they have to substitute. They only 
substitute vowels for vowels." 
.. 1 am a very busy man and I must 
get back to Hollywood. You must cor-
rect this indignity, or I will cause you 
to lose your license." 
.. I'm sure we can straiJbten it out -" 
.. But I can't do it right a~y - that's 
a union job, the union man's gone home." 
.. Fix it immediately or lose your li-
cense. I will check it out on my way to 
Hollywood. Tonight. Goodbye." I hang 
up and go to a restaurant and watch. 
Pretty soon a bald man and an usher with 
a ladder come out. The usher goes up and 
_the bald man yells at him. They break up 
another letter and use it to tum the I 
into an E. They f"mish and I leave. Mike 
Kellin has been avenged. I am his guard-
ian. I will be his P.R. man and avenge 
him. I will go all over- the world for him, 
searching the marquees of the world for 
Mike Kellin, protecting his name. 

Fourth entry - Friday: 
They are going to a bar again. After 
work they all go to The Pub. I have 
never- been there. This time I am not 
invited. One of them said "Let's go to 
The Pub, everybody." Then someone 
else said .. Thank god it's Friday." They 
say this every Friday, before they 10 to 
The Pub. Sometimes I am asked specifical-
ly to go. But not this time. Once, one girl, 
Miss Ginsberg, asked me to go. Specif"ICal-
ly. I said I was going away for the week-
end. She has not asked me again. She is a 
fde clerk, very young. I got he.- fde. She 
is 19 and has skinny legs and long brown 
hair. That is the advantage of being in 
the personnel department. The files are 
for me. She can have no secrets from me. 
Only I may see the fdes. Miss Ginsberg 
is 19. I am 34. 

I go early to The New Yorker and I see 
The Pickpocket. It only costs a dollar. 
The New Yorker bas the best popcorn 
of all the theatres. As usual it is fresh. 
Big white kernels. It costs twenty-fave 
cents. That is not too bad. The lady who 
sells it is my friend. She smiles at me. 
Perhaps she owns The New Yorker-. Or 
hu husband. She doesn't like to seD 
candy or ice cream, only to make pop-
com. She makes it for me. Otbe.-s may 
have popcorn too, but only when I per-
mit it. The film is good. A pic.kpocket 
in Paris. He wants to stop but he can't. 
No mattu what, he must pick pockets. 
He practices till be is the best pickpocket 
in Paris. He lives only to pick pockets. 
He is an artist of pocket picking. I under-
and this. In the movie all the doon are 
unlOcked. There are shots that show this 
cleuty. It's not an accident. Perbapa it 
means that even when doors are open be
