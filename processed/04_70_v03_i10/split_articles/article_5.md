EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
cannot walk through them - he cannot 
stop picking pockets, even though he 
wants to. I do not understand this. The 
picture is by Bresson. It is short and I 
see it twice. Still I do not understand the 
open doors. On the way out the popcorn 
lady smiles at me. She says "Nighty 
Night." I say nothing. Nighty night. 

Fifth entry - Saturday: 
No work today. I go to the movies. I 
see Shoot The Piano Player. This is one 
of my favorite movies. But this time 
something is different. Miss Ginsberg is 
in it. She plays a small part at the begin-
ning. I didn't know she had been to 
France. This is not in her file. I must 
bring it up to date. It will be our secret. 
Next I see Reflections in a Golden Eye 
at the Baronet. It is too serious. The 
people are all crazy. I do not under-
stand it. Elizabeth Taylor was too fat. I 
watch only once and leave. I go to see 
The Killing of Sister George, at the 
Orleans. It is much better. It is a movie 
about a fat man with chafed legs. He 
rapes a young girl of 19 who works in 
an office. She is so repelled by him that 
she dies. She sees his fat stomach and 
smells his sweat and his chafed legs and 
dies. He is so fat that the insides of his 
pants legs are worn through from rubbing 
together. She sees this, so he rapes her. 
She gets sick from his weight on her and 
vomits. She strangles on her vomit be-
cause he wilJ not let her up. He rubs the 
vomit on her stomach and then he comes 
into the vomit. It mixes together and 
makes a devil. Then the devil rapes her. 
It is in technicolor. There is also a coming 
attraction for Secret Ceremony. More 
Elizabeth Taylor. 

Besides being a fale clerk, Miss Gins-
berg is in the movies. She is only a r.Je 
clerk by day. At night she is in the movies. 
Not a star, but someday perhaps. She is 
a starlet. She was in Rosemary's Baby, 
it was her biggest part to date. She made 
love to the devil. I saw her breasts and 
her ass. I will make her a star. I will 
make her the moon. No one must know 
of this. 

At night I go to the Elgin. I see a 
double feature of Love in the Afternoon 
and Breakfast at Tiffany's, both starring 
Miss Ginsberg. A strange thing happens. 
During the fmt one, Love in the After-
noon, Miss Ginsberg was talking quietly 
with Maurice Chevalier who plays her 
father, the private detective, and in the 
next frame, she was ten years older and 
in bed with George Peppard. In techni-
color. Everyone in the audience laughed 
and then the movie went off. I am not 
sure what to make of this, perhaps Miss 
Ginsberg is giving me a signal, it's hard to 
teD 'if this was an accident or a code. 

Sixth entry- Sunday: 
Viridiana. I will watch it twice, may-
be more. It is a great movie. At The 
Charles. That means dry popcorn, but 
1 will go to see Viridiana. In The Charles 
you can hear people cough and gag on 
the gluey popcorn. It has no butter only 
salt. 

It was a bad print and the sound track 
was fuzzy, but it was pretty much in fo-
cus and it was all there. Sometimes it is 
cut and you don't get to see the scene 
where Viridiana puts the salve on the 
leper's arm. That is a good shot. He stares 
at her white skin and her teeth and she 
caresses his rotting arm. I saw it three 
times. I love the banquet scene when the 
old man fucks the cook and the blind 
man goes wild. He destroys the banquet 
with his cane. He hates the man who is 
fucking the cook. And he hates the cook. 
But he can't do anything because he is 
blind. So he eats some more of the cook's 
custard, then wrecks everything. And the 
old man still fucks the cook. No matter 
what the blind man does the old man will 
still fuck the cook till he's through. So 
the blind man might as weD eat the cus-
tard. Viridiana has white skin and skinny 
legs. I will confess to y~u that when Don 
Jairnie drugs her and tries to Tape her, I 
play with myself. I use my coat in my lap 
so no one can know. Don Jaimie cannot 
do it. He is a coward. I can.do it. 

Tonight I saw Miss Ginsberg in SomeÂ· 
thing for the Boys at the Thalia, where 
they are showing funny old movies. The 
audience is usually full of queers who 
laugh hysterically at the stupid parts. 
In this one Miss Ginsberg played Carmen 
Miranda who was a lady riveter. It was 
her job to rivet the airplanes to beat the 
Japs. She worked on a long line of lady 
riveters, riveting the bulls of B-47's. The 
problem was that she worked so hard to 
beat the Japs that she kept getting metal 
fdings from the rivets in her mouth, 
which turned her teeth into a radio. She 
wore tight denim overalls and whenever 
The Andrews Sisters carne over her teeth 
singing "Bei Mir Bist Du Shein," all the 
riveters would stop working on the B-47's 
and sing and dance for a while. Miss Gins-
berg was very good. In one scene she wore 
a big hat with apples and grapes on it. 
Phil Silvers was also in the picture. 

Next I see The Impossible Years at 
the Coronet. Although she is not on the 
marquee, Miss Ginsberg is in it. Not the 
lead, but in it. She plays the daughter of 
a psychiatrist, David Niven. She is in a 
bikini. I know it is Miss Ginsberg. I recog-
nize the breasts and the skinny legs. I 
have seen the devil screwing her and I 
know her. I go to the phone in the men's 
room and call the manager. I tell him I 
am the manager of Miss Sharon Ginsberg 
and she has not received proper billing. 
He is not as scared as the manager of the 
Loew's Sheridan. He says he has billing 
instructions and they do not include 
Miss Ginsberg. He hangs up. Miss Gins-
berg is in trouble. Her career is not going 
weU. Fucked by the devil and no billing 
at the Coronet. She needs help. I will 
help her career. I will hijack the IRT and 
take her out to Hollywood. We will hi-
jack it together. I will drive the first car, 
battling off Indians and conductors. Miss 
Ginsberg will bandage my wounds and 
bring me food to give me strength to 
guide the IRT across the mountains and 
over the desert and onto Hollywood. 

It is possible that her name was in the 
final titles - they closed the curtains be-
fore I could tell. That is the thing I hate 
the most - closing the curtains during the 
final titles. I love good titles. Titles make 
a movie mean somethlns. Sometimes they

( 
open and shut the curtains at the begin-
ning - right on the movie during the 
titles, for no reason. They do this at 
many theatres and it's a terrible thing. 

My favorite titles are From Russia With 
Love. At night I saw Beast That Walks 
Like a Man at the Variety Photo Plays. 
The titles came out of the monster's 
mouth. At The Variety Photo Plays they 
never close the curtain, because they 
don't have one. That is why I like the 
Variety Photo Plays. Once at The Win-
ston they shut the curtains on the last 
shot of Killer's Kiss. I called the manager 
to complain. I said I was Darryl Zanuck 
and their stupidity was ruining my movie. 
He didn't believe me. He said if I called 
again, he'd have the call traced. But I 
know more than he thinks. I only call 
from phone booths - let them trace, it 
won't prove a thing. Darryl Zanuck knows 
more than the manager of The Winston 
can ever dream of. 

Seventh entry - Monday: 
After work I go home on the IRT. I 
see Miss Ginsberg on the train. On the 
IRT! She shouldn't be here. She should 
be at rehearsals or making her movie. 
I see her but I look into my Post , at the 
movie clock. Today she came to my 
desk and said something. She asked me 
where I live. I couldn't tell her. I didn't 
know. I said the West side. I tell her I 
enjoyed her performance in Rosemary's 
Baby. She laughs. She doesn't remember 
that I am the devil. She was asleep when 
I screwed her. She cannot remember, 
but I do. She is still laughing. She touches 
my arm. On the IRT she touches my 
arm. No one must know of this. 

Eighth entry - Wednesday: 
No work yesterday. I called in and said 
I was sick. I stayed in bed all morning. 
Miss Ginsberg may know I am the devil 
in Rosemary's Baby, but she must not 
speak of this. This must be our secret . 

In the afternoon I go to 66th. St. and 
fmd her building and study it. She lives 
on the fourth floor. I try to fmd her win-
dow. Many people go in and out of the 
building. None of them are in the movies. 
None of them are Miss Ginsberg. None of 
them know the devil's chafed thighs. Af-
ter studying her building I go to Yellow 
Submarine. Young girls no longer scream 
at The Beatles. During the first Beatles 
movie they aU screamed. I watched one 
time from the middle of screaming girls, 
but none of them touched my arm. The 
movie is not bad. I take a cab home. 

N'mth entry - Thursday: 
She asks me where I was yesterday. I 
teD her I was sick. She says if it happens 
again I should call her and she will bring 
me chicken soup. Then she laughs. Chick-
en soup is a big joke to her. This is un-
thinkable. She will bring me chicken 
soup, she will bathe my leper's ann and 
my chafed thighs in chicken soup. After 
work I follow her. I get in the car behind 
her and foDow her to 66th. St. It is winter 
and dark. She doesn't see me. 

Tenth entry - Friday: 
Today in the newspaper. We will sell 
the film rights to our story. Miss Gins-
berg and I will split the money. It is her 
story too - our story, together. We will 
parachute through sides of chicken soup 
dowb into Hollywood. She will caress my 
chafed thighs as we faD. We will be in 
the movies, she and I. My story was in 
the Daily News and the Post. The Times 
did not cover it. I don't know if it was on 
T.V. Perhaps it will be in the newsreels. 
Here is our story from the Post: 
ATTEMPTED RAPE 
A 24 year old Bronx housewife was 
attacked early today near her home on 
I 67th St. 
The woman said a man with a ski mask 
jumped out of an alley and "ripped my 
blouse." 
The woman's screams apparently drove 
her assailant away. 
Police are investigating. 

A perfect disguise. Miss Ginsberg has pur-
posely thrown the police off my trail. 
Bambi is out of the flames, the danger 
has passed. She is on my side, and now I 
can proceed. 

Eleventh entry - Sunday: 
Today I see Rachel Rachel. It is very 
good: a boy and a girl carrying a trunk 
with brass buckles parachute from the sky 
and fall on the beach. They open the 
trunk and an old drunk in baggy pants 
and a sleeveless undershirt gets out. He 
can't walk straight. He tries, but he can't 
even get back in the trunk. The boy and 
girl laugh at him and then make love, 
only she is very coy and won't let him, 
because his thighs are chafed. He ties the 
drunk to a tree and tries to rape her. 
But the drunk promises the leper money 
if he will kill the fat man before he rapes 
her. The leper hits the fatman on his 
chafed thighs with the brass buckles, 
and Viridiana is saved for Don Jaintie 's 
son. Then they all pick up the trunk with 
the brass buckles and run into the ocean 
which is chicken soup. The end. This is 
a good film. It is the f'lrst one Paul New-
man ever- directed. 

After Rachel Rachel I go to the River-
side which is near Miss Ginsberg's house. 
Sometimes movie stars go to neighbor-
hood theatres to see their films, unno-
ticed. I look for her, but she doesn't show 
up. The movie is Hot Millions with Peter 
Ustinov. lt is about a robbery. I don't 
like it. During the movie I watch a taU 
skinny man play with himself. He slumps 
down in the second row until he is one 
with himself. He is a very skinny man 
and his teeth are like a transistor radio. 

Twelfth entry - Monday: 
Miss Ginsberg is at work today. She 
acts like nothing has happened. This is 
good, part of the code. She smiles at 
me and comes to my desk to speak. Here 
is what we said: 
"You're so thin - don't you eat any-
thing?" 
" I'm very overweight." 
"Oh yeah, and I'm in Rosemary's 
Baby." 
"Shh. Don't let anyone know." 

Then she laughed and went away. This is 
good. She speaks in code with me. Only 
I know what she means. She wears a 
brown mini-skirt today and a tight blouse. 
It covers her from the others, but not 
from me. I am the devil and I have eyes 
that can see her soul. No one must know 

Today I am disguised as a fat man. 
No one will know me. I will fmd Miss 
~msberg after she gets off the i'RT and 
we will make our movie. Dumbo will fly 
tonight. I move quietly through the 
cars when the train is stopped at Colum-
bus Circle. She is in the car just ahead 
and I can see her through the doors. I 
cover my face with the Post, looking at 
the movie clock. Perhaps afterwards I 
will see Fireman's BaD at Cinema II. She 
gets off at 66th. St. as usual, and I fol-
low. I stay in the shadows of the 66th. 
St. station and she cannot see me. My 
disguise is perfect. I am cli1guised as a 
fat shadow. I can move easily without 
her seeing me. For a fat man I am very 
graceful. I follow her brown hair up 66th. 
St. towards the park, and grab her arm 
from behind. Here is what we said: 
" Well, hi. Do you live around here?" 
" We must make a movie." 
" What's aU this movie stuff with you, 
anyway?" 
" I am the devil." 
" I didn't see that one." 
" You are Rosemary's Baby and I am 
the devil with eyes that can see your 
soul." 
" Boy you are really nuts." 
"Bambi is in the flames." 
"Oh I love Bambi. And Thumper. I 
saw it when I was a little girl. I saw Rose-
mary's Baby, too. It was scary." 
"There is no more hope. Dumbo flies 
tonight." 
" I live right here - why don't you 
come up for a while. I'D bet you haven't 
had dinner yet - from the look of you, 
you never have dinner." 
"No, no. Good-bye." 
"I could make a tuna casserole ... " 

I didn't hear what she said after that -
I had to run, there will be no f'ilining to-
night. 

I go to see The Fireman's Ball.
