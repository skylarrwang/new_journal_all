TNJ: Were you offered one? 
Brewster: No, no, heavens no. 

TNJ: Where are your efforts directed 
now? 
Brewster : I'm writing a book. 

TNJ: On what subject? 
Brewster: Well, the book is about how 
to keep American society open, free 
and mobile, and at the same time face 
the challenge of big government, big 
business and the slow down of eco-
nomic activity. It's also about how to 
keep American society volu ntary in

economic activity. 

TNJ: Was your book at all inspired by 
your experiences in England? 
Brewster: In part, yes. The ideas 
didn't come so much from being in 
England, but I got a new perspective 
which made me realize how unique 
among nations the United States is. 
Suddenly I became aware of the fact 
that ours is almost unique, with the 
possible exceptions of Canada and 
Australia, in starting afresh with no 
feudal tradition and within an infinite 
amount of space and an infinite 
amount of resources, so the whole 
spirit is one of fresh start, a second 
chance, mobility, whereas in a con-
fined island society with feudal tradi-
tion, people really do expect to die 
where they're born and there's a great 
deal of local loyalty and with it m uch 
less tradition of mobility and spirit of 
change. 

TNJ: So England provided a contraSt? 
Brewster: Yes, a contrast. You realize 
how distinctive our feeling of elbow-
room and mobility is, but also how dif-
ficult it is going to be to maintain that. 

T NJ : Do you sec any parallels betwe~n 
the kind of economic, ractal and soctal 
:iisruption that's taking place in 
England now and the period of unrest 
in the late '60s? 
Brewster: No, I think it's quite dif-
ferent. 

TNJ: How? 
Brewster: Well, I think the period of 
unrest in England is very much a func-
tion of prolonged unemployment going 
way back to the collapse of some of the 
port cities like Liverpool and Glasgow 
and Newcastle. In England you don't 
have anything like a home-grown 
minority which has been oppressed for 
centuries the way we do. The kind of 
struggle for black self-respect and black 
identity had a lot to do with the mood 
of the late '60s. But most of all, the ac-
tivists of the '60s, when America was 
mostly middle-class, were affiuent kids 
who were the last spoiled generation. I 
mean it was before the recession of '71 
and it was at the end of a really 
unusual boom so its economic and 
social circumstances were just the op-
posite from the British. 

TNJ: Twice in your life you've been in 
an official position during a time of 
great social unrest. How do you think 
that's affected you? 
Brewster : Oh, I think it makes you 
aware of the speed of change. When I 
was chosen as president in '63, if 
anyone had said, "well by halfway 
through your term you'll be dealing 
with earthquakes that threaten the ex-
istence of the whole place," I would 
have said, "don't be ridiculous." And 
likewise if when I went to England 
someone had said, "during the course 
of your ambassadorship there will be a 
180 degree turn in the direction of 
British public policy- both domestic 
and international," I would have said, 
"don't be ridiculous." I think the main 
way in which it affects me is to be 
aware of the very limited validity of 
any predictions about fundamental 
social trends and the fact that, at least 
in my time, the changes have been ab-
solutely extraordinary. 

TNJ: You use the word "earthquake." 
Do you think Yale could have been 
pulled apart? 
Brewster: Yes, and many universities 
were; that is, Harvard and Columbia 
in particular were terribly polarized 

T NJ: Did you see yourself as part of 
the glue that kept things together? 
Brewster: Oh sure. Well not just me, 
but I think there were a lot of people

with different kinds of responsibilities 
not just in Woodbridge Hall, but some 
of the colleges masters and some of the 
alumni. I think my role was made a lot 
easier by the fact that there were really 
no sectors of the university that I didn't 
know intimately by somebody who is 
known intimately by. me. That's very 
important in a situation of trouble, 
when vou have a few malevolent 
charact~rs around- and most of them 
are not- being able to make up your 
mind what the difference is between a 
knave and a fool is crucial, and there's 
no clear way of doing that if you don't 
have that kind of situation where 
there's someone you can turn to who 
really will know the individual about 
whom you're trying to make a judg-
ment. 

TNJ: I recall seeing the film Bnght Col-
lege Years and hearing Jerry Rubin at 
the podium yelling one sort of obsceni-
ty or another. How did you feel per-
sonally about that? 
Brewster: Cy Vance and I went over 
to Ezra Stiles-to hear Abbie Hoffman. 
We thought he'd be the most obscene 
and I guess it was Jerry Rubin who 
was talking about "Kingston Brewer" 
or something like that. It's not that 
they were without convictions, but I 
don't take any of that personally. The 
students, on the whole, were magnifi-
cent. I don't mean that in terms of their 
support of me, but their support of the 
institution. 

And of course Mr. 
Agnew's speech calling for the alumni 
to get rid of me was a great help as far 
as students were concerned. If Agnew's 
against you, you can't be all bad. And 
so that was a happy coincidence. The 
great failure of course is if you make 
some horrible mistake and you feel 
that you were personally responsible 
for things going wrong.

TNJ: But you never felt that? 
Brewster: Sure, sure. I was terrified 
that something would go·wrong and it 
would be my fault. And one of the 
reasons that I wanted to be sure that 
we had an expert witness in the cor-
poration in town was so that if things 
did go wrong the corporation wouldn't 
have to rely on me as their only witness 
to sort of explain what happened, and 
so we got Cy Vance. It was a delicate 
relationship all around because in a 
curious way- although the Chief of 
Police in New Haven was very helpful 
and very cooperative and very bold 
-the mayor was terrified and very ..-1 
hostile to Yale. 

TNJ: Who was this? 
Brewster: Bartholomew Guida, who 
was not an evil person, but he was real-
ly terrified of this thing and did not 
want to cooperate with Yale. Sam 
Chauncey and I went down to talk 
with Guida and the Chief of Police and 
it was quite clear that we just were not 
going to get any cooperation at all and 
so we saw the Chief afterwards. He 
said, "now, I've been instructed not to 
cooperate with you, but I'm not gonna 
pay any attention to it." And so we had 
total cooperation with Jim Ahearn and 
that .was absolutely crucial so that he 
would not invoke any confrontational 
activities until we had exhausted the 
possibility of keeping the adversaries 
apart. It could have been a Kent State 
situation if we hadn't had that coopera-
tion . ..Jn addition, we did, before the 
actual, occasion, succeed in getting the 
National Guard to stay out of the 
downtown area and lots of different 
people take credit for that but that's all 
right. 

TNJ: Was that your decision? 
Brewster: Well, yeah, it was the result 
of when Cy came here and advised us 
about preparations. We got in touch 
with the representative of the Depart-



TNJ: You once said that you were 
skeptical of the ability of the Black 
Panthers a nd ... 
Brewster: A black revolutionary. 

TNJ: . . . to receive a fair trial in this 
country. Do you still feel that's true? 
Brewster: I think that situation's im-
proved a lot. Some people claim that 
my statement was never intended to be 
a public statement, because it was 
made at a faculty meeting which was 
closed, and was leaked. 

TNJ: Don't you think it's naive to ex-
pect that it wouldn't be leaked? 
Brewster: 
O h , 
I didn't expect it 
wouldn't be. 

TNJ: Well then you expected it to be 
released in the course of a public state-
Brewster: Well, I made it even though 
I knew it was likely to be public. 

TNJ: H ow did the alumni react to 
your remark? 
Brewster: First telegram I received- I 
wish I knew who sent it-said, "Spiro 
Agnew, what class was he?" T his was 
when Agnew told the Yale alumni they 
should ask for my resignation, as 
though the president was appointed 
by the alumni, but the telegrams we 
received were about 3 to 1 supportive. 
T here were a lot of people who were 
turned ofT by a great many different 
things of which my statement was just 
one. Some people were turned ofT by 
Brtwstn-
poor education. Some people were 
turned ofT by a more aggressive admis-
sions policy that would let people from 
a greater variety of backgrounds in 
schools. Some people were turned off 
by my anti-war stance and some peo-
ple were turned ofT by Coffin. Some 
people were turned ofT by so-caUed 
Black Panther statements, and so -it's 
very hard to measure these things. 

TNJ: You had conflicts with a lot of 
alum ni. 
Brewster: Well, some. 

T NJ: Do you think that was because 
that you had fundamentally different 
values than they, or that you were un-
ble tO communicate your precise pur-
poses to them? 
Brewster: No, I think they disagreed. 
A good u niversity stands halfway be-
tween the generations. The older 
alumni, who have a nostalgic image of 
the university that they think is their 
university, and the younger students, 
who have their own image of what a 
university ought to be, are bound to 
diverge; and it's not surprising that the 
admmtstratlon of an alert university 
sometimes gets stretched between these 
two. As I said at the inauguration of 
my friend Ma.nin Meyerson when he 
became chancellor of the Buffalo cam-

pus at the University of New York, 
you have to say to the alumni that he 
who would commission the composer 
better not try to call the tune, just the 
way you have to tell the students that 
ours is not a business in which the 
customer is always right. 

TNJ: Alumni might differ with you on 
that. There was a lot of pressure on 
you, R. Inslee Clark, the D1rector of 
Admissions and Henry Chauncey, Jr. 
when you initiated your new admis-
sions standard-when you attempted 
to broaden the base of students and the 
number of alumni- aiTtliated students 
went from 20 per cent of the class to 14 
per cent of the class. 
Brewster: Oh, I ... alumni won't ob-
ject, but that's different from pressure: 
that is ... 

TNJ: The money stopped, didn't it? 
Brewster: No. 

TNJ: It slowed down? 
Brewster: Well, it's hard to tell. That's 
one of the hardest things to tell becauc;e 
some people, who had been turned ofT 
because they thought Yale was getting 
dull and parochial and ingrown, came 
to life and unzipped their pocketbooks 
because of these changes. co-edu-
