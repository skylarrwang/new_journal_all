An 
Interview 
with 
Kingman 
Brewster 
Fonna Yale Presidrnt and Janna Am-
bassador 
to 
Great 
Britain, 
Brewster holds the distinction of having hero 
attacked by both Spiro Agnew and ]my 
Rubin. Finding Brewsta too libaal, Agnew 
once called on Yale alumni to ask for 
Brewsta's resignation. Finding Brewsta not 
libaal enough, Rubin stood on the green dur-
ing the May Day rallies and yelled, "F--k 
Kingman Brewu. â€¢ 
Brewsta was prtsldent from 1963 to 
1977, a period of turbulence and transition. 
Under his administration, Yale not onry 
became co-educational, but also weathaed the 
stonn of the May Day protests portrayed in 
the documentary Bright College Years. 
From 1977 to 1981, Brewsta saved as 
ambassador to Great Britain dun"ng that na-
tion's swing Inwards Thatchaism, and a 
period of mounting social tensions that lata 
lead to riots. Now back in New Haven, 
Brewsta lives a Jew blocks from the Yale 
campus. 
Kingman Brewsta today.

TNJ: I'm interested in what it feels like 
to be back in New H aven. 
Brewster: Oh, well, I can give you a 
different answer now than I would 
have given you a month ago because 
we've just been back to England for the 
first t\me since we left the embassy a nd 
we realize how fond we a re of the 
place. We love it over there, but I say 
that because, of all the places we could 
be, I'd rather be back here in New 
H aven than anywhere else for two 
reasons. One is I'm spoiled . I've spent 
all my time at university campuses, ex-
cept for the war and the embassy, and 
I would miss the diversity of opinion 
and the chance to argue continuously 
with everybody you meet. Secondly, 
when you get as old as we are, it's j ust a 
heck of a lot more relaxing to come 
back where if you stumbled and fell o n 
the pavement people would pick you 
up. If you're in a community where 
you have a lot of friends, a lot of ac-
quaintances, where you're known, it's 
a heck of a lot easier to handle the re-
entry problem. 


TNJ: Do you get over to Yale fre-
quently? 
Brewster: Well, it's more of a semi-
social circu it. I've been trying to stay 
out of Yale affairs, turning down in-
vitations to appear before common 
rooms or the Political Union or what-
not, because I am very eager to make 
my return here as a civilian you might 
say, with no sense of identification 
with or responsib ility for u niversity af-
fairs. I do not wish to be a kind of 
shadow on Bart G iamatti's Yale. On 
the other hand , I lind it impossible n ot 
to return to Yale as we instead of they. 


TNJ: You're sentimental. 
Brewster: It is very much we 


TNJ: Would you teach over there? 
Brewster: Well, I didn't want a faculty 
appointment I did not want a Yale ap-
pointment.
