Rhyming 
for a reason 
Lelia Wardwell 
Rhyme's Reason 
by J obn Hollander 
1981 Yale University Press 54 pp. 
There are rhythms like this that you'll 
frequently meet, 
They resound with the 
pounding of regular feet, 
And their anapests carry 
a narrative load 
(The hoofbeats of horses, of 
course, on the road). 
What does an English professor do 
when he is asked to explain a specific 
verse form in a poetry class? If, like 
John Hollander, the English professor 
is also a poet, he may simply write his 
own example on the blackboard, in-
stead of providing a formal definition 
or quoting an example from another 
poet's work. Hollander often writes his 
own demonstrative 
verse 
for 
his 
classes, he said, out of "a funny kind of 
laziness," which comes from writing 
verse since he was 14. 

Hollander's examples are verse 
fragments, written in the poetical form 
of rhyme, structure or rhythm which 
they explain. He recently published 
some of them in Literature as Experience, 
an anthology he worked on with Irving 
Howe and David Bromwich. Now he 
has reprinted his work, along with a 
brief text of definitions and explana-
tions, in his own book, Rhyme's Reason. 
Rhyme's Reason is not a theoretical ex-
amination of poetry. It is a short, in-
formative book which explains and il-
lustrates formal elements in English 
verse. 

Hollander describes char-
acteristics that have existed in poetry 
from ancient Greek verse up to 
modem forms such as free verse, 
popular song and even the Blues. His 
text is simple and clear, and his verse 
graceful. His blues example is especial-
ly witty: 
Now a blues has stanzas, stanzas of a 
funny lcind-
Yes a blues has stanzas 
of a eery funny lcind; 
(Do that line again, singer, whik you 
11l.tJke up your mind) . . . 

He also gives an example of a one line 
poem: "The Universe. • 

Hollander does not consider Rhyme's 
Reason a major achievement. He called 
it his "fun little book," a project which 
took little time and effort on his part. 
He decided to write it because he 
realized that most students (including 
English Majors and many of their 
teachers) are not familiar with the for-
mal elements of verse he has worked 
with all his life. He wrote in his in-
troduction, "The most popular verse 
form in America today ... is 
a lcind of free verse 
without any special 
constraints on it except 
those imposed by 
the notion - also 
generally accepted-that 
the stnp the lines 
11l.tJke as they run 
down the page (the 
familiar strip with the 
jagged nght-hand edge) not 
be too wide. 

Poetry, he said, is too often iden-
tified by its "hemline" rather than by its 
sound.
