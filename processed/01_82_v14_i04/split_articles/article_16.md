â€¢. . . it was not our purpose to entertain the 
city of New Haven. We were functioning in 
a university and therefore wanted the same 
privileges as a laboratory scientist or a literary 
researcher. 

It was our responsibility, I 
thought, to explore, to experiment, to develop 
new techniques, 
to rediscover neglected 
works- in short, to perform the theatrical 
equivalent of basic research. 

Besides, New Haven already had its own 
community theatre- the Long Wharf 
- Robert Brustein, Making Scenes. 

The Long Wharf and the Yale Reper-
tory theatres have played leading roles 
in the regional theatres' movement 
since its very beginning. But how have 
these two major repertory companies 
co-existed, for more than 15 years, in 
New Haven- a 
city of less than 
150,000? 

Possibly because they have used two 
different strategies to assert their 
reputations and attract the audiences. 

The Yale Rep, having Robert Brustein 
as its founder and artistic director for 
13 years, received local and national 
attention for the polemic and often 
disturbing nature of its productions; 
the Long Wharf, directed by Arvin 
Brown since 1966, conquered a large 
constituency from New Haven and its 
surrounding areas through the com-
bination of an eclectic repertory and a 
highly professional standard of produc-
tion. 

The idea of a resident theatre com-
pany had a different meaning for each 
artistic director. Brown emphasized its 
character as a regional theatre; he tried 
to bring to New Haven the excellence 
of Broadway productions, and thus 
created a quality "consumer theatre" 
-a Circle-in-the-Square outside New 
York. For Brustein, the adventurous 
ideal of a resident company was the 
very opposite of a consumer theatre, 
and essentially anti-Broadway in its 
cultural concerns and aesthetic values. 

According to him, the Rep was a 
"seminal theatre," a company aimed at 
innovative concepts and techniques 
which could be considered controver-
sial, but which represented a signifi-
cant contribution to the development 
of the theatre art. 

Until recently, the two theatres were 
the dramatic correlative of the town-
gown duality, and it was not difficult to 
guess a theatregoer's tastes and views 
according to his or her subscription. 

Instead of the established playwrights 
cherished by the Long Wharf (Arthur 
Miller, Tennessee Williams, 
Noel 
Coward, Neil Simon), the Rep gave its 
audiences European avant-garde (Alfred Jarry's 
Ubu, Brecht's Baal), young American 
dramatists (Sam Shephard, Bob Aulet-
ta, Chris Durang), and unusual sta-
gings, such as the production of 
Aristophanes' The Frogs in the swim-
ming pool of Payne-Whitney gym. 

Brustein admitted recently in his 
book Making Scenes that he respected 
the Long Wharf "for its craft and com-
petence," but added, "I didn't find it a 
very adventurous theatre. The basic 
style of the Long Wharf was domestic 
realism- plays in which people discuss 
their problems over hot meals- and 
this made it a congenial resting place 
for 
the middle-class 
New Haven 
population, lulled by the sight of 
familiar lives on stage." 

Actually, there were mistakes and 
shortcomings on both sides. The Long 
Wharf succeeded in complying to the 
tastes of a huge constituency of about 
15,000 subscribers, but lacked clear ar-
tistic guidelines to define the company 
and its aims; for some time, it faced a 
sort of "identity crisis." The Rep, on 
the contrary, never reached the mark 
of6,000 subscribers and often operated 
with half of its seats empty; but it 
boasted the monopoly of dramatic 
truth and went through a peculiar love-
it-or-leave-it phase. 

Today the situation seems quite dif-
ferent: 
time and experience have 
bridged the gap between the Long 
Wharf and the Yale Rep, so that the 
town-and-gown dichotomy is no longer 
a dramatic conflict-onstage, at least. 

The Rep, under Lloyd Richards' ar-
tistic directorship, has balanced its 
repertory and become less controver-
sial in its production concepts, so that 
the campus' limits are no longer the 
University theatre's boundaries. As 
Richards said in a recent interview, to-
day's Rep is "a repository keeping alive 
the old, as well as giving birth to the 
new and innovative." One attempt at 
innovation is the Winterfest, now play-
ing at the Rep. This festival gives four 
young American playwrights an op-
portunity to see their new works on 
stage, even if they are still works-in-
progress. 

The Long Wharf, in turn, has 
grown increasingly selective and dar-
ing in its choice of plays, partly

because the audience itself, with the 
passing of the seasons, became more 
demanding. The theater now takes 
more risks with new playwrights and 
controversial works:  Stuarts, American 
Buffalo, Sizwe Banzi is Dead, The Blood 
Knot, and  Lakeboat are some recent ex-
amples. Like the Rep's Winterfest, the 
Long Wharf's Stage II, which opened 
two years ago, provides an opportunity 
to perform new works that could be too 
commercially risky for the main stage. 

Though the two companies are 
closer than they have been in the past, 
they still retain the distinctive features 
which have shaped their reputations. 

The Rep is still a theatre of ideas, while 
the Long Wharf puts a priority on 
entertainment over cultural concerns. 
-------------------------------
Works by Bernard Shaw, for instance, 
figure in both theatres' repertories 
-but in very different ways. 

The Rep staged this fall one of 
Shaw's most polemic texts, Mrs. War-
ren's Profession, 
which was banned in 
New Haven in the beginning of the 
century because of its "'immoral" sub-
ject-how decent people make a good 
living out of prostitution. Shaw writes 
in his preface to the play: 
. rich nun 
without conviction are more dangerous in 
modern society than poor women without 
chastity. Hardly a pleasant subject this! I 
must, however, warn my readers that my at-
tacks are directed against themselves, not 
against my stage figures. 

The Long Wharf's Shaw, scheduled 
to run from May 20 to June 27, is

duality. 

much more genteel and pleasant. The 
Doctor's Dilemma is a stimulating and 
skillful comedy, in which a doctor who 
happens to have just one place at the 
hospital must choose which of two pa-
tients will be admitted for cure- and 
the choice is to be made between a 
great artist and a mediocre doctor, that 
is, a healer of souls and a healer of 
bodies. A vital theme, indeed; brilliant 
as well as harmless, this intellectual ex-
ercise on applied ethics has nothing of 
the aggressiveness of Mrs. 
Warren. 

Characteristically, the Long Wharf 
combines the wish to play Shaw with 
the wisdom to play safe. 

The Rep's attempt to present uni-
versal subjects and social concerns 
achieved a coherent balance of feeling, 
thought and myth this season: a basic 
theme- the meaning, 
nature and 
value of the human life and work-
pervaded 
its 
three 
first 
plays. 

Chekhov's Uncle Vanya questioned the 
meaning of an unfulfilled life, wasted 
out in irrelevant and obscure work; 
Shaw's Mrs. 
Warren's Profession dis-
cussed the morals and the very nature 
of work and profit in modern society; 
Richard Nelson's Rip Van Winkle, an 
American "epic," dealt with the transi-
tion of an agricultural society to the 
world of factory and industry, and 
therefore from self-independence to in-
terdependence. The individual's prob-
lems are thus placed against a more 
general backdrop: the social context, 
philosophical concerns and historical 
change. 

The Long Wharf, on the contrary, 
focuses on the individual, brings his 
personal drama and psychological 
problems to the proscenium, and dims 
out the lights on the social, ideological 
or historical settings. In the 1981 
season, John Hopkins' This Story of 
Yours dramatized the mental and emo-
tional disintegration of a cop accused 
of killing a supposed pervert; the 
beautiful revival of Peter Nichols' A 
Day in the Death of Joe Egg showed a cou-
ple who desperately tried to overcome 
the heartbreak of raising their spastic 
child; and Arthur Miller's A View from 
the Bridge, 
an American "classic," 
followed a dockworker's tragic path 
from unconscious passion to self-
destruction. 

In upcoming plays, the same dif-
ferences are evident. With Lakeboat, 
the Long Wharf brings the introspec-
tion of young author David Mamet, 
while the Rep welcomes back the 
humanistically committed South-
African playwright Athol Fugard with 
his new play Master Harold . . . and the 
Boys. In comedy, the contrast is still 
more striking: Noel Coward's Waiting 
in the Wings at the Long Wharf, and 
Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Lost at the 
Rep. 

These distinctions appear not only 
in the choice of the repertory; they are 
evident also in the work of the 
dramaturgs or literary managers of 
both companies, as expressed in their 
program notes. The Long Wharf's pro-
gram provides merely the basic infor-
mation for an event considered as self-
sufficient and complete in itself; the 
Rep's more substantial program notes, 
suggest that such experience should go 
deeper and further, even beyond the 
theatre walls and the actual time of the 
performance. Ultimately, the Long 
Wharf informs the audience so that it 
may fully enjoy the show; the Rep, 
more demanding, provides the means 
for the audience to become more 
critical and active. This is not a simple 
matter of style or of taste: though 
things have changed over time, two 
different conceptions of the theatrical 
experience are still at play.
