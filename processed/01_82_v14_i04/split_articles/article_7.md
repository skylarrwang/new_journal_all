debate 
that 
wasn't 
W. Hampton Sides 

More than four months after President 
A. Bartlett Giamatti released his con-
troversial address to the freshmen on 
the perils of the "new coercion," the 
Moral Majority was still furious. Cal 
Thomas, Vice President and chief 
spokesman for Moral Majority, Inc., 
spoke stridently in his cramped office 
in Lynchburg, Virginia: "I think Dr. 
Giamatti's refusal 
to debate Dr. 
Falwell or myself- where he made 
these unsubstantiated and scurrilous 
charges- is not in the great tradition of 
Yale University as a seat of free 
thought. 

"I think he is a chicken and I would 
be happy to call that to his face. The 
low class of his remarks leaves me 
nothing to fear from a personal and 
even intellectual confrontation with 
him and I would renew the challenge. I 
think we could present Dr. Falwell up 
there (at Yale)-and he's interested in 
going- if Giamatti would simply stop 
hiding behind the intellectual 
equivalent of his mother's skirts, and 
come out and fight like a man." 

The Political Union invited Presi-
dent Giamatti in September to debate 
Jerry Falwell or Cal Thomas at Yale, 
but Giamatti promptly declined. "I 
have said what I have to say on this 
topic and see no point in pursuing the 
issue any further at this time," wrote 
the President in his letter to Dan 
Williams, former Political Union Vice 
President for Debate. 

The P. U. was not the only organiza-
tion calling at Woodbridge Hall after 
the address. Major network programs 
such as 60 Minutes, Donahue and Today 
phoned the President for interviews, 
sensing an ideological storm brewing 
along the news horizon. But Giamatti 
flatly 
turned 
these 
offers 
down, 
distressing those who had envisioned a 
profitable controversy ringing from the 
gothic towers in New Haven to the 
church-steepled 
hills of southern 
Virginia. "I presume that 60 Minutes 
was intending to cut taped interviews 
of Falwell and myself to present them 
like a debate," said Giamatti. 

For over three months Giamatti 
maintained a conspicuously low pro-
file. Between the release of the speech 
and January of 1982, he made only 
one public reference to the Moral Ma-
jority, which occurred on December 18 
in a Today show interview about the 
President's new book, The University and 
the Public Interest. 

So, long after the liberals applauded 
and the conservatives raged, after 
some had speculated 
that the 
President's fulminous attack on the 
Moral Majority was politically 
motivated and others claimed he had 
not done his homework, the question 
of Giamatti's silence still remained. If 
the Moral Majority posed the threat to 
liberal education that the scope of 
Giamatti's charges and the strength of 
his language indicated, then why did 
the president not continue to speak out 
against these "peddlers of coercion"? 

In his first interview about the 
Moral Majority since the address, 
Giamatti explained his silence. "I saw 
no point in swapping dogmas with 
Falwell or anyone else from the Moral 
Majority," he said. Giamatti felt that 
the debate devised by the P. U. "would 
go nowhere" because there was no pre-
arranged central issue. He said he did 
not consider himself an authority on 
the Moral Majority: "I don't know 
whether the Moral Majority is a foun-
dation, a movement, a legal entity, a 
political action committee- clearly it is 
all of these things." He admitted, 
President Giamatti explained his silence after 
the speech.

rather candidly, that he had done no 
special research on the organization for 
his address, but had relied instead on 
"what I had already read or seen. 
Intolerant spirit 

"That wasn't a speech about the Moral 
Majority, although the newspapers 
certainly interpreted it as such," ex-
plained the President. He claimed that 
in the address he was not concerned 
with the Moral Majority per se, so 
much as with a "spirit, a gust, an aura 
sweeping the country today that legit-
imizes intolerance ... The Moral 
Majority was only a kind of illustrative 
example of a strand that is pressing 
people in a direction that I didn't think 
was useful to liberal education." 

And while the President wanted to 
make public these concerns, he was 
wary of acquiring a reputation for be-
ing a "single-issue president." He was 
concerned with the Moral Majority 
only insofar as the organization related 
to the broader subject of liberal educa-
tion, his primary interest. 

In fact, Giamatti did not rule out the 
possibility for a debate with Jerry 
Falwell in the future, provided that the 
topic be confined to the principles of a 
liberal education. Giamatti recognized 
that Falwell, aside from being Presi-
dent of Moral Majority and a minister, 
is also an educator in the process of 
building Liberty Baptist College on the 
outskirts of Lynchburg. "I have never 
been shy about talking on the prin-
ciples of a liberal education, and I will 
debate anyone on the subject," said 
Giamatti. The President also men-
tioned William F. Buckley as a possible 
candidate for debate on the subject of 
education. 

The Political Union is pursuing a 
debate that will feature Giamatti and 
another spokesman for liberal educa-
tion, probably Buckley. "I can only say 
that there is a good possibility that 
Giamatti and Buckley will debate this 
term," said Andrea Charters, current 
P.U. Vice President for debate. She 
also said that either Jerry Falwell or 
Cal Thomas would probably appear at 
Yale this term to speak about the 
Moral Majority. 

However popular a debate between 
Giamatti and Buckley will be, it will 
serve as no substitute for the Political 
Union's original plan. The Giamatti-
Falwell conflict had all the makings of a 
classical debate from the very begin-
ning. The New York Times immediate-
ly played up the address as a new of-
fensive in the "ancient battle of creeds," 
pitting secular humanism against 
religious fundamentalism. 

Time 
jumped 
on the inflammatory issue with 
an inset story on Giamatti that was 
headed "A Humanist Hits Back." 

Newsweek read the speech similarly, 
and then two months later presented 
Jerry Falwell in its regular "My Turn" 
column. Newspapers and magazines 
throughout the country were restaging 
the age-old square-off between the 
William Jennings Bryan and the 
Clarence Darrow of the 1980s. 

Although the likelihood of any sort 
of personal confrontation between 
Giamatti and Thomas now appears 
slim, The New Journal was able to talk 
privately with both men about some of 
the issues raised in the freshman ad-
dress. Giamatti in his high-ceilinged 
office 
in Woodbridge Hall and 
Thomas in his tighter, messier room at 
the Moral Majority Headquarters 
voiced many of the same concerns, but 
the two men raised widely different 
arguments about how to interpret the 
freshmen address. 

Imposing morality? 

Giamatti believes that the Moral Ma-
jority frames 
its arguments 
in 
dogmatic language and forms 
its 
judgments out of a rigid moral cast 
that discourages open discussion and 
legitimizes the blind imposition of law 
by decree. "(The Moral Majority) 
would displace law with polyester 
mysticism," he wrote, "and would 
presume to impose a final, complete, 
arbitrary contour on society, and the 
behavior of individuals." 

But Thomas argues that a moral 
viewpoint lies at the root of almost all 
legislation. "The idea of an imposition 
of morality is silly," said Thomas. 
"Because all law is the imposition of 
somebody's morality to the exclusion of 
someone else's. We have laws against 
murder, incest, rape, cannibalism, 
among others; there are a lot of people 
walking around the streets who'd like 
to rape people. There are some that 
do, but there are others who don't

because they are constrained by a law 
against it. Somebody's morality is be-
ing imposed to keep them from doing 
that." Thomas believes that "secular 
humanist" legislators in Washington 
and in state capitals have imposed their 
morality on the United States for 
decades, 
while 
the majority of 
Americans have silently watched the 
steady erosion of traditional, pro-
family values. 

Giamatti, however, emphasized that 
his concern with the Moral Majority 
was not so much with the substance of 
its views as with the manner in which it 
presents them. "The Moral Majority 
has identified some tremendously im-
portant moral and social problems. I 
don't, 
however, 
happen 
to agree 
necessarily with the terms in which 
they frame their debate. I said in the 
speech that most of their positions I 
fully agreed with and held them too. 
But when you shove people into 
rhetorical corners and push them 
around, that does not allow much 
room to differ ... It was a style, not a 
condition, that I was arguing against," 
he explained. 

Thomas denied that the Moral Ma-
jority uses coercive tactics or religious 
pressure to gain supporters. He re-
peatedly stressed that Moral Majority, 
Inc., is not a religious organization, 
but a political one, composed of a 
variety of faiths, and even agnostics. 
"It doesn't matter a twit to us whether 
they go to church-we want them on 
the issues," said Thomas. 

The Moral Majority has never ad-
vocated mandatory prayer or the
